SUMMARY OF CHANGES This publication has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes include updating “Chaplain Service” to “Chaplain Corps.” In addition, an Outstanding Religious Support Team (RST) award has been added as well as changes to major headings in team award categories. 2 AFI36-2811 28 NOVEMBER 2014 1. Description of Awards. This awards program is for Air Force Chief of Chaplains-level awards and is designed to foster morale, incentive and esprit-de-corps. Teams and individuals receiving awards under this program must clearly demonstrate sustained and superior performance. All teams and individuals submitted who meet the selection criteria will be considered. Award categories and suspenses for award nominations are listed in Table 1. 1.1. Team Awards: (Award Period is 1 January – 31 December) 1.1.1. Outstanding Large Chapel Team (Charles I. Carpenter Award). This award honors the late Chaplain, Major General Charles I.

Begin paragraph by explaining why you are nominating this individual, a specific event that made this individual special to you and how he/she has influenced your life through their selfless and sacrificial service. Include a closing line expressing gratitude for this individual. EXAMPLE: When I was assigned to Base X as a brand new airman basic I, like many others, had no sense of direction in my life. Soon after arriving at the base, I went to see a chaplain who got me and others involved with the singles ministry…there were several airmen who were struggling with the challenges of military life who found encouragement and help there. Chaplain XXXXX's commitment to our growth went beyond the base chapel. He mentored me as a Christian, an Airman, and later helped me recognize a calling to the ministry and with his encouragement I had the confidence to return to seminary. Thank you XXXXX for taking the time to notice me when so many others did not. Thank you for looking deeper into my life and into the lives of so many others and seeing what God could do. Thank you for the great love and commitment you gave all of us through your career. I thank God for you and only hope I can follow your example.

Begin paragraph by explaining why  you are nominating this individual, a specific event that  made  this  individual  special  to  you  and  how  he/she  has  influenced  your  life  through  their selfless and sacrificial service. When  I was assigned to  Base X as  a brand new  airman basic  I, like many others,  had  no  sense  of  direction  in  my  life. Soon  after  arriving  at  the  base,  I  went  to  see  a chaplain who got me and others involved with the singles ministry …there were several  airmen who  were  struggling  with  the  challenges  of  military  life  who  found  encouragement  and  help there. He mentored me as a Christian, an  Airman, and later helped me recognize a calling to the ministry and with his encouragement I had the confidence to return to seminary. Thank you XXXXX for taking the time to notice me when so many others did not. Thank you  for  looking  deeper  into  my  life  and  into  the  lives  of  so  many  others  and  seeing  what  God could do. Thank you for the great love and commitment you gave all of us through your career.\n"
