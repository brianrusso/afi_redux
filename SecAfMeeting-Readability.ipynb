NOTE: MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs/Units are encouraged to incorporate all non AF tasks under a related STS task and expand the new requirement in existing AF POIs, which will help eliminate the need for AF Form 797s and extraneous documentation.</span><span>7.1.2.</span><span>2. AF ATP.</span></p><p><span class=\"yellow\">The ATP takes selected training received during initial training and applies it throughout the year for recurring training and proficiency.</span><span>7.1.3.</span><span class=\"yellow\">POI. POIs represent the minimum training standard for all tasks represented in the MTL and STS.</span></p><p><span class=\"yellow\">By successfully completing a POI(s) teaching step(s), trainees achieve

pre-existing conditions (when applicable), available resources (if applicable), allowable evaluator/trainer assists/errors, and a timeliness standard (when applicable) to clearly evaluate controller accuracy, timeliness, and correct use of procedures in meeting the learning objective.</span><span>7.1.5.</span><span>Develop Unit Training Plan.</span></p><p><span class=\"orange\">The UTP is a
