   DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE HEADQUARTERS UNITED STATES AIR FORCE WASHINGTON, DC      AFI13-1CRCV2_AFGM2017-01  7 September 2017  MEMORANDUM FOR  DISTRIBUTION C   MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs FROM:  HQ USAF/A3               1480 Air Force Pentagon               Washington DC 20330-1480  SUBJECT:  Air Force Guidance Memorandum (AFGM) for AFI 13-1CRC Vol. 2   By Order of the Secretary of the Air Force, this Guidance Memorandum immediately implements changes to AFI 13-1CRC Vol. 2, Control and Reporting Center Evaluation Criteria.  Specifically, this AFGM provides clarification to conduct mission evaluations.  A separate AFGM publication to AFI 13-1 STANDARDIZATION/EVALUATION, Vol. 2 will ensure the amplifying information is incorporated.   This guidance’s intention is to address how CRCs, transitioning to the AN/TYQ-23A weapons system, will include the Mobile Training Suite (MTS) and the Mission Training Center (MTC) located at Tinker AFB, Oklahoma to aid in conducting mission evaluations until system conversion is complete.  This Memorandum becomes void after one year has elapsed from its date, or upon incorporation by AFI 13-1CRC Volume 2. There are no release restrictions on this memorandum.      MARK C. NOWLAND, Lt Gen, USAF Deputy Chief of Staff, Operations      Attachment AFI 13-1 CRC Vol. 2_AFGM-1, SUMMARY OF REVISIONS   AFI 13-1 CRC Vol. 2_AFGM-1 CONTROL AND REPORTING CENTER EVALUATION CRITERIA  1 Aug 2017  *SUMMARY OF REVISIONS  This Guidance Memorandum (GM) provides clarification for the conduct of mission evaluations.  *1.1.1.  The criteria apply to all Regular Air Force (RegAF); Air Force Reserve (AFR); and/or Air National Guard (ANG), Combat Mission Ready  (CMR) and Basic Mission Capable (BMC) operations crew members performing duties in  Modular Control Equipment (MCE) equipped units.  Throughout this instruction, AFSC 13B  refers to Air Battle Managers (ABM) and Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) 1C5X1D refers  to Weapons Directors (WD).  NOTE: For CRCs (transitioning to the AN/TYQ-23A system), assigned weapon system includes the Mobile Training Suite (MTS) and the Mission Training Center (MTC) located at Tinker AFB.  *1.4.2.  Examiners conduct evaluations IAW this AFI. Examiners administer positional evaluations only within their weapon system/crew specialty and only evaluate those mission/skill sets in which they maintain qualification unless specifically authorized in this instruction.  NOTE: For CRCs (transitioning to the AN/TYQ-23A system), assigned weapon system includes the Mobile Training Suite (MTS) and the Mission Training Center (MTC) located at Tinker AFB.  * 2.3.1.1.  Mission Simulator Evaluations. Simulations (constructive events) may be used to administer any portion of a positional evaluation not requiring a specific live/virtual scenario.  Unit SEEs will identify existing simulation scenarios which include adequate activity to meet the evaluation requirements for the required events.  If adequate scenarios do not exist, unit Stan/Eval personnel will develop scenario outlines for the simulation activity to be conducted to ensure standardization of both the level of activity and the difficulty for simulation evaluations (T-3).  The SEE’s judgment will be the determining factor in the effective use of simulation (T-3).  NOTE: For CRCs (transitioning to the AN/TYQ-23A system), assigned weapon system includes the Mobile Training Suite (MTS) and the Mission Training Center (MTC) located at Tinker AFB. 2  BY ORDER OF THE  SECRETARY OF THE AIR FORCE AIR FORCE INSTRUCTION 13-1CRC, VOLUME 2 16 APRIL 2015 Nuclear, Space, Missile, Command and Control  CONTROL AND REPORTING CENTER EVALUATION CRITERIA  COMPLIANCE WITH THIS PUBLICATION IS MANDATORY ACCESSIBILITY:  Publications and Forms are available for downloading or ordering on the e-Publishing website at www.e-Publishing.af.mil.

Waiver  authority  for  requirements  of  this  volume  will  be  IAW  AFI-33-360, Publications  and  Forms  Management(T-3).   Waiver  requests  must  come  from commanders  (or  civilian  directors)  of  the  affected  unit  seeking  relief  from  compliance through the command chain up to the appropriate tier approval authority (i.e., Tier 0, 1, 2, 3) (or publications approval authority if non-tiered)(T-3).  See AFI 33-360 for definition of Tier Ratings. 1.3.2.1.1.  Waiver  requests  will  be  sent  via  email  or  memorandum,  and  include  the following (T-3): 1.3.2.1.1.1.  Reference  and  text  of  the  specific  requirement  for  which  the commander/director is requesting a waiver. 1.3.2.1.1.2.  Rationale  for  the  waiver:  Explain  which  of  the  following  three reasons IAW AFI 33-360, apply and describe why; 1.3.2.1.1.2.1.  The  cost  of  compliance  creates  unacceptable  risk  to  a  higher priority task; 1.3.2.1.1.2.2.  The expected cost of compliance outweighs the benefit; 1.3.2.1.1.2.3.  Personnel cannot comply with the requirement due to a lack of resources (training, funds, equipment, facilities, guidance or manpower). 1.3.2.1.1.3.  Time  period  or  circumstance  for  which  the  waiver  will  be  required (T-3). 1.3.2.1.1.4.  Risk  mitigation measures the requesting commander will implement during the waiver period (T-3). 1.3.2.1.1.5.  Impact if waiver is disapproved. 1.3.2.1.1.6.  Approved  waivers  will  be  uploaded  into  the  unit’s  Management Internal  Control  Toolset  (MICT)  for  inspection  activity  review  and  publication OPR’s situational awareness/filing (T-2). 1.3.3.  USAFE-AFAFRICA/A3C,  PACAF/A8X,  and  NGB/A3Y  will  forward  a  copy  of  all approved waivers for their units to ACC/A3C. (T-2).  ACC/A3C will, in turn, forward a copy of  all  approved  waivers  for  their  units  to  USAFE-AFAFRICA/A3C,  PACAF/A8X,  and NGB/A3Y.  (T-2).    Units  will  forward  all  approved  waivers  and  report  all  deviations  or exceptions without waiver, through their chain of command to MAJCOM OPR (T-2). 1.3.4.  Approval/denial of waiver requests will be completed IAW AFI 33-360, 1.9.4.3 (T-2). 1.3.5.  Duration of waivers will be IAW AFI 33-360 and may be approved for a period not to exceed  the  requested  waiver  period  or  30  calendar  days  after  the  approving  commander’s tour  length,  whichever  is  shorter.    Because  waivers  are  the  expression  of  a  specific commander  accepting  risk,  Tier  1,  2,  and  3  waivers  automatically  expire  30  days  after  a change of command unless the new commander renews the waiver. 1.3.6.  Unless  directed  by  the  waiver  authority,  trainees  continue  to  train  while  waiver requests are being staffed. 1.3.7.

The primary methods of determining the examinee’s level of job knowledge  and  proficiency  are  academic  testing  and  observation  of  job  performance.    The questioning  of  examinees  during  the  positional  portion  of  the  evaluation  will  be  limited  to items  not  determined  by  observation,  but  related  to  the  scenarios  being  employed  for evaluation (T-3). 1.4.2.  Examiners  conduct  evaluations  IAW  this  AFI.    Examiners  administer  positional evaluations  only  within  their  weapon  system/crew  specialty  and  only  evaluate  those mission/skill  sets  in  which  they  maintain  qualification  unless  specifically  authorized  in  this instruction. 1.4.3.  Evaluation Procedures.  The examiner will provide the examinee a briefing explaining how  the  evaluation  will  be  conducted  (T-3).    The  examinee  will  accomplish  all  mission planning  appropriate  for  the  type  of  evaluation  (T-3).    The  examiner  will  evaluate  the examinee’s performance for each  graded area  and note discrepancies when deviations from prescribed  performance  criteria  occur  during  the  evaluation  (T-3).    The  judgment  of  the examiner  will  be  the  determining  factor  in  assigning  the  overall  grade  for  the  examinee’s performance (T-3). 1.4.3.1.  Prior to Evaluation.  The SEE explains the purpose of the evaluation and how it is  conducted.    The  examinee  will  accomplish  all  mission  planning  appropriate  for  the type of evaluation (T-3). 1.4.3.2.  During Evaluation.  The SEE will evaluate the examinee's performance for each graded area and note discrepancies when deviations from prescribed performance criteria occur during the evaluation (T-3). 1.4.3.3.  Post  Evaluation.    The  SEE  will  compare  the  examinee's  performance  with  the grading criteria and will assign an appropriate grade for each area (T-3).  The SEE will consider cumulative momentary deviations (T-3).  The judgment of the SEE will be the determining  factor  in  assigning  an  overall  grade  for  the  examinee's  performance  (T-3).  The SEE will thoroughly critique all aspects of the evaluation (T-3).  During this critique, the  SEE  will  review  the  examinee's  overall  rating,  specific  deviations,  area  grades assigned, and any additional training which the examinee will be required to complete (T-3).    All  initial  qualification  or  initial  instructor  evaluations  resulting  in  Exceptionally Qualified (EQ), Qualified 2 (Q2), or Q3 will be debriefed with the examinee's squadron commander/operations  officer  (or  designated  representative)  and  flight  commander  (or designated representative) (T-3). 1.4.3.4.  The examiner will not occupy a primary crew position during the evaluation (T-3). 1.4.4.  Acceptance and conduct of evaluations from outside the parent MAJCOM. 1.4.4.1.  Evaluations  will  be  accepted  between  ACC,  USAFE-AFAFRICA,  AETC,  and ANG CRCs (T-3). 1.4.4.2.  Unit  examiners  may  give  evaluations  outside  of  their  organization,  to  include administering  evaluations  outside  of  their  MAJCOM.    If  administering  evaluations outside of the examiner’s MAJCOM, the evaluation will be specifically requested by the AFI13-1CRCV2  16 APRIL 2015   9  MAJCOM Stan Eval organization of the examinee and approved by the MAJCOM Stan Eval organization of the examiner IAW AFI 13-1STAN/EVAL Vol. 2 (T-2). 1.4.5.  SEE Objectivity Evaluations.  SEE Objectivity Evaluations will be given IAW AFI13-1STAN/EVAL Vol. 2, paragraph 5.2.5.2 after initial selection as a SEE and at the discretion and direction of the unit CC thereafter (T-3). 1.5.  Grading Policies 1.5.1.  Examiners  will  use  the  rating  policy  contained  in  AFI  13-1STAN/EVAL  Vol.  2  and the  evaluation  criteria  in  this  instruction  for  conducting  evaluations  (T-2).    Use  of  these criteria  will  ensure  standard  and  objective  evaluations  are  administered  to  crew  members.  SEEs and crew members will be thoroughly familiar with  the prescribed  grading  criteria in this regulation.  A three-tier grading system (Q, Q-, or Unqualified (U)) will be used for all areas except those designated as CRITICAL, in which case a two-tier grading system (Q or U) will be used (T-2).  An overall rating of “Unqualified” could  result from  an unqualified rating of a single critical or multiple noncritical areas. 1.5.2.  Critical Areas.  Critical grading areas have been established for evaluations.   Critical areas are defined as events that require adequate accomplishment by the examinee in order to successfully  achieve  the  mission  objectives  and  complete  the  evaluation.    If  an  examinee receives  a  "U"  grade  in  any  critical  area,  the  overall  grade  for  the  evaluation  will  also  be unqualified  (T-3).    Critical  areas  are  identified  by  "(CRITICAL)"  following  the  applicable area title. 1.5.3.  Crew members receiving an overall Q-3 on either their QUAL or MSN evaluation will be  immediately  downgraded  to  UQ  status  and  must  complete  a  RQ  IAW  AFI  13-1STAN/EVAL Vol. 2 (T-3).   10  AFI13-1CRCV2  16 APRIL 2015 Chapter 2 EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS  2.1.  General.  All  evaluations  follow  the  guidelines  set  in  AFI  13-1STAN/EVAL  Vol.  2. Evaluation requirements are depicted in each crew position's evaluation criteria section. 2.1.1.  Required  Evaluation  Areas.    Required  evaluation  areas  are  defined  as  all  areas  (and associated  sub-areas)  annotated  with  an  “R”  in  this  document.    The  examiner  evaluates  the examinee's  performance  in  all  required  areas.    Required  areas  may  be  graded  using simulation or a verbal evaluation when a required area cannot be evaluated during live/virtual operations because of equipment malfunctions, weather conditions, operational requirements, or  lack  of  adequate  operating  airspace.    Examiners  will  make  every  effort  to  evaluate  all required areas during the live/virtual portion before resorting to this alternative (T-3).  If an alternate evaluation method is used, the examiner documents the method under the Mission Description  paragraph  in  the  Remarks  section  of  the  AF  Form  8,  Certification  of  Aircrew Qualification, IAW AFI 13-1STAN/EVAL Vol. 2. 2.2.  Ground  Phase  Requisites.  The  following  qualification  (QUAL)  evaluation  requisites  are common to all crew positions and will be accomplished IAW AFI 13-1STAN/EVAL Vol. 2 and unit  directives  (T-3).    The  examinee  must  satisfy  all  ground  phase  requisites  within  their eligibility  period  to  complete  recurring  evaluations  (T-3).    These  requisites  will  be  recorded under the Ground Phase area, Section II of the AF Form 8 (T-2). 2.2.1.  Closed  Book  Requisite  Exam.    Closed  book  questions  will  come  from  Master Question File (MQF)/Local Operating Procedures (LOP) IAW AFI 13-1STAN/EVAL Vol. 2 (T-3).    For  initial  evaluations,  all  academic  examinations  will  be  completed  prior  to  any positional portions of the evaluation unless waived by the unit commander on a case-by-case basis (T-3).  For RQ evaluations the written examinations will be completed at the discretion of the Chief, Stan Eval (T-3).  Crew members with more than one qualification will complete all applicable closed book exams (T-3). 2.3.  Mission  Evaluation.  The  mission  (MSN)  evaluation  will  be  conducted  IAW  AFI  13-1STAN/EVAL Vol. 2 (T-3).  Crew members with more than one qualification will complete the MSN evaluation in all applicable crew positions (T-3). 2.3.1.  Mission Profiles.  When conducting positional MSN evaluations, mission profiles will accomplish  the  following  (T-3):    reflect  unit  daily  training  mission  and  unit  DOC  tasking, provide  realistic  assessment  of  examinee  capabilities,  and  provide  assessment  of  the application of current tactics.  Evaluation profiles will be defined by the unit and will include a  scenario  and  other  pertinent  information  that  would  normally  be  available  in  theater (Special  Instructions  (SPINS),  Air  Tasking  Order  (ATO),  Airspace  Control  Order  (ACO), Operational  Tasking  Data  Link  (OPTASK  LINK),  intelligence  data  such  as  air  and  ground order of battle, and political assessment, etc.) (T-3).  Mission evaluations may be conducted in the live/virtual/constructive environment IAW AFI 13-1STAN/EVAL Vol. 2. 2.3.1.1.  Mission Simulator Evaluations.  Simulations (constructive events) may be used to  administer  any  portion  of  a  positional  evaluation  not  requiring  a  specific  live/virtual scenario.   Unit  SEEs will identify  existing simulation scenarios which include adequate activity  to  meet  the  evaluation  requirements  for  the  required  events.    If  adequate AFI13-1CRCV2  16 APRIL 2015   11  scenarios  do  not  exist,  unit  Stan  Eval  personnel  will  develop  scenario  outlines  for  the simulation activity to be conducted to ensure standardization of both the level of activity and  the  difficulty  for  simulation  evaluations  (T-3).    The  SEE’s  judgment  will  be  the determining factor in the effective use of simulation (T-3). 2.4.  Instructor Evaluation.  All crew members selected for instructor duty must be evaluated to determine  their  judgment,  technical  knowledge,  instructor  ability  (including  error  analysis  of student activity), and use of grading documents as well as proficiency in their duty position (T-3).    To  initially  qualify  as  an  instructor,  a  crew  member  must  successfully  complete  an  initial instructor evaluation (T-3).  Subsequent evaluations of instructors are conducted during recurring evaluations in which individuals are qualified to instruct. 2.4.1.  Instructors  must  demonstrate  proficiency  by  instructing  a  student  (or  qualified individual  acting  as  a  student)  (T-3).    The  examiner  may  require  the  examinee  to  present verbal  explanations  of  equipment  operations,  procedures,  and  techniques  pertinent  to  their crew position duties and responsibilities. 2.4.2.  Instructor  evaluations  will  be  conducted  with  a  student  occupying  the  applicable position  whenever  possible  (T-3).    The  student  performs  those  duties  prescribed  by  the instructor for the mission being accomplished.  The instructor examinee monitors all phases of the mission from an advantageous position and be prepared to demonstrate or explain any area or procedure.  The SEE will particularly note the instructor's ability to recognize student difficulties and provide effective, timely corrective action (T-3).  Recurring evaluations will be  administered  in  conjunction  with  required  qualification  evaluations  and  will  include  all areas using both qualification and instructor criteria (T-3). 2.4.3.  During  qualification  evaluations  of  qualified  instructors,  the  examinee  must  assume the  seat  position  for  a  period  of  time  of  sufficient  length  to  demonstrate  proficiency  in  the crew position (T-3).  The determination of what represents a sufficient length of time is left to  the  judgment  of  the  SEE.    The  portion  of  the  mission  during  which  the  examinee  will occupy the seat position can be determined by the SEE during mission planning or during the course of the mission (T-3). 2.4.4.  All instructors will be graded using the following criteria (T-3): 2.4.4.1.  INSTRUCTIONAL ABILITY   Demonstrated  ability 2.4.4.1.1.  Q.

This  chapter  contains  the  criteria  specifying  the  tasks  required  of  a  qualified Senior Director (SD) IAW AFI 13-1STAN/EVAL Vol. 2.  Evaluation requirements are outlined in Table 4.1 for SD and Instructor Senior Director (ISD). 4.1.1.  Evaluation Objectives. 4.1.1.1.  Qualification  Evaluation.    The  examinee  will  be  evaluated  on  his/her  ability  to accomplish  required  tasks  safely  and  effectively,  IAW  technical  orders,  manuals, directives,  and  operating  procedures  applicable  to  the  evaluated  mission  (T-3).  Qualification evaluations will encompass all areas identified in  Table  4.1 (T-3).  When possible,  the  evaluation  should  be  conducted  with  a  full  operational  crew.    When  a  full operations  crew  cannot  be  established,  the  SD  will  supervise  a  minimum  of  two  WDs conducting control missions in the live/virtual environment with a crew composition able to  meet  the  intent  of  the  QUAL  evaluation  to  ensure  adequate  crew  coordination  is accomplished (T-3).  This is documented in the Mission Description of the AF Form 8.  The  examinee  must  demonstrate  a  degree  of  knowledge  and  proficiency  essential  for successful  mission  accomplishment  and  safety  of  flight  (T-3).    The  qualification evaluation  will  include  assessing  the  examinee’s  ability  to  successfully  accomplish  the areas  in  Paragraph  4.2  and  control  a  live/virtual  mission  (T-3).    The  control  mission profile must meet the minimum requirements of Paragraphs 4.1.1.4.1 through 4.1.1.4.2 (T-3).    SEEs  will  make  the  determination  as  to  whether  briefed/conducted  control activities  fulfill  control  requirements  (T-3).    The  live/virtual  mission  does  not  have  to conform  to  a  specific  profile  (e.g.,  Offensive  or  Defensive  Counterair)  if  the  unit  is unable to schedule aircraft to conduct such a mission; however, the examinee will not be evaluated  solely  on  the  control  of  an  air  refueling  mission  (T-3).    During  the  QUAL evaluation,  Counterair  and  Air  Refueling  control  must  be  evaluated  (T-3).    Tasks  not observed  and  assessed  during  the  course  of  the  evaluation  will  be  evaluated  separately while the examinee is on position (T-3).  When possible the evaluation will be conducted in  a  controlled  radar  and  communications  jamming  environment;  otherwise,  radar  and communications jamming may be simulated (T-3). 4.1.1.2.  Mission  Evaluation.    The  examinee  will  be  evaluated  on  his/her  ability  to accomplish  required  tasks  safely  and  effectively,  IAW  technical  orders,  manuals, directives,  and  operating  procedures  applicable  to  the  evaluation  areas  table    (T-3).  Mission  evaluations  will  encompass  all  required  areas  identified  in  Table  4.1  for  the mission  profile  performed  (T-3).    SD  mission  evaluations  will  be  conducted,  to  the maximum extent possible with a full operations crew (T-3).  When a full operations crew cannot be established, the crew composition will be such to meet the intent of the MSN evaluation  to  ensure  adequate  crew  coordination  is  accomplished  (T-3).    This  is documented  in  the  Mission  Description  of  the  AF  Form  8.    The  examinee  must demonstrate  a  degree  of  knowledge  and  proficiency  essential  for  successful  mission accomplishment,  profile execution, and safety of  flight  (T-3).  Mission evaluations may be conducted in the live/virtual/constructive environment while the examinee supervises a  weapons  team  and  controls  Counterland  missions.    When  possible,  MSN  evaluations   24  AFI13-1CRCV2  16 APRIL 2015 will  replicate  large  force  employment  scenarios  with  supporting  theater  documents (SPINS, ROE, ATO/ACO, etc.), mission packages, and ADA interface, C2EW and HHQ integration  (T-3).    The  evaluation  shall  include  participation  of  at  least  one  or  more external TACS units (T-3).  If a full operations crew is used, an ADA interface should be simulated.    The  evaluation  will  be  conducted  in  a  controlled  radar  and  communications jamming environment; otherwise, radar and communications jamming may be simulated (T-3). 4.1.1.3.  Except  during  an  INIT  QUAL,  there  will  be  instances  where  an  examinee, during  the  mission,  accomplishes  all  areas  required  for  both  the  qualification  and  the mission  evaluation.    In  this  case,  the  evaluation  will  be  annotated  as  a  QUAL/MSN evaluation  (T-3).    Acceptability  of  required  activity  will  be  based  on  the  SEE’s determination  that  all  areas  required  for  a  mission  and  a  qualification  evaluation  have been met (T-3). 4.1.1.4.  The  examinee  must  control  one  Counterair,  one  Counterland,  and  one  Air Refueling  mission  to  complete  the  evaluation  (T-3).    Crew  members,  regardless  of designation  as  combat  mission  ready  (CMR)  or  basic  mission  capable  (BMC)  will complete both QUAL and MSN evaluations (T-3). 4.1.1.4.1.  Counterair missions will be conducted where weapons examinees provide tactical  or  broadcast  control,  with  a  minimum  of  one  intercept,  as  briefed  by  the aircrew (T-3).  The control will be provided to at least two separate fighters/elements simultaneously  committed  against  a  minimum  of  two  targets  (e.g.,  2v2)  (T-3).    The examiner will ensure the weapons examinee participates in all phases of the mission (T-3).    NOTE:    It  is  not  a  requirement  for  this  mission  to  result  in  a  maneuvering dogfight. 4.1.1.4.2.  Air  refueling  evaluations  require  control  be  provided  to  at  least  two separate receivers rendezvousing on one or more tankers.  The weapons examinee is to  demonstrate  a  close  control  rendezvous.    Switch  actions  will  be  used  at  the discretion of the examinee (T-3). 4.1.1.4.3.  Counterland evaluations require the examinee to direct at least one flight of aircraft  conducting  air-to-surface  tactics  against  a  ground  objective.    The  examinee will control the flight from check-in until the prosecution of at least one objective is met  (T-3).    Switch  actions  will  be  used  at  the  discretion  of  the  examinee  (T-3).    A Counterland mission must include the following elements (T-3): 4.1.1.4.3.1.  Airspace  management:    Assigning  altitude  blocks,  and/or  safe deconfliction between aircraft (manned/unmanned) 4.1.1.4.3.2.  Target Area Brief:  Air or ground picture and the objective area 4.1.1.4.3.3.  Dynamic/Deliberate Tasking:  Updated or pre-planned objective 4.1.1.4.3.4.  MISREP:  Mission report 4.1.1.5.  Completion  of  an  SD  or  ISD  evaluation,  which  includes  demonstration  of competence as an AWO, qualifies the SD to perform as an AWO and the ISD to perform as an AWO or IAWO.  An Examiner SD (ESD) may accomplish evaluations on the SD and WD/AWO positions. AFI13-1CRCV2  16 APRIL 2015   25  4.1.1.6.  SDs that were previously  qualified  as  IAWOs may  continue to perform  IAWO duties under the following conditions: 4.1.1.6.1.  The SD must perform IAWO duties on the SD INIT QUAL evaluation and subsequent recurring SD evaluations (T-3). 4.1.1.6.2.

There will be instances where an examinee, during the mission, accomplishes all areas  required  for  both  the  qualification  and  the  mission  evaluation.    In  this  case,  the evaluation  will  be  annotated  as  a  QUAL/MSN  evaluation  (T-3).    Acceptability  of required  activity  will  be  based  on  the  SEE’s  determination  that  all  areas  required  for  a mission and a qualification evaluation have been met (T-3). 5.1.1.4.  The  examinee  must  control  one  Counterair,  one  Counterland,  and  one  Air Refueling  mission  to  complete  the  evaluation  (T-3).    Crew  members,  regardless  of designation as CMR or BMC will complete both QUAL and MSN evaluations (T-3). 5.1.1.4.1.  Counterair missions will be conducted where weapons examinees provide tactical  or  broadcast  control,  with  a  minimum  of  one  intercept,  as  briefed  by  the aircrew (T-3).  The control will be provided to at least two separate fighters/elements simultaneously  committed  against  a  minimum  of  two  targets  (T-3).    The  examiner will  ensure  the  weapons  examinee  participates  in  all  phases  of  the  mission  (T-3).  NOTE:  It is not a requirement for this mission to result in a maneuvering dogfight. 5.1.1.4.2.  Air  refueling  evaluations  require  control  be  provided  to  at  least  two separate receivers rendezvousing on one or more tankers.  The weapons examinee is to  demonstrate  a  close  control  rendezvous.    Switch  actions  will  be  used  at  the discretion of the examinee (T-3). 5.1.1.4.3.  Counterland evaluations require the examinee to direct at least one flight of aircraft  conducting  air-to-surface  tactics  against  a  ground  objective.    The  examinee will control the flight from check-in to the prosecution of at least one objective is met (T-3).    Switch  actions  will  be  used  at  the  discretion  of  the  examinee  (T-3).

The examinee must demonstrate a degree  of  knowledge  and  proficiency  essential  for  successful  mission  accomplishment, profile  execution,  and  safety  of  flight  (T-3).    When  possible,  MSN  evaluations  should replicate  large  force  employment  scenarios  with  supporting  theater  documents  (SPINS, ROE,  ATO/ACO,  etc.),  mission  packages,  and  C2EW  and  HHQ  integration.    The evaluation should include participation of at least one or more external TACS units and, when possible, conducted with a full operational crew.  When possible the evaluation will be conducted in a controlled radar and communications jamming environment; otherwise, radar and communications jamming may be simulated (T-3). 9.1.1.3.  There will be instances where an examinee, during the mission, accomplished all areas  required  for  both  the  qualification  and  the  mission  evaluations.    In  this  case,  the evaluations  will  be  annotated  as  a  QUAL/MSN  evaluation  (T-3).    Acceptability  of required activity will be based on the evaluator’s determination that all areas required for a mission and a qualification evaluation have been met (T-3). Table 9.1.
