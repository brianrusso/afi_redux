These procedures will address all requirements called for in paragraph 8.8, and those contained within DoDI 6055.01, Enclosure 3. (T-1)  8.8.1.  The DoL may conduct, as part of its evaluation program, annual targeted inspections or program assistance visits of Air Force installations based on the comparative incidence of worker compensation claims. The DoL will prescribe special procedures in the notification process. OSHA representatives may question or privately interview any employee, supervisory employee or official in charge of an operation or workplace. Federal or state OSHA representatives must present identifying credentials and state the purpose of the visit to the installation commander or authorized representative before conducting an inspection of a workplace on an Air Force installation. OSHA may also request installations perform self-investigations and self-inspections on a case-by-case basis. Installation commanders, through execution of a locally approved OSHA Reception and Action Plan developed IAW paragraph 8.3.12, will: (T-1)  8.8.1.1.  Ensure Security Forces are provided a letter of instruction outlining notification procedures to the installation safety office upon OSHA’s arrival at the gate. (T-2) 8.8.1.2.  Ensure the OSHA representative(s) are met by a member of the installation safety office and escorted to the initial in-brief.

(T-2)  8.8.1.3.  Host an initial in-brief with DoL and State OSHA representatives. (T-2) The installation safety office will notify their CC/CV, JA and IG of OSHA’s arrival. (T-2) Notify Bioenvironmental Engineering, Fire Emergency Services, Public Health, Civilian Personnel Office, Contracting Office, tenant unit safety offices and others as needed of the in-brief meeting details. (T-2) Attendance is optional for IG, Contracting and Civilian Personnel Office. Bioenvironmental Engineering, Fire Emergency Services, Public Health and tenant unit safety offices will be expected to attend based upon the OSHA inspector’s stated purpose of the visit. (T-2)  8.8.1.4.  Provide, upon request, access to available safety, fire protection and health information on workplaces, unless prohibited by this instruction or other AFI guidance. (T-1) Access to privileged safety information is prohibited by DoDI 6055.07 and AFI 91-204.  8.8.1.4.1.  OSHA officials may review non-privileged portions of mishap reports in the workplace during the course of their inspection. Do not release “For Official Use Only”-marked reports or materials to them. OSHA requests for copies of such reports or materials will be IAW AFI 91-204.  8.8.1.4.2.  OSHA officials requesting access to additional information and records may obtain the information IAW the provision of DoDI 6055.01.  8.8.1.6.  Arrange a closing conference with the OSHA official if requested and invite labor representatives to attend. If significant hazards or deficiencies are identified or problems occur during an OSHA inspection or investigation, call the MAJCOM/FOA/DRU safety staff. The MAJCOM/FOA/DRU will in turn immediately notify AFSEC/SEG.  8.8.2.  Treat DoL OSHA notices of violations in the same manner as a fire, safety or health Air Force inspection report. (T-1) Evaluate and assign a RAC to each hazard identified by OSHA personnel. (T-1)   8.8.3.  Ensure appropriate members of the fire, safety, or health offices verify DoL inspection results, including all testing. (T-1) Air Force tests or sampling for future testing should be accomplished at the same time and at the same location as the DoL testing, if possible.  8.8.4.  Ensure DoL personnel conducting the inspection receive a coordinated response as required and prescribed by the OSHA Notice of Violations (NoVs) instructions. (T-1) If an OSHA inspection team visits the installation and it appears there may be possible NoVs, the installation commander’s staff, to include the applicable representative members (e.g. FES, PH, BEE, etc.), should be notified and involved in abatement plan establishment. Although a unit will be cited individually at a particular location, the identified hazard may, in fact, be classified a “Repeat” citation, because a similar finding was previously cited at another Air Force location. This practice is due to OSHA considering the Air Force as an “Enterprise-wide” organization and OSHA treats related workplaces within a corporate family as one workplace for purposes of “Repeat” violations. Therefore, the finding is considered a corporate matter rather than a singular installation matter. With the “Enterprise-wide” applicability of NoVs, all correspondence to OSHA will be coordinated with the appropriate MAJCOM/DRU/FOA (SE, FES, SG) and HAF (AFSEC, AFCEC, AF/SG). (T-1) If required, AFSEC will coordinate with SAF/IEE. The MAJCOM and AFSEC track all violation(s) from identification through proposed response to OSHA and subsequent closure. Upon receiving a NoV, the cited unit will draft and coordinate the proposed official response to the violation, which will then be sent to the applicable MAJCOM/DRU/FOA safety office and AFSEC in parallel. (T-1) The MAJCOM/DRU/FOA will forward their coordinated position to AFSEC via e-mail to afscseg@us.af.mil for review and approval. AFSEC/SEG will determine if SAF/IEE coordination is needed. Once AFSEC/SEG has attained SAF/IEE coordination, as needed, the coordinated and approved response to OSHA will be returned to the installation commander for release to OSHA. Units will need to build this additional coordination process into the time frame allowed for the response suspense to OSHA. (T-1) Requests for an extension from OSHA (to include interim control measures) will be initiated by the installation OSM as the OSHA process manager for the installation commander, with an electronic courtesy copy sent to the MAJCOM/DRU/FOA and AFSEC. (T-1) Provide copies of the inspection report, replies to OSHA, and related correspondence through command channels to the addressees listed in paragraphs 8.8.5.1 – 8.8.5.9. (T-1)  8.8.5.  In addition to local notifications, such as installation IG, JA, PA, CC or CV, and affected organizations or tenant activities, the installation safety office shall notify the agencies in paragraphs 8.8.5.1 – 8.8.5.9 within two duty days of any official OSHA visit to an Air Force installation, to include AF-led Joint Bases. (T-1) This requirement also applies when an installation receives a formal request from OSHA to self-investigate a fire, safety or health matter on OSHA’s behalf. Notification shall include unit(s) or specific area(s) being inspected. (T-1) Upon completion of the OSHA visit, health and fire officials, as applicable, shall coordinate responses to OSHA visits and citations with the safety staff. (T-1) If a NoV is received, the safety staff will transmit a supplemental report on investigation or inspection visits within two workdays after receiving the OSHA violation(s). (T-1) This reporting requirement applies to Air Force workplaces or operations performed by a contractor in which Air Force workplaces, equipment or procedural deficiencies are identified in the citation. Use AFSAS OSHA Event Module to transmit this report. (T-1) Note:  The AFSAS OSHA Event Module is designed to meet the intent of these requirements and will e-mail the agencies listed below to include applicable MAJCOM/FOA/DRU and Intermediate Command agencies. If unable to access AFSAS, reports may be transmitted by e-mail to: afscseg@us.af.mil and the e-mail addresses below.  8.8.5.7.  afcec.cxf.workflow@us.af.mil (AFCEC Fire).  8.8.5.9.  AFCEC.CO@us.af.mil (AFCEC/CO).  8.8.5.10.  Applicable MAJCOM/FOA/DRU/SEG/SGP/SGPB/CE.  8.8.5.11.  Applicable Intermediate Command/SEG/SGP/CE.  8.8.6.  The AFSAS OSHA Event Module requires the following information (Note: Include the same information if using e-mail process): (T-1) 8.8.6.5.  Results of investigation or inspection. If a NoV is received, send a supplemental message with a copy of the violation notice or any notices of unsafe and unhealthful working conditions, along with the RAC assigned and all corrective actions planned or implemented in response to the violation. (T-1)  8.8.6.7.  Deleted.  8.8.6.8.  POC Name, email address, and DSN. (T-1)  8.9.  DoL Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Annual Visit Summary. AFSEC/SEG will use the procedures and information attained through the AFSAS OSHA Events Module to identify trends, enterprise-wide issues and complete the annual report required by the DoL.  8.10.1.  Federal OSHA officials may perform OSH inspections of Air Force contractor workplaces in areas where the US holds exclusive federal jurisdiction. Verify with base legal office/JA to determine which areas of the installation fall under federal jurisdiction. (T-1)  8.10.4.  A notice of a Federal or State OSHA inspection or investigation of contractor operations on an Air Force installation will be reported IAW paragraph 8.8.5 of this instruction. For State OSHA events no additional reporting beyond the initial message is required unless federal activities are impacted.  8.11.1.  Safety and Health Standards Enforcement. IAW Sections 1960.31 and 1960.35, OSHA and NIOSH officials, acting as representatives of the Secretary of Labor, are authorized to conduct announced and unannounced inspections of DoD workplaces except for uniquely military workplaces and operations, and nonmilitary-unique workplaces staffed exclusively by military personnel. DoD Components are authorized to request through the DUSD(I&E) NIOSH hazard evaluations. OSHA inspection procedures for federal agency workplaces are provided in OSHA Directive Number CPL 02-00-160.  8.11.2.  State OSHA officials, operating under a federally-approved plan and subject to the terms of any variance, tolerance, or exemption granted by the DoL, may enforce state OSHA standards in workplaces. Verify with the base legal office/JA to determine which areas of the installation fall under exclusive federal jurisdiction. (T-1)  8.11.4.  When federal or state OSHA officials require entry to a classified or restricted area, the official must meet established security requirements for the area. (T-1)  8.11.5.  DoD agencies are responsible for resolving issues related to violations or requests for delays, variations, tolerances or exemptions of applicable safety and health standards. BY ORDER OF THE  SECRETARY OF THE AIR FORCE AIR FORCE INSTRUCTION 91-202 Incorporating Change 1, 15 February 2017 24 JUNE 2015 Safety THE US AIR FORCE MISHAP PREVENTION PROGRAM COMPLIANCE WITH THIS PUBLICATION IS MANDATORY ACCESSIBILITY:   This publication is available for downloading on the e-Publishing website at: www.e-publishing.af.mil.

Purpose.  The purpose of the Air Force Mishap Prevention Program is to minimize the loss of Air Force (AF) resources and protect Air Force personnel from death, injuries or occupational illnesses by managing risks  on and off-duty. This  program  is  aligned and framed  using the Air Force  Safety  Management  System  (AFSMS)  as  the  core  structure  and  applies  to  all  AF organizations. Safety Management System (SMS) is a systematic approach to managing safety, including the necessary organizational structures, accountabilities, policies and procedures. Note:  While Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s (OSHA) Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) is recognized as a form of a Safety Management System (SMS), and is closely aligned with the AFSMS, units employing VPP will still follow the USAF mishap prevention program guidance contained within this instruction. (T-1) 1.2.  Vision.  The Air Force vision is to be a world leader in safety management and provide care for  our  Airmen  and  our  environment  to  meet  our  air,  space  and  cyberspace  missions. Accordingly, the Air Force is committed to the following three priorities: 1.2.1.  Compliance. Comply with all safety and regulatory guidelines. 1.2.2.  Risk  Reduction.  Protect  our  assets,  personnel  and  material  by  effectively  identifying and managing risks. 1.2.3.  Continuous  Improvement.  Instill  a  culture  that  encourages  and  supports  continuous improvement. 1.3.  Use  of  AFSMS  in  the  Mishap  Prevention  Program.  Mishap  prevention  activities  are assigned to one of the four AFSMS pillars as depicted in Figure 1.1. Commanders at all levels are  responsible  for  developing  and  implementing  a  mishap  prevention  program  utilizing  the AFSMS Pillars. Figure 1.1.  AFSMS Pillars.  10 AFI91-202  24 JUNE 2015 1.3.1.  The purpose of the AFSMS is to utilize the four pillars as depicted in Figure 1.2 as a framework for structuring the AF mishap prevention program and activities used to minimize risk and reduce the occurrence and cost of injuries, illnesses, fatalities and property damage. Managing  mishap  prevention  activities  requires  goal  setting,  planning,  executing  and measuring  performance  utilizing  continuous  improvement  processes  through  the  Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) model as described in paragraph  1.5. 1.3.2.  Leadership  implements  the  mishap  prevention  program  by  providing  guidance  and goals, establishing safety responsibility and accountability, applying risk management to all activities,  and  promoting  the  program  throughout  the  organization.  This  implementation establishes  the  program  designed  to  prevent  mishaps,  safeguard  Airmen,  protect  resources and preserve combat readiness. Figure 1.2.  AFSMS Framework.  1.4.  AFSMS Pillars. 1.4.1.  Policy  and  Leadership.  Safety  policy  provides  the  framework  to  build  a  sound  and proactive mishap prevention program. Active leadership involvement in the implementation and execution of the system supported at all levels of command is critical. The following are descriptions  and  examples  of  safety  policies, leadership  engagement  and  Airmen participation. 1.4.1.1.  Safety  Policy.  Policies  form  the  foundation  of  the  mishap  prevention  program using  the  AFSMS  framework,  providing  expectations  and  requirements  for  integrating AFSMS into the Air Force safety mission, vision, goals and objectives. Air Force safety policy is established through Air Force Policy Directives, and implementation is directed through  Air  Force  Instructions  (AFIs),  Manuals  (AFMANs)  and  Pamphlets  (AFPAMs), defining  the  directives,  policies,  procedures  and  organizational  structures  necessary  to implement the program. AFI91-202  24 JUNE 2015 11 1.4.1.2.  Leaders have overall responsibility for safe operations and must clearly establish safety responsibility and accountability throughout the organization, communicating their commitment  to  the  safety  and  health  of  our  Airmen.  Safety  staffs  at  all  levels  assist commanders  with  the  implementation  and  integration  of  safety  management  elements into all activities. 1.4.1.3.  Leaders  will  set  safety  policies  and  goals,  and  lead  the  mishap  prevention program  SMS  implementation,  communicating  safety  management  throughout  the organization by identifying  and  controlling safety  risk, applying management principles and promoting a strong safety culture. 1.4.1.4.  Leadership engagement examples include, but are not limited to: 1.4.1.4.1.  Commitment and Responsibility. 1.4.1.4.1.1.  Directing  the  organization  to  implement  and  maintain  a  mishap prevention program. 1.4.1.4.1.2.  Providing leadership and assuming overall responsibility. 1.4.1.4.2.  Accountability and Authority. 1.4.1.4.2.1.  Establishing  a  documented  safety  policy  and  ensure  the  policy  is communicated to Airmen. 1.4.1.4.2.2.  Holding  Airmen  at  all  levels  accountable  for  effective  program implementation. 1.4.1.5.  Airmen Participation. Airmen are required to be actively engaged in the mishap prevention program. The organization shall establish and implement processes to ensure effective  participation  by  its  Airmen  at  all  levels.  Proper  use  of  the  AFSMS  elements ensures  Airmen  engagement  enhances  the  systems’  effectiveness  and  drives  continuous improvement. Examples include but are not limited to: 1.4.1.5.1.  Encouraging and supporting Airmen participation in the mishap prevention program. 1.4.1.5.2.  Providing input to safety committees. 1.4.1.5.3.  Conducting safety briefings. 1.4.1.5.4.  Conducting  safety-related  inspections  and  assessments  through  recurring unit-level safety inspections and briefings. 1.4.1.5.5.  Hazard identification and risk assessments. 1.4.1.5.6.  Safety and health-related training. 1.4.1.5.7.  Job Safety Analyses. 1.4.1.5.8.  Utilizing safety feedback mechanisms to communicate unit safety concerns to leadership. 1.4.2.  Risk Management (RM). Risk management is the key to mishap prevention. The Air Force’s  five-step  Deliberate  RM  process  is  the  core  of  the  Air  Force’s  safety  and  mishap prevention  program.  RM  will  be  utilized  to  the  maximum  extent  possible  to  identify  and assess  hazards  from  which  mitigating  controls  are  developed.  (T-1)    Control  measures 12 AFI91-202  24 JUNE 2015 selected  for  implementation  are  then  continuously  monitored  and  analyzed  to  assess  their effectiveness. More details are available in AFI 90-802, Risk Management, and AFPAM 90-803, Risk Management (RM) Guidelines and Tools. Figure 1.3.  The Air Force 5-Step RM Process.  1.4.3.  Assurance.  Safety  assurance  is  the  evaluation,  review  and  monitoring  that  assures commanders  the  elements  of  the  mishap  prevention  program  are  being  implemented,  and guides continuous improvement efforts. Assurance programs measure whether organizations conform  to  standards  and  are  making  progress  toward  established  goals.  Assurance  is enhanced using the following elements: 1.4.3.1.  Evaluation  and  Reporting  Action.  Evaluate  system  conformance  and performance  through  monitoring,  measurements,  mishap  or  near  miss  investigations, inspections,  assessments  and  evaluations.  Corrective  action  must  be  taken  when  non-conformance with system processes or execution of the system is identified. (T-1) 1.4.3.1.1.  Inspection, Assessment and Evaluation Process.  Identify potential hazards and confirm risks during inspections, assessments and evaluations. (T-1) This process focuses  on  compliance  and  conformance  with  the  mishap  prevention  program  and performance results achieved. 1.4.3.1.2.  Safety  assurance  processes  will  concentrate  on  validating,  through collection  and  analysis  of  objective  evidence  and/or  data  (i.e.,  documents,  records, metrics,  inspection,  evaluation),  that  operation,  process,  or  system  expectations continue to be met or exceeded. process/program evaluation, 1.4.3.1.3.  Safety assurance data acquisition will be obtained from numerous sources, including continuous program monitoring/measurement, self-inspection, independent internal (Unit Effectiveness  Inspection  [UEI],  Management  Inspection  [MI],  etc.),  mishap/event investigation and internal  reporting systems  (Hazard Reports, Airman Safety  Action Program  [ASAP]  Reports,  High  Accident  Potential  Reports,  Management  Internal Control  Toolset  [MICT],  etc.).  (T-1)  Ensure  acquired  data  is  actionable  and adequately measures operation, program process and/or system performance. inspection/evaluation external AFI91-202  24 JUNE 2015 13 (T-1) 1.4.3.2.  Monitoring.  Commanders  will  determine  whether  the  system  is  performing effectively  and  meeting  regulatory  requirements  by  monitoring  the  status  of  corrective and  preventive  actions,  injury/illness  metrics,  findings  of  incident  investigations (including  near  misses  and  close  calls),  inspections,  assessments,  audits,  performance measures and trend analysis. (T-2) 1.4.3.2.1.  Sustained  and  Continuous  Improvement  Expectations.  To  be  effective, monitoring  should  ensure  the  necessary  information  is  available  for  leadership  to evaluate  the  continuing  suitability,  adequacy,  and  effectiveness  of  the  mishap prevention program. It should also help commanders set improvement targets. 1.4.3.3.  Leadership  Review  (Program  Management  Review  [PMR]).  The  review  is  for leadership  and  applicable  process  owners  to  conduct  a  strategic  and  tactical  critical evaluation  of  the  conformance  and  performance  of  the  mishap  prevention  program  and AFSMS framework, and to recommend improvements. Results and action items from this review  shall  be  documented,  prioritized,  communicated  to  affected  organizations  and tracked to completion. (T-1) See Attachment 17.  1.4.3.3.1.  Implementation Expectations. After reviews, communicate expectations to each  Airman  and  incorporate  these  expectations  into  actionable  tasks  with  clear deliverables,  and  estimated  completion  dates.  Additionally,  revise  program  and/or system requirements, as needed. 1.4.3.4.  Miscellaneous safety assurance considerations: 1.4.3.4.1.  Design Review and Management of Change. Identify and take appropriate steps to prevent or otherwise control hazards at the design and redesign stages using tools  found  in  the  System  Safety  and  RM  processes.  Commanders,  supervisors  and planners will utilize change management tools to assess and address change-induced risks associated with operations and contingencies. (T-2) 1.4.3.4.2.  Procurement.  Identify  and  evaluate  potential  hazards  prior  to  purchasing products,  goods  and/or  services.  Ensure  procedures  and requirements  are communicated to suppliers and service providers. 1.4.3.4.3.  Contracts.  As  appropriate,  include  safety  processes  in  the  Performance-Based Work Statement (PWS) for contracted work. 1.4.3.4.4.  Emergency  Preparedness.  Periodically  evaluate  plans  IAW  AFI  10-2501, Air Force Emergency Management Program Planning and Operations. 1.4.3.4.5.  Early  Intervention  of  Hazards.  Participate  in  existing  Air  Force  proactive safety programs, such as Air Force Combined Mishap Reduction System (AFCMRS) and  ASAP,  that  provide  early  identification  and  intervention  for  hazards.  Use  such programs to identify, measure and mitigate hazards; revisit existing risk controls; and determine  the  effectiveness  of  newly  implemented  risk  mitigations.  Jointly  use traditional  mishap  investigation  data  sources,  i.e.,  Air  Force  Safety  Automated System (AFSAS), and proactive safety data sources, e.g., Military Flight  Operations Quality Assurance (MFOQA), to measure the risk posed by hazards to operations. 14 AFI91-202  24 JUNE 2015 1.4.3.4.6.  Consultation. Safety professionals provide consultation services in regards to all aspects of safety. This includes by request, through assurance processes and/or any other opportunities. 1.4.4.  Promotion,  Training  and  Education.  Ensure  Airmen  are  provided  safety  awareness information,  organizations  have  embedded  ongoing  training  into  the  mishap  prevention program, and organizations have implemented effective risk control measures. (T-1) 1.4.4.1.  Training  and  Competence.  AF  personnel  (military,  civilian)  and  advisory  and assistance  services  contractors  shall  know  the  mishap  prevention  program  requirements that  apply  to  their  daily  duties.  Records  of  training  are  generated  and  maintained  as directed by this instruction and other guidance. 1.4.4.2.  Communications  and  Awareness.  AF  personnel  shall  understand  practices regarding  possible  hazard  identification,  control  and  reporting  procedures.  (T-0) Additionally, they shall understand where and how they can practically participate in the mishap prevention program. (T-0) 1.4.4.3.  Safety  Culture.  The  ideal  safety  context  for  maximizing  mishap  reduction through  the  AFSMS  should  be  defined  as  an  Informed  Culture;  comprised  of  a  Just Culture,  Reporting  Culture,  Learning  Culture  and  Flexible  Culture,  as  described  in  the elements of this section. 1.4.4.3.1.  The foundation of an Informed Culture is a Just Culture, which encourages personnel  to  provide  safety-related  information  without  fear  of  reprisal.  A  Just Culture  should  be  continuously  promoted  and  reinforced  through  leadership  actions throughout  organizations  by  encouraging  members  to  address  hazards  and  mitigate risk without fear of adverse actions. Commanders must encourage reporting for safety analysis  and  mishap  prevention  purposes,  while  establishing  clear  guidelines  on acceptable  and  unacceptable  behavior.  In  a  Just  Culture,  the  immediate  response  by personnel  who  become  aware  of  a  hazard  should  be  to  find  “what  happened  and why,” versus “who to blame and punish.” Leaders in a Just Culture should understand and promote the notion that more can be learned through full reporting and detailed investigation  than  blame  and  punishment.  A  Just  Culture  fosters  partnerships  for identifying  hazards  and  the  root  causes  of  events  where  safety  was  diminished.  All personnel must clearly understand and recognize that it is unacceptable to punish all errors and unsafe acts regardless of their origins and circumstances while it is equally unacceptable to give blanket immunity from sanctions to all actions that could, or did, contribute to diminished safety. Commanders may not use safety investigation reports for any purpose except mishap prevention, but other investigations may be used as a basis for command disciplinary action, as appropriate. 1.4.4.3.2.  As  the  second  component  of  an  Informed  Culture,  a  Reporting  Culture should  be  continuously  promoted  and  reinforced  by  leadership  actions  throughout organizations by understanding the importance of voluntary reporting of safety threats and errors in ensuring the persistent capability of airpower. 1.4.4.3.3.  As the third component of an Informed Culture, a Learning Culture should be  continuously  promoted  and  reinforced  by throughout leadership  actions AFI91-202  24 JUNE 2015 15 organizations by showing a willingness to change procedures and practices based on uncovered hazards and mistakes before a mishap results. 1.4.4.3.4.  As the fourth component of an Informed Culture, a Flexible Culture should be  continuously  promoted  and  reinforced  by throughout organizations  by  empowering  personnel  to  recommend  procedural  and  behavioral changes to manage risk. leadership  actions 1.4.4.4.  Airmen  Participation.  Airmen  must  be  actively  engaged  in  the  mishap prevention program. (T-1) 1.5.  Continuous  Improvement.  The  AFSMS implements  and  supports  a  continuous improvement process by creating the framework to review safety conformance and performance. It  creates  deliberate  opportunities  to  refine  and  refocus  suboptimal  elements  as  trends  develop, interventions  are  successful  or  fail,  new  technology  is  introduced.  While  Figure  1.2  depicts continuous  improvement  under  the  Assurance  pillar,  there  is,  in  fact,  a  benefit  of  continuous improvement  through  execution  of  the  mishap  prevention  program  using  all  pillars  of  the AFSMS.  Leaders  from  the  squadron  to  the  headquarters  will  use  the  PDCA  methodology  to ensure that continuous improvement is being accomplished. (T-1) PDCA is an iterative four-step management  method  used  for  the  control  and  continuous  improvement  of  processes  and products. 1.5.1.  Plan.  Establish  the  objectives  and  desired  end  state.  Study  programmatic  shortfalls, emerging  trends  and/or  changing  conditions.  Outline  possible  countermeasures  and  the necessary  policy,  programs,  processes  and  actions  necessary  to  deliver  results  IAW  the expected outcome (the target or goals). By establishing output expectations, the completeness and accuracy of the specification becomes a part of the targeted improvement. 1.5.2.  Do.  Implement  the  plan,  execute  the  process  and  make  the  product.  Collect  data  for charting and analysis in the following “CHECK” and “ACT” steps. 1.5.3.  Check. Study the actual results (measured and collected in “DO” above) and compare against the expected results (targets or goals from the “PLAN”) to ascertain any differences. Look  for  deviations  in  implementation  from  the  ”PLAN”  and  “DO”  parts  of  the  cycle  that may  have  affected  execution.  Charting  data  can  make  it  much  easier  to  see  trends  over several  PDCA  cycles  and  convert  the  collected  data  into  information.  Information  is  what you need for the next step “ACT.” 1.5.4.  Act. Request corrective actions on significant differences between actual and planned results.  Analyze  the  differences  to  determine  their  root  causes.  Determine  where  to  apply changes that will include improvement of the process or product. (T-1) At the conclusion of the reviews in  this part of the cycle, there should be evidence of the future direction of the mishap  prevention  program  and  any  needed  changes  to  the  policy,  priorities  objectives, resources or other program elements. 1.6.  Mishap  Prevention  Program  Disciplines  (Aviation,  Occupational,  Weapons,  Space, etc.).  Each  mishap  prevention  program  discipline  will  direct  more  specific  functional management  responsibilities  and  RM  processes  via  AFIs,  standards  and  manuals.  (T-1)  Air Force Host and Tenant safety offices will implement these programs IAW this instruction. (T-1) Any  inter-organization  and  inter-service  agreements  will  be  addressed  in  formal  support documents.  (T-2)  Regardless  of  any  support  agreement  or  executive  agency  guidelines, 16 AFI91-202  24 JUNE 2015 requirements  for  this  instruction  must  be  satisfied.  (T-1)  The  mishap  prevention  program  will address: (T-1) 1.6.1.  Methods to target groups at increased risk for mishaps, injury or illness as directed by the commander, or as indicated through hazard identification processes. 1.6.2.  Processes for tracking and trending hazards, errors and incidents, as well as methods for determining program effectiveness. 1.6.3.  Funding for safety programs. 1.6.4.  Metrics for measuring performance (See examples in Chapter 5). 1.6.5.  Safety goals, objectives and milestones that support Air Force established goals. 1.6.6.  Methods to identify and disseminate safety “best practices,” “benchmarks,” etc. 1.7.  Air  Force  Occupational  Safety  and  Health  (AFOSH)  Guidance  and  Applying Standards.  AFOSH  guidance  must  be  followed  at  all  times  and  is  the  minimum  guidance necessary to provide a safe and healthful work environment for all Airmen and other Department of  Defense  (DoD)/government  personnel  working  on  Air  Force  installations.  (T-0)  Air  Force activities  must  comply  with  OSHA  requirements  at  all  times  unless  the  military-unique exemption applies according to DoDI 6055.01,  DoD Safety and Occupational Health Program. (T-0)  AFOSH  requirements  shall  provide  equal  or  greater  protection  than  applicable  federal regulatory  standards.  (T-0)  All  Air  Force  units  must  comply  with  applicable  safety  guidance during all Air Force operations. (T-1)  The Air Force may develop supplementary or alternative guidance where inadequate or no federal regulatory standards are applicable. MAJCOMs, DRUs and  FOAs  may  supplement  AFOSH  guidance  when  additional  or  more  stringent  safety,  fire prevention  or  health  criteria  are  required.  When  there  is  conflicting  guidance,  apply  that guidance which provides the most protection. Safety offices will maintain (or have access to) a reference library to include national consensus standards and other mission-related technical and safety guidance. (T-2)  1.7.1.  AFOSH guidance sources include: 1.7.1.1.  Regulatory  Federal  Standards.  The  Air  Force  complies  with  applicable Department of Labor (DoL) OSHA , Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Department of Transportation  standards  incorporating  specific  requirements  by  reference  into  AFOSH guidance or technical orders (TOs). 1.7.1.2.  AFOSH  Standards  and  Guidance.  Air  Force  published  guidance  is  located  at http://www.e-publishing.af.mil.  The  Air  Force  publishes  industrial  and  general occupational  safety  guidance  as  Air  Force  instructions,  which  implement  applicable OSHA  standards.  In  some  cases,  AFOSH  guidance  supplements  OSHA  standards  or covers  areas  not  addressed  by  OSHA,  e.g.,  uniquely  military  equipment,  systems  and operations.  Area-specific  instructions  and  technical  data  include  other  safety  criteria. When  AFOSH  guidance  or  safety  criteria  do  not  cover  a  situation,  use  non-Air  Force standards  including  national  consensus  standards,  professional  safety  and  health standards, and other federal agency standards. When there is conflicting guidance, use the guidance that provides the most protection. Refer conflicts between OSHA, AFI, AFOSH guidelines  and  TOs  to  AFSEC/SE  through  the  appropriate  MAJCOM/FOA/DRU  safety office for resolution. (T-0) AFI91-202  24 JUNE 2015 17 1.7.1.3.  TOs  and  manufacturers’  guidance  (e.g.,  Safety  Data  Sheets  [SDS])  for  specific processes, aircraft and equipment. 1.7.1.4.  Reference library maintained by the installation occupational safety manager to include national consensus standards and other technical and safety guidance. 1.7.2.  Joint-Use  Workplaces.  Personnel  from  different  DoD  Components  or  other  federal agencies  working  in  the  same  workplace  shall  be  governed  by  OSHA  standards  and  any applicable agency standards, host/tenant support agreements, joint base instructions, etc. (T-0) 1.7.3.  Military-Unique  Situations.  OSHA  standards  do  not  apply  to  military-unique workplaces, operations, equipment and systems. However, DoD and Air Force policy is that OSHA  standards  shall  apply  when  practicable  and  consistent  with  military  requirements, unless HQ AFSEC or AFMSA/SG3P approves a variance or exemption. 1.7.4.  Variances  and  Exemptions.  The  affected  work  center  shall  process  a  request  for variance  when  it  is  impractical  or  impossible  to  meet  OSHA  standards  or  AFOSH requirements  due  to  operational  needs,  mission  impact  or  technical  reasons.  Variances  are temporary and are normally  granted for periods  not  to  exceed five  years. Exemptions  grant permanent  relief  from  a  requirement  and  may  be  approved  when  the  applicant  can substantiate that their proposed methods, equipment or facilities protect the worker as well or better than the AFOSH requirements or applicable OSHA Standards. AFSEC and Air Force Medical  Support  Agency  (AFMSA)  may  grant  variances  or  exemptions  to  AFOSH  and environmental  requirements,  and  AFI  91-203  guidance  that  are  more  stringent  than applicable  OSHA  requirements.  Neither  AFSEC  nor  AFMSA  has  the  authority  to  grant  a variance  or  exemption  to  an  applicable  OSHA  standard.  Only  OSHA  can  grant  waivers  or exemptions to applicable Title 29 (OSHA) requirements, even if they are included in AFOSH guidance. AFSEC will serve as the liaison between OSHA and the Air Force when seeking OSHA  safety-related  waivers  or  exemptions.  Note:    A  unit’s  inability  to  fund  corrective actions does not constitute sufficient justification to request a waiver, variance or exemption. Request  extensions  for  variances  through  MAJCOM/FOA/DRUs  to  HQ  AFSEC/SEG  or AFMSA/SG3/5, as applicable and appropriate. (T-0) 1.7.4.1.  Variance/Exemption Process. 1.7.4.1.1.  Affected  workcenter  personnel  shall  implement  interim  control  measures and notify the installation occupational safety (or tenant unit safety, if applicable), fire or  health  officials  to  validate  the  effectiveness  of  interim  controls.

They may  reside as a host or tenant  unit function on an installation. Individuals assigned to these positions, or those similar in nature, fulfill the role and responsibility of keeping their respective Commanders/Directors informed of  safety  issues  and  executing  the  mishap  prevention  program  for  their  Commander.  Since their  duties  and  responsibilities  are  those  of  the  senior  safety  advisor  within  their organization, they will report to their Commander/Director as they manage the commander’s mishap prevention program. This is consistent with the principles set forth in AFI 38-101, Air Force Organization. 2.2.  Unit  Safety  Representative  (USR).  Each  unit  will  have  a  primary  and  alternate  USR, Additional  Duty  Weapons  Safety  Representative  (ADWSR)  and  SAFSO,  as  applicable.  When possible,  these  individuals  will  have  one-year  retainability  in  the  assigned  additional  duty position.  Each  installation  safety  discipline  or  assigned  safety  staff  (if  different  than  the installation  safety  office)  will  train  their  respective  USRs  within  30  working  days  after appointment.  Air  Reserve  Component  primary  and  alternate  USR  will  complete  initial  training within two unit training assemblies of appointment. Note:  Units with fulltime safety personnel are not required to have a USR. (T-3)  2.2.1.  Organizations  may  augment  the  primary  and  alternate  safety  representatives  using  a “team  concept”  by  adding  representatives  at  the  flight  level  (or  equivalent  organizational levels). However, the primary and alternate representation will serve as the primary points of contact  for  all  unit  safety  issues.  If  the  team  concept  is  used,  each  member,  beyond  the primary and alternate, will be trained by the organization for their responsibilities. (T-3) 2.2.2.  For specific USR responsibilities, see the discipline-specific chapters. USRs will, as a minimum: (T-3) 2.2.2.1.  Advise the commander on safety matters. 2.2.2.2.

In accordance with AFI 90-801, the Air Force utilizes the ESOHC to achieve ESOH goals throughout the Air Force and  to  provide  senior  leadership  involvement  and  direction  at  all  levels  of  command.  This interdisciplinary approach includes aviation, occupational, weapons and space safety. 2.6.1.  AFI  90-801  governs  the  rules  regarding  the  conduct  of  Environment,  Safety,  and Occupational  Health  Councils.  The  ESOHC  reviews  policies  and  programs,  establishes goals,  monitors  progress  and  advises  leadership.  IAW  AFI  90-801,  the  ESOHC  Chair  may charter an ESOHC Safety Sub-Group to ensure full review and oversight of all safety related matters. (T-2) 2.6.1.1.  If  established,  Safety  Sub-Groups  will  be  chaired  by  the  commander  or commander’s designee and will convene at the commander’s discretion. The Safety Sub-Group  will  be  represented  at  a  minimum  by  group  and  squadron  commanders  from  the host  base,  representatives  from  each  2-letter  office  and  commanders  (or  their  designee) from  tenant  organizations.  Union  representatives  will  be  invited  and  encouraged  to participate. (T-3) 2.6.1.2.  The  safety  staff  will  make  all  Safety  Sub-Group  arrangements;  develop  the agenda and distribute it in advance; and record and publish council meeting minutes. The Safety Sub-Group agenda and minutes will consider safety-related items addressed in the previous ESOHC and the meeting outcomes will be added to the agenda and proceedings of the following ESOHC. The chief of safety will ensure the minutes are prepared within 30  days  following  a  Safety  Sub-Group  meeting.  The  Sub-Group  chair  will  approve  the minutes and all Sub-Group members will be furnished a copy. OPRs will be identified for items requiring action. (T-3) 2.6.2.  Attachment 2 of AFI 90-801 identifies topics that can be addressed, as appropriate, at the  ESOH  Council.  Hazard  report  analysis  will  include  AF  Form  457,  AFSAS-generated Hazard reports, as well as Hazardous Air Traffic Reports (HATRs). Units may address flight safety BASH, HATR and MACA issues through the Airfield Operations Board meetings. 2.7.  Non-USAF  Councils  and  Committees.  The  Air  Force  supports  federal,  state,  and  local safety councils and committees and encourages safety staffs to take part in them. 2.8.  Major  Range  and  Test  Facility  Base  (MRTFB)  Safety  Programs.  MAJCOMs  will establish safety policy for MRTFB and other range activities. The overall goal of the range safety program is to ensure safety consistent with operational requirements, which includes preventing test  objects,  space  launch  vehicles  or  their  hazardous  effects  from  violating  established  limits. Units  operating  any  range  facility  or  conducting  “range  activities”  as  defined  by  AFI  13-212, 52 AFI91-202  24 JUNE 2015 Range Planning and Operations, shall establish a range safety program  to ensure public safety and  protection  of  government  resources  and  personnel.  The  installation  commander  of  the  unit operating the range is considered the Range Operating Authority (ROA). Under the direction of the MAJCOM concerned, the ROA will: 2.8.1.  Appoint a Range Safety Officer (RSO). RSOs appointed to the ROA typically monitor daily  activity  and  implement  the  safety  program.  Range  safety  duties  vary  from installation0level  program  management  (RSO  assigned  to  the  installation/wing)  to  on-site safety  oversight  performed  by  the  RSO,  Range  Control  Officer  (RCO)  or  activity  manager during execution. 2.8.2.  Institute a RM program that quantifies risk and sets requirements for risk acceptance. High residual risk range events are typically accepted by the installation commander or ROA. MAJCOM/A3  and  SE  will  establish  guidance  regarding  high  risk  activities.  Approval authorities in coordination with the installation safety office may issue local OIs for select or repetitious activities. (T-2) 2.8.3.  Determine safety requirements and ensure all range users are in compliance. (T-2) 2.8.4.  Establish allowable ground and flight safety conditions and take appropriate action to ensure that test articles do not violate the conditions. Where reliability of the test object is not established, appropriate measures should be taken to ensure it will not endanger the public or their property. (T-1) 2.8.5.  Ensure weapon safety  footprints  exist for  all aircraft, weapons and tactics  (including those from other services and countries) authorized for a given target and event on the range. Otherwise, employment is restricted IAW AFI 13-212. (T-1) 2.8.6.  The installation safety office assists the ROA with the development and publication of a standardized safety and RM program. An installation-level RSO may be appointed within the safety office. AFI91-202  24 JUNE 2015 53 Chapter 3 SAFETY ASSURANCE 3.1.  General.  Under the AFSMS, safety  assurance is  largely  achieved through safety program evaluations,  assessments  and  inspections  that  measure  program  conformance,  performance  and effectiveness of DoL, DoD and AFOSH requirements. See Table 3.1 for a summary of minimum evaluation, assessment and inspection requirements. Table 3.1.  Safety Evaluations, Assessments and Inspections. Level  Frequency   Type  By Note  MAJCOM/DRU/FOA  36 Months   Safety Evaluation  AFSEC NAF/Center/Wing  24 Months   Safety Program Squadron, Standalone Group 24/12 Months  Wing and below  Monthly  Evaluation  Program Assessment & Safety Inspection  Spot  Wing and below  Monthly  High Interest  Wing and below  Varies  Special and Seasonal MAJCOM/DRU/FOA Wing/Group SE Wing/Group/Squadron SE/Safety Representative/ Supervisor Wing/Group SE Wing/Group SE  1 2    Note 1:  Conducted IAW this instruction and AFI 90-201, as applicable. MAJCOM/SEs will work with their IGs to ensure safety programs receive an external verification/ validation conducted by qualified IG safety inspectors or MAJCOM safety staff. (T-1) These Program Evaluations will be conducted for wing, wing-equivalent or higher with an assigned safety staff. (T-1)  Note 2:  Program Assessments are specified at a 24-month frequency, while safety inspections are at a 12-month frequency. Annual safety program assessments and inspections should be combined when conducted the same year to reduce the footprint within the affected organization.  Note 3: Deleted.  Note 4: Deleted.

Safety  Evaluations.  HQ  AFSEC  will  conduct  Safety  Evaluations  of  MAJCOM Headquarters Staffs at intervals not to exceed 36 months. These evaluations are conducted IAW DoDI, OSHA Standards and federal law. At the direction of AF/SE they will be rated with a two-tier (Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory) grading criteria. 3.2.1.  Safety  evaluations  evaluate  MAJCOM/SE  program  management  compliance  and oversight  of  subordinate  organizations’  safety  programs.  The  evaluation  provides  the MAJCOM/CC/CV  an  independent  perspective  of  the  effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  the evaluated organization’s safety program. 3.2.2.  A written report will be prepared for each evaluation and sent to the commander and the  safety  staff  of  the  MAJCOM  being  evaluated.  This  report  will  contain  a  statement  to declare  the  mishap  prevention  program  conformance  and  performance  under  the  systemic processes of the AFSMS was either Satisfactory or Unsatisfactory. 3.3.  Safety  Program  Evaluation  (SPE).  Either  independently,  or  in  conjunction  with  a  UEI, qualified  safety  personnel  from  MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs  must  evaluate  the  safety  program  of each  organization  at  wing  (or  wing-equivalent  level),  as  appropriate,  and  higher.  (T-1)  During the IG-led inspection, inspectors will sample areas where there is the most risk to mission. (T-1) Safety  staffs  will  develop  evaluation  checklists  to  assess  compliance  and  performance  of  core program elements. (T-1) Safety staffs-developed checklists will be reviewed at least annually for accuracy and relevancy. (T-1) The SPE checklist items include, but are not limited to the APMR, trends in  MICT, mishap trends, results of OSHA inspections, local  training of safety personnel during program evaluations, to include OJT master training plan for assigned 1S0s, and results of any commander-requested safety staff assistance visits that were conducted since the last safety program evaluation. Ensure all items marked as “mandatory” in Attachment 3 of AFI 90-201 are evaluated  during  SPEs.  (T-1)  Safety  will  prepare  a  comprehensive  report  on  the  status  of  the Commander’s  safety  program,  inclusive  of  all  safety  disciplines  evaluated  and  will  attach  this report  as  an  addendum  to  the  IG  report  or  an  independent  report  as  called  for  by MAJCOM/FOA/DRU  procedures.  (T-1)  The  report  will  contain  a  statement  to  declare  the mishap  prevention  program  conformance  and  performance  under  the  systemic  processes  of  the AFSMS  was  either  met  and  effective,  met  but  needs  minor  improvement(s),  met  but  needs significant improvement(s), or was not effective. (T-1)  3.4.  Safety  Program  Assessments.  Qualified  safety  personnel  assess  the  safety  program  of each  standalone  group  and  squadron  on  the  installation  every  24  months  as  a  minimum. AFI91-202  24 JUNE 2015 55 Exception:  For subordinate Geographically Separated Units (GSUs), Detachments or Operating Locations  (OLs),  recommend  on-site  safety  program  management  assessment  be  accomplished at  intervals  not  to  exceed 36 months. MAJCOM/SEs may  allow a virtual  assessment in  lieu of on-site visits. (T-1) 3.4.1.  The  assessment  will  cover  all  applicable  safety  disciplines.  (T-1)    Safety  staffs  will conduct  multi-discipline  (e.g.,  Aviation,  Occupational,  etc.)  assessments  when  feasible. Safety  assessments  address  the  areas  of  commander  and  supervisory  support,  compliance with program directives and the effectiveness of mishap prevention programs (performance). Assessments  may  be  conducted  in  conjunction  with  the  annual  safety  inspection. Assessments may include safety related data found in the Commander’s Inspection Program (CCIP) IAW AFI 90-201. 3.4.2.  The  Safety  Program  Assessment  is  not  an  IG-led  process,  but  is  core  to  the  safety program and authorized in AFI 90-201. Commanders and Chiefs of Safety are encouraged to use information from the CCIP as part of the assessment. Details of the CCIP are in AFI 90-201.  Results  of  the  most  recent  Safety  Program  Assessments  should  be  summarized  and included as part of the APMR. 3.4.3.  Prepare  a  written  report  for  each  assessment.  Send  a  copy  of  the  report  to  the commander  of  the  organization.  The  assessment  report  may  be  combined  with  the  annual inspection report. This report must contain: (T-1) 3.4.3.1.  A  statement  declaring  the  mishap  prevention  program  conformance  and performance  under  the  systemic  processes  of  the  AFSMS  was  either  met  and  effective, met but needs minor improvement(s), met but needs significant improvement(s), or was not effective. 3.4.3.2.  Unit assessed. 3.4.3.3.  Date of assessment. 3.4.3.4.  Management and supervisory support for safety. 3.4.3.5.  Mishap experience and trends. 3.4.3.6.  Compliance with safety program directives. 3.4.3.7.  Description of any program deficiencies or policy shortfalls and references. 3.4.3.8.  Recommendations for improvement/compliance. 3.4.4.  Safety staffs will develop assessment checklists to assess compliance and performance of core program elements. (T-1) Safety office-developed checklists will be reviewed at least annually for accuracy and relevancy, and dated accordingly. (T-1) Conduct assessments with prior  notice.  (T-1)  Related  MICT  self-assessment  communicators  will  be  a  part  of  the composite assessment. (T-1) 3.4.5.  When prescribed by MAJCOM safety guidance, subordinate safety staffs will upload documentation  in  unit  MICT  (or  hyperlink  to  suitable  electronic  medium,  such  as SharePoint®) to permit oversight of assessments by the MAJCOM. (T-3) 56 AFI91-202  24 JUNE 2015 3.4.6.  Follow-up  Procedures  and  Actions.  The  assessed  unit  will  submit  to  the  safety  staff corrective actions taken/planned. (T-1) Safety personnel will track and monitor the status of all open assessment findings until closed. (T-1) 3.5.  Annual  Program  Management  Review  (APMR).  Refer  to  Attachment  17  for  APMR content. The management review provides leadership and applicable process owners a strategic and critical evaluation of the conformance and performance of the Mishap Prevention Program and an opportunity to recommend improvements. Each safety staff at the MAJCOM and below is responsible  for  completing  an  APMR.  (T-1)  The  APMR  will  include  appropriate  data  from  all safety disciplines. (T-1)  Results of the annual APMR inform the commander on the health and effectiveness  of  the  organization’s  safety  program  and  will  contain  a  statement  declaring  the mishap  prevention  program  conformance  and  performance  under  the  systemic  processes  of  the AFSMS  was  either,  met  and  effective,  met  but  needs  minor  improvement(s),  met  but  needs significant improvement(s), or was not effective. (T-1) Results and action items from this review shall  be  documented,  prioritized,  communicated  to  affected  organizations  and  tracked  to completion.  (T-1) The Director/Chief of Safety will brief their commander on the results of the APMR. (T-1) This brief may be conducted during the first ESOHC of the fiscal year. Optimally, it will be briefed in the first quarter of the fiscal year (November or December). Each safety staff conducting an APMR will forward their commander’s endorsed report to  the  next higher level, i.e., NAF/Center, MAJCOM/FOA/DRU, HAF SE office within 10 duty days of the endorsement date. (T-1) 3.6.  Annual  Safety  Inspections.  Safety  inspections  help  identify  hazards  and  measure compliance with applicable safety guidance and standards. Annual inspections may be combined with  the  scheduled  program  assessment  and  CCIP  IAW  AFI  90-201.  The  annual  safety inspection  is  not  an  IG-led  inspection,  but  part  of  core  safety  duties  and  can  only  be accomplished by a qualified safety professional. 3.6.1.  Scope.  At  least  annually  (12  month  cycle),  qualified  safety  personnel  shall  inspect every  installation  workplace/facility  where  Airmen  are  regularly  employed  at  fixed installations.  Inspections  are  to  be  conducted  more  frequently  based  on  factors  such  as  the exposure  to  and  potential  severity  of  hazards,  actual  accident  experience,  special  emphasis programs, changes in the organization’s staffing or workplaces or other events that increase risk  in  the  workplace.  Procedures  shall  be  established  to  document  and  follow-up  on  the correction  of  hazards/deficiencies  identified  during  inspections  every  30  days  (see  spot inspection follow-up and/or hazard abatement program). Note:  Chiefs of Safety may extend the hazards/deficiencies 30 day follow-ups, not to exceed 90 days. Conduct inspections of all workplaces  and  operations  where  Airmen  are  regularly  employed  at  fixed  installations. Inspections  of  workplaces  and  operations  in  contractor  facilities  (Government-Owned Contractor  Operated  (GOCO)  or  contractor  owned/operated)  where  fewer  than  25  Airmen are employed shall be at the discretion of the Chief of Safety, based on existing conditions and  potential  risks.  Assist  the  contract  management  multi-functional  team,  upon  request,  to resolve any issues related to the safety of the contractor’s facilities. (T-0) 3.6.1.1.  Facility, workplace and operational inspections. The safety manager will ensure safety  personnel  are  properly  qualified  and/or  have  been  task  certified  to  perform  all aspects of the inspection, and all facilities assigned to the unit are inspected/documented. The  inspection  report  will  identify  all  workplaces  and  facilities  inspected  regardless  of whether there were findings or not. (T-0)  AFI91-202  24 JUNE 2015 57 3.6.1.2.  All hazards identified during the inspections will be assigned a RAC. (T-1) The safety staff conducting the inspection will assist the responsible supervisor in developing hazard  mitigation  and  abatement  actions.  (T-1)  Program  management  deficiencies identified  during  the  inspections  will  be  assigned  a  deficiency  designator  of  Critical, Significant  or  Minor.  (T-1)  Both  hazards  and  deficiencies  will  be  recorded  and  tracked through closure. (T-1) 3.6.1.2.1.  Critical deficiencies are any validated deficiencies that results in, or could result in, widespread negative mission impact or failure. 3.6.1.2.2.  Significant  deficiencies are validated  deficiencies that have or could  have negative mission impact. 3.6.1.2.3.  Minor  deficiencies  are  validated  deficiencies  that  do  not  meet  the definition of a Critical or Significant deficiency, but requires corrective action. 3.6.1.3.  Checklists  will  be  used  to  help  identify  hazards,  deficiencies  and  other  work-related  violations.  (T-1)  Checklists  located  in  AFI  91-203  may  be  used  to  meet  this requirement.  Create  supplemental  checklists  as  needed  to  address  requirements  not covered in  AFI 91-203.  (T-1)  The safety staff will  ensure checklists are available to  all applicable  organizations.  (T-1)  Safety  office-developed  checklists  will  be  reviewed  at least annually for accuracy and relevancy. (T-1) Method of documentation of the review is determined by the safety staff. 3.6.1.4.  The  host  safety  staff  inspects  units  that  do  not  have  an  authorized  full-time safety position in a particular discipline. Exception:  The host safety staff inspects HAF, MAJCOM,  NAF  and  AFOTEC  safety  offices  as  specified  in  paragraph    1.8.16.5. Host/tenant/associate support agreements will define who will conduct inspections. 3.6.1.5.  GSUs with full-time safety personnel will inspect workplaces annually and keep a  copy  of  report  on  file  until  the  next  annual  inspection.  For  GSUs  without  a  full-time safety  staff,  the  host  base  safety  office  conducts  the  annual  workplace’s  inspection (unless  a  support  agreement  specifies  otherwise)  and  forwards  a  copy  of  report  to  the GSU and the GSU's parent organization. (T-1)  3.6.1.6.  Tenant/Associate  units  with  a  full-time  safety  staff  (by  discipline)  will  conduct annual inspections except as exempted in paragraph  1.8.16.5. (T-1)  3.6.1.7.  Inspect at least 20 percent of unmanned missile and space launch facilities once a  year.  Select  these  launch  work  areas  to  ensure  that  a  representative  segment  of  the unit’s  assets  are  inspected  annually.  Inspections  must  be  scheduled  to  ensure  all  launch work areas will be inspected over a 5-year cycle. (T-1)  3.6.2.  Procedures.  Safety  staffs  will  conduct  multi-discipline  (e.g.  Aviation,  Occupational, etc.)  inspections  when  feasible.  The  safety  staff  will  develop  and  publish  an  annual  fiscal year inspection schedule and distribute to units no later than 15 September for the upcoming fiscal  year.  (T-1)  A  copy  shall  also  be  provided  to  union(s),  as  applicable.  Coordinate assessments and inspections with  the Wing/IG  gatekeeper.  (T-1)  When possible, these may be conducted as part of the Wing’s Commander’s Inspection Program (CCIP). 3.6.2.1.  Inspectors  must  consult  with  workplace  personnel  and their  union representatives on matters affecting their safety and health and give them the opportunity 58 AFI91-202  24 JUNE 2015 to  identify  unsafe  and  unhealthy  working  conditions,  equipment  and  practices.  Conduct such  consultations  privately  and  do  not  identify  employees  who  want  to  remain anonymous. (T-0)  3.6.2.2.  Provide  an  out-brief  to  the  commander  within  three  duty  days  and  a  formal written report to the squadron/unit commander within 15 calendar days after completion of inspection. When either of these timeframes cannot be met, the safety staff will create a memorandum for record justifying the delay. Ensure these reports along with the unit's corrective  actions  are  staffed  through  the  installation  commander  as  their  policy prescribes. When the host base safety office conducts inspections of tenant units, the host base  safety  office  will  send  a  copy  of  the  report  to  the  parent  safety  office.  Formal inspection reports must contain: (T-1) 3.6.2.2.1.  The unit, activity or work areas inspected. 3.6.2.2.2.  The date of the inspection. 3.6.2.2.3.  Facilities and/or work areas inspected. 3.6.2.2.4.  Description of any hazards, deficiencies or unsafe work practices with risk assessment and deficiency codes (as applicable) and references. 3.6.2.2.5.  Causes of deficiencies and hazards noted, if known. 3.6.2.2.6.  Recommendations for improvement/compliance. 3.6.2.2.7.  Instructions  for  follow-up  actions  such  as  requiring  units  to  provide monthly updates on open items until closure. 3.6.2.3.  Follow-up  procedures  and  actions.  The  inspected  unit  will  submit  to  the  safety staff corrective actions taken. (T-1) Safety personnel will track and monitor the status of all  open  inspection  findings  until  closed.  (T-1)  Use  spot  inspections  and  follow-up reporting to ensure corrective action(s) are taken and hazards are mitigated/abated. (T-1) All hazards identified during inspections will be IAW Chapter 4. (T-1) 3.6.3.  Annual  Facility/Workplace  Inspection  Report.  In  conjunction  with  the  End  of  Year Annual  Hazard  Abatement  Survey  Report  data  call,  AFSEC/SEG  will  send  a  data  call  for annual facility/workplace inspection report information required to complete the DoD report called for within DoDI 6055.01. This data call will be sent to each MAJCOM/FOA/DRU for subsequent  distribution  to  their  subordinate  safety  offices.  Each  tasked  safety  staff  will compile  and  provide  the  total  number  of  facilities/workplaces  they  are  responsible  for inspecting,  the  total  number  of  facilities/workplaces  inspected  for  the  preceding  fiscal  year and  the  percentage  of  facilities/workplaces  inspected  for  the  preceding  fiscal  year,  to  their MAJCOM/FOA/DRU, who will, in turn, compile the provided data and send the composite product  back  to  AFSEC/SEG  within  the  suspense  date  assigned.  (T-1)  Note:    Refer  to paragraph    3.6.1  of  this  instruction  to  define  the  facilities/workplaces  each  safety  staff  is responsible  for  inspecting.  This  could  include,  but  is  not  limited  to,  electrical  vaults,  pump houses,  hard  stands,  wash  racks,  guard  towers,  etc.  The  local  OSM  will  act  as  the  decision authority for situations where uncertainty exists with regards to facility/workplace inclusion in this data call. (T-1) 3.7.  Spot  Inspections.  Spot  inspections  are  an  effective  way  to  find  and  eliminate  transitory hazards  and  ensure  compliance  with  safety  requirements.  Workcenter/shop  supervisors,  USRs AFI91-202  24 JUNE 2015 59 and safety personnel will perform spot inspections to check the day-to-day safety and health of an  organization,  workcenter,  facility,  etc.  (T-3)  Workcenter/shop  supervisors,  USRs  and ADWSRs  will  conduct  and  document  monthly  spot  inspections.  (T-3)  See  discipline  specific chapters for additional operations and areas that need to be inspected or monitored. 3.7.1.  The  Chief  of  Safety  will  develop  a  spot  inspection  program  for  their  safety  staff  to ensure  coverage  of  on-duty  and  off-duty  activities  that  occur  on,  or  are  controlled  by  the installation. (T-3) 3.7.2.  Documentation of spot inspections by safety staffs will include the following: (T-3) 3.7.2.1.  The organization, unit, activity or work area inspected. 3.7.2.2.  The date and time of the inspection. 3.7.2.3.  The inspector’s name and their organization or office symbol. 3.7.2.4.  A brief description of the areas, equipment or processes/procedures reviewed as well  as  observations  (may  also  include  positive  findings),  hazards  or  unsafe  work practices. When qualified safety personnel identify hazards or deficiencies, assign RACs or deficiency codes, as prescribed by this instruction. 3.7.2.5.  Causes of deficiencies and hazards, as noted. 3.7.2.6.  Recommendations for corrective action. 3.7.2.7.  Name and phone number and/or e-mail address of responsible person. 3.7.2.8.  Ensure  appropriate  follow-up  actions  (every  30  days)  are  conducted  and documented  until  findings  are  closed.  Note:    Chiefs  of  Safety  may  extend  the hazards/deficiencies 30 day follow-ups, not to exceed 90 days. 3.7.3.  Documentation  of  spot  inspections  by  workcenter/shop  supervisors  and  USRs  will include  the  following  as  a  minimum.  (T-3)  Local  safety  staffs  may  prescribe  additional items. 3.7.3.1.  The activity or work area inspected. 3.7.3.2.  The date and time of the inspection. 3.7.3.3.  The name of the person conducting the spot inspection. 3.7.3.4.  A brief description of the area, equipment or process/procedure reviewed as well as  observations  of  hazards,  deficiencies  or  unsafe  work  practices.  The  description  may also include positive findings. 3.7.3.5.  The applicable RAC or deficiency code, if assigned by a qualified fire, safety or health person after contact by the USR or supervisor. 3.7.3.6.  Corrective action taken or planned. Ensure appropriate follow-up actions (every 30 days) are conducted and documented until findings are closed. (T-1) 3.8.  High Interest Areas.  High interest areas are those areas having the greatest risk to life or property, have experienced repeated mishaps or in the judgment of the wing commander and/or safety  office  require  added  monitoring.  While  designation  should  usually  be  based  on  trends, 60 AFI91-202  24 JUNE 2015 analysis  or  command  interest,  they  can  also  be  work  areas  or  operations  that  need  additional attention  or  inspections  because  of  increased  mishap  potential  due  to  the  nature  of  the  work performed,  physical  conditions  or  type  of  materials  handled.  High  interest  areas,  if  identified, will be designated by the Chief of Safety in writing. (T-3) Inspections will be accomplished and documented  at  least  monthly.  (T-1)  Documentation  of  High  Interest  Area  inspections  will  be IAW paragraph  3.7.2. (T-3) 3.9.  Administrative  Areas.  Task-qualified  unit  occupational  safety  representatives  may conduct inspections of administrative work areas (not permissible for entire facility inspections) when  the  safety  staff  determines  the  mishap  potential  is  minimal.  The  applicable  occupational safety  staff  develops  specific  provisions  to  ensure  the  USR  has  sufficient  documented  training and/or experience in the safety hazards of the administrative area to recognize and evaluate those particular hazards and to suggest general abatement procedures, as required by 29 CFR 1960.25. Any  specific  provisions  beyond  what  may  already  be  addressed  in  the  required  USR  training may  be  added  to  that  training  process.  Periodic  over-the-shoulder  assessments  of  these  USR responsibilities will be accomplished and documented. 3.10.  Special  and  Seasonal  Inspections.  Inspections  are  conducted  to  ensure  work  and recreational environments are safe and healthy. 3.10.1.  Special  inspections  include  seasonal,  targeted  mishap  preventive  activities,  special events  and mission readiness  operations/exercises. Special inspections will  be conducted of installation child development centers (CDCs) and playgrounds that are part of real property. (T-2)  Note:    Installation  safety  offices  are  not  obligated  to  perform  home  daycare inspections.  They  will  instead  provide  hazard  recognition  training  to  Force  Support Squadrons CDCs, so they may conduct home daycare inspections. (T-3) 3.10.2.  Seasonal  inspections  will  be  conducted  of  recreational  areas  (e.g.,  sports  fields, swimming pools, camp grounds, and recreational vehicle parks and other recreational areas). FSS will coordinate with the safety staff to jointly conduct pre-season inspections of seasonal areas. (T-3)  3.11.  Staff  Assistance  Visits  (SAV).  The  purpose  of  the  SAV  program  is  to  help  develop solutions,  not  to  inspect  or  evaluate,  and  to  provide  observations  and  recommendations  for improvement. SAVs may be conducted at any level at any time, but only when requested by the commander  who  is  receiving  the  SAV.  Provide  a  written  report  to  the  commander.  Do  not require  replies  unless  an  action  started  during  the  visit  needs  monitoring  by  the  higher headquarters safety staff or requires further staff action above the level of the visited unit. 3.12.  Department  of  Labor  (DoL)  Inspections.  OSHA  officials  may  conduct  inspections  of nonmilitary-unique  workplaces  and  operations  where  Air  Force  civilian  personnel  work (inspections may be unannounced). Refer to Chapter 8 for specific requirements. 3.13.  Contract  Performance  Assessment.  Installation  or  tenant  unit  safety  offices,  as applicable, will assist the MFT in validating that contractors are meeting the safety requirements of  the  contract.  If  the  installation  is  pursuing  VPP  certification,  the  contracting  officer  is responsible for notifying contractors in writing who are performing work on the installation. (T-3) 3.13.1.  The  MFT  will  ensure  contractors  perform  IAW  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the contract.  Discrepancies  will  be  reported  to  the  MFT  via  contracting  officer’s  representative AFI91-202  24 JUNE 2015 61 (COR). Commanders will ensure CORs that are required to monitor safety requirements are trained in the recognition of hazardous conditions/environments, the use of safety and health standards, and in other areas of safety, as necessary. The appropriate safety office will assist commanders  and  CORs  in  specialized  safety  training  requirements  to  ensure  the  COR  is properly trained to provide oversight of the contract. (T-3)  3.13.2.  Airmen  who  note  potential  safety  violation(s)  will  report  the  hazard  to  the  COR. CORs  notify  the  multi-functional  team,  and  initiate  the  appropriate  actions  related  to violations.  Unless  there  is  critical/imminent  danger,  Airmen  should  avoid  reporting  safety violations directly to the contractor, but should immediately report observed violations to the contracting officer or the installation safety office. (T-3) 3.13.3.  Inspection  of  Contractor  Work  Areas  and  GOCO  Work  Areas.  When  Airmen conduct  safety  inspections  in  contractor  work  areas  their  primary  concern  is  the  potential risks  to  Airmen  and  government  property.  Hazardous  conditions  or  violations  of  safety standards  will  be  reported  to  the  contracting  officer,  the  responsible  commander  or  to  the installation  safety  office.    (T-1)  Note:    Inspections  of  workplaces  and  operations  in contractor  installations  where  fewer  than  25  DoD  personnel  are  employed  shall  be  at  the COS’s discretion, based on existing conditions and potential risks. (T-3) 3.13.3.1.  GOCO explosives activities must comply with the applicable portions of DoDI 4145.26,  DoD  Contractor’s  Safety  Requirements  for  Ammunition  and  Explosives,  to assure safety of the activity and the prevention of mishaps. (T-0)  3.13.3.2.  The  requirements  documents  will  specify  compliance  with  appropriate provisions  of  DoD  Manual  6055.9-M,  DoD  Ammunition  and  Explosives  Safety Standards, AFMAN 91-201, and this instruction. (T-0) 62 AFI91-202  24 JUNE 2015 Chapter 4 HAZARD IDENTIFICATION AND REPORTING 4.1.  Hazard Identification.  Mishap prevention depends on personnel identifying, reporting and correcting  hazards  promptly  and  efficiently.  Managers  or  supervisors  will  not  allow  coercion, discrimination or reprisal against an Airman who exercises their right to report hazards. Reports can be submitted anonymously. 4.2.  Reporting  Criteria.  Submit  hazard  reports  unless  personnel  can  take  corrective  action under this instruction or any of these Air Force publications: (T-3) 4.2.1.  AFI 11-215, USAF Flight Manuals Program (FMP). 4.2.2.  AFI 51-1101, The Air Force Procurement Fraud Remedies Program. 4.2.3.  AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports. 4.2.4.  TO 00-5-1, Air Force Technical Order System. 4.2.5.  TO 00-35D-54, USAF Deficiency Reporting, Investigation and Resolution. 4.3.  Hazard  Reporting  Procedures.  Commanders  must  ensure  an  AF  Form  457,  USAF Hazard Report (HR), or equivalent product is readily available to all personnel. Readily available is defined as not being under lock and key or only accessible through electronic means when a member  does  not  have  immediate  access  to  a  government  computer.  To  ensure  anonymity  in reporting is preserved, commanders will consider that the form posting AF Forms 457 in readily available  locations,  may  be  submitted  anonymously  when  choosing  the  method  of  making  the form readily available. Recommended locations include, but are not limited to, commonly visited areas such as break rooms, training rooms, debrief rooms and safety bulletin boards, if used. Any person assigned, attached or under contract to the Air Force may report a hazard. A hazard report may be submitted on any event that includes hazards, unsafe procedures, practices or conditions that affects  flight,  ground, weapons, systems  or space safety. Report hazards to  the responsible supervisor or consult local SE office for guidance. This process is not designed for readdressing hazards  that  are  already  being  managed  for  abatement  through  another  process  such  as  a  civil engineering work request, job order, project or mishap investigation. (T-1) 4.3.1.  If  the  hazard  presents  critical/imminent  danger,  the  supervisor  or  individual responsible  for  that  area  will  take  immediate  action  to  mitigate  or  eliminate  the  hazard  to protect personnel or property. (T-0) 4.3.2.  Report hazards that cannot be eliminated immediately to the installation safety office via the AF Form 457, by telephone, e-mail or in person. (T-1) 4.3.3.  The  Chief  of  Safety,  in  consultation  with  his  staff,    will  determine  the  appropriate safety,  fire  or  health  discipline  to  investigate  the  HR.  The  assigned  investigator  will investigate the HR within one (1) duty day for critical/imminent danger situations, and three (3)  duty  days  for  potentially  serious  situations  and  10  duty  days  for  lesser  conditions.  The investigator  discusses  the  HR  with  the  member  who  submitted  the  report  (if  known),  the responsible  supervisor  or  manager  and  other  parties  involved  to  validate  the  hazard  and determine the best interim control and corrective action. (T-3) AFI91-202  24 JUNE 2015 63 4.3.4.  If the hazard is validated: 4.3.4.1.  The  investigator  assigns  a  HR  control  number,  a  RAC  as  appropriate  and monitors all corrective actions until complete. (T-1) 4.3.4.2.  The  investigator  completes  the  HR’s  Part  II,  “Summary  of  Investigation,”  and sends  it  promptly  to  the  individual  responsible  for  making  sure  corrective  action  is completed and the hazard eliminated or controlled. (T-1) 4.3.4.3.  The responsible individual completes Part II, “Action Taken,” within 10 working days and returns the HR to the safety office for monitoring. (T-1) 4.3.4.4.  The investigator informs the originator (if known) in writing about the corrective action  or  plans  and  conducts  follow-up  reviews  until  the  action  is  completed.  The investigator  informs  the  originator,  (if  known),  about  the  completed  action  within  10 workdays after the report is closed. If the originator is not known, inform the supervisor or manager of corrective actions. (T-1) 4.3.4.5.  If  the  HR  response  is  not  satisfactory  to  the  originator,  the  originator  should resubmit the report and follow procedures in paragraph  4.5.  4.3.4.6.  HRs that result in an assignment of a RAC may be closed and corrective action monitored  through  the  hazard  abatement  process.  Note:    Transference  of  tracking  from the  hazard  reporting  program  to  that  hazard  abatement  program  does  not  relieve  the investigator or the responsibilities called for in paragraph  4.3.4.4. 4.4.  Additional Reporting Procedures.  Transient personnel unable to report a hazard at a base where  it  is  found  should  submit  the  HR  to  the  next  Air  Force  base  they  visit,  or  to  the  safety office  at  their  home  base.  The  receiving  safety  office  will  send  the  report  to  the  responsible installation safety office. (T-1) 4.4.1.  The safety office sends reports on hazards that cannot be corrected at the local level to the agencies that can take appropriate action. (T-1) 4.4.2.  Tenant  personnel  send  hazard  reports  involving  activities  for  which  the  host  is responsible to the host base safety office for processing. (T-1) 4.4.3.  Hazard  reports  requiring  urgent  action  should  be the  most expeditionary  communication  means  available  (overnight  mail,  official  government  e-mail, telephone). (T-3) transmitted  by 4.4.4.  Persons identifying hazards involving weather forecasting must submit hazard reports as soon as possible to ensure that records are not destroyed. Promptly advise the appropriate agency  providing  weather  forecasting  services,  i.e.,  installation  weather  flight/detachment supporting  operational  weather  squadron,  of  their  intention  to  submit  a  hazard  report. Aircrews should consider using a Hazardous Air Traffic Report. (T-3) 4.4.5.  Installation  safety  staffs  send  hazard  reports  that  involve  other  military  services, foreign nations or other agencies outside the Air Force to HQ AFSEC/SE, 9700 G Ave SE, Kirtland  AFB,  NM  87117-5670,  and  to  the  affected  Air  Force  units  and  their  chain  of command  as  information  addressees.  Upon  receipt,  AFSEC  will  maintain  tracking  and subsequent  closing  action  of  the  report  and  will  report  results  to  both  the  sending  and affected unit. (T-1) 64 AFI91-202  24 JUNE 2015 4.5.  Airmen  Appeal  Procedures.  If  an  Airman  is  dissatisfied  with  actions  taken  on  a  hazard report, he or she should resubmit the report to the appropriate installation safety, fire protection or  BE  office,  and  request  the  alleged  hazard  be  reinvestigated.  Reports  can  be  submitted anonymously. The safety, fire and/or health representative must respond within 10 duty days. If the  Airman  is  still  dissatisfied,  they  may  appeal  to  a  higher  level  of  safety,  fire  protection  or health office in the following sequence: (T-0) 4.5.1.  Intermediate headquarters. 4.5.2.  MAJCOM headquarters. 4.5.3.  AFSEC/SEG (safety hazards), AFCEC/CEXF (fire hazards), or AFMSA/SG3 (health hazards). 4.5.4.  SAF/IE,  Assistant  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  for  Installations,  Environment  and Logistics. 4.5.5.  Deputy  Under  Secretary  of  Defense  for  Environmental  Security.  This  is  the  final review for reports that originate at installations in foreign countries, from military personnel or involve military-unique operations or equipment. 4.5.6.  Higher  level  appeals  must  be  addressed  promptly  and  a  reply  sent  to  the  employee within 20 calendar days. If a reply is not received within 20 calendar days or if the employee is  dissatisfied  with  the  reply,  they  may  appeal  to  the  next  higher  level.  Each  reply  to  an appeal will advise the employee of this right and will include the office symbol and address of  the  next  higher  level  of  appeal.  If  requested,  the  appropriate  agency  will  assist  the employee in obtaining technical information for clarification or for processing the appeal. (T-3) 4.5.7.  Civilian  employees  may  submit  appeals  directly  to  the  Office  of  Federal  Agency Safety Programs, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, US Department of Labor. However,  the  procedures  outlined  in  the  paragraphs  above  are  encouraged  as  the  most expeditious means of correcting hazardous conditions. 4.5.8.  The  procedures  outlined  above  do  not  prevent  the  use  of  agency  or  negotiated grievance procedures. 4.6.  Risk Reduction and Mitigation.  Commanders and supervisors at all levels are expected to determine  the  level  of  acceptable  risk  required  to  preserve  assets  and  safeguard  health  and welfare. They should incorporate RM into daily  activities, on duty  and off duty,  IAW  AFI  90-802. These principles are: (T-1) 4.6.1.  Accept no unnecessary risk. 4.6.2.  Make risk decisions at the appropriate level. 4.6.3.  Integrate RM into operations, activities and planning at all levels. 4.6.4.  Apply the process cyclically and continuously. 4.7.  Preparation  of  Risk  Assessments.  A  formal  risk  assessment  succinctly  documents  the results of the Deliberate 5-Step RM process and supports follow-on decision-making processes. Decision options typically involve determining whether one or more particular courses of action should  be  pursued  (e.g.,  implementing  equipment  improvements,  safety  or  warning  device AFI91-202  24 JUNE 2015 65 improvements,  operational  improvements,  technical  improvements,  policy  improvements),  or whether  a  risk  should  be  accepted.  A  risk  assessment  supports  decision-making  processes  by objectively identifying a hazard, assessing its risk, thoroughly analyzing potential options for risk mitigation and making  a recommendation.  Note:    The term  “losses”  also  include fatalities, not just  system  losses.  Refer  to  AFI  90-802  and  AFPAM  90-803,  Attachment  8,  for  additional guidance regarding the preparation of formal risk assessments and the use of the AF Form 4437, Deliberate Risk Assessment Worksheet, to assist in documenting formal risk assessments. 66 AFI91-202  24 JUNE 2015 Chapter 5 INFORMATION AND DATA ANALYSIS 5.1.  Information Protection.  Safety investigation reports contain privileged safety information and are for mishap prevention purposes only; they are not releasable outside of safety channels. Portions  of  such  reports,  though,  contain  factual,  non-privileged  information,  which  may  be released  to  the  public,  as  well  as  information  that  is  not  releasable  to  the  public.  For  example, information  that  is  for  official  use  only  (FOUO),  may  be  restricted  from  public  release  by  the Freedom  of  Information  Act  (FOIA)  (Title  5,  U.S.C.,  Section  552),  the  Privacy  Act  (Title  5, U.S.C.,  Section  552a),  Health  Insurance  Portability  and  Accountability  Act  (HIPAA)  (Public Law  104-19,  21  August  1996),  Arms  Export  Control  Act  (Title  22,  U.S.C.,  Sections  2751  et seq.), Export Administration Act of 1979 (Title 50, U.S.C., Appendix Sections 2401 et seq.), and other  pertinent  laws,  regulations  and  policies.  For  requests  for  release  of  non-privileged information  in  safety  reports  or  databases,  AFSEC/JA  is  the  release  authority  for  requests  for release  outside  of  the  AF;  AFSEC  personnel  or  the  installation  chief  of  safety  is  the  release authority for requests from AF organizations. (T-0) 5.2.  Safety Information. 5.2.1.  Forward  reports  of  Air  Force  mishaps  as  directed  by  AFI  91-204.  Some  of  these reports may contain recommendations requiring urgent action requirements by AF agencies. Treat these mishap reports as urgent action notices. 5.2.2.  Urgent action notices will be forwarded to HQ AFSEC through the Air Force Service Watch Center (AFSWC) at DSN 227-6103 or AFWatch@Pentagon.af.mil. HQ AFSEC will distribute  these  notices  to  safety  offices  through  electronic  distribution  as  appropriate  to organizations with applicable guidance/instructions. 5.3.  Recurring Publications.  The goal of these publications is to prevent mishaps By providing educational  information  and  insights.  These  publications  discuss  topics  like  standards implementation as well as establishment/maintenance of nuclear surety, environment, safety and occupational  health  programs.  The  OPR  for  each  publication  will  determine  content  and frequency. HQ AFSEC/SEF posts monthly Blue Four News on the Air Force Safety Automated System  (AFSAS)  website,  summarizing  the  previous  month's  Class  A  and  B  aviation  mishaps. This summary contains privileged information and will be protected IAW AFI 91-204, Chapter 3. 5.3.1.  HQ  AFSEC/SE  will  issue  recurring  publications  pertaining  to  the  Air  Force  mishap prevention program. 5.3.2.  MAJCOM  Publications.  MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs  will  utilize  a  variety  of  media  and mediums to disseminate command-specific safety information to subordinate units. 5.3.3.  Periodic  Summaries.  HQ/AFSEC  sends  periodic  mishap  summaries the MAJCOM/FOA/DRU  safety  staffs.  These  summaries  include  recent  mishap  experience, mishap  statistics,  analyses  of  current  problem  areas  and  proposed  changes  in  safety  policy. These  summaries  will  be  disseminated,  as  appropriate,  to  subordinate  organizations  for mishap prevention purposes. to AFI91-202  24 JUNE 2015 67 5.4.  Methods  of  Information  Distribution.  Select  an  appropriate  distribution  method  by considering  content,  time  available  and  audience.  The  MAJCOM/FOA/DRU  safety  office  will determine  the  appropriate  distribution  methods  for  their  subordinate  organizations.  Suggested methods of distribution are: 5.4.1.  For  privileged  safety  information  (requires  appropriate  screening  of  attendees, marking of materials and reminders of the privileged nature of the information): 5.4.1.1.  Safety meetings. 5.4.1.2.  Supervisor safety briefings. 5.4.2.  For non-privileged safety information: 5.4.2.1.  Safety meetings 5.4.2.2.  Supervisor safety briefings. 5.4.2.3.  Base newspapers and bulletins. 5.4.2.4.  Safety publications. 5.4.2.5.  HQ/AFSEC or MAJCOM/FOA/DRU publications. 5.4.2.6.  Electronic means via e-mail, web page or video. 5.5.  Mishap Analysis Program.  In order to reduce mishaps, Commanders and Chiefs of Safety must  know  the  types  of  mishaps  and  mishap  rates,  and  number  of  mishaps  that  occur  in  their command. Once the type and number are identified, commanders can take risk mitigation actions based on sound mishap analysis. This historical look-back approach should be complemented by a proactive, forward looking mishap prevention plan based on pre-identified hazards that haven’t yet caused a mishap. 5.5.1.  MAJCOM/FOA/DRU and Wing safety staffs will: (T-2) 5.5.1.1.  Conduct  an  annual  analysis  and  develop  specific  actions  to  reverse  adverse trends.  Analysis  should  target  specific  problem  areas  with  recommendations  for commander  approval  and  appropriate  actions.  This  analysis  complements  the  data required in Attachment 17.  5.5.1.2.  Identify  successes  or  problem  areas  and  trends,  measure  safety  program effectiveness and guide prevention actions. (T-2) 5.5.2.  HQ AFSEC will perform an annual Air Force-level trend analysis and publish results. In  addition,  AFSEC  may  conduct  Safety  Analysis  Team  (SAT)  hazard  and  mishap  trend analysis (as described in paragraph  5.8) for MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs, as directed by AF/SE. 5.6.  Mishap  Prevention  Analysis  Methods.  There  are  several  ways  to  approach  analysis  of mishap  data  and  proactive  information  for  mishap  prevention  purposes.  Program  analysis functions are to target, monitor and/or study. 5.6.1.  Target  Approach.  This  approach  is  similar  to  the  study  method  below.  After determining causes of mishaps, recommendations are developed and prioritized based on the frequency and severity. Corrective actions are directed at the activities and mechanisms that result in the greatest number of injuries. 68 AFI91-202  24 JUNE 2015 5.6.2.  Study Approach. This is a detailed examination of a specific problem area through the use of a systematic process. A study should follow a systematic process. It typically follows the  format  of  the  Scientific  Method.  The  researcher  first  drafts  a  problem  statement  that clearly  defines  the  goals  of  the  study.  For  example,  a  suitably  specific  research  question might be “Determine a trend in the frequency of X and identify possible explanations for this trend.”  The  researcher  will  then  conduct  background  research  to  identify  factors  and  data relevant to the problem. Then the researcher must draft an objective statement that describes the problem and limits the study (the hypothesis or purpose). An example is “X is increasing because of Y.” Then the researcher develops a plan on how these factors and data are going to  be  collected,  tabulated,  compared,  plotted  and  analyzed  (methods).  Finally,  the  data  is collected  and  analyzed  and  results  reported  confirming  or  denying  the  hypotheses. Conclusions  and  implications  regarding  application  of  the  results  of  the  study  are  the  most important outcome of the study. (T-3) 5.6.3.  Additional  Analysis  Categories.  In  this  method,  the  safety  staff  selects  categories  of raw  data  and  reviews  them  regularly  in  the  form  of  tabulations  or  rates.  The  object  is  to identify  trends  and  problem  areas.  Selection  of  the  areas  to  be  monitored  depends  on  the available data and the needs of the organization. Mishap reports are a good place to start, but other  areas  should  not  be  overlooked.  Some  other  categories  that  may  be  appropriate  for analysis are: (T-3) 5.6.3.1.  Hazardous Air Traffic Reports. 5.6.3.2.  High Accident Potential Reports. 5.6.3.3.  Deficiency Reports. 5.6.3.4.  Inspection/Evaluation Reports. 5.6.3.5.  Foreign Object Damage (FOD) Reports. 5.6.3.6.  First-Aid Cases. 5.6.3.7.  Maintenance Logs or Reports. 5.6.3.8.  Hazard Reports. 5.6.3.9.  Airman Safety Action Program (ASAP). 5.6.3.10.  Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance (MFOQA) Analyses. 5.6.3.11.  Line Operations Safety Audit (LOSA) Reports. 5.6.3.12.  Air Force Combined Mishap Reduction System (AFCMRS) Surveys. 5.6.3.13.  Organizational Safety Assessments (OSAs). 5.7.  Use  of  Analyzed  Data.  The  purpose  of  analysis  is  to  help  prevent  mishaps  and  present conclusions  drawn  in  a  useful  format  that  can  be  applied  to  prevention  programs.  Once corrective actions are taken, follow-up analysis may be required to determine effectiveness. 5.8.  Safety  Analysis  Team  (SAT)  Process.  The  SAT  process  is  an  AFSEC  Analysis  and Integration Division (AFSEC/SEA) led proactive, data-driven process with the goal of providing commanders  with  unbiased,  rank-ordered  risk  mitigation  strategies  to  assist  in  resource allocation for the preservation of combat capability. AFI91-202  24 JUNE 2015 69 5.8.1.  The  SAT  process  focuses  exclusively  on  SME  analysis  of  mishap  reports, identification  of  “documented”  risk  and  development  of  risk  mitigation  strategies  to  meet these hazards. The process then considers the effectiveness of each of the strategies weighed against  real-world  constraints,  and  through  detailed  mathematical  analysis  provides commanders  with  a  rank-ordered  list  of  qualified  and  quantified  recommendations  for implementation. 5.8.2.  SAT  assessments  can  be  requested  through  the  AFSEC/SEA.  All  requests  are approved by AF/SE. HQ AFSEC/SEA will conduct the study and provide a final report and out-brief to the requesting commander. For additional information contact HQ AFSEC/SEA: DSN 246-1562, Commercial (505) 846-1562. 5.9.  Air  Force  Combined  Mishap  Reduction  System  (AFCMRS).  AFCMRS  provides  any commander  with  an  anonymous,  no-cost,  web-based  safety  culture  survey  designed  for operators,  maintainers,  support  personnel,  medical  personnel  and  headquarters  staff.  There  is also  a  survey  which  addresses  motor  vehicle  safety.  Results  are  available  immediately  upon survey completion and commanders receive a telephonic debrief to explain the data and how to utilize the AFCMRS analytic tools. 5.9.1.  Commanders  may  request  AFCMRS  survey  at  https://www.afcmrs.org/  or  by contacting  the  HQ  AFSEC  Human  Factors  Division  (HQ  AFSEC/SEH):  DSN  264-6097, Commercial (505) 846-6097. 5.9.2.  An  OSA  is  a  customized,  in-depth,  proactive  mishap  prevention  tool  that  aids commanders  in  risk  assessment  and  safety  decision  making.  The  program  focuses  on operations, maintenance and support functions with a direct impact on safety across the entire organization.  The  OSA  team  is  comprised  of  subject  matter  experts  who  survey  and interview  members  of  the  host  organization  in  person  regarding  safety  and  related  topics specifically identified by the requesting commander. 5.9.3.  Commanders  may  request  an  OSA  through  AFSEC/SEH.  If  approved  by  AF/SE, AFSEC/SEH  will  conduct  the  OSA  and  provide  an  immediate  out-brief  to  the  requesting commander.  Contact  AFSEC/SEH:    DSN  263-3513  or  Commercial  505-853-3513,  for information. 5.10.  Military  Flight  Operations  Quality  Assurance  (MFOQA).  The  Air  Force  MFOQA Program  is  a  proactive  aviation  safety  initiative  that  analyzes  routine  flight  data  to  detect, measure and mitigate mishap precursors while protecting crew identity. 5.10.1.  Currently, the MFOQA Program uses former Air Force instructor pilots (IPs) under contract  with  the  Safety  Center  to  analyze  the  flight  data  and  produce  monthly  reports  for aircrew,  operational  leaders  and  safety  officers.  The  MFOQA  analysts  study  the  aggregate data  to  establish  a  baseline  of  normal  flight  operations,  detect  trends  toward  operational limits,  and  examine  exceedances  of  preset  parameters.  The  result  of  such  analyses  allows leaders to intervene to correct adverse mission and safety trends before they lead to mishaps. Subsequent  analyses  of  the  same  data  allow  leaders  to  objectively  measure  whether  the corrective action was effective. 5.10.2.  Commanders  and  safety  professionals  can  utilize  MFOQA  to  validate  effectiveness of  tactics,  training  and  procedures  by  measuring  what  actually  happens  out  in  the  system; compare actual versus calculated aircraft performance data; obtain insight on how effectively 70 AFI91-202  24 JUNE 2015 flights  are  following  mission  profiles;  learn  where  unstable  approaches  and  go-arounds  are most likely to occur; detect exact parts of profiles where over/under-loads, over-speeds, and over-temps  are  most  likely  to  occur;  measure  variations  in  mission  accomplishment  within pre-established limits in order to optimize processes; and assess whether a procedural change has had a positive or negative effect on operations. Also, safety professionals and leaders can request  customized  analyses  that  lend  specific  insights  into  their  operations.  Contact AFSEC/SEF at afsec/sefe@us.af.mil. 5.11.  Airman  Safety  Action  Program  (ASAP).  The  Air  Force  ASAP  initiative  provides  a voluntary, web-based reporting tool to report errors and hazards. 5.11.1.  ASAP  is  designed  to  capture  hazards  and  errors  detected  by  airfield  operations, aircrew and maintainers and to distribute that information throughout the aviation community so  that  all  may  benefit.  ASAP  also  provides  leadership  with  evidence  of  risk  that  may otherwise be invisible, so that risk management actions can be taken to improve safety. 5.11.2.  Commanders  and  safety  professionals  utilize  ASAP  to  uncover  the  latest  hazards; obtain  information  needed  to  brief-up  threats  and  errors  related  to  airfields,  terrain,  or  air traffic  control  (ATC);  and  identify  seldom  seen  navigation  or  weather  traps.  The  program allows  decision-makers  to  look  across  different  mission  design  series  (MDS)  to  perceive system-wide  problems,  with  command  and  control,  or  with  non-U.S.  transient  alert.  ASAP also enhances the self-learning, self-awareness and self-correction that take place as reporters are  guided  through  a  user-friendly  interface  that  prompts  reflection  and  analysis  of  what occurred. 5.11.3.  ASAP  reports  can  be  filed  and  viewed  by  anyone  with  a  Common  Access  Card (CAC) by accessing the following website: http://www.safety-masap.com/. 5.12.  Line Operations Safety Audit (LOSA).  The Air Force LOSA Program is a non-punitive, unobtrusive,  peer-to-peer  observation  program  that  collects  safety-related  flight  data  during normal operations in order to assess safety margins and improvement measures. 5.12.1.  LOSA  is  designed  to  provide  early  warnings  of  developing  safety  problems.  The program works by selecting and training highly qualified crewmembers to ride on jump seats during  routine  flights  to  record  the  threats  encountered  by  aircrew,  the  types  of  errors committed and how the crews managed those threats and errors in order to maintain safety. How  crews  manage  threats  and  errors  provides  excellent  insights  into  training  and organizational  culture.  LOSA  observers  also  study  Crew  Resource  Management  (CRM) performance and perform a carefully structured interview to collect aircrew input for safety improvement. 5.12.2.  LOSA  can  be  used  by  commanders  and  safety  professionals  to  systematically  and scientifically  identify  the  strengths  and  weaknesses  of  normal  operations,  decrease  the frequency  of  undesirable  events,  assess  the  quality  and  usability  of  procedures,  detect inappropriate techniques, identify design issues with automation as evidenced through mode errors and aircrew use, and detect normalization of deviance in the form of workarounds and shortcuts used by aircrew, air traffic controllers and dispatchers. 5.13.

Mishap  metrics  (calculated  as  a  number  of  events  against some  kind  of  exposure)  are  an  effective  way  to  compare  the  actions  and  accomplishments  of your unit. Consideration must be given to the differences in operations, environment, equipment or other variables when comparing organizations or MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs. The metrics used by  the  safety  community  to  this  point  have  focused  on  results  –  the  number  of  mishaps experienced  over  time  relative  to  exposure.  HQ  AFSEC  uses  standardized  rates  for  metrics below: 5.14.1.  Aviation Mishaps. 5.14.1.1.  Total  USAF  Aviation  Class  A/B  Metric.  This  metric  identifies  the  number  of USAF  aviation  mishaps  (to  include  flight,  flight-related  aircraft  ground  operations  and remotely  piloted  aircraft  [RPA])  and  aircraft  flight  and  RPA  mishap  rates  per  100,000 flying hours. The Class A/B rate is calculated as the total number of Class A/B mishaps multiplied by 100,000 flying hours divided by the total number of flying hours. 5.14.1.2.  USAF  Class  A  Aviation  Flight  Mishap  Metric.  This  metric  identifies  the number of USAF Class A aircraft flight mishaps per 100,000 flying hours. 5.14.1.3.  Aviation-Related  Fatalities  Metric.  This  metric  identifies  the  number  of fatalities due to USAF aviation mishaps and mishap rates per 100,000 flying hours. 5.14.1.4.  Destroyed  USAF  Aircraft  Metric.  This  metric  identifies  the  number  of destroyed  USAF  aircraft  due  to  aviation  mishaps  and  mishap  rates  per  100,000  flying hours. 5.14.1.5.  USAF  RPA  A/B  Metric.  This  metric  identifies  the  number  of  USAF  RPA mishaps and the RPA mishap rate per 100,000 flying hours. 5.14.1.6.  USAF  RPA  Destroyed  Metric.  This  metric  identifies  the  number  of  USAF destroyed RPA and the rate per 100,000 flying hours. 5.14.2.  Class  A  &  B  Weapons  Metric.  This  metric  identifies  the  total  Class  A  and  B weapons mishaps. 5.14.3.  Class  A  &  B  Space  Metric.  This  metric  identifies  the  total  Class  A  and  B  Space mishaps. 5.14.4.  Ground Mishaps. 5.14.4.1.  On  Duty  Ground  Metric  (Rate).  This  metric  applies  to  both  military  and civilian  personnel  and  is  used  to  identify  the  number  of  mishaps,  fatalities  or  injuries experienced by military and civilian personnel while on duty per 100,000 personnel per FY.  To  calculate  daily,  monthly  or  yearly  on-duty  rates,  multiply  the  total  number  of military  and  civilian  mishap,  fatalities  or  injuries  by  100,000  personnel  divided  by  the military and civilian strength. Note:    AFSEC calculates daily and yearly statistics based upon AFPC/ARPC strength numbers. 5.14.4.2.  Off-Duty Ground Metric (Rate). This metric applies only to military personnel and  is  used  to  identify  the  number  of  mishaps,  fatalities  or  injuries  experienced  by  off-duty  military  personnel  per  100,000  personnel  per  year.  To  calculate  daily,  monthly  or yearly off-duty rates, multiply the total number of military mishap, fatalities or injuries x 72 AFI91-202  24 JUNE 2015 100,000 personnel divided by the military  strength.  Note:    AFSEC  calculates daily and yearly statistics based upon AFPC/ARPC strength numbers. 5.14.4.3.  Private Motor Vehicle (PMV) Off-duty Metric (Rate). This metric applies only to  military  personnel  and  is  used  to  identify  the  number  of  off-duty  PMV  fatalities experienced by off-duty military personnel per 100,000 personnel. 5.14.4.4.  Total Case Incident Rate (TCIR). This metric applies only to civilian personnel and  is  used  to  identify  the  total  number  of  recordable  (Class  A,  B,  C,  and  D)  civilian injuries and illness cases per 100 full-time employees that a site has experienced per year. The TCIR is calculated as follows:  TCIR = (Total number of injuries x 200,000)/Number of man-hours worked. Rationale: The 200,000 hours are based on 100 full-time workers working 40 hours per week, 50 weeks each year (100 x 40 hours per week x 50 weeks). Total man hours worked equals the personnel strength x 40 hours per week x 50 weeks per year plus overtime hours worked. Note:  Actual hours to include overtime should be used for computing civilian hours worked. 5.14.4.5.  Days  Away,  Restricted,  and/or  Transfer  (DART)  Case  Incidence  Rate.  This metric  applies  only  to  civilian  personnel  and  is  used  to  identify  the  total  number  of recordable civilian injuries and illness cases per 100 full-time employees resulting in days away from work, restricted work activity, and/or job transfer that a site has experienced in  a  given  time  frame.  The  DART  is  calculated  as  follows:    DART  =  (Total  incidents resulting  in  days  away,  restricted  work  or  transfer  x  200,000)/Number  of  man-hours worked.  Rationale:  The  200,000  hours  are  based  on  100  full-time  workers  working  40 hours per week, 50 weeks each  year (100 x 40 hours per week x 50 weeks). Total  man hours worked equals the personnel strength x 40 hours per week x 50 weeks per year plus overtime hours worked. Note:  Actual hours to include overtime should be used for computing civilian hours worked.  5.14.4.6.  To  compare  your  TCIR  and  DART  rates  go  to  the  Bureau  of  Labor  Statistics (BLS) website at http://www.osha.gov/oshstats/work.html for national averages. 5.15.  Calculating Federal  Employee  Compensation Metric  (Rate).  This metric applies only to  civilian  personnel.  These  rates  are  related  to  civilian  claims  that  result  for  on-duty  civilian mishaps per 200,000 hours of exposure. To calculate the rates, multiply  the number of civilian compensation  claims  by  200,000  hours  divided  by  civilian  strength  multiplied  by  2,000  hours plus overtime hours, e.g., (Total number of civilian compensation claims x 200,000)/Number of man-hours  worked.  Rationale:  The  2,000  hours  equates  to  40  hours  per  week  x  50  weeks  per year. 5.16.  AFSAS Analysis and Query Tools. 5.16.1.  AFSAS  Data  Extraction  Tool  (DET).  The  DET  was  developed  to  supply  AFSAS users with a quick and easy tool for obtaining historical mishap data. The DET will generally meet  the  majority  of  requests  for  raw  data,  with  the  added  capability  to  extract  the  data  to either MS-Excel, HTML or MS-Word. 5.16.2.  AFSAS  Advanced  Query  Tool.  AFSAS  Advanced  Query  Tool  is  a  Business Intelligence  capability  that  provides  users  a  repository  of  ready-to-go  reports,  formatted  to define  requirements.  Reports  found  within  the  repository  were  developed  to  fulfill  the AFI91-202  24 JUNE 2015 73 requirements  of  Air  Force  safety  personnel  to  generate  periodic  dashboard-like  briefings  to senior  leadership.  Typically,  these  reports  have  specific,  repetitive  data  and  presentation requirements that change very little over time. 5.16.2.1.  AFSAS  Advanced Query Tool reports  retrieve data directly  from  AFSAS  and other  systems  automatically,  on  a  daily  basis,  leaving  safety  professionals  more  time  to focus on other important tasks other than building repetitive briefings. 5.16.2.2.  In  addition,  the  Tool  also  offers  an  advance  query  tool  called  Query  Studio. Query  Studio  offers  users  the  capability  to  the  DET,  to  create  simple  queries,  but  with greater options to conform data into charts and graphs for presentations. 74 AFI91-202  24 JUNE 2015 Chapter 6 DEPLOYMENT AND CONTINGENCY SAFETY 6.1.

AFFOR/SE  will  conduct  semi-annual  visits  to  AOR  Operating Locations  and  deployed  units.  Additionally,  AFFOR  safety  will  conduct  interim  visits  as requested by AEW/G commanders. Due to the cyclical nature of deployed personnel, these visits are an important tool to reinforce safety presence with the subordinate units. SAVs will focus on AFI91-202  24 JUNE 2015 79 areas  requested  by  the  AEW/AEG  safety  office  or  as  determined  by  AFFOR/SE,  based  on previous PE reports and other correspondence. 80 AFI91-202  24 JUNE 2015 Chapter 7 AVIATION SAFETY 7.1.  Program Management.  Each unit conducting or supporting flight operations must have an aviation  safety  program.  The  COS  or  senior  installation  safety  representative  will  ensure  an active safety presence at the installation through the plans, programs and training responsibilities outlined below. (T-0) 7.1.1.  The host safety office is responsible for the base aviation safety program. 7.1.2.  Tenant units coordinate their flight safety programs with the host to avoid duplication. If the host does not have an FSO allocation, the largest tenant with an allocation manages the base  flight  safety  program.  If  neither  the  host  nor  the  tenant  has  an  FSO  allocation,  flight safety responsibilities revert to the host COS. 7.2.  Plans.  The  FSO/FSM/  FSNCO  will  help  develop  and  review  appropriate  emergency response  plans  and  coordinate  on  any  other  installation  plans  involving  flight  safety  or  aircraft emergencies. These plans should include but are not limited to: (T-3) 7.2.1.  Installation  Emergency  Management  Plan  (IEMP).  The  COS  is  responsible  for ensuring  that  units  develop  an  aviation  specific  portion  of  the  IEMP.  The  COS  ensures  the plan  defines  roles,  responsibilities  and  notification  requirements  for  leadership  and  all involved  agencies.  The  IEMP  should  include  elements  of  or  a  reference  to  existing  plans concerning  the  disaster  response  required  by  AFI  10-2501,  Air  Force  Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning and Operations. (T-3) 7.2.2.  Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Plan. The host safety office, or assigned tenant  unit  with  a  flying  mission,  will  establish  the  BASH  plan,  to  include,  defining  the nature and extent of wildlife hazards and implementation of the plan. (T-2) 7.2.2.1.  Plan  implementation  may  require  environmental  controls  and  changes  to bird/wildlife  dispersal/removal  techniques  and  operational  procedures.  Cooperative agreements for managing fish and wildlife resources require coordination with state and Federal  conservation  agencies  prior  to  implementation.  IAW  AFI  32-7064,  paragraph 14.1,  the  Integrated  Natural  Resource  Management  Plan  must  support  the  installation’s BASH  plan.  The  BASH  plan  must  identify  local  procedures  and  permits  for  the  proper collection, handling and disposal of wildlife carcasses and biological material discovered on the airfield and aircraft. (T-3)  7.2.2.2.  BASH  plans include  environmental considerations included in the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA), and, when available, input from local, regional or governmental environment and wildlife personnel. for  OCONUS locations should 7.3.  Programs.  The  COS  will  ensure  the  following  programs  are  established,  maintained  and reviewed at least annually. (T-3) 7.3.1.  BASH  Program.

Administer  Air  Force’s  wildlife  hazard  advisory  systems  and  bird feather/wildlife strike remains identification program. 7.3.1.1.14.  Provide technical assistance to Safety Investigation Board president when a wildlife hazard may be a factor in a mishap. 7.3.1.1.15.  Chair the Air Force BASH Steering Group meetings, as needed. 7.3.1.2.  Air Education Training Command (AETC) will: 7.3.1.2.1.  Incorporate  wildlife  aircraft  strike  hazard  reduction  training  into  AETC-sponsored formal training courses used to educate base pest management specialists, safety technicians and airfield managers in wildlife aircraft strike hazard reduction. 7.3.1.2.2.  Incorporate safety  awareness  of wildlife aircraft strike hazards  into safety briefings  provided  at  joint  undergraduate  navigator  training,  joint  specialized undergraduate pilot training (JSUPT), and pilot instructor training (PIT) programs. 7.3.1.3.  MAJCOMs will: 7.3.1.3.1.  Annually  review  BASH  plans  from  each  installation  conducting  or supporting  flight  operations.  Ensure  all  tenant  units  are  included  in  the  base  BASH plan. 7.3.1.3.2.  Conduct  on-site  reviews  of  installation  BASH  programs,  to  include potential hazards and mitigation techniques, at least every 36 months. Coordinate as needed  with  HQ  AFSEC/SEFW.  Tenant  unit  BASH  programs  will  be  reviewed  by owning  MAJCOMS  and  may  be  scheduled  during  reoccurring  inspections  or  staff assistance visits. 7.3.1.3.3.  Consider  potential  wildlife  strike  hazards  when  developing  or  revising operational  procedures,  training  routes,  ranges,  instrument  approach  and  departure procedures, establishing MOA or low altitude tactical navigation areas. 7.3.1.4.  National Guard Bureau (NGB) will: 7.3.1.4.1.  Ensure  each  ANG  installation/unit  conducting  or  supporting  flight operations  has  an  annually  reviewed  written  BASH  plan.  Ensure  all  tenant  units, where applicable, are included in the ANG base BASH plan. 7.3.1.4.2.  Conduct  on-site  reviews  of  installation  BASH  programs,  to  include potential hazards and mitigation techniques, at least every 72 months. Coordinate as needed  with  HQ  AFSEC/SEFW.  Non-ANG  tenant  unit  BASH  programs  will  be reviewed  by  owning  MAJCOMs  at  least  every  36  months  and  may  be  scheduled during recurring inspections or staff assistance visits. 7.3.1.4.3.  Consider  potential  wildlife  strike  hazards  when  developing  or  revising operational  procedures,  training  routes,  ranges,  instrument  approach  and  departure procedures, establishing MOA or low altitude tactical navigation areas. 7.3.1.5.  Wing, Base and Installation Safety Offices are responsible for the following: 7.3.1.5.1.  Base  Level  BASH  Program.  Host  Air  Force,  AFRC  and  ANG installations/units that support any type of Air Force flight operations at their airfield will establish a BASH program unless delegated to a different organization through a AFI91-202  24 JUNE 2015 83 formal agreement (i.e., Contract, Host-Tenant Support Agreement, MOA). However, if  a  formal  agreement  cannot  be  reached  that  is  amenable  to  all  parties  involved, primary  responsibility  for  the  BASH  program  will  default  to  the  organization responsible  for  management  of  the  flight  safety  program.  The  BASH  program  will include all tenant flying units. The BASH program requires complete documentation of local wildlife hazards, effects on missions and possible solutions to include hazards surrounding ranges used by local flying units. Tenant units located on an airfield that is not hosted by the Air Force, AFRC or ANG will establish a BASH program with the host authority (civilian airport, Naval Air Station, Federal airfield, etc.). Units that operate  RPAs  beyond  line  of  sight,  such  as  Contingency  Operations,  and  have  no other  local  physical  flying  assets  assigned  to  them  are  not  required  to  maintain  a BASH plan for their geographically-separated operating location. (T-3) 7.3.1.5.2.  Review the BASH plan annually for accuracy and compliance with current directives,  revising  as  necessary.  Ensure  all  tenant  units  are  included  in  the  base BASH plan. If applicable, document avian radar operational procedures in the unit’s BASH Plan, Operational Instruction or local supplement prior to use. (T-3) 7.3.1.5.3.  BASH  programs  at  overseas  locations  depend  on  international  agreement provisions, Geographic Combatant Command (GCC) policy and host nation support. MAJCOMs  will  evaluate  those  plans  to  ensure  the  spirit  of  this  instruction  is complied with to the maximum extent possible. 7.3.1.5.4.  Each  installation  with  flying  operations  must  develop  procedures  within the BASH plan that lists responsibilities and methods for wildlife control. Due to the complexities  of  hazard  abatement  and  potential  for  loss  of  aircraft  and  crew,  it  is strongly  recommended  that  a  dedicated  wildlife  hazard  management  specialist  be retained on staff. (T-3) 7.3.1.5.5.  Establish  a  Bird  Hazard  Working  Group  (BHWG)  consisting  of organizations  involved  in  airfield  wildlife  control,  natural  resources  management, operations  and  safety.  The  BHWG  must  meet  at  least  semi-annually  with  minutes maintained. The Vice Wing Commander of AF Flight Assets or equivalent will chair this  meeting.  The  BHWG  will  coordinate  base  improvement  projects,  e.g.,  grounds maintenance, wastewater treatment, golf courses, for BASH-related issues. (T-3)  7.3.1.5.6.  Develop  a  Bird  Hazard  Warning  System  to  inform  aircrews  of  possible flight  hazards  due  to  wildlife  activity  in  local  areas.  Bird  Watch  Condition  (BWC) codes will be used to communicate local wildlife activity along with location, number and  type  of  wildlife.  Installation  BASH  plans  will  specify  aircrew  notification procedures  for  BWC  changes.  The  most  expeditious  means  of  communicating  the status  change should be  used, e.g.,  ATC or SOF  radio  transmissions combined with Automated Terminal Information Service (ATIS) updates or other broadcast medium. Note:  BWC codes are based on observations of local airfield wildlife activity and are independent  of  Bird  Avoidance  Model  (BAM)  or  Avian  Hazard  Advisory  System (AHAS)  risk  hazard  levels.  Note:    BWC  SEVERE  or  MODERATE  requires  action from the installation’s wildlife dispersal team to reduce the BWC to LOW as soon as possible. BWC codes are defined as: (T-3) 7.3.1.5.6.1.  SEVERE.  Wildlife  activity  on  or  immediately  above  the  active 84 AFI91-202  24 JUNE 2015 runway  or  other  specific  location  representing  high  potential  for  strikes. Supervision  and  aircrews  must  thoroughly  evaluate  mission  need  before conducting operations in areas under condition SEVERE. 7.3.1.5.6.2.  MODERATE.  Wildlife  activity  near  the  active  runway  or  other specific location representing increased potential for strikes. BWC MODERATE requires  increased  vigilance  by  all  agencies  and  supervisors  and  caution  by aircrews. 7.3.1.5.6.3.  LOW.  Wildlife  activity  on  and  around  the  airfield  representing  low potential for strikes. 7.3.1.5.7.  Designate  Phase  I  and  Phase  II  periods  of  wildlife  activity  based  on historical  wildlife  activity  information.  Phase  I  represents  normal,  baseline  wildlife activity.  Phase  II  represents  times  of  significant  increases  in  local  wildlife  activity, normally  associated  with  migratory  movements,  seasonal  increases  of  local  wildlife populations,  or  local  land  use  practices  (farming,  ranching,  or  hunting).  Establish flight and scheduling procedures to minimize risks based on local hazards associated with Phase I and II. Publish Phase I and II designations in the appropriate DoD Flight Information  Publications.  Critical  updates  may  be  made  using  Notice  to  Airman System. 7.3.1.5.8.  Regardless  of  Phase  designation,  the  highest  levels  of  daily  wildlife activity normally occur +/- one hour of sunrise/sunset as birds move to and from their roosts.  Flight  operations  should  be  avoided  during  these  periods  unless  mission essential.  A  risk  analysis  shall  be  completed  to  determine  the  potential  risk  to operations  during  these  periods.  Missions  scheduled  during  +/-  one  hour  of  sunrise and  sunset  should  be  included  in  pre-mission  risk  management  and  analysis worksheets. Appropriate measures should be taken to mitigate the risk if required. 7.3.1.5.9.  Maintain  a  zero-tolerance  towards  large  free-roaming  animals  on  or adjacent  to  the  aircraft  movement  area.  Note:    Free-roaming  animals  are,  but  not limited to, deer, canines, geese, etc. (T-3) 7.3.1.5.10.  Grass  Height.  Mow  aircraft  movement  area  (AMA)  to  maintain  a  grass height between 7 and 14 inches. The AMA is that area of the airfield encompassed by the  Primary  Surface  and  the  Clear  Zones,  as  well  as  apron  areas  and  taxiways, regardless of their location. As a minimum, turf shall be maintained 500 feet outside the AMA boundary where able. Installations located in arid climates where growing grass is difficult may develop natural vegetation on the airfield to limit attractiveness to  wildlife.  These  situations  require  comprehensive  vegetation/wildlife  hazard management  and  will  be  reviewed  individually  by  HQ  AFSEC/SEFW  for  approval. Installation  safety  offices  may  request  a  grass  height  restriction  waiver  from  HQ AFSEC/SEFW after MAJCOM coordination. (T-1) 7.3.1.5.11.  Technical Assistance. Technical assistance is available through the USAF BASH  Team,  HQ  AFSEC/SEFW,  9700  G  Avenue,  Suite  266,  Kirtland  AFB,  NM 87117-5670.

Hazardous  Air  Traffic  Reporting  (HATR)  and  High  Accident  Potential  (HAP) Programs. HATR and HAP information is vital to Air Force flight safety. Use of information taken from these reports is for mishap prevention, not to initiate disciplinary actions. HATR information is not privileged information and is releasable outside Air Force channels except for the identity of the personnel involved. Responsibilities for establishing and administering the HATR and HAP program include: 7.3.2.1.  Unit  commanders  will  ensure  AF  Form  651,  Hazardous  Air  Traffic  Report (HATR),  and  AF  Form  457,  USAF  Hazard  Report,  are  available  to  aircrews  at  base operations  facilities,  flying  squadron  operations  offices,  in  trip  kits  and  USAF  ATC facilities.  Commanders  must  emphasize  the  importance  of  identifying  hazardous situations  and  direct  the  filing  of  appropriate  HATRs  or  HAP  events  as  a  method  of preventing future mishaps. (T-3) 7.3.2.2.  Unit  safety  offices  will  investigate  HAPs  and  HATRs  IAW  AFI  91-204  and AFMAN  91-223.  The  FSO  or  FSM  will  ensure  HATR  reporting  procedures  and requirements  are  briefed  at  least  annually  to  aircrew  and  ATC  personnel.  Refer  to AFMAN 91-223 for reporting requirements. (T-1) 7.3.3.  Midair  Collision  Avoidance  (MACA)  Program.  Units  with  flying  programs  must establish  a  written  MACA  program.  The  unit  safety  office  is  responsible  for  its  creation, documentation and upkeep. The FSO/FSM works closely with the OG-determined OPR and other  interested  parties  such  as  the  Airfield  Operations  Flight  Commander  (AOF/CC),  the airspace  manager,  local  Fixed  Base  Operators  (FBOs),  Aircraft  Owners  and  Pilots Association  (AOPA), and the local  Flight  Standards District Officer (FSDO), to  establish a comprehensive MACA program. Use the resources and services of the FAA FSDO accident prevention  specialists.  Tailor  the  MACA  program  to  meet  local  needs.  As  a  minimum,  the FSO/FSM will coordinate with appropriate agencies to accomplish these key objectives: (T-3) 7.3.3.1.  Ensure  the  free  flow  of  MACA  information  between  host  and  tenant organizations,  effective  communication  between  base  and  local  airport  managers  and fixed base operators (FBOs), and actively support the HATR Program. (T-3) 7.3.3.2.  Evaluate  the  midair  collision  potential  with  civil  airlines  and  work  with operators of nearby airfields to reduce risk and minimize the hazards. (T-3) country’s language host 7.3.3.3.  Develop a MACA pamphlet. The MACA pamphlet is a host-wing responsibility. Tenant  units  will  provide  MDS-specific  information  as  required  and  will  coordinate  on the  host-wing  pamphlet.  Overseas  locations  should  consider  publishing  the  pamphlet  in the educational programs/publications  to  general  aviation  servicing  facilities  to  increase  the  use  of available  radar  services  among  civil  aircraft.  Develop  appropriate  maps  and  graphics showing  the  base  radar  services  and  routes.  Distribute  the  maps  to  all  civil  airfield managers,  fixed  base  operators,  military  base  operations,  airports  and  other  flying operations that use the surrounding airspace. (T-3) along  with  English.  Provide 86 AFI91-202  24 JUNE 2015 7.3.3.4.  Units may combine MACA programs with other military organizations in a 50-mile range of their base. This  will require  more  coordination efforts  but  will result in  a better product to be used by the area’s civilian population. 7.3.3.5.  Units  and  MAJCOMs  are  encouraged  to  participate  in  the  DoD-endorsed  and FAA-hosted www.SEEandAVOID.org (MACA website). 7.3.4.  Awards Program. Ensure proper recognition of personnel through the Air Force Safety Awards Program as outlined in AFI 36-2833, Safety Awards. (T-3) 7.3.5.  Operational/Training Squadron Flight Safety Program. The squadron commander will maintain  overall  supervision  of  the  flight  safety  program.  The  Squadron  Assigned  Flight Safety  Officer  (SAFSO)  represents  an  extension  of  the  wing  flight  safety  program  at  the squadron level. In addition to managing the squadron flight safety program, these individuals are still responsible for carrying out all normal wing safety duties as requested by Wing COS. Units  possessing  aircraft  with  enlisted  crew  positions  should  also  consider  appointing  an enlisted  crewmember  as  additional  duty  flight  safety  NCO  to  assist  in  the  flight  safety program. (T-3) 7.3.5.1.  The  squadron  commander  will  ensure accomplished by the SAFSOs: (T-3) that the  following  actions  are 7.3.5.1.1.  Upon appointment, contact the wing safety office for required training. (T-3) 7.3.5.1.2.  Administer  the  unit  safety  program  using  this  instruction  as  a  guide  and management tool.

Maintain unit safety bulletin boards. (T-0) 7.3.6.  Data-centric Proactive Safety Programs. Chiefs of Safety and unit-level staffs will use MFOQA,  ASAP  and  LOSA  proactive  safety  as  correlated  data  streams  for  hazard identification  and risk mitigation to  prevent  mishaps and accomplish  the mission. Proactive safety  programs  enable  leaders,  safety  professionals,  aircrews  and  support  personnel  to achieve efficiencies in maintenance, operations, safety, tactics and training. These programs affect positive change in the Air Force by engendering a culture where personnel are willing AFI91-202  24 JUNE 2015 87 to  identify  hazards  and  errors,  not  cover  them  up.  See  paragraphs    5.10  –    5.12  for  a  more detailed description of MFOQA, ASAP and LOSA. 7.4.  Aero Club Operations.  The host unit commander appoints an FSO as a safety advisor to the base Aero Club. If the host unit does not have an assigned FSO, the commander will obtain the assistance of a tenant unit FSO to provide safety assistance to the Aero Club. The host safety office  may  investigate  Aero  Club  mishaps  IAW  AFI  91-204.  However,  the  National Transportation  Safety  Board  (NTSB)  or  host  nation  civil  aviation  authority  has  primary responsibility  for  investigating  and  reporting.  Refer  to  AFI  34-117,  Air  Force  Aero  Club Program, for further guidance on Aero Club support. The wing safety advisor should attend the monthly aero club safety meetings. 7.5.

The DoD Components are  authorized  to  request  through  the  DUSD  (I&E)  that  NIOSH  perform  hazard  evaluations. OSHA  inspection  procedures  for  federal  agency  workplaces  are  provided  in  OSHA  Directive Number CPL 02-00-150 (Reference (u)). 8.8.1.  The DoL may conduct, as part of its evaluation program, annual targeted inspections or program assistance visits of Air Force installations based on the comparative incidence of worker  compensation  claims.  The  DoL  will  prescribe  special  procedures  in  the  notification process.  OSHA  representatives  may  question  or  privately  interview  any  employee, supervisory  employee  or  official  in  charge  of  an  operation  or  workplace.  Federal  or  state OSHA representatives must present identifying credentials and state the purpose of the visit to the installation commander or authorized representative before conducting an inspection of a workplace on an Air Force installation. Installation commanders, through execution of local approved written procedures IAW paragraphs  1.8.13.13 and  8.3.12, will: (T-1)  8.8.1.1.  Ensure  Security  Forces  notifies  the  installation  safety  office  of  OSHA’s  arrival at the gate. (T-2) 8.8.1.2.  Ensure the OSHA representatives will be met and escorted during their visit. (T-2) 8.8.1.3.  Host an initial  in-brief with  DoL  OSHA representatives. The installation safety office  will  notify  their  CC/CV  and  IG  of  OSHA’s  arrival.  They  will  then  notify  as applicable,  BE,  Public  Health,  FES  Flight,  Civilian  Personnel  Office,  tenant  unit  safety offices  and  others  as  needed  of  the  in-brief  meeting  details.  CC,  IG,  Contracting  and Civilian Personnel Office attendance is optional. The BE, Public Health, FES Flight and tenant  unit  safety  offices  will  be  expected  to  attend  based  upon  the  OSHA  inspector’s stated purpose of their visit. (T-2) 8.8.1.4.  Upon  request,  provide  access  to  available  safety,  fire  protection  and  health information on workplaces. (T-2) 8.8.1.4.1.  While OSHA officials may review “For Official Use Only” mishap reports in  the  workplace  during  the  course  of  their  inspection,  do  not  release  “For  Official Use  Only”-marked  reports  or  materials  to  them.  OSHA  requests  for  copies  of  such reports or materials must be obtained through the DoL IAW the provisions of AFI 91-204. (T-2) 8.8.1.4.2.  OSHA  officials  with  appropriate  need  to  know  may  review  Airmen exposure  records  and  specific  parts  of  Airmen  medical  records  pertaining  to  the OSHA  complaint.  The  OSHA  official  must  safeguard  the  individual’s  medical information according to HIPAA laws. 96 AFI91-202  24 JUNE 2015 8.8.1.5.  Provide photographic or video support, if required. Videos or photographs taken on installations fall under the exclusive control of the installation commander. Air Force officials  may  review  negatives,  photographs  and  videos  before  release  if  they  suspect possible disclosure of classified or proprietary information without the review. 8.8.1.6.  Arrange  a  closing  conference  with  the  OSHA  official  if  requested  and  invite labor representatives to attend. 8.8.2.  Treat  DoL  OSHA  notices  of  hazards  in  the  same  manner  as  an  Air  Force  inspector report. Evaluate and assign a RAC to each hazard identified by OSHA inspectors. (T-1) 8.8.3.  Ensure Airmen verify DoL inspection results, including all testing. Air Force tests or sampling for future testing should be accomplished at the same time and at the same location as the DoL testing, if possible. (T-1) 8.8.4.  Ensure that DoL  personnel  conducting the inspection receive a coordinated response to DoL inspection reports as required and prescribed by the OSHA Citation instructions. If an OSHA inspection team visits the installation and it appears there may be possible notices of safety  or  unhealthy  workplace  violations,  the  installation  commander’s  staff,  to  include  IG, JA,  PA,  Contracting  Office  and  others  as  appropriate,  should  be  notified  and  involved  in abatement  plan  establishment.  Although  a  unit  will  be  cited  individually  at  a  particular location,  the  identified  hazard  may,  in  fact,  be  classified  a  “Repeat”  citation,  because  a similar finding was previously cited at another installation. This practice is because OSHA is treating the Air Force as an “Enterprise” organization. Therefore, the finding is considered a corporate  matter  rather  than  a  singular  installation  matter.  In  such  cases,  notify  AFSEC. AFSEC  needs  to  be  involved  in  the  tracking  of  the  hazard(s)  from  identification  through proposed response to OSHA and subsequent closure. Upon receiving a citation, the cited unit will draft a proposed official response to the violation, which will be sent simultaneously to the  applicable  MAJCOM/DRU/FOA  safety  office  and  the  AFSEC  Occupational  Safety Office  (SEG)  for  review  prior  to  releasing  the  response  to  OSHA.  Units  will  need  to  build this additional coordination into the time frame allowed for the suspense to OSHA. Provide copies of the inspection report, replies to DoL, and related correspondence through command channels to the addressees listed in paragraphs  8.8.5.1 –  8.8.5.9. (T-1)  8.8.5.  In addition to local notifications, such as installation JA, PA, CC or CV, and affected organizations  or  tenant  activities,  installation  safety  offices  shall  notify  the  agencies  in paragraphs  8.8.5.1 –  8.8.5.9 within two duty days of any official DoL OSHA visit to an Air Force installation, to  include AF-led Joint Bases.  (T-1) This  requirement  also  applies when an installation receives a formal request from OSHA to self-investigate a fire, safety or health matter  on  OSHA’s  behalf.  Notification  shall  include  unit(s)  or  specific  area(s)  being inspected. (T-1) Upon completion of the OSHA visit, health and fire officials, as applicable, shall  coordinate  responses  to  DoL  OSHA  visits  and  citations  with  the  safety  staff.  (T-1)  If cited, the safety staff will transmit a supplemental report on investigations or inspection visits within  two  workdays  after  receiving  the  DoL  OSHA  citation(s).  (T-1)  This  reporting requirement  applies  to  Air  Force  workplaces  or  operations  performed  by  a  contractor  in which  Air  Force  workplaces,  equipment  or  procedural  deficiencies  are  identified  in  the citation. Use AFSAS OSHA Event Module to transmit this report.

This Chapter establishes the roles, responsibilities and policy requirements for Safety  personnel  in  support  of  System  Safety.  System  Safety  is  the  application  of  engineering and  management  principles,  criteria  and  techniques  to  achieve  acceptable  risk  within  the constraints of operational effectiveness and suitability, time and cost throughout all phases of the system  life  cycle.  This  chapter  also  defines  how  Safety  personnel  and  organizations  interact, influence and advise the other Air Force communities that are corporately responsible for System Safety  in  the  Air  Force.  System  acquisition  and  sustainment  programs  are  subject  to  the mandatory policy and guidance described in paragraph  11.1.3. System safety principles are used to manage safety risks across many functional disciplines within the AF and form the basis for risk management. 11.1.1.  System Safety must  be a planned, integrated, comprehensive effort  employing both engineering  and  management  resources.  Effective  System  Safety  efforts  depend  on  clearly defined  safety  objectives  and  system  performance  requirements.  System  Safety  objectives shall  include,  but  not  be  limited  to,  prevention  or  mitigation  of  all  reportable  mishaps  that may  be  associated  with  a  system’s  use  and  function  throughout  its  life  cycle.  Losses  of systems,  mission  degradation,  cost  and  schedule  impacts  shall  be  considered.  The  intent  is not to duplicate work performed by related or other functional disciplines, but to ensure it is done in a systematic manner that addresses and manages mishap risk. 11.1.2.  System Safety efforts consist of eight essential elements that Program Managers will document and periodically review: 11.1.2.1.  Documenting the system safety approach. (T-1) 11.1.2.2.  Hazard identification and analysis over the system life cycle. (T-1) 11.1.2.3.  Assessment of risk, expressed as severity and probability of consequences. 11.1.2.4.  Identification and assessment of potential risk mitigation measures. (T-1) 11.1.2.5.  Implementation of measures to reduce risks to acceptable levels. (T-1) 11.1.2.6.  Verification of risk reduction. (T-1) 11.1.2.7.  Acceptance of risks by appropriate authorities. (T-1) 11.1.2.8.  Tracking of hazards and residual risks throughout the system life cycle. (T-1) 11.1.3.  Within  the  System  Safety  Program,  acquisition  and  sustainment  programs  must document and periodically review: 11.1.3.1.  System  Hazard  Tracking  Logs.  These  logs  shall  communicate  sufficient information  to  identify  and  track  the  status  of  each  hazard.  To  ensure  appropriate management  attention,  the  status  of  hazards  is  required  to  be  presented  at  program  and technical reviews. The System Safety effort supports program and technical reviews with current  information  of  all  hazards.  The  hazard  tracking  logs  must  contain  the  minimum fields required by MIL-STD-882E: 11.1.3.1.1.  A hazard description. (T-1) AFI91-202  24 JUNE 2015 109 11.1.3.1.2.  Unique identification information. (T-1) 11.1.3.1.3.  Risk  assessment  information,  including  the  initial  assessment,  the  target risk  level,  interim  assessments,  as  required,  and  the  final  (residual)  risk  assessment. (T-1) 11.1.3.1.4.  Information concerning the mitigation action(s). (T-1) 11.1.3.1.5.  Current status of the risk reduction effort. (T-1) 11.1.3.1.6.  A  record  of  user  concurrence  and  risk  acceptance  by  appropriate authorities. (T-1) 11.1.3.1.7.  A link with the PESHE. (T-1) 11.1.3.2.  Risk  Mitigation.  Programs  shall  use  the  system  safety  design  order  of precedence defined in MIL-STD-882E. 11.1.3.2.1.  Eliminate hazards through design selection. 11.1.3.2.2.  Reduce risk through design alteration. 11.1.3.2.3.  Incorporate engineered features or devices. 11.1.3.2.4.  Provide warning devices. 11.1.3.2.5.  Incorporate signage, procedures, training and PPE. 11.1.3.3.  Risk Acceptance. Every hazard that cannot be eliminated must be mitigated to the  maximum  extent  possible  and  formally  accepted  by  the  appropriate  level  of leadership  as  specified  in  DoDI  5000.02,  Operation  of  the  Defense  Acquisition  System, and AFI 63-101/20-101, Integrated Life Cycle Management. (T-1) 11.1.4.  Acquisition  and  sustainment  communities  implement  system  safety  as  an  integral part of a System Program Office's systems engineering activity as outlined in AFI 63-101/20-101. 11.1.5.  Program  Managers  are  solely  responsible  for  organizing  their  offices,  based  on system acquisition program  size and complexity, to  execute the system safety requirements elaborated in the DoD and Air Force policy in DoDI 5000.02, AFI 63-101/20-101, and MIL- STD-882E, DoD Standard Practice for System Safety. Acquisition and Sustainment Program Managers  must  integrate  system  safety  into  their  program’s  overall  Systems  Engineering effort at the same level where day-to-day engineering decisions are being made. This allows System Safety to most effectively influence system design. 11.1.6.  For  System-Level  High-Risks  requiring  Component  Acquisition  Executive  (CAE) acceptance  or  System-Level  Serious-Risks  requiring  Program  Executive  Officer  (PEO) acceptance, program managers prepare a written safety risk assessment IAW Attachment 15 that  describes  the  hazards,  predicted  risks  (stating  both  consequences  and  probabilities), available  mitigation  measures,  costs  or  other  limitations,  proposed  action(s),  alternatives, resulting  net  risk  and  the  total  of  expected  adverse  consequences  for  the  period  of acceptance. For System-Level High-Risks, coordination with the lead command(s), PEO and AF/SE is required before submission for acceptance. System-Level Serious-Risk acceptance packages must be coordinated with the lead commands and HQ AFSEC before assessments are  submitted  for  acceptance.  Program  managers  are  required  to  re-accomplish  risk 110 AFI91-202  24 JUNE 2015 assessments for CAE- or PEO-accepted risks when four years have elapsed since the last risk acceptance,  earlier  when  directed  by  the  CAE/PEO  and  when  significant  new  information (e.g.,  additional  failures/injuries,  changes  in  equipment  usage,  advances  in  mitigation technologies  and  methods,  reduction  in  mitigation  costs,  etc.)  impacts  the  risk  assessment. Re-accomplished risk assessments are then coordinated and submitted for acceptance by the appropriate authority for the new predicted risk levels. 11.1.6.1.  Program  risk  acceptance  packages  and  tracking  are  only  necessary  for  those risks  that  are  inside  the  design/specification/requirement  envelope.  Those  outside  the envelope are handled by using the user’s/operator’s RM process. 11.1.6.2.  Program safety offices shall clearly document risk acceptance authority during life cycle system decisions. 11.1.6.3.  Risk acceptance packages utilize the risk matrix defined in MIL-STD-882E and tailoring  of  the  severity  categories,  probability  levels  and/or  assessment  levels  of  this matrix  for  the  specific  programs  is  not  permitted  Except  IAW  DoDI  5000.02.  Only  the Milestone  Decision  Authority  (MDA)  may  approve  tailoring  of  severity  categories  and probability  levels  of  the  MIL-STD-882E  Matrix.  However,  Program  Offices  can  tailor the  probability  levels  without  MDA  approval  if  it  is  limited  to  providing  quantitative definitions for probability levels that are appropriate for the system being evaluated and that comply with the word definitions of probability levels. 11.2.

This  information  is  also required  to  be  documented  in  the  PESHE.  Current  High-  and  Serious-Risks  must  be presented  at  each  Program  and  Technical  Review.  The  PESHE  should  include  the program’s hazard tracking logs to maintain currency of lifecycle ESOH hazards. 11.2.5.4.  For  High-  and  Serious-Risks,  program  managers  must  prepare  a  written  risk decision package describing the hazards, predicted risks (stating both  consequences  and probabilities),  available  mitigation  measures,  costs  or  other  limitations,  proposed action(s), alternatives, resulting net mishap risk and the total expected consequences for the period of acceptance. Attachment 15 guidance is mandatory for High- and Serious-Risk acceptance packages and recommended for all other risk assessments. 11.2.5.4.1.  High-Risk  acceptance  packages  must  be  coordinated  with  the  lead commands and AF/SE before assessments are submitted for acceptance. Serious-Risk acceptance  packages  must  be  coordinated  with  the  lead  commands  and  HQ  AFSEC before  assessments  are  submitted  for  acceptance.  Programs  that  interface  with  or carry  weapons  should  also  notify  and  coordinate  applicable  High-Risk  and  Serious-Risk packages with the NNMSB and the NWSSG, as applicable. 11.2.5.4.2.  Program managers must reassess CAE- or PEO-accepted risks in response to  any  change  that  alters  the  risk  level,  milestone  reviews,  key  decisions  following approval,  or  four  years  have  elapsed  since  the  last  risk  assessment.  Reassessments should  consider  actual  incident  and  loss  experiences  for  the  period  and  advances  in mitigation  technologies  and  methods.  Revalidated  risk  assessments  must  be coordinated  and  submitted  for  acceptance  by  the  appropriate  authority  for  the  new predicted risk levels. (T-1) 11.2.5.4.3.  Risk  acceptance  packages  will  use  the  risk  matrix  defined  in  MIL-STD-882E. Contracts using previous versions of MIL-STD-882E may continue using those versions  for  contract  purposes;  however,  new  risk  acceptance  packages  must  be converted to the MIL-STD-882E matrix and definitions. Any tailoring of MIL-STD- 882E shall be accomplished IAW DoDI 5000.02 and AFI 63-101/20-101. (T-1)  AFI91-202  24 JUNE 2015 115 11.2.5.4.4.

Making safety recommendations during design, development, test, operations, sustainment and disposal. (T-1) 11.3.2.14.  Assigning risk indices to each SSG discussion and action item. 11.3.2.15.  Aircraft Information Program status to emphasize the collection and analysis of safety data. (T-1) 11.3.3.  The  SSG  develops  and  coordinates  the  SSG  charter.  The  SSG  charter  will  address the  purpose  and  scope,  mandatory  membership,  operating  procedures  and  administration  of the group. All mandatory members must commit to supporting SSG meetings and must sign the charter. Minimum mandatory membership includes the Chairperson (Program Manager, Deputy  or  Chief  Engineer),  Program  System  Safety  Manager/Engineer/Officer  (as appropriate,  Center  System  Safety  Manager,  AFSEC,  HQ  AFMC/SE  (for  non-space systems),  HQ  AFSPC/SE  (for  space  systems),  the  Lead  MAJCOM  safety  office,  AFOTEC and  the  Lead  MAJCOM  user  representative.  Optional,  advisory  members  include SAF/AQRE,  the  contractor  system  safety  manager,  program  engineering  staff  (as  needed based on issues  at  hand), Space  Launch Ranges,  and other  DoD  and industry organizations (as appropriate) as determined by mandatory members. (T-1) 11.3.4.  Within 30 working days, SSG minutes shall be sent to all SSG members and advisors and  to  SAF/AQR,  AFMC/EN  or  SMC/EN  (as  applicable),  HQ  AFSEC,  HQ  AFSPC/SE  or HQ AFMC/SE (as applicable), AFOTEC/SE, and the owning command. (T-1) 11.3.5.  SSG  recommendations  that  require  capability  changes  or  materiel  modifications  by the program office must be validated and documented IAW the process and criteria outlined in AFI 10-601. 11.4.  Networks, Automated Information Systems, and Non-Developmental Items.  Program managers  are  required  to  conduct  a  System  Safety  analysis  appropriate  for  the  system  or  item. For  non-developmental  items,  the  analysis  should  review  usage  history,  verify  intended  use similarities, evaluate differences, and plan for adequate safety evaluation for all Air Force-unique modifications  or  changes  in  use.  This  System  Safety  review  should  be  accomplished  by  the procuring/buying  agency  that  is  in  the  best  position  to  assess  the  intended  use  and  necessary modification.  For  example,  Federal  Aviation  Regulation  (FAR)  certification  requirements  are incrementally  implemented  and  may  not  apply  to  all  models  or  year  groups  of  similar  aircraft. Operations  from  military  fields  and  or  with  military  support  equipment  provide  unique  hazard opportunities  that  may  not  have  been  considered  in  the  original  design.  Exercise  care  in accepting FAA certification as a sufficient indication for safety of the design. 11.5.  System  Safety  Engineering  Analysis  (SSEA).  The  SSEA  program  evaluates  new operations  that  are  currently  prohibited  due  to  the  perceived  risks  (e.g.,  aircraft  hot  refueling, concurrent  servicing  operations,  concurrent  servicing  operations  supporting  combat  sortie generation  and  wet  wing/rapid  defueling  operations).  Based  upon  the  successful  demonstration and evaluation, approval may be granted to use the operation/procedures. 11.5.1.  SSEA  of  a  proposed  operation  is  performed  by  a  highly  qualified  team  under controlled conditions. The team conducts actual demonstrations and analysis of the operation 120 AFI91-202  24 JUNE 2015 to  validate  overall  risk  assessment  and  recommend  actions.  The  SSEA  team  is  normally chaired  by  the  AFLCMC  System  Safety  Office  and  includes  experts  from  AFMC/SES, AFSEC/SEF/SEG, and the developing/supporting and operational commands, and any other technical  experts  (as  needed)  as  determined  by  the  SSEA  Chair.  At  the  discretion  of  the SSEA  Team  Chief,  Low-Risk  SSEAs  may  be  done  via  the  in-house  “tabletop”  method without a demonstration. 11.5.2.  A  using  command  requests  a  SSEA  in  writing  to  AFLCMC/SES  and  informs  HQ AFSEC. Requests must include: (T-1) 11.5.2.1.  A complete description of the proposed operation. 11.5.2.2.  Justification for accepting the increased risk. 11.5.2.3.  Recommended location and dates for the SSEA demonstrations. 11.5.2.4.  Identification  of  other  DoD,  Government  or  foreign  agencies  that  might  be involved. 11.5.3.  The  SSEA  team  reports  the  results  of  the  analysis,  including  operational  concepts, system  descriptions,  risk  assessments,  hazard  analyses,  descriptions  of  the  demonstrations, and conclusions and recommendations to the requester. AFI91-202  24 JUNE 2015 121 Chapter 12 HAZARD ABATEMENT 12.1.  Purpose.  The  purpose  of  the  hazard  abatement  program  is  to  eliminate,  control  or  limit exposure of personnel  to  hazardous conditions.  It provides senior leaders, functional  managers, supervisors and workers with a risk-based systemic process for identifying hazard mitigation and elimination  strategies  for  hazards  in  all  workplaces  and  operations.  Additionally,  it  provides  a tracking system for hazards from identification through closure. 12.2.  Responsibilities. 12.2.1.  Each installation establishes a program to abate hazards based on a priority system. (T-2) 12.2.2.  Commanders,  supervisors  and  employees  at  all  levels  are  responsible  for  abating hazardous conditions. (T-2) 12.2.3.  Commanders  protect  national  resources,  both  human  and  material,  and  have  the responsibility to take action in implementing safety measures. (T-2) 12.2.4.  Functional managers correct hazards in their areas of responsibility. (T-2) 12.2.5.  The  safety  office  helps  commanders  assess  and  prioritize  abatement  actions  and provide the commander with follow-up support until the hazard is eliminated. (T-2) 12.2.6.  Send  projects  beyond MAJCOM/FOA/DRU. the  capability  of local  commanders to the  parent 12.3.  Planning and Engineering.  Use RM processes during the planning, design and execution phases to identify and eliminate hazards as early as possible when they will have the least cost and operational impact on the program. Continually review plans, specifications and drawings to identify and eliminate hazards until the equipment or workplace is operating with acceptable risk levels.  Reevaluate  risk  assessments  when  any  factor  applied  in  the  decision-making  process changes. (T-2) 12.4.  Procedural  Actions.  Develop  procedures  or  restrictions  to  minimize  risk  if  planning  or engineering actions cannot be used to eliminate hazards. If necessary, impose restrictions such as operational  limits,  frequent  inspections,  protective  equipment  or  stopping  the  operation  until corrective action is taken. (T-2) 12.5.  Hazard  Control  Hierarchy.  The  hierarchy  provides  a  systematic  way  to  determine  the most  effective  feasible  method  to  reduce  risk  associated  with  a  hazard.  The  types  of  hazards employees are exposed to, the severity of the hazards and the risk the hazards pose to employees should all be considered in determining methods of hazard prevention, elimination and control. 12.5.1.  In  general,  the  following  hierarchy  should  be  followed  in  determining  hazard elimination/mitigation and control methods: 12.5.1.1.  Elimination or removal of the hazard. Example would bringing work to ground level versus working at heights. 12.5.1.2.  Substitution of less hazardous materials, processes, operations, or equipment. 122 AFI91-202  24 JUNE 2015 12.5.1.3.  Engineering  controls,  such  as  removing  or  isolating  hazards,  redesigning workstations, etc. 12.5.1.4.  Administrative controls, such as warnings, buddy system, limiting exposure to hazards, etc. 12.5.1.5.  PPE as determined by an hazard analysis.  Note:  PPE should be used when all other  hazard  controls  have  been  exhausted  or  more  significant  hazard  controls  are  not feasible. 12.5.1.6.  Deleted 12.5.2.  Feasible application of this hierarchy of controls shall take into account: 12.5.2.1.  The nature and extent of the risks being controlled. 12.5.2.2.  The degree of risk reduction desired. 12.5.2.3.  The requirements of applicable local, federal,  and state statutes, standards and regulations. 12.5.2.4.  Recognized best practices in industry. 12.5.2.5.  Available technology. 12.5.2.6.  Cost-effectiveness. 12.5.2.7.  Internal organization standards. 12.5.3.  When  controlling  a  hazard,  first  consider  methods  to  eliminate  the  hazard  or substitute a less hazardous method or process. This is best accomplished in the concept and design  phases  of  any  project.  If  this  is  not  feasible,  engineering  controls  such  as  machine guards  and  ventilation  systems  should  be  considered.  This  process  continues  down  the hierarchy until the highest-level feasible control is found. Often, a combination of controls is most  effective.  In  cases  where  the  higher  order  controls  (elimination,  substitution  and implementation  of  engineering  controls)  do  not  reduce  risk  to  an  acceptable  level,  lower order controls, e.g., warnings, administrative controls, or personal protective equipment, will be used to complement engineering controls to reduce risks to an acceptable level. (T-2) 12.5.3.1.  Design  for  Minimum  Risk  (Engineering).  Engineering  controls  are  the preferred method of reducing exposure to hazards, but are not always feasible. Following are examples of engineering controls that can be implemented. 12.5.3.1.1.  Substitution of a less hazardous material. 12.5.3.1.2.  Change process to minimize exposure to a hazard. 12.5.3.1.3.  Isolation or enclosure of a process. 12.5.3.1.4.  Ventilation of a work area. 12.5.3.1.5.  Use of local exhaust, i.e., fume hoods. 12.5.3.1.6.  Reduce energy potential, e.g., use a lower voltage/amperage device. 12.5.3.2.  Incorporate  Safety  Devices.  Safety  devices  include  such  features  as  machine guards, lockouts/interlocks and limiting switches. AFI91-202  24 JUNE 2015 123 12.5.3.3.  Provide Warning Devices. Warning devices are typically audible/aural/sensory features that alert one of a hazard. 12.5.3.4.  Develop Procedures and Training. 12.5.3.4.1.  Administrative.  Administrative  control  methods,  such  as  adjusting  work schedules,  good  housekeeping  or  encouraging  best  work  practice  can  reduce  hazard exposures. Provide written guidance (e.g., TO notes/warnings/cautions) and training. 12.5.3.4.2.  Personal  Protective  Equipment  (PPE).  PPE  is  determined  by  hazard identification in hazard analysis. PPE should be used when all other hazard controls have been exhausted or more significant hazard controls are not feasible. 12.5.4.  When engineering controls have been studied, investigated and implemented, yet still do  not  bring  employees’  exposure  levels  to  below  permissible  exposure  limits,  or  when engineering controls are determined to be infeasible, then a combination of controls must be applied and followed by all affected parties. (T-2) 12.6.  Hazard Abatement Requirements.  To abate hazardous conditions: 12.6.1.  Abate  hazards  in  military-unique  equipment  and  processes  through  established systems  for  modification  and  upgrade,  e.g.,  Product  Quality  Deficiency  Reporting  Program (T.O.  00-35D-54,  USAF  Deficiency  Reporting,  Investigation,  and  Resolution),  and  Flight Manual Changes (AFI 11-215, Flight Manual Procedures). Additionally, when possible, use the same criteria specified in paragraphs  12.6.2.1 –  12.6.4.7. 12.6.2.  Hazard abatement in nonmilitary-unique workplaces must: 12.6.2.1.  Abate RACs 1, 2 and 3 hazards as soon as possible. (T-1) 12.6.2.2.  Identify abatement actions for RACs 4 and 5 hazards as soon as possible. (T-1) 12.6.3.  Select an abatement method and, if possible, interim control measures based on the hierarchy  outlined  in  paragraph    12.5.  Note:    Assigned  RAC  will  remain  until  completely abated even though interim control measures are in effect. 12.6.4.  Other factors that affect decisions on abatement actions are: 12.6.4.1.  Impact to mission. 12.6.4.2.  Technical feasibility and cost of available options. 12.6.4.3.  Number of personnel exposed and length of time exposed. 12.6.4.4.  Previous mishap experience. 12.6.4.5.  Future use of workplaces or equipment. 12.6.4.6.  Alternative methods to control the hazard or protect personnel. 12.6.4.7.  Interim control measures in effect. 12.6.5.  Attachment  6  through  9  provide  additional  instructions  for  assigning  RACs, determining abatement priority numbers, and completing AF Forms 3 and 1118. 12.7.  Critical/Imminent  Danger  Situations.  Anyone  identifying  a  critical/imminent  danger situation will immediately  bring it to  the attention of the commander and supervisor in  charge. (T-1) Commanders or supervisors must take immediate action to eliminate or control the hazard 124 AFI91-202  24 JUNE 2015 or  cease  operations  and  withdraw  exposed  personnel  until  the  situation  is  safe.  (T-1)  Note:  Military-unique  operations  are  not  covered  under  this  requirement.  Military  operations  are,  by nature, high risk and tasks required can pose an imminent risk of death or serious bodily harm. 12.8.  Posting  Notification  of  Hazards.  The  fire,  safety  or  health  officials  complete  the  AF Form 1118 identifying RAC 1, 2 and 3 hazards according to  Attachment 8 and forward to the supervisor for posting not later than the end of the next duty day. The control number for the AF Form 1118 will be assigned by the host wing safety office. This will ensure the control number is compatible with  the associated AF  Form 3 should it become required.  A copy of the AF  Form 1118  will  be  sent  to  the  host  wing  safety  office  by  the  office  assigning  the  RAC.  Supervisors must alert all affected employees and contractors of the hazardous condition, any interim control measures  and permanent corrective  actions underway or programmed. Supervisors post the AF Form 1118 in the workplace immediately upon receipt. AF Form 979, Danger Tag, may be used for this purpose on equipment. Refer to AFI 91-203 for additional guidance. (T-2) 12.8.1.  Location. Post AF Form 1118 on, at or as near as possible to the hazard. However, where the nature of the hazard or workplace is such that this is not practical, post notices in a prominent  place  where  all  employees  can  see  them.  The  workplace  supervisor  must  ensure the posted AF Form 1118 is maintained in good condition and employees are kept informed of any changes. If adverse conditions are present, enclose the notice in a suitable protective cover. (T-2) 12.8.2.  Removal. The issuing office will be the authority to remove a posted AF Form 1118, Notice of Hazard. Removal of notices will only occur after the hazard has been corrected, or three  (3)  working  days  (excluding  weekends  and  federal  holidays),  whichever  is  later, following validation by the issuing authority. (T-2) 12.9.  Installation  Master  Hazard  Abatement  Plan  (MHAP).  Commanders/Functional Managers  will  ensure  all  identified  RAC  1,  2  and  3  hazards  are  entered  into  the  formal installation MHAP. (T-2) 12.9.1.  Those RAC 1, 2 or 3 hazards will be entered on an AF Form 3 IAW Attachment 9. Safety,  fire  or  health  officials  assist  functional  managers  in  preparation  of  the  AF  Form  3. After  commander/functional  manager  approves  and  signs  the  AF  Form  3,  send  to  the installation safety office. (T-2) 12.9.2.  The  host  installation  safety  staff  maintains  the  installation  MHAP.  The  MHAP consists of the following: 12.9.2.1.  A fiscal year log of all RAC 1, 2 and 3 items. 12.9.2.2.  A complete set of AF Form 3s and AF Form 1118s from across the installation. 12.9.2.3.  Other related or supporting documentation. 12.9.2.4.  The signed approval called for in paragraph  12.9.5 or a cross reference to the appropriate  ESOHC  minutes  if  the  option  is  used  to  track  commander  approval  via  the ESOHC. 12.9.3.  Squadron commanders or functional managers will conduct a semiannual review of AF Form 3s pertaining to their areas of responsibilities and reflect that review in Block 22 of the AF Form 3. (T-2) AFI91-202  24 JUNE 2015 125 12.9.3.1.  Commanders/functional managers notify the safety personnel of any changes in hazard abatement status and annotate changes on the AF Form 3. 12.9.3.2.  Completed  hazard  abatement  projects  must  be  certified  by  the  appropriate agency; safety, fire, or health, to ensure the hazard was abated properly. Certification in this particular instance means the appropriate official has performed a site visit to verify the hazard has been fully abated. (T-2) 12.9.4.  The ESOHC will review open MHAP items at least once a  year. They will address project delays and other problems during each ESOHC. The ESOHC minutes will reflect the review and delays or problems respectively. (T-2) 12.9.5.  Annually,  the  COS  will  send  a  written  copy  of  the  MHAP  to  the  installation commander  for  review  and  approval  of  priorities  for  projects.  The  copy  sent  to  the commander will include a cover letter addressing the purpose of the review and description of the request for the commander’s review and signature. The package will include a list of all  open  plan  entries  and  those  closed  since  the  last  annual  review.  The  open  list  will  be prioritized  by  RAC  and  Abatement  Priority  number  (APN).  See  Attachment  7.  Note:  Locations utilizing the AF and MAJCOM/FOA/DRU level Risk models which are included in scheduled Facilities Boards (FBs) and ESOHC meets the intent of this paragraph and that of Attachment 12. 9.2.4. (T-2)  12.9.6.  The  host  safety  office  will  make  the  MHAP  available  for  review  locally  by representatives of recognized employee organizations, if such organizations exist. (T-2) 12.9.7.  MAJCOM/FOA/DRU  ground  safety  personnel  will  send  copies  of  AF  Form  3s received from subordinate installations or units to HQ AFSEC/SEG and AFMOA/ SG3P or AFCEC/DF,  if  appropriate,  when  MAJCOM  funding  authority  for  abatement  action  is exceeded. 12.9.8.  RAC 4 and 5 hazards are not part of the installation MHAP. Safety staffs, including tenant  units,  will  track  RAC  4  and  5  hazards  until  closed.  AF  Form  3 or  AF  Form  1118  is optional  for  RACs  4  and  5.  MAJCOM/FOA/DRU  may  delineate  additional  tracking requirements. 12.9.9.  Once a hazard is transferred to the MHAP (RACs 1 – 3) or the RAC 4 and 5 tracking mechanism, close out applicable source hazard report or inspection report. (T-2) 12.10.  Funding  for  Hazard  Abatement.  Funding  for  hazard  abatement  projects  should  be entered into the Planning, Programming and Budget process. Hazard abatement projects should compete  for  the  necessary  funds  within  the  planning,  programming,  and  budgeting  system framework. 12.10.1.  Incorporate  safety,  fire  and  health  requirements  into  repair  and  construction projects.  For  projects  that  exceed  local  funding  authority,  follow  requirements  in  AFI  32-1021,  Planning  and  Programming  Military  Construction  (MILCON)  Projects,  or  AFI  32-1032,  Planning  and  Programming  Appropriated  Fund  Maintenance,  Repair,  and Construction  Projects,  as  applicable,  and  send  projects  to  the  parent  MAJCOM  for centralized  programming.  Identify  the  portion  of  project  cost  attributable  to  hazard abatement. (T-2) 126 AFI91-202  24 JUNE 2015 12.10.2.  Civil Engineering provides actual cost data for abatement of hazards in workplaces and  real  property  installed  equipment  to  the  functional  manager.  The  functional  manager consolidates the information and sends it to the installation safety staff at least once a year for centralized reporting. (T-2) 12.11.  End  of  Year  Annual  Hazard  Abatement  Survey  Report.  At  the  beginning  of  each new  fiscal  year  AFSEC/SEG  will  send  a  data  call  for  the  end  of  year  hazard  abatement information required to complete the DoD report called for within DoDI 6055.01. This data call will be sent to each MAJCOM/FOA/DRU for subsequent distribution to their subordinate units that  serve  as  the  host  installation  safety  office.  Each  host  installation  safety  manager  obtains information  from  installation  civil  engineering  and  functional  managers  in  order  to  submit  the data  call  back  to  their  higher  headquarters,  who  will,  in  turn,  compile  the  results  and  send  the composite product back to AFSEC/SEG within the suspense date assigned.  FOAs and DRUs are not  to  submit  the  annual  survey  report  if  the  host  installation  reports  their  hazard  abatement actions  through  a  MAJCOM.  At  joint  bases  where  the  Air  Force  is  not  the  lead,  the  Air  Force office  will  complete  the  data  sheet  to  reflect  only  the  Air  Force  specific  hazards  on  the installation Master Hazard Abatement Plan or its equivalent.

 24 JUNE 2015 141 Air  Force  Hazard  Communication  Program  (AFHCP)—Implementation  of  the  Hazard Communication  Standard  (29  CFR  1910.1200)  and  AFI  90-821,  Hazard  Communication.  The purpose of the AFHCP is to reduce the incidence of chemically induced illnesses and injuries. It informs  employees  of  the  hazards  and  proper  preventive  measures  to  be  taken  when  using  or handling hazardous materials in the workplace. Air  Force  Occupational  Safety  and  Health  (AFOSH)—-An  overarching  term  for  the  Air Force Occupational Safety and Health Program. Air  Force  Occupational  Safety  and  Health  (AFOSH)  Standards—-48-series  written standards prescribing occupational health guidance. Air Force Safety Management System (AFSMS)—It is the framework upon which the USAF mishap  prevention  program  is  built.  Provides  organizations  with  an  effective  framework  for continual improvement of safety performance. It enables organizations ability to minimize risks and  reduce  the  occurrence  and  cost  of  injuries,  illnesses,  fatalities  and  property  damage.  The system requires goal setting, planning, executing and measuring performance to be successful. Air  Reserve  Component  (ARC)—Used  when  referring  to  both  the  AFRC  and  ANG  as  one entity. All units, organizations, and members of the ANG and AFRC (10 U.S.C. 261) on active duty,  on  active  duty  for  training,  or  in  drill  status,  and  ANG  and  AFRC  technicians;  include ANG and AFRC property and equipment. Annual Safety Inspection—Method to identify workplace/facility hazards used by safety staffs at the wing and below level. These are conducted by qualified safety personnel annually on all workplaces and facilities. Annual Safety Management Review—An examination of the mishap prevention program at all levels of execution to evaluate the safety management system and the performance of programs or elements managed within the system. The review is performed by senior leadership and safety professionals  to  ensure  the  system  continues  to  be  suitable,  adequate  and  effective  for  its intended purposes, and for making decisions or authorizing actions that need to be taken by staff to ensure the continuous improvement of one or more of its programs or elements. Area  of  Responsibility  (AOR)—Theater of operations for Combatant Command missions and operations  such  as  US  Central  Command  (USCENTCOM),  US  Northern  Command (USNORTHCOM), US European Command (USEUCOM), US Pacific Command (USPACOM) or US Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM). Convening Authority—The individual who has the authority to order a safety investigation. For additional guidance, refer to AFI 91-204. Critical/Imminent Danger—Conditions or practices in a workplace which could reasonably be expected  to  cause  death  or  severe  physical  harm  immediately  or  before  such  dangers  can  be eliminated through  normal  abatement  procedures.  RAC  1  hazards  are  classified  as critical/imminent danger. Days  Away,  Restricted,  and/or  Transfer  Case  Incidence  Rate—The  rate  of  all  civilian injuries  and  illnesses  resulting  in  days  away  from  work,  restricted  work  activity,  and/or  job transfer. This rate is calculated for a work site for a specified period of time (usually one year). Department of Defense Civilian Personnel—Includes Senior Executive Service (SES), General Schedule (GS), National Security Personnel System (NSPS) and federal wage system employees, 142 AFI91-202  24 JUNE 2015 including ANG and AFRC technicians, unless in military duty status. Includes non-appropriated fund  employees  who  are  not  military  personnel  working  part  time;  Corps  of  Engineers  Civil Works  employees;  Youth  Opportunity  Program  (YOP)  and  student  assistance  program employees; Direct-Hire Foreign-national civilians employed by the Air Force (Air Force Foreign Nationals [AFFN]) and Army-Air Force Exchange Service employees. Department  of  the  Air  Force  Military  Personnel—These  are  Air  Force  personnel  on  active duty with the Air Force or ANG and AFRC personnel on military duty status. Includes Air Force Academy  cadets;  also  includes  Reserve  Officer  Training  Corps  (ROTC)  cadets  engaged  in directed training activities. Includes members of other US military services serving on extended active duty with the Air Force or foreign-national military personnel assigned to the Air Force. Designated  Employee  Representative—An  individual  selected  by  civilian  employees,  either directly  or  through  an  exclusive  representation  bargaining  agreement,  to  represent  them  as  a member of the safety and environmental councils and to take part in other activities as outlined in this instruction. Evaluations—Method  of  appraising the  effectiveness  of  mishap  prevention  program management. Addresses the areas of commander supervisory support, compliance with program directives and the effectiveness of mishap prevention programs (performance). Exemption—Grants permanent relief from a requirement. Fire  Hazard—A  condition  that  can  cause  a  fire  to  occur.  The  distinction  between  fire  hazard and  fire  safety  deficiency  (FSD)  is  important  because  the  documentation,  reporting,  and correction  procedures  differ  for  each.  Only  fire  hazards  are  included  in  the  Hazard  Abatement Plan and FSDs are managed separately. Fire  Safety  Deficiency  (FSD)—A  condition  which  reduces  fire  safety  below  the  acceptable level, including noncompliance with standards, but by itself cannot cause a fire to occur. A clear distinction between hazards and deficiencies may not always be possible; therefore, the judgment and experience of a qualified fire official must be relied upon. Fire safety deficiencies will not be assigned a RAC. Flexible  Culture—One  of the four sub-cultures that make up an  Informed Culture. A Flexible Culture is a collection of behaviors and beliefs that acknowledge the inevitability of human error and  unsafe  conditions  and  which  allow  quick  and  smooth  reactions  to  address  hazards  before mishaps result. Flight Safety Manager—A civilian assigned to perform Flight Safety Officer duties. Formal Inspection Report—A report with a particular prescribed format. Full-time—Individuals  in  primary  duty  safety  positions.  See  definition  for  safety  and  health officials. Does not include additional duty safety personnel such as USRs and SAFSOs. Functional Managers—The senior operating official at all levels exercising managerial control of  an  activity  or  operation.  This  individual  usually  can  acquire  and  commit  resources  for  the abatement  of  occupational  safety  and  health  hazards.  Functional  managers  are  designated  by MAJCOM/FOA/DRU or installation commanders. Geographically  Separated  Unit  (GSU)—Any  Air  Force  unit  that  is  geographically  separated beyond a reasonable commuting distance from its servicing military personnel flight. AFI91-202  24 JUNE 2015 143 Hazard—A condition, procedure or practice that creates a potential for producing death, injury, illness, fire, property damage, equipment damage or environmental damage. Hazard/Deficiency  Abatement—Eliminating  or  permanently  reducing  a  hazard  by  complying with applicable safety requirements or taking equivalent protective measures. Hazard/Deficiency  Severity—An  assessment  of  the  expected  consequences  if  a  hazard,  if  left unabated, results in a mishap. The Air Force defines severity by the degree of injury, illness, or resource damage that can result from a specific mishap. Hazard Reporting—A process, by which any person assigned, attached or under contract to the Air  Force,  may  report  a  hazard.  This  includes  any  event  or  condition  that  affects  aviation, ground, weapons or space. High Interest Areas—These areas have the greatest risk to life or property damage, experienced repeated mishaps, or in the judgment of the safety office, require added oversight. They can also be  work  areas  or  operations  that  need  additional  attention  or  inspections  because  of  increased mishap potential due to  the nature of work  performed, physical conditions  or type of materials handled. High-Risk Activities—These are activities having a higher potential for personnel injury due to the level of competition, speed, risk, or skills needed and requiring greater agility, stamina and dexterity. Some examples of high-risk activities are flying civil aircraft, hang gliding, skydiving, parasailing,  white-water  rafting,  motorcycling  and  auto  racing,  scuba  diving,  bungee  jumping and  bronco  and  bull  riding.  Note:    MAJCOM/FOA/DRU  can  determine  within  the  command what are considered high risk activities. Informal Report—A report with no particular format. (e.g. spot inspection, high interest) Informed  Culture—A  term  used  to  describe  the  optimal  state  of  an  organization’s  safety culture, in which each individual sees his or her role as a fundamental part of the organization’s commitment  to  safety  and  achievement  of  organizational  safety  goals.  Four  prerequisite  sub-cultures help create an Informed Culture: a Just Culture, a Reporting Culture, a Learning Culture and a Flexible Culture. Inspections—The process  of determining  compliance with  safety  and health standards through physical surveys of workplaces, operations, and facilities. Interim Control Measure—Temporary action taken to reduce the degree of risk associated with a hazard pending completion of an abatement project. Job  Safety  Training  Outline  (JSTO)—An  outline  of  mandatory  safety  training  items  that supervisors  use  when  conducting  workcenter  safety  training  for  their  specific  work  areas.  See Attachment 4.  Joint Activity Service Billet—An activity, operation or organization in which elements of more than  one  Military  Department  of  the  United  States,  as  reflected  in  joint  manpower  programs documents, perform joint  missions under auspices of OSD, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff or the commander of a combatant or combined command. Just Culture—One of the four sub-cultures that make up an Informed Culture. A Just Culture is an organizational environment where front line operators or others are not punished for actions, omissions or decisions taken by them that are commensurate with their experience and training, 144 AFI91-202  24 JUNE 2015 but where gross negligence, willful violations and destructive acts are not tolerated. Just Culture focuses  on  improving  system  designs  and  employee  procedures  to  include:  better  system operations; creating redundant safety systems to trap or mitigate errors; pre-identifying high-risk operations; and leadership actions designed to limit at-risk behaviors. Learning Culture—One of the four sub-cultures that make up an Informed Culture. A Learning Culture  exists  when  an  organization  has  the  willingness  and  ability  to  implement  proper recommendations  from  safety  information  that  is  produced  through  continuous  risk  assessment of hazards. Major  Command—For  the  purpose  of  mishap  prevention  (MAJCOM)  includes  ACC,  AETC, AFMC, AFRC, AFSPC, AFGSC, AFSOC, AMC, ANG, PACAF and USAFE. Major Subsystem—A subsystem to the aircraft without which the mission of the platform could not be accomplished successfully. Major subsystems include, but are not limited to, propulsion, ejection system, radar systems. Military-Unique  Workplaces,  Operations,  Equipment  and  Systems—Military  and  civilian operations, systems and equipment that are unique to the national defense mission and military services.  These  operations,  systems  and  equipment  are  exempted  from  the  scope  of  the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (Title 29, U.S.C., Sections 651-678). An example of the Air Force operations, systems and equipment that are unique to the national defense mission are  military  aircraft,  missiles  and  missile  sites,  early  warning  systems,  military  space  systems, ammunition,  military  flight  operations,  chemical  warfare  gear,  associated  research  test  and development activities, and actions required under emergency conditions. Mishap—A mishap is an unplanned occurrence, or series of occurrences, that results in damage or injury and meets Class A, B, C, D and E mishap reporting criteria IAW AFI 91-204. Multi-Functional Team (MFT)—As defined 63- and 64-series guidance publications, MFT is a team of stakeholders responsible for a Service’s acquisition. It includes not only representatives of the technical and procurement communities, but also stakeholders of the Service’s acquisition and the contractors who provide the services. The team may consist of subgroup(s) responsible for  routine  contract  actions.  The  team  could  be  a  Business  Requirements  Advisory  Group (BRAG),  Mission  Area  Acquisition  Team  (MAAT),  Integrated  Product  Team  (IPT),  working group, an A-76 IPT or Steering Group, etc. National  Consensus  Standards—Standards  published  by  recognized  standards  organizations such  as  the  ANSI,  NFPA,  American  Conference  of  Governmental  Industrial  Hygienists, Compressed Gas Association, and NIOSH. National consensus standards adopted by OSHA are part of OSHA standards. Notice of Hazard—A written warning of a condition, procedure, or practice which constitutes a hazard. As used in the context of this instruction, "Notice of Hazard" refers to AF Form 1118. Occupational  Deficiency—Conditions,  procedures  and  practices  not  compliant  with  OSHA  or AFOSH requirements, but do not, in themselves, create a potential for producing an occupational injury or illness mishap. Deficiencies may, however, create a potential for secondary injuries or illnesses  or  may  contribute  to  the  severity  of  an  injury  or  illness  that  has  already  occurred. Examples  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  program  management  items  or  the  absence  of  an eyewash  stations.  A  clear  distinction  between  hazards  and  deficiencies  may  not  always  be AFI91-202  24 JUNE 2015 145 possible;  therefore,  the  judgment  and  experience  of  qualified  safety,  fire  protection  and  health personnel must be relied upon. Occupational  Hazard—Conditions, procedures, and practices directly related to the workplace that  can  create  a  potential  for  producing  occupational  injuries,  property  or  equipment  damage, mission degradation, damage to the environment, or illnesses. Performance Appraisal—A systematic comparison of an employee’s performance of duties and responsibilities with performance standards. Quality Assurance Personnel—Individuals designated to perform quality assessment functions, and  manage  performance  in  accordance  with  the  Performance  Plan.  They  serve  as  on-site technical  managers  assessing  contractor  performance  against  contract  performance  standards. Personnel  in  this  area  have  many  titles,  such  as  Quality  Assurance  Evaluator  (QAE),  Quality Assurance  Specialist  (QAS),  Functional  Area  Evaluators  (FAEs),  and  Contracting  Officer Technical Representative (COTR). Quality Assurance Program Coordinator (QAPC)—Mission support group or AFMC/AFSPC Center-level  individual,  normally  from  the  contracting  activity,  selected  to  coordinate  and manage the Performance Management Assessment Program (Quality Assurance Program). Qualified Safety, Fire Protection, Bioenvironmental Engineering and Health Officials—Air Force civilian and military personnel assigned to full time positions for the respective disciplines.

Tier/Waiver Tier 0 (T-0)—Determined by respective non-AF authority (e.g., Congress, White House, Office of Secretary of Defense, Joint Staff). The waiver authority is non-applicable, or external to AF. Tier 1 (T-1)—Non-compliance puts Airmen, Commanders or the USAF strongly at risk of mission or program failure, death, injury, legal jeopardy or unacceptable fraud, waste or abuse. The waiver authority is the MAJCOM/CC, delegable no lower than MAJCOM Director, with the concurrence of the AFI Certifying Official. Note:  For acquisition and sustainment program AFI91-202  24 JUNE 2015 147 manager mandates in this instruction, the waiver authority is SAF/AQ (delegate to the PEO-level), with the concurrence of the AFI Certifying Official. Tier 2 (T-2)—Non-compliance may degrade mission or program effectiveness or efficiency and has potential to create moderate risk of mission or program failure, injury, legal jeopardy or unacceptable fraud, waste or abuse. The waiver authority is the MAJCOM/CC (delegable no lower than MAJCOM Director). Note:  For acquisition and sustainment program manager mandates in this instruction, the waiver authority is the PEO for the program. Tier 3 (T-3)—Non-compliance may limit mission or program effectiveness or efficiency and has a relatively remote potential to create risk of mission or program failure, injury, legal jeopardy or unacceptable fraud, waste, or abuse. The waiver authority is the Wing/DRU/FOA/CC (delegable no lower than Group/CC or equivalent). TRiPS (Travel Risk Planning System)—TRiPS program assists in travel planning. TRiPS is accessed through the Air Force portal (https://www.my.af.mil/trips/af/Login.aspx). Total Case Incidence Rate (TCIR)—A number that represents the total recordable civilian injuries and illnesses per 100 full-time employees, calculated for a worksite for a specified period of time (usually one year).  Unit Safety Committee—Organized and maintained to monitor and assist an agency’s safety and health program. The committee assists in helping to maintain an open channel of communication between employees and management in the workplace. The committees provide a method by which employees can utilize their knowledge of workplace operations to assist management with improving policies, conditions, and practices. Note:  The term “team concept” is used synonymously with “safety committee”.  Unit Safety Representative—General term for a person assigned to a unit who is responsible for the additional duty safety responsibilities. May be a representative of flight, ground or weapons, and may include a more specific title such as Additional Duty Weapons Safety Representative (ADWSR) or Squadron Assigned Flight Safety Officer (SAFSO), etc. United States—The several States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealths of Puerto Rico and the Northern Marina Islands, American Samoa, Guam, Midway and Wake Islands, the United States Virgin Islands, any other territory or possession of the United States, and associated navigable waters, contiguous zones, and ocean waters of which the natural resources are under the exclusive management authority of the United States. Urgent Action Notice—Significant event notifications sent out by the Air Force Service Watch Center (AFSWC). These notifications are also called AFSWC notifications.  Variance—An approved temporary or permanent change to a procedure, criterion, or rule prescribed in safety standards which provides the same degree of protection to personnel.  Workplace—The physical location where work is performed for the Air Force by Air Force personnel or where Air Force operations take place.  148 AFI91-202  24 JUNE 2015 USAF AVIATION SAFETY EQUIPMENT DATABASE REPORTING Attachment 2 A2.1.

A3.3.  Emergency  Operations  Center  (EOC).  The  EOC  responds  to  peacetime  major accidents and natural  disasters to  provide on-scene command and control of Air Force military resources and functional expertise. The EOC and its members will meet the requirements in AFI 10-2501. Note:  Ideally, the safety representative to the EOC should not be responsible for assembling the interim safety board (ISB). (T-2) A3.4.  Safety  Response  to  Other  than  Major  Peacetime  Accidents.  Some  mishaps  may  not warrant  a  full  activation of  the  Disaster  Response  Force  (DRF).  However,  the  safety  staff  may need some EOC elements to support investigation of these less severe incidents, such as Combat Camera or Civil  Engineering Specialists. Each safety staff should consult with  their supporting readiness  and  emergency  management  flight  to  determine  how  to  formally  provide  for  partial EOC support when the full DRF is not activated. A3.5.  Munitions  Rapid  Response  Team.  The  Air  Force  Life  Cycle  Management  Center Munitions Sustainment Division (AFLCMC/EBH) has developed a conventional munitions rapid response  team  to  support  Air  Force  units  throughout  the  world  anytime  a  munitions  incident occurs.  The  team  includes  experts  (engineers,  equipment  specialists,  program  managers  and safety personnel) from associated conventional munitions programs. These personnel are able to travel anywhere in the world within 24 to 48 hours to assist in determining the cause of failure. If your  MAJCOM/FOA/DRU  or  unit  has  an  incident,  and  this  team’s  help  is  desired,  contact  the AFLCMC  Munitions  Operations  and  Readiness  Branch  (AFLCMC/EBHM)  via  the  Global Ammunition  Control  Point  (GACP)  Customer  Relationship  Management  (CRM)  System  at https://www.my.af.mil/ammoprod/wm/ to request support or by calling DSN 312-777-AMMO (2666); DSN 312-775-AMMO (2666); Commercial 801-777-AMMO (2666) or 801-775-AMMO (2666).  AFI91-202  24 JUNE 2015 151 Attachment 4 JOB SAFETY TRAINING OUTLINE (JSTO) A4.1.

For example, what is done first, what is done next? You can do this by: (1) observing the task, (2) discussing it with workers, (3) using your experience and knowledge of the task, or (4) a combination of all three. Record the steps in the task in their normal order of occurrence. Describe what is done; not the details  or  how  it  is  done.  Three  or  four  words  are  normally  enough  to  describe  each  task  step.  (T-3) A5.2.  Potential  Mishap  Causes  Or  Hazards:  For  each  task  step,  ask  yourself  what  mishap could  happen  to  workers  performing  the  task  and  what  the  probability  would  be  of  the mishap occurring. Get the answers by: (1) observing the task, (2) discussing the task with workers and/or (3) using “lessons learned” from other mishaps. Ask the questions: (T-3) A5.2.1.  Can workers be struck by or contacted by anything? A5.2.2.  Can they strike against or be exposed to any item that can cause injury? A5.2.3.  Can they be caught in or between anything? A5.2.4.  Can they fall? A5.2.5.  Can they overexert themselves? A5.2.6.  Are they required to do repetitive lifting or heavy lifting? A5.2.7.  Are there potential hazards such as chemical substances, physical agents (including noise,  ergonomic  and  thermal  stress),  ionizing  and  non-ionizing  radiation  or  biological exposures? A5.3.  Recommended  Safe  Task  Procedure:  For  each  potential  mishap  cause  or  hazard identified, consider the following questions: A5.3.1.  How  should  workers  perform  the  task  step  to  avoid  the  mishap  or  eliminate  the potential hazard? A5.3.2.  What can be done to eliminate or mitigate the hazard by redesigning the work area or equipment? A5.3.3.  How  can  the  procedure  be  modified  to  eliminate  the  hazard?  Note:    Be  sure  to describe in detail the precautions workers must take and ensure that these steps are placed in the task procedure or checklist. Take special care to ensure important steps or details are not inadvertently omitted from the task and that guidance is clear, specific and easily understood by workers. Table A5.1.

Those are addressed in MIL- STD-882E. Note:  AF Bioenvironmental Engineering will refer to the latest version of DoDI 6055.01, DoD Safety and Occupational Health (SOH) Program, Appendix to Enclosure 3 – Determining RACs, to determine appropriate health RACs. Note:  This attachment is not for use to determine Fire Safety Deficiencies. Fire Safety Deficiencies are addressed in AFI 32-10141, Planning and Programming Fire Safety Deficiency Correction Projections. A6.1.  Risk Assessment Codes are an expression of the degree of risk associated with a hazard or occupational  deficiency  that  combines  hazard  severity  and  mishap  probability  into  a  single numeric identifier. RACs are tools used by fire, safety and health professionals and commanders to  prioritize  abatement  plans  and  mitigate  hazards.  It  may  not  be  possible  to  assign  a  RAC  to every  hazard  or  circumstance  and  the  lack  of  a  RAC  should  not  dissuade  efforts  to  mitigate hazards. A6.1.1.  This  instruction  describes  the  basic  RACs  and  provides  some  guidelines  for assigning  priorities  based  on  cost,  effectiveness  and  exposure.  The  discipline  specific chapters also provide additional guidance for assessing the risks of the applicable hazards. A6.1.2.  Risk  Assessment  Codes.  Only  qualified  occupational  safety,  fire  protection  and health personnel shall assign a RAC to each hazard after an evaluation of the concern. There are  two  methods  for  calculating  RACs.  Which  method  is  used  depends  on  what  type  of hazard is present. Safety, fire and ergonomic hazards use one calculation method and health-related hazards use another. (T-2)  A6.2.  Safety, fire and ergonomic RACs are determined by plotting the probability (A, B, C or D) that a mishap will occur and the potential mishap severity (I, II, III or IV) if it does happen (Table A6.1). Fire safety deficiencies will not be assigned a RAC. Fire safety deficiencies are addressed in AFI 32-10141, Planning and Programming Fire Safety Deficiency Correction Projects.  A6.3.  Health-related  RACs  are  determined  by  plotting  the  health  hazard  severity  and  illness probability categories (Table A6.8). A6.3.1.  Health  Hazard  Severity  Category  (HHSC).  The  HHSC  reflects  the  magnitude  of exposure  to  a  single  physical,  chemical,  or  biological  agent  and  the  medical  effects  of exposure. A6.3.1.1.  Determine the HHSC by totaling the exposure and medical effects points and use the following table: (T-2)  A6.3.2.  Illness Probability Category (IPC). The IPC is a function of the duration of exposure and the number of exposed personnel. A6.3.2.1.  Determine  the  IPC  for  health  hazards  by  totaling  the  exposure  duration  and number of personnel exposed points and use the following guide: (T-2)  AFI91-202  24 JUNE 2015 157 A6.4.  Commanders  will  consider  this  RAC  system  when  determining  which  hazards/ deficiencies warrant the expenditure of limited resources. (T-2)  A6.5.  Assigned RACs will continue to be tracked in the installation hazard abatement plan until completely abated even when interim control measures are in place. (T-2) Table A6.1.

The  abatement  priority  number  (APN)  is  a  two-part  code:  the  RAC  and  the  cost effectiveness  index  (CEI).  CEI  measures  cost  effectiveness  of  a  hazard  abatement  project  and represents  a  ratio  of  the  project  cost  and  its  potential  effectiveness.  The  APN  will  be  used  to determine  the  relative  priority  of  abatement  actions.  Use  the  APN  in  establishing  funding priorities for hazard abatement projects during the budgetary cycle. Compute APN: (T-2) A7.1.1.  Step 1. Determine RAC from Table A6.1, based on mishap severity and probability of occurrence. A7.1.2.  Step 2. Determine the severity probability multiplier (M) from the matrix in  Table A7.1, using the same severity and probability used to determine the RAC. Table A7.1.  Severity and Probability Multiplier Matrix. Note:  The multipliers in table represent a proportional distribution of the severity and frequency of mishaps.   A7.1.3.  Step 3. Determine exposure (E), or the average number of personnel exposed daily to the hazard during the course of the year. A7.1.4.  Step 4. Determine the total abatement project cost (C). If actual costs are not known, use best available estimate. A7.1.5.  Step 5. Compute the CEI by dividing the C for abatement by the product of M and E, or CEI = C/ (M) (E). A7.1.6.  Step 6. Determine APN by listing the RAC followed by the CEI in  parenthesis,  or APN = RAC (CEI). A7.1.7.  Step  7.  Determine  relative  priority  of  abatement  projects  by  comparing  the  CEI  of projects  within  identical  RACs.  Note:    The  lower  the  CEI,  the  higher  its  relative  priority within the same RAC. A7.2.  To use APNs to establish a priority list of projects, follow these steps: (T-2) A7.2.1.  Step  1.  Determine  RAC.  Assumptions:  Given  a  hazard  that  will  probably  occur  in time (Probability B) and would result in a permanent partial disabling injury (Severity II) if it resulted in a mishap. Therefore, the assigned RAC from Table A6.1 would be 2. AFI91-202  24 JUNE 2015 161 A7.2.2.  Step 2. Determine multiplier (M). Plot mishap probability (B) versus hazard severity (II) on Table A7.1 to obtain a multiplier of 21. A7.2.3.  Step 3. Determine exposure (E). Assumption: The functional manager or supervisor determined that on an average day 25 people are exposed to the hazard. A7.2.4.  Step 4. Determine the total cost of project (C). Example: The total cost of the project to abate the hazard as provided to the functional manager by Civil Engineering is $2,100. A7.2.5.  Step 5. Determine CEI. CEI = C/ (M) (E); (M) (E) = 21x25, therefore CEI = 2100/ (21) (25) = 4. A7.2.6.  Step 6. Determine APN. APN will be (RAC) (CEI) = (2) (4). A7.2.7.  Step  7.  Determine  relative  priority.  The  APN  will  now  be  used  to  prioritize  this project  in  relation  to  other  RAC  2s  for  which  APNs  have  been  computed.  A  hypothetical priority listing containing this project is shown in table A7.2. Table A7.2.  Abatement Priority Number Index.

The Pre-Departure Travel Safety Program is a recommended management tool for commanders  and supervisors.  It  helps  military  and civilian  employees on orders, especially those under the age of 26, reduce the potential for a traffic mishap by identifying and mitigating risks involving travel by private motor vehicle for leave, PCS and temporary duty assignments. A10.2.  Overview.  Commanders,  managers  and  supervisors  will  help  guide  and  mentor employees in applying personal RM when planning for a trip. Consider the following factors to guide the discussion on assessing risk and identifying mitigating strategies, but also consider and address other factors based on the unique nature of each situation. This interactive briefing may be  documented  on  AF  Form  4392,  Pre-Departure  Safety  Briefing  Form.  Another  tool  for commanders  and  supervisors  to  consider  is  use  of  the  Travel  Risk  Planning  System  (TRiPS) program  to  assist  in travel  planning for all personnel.  TRiPS is accessed  through the Air Force portal (https://trips.safety.army.mil/). A10.2.1.  Urge  the  driver  to  carefully  and  thoroughly  plan  the  trip,  allowing  time  for  rest prior to departure and to take a break at least every two hours. A10.2.2.  Travelers  are  not  to  drive  more  than  10  hours  during  any  24-hour  period. Motorcyclists are highly encouraged to travel fewer hours. Highly recommend that travelers get a good night’s sleep (7-8 hours) while traveling. A10.2.3.  Airmen  must  ensure  they  have  sufficient  funds  available  to  cover  expenses  (a shortage of funds often leads to exhausting, marathon driving). (T-3) A10.2.4.  Travelers  must  check  the  weather  forecast  and  road  conditions  for  the  intended route of travel. (T-3) A10.2.5.  Discourage  driving  during  late  night  hours.  Remind  the  traveler  that  there  is  a greater chance to encounter impaired (intoxicated, fatigued) drivers on the road at night than during the day. A10.2.6.  Stress  the  value  of  occupant  restraint  devices  (mandatory  for  military  personnel), including  child  restraints  and  the  use  of  helmets  and  personal  protective  equipment  by motorcyclists;  review  the  hazard  of  reduced  visibility  due  to  factors  such  as  darkness, weather,  sun  glare;  and  touch  on  the  issue  of  being  alert  for  road  hazards  such  as  animals crossing the roadway, stalled or slow-moving vehicles, and so forth. A10.2.7.  Stress  the  importance  of  vehicle  condition  —  vehicle  defects  also  contribute  to mishaps. A10.2.8.  Discuss  the main causes of injury  and death  by vehicle mishaps in  the Air Force, which include speeding or excessive speed for conditions, fatigue, inattention or distraction, not wearing seatbelts and the effects of medication and alcohol. A10.3.  Additional  Information.  Advise  the  member  to  contact  their  unit  commander,  first sergeant, flight commander, immediate supervisor or command post in the event of a mishap or if  an  emergency  situation  arises.  Ensure  the  individual  is  provided  the  phone  numbers  of  the points of contact. AFI91-202  24 JUNE 2015 167 Attachment 11 AIR FORCE OFF-DUTY HIGH-RISK ACTIVITIES PROGRAM A11.1.  Purpose.  The  Off-duty  High  Risk  Activity  (HRA)  Program  is  a  recommended management  tool  for  commanders  and  supervisors.  The  intent  of  the  program  is  to  ensure participants  are  familiar  with  the  hazards  and  injury  potential  associated  with  their  particular activity. This program is intended for military personnel only. A11.2.  High-Risk  Activities.  These are activities having a higher potential for personal injury due to the level of competition, speed, risk or skills needed and requiring greater agility, stamina and  dexterity.  Some  examples  of  high-risk  activities  are  flying  civil  aircraft,  hang  gliding, skydiving,  parasailing,  white-water  rafting,  motorcycle  and  auto  racing,  scuba  diving,  bungee jumping, bronco and bull riding, and extreme sports or any activity identified by the commander. Note:   MAJCOM/FOA/DRU can determine within the command what are considered high risk activities. A11.3.  Commander’s/Supervisor’s  Responsibility.  Commanders  or  supervisors  will  ensure all  personnel  are  briefed  about  the  HRA  program  regardless  of  their  participation  in  high-risk activities. Each individual should be surveyed and if it is determined they are actively engaged or about  to  engage  in  an  HRA  they  should  meet  one  on  one  with  their  commander  or  supervisor. Ideally  implemented,  a  HRA  interview  is  not  a  briefing.  It  is  for  the  purpose  determining  the mental and physical readiness, and situational awareness preparedness of participants before the HRA  occurs.  The  interviewer  can  discuss  with  the  interviewee  the  risks  of  the  activities  and ascertain  some  idea  of  the  likelihood  that  the  participant  can  enjoy  the  activity  without  an unacceptable  level  of  risk.  Through  this  process  the  interviewer  can  determine  such  things  as level  of  experience,  knowledge  of  PPE  requirements,  physical  safety  aspects  of  the  area  of participation, level of supervision or oversight by qualified professional staffs or officials, rules or recommended practices of professional organizations, and so on. It is also a chance to discuss the  mental  and  physical  preparedness  of  the  participant.  If  interviewers  determine  participants are  not  adequately  trained  or  are  inexperienced,  they  should  encourage  participants  to  seek additional  training  through  a  nationally  recognized  institute  before  participating  in  the  activity. (T-3) A11.4.  Individual Responsibility.  Individuals planning to engage in high-risk activities such as those  described  in  paragraph    A11.2,  will  be  encouraged  to  inform  his  or  her  immediate supervisor,  and  schedule  an  interview  their  supervisor,  squadron  commander  or  designee.  The individual  engaging  in  a  high-risk  activity  is  responsible  for  applying  sound  RM  practices  to avoid jeopardizing life or limbs and their ability to perform their Air Force duties. (T-3) A11.5.  Documentation.  AF  Form  4391,  High-Risk  Activities  Worksheet,  may  be  used  to document  the  briefing,  completed  by  the  squadron  commander,  individual’s  supervisor,  safety officer or training manager.  168 AFI91-202  24 JUNE 2015 Attachment 12 CONTINUING EDUCATION AND TRAINING COURSES Table A12.1.

A risk assessment succinctly documents the results of several steps in the risk management process and supports follow-on decision-making processes (reference AFI 90-802,  Risk  Management,  AFPAM  90-803,  Risk  Management  Guidelines  and  Tools,  and  AF Form  4437,  Deliberate  Risk  Assessment  Worksheet).  Decision  options  typically  involve determining  whether  one  or  more  particular  courses  of  action  should  be  pursued  (e.g., implementing  equipment  improvements,  safety  or  warning  device  improvements,  operational improvements,  technical  improvements,  policy  improvements),  or  whether  a  risk  should  be accepted.  A  risk  assessment  supports  decision-making  processes  by  objectively  identifying  a hazard, assessing its risk, thoroughly analyzing potential options for risk mitigation and making a recommendation.  Note:    The  term  “losses,”  also  include  fatalities,  not  just  system  losses.  A suggested risk assessment is show in Figure  A15.1 below. Figure A15.1.  Sample Risk Assessment Layout. Risk Assessment Title Background:  Broadly describe the situation being evaluated. Provide sufficient detail so the remainder of the risk assessment may be easily understood. Hazard Identification:  Hazards are defined as any real or potential condition that can cause mission degradation, illness or injury to personnel or damage to or loss of equipment or property. Accurately and succinctly describe the hazard (e.g., deficiency with engineering design, material, quality, software, operations, maintenance) being analyzed. Initial Risk:  The first assessment of the potential risk associated with an identified hazard.  Risk is the probability and severity of loss from exposure to the hazard. Risk assessment is the application of qualitative and quantitative measures to determine the level of risk associated with the identified hazard. Identify the probability and severity of a mishap that could result from the hazard, based upon the exposure of personnel or assets to the identified hazard.  Use the baseline or “as designed” state as the basis for determining the initial risk. Fully explain the methodology used, data considered (e.g., reported mishaps/events, deficiency reports, test results, etc) and rationale for determining the baseline for measuring risk. Interim Risk:  Many times initial mitigation steps have already been taken prior to the completion of a written risk assessment. These steps may include permanent risk mitigation measures or temporary stop-gap risk mitigation measures. Describe these measures and explain how the baseline risk is being mitigated, their effectiveness and the resulting interim risk until final risk mitigating options can be implemented. Risk Mitigation Options:  It is likely several options still exist to mitigate the risk of the identified hazard. Effective control measures reduce or eliminate one of the three components (i.e., probability, severity or exposure) of risk. Investigate specific strategies and tools that reduce, mitigate or eliminate risk. Address each risk mitigation option separately. One option to always consider is “taking no further action” which is the equivalent of accepting the baseline risk and acknowledging and accepting expected future losses. For each option, including accepting the baseline risk, address: Description: Describe the option being evaluated. AFI91-202  24 JUNE 2015 175 Impact:  Describe the impact of this option. What are its benefits; limitations? Address its effectiveness and explain how it will eliminate or control future losses. Does it address other hazards/problems or introduce new ones? Cost:  Estimate the costs (i.e., financial, operational, maintenance) to implement this option. Schedule:  Estimate schedule implement this option. Target Risk:  Describe the risk level the PM intends to achieve by implementing mitigation measures. Residual Risk:  This is the risk that remains after all mitigations have been implemented.  Residual risk may be above, below, or the same as the target risk.  Great risk mitigation options eliminate hazards and their risk entirely; others only reduce the risk. Assuming this risk mitigation option is implemented; identify the probability and severity of a mishap that could result from the hazard based upon the exposure of personnel or assets to the identified hazard. Fully explain the methodology used (including analytical assumptions and limitations), data considered, and rationale for determining the residual risk. Expected Future Losses:  Estimate the expected losses with implementation of this option. Express losses over a period of time, a number of events or for a given population. Fully explain the methodology used, data considered and rationale for determining these expected losses. Summary of Options:  If the number of risk mitigation options is lengthy, a tabular summary may be appropriate. Include, as necessary.  Recommendation:  State the recommended courses of action, including rationale.  176 AFI91-202  24 JUNE 2015 Attachment 16 SAFETY RELEASE A16.1.  Requirement. A16.1.1.  The PM shall provide a safety release  for the system prior to  each developmental and operational test involving personnel.  (T-3) The safety release must identify the hazards involved  in  the  test  and  their  formal  risk  acceptance.  (T-3)  A  Safety  Release  provides  the Test  and  Evaluation  community  the  known  system-related  Environment,  Safety  and Occupational  Health  (ESOH)  hazards  prior  to  exposing  people,  equipment  or  the environment.  The  safety  release  must  transmit  system  ESOH  hazard  data  to  the  operators, maintainers,  trainers  and  testers.  (T-3)  Test  organizations  use  the  safety  release  and  other relevant  data,  documents  and  expertise  to  assess,  further  mitigate  and  accept  test  risks  as appropriate.  Refer  to  the  Defense  Acquisition  Guidebook,  DoDI  5000.02,  MIL-STD-882E, and  AFMAN  63-119  for  additional  information.  As  a  minimum,  the  safety  release  will contain: (T-1) A16.1.1.1.  Known hazards and mitigation actions/measures identified and tracked by the program office (e.g., master hazard list, Safety Assessment Report, SSG tracked hazards, previous test identified hazards, airworthiness analysis/certificates). A16.1.1.2.  A cover letter or equivalent by the PM stating the item/system is safe to test given known hazards and mitigating measures, signed by the appropriate acquisition risk acceptance authority (A16.1.2). A16.1.2.  The  PM  shall  document  that  the  associated  risks  have  been  accepted  by  the appropriate acquisition acceptance authorities as specified in DoDI 5000.02.

Annually  reviewing  safety  programs  and  analyzing  results  is  essential  to  successful execution  of  the  mishap  prevention  program  under  the  Safety  Management  System  (SMS) construct.  It  allows  MAJCOM  and  below  safety  staff  to  identify  areas  for  continual improvement, correct identified weaknesses and prioritize factors related to implementation. This analysis and resulting adjustments to the safety program should improve the program processes and procedures, reduce risk exposure, and consequently, decrease the frequency and/or severity of mishaps. A17.1.1.  The APMR provides senior leaders with a clear picture of the effectiveness of their safety  function  as  well  as  its  impact  on  the  mission  of  the  organization.  The  review  will contain a statement declaring the mishap prevention program conformance and performance under  the  systemic  processes  of  the  AFSMS  was  either  met  and  effective,  met  but  needs minor improvement(s), met but needs significant improvement(s), or was not effective. (T-1)  A17.1.2.  The  objective  of  the  APMR  is  to  demonstrate  leadership  within  a  safety  program from  reactionary  one-time  fixes  to  long-term  solutions. While  statistical  products  related  to mishap trend analysis, hazard reporting and abatement are already a staple of the Air Force Mishap Prevention Program, other elements of the annual review may be new. The long-term strategy is  to  provide a  near  completely  automated analysis capability within an  IT system, like the Air Force Safety Automated System (AFSAS), as resources permit. A key feature of the SMS is both internal and external programmatic assessments with a scorecard to ensure continuous  improvement.  (T-1)  The  internal  self-assessment  scorecard  tool  for  the  AFSMS will be the Annual AFSMS Management Review as described in this attachment. (T-1) A17.2.  Minimum Required Elements of the APMR: (T-1) A17.2.1.  Executive Summary. A17.2.1.1.  A brief overview of how the organization’s activities fit into the SMS concept and structure. A17.2.1.2.
