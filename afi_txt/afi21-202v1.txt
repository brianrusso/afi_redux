Air  Force  Instruction  (AFI)  21-200,  Munitions  and Missile Maintenance.    AFI 21-200 contains  general  information  to  support  Air  Force  munitions  and  missile  maintenance  and provides broad responsibilities for these organizations.  This AFI is the capstone document that defines  missile  maintenance  organizational  structure,  related  roles  and  responsibilities,  and  is supported by a family of 21-2XX series instructions, which includes AFI 21-202. 1.2.  Introduction.  This  instruction  prescribes  specific  missile  maintenance  guidance  and procedures and provides senior leadership and management direction for the accomplishment of this mission.  This AFI refers to ICBM maintenance. 1.3.  Supervision of Maintenance.  All levels of supervision place emphasis on safety, security, quality, and timeliness in the performance of maintenance. 1.4.  Missile  and  Equipment  Readiness.  Missile  and  equipment  readiness  is  the  maintenance mission. Maintenance ensures assigned missiles and support equipment are safe, serviceable and properly configured to meet mission needs.  Maintenance actions include, but are not limited to, certification, inspection, repair, overhaul, modification, preservation, refurbishment, testing, and analyzing condition and performance. 1.5.  Nuclear  Certification  Program.  Manage  nuclear-certified  equipment,  software,  vehicles and  end  items  identified  in  USAF  Master  Nuclear  Certification  List  per  AFI  63-125,  Nuclear Certification Program listed in https://wwwmil.nwc.kirtland.af.mil/MNCL/menu.cfm.  1.6.  Weapon  System  Support  Equipment.  Weapon  System  Support  Equipment  (SE)  is specifically designed for weapon system operations. Requests for SE for operations not directed by weapon system technical orders (TO) must be approved in advance.  (T-1). 1.6.1.  Forward detailed requests, to include item nomenclature, serial number, intended use and  any  specific  information  on  configuration  changes  or  expected  failure  modes  to applicable MAJCOM logistics division for evaluation.  (T-2). 1.7.  Preventive  Maintenance.  The  purpose  of  the  entire  maintenance  process  is  to  sustain  a capability  to  support  operational  mission  requirements.    To  accomplish  this  objective,  the primary  focus  of  the  maintenance  effort  should  be  on  preventive  rather  than  corrective maintenance.  Preventive (or scheduled) maintenance ensures equipment  is  ready  and available at the time of need.  A conscientious and disciplined approach to preventive maintenance will be the method used to meet that goal safely and effectively.  Preventive maintenance concepts are described  in  TO  00-20-1,  Aerospace  Equipment  Maintenance  Inspection,  Documentation, Policies, and Procedures. 1.7.1.  Maintenance personnel apply the “Find and Fix” concept by identifying discrepancies, making  repairs  within  their  capability,  and  documenting  all  discrepancies  in  Integrated Maintenance  Data  System  (IMDS),  to  include  those  corrected  on-the-spot.    This  ensures system and equipment  issues are detected and corrected in  a timely manner.   Imperfections that do not affect the life or operation of the system (e.g., superficial scuff marks on cables, 8 AFI21-202V1  18 JANUARY 2017 minor paint chips, insignificant key way slippage, and small scratches on equipment drawers) do  not  constitute  discrepancies  and  should  not  be  documented  (consider  form,  fit  or function). 1.8.  ICBM  Maintenance  Management.  ICBM  and  equipment  readiness  is  the  maintenance mission. All maintenance actions and management efforts must be directed towards the support of  the  United  States  Strategic  Command  (USSTRATCOM)  requirements.    All  levels  of supervision  must  place  emphasis  on  safety,  quality  and  timeliness  in  the  performance  of maintenance.    Maintenance  supervisors  are  mandated  to  use  all  resources  in  the  most  effective and  efficient  way  with  emphasis  on  the  safety  and  welfare  of  technicians.    To  the  maximum extent  possible,  maintenance  is  to  be  accomplished  on  a  preplanned,  scheduled  basis.    This planning  provides  the  most  effective  and  efficient  use  of  people,  facilities  and  equipment, reduces  unscheduled  maintenance,  and  allows  for  progressive  actions  toward  maintaining  and returning  ICBMs  and  equipment  to  safe  operating  condition.    Maintenance  activities  ensure complete, quality maintenance and absolute compliance with technical data, safety and security standards. 1.9.  Weapon System. 1.9.1.  Remove  missiles  from  alert  status  to  perform  maintenance  actions  that  prevent progressive degradation of missile systems or to perform tests prescribed in TOs and higher headquarters’  directives  and  instructions.    When  practical,  a  scheduled  off  alert  will  be planned to align with other maintenance requiring the sortie to be scheduled off alert. 1.9.2.  Emphasize  configuration  management  of  facilities  and  equipment  at  all  levels  of management.    Maintain  ICBM  launch  facilities  to  the  same  standard  regardless  of  booster deployment status.  Mission requirements may require the re-deployment of a non-deployed launcher. 1.10.  Safety. 1.10.1.  Use unit plans/supplements  to  clearly establish specific roles and responsibilities of maintenance personnel during missile or nuclear mishaps (Missile Potential Hazard (MPH), Propulsion  System  Rocket  Engine  (PSRE)/Post  Boost  Control  System  (PBCS)  response, Nuclear  Weapon  Accident/Incident  response,  Missile  Booster  Movement  Plans,  etc.)  and disaster control situations. 1.10.1.1.  Coordinate  all  plans/supplements  through  unit  safety  to  applicable  MAJCOM logistics division.  (T-2). 1.10.1.2.  (576 Flight Test Squadron (FLTS)  Only)  Coordinate plans and supplements through 30 SW/ Safety (SE) to applicable MAJCOM logistics division. (T-2). 1.10.2.  The  Missile  Combat  Crew  (MCC)  is  in  command  of  the  launch  facility  (LF)  at  all times  regardless  of  its  status.    The  MCC  has  full  authority  to  prohibit  commencement  and direct  termination  of  any  task.    The  maintenance  Team  Chief  is  responsible  for  the  safe operation of the missile system in the LF once the LF is penetrated and lock pin assembly is installed  in  the  safety  control  switch.    The  team  chief  has  full  authority  to  prohibit commencement and direct termination of any task.   AFI21-202V1  18 JANUARY 2017 9 1.10.3.  (576 FLTS ONLY)  When the Launch Control Center (LCC) is manned, the MCC is in command of the inter-connected LF at all times regardless of its status.  The MCC has full authority to prohibit commencement and direct termination of any task.  Whether the LCC is manned  or  unmanned,  the  on-site  Team  Chief/Site  Supervisor  has  full  authority  to  prohibit commencement and direct termination of any task. 1.10.4.  Comply with the maximum duty periods and minimum rest periods for all personnel assigned to a maintenance activity IAW 21-200. 1.10.5.  When  a  critical  safety  deficiency  is  discovered,  the  reporting  activity  will  submit  a Deficiency Report (DR) IAW TO 00-35D-54 USAF Deficiency Reporting, Investigation, and Resolution.    The  reporting  activity  will  inspect  like  equipment  for  the  same  deficiency  as soon  as  possible  and  submit  a  follow  on  DR.    Refer  to  Support  Equipment  Stop-Use Procedures in chapter 2. 1.10.6.  (576  FLTS  ONLY)  Develop  convoy  procedures  for  missile  boosters  and  flight Aerospace  Vehicle  Equipment  (AVE)  IAW  MAJCOM  guidance.    Coordinate  convoy procedures through 30 SW/SE. 1.10.7.  Ensure  adherence  to  housekeeping,  safety,  security,  and  environmental  compliance in the workplace IAW AFI 91-203 Air Force Occupational and Environmental Safety, Fire Protection, and Health (AFOSH) Standards.  (T-2). 1.11.  Workload Requirements. 1.11.1.  Long-term hardware condition depends on regular periodic maintenance and a viable program to clear discrepancies. 1.11.2.  The  periodic  maintenance  program  must  ensure  the  performance  of  all  -6 requirements  as  well  as  the  full  spectrum  of  facilities  maintenance.  (T-2).    The  intent  is  to integrate all periodic maintenance efforts.  This window of opportunity should capitalize on clearing as many Workload Requirements File (WRF) discrepancies as possible.  If periodic maintenance  is  not  accomplished  during  other  site  penetrations  (“i.e.  3-year  periodic maintenance  cycle”),  annual  and  biennial  periodic  maintenance  requirements  will  be completed, to the maximum extent possible, during annual code change.  (T-3). 1.11.3.  All  weapon  system  maintenance,  support  equipment,  -6  workload  requirements, missile-related  Base  Civil  Engineering  (BCE)  discrepancies,  and  communication  system discrepancies  will  be  documented  in  IMDS.    This  will  include  all  work  orders  affecting LF/LCC/Communications  systems.    Refer  to  TO  00-20  series  publications  for  maintenance documentation procedures.  (T-2). 1.11.4.  Refer  to  AFI  21-103,  Equipment  Inventory  Status,  and  Utilization  Reporting,  for additional  communication  system  discrepancy  reporting  requirements.    MAJCOMs  will publish procedures for documentation of classified communications outages. 1.12.  Management. 1.12.1.  (N/A  576  FLTS)  The maintenance  goal  is  to  perform weapon system maintenance during  a  scheduled  12-hour  daylight  shift  following  the  rules  established  in  Table  2.2.  Ideally, teams are scheduled for 12 dispatches per month. 10 AFI21-202V1  18 JANUARY 2017 1.12.2.  (N/A  576  FLTS)  MCCs  may  perform  locally  specified  maintenance  tasks  in  the Launch  Control  Centers  (LCCs).    MXG/CC  and  OG/CC  must  approve  the  specified maintenance tasks in writing.  (T-3). 1.12.3.  (N/A  576  FLTS)  Security Forces may perform locally specified maintenance tasks at the Launch Facilities as directed by the Missile Maintenance Operations Center (MMOC).  MXG/CC and SFG/CC must approve specified maintenance tasks in writing. (T-3). 1.12.4.  (N/A  576  FLTS)  Security  Forces  may  perform  critical  emergency  maintenance tasks as directed by the MMOC.  Emergency maintenance tasks are defined as environmental control  system  resets  and  standby  power  system  resets  that  would  result  in  damage  to equipment  if  not  accomplished  in  minimum  time.    MMOC  will  request  Alarm  Response Team support through the MCC at the controlling Missile Alert Facility (MAF).  MXG/CC and SFG/CC must approve specified maintenance tasks in writing.  (T-3). 1.13.  Emergency  War  Order  (EWO)  Program  (N/A  576  FLTS).  At  all  operational  ICBM bases, the normal day-to-day maintenance activities that contribute to achieving, maintaining, or enhancing  alert  postures  are  EWO  activities.    Thus,  all  Non-Mission  Capable  (NMC)  and Partially-Mission Capable (PMC) maintenance at operational bases is EWO maintenance.  EWO Essential  Maintenance  is  repair  actions  required  to  generate  or  enhance  the  alert  posture  of missiles  and  enhance  the  launch  capability  of  LCCs.  For  Priority  1-4  maintenance  during advanced  DEFCONs,  the  MXG/CC  must  consider  the  tradeoffs  of  temporary  degrades  in hardness/capability caused by performing Priority 1-4 maintenance as opposed to not performing the maintenance.  (T-3).  In-shop EWO essential maintenance encompasses those repair actions required  to  support  the  generation  effort  during  advanced  DEFCONs.  Maintenance  personnel must know their responsibilities in the unit's EWO role. 1.14.  Technical  Data.  Use  of  the  prescribed  technical  data  to  maintain  the  ICBM  weapon system  and  support  equipment  is  mandatory  IAW  AFI  63-101_20-101,  Integrated  Lifecycle Management.  (T-1).  Use is defined as available and in-use, in the immediate work area. Official TO updates correcting technical deficiencies or implementing changes are increments of TO 00-5-1, AF Technical Order System distributed by Technical Order Management Agency (TOMA) and received by the organization’s Technical Order Distribution Office (TODO). 1.14.1.  All personnel will: 1.14.1.1.  Recommend improvements or corrections for TO deficiencies IAW TO 00-5-1. 1.14.1.2.  Continually assess TOs, supplements, and locally prepared technical data IAW TO 00-5-1 for currency, adequacy, availability, and condition. (T-2). 1.14.2.  Review  TO  Increments  and  TO  Recommendation  and  Reply  (AFTO  Form  22) change  requests  associated  with  ICBM  related  TOs  and  TOs  used  in  support  of  ICBM maintenance  and  operations  for  accuracy  IAW  TO  00-5-1  and  MAJCOM  and/or  Lead Command supplements. 1.14.3.  When performing nuclear weapon handling tasks, teams will verify and check steps off  as  they  are  performed  IAW  AFI  21-204,  Nuclear  Weapons  Maintenance  Management. (T-1).  MAJCOM(s) will identify ICBM RS mate/demate and handling tasks that are required to be checked off by the team. AFI21-202V1  18 JANUARY 2017 11 1.15.  Publications.  Air  Force  Missile  Systems  Maintenance  is  defined  by  this  instruction. MAJCOMs may supplement this AFI or publish a separate instruction IAW AFI 33-360.  Units must  tailor  procedures  to  the  unique  aspects  of  their  own  maintenance  operation  and  publish directives, instructions, supplements and, for functional areas, operating instructions according to AFI 33-360 areas where more detailed guidance or specific procedures will ensure a smooth and efficient operation. Adhere to the following procedures: 1.15.1.  Use  the  authorized  procedures  in  TO  00-5-1  for  Locally  Prepared  Workcards, Checklists, Job Guides, and Page Supplements. 1.15.2.

A5.1.3.4.  ROW Maintenance. A5.1.3.4.1.  Deficiencies.  The  HICS  ROW  is  USAF  Real  Property.  Correction  of deficiencies is a BCE responsibility. However, the CAO is the single point of contact for all ROW deficiencies and ensures corrective actions are implemented. The CAO will: A5.1.3.4.1.1.  Inspect all ROW problems (erosion, access/gate discrepancies, etc.) and  determine  corrective  actions  according  to  TO  21M-LGM30F-2-20-1  and/or applicable drawings.  (T-3). A5.1.3.4.1.2.  Coordinate  with  cable  maintenance  to  either  perform  repairs  or monitor BCE/contractor efforts as required.  (T-3). A5.1.3.4.1.3.  Request  BCE  assistance,  as  required.  If  BCE  cannot  support  the ROW repair with in-house resources, the CAO processes a BCE funded AF IMT 9,  Request  for  Purchase  for  contract  support.  Note:  At  bases  where  the  missile wing  is  a  tenant,  BCE  funding/reimbursement  for  missile  support  actions  is according to local support agreement. The CAO must submit annual requirements to  BCE  well  in  advance  for  funding  and  programming.  When  out-of-cycle funding is  necessary, the request  and justification must be submitted to BCE for joint resolution.  (T-3). A5.1.3.5.  ROW Projects. A5.1.3.5.1.  The  CAO  provides  annual  funding  requirements  for  ROW  projects, excluding  ROW  (HICS)  gate  projects,  requiring  contract  support  to  the  unit  budget officer.  These fund requirements are included in the yearly financial plans, Program 102 AFI21-202V1  18 JANUARY 2017 Element Code (PEC) 11323F, under Electronic Equipment and Inter/Intra Site Cable Maintenance Element of Expense Identification Code (EEIC) funds.  Based on these estimates,  AFGSC/A4C  allocates  funds  for  specific  projects  as  they  occur.    The expenses generated by reimbursable projects are paid from funds pre-deposited by the crossing agency in the Deposit Fund Account. A5.1.3.5.2.  The CAO coordinates un-programmed project requirements with unit and base budget offices to immediately notify AFGSC/A4C, AFGSC/FM and AF/IMFC.  (T-1). A5.1.3.5.3.  The CAO requests depot level support in accordance with TO 00-25-107 when repair/project requirements are beyond base level capabilities.  (T-2). A5.1.3.6.  HICS ROW Crossings. A5.1.3.6.1.  The  CAO  ensures  the  HICS  is  not  endangered  by  ROW  crossing  or construction activity. Crossings divide into three distinct categories: A5.1.3.6.1.1.  Crossings  where  the  government  has  lesser  easement  rights (secondary or later). A5.1.3.6.1.2.  Crossings where the government has superior easement rights (first or prior). A5.1.3.6.1.3.  Crossings  within  the  confines  of  a  public  ROW  where  the government was issued a license or permit for the cable installation. A5.1.3.6.2.  Future Crossings: When notified of a future crossing, the CAO and base Staff Judge Advocate (SJA) must initially determine who has the superior easement.  In  all  cases,  the  USAF  must  comply  with  the  terms  of  the  easement.    When  the question  of  superior  easement  determination  cannot  be  resolved,  the  CAO  forwards all  supporting  case  documents  to  applicable  MAJCOM  logistics  division  for resolution.    At  the  same  time,  the  CAO  must  obtain  sufficient  details  from  the crossing agency to determine what actions, if any, are necessary to protect the HICS.  (T-3).  Note: When the CAO knows of other crossing agency plans to cross the ROW but has not been properly contacted, the CAO must take the initiative to contact that party.    If  the  crossing  agency  refuses  to  submit  the  required  request,  the  CAO  must immediately advise appropriate MAJCOM logistics division and the base SJA of the potential legal problem. A5.1.3.6.3.  Crossings  without  Government  Superior  Easement  Rights  (Lesser).  Required  actions  depend  on  whether  Hardened  Intersite  Cable  (HIC)  lowering  or relocation is required due to the crossing activity. A5.1.3.6.3.1.  If no cable lowering or relocating is required, the CAO: A5.1.3.6.3.1.1.  Advises the crossing agency that: A5.1.3.6.3.1.1.1.  The  CAO  must  be  notified  72  hours  before  work  begins.  (T-2). A5.1.3.6.3.1.1.2.  Crossing work must be restricted to coordinated locations.  (T-2). AFI21-202V1  18 JANUARY 2017 103 A5.1.3.6.3.1.1.3.  Intentionally severing the HICS is  a criminal  offense and could result in legal actions according to United States Code.  (T-2). A5.1.3.6.3.1.1.4.  Repair costs for negligent severing or damage to the HICS will be billed to the crossing agency.  (T-2). A5.1.3.6.3.1.2.  Schedules  cable  teams  to  locate  and  stake  the  cable  in  the crossing  area  and  monitor  the  crossing  work.  Always  attempt  to  place  the cable  team  on-site  to  satisfy  the  time  and  date  requirements  of  the  crossing agency.  (T-2). A5.1.3.6.3.2.  Cable  lowering  or  relocating  must  be  accomplished  by  USAF resources (in-house or contracted agent) at government expense.  (T-1).  Under no circumstances  will  the  crossing  agency  lower  or  relocate  the  cable.    (T-1).    The CAO  coordinates  and  oversees  the  effort.    If  MMXS  lacks  resources  to  perform the work, the CAO seeks assistance in the following order: A5.1.3.6.3.2.1.  To the maximum extent possible, BCE resources will be used for  ROW  work.    (T-3).    The  CAO  must  coordinate  with  BCE  for  specific equipment, operator, and time requirements.  (T-3). A5.1.3.6.3.2.2.  Contract  support  with  EEIC  Funds.    The  CAO  arranges  for the  lease  or  rental  of  equipment  and  operators  as  required.    Note:  Contact cable maintenance for assistance as required. A5.1.3.6.4.  Crossings with Government Superior Easement Rights. Before the USAF permits any agency to cross the HICS, that agency must ask for consent-to-cross.  (T-1).  The agency must agree to the reimbursement procedures, when applicable, before the crossing can begin.  CAOs can grant conditional crossing consents if no problems are encountered and crossing restrictions are observed.  Note: Following conditional consent, refer to paragraph A5.1.3.6.4.3. for permanent consent procedures.  Consent-to-cross notification, reimbursement, issuance, and follow-on procedures are outlined below: A5.1.3.6.4.1.  Notification.  The CAO must advise the crossing agency, by letter, of the following: A5.1.3.6.4.1.1.  They cannot cross the ROW where the USAF has the superior easement except in a manner not involving physical or electronic interference with the HIC.  (T-2). A5.1.3.6.4.1.2.  They  must  provide  details  of  their  planned  activity  so  the CAO can determine whether HIC lowering or relocation is required.  (T-2). A5.1.3.6.4.1.3.  Any requirement to relocate the cable to preclude interference from  crossing  agency’s  crossings  will  be  done  by  the  USAF  at  the  crossing agency’s expense. Include reimbursement procedures in the letter.  (T-2). A5.1.3.6.4.2.  Reimbursement. Where the USAF has superior easement rights and must lower or relocate the HICS cable due to  the crossing agency’s activity, the crossing  agency  must  reimburse  the  USAF.    (T-1).    In  these  cases,  the reimbursement  procedures  in  AFI  65-601,  Volume  1,  Budget  Guidance  and Procedures, apply.  (T-1).  The CAO: 104 AFI21-202V1  18 JANUARY 2017 A5.1.3.6.4.2.1.  Provides  reimbursement  details  to  the  crossing  agency explaining they must pre-deposit sufficient funds to cover the cost, payable to the local Defense Accounting Office (DAO).  Also, advises the party that they must pay any claims filed as a result of activity associated with the crossing.  (T-1). A5.1.3.6.4.2.2.  Provides a cost  estimate to  the crossing agency, with  at  least the following cost breakouts: A5.1.3.6.4.2.2.1.  Military man-hours (by grade). A5.1.3.6.4.2.2.2.  Civilian man-hours (by grade). A5.1.3.6.4.2.2.3.  Material required (standard cost). A5.1.3.6.4.2.2.4.  Commercial equipment required (number of hours, type). A5.1.3.6.4.2.2.5.  Travel. A5.1.3.6.4.2.2.6.  Engineering.

Ensures  the  cost  estimate  letter  clearly  states  that  the crossing agency must provide additional pre-deposits if actual expenditures exceed the estimate.  Pre-deposit must be made before work commences. A5.1.3.6.4.3.  Issuance. When the crossing agency has requested consent-to-cross and has agreed to the reimbursement procedures, the CAO notifies the BCE real estate  office  by  letter.    The  letter  must  identify  the  specific  easements  involved and  request  the  BCE  real  estate  office  issue  a  consent-to-cross  to  the  crossing agency with at least the following provisions stated.  (T-1): A5.1.3.6.4.3.1.  Crossing criteria.  (T-1). A5.1.3.6.4.3.2.  Reimbursement  details,  as  provided  by  CAO applicable).  (T-1). (when A5.1.3.6.4.3.3.

A5.1.3.8.2.  Take  color  photographs  of  evidence  and  provide  them  to  the  base  SJA when possible.  The CAO advises/assists the SJA as required. 106 AFI21-202V1  18 JANUARY 2017 A5.1.3.9.  Project/Case Files. A5.1.3.9.1.  The  CAO  establishes  project/case  files  to  maintain  any  actions, documents,  and  photographs  pertaining  to  all  HICS  crossings,  projects,  or  ROW problems. A5.1.3.9.2.  Maintain  copies  of  all  reimbursement  billing  documents  for  future reference should auditing or legal actions occur.  (T-1).  Records will be maintained for  a  minimum  of  10  years.    (T-1).    Refer  to  AFMAN  33-363  and  the  Air  Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS). A5.1.3.10.  HICS Construction and Siting Criteria. A5.1.3.10.1.  HICS  construction  and  siting  requirements  are  found  in  TO  21M- LGM30F-2-20-1.  General  construction  and  siting  information  for  projects  affecting the  HICS  follows.    In  all  cases,  the  most  practical  and  economic  solution  will  be sought consistent with HICS hardness criteria. A5.1.3.10.2.  Construction Guidelines. A5.1.3.10.2.1.  For  all  construction  projects,  the  location  of  the  HICS  must  be positively identified before work commences.  (T-2). A5.1.3.10.2.2.  Decisions to reroute, relocate, or splice in additional HICS should be made only as a last resort.  (T-2). A5.1.3.10.2.3.  When  HICS  relocating  or  lowering  is  unavoidable  to  maintain separation criteria, 4 inches of select backfill must surround the HIC. Refer to TO 21M-LGM30F-2-20-1 for further protection requirements.  (T-2). A5.1.3.10.2.4.  Blasting activities are permissible provided that the HICS is not at risk  of  sustaining  physical  damage.  Consult  TO  21M-LGM30F-2-20-1  for specific criteria.  (T-2). A5.1.3.10.2.5.  For  underground  power  cables  with  a  potential  difference  of greater than 2400 volts to ground (e.g., Windfarm  collection grid lines) increase the minimum separation to at least 24 inches from the HICS with crossing angles at 90 degrees.  (T-2). A5.1.3.10.3.  Siting Criteria. A5.1.3.10.3.1.  New  utilities  should  be  installed  at  a  90-degree  crossing  angle when possible.  (T-2). A5.1.3.10.3.2.  Construction permits should not be issued for crossings within 50 feet of HICS splice locations.  (T-2). A5.1.3.10.3.3.  Communications  cables  must  have  a  minimum  separation  of  12 inches from the HICS. The minimum crossing angle is 30 degrees A5.1.3.10.3.4.  Pipelines must have a minimum separation of 12 inches from the HICS. Although the crossing angle is not critical, a minimum angle of 30 degrees is  desirable  to  lessen  the  possibility  of  damaging  the  HICS  during  the  crossing.  (T-2). AFI21-202V1  18 JANUARY 2017 107 A5.1.3.10.3.5.  Power cables must have a minimum separation of 18 inches from the HICS. The minimum crossing angle is 30 degrees. Underground power cables with  a  potential  difference  of  2400  volts  to  ground  must  have  a  metallic  sheath.  (T-2). A5.1.3.10.3.6.  Highway  and  railroad  crossing  criteria  are  stated  in  applicable drawings. When more practical to leave the HICS in place, waivers of this criteria must be granted by AFGSC/A4C.  (T-2). A5.1.3.10.3.7.  Installation of aerial transmission line towers or poles shall not be within100  feet  of  the  HICS,  if  possible.  The  separation,  required  to  avoid  HICS damage  during  tower/pole  installation,  may  be  waived  at  the  discretion  of  the CAO. The electrical effect of 60 hertz power transmission lines crossing parallel or nearly parallel to the HICS is negligible.  (T-2). A5.1.3.10.3.8.  Dam  and  pond  construction  over  the  HICS  will  be  avoided whenever  possible.  When  unavoidable,  the  CAO  must  ensure  no  HICS  splices remain in inundated areas.  (T-2).  108 AFI21-202V1  18 JANUARY 2017 Attachment 6 CENTRALIZED REPAIR ACTIVITY (CRA) A6.1.  Introduction.  This  attachment  contains  the  guidance,  responsibilities  and  procedures  to establish and manage a CRA.  It authorizes the centralized repair for direct maintenance of CE equipment;  it  also  authorizes  indirect  off-equipment  maintenance  for  designated  equipment components.  It applies to all Air Force organizations using a centralized repair concept to repair CE equipment. A6.2.  Basic Concept of Centralized Repair. A6.2.1.  Centralized  repair  consolidates  maintenance  and  supply  resources  at  designated locations  to  support  dispersed  equipment.  It  integrates  maintenance,  supply,  and  other logistics  elements  providing  a  cohesive  support  program that  enhances logistics responsiveness and operational effectiveness while reducing costs per AFI 23-101. A6.2.2.  CRAs consolidate tools, test equipment, spare and repair parts, and skilled personnel to provide a combination of logistic services for: A6.2.2.1.  Direct maintenance, on a dispatch basis, for unattended equipment.  (T-2). A6.2.2.2.  Direct,  usually  off-equipment,  maintenance  assistance  for  tasks  beyond  the capability of using organizations.  (T-2). A6.2.2.3.  Indirect  off-equipment  maintenance  and  direct  maintenance  of  designated reparable equipment.  (T-2). A6.2.2.4.  Control and distribution of reparable assets received for shop processing.  (T-2). A6.2.2.5.  Accomplishing using command maintenance at a central location.  (T-2). A6.2.2.5.1.  Establish  CRAs  for  one  system  or  type  of  equipment  and  to  perform command maintenance functions on the base or site of the CRA.  (T-2). A6.2.2.5.2.  CRAs  which  accomplish  direct  or  indirect  off-equipment  maintenance may  include  a  designated  supply  function,  a  dedicated  satellite  account  or  a  special support  function  within  the  supporting  LRS  complex.    This  function  controls  and processes reparable items and distributes serviceable items.  (T-2). A6.2.2.6.  Source  of  Repair  (SOR).  SORs  are  not  CRAs  as  defined  in  this  attachment; however,  when  jointly  agreed  to  by  a  MAJCOM  and  HQ  AFMC,  CRAs  may  perform SOR  maintenance  for  AFMC.    Such  workload  is  defined  in  a  project  directive  and implemented via project order.  (T-2). A6.3.  CE Centralized Repair Guidance. A6.3.1.  CRAs must provide clear economic advantages and an ability to sustain or increase maintenance  and  operational  effectiveness.    CRAs  will  not  duplicate  AFMC  technology repair center (depot) capabilities unless agreed to by HQ AFMC.  (T-2).   AFI21-202V1  18 JANUARY 2017 109 A6.3.2.  Specific CE centralized repair procedures are as follows: A6.3.2.1.  Note  that  the  centralized  repair  concept  may  be  authorized  when  economic benefits  are  realized  while  effectively  supporting  operational  readiness.    Base  decisions on  logistics  support  considerations  and  not  on  maintenance  factors  alone.    Assess tradeoffs between each type of maintenance support.  (T-2). A6.3.2.2.  Periodically  evaluate  maintenance  programs  and  plans  for  all  systems  and equipment  to  determine  if  changes  (either  consolidation  or  non-consolidation)  are appropriate.    For  existing  systems,  equipment,  and  components  supported  by  a  non- consolidated  maintenance  concept  at  least  one  of  the  following  benefits  must  be demonstrated or projected against the cost of converting to and sustaining consolidation.  (T-2). A6.3.2.2.1.  Improved  maintenance  effectiveness personnel and equipment by developing a greater technical capability. through  better  utilization  of A6.3.2.2.2.  Reduced manpower, equipment, and material. A6.3.2.2.3.  Reduced order, shipping times and transportation costs. A6.3.2.2.4.  Consider the impacts on: A6.3.2.2.4.1.  Inventory control point and depot source of repair. A6.3.2.2.4.2.  Automated management systems. A6.3.2.2.4.3.  Procedural changes, waivers, or alternatives. A6.3.2.2.4.4.  Financial and inventory accounting policies and procedures. A6.3.2.2.4.5.  Organizational structures and work center manning. A6.3.2.2.4.6.  One-time implementation costs. A6.3.2.2.4.7.  Engineering and technical services. A6.3.2.2.4.8.  Interservice support agreements, where applicable. A6.3.2.2.4.9.  Programmed equipment life. A6.3.2.2.4.10.  Investment spares cost at all levels. A6.3.2.2.4.11.  Contractor maintenance. A6.3.2.2.4.12.  Geographical dispersal and relocation of equipment. A6.3.2.2.4.13.  Acquisition  and  life  cycle  support  cost  for  common  and  peculiar equipment and tools. A6.3.2.2.4.14.  Obtaining required technical data. A6.3.2.3.  Implement  the  centralized  repair  concept  only  with  the  concurrence  of  all involved  MAJCOMs/agencies  (e.g.,  maintaining,  host,  AFMC  and  AIA)  unless  HQ USAF directs otherwise.  (T-2). A6.3.2.4.  Evaluate  the  centralized  repair  concept  during  the  programming  process  for facilities,  systems,  and  equipment  and  as  a  part  of  the  maintenance  planning  cycle  for new or improved systems.  (T-2). 110 AFI21-202V1  18 JANUARY 2017 A6.4.  Centralized Repair Concept Responsibilities. A6.4.1.  HQ  USAF/A4L  establishes  the  overall  guidance;  reviews  and  approves  plans, projects,  programs,  and  management  systems;  and  resolves  proposed  consolidation  actions that do not have the concurrence of all involved MAJCOMs.  (T-2). A6.4.2.  MAJCOMs establish a focal point for CRA management: A6.4.2.1.  Continually  monitor  the  support  posture  for  assigned  systems  and  equipment and  periodically  evaluate  pertinent  maintenance  programs  and  plans  to  determine  if changes are appropriate.  Publish Maintenance Action Directive (MAD) authorizing and directing establishment  of a CRA. MADs  also  identify  equipment  or systems supported by the CRA and any special funding arrangements, responsibilities, or procedures.  (T-2). A6.4.2.2.  Initiate  action  with  other  involved  commands  to  establish  CRAs  and  revise maintenance plans where appropriate.  (T-2). A6.4.2.3.  Coordinate changes to support posture with supported MAJCOMs.  (T-2). A6.4.3.  Note  that  supported  MAJCOMs  participate  with  maintaining  commands  to  assess consolidation  cost  effectiveness  and  to  develop  CRA  management  procedures  and  other support functions, as necessary.  (T-2). A6.4.4.  HQ AFMC: A6.4.4.1.  Ensures  maintenance  plans  and  programs  represent  an  integration  of  all support  levels  and  logistics  support  plans  identify  specific  procedures  applicable  to centralized repair. (T-2). A6.4.4.2.  Ensures  consolidation  efforts  are  compatible  with  the  functions  of  the inventory control point or national inventory control point. (T-2). A6.4.4.3.  Ensures  both  wholesale  and  retail  level  logistics  management  functions support the centralized repair concept and its specific application.  (T-2). A6.4.4.4.  Participates  with  and  supports  MAJCOMs  consolidation  cost  effectiveness assessments.  (T-2). A6.4.4.5.  Revises  maintenance  program  plans  and  documentation  to  reflect  centralized repair when applied.  (T-2). A6.4.4.6.  Monitors system and equipment support postures and recommends centralized repair to MAJCOMs when cost analysis indicates it is, or may be, appropriate.  (T-2). A6.4.4.7.  Ensures  maintenance  plans  and  programs  include  CRA  requirements  for  new equipment  and  are  outlined  in  the  appropriate  documents  such  as  Program  Active Directives (PAD), and Integrated Logistic Support Plan (ILSP).  (T-2). A6.4.5.  Assess  application  of  the  centralized  repair  concept  as  part  of  the  maintenance planning cycle for systems and equipment being developed.  (T-2). A6.4.6.  Air Intelligence Agency (AIA) participates with involved MAJCOMs in all aspect of consolidation that affects cryptologic equipment.  (T-2).   AFI21-202V1  18 JANUARY 2017 111 A6.5.  Authority to Establish Centralized Repair Activities (CRA). A6.5.1.  CRAs may be authorized in one of three ways: A6.5.1.1.  HQ USAF direction. A6.5.1.2.  Maintenance  Concepts.  Maintenance  concepts  are  normally  developed  during the  acquisition  programs  concept,  development,  and  validation  phases.    If  maintenance support responsibility within the command can best be accomplished by a CRA, include this concept in the ILSP.  Manpower, tools, test equipment, facilities, and other resources are programmed at this time. A6.5.1.3.  Maintenance  policy  reviews.  Reviews  of  maintenance  policies,  procedures, and concepts for certain existing equipment may justify a centralized repair concept.  A CRA  may  be  established  if  the  economic  analysis  is  favorable  and  HQ  AFMC  and affected MAJCOMs concur. A6.6.  CRA  Alignment.  CRAs  are  functionally  responsible  to  the  MAJCOM  headquarters  but organizationally assigned to a communications unit as outlined in appropriate MADs and UMDs.  Operate CRAs as work centers within the unit’s maintenance activity. A6.7.  Parent Unit Chief of Maintenance (COM) Responsibilities. A6.7.1.  Operate  the  CRA  according  to  applicable  MADs,  this  attachment,  and  command directives.  (T-2). A6.7.2.  Appoint production evaluators.  (T-2). A6.7.3.  Respond to Operations & Maintenance (O&M) assistance requests.  (T-2). A6.7.4.  Coordinate with base supply to ensure effective CRA supply procedures.  (T-2). A6.7.5.  Provide  MAJCOMs  with  updated  lists  of  supported  assets  to  ensure  AFMAN  23- 110, Volume 2, remains current.  The list includes the NSN, part number, and noun for each asset  supported  by  the  CRA.    Submit  recommended  additions  or  deletions  to  the  list  of supported assets.  (T-2). A6.7.6.  Budget for the day-to-day operation and support of the CRA.  (T-2). A6.8.  CRA Responsibilities. A6.8.1.  Perform  off-equipment  maintenance  that  is  beyond  the  capability  of  an  O&M activity.  Although a CRA does not normally duplicate depot capabilities, the CRA may be tasked to accomplish all maintenance for command supported equipment.  (T-2). A6.8.2.  CRAs may also be tasked to provide:  (T-3). A6.8.2.1.  On-site or telephonic assistance. A6.8.2.2.  Repair support to O&M activities under all MAJCOMs within a geographical area, or on a worldwide basis. A6.8.2.3.  Equipment modification beyond the capability of the O&M activity. A6.8.2.4.
