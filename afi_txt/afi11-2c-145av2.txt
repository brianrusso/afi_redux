General.  This  instruction  establishes  requirements  and  grading  criteria  for  ground  and flight phases of initial, requalification, and periodic flight evaluations.  Aircrew evaluations will be conducted In Accordance With (IAW) this instruction and Air Force Instruction (AFI) 11202, Vol  2,  Aircrew  Standardization/Evaluation  Program.    Specific  areas  for  evaluation  are prescribed  to  ensure  an  accurate  assessment  of  the  proficiency  and  capabilities  of  aircrews.  Flight  examiners  use  this  guidance  memorandum  when  conducting  aircrew  evaluations.  Instructors will use this AFI when preparing aircrews for qualification. 1.2.  Applicability.  This  instruction  applies  to  all  individuals  performing  duties  on  C-145A aircraft. 1.3.  Key words and definitions. 1.3.1.  “Must,” “Will,” and “Shall” indicate a mandatory requirement. 1.3.2.  “Should”  is  normally  used  to  indicate  a  preferred,  but  not  mandatory,  method  of accomplishment. 1.3.3.  “May” indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment. 1.3.4.  “Note”  indicates  operations  procedures,  techniques,  etc.,  considered  essential  to emphasize. 1.4.  Waivers.  Waiver authority for the contents of this document is AF/A3O. IAW AFI 11202, Vol 2, the MAJCOM/A3 is the waiver authority for individual aircrew requirements on a case-by-case  basis,  but  the  MAJCOM/A3  may  not  approve  blanket  or  group  (two  or  more  aircrew) waivers.    Waiver  requests  should  be  submitted  through  MAJCOM  Standardization  and Evaluation channels to the A3.  As applicable, MAJCOM/A3 will forward requests to AF/A3O, with  an  info  copy  to  AF/A3OI.    AFRC  crews  will  send  copies  of  all  waiver  requests  and approvals to AFRC/A3V. 1.4.1.  Tier requirements refer to waiver authority based on level of risk. 1.4.1.1.  “Tier 0” (T-0) requirements are reserved for requirements that non-compliance is determined and waived by respective non-Air Force authority. 1.4.1.2.  “Tier 1” (T-1) requirements are reserved for requirements non-compliance may put  airman,  mission,  or  program  strongly  at  risk,  and  may  only  be  waived  by  the MAJCOM/CC  or  delegate  with  concurrence  of  publication  approver.    When  multiple MAJCOMs are affected, then T-1 is appropriate. 1.4.1.3.  “Tier 2” (T-2) requirements are reserved for requirements that potentially put the mission at risk or potentially degrade the mission or program, and may only be waived by the MAJCOM/CC or delegate. 1.4.1.4.  “Tier  3”  (T-3)  requirements  are  reserved  for  requirements  that  non-compliance has a remote risk of mission failure, and  may be waived by the Wing/CC but no lower than the OG/CC. AFI11-2C-145AV2  23 APRIL 2015   5  1.5.  Supplements.  Units are encouraged to supplement this instruction with standard evaluation profiles  that  best  fit  the  unit’s  mission,  equipment,  and  location.    Units  will  forward  a  copy  of supplements HQ AFSOC/A3V, for approval. 1.6.  Evaluation  Procedures.  Before  the  aircrew  briefing,  the  evaluator  will  inform  the examinee of any special requirements.  Flight examiners will brief the examinee on the conduct, purpose, and requirements of the evaluation, as well as all applicable evaluation criteria, prior to flight  (Air  Force  Reserve  Command  only:    Any  unique  evaluator  inputs  to  the  planned  profile should  be  communicated  to  the  examinee  no  later  than  24  hours  prior  to  scheduled  mission brief).  The examinee will accomplish all required mission planning.  If an Operations Planning Team or Deployment Planning Team accomplishes mission planning, the examinee is ultimately responsible  for  the  accuracy  and  completeness  of  all  mission-planning  paperwork.    Flight examiners  will  be  furnished  a  copy  of  necessary  charts,  flight  logs,  mission  folders,  and  any additional items they deem necessary.  (T-3) 1.6.1.  Flight examiners will ensure all required training and documentation is complete prior to initial or requalification evaluations.  (T-3) 1.6.2.  Unless  requested  by  examinee  and  approved  by  squadron  supervision,  the  examinee will be current for all events evaluated during a periodic evaluation.  (T-3) 1.6.3.  Flight  examiners  will  not  intentionally  fail  any  equipment  during  flight  evaluations, but may deny the use of systems not effecting safety of flight.  Systems that can be denied in-flight are as follows:  Navigational aids or displays, Autopilot, Flight Director, flaps for no-flap  landings,  primary  trim  controls.    Examiners  may  use  reduced  power  settings  for simulated engine-out maneuvers.  (T-3) 1.6.3.1.  Under no circumstances will a pilot or loadmaster (if applicable) flight examiner allow  a  multiengine  aircraft  to  slow  below  one  engine  inoperative  minimum  control speed (Vmca), regardless of airspeed tolerances listed for specific areas. 1.6.4.  Flight  examiners  will thoroughly debrief  or critique all aspects  of the flight.   During the  critique,  the  flight  examiner  will  review  the  examinee’s  overall  rating,  specific deviations, area/subarea grades assigned, and any additional training required.  (T-3) 1.7.  Grading Instructions.  All evaluations will follow the guidelines set in AFI 11-202, Vol 2, and this AFI.  Examiners will use the criteria contained in this instruction to accomplish all flight and  emergency  procedures  evaluations.    To  ensure  standard  and  objective  evaluations,  flight examiners will be thoroughly familiar with the prescribed evaluation criteria.  (T-3) 1.7.1.  Area/Subarea  Grades.    Areas/subareas  will  have  a  two-level  (Q/U)  or  three-level (Q/Q-/U) grading system.  Discrepancies will be documented against the listed subareas. 1.7.1.1.  Q is the desired level of performance.  The examinee demonstrated a satisfactory knowledge  of  all  required  information,  performed  aircrew  duties  within  the  prescribed tolerances, and accomplished the assigned mission. 1.7.1.2.  Q-  indicates  the  examinee  is  qualified  to  perform  the  assigned  area/subarea tasks, but requires debriefing or additional training as determined by the flight examiner.  Deviations  from  established  standards  must  not  exceed  the  prescribed  Q-  tolerances  or jeopardize flight safety.   6  AFI11-2C-145AV2  23 APRIL 2015 1.7.1.3.  U  indicates  a  breach  of  flight  discipline,  performance  outside  allowable parameters or deviations from prescribed procedures or tolerances that adversely effected mission  accomplishment  or  compromised  flight  safety.    An  examinee  receiving  an area/subarea grade of U normally requires additional training.  When, in the judgment of the  flight  examiner,  additional  training  will  not  constructively  improve  examinee’s performance, it is not required.  In this case, the flight examiner must thoroughly debrief the examinee. 1.7.2.  Critical  Areas.    Critical  areas  require  adequate  accomplishment  by  the  aircrew member  in  order  to  successfully  achieve  the  mission  objectives.    If  an  aircrew  member receives  an  unqualified  grade  in  any  critical  area,  the  overall  grade  for  the  evaluation  will also be unqualified.  Critical areas are identified by “(Critical)” in the area title. 1.8.  Evaluation  Requirements.  Evaluation  profiles  will  reflect  a  sampling  of  the  unit’s missions.  Evaluation tables are provided to summarize evaluation areas.  Areas common to all crew  members  are  contained  in  Table  2.1.    Instructor  evaluation  areas  are  in  Table  3.1.  Evaluation areas unique to each crew position are located in their respective chapter.  Each crew specific  chapter  defines  required  events.    Evaluation  methods  are  identified  by  NOTES  in  the crew  specific  tables  and  include:    In-flight  only;  in-flight  and/or  in  simulator  (see  Paragraph 1.8.1); and in-flight and/or alternate methods (see Paragraph 1.8.2).  For areas without a NOTE, flight examiners may evaluate at their discretion if observed.  If required events are not observed, then the evaluation is incomplete and will be accomplished on another flight.  (T-3) 1.8.1.  Simulator.    Weapon  System  Trainers  may  be  used  to  accomplish  evaluations  if certified  by  HQ  AFSOC/A3.    Do  not  conduct  two  consecutive  evaluations  in  the  simulator (Exception:  Instrument evaluations.)  (T-2) 1.8.1.1.  If  an  area/subarea  was  not  able  to  be  evaluated  in-flight,  and  the  event  is certified for evaluation purposes in the simulator, it may be evaluated in the simulator to complete the evaluation.  Document in the comments section of AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew  Qualification,  which  portion(s)  of  the  evaluation  were  conducted  in  the simulator.  (T-3) 1.8.2.  Alternate  Method.    When  it  is  impossible  to  evaluate  an  area  in-flight  due  to equipment  malfunctions,  operational  requirements,  scheduling  restrictions,  or  weather,  the area may be evaluated by an alternate method (i.e., procedural trainer or verbal examination).  If, in the flight examiner’s judgment, an item cannot be adequately evaluated by an alternate method, complete the evaluation on an additional flight.  (T-3) 1.8.3.  Grading  Criteria.    To  the  maximum  extent  possible,  flight  examiners  will  use  the grading criteria in this volume to determine individual area grades.  Exercise judgment when the wording of areas is subjective and when specific areas are not covered.  Flight examiner judgment will be the determining factor in arriving at the overall grade.  Consider cumulative deviations when determining the overall grade. 1.8.3.1.  Base tolerances for in-flight parameters on conditions of smooth air and a stable aircraft.    In  some  cases,  momentary  deviations  are  allowable  provided  the  examinee applies prompt corrective action and such deviations do not jeopardize safety. 1.9.  Unsatisfactory  Performance.  If  the  flight  examiner  observes  an  aircrew  counterpart jeopardizing  safety,  the  examiner  will  assume  the  duties  of  that  aircrew  member  (provided  the AFI11-2C-145AV2  23 APRIL 2015   7  examiner’s Flight Duty Period (FDP) does not exceed AFI 11-202 Vol 3, General Flight Rules, maximum  FDP  for  an  unaugmented  crew.    This  does  not  mean  the  examiner  must  assume  the examinee’s position any time unsatisfactory performance is observed.  If the examiner feels the examinee  can  continue  safely  with  supervision,  the  examiner  is  not  required  to  assume  the examinee’s  duties.    However,  if  the  flight  examiner  assumes  the  examinee’s  duties,  assign  a Qualification Level 3 (Q-3) as the overall grade. 1.9.1.  Evaluators  must  report  deviations  or  discrepancies  from  established  procedures  or directives in any area, regardless of the individual’s crew specialty, to the squadron or group commander, along with evaluator’s recommendation for corrective action, IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 2, AFSOC Sup 1, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program.  (T-3) 1.10.  Additional Training.  Flight examiners are responsible for assigning additional training at their  discretion.    Document  additional  training  and  completion  IAW  AFI  11-202,  Vol  2.    Any approved training device or medium may be used for additional training.  (T-3) 1.10.1.  Additional  training  may  be  accomplished  on  the  same  flight  as  the  evaluation, provided  the  unique  situation  presents  a  valuable  training  opportunity  (i.e.,  crosswind landings), and the discrepancy requiring the additional training will not result in overall Q-3 evaluation.    This  option  requires  flight  examiner  discretion  and  judicious  application.    The examinee must be informed when the additional training begins and ends.  (T-3) 1.11.  Rechecks.  Rechecks  will  normally  be  administered  by  a  flight  examiner  other  than  the one who administered the original evaluation.  (T-3) 1.12.  Special  Qualifications.  Special  qualification  evaluations  are  administered  for  Special Mission events that are not universal to all members in that crew position.  Special qualification evaluations  may  be  conducted  separately  or  in  conjunction  with  the  qualification  or  mission evaluations.    After  qualification,  areas  may  be  graded  as  part  of  periodic  mission  evaluations.  There  are  no  requisites  for  special  qualification  evaluations  unless  specified.    Refer  to  the appropriate crew position for any special qualification evaluation requirements. 1.12.1.  Special qualifications result in an AF Form 8.  Document IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 2, as a  SPOT  evaluation  in  the  flight  phase  block  of  the  AF  Form  8/8a.    If  the  evaluator  is current/qualified in a special mission event (SME), and the SME is accomplished during the evaluation  profile,  the  SME  will  be  evaluated  during  the  mission  (MSN)  evaluation  but annotated separately on the AF Form 8/8a in the Mission Description.  Although a unit may maintain 100 percent of its crew members qualified, this documentation is still required due to intrafly and permanent change of station issues. 1.13.  Flight  Evaluation  Worksheets.  AFSOC  Form  48,  Flight  Evaluation  Worksheet, generated  flight  evaluation  worksheet  or  electronic  equivalent  (Patriot  Excalibur)  are  permitted to  assist  with  the  evaluation.    If  a  flight  evaluation  worksheet  is  used,  it  must  be  current  in relation to requirements outlined in this instruction and evaluation tables. 1.14.  Multiple Qualification.  Each aircraft requires a separate Qualification (QUAL), Mission (MSN), and Instructor evaluation.  The Instrument (INSTM) evaluation will be maintained in the most  complex  aircraft  flown  by  the  examinee  (i.e.,  aircraft  with  retractable  gear,  multiengine aircraft,  etc.).    Squadron  Standardization/Evaluation  will  determine  complex  aircraft  priority.  (T2)   8  AFI11-2C-145AV2  23 APRIL 2015 Chapter 2 ALL EVALUATIONS 2.1.  General.  The general grading criteria contained in this chapter applies to all crew positions and all evaluations.  The examinee must satisfactorily demonstrate the ability to perform required duties  safely  and  effectively.    This  includes  appropriate  aircraft  systems  operation  IAW applicable technical orders, instructions, and directives.  (T-2) 2.2.  Requirements.  Evaluate all crew members on areas listed in Table 2.1. 2.2.1.  Examinations.  All crew members will complete open and closed book examinations as  a  requisite  to  periodic  evaluations  IAW  AFI  11-202,  Vol  2.    Pilots  will  complete  the instrument examination as a requisite to periodic INSTM evaluations IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 2,  and  AFMAN  11210,  Instrument  Refresher  Program  (IRP).    QUAL  and  MSN examinations may be combined and given as one examination.  Reference AFI 11-202, Vol 2 for required number of questions and test question structure.  (T-2) 2.2.2.  Emergency  Procedures  Evaluation  (EPE).    An  EPE  is  a  requisite  for  all  QUAL  and MSN  evaluations  except  for  special  qualification  evaluations.    EPEs  may  be  conducted verbally, in-flight, in a simulator, or by another method determined by the examiner or unit stan/eval.    Operations  Group  Standardization  and  Evaluation  may  develop  EPE  guides  for each crew position for flight examiner use.  EPEs should be scenario driven, and tailored to the specific  crew position.  The EPE  will include areas commensurate  with the examinee’s qualification and experience level.  Examiners should include other general knowledge areas as well.  For mission evaluations, evaluate mission-specific equipment and situations.  EPEs will  include  sufficient  in-  flight  and  ground  emergencies  to  evaluate  the  examinee’s knowledge of systems and procedures to the flight examiner’s satisfaction.  (T-2) 2.2.2.1.  Examinees  may  use  publications  that  are  normally  available  in-flight.    The examinee should recite all Critical Actions Procedures from memory and should provide the initial steps of the emergency procedures that, in the opinion of the examiner, would not allow time for reference. 2.2.2.2.  Grading criteria for EPE are outlined in area 5 of General Grading Areas. 2.2.3.  Publications Check.  Required for all INSTM, QUAL, MSN, or combined evaluations (e.g., INSTM/QUAL/MSN) as outlined in area 12 of General Grading Areas.  (T-3) 2.2.4.  Cockpit/Crew  Resource  Management  (CRM).    In  accordance  with  AFI  11-290, Cockpit/Crew  Resource  Management  Training  Program,  crew  resource  management  skills will  be  evaluated  during  initial  and  periodic  evaluations.    CRM  skills  are  integral  to  all phases  of  flight;  therefore  no  specific  area  titled  CRM  exists.    CRM  skills  are  imbedded within  specific  grading  criteria  (mission  planning,  airmanship/situational  awareness,  crew coordination,  communication,  risk  management/decision  making,  task  management,  and briefing/debriefing)  and  include  all  of  the  skills  listed  on  the  AF  Form  4031,  CRM  Skills Criteria Training/ Evaluation Form.  Therefore, use of the AF Form 4031 is unnecessary for evaluations. AFI11-2C-145AV2  23 APRIL 2015   9  2.2.5.  Formal  Course  Evaluations.    All  required  areas  must  be  evaluated  for  the  type  of evaluation  flown  IAW  this  AFI.    Grade  training  objectives  and  related  areas  using  the performance criteria in this AFI.
