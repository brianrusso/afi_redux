RANDON TECH ROPE LADDER  (H-1 ELPD800PD-1) If any nicks or excessive fraying to the point of broken strands are found, do not use the rope ladder for live operations, as serious injury or death may result. See figures 5-7 and 5-8 in T.O. 00-25-245.  The following indicate obsolete equipment and should not be used for live operations, serious injury or death may result: • Corrosion on the rivet-washer connection points (should be stainless-stainless).  • Rope ladder fabric with shiny appearance (similar to a vehicle seat belt).  • Detacher housings without beveled or rounded edges When preparing the rope ladder for night operations, do not use duct tape on the nylon fabric.  Duct tape residue hinders the post flight fabric cleansing, and hides potential problem areas. (e.g. use rubber bands, plastic zip ties).   During inspection, dragging the rope ladder on concrete should be kept to a minimum to reduce abrasion and maintain normal service life. 1. Ensure detacher serial numbers match rope ladder.  2. Inspect detacher device fasteners for loosening and failure.  3. Inspect detacher pip pin for proper spring/operation.  4. Inspect carabineers for corrosion and proper operation.  5. Inspect wheeled rungs/fasteners for loosening and failure.  6. Inspect main ladder straps for dry-rot, holes, nicks and excessive fraying.  • Ensure both sides of the rope ladder are visually inspected.  • Detachers are "powder-coated", there is no need to oil parts.  • Small amounts of hydraulic fluid are allowed on the fabric.  • Ensure the ladder is cleaned after use. 7. Inspect ladder rungs for damaged tubes or grip tape.  8. Inspect rung rivet-washer points for corrosion, cracks or stretched fabric.  9. Ensure no twists exist with main ladder straps.   AFI11-2UH-1NV3CL-1 16 March 2015 10. Fold or roll the ladder into the stowed position on the cabin floor. 25 Refer to T.O. 00-25-245 for post flight requirements. 31.  FAST ROPE  1. Check the woven loop on the mount end for excessive wear or chemical contamination.  2. Check the rope along its entire length for fraying, cuts and chemical contamination.  Inspect for any cut, chafe, or nicks that affect the integrity of the rope.  3. Do not use a rope that is severely frayed (light fraying on the rope from normal use does not weaken the rope).  4. Do not use a rope when any single strand is cut halfway through.  5. Inspect the rope for contamination of acid, alkaline compounds, saltwater, fire extinguisher solutions or petroleum-based solvents. Changes in color caused by chemicals are usually blotchy and have an unusual odor.  Although used ropes gradually change color, such changes do not indicate a decrease in strength unless the change is due to contact with strong chemicals. Changes occurring because of use are usually uniform throughout the length of the rope.  6. Make necessary inspection entries on the appropriate form.  Refer to T.O. 00-25-245 for post flight requirements.    AFI11-2UH-1NV3CL-1 16 March 2015 26 Attachment 1  GLOSSARY OF REFERENCES AND SUPPORTING INFORMATION  References AFPD 11-2, Aircraft Rules and Procedures, 14 Jan 2005 AFI 11-2UH-1N Volume 3, UH-1N Helicopter Operations Procedures,  19 Apr 2012 AFI 11-2UH-1N Volume 3 CL-1, UH-1N Helicopter Crew Briefing Guides and Checklists, 27 Feb 2007 AFI 11-2UH-1N Volume 3 CL-2, UH-1N Helicopter Mission Equipment Cleaning and Inspection Procedures, 28 Feb 2007 AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management, 25 Sep 2013 AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, 1 Mar 2008 T.O. 00-25-245, Testing and Inspection for Personnel Safety and Rescue Equipment, 1 Sep 2006, change 4, 10 Aug 2013 Forms Adopted AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, 22 Sep 2009 AFTO Form 781A, 11 Sep 2008  Abbreviations and Acronyms AC—Aircraft Commander ACDE—Aircrew Chemical Defense Equipment AFDW—Air Force District of Washington AFFSA—Air Force Flight Standards Agency AIE—Alternate Insertion/Extraction AOB—Air Order of Battle BDHI—Bearing-Distance-Heading Indicator CBRN— Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear CDI—Course Deviation Indicator CG—Center of Gravity  27 AFI11-2UH-1NV3CL-1 16 March 2015 CHUM—Chart Update Manual CI—Course Indicator CSEL—Combat Survivor Evader Locator DA—Decision Altitude DME—Distance Measuring Equipment EP—Emergency Procedure EPUBS—Electronic Publications  ESA—Emergency Safe Altitude FCIF—Flight Crew Information File GOB—Ground Order of Battle GSI—Glide Slope Indicator IAF—Initial Approach Fix ICS—Intercommunications System IFR—Instrument Flight Rules ILS—Instrument Landing System IMC—Instrument Meteorological Conditions  IP—Initial Point  LPU—Life Preserver Unit LZ—Landing Zone MB—Marker Beacon MDA—Minimum Decent Altitude NOTAMS—Notice to Airmen NVG—Night Vision Goggles ROE—Rules of Engagement SAR—Search and Rescue SEA—Survival Egress Air SRUF—Standing Rules on the Use of Force TACAN—Tactical Air Navigation System TCN—Terminal Change Notice TOLD—Takeoff and Landing Data TOT—Time On Target VHF—Very High Frequency VOR—VHF Omni-Directional Radio Range VVI—Vertical Velocity Indicator
