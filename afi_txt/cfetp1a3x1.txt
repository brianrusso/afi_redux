This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive education and training document that identifies life-cycle education/training requirements, training support resources and minimum core task requirements for this specialty.  The CFETP will provide personnel a clear career path to success and instill rigor in all aspects of career field training. 2.  The CFETP consists of two parts; both of which are used by management to plan, manage, and control training within the career field. 2.1. Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty.  Section A explains how everyone will use the plan; Section B identifies career progression information, duties and responsibilities, training strategies, and career field path; Section C associates each level with specialty qualifications (knowledge, education, training, and other); Section D indicates resource constraints.  Some examples are funds, manpower, equipment, and facilities.  Note:  The Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory (AFECD) and AFI 36-2101 Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted) contain the specialty descriptions. 2.2.  Part II includes the following: Section A identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS) and includes duties, tasks, technical references to support training, Air Education and Training Command (AETC) conducted training, and correspondence course requirements.  Section B contains the course objective list and training standards supervisors will use to determine if Airmen satisfy training requirements.  Section C identifies available training support materials.  Section D identifies a training course index that is used to determine resources available to support training. Included here are both mandatory and optional courses.  Sections E and F identify MAJCOM unique training requirements. 2.3.  Attachment 3 to the electronic version of the CFETP is a career path chart.  This chart provides a visual depiction of the Airborne Missions Systems Operator AFSC, Career Enlisted Flyers Incentive Pay gates and years of aviation service, and key information to education, training and qualification.

This CFETP provides information necessary for the Air Force Career Field Manager (AFCFM), MAJCOM functional managers (MFMs), commanders, training managers, supervisors, and trainers to plan, develop, manage, and conduct an effective and efficient career field training program.  The plan outlines the training that individuals must receive in order to develop and progress throughout their career.  For the purpose of this plan, training is divided into four areas: initial skills, upgrade training (UGT), qualification training (QT), and continuation training (CT). Initial skills training is the Air Force Specialty specific training an individual receives upon entry into the Air Force or upon retraining into this specialty for award of the 3-skill level. Upgrade training identifies the mandatory courses, task qualification requirements, and correspondence course completion required for award of the 5-, 7-, and 9-skill levels. Qualification training is actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an airman in a specific duty position. This training program occurs both during and after the upgrade training process. It is designed to provide the performance skills/knowledge training required for the job. Continuation training is additional training either in-residence or exportable advanced training courses, or on-the-job training, provided to personnel to maintain their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required. The CFETP has several purposes, some are: 1.1.  Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field training program.   1.2.  Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in this specialty and recommends training and education throughout each phase of an individual's career. 1.3.  Lists training courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of training, and the training medium. 1.4.  Identifies major resource constraints that impact full implementation of the desired specialty training program. 2.  Uses.   The plan will be used by MFMs and supervisors at all levels to ensure comprehensive and cohesive training programs are available and/or instituted for each individual in the specialty. 2.1.  Training personnel will develop and revise formal resident, non-resident, and exportable training based on requirements established by the user and documented in Part II of the CFETP.  The lead command MFM will work with the AFCFM to develop acquisition strategies for obtaining resources needed to provide the identified training. 2.2.  MFMs will ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial and upgrade skills requirements. Identified requirements can be satisfied by OJT, resident training, contract training, or exportable courses. MAJCOM-developed training to support this AFSC must be identified for inclusion in this plan and must not duplicate available training resources. 2.3.  Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan.  The list of courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training. 2.4.  Personnel in AFSCs 1AXXX or 1U0X1 are exempt from maintaining OJT Training Folders (AF Form 623). That training is certified via AF Form 8 Certificate of Aircrew Qualification by trained flight examiners.  Certification of the AF Form 8 eliminates the requirement to document STS items in this CFETP. 3.  Coordination and Approval.  The AFCFM is the approval authority.  MAJCOM functional managers and AETC training managers will identify and coordinate on the career field training requirements.  The AFCFM will initiate an annual review of this document and coordinate with AETC and MFMs to ensure currency and accuracy. Using the list of courses in Part II, they will eliminate duplicate training. Send applicable inputs/changes to this CFETP through MAJCOM functional managers to HQ USAF/A3OIM, 1480 Air Force Pentagon, Washington D.C. 20330-1480 or the following organizational email address  usaf.pentagon.af-a3.mbx.a3oim-workflow@mail.mil   Section B - Career Progression and Information 4.

The CFETP uses a building block approach (simple to complex) to encompass the entire spectrum of training requirements for the Airborne Mission Systems Operator specialty. This CFETP was developed to include life-cycle (day one through retirement) training requirements for this specialty. The spectrum includes a strategy for when, where, and how to meet the training requirements. The strategy must be apparent and affordable to reduce duplication of training and eliminate a disjointed approach to training.  6.1. Initial Skills Training.  Initial physiological training will be conducted at the Aircrew Fundamentals Course.  Significant changes were made in initial skills training.  A Course Training Standard (CTS) was created  to align common core training amongst all 1A/1U AFSCs into the Aircrew Fundamentals Course.  The initial skills training will be revised to provide training needed to prepare graduates for Airborne Mission Systems Operator related positions. 6.2. Five Level Upgrade Training.  Completion of initial qualification training and a successful form 8 on members first assigned weapons system.   6.3. Seven Level Upgrade Training. Must complete all 3- and 5-skill level training requirements.  No formal 7-level upgrade training exists.
