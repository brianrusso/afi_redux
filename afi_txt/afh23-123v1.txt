Serviceable turn-in from detail records such as WRM will contain supply action taken code T. b.  Action taken code U will decrease the cumulative recurring demands by the quantity turned in. c.  When the item turned in is a Deficiency Report exhibit, use supply condition code Q and action taken code C.  For Deficiency Report credit policy, see the materiel deficiency procedures. Notes: 1.  Action taken code D is used to indicate an item was 1) bench checked at a forward operating base, dispersed operating base, or en route base, 2) found to be unserviceable, and 3) transferred to a main operating base or home base for repair. If a turn-in input contains a supplementary address in positions 45-50, action taken code D will cause the item to be shipped to that AFH23-123  8 AUGUST 2013 13 address. Do not use code D for turn-in of items with Expendability/Recoverability/Repairability/Cost Designator (ERRCD) XB, and do not use it when shipping unserviceable items to Inventory Managers, special repair activities, or other official depot level repair functions. 2.  Under the conditions listed below, items turned in with other action taken codes will be shipped to other Air Force bases and the code will be automatically changed to D. a.  Override record address. When the override record correlates with the shipment exception code, the item is shipped to the override record address. b.  Reparable destination address. When the reparable destination/ disposition code contains an address, the item is shipped to that address. c.  Missing address reject. When the turn-in does not direct a shipment to another Air Force base, an invalid action taken code reject will be generated. 3.  Action Taken Code 8 forces the automatic shipment of items to AFMC depots. Do not use it with ERRCD XB items; do not use it for shipment to repair facilities other than AFMC; and do not use it when the Inventory Manager directs the return of an awaiting parts (AWP) asset for lack of parts. 2.3.2.9.

Code Category 1. When A2* transactions are manually input with any of these denial codes in position 72, the retail supply system outputs a B7* denial transaction.   Category 2. These codes cannot be manually assigned. Rather, they are programmatically assigned by the retail supply system as appropriate during A2* processing. D E F G On-hand assets are deployed. Reason For Denial On-hand assets are in a built-up configuration and cannot be broken down locally. On-hand assets are in an off-base supply point. Only assets available are on items with an incompatible ISG source code. W  Warehouse refusal. On-hand group balance is zero. X Denied as a result of request for cancellation from the ICP. 1 On-hand balance for condition code requested is zero. 3 On-hand balance is equal to or less than the authorized requisitioning objective. Applies to priority 01-15 non-MICAP RDOs. Item record is not loaded for serviceable transactions, or unserviceable detail is not on file for unserviceable transactions. 5  WRM due-out quantities on file are less than the input quantity 4 6 A of the RDO. Date of last demand is not zero or the DOLD is less than 910 days from the ordinal date. Firm DIFM assets (excluding on-hand balance) for condition code requested are zero. AFH23-123  8 AUGUST 2013 37 C I J L N S T Firm DIFM assets (excluding Deficiency Report exhibits) on-hand balance is equal to or less than the authorized requisitioning objective. Applies to priority 01-15 non-MICAP RDOs. Condition or identity change does not allow shipment. Partial denial. On-hand balance for condition code requested is zero. Partial denial. On-hand balance is equal to or less than the authorized requisitioning objective. Applies to priority 01-15 non-MICAP RDOs. No accessible assets available to satisfy RDO. Code N is assigned when an RDO is automatically passed through ES-S (from DLATS) and the ES-S asset availability (automatic sourcing) logic determines that no assets are available for automatic release. Assets may be on-hand but manual intervention is required. See Chapter 12 of the ES-S user’s manual for more information on the asset availability logic used by ES-S.  Level on master. On-hand balance is less than or equal to the authorized safety level. Applies to non-MICAP priority 01-08 RDOs. Level on master. On-hand balance is less than or equal to the authorized requisitioning objective. Applies to priority 09-15 RDOs. 2.3.2.105.

An identification number associated with a specific item. It is made up of the FSC – 4 digits and the NIIN – 9 digits. A two digit Material Management Code (MMAC – 2 digits) may be assigned to  the NSN, but  it is  not  part of the  NSN.  Note:  The first  two digits of the FSC are the FSG and identify the commodity of an item. Likewise, the first two digits of (NSN) 62 AFH23-123  8 AUGUST 2013 the  NIIN  are  the  NCB  Code  and  identify  the  country  that  assigns  the  number.  See  also STOCK NUMBER. 2.3.2.206.  NEW-OTHER-ASSET-FLAG  (6-position  A/N).  Identifies  on  the  item record  any  of  six  types  of  items  by  means  of  the  following  individual  flags:    1)  bench stock, 2) MSK-item,  3) overflow adjunct, 4) supply point, 5) supplemental  adjunct, and 6) mission-change-ISSL items. These six flags are explained separately in this chapter. 2.3.2.207.  NOMENCLATURE  (19-position  A/N).  Describes on the item record those items  which  are  identified  by  a  unique  NSN.  Nomenclature  identifies  items  in  graphic and specific terms (for example, LUMBER 2X4X4X GR2, or SUIT FLY SIZE 46S).   A 2.3.2.208.  NONCONSUMABLE  ITEM  MATERIEL  SUPPORT  CODE  . nonconsumable item has been defined as an item of supply which is managed by one or more  Military  Services  as  a  nonconsumable  (i.e.,  major  end  item,  depot  reparable  or nonstock-funded consumable). See DoD 4100.39-M, Vol 10 for a list of these codes. 2.3.2.209.  NON-STOCKED  ITEM  DUE-OUT  CAUSE  CODES  (NIMSC).  Non-stocked item backorder cause codes are assigned due to insufficient item demand history for computation of a demand-based stock level. Normally, non-stocked item cause codes consist of three general groups of items including: items with no previous demand (first-time)  or  not  enough  demand  history;  items  the  retail  supply  system  has  decided  not  to stock;  and  items  management  has  decided  not  to  stock.  See    Backorder  (Due-Out) Cause  Code  for  more  information  and  explanation  of  each  type  of  non-stocked  item backorder cause code. 2.3.2.210.  NOT  REPARABLE  THIS  STATION  INDICATOR  (NRTS)  (1-position N)  . NRTS code 1 identifies repair cycle items for which there is no base level repair or diagnostics  capability.    For  NSNs  identified  as  NRTS-1,  the  phrase  NRTS-1  BENCH CHECK  is  printed  on  the  ISU,  DOR,  and  I004  management  notice.  The  NRTS-1 indicator  is  placed  in  the  Repair  Cycle  Asset  Management  Listing  (D23/NGV905)  to allow  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  to  expedite  bench  check  material  return  and shipment. Reference Table 2.3 Action Taken Codes for NRTS items. 2.3.2.211.  NUCLEAR WEAPONS RELATED MATERIEL (NWRM) INDICATOR (1-position  A*).

The value is entered as whole dollars. 2.3.2.216.  ON  ORDER  DUE  IN  FROM  MAINTENANCE  AMOUNT  (10-position N).  On  the  Consolidated  Status  and  Transaction  Statement  (TABLE  III/M20)  the  on order  DIFM  column  reflects  summary  dollar  value  of  all  DIFM  detail  quantities excluding those to contract maintenance. The DIFM is applied in priority sequence to all residual deficits remaining after application of serviceable and unserviceable, and is also added  to  the  applicable  unserviceable  field;  therefore,  this  column  is  a memo  data  field and  not  used  in  the  computation  for  the  deficit  column.  The  value  is  entered  as  whole dollars. 2.3.2.217.  ON-TIME  RECEIPTS  BASE  STANDARD  (3-position  binary).  Indicates the  accumulated  total  of  all  receipts  received  within  the  standard  time  frame  for  base order  and  shipping.

STANDARD 2.3.2.219.  ON-TIME  STATUS  (5-position  N).  Indicates  the  total  status  received within  five  calendar  days.  These  data  are  accumulated  by  the  computer  on  the  routing identifier record for one year. 2.3.2.220.  OPERATIONAL  COST  RECOVERY.  Those  expenses  attributed  to  the operation  of  the  inventory  control  points.  These  costs  are  divided  into  two  categories:  Direct Allocatable Costs and Business Overhead Costs. 2.3.2.221.  ORDER AND SHIPPING (O&S) DAYS (4-position binary).  Indicates the accumulated  total  of  pipeline  time  for  all  receipts  received  within  175  percent  of  the standard  time  frame  for  the  UMMIPS.  These  data  are  accumulated  by  the  computer  on the  routing  identifier  record  and  are  used,  along  with  the  on-  time  or  delayed  receipts UMMIPS standard data, to determine the average order and shipping time. 2.3.2.222.  ORDINAL  DATE  (5-position  N).  Identifies  the  year  and  day  of  the  year. Positions 1-2 contain the year, and positions 3-5 contain the day of the year. For example, if the calendar date is June 1, 1987, the ordinal date will be 87162 (1987 = 87, June 1 = the 162nd day). Both the ordinal date and the Julian date identify the year and day of the year.  The  ordinal  date  contains  a  two-  position  year,  and  the  Julian  a  one-position  year (ordinal--87162, Julian-- 7162). 64 AFH23-123  8 AUGUST 2013 2.3.2.223.

MILSTRIP  Project  Codes  are available http://www.dla.mil/j-6/dlmso/eLibrary/ServicePoints/allpoc.asp https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af/USAF/ep/globalTab.do?channelPageId=s6925EC1357A90FB5E044080020E329A9 (access to information is restricted via CAC)        Notes:      1.  Location. The project code  will  be  entered  in  positions  57-59  on  requisitions,  shipments,  and  related transactions.  If  no  project  code  applies,  positions  57-59  will  be  left  blank.  The  use  of these  positions  for  theater  and  regional  purposes  is  prohibited.  Major  commands  and bases  will  not  enter  locally-assigned  codes  to  highlight  mission  capability,  special processing  characteristics,  etc.,  within  the  theater,  major  commands,  or  bases.        2.  Relationship  to  Priority  and  Supply  Decisions.  Project  codes,  other  than  OSD/JCS assigned  codes,  neither  provide  nor  imply  any  priority  or  precedence  for  requisition processing  and  Supply  decision-making.  Therefore,  project  codes  will  never  alter  or override the priority assigned to a requisition or shipment. Requisitions containing project codes  will  be  processed  according  to  the  assigned  PRIORITY  DESIGNATOR  as prescribed in the UMMIPS. 2.3.2.247.  PROJECT  FUNDS  MANAGEMENT  RECORD  (PFMR)  CODE  (3-position  N).  Identifies the PFMR and the subdivision of available funds designated for the  purchase  of  materiel  from  divisions  of  the  Air  Force  SMAG.

Identifies  the  total number  of  WRM  assets  required  on  a  weapon  system,  subsystem,  or  end  item,  or  the quantity required to swap-out a subsystem. 70 AFH23-123  8 AUGUST 2013 2.3.2.253.  QUANTITY  PURCHASE  VARIATION  CODE  (1-position  A).  Used  on Local Procurement Status (LPS) transactions to indicate why the quantity supplied by the vendor is not the same as the quantity requested. For codes applicable to local purchase items. Also, called Quantity Variation Code. This code is stored on the status detail. Table 2.55.  Quantity Purchased Variation Codes. Code P Q T V Description The standard unit of packaging is different from the quantity requisitioned. The standard package nearest the requested quantity is being purchased. No one vendor can supply the full quantity requisitioned. Part of the request will be purchased from the vendor who has the largest quantity available. Note:  If the customer still needs the unfilled quantity, contact the Base Contracting Office for details and submit new requisition(s). Prevents automatic decrease of the unit price on the item record for purchases that involve unusual circumstances such as; extra discounts, etc. Authorized variation in quantity according to FAR. For some commodities, Contracting may vary the quantity, not to exceed 10 percent above or below the requisitioned quantity. 2.3.2.254.  QUANTITY  UNIT  PACK  (QUP)  CODE  (1-position  A/N).  Indicates  the number of units normally contained in the packaging container. For example, if an item has a unit of issue of gallons and normal container of 55 gallons in a drum, the QUP code will be M. If the unit of issue for this same item is drum, the QUP code will be 1. If no QUP  code  identifies  the  specific  unit  pack  quantity,  the  code  identifying  the  quantity nearest to the unit pack will be used. The list of QUP codes is provided in DoD 4100.39-M, Vol 10. 2.3.2.255.  QUANTITY  VARIANCE  FLAG  (1-position  A).  Also  called  Local Purchase  Variance  Flag.  Identifies  the  type  of  variance  between  the    quantity  received and the original requested quantity. The use of these codes as defined below is peculiar to SBSS  Receipt  and  Status  processing.  Also,  called  Local  Purchase  Variance  Flag.  This code  differs  from  the  2  position  coded  percentage  Quantity  Variance  used  in  DLM 4000.25-5,  Military  Standard  Contract  Administration  Procedures  (MILSCAP)  to identify the variation in quantity authorized by a contract. Table 2.56.  Quantity Variance Flag. Flag Codes O = Overage S = Shortage Definition The Overage flag is used to identify the quantity received on a Non-Local Purchase Receipt is greater than that ordered or shown on shipping document. Also known as the Over/Short flag The Shortage flag is used to identify the quantity received Non-Local Purchase Receipt is less than the quantity shown on the hipping document. Also known as the Over/Short flag AFH23-123  8 AUGUST 2013 71 E = Excess F = Final P = Partial T = Shortage If the Due-in quantity received is greater than the quantity requisitioned but equal to the quantity shipped, an excess receipt exists. Used on Local Purchase Receipts when a quantity variance is authorized on the local purchase status (LPS) detail. The prepared receipt input may contain a variance flag of either F to represent the final local purchase receipt for the open  due-in.  If left blank this field is updated under program control Used on Local Purchase Receipt due-ins when the quantity received is less than the quantity requisitioned but equal to the quantity shipped.  If left blank this field is updated under program control. Assigned under program control to Received But Not Billed(RNB) Detail, 213 claims payable record to indicate the RNB Detail was created as a result of TAR Processing. When the 213-OVER-SHORT-FLG contains a T, the quantity reflected in the 213- QTY-OVER-SHORT- field is the shortage quantity.   2.3.2.256.  READINESS  BASED  LEVEL  (RBL)  (Type  Level  F).  A  centrally computed adjusted stock level that is pushed from the AFMC Readiness Based Leveling (D035E) system on a quarterly basis. Item records with an RBL will be identified via the D028-Level-Flag  on  the  item  record.  When  loaded,  an  RBL  becomes  the  base’s peacetime  requirement  and  therefore  becomes  both  the  demand  level  and  the requisitioning objective. 2.3.2.257.  REASON  FOR  DISPOSAL  CODE  (1-position  A/N).  Provides  the  LRS CC/AO  meaningful  data  for  analysis  of  Air  Force  transfers  to  the  DLADS.  See  Para.  2.15. for additional information. 2.3.2.258.  REASON  WHY  CODE  (1-position  A).  Indicates  why  an  item  record  has been  loaded,  changed,  or  deleted.

No TAC codes will be assigned to any ANG shipments (from or to ANG accounts) where the DoDAAC equals F_6000 to F_6599.  2.  The last digit on the TAC is 0 (zero). 3.  FSC 1740, 3920 and 3950 are in both AGE and vehicles categories. The SBSS will assign TAC F8WR for Budget Code “V” and "Y", with ERRCD NF5 and ND5 (Vehicles), and TAC F8HA for budget codes A, M, and Y (with any other ERRCD). 4.  TAC F8PD is restricted to supporting the Harvest Falcon/Harvest Eagle Program (Formerly Southwest Asia) only. 5.  All A5(x) including TRM/A5J. 6.  The TAC is assigned only to those A2*/A4*/A5* where the first position of the document number equals E or F. 2.5.  Document Identifier Code (DIC) And Transaction Identification Code (TRIC) 2.5.1.  Document Identifier Code (3-position A/N). 2.5.1.1.  Purpose.  To  identify  external  transactions  (requisition,  referral  action,  status, follow-up, cancellation, etc.) to the system they apply to and to indicate the purpose and use of the data as intended by the operation. The SBSS will recognize these codes under program control, select the appropriate programs, and react to the data. 2.5.1.2.  Assignment.  The  DOD  controls  assignment  of  the  first  character.  Alphabetic characters  A  and  B  are  assigned  to  the  Supply  distribution  systems  for  MILSTRIP. 108 AFH23-123  8 AUGUST 2013 Alphabetic characters X, Y, and Z are provided as variable codes. These variables may be used in any or all systems, but only under restrictive conditions. 2.5.1.3.  MILSTRIP.  Document  identifier  codes  must  be  entered  on  all  requisitions  and related products entering the Supply distribution systems under MILSTRIP, according to the following rationale. 2.5.1.3.1.  Position 1 assignments. 2.5.1.3.1.1.  Alphabetic  A  identifies  transactions  related  to  Requisitioning  /Issue systems, regardless of service or the items within that service. 2.5.1.3.1.2.  Alphabetic B and X identify transactions related to Inventory Control systems  within  services/agencies.  Each  service  may  develop  and  assign  these codes. 2.5.1.3.1.3.  Alphabetic  C  identifies  transactions  related  to  the  Defense  Logistics Agency's Inventory Control System. 2.5.1.3.1.4.  Alphabetic  X  and  Y  facilitate  service  assignment  of  codes  to transactions necessary to internal depot, supply source, or base operations but not directly related to paragraphs above. Transactions containing codes Y and Z in the first position may never appear on any documents passed beyond the confines of a base, depot, or equivalent. 2.5.1.3.1.5.  Alphabetic  D  and  all  other  alphabetics  not  mentioned  above  are reserved  for  future  assignment  by  the  Department  of  Defense.  These  codes  will not  be  used  by  the  military  services  or  the  Defense  Logistics  Agency  until assigned by DOD. 2.5.1.3.2.  Position  2  assignments.  The  second  position  may  contain  alphabetic  or numeric entries. 2.5.1.3.3.  Position  3  assignments.  The  third  position  may  contain  alphabetic  or numeric  entries.  If  position  1  contains  alphabetic  A  on  requisitions,  referral  orders, redistribution orders, and materiel release orders, the character in position 3 (numeric or  alphabetic)  will  indicate  the  content  of  the  stock  or  part  number  field.  For  these transactions, the following guidelines will apply: 2.5.1.3.3.1.  Any  numeric  will  signify  that  an  overseas  consignee  is  to  receive shipment of the materiel. 2.5.1.3.3.2.  Any  alphabetic  will  signify  that  a  CONUS  consignee  is  to  receive shipment of the materiel. 2.5.2.  Transaction Identification Code (3-position A/N). 2.5.2.1.  Purpose.  To identify internal transactions within the SBSS (issue,  turn-in, due-in, due-out, report, file maintenance, inventory, etc.), and to indicate the purpose and use of the data as intended by the operation. The SBSS computer will recognize these codes under program control, select the appropriate programs, and react to the data. 2.5.2.2.  Assignment. The possibility of misusing a DOD/AFMC document identifier as a transaction  identifier  must  be  avoided.  For  this  reason,  some  transactions  containing AFH23-123  8 AUGUST 2013 109 TRIC codes may never appear on any document passed beyond the limits of the Standard Base Supply System. 2.5.3.  Codes and Explanation. The following table lists DIC/TRIC codes used in the SBSS, along with titles and references where the applicable formats may be found. Table 2.98.  DIC/TRIC Codes Chart.

An item assigned EMC 1 in the cataloging system for which an Air Force base desires visibility for local use. SBSS accounting will be maintained but will not be reported to the USAF Equipment Data Bank. An item which requires SBSS accounting and reporting to the USAF Equipment Data Bank but does not justify transaction reporting. Overlay type reporting to the USAF Equipment Data Bank is required. An item of such logistics significance that transaction reporting to the Equipment Data Bank is required. An item requiring EMC 4 accounting/reporting except the individual assets will be identified by a serial or registration number. Note: 1.  In the above, INVEST/EXP indicates an item's monetary value and, in most cases, the source of funding. Investment (INVEST) indicates an expensive item. When the LRS/Materiel Management Activity issues these items, there will be some form of accounting for the items. In most cases, investment items are paid for by the depot, MAJCOM, or Air Force. Expense (EXP) AFH23-123  8 AUGUST 2013 153 indicates an inexpensive item. When the LRS/Materiel Management Activity issues these items, no accounting is required except for XF items. Expense items are paid for with base-level funds (organization). 2.  For equipment items, the last position will contain the EMC. These codes are pushed by the item manager, except EMC 2 which is major command directed. EMC codes apply as explained above in Table 2.106. 2.8.

Assignment  (2-position  A/N).    Type  transaction  phrases  and  codes  are  assigned  to simplify the process of identifying transactions, since several types of action can be taken on a single input. Without a TTPC the user must make a detailed analysis of the entire record to determine the type of transaction taking place. The type transaction code is printed and stored on the transaction history record. 2.11.3.  Codes Explanation. Table 2.112.  Type Transaction Phrase and Code (TTPC).

The  shop  code  and custody  Receipt  account  code  are  synonymous  within  the  SBSS;  they  are  distinguishable only by  their  application. Each organization assigns  and  controls  these codes to  identify its own functions. These codes appear in positions 5 and 6 of the organization document number and must not be duplicated within the same organization. Some of these codes are required for specific inputs. For example, code NS must be used on FCH inputs for identity changes. However, this does not prevent organizations from duplicating this code for other functions.

Indicates  either  a  reject  or  the  action  status  and  other  information  on  an excess  report  and  related  documentation  from  the  DLA/GSA  and  the  national  inventory control point (NICP). The S series rejects excess transactions. The T series gives information about the action status of excess transactions. Also, see DoD 4100.39-M. Table 2.119.  Excess Status Codes. Code SA SB SC SD Explanation/Processing Action EXPLANATION: Rejected. If appropriate, resubmit with exception information as required by the instructions distributed separately by ICP. Assign a new document number if a new report is submitted.  PROCESSING ACTION:  The computer attempts to locate the corresponding excess detail. If the detail is found, the computer outputs an I107 management notice and deletes the detail. If re-reporting is required, process FEX with TEX code C and load EEC code 6 to item record, if applicable. If no detail is found, no action is taken on the input. EXPLANATION: Rejected. Report garbled, incomplete. Corrective actions cannot be determined. Review contents; correct and resubmit if appropriate. Assign a new document number if a new report is submitted. Also provided in response to MILSBILLS (DIC) FTP, Follow-up for Credit. Indicates the supply source has no matching document on file. Research, correct, and resubmit, if appropriate. If the transaction is valid, then contact the Materiel Returns POC through the DLA Customer Support Network, 1-877-DLA-CALL (1-877-352-2255).  PROCESSING ACTION: The computer attempts to locate the corresponding excess detail. If the detail is found, the computer flags the item record for releveling, creates a TTPC 5U transaction history, and deletes the detail. If no detail is found, no action is taken on the input. EXPLANATION:  Rejected. ICP of the reported item cannot be determined. Research records and, if applicable, resubmit citing correct NSN. (Assign a new document number if a new excess report is submitted). If NSN is GSA managed, item is non-stocked; disposition is authorized under local directives. (Use to reject invalid FTE/FTP transactions). (Use on FTR).   PROCESSING ACTION:  The computer attempts to locate the corresponding excess detail. If the detail is found, the computer outputs an I043 management notice and deletes the detail. If no detail is found, no action is taken on the input. EXPLANATION:  Rejected. NSN is not identifiable. Corrective action cannot be AFH23-123  8 AUGUST 2013 211 determined. Review correct and resubmit, if appropriate. (Assign a new document number if a new excess report is submitted.) (Use to reject invalid FTE/FTF transactions.) (Use on FTR.)  PROCESSING ACTION:  The computer attempts to locate the corresponding excess detail. If the detail is not found, the computer outputs an I044 management notice and deletes the detail. If no detail is found, no action is taken on the input. EXPLANATION: FTL/FTM transaction received by the ICP identified in positions 4-6. FTL/FTM does not match a report of excess at the ICP or the NSN in FTL/FTM cannot be identified. Review, correct, and resubmit if appropriate. (Used on FTR)  PROCESSING ACTION:  The computer attempts to locate the corresponding excess detail. If the detail is found, the computer outputs an I044 management notice and deletes the detail. If no detail is found, no action is taken on the input.  EXPLANATION: Rejected. The item is not in the authorized condition to be reported or the condition code cannot be identified. The materiel should be screened for correct condition and a new FTE submitted. If the item is not reportable, it should be disposed of according to current procedures. If a new excess report is submitted, assign a new document number.  PROCESSING ACTION: The computer attempts to locate the corresponding excess detail. If the detail is found, the computer outputs an I108 management notice and deletes the detail. If no detail is found, no action is taken on the input. If DLADS action is still required, process the TRM with an R in position 80. EXPLANATION: Rejected. This transaction is a duplicate of a previously submitted FTE.  PROCESSING ACTION: This code indicates a duplicate report of excess. No action is taken on this input. EXPLANATION: Rejected. The unit of issue is incorrect and cannot be converted or corrected. Assign a new document number if a new excess report is submitted.  PROCESSING ACTION: The computer attempts to locate the corresponding excess detail. If the detail is found, the computer outputs a I041 management notice and deletes the detail. If no detail is found, no action is taken on the input. EXPLANATION: Rejected. The signal code is incorrect.  PROCESSING ACTION: The computer attempts to locate the corresponding excess detail. If the detail is found, the computer flags the item record for releveling, creates a TTPC 5U transaction history, and deletes the detail. If no detail is found, no action is taken on the input. EXPLANATION: Rejected. The signal code requires a compatible fund code. Assign a new document number if a new excess report is submitted. PROCESSING ACTION:  Processing is the same as for status code SJ. EXPLANATION: Rejected. The dollar value of the reported excess is less than the minimum allowed by current instructions. Assign a new document number if a new SE SF SG SH SJ SK SL 212 SM SN SQ TA TB AFH23-123  8 AUGUST 2013 excess report is submitted.  PROCESSING ACTION: Processing is the same as for status code SJ. If DLADS action is still required, process the TRM with an R in position 80. EXPLANATION: Rejected. The stock balance indicates that disposal action is appropriate. However, the item is in the process of migrating, so further action is postponed until the date contained in positions 70-73 arrives. If the item is still in excess position after that date, resubmit to the appropriate item manager. Assign a new document number if a new excess report is submitted.  PROCESSING ACTION: The computer attempts to locate the corresponding excess detail. If the detail is found, the computer updates the follow-up date field with the date in positions 70-73 of the input FTR. An FTR/SM flag is also placed in the FTR/SM flag field of the excess detail. If the date is less than the current Julian date, the follow-up program deletes the excess detail and flags the item record for releveling, if required. If no detail is found, an FTC is output to cancel the excess report. EXPLANATION:  Rejected. The materiel reported is not authorized for return. (Used on FTR.)  PROCESSING ACTION:  The computer attempts to locate the corresponding excess detail. If the detail is found, the computer outputs an I148 management notice and deletes the detail. If no detail is found, no action is taken on this input. If DLADS action is still required, process the TRM with an R in position 80. EXPLANATION:  Rejected. The reported NSN is a master item number (that is, all makes and models) used for reference purposes only. (Used on FTR.)  PROCESSING ACTION:  Review the records and resubmit with a new document number, citing the appropriate NSN for the specific item being reported. EXPLANATION:  Creditable return. Credit will be granted for the quantity indicated in positions 25-28. Ship materiel to the activity indicated in positions 54-56. (Used on FTR.)  Note:  The quantity shipped is the serviceable balance minus the requisition objective, but it cannot be greater than the input quantity.  PROCESSING ACTION:  The computer directs the shipment of property with reimbursement, outputs a reimbursable shipment, creates TTPC 1A/3S and 2H transaction histories, creates a shipped-not-credited detail, and outputs shipment suspense (SSC). DD Form 1348-1A will be output on the appropriate warehouse terminal. The computer also attempts to locate the corresponding excess detail. If the detail is found and the suffix is blank, the excess detail is deleted. If the suffix code is not blank, the quantity shipped is subtracted from the excess detail and the result, if positive, remains on file. Otherwise, the detail is deleted. If the detail is not found, an FTC is output to cancel the reported excess.   EXPLANATION:  Non-creditable return. Return the quantity indicated in positions AFH23-123  8 AUGUST 2013 213 25-29 to the activity in positions 54-56. (Used on FTR or FT6.)  The quantity shipped is the serviceable balance minus the group total requirement, but the quantity shipped cannot be greater than the input quantity.  PROCESSING ACTION:  The computer directs the shipment of property with no reimbursement, creates a shipment suspense detail, and outputs an SSC. The computer also attempts to locate the corresponding excess detail. If an excess detail is located and the requisition objectives is not zero, or the cumulative recurring demand is not zero and the DATE-SPC- ASSIGNED is less than 730 days, an FTC will be output and the excess report detail will be deleted from the field. (See note.) If a detail is found and the suffix code is blank, the excess detail is deleted and a shipping document is output on the appropriate warehouse terminal. If the suffix code is not blank, the input quantity is subtracted from the excess detail and the remainder, if positive, is written back on file. Otherwise, the detail is deleted. If no detail is found, an FTC is output to cancel the reported excess. Note:  For budget code 8 (XB3, XF3) and budget code 9 (XB3 and NF1 - IEX 3, 6, E, K), the retention criteria will be 365 days for mission impact code of 3, 4, or blank. These criteria are based on the DATE-SPC-ASSIGNED date. MIC 1 and 2 assets will use 730 days (two years) from the DATE-SPC-ASSIGNED date to determine the retention criteria.  EXPLANATION:  Not returnable. The quantity indicated in positions 25-29 is in excess of the authorized retention levels. Further processing must proceed according to appropriate service regulations. (Used on FTR.)  PROCESSING ACTION: The computer attempts to locate the corresponding excess detail. If the detail is found, the computer performs requirements computation to determine the current inventory position for the entire ISG. If the on-hand serviceable balance is considered total excess, and if all the processing edits and conditions required for serviceable transfers are, the input quantity is transferred to DLADS. If the detail is not found, the input is ignored. Note:  See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 6  for additional processing actions for excess status code TC. The area covers the logic used for Materiel Returns FTR inputs when shipment action is authorized to transfer items to DLADS. It applies to items that are budget 9. EXPLANATION:  Not returnable. 1) Special instructions for disposition are stated in the remarks field (continued on the reverse side). In this case, the status output will be submitted. Code TD will not be used when other status codes have been established to communicate applicable status. 2) For reasons of security or due to space limitations, instructions must be provided by separate communication. The communication will refer to the specific document number. When separate communication is to be used and this status code is provided, the remarks block will be blank. (Used on FTR.)  PROCESSING ACTION:  The computer attempts to locate the corresponding excess detail. If the detail is found, the computer outputs an I039 management notice. If no detail is found, the computer outputs an FTC to cancel the excess. If DLADS action is still required, process the TRM with an R in position 80. EXPLANATION:  Materiel required for lateral redistribution (Used on FTR.). TE is TC TD TE 214 TF TG TH TJ TK AFH23-123  8 AUGUST 2013 an intra-Air Force excess transaction code.

If no detail is found, no action is taken on the input. EXPLANATION:  Materiel received. The status is being investigated. (Used on FTR.)  PROCESSING ACTION:  The computer attempts to locate the corresponding shipped-not-credited detail for the input document number and suffix code. If the detail is found, the computer updates the date shipped field to reflect the current Julian date plus 30 days. This action prevents follow-up for 30 days. If no detail is found, no action is taken on the input. EXPLANATION:  Material required for lateral redistribution A4_referral(s) will follow, containing NSN and/or unit of issue as changed and as indicated in positions 8-22 and/or positions 23-23. (Used on FTR.)  PROCESSING ACTION:  Examine unit of issue and quantity fields for possible changes prior to Receipt of referral order(s). EXPLANATION:  Credit will be granted for the quantity in positions 25-28. The NSN and/or unit of issue are changed as shown in positions 8-22 and/or 23-23. The quantity field (25-29) is adjusted as required. Examine the unit of issue and quantity field for possible changes. Ship materiel to the activity in positions 54-56. (Used on FTR or FT6.)  PROCESSING ACTION:  The computer attempts to locate the corresponding excess detail. If the detail is found, the input NSN is matched to the excess detail NSN. If the NSNs are not equal, an I040 management notice is output. If the NSNs are equal, the retail supply system converts the excess status code TA, but processes the transaction as if the excess status code is TH. If the item record unit of issue and the input unit of issue are not equal, a 329 reject is output. After taking corrective action as indicated by reject 329, the input must be reprocessed. If no detail is found, an FTC is output to cancel the excess report.   EXPLANATION:  Non-creditable return. The NSN and/or unit of issue have been changed as shown in positions 8-22 and/or positions 23-23. Examine the unit of issue and quantity fields for possible changes. Return the quantity indicated in positions 25-29 to the activity indicated in positions 54-56. (Used on FTR or FT6.)

Almost all SBSS legacy  transactions  can  be  submitted  through  ES-S  using  simple  web  based  GUI  screens. This transaction processing capability allows authorized users to process transactions against one or more SBSS accounts without having to sign-on to each account separately. See  ES-S User’s Manual.      Note:  A screen feature exists on almost all of the screens to bring input data back on the screen after input. This feature is available whether the transaction processes or  rejects.  Position  cursor  at  the  top  of  the  screen  where  the  screen  number  is  shown  (i.e., 230 AFH23-123  8 AUGUST 2013 /083)  and  simply  replace  the  slash  (/)  with  an  ‘R’  (i.e.,  R083).  Then  enter  the  data  to  be reprocessed. This is particularly useful when multiple inputs must be processed. Table 2.124.  Screen Name/Number Index.

ECONOMIC ORDER QUANTITY (EOQ).  A variable requirement for an economic order and stockage program (EO&SP) item which is computed as a function of the cost to order, the cost to hold, the unit price, and the annual requirements rate. 2.23.2.31.  ENTERPRISE  SOLUTION  –  SUPPLY  (ES-S).  The Enterprise Solution – Supply  (ES-S)  is  one  of  three  components  of  the  Integrated  Logistics  System  –  Supply 244 AFH23-123  8 AUGUST 2013 (ILS-S). The other two components are the Standard Base Supply System (SBSS) and the AF Supply Central Databank (AFSCDB). ES-S is designed to leverage the services of the GCSS-AF integration  framework  (IF),  commercial-off-the-shelf  (COTS)  system development  tools,  and  custom  components  to  achieve  a  seamless  integration  and presentation of operational supply information. ES-S provides role-based security access through the AF Portal to all (approximately 300) instances of the Standard Base Supply System  (SBSS).  ES-S  also  provides  a  limited  interface  to  the  Stock  Control  System (SCS),  Defense  Logistics  Agency’s  (DLA)  Integrated  Data  Environment  (IDE), Integrated  Data  Environment/Global  Transportation  Network    Convergence  (IGC),  and the  DoD  Supply  Discrepancy  Reporting  (WebSDR)  system.    The  ES-S  user  interface (UI)  is  designed  to  make  over  300  SBSS,  SCS, and  DLA  accounts  look  and  feel  like  a single  system.  Once  the  user  accesses  ES-S  through  the  AF  Portal,  no  further  login  is required to access operational systems. SUPPLY (ES-S) – SOLUTION 2.23.2.32.  ENTERPRISE ASSET MANAGEMENT.  ES-S  asset  management  incorporates  the  tracking  and  Automatic Identification  Technology  (AIT)  capabilities  of  the  Standard  Asset  Tracking  System (SATS). ES-S provides an enterprise asset tracking capability that replaces the base level client/server architecture of SATS. The Handheld Terminal (HHT) application and HHT synchronization  with  ES-S  will  be  provided  by  the  Enterprise  Data  Collection  Layer (EDCL),  which  is  a  service  of  the  GCSS-AF  framework.  The  EDCL  functions  as  the enterprise  “SATS  Server”  that  will  provide  an  enterprise  view  of  assets  as  they  move through  the  warehouse  to  the  shelf  or  delivery  to  a  customer.  Ultimately  the  Vista Operating System will render SATS inoperable. Reference the ES-S Users Manual on the ES-S CoP for specific how-to information. 2.23.2.33.  EQUIPMENT APPROVAL AUTHORITY (EAA).

Serviceable turn-in of budget code 8, XD items originally issued as unserviceable using an Activity Code C are credited at exchange, while XF/XB returns with the same conditions are credited at LAC. 2. The following information applies: a. First the program will compute a value that equals the (requisitioning objective (RO) plus firm due-outs) minus (due-ins plus on-hand (DI plus OH)). This computed value is the maximum quantity that the customer will receive 100 percent credit. b. Next the program will compute the upper limit value which is (RO plus firm due-outs plus 730 times daily demand rate (DDR)) minus (DI plus OH). This value is the maximum quantity that can be given credit at this time which includes the quantity of items that can receive 100 percent credit. Any quantity being turned in that is greater than the upper limit value will receive no credit. c. To determine the additional percent of credit the program must look at the cumulative recurring demands (CRD) and subtract the turn-in quantity to determine the new CRD.  If the new CRD value is greater than or equal to 50, the quantity above the RO but below the upper limit value will receive 40 percent credit. d. If the new CRD value is between 1 and 50, 20 percent credit for items above the RO but below the upper limit value is granted. The quantity that will be credited at the 254 AFH23-123  8 AUGUST 2013 graduated percent is determined as follows: Upper limit quantity (see subparagraph b) minus the 100 percent credit quantity (see subparagraph a) equals the quantity credited at the graduated percent. e. If the new CRD value is zero, no credit will be given for the turn-in since the RO will also become zero unless there are firm due-outs. f. The final step is to determine the dollar value of credit being granted. The dollar value at 100 percent credit is determined by multiplying the quantity at 100 percent credit by the unit price. The dollar value of the additional percent credit is determined as follows: graduated percent credit quantity times the unit price times the graduated percent.  The total credit provided is the sum of the above computations. 3. The following information applies: a. Turn-in of budget code 9, XF items with a DIFM detail (minus those for DLA-DS withdrawals) are considered turn-ins with a sale, and will be credited 100 percent up to retention level (RO plus 730 times DDR minus (on hand, plus due-in, plus DIFM).  Turn-in of XF items without a sale (FOB or DRMO withdrawals) will be credited 100 percent up to the RO minus (on hand, plus due-in, plus DIFM assets) and 44 percent above the RO up to 730 times DDR minus (on hand, plus due-in, plus DIFM). b. Only grant any credit if the item will have a demand level after the processing the turn in transaction. So for Due-In From Maintenance (DIFM) items, if the CRD is greater than or equal to 1, credit is granted since the DIFM turn in will create a demand level. c. For non-DIFM, since the turn in does not generate a demand, the item must already have a demand level to be credited. Note FOB turn-ins do not count as demands.  Turn-ins to DLA-DS normally count as demands. d. In order to identify those turn-ins repaired as a result of a DRMS withdrawal, the DIFM should be coded to indicate the DIFM created was a result of an asset received from DRMS. e. The final step is to determine the dollar value of credit being granted. The dollar value at 100% credit is determined by multiplying the quantity at 100% credit by the unit price. The dollar value of the additional percent credit is determined as follows: graduated percent credit quantity times the unit price times the graduated percent. The total credit provided is the sum of the above computations. 4. Serviceable turn-in of retail sales items (IEX E or K) receive automatic credit at standard price. Local policy can override this. When the decision has been made to not allow credit, process the TIN input with credit code N. 5. The turn-in of alpha budget coded items does not update customer funds.  Table 2.133.
