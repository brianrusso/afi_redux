The pump is powered by an electrical motor.  5.1.13.1.3.1. Electric motor/hydraulic pump.  5.1.13.1.3.2. 24 volts direct current (Vdc).  5.1.13.1.3.3. Pressure ranges from 1,000 to 3,000 pounds per square inch (psi).  5.1.13.1.3.4. Provides normal steering/lift/suspension.  5.1.13.1.3.5. Minimum continuous operating time:  30 min.  5.1.13.1.4.  Steering.  Steering is controlled by the steering wheel and steering column connected to a hydraulic valve in the cab.  5.1.13.1.5.  Side shift and roll.  Side shift and roll functions are designed to assist in loading and unloading cargo.  Momentary switches in the cab/deck-mounted hydraulics control them.  Each switch electrically powers a control valve and allows hydraulic fluid to operate the cylinders.  5.1.13.1.6.  Power conveyor.  Power conveyors are hydraulically controlled and move the pallets across the deck surface.  The pallets move with the aid of nine individual conveyor selector switches.  The selectors allow the pallet to move either forward/aft.  Powered  conveyors  move  light  pallets  on  LOW  (under  3,000)  or  heavy  pallets  on HIGH (above 3, 000).  Directional controllers power pallets either fwd/aft or in/out.  5.1.13.1.7.  Lift linkage.  The lift linkage is the main system that moves the deck up and down.  The lift controller switch electrically powers controller switch electrically powers control valves and allows hydraulic fluid to operate the lift cylinders to raise and lower the deck.  Cylinder movement is directly related to placement of switch and rpm. Cylinder movement is controlled by an interim lower lift position provides slow cylinder movement and extreme lower/lift causes fast movement.  5.1.13.1.8.  Hydrostatic drive.  Provides a means for propulsion using a high pressure hydraulic system.  5.1.13.1.9.  Suspension.  Suspension on the loader provides for chassis height adjusting and load stability.  To adjust the suspension, move the selector switch to SUSPN and push the switch up or down depending on the direction the suspension needs to move.  Suspension switches are held until the chassis position indicator light is lit.  (For C130 loading, depress the override control while holding both suspension switches in the LOAD position.).  5.1.13.1.10. Cooling.  Cooling of the hydraulic system is provided by a cooling fan driven with a hydraulic motor at the heat exchanger.  Sensors monitor the hydraulic oil temperature and control the fans operation.  5.1.13.2.   Pneumatic system.  The loaders pneumatic system is both wet and dry based on standard automotive brake systems.  As the system produces air pressure, the air is dried through and air dryer.  Quick disconnects on air tanks provide air pressure for external use such as inflating tires.  Glad hands are mounted on the front of the loader and allow external air pressure to be connected for towing.  The four systems are charging, primary braking, secondary braking system and emergency breaking system.  5.1.13.2.1.  Charging  system.    This  system  produces  air  pressure  for  the  entire pneumatic  system.    The  system  contains  a  belt  driven,  governed  air  compressor, condenser, electric dryer, wet tank, and two holding tanks (primary and secondary).  5.1.13.2.2.  Primary brake system.  This system provides normal braking for the non-driven axles no, 1, 3, and 5.  The upper chamber of treadle (brake) valve controls the primary brake system.  The air pressure is monitored by 1 “AIR PRESS” gauge.  Left floor-mounted pedal in the cab.  5.1.13.2.3.  Secondary brake system.  This system provide braking for the drive axles #2 and #4.  The lower chamber of treadle (brake) valve controls the secondary brake system.  Air pressure monitored by 2 “AIR PRESS” gauge.  5.1.13.2.4.  Emergency brake system.  This system provides the parking brake and an emergency brake for system failures.  In the event of a failure, air is released from the emergency system and the brake chamber spring applies the parking brakes (30-50 psi).  5.1.13.3.   Electrical system.  This system is a 12/24 Vdc power system.  Power is generated by  a  200A  alternator  and  stored  in  four  batteries.    Major  components  of  the  electrical system not previously listed are A14 battery box, A12 module (winterization), A6 module (engine).  A1 module (chassis) and A16 module (emergency power unit circuit breaker box) A-19 module -12/24Vdc circuit box , A-20 -24 Vdc starter circuit breaker box, A-22 engine shutdown control.  5.1.13.3.1.  A pan liner is used to preheat the batteries for cold-weather starting.  The batteries are capable of delivering 1600 cold cranking amps (CCA) at 24 Vdc for engine starting and 25 A for 200 minutes at 24 Vdc for the emergency standby system.  5.1.13.3.2.  A14  battery  box.    The  loader  has  four,  12  Vdc  batteries  connected  to series/parallel to provide both slave cable, which allow use of an external power to assist in starting the loader.  Figure 5.7.  A14 Battery Box.     5.1.13.3.3.  A12 module.  The A12 module provides distribution/control of the loader winterization system.  The A12 module step-down transformer 220, 240V, 50-60 Hz input power.  With either power input power configuration, the winterization light, located  on  the  main  instrument  panel,  indicates  that  the  winterization  power  is connected is connected/applied.  5.1.13.3.4.  A6 Module.  The A-6 module is mounted near the engine, contains the electronic governor, start interlock circuit card, two circuit breakers, and an emergency shutdown switch, similar to the switch used on the cab’s main instrument panel.  5.1.13.3.4.1. The  start  interlock  circuit  card  inhibits  the  emergency  pump  from running when the engine is running and controls the emergency pump when the engine is not running.  The start inner lock circuit card also allows starter motor to engage only once until the engine stops spinning. 5.1.13.3.4.2. The start interlock card also allows start motor to engage only once until the engine stops spinning and prevents the injector from being operated when the engine temperature is above 55 degrees Fahrenheit. 5.1.13.3.4.3. Cold  weather  starting  aids  are  powered  by  110V,  50-60  Hz  input power.    5.1.13.3.4.4. Input power is distributed to the battery heaters, engine fuel heaters, engine coolant heater and pump, and ether bottle heater.  Note:  Ensure the power cord  is  disconnected  from  the  loader  prior  to  driving  away.    There  is  a  switch located on the module for emergency shutdown.  5.1.13.3.5.  A1 module.  The module is the brain center for the hydraulic system.  It contains an emergency shutdown switch, emergency pump switch, six circuit breakers, and all necessary relays for hydraulic system operation.  5.1.13.3.5.1. The emergency shutdown switch, similar to the switch used on the cab’s main instrument panel, allows emergency engine shutdown while personnel are on the ground near the engine.  It applies 24 Vdc batter power to the emergency pump.  5.1.13.3.5.2. System  interlocks  prevent  emergency  pump  operation  when  the engine is running.  5.1.13.3.6.  A16 module.  The A16 module is located under the A14 battery box and contains  a  circuit  breaker  that  protects  the  standby  emergency  power  unit  from overheating.  It can be tripped to disable a runaway emergency power unit.  5.1.13.3.7.  A-19  Module  –  A-19  Module  located  next  to  the  A14  battery  box  and contains two circuit breakers that protect 12 Vdc and 24Vdc power for the entire loader, excluding the engine starter’s circuit.  The circuit breakers should be turned off in an electrical  emergency,  if  the  loader  will  not  be  used  for  an  extended  period,  or  for maintenance.   5.1.13.3.8.  A-20 module.  The A-20 Module is located next to the A-6 engine box and contains a circuit breaker that protects the 24Vdc engine starter circuit.  The circuit breaker should be turned off in an electrical emergency or for engine maintenance.  5.1.13.3.9.  A-22 module.  The A-22 Module is mounted behind the A-6 engine box, contains  electronics  circuitry  that  monitors  engine  temperatures,  oil  pressure,  and coolant  levels.    This  system  will  automatically  shut  down  the  engine  when  engine temperature exceeds 210°F oil pressure is below 4 psi, or engine coolant level is 10 quarts below full.

Driving Safety and Precautions.  5.4.1.  Operators are required to become familiar with the safety precautions and location and use  of  controls,  accessories,  indicators  and  handling  characteristics  of  the  loader  prior  to attempting any operation or service procedures.  Note:  In addition to the guidance below, refer to  the  manufacturer’s  operator’s  manual  in  order  to  familiarize  the  trainee  with  all warnings/cautions  for  the  vehicle  being  operated  and  continue  to  emphasize  throughout training.  5.4.2.  Adequate space.  The overall length and width of the loader requires that the loader has adequate space for maneuvering.  Operate the loader at a safe distance behind other vehicles.  Be aware of the location of all personnel in the general vicinity while operating the loader and/or deck controls.  5.4.3.  Tail swing.  Tail swing is the number one cause of the avoidable structural damage to the Tunner.  The unique turning style of the Tunner is cause for caution while operating the vehicle.  Synchronized and articulated creates the 60K’s comparatively small 50-foot turning radius.  This causes the loader to produce a tail swing of up to 6 feet.  Operators should not attempt to turn right for U-turns when the Tunner is loaded with cargo.  There is a 10 ft. tail swing.    5.4.4.  Off-road  driving.    Drive  carefully  on  uneven,  wet  or  slippery  surfaces.    For  more information on off-road driving and safe vehicle operation guidance, refer to AFMAN 24-306.  5.4.5.  High winds.  High wind conditions may cause the deck to sway.  Note:  CAUTION – Personnel must exercise caution when standing on the elevated deck if winds are above 40 knots.  5.4.6.  Do not attempt to drive the loader with the low air buzzer and indicator on.  5.4.7.  Come to a complete stop before repositioning the drive switch.  Warning:  CAUTION – If oil pressure drops below 5 psi, stop engine immediately to prevent damage caused by lack of lubrication.  5.4.8.

Observe all flightline traffic rules.  5.4.13.  Foreign Object Damage (FOD).  Vehicle operators will remove FOD from tires during daily the vehicle inspection.  Before entering the airfield, a physical check for loose/unsecured objects and an inspection of the tire treads for FOD will be accomplished, with the exception of emergency vehicles responding to actual situations.  5.4.13.1.   Any vehicle which has been driven on an unpaved surface will have a tire FOD inspection accomplished prior to re-entering the airfield area.  Vehicles that frequent the flight line will be equipped with a FOD picker and a covered FOD container. 5.4.13.2.   FOD picker will be etched with the vehicle number painted on red or orange (or have a red streamer attached). 5.4.13.3.   FOD picker will be annotated on vehicle inspection form. 5.4.13.4.   FOD containers will be identified with the letters "FOD" and will be emptied daily.      5.4.13.5.   FOD checks are performed so that aircraft damage can be kept at a minimum.  5.4.14.  Spotter safety.  Many injuries and deaths have occurred from improper use of spotters.  A spotter will be used when the vehicle is within 15 feet of any stationary vehicle or obstacle or when the driver’s view is obstructed, regardless of the level of experience of the operator.  See AFMAN 24-306 for additional spotter safety guidance and spotter hand signals.  5.4.14.1.   While under the direction of the spotter, the operator must maintain positive visual contact with the spotter at all times.  5.4.14.2.   If at any time the operator loses sight of the spotter or cannot understand the spotter’s directions, the operator shall immediately stop the loader until positive visual contact is made.  5.4.14.3.   The spotter will stand to the rear of the loader, but not directly behind loader, in a position easily seen by operator. 5.5. Vehicle Operation.  5.5.1.  Engine starting.

Overview.    The  Series  900  Mercedes  Benz  equipped  loader  has  many  unique characteristics.  Be vigilant when operating this loader and know the difference between the Detroit 53 requirements and that of the Series 900.  5.6.2.  Engine characteristics.  5.6.2.1.  The Series 900 Mercedes Benz engine is a 440 cubic inch inline 6 cylinder 4 stroke diesel.  The rpm range is 1,000 to 2,200 rpm.  Engine is governed at 2,200 rpm.  5.6.2.2.  The loader can perform missions in ambient temperatures from -40°F to +125°F.  5.6.2.3.  Winterization system.  Heats 4 items:  5.6.2.3.1.   Grid heater.  5.6.2.3.2.   Coolant heater.  5.6.2.3.3.   Circulation pump.  5.6.2.3.4.   Battery warmer.  Note:  Do not use ether on this loader.   5.6.2.4.  The A6 box has been removed and replaced by a charge pump heat exchanger used to cool hydraulic fluid.  5.6.2.5.  Oil level dipstick is now located above the hydraulic fluid reservoir and is colored red.  15W40 oil only to be added by maintenance.  5.6.2.6.  If engine oil pressure drops below 7 psi, the engine will stop to prevent damage.  Normal oil pressure will be between 60 and 65 psi.  5.6.2.7.  Do not operate the starter for more than 20 seconds or it will overheat.  Allow 1 minute for starter to cool before attempting to start again.  5.6.2.8.  Emergency stop from the A6 box has been relocated to the left side of the loader behind the hydraulic fluid reservoir.  5.6.2.9.  Coolant  level  is  checked  at  the  sight  gauge  on  the  surge  tank.    The  coolant overflow reservoir is now located behind the radiator and is now only for overflow.  This is no longer a fill point or level check.  5.6.2.10.   There  is  a  new  digital  display  module  located  where  tachometer  used  to  be displays critical engine information.  Do not change the settings.  5.6.3.  Cold weather starting.  5.6.3.1.  Do not use ether to start a Series 900-equipped loader.  A grid heater is used to heat the air intake and could ignite ether before entering the engine.  5.6.3.2.  “Wait to start preheat” – This message will show on the electronic display for up to 40 seconds.  5.6.3.3.  If the wait to start message does not go off after 40 seconds, the grid heater is malfunctioning and Vehicle Management needs to be notified.  5.6.4.  Hydraulic operation.  5.6.4.1.  New hydraulic manifold on the left side of the loader.  5.6.4.2.  New lines in front of the hydraulic coolant fan.  5.6.4.3.  Single hydraulic system pump controls all deck suspension functions.  5.6.4.4.  When in DECK mode, the loader will automatically rev to 1,800 rpm.  The throttle pedal now controls the hydraulic flow only.  5.6.4.5.  When MODE selector switch is set to suspension, engine speed is set to 1,000 rpm.  Throttle will control hydraulic flow but not engine speed.  5.6.4.6.  There is no crossover switch or splitter box on the Mercedes equipped loader due to the fact that all hydraulics are now controlled by a single hydraulic drive pump assembly.  The absence of the splitter box has resulted in a greater quantity of fluid in the tank.  5.6.4.7.  The hydraulic fluid sight gauge is not calibrated for the new system.  5.6.5.  Hydrostatic Drive.  5.6.5.1.  Single hydrostatic drive pump controls both the number 2 and the number 4 drive axle lines.  5.6.5.2.  The new loader accelerates more quickly than the Detroit 53-equipped loader.  5.7. Tunner (60K) Loader Transport.  5.7.1.  Transport  by  Air.    The  loader  is  designed  for  drive  on/off  capability  for  air transportation.  5.7.1.1.  On the C-5 and C-17, the loader deck and bogies can be reconfigured to reduce loader width.  5.7.1.1.1.   This includes spinning the bogies 180°, taking the handrails off and storing them on the loader, folding the catwalk over, removing the ladder and sliding the cab in order to be flush with the deck.  5.7.1.1.2.   It takes 3 people approximately 2 hours to complete the reconfiguration.  C-5 and C-17 aircraft are wide enough so the loader can be driven directly on/off the aircraft.  5.7.1.1.3.   Bogie reconfiguration.  Bogie reconfiguration is only necessary for ground transport.  5.7.1.2.  Deck and cab reconfiguration.  Deck and Cab reconfiguration is only necessary for ground transport.  5.7.1.3.  Weighing  the  loader.    The  loader  must  be  weighed  before  air  transport.    Ten 10,000 pound capacity platform scales with ramps are used to determine the weight of each dual wheel assembly.  Note the differences in the following procedures for weighing the loader  in  the  air  transport  configuration  or  in  the  curb  (normal  use  C-5  and  C-17) configuration.  To weigh the loader, proceed as follows:  Note:  Weigh the loader at the same suspension height that will be used when the loader is on the aircraft.   5.7.1.3.1.   Aircraft loading.  Refer to T.O. 36M2-3-35-11 for more information.  5.7.1.3.1.1.  In transport mode, use minor steering adjustments to prevent wheel contact with chassis rail or loader components.  5.7.1.3.1.2.  Driver should be aware of air pressure for brakes at all times.  5.7.1.3.1.3.  Loader suspension should be adjusted as necessary to ensure clearance and contact of all tires on surface of ramp at all times.  5.7.1.3.1.4.  Release parking brake and use park brake override switch to adjust suspension height inside aircraft.  5.7.1.3.1.5.  With suspension isolation valves closed, hydraulic fluid pressure will increase or decrease relative to ambient temperature.  This pressure variation may cause tie-downs to tighten (hot) or loosen (cold) during travel.  5.7.1.3.1.6.  Closely  observe  hoses  on  bogies  #2  and  #4  to  avoid  dragging  on ground or interference with tires. 5.7.1.3.1.7.  Loader suspension may move when isolation valve is opened.  Ensure all personnel are clear of the loader to avoid injury.  5.7.1.3.1.8.  Watch  the  clearance  between  the  tire  and  chassis  and  between  the loader frame and aircraft ramp.  Watch the deck height at the rear of the loader to ensure the loader does not contact the aircraft. 5.7.1.3.1.9.  Removal of ladder will cause section to extend or retract and could cause injury.  Ensure ladder is held firmly prior to removing pins. 5.7.1.3.1.10. For clarification, the curbside of the loader is opposite the operator and street side is the operator side.     5.7.1.3.1.11. Tire  pressure  must  be  between  95  psi  and  100 psi.    Maximum  air transport weight is 68,000 lbs.  5.7.1.3.2.   Aircraft unloading.  Driving a reconfigured loader.  5.7.1.3.2.1.  In air transport mode, loader must be backed on and driven off aircraft.  In curb configured (normal operating) mode, loader must be driven on forward, and backed off aircraft.  Loader may also be driven forward off aft ramp of C-5 aircraft.  5.7.1.3.2.2.  Loader upper and lower suspension arms must point towards aircraft ramp.  The loader suspension system does not supply enough downward force when suspension arms point away from aircraft ramp and cause drive wheel to slip on the ramp.  5.7.1.3.2.3.  Use  minor  steering  adjustments  to  prevent  wheel  contact  with  the chassis rail or loader components.  5.7.1.3.2.4.  Driver should be aware of air pressure for brakes at all times.  5.7.1.3.2.5.  All  suspension  measurements  will  be  taken  from  the  amount  of exposed  cylinder  shaft.    Loader  suspension  should  be  adjusted  as  necessary  to ensure clearance and contact of all tires on surface of ramp at all times.  5.7.1.3.2.6.  All front suspension measurement will be taken from axle #1.  5.7.1.3.2.7.  All rear suspension measurement will be taken from axle #5.  5.7.1.3.2.8.  Release parking brake and use park brake override switch to adjust suspension height inside the aircraft.  5.7.1.3.2.9.  With suspension isolation valves closed, hydraulic fluid pressure will increase or decrease relative to ambient temperature.  This pressure variation may cause tie-downs to tighten (hot) or loosen (cold) during travel.  5.7.1.3.2.10. Closely observe hoses on bogies #2 and #4 to avoid dragging on the ground or interference with tires.  5.7.1.3.2.11. Watch deck height at rear of loader.  Ensure loader does not contact aircraft.  5.7.1.3.2.12. During  loader  movement,  watch  for  clearance  between  tire  and chassis and between loader frame and aircraft ramp.  5.7.1.4.1.   Deck  and  cab  reconfiguration.    Deck  and  cab  reconfiguration  is  only necessary for ground transport.  5.7.1.4.2.   Bogie  reconfiguration.    Bogie  reconfiguration  is  only  necessary  for  the smaller aircraft and ground transport.  5.7.1.4.2.1.  Closely observe hoses on bogies #2 and #4 to avoid dragging on the ground or interference with tires.  5.7.1.4.2.2.  Driver should be aware of air pressure for brakes at all times. 5.7.1.3.3.   Driving a loader off of a C-5 or C-17.  5.7.1.4.  Preparation  for  operation.    (Engine  Shutdown)    Perform  normal  operational shutdown.  If the temperature is expected to be below 32°F, connect the winterization plug to external power source.   5.7.1.4.2.3.  Isolation valves are located in front of each bogie.  5.7.2.  Transport by truck and hydrostatic drive deactivation/disengagement.  The Tunner can be transported by surface via low-boy semi-trailer.  This procedure is written for the double drop  stretch,  removable  gooseneck  trailer  with  a  53  foot  loading  space.    Three  axles  are required for both the tractor and trailer to support the weight of the loader.  Refer to T.O. 36M2-3-35-11 for guidance specific to the following means of transport by truck and hydrostatic drive:  5.7.2.1.  Driving on to a semi-trailer.  5.7.2.2.

Instructions.  Before beginning the performance test, the trainer will brief trainee on the scenario he/she will need to accomplish.  They will be given additional directions and instructions as needed while proceeding through the scenario.  A4.3.   Scoring.  A4.3.1.   The trainer examiner will be scoring on 60K-Loader operations and also the general safe driving practices.  The examiner will give directions and instructions to the trainee in sufficient time to execute a driving maneuver.  He/she will not be asked to drive in an unsafe manner.  A4.3.2.   The examiner will be making various marks on the performance test checklist.  This does not necessarily mean the trainee has done anything wrong.  It is in the best interest to concentrate on the operation of the 60K-Loader.  The trainer will explain the test results at the conclusion of the performance test.  A4.3.3.   Tasks being graded are listed on the following page; the trainee will be required to successfully pass all items.  A4.3.4.   The instructor will stop the test at any time safe 60K-Loader operations are not being followed or as deemed necessary for safety concerns.   A4.4.   Confidence Course Overview.  A4.4.1.   Introduction.  A4.4.1.1.   The Tunner loader confidence course was developed to allow supervisors and instructors flexibility in determining the current proficiency level and capabilities of new and  current  Tunner  operators.    The  confidence  course  focuses  on  the  unique  turning characteristics of the Tunner loader, but also addresses backing and spotting as well.  The course is used for Tunner loader students as an indoctrination tool and as a way to provide evaluation before licensing and semiannual recertification.  A4.4.1.2.   The  Tunner  loader  confidence  course  will  allow  students,  novice,  and experienced operators to refocus on areas they may be deficient in.  Operators must be aware of the hazards associated with right and left hand turns, rear end swing, and be able to accurately judge or determine the loader’s exact position while operating it.  A4.4.1.3.   The Tunner loader confidence course is set up in a closed environment. Traffic cones mark hazard areas and if knocked down, will identify to the operator and evaluator possible driving deficiencies.  In the final analysis, the course will reflect whether or not the  operator  has  the  tendency  to  over-steer  or  understeer  the  loader.    This  will  allow evaluators to have an established mechanism that could prevent potential accidents and identify problem areas.  A4.4.1.4.   It is imperative that supervisors use the Tunner loader confidence course as a means to provide positive feedback to their operators.  Most Tunner accidents have resulted because of poor or improper judgment or overconfidence on behalf of the Tunner operators.  A4.4.2.   Negotiating the Confidence Course.  A4.4.2.1.   The red arrows denote the first part of the course.  During this part of the course, the instructor will act as the spotter and spot the loader while the operator backs in between the first set of cones.  After operators have shown they can follow spotting directions and the Tunner’s cab is in line with the first cone, they will begin the clockwise portion of the course by following the blue arrows on the map.  After operators negotiate the clockwise portion of the course, they will follow the yellow transition arrows in the reverse direction and stop at the finish line.  A4.4.3.   How to Set-up the Confidence Course.  A4.4.3.1.   It is imperative that the course is set up in an area that has plenty of room; minimum area required is 362’ long by 114’ wide and free of congestion and traffic.  The area should be as flat as possible; topography has some effect on exact cone placement.  A4.4.3.2.   Course requires twenty-four, 28-inch standard traffic cones.  The 28-inch traffic cone will be the minimum height for cones used; the higher the cone the better visibility the operator will have, as well as a finer sense of the area he/she has to maneuver through.  A4.4.3.3.   The course should be set up in an area with a 362’ straight centerline.  This will enhance precise cone placement and will save time in setting up the course.  If the course is set up in a haphazard way or traffic cones are set up in general areas rather than precise locations, it will increase or decrease the difficulty in negotiating the course.  A4.4.4.   Testing.  A4.4.4.1.   Initial operators will practice their abilities on the confidence course. This will allow  them  to  focus  on  the  unique  turning  characteristics  of  the  Tunner  loader.    The instructor will ensure the schedule allows for sufficient time during the 10-day class to allow students maximum driving time.  Driving to a variety of aircraft, performing interface with highline docks, and driving the confidence course are great ways for the operator to receive balanced training.  The course is a good way to get critical driving experience when no aircraft are available.  A4.4.4.2.   Passing score will be mandatory for operators to initially receive Tunner on their  license.    All  operators  will  be  allowed  to  practice  two  runs  before  final  grading.  Instructors will allow the operator a maximum of two chances to demonstrate the ability to safely complete the course during grading.  A maximum of three cones can be hit during the test the fourth cone will result in a failure.  Operators performing their annual training requirements must meet the same standards; if a passing score is not achieved, the operator will not be allowed to drive the Tunner without a trainer present.  The Tunner QTP will be re-accomplished, followed by driving time with a trainer present until the operator can demonstrate the ability to safely maneuver the course within passing standards.    Figure A4.1.
