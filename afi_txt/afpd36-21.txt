AF Policy.  The AF shall: 1.1.  Ensure qualified Airmen with the needed skills are in the right job at the right time to meet the Air Force mission. 1.2.  Classify and assign Airmen as equitably as possible to ensure a high state of readiness. 1.3.  Provide special assignment  consideration for Airmen who have  family members with special medical or education needs. 1.4.  Whenever possible, to the maximum extent possible, assign individuals on a voluntary basis  and  in  the  most  equitable  manner  feasible  while  meeting  mission  and  commander needs. 1.5.  Ensure  involuntary  assignments  are  equitably  distributed  among  similarly  qualified Airmen, to minimize family separation and to avoid creating severe personal hardship. 1.6.  Establish  Active  Duty  Service  Commitments (ADSCs)  or  Reserve  Service Commitments (RSCs), when Airmen are reassigned on a fully funded permanent change of station, or public funds are used for education or training courses, to ensure a return on the investment. 1.7.  Compliance  with  utilization  and  classification  policy  will  be  assessed  by  measuring three areas: 1.7.1.  Vacant  positions.  The  Air  Force  goal  is  to  fill  all  funded  authorizations  with assigned Airmen. 1.7.2.  Time on Station (TOS).
