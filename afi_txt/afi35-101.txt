Purpose.  This instruction conveys guidance regarding Public Affairs (PA) capabilities used to  accomplish  diverse  communication  objectives  in  garrison  and  expeditionary  settings.    It requires  commanders  and  PA  professionals  to  deliver  truthful,  credible,  accurate,  and  timely information  to  various  audiences  to  enhance  awareness  and  understanding  of  the  Air  Force mission  and  contributions  to  national  security,  while  maintaining  due  regard  for  privacy  and operations  security.    Supporting  Department  of  Defense  (DOD)  and  joint  publications,  this document describes Air Force PA, its functional organization, and its capabilities at all levels.  It provides  PA  guidelines  for  all  Air  Force  military  and  civilian  personnel,  including  the  Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve.  This publication  may be supplemented at any  level, but all organizations must route their supplements to SAF/PAR for coordination prior to certification and approval.  (T-1) 1.1.1.  In  joint  and  combined  operations,  guidance  from  the  combatant  command  takes precedence over this instruction.  If conflicts arise between the content of this publication and those  of  DOD  PA  directives,  the  DOD  directives  take  precedence  for  the  activities  o f  joint forces  unless  the  Secretary  of Defense  has provided  more  current  and specific  guidance. 1.1.2.  Communication is a leadership and command responsibility at all levels.  All Airmen, regardless  of  specialty,  should  understand  and  be  able  to  explain  how  they  contribute  to accomplishing the Air Force mission.  Whether representing their installation at a community function or representing  the  U.S.  in a  crisis or  contingency operation, all  Airmen are  front-line  ambassadors  for  the  Air  Force  and  DOD.    Telling  the  Air  Force  story  contributes  to mission accomplishment, aids  in public  understanding, and contributes to American  national security  through  demonstrations  of  restraint,  resolve,  and capability. 1.2.  Mission.  Air  Force  PA  advances  Air  Force  priorities  and  achieves  mission  objectives through  integrated planning, execution, and assessment of communication capabilities.  Through strategic  and  responsive  release  of  accurate  and  useful  information,  imagery,  and  musical products  to  Air  Force,  domestic,  and  international  audiences,  PA  puts  operational  actions  into context;  facilitates  the  development  of  informed  perceptions  about  Air  Force  operations;  helps undermine  adversarial  propaganda  efforts;  and  contributes  to  the  achievement  of  national, strategic,  and operational  objectives. 1.3.  Public  Affairs  Core  Competencies.  PA’s  four  core  competencies  describe  the  primary ways  PA contributes  to overall  mission  accomplishment. 1.3.1.  Trusted Counsel to Leaders.  PA delivers candid communication counsel and  guidance to commanders  and other  leaders. 1.3.1.1.  PA  analyzes  command  activities  from  the  perspective  of  the  general  public, providing  objective  counsel  to  leaders  regarding  proposed  courses  of  action,  policy decisions,  and potential  impacts  on stakeholders. 1.3.1.2.  PA  participates  in  communication  and  operational  planning,  identifies  and analyzes  key  issues,  develops  messages,  conducts  media  training,  reaches  specific publics, ensures legally mandated public involvement requirements are met, recommends    6  AFI35-101   12 JANUARY  2016 methods  of  delivery,  and  measures  and  evaluates  results.    PA  enables  leaders  to communicate  factual  and  timely  information  so  the  Air  Force,  Congress,  media,  and public  understand  how  Air  Force people and programs  contribute  to national  security. 1.3.2.  Airman  Morale  and  Readiness.    PA  activities  contribute  to  Airman  morale  and readiness—the foundation of all Air Force core competencies—by enabling Airmen and their family  members to better  understand  their roles and  how policies, programs, and operations affect  them. 1.3.2.1.  The  Air  Force  cannot  accomplish  its  mission  without  well-trained,  well-informed,  and  highly  motivated  people.  Timely,  relevant,  and  accurate  information  is  a force  multiplier  that  enhances  Airman  morale  and  readiness,  and  increases  A irmen’s effectiveness  as ambassadors  of the  organization. 1.3.2.2.  PA  provides  leaders  with  effective  and  efficient  two-way  communication  tools to build,  maintain,  and strengthen  morale  and readiness. 1.3.3.  Public  Trust  and  Support.    PA  strengthens  the  bonds  between  the  Air  Force  and  the public through open and honest dialogue and programs that communicate with communities, opinion  leaders,  decision  makers,  and the media. 1.3.3.1.  Public  trust  and  support  are  essential  to  ensuring  a  highly  trained  and  well-equipped air, space, and cyberspace  force.  PA assists  leaders  in developing themes and messages,  identifying  stakeholders,  selecting  methods  of  delivery,  and  establishing effective  two-way  communication  to  promote  public  understanding  and  support  of  t he Air  Force. 1.3.3.2.  PA builds trust and support through engagements that showcase the Air Force as a  community  partner  and  responsible  steward  of  public  resources.    Community engagement provides  firsthand opportunities  for  local public audiences to  learn about the quality and capability of our Airmen, weapons systems, and  the  important  missions they carry  out.    PA  Airmen  and  initiatives  have  a  key  role  in  the  development  of  mutually beneficial  relationships  with  community  members  and the  media. 1.3.4.  Global  Influence  and  Deterrence.    PA  directly  affects  adversary  operational environments  by  engaging  on  the  information  front  while  defending  our  own  informational centers  of  gravity. 1.3.4.1.  PA develops and implements communication strategies to inform  local, regional, national, and  international audiences about air, space, and cyberspace to enhance support from  allies  as  well  as  deter  and/or  advantageously  influence  enemy  actions.    Public opinion  and  reactions  from  world  leaders  to  news  coverage,  specifically  during contingencies  and  crises,  demonstrate  how  media  coverage influences  military operations. 1.3.4.2.  PA helps achieve operational objectives through global influence and deterrence, and by engaging directly with all  relevant publics through the   information environment.  It also  helps  Air  Force leaders  implement  the  national  strategy  of worldwide  engagement. the  Air  Force  core  missions  are 1.3.4.3.  PA  consistently  communicates  how indispensable  to  our  nation’s  ability  to  conduct  successful  military  operations.    The  Air Force core missions  are: AFI35-101  12 JANUARY 2016   7  1.3.4.3.1.  Air  and space superiority. 1.3.4.3.2.  Intelligence,  surveillance,  and reconnaissance. 1.3.4.3.3.  Rapid  global  mobility. 1.3.4.3.4.  Global  strike. 1.3.4.3.5.  Command  and control. 1.4.  Public  Affairs  Core  Processes.  The  PA  core  competencies  are  supported  by  10  core processes  that  comprise  an  effective  PA  program  and  yield  measurable  impacts  in  the achievement of the Air Force’s goals and objectives.  These core processes apply at all levels a nd should  be implemented  to the maximum  extent  possible. 1.4.1.  Provide commanders  feedback regarding the public  information environment  and the means  to use  it  as part of air,  space, and cyberspace  operations. 1.4.2.

Provide  PA training  to PA personnel  and to non-PA  personnel,  as needed. 1.5.  Air  Force  Public  Affairs  Programs.  The  Air  Force  conducts  comprehensive,  active  PA programs at all levels of command to provide service members, the public, Congress, community leaders,  and  the  media  accurate  and  official  information  contributing  to  awareness  and understanding  of the  Air  Force’s mission. 1.5.1.  In accordance with the DOD Principles of Information (Attachment 2),  it  is Air Force policy that commanders at all levels ensure a free flow of information in a timely, responsive manner,  consistent  with  security  and  privacy  statutes.    PA  practitioners  will  not  engage  in disinformation,  activities  to  misinform,  mislead,  cover  up,  or  deny  otherwise  releasable information.  (T-0) 1.5.2.  PA  programs  are  designed concerning: to increase  public  awareness  and  understanding   8  AFI35-101   12 JANUARY  2016 1.5.2.1.  Threats to  the United States,  its  interests, and the  need  for an Air Force capable of deterring,  responding  to, and prevailing  against  those  threats. 1.5.2.2.  The  relationship  of  the  Air  Force  to  the  other  military  services  of  the  United States and its  allies. 1.5.2.3.  The  day-to-day  activities  of  the  Air  Force  and  its  capabilities  to  support instruments  of national  power. 1.5.2.4.

The essential and unique capabilities of air, space, and cyberspace power and the Air  Force’s role  in  providing  for  America’s  defense. 1.6.  Public  Affairs  Activities.  PA  activities  include  functional  management,  communication planning  and  analysis,  security  and  policy  review,  media  operations,  community  engagement, environmental,  visual  information,  band  operations,  contingency  operations  and  wartime readiness,  and command  information. 1.6.1.  Public  Affairs  Functional  Management.    PA  functional  management  ensures  the  PA office  and assigned personnel  are  resourced, trained, equipped, and  ready to accomplish the mission  in  garrison  or deployed.   See Chapters  2-5 for  more  information. 1.6.2.  Communication  Planning.    Communication  planning  is  important  to  the  creation  of strategic,  operational,  and  tactical  effects  in  PA  operations.    For  more  information  on communication  planning  and analysis,  see Chapter 6, Communication  Planning. 1.6.3.  Security and Policy Review.  While adhering  to the policy of  “maximum disclosure, minimum  delay,”  PA  ensures  information  intended  for  public  release  neither  adversely affects national security  nor threatens the safety, security, or privacy of Air Force personnel.   In  accordance  with  DOD  and  Air  Force  policies,  information  is  not  withheld  from  release merely  to  protect  the  Air  Force  from  criticism  or  embarrassment.    Refer  to  AFI  35-102, Security and Policy Review Process, for  additional  information. 1.6.4.  Media Operations.  Working proactively with the  media  increases trust and  two-way communication,  and  is  often  one  of  the  most  rapid  and  credible  means  of  delivering  the commander’s  message.    Remaining  open,  honest,  and  accessible  to  t he  maximum  extent possible  normally results  in  greater accuracy, context, and timeliness  in communicating with internal  and  external  audiences.    PAs  notify  and  coordinate  with  higher  headquarter  PA offices when  local  issues  generate  national or  international  media  interest.  Refer  to AFI 35-104, Media Operations, for  more  information. 1.6.5.  Community Engagement.  Community engagement  encompasses activities of  interest to the  general public, businesses, academia,  veterans,  service organizations,  military-related associations, and other community  entities.  Working collaboratively with and through these various  groups  enhances  mutual  understanding,  cooperation,  and  support  necessary  for effective Air Force operations and recruitment and retention opportunities.  See AFI 35-105, Community Relations, for  more  information. AFI35-101  12 JANUARY 2016   9  1.6.6.  Environmental.  PA supports environmental program objectives and  requirements by facilitating  public  notification  and  involvement  and  communicating  the  Air  Force’s commitment  to  environmental  excellence.    Refer  to  AFI  35-108,  Environmental  Public Affairs, for additional  information. 1.6.7.  Visual  Information  (VI).    Visual  products,  such  as  photo,  video,  and  graphics,  are catalysts  for effective communication and document the Air Force’ s  visual  history,  through the  accessioning  process,  for  future  generations.    Visual  products  communicate  strategic, operational, and tactical mission requirements, goals, and objectives.  See AFI 35-109, Visual Information, for  more  information. 1.6.8.  Band  Operations.    Air  Force  bands  provide  a  wide  spectrum  of  musical  support  for events that enhance  the  morale,  motivation, and esprit de corps of our  Airmen,  foster public trust  and  support,  aid  recruiting  initiatives,  and  promote  our  national  interests  at  home  and abroad.  See AFI 35-110, U.S. Air Force Band Program, for additional  information. 1.6.9.  Contingency  Operations  and  Wartime  Readiness.    Information  in  the  public  domain impacts  the  operational  environment  (JP  3-61,  Public  Affairs).    PA  forces  are  foremost  a deployable  combat  capability,  fully  trained  and  prepared  to  meet  the  needs  of  the  joint warfighter  inside  and  outside  the  wire.    The  mission  of  PA  is  to  plan,  coordinate,  and synchronize  U.S.  military  public  information  activities  and  resources  in  support  of  the commander’s intent and concept of operations.  PA enhances Airman morale and readiness to accomplish the  mission; gains and  maintains public trust and support  for  military operations; provides  trusted  counsel  to  leaders;  communicates  U.S.  resolve  in  a  manner  that  directly affects  the  operational  environment  through  global  influence  and  deterrence;  and  ensures visual documentation of joint and Air Force operations on the ground and in the air.  See AFI 35-111,  Public  Affairs  Contingency  Operations  and  Wartime  Readiness,  for  more information. 1.6.10.  Command Information.  PA provides effective and efficient communication tools to link  Airmen  with  their  leaders.    Command  information  helps  Airmen  and  their  families understand  their  purpose,  role,  and  value  to  the  Air  Force.    A  free  flow  of  information  to Airmen  and  their  families  creates  awareness  of  and  support  for  the  mission,  increases  their effectiveness  as  Air  Force  ambassadors,  reduces  the  spread  of  rumors  and  misinformation, and  provides  avenues  for  feedback.    See  AFI  35-113,  Internal  Information,  for  more information. 1.7.  Spokesperson  Requirements.  Formulation  and  promulgation  of  Air  Force  policy  is  an official  responsibility  and  may  be  performed  only  by  military  or  civilian  officia ls  of  the  Air Force.    In  accordance  with  Department  of  Defense  Directive  (DODD)  5122.05,  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs, PA  is the sole release authority to the  media  for official information  and serves  as the  principal  spokesperson  on behalf  of the  commander. 1.7.1.  Contract  PA and non-government  employees  are not authorized  to: 1.7.1.1.  Act  as official Air Force spokespersons,  including being  interviewed as subject matter  experts;  or 1.7.1.2.  Serve  as  approval  authorities  for  the  release  of  information  such  as  press releases, articles, imagery, or any content published to a publicly available website.  Only a government  employee  can be the  approval  authority  for  public  release  of information.   10  AFI35-101   12 JANUARY  2016 1.8.  Public Affairs Role in Commander’s Communication Synchronization (CCS).  CCS is a  planning  process  that  implements  higher- level  communication  guidance  by  facilitating coordination  and synchronization  of  themes,  messages,  images,  actions,  and operations. 1.8.1.  PA  enables  operational  planners  to  understand  potential  public  perceptions  of  Air Force operations and actions, and synchronizes  those operations  with supporting words and images.  Inconsistencies between what Airmen say and what they do damage the Air Force’s credibility  and negatively  affect  current  and future  missions. 1.8.2.  PA  helps  to  create,  strengthen,  or  preserve  conditions  favorable  to  accomplishing desired  objectives  by  providing  the  public  timely,  factual,  and  accurate  information,  while mitigating  unofficial  information,  misinformation,  and propaganda. 1.8.3.  PA  analyzes  and  assesses  communication  effects  and  progress  toward  mission accomplishment.    This  assists  commanders  with  decision  making  and  adjusting  their communication  strategy  when  necessary.    See  Joint  Doctrine  Note  2-13,  Commander’s Communication Synchronization, for  more  information. 1.9.  Coordination  Within  and  Outside  of  the  DOD.  PA  planning  may  require  intra-  and interagency coordination to ensure communication efforts are synchronized and consistent within Air  Force  and  DOD  channels,  as  well  as  with  other include nongovernmental  organizations  (NGOs). involved  agencies,  to 1.9.1.  Air  Force  units  assigned  as  component  forces  to  a  combatant  command  are  under operational control of the combatant commander.  These units  may receive operational  tasks and  guidance  from  the combatant command PA office  in coordination with the Office of the Assistant  to the  Secretary  of Defense  for  Public  Affairs  (OSD/PA). 1.9.2.  Overseas  PA  activities  are  carried  out  in  coordination  with  the  applicable  combatant command PA office and  the Department of State.  Typically, DOD PA representatives work with  the State Department PA office.   Local  DOD PA activities should support the strategic plans  developed  by the State Department  and combatant  commands. 1.9.3.  OSD/PA  can  provide  general  guidance.    When  appropriate,  PA  ensures  OSD/PA  is aware of  any  U.S. government  interagency  coordination. 1.10.  Legal  and  Ethical  Considerations.  PA  activities  must  be  conducted  within  the  bounds established by  law and  government ethics.  (T-0)  For  more  information on  legal considerations, such  as  Privacy  Act,  Freedom  of  Information  Act,  Section  508  compliance,  VI  life-cycle management,  and  environmental  PA  requirements,  refer  to  the  other  PA  35-series  AFIs.    For more  information on ethical considerations, such as  gifts, conflicts of  interest,  fundraising, and use  of  federal  government  resources,  refer  to  DOD  Publication  5500.07-R,  Joint  Ethics Regulation. 1.11.

All  Air Force  members and employees of the  Air Force, Air National  Guard, and  Air Force  Reserve  have  responsibility  for  the  success  of  the  Air  Force  PA  program.    As representatives of the AF  in official and  unofficial contact with the public, they contribute to public  opinions  of  the  service  and  should  strive  to  demonstrate  the  highest  standards  of conduct  and  reflect  the  Air  Force’s  core  values  of  integrity  first,  service  before  self,  and excellence  in  all  we do. 2.5.1.1.  Airmen  are  encouraged  to  use  social  media,  interpersonal  communication, community engagements, and other methods to share experiences with the public and tell the  Air  Force  story  while  maintaining  operational  security.    See  AFI  1-1,  Air  Force Standards,  for  more  information  on  social  media  considerations.    Airmen  must  obtain necessary  security  and  policy  review  before  releasing  official  imagery,  documents, information,  or  proposed  statements  outside  the  Air  Force.

Use their Air Force association, official  title, or position to promote, endorse, or benefit  any  profit- making  group  or  agency,  IAW  DOD  Publication  5500.07-R,  Joint Ethics Regulation, and AFI 1-1. (T-0)  This includes appearing in or preparing statements for  inclusion  in advertisements designed  for  use by electronic or print  media.   This does not  prohibit  Air  Force  members  from  assuming  character  or  modeling  roles  in commercial  advertisements  during  non-duty  hours.    Air  Force  members  are  prohibited from  wearing  uniforms  or  permitting  Air  Force      titles  or  positions  to  be  used  in advertisement  in  any  manner;  nor  may  members  permit  the  implication  of  Air  Force endorsement  of  products  or  services,  including  fundraising  for  any  charitable  purpose (limited  exceptions  include  the  Combined  Federal  Campaign,  the  Air  Force  Assistance Fund,  and  other  organizations  composed  primarily  of  DOD  employees  or  their  family members when fundraising among their own members for the benefit of welfare funds for their  own  members  or  family  members).

As  an  operating  principle,  unless  specifically  exempted  by  SAF/PA, installations  will  have  a  consolidated  PA  office  that  services  all  mission  areas  on  the installation  (i.e.,  one  base,  one  PA  office),  including  tenant  units.  (T-1)    A  single, consolidated  PA  office  synchronizes  communication  efforts  and  maximizes  PA  resources.  PA  offices  with  host  unit  responsibility  will  provide  support  and  guidance  to  tenant  and subordinate  organizations  according  to  host-tenant  support  agreements.  (T-2)    See  AFI  25-201,  Intra-Service,  Intra-Agency,  And  Inter-Agency  Support  Agreements  Procedures,  for more  information  on support  agreements. 3.1.1.1.  Reserve Component  tenant PA offices will  not consolidate  into active-duty  host wing  PA offices.  (T-1) 3.1.1.2.  Installations  in  close  proximity  to  one  another  may  be  supported  by  a consolidated  PA  office.    These  host-tenant  or  community  partnership  arrangements require  special  integration  efforts  to  ensure  proper  PA  support.    Tenant  units  or community partner  installations  should coordinate  with the  host  unit PA office  to ensure adequate  support  and prevent  duplication  or conflict. 3.1.1.3.  In instances where a second PA office exists on an installation (e.g., FOA, DRU, MAJCOM,  C-NAF,  etc.),  the host  unit  PA  is  the  lead  for  activities  of  overlapping  or mutual  interest,  including  those  with  local  or regional  media  or community  leaders. 3.1.1.4.  Airmen assigned to  the  host wing PA office  will  not be permanently reassigned (i.e. permanent change of assignment (PCA))  to another organization  on  the  installation without  concurrence  from  the  MAJCOM PA Director.  (T-1) 3.1.2.  Organization  Structure.    Standardized  structures  with  simple  and  straightforward designs  facilitate  communication  integration  and organization  effectiveness. 3.1.2.1.  Host wing PA offices.   Host  wing PA offices, except where  forward deployed, will  use  the  standard  organization  structure  depicted  in  Figure  3.1.    (T-1)    AF-led  joint installation and  host wing PA offices  that provide  full- time support to  large tenant  units (group level or above) will use the standard organization structure depicted in Figure 3.2. (T-1)    The  host  wing  PA  office  shall  be  prohibited  from  using  all  other  organization structures.  (T-1) 3.1.2.1.1.  Host  wing  PA  offices  at  Guard  bases  and  all  wing  PA  o ffices  at  Reserve units  will  organize  under  the  same  organizational  structure  as  active  duty  wing  PA offices,  IAW AFI 38-101.  (T-1) 3.1.2.1.2.  Although  not  considered  host  wings,  installation  PA  offices  at  Andersen, Hanscom,  and  Los  Angeles  Air  Force  Bases  will  also  use  the  standardized organization  structure.  (T-1)   22  AFI35-101   12 JANUARY  2016 3.1.2.1.3.  Distribution  of  manning  among  the  sections  is  determined  by  mission needs.    Rotational  assignment  of  personnel  among  sections  is  encouraged  and enhances  training  and  development. Figure  3.1.  Wing  PA Organization  Chart.  Figure  3.2.

See Chapter  5, Manpower  Management,  for more  information.   28  AFI35-101   12 JANUARY  2016 Chapter  4 RESOURCE  MANAGEMENT 4.1.  Overvie w.  Title 10, Subtitle D, of the United States Code prescribes the roles and missions of  the  Air  Force  as  well  as  its  organizing,  training,  and  equipping  responsibilities.    The responsibility  includes  the organizing,  training, and equipping of  the  service.   The President of the  United  States,  Congress,  Office  of  Management  and  Budget  (OMB),  Treasury  Department, and  DOD  must  take  certain  actions  before  the  Air  Force  can  legally  obligate  and  expend appropriated  funds. 4.1.1.  Planning,  Programming,  Budgeting,  and  Execution  (PPBE).    The  PPBE  is  DOD’s annual  strategic  planning,  program  development,  resource  determination,  and  budgeting process  used  to  define  the  plans  and  programs  that  satisfy  the  demands  of  the  National Security  Strategy  within  resource  constraints. 4.1.1.1.  Planning.   Air Force planners  identify  long-range  requirements and assess  them against the current force and resourcing. This ensures requirements are aligned with DOD strategic  guidance.  Planners predict  what capabilities  the  Air Force  needs  from  the  next budget  year to decades into  the  future. 4.1.1.2.  Programming.    The  Air  Force  Corporate  Structure  balances  service  needs  with projected resources.  Requirements, including forces, manpower, and funding for the next five years, are refined and prioritized.  The final approved plan is delivered to OSD as the Air  Force Program  Objective  Memorandum  (POM). 4.1.1.3.  Budgeting.   The  Air Force submits a separate detailed budget estimate to DOD concurrently  with  the POM.   The OMB consolidates  DOD’s budget with those of other federal agencies  and delivers  them to Congress as part of  the President’s  Budget request for the next  fiscal  year (FY).  Congress appropriates  funding and  may  modify the budget  based on information  obtained  from  hearings  and additional  details. 4.1.1.4.  Execution.    At  the  beginning  of  each  FY,  if  the  budget  has  been  passed,  the funding  is released to the MAJCOMs, and Air Force  units are then responsible  for  using the  funding  as approved by Congress. 4.1.2.  At  any  given  time,  multiple  budgets  are  in  the  planning  or  execution  phases.  These include  funds still being executed  from previous FY obligations; the current FY (execution year);  the  upcoming  FY  (budget  year);  and  FY  severa l  years  into  the  future  (Future  Years Defense  Program). 4.1.3.  AFI  65-601,  Budget  Guidance  and  Procedures,  contains  information  on  types, purposes,  time  limitations,  and amount  limitations  of  appropriations. 4.2.  Purpose.  PA requires  funding,  manpower,  training, supplies, and equipment  to effectively support  the  Air  Force  mission.    Resource  management  is  the  process  of  determining requirements  and  obtaining  and  allocating  resources  to  meet  the  direct  mission  and  support duties. 4.3.  Budget.  PA at all levels must play an active role in managing and advocating with the unit resource  advisor  (RA),  if  applicable,  for  funding  of  PA  activities  in  execution  and  budgeting AFI35-101  12 JANUARY 2016   29  planning years. (T-1)  Responsibilities include monitoring execution year expenditures, planning for  known  requirements  in  the  next  FY,  and  projecting  requirements  for  the  future  years  (see Attachment  4  for  sample  execution  plan  development  cycle  and  Attachment  5  for  a  sample budget).    Working  closely  with  the  unit  resource  advisor  throughout  t he  year  ensures  PA understands  the  resource  request  and  allocation  process,  and  helps  the  resource  advisor understand  PA’s resource  requirements. 4.3.1.  Planning.    Planning  the  next  FY’s  budget  includes  reviewing  past  expenditures (equipment,  training,  travel,  subscriptions,  supplies,  etc.)  and  forecasting  future  expenses.  Research  expected  changes  in  PA  programs,  identify  cost  of  those  changes,  annotate  them, and  justify projections.   Include  any  new activities and annual cost  increases.  Plan  for both peacetime  and  wartime  requirements,  with  wartime  requirements  the  highest  priority.    The local  logistics  plans  office  can  identify  forward-area  wartime  taskings  and  associated equipment  requirements  that  are  to  be  included.    Wing  PA  execution  plans  are  typically forwarded to  the  unit  RA or comptroller  for  consolidation and approval at the  wing prior to being  submitted  to  the  MAJCOM.    MAJCOM  PA  offices  may  ask  wing  PA  offices  to forecast  equipment  needs,  which  MAJCOMs may  be able  to help  purchase. 4.3.2.  Execution.  Funding allocation  is compared against the execution plan to  identify any unfunded  requirements.  Any  identified shortfalls should be submitted to the  unit RA during initial funds distribution (October-December) and budget reviews.  By July 30, offices should have spent at  least 80 percent of the budget.   By  law,  no  more than 20 percent of the budget may be spent in the final two months of the FY.  PA resource managers must provide input to the wing comptroller for periodic budget reviews and any calls for end-of- year requirements. (T-1)  End-of- year requirement calls  inform  the wing commander’s priority execution  list,  if funding  becomes  available,  and  are  an  excellent  opportunity  for  PA  offices  to  refresh supplies  and  equipment. 4.3.3.  Operations and  Maintenance (O&M) Funds.   The  majority of PA activities are O&M funded and  the PA resource  manager should work with the  unit RA to become  familiar with PA-specific  program  elements,  responsibility  center/cost  center  codes,  and  budget  program activity  codes (BPAC).   Resourcing  related 4.3.4.  Environmental  Funds. is distributed  through  the  civil  engineer  and  supports  strategic  and  tactical  planning  of environmental  issues  and  community  involvement.    PA  should  be  part  of  the  o ngoing environmental planning process and responsible  for community  involvement  in coordination with  the  civil  engineer. to  environmental  management 4.3.5.  Budget Training.  The PA chief will have the responsibility to manage and control the resources  allocated  to  the  PA  office  by  the  unit  commander.  (T-1)    Required  skills  include effectively  identifying and justifying  requirements, obtaining  timely obligation records  from the  unit  RA,  analyzing  expenditures,  and  projecting  excess  or  shortages.    The  wing comptroller  can provide  resource  management  training.   30  AFI35-101   12 JANUARY  2016 Chapter  5 MANPOWER  MANAGEMENT 5.1.  Overvie w.  Manpower  and  personnel  are  related,  but  the  terms  are  not  interchangeable.  Joint  Publication  1-02  defines  manpower  requirements  as  the  human  resources  needed  to accomplish a specified job, workload, mission, or program, and personnel are the people who fill those  positions.    Manpower  influences  the  amount  and  type  of  people  assigned  to  an  office  to accomplish  its  mission;  therefore,  understanding  and  monitoring  manpower  is  a  primary management  responsibility  and  should  be  done  IAW  AFI  38-201,  Management  of  Manpower Requirements and Authorizations. largely  determined  by 5.2.  Positions.  An  office’s  positions  are independent  processes.  Periodically,  manpower  offices  conduct  studies  to  determine  the  number  and  grade  of  people required  to  perform  the  mission.    The  study  results  are  published  in  a  manpower  standard.  Separately,  Congress  determines  annually  the  maximum  number  of  officer  and  enlisted authorizations  for each  military service.   Requirements and authorizations do not always  match, resulting in some requirements that remain unfunded.  Funded positions are called authorizations and  are  the  positions  that  Air  Force  Personnel  Center  assignment  teams  attempt  to  fill.    For civilian positions,  the budget and civilian  work  years determine which authorizations are  funded and filled,  and a position’s  core document  determines  its  occupational  series  and grade. 5.3.  Military  Grades.  Air  Force  headquarters  allocates  grades  via  a  programming  model  to determine a  fair share  grades distribution.  Career  field  managers review their respective career field’s  “required  grade” positions prior to grades allocation and throughout the  grades allocation process.    MAJCOMs  distribute  grades  to  their  units,  and  the  units,  in  turn,  distribute  them accordingly  to  their  offices.    A  shortage  of  available  grades  sometimes  occurs,  so  the  required grade  is  not  always  the  authorized  grade.    Assignment  teams  attempt  to  fill  positions  at  the authorized  grade, not  the required  grade. 5.4.  Unit  Manpowe r  Document  (UMD).  The  UMD,  a  computer- generated  report  from  the Manpower Programming and Execution System (MPES), lists the unit’s positions, as well as the characteristics  associated  with  each  position  such  as  grade  and  AFSC.    Installation  manpower points  of  contact  provide  UMDs  to  units  periodically  and  can  adjust  the  information  in  and format of  the  reports, as well as arrange automated delivery to  suit a PA office’s  needs.   UMD key terms  include: 5.4.1.  Air  Force  Specialty  Code  (AFSC).    Represents  a  specific  military  occupational specialty,  skill,  or  qualification.    Civilian  positions  list  the  occupational  series  and  the corresponding  military  AFSC  on  the  UMD.    Refer  to  the  Air  Force  Enlisted  Classification Directory  and  Air  Force  Officer  Classification  Directory  available  through  myPers  for further  information to  include  specialty summaries, duties and responsibilities, and  specialty qualifications.   See Table  5.1 for a list  of Public  Affairs  and Band  AFSCs. Table 5.1.  Public  Affairs  and  Band AFSCs.

Authorized Grade (GRD).  The grade personnel systems use to assign personnel.  The GRD may be different from the required grade described in Paragraph 5.4.8.  Civilian grades are determined by  the  grade classification assigned  to a position’s core personnel document, and  it  is  this  grade  that  is  reflected on the  UMD.  If the position description changes and  is classified at a different grade, the grade on the UMD changes accordingly.  If a civilian grade has not  yet been  determined,  it appears as to be determined  (TBD). 5.4.3.  Effective  and  Through  Dates.    These  indicate  when  a  change  takes  effect.    The standard  through  date  is  31  Dec  4712.    Positions  with  pending  changes  are  listed  twice—once  denoting  the  position’s  current  elements  and  once  denoting  elements  after  the  change takes effect. 5.4.4.  Functional  Account  Codes  (FAC).    This  six-digit  alphanumeric  code  identifies  each function and  facilitates the analysis and accounting of  manpower requirements.  It  identifies the  functions or activities performed by the position.  Only PA  manpower or PA offices will be associated  with PA FACs.  (T-1)  Contact the  installation  manpower office or MAJCOM PA for  current  PA FACs and guidance  on their  use. 5.4.5.  Personnel  Accounting  Symbol  (PAS).    A  unique  eight-digit  alphanumeric  code  that identifies  a specific  unit,  owning  command  and servicing  military  personnel  office. 5.4.6.  Position  Number  (POS).    The  ten-digit  number  (also  called  the  Manpower  Position Control Number (MPCN)  in personnel data  systems) that  identifies a particular position.  A two-digit  MAJCOM  code  is  included  at  the  end  of  each  position  number;  therefore,  all position  numbers  from  the same  unit  ends  with  the  same alphanumeric  code. 5.4.7.  Program  Element  Code  (PEC).    Represents  the  budget  source  for  the  position.    The PECs  for  most PA positions are either 91214 or aligned  under a command support program element (XX534F);  however, other PECs  may be  used.  Contact the  MAJCOM PA office  if there  are any  questions. 5.4.8.  Required Grade (RGR).  The  grade  for a particular position as earned by a  manpower standard.    Differences  between  the  required  grade  and  the  authorized  grade  may  be  due  to funding  constraints,  career progression  grades,  or grade  ceiling  limitations. 5.4.9.  Security Access  Requirement  (SAR).  Identifies the security clearance  level required for  the  position.    Refer  to  AFI  31-501,  Personnel  Security  Program  Management,  for  a complete  list  of  SAR codes. 5.5.  Office  Symbol  Code  (OSC).  This  code  indicates  command  structure  of  the  unit.    The fewer  characters  there  are  in  an  OSC,  the  higher  the  echelon  placement  in  the  unit  (e.g., SAF/PAR is subordinate to SAF/PA).  Table 5.2 provides a list of approved PA OSCs.  The only   32  AFI35-101   12 JANUARY  2016 approved  office  symbol  for  PA  offices  below  MAJCOM  level  is  the  two- letter  PA.    With  the exception of the Air Force Academy and Air Force Public Affairs Agency, only MAJCOM- level and  higher PA offices are authorized  to add a third  letter, such as PAO, PAR, PAX, or PAY, to denote a specific sub-section.   BA  is  the traditional OSC for Air Force  Bands (e.g., band  units) while  PAB  is  used  to  denote  a  Bands  division  on  a  headquarters  staff  (e.g.,  SAF/PAB  is  the Bands  division  subordinate  to  SAF/PA).    MAJCOM- level  and  higher  PA  offices  may  use command-unique  OSCs IAW AFI 38-101. Table 5.2.  Public  Affairs  OSCs.

Authorization  Change  Request  (ACR).  An  Authorization  Change  Request  (ACR)  is  a tool  used  to  propose  adjustments  to  a  UMD.    It  is  used  to  request  an  addition,  change, realignment,  or  deletion  of  an  authorization  on  the  UMD.    PA  offices  requesting  changes  to manpower  authorizations,  such  as  AFSC,  civilian  occupational  series,  or  grade  or  skill  level adjustments, must coordinate with the local manpower and higher headquarters PA offices. (T-2)  Format  of  an  ACR  varies  by  base.    The  installation  manpower  point(s)  of  contact  can  provide examples. 5.6.1.  Wing PA  will  coordinate  manpower changes with the  installation  manpower point(s) of contact  and MAJCOM PA. (T-2) 5.6.2.  MAJCOM/FOA/DRU PA will coordinate  manpower changes  with the MAJCOM A1 and SAF/PAR.  (T-2) 5.7.  Types  of  Manpower.  The  Air  Force  uses  three  types  of  manpower  to  perform  required work:  military  (i.e.,  active  duty,  Air  Force  Reserve,  and  National  Guard);  civilian;  and contractors. 5.7.1.  Military Manpower.   In  accordance with  DOD  guidance, the  services assign  milit ary personnel  only  to positions  that: 5.7.1.1.  Directly  contribute  to  the  prosecution  of  war  (combat,  combat  support,  or combat  service  support). 5.7.1.2.  Are military  by law. 5.7.1.3.  Are military  by custom  or tradition. 5.7.1.4.  Are  needed  for overseas rotation, operational deployment augmentation, and/or career field  sustainment. 5.7.2.  Civilian Manpower.  Civilian employees are hired to perform work in an occupational series at a specific level of expertise and responsibility.  Civilian personnel is responsible for AFI35-101  12 JANUARY 2016   33  the accurate classification of positions,  including  the establishment of title, series, and  grade. PA  should  contact  the  PA  career  field  team  (PACFT)  at  the  Air  Force  Personnel  Center (AFPC)  for  information and  guidance regarding  hiring actions, developmental opportunities, and other  civilian  personnel  actions. 5.7.2.1.  Standard Core Personnel Document (SCPD).  SCPDs are a combination of what were once known as position descriptions and performance  management plans.   The  use of SCPDs is mandatory for civilian positions unless a waiver is obtained from the PACFT chief. 5.7.2.1.1.  To request a waiver, managers must submit a request through their chain of command  to  the  PACFT  for  approval.  (T-1)    The  waiver  request  includes:  career field, SCPD  number, classification/title, servicing classifier, and justification  for  not using  an SCPD. 5.7.2.1.2.  Most  PA  SCPDs  do  not  include  specific  duty  titles,  giving  PA  greater flexibility  to  realign  qualified  civilians  while  maintaining  the  same  SCPD.    The SCPD  Library (https://gum-crm.csd.disa.mil/app/ans wers/detail/a_id/21187 ). the  myPers  website is located on 5.7.2.2.  Core Personnel Document (CPD).  If an SCPD  waiver  has been granted, a CPD is  used.  CPDs  are  identical  to  SCPDs  except  they  are  used  for  one  position  only.  Therefore,  managers  have  less  flexibility  on  project  assignments,  and  periodic  career field  requirements  and updates  are not  automatic. 5.7.2.3.  Connection  to  AFSC.    Assigned  duties  generally  conform  to  a  corresponding AFSC  on  manpower  documents.    Civilian  occupational  series  and  AFSCs  are  assigned based on position duties and responsibilities.  PA offices  should avoid using OCC series from  other  career  fields,  such  as  the  0300  group  (general  administrative,  clerical,  and office  services),  if the position  has a PA AFSC and performs PA duties.   If a position  is earned through a PA manpower standard, the position must use one of the PA OCC series listed  in  Table  5.3. (T-1) Table 5.3.  Civilian  OCC  Series Relation to PA AFSCs.

For GS-09 and below For GS-11 and above 5.7.2.4.  Centrally  Managed  Positions.    The  Air  Force  deliberately  develops  employees for positions of  increased responsibility through central  management, IAW  AFMAN 36-606, Civilian Career Field Management and Development.  Generally, centrally managed positions  are  eligible  to  receive  centrally  funded  moves  (i.e.,  permanent  change  of station)  and  other  developmental  opportunities  to  include  short-term  management  and leadership  training,  Civilian  Developmental  Education  (CDE),  and  tuition  assistance, when  available.    In  addition  to  the  civilian  positions  described  in  the  Public  Affairs chapter  of  AFMAN  36-606,  the  Air  Force,  through  the  PACFT  at  AFPC,  centrally manages: 5.7.2.4.1.  Career  Broadening  (CB)  positions.  The  CB  program  provides  structured developmental  opportunities  that  broaden  and  enhance  the  leadership  skills  of  high-potential  employees.  CB  assignments  require  geographic  mobility  agreements  and typically  range  from  24 to 30 months. 5.7.2.4.2.  PALACE  Acquire  (PAQ)  training  positions.    The  PA  PAQ  program  is  a vital element  civilian workforce renewal.  PAQ trainees are hired at the GS-07 level.  If  the  employee  meets  training  requirements,  he/she  is  promoted  to  the  GS-09  level after  one  year,  where  he/she  stays  until  outplacement  (generally  after  no  more  than two years  as a GS-09) to a permanent  GS-11 level  position. 5.7.3.  Contracted Services.  At some locations, the office manpower mix includes contracted services  which  are  referred  to  as  contract  full  time  equivalents  (CFTEs).    These  earned manpower authorizations  have been outsourced to accomplish specified workload associated with  a  manpower  standard.    CFTE  positions,  tracked  through  the  Enterprise-wide Contracting  Manpower  Reporting  Application,  are  expressions  of  in- house  manpower requirements  at the  same  level  of service  specified  in  the contract. AFI35-101  12 JANUARY 2016   35  Chapter  6 COMMUNICATION  PLANNING 6.1.  Purpose.  Communication  planning  is  important  to  the  creation  of  strategic,  operational, and  tactical  effects  in  PA  operations.    This  chapter  explains  how  PA  uses  the  complete communication  planning  process,  including  the  four  phases  of  research,  plan,  execute,  and assess. 6.1.1.  Air Force communication planning is designed to maintain the narrowest possible gap between what  the  Air Force  says and what  it does.   This ensures policies and programs are designed well  and are effectively  implemented and executed.  PA  must take  the  initiative to plan  and execute  for communication  effects.  (T-1) 6.1.2.  Level of  effort.    This  involves ensuring the right  level of effort  is applied to  achieve the desired end state.  Some  issues can be  effectively planned  using a schedule of events, a single-event  plan,  PAG,  or  talking  points  with  questions  and  answers.    Other  issues  may require  more  in-depth  communication planning.   The  format of a communication document is  not as important  as its  content. 6.1.3.  Relationships.  PA  must build and  maintain  relationships  with decision- makers  to be involved in issues from the beginning stages as opinions are formed, decisions are made, and details  are  developed.  (T-1)    PA  gains  support  from  the  chain  of  command  and  ensures information involved  organizations  by  keeping  all stakeholders in  the  communication  planning  process.    Solid  relationships, cooperation,  and integration  help  ensure  successful  execution  of  communication  plans. is  updated  and involved integrated  with 6.1.4.  Team effort.  Communication planning is most successful when it is a team effort that actively  seeks  input  and  feedback  from  functional  areas  with  a  stake  in  the  organization’s communication. 6.2.  Types  of  Communication  Plans.  Communication  plans  may  be  developed  for  a  wide range  of issues  where  integration  and synchronization  of communication  activities  is required. 6.2.1.  Deliberate  communication  plans  are  typically  developed  to  support  long-term, enterprise  level, enduring efforts  that cross  functions and  involve  multiple stakeholders and communicators  over  a  significant  time  period.    Examples  include  plans  for  the  nuclear enterprise,  diversity,  and major  acquisitions. 6.2.2.  Campaign communication plans support discrete objectives (typically in support of, or aligned  with, broader priorities) and are often associated  with well-defined,  limited duration periods or specific activities or events.  Examples include plans for the Air Force birthday, an air  show  or open house,  or change/addition  to a wing’s  mission. 6.2.3.  Contingency communication plans address fairly narrow or specific issues and may be developed  in  advance  of,  or  in  conjunction  with,  crisis  events  or  emerging  opportunities.  Examples include aircraft mishaps, nuclear-related incidents, on-base disturbances, and high-profile  courts-martial.   36  AFI35-101   12 JANUARY  2016 6.2.4.  While the basic  format and design process  for all communication p lans  is similar, the level  of  detail  and  background  analysis  may  vary  across  planning  efforts  and  should  be tailored  to fit  the organization  and circumstances. 6.3.  Research.  The first phase of effective communication is research. The goal of this phase  is a comprehensive  list of  variables and  findings  that  informs and  impacts communication efforts. A strategic  and analytic  mindset  is  essential  in  this  phase. 6.3.1.  Intent.    The  first  step  of  research  is  to  identify  the  strategic  intent  of  the  supported program or initiative and the intended effect of the communication effort.  PA communicates to  achieve  a  desired  effect  and  seeks  to  identify  potential  intended  and  unintended consequences.    In  some  cases,  the  overall  goal  or  desired  effect  is  to  create  awareness  that can be translated  into support  for  the  Air Force.  In other situations, the desired effect  is to encourage  a  specific  action.    Based  on  commander  priorities  and  guidance,  PA  develops  a statement  of  intent  to  describe  what  goal  or  end  state  a  communication  activity  seeks  to achieve. 6.3.2.  There  are two types  of research:  primary  and  secondary. 6.3.2.1.  Primary research  involves  gathering  new  information  firsthand  for a specifically identified purpose.  There are two broad categories of primar y  research: quantitative and qualitative. 6.3.2.1.1.  Quantitative  measures,  such  as  scientific  surveys,  produce  data  that  are usually  applicable  to  some  larger  population.    Quantitative  research  relies  on numerical  assessment  of  hard  data  and  requires  specialized  skills  to  perform  and analyze correctly.  The Air Force Survey Office  is the point of contact  for all attitude and  opinion  surveys,  polls,  questionnaires,  and  telephone  interviews  to  Air  Force members,  according  to  AFI  38-501,  Air  Force  Survey  Program.    A  list  of  surveys currently approved by the  Air Force Survey Office  is on the AF Portal.  Review AFI 38-501  and  coordinate  with  the  Air  Force  Survey  Office  (af.surveys@us.af.mil) before conducting surveys.  SAF/PA also sponsors periodic Air Force surveys, which may  be  helpful  in  communication  planning.    SAF/PA  survey  and  communication products are posted on the AF Portal.  Search for “Telling the Air Force Story” under “News  & Announcements.” 6.3.2.1.2.  Qualitative  measures, such as personal  interviews,  focus  groups, and  field observations,  yield  less  statistical  data  but  can  provide  a  deeper  understanding  of  a topic.    Information  gathered  from  qualitative  research  can  help  explain  what stakeholders think.  PA can conduct qualitative research by talking with commanders, first  sergeants,  equal  opportunity  officials,  the  inspector  general,  and  other  Airmen.  Qualitative  research  of  community  members  can  be  conducted  using  a  content analysis of media coverage and discussions with a diverse group of key civic leaders.  Qualitative  measures  also  can  be  applied  to  the  survey  development  process  to improve  the  quantitative  measures  described  above. 6.3.2.2.  Secondary  research  uses  outside  information  previously  as sembled  by  other organizations such  as  government agencies,  industry and  trade associations, educational institutions,  and  media  sources.    Typically  it  is  cheaper  and  faster  to  use  secondary research.    For  example,  the  local  chamber  of  commerce  may  already  have  completed AFI35-101  12 JANUARY 2016   37  demographic,  economic,  or  attitude  surveys  that  may  be  helpful  in  communication planning.   Online  databases also  maintain  a large  amount  of research  information. 6.3.3.  When developing a  general communication plan, the research phase should  focus on the  commander’s  intent  and  unit  mission  accomplishment,  then  on  key  publics  and/or stakeholders,  key themes  and  messages,  spokespersons,  and desired  effects. 6.3.4.  Next, determine communication challenges, scoping  the communication environment. This  is  called  environmental  scanning.    Identifying  hot  issues,  alternative  viewpoints,  and positive  communication  opportunities  helps  define  the  plan’s  focus  over  a  period  of  time.  Consider  the  strengths,  weaknesses,  opportunities,  and  threats  that  ens ure  or  inhibit  the success of  the effort.   Environmental scanning  is an on-going process,  requiring some effort every  day to stay  up to date. 6.3.5.  A  measure  of  success  for  a  communication  plan  is  whether  the  key  publics  and/or stakeholders’ knowledge, attitudes, or behaviors  have changed over  time.  Therefore, during the research phase,  it  is  important  to  learn what potential stakeholders currently know,  what they  believe,  and  how  they  behave.    Types  of  audiences  are  described  in  more  detail  in Paragraph  6.4. 6.3.6.  An  important  role  of  PA  is  to  provide  the  commander  periodic  assessments  of  what people are thinking about the organization and  the Air Force.   This  is PA’s responsibility as the  commander’s  trusted  counsel. 6.4.  Plan.  In  the  planning  phase,  the  goal  is  to  identify  a  way  ahead  to  provide  information, knowledge, and awareness to stakeholders and key publics to close the gap between their current and desired knowledge  level, attitude, and behavior with  relation to a  given subject.  At the end of this phase, the communication plan includes an engagement strategy that bridges the gap from a  strategic  focus  to  a  tactical  product.    Planning  is  not  new  to  PA.    PA  professionals  study planning  and  comprehend  its  importance  to  successful  activities,  but  often  fail  to  commit  the plan  in  writing.   The  following  steps contribute  to effective  planning. 6.4.1.  Determine  the  purpose  and  goals  of  the  communication  plan.    Goals  are  general, summative  statements  that  spell  out  the  overall  outcomes  based  on  a  co mmand  initiative.  Goals  establish  what  will  be  accomplished if  the  objectives  are  achieved.    The communication  plan  purpose  or  intent  describes  why  the  communication  plan  is  being developed  and, broadly,  the goals  the  communication  activities  are designed  to achieve. 6.4.2.  Define  specific  audiences,  publics,  and/or  stakeholders.    A  list  of  specific  key audiences, publics, and stakeholders  evolves by answering the questions,  “Who  needs  to be informed?”,  “Who  has  the  power  to  influence  this  issue?”,  and  “W ho  is  a  process  owner?”  Definitions for audience, public, and stakeholder from Joint Doctrine Note 2-13 are provided for  clarity: 6.4.2.1.  Audience.    A  broad,  roughly-defined  group  that  gives  a  general  concept  of  a population.      An  audience  is  not  a  group  on  which  to  formulate  a  communication approach.    Defining  audiences  is  simply  the  beginning  of  the  planning  process  for determining  stakeholders  and  recognizing  publics.    Examples  include  internal  and external  audiences,  American  domestic  audience,  international  audience,  and adversaries.   38  AFI35-101   12 JANUARY  2016 6.4.2.2.  Public.   A clearly defined  group of people that  the  Air Force  has an  interest  in listening  to  and  communicating  with.    Publics  can  be  segmented  from  the  population  a variety  of  ways, include  geography,  demographics,  psychographics,  position, membership,  role  in  decision  making,  etc.    The  more  defined  the  public,  the  better  PA can  tailor  the  communication  strategy  and  products.    Examples  include  first  sergeants, squadron  commanders,  Air  Force  spouses,  base  res idents,  local  retirees,  civilian employees,  local  media,  and local  business  owners. to 6.4.2.3.  Stakeholder.    Individuals  or  groups  that  are  directly  impacted  by,  and  have  an interest  in,  Air  Force  operations,  actions,  or  outcomes.    Stakeholders  are  naturally motivated  toward  action  if  their  interests  are  involved,  and  they  can  affect  mission execution.    Depending  on  the  situation,  stakeholders  may  be  the  same  as  publics.  Examples  include  employees,  civic  leaders  (e.g.  government  officials,  business  leaders,  community  leaders),  newspaper  editors,  TV  station  managers,  journalists,  bloggers,  Air Force supporters  (e.g.  retirees,  defense/aerospace  industry,  associations),  and Congress. 6.4.3.  Identify  desired  effects  of  communication  efforts  for  each  public  and/or  stakeholder.  Desired  effects  are  described  in  broad  terms  and  usually  refer  to  the  knowledge,  attitude, and/or  behavior  changes  PA  activities  intend  to  achieve.    For  example,  if  attempting  to reduce  the  number  of  people  who  drive  after  consuming  alcoho l,  a  desired  effect  could  be, “Increase  use  of designated  drivers  among  base personnel  who  drink  alcoholic  beverages.” 6.4.4.  Define  objectives.    Objectives  articulate  what  knowledge,  attitude,  and/or  behavior outcomes  are  desired  from  a  specific  public;  how  much  change;  and  by  what  deadline. Objectives  support  the  overall  mission  but  do  not  describe  the  means  to  achieving  the  end state. 6.4.4.1.  Well-written  objectives  are  specific,  measurable,  attainable,  relevant,  and  time-bound (SMART).  An example of an objective  is,  “Within  six  months, decrease by 30% the  number  of  DUIs received  by base personnel.” 6.4.4.2.  If  the  objectives  and  tactics  do  not  achieve  the  desired  effects,  adjust  the communication plan, identifying new objectives and/or tactics until the desired effects are achieved.    Objectives  help  shape  assessment  tools  later  in  the  communication  planning process. 6.4.5.  Identify  spokespersons.    To  whom  does  the  public  listen?    Who  has  the  right knowledge, authority, and delivery style to effectively carry the  message?  Answers  to these questions  can  provide  PA  with  potential  spokespersons.    There  can  be  more  than  one effective  spokesperson  per  message,  based  on  the  public.    For  example,  the  Air  Force  may choose  to send a senior  leader  to testify  to Congress  to discuss an Air Force program, while first  sergeants  deliver  the message  to Airmen. 6.4.6.  Define  themes  and  messages.    The  next  step  is  to  develop  themes  and  messages.  Identify  the  logical,  convincing,  truthful  arguments  or  messages  to  increase  the  publics’ knowledge or  further their  understanding  so that  they want to take action toward the desired end state.  Write  themes and  messages  in clear and concise English.   Avoid technical  jargon or complicated  wording. 6.4.6.1.  A theme  is a  unifying and enduring  idea or  intention  that  supports the  narrative and  is  designed  to  provide  guidance  and  continuity  for  messaging  and  related  products.  AFI35-101  12 JANUARY 2016   39  The  theme  generally  is  memorable  and  is shorter and  less detailed  than a  message.   An example  of  a theme  is, “Diversity  is  a military  necessity.” 6.4.6.2.  Messages  support  themes  and  communication  objectives  by  delivering  tailored information to a specific public.  Messages can also be  tailored  for delivery at a specific time, place,  and communication  method.   An example of a  message  is,  “Diversity  is the key to creative solutions for complex problems and provides our Air Force a competitive edge in  air,  space, and cyberspace.” 6.4.7.  Establish  engagement  strategies.    A  strategy  represents  the  game  plan  and  describes how  to  achieve  the  communication  objectives.    For  example,  a  strategy  designed  to  reach local  civic  leaders  can  be  expressed  in  general  terms  such  as,  “Employ  a  community engagement  campaign,”  or  the  strategy  can  be  more  specific  such  as,  “Expose  local  civic leaders  to messages  about  the new  mission  requirements  at installation  X.” 6.4.8.  Develop tactics.  Tactics are specific actions taken in support of a strategy.  Tactics are flexible  and  can  be  adjusted  as  opportunities  arise.    Each  input  should  have  specific information  to  answer  the  following  questions:  who  is  the  public,  how  do  they  get  their information/how  can  they  be  reached,  who  will  they  listen  to,  and  when  is  the  best  time  to approach  them  with  this  message.    Tactics  should  pair  spokesperson/channel/message  in order to achieve a specific desired effect.  This pairing exercise  gets the right  voice with the right  message  through  the  right  channel  or  venue  at  the  right  time.    For  example,  “15 January,  wing  commander—speech  to  the  Military  Affairs  Committee  to  discuss  the  new mission  requirements  at installation  X.” 6.4.8.1.  To  determine  the  best  channel  for  delivery  of  messages  and  information, consider  where  or  from  whom  publics  currently  get  their  information.    How  can commanders  best  reach  stakeholders  and  provide  information  to  increase  knowledge and/or  influence  attitudes  and behaviors? 6.4.8.1.1.  Some  common  command  (internal)  communication  channels  include commander’s briefings, installation/unit  websites,  email,  Air  Force  Portal,  AF  Link,  local  media,  and  social media. installation/unit calls, leadership speeches and 6.4.8.1.2.  Some  common  external  channels  include  installation/unit  websites,  AF Link, social media, newspaper/TV/radio/Internet (e.g., interviews, media roundtables, press  releases,  press  conferences),  individual  meetings/conversations  (e.g.,  Military Affairs  Committee  meetings,  meetings  with  the local  mayor),  and  public  appearances. 6.4.8.1.3.  After  Action  Input.    Gathering  information  for  an  after-action  report  may be  difficult  after  the  plan  is  executed,  especially  when  multiple  staffs  are  involved.  Therefore,  after  action  input  should  be  a  consideration  during  initial  planning.    One approach  is  to  provide  POCs  with  a  template  they  can  use  to  capture  thoughts, recommendations,  and lessons  learned  as the plan  is executed  and/or  events  occur. 6.5.  Execute.  The  execution  or  implementation  phase  of  communication  planning  involves completing  the  tasks  in  the plan.   The communication plan  is a dynamic document.   Individual elements,  such  as  publics,  tactics,  or  messages,  may  be  updated  as  needed.    Communication documents  should  be  distributed  to  all  supporting  PA  units  and  used  to  prepare  senior  leaders and spokespersons  to ensure  unity  of message.   40  AFI35-101   12 JANUARY  2016 6.6.  Assess.  Proper  assessment  considers impact  of communication efforts, and requires  monitoring,  measuring, and analyzing relevant  information to evaluate  the success  of  PA activities. the  preparation,  execution,  and 6.6.1.  Evaluating the preparation of  the plan consists of assessing the quality and adequacy of the  information  used  to develop  the  audience  matrix,  messages,  strategy,  and tactics. 6.6.2.  During execution,  monitoring progress of communication efforts assists commanders with  decision  making  and adjusting  operations,  if  necessary,  to achieve  the desired  end  state. 6.6.3.  Analyzing  the  impact  of  communication  efforts  provides  insights  on  how  the communication  plan  was executed  and on whether  or not desired  effects  were achieved. 6.6.4.  Assessment  methods  and  tools  are  similar  to  those  used  during  initial  research  and help to provide before and after  measurements.   Assessment results can also serve as  new a baseline and feed into environmental scanning for the next round of planning.  Commanders, process owners, planners, and communicators all benefit from timely and relevant evaluation, measurement,  and  assessment.   Sharing  communication  research  data  with  other organizations  is  an  important  part  of  maintaining  strong  working  relationships  and  closing the  loop on the  research-plan-execute-assess  planning  process. 6.7.  Advantages.  A carefully developed communication plan can  help PA contribute to overall unit  mission  accomplishment. 6.7.1.  Integration.    A  fully  integrated  communication  plan  can  help  a  functional  program achieve  specific  goals. 6.7.2.  Support.    A  fully  supported  communication  plan  adds  credibility  and  authority  to communication  efforts. 6.7.3.  Posture. developments  and contributes  to an overall  positive,  proactive  command.   A  correctly  postured  communication  plan  anticipates  conceivable 6.7.4.  Timing.   A well- timed communication plan can  help commanders and senior  leaders efficiently  and effectively  deliver  multiple  messages. 6.8.  Plan  Format.  Attachment  6  provides  a  sample  detailed  planning  worksheet  and communication plan executive summary.  Not every plan has all the elements in the example, but communication  plans  feature  most  of   Air  Force  Public  Affairs  Awards  for Communication  Excellence  program  award  nominations  address  all  four  major  planning elements (research, plan, execute, and assess).  Recent award-winning submissions posted on the PA  SharePoint  site  in  the  “Resources-Awards”  area  provide  excellent  benchmarking  ideas  for each phase  of a plan. them.  KATHLEEN  A.

This structure increases management effectiveness and improves cross- functional decision- making by providing a  forum  in which senior  leaders can apply  their collective judgment and experience to major programs, objectives, and  issues.   This process  balances programs among  mission  areas, between  force  structure  and support,  and between  readiness  and modernization. Audience—A  broad,  roughly-defined  group  that  gives  a  general  concept  of  a  population.      An audience is not a group on which to formulate a communication approach.  Defining audiences is simply  the  beginning  of  the  planning  process  for  determining  stakeholders  and  recognizing publics.    Examples  include  internal  and  external  audiences,  American  domestic  audience, international  audience,  and adversaries. Budget  Program  Activity  Code  (BPAC)—AF  six-digit  budget  code  with  the  first  two-digits identifying  the  budget  program.   The  last  four  identify  the  project number. AFI35-101  12 JANUARY 2016   45  Budget Year—Next  fiscal  year  beyond  the  current  fiscal  year, i.e.,  upcoming  fiscal  year. Career  Field  Education  and  Training  Plan  (CFETP)—A  CFETP  is  a  comprehensive  core training document that  identifies  life-cycle education and  training requirements, training  support resources,  and  minimum core  task  requirements  for a specialty.  The CFETP establishes a clear career field  training  path. Commander’s  Communication  Synchronization  (CCS)—A  commander’s  planning  process that implements  higher- level  communication  guidance  by  facilitating  coordination  and synchronization  of  themes,  messages,  images,  actions,  and  operations.    The  process  ensures communication level  across  relevant communication  activities.    It  is  described  in  Joint  Doctrine  Note  2-13,  Commander’s Communication Synchronization. integrity  and  consistency the to lowest tactical Contract Manpower Equivalent (CME)—Expressions of  in-house  manpower  requirements at the  same  level  of  service  specified  in  the  contract.  CME  data  is  maintained  in  the  manpower programming  and execution  system  (MPES). Ele ments  of  Expense/Investment  Code  (EEIC)—The  lowest  breakout  within  the  budget structure.   It identifies  the  type of  expense  incurred  (e.g., EEIC  409 indicates  TDY  expenses). Emergency  and  Special  Program  Code  (ESP)—Identifies  and captures costs  incurred during emergencies  or  in  support  of  a  special  programs  to  obtain  reimbursement  of  AF  costs,  when appropriate.  Locally  used to track  various activities such as open  houses, snow removals, storm damage,  etc. Execution  Year—The  current  fiscal  year. Future  Years  Defense  Program  (FYDP)—Program  and  financial  plan  for  the  DOD  as approved  by  the  Secretary  of  Defense.  The  FYDP  arrays  cost  data,  manpower,  and  force structure over a  five- year period (force  structure  for an additional 3  years), portraying  this data by major force program for DOD internal review for the program and budget review submission. It is also  provided  to Congress  annually  in  conjunction  with  the President’s  Budget. Inherently  Governmental  Activities—An  activity  that  is  so  intimately  related  to  the  public interest  as  to  mandate  performance  by  government  personnel.    These  activities  require  the exercise  of  discretion  in  applying  government  authority,  the  use  of  value  judgment  in  making decisions  on behalf  of the government,  or obligation  of  funds/entitlements. Manpowe r  Authorization—A  funded  manpower  requirement  with  detail  that  defines  the position  in  terms  of  its  function,  organization,  location,  skill,  grade,  and  other  appropriate characteristics,  which  commands  use to extend  end  strength  resources  to units. Manpowe r  Programming  and  Execution  System  (MPES)—Online  management  information system designed to collect  and disseminate Total Force execution of programmed end strength. MPES  executes  the  Program  Objective  Memorandum  (POM)  and  the  President’s  Budget  (PB) allocated  end  strength  by  command  (usually  projected  over  seven  years  and  reflects  the manpower  officer/enlisted/civilian  requirements  constrained  by  the  manpower  budget).  MPES provides  commands  the  capability  to  organize  Air  Force  end  strength  into  units  required  to execute  Air  Force programs  and accomplish  unit  missions. Manpowe r Requirement—Human resources  needed  to accomplish a job,  mission, or program. There are two types:  funded and  unfunded.  Funded  manpower authorizations are positions  that   46  AFI35-101   12 JANUARY  2016 have been validated by A1 and allocated funding; meaning, a person can be assigned to it and the position  is  funded.    Unfunded  requirements  are  positions  that  have  been  validated  by  A1  but have  not  been  allocated  funding;  meaning,  a  person  cannot  be  assigned  to  it  because  the manpower  needs  have  been  deferred  due  to  budgetary  constraints.    Manpower  requirements generally are determined by an Air Force manpower standard or other management decision and are listed  on the  office’s  unit  manpower  document  (UMD). Manpowe r Standard—The basic tool used to determine the most effective and efficient level of manpower  required  to  support  a  function.  It  is  a  quantitative  expression  that  represents  a  work center's  man- hour  requirements  in  response  to  varying  levels  of  workload.    Manpower requirements  are based only  on MAJCOM or higher  headquarters  direction. the  Office  of  Personnel Occupational  Classification  Code Management to  identify specific qualifications  required of the civilian employee occupying the related  authorization. (OCC)—Established  by Performance—based  Work  State ment  (PWS)—A statement  in the solicitation  that  identifies the  technical,  functional,  and  performance  characteristics  of  the  agency’s  requirements.  The PWS is performance-based and describes  the agency’s needs (the  “what”),  not specific  methods for  meeting  those  needs  (the  “how”).  The  PWS  identifies  essential  services  (outcomes)  to  be achieved  and  specifies  the  agency’s  required  performance  standards,  and  the  location,  units, quality  and  timeliness  of  the work. Planning,  Programming,  Budgeting,  and  Execution  (PPBE)—Secretary  of  Defense’s resource  management  system  that  is  the  primary  means  to  control  allocation  of  resources. Identifies  mission  needs  (planning),  matches  them  with  resource  requirements  (programming), and  translates  them  into  budget  proposals  (budgeting).    Programs  and  budgets  are  formulated annually.   The  budget  covers one year,  and the  program  encompasses  an additional  four  years. Program  Element Code (PEC)—A combination of forces, manpower, equipment, and facilities related to a mission capability or activity. The PEC is the basic build ing block of the FYDP.  The first  five digits  relate to an  associated  DOD code,  while the  sixth digit  is coded with an  “F”  for Air  Force funds. Program  Objective  Memorandum  (POM)—OSD  directed,  service  developed  document identifying  money, people, and equip ment requirements and allocations over a  specified period of time, covering a five year period (e.g., FY16-20).  POM funding baselines are used to develop budget  level  detail  for  distribution  of  resources  during  budget  execution  years.  The  POM  is developed by individual services to set objectives for their forces, weapon systems, and logistical support  within  the fiscal  limits  assigned  to them  by the  Secretary  of  Defense. Public—A clearly defined  group of people  that  the Air Force  has an  interest  in  listening to and communicating  with.    Publics  can  be  segmented  from  the  population  a  variety  of  ways,  to include  geography,  demographics,  psychographics,  position,  membership,  role  in  decision making, etc.   The  more defined the public, the better PA can  tailor  the communication strategy and products.   Examples  include  first sergeants, squadron commanders, Air Force spouses, base residents,  retirees,  civilian  employees,  local  media,  and local  business  owners. Resource Management Decision (RMD)—A budget decision document issued during the joint review of Service budget submissions by OSD and OMB  analysts.   RMDs reflect  the decisions AFI35-101  12 JANUARY 2016   47  of  the Secretary of  Defense as  to appropriate program and  funding  to be  included  in the annual defense  budget  request  which,  in  turn,  is  included  in  the  President's  Budget. Responsibility  Center/Cost  Center  Code  (RC/CC)—The  RC  is  the  specific  organization  or agency responsible  for resource  management decisions and actions within a  functional area.   A Cost Center is a subordinate area within a RC, such as an organization subsection, that represents the  level  in  which  costs are incurred. Stakeholder—Individuals  or  groups  that  are  directly  impacted  by,  and  have  an  interest  in,  Air Force  operations,  actions  or  outcomes.    Stakeholders  are  natura lly  motivated  toward  action  if their  interests  are  involved  and  can  affect  mission  execution.    Depending  on  the  situation, stakeholders  may  be  the  same  as  publics.    Examples  include  employees,  civic  leaders  (e.g. government  officials,  business  leaders,  community  leaders),  newspaper  editors,  TV  station managers,  journalists,  bloggers,  AF  supporters  (e.g.  retirees,  defense/aerospace  industry, associations),  and Congress.    48  AFI35-101   12 JANUARY  2016 Attachment  2 DOD PRINCIPLES  OF INFORMATION A2.1.  Department  of  Defense  Principles  of  Information.  DOD  makes  available  timely  and accurate  information so that the public, Congress, and the  media  may assess and  understand the facts about  national  security and defense strategy.   Requests  for  information  from organizations and  private  citizens  shall  be  answered  in  a  timely  manner.    In  responding  to  requests,  the following  guidelines  apply: A2.1.1.  Information  will  be  fully  and  readily  available,  consistent  with  statutory  and regulatory  requirements,  unless  its  release  is  precluded  by  current  and  valid  security classification. The provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and the Privacy Act will  be supported  in  both letter  and spirit. A2.1.2.  A  free  flow  of  general  and  military  information  will  be  made  available,  without censorship  or propaganda,  to the men  and women  of  the Armed  Forces and their  dependents. A2.1.3.  Information  will  not be classified or otherwise  withheld to  protect  the  Government from  criticism  or embarrassment. A2.1.4.  Information will  be withheld only  when disclos ure  would adversely affect  national security,  threaten  the  safety  or  privacy  of  the  men  and  women  of  the  Armed  Forces,  or  if otherwise  authorized  by statute  or regulation. A2.1.5.  DOD’s obligation to provide the public with information on its major progra ms may require  detailed  public  affairs  planning  and  coordination  within  DOD  and  with  other Government  agencies.  The  sole  purpose  of  such  activity  is  to  expedite  the  flow  of information  to the  public;  propaganda  has no place  in  DOD public  affairs  programs.  AFI35-101  12 JANUARY 2016   49  Attachment  3 SAMPLE  WING PUBLIC  AFFAIRS  EMPLOYMENT/PRIORITIZATION  PLAN the  wing  Public  Affairs A3.1.  Overview.  This  attachment  provides  an  example  of employment/prioritization  plan.    PA  offices  should  modify  and/or  expand  the  plan  and attachments as  necessary to  meet  local  needs and priorities.   There are  four parts  to  the sample plan  beginning  with  the  commander’s  memo  (see  figure  A3.1),  followed  by  three  supporting attachments  including an outline of PA services and employment  guidelines (see  figure A3.2), a sample  PA  prioritization  matrix  (see  figure  A3.3),  and  a  sample  editorial  policy  (see  figure A3.4). Figure  A3.1.  Sample  Wing  Public  Affairs  Employment/Prioritization  Plan  – Commander’s Memo. MEMORANDUM  FOR  [INSTALLATION]  AIRMEN  FROM:   [XX]  WG/CC  SUBJECT:   Installation  Public  Affairs  (PA) Employment  Plan  1.  PA resources  are critical  to enhance  Airmen  morale  and readiness,  develop  public  trust  and support,  and support  global  influence  and deterrence.   It is  imperative  that  these  finite  resources be applied  toward  activities  which  most  directly  support  [XX  unit  (wing  abbreviation)],  [XX MAJCOM (MAJCOM abbreviation)]  and Air  Force priorities.   Inappropriate  use detracts  from the  ability  to support  these  priorities.     2.  This  memorandum  and associated  attachments  detail  the  [XX unit]/PA  employment  plan  as required  in  Air  Force Instruction  (AFI) 35-101, Public Affairs Responsibilities  and Management.  The products  and services  detailed  in  the  enclosed  guidance  are provided  for official  purposes  consistent  with  AFIs governing  PA activities;  unofficial  functions  that  are not related  to military  missions  or activities  will  not be supported.  3.  This  memorandum  and attachments  supersedes  all  previous  guidance  on the  same  subject and will  be reviewed  annually  by the [XX  unit]/PA  chief.   Please  contact  the  PA staff  with questions  at DSN 867-5309.     JOHN A. DOE, Col,  USAF Commander       3 Attachments: 1.  [XX unit]/PA  Services  and Employment  Guidelines 2.

Sample  Wing  Public  Affairs  Employment/Prioritization  Plan  – PA Services and  Employment  Guidelines. [XX unit]/PA  Services And  Employment  Guidelines  1.  Scope.  The  following  procedures  govern  the [XX  unit]/PA  office  as the lead  for  host-installation  PA activities  and  resources  in  support  of  units  assigned  to [INSTALLATION].   Individuals  in  units  with  organic  PA capabilities  should  first  coordinate  requests  through  their unit  PA office  prior  to contacting  [XX unit]/PA.  2.  PA Mission.  Air  Force PA advances  Air  Force priorities  and achieves  mission  objectives through  integrated  planning,  execution,  and assessment  of  communication  capabilities.   Through strategic  and responsive  release  of  accurate  and useful  information  and imagery  to Air  Force, domestic,  and international  audiences,  PA puts  operational  actions  into  context;  facilitates  the development  of informed  perceptions  about  Air  Force operations;  helps  undermine  adversarial propaganda  efforts;  and contributes  to the achievement  of national,  strategic,  and operational objectives.  3.  [XX unit]/PA  Services.  Services  available  from  the  [XX unit]/PA  office  are grouped  into four  categories  consistent  with  Air  Force Common  Output  Level  Standards  (AF COLS):     a.  Communication  Planning.   Provides  trusted  counsel  and communication  advice  to the commander  and other  staff  members  to enhance  mission  success.   Communication  planning is  important  to the  creation  of  strategic,  operational,  and tactical  effects  in  PA operations.     b.  PA Engagement.   Provides  community  engagement  programs  that  aim  to increase  public awareness  and understanding  of the mission,  policies,  operations  and programs  of  the AF; support  AF recruiting;  and maintain  a reputation  as a good neighbor.   This  includes  receiving requests  for  base services  from  the  community  such  as flyover  support,  public  speakers, and base tours.   Units  who  are asked for their  services  or personnel,  or who  receive  offers  of support  from  the  community  directly,  must  coordinate  these  with  PA (and JA when applicable)  prior  to committing  or accepting  resources.  c.  PA Operations.   Provides  programs  that  support  Airman  morale  and readiness,  public  trust and support,  and global  influence  and deterrence  through  the  release  of  timely  and accurate information  to Airmen,  their  families,  the public  and  the media.  (1)  Command  Information.   Provides  effective  and efficient  communication  tools  to link Airmen  with  their  leaders.   Command  information  helps  Airmen  and  their  families understand  their  purpose, role,  and value  to the  Air  Force.  A free  flow  of information  to Airmen  and their  families  creates awareness  of and  support  for the  mission,  increases their  effectiveness  as Air  Force ambassadors,  reduces  the spread of rumors  and AFI35-101  12 JANUARY 2016   51  misinformation,  and provides  avenues  for feedback.     (2)  Environmental.   Supports  environmental  program  objectives  and requirements  by facilitating  public  notification  and involvement  and communicating  the  Air  Force’s commitment  to environmental  excellence.     (3)  Media  Operations.   Facilitates  engagement  and two-way  communication  with  the media,  which  is  often  one of the  most  rapid  and credible  means  of  delivering  the commander’s  message.   Remaining  open, honest,  and accessible  to the  maximum  extent possible  normally  results  in  greater  accuracy,  context,  and timeliness  in  communicating with  internal  and external  audiences.     Personnel  assigned  to [installation  and/or  specific units]  will  coordinate  all  official  media  requests  and queries  through  the [XX  unit]/PA office.  (4)  Security  and Policy  Review.   Ensures  information  intended  for  public  release  will neither  adversely  affect  national  security  nor  threaten  the  safety,  security,  or privacy  of Air  Force personnel,  while  adhering  to the  policy  of “maximum  disclosure,  minimum delay.”   Personnel  must  obtain  necessary  security  and policy  review  before  releasing official  imagery,  documents,  information,  or proposed statements  outside  the  Air  Force.  d.  Visual  Information  (VI).   Provides  programs  that  collect,  preserve  and accession  VI products  to meet  operational,  informational,  training,  research,  legal,  historical  and administrative  needs.  Visual  products,  such  as photo, video,  and graphics,  are catalysts  for effective  communication  and document  the Air  Force’s visual  history,  through  the accessioning  process, for future  generations.     5.  Availability.   The  PA office  will  be manned  during  normal  duty  hours.   A PA representative will  be on-call  24 hours  a day, 7 days  a week (including  holidays),  and will  accomplish emergency  services  as required  by security  forces,  the  Air  Force Office  of  Special  Investigations, the  safety  office  and/or  wing  leadership.   During  non-duty  hours,  the on-call  PA representative can be contacted  through  the  command  post.  6.  Requesting Support.   Submit  PA support  requests  to the  [XX unit]/PA  email  account  at [XX]@us.af.mil  as far  in  advance  as possible;  requests  for  VI support  should  be submitted  with  a completed  Air  Force Form  833 attached.   Advance  notice  provides  PA the  ability  to ensure  the necessary  equipment  and personnel  are available.   Failure  to coordinate  in  advance  will  reduce the  likelihood  that  the  event  can receive  PA support.   Consumer-grade  still  and video  equipment is  available  for  self-help  use on a first-come,  first-served  basis  when  the  PA staff  is  already scheduled  to support  higher  or equal  priority  tasks.  7.  Prioritized  Employment  Plan.   The  [XX unit]/PA  office  provides  support  according  to the following  system  focused  on the commander’s  priorities,  operational  core tasks, urgency, mission  impact,  agencies  supported,  and resources  available.   This  system  helps  control  the  flow of work and ensures  all  mission-critical  needs are met.   A detailed  list  of services  and their associated  priority  level  can be found  at the  enclosed  prioritization/employment  matrix (attachment  2):   52  AFI35-101   12 JANUARY  2016   a. Core services  are services  that  directly  support  emergent  or operational  mission requirements. (1)  Priority  one requests  include  support  for  time-critical  official  investigations,  crisis response,  and other  requests  directly  impacting  the  ability  of the  installation  to perform its  operational  mission.   This  includes  alert  documentation  for  evidentiary  and decisional purposes,  and assisting  senior  leaders  with  public  and media  interaction  during emergencies  and contingencies.  (2)  Priority  two requests  include  support  for  non-time-sensitive  official  investigations, combat  readiness,  critical  items  in  direct  support  of priorities  and initiatives  of commanders  at wing  level  or higher,  operational  test and evaluation  missions,  and MAJCOM-directed  support.   This  priority  also  entails  communication  to stakeholders and key publics  in  support  of official  goals  and objectives.     b.  Non-core services  are defined  as services  that  do not  directly  affect  an operational  mission requirement.  (1)  Priority  three  requests  include  routine  support  for education  and  training,  unit-level command  information,  wing-level  official  recognition  programs,  and installation  support.   This  generally  includes  routine  communication  with  internal  and external  audiences.  (2)  Priority  four  requests  include  all  other  production  services  not outlined  above.  It is possible  requests  in  this  priority  level  may  need to be fulfilled  through  self-help  services.  (3)  Priority  five  requests  are items  that  have  been  specifically  designated  as self-help services  only.     8.  Restrictions.    a.  IAW AFI 35-109, government-funded  PA and VI resources  will  not  be used to:  (1)  Provide  souvenirs,  personal  gifts,  mementos,  or farewell  gifts.   Examples  include “hero”  shots  in  front  of aircraft  cockpits  (unless  provided  as part of a Distinguished Visitor  (DV)  orientation  flight),  booster club  promotional  items,  group  photos intended  to commemorate  events  such  as golf  tournaments  or recreational  gatherings,  and sports team photos.  (2)  Support or document  farewell  parties  or social  events  unless  certified  as newsworthy or having  historical  significance  by the base historian  or chief  of  PA.  When  an event  is determined  to be historically  significant,  PA resources  may  be provided  to meet  official news  and documentation  requirements  only.  (3)  Create products  used primarily  for  entertainment  during  farewell  parties  or social events. AFI35-101  12 JANUARY 2016   53   (4)  Support MWR- or services-sponsored  recognition  programs.  b.  Altering  imagery.   Air  Force PA offices  are trusted  agents.   Because  PA professionals create products  that  can  be used in  legal  proceedings  and for  critical  decision-making, absolute  trust  and confidence  in  the truthfulness  of products  they  create is  essential.   Official imagery  may  not be altered,  unless  it  is  specifically  exempted  by Department  of  Defense Instruction  (DODI)  5040.02, Visual Information.  Examples  of requests  that  will  not  be supported  include  changes  to personal  appearance  in  an official  portrait  and digitally  adding or removing  content  to a photo  or changing  the photo  in  a way  that  misrepresented  the  facts or circumstances  of the  event  captured.  c.  Use of Copyrighted  Materials.   Using  copyrighted  media  requires  a separate  license  or explicit  permission.   Generally,  both  music  and programs  recorded from  broadcasts are copyrighted.   Having  the source  recording  or music  score does not confer  any  right  to reproduce,  transfer,  or otherwise  use  or perform  the recorded material,  either  as a whole  or in part.  Refer  to AFI 51-303, Intellectual Property--Patents, Patent Related Matters, Trademarks and Copyrights, for guidance.  d.  Morale,  Welfare  and Recreation  (MWR)  Support.   MWR and Services  activities  are authorized  support  for Category  A (Mission  Sustaining)  and Category  B (Basic  Community Support  Activities).   Category  A programs  are essential  to the  military  mission  and are authorized  all  support.   Category  B activities  are closely  related  to Category  A activities  and are essentially  community  support  programs.   The PA office  can furnish  support  to these activities  as long  as the MWR  activity  does not generate  revenue.   For additional  clarification of MWR activities,  refer  to AFI 65-106, Appropriated Fund Support of Morale, Welfare, and Recreation and Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities.  9.  Additional  Considerations.  a.  Studio  Photography.   Studio  photography  is  by appointment  only  and available  for official portraits  as required  by AFI as well  as applications  for  special  duty  assignments,  official passports,  and citizenship  applications.   Chain-of-command  studio  photography  will  be provided  for  leadership  at the squadron-level  and above (commander,  deputy/vice commander,  senior  enlisted  leader,  and first  sergeant)  as well  as quarterly  and annual  award winners  at the  group-level  and above.  Electronic  copies  and one hard copy up to size  8x10 will  be provided  to the  requestor.    b.  Group  Photos.   Units  at the squadron-level  and  above are authorized  one group  photo [timeframe]  (e.g.  annually).  c.  VI Equipment  Purchase  Review.   IAW AFI 35-109, Visual Information, units  wishing  to purchase  video  or still  cameras  and photographic  printers  must  receive  approval  from  [XX unit]/PA  to preclude  duplication  of effort  and  to ensure  equipment,  system,  and data compatibility.   54  AFI35-101   12 JANUARY  2016 Figure  A3.3.

In some  cases, an item  that  falls  into  one priority  level  (for  example,  priority  level  three)  may  receive  support  at a higher  priority  level  (for  example,  priority  level  two)  if  deemed necessary  by  the [XX  unit]/PA chief.  3)  Items  that  fall  into  a category  not  listed  in  this  matrix  will  be prioritized  at the  discretion  of the  [XX unit]/PA  chief.  PA NOTES (not for inclusion  in finalized prioritization/employment plans):   1)  This matrix and priority levels should be adjusted based on the local mission and commander’s intent.  As a result, an item that is assigned priority level three at one organization may be assigned a different priority level at different organization.  2)  The AFI references above include helpful portions of the 35-series  AFIs and applicable   56  AFI35-101   12 JANUARY  2016 chapter(s) or section(s), when able.  Some AFIs, for example AFI 35-107, are not divided into chapters or sections and the chart refers to the full AFI in those cases.  Additionally, the list of AFIs may not be all-inclusive  to each reference of the listed capabilities  and PA offices are encouraged to supplement the matrix with other AFIs and local operating instructions, as needed. Figure  A3.4.  Sample  Wing  Public  Affairs  Employment/Prioritization  Plan  – Editorial Policy. [XX unit]/PA  Editorial  Policy for  Official  Print,  Web and  Social Media Publications   1.  Delegation of Editorial  Review.  The  [XX  unit]/CC  exercises  editorial  control  over  official print,  web, and social  media  publications  for [INSTALLATION].   Day-to-day oversight  and responsibility  for  these  activities  is delegated  to the  [XX unit]/PA  chief.   The  determination  on of an event’s  newsworthy  value  is at the discretion  of the [XX  unit]/PA  chief  based on an assessment  of how  well  the proposed coverage  supports  the commander’s  communication priorities.  2.  Base Newspaper.  The [INSERT]  newspaper  is produced  by an off-base  civilian  publisher  at no cost to the  government.   While  the  publisher  pulls  coverage  from  the [INSTALLATION] website  as well  as other  Air  Force and DOD sources,  the [XX  unit]  does not  have  authority  over the  publication,  its  layout,  or advertising  content.  3.  Base Website.  The  official  website  for  [INSTALLATION]  is  operated by the [XX  unit]/PA staff  and  is located  at www.[INSERT].af.mil.   Only  information  cleared  for  public  release  in accordance  with  AFI 35-107, Public Web Communications, and other  associated  policies  and instructions  can be posted to the  site.  a.  Section  508 Compliance.   In  1998, Congress  amended  the  U.S. Rehabilitation  Act of 1973 to require  that  federal  agencies  make  their  electronic  and  information  technology  accessible to people  with  disabilities.   Section  508, 1194.22, Web-based Intranet  and Internet Information  and  Applications,  is  of particular  importance  with  regard  to  website management.   This  section  outlines  the  requirements  for  federal  websites,  both Internet  and intranet.   It states that  federal  websites  must  meet  the  needs of disabled  employees  and members  of the  public  and allow  them  access to Internet  technology  in  a format  understood by software  readers/viewers.  4.  Content.   News, feature,  and editorial  material  will  conform  to policies  of  the Air  Force and the  [XX unit]/CC.   Coverage  will  be factual  and objective  and avoid  morbid,  sensational,  or alarming  details  not essential  to factual  reporting.   Accuracy  is  paramount.   Individuals  to be interviewed  and photographed  must  meet  all  requirements  of AFI 36-2903, Dress and Personal Appearance of Air Force Personnel, and  must  comply  with  current  safety,  security,  and technical  order requirements.  a.  News Content.   News content  is  based on local  articles  developed  by the  PA staff  and releases  by the Air  Force News Service,  MAJCOM news services,  American  Forces Press Service,  and other  agencies  of the  DOD and federal  government.    AFI35-101  12 JANUARY 2016   57   b.  Editorial  and Opinion.   Locally  originated  editorials  (command  position)  and commentaries  (personal  opinions)  will  reflect  the policies  of the  commander  and  will  be in the  interest  of the  Air  Force.  Editorials  should  help  readers understand  Air  Force policies and programs.  They  must  not imply  criticism  of  other  governmental  agencies,  nor advocate or dispute  specific  political,  diplomatic,  or legislative  matters.  c.  Articles  of local  interest  to base people  produced outside  official  channels  (e.g. stringers, local  organizations)  may  be used  provided  permission  has been obtained,  the source  is credited,  and they  do not  otherwise  violate  this  instruction.

These  sites  are operated by the  [XX unit]/PA  office  using  the same  guidelines  as the  official website  and print  publications.   Subordinate  and tenant  organizations,  with  the exception  of units  with  their  own  PA office,  are not authorized  to operate official  social  media  pages without  the approval  of  the [XX  unit]/PA  chief.   Unofficial  pages (e.g.  booster club  pages, alumni  pages,  etc.) are not  official  Air  Force social  media  sites  and are encouraged  to display a disclaimer  that  the page  is not  an official  representation  of the  Air  Force.   b.  Personal  Use.  In general,  the  Air  Force views  personal  websites,  blogs,  and social  media sites  positively,  and it  respects the  right  of Airmen  to use them  as a medium  of self-expression.   However,  as members  of the  Air  Force, Airmen  must  abide  by certain restrictions  to ensure  good order and discipline.   All  Airmen  are on duty  24 hours  a day, 365 days a year,  and their  actions  on and off  duty  are subject  to the  Uniform  Code of Military Justice  (UCMJ).  See AFI 1-1, Air Force Standards, and AFI 35-113, Internal Information, for  more  guidelines  regarding  personal  social  media  use.   58  AFI35-101   12 JANUARY  2016 Attachment  4 SAMPLE  WING LEVEL  PUBLIC  AFFAIRS  EXECUTION  PLAN  DEVELOPMENT CYCLE.
