This chapter outlines the minimum training and currencies required for sailplane- qualified  aircrew,  and  provides  for  development  of  individual  IPs  through  additional certifications, and instructor development (ID) sorties. Units may direct  additional training in  a supplement to this instruction. Units will track all pilot ground and flying training requirements in ARMS.  (T-2).  (Refer to ETCA for ancillary training.) 4.2.  Training Cycle.  There is one annual training cycle: 1 June to 31 May. 4.3.  Quarterly Meetings: 4.3.1.  CT  Meetings.  Commanders  will  direct  and  supervise  quarterly  CT  meetings.  (T-2).  The purpose of these meetings is to discuss standardization and mission-related topics and to increase general knowledge. A CRM topic or scenario will be discussed in each CT meeting referring to CRM core concepts from AFI 11-290.  (T-2). 4.3.2.  IP  Meetings. Commanders  will  direct  and  supervise  quarterly  IP  meetings.  (T-2).  Commanders  will  use  these  meetings  to  discuss  standardization,  instructional  techniques, grading practices, and recent trends. These meetings may be combined with CT meetings if all topics are adequately covered. 4.3.3.  Attendance.  Attendance at CT and IP meetings is mandatory. The unit will determine a  method  to  track  CT  and  IP  meeting  attendance  as  part  of  the  go/no-go  process  for  flight.  (T-2).  Individual who are not available for CT or IP meetings will read the meeting minutes or be briefed by an operations supervisor before their next flight.  (T-2). 4.4.  Ground  Training  Requirements.  Table  4.1  summarizes  sailplane  pilot  ground  training requirements. (T-2).   For ground training prescribed by other instructions, units must reference those  instructions  for  the  latest  requirement.    (T-2).
