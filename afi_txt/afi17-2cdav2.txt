Recommendations  for  improvements  to this  volume  will  be  submitted  on  AF  Form  847,  through  the  appropriate  Functional  chain  of command to HQ USAF/A3CX/A6CX. Approved recommendations will be collated into interim or formal change notices, and forwarded to HQ 24 AF/A3T for HQ 24 AF/A3 approval. 1.3.  Waivers.  Unless  another  approval  authority  is  cited  ("T-0,  T-1,  T-2,  T-3"),  waiver authority for this volume is the MAJCOM/A3 (or equivalent).  Submit requests for waivers using AF  Form  679,  Air  Force  Publication  Compliance  Item  Waiver  Request/Approval,  through  the chain  of  command  to  the  appropriate  Tier  waiver  approval  authority.  If  approved,  waivers remain  in  effect  for  the  life  of  the  published  guidance,  unless  the  waiver  authority  specifies  a shorter period of time, cancels in writing, or issues a change that alters the basis for the waiver. 1.4.  Procedures: 1.4.1.  Standardization and Evaluation Examiners (SEEs) will use the grading policies in AFI 17-202V2  and  the  evaluation  criteria  in  this  instruction  volume  for  conducting  all  AFSPC and  AFSPC-oversight  units’  weapon  system  performance,  Cybercrew  Training  Device (CTD),  and  Emergency  Procedures  Evaluations  (EPE).  All  evaluations  assume  a  stable platform  and  normal  operating  conditions.  Compound  emergency  procedures  (multiple simultaneous EPEs) will not be used. 1.4.2.  Each squadron will design and maintain evaluation profiles for each mission/weapon system  that  includes  information  on  each  crew  position.  These  profiles,  approved  by Operations  Group  Standardization/Evaluation  (OGV),  should  outline  the  minimum  number and  type  of  events  to  be  performed/observed  to  satisfy  a  complete  evaluation.  Evaluation profiles  will  incorporate  requirements  established  in  the  applicable  grading  criteria  and reflect the primary unit tasking. (T-3) 1.4.3.  All  evaluations  fall  under  the  categories  listed  in  AFI  17-202V2.  For  dual/multiple qualification  or  difference  evaluations  that  do  not  update  an  eligibility  period,  list  as  Spot Evaluation  (SPOT)  on  the  front  of  the  AF  Form  4418,  Certificate  of  Cybercrew Qualification, and explain it was a difference evaluation under "Mission Description."  (T-3) 1.4.3.1.  Schedule  all  evaluation  activity  on  one  mission/sortie  to  the  greatest  extent possible. All  performance phase requirements should be accomplished during a training (or  operational  if  training  not  available)  mission/sortie.  If  a  required  event  is  not accomplished during a mission/sortie, the event may be completed in the CTD. This may AFI17-2CDAV2  7 JUNE 2017 5 be  delegated  no  lower  than  SQ/CC  unless  otherwise  authorized  in  position  specific chapters of this instruction volume. (T-2) 1.4.3.2.  During  all  evaluations,  any  grading  areas  observed  by  the  evaluator  may  be evaluated. If additional training is required for areas outside of the scheduled evaluation, document the training required under the appropriate area on the AF Form 4418. (T-2) 1.4.3.3.  This  AFI  contains a table of requirements  for the  written requisites and a table for  the  grading  criteria  for  various  evaluations.  Each  table  may  include  a  "Note"  which refers to  a  general  note  found in  the individual  grading  criteria,  and/or  a  number which refers  to  a  note  shown  below  the  table.  To  complete  an  evaluation,  all  areas  annotated with an "R" must be successfully completed. (T-2) 1.4.3.4.  Unit  examiners  may  administer  evaluations  outside  of  their  organization  to include  evaluations  between  MAJCOMs,  provided  written  agreements/understandings between the affected organizations are in-place. Written agreements/understandings shall be reviewed and updated annually. (T-3) 1.4.4.  Cumulative deviations should be considered when determining the overall grade. The SEE  will  state  the  examinee’s  overall  rating,  review  with  the  examinee  the  area  grades assigned,  thoroughly  critique  specific  deviations,  and  recommend/assign  any  required additional training. (T-3) 1.4.5.  SEEs  will  not  evaluate  students  with  whom the qualification/upgrade training or those they recommend for qualification/upgrade evaluation without SQ/CC approval. (T-3) instructed  50%  of they 1.4.6.  All  crewmembers  for  the  sortie  (to  include  students,  instructors,  examinees,  and evaluators) will participate in and adhere to all required mission planning, mission briefing, mission  execution,  and  mission  debriefing  requirements.  All  crewmembers  must  be  current on  Crew  Information  File  (CIF)  and  meet  all  Go/No-Go  requirements  IAW  AFI  17-202 series  instructions,  this  instruction,  and  all  applicable  supplemental  guidance  prior  to operating, instructing, or evaluating on the weapon system. (T-2) 1.5.  General Evaluation Requirements: 1.5.1.  Publications  Check.  In  units  where  crewmembers  are  individually  issued  technical orders,  operating  manuals,  checklists,  crew  aids,  etc.,  for  use  in  conducting  operations,  a publications check will be accomplished for all evaluations.  The publications check will be annotated  in  the  comments  block  of  the  AF  Form  4418  only  if  unsatisfactory.  List  of Effective Pages (LEP) and annual “A” page checks in individually issued operating manuals must  be  accomplished,  documented,  and  current.  OGV  will  list  the  minimum  required operating  publications  each  cybercrew  member  is  responsible  for  in  the  unit  CIF  Library and/or  unit  supplement  to  AFI  17-202V2.  NOTE:    In  units  where  such  resources  are  not individually  issued  but  made  available/accessible  for  common  use,  the  squadron  Stan/Eval office  will  list  those  items  (version  and  date)  and  ensure  the  accuracy  and  currency  of  the information contained in those. (T-2) 1.5.2.  Written Examinations:  6 AFI17-2CDAV2  7 JUNE 2017 1.5.2.1.  The requisites in  Table 1.1 are common to  all CDA crew positions and will be accomplished  IAW  AFI  17-202V2,  all  applicable  supplemental  guidance,  and  unit directives.  These  will  be  accomplished  prior  to  the  sortie  performance  phase  unless  in conjunction with an No Notice (N/N) Qualification (QUAL). NOTE:  A N/N evaluation conducted  in  the  examinee’s  eligibility  period  and  meeting  all  required  QUAL  profile requirements  affords  the  examinee  to  opt  for  the  N/N  evaluation  to  satisfy  a  periodic QUAL,  in  which  case  the  examinee  may  complete  written  and  Emergency  Procedures Evaluations  (EPE)  requisites  after  the  performance  phase.  However,  the  written examination(s) and EPE must be completed prior to the examinee’s expiration date. (T-2) 1.5.3.  Emergency  Procedures  Evaluations  (EPE).  Every  Qualification  evaluation  which updates  an  expiration  date  will  include  an  EPE.  Qualification  EPEs  will  evaluate  the crewmember’s  knowledge  and/or  performance  of  emergency  procedures,  to  include  use  of emergency  equipment.  Use  the  Emergency  Procedures/Equipment  grading  criteria  for  all emergency  situations.  Use  Systems  Knowledge/Operations  grading  criteria  to  evaluate general systems operation. An EPE may be accomplished prior to the mission with any unit SEE  conducting  a  scenario-based  evaluation  using  question/answer  (Q&A)  techniques, preferably  during  the  SEE  pre-brief  with  the  examinee.  Units  will  determine  scenarios  for EPEs. The SEE will assign an overall EPE grade (1 or 3). Document the accomplishment and result  of  the  EPE  in  the  Written  Phase  block  of  Section  II  Qualification  on  the  AF  Form 4418. (T-3) Table 1.1.  Crew Position Specific Requirements - Written Examinations. Examination Type CDA-A QUAL CDA-OC QUAL O R R O R R OPEN BOOK  (Note 1) CLOSED BOOK (Note 2) EPE R – Required; O – Optional  NOTES: 1. Units may administer OPEN BOOK exams at their discretion, however it is not required.  If utilized, exams shall consist of a minimum of 40 questions derived from applicable operations manuals and governing directives. OG/OGV will determine the necessary number of questions to be included for each weapon system and crew position. (T-3)  2. The CLOSED BOOK exam consists of a minimum of 25 questions derived from applicable operations manuals and governing directives. OG/OGV will determine the necessary number of questions to be included for each weapon system and crew position. (T-3) 1.5.4.  Qualification  (QUAL)  Evaluations.  These  evaluations  measure  a  crewmember’s ability  to  meet  grading  areas  listed  on  Table  1.2.  at  the  end  of  this  chapter  and  defined  in Chapter  2  of  this  instruction.  IAW  AFI  17-202V2  and  lead  MAJCOM  guidance,  QUAL evaluations may be combined with MSN evaluations. When practical, an individual’s QUAL evaluation  may  be  combined  with  their  Instructor  evaluation,  as  applicable  for  the  crew position. (T-2)  AFI17-2CDAV2  7 JUNE 2017 7 1.5.5.  Special  Mission  Qualification  (SMQ)  upgrade  CLOSED  BOOK  exam  is  a  separate closed book exam consisting of a minimum 25 questions specific to the SMQ derived from applicable operations manuals and governing directives. For initial SMQ evaluations that are not combined with the member’s periodic QUAL (for the primary crew position), the SMQ exam  is  the  only  required  exam.    Subsequent  (periodic)  SMQ  evaluations  should  be combined  with  the  member’s  periodic  QUAL  evaluation,  therefore,  requiring  the  written requisites to consist of the applicable OPEN BOOK, CLOSED BOOK, and applicable SMQ exam(s). (T-2) 1.5.6.  Mission  (MSN)  Evaluations.  IAW  AFI  17-202V2  and  lead  MAJCOM  guidance,  the requirement  for  a  separate  MSN  evaluation  may  be  combined  with  the  QUAL  evaluation. The various procedures and techniques used throughout the different weapon system variants are  managed  through  a  training  program  which  results  in  a  mission  certification.  Mission certifications  will  be  IAW  17-202  Vol  1,  AFI  17-2CDA  Vol  1,  and  all  applicable supplements  and  will  be  documented  in  the  appropriate  training  folder.  MSN  and  SMQ evaluation grading areas are also listed on Table 1.2. at the end of this chapter and defined in Chapter 2 of this instruction. (T-2) 1.5.6.1.  For  crewmembers  who  maintain  multiple  mission  certifications,  recurring evaluations  need  only  evaluate  the  primary  mission  events  as  long  as  currency  is maintained in all other required training events. (T-2) 1.5.7.  Instructor Evaluations. Grading areas for these evaluations are listed on Table 1.2. at the  end  of  this  chapter.  See  Chapter  3  of  this  instruction  for  amplified  information  and grading area definitions. (T-2) 1.5.8.  Stan/Eval  Examiner  (SEE)  Objectivity  Evaluations.  Grading  areas  for these evaluations  are  listed  on  Table  1.2.  at  the  end  of  this  chapter.  See  Chapter  4  of  this instruction for amplified information and grading area definitions. (T-2) 1.5.9.  No-Notice Evaluations. OG/CC will determine no-notice evaluation procedures/goals. (T-3) 1.6.  Grading  Instructions.  Standards  and  performance  parameters  are  contained  in  AFI  17-202V2 and this instruction. A three-level grading system is used for most areas; however a "Q-" grade will not be indicated under critical areas. (T-3) 1.6.1.  Critical Area/Subarea. Critical areas are events that require adequate accomplishment by  the  examinee  to  successfully  and  safely  achieve  the  mission/sortie  objectives  and complete  the  evaluation.  These  events,  if  not  adequately  accomplished  could  result  in mission failure, endanger human life, or cause serious injury or death. Additionally, critical areas/subareas  apply  to  time-sensitive  tasks  or  tasks  that  must  be  accomplished  as expeditiously  as  possible  without  any  intervening  lower  priority  actions  that  would,  in  the normal  sequence  of  events,  adversely  affect  task  performance/outcome.  If  an  examinee receives  a  "U"  grade  in  any  critical  area,  the  overall  grade  for  the  evaluation  will  be  "Q3." Critical areas are identified by "(C)" following the applicable area title. (T-2)   8  AFI17-2CDAV2  7 JUNE 2017 1.6.2.  Major  Area/Subarea.  Major  areas  are  events  or  tasks  deemed  integral  to  the performance of other tasks and required to sustain acceptable weapon system operations and mission execution. If an examinee receives a "U" grade in a non-critical area then the overall grade  awarded will be no higher than  "Q2." An  examinee receiving  a  "Q-"  grade in  a non-critical area or areas may still receive a "Q1" overall grade at evaluator discretion. An overall "Q3" can be awarded if, in the judgment of the flight examiner, there is justification based on performance in one or several areas/sub areas. (T-2) 1.6.3.  The SEE must  exercise judgment  when the wording of  areas is  subjective and when specific situations are not covered. Evaluator judgment will be the final determining factor in deciding the overall qualification level. (T-2)  AFI17-2CDAV2  7 JUNE 2017 9 Table 1.2.

The SEE Examiner will administer a pre-brief and debrief to the SEE Examinee. (T-2) 4.3.7.  For SEE Upgrade candidates, SEE Objectivity evaluations will only  be  administered for observed INIT QUAL or periodic QUAL evaluations. Additionally, the QUAL evaluation may not be combined with an Instructor Evaluation. (T-2) 4.4.  SEE  Objectivity  Evaluation  Grading  Criteria.  All  SEE  Objectivity  Evaluation  Criteria must be observed and graded to ensure a complete evaluation. The following grading criteria will be  used  by  SEEs  when  conducting  SEE  Objectivity  Evaluations.  A  grade  of  Q-  requiring additional training or a grade of U in any area for the SEE Objectivity Examinee will require an overall  rating  of  “3”.  Cumulative  deviations  will  be  considered  when  determining  the  overall rating of either “1” or “3”.  Specific requirements for each evaluation are as follows: 4.4.1.  AREA 23, Directives Compliance/Understanding 4.4.1.1.  Q.  Complied  with  and  understood  all  operational  directives  and  guidance.
