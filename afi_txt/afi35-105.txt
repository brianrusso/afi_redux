Purpose  of  Community  Engagement.  Community  and  public  engagement  is  a  crucial Departmental activity that reinforces trust and confidence in the United States military and in its most  important  asset  –  people.  Proactive  community  outreach  ensures  we  connect  with  the American  people  and  our  partner  nations  outside  the  continental  United  States  (OCONUS)  to inspire  the  best  and  most  qualified  candidates  to  serve;  support  our  troops  at  home  and  in dangerous places throughout the world; and ultimately transition our military families back into communities  ready  to  support  them  through  education,  employment,  and  wellness  initiatives. These  proactive  engagements  showcase  our  superior  combat  power,  demonstrate  readiness  to defend the Nation, and help to preserve the all-volunteer force.  Effective engagement builds an informed  public  that  is  more  inclined  to  support  military  operations  and  less  susceptible  to  the effects of adversary misinformation or inaccurate information in the public sphere. 1.1.1.  Community  Engagement.  Community  engagement  encompasses  activities  of  interest to  the general  public, businesses, academia, veterans, service organizations, military-related associations,  and  other  non-news  media  entities.  Targeted  engagements  with  and  through various groups enhance  mutual  understanding,  cooperation, and support  necessary to  create desired effects that support the Air Force’s communications objectives. There are also other programs  managed  externally  from  public  affairs  that  have  a  community  engagement component (i.e. encroachment management, Air Installation Compatible Use Zone (AICUZ) program, and science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) outreach, etc.). 1.2.  Objectives of Community Engagement. 1.2.1.  Increase  public  awareness  and  understanding  of  the  armed  forces  and  the  mission, policies, and programs of the Air Force. 1.2.2.  Support Air Force recruiting by inspiring patriotism and encouraging men and women to serve in the military. 1.2.3.  Maintain  a  reputation  as  a  good  neighbor  as  well  as  a  respected  and  professional organization charged with the responsibility of national security. 1.2.4.  Preserve  new  and  enduring  overseas  relationships  with  allies,  coalition,  and  multi-national partners.  AFI35-105  23 JUNE 2017 7 Chapter 2 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.

Except  where  prohibited  by  this  instruction,  MAJCOM commanders,  AFRC  commander,  and  the  ANG  commander  have  the  authority  to  approve  the use  of  community  engagement  resources  (speakers,  bands,  honor  guard,  etc.).  They  may  grant approval authority to appropriate subordinate commanders at their discretion. Wing commanders must refer proposals for community engagement programs exceeding local support capability or the  scope  of  local  PA  responsibility  to  the  MAJCOM  or  next  level  higher  headquarters  with  a description  of  the  anticipated  scope  of  the  program,  comments  concerning  expected  civilian reaction,  recommendations,  and  predicted  benefits.  Coordinators  requesting  approvals  should provide  event  information  to  the  local  Air  Force  Office  of  Special  Investigations  (AFOSI)  for their  situational  awareness.  Ensure  all  community  engagement  planning,  coordinating  and execution  is  in  accordance  with  DODD  5400.7  and  AFI  33-332,  Air  Force  Privacy  and  Civil Liberties Program (T-1). SAF/PA and/or OASD/PA will retain approving authority for events in paragraph 3.1.1. 3.1.1.  OASD/PA will approve: 3.1.1.1.  Public Affairs participation in programs outside the United States. Requests are coordinated with the COCOM Public Affairs, SAF/PA and OASD/PA. (T-0) 3.1.1.2.  Aerial  review  requests  involving  more  than  one  service,  or  multiple  types  of aircraft. (T-0) 3.1.1.3.  Preseason,  postseason,  or  known  programmed  national  sports  and  professional athletic events and other national level events within the United States. SAF/PA approves with notification to OASD/PA, as required. (T-0) 3.1.2.  SAF/PAY will approve: 3.1.2.1.  All Air Force support of community relations programs in the National Capital Region (NCR), except speaking engagements to foreign groups. The NCR is defined by DODI  4515.14,  DOD  Support  for  Travel  of  Members  and  Employees  of  Congress,  and includes  the  District  of  Columbia;  Montgomery  and  Prince  George’s  counties  in Maryland; Arlington, Fairfax, Loudoun, and Prince William counties in Virginia; and the cities of Alexandria, Fairfax, and Falls Church in Virginia.

Submit  a  completed  tour  plan,  to  include justification, for review through MAJCOM/ PA offices and to SAF/PAY before making commitments  or  formally  inviting  guests.  (T-1).    For  guidance  on  preparing  tour  plans, wing PA offices will coordinate with their respective MAJCOM/PA. 3.1.2.6.  Proper  level  of  support  for  aircraft,  related  equipment,  and  support  personnel requests  for  participation  in  public  events  such  as  airshows,  flyovers  or  national  level events. 3.1.3.  Commanders. 3.1.3.1.  Wing commanders are authorized to participate routinely in local events jointly planned and conducted by border communities of the United States, Mexico, and Canada. Local  unit  commanders  are  required  to  consult  with  NORTHCOM/PA,  SAF/PAY  and appropriate U.S.  consular officials  in  the Mexican and  Canadian communities involved. (T-0). 3.1.3.2.  MAJCOM  commanders.  Within  the  United  States,  MAJCOMs  coordinate community  engagement  programs  and  public  events  with  combatant  and  specified commands  significantly  affected.  DOD  requires  combatant/specified  commands  to coordinate with HQ USAF and MAJCOMs on programs requiring Air Force support. (T-0) 3.1.3.3.  Combatant Commanders. Per the Secretary of Defense, combatant commanders will  be  responsible  for  approving  and  participating  in  overseas  public  events.  This authority may be delegated. While Air Force MAJCOMs overseas operate their programs to  conform  to  this  regulation,  policy  direction  and  guidance  provided  by  combatant command  headquarters  takes  precedence.  Air  Force  MAJCOMs  overseas  must  also advise SAF/PA when taking part in any public event that significantly affects operations, garners  international  media  coverage  or  requires  major  administrative,  financial,  or logistical support. 3.2.  Participation  in  Public  Events.  Air  Force  participation  and  use  of  equipment  in  public events  enhances  public  understanding  of  the  Air  Force  mission.  Within  legal  and  policy limitations,  commanders  at  all  levels  who  plan  or  conduct  a  community  engagement  program must  consider  the  interests  of  the  Air  Force  and  the  community  as  a  whole.  (T-1).  Since limitations of time and money make it impossible to grant all requests, public affairs will take all appropriate requests into equal consideration and recommend approval based on common factors that are in the best interests of the Air Force and taxpayer. (T-1). 3.2.1.  Participation Guidelines: 3.2.1.1.  Noninterference basis. Ensure there is minimal interference with normal training or  operational  activities,  the  event  is  economically  feasible,  and  that  appropriate resources are available. 3.2.1.2.  Transportation.  For  base  visits,  transportation  may  be  provided  without reimbursement, except airlift, if it makes the visit more efficient and is in the best interest of the Air Force. Reference AFI 24-301, Vehicle Operations. 3.2.1.3.  Endorsement  of  Entertainment  Groups.  Allowing  groups to  provide entertainment on base to military people, civilian employees, or family members does not  AFI35-105  23 JUNE 2017 11 constitute an endorsement.  Promotion of (or appearing to  involve the promotion  of) the group's  objectives  through  handouts,  speeches,  program  content,  or  other  forms  of promotion  connected  with  the  entertainment  (including  the  period  before  and  after  the entertainment)  is  prohibited.  Commanders  must  ensure  participation  is  in  good  taste, appropriate  in  scope  and  type,  and  in  keeping  with  the  dignity  of  the  Air  Force.  (T-1). Participation  should  be  coordinated  with  other  military  services  and  Air  Force  units  if they are involved. 3.2.1.4.  Wear  of  Uniform.  Air  Force  members  may  appear  in  uniform  at  local community-wide,  civic-sponsored  events  only  when  the  approving  commander  believes participation  is  appropriate  and  in  good  taste;  the  individuals  volunteer  for  the assignment;  there  is  no  interference  with  military  duties  or  operations;  participation involves no additional cost to the government; and the event meets the basic participation criteria in paragraph 3.2.2. This applies to the active-duty and Reserve components. For more information on the wear of uniforms for public appearances reference AFI 36-2903, Dress and Personal Appearance of Air Force Personnel, and consult with the installation legal office and MAJCOM/ PA. 3.2.1.4.1.  Uniform  wear  restrictions  due  to  force  protection  considerations  must  be adhered to in a combatant commander’s area of operations. (T-1) 3.2.2.  Participation  Criteria.  To  ensure  every  planned  event  complies  with  public  law  and DOD policy, at least one condition in each of the following participation criteria categories must be met: Program, Sponsor, Support, and Site. (T-1). 3.2.2.1.  Participation Criteria—Program. 3.2.2.1.1.  Approved: 3.2.2.1.1.1.  Directed by Public Law, executive order, or the Secretary of Defense. 3.2.2.1.1.2.  Official federal government or civil ceremonies or functions. 3.2.2.1.1.3.  Events or occasions of general interest or benefit to a local, regional, or national community that are open to the general public. Closed events may be considered of common interest and mutual benefit to the community if invitations are extended to a broad cross-section of a diverse community. 3.2.2.1.1.4.  In direct support of Air Force recruiting programs. 3.2.2.1.1.5.  Patriotic  in  nature  for  the  celebration  of  an  official  local,  state, regional, or national holiday. 3.2.2.1.1.6.  Supporting  DOD-approved  united,  federated,  or  joint  fundraising campaign, such as the Combined Federal Campaign (CFC). (T-0) 3.2.2.1.1.7.  Fundraising Events. In general the Air Force will not provide support to  fundraising  events.  Limited  logistical  Air  Force  support  of  local  fundraising programs  may  be  provided  when  the  program  is  local  in  nature  and  of community-wide  interest  and  benefit.  PA  must  ensure  support  is  incidental  in nature.  (T-1).  Care  should  be  given  to  ensure  support  does  not  give  preferential treatment  to  a  single  event  or  cause,  even  when  the  prospective  recipient(s)  is covered  by  the  CFC.  Refer  to  DOD  5500.07-R,  Joint  Ethics  Regulations,  for  12 AFI35-105  23 JUNE 2017 additional information or contact the legal office for additional guidance.

The use is not restricted by other statutes or regulations. 3.2.2.1.1.7.7.  No  admission  fee  is  charged  for  the  portion  of  the  event supported  by  the  Air  Force  beyond  what  covers  the  reasonable  costs  of sponsoring the event. 3.2.2.1.1.7.8.  A  military  band,  color  guard  or  choral  group,  or  portion  of  a group,  flyover  or  static  display  is  not  logistical  support  and  is  generally  not available  to  support  non-federal  entity  fundraising  events.

Organizations  with  a  narrow  membership  base  or  interest  (religious  or sectarian groups or organizations, ideological movements, and political organizations and campaigns) when it is  clear that support primarily benefits  of the community at large or the Air Force, as opposed to benefiting the sponsoring organization. 3.2.3.1.7.  Air  Force  bands,  performers,  and  other  units  may  perform  on  television and radio programs. The programs are on public service broadcasts, and participation does not benefit or endorse any commercial enterprise.

If the site is a private commercial or religious building, shopping mall, or non-public school,  college, or university, except  as specified in  paragraphs 3.2.5.1.5 through 3.2.5.1.7 3.3.  Funding  Requirements.  Air Force policy is  to  participate in  programs  and events  within programmed  budgets.  Participation  requiring  additional  cost  to  the  government  should  be avoided  unless  considered  in  the  best  interest  of  the  Air  Force.  Budgeted  events  fall  into  two event categories: Primary Interest--all costs incurred by the Air Force unit or units involved, and Mutual Interest--costs are shared by the Air Force and the sponsor. Scheduled training or troop movements that are viewed by the public are considered incidental to training and not a Public Affairs function. The following guidelines apply (T-1): 3.3.1.  Primary  Interest.  Primary  interest  events  can  include  those  requiring  SAF/PA  and OASD/PA approval and those that may be approved by the local wing commander. In either case, the participating unit will incur all costs. (T-1). 3.3.1.1.  Events  for  which  the  participating  unit  is  authorized  to  bear  all  costs  might include  DOD  requirements,  Air  Force  or  civic-sponsored  public  observances  of  the United  States  or  a  host  or  partner  nation,  official  ceremonies  or  functions,  or  speaking engagements. 3.3.2.  Mutual  Interest.  Events  identified  as  mutual  interest  are  carried  out  with  the  civilian sponsor. 3.3.2.1.  The  participating  unit  is  responsible  for  Air  Force  costs  of  participation  unless advised  otherwise  by  higher  authority.  Units  must  budget  for  these  costs  in  annual financial plans. (T-1). The unit's costs are those continuing costs that exist even if the Air Force did not participate. These include pay, allowances, and incidental expenses. 3.3.2.2.  The  cost  of  opportune  airlift  or  routine  flights  in  military  aircraft  for transportation  of  people  and  exhibit  materials  is  also  an  Air  Force  share  of  costs.  This only applies to the support of other military services whose participation in an event has been authorized. 3.3.2.2.1.  Civilian  sponsors  must  reimburse  the  Air  Force  for  additional  costs, including  but  not  limited  to  the  following:  travel  cost  of  military  personnel  and equipment;  per  diem  payable  under  federal  joint  travel  regulations;  cost  of  shipping exhibit  materials  when  commercial  means  are  used;  any  rental  space,  utilities,  or custodial services; and cost of shipping aviation fuel if it is not available at a military contract price at the required location. 3.3.2.3.  Also  included  are  any  additional  services  determined  necessary  by  the participating units and agreed on by the civilian sponsor. MAJCOMs may waive the per diem cost payment requirement and accept locally furnished meals and quarters but only if  they  meet  military  standards.  This  waiver  authority  may  not  be  delegated  to  a  lower authority even if such items are accepted without prior approval.  16 AFI35-105  23 JUNE 2017 3.3.2.4.  Sponsors  must  also  provide  local  area  ground  transportation,  exhibits,  space, utilities, custodial services, or any other required services.  AFI35-105  23 JUNE 2017 17 Chapter 4 USE OF AERIAL DEMONSTRATION TEAMS, PARACHUTE TEAMS, STATIC DISPLAYS AND OTHER EQUIPMENT 4.1.  On- or Off-Base Public Events  — General Guidance. The Air Force takes part in events at military and civilian locations to keep the public and military informed of U.S. preparedness, to  demonstrate  modern  weapons  systems,  to  promote  good  community  and  international relations, to support Air Force recruiting and retention efforts, and to render military honors. Air Force participation  in  any  public event  shall be in accordance  with  DODD 5410.18 and DODI 5410.19. Authority to approve requests from organizations requesting off-base aviation support has been delegated by the OASD/PA to the military services. Per delegation from the Secretary of the Air Force memorandum “Exception-to-Policy Flyover Approval Request”, dated 10 Aug 1998, the approval authority for Air Force participation in such events is SAF/PA in coordination with  AF/A3O (T-1). Safety is  the primary consideration. All  pertinent  safety  regulations  of the Department  of Defense,  Department  of the Air Force, and the  Federal  Aviation  Administration (FAA) are strictly enforced. Air Force participation at events requires approval for eligibility and level of support (SAF/PAY) and operational participation approval (AF/A3O). While the public affairs  community  approves  the  appropriateness  of  an  event  for  Air  Force  participation,  the operations  community  concurs  on  the  operational  issues  impacting  the  feasibility  and  safety  of participation. 4.1.1.  SAF/PAY  determines  eligibility  and  is  the  approval  authority  for  all  Air  Force aviation  public  event  requests  including  those  in  support  of  one  of  the  five  DOD  approved patriotic holidays, aviation-related events and non-aviation-related events. (T-1) 4.1.2.  AF/A3O and SAF/AQ must approve the use of any aircraft or equipment undergoing testing  in  a  research  and  development  (R&D)  program.  Submit  these  requests,  through  the MAJCOM/A3O to AF/A3O and SAF/AQ, at least 60 days before the event date. (T-1) 4.1.3.  All events scheduled for, or that may attract, national or international media coverage are coordinated with SAF/PA. Send requests, through PA channels, to SAF/PAY at least 15 days before the event date or as soon as the event is known. (T-1) 4.1.4.  Flyovers of public events in support of community engagement activities are flown as a part of an approved training mission within allotted flying hours. (T-0) 4.2.  On-Base  Public  Events.  Military  units  hosting  one  or  more  aerial  events  on  a  military installation, when the event is open to the public, must submit requests via the DD Form 2535, Request for Military Aerial Support. (T-0). 4.2.1.  Use of Military Aircraft for Off-Base Public Events.  Requests for off-base flyovers are  considered  by  SAF/PAY  only  for  aviation-oriented  events  (i.e.,  air  shows,  airport anniversaries  or  dedications)  or  for  patriotic  observances  held  in  conjunction  with  formal observances, open to the public, honoring Armed Forces Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day,  Prisoner  Of  War/Missing  in  Action  (POW/MIA)  Recognition  Day  or  Veterans  Day, when  held  within  seven  days  before  or  after  the  national  day  of  observance  (T-1). Exceptions-to-policy for events other than those listed above are considered by SAF/PAY on a case-by-case basis after determining appropriateness and benefit of Air Force participation. Note: Sporting events require SAF/PAY exception-to-policy approval regardless of the date  18 AFI35-105  23 JUNE 2017 (T-0).  For  example,  a  professional  or  local  baseball  game  on  July  4  must  be  approved  by SAF/PAY. 4.2.1.1.  All requests received for use of military aircraft at a location in North America are  completed  via  the  DD  Form  2535  through  the  online  Aerial  Events  website: www.airshows.hq.af.mil.  The requesting organization of the event will be the point of contact on the request. If a request is received with an Air Force member as the point of contact,  it  will  be  denied  until  the  proper  civilian  contact  is  provided  to  SAF/PAY. Requestors  will  ensure  a  hard  copy  of  the  request  is  printed;  required  signatures  are obtained, and then forwarded to SAF/PAY within required time constraints (45 days but no less than 15 days). Be cautious not to give the impression of approval before the event is  officially  approved  by  higher  headquarters.  Air  Force  members  will  not  solicit  an organization to provide flyovers or other support. Upon their request, providing a list of available  assets  to  the  event  organizer  is  acceptable.  Note:  Requests  are  not  processed until all required signatures are obtained, including the event site certifier and FAA, and are received by SAF/PAY. 4.2.2.  Overseas  Requests.  For  overseas  units,  authority  for  aircraft  participation  at  civilian locations is delegated to the appropriate combatant commander. If applicable, concurrence of MAJCOM  with  operational  control  of  assets  requested  is  necessary.  Overseas  requests  for CONUS-based  assets to  specifically deploy in  support of an  air show or  other public event (i.e., Paris Air Show or Royal  International Air Tattoo, etc.) should be addressed to  AF/A3 and the COCOM at least 60 days before the event. 4.2.3.  For each event, the flyover will consist of not more than four tactical/rotary aircraft (of the same type) or one heavy/bomber making one pass (T-1). 4.2.4.  Aerial Events Message. An aerial events message is distributed annually to specify the types of exception-to-policy events that are and are not eligible for support by the Air Force, and pre-determine the proper level of support. This message also annotates further restricting of policy due to current budgetary and OASD/PA policies. It is disseminated from AF/A3O and SAF/PAY at the beginning of the calendar year, or as needed. 4.3.  Thunderbirds.  Demonstrations  by the  USAF  Aerial  Demonstration  Squadron, Thunderbirds,  are  flown  only  over  airports,  large  bodies  of  water,  or  unpopulated  areas.  Requests for performances are due to SAF/PAY no later than July 1 each year to be considered for air shows two years in advance (T-1). 4.3.1.  Performances  on  Air  Force  Bases.  Aerial  demonstrations  at  Air  Force  bases  are requested by the host wing public affairs offices through the MAJCOM to SAF/PAY by July 1  (T-1).  The  Thunderbirds  schedule  two  years  in  advance.  Priority  is  given  to  bases  that request  two-day  shows.  Requests  for  the  Navy’s  Blue  Angels  and  the  Army’s  Golden Knights  are  submitted  to  the  U.S.  Navy  and  U.S.  Army  Public  Affairs  offices  indicated  on page  4  of  the  DD  Form  2535.  Requests  for  the  Canadian  Snowbirds  are  submitted  to  the Canadian Air Division Special Events office; for more information and a copy of the request form,  visit  the  team’s  website:  http://www.rcaf-arc.forces.gc.ca/en/snowbirds/index.page or call (204) 833-2500 ext. 5228. 4.3.2.  Performances  on  Other-Than-Air-Force  Military  Installations  or  Civilian  Venues. Requests  for  Thunderbirds  performances  are  submitted  to  SAF/PAY  for  review  and  AFI35-105  23 JUNE 2017 19 submission  to  the  Thunderbirds  schedulers  by  July  1.  The  individual  or  agency  sponsoring the event must submit the completed DD Form 2535 directly to SAF/PAY. PA offices may assist  sponsors  with  the  DD  Form  2535  but  will  not  submit  the  request  for  the  sponsor  to avoid perception that the Air Force will approve the request. (T-1). The Chief of Staff of the Air Force is the approval authority for the Thunderbirds aerial demonstration team schedule. 4.3.3.  Cancellations. If a PA office is notified of a cancellation of an off-base performance, encourage the sponsor to notify the Thunderbirds immediately if they have not already done so.  A  military  unit  canceling  a  performance  by  the  Thunderbirds  at  its  installation  must immediately send an e-mail message listing the date the performance was scheduled, place, reason  for  cancellation,  and  person  canceling  the  performance  (with  phone  number  and affiliation,  if  possible,  for  a  civilian  site),  through  PA  channels  with  a  courtesy  copy  to SAF/PAY. (T-1). 4.3.4.  All activities undertaken by the Thunderbirds that are likely to result in national media exposure  (i.e.  videos,  civic  leader/media  flights,  and  television  appearances)  are  to  be reported  to  SAF/PAY  via  ACC/PA.  Photo  shoots  over  national  landmarks  such  as  Mount Rushmore, the Statue of Liberty, etc., are to be coordinated with SAF/PAY via ACC/PA at least 10 days in advance. (T-1) 4.3.5.  All open houses and airshows eligible for Thunderbirds support are posted for internal use to the Air Force Aerial Events website: www.airshows.pa.hq.af.mil. 4.4.  Foreign  Demonstration  Teams.  Performances  by  government-sponsored foreign demonstration  teams  at  Air  Force  installations  can  enhance  international  goodwill.  Questions regarding performances by foreign teams in the United States may be addressed to AF/A3. 4.5.  Parachute Demonstrations.  Parachute demonstrations are restricted to appropriate events over airports, or areas of land where adequate crowd control can be assured. 4.5.1.  Requests for off-base parachute demonstrations at locations other than those specified receive approval as an exception-to-policy. Participation is usually limited to three days for any one event. 4.5.2.  Participation  by  official  parachute  teams,  parachute  sports  clubs,  or  qualified individuals  in  competitive  parachute  meets  sanctioned  by  the  United  States  Parachute Association (USPA) may be authorized provided such competitions are not conducted with a public  event  such  as  a  fair,  exposition,  or  similar  event.  Under  the  above  criteria,  an insurance bond is not required for participants in USPA events. 4.6.  Aircraft Static Displays. 4.6.1.  On-Base Public Events. 4.6.1.1.  Small  Public  Events.  The  installation  commander  is  the  approval  authority  for static  displays  for  events  such  as  base  tours  and  will  follow  all  operational  required approvals for aircraft not in the current inventory, see AFI 11-209. (T-2). 4.6.1.2.  Large Public Events. MAJCOM/A3 (may be delegated to lower echelon in A3) may  approve  on-base  static  displays  for  assigned  operational  resources,  not  in conjunction  with  a retirement or change of  command ceremony, for large public events such as open houses.  20 AFI35-105  23 JUNE 2017 4.6.1.3.  Civilian Aircraft. MAJCOM/A3 (may be delegated to lower echelon in A3)  may approve static displays of civilian aircraft on their respective base. Civilian participation should be at no additional cost to the U.S. Government. See AFI 34-108 and AFI 34-101, Air  Force  Morale,  Welfare,  and  Recreation  (MWR)  Programs  and  Use  Eligibility,  for guidance. 4.6.1.4.  Static displays do not require FAA approval on the DD Form 2535. 4.6.1.5.  Static displays will have at least one qualified crewmember available to answer questions  from  spectators  and  help  to  ensure  security.  In  addition,  placards  placed  near the aircraft describing the specifications and missions is encouraged (T-0). 4.6.1.6.  Static  displays  used  in  conjunction  with  retirement  or  change  of  command ceremonies consist only of aircraft assigned to the base where the ceremony is occurring. For complete guidance on retirements and changes of command, refer to AFI 11-209. 4.6.2.  Off-Base Public Events. 4.6.2.1.

Static displays will have at least one qualified crewmember available to answer questions  from  spectators  and  help  to  ensure  security.  In  addition,  placards  placed  near the aircraft describing the specifications and missions are encouraged (T-0). 4.6.2.3.  All  requests  are  required  to  be  entered  on  the  Aerial  Events  website: www.airshows.hq.af.mil. Static displays do not require FAA approval on the DD Form 2535. 4.7.  Military  Flyovers.  A  flyover,  whether  on-base  or  off-base,  is  a  straight  and  level  flight, limited to  one pass  by no more than four aircraft of the same  general  type (i.e., tactical,  rotary wing,)  or  one  heavy/bomber  from  the  same  military  service  over  a  predetermined  point  on  the ground at a specific time, and not involving aerobatics or demonstrations. A flyover of more than four  aircraft,  or  of  multiple  types  of  aircraft,  or  of  aircraft  representing  more  than  one  military service,  with  elements involving  precision  maneuvers  or demonstrations, constitutes an aerial review. Flyovers at memorial or funeral services in honor of rated and/or designated active-duty aviation personnel are not community engagement activities. In those cases, Mortuary Affairs  and AF/A3O shall determine applicability  of  a flyover.  (T-1). Any  situational  OASD/PA  and  SAF/PA  guidance  takes  precedence  over  this  AFI  (i.e. sequestration limitations, budgetary issues, Annual Aerial Events Message, etc.). trail  formation  and  not in 4.7.1.  Approval  Process.  SAF/PAY  is  responsible  for  and  tasked  with  ensuring  that airshows,  flyovers,  Air  Force  parachute  team  (AFPT)  demonstrations,  static  displays,  and non-aviation events that desire Air Force aviation participation are appropriate events for Air Force  support.  Unified  combatant  commanders,  the  Under  Secretary  of  Defense  for  Policy, and  other  OSD  officials  also  have  roles  in  specific  cases  to  deem  an  event  eligible  or ineligible  for  military  participation.  Event  sponsors  are  required  to  accomplish  a  DD  Form 2535.  Once  the  completed  DD  Form  2535  is  reviewed  by  SAF/PAY  and  the  event  is  AFI35-105  23 JUNE 2017 21 determined eligible for Air Force participation, the event is published on the Air Force Aerial Events  website  (www.airshows.pa.hq.af.mil)  for  Air  Force  flying  units  and  PA  offices  to review and support. Complete request procedures, additional information, current  guidance, and  internal  policies  and  regulations  can  be  obtained  from  the  Air  Force  Aerial  Events website. 4.7.2.  Recruiting. Public Affairs offices will work with the local recruiters to ensure they are offered the opportunity to have booth space at events where there is an Air Force flyover, per DD form 2535. (T-0) 4.7.2.1.  Units that volunteer to support an event must indicate their intent on the website. (T-1). Support must then be approved by the respective MAJCOM/A3 (may be delegated to lower echelon in A3). Sponsors of events may contact a unit to solicit participation in their particular event. Units will not rely on the sponsor to notify SAF/PAY. 4.7.3.  USAFA. All definitions and policies regarding flyovers and aerial reviews apply to the USAFA.  Examples  of  approved  Academy  events  include  graduation  ceremonies,  football games,  parades,  and  other  events  with  a  patriotic/military  theme.  USAFA  requests appropriate Air Force aviation participation through the Air Force Aerial Events website and is  limited  to  one  non-organic  flyover  per  event,  in  addition  to  local  capabilities demonstrations (i.e. parachute, gliders, etc.) 4.7.3.1.  For  each  event,  the  flyover  will  consist  of  not  more  than  four  tactical/rotary aircraft (of the same type) or one heavy/bomber making one pass. (T-1) 4.7.3.2.  Additional information regarding support to USAFA events can be found in the Annual Aerial Events Message published by AF/A3O. 4.7.4.  Off-Base Public Events. Event eligibility determination is provided by SAF/PAY. Air Force evaluation of aviation support for off-base events is based on the theme and purpose of the  event,  the  sponsoring  organization,  anticipated  audience,  assets  requested,  and  the benefits of participation to the Air Force. 4.7.4.1.  Single  flyovers.  Authorized  flyovers  include  no  more  than  four  tactical  aircraft or  one  heavy/bomber  of  the  same  type  making  one  pass  only,  in  support  of  aviation-related  events,  or  one  of  the  five  DOD  approved  patriotic  holidays:  Armed  Forces  Day (third Saturday in May), Memorial Day (last Monday in May), Independence Day (July 4), POW/MIA Recognition Day (3rd Friday in September), and Veterans Day (November 11). Flyovers must occur within seven days before or after the national day of observance for  the  patriotic  holiday  and  must  directly  support  the  holiday  commemoration.  (T-0). SAF/PAY  is  the  approving  authority  for  all  patriotic  holiday  events,  including  sporting events that fall within the 15-day window. 4.7.4.2.  Multiple passes. Multiple passes by the same formation at any off-base event are not  authorized.  Send  request  for  waiver  to  AF/A3O.    Units  will  submit  these  requests, through MAJCOM/A3 (may be delegated to  lower echelon  in  A3) to  AF/A3O (copy to SAF/PAY), at least 15 days before the event date. (T-1). 4.7.4.3.  SAF/PAY  coordinates  all  eligible  events  with  AF/A3O  to  determine  the  extent of  authorized  operational  participation,  which  is  outlined  in  the  Annual  Aerial  Events Message.  22 AFI35-105  23 JUNE 2017 4.7.5.  Requests  for  Missing-Man  Formation.  The  missing-man  formation  is  authorized  for use  at  ceremonies  commemorating  Memorial  Day,  POW/MIA  Recognition  Day,  Veterans Day, and at other suitable events when the theme is solemn in nature and when the event is not held in conjunction with another event (e.g. sporting events or air shows). The missing-man  formation  is  not  flown  at  CONUS  public  events  without  the  approval  of  AF/A3O  in coordination with SAF/PAY. (T-0) 4.7.5.1.  For  OCONUS  commands,  U.S.  military  support  for  Memorial  Day  events  at U.S. military cemeteries overseas is a key community engagement activity. All wings are encouraged to support these requests to the maximum extent possible. 4.7.5.2.  While  determination  of  event  eligibility  rests  with  the  unified  or  combatant commander,  approval  for  missing-man  flyovers  at  Memorial  Day  events  at  U.S. cemeteries overseas is delegated to the supporting MAJCOM. 4.7.6.  Aerial Review. A flyover of more than four aircraft, or of multiple types of aircraft, or of aircraft representing more than one military service, with elements in trail formation and not  involving  precision  maneuvers  or  demonstrations  constitutes  an  aerial  review.  A  single element involving four or less aircraft of different airframes but of the same general type (i.e. two F-16s and two F-22s) is not considered an aerial review. However, this latter formation should  be  undertaken  only  with  applicable  consideration  given  to  safety,  compatible  flying characteristics, and the overall theme of the event that is being supported. Aerial reviews at airshows are exempt.  (T-0). 4.7.6.1.  Aerial reviews are reserved only for the most meaningful occasions and are not scheduled  or  performed  at  CONUS  events  without  initial  review  and  approval  by SAF/PAY  and  AF/A3O  (Combatant  Command  review  and  approval  for  OCONUS events), and with final approval granted by OASD/PA. Units will submit these requests, through MAJCOM/ PA leadership, to SAF/PAY (information to AF/A3O) 45 days before the event date. (T-0). 4.7.6.2.  Multi-Service  or  multi-nation  aerial  reviews  on-  or  off-base  may  require additional  approval.  Refer  to  AFI  11-209  for  specific  guidance.  Units  will  submit  these requests,  through  MAJCOM/  PA,  to  SAF/PAY  (also  send  information  to  AF/A3O)  at least 45 days before the event date. (T-1). 4.7.6.3.  As  distinctly  diverse  assets,  SAF/PAY  and  AF/A3O  will  approve  the combination of a parachute jump and flyover or a flyover and aircraft demonstration (not to exceed a total of four elements) at off-base public events. Use of such aviation assets is reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Approval is based on the supportive justification as to the  significance  of  the  event  and  the  ability  to  provide  such  resources  at  no  additional costs to the government. 4.7.6.4.  USAFA  demonstrations  at  home  football  games,  on-base  parades,  graduation and  other  major  on-base  patriotic  events  using  USAFA-owned  assets  are  exempt  from needing a waiver. USAFA events using USAF-owned assets in addition to non USAFA-owned assets as such events, and for flyovers and aerial reviews, are also exempt. 4.7.7.  Aircraft  Demonstrations.  Aerial  demonstration  is  a  generic  phrase  that  includes virtually  every  type  of  aerial  participation  in  public  or  military  events  (except  for  aerial review  and  flyover)  to  include  aerobatics,  aircraft  capabilities  demonstrations,  assault  AFI35-105  23 JUNE 2017 23 landing/takeoffs,  aircraft  weapons  or  tactics  demonstrations,  Air  Force  Vintage  Aircraft Programs  (i.e. USAF Heritage Flight  Program  operated by Air Combat Command), airdrop demonstrations  of  personnel  or  equipment,  and  Combat  Search  and  Rescue  (CSAR) demonstrations.  It  is  used  interchangeably  with  the  phrase  “aircraft  demonstration.” MAJCOMs  may  approve  demonstrations  by  their  assigned  operational  assets  on  their command  bases.  MAJCOM-to-MAJCOM  requests  for  these  aerial  events  are  approved  by the  MAJCOM/A3  (may  be  delegated  to  lower  echelon  in  A3)  owning  the  requested  assets. Notification to AF/A3O and SAF/PAY through their respective channels will occur 45 days prior to the event. 4.7.8.  Memorial  or  Funeral  Ceremony  –  Aerial  Event.  All  requirements  are  validated  with Mortuary  Affairs.  Refer  to  AFI  34-501,  Mortuary  Affairs  Program,  and  AFI  11-209  for guidance. 4.7.9.  Retirement and Change of Command Ceremonies – Aerial Event. Refer to AFI 11-209 for guidance. 4.8.  Jump Platform. 4.8.1.  On Base. 4.8.1.1.  MAJCOM/A3O  may  approve  use  of  its  assigned  operational  assets  on  their command bases. For notification requirements, refer to paragraph 4.5. 4.8.1.2.  MAJCOM-to-MAJCOM  requests  for  a  jump  platform  are  approved  by  the MAJCOM owning the requested assets. 4.8.1.3.  If  the  request  is  for  an  Air  Mobility  Command  (AMC)  asset,  units  will  submit requirements to AMC/A3O at least 45 days before the event date for consideration at the monthly Joint Airborne and Air Transportability Training (JA/ATT) planning conference. (T-2). 4.8.2.  Off Base. 4.8.2.1.  When a military unit is making the initial request, submit these requests, through PA  channels,  to  SAF/PAY  (with  a  copy  to  AF/A3O)  at  least  45  days  before  the  event date.  SAF/PAY  coordinates  all  approved  events  with  AF/A3O  to  determine  extent  of operational participation authorized. (T-1) 4.8.2.2.  If the request is for an AMC asset, units will submit requirements to AMC/A3O at  least  60  days  before  event  date  for  approval  or  disapproval  at  the  monthly  JA/ATT planning conference. (T-2). 4.8.2.3.  For additional guidance, reference the Annual Aerial Events Message. 4.9.  Civilian  Aerial  Demonstrations  On  Base.  Awareness of aviation heritage is the primary objective  when  scheduling  civilian  aerial  demonstrations  and  performances  during  on-base events.  While  it  is  the  intent  of  HQ  USAF  that  DOD  aerial  demonstration  teams  normally perform  aerobatics  at  or  over  Air  Force  installations,  qualified  civilian  performers  may  be permitted  to  provide  aerial  demonstrations,  flyovers,  and  static  displays  to  supplement  or augment  DOD  team  performances.  Commanders  must  select  civilian  organizations  whose aircraft  are  of  historic  military  significance  and  whose  performances  clearly  reinforce  and  24 AFI35-105  23 JUNE 2017 promote a better understanding of the Air Force. (T-1). See AFI 10-1004, Conducting Air Force Open Houses, for additional guidance. 4.10.  Supporting Special Events.  Requests for non-aviation related military support of public programs  should  be  addressed  to  the  nearest  military  installation,  using  the  DD  Form  2536, Request  for  Armed  Forces  Participation  in  Public  Events  (Non-Aviation).  Decision  criteria should  include  the  nature  of  the  program,  sponsor,  site,  and  support.  Wing  commanders  may authorize local program support without further authorization. The DD Form 2536 is designed to aid  civilian  sponsors  and  provide  required  information  for  approval  authority.  When  possible, local PA offices should provide the sponsor with the form and assist the sponsor in filling out the form  completely;  however,  they  should  not  be  listed  as  the  point  of  contact.  PA  should  also contact  local  recruiters  if  appropriate  (T-1).  Additional  consideration  should  be  given  to integrating  military  assets  into  key  civilian  events  and  ensuring  proper  Air  Force  message placement in all public events. 4.10.1.  All  requests  for  Air  Force  support  within  the  National  Capital  Region  are  sent  to SAF/PAY using the DD Form 2536 at least 60 days before the event date or as soon as the event is known; SAF/PAY coordinates with OASD/PA as appropriate. (T-0) 4.10.2.  When  OASD  or  HQ  USAF  receives  direct  requests  from  civilian  sponsors, SAF/PAY  will  coordinate  with  the  respective  MAJCOM/PA  to  appoint  a  project  officer  at the base closest to the requester to plan all Air Force participation at that approved event (i.e., White  House  events,  Armed  Forces  Day,  Veterans  Day,  national  sporting  events).  The project  officer  should  establish  initial  contact  with  the  sponsor  as  soon  as  possible  and maintain  close  liaison  to  assure  the  sponsor  that  the  Air  Force  is  going  to  provide  the appropriate  level  of  assistance  and  participation.  Project  officers  are  authorized  direct communication  with  participating  commands  and  military  services.  Project  officers  will provide SAF/PAY a report of all planned participation at least 15 days before the event and prepare a brief after-action report within 30 days after the event. (T-1). 4.10.3.  MAJCOMs  must  ensure  all  events  scheduled  for  or  that  may  attract  national  or international media coverage are sent to SAF/PAY at least 30 days before the event date or as soon as the event is known. (T-1). 4.10.4.  Exceptions-to-policy  are  kept  to  a  minimum.  Unit  commanders  must  approve  any requests  for  exceptions  and  ensure  MAJCOM/A3O  (for  aviation  assets)  and  PA  have concurred as appropriate prior to submission to SAF/PAY. (T-1).  AFI35-105  23 JUNE 2017 25 Chapter 5 INTERAGENCY PROGRAMS 5.1.  Air Force Participation in Interagency Programs.  Occasionally, the Air Force takes part in and supports interagency exhibits, programs and training such as approved trade shows, Joint Interagency  Task  Force  programs,  and  interagency  wildland  fire  management  programs (ANG/AFRC). Each Air Force component of a combatant or specified command is guided by the policy on interagency programs  issued by that  command. However, the  policy stated below on programming,  preparing  budget  estimates,  and  financing  Air  Force  participation  in  interagency programs applies to all Air Force activities. 5.1.1.  Coordination. The Air Force must work through, and obtain approval from, OASD/PA on  all  interagency  programs.  In  supporting  such  programs,  the  Air  Force  objectives  are  to strengthen its community engagement program and provide Public Affairs support to all Air Force activities worldwide. (T-0) 5.1.2.  The  Air  Force  component  of  the  combatant  or  specified  command  must  forward  a request to take part in or to support an interagency action through PA channels to SAF/PAY for determination and processing through OASD/PA. (T-0).  26 AFI35-105  23 JUNE 2017 Chapter 6 SPEECHES, PUBLIC APPEARANCES, MESSAGES AND OFFICIAL FUNCTIONS 6.1.  Acceptance  Criteria.  Official  public  appearances  and  speeches  by  Air  Force  personnel, military  or  civilian,  constitute  essential  parts  of  the  Air  Force  program  to  keep  the  public informed. Individual members of the Air Force at all levels, but particularly general officers and other  key  personnel,  should  make  every  effort  to  fill  requests  unless  overriding  or  previous official commitment precludes acceptance. Apply the following criteria: 6.1.1.  Participation does not interfere with assigned duties. 6.1.2.  Remarks  are  confined  to  discussion  of  subjects  within  the  Air  Force  and  speaker’s purview. 6.1.3.  Views  expressed  are  nonpartisan,  consistent  with  AFI  51-902,  Political  Activities  by Members  of  the  U.S.  Air  Force  (uniformed  military  personnel),  and  The  Hatch  Act (civilians). (T-0) 6.1.4.  Views  expressed  during  an  official  speaking  engagement,  whether  the  event  is sponsored by a Federal or non-Federal entity, must reflect U.S. Government policy. 6.1.5.  Participation does not imply Air Force sponsorship or agreement with the statements of others that may be partisan in nature or contrary to national policy. 6.1.6.  Participation does not violate DOD 5500.07-R. 6.2.  Security and Policy Review.  Speakers must have their speeches reviewed for security and policy  issues  at  the  appropriate  level.  (T-1).  See  AFI  35-102,  Security  and  Policy  Review,  for complete information. 6.3.  Payment and Honoraria.  Payment or honoraria cannot be accepted for making an official on-  or  off-duty  public  appearance  or  speech  done  as  part  of  official  duties  (T-0).  Consult  the installation Staff Judge Advocate (SJA) for more information. Refer to DOD 5500.07-R. 6.3.1.  Travel Expenses. Funded TDY is authorized to support approved events; however, in some  cases,  official  travel  expenses  can  be  paid  by  the  organization  requesting  a  speaker. Coordinate with the SJA. 6.3.2.  Federal  government  employees  shall  not  accept  any  gift  of  value  given  to  them because of their government position or by a "prohibited source."  (T-0). Gifts valued under $20  may  be  accepted  under  the  "de  minimus"  rule,  one  of  many  gift  exceptions  for  DOD personnel.  If  the  gift  is  valued  at  more  than  $20  or  results  in  gifts  totaling  more  than  $50 received from the same source in a calendar year, do not reject it outright. Contact the local SJA office to determine if the gift can be accepted. 6.4.  U.S. Air Force Representation at Events in the National Capital Region and New York City.  SAF/PA  has  an  established  process  to  vet,  advise,  and  approve  community  engagements and  speaking  opportunities  in  the  NCR  and  New  York  City.  SAF/PAY  advises  whether  or  not attendance  is  desirable,  optional,  or  inadvisable  and  assists  in  ensuring  legal  requirements  are met.    Members  must  contact  SAF/PAY  upon  receipt  of  the  invitation  in  these  areas.  (T-1). SAF/PAO maintains operational authority for media activities in NYC.  AFI35-105  23 JUNE 2017 27 6.4.1.  Personal Responsibilities. 6.4.1.1.  Air  Force  military  members  or  civilians  invited  to  speak  or  appear  at  public events in the NCR or in New York City will notify their respective Public Affairs offices immediately  upon  receipt.    The  respective  PA  office  will  then  notify  the  owning MAJCOM/PA and request guidance from SAF/PAON. The invited member will indicate desire to accept or decline the invitation. 6.4.2.  Unit Responsibilities. 6.4.2.1.  Units  based  in  the  NCR/Washington  Metropolitan  Area  do  not  need  to coordinate local community engagement programs with SAF/PA unless senior Air Force leaders  are  involved.  Exceptions  are  events  sponsored  by,  or  in  honor  of,  foreign nationals.  Invitations  in  honor  of  foreign  dignitaries  should  be  reported  to  SAF/IA, according to AFI 65-603, Official Representation Funds. 6.4.2.2.  Air Force Protocol, AF/CVAP, provides advice on state and official functions. 6.5.  Inviting Distinguished Visitors.  Air Force units may invite distinguished visitors to attend appropriate functions. 6.5.1.  Government Officials. SAF/PAY should be notified if invitations are sent to members of the Supreme Court, Cabinet Secretaries, and Principal Deputies to Cabinet Secretaries. 6.5.1.1.  Commands  must  favorably  endorse  invitations  for  them  to  receive  approval  at HQ Air Force level. 6.5.1.2.  Air  University  and  USAFA.  Correspond  directly  with  Cabinet  Officers  and Principal  Deputies  to  Cabinet  Officers  to  speak  or  appear  at  academic  functions.    On acceptance of such an invitation, Air University and/or USAFA/PA will notify SAF/PAY immediately. (T-1). 6.5.1.3.  President, Vice President and Members of Congress. Invitations to the President of the United States, Vice President, and members of the Congress should be processed according to AFI 90-401, Air Force Relations with Congress. (T-1). 6.5.2.  Military  Officials.  Invitations  may  be  made  directly  by  or  through  commanders  of MAJCOMs,  DRU’s  or  FOAs  to  senior  officials  up  to,  and  including,  the  Chairman;  Joint Chiefs of Staff; the Secretary or Chief of Staff of the Army; the Secretary of the Navy or the Chief  of  Naval  Operations;  the  Secretary  or  Chief  of  Staff  of  the  Air  Force;  or  the Commandant, U.S. Marine Corps. When an invitation from an Air Force unit is accepted by any of the officials listed above, the hosting PA will notify SAF/PAY immediately.  (T-1). 6.5.3.  Foreign Nationals. SAF/IA must approve all invitations from CONUS commanders to foreign nationals to visit U.S. Air Force facilities or to take part in U.S. Air Force-sponsored functions. Contact your base level foreign disclosure office for further details. (T-1) 6.5.4.  Invitations  to  other  distinguished  visitors  are  procedural  matters  for  commands. However,  MAJCOMs  will  advise  SAF/PAY  immediately  when  the  appearance  of  a distinguished visitor at an Air Force function is considered likely to attract national attention. Note:  Invitations for citizens of national prominence to take part in or attend memorial and dedication programs are processed according to AFI 36-3108, Memorialization Program and Ceremonies.  28 AFI35-105  23 JUNE 2017 6.5.5.  Congressional Visits. Information concerning visits by members of Congress is found in AFI 90-401. 6.5.6.  Joint Civilian Orientation Conference (JCOC). This is an annual conference arranged by  OASD/PA  in  which  civilian  opinion  leaders  are  personally  invited  by  the  Secretary  of Defense. The participants attend briefings in the Pentagon and visit field installations within different combatant commands. 6.5.6.1.  These  tours  should  be  given  the  highest  priority  since  they  are  SECDEF sponsored with assistance from OASD/PA and SAF/PAY. SAF/PA will send a message to Air Force MAJCOMs annually requesting nominations. The message outlines nominee criteria  and located  at http://jcoc.osd.mil/. for  submission.  The  JCOC  website instructions is 6.5.6.2.  Nominees  must  be  influential  leaders  in  their  professions  and  in  their communities who, both personally and professionally, communicate with key audiences. Examples  include:  presidents  of  universities  and  colleges;  chief  executive  officers  and senior officials of private enterprises with regional or national reach; publishers, editors, and management officials of news media organizations; national and regional leaders of professional  groups;  minority  and  women’s  organizations;  and  rising  state  and  local elected  and  appointed  officials.  OASD/PA  makes  the  final  selections  of  attendees  from among those nominated. (T-0).  AFI35-105  23 JUNE 2017 29 Chapter 7 AIR FORCE TOURS, PROGRAMS AND OPEN HOUSES 7.1.  General  Guidelines.  The Air Force Tour Program increases awareness and understanding of the Air Force’s role in national security by inviting groups of opinion and community leaders to  witness  the  Air  Force  mission  by  visiting  Air  Force  installations.  Air  Force  units  carefully select candidates who are capable of disseminating information to various publics about the Air Force’s programs. Participants may travel on military transportation, including aircraft, to view the Air Force in action in accordance with DOD 4515.13, Air Transportation Eligibility. 7.1.1.  All tours are conducted under the same basic guidelines, and there are different types of  tours  to  include  National  Civic  Leader  Tours,  civic  leader  tours  (CLT),  community engagement tours, and base tours. 7.1.1.1.  Prior  to  planning  or  scheduling  any  community  engagement  tour  other  than  a routine  base  tour  or  local  tour  (no  travel  outside  the  local  area  and  out  and  back  in  the same day), public affairs units must complete a tour plan and forward it to the MAJCOM Public  Affairs  office  for  concurrence  and  forwarding  to  SAF/PAY  for  approval.  (T-1). For the most current tour plan template contact the appropriate MAJCOM/PA office. 7.1.2.  Hosting units will ensure that tours adhere to OASD/PA guidance that civilian visitors are not permitted to operate any item of military equipment when such operation could cause, or reasonably be perceived as causing, an increased safety risk. (T-0). This policy is designed to  ensure  visits  are  conducted  as  safely  as  possible.  This  policy  specifically  includes  any aspect of the actual operation of military vessels, aircraft, vehicles, and crew-served weapons systems.  Small  arms  weapons  firing  is  allowed  with  local  wing  commander  approval,  but host nation sensitivities involving this event should be taken into consideration at OCONUS locations. 7.1.3.  Tours  are  not  intended  to  produce  media  coverage;  however,  media  queries concerning the program or a specific tour are answered factually, completely, and in a timely manner. Hosting units will ensure tour participants are advised prior to the event that names, business affiliations, and any other information releasable under FOIA are released if queried by the media. (T-0). 7.1.4.  Working members of the press and members of the U.S. Congress and their staff are not  included  in  community  engagement  tours  since  there  are  other  programs  in  place  for these groups. Members of local and state governments may be included. (T-1) 7.1.5.  In areas where major units are collocated, the tour host will coordinate tour plans and guest lists with other Air Force Public Affairs offices in the area before extending invitations in order to maximize Air Force reach. (T-1). Local Air Force recruiting squadron commander and/or  recruiters,  AFROTC  detachments,  and  ANG  and  AFRC  sources  should  also  be contacted for suggested tour invitees. 7.2.  National Civic Leader Tours.  SAF/PAY manages the overall National Civic Leader Tour Program, and in particular, tours that are broadly focused in nature. For example, SAF/PAY may set up tour specifically targeting STEM career fields and have Air Force’s Chief Scientist as the host. SAF/PAY, working with MAJCOMs, will coordinate to assign execution responsibility for  30 AFI35-105  23 JUNE 2017 individual  tours.  Additional  themes  for  national  civic  leader  tours  may  be  proposed  at  lower echelons and submitted through MAJCOMs along with the tour plan to SAF/PAY for approval. When organizing national civic leader tours: 7.2.1.  The focus is on issues or themes that have greater local or national impact. 7.2.2.  The  target  audience  is  composed  of  stakeholders  generally  associated  with  a  major strategic issue or persons who are force multipliers in communicating Air Force messages. 7.2.3.  Limit National Civic Leader Tours to two days. 7.2.4.  SAF/PAY will identify a senior Air Force leader and PA escort(s) to accompany the tour. 7.2.5.  MAJCOMs and wings may be asked to nominate invitees. MAJCOMs may be asked to provide assistance. 7.2.6.  In  accordance  with  AFI  24-101,  Passenger  Movement,  AMC/PA  working  with SAF/PAY  will  request  and  monitor  funds  through  AMC/PA  for  all  National  Civic  Leader tours, JCOC, SAF/PA field offices, and Air Force District of Washington (AFDW) requests via the Program Objective Memorandum (POM) process. (T-1) 7.3.  Civic  Leader  Tours.  The  target  audience  is  stakeholders  connected  to  a  local  issue  or where  general  civic  education  can  be  justified.  Civic  Leader  Tours  are  more  than  one  day  and involve travel away from the local installation. 7.3.1.  Bases and units are responsible for funding their civic leader tours, to include airlift. PA offices interested in hosting a CLT should contact their MAJCOM/PA early in the fiscal year  budget  process  to  determine  the  best  funding  mechanism  based  on  MAJCOM requirements. MAJCOMs are not required to fund civic leader tours for bases. 7.3.2.  Tours are limited to two days. SAF/PAY will be the approval authority for exception to the policy authorizing a tours extending more than two days. 7.3.3.  There is no limit on the number of civic leader tours that may be performed as long as justification  is  provided  via  the  tour  plan.  Approval  is  also  contingent  upon  MAJCOM concurrence and budget availability. 7.3.4.  Participants  may  travel  on  Air  Force  aircraft  to  view  the  Air  Force  in  action  in accordance  with  information  provided  in  DOD  4515.13;  DODI  5122.08,  Use  of  DOD Transportation Assets for Public Affairs Purposes; and DODI 5410.19. Reference Table 1 in Section 8. 7.3.5.  Not all civic leader tours require airlift. Commanders should consider all alternatives in an effort to meet the communication objective(s). 7.3.5.1.  If airlift is used, MAJCOM is the approval authority. 7.3.5.2.  Airlift is flown as a funded special assignment airlift mission (SAAM) per AFI 24-101. 7.3.5.3.  If flying on Air Force aircraft, invitational travel orders should be accomplished in accordance with local procedures. A manifest of passengers will be accomplished for all flights per the originating unit’s guidelines. (T-2)  AFI35-105  23 JUNE 2017 31 7.3.6.  Tours  should  be  focused  on  and  driven  by  local  or  regional  issues.  Itinerary  is developed  to  meet  specific  objective(s)  with  measurable  result(s).  Care  will  be  taken  to  tie the MAJCOM mission to the overall Air Force mission. 7.4.  General Civic Leader Tour Guidance. 7.4.1.  For  all  tours,  specific  communication  objectives  are  developed  by  the  unit  and forwarded  for  approval  via  the  tour  plan  to  the  MAJCOM/PA  and  SAF/PAY.  Consider theme-based tours, such as environmental, small business, personnel, education, warrior care and others. (T-1) 7.4.2.  The  PA  sponsor  must  indicate  special  aircraft  configuration,  including  seating, comfort  pallets,  etc.,  with  the  appropriate  supporting  airlift  unit  scheduler  when  arranging airlift support. (T-1). 7.4.3.  All  group  lodging  reservations  are  made  through  the  base  lodging  office.

(T-3). Priority should be given to making bill payments the least cumbersome on everyone – the escorts, guests, and payees. 7.7.  Base  Tours.  Base  tours  tell  a  portion  of  the  Air  Force  story  to  visitors  and  should  be tailored to coincide with the interests of different age groups. An Operational Risk Management  AFI35-105  23 JUNE 2017 33 assessment should be done before all interactions with members of the public on base to ensure safety. 7.7.1.  Classified Information. Protecting classified information is a matter of prime concern in any tour program. 7.7.2.  Coordination.  Public  Affairs  must  have  written  procedures,  coordinated  with  base security forces, on how to handle all types of tour issues or emergencies. (T-3). 7.7.3.  Foreign Nationals.

Non-PA  sponsored  tours.  Unit  commanders  may  sponsor  visitors  into  their organization  and  onto  installations  IAW  local  base  access  procedures.  In  approving  such visits,  commanders  assume  responsibility  for  the  safety  and  security  of  visitors  to  include providing  escort/supervision  of  guests,  performing  risk  assessment  on  activities,  properly coordinating  activities  that  fall  outside  the  commanders'  immediate  span  of  control  (i.e., anything  outside  the  commander’s  organization),  and  adhering  to  the  local  installation  tour procedures. 7.8.  Base  Open  Houses.  Open  houses  provide  an  opportunity  for  citizens  to  gain  an understanding  of  Air  Force  missions  and  military  capabilities  as  well  as  the  skills  and professionalism  of  its  people.  Commanders  are  encouraged  to  execute  an  open  house  with prudent  oversight  that  balances  the  issues  of  force  protection  and  operations  tempo  with  the expected benefits of opening the base to the public. AFI 10-1004 provides full guidance for the planning and execution of Air Force open houses. 7.8.1.  Commanders  should  hold  open  houses  when  considered  in  the  best  interest  of  their overall community engagement program. 7.8.2.  Open houses should inspire patriotism and aid military recruiting efforts and not be (or convey  the  image  of)  a  fair,  carnival,  circus,  or  civilian  air  show.  Commercial  sponsorship may be authorized under AFI 34-108, Commercial Sponsorship, if appropriate to the event. 7.8.3.  Open houses should highlight the base mission and Air Force life and do not always have  to  be  an  air  show.  Commanders  may  consider  opening  dining  facilities,  dormitories, maintenance  shops,  classrooms,  flight  simulators,  and  other  unclassified  facilities  during  a non-aviation-related open house. 7.8.4.  Consider  highlighting  air,  space,  cyberspace,  sister-service  and  other  government assets at open houses, and partnering with NASA to showcase educational resources such as space missions and exploration, exhibits and astronaut appearances. 7.8.5.  A  base  open  house  is  a  major  activity.  Project  officers  should  be  senior  in  rank  and familiar with flight and maintenance activities to ensure the success of the event. 7.8.6.  Commanders  must  ensure,  due  to  extensive  PA  involvement,  that  the  Public  Affairs officer  is  not  appointed  as  overall  open  house  project  officer.  (T-1).  The  PA  office  works closely  with  the  project  officer  to  ensure  public  awareness  and  promote  attendance  at  the open house.  34 AFI35-105  23 JUNE 2017 7.8.7.  Refer  to  AFI  34-108  for  restrictions  on  commercial  sponsorship  and  the  use  of  non-appropriated funds in support of open houses.  AFI35-105  23 JUNE 2017 35 Chapter 8 PUBLIC AFFAIRS TRAVEL OTHER THAN MEDIA 8.1.  Purpose  of  Public  Affairs  (PA)  Travel.  IAW DODI 4515.13 and DODI 5122.08, public affairs transportation is defined as “Transportation of individuals, groups, or materiel undertaken as a result of a request to or an invitation from, and authorized by, an approving authority in the interest  of  adding  to  the  public  understanding  of  DOD  activities.  It  includes  transportation involving  individuals  or  cargo,  military  or  civilian,  government  or  non-government,  U.S.,  and foreign  requests.  Transportation  may  be  local  or  non-local,  point-to-point,  or  public  affairs orientation flights that are performed in a local flying area and terminate at the point of origin or in proximity to the point of origin.” Military carriers may be used to support travel of the public, American  or  foreign,  in  support  of  approved  PA  programs,  including  community  engagement programs, tours, or conferences in which a DOD component is either a sponsor or a participant; or in cases where local commanders believe it furthers their PA program to approve travel, and tours or other PA programs arranged jointly with another Federal department or agency or with a foreign  government.  Media  travel  is  addressed  in  AFI  35-104,  Media  Operations.  Travel authorized for PA purposes reflects the following considerations: 8.1.1.  Commanders will ensure PA travel shall not compete with U.S. flag commercial sea, land,  or  air  transportation  when  that  capability  exists,  is  adequate,  and  when  PA  objectives may be achieved through use of commercial transportation. (T-0). 8.1.2.  Travel or transportation for PA purposes is determined to be primarily in the interest of the DOD, the MAJCOM or the unit. 8.1.3.  Travel designed solely to increase goodwill, or serve humanitarian purposes does not meet the criteria for PA travel. 8.1.4.  A  PA  escort  is  required  to  accompany  all  Public  Affairs  travel.  For  Public  Affairs Flights  in  fighter/trainer  aircraft, Public Affairs will be planeside and present  pre-flight  and post-flight. (T-1). 8.2.  Eligibility.  Both U.S. citizens and foreign nationals are eligible for PA travel; participation in approved PA activities by non-government foreign nationals (i.e., partner nation civic leaders) is approved by the MAJCOM/CC or CV using established foreign visitor request processes with the  local  foreign  disclosure  office.  Eligibility  includes  individuals  traveling  on  invitational  or authorized  travel  in  support  of  approved  PA  activities,  including  guests  of  the  Secretary  of Defense  participating  in  the  Joint  Civilian  Orientation  Conference  (JCOC),  the  National  Civic Leader Tour program, civic leader tours, Public Affairs Flights, or tours and activities arranged jointly  with  other  Federal  government  departments  or  agencies  or  with  a  foreign  government, and  individuals  who,  because  of  their  position  and  contacts  with  various  public  organizations, can make positive contributions to public understanding of the roles and missions of the DOD. 8.3.  Terms Defined. 8.3.1.  Operational Approval Authority (OAA). Official representative authorized to approve operational use of a military carrier. The operational approval  authority is designated based on operational control (OPCON) of the air asset in use. If the OAA is the MAJCOM/CC, it applies to the MAJCOM having OPCON of the air asset.

Travel  is  local  with  respect  to  each  MAJCOM  and  Air  Force  base concerned  when  it  is  within  the  scope  of  interest  in  the  public  affairs  program  involved. Local travel may include interim stops within CONUS as long as the travel concludes at the point of origin and lasts only one day (not overnight). Local travel may be defined differently in an OCONUS area of responsibility; consult the theater PA for guidance. 8.3.4.  Non-Local Travel. Travel conducted in support of a public affairs program that affects more  than  one  military  department;  OCONUS  geographic  regions/area  of  responsibility; major  or  combatant  commands;  the  scope  of  interest  being  of  primary  concern  to  a  higher headquarters  than  the  military  headquarters  and/or  installation  requesting  the  travel.  Non-local concludes at the point of origin and lasts more than one day. 8.3.5.  Point-to-Point Travel. Travel from one location to another. Can be local or non-local. 8.3.6.  Intertheater airlift.

The Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs (ATSD/PA) must approve the use of military carriers for PA purposes with delegations of authority as outlined in DODI 5122.08.  This  authority  is  delegated  to  commanders  at  all  echelons  who  are  authorized  to grant participation approval for local travel or transportation for PA purposes wholly within the  scope  of  the  mission  and  responsibilities  of  their  respective  command  subject  to  the following conditions (T-0): 8.4.1.1.  The PA activity is not the responsibility of a higher command. 8.4.1.2.  The  public  interest  in  the  PA  activity  is  confined  primarily  to  the  mission  and vicinity of that command. 8.4.1.3.  Transportation  is  provided  for  non-government  personnel  who  are  a  part  of  an approved local PA activity that is in the primary interest of the DOD. 8.5.  Public Affairs Travel.  The purpose of PA travel is to further public understanding of Air Force  missions,  people,  and  weapons  systems  and  to  develop  Air  Force  advocates  to  carry  the Air  Force  story  to  non-traditional  as  well  as  traditional  audiences.  Authority  for  Public  Affairs travel is contained in DODD 5122.08, Use of Military Carriers for Public Affairs Purposes, and in DODI 4515.13.

Civilian Travel Procedures and Guidelines. 8.6.1.  Selecting invitees. Participants should be selected and invited as part of an overall PA strategy to increase public understanding and support of the roles and missions of the DOD, Department of the Air Force, or a local installation.  38 AFI35-105  23 JUNE 2017 8.6.2.  Installation  PAs  are  responsible  for  providing  a  comprehensive  list  of  proposed invitees  and  submitting  it  to  the  wing  commander  for  final  approval  prior  to  sending invitations. (T-1). 8.6.3.  Invitational Travel Orders and Passenger Manifests. When traveling on a local flight, there  is  no  requirement  for  invitational  travel  orders;  however,  installation  PAs  are responsible for providing required information for the manifest.

Units are responsible for funding their civic leader tours in accordance with MAJCOM/PA procedures. 8.8.1.  Fiscal  year  funds  should  be  requested  through  the  normal  MAJCOM  budgeting process.  MAJCOM/PA  will  staff  as  appropriate  within  their  command.  ANG  units  will process tour requests IAW National Guard Bureau Public Affairs Manual (PAM) 360-5. 8.9.  Airlift Requirements  . 8.9.1.  MAJCOM and base validators must submit requests to U.S. Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM)  no  later  than  60  days  prior  to  the  event,  or  30  days  if  request  includes contact information for a unit willing to volunteer to support, including owning wing support. (T-0) 8.9.2.  Requests  should  identify  any  special  requirements  such  as  airline  style  seating, comfort pallets, etc. Note: Not all aircraft can accommodate comfort pallets, and not all units can provide sufficient airline-style seating for all passengers. 8.9.3.  Although  sponsors  may  request  passenger-configured  aircraft,  the  participants experience  a  more  meaningful  view  of  Air  Force  crewmember  travel  if  they  fly  on  cargo-configured aircraft.  AFI35-105  23 JUNE 2017 39 8.9.4.  Sponsors  are  encouraged  to  request  a  refueling  mission  on  one  leg  of  the  trip.  Air refueling is  a unique Air Force operation demonstrating the capabilities of our systems  and the professionalism of our people. 8.10.  Special Considerations for Civilian, Non-Media Travel. 8.10.1.  Tactical Waiver. Touch-and-go landings, multiple practice approaches, doors open in flight, practice emergency separations, and airdrops are prohibited with passengers onboard without  a  tactical  waiver.  Tactical  waivers  must  be  requested  and  routed  through  the requesting  unit's  operations  group.  Initiating  tactical  waivers  is  the  responsibility  of  the owning wing operations group.  40 AFI35-105  23 JUNE 2017 Chapter 9 REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (NON-MEDIA) AND GENERAL INQUIRIES 9.1.  General  Guidelines.  Responding  promptly,  accurately,  and  completely  to  requests  for information  or  complaints  is  an  important  part  of  Public  Affairs.  People  often  develop  lasting impressions  of  the  Air  Force  and  the  professionalism  of  its  members  based  on  the  quality  and timeliness of replies to their queries, requests and comments. Many times correspondence is the only direct contact a person or organization has with the Air Force. 9.1.1.  Responses  should  be  written  in  a  clear,  concise  style.  Avoid  Air  Force  jargon, technical language, and acronyms. 9.1.2.  Whenever  possible,  current,  previously  cleared  information  should  be  used  in responding. However, when requests require more detail or involve sensitive subjects, proper coordination is essential. 9.1.3.  When  appropriate,  refer  requesters installation home page or to official social media channels. to  http://www.af.mil/Questions.aspx, the 9.1.4.  SAF/PAY  provides  congratulatory  letters  and  certificates  signed  by  the  SECAF  and CSAF to Boy Scout Eagle Award and Girl Scout Gold Award recipients. Requestors need to submit through at: http://www.afoutreach.af.mil/scout/. information form the online submission 9.2.  Public Inquiries.  Refer public inquiries to www.af.mil/Questions.aspx. 9.2.1.  Public Affairs is  not expected to invest excessive time and resources to research and develop materials for student research papers. Provide materials  you have readily available, politely advise requesters their request goes beyond your research capability and refer them for  further  information  to  other  appropriate  sources  of  information,  such  as  specific magazines, books, public or university libraries, industry, or other Air Force units. 9.3.  Congressional Requests and Inquiries.  Handle according to AFI 90-401. 9.4.  Regional,  State,  and  Local  Government  Officials  and  Special  Interest  Group Requests.  Special care is taken to get a fully coordinated staff response and concurrence by the commander,  and  higher  headquarters  when  appropriate,  before  answering  these  requests. Coordinate with the legislative liaison representative at the appropriate level in the commander’s action group or elsewhere on the commander’s staff. (T-3) 9.5.  Foreign  Nationals.  Public  Affairs  must  respond  directly  to  all  routine  foreign  national requests  for  unclassified  information  approved  for  public  release.  (T-1).  All  other  requests should be sent to the local AFOSI detachment and to the MAJCOM foreign disclosure offices for release determination. If release determination cannot be made at MAJCOM level, the request is sent to SAF/IA.  AFI35-105  23 JUNE 2017 41 Chapter 10 COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT, PARTICIPATION AND PROGRAMS 10.1.  General  Guidelines.  Air Force policy is to maintain close working relationships with its civilian  neighbors.  Such  a  partnership  should  include  every  area  of  Air  Force  and  civilian community life. The base and its appropriate military members, and civilian employee leadership are encouraged and expected to  take part in  community programs  and organizations. Key  civic leaders or groups should be invited to the base for informational briefings and meetings hosted by the commander and staff, as applicable. 10.1.1.  Commanders  must  ensure  that  individuals  or  groups  are  not  given  preferential treatment  that  implies  or  confers  authority  or  access  to  base  services  they  would  not  be otherwise be entitled to. (T-1). Commanders and public affairs offices should be made aware of  any  misuse  of  commander-granted  access  to  the  base,  to  include  use  of  services  meant exclusively  for  Airmen,  their  families  and  DOD  employees.  In  the  event  the  command considers  rescinding  base  access  or  privileges  afforded  to  a  key  civic  leader  or  group,  to include  honorary  commanders,  maintaining  base  security  is  a  paramount  factor  to  be considered along with the potential impact on community ties and/or local factors. 10.1.2.  Local  Organizations.  Base  personnel  should  be  encouraged local organizations compatible with their interests such as military affairs committees, community councils, etc. join to 10.1.2.1.  Public Affairs should maintain an organizational reference file to include titles and  addresses,  official  missions  and  structure,  places  and  scheduled  meetings,  and conventions. (T-3) 10.1.2.2.  The  commander  or  a  designated  representative  should  be  ex-officio  observers who  regularly  attend  meetings  of  key  civic  organizations  representing  a  broad  cross section  of  the  community,  such  as  the  Chamber  of  Commerce.  The  commander  or designated  representative  should  consult  the  servicing  legal  office  regarding  the  limits imposed by DOD 5500.07-R, para. 3-200 and 3-201, on attendance at,  and membership in non-Federal entity activities in one’s official capacity, and for ethics advice on activity limits, especially fundraisers. 10.1.2.3.  Base access for civic leaders and others is an installation commander’s decision and  should  be  worked  in  accordance  with  AFI  31-501,  Personnel  Security  Program Management, and local security forces offices. (T-1) 10.2.  General  Responsibilities.  Department  of  Defense  and  Air  Force  policies  express  the responsibility  to  maintain  an  open,  timely,  and  honest  dialogue  between  military  organizations and  community  and  opinion  leaders.  While  media  engagements  facilitate  the  more  familiar avenue  for  such  communication,  community  engagement  enables  community  leaders  to understand Air Force missions and priorities through direct  personal  contact  and dialogue  with Air  Force  personnel,  and  to  convey  community  leaders’  understanding  to  broader  community audiences  and  opinion  leaders.  Commanders  must  establish  personal  contact  with  local community leaders to increase citizen awareness of the armed forces and missions, policies, and programs  of  the  Air  Force  and  to  build  relationships  of  mutual  trust  and  benefit  between  Air Force and community leaders and their constituents. (T-1).  42 AFI35-105  23 JUNE 2017 10.3.  Air  Force  personnel  will  only  ask  community  participants  to  share  individual attitudes  or  opinions;  Air  Force  personnel  do  not  solicit  group  or  consensus recommendations  to  avoid  violating  the  Federal  Advisory  Committee  Act.  (T-1). Commanders  own  the  responsibility  to  establish  contact  with  community  leaders  and  may involve subordinate commanders and staff elements to assist in communicating about all levels of Air Force operations and personnel. 10.4.  Managing  Community  Leader  Meeting  or  Visit  Requests.  Community  leaders  may request informational meetings with Air Force commanders and visits to Air Force installations to better align community plans and services to assist Air Force operations and priorities (these are not considered a part of the tour program). Commanders should accommodate these requests as  long  as  they  do  not  interfere  with  installation  mission  execution  and  support  activities. Commanders  determine  visit  timing  and  the  level  of  Air  Force  support  provided,  while remaining cognizant of the Air Forces’ obligation to provide equal access and levels of support to similarly situated visitors. 10.4.1.  Such visitors may include volunteer representatives of community organizations and private groups, local or state officials, members of Congress or their representatives, and paid advocates  for  private,  civic,  local,  state  or  federal  interests  or  other  entities,  sometimes referred  to  as  “lobbyists.”  Groups  that  include  individuals  representing  diverse  community components  or  interests  frequently  benefit  more  broadly  from  meetings  with  Air  Force leaders than singularly aligned or purposed groups. The PA office should identify community and member affiliations within the initial visit request. Participation by former Air Force or Federal  government  personnel,  unilaterally  or  representing  a  non-DOD  entity,  does  not confer  special  access  or  expanded  discussion  scope,  unless  otherwise  authorized  by  law  or Departmental instruction. 10.4.2.  Commanders  may  outline  unit  and  installation  details  in  formal  presentations  and informal  meetings  during  discussions  with  community  groups.  AFI  35-102  covers  the requirement for review and clearance of the content of formal presentations. Air Force Public Affairs, Judge Advocate, Legislative Liaison, and mission area subject matter experts should assist  commanders  in  determining  acceptable,  relevant  information  to  satisfy  community interests  while  complying  with  information  guidelines  governing  congressional,  contractor, technical,  legal,  and  media  information,  FOIA  and  Privacy  Act  directives,  and  operations security policies and regulations, concurrent with guidance. (T-1). These examples are not all inclusive.  AFI  35-102  outlines  these  types  of  information  and  their  release  constraints  and provides  resources  governing  avenues  for  and  restrictions  on  formal,  written  requests  for public information release. 10.4.3.  Commanders should discuss the same unit and installation information across diverse community groups to avoid providing a selective benefit or conferring preferential treatment upon  any  particular  group,  whether  perceived  or  actual,  as  described  in  DOD  5500.07-R, para. 3-209. (T-0) 10.4.4.  Installation  personnel  may  only  ask  participants  in  community  leadership  programs for their personal or individual observations or recommendations. In order to avoid triggering the Federal Advisory Committee Act, these groups are not asked by the Air Force for group or consensus recommendations. (T-1)  AFI35-105  23 JUNE 2017 43 10.5.  Civic  Leader  Programs.  Commanders  are  encouraged  to  have  civic  leader/honorary commanders  programs.  These  programs  increase  the  bond  between  local  civic  leaders  and  the Air Force.  The goal of a civic leader program is to engage, educate and empower local, regional and  national  level  community  leaders  to  be  advocates  for  the  Air  Force,  Airmen  and  their families.  Civic  Leader  program  members  should  serve  as  advisors,  key  communicators  and advocates for Air Force issues, providing ideas and feedback to commanders as to how Air Force missions  can  be  best  accomplished  and  monitor  public  attitudes  toward  the  Air  Force  and  Air Force missions. 10.5.1.  Civic  Leaders  at  all  levels  serve  as  advocates  on  Air  Force  matters  and  issues.  In particular,  programs  should  focus  on  fostering  support  for  Airmen  and  their  families, recruiting talented individuals to consider the Air Force, encourage youth to serve, encourage diversity  and  outreach  to  minorities,  and  provide  Air  Force  leadership  with  insight  and perspective on high priority issues. 10.5.2.  Base-level  Civic  Leader  Programs  should  aim  to  develop  core  partners  from  the community  who  are  committed  to  the  Air  Force  and  would  make  good  candidates  to ultimately join MAJCOM and CSAF level civic leader programs. 10.5.3.  Base-level Civic Leader Programs will be managed by Wing Public Affairs staff. 10.5.4.  Under no circumstances will program participation be determined by any local civic organization  nor  will  any  local  civic  organization  assess  a  fee  to  any  civic  leader  who  is chosen by the base to participate in the base Civic Leader Program. (T-0) 10.6.  Execution of Base or MAJCOM Civic Leader Programs 10.6.1.  Generally,  neither  appropriated  nor  non-appropriated  funds  are  available  to  fund civic leader programs.  Base events  for civic leaders, such as luncheons, should  be “pay-as-you-go” or funded with official representation funds (ORF) in accordance with AFI 65-603. This  type  of  event  should  be  held  only  once  yearly  at  locations  within  the  U.S.  and  its territories. ORF may be used to host distinguished foreign nationals in accordance with AFI 65-103, Temporary Duty Orders. Consult the installation legal office before making plans. 10.6.2.  Guidelines for event participation and gifts apply to civic leader and advisory group programs.  Event  participation  cannot  violate  DOD  5500.07-R,  Joint  Ethics  Regulation. Avoid anything that could be perceived as impermissible preferential treatment, fraud, waste or abuse. (T-0) 10.6.3.  The  responsible  PA  organization  should  develop  an  operating  instruction  (OI)  in accordance with AFI 33-360 to implement the base or MAJCOM civic leader program within resources  available  at  the  installation.  The  OI  should  outline  responsibilities  of  various organizations on base (protocol, security forces, services, etc.) and complement this AFI. (T-1) 10.6.4.  When practical,  term  limits  should generally be no more than two to  three  years to enhance  the  program’s  reach  and  effectiveness  and  to  avoid  program  stagnation.  If commanders  deem  longer  terms  are  necessary,  extreme  care  should  be  taken  to  avoid  the perception  that  civic  leader  representation  is  a  closed  or  stagnant  group.  If  requested,  a current civic leader may terminate his or her term early. Should a civic leader not fulfill his  44 AFI35-105  23 JUNE 2017 or  her  responsibilities  (i.e.,  recurring  non-participation)  the  installation  commander  may terminate his or her term early. 10.6.5.  Base access for civic leaders is an installation commander’s decision and should be worked in accordance with AFI 31-501 and local security forces offices. (T-1) 10.7.  Choosing Civic Leaders.  The intent of a civic leader program is to educate and increase the knowledge and understanding  of key  civic leaders  about  the Air  Force and the installation. Civilian  participants  are  selected  from  among  non-federally  elected  or  appointed  officials, mayors, chamber of commerce-type group members, principals of local schools, Military Affairs Committee  members  and  others  who,  because  of  their  position  or  influence  in  the  community, can  positively  impact  public  support  for  the  base.  Public  Affairs  offices  should  nominate  civic leaders from a diverse cross-section of the entire community and nominees should be approved though local legal offices prior to sending to wing leadership. 10.7.1.  Civic Leaders should: 10.7.1.1.  Be a United States citizen of outstanding character, integrity and patriotism. 10.7.1.2.  Have a deep interest in military affairs. 10.7.1.3.  Be a leader in local/regional/national community affairs. 10.7.1.4.  Be in a position to provide individual perspectives to senior Air Force leaders on Air Force initiatives, issues and other matters of interest. 10.7.1.5.  Be in a position to disseminate information about the Air Force to broad cross section of the public and to other prominent citizens in his or her area. 10.7.1.6.  Be able to interpret and affect public attitude toward the Air Force. 10.7.1.7.  Be able and willing to devote a reasonable amount of time as a civic leader for the installation. 10.7.2.  Civic Leaders will not: 10.7.2.1.  Be an employee of the Federal Government. (T-0) 10.7.2.2.  Be  a  federally  elected  or  appointed  official.    Locally  elected  or  appointed officials will be considered on a case-by-case basis. (T-0) 10.7.2.3.  Be an active member of the National Guard or a member of the Ready Reserve (Selected), Individual Ready Reserve, or Standby Reserve. (T-1) 10.7.2.4.  Be  a  retired  military  member  of  any  service.  Exceptions  will  be  rare  and approved at the MAJCOM/PAC level when there is significant justification for inclusion. 10.7.2.5.  Be a paid employee of any political party. (T-0) 10.7.2.6.  Hold financial interests that conflict with their role as a civic leader. (T-0) 10.7.3.  Selection of civic leaders should target engagement of a broad cross-section of area community  leaders.  Where  possible,  a  single  representative  to  the  program  from organizations  is  desirable  (for  example,  from  a  school  or  business),  taking  into  account  the fact  that  heavily  engaged  civic  leaders  may  be  members  of  or  participate  in  multiple  local groups or organizations.  AFI35-105  23 JUNE 2017 45 10.7.4.  Nominees can work in a media-related field, but should not be a newspaper, TV, or radio reporter due to the inherent conflicts of interest that could arise if allowed unescorted access  to  the  installation  and/or  access  to  base  leadership  in  situations  not  intended  to  be public or to be publicized. Consult with MAJCOM/PA on establishing guidelines to mitigate potential conflict. 10.7.5.  Individuals employed by DOD contractors cannot be nominated, nor may nominees otherwise  occupy  a  position  that  may  create  a  perception  of  a  conflict  of  interest  between program  participation  and  their  private  interests  (for  example,  financial  interests  in  DOD contracts). The local legal office should be contacted for assistance in addressing questions in this regard. 10.8.  Think Tank and Academia  Engagement.  SAF/PAY conducts a think tank engagement program  to  connect  with  opinion  leaders  who  shape  national  and  global  policy.  This  program orchestrates  engagements  between  Air  Force  senior  leaders  and  leading  opinion  leaders  from think  tanks,  academia  and  industry  to  establish  conversations  on  key  Air  Force  issues  while receiving candid feedback. The intent of the program is to ensure Air Force senior leaders build and maintain relationships so that influential national security opinion leaders gain useful insight to better inform audiences of Air Force issues. SAF/PAY recommends general officer level wing commanders  or  Senior  Executive  Service  civilians  plan  meetings  with  think  tanks  in  the Washington, DC area when they are in town for Capitol Hill visits. Contact SAF/PAY 30 days in advance for additional details as all engagements must be worked through SAF/PAY.  (T-1) 10.8.1.  Installations  may  execute  a  think  tank  engagement  program  at  the  local  level  to facilitate  discussions  with  local  university  professors,  think  tanks,  and  opinion  leaders  on installation-specific issues. Contact SAF/PAY for additional details on setting up a program.  46 AFI35-105  23 JUNE 2017 Chapter 11 SPECIAL EVENTS, OBSERVANCES, JOINT COUNCILS, AND MUSICAL SUPPORT 11.1.  Inter-Service  Support  for  Events.  Some  community  engagement  programs  involve support  from  more  than  one  military  service.  When  more  than  one  military  service  supports  a program  sponsored  by  a  civilian  organization  and  the  magnitude  of  the  support  warrants  DOD coordination, OASD/PA requests one military department  to  nominate an officer located in  the area of the program to serve as the overall DOD support coordinator. 11.1.1.  When the Air Force is requested to nominate a DOD coordinator, SAF/PA requests the  command  with  the  installation  closest  to  the  event  nominates  a  public  affairs representative.  OASD/PA  then  designates  them  as  the  DOD  coordinator.  The  DOD coordinator  is  responsible  for  coordinating  all  military  support,  including  support  by  the ANG and AFRC. DOD coordinators are authorized direct liaison with OASD/PA. (T-0). 11.1.2.  When  the  Air  Force  provides  support  for  a  particular  event,  SAF/PA  requests appointment of a project officer, usually located within the area of the event, to represent the Air Force and assist the DOD coordinator. 11.1.3.  The  DOD  coordinator  prepares  an  after-action  report  and  sends  it  to  OASD/PA within 30 days following the event. Air Force project officers assist the DOD coordinator in preparing  the  after-action  report  by  supplying  the  Air  Force  information.  Air  Force  Project officers must ensure a copy of the report is sent to SAF/PAY. (T-0). 11.2.  Observances. 11.2.1.  Armed Forces Day. By Presidential Proclamation, Armed Forces Day is observed on the third Saturday in May. On Armed Forces Day, in keeping with the spirit of unification in the  National  Security  Act  of  1947,  as  amended,  Air  Force  units  must  not  observe  this commemoration  (or  any  other  day  of  significance  to  the  Air  Force  and  its  subordinate elements)  at  any  location  away  from  an  Air  Force  base  without  specific  authorization  of OASD/PA. (T-0). 11.2.1.1.  OASD/PA coordinates Armed  Forces Programs  at  the national  level.  SAF/PA will pass OASD/PA guidelines to the field. 11.2.1.2.  Air  Force  units  will  participate  by  extending  hospitality  to  the  public  through open  houses  or  similar  events  and  by  cooperating  with  community  and  organizational observances  of  Armed  Forces  Day  as  appropriate.  (T-3).  In  locations  and  situations where  two  or  more  military  services  are  represented,  joint  participation  in  community-sponsored programs is encouraged. 11.2.2.  Veterans  Day.  The  Administrator  of  Veterans  Affairs  is  usually  designated  by Presidential Proclamation as the Chairperson of the Veterans Day National Committee. The objective of this committee, comprised of representatives from major veteran’s organizations, is to stimulate and perpetuate national public interest in honoring all veterans of all wars on Veterans Day. Each year, this Committee designates certain communities as regional sites for observing this national holiday. DOD supports these observances by appointing a coordinator and  approving  military  support.  Regional  sites  are  designated  to  ensure  proper  priority  and appropriate  levels  of  support  are  available  for  these  major  observances.  DOD  policy  is  to  AFI35-105  23 JUNE 2017 47 provide  military  support  for  Veterans  Day  observances  in  communities  designated  as regional sites as well as for smaller local observances held in communities not designated as regional sites. 11.2.3.  Presidential  Wreath  Laying  Ceremony.    The  Office  of  the  Military  Assistant  to  the President provides Presidential wreaths and arranges for their annual placement at the tombs, burial sites, and monuments of all former presidents. The Air Force, through the MAJCOM or FOA indicated, provides Presidential  representatives at  wreath  laying  ceremonies for the following Presidents: Millard Fillmore (ANG), 7 January, at Buffalo, New York, and Lyndon B. Johnson (ANG), 27 August, at LBJ Ranch, Texas. 11.2.3.1.  The  minimum  military  grade  for  wreath  laying  ceremonies  is  a  Colonel  from the  installation  closest  to  the  site,  unless  overriding  considerations  preclude  the availability of a senior officer. The name, grade, title, address, and telephone number of each designated representative must be sent to SAF/PAY at least 65 days in advance of the month of wreath placement. (T-0) 11.3.  Joint Councils.  When there is more than one military installation in an area, community engagement efforts or programs  should be coordinated when appropriate.  Consideration should be  given  to  either  forming  a  joint  community  council  or  providing  for  representation  on  the separate councils. 11.4.  Musical Support at Public Events  . The use of Air Force bands is effective in informing the public about the Air Force, and fostering public trust and support with communities at home and abroad. Each event is an opportunity to engage and interact with a particular public on behalf of the Air Force and is planned and structured to maximize the effectiveness and impact of the message being delivered. Refer to AFI 35-110, Band Operations, for detailed guidance. 11.4.1.  Musical  support  of  events  includes,  but  is  not  limited  to,  public  events,  parades, concerts,  choral  presentations,  patriotic  openers  or  presentations,  and  community  outreach concert tours that are in the best interest of the Air Force. CONUS Regional Air Force bands operate in geographic AORs as assigned by SAF/PA. OCONUS Air Force bands operate in geographic AORs as assigned by PACAF and USAFE. The Air Force Premier band stationed in  Washington  D.C.  rotates  through  five  national  tour  areas  on  a  six  month  cycle  as determined  by  the  Deputy  Assistant  Secretary  of  Defense  for  Community  and  Public Outreach. 11.4.1.1.  Performances  by  Non-professional  Military  Musicians.    Official  military musical  performances  that  could  garner  national  media  attention  (i.e.,  singing  the National  Anthem  at  a  sporting  event)  should  be  performed  by  a  professional  military musician.  On  a  case-by-case  basis,  service  members  who  are  non-professional  military musicians who volunteer or are solicited to perform at such events must be approved by the  closest  military  band  commander  or  SAF/PAB  prior  to  accepting  an  invitation  to perform in uniform. Even if the service member volunteers to perform in civilian attire, if introduced  as  a  member  of  the  military,  prior  approval  is  still  required.    Refer  also  to guidance in DODI 5410.19. 11.4.2.  No  event  will  receive  the  support  of  more  than  one  musical  unit  without  prior approval of the ATSD(PA) or designated representative with two exceptions:  48 AFI35-105  23 JUNE 2017 11.4.2.1.  One  local  band  per  Military  Department  is  authorized  to  participate  in  local patriotic or civic parades (i.e., Armed Forces Day parades, Norfolk North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Festival parade, Veterans Day parades) that are of general interest or benefit to a local, state, regional, national or broadly representative community.  The parades should be sponsored or supported by the local government. 11.4.2.2.  Participation by more than one Military Department must be considered when extensive  support  is  required,  or  when  cross-Military  Department  representation  is applicable  on  occasions  where  it  is  in  the  best  interests  of  the  DOD  to  display  the members of the joint team. 11.4.3.  Musical  support  of  events  sponsored  by  non-federal  entities  is  limited  to  patriotic, military,  and  other  musical  selections  that  clearly  demonstrate  the  professionalism  of  the performers  and  focuses  attention  on  the  performance  as  an  Air  Force  music  presentation.  Authorized programs include concerts, parade participation, and patriotic presentations. 11.4.4.  Social  music,  background  music  and  dance  music  are  not  authorized  at  civilian sponsored  events,  unless  the  event  sponsor  is  a  military  welfare  society  as  identified  in  10 USC  §2566  as  amended  by  the  2010  National  Defense  Authorization  Act  (NDAA).  Background,  dance,  or  other  social  music  programs  are  authorized  for  official  U.S. Government events supported solely, or in part, by appropriated funds, regardless of location. (T-0)  AFI35-105  23 JUNE 2017 49 Chapter 12 SUPPORT FOR NON-GOVERNMENT ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTIONS 12.1.  Television,  Motion  Picture,  Documentary,  Unscripted  &  Other  Entertainment Production  Guidance  .  This  section  covers  guidance  governing  Air  Force  assistance  to  non-government scripted and unscripted productions, including motion pictures, DVD, television and web-based  movies;  series  and  mini-series  as  well  as  theatrical  productions,  game  shows  and video  games.  These  productions  are  primarily to  entertain.  The  SAF/PAY Entertainment Liaison Office in Los Angeles (SAF/PAYL) is the office of primary responsibility for liaising with the entertainment industry on all Air Force-related projects. intended 12.1.1.  DOD  Instruction  5410.16,  DOD  Assistance  to  Non-Government  Entertainment-Oriented  Media  Productions,  authorizes  assistance  to  an  entertainment-oriented  motion picture, television, DVD, or video production when cooperation benefits DOD or when this would be in the best national interest. See DODI 5410.16 for complete information. 12.1.2.  The OSD/PA-Special Assistant for Entertainment Media serves as the sole authority for  approving  DOD  assistance  to  non-government,  entertainment-oriented  motion  picture, television,  DVD  and  video  productions.  The  Special  Assistant  for  Entertainment  Media  is herein referred to as OASD/PA. (T-0) 12.1.3.  SAF/PAY  serves  as  the  Air  Force  approval  authority  for  official  support  before elevating  requests  to  OASD/PA  for  DOD-level  approval.  SAF/PAYL  serves  as  the  entry point for all requests, reviews and coordinates support requirements with MAJCOMs, makes a  qualifying  recommendation  to  OASD/PA,  and  is  ultimately  charged  with  preparing, coordinating,  and executing a DOD Production  Assistance Agreement.  Before a production company  officially  submits  a  project  to  OASD/PA,  SAF/PAYL  may  provide  advice  and courtesy assistance that might ultimately help to qualify the project for support. However, no premature commitments may be made. SAF/PAYL also provides the production company a copy  of  DODI  5410.16,  DOD  Assistance  to  Non-Government,  Entertainment-Oriented Media Productions. 12.2.  MAJCOMs.  Installations  will  be  asked  to  support  on-site  filming  requests  for  major motion  pictures,  television  shows  or  documentaries.  SAF/PAYL  reviews  requests  and  makes recommendations  to  MAJCOM/PA,  to  include  MAJCOM  and  local  unit  ability  to  support. MAJCOM/PA must ensure required documents are accomplished for its units before filming is allowed. (T-1) 12.3.  Installations.  If initially contacted by a representative from the entertainment industry (to include TV and motion picture companies and city and state film commission offices), the unit PA office, after gaining approval from the installation commander, should contact its MAJCOM and  who  should  contact  SAF/PAYL  in-turn  before  agreeing  to  anything.  If  contacted  by SAF/PAY  or  MAJCOMs  concerning  projects  already  under  SAF/PAYL  review,  units  should advise MAJCOMs of their ability to support. (T-1) 12.4.  Production  Companies  .  SAF/PAYL  collaborates  and  coordinates  with  production companies  to  develop  a  project  that  will  qualify  for  DOD  approved  assistance.  Before  a production  company  officially  submits  a  project  to  OASD/PA  for  support  consideration, SAF/PAYL  may  provide  courtesy  assistance,  as  in  project  research  and  development,  thereby  50 AFI35-105  23 JUNE 2017 helping  the  production  company  to  develop  a  script  that  might  ultimately  qualify  for  DOD assistance. 12.4.1.  The production company submits to OASD/PA, via SAF/PAYL, a formal request for production  assistance.    To  begin  the  process,  refer  the  production  company  to  SAF/PAYL office  website:  www.airforcehollywood.af.mil.  On  this  website,  the  production  company will need to  complete a "Production Request  Support  Form."  Once completed, the website instructs  the  production  company  to  e-mail  the  form  to  the  organizational  email  box.  SAF/PAYL will review the request and coordinate appropriately. 12.4.2.  Production  companies  will  be  required  to  provide  complete  scripts  for  review  and evaluation upon request  of SAF/PAYL.  All information provided is considered proprietary and is treated accordingly. 12.4.3.  SAF/PAYL reviews the request and determines initial support feasibility and, when necessary, coordinates with appropriate Air Staff agencies and MAJCOMs. Any comments, changes,  or  problems  are  resolved  by  SAF/PAYL,  and  recommendation  for  approval  or disapproval is sent to OASD/PA. 12.4.4.  Once support approval is granted, if the original request submitted was not complete as far as final scripting or specific support requirements, these are coordinated and approved by  SAF/PAYL  and  OASD/PA  as  soon  as  possible  thereafter.  Support  approval  or disapproval gets communicated to the producer by OASD/PA or SAF/PAYL. 12.4.5.  Once  a project  is granted OASD/PA approval,  SAF/PAYL is authorized to  provide official production support through an assigned project officer. SAF/PAYL assists with script review  and  rewrite,  filming  location  arrangements,  stock  footage  research  and  acquisition, on-site technical advice, handling of insurance and reimbursement arrangements, and review of completed projects. 12.4.6.  On  occasion,  local  PA  units  will  be  asked  to  assist  with  on-ground  support  if  it’s determined  to  be  in  the  Air  Force’s  best  interest.  A  representative  from  SAF/PAYL  will always be on-site.  AFI35-105  23 JUNE 2017 51 Chapter 13 USE OF AIR FORCE MEMBERS AS EXTRAS, IN GAME SHOWS OR ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTIONS 13.1.  Use of Air Force People In Non DoD-Supported Entertainment programs.  Air Force people  who  appear  in  non-government  entertainment-oriented  productions  (non-news)  do  so voluntarily.    Members  must  have  their  individual  commander's  approval  and  may  need MAJCOM approval to appear.  Members may participate in these programs but only in his/her personal,  off-duty  capacity.    Members  may  not  wear  their  uniform  for  any  of  the  segments  or arrange  to  use,  military  facilities  or  equipment  in  support  of  any  portions  of  this  program  or provide  any  footage  (to  include  filming  the  member  on  base  or  at  their  job)  that  gives  the appearance or impression of Air Force endorsement. Members should also coordinate with their local  PAO  for  media  training.    All  active  duty  members  must  be  in  a  leave  or  commander approved off-duty status.  (T-1).  Permissive TDY is  generally not  authorized. Even though the requirements may state a certain time frame and will require leave, individuals should know that they may be required to make other appearances on behalf of the show or there may be instances where they would be required to stay on leave more than 45 days due to  production schedules. Commanders should not  sign any forms  generated by production companies indicating that the member will not be deployed during the duration of filming the program. Active-duty & Reserve members  must  also  have  an  approved  AF  Form  3902,  Application  for  Off-Duty  Employment, prior  to  leaving  home  duty  installations  for  casting/auditions  and  for  participation.  (T-1).  The form should document any compensation that the member may receive.  Compensation includes travel,  airline  tickets,  per  diem,  lodging,  food,  gifts  and  prizes,  etc.    The  form  also  allows  for review  from  JA  regarding  any  joint  ethics  regulations  in  the  case  of  compensation  for participation and/or in the event the person wins prizes on the show. SAF/PAYL should also be informed, to provide further guidance to members. 13.2.  Use of Airmen as Extras In Approved DoD entertainment productions. 13.2.1.  If  Airmen  are  performing  normal  duties  during  the  time  of  an  approved  DOD supported production, they are said to be on-duty and cannot be paid by the producer, nor are they required to participate. 13.2.2.  If Airmen  are not  performing normal  duties while taking part in  an approved DOD production, they are off-duty. Airmen in an off-duty, non-official status may be hired by the production  company  to  perform  as  actors,  extras,  etc.,  provided  they  are  on  leave  or  in  a commander approved off-duty status, have an approved AF Form 3902,  Application for Off-Duty  Employment,  and  there  is  no  conflict  with  any  other  Air  Force  instruction.  In  such cases,  contractual  arrangements  are  solely  between  those  individuals  and  the  production company;  however,  payment  should  be  commensurate  with  current  industry  standards.  The production  company  is  responsible  for  resolving  any  disputes  with  unions  governing  the hiring of non-union actors and extras.  Military personnel accepting such employment shall adhere  to  DODD  5500.07,  Standards  of  Conduct.  (T-0).    The  individual's  uniform  may  be worn  only  when  it  is  used  to  identify  the  military  service  to  which  the  individual  belongs. Local  units  may  assist  the  production  company  in  publicizing  the  opportunity  for employment and in identifying appropriate personnel.  52 AFI35-105  23 JUNE 2017 13.3.  Member Participation in Game & Talk Shows. 13.3.1.  General  Guidance.  Air  Force  members  may  participate  in  game/quiz  shows  when such  participation  does  not  detract  from  the  dignity  and  prestige  of  the  Air  Force.  The following factors should be weighed in favor of participation when appropriate: 13.3.1.1.  The show is devoted mainly to observing a national holiday or is dedicated to the U.S. Armed Forces or a particular service. 13.3.1.2.  The show is local and originates entirely from a military installation. 13.3.1.3.  The appearance of Air Force personnel is for a purpose that has no commercial counterpart or that contributes to a specific Air Force interest. 13.3.1.4.  The show supports national interests. 13.3.1.5.  Members  may  appear  when  they  are  newsworthy  in  their  own  right  or  when appearing  as  an  Air  Force  official  to  provide  information  on  Air  Force  subjects  to  the listening or viewing audience. 13.3.1.6.  A  show's  sponsors  or  business  practices  do  not  reflect  adversely  on  the  Air Force. 13.4.  Member  coordination  with  PA  .  A  member  coordinates  with  his  or  her  base-level  PA office if he or she intends to  participate  either in or out  of uniform, or  by  expressly presenting himself or herself as a member of the Air Force. 13.3.1.  The base-level PA office should in-turn inform its MAJCOM, which will coordinate with SAF/PAYL as outlined below based on the show format. 13.5.  Unscripted & Talk Shows  . SAF/PAYL is the OPR for coordination and approval of an Air  Force  member's  participation  on  a  talk  or  unscripted  program.  Member  participation  is approved on a case-by-case basis. 13.6.  Participation in Commercials  . Participation in endorsing or marketing any commercial products  is  strictly prohibited.  If necessary, SAF/PAYL is  also  the OPR for coordination of an Air Force member's participation and involvement in all commercials depicting any relationship with a product and the Air Force or any Airman. 13.7.  Game/Quiz  Shows  .  SAF/PAYL  is  the  OPR  for  coordinating  an  Airman’s  participation on a game/quiz show. 13.7.1.  Military-Themed  Game/Quiz  Shows.  When  a  military  installation  takes  an  active role in providing military contestants, approvals by SAF/PAYL and OASD/PA are necessary for  military  members'  participation  (other  than  as  audience  members  only),  whether appearing in or out of uniform. Military personnel selected as game or quiz show participants should be placed in a leave or other authorized off-duty status. 13.7.2.  Non-Military Themed Game/Quiz Shows. Military personnel who independently go to a studio to be a member of a game or quiz show audience and have the possibility of being selected out of the audience for participation are encouraged to contact SAF/PAYL prior to attending.  SAF/PAYL  can  advise  on  which  Air  Force  uniform  (if  any)  is  appropriate.  If randomly selected, military members should inform their unit PA office as soon as possible, which should in-turn inform its MAJCOM and SAF/PAYL.  AFI35-105  23 JUNE 2017 53 EDWARD W.
