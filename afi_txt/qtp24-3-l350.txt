Aircraft Tow Design.  Aircraft tows vary in size, shape, and specifications, determined by make and model; it is imperative to know the specifications and rated loads of the aircraft tow that is about to be operated before using it.  Specifications and rated load information should be used together to determine the proper use and area in which the aircraft tow will be used.    This  information  is  best  found  in  the  appropriate  TO  or  for  quick  reference,  the information may be found on the vehicle data plate located on the aircraft tow.  5.2.4.  Specifications.  Specifications generally described are equipment dimensions/weight; engine/drive train information and fluid types.  5.2.5.  Rated  Load/Capabilities.    Rated  loads  and  capabilities  generally  described  are  the towing rating and the tongue weight capacity of the pintle hook.  5.3. Vehicle Inspection.  5.3.1.  Types of Vehicle Inspection.

Do not set the parking brake when freezing conditions are present.     5.5.5.3.1.   Setting  the  parking  brake  in  freezing  conditions  could  result  in  a  frozen brake cable and stuck brakes. 5.5.5.3.2.   Instead, chock the vehicle and put the selector switch into either PARK (for standard automatic transmissions) or REVERSE (for vehicles that do not have a PARK selection).  5.5.5.4.  Do not leave a vehicle outside for long periods of time unattended.  5.5.5.4.1.   Leaving  a  vehicle,  especially  one  with  a  diesel  engine,  outside  in  cold weather for a long period of time will make it very difficult to start.   5.5.5.4.2.   Bring the vehicle back to the Vehicle Support Building so that it can be stored indoors until it is again needed.  5.6. Aircraft Tow Operation.  5.6.1.  Operators  must  be  thoroughly  familiar  with  the  safety  precautions,  principles  of operation,  location  and  use  of  controls  and  accessories  and  handling  characteristics  of  the vehicle before attempting any operation or service procedure.

The specific weight ratings for the vehicle can be found in the manufacturer’s operator’s manual.  This will vary from vehicle to vehicle.  5.6.3.  Starting the engine.  5.6.3.1.  Set parking brake.  Parking brake lever must be set when the engine is not running.  5.6.3.2.  Ensure the transmission is set to N (neutral).  The engine will not start unless the transmission direction control lever is in neutral position and the battery disconnect switch is ON.  5.6.3.3.  Turn starting switch to ON position and wait until orange wait light goes out, signifying the glow plugs have warmed up.  5.6.3.4.  Depress accelerator halfway to the floor and hold in that position.  5.6.3.5.  Never crank the engine for more than 30 seconds during an attempted start.  If the engine fails to start over 30 seconds, allow the starting motor two minutes to cool down prior to attempting another start.  5.6.3.6.  Check engine instruments for proper operation.   5.6.3.6.1.   Turn the IGNITION switch to the OFF if the engine OIL PRESS gauge does not read 10 pounds per square inch (psi) minimum within seconds after starting.  5.6.3.6.2.   Normal engine water temperature is from 180°F - 200°F.  Normal engine oil pressure at idle speed is 16 psi minimum at rated speed is 40-60 psi.  If the PRESS gauge does not display normal readings, shutdown the engine immediately and correct the malfunction. 5.6.4.  Forward driving.  5.6.4.1.  Remove wheel chocks.  5.6.4.2.

Use optional four wheel drive capabilities ONLY when more traction is required.  5.6.5.7.  Before shifting from two wheel drive to four wheel drive (or from four back to two) the towing tractor MUST be stopped.  5.6.5.8.  Always check the pintle hook connection to see that the hook is properly engaged with the drawbar lunette eye.  Also take into consideration the physical size and steering characteristics of the load being towed.  5.6.5.9.  Refer to the Pintle Hook Lesson Plan for additional information on pintle hook use and safety.  5.6.6.  Reverse driving.  5.6.6.1.  Remove wheel chocks.  5.6.6.2.  Depress brake pedal.  5.6.6.3.
