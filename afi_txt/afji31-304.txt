EstablishmentInternment facilities will be established in the communications zoneof  each  theater  of  operations  for  the  purpose  of  receiving,  account-ing  for,  administering,  securing,  and  logistically  supporting  EPW/RP.3–2.  EPW  internment  facilitiesa.  The  operation  of  all  EPW  internment  facilities  is  governed  bythe  provisions  of  the  Geneva  Conventions.b.  The theater commander remains responsible for the location ofEPW  facilities.  EPW/RP  may  be  interned  only  in  premises  locatedon  land  and  affording  proper  health  and  hygiene  standards.  Exceptin  extreme  circumstances,  in  the  best  interests  of  the  individual,EPW/RP will not be interned in correctional facilities housing mili-tary or civilian prisoners. Prisoners will not normally be interned inunhealthy areas, or where the climate proves to be injurious to them,and  will  be  removed  as  soon  as  possible  to  a  more  favorable  cli-mate.  Transit  camps  or  collecting  points  will  operate  under  condi-tions  similar  to  those  prescribed  for  permanent  prisoner  of  warcamps,  and  the  prisoners  will  receive  the  same  treatment  as  inpermanent  EPW  camps.c.  The  internment  facility  will  be  marked  with  the  letters  “PW”(Prisoner of War Camps) and will be placed so they will be clearlyvisible from the air during the daytime. Other markings may be usedwhen  agreed  to  by  the  combatant  commanders  and  approved  byHQDA.3–3.  EPW  Facility  Managementa.  The  United  States  may  subject  EPW/RP  to  internment  andmay  have  contingency  plans  to  confine  and  enclose  EPW  in  campslocated  both  in  and  outside  CONUS.  Medical  personnel  and  chap-lains classified as RP, while retained by the Detaining Power with aview to assisting prisoners of war, shall not be considered prisonersof  war.  The  EPW  facility  commander  will  provide  command,  con-trol,  accountability,  administrative,  and  logistical  support  for  theoperation of all EPW/CI facilities. The EPW/CI facility commanderwill:(1)  Intern  prisoners  captured  by  or  transferred  to  the  custody  ofU.S.  forces.(2)  Process  interned  prisoners  to  include  tagging,  assignment  ofISN,  fingerprinting,  photographing,  and  weighing,  as  needed.(a)  EPW  and  RP  may  be  required  to  show  their  identity  cardissued  by  his  or  her  government;  however  in  no  case  may  the  cardbe  taken  from  the  individual.(b)  If an EPW does not hold an identity card issued by his or herAR  190–8/OPNAVINST  3461.6/AFJI  31–304/MCO  3461.1  •  1  October  19975government, the EPW will be issued a completed DA Form 2662-R(EPW Identity Card).

Certification of the retained status of personnel will be effectedupon  the  decision  that  the  special  identity  card  held  by  each  suchperson  is  valid  and  authentic.  This  certification  will  be  decided,  ifpossible,  at  the  time  of  processing  by  the  camp  commander.f.  The  Theater  Commander,  or  CINCUSACOM  will  confirm  thecertification of the technical proficiency of the persons described  inparagraph 3-15d.

The third copy will be forwarded tothe  Branch  PWIC.i.  Verifications  of  retained  status  and  religious  or  medical  profi-ciency  will  be  recorded  on  the  DA  Form  4237-R  of  the  personconcerned.  Denials  of  claims  to  retained  status  or  certification  ofproficiency  will  also  be  recorded  together  with  a  brief  statement  ofthe  reason.j.  RP  are  subject  to  the  internal  discipline  of  the  camp  in  whichthey  are  retained;  however,  they  may  not  be  compelled  to  do  anywork  except  that  relating  to  their  medical  or  religious  duties.k.  RP,  who  are  members  of  the  enemy’s  Armed  Forces,  will  beassigned  to  EPW  camps.  If  available,  they  will  be  assigned  in  theratio of two physicians, two nurses, one chaplain, and seven enlistedmedical  personnel  per  1,000  EPW.  Economy  of  medical  staffingmay  be  achieved  at  higher  levels  per  guidance  from  CommandingGeneral,  HSC.  As  much  as  possible,  these  RP  will  be  assigned  tocamps  containing  EPW  from  the  same  Armed  Forces  upon  whichthe  RP  depend.l.  CINCs, Task Force Commanders, Joint Task Force Command-ers  are  authorized  to  transfer  RP  and  EPW  who  are  qualified  toperform  medical  or  religious  duties  between  EPW  camps  withintheir  jurisdiction  in  order  to  distribute  them  equitably.m.

While  caring  for  the  sick  and  wounded,  RP  will  receive  thesame  daily  rate  of  pay  as  is  received  by  EPW.r.  Monthly  allowances  for  RP  will  be  the  same  as  those  pre-scribed  for  EPW  of  the  same  rank.s.  RP may be detained in EPW camps. When practical, they willbe  assigned  quarters  separate  from  EPW.t.  RP  will  wear  on  their  left  sleeve  a  water  resistant  arm  bandbearing  the  distinctive  emblem  (Red  Cross,  Red  Crescent)  issuedand stamped by the military authority of the power with which theyhave served. Authorized persons who do not have such armbands intheir possession will be provided with Geneva Convention brassards(AR  670-1).u.  RP  will  enjoy  the  same  correspondence  privileges  as  EPW.Chaplains  will  be  free  to  correspond,  subject  to  censorship,  onmatters  about  their  religious  duties.  Correspondence  may  be  withecclesiastical authorities both in the country where they are retainedand  in  the  country  on  which  they  depend,  and  with  internationalreligious  organizations.  RP  will  be  authorized  the  following  addi-tional  privileges:(1)  They will be granted facilities necessary to provide EPW withmedical  care,  spiritual  assistance,  and  welfare  services.(2)  They  will  be  authorized  to  visit  EPW  periodically  in  branchcamps and in hospitals outside the EPW camps in order to carry outtheir  medical,  spiritual,  or  welfare  duties.(3)  They  will  be  given  the  necessary  means  of  transportation  formaking  such  visits.(4)  The senior retained medical officer, as well as chaplains, willhave the right to correspond and consult with the camp commanderor  his  or  her  authorized  representatives  on  all  questions  about  theirduties.v.  RP are subject to the same disciplinary measures as are EPW.w.  RP  will  be  retained  only  insofar  as  the  state  of  health,  thespiritual  needs,  and  the  number  of  EPW  require.  Persons  whoseretention  is  not  required  will  be  repatriated  as  soon  as  militaryrequirements permit. Nothing precludes reasonable measures to pre-vent  such  persons  from  carrying  information  of  strategic  or  tacticalvalue.  Should  they  come  into  possession  of  such  information,  theirreturn  to  their  own  armed  force  may  be  delayed  until  the  informa-tion  is  of  no  significant  value.3–16.  Complaints  and  requests  to  camp  commandersa.  EPW  and  RP  have  the  right  to  make  complaints  and  requeststo camp commanders and the ICRC/protecting powers regarding theconditions  of  their  internment.  EPW  and  RP  may  not  be  punishedfor  making  complaints,  even  if  those  complaints  later  prove  un-founded.  Complaints  will  be  received  in  confidence,  as  they  mightendanger the safety of other detainees. Appropriate action, includingsegregation, will be taken to protect detainees when necessary. Thispolicy also applies to persons who are confined pending trial or as aresult  of  a  trial.b.  EPW  and  RP  may  take  complaints  or  requests  to  the  campcommander.c .

General  principlesa.  To the extent possible, EPW will be employed in work neededto  construct,  administer,  manage,  and  maintain  EPW  camps.  EPWwill  be  employed  in  other  essential  work  permitted  by  this  regula-tion  only  when  qualified  civilian  labor  is  not  available.  Essentialwork  is  work  that  must  be  done,  despite  the  availability  of  EPW.b.  EPW  labor,  external  to  DOD,  is  regulated  by  contract.  Whenauthorized  by  theater  directives,  EPW,  RP  may  be  given  advancepay.  Procedures  for  administering  this  advance  pay  are  set  forth  inAR  37-1.4–2.  Restricted  employmenta.  EPW  will  not  be  employed  in  positions  that  require  or  permitthem:(1)  Access  to  classified  defense  information  or  records  of  otherpersonnel.(2)  Access  to  telephone  or  other  communication  systems.(3)  Authority  to  command  or  instruct  U.S.  personnel.b.  EPW  may  be  employed  in  the  following  types  of  labor:(1)  EPW  camp  administration,  installation,  or  maintenance.(2)  Agriculture.(3)  Public  works,  public  utilities,  and  building  operations  whichhave  no  military  character  or  purpose.(4)  Transportation  and  handling  of  stores  which  are  not  militaryin  nature  or  purpose.(5)  Domestic  service.4–3.  Liability  to  perform  labora.  Subject  to  the  limitations  stated  in  paragraph  4-5  and  4-6,EPW  will  be  required  to  perform  any  and  all  work  consistent  withtheir  grade  and  status  as  follows:(1)  Officer  EPW.  Officer  EPW  will  not  be  required  to  work.Officer  EPW,  however,  may  make  a  written  request  for  work.  Thecamp  commander  will  provide  such  work,  if  feasible.  Officer  EPWmay, at any time, revoke a voluntary request for work. Officer EPWare  required  to  maintain  their  personal  areas,  equipment  and  otheritems/areas  in  a  manner  that  promotes  good  health  and  personalhygiene.(2)  Noncommissioned  officer  (NCO)  EPW.  NCO  EPW  will  berequired  to  do  supervisory  work  only.  NCO  EPW,  however,  maymake a written request for work other than supervisory work.

Enlisted  EPW  will  be  required  to  do  any  andall  work  consistent  with  this  regulation.b.  Fitness of EPW for labor will be verified at least once a monthby  medical  examination.  An  attending  medical  officer  will  classifythe  level  of  physical  fitness  EPW  can  perform  for  work  as  follows:heavy work, light work, and no work. Lists of these individual laborlevels  of  EPW  will  be  posted  in  each  EPW  camp.  If  physicalconditions  permit,  each  EPW  will  perform  labor  as  directed  by  thecamp  commander.4–4.  Authorized  worka.  Categories.  Levels  of  work  for  which  each  EPW  are  author-ized  and  may  be  compelled  to  perform  are  categorized  as  follows:(1)  Restricted  work.  EPW  may  be  compelled  to  perform  the  fol-lowing  types  which  may  not  be  of  a  military  nature  or  purpose:(a)  Public  works  and  building  operations.  The  primary  factor  indeciding  whether  EPW  may  be  employed  is  the  nature  of  the  con-struction  being  undertaken.  If  the  construction  is  purely  military  innature, each EPW may not be compelled to engage in such work. Ifthe  construction  is  not  purely  military  in  nature,  the  purpose  forwhich  the  structure  is  to  be  used  is  the  deciding  factor.  If  thecompleted  construction  is  intended  to  be  used  primarily  by  unitsengaged  in,  or  in  direct  support  of,  military  operations  against  theenemy,  EPW  may  not  be  compelled  to  work  on  the  project.(b)  Transporting  and  handling  stores.  The  first  consideration  isthe nature of the property being handled. If the stores are military innature,  EPW  may  not  be  compelled  to  transport  or  handle  them.  Ifthe items are not military in nature, then their purpose is the decid-ing  factor.  EPW  may  not  be  required  to  transport  or  handle  storesspecifically consigned to units engaged in military operations. EPWand  RP  may,  however,  be  required  to  handle  stores  when  handlingis  incidental  to  the  performance  of  authorized  types  of  work.  Forexample,  work  in  a  military  mess  may  be  classified  as  domesticservice.  Handling  of  rations  by  EPW  in  connection  with  domesticservice  may  be  required.(c)  Public utility services. Construction, repair, or maintenance ofwater,  sewage,  drainage,  gas,  or  electrical  facilities  are  not  of  aninherent military nature. The purpose of these services is the decid-ing factor as to whether or not EPW may be compelled to engage insuch  activities.  Such  services  may  be  intended  primarily  or  ex-clusively  for  the  benefit  of  units  engaged  in,  or  directly  supporting,operations  against  the  enemy.  If  so,  EPW  may  not  be  required  toperform these services. On the other hand, services intended  prima-rily or exclusively for other purposes represent work that EPW maybe  compelled  to  perform.(2)  Nonrestricted work. EPW may be compelled to perform typesof  work  listed  below  having  no  direct  military  purpose:(a)  Construction,  administration,  management,  and  maintenanceof  EPW  camps.(b)  Agriculture.(c)  Manufacturing industries, with the exception of metallurgical,machinery,  and  chemical  industries.(d)  Commercial  business  and  arts  and  crafts.(e)  Domestic  service,  including  a  clothing  repair  shop,  laundry,bakery,  or  a  mess  hall.4–5.  Unauthorized  worka.  Unhealthy  or  dangerous  work.  EPW  and  RP  may  not  be  em-ployed  in  any  job  considered  injurious  to  health  or  dangerous  be-cause of the inherent nature of the work, the conditions under whichit is performed, or the person’s physical unfitness or lack of techni-cal skill. A specific task should be considered, not the industry as awhole. The specific conditions for each job are the deciding factors.For  example,  an  otherwise  dangerous  task  may  be  rendered  safe  bythe use of safety equipment. Likewise, an otherwise safe job may bedangerous  because  of  the  circumstances  under  which  the  work  isrequired  to  be  done.  Similarly,  dangerous  work  may  be  safe  forthose  whose  training  and  experience  have  made  them  adept  at  it.EPW  will  not  be  employed  in  tasks  requiring:(1)  Exertion  beyond  physical  capacity.(2)  Use  of  inherently  dangerous  mechanisms  or  materials  suchas:(a)  explosives  or  mine  removal.(b)  Mechanisms  that  are  dangerous  because  the  person  is  unskil-led  in  their  use.(3)  Climbing  to  dangerous  heights  or  exposure  to  risk  of  injuryfrom  falling  objects  under  motion  and  not  under  full  control.b.  Humiliating  work.  No  person  will  be  assigned  labor  that  ishumiliating  or  degrading  for  a  member  of  the  U.S.  Armed  Forces.This  prohibition  does  not  prevent  EPW  from  doing  ordinary  andfrequently  unpleasant  tasks  such  as  maintaining  sanitation  facilities,ditch  digging  and  manual  labor  in  agriculture.c .   O t h e r   s p e c i f i c a l l y   p r o h i b i t e d   w o r k .   C e r t a i n   o c c u p a t i o n s   o rtypes  of  work  are  prohibited  for  safety,  security,  or  other  reasons.EPW  and  RP  will  not  be:(1)  Permitted  to  work  in  an  area  where  they  may  be  exposed  tocombat  zone  fire.( 2 )   E m p l o y e d   a s   p e r s o n a l   s e r v a n t s   t o   m e m b e r s   o f   t h e   U .

Questionable  work.  In  case  of  doubt  as  to  whether  certainwork is authorized, the next higher HQ Staff Judge Advocate (SJA)will review the proposed tasks. The purpose of the review will be toensure consistency with this regulation and the law of war. The SJAwill provide recommendations in writing to the camp commander. Acopy  will  be  forwarded  to  HQDA  (DAJA-IA),  WASH  DC  20310-2214.4–6.  Decisions  on  work  conditions  and  safeguardsCommanders  will  make  on-the-job  decisions  as  to  whether  work  issafe.  They  will  take  into  account  the  guidance  set  forth  in  thisregulation.  Commanders  will  make  decisions  by  ordinary  standardsof  sound  judgment,  assisted  by  the  informed  advice  of  personsfamiliar  with  the  occupations  and  other  available  data.  Data  willinclude  the  opinions  of  the  SJA.  Preliminary  job  training  will  begiven  when  necessary  and;  protective  clothing  and  accessories  willbe provided as required (e.g., hard-toed shoes, goggles, and gloves).Such safety devices will be equal to safeguards provided for civilianlabor.  Commanders  will  make  periodic  inspections  to  ensure  satis-factory  conditions  and  safeguards  are  maintained  at  all  times.4–7.  Referrals  to  HQDA,  ODCSOPSa.
