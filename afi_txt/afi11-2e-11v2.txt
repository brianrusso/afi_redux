General.  This  AFI  provides  flight  examiners  (FE)  and  aircrew  members  with  procedures and evaluation criteria/tolerances to be used during flight evaluations required by AFI 11-202V2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program. 1.2.  Evaluations.  Evaluations  shall  be  administered  by  a  USAF  or  FAA  certified  flight examiner in an aircraft or FAA Level C or D simulator, known as an Aircrew Training Device (ATD) in this regulation. 1.2.1.  Units are authorized to conduct flight evaluations on any mission. 1.3.  Keywords and Definitions  . 1.3.1.  “Will and “shall” indicate a mandatory requirement. 1.3.2.  “Should”  is  normally  used  to  indicate  a  preferred,  but  not  mandatory,  method  of accomplishment. 1.3.3.  “May” indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment. 1.3.4.  “Note”  indicates  operating  procedures,  techniques,  etc.,  which  are  considered essential. 1.4.  Waivers and Deviations. 1.4.1.  MAJCOM/A3 is the waiver authority according to AFI 11-202V2 and the appropriate MAJCOM supplement.  MAJCOM/A3 will forward a copy of approved long-term waivers to this instruction to lead command for follow-on action, if required. 1.4.2.  Deviations.  Do not deviate from the policies and guidance in this AFI under normal circumstances,  except  for  safety  or  when  necessary  to  protect  the  crew  or  aircraft  from  a situation not covered by this AFI and immediate action is required. 1.5.  Flight Examiner (FE).  FEs administer evaluations IAW AFI 11-202V2 and Chapter 2 in this AFI. 1.5.1.  Unless specified, the examinee or FE may fly in any flight position/seat that provides the FE the best position observe and conduct the evaluation. 1.5.2.  The FE briefs the examinee on the purpose of the evaluation and how evaluations are administered  prior  to  flight.    The  FE  debriefs  all  aspects  of  the  evaluation.    This  debrief includes the examinee's overall rating, specific deviations, area grades assigned (if other than qualified) and any required additional training. 1.5.3.  A  FE  other  than  the  one  who  administered  the  original  evaluation  should  administer any re-evaluations. 1.5.4.  The FE will immediately notify the examinee’s unit commander or operations officer when less than Q-1 performance is observed. (T-2). 1.5.5.  FEs will immediately correct breaches of flying safety or flight discipline. (T-1) When an examinee jeopardizes safety of flight, the evaluator may assume the duties of that aircrew 4 AFI11-2E-11V2  12 SEPTEMBER 2017 member.  This does not mean the flight examiner must assume the examinee’s position any time unsatisfactory performance is observed. 1.6.  Grading  Instructions.  Standards  and  performance  parameters  are  contained  in  AFI  11-202V2 and this instruction.  Use the criteria in  Table 1.1 (unless criteria in Chapter 2 is more restrictive) as a general tolerance for airspeed, altitude, and heading/course in the applicable sub-areas unless otherwise directed. Table 1.1.  General Flight Criteria.  Altitude Airspeed Q +/- 100 feet +10/-5 KIAS Heading / Course +/- 5 degrees Notes: Q- +/- 200 feet +15/-10 KIAS +/- 10 degrees 1.  USE USAF tolerances since General Altitude, Airspeed and Heading / Course tolerances are not adequately addressed in the Airline Transport Pilot And Aircraft Type Rating Practical Test Standards for Airplane (FAA-S-8081 5F). 2:  Add 5 KIAS, 50 feet (when practical), and 2 degrees to all engines operating criteria for single-engine operations during the EPE or during simulated single-engine operations on the flight evaluation (if accomplished).  1.6.1.  The  overall  evaluation  grade  will  be  derived  from  individual  area  grades  based  on  a composite for the observed events and tasks. (T-3) This grade should be awarded only after all evaluation requirements have been completed and given due consideration. 1.6.2.  Sound  FE  judgment  should  be  exercised  when  applying  subjective  area  grades,  for specific situations not covered, and for assigning the overall grade. 1.6.3.  Critical  Areas.    Critical  areas  require  adequate  accomplishment  by  the  aircrew member  in  order  to  successfully  achieve  the  mission  objectives.    If  an  aircrew  member receives  an  unqualified  grade  in  any  critical  area,  the  overall  grade  for  the  evaluation  will also be unqualified. 1.7.  Unsatisfactory Performance. 1.7.1.  Examinees receiving an overall grade of unqualified (U) will be placed in supervised status until recommended additional training and re-evaluation are completed. (T-2). 1.7.2.  A Q-3 grade will be assigned for unsatisfactory performance in any critical area or if the flight examiner assumes the examinee’s duties. (T-1). 1.7.3.  Unsatisfactory  performance  in  a  non-critical  area  will  result  in  no  higher  than  a qualification level Q-2. (T-1). 1.7.4.  ATD  may  be  used  to  accomplish  additional  training  and  re-evaluations.    Areas  for additional training and re-evaluation should be limited to those areas that can be realistically accomplished in the ATD. AFI11-2E-11V2  12 SEPTEMBER 2017 5 1.8.  Qualification and Difference Certification. 1.8.1.  All  pilots  at  a  minimum  will  be  qualified  in  the  XRS-variant  of  the  E-11A.    Upon completion of an Initial Qualification Evaluation, the aircraft type will be documented as "E-11A" on the AF Form 8. (T-2). 1.8.2.  Individuals  who  have  completed  contractor-provided  Global  Vision  Flight  Deck (GVFD) differences training are not  required to  take an additional QUAL evaluation  in  the aircraft.  Annotate “E-11 GFVD/6000 Certified” in the Comments section of the AF Form 8. 1.8.3.  RVSM Certification. Individuals will complete AFFSA’s RVSM Training.  Annotate “E-11A RVSM Certified” in the Comments section of the AF Form 8. (T-2). 6 AFI11-2E-11V2  12 SEPTEMBER 2017 Chapter 2 PILOT EVALUATIONS 2.1.  Evaluation  Requirements.  This instrument  (INSTM), qualification  (QUAL),  mission  (MSN),  instructor  (INSTR),  requalification  (RQ),  emergency procedure (EPE), SPOT, and no-notice (N/N) evaluation criteria. instruction  standardizes the 2.1.1.  Evaluations  are  administered  using  the  areas,  including  critical/non-critical  areas, listed in Paragraph 2.3.  Instructor evaluations adhere to guidance IAW Chapter 3. 2.1.2.  Aircrews  will  successfully  complete  an  initial  (INIT)  evaluation  for  each  category, then annually as appropriate, at 17-month intervals according to AFI 11-202V2.  Align dates, if possible, to minimize operational impacts and ensure requisites are met.  MSN and INSTR evaluations must be accomplished in the aircraft. (T-2). 2.1.2.1.  Alternate  Method.    When  it  is  impossible  to  evaluate  an  area  in-flight  due  to equipment  malfunctions,  operational  requirements,  scheduling  restrictions,  or  weather, the  area  may  be  evaluated  by  an  alternate  method  (i.e.  procedural  trainer  or  verbal examination).    If,  in  the  flight  examiners  judgement,  an  item  cannot  be  adequately evaluated by an alternate method, complete the evaluation on an additional flight. 2.1.3.  Aircrew  Testing  may  be  accomplished  by  end-of-course  (EOC)  exams  administered by a USAF approved civilian training course. 2.1.4.  An  evaluation  will  not  be  changed  to  a  training  mission  to  avoid  documenting substandard performance, nor will a training mission be changed to an evaluation. (T-2) 2.1.5.  Grading  Criteria.    To  the  maximum  extent  possible,  flight  examiners  utilize  grading criteria  outlined  in  this  volume  to  determine  individual  grading  areas.    Exercise  judgment when  the  wording  of  areas  is  subjective  and  when  specific  areas  are  not  covered.    Flight examiner  judgment  contributes  to  the  determining  factor  in  arriving  at  the  overall  grade.  Consider cumulative deviations when determining overall grade. 2.1.5.1.  Tolerance assessments for in-flight parameters as based on conditions of smooth air and a stable aircraft.  In some cases, momentary deviations are allowable provided the examinee applies prompt corrective action and such deviations do not jeopardize safety. 2.2.

Instructor Evaluation.  All flying personnel selected for instructor duty must be evaluated to determine their judgment, technical knowledge, instructor ability (including error analysis of student activity), and use of grading documents as well as proficiency in their aircrew specialty.  To  initially  qualify  as  an  instructor,  a  crewmember  must  successfully  complete  an  initial instructor  evaluation.    Initial  instructor  evaluations  may  be  conducted  in  conjunction  with  the examinee's periodic qualification evaluation and should be accomplished on actual instructional missions  whenever  possible.    Periodic  evaluation  of  the  ability  of  aircrew  members  to  instruct will be conducted during all subsequent periodic evaluations. 3.1.1.  Instructors  must  demonstrate  proficiency  by  instructing  an  actual  student  whenever possible  (or  a  qualified  individual  acting  as  a  student).
