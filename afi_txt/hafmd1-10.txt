The Secretary of the Air Force retains ultimate responsibility for all policies related to the Department of the Air Force.  Within his or her areas of responsibility, SAF/AQ prepares policies for approval and issues official guidance via official Air Force publication to ensure implementation of those policies. 2. Organizational Relationships.  The Secretary of the Air Force is responsible for, and has all legal authority necessary to conduct, the affairs of the Department of the Air Force.  The Secretariat, the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, and Air Staff offices perform their Department of the Air Force functions subject to the authority, direction, and control of the Secretary of the Air Force. 2.1.
