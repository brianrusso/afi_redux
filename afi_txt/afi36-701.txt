Employee  Rights.

Labor  Management  Forums  and  Pre-decisional  Involvement  (PDI).  Executive  Order 13522,  Creating  Labor-Management  Forums  To  Improve  Delivery  of  Government  Services, December  9,  2009,  requires  the  Air  Force,  to  the  extent  permitted  by  law,  establish  labor management forums at the level of recognition (e.g. installation level), to help identify problems and  propose  solutions  to  better  serve  the  public  and  agency  mission.  The  use  of  labor management forums benefits managers, unions, and employees. Disputes may be resolved more quickly  and  earlier  than  in  other  dispute  resolution  processes.  Litigation  and  other  costs  are lower, and further complaints are avoided as parties learn to communicate better with each other. In  addition,  the  labor  management  forum  is  less  adversarial  than  other  processes  available  for resolving disputes. This leads to more creative solutions and the parties are more satisfied with the  results.  Pre-decisional  involvement  is  a  tool  to  share  information,  ideas,  concerns,  and options early in the decision-making process.  PDI  does not  eliminate bargaining or other labor obligations under the Statute. Installations that are currently utilizing labor partnerships or labor-management  committees  for  this  purpose  may  continue  to  do  so  in  compliance  with  the Executive Order. 3.3.  Strike,  work  stoppage,  slowdown,  or  picketing  is  prohibited.  It  is  an  unfair  labor practice for labor organizations to call, or participate in, a strike, work stoppage, or slowdown, or picketing  of  an  agency  in  a  labor-management  dispute  if  such  picketing  interferes  with  the agency’s  operations  (5  USC  7116).  When  such  actions  are  threatened  or  occur,  management officials and supervisors must immediately notify the CPO, who, in turn, notifies the SJA. (T1). The CPO notifies LRO to coordinate with LLFSC. The CPO and SJA advise management on a course of action given the facts of the situation. 3.4.  Union organizing.  The Statute provides that an agency shall recognize a labor organization as the  exclusive representative of  employees in  a bargaining unit, if that  organization has been selected as the representative by a majority of the unit's employees who voted in a secret ballot election. (T0). 14 AFI36-701  6 APRIL 2017 3.4.1.  In order for a union to represent employees, it must first file a petition with the FLRA. That petition must establish that at least 30% of the employees in the proposed  unit wish to be represented by the union as evidenced by their signatures, and that the unit is appropriate. (T0).  To be appropriate, a unit must (T0): 3.4.1.1.  Demonstrate a community of interest; 3.4.1.2.  Promote effective dealings with the agency; and 3.4.1.3.  Promote the efficiency of agency operations. 3.4.2.  Employees  already  represented  by  a  union  may  petition  the  FLRA  to  be  represented by another union or to be unrepresented. A petition must be filed with signatures of at least 30% of the employees in the unit asserting that the exclusive representative is no longer the representative of a majority of unit employees. Provided at least one year has elapsed since a representation election was conducted, the FLRA will hold an election and representation (or lack  thereof)  will  be  determined  by  a  majority  of  the  ballots  cast.  A  negotiated  agreement between labor and management bars another union from seeking to represent the bargaining unit until shortly before the expiration of the existing negotiated agreement. At that time (not more than 105 or less than 60 days prior to the expiration of an agreement of 3 years or less), the FLRA will consider a petition timely if filed by a rival union. (T0). 3.4.3.  Petitions may be filed to amend or clarify the description of a bargaining unit (e.g., if a reorganization changes the name of the activity), to consolidate two or more bargaining units, or  to  determine  if  individual  employees  are  included  in  the  bargaining  unit.  It  is  strongly recommended  that  activities  file  these  latter  types  of  petition  upon  any  organizational changes  which  impact  on  the  bargaining  unit's  description.  Activities  must  coordinate  with the LLFSC before filing a clarification petition. (T1). 3.4.3.1.  Where  DoD  components  are  co-located,  units  should  not  cover  more  than  one component (e.g. Air Force and Navy or Army employees). 3.5.  Representation  Proceedings  (5  CFR  Part  2422).  When  the  installation  or  MAJCOM receives  a  representation  petition  from  the  FLRA  Regional  Director,  it  must  notify  the  LLFSC immediately  and  forward  a  copy  of  the  petition  to  that  office  within  two  workdays.  (T1).  The LLFSC  assigns  a  management  representative  to  the  case  and  notifies  the  Regional  Director, FLRA,  of  such  assignment.  The  assigned  representative  issues  or  coordinates  on  any  further management correspondence concerning the case. AFI36-701  6 APRIL 2017 15 Chapter 4 MANAGEMENT RIGHTS 4.1.  Management Decision Making Authority.  Management rights are those areas over which management exercises exclusive decision-making authority as spelled out in 5 U.S.C 7106. 4.2.  Reserved Rights.  Reserved rights are nonnegotiable; however, management must bargain, upon  request,  over  the  procedures  it  will  use  in  exercising  these  rights  and  on  appropriate arrangements for employees adversely affected by the exercise of such rights. (This is commonly referred to as impact and implementation (I&I bargaining)). For example, in a reduction-in-force, the  decision  to  RIF  is  a  management  right,  but  outplacement  or  other  assistance  for  displaced employees are negotiable issues. (T0). Reserved rights include: 4.2.1.  To  determine  the  mission,  budget,  organization,  number  of  employees,  and  internal security practices of the agency. 4.2.2.  To  hire,  assign,  direct,  layoff,  and  retain  employees  in  the  agency,  or  to  suspend, remove, reduce in grade or pay, or take other disciplinary action against such employees. 4.2.3.  To  assign  work,  to  make  determinations  with  respect  to  contracting  out,  and  to determine the personnel by which agency operations shall be conducted. (T0). 4.2.4.  To  make  selections  for  appointments  from,  among  properly  ranked  and  certified candidates for promotion; or any other appropriate source; and 4.2.5.  To  take  whatever  actions  may  be  necessary  to  carry  out  the  agency  mission  during emergencies. 4.3.  Permissive  Rights.  Management  may  bargain  permissive  subjects,  but  is  not  statutorily required to do so. 4.3.1.  The  numbers,  types,  and  grades  of  employees  or  positions  assigned  to  any organizational subdivision, work project, or tour of duty, or on the technology, methods, and means of performing work. 4.3.2.  Procedures which management officials of the agency will observe in exercising any authority under this section (T0); or 4.3.3.  Appropriate  arrangements  for  employees  adversely  affected  by  the  exercise  of  any authority under this section by such management officials. 4.3.4.  Although  the  law  does  not  mandate  bargaining  over  permissive  management  rights, once  the  parties  include  such  rights  in  the  CBA,  they  are  enforceable  for  the  life  of  the agreement. Contact your LRO and LLFC for questions on mandatory and permissive subjects of bargaining. 16 AFI36-701  6 APRIL 2017 Chapter 5 NATIONAL CONSULTATION RIGHTS (NCR) 5.1.  Legal  Requirement  for  Consultation.  Section 7113 of the Statute requires the Air Force to consult with labor organizations afforded National Consultation Rights. Any issue relating to a labor  organization’s  eligibility  for,  or  continuation  of  national  consultation,  is  subject  to determination  by  the  FLRA.  (Refer  to  Headquarters  Operating  Instruction  (HOI)  36-6  for specific procedures for conducting NCR.) 5.2.  Matters Subject to Consultation.  The Air Force informs labor organizations granted NCR of  any  substantive  change  in  conditions  of  employment  proposed  by  AF  that  are  applicable  to field  activities.  Conditions  of  employment  means  personnel  policies,  practices,  and  matters (whether  established  by  rule,  regulation,  or  otherwise)  affecting  working  conditions  of bargaining  unit  employees.  (T0).  For  example,  if  an  Air  Force  organization  proposed  an Instruction  changing  the  safety  requirements  for  flight  line  employees;  it  would  constitute  a change  in  working  conditions.  The  Air  Force  need  not  provide  national  consultation opportunities where it has already been done by the Department of Defense, unless the Air Force proposes supplemental policies or programs. 5.3.  National  Consultation  Rights  .  NCR  do  not  substitute  for,  nor  excuse,  an  installation  or activity  from  the  obligation  to  give  notice  and,  upon  request,  bargain  with  its  recognized  labor organization  to  the  extent  required  by  law  over  planned  changes  in  conditions  of  employment (i.e. impact and implementation bargaining). 5.4.  How the Air Force Accomplishes National Consultation. 5.4.1.  Each  directorate  or  equivalent  organization  level  in  HQ  USAF  is  responsible  for national  consultation  on  matters  within  its  jurisdiction.  All  memoranda,  with  attachments, will be coordinated through AF/A1CM prior to being sent to labor organizations. AF/A1CM will  provide  guidance  on  the  necessity  of  consultation  and  the  content  of  national consultation memoranda. (T0). 5.4.2.  The  office  of  functional  responsibility  (i.e.  the  proposing  organization)  drafts  and forward  national  consultation  memoranda  to  labor  organizations  to  include  the  name  and telephone  number  of  the  Air  Force  action  officer  to  who  questions  may  be  directed.  The office of functional responsibility maintains copies of signed/dated documentation reflecting compliance with these requirements. 5.4.3.  Timing  the  issuance  of  national  consultation  memoranda  to  labor  organizations granted  NCR  is  important.  Copies  should  be  provided  after  receipt  of  major  command  and HQ  USAF  coordination,  but  before  the  proposed  action  is  prepared  in  final  form  for certification. Labor organizations should be provided with a copy of the proposed changes in final draft form. Providing an action in final form to the unions would not meet the spirit and intent  of  consultation;  because  any  helpful  or  important  suggestions  or  comments  provided back to the Air Force may not be incorporated into the policy. 5.4.4.  A  reasonable  date,  no  less  than  30  calendar  days,  by  which  a  formal  reply  from  the labor organization is requested. Include a statement that if a reply is not received by that date, it  is  then  understood  that  the  labor  organization  has  no  comments  concerning  the  proposed AFI36-701  6 APRIL 2017 17 change.    Except  in  unusual  circumstances  when  the  time  factor  is  critical,  the  transmittal letter  will  provide  no  less  than  30  calendar  days  for  response  from  the  labor  organizations. (T1). 5.5.  A  labor  organization  may  request  a  meeting  to  discuss  the  proposed  change.  This request must be made within the comment period.  The office to which the request is made will promptly arrange the meeting. The office will carefully consider the labor organization’s views and comments and make an appropriate response either at the time of the meeting,  or at a later date in writing. This type of meeting does not alleviate the responsibility for, or take the place of, bargaining at the local level. (T1). 5.6.  If  a  response  is  not  received  by  the  specified  time  in  the  national  consultation memorandum, and an extension is not granted, the NCR obligation will be considered fulfilled and  the  proposed  change  may  be  implemented  subject  to  local  bargaining.  If  a  labor organization  with  NCR  submits  timely  views  or  recommendations,  the  office  of  functional responsibility will consider such views and recommendations prior to taking final action. Copies of  any  responses  from  labor  organizations  should  be  retained  with  copies  of  the  national consultation memorandum. (T1). 5.6.1.  The office of functional responsibility will inform each labor organization of the final action  taken  on  its  views  or  comments.  Unions  will  be  informed  before  implementation  of the  proposed  change.  Notification  will  include  a  brief  explanation  of  why  the  office  of primary responsibility did or did not incorporate the views or comments. (T1). 5.6.2.  Offices  of  functional  responsibility  will  keep  HQ  USAF/A1CP  informed  of consultation memo, labor organization responses, and any subsequent correspondence so that it may monitor the progress of such consultation and compliance with the labor statute. (T1). 18 AFI36-701  6 APRIL 2017 Chapter 6 DUTY TO BARGAIN 6.1.  Duty  to  Bargain.  The  following  list  provides  reasons  why  a  particular  proposal  may  fall outside management’s duty to bargain. This listing does not address whether a proposal is non-negotiable  (i.e.,  violates  management's  rights  or  government-wide  law,  rule  or  regulation).  If management  has  any  questions  regarding  whether  the  agency  has  a  duty  to  bargain  over  a proposal, it must contact the LRO who provides guidance on the matter. (T1). When necessary, the  LRO  coordinates  with  the  LLFSC  for  further  guidance.  Management  should  consider  the following questions when reviewing union proposals: 6.1.1.  Proposals directly affect non-bargaining unit employees' conditions of employment? 6.1.2.  Proposals  directly  affect  the  conditions  of  employment  of  employees  in  other bargaining units? 6.1.3.  Does  the  proposal  concern  matters  unrelated  to  conditions  of  employment  or  is  it outside of the working relationship? 6.1.4.  Is the subject matter of the proposal covered by (included in) the parties' agreement? 6.1.5.  Did the parties previously negotiate over the proposal and elect not to include it in the negotiated agreement? 6.1.6.  Does the management-initiated change, which is the subject of the negotiations, have a de minimis effect on the bargaining unit employees? 6.1.7.  Has the union specifically waived its right to negotiate over the matter? 6.1.8.  Does the proposal limit management’s reserved rights (e.g., requiring management to notify the union 15 days prior to filing a ULP charge)? 6.1.9.  Was  management  authorized  to  take  the  action  it  is  proposing  by  the  terms  of  the parties' agreement? 6.1.10.  Does  a  law  or  government-wide  rule  or  regulation  provide  the  agency  sole  and exclusive discretion to take a particular action? 6.1.11.  Does the proposal conflict with agency or government wide rules and regulations for which there is a compelling need under 5 USC §7117. 6.2.  Past  Practice.  Management may need to bargain over a change to  a past practice. A past practice  is  defined  as  an  existing  practice,  sanctioned  by  use  and  acceptance  by  either management or union, which is not specifically included in the CBA. A past practice is found to exist when the following conditions are present: 6.2.1.  The practice is a condition of employment and/or working conditions. 6.2.2.  The  practice  consistently  practiced  over  an  extended  period  of  time.  There  is  no precise answer to what "consistently" means or how long is "an extended period of time." In determining  whether  a  past  practice  has  been  established,  management  should  consider  the frequency of the occurrence. 6.2.3.  Management is aware of the practice. AFI36-701  6 APRIL 2017 19 6.2.4.  Whether  or  not  a  practice  becomes  a  past  practice  is  determined  on  a  case-by-case basis.  Normally,  supervisors  cannot  unilaterally  stop  an  established  past  practice.  Rather, they give notification to the union of intent to terminate or modify the practice and afford the union  an  opportunity  to  bargain,  if  requested.  The  proposed  change  to  the  past  practice cannot  be  implemented  until  negotiations  have  been  completed.  One  exception  to  this  is  if the  past  practice  is  illegal.  In  that  case,  ceased  the  practice  immediately,  the  union  given notice of the change, the reason for its immediate termination and an opportunity to bargain over the impact and implementation of the change. 6.3.  De  minimis.  The  term  “de  minimis”  is  used  to  refer  to  a  change  in  conditions  of employment that is not significant enough to require bargaining.  Thus, if an issue is more than de minimis (important enough) the agency must bargain the issue. (T0). 6.3.1.  Any questions regarding the application of the de minims test should be referred to the LRO  for  guidance.  If  additional  guidance  is  required,  the  LRO  contacts  the  LLFSC  for assistance. 20 AFI36-701  6 APRIL 2017 Chapter 7 COLLECTIVE BARGAINING/NEGOTIATIONS 7.1.  Formal  Negotiations.  The  formal  phase  of  contract  negotiations  begins  when  the  union requests its first meeting with management to discuss a written contract, or submits its contract proposals; management requests a meeting with the exclusive representative to discuss a written contract or submits its contract proposals; or within the time specified in the existing CBA, either party notifies the other of its intent to renegotiate the existing contract. 7.2.  Methods.  Negotiations  typically  are  accomplished  using  one  of  two  methods  (or  a combination). 7.2.1.  Interest  Based  Bargaining.  This  is  a  joint  effort  approach  to  address  the  interests  of both  management  and  the  union.  Both  sides  seek  to  find  mutual  solutions  to  problems.  If using an interest based approach, it is recommended to have joint labor-management training on the interest based bargaining process. Review the local CBA for agreed upon procedures. 7.2.2.  Position  Based  Bargaining.  Both  management  and  the  union  submit  proposals  and then  debate  why  their  proposals  are  better  than  the  other  side's.  Each  side  is  interested  in winning  the  argument  and  obtaining  their  language,  regardless  of  the  parties'  long  term relationship. 7.3.  Process.  The  negotiating  process  is  designed  to  promote  the  balancing  of  rights  and interests of employees and the union with those of management. 7.3.1.  Negotiating  with  the  labor  union  occurs  at  various  times  and  for  different  reasons. Formal  negotiations  result  in  a  written  CBA  signed  by  both  management  and  the  union establishing  various  personnel  policies,  practices,  and  conditions  of  employment.  The agreement  is  distributed  to  everyone  at  the  installation  affected  by  its  application.  The document  may  be  referred  to  as  the  contract,  the  collective  bargaining  agreement  or  the labor-management  negotiated  agreement.  The  agreement  defines  when  re-negotiations commence and/or automatic renewal occurs. 7.3.2.  In these cases, when an agency decides to make changes to conditions of employment during the life of an agreement or when there is no agreement, two types of negotiations may result; substantive negotiations on the decision itself or I&I bargaining. I&I bargaining occur when management's proposed change falls within management rights. 7.4.  Condition of Employment.  The first consideration is whether the matter is a condition of employment.  Conditions  of  employment  are  personnel  policies,  practices  and  matters  affecting working  conditions.  If  a  matter  is  not  a  condition  of  employment,  there  is  no  obligation  to bargain over it. Excluded from the definition of conditions of employment are policies, practices or  matters  related  to  prohibited  political  activities,  the  classification  of  any  position,  or  other matters specifically provided for in Federal Statute 5 USC 7103(a)(14). 7.5.  Contracts.  A CBA is a binding document on the bargaining unit employees, the union and management.  It  is  in  everyone's  best  interest  to  assure  that  the  terms  of  the  agreement  are enforced  and  that  disputes  over  the  application  and  meaning  of  the  agreement  are  resolved quickly and at the lowest practical level. It is important to take detailed minutes of negotiations. AFI36-701  6 APRIL 2017 21 7.6.  Language.  Contracts should not contain vague or subjective terms that are open to various interpretations  depending  on  the  reader's  perceptions  and  experience.  For  example,  the  terms "reasonable," "short duration," “fair and equitable,” “normally” are subjective terms that should be avoided. 7.6.1.  If management and the union are unable to resolve a dispute due to contract language, the  matter  can  be  raised  under  the  parties'  negotiated  grievance  procedure.  All  negotiated grievance procedures provide for binding arbitration as a final step to the process. Here, an outside neutral party, the arbitrator, decides for the parties what the contract provision means and how it is to be implemented. Resolving the matter locally, without outside intervention, is the best solution. The parties are more likely to accept, and be responsible for, a solution they helped craft. An outside imposed solution may not please either side. 7.6.2.  Reopener  Negotiations  for  Changes  in  Law.  If  there  is  a  change  to  a  law  (e.g.,  Fair Labor  Standards  Act,  Family  Medical  Leave  Act)  the  parties  are  required  to  reopen  the contract and negotiate to remove any conflicts from the CBA. The parties should refer to the reopener procedures in their respective agreement to facilitate that process. 22 AFI36-701  6 APRIL 2017 Chapter 8 AGENCY HEAD REVIEW 8.1.  Air  Force  Labor  Agreements.  The  provisions  of  7114(c)  provide  for  AHR  through DCPAS of any agreement reached through collective bargaining.  If resolution of an individual grievance results in modification of the CBA, then that part of the settlement altering the CBA is reviewable as the CBA may only be changed through collective bargaining (whether it takes the form  of  a  settlement  or  other  format).    Agreements  not  requiring  AHR  review  are  settlement agreements resolving individual grievances that do not alter the CBA. 8.1.1.  DCPAS  will  return  AHR  notification  to  management  and  union  of  approval  or disapproval and identify specific reasons for disapproval. (T0). 8.1.2.  DCPAS  disapproval  means  the  entire  contract  is  disapproved,  unless  there  is  a provision  in  the ground  rules or other agreement that the contract  will go into effect  minus any  disapproved  provisions,  or  the  parties  execute  a  subsequent  agreement  to  implement those provisions not specifically disapproved.  If disapproved, the union can challenge those determinations by  filing  a negotiability  petition or an ULP charge with  the FLRA. DCPAS acts as the agency representative for any FLRA proceedings initiated by the disapproval of an agreement on agency head review. 8.1.3.  If  disapproved,  the  parties  may  agree  to  go  back  and  renegotiate  disapproved provisions or exclude those provisions from the contract. 8.2.  Negotiated agreements subject to Agency Head Review include  . 8.2.1.  Master Labor Agreements 8.2.2.  CBAs 8.2.3.  Ground Rules 8.2.4.  Memorandums of Understanding (MoU) 8.2.5.  Memorandums of Agreement (MoA) 8.2.6.  Local  Agreement  subject  to  a  national  or  other  controlling  agreement  at  a  higher organizational  level  will  be  reviewed  pursuant  to  the  procedures  of  the  controlling agreement.  Where no such procedures are contained in the controlling agreement, the local agreement will be reviewed pursuant to the AHR procedures. (T0). 8.2.7.  Settlement Agreements if the agreement alters the terms and conditions of a CBA. 8.3.  When Agency Head Review occur. 8.3.1.  Upon execution of ground rules 8.3.2.  Upon execution of any new labor agreements 8.3.3.  Upon execution of term or renegotiated contracts 8.3.4.  Upon rollover or “automatic renewal” of agreements 8.3.5.  Upon execution of mediation or impasse language AFI36-701  6 APRIL 2017 23 8.3.6.  Upon  execution  of  a  settlement  agreement  if  a  settlement  agreement  alters  the  terms and conditions of a CBA. 8.4.  Documents. When submitting a labor agreement to DCPAS, include: 8.4.1.  A copy of the agreement; 8.4.2.  A copy of the signature page with the date of execution and all signatures required to finalize the agreement; 8.4.3.  Contact  information  for  management  (CPO  or  LRO)  and  union  representative  to include official mailing address, email, and phone number; 8.4.4.  OPM Form 913B. 8.5.  Ratification.  Unions  may  have  a  similar  review  process  in  place,  known  as  ratification, though it’s not  required  by Statute. The  ratification process  must be completed prior to  agency head review. (T0). 8.6.  Timeliness.  Agency  head  review  must  be  accomplished  within  30  days  from  the  date  the agreement  is  executed  by  the  Commander  and  the  Union  President.  (T0).  If  not  approved  or disapproved  by  DCPAS  within  that  time,  the  agreement  goes  into  effect  the  31st  day  after execution  (excluding  provisions  contrary  to  law  or  government-wide  regulation).  Delays  in submitting agreements reduce DCPAS’s time to provide a thorough review. 8.7.  Rollover  or  Automatic  Renewal.  Agreements  containing  a  “rollover”  or  “automatic renewal” clause are subject  to  AHR in  accordance with  5 USC7114(c)(1).  It  will help  you and future  parties  to  include  AHR  as  part  of  the  renewal  process  in  your  contract.  Typically,  the contract  provides  for  a  105-60  day  open-window  prior  to  automatic  renewal  of  the  agreement. During that time, either party may request to reopen the agreement for negotiation.  LROs should review contracts prior to rollover or automatic renewal to determine the need for revision or to incorporate  MoAs.  LROs  are  required  to  further  obtain  LLFSC  legal  review  of  the  contract  at least 90 days prior to automatic renewal or rollover of CBAs. 24 AFI36-701  6 APRIL 2017 Chapter 9 FORMAL DISCUSSIONS 9.1.  Obligation.  Management has a positive obligation to invite the union to attend any formal discussion between one or more representatives of the agency and one or more employees in the bargaining  unit  or  their  representatives  concerning  any  grievance  or  any  personnel  policy  or practices or other general condition of employment. 9.2.  Formal  Discussion  or  Meetings.  For  a  meeting  to  be  considered  a  formal  discussion,  it must include one or more representatives of the agency (e.g., supervisors, management officials, or  attorneys);  and  one  or  more  employees  in  the  bargaining  unit  or  their  representatives.  The discussion must be formal  in  nature (e.g., a meeting  called by management  to  introduce  a new work  schedule  policy).  A  meeting  does  not  become  a  formal  discussion  unless  the  subject concerns  an  individual's  grievance,  a  personnel  policy  or  practice,  or  general  conditions  of employment. (T0). The following discussions or meetings may constitute formal discussions: 9.2.1.  A discussion between management and a grievant relating to a grievance is a formal discussion.  (Presently,  the  Authority  considers  formal  EEO  complaints  as  grievances  for purposes of formal discussions.) The union must be invited to attend even if the employee is representing him or herself in the negotiated grievance proceeding and the grievant does not want the union to attend. (T0). 9.2.2.  Discussions with bargaining unit employees about general conditions of employment or personnel policies and practices. The following discussions or meetings are not considered formal discussions: 9.2.3.  Normal shop talk 9.2.4.  Performance evaluation discussions 9.2.5.  Meetings discussing work projects (e.g., weekly staff meetings) 9.2.6.  The FLRA has indicated certain factors it looks at in determining whether a meeting was a formal discussion: 9.2.6.1.  Whether  the  individual  who  held  the  discussion  is  a  first-level  supervisor  or  is higher in the management hierarchy (the higher the level, the more a formal discussion is indicated); 9.2.6.2.  Whether any other management representatives attended; 9.2.6.3.  Where the individual meeting took place (i.e., in the supervisor's office, at each employee's desk, or elsewhere); 9.2.6.4.  How long the meeting lasted; 9.2.6.5.  How  the  meeting  was  called  (i.e.  with  formal  advance  written  notice  or  more spontaneously and informally); 9.2.6.6.  Whether a formal agenda was established for the meeting; 9.2.6.7.  Whether each employee's attendance was mandatory; and AFI36-701  6 APRIL 2017 25 9.2.6.8.  The  manner  in  which  the  meeting  was  conducted  (i.e.,  whether  the  employee's identity and comments were noted or transcribed). 9.2.7.  The above list provides indicators of a formal discussion, they need not all be present for the FLRA to find a meeting was a formal discussion. The FLRA looks at the totality of the  circumstances  and  not  just  any  single  factor  in  determining  if  there  was  a  formal discussion. 9.2.8.  Prior to scheduling a meeting with the employee and the union, the supervisor should contact the LRO to verify if the meeting is a formal discussion. 9.2.8.1.  If  the  meeting  meets  the  definition  of  a  formal  discussion,  management  must invite the union to attend. Having a shop steward, who works in the office, at the meeting in  his  or  her  role  as  an  employee,  does  not  meet  this  obligation.  Rather,  the  supervisor must invite the union to the meeting with the union being free to designate whom it wants to act as its representative. (T0). 9.2.8.2.  The  union  is  allowed  to  participate  in  formal  discussions  by  raising  questions, comments or concerns, but it cannot disrupt the meetings. 9.3.  Weingarten Rights 9.3.1.  Another  statutory  right  involves  meetings  with  employees  in  connection  with  an investigation and the employee requests union representation. This provision is often referred to as employees' "Weingarten" rights, based on a 1975 Supreme Court decision. The Statute establishes  three  conditions  that  are  required  to  be  met  for  a  meeting  to  be  considered  a "Weingarten" meeting: 9.3.1.1.  One  or  more  agency  representatives  are  examining  (questioning)  a  bargaining unit employee in connection with an investigation; 9.3.1.2.  The  employee  reasonably  believes  that  the  examination  may  result  in disciplinary action against the employee; and 9.3.1.3.  The employee requests union representation. 9.3.2.  Once all three conditions have been met, supervisors may generally not continue the examination  without  allowing  the  employee  his  or  her  representation.  Specifically,  the supervisor's options under these circumstances are: 9.3.2.1.  Grant  the  employee  request  allow  the  employee  to  contact  the  union representative; or the supervisor notify the union that a meeting to examine a bargaining unit  employee  is  going  to  take  place  and  that  the  employee  has  requested  union representation.  The  local  CBA  may  also  contain  a  provision  union  notification.  If  the union  attends  the  meeting,  they  are  allowed  to  make  relevant  comments  but  cannot disrupt the meeting nor can it answer the questions posed to the employee; 9.3.2.2.  Discontinue the interview and rely on evidence already available or information obtained from other sources; or 9.3.2.3.  Offer  the  employee  a  clear  choice  to:  a)  continue  the  interview  without representation, or b) have no interview. 26 AFI36-701  6 APRIL 2017 9.3.3.  "Weingarten" rights are not applicable when management issues a disciplinary action since management is not asking any questions. Additionally, the "Weingarten" right does not come  into  play  when  engaging  in  performance  counseling  as  this  does  not  concern disciplinary matters but, rather, performance issues. 9.3.4.  Management,  usually  the  installation  labor  relations  specialist,  is  responsible  for annually  notifying  employees  of  their  "Weingarten"  rights.  This  can  be  accomplished  by desk  drops,  notices  in  the  installation  paper,  etc.  The  "Weingarten"  rights  are  not  like "Miranda"  rights  in  that  management  is  not  obligated  to  inform  employees  of  their  rights each  time  before  questioning  them.  Refer  to  the  CBA  for  any  requirements  for  individual notification. AFI36-701  6 APRIL 2017 27 Chapter 10 OFFICIAL TIME 10.1.  Official Time to Perform Representational Functions.  Official time must be granted to employees  representing  a  labor  organization  when  engaged  in  collective  bargaining,  to  include attendance at impasse proceedings (5 USC 7131(a)). (T0). 10.1.1.  Official time cannot be granted for internal union business, such as, soliciting union membership and voting or campaigning for internal union elections (5 USC 7131(b)). 10.1.2.  The  FLRA  can  authorize  official  time  for  employees  representing  the  union  in  any phase of proceedings before the Authority (5 USC 7131(c)). 10.1.3.  Official  time  may  be  granted  for  other  reasons  (non-statutory  or  “contractual”)  as dictated  by  the  parties’  CBA,  or  through  a  past  practice.  The  time  granted  must  be reasonable,  necessary,  and  in  the  public  interest.  Examples  of  non-statutory/contractual official  time  include  representational  functions  associated  with  grievances  and  arbitration hearing,  preparation  for  negotiations,  and  attendance  at  labor-management  committee meetings. (T0). 10.1.4.  Official  time  requests  are  raised  to  the  union  official's  first-line  supervisor  or authorizing  official.  In  evaluating  requests,  consideration  should  be  given its reasonableness, the amount of time requested, past practices of allowing time, the time of day it  is  to  be  used,  availability  of  the  staff  to  accomplish  the  mission,  contractual  obligations, etc.  Supervisors  monitor  the  amount  of  official  time  used.  If  a  supervisor  fails  to  ensure proper  usage  of  official  time  by  the  union  officials,  he/she  may  find  that  a  past  practice  of extensive  official  time  usage/accounting  has  occurred.  When  monitoring  the  use  of  official time, supervisors are cautioned not to interfere with the protected rights of the union stewards and employees. to 10.1.5.  In the event the union official’s official business cannot be concluded within the time approved  for  official  time,  the  union  official  will  contact  their  immediate  supervisor  and request  additional  time.  If  the  immediate  supervisor  denies  the  verbal  request  based  on  the needs of the mission, the union representative and the supervisor will seek mutual agreement on an alternate time for absence. (T3). 10.1.6.  If  a  supervisor  has  a  question  as  to  the  appropriateness  of  official  time  being requested, contact the LRO for guidance. 10.1.7.  Arbitrary disapproval of request for official time could result in a ULP filed against the agency. 10.1.8.  An  employee  may  not  represent  other  employees  who  are  members  of  another bargaining unit on official time. 10.2.  Recording  Official  Time.  The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) requires federal agencies  to  record  or  account  for  official  time  for  employee  representational  activities.  This requirement is not limited solely to activities specifically required by the Statute. OPM uses this data in reports to Congress and in labor studies. Employees are required to record their official 28 AFI36-701  6 APRIL 2017 time  on  the  appropriate  Time  and  Attendance  form  or  in  an  automated  time  and  attendance system. Supervisors approve official time in 15-minute increments. AFI36-701  6 APRIL 2017 29 Chapter 11 REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION 11.1.  Requests  for  Information.  It  is  Air  Force  policy  to  bargain  in  good  faith  and  provide union  representatives  with  information  reasonably  necessary  to  represent  employees  in accordance  with  AFPD  36-7,  Employee  and  Labor-Management  Relations;  and  the  Federal Service  Labor  Management  Relations  Statute.  As  part  of  this  effort,  management  has  an obligation to furnish information requested, which is reasonably necessary to carry out employee representational duties, to the extent not prohibited by law. 11.1.1.  The  union  is  responsible  for  articulating  a  particularized  need  for  the  requested information.    In  order  to  expedite  the  process,  Management  may  ask  for  clarifying information in determining if the union has met the particularized need standard. 11.1.2.  Management will  inform  the union  whether the information requested is  granted or denied  and  the  reason  for  disapproval.  Unless  otherwise  negotiated  in  a  bargaining agreement,  the  information  is  required  to  be  provided  in  a  timely  manner  which  should  be determined  based  on  each  individual  request  for  information.  The  requested  information needs to be: 11.1.2.1.  Required in order for the union to adequately represent the bargaining unit. 11.1.2.2.  Normally  maintained  by  the  agency  in  the  regular  course  of  business. Management  is  not  required  to  create  documents  in  order  to  respond  to  a  request  for information. 11.1.2.3.  Reasonably  available  and  necessary understanding and negotiation of subjects within the scope of collective bargaining. full  and  proper  discussion, for 11.1.3.  Contact  the  LRO  for  assistance  in  responding  to  union  requests  for  information.  If further assistance is required, LRO coordinates with LLFSC for assistance. 30 AFI36-701  6 APRIL 2017 Chapter 12 UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICES 12.1.  Bases  for  Unfair  Labor  Practices.  A  ULP  charge  is  a  claim  that  management  or  the union  violated  provisions  of  the  Federal  Service  Labor-Management  Relations  Statue.  It  is  a ULP for management to: 12.1.1.  Interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise by the employee of his or his rights. 12.1.2.  Encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization by discrimination in connection with hiring, tenure, promotion, or other conditions of employment. 12.1.3.  Sponsor,  control  or  otherwise  assist  any  labor  organization,  other  than  to  furnish, upon request,  customary, and routine services  and facilities if the services and facilities are also furnished on an impartial basis to other labor organizations having equivalent status. 12.1.4.  Discipline or otherwise discriminate against an employee because the employee has filed a grievance, complaint, affidavit, or petition or has given any information or testimony under this chapter. 12.1.5.  Refuse to consult or negotiate in good faith with a labor organization as required by statue. 12.1.6.  Fail or refuse to cooperate in impasse procedures and impasse decisions as required by this chapter. 12.1.7.  Enforce any rule or regulation (other than a rule or regulation addressing prohibited personnel  practices)  which  is  in  conflict  with  any  applicable  CBA  if  the  agreement  was  in effect before the date the rule or regulations was prescribed. 12.1.8.  Failing to honor employees' automatic dues withholding requests. 12.1.9.  Otherwise fail or refuse to comply with any provision of the Statute. 12.2.  Refusing  to  Bargain  in  Good  Faith  .  This  includes  such  actions  as  management unilaterally making a change in the employees' conditions of employment without affording the union  an  opportunity  to  bargain.  This  charge  also  addresses  management's  failure  to  engage  in mid-term  bargain,  failing  to  furnish  information  to  the  union  that  they  are  entitled  to,  and bypassing  the  union  by  dealing  directly  with  the  bargaining  unit  employees  regarding  their conditions of employment. Management should contact the LRO for assistance with questions. 12.3.  Failing to Cooperate  . If, during negotiations, the parties reach impasse (that is, they are unable  to  reach  agreement  through  negotiations),  either  party  can  request  the  services  of  the FSIP. Prior to going to the FSIP the parties are strongly encouraged to engage in mediation. The FSIP  is  an  outside  agency  responsible  for  resolving  impasse  in  the  Federal  government.  The LLFSC represents the Air Force in all FSIP proceedings. Once timely invoked, management is required to participate in its proceedings and implement its decision. 12.4.  Compliance  with  Laws  and  Regulations.  If  a  DoD  or  government-wide  rule  or regulation  (e.g.,  5  CFR,  Federal  Travel  Regulations)  is  issued  after  the  effective  date  of  the parties'  CBA  and  the  two  conflict,  absent  some  specific  contract  language,  the  contract AFI36-701  6 APRIL 2017 31 supersedes  the  new  regulation  and  must  be  followed.  Once  the  labor  agreement  comes  up  for renewal, it must be brought into conformance with the current regulations. (T0). 12.5.  Most ULPs can be avoided by a general understanding of the statutory rights of the parties  and  by  fostering  a  positive  labor-management  relationship.  In  this  regard, consideration  should  be  given  to  negotiating  a  pre-ULP  resolution  period  (e.g.  30  days)  in  the parties' negotiated agreement. During this pre-ULP resolution period, the parties are expected to review, and hopefully resolve, the potential ULP charge. 32 AFI36-701  6 APRIL 2017 Chapter 13 GUIDELINES RELATED TO UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE CHARGES 13.1.  A  ULP  charge  can  be  filed  by  an  individual,  an  employee,  the  union  or management.  The  respondent  to  the  charges,  though,  is  either  management  or  the  union.  The vast  majority  of  ULP  charges  are  filed  by  the  union  against  management.  The  most  common ULP charge alleges that management failed to bargain in good faith, generally for not advising the union of proposed changes to conditions of employment, and unilaterally implementing the changes. 13.2.  Unfair  labor  practice  charges  are  filed  with  the  FLRA  Regional  Office.  Regional Directors, under the direction and supervision of the General Counsel investigates the charge to determine if there is sufficient evidence to warrant issuing a complaint. If a complaint is issued, a hearing  is  set  and  the  parties  go  before  an  administrative  law  judge  (ALJ)  with  the  General Counsel prosecuting. The ALJ will issue a decision either finding that a ULP was committed or dismissing the complaint. (T0). If either party is dissatisfied with the ALJ's decision, the case can be appealed to the FLRA. 13.3.  Throughout  all  the  above  steps,  efforts  should  be  undertaken  to  resolve  the  dispute informally,  either  through  local  efforts  or  with  the  assistance  of  the  Regional  Directors Office.  The FLRA have indicated that they will take all necessary steps to  assist  the parties in informally resolving ULP charges and related disagreements. (T0). 13.4.  The LLFSC attorneys act as agency representatives for ULPs filed by or on behalf of the  Air  Force  with  the  FLRA,  subject  to  the  exceptions  listed  in  Section  2.  3.7  of  this Instruction.    Prior  to  initiating  a  management  ULP,  an  installation  is  required  to  seek  approval from  the  LLFSC.   Installations CPOs should refer to  their MAJCOM’s  policies in  determining whether MAJCOM approval  is  also  needed to  initiate a management ULP. Any union-initiated ULPs  received  by  the  installation  are  required  to  be  forwarded  to  the  LLFSC  for  handling. LLFSC  counsel  will  be  deemed  agency  representatives  for  FLRA  or  FSIP  litigation,  unless otherwise indicated in this Instruction. (T2). 13.5.  ULP  Charges  Filed  Against  Installation  Management.  After  receiving  a ULP  charge, the  installation  LRO/CPO  furnishes  all  pertinent  information  to  LLFSC  or  appropriate  AFMC legal office. A representative is then assigned who issues or coordinates on any correspondence concerning the matter. 13.5.1.  The CPO or LRO provide civilian personnel  procedural  and technical  advice to  the designated representative in all phases of the case and attends the ULP hearing as a technical advisor.  The  designated  representative  represents  Air  Force  management  in  all  ULP proceedings brought by the FLRA against the US Air Force. 13.6.  Reporting  Guidelines.  All  ULP  charges  and  complaints  are  to  be  reported  immediately by  telephone  or  email  to  the  LLFSC  or  appropriate  AFMC  legal  office.  The  person  calling should provide the following information: 13.6.1.  The charge 13.6.2.  A summary of the allegations, dates and the management officials or other witnesses involved, with a description of any supporting evidence. AFI36-701  6 APRIL 2017 33 13.6.3.  A summary of the results of management’s investigation into the matter and efforts of the parties to resolve the dispute. 13.6.4.  Management’s  perception  of  the  issues,  its  position  on  the  merits  of  the  charge  or complaint, and its views of the possibility of settlement. 13.6.5.  The date the charge was served on management by the charging party. 13.6.6.  The date the charge or complaint was received from the FLRA regional office. 13.6.7.  Whether a grievance has been filed involving the same or similar matter. 13.6.8.  Whether a negotiability request has been filed involving the same or similar matter. 13.6.9.  The ULP must have occurred within the past 6 months. (T0). 13.7.  Decisions by the ALJ.  Within one workday of receiving the ALJ decision, the LLFSC or appropriate  AFMC  legal  office  designated  representative  sends  a  copy  to  the  installation  CPO. For precedential cases or cases with Air Force-wide implications, the CPOs are required to send a  copy  of  the  ALJ  decision  to  the  MAJCOM.  The  designated  representative  prepares  any exceptions  and  supporting  briefs  as  explained  in  FLRA  regulations,  coordinates  with  the  CPO, and files them with the FLRA. The representative sends informational copies to the installation and/or  to  the  MAJCOM  when  appropriate.  When  another  party  files  an  exception  with  the FLRA,  the  designated  representative  immediately  sends  copies  to  the  MAJCOM  and/or  the installation. If necessary, the designated LLFSC or appropriate AFMC legal office representative prepares the opposition and supporting brief, coordinates with the CPO, and files them with the FLRA  within  appropriate  time  limits.  The  representative  sends  information  copies  to  the MAJCOM or the installation. 34 AFI36-701  6 APRIL 2017 Chapter 14 NEGOTIATED GRIEVANCES 14.1.  Procedures.  The  following  sections  describe  processing  grievances  under  a  negotiated grievance procedure, arbitrating such grievances, and appealing of grievance arbitration awards. These  sections  also  discuss  organizational  and  functional  responsibilities  and  procedural requirements in such matters. 14.2.  Exclusivity  . The CBA includes procedures for settling grievances. Except as provided by section 7121(d) and (e) of the Statute, the grievance procedure negotiated by the parties will be the exclusive procedure for resolving bargaining unit employee grievances which fall within its coverage. (T0). 14.3.  Statutory Exclusions.  These exclusions are listed in section 7121(c) of the Statute. 14.4.  Negotiated  Exclusions.  The  negotiated  grievance  procedure  covers  any  grievable  issue unless there is an agreement to exclude it. The parties can agree to exclude any matter from the negotiated grievance procedure. If a party proposes to exclude an item, both parties are required to bargain on the matter.  If the parties are unable to reach an agreement on a proposed exclusion, follow  the  procedures  of  section  7119  of  the  Statute  for  the  resolution  of  collective  bargaining impasses, including referral to the FSIP. 14.5.  Representation.  A  labor  organization  granted  exclusive  recognition  in  a  collective bargaining  unit  has  the  statutory  right,  on  its  own  behalf  or  on  behalf  of  an  employee  in  that bargaining  unit,  to  present  and  process  grievances  under  the  terms  of  the  negotiated  grievance procedure. 14.5.1.  A bargaining unit employee who requests representation in pursuing a grievance may be  represented  only  by  the  recognized  labor  organization  or  by  an  individual  approved thereby. By law, bargaining unit employees retain the right to submit a grievance under the negotiated  procedure  on  their  own  behalf  and  without  representation.  In  that  situation, management gives the recognized labor organization the opportunity to be present during the grievance  proceedings.  Any  grievance  adjustment  with  bargaining  unit  employees representing themselves cannot violate the governing CBA. 14.5.2.  At  the  installation  level,  the  LRO  or  NAF  HRO  processes  grievances  under  the negotiated grievance procedure. The LRO or NAF HRO and SJA coordinate their actions in grievances that are appealed to arbitration. AFI36-701  6 APRIL 2017 35 Chapter 15 ARBITRATION PROCEDURES 15.1.  Questions  and  Issues.  The  initial  issue  in  arbitration  is  whether  a  matter  is  properly before the arbitrator. The issue can be either procedural  or substantive or both  and either party presents  it  as  a  threshold  question.  In  determining  whether  an  issue  is  not  able  to  be  arbitrated consider:  whether  the  subject  is  excluded  from  arbitration  by  contract  or  law;  whether  the grievance or arbitration request is untimely; any other issues that may make the issue improper for arbitration.  Unless  the CBA specifies otherwise, the arbitrator has the option to  decide the issue before hearing the  merits of the case, or to  defer  ruling on that threshold issue until  after hearing the merits. 15.2.  Where  an  individual  other  than  the  CPO  or  LRO  serves  as  management representative  in  arbitration  proceedings,  the  CPO  or  LRO  provides  policy  direction  and technical  advice  to  that  management  representative  in  all  phases  of  the  case.  In  preparing  for arbitration, the CPO and/or the LRO, or a designee, jointly with the management representative, develops the theory of the case, the arguments and the facts to be presented by management at the  hearing.  The  CPO,  the  LRO,  or  designee  also  attends  the  arbitration  hearing  as  a  technical advisor. Using an attorney from the installation SJA office in arbitration proceedings is a matter of local discretion. 15.3.  Submission  Agreements.  In  preparing  for  the  arbitration  hearing,  the  management representative  should  attempt  to  reach  agreement  with  the  labor  organization  on  the  issues. Present  the  issues  to  the  arbitrator  at  the  beginning  of  the  hearing.  Draft  the  submission agreement  carefully.  It  determines  the  scope  of  the  arbitrator’s  authority  and  jurisdiction. Without  a  submission  agreement  (or  some  provision  of  the  parties  CBA  which  restricts  the arbitrator’s authority or jurisdiction), arbitrators generally have the power to frame and describe the issues before them as they see fit. 15.4.  Dating  of  Arbitration  Awards.  Management representatives should specifically request that arbitrators date their awards no earlier than the date they place the awards in the mail; this should  allow  management  to  make  the  most  of  any  time  suspense  set  by  the  decision.  An installation  may  negotiate  such  requirement  in  the  parties  CBA  or  it  may  be  made  part  of  a submission agreement in a particular case. 15.5.  Special  Reporting  Requirements.  When  a  CPO  receives  an  award  (adverse  or otherwise) involving an action under 5 USC 4303 or 7512, immediately send two copies of the award  using  AF  Form  112  ARBITRATION  CASE  SUMMARY  to  AFPC  Civilian  Support Branch (AFPC/DP3FS)  and one copy to the LLFSC or appropriate AFMC legal office. 36 AFI36-701  6 APRIL 2017 Chapter 16 EXCEPTIONS TO ARBITRATION AWARDS 16.1.  Grounds  for  Appeal.  An  arbitration  award  is  normally  final  and  binding  on  the installation  and  labor  organization  involved.  Compliance  with  an  award  is  mandatory  and enforceable  under  section  7116  of  the  Statute.  However,  under  section  7122(a)  of  the  Statute, either party may appeal the award to the FLRA on the grounds that it is contrary to any law, rule, or regulation, or on other grounds similar to those applied by the federal courts in private sector labor-management relations. 16.2.  Installations  and  AFMC  may  write  and  file  the  exceptions  subject  to  coordination  and approval of the LLFSC and DCPAS.  The LLFSC may also file exceptions with the coordination and approval of DCPAS.  DCPAS can unilaterally withdraw any exceptions filed by the service components or DoD agencies. The FLRA has no jurisdiction to review arbitration awards which concern adverse actions taken under 5 USC 7512 or actions based on unacceptable performance covered  under  5  USC  4303.32.1.    MAJCOMs  may  set  additional  processing  requirements  for their installations for all arbitration awards. AFI36-701  6 APRIL 2017 37 Chapter 17 BARGAINING UNIT STATUS (BUS) CODES AND DUES WITHHOLDING 17.1.  BUS  Codes.  The  Federal  government  uses  BUS  codes  to  determine  the  bargaining  unit status  of  employees  and  provide  general  accounting  and  oversight.  They  represent  collective bargaining  rights,  entitlements  to  national  consultation  rights,  and  entitlements  to  official  time for  representation  under  federal  law.  The  Civilian  Personnel  Section  (CPS)  will  use  the  BUS code  in  all  personnel  actions  to  properly  identify  employees  in  bargaining  units  and  non-bargaining  units.  BUS  codes  are  annotated  on  the  position  description,  entered  in  DCPDS  and identified on Requests for Personnel Actions and Notification of Personnel Actions. (T0). 17.1.1.  The  BUS  code  is  a  derivative  from  the  Office  of  Labor  Management  Relations (OLMR)  121959  six  digit  identifier.  The  first  two  digits  of  the  OLMR  identify  the agency/component  to  which  the  employee  is  assigned  to.  The  remaining  four  digits  is  the number most commonly known as the BUS code. 17.1.2.  The code 8888 indicates the position is not eligible to be in a bargaining unit. These positions  are  designated  as  non-bargaining  based  on  statutory  exclusions  under  section 7112(b) of the Statute. 17.1.3.  The code 7777 indicates the position is  eligible to  be represented by  a union  but is not in a certified bargaining unit when a unit has not been successfully organized. 17.2.  Obtaining  a  BUS  Code.  When  a  new  bargaining  unit  is  certified,  the  LRO  submits  a request  for  a  BUS  code  from  the  AF/A1CM  with  the  Certification  of  Representative  and completed OPM  Form 913B. AF/A1CM submits documentation to  OPM for  BUS  code. When the new BUS code is received from OPM, AF/A1CM advises DCPAS, and Installation LRO or NAF  HRO  of  new  BUS  code.    Installation  will  initiate  personnel  actions  to  reflect  new  BUS code on impacted BUEs. (T0). 17.3.  Dues  Withholding.  Dues  withholding  is  not  required  by  the  Statute;  however,  it  is negotiable. Management and the union may decide to formalize dues withholding arrangements by  including  them  as  part  of  a  basic  negotiated  agreement  or  in  a  separate  memorandum  of understanding.  (See 5 USC §7115) 17.3.1.  Membership  of  the  union  and  dues  withholding  are  voluntary.  Employees  elect membership  by  submitting  a  SF-1187,  Request  for  Payroll  Deductions  for  Labor Organization Dues to the CPO. 17.3.2.  It  is  considered  an  unfair  labor  practice  for  a  union  to  deny  representation  to nonmembers or denying membership to an employee in  a bargaining unit for  failure to pay dues.      17.3.3.

Bargaining Unit—the bargaining unit is a group of employees with common interests who are represented by a labor union in their dealings with agency management. Collective  Bargaining  Agreement  (CBA)—an agreement entered into as a result of collective bargaining  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  the  Statute.  CBAs  set  forth  some  of  the  conditions  of employment  of  bargaining  unit  employees,  various  rights  and  obligations  of  the  parties  to  the agreement (i.e., the exclusive representative and the activity or agency), the negotiated grievance procedure, dues withholding provisions, reopeners, as well as the duration of the agreement. Conditions  of  Employment—those  personnel  policies,  practices,  and  matters  (whether established by rule, regulation, or otherwise) affecting working conditions of civilian employees. Covered by Doctrine—a doctrine under which management does not have to engage in midterm bargaining  on  particular  matters  because  those  matters  are  already  "covered  by"  the  existing agreement. Exclusive  Representative—the  union  that  is  certified  as  the  exclusive  representative  of  a bargaining unit of employees either by virtue of having won a representation election, or because it had been recognized as the exclusive representative before passage of the Civil Service Reform Act. Federal  Labor  Relations  Authority  (FLRA)—the  FLRA,  also  known  as  the  Authority,  is responsible  for  establishing  labor  policy  and  guidance  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  5 U.S.C.  Chapter  71.  The  Authority  prescribes  criteria  for  granting  national  consultation  rights and resolves labor disputes, including those related to Unfair Labor Practice complaints. AFI36-701  6 APRIL 2017 41 Federal  Mediation  and  Conciliation  Service  (FMCS)—an  independent  agency  that  provides mediators to assist the parties in negotiations.

Grievance—any  complaint--(A)  by  an  employee  concerning  any  matter  relating  to  the employment  of  the  employee;  (B)  by  any  labor  organization  concerning  any  matter  relating  to the  employment  of  any  employee;  or  (C)  by  an  employee,  labor  organization,  or  agency concerning--(I) the effect  or interpretation,  or a claim  of breach, of a CBA; or (ii) any claimed violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication of any law, rule, or regulation affecting conditions of employment. Impact and Implementation (I&I) Bargaining—even where the decision to change conditions of  employment  (including  established  practices)  of  bargaining  unit  employees  is  protected  by management`s reserved  rights, there is a duty to notify the union and, upon request, bargain on the procedures that management will follow in implementing its protected decision as well as on appropriate arrangements for employees expected to be adversely affected by the decision. Such bargaining is commonly referred to as "impact and implementation," or "I&I" bargaining, which is the most common variety of midterm bargaining. Labor  Organization—an organization composed (in whole or in part) of employees, in  which employees  participate  and  pay  dues,  and  which  has  as  a  purpose  of  dealing  with  an  agency concerning grievances and conditions of employment. Management Official—an individual who formulates, determines, or influences the policies of the agency. Midterm Bargaining—all bargaining that takes place while a CBA is in effect. National  Consultation  Rights  (NCR)—the  rights  afforded  certain  labor  organizations representing substantial numbers of agency employees. To fulfill these rights, the Air Force must inform  the  labor  organization  of  substantive  changes  in  conditions  of  employment,  give  the union  time  to  present  its  views,  consider  those  views,  and  give  the  labor  organization  written rationale for the final decision. (T-0). Official  Time—Official  time  is  the  time  granted  to  an  employee  to  perform  representational functions on behalf of the union. Official time is granted without charge to leave or loss of pay and is authorized only when the employee would otherwise be in a duty status. Official time is considered hours of work. Standards  of  Conduct  for  Labor  Organizations—standards  regarding  internal  democratic practices,  fiscal  responsibility,  and  procedures  to  which  a  union  should  adhere  to  qualify  for recognition.  The  Department  of  Labor  has  responsibility  for  making  known  and  enforcing standards of conduct for unions in the Federal and private sectors. 42 AFI36-701  6 APRIL 2017 Impasse—when  the  parties  have  reached  a  deadlock  in  negotiations  they  are  said  to  have reached an impasse in negotiations.
