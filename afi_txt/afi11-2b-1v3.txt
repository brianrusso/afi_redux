Mission  Planning  Responsibility.  Individual  aircrews,  unit  operations,  and  intelligence functions  jointly  share  responsibility  for  mission  planning.    The  Mission  Lead  has  the  final responsibility for the accuracy of mission planning. 2.4.  General Procedures: 2.4.1.  Aircrew  will  accomplish  sufficient  flight  planning to  ensure  safe  mission accomplishment,  to  include  fuel  requirements,  chart  preparation,  and  takeoff/landing  data using  any  certified  computer  based  mission  planning  system.    Until  planning  systems  are certified  for  fuel  computations,  mission  planners  will  cross-check  fuel  calculations  for accuracy. (T-3) 2.4.2.  Substitutions.  Unit operations supervisors (or higher) may make crew substitutions as long  as  the  substitute  crewmember  is  thoroughly  briefed  and  understands  all  aspects  of  the mission. 2.4.3.  Standards.  Aircrews  will  use  the  B-1  Mission  Standards  to  the  maximum  extent possible.  The B-1 Mission Standards do not replace established T.O.s or flight regulations.  The  OPR  for  the  B-1  Mission  Standards  is  the  77  Weapons  Squadron  (WPS).    Forward recommendations for change to the 77 WPS Director of Operations (DO). (T-3)   8  AFI11-2B-1V3  20 MARCH 2015 2.4.3.1.  Units  may  enhance/supplement  the  B-1  Mission  Standards  with  unit-specific standards  in  support  of  the  unit’s  mission.    The operational  commander  for  the  level  to which the standard applies is the approval authority. 2.4.3.2.  Operations Group Standardization and Evaluation (OGV) functions will review all  standards  for  standardization  and  compliance  with  AFI  11-series  guidance  and forward a copy to their parent MAJCOM/DRU/FOA. (T-2) 2.4.4.  B-1  Weapons  Attack  Guide  (WAG).    The  B-1  WAG  is  intended  to  aid  aircrews  in mission  planning  and  for  use  during  flying  operations.    It  does  not  relieve  aircrew  from compliance with established T.O.s or flight regulations.  Aircrew retain the responsibility of ensuring  information  referenced  from  the  B-1  WAG  is  current,  complete,  and  accurate  in accordance with  applicable sources.  The  OPR for the  B-1 WAG is  the  77 WPS.  Forward recommendations for changes to the 77 WPS/DO. 2.5.  Fuel Planning. 2.5.1.  Fuel  Conservation.    Aircrew  and  mission  planners  will  manage  aviation  fuel  as  a limited  commodity  and  precious  resource.    Aircrew  will  consider  fuel  optimization throughout  all  phases  of  mission  planning  and  execution.    Excessive  fuel  adds  to  aircraft gross weight and increases fuel consumption.  Aircrew should employ the following aviation fuel  optimization  measures  without  compromising jeopardizing mission/training accomplishment: (T-3) flight  safety  or 2.5.1.1.  Aircrew  and  mission  planners  will  optimize  flight  plans  and  flight  routing  for fuel efficiency. (T-3) 2.5.1.2.  Delay  engine  start  time  when  practical.    Minimize  aircraft  weight  through optimized fuel loads. 2.5.1.3.  Establish changes/cancellations to avoid unnecessary or unproductive flight time. procedures notification to ensure timely of  mission 2.5.1.4.  Minimize enroute delays and fly enroute airspeeds appropriate for efficiency. 2.5.1.5.  When cruise legs exceed 1 hour, aircrews should use the Fuel Center of Gravity Management  System  (FCGMS)  optimum  cruise  mode  and  attempt  to  fly  at  or  near  the optimum cruise altitude and angle of attack (AOA) to the maximum extent possible. (T-3) 2.5.1.6.  Aircrew  should  implement  in-flight  procedures  such  as  climb/descent  profiles and power settings for efficient fuel usage. (T-3) 2.5.2.  Table  2  1  lists  approved  estimated  fuel  flows  to  use  when  determining  fuel requirements.    Should  more  detailed  fuel  planning  be  required  refer  to  T.O.  1B-1B-1-1, Performance Data USAF Series B-1 Aircraft. (T-3) Table 2.1.

Briefing/Debriefing.  (T-3) 2.6.1.  All  crewmembers  will  attend  the  mission  briefing.    Mission  Leads  will  use  briefing guides as a reference for the preparation and presentation of the mission briefing.  Suggested briefing guides can be found in the AFTTP 3-3.B-1, Tactical employment – B-1.  Units may use  locally  developed  briefing  guides  in  lieu  of  suggested  briefing  guides.    Mission  Leads may  brief  items  listed  in  any  logical  sequence,  but  do  not  need  to  cover  specific  items  not pertinent to the planned mission. 2.6.2.  Mission Leads may brief items adequately covered in Standards as "standard." 2.6.3.  Mission  Leads  will  ensure  briefing  start  time  provides  adequate  time  to  discuss required briefing items depending on complexity of the mission and crew capabilities. 2.6.4.  Mission  Leads  are  responsible  for  presenting  a  logical  briefing,  which  will  promote safe,  effective  mission  accomplishment.    All  formation  flight  briefings  will  cover  flight member responsibilities, deconfliction contracts, mission priorities, and sensor management. 2.6.5.  Mission  Leads  will  brief  and  emphasize  obstacle/ground  avoidance  anytime  low altitude  operations  are  planned.    For  low  altitude  operations  over  water/featureless  terrain, emphasize minimum altitudes and spatial disorientation.  If low altitude weapon employment is  planned,  emphasize  weapon  release  parameters  including  planned  speed,  altitude,  fuse settings,  planned  track,  weapon  interval,  fragmentation  deconfliction,  and  time/track tolerances. Units will designate an OPR to maintain low altitude and weapon activity data. 2.6.6.  Mission Leads will brief an appropriate alternate mission for each flight if applicable.  The alternate mission must be less complex than the primary and should parallel the primary mission.  If not parallel, brief the specific mission elements that are different.  Mission Leads may modify mission elements/events  and brief them  airborne as long  as  flight  safety is  not compromised.  The Mission Lead will ensure all flight members acknowledge the changes.   10  AFI11-2B-1V3  20 MARCH 2015 2.6.7.  Step Brief.  Aircrew will accomplish a step-brief prior to stepping to the aircraft.  The Mission  Lead  will  ensure  all  crewmembers  are  briefed,  at  a  minimum,  on  current/forecast weather,  Notices  to  Airman  (NOTAM),  crew  requirements,  aircraft  configurations,  Top  3 interest items and any mission changes. (T-3) 2.6.8.  Deployed  Operations,  Exercise,  and  Mission  Plan  Fly-Fly  Briefings.    If  all  flight members  attend  an  initial  or  mass  flight  briefing,  the  Mission  Lead  on  subsequent  flights need brief only those items that have changed from the previous flight(s). 2.6.9.  Debriefing: The Mission Lead will thoroughly debrief the mission. Refer to AFTTP 3-3.B-1,  Combat  Aircraft  Fundamentals--B-1,  for  debrief  guidance.    At  a  minimum,  the debriefing  will  include  an  evaluation  of  the  mission  objectives,  desired  learning  objectives, lessons  learned,  execution  errors,  deconfliction  contracts,  in-flight  execution  of  flight member responsibilities, mission/tactical employment priorities, and sensor management. 2.7.  Chart Preparation: 2.7.1.  Planning.  Aircrew flying under Visual Flight Rules (VFR), inside Military Operating Areas  (MOA),  or  on  Military  Training  Routes  (MTR)  in  the  Continental  United  States (CONUS)  will  supplement  existing  mission  planning  materials  (e.g.  Chart  Update  Manual (CHUM), Flight Information Publications (FLIP) AP/1B, etc.) with either: (T-3) 2.7.1.1.  Mission  Planning  System  (MPS)  chart  with  the  following  overlay  options selected:  Airports/heliports,  airspace  boundaries,  airways,  MTR,  parachute  jump  and Special Use Area (SUA) boundaries. 2.7.1.2.  Sectional aeronautical charts.  Note: Use of sectional aeronautical charts in flight is not required. 2.7.2.  Aircrew flying outside CONUS will follow gaining MAJCOM, theater or host nation guidance  on  mission  planning.    If  no  guidance  exists,  use  the  best  charts  or  MPS  overlay options available to accomplish the requirements of paragraph 2.7.4 (T-2) 2.7.3.  Local  Area  Charts.    A  local  area  chart  is  not  required  if  aircrew  in-flight  guides include jettison areas and divert information and provides sufficient detail of the local area to remain in local MOA or other assigned areas. 2.7.4.  Low Altitude Charts.  On low altitude training flights, one member of the pilot team, the  Offensive  Systems  Officer  (OSO)  and  Defensive  Systems  Officer  (DSO)  will  carry  a chart.    The  chart  will  be  of  scale  and  quality  that  terrain  features,  hazards,  noise  sensitive areas,  and  chart  annotations  are  of  sufficient  detail  to  allow  individual  navigation  and  safe mission  accomplishment.    Annotate  charts  with  noise  sensitive  areas,  location  and dimensions of class B/C/D airspace, civil/military airfields, and other potential high-density traffic areas (e.g., parachute activity areas and ultra-light/hang glider/glider sites, etc.) within 5 nautical miles (NM) of any planned VFR route or airspace boundary.  Applicable airfield approach control frequencies in the vicinity of class B, C, and D airspace will be annotated and  briefed  on  all  such  flights.    In  addition,  annotate  and  brief  the  intersection  of  crossing Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) Military Training Routes (IR)/ VFR Military Training Routes (VR)  (if  applicable)  and  any  other  possible  areas  of  conflict.    Review  pilot’s  and  Weapon System Officer’s (WSO) low altitude charts for compatibility and accuracy. (T-3) AFI11-2B-1V3  20 MARCH 2015   11  2.7.4.1.  VR/IR  Charts.  Annotate  all  charts  with  headings,  maximum/minimum  route structure  altitudes,  minimum  safe  altitudes  (MSA),  and  route  abort  altitude  (RAA).    If MSA  changes  along  the  intended  route  of  flight  annotate  an  MSA  for  each  leg  of  the route.  If the aircrews uses a single MSA they will clearly annotate it on every page of the chart. (T-3) 2.7.4.2.  MOA/Restricted/Warning Area Charts.  Aircrew using a single MSA will clearly annotate  it  on  the  chart.    Aircrew  using  multiple  MSAs  or  local  MSAs  within    the operating  area  will  ensure  all  MSAs  and  associated  constructs  are  clearly  defined  and annotated on the chart. (T-3) 2.7.4.3.  MSAs  and  RAAs  will  be  a  minimum  of  1,000  feet  above  the  highest obstacle/terrain (rounded up to the next 100 feet) within the lateral limits of the route or operational area, but in no case less than 5 NM either side of planned route corridor. (T-3) 2.8.  Chemical, (CBRNE).  Attachment 3 contains procedures for operations in a CBRNE-threat environment. Radiological, Biological, Nuclear, High-Yield Explosive   12  AFI11-2B-1V3  20 MARCH 2015 Chapter 3 NORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES 3.1.  Air Refueling. 3.1.1.  Air refueling operations are authorized along published or special tracks/anchors.  In addition,  aircrew  may  conduct  en  route  refueling  (i.e.  “random  refueling”)  with  Air  Traffic Control  (ATC)  approval.    For  information  concerning  air  refueling  airspace,    rendezvous types,  and  air  refueling  operations  procedures,  refer  to  ATP-56(B),  Air-to-Air  Refueling; Federal  Aviation  Administration  JO  7610.4M,  Special  Operations;  FLIP  AP/1B,  Military Training Routes; and T.O. 1B-1B-1, Flight Manual USAF Series B-1 Aircraft. 3.1.2.  Military Assumes Responsibility for Separation of Aircraft (MARSA): 3.1.2.1.  MARSA between the tanker(s)  and the receiver(s) begins  when the lead tanker aircrew advises ATC they accept MARSA for the formation. 3.1.2.2.  After the lead tanker declares MARSA, ATC assigned course or altitude changes prior  to  the  rendezvous  completion  will  automatically  terminate  MARSA.    Once  the rendezvous  is  completed,  ATC  may  make  heading  and  altitude  assignments  with  the tanker’s concurrence and MARSA will remain in effect. (T-1) 3.1.2.3.  After  rendezvous,  receiver(s)  will  remain  within  3  miles  of  the  tanker  until MARSA is terminated. (T-1) 3.1.3.  Rendezvous (RV). 3.1.3.1.  RV  Delta  (Point  Parallel  Rendezvous).  Receiver  aircraft  shall  arrive  at  the  Air Refueling  Control  Point  (ARCP)  no  earlier  than  the  scheduled  Air  Refueling  Control Time (ARCT) -5 minutes and depart no later than ARCT +10 minutes.  If unable to meet timing  tolerance,  attempt  to  contact  a  unit  scheduler/duty  officer  for  a  new  rendezvous time.  If unable to schedule a new rendezvous time, air refueling is permitted provided all aircraft receive ATC clearance. (T-1) 3.1.3.2.  RV Golf (En Route Rendezvous).  Aircraft shall arrive at the Rendezvous Point ±5 minutes of the scheduled rendezvous time.  If unable to meet timing tolerance, attempt to contact a unit scheduler/duty officer for a new rendezvous time.  If unable to schedule a  new  rendezvous  time,  air  refueling  is  permitted  provided  all  aircraft  receive  ATC clearance.  Note: Aircrews must be aware arriving outside the  –5 / +10 minute window for RV Delta or the ±5 minute window for RV Golf may result in  a conflict  with  other aircraft scheduled in the refueling airspace.  If a conflict arises between two formations, the formation within their timing tolerance will take precedence. (T-1) 3.2.  Low Altitude Training.  Conduct low altitude training in specifically approved areas. 3.2.1.  Domestic  Low  Altitude  Military  Training  Routes  (MTR).    Refer  to  FLIP  AP/1B, Military Training Routes, for airspace restrictions and contact the airspace Point of Contact (POC) through the local airspace manager to ensure the most current information is used for planning. 3.2.2.  Route Criteria.  Lateral separation is preferred to over-flight of noise complaint areas. AFI11-2B-1V3  20 MARCH 2015   13  3.2.2.1.  TF/Visual  Contour  (VC)  minimum  altitudes  will  provide  at  least  200  feet clearance  above  man-made  obstructions  within  the  route  corridor  or  five  miles  of  the planned route, but in no case will be lower than the minimum altitude published in FLIP AP/1B,  Military  Training  Routes.    Where  surface  is  the  published  minimum  operating altitude  in  FLIP  AP/1B,  man-  made  obstructions  less  than  200  feet  above  ground  level (AGL) were not considered in route design. (T-3) 3.2.2.2.  For  routes  and  other  training  areas  not  covered  above,  aircrew  will  use  set clearance  planes  providing  at  least  200  feet  clearance  above  man-made  obstructions within the route corridor/planned routing or, they will avoid the obstruction by at least 2 miles laterally. (T-3) 3.2.3.  IR Training Activity:   Comply  with the  scheduling  requirements  of 3.2.3.1.  Scheduling. the  route originating/scheduling activity.  Confirm entry tolerances with the scheduling agency.  If the  originating/scheduling  activity  does  not  provide  entry  tolerances  aircrew  will  enter only  at  scheduled  time  ±2½  minutes.    If  the  aircrew  cannot  make  the  scheduled  entry within  ±2½  minutes,  they  may  use  subsequent  primary  or  alternate  entry  points/times provided the airspace has been scheduled and briefed. (T-1) 3.2.3.2.  Instrument  routes  are  one-way.    While  flying  an  IR  do  not  turn  more  than  90- degrees off of route centerline. (T-1) 3.2.4.  Hazardous Conditions.  Relay any safety hazard (e.g. icing, turbulence, thunderstorms, bird  concentrations  etc.)  through  a  Pilot  Weather Report  (PIREP)  to  the  controlling  agency and to any other aircraft operating in the area through flight service. 3.2.5.  Bird  Strikes.    Comply  with  Bird/Wildlife  Aircraft  Strike  Hazard  (BASH)  program guidance  IAW  AFI  91-202,  The  US  Air  Force  Mishap  Prevention  Program,  and  Air  Force Pamphlet  (AFPAM)  91-212,  Bird/Wildlife  Aircraft  Strike  Hazard  (BASH)  Management Techniques.    Generally,  the  hour  before  and  after  sunrise  and  sunset  presents  an  increased threat of a bird strike, with migration seasons posing a significant hazard at different times.  Units should check the Avian Hazard Advisory System (AHAS) (http://www.usahas.com), contact their base Civil Engineering wildlife expert, or Air Force Safety Center BASH team for further information on times of increased bird activity. (T-3) 3.2.6.  Weather Requirements.  Aircrew should attempt to update weather information prior to entering training airspace if they anticipate any significant weather changes. (T-3) 3.2.7.  Altitude  Variation.    Altitude  variation  is  the  difference  between  indicated  pressure altitude  with  a  local  (QNH)  altimeter  set  and  actual  (true)  altitude  above  mean  sea  level (MSL).    Pilot-to  Metro  Service  (PMSV)  can  provide  forecast  altitude  variation.  In  flight, aircrew  may  approximate  altitude  variation  by  taking  or  evaluating  an  altitude  calibration (ACAL)  and  comparing  MSL  altitude  to  Offensive  Avionics  System  (OAS)  altitude  (For example, a 2,420 MSL pressure altimeter reading and a 2,000 ft OAS altitude indicate a -420 ft altitude variation). Also, if the aircraft radar altimeter indicates less than 600 ft while at the MSA/RAA altitude variation is greater than -400 feet. 3.2.7.1.  In  an  IR  route  when  the  altitude  variation  exceeds  -400  feet  the  MSA/RAA altitude no longer provides safe terrain clearance.  Aircrews are not restricted during day   14  AFI11-2B-1V3  20 MARCH 2015 and Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC).  At night or in Instrument Meteorological Conditions  (IMC)  aircrews  may  fly  TF  without  using  MSA;  however,  if  an  aircrew requires flight at MSA (due to a flyup or mandatory  IFR leg) the aircrew will abort the route. (T-3) 3.2.7.2.  In SUA when the altitude variation exceeds -400 feet aircrews may continue low altitude  operations  if  they  can  raise  their  MSA  without  exiting  the  airspace.    Aircrews will increase their MSA by at least the amount of the altitude variation. (T-3) 3.2.8.  Low Altitude Navigation.  If aircraft position is uncertain in night/IMC, aircrew will maintain TF until they can clear the terrain in the direction of flight and then abort the route. (T-3) 3.2.9.  Combat Altimeter Setting. During day VMC, aircrews may compute, set, and maintain computed  true  altitude  in  the  aircraft  pressure  altimeters.    Enter  the  training  area  using  the latest  ATC/  Flight  Service  Station  (FSS)  altimeter  then  compute  a  combat  altimeter  setting after established at TF or VC altitudes. Reset altimeters using current ATC/FSS information before entering IMC and before climbing to MSA/RAA altitude. 3.2.10.  Abort  Procedures.  Aircrew  will  use  the  following  guidance  when  aborting  any  low altitude training area. (T-1) 3.2.10.1.  VMC Abort Procedures.  Maintain safe separation from the terrain and comply with VFR altitude restrictions. Squawk applicable (Identification, Friend or Foe/Selective Identification  Feature  (IFF/SIF))  modes  and  codes  and  attempt  to  contact  a  controlling agency.  If unable to maintain VMC, comply with the procedures in 3.2.10.2 3.2.10.2.  IMC  Abort  Procedures.    Immediately  climb  to,  or  above,  the  computed MSA/RAA  and  maintain  the  preplanned  ground  track.  If  necessary,  execute  lost wingman procedures.  If deviations from normal route/area procedures are required, or if the  MSA/RAA  is  higher  than  the  vertical  limits  of  the  route/area,  squawk  emergency.  Contact  the  appropriate  controlling  agency  and  obtain  an  IFR  clearance.    If  exit  from IMC is not possible and an IFR clearance cannot be immediately obtained, cruise at the appropriate VFR hemispheric altitude until clearance is received. 3.2.10.3.  Individual  Aircraft  Abort  Procedures.    If  an  individual  aircraft  aborts  during low  altitude  training,  that  aircraft  will  ensure  formation  deconfliction  and  immediately notify the flight of intentions. 3.2.10.4.  Multiple  Aircraft  Abort  Procedures.    If  the  entire  formation  must  abort  low altitude  training,  all  aircraft  will  immediately  establish  radio  contact  while  placing appropriate radars and air-to-air (A/A) Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN) to operate/on.  The  lead  aircraft  will  direct  altitude  separation,  headings,  and  airspeeds.    Establish positive  radar  and/or  visual  contact  before  the  formation  performs  any  climbing maneuver other than to establish immediate altitude separation and maintain a safe terrain clearance. 3.3.  Night  Vision  Goggle  (NVG)  Procedures.  While  both  pilots  on  NVGs  is  the  preferred employment  configuration,  there  are  no  restrictions  to  single  pilot  NVG  operations  when qualification level and/or NVG availability precludes dual pilot NVG operations. AFI11-2B-1V3  20 MARCH 2015   15  3.3.1.  During  mission  planning,  aircrew  will  review  lunar  illumination  and  elevation, anticipated  ground  light  sources,  weather  for  the  planned  route  of  flight,  and  consider weapons/expendable effects for their impact on NVG operations. (T-3) 3.3.2.  Each  crewmember  whose  duties  require  the  use  of  NVGs  will  preflight  their respective NVGs IAW T.O. 12S10-2AVS9-2, Technical Manual Image Intensifier Set, Night Vision  Type  AN/AVS-9,  and,  when  available,  use  the  Hoffman  ANV  20/20  or  equivalent infinity focusing device.  This device is preferred over an eye lane for NVG preflight. (T-2) 3.3.3.  Do not fly with NVGs unless the cockpit is modified with NVG compatible lighting. 3.4.  Formation. 3.4.1.  General.  Flight/Mission leads will establish, brief, and debrief the contract, roles, and responsibilities  and  execution  of  each  flight  member.    If  any  flight  member  cannot  fulfill their  basic  responsibilities,  contracts,  or  other  assigned  tasks,  they  will  immediately communicate  that  information  to  the  Flight/Mission  Lead.  Flight/Mission  Leads  will  task element  leads/wingmen  based  on  their  ability  to  fulfill  basic  responsibilities  and  other assigned tasks.  For additional formation considerations, reference AFTTP 3-3.B-1, Combat Aircraft Fundamentals – B-1, and AFTTP 3-1.B-1, Tactical Employment—B-1. (T-3) 3.4.1.1.  Flight/Mission Leads will brief a formation deconfliction/blind/get well plan for every  phase  of  flight  and  ensure  every  flight  member  understands  the  plan.    All  flight members are responsible for executing the briefed plan. (T-3) 3.4.1.2.  Wake  Turbulence  Awareness.    All  formation  members  must  understand  wake turbulence/wingtip vortices hazards associated with flying in formation. AFMAN 11-217 Volume 1, Instrument Flight Procedures, contains information on the characteristics and effects of wake turbulence. 3.4.2.  Authorized  B-1  Formations.    For  additional  guidance,  refer  to  AFTTP  3-3.B-1, Tactical Employment – B-1: 3.4.2.1.  Route/Observation.    The  Route/Observation  position  is  30  to  70  degrees  aft  of the lead’s or tanker’s 3/9 line with 150 to 1,000 foot aircraft separation. 3.4.2.2.  Fluid.  The Fluid position is 30 to 70 degrees aft of leads 3/9 line with 1,000 to 3,000  foot  aircraft  separation.    The  formation  envelope  is  a  “donut”  around  the  lead aircraft.    Aircrew  will  use  Fluid  for  those  situations  where  they  anticipate  moderate maneuver  potential  (e.g.,  holding  in  a  tactical  environment,  rejoins  during  departure, tactical recoveries, maneuvering around clouds or when striking an area target with near simultaneous time-over-targets (TOT)). (T-3) 3.4.2.3.  Wedge.  The Wedge position is 30 to 70 degrees aft of lead's 3/9 line with 3,000 feet to 3 miles separation. The formation envelope is a “donut” around the lead aircraft. 3.4.2.4.  Line Abreast (LAB).  The LAB position is 0 to 30 degrees aft of lead’s 3/9 line with  3,000  feet  to  3  NM  separation.    The  formation  envelope  is  a  “donut”  around  the aircraft. 3.4.2.5.  Trail.    The  Trail  position  is  aft  of  the  3/9  line  with  ½  to  3  NM  spacing.    Trail requires a minimum of 500 foot altitude separation if inside 1 NM.  Trail does not require altitude separation if aircraft remain separated by at least 1 NM.   16  AFI11-2B-1V3  20 MARCH 2015 3.4.2.6.  Stream.    The  Stream  position  is  flown  with  3-9  NM  separation.    During  low altitude, aircraft within a flight may fly different altitudes provided formation position is maintained.  If not flying the briefed altitude inform the formation. 3.4.3.  Ground/Taxi Operations. 3.4.3.1.  When ice, snow, or water is present on taxi surfaces, pilots will increase spacing and reduce taxi speeds as appropriate. (T-3) 3.4.3.2.  Every member of the flight will review and understand the takeoff data.  Pilots should place particular emphasis on takeoff and abort factors during abnormal situations such  as  a  wet  runway,  heavy  gross  weights,  and  abort  procedures  for  formation  flights.   (T-3) 3.4.4.  Takeoff.  The minimum takeoff interval from the same runway is 30 seconds or when the  previous  aircraft  in  the  formation  is  airborne,  whichever  occurs  first.  Abort  calls  are mandatory when any formation member aborts the takeoff. 3.4.5.  Departure: 3.4.5.1.  VMC.  Close to and maintain the pre-briefed formation.  No calls are required as long as the wingman maintains visual contact. 3.4.5.2.  IMC.  All aircraft will follow the Blind procedures in  paragraphs 3.4.8.2 until all  trailing  aircraft  establish  radar  and/or  visual  contact,  and  called  “Tied”  or  “Visual”.  After  that  point,  no  further  radio  calls  are  required.  If  radar  and  visual  contact  is subsequently lost, resume the Blind procedures. (T-3) 3.4.6.  Rejoins: (T-3) 3.4.6.1.  Mission  Leads  will  brief  airspeed  and  configuration.  If  not  at  an  established rejoin/get  well  position  or  visual,  ML  will  also  pass  reference  heading,  altitude deconfliction and reference position. (T-3) 3.4.6.2.  Mid-Mission  Rejoins.    A  mid-mission  rejoin  should  provide  sufficient  time beyond  the  planned  rendezvous  point  to  affect  the  rejoin.    Prior  to  the  rendezvous  lead will be directive by specifying altitudes for all aircraft, airspeed, heading, and formation position for the wingman (or wingmen) to assume. 3.4.6.3.  During  Night/IMC  rejoins,  wingmen  will  maintain  1,000  feet  of  vertical separation until rejoined.  During Day/VMC rejoins, wingmen will maintain 1,000 feet of vertical separation until they establish visual contact. 3.4.7.  Lead/Position  Changes.    During  a  lead  change  the  Flight  Lead  will  transfer  all navigation, lead position, command and control (C2) communications and tactical flight call sign  to  the  wingman.    During  a  position  change  the  Flight  Lead  will  transfer  only  tactical navigation and the lead position unless briefed otherwise.  The Flight Lead reserves the right to maneuver the formation and/or direct a position change back at any time and will provide specific guidance during the mission brief or at the time of position change execution for all other delegation of duties or responsibilities (radios, profile management, etc.). 3.4.7.1.  Lead/Position Change in IMC.  In IMC, lead will initiate a lead/position change from a stabilized wings level attitude. Maneuvering aircraft shall maintain at least ½ NM lateral separation from all other aircraft. (T-3) AFI11-2B-1V3  20 MARCH 2015   17  3.4.7.2.  Lead/Position  Change  in  VMC.  Flight  leads  shall  not  initiate  a  lead/position change, unless the aircraft assuming the lead is in a position from which they can safely initiate the lead/position change and maintain visual contact. (T-3) 3.4.7.3.  All  lead  changes  will  ensure  a  positive  transfer  of  lead  authority  is accomplished. (T-3) 3.4.8.  Flight-path Deconfliction: 3.4.8.1.  Apply the following rules for flight path deconfliction during maneuvering. 3.4.8.1.1.  Normally, the wingman is responsible for flight path deconfliction. 3.4.8.1.2.  Lead  becomes  responsible  for  deconfliction  when  the  wingman  calls "Blind" or maneuvering places lead within the wingman’s "blind cone." 3.4.8.1.3.  Except when maneuvers place the wingman in front of lead, wingmen must maneuver relative to the flight lead and maintain visual contact.  Normally, wingmen should cross above lead when deconfliction is required. (T-3) 3.4.8.2.  Blind  Calls.  Use  the  following  procedures  when  visual,  Link  16  datalink  and radar contact within the formation is lost. (T-1) 3.4.8.2.1.  When  any  flight  member  calls  "Blind,"  the  other  flight  member(s)  will immediately respond with “Visual,” “Tied,” or "Blind”.  If blind, flight members will also report location and altitude.  If the other flight member(s) responds with “Visual” or  “Tied”  they  are  responsible  for  deconfliction  until  the  first  crew  regains  contact and calls “Visual” or “Tied.” 3.4.8.2.2.  When  all  flight  members  are  blind  the  Flight  Lead  will  take  action  to establish and maintain altitude separation, and will call initiating and rolling out of all turns, starting any climbs or descents, passing each 5,000 foot altitude increment and leveling  off.    Flight  members  will  maintain  altitude  separation  until  visual  or  radar contact is regained. 3.4.8.2.3.  When  there  is  not  a  timely  acknowledgment  of  the  original  "Blind"  call and altitude separation is  in  doubt, the flight  member initiating the “Blind” call will call “Knock-It-Off,” maneuver away from the last known position of the other flight member(s)  and  increase  vertical  spacing.    Use  Lost  Wingman  procedures  in paragraph 7.8 if the situation warrants.  Refer to AFI 11-214, Air Operations Rules and Procedures, for Knock-It-Off procedures. 3.4.9.  Operations  Check  (Ops  Checks).    Accomplish  sufficient  ops  checks  to  ensure  safe mission accomplishment. (T-3) 3.4.9.1.  Aircrew will perform Ops Checks: 3.4.9.1.1.  At level-off after takeoff. 3.4.9.1.2.  Prior  to  each  Dissimilar  Air  Combat  Tactics  (DACT)  engagement  or intercept. 3.4.9.1.3.  Prior to entering an air-to-surface range and after departing the range. 3.4.9.1.4.  Following air refueling.   18  AFI11-2B-1V3  20 MARCH 2015 3.4.9.2.  Aircrew will, at a minimum, check the following items during Ops Checks: 3.4.9.2.1.  Central Air Data Computers (CADC) (AOA indicators within .8 degrees) 3.4.9.2.2.  Hydraulic panel 3.4.9.2.3.  Engine instruments 3.4.9.2.4.  Fuel controls/total fuel 3.4.9.2.5.  Oxygen system 3.4.9.2.6.  Electrical system 3.4.9.2.7.  Cabin altitude 3.4.9.2.8.  Automatic Flight Control System Mode Select Panel 3.4.9.2.9.  Surface Position Indicator (SPI) (stab position) 3.4.9.2.10.  Ejection seat status 3.4.9.2.11.  Nearest emergency airfield 3.4.9.2.12.  LINK/MDS status 3.4.9.3.  For formation flights, Mission Leads will initiate ops checks. 3.4.10.  Radio Procedures. (T-3) 3.4.10.1.  The  Flight  Lead  or  Mission  Lead  shall  develop  and  brief  a  communication plan. 3.4.10.2.  Ultra  High  Frequency  (UHF)  radio  normally  will  be  the  primary  means  of communication  between  aircraft.    Do  not  fly  formation  on  training  sorties  without interplane communications capability, except in an emergency.  Except for loss of radios, all  flight  members  will  maintain  a  common  frequency.    All  capable  aircraft  should monitor the same ATC frequency unless mission requirements dictate otherwise. (T-3) 3.4.10.3.  Unless  directed  otherwise  in  operational  plans,  formation  aircraft  should  use individual call signs during rejoins, air refueling operations, after formation breakup and during emergency situations. (T-3) 3.4.10.4.  Use  brevity  codes  and  other  terminology  IAW  AFTTP  3-2.5,  Multi-Service Brevity  Codes;  AFI  11-214,  Air  Operations  Rules  and  Procedures;  AFTTP  3-1.B-1. Tactical Employment—B-1; and B-1 Mission Standards. 3.4.10.5.  No Radio (NORDO) Procedures. 3.4.10.5.1.  During  VMC,  use  the  following  guidance  for  mutual  support  of  a NORDO aircraft in the formation. 3.4.10.5.1.1.  When  the  lead  aircraft  is  NORDO,  lead  will  inform  the  wingman with a wing rock.  The wingman will acknowledge with a wing rock and move to the  outer  limits  of  Route/inner  limits  of  Fluid.    The  wingman  will  take  the  lead and the NORDO aircraft will move aft to establish Route/Fluid on the new lead. (T-3) 3.4.10.5.1.2.  When a wingman is  NORDO, the wingman will move to  the outer AFI11-2B-1V3  20 MARCH 2015   19  limits  of  Route/inner  limits  of  Fluid  and  give  lead  a  wing  rock.    Lead  will acknowledge with a wing rock and terminates maneuvering IAW AFI 11-214, Air Operations Rules and Procedures. (T-3) 3.4.10.5.1.3.  The  recognition  of  a  NORDO  situation  in  IMC  may  be  difficult.  Aircraft should remain in current formation position using all available means of deconfliction  including  radar,  A/A  TACAN,  and  altitude  separation  to  the maximum  extent  possible.    On  arrival  at  the  destination  or  divert  base  the formation should proceed to an instrument approach fix (IAF) with the NORDO aircraft in trail stacked down at the IAF altitude and the other aircraft 1,000 feet above.  At the IAF the NORDO aircraft will execute the approach while the other aircraft will remain in holding, terminate MARSA with ATC, and coordinate for their own approach. (T-3) 3.4.11.  Dissimilar  Formations.    Aircrew  will  apply  normal  formation  procedures  during dissimilar formation as applicable while giving special consideration to aircraft performance differences.  The  Flight/Mission  Lead  will  brief  flight  members  on  flight  responsibilities, proper  formation  position  (to  ensure  adequate  wingtip  clearance),  and  aircraft-unique requirements for each phase of flight. (T-3)   20  AFI11-2B-1V3  20 MARCH 2015 Chapter 4 INSTRUMENT PROCEDURES 4.1.  Approach  Category.  The  B-1  is  approach  Category  E.    Use  approach  Category  D minimums  in  an  emergency/divert  situation  where  no  Category  E  minimums  are  published provided: 4.1.1.  A straight-in approach is flown. 4.1.2.  The  aircraft  gross  weight  allows  final  approach  airspeed  of  165  Knots  Indicated Airspeed (KIAS) or less. 4.1.3.  The missed approach segment of the approach, if required, is flown at 255 knots True Airspeed  (KTAS)  or  less.    Aircrews  must  realize  that  at  high  pressure  altitudes  and  high temperatures  normal  missed  approach  procedures  may  allow  the  aircraft  to  exceed    255 KTAS and in turn place the aircraft outside the obstacle clearance guaranteed in the missed approach  segment.    Note:  Units  may  request  MAJCOM  assistance  to  have  Category  E minimums  published  for  airfields  used  on  a  recurring  basis  for  emergency/divert  practice approach work. 4.2.  Navigation.  The B-1 is approved to use internal navigation system (INS)/Doppler Velocity System  mode,  with  a  radar  position  update  at  least  every  3  hours,  for  operations  in  basic  area navigation (RNAV) (BRNAV) airspace or routes.

Aircrew  will  only  fly  in  the  Stream,  Wedge,  or  Line  Abreast  position during tactical maneuvering below 5,000 feet AGL.  Aircrew will not fly the Wedge or Line Abreast position below 500 feet AGL. 7.7.1.3.2.  Aircrew will not initiate or accomplish rejoins below 1,000 feet AGL.   26  AFI11-2B-1V3  20 MARCH 2015 7.7.1.3.3.  Aircrew  may  fly  in  the  Fluid  or  Route  position  below  5,000  feet  AGL during  departures,  recoveries,  or  authorized  flyovers.    Flyovers  in  route/fluid  are limited  to  350  KIAS  or  less,  unless  both  Aircraft  Commanders  are  qualified  and current in Low Altitude Visual Formation. 7.7.2.  Route/Observation.    Route/Observation  is  not  a  tactical  employment  formation. Aircraft will stabilize at 1,000 feet separation prior to proceeding closer to lead. (T-3) 7.7.3.  Battle Damage Checks.  When circumstances permit, flight leads should direct a battle damage  check  after  actual  weapon  deliveries  and/or  prior  to  return  to  base  (RTB).    Do  not perform  the  check  at  night  or  during  IMC  and  fly  no  closer  than  Route  formation  spacing.  (T-3) 7.8.  Lost  Wingman  Procedures.  Aircrew  will  use  the  following  procedures  if  they  cannot maintain visual contact and ensure positive separation when flying visual formation.  In any lost wingman situation, immediate separation of aircraft is essential to maintain safety.  Upon losing visual and radar contact with the leader, or if unable to maintain formation due to disorientation, the  wingman  will  simultaneously  execute  the  applicable  Lost  Wingman  procedure.    Once  a wingman  executes  lost  wingman  procedures,  the  Flight  Lead/Mission  Lead  must  clear  the wingman to rejoin. (T-3) 7.8.1.  In  wings  level  flight  (climbing,  descending,  or  level)  simultaneously  transition  to instruments,  inform  lead,  turn  15  degrees  away  and  maintain  new  heading  for  15  seconds, then  return  to  the  original  heading  and  attempt  to  acquire  lead  on  radar.    Ensure  500  feet altitude  separation.    Return  to  formation  with  lead’s  permission  or,  if  required,  obtain  a separate clearance from the controlling agency. 7.8.2.  On  the  outside  of  the  turn  (climbing,  descending  or  level),  transition  to  instruments, roll  wings  level,  and  inform  lead.    Continue  straight  ahead  to  ensure  separation  prior  to resuming  turn  and  attempt  to  acquire  lead  on  radar.    Ensure  500  feet  altitude  separation. Return to formation with lead’s permission or, if required, obtain a separate clearance from the controlling agency. 7.8.3.  On the inside of the turn (climbing, descending or level), transition to instruments to maintain established bank angle, reduce airspeed by 10 KIAS to ensure clearance, and inform lead.    Lead  will  simultaneously  roll  wings  level,  maintain  airspeed,  and  acknowledge wingman’s call with  heading and altitude.   If lead acknowledges the lost wingman call and confirms  lead  aircraft  is  wings  level,  the  wingman  will,  after  15  seconds,  roll  wings  level, establish 500 feet altitude separation, turn to lead’s reference heading and attempt to acquire lead on radar.  If lead does not acknowledge loss of visual contact, maintain established bank angle, establish 500 feet altitude separation, roll out on new heading, attempt to acquire lead on  radar,  and  with  lead’s  permission  reform  into  trail  formation  position.    If  radar/visual contact cannot be reestablished, obtain separate clearance from the controlling agency. 7.9.  Air Refueling Limitations and Restrictions. 7.9.1.  Do not accomplish air refueling during training missions when: 7.9.1.1.

During  any  in-flight  ACU  reload  or  INS  air  alignment,  practice  or  actual, maintain  straight  and  level  flight  to  the  maximum  extent  possible  and  crosscheck  VSD attitudes with the standby attitude indicator and the aft station attitude indicators. 7.14.7.3.  When the ACU complex and/or all INSs are not fully operational aircrew must maintain VMC to the maximum extent possible, regardless of GSS status. 7.15.  Emergency Limitations. 7.15.1.  Do not practice in-flight emergency procedures with weapons loaded on the aircraft. (T-3) 7.15.2.  Do not practice compound emergencies during flight (unless specifically required for upgrade training). (T-3) 7.15.3.  Aircraft Operations with One Engine Inoperative.  Aircrew will not takeoff with one engine inoperative from start of takeoff roll except during emergency evacuation, with wing commander approval or when directed by MAJCOM. (T-2) 7.15.4.  During  an in-flight emergency the most experienced or qualified  pilot  should make the landing.  As in all situations the aircraft commander should balance the experience, skill, and proficiency of the  crewmember  flying  against  the complexity of the  event  to  be flown. (T-3) AFI11-2B-1V3  20 MARCH 2015   31  7.15.5.  Aircrews will declare an IFE for any of the following situations: (T-3) 7.15.5.1.  Any  time  an  Emergency  Procedure  (EP)  checklist  states  “land  as  soon  as possible.” 7.15.5.2.  Any  situation  where  aircrews  refer  to  a  T.O.  1B-1B-1,  Flight  Manual  USAF Series B-1 Aircraft, Section 3 Landing Checklist. 7.15.5.3.  Any planned landing with other than normal wing, flap/slat or gear position, or normal braking capability. 7.15.5.4.  In any case where current or foreseeable system failures could make immediate ground assistance (e.g., fire, medical, maintenance, supervision) advisable. 7.15.5.5.  If any doubt exists in the opinion of the aircrew or Supervisor of Flying (SOF) about the safety of the aircrew or aircraft’s performance. 7.16.  Aircrew and Aircraft Limitations. 7.16.1.  Aircrews  will  not  taxi,  takeoff,  or  land  when  the  measured  Runway  Condition Reading (RCR) is less than 9 without OG/CC approval. (T-3) 7.16.2.  Structural  Limitations.    The  following  restrictions  are  a  result  of  the  Aircraft Structural  Integrity  Program  (ASIP)  and  are  imposed  to  increase  the  life  of  the  airframe.  Unnecessary additional weight and overall “G” loading are key factors in reducing the life of the  aircraft.    Aircrew  should  be  aware  of  the  ASIP  and  realize  smoothness  in  all  phases  of flight  reduces  unnecessary  wear  and  tear  on  the  aircraft.    Unnecessary  additional  gross weight is the single most damaging factor to the aircraft.  Units should reduce fuel loads to the minimum required to accomplish the mission. (T-3) 7.16.2.1.  For gross weights between 275,000 and 300,000 pounds, aircrews are limited to a  maximum  of  two  approaches.    This  restriction  does  not  apply  when  aircrews  require multiple approaches for formal training or when necessary for safety of flight. (T-3) 7.16.2.2.  Units will plan sortie fuel loads with ASIP and fuel conservation considerations in mind.  Units and aircrew should request the minimum fuel load required to complete the  mission  and  land  at  or  below  230,000  pounds  gross  weight  unless  required  fuel reserves dictate otherwise. (T-3) 7.16.2.3.  Aircrew  should  restrict  maximum  afterburner  climb-outs  to  syllabus  training, ATC  requests,  safety  of  flight,  or  those  climbs  required  for  tactical  threat/weapons employment. (T-3) 7.16.3.  Operational G-Limits. (T-3) 7.16.3.1.  Aircrew will adhere to the following peacetime operational G-limits: 7.16.3.1.1.  15  and  20  Wing.    Limit  to  1.5g.  T.O.  1B-1B-1,  Flight  Manual  USAF Series B-1 Aircraft, limits the B-1 to 1.5g maximum at 15 and 20 wing. 7.16.3.1.2.  25, 45, and 55 Wing.  Limit to 1.5g. T.O. 1B-1B-1, Flight Manual USAF Series B-1 Aircraft, may allow more g’s (dependent on GW), however, the potential for  exceeding  the  structural  limits  outweighs  the  additional  .5g  capability  in  the peacetime environment.   32  AFI11-2B-1V3  20 MARCH 2015 7.16.3.1.3.  65  and  67.5  Wing.    Limit  to  2.5g.  T.O.  1B-1B-1,  Flight  Manual  USAF Series B-1 Aircraft,  may allow more g’s (dependent on GW), however, the potential for  exceeding  the  structural  limits  outweighs  the  additional  .5g  capability  in  the peacetime environment. 7.16.3.2.  Document aircraft over-g’s when the aircraft is flown outside of the parameters outlined in T.O. 1B-1B-1 Flight Manual USAF Series B-1 Aircraft. 7.16.3.2.1.  Momentary deviations outside of the operational limits may not constitute a  “over  g”  unless  also  outside  of  the  parameters  in  T.O.  1B-1B-1,  Flight  Manual USAF Series B-1 Aircraft. 7.16.3.2.2.  Aircrew experiencing an over-g (whether flagged by CITS or observed by the  aircrew)  will  terminate  the  mission  and  accomplish  a  controllability  check. Aircrew  will  annotate  aircraft  configuration,  gross  weight,  and  observed  over  g  in AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document.” 7.16.4.  In  addition  to  the  requirements  set  forth  in  AFI  11-202V3,  Flying  Operations  – General Flight Rules, aircrew will not use cameras during takeoffs, landings, and any activity below 1,000 feet AGL without OG/CC approval. (T-3) 7.16.4.1.  Aircrew and assigned intelligence personnel will not share or distribute cockpit recordable media with anyone outside of their respective MDS without approval from the Wing Commanders. (T-3) 7.16.5.  Aircraft  Tire  Wear.    The  Maximum  Wear  Limit  (MWL)  for  authorized  B-1  tires (Goodyear and Michelin Aviator/Air-X) is three cords.  Once the third cord is showing, the tire is unserviceable and requires replacement.  The MWL applies to both main and nose gear tires on the B-1.  A visible red cord is only an indicator and should not be used to determine the serviceability of a tire due to the fact that not all tires will possess a red cord.  The MWL is the only true indicator of tire wear. (T-3) 7.16.6.  Overheated/Hot  Brakes.    Aircrew  will  not  quick  turn  (i.e.  engine  running  crew change,  hot/warm  pit  refuel,  etc.)  an  aircraft  that  lands  with  a  known  or  suspected  brake overheat  condition  (any  brake  temperatures  above  600ºF).    Maintenance  personnel  are required  to  perform  landing  gear  and  anti-skid  operational  inspections  IAW  T.O.  1B-1B-6, B-1 Work Unit Code Manual, which requires shutting down engines and thereby terminating any quick turn option by the aircrew. (T-3) 7.16.6.1.  Aircrew  identifying  actual  or  suspected  brake  overheat  condition  via  CITS parameter  monitor  code,  main  caution  panel  BRAKE  TEMP  light  or  who  otherwise suspect  a  brake  overheat  condition  will  immediately  notify  maintenance  personnel  and anticipate shutting down engines. 7.16.6.2.  Aircrews  on  the  front  half  of  a  quick  turn  will  anticipate  and  plan  for  heavy weight  landing  conditions  when  returning  to  the  airfield  in  order  to  mitigate  the occurrence of hot brakes. 7.16.6.3.  Taxi operations are permitted if the overheat condition no longer exists. 7.17.  Weapon Employment Restrictions. AFI11-2B-1V3  20 MARCH 2015   33  7.17.1.  Aircrew should withhold weapons when the release will exceed aircraft T.O. limits, CG limits, briefed track/timing tolerances, or deconfliction for fragmentation. (T-3) 7.17.2.  While carrying weapons, do not conduct: (T-3) 7.17.2.1.  Simulated bomb or missile runs. 7.17.2.2.  Unusual maneuvers. 7.17.2.3.  Approach to stall. 7.17.2.4.  Touch-and-go landings. 7.17.3.  Aircrew  may  accomplish  low  altitude  training  and  electronic  attack  (EA)  with retained weapons provided they do not select or designate targets. 7.17.4.  During training missions, aircrew will not open weapon bay doors during flight with weapons  on  board  other  than  for  intentional  release  or  jettison.    During  contingency operations, OG/CC may approve aircrew to open weapon bay doors with weapons on board with the intent of ensuring proper door operation provided the aircrew can confirm they are over sparsely populated areas, preferably over water. (T-3) 7.18.  Supersonic  Flight.  During  training  sorties,  aircrew  will  fly  supersonic  only  within  the confines of designated supersonic areas (e.g. MOA, ATCAA, SUAS, or over oceans).  Aircrew will report any unauthorized flight at or above Mach 1.0 to the squadron commander and notify the Operations Group airspace manager of the occurrence using an AF  Form  121,  Sonic Boom Log.  Consult AFI 13-201 ACC Supplement 1, Airspace Management, for further information on supersonic operations. 7.19.  Publications.  Aircrew will carry on board for each flight, at a minimum, one full copy of T.O. 1B-1B-4, Flight Manual Supplement CITS Operator USAF Series B-1 Aircraft, and Section III of T.O. 1B-1B-1, Flight Manual USAF Series B-1 Aircraft. (T-2)   34  AFI11-2B-1V3  20 MARCH 2015 Chapter 8 LOCAL OPERATING PROCEDURES 8.1.  General.  This  chapter  provides  a  consolidated  framework  for  units  to  supplement  local operating  procedures.

Release—The OAS issues a release pulse in either automatic or manual mode with all switches correctly positioned. High Altitude Activity—Same as AFI 11-2B-1 V1, B-1 Aircrew Training.  Above 25,000 feet MSL (For weapons delivery events above 17,000 feet MSL). Hung  Weapon—A  live  or  inert  weapon  that  does  not  separate  from  the  aircraft  following  an attempted release.  Note:  Weapons not released due to being blocked, a swing arm malfunction or  a  "slow  switch  status  following  squib  fire"  are  considered  retained  if  the  "hung  state"  is removed and the fault clears following corrective action by the OSO. Lead  Change—Used during formation when the ML/FL transfers all navigation, lead position, command  and  control  (C2)  communications,  and  tactical  flight  call  sign  to  the  wingman.    The ML/FL will usually not maneuver the formation or direct a lead change back once a lead change has  occurred.    Lead  changes  are  typically  used  when  an  emergency  or  other  extenuating circumstances exist such that the ML/FL can no longer fully control the formation. Live  Weapon—Actual  munitions  containing  a  primary  explosive  charge  (MK-82,  CBU-87, etc.). Low  Altitude  Activity—Same  as  AFI  11-2B-1  V1,  B-1  Aircrew  Training.    Below  5,000  feet AGL. Medium Altitude Activity—Same as AFI 11-2B-1 V1, B-1 Aircrew Training.  From 5,000 feet AGL  to  25,000  feet  MSL  (For  weapons  delivery  events  from  5,000  feet  MSL  to  17,000  feet MSL). Mission  Lead—The  Mission  Lead the  aircrew  member  responsible  for  mission accomplishment.    This  includes  planning,  leading,  and  debriefing  the  mission.    When is AFI11-2B-1V3  20 MARCH 2015   43  circumstances dictate, the Mission Lead does not have to be in the lead aircraft or position during the flight. Operating  Altitudes—Altitudes  for  all  U.S.  military  training  routes  will  be  published in  FLIP AP/1B,  Military  Training  Routes.    TF/VC  altitudes  will  be  based  on  a  minimum  altitude published for the route or the clearance plane settings developed by local  airspace managers at the originating activity, whichever is higher. (T-1) Position  Change—Used  during  formation  to  make  the  wingman  the  tactical  flight  lead.    The ML/FL will transfer only tactical navigation and the lead position unless briefed otherwise.  The ML/FL reserves the right to maneuver the formation and/or direct a position change back at any time and will provide specific guidance during the mission brief or at the time of position change execution for all other delegation of duties or responsibilities (radios, profile management, etc.).  Position  changes  usually  occurs  during  training  sorties  where  currencies/training  requires  it  or when  a  non-mission  aborting  system  malfunction  requires  the  wingman  to  lead  the  formation while preserving two-ship employment. (T-3) Retained  Weapon—A  weapon  still  on  board  the  aircraft  with  no  release  attempted  or  after successfully releasing the intended number of weapons in a partial load.  Weapons not released due  to  procedural  errors  are  retained.    NOTE:  Weapons  not  released  due  to  being  blocked,  a swing arm malfunction or a "slow switch status following squib fire" are considered retained if the "hung state" is removed and the fault clears following corrective action by the OSO. RNAV  (Area  Navigation)—A  method  of  navigation  that  permits  aircraft  operation  on  any desired course within the coverage of station-referenced navigation signals or within the limits of a self-contained system capability, or a combination of these. Show  of  Force—A  maneuver  intended  to  warn  or  intimidate  an  opponent  and  to  demonstrate capability or will to act if provoked. Visual  Contour  Flight—Operation  at  a  predetermined  altitude  above  the  ground,  following contours visually with radar altimeter crosscheck. Weapon—Any live, inert, or training munitions.    44  AFI11-2B-1V3  20 MARCH 2015 Attachment 2 PASSENGER BRIEFING GUIDE A2.1.  Ground Operations.  (NOTE: *Item will be briefed at the aircraft).

General  Information.  Potential  adversary  use  of  CBRNE  weapons  against  a  friendly airfield  presents  a  serious  threat  to  flying  operations.    Although  the  most  effective  way  for aircrews  to  avoid  this  threat  is  to  be  airborne  before  these  weapons  are  detonated  or  dispersed and then land at a field that has not been contaminated, all personnel must be prepared to operate from a field that has come under CBRNE attack.  Each air base should publish detailed CBRN procedures.  The following information is for use when base-specific procedures are unknown or incomplete. (T-3) A3.1.1.  Counter-CBRN actions can be grouped into environments.  First is where chemical or  biological  agents  are  dispersed  from  munitions  or  sprayed  as  an  aerosol  resulting  in  a cloud  or  rain  of  minute  droplets.    The  nuclear  environment  is  within  range  of  any  direct effect from a nuclear detonation.  The radiological environment’s hazard is radioactive dust that  can  originate  as  fallout  from  a  detonation  or  from  dispersal  of  radioactive  material without a nuclear detonation -- a dirty bomb.  Procedures in all environments except nuclear are  similar  --  use  procedures  and  protective  gear  to  avoid  skin  contact  with  or inhalation/ingestion of agents or particles. A3.2.  Mission Preparation.  Determine the CBRN status at planned launch, recovery and divert bases.  Know the current Mission Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) level for relevant sectors of the launch airfield.  Plan ground ops to minimize the time between leaving shelter and takeoff.  If available, use additional aircrew to perform preflight duties to minimize flight crew exposure. A3.3.  Travel To/From the Aircraft and Aircraft Preflight.  Step in the appropriate protective ensemble and carry other protective gear as required.  If possible, travel to and from the aircraft in  an  enclosed  vehicle  to  prevent  contamination  from  agents  or  dust  settling  from  the  air.    If travel  on  foot  is  unavoidable,  choose  a  route  that  takes  maximum  advantage  of  available overhead cover (sun shades, buildings, etc.).  If the aircraft is contaminated, ensure maintenance has  accomplished  spot  decontamination  and  avoid  contaminating  your  person  during  preflight.  Take steps to avoid bringing contamination into the aircraft on helmet bags, map bags, etc. In a potential  CBRN  environment,  keep  aircraft  hatch  closed  as  much  as  possible  when  outside protective  shelter.    Post-mission,  if  there  is  any  suspicion  of  aircrew  contamination  process through an aircrew contamination control area (ACCA). A3.4.  Ground Operations during Alarm Red (or Theater Equivalent). A3.4.1.  Before Taxi Out and After Taxi Back.  If Alarm Red, or equivalent, occurs while the crew is outside the aircraft or in the chocks, shut down and exit the aircraft (if appropriate), take cover and don appropriate MOPP.  This may require use of the ground crew mask.  A hardened  facility  such  as  a  hardened  aircraft  shelter  (HAS)  provides  optimum  protection.  Ensure the safety of supporting ground crew; use hand signals if necessary. A3.4.2.  Ground  Operations  Outside  the  Parking  Spot.    Maintain  contact  with  SOF,  ATC, Command  Post,  etc.  to  remain  aware  of  ground  hazards  and  command  direction.    If  Alarm Red,  or  equivalent,  occurs  while  on  the  ground  outside  the  chocks,  there  are  two  primary options.    First  is  to  taxi  to  an  area  available  along  the  taxi  route  that  provides  increased AFI11-2B-1V3  20 MARCH 2015   47  protection  or  dispersion.    If  protection  is  not  available,  the  best  option  may  be  launch  to survive contingent on fuel state, proximity to runway, nature of attack, etc.  If protection or takeoff  is  not  possible,  attempt  to  exit  the  taxi  flow.    In  extremis,  especially  with  no protective  mask  available,  select  100  percent  oxygen  and  consider  turning  off  the environmental  control  system  and/or  shutting  down  to  avoid  bringing  agent/dust  into  the aircraft.  Leave the aircraft hatch closed and await assistance. A3.5.  Airborne. A3.5.1.  Contamination.    Becoming  contaminated  by  chemical  or  biological  agents  while airborne  is  very  unlikely.    If  chemical  agent  contamination  occurred  prior  to  takeoff,  flight will  dissipate  the  agent  to  some  degree,  but  will  not  achieve  complete  decontamination.  Flights of at least 2 to 4 hours are recommended, and lower altitudes are more effective than higher  altitudes.    Fly  with  the  aircraft  configured  (gear  and  flaps  extended)  as  long  as possible  to  maximize  the  airflow  in  and  around  as  many  places  as  possible.    There  is  no simple  guidance  for  biological  contaminants.    If  suspected,  maintain  maximum  protective posture.  If radioactive dust contamination is suspected, take measures to avoid skin contact, inhalation, or oral consumption.  Seek decontamination assistance after landing A3.5.2.  During  the  Mission  and  RTB.    Use  command  and  control  agencies  to  maintain awareness of command intent and the status of primary and alternate landing locations.  Do not  attempt  to  land  during  Alarm  Red,  or  equivalent,  situations  unless  there  is  no  other option.  Follow C2 directions and hold or divert.  If holding, try to wait until Alarm Red, or equivalent, is terminated.  When able, obtain updates on airfield status, ground hazards, and taxi  routing.    If  landing  in  Alarm  Black,  expect  a  contaminated  environment  and  MOPP  4.  Droplet settling following a chemical or biological airburst attack can take up to one hour.  If you believe the aircraft was contaminated before takeoff or while airborne, notify C2.    48  AFI11-2B-1V3  20 MARCH 2015 Attachment 4 STRANGE FIELD FAMILIARIZATION A4.1.  Use  of  Guide.  The following procedures aid aircrew in their preparation for flights into strange airfields.  This outline is a guide and aircrew should review only the information that is appropriate to their mission (for example, load bearing capacity need not be reviewed for flights into  airfields  with  similar  aircraft).    Reference  AFI  11-202V3,  Flying  Operations  –  General Flight Rules, for further guidance. (T-3) A4.2.  General  Information.  During  mission  planning,  aircrews  should  review  the  following for each base of intended landing. (T-3) A4.2.1.  Airfield  Suitability  and  Restrictions  Report  (ASRR)  from  the  Global  Decision Support System (GDSS) database.  Per AFI 11-202 Volume 3, Flying Operations – General Flight Rules, each MAJCOM will establish specific policy on applicability, availability, and access procedures regarding the use of ASRR. A4.2.1.1.  A  copy  of  the  ASRR  and  individual  airfield  assessments  from  the  GDSS database can be obtained by contacting the Air Mobility Command (AMC) Airfield Help Desk: Airfield.Helpdesk@us.af.mil or DSN 312-779-3112.
