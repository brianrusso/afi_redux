IAW  DoT  standards  and  the  AAMVA  model CDL program, the Air Force requires additional training and evaluation to operate a CMV with air brakes (See Section 5). 5.2.3.3.2.5.  Transportation  of  Hazardous  Materials  endorsement requires additional  knowledge  and  skill  sets  in  accordance  with  AAMVA  requirements.  Note:  For information on the knowledge and skill sets required for the AF vehicle operator  transporting  hazardous  material,  see  AFMAN  24-306,  the  Hazardous Materials Lesson Plan and the AAMVA CDL Manual.   5.3. Tractor-Trailer Design Overview.  5.3.1.  Tractor-trailer design.  A tractor-trailer, also referred to as an 18-wheeler, semi, semi-trailer, or big rig, is a vehicle designed to carry cargo.  Refer to the manufacturer’s operator’s manual for additional information on the tractor-trailer being operated, and to the data plate for safe load capacity guidance.  The tractor-trailer normally can be identified by the following characteristics:  5.3.1.1.  Total of 5 axles/18 wheels.   5.3.1.1.1.   Tractor (typically) 3 axles:  One front (“steer” axle); 2 rear (“drive” axles) with a pair of dual wheels on each side.  Most tractor configurations have 10 wheels. 5.3.1.1.2.   Trailer (typically) has 2 axles:   2 rear with  a pair of dual  wheels  on each side, or 8 wheels on the trailer.   5.3.1.2.  Total length 50 to 70 feet.  5.3.1.3.  Typical weight limit 80,000 lbs.  5.3.1.4.  Common components.  5.3.1.4.1.   Air brakes.  5.3.1.4.2.   Coupling  device  “5th  wheel”  (allows  easy  hook  up  and  release  of  semi-trailer).  5.3.2.  Common types of trailers.  5.3.2.1.  25- and 40-foot low-bed trailer (25 ton).  This trailer is used primarily as a regular flatbed trailer.  The operator will need to know:   5.3.2.1.1.   Tiedown points/ loops location on the side of the trailer (5) and how to attach a chain to each side to increase tiedown locations and the location of the storage bins.  If the tiedown locations do not match up with the tiedown locations of the cargo, the operator may also to run chains down the side of the trailer and secure the chain using a binder.  5.3.2.1.2.   Storage compartments location on the top of the gooseneck.  They may be used to store chains, binders and straps.  Cargo should not be loaded on the gooseneck for any reason.  5.3.2.1.3.   The height of the cargo and how it relates to the maximum height allowed in the area.  5.3.2.2.  32-foot van trailer.  This trailer is primarily used for small non-palletized cargo, sensitive equipment, mail, and cargo that is weather sensitive.  5.3.2.2.1.   Rear doors.  5.3.2.2.1.1.  Two securing rods that run the height of the doors.  5.3.2.2.1.2.  Two door latches top and bottom of each door (securing rod locks into latches).  The securing rod must be inserted into both door latches before pushing and lowering the door handle.  5.3.2.2.1.3.  The driver side door must be closed before the passenger side door in order to shut and lock the doors.  They are closed when moving.  5.3.2.2.1.4.  Open carefully, cargo may shift en route.  5.3.2.2.2.   Height of trailer.  While moving and loading cargo, watch for overhead and side clearance. Never load cargo on the top of a trailer.  While transporting cargo, be alert  for  any  object  that  protrudes  from  the  side  of  the  road  or  overhead  (branches, electrical lines, signal lights, etc.). 5.3.2.2.3.   Stabilizing arms.  Two stabilizing arms are mounted to stabilize the trailer when being loaded without a tractor being attached to the trailer. 5.3.2.2.3.1.  Lowering stabilizing arms.  Remove the cotter pins and lower the arms.  When the arms reach the ground, place the cotter pins back into their original place.  Note:  If stabilizing arms are not lowered and secured, the trailer could nose dive and cause serious injury and damage.  5.3.2.2.4.   Vent panels.  Located on both the front side and each rear door of the trailer.  Open when transporting cargo over long distances or in hot weather.    5.3.2.2.5.   Tie-down points inside the van trailer.  Located every five feet on the floor, or running up the side of each wall.  5.3.2.2.6.   Clearance lights.  Mounted at all four corners and midway down each side.  5.3.2.3.  40-foot  tri-axle  flatbed  trailer.    The  major  difference  between  this  trailer  and regular flatbeds is that it is designed to haul heavier loads and ox carts.  5.3.2.3.1.   Height of the trailer and cargo cannot exceed legal limits  5.3.2.3.2.   May be equipped with side rails (raise side rails to carry small, loose loaded items)  5.3.2.3.3.   Three  axles  to  accommodate  heavy  cargo  that  exceed  that  of  a  regular tandem axle trailer.  5.3.2.3.4.   The third axle affects the turning radius.  When the trailer makes sharp turns it wears on the tires.  If the trailer is loaded, sharp turns could snap the axle or blow a tire due to the skidding effect.  5.3.2.4.  32-foot Kentucky trailer.  This trailer is used primarily as a regular flatbed trailer but is mounted with side rails.  The operator will need to know:  5.3.2.4.1.   Side rails.  May be removed by securing to the front wall with straps in order to haul larger cargo item.  To install the rails, place all of the stabilizing posts in the slots, slide the rails between the posts from top to bottom, and ensure both sides of the rails are inserted in the rail guides on each post.  5.3.2.4.2.   Storage compartments.  Mounted on the bottom of the bed and used to store chains, binders and straps.  The compartment must be secured to the trailer and the door must be secured shut by shutting the latch and installing the safety pin.  5.3.2.4.3.   Front wall.  (Approximately 3-feet  high mounted, non-removable.)  Rails will be secured to this wall, when not installed; small cargo can be loaded on the bed and strapped against the wall.  5.3.2.4.4.   Height of the trailer and cargo will not exceed legal limits  5.3.2.4.5.   Blind spots are concerns due to the mounted rails on the front of the bed.  The largest blind spot is on the passenger side almost parallel with the fifth wheel, and on the driver’s side just behind the cab.  5.3.2.5.  40-foot Rollerized Trailer.  This trailer is used to transport 463L pallets ONLY.  5.3.2.5.1.   Five 463L pallets may be loaded at a time.  Ensure the rear-loading ramp is in the raised position.  This trailer can be loaded via forklift or K-loader ONLY.   5.3.2.5.2.   Rollerized bed.  There are three rows of rollers that run the entire length.  Ensure that rollers are secure, lubricated and all sections are flush.  Between the rows of rollers there are two paths for footing to push the pallets.  Note:  NEVER walk on the  rollers,  ensure  the  trailer  bed  is  clear  prior  to  pushing  a  pallet  down  the  roller surface, and never load rolling stock onto the trailer. 5.3.2.5.3.   Guide rails.  Mounted on both sides of the trailer by “L” brackets.  Used to direct pallets in a straight line to the front of the trailers.  Pallets may only be loaded from the rear.  5.3.2.5.4.   Lashing rings/small “D” rings.  Mounted to the top of the guide rails and held  in  place  by  two  small  bolts.    These  rings  are  used  for  securing  tarpaulins  over cargo only.  Note:  Do not use these rings for securing cargo.  5.3.2.5.5.   Lashing rings/large “D” rings.  Mounted to  the side of the frame running under the bed, there are five large “D” rings that run the length of the trailer on each side.  These rings are the anchoring devices for securing cargo, rated at 10,000 lbs (data plates give the maximum weight limitations on each section of the trailer).  Each pallet must be secured to large “D” ring on BOTH sides of the trailer.  Married pallets must have a minimum of 4 securing devices.  5.3.2.5.6.   Securing cargo.  In order to secure cargo on the 40-foot rollerized trailer:  5.3.2.5.6.1.  Get a pallet count, and attach as many securing devices as possible to the large D rings on each side of the trailer. (Load from the rear and push all the way to the front of the trailer.).  5.3.2.5.6.2.  Once the pallet is against the back of the gooseneck, quickly attach a safety chain to hold it in place until securing devices can be attached properly.  5.3.2.5.6.3.  Attach the securing device on the pallet, ratchet end of the strap to the pallet.  Pull the pallet toward the front of the trailer to where it is secured up against the rear of the gooseneck.  (Repeat on the other side of the pallet.).  5.3.2.5.6.4.  If more than one pallet is being transported, push the second pallet all the way up to the rear of the first pallet.  Attach the safety chain fist and then use the securing devices the same way as previously mentioned.  5.3.2.5.6.5.  When  unloading  pallets:    Leave  one  securing  device  attached  to  the pallet; after forklift or K-loader is in place to receive the pallet  at the end of the trailer and the path of travel is clear; then unfasten.  Note:  Cargo compartments are located on top of the gooseneck.  The lids of the compartment are extremely heavy.  Safety awareness is key; be aware of hand and foot placement and wet surfaces.  5.3.2.5.7.   Loading ramp.  This is attached to the rear of the trailer and has a hydraulic lift installed.  Adjust the height of the ramp as needed to load or unload cargo.   The ramp can be raised by closing the release valve on the hydraulic unit located on the driver side, near the rear of the guide rails.  Remove the two safety pins in the support arms and grab the handle of the hydraulic unit, located below the release valve, and pump the system until the ramp lift is set to the desired height.  Once the ramp is at the desired height, install the pins back into the support arms.  5.3.2.6.  Tilt trailer (22 tons).  This trailer is primarily used to move vehicles and equipment (i.e.  forklifts,  dozers,  etc.)  that  are  not  designed  for  traveling  over  long  stretches  of roadways.  5.3.2.6.1.   Loading procedures.  5.3.2.6.1.1.  Release latch(es) of tilt trailer located in the middle of the trailer.  5.3.2.6.1.2.  Lower trailer ramps (if equipped).  5.3.2.6.1.3.  With engine running, align equipment with the rear of the trailer.  5.3.2.6.1.4.  Raise attachments high enough to clear rear of trailer.  5.3.2.6.1.5.  Using  a  spotter  (See  AFMAN  24-306),  slowly  drive  the  vehicle  or equipment up onto the trailer, making sure it is centered.  5.3.2.6.1.6.  Before reaching the back of the trailer, the bed will tilt back forward.  5.3.2.6.1.7.  Lower attachments and set parking brake.  5.3.2.6.1.8.  Stop engine.  5.3.2.6.1.9.  Secure the piece of equipment to the trailer with chains and binders, along with blocking and bracing the vehicle.  Note:  Be sure that the tilt latch is in the secured position.    5.4. Air Brakes.  5.4.1.  Safe operation of a tractor-trailer with an air brake system.  5.4.1.1.  Safe operation of a CMV with an air brake system, requires knowledge of:  Air Brake System nomenclature; the dangers of contaminated air supply; implications of low air  pressure  readings;  procedures  to  conduct  safe  and  accurate  pre-trip  inspections; procedures for conducting en route and post-trip inspections of air actuated brake systems (ability to detect defects, which may cause the system to fail).  Note:  See the AAMVA CDL Manual for detailed, testable information on the Air Brake System needed to operate the Air Brake System.  5.4.1.2.  The  operator  will  be  required  to  inspect  the  Air  Brake  System  as  a  part  of  the performance test and as a part of the walk-around inspection, for daily operations, once licensed on the vehicle.  When inspecting air brakes, the following are added items to be included in Step 2 “Engine Compartment Checks”, Step 5 “Walk-Around Inspecting”, and Step 7 “Final Air Brake Check” of the Seven-Step Inspection Process.  See Attachment 6.  Note:    If  any  of  the  below  tests  fail,  the  trainee  must  report  them  to  the  VCO/VCNCO,  the supervisor and/or vehicle maintenance.  Figure 5.5.  Air Brakes Inspection.  Additional Steps for Inspecting Air Brakes Step 2.  Engine Compartment Checks 5.  Walk-Around Inspecting 7.  Final Air Brake Check   o o o o   o Procedure Check air compressor drive belt condition and tightness (if compressor is belt driven). Check manual slack adjusters on S-cam brakes.  Note:  Vehicles with automatic slack adjustors still must be checked. Park on level ground and chock the wheels. Release the parking brakes in order to move the slack adjusters. Use gloves and pull hard on each slack adjuster that can be reached. Check slack adjuster, more than 1-inch indicates adjustments required (vehicles with too much brake slack can be very hard to stop).  Adjust it or have it adjusted. Check brake drums (or discs), linings, and hoses. Test low pressure warning signal. Shut the engine off when the vehicle has enough air pressure so that the low pressure warning signal is not on. o o o  o o o o o  o o Turn the electrical power on. Step on and off the brake pedal to reduce air tank pressure. Low air pressure warning signal should come on before the pressure drops to less than 60 psi in the air tank with lowest pressure. Check that the spring brakes come on automatically. Chock the wheels. Release the parking brakes when enough air pressure is built up. Shut the engine off. Step on and off the brake pedal to reduce the air tank pressure. "Parking brake" knob should pop out when the air pressure falls to the manufacturer's specification. Check rate of air pressure buildup Refer to manufacturer’s recommendation for average buildup time. If not within recommended time, the air pressure may drop too low during driving operations. Test air leakage rate.  o  With a fully-charged air system (typically 125 o o o o  o o  o o o psi). Turn-off the engine. Release the service brake and time the air pressure drop. The loss rate should be less than 2 psi in one minute for single vehicles. Not less than 3 psi in 1 minute for combination vehicles. Then apply 90 psi or more with the brake pedal. After the initial pressure drop, if the air pressure falls more than 3 psi in 1 minute for single vehicles. Not more than 4 psi for combination vehicles. Check air compressor governor cut-in and cut-out pressures. Air compressor should start at about 100 psi and stop at about 125 psi. Run the engine at a fast idle. Air governor should cut-out the air compressor at about the manufacturer's specified pressure. o o o       Engine idling, step on and off brake to reduce air tank pressure. Compressor should cut-in at manufacturer's specified cut-in pressure. Test parking brake:  Stop the vehicle; put the parking brake on; gently pull against it in low gear to determine if parking brake will hold. Test service brakes. Wait for normal air pressure. Release the parking brake. Move the vehicle forward slowly (about 5 mph). Apply the brakes firmly using the brake pedal. Note any vehicle "pulling" to one side, unusual feel, or delayed stopping action.  5.5. Vehicle Inspection.

Driving Safety and Precautions.  5.9.1.  Right turns.  5.9.1.1.  Turn slowly, gives the operator and others more time to avoid problems.  5.9.1.2.  Make the right turn without swinging into another lane.  5.9.1.3.  Prevents vehicles passing on the right.  5.9.1.4.  If the trainee must cross into the oncoming lane to make a turn:  Watch for vehicles coming toward the vehicle; give them room to go by; stop; do not back up for them.    5.9.2.  Left turns.  5.9.2.1.  Ensure the vehicle has reached the center of intersection before starting the left turn.  5.9.2.2.  If two left turn lanes, take the right-hand lane. 5.9.3.  Space needed to cross or enter traffic.  5.9.3.1.  Slow acceleration and the space large vehicles require.  5.9.3.2.  Acceleration varies with the load. 5.9.4.  Mountain driving.  5.9.4.1.  Select a "safe" speed, consider these items:  5.9.4.2.  Total weight of vehicle and cargo.  5.9.4.3.  Length of grade.  5.9.4.4.  Steepness of grade.  5.9.4.5.  Road conditions.  5.9.4.6.  Weather.  5.9.4.7.  Select proper gear before starting down grade.   5.9.4.7.1.   Do not attempt to downshift after the vehicle’s speed has already increased. 5.9.4.7.2.   Use lower gears going down a hill than would be required to go up the hill.  5.9.4.8.  Brake fading or failure.  5.9.4.8.1.   Excessive heat caused by overuse.  5.9.4.8.2.   Brake adjustment must be checked frequently.  5.9.4.9.  Proper braking technique.  5.9.4.9.1.   Apply the brakes just hard enough to feel a definite slowdown.  5.9.4.9.2.   When the vehicle’s speed has been reduced to approximately 5 MPH below the "safe" speed, release the brakes.  5.9.4.9.3.   When the vehicle’s speed has increased to the "safe" speed, repeat steps 1 and 2.  5.9.4.10.   Escape ramps.  5.9.4.10.1.   Know escape ramp locations on the route.  5.9.4.10.2.

Driving and Safety Precautions – Combination Vehicles.  5.10.1.  Rollover risks and prevention:  5.10.1.1.   Keep the cargo as close to the ground as possible.  5.10.1.2.   Drive slowly around turns, corners, and on-/off-ramps.    5.10.1.3.   Avoid quick lane changes, especially when fully loaded. 5.10.1.4.   Trucks  with  trailers  can  have  a  dangerous  effect  caused  by  rearward amplification, where the trailer can swing out, then swing back.  Steer gently and smoothly, follow far enough behind other vehicles, look  far enough down the road  to  avoid  being surprised, at night, drive slowly enough to see obstacles with the headlights, slow down to a safe speed before going into a turn.  5.10.1.5.   Brake early.  Combination vehicles take longer to stop when empty.  Allow lots of following distance.  Look ahead in order to brake early.  5.10.1.6.   Prevent trailer skids.  Recognize the skid, when braking, check trailer to ensure it is going straight.  Stop using the brake.  Release the brakes to get traction back.  Do not use trailer hand brake to "straighten out the rig".  5.10.1.7.   Turn wide.  Off tracking, rear wheels follow a different path.  Steer front end wide enough around corners so rear will clear.  Keep the rear of the vehicle close to curb.  Stops  other  drivers  from  passing  the  vehicle  on  the  right.    This  may  require  a  turn  into oncoming lane; watch for oncoming traffic.  This may have to wait until oncoming lane is clear.  5.10.2.  Combination vehicle air brakes.  See Section 5.4. and the AAMVA CDL Manual for additional information on air brakes for single vehicles and combination vehicles.   5.11.  Miscellaneous Tractor-Trailer Vehicle Operations.  5.11.1.  Over-the-road operations.  5.11.1.1.   When starting off in the tractor-trailer combination, ensure that the trailer brakes are not locked up and that the tires are turning freely.  5.11.1.2.   The added weight of the trailer and the equipment being hauled will affect the power of the tractor and the distances required stopping.  5.11.1.3.   Know the height of the trailer and equipment being hauled.  Avoid low bridges and underpasses.  5.11.2.  Unloading procedures.  5.11.2.1.   Remove chains, binders, and blocking and bracing from vehicle or equipment being hauled.  5.11.2.2.   Unlatch tilt trailer locking pin(s).  Note:  Failure to unlatch tilt trailer locking pin will cause damage to trailer.  5.11.2.3.   Lower trailer ramps (if equipped).  5.11.2.4.   Start vehicle or equipment and release parking brake.  5.11.2.5.   Raise any attachment(s) resting on the trailer deck.  5.11.2.6.   Using  a  spotter,  slowly  start  backing  off  the  trailer.    Moving  backwards,  the vehicle will come to a pivot point where the trailer will start to tilt back.  At that point apply the brakes and let the trailer continue to tilt back until it rests on the ground.  5.11.2.7.   Continue backing off, the operator may need raise attachments so they will clear the trailer.  5.11.2.8.   Once the vehicle or equipment is off the trailer, the bed will tilt back to its normal position.  5.11.2.9.   Ensure the tilt lock latches.  5.11.3.  Winches (if equipped).  5.11.3.1.   Winch  cables  (also  called  wire  ropes).    Immediately  have  damaged  cables replaced, failure to do so can result in cable backlash, which may cause injury or death.  The following are items to look for:  5.11.3.1.1.  Properly lubricated.  5.11.3.1.2.  No frays or cuts in cable (See Figure 5.3.).   5.11.3.1.3.  Has not been crushed. 5.11.3.1.4.  No kinks.  5.11.3.1.5.  No bird caging.   The twisting of the  wire  rope in  an isolated area in  the opposite direction of the rope lay, causing it to take on a bird cage appearance.  5.11.3.1.6.  Properly wound on the cable spool.  5.11.3.1.6.1.   Cable fastening devices.  Need to ensure they are properly installed and securely fastened.  Two most common types of fasteners are the U-bolt wire clip and compression sleeve (see Figure 5.4.).  5.11.3.1.6.1.1.  The U-bolt wire clips have a correct and incorrect way of being fastened to the cable (see Figure 5.5.).  The saddle of the clip rests against the ``live'' portion of the wire rope while the U-bolt rests on the short end of the cable  (also  called  the  “dead”  portion  of  the  cable).    Using  clips  improperly severely weakens the connection, making it unsafe.  A good way to remember if fastened correctly is “never saddle a dead horse”.  Figure 5.3.  Cable Frays and Cuts.      Figure 5.4.  Cable U-bolt Wire Clip and Compression Sleeve.   Figure 5.5.  Correct and Incorrect Methods for U-bolt Wire Clips.    5.11.4.  Additional items.   5.11.4.1.   Flightline rules and regulations (when applicable).  Refer to AFMAN 24-306, AFI 13-213 and local flightline procedures.  5.11.4.2.   Fire extinguisher training.  Tractor-trailers are equipped with fire extinguishers and training is required annually.  The supervisor or Squadron VCO will schedule training according to local policy.  The fire extinguisher itself must be inspected to ensure current inspection date, ensure needle is positioned in the green and ensure it is securely mounted.  5.11.4.3.   Workplace policies and procedures.  Understand local policies and procedures in regards to tractor-trailer operations.  At a temporary duty location, take the time to learn the specific policies and procedures for the location.  Section 6—TRAINER’S EXPLANATION AND DEMONSTRATION  6.1. Trainer’s Preparation.  6.1.1.

The examiner provided by the Vehicle Operations Element TVO activity will administer the performance test for the tractor-trailer IAW AFI 24-301 and AFQTP 24-3-200.  7.6.1.1.  The  performance  test,  administered  by  the  TVO  Examiner,  (in  addition  to  the required written test(s)) is the only official evaluation used to license the individual on the tractor-trailer.  7.6.1.2.  The  trainer  will  ensure  that  the  trainee  is  familiar  with  the  components  and structure of the test, the items being evaluated and the minimum standards needed to pass the exam.  7.6.1.3.  The trainee must first pass required written test(s).  See Section 5 for additional information.  7.6.1.4.  The  trainee  will  accomplish  the  performance  test  using  a  tractor-trailer  with manual  transmission.    Note:    In  the  event  that  the  trainee  is  unable  complete  the performance  test  using  a  tractor-trailer  with  manual  transmission,  he/she  will  receive  a license restriction notating a limitation  to  operate only  automatic transmission-equipped tractor-trailers.  7.6.2.  In order to be licensed on the tractor-trailer:  7.6.2.1.  Trainees  assigned  to  an  installation  that  has  not  transitioned  to  the  AAMVA model will successfully accomplish the performance test developed and administered by TVO staff, IAW AFI 24-301.  Note:  The performance test will be developed, by the TVO staff  using  this  lesson  plan  and  will  include,  at  a  minimum,  evaluation  of  the  checklist found in Attachment 3.  7.6.2.2.  Trainees assigned to an installation that has transitioned to the AAMVA model will  successfully  accomplish  the  Air  Force  Performance  Test  administered  by  a  TVO Examiner IAW AFI 24-301 and AFQTP 24-3-200.  7.6.3.  The Air Force Performance Test, for installations using the AAMVA model, consists of three parts:  The Vehicle Inspection Test, Basic Control Skills Test and the Road Test.  7.6.3.1.  Vehicle Inspection Test.  The trainee will be tested to see if he/she knows whether the vehicle is safe to drive.  The trainee will walk around the vehicle and point to or touch each item and explain to the examiner what he/she is inspecting and why.  7.6.3.1.1.   The Vehicle Inspection Test includes an air brakes system check, a walk-around inspection, an in-cab inspection, and a coupling/uncoupling demonstration.  See Attachment  4  of  this  AFQTP  and  Section  11  of  the  AAMVA  CDL  Manual  for additional guidance.  7.6.3.1.2.   The trainee is permitted to use the tractor-trailer vehicle inspection memory aid (Attachment 2) during the Air Force Performance Test.  The examiner will provide a clean copy. 7.6.3.1.3.   The trainee does not need to accomplish an AF Form 1800 during the Air Force Performance Test. 7.6.3.1.4.   Automatic failures.  Automatic failures will result in the immediate termination of the Performance Test.  See Attachment 4 for a list of automatic failures applicable to the Air Force Performance Test, Vehicle Inspection Test.    7.6.3.1.4.1.  If the trainee fails the Vehicle Inspection Test, the remainder of the test will be terminated.  Retraining and re-examination will be conducted IAW AFI 24-301 and AFQTP 24-3-200. 7.6.3.1.4.2.  If a trainee fails  any component of the  Air Force  Performance Test, he/she will be required to retake the Air Force Performance Test, in its entirety.   7.6.3.2.  Basic Control Skills Test.  The trainee will be tested on his/her skill to control the vehicle.  The trainee will be asked to move the vehicle forward, backward, and turn it with a defined area.  These areas may be marked with traffic lanes, cones, barriers or something similar.  The examiner will explain how to complete each control test.  See Attachment 4 of this AFQTP and Section 12 of the AAMVA CDL Manual for additional guidance and for descriptions of the required maneuvers.  7.6.3.2.1.   Required Basic Control Skills Test maneuvers:  7.6.3.2.1.1.  Straight line backing.  7.6.3.2.1.2.  Offset back/right or offset back left.  7.6.3.2.1.3.  Parallel  park  (operator  side),  parallel  park  (conventional)  or  alley dock.  7.6.3.2.2.   Basic Control Skills Test Scoring.  7.6.3.2.2.1.  Encroachments.  The examiner will score the number of times that the trainee touches or crosses over an exercise boundary line or cone with any portion of the vehicle.  Each encroachment will count as an error.  7.6.3.2.2.2.  Pull-ups.    When  an  operator  stops  and  pulls  forward  to  clear  an encroachment or to get a better position, it is scored as a pull-up.  Stopping without changing directions does not count as a pull-up.  The trainee will not be penalized for initial pull-ups.  However, an excessive number of pull-ups, will count as errors.  7.6.3.2.2.3.  Outside vehicle observations (Looks).  The trainee may be permitted to  safely  stop  and  exit  the  vehicle  to  check  the  external  position  of  the  vehicle (look).  When doing so, the trainee must place the vehicle in  neutral and  set  the parking brake(s).  If exiting the vehicle, the trainee must do so safely by facing the vehicle and maintaining three points of contact with the vehicle at all times.  If the trainee does not safely secure the vehicle or safely exit the vehicle may result in an automatic failure of the basic control skills test.  7.6.3.2.2.3.1.  The maximum number of times that the trainee may look to check the  position  of  the  vehicle  is  two  (2)  except  for  the  Straight  Line  Backing exercise, which allows one look.  Each time the operator opens the door, moves from a seated position where in physical control of the vehicle, it is scored as a “look”.  7.6.3.2.2.4.  Final  position/inside  parallel.    It  is  important  that  the  trainee  finish each  exercise  exactly  as  the  examiner  has  instructed.    If  the  trainee  does  not maneuver the vehicle into its final position as described by the examiner, the trainee will be penalized and could fail the basic skills test.  7.6.3.2.3.   Automatic  failures.    Automatic  failures  will  result  in  the  immediate termination  of  the  Air  Force  Performance  Test.    See  Attachment  4  for  a  list  of automatic  failures  applicable  to  the  Basic  Control  Skills  Test.    If  a  trainee  fails  any component of the Air Force Performance Test, he/she will be required to retake the Air Force Performance Test, in its entirety.  7.6.3.3.  Road Test.  The trainee will be tested on his/her skill to safely operate the vehicle in  a  variety  of  traffic  situations.    The  situations  will  include  left  and  right  turns, intersections, railroad crossings, curves, up and down grades, single and multi-lane roads, streets and highways.  The examiner will tell the trainee where to drive.  7.6.3.3.1.   The following maneuvers will be demonstrated on the on the road test (See Section  13  of  the  AAMVA  CDL  Manual  and  Attachment  4  of  this  AFQTP  for additional guidance and detailed descriptions of each maneuver):  7.6.3.3.1.1.  Turns (Left/Right).  7.6.3.3.1.2.  Intersections.  7.6.3.3.1.3.  Urban/rural straight.  7.6.3.3.1.4.  Expressway.  7.6.3.3.1.5.  Start/stop.  7.6.3.3.1.6.  Curves (Left/Right).  7.6.3.3.1.7.

Supply Air to Trailer   Check position, using outside mirrors, by looking down both sides of the trailer.   Back until fifth wheel just touches the trailer.   Don’t hit the trailer.   Put on the parking brake.   Put transmission in neutral.   The trailer should be low enough that it is raised slightly by the tractor when the tractor is backed under it.  Raise or lower the trailer as needed.  (If the trailer is too low, the tractor may strike and damage the trailer nose; if the trailer is too high, it may not couple correctly).   Check that the kingpin and fifth wheel are aligned.   Check glad hand seals and connect tractor emergency air-line to trailer emergency glad hand.   Check glad hand seals and connect tractor service air-line to trailer service glad hand.   Make sure air-lines are safely supported where they won’t be crushed or caught while tractor is backing under the trailer.   Ensure trailer is chocked.   From cab, push in “air supply” knob or move tractor protection valve control from the “emergency” to the “normal” position to supply air to the trailer brake system.   Wait until the air pressure is normal.   Check brake system for crossed air-lines.   Shut engine off so the operator can hear the brakes.   Apply and release trailer brakes and listen for sound of trailer brakes being applied and released.  The operator should hear the brakes move when applied and air escape when the brakes are released.   Check air brake system pressure gauge for signs of major air loss.   When the operator is sure trailer brakes are working, start engine.   Make sure air pressure is up to normal.   Pull out the “air supply” knob or move the tractor protection valve control from “normal” to “emergency.”   Use lowest reverse gear.   Back tractor slowly under trailer to avoid hitting the kingpin too hard.   Stop when the kingpin is locked into the fifth wheel. 9.  Lock Trailer Brakes 10.  Back Under Trailer 11.  Check Connection for Security   Raise trailer landing gear slightly off the ground.   Pull tractor gently forward while the trailer brakes are still locked to check that the trailer is locked onto the tractor.   Put transmission in neutral.   Put parking brakes on.   Shut off engine and take key with so someone else won’t move truck while the operator is under it. 12.  Secure Vehicle   13.  Inspect Coupling 14.  Connect the Electrical Cord and Check Air-Lines 15.  Raise Front Trailer Supports (Landing Gear)   Use a flashlight, if necessary.   Make sure there is no space between upper and lower fifth wheel.  If there is a space between upper and lower fifth wheel.  If there is space, something is wrong (kingpin may be on top of the closed fifth wheel jaws, and trailer would come lose very easily).   Go under trailer and look into the back of the fifth wheel.  Make sure the fifth wheel jaws have closed around the shank of the kingpin.   Check that the locking lever is in the “lock” position.   Check that the safety latch is in position over locking lever.  (On some fifth wheels the catch must be put in place by hand).  If the coupling isn’t right, don’t drive the coupled unit; get it fixed.   Plug the electrical cord into the trailer and fasten the safety catch.   Check both air-lines and electrical line for signs of damage.   Make sure air and electrical lines will not hit any moving parts of vehicle.   Use low gear range (if so equipped) to begin raising the landing gear.  Once free of weight, switch to the high gear range.   Raise the landing gear all the way up.  (Never drive with landing gear only part way up as it may catch on railroad tracks or other things.)   After raising landing gear, secure the crank handle safely.   When full weight of trailer is resting on tractor:   Check for enough clearance between rear of tractor frame and landing gear. (When tractor turns sharply, it must not hit landing gear).   Check that there is enough clearance between the top of the tractor tires and the nose of the trailer. 16.  Remove Trailer Wheel Chocks   Remove and store wheel chocks in a safe place.  Figure A5.2.  Uncoupling Tractor-Semitrailers.  Uncoupling Tractor-Semitrailers Step Procedure 1.  Position Tractor-Trailer   Make sure surface of parking area can support weight of trailer.   Have tractor lined up with the trailer. (Pulling out at an angle can damage landing gear.) 2.  Ease Pressure on Locking-Jaws   Shut off trailer air supply to lock trailer brakes.   Ease pressure on fifth wheel locking jaws by backing up gently. (This will help release the fifth wheel locking lever.)   Put parking brakes on while tractor is pushing against the kingpin. (This will hold rig with pressure off the locking jaws.)   Chock the trailer wheels if the trailer doesn't have spring brakes or if uncertain.  (The air could leak out of the trailer air tank, releasing its emergency brakes. Without chocks, the trailer could move.)  If trailer is empty, lower the landing gear until it makes firm contact with the ground. 3.  Chock Trailer Wheels 4.  Lower the Landing Gear  If trailer is loaded, after the landing gear makes firm contact with the ground, turn crank in low gear a few extra turns. This will lift some weight off the tractor. (Do not lift trailer off the fifth wheel.)   This will: o  Make it easier to unlatch fifth wheel. o  Make it easier to couple next time. 5.  Disconnect Air Lines and Electrical Cable   Disconnect air-lines from trailer. 6.  Unlock Fifth Wheel Connect air-line glad hands to dummy couplers at back of cab or couple them together.   Hang electrical cable with plug down to prevent moisture from entering it.   Make sure lines are supported so they won't be damaged while driving the tractor.   Raise the release handle lock.   Pull the release handle to "open" position.   Keep legs and feet clear of the rear tractor wheels to avoid serious injury in case the vehicle moves. 7.  Pull Tractor Partially Clear of Trailer   Pull tractor forward until fifth wheel comes out from under the trailer.   Stop with tractor frame under trailer (prevents trailer from falling to ground if landing gear should collapse or sink).   Apply parking brake.   Place transmission in neutral.   Make sure ground is supporting trailer.   Make sure landing gear is not damaged.   Release parking brakes.   Check the area and drive tractor forward until it clears. 8.  Secure Trailer 9.  Inspect Trailer Supports 10.  Pull Tractor Clear of Trailer    Attachment 6 SEVEN-STEP INSPECTION PROCESS  Figure A6.1.  Seven-Step Inspection Process.

Start the Engine and Check Test for Hydraulic Leaks o o  o o o   o o o o o  o o o o Secure all loose articles in cab (they might interfere with operation of the controls or hit the operator in a crash). Start the engine. Test for hydraulic leaks. If the vehicle has hydraulic brakes, pump the brake pedal three times. Then apply firm pressure to the pedal and hold for five seconds. The pedal should not move.  If it does, there may be a leak or other problem. Brake system. Test parking brake. Fasten safety belt. Set parking brake (power unit only). Release trailer parking brake (if applicable). Place vehicle into a low gear. Gently pull forward against parking brake to make sure the parking brake holds. Repeat the same steps for the trailer with trailer parking brake set and power unit parking brakes released (if applicable). If it doesn't hold vehicle, it is faulty; get it fixed. Test service brake stopping action. Go about 5 miles per hour. Push brake pedal firmly. "Pulling" to one side or the other can mean brake trouble. Any unusual brake pedal "feel" or delayed stopping action can mean trouble.   o  o o o o o o o  o  If the trainee finds anything unsafe during the Vehicle inspection, get it fixed. Federal and state laws forbid operating an unsafe vehicle. Check vehicle operation regularly: Instruments. Air pressure gauge (if the vehicle has air brakes). Temperature gauges. Pressure gauges. Ammeter/voltmeter. Mirrors. Tires. Cargo, cargo covers. Lights, etc. If the trainee sees, hears, smells, or feels anything that might mean trouble, he/she should check it out. Safety inspection. Drivers of trucks and truck tractors when transporting cargo must inspect the securement of the cargo within the first 50 miles of a trip and every 150 miles or every 3 hours (whichever comes first) after. Document any discrepancy on AF Form 1800.  Sign-off AF Form 1800 to signify accomplishment of inspection.    Figure A6.2.  Additional Steps for Inspecting Air Brakes System.  Additional Steps for Inspecting Air Brakes Step 2.  Engine Compartment Checks 5.  Walk-Around Inspecting 7.  Final Air Brake Check   o o o o   o o o o  o o o o o  o Procedure Check air compressor drive belt condition and tightness (if compressor is belt driven). Check manual slack adjusters on S-cam brakes.  Note:  Vehicles with automatic slack adjustors still must be checked. Park on level ground and chock the wheels. Release the parking brakes so the operator can move the slack adjusters. Use gloves and pull hard on each slack adjuster that it can be reached. Check slack adjuster, more than 1-inch indicates adjustments required (vehicles with too much brake slack can be very hard to stop).  Adjust it or have it adjusted. Check brake drums (or discs), linings, and hoses. Test low pressure warning signal. Shut the engine off when the vehicle has enough air pressure so that the low pressure warning signal is not on. Turn the electrical power on. Step on and off the brake pedal to reduce air tank pressure. Low air pressure warning signal should come on before the pressure drops to less than 60 psi in the air tank with lowest pressure. Check that the spring brakes come on automatically. Chock the wheels. Release the parking brakes when enough air pressure is built up. Shut the engine off. Step on and off the brake pedal to reduce the air tank pressure. "Parking brake" knob should pop out when the air pressure falls to the manufacturer's specification. Check rate of air pressure buildup Refer to manufacturer’s recommendation for average buildup time.   o If not within recommended time, the air pressure may drop too low during driving operations. Test air leakage rate.  o  With a fully-charged air system (typically 125 o o o o  o o  o o o o o o       psi). Turn-off the engine. Release the service brake and time the air pressure drop. The loss rate should be less than 2 psi in one minute for single vehicles. Not less than 3 psi in 1 minute for combination vehicles. Then apply 90 psi or more with the brake pedal. After the initial pressure drop, if the air pressure falls more than 3 psi in 1 minute for single vehicles. Not more than 4 psi for combination vehicles. Check air compressor governor cut-in and cut-out pressures. Air compressor should start at about 100 psi and stop at about 125 psi. Run the engine at a fast idle. Air governor should cut-out the air compressor at about the manufacturer's specified pressure. Engine idling, step on and off brake to reduce air tank pressure. Compressor should cut-in at manufacturer's specified cut-in pressure. Test parking brake:  Stop the vehicle; put the parking brake on; gently pull against it in low gear to determine if parking brake will hold. Test service brakes. Wait for normal air pressure. Release the parking brake. Move the vehicle forward slowly (about 5 mph). Apply the brakes firmly using the brake pedal. Note any vehicle "pulling" to one side, unusual feel, or delayed stopping action.
