In addition, pilots will  refer  to  the  Bombardier  Global  Express  Configuration  Deviation  List  (CDL),  the  FAA AFI11-2E-11V3  12 SEPTEMBER 2017 7 Global  Express  Master  Minimum  Equipment  List  (MMEL)  and  the  Restriction/Special Instructions (RSI) to determine if the aircraft is able to execute the mission.  The Configuration Deviation List (CDL) will be referenced for any airframe deviations.  MAJCOMs may authorize the use of electronic flight bags. 1.8.  Distribution.  Issue this volume to E-11A aircrew members IAW local procedures. 8 AFI11-2E-11V3  12 SEPTEMBER 2017 Chapter 2 COMMAND AND CONTROL 2.1.  Responsibility and Authority.  The responsibility of mission planning and execution rests with  the  Aircraft  Commander  (AC).    Preparation  for  the  mission  tasking  and  subsequent execution  support  is  the  coordinated  responsibility  of  liaison  officers  and  the  BACN  Mission Coordinator (BMC).  Operations functions of the unit will support both efforts. 2.2.  Pilot  in  Command  (PIC)  Responsibility  and  Authority  .    SQ/CCs  shall  designate  an aircraft commander (AC), instructor pilot (IP), or evaluator (EP) as the PIC for all flights, on a flight authorization form, IAW AFI 11-401, Aviation Management, and applicable supplements.  PICs are: 2.2.1.  In command of all persons aboard the aircraft. 2.2.2.  Vested  with  authority  to  accomplish  the  assigned  mission.    The  PIC  shall  only  fly events  authorized  in  the  mission  tasking  unless,  in  the  PICs  judgement,  an  emergency condition demands otherwise. 2.2.3.  The final mission authority and will make decisions not assigned to higher authority. 2.2.4.  The final authority for requesting or accepting aircrew or mission waivers. 2.2.5.  Responsible for passing mission progress reports to C2 agents. 2.2.6.  Responsible for interaction between aircrew members and mission support personnel. 2.2.7.  Responsible for the welfare of aircrew members, Mission Essential Personnel (MEP) and the safe accomplishment of the mission. 2.3.  Mission  Clearance  Decision.  The  execution  authority  and  PIC  shall  make  the  mission clearance decision.  In all cases, final responsibility for the safe conduct of the mission rests with the PIC.  If a PIC elects to delay a mission, that mission will not depart until the conditions that generated  the  decision  to  delay  improve  or  are  resolved.    Furthermore,  no  execution  authority may task another PIC to take the same mission under the same conditions. 2.4.  Mission Commander (MC).  Unit Commanders shall designate a MC when more than two aircraft  are  assembled  to  perform  a  mission  away  from  home  station/main  operating  location.  Unit  commanders  should  consider  appointing  a  MC  for  special,  high-visibility  missions.    The MC  has  overall  responsibility  and  is  the  final  authority  for  decisions  that  impact  mission execution. 2.5.  Mission Planning Requirements. 2.5.1.  Briefings/Debriefings.    The  AC  and  CP  will  brief/debrief  the  BACN  Mission Coordinator  (BMC)  members  to  ensure  safe,  effective  mission  accomplishment.  (T-2).  Locally-developed briefing guides (developed IAW AFI 11-202V3) will be used to provide a reference of items that apply to a particular mission and will be used as a basis for mission planning  and  briefing  actions.    Those  understood  by  all  participants  may  be  briefed  as “standard”.  All required members will attend the briefings unless excused by the AC/BMC. ac).  Note: Units will develop and document guidance for items that are commonly briefed as “Standard”.    The  purpose  of  unit  or  local  standards  is  to  reduce  the  briefing  time  of AFI11-2E-11V3  12 SEPTEMBER 2017 9 administrative  tasks  to  allow  for  concentration  on  the  mission.    In  no  case  do  these procedures  relieve  the  aircrew  of  the  responsibility  to  comply  with  USAF  directives.  Aircrew  will  use  these  procedures  unless  conditions,  objectives,  or  execution  dictate  the aircraft commander to brief as “non-standard.” 2.5.1.1.  Aircraft  and  Aircrew  status.  Aircrew  status  will  be  obtained  on  the  day  of  the flight from ARMS personnel.  Aircraft status will be obtained prior to the crew stepping to the aircraft, to include open discrepancies detailed in the E-11A maintenance binders. 2.5.1.1.1.  Aircraft  maintenance  documentation  provided  to  the  flight  crew  by  the maintenance  contractor  is  maintained  IAW  FAA  standards  and  differs  from  AFTO Form  781s.    Dispatch  release  may  only  be  authorized  by  the  contractor’s  quality assurance representative. 2.5.1.1.2.  If  dispatched  with  an  MMEL,  Crew  Alerting  System  (CAS)  Relief deviation or manufacturer waiver for flight, the PIC will ensure proper documentation is posted in the aircraft forms. 2.5.1.2.  Orbit  Planning.  The  PIC  will  coordinate  with  the  BMC  to  determine  orbit limitations,  based  on  tasking,  and  verify  coordinates/dimensions  of  any  new  orbits  not previously depicted in the mission binder. 2.6.  Airborne  Command  and  Control.  On operational  missions, crews will maintain contact with the mission’s BMC. 2.7.  Law Enforcement Support.  It is the procedure of the Department of Defense (DOD) to be prepared  to  support  civilian  law  enforcement  agencies  consistent  with  the  needs  of  military preparedness of the United States, while recognizing and conforming to the legal limitations on direct DoD involvement in civilian law enforcement activities.  AFI 10-801, Defense Support of Civil  Authorities,  provides  policies  and  procedures  service  members  must  follow  when supporting federal, state and local civilian law enforcement agencies.  Coordinate all civilian law enforcement authorities’ requests for assistance through appropriate C2 channels. 10 AFI11-2E-11V3  12 SEPTEMBER 2017 Chapter 3 AIRCREW COMPLEMENT/MANAGEMENT 3.1.  General.  This  chapter  provides  guiding  principles  to  form/manage  E-11A  aircrews.  Commanders  at  all  levels  shall  follow  these  policies  to  form  aircrews  and  to  develop  aircrew-related work/rest schedules that optimize efficiency of forces engaged in worldwide operations. 3.2.  Aircrew  Complement.  SQ/CCs  shall  form  aircrews  based  on  mission  directive,  Crew Duty  Time  (CDT)  and  Flight  Duty  Period  (FDP)  requirements,  aircrew  member  qualifications and other constraints to safely accomplish the mission tasking. 3.2.1.  Minimum crew complement for operations are two Mission Pilots (MPs) (basic crew).  An  augmented  crew  consists  of  three  pilots.    At  least  two  MPs,  Instructor  Pilots  (IPs),  or Evaluator Pilots (EPs) will be part of an augmented crew if the third pilot is a First Pilot (FP). 3.2.2.  Normally, aircrew manning for operational employment will be IAW AFI 65-503, US Air Force Cost and Planning Factors, Table A36-1.  These tables do not exist due to current program  status.    As  the  program  transitions  to  full  Program  of  Record  these  tables  will  be built and this volume will be amended and/or updated. 3.3.  Crew  Qualifications.  Primary  crewmembers  must  be  qualified  or  in  training  for qualification to occupy a crew position. 3.4.  Unqualified  Crewmembers.  An  IP  must  supervise  non-current  or  unqualified  pilots regaining  currency  or  qualification  (direct  IP  supervision,  in  the  seat,  during  takeoffs,  landings and emergency procedures). 3.5.  Crew  Rest/Flight  Duty  Period/Crew  Augmentation.  Crew  rest,  flight  duty  period  and crew augmentation will be IAW AFI 11-202V3 and applicable MAJCOM supplements with the following additional guidance: 3.5.1.  If  any  axis  of  the  autopilot  is  inoperative,  limit  basic  flight  duty  period  (FDP)  to  12 hours and augmented FDP to 16 hours. (T-2). 3.5.2.  Unless directed otherwise, aircrew members will automatically enter official crew rest NLT 12-hours prior to the start of their next scheduled FDP.  FDP begins 30 minutes prior to scheduled mission brief time.  FDP ends at engine shutdown.  Crews will not enter crew rest until  official  duties  are  complete.    Operations  Supervisors  will  notify  crews  of  mission timeline changes prior to entry into crew rest.  Crews will not be interrupted during the crew rest period unless absolutely essential.  Individuals performing Operations Supervisor duties should show with crew rest for their respective line in the event they are needed to replace a flying crewmember. 3.5.3.  Standby  pilots  are  those  not  required  for  flying/Operations  Supervisor  duties.    All standby pilots should comply with crew rest requirements. 3.6.  Pre-Mission  Duties.  The  AC,  in  coordination  with  the  Sq/CC  or  DO,  may  adjust  crew report  time  to  meet  mission  requirements.    Crew  report  times  will  allow  sufficient  time  to accomplish  all  preflight  activities.    Aircrews  are  scheduled  for,  and  are  typically  expected  to show 1+30 hours prior to takeoff time. AFI11-2E-11V3  12 SEPTEMBER 2017 11 3.7.  Transportation  of  Passengers.  Space-A  passengers  shall  not  fly  on  the  E-11A  due  to mission and training requirements. 3.8.  Mission Essential Personnel (MEP).  IAW AFI 11-401, Aviation Management.  MEP will not  be listed on the AFTO Form 781, will not  log time and will not  accrue Operational  Flying Duty  Accumulation  (OFDA)  credit.    Crewmembers  may  travel  as  MEP  for  a  maximum  of  72 hours.  OG/CC or equivalent may approve crewmembers to travel as MEP in excess of 72 hours. 3.8.1.  Current/qualified aircrew members may perform primary aircrew duties after traveling in MEP status, provided they do not exceed a basic FDP 3.9.  Aircrew  Member  Support.  Crew  rest  is  required  IAW  AFI  11-202V3  when  aircrew members are supporting aircraft generation activities (pre-flight, start and taxi of aircraft).  The duty day begins when the aircrew member reports for official duties or 30 minutes prior to brief time, if required. 3.10.  Debriefings. 3.10.1.  Conduct the maintenance debriefing as soon as practical after engine shutdown. 3.10.2.  If required, conduct an intelligence debriefing. 3.10.3.  Conduct a crew debriefing with BMC and supporting agencies. 12 AFI11-2E-11V3  12 SEPTEMBER 2017 Chapter 4 AIRCRAFT OPERATING RESTRICTIONS 4.1.  Objectives.  The  final  authority  regarding  equipment  required  for  a  mission  rests  with  the PIC.  If one crew accepts an aircraft to operate a mission or mission segment without an item or system,  this  acceptance  does  not  commit  the  crew,  or  a  different  crew,  to  accept  subsequent operations with the same item or system inoperative.  When the PIC considers an item essential, the item will be repaired or replaced prior to departure. 4.2.  Guidance.  This chapter provides guidance on how to operate with degraded equipment.  If the  PIC  elects  to  operate  with  degraded  equipment  or  aircraft  system(s),  coordinate  mission requirements  (i.e.  revised  departure  times,  fuel  requirements,  maintenance  requirements,  etc.), prior to flight with the mission control agency to ensure the decision does not adversely impact follow-on missions. 4.3.  Minimum  Equipment  List.  Commercial  derivatives  have  extensive  Master  Minimum Equipment Lists (MMELs) that provide guidance to support safe dispatch decisions regarding E-11A Aircraft.  The Federal Aviation Administration MMEL for Bombardier Global Express BD-700-1A10 aircraft will be utilized as the approved MEL for E-11 operations in accordance with FAR Part 91 operations.  The MMEL is not intended for continued operations over an indefinite period with systems/subsystems inoperative.  Crews will adhere to guidance and repairs will be completed by the times established in the MMEL. 4.3.1.  All  emergency  equipment  will  be  installed  and  operational  unless  specifically exempted by mission requirements/directives. 4.4.  Dispatching  with  Inoperable  Equipment.  The  PIC  is  responsible  for  exercising  the necessary judgment to ensure aircraft are not dispatched with multiple items inoperative that may result  in  an  unsafe  degradation  and/or  an  undue  increase  in  crew  workload.    The  possibility  of additional failures during continued operation with inoperative systems or components shall also be considered. 4.4.1.  Determining Suitability for Dispatch.  PICs will reference Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) 1, QRH 2, and the MMEL. The Go/No-Go Section in QRH1 does not supersede data outlined in the MMEL.  A “GO” condition still requires MMEL consultation. 4.4.2.  For  operational  missions,  do  not  dispatch  until  the  BMC  reports  the  payload  is “GREEN”.    If  payload  indicates  “YELLOW”  or  “RED,”  coordination  to  reposition  the aircraft prior to taxi may be required. 4.5.  One-Time  Flight  Authorizations.  One-time  flight  authorizations  to  repair  facilities  may be authorized by the OG/CC.  If an aircraft has a safety-of-flight condition beyond the immediate or final repair capability of an en-route facility, temporary repairs may be made to allow a one-time flight to a facility capable of final repair. AFI11-2E-11V3  12 SEPTEMBER 2017 13 Chapter 5 GENERAL OPERATING PROCEDURES 5.1.  Aircrew Uniforms. 5.1.1.  See AFI 11-301V1, Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) Program, for minimum aircrew clothing requirements. (T-1).  All aircrew members will have flight gloves readily available. (T-1).   When  the  Foreign  Clearance  Guide  (FCG)  requires  civilian  attire,  dress conservatively. 5.2.  Personal Requirements and Professional Equipment. 5.2.1.  Passports.  Carry passports on missions when required by the FCG. 5.2.2.  Immunizations.  Aircrew members will ensure they meet immunization requirements for the mission. 5.2.3.  Identification Tags.  Identification tags should be worn around the neck or carried in a flight suit pocket. 5.2.4.  Carry a headset and operational flashlight on all flights. 5.2.5.  Keep equipment clear of all entry doors, hatches and emergency equipment during all ground and flight operations. It is the responsibility of each crewmember to store/secure their personal and professional equipment carried onboard. Excess personal and professional gear should be secured. 5.3.  Aircrew  Publications  Requirements.  The PIC will ensure the following publications are on the aircraft prior to departure: 5.3.1.

When  consulting  the  AMC  Giant  Report  for  suitability,  areas  suitable  for  the  C-37 are also suitable for the E-11A. 5.13.5.  Minimum Taxiway Width is 25 feet (8 meters). 5.13.6.  Minimum Width for a 180 degree turn is 68 feet (22 meters). 5.14.  Taxi Clearance.  Without wing walkers, avoid taxi obstructions by at least 25 feet.  With wing  walkers,  avoid  taxi  obstructions  by  at  least  10  feet.    Exception:  Aircraft  at  home  station AFI11-2E-11V3  12 SEPTEMBER 2017 15 may delete wing walker restriction IAW AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movement on the Ground. 5.14.1.  When taxi clearance is doubtful, use one or more wing walkers.  The PIC should use marshallers  or  wing  walkers  to  act  as  an  observer  while  maneuvering  on  narrow  taxiways.  During night taxi operations, marshallers will have an illuminated wand in each hand. 5.14.2.  Maximum taxi speed in congested areas or turns is 10 knots.  Maximum taxi speed in uncongested areas and straight taxiways is 25 knots. 5.15.  Foreign Object Damage (FOD) Avoidance.  Make every effort to minimize the potential for engine FOD.  Crews should: 5.15.1.  Minimize power settings during all taxi operations. 5.15.2.  Avoid unnecessary use of thrust reversers. 5.16.  Takeoff or Landing over Raised Arresting Cables. 5.16.1.  Takeoffs will normally commence from the approach end of the runway. 5.16.1.1.  Do  not  taxi  over  loose  objects  or  arresting  cables  at  speeds  in  excess  of  10 knots.  Aircraft may takeoff immediately past the approach end arresting cable provided that the takeoff data is recomputed for the new runway takeoff position and OEI gradients are still met. 5.16.2.  Do not land on a raised arresting cable.  Damage may occur to the cable or aircraft. 5.16.3.  Do  not  land  over  a  raised  arresting  barrier  such  as  an  MA-1A.    This  does  not preclude landing over a Barrier Arresting Kit (BAK) 12/14 or other cables. 5.16.4.  Do not takeoff or land over a raised arresting cable that has been reported as slack, loose or improperly rigged. 5.17.  Takeoff and Landing. 5.17.1.  The  left  seat  pilot  will  normally  land  during  aircraft  emergencies.    A  certified Instructor Pilot may takeoff or land from either seat under any condition. 5.18.  Takeoff and Landing Data (TOLD).  TOLD will be verified IAW the AFM.  As a guide, both crewmembers will verify data entry into the Flight Management System (FMS). 5.18.1.  SDPs  are  authorized  for  use.    Crew  members  will  be  trained  in  MAJCOM  SDP operations prior to use. 5.18.2.  Crews will use the full runway length to the maximum extent possible.  Intersection takeoffs  may  be  used  if  full  runway  length  is  not  available  and  aircraft  weight  allows  for obstacle clearance IAW AFI 11-202v3. 5.19.  Adverse Weather. 5.19.1.  Flight into areas of forecast or reported severe icing is prohibited. (T-2).  Prolonged operation, such as cruise flight or holding, in areas of moderate icing should be avoided. 5.19.1.1.  Do not takeoff under conditions of freezing rain or freezing drizzle. (T-2). 16 AFI11-2E-11V3  12 SEPTEMBER 2017 5.19.1.2.  Freezing precipitation, snow, freezing fog, or temperatures near 0°C, may cause ice  or  frost  to  accumulate  on  aircraft  surfaces.    When  an  aircraft  requires  de-icing/anti-icing prior to takeoff, refer to the following: 5.19.1.2.1.  Aircrews  will  only  use  de-ice  and  anti-ice  fluids  listed  in  the  AFM  or approved by the aircraft manufacturer.  Aircrews will be familiar with, and follow all restrictions in the AFM with respect to anti-ice/de-ice procedures and holdover times. 5.19.1.2.2.  Refer to FCOM 1 Chapter 7 for holderover times for Type 1 de-ice fluid. 5.19.1.2.2.1.  In  all  cases,  PICs  will  ensure  a  visual  inspection  of  the  aircraft  is completed  within  5  minutes  of  departure.    In  addition  to  a  visual  inspection,  a tactile  inspection  may  be  required  within  5  minutes  of  departure  per  the  AFP.  The PIC will conduct a tactile inspection as necessary IAW the AFP. 5.19.2.  Flight into areas of forecast or reported severe turbulence is prohibited. (T-2). 5.19.2.1.  The  AC  is  responsible  for  ensuring  any  additional  personnel  are  seated,  with seat  belts  fastened,  when  areas  of  moderate  or  greater  turbulence  are  encountered  or anticipated.    WARNING:  Serious  injury  may  occur  if  personnel  do  not  have  their  seat belts fastened and the aircraft encounters moderate or severe turbulence. 5.20.  Wind  Restrictions.  Airfields  will  be  considered  unusable  for  takeoff  and  landing  when (including gusts): 5.20.1.  Maximum Wind Any Direction is 50 knots. 5.20.2.  Maximum Tailwind Component is 10 knots. 5.20.3.  Maximum Crosswind Component is 29 knots. 5.21.  Bird strikes. 5.21.1.  Following a bird strike, aircrews should land as soon as conditions permit to have the aircraft inspected by qualified maintenance personnel.  Aircrews involved in a wildlife strike will  fill  out  an  AF  Form  853,  Air  Force  Wildlife  Strike  Report,  and  forward  to  the appropriate safety office. 5.21.2.  Bird  strike  damage  cannot  be  accurately  assessed  in-flight,  and  undetected  damage may result in a complex airborne emergency.  Only qualified maintenance personnel on the ground can make reliable damage assessments. 5.21.3.  Aircrews  should  not  change  the  aircraft  configuration  until  it  has  been  determined that  it  is  safe  to  do  so.    However,  crewmember  judgment  should  always  prevail  in  any situation when making a decision concerning safety of the aircrew and aircraft. 5.22.  Radar  Altimeter.  Any  crewmember  detecting  any  low  altitude  warning  of  the  radar altimeter  will  immediately  notify  the  PF.    Terrain  clearance  and  aircraft  position  must  be verified. 5.23.  Use of Automation.  It is the responsibility of the crew to fully understand the operations and  limitations  of  the  automation  on  the  aircraft.    In  flight,  the  PF  will  determine  the  most desirable level of automation for a given situation. AFI11-2E-11V3  12 SEPTEMBER 2017 17 5.23.1.  Use appropriate levels of automation as required by the flight  conditions.  The first priority  is  to  fly  the  aircraft.    The  FMS  and  Guidance  Panel  (GP)  are  intended  to  aid  in workload management, not complicate it. 5.23.2.  Avoid  the  following  common  pitfalls  associated  with  over-reliance,  misuse,  or misunderstanding of automation: 5.23.2.1.  Fixating on the automation. One pilot should always remain heads up. Establish clear  roles  for  computer  related  tasks.    Announce  “pilot  heads  down”  when  the  task requires focusing significant attention on the FMS in flight. 5.23.2.2.  Poor  Prioritization  of  programming  tasks.  Extensive  reprogramming  during critical phases of flight or during periods of high workload should be avoided. 5.23.2.3.  Poor  Mode  awareness.  The  PF  should  monitor  flight  mode  annunciations  and make GP changes during coupled operations.  Programming the FMS should be verified by PF prior to coupling the programmed route to the autopilot.  During uncoupled flight, the  PF  should  direct  the  PM  to  make  changes  to  the  GP  to  match  the  flight  director.  Confirm all mode changes by observing the correct flight mode annunciations. 5.23.2.4.  Mis-management of Altitude Preselect. The PM should set the cleared altitude in the PFD.  The altitude shall be confirmed. 5.23.3.  Units  will  develop  their  own  standard  operating  procedures  (SOPs),  supplementing Global Express ORM automation guidance, in their local procedures. (T-3). 5.24.  On-Station Procedures. 5.24.1.  Prior  to  orbit  intercept,  the  AC/PIC  will  confirm  the  type  of  orbit  and  airspace limitations that may alter the planned orbit. 5.24.2.  Should the orbit be a “Special Mission” orbit, the AC/PIC will confirm the airspeed prior to entering the orbit as commanded airspeed will change from mach to KIAS. 5.24.3.  The BMC will monitor aircraft position and immediately inform the aircrew of any identified deviations from the planned orbit. 5.24.4.  Aircraft  Recall/Diversion.  Unless  received  over  secured  communications  or  via appropriate  SPINS  code  word,  challenge  any  recall  or  diversion  order  using  appropriate theater procedures. 5.25.  Enroute Navigation. 5.25.1.  Performance  Specification  Airspace.    The  E-11A  Communication  Navigation Surveillance/Air  Traffic  Management located  within Bombardier aircraft publication FCOM1, and AFM Supplements. (CNS/ATM)  capabilities  are 5.25.2.  E-11A crews are not authorized to fly Required Navigational Performance (RNP) 0.3 approaches. 5.25.3.  Overlay  approaches.  The  GPS  Approach  Overlay  Program  is  an  authorization  for pilots  to  use  GPS  avionics  under  Instrument  Flight  Rules  (IFR)  for  flying  designated  non-precision  instrument  approach  procedures,  except  LOC,  LDA  and  Simplified  Directional Facility (SDF) procedures. These procedures are now identified by the name of the procedure and  “or  GPS”  (e.g.,  VOR/DME  or  GPS  RWY  15).  Other  previous  types  of  overlays  have 18 AFI11-2E-11V3  12 SEPTEMBER 2017 either  been  converted  to  this  format  or  replaced  with  stand-alone  procedures.  Only approaches contained in the current onboard navigation database are authorized. 5.25.4.  Reduced  Vertical  Separation  Minimums  (RVSM)  Certification.  E-11A  aircraft  and aircrews  are  certified  to  fly  in  RVSM  airspace.    Notify  Air  Traffic  Control  (ATC) immediately if any RVSM-required equipment fails while operating in RVSM airspace.  (T-0). 5.26.  Inflight  Troubleshooting.  After  flight  manual  emergency  procedures  are  complete, aircrews will not conduct in-flight troubleshooting. 5.26.1.  Cockpit  Voice  Recorder  (CVR)  and  Flight  Data  Recorder  (FDR).  If  involved  in  a mishap or incident ensure the following: after landing and terminating the emergency, open the EMS/CDU circuit breakers. 5.27.  Prior  to  Descent  or  Approach.  Pilots  shall  not  begin  an  enroute  descent,  arrival  or published approach if the destination’s weather is below visual only requirements. 5.27.1.  The  PIC  has  final  responsibility  for  determining  when  the  destination  is  below designated minimums and for initiating proper clearance requests. 5.28.  Descent  below  Decision  Height  (DH)/Decision  Altitude  (DA)/  Minimum  Descent Altitude  (MDA)  Using  Enhanced  Vision  System  (EVS).  Continuing  an  approach  below DH/DA/MDA  is  not  authorized  until  sufficient  visual  reference  with  the  runway  environment has  been  established  and  the  aircraft  is  in  a  position  to  execute  a  safe  landing.    Pilots  will  not continue below DH/DA/MDA using EVS as the sole means to identify the runway environment or touchdown zone.  If used for situational awareness, pilots will set the EVS to “Clear” prior to DH. 5.29.  Functional Check Flights. 5.29.1.  The  E-11  Original  Equipment  Manufacturer  (OEM)  engineering  and  manufacturer maintenance  manuals  determine  the  need  for  Functional  Check  Flight  (FCF)  requirements.  E-11A OEM engineering does not require flight checks, therefore, FCFs are not required.  If FCFs  are  required  in  the  future,  an  FCF  Program  must  be  developed  IAW  AFI  21-101 paragraph 8.16. 5.29.2.  If manufacturer maintenance manuals or engineering reviews recommend an inflight check following ground maintenance checks, a flight check specific to the recommendation will be accomplished. 5.29.2.1.  Aircraft will be at least PMC to perform the check on repaired systems.  Flights should  have  a  fuel  load  that  allows  an  immediate  landing.    If  required,  flights  can  be accomplished on operational missions at the discretion of unit leadership. 5.29.2.2.  Minimum  OCF/Mx  Check  Crew  Complement:  At  least  one  Instructor  Pilot (occupying the left seat) and one qualified Pilot (occupying the right seat). AFI11-2E-11V3  12 SEPTEMBER 2017 19 Chapter 6 AIRCREW PROCEDURES 6.1.  General.  This  chapter provided  general  E-11A aircrew procedures that should  be utilized during contingency operations. 6.2.  Preflight  Guidance.  Two  pilots  are  required  to  conduct  engine  start  and  payload initialization.  Single pilot  power-on preflights  are authorized if a second  pilot  is  not  available.  Aircrew  members  performing  preflight  duties  prior  to  a  scheduled  crew’s  arrival  (preflight crews) must be crew rested. 6.2.1.  Aircraft commanders will review and sign the aircraft pre-flight briefing form located in  the  Aircraft  Flight  Log  and  Forms  Binder  onboard  the  aircraft  prior  to  any  crewmember conducting  pre-flight  duties.    Pertinent  items  affecting  the  pre-flight/flight  will  be  briefed before  execution  of  preflight  duties.    Refueling,  de-icing  guides,  and  weight  and  balance sheets  are located in  the back of each maintenance flight  log.  The AC will also  ensure the AFTO Form 46 located at the back of the Aircraft Flight Log and Forms Binder is signed off. 6.2.2.  Crews will verify the following are stored on the aircraft prior to departure: 6.2.2.1.  Fuel Cards and Aircraft Keys Storage. 6.2.2.2.  Unclassified survival gear backpacks. 6.3.  Engine  Runs.  Flight  operations  and  Maintenance  personnel  are  responsible  for  providing Bombardier’s guidance to aircrew to complete required actions.  A crew chief will be positioned outside  the  aircraft  in  contact  with  crew  via  aircraft  interphone  and  have  safety/firefighting equipment readily available.  Exception: a crew chief is not required to be outside during high power  engine  runs.    If  a  maintenance  procedure  is  required  to  be  conducted  in  addition  to  the aircrew checklist, a brief will be conducted between maintenance and the aircrew.  The brief will include at a minimum: 6.3.1.  Plan for engine run. 6.3.2.  Maintenance procedures to be accomplished. 6.3.3.  Potential emergency procedures. 6.3.4.  Egress plan in case the aircraft needs to be evacuated. 6.4.  Cabin Security.  The AC will ensure all items in the cabin are secure prior to taxi.  Curtains will be open for taxi, takeoff and landing. 6.5.  Carriage  of  Mission  Essential  Personnel  (MEP).  If  carrying  non-crewmembers,  pilots will ensure personnel and jump seat pilots are briefed on emergency egress IAW the Bombardier Cabin Safety Card located in the publication locker.  Personnel will remain seated until passing 10,000 feet Above Ground Level (AGL). 6.5.1.  Use  of  the  jump  seat  is  at  the  discretion  of  the  AC.    If  used,  the  jump  seat  will  be stowed until after the engines are started to maintain a clear path for the crew to  egress the aircraft.  The jump seat will then be deployed and the occupant strapped in prior to taxi.  Do not let unfamiliar personnel deploy or stow the jump seat. 20 AFI11-2E-11V3  12 SEPTEMBER 2017 6.6.  Egress Procedures.  Initiate egress IAW the Emergency Ground Evacuation memory item.  The primary means of egress is the passenger door.  Once off the aircraft, the standard rally point is 300 feet off the nose of the aircraft unless otherwise briefed. 6.7.  TOLD and FMS Waypoint Verification.  The CP will load aircraft takeoff parameters and verify with  the AC.  Pilots  will consult  the QRH and SDP  information to  ensure the aircraft is legal to depart.  In addition, both pilots will independently confirm the FMS routing, waypoints and takeoff data prior to departure. AFI11-2E-11V3  12 SEPTEMBER 2017 21 Chapter 7 AIRCRAFT SECURITY 7.1.  General.  This  chapter provides  guidance  for aircraft security  on the ground  and in-flight.  This  security  priority  designation  applies  to  operational  aircraft,  wherever  they  are  located, worldwide.  Some aircraft contain equipment and documents that require protection per AFI 16-1404, Information Security Program Management. 7.2.  Procedures.  The  PIC  is  ultimately  responsible  for  the  security  of  their  aircraft  when located  away  from  US  military  installations.    Air  Force  Instruction  (AFI)  31-101,  Integrated Defense (FOUO), covers security arrangements when US Air Force aircraft are located on other DoD installations.  Arrangements must be made to protect the aircraft during crew rest status at non-US  protected  locations.    If  US  military  security  forces  are  not  available,  the  US  embassy assigned  to  that  country  must  be  consulted  to  ensure  security  arrangements  are  made.    For missions  involving  a  planning  agency,  the  agency  must  coordinate  with  the  PIC  to  ensure  that planned  security  measures  conform  to  mission  requirements.    The  amount  of  security  required may vary, depending on location and ground time. 7.2.1.  For  permissive  environments,  PIC  will  receive  a  threat  assessment  and  force protection  capability  evaluation  briefing  at  home  station  prior  to  departure  and  receive updates enroute, if required.  When landing at a DoD component installation, the installation commander  is  responsible  to  provide  adequate  security  for  the  aircraft.    The  PIC  will determine if security is  adequate.  Planning agencies and PIC will assess the risk to  parked aircraft  for  planned  overnight  stops  located  at  non-US  military  installation  overseas  and civilian  airfields.    For  unscheduled  or  emergency  landings  at  non-USAF  installations,  PIC will  assess  the  aircraft  security  situation  and  take  the  following  actions,  if  force  protection capability appears insufficient: 7.2.1.1.  Aircrew  surveillance.    If  the  aircraft  is  not  remaining  overnight,  aircrews  are capable  of  maintaining  appropriate  aircraft  security.    The  PIC  will  direct  armed  crew members  to  remain  with  the  aircraft  and  maintain  surveillance  of  aircraft  entrances  and activities in the aircraft vicinity. 7.2.1.2.  Area Patrol.  Request area patrol coverage from local security forces to include back-up  response  forces.    If  local  authorities  request  payment  for  this  service,  use  AF Form 15, USAF Invoice. 7.2.1.3.  Departure  without  crew  rest.    If  local  security  forces  are  unacceptable  or unavailable,  the  PIC  may  waive  FDP  restrictions  and  depart  as  soon  as  possible  for  a destination with adequate force protection.  If unable to depart the location due to system malfunction, the aircrew must secure the aircraft to  the best  of their  ability.   In no case will  the  entire  crew  leave  the  aircraft  unattended.    Crew  rest  requirements  will  be subordinate to aircraft security when the airframe may be at risk.  The PIC should rotate a security detail among the crew to provide for both aircraft protection and crew rest until relief  is  available.    The  PIC  will  coordinate  through  C2  channels  to  acquire  additional security. 22 AFI11-2E-11V3  12 SEPTEMBER 2017 Chapter 8 OPERATIONAL REPORTS AND FORMS 8.1.  General.  This  chapter  contains  a  description  of  applicable  reports  and  forms.    For assistance in completing safety forms contact the wing/group, unit, or local safety officer. 8.2.  AF  Form  457,  USAF  Hazard  Report.  Refer  to  AFI  91-202,    The  USAF  Mishap Prevention  Program.    The  USAF  hazard  reporting  system  provides  a  means  for  Air  Force personnel  to  alert  supervisors  and  commanders  to  hazardous  conditions  requiring  prompt corrective  action.    A  hazard  is  any  condition,  act,  or  circumstance  that  jeopardizes  or  may jeopardize  the  health  and  wellbeing  of  personnel,  or  which  may  result  in  loss,  damage,  or destruction of any weapons system, equipment, or material resource. 8.3.  AF  Form  651,  Hazardous  Air  Traffic  Report.  Refer to  AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program., Attachment 3. 8.3.1.  The Air  Force Hazardous Air Traffic Report (HATR) program  provides a means  for personnel  to  report  all  near  midair  collisions  and  alleged  hazardous  air  traffic  conditions.  Use information in HATR reports only for mishap prevention. 8.3.2.  Procedures. 8.3.2.1.  Make an airborne report of the hazardous condition to the nearest ATC agency (e.g.  center,  Flight  Service  Station  (FSS),  control  tower,  or  aeronautical  radio  station), and give the following information as appropriate: 8.3.2.1.1.  Identification or call sign. 8.3.2.1.2.  Time and place (radial/DME, position relative to the airfield, etc.) 8.3.2.1.3.  Altitude or flight level. 8.3.2.1.4.  Description of the other aircraft or vehicle. 8.3.2.1.5.  Include  a  verbal  statement  as  soon  as  possible  after  occurrence  that  a written  HATR  report  will  be  filed  upon  landing.    Note:    ATC  agencies  (e.g.  FAA, etc.) must know if an official report is filed. 8.3.2.2.  File the HATR as soon as possible (within 24 hours) using any available means of  communication.    Normally,  it  should  be  filed  at  the  base  operations  office  at  the landing  airport.    If  this  is  impractical  and  if  communications  permit,  notify  the  safety office of the Air Force base where the condition occurred, the safety office at the home station, or as prescribed by the overseas MAJCOM.  In any case, provide the safety office with  all  available  information  needed  to  prepare  AF  Form  651,  Hazardous  Air  Traffic Report.    Turn  in  a  completed  copy  of  AF  Form  651  to  the  wing/group  safety  office.  Note:    HATR  reports  are  not  privileged  information  and  may  be  released  outside  the USAF. 8.3.3.  Individuals  submitting  a  HATR  are  granted  immunity  from  disciplinary  action provided: 8.3.3.1.  Their violation was not deliberate. AFI11-2E-11V3  12 SEPTEMBER 2017 23 8.3.3.2.  They committed no criminal offense. 8.3.3.3.  No mishap occurred. 8.3.3.4.  They properly reported the incident using the above procedures. 8.4.  AF  Form 711B,  USAF Aircraft Mishap Report Worksheet.  Refer to AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports. 24 AFI11-2E-11V3  12 SEPTEMBER 2017 Chapter 9 FLYING TRAINING 9.1.  General.  This  chapter  outlines  requirements  and  restrictions  for  training  and  evaluation missions  during  contingency  operations.    This  chapter  will  require  a  thorough  review  and revision in the event the E-11A becomes a formal program of record.  Refer to AFI 11-202V1, Aircrew  Training,  AFI  11-202V2,  Aircrew  Standardization/Evaluation  Program,  AFI  11-2E-11V1,  E-11  Aircrew  Training,  and  AFI  11-2E-11V2,  E-11  Aircrew  Evaluation  Criteria  for additional information. 9.2.  Instructor/Flight Examiner Briefings.  Before all training/evaluation missions, the PIC or instructor/flight examiner will brief the crew on the training/evaluation requirements, objectives, planned profiles and seat assignments. 9.3.  Debriefing.  Review and assess overall training performed.  Each student or crew member should thoroughly understand what training has been accomplished.  All required documentation should be completed as expeditiously as possible. 9.4.  Touch-and-go Landing and Missed Approach Limitations.  Touch-and-go landings and practice missed approach procedures are prohibited. 9.5.  Training  on  Operational  Missions.  Unit  commanders  may  approve  training  during operational  missions  provided  an  IP  or  EP  is  occupying  one  of  the  pilot  seats  and  the  training objective is IAW unit syllabus.  Training conducted in support of a possible future operation will be considered mission rehearsal and may be approved by the unit commander on a case by case basis. 9.6.  Simulated  Emergency  Flight  Procedures.  Unless conducted IAW unit training syllabus, simulated emergency procedures are prohibited. 9.6.1.  In the event of an actual emergency, all training will be terminated. AFI11-2E-11V3  12 SEPTEMBER 2017 25 Chapter 10 LOCAL OPERATING PROCEDURES 10.1.  General.  Units  will  publish  local  and/or  unit  operations  procedures  as  a  supplement  to this chapter commencing with paragraph 10.2.  The title will indicate the unit concerned (e.g. “ 10.2. 430 EECS Local Operating Procedures.”). 10.1.1.  Procedures in this chapter will not duplicate, alter, amend or be less restrictive than those in this instruction. 10.1.2.  After validation, send final copies to HQ ACC/A3CA and ACC/A3TV. 26 AFI11-2E-11V3  12 SEPTEMBER 2017 Chapter 11 NAVIGATION PROCEDURES 11.1.  Navigation Charts. 11.1.1.  Annotate  an  appropriately  scaled  navigational  chart  with  the  route  of  flight  and  the following. (T-3): 11.1.2.  Special  Use  Airspace  (SUA)  within  the  altitude  structure  and  within  50  NM  of  the route of flight/orbit airspace per the AFPAM 11-216, Air Navigation. 11.1.3.  Mission airspace/orbit airspace with altitudes, MOA coordinates, Orbit Name, Orbit Shape, and Orbit Coordinates.  A list of commonly used orbits may be created.  Should a new orbit be required, an orbit depiction/requirements sheet will be printed. 11.1.4.  Divert airfields with planning assumptions and transit requirements. 11.1.5.  Annotate an Operational Navigational Chart (ONC), or larger scale, with the planned departure/arrival airfield and the following: 11.1.6.  Planned departure/arrival procedure. 11.1.7.  Special Departure Procedure (SDP). 11.1.8.  Highest terrain or obstacle along expected route of flight. 11.1.9.  Highest  terrain  or  obstacle  within  30  NM.    Note:  Units  will,  if  necessary,  specify flight  plan  requirements  and  procedures  in  their  local  chapters  to  meet  specialized  mission requirements. 11.1.10.  Electronic Flight Bag (EFB). EFBs will be optimized in-flight as a replacement for FLIP.  Squadrons will develop an EFB program IAW MAJCOM guidance. 11.2.  Portable  Electronic  Devices  for  Navigation.  IAW  AFI  11-202V3,  aircrews  are authorized  to  carry  approved  GPS  enabled  devices  for  additional  situational  awareness  if approved by lead/user MAJCOM. AFI11-2E-11V3  12 SEPTEMBER 2017 27 Chapter 12 FUEL PLANNING 12.1.  General.  A  fuel  plan  is  required  for  all  flight  except  AOR  flights  with  established standard  fuel  loads.    All  preflight  planning  must  be  verified  with  the  aircraft  FMS  prior  to departure.  Missions should be planned at altitudes, routes and airspeeds to minimize fuel usage and maximize mission effectiveness. 12.2.  Fuel Planning Profiles.  Enroute cruise airspeed normally should be planned at a constant IAS/Mach  IAW  the  performance  manual.    Divert  profiles  should  be  fully  fuel  planned  and represent what will actually be flown in a divert situation. 12.3.  Fuel Planning Procedures.  Aircrew and mission planners will manage aviation fuel as a limited commodity and  precious  resource.  Fuel  optimization will be considered throughout  all phases  of  mission  planning  and  execution.  (T-3).    Excessive  ramp  and  recovery  fuel  adds  to aircraft gross weight, increases fuel consumption, and reduces performance.  Do not ferry extra fuel beyond optimum requirements for safe mission accomplishment and training objectives. (T-3).  Aircrew and mission planners will optimize flight plans and flight routing for fuel efficiency.  In-flight procedures such as climb/descent profiles and power settings should also be considered for  efficient  fuel  usage.    Aircrew  should  employ  the  following  aviation  fuel  optimization measures without compromising flight safety or jeopardizing mission/training accomplishment: 12.3.1.  Optimize fuel  loads. Mission  plan for the required ramp  and recovery  fuel.   Ensure ramp fuel is correct upon arrival at aircraft. 12.3.2.  Delay engine start time. Establish and implement local engine start time standards. 12.3.3.  Establish  Command  and  Control  (C2)  and  flight  following  procedures  to  ensure timely  notification  of  mission  changes/cancellations  to  avoid  unnecessary  or  unproductive flight time. 12.3.4.  During contingency operations, crews will select a suitable alternate and apply a fuel reserve IAW 11-202V3. 12.3.5.  Crews  will  declare  “emergency  fuel”  and  request  priority  handling  by  ATC  when fuel state is anticipated to be 2,100 lbs (2,400 lbs for aircraft 11-9001) or less at landing.  ROWAYNE A.
