Purpose.  This CFETP provides the information necessary for Air Force Career Field Manager (AFCFM), MAJCOM functional managers (MFMs), commanders, training managers, supervisors, and trainers to plan, develop, manage, and conduct an effective career field training program.  This plan outlines the training that individuals in AFSC 2A6X3 should receive in order to develop and progress throughout their career.  This CFETP identifies initial skill, upgrade, qualification, advanced, and proficiency training.  Initial skills training is the AFS specific training an individual receives upon entry into the Air Force or upon retraining into this specialty for award of the 3-skill level.  This training is conducted by AETC at Sheppard AFB, TX.  Upgrade training identifies the mandatory courses, task qualification requirements, and correspondence course completion requirements for award of the 5-, 7- and, 9-skill levels.  Qualification training is actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an airman in a specific duty position.  This training program occurs both during and after the upgrade training process.  It is designed to provide the performance skills/knowledge required to do the job.  Advanced training is formal specialty training that provides individuals who are qualified in one or more positions of their Air Force Specialty (AFS) with additional skills/knowledge to enhance their expertise in the career field.  Supplemental training is either in-residence or exportable advanced training courses, or on-the-job training.  Proficiency training is additional training, either in-residence or exportable advanced training courses, or on-the-job training, provided to personnel to increase their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required for upgrade.  The CFETP has several purposes, some are:  1.1.  Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field training program.  Also, it is used to help supervisors identify training at the appropriate point in an individual’s career.  1.2.  Identifies tasks and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in the specialty and recommends education/training throughout each phase of an individual's career.  1.3.  Lists training courses that are available in the specialty and identifies sources of training, and the training delivery method.  1.4.  Identifies major resource constraints which impact full implementation of the desired career field training process.  2.  Use of the CFETP.  This plan will be used by MFMs and supervisors at all levels to ensure comprehensive and cohesive training programs are available for each individual in the specialty.    2.1.  AETC training personnel will develop or revise formal resident, non-resident, Training Detachment (TD), and exportable training based upon requirements established by the users and documented in Part II of the CFETP.  They will also work with the AFCFM to develop acquisition strategies for obtaining the resources needed to provide the identified training.  2.2.  MFMs will ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial, upgrade, and proficiency requirements.  OJT, resident training, contract training, or exportable 6 CFETP 2A6X3, 1 April 2014 courses can satisfy these identified requirements.  MAJCOM developed training, to support this AFS, must be identified for inclusion in this plan and must not duplicate other available training resources.  2.3.  Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan.  The list of courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training.  3.  Coordination and Approval.  The AFCFM is the approval authority.  The AETC training manager for AFSC 2A6X3 will initiate an annual review of this document by AETC and MFM to ensure currency and accuracy.  The using MAJCOM representatives and AETC training personnel will identify and coordinate on the career field training requirements.  Using the list of courses in Part II, they will eliminate duplicate training.  Section B - Career Field Progression and Information  4.  Specialty Description.  4.1.  Specialty Summary.

A 9-level can be expected to fill positions such as flight chief, production superintendent, and various staff NCOIC jobs.  Additional training in the areas of budget, manpower, resources, and personnel management should be pursued through continuing education.  Additional higher education and completion of courses outside their career AFSC are also recommended.  6.  Training Decisions.  The CFETP uses a building block approach (simple to complex) to encompass the entire spectrum of training requirements for the Aircrew Egress Systems career field.  The spectrum includes a strategy for when, where, and how to meet these training requirements.  The strategy must ensure we develop affordable training, eliminate duplication, and prevent a fragmented approach to training.  The following training decisions were based on a career field utilization and training workshop at Sheppard Air Force Base, Texas 8 - 10 July 2013.  6.1.  Initial Skills.  Minor changes (additions/deletions) were made to line items affecting the 3-level course.  Changes included addition of use of Maintenance Resource Management, CAD/PAD inspections, use Tool Accountability System, Aircraft Safe for Maintenance, remove, inspect and install emergency oxygen bottle of the ACESII seat, A-10 egress and canopy theory of system operation, as well as B-52 egress theory of system operation and ejection seat theory of operation.  Deletions included Use of automated AFTO Form 781, prepare material deficiency reports, process/control DIFM material, use/inspect/maintain aircraft seat maintenance stand, perform SBSS inquiries, order components w/SBSS, use escape system schematics, inspect vernier rocket motor on the ACES II seat, rotate ejection seat, and remove and install canopy, actuator and follow-on maintenance of the F-16 seat and F-22 egress theory of system operation.  The course would remain at 31 days.  6.2  Five-Level Upgrade Training.  Updates were made to the 5-level CDC that will require minor changes.  Numerous training codes were noted and included in the STS, but few will affect the current text of the CDC.  Presently the 5-level CDCs consist of 4 volumes.  6.3.  Seven-Level Upgrade Training.  Minor changes (additions/deletions) were made to line items affecting core tasks  7.  Community College of the Air Force (CCAF).

Section E – Transitional Training Guide.  There are no transition training requirements. 17 CFETP 2A6X3, 1 April 2014 PART II  Section A - Course Objective List  1.  Measurement.  Each proficiency coded STS task or knowledge item taught at the technical school is measured through the use of an objective.  An objective is a written instruction for the student so he or she knows what is expected of them to successfully complete training on each task.  Each objective is comprised of a condition, behavior, and standard which states what is expected of the student for each task.  The condition is the setting in which the training takes place (i.e. TOs, type of equipment, etc).  The behavior is the observable portion of the objective (i.e. perform an operational check).  The standard is the level of performance that is measured to ensure the STS proficiency code level is attained.  Each objective uses letter codes(s) to identify how it is measured.  All objectives using the Progress Check (PC) code indicate a progress check is used to measure subject or task knowledge.  Progress checks are also used to measure student accomplishment of performance objectives.  W indicates a comprehensive written test and is used to measure the subject or task knowledge at the end of a block of instruction.  PC/W indicates a subject or task knowledge progress check and a separate measurement of both knowledge and performance elements using a written test.  2.  Standard.  The minimum standard for written examinations is 70%.  Standards for performance objectives are indicated in the objective and are also indicated on the individual progress check checklist.  The checklist is used by the instructor to document each student’s progress on each task.  Instructor assistance may be provided as needed during the progress check, and students may be required to repeat all or part of the behavior until satisfactory performance is attained.  Students must satisfactorily complete all PCs prior to taking the written test.  3.  Proficiency Level.  Review column 4A of the STS to determine the proficiency level of a particular task or knowledge item.  Review the proficiency code key in Part II, Section E of this CFETP for an explanation of the proficiency codes.  Most task performance is taught to the ‘2b’ proficiency level which means the students can do most parts of the task, but need assistance on the hardest parts of the task (partially proficient).  The student can also determine step-by-step procedures for doing the task.  The student can also identify why and when a task must be done and why each step is needed.  4.  Course Objectives.  If you require detailed course descriptions and objectives, please provide a written request to the AETC Training Manager, 361 TRS/TRR, 501 Missile Road, Sheppard AFB, TX  76311-2264 or e-mail UDG_361TRS_TRAININGMANAGERS@us.af.mil. 18 CFETP 2A6X3, 1 April 2014 Section B - Support Material  5.

Purpose.  As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program, and this STS:  15.1.  Is a guide for development of promotion tests used in the Weighted Airman Promotion System (WAPS).  Specialty Knowledge Tests (SKTs) are developed at the USAF Airman Advancement Division by Senior NCOs with extensive practical experience in their career fields.  The tests sample knowledge of STS subject matter areas judged by test development team members as most appropriate for promotion to higher grades.  Questions are based upon study references listed in the Enlisted Promotions References and Requirements Catalog (EPRRC).  Individual responsibilities are in AFI 36-2502, Airman Promotion Program.  WAPS is not applicable to the Air National Guard or Air Force Reserve.  15.2.  Lists in the column 1 (Task, Knowledge, and Technical Reference) the most common tasks, knowledge, and technical references (TR) necessary for airmen to perform duties in the 3-, 5-, and 7-skill level. 21 CFETP 2A6X3, 1 April 2014  15.3.  Identifies in column 2 (Core Tasks) by asterisk (*), specialty-wide training requirements. Tasks identified by */R as core tasks are optional for ANG and AFRC when training capability is not available, but must be accomplished when capability becomes available.  MAJCOM Functional Managers, commanders, and supervisors may designate additional critical tasks as necessary.  Third-party certification of core tasks is no longer an Air Force requirement for this specialty.  However, MAJCOMS, commanders, and workcenter supervisors still retain the option to designate critical tasks requiring third-party certification.  To designate a task as requiring third-party certification, circle the appropriate asterisk in the core task column on the specialty training standard (STS) portion the CFETP in the master task list (MTL) and individual training records.  If the task is not already designated as a core task, place just the circle at the appropriate location in the core task column.  15.3.1.  Core tasks which are not applicable to base assigned aircraft or equipment are not required for upgrade (units are not required to send personnel TDY for core task training)  15.3.2.  For units with more than one mission design series (MDS) (e.g. C-130 & F-16) aircraft, upgrade trainees need only complete core tasks on a single MDS.  MFMs, unit commanders, and/or supervisors may require trainees to complete core task training on additional MDS aircraft, if desired.  If some of these core tasks involve training in another unit on base, trainees must still complete all core tasks relevant to at least one MDS aircraft.  Flightline-assigned personnel must complete backshop core tasks and vice versa.  All units are bound by the requirements in this CFETP and will accommodate core task trainees from other units.  15.4.  Provides certification for OJT.  Column 3 is used to record completion of tasks and knowledge training requirements.  Use Maintenance Information Systems (MIS) to document technician qualifications, if available.  Task certification must show a certification or completed date.  15.5.  Shows formal training and correspondence course requirements.  Column 4 shows the proficiency to be demonstrated on the job by the graduate as result of training on the task/knowledge and the career knowledge provided by the correspondence course   15.6.  Qualitative Requirements.  Attachment 1 contains the proficiency code key used to indicate the level of training and knowledge provided by resident training and career development courses.   15.7.  Job Qualification Standard.  Becomes a job qualification standard (JQS) for on-the-job training when placed in AF Form 623, On-The-Job Training Record, and used according to AFI 36-2201.  For OJT, the tasks in column 1 are trained and qualified to the go/no go level. "Go" means the individual can perform the task without assistance and meets local requirements for accuracy, timeliness, and correct procedures.  When used as a JQS, the following requirements apply:  15.7.1.  Documentation.  Document and certify completion of training IAW AFI 36-2201.
