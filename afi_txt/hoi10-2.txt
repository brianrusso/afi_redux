Normal  (Day-to-Day)  Operations  .    During  normal  operations  and  minor  crises,  the AFSWC fulfills the roles, responsibilities, and functions of the AFCAT.  The AFCAT Director and  Team  Chief  responsibilities  are  delegated  to  the  AFOG  Commander  or  their  designated representative. 3.1.1.  AFCAT  Leadership  Positions  are  scheduled  by  the  AFSWC  and  will  be  prepared monthly and when changes occur. 3.1.2.  AFCAT Functional Desk Scheduling.  HAF 2-Letter POCs build and provide monthly standby  schedules  to  ensure  someone  from  their  directorate  is  on-call  24/7;  prepared  to  be recalled for crisis operations and an actual AFCAT activation. 3.1.2.1.  HAF  2-Letter  POCs  will  continuously  update Appointment Letter, as changes occur, to reflect newly trained members. their  AFCAT  Member 3.1.3.  ADVON  Scheduling.    The  ADVON  team  will  be  scheduled  for  one  week  of  duty, from Monday at 1200 local through the following Monday.  A3OO, AF/A2 and 844 CS will provide  a  roster  of  on-call  personnel  and  their  contact  information  to  the  AFSWC.    Each roster will be provided for the month NLT 5 days prior to the start of the month. 3.2.  Crisis  Action/Contingency  Operations.  In  the  event  of  a  significant  crisis  requiring increased manning, and/or that result in a large military/Air Force response, the AFCAT will be activated and manned by personnel from the HAF.  The AFCAT is task organized and tailored to respond  under  any  specific  crisis,  event,  or  US  military  operation.    The  AFCAT  gathers  and analyzes  information,  provides  SME  inputs,  and  acts  as  the  central  AF  point  of  contact  for  all matters related to the incident for which the AFCAT is responsible. 3.2.1.  AFCAT Activation. 3.2.1.1.  Recall.    When  directed  by  AF/A3,  the  AFSWC  initiates  an  AFCAT  Recall through  the  HAF  2-Letter  POCs  to  the  on-call  AFCAT  member.    The  AFSWC  will contact  each  HAF  2-Letter  POC  as  designated  by  each  HAF  Directorate’s  AFCAT Member Appointment Letter.  If the HAF 2-Letter POC or alternate cannot be contacted, the AFSWC will reach out  to  the 2-Letter Principal’s executive officer or staff to  make contact with someone in the directorate.  HAF Directorates are responsible for having a HAF 2-Letter POC and having a trained AFCAT member on standby 24/7.  HAF 2-Letter POCs  will  make  contact  with  their  standby  person  for  each  applicable  functional  desk they are responsible for and pass all information  relayed by the AFSWC.  Additionally, HAF  2-Letter  POCs  will  report  back  to  the  AFSWC  and  their  Directorate  Leadership when  personnel  are  unable  to  be  reached  or  unable  to  report  and  an  alternate  is  not available. 3.2.1.1.1.  The  AFSWC  will  include  the  report  time  in  the  recall  notification  to  the HAF 2-Letter POCs.  AFCAT members will make every effort to be present for duty at  or  before  the  scheduled  report  time.    When  scheduled  AFCAT  members  are directed  to  report,  they  shall  report  to  the  AFCAT  floor  within  1  hour  during  duty hours and within 2 hours during non-duty hours. 16 HOI 10-2  1 NOVEMBER 2017 3.2.1.2.  Upon  activation,  the  AFCAT  Director  or  Team  Chief  is  the  sole  authority  for release  or  recall  of  individual  AFCAT  members.    Following  the  in-brief,  the  AFCAT Director  or  Team  Chief  will  determine,  based  on  the  current  situation,  the  necessary staffing requirements. 3.2.1.2.1.  Staffing Options: 3.2.1.2.1.1.  Full  AFCAT.    All  AFCAT  Leadership  Positions,  Functional  Desks, and Support Staff are required. 3.2.1.2.1.2.  Tailored  AFCAT.    Required  AFCAT  positions  are  identified  by  the AFCAT Director or Team  Chief with  the remaining positions directed back into standby or virtual presence. 3.2.1.2.1.3.  Standby Presence.  A heightened version of normal operations, where personnel  can  reasonably  be  expected  to  report  to  primary  or  relocation  sites  on short notice. 3.2.1.2.1.4.  Virtual Presence.  Virtual presence can be used for a full AFCAT or tailored  AFCAT.    It  directs  all  required  AFCAT  Members,  as  determined  by Director  or  Team  Chief,  to  be  performing  their  Functional  Desk  or  AFCAT Leadership responsibilities from their normal place of work (e.g. primary office).  They must be linked via a designated communication platform (e.g. Chat, Secure Chat,  Shared Web Platform, Video Conference, etc.).   If recalled to  the AFCAT facility, members will have 15 minutes to report. 3.2.1.3.  AFCAT Director Designation.  AF/A3 will typically assign a General Officer to perform  the  Director  position  at  the  time  of  activation.    The  AFOG  Commander  or designated  representative  will  perform  the  Director  duties  until  the  appointed  General Officer is present. 3.2.1.4.  ADVON Recall.  When directed by AF/A3, the AFSWC executes a recall of the ADVON.  ADVON members will report IAW the HAF COOP Operations Order. 3.2.2.  AFCAT  Site.    The  primary  AFCAT  is  located  at  the  Pentagon,  in  the  Resource  and Situational  Awareness  Center  (RSAC).    The  AFCAT  facility  has  two  parts:    The  AFCAT floor and the Crisis Action Center (CAC).  The AFOG maintains the facility and will have it ready within 1 hour of AFCAT activation. 3.2.2.1.  Upon activation, the entire facility is accessible through a controlled entry point at  the  6th  Corridor,  1st  Floor,  “D”  Ring  Entrance  (1D652).    When  the  AFCAT  is  not activated,  entrance  to  the  AFCAT  must  be  coordinated  with  AFOG  C4  or  AFSWC personnel. 3.2.2.2.  Depending  on  the  nature  of  the  crisis  and  required  military  response,  AFCAT actions  may  range  from  Unclassified  through  Top  Secret/SCI.    The  AFCAT  CAC  is  a Sensitive  Compartmented  Information  Facility  (SCIF).    Therefore,  to  have  unescorted access  to  the  AFCAT,  personnel  must  possess  a  TS/SCI  clearance  and  be  read  into SI/TK/G/HCS.    Personnel  assigned  to  the  AFCAT  who  do  not  meet  these  requirements will be escorted during AFCAT operations. 3.2.2.3.  Electronic devices are not permitted in the AFCAT. HOI 10-2  1 NOVEMBER 2017 17 3.2.2.4.  Relocation Sites.  Predesignated relocation sites are identified in the HAF COOP Operations Order and will be briefed during AFCAT Orientation. 3.2.2.5.  AFCAT  Checklist.    When  assembled,  AFCAT  Leadership  will  refer  to  Figure 3.1 for AFCAT activation actions. Figure 3.1.  AFCAT Activation Checklist Action OPR Direct activation of AFCAT under recommendation of AF/A3OO Determine AFCAT standup time Notify AFCAT Team Chief  (may occur during recall) Confirm AFCAT battle rhythm (may occur after activation) Develop roster of AFCAT members (may occur after activation) Publish Warning Order as required Schedule and build AFCAT Situation Update  (may occur after recall)  AFSWC/A3OB AF/A3 AF/A3OO AF/A3OO AF/A3OO AF/A3OO AFSWC Recall AFCAT Activate crisis space – AFCAT Floor, CAC, telephones and communications equipment, AF Briefing Center Activate AFCAT Develop and publish AFCAT activation message Conduct AFCAT Situation Brief Hold crisis action training (if there is time)  Establish chronological events log  Determine other CAT activations and battle rhythms (JS, Services, CCMD, JTF, JFACC, etc.) Establish task tracker  Establish products tracker  Coordinate admin support and check supplies  Issue parking passes AFSWC/2-Letter POCs AF/A3OO AFSWC AFSWC AFSWC/A3OB AF/A3OO CAT Exec CAT Exec CAT Exec CAT Exec CAT Supt CAT Supt 3.3.  AFCAT Battle Rhythm.  During AFCAT operations, the battle rhythm is flexible and will be altered to meet the requirements of the situation.  Typically, an AFCAT is manned 24-hours a day  by  two  teams,  each  working  a  12-hour  shift,  plus  changeover  time.    Shift  changeovers usually begin at 0530 local and 1730 local and conclude at 0630 local and 1830 local. 3.4.  Briefing Procedures.  AFCAT desks provide individual brief inputs based on their areas of expertise,  which  support  the  Director’s  Update,  with  individual  slides  provided  upon  request.  Brief  inputs  are  produced  twice  daily  and  provided  to  the  Team  Chief.    Normally,  these  desk inputs  cover  significant  events  for  the  last  24  hours,  projected  actions  for  the  next  7  days, summary of results, and additional detailed information related to the crisis. 3.4.1.  Concept.  The daily Director’s Update is normally presented at 0600 and 1800 in the CAC.  AFCAT members provide input to the Briefing Team as directed by the AFCAT battle rhythm.  The Briefing Team then collates the inputs and prepares the brief.  The Team Chief or Director reviews and approves the brief.  Depending upon the audience for the final brief, it may also be reviewed by the AF/A3.  The AFCAT Director provides the battle rhythm for 18 HOI 10-2  1 NOVEMBER 2017 briefings and this timeline may change due to the nature of the crisis supported.  An example of  a  briefing  timeline  is  below  at  Figure  3.2.  The  AFCAT  Briefer  has  the  primary responsibility for briefing and briefing products, however, any member may be called on to brief.  Any member called on to brief should coordinate with the AFCAT Briefer. Figure 3.2.

AFCAT Deactivation.  When directed by the AF/A3, the AFCAT Director or his/her designated representative deactivates the AFCAT.  Through the AFSWC, the AF/A3 sends a deactivation  message  to  all  higher,  adjacent,  and  subordinate  commands  and  interested agencies  advising  them  of  the  AFCAT  deactivation.    The  message  also  provides  specific points of contact for any unresolved issues.  AFCAT Leadership will refer to Figure 3.3 for AFCAT Deactivation Checklist actions. Figure 3.3.
