The AF supports the DoD in facilitating resources and prioritizing capabilities to align equipment, manpower, and support that enables the DoD to make fiscally sound decisions in support of the National Security Strategy (NSS) and the National Defense Strategy (NDS). The DoD Directive (DoDD) 7045.14 establishes and outlines the SPPBE process to develop, validate, approve, and implement fiscally sound decisions by leveraging past decisions and actions to develop and attain a future strategic vision. The AF SPPBE process consists of five distinct, but overlapping phases; Strategy, Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution. The Planning, Programming, and Budgeting phases are comprehensively documented in this playbook to establish a consistent and standardized SPPBE process with clearly defined requirements, work products, and roles and responsibilities. As a critical input into SPPBE, Strategy high-level process and requirements are annotated in this playbook for the user’s edification. The Execution phase is also documented with high-level requirements, definitions, and work products. The SPPBE process is a standard DoD process implemented every cycle in the AF. However, there are a few external factors that may impact the timely delivery of work products and responsibilities in the process. Based on SME feedback, there are four main, high-impact external factors that the AF must react to and mitigate in order to successfully complete the SPPBE process. The four main external factors that may have the greatest impact to the AF SPPBE process are the following:   Presidential election changes the administration and guidance to the AF   Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) decides when Quadrennial Defense Reviews (QDRs) are conducted to analyze strategic objectives and potential military threats   OSD releases separate DoD Chief Information Officer (CIO) Strategic Planning Guidance (SPG) and Defense Planning Guidance (DPG)   OSD releases Program Objective Memorandum (POM) Issue Papers late in the cycle The Presidential Election changes the administration and guidance to the AF, which impacts the SPPBE process by altering SPPBE timelines and strategic guidance that are incorporated into the SPPBE process. To mitigate changes in strategic guidance and rework, the Planning process is delayed until the Presidential State of the Union address in mid-January. This delay compresses the timeline to approximately 2 months. Additionally, miscommunication of the new administration guidance and direction may create confusion in clearly understanding the strategic objectives of the AF. The delay in Planning combined with miscommunication of new administration guidance results in unclear deadlines and objectives for Programming and Budgeting stakeholders.  Version 4.1 7   The OSD decides when QDRs are conducted to analyze strategic objectives and potential military threats, which impacts the SPPBE process by creating irregular and infrequent strategic guidance changes that may affect the Air Force Strategy and the Strategic Master Plan (SMP). Due to the irregular release of QDRs, the AF is limited in planning and allocating dedicated resources to effectively react and align to the new SMP guidance. Additionally, the Strategy, Planning, Programming, and Budgeting processes work proactively ahead of a current cycle to finalize work products for the Execution of current and past cycle funds. Alignment to the new SMP creates rework to the previous SPPBE cycle, current SPPBE cycle, and future SPPBE cycle work products. With limited resources, the AF is forced to prioritize and compress timelines to rework key work products in order to adjudicate per newly published QDR guidance. The OSD releases separately DoD CIO SPG and DPG, which impacts the SPPBE process by potentially releasing contradictory guidance. The SPPBE process creates work products aligned to the first published guidance for the current and future SPPBE cycles. With the release of the secondary guidance, the AF must review the new guidance and re-align work products to the new, secondary guidance. This realignment creates rework and requires additional resources to review and adjudicate the work products to comply with the released guidance. This requires the AF to allocate current resources to rework work products on compressed timelines in order to align work products to both the DoD CIO SPG and DPG. The OSD releases POM Issue Papers late in the cycle, which impacts the SPPBE process by decreasing the available time for stakeholders to review and provide sufficient responses to the Issue Papers and compresses their overall timeline. OSD dictates the AF process to review Issue Papers concurrently, causing the categorization of Issue Papers to Programmatic or Budget Issue Papers. Separate and concurrent reviews of the Issue Papers are conducted in the Programming and Budgeting phases in order to complete the processes prior to be President’s Budget (PB) rollout. Further high-level detail of this concurrent process is in this playbook in Appendix VII. These four external factors are critical to note and maintain stakeholder awareness in completing the AF SPPBE process. The current version of this playbook documents the current sequential process and not the process alternatives or reactions caused by the above external factors.  The SPPBE Current-State Playbook is the first step of an ongoing SPPBE process improvement effort where additional work will be required to further identify, document, and implement process improvements, including efforts to:    Seek efficiencies, reduce duplication of effort, and optimize timelines   Better distinguish the Planning and Programming roles   Ensure Planning retains its strategic/long-term role   Provide meaningful opportunity for strategic participation by Headquarters AF (HAF)   Align AF regulations, delegations, statute, and policy horizontal integrators (Assistant Secretaries and Deputy Chiefs of Staff)   Version 4.1 8   2.0 – SPPBE Process Documentation Approach SPPBE SMEs provided process definitions, activities, business rules, and roles and responsibilities through a series of 1-day workshops and a 5-day rapid improvement event (RIE). The outcomes of these workshops and RIE are illustrated below in Figure 1, and were compiled, documented, and organized by utilizing suppliers, inputs, processes, outputs, and customers (SIPOC) methodology, process maps, process narratives, and roles and responsibilities matrices (Responsible, Accountable, Supportive, Consulted, Informed (RASCI) model) to document the current-state AF SPPBE process. Additional methodology detail for “Documenting the Current Process” and “Defining the Roles and Responsibilities” are located in Sub-sections 2.1 and 2.2 of this playbook. Figure 1 - Key Activities and Outcomes of the SPPBE Effort:  2.1 – Approach – Documenting the Current Process In order to codify the current-state SPPBE process, SMEs identified key activities and impactful information to initiate, transform, and produce outputs. The output of a previous key process activity informs the next key activity in that process flow as a new input of information for development and transformation in that key activity step. The current-state SPPBE sequential process incorporates and aligns Manpower inputs, as well as Strategic Basing inputs into the SPPBE phases. Additionally, the interaction between the SPPBE processes and Manpower processes are identified via applicable work products developed and  Version 4.1 9   passed between the two aligned processes. Supporting process work products are annotated on maps and in narrative in this playbook by inputs, aligned to a SPPBE key activity, and are labeled using SPPBE requirement name and supporting prerequisite requirement name. The SIPOC methodology captures and documents a high-level summation of key process activities and the corresponding linkages between organizations (suppliers, customers), supplied information (inputs), and received information (outputs). The SIPOCs are used to illustrate the information handoffs in each separate phase of the AF SPPBE process and may be referenced in Appendix Section IV.  In order to develop more detail and define the processes, SMEs provided process details to identify and align the roles for completing a particular process activity step. This accompanying narrative provides supporting information, step prerequisites, and the decisional requirements in order to complete the applicable key activity step. The current-state process map documentation codifies the AF SPPBE process flow and outlines the requirements for aligning the roles and responsibilities of key process stakeholders to be accountable for successful completion of a process. The applicable SPPBE process maps are incorporated in Appendix Section V of this playbook. 2.2 – Approach – Defining the Roles and Responsibilities Organizations have equity in the SPPBE process and are responsible for completing process activity steps that create informational pushes and pulls for the next incoming and outgoing key activities of the process. Documentation of these organizations’ process activity steps and their functions are captured by utilizing the RASCI model.  The definition of RASCI is below:   Responsible / OPR: the office who is the doer or builder of the work products   Accountable / Approval: the office to whom "R" is accountable and is the authority who provides oversight on work before it is effective   Supportive: the office who provides resources or plays a supporting role in completion   Consulted / Coordinated: the office who reviews work content and provides feedback and/or expertise necessary to complete the process step   Informed: the office who needs to be notified of results but need not necessarily be of the activity consulted 2.3 – Approach – Using this SPPBE Current-State Playbook This document contains contextual information regarding the AF SPPBE process and includes Manpower interactions. The SPPBE Current-State Playbook contains detailed process definitions that are documented in process maps, narratives, and RASCIs. The accompanying process maps provide a visual representation of the activity steps required to successfully complete each phase of the SPPBE process.  Version 4.1 10     RASCI models codify the process roles and responsibilities   High-level process maps provide an overall visual summation of the major activity steps included in each separate SPPBE phase    SIPOCs provide a different high-level view of key process activity linkages between organizations (suppliers, customers), supplied information (inputs), and received information (outputs) and was used as the starting point to create the detailed process maps   Process maps graphically depict all activity steps and corresponding inputs and outputs associated with each phase of the SPPBE process    Narratives provide descriptions of work performed for each activity step in the process maps and also provides contextual information on how to complete the process  To navigate this playbook; utilize the left hand navigation pane by clicking on the “View” tab in the tool ribbon, and select “Navigation Pane” in the “Show” section. Then, click on the triangles beside each section to view the contents and expand the relevant selection. This allows the reader to navigate to that section, process maps, and individual steps. Hovering over a step in the navigation pane reveals the entire step title. The reader is able to click and drag the right border of the navigation pane to widen. This playbook remains as a living document that can be revised or expanded by SPPBE key stakeholders to support future modifications, as needed. It has been produced in a manner that allows functional areas to extract relevant portions of the SPPBE process for use in their respective areas of responsibility. When adhered to, this playbook ensures standardization and promotes awareness of SPPBE across the AF. 2.4 – Process Change Management SAF/MG is the OPR for evaluating, maintaining, and administering changes to the SPPBE process within this playbook and associated SPPBE policy documents and Air Force Instructions.  AF/A5/8 and SAF/FM are the functional SPPBE policy and process owners. Prior to implementing organizational changes, role changes, responsibility changes, work product changes, and process and process-relevant changes, key stakeholders shall submit process change requests to SAF/MG for review and impact assessment. SAF/MG will coordinate requests across the SPPBE key process stakeholders to ensure changes do not negatively impact efficiency and effectiveness of the overall process. The SPPBE change management process, as illustrated below in Figure 2, defines the process for requesting and approving any additional SPPBE Current-State Playbook changes or updates moving forward, as necessary.    Version 4.1 11   Figure 2 – SPPBE Change Management Process:      Version 4.1 12   3.0 – High-Level SPPBE Phase Handoffs The SPPBE lifecycle involves the following five major phases–Strategy, Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution. The graphic below, Figure 3, illustrates critical exchanges of key deliverables between each of the phases in the SPPBE process. Some phases overlap, which results in participants providing multiple inputs into parallel SPPBE cycles, each representing an activity affecting different fiscal years (FYs). These inputs and outputs between the phases of SPPBE occur concurrently with multiple cycles, however, these inputs and outputs also occur sequentially for a single cycle. The following list aligns key deliverable AF inputs to the respective SPPBE phase:   Strategy Inputs: AF Strategic Environment Assessment (AFSEA), Previous AF Strategy   Planning Inputs: AF Strategy, AF Future Operating Concept (AF FOC), AF SMP, 30-and SMP, and 30-Year Plan: Approved Year Plan Assessment, and SPG   Programming Inputs: POM Preparation Instruction (PPI), Program Guidance Memorandum (PGM), Zero Balance Transfers (ZBTs), Zero Based Reprogrammings (ZBRs), Disconnects / Initiatives / Offsets (D/I/Os), Plan to Program Guidance (PPG): Final, Resource Allocation Plan (RAP): Final, 10-Year Integrated Plan, 30-Year Plan, POM Courses of Action (COAs), POM: Approved, Program Decision Memorandum (PDM) and Program Budget Decision (PBD): Published, Final Appropriations and Authorizations, Execution Data, Omnibus, and Reprogramming Workbook   Budgeting Inputs:  POM: Approved, Budget Estimate Submission (BES), Justification Book (J-Book): Exhibit Automation System (EAS) Data, J-Book: Integrated Budget Documentation  and Execution System (IDECS) Data, PDM: Final, Execution Data, Omnibus, and Reprogramming Workbook   Execution Inputs:  J-Book, PB: Published, and Backcasting Options     Version 4.1 13   Figure 3 – Handoffs and Feedback Loops throughout the Phases of the SPPBE Process: 3.1 – High-Level SPPBE Process Summary  The SPPBE current-state process, as illustrated in Figure 4, includes phases as a framework to determine future capabilities and provide opportunities to re-examine prior decisions in light of evolving threats, economic conditions, and security concerns.  The phases of the SPPBE process are defined as follows:    Strategy articulates strategic guidance and establishes priority areas for investment, institutional change, and developing operational concepts to build an Air Force capable of overcoming future challenges   Planning translates strategic guidance into an integrated, balanced, and prioritized AF Plan to guide Capability Development (CD), Programming, Budgeting, and shape Leadership strategic communications   Programming allocates Future Year Defense Program (FYDP) resources guided by the AF Plan, Congress, OSD, Fiscal Guidance, and Fact-of-Life changes; reinforces the AF strategic message   Budgeting updates POM pricing, applies Fact-of-Life changes and economic assumptions, incorporates Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and OSD directed changes, codifies justification, and defends the budget to Congress by echoing the AF strategic message   Execution expends the resources provided by Congress to achieve the AF Strategy  Version 4.1 14   Figure 4 – Forward Phase Interactions of the SPPBE Process: The SPPBE process utilizes previous cycle work products as a baseline in creating current cycle work products. The high-level connection of previous cycle to the current cycle is illustrated below in Figure 5. Figure 5 – Previous Phase Interactions of the SPPBE Process:      Version 4.1 15   4.0 – SPPBE Phase 0 – Strategy 4.1 – Strategy Process Summary The AF Strategy development establishes strategic priorities to achieve AF goals and define capabilities. In accordance with (IAW) DoDD 7045.14, the AF strategic plan effectively postures defense resources to align with and support the U.S. national security and foreign policy objectives. Strategy development begins with the Chief of Staff (CSAF) vision and ends with implementation and assessment of the AF SMP. The AF Strategy will evolve over time, requiring the resource allocation process to be equally flexible to strategic changes. During the AF Strategy phase, AF/A5S creates the AFSEA, AF FOC, AF Strategy, and the AF SMP in order to initiate the Planning phase. 4.2 – Strategy Process Map Summary The Strategy process is outlined in the below figure and provides a high-level summary of the process in the following section based on SME discussions and inputs.

The Strategy phase concludes with the implementation and assessment of the AF SMP. Successfully implementing SMP objectives that require significant resourcing involves close integration of the AF Strategy and SMP into the Planning phase. As such, AF/A5S provides near and mid-term strategic inputs at the beginning of the Planning cycle.  Activity Performer: AF/A5S Description: AF/A5S creates the current cycle AFSEA based on AF leadership guidance and is leveraged to create Planning guidance. The AFSEA is updated every 4 years and provides a concise, common baseline for AF strategic planning regarding the anticipated future strategic environment and the associated implications from an Airman’s perspective for delivering Global Vigilance, Global Reach, and Global Power through air, space, and cyberspace over the next 20 years. AF/A5S develops the AFSEA by: (1) compiling global trends based on research of existing projections from multiple authoritative sources; (2) determining which global trends are most relevant to the future AF operating environment over the next 30 years; (3) considering plausible alternative futures based on these key trends for the USAF to identify common features between them relevant to USAF strategic planning; and (4) determining implications relevant to AF strategic planning while avoiding solutions. AF/A5S collaborates with the HAF Strategy offices during the development of the AFSEA.

AF/A5S leverages the previous cycle AF Strategy to develop the current cycle AF FOC, which is then incorporated into the current cycle AF Strategy. This overarching force development concept is not a directive, but provides context and direction for the AF Strategy, AF SMP, and subsequent wargaming and concept development. The AF FOC is reviewed every 2 years and is updated when there are changes in the AFSEA. The AF FOC is leveraged during the development of Planning guidance in the Planning phase. AF/A5S collaborates with the HAF Strategy offices during the development of the AF FOC.

AF/A5S uses DoD strategic documents, as well as AF leadership guidance in order to develop the current cycle AF Strategy. The AF Strategy is informed by the AFSEA, as well as the NSS, NDS, National Military Strategy (NMS), and interim guidance provided by the President or the Secretary of Defense (SECDEF). The AF Strategy is updated every 4 years or as needed to respond to changes in AFSEA-derived implications or updated SecAF and CSAF guidance. AF/A5S collaborates with the HAF Strategy offices during the development of the AF Strategy. AF/A5S uses the AF Strategy to inform the current cycle AF SMP.

The AF SMP operationalizes the AF Strategy on a 20-year timeline by translating AF strategic objectives into authoritative planning direction, aligning activities across the AF, and providing a mechanism to track progress in achieving the AF Strategy. During the development of the AF SMP, AF/A5S conducts various strategic assessments of the following items: AF Strategy, previous AF SMP, POM, final appropriations/authorizations, as well as the previous cycle RAP. AF/A5S collaborates with the HAF and MAJCOM Strategy offices during the development of the AF SMP.  The AF SMP contains additional contextual information in the AF SMP Annexes, which include: the Human Capital Annex, Strategic Posture Annex, Capabilities Annex, and the Science and Technology Annex. Each annex focuses on a foundational element of the AF Strategy and translates the comprehensive goals and objectives outlined within the AF SMP into tangible actions and priorities. Both the AF SMP and its associated annexes are comprehensively updated every 2 years based on assessing progress toward goals and objectives and SecAF and CSAF strategic guidance. Furthermore, the AF SMP and its associated annexes are leveraged to create Planning guidance during the Planning phase.  Business Rule(s):  Utilize wargaming insights, wargaming recommendations, and strategic implementation assessments in support of developing AF SMP.

In collaboration with key stakeholders across the HAF, Core Function Leads (CFLs), and the Air Reserve Component (ARC), AF/A8XP assesses and incorporates an analysis of AF capability, capacity, and readiness in relation to existing conditions, projected threats, and Joint Force requirements. A key outcome of the Planning phase is an executable, credible, and transparent AF plan that contains additional context regarding options for concepts, capabilities, and policies that delivers the force in a resource-constrained plan. The Planning guidance establishes a series of strategic vectors that creates a capable future force, and directs future capability development efforts aligned to those critical AF strategic vectors. The Planning phase also translates long-range AF strategy and shapes senior leadership’s strategic communications for the overall AF SPPBE process. Planning guidance is a starting point for CFLs, and HAF Planners, including HAF Panel representatives, to develop the Core Function Support Plan (CFSP) and the SPG for directed products, which enables a balanced allocation of resources across a 30-Year Plan that enhances Global Vigilance, Global Reach, and Global Power across the range of military operations. The Planning phase produces the 30-Year Plan, the 10-Year Integrated Plan, and the PPG all of which are updated each Planning cycle to accurately reflect any additional impactful modifications throughout the course of this phase. In addition, the Planning phase produces detailed guidance in regards to strategic capability and resource decision-making throughout the SPPBE process in its entirety. The 30-Year Plan gradually builds towards an affordable topline position to succeed across the core mission areas, and establishes the necessary foundational capabilities for the AF. The 10-Year Integrated Plan serves as a vector that realigns the AF Planning Choices towards the 30-Year Plan and also provides achievable targets for the duration of two sequential FYDPs. 5.2 – Planning Process Map Summary The high-level Planning phase process is outlined below in Figure 7 and summarizes the detailed Planning process, as well as roles and responsibilities, which can also be found in the Appendix Section V for more information. The detailed Planning phase process maps provide in-depth contextual information that contains the specific process performer(s) (swim lanes), activities, inputs, and outputs. The RASCI model documents the detailed roles and responsibilities of all stakeholders that are involved with the completion of each activity step that occurs in this phase.

Programming begins with the delivery of the RAP, the PPG, and OSD Fiscal Guidance. Programming guidance for the development of the POM is provided in the PPI and PGM. The programming process operates within the governance of the AFCS and adheres to the guidance and priorities within the DPG, AF SMP, RAP, PPG, Congressional directions and law, and Fact-of-Life changes. The process is extremely dynamic and interactive. It develops, assesses and prioritizes tradeoff options including alternative force structures, weapon system programs, and support systems. The phase ends with the delivery of a POM constructed within a balanced topline which supports Air Force Readiness, Capability, and Capacity directives for the FYDP. The POM covers the 5-year FYDP, which is presented to the Services and Defense Agencies on how the AF proposes to balance their available resources through an analysis of missions, objectives, alternative methods to accomplish objectives, and allocation of resources. Each DoD Service submits a final POM and BES IAW direction from the OSD in order to obtain approval of the AF position. The AF position identifies future requirements for the allocation of resources in preparation to translate them into budget proposals in the Budgeting Phase of the SPPBE process. 6.2 – Programming Process Map Summary The high-level Programming phase process is outlined in Figure 8 and a summary of the process detail and roles and responsibilities is in the Appendix Section V. The process detail contains the detailed Programming process maps indicating the process performer(s) (swim lanes), activities, inputs, and outputs. The RASCI model documents the detailed roles and responsibilities of process steps. The following is a list of Programming maps detailed in Appendix Section V:    2.0 – Programming    2.02 – Extend Baseline   2.02.03 – Conduct Round Zero   2.02.05 – Select and Apply Inflation/Escalation Factors   2.24 – Program Defense   2.25 – Offsets  In addition, a SIPOC model is in Appendix Section IV. The SIPOC provides a different view of the Programming phase and key process activity linkages between organizations (suppliers, customers), supplied information (inputs), and received information (outputs) and was used as the starting point to create the detailed process maps.

The BES is developed and submitted to OSD Comptroller based on the POM, as modified by programmatic updates and fact-of-life changes. OSD Comptroller conducts a Budget Review to evaluate the BES, ensuring programs are correctly costed and dollars are budgeted in fiscal management rules. During the review, OSD Comptroller directs changes to the Services’ budgets by issuing PBD. The PBD are incorporated into a PB and presented to OSD and Congress. The budget is defended until enacted by Congress, beginning the Budget Execution Phase. 7.2 – Budgeting Process Map Summary The high-level Budgeting phase process is outlined in Figure 9 and a summary of the process detail and roles and responsibilities is in the Appendix Section V. The process detail contains the detailed Budgeting process maps indicating the process performer(s) (swim lanes), activities, inputs, and outputs. The RASCI model documents the detailed roles and responsibilities of process steps.  The following is a list of Budgeting maps detailed in Appendix Section V:    3.00 – Balancing BES   3.07 – Develop New/Adjust Offsets (Not Balance to TOA and Under Threshold)   3.19 – Review and Defend the BES and Deliver the PB  In addition, a SIPOC model is in Appendix Section IV. The SIPOC provides a different view of the Budgeting phase and key process activity linkages between organizations (suppliers, customers), supplied information (inputs), and received information (outputs) and was used as the starting point to create the detailed process maps.

Terms of Reference Activity Step Performer: Organization or individuals responsible for the successful completion of a process step. AFCS Board: The Board provides flag-level (1-2 Star and civilian equivalent) review, evaluation, and recommendations in the same broad categories as the Council. Members are selected by their Council counterpart and are responsible for preparing their principal for Council meetings. Additional members of the Board are advisory and represent programs with AF TOA and a combination of unique functional expertise. Additionally, panel chairs and AF CONOPS Champions are present, each representing mission and functional areas of AF expertise. Additionally, the Board directs the focus of the Group in resolving issues, refines Group developed recommendations for submission to the Council, and expedites Directorate-level coordination on significant issues. The Board is chaired by Director of Programs, HQ USAF/A8P, with the Associate Director as his back up, and co-chaired by Deputy Assistant Secretary (Financial Management) (SAF/FMB), on non-budget issues. During budget formulation and execution, and during the Budget Review cycle, it is chaired by SAF/FMB. AFCS Board Key Stakeholders:   HQ USAF: A1, A2, A3/5, A4/7, A8, A9, HC, JA, RE, SG, TE   SAF: AA, AG, AQ, FM, GC, IA, IE, IG, LL, PA, CIO A6, USA, ANG   Advisory members include: AF/A1M, AF/A7C, AF/A8X AFCS Council: The Council is the senior forum for cross-functional consideration of the most critical AF issues. The Council reviews and evaluates AF objectives, policies, plans, programs, budgets, and studies to make timely recommendations to the SECAF and CSAF. The Council also provides expeditious Deputy Chiefs of Staff (DCS)-level coordination on significant, urgent, and complex issues to ensure that AF plans, polices, and programs comply with Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), OSD, and national objectives. The Council returns issues to the AF Board for further study. The Council is chaired by the VCSAF, and membership consists of Air Staff and Secretariat Principals (3-Star and civilian equivalent with some selected 2-Star members). AFCS Council Key Stakeholders:   HQ USAF: CVA, A1, A2, A3/5, A4/7, A8, A9, HC, JA, RE, SE, SG, ST, TE   SAF: AA, AQ, CM, FM, GC, IA, IE, IG, LL, MR, SB, CIO A6, US(D), NGB   Advisory members include: AF/A8P, AF/CCC, AF/CVE, AF/CVAS, AF/CVAE, AF/CX, SAF/AG, SAF/FMB AFCS Group: The Group provides the Board and senior-level leadership (O-6 and civilian equivalents) a forum for initial corporate review and evaluation on appropriate issues in the same broad categories as both the Board and Council. The Group is the first level of the AFCS that integrates the AF mission, mission support areas, and capabilities into a balanced AF program. Members are selected by their Board counterpart or 2-letter sponsors and are responsible for  Version 4.1 125   preparing their principal for Board or Council meetings. Its ultimate strength lies in its broad representative span that allows thorough vetting of issues before being elevated to the Board or Council for review and deliberation. Like the Board and Council, the Group provides a forum for expeditious Division-level coordination on significant issues. AFCS Group Key Stakeholders:   HQ USAF: A1, A1M, A1S, A1X, A2, A3/5, A3O, A3S, A4P, A7C, A7S, A8F, A8P, A8X, A9R, HC, JA, RE, SG, TE   SAF: AA, AG, AQ, FM, FMC, GC, IA, IE, IG, LL, PA, USA, ANG, CIO A6 AF Strategic Environment Assessment (AFSEA): As the foundation of Strategy, Planning, and Programming, the AFSEA informs all follow-on AF planning and programming. The AFSEA describes domestic and international trends in the future strategic environment, and the implications of those trends for air, space, and cyberspace operations over the next 20 years. The AFSEA presents an Airman’s perspective on future constraints, threats, and opportunities, and promotes consistency throughout the AF Strategic Planning System (AFSPS) and the broader planning activities across the AF. AFSEA development integrates multiple external and internal sources to ensure a comprehensive assessment. Sources include analyses and assessments from across DoD and other government agencies, think-tanks, academia, industry, allies, and mission partners. AF Strategy: A capstone document that looks out 30 years and explains how the AF will organize, train and equip to provide Global Vigilance, Global Reach, and Global Power in the future security environment. The Strategy describes the guiding principles used to influence and inform decisions related to organizational structures, planning, programming, acquisition and requirements. AF senior leadership updates the AF strategy as desired, nominally on a 4-year cycle. AF Strategic Master Plan (SMP): Translates the AF strategy into guidance, goals, and objectives in a 20-year timeframe. The SMP is the primary source document for the development and alignment of subordinate strategic planning across the entire AF. The alignment of AF priorities and goals to national guidance informs planning and actions at successively lower level of AF organizations and forms the basis for the development of future force options and performance management plans.  Business Rule: A business rule is a rule that must define or shall constrain some aspect of business and always resolves to either true or false. Business rules are intended to assert business structure or to control or influence the behavior of the business. Business rules describe the operations, definitions and constraints that apply to an organization. Capability: The ability to achieve a desired effect under specified standards and conditions through combinations of means and ways across the DOTMLPF-P to perform a set of tasks to execute a specified course of action (COA). Ref:  AFI 10-601  Version 4.1 126   Capability Development (CD): Includes all activities from opportunity or capability gap identification to warfighter employment. CD also aligns the execution of all lines of effort at the appropriate level, including gap analysis, Science & Technology (S&T), studies, wargaming, experimentation, development planning, requirements development, acquisition strategies, and investment strategies, to provide relevant capability to future warfighters. Capability Development Council (CDC): The AF CDC is a governance body designed to identify the key strategic questions related to operational capability which require AF senior leadership direction. It also serves as a verification body for new and ongoing capability development efforts. Ref: AF Capability Development Charter, May 2016. Capability Development Working Group (CDWG): An AF/A5R and SAF/AQR O-6 (or equivalent) led, cross-functional inclusive body that reports to AF/A5/8 to inform the appropriate AF processes. Primary function includes recommend prioritization of operational challenges and opportunities aligned with Strategy, Planning, and Programming, recommend ECCTs, synchronize high priority capability development activities across the AF enterprise, and assess the capability development activities against strategic objectives for adequacy, timeliness, and de-confliction. Capability Gap: The inability to execute a specified COA or valid AF mission area. The gap may be the result of no existing capability, lack of proficiency or sufficiency in an existing capability solution, or the need to replace an existing capability solution to prevent a future gap. Ref:  AFI 10-601 (adapted from Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 5123.01 & Joint Publication 1-02) Capability Solution (or Solution): A materiel or non-materiel opportunity or solution to satisfy one or more capability gaps/reduce or eliminate one or more capability gaps. Ref: Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) Manual Core Function Leads (CFL): SecAF/CSAF-designated leaders who serve as the principal integrators for their assigned Service Core Function (SCF) and the corresponding AF CFSPs. CFLs guide the SCF process and all SCF-related appropriation priorities by orchestrating the development of SCF in collaboration with key stakeholders across the AF to include Major Commends (MAJCOMs), the ARC, and functional authorities. CFLs have tasking authority with regard to SCF planning and programming issues to identify enabling capabilities in, and integration requirements/opportunities with, other SCFs, joint forces, civilian government and non-government organizations, and allied/partner nations. CFLs provide a prioritized SCF investment and O&M submission for HAF POM Integration. CFLs participate at all appropriate levels of the AFCS. For all SCF-specific governance structures, CFLs serve as chair or co-chair.  Core Function Support Plans (CFSP): Developed by CFLs, in collaboration with key stakeholders across the AF CFSPs align strategy, operating concepts, and capability development by SCF, to provide financial constructs for enhancing Global Vigilance, Global Reach, and  Version 4.1 127   Global Power across the range of military operations. Along with other internal and external products, the AFSEA, the AF SMP, and the SPG provide the strategic context for CFSP production. When developing CFSPs, CFLs must account for all related authoritative perspectives across the AF, including the perspectives of regional AF commands; and CFLs coordinate their CFSPs with all AF Functionals and OCRs prior to submission. CFLs update CFSPs every other year.  DOTMLPF-P: The DoD acronym that pertains to the eight possible non-materiel elements involved in solving warfighting capability gaps. These solutions may result from a Capabilities-Based Assessment or any study that investigates DoD warfighting capabilities and identifies capability gaps. DOTMLPF-P is cited in CJCSI 3170.01, JCIDS, and described in detail in the JCIDS Manual. DOTMLPF-P stands for:   Doctrine: the way we fight (e.g., emphasizing maneuver warfare, combined air-ground campaigns)   Organization: how we organize to fight (e.g., divisions, air wings, Marine-Air Ground Task Forces)    Training: how we prepare to fight tactically (basic training to advanced individual training, unit training, joint exercises, etc.)   Materiel: all the “stuff” necessary to equip our forces that DOES NOT require a new development effort (weapons, spares, test sets, etc. that are “off the shelf” both commercially and in the government)    Leadership and education: how we prepare our leaders to lead the fight (squad leader to 4-star general/admiral - professional development)   Personnel: availability of qualified people for peacetime, wartime, and various contingency operations   Facilities: real property, installations, and industrial facilities (e.g., government owned ammunition production facilities)   Policy:  DoD, interagency, or international policy that impacts the other seven non-materiel elements. Far-term: Eleven to 30 years into the future beyond the SPG-directed planning year. This timeframe represents a period of uncertain threats and environments. It tests the bounds of doctrine, tactics, and capabilities. Future Years Defense Program: Summarizes SECDEF-approved DoD programs. The FYDP projects detailed source requirements for 5 years and force structure for 9 years. Inputs: Information/data used during the completion of each activity is labeled as an information “Input.” Outputs: Information/data generated during the completion of each activity is labeled as an information “Output.”  Version 4.1 128   Mid-term: 6 to 10 years into the future beyond the SPG-directed planning year. This timeframe represents a period of anticipated threats, environments, doctrine, tactics, and capabilities. Near-term: 5 years into the future beginning with the SPG-directed planning year. This timeframe represents a period of expected threats, environments, doctrine, tactics, and capabilities. Planning Choice: An approach, disconnect, initiative, offset, or POM disconnect regarding future use of AF resources, that has not yet been approved for inclusion in the 30-Year Plan. The Planning Corporate Structure reviews these using the results of the SPF, at increasingly higher governance levels until agreement can be reached, and if not reached at one of the lower levels of governance (Planning Group/Board/Council), it is decided at the planning choices event chaired by SecAF/CSAF.  Resource Allocation Plan (RAP): The RAP is the data (spreadsheet) portion of the 30-Year Plan. The RAP narrative is the words that accompany the spreadsheet data that explain what we are doing, and when during the 30-Year Plan. The RAP and RAP narrative together comprise the 30-Year Plan.  SIPOC: SIPOC is a data collection form that assists in gathering information about Suppliers, Inputs, Processes, Outputs, and Customers of a process.    Supplier: Provide inputs into the process   Input: The material, service and/or information used by the process to produce an output    Process: A defined sequence of activities that deliver outputs to meet customer requirements   Outputs: The products, services, and/or information that result from the completion of a process   Customers: Users of the outputs produced by the process Strategic Planning Guidance (SPG): The SPG shapes the air, space, and cyberspace force by translating strategy into planning and programming guidance to meet national security objectives at the lowest overall risk possible given available resources. The SPG defines the AF position on Total Force Enterprise (TFE) force structure, readiness and sustainability, infrastructure, and modernization/recapitalization. The SPG links the AF SMP to CFSPs by providing Planning Guidance for force structure development, based upon the 20-Year Planning Force results of the previous cycle’s PFP Integration process. The SPG’s long-term major investment plan influences operational concept development, organizational change, and training plans, and provides parameters for requirements generation to produce the proper balance between current and future AF priorities. SPG Programming Guidance provides authoritative direction for AF POM development.  Strategic Planning Working Group (SPWG): An AF/A8X O-6 (or equivalent) led, cross-functional inclusive body that reports to AF/A5/8. Primary function includes planning force prioritization, investments, and trades aligned with Strategy, Planning, and Programming as  Version 4.1 129   informed by the CDC, coordinates CFL inputs via the CFSP process, and assesses the planning force against strategic objectives and CDC guidance. SPWG Key Stakeholders:   Panels: Agile Combat Support/Installation, Agile Combat Support/Logistics, Agile Combat Support/Personnel and Training, Agile Combat Support/Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation, Combat AFs, Global Integrated Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (GIISR)/Command and Control, Global Mobility, Nuclear Deterrence Operations, Space/Cyberspace, Total Force   SAF: AQ, CIO-A6, FM, IA, IE, LL, SP    Air Staff: A1, A2, A3, A4C, A4P, A5R, A5S, A9, A10, RE, NGB, ST   CFLs: Agile Combat Support, Air Superiority, Command and Control, Cyberspace Superiority, Education & Training, GIISR, Global Precision Attack, Nuclear Deterrence Operations, Personnel Recovery, Rapid Global Mobility, Special Operations, Space Superiority Strategic Prioritization Framework (SPF): This is a process designed to provide scalable AF enterprise-wide strategic initiative assessments and integration. The process includes objective and subjective variables designed for repeatable, consistent scoring of programs, initiatives, and offsets. It provides comparable information and data visualization on disparate AF programs/initiatives to support strategic decision making by senior leaders.    Version 4.1 130   IV.

SPPBE Concurrent Program and Budget Review Process The detailed SPPBE processes outlined in this playbook show the standard sequential process. This section of the playbook covers the differences if the Program and Budget Review are run concurrently. As a reminder, at a high-level, the SPPBE sequential process pushes work products from one phase to another for the current cycle and incorporates work products from previous cycles as a baseline.  The sequential process stated in this playbook allows the Programming and Budgeting processes adequate time to analyze and mitigate Programmatic Issue Papers prior to BES submission. The Budget review then begins and leads to the PB submission. The sequential process utilizes the PDM to pass programmatic decisions to the services. The final BES position is reviewed by OSD Comptroller and instantiated by PBDs. The high-level sequential process is illustrated in Figure VII_1. Figure VII_1 – SPPBE High-Level Sequential PDM Process: PlanningProgrammingProgram Defense(PDM Process)Budgeting(BES)Review and Defend the BES and Deliver the PBExecutionSequential ProcessesResolved with BillOffsets Alternatively, OSD may impact the SPPBE processes by reviewing the Program and the Budget concurrently. Budget and issue papers are released at the same time and worked by the AF. When this occurs, the AF’s SPPBE process reacts and alternates to a different process where Issue Papers are categorized and separated by content as Programmatic Issue Papers or Budget Issue Papers for analysis and mitigation respectively by Programming or Budgeting.  The Programming Issue Paper process initiates after receiving the Programmatic Issue Papers from OSD and a team lead is assigned by AF/A8P to manage mitigation and adjudication of the identified issue. An analysis is conducted and prepared by the Issue Team in the form of a brief to represent the AF position to the OSD Issue Team. A multitude of issues will be dealt with at the same time. The adjudication of the issue follows the same process as the sequential issue, OSD Issue Team, AF/A5/8, and finally the DMAG. Upon completion of the review of all the issues, OSD CAPE adjudicates the response and drafts the OSD recommendation in the form of the Programmatic RMD. The Programmatic RMD is reviewed by AF/A8P. AF/A8P coordinates with AF Leadership before final agreement on the Programmatic RMD by both the AF and OSD. Concurrently with the Programmatic Issue Papers, the Budgeting Issue Paper process initiates after receiving the Budget Issue Papers from OSD and a team lead is assigned by SAF/FMB to  Version 4.1 157   57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 manage mitigation and adjudication of the identified issue. An analysis is conducted and the AF position is prepared by the Budget Issue Team and transmitted to the OSD Comptroller. Upon reviewing the AF response brief, OSD Comptroller adjudicates the response and drafts the OSD recommendation in the form of the Budget RMD. The Budget RMD is received by SAF/FMB for assessment and any major budget issues are resolved between the CSAF and SecAF and the most senior leaders of OSD. The Budget RMD is then finalized by OSD Comptroller. Upon signing both the Programmatic RMD and Budget RMD, the Budgeting process reviews and incorporates all the guidance in both RMDs into the baseline for the PB Submission. The high-level concurrent process is illustrated in Figure VII_2.
