Authorized Cost and Scope Variations. Congress approves each MILCON project at a specific authorized and appropriated cost and scope. Title 10 United States Code, Section 2853, authorizes a cost increase or decrease of not more than 25 percent of the amount appropriated or 200 percent of the unspecified minor construction project ceiling, whichever is less, if required for the sole purpose of meeting unusual variations in cost that could not have been reasonably anticipated at the time Congress authorized the project. Section 2853 also authorizes a scope decrease of not more that 25 percent of the amount specified in the project data provided to Congress, provided the result is a complete and usable project that fully meets the mission requirement stated in the justification provided to Congress. Cost variations and scope decreases exceeding these limits may be approved by the Service Secretary provided  the Congressional Defense Committees are notified in writing. Section 2853 authorizes a scope increase of not more than 10 percent of the amount specified in the project data provided to Congress provided the Service Secretary notifies the Congressional Defense Committees in writing. In accordance with OSD policy, scope increases up to 10 percent may be approved only if necessary due to changed facility planning factors, changed technology and related design criteria, unforeseen site conditions, or finalized boundary surveys. (T-0) Do not increase authorized scope due to increased or changed functional requirements. (T-0) Scope variations shall be measured against the scope of distinct facilities represented in Block 9 of the DD Form 1391 authorized by Congress. (T-0)  Scope variation is expressed as a percentage for each distinct facility. (T-0) The HAF-AFIMSC-AFCEC PgMP, Management Controls, summarizes and updates the controls in place to manage the MILCON execution program. MILCON program managers at all levels must be familiar with these controls to ensure proper authority and/or notification is sought in the appropriate situation. Use the tables in the HAF-AFIMSC-AFCEC PgMP as an initial source for taking appropriate MILCON execution actions.  (Add the following paragraph):  2.6.2.2.1.  Congress must be notified in accordance with 10 USC § 2853, Authorized Cost and Scope of Work Variations, including mandatory waiting periods, before any cost or scope increases or decreases are considered approved.

Except  as  provided  below, procedures,  and  guidance  shall  govern  facilities  planning,  design,  acquisition, construction, sustainment, modernization, and disposal actions at Joint Bases. 1.4.12.2.1.1.  To  the  extent  required  and  only  when  providing  unique  mission related  capabilities,  the  supported  Component's  unique  planning,  architectural and/or  design  and  construction  criteria  shall  be  used,  even  when  those  unique AFI32-1023  19 NOVEMBER 2015 9 mission  related  capabilities  and/or  criteria  may  conflict  with  the  supporting Component's criteria. 1.4.12.2.1.2.  Where the AF is the supported component on a JB, the installation shall  ensure  that  the  relevant  MOA  or  other  support  agreement  with  the supporting  component  requires  Wing  Commander  approval  of  design  and construction of facilities’ impacting the airfield/airspace and airfield operations. 1.4.12.2.1.3.  In  accordance  with  the  Joint  Base  Implementation  Guide  (JBIG) published by the Office of the Deputy Secretary of Defense, Air National Guard and  Army  National  Guard  facilities  and  land  are  tenant  property  and  do  not constitute a supported component. 1.4.12.2.2.  Except  as  provided  below,  the  supporting  Component's  DA/CA  shall  be used for all MILCON at Joint Bases. 1.4.12.2.2.1.  For  supported  Component  projects  actively  in  design,  under construction,  or  pending  final  acceptance  when  JB  formed,  the  supported Component's assigned design/construction agent  shall maintain responsibility for the construction project through financial completion, at which point the DA/CA of  the  supporting  Component  shall  ensure  that  the  preparation  and  submittal  of final  DD  Form  1354,  Transfer  and  Acceptance  of  Military  Real  Property  is completed  by  the  installation  Public  Works  organization  or  installation  Real Property  Office  –  whether  that  be  BCE,  Department  of  Public Works  (DPW)  or NAVFAC.  (T-1) 1.4.12.2.3.  New  Construction.  The  Component  generating  a  new  construction requirement  is  responsible  for  programming  the  necessary  planning,  design, construction and sustainment funding.  The Component generating an increase to the Joint Base population is responsible for any new programming, planning, design and construction  needed  to  expand  installation  support  facilities  to  accommodate  the population increase.  In all cases, reuse of existing facilities is the preferred approach over new construction whenever feasible. 1.4.12.2.4.  Demolition  and  Disposal.  The  organization the  new construction  is  responsible  for  demolition  of  their  vacated  buildings.    If  another Component  occupies  the  vacated  buildings,  follow-on  demolition  responsibility  is relinquished.  In all cases, demolition of facilities no longer needed as a result of new construction  shall  be  accomplished  at  the  earliest  opportunity  after  funds  are available. requiring 1.5.  Requirements Development: 1.5.1.  The  DM/CM  shall  ensure  that  design  and  construction  of  a  proposed  construction project for which they are responsible is in conformance with the following documents:  (T-1) 1.5.1.1.  Installation  Development  Plan  (IDP).  Installation  Development  Plans  (IDP) includes  specific  Area  Development  Plans  (ADP)  and  are  required  at  all  Air  Force installations.    The  IDP  is  a  summary  document  that  provides  information  at  an appropriate level of detail for the installation, the command, and other decision-makers to 10 AFI32-1023  19 NOVEMBER 2015 understand the character and structure of the installation, and its development  potential.  to  AFI  32-7062,  Air  Force  Comprehensive  Planning  which  provides Refer responsibilities  and  requirements  for  comprehensive  planning  and  describes  procedures for developing, implementing, and maintaining the IDP.  The DM/CM and DA/CA shall ensure  that  the  Designer  of  Record  (DOR)  provides  designs  for  infrastructure  systems and facility construction that conform to requirements of the IDP and ADP. 1.5.1.2.  Area  Development  Plan  (ADP).  An  ADP  is  developed  by  the  base  for  a specific area and/or functional  use.  The ADP provides the notional  vision necessary to assess  the  site  requirements  for  a  project  and  outline  mitigation  for  future  use  with  a special focus on the installation area where the project is located and its mission capacity.  Refer to the IDP for the ADP requirements of a specific project. 1.5.1.3.  Planning  Charrette  Reports  (Level  I  and  Level  II).  Planning  Charrette Reports-Levels  I  and  II  (PCR-I  and  PCR-II)  document  and  provide  a  basis  for understanding,  describing  and  quantifying  project  requirements    (refer  to  Attachment  1, Terms for additional definition).  PCR-I  and PCR-II also  provide the basis for cost  and scope development and refinement of the draft DD Form 1391.  The DOR shall use the PCR-II obtained from AFCEC, COE/NAVFAC, or Installation Contracting Office as the principle basis of project design or Request for Proposal (RFP) development. 1.5.1.3.1.  PCR-I.  The  BCE  initiates  the  PCR-I  as  early  as  possible  involving  as many  stakeholders  of  the  Project  Delivery  Team  (PDT)  as  practical.    Refer  to attachment  1  for  additional  clarification.  Inclusion  of  environmental  planning  / environmental impact analysis process (EIAP) staff is critical to ensure the approach for  environmental  impact  analysis  can  be  shaped  and  environmental  issues  can  be avoided, through siting, if possible.   1.5.1.3.2.  PCR-II.  The  DM/CM  initiates  a  PCR-II.  It  further  defines/validates  the need  and  provides  a  refined  draft  DD  Form  1391and  seek  opportunities  to  optimize cost  and  scope  with  updates  to  the  scope  and  cost  to  the  1391.  Cost,  scope optimization  and  economic  analysis  are  required  throughout  the  life  of  Air  Force construction  projects  and  shall  be  included  in  both  the  PCR-I  and  PCR-II,  see paragraph 2.2.1.3., Cost Management below. 1.5.1.3.3.  PCR  Funding.  The PCR-I and PCR-II are considered advanced planning activities;  therefore  Operations  and  Maintenance  (O&M)  funds  are  used  for  its preparation.  Centralized  sustainment  will  be  provided  as  outlined  in  the  AFCEC FSRM  Business  Rules.    See  the  WBDG  website  for  a  PCR  document  template.  Ensure  that  development  of  the  PCR-I  and  PCR-II  requirements  follow  those  in  the HAF-AFCEC PgMP, Attachment 1, Planning Activities, found at WBDG website. 1.5.1.4.  Project  Management  Plan  (PMP).  The  PMP  presents  the  strategic  decisions on the project schedule, design, acquisition, and construction that are agreed upon by the project  stakeholders.    The  DM/CM  will  take  the  lead  in  preparing  the  PMP.    The  PMP should be attached to any planning or design instruction issued for a particular MILCON project.    Additionally,  the  PMP  shall  be  compared  to  the  HAF-AFCEC  Program Management  Plan  for  Air  Force  MILCON  Execution  to  ensure  both  documents  are  in alignment.  A PMP template can be found  at  the WBDG website, Construction Criteria Base section. AFI32-1023  19 NOVEMBER 2015 11 1.5.1.5.  Project  Siting.  Refer  to  AFI  32-7062,  Comprehensive  Planning,  and  AFI  32-1021,  Planning  and  Programming  Military  Construction  (MILCON)  Projects.    The designer shall coordinate significant variations from the ADP with the PDT stakeholders before design progresses. (T-1). Re-siting projects during design shall be avoided unless life-cycle cost effective or mission failure would occur. 1.5.1.6.  National  Environmental  Policy  Act  (NEPA).  Project  re-siting  will  occur  in coordination  with  the  environmental  planning  functions  designated  representative,  to ensure project siting in a manner consistent with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)  process.    (T-0)    This  representative  also  needs  to  be  present  to  record  which alternative  sites  were  considered  but  not  carried  forward,  to  document  alternatives consideration as part of the Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP).  Assessment of alternatives is not required for environmental studies or reviews in foreign nations in accordance  with  DoDD  6050.7  Environmental  Effects  Abroad  of  Major  Department  of Defense Actions (codified at 32 CFR part 187).  Once the project and its alternatives have been sufficiently developed, NEPA may proceed; refer to paragraph 2.2.4.2 for guidance on the EIAP. 1.5.1.6.1.  Key roles of NEPA execution are the responsibility of the NGB on behalf of the Air National Guard. 1.6.  Air Force Program Oversight: 1.6.1.  Goals  and  Metrics.  The  management  tool  for  performance  measurement  of  the  Air Force  design  and  construction  program  is  a  set  of  cradle-to-grave  metrics  called  the  USAF MILCON  Ribbon  Cutter.    The  Ribbon  Cutter  Implementation  Guide  can  be  found  on  the WBDG    website.  Its    purpose  is  to  provide  accountability  and  program  management expectations  and  capability  from  planning  through  financial  closeout.    It  is  intended  to measure performance of all members of the PDT, especially DM/CMs, DA/CAs, and project programmers.    The  goals  and  metrics  are  codified  in  the  Air  Force  Military  Construction Program  Management  Plans.    HQ  AFCEC  has  overall  responsibility  for  managing  the  AF MILCON  program  and  is  responsible  for  documenting  project  data  in  Automated  Civil Engineering  System-Project  Management  (ACES-PM)  throughout  contract  execution, (design and construction phases through financial closeout).  Installations and MAJCOMs are responsible  for  data  in  ACES-PM  during  the  Planning  and  Programming  phases.    (T-1)  Additionally errors and/or omissions that occurred during the planning and/or programming phases  shall  be  resolved  by  the  installation  and  MAJCOM  planners  and/or  programmers regardless of project phase. 1.6.2.  Automated  Civil  Engineering  System-Project  Management  (ACES-PM).  ACES- PM is  the Air Force management information  system  used by Air Force  Civil  Engineers to manage  planning,  design,  and  construction  programs.    It  is  used  to  provide  management assessments  of  project  cost,  major  milestones,  and  to  provide  an  indicator  to  position construction  funds  with  the  Construction  Agent  (CA).    Timely,  accurate  ACES-PM  data entry  is  essential  through  the  course  of  the  project  life.    The  DM/CM  will  be  the  primary person  that  updates  ACES-PM  during  contract  execution,  design  and  construction  through financial completion.  (T-1)  The DM/CM will also update and track NAF projects in ACES-PM.  When constructing NAF projects,  AFPC/SVXF will provide the DM/CM information needed to keep the ACES-PM current. 12 AFI32-1023  19 NOVEMBER 2015 Chapter 2 DESIGN PROCEDURES 2.1.  Scope:  This  chapter  addresses  design  procedures  and  directives  for  Air  Force  MILCON projects.  For ANG & AFR see section 1.2.9 & 1.4.10.

Construction  Operations Building  Information Exchange (COBie) may be adopted by  UFGS  after publication of this AFI. 2.2.2.  Cost  Management.  Use  life-cycle  cost  analysis  and  value  engineering  (VE)  to manage and optimize project costs.  Cost optimization takes into account upfront capital cost savings  and  long-term  life-cycle  savings  (lower  maintenance  cost/better  durability).  Cost control requires continual  systematic cost  management beginning with  PCR-I development, programming, PCR-II development,  design, construction and continuing throughout  the life of  the  facility.    The  cost-benefit  analysis,  and  life-cycle  cost  analysis  are  methods  for evaluating project cost effectiveness. AFI32-1023  19 NOVEMBER 2015 15 2.2.2.1.  Life  Cycle  Cost.  Programming  and  design  decisions  for  all types  of construction will be based on life-cycle cost of the facility. (T-1)  Use the present value discounting approach described in AFI 65-501, Economic Analysis, and AFMAN 65-506, Economic Analysis, unless otherwise specified.  Because NAF funded projects may use a different  decision-making  process,  contact the  funding  organization  for  further information.    All  life-cycle  cost  analyses  are  as  defined  by  Title  10  Code  of  Federal Regulations Part 436, Federal Energy Management and Planning Programs.  To prepare a  life-cycle  analysis,  use  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology  (NIST) Handbook  135,  Life-Cycle  Costing  Manual  for  the  Federal  Energy  Management Program,  and  the  Annual  Supplement  to  Handbook  135,  Energy  Price  Indices  and Discount Factors for Life- Cycle Cost Analysis. 2.2.2.2.  Value  Engineering  (VE).  Value  engineering  is  used  to  analyze  and  improve design  and  construction  projects  by  achieving  an  optimum  balance  between  function, performance, quality, safety, and cost.  Conduct VE studies early in the design process as soon  as  adequate  information  is  available.  Office  of  Management  and  Budget  (OMB) Circular  No:  A-131,  dated  December  26,  2013,  is  the  Federal  Directive  that  requires federal  agencies  to  consider  and  use  Value  Engineering  (VE)  as  a  management  tool  to ensure  realistic  budgets  and  maintain  acceptable  quality  in  program  and  acquisition functions.  The OMB Circular currently requires VE for new projects and programs when the  project  cost  estimate  is  at  least  $5  million  or  such  lower  dollars  threshold  as determined by the Senior Accountable Official (SAO) and identified in the agency’s VE guidelines.    Component  shall  comply  with  DoD  Instruction  4245.14,  “DoD  Value Engineering (VE) Program.  2.2.2.2.1.  VE  Requirements.  A formal third-party VE study shall be performed on Air  Force  Military  Construction  (MILCON)  projects  with  a  Programmed  Amount (PA)  over  $5  million.    The  Air  Force    DA/CA  will  determine  which  MILCON  will receive  formal  VE.    Informal  (in-house,  Agent)  VE  analysis,  incorporating  VE principles/guidelines, will be prepared for projects between $2 and $5 million. (T-1)  A VE study shall not eliminate features required to comply with Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) standards and other laws. (T-0)  See paragraph 2.2.1.14.   2.2.3.  Architect-Engineer (A-E) Selection and Services.  A-E services are described below: 2.2.3.1.  Design  Phase  (Title  I):    These  services  are  related  to  preparing  a  specific construction project design prior to construction contract award and consist of conducting field surveys, site investigations and studies to obtain design data, and preparing design analyses, technical calculations, contract plans, specifications, and cost estimates.    Title 10, United States Code 9540 limits that portion of A-E’s fee for direct design services to 6% of the estimated cost of  construction for producing and delivering the design, plans, drawings, and specifications needed for a construction project.   2.2.3.2.  Construction  Phase  (Title  II)  and  Supervision,  Inspection  and  Overhead (SIOH).  Title  II  services  are  defined  as  services  provided  by  A-E,  in-house  personnel, construction management firms, or other services during the construction project.  Title II services  are  related  to  specific  or  proposed  construction  project  and  consist  of observation, inspection, and documentation of construction progress.   SIOH is  a funded cost  and  must  be  included  in  the  project  estimate  for  purposes  of  determining  approval 16 AFI32-1023  19 NOVEMBER 2015 thresholds.    SIOH  pays  for  contract  administration,  project  management,  and  general overhead costs of the Agent  organization.     SIOH can be used to  fund Title  II services which  may  include  construction  inspections  performed  by  A-E  firms,  and  technical interpretation of proposed contract changes (such as change orders or value engineering change proposals).   (ADP), 2.2.3.3.  Other  A-E  Services.  These  services  are  design  and  construction-related services, but are not connected with a specific construction project.  The services consist of  developing  Installation  Development  Plans  (IDP)  with  associated  Area  Development Plans (per  FAR  Subpart  36.6  Architect-Engineer  Services;  36.601-4 Implementation),  design  criteria,  fact  finding  studies,  surveys,  investigations,  and  the performance of environmental projects involving prevention, compliance, and restoration when  the  services  of  registered  architects  or  engineers  are  required.    Excluded  are services  that  need  not  be  performed  by  a  registered  engineer  or  architect  such  as providing design and construction equipment or computer programs. 2.2.3.4.  Authorities.  Title  10  United  States  Code  Sections  2807(a),  Architectural  and Engineering  Services  and  Design,  Title  10  United  States  Code  Section  9540(a), Architectural and Engineering Services, and the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement  (DFARS)  236.606-70  authorize  contracting  for  and  administration  of  A-E services for project design.  Title 10 United States Code, Sections 4540, 7212 and 9540 limit  the  portion  of  the A-E’s  fee  for  producing  contract  plans  and  specifications  to  six percent of the estimated cost of the construction project. (T-0)  The six percent (6%) limit also  applies  to  construction  contract  modifications  (see  DFARS  Subpart  236.6.).    This limitation does not include site investigations, studies and surveys or other services that are  not  an  integral  part  of  the  production  and  delivery  of  plans,  designs,  and specifications.  Title 40 United States Code, Sections 1101 – 1104, commonly called the Brooks  Act,  provides  the  authority,  definitions,  and  basic  procedures  for  the  Federal Government’s selection of A-E firms for professional services on facility projects.  Title 10  United  States  Code,  Section  2855(a)  applies  the  Brooks  Act  to  military  construction (however, the Brooks Act is not applicable to NAF contracting).  For additional guidance, refer  to  Defense  Federal  Acquisition  Regulation  Supplement  (DFARS)  Subpart  236.6, Architect-Engineer  Services  and  Air  Force  Federal  Acquisition  Regulation  Supplement (AFFARS),  Part  5336,  Construction  and  Architect-Engineer  Contracts.    Procedures  for the execution of reserve component funds issued under Title 10 USC, Section18233(e are described in ANGRC ETL 1. 2.2.3.5.  The  Federal  Business  Opportunities  (FedBizOpps  or  FBO)  Synopsis Review.  The  FBO  announcement  is  a  key  document  in  the  A-E  selection  process.    It identifies  proposed,  specific  contract  actions.    Public  announcements  for  A-E  services will reflect the minimum needs of the government, not arbitrarily restrict  eligible firms, and  described  the  work  required  and  selection  criteria  in  sufficient  detail  to  facilitate  a meaningful  selection  of  the  most  highly  qualified  firm.  In  the  case  of  indefinite delivery/indefinite  quantity  (IDIQ)  contracts,  the  FBO  synopsis  identifies  contract requirements based on projected, yet uncertain requirements. 2.2.3.5.1.  A-E Contracts on Specific Projects.  On projects where the AF is the DA, the BCE in the case of installation contracts, or the respective directors of AFCEC in the  case  of  AFCEC  contracts,  shall  approve  the  technical  data  to  be  included  in  the AFI32-1023  19 NOVEMBER 2015 17 FBO  synopsis,  prior  to  submitting  this  information  to  the  CO,  to  ensure  it  properly describes the requirement.  (T-1) 2.2.3.5.2.  IDIQ  Contracts.  Pursuant to  FAR 36.602-2 (a), pre-selection  boards  are authorized.  Additionally, boards shall be chaired by registered professional engineers or architects.  The BCE in the case of installation contracts, or the AFCEC Director in the  case  of  AFCEC  contracts,  shall  approve  the  technical  data  to  be  included  in  the FBO  synopsis,  prior  to  submitting  this  information  to  the  CO,  to  ensure  it  properly describes  the  requirements,  the  geographical  coverage,  and  provides  an  appropriate capacity relative to projected requirements.  NAF contracting offices may have their own NAF IDIQ A-E contracts.  (T-1)  Contact the funding organization for guidance. 2.2.3.6.  A-E Slate Selection Approval.  Approval authority for A-E selection is outlined in DFARS 236.6. 2.2.3.6.1.  Approval  Authority.  For  all  A-E  services,  (Title  I,  Title  II,  IDPs,  Other Services,  and  IDIQs),  the  BCE  will  provide  slate  selection  approval  authority  for services  exceeding  $1,000,000  per  contract.    (T-1)    Similarly,  for  contracts  at MAJCOM Civil Engineer or  AFCEC,  slate selection approval  authority  for services exceeding  $1,000,000  per  contract,  will  be  obtained  from  their  respective  directors.  Note:  slate  selection  approval  authorizes  the  BCE  to  select  A-Es  to  provide  the required services; approval is not for the selected ‘slate’ of A-E service providers. 2.2.3.6.2.  Notification Action (A-E Fees Greater than $1,000,000).  When the cost of  A-E  design  services  for  a  project,  or  a  group  of  related  projects,  is  estimated  to exceed $1,000,000, Congress must be notified in accordance with 10 USC § 2807(b), Architectural  &  Engineering  Services  and  Construction  Design,  before  award  or obligation  of  funds.    (T-0)    Notification  action  is  also  required  for  project  design undertaken  by  government  personnel,  as  well  as  for  A-E  services  and  construction design  planned  for  projects  that  are  Congressional  inserts  or  directed  designs.  AF/A4CF  will  initiate  this  Congressional  notification,  notify  AFCEC  when  it  has been sent to SAF/IEE, and notify the MAJCOM and AFCEC when SAF/IEE (through SAF/LL  and  SAF/FMBL)  submits  the  notification  package  to  Congress.    (See DFARS  Subpart  236.601  for  the  content  of  the  Congressional  notification  and timeline  requirements).    Notification  must  be  completed  (including  the  wait  period) prior  to  start  of  any  design,  including  that  performed  by  government  personnel.  Staffing  actions  for  10  USC  §  2807  notification  typically  take  30–45  days.    During the notification waiting period, public announcement of the plan to initiate design on a  particular  military  construction  project  may  be  made  and  administrative  actions leading  to  award  of  the  A-E  contract  may  be  started,  but  no  actions  that  obligate government funds may be undertaken. 2.2.3.6.2.1.  When  a  large  project  or  several  projects  for  the  same  functional purpose with total A-E costs of $1,000,000 or more are undertaken, Congressional notification  is  required  prior  to  the  start  of  design  for  any  portion  of  the undertaking, even though the project design may be subdivided into several A-E contracts  or  a  combination  of  A-E  contracts  and  design  performed  in-house  by government personnel.  Notification is required even though the design costs for such portion may be less than the reporting threshold specified by law. 18 AFI32-1023  19 NOVEMBER 2015 2.2.3.6.2.2.  Planning and design (P&D) funds expended to AFCEC, USACE and NAVFAC  to  award  and  administer  A-E  contracts  are  separate  from  the  services themselves  and  do  not  apply  to  the  10  USC  §  2807  threshold.    All  other  costs funded with  P&D funds  apply to  the threshold.    For  a design-build contract,  the design  effort  after construction contract  award accomplished by the construction contractor  is  funded  with  construction  dollars  and  is  not  applicable  to  the threshold.    However,  preparation  of  a  Request  for  Proposal  (RFP)  for  a  design-build  contract  is  considered  A-E  services  and  is  subject  to  the  10  USC  §  2807 notification requirements. 2.2.3.6.2.3.  For  projects  executed  as  design-build,  a  project-specific  design  cost estimate  will  normally  be  made  and  used  as  the  basis  for  determining  the notification requirements.  In the absence of a design cost estimate, six percent of the  programmed  amount  will  be  used  by  AF/A4CF  as  the  estimated  design  cost for the purpose of determining notification requirements. 2.2.3.6.2.4.  The level of effort authorized by a design instruction (3%, 15%, 35%, 100%,  etc.)  has  no  bearing  on  the  Congressional  notification  requirement,  as notification must be completed prior to start of any design. 2.2.3.6.2.5.  If  there  is  any  perceived  potential  for  reaching  the  Congressional notification  threshold,  prior  notification  should  be  made.    In  the  case  where  no notification has been made and the threshold is  approached after start  of  design, project managers must notify AF/A4CF and request further guidance. 2.2.3.6.2.6.  Notwithstanding 10 USC § 2807 requirements, procurement/financial management  regulations  may,  in  some  cases,  also  require  Congressional notification.    The  guidance  provided  here  does  not  relieve  the  requirement  to comply  with  procurement/financial  management regulations  governing notification. 2.2.3.7.  Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee  Contracts.  Advance  approval  by the  Secretary  of Defense  or  designee  is  required  for  the  use  of  cost-plus-fixed-fee  contracts  that  are funded by a military construction appropriations act that are estimated to exceed $25,000 and  will  be  performed  within  the  U.S.,  except  Alaska.    Refer  to  DFARS,  Subpart 216.306, Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee Contracts for further guidance.  (T-0) 2.2.4.  Environmental Criteria: 2.2.4.1.  Environmental Quality Standards.  All projects must meet applicable federal, state,  and  local  environmental  standards  and  regulations  in  the  U.S.,  its  trust  territories and possessions.  (T-0)  All projects in foreign countries must comply with an applicable international  agreement,  country-specific  final  governing  standards  or  the  Oversees Baseline  Environmental  Guidance  Document  (whichever  applies)  and  geographic combatant  command,  and  DoDI  4715.05,  Environmental  Compliance  at  Installations outside  the  United  States,  November  1,  2013  and  DoDI  4715.08,  Remediation  of Environmental Contamination outside the United States, November 1, 2013.  2.2.4.2.  Environmental  Impact  Analysis  Process  (EIAP).  EIAP  is  the  Air  Force procedure for complying with NEPA.  Ensure all construction projects comply with Title 32 Code of Federal  Regulations, Part 989,  Environmental Impact  Analysis Process,  and AFI32-1023  19 NOVEMBER 2015 19 that  all  design  and  construction  decisions  are  consistent  with  the  results  of  the  process.  (T-0)    The  process,  including  permits,  should  be  complete  prior  to  concept  design completion  to  facilitate  incorporation  of  mitigation  and/or  required  actions  into  the design;  in  all  cases  this  must  be  done  prior  to  advertising  for  construction.    In  order  to properly  conduct  EIAP,  the  appropriate  environmental  planning  functional  (EPF) representative  must  be  notified  and  invited  to  participate  in  the  MILCON  planning charrettes to ensure that proper consideration of alternatives is conducted, and to ensure a plan is developed for the completion of EIAP.   The EPF may be a base-level POC or a POC from the AFCEC/CZ, depending on the scale of the MILCON project.  The EIAP should address  all environmental  constraints within and surrounding the  projects’ limits of construction.  Follow the requirements and work practices in Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations, Parts 1500-1508, National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as Amended; EO  12114,  Environmental  Effects  Abroad  of  Major  Federal  Actions;  DoD  Directive 6050.7, Environmental Effects Abroad of Major Department of Defense Actions; and AFI 32-7061, The Environmental Impact Analysis Process which has been codified within 32 CFR  Part  989,  AFI  32-7001,  Environmental  Management  for  overall  Environmental Quality  standards,  and AFI  90-2002,  Air  Force Interactions  with  Federally  Recognized Tribes.    Also,  for  real  estate  issues  comply  with  requirements  of  AFI  32-7066, Environmental Baseline Surveys (EBS) in Real Estate Transactions.  The AF Form 813, Request for Environmental Impact Analysis, is used for documenting the need to conduct environmental  analysis  or  the  application  of  certain  Categorical  Exclusions  (CATEXs).  CATEXs  are  not  appropriate  at  overseas  locations.    AFI  32-1021,  “Planning  and Programming  Military  Construction  (MILCON)  projects”  requires  a  Certificate  of Compliance addressing the status on compliance with various environmental regulations including  EIAP.    The  Certificate  of  Compliance  is  summarized  in  the  DD  Form  1391. Complete the certificate at the time the project is presented to the Air Staff for review and approval to be included in the AF budget request. 2.2.4.3.  Floodplains and Wetlands Regulations.

Refer  to  AFI  65-601  V1, Budget Guidance and Procedure. 2.6.1.1.  Authorizations for Air Force MILCON projects expire after 30 September of the second year after the FY of the original authorization (e.g., a project authorized in FY14 expires at the end of FY16), or on the date the President signs the new National Defense AFI32-1023  19 NOVEMBER 2015 23 Authorization Act in the third FY (FY17 from the previous example), whichever date is later. 2.6.1.2.  Air Force should Congress to enact an extension of the authorization in the third year of the act or the authorization will expire.  The DM/CM should submit requests for extension of authorization to AF/A4CF no later than 30 November each year.  (T-0) 2.6.1.3.  Partial  awards  (intended  to  keep  an  authorization  from  expiring)  must  involve construction  placement  rather  than  the  purchase  of  government-furnished  material  or equipment and must include a significant portion (greater than 50%) of the product work.  T-1). 2.6.1.4.  Funds  appropriated  in  an  FY  for  a  MILCON  project  may  remain  available  for obligations  beyond  that  FY  to  the  extent  provided  in  appropriation  acts.    MILCON appropriations generally  are available for obligation for five FYs.  Refer to AFI 65-601 V1 for use of expired funds. 2.6.2.  Cost and Scope Control: 2.6.2.1.  MILCON    Congress  approves  each  MILCON  project  at  a  specific  authorized and  appropriated  cost  and  scope.  (T-0)    Title  10  United  States  Code,  Section  2853, authorizes  a  cost  increase  or  decrease  of  not  more  than  25  percent  of  the  amount appropriated or 200 percent of the minor construction project ceiling, whichever is less.  The  project  scope  may  be  reduced  by  not  more  than  25  percent  of  that  specified  to Congress; however, there is no provision for an increase in the project scope identified on the DD Form 1391.  It is imperative that managers understand that a cost variation shall not be used to increase project scope.  The HAF-AFCEC PgMP, Management Controls, summarizes  and  updates  the  controls  in  place  to  manage  the  MILCON  execution program.  A copy of the HAF-AFCEC PgMP can be obtained from the WBDG website.  MILCON program managers at all levels must be familiar with these controls to ensure proper authority and/or notification is sougin the appropriate situation.  Use the tables in the  HAF-AFCEC  PgMP  as  an  initial  source  for  taking  appropriate  MILCON  execution actions. 2.6.2.2.  Reprogramming  and  Notification.    Reprogramming  and  notification  actions will be performed in accordance with all applicable requirements as outlined in the HAF-AFCEC  PgMP;  Management  Controls.  (T-1).  AFCEC  will  prepare  all  documentation, coordinate  with  the  MAJCOMs  for  project  reprogramming,  and  submit  requests  to AF/A4CF for further action. 2.6.2.3.  Funding  Changes.

The AFCEC/CFEK office is the DA for the United Kingdom. Design Manager (DM)—The Air Force organization designated to manage the design, provide Air Force interface with the Design Agent, and provide updates on design milestones to the Air Staff and MAJCOMs for specific projects. Deviation—A  deviation  provides  authority  to  deviate  from  a  specific  technical  criteria requirement  in  a  Unified  Facility  Criteria  (UFC),  model  building  code,  or  other  facility 38 AFI32-1023  19 NOVEMBER 2015 engineering criteria document for an indefinite period of time.  Deviations are valid for a specific project in a specific facility and are not generic approvals to deviate from criteria.  Deviations are often described as long term, or permanent  criteria deviations.  Refer to  most recent version of MIL-STD-3007F, Standard Practice for Unified Facilities Criteria and Unified Facilities Guide Specification. HAF(A4CF)  -  AFCEC  Program  Management  Plan  for  Air  Force  MILCON  Execution (HAF-AFCEC PgMP)—The purpose of this plan is to provide the contextual framework for the working  relationship  between  Headquarters  Air  Force  (HAF)  Civil  Engineer,  Facilities Management  Division  (A4CF)  and  the  Air  Force  Civil  Engineer  Center  (AFCEC)  for  Military Construction  (MILCON).    This  plan  applies  to  all  Air  Force  MILCON  where  AFCEC  is designated (DM/CM)  or  Design Agent/Construction Agent (DA/CA). the  Design  Manager/Construction  Manager as Inspection—The  CA  and  contractors’  inspection  duties  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  such items  as  checking  layout  of  the  construction  in  the  field  and  safety  compliance;  inspecting workmanship and materials to determine conformity with contract documents.  They also include reviewing  laboratory  tests  and  analyses  of  materials;  completing  and  submitting  field  and progress reports; and checking monthly and final estimates as a basis for payment. Military  Construction  Program  (MILCON)—The  program  approved  annually  by  the Congress  in  the  DoD  Authorization  and  Military  Construction  Acts,  plus  individual  projects authorized pursuant to standing project authority provided by Congress in Title 10 of the United States Code. Planning  Charrette  Reports  Levels  I  and  II  (PCR-I  and  PCR-II)—These documents  serve the same purpose as those formerly designated as Requirements Documents Levels I and II (RD-I and RD-II).  The final version of the HAF-AFCEC PgMP eliminated the terms RD-I and RD-II.  The purpose of the PCR-I is to document the methodology used by the initial planning charrette team to establish the cost and scope of the preliminary draft DD Form 1391.  The PCR-II is the result of a follow-on planning charrette which uses the PCR-I and draft Form 1391 as a basis to produce  a  more  comprehensive  document  to  validate  the  requirements  in  the  PCR-I  and  to develop the intermediate draft Form 1391.  The PCR-II provides the follow-on designer a basis for understanding and further developing the project requirements through the phases of design.  Note:  See  HAF-AFCEC  PgMP;  Appendix  B  for  design  and  construction  codes,  planning  and design activities. Project  Delivery  Team  (PDT)—The project  delivery team  consists of all project  stakeholders and  contributing  participants  through  each  stage  of  the  MILCON  delivery  process.    The  PDT produces optimum project  results from  an integrated approach over the entire delivery process.  All  team  members  provide  an  essential  perspective  and  role  throughout  the  process  as  their contributions  are  leveraged  from  conceptual  requirement  planning  through  construction completion.  A PDT should include the primary stakeholders (facility user/customer, installation engineers,  and  operators),  project  architects/engineers,  interior  designers,  planners,  value engineers,  environmental  engineers,  energy  managers,  contracting  officers,  constructors,  and DA/CA-agents.  For NAF projects, the funding organization is also part of the team determining the execution strategy. AFI32-1023  19 NOVEMBER 2015 39 Quality Assurance—The Construction Agent’s review of all phases of the construction work to ascertain quality or state of work and to determine compliance with plans and specifications and contract provisions. Red  Zone  Meeting—A  meeting  held  at  the  80  percent  construction  completion  date  where participants  discuss,  define,  and  achieve  consensus  on  actions  necessary  to  complete construction,  support  user  occupancy,  perform  financial  closeout  and  document  the  fiscal closeout of the project in the Real Property Records. Ribbon  Cutter—Ribbon  Cutter  is  an  Air  Force  Military  Construction  (MILCON)  Program project  execution  evaluation  tool.    The  AFCEC/CF  Integration  Cell  developed  this  product  to evaluate how well the AF and its partners are achieving their goals to provide the Air Force with the  best  possible  facilities  on  time  and  within  budget.    Ribbon  Cutter  is  not  a  comprehensive metric  at  this  time  nor  does  it  collect  details  or  reasons  for  missed  goals  to  aid  additional evaluation.    However,  the  AF  expects  our  project  execution  teams  to  use  results  from  Ribbon Cutter as a basis for further review and process improvement. Value  Engineering—The systematic review by a multi-disciplined team to identify/analyze the most life-cycle cost effective options to reliably accomplish the programmed project intent at the lowest  life-cycle  cost  without  sacrificing  safety,  quality,  operations,  maintenance,  and  the environment.    The  experienced,  multi-disciplinary  team  improves  value  and  economy  through the  study  of  alternate  design  concepts,  materials,  and  methods  without  compromising  the project’s functional requirements.
