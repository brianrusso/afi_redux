Purpose.  This  AFI  provides  implementation  instructions  for  the  Risk  Management Framework (RMF) methodology for Air Force (AF)  Information  Technology (IT) according to AFPD 17-1, Information Dominance Governance and Management, and AFI 17-130, Air Force Cybersecurity Program Management, which is only one component of cybersecurity. 1.1.1.  The  RMF  incorporates  strategy,  policy,  awareness/training,  assessment,  continuous monitoring, authorization, implementation, and remediation. 1.1.2.  The  RMF  aligns  with  SAF/CIO  A6’s  AF  Information  Dominance  Flight  Plan  key concept  of  increasing  cybersecurity  of  AF  information  systems;  therefore,  robust  risk assessment and management is required. 1.1.3.  The RMF process encompasses life cycle risk management to determine and manage the residual cybersecurity risk to the AF created by the vulnerabilities and threats associated with objectives in military, intelligence, and business operations. 1.1.4.  Effective implementation and resultant residual risk associated with security controls implementation is assessed and mitigated, aligns with DoDI 8510.01, and as documented in the RMF security authorization package for AF IT. 1.1.5.  Discrete  classes  of  systems  (i.e.,  AF  financial  systems)  are  subject  to  additional requirements  contained  in  Attachment  3  to  this  document.    Guidance  contained  in Attachment 3 are intended to supplement, but not replace, the policy limits articulated in this Instruction. 1.2.  Applicability. 1.2.1.  This publication is binding on all military, civilian and contract employees, and other individuals  or  organizations  as  required  by  binding  agreement  or  obligation  with  the Department of the Air Force, who develop, acquire, deliver, use, operate, support, or manage AF IT.  This publication applies to all networked or standalone IT used to receive, process, store, display, or transmit AF information (or Government information where the AF agreed to  manage  the  information/infrastructure),  as  well  as  DoD  partnered  systems  where  it  is agreed that DoD standards are followed.  AF IT (see Figure 1.1) includes but is not limited to:    information  systems  (IS)  (major  applications  and  enclaves),  platform  information technology (PIT) (PIT systems, PIT subsystems, and PIT products), IT services (Internal  & External), and IT products (software, hardware, and applications). 1.2.2.  This  AFI  does  not  apply  to  the  protection  of  Sensitive  Compartmented  Information (SCI)  systems  or  intelligence,  surveillance,  reconnaissance  mission  and  mission  support systems or higher authoritative guidance governing Special Access Program (SAP) systems. 1.2.3.  Authority for AF space systems rests with AF Space Command (AFSPC) as delegated by  United  States  Strategic  Command  (USSTRATCOM).    AF  space  systems  follow  AF cybersecurity  policy  and  processes;  where  exceptions  exist,  this  Instruction  is  annotated accordingly.  NOTE:  Space systems supporting more than one DoD Component will follow 6 AFI17-101  2 FEBRUARY 2017 cybersecurity policy  and guidance in  DoDI 8581.01,  Information Assurance  (IA) Policy for Space Systems Used by the Department of Defense. 1.2.4.  For IT not centrally managed or has yet to be assigned an Authorizing Official (AO), the unit responsible for ownership or operation of the IT shall assign duties for the minimum RMF relevant roles (see Table 2.1) required to comply with RMF.  The duties shall include the roles and responsibilities for reporting, oversight, and risk management to the AF. Figure 1.1.  Air Force IT Categories.  1.3.  Objectives. 1.3.1.  The RMF replaces the DIACAP and manages the life-cycle cybersecurity risk to AF IT.  The RMF provides  a disciplined and structured process  to  perform AF  IT security and risk management activities and to integrate those activities into the system development life cycle.  The RMF changes the traditional focus of certification and accreditation (C&A) as a static,  procedural  activity  to  a  more  dynamic  approach  to  more  effectively  manage  mission and  cybersecurity  risks  in  diverse  environments  of  complex,  evolving,  and  sophisticated cyber threats and vulnerabilities. 1.3.2.  The  RMF  ensures  AF  IT  assets  are  assessed  for  cybersecurity  risk  to  the  AF,  the discovered  weaknesses  are  documented  in  a  plan  of  action  and  milestones  (POA&M)  to mitigate residual risk, and an AO, supported by the RMF team members, identified at Table 2.1,  accepts  the  risk  to  the  AO’s  area  of  responsibility,  IAW  AFPD  16-14,  Security Enterprise Governance, and DoDI 8510.01. AFI17-101  2 FEBRUARY 2017 7 Chapter 2 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.

Cybersecurity Forums.  The AF leverages existing DoD and AF governance bodies (e.g., Air Force Security Enterprise Executive Board (AFSEEB), Information Technology Governance Executive  Board  (ITGEB))  to  discuss  cybersecurity  risk  topics  and  make  organizational  and mission area risk decisions.  This Instruction does not define the scope or responsibilities of these existing  bodies.    The  following  forums  provide  focused  management  and  oversight  of  the  AF Cybersecurity Program. 2.22.1.  AF  Cybersecurity  Technical  Advisory  Group  (AFCTAG).    The  AFCTAG  provides technical  cybersecurity  subject  matter  experts  (SMEs)  from  across  the  MAJCOMs  and functional  communities  to  facilitate  the  management,  oversight,  and  execution  of  the  AF 18 AFI17-101  2 FEBRUARY 2017 Cybersecurity  Program.    The  AFCTAG  examines  cybersecurity-related  issues  common across AF  entities and provides recommendations to  the CISO and  DSAWG on changes  to the minimally required security controls (for AFIN connection) or configurations. 2.22.2.  Air Force Risk Management Council (AFRMC).  The AFRMC provides a forum for the senior cybersecurity professionals to discuss issues concerning cybersecurity risk from a mission and business  perspective. The council reviews proposed Mission  Area or AF RMF control  overlays,  and  RMF  guidance.   The  council  standardizes  the  cybersecurity implementation  processes  for  both  the  acquisition  and  lifecycle  operations  for  IT.    The AFRMC  advises  and  makes  recommendations  to  existing  governance  bodies.    Finally,  the AFRMC recommends assignment of IT to the appropriate AO for systems that fall outside of all defined authorization boundaries. 2.22.3.  AF AO Summit.  The AO Summit is not a governance body but rather an enabler for both  an  enterprise-wide  and  converged  organizational  perspective  to  cybersecurity  policy development, oversight, implementation, and training.  This venue provides the SAF/CIO A6 and AOs an opportunity to discuss issues relevant to the RMF, AO Boundaries, IT, AOs, and SCAs. 2.22.4.  For  additional  information  on  these  forums,  please  see  the  SAF/CIO  A6Z Cybersecurity Division site, AFI 17-130, applicable charters, and process guides. AFI17-101  2 FEBRUARY 2017 19 Chapter 3 RMF METHODOLOGY 3.1.  Overview. 3.1.1.  The  6-Step  RMF  process  at  RMF  Tier  3  (system  level)  is  based  on  the  process outlined  in  NIST  SP  800-37r1  and  DoDI  8510.01  and  is  illustrated  in  Figure  3.1.    Where possible,  this  Instruction  also  identifies  steps  required  for  the  “Assess  Only”  process.    This process  is  iterative  throughout  the  entire  lifecycle  for  IT  IAW  DoDI  5000.02  and  the  DoD Program  Manager’s  Guidebook  for  Integrating  the  Cybersecurity  Risk  Management Framework (RMF) into the System Acquisition Lifecycle (DoD PM Guidebook). 3.1.2.  The DoD RMF KS is the authoritative source for RMF implementation, planning, and execution. 3.1.3.  This  chapter  highlights  the  AF-specific  implementation,  key  AF  roles  in  each  step, and additional resources required to complete the process.  This Instruction is intended to be a companion to the DoD implementation instructions.  Specific implementation guidance is available  on  the  DoD  RMF  KS.    Additionally,  supplementary  guidance  concerning  the execution  of  RMF  steps  for  discrete  classes  of  AF  systems  (e.g.,  financial  systems)  is contained in the Attachments. Figure 3.1.  RMF for AF IT. 3.2.  RMF Step 1, CATEGORIZE System.  References DoDI 8510.01, CNSSI No.1253, NIST SP  800-53r4,  NIST  SP  800-60,  Guide  for  Mapping  Types  of  Information  and  Information Systems to Security Categories, and the DoD RMF KS.  20 AFI17-101  2 FEBRUARY 2017 3.2.1.  Begin this step by completing the RMF IT Categorization and Selection Checklist and DD  Form  2930,  Privacy  Impact  Assessment.  During  categorization,  the  impact  to confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility is categorized into one of three designations (low, moderate,  or  high)  to  address  the  impact  of  a  loss.  If  the  program’s  primary  mission  is  not represented on the form’s Authorization Boundary list, the PM or ISO will check “other” on the  IT  Categorization  Checklist  and  submit  the  completed  document  to  the  AFRMC  for disposition;  send  to  SAF/CIO  A6ZC  Cybersecurity  Division,  usaf.pentagon.saf-cio-a6.mbx.a6sc-workflow@mail.mil.    SAF/CIO  A6ZC  retains  the  IT  categorized  as  “other” until  the  new  AO  Authorization  Boundary  is  created  or  an  AO  is  assigned.    If  an  existing boundary is determined, the Checklist is returned to the PM/ISO for staffing to and approval by the determined AOs. 3.2.2.  Each AF IT,  IAW AFI 17-110, must be registered in EITDR, as the governance tool for  the  AF  CIO,  with  the  exception  of  those  identified  by  other  policy  (i.e.,  space,  Nuclear Command, Control, and Communication (NC3), Joint) to be registered in another repository.  (T-1)  EITDR/ITIPS  will  systematically  assign  a  temporary  registration  number  for  each registered  IT  until  the  next  scheduled  replication  with  DoD  Information  Technology Portfolio  Repository  (DITPR).    A  DITPR  number  will  then  be  systematically  assigned  and included in EITDR/ITIPS as the permanent official IT registration number  for all registered AF IT. NOTE: The EITDR system is transitioning to ITIPS by the end of 2nd quarter of 2017.  When this system, or any future tracking system, is implemented, the EITDR registration requirements still apply in the current tracking system.  All instances within this Instruction that reference EITDR is equivalent to ITIPS; consider these names interchangeable. 3.2.3.  PMs or ISOs deploying systems across DoD/AF Components will register the system and  post  the  categorization  checklist  to  Enterprise  Mission  Assurance  Support  Service (eMASS). 3.2.4.  For  programs  where  the  sensitivity  of  information  may  present  a  cybersecurity concern,  the  program  (e.g.,  Aircraft,  C2,  and  Weapons  Systems)  is  required  to  upload  only the following information/documentation into eMASS:  PM and System Information eMASS fields,  IT  Categorization  and  Selection  Checklist  document,  Cybersecurity  Strategy document,  Authorization  Decision  Memo  document,  and  a  Statement  in  the  POA&M comments  section (eMASS field) indicating  the number of POA&M entries for the system. All  documentation  will  be  regularly  reviewed  to  ensure  accuracy  and  completeness,  which may be audited by SAF/CIO A6ZC, Cybersecurity, the AO, or the SCA at any time. 3.2.5.  Register  all  IT  in  the  appropriate  eMASS  instance:    NIPRNet  eMASS  or  SIPRNet eMASS.    Both  instances  have  the  same  capabilities.    Please  note,  SIPRNet  eMASS  is  not certified  to  store  TOP  SECRET,  SCI,  or  SAP/SAR  artifacts  or  implementation  details. NIPRNet eMASS is not certified to store SECRET artifacts or implementation details.  The assigned  SCA  protects  artifacts  with  special  handling  requirements.    In  those  cases,  the implementation  plan  or  test  results  should  simply  state  a  0  level  (Compliant  or  Non-Compliant) and a reference to where the associated artifacts can be located. 3.2.6.  The  organization’s  eMASS  Account  Manager  grants  access  to  eMASS  and  grants required permissions based on duties and responsibilities.  A listing of Account Managers for the AF organizations can be found on the SAF/CIO A6ZC Cybersecurity eMASS site. AFI17-101  2 FEBRUARY 2017 21 3.3.  RMF  Step  2,  SELECT  Security  Controls.

The security control baseline is selected based on the IT categorization. 3.3.4.  Identify and apply overlays that apply to the AF IT. See Chapter 5. 3.3.5.  Tailor controls as required. Every selected control must be accounted for either by the organization or the ISO.  If a control is added or de-selected from the baseline (i.e., tagged as not  applicable),  then  a  risk-based  rationale  must  be  documented  in  the  security  plan  and POA&M.    Also,  if  a  selected  control  will  not  be  implemented,  document  a  risk-informed rationale (i.e., using a cost/benefit analysis) for not  planning to  implement  the control must be documented in the security plan and POA&M. 3.3.6.  Operational  Technology  (OT)  is  more  sensitive  to  the  application  of  cyber  security measures and controls that can affect its availability.  Many forms of OT are categorized as types  of  PIT  systems,  PIT  subsystems,  or  PIT  products.    An  AO  with  OT  within  their authorization boundary is responsible for managing the risk for OT and may tailor controls to balance security and availability. 3.3.7.  ISCM  strategy.    Develop  and  document  a  system-level  ISCM  strategy  for  the continuous monitoring of the effectiveness of security controls employed within or inherited by  the  system,  and  monitoring  of  any  proposed  or  actual  changes  to  the  system  and  its environment of operation. 22 AFI17-101  2 FEBRUARY 2017 3.3.8.

Use  DoDI  8510.01, enclosure 6 instructions for details for assessing security controls. 3.6.  RMF  Step  5,  AUTHORIZE  System.  After  reviewing  the  security  authorization documentation, the AO formally accepts or rejects risk by authorizing the IT through an IATT, ATO, ATO with conditions, or a DATO.  References DoDI 8510.01, enclosure 6. 3.6.1.  AOs may issue an IATT, ATO, or an ATO with conditions for any risk determined not to be “Very High” or “High”. (T-0) 3.6.2.  ATO with conditions for unmitigated “Very High” or “High” risk. 3.6.2.1.  The  SAF/CIO  A6  is  the  only  Air  Force  member  who  may  grant  IT  to  operate (receive an ATO with conditions) with “Very High” or “High” risk (formerly known as CAT  I)  non-compliant  security  controls  that  cannot  be  corrected  or  mitigated immediately, but where the overall risk is  acceptable.  Delegation below  the AF CIO is not authorized.  IT with “Very High” or “High” risk, which are authorized by other DoD Components  connecting  to  the  AFIN  require  their  Component  CIO  approval,  and  joint systems require DoD CIO approval. 3.6.2.2.  IT with unmitigated “Very High” or “High” risk non-compliant security controls must  follow  the  Very  High/High  Package  Submission  Guide  and  submit  completed packages  to  the  SAF/CIO  A6  for  approval  prior  to  making  an  authorization  decision.    (T-0)    AFI17-101  2 FEBRUARY 2017 23 3.6.2.3.  For “Very High” or “High” risk authorizations, the ATO with conditions can be issued  for  up  to  1  year.    When  a  1-year  ATO  with  conditions  is  issued,  the  ATO  with conditions  specifies  a  review  period  that  is  within  6  months  of  the  authorization termination date (ATD).  (T-1) 3.6.2.4.  If  the  system  still  requires  operation  with  a  level  of  risk  of  “Very  High”  or “High” after 1 year, the AF CIO must again grant permission for continued operation of the system. (T-0) 3.7.  Denial of Authorization to Operate (DATO). 3.7.1.  If  risk  is  determined  to  be  unacceptable  when  compared  to  the  mission  assurance requirement,  then  the  AO,  in  collaboration  with  all  program  stakeholders,  will  issue  the authorization  decision  in  the  form  of  a  DATO.    If  the  system  is  already  operational,  the responsible  AO  will  issue  a  DATO  and  operation  of  the  system  will  cease  immediately.  Network connections will be immediately terminated for any system that is issued a DATO. 3.7.2.  Upon  issuing  the  DATO,  the  AO  will  provide  a  copy  of  the  issued  document  to SAF/CIO A6 via usaf.pentagon.saf-cio-a6.mbx.a6sc-workflow@mail.mil. 3.8.  RMF  Step  6,  MONITOR  Security  Controls.  References  DoDI  8510.01  and  NIST  SP 800-137, Information Security Continuous Monitoring (ISCM). 3.8.1.  DoDI 8510.01 and the DoD RMF KS for Continuous Monitoring provides a detailed framework  on  continuous  monitoring,  which  should  be  used  to  augment  the  continuous monitoring program for the IT. 3.8.2.  If  a  system-level  ISCM  strategy  is  not  yet  developed  or  executed,  as  a  minimum, periodically  assess  a  subset  of  the  selected  controls  using  a  team  (e.g.,  ISSM,  sys  admin, CSSP, PM, ISO) to ensure any changes are immediately addressed the impact to the system, mission,  and  capabilities  are  determined.  The  periodic  assessment  is  documented  in  the security  assessment  report  (SAR).    The  PM  updates  the  POA&M  and  security  plan documents with the new vulnerabilities. 3.8.3.  Following  the  issuance  of  the  authorization  decision  and  establishment  of  a  security baseline (i.e., ATO or ATO with conditions), any changes to the system must be assessed by the system’s ISSM to ascertain if the change has a security impact.  The ISSM is critical in the  initiation  of  the  change  review  process.    The  ISSM  must  consult  the  SCA  for  an assessment of any change to the system to determine if re-authorization is required.  The rule of  thumb  is  that  if  the  implementation  of  a  security  control  is  affected  by  the  change (especially for IA or IA-enabled products), there must be a validation of the security control implementation,  as  in  the  initial  assessment  effort.    Therefore,  the  authorization  is  at jeopardy,  and  the  SCA  must  assess  the  implementation  and  assessment  of  the  security control/s and determine if the risk level remains consistent with the current authorization. 3.8.4.  If  the  ISSM  determines  the  system  change  does  not  adversely  affect  the  security baseline  of  the  system  (i.e.,  no  security  impact  (NSI)),  the  system  may  continue  to  operate under  its  current  authorization  decision.    Changes  are  documented  and  included  with  the system security documentation and RMF documentation.  The ISSM must provide a synopsis of  the  NSI  to  the  SCA  for  concurrence.    If  the  SCA  concurs  with  the  NSI,  a  new authorization decision and connection approval is not required. 24 AFI17-101  2 FEBRUARY 2017 3.8.5.  If the ISSM determines a change impacts the security baseline of the system, the SCA must  evaluate  the  change  and  determine  the  appropriate  course  of  action;  that  is,  the  SCA could direct use of an independent validator (i.e., an ASCA) for hands-on evaluation of the system.  If the SCA concurs the change impacts the security baseline of the system, and/or a weakness cannot be mitigated in a timely manner to bring the risk back to the level the AO accepted in the current authorization, a new authorization decision and connection approval is  required.    NOTE:    If  the  change  results  in  a  new  “Very  High”  or  “High”  risk  non-compliant  security  control(s)  that  can  be  corrected  within  30  days  or  a  new  Moderate  risk that  can  be  corrected/satisfactorily  mitigated  within  90  days,  the  system  can  continue  to operate  under  the  existing  authorization  decision  and  connection  approval  as  referenced  in DoDI 8510.01. 3.9.  Resources and Tools. 3.9.1.  DoD  PM  Guidebook.  The  DoD  Program  Manager's  Guidebook  for  Integrating  the Cybersecurity  Risk  Management  Framework  (RMF)  into  the  System  Acquisition  Lifecycle, The DoD PM Guidebook supports the policies in this AFI by providing specific procedures and is capable of implementing changes as industry and policy dictate. (T-0) 3.9.2.  PIT  Cybersecurity  Guidebook.  The  Platform  Information  Technology  (PIT) Cybersecurity  Guidebook  provides  clarity  on  the  information  cybersecurity  activities required  for  all  PIT.    This  includes  weapon  systems,  medical  systems,  industrial  control systems, armament systems, test systems, etc., that qualify as PIT.  The Guidebook should be used to develop local procedures, as enhancement to RMF for PIT that correspond with the product being developed or procured.  The Guidebook suggests best practices to be followed in  ensuring  cybersecurity  is  “built-in”  to  the  product,  but  allows  local  variations.    The primary  use  of  the  Guidebook  is  for  acquisition  of  new  PIT  and  to  provide  guidance  on applicability of the RMF to legacy PIT. 3.9.3.  ASCA  Licensing  Guide.    The number and complexity of AF  IT may  require the AF SCA to  designate qualified entities as ASCA to  perform assessment  actions.  The AF SCA created the ASCA Licensing Guide to appoint licensed, qualified agents to provide accurate, consistent, and trusted AF and Space IT assessments. 3.9.4.  Plan of Actions and Milestones (POA&M). 3.9.4.1.  The  IT  security  POA&M  is  a  tool  that  identifies  tasks  that  need  to  be accomplished  to  mitigate  systems  weaknesses  and  reduce  risk.    It  details  resources required to accomplish the elements of the plan, any milestones in meeting the task, and scheduled completion dates for the milestones.  The purpose of the POA&M is to assist agencies in identifying, assessing, prioritizing, and monitoring the progress of corrective efforts  for  security  weaknesses  found  in  IT.    For  further  POA&M  information,  refer  to the Air Force POA&M Guidebook. 3.9.4.2.  SAF/CIO A6ZC will monitor and track the overall execution of system-level IT security  POA&Ms  (on  behalf  of  the  AF  CIO  and  CISO)  until  identified  security weaknesses are closed and the RMF documentation appropriately adjusted.  (T-0) 3.9.4.3.  The PM or ISO is responsible for implementing the corrective actions identified in  the  IT  security  POA&M    and,  with  the  support  and  assistance  of  the  ISSM,  will provide visibility and status to the ISO, AO, and the AF CIO.  (T-0) AFI17-101  2 FEBRUARY 2017 25 Chapter 4 APPROVAL TO CONNECT (ATC) PROCESS 4.1.  Overview.  The  ATC  process  is  one  instance  of  the  AF’s  implementation  of  reciprocity between  AOs.    It  is  a  formal  evaluation  of  the  risk  of  connecting  systems  to  the  receiving enclave;  the  ATC  is  a  means  to  manage  community  risk.    Having  an  ATO  does  not  entitle systems to an ATC from the receiving AO. NOTE: Although this Instruction specifies the requirements for connections to the AFIN, other AOs are encouraged to utilize this process to authorize connections to enclaves within their authorization (formerly accreditation) boundary. 4.2.  Duration and Expiration.  In order for a system to request an ATC from a site or enclave, both the AF system and the destination enclave must have a valid and current authorization.  The system  ATC  expiration date  will  be  no  later  than  the  ATD  of  the  ATO  for  that  system.    For  a system under continual reauthorization, the connection authorization must be reevaluated upon a significant system modification, significant change to the threat or risk posture, or every 3 years, whichever comes first. 4.3.  Connection to the DoDIN.  For enclaves requiring a circuit connection from DISA, ISSMs must follow the DISN Connection Process Guide to ensure all required artifacts are provided on initial submission.  Connection requests will be coordinated through the AF Enterprise AO. 4.4.  Connection  to  the  Air  Force  Information  Networks  (AFIN).  The AF Enterprise AO is the only authority permitted to grant an ATC to the AFIN.  The Enterprise AO may delegate this authority to appropriate representatives with concurrence of the SAF/CIO A6. 4.4.1.  AF systems authorized through the AF  Enterprise  AO will  receive an  ATC after the system  is  reviewed  for  compliance  with  the  required  security  controls  and  the  community risk imposed by the connecting system is determined to be at an acceptable level. 4.4.2.  AF systems authorized through another AF AO will submit the ATC request through eMASS. 4.4.3.  Non-AF owned systems with approved authorizations (i.e., "Guest System", see para 4.5) are required to have an ATC request initiated in eMASS by the AF sponsor, the PM, or ISO before the IT connects to the AFIN. 4.4.4.  The AF Enterprise SCA will identify and maintain a listing of the Tier I/II (common) security controls on the  RMF KS,  Air Force Component Workspace.   Furthermore, the  AF Enterprise  SCA  will  specify  continuous  monitoring  requirements  for  each  of  the  identified common controls.  (T-0) 4.4.5.  Certain  security  controls  are  designated  as  required  (to  address  community  risk concerns)  of  all  systems  requesting  a  connection  to  the  AFIN.    Some  of  these  required controls  may  be  inherited  from  the  Tier  1/II  Common  security  controls.    Required  controls may not be tailored out during the security control selection or tailoring steps.  Regardless of the  source  (i.e.,  Tier  I/II  inherited  or  provide  by  the  system),  a  status  of  “Compliant”  or “Non-Compliant”  is  required  for  each  of  these  controls.    The  assessment  of  these  controls and associated artifacts will determine whether the AF system poses an unacceptable risk to 26 AFI17-101  2 FEBRUARY 2017 the AFIN or other systems  connected to or residing on the AFIN (i.e., imposes community risk).  Furthermore, the AF Enterprise SCA will specify continuous monitoring requirements for each of the identified required controls. 4.4.6.  The AF Enterprise AO will document the ATC decision in eMASS. (T-1) 4.5.  Guest  System  Registration.  A  special  case,  limited  registration  of  a  system  that  is authorized by a non-AF Authorizing Official, or is owned by a non-Air Force organization but is hosted within the AFIN. 4.5.1.  IT usaf.pentagon.saf-cio-a6.mbx.a6sc-workflow@mail.mil. identified  as  a  Guest  System  must the  name  of the  AF  sponsor to 4.5.2.  Provide  the  following  information  in  your  request:    System  acronym,  system  name, brief system description, ATD, and organization that granted the authorization.  If possible, identify the AF community which will use the system and a recommended sponsor. 4.5.3.  The appointed sponsor is  documented in  a sponsorship  memo prepared by SAF/CIO A6.    The  AF  sponsor  will  then  enter  the  system  into  eMASS  and  act  as  a  liaison  with  the external  customer.    Systems  authorized  by  another  AO  are  required,  as  a  minimum,  to provide a topology and valid authorization for the system being connected.  Additionally, the following  RMF  artifacts  or  other  equivalent  are  required:  Sponsor  memo;  authorization decision;  port,  protocol,  and  services  (PPS)  listing;  hardware/software  list;  SAR;  and POA&M.    Additionally,  space  systems  identified  as  AF  IT  investments  must  register  in EITDR/ITIPS.  (T-1) 4.6.  ATC Process for Air Force Functional/Mission Systems. 4.6.1.  AF  functional/mission  systems  (e.g.,  A4,  SAF/FM,  PMOs)  systems  with  an  AF Authorization to Operate (ATO), Interim Authorization to Test (IATT), or Authorization to Operate  (ATO)  with  conditions  signed  by  an  AF  AO  (other  than  the  AF  Enterprise  AO) require an ATC to the AFIN. 4.6.2.  The Functional/Mission System PM or AO Staff is responsible for submitting requests for  obtaining  an  ATC  from  the  AF  Enterprise  AO.    For  systems/enclaves  connecting to/through the AFIN, ATC  requests are submitted to  the AF Enterprise AO in  eMASS as a “Guest  System”.    For  systems/enclaves  connecting  to/through  the  AFNET  or  AFNET-S, ATC  requests  are  submitted  to  the  AF  Enterprise  AO  through  “Manage  ATC”  function  in eMASS.  Contact  the  AF  Enterprise  AO  staff  for  other  connection  (contractor,  commercial Internet service provider, direct) AO’s POC for information and guidance. 4.7.  Continuous Monitoring.  AF IT ISSMs must ensure the controls identified as required for an ATC are monitored IAW the published continuous monitoring strategy guidance.  The details will be included in the system-level ISCM strategy and evaluated and approved by the receiving AO.    (T-0)    If  the  system  fails  to  meet  the  continuous  monitoring  requirements,  a  Denial  of Approval to Connect (DATC) may be issued. 4.8.  Denial of Approval to Connect (DATC).  A DATC may be issued for any IT (connected to  the  AFIN  or  other  AF  enclave)  at  any  time,  if  the  AO  determines  the  risk  to  the  receiving enclave is too high.  The PM or ISO is notified immediately of the DATC.   AFI17-101  2 FEBRUARY 2017 27 4.8.1.  If the system is already connected, the connection must be terminated upon signature of the DATC. 4.8.2.  All  denial  decisions  must  be  signed  by  the  hosting  enclave  AO,  and  cannot  be delegated further. 28 AFI17-101  2 FEBRUARY 2017 Chapter 5 SECURITY CONTROL OVERLAYS 5.1.  Overview.  Overlays provide communities of interest an opportunity for consistent tailoring of  security  controls  based  on  risk  specific  to  a  type  of  information,  system,  or  environment.  They  include  characteristics  and  assumptions  about  the  overlay  topic,  security  control  and control  enhancement  specifications,  risk-based  rationale  for  control  specifications  (tied  back  to the  characteristics/assumptions)  supplemental  guidance,  and  tailoring  guidance  designed  to refine the control selection and tailoring process. 5.2.  Policy.  The  DoD  may  vet  all  AF  overlays  for  consideration  as  a  DoD  or  CNSS  overlay.  The cognizant authorities over the type of information, system, or environment that is the subject of the overlay and who are principally impacted by the use of a proposed overlay will (with the support and  concurrence of  all affected parties)  generate and approve overlays.   The AF  CISO will approve overlays that have AF-wide impact. 5.3.  Development  and  Approval  Process.  Follow  the  process  outlined  in  the  AF  Approved Overlay Process to develop and approve overlays for use on AF IT. 5.3.1.  Send topic to AF Cybersecurity TAG Chairs.  (OPR: Overlay Proposer)  All potential topics for overlays are submitted to the AF Cybersecurity TAG Chairs for validation.  Topics should  be  sent  to  usaf.pentagon.saf-cio-a6.mbx.a6sc-workflow@mail.mil.    The  topics should  include  the  following  information:  Name  of  proposed  overlay;  use  case  for  overlay application;  summary  of  the  unique  characteristics  that  drive  the  need  to  tailor  controls; applicable laws, regulations, or directives governing the application of the overlay; and point of contact information. 5.3.2.  Validate  Topic.  (OPR:  AF  Cybersecurity  TAG)    The  TAG  Chairs  will  provide  the proposed  overlay  information  to  TAG  members  for  an  electronic  vote.    The  TAG  will consider  whether  the  proposed  overlay  is  relevant  to  AF  IT,  as  well  as  ensure  there  are  no conflicts  with  overlays  in  development,  approved,  or  disapproved  previously.    Adjustments to the topic may be made in coordination with the overlay proposer. 5.3.3.  Follow AF Overlay Development and Approval Process.  (OPR: Overlay Proposer)  If approved,  the  Overlay  Development  Team  will  follow  the  approved  AF  Overlay Development and Approval Process.  The overlay development team should coordinate with SAF/CIO A6ZC, Cybersecurity Division, throughout the development process. 5.3.4.  Support  Overlay  Development.    (OPR:  Overlay  Proposer/  Overlay  Development Team;  OCR:  SAF/CIO  A6,  Cybersecurity)    The  Overlay  Proposer  is  responsible  for identifying  an  Overlay  Development  Team the  overlay  and  supporting documentation.    SAF/CIO  A6ZC,  Cybersecurity  Division,  can  assist  with  the  policy requirements for the overlay. to  build 5.3.5.  Develop  Overlay.    (OPR:  Overlay  Proposer,  Overlay  Development  Team,  OCR: ISSM, AF CISO)  Use the template provided in CNSSI No. 1253, Appendix F, Attachment 2 to develop the overlay.  In addition to the specified controls, the Overlay Development Team must  include  any  adjustments  to  implementation  guidance,  assessment  procedures,  and specific  assignment  values  for  the  selected  controls.    The  tailoring  guidance  must  clearly AFI17-101  2 FEBRUARY 2017 29 state any limitations or restrictions to guide application of the overlay.  All security control specifications must be justified based on the risk specific to the type of information, system, or  environment  that  is  the  topic  of  the  overlay,  and  that  risk  must  trace  back  to  a characteristic and/or assumption clearly stated in the front matter of the overlay. 5.4.  Review and Coordinate Finalized Overlay. 5.4.1.  (OPR:  SAF/CIO  A6ZC,  Cybersecurity  Division)  When the Overlay  Development Team  is  completed  required  actions,  the  overlay  and  overlay  approval  memorandum  is provided to SAF/CIO A6ZC for review and posting, as applicable (mission system use, AF or  other  use,  and  dissemination).    SAF/CIO  A6ZC  will  review  the  selected  controls, implementation  guidance,  assessment  procedures,  specific  assignment  values,  and  tailoring guidance for compliance with the CNSSI No. 1253 format.  If there are discrepancies in the overlay, the submitting organization must address those prior to gaining final approval. 5.4.2.  (OPR:  Overlay  proposer)  Overlays  are  developed  to  address  risks  specific  to  the type  of  information,  system,  or  environment;  therefore,  as  the  risk  changes  so  should  the overlay. Ensure review and modification of the overlay are captured in the security plan and other applicable documentation. 5.5.  Coordinate  with  DISA  to  Implement  Overlay  in  eMASS.  (OPR:  SAF/CIO  A6, Cybersecurity)    SAF/CIO  A6ZC,  Cybersecurity  Division,  will  coordinate  with  DISA  to implement the approved overlay in the NIPRNet and SIPRNet instances of eMASS.  Restrictions on use approved by the Mission Area Owner will be communicated to DISA. 30 AFI17-101  2 FEBRUARY 2017 Chapter 6 TRANSFER OF IT BETWEEN AUTHORIZING OFFICIALS 6.1.  Overview.  Every  IT  system  must  be  properly  aligned  to  an  AO.    (T-1)  The  overall objective is to ensure the transition process is standard and consistent.  The transition process is defined  as  the  transfer  of  IT  to  include  documentation  from  one  AO  to  another  AO.    It  is  a collaborative process executed by the owning AO and coordinated with the receiving AO.  The Request Transfer of Information Technology to Another Authorizing Official form (available on the AF RMF KS) will be used to facilitate an orderly and timely transfer of IT.  Transferring IT, projected  transfer  dates,  and  system  transfer  preconditions  will  be  coordinated  with  the applicable  AOs  and   The  AOs  will  ensure  process  accountability  and situational/stakeholder awareness throughout this process. their  staffs. 6.2.  Transition Process.  The transition process steps are as follows: 6.2.1.  The  owning  AO  staff,  in  coordination  with  the  PM  or  ISO,  if  no  PM  is  assigned, identifies the IT to transfer from an owning AO to the receiving AO. 6.2.2.  As  the  AO  staff  identifies  IT  for  transfer,  it  is  important  to  include  the  MAJCOM Portfolio Manager (PfM) of the IT in this identification process, as the PfM has an integral role in all IT transfer actions. 6.2.3.  The owning AO reviews and approves the proposed IT to transfer to the receiving AO. 6.2.4.  The PM or ISO of the IT completes the Request Transfer of Information Technology to Another Authorizing Official Form for each IT. 6.2.5.  The  owning  AO  staff,  in  coordination  with  the  PM/ISO  and  PfM,  contacts  the receiving AO staff/PM to discuss the proposed IT transfer. 6.2.6.  The receiving AO staff completes the Assessment/Notes section of Request  Transfer of Information Technology to Another Authorizing Official Form. 6.2.7.  The owning AO and receiving AO agree to the transfer (skip to 6.2.9). 6.2.8.  If  the  receiving  AO  disagrees  with  the  transfer,  the  owning  AO  staff  will  request assistance from the AFRMC by sending the Request Transfer of Information Technology to Another Authorizing Official Form to SAF-CIO A6ZC workflow at  usaf.pentagon.saf-cio-a6.mbx.a6sc-workflow@mail.mil.    The  AFRMC  will  adjudicate  the  inclusion/transfer  of the IT and provide a recommendation to the CISO as the final decision authority. 6.2.9.  Once the IT transfer is agreed to by both AOs, the owning AO and receiving AO sign the Request Transfer of Information Technology to Another Authorizing Official Form. 6.2.10.  The  PM/ISO,  in  coordination  with  the  PfM,  will  make  required  changes  in EITDR/ITIPS and eMASS. 6.3.  IT  With  No  AO  Assigned.  Systems  not  currently  under  any  AO’s  authority,  not  fitting into an authorization boundary, or not accepted by the gaining AO are addressed by the AFRMC.  If  the  IT  Categorization  and  Selection  Checklist  identifies  the  IT  should  be  assigned  in  the “other” AO Authorization Boundary, then SAF/CIO A6ZC, Cybersecurity Division,  retains the IT  until  the  new  AO  Authorization  Boundary  is  created  and  an  AO  is  assigned.    If  an  existing AFI17-101  2 FEBRUARY 2017 31 boundary is  determined,  the submitted  IT Categorization and Selection Checklist  is  returned to the PM/ISO for staffing to and approval by the determined AO. 32 AFI17-101  2 FEBRUARY 2017 Chapter 7 RMF TRANSITION 7.1.  Overview.  All IT will transition to the RMF IAW DoDI 8510.01.  In addition, the PM or ISO  will  ensure  all  IT  is  in  compliance  with  the  timelines  specified  below.    These  timelines provide  the  latest  date  a  DIACAP  package  may  be  submitted  for  C&A  and  provide  RMF submission  guidance.    The  RMF  timeline  does  not  prevent  a  PM  or  ISO  from  moving  to  the RMF sooner than the times specified below.  New and existing systems utilizing a contract shall include  contract  language  ensuring  the  IT  complies  with  the  RMF,  which  may  require modification  to  the  contract  language.    Acquisition  requirement  officials  shall  ensure  new requirements/systems are compliant with this Instruction and existing systems must be modified to utilize the RMF by the dates below. 7.2.  Transition Timeline. 7.2.1.  AOs  will  establish  transition  timelines  for  all  AF  IT  (new  and  existing)  within  their purview. 7.2.2.  PMs or ISOs may submit completed DIACAP packages to the AO for signature until 1 March 2017 (AF specific deadline), and the ATD is determined by the AO signature date, but  no  DIACAP  authorization  may  exceed  31  March  2018  without  an  approved  RMF Deviation Request. 7.2.3.  All packages submitted after 1 March 2017 (AF specific deadline) must comply with RMF policy and guidance (i.e., be in the format of the RMF security authorization package). 7.3.  RMF Deviation Requests. 7.3.1.  In the case of a significant financial or operational impact  due to transitioning to the RMF, an AO may submit a request for deviation to the SAF/CIO A6 for approval. 7.3.2.  Requests for deviation must include an RMF transition plan and a POA&M. 7.3.3.  Requests  are  submitted  to  SAF/CIO  A6ZC  Cybersecurity,  usaf.pentagon.saf-cio-a6.mbx.a6sc-workflow@mail.mil,  for  coordination  by  the  CISO  and  approval  by  the SAF/CIO A6. 7.3.4.  An approved deviation request does not relieve the IT from maintaining an acceptable risk posture.  WILLIAM J.

Any exceptions are defined below. Agent  of  the  Security  Control  Assessor—The licensed person or organization that acts  as an independent trusted agent of the SCA, providing fact-based security analysis. Approval  to  Connect—The  official  management  decision  given  by  a  senior  organizational official to authorize connection of an information system to an enclave and to explicitly accept the  risk  to  organizational  operations  (including  mission,  functions,  image,  or  reputation), organizational  assets, the implementation of an agreed-upon set of security controls. individuals,  other  organizations,  and the  Nation  based  on Guest  System—A special case, limited registration of a system that is authorized by a non-AF Authorizing Official, or is owned by a non-Air Force organization but is hosted within the AFIN and must complete the process to acquire an approval to connect (ATC) from the AF Enterprise AO. A Guest System is a type of external information system (see CNSSI No. 4009). AFI17-101  2 FEBRUARY 2017 39 Functional  System—A  system  with  a  mission-unique  function  usually  authorized  by  an  AO other  than  the  AF  Enterprise  AO  (e.g.,  Global  Command  and  Control  System  (GCCS),  Global Decisions Support System (GDSS)) Operational  Technology  (OT)—IT  adapted  to  directly  monitor  and  control  physical  devices, processes, and events where availability is the primary operational concern. PIT Subsystem—A collection of PIT that does not rise to the level of a PIT system. PIT  Product—Individual  hardware  or  software  components,  including,  but  not  limited  to, operating  systems,  commercial  or  government  software,  or  individual  hardware  that  support specific mission functionality.  IT Products, when purposed for PIT, become PIT Products.  40 AFI17-101  2 FEBRUARY 2017 Attachment 2 AF IT ASSESS ONLY REQUIREMENTS 1.  PIT Subsystems, PIT Products, IT Services, and IT Products. IT categorized below the system level will not require an authorization decision.  These IT will follow the Assess Only process.  The IT below the system level must be securely configured (in accordance with applicable DoD policies and security controls), documented in an assessment package, and reviewed by the responsible ISSM, under the direction of the AO, for acceptance or connection into an authorized IS or PIT System. 1.1.  PIT.  The PIT system owner (i.e., ISO) may determine that a collection of PIT rises to the level of a PIT System with the AO’s approval. The ISSM (with the review and approval of the AO) is responsible for ensuring all PIT complete the appropriate RMF processes prior to incorporation into or connection to a system or enclave.  PIT may be categorized using CNSSI No. 1253 with the resultant security control baselines tailored as needed.  Otherwise, the specific cybersecurity needs of PIT must be assessed on a case-by-case basis and security controls applied as appropriate. 1.2.  IT Services.  Organizations that use internal IT services must ensure the categorization of the system delivering the service is appropriate to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability needs of the information and mission and that written agreements describing the roles and responsibilities of both the provider and the recipient are in place.  Organizations that use external IT services provided by a non-DoD federal government agency, except cloud services, must ensure the categorization of the system delivering the service is appropriate to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability needs of the information and mission, and that the system delivering the service is operating under a current authorization from that agency. Organizations contracting for external IT services in the form of commercial cloud computing services must comply with DoD and AF cloud computing policy and procedural guidance. 1.3.  IT Products.  Products will be configured by the system administrator in accordance with applicable STIGs under a cognizant ISSM and SCA.  STIGs are product specific and document applicable DoD policies and security requirements, as well as best practices and configuration guidelines.  When a STIG is not available for a product, a Security Requirements Guide (SRG) may be used. 1.4.  IT Product, Software, and Application Certification Assessment. ISSMs have the responsibility to exercise due diligence on IT product software and applications (software products) that reside on their enclave/system.  At a minimum, software products will be assessed for supportability, operability, compatibility, and security to ensure the products present an acceptable risk to the AFIN.  This can be accomplished via the following methods: 1.4.1.  Assess and Authorize. ISSM’s may incorporate software assessment and evaluation, giving the Software Assessment Report (SwAR) as part of their system enclave’s security authorization package.  Follow the guidance and use the template on the DoD RMF KS.   1.4.2.  Air Force Software and Application Certification Assessment (AF SACA). Software products may be assessed through the AF SACA process managed by the Air Force Network Integration Center (AFNIC).  The Enterprise SCA then certifies software products for inclusion on the AF Evaluated Products List (AF EPL).  Testing may be accomplished by AFNIC or by the organization sponsoring the software product.  Software products are certified for use on computers running the Standard Desktop Configuration or DoD Server Core Configuration, AFI17-101  2 FEBRUARY 2017 41 applications, and approved mobile devices on the AFIN.  Instructions, templates, and the testing methodology are located on the Software Certification Assessment home page. 1.4.2.1.  All assessments must be initiated and documented using an Application Request Worksheet (ARW).  The ARW will be submitted and endorsed by the Wing ISSM or MAJCOM functional directorate. 1.4.2.2.  Once the ARW is accepted by AFNIC, testing is accomplished by either the sponsor or AFNIC.  The software assessment must be conducted on an environment external to the operational network. 1.4.2.3.  If the software product presents an acceptable risk (e.g., low or very low) to the enclave, the major version of the product will be certified for up to 3 years by the AF Enterprise SCA and placed on the AF EPL. This certification is not an ATO.  The system or enclave ISSM must implement any required mitigations to reduce the risk before placing the software product within the system or enclave.  The ISSM must update the applicable system or enclave assessment and authorization documentation and hardware/software lists to reflect any solutions implemented.  This update will be considered a “no security impact” modification to the system authorization. 2.  Reciprocity. For products not already assessed via the RMF or the AF SACA process, the Enterprise AO allows ISSMs to use software products that are certified by another DoD AO or SCA. A list of recognized sources can be found at http://go.usa.gov/3vPDS. These software products are considered assessed and require no additional formal test or evaluation, so long as the actual environment, use, and configuration aligns with the intended environment, use, and configuration documented in the assessment package. Compliance with this decision is contingent upon the following conditions: 2.1.  The software product and major version is verified on one of the recognized sources. 2.2.   Prior to implementation, the system/enclave ISSM must implement any required mitigations to reduce the security risk. 2.3.  The system/enclave ISSM must update their applicable RMF documentation and hardware/software lists to reflect any solutions implemented.  This update will be considered a no security impact modification to the system authorization. 3.  Software Products Excluded from AF SACA. The following software products must be submitted through the AF Enterprise AO processes: 3.1.  Products whose main function is encryption, but does not have Federal Information Processing Standard 140-2 certification. 3.2.  Software that does not have a vendor or sponsor responsible for developing security patches. 3.3.  Software with immitigable Moderate (CAT II) or higher vulnerabilities. 3.4.  Software that uses ports, protocols, or services not listed in the DoD Category Assurance List (CAL). 3.5.  Unsupported freeware and shareware. 3.6.  Open Source Software (OSS) with no configuration/software support plan. 3.7.  IA or IA-enabled products/software (IAW CNSSP No. 11, National Policy Governing the Acquisition of Information Assurance (IA) and IA-Enabled Information Technology Products).  42 AFI17-101  2 FEBRUARY 2017 Attachment 3 FINANCIAL IMPROVEMENT AND AUDIT READINESS (FIAR) IT CONTROLS GUIDANCE (OPR: AF/FM) 1.  PURPOSE. The purpose of this publication is to articulate mandatory guidance necessary to help ensure AF FIAR systems (described below) are authorized in a manner that promotes AF audit readiness under the terms of DoD Comptroller [OUSD(C)] Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) Guidance. 2. SCOPE. 2.1.  The scope of this attachment encompasses AF system authorization processes relating to all AF systems designated by SAF/FM as AF FIAR systems.  2.2.  FIAR systems are defined as core financial systems, mixed-systems, non-financial systems, and micro-applications that support key financial processes (i.e., general ledger management, funds management, payment management, receivable management, and cost management).  They include systems that are relevant to financial statement disclosures, and that must operate reliably to protect the integrity of financial statement assertions.  The list below describes characteristics that place a system in-scope for FIAR: • Controls within the system are identified as key controls in the internal controls assessment; • Systems are used to generate or store original key supporting documentation; • Reports generated by the system are utilized in the execution of key controls; or • Systems are relied upon to perform material calculations (i.e., to compute payroll). 2.3.  This attachment’s scope does not encompass system authorization processes relating to non-FIAR systems, nor does it include the full range of cybersecurity controls required to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of AF systems and applications.  3.  APPLICABILITY. This publication applies to: 3.1.  All AF FIAR systems.  AF FIAR systems may include but are not limited to:  information systems (enclaves, major applications), IT services (internal & external), and IT products (software, hardware, applications).  3.2.  All financial or financially-related information that is processed, stored, displayed, and/or transmitted by AF FIAR systems. 3.3.

In coordination with the ISSM, initiate protective or corrective measures when a financial incident or vulnerability is discovered; cooperate with the implementation of the POA&M. 5.  PROCESS. The following process descriptions are intended to augment the systems authorization process described in Chapter 3; this supplemental guidance is applicable as described above. 5.1.  FIAR Considerations in RMF Step One, Categorize System. 5.1.1.  IAW categorization guidance contained in CNSSI No. 1253 (Reference (e)) and NIST Special Publication 800-60, Volume 2 (Reference (f)), the baseline security categorization for AF FIAR systems, exclusive of special factors affecting confidentiality, integrity and availability, is, at a minimum, as follows: Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Low)} 5.1.2.  Special factors affecting confidentiality.  Confidentiality impacts are generally associated with the sensitivity of specific AF projects’ existence, programs, and/or technologies that might be revealed by unauthorized disclosure of financial information. If an AF FIAR system contains financial information pertaining to sensitive programmatic or technical information, the baseline confidentiality value may be raised to Moderate.  If the existence of programs or technologies is classified, the baseline confidentiality value may be raised to High. 5.1.3.  Special factors affecting integrity.  Fraud and errors can affect the AF’s image, and corrective actions are often disruptive to operations.  Errors represent the greatest threat; if an AF FIAR system contains financial information, the integrity of which supports or is considered crucial to a key decision-making process, the baseline integrity value may be raised to High. 5.1.4.  Special factors affecting availability. Permanent loss/unavailability of financial management information can temporarily cripple AF financial operations.  If an AF FIAR system contains financial information, the temporary or permanent loss of which would result in a serious adverse effect on AF financial operations or assets, or other DoD or federal financial operations or assets, the baseline availability value may be raised to Moderate; e.g., the unavailability of a given application and/or it’s information output could directly or indirectly trigger a potentially material erroneous financial event.  If an AF FIAR system contains financial information, the temporary or permanent loss of which would result in severe or catastrophic adverse effect on AF financial operations or assets, or other DoD or federal government financial operations or assets, the baseline availability value may be raised to High, e.g., the unavailability of a given application and/or it’s information output could directly or indirectly triggers erroneous financial events across multiple systems, and/or in a manner that is like to result in a material impact on financial reporting. 5.2  FIAR Considerations in RMF Step Two, Select Security Controls. 5.2.1.  Many RMF controls and enhancements are identical, or very similar, to analogous FISCAM controls, but require supplementation.  DoD’s instantiation of RMF allows for supplementary overlays to be issued addressing such specific needs; these overlays levy requirements that modify the standard RMF control baselines.  OSD developed one such overlay, Supplemental Implementation Instruction for Systems Impacting Financial Statement Audit Readiness, that is intended to be implemented by all DoD components and financial and 46 AFI17-101  2 FEBRUARY 2017 financially-relevant systems.  However, OSD’s guidance allows for flexibility of implementation, stating: “If during the audit readiness process it is determined that a FISCAM control technique is not key to addressing the control objectives, then the associated RMF/NIST security control would no longer be required for financial statement audit readiness purposes." 5.2.2.  AF FIAR systems must apply the control baseline appropriate to each system’s overall security categorization, and tailor the resulting controls as appropriate on a system-by-system basis.  Controls may be added to address non-financial concerns (i.e., cybersecurity, operational), or intentionally not implemented to contain costs and allow functionality consistent with risk.  Such decisions should be the result of a consultative process between IOs, ISOs, PMs, ISSMs, AOs, with a full appreciation for AF financial control objectives.  Appendix 1 to this publication contains a list of controls that must be considered.  ISSMs and ISSOs should take into consideration and leverage the results of prior inspections and audits, including risk assessments performed in support of OMB Circular A-123. 5.2.3.  AF FIAR system PMs, ISOs, ISSMs, and ISSOs must additionally determine which FIAR controls are common to, and/or inherited by, their respective systems/applications.  As noted in NIST SP 800-53 r4, the determination as to whether a security control is common or inherited is context-based, and cannot be characterized as common or inherited simply based on reviewing the language of the control.  Many FIAR systems will benefit from inheriting some of the controls from a common service provider; that is, their system or application receives protection from security controls (or portions of security controls) that are developed, implemented, assessed, authorized, and monitored by entities internal or external to the system/application’s responsible organization. 5.2.4.  AF FIAR system PMs and ISSM must document all controls relevant to the system or application in a form suitable for presentation to IT auditors.  ISSMs should be able to describe in detail which controls are the responsibility of the program, which are shared between the program and an external service provider, and which are inherited from an external service provider. 5.3.  FIAR Considerations in RMF Step Three, Implement Security Controls. Effective AF FIAR control implementation requires the controls be properly designed, implemented, and operated. 5.3.1.  Security Control Design:  Proper control design is demonstrated by an architecture of guidance and documentation that includes: A specific description of the control as it is applies to the system/application environment, including identification of the responsible person(s)/organization(s); Identification of governing local, AF, and/or DoD plans and policies; Identification of relevant technical, operational, or behavioral standards; and Documented procedures addressing the steps for implementing and monitoring the control. All design documentation must be in final form; documents in draft form will not be considered authoritative for audit purposes.   AFI17-101  2 FEBRUARY 2017 47 5.3.2.  Security Control Implementation:  Proper control implementation is demonstrated by provision of evidentiary materials that prove the control is in place and operating effectively.  Evidentiary matter can include but is not limited to: Meeting minutes Organizations emails Populated decision matrices Formal (i.e., signed and dated) forms, reports, and decision papers Configuration management records System logs Recent operational system records/dumps Reconciliation records 5.4.  FIAR Considerations in RMF Step Four, Assess Security Controls. Generally accepted financial audit methodology provides standard procedures for testing both control design and control effectiveness.   5.4.1.  Tests of Design (TOD).  TOD procedures are performed first; if TOD tests are not passed, the control may be failed in its entirety at the auditor’s discretion.   5.4.2.  Tests of Effectiveness (TOE).  If TOD tests are passed, auditors will execute TOE procedures to assess whether the control is operating as designed and effective in its operation.  Should a control not pass TOE, the control will be failed; auditor discretion will be applied to determine the severity of the failure. 5.4.3.  Creating, Maintaining, and Presenting Evidence.   5.4.3.1.  Evidentiary matter need only supply sufficient evidence of a given control’s effectiveness and management’s due diligence in continuous monitoring.  It is neither required nor desired that evidence be created for no other purpose, or embellished past the point of management’s legitimate needs.   5.4.3.2.  Evidence will be maintained in the eMASS system of record. eMASS provides a venue for organizing and storing digital information; however, some evidence does not lend itself to digital storage and may be best preserved in hard copy.   5.4.3.3.  Some evidentiary records must be created on an ad hoc basis at the auditor’s request.  PMs, ISOs, and ISSM’s should coordinate with the audit team as early as possible to gain an understanding of such possible requests. 5.4.4.  Minimizing the impact of audit investigations on mission operations requires pre-audit and pre-interview coordination between the PM, ISSM, and audit team. 5.4.4.1.  PMs should expect to receive a request from the audit team for evidentiary documents in the form of a Document Request List (DRL) or Provided By Client (PBC) request, and be prepared to respond in a timely manner. (Average allotted time to provide evidence is 2 weeks from date PBC is received by the AF team).   5.4.4.2.  PMs should coordinate with the audit team to help ensure interview objectives are clearly articulated by the auditor in order to limit the need for multiple interviews on the same subject and ensure all relevant/knowledgeable system/application personnel are available during the interview.   5.4.4.3.  PMs should coordinate with the audit team to help ensure all DRL/PBC requests are satisfied at least 1 day prior to interviews. 5.5.  FIAR Considerations in RMF Step Five, Authorize the System. 5.5.1.  AF FIAR system AOs must obtain the advice and consent of a designated SAF/FM CIO or designated representative before issuing an authorization decision for an AF FIAR system.  48 AFI17-101  2 FEBRUARY 2017 5.5.2  FM ISO’s coordination on authorization decisions must be formally signed and retained. 5.6.  FIAR Considerations in RMF Step Six, Monitor Security Controls. AF FIAR system control monitoring will take place both in-process and periodically through internal reviews and external inspections.  5.6.1.  AF FIAR systems will be configured to preserve AF financial information’s integrity to the greatest extent practical.  AF FIAR system ISSOs must configure their respective systems/applications to automatically identify and handle error conditions in an expeditious manner without providing information that could be exploited by adversaries.  Examples of automated integrity functions include, but are not limited to: Batch totals Sequence checking Reconciliations Control totals 5.6.2  AF FIAR PMs must develop and implement management procedures to identify and correct errors that occur during data entry and processing.  Error handling procedures must provide reasonable assurance that errors and irregularities are detected, reported, and corrected.  This audit and monitoring capability should include: User error logs to provide timely follow-up and correction of unresolved data errors and irregularities,   An established monitoring process to assure the effectiveness of error handling procedures, and  Procedures to periodically review user error logs to determine the extent to which data errors are being made, and the status of uncorrected data errors. 5.6.3.AF FIAR system PMs must initiate prompt action to correct deficiencies identified through internal monitoring or external inspection.  This includes maintenance of a formal POA&M, as well as procedures to:  Ensure the accuracy of POA&M information. Prioritize POA&M items based on cost, level of complexity, risk, and impact on the financial statement.  Determine whether control weaknesses identified through IT audits are included in the POA&Ms, and, if not, determining the cause.  Ensure the timely resolution of identified deficiencies.  OMB Circular A-123 recommends audit remediation items be addressed within 6 months. 6.  FM Control Implementation Guidance. The RMF process is similar to the DoD C&A process it replaced, but the scope of ‘risk management’ is substantially greater.  While the former process was sharply focused on IT risk, the RMF encompasses both IT risk and business risk, and tends DoD program managers (PMs) to a more varied view of risk that can be continuously monitored at both program and enterprise levels.   This is a favorable development for DoD’s financial managers, as the RMF controls baseline aligns more closely with the controls precepts and baselines that are intended to protect the integrity of financial information and processes as expressed in the Government Accountability Office (GAO) Federal Information System Controls Audit Manual (FISCAM).  Viewed broadly, RMF controls accord with financial substantially, although not completely; in other words, successfully executing the RMF process is tantamount to satisfying most, but not all of the IT general controls in the FISCAM control baseline. AFI17-101  2 FEBRUARY 2017 49 As the AF transitions to the new system authorization process, the AF decided to leverage the RMF to achieve AF financial audit readiness as directed by DoD Comptroller guidance, Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR).  To this end, Secretary of the Air Force/ Financial Management (SAF/FM) developed financial management (FM) supplemental guidance to augment and extend the RMF controls baseline to fully address all financial and financially relevant controls.  This control guidance is intended to be used in  conjunction with the RMF process as it is applied to AF financial and financially-related IT, the goal being to use the RMF process to satisfy cybersecurity and FISCAM controls guidance simultaneously. The Appendix below presents a list of controls that SAF/FM determined to be mandatory for all AF FIAR systems, as well as a list of controls that SAF/FM determined as candidates for tailoring-out on a system-by-system basis.   As noted above in section 2, the controls presented in the appendix relate to securing financial information, and do not encompass the full range of cybersecurity controls that may be required to attain an unqualified ATO. Appendix 1 to Attachment 3 AF FIAR SYSTEM MANDATORY AND TAILORABLE AF FINANCIAL CONTROLS This Appendix presents all controls that are or may be applicable to AF FIAR systems.  These include both controls presented in NIST SP 800-60 volume 2, as well as additional controls that SAF/FM determined to be mandatory for implementation in AF FIAR systems.  Controls that SAF/FM determined to be of insufficient relevance to the AF Financial statement, or which are likely to prove uneconomic or operationally infeasible, are so indicated as ‘Tailorable’ in the Appendix column titled "Control Ranking", so long as those controls are not specified as mandatory for connection to the AFIN.  At the discretion of the pertinent AO, controls so indicated can be tailored out of AF FIAR systems' control baselines for the purposes of financial reporting.  However, nothing presented in this Appendix is intended to preclude control implementations that are required for cybersecurity or operational purposes.  The complete list of financial management overlay controls can be found here.
