Overview.  An important aspect of our Air Force Global Partnership Strategy is to expand relationships  with  our  allies  and  partners.    Providing  support  to  visiting  foreign  national  or international  war  colleges  is  instrumental  in  educating  allies  and  partners  about  specific  Air Force  capabilities,  building  confidence  between  nations,  and  laying  the  groundwork  for interoperable  air  forces.    AFPD  16-1  establishes  that  the  Deputy  Under  Secretary  of  the  Air Force  (International  Affairs)  is  responsible  for  visits  of  foreign  officials  to  Air  Force installations.    CJCSI  2211.01B,  Visits  by  Students  or  Staff  Members  of  Foreign  National  or International Defense Colleges, instructs the Air Force to perform duties as Lead Agent for visits by  the  Pakistan  National  Defense  University,  the  Korean  National  Defense  College,  the Colombian Superior War College (General Officer's Course), and other similar foreign national or  international  defense  colleges,  when  approved  for  visits.    The  Air  Force  may  use  Official Representation Funds (ORF) in connection with these duties, in accordance with DoDI 7250.13, Use  of  Appropriated  Funds  for  Official  Representation  Purposes,  Enclosure  4,  paragraph  1.b.  This instruction will serve as a guide for all Air Force participants hosting and supporting these visits.  A coordinated Air Force effort will ensure appropriate support is provided to the visiting institutions.    The  success  of  these  visits  will  directly  affect  relationships  with  our  allies  and partners and is important in support of national and regional politico-military objectives. 1.1.1.  Any  similar  visits  by  students  of  foreign  military  institutions,  not  covered  by  CJCSI 2211.01B that are sponsored by the Air Force, are covered by this AFI. 1.1.2.  In  accordance  with  DoDI  4515.7,  Use  of  Motor  Transportation  and  Scheduled  DoD Bus Service in the National Capital Region, the National Capital Region (NCR) is defined as “The  District  of  Columbia,  Montgomery  and  Prince  George's  Counties  in  Maryland,  and Arlington, Fairfax, Loudoun, and Prince William Counties in Virginia, and all the cities and towns included within the outer boundaries of the foregoing counties.” AFI16-116  27 JANUARY 2010 3 Chapter 2 RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.

General Requirements.  As an important part of our Global Partnership Strategy, visits by foreign War Colleges or similar institutions can lay the  groundwork for enduring relationships.  All  United  States  (US)  agencies  supporting  these  visits  must  understand  the  importance  of committing appropriate time and resources to ensure the success of these visits. 3.2.  Funding Requirements.  Reciprocating for support or courtesies provided to foreign travel by US War Colleges is a factor to consider when planning and funding these visits; however, not every level  or type of support or courtesy provided to  visitors from  the US  may be possible or advisable under authorities available in this country.  All funding to support these visits will be in accordance with existing financial regulations and US law.  DoDI 7250.13, and AFI 65-603, provide  details  and  guidance  on  use  of  ORF  funds.    CJCSI  2211.01B  covers  CJCS  policy  on visits by foreign national or international defense colleges and how ORF funds may be used to support portions of those visits. 3.2.1.  As  a  planning  factor,  SAF/IAR,  HAF/RM,  and  AFDW  should  budget  to  support  at least three visits per year. 3.2.1.1.  SAF/IAR will shape itineraries, to the maximum extent possible, such that bases outside the NCR will not be impacted by more than one visit per year. 3.2.2.  US  Government  transportation  may  be  provided  only  to  official  guests,  for  official events,  when  such  transportation  is  available.    US  Government  transportation  will  only  be provided  to  official  guests  (i.e.,  those  on  official  travel  orders  and  accredited  embassy escorts).        When  US  Government  transportation  is  not  available,  SAF/IAR  will  assist  the visiting  institution  in  arranging  commercial  transportation;  however,  the  visiting  institution will  bear  all  costs.    When  arranging  commercial  transportation,  US  personnel  will  not commit the US Government to any financial obligations, nor will they take responsibility for, or obligate, foreign funds. 3.2.3.  Meals or refreshments (to include alcohol) served at hosted official functions may be funded by ORF funds, in compliance with AFI 65-603, and HOI 65-3, HQ USAF Guidance for Official Representation Funds.  The Air Force may provide ORF funds, as approved by the  Office  of  the  Administrative  Assistant  to  the  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  (SAF/AA)  and executed through HAF/RM, for no more than two hosted functions in the NCR area per visit.  Additionally,  if  field  commanders  request,  the  Air  Force  may  provide  ORF  funds  to  field commanders  for  one  hosted  function  at  each  command  visited.    The  amount  of  funds provided  will  be  IAW  DOD  and  Air  Force  instructions  and  policies  governing  the  use  of ORF funds. 3.2.4.  Some  Latin  America  (LATAM)  visits  and  functions  may  be  funded  by  LATAM COOP  funds.    The  expenditure  of  these  funds  is  governed  by  AFI  16-102,  Latin  American Cooperation  (LATAM  COOP)  Fund.    The  Chief,  Americas  Division,  SAF/IA  (SAF/IARL) administers  the  LATAM  COOP  fund,  and  will  ensure  appropriate  use  of  the  funds  for itineraries  of  visiting  LATAM  institutions.    AFSOUTH,  AFNORTH,  NORTHCOM,  and USAFA have been delegated authority to commit LATAM COOP funds within their areas of responsibility, within the limits prescribed by AFI 16-102. AFI16-116  27 JANUARY 2010 9 3.2.5.  All expenses for food, lodging, gratuities, social functions, cultural activities, etc. for visiting personnel, except as indicated in paragraphs 3.2.2., 3.2.3., and 3.2.4. above, will be borne by the visiting institution. 3.2.6.  The visiting institution retains responsibility for all travel expenses and for arranging transportation,  meals,  and  lodging  throughout  the  duration  of  the  visit.    The  Air  Force  will assist  the  visiting  institution  in  making  these  arrangements,  as  necessary.    The  Air  Force may, but is not required to, provide ground transportation, when available, outside the NCR, as  authorized  and  approved  by  appropriate  authority  consistent  with  Air  Force  and  DoD guidance, and paragraph 3.2.2 above.  When providing this assistance, US personnel will not commit the US Government to any financial obligations, nor will they take responsibility for, or in any way obligate, foreign funds. 3.2.6.1.  Air  Force  units  supporting  these  visits  will  follow  applicable  travel  regulations whenever military transportation will be used during a visit. 3.2.7.  Some of the costs to support these visits are not paid by the visiting institution, such as per diem, lodging, and travel costs of escort officers.  Units providing escort officers will be expected to pay these costs out of unit funds. 3.3.  Planning Timeline.  SAF/IAR, as Lead Agent, will set the timeline to successfully support each  visit.    SAF/IAR  will  maintain  a  checklist  and  associated  timeline  for  items  that  must  be accomplished  to  ensure  a  successful  visit.    This  checklist  will  be  provided  to  each  supporting agency no later than the initial planning meeting. 3.3.1.  At  a  minimum,  SAF/IAR,  AF/CVAI,  and  AFDW  will  send  a  representative  to  all planning meetings. 3.3.2.  Any  other  units  designated  to  support  visits  will  attend  meetings  as  requested  by SAF/IAR. 3.3.3.  Initial planning meeting will be held as soon as possible after an unannounced, short-notice visit request, or 90 days prior to an expected visit, whichever occurs first. 3.3.3.1.  If not sent out electronically prior to the initial planning meeting, SAF/IAR will provide a detailed checklist at the initial planning meeting. 3.3.4.  Subsequent meetings will be directed by SAF/IAR, but at a minimum, will be held 60 days, 30 days, and two weeks prior to a visit. 3.4.  Execution.  Although  various  units  are  tasked  with  specific  requirements  to  ensure  visit success,  the  execution  of  a  successful  visit  requires  teamwork  by  all  supporting  units.    Within two  weeks  of  the  visit,  and  for  the  duration  of  the  visit,  SAF/IAR  may  need  to  direct  HAF organizations  and  MAJCOMs  to  accomplish  tasks  not  specifically  designated  to  them  in  this instruction.    Those  HAF  organizations  and  MAJCOMs  will  be  expected  to  accomplish  the directed tasks, and capture any lessons learned for feedback per paragraph 3.5. below. 3.5.  After  Action  Reports.  In  order  to  improve  the  support  for  these  visits,  each  supporting unit, through its appropriate chain of command, will provide lessons learned to SAF/IAR within 30 days of the visit’s conclusion.  SAF/IAR will compile all lessons learned into an after action report  for  all  supporting  units’  benefit.    Lessons  learned  will  be  used  to  modify  existing checklists for future visits to improve support. 10 AFI16-116  27 JANUARY 2010 Chapter 4 UNIQUE REQUIREMENTS FOR SPECIFIC COUNTRY VISITS 4.1.  General.  Some visiting institutions have unique requirements that go beyond the standard requirements  outlined  in  Chapter  3,  and  require  additional  efforts  beyond  the  standard  list  of responsibilities outlined in Chapter 2.  The unique by-country requirements listed in this chapter will  be  considered  additive  to  the  requirements  and  responsibilities  listed  elsewhere  in  this instruction. 4.2.  China.  DoD Instruction C-2000.23, Conduct of DoD Contacts with the People’s Republic of China (PRC) (U), establishes policy, assigns responsibilities, and prescribes procedures for the management of DoD contacts with the PRC and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA), and  outlines  measures  for  compliance  with  the  National  Defense  Authorization  Act  (NDAA) 2000,  Public  Law  106-65,  Section  1201,  “Limitation  on  Military-to-Military  Exchanges  and Contacts with Chinese People’s Liberation Army,” October 1, 1999. 4.2.1.  Any planned Air Force exchanges or contact with the PRC must be coordinated with SAF/IAR in the month of September prior to the exchange or contact. 4.3.  Colombia.  Colombian  Superior  War  College  (CSWC).    CSWC  visit  is  usually  limited  to the NCR.  Requirements are already covered in previous chapters of this AFI. 4.3.1.  Per  CJCSI  2211.01B,  all  expenses  are  paid  by  Colombia.    US  Government transportation may be provided only to official guests and only in and around the NCR, when such transportation is available.  Use of ORF funds will be IAW CJCSI 2211.01B, paragraph 4.e., and paragraph 3.2.3. of this AFI. 4.4.  Latin America (LATAM).  Use of LATAM COOP funds is governed by AFI 16-102, and is  discussed  in  paragraph  3.2.4.  of  this  AFI.      Several  institutions  from  LATAM  countries routinely visit the US, and are hosted by the USAF: 4.4.1.  Brazilian  Air  Command  and  Staff  College  (ACSC).    The  Brazilian  ACSC  typically visits  late summer each  year.  A  Brazilian Air Force aircraft brings about  180 students  and lands at Andrews AFB.  The Brazilian ACSC pays for transportation, lodging, and meals, but seeks baggage support at each locale.  A normal itinerary includes:  three to four days in the NCR; one to two days at Maxwell AFB, visiting Air Command and Staff College; one to two days at Davis-Monthan AFB, visiting AFSOUTH. 4.4.2.  Chilean  Air  Force  Academy  (AFA).    Typically,  75  Chilean  AFA  Cadets  visit  early autumn of each year.  Cadets use commercial air transport throughout their visit.  Chile pays for  all  expenses.    No  support  is  required,  other  than  access  to  bases  and  facilities,  and associated briefings.  Normal itinerary includes the NCR, USAFA, and MacDill AFB. 4.4.3.  Colombian Air Force Academy (AFA).  Colombian AF normally transports about 90 Colombian AFA cadets for a visit to the US in September each year.  Colombia pays for all expenses.    No  support  is  required,  other  than  access  to  bases  and  facilities,  and  associated briefings.  Normal itinerary includes visits to some of the following stops:  the NCR, Nellis AFB, Wright-Patterson AFB, USAFA, USNA, USMA, Atlanta, and Cape Canaveral. AFI16-116  27 JANUARY 2010 11 4.4.4.  Latin American Cadet  Initiative (LACI).  Typically in early autumn of each  year, 30 cadets  from  15  LATAM  countries  fly  individually  via  commercial  air  to  a  specified  US gateway airport and are met by USAF personnel.  LATAM COOP funds pay most expenses, including meals and lodging. 4.4.4.1.  For approximately one week in the NCR, AFDW will provide transportation for the  cadets,  consistent  with  AF  and  DoD  guidelines,  and  IAW  para  2.3.2  of  this instruction; commercial transportation will be used for trips outside of the vicinity of the NCR using LATAM COOP funds. 4.4.4.2.  Trips  during  the  NCR  portion  of  the  visit  can  include  USMA,  USNA,  Dover AFB,  Langley  AFB,  Norfolk  Naval  Base,  and  New  York  City.    Other  itinerary  stops include  a  week  at  USAFA  and  five  days  at  the  Inter-American  Air  Forces  Academy  at Lackland AFB, TX. 4.4.5.  Peruvian  Air  War  College  (AWC).    Peruvian  AWC  normally  brings  30  students  via commercial air in the late summer each year.  The visit is limited to the NCR area, and lasts about  5-6  days.    This  visit  is  funded  by  US  Southern  Command  Traditional  Commander’s Activity  funds.    Peruvian  AWC  normally  requests  USAF  transportation  support  for  their visit. 4.5.  Korea.  Korean National  Defense College (KNDC).  Requirements  are already  covered in previous chapters of this AFI. 4.5.1.  Per CJCSI 2211.01B, all expenses are paid by Korea.

JFCOM  briefings  expand  students’ knowledge of US processes for conducting joint operations. 4.6.1.2.  US  Central  Command  (CENTCOM).    Students  receive  briefings  on  their  AOR and  also  visit  with  the  Pakistan  CENTCOM  liaison  officers  stationed  at  MacDill  AFB, FL. 4.6.1.3.  US  Special  Operations  Command  (SOCOM).    SOCOM  briefings  educate students on the role of our special operations forces. 4.6.2.  PNDU routinely brings third country nationals who attend PNDU.  These individuals’ names and home countries must be known early in the coordination process to ensure access.  Some  countries  require  disclosure  review  for  what  material  will  be  presented.    It  is imperative  the  third  country  nationals’  names  and  home  countries  be  provided  to  all supporting agencies NLT 60 days in advance of the visit. 4.6.3.
