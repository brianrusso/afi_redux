This instruction addresses the AF GI&S and imagery disciplines, collectively known as GEOINT.  GEOINT enables area familiarization and monitoring, feasibility assessments, target development,  weapon  effectiveness  and  collateral  damage  estimation  (CDE)  assessment, formulation  of  courses  of  action  and  estimation  of  consequences  of  execution,  and  strategic, operational,  and  tactical  planning  for  all  missions.    It  also  supports  training,  mission  planning, mission  rehearsal,  navigation,  modeling/simulation,  and  all  weapon  system  development required  to  execute  the  aforementioned  capabilities.    Air  Force  (AF)  GEOINT  capabilities encompass all imagery (excluding ground-based, hand-held), Imagery Intelligence (IMINT), and geospatial information and related products, tools, processes, resources, and systems supporting AF missions see Figure A4.1, Air Force GEOINT Capabilities.  AF GEOINT also includes the ancillary  data  and  associated  capabilities  needed  for  collection  management,  data  processing, exploitation, archiving, and dissemination. 1.1.1.  The  Air  Force  Targeting  and  GEOINT  Division  (AF/A2CG)  provides  oversight  and authoritative  guidance  on  GEOINT  issues.    However,  additional  organizations  maintain functional  responsibilities  for  other  geospatial  products  and  services.    For  example,  the  AF Flight Standards Agency (AFFSA) has functional responsibility for DoD Flight Information Publications  (FLIP),  Digital  Aeronautical  Flight  Information  File  (DAFIF),  and  other materials;  the  Director  of  Civil  Engineers  (AF/A4C)  has  policy  authority  for  the  AF Installation GI&S (IGI&S) program,  known  as GeoBase;  and the Joint Personnel  Recovery Agency  (JPRA)  is  responsible  for  Evasion  Charts.    Consequently,  the  AF  GEOINT  Vision and  Strategy  are  developed  across  AF  directorates  and  functions  to  maximize  efficiency through common AF GEOINT requirements. 1.1.2.  GEOINT is  collected, produced, and consumed across a broad range of AF missions and capabilities.  Its subject matter equities and dependencies coexist in multiple functional areas (e.g., intelligence, operations, civil engineering, security forces, etc.).  To enable these diverse  areas  to  operate  efficiently  and  effectively,  they  interface  with  the  National  System for  Geospatial-Intelligence  (NSG)  and  Allied  System  for  Geospatial  Intelligence  (ASG) Communities.    The  Director,  NGA  is  the  DoD  GEOINT  Functional  Manager  (FM)  IAW DoDD  5105.60  with  authority  to  provide  GEOINT  functional  guidance  to  the  NSG.    The director  also  coordinates  the  ASG.    These  two  systems  for  GEOINT  are  the  policies, doctrine,  people,  capabilities,  activities,  and  technology  used  to  produce  GEOINT  in  an integrated, multi-intelligence environment.  The NSG community consists of members of the United  States  (US) intelligence  community  (IC),  military  departments,  Combatant Commands  (CCMD),  and  elements  of  the  civil  community.    In  contrast,  the  ASG  is  an integrated,  US  and  Commonwealth  partnership  of  GEOINT  professionals  working  together to meet collective operational and intelligence needs, while providing each other with global, regional, and civil GEOINT support.  The NSG advances the GEOINT enterprise to make the best GEOINT available to partners, customers, and decision makers through better-informed decisions, improved alignment, and harmonized efforts across the NSG.  Through increased GEOINT integration, the NSG intends to exercise better stewardship of GEOINT resources, 6 AFI14-132  23 DECEMBER 2016 improve  coordination,  and  where  appropriate,  apply  unified  solutions  to  increase  the  scope and utility of GEOINT. 1.2.  Air  Force  GEOINT  Enterprise  Governance.  AF/A2CG  represents  the  AFGE.    The AFGE  is  an  integrated  system  of  people,  organizations,  technology,  policies,  capabilities, doctrine, processes, and data necessary to provide GEOINT effectively across AF core mission areas to support Joint Capability Areas in a multi-domain environment.  The AFGE spans the full cross-functional  nature  of  GEOINT  (both  GI&S  and  ISR)  and  involves  AF/A2,  MAJCOM, Direct Reporting Units (DRU), Field Operating Agencies (FOA), and a broad and collaborative community  across  the  DoD.    AFGE  strategy,  goals,  and  objectives  are  aligned  with  strategies and  roadmaps  across  the  Air  Force  and  the  NSG/ASG.    The  AFGE  ensures  AF  GEOINT  core services,  applications,  products,  and  data  comply  with  published  IC,  DoD,  and  NSG  standards and  synchronizes  AF  GEOINT  operations  with  the  NSG/ASG  to  enable  decisive  action.    Air Force producers, providers, and/or consumers of GEOINT ensure that data and data services are compliant  with  DoD,  IC,  and  NSG  policies  specified  in  NSG  Directive  (NSGD)  3201,  The GEOINT Functional Manager Standards Assessment (GFMSA) Program. 1.3.  Forums,  Committees,  and  Working  Groups.  The  AFGE  aligns  mission-driven  AF GEOINT producers, consumers, and staff elements (positioned at tactical, theater, and strategic levels)  to  perform  requirements  management,  education  and  training,  unit  readiness,  systems acquisition,  production  and  technology  modernization,  and  advocacy  tasks  to  integrate  cross-functional capabilities ensuring joint capability and core mission area effectiveness.  The AFGE implements collaborative business practices to ensure data integrity standards and cross-security domain dissemination.  Forums, committees, meetings, and working groups are routinely held to ensure  incorporation  of  geospatial  requirements  into  the  formal  requirements  process  of acquisition initiatives and programs and eliminate duplication of effort include: 1.3.1.  NSG Senior Management Council (NSMC).  NSMC is chaired by the GEOINT FM.  It is the senior, flag-level functional management forum for the global GEOINT community.  NSMC meets semiannually to  allow senior leadership of NSG organizations an opportunity to discuss the strategic, community-wide issues facing the GEOINT community and outline NSG future priorities.  AF/A2 or designee is the AF representative to the NSMC. 1.3.2.  National GEOINT Committee (GEOCOM).  The GEOCOM and subcommittees meet to  provide  GEOINT  consumers  and  producers  opportunities  to  collaborate,  coordinate,  and exchange information about GEOINT issues and build consensus on matters associated with GEOINT across the NSG.  The GEOCOM provides strategic perspective on GEOINT-related activities and maintains advocacy for mission threads of strategic value to the GEOINT FM to include promotion of cross-discipline and cross-functional integration.  It is the key forum to  review  and  recommend  long-term  GEOINT  strategies,  and  to  assess  and  advise  the GEOINT  FM  on  plans,  programs,  activities,  policies  and  guidance  that  could  have  a significant  impact  on  current  or  future  GEOINT  capabilities.    Additionally,  the  GEOCOM provides  opportunities  to  conduct  independent  evaluations,  studies,  and  assessments  of GEOINT products, services, capabilities, stakeholder equities and other GEOINT issues and topics.  The AF/A2C (or his/her designee) is the AF representative to the GEOCOM. 1.3.3.  GEOINT  Capability  Team  (GCT).    The  GCT  provides  a  forum  to  corporately prioritize  and  plan  AF  airborne  GEOINT  capability  solutions  utilizing  Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) investments.  It strives to provide AF decision-AFI14-132  23 DECEMBER 2016 7 makers  a  comprehensive  capabilities-based,  architecturally  supportable  investment  strategy for AF airborne GEOINT systems consistent with prioritized AF, Joint, and National users’ requirements.  The GCT does not authorize movement of resources across program elements (PEs);  rather,  it  enables  synchronization  across  PEs  within  a  common  planning  and prioritization  framework.    The  GCT  is  co-led  by  Air  Combat  Command,  ISR  Weapon Systems  Division  (ACC/A5I)  and  the  Assistant  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  for  Acquisition, Information Dominance (SAF/AQI). 1.3.4.  Intelligence  Support  Working  Group  (ISWG).    An  ISWG  brings  together  functional representatives  from  the  intelligence,  logistics,  operations  and  acquisition  communities  to assess  their  collaborative  ability  to  adequately  support  each  effort  at  a  level  that  enables mission  success.    Responsibilities  of  an  ISWG  derive  requirements  and  verify  their traceability;  identify,  and  assess  deficiencies  and  shortfalls;  research  and  develop  potential solutions  to  the  deficiencies;  create  action  plans  to  accomplish  those  solutions;  estimate solution  costs;  and  document  results.    The  frequency  of  face-to-face  or  virtual  ISWG meetings  vary,  depending  on  the  intelligence  sensitivity  of  the  effort,  the  visibility  of  the effort, congressional oversight, etc.  ISWG meetings are held annually; however, the ISWG team  members  continually  interact  between  formal  meetings  to  identify,  refine,  clarify requirements, and discuss potential solutions.  ISWG meetings occur more frequently as an effort matures, particularly prior to major acquisition life cycle milestones, or when directed by the Program Manager (PM). 1.3.5.  Aeronautical Safety of Navigation (SoN) Working Groups.  The various SoN working groups  (e.g.,  Flight  Information  Publications  (FLIP),  Data  Aeronautical  Working  Group (DAWG), Digital Aeronautical Transformation Working Group (DATWG), Digital Working Group  (DWG),  and  the  Vertical  Obstruction  Working  Group  (VOWG))  are  in-residence working-level  forums  held  every  six  months.    These  working  groups,  the  O-6  Executive Steering  Group  and  the  Flag/General  Officer  Steering  Group  are  attended  by  military, civilians,  contractors,  and  industry  partners  from  the  US  and  commonwealth  partners  with the express purpose of maintaining the most current information and highest quality services for US military forces and global transport networks. 1.3.6.  Technical  Exchange  Meeting  (TEM).    TEMs  are  the  most  common  working-level forum  for  face-to-face,  fact-finding,  problem-solving,  and  coordination  of  acquisition initiative or program action items.  A typical TEM could be squadron-level mission planners meeting  with  software  developers  to  clarify  system  compatibility  issues  or  it  could  be  a meeting  of  acquisition  and  intelligence  community  subject  matter  experts  to  seek  solutions for  the  gap  between  geospatial  data  needed  to  fully  support  the  mission,  and  the  data  the provider  can  supply.    TEMs  may  also  be  held  to  discuss  intelligence  supportability  of  one specific  derived  geospatial  requirement  versus  an  ISWG  where  all  of  the  effort’s  derived requirements are identified and discussed.  TEMs are held as needed throughout the effort. 1.3.7.  Cross-Program Analysis (CPA) Meeting.  The goal of CPA is to identify requirements of a similar nature that are shared among acquisition  initiatives or programs.   This effort is valuable to the programs involved because it provides some shielding for a specific program from  paying  for  new  solutions  as  a  sole  requirements  holder.    Identification  of  common requirements  also  raises  the  priority  and  visibility  of  deficiencies  gained  by  tying  multiple AF and joint capabilities to the same requirement.  If a solution to a shared requirement has 8 AFI14-132  23 DECEMBER 2016 already  been  produced  by  another  program  or  initiative,  the  effort  in  question  could potentially avoid associated costs entirely. 1.4.  Intelligence  Oversight  Compliance.  Although  missions  deriving  GEOINT  data  do  not usually  risk  divulging  US  person  information,  some  capabilities  employed  in  the  US  during RDT&E  and  training  may.    Regardless,  all  personnel  involved  in  the  conduct  of  GEOINT activities  must  comply  with  intelligence  oversight  procedures  IAW  AFI  14-104,  Oversight  of Intelligence Activities. AFI14-132  23 DECEMBER 2016 9 Chapter 2 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.

The AFGPC uses the best available geospatial source data to create high-priority geospatial datasets  and  products  to  meet  the  specific  geospatial  needs  of  AF  users.    With  production directed  by  AF/A2CG,  AFGPC  produces  all  data  and  products  to  NGA  specification.  AFGPC  is  capable  of  producing  all  standard  NGA  products  with  the  exception  of  APG, CIB®,  and  Digital  Point  Positioning  Data  Bases  (DPPDB).    All  requirements  destined  for AFGPC are validated by AF/A2CG. 2.20.3.  Intelligence  Director,  Air  Force  Life  Cycle  Management  Center  (AFLCMC/IN).  AFLCMC/IN  identifies  and  coordinates  support  for  the  GEOINT  requirements  of  all  AF Foreign  Military  Sales  (FMS)  programs.    These  programs  are  of  high  importance  to  US-Allied cooperation.  Because FMS cases are based on a wide variety of circumstances, each is  negotiated  by  NGA  through  AF/A2CG.    Working  in  coordination  with  the  Air  Force Security  Assistance  and  Cooperation  Directorate  (AFSAC)  and  FMS  program  offices, AFLCMC/IN  requests  release  of  NGA  products  to  FMS  programs  in  the  form  of  a memorandum  to  AF/A2CG,  a  minimum  of  90  days  prior  to  required  delivery  date.

Establish  a  GI&S  Point  of  Contact  (POC)  trained  sufficiently  to  conduct  their assigned  responsibilities  (T-1).    AF/A2CG  endeavors  to  increase  the  understanding  of  the geospatial function and the need to further integrate GI&S with the other GEOINT, targeting and  battlespace  awareness  functions.    Failure  to  have  a  basic  foundation  of  GI&S understanding  among  key  personnel  can impact  operations  and  degrade  mission effectiveness.    Formal  NGA  training  should  be  considered  as  a  minimum.    While  in-residence training is preferred, training by NGA mobile training teams is acceptable. 2.26.2.  Supply  the  name  of  a  GI&S  POC  to  AF/A2CG  (T-1).    This  POC  handles  alerts  or taskings  in  reference  to  GI&S  requirements  and  consolidates  and  forwards  responses  to AF/A2CG. 2.26.3.  Consolidate  and  prioritize  area  and  functional  GI&S  requirement  from  their respective AORs for submission to AF/A2CG in response to annual data calls (T-1). 2.26.4.  Ensure  Program  Management  Offices  (PMO)  falling  outside  materiel  command responsibilities (i.e., PMOs external to AFMC, Rapid Capabilities Office [RCO], Capability Development  Management  Office  [CDMO],  etc.)  submit  requirements  for  geospatial  data and  products  through  the  MAJCOM/A2  to  NGA  using  established  NGA  processes  (T-0). This is accomplished in lieu of IC Production Requests in COLISEUM.  Note:  AFMC also documents these requirements in the LMDP for specific programs. 2.26.5.  Ensure GI&S POCs at all levels establish and maintain GI&S distribution accounts, submit routine and Automatic Distribution (AD)  requests to  the Defense  Logistics Agency, and manage all life-cycle needs of the GPL to ensure currency of the latest data and products AFI14-132  23 DECEMBER 2016 23 and coordinate with  AF  GeoBase  GIO's  as it pertains to  installation data, site planning and bed-down missions (T-2). 2.26.6.

0-I  exploitation)  is  the exploitation  of  newly-acquired  imagery  within  a  specified  time  from  receipt  of  imagery.    The purpose  of  time-dominant  exploitation  is  to  satisfy  priority  requirements  of  immediate  need and/or  to  identify  changes  or  activity  of  immediate  significance,  i.e.,  Indications  and  Warning.  Time-dominant  exploitation  and  reporting  is  accomplished  as  soon  as  possible  according  to validated intelligence requirements, but not later than 24 hours after receipt of imagery.  (2) Non-time dominant exploitation (Phase II and Phase III exploitation).  (a) Phase II Exploitation.  The detailed  non-time  dominant  exploitation  of  imagery  scheduled  within  the  bounds  of  analytic requirements  and  timelines  of  need  (typically  within  one  week  after  receipt  of  imagery).    The purpose of second phase exploitation is to provide an organized and comprehensive account of the  intelligence  derived  from  validated  intelligence  requirements  tasking.    (b)  Phase  III Exploitation.    In  depth,  long-range  analysis  that  includes  all  available  sources  of  imagery  and may include information from other sources (SIGINT, human intelligence, MASINT, etc.).  It is in  this  phase  that  detailed,  authoritative  reports  and  strategic  studies  on  specified  installations, objects, and activities are prepared by the agencies participating in the exploitation effort.  Phase III  exploitation  timelines  are  not  bounded  and  typically  exceed  one  week  after  receipt  of imagery.  JP 2-03, Geospatial Intelligence Support in Joint Operations. GeoBase—GeoBase, commissioned July 2001 by the AF Director of Civil Engineers (AF/A4C), is  the  AF  version  of  the  DoD  IGI&S  program  as  established  by  DoDI  8130.01  IGI&S.    It  is  a systematic  cross-functional  approach  to  visualize  and  assess  built  and  natural  infrastructure  in support of business  and operational  missions.  It  provides a standard  yet  agile AF capability to support leaders' and warfighters' needs in both the garrison and expeditionary environments. Georectify—The digital alignment of a satellite or aerial image with a map of the same area.  In georectification,  a  number  of  corresponding  control  points,  such  as  street  intersections,  are marked  on  both  the  image  and  the  map.    These  locations  become  reference  points  in  the subsequent processing of the image.  ESRI GIS Dictionary Geospatial  Engineering—Geospatial  engineering  encompasses  those  tasks  that  provide geospatial  information  and  services  to  enhance  awareness,  understanding,  and  effective  use  of the operational  environment for commanders and staffs across the range of military operations.  32 AFI14-132  23 DECEMBER 2016 Geospatial engineering provides the JFC with terrain analysis and visualization of the operational environment  through  the  utilization  and  display  of  accurate  terrain  and  other  geospatially referenced  information  and  derived  actionable  advice  that  is  referenced  to  precise  locations  on the earth’s surface.  This geospatial data forms the foundation upon which all other information on the operational environment is layered to form the common operational picture (COP) for the JFC and is an element of GEOINT.  Geospatial engineer units provide strategic, operational, and tactical  terrain  analysis;  terrain  visualization;  digital  terrain  products;  nonstandard  or  updated map products; and baseline survey data to combat, combat support, and CSS forces. Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT)—Is the exploitation and analysis of imagery and geospatial information  to  describe,  assess,  and  visually  depict  physical  features  and  geographically referenced activities on the Earth.  Source:  JP 2-03 Geospatial Information & Services (GI&S)—Is the collection, information extraction, storage, dissemination,  and  exploitation  of  geodetic,  geomagnetic,  imagery  (both  commercial  and national  source),  gravimetric,  aeronautical,  topographic,  hydrographic,  littoral,  cultural,  and toponymic  data  accurately  referenced  to  a  precise  location  on  the  Earth’s  surface.    Geospatial services  include  tools  that  enable  users  to  access  and  manipulate  data,  and  also  include instruction, training, laboratory support, and guidance for the use of geospatial data.  JP 2-03 Imagery—A  likeness  or  presentation  of  any  natural  or  man-made  feature  or  related  object  or activity,  and  the  positional  data  acquired  at  the  same  time  the  likeness  or  representation  was acquired,  including:    products  produced  by  space-based  national  intelligence  reconnaissance systems;  and  likeness  and  presentations  produced  by  satellites,  airborne  platforms,  unmanned aerial  vehicles,  or  other  similar  means  (except  that  such  term  does  not  include  handheld  or clandestine  photography  taken  by  or  on  behalf  of  human  intelligence  collection  organizations).  JP 2-03 Imagery  Intelligence  (IMINT)—The  technical,  geographic,  and  intelligence  information derived through the interpretation or analysis of imagery and collateral materials.  JP 2-03 Orthorectified—Aerial  imagery  typically  provides  a  distorted  representation  of  the  Earth’s surface  due  to  such  things  as  lens  distortion  and  sensor  tilt.    An  orthorectified  image  has  been geometrically corrected such that the scale is uniform, meaning that the image has the same lack of  distortion  as  a  map  or  chart.    Orthorectified  images  can  be  used  to  measure  true  distances, because they provide an accurate representation of the Earth’s surface.  AFI14-132  23 DECEMBER 2016 33 Attachment 2 FRAMEWORK FOR GI&S REQUIREMENTS DEVELOPMENT AND SUBMISSION A2.1.  Purpose and Background.  This attachment may be used by the operations community to define  operational  and  functional  requirements  during  the  requirements  identification  phase  as defined  in  AFI  10-601,  Operational  Capability  Requirements  Development.    Derived  system level requirements are the responsibility of the program office and are addressed in AF Pamphlet 14-111, Intelligence Support to Acquisition.  The use of this framework at AFMC and AFSPC is also  critical  to  ensure that the proper design, development,  delivery, and maintenance of GI&S products  meet  the  complex  GI&S  exploitation  requirements  of  the  AFMC  weapon  system development community. A2.1.1.  This  attachment  may  also  be  used  to  inform  the  systems  engineering,  risk assessment,  cost/manpower  estimate,  and  contract  preparations  processes.    Further,  the content  of  this  attachment  is  intended  for  use  during  GI&S  engineering  analysis  of warfighting capability requirements for the purpose of determining, developing and applying the  most  appropriate  GI&S  solutions  to  enable  operational,  functional  capabilities.    It  has additional  value  when  used  to  check  existing  system  documentation  or  updating  legacy systems  with  new technology.  The systems  used for requirements  generation are  generally used to pass and manage the requirements information.  Questions raised during any of these reviews  should  be  submitted  through  command  intelligence  channels  to  AF/A2CG  for resolution and validation. A2.1.2.  Address  operational  capability  and  functional  requirements  early  and  update throughout  the  system  life  cycle  process  to  ensure  continued  mission  success.    Systems  of interest are defined as weapons, weapon systems, and automated information systems (AIS).  The  majority  of  requirements  are  provided  by  the  operational  community.    ACC  acts  as advocate  for  funding,  and  works  with  the  AFMC  Targeting  and  GEOINT  SPO  for  GI&S materials to support new and updated weapon systems.  New GI&S functional requirements are  forwarded  from  the  relevant  AFMC/A2X  or  AFSPC/A2  office  to  AF/A2CG  for validation.    Fully  processed  requirements  are  then  sent  to  NGA  for  adoption,  development, and  production.    GI&S  Area  requirements  indicate  coverage  of  standard  products  over specific  geographic  areas.    The  content  that  follows  reflects  the  structure  for  developing standardized Geospatial Information & Services (GI&S) requirements systems developed in the  framework  of  AFI  14-111.    It  also  reflects  the  need  for  adequacy  of  GI&S  critical requirements,  as  expressed  by  the  Air  Force  Inspection  Agency’s  Targeting  Accuracy Requirements  Allocation  (TARA)  Eagle  Look,  (EL)  PN06-503.    Defense  Intelligence Agency  Deputy  Director  for  Battlespace  Awareness  (DIA/J28),  within  the  Joint  Staff Directorate  of  Intelligence  (JCS/J2),  oversees  the  Service  and  Combatant  Command  GI&S requirements  process  IAW  CJCSI  3901.01D,  Requirements  for  Geospatial  Information  and Services.    GI&S  requirements  are  also  documented  in  the  Life-cycle  Mission  Data  Plan (LMDP)  IAW  DoDD  5250.01,  Management  of  Intelligence  Mission  Data  (IMD)  in  DoD Acquisition, and AFI 14-111. A2.1.3.  For  new  warfighting  capabilities,  every  attempt  should  be  made  to  identify  new GI&S  needs  early  in  the  acquisition  process.    This  is  necessary  to  allow  the  most comprehensive  and  effective  integration  of  GI&S  at  the  lowest  cost  to  the  program.    The latest  reasonable  identification  of  GI&S  requirements  would  be  at  Milestone  B.    Early 34 AFI14-132  23 DECEMBER 2016 identification of GI&S requirements during system engineering analysis can have a profound impact  on  the  design,  development,  testing,  and  performance  of  a  weapon  system.    It  can provide  the  intelligence  production  community  adequate  lead  time  to  develop  a  new  GI&S product  or  capability  without  negative  impact  to  the  program  cost,  schedule,  and performance.  It also permits comprehensive system-of-systems analysis to ensure GI&S data standardization  and   The identification and documentation of GI&S requirements across the system life cycle may be reflected in a variety of program and planning documents, including the system specification, risk management plan, life-cycle mission data plan, test and evaluation master plan, cost and manpower estimates, requests for proposal (RFP), and statements of work (SOW). interoperability  functionality  across interfacing  systems. A2.1.4.  GEOINT-derived products and data result from the convergence of GI&S, imagery, and imagery intelligence.  The term  GI&S includes orthorectified imagery based geospatial products,  [e.g.,  Controlled  Image  Base,  (CIB®)],  but  not  imagery  intelligence  and  other intelligence.    GI&S  is  the  representation  of  accurate,  attributed,  geo-referenced  data  and information,  arranged  to  describe,  assess,  and  visually  depict  physical  features  and geographically  referenced  activities  on  earth  in  support  of  Air  Force  missions.    It  also includes the related Geodesy and Geophysical (G&G) disciplines. A2.1.5.  The following is an example of how this attachment could be used.  The requirement drafter should use the checklist to make sure all applicable options are considered and ensure the  requirement  meets  the  standard  for  critical  GI&S  information,  particularly  if  the capability  could  be  dependent  upon  one  or  more  GI&S  data/product  inputs.    If  questions arise,  the  writer  consults  the  MAJCOM  GI&S  office  and  works  through  the  chain-of-command supporting capability/system development are generated during research, development, test, evaluation, and  sustainment  activities  executed  within  AFMC.    The  final  validation  authority  for  all GI&S related capabilities and requirements rests with AF/A2CG. to  AF/A2CG,  as  necessary.   Most  GI&S requirements A2.2.  Highlights and Tenets of GI&S Requirements: A2.2.1.  Ensure  all  software  used  with  standard  NGA  products  and  data  is  NGA-certified.  Use  of  approved  Government-Off-The-Shelf/Commercial-Off-The-Shelf  (GOTS/COTS)  is mandatory  [e.g.,  Commercial  Joint  Mapping  Tool  Kit  (CJMTK),  Georgia  Tech  Research Institute (GTRI)-FalconView (FV), Geographic Translator (GEOTRANS), and other mission planning- or operational-related offerings]. A2.2.2.  Ensure use of all geospatial products and data produced outside of NGA and AF is authorized by Air Staff or the appropriate Combatant Command (CCMD). A2.2.3.  Ensure systems are developed to the extent possible to use standard GI&S data that does  not  require  transformation  of  data  for  both  economy  and  interoperability.    If transformations are not avoidable, ensure they do not impact data fidelity and are made using certified software. A2.2.4.  Ensure critical/precision measurements are only made from original GI&S products and not reproduced copy. A2.2.5.  Ensure  geopositioning  software  usage  is  IAW  this  publication.    If  Digital  Point Positioning Data Base (DPPDB) coverage does not exist, request support from NGA, through AFI14-132  23 DECEMBER 2016 35 organizational channels.  Definitions and further information related to GI&S and targeting is available at NGA’s Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) site. A2.2.6.  Targeting data mensuration is available at NGA’s SIPRNET GEOINT site. A2.2.7.  Ensure  use  of  World  Geodetic  System  1984  (WGS84)  as  the  standard  DoD reference  system  datum.    Refer  to  CJCSI  3900.01B,  Position  Reference  Procedures.    If WGS84  is  not  possible,  NGA  software  is  used  to  transform  datums  and  grids.    When operating in a CCMD area where WGS84 is not available, the CCMD commander prescribes the  interoperable  datum  to  be  used.    Additional  information  is  available  at  the  following WEB site:  http://www.nga.smil.mil/products/gandg/geotrans/. A2.2.8.  The Navigation Plan (NAVPLAN) series charts used in mission planning are likely outdated.  Actual cultural features may not look as they do on the Compressed Arc Digitized Raster  Graphics  (CADRG)-NAVPLAN  charts.    It  is  critical  that  any  replacement  for  the NAVPLAN series not sacrifice current aeronautical specifications to the detriment of flight. A2.2.9.  Many  current  vertical  obstructions  are  not  considered  accurate  to  Air  Force specification or are missing.  Make navigation allowances accordingly. A2.2.10.  State  actual  requirements  to  drive  systems  to  maximum  efficiency  rather  than requesting inferior data only because of availability. A2.3.  GI&S Requirements Submission. A2.3.1.  Area  GI&S  Requirements.    Area  GI&S  requirements  are  requirements  for  existing GI&S  products  of  a  specific  area  (e.g.,  Tactical  Pilotage  Chart  G-18  that  covers  southern Nevada). A2.3.2.  Functional  GI&S  Requirements. include requirements  for  new  or  modified  GI&S  products  and  requirements  for  existing  GI&S products  to  support  weapon  system  research,  development,  test,  initial  fielding,  and sustainment.   Functional  GI&S requirements A2.3.3.  Area  GI&S  Requirements  Submission.    IAW  CJCSI  3901.01D,  “Service  and Combatant Command GI&S Officers will identify, coordinate, validate, and prioritize GI&S requirements for their respective organization.”  AF/A2CG performs this function for the AF.  Annually,  AF/A2CG  consolidates,  prioritizes,  and  submits  all  AF  area  GI&S  production requirements  to  the  Foundation  GEOINT  NSG  Operations  Executive  using  standardized tools  and  processes  fielded  by  NGA  (e.g.,  Geospatial requirements  management Requirements One-stOp Visualization Environment [GROOVE]). A2.3.4.  Functional  GI&S  Requirements  Submission.    Annually  AF/A2CG  generates  a consolidated record identifying the AF’s current and future functional GI&S requirements, in what  formats,  on  what  domains,  and  on  what  media.    This  record  is  reviewed  by  HAF, MAJCOM, and Program Offices and then submitted to NGA every spring. A2.3.5.  Request  Management  Capability.    The  National  System  for  GEOINT  Request Management Capability (formerly the National System for GEOINT [NSG] Needs Process) is  an  enterprise  process  for  submission  and  adjudication  of  NSG  GEOINT  capability  gaps and  changes  to  programs  of  record.    NSG  Request  Management  addresses  GEOINT shortfalls in Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership, Personnel, and Facilities (DOTMLPF).  AF GEOINT collectors, users, and producers may submit capability requests 36 AFI14-132  23 DECEMBER 2016 for review, adjudication, and potential implementation  by NGA.  Any member may submit requests  into  the  NSG  request  management  capability  on  the  Joint  Worldwide  Intelligence Communication  System  (JWICS)  network  http://nsg.ic.gov/requirement.    The  AF/A2CG validates submissions.  Subsequently, an NGA Support Team member works with AF/A2CG to  ensure  understanding,  impact,  and  linkage  to  NSG  strategy.    NGA/Xperience  Customer Account Managers provide liaison throughout the adjudication process. A2.4.  GI&S requirements for new systems under development and existing systems being upgraded. A2.4.1.  Existing  capability/functional  requirement  review:    If  the  need  arises  to  review  an existing system and  requirements documentation  already  exists in  any approved form,  such as  Initial  Capabilities  Documents,  Capabilities  Development  Documents  (CDD),  Capability Production Document (CPD), System Specification, LMDP, etc., the GI&S analysis should, as a minimum, address the following questions: A2.4.1.1.  Which subsystems require geospatial data? A2.4.1.2.  Are  any  GI&S  terms  used?    To  determine  this,  perform  document  word searches for:  geospatial, geographic, Geographic Information System,  GEOINT, GI&S, GIS,  map,  chart,  geodesy,  geodetic,  geophysical,  geophysics,  NGA,  point  positioning, imagery, (for imagery-based geospatial) georectified, georeferenced, coordinates, datum, targeting,  grid,  elevation  data,  ellipsoid,  gravity,  WGS84,  WGS,  Universal  Transverse Mercator,  Inertial  Navigation  System,  Flight  Management  System,  Terrain  Awareness Warning System (TAWS), Auto Ground Collision Avoidance System. A2.4.1.3.  Does  the  use  of  a  GI&S  term  relate  to  a  GI&S  requirement?    Analyze  word search results for GI&S requirements.  Understand the purpose and goals of the existing system.  Correct  and amplify requirement as necessary using the following questions to ensure all relevant information is included. A2.4.2.  To  develop  a  new  operational  capability  that  involves  GI&S,  it  is  important  to understand  the  purpose  of  the  system  being  developed.    Begin  by  reviewing  the  system’s concept of operations (CONOPS), Analysis of Alternatives report, or similar documentation.  Conduct  a  mission  decomposition  to  determine  key  mission  areas  and  any  requisite geospatial inputs/outputs.  Some early questions include: A2.4.2.1.  What is/are the key mission(s) supported by the system? A2.4.2.2.  What functions does the weapon, weapon system, or AIS support? A2.4.2.3.  Who are the end users? A2.4.2.4.  Must the system supply essential elements of information (EEIs) derived from or related to the GI&S inputs? A2.4.2.5.  Is  there  an  intelligence  function  or  customer  who  receives  input  from  the system? A2.4.3.  Ensure the program or initiative follows the guidance in AFI 14-111, and AFMC/A2 management  of  Acquisition  Intelligence  Processes  (e.g.,  Intelligence  Support  Working Groups  [ISWG],  Technical  Exchange  Meetings  [TEM],  and  Cross-  Program  Analysis).  Ensure  the  program  is  conducting  GI&S  analysis  in  other  acquisition  processes  such  as AFI14-132  23 DECEMBER 2016 37 systems  engineering,  risk  analysis/management,  test  and  evaluation  planning,  and  cost  and manpower estimates.  Ensure that documented requirements are consistent with the baseline documents of the initiative or program. A2.4.4.  It  is  not  essential  that  the  requirement  writer  have  an  in-depth  background  in geospatial sciences.  Assistance or clarification should be requested through GI&S channels whenever necessary. A2.4.5.  What  are  the  GI&S  inputs  to  the  system  (i.e.,  data,  products,  digital  or  hardcopy formats, various media)?  Perform analysis to ensure the latest and best standard geospatial data  and  products  are  being  used  to  support  the  functions  served.    Consider  such  facts  as update cycles (timeliness), accuracy factors,  readability related to  colors and lighting, input availability/distribution  at  various  levels  of  command  and  geographic  areas  in  which coverage  is  needed,  storage  within  the  Geospatial  Product  Library  (GPL)  data  structure, scales, resolution, and any other relevant  factors that appear in this publication.  Make sure that  standard  products  selected  for  use  by  the  program  or  initiatives  are  not  on  the  NGA “Sunset” or “Soon to be obsolete” lists.  Answer the following: A2.4.5.1.  Are data/product format(s) compatible with system interface requirements?  If applicable, ensure that requirements specify all GI&S-related interfaces that are needed. A2.4.5.2.  Will  system  software  properly  manipulate  geospatial  information?    Has software  output  been  verified  to  ensure  no  change  to  basic  accuracy  is  caused  by  the software?  If necessary, request assistance through normal channels. A2.4.5.3.  Does  the  requirement  indicate  a  need  for  transformation  to  new  NGA map/chart environments?  If so, state that future system changes will be necessary to go from legacy GI&S data/products to the new digital programs. A2.4.5.4.  What are the sources of the inputs (NGA, AF production, etc.)?  If sources are other  than  NGA,  such  as  native  maps  or  Canadian  maps  and  charts,  secure  Air  Staff waivers. A2.4.5.5.  Are  there  any  proprietary  components  that  result  from  vendor  actions  to repackage  and  control  standard  products  and  data?    When  in  doubt,  seek  assistance through  normal  channels,  and  ensure  the  use  of  standard,  non-proprietary  NGA  data whenever possible. A2.4.6.  Are  any  GI&S-related  materials,  such  as  TMs  or  imagery,  required?    The  term GEOINT covers materials outside of the AF definition of GI&S.  GEOINT components such as imagery and imagery intelligence should be cross-referenced. A2.4.7.  Are geodetic or precise coordinates used by the system? A2.4.7.1.  Is  the  source  for  coordinate  derivation  DPPDB?    If  another  source  is  used, request Air Staff approval. A2.4.7.2.  Is  NGA  point  positioning  support  needed?    If  so,  contact  AF/A2CG  via  the GI&S chain of command. A2.4.7.3.  Is  specialized  software  required  to  obtain  precise  points?    If  so,  this  software must be NGA-approved. 38 AFI14-132  23 DECEMBER 2016 A2.4.7.4.  Is  the  new  system  used  for  Targeting?    If  so,  document  that  fact  in  the requirement  and  perform  analysis  to  ensure  that  system  accuracies  meet  the  specific targeting requirements. A2.4.7.5.  If Coordinate-Seeking Weapons (CSW) are to be supported, request assistance from  AF/A2CG  through  the  chain  of  command  to  ensure  you  have  the  current  CSW checklists. A2.4.7.6.  Is GI&S data stored on airborne platforms used for coordinate derivation?  If so,  ensure  entire  data  extraction  and  loading  processes  are  outlined  in  detail  as  derived requirements. A2.4.7.7.  Has  appropriate  linkage  between  derived  requirements  and  applicable  sensor models been documented in the requirements verbiage? A2.4.7.8.  If  coordinate  transformation  will  be  performed,  ensure  NGA  GEOTRANS  is used to conduct the transformation. A2.4.7.9.  Assess  the  relationships  among  this  system  and  systems  that  acquire,  process and  pass  intelligence  information,  (e.g.,  Distributed  Ground  System  and  Air  and  Space Operations Center (AOC) weapon systems)?  Do these relationships lead to any derived requirements  (e.g.,  tailoring  data  and  information  to  better  match  the  formats  and requirements of other systems)? A2.4.7.10.  If  known,  identify  the  potential  similarities  between  source  data  for  this system and data for similar platforms, (e.g., the F-22A need for digital terrain elevation data that might  be related to  the same general  need in  the Joint Strike Fighter or C-130 programs).  Are any economies of effort possible from cross-program analysis? A2.4.7.11.  Do  any  relationships  exist  between  this  set  of  requirements  and  the requirements  of  other  weapons  (e.g.,  Guided  Bomb  Unit,  GBU-31)?    Are  there  any derived requirements? A2.4.7.12.  Has a requirement for Height Above Ellipsoid (HAE) and/or Mean Sea Level (MSL) data been identified? A2.4.7.13.  What  type  of  elevation  data  best  serves  this  system?    Have  Shuttle  Radar Topography  Mission  (SRTM),  various  Digital  Terrain  Elevation  Data  (DTED®),  High Resolution Terrain Information (HRTI) levels, DPPDB and stereo-derived elevation data been considered? A2.4.7.14.  What type of controlled imagery best serves this system?  Have commercial orthorectified  or  Controlled  Image  Base  (CIB®)  been  considered?    Include  desired resolution, format and type (panchromatic, multispectral, pan-sharpened, etc. A2.4.7.15.  Does  precise  coordinate  generation  require  training  and  certification?    AFI 14-126,  Target  Coordinate  Mensuration  Training,  Qualification  and  Certification Program can be used to help make this determination. A2.4.8.  Is WGS 84 specified in the requirement?  If another datum is to be used, check the authorization  and  ensure  NGA-validated  GEOTRANS  is  used  for  any  datum  or  grid transformations.   No other methods are authorized.   Note:  The use of WGS  84 is  strongly recommended by CJCSI 3900.01B and AF/A2CG. AFI14-132  23 DECEMBER 2016 39 A2.4.9.  What  scale  or  resolution  levels  are  required  by  this  system?    Can  they  be  met  by existing data/product sources?  Regardless of product/data availability, if the mission requires specific scales, state them in the requirement.  Relate legacy products to feature data density levels. A2.4.10.  It is necessary to understand the accuracies and limitations of legacy products.  If legacy  products  are  outdated,  and  system/mission  profile  requires  the  latest  data,  including Vertical  Obstructions,  can  the  mission  material  be  augmented  by  imagery  sources  such  as special  CIB®  production  and/or  any  future  feature  data  available  at  the  proper  densities?  Regardless of data and product availability, state actual requirements to drive the system to maximum efficiency. A2.4.11.  Is  the  age  of  information  or  specific  timeliness  required  and  specified  in  the requirement? A2.4.12.  Are  there  specialized  mission  planning  system  considerations?   Describe relationships  to  mission  planning  (i.e.,  are  mission  planning  systems  that  serve  this  system capable of ingesting all required data, including data from future NGA programs?). A2.4.13.  Are there any relationships to “standard” GI&S and GIS software applications for visualization  and  manipulation  of  GI&S  data  and  products,  (e.g.,  CJMTK)?    Does  the  new system have a need to change or add requirements to specific software programs?  Are other GI&S  packages  used  with  this  system?    Notify  AF/A2CG  of  any  new  GIS  application requirements. A2.4.14.  Are  accuracy  requirements  for  the  GI&S  data  and  products  specified  in  the requirement?  Specific accuracies are stated for most NGA and other products.  If avionics or system  components  can  use  materials  with  greater  accuracy  to  enhance  performance,  those accuracies should be stated in the requirement. A2.4.15.  If applicable, state special needs for information from new NGA chart production or other related new programs: A2.4.15.1.  1:500K scale and smaller equivalent A2.4.15.2.  1:250K scale equivalent. A2.4.15.3.  1:100K to 1:50K scale equivalent. A2.4.15.4.  1:25K scale and larger equivalent; A2.4.16.  Is  the  geographic  area  of  systems  operations  specified  for  translation  into geospatial  Area  Requirements  when  applicable?    Ensure  the  area  requirement  is  submitted through the chain of command to AF/A2CG for training and RDT&E purposes.  When data is required for use in supporting Operational Plan (OPLAN) commitments, the requirements are submitted to the appropriate CCMD component. A2.4.17.  To  assist  end  users,  state  any  special  classification  or  caveats  associated  with specific GI&S materials.  This includes program restrictions for mission planning and related systems.    It  also  includes  any  special  distribution  caveats,  such  as  those  required  by  NGA bilateral country agreements and NGA “LIMITED DISTRIBUTION” restrictions. A2.4.18.  Can the current AF or NGA GPL be used to supply the standard suite of materials or specialized materials? 40 AFI14-132  23 DECEMBER 2016 A2.4.18.1.  What  security  restrictions  exist  for  the  GPL  in  the  geographic/command environment of the system? A2.4.18.2.  Can specialized communications such as Global Broadcast System (GBS) be used in this support? A2.4.18.3.  Make note of frequency of updates required for GPL-based information  and any other data sources. A2.4.18.4.  Are there any systems/architectures outside of GPL that are required to store and  disseminate  inputs  for  this  system,  (e.g.,  Joint  Intelligence  Virtual  Architecture-Visualization (JIVA-V), etc.)? A2.4.19.  If  GPL  is  not  used,  are  specialized  distribution  networks  required  for  input  of geospatial information, or will standard Defense Logistics Agency distribution support fulfill the need? A2.4.20.  What  are  the  digital  data  formats  required  by  the  system?    Are  these  formats compatible  with  current  NGA  formats  and  projected  future  developments  foreseen  for  this material?  Every effort should be made to  ensure the system uses standard NGA geospatial data to ensure interoperability and compatibility with operational architectures. A2.4.21.  If  the  system  produces  GI&S  data/updates  for  “upstream”  dissemination  are  the specified formats compatible with current geospatial standards? A2.4.22.  Is  special  seasonal  coverage  or  any  other  special  attribute  to  standard  geospatial data and products specified?  For example, is seasonal CIB® coverage required? A2.4.23.  Are  there  any  softcopy  or  special  digital  formats  required,  such  as  data compression? A2.4.24.  Do  any  geodesy  or  geophysical  relationships  exist,  such  as  those  requiring specialized  surveys  to  conduct  operations?    If  so,  contact  AF/A2CG  for  additional information as needed. A2.4.25.  Are  there  requirements  for  related  geospatial  materials  outside  of  AF/A2CG responsibility, such as evasion charts, flight information publications or Common Installation Picture  information?    If  so,  they  should  be  identified  respectively  to  the  Joint  Personnel Recovery  Agency,  Air  Force  Flight  Standards  Agency  or  AF/A4C  installation  geospatial materials POC. A2.4.26.  Is  a  reproduction  policy  needed?    If  so,  has  that  been  documented?    Are  there reproduction restrictions for system output? A2.4.27.  Are  special  destruction  procedures  needed  in  addition  to  normal  classification policy? A2.4.28.  Will any specialized geospatial training be needed? A2.4.29.  Do contractors need access to geospatial data or products? A2.4.30.  Will  the  use  of  geospatial  data  by  operating  organizations  necessitate  manpower changes or generate additional training requirements?  AFI14-132  23 DECEMBER 2016 41 Attachment 3 GEODETIC SUPPORT WORKSHEET Use the recommended format below for submitting geodetic survey requirements.  Examples of required information are included.  Add more information as necessary, one worksheet for each request. A3.1.  User  Identification  Code.  Command-generated  alphanumeric  code  indicating  the command  making  the  request,  the  fiscal  year  (FY)  the  request  is  submitted  and  the  numerical value of the request for the year.
