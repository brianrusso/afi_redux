Overview.  This  manual  prescribes  the  standardized  procedures  for  implementing  and executing  Repair  Networks  (RN)  across  the  Total  Force  and  organizations  must  use  it  in conjunction  with  AFI  20-117,  Repair  Network  Integration.    Currently,  RNs  only  accomplish intermediate level inspection, maintenance, repair, and overhaul of reparable assets to fulfill the needs  of  the  Mission  Generation  Network  (MGN).    The  core  concept  of  Repair  Network Integration (RNI) is to optimize intermediate level maintenance to operate as a single, seamless repair operation that spans the AF Enterprise. 1.2.  Process Ownership.  The Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) has designated Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) as the single process owner for the repair enterprise.  As outlined in AFI  20-117,  the  AFMC  Commander  (AFMC/CC)  has  designated  the  Directorate  of  Logistics, Civil  Engineering  and  Force  Protection,  AFMC  (AFMC/A4),  as  the  responsible  authority  for executing RNI responsibilities. 1.2.1.  The  single  process  owner  for  the  AF  Repair  Enterprise  is  responsible  for  planning, operations,  and  strategy  and  examines  the  core  processes  that  impact  weapon  system availability,  including  product  flow,  funding,  repair  requirements,  repair  capability  and capacity, and associated information technology (IT) products. 1.2.2.  Repair  network  management  is  a  process-focused  effort  designed  to  improve  repair efficiency, effectiveness, and weapon system availability.  1.3.  Scope  of  Applicability.  This  publication  establishes  the  requirement  to  pursue  an optimized  Total  Force  repair  enterprise.    Within  this  AFMAN  and  the  RNI  concept,  Precision Measurement  Equipment  Laboratory  (PMEL)  calibration  is  equivalent  to  repair.    RN  concepts apply to all organic repair actions under AF management.  1.4.  Governance.  RNI  utilizes  a  collaborative  approach  under  the  concept  of  Direct  Liaison Authorized.    Under  this  concept,  MAJCOMs  authorize  Product  Repair  Managers  (PRMs)  and Repair  Network  Managers  (RNMs)  to  directly  consult  and  coordinate  with  Node  Managers (NMs) to accomplish RNI actions.  PRMs, RNMs, MAJCOMs, and NMs use this collaborative relationship  to  streamline  RNI  communications  and  operations;  it  does  not  circumvent  the traditional chain of command.  1.4.1.  PRMs  and  RNMs  must  coordinate  and  gain  MAJCOM  approval  for  any  operational adjustments  requiring  the  movement  of  network  resources  (personnel,  equipment,  funding, etc.).  (T-2).  1.4.2.  RNMs are authorized to temporarily shift workload IAW this AFMAN, MAJCOM or AFMC  Center  supplements,  and/or  Memorandums  of  Agreement/Memorandums  of Understanding  (MOAs/MOUs)  established  IAW  AFI  25-201,  Intra-service,  Intra-agency, and Inter-agency Support Agreement Procedures.   1.4.3.  For each RN, MOAs/MOUs between MAJCOMs will delegate authority to RNMs to coordinate  the  temporary  reallocation  of  workload.    MOAs/MOUs  will  detail  how  RN personnel  execute  changes  in  allocation  of  maintenance  repairs.    If  existing  policies  and AFMAN20-118  27 OCTOBER 2015 5 processes  sufficiently  outline  network  requirements,  a  MOA/MOU  is  not  required.  MOAs/MOUs must be in place no later than 30 days prior to Product Repair Group (PRG) initial operational capability (IOC).  Note: Permanent reallocation of workload is a function of detailed manpower analysis and requires coordination with MAJCOM and the HQ USAF Directorate of Manpower, Personnel and Services (AF/A1).   1.4.3.1.  RNMs  will  not  permanently  shift  workload  unless  it  is  an  integral  part  of  an approved network redesign recommendation IAW Chapter 5 of this AFMAN. 6 AFMAN20-118  27 OCTOBER 2015 Chapter 2 COMPUTE RNI CAPABILITY AND CAPACITY (RNI CAP2) 2.1.  RNI  CAP2  Overview.  RNI  CAP2  measures  the  workforce  capability  and  physical capacity  to  conduct  repairs  at  the  node  and  is  aggregated  to  the  AF  repair  enterprise.    Repair nodes  own  and  maintain  RNI  CAP2  data  within  Logistics  Installations  and  Mission  Support-Enterprise  View/Repair  Network  View  (LIMS-EV/RNV).    RNI  CAP2  is  a  required  input  to workload  planning  and  the  assessment  of  network  performance.    Key  elements  of  RNI  CAP2 include: 2.1.1.  Capability.  The number of direct-touch man-hours that node personnel are available to complete repairs.  Capability may decrease due to non-direct touch task commitments. 2.1.2.  Capacity.    Equipment,  physical  infrastructure,  or  facilities  available  to  complete repairs.    Capacity  may  decrease  due  to  equipment  malfunctions,  cross-utilization  of equipment by another network, etc. 2.1.3.  Potential  Throughput.    The  normal  day-to-day  ability  of  a  repair  node  to  complete repairs.    For  rules  governing  how  RNI  CAP2/Potential  Throughput  is  calculated  see Attachment 2 of this manual.  2.2.  RNM CAP2 Responsibilities.  RNMs will: 2.2.1.  Develop  standard  business  rules  for  their  respective  network(s)  for  reporting  RNI CAP2  (e.g.,  identify  whether  administrative  tasks  will  be  consolidated  as  one  task  or separated individually within LIMS-EV/RNV).  (T-3). 2.2.1.1.  Air Force Metrology and Calibration (AFMETCAL) Program Office defines the standard business for the PMEL network.  2.2.2.  Initiate data call for RNI CAP2 from each repair node IAW AFI 20-117.  (T-2). 2.2.3.  Compile,  aggregate,  and  analyze  RNI  CAP2  data  to  determine  the  total  repair requirement the network can effectively support.  (T-2). 2.2.4.  Ensure RNI CAP2 data integrity and completeness.  (T-2). 2.2.5.  Monitor  RNI  CAP2  for  changes  in  available  man-hours  and  constraining  assets  that may require the reallocation of workload.  (T-2). 2.2.5.1.  Ensure NMs complete training requirements IAW Chapter 7 of this manual.  (T-3). 2.3.  NM CAP2 Responsibilities.  NMs will: 2.3.1.  Input RNI CAP2 data into LIMS-EV/RNV after initial data call by RNM and update RNI CAP2 every 90 days or as changes occur.  (T-2).  2.3.2.  Contact the AFMC RNI Program Office Division (AFMC/A4L) if RNI CAP2 cannot be entered into LIMS-EV/RNV.  (T-2). 2.3.3.  Enter PMEL RNI CAP2 data into Metrology Web (METWEB).  (T-2). AFMAN20-118  27 OCTOBER 2015 7 2.3.4.  Coordinate  RNI  CAP2  changes  with  their  respective  MAJCOM/A4,  Maintenance Group (MXG) leadership, and RNM as required.  (T-2). 2.3.5.  Validate RNI CAP2 integrity and completeness IAW AFI 20-117.  (T-2). 2.3.6.  Complete all required training IAW Chapter 7 of this manual.  (T-3).  2.4.  Organizations  without  Backshop  Repair  Capability.  In  some  cases,  centralized  repair will result in removal of backshop repair capability from some units.  In those cases, units are not required to update LIMS-EV/RNV capability data.  However, the unit commander must appoint a responsible agent to verify and update LIMS-EV/RNV capacity data.  (T-3). 8 AFMAN20-118  27 OCTOBER 2015 Chapter 3 WORKLOAD PLANNING 3.1.  Workload  Planning  Overview.  Workload  planning repair requirements  into  projected  workloads  and  allocating  the  projected  work  across  repair  nodes based on RNI CAP2.  MAJCOMs, RNMs and NMs complete this proactive process prior to the execution year to ensure efficient and effective repair execution.  The degree to which workload can be forecasted and allocated will vary between networks.  forecasting involves 3.2.  Collaboration Meetings.  All networks should integrate stakeholder collaboration meetings into existing supply chain forums/current workload planning processes.  3.2.1.  Applicable  MAJCOM  Functional  Managers  (MFMs)  will  participate  in  network collaboration meetings, inform MAJCOM/A4s of workload concerns, and provide MAJCOM approval on workload plans when necessary.   3.2.2.  PRMs  will  support  RNMs  by  determining  key  stakeholders,  participating  in collaboration  meetings;  monitoring  PRG  performance,  force  projection  changes  and  budget constraints; and providing strategic-level guidance.  (T-3). 3.3.  RNM Workload Planning Responsibilities.  RNMs will: 3.3.1.  Establish and lead collaboration meetings.  (T-2).  3.3.2.  Forecast and allocate workload as applicable to their network.  (T-2).  3.3.3.  Monitor the network by comparing planned production against actual production and consider/identify RNI CAP2 excess or shortfalls.  (T-2). 3.3.4.  Input workload plans in LIMS-EV/RNV for Propulsion networks.  (T-2). 3.4.  NM Workload Planning Responsibilities.  NMs will: 3.4.1.  Participate  in  collaboration  meetings  to  identify  and  communicate  issues  that  may affect repair execution with MFMs, RNMs, and other repair network stakeholders.  (T-2).  3.4.2.  Communicate  repair  enterprise  issues  that  may  affect  node  repair  execution  to  local chain-of-command.  (T-2). 3.4.3.  Develop  prioritized  production  schedules  to  execute  workload  planning  and implement production changes agreed upon by the MFMs and RNMs.  (T-2).   3.4.3.1.  NMs  for  commodity  Centralized  Repair  Facility  (CRF)  locations  will  use  the Execution and Prioritization of Repairs Support System (EXPRESS) Web Toolkit.  (T-2). 3.4.4.  Communicate  with  host  Logistics  Readiness  Squadron  (LRS)  to  identify  supply supportability issues and elevate to MFMs/RNMs. (T-2). 3.4.5.  Elevate  awaiting  parts  (AWP)  issues  to  MFMs/RNMs  IAW  AFI  23-101,  Air  Force Materiel Management.  (T-2). 3.5.  Repair  Aggregation  and  Prioritization.  Aggregation  requires  the  use  of  available  IT systems/databases  and  stakeholder  input  to  obtain  current  reparable  requirements  within  the network.    Prioritization  requires  the  use  of  business  rules  to  repair  intermediate  level  assets  in AFMAN20-118  27 OCTOBER 2015 9 order  of  precedence  to  meet  changing  enterprise  needs.    RNM  involvement  in  aggregating  and prioritizing repairs will vary between PRGs.  3.5.1.  RNMs  for  commodity  networks  will  use  stakeholder  input,  LIMS-EV,  and/or available IT systems/databases.  (T-2). 3.5.2.  RNMs  for  PMEL  networks  will  use  PMEL  Automated  Management  System (PAMS)/Facilities and Equipment Maintenance (FEM) and METWEB.  (T-2). 3.5.3.  RNMs  for  propulsion  networks  will  use  a  combination  of  actuarial  data  and coordination with the MAJCOMs and RNs.  (T-2). 3.6.  Temporary  Workload  Reallocation.  RNMs  are  the  focal  point  for  facilitating  an  agile network response when repair nodes are unable to accommodate current repair requirements or if standard  prioritization  processes  do  not  adequately  meet  the  needs  of  the  dynamic  repair environment.  RNMs are authorized to shift workload as outlined in Chapter 1.  RNMs will:  3.6.1.  Communicate and collaborate with appropriate stakeholders and work to resolve gaps between  required  workload  and  RNI  CAP2  through  the  reallocation  of  work  or  the movement of additional resources.  (T-2). 3.6.2.  Coordinate  with  Air  Force  Life  Cycle  Management  Center  (AFLCMC)  or  Air  Force Sustainment Center (AFSC) as applicable, MFMs, and repair nodes IAW established MOAs, MAJCOM supplements, and this manual.  (T-2).  MAJCOMs must approve all reallocation plans/actions. 3.6.3.  Reallocate  workload  within  existing  budget  appropriations  and  address  funding requirements  introduced  in  Chapter  4  of  this  manual.    (T-2).    This  may  include  but  is  not limited to overtime, funding for Air Reserve Component (ARC) resources, Temporary Duty (TDY) travel, and/or transportation. 3.6.4.  Weigh the cost of additional time and transportation against the benefit of reallocating workload.  (T-2). 3.6.5.  Focus  reallocation  decisions  on  network  efficiency;  however,  always  consider  the impact to the network’s ability to meet wartime requirements.  (T-2).  10 AFMAN20-118  27 OCTOBER 2015 Chapter 4 PROGRAMMING AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 4.1.  Overview.  The following chapter outlines RNI transportation funding guidance that RNMs and MAJCOMs must consider during workload reallocation planning.  MAJCOMs must use the guidance  in  this  chapter  in  conjunction  with  AFI  25-201  to  determine  funding  and  general reimbursement requirements  during temporary workload reallocation planning.  This  chapter is not all-inclusive and MAJCOMs/units must contact their respective Financial Management staff for questions related to transfer of funds between different appropriations.  4.2.  Second  Destination  Transportation  (SDT).  AFMC  will  fund  reparable  shipments  to Centralized  Repair  Facilities  (CRFs)  IAW  AFI  65-601,  Volume  1,  Budget  Guidance  and Procedures. 4.2.1.  RNMs, NMs, and LRS organizations must use Transportation Account Codes (TAC) for RNI shipments IAW AFI 24-203, Preparation and Movement of Air Force Cargo.  (T-2).  See at https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/OO-LG-TR-A7/OO-LG-TR-A2/default.aspx  for  a  listing  of RNI TACs. TAC  Memorandum Account the SDT Centrally  Managed 4.2.2.  The RNM will submit a consolidated RNI SDT forecast, using prior year(s) TAC data as a baseline, through AFMC/A4L to the Air Force SDT Centrally Managed Account (CMA) Program Manager in the 635 Supply Chain Operations Wing (SCOW).  (T-2). 4.2.3.  PRMs must make requests for new TACs (if required for existing or new PRGs) via the  TAC  Request  function  in  Tracker  Lite  (https://trackerlite.wpafb.af.mil/LTS/)  in coordination with the SDT CMA Program Office.  (T-2).  4.3.  Manpower  Appropriation.  RNI  workload  reallocation  decisions  may  affect  multiple manpower  and  funding  appropriations.    These  appropriations  include  ANG  Operation  and Maintenance  (O&M),  ANG  Personnel,  AFRC  O&M,  AFRC  Reserve  Personnel  Account,  Air Force  Special  Operations  Command  (AFSOC)  Major  Force  Program  11,  Federal  Research  & Development  (R&D),  and  Active  Duty.    Using  personnel  in  different  appropriation  codes requires preplanning and is restricted after Congress appropriates funding in a fiscal year.  Using resources in one appropriation when another appropriation is funded for that purpose may create an Anti-Deficiency Act Violation.  Moving appropriation funding is not possible if it contradicts the purpose of the appropriation.   4.3.1.  Moving  unplanned  and  nonrecurring  workload  between  different  appropriated workforces  in  the  execution  year  generally  does  not  require  reimbursement  for  manpower.  Network  managers  generally  cannot  use  ARC-funded  workforce.    ARC  personnel  may perform unplanned, non-recurring, and non-routine work as long as they volunteer and it is incidental to, or part of, the ARC mission. 4.3.1.1.  PRMs/RNMs requiring the use of ARC personnel must consult and comply with AFI 36-2619, Military Personnel Appropriation (MPA) Man-Day Program.  (T-2).  4.3.1.2.  When  an  ARC  member  is  provided  MPA  man-days  in  support  of  workload reallocation  or  other  RNI  support,  the  associated  travel  and  per  diem  fund  cite  must  be provided by the requesting MAJCOM or the unit being supported.  AFMAN20-118  27 OCTOBER 2015 11 4.3.2.  Repair  node  support  from  AFSOC  or  R&D authorization and coordination with fund holders. locations  requires  appropriate 4.4.  Repair Costs and Rates.  For the purposes of RNI repair costs and rates, efficiencies refer to costs involving operating expenses and capital investment.  4.4.1.  Current  and  projected  repair  costs  must  be  estimated,  but  are  based  on  labor, infrastructure, transportation costs, and operating stock usage. 4.4.1.1.  Labor  costs  are  based  on  labor  dedicated  to  the  RN  and  any  direct  overhead.  Use RNI CAP2 to determine available hours for the RN and determine labor rates in AFI 65-503, US Air Force Cost and Planning Factors. 4.4.1.2.  Infrastructure costs are based on the size and energy requirements for the repair node.  NMs should contact local Civil Engineering Squadron for assistance. 4.4.1.3.  Transportation  costs  are  based  on  the  Joint  Transportation  Requirements  Tool (JTRT), which is part of the Logistics Tool Suite.  This tool is used primarily by USAF Transportation  Managers  to  manage  USAF  logistics,  transportation,  and  financial functions. 4.4.1.4.  Current and projected contract costs depend on contract negotiations. 4.4.1.5.  One-time requirements and costs for additional spares will be determined by the AFMC  Directorate  of  Strategic  Plans,  Programs,  Requirements  and  Analyses (AFMC/A5/8/9). 4.4.1.6.  One-time requirements and costs for new construction or equipment transfers are dependent of needs. 4.5.  Reimbursement  for  Workload.  When  a  source  of  repair  (SOR)  or  repair  node  requires reimbursement,  special  business  rules  may  apply.    MAJCOMs  must  consider  the  initial Congressional appropriation when a node/network exhausts RNI CAP2 and needs to send repairs to  other  nodes/networks.    Typically,  shifting  SORs  for  assets  supporting  activities  funded  by different  appropriations  requires  reimbursement  or  a  funding  source.    MAJCOMs  must  outline cross-appropriation  reimbursement  requirements  in  MOAs/MOUs,  Depot  Maintenance  Inter-service Support Agreement (DMISA), or other contract form as required. 12 AFMAN20-118  27 OCTOBER 2015 Chapter 5 NETWORK PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT (NPA) AND NETWORK REDESIGN 5.1.  Process Overview.  NPA is an evaluative process that focuses on developing performance standards,  tracking  and  assessing  network  performance  against  those  standards,  implementing corrective actions when necessary, and optimizing the network to improve efficiency (optimum performance) and effectiveness (optimum reliability, responsiveness, and agility).  NPA requires managers  to  evaluate  whether  the  network  is  fulfilling  MGN  requirements;  analyze  network performance  against  future  requirements;  implement  corrective  action  plans  if  network performance  falls  below  identified  standards;  and  when  necessary,  formulate  network  redesign options.    Network  redesign  focuses  on  optimization  of  the  network  and  is  normally  a  result  of NPA,  a  DoD/Service  initiative,  or  a  strategic  issue  (described  below)  affecting  network performance.   5.2.  PRM Performance Assessment Responsibilities.  Metrics are critical to assessing network performance,  form  the  baseline  for  improving  operations,  and  provide  a  key  data  point  for establishing network redesign recommendations.  PRMs will: 5.2.1.  Evaluate  RNs  in  terms  of  availability  and  performance.    (T-2).    Availability  metrics measure  a  network’s  ability  to  meet  repair  and  warfighter  requirements.    Performance metrics measure the performance of serviceable assets upon exiting the RN or how  the RN responds to a serviceable requirement.    5.2.2.  Establish  network  performance  goals  and  limits  (upper  and  lower)  in  collaboration with RNMs and MAJCOMs.  (T-2).  5.2.3.  Ensure commodity RNMs and NMs collect, aggregate (repair node, RN, and weapon system),  analyze,  and  distribute  metrics  identified  in  this  AFMAN  to  MAJCOM/A4s  and AFMC/A4L quarterly.  (T-2).   5.2.3.1.  Cannibalizations  (CANNs).    CANN  definition  and  procedures  are  outlined  in AFI  21-101,  Aircraft  and  Equipment  Maintenance  Management.    Users  may  access CANN metrics in LIMS-EV/WSV (Weapons Systems View). 5.2.3.2.  Issue  Effectiveness  (IE).    Issue  Effectiveness  is  the  percentage  of  orders  that units  actually  issue.    IE  is  computed  by  dividing  items  issued,  plus  items  backordered, into items issued.  Users can locate IE metrics in LIMS-EV Ad Hoc Reporting - Business Objects (BOBJ) within the "Standard Base Supply System-D002A_301M” Universe. 5.2.3.3.  Stockage  Effectiveness  (SE).    SE  measures  the  percentage  of  time  the  supply system  has  those  items  required  to  be  maintained  at  base  and  deploy  level  supply locations available for immediate sale.  Users can locate SE metrics in LIMS-EV Ad Hoc Reporting - BOBJ within the "Standard Base Supply System-D002A_301M” Universe. 5.2.3.4.  Requisitioning Objective (RO).  RO is the maximum quantity of material to be maintained on-hand and on order to sustain current operations and core war reserves.  It consists of the sum of stocks represented by the operating level, safety level, and repair cycle,  if  applicable;  the  order  and  ship  time  level;  and  authorized  additive  levels  IAW AFI 23-101.  RO fill rate is the expression of how much RO is available at a given time.  AFMAN20-118  27 OCTOBER 2015 13 Users  can  locate  RO  metrics  in  LIMS-EV  Ad  Hoc  Reporting  -  BOBJ  within  the "Standard Base Supply System-D002A_301M” Universe. 5.2.3.5.  Order Response Time (ORT).

This chapter outlines the process used to establish a PRG and its RNs.  The  PRGIP  is  a  highly  collaborative  process  that  requires  significant  engagement  with  and between key stakeholders.  The PRGIP may result from recommendations included in NPAs (see Chapter 5), and/or a BCA completed IAW AFI 65-509, Business Case Analysis, for larger RNI or  supply  chain  reengineering  initiatives.    PRGIP  focuses  on  implementation  of  approved strategies  and  PRGs  within  the  scope  of  RNI  initiatives  (see  Figure  6.1).    The  PRM  leads development  and in  collaboration/conjunction  with  affected MAJCOMs. implementation  of  PRGs 6.1.1.  The  primary  output  of  this  element  of  the  PRGIP  is  a  MAJCOM  coordinated  and approved network design. 6.1.2.  To  complete  PRG  analysis,  support  from  PSMs,  AFLCMC,  AFSC,  MAJCOMs  and DLA  is  essential.    It  is  also  essential  that  the  appropriate  PRM  identifies  an  acting  or permanent RNM prior to initiating PRG analysis.  Note: IAW AFI 20-117, AFMC/A4 must execute analysis and implementation requirements until a permanent PRM/RNM is assigned. 6.2.  AFMC/A4 Responsibilities.  AFMC/A4 will: 6.2.1.  In collaboration with MAJCOMs, identify items/commodities for inclusion in a PRG. 6.2.2.  Coordinate  with  AFLCMC/CC  and  AFSC/CC  to  assign  proposed  PRG(s)  to  the appropriate center and appoint a PRM (see Figure 6.2). 6.2.3.

A2.1.3.1.2.  Number of days worked per shift per week. A2.1.3.1.3.  Number of hours worked per shift. A2.1.4.  Military personnel are accounted for by the following skill-levels: A2.1.4.1.  3-level apprentice. A2.1.4.2.  5-level journeyman. A2.1.4.3.  7-level craftsman. A2.1.5.  Civilian equivalent skill-levels for personnel without USAF skill-level: A2.1.5.1.  Apprentice. A2.1.5.2.  Journeyman. A2.1.5.3.  Craftsman or advanced journeyman. A2.1.5.4.  For  contractor  personnel  or  field  service  teams,  the  assumption  is  that  all contractors hold a journeyman skill level. A2.1.6.  Personnel productivity.  Productivity percentages take into account tasks performed by personnel who are not accounted for in Standard Availability hours per AFI 38-201, but take away from direct touch man-hours.  The productivity percentage takes into account both non-direct touch and direct touch personnel. A2.1.6.1.  Tasks  may  be  unique  to  a  particular  node,  MAJCOM,  etc.,  but  should  be reviewed and agreed upon by the nodes chain  of command.  These are tasks performed AFMAN20-118  27 OCTOBER 2015 29 outside  the  network  (e.g.,  commander’s  calls,  safety  down  days,  administrative  tasks, etc.) A2.1.6.2.  Non-direct touch personnel will have their hours deducted as an assigned task.  A2.1.6.3.  Figure  A2  1  provides  an  example  of  how  productivity  percentage  is calculated in LIMS-EV/RNV.

A2.2.  Capacity.  Equipment, physical infrastructure, or facilities, available to complete a repair. A2.2.1.  Equipment  data  comes  from  node  CA/CRL  (Custody  Authorization/Consolidated Receipt Listing) through Air Force Equipment Management System (AFEMS). 30 AFMAN20-118  27 OCTOBER 2015 A2.2.1.3.  Constraining asset.  A constraining asset is  an equipment  asset most likely to bottleneck production if unavailable. A2.2.1.4.  Constraining  assets  may  change  from  commodity-to-commodity  within  each node. A2.2.1.5.  Constraining assets may change as equipment breaks down.  A2.2.1.3.1.  For  example,  an  avionics  test  stand  is  listed  as  constraining  asset  for  a commodity  and  a  fixture  needed  for  that  commodity  becomes  unavailable.    This causes  a  bottleneck  in  the  production  of  that  commodity  but  not  for  other commodities  utilizing  the  avionics  test  stand.    The  fixture  would  then  become  the constraining asset for the affected commodities. A2.2.2.  Calculating Capacity.  Capacity is calculated two ways: A2.2.2.1.  Raw capacity considers the capacity hours available for equipment assets. A2.2.2.2.  Maintenance  man-hour  (MMH)  capacity  considers  the  average  crew  size required to operate the equipment on a given task. A2.2.2.2.1.  Average crew size.  The average number of people that it takes to operate the repair equipment-asset during normal repair of asset being worked. A2.2.2.  2  2.    Availability  percentage.    The  percent  of  time  that  equipment-asset  is operational and available to do work.  This accounts for any downtime the equipment-asset is not available to do work, i.e., broken equipment or calibration time. A2.2.2.2.3.  Shared resource percentage.  Percent  of time that repair equipment-asset is used on the product that is being assessed.  For example, if the user is entering data for the F100-229 network at a node that also repairs another TMS, and if the engine rails are shared between them, then the user must enter the percent of time the engine rail is used on the F100-229. A2.2.2.2.4.  If the equipment is not shared with anyone, the shared resource is 100%. A2.2.3.  Production.  Production takes into account average flow days (Propulsion only) and average direct touch man-hours. A2.2.3.1.  Average  flow  days.    The  average,  or  mean,  number  of  days  it  takes  an  end-item  to  be  repaired  from  time  of  induction  to  time  ready  for  shipment/storage  as  a serviceable asset.  This calculation considers work-stoppage time. A2.2.3.2.  Average direct touch man-hours (ADTMH) or MTTR.  The number of direct-touch labor hours it takes to repair an end item (e.g., engines) or commodity.  A2.2.3.3.  Includes actual repair time of commodity.  A2.2.3.4.  Does not include downtime (e.g., awaiting maintenance or awaiting parts).   A2.2.4.  Potential  Throughput.    Potential  throughput  is  determined  by  comparing  the available hours of capability and capacity.  The comparison is made using the MMH capacity formula  to  make  a  fair  comparison  and  is  driven  heavily  by  the  average  direct  touch  man-hours.  For example, low average direct touch man-hours would result in a higher potential AFMAN20-118  27 OCTOBER 2015 31 throughput and indicate additional hours are available for production.  Potential throughput is the lesser of available capability or MMH capacity multiplied by ADTMH.  32 AFMAN20-118  27 OCTOBER 2015 Attachment 3 NETWORK PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT GUIDE A3.1.  Overview.  RNMs  should  utilize  this  guide  as  a  tool  when  conducting  a  NPA  IAW Chapter 4 of this AFMAN.  This guide is not all-inclusive and PRMs/RNMs may add assessment areas,  issue  supplemental  guidance,  and  revise  it  to  meet  assessment  needs.    Consider  the following performance assessment areas when conducting a NPA: A3.2.  Network Maturity. A3.2.1.  Has the network been FOC a minimum of 12 months? A3.2.2.  Have non-enterprise (below AF or MAJCOM) changes been in place for longer than 12 months? A3.3.  Transportation/Throughput. A3.3.1.  Has throughput kept pace with the demand for the past four quarters?   A3.3.2.  Have  transportation  lead  times  affected  MGN  demand  (e.g.,  increased  spares requirements, increased MICAPs, etc.)? A3.3.3.  Does requirements? the  current transportation infrastructure  meet  planned/future  demand A3.3.4.  Is node RNI CAP2 sufficient to meet planned throughput requirements? A3.3.5.  Are additional CRFs required to increase throughput? A3.3.6.  Are  non-CRF  locations  capable  of  sustaining  local,  and  if  necessary,  enterprise operations? A3.3.7.  Does network surge capability exist?  Is it sufficient to meet wartime requirements? A3.4.  Workload/Workforce Utilization. A3.4.1.  Has  workload  been  transferred  between  nodes?    If  so,  how  many  times  and  what primary  issues  drove  the  need  for  the  transfer  (e.g.,  equipment,  manpower,  convenience, infrastructure, etc.)? A3.4.2.  Are  current  CRF  manpower  requirements  codified  and  modeled  in  the  Logistics Composite Model. A3.4.3.  Are current LRS manpower requirements sufficient to support network operations? A3.4.4.  Were the results of the workload planning process accurate?  If not, closely analyze and conduct root cause analysis as appropriate. A3.5.  Metrics. A3.5.1.  Do  performance  metrics  indicate  a  negative  trend?    Note:    Traditionally,  analysts define a trend as a movement in a specific direction over a period of seven consecutive data points (metric measures).  However, network managers should closely analyze and conduct root cause analysis when a network experiences three consecutive negative measures.   A3.5.2.  Are current metrics realistic and achievable? AFMAN20-118  27 OCTOBER 2015 33 A3.5.3.  Have  root-cause  analyses  been  conducted  when  metrics  indicate  negative  trends?  Have  those  causes  been  elevated  when  they  affect  enterprise  operations?    What  actions  are required to resolve the causes? A3.5.4.  Should  additional  metrics  be  developed  and  tracked  at  the  enterprise,  network,  or node level?   A3.6.  Requirements Analysis. A3.6.1.  Have allocated spares and consumables kept pace with repair requirements? A3.6.2.  Have  network  repair  requirements  changed  based  on  technical  data  requirements, mission needs, supply chain changes, etc.? A3.6.3.  Based  on  production  deltas,  is  the  current  infrastructure  sufficient?    What  changes are required? A3.6.4.  Are  there  pending  requirement  changes  (e.g.,  increased  flying  hours,  additional bench-check requirements, etc.)?   A3.6.5.  Should  CRFs/units  be  allowed  additional  intermediate  repair  capabilities  to  meet production requirements? A3.7.  Costs. A3.7.1.  Have  the  costs  of  CRF  operations  changed  since  FOC?    To  what  degree  and direction?  What are the primary drivers? A3.7.2.  Have  repair  times  changed?    Have  nodes  identified  the  primary  drivers  of  any changes? A3.7.3.  Have transportation costs increased?  To what degree? A3.8.  Policy. A3.1.7.  Are  there  gaps  in  RNI  or  CRF  policy  (AFI  21-101,  AFI  23-101,  AFI  20-117, AFMAN 20-118) that have affected performance, caused delays, etc.? A3.1.8.  Are there local, Supply Chain Center, or MAJCOM policies that should be codified in departmental publications? A3.1.9.  Are components appropriately coded?  Note:  RNMs should use Technical Order 00-20-3 for baseline consideration.   A3.9.  Strategic Issues. A3.9.1.  Do  previous  RNI  performance  reports  identify/include  unresolved  network  issues that must be addressed from the corporate/strategic level? A3.9.2.  Are there pending network redesign initiatives? A3.9.3.  Are there strategic issues (see Chapter 5) affecting network performance or that may affect network performance in the future?  34 AFMAN20-118  27 OCTOBER 2015 Attachment 4 PRODUCT REPAIR GROUP (PRG) SUMMARY TEMPLATE Figure A4.1.
