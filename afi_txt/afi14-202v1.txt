Purpose.  The objective of the AFI 14-202 series is to develop and maintain a high state of mission  readiness  for  effective  execution  of  Air  Force  missions  supporting  the  full  range  of military operations.  This is done by ensuring all personnel performing intelligence duties attain and maintain the qualifications and currencies needed to support their unit's mission effectively and to the minimum standards prescribed by each community. 1.2.  Publication Structure and Hierarchy.  AFPD 14-2 mandates an intelligence qualification training  program,  standardization/evaluation  (Stan/Eval)  program  and  prescribing  of  general intelligence procedures and policies. 1.2.1.  AFI 14-202 prescribes the framework  for  unit intelligence programs  and procedures.  Specific  guidance  tailored  to  the  mission  set  or  mission  design  series  (MDS),  weapons system,  intelligence  function  or  activity,  is  further  detailed  in  applicable  AFI  14-2 publications (hereafter referred to as “AFI 14-2[MDS]”).  The AFI 14-202 publications take precedence over mission set instructions (AFI 14-2[MDS]). 1.2.2.  The  volume  structure  is  consistent  across  the  AFI  series.    AFI  14-202,  Volume  1, Intelligence Training, structures the intelligence qualification training program with AFI 14-2[MDS]  detailing  specific  knowledge  and  performance  tasks  as  well  as  the  currencies required  for  qualification  within  each  mission  set.    AFI  14-202,  Volume  2,  Intelligence Standardization/Evaluation Program, structures the intelligence Stan/Eval program with AFI 14-2[MDS]  defining  specific  evaluation  standards  and  criteria  for  ensuring  standardized qualifications  within  each  mission  set.    AFI  14-202  Volume  3,  General  Intelligence  Rules along with AFI 14-2[MDS], addresses the mission of each unit intelligence function, identify the key processes, tasks and procedures the unit requires in order to accomplish its mission.  MAJCOMs  will  determine  the  applicability  of  these  publications  for  mission  sets  not otherwise specifically addressed by published guidance. 1.3.  Applicability. 1.3.1.  The AFI 14-202 publications apply to those personnel who perform intelligence duties supporting AF operational missions at wing level and below (as defined in AFI 38-101, Air Force  Organization).    These  intelligence  activities  require  clear  guidance  and  oversight  to ensure the AF’s capability to support combatant commanders’ plans. 1.3.2.  This publication is not intended to apply to functions such as command staff, technical training  activities,  service  intelligence  production  centers,  or  acquisition  support  unless specifically  directed  by  AFI  14-2[MDS]  series  publications.    Nor  is  it  intended  to  apply  to mission sets already governed by other guidance such as non-14-series AFIs provided there is  clear and sufficient  guidance to  effectively direct  intelligence activities.  Commanders of these units may  choose to adapt  the processes contained in  AFI 14-202 for their personnel, but it is not required by this AFI series or AFPD 14-2.  MAJCOMs/FOAs will determine the applicability  of  these  publications  for  mission  sets  not  otherwise  specifically  addressed  by published guidance. AFI14-202V1  31 MARCH 2015   5  1.4.  Scope.  This  volume  describes  execution  of  the  intelligence  training  program  specific  to qualification  in  a  duty  position  within  a  unit.    The  preponderance  of  the  program  is  realized through  on-the-job  training  (OJT)  and  is  an  expansion  of  the  guidance  on  OJT  as  contained  in AFI 36-2201. 1.4.1.  AFI  14-202,  Volume  1,  Intelligence  Training  and  AFI14-2[MDS]  complement  OJT by focusing training on a specific duty position.  Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) skill level upgrade  training  as  defined  in  the  Career  Field  Education  and  Training  Plan  (CFETP) addresses  AFSC-specific  career-long  training.    Some  AFI  14-202/14-2[MDS]  tasks  overlap or  relate  to  CFETP  items.    Individual  Specialty  Training  Standard  (STS)  tasks  and knowledge  requirements  may  be  accomplished  concurrently  with  mission  qualification training (MQT) if it makes sense within the context of that training. 1.4.2.  Mission readiness level  as defined by this publication does not  determine skill  level, nor  does  rank  or  skill  level  determine  mission  ready  status.    Currency  issues  as  described herein are independent of the award/retention of an Air Force Specialty (AFS).  For guidance on these issues, consult AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted).   6  AFI14-202V1  31 MARCH 2015 Chapter 2 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.  Deputy  Chief  of  Staff  for  Intelligence,  Surveillance  and  Reconnaissance  (ISR) (AF/A2).  AF/A2 delegates the following responsibilities to AF/A2DF.  AF/A2DF will: 2.1.1.  Develop  policy  for  developing  and  conducting  qualification  programs  to  include oversight of Intelligence Formal Training Units (IFTU) and Formal Training Units (FTU), as applicable. 2.1.2.  Review  and  monitor  AFI  14-2[MDS]  volumes  and  MAJCOM  intelligence  training policies, guidance and supplements to this publication for consistency with AFI 14-202 and for structural standardization across intelligence mission sets. 2.1.3.  Designate a lead command for each intelligence mission set.  Work with MAJCOMs to determine appropriate guidance structure for positional training for emerging mission sets. 2.1.4.  Coordinate  T-1  compliance  waivers  with  lead  commands  to  ensure  awareness  of training issues faced by other MAJCOMs in order to make informed programmatic decisions. 2.2.  Lead  Command.  Lead  commands  are  responsible  for  compiling  requirements  and ensuring  consistency  across  the  mission  set.    Lead  commands  will  act  in  coordination  with  all affected MAJCOMs.  Unresolved differences between MAJCOMs will be elevated to AF/A2DF for  final  resolution.    The  term  “lead  command”  does  not  refer  to  a  particular  organizational echelon  (i.e.,  may  be  a  MAJCOM,  Field  Operating  Agency  (FOA),  Center  of  Excellence, Bureau, etc.).  In addition to their MAJCOM responsibilities, lead commands will: 2.2.1.  Author  and  manage  AFI  14-2[MDS]  to  baseline  intelligence  training  requirements across  the  mission  set.    AFI  14-2[MDS]  may  be  more  but  not  less  restrictive  than  this publication. 2.2.2.  Ensure  units  have  access  to  validated  and  benchmarked  training  materials  for  all phases of qualification training.  At a minimum, training materials will be tailorable to each intelligence  mission  set  and  include,  as  applicable:    master  question  file  (MQF),  mission scenarios (i.e. sample message traffic, tasking messages, briefing inject worksheets), baseline threat and visual recognition academics/graphics/videos. 2.2.3.  Address  training  issues  within  each  intelligence  mission  set  community  to  ensure currency and applicability of training guidance and standardized training materials.  Sponsor unit-level 'best practices' exchanges to help address training issues. 2.2.4.  Conduct  an  Intelligence Realistic Training Review Board (IRTRB) every other  year.  The  IRTRB  will  review  this  instruction;  training  programs;  and  tactics,  techniques,  and procedures for currency, applicability, compliance and effectiveness. 2.2.5.  Program for resources to ensure sustainment of existing formal IQT programs such as IFTUs and FTUs (excluding temporary duty [TDY]-to-school costs). 2.2.6.  Review  MAJCOM  waivers adjustments.  Notify AF/A2DF if these trends indicate the need to readdress existing policy. trends  and  necessary  programmatic to identify AFI14-202V1  31 MARCH 2015   7  2.3.  Lead  Command  for  Training.  The  lead  command  for  training  is  the  command  tasked with executing formal initial qualification training (IQT).  The lead command for training does not  have  to  be  the  lead  command  for  the  intelligence  mission  set  (i.e.  AETC,  ANG,  etc.,  may execute the formal course on behalf of the lead command).  The lead command for training will: 2.3.1.  Accomplish formal course reviews (FCR) at least every other year in conjunction with the  lead  command  to  ensure  formal  training  sufficiently  addresses  requirements  for qualification  training.    The  FCR  reviews  formal  IQT  programs  and  syllabi  for  currency, applicability, compliance and effectiveness. Attendees should include training representatives from  affected  commands,  curriculum  developers, training  and standardization  offices,  and  selected  unit  subject  matter  experts.    When  possible,  schedule FCRs in conjunction with an IRTRB to minimize travel cost and maximize participation. schools, formal 2.3.2.  Establish student progress review procedures and outline processes to address student elimination when students fail to progress. 2.3.3.  Ensure  adequate  resourcing  for  sustainment  of  existing  formal  IQT  programs (excluding temporary duty [TDY]-to-school costs).  MAJCOM increases in requirements of existing courses will be responsible for providing additional funding to cover the additional costs. 2.4.  MAJCOM Directors of Intelligence (A2).  MAJCOM/A2s are responsible for the overall management  of  the  command's  intelligence  training  program.    The  role  of  the  MAJCOM/A2 training function is to provide guidance for intelligence training, ensure units have the materials needed to standardize training, and assist units in conducting their training programs.  The NGB Directorate of Intelligence (NGB/A2) also has these responsibilities and is included as part of the general title MAJCOM/A2 for this publication.  MAJCOM/A2s will: 2.4.1.  Coordinate  with  lead  commands  to  establish  and  maintain  standardized  minimum training  requirements  and  supporting  training  materials  necessary  to  meet  expected  unit taskings. 2.4.2.  Ensure  guidance  is  developed  for  units  without  published  AFI  14-2[MDS]  series instructions. 2.4.3.  Track subordinate unit waiver  requests  and coordinate  with  lead  commands to  allow programmatic adjustments. 2.4.4.  Consolidate  unit  reporting  of  personnel  exceeding  allowable  timelines  and  notify AF/A2DF on an annual basis. 2.5.  Senior  Intelligence  Officer  (SIO).  The  SIO  is  defined  as  the  Airman  responsible  for intelligence  functions  and  operations  within  an  organization.    Unless  otherwise  directed  by  the Wing  Commander,  this  is  the  highest-ranking  AF  Airman  within  the  organization  that  has:  1) been awarded an AF intelligence Specialty Code or civilian occupational series and 2) is serving in an AF intelligence position.  This position is synonymous with the Chief of Wing Intelligence (CWI),  where  applicable.    Installations  with  intelligence  activities  in  different  chains  of command have separate SIOs, each responsible for the intelligence functions and operations (or activities)  of  their  units,  accountable  to  their  commander  and  inspectable  by  their  respective MAJCOM Inspector General.  The SIO will:   8  AFI14-202V1  31 MARCH 2015 2.5.1.  Establish  and  maintain  a  qualification  training  program.    The  program  does  not obviate supervisor responsibilities IAW AFI 36-2201.  If no AFI14-2[MDS] exists develop a local qualification training program consistent with the AFI 14-202 framework and capture in local written guidance.  (T-1) 2.5.2.  Ensure  the  review  of  training  records  for  newly-assigned  intelligence  personnel,  and those completing formal training, to determine required training.  (T-2) 2.5.3.  Designate the mission readiness level (Combat Mission Ready (CMR)/Basic Mission Capable (BMC)) associated with each intelligence position.  Determine how many and which intelligence personnel are to carry specialized qualifications.  Ensure Individual Mobilization Augmentees (IMA) maintain at least BMC status.  (T-1) 2.5.4.  Ensure qualification trainers are qualified and current in areas on which they provide instruction.  (T-1) 2.5.5.  Ensure  trainees  work  under  the  direct  supervision  of  qualified  and  current  personnel when  required  to  participate  in  operational  events  or  perform  tasks  for  which  they  are  not qualified and current.  (T-2) 2.5.6.  Participate in crosstalk with other unit SIOs and MAJCOM/A2 training organizations on  the  defined  standardized  training  requirements.    Provide  feedback  on  lead  command-validated training materials; discuss applicability of emergent training tools, techniques and procedures.    Identify  changes  in  requirements  and  potential  training  opportunities  to MAJCOM/A2.  Participate in unit-level 'best practices' exchanges for intelligence personnel training.  (T-3) 2.5.7.  Ensure  individuals’  qualification  training  records  are  forwarded  upon  change  of station or assignment to assist the gaining unit in assessing current qualifications and training requirements.  (T-2) 2.6.  Qualification Training Program Manager.  The Qualification Training Program Manager is  responsible  for  overseeing  accomplishment  and  documentation  of  qualification,  specialized and  continuation  training  as  well  as  the  Ready  Intelligence  Program  by  unit  personnel.    The Program Manager will: 2.6.1.  Develop  and  manage  an  intelligence  qualification  training  program.    Use  lead command-validated  training  materials,  as  available,  modifying  these  baseline  training materials  to  meet  unit  needs.    Design  training  programs  to  achieve  the  highest  degree  of mission readiness consistent with operational and contingency requirements.  (T-2) 2.6.2.  Ensure assigned intelligence personnel attain and maintain the mission readiness level determined  by  the  SIO.    Monitor  intelligence  personnel  currencies  and  requirements  and notify/coordinate with individual’s chain-of-command on all training issues.  (T-2) 2.6.3.  Provide a written assessment of the intelligence training program to the SIO at the end of each training cycle IAW local procedures.  (T-3) 2.7.  Qualification Trainers will: 2.7.1.  Meet trainer requirements outlined in AFI 36-2201.  (T-2) 2.7.2.  Maintain qualification and currency in the areas being trained.  (T-2) AFI14-202V1  31 MARCH 2015   9  2.8.  Intelligence  Personnel.  In  addition  to  trainee  responsibilities  detailed  in  AFI  36-2201, personnel are responsible for maintaining qualification(s) and currency in assigned unit mission IAW  this  publication,  AFI  14-2[MDS]  and  applicable  AF/MAJCOM/Unit  training  standards.  (T-2)  Intelligence personnel will also: 2.8.1.  Notify supervisor of any issues that affect the completion of training events or affect mission readiness levels.  (T-3) 2.8.2.  Ensure  qualification  training  records  are  received  by  gaining  unit  when  changing station  or  assignment  to  assist  the  gaining  unit  in  assessing  qualification/training requirements.  (T-2)   10  AFI14-202V1  31 MARCH 2015 Chapter 3 QUALIFICATION TRAINING PROGRAM STRUCTURE 3.1.  Training  structure.  Intelligence  qualification  training,  consisting  of  initial  qualification training  (IQT)  and  mission  qualification  training  (MQT),  follows  a  building  block  approach  to mission qualification.  After completion of MQT, continuation training (CT) ensures up-to-date knowledge,  skills  and  abilities  of  intelligence  personnel.    Specialized  training  (ST)  addresses additional  intelligence  tasks  required  by  some  positions  above  and  beyond  the  baseline  MQT requirements. 3.1.1.  Initial  Qualification  Training.    IQT  begins  upon  entry  into  a  mission  set.    IQT establishes a foundational set of skills common across a mission set, without focusing on any unit's specific mission execution. 3.1.1.1.  IFTU  course  attendance  is  the  primary  method  of  completing  IQT.    The  lead command  may  identify  and  leverage  other  formal  courses  in  lieu  of  or  in  addition  to  a mission-specific  IFTU  when  necessary  to  meet  IQT  requirements.    These  formal  IQT courses have been coordinated and approved by the lead command to ensure standardized baseline training for all similar units across the Air Force. 3.1.1.2.  In-unit IQT may be authorized by the lead command.  In cases where mandated formal  course  quotas  are  not  available,  units  will  conduct  in-unit  IQT  using  the  current formal courseware.  (T-2) 3.1.1.3.  Lead commands will define the method by which IQT is accomplished for each mission set in the applicable AFI 14-2[MDS]. 3.1.2.  Mission  Qualification  Training.    MQT  applies  specific  unit  and  mission  context  to those  skills  gained  in  IQT  and  leads  to  qualification  of  intelligence  personnel  as  mission ready to perform tasks at their unit in their assigned position.  MQT is a unit program which includes  all  unique  local  area  procedures  and  ensures  trainees  are  able  to  demonstrate knowledge  and  task  performance  proficiency.    The  applicable  AFI  14-2[MDS]  prescribes minimum MQT requirements to qualify personnel in unit missions. 3.1.3.  Continuation  Training.    CT  promotes  a  culture  of  continuous  training,  ensuring  that intelligence  personnel  are  always  qualified  and  current  to  perform  their  assigned  duties  by maintaining proficiency in the requisite knowledge, skills and abilities. 3.1.3.1.  The  Ready  Intelligence  Program  (RIP)  ensures  personnel  perform  tasks  often enough to maintain proficiency by focusing on maintaining currency in perishable skills.  RIP consists of specific wartime/contingency mission-related tasks to be performed on a regular basis to ensure intelligence personnel maintain proficiency in the skills essential to  their  duty  position.    Specific  RIP  tasks  and  required  frequency  are  located  in  the applicable AFI 14-2[MDS], or in local guidance if no 14-2[MDS] exists.  In most cases, RIP  simply  documents  activities  that  individuals  conduct  on  a  regular  basis  as  part  of their  duty  position  to  ensure  their  recurring  performance.    Whenever  an  individual performs  a  task,  unless  specifically  prohibited,  it  can  be  credited  against  their  currency date.    RIP  task  performance  by  qualified  and  current  individuals  does  not  require supervision by a trainer or evaluator. AFI14-202V1  31 MARCH 2015   11  3.1.3.2.  In addition to hands-on performance tasks, CT includes knowledge requirements to  be  met  on  a  recurring  basis.    Training,  for  the  most  part,  consists  of  unit-developed academics and scenarios.  Examples include: updates on threat systems, new or updated unit  procedures,  mandated  periodic  training  and  other  topics  identified  by  SIOs, commanders,  or  MAJCOMs.    The  means  to  accomplish  continuation  training  is  at  the discretion of the SIO IAW the unit’s annual training plan. 3.1.4.  Specialized  Training.    The  SIO  selects  personnel  who  are  to  accomplish  ST.    ST addresses  additional  skills  necessary  to  carry  out  the  unit’s  assigned  mission(s).    ST  is accomplished  after  MQT  and  after  the  member  has  attained  the  requisite  qualification  for their position.  See applicable AFI 14-2[MDS] for ST requirements.  Unless  governed by a formal syllabus, ST programs typically consist of unit-developed academics and scenarios. 3.2.  Intelligence  Mission  Readiness  Levels.  These  statuses  reflect  the  individual’s  readiness level  in  terms  of  mission  qualification  and  currency.    The  SIO  determines  the  necessary readiness  level  for  each  position  in  the  unit,  either  Combat  Mission  Ready  (CMR)  or  Basic Mission Capable (BMC).  Personnel must maintain the mission readiness level of their assigned position.  (T-1)  Mission readiness levels include Basic Qualified (BQ), BMC, and or CMR. 3.2.1.  BQ  status  identifies  intelligence  personnel  who  have  completed  IQT.    BQ  personnel are only qualified to perform basic tasks without supervision as defined in the applicable AFI 14-2[MDS].  BQ is a temporary status that is only held until completion of MQT.  Positions cannot be designated as requiring only BQ status. 3.2.2.  CMR refers to the status of intelligence personnel who have satisfactorily completed MQT  training,  successfully  completed  a  mission evaluation,  and  maintain  qualification  and currency  in  the  appropriate  tasks  and  knowledge  required  by  AFI  14-2[MDS].    Persons filling  a  CMR  position  must  be  ready  to  perform  operational  duties  on  short-notice  and without assistance.  (T-1) 3.2.3.  BMC status refers to positions or personnel who are qualified to perform all mission tasks  but  have  independent,  often  less  restrictive,  currency  requirements.    BMC  should  be considered for replacement/surge personnel who are not required to be immediately ready to perform wartime duties.  Persons filling a BMC position must be able to meet CMR currency requirements within 30 days.  (T-1) 3.2.4.  Once personnel complete MQT and the Initial Mission Qualification Evaluation (INIT MSN)  IAW  AFI  14-202,  Volume  2  and  AFI  14-2[MDS],  they  are  considered  CMR  since they are current to CMR standards at that time.  Personnel are then required to maintain the currency associated with their assigned position (CMR or BMC) by performing RIP tasks at the frequencies defined in applicable AFI 14-2[MDS]. 3.2.5.  Deployment.    Only  CMR  personnel  are  intended  to  deploy  in  support  of  the  unit’s mission. 3.2.5.1.  BMC personnel must complete all RIP tasks to meet the CMR currency standard in  order  to  deploy  in  support  of  unit  missions.    (T-2)    In  the  case  of  short-notice deployments  where  this  is  not  possible,  the  SIO  must  articulate  any  risk  to  the commander who assumes the risk of deploying BMC personnel.  (T-2)   12  AFI14-202V1  31 MARCH 2015 3.2.5.2.  BQ personnel  will  not  deploy prior to  attaining CMR status  unless  the risk has been assumed by the commander and documented in a memorandum for record, waiving CMR status for deployment.  (T-2) 3.2.5.3.  Deployment  in  support  of  joint  sourcing  solutions  other  than  unit  mission taskings do not rely on personnel qualification in their assigned mission set and therefore, mission readiness level (CMR or BMC) does not restrict deployment. AFI14-202V1  31 MARCH 2015   13  Chapter 4 TRAINING PROGRAM EXECUTION 4.1.  Training Timelines. 4.1.1.  Formal  IQT  should  be  scheduled  en  route  to  assignment  to  the  greatest  extent possible.  If en route attendance is not possible, personnel should be scheduled to  attend as practical  (no  longer  than  3  months  for  active  component  or  365  days  for  Guard/Reserve).  The timeline for completing IQT is dictated by the formal course syllabus or as determined at the unit, in lieu of specific guidance. 4.1.2.  In-unit  training  (whether  IQT  or  MQT)  begins  no  later  than  45  days  after  in-processing  actions  are  complete  and  security  clearance  is  granted  (for  Active  Component) and  no  later  than  90  days  after  return  to  unit  from  Initial  Skills  Training/formal  IQT  (for Reserve Component)  (T-2)  For first term airmen, in-unit training timeline may begin after completion  of  First  Term  Airman  Course  (FTAC)  or  equivalent.    Intelligence  personnel  in training should be dedicated to  that training (i.e. training requirements should  have priority over non-training related duties). 4.1.3.  IQT  logically  precedes  MQT,  however  there  may  be  noted  exceptions.    “Concurrent IQT/MQT”  is  authorized  in  situations  where  IQT  course  allocation/seats  are  not  available and  in  circumstances  where  the  SIO  determines  MQT  should  be  started  before  IQT completion  in  order  to  take  advantage  of  training  events  and  timelines.    Concurrent IQT/MQT may also apply in situations where the MDS/mission set is limited to one location, negating the need for separate IQT since there are no other units with which to train common tasks. 4.1.4.  The timeline for completing MQT is  dependent  on an individual’s status  (i.e. active, reserve).    MQT  normally  begins  as  soon  as  practical  following  IQT;  however  some exceptions can be made for concurrent IQT/MQT.  Standard MQT completion times are: 4.1.4.1.  Active  component  personnel  are  allotted  120  days  to  accomplish  MQT  unless stated  otherwise  in  the  applicable  AFI  14-2[MDS].    Notify  MAJCOM/A2  if  training exceeds this timeline.  (T-2) 4.1.4.2.  Active  Guard  Reserve (ART), guardsmen/reservists  (to  include  IMAs)  on  full-time  orders  of  120  consecutive  days  or greater  fall  under  the  active  component  timeline.    Notify  applicable  MAJCOM/A2  if training exceeds this timeline.  (T-2) (AGR),  Air  Reserve  Technicians 4.1.4.3.  All  other  guardsmen/reservists  are  allotted  365  calendar  days  to  accomplish MQT.  (T-2) 4.2.  Qualifications  at  Multi-MDS  Locations.  In multi-MDS wings/units,  the SIO determines which  qualifications  personnel  will  hold.    The  SIO  may  tailor  personnel  qualifications  so individuals focus on  a certain  MDS.   This  would include  attending  the  appropriate  IQT  course focused on that MDS and completing MQT IAW the applicable AFI 14-2[MDS].  However, in many cases, the SIO may determine intelligence personnel require qualification to support more than one MDS.  The most efficient way to manage training and qualification for multiple MDS is through  difference  training—specific  training  to  cover  the  differences  in  the  various  MDS  to   14  AFI14-202V1  31 MARCH 2015 meet the most stringent requirements of all MDS as well as any tasks that are not common to all MDS.    It  is  not  considered  practical  for  personnel  to  go  through  the  full  course  of  training  for each MDS.  In these cases, personnel should attend at least one  IQT program applicable to the wing/unit.  If personnel are to focus on one MDS more than others in the wing/unit, they should attend the IFTU that is most applicable.  MQT for each additional MDS would train to satisfy the MQT events not previously addressed and already trained in earlier MQT. 4.3.  Currency and Regression. 4.3.1.  CMR and BMC personnel must maintain currencies by accomplishing all designated tasks  at  the  frequencies  prescribed  by  the  applicable  AFI  14-2[MDS].    (T-2)    Failure  to maintain required currency will result in regression to non-CMR (N-CMR) or non-BMC (N-BMC) status.  (T-2) 4.3.1.1.  Non-current,  unsupervised  personnel  may  only  perform  individual  tasks  in which  they  are  current  and  qualified.    If  intelligence  personnel  lose  currency  in  a particular  task,  that  task  may  not  be  performed  except  for  the  purpose  of  regaining currency under supervision. 4.3.1.2.  For  loss  of  currency  up  to  6  months,  intelligence  personnel  must  demonstrate proficiency  in  all  delinquent  items  under  supervision  of  another  qualified  and  current individual.  (T-2) 4.3.1.3.  For loss of currency exceeding 6 months, intelligence personnel  are considered unqualified and will complete an SIO-approved requalification program.  (T-2) 4.3.1.4.  Loss  of CMR currency  does not  automatically  equate to  reversion to  BMC;  by definition,  a  position  that  requires  a  CMR  qualified  individual  cannot  be  filled  by someone at a BMC readiness level. 4.3.2.  Extensions.  The SIO may extend training currency timelines in certain circumstances when  personnel  are  not  available  for  training  events  (e.g.,  TDY,  extended  or  emergency leave).  Additional training timeline extension (may also be referred to as proration) guidance may be established in each AFI 14-2[MDS].  Individuals preparing to depart on an extended TDY  (e.g.,  professional  military  education  [PME])  should  ensure  all  training  requirements are current prior to departure. 4.4.  Loss of qualification.  Intelligence personnel revert to unqualified status upon expiration of their  qualification  evaluations  or  loss  of  currency  exceeding  6  months,  whichever  occurs  first; this includes specialized qualifications.  Qualification status is also subject to review based on an individual’s duty performance.   Loss  of qualification may be driven by  considerations such as:  lack of proficiency in intelligence duties, lack of progress or lack of judgment, as determined by the SIO. 4.5.  Requalification.  Unless  made  more  restrictive  in  AFI  14-2[MDS],  requalification requirements are as follows: 4.5.1.  Unqualified less than 2 Years.  Complete training in all delinquent items as applicable, along  with  any  additional  training  as  directed  by  the  SIO.    Requalification  also  requires  a requalification  (RQ)  evaluation  (explained  in  AFI  14-202  Volume  2  and  AFI  14-2[MDS]).  (T-2) AFI14-202V1  31 MARCH 2015   15  4.5.2.  Unqualified  2  to  5  Years.    Reaccomplish  MQT.    A  formal  requalification  course,  if identified by the AFI 14-2[MDS], satisfies this requirement.  Requalification also requires an RQ MSN.  (T-2) 4.5.3.  Unqualified  Over  5  Years. Requalification also requires an RQ MSN.  (T-2)   Reaccomplish the  IQT  and  MQT  programs. 4.6.  Unsatisfactory  Performance.  Trainees  receiving  an  overall  "Fail"  will  be  placed  (or remain)  in  supervised  status  until  recommended  additional  training  is  completed  and/or  a requalification  is  successfully  accomplished.    (T-1)    If  a  trainee  fails  to  satisfactorily  progress through any phase of qualification training (e.g., IQT, MQT, or ST), after repeated attempts, the supervisor,  UTM  and  SIO  should  refer  to  AFI  36-2201,  "Training  Status  Code  T"  for  the commander's actions if the trainee is to be considered for withdrawal from training.  (T-2) 4.7.  Permanent Change of Station (PCS)/Permanent Change of Assignment (PCA). 4.7.1.  Upon PCS/PCA to a different mission set, individuals will enter qualification training beginning  with  IQT  per  the  specific  AFI  14-2[MDS]  and  prepare  to  progress  through  the requisite training  and stan/eval  events  until  achieving mission readiness level  as designated by SIO. 4.7.2.  Individuals  moving  to  a  like  mission  set  (e.g.  DGS-1  to  DGS-2)  may  retain  current qualifications.  The gaining unit should note the member’s evaluation due dates and enter the member into the local MQT.  Upon completion of MQT, the member is entered into CT/RIP.  The member may complete the mission evaluation (MSN) as previously scheduled.  Unless directed  by  the  SIO,  there  is  no  requirement  to  do  a  MSN  ahead  of  the  already  scheduled suspense; the member’s next evaluation due date remains the same as from the losing unit. 4.7.3.  Individuals moving to a similar mission set under the same lead command (e.g. A-10 to F-16) should be assessed to determine their previous training and level of experience.  If their previous  IQT meets current  requirements, the SIO may request  a waiver through their MAJCOM to the lead command allowing the individual to undergo an abbreviated in-house IQT or proceed directly to MQT.  These individuals do not retain their qualification, however the MQT and CT tasks accomplished in their prior position may be considered for validation.  All tasks are to be evaluated as part of the INIT MSN evaluation IAW AFI 14-202, Volume 2 and AFI 14-2[MDS]. 4.7.4.  Individuals  returning  to  a  mission  set  after  a  break  in  qualification  will  follow  the requalification rule sets IAW AFI 14-202, and applicable AFI 14-2[MDS].  (T-2) 4.8.  Documentation.  The  trainee’s  performance  and  progress  through  each  MQT  and  ST training item will be documented on the AF Form 4381, Intelligence Gradesheet.  (T-2)  Specific MQT/ST  intelligence  gradesheet  elements  for  inclusion  on  the  AF  Form  4381  are  located  in applicable AFI 14-2[MDS].  Attachment 3 contains a detailed explanation for filling out the AF Form 4381.  Online documentation will be in coordination with AF/A2 approved processes.  (T-2) 4.8.1.  AF  Form  4381  may  be  used  for  documentation  of  IQT  in-line  with  the  training command’s processes.  In-house IQT may be documented using the 4381 with task elements derived from the formal course syllabus.   16  AFI14-202V1  31 MARCH 2015 4.8.2.  Completion  of  qualification  training  may  be  annotated  on  the  individual’s  AF  Form 623,  Individual  Training  Record  Folder;  documentation  of  each  individual  task  is  not required. AFI14-202V1  31 MARCH 2015   17  Chapter 5 SPECIALIZED TRAINING 5.1.  Intelligence Evaluator (IE). 5.1.1.  To be considered  for progression to  IE, the individual must be CMR or BMC in  the position they will evaluate.  (T-1) 5.1.2.  Specific  MDS/mission  sets  may  require  IEs  to  successfully  complete  a  MAJCOM-approved IE course.  The lead command determines this requirement which is defined in the applicable AFI 14-2[MDS]. 5.1.3.  IE ST Profiles.  IE trainees must complete the following profiles.  (T-1) 5.1.3.1.  IE 1 – IE Evaluation Observation.  Objective:  Observe an evaluation, ideally a MSN or INIT MSN.  Specific tasks:  Comprehend evaluation criteria, grading procedures and  evaluation  form  preparation  for  any  mission  profile.    Identify  scenarios  for intelligence evaluations, objectivity issues, and techniques for conducting evaluations. 5.1.3.2.  IE  2  –  IE  Proficiency.    Objective:    Demonstrate  proficiency  in  successfully conducting an evaluation.  Perform the evaluation with  the trainer as the examinee in a simulated  evaluation.    Specific  tasks:    Under  observation,  conduct  an  evaluation  and provide a thorough debrief and critique.  Demonstrate knowledge of evaluation criteria, grading procedures and proficiency in evaluation form preparation. 5.1.4.  Specific  MDS/mission  sets  may  require  observation  of  additional  specialized evaluation  types  (e.g.  EIT).    Any  additional  profiles  are  described  in  applicable  AFI  14-2[MDS].  (T-2) 5.1.5.  The AF Form 4381 will be used to document the trainee’s performance through IE ST.  Table 5.1 lists the elements to be used on the form.  (T-2) Table 5.1.  Intelligence Evaluator Gradesheet Elements. 1.  Preparation 2.  Decision making 3.  Objectives 4.  Communication skills 5.  Knowledge 6.  Organization 7.  Documentation 8.  Security 5.1.6.  IE  Currency.    IEs  must  conduct  at  least  one  corresponding  evaluation  annually  to remain current and must also successfully complete periodic IE evaluations.  (T-1)  If an IE loses  currency,  the  individual  will  not  perform  IE  duties  unsupervised  until  currency  is regained.    (T-2)    To  regain  currency,  non-current  IEs  must  satisfy  overdue  training requirements while supervised by another current and qualified IE.  (T-2)   18  AFI14-202V1  31 MARCH 2015 5.2.  External Intelligence Training (EIT) Trainer.  AFI14-2[MDS] identifies the requirement for  qualified  EIT  trainers.    Only  qualified  EIT  trainers  may  conduct  unsupervised  intelligence training of non-intelligence AFSC personnel.  (T-1) 5.2.1.  Any intelligence personnel selected for EIT trainer must: 5.2.1.1.  Be CMR or BMC qualified in a baseline crew/duty position.  (T-2) 5.2.1.2.  Be designated by the SIO.  (T-2) 5.2.1.3.  Complete the requirements for EIT Concepts and Methods Profile, in addition to any profiles required by the applicable 14-2[MDS].  (T-2) 5.2.2.  EIT  Concepts  and  Methods.    Objective:    Effectively  apply  appropriate  instructional concepts  and  methods  to  fulfill  EIT  requirements.    Specific  tasks:    Demonstrate  ability  to modify  training  to  the  specific  audience.    Demonstrate  the  methods  of  delivering  training using  visual,  auditory  and  physical  application.    Demonstrate  one-on-one,  small  group  and large audience training techniques.  Define methods to verify trainee achievement. 5.2.3.  EIT  Evaluation.    EIT  evaluations  will  be  conducted  IAW  AFI  14-202,  Volume  2, Intelligence  Standardization/Evaluation  Program,  and  the  applicable  14-2[MDS].    (T-1)  Personnel are qualified as EITs upon successful completion of required tasks, an initial EIT qualification evaluation and SIO endorsement. 5.2.4.  EIT  Trainer  Currency.    If  an  EIT  trainer  loses  currency  in  a  particular  area,  the individual may not perform unsupervised training in that area until currency is regained.  EIT trainers who are non-current must satisfy overdue training requirements while supervised by another EIT trainer who is current and qualified in the same training event.  (T-2) 5.3.  Force  Protection  Intelligence  Training  (FPIT).  FPIT is  a type of  EIT.   FPIT should be provided to Security Forces and other support agencies, as required.  FPIT should be focused on four  educational  goals:    (1)  roles,  missions  and  capabilities  of  Intelligence;  (2)  debriefing  and reporting  process  (where  applicable);  (3)  threat  identification  and  capabilities  and  (4)  base defense intelligence requirements. 5.3.1.  Complete the requirements for FPIT Trainer Profile. 5.3.2.  FPIT  Trainer  Profile.    Event  objective:    The  trainee  is  expected  to  demonstrate proficiency  in  developing  instructional  material  and  providing  academic  instruction  on intelligence support to FP.  Specific tasks:  Demonstrate the ability to develop and present an FP intelligence training session tailored to the specific audience. 5.4.  Intelligence  Instructor.  The  lead  command  may  specify  additional  ST  requirements  for qualification  trainers  that  lead  to  a  specialized  qualification  of  Intelligence  Instructor.  Intelligence  Instructor  ST  requirements,  if  used,  are  outlined  in  the  applicable  AFI  14-2[MDS] and are in addition to the qualification trainer requirements.  ROBERT P.

Waivers  may  be  granted  at  the  MAJCOM/CC  level,  with  the  concurrence  of  the  publication’s Approving Official. Tier 2 (T-2)—Non-compliance may degrade mission or program effectiveness or efficiency and has  potential  to  create  moderate  risk  of  mission  or  program  failure,  injury,  legal  jeopardy  or unacceptable fraud, waste or abuse.  Waivers may be granted at the MAJCOM/CC level, but may not be delegated lower than MAJCOM Director. Tier 3 (T-3)—Non-compliance may limit mission or program effectiveness or efficiency and has a relatively remote potential to create risk of mission or program degradation or failure, injury, legal  jeopardy  or  unacceptable  fraud,  waste  or  abuse.    Waivers  may  be  granted  at  the Wing/DRU/FOA/CC level (delegable no lower than Group/CC or equivalent).    22  AFI14-202V1  31 MARCH 2015 Attachment 2 AF FORM 4381, INTELLIGENCE GRADESHEET A2.1.  AF  Form  4381,  Intelligence  Gradesheet.    The  AF  Form  4381  provides  a  structured  and standardized  depiction  on  how  well  a  trainee  is  progressing  through  individual  training  events. Using  a  grading  system,  it  depicts  how  well  a  trainee  is  grasping  the  knowledge  of  training events or ability to perform required tasks.  It also provides trainers and supervisors a means to improve trainee performance for specific tasks by giving rapid written feedback on the trainee’s abilities  during  each  training  event.    Use  of  the  AF  Form  4381  enhances  the  overall  training process and prepares the trainee for the requirements of the standardization /evaluation program. A2.2.  The AF Form 4381 is used by Intelligence Qualification Trainers to record completion of MQT  and  ST  events.    Gradesheets  are  to  be  filed  in  the  trainee’s  qualification  training  record.  Intelligence Evaluators also use the gradesheets to assist in the completion of the AF Form 4350. A2.3.  General Data Entry.  Use the following guidance when completing an AF Form 4381.  In all  instances  of  data  entry,  if  an  electronic  form  is  used,  the  format  required  by  the  electronic system takes precedence. A2.3.1.  Individual  Event  Gradesheet:    Enter  the  name  of  the  event  in  this  field.    For example, “Pre-Mission Briefing.” A2.3.2.  Event Number:  Enter the event iteration number.  If this is the first time the trainee has been graded for this event then the field would be “l.” A2.3.3.  Position  Number:    Enter  the  position  number  from  the  unit  manning  document (UMD) of the trainee. A2.3.4.  Event Duration:  Enter the amount of time spent training, demonstrating, performing and evaluating the training event.  This field is meant to be a metric to track the amount of time it takes to complete the training event from initial instruction to graded performance. A2.3.5.  Date:    Enter  the  date  on  which  the  event  was  performed  and  graded.    If  the  event takes more than one day use the date for the day the event was completed not begun. A2.3.6.  Name:  Enter the rank and name of the trainee. A2.3.7.  Class Number:  For formal courses, enter the class number the trainee is attending.  If training is not done during a formal course, leave this field blank. A2.3.8.  MDS:  Enter MDS or intelligence function the trainee is supporting. A2.3.9.  Instructor/Evaluation:    Enter  the  rank  and  name  of  the  instructor  or  evaluator grading the performance of the event. A2.3.10.  Intelligence  Gradesheet:    This  column  of  cells  lists  the  required  task  elements  as specified  by  each  mission  set’s  14-2[MDS].   If  one  page  is  not  sufficient  to  contain  all the task elements or comments, continue on the reverse. A2.3.11.  N/A:    For  each  task  element,  ensure  the  element  is  applicable  to  the  event  being graded.  If the element is not applicable, mark the “N/A” block and do not grade the element (leave that line unmarked). AFI14-202V1  31 MARCH 2015   23  A2.3.12.  COVERED  Y/N:    For  each  task  element,  annotate  if  the  element  was  addressed during the performance of the event.  If the element was covered, mark “Yes.”  If the element was not covered, mark “No.” A2.3.13.  Grade  3,  Grade  2,  Grade  1:    Grade  each  numbered  task  element.  For  each numbered  element,  consider  all  sub-numbered  and  sub-lettered  elements  to  determine  the grade for the numbered element.  Using the rubric: A2.3.13.1.  Grade 1—Performance is correct, efficient, skillful and without hesitation A2.3.13.2.  Grade 2—Performance is essentially correct.  Recognizes and corrects errors A2.3.13.3.  Grade 3—Performance indicates a lack of ability or knowledge A2.3.14.  Overall Event  Qualification:  THIS FIELD IS ONLY REQUIRED FOR USE BY EVALUATORS.  The evaluator considers all grades given to the numbered task elements to determine the overall  grade for the  event.   Consider the  guidance in  AFI  14-202 Volume 2 when awarding the overall grade to the event: A2.3.14.1.  Qualified  (Q):    Q  is  the  desired  level  of  performance.    The  examinee demonstrated  a  satisfactory  knowledge  of  all  required information,  performed intelligence  duties  within  the  prescribed  tolerances  and  accomplished  the  assigned mission. A2.3.14.2.  Qualified with discrepancies (Q-):  Q- indicates the examinee is qualified to perform  the  assigned  area  tasks,  but  requires  debriefing  or  additional  training  as determined by the evaluator. A2.3.14.3.  Unqualified  (U):    Assign  a  U  area  grade  for  any  performance  outside allowable parameters or deviations from prescribed procedures/tolerances that adversely affected mission accomplishment or compromised safety.  An examinee receiving an area grade of U normally requires additional training.  When, in the judgment of the evaluator, additional  training  will  not  constructively  improve  the  examinee’s  performance,  a thorough debrief of the examinee may be used to provide appropriate feedback. A2.3.14.4.  The  same  grading  methodology  is  used  in  training  as  during  evaluations.  This  is  to  ensure  that  personnel  are  trained  to  the  minimum  standard  that  has  been identified  in  the  community’s  AFI  14-2[MDS].    Instructors  should  reference  AFI  14-2[MDS]  for  grading  criteria  for  each  event.    The  grading  criteria  should  be  considered when determining the final mark (Q, Q- or U) for the overall event. A2.3.15.  REMARKS:    The  instructor/trainer  enters  amplifying  comments  to  describe  the performance of the event.  Remarks should summarize the key steps which occurred during the  training  of  the  event.    Annotating  when  training  was  begun,  what  was  instructed,  what was demonstrated and observed and how the trainee performed and when training concluded would be a good basic outline to follow. A2.3.16.  Signature of Instructor/Trainer:  The instructor/trainer signs here. A2.3.17.  Student Initials:  The trainee initials here. A2.3.18.  Supervisor  Initials:    The  trainee’s  supervisor  reviews  the  gradesheet  and  initials here.   24  AFI14-202V1  31 MARCH 2015 Figure A2.1.  Example AF Form 4381, Intelligence Gradesheet.
