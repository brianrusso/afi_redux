Trailers centrally procured by Robins AFB Support Equipment and Vehicles Division (SE&V) (to include military design (tactical) trailers) are classified and managed as a  registered  vehicle  IAW  with  this  AFI.    Any  trailers  meeting  all  elements  of  following criterion will also be classified and managed as a registered vehicle IAW AF standards.  Robins AFB  SE&V  is  the  only  authorized  purchasing  agent  for  AF  registered  vehicles  (refer  to paragraph 3.10.6.) 1.1.3.1.  Measuring 6‘x12‘(width x length) or larger. 1.1.3.2.

Notes: 1.  Vehicle Management is only responsible for the management and maintenance of the “registered” trailer itself.  All equipment on the trailer that has a specific organizational use will be maintained by the using organization.  2.  When the trailer is manufactured around a specific item that is “permanently attached” (meaning mounted items won’t be removed to configure trailer for transportation of other items) as an integral piece of a trailer, and the sole purpose of the trailer is for transporting that item, the trailer is automatically classified an equipment item and is not a vehicle by AF definition.   3.  Refer to paragraph 3.17.2. for policy concerning trailers not classified as a “vehicle”. Exception:   Trailers classified as Construction, Mining, Excavating and Highway Maintenance Equipment in Federal Stock Class Group 3800 (Examples e.g. concrete mixer, mounted vacuum cleaner, water distribution tanker, dump trailer, pneumatic drill, sewer trailers) will be classified as a vehicle.  (T-1). 1.1.4.  Controlled vehicles.  Aircraft and ground support equipment tow tractors, major crash fire  rescue  vehicles,  MHE,  aircraft  refuelers,  compressed  gas  servicing  equipment,  special aircraft and missile cranes, personnel lifting mechanisms on high reach trucks or cranes, M-series  tactical  vehicles,  support  equipment  and  munitions  MHE.    Additional  guidance  is provided in AFI 91-103, Air Force Nuclear Safety Design Certification Program, for nuclear certified assets. 1.1.5.  AF  Executive  Fleet.    Authorizations/vehicles  assigned  to  Wing  Commanders  and above. 1.2.  Supplements  to  this  Instruction.  MAJCOMs  must  route  all  proposed  supplemental guidance to AF/A4LR for consideration and approval prior to approved publication actions.  (T-1). 1.2.1.  Directive  Instructions  that  issue  specific  guidance  for  use  for  ANG,  FOA,  DRU  and units  below  the  MAJCOM  level  are  authorized  IAW  AFI  33-360,  Publications  and  Forms Management, which is consistent and compliant with this AFI. 1.3.  Changes to this Instruction.  AF activities can submit suggested changes using AF Form 847 to AF/A4LR for consideration. 24 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 Note:  Sample OIs can be found at AF Vehicle Management Neighborhood SharePoint (VM Neighborhood) site: https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/OO-LG-AF-66/default.aspx. 1.4.  Operating Instructions (OI).  Unit level Vehicle Management activities set and implement local  guidance  in  the  form  of  OIs,  IAW  AFI  33-360,  Publications  and  Forms  Management.  Typically,  OIs  are  established  for  hours  of  operation,  housekeeping,  safety,  security,  fire prevention,  minimum  essential  repairs,  quality  control  procedures,  hazardous  and  solid  waste management and pollution prevention procedures and to cover location or unit-unique operations.  Maintain a master file of the OIs in a central location, readily available to all personnel. 1.4.1.  Coordinate OIs with appropriate agencies as needed and review or update as required by the VFM/VMS. 1.4.2.  In activities where foreign nationals are employed, establish bilingual (English and host country  language)  unless  the  ability  to  read  and  comprehend  English  is  a  condition  of employment for all vehicle management employees.

Section 1B—AF Vehicle Serviceability Standards and Types of Maintenance Used to Support Standard. 1.6.  Serviceability Standards.  Minimum serviceability standards for day-to-day operations are determined by the VFM/VMS based on his or her experience, manufacturers‘ specifications and applicable technical reference.  The VFM/VMS is entrusted to manage/maintain AF vehicles in safe and serviceable condition.  (T-1). Note: Ensure GSA leased vehicles are maintained consistent with GSA schedules and standards; however, deficiencies affecting safety will be corrected at the GSA approved maintenance facility regardless of reimbursement (bill-back).  (T-0). 1.6.1.  The AF accepts the idea that as vehicles age a certain amount of wear and tear will occur and that AF vehicles cannot be maintained in a like-new condition. 1.6.2.  Judge serviceability using the following factors: 1.6.2.1.  Age and mileage of the vehicle. 1.6.2.2.  Requirement for the type of vehicle and job it is designed to do. 1.6.2.3.  Remaining service life. 1.6.2.4.  Value of use returned in comparison with the cost of needed repairs. 1.6.3.  Vehicles  and  vehicular  equipment  items  identified  on  the  USAF  Master  Nuclear Certification Listing (MNCL) are maintained IAW manufacture standards, TO 36-1-191 and other relevant vehicle maintenance technical orders and manuals.  “Serviceability Standards” are the same for all USAF registered vehicles regardless of “nuclear certified” status.  Special or more stringent standards for “nuclear certified” registered vehicles and vehicular equipment do not exist. 1.7.  Organizational  Maintenance.  Organizational  maintenance  is  accomplished  by  unit-level vehicle operators in the various squadrons and activities across an installation.  Operators use the vehicle’s applicable Operator’s Inspection Guide and Trouble Report, applicable TOs or Owner’s manual when accomplishing organizational maintenance.  Specific organizational responsibilities are outlined in paragraph 3.19. 1.8.  Intermediate Maintenance.  Intermediate maintenance is accomplished by the base Vehicle Management  Flight,  including  major  and  minor  repairs.    The  VFM/VMS  determines  shop capabilities  and  decides  which  source  of  repair  to  use.    Manpower,  total  cost,  mission requirements, Non- Mission Capable (NMC) time, shop tools, equipment and technical capability should  influence  this  decision-making  process.    Normally  done  in  fixed  shops,  intermediate maintenance includes: AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 27 1.8.1.  Preventive Maintenance and Inspections (PM&I) and Special Inspections. 1.8.2.  Repairing, fabricating or replacing unserviceable components. 1.8.3.  Refinishing,  modifying  (as  directed  by  TO),  repairing  accessories  and  auxiliary equipment and doing structural repair. 1.8.4.  Furnishing technical assistance to using organizations. 1.8.5.  When repair exceeds the base capability, maintenance may be performed: 1.8.5.1.  By a local off-base contract. 1.8.5.2.  At a nearby AF base.  Comply with AFI 25-201, Support Agreements, if personnel adjustments are needed. 1.8.5.3.  Under  Inter-Service  Support  Agreement  (ISSA)  at  nearby  military  or  other government  shops.    Affected  commanders  or  equivalents  concur  on  cost  and  vehicle disposition issues. 1.9.  Depot-Level Maintenance.  This level of maintenance provides technical aid (see TO 00-25-4, Depot Maintenance of Aerospace Vehicles and Training Equipment) and overhaul of specific vehicles (refer to TO 36-1-191).  Robins AFB SE&V manages depot-level maintenance for AF needs. 1.10.  Mobile Maintenance.  The nature of certain vehicle repairs requires maintenance support away  from  Vehicle  Management.    The  vehicle  repair  technician  will  debrief  the  supervisor  in charge  or  the  vehicle  operator  concerning  vehicle  deficiencies.    (T-1).    Review  the  Operator‘s Inspection Guide and Trouble Report for annotated maintenance problems.  (T-1). 1.10.1.  Mobile Maintenance can be used to perform PM&I and Special Inspections on vehicles not  easily  brought  to  or  unable  to  enter  the  maintenance  shop  due  to  size.    Advance coordination  is  essential  for  proper  planning  and  scheduling.    Accomplish  a  complete inspection  of  the  vehicle  or  vehicular  equipment  item  at  the time  of  the  PM&I  and  Special Inspections.  (T-0). 1.10.2.  The  Mobile  Maintenance  truck  may  be  equipped  with  a  tow  attachment,  a  battery booster and power plant, per Allowance Standard (AS) 457.  The truck may carry tools (AS 403 and 457) and spare parts so that full PM&I and routine unscheduled work can be done.  This truck may be two-way radio and/or cell phone equipped. 1.10.3.  The VFM/VMS have the option to expand Mobile Maintenance to include performing minor maintenance at selected units.  It may be desirable to send a mobile maintenance truck to  large  organizations  (Civil  Engineer  Squadron  (CES),  Security  Forces  Squadron  (SFS), Aircraft Maintenance, etc.) on a scheduled frequency to perform minor repairs. 1.10.4.  The  VFM/VMS  determines,  and  then  justifies,  the  number  of  Mobile  Maintenance trucks necessary to be assigned. 1.10.5.  If the required repairs are beyond Mobile Maintenance capabilities, request wrecker assistance from Vehicle Operations.  (T-1).  During other than normal operating hours, Vehicle Operations will deliver the disabled vehicle to the Vehicle Management parking area.  (T-1).  The Operators Inspection Guide and Trouble Report reflect the vehicle‘s problem and must 28 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 accompany the vehicle.  (T-1).  During the next duty day, the using organization must formally turn the vehicle in to Vehicle Management.  (T-1). 1.11.  Scheduled Maintenance.  Scheduled maintenance includes PM&I and Special Inspections, at regular intervals to maintain a safe and serviceable vehicle fleet. 1.11.1.  DELETED. 1.11.2.  DELETED. 1.11.3.  DELETED. 1.11.4.

Provide  maintenance  priority  to transient vehicles according to their mission or circumstance. Note:  The procedures for vehicle operators to have maintenance done on vehicles in-transit are in AFMAN 24-306_IP, Manual for the Wheeled Vehicle Operator.  1.13.  Vehicle  Abuse  and  Accidents  Maintenance.  Vehicle  and  vehicular  equipment  abuse  is considered damage caused by willful or negligent acts of improper operation or care.  A vehicle or  vehicular  equipment  accident  is  a  result  of  a  major  or  minor  impact/collision  with  another vehicle  or  object.    The  Logistics  Readiness  Squadron  (LRS)  Commander  or  equivalent  will establish  local  reporting  procedures  and  these  procedures  will  be  fully  supported  by  all commanders to be totally effective.  (T-1).  Using organizations will fund for costs associated with government owned, rental/lease vehicle abuse and/or accident damage.  (T-1). Note:  Publish these implementing instructions at wing–level or equivalents.   1.13.1.  All  Vehicle  Management  operation  &  maintenance  (O&M)  funds  expended  for vehicle  accident  and  abuse  repair  costs,  including  contract  cost,  are    reimbursed  to  Vehicle Management by the owning organization or the organization responsible for the damage if not the owner.  This includes cost for repairs of all GMVs involved in the abuse or accident incident when multiple GMVs are involved. 1.13.2.  Where responsibility cannot be determined, owning organizations are responsible for reimbursement.    An  Investigating  Officer  investigates  accident/abuse  incidences  and completes Report of Survey (ROS) IAW AFMAN 23-220, Reports of Survey for Air Force Property,  when  there  is  evidence  of  gross  negligence,  willful  misconduct,  or  deliberate unauthorized  use  pertaining  to  the  loss,  damage,  or  destruction  of  a  government  vehicle  or when the vehicle property records are (i.e. the vehicle is a total loss).  Vehicle Management notifies  the  applicable  commander  or  equivalent  and  Vehicle  Control  Officer  (VCO)  or Vehicle Control Noncommissioned Control Officer (VCNCO) of the unit involved, along with Base Legal, Finance and Safety Office (usually by form letter) as applicable.  (T-1). 1.13.2.1.  When accidents or abuses involve vehicles dispatched from the LRS U-Drive-It (UDI)  fleet,  the  organization  which  operated  the  vehicle  is  considered  the  “using AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 29 organization” and subsequently responsible for accident/abuse repair reimbursement when fault cannot be determined.  (T-1). 1.13.2.2.  All accidents involving GSA vehicles, regardless of damage will be reported to the GSA Accident Management Center by the operator/owning organization IAW FMR §102-34.295.    (T-0).    The  owning  organization  or  party  found  liable  for  accident/abuse damage  will  be  responsible  for  reimbursing  the  cost  of  repairs  up  front.    (T-0).    Which method to use is up to the organization managing the BOAC. 1.13.3.  In the event of a government owned vehicle accident, include a copy of the accident report for Base Safety Office use.  Vehicle Management commences repair within a locally established  time  frame  unless  notified  otherwise  by  the  using  organization  or  ROS investigating official. Note:  If a government owned vehicle caused a fatality or was involved in a fatality or an accident with private property the Base Legal Office must release the vehicle before repairs commence.  1.13.4.  Incidents  are  classified  as  damage  caused  by  acts  of  nature,  natural  disasters, mechanical  failures  or  other  phenomenon  that  in  no  way  could  have  been  avoided  by  safe operation or adequate vehicle care during non-use.  The VFM/VMS is the fleet management functional expert with the authority to determine what is/is not classified as an incident.  Using organizations are not required to reimburse for damage caused by incidents. Note:  Wind damage to vehicle doors is not an act of nature. 1.13.5.  If a  government  owned vehicle  caused  a  fatality or was involved  in  a fatality or an accident with private property the Base Legal Office must release the vehicle before repairs commence.  (T-1). Section 1C—Railway Equipment   1.14.  Railway Equipment.

AFCEC  notifies  441  VSCOS  of  any  updated  configuration  standard requirements. 1.20.7.1.2.  Once  coordinated  documents  are  attained,  441  VSCOS  posts  updated configuration standard on the VM Neighborhood and notifies Robins AFB SE&V. 1.20.7.2.  Upon  request  by  Robins  AFB  SE&V,  existing  configuration  standards  are updated as required to de-conflict procuring issues with existing standards.  The following procedure applies. 1.20.7.2.1.  Robins AFB SE&V notifies 441 VSCOS of issues/concerns with minimum configuration standards. Note:  Robbins SE & V will contact 441 VSCOS and AFCEC to resolve any issues/concerns with the Minimum Configuration Standards for CE or RED HORSE vehicles. 1.20.7.2.2.  441  VSCOS  contacts  AFCEC  to  discuss/resolve  vehicle  configuration standard issues. 1.20.7.2.3.  Once  resolution  is  attained,  441  VSCOS  coordinates  with  affected functional activity, post updated configuration standard on the VM Neighborhood and notify Robins AFB SE&V.  (T-1). 1.21.  Vehicle Validation (VV) Process Review  .  During a program review, AF/A4L tasked 441 VSCOS to develop an action plan to reduce VV travel cost and time.  As a result, AF/A4L has approved the 441 VSCOS to adapt and modernize the process to right size base vehicle fleets.  The implementation of these enterprise processes has created leverage for current business intelligence capabilities  and  is  integrated  with  the  Logistics  Installation  and  Mission  Support  Enterprise Vehicle View (LIMS-EV Vehicle View) as a fleet management decision support system (FMDSS).  This FMDSS contains the required logic to facilitate the validation process by replacing the current method of face-to-face interviews at over 300 locations every three years.  It also systematically generates a validated “core set” of authorizations and a target list of authorizations that could be further reviewed for validation using email and/or video-teleconference with the customer, or in rare instances a site visit by a small contingent of functional experts. 1.22.  Commercial Internet Service Provider (CISP) for Vehicle Diagnostic Equipment. 1.22.1.  Overview.  The  AF  has  more  than  50,000  intelligent  vehicles  which  use  computer based  diagnostics  equipment.    This  equipment  services  on-board  vehicle  computers  and performs  malfunction  diagnostics.    Vehicle  families  have  different  types  of  diagnostic AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 35 computers,  which  must  be  connected  to  the  manufacture’s  web  site  to  download  vehicle executable files and diagnose maintenance problems.  Diagnostic equipment is unique to each vehicle with some devices running unique operating systems, which are not Standard Desktop Compliant (SDC).  All devices download executable files from the vehicle vendor’s web site for transfer to on-board vehicle computer systems.  Consequently, vehicle diagnostic devices cannot connect to the manufacture’s web site from AF networks.  The only connection solution is through use of a CISP.  As a result, the AF Chief Information Officer (SAF/CIO A6), in coordination with the Designated Accrediting Authority, has authorized the procurement and utilization  of  CISPs  in  support  of  AF  vehicle  diagnostic  computers/equipment,  provided AF/A4L policy and established Rules of Behavior are followed and enforced. 1.22.2.  AF/A4L Policy.  A vehicle management CISP connection is solely for connection of AF vehicle diagnostic equipment to vehicle manufacture and diagnostic equipment vendor’s web sites for the purpose of maintaining AF vehicles and equipment.  Computers configured with vehicle diagnostic software are authorized to use this connection but no other computer endpoint devices are permitted to connect to the CISP.  Connection of unauthorized computer or other endpoint devices will be in violation of this policy and the Rules of Behavior and are subject  to  punishment  under  the  Uniform  Code  of  Military  Justice  or  administrative consequences for Department of the AF civilians.  Contractors violating the Rules of Behavior are subject to the terms of their contract. 1.22.2.1.  DELETED. 1.22.3.  Rules    of    Behavior.

Safeguard the connection from improper use while in your control.  (T-1). 1.23.  Green Procurement. 1.23.1.  Background.  IAW  Section  6002  of  the  Resource  Conservation  and  Recovery  Act (RCRA), Section 9002 of the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act (FSRI) of 2002, and EO 13423, Federal agencies are directed to implement sustainable environmental practices for the acquisition of green products and services.  As a result, Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Subpart 23.4, Use of Recovered Materials and Biobased Products, current edition, provides policy and procedure towards the procurement of recycled-content and biobased products, such as  United  States  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA)-designated  recycled-content  and Department  of  Agriculture  (USDA)-designated  biobased  products,  to  include,  EPA  and USDA-designated antifreeze, refined lubricating oil, sorbents and vehicle tires. 1.23.2.  The DOD Green Procurement Program (GPP) was established in 2004 and provides an  agency-wide  strategy  for  implementing  an  effective  program.    The  purpose  of  the  DOD GPP  is  to  enhance  and  sustain  mission  readiness  through  cost  effective  acquisition  that achieves  compliance  and  reduces  resource  consumption  and  waste  generation.    Green procurement  practices  also  play  a  key  role  in  enhancing  transportation  efficiency  and sustainable buildings.  The DoD GPP applies to all acquisitions from major systems programs to individual unit supply and service requisitions.  This strategy does not directly address the compliance requirements of any specific component of the Federal Green Purchasing Program; rather  it  defines  the  management  framework  all  DOD  organizations  will  use  to  ensure compliance  with  procurement  preference  requirements  as  a  routine  part  of  day-to-day purchasing activities, and the AF/A4LR GPP policy maintains that same strategy. 1.23.3.  An  AF/CV  Memorandum,  Air  Force  Green  Procurement  Program,  June  2,  2011, reaffirmed  the  requirements  of  existing  executive  and  legislative  mandates,  and  AF  GPP policy, and required each functional activity to integrate GPP requirements into their respective instructions in order to instill a philosophy of sustainability throughout the AF. 1.24.  Green  Procurement Program.  AF  Vehicle Management  activities will establish a  GPP giving  first  preference  (preferred  procurement)  to  EPA-designated  recycled-content  vehicular products and USDA-designated biobased products and shall purchase designated products/items in  the  following  categories  to  the  maximum  extent  practical;  meeting  performance  and  safety standards set forth by vehicle manufactures and technical orders, while being procured in a cost-effective manner.  (T-0). 1.24.1.  Engine Coolants (EPA). 1.24.2.  Engine Oil, Gear Oil, Hydraulic Fluids and Lubricants (EPA and USDA). 38 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 1.24.3.  Sorbent Products (USDA). 1.24.4.  Tires (EPA). Notes: 1.  DELETED. 2.  Applicable designated item procurement guidelines may apply almost exclusively to CONUS, Alaska, Hawaii and U.S. territorial installations.  However, Vehicle Management activities OCONUS (except Alaska, Hawaii and U.S. territories) are highly encouraged, but not required, to buy recycled-content products locally whenever these products meet technical needs, are readily available and are cost effective.  The key requirement for OCONUS activities is to be aware that all purchases made in the U.S. for shipment to an overseas installation must comply with EPA Comprehensive Procurement Guidelines requirements, unless exception exist.  (T-0). 3. All applicable vehicle management activities will utilize the GPP Log regardless of location or procurement source (refer to paragraph 1.30.2).  (T-1). 1.25.  General  Exceptions.  Vehicle  Management  activities  will  not  purchase  EPA-designated recycled-content or USDA-designated biobased products if any of the following conditions apply. 1.25.1.  Item cannot be purchased within a reasonable timeframe and mission impairment is imminent. 1.25.2.  Item  does  not  meet  performance  standard  or  manufactures  requirements.    This exception  includes  specific  restrictions  listed  in  TO  36-1-191  (e.g.,  retreaded,  recapped  or regrooved tire use/application restrictions), or specific product requirements/restrictions listed by manufactures (e.g., the exclusive use of specialized coolants or motor oils). Note:  Refer to paragraph 5.42. for general tire procurement policies and procedures. 1.25.3.  Item is not available at a price equal to/or less than the comparable non-EPA or USDA-designated product cost. 1.25.4.  USDA-designated  biobased  items  (i.e.,  hydraulic  fluids  and  penetrating  fluids)  will not received preferred procurement for either of the following: 1.25.4.1.  In support of spacecraft/launch support equipment. 1.25.4.2.  In support of military-series or tactical vehicles designed or procured for combat or combat-related missions. 1.26.  Program Responsibilities. 1.26.1.  AF/A4LR will: 1.26.1.1.  Provide policy and guidance on implementing the GPP. 1.26.1.2.  Establish procurement data requirements and procedures to collect data that meet reporting requirements. 1.26.1.3.  Utilize and analyze procurement data for the purpose of management evaluation of GPP performance. 1.26.1.4.  Incorporate GPP requirements into AF compliance inspection checklist. AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 39 1.26.2.  441 VSCOS will: 1.26.2.1.  Provide GPP oversight by validating program management requirements through Staff Assistance Visits and compliance inspection checklists.  (T-1). 1.26.2.2.  Recommend changes in policies or procedures to AF/A4LR to improve the GPP when necessary.  (T-1). 1.26.2.3.  Provide oversight of contracted vehicle management activity contracts to ensure green procurement requirements are addressed in accordance with the terms of the contract.  (T-1). 1.26.3.  LRS Commander or Equivalent. 1.26.3.1.  Support the Vehicle Management GPP policy and plan.  (T-0). 1.26.3.2.  Ensure  that  required  Vehicle  Management  personnel  are  trained  in  green procurement and such training is tracked and managed as necessary to ensure all personnel involved  in  the  procurement  process  are  knowledgeable  and  competent  to  comply  with green procurement requirements relevant to their procurement/purchasing action(s).   (T-0). 1.26.3.3.  Conduct routine self-assessments of the effectiveness of GPP awareness training, the completeness and integrity of GPP performance data and the overall GPP.  (T-1). 1.26.4.  Vehicle Management. 1.26.4.1.  Identify  opportunities  to  procure  green  products  and  services  in  the  normal course of business, maintain a list of such opportunities, and update the list regularly to reflect changes in the mission and availability of green products and services relevant to the  mission.  (T-0).    The  list  of  green  procurement  opportunities  will  be  developed  and maintained at a level within the activity where initial purchasing requirements are defined.  (T-0). 1.26.4.2.  Establish procedures to collect GPP data to support administrative requirements.  (T-1). 1.26.4.3.  Recommend changes in policies or procedures to 441 VSCOS  to improve the GPP when necessary.  (T-1). 1.26.4.4.  Review  and  update  GPP  every  three  years  or  sooner  if  regulations  or requirements  change,  new  products  are  designated  or  operational  changes  affect procurement.  (T-1). 1.26.4.5.  Apply service lifecycle and procurement costs when determining effectiveness of green procurement decisions.  (T-1).  One example is recap tires versus new tires.  If a new tire has a service life twice as long as a recap tire but only costs 20 percent more, then purchase of a new tire will save 40 percent overall and will be the obvious procurement choice. 1.26.4.5.1.  If  using  life  cycle  data  to  warrant  a  green  purchase  exception  (see paragraph 1.25.3.), ensure data is thorough, complete and well documented. 40 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 1.26.5.  Purchase  Request  Originator,  Purchaser  and  Supervisory  Personnel.  Includes personnel  authorized  to  order  items  using  ILS-S,  section  supervisors,  Materiel  Control personnel, Government Purchase Card (GPC) holders, supply technicians and the VFM/VMS. 1.26.5.1.  Reviewing  purchase  requests  to  determine  whether  green  products  have  been considered or requested.  (T-1). 1.26.5.2.  Determining if there is appropriate justification based on price, performance or availability for not meeting the purchasing requirements of the GPP.  (T-1). 1.26.5.3.  Ensuring  that  relevant  green  procurement  requirements  are  identified  prior  to submission  to  Material  Control  or  GPC  card  holder,  so  that  final/approved  purchase requests properly address all relevant green procurement requirements.  (T-1). 1.26.5.4.  Identifying  opportunities  for  specifying  environmentally  preferable  products.  (T-1). 1.27.  Training.  Although Green Procurement training is required for all Government Purchase Card  (GPC)  users,  Green  Procurement  training  is  also  required  for  the  VFM/VMS,  Section Supervisors, personnel assigned to Material Control and any other personnel assigned to Vehicle Management with the authority to order or purchase parts and supplies every two years IAW the DOD  Green  Procurement  Program.    “Green  Procurement”  computer-based  training  is  a Continuous  Learning  Course  (CLC  046)  available  from  the  Defense  Acquisition  University (DAU).  Once completed the course will be documented in the member‘s training record.  Go to DAU‘s iCatalog web page http://icatalog.dau.mil/ for more information and access to the course. 1.28.  Purchasing  Sources.  When  a  requirement  is  established  for  a  product  in  one  of  the categories  listed  above,  Vehicle  Management  activities  will  review  the  following  sources  for Green Products/Services (designated items): 1.28.1.  Federal Supply.  These sources would include the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) and U.S. General Service Agency (GSA) catalogs and/or websites.  Procuring items through these  sources  offers  the  advantage  of  competitive  bidding,  compliance  with  EPA  minimum content thresholds for recovered materials, and central tracking.  These sources also provide an additional service through independent  estimation,  certification and verification of EPA-designated items containing recovered material, thereby reducing overhead costs for buyers to monitor vendor compliance with affirmative procurement requirements. 1.28.1.1.  DLA.  DLA’s  “DOD  EMALL”  is  a  web-based  eCommerce  site  that  allows authorized  users  to  search,  compare,  and  purchase  commercial  and  noncommercial products  and  services  through  a  single  interface  in  an  easy-to-use  online  format.    DOD EMALL  uses  a  “green  tree”  icon  to  identify  environmentally  preferable  attributes.  Products available include re-refined lubricating oil and reclaimed engine coolant.  GPC card holder must register with  the site before product  catalogs can be viewed.  Website login is at:  https://dod-emall.dla.mil. 1.28.1.2.  GSA.  The  GSA  website  contains  a  “Green  Products  Compilation”  page  that offers a downloadable workbook as a tool to facilitate the procurement of green products.  The  Green  Products  Compilation  workbook  is  separated  into  areas  to  include  Vehicle Products  and  Lubricants,  Oils,  Hydraulic  Fluids  and  Greases.    The  workbook  can  be accessed at: http://www.gsa.gov. AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 41 for Products Information 1.28.2.  EPA-Designated  Recycled-Content  Vehicular  Products.  The  EPA  Database  of Environmental Services (http://yosemite1.epa.gov/oppt/eppstand2.nsf)  provides  a  quick  reference  guide  to  the various programs and products involved in DOD's GPP.  The EPA database provides links to contract language, specifications and policies; environmental standards and guidelines; vendor lists of product  brands;  and other useful sources of information (e.g., fact  sheets,  guidance, case  studies).    Additionally,  the  EPA’s  CPG  program  provides  details  concerning  products listed  in  the  Vehicular  Products  category,  Product  Resource  Guides  and  Product  Supplier Directories.    Go  to:  http://www.epa.gov/waste/conserve/tools/cpg/index.htm  to  access information. and 1.28.3.  USDA-Designated  Biobased  Products  .    USDA    BioPreferred®  vendors  can    be found on the USDA BioPreferred website:  http://www.biopreferred.gov.  The site contains an electronic product catalog of USDA-designated biobased products, their manufactures and locations.    Purchasing  activities  can  browse  the  catalog  by  subject.    Be  sure  to  review  all categories for potential products that fall into the procurement categories listed above. Note:   There will be some overlap between the EPA-designated items and the USDA list for biobased items.   USDA states that procurements subject to CPG requirements (EPA-designated items) do not also have to satisfy the new biobased product requirements, if the two sets of requirements are inconsistent.   However, this does not mean that EPA-designated items must automatically  be  purchased  in  place  of  biobased  purchases.   Purchasers  must  look  at  the benefits and costs of products and select the one that provides the best value overall. 1.28.4.  Local Vendors  .  Activities may also purchase designated items from local vendors provided the items have: 1) the highest percent practical biobased material practical or exceed minimum USDA Biobased standards; or 2) have the highest percentage practical of recovered material  or  comply  with  the  EPA‘s  recommended  recoverable  materials  content  ranges.  Standards and content ranges can be found under the product categories on the USDA and EPA website respectively.  Material Control or authorized purchasers must thoroughly review and exhaust internet resources to find the least expensive products that meet Green standards and matches operational/manufactures‘ requirements.  (T-0). 1.29.  Procurement Standards. 1.29.1.  Tires  .  Vehicle Management will purchase retread/recapped tires to  the maximum extent practical before new tires are purchased from any source IAW Executive Order 12873, Federal Acquisition, Recycling & Waste Reduction.  (T-0).  Procuring activities will establish preference programs consisting of one or both components listed below.  (T-0). 1.29.1.1.  Procurement of tire retreading services for the agencies' used tire casings.  The EPA recommends that procuring agencies specify that tire repair and retread services must conform to Federal Specification ZZ-T-441H (or current version). 1.29.1.2.  Procurement  of  tires  through  competition  between  vendors  of  new  tires  and vendors of retread tires.  The EPA recommends that procuring agencies specify that retread tires must meet  the requirements of Federal  Specification  ZZ-T-381, "Tires, Pneumatic, Vehicular (Highway) (New and Retreaded). 42 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 1.29.2.  Refer  to  DLA-Columbus,  Cooperative  Approved  Tire  List  (CATL-1922),  current edition,  for  a  list  of  approved  Cooperative  Tire  Qualification  Program  (CQTP)  retread  tire manufactures. Note:    There  is  no  legal  requirement  or  national  government  policy  mandate  for  government agencies to use the CTQP or CATL list when purchasing retread tires. 1.29.3.  Engine  Coolants  .    Vehicle  Management  will  use/procure  recycled/reclaimed coolants  (antifreeze)  to  the  maximum  extent  possible.    Manufacturer  specifications  must specifically state that recycled/reclaimed antifreeze can be used in the vehicle.  (T-1). 1.29.3.1.  Vehicle  Management  may  establish  a  program  for  engine  coolant  reclamation (recycling) and reuse that consists of either reclaiming the spent engine coolants onsite or establishing  a  service  contract  for  reclamation  of  the  spent  engine  coolant  for  use  in vehicles. 1.29.3.2.  Vehicle  Management  may  purchase  reclaimed  engine  coolant  when  making direct purchases of this item, such as when necessary to make up for losses due to leakage or spillage. 1.29.3.3.1.  Using recycled/reclaimed antifreeze would void the warranty.  However, recycled/reclaimed antifreeze will be used if it meets the manufacturer’s specifications. Note:  After the warranty period expires recycled/reclaimed antifreeze MUST be used exclusively if approved by the vehicle‘s manufacturer.  (T-1).  Tech data must specifically state that recycled/reclaimed antifreeze is approved for use in the vehicle.  (T-1). 1.29.3.3.2.  Some  heavy  equipment  manufacturers  do  not  recommend  the  use  of reclaimed engine coolants, particularly in engines meeting the new Tier II and Tier III emissions  requirements,  e.g.,  the  Halverson  loader  coolant  requirement  prevents  the use of recycled/reclaimed antifreeze.  Be sure to check manufacturer's specifications on the use of recycled/reclaimed antifreeze. 1.29.3.4.  DLA Defense Supply Center Richmond (DSCR) sells both reclaimed and virgin engine coolant.  DSCR requires that reclaimed engine coolant contain a minimum of 50 percent  reclaimed  ethylene  glycol.    DSCR  offers  reclaimed  engine  coolants  containing either  100  percent  reclaimed  ethylene  glycol  or  60  percent  and  50  percent  blends  of reclaimed and virgin ethylene glycol.  As shown in Table 1.1., Reclaimed Engine Coolant Available from DLA, each blend is  available in 1-gallon, 5-gallon and 55-gallon  drum packaging, for a total of nine stock items.  These products can be used in administrative vehicles, construction and material handling vehicles and equipment, and military ground combat  tactical  vehicles  and  equipment.    DSCR  currently  contracts  with  Leeder Automotive for reclaimed engine coolant. AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 Table 1.1.  Reclaimed Engine Coolants Available from DLA. 43  1.29.4.  Hydraulic Fluids.  Mobile Equipment, hydraulic fluids formulated for general use in non-stationary  equipment,  such  as  tractors,  end  loaders  or  backhoes  -  44%  -  Minimum Biobased Content. 1.29.5.  Greases-Truck.  Lubricants  composed  of  oils  thickened  to  a  semisolid  or  solid consistency  using  soaps,  polymers  or  other  solids,  or  other  thickeners.  Lubricants  that  are designed for use on the fifth wheel of tractor trailer trucks onto which the semi-trailer rests and pivots - 71% Minimum Biobased Content. 1.29.6.  Sorbents.  Materials formulated for use in the cleanup and automotive, industrial, or kitchen soils and oils, including grease, paint, and other coatings, from hard surfaces - 89% Minimum Biobased Content. 1.29.7.  Re-refined Oil  .  Vehicle Management will use/procure re-refined lubricating oil to the maximum extent possible.  (T-0).  The EPA recommends that procuring agencies set their minimum re-refined oil content standard at the highest level of re-refined oil, but no lower than 25 percent re-refined oil.  Re-refined oil purchased through DLA meets that standard.  DOD policy dictates that DLA automatically substitute re-refined oil when activities order certain grades of commercial oil.  (T-0). 1.29.7.1.  Vehicle management activities purchasing oil from sources other than DLA must comply with the legal requirements to use re-refined oil, meeting the re-refined oil content specified above, and is reminded that the central supply system is the preferred method of purchasing supplies.  (T-0). 1.29.7.2.  Approved  re-refined  oil,  which  can  be  used  in  most  AF  vehicles,  will  meet current American Petroleum Institute (API) standards, evidenced by the "Starburst" symbol on the container.  (T-1). 1.29.7.3.  Do not purchase or arrange for purchase of any virgin motor oil when a re-refined alternative is readily available and meets vehicle manufacturer recommended performance standards. 1.29.7.4.  Model year 2007 and newer diesel engines with new emissions requirements may use virgin API CJ-4 motor oil until it is available as a re-refined product. 44 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 1.29.7.5.  Use  of  synthetic  oils  may  extend  component  life,  reduce  oil  consumption  and minimize  the  waste  stream.

(T-1).  Agreement would include procedure for reimbursable aspects of maintenance support (e.g., parts and local contracted support/repairs).  (T-1). 1.33.  Defense  Property  Accountability  System  (DPAS).  DPAS  is  the  fleet  management information  system  (FMIS)  approved  by  the  Office  of  the  Under  Secretary  of  Defense  for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (OUSD AT&L).  Per policy memorandum “DOD Non-Tactical Fleet Management Information System” dated 1 April 2014, use of any other FMIS must be approved by OSD via waiver request.  Implementing the DPAS solution will require the Air Force to sunset the existing maintenance system On-line Vehicle Interactive Management System (OLVIMS) as well as migrating vehicle accountability from AF Equipment Management System (AFEMS) and Standard Base Supply System (SBSS) into DPAS; which is independently operated and hosted on the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) production environment.  It has already  been  determined  that  DPAS  meets  requirements  to  support  implementing  the capabilities/requirements  outlined  in  the  Vehicle  Enterprise,  Services  Development  Delivery Process (SDDP) need statement.  DPAS will be used by the AF Vehicle Management community as the primary system for performing all life-cycle management functions pertaining to the ground vehicle fleet including agency owned and leased assets. 1.33.1.  DPAS  Implementation.    This  effort  consists  of  a  single  phase  approach  with capabilities  to  plan,  schedule,  and  execute  Vehicle  Management  processes.  This  effort represents a distinct set of capabilities which can stand alone upon implementation. 1.33.2.  Fleet  Management  &  Analysis.    This  effort  concentrates  on  migrating  functions currently  performed  by  fleet  managers  pertaining  to  both  accountability  and  work  order processing.    The  three  systems  used  today  are  OLVIMS,  AFEMS  and  ILS-S.    OLVIMS involves work order, labor tracking, costing and calculations; this translates to the Maintenance and  Utilization  (M&U)  module  in  DPAS.    Additionally,  vehicle  inventory  records  and accountable transactions currently preformed in ILS-S will also be subsumed to DPAS in the Accountability  Property  module.    AFEMS  is  the  authoritative  source  for  the  vehicle allowances; this is also available in the Accountability Property module. 1.33.3.  Materiel Control.  Another area are the tasks performed in the Materiel Control work center,  this  entails  parts  acquisition,  consumable  replenishments  and  tool  issuing/tracking.  Today, there is not a standard system utilized for Materiel Control but this capability will be managed in the Warehouse module in DPAS. 1.33.4.  Vehicle Maintenance Technicians.  This effort adds the capability for technicians to perform live updates on assigned work orders. This will require the additional 5K users to be trained and granted access but reduces the requirement to print hard copy work orders.  (T-0).  Additionally,  441  VSCOS  continues  to  streamline  the  data  upload  process,  requesting engineering  assistance  to  resolve  technical  constraints,  engineer  products  and,  technical processes needed for management of vehicles. AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 47 Chapter 2 VEHICLE MANAGEMENT CONTINGENCY OPERATIONS Section 2A—General Information  2.1.

Repair Operations:  Although difficult to predict the actual operating environment at a contingency location, it is possible to exercise personnel in a simulated or practice deployment. 2.9.1.1.  Deployable personnel need to be prepared for flexible operations  under adverse conditions.  They must also be well trained in the use of all tools and shop equipment. 2.9.1.2.  Pre-deployment training is not required unless specifically addressed via tasking “Line Remarks”. 2.9.2.  Contingency  Environment:    Operations  in  a  contingency  environment  will  expose vehicle  maintainers  to  many  situations  and  problems  not  encountered  in  normal  peacetime operations.  Training provides the required knowledge and skills to plan for, respond to, and recover from conventional and irregular warfare CBRNE events.  To complement the training, installations  must  include  realistic  exercises  and  scenarios  demonstrating  the  level  of proficiency required for operating in a contingency environment and for evaluation purposes.   Refer to AFMAN 10-2503 for additional training information. 2.10.  WRM Vehicle Storage.  WRM vehicles are authorized and maintained separately from the active peacetime vehicle fleet and are normally preserved in storage.  IAW AFI 25-101 the WRM WG  evaluates  storage  and  maintenance  concepts,  while  the  WRM  Manager  is  responsible  for overseeing storage requirements for WRM vehicles assigned to the organization. Note:  Specific storage concepts for FSE are at the direction of the Global WRM Management office. 2.10.1.  Vehicles are stored in active (ready to roll) or inactive (deep stored) categories.  For basic planning, the following guidance applies: 2.10.1.1.  Active stored vehicles:  Vehicles stored outdoors, under partial cover or vehicles required to support initial incoming forces are preserved to Level C as described in TO 36-1-191. 2.10.1.2.  Inactive  stored  vehicles:    Vehicles  will  be  stored  in  an  enclosed  building  and preserved to Level A storage as described in TO 36-1-191.  (T-1). 2.10.2.  Vehicles are controlled according to AFI 25-101, as supplemented. 2.10.3.  DELETE. 2.10.4.  WRM  vehicles  are  rotated  into  the  active  peacetime  fleet  (where  like-vehicle peacetime authorizations exist) to ensure equipment dependability/life cycle management and to equalize utilization. 52 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 2.10.5.  Develop a parking plan for each storage location. 2.10.6.  Fire extinguishers and chocks are mounted to or located in each vehicle, or positioned in the vehicle storage area. 2.10.7.  When inside storage cannot be provided, outside storage areas that are well lit, have adequate drainage and are secured by a chain link or equivalent fence may be used. 2.10.8.  Exceptions to Storage Policies.  Fuel servicing, fire fighting, aircraft cargo loaders and certain other vehicles are equipped with systems that must be exercised more frequently.  To the maximum extent practicable, fully exercise operational systems on these vehicles every 30 days. 2.11.  WRM Manpower Determination.  Vehicle Management and Manpower Office consider the following factors when developing manpower requirements supporting vehicle storage: 2.11.1.  The quantity and complexity of vehicles to be stored (vehicle equivalents). 2.11.2.  The storage level (active storage requires more manpower than inactive storage). 2.11.3.  Frequency of inspection and the average amount of time required for each inspection. 2.11.4.  Age of the Fleet.  Older vehicles may require more maintenance than pre-positioned new vehicles. 2.11.5.  The degree and frequency of vehicle fleet involvement  in exercises (that is, used to support Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), intra-theater or local exercises). 2.11.6.  Rotation.  This will affect the number of Limited Technical Inspections (LTI) required. 2.11.7.  If applicable, the amount of time required for vehicles to be placed in or removed from storage. 2.11.8.  Hours of operational coverage, e.g., 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. 2.11.9.  Material  handling  and  surface  movement  of  cargo  to,  from  and  between  operating locations in support of surge and sustainment operations at bare base versus fixed facilities. 2.11.10.  Fleet size for management and dispersed locations. 2.12.  Contractor Operated Storage.  Contractor operated storage is the AF Standard.  Explore the use of military personnel only if local environment and political conditions prevent contract establishment.    Vehicle  Management  and  Manpower  Office  also  consider  manpower  ceilings, contractor  availability,  cost,  location,  and  duration  of  storage  as  governing  factors.    Assign technically  competent  (7-level  personnel  in  AFSC  2T3)  AF  vehicle  repair  technicians  as Contracting  Officer  Representative  (COR)  and  ensure  COR-specific  training  is  provided.    See Chapter 9 for additional information on COR. Section 2D—Transition to Surge/Deployment Preparation  2.13.  Personnel. 2.13.1.  Closely review all deployment tasking MISCAPs and line-remarks.  Current MISCAP information  can  be  obtained  from  the  Unit  Deployment  Manager  (UDM).    Contact  the Installation Deployment Officer (IDO) for assistance if UDM is unavailable. AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 53 2.13.1.1.  The MISCAP describes the performance level required by the tasked UTC.  The tasked  unit  is  responsible  for  ensuring  deploying  personnel  can  meet  all  MISCAP requirements. 2.13.2.  If the unit cannot support the tasking, forward a shortfall request through appropriate channels immediately. 2.13.3.  Personnel with AFSCs 2T3X1, 2T3X1A, and 2T3X1C will be prepared to deploy with an ITK of standard and metric hand tools as directed by line-remarks.  (T-1).  ITK must also include  any  AFSC-specific  tools  required  to  fulfill  possible  MISCAP  requirements.    (T-1).  See VM Neighborhood for recommended items. Note:  ITKs must be assembled as light and compact as reasonably possible to help ensure commercial air transportation capability.  Some domestic flights may have a 50-pound weight limit.  Ensure excess baggage allowance is authorized on deploying member’s orders if the member is deploying with an ITK. 2.13.3.1.  Personnel with AFSCs 2T371, 2T390 will be prepared to deploy with minimum publications and forms listed on VM Neighborhood if directed to do so.  (T-1).  Ensure all publications and forms are the most current versions.  (T-1).  Electronic copies (CD, external hard-drives, etc.) are preferable if computer support capable of reading media is confirmed. 2.13.4.  Personnel  with  AFSC 2T3X7 will be prepared to  deploy  with  an  ITK consisting of laptop, all-in-one printer/  scanner/fax, 30 days of administrative office supplies and  current versions  of  electronic  publications  and  forms  listed  on  VM  Neighborhood  if  specifically directed by line-remarks.

(T-2).    Laptop  will  be  exercised  before  departure  to  ensure  full serviceability and internet access capability.  (T-1).  A compatible printer with extra ink or toner cartridges will accompany the Fleet Management & Analysis (FM&A) laptop.  (T-1).  Go to VM Neighborhood for additional 2T3X7 ITK list/guidance. 2.13.4.2.  If  required,  the  deploying  unit  will  send  an  in-use  OLVIMS  computer  and printer.    Replacement  computers  can  be  easily  sourced  for  home  station  use.    It  is imperative  the  deploying  members  be  able  to  establish  and  operate  OLVIMS  at  the deployed location as soon as practical. 2.13.5.  Deploying units may also be tasked to assemble and ship an ITK to support Materiel Control operations.  The ITK will consist of items listed on VM Neighborhood.  The ITK will include administrative office supplies and current versions of electronic publications and forms listed  in  the  VM  Neighborhood,  unless  specially  authorized  to  deviate  by  C-NAF/C-MAJCOM.  (T-2). 2.13.6.  The C-NAF/C-MAJCOM may direct  ITKs for all AFSCs to  be left  in  place during rotations.  If this happens, the C-NAF/C-MAJCOM must notify inbound forces that ITKs are not required for that operating location. 2.13.7.  Mobility  processing  functions  are  responsible  for  ensuring  each  deploying  member has all required individual equipment.  Items such as steel toe boots, safety glasses/goggles, 54 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 reflective  belts  and  hearing  protection  are  mandatory.    (T-0).    Refer  to  list  on  VM Neighborhood  for  suggested  individual  deployment  items  member  consider  taking  if  not directed to or issued. 2.14.  TMSK. 2.14.1.  If approved by higher headquarters or stated as a line-remark on Vehicle Redistribution Order (RDO), deploying vehicles will be shipped with a TMSK.  (T-1). 2.14.2.  Each TMSK assembled is designed to support one vehicle for 30 days with common and high-use items  in  the event  of minor malfunctions before the supply  chain  and/or shop stocks are established at the deployed/forward location.  Refer to VM Neighborhood for an example listing of possible TMSK items. 2.14.3.  TMSKs  are  individually  assembled,  boxed,  and  shipped  within  the  cab,  trunk,  and truck bed or on the forks of each vehicle, if physically possible.  If this is not feasible, consider placing the most critical items (TO and critical parts) in the cab or other vehicle compartments.  If items shipped inside the vehicle are not readily visible (e.g., inside high reach or telephone maintenance truck compartments), identify location with a prominently placed label.  Over-sized kits must be shipped IAW paragraph 2.16 to ensure the kit arrives at the same location with the vehicle. 2.14.3.1.  If more than one vehicle of the same type is deploying to the same location, those kits can be consolidated into a larger kit.  When consolidating kits, quantities and breadth of the kits must be increased.  This ensures availability of items if vehicles are redistributed, diverted or forward deployed. 2.14.4.  Mark each TMSK exterior with vehicle make, model, registration number, shipping unit,  gaining  unit  (if  known)  and  shipping  unit  POC  with  Defense  Switch  Network  (DSN) phone number.  Each TMSK item inside the kit will be individually labeled with part number, NSN, description, vehicle type and model year. 2.14.5.  DELETED. 2.15.  Tools and Equipment Deployment. 2.15.1.  Vehicle  Management  leadership  at  all  levels  are  to  be  aware  of  2T3XX  UTC tasking(s).  This information is available from the UDM, base-level Readiness Flight or the MAJCOM Logistics Plans and Readiness function. 2.15.2.  Tasked units build and deploy tool and equipment kits from host Vehicle Management shops as necessary to meet wartime tasking(s) when directed by line-remarks or spelled out tasking  order.    (T-1).    UTC  UFMXK,  Transportation  Vehicle  Management  Support  Kit,  is designed to support Vehicle Management operations for 30 days.  If the UFMXK support kit exceeds 45 days of being deployed, the owning unit UDM/IDO will inquire as to the status of the kit to determine if it will be permanently transferred to the deployed locations equipment account.  (T-1).  If the kit is transferred, the owning unit's equipment account must be cleared, seek funds reimbursement through Resource Advisor, and begin to re-constitute a replacement kit.  (T-1). Note:  Verify required contents with UDM or IDO.  The most current inventory list can be accessed in Logistics Module (LOGMOD).  Additional items for unique situations can only be added after MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staff’s approval. AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 55 2.15.3.  DELETED. 2.15.4.

For all “unassigned forces vehicle sourcing” in response to RFFs, AFPC sends requests  to  ACC/A4RF  to  provide  sourcing  by  Unit  Identification  Code  (UIC).  ACC/A4RF  sends  request  to  441  VSCOS  who  in  turn  reviews  required  delivery dates/location to identify the most efficient way (cost/time/lift) to support the request. Note:  As AMC is the lead for Non-Airborne aircraft loader weapons systems, 441 VSCOS coordinates with AMC to provide sourcing solutions for those type assets upon receipt of RFF. 2.16.1.8.  For all “assigned forces vehicle sourcing” with RDD greater than 72 hours from notification, the tasked C-NAF/C-MAJCOM will send request to 441 VSCOS who in turn reviews required delivery dates/location to identify the most efficient way (cost/time/lift) to support the request. 2.16.1.8.1.  For taskings with an RDD within 72 hours of notification, the tasked C-NAF/C-MAJCOM  will  develop  the  sourcing  solution  if  441  VSCOS  cannot  be contacted within one-hour of notification.  The tasked C-NAF/C-MAJCOM will then notify the users of sourced vehicles and 441 VSCOS as soon as possible. 2.16.1.9.  In all vehicle sourcing efforts 441 VSCOS will coordinate with using and owning MAJCOMs to ensure there are no operational impacts as a result of vehicle taskings.  (T-1). 2.16.1.10.  441 VSCOS coordination with AFPC validates TPFDD tasking and the request systematically  flows  to  tasked  base/unit  via  Deliberate  and  Crisis  Action  Planning  and Execution  Segment  (DCAPES).    441  VSCOS  also  provides  tasking  and  shipping information to VFM/VMS based on TPFDD and advises VFM/VMS to contact IDO and/or UDM  for  specific  tasking  details/timelines  that  are  not  generally  passed  via  non-secure networks. 2.16.1.11.

If shipped data and/or keys are not readily visible, identify location with a prominently placed label. 2.16.8.1.  FM&A personnel will ensure the agency directing the vehicle shipment provides the Emergency and Special Program (ESP) code, or written approval from the appropriate transportation  account  code  (TAC)  manager,  to  charge  shipping  costs  and  that  this documentation accompanies the vehicle shipping package when the asset is delivered to the Deployment and Distribution Flight (DDF).  (T-2). 2.16.8.2.  A  final  “hands-on”  inspection  by  the  VFM/VMS  or  designated  representative and  his/her  signature  is  required  on  LTI  prior  to  release  for  shipment  from  the  Vehicle Management Flight. 2.16.9.  Prepped vehicles are delivered to the Cargo Deployment Function (CDF) or DDF as directed by local policy.  Vehicle Management may be responsible for transporting TMSKs if not affixed to the vehicle.  The Installation Deployment Plan will provide additional guidance on air and surface shipment standards and deploying unit UDM responsibilities.  (T-1). 2.16.10.  Any vehicle or equipment shipped against a TPFDD tasking will have a contingency TCN automatically  generated from  the  LOGMOD  IAW AFI 10-403, Deployment  Planning and Execution. (T-1).  The UDM or IDO will be able to determine if a vehicle is tasked against the  TPFDD.  (T-1).    The  TCN  for  a  TPFDD  shipment    begins  with  “FF”  when  generated correctly. 2.16.10.1.  If LOGMOD is unavailable, use the following guidance to ensure correct TCNs have been manually generated:  The TCN for each vehicle is built using the ULN from the TPFDD.  Contingency TCNs are identified by “$” symbols in the 7th and 8th position of the 17-character data element.  Refer to Defense Transportation Regulation (DTR) 4500.9-R, Part II, Cargo Movement, June 2008, and Part III, Mobility, July 2011, for additional guidance. 2.16.10.2.  Any vehicle or vehicular equipment not shipped against a TPFDD tasking will have a standard TCN created.  (T-1).  Do not have a standard TCN created for a TPFDD-tasked vehicle shipment.  (T-1). 2.16.11.  Vehicle Management will closely coordinate with deploying unit UDM when TMSK is not affixed to the vehicle.  TMSKs shipped with, but not attached to, vehicles are moved as multi-piece  shipments.    Ensure  pieces  are  correctly  marked  (i.e.,  item  2  of  2)  against shipment’s contingency TCN.  Also, ensure the proper priority and Required Delivery Date (RDD) is assigned to all TMSKs that are shipped separately.  This ensures the kit will arrive in time to support the vehicle if needed. 2.16.11.1.  This data is entered into the Cargo Movement Operations System (CMOS) or Global  Air  Transportation  Execution  System  (GATES)  and  initiates  ITV  through  the Global Transportation Network (GTN). 2.16.12.

A contingency Emergency and Special Program (ESP) code may be available for reimbursement. 2.18.1.2.  Training.    Prior  to  deployment,  accelerate  5-level  upgrade  training  while  the majority of trainers are still available.  Compensate for reduced capability by training non-deploying  members  in  critical  shop  operations.    This  should  help  maximize  shop productivity during heavy deployment periods. 2.18.2.  Shop Operations. 2.18.2.1.  FM&A  will  develop  and  implement  a  vehicle-parking  plan  when  required.  Identify serviceable, non- essential vehicles to  be parked.   (T-1).   Identification method could be from across the base, focused on deploying unit‘s vehicle fleet, commander‘s or equivalent‘s option or by number/type of mechanics deployed.  If the last option is selected, compute the total number of vehicle equivalents earned by the deploying mechanics, then park the proper fleet mix based on the total vehicle equivalents.  Extensive coordination with  base  leadership  must  occur  before  implementing  any  type  of  parking  plan.    The following guidance must be used if a parking plan is implemented. 2.18.2.1.1.  The vehicles are to be stored in a controlled and monitored environment.  They must be parked for the duration of the deployment.  A parking plan and map are recommended. 2.18.2.1.2.  Ensure parked vehicles are preserved to the appropriate storage level IAW TO 36-1-191. 2.18.2.1.3.  Do not cannibalize from parked vehicles. 2.18.2.2.  Focus on quality of maintenance performed.  Use the approved vehicle Minimum Essential Levels (MEL) and paragraph 3.32. as a gauge to develop maintenance priorities and establish in-house MC rate goals.  Established goals will be thoroughly briefed and approved by the commander. AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 59 2.18.2.3.  Contract  Maintenance.    Preplanning  potential  contract  maintenance  is  crucial.  Contact local Contracting Office to set up Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) or short-term maintenance contracts.  Maximize use of ESP codes for funding support. 2.18.2.4.  ISSA.  If available, contact local DOD components or government maintenance operations.    Discuss  establishing  an  ISSA  for  Vehicle  Management  support  during contingencies and/or AEF rotations.  Ensure any ISSA address AF unique requirements for priority, types of maintenance and quality of services. Section 2E—Deployed Location Operations 2.19.  VFM/VMS.  After  the  initial  phase  of  all  contingencies,  the  deployed  VFM/VMS implements  responsibilities  outlined  in  Chapter  1  and  Chapter  3  of  this  instruction  at  the deployed  location.    When  the  deployed  LRS  does  not  have  a  VFM/VMS  assigned,  the  senior ranking military member with AFSC 2T3XX assumes those duties. 2.20.  Safety.

Facilities. 2.26.1.  Facilities  at  forward  operating  locations  may  consist  of  host  nation  buildings, expandable structures, tents, or other appropriate mobile units.  Vehicle Management facilities support PM&I, Special Inspections, unscheduled and intermediate levels of maintenance.  Care needs to be taken in planning to include utilities (electric and water), wash facilities, exhaust ventilation  and  a  compressed  air  source.    For  planning  purposes,  shop-working  areas  must accommodate approximately 5 percent of the fleet at one time in addition to ancillary functions. (T-1).  Refer to AFMAN 32-1084, Facility Requirements, for exact space authorization. 2.26.2.  The Vehicle Management facility is a component of the AS 159 (Basic Expeditionary Airfield  Resources  (BEAR)  Order  of  Battle)  BEAR  Vehicle  Maintenance/Operations  UTC (XF*VC).  It comes in two different configurations, either Air (XFAVC) or Surface (XFSVC).  It is specifically for Vehicle Maintenance, Vehicle Operations and Management Operations.  This  UTC  comes  with  one  small  shelter.    For  “maintenance”  operations  task  two  each  4K Dome UTCs (XF*AB - also comes in Air or Surface) along with AM-2 Matting (XF*AM) for flooring. 2.26.3.  When  geographically  feasible,  facilities  must  be  accessible  to  the  key  functions supported, e.g., sortie-generating (flight  line) and Air Terminal  Operations Center (ATOC).  (T-1).  It may be necessary to establish dispersed Vehicle Management locations. 2.26.4.  A  separate  facility  for  refueling  vehicles  is  highly  desired.    Some  contingency locations may not have the capability to establish a separate Refueling Maintenance facility.  Those  operating  locations  may  be  forced  by  necessity  to  combine  maintenance  operations.  Combined  maintenance  operations  can  only  be  conducted  under  strict  adherence  to  the following guidelines: 2.26.4.1.  Applies only to vehicles transporting diesel or aviation fuel. 2.26.4.2.  Properly train all assigned personnel in fuels management safety procedures. 2.26.4.3.  Maximum of one fuel truck inside shop at any time.  (T-1).  Repairs and service will be limited to the actual prime mover only (chassis, exterior, drive train, etc.).  (T-1). 2.26.4.4.  Properly ground vehicle using the vehicle’s static discharge grounding reel. 2.26.4.5.  No smoking, spark or flame within 50 feet of vehicle or shop area.  (T-0). 2.26.4.6.  DELETED. 2.26.4.7.  A truck or trailer mounted refueling system will not be opened inside the main shop.  (T-1).  Repairs and service will be limited to the actual prime mover only (chassis, exterior,  drive  train,  etc.).    (T-1).    Refueling  system  repairs  must  be  accomplished  in designated area/shop and will not be accomplished inside a combined Vehicle Management shop.    (T-1).    Drain  refueling  system‘s  fuel  storage  tank  as  much  as  possible  prior  to entering shop to reduce mass spill potential.  (T-1).  If the storage tank/system cannot be 62 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 drained, ensure fuel system is completely closed and there are no leaks before entering the shop.  Comply with all installation spill containment procedures.  (T-1). 2.27.  Tools and Equipment: 2.27.1.  UTC UFMXK, Vehicle Management Support Kit (see paragraph 2.15.2), is designed to support maintenance operations at a bare base location in the 1-30 day range.  It is a light, lean, air transportable kit limited to one aircraft pallet position.  Contact local DDF, ATOC, Reception  Control  Center,  C-MAJCOM/NAF  to  determine  the  UTCs  actual  location.    If known, the TCN expedites tracking efforts. 2.27.2.  DELETED 2.28.  Parts Organization.  Assorted vehicle parts may be on hand from vehicle TMSKs and/or UTC UFMXK packages.  It is imperative that all parts be inventoried and organized as soon as possible.  Parts must be secured at any time the shop is unoccupied. (T-1). 2.29.  Organizational Maintenance.  Increased level of operator maintenance is essential during wartime.  Although this expanded role of operation is viewed as a battlefield reality, the vehicle mechanic will continue to perform the bulk of the intermediate maintenance workload.  The scope of  increased  operator  maintenance  and  level  of  maintenance  support  (parts,  tools,  etc.)  is determined by the using organization’s VCO/VCNCO and the local VFM/VMS. 2.30.  Mobile  Maintenance.  The  number  of  Mobile  Maintenance  vehicles  needed  depends  on size and scope of operation, mission, location and threat.  Vehicles may be tasked to set-up as a base of operations in an alternate location if main shop is destroyed.  Vehicles must be adequately set-up for any possible tasking. (T-3). 2.30.1.  Expanded Mobile Maintenance.  On-scene support is the goal of this concept.  When implemented,  the  expanded  Mobile  Maintenance  concept  positions  Vehicle  Management personnel in key areas throughout the base to provide quicker response to major users as well as  dispersed  Vehicle  Management  assets.    An  example  may  be  positioning  a  Mobile Maintenance  vehicle  at  or  near  an  aircraft  ramp  area  in  support  of  air  freight  or  aircraft maintenance vehicles if a permanent outlying shop cannot be established and/or fully manned. Note:  Ensure Mobile Maintenance vehicle fuel tank level is always maintained above ½ tank.  Fuel shortages, enemy action or increased Force Protection Condition (FPCON) may interfere with resupply actions. 2.31.  Vehicle  Recovery.  Vehicle  Operations  normally  provides  this  service  though  it  may  be performed by Vehicle Management as locally determined.  Ensure only qualified personnel operate wreckers if local guidance requires Vehicle Management to perform this function. 2.32.  Minor/Intermediate Maintenance.  If a maintenance capability does not exist at deployed locations,  a  minimum  essential  maintenance  capability  is  established  using  the  following guidelines: 2.32.1.  PM&I  and  special  inspections  are  performed  only  if  the  capability  exists  and operational mission tempo allows. 2.32.2.  To  the  maximum  extent,  unscheduled  maintenance  is  accomplished  at  dispersed locations prior to the onset of hostilities. AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 63 2.32.3.  During  contingency  situations,  repairs  not  affecting  safe  operation  or  operational capabilities may be deferred or waived.  The senior on-site 2T3XX maintenance technician determines acceptable vehicle safety and serviceability standards. 2.32.4.  Extensive use of cannibalization may be required to  compensate for parts shortages and the uncertainty of resupply. 2.33.  Repairs Which Exceed Local  Capability:  Contact C-NAF/C-MAJCOM for procedures when repairs exceed local capability (including other military and contract sources). 2.34.  Battle Damage Assessment.  All assigned personnel must be familiar with vehicle battle damage assessment.  (T-1).  They must be able to respond and assess vehicle damage caused by air and  ground attacks.   (T-1).   All  battle damage assessments need to  be reported through the appropriate  channels  and  relayed  to  the  installation  leadership.    Fast  and  accurate  damage assessment is the key to critical decision making.  Refer to TO 36-1-181, Recovery/Battle Damage Assessment and Repair, for additional reference information. 2.35.  Vehicle Triage.  Closely related to damage assessment, and done in conjunction with it, is vehicle triage.  Based normally on Priority I and II vehicle MELs, triage is accomplished as part of the damage assessment process.  Triage is the process of assessing damage, putting the priority vehicles  first,  and  doing  cannibalization  or  whatever  it  takes  to  get  those  vehicles  back  in commission.  TO 36-1-191 standards may be waived as necessary during active conflict.  Field repairs  may  be  the  norm.    Many  vehicles  can  still  do  their  job  without  a fender  or  non-critical part/component.  Refer to TO 36-1-181 for additional reference information. 2.36.  Destroyed  Vehicle  Replacement:  Vehicles  may  be  destroyed  or  rendered  unusable  by conventional,  chemical,  biological,  radiological  or  nuclear  weapons  during  combat.    Rotate vehicles from lower to higher priority authorizations to maintain base operations.  (T-2).  Leasing may  be  required  to  fill  shortages.    Contact  441  VSCOS  AF  component  to  obtain  replacement vehicles if necessary. 2.37.  Maintaining  Other  Government  Motor  Vehicle  Conveyances  (OGMVC) in Contingency  Environments.  All  OGMVCs  will  be  inspected  and  maintained  to  manufacturer specifications.  (T-0).    This  ensures  both  safe  operations  and  full  life  expectancy  from  AF equipment.  Owning organizations will have OGMVCs and non-ILS-S (not on a vehicle account) reportable  LSVs maintained through a local  vendor contract.    If a local  contract  is  not  a viable option, Vehicle Management will be responsible for maintaining these assets as workload permits.  (T-1). 2.38.  Continuity.  At  enduring  locations,  establish  continuity  books,  folders,  files,  etc.  as appropriate for the location.  (T-1).  Continuity is the key to seamless transition as personnel are replaced.    Confusion  over  local/unique  Vehicle  Management  procedures  can  create  delays  in personnel  departure,  cause  inefficient  repair  operations  and  hamper  mission  accomplishment.  Sample  information  can  be  located  at  the  VM  Neighborhood/ACC/USAFCENT  Contingency Units folder. 2.39.  Contaminated  Environment  Operations.  Detailed  guidance  for  Vehicle  Management operations in a CBRNE environment are contained in AFMAN 10-2503. 2.40.  Contamination Control Team (CCT).  Unit CCT activation is not normally required for wartime  immediate  and  operational  levels  of  decontamination.    All  personnel  are  expected  to 64 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 perform  these  levels  of  decontamination  using  the  M291  and  M295  decontamination  kits  or expedient  methods.    Vehicle,  equipment,  munitions,  aircraft  maintenance  and  base  populace personnel are expected to execute immediate and operational decontamination on their assigned assets.    The  installation  commander  will  have  to  decide  if  the  accomplishment  of  thorough decontamination  is  likely  to  produce  an  operationally-beneficial  result,  and  if  the  time  and resources  required  conducting  decontamination  operations  is  worth  the  effort  to  increase operational tempo or reduce the MOPP level.  The installation commander will determine if there is  a  need  for  an  installation  CCT  or  if  those  units  identified  to  establish  CCTs  are  required  to conduct those decontamination operations.  For example, if there are a large number of vehicles that must be decontaminated; the installation commander can decide to have the LRS conduct the decontamination operation or set up a team from several base agencies with an LRS representative to  oversee  the  operation.  Teams  will  receive  just-in-time  training  from  the  Readiness  and Emergency Management Flight when the requirement for CCTs is established. Additional CCT guidance is contained in AFMAN 10-2503. 2.41.  Hazardous    Material    (HAZMAT).  Coordinate  with  the  Civil  Engineering  (CE) Environmental  Section  and  HAZMART  Pharmacy  for  the  purchase  of  HAZMAT  and  waste storage containers if the site is projected to remain open more than 30 days.  (T-1).  Also coordinate procedures  for  collection  and  disposal  of  hazardous  waste  with  the  CE  Environmental  Section.  Download Material Safety Data Sheets/Safety Data Sheets for HAZMAT used in the work center from the website: https://hmirsmsds.logisticsinformationservice.dla.mil/HMIRS. 2.41.1.  Units stationed or deployed in the EUCOM AOR must comply with HAZMAT and hazardous waste programs established under DOD 4715.05G, DOD Overseas Environmental Baseline  Guidance  Document  (OEBGD),  and  the  final  governing  standards  for  specific countries  in  the  EUCOM  AOR.  (T-0).    Additionally,  units  preparing  or  moving  hazardous material or hazardous waste on or crossing public roads must follow USAFEI 23-104, USAFE Command Dangerous Goods Program. (T-1).  Units may contact USAFE AFCEC/CFEE for country specific guidance. 2.42.  Forward  Vehicle  Deployment.  Forward  vehicle  deployment  refers  to  moving  vehicles from  one  forward  operating  location  to  new  or  captured  bases.    The  unit  may  have  minimal response time to meet forward deployment tasking(s).  New or captured bases will be operating with minimal support functions.  It is imperative that the best vehicles and equipment are forward deployed.  To ensure full MC; the following vehicle shipment standards apply: 2.42.1.  Perform an LTI and service all fluid systems.  Vehicle must be safe and serviceable.  Vehicle must be able to perform assigned mission with no or very minimal support.  Vehicle will  be  shipped  with  an  assembled  spare  wheel/tire  and  all  applicable  TOs.    Commercially designed  light  and  medium  duty  vehicles  and  military  designed  prime  movers  must  be equipped with lug wrench(es), jack and jack handle. 2.42.2.  Assemble TMSK as directed.  See paragraph 2.14. for TMSK shipment guidance. 2.42.3.  Secure  OLVIMS  data,  TOs  and  spare  key(s)  in  cab  or  operator’s  compartment.  Shipping base will maintain copy of historical data until gaining location accepts and loads vehicle.    If  shipped  data  and/  or  keys  are  not  readily  visible,  identify  location  with  a prominently placed label. 2.42.4.

Operators of these vehicles are responsible for replacing defective wire-ropes/cables.  Operators will notify and provide recertification paperwork to FM&A as soon as possible after making the replacement.  (T-0).  They also make  adjustments  to  mechanisms  affecting  operating  characteristics  of  the  unit  (for example, crane and dozer clutches and brakes, power control units, shoes, deflectors, etc.).  Inspect and grease vehicles as required by the TO or manual, and report any problems to vehicle management.  (T-0). 3.19.1.9.  Fire truck operators maintain and replace accessory firefighting equipment such as  power  saws,  air  breathing  apparatus,  smoke  extractors,  ladders,  portable  fire extinguishers, pike poles, prying or cutting tools, nonattached hoses, rescue and first-aid equipment and portable lights or lighting systems even if equipment is shipped as part of the vehicle purchase. 3.19.1.10.  Medical personnel maintain and replace non-vehicular medical equipment such as life sustaining or support equipment, oxygen systems, rescue, and first-aid equipment, even if they are shipped as part of the vehicle purchase. AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 83 3.19.1.11.  Organizations assigned tracked vehicles procure and replace track shoes. 3.19.1.12.  Base  communications  or  contract  maintenance  (arranged  for  by  the  using organization)  repairs  two-way  mission  radio  and  intercom  systems,  even  if  these  are shipped as part of the vehicle purchase. 3.19.1.13.  Maintenance of locally procured vehicle-mounted equipment and attachments.  Organizations  must  coordinate  with  the  VFM/VMS  before  vehicle-mounted  equipment and attachments are acquired.  Associated O&M costs are paid by the owning organization.  This topic will be briefed at VCO/VCNCO meetings. 3.19.1.14.  Include maintenance and parts publications in the request to locally purchase equipment  to  be  supported  by  Vehicle  Management.    Send  the  publications  to  Vehicle Management after the equipment is received.  The VFM/VMS do not assume management responsibility for locally purchased equipment without the necessary technical data if, in their  opinion,  inspection,  servicing,  adjustment  or  repair  work  cannot  be  performed properly. 3.19.1.15.  Buying  jacks,  jack  handles,  lug  wrenches,  wax,  highway  warning  kits,  spare tires,  wheels,  tire  chains,  fire  extinguishers,  wheel  chocks,  placards,  shoring,  dunnage, lubricants, lubrication equipment, starting fluid, windshield washer fluid, special tools, and accessories to meet operating requirements. Note:  When equipment operators are responsible for lubricating equipment before and during use, Vehicle Management will advise operators regarding the lubricant to be used, tools needed and frequency of lubrication.  The using organization procures required tools and lubricants, and is responsible for replacing equipment and special tools lost, worn or damaged beyond economical repair.  3.19.1.16.  Security  Forces  funds  for  various  vehicle  add-on  equipment  needed  for operational security needs (refer to paragraph 3.34).  This includes funding speedometer calibration  cost  w/  local  vendors  on  organizational  vehicles.    Security  Forces  will coordinate with Vehicle Management before any service is performed on vehicles.  (T-1). 3.19.1.17.  AF  Organizations  operating  vehicles  on  public  roads  within  the  European Command  (EUCOM)  area  of  responsibility  are  responsible  to  review  and  ensure  strict compliance  with  the  requirements  of  USAFEI  23-104  when  carrying/transporting hazardous goods and/or waste.  (T-2). 3.19.2.  Vehicle Discrepancies and Maintenance Turn-In. 3.19.2.1.  Vehicle operators record all discrepancies as they perform inspections, or when discovered  in  the  appropriate  section  of  the  applicable  Operator's  Inspection  Guide  and Trouble Report.  All  non-safety  related discrepancies/items  will  be reported to  Vehicle Management within one normal duty day. 3.19.2.2.  When  operators  discover  discrepancies  that  can  adversely  affect  the  safety  of personnel or the operation of vehicles/equipment (as referenced in paragraphs 3.19.2.2.1 thru  3.19.2.2.7) the operator will discontinue use, record discrepancy on the appropriate Operator‘s  Inspection  Guide  and  Trouble  Report  and  report  the  discrepancy  to  Vehicle Management  as  soon  as  possible.  (T-1).    If  the  discrepancy  occurs  outside  Vehicle Management duty hours, discontinue vehicle use, record discrepancy and notify Vehicle 84 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 Management  the  next  duty  day.    (T-1).    Discrepancies  for  the  following  items  are considered "Safety related” and reported to Vehicle Management immediately: 3.19.2.2.1.  Tires or brakes. 3.19.2.2.2.  Steering mechanisms. 3.19.2.2.3.  Operating  levers  controlling  power  transmission,  hoisting,  dumping  and tripping  devices.

Note:  The using organization funds for and buys these items and associated hardware such as nuts and bolts. 3.19.4.2.  Maintain installed equipment related to the normal CE function, such as stoves, refrigerators,  heaters,  air-conditioners,  sanitary  facilities,  similar  CE  items  mounted  in government-owned trailers (including house trailers) and truck cargo compartments. 3.19.4.3.  Fund for and maintain real and non-real property equipment assigned on the CES Equipment Authorization Inventory Data (EAID) and tenant equipment assigned to CES AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 85 according  to  AFI  25-201  agreements.    This  includes  mobile  (wheeled  or  skid-mounted) engine-driven  utility-type  generator  sets,  pumps,  air  compressors,  liquid  gas  generators, house  and  office  trailers,  and  so  forth,  to  which  USAF/AFEMS  vehicle  registration numbers have not been assigned. 3.19.4.4.  Store and inspect seasonal equipment not in possession of Vehicle Management every month during off-season months, using the applicable Operator’s Inspection Guide and  Trouble  Report.    Operationally  check  motorized  equipment  fully  during  this inspection. Section 3C—Organization  3.20.  Organization of Vehicle Management.  Organize the Vehicle Management activity IAW AFI 38-101, Air Force Organization.  Follow the guidance in AFI 38-101 if directed to contract Vehicle  Management  (See  Figure  3.2  for  a  typical  shop  organization  chart).    All  Vehicle Management functions are consolidated under the VFM/VMS.  AF/A4LR is the approval authority for requests to deviate from consolidation. Exception:  Mobile units with organic maintenance capability, having separate Vehicle Management facilities, sufficient manpower and an organizational structure, usually including FM&A and Materiel Control, maintain their own equipment when in garrison.  These units may be consolidated under the installation VFM/VMS; however, they do not require AF/A4LR approval to operate independently. 3.21.  Maintenance Work Centers.  Establish work centers as focal points for the labor, parts and tools needed to do the job.   Determine the number of work centers by the type and quantity of vehicles  to  be  serviced  and  the  location  of  shop  buildings.    The  work  center  supervisor  is responsible for all work done in the work center. 3.22.  Administration Section.  If applicable, the administration section performs administrative functions as directed by the VFM/VMS. 3.23.  CSC.  CSC is the POC between the vehicle user and Vehicle Management.  CSC technicians debrief  vehicle  operators  and  perform  incoming  inspections  on  vehicles  for  determining maintenance requirements.  The VFM/VMS determines (in an OI) the extent of completed work to be inspected, what types of repairs and services are inspected, and by whom.  The skill level of personnel, the vehicle complexity and critical mission support are determining factors.  Generally, all completed PM&I, steering and brake repairs receive an outgoing inspection.  The technician in charge of this section is well experienced in all aspects of Vehicle Management.  In this section, consideration  of  the  needs  of  the  using  organization  is  given  to  avoid  unnecessary  vehicle downtime  and  increase  MC  time  by  providing  service  within  the  shortest  turn-around  time possible.    Quality  and  service  is  the  byword  of  this  section;  it  must  be  readily  accessible  and recognizable  to  the  customer.    VFM/VMS  ensures  this  section  provides  timely  service.    When necessary,  personnel  from  other  sections  are  used  during  peak  workload  periods.    Specific responsibilities of CSC include the following: 3.23.1.  Provide fast and dependable service to the user. 3.23.2.  Debrief vehicle operators. 86 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 3.23.3.  Verify  malfunctions  and  perform  a  complete  inspection  using  diagnostic  test equipment when required.  Use AF Form 4355 to document vehicle’s condition. 3.23.4.  Determine if the malfunction is a result of suspected accident or abuse, and if so, take proper  action;  “Waiver”  only  non-essential  work.    Using  the  appropriate  series  Operator‘s Inspection Guide and Trouble Report as a permanent waiver card is optional at the discretion of  the  VFM/VMS.    Alternatives  for  tracking  waivered  items  will  be  established  using  a computer listing, card file index, etc. (at the discretion of the VFM/VMS). 3.23.5.  Delay  work  when  necessary,  only  when  safety  defects  are  not  involved  and  when deficiencies  will  not  cause  further  damage  to  or  problems  with  the  vehicle.    Complete delayed/deferred work as soon as is practical, i.e., parts are on hand and vehicle is in the shop. 3.23.6.  Perform  minor  maintenance  as  required.    Portable  test  equipment  and  a  small working/bench stock enhance the CSC operation.  The CSC and outlying work centers use AF Form 1827, Minor Maintenance Work Order, for repairs that take no more than two total labor hours time for all jobs required and requires only the installation of low-cost stock parts.  Do not use the AF Form 1827 for PM&I, Special inspections, TCTOs, SBs and OTIs.  The AF Form  1827  will  not  be  used  when  the  total  repair  time  (including  awaiting  maintenance, awaiting parts and actual labor) exceeds two hours.  A normal work order will be processed to capture NMC downtime exceeding the two-hour limit.  The AF Form 1827 will not be used to record multiple jobs on the same vehicle during the same repair period.  Each line on the AF Form 1827 is interpreted as a separate work order in OLVIMS. 3.23.7.  Vehicle and Equipment Work Order and Vehicle Processing (Main Shop).  When the vehicle operator reports to the CSC/shop with the vehicle inspection guide, the operator stays with  the  vehicle  until  the  inspection  and  debriefing  are  complete.    Operators  will  perform required operator care (refer to paragraph 3.19), to include interior and exterior cleanliness, before  turning  the  vehicle  over  to  the  CSC.    (T-1).    Processing  steps  essentially  follow  the pattern below (the VFM/VMS may adjust procedures for vehicle in processing as necessary to meet local conditions and mission): 3.23.7.1.  Using the Operator’s Inspection Guide and Trouble Report form along with the AF  Form  4355,  the  inspector  makes  a  complete  inspection  to  verify  the  vehicle's malfunctions, validate waived items and to ensure repairs that effect safe vehicle operation are addressed.  CSC personnel use the proper diagnostic and test equipment to identify and isolate the malfunctions when required. 3.23.7.2.  The CSC determines if there are any delayed/deferred or scheduled inspections due; installs delayed parts that have been received, workload permitting. 3.23.7.3.  The CSC will initiate an AF Form 1823/-1 if the vehicle requires any one of the following: 3.23.7.3.1.  PM&I, Special Inspections, TCTO, SB or OTI are required/due. 3.23.7.3.2.  Repair action takes two or more hours to complete. 3.23.7.3.3.  Vehicle/vehicular  equipment  NMC  downtime  has  been  longer  than  two hours (refer to paragraph 3.35.) 3.23.7.3.4.  If required part used is other than low-cost bench/working stock. AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 87 3.23.7.4.  The  CSC  enters  the  actual/suspected  malfunctions  on  the  AF  Form  4355,  to include all tests that have been performed, and the direct labor-hours spent to perform the inspections  and  tests,  and  forward  (and  AF  Form  1823/-1  if  processed  in  the  CSC)  to FM&A.  (T-1). 3.23.7.5.  The  "look  phase"  of  PM&I,  lubrications  and  oil  filter  changes  may  best  be performed by the CSC section.  Enter labor-hours for this work on the AF Form 1823/-1. 3.23.7.6.  The VFM/VMS determines which outgoing quality inspections will be done. 3.23.7.7.  Perform road tests as needed.  Ensure road test locations are approved in advance through SFS and wing safety. Figure 3.2.  Sample Vehicle Management Organization Chart 3.24.  Tire Repair Section: 3.24.1.  Repair all vehicle tires.  3.24.2.  Maintain all assigned tire repair and servicing equipment in a safe operating condition. 3.24.3.  Ensure strict compliance with safety standards. 3.24.4.  Personnel assigned to the Tire Shop will be thoroughly trained in all aspects of tire inspection  and  repair  procedures.    (T-1).    Document  training  certification  on  AF  Form  55, Employee Safety and Health Record, for civilian employees and training records for military personnel.  (T-1).  TO 36-1-191 will be readily available, electronically or hard-copy, within the  vehicle  maintenance/service  facility.    (T-1).    Personnel  must  be  familiar  with  the instructions outlined in these publications.  (T-1).  Employees must exercise extreme caution when working with split-rim wheels.  Refer to AFI 91-203 for additional guidance.  (T-1). 3.24.5.  The vehicle operator has primary responsibility for removing and installing mounted tires;  however,  Vehicle  Management  personnel  remove  and  install  mounted  tires  once  the 88 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 vehicle has been accepted into the shop, unless it has been previously  agreed upon that the operator will provide assistance. 3.25.  Battery Shop. 3.25.1.  Maintain an adequate stock of batteries to give quick service. 3.25.2.  Test, fill and charge all batteries. 3.25.3.  Keep all batteries under lock and key to prevent theft. 3.25.4.  Keep all assigned equipment, such as battery chargers, tools and safety equipment in good operating condition.  Comply with all applicable safety standards. 3.25.5.  Refer to AFI 91-203 for additional guidance . 3.26.  Shop Facilities: 3.26.1.  The AF has a large investment in Vehicle Management shops because the majority of intermediate maintenance is done in these fixed facilities.  Productivity is increased by using new methods and procedures to get the most out of personnel, tools and space.  For example, to have good workflow, locate FM&A and the CSC in places that are easy for customers to reach.  Ideally, related work centers are located close together. 3.26.2.  Use AFI 32-1024, Standard Facility Requirements, as a guide to compute total space needs to  provide adequate facilities, to  identify deficiencies in  the shop, and as the basis to initiate corrective action. 3.26.3.  Send requests for real property construction, modification or changes to the CES on AF Form 332, Base Civil Engineer Work Request. 3.26.4.  Send requests for maintenance or repair of real property facilities to the CES. 3.26.5.  Activities that do not have standard AF shops develop a plan to use the shop areas to gain  the  most  efficiency  and  productivity.    The  VFM/VMS  consider  the  following  in  their plans: 3.26.5.1.  Type, size and number of vehicles to be worked on. 3.26.5.2.  Type of work and service to be done. 3.26.5.3.  Time needed to do a job. 3.26.5.4.  Space required for each type of repair. 3.26.5.5.  Locations of water, air, electrical outlets and exhaust fume ventilators. 3.26.5.6.  Location of shop tools, such as hydraulic floor jacks, transmission jacks, portable lubrication equipment, etc. 3.26.5.7.  Locations of COPARS, FM&A, CSC and Materiel Control are as close to each other as possible.  Be sure that the CSC section is easy for vehicle users to find. 3.26.5.8.  Size of the shop parking area. 3.26.5.9.  Location of vehicle publications. 3.27.  VM  Training  Leader.  The  Vehicle  Management  Training  Leader  develops  and administers a training program as outlined in Chapter 6 and AFI 36-2201. AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 89 3.28.  FM&A.  FM&A is the focal point for determining repairs and authorizing the expenditure of manpower and material through the work centers.  It is also the focal point for the movement of vehicles and equipment to and from the work centers and for commercial contract repair activities.  FM&A will be accessible and recognizable to its customers. 3.28.1.  FM&A ensures the efficient and economical operation of the base vehicle fleet. 3.28.2.  FM&A oversees the VCP, Fleet Analysis and vehicle management/maintenance data integrity. 3.28.3.  FM&A personnel will use LIMS-EV Vehicle View or CRIS Tool for hand receipts, the VED for data integrity and the CRIS Tool for requesting IL-S transactions.  (T-1). 3.29.  Work Center Supervisors.  Work center supervisors are responsible for: 3.29.1.  Coordinating  with  FM&A  to  ensure  priorities  are  met  and  maintenance  tasks  are completed on time. 3.29.2.  Assigning work to personnel commensurate with their skills. 3.29.3.  Ensuring that proper tools and equipment are readily available and serviceable, and that subordinate personnel are properly trained in their use.  The supervisor reports shortages and deficient equipment to the VFM/VMS. 3.29.4.  Ensuring technicians comply with safety procedures and technical data. Note:  Complying with technical data does not mean an open book reference for each repair task.  It does require the technician to be familiar with the procedures for each job.  Complex repair tasks, performance specifications, torque ratings, special tolerance adjustments and so forth, do require reference to technical data, and, in some cases, repeated reference at the job location.  Technical data for vehicles or vehicular equipment serviced must be current.  Any of the following data sources, in printed or digital form, are acceptable: TOs; commercial manuals, printed material, microfilm or software provided by or procured from the asset manufacturer; commercially procured after-market parts and repair manuals, such as Chilton® Manuals; or digitized technical data such as Mitchell1® or its equivalent.  3.29.5.  Inspecting  incoming  vehicles  and  equipment  not  processed  through  CSC.    The supervisor coordinates with FM&A if additional repairs not listed on the AF Form 1823/-1 are required and revises the Estimated Time In-Commission (ETIC) as needed. 3.29.6.  Inspecting  repaired  vehicles  and  equipment  to  ensure  all  vehicles  are  in  a  safe serviceable condition. 3.29.7.  Briefing newly assigned personnel. 3.29.8.  Assigning personnel to duty positions to ensure full use and progression opportunities. 3.29.9.  Determining the most efficient and economical means of returning vehicles to service.  The supervisor will carefully consider the repair or replacement of individual assemblies or subassemblies and components to make effective use of resources.  In addition, adhere to any safety and serviceability standards, and avoid “over-maintaining” the vehicle. 3.29.10.  Informing FM&A of the requirement for more work so that maximum productivity may be obtained from assigned personnel. 90 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 3.29.11.  Checking with Materiel Control on parts requirements and availability. 3.29.12.  Accounting for labor hours for work center. 3.29.13.  Determining  training  needs,  sending  training  requirements  to  the  VFM/VMS  and assisting in OJT. 3.29.14.  Ensuring parts received for vehicles during the work phase are properly protected and not improperly stored on the vehicle’s seat or other soft trim. 3.29.15.  Ensuring vehicles in Non-Mission Capable Supply (NMCS) status are preserved at storage  level  “C”  as  prescribed  in  TO  36-1-191,  Chapter  8,  Storage  and  Shipment,  unless stored inside, or if the vehicle is expected to be in NMCS status for less the 30 days. 3.29.16.  Assisting  FM&A  by  providing  accurate  data/information  in  order  to  properly complete and transmit DRs. Section 3D—Principles  3.30.  Cannibalization  Rules.  The  VFM/VMS  use  cannibalization  primarily  to  meet  mission goals.  Cannibalization action is documented according to Chapter 7 and proper cost accounting will be done. 3.30.1.  441 VSCOS or Robins AFB SE&V may direct the repair of critical vehicles pending disposition.    Cannibalization  of  the  major  components  or  assemblies  of  critical  vehicles pending disposition instructions must be approved by 441 VSCOS.  (T-1). 3.30.2.  The AFEMS (C001) provides an on-line query, with the exception management code ID (IIEM), to determine the vehicle criticality.  A critical vehicle is identified by the critical code “C”. 3.30.3.  The Vehicle Management Index File (VMIF) also identifies vehicles as critical or non-critical. 3.31.  Contract Operated Vehicle Management Activities.  All PWSs for vehicle management will be performance-based.  (T-0).  VFMs at all levels will use this AFI (citing specific chapters and/or paragraphs) as the basis for developing a PWS.  (T-0).  Also, Chapter 9 will be reviewed for additional information concerning contract activities. 3.31.1.  All PWSs for contractor operated vehicle management activities will be coordinated with 441 VSCOS.  (T-1). 3.32.  Maintenance  Priorities.  Each Vehicle Management activity applies priorities to support the mission and customer needs as follows: 3.32.1.  Routine  Priority:    Vehicle  Management  normally  assigns  "Routine"  priority  to  all vehicles,  regardless  of  type  or  use.    However,  vehicles  requiring  scheduled  maintenance actions  (e.g.,  PMI,  TCTO,  Special  Inspections  or  OTI)  will  receive  preferential  action  over routine non-scheduled maintenance actions. 3.32.2.  Red (Urgent) Priority:  Vehicle Management assigns “Red” priority when one or more of the following conditions apply: AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 91 3.32.2.1.  A  unit  is  below  the  established  MEL  for  a  particular  vehicle/equipment  type; further loss of vehicles or equipment will degrade mission support and other base assets cannot fulfill the need of a particular vehicle. 3.32.2.2.  A special project requires a certain type of vehicle in service. 3.32.2.3.  Severe weather or other natural circumstances create a need for certain types of vehicles. 3.32.3.  Installed emergency warning lights, military radios  or other such accessories do not automatically cause a vehicle to  be a higher priority.   Like and possibly  dissimilar vehicles without  such  accessories  are  generally  sufficient  to  perform  the  mission  until  the  equipped vehicle is returned to service. 3.32.4.  When a replacement vehicle is temporarily given to a user, the prime vehicle receives a routine maintenance priority. 3.32.5.  Direct Mission Support Vehicles/Equipment:  Vehicles and equipment which are used to support combat, tactical or airfield operations.  MELs for these vehicles will be developed and verified each year between using organization requirements and the vehicle management activity.  (T-1).  The MEL shows the number of vehicles or vehicular equipment, by authorized type and any substitutes, needed in mission capable status to complete the user's mission. 3.32.5.1.  The  VFM/VMS  review  the  vehicle  MEL  for  maintenance  priorities  and  for backfilling primary vehicles when vehicles are in Vehicle Management.  This list serves as the vehicle maintenance priority repair list which the VFM/VMS can use as a guide for day to day fleet management. 3.32.5.2.  Vehicle Management ensures that minimum essential vehicle levels and mission needs are met.  This may require withdrawing vehicles from organizations currently above their MEL or with lower priorities.  Within Vehicle Management, it may be necessary to consolidate  the  work  force,  work  overtime,  cannibalize  parts,  delay  work  or  make temporary repairs to return priority vehicles to service. 3.33.  Vehicle Modification Policy.  Vehicle modifications are any  alterations to  a vehicle that will change the original configuration or impact the primary structure, hydraulic power system, load-bearing capacity, steering, braking capability, positive control features, lifting, power train or restraint systems of a vehicle. 3.33.1.  Modification  request  should  only  be  forwarded  when  the  customer  needs  cannot otherwise be met; either through vehicle rotation or leasing. Note:  Secondary restraint systems (airbags) will not be disabled unless approved by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA).  (T-0).  Vehicle Management, Wing and MAJCOM Safety will validate requests for such action prior to submission to the NHTSA.  (T-0). 3.33.2.  All  requests  for  modifications  will  be  submitted  to  FM&A  and  routed  through  441 VSCOS  for  appropriate  IPT.    (T-1)    The  IPT  ensures  the  configuration  changes  to  special mounted  equipment  are  documented  in  appropriate  technical  data  and  that  necessary adjustments are made to logistics support plans. 92 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 3.33.2.1.  Permanent  local  modifications  to  special  mounted  equipment  are  usually  not approved unless required to correct isolated problems. 3.33.3.  All  modification  correspondence/approvals  will  be  maintained  in  the  permanent portion of the vehicle historical record. 3.33.4.  Additional guidance is provided in AFI 91-103 for nuclear certified vehicles. Note:  Unapproved modifications to nuclear certified vehicles will probably result in the vehicle being classified as “restricted use”. 3.34.  Vehicle  “Add-On”  Equipment  Policy.  Adding  manufactures’  optional  equipment  or after-market  optional  part/accessory  to  meet  certain  operational  needs  is  not  considered  a modification  if  the  vehicle  is  still  used  for  its  original  purpose  and  can  be  returned  to  original condition within a reasonable amount of time (i.e., 24 hours) with little or no expense. 3.34.1.  Generally, an add-on will not change the original configuration, or impact the primary structure, hydraulic power system, load-bearing capacity, steering, braking capability, positive control features, steering, lifting, power train or load carrying/restraint systems of a vehicle.  Examples  of  vehicle  add-on  equipment  include  (but  is  not  limited  to):  light  bar/emergency lights, siren, two-way radio, pintle hook and trailer-hitch assemblies. 3.34.2.  Requesting  organizations  must  submit  written  add-on  equipment  justification  to Vehicle Management.  Requests must address the extent of the proposed work, impact if denied and availability of funds for contracting the equipment installation. 3.34.2.1.  Organizational  justification  request  for  add-on  equipment  to  government controlled rented or leased assets will also be sent to Vehicle Management.  If approved, FM&A will submit to leasing agency (i.e., GSA) to obtain approval for installation of add-on equipment to vehicle.  (T-0).  Leasing agency's concurrence or non-concurrence will be maintained in the requesting organization‘s vehicle control records in FM&A.  (T-1). 3.34.3.  Add-on equipment will not be installed prior to VFM/VMS approval.  (T-1). 3.34.3.1.  If  approved,  when  workload  and  resources  permit,  Vehicle  Management  may elect to install these items. 3.34.4.  Vehicles will be placed back into original configuration if vehicle is rotated/shipped, and at using unit’s cost. 3.34.5.  Regardless  of  maintenance  responsibilities,  all  add-on  equipment  will  be  assigned vehicle  equivalents  and  captured  in  OLVIMS  using  the  AE  screen  and  loaded  via  the  AV screen for government owned assets.  (T-1).  Vehicle Fleet Managers will use the AF Vehicle Equivalent List located at https://www.vemso.hq.af.mil/vehicleEquivalents/vehequiv.html to  assign  equivalents  and  consider  the  following  guidance  when  deciding  whether  to  claim additional equivalents for locally added or factory-installed optional equipment.  (T-1). 3.34.5.1.  Items  are  only  claimed  once,  regardless  of  how  many  are  on  the  vehicle.  Examples are pintle hooks on bobtails, roof mounted air conditioning units on buses, etc. 3.34.5.2.  Some examples of items not to count as add-on equipment are standard (original equipment)  shelving,  bins,  flashing  lights,  additional  wiring  on  ambulances,  standard plows and blades on snow plows and graders, standard AM/FM radios, anti-lock brakes, air bags, mud flaps and electronic fuel injection systems. AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 93 3.34.6.  Any requests for add-ons to nuclear certified vehicles will be routed to the Base Safety Office for approval.  (T-1).  For informational purposes, all add-on requests will be courtesy copied to 441 VSCOS. (T-1).  For additional guidance on modifications of nuclear certified vehicles reference AFI 91-103 and AFI 91-107. 3.34.7.  File approved authorization to install add-on equipment in the permanent portion of the vehicle record jacket or scanned copy in equivalent electronic file. 3.34.8.  AIM2™  system  components  are  considered  add-on  equipment.    However,  written request/justification for use and VFM/VMS approval for installation is not required, to include installation on nuclear certified vehicles.  FM&A will maintain a record of AIM2™ component installation  and  removal  in  the  permanent  portion  of  the  vehicle’s  record  jacket,  and  VM Neighborhood  listing.  (T-1).    An  additional  VE  of  “0.1”will  be  added  to  the  vehicle  in OLVIMS. 3.34.8.1.  AIM2™ components will be installed on applicable GSA leased vehicles if the system  is  available.  (T-1).    The  AF  has  received  blanket  approval  from  GSA  allowing AIM2™  installation/use.    The  FM&A  requirement  to  obtain  approval  from  GSA  for installation is not required. 3.35.  NMC Hours.  NMC hours start on the date and time entered on the Operator’s Inspection Guide and Trouble Report (the date/time that the discrepancy is reported to Vehicle Management) or when a request for mobile maintenance (roadside) support is received. 3.35.1.  When initiating a work order, the CSC will adjust the NMC start time to account for actual downtime which began with any mobile maintenance or wrecker support request.  As needed, adjustments will be coordinated with FM&A and/or Vehicle Operations Dispatch to confirm the operator’s original request for repair/wrecker assistance. 3.35.2.  Vehicles awaiting accident, abuse and repair decisions/repairs will draw downtime. 3.35.3.  Upon VFM/VMS request, FM&A provides an NMC report reflecting hours controlled by Vehicle Management (in-house) and repair hours not controlled by Vehicle Management (contract, warranty, etc.). 3.35.4.  NMC time ends after completion and verification of all maintenance actions. 3.35.5.  NMC hours reporting exclusions: 3.35.5.1.  Exclude reporting NMC hours for Awaiting Disposition vehicles in status code D,  E,  I,  or  N  and  ensure  they  are  opened  as  “4000”  work  orders.    Repairs  of  seasonal equipment  during  the  off-season  such  as  snow  removal,  deicing  equipment  and lawnmowers will also be opened as “4000” work orders and will not report NMC hours.  Refer to paragraph 4.28 for definition of status codes mentioned above. 3.35.5.2.  Exclude reporting NMC hours for vehicles owned or under the control of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL).  These vehicles are placed in fleets around the AF to collect  O&M  data  in  an  effort  to  develop  and  perfect  new  technologies  for  AF  use.  Significant NMC hours are expected during these tests. 3.35.6.  NMCS vehicles are not normally repaired until all the parts have been received, unless approved by the VFM/VMS.  For example, an engine received for a crash fire fighting vehicle may be installed even though a required converter has not been delivered.  After the engine is 94 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 installed, the status of the vehicle reverts to NMCS.  The supply priority for the converter is not downgraded. Note:  Vehicles on NMCS status will be prime candidates for corrosion control repairs.  Remove the vehicle from NMCS status in OLVIMS only until the corrosion repairs are completed, then return the vehicle to NMCS status until the parts are received.  3.35.7.  Use MC data to support manning, shop equipment, vehicle replacement criteria, new vehicle buy budgets and reliability and deployment programs. 3.36.  Reclamation Procedures: 3.36.1.  Accomplish  reclamation  to  the extent necessary before or  after processing to  DLA-DS.    FM&A  coordinates  with  using  organizations  for  removal  of  organizational  equipment prior  to  transferring  a  vehicle  to  DLA-DS.    Document  removed  parts  on  AFTO  Form  91.  Authority  is  granted  to  retain  vehicles  for  parts  reclamation  or  training  purposes  after instructions  have  been  received  to  transfer  an  asset  to  DLA-DS  for  disposition  within  the following guidelines: 3.36.1.1.  No more than two like vehicles (same management code, make, model, and year) shall be retained for retention at the same time. 3.36.1.2.  Vehicles  will  not  be  retained  longer  than  90  days  after  receipt  of  disposal instructions.  (T-1).  If special circumstances exist which warrant longer retention, request a waiver of the 90-day retention limit from 441 VSCOS.  (T-1). 3.36.1.3.  Vehicles  retained  for  parts  reclamation  will  be  properly  identified  and  stored separately from other vehicles in the vehicle maintenance compound.  (T-1).  Use the TRT (Transaction Request Tool) to notify 441 VSCOS to place vehicles retained for reclamation in status code "E", ASC code 048??EG (Special Retention). 3.36.1.4.  Recover  and  recycle  refrigerant  from  air  conditioning  systems  categorized  as ozone  depleting  substance  (ODS).    (T-0).    Verify  refrigerant  has  been  evacuated  and document such in accordance with local DLA-DS procedures. 3.36.1.5.  Remove any compressed gas cylinders/bottles, e.g., portable fire extinguishers or fire suppression system agent tanks.   (T-1).  Return portable fire extinguishers to the using unit if an “add-on”.  Contact local Occupational Safety Office for proper disposal procedures for others. 3.36.1.6.  Cancel bench stock/special levels and remove technical manuals from file when there is no other like vehicles assigned. 3.36.2.  Withdraw  vehicles  from  DLA-DS  for  special  projects  or  an  authorized  need  upon written  441  VSCOS  approval.    (T-1).    VFM/VMS  provide  technical  assistance  in  selecting vehicles to be withdrawn.  Procedures for withdrawing vehicles from DLA-DS are in AFI 23-101. 3.36.3.  VFM/VMS will monitor the repair and turn-in of vehicle parts to ensure serviceable parts with a foreseeable need are not turned in for disposal.  To reduce the potential for fraud, waste and abuse, inventory and store serviceable, non-credit turn-in parts for which there is a projected need, as work order residue. 3.37.  DELETED. AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 95 3.38.  Shop Publications.  Necessary technical literature, including TOs and service manuals will be available at all times.

When applicable, monitor contract repair funds and advise the VFM/VMS and Cost Center Manager as appropriate.  4.6.  Ensure Economical Repair of All Vehicles. 4.6.1.  Scheduling Maintenance.  FM&A exercises flexibility in scheduling work into the shop.  Parts availability, work center manning and the needs of the customer are considered when FM&A plans, schedules and adjusts the shop workload.  However, all scheduled maintenance must be initiated before or when due.  (T-1). 4.6.1.1.  Schedule vehicles for needed inspections, services and repairs.  An appointment system is recommended. 4.6.1.2.  Inform  the  work  center  supervisor  of  scheduled  work,  TCTOs,  SBs,  OTIs, Manufacturer Recalls, completed defers and other needs. 4.6.2.  Ensure work is authorized before it is started and notify the VFM/VMS of any estimated repair costs that exceed the one-time repair limit for the vehicle. 4.6.3.  Assign Work Priority.  Refer to paragraph 3.32.  Notify the VFM/VMS when mission essential vehicles fall below MEL.  PCN SB004-008 can be used to aid in this requirement. 4.6.4.  Perform Workload Control Board duties. 4.6.4.1.  Initiate and route AF Form 1823/-1 to the work centers. 4.6.4.2.  Monitor workload status and control work flow through the work centers. 4.6.4.3.  Consider maintenance in progress, backlog maintenance and work awaiting shop when an ETIC is  requested.  The  FM&A Workload Controller  and the applicable work center supervisors jointly determine the ETIC to be assigned. 4.6.4.4.  Update the workload control board with vehicle and personnel status as required by the VFM/VMS. 4.6.5.  Delay work when needed.  Check the delayed workload and schedule vehicles for work when the shop capability and needs of the customer permit. 4.6.6.  Recommend,  in  coordination  with  the  work  center  supervisor,  contract  repair  action when repair work or the workload becomes too excessive.  Initiate contract documents after approval is received from the VFM/VMS.  See paragraph 4.5.2. 4.6.7.  Ensure that vehicle and parts warranties are utilized. 4.6.8.  Monitor cannibalization. 4.6.9.  Assist work centers in preparing LTI forms.. 102 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 4.6.10.  Ensure  repairs  for  TCTOs,  SBs,  OTIs  and  Manufacturer  Recalls  are  scheduled, tracked, accomplished and recorded. 4.6.11.  Establish  and  control  Vehicle  Management  labor  hour  reporting  in  OLVIMS  as prescribed by AFCSM 24-1. 4.6.12.  Process OLVIMS Maintenance data, as prescribed by AFCSM 24-1, while ensuring 100  percent  OLVIMS  and  vehicle  data  accuracy  to  include:  Vehicle  Identification  Number (VIN), make, model, serial number, fuel code, fuel consumption and mileage/hour reading. 4.6.13.  Closely monitor repairs on vehicles displaying replacement codes A through J . Note:  Replacement codes are used as a maintenance management economical tool only.  Perform only minimum essential repairs on these vehicles to keep them in service until replacements are received. 4.7.  Accident  and  Abuse  Work  Order  Processing.  Refer  to  paragraph  1.13.  for  program policy.  The following will take place when the shop receives a vehicle with actual or suspected accident or abuse damage: 4.7.1.  CSC personnel  will notify the VFM/VMS and initiate the appropriate “estimate” AF Form 1823/-1.  (T-1).  The “estimate” work order will be used to estimate accident/abuse repair cost only.  (T-1). Note:  When computing estimated cost for repairing accident damage, indirect cost is included only to determine one-time repair limitations. 4.7.2.  Actual  repairs  will  be  documented  using  an  “Accident  or  Abuse  Actual”  AF  Form 1823/-1, and will not be initiated until the organization of responsibility “releases” the vehicle for repairs.  (T-1).  Only accident or abuse related repairs will be documented on the “actual” work order.  (T-1).  Any other unscheduled repairs or scheduled services will be completed on an unscheduled or scheduled maintenance work order to follow.  (T-1). 4.7.3.  FM&A will prepare an AF Form 20, Repair Cost and Reparable Value Statement, when required by local policy or requested by the Surveying Officer.  (T-1). 4.8.  Develop Depot Maintenance Plan. 4.8.1.  FM&A is responsible for the effective use of the depot program. 4.8.2.  DELETED. 4.8.3.  Vehicles  at  depot  will  draw  downtime.    Retain  vehicle  record  in  master  file  while vehicle is undergoing depot rebuild so that vehicle downtime is accurately documented. 4.8.4.  Downtime  begins  when  vehicle  is  removed  from  service  and  shipping  LTI  is accomplished (a “4000”  work order will remain  “open”).  Downtime ends after the vehicle returns from depot, acceptance LTI is accomplished and the vehicle is available for use. Note:  Vehicle will not draw downtime if vehicle is not being returned to the shipping base.  4.8.5.  Capture  depot  rebuild  cost.    Process  a  “JZ”  transaction  to  capture  the  cost  of  depot rebuild when the vehicle returns from depot (“JZ” transaction is generated by the “JZ” screen” that may be seen on the PCN SB004-005, edit list.  “JZ” is used to charge the contract cost and establish contract warranty information).  The cost will include transportation and actual depot AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 103 repair costs.  (T-1).  “JZ” transactions are limited to $99,999 per month/quarter.  If depot and shipping  costs  exceed  $80,000,  split  the  cost  evenly  and  capture  the  remaining  cost  the following two quarters.  Depot cost is provided by Robins AFB SE&V to 441 VSCOS , which subsequently forwards the cost data to the base.  Contact servicing DDF for the shipping cost to depot.  Use this same shipping cost for the return cost from depot. 4.8.6.  Ensure  depot  rebuild  date  is  captured  and  properly  loaded  via  the  “AZ”  (years  and months) in OLVIMS to prevent premature movement into replacement codes A-J, reference AFCSM 24-1 (“AZ” transaction used to load/update/delete a vehicle (static data)). Note:  AF license plates must be removed from vehicles prior to departure for depot.  (T-1).  License plate(s) will be stored in the vehicle‘s records jacket (or in FM&A if vehicle records are stored electronically).  (T-1).  If vehicle is being transferred to another location after depot repairs, FM&A will ship the plates to the new location via registered mail.  (Refer to TO 36-1-191).  (T-1). 4.9.  Vehicle  Shipment  to  Depot  Repair.  Local  Traffic  Management  Flight  will  assist  with guidance on funding the transportation costs associated with an RDO as provided in AFI 24-203.  (T-1).  Criteria for these vehicles are contained in TO 36-1-191, Chapter 9.  441 VSCOS will provide shipping instructions for vehicles scheduled for depot repair.  (T-1).  Three vehicle status codes apply to depot  shipments.  Status codes  “B”  and  “G”  (accountability not  retained by  the shipping base) require processing of turn-in documents.  Input of either of these two codes will automatically create shipping documents.  Status code “R” (vehicle programmed for return to the base) requires preparation only of an off-line “DO NOT POST” shipping document.  An “FCI 2C” transaction is required to enter status code “R” into the ILS-S records. 4.10.  Capture/Input  Maintenance  Historical  Data  in  OLVIMS  from  Supported  Outlying Work Centers and GSUs. 4.10.1.  Work  Order  and  Vehicle  Processing  for  Outlying  Work  Centers.    The  operator debriefing  and  incoming  inspections  are  completed  in  the  work  center  and  repair  needs  are validated.  The de-briefer gives the information to initiate the AF Form 1823/-1 to the FM&A Workload Controller and makes sure any scheduled maintenance and delayed requirements are known.    The  work  center  supervisor  (or  a  designated  technician)  accomplishes  final inspections, which will be shown on the AF Form 1823/-1. 4.11.  Prepare  and  Submit  Deficiency,  Warranty  and  Unsatisfactory  Reports.  Submit  and prepare reports using the Joint Deficiency Reporting System (JDRS) in conjunction with TO 00-35D-54-WA-1, USAF Deficiency Reporting and Investigating System, and TO 36-1-191 Chapter 7.  (T-1).  Additionally, curtesy copy all JDRS packages to 441 VSCOS for situational awareness. Note:  JDRS user login is mandatory.  The JDRS website is located at http://www.jdrs.mil/.   4.12.  Develop and Manage MEL and VPRL. 4.12.1.  In  conjunction  with  using  organizations,  vehicle  MELs  are  established  by  vehicle type/Mgt Code, to include any substitutes to reflect the minimum number of vehicles needed in service to complete the user's mission.  MELs will be verified by using organizations and the vehicle management activity annually.  (T-1).Note:  Use Code D pure WRM (integrated or stored) will not be included in MEL formulas.  MEL formulas will be developed utilizing peacetime authorizations only.  (T-1). 104 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 4.12.2.  Using  organizations  will  provide  justification  data  to  support  requested  MEL  to vehicle management.  (T-1). 4.12.3.  FM&A  reviews  request,  analyzes  utilization  data  and  maintenance  history  and provides the VFM/VMS with recommendations.  The VFM/VMS reviews proposed MEL with the  using  organization  VCO/VCNCOs  before  MSG  Commanders  approval  and  final publication of the list.  The MSG Commander is the final authority for an unresolved MELs. Note:  It is not realistic to have 100 percent of any vehicle type in an organization listed as the MEL.  Allowance must be made for scheduled maintenance, normal breakdowns, etc.   4.12.4.  The approved MEL list serves as the vehicle maintenance priority repair list when the vehicle types identified are below the MEL. 4.12.5.  FM&A manages and executes vehicle priority recalls for the base. 4.12.5.1.  Vehicles listed on the VPRL are grouped by unit and vehicle type and consists of vehicles that exceed the MEL required for a unit to accomplish its mission.  This listing will serve as a recall tool to use for short-term vehicle needs. 4.13.  Review and Verify Nuclear Certified Vehicle Certification and Records. 4.13.1.  FM&A will validate, document and ensure the accuracy of nuclear vehicle certification status by completing the following actions.  (T-1).  These actions are sufficient for accountable reporting  and  management  actions  under  AFI63-125,  Nuclear  Certification  Program,  unit-level program binders are not required. Note:  441 VSCOS has centralized the NCE vehicle program, the procedures below satisfy NCE requirements at or below the installation level.  Overall program management and guidance, MNCL updates and associated actions will be routed by Vehicle Management activities through 441 VSCOS.  (T-1). 4.13.1.1.  New  vehicles.    During  initial  inspection  of  new  vehicles,  FM&A  will  verify nuclear certification status by comparing the vehicle data plate, shipping documents, NIIN, make and model information against the MNCL.  (T-1).  If the vehicle is nuclear certified, enter the nuclear certified vehicle identifier “N” into OLVIMS “AZ” screen (refer to Table 4.1).  (T-1). 4.13.1.2.  During  scheduled  PM&I.    Validate  the  data  plate  information  on  Nuclear Certified  vehicles  (to  include  data  plate  legibility)  and  ensure  the  data  matches  vehicle information  contained  on  the  MNCL.    Review  OLVIMS  to  ensure  the  nuclear  certified status of the vehicle is correctly identified.  Reference AFCSM 24-1, section 5.3.11.1. 4.13.1.3.  Additionally,  review  the  permanent  portion  of  the  records  jacket/file  for documentation concerning nuclear certified vehicle modification request, DULL SWORD reporting and subsequent certification actions (e.g., “Restricted Use”). 4.13.1.4.  Document actions on AF form 4354 and maintained in the active portion of the records jacket/file. 4.13.1.5.  Foreign  made  vehicles  that  are  Nuclear  Certified  (IAW  AFI  91-103)  may  not have  "Data  Plates"  affixed  when  delivered  new.    In  this  instance,  and  thereafter  during scheduled PM&I, FM&A will verify nuclear certification status by comparing the available documentation against the MNCL.  (T-1).  Data Plates may be locally manufactured and AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 105 affixed to these vehicles.  Data Plates will reflect: Model Number, NSN, Part# and Vehicle Registration Number. 4.13.2.  Individual vehicles that have been listed on the MNCL by vehicle registration number as “not authorized" for use during nuclear operations by the AFSC will have the “N” designator removed from the “NUC IND” field on the OLVIMS “AZ” screen for that registration number.  (T-1).  If the AFSC removes the vehicle‘s “not authorized” status from the MNCL, then the “N” designator will be reapplied in OLVIMS at that time.  (T-1). 4.13.2.1.  The use of the “NUC IND” field is for maintenance reference/decision purposes only by Vehicle Management personnel.  IAW AFI 63-125 the “sole authority” for NCE status is the MNCL. 4.13.3.  All  DULL  SWORD  reported  vehicles  will  also  be  documented  through  JDRS  for Deficiency, Warranty and Unsatisfactory reports as noted in section 4.11.  (T-1).  Additionally, courtesy copy all DULL SWORD packages to 441 VSCOS for situational awareness. 4.13.4.  FM&A  will  notify  the  441  VSCOS  NCE  Program  Managers  of  vehicles  requiring decertification/recertification  actions.    (T-1).    Send  an  unclassified  e-mail  with  registration numbers  and  pictures,  as  needed,  along  with  short  narrative  justification  describing  desired actions to 441VSCOS.AF.VehMgt@us.af.mil. decertification/recertification for and rationale 4.13.5.  FM&A will monitor vehicle MNCL data report on VM Neighborhood that identifies data fidelity errors in activity-level generated reports; this report is “informational only” and not a system of record.  (T-1). 4.14.  Scheduled Maintenance Requirements and Planning. 4.14.1.  Scheduled  maintenance  includes  PM&I,  Vehicle  Condition  Inspections  and  Special Inspections, at regular intervals to maintain a safe and serviceable vehicle fleet.  All PM&I will be  conducted  using  the  AF  Form  4354,  Vehicle  Preventive  Maintenance  and  Inspection (PM&I) in conjunction with applicable manufacturer maintenance requirements, at intervals established in TO 36-1-191.  (T-1). 4.14.1.1.  Do not delay PM&I, Special Inspections or any special scheduled maintenance actions. 4.14.1.2.  Using  organizations  will  make  vehicles  available  for  PM&I  and  Special Inspections or make other arrangements with servicing vehicle management activity before due.    (T-1)    Using  organizations  that  exhibit  a  trend  of  failing  to  provide  vehicles  for scheduled  maintenance  when  due  or  at  the  scheduled  time  will  be  reported  to  the  next command  level  (i.e.,  Mission  Support  Group  Commander,  Wing  Commander,  etc.)  for corrective action. 4.14.2.  Consider  seasonal  needs,  labor-hour  availability,  organizational  need  and  fair apportionment of vehicles or vehicular equipment with PMI requirements when developing a scheduled  maintenance  plan.    All  shops  will  use  On-Line  Vehicle  Integrated  Management System  (OLVIMS)  products  or  other  automated  listings  to  help  complete  work  on  time.  Scheduled maintenance has priority and is not delayed.  (T-1).  When necessary, resort to a two-shift operation, overtime or contract to fulfill this need. 106 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 4.14.3.  Vehicles  used  as  static  training  aids  (not  operated  on  base  or  public  highways)  are exempt  from  scheduled  maintenance.    In  addition,  vehicles  such  as  mobile  communication vans  positioned  in  a  semi-permanent  or  permanent  site  are  exempt.    Perform  scheduled maintenance  before  operating  these  vehicles  over  public  roads.    (T-1).    Training  aids  are accountable on equipment account list. 4.14.4.  Develop, as necessary, work cards and checklists for certain vehicle types or special inspection and servicing requirements.  Bilingual work cards and checklists may be mandatory when local national employees are not required to read and speak English. 4.14.5.  Vehicle  Condition  Inspections  .    Technicians  must  use  AF  Form  4355,  Vehicle Incoming Inspection, to verify a vehicle‘s condition when initiating an AF Form 1823, Vehicle and Equipment Work Order, or AF Form 1823-1 (computer generated) Vehicle and Equipment Work Order, and accepting a vehicle in to maintenance.  (T-1). Notes: 1.  The completion of an AF Form 4355 is not required for “Tire-Only Work Orders” or “Follow-On” warranty/contract work orders. 2.  AF Form 1823 is used only in the event that OLVIMS is not available.  AF Form 1823-1 is an OLVIMS computer generated Vehicle and Equipment Work Order and is the preferred form for documenting vehicle maintenance associated data/information.  However, specific use and documentation requirements listed in this AFI are identical.  For this reason, the term “AF Form 1823/-1” is used in this AFI to signify that the context of information is applicable to either form. 4.15.  Ensure ETIC Accuracy. 4.15.1.  ETICs will represent the “best estimate” on when all vehicle repairs are accomplished and the vehicle is projected to be returned to use. 4.15.2.  The new ETIC field in OLVIMS will be populated for all vehicles with an open work order.  (T-1).  Once a work order is open a new ETIC will be established.  (T-1).  Blank “new ETIC” fields are not authorized for any vehicle with an open work order. 4.15.3.  ETICs for vehicles awaiting disposition instructions will be the projected date that the vehicle will receive the highest level of disposition instructions.  (T-1). 4.15.4.  The new ETIC will not have a historical date (yesterday or older).  (T-1).  ETICs will be updated as needed to ensure most accurate estimates are projected.  (T-1). 4.16.  Conduct Yard Checks Weekly. 4.16.1.  From home screen press Alt F2, then press Alt F6. 4.16.2.  Select all options and print Yard Check Listing. 4.16.3.  Walk through the VM compound, yard(s) or controlled area and validate all vehicles listed on Yard Check Listing are in VM control and the status is accurate in OLVIMS.  If not, research and take appropriate action to correct. 4.16.4.  Identify  all  vehicles  in  the  compound  not  reflected  on  the  Yard  Check  Listing.  Ascertain reason the vehicles are not on the Yard Check Listing and take appropriate action to correct as needed. AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 107 4.16.5.  Yard checks will be completed weekly or more often as determined by the VFM/VMS.  (T-1). 4.17.  Ensure Annual Serviceability Inspections are Conducted Using AF Form 4355. 4.17.1.  FM&A will ensure that an AF Form 4355 has been performed (via processing an AF Form 1823/-1) for each registered vehicle annually.  (T-1).  Completion of the inspection can be accomplished via mobile maintenance or shop visit; provided an AF 1823/-1 is initiated in OLVIMS.  The use of AF Form 4355 will satisfy the AF obligation to inspect a vehicle‘s ability to  operate  safely  at  least  once  within  a  12-month  period,  IAW  DODM  4500.36.    Refer  to paragraph 7.37 for AF Form 4355 completion instructions. 4.17.2.  441  VSCOS  will  distribute  reports  quarterly  to  respective  bases  for  compliance verification action.  (T-1). 4.17.2.1.  The report will list vehicles that have NOT had an AF Form 1823/-1 reported (opened) within the proceeding12-month period.  (T-1).  FM&A will review the report and take action to ensure compliance.  (T-1). 4.17.2.2.  Report  will  contain  MAJCOM,  OLVIMS  Base/Site  Code,  vehicle  registration number, Base and Unit details.  (T-1). 4.18.  Verify Parts Charges in OLVIMS Daily.  Refer to paragraphs 5.2.20. and  5.14. 4.19.  Manage TCTOs, Service Bulletins, Manufacture Recalls and OTIs.  Control of TCTOs, SBs and OTIs.  TCTOs are managed differently than regular TOs.  They must be requisitioned individually and as a series they must be identified for automatic distribution.  TCTOs, SBs and OTIs are managed IAW the following procedures: 4.19.1.  Robins  AFB  SE&V  or  FSE  Item  Managers  notifies  441  VSCOS  of  newly  released TCTOs,  SBs  and  OTIs.    441  VSCOS  provides  base-level  Vehicle  Management  a  list  of vehicles/FSE requiring the TCTO, SB or OTI action. 4.19.2.  Units must ensure they are on TO distribution listing for each TCTO series.  (T-1).  These series are listed in the “-36” index for the type of vehicle they pertain to.  The TO monitor must review the “-36” index on receipt and ensure that for each type of vehicle assigned, if there  is  an  applicable  TCTO  series  that  it  is  on  distribution.    (T-1).    This  ensures  TCTOs published under that series are sent to the unit. 4.19.3.  FM&A must date stamp each TCTO, SB or OTI once received (electronically dated e-mail/message  traffic  is  sufficient);  determine  TCTO,  SB  or  OTI  action  and/or  parts  kit requirement by reviewing the TCTO, SB or OTI cover page for affected vehicle registration numbers;  and  notify  Materiel  Control  to  order  required  parts  kits  after  determining  and verifying base requirements.  (T-1). 4.19.3.1.  Use “T” prefix for work order numbers when a TCTO will be completed on that work order. 4.19.3.2.  Use “S” prefix for work order numbers when a SB or OTI will be completed on that work order. 4.19.3.3.  Use “B” prefix to order parts (if required). 108 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 4.19.4.  Robins AFB SE&V requires verification that correct TCTO or SB part(s) have been ordered before parts(s) are released for shipment.  Contact the appropriate Program Manager or  Equipment  Specialist  for  the  affected  vehicle  type  by  telephone,  fax  or  electronic  mail, provide vehicle registration numbers and requisition due-in document numbers, obtained from Materiel Control, to enable part(s) release. 4.19.5.  Take continuous supply follow-up action until kits are received. 4.19.6.  Complete  TCTOs,  SBs  and  OTIs  actions  as  soon  as  possible,  before  the  required completion (suspense) date.  TCTO, SB or OTI not completed by the “completion date” will be considered "outstanding" and places the vehicle’s serviceability in jeopardy. 4.19.6.1.  When directed by the Robins AFB SE&V, vehicles with “outstanding” actions will be removed from service until the subject TCTO, SB or OTI is accomplished.  (T-0) (OLVIMS  PCN  SB004-828). 4.19.7.  Record the completion of the TCTO, SB or OTI on the computer-generated Vehicle Historical  Record collect completion/compliance  reporting  via  LIMS-EV  Vehicle  View  monthly  data  files  for completed TCTOs and SBs.  (T-1).  Urgent action TCTO and SB completion reporting will be included with all others, however they may require manual completion reporting depending on time constraints and fleet safety concerns.  (T-1).  441 VSCOS will notify applicable units and ANG as the need arises.  (T-1).   441  VSCOS  will 4.19.8.  When  closing  “T”  or  “S”  prefixed  work  orders  (after  F3  key  is  pushed),  FM&A personnel  must  ensure  the  TCTO/SB  number  entered  into  OLVIMS  is  identical  to  the TCTO/SB number shown in LIMS-EV Vehicle View/TCTO view for that registration number.  (T-1).  If they do not match, the TCTO/SB will still show as due in LIMS-EV Vehicle View. 4.19.9.  Maintain active master TCTO, SB and OTI files.  A rescinded file will be maintained when needed for special programs and projects.  (T-1).  When a rescinded TCTO is needed, it can be obtained by following the procedures in TO 00-5-1-WA-1. 4.19.9.1.  The master file will consist of a binder separated into active and inactive sections.  (T-1).    These  sections  will  be  subdivided  into  four  sections:  TCTOs,  Service  Bulletins, One-Time Inspection Letters/ Messages, and Recalls/Campaigns (separate binders for each type may also be used).  (T-1).  The active section will have an index of all active items and  include  document  number  (TCTO  number,  bulletin  number,  or  date/time  group), document title/description, and status.  Inactive files can be purged 1 year after rescission date.  Electronic files are permissible. 4.19.10.  Verify  TCTO  status  via  LIMS-EV  Vehicle  View.    The  TCTO  view  depicts  four separate, but linked, TCTO requirements by vehicle counts.  The available data views are by vehicle numbers and percent completed.  By toggling between the views, the viewer will have an informed look at an individual TCTO or the status of a larger TCTO program completion level within a filter set. 4.19.10.1.  Access LIMS-EV Vehicle View and click the TCTO tab. 4.19.10.2.  Data points and definitions. 4.19.10.3.  Total required.  Depicts the sum vehicles required to have a TCTO completed on  them  within  the  filter  set.    Source  of  the  vehicle  count  is  a  sum  of  the  registration numbers listed in the TCTO table that matches the filter set. AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 109 4.19.10.4.  Complete.  Depicts the sum  of vehicle registration numbers listed within the filter set that have a “TCTO COMPLETED DATE” listed. 4.19.10.5.  Due/On-Time.  Depicts the sum of vehicle registration numbers in the result set that  require  a  TCTO  be  completed  that  has  not  passed  the  “MUST  BE  DONE  DATE”.  Will be reflected when within 60 days of due date. 4.19.10.6.  Overdue.  Depicts the sum of vehicle registration numbers in the result set that require a TCTO be completed that has passed the “MUST BE DONE DATE”. 4.19.11.  Can toggle between numerical values or percentages in the chart.  If a TCTO/SB has been completed, and a monthly OLVIMS file has passed to LIMS-EV Vehicle View, and the TCTO.  SB is not showing complete, the TCTO/SB may not match between what was input into OLVIMS and what was listed on the TCTO/SB. 4.19.12.  To correct, edit, add or delete TCTO data, use “CZ” transaction.  Must edit “C record” in OLVIMS to match (“CZ”, “CV” and “ZH”). 4.19.13.  OLVIMS data crossed in monthly file uploaded to 441 VSCOS (VYHK0D2T.ZIP). 4.20.  Ensure Reimbursable Units are Coded Correctly in OLVIMS and Perform Follow Up Actions for Financial Recoupment. 4.20.1.  Receive Responsibility Center/Cost Center (RC/CC) code for reimbursable units from Finance. 4.20.2.  Send “?ARAD6C.DA1” file monthly to Finance Budget Office. 4.20.3.  Once file is returned from DFAS, reconcile for accuracy. 4.20.4.  Resubmit  reconciled  “?  ARAD6C.DA1”  file  back  to  Finance  Budget  Office  for recoupment. 4.20.5.  Monitor reimbursement via resource advisor. Note:  Refer to paragraph 7.49. for additional information. 4.20.6.  For OCONUS locations where civilian labor is paid for by host-nation support, delete all affected civilian labor transactions before submitting the OLVIMS accounting and finance file  for  reimbursement.    Only  parts  and  appropriate  civilian  labor  transactions  will  be reimbursed for these locations. 4.21.  Ensure Accurate Man-Hour/Labor Accounting.  Refer to Chapter 7. 4.22.  Vehicle VIL Key and AIM2™ Modules.  Quarterly (or as required), FM&A will provide Fuels Management a master list depicting all assigned vehicles and organization codes to include a break out of all vehicles that have changed since the previous list.  (T-1). 4.22.1.  The list must include the vehicle registration number, unit, all grades of product that will be used (e.g., MUR, MRR, DL1, DL2, CNG, LNG, etc.) and if it is alternative fuel capable.  (T-1). 4.22.2.  Written  operation  procedures  will  be  developed  between  FM&A  and  Fuels Management to ensure notification of VIL Key data field changes or vehicle nontaxable status.  (T-1). Notes: 110 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 1.  Installation Fuels Management is responsible for the Automated Fuel Service Station (AFSS) equipped for VIL or AIM2™ technology. 2.  VIL key or AIM2™ module requirements/policy for alternative fuel vehicles is located in paragraph 11.6.4. 4.23.  Recording Taxable Fuel Consumption.  Current Internal Revenue Service (IRS) guidance identifies fuel for government vehicles operated solely on government installations as exempt from Federal and some state levied taxes.  In order to ensure the DOD obtains appropriate tax credit for the fuel consumed by these vehicles the following procedures must be followed.   (T-0).  If any vehicle  uses  a  county,  state  or  federal  highway  one  or  more  times  during  a  fiscal  quarter,  fuel consumed  by  that  vehicle  is  taxable  for  that  period.    Crossing  over  a  county,  state  or  federal highway at an intersection does not count as use.  All off-road vehicles, e.g., graders, forklifts and K-loaders,  qualify.    Defense  Logistics  Agency  (DLA)  Energy  is  responsible  to  issue  guidance clearly outlining taxable and non-taxable guidelines for DOD fuel  use.  Additional information can be found on the DLA Energy website. Note:  If any vehicle uses a county, state or federal highway one or more times during a fiscal quarter, fuel consumed by that vehicle is taxable for that period.  Crossing over a county, state or federal highway at an intersection does not count as use.  All off-road vehicles, e.g., graders, forklifts and K-loaders, qualify.  Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Energy is responsible to issue guidance clearly outlining taxable and non-taxable guidelines for DOD fuel use.  Additional information can be found on the DLA Energy website. 4.23.1.  VCOs  and  VCNCOs,  in  conjunction  with  FM&A,  must  verify  and  list  all  vehicles designated for travel off the installation during the upcoming quarter.  (T-1). 4.23.2.  Once  finalized,  FM&A  then  forwards  the  list  of  vehicles  expected  to  travel  off  the installation  to  Fuels  Management.    Fuels  Management  then  verifies  each  VIL  or  AIM2™ module is  encoded to  properly  reflect  taxable status  of fuel  to  be consumed by the vehicle. Fuels Management will use this list to encode the VIL with a UC. Note:  Recording of taxable fuel consumption and coding VIL keys accordingly is not a requirement for Air National Guard units. 4.23.3.  Fuel Tax Refund Requests.  The AF is not authorized to seek reimbursement for DLA Energy owned fuel or fuel purchased under a GSA lease as they are purchased under standard pricing.  For information on obtaining reimbursement of fuel taxes on non-DLA Energy owned fuel or fuel purchased under a GSA wet lease, contact the local Accounting and Finance office. 4.24.  Review, Validate and Process Vehicle Authorization Requests. 4.24.1.  Vehicle  Authorization  Review  Authority.    Only  the  minimum  number  of  vehicles necessary to  support the mission will be authorized.  The VFM is  the vehicle authorization review authority for the installation.  The VFM or equivalent: 4.24.1.1.  Reviews and validates vehicle requirements and vehicle change requests. 4.24.1.2.  Recommends increases or decreases in vehicle authorizations. 4.24.2.  Considers the following to address additional vehicle authorizations: 4.24.2.1.  Use  of  vehicles  from  the  U-Drive  It  (UDI)  fleet,  priority  recall,  or  short  term lease/rental to satisfy short duration or sporadic mission requirements. AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 111 4.24.2.2.  Types  and  quantities  of  vehicles  must  clearly  be  the  minimum  number  to accomplish the mission.  (T-1). 4.24.3.  Do not authorize vehicles for reasons of grade, prestige, personal convenience or to individual persons except as previously stated. 4.24.4.  Use LIMS-EV to review vehicle utilization. 4.24.5.  The AS is a seven-digit code which describes the AS used, Base Code and User Code.  For example, the AS Code for a registered fleet vehicle (010) belonging to Langley AFB (LA), LRS Vehicle Mgt Flt (EG) would be: “010LAEG”. 4.24.6.  All additions or changes to vehicle authorizations, require an authorization request to be  processed  through  441  VSCOS.    (T-1).    To  request  a  new  authorization,  or  to  request updates to an existing authorization, send request to 441 VSCOS  via the TRT.  441 VSCOS will work with FM&A for clarification as needed. Note:  Authorization requests applicable to USCENTCOM AOR will be processed through USAFCENT/A4RV, IAW USAFCENT VM Pamphlet 24-302.  (T-1). 4.24.6.1.  Authorized  quantity  increase  due  to  mission  change.    Requests  to  increase vehicle  fleet  size  must  be  supported  by  a  verifiable  mission  change,  e.g.,  OPLAN, Provisional  Plan  (PPLAN),  Executive  Order  (EXORD),  Fragmentary  Order  (FRAGO), base layout, operation moved to a different location on base, added a ramp, etc.  (T-1). 4.24.6.2.  All  new  or  increased  authorizations  will  be  coordinated  with  functional community.  (T-1).  If approved, functional community will request vehicle procurement funding for the initial validated vehicle requirements and advocate additional funding in the  out-years  of  the  Program  Objective  Memorandum  (POM)  for  increased  vehicle  buy replacement dollars.  (T-1). 4.24.6.3.  Any non-mission change increase will be offset by adjustments to other vehicle authorizations to preclude an overall increase in authorizations.  (T-1).  Even if an offset authorization  is  provided,  the  requesting  vehicle  management  activity  must  provide sufficient justification to support changing the authorization by answering the questions in paragraph 4.24.9.  (T-1).  Additionally, the vehicle type being requested must be in line with the “core set” of authorizations for the using organization.  (T-1).  All adjustments to authorization  quantities  must  be  approved  by  441  VSCOS.    (T-1).    Additionally,  all approved  new  or those  resulting  from  a PROTAF/SATAF  and  alike)  will  not  be  added  to  the  Accountable  Property  System  of Record (APSR) until the using organization/functional community transfers procurement funds to the central procurement agency for the initial vehicle requirements.  (T-1). increased  authorizations (including 4.24.6.3.1.  Units  with  a  requirement  and  funds  will  contact  servicing  Vehicle Management activity.  (T-1). 4.24.6.3.2.  Vehicle Management ensures requirement has: valid authorization, current vehicle is replacement eligible, or authorization is vacant. 4.24.6.3.3.  Vehicle  Management  works  with  441  VSCOS  to  ensure  requirement  is procurable (not on Robins no buy list.) 112 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 4.24.6.3.4.  Vehicle Management obtains sample MIPR from 441 VSCOS and provides (with instructions) to requesting unit RA/FM for completion.   Note:  One MIPR per NSN request. 4.24.6.3.5.  After  authorization  is  validated,  asset  is  deemed  procurable,  Vehicle Management forwards completed to 441 VSCOS for processing.  (T-1). 4.24.6.3.6.  441 VSCOS works with Robins to complete order. 4.24.6.3.7.  Vehicles are tracked using LIMS-EV Due-In screen until arrival. 4.24.6.4.  Offset authorization(s) must be equal to or greater than the purchase price of the authorization(s) being requested.  (T-1).  The purchase price to be used for comparison is the unit cost listed in the VMIF for the I&S NSNs of the authorizations being compared, regardless of whether the authorization is for a government owned or lease vehicle. 4.24.6.5.  Purchase  price  for  offset  authorization  request  will  not  be  considered  if  the authorization  being  requested  is  more  environmentally  friendly  than  the  offset authorization and of similar/smaller size/type. Note: Refer to paragraph 4.76.2. for SUV offsets. 4.24.7.  Authorization Analysis.  The objective of the analysis is to validate the requirement and determine whether a more effective avenue, such as short-term leasing or co-utilization of assets, can satisfy the requirement without adding additional authorizations.  The VFM will use the conclusions of the analysis to make approval/disapproval.  (T-1). 4.24.8.  Justification Requirements.  The following data is required on all new authorization and  change  request.    Any  request  that  does  not  contain  all  required  data  available  will  be returned for completion. 4.24.8.1.

(T-1). 4.25.1.  LIMS-EV Vehicle View is a “Data Service” that serves as the overarching gateway to AF/A4  enterprise  reporting  and  analysis.    LIMS-EV  Vehicle  View  provides  a  consolidated look at vehicle accountability and sustainment data.  Data comes from the Integrated Logistics System-Supply  (ILS-S)  and  OLVIMS  and  is  merged  with  supplemental  tables  that  are maintained by 441 VSCOS.  As a result, all information is placed into a usable and accessible format.  (See Attachment 4 for LIMS-EV Vehicle View navigation details). 4.25.2.  All inventory/accountability data comes from ILS-S. sustainment from data comes base level  OLVIMS files, all 4.25.3.  Units will upload “Daily” and “Monthly” OLVIMS files onto the VM Neighborhood.  (T-1).  Monthly files must be updated by the 15th of the month.  (T-1).  On the 21st of each month, the previous month‘s data will be displayed in LIMS-EV Vehicle View. 4.25.4.  ILS-S data is brought into LIMS-EV Vehicle View daily from the AF data warehouse. 4.25.5.  Robins AFB SE&V will use the Consolidated Analysis and Reporting System (CARS 2.0) program to update the due-in information into LIMS-EV Vehicle View.  (T-1).  This is daily feed.  Twice a day LIMS-EV Vehicle View conducts an Extract Transform Load (ETL) (0830 and 2030 US Eastern Time) and pulls in data from the VM Neighborhood and the data 116 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 warehouse  or  other  designated  location.    At  that  time,  files  that  were  uploaded  to  the  VM Neighborhood or designated location are checked for errors. 4.25.6.  If  errors  exist,  files  will  be  ignored  and  the  last  “good”  file  will  continue  to  be displayed. 4.25.7.  Units will check the VED and ensure their current files were updated.  (T-1).  If a file was uploaded, and is not reflected in LIMS-EV Vehicle View, contact 441 VSCOS. 4.25.8.  VED.  The VED is located on the VM Neighborhood.  The dashboard is broken down into tabs and is updated once a month (ILS-S Reports, OLVIMS Reports, Data Upload Metrics and Applications).  The only exception is the ILS-S Reports (Vacancies/Overages Panel) which is updated daily.  Each tab contains specific panels with a built-in search.  All panels open to full  screen  and  contain  moveable/filterable  columns  that  are  exportable.    Data  files  can  be download in  Excel,  however all filters must be removed before download will execute or a download error will occur. 4.26.  Using the TRT to Request ILS-S Updates. 4.26.1.  ILS-S  is  the  “accountable”  system  for  all  AF  managed  vehicles.    441  VSCOS  will accomplish all vehicle transactions in ILS-S.  (T-1). 4.26.2.  The TRT is the transaction-requesting interface between FM&A and 441 VSCOS . 4.26.3.  Access CRIS Tool via LIMS-EV VEHICLE VIEW or save link for accessing directly. 4.26.4.  FM&A will use the TRT to request updates to ILS-S for the following transactions:  (T-1). Note:  Lease vehicles can fill vacant Government Owned authorizations.  Government (Blue Fleet) vehicles will not be used to fill open leased vehicle ”AS 012” authorizations. 4.26.4.1.  Receiving a new vehicle.

(T-1). 4.26.5.7.  Once  processed,  441  VSCOS  will  mark  request  as  complete  and  request  will move to “Completed” status.  (T-1). 4.26.5.8.  Local FM&A is the liaison between AFVFSB and supply.  Local FM&A/bases are responsible  for all “accountable” supply documents to  include  completing local  and MAJCOM  forms.    IL-S  access  is  required  to  attain  accountable  documents.    See  local Supply Document Control for accountable documents lists and local form requirements.  See  base  supply  for  details.    AFVFSB  will  provide  “RVP”  and  “FCH”  documents  to FM&A.  (T-1). 4.26.5.9.  DELETED. 4.26.5.10.  Completed requests are updated real-time in the TRT after requests are initiated.  Each installation‘s ILS-S data is passed to the warehouse on different intervals.  Contact the servicing Supply Customer Service section for base specific times/intervals. 4.27.  Filling Vehicle Authorization with Most Suitable Asset. 4.27.1.  FM&A MUST fill vehicle authorizations with assets that match the prime authorized vehicle type if available in the fleet (B200 authorization filled with B200 asset).  (T-1).  If a prime  vehicle  is  not  available,  fill  the  authorization  with  the  most  suitable  asset  in  the inventory. 4.28.  Managing Vehicles Awaiting Disposition. 4.28.1.  Vehicles  awaiting  disposition  are  vehicles,  no  longer  having  a  local  authorization, which  cannot  be  redistributed  to  fill  vacant  authorizations  or  be  reassigned  to  replace  less serviceable and/or maintainable (usually older) vehicles eligible for replacement.  Vehicles in this  status  will  not  be  assigned  to  organizations  waiting  approval  for  additional  vehicle requirements.  VM  will have physical  possession of these vehicles and  FM&A will control vehicles pending disposition direction.  (T-1). 4.28.2.  When authorization is no longer warranted, and reassignment to another base activity is not possible, request vehicle be moved to 048??EG authorization via the TRT.  Status codes for Awaiting Disposition vehicles are as follows: 4.28.2.1.  D--  Disposition maintenance, transfer to DLA-DS, sale, etc. instructions  have  been received,  pending shipment, 4.28.2.2.  E--  Vehicle  is  unserviceable.    Accountability  is  maintained  until  transfer  to DLA-DS.  Cannibalization is authorized prior to transferring to DLA-DS. 118 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 4.28.2.3.

Initiate  follow-up  action  30  calendar  days  after  the  date  the  LTI  was  sent  to  441 VSCOS. 4.28.5.  Awaiting  Disposition  assets  will  not  be  used  for  deployments  or  special  projects without 441 VSCOS approval.  (T-0). 4.29.  Review, Validate and Process Rental/Lease Requests. 4.29.1.  Vehicle rental/leases are vehicles on loan from a local vendor with payment made on a recurring basis. 4.29.2.  Vehicle rental/lease administration. 4.29.2.1.  Starting in FY14, all leasing of passenger carrying vehicles will occur through the LRS.  Funding will be consolidated to the **542f PEs under cost category 43100 and 43200.  Units with new leasing needs will coordinate their requirements thru the LRS. 4.29.2.1.1.  Recruiting rental/lease requirements will be coordinated/processed through 441 VSCOS.  (T-1). 4.29.2.2.  LOG  Panel/LRS  funding  for  long  term  leases  have  been  centralized  to  a  441 VSCOS account. 4.29.2.3.  Units with new leasing requirements will coordinate requirements thru the LRS.  (T-1). 4.29.2.4.  LRS  will  determine  where  funding  origination  stream  lies  to  pay  for  lease vehicles  (unit  or  LOG  Panel).  441  VSCOS  can  provide  assistance  with  funding  source determination as requested. 4.29.2.5.  If LOG Panel/LRS funded source has been determined, the requesting unit will work with their functional community PEM, who will in-turn work with LOG Panel PEM to transfer funding across the FYDP to 441 VSCOS, prior to vehicles being leased, or for GSA vehicles being moved to BOAC 5738SY.  (T-1). 4.29.2.6.  This does not imply that all AF leases are funded through LOG Panel/LRS. 4.29.2.7.  Units outside the LOG Panel have vehicle lease funding. 4.29.3.  When a GSA vehicle is not available, DOD components may rent/lease motor vehicles from a commercial vendor when any of these conditions exist: 4.29.3.1.

(T-1).  Vehicle rental/leases must be charged to the O&M funds of the installation the MTF supports, or as directed by AF/A4LR  (T-0).  MTFs are  not  authorized  to  establish  vehicle  rental/leases  outside  of  those  established  by  the installation.    All  vehicle  requirements,  whether  rented/leased  or  purchased,  are  the responsibility of AF/A4LR. 4.29.8.  The LRS Commander or equivalent will coordinate on all rental/lease requests prior to submission to contracting.  (T-1). 4.29.8.1.  The  AFOSI  Fleet  Manager  may  approve  short/long  term  rental/lease  request supporting OSI requirements and does not require LRS Commander coordination. 4.29.9.  Upon termination of a vehicle rental/lease FM&A verifies charges. 4.29.10.  Short-Term  Rental/Lease.    Use  GSA  short-term  lease/rental  program  when economically advantageous to the AF.  (T-1).  LRS Commanders or equivalents may authorize vehicle rentals/leases to meet peak workloads and unusual or emergency requirements.  (T-1).  Vehicle  leases/rentals  are  funded  by  unit  O&M  funds.    Rentals/Leases  will  not  exceed  120 days.    See  AFI  65-601,  Volume  1,  Budget  Guidance  and  Procedures,  Section  10M,  for guidance  pertaining  to  leases.    (T-1).    When  available  and  meets  mission  operational requirement, short-term rental/lease vehicles will be an AFV.  (T-1) 4.29.10.1.  Do  not  use  this  authority  to  provide  transportation  for  normal  or  routine purposes, when vehicles are available. 120 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 4.29.10.2.  441 VSCOS will be notified if any rental/lease vehicle is required for more than 60 days.  (T-1).  441 VSCOS  will provide a “short-term lease form” to be completed by local fleet manager.  (T-1).  When notifying 441 VSCOS, FM&A will specify the vehicle type,  quantity  and  anticipated  duration  of  the  rental/lease  requirement.   (T-1).  Rentals/leases that exceed 120 days are not authorized unless a valid authorization has been established.  Rental/leases that exceed 18 months must be coordinated with contracting and must  be  justified  IAW  Defense  FAR  Supplement  (DFARS)  Part  207,  Acquisition Management, current edition.  (T-0). 4.29.10.3.  Use GSA vehicles when available.  Confirm non-availability from 441 VSCOS before  executing  a  non-GSA  commercial  rental/lease  exceeding  60  days  for  general-purpose  vehicles.    Keep  non-availability  certification  documents  for  the  duration  of  the lease period. 4.29.10.4.  Consecutive short-term rentals/leases are not authorized. Note: All requests for rental/leases request exceeding 120 days are justified using the 441 VSCOS-approved vehicle justification request format and forwarded to 441 VSCOS for action before entering into a rental/lease agreement through contracting.  Approved requests must be retained for the duration of the lease period.  (T-1). 4.29.11.  Long-Term  Rental/Lease.    Leasing  over  120  days  is  generally  to  fill  open authorizations  not  filled through  normal  acquisition  procedures.    Leased  assets  must  be  the same  type  and  class  as  the  authorization  to  which  they  are  assigned.    (T-0).    When  the appropriate size vehicle is not available through GSA or a local vendor to fill an approved lease authorization,  a  smaller  or  larger  class  (not  to  exceed  a  class  restriction)  vehicle  may  be temporarily substituted as long as there is no additional cost to the government and approved by 441 VSCOS.  A non-availability statement must be obtained from the leasing agency and kept on file to support the unauthorized class vehicle being provided.  (T-0). Note:  When available, long-term rental/lease vehicles will be an AFV. 4.29.11.1.  Funding  for  Long-Term  rental/leased  Vehicles.    Vehicle  rentals/leases  are funded by unit O&M funds. 4.29.12.  DELETED. 4.29.12.1.  DELETED. 4.29.13.  Insurance Coverage and Maintenance for Rented/Leased Vehicles. 4.29.13.1.  “For Hire” solicitations and resulting contracts provide insurance coverage as prescribed by applicable portions of the FARs.  Unless the rental/lease company requires purchasing  insurance,  rented/leased  vehicles  are  obtained  with  the  AF  providing  self-insurance. Note:  The U.S. government is self-insured for loss of damage to government property and the liability of government employees for actions within the scope of their duties.  Claims for injury or death of third parties, or damage to third party property, arising from federal employee negligence in the operation of government-furnished vehicles are covered by the Federal Tort Claims Act. AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 121 4.29.14.  Vehicle  operators  conduct  daily  operator  care  on  rented/leased  vehicles  unless otherwise specified in the contract. 4.29.15.  GSA  approved  local  vendors  perform  all  maintenance  on  rented/leased  vehicles, unless  prior  agreements  are  made  showing  it  is  more  economical  for  the  AF  to  perform maintenance or for matters of military necessity.  All waivers must be submitted and approved by AF/A4LR prior to any maintenance action taken on the vehicle fleet.  (T-0).  AF/A4LR will only approve waivers based on the lack of a commercial maintenance facility within the local area or within permissible operating distance from the base.  (T-1). 4.29.16.  Installation of Radio Equipment in rented/leased vehicles.  When two-way radio sets are required, rent/lease vehicles with radio equipment already installed.  Install radio sets in rented/leased  vehicles  when  it  is  not  economical  to  rent/lease  the  radio  equipment,  or  use portable or non-fixed radios when feasible. 4.29.17.  Exceptions  for  Acquiring,  Renting  or  Leasing  Foreign  Made  Buses.    Federal  law requires the armed forces to use US manufactured buses to satisfy requirements, unless their use is not economical or not in the best interest of the US Government.  The rule applies when a  purchase,  rent/lease  or  contractual  arrangements  are  made  for  transportation  services.  Exceptions to Federal Law are: 4.29.17.1.  When  US  manufactured  buses  are  not  available  to  meet  requirements  that cannot be postponed, foreign manufactured buses may be used temporarily.  However, the rental/lease  contract  agreement  time  frame  must  not  exceed  the  lead-time  required  for acquiring and delivering US manufactured buses.  (T-1)  A waiver request will be sent to 441 VSCOS if it is not economically feasible to rent/lease US manufactured buses.  (T-1). 4.29.17.2.  Where  foreign  manufactured  buses  are  available  at  no  direct  or  indirect acquisition cost to the US Government. 4.29.17.3.  When  lease  or  procurement  of  indigenous  foreign  buses  are  necessary  to comply with FP/AT mission/personnel transportation security requirements in vulnerable operating regions/locations.  In this case, request for waiver to DFAR Subpart 225.7004 will  be  processed  through  the  head  of  the  MAJCOM/AFICA  contracting  agency  for approval.  (T-2). 4.29.18.  GSA will send annual lease list to 441 VSCOS for review/approval.  441 VSCOS will ensure leased assets comply with energy policies (right size, etc.) and return AF approved list to GSA for execution.  (T-1).  Refer to paragraph 8.11.1.1. 4.29.19.  Each host base  fleet  manager  will provide customer  fleet  management support for GSA  lease  vehicles  regardless  of  assigned  unit  or  BOAC/funding  source,  unless  otherwise directed by regulations or executed contract operation.  (T-1). 4.30.  Correct Errors on Data System Reconciliation Listings Identified on VED. 4.30.1.  To correct OLVIMS organization code, FM&A must first request a new organization code list from 441 VSCOS.  (T-1). 4.30.2.  Using  the  “new  organization  code  list”  identify  organization  codes  for  loading  in OLVIMS using a highlighter. 122 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 4.30.2.1.  This is easily accomplished by printing out the vehicle master list in LIMS-EV Vehicle View. 4.30.2.2.  The  last  two  characters  of  the  allowance  source  code  (ASC)  will  identify  the organization codes  used  on a specific base.   For  example:   ASC “010SWJP”:    “010”—identifies Registered Fleet (012 identifies Leased); “SW”—identifies Shaw as the assigned base; “JP”—identifies the using org code JP, which is CES Operations Flight. 4.30.2.3.  Using the “OZ” transaction in OLVIMS create the new Organization Codes 4.30.2.4.  During the process, validation of the following should occur: 4.30.2.4.1.  Validate the “RC/CC Code” with the Financial Management Flight. 4.30.2.4.2.  Validate  the  “Owning”  and  “Using  Commands”  with  MAJCOM  or  441 VSCOS. 4.30.2.4.3.  Validate the “R/D code” with the Financial Management Flight. 4.30.2.4.4.  Validate the “Force Activity Indication (FAD) Code” with the LRS Supply Customer Service Section. 4.30.2.5.  After creating new organization codes using the “OZ” transaction, FM&A must process an “AT” transaction in OLVIMS for each vehicle assigned, by registration number, to include those that are in Awaiting Disposition status.  (T-1). 4.30.2.5.1.  “AT” transactions are not accepted for vehicles with open work orders or those previously transferred in the current month.  For those with open work orders, there are two options to accomplish the “AT” transaction: 4.30.2.5.1.1.  Option  1  (easiest  but  harder  to  track)  –  Accomplish  the  “AT” transaction after the work order closes. 4.30.2.5.1.2.  Option  2  (more  difficult,  however  accomplishes  the  entire  fleet)  – Close open work orders, accomplish the “AT” transaction and then re-open each work order 1-minute after it has been closed. 4.30.2.6.  Use a copy of PCN 24 as checklist to validate “AT” transaction on all vehicles loaded in OLVIMS. 4.30.2.6.1.  Once validation is complete, use a new PCN 24 and re-validate, looking specifically for the former organization codes. 4.30.2.7.  Using the “OT” transaction in OLVIMS delete all old organization codes. 4.30.2.8.  MELs will have to be updated in OLVIMS using the “OE” transaction since they are linked to organization codes. 4.31.  DELETED. 4.32.  Process LTIs. 4.32.1.  Process  requests  for  repair  authority  and  disposition  instructions for  vehicles  to  the using OLVIMS AFTO Form 91 Automated LTI function. 4.32.2.  Guidelines for determining repair allowances and approval levels are in TO 36-1-191. AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 123 4.32.3.  All LTIs for disposition/maintenance repair consideration will be sent to 441 VSCOS via upload to the LIMS-EV Vehicle View/Transaction Request Tool (TRT) for decision.  (T-1). Note:  To request disposition instructions for AFOSI vehicles FM&A will forward AFTO Form 91, Limited Technical Inspection-Motor Vehicle to HQ AFOSI, e-mail: lg.office@ogn.af.mil.  AFOSI Command Fleet Manager will submit LTI for disposition instructions through the TRT, then forward instructions to the local requesting FM&A.  (T-1). 4.32.3.1.  Only  direct to serviceability/functioning of asset will be used to determine if a vehicle is economically repairable.  Do not include aesthetics such as corrosion control, paint complete, etc. labor  and  parts  costs for  actual repairs related 4.32.3.2.  441 VSCOS forwards all LTIs for AF M-Series vehicles in Awaiting Disposition status to the IM for disposition action. 4.32.4.  Vehicles requiring an LTI for acceptance, disposition action and repair decisions are processed within 10 duty days of requirement.  LTIs for shipping must be completed as soon as practical in order to meet RDO requirements (refer to paragraph 8.5.6).  (T-1). 4.32.5.  VFM/VMS must ensure vehicles are shipped in the condition directed by 441 VSCOS.  (T-1). Note:  If parts are removed or additional discrepancies are identified during or after RDO instructions are received the losing unit will make all repairs not reflected on the initial LTI prior to shipment.  (T-1). 4.32.5.1.  The  VFM/VMS  will  personally  inspect  all  vehicles  prior  to  shipment.    (T-1).  Final shipping inspection responsibility may be delegated to the most senior-ranking shop supervisor  during  the  absence  of  the  VFM/VMS.    For  contracted  vehicle  maintenance units,  vehicles  must  be  inspected  and  documentation  completed  IAW  the  PWS.    (T-1).  Ensure  the  agency  directing  the  vehicle  shipment  provides  complete  fund  citation information or written approval from the appropriate transportation account code (TAC) manager for use of the TAC to charge shipping costs.  (T-1). 4.32.5.2.  When  validated  by  441  VSCOS,  the  losing  unit,  including  contracted  vehicle maintenance units, are obligated to reimburse gaining unit for unserviceable conditions not reflected on the LTI used by 441 VSCOS to determine shipment and damage not caused by shipping. 4.32.5.3.  When a vehicle is shipped, it is the losing FM&A responsibility to contact the gaining  FM&A  and  provide  date  shipped,  document  number,  registration  number  and mode  of  shipment.    It  is  the  gaining  FM&A  responsibility  to  follow  up  on  vehicles  in shipment.  In transit visibility will be through normal shipment modes not ILS-S or LIMS-EV VV. 4.32.6.  For vehicles awaiting disposition, when their repairs exceed their dynamic One Time Repair  Limit  (OTRL),  the  Transaction  Request  Tool  (TRT)  will  provide  a  DLA-DS  or RESALE decision.  Prior to submitting to 441 VSCOS, the local VM will have the authority to override the decision to retain the asset and Return To Service (RTS).  (T-1).  If the asset is RTS, the asset will have its life expectancy extended by three years in the Accountable Property System of Record (APSR).  However, if the asset is not RTS and there’s not a projected due-124 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 in within three years, the decision to salvage the asset will result in a decrease of the asset’s authorization or an offset authorization will be required (refer to paragraph 4.24.6.4.). Note:  The above does not apply to excess vehicles and those that the repairs were caused by accident or abuse. 4.32.7.  Vehicles being disposed of though the AF Surplus Vehicle Sales Program (AFSVSP) will be managed IAW Attachment 7, Air Force Surplus Vehicle Sales Program. (T-1) 4.33.  Establish  and  Update  Supply  Organizational  Cost  Center  Records  (OCCR)  518 Record. 4.33.1.  Only one (1) 518 Record for vehicles per base is allowed, unless managing vehicles used by more than one MAJCOM, then establish a separate vehicle 518 Record for each using MAJCOM.  (T-1).  A separate OCCR must be established for vehicle account/s; independent of other type of accounts (Equipment, Bench Stock, etc.).  (T-1). 4.33.2.  When reviewing 518 Record, ensure the following fields are complete and correct: 4.33.2.1.  “Organization the  Unit managing/signing  vehicle  account;  normally  LRS.    For  example,  if  the  63rd  LRS manages/signs account (CA/CRL), organizational ID is “0063LGR70000”. the  organization ID  of ID” field  contains 4.33.2.2.  The "MAJCOM" field is automatically populated by servicing supply function based on organization ID provided.  Data is acquired from ROF record in AFEMS. 4.33.2.3.  The “Using  Command” field contains the command that programs replacement for  the  vehicles  assigned  to  a  particular  account.    This  is  the  true  owner  of  the  vehicle assets. 4.33.2.4.  The  “Organization  Title”  field  is  automatically  populated  by  servicing  supply function based on organization ID provided.  Data is acquired from ROF record in AFEMS. 4.33.2.5.  The "Type Organization" field will have a “V” assigned.  This identifies OCCR is only used for vehicle account(s). Note:  Contact the servicing supply function for assistance. 4.34.  Accountable Document Responsibilities.  FM&A is responsible for acquiring, signing and forwarding  any  AFPS  accountable  document  to  the  applicable  office  responsible  for  document control responsibilities.  (T-1).  This includes document in R59 listing and providing supporting justifications  and/or  documentation  for  supply  reports  such  as  “M-10”.    The  AF  Vehicle  Fleet Support Branch (AFVFSB) of 441 VSCOS will provide “RVP” and “FCH” documents to FM&A.  (T-1).  Local FM&A is the liaison between AFVFSB and LRS Materiel Management Branch. 4.34.1.  The  “R-59”  is  an  accountable  system  generated  report  which  contains  accountable documents required for processed transactions (documents become delinquent five days after transaction date). 4.34.2.  The “M-10” is an Inventory Adjustment Document register (Monthly) which contains all inventory adjustment records (IAD) and identity changes (FCH) for the previous month.  This  list  is  managed  by  Materiel  Management  Branch  and  briefed  to  LRS  Commander  for his/her signature. 4.34.3.  DELETED. AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 125 4.34.4.  DELETED. 4.35.  Serve  as  Inspector  for  Vehicle  Equipment  Account  and  Receive  Required Training.  This requirement is outlined in AFI 23-110. 4.35.1.  A person (or personnel) from FM&A will be appointed in writing by LRS Commander.  (T-1). 4.36.  Perform  Analysis.  FM&A  is  the  focal  point  for  collecting,  storing,  analyzing  and correcting vehicle data used for analysis. 4.36.1.  Effective  vehicle  management  includes  continuous  process  improvement  by constantly assessing customer needs, analyzing services and monitoring efficiency, economy, utilization  and  cost  of  the  vehicle  fleet.    The  VFM/VMS  are  responsible  for  ensuring  the analysis for evaluating fleet performance is accomplished.  Fully document decisions, process improvements or corrective action taken as a result of analyst recommendations.  Monitoring and controlling performance indicators (metrics) are usually done by exception when requested by VFM/VMS; however, the following indicators will be monitored monthly: 4.36.1.1.  NMC rates.  (T-1). 4.36.1.2.  Costs (per mile, per vehicle, and total).  (T-1). 4.36.1.3.  Maintenance (scheduled, delayed, and unscheduled).  (T-1). 4.36.1.4.  Labor-hours (direct, indirect productive and indirect non-productive).  (T-1). 4.36.1.5.  Utilization analysis.  (T-1). 4.36.2.  VMIF.  This file is the source document for several data elements used in FM&A for management  of  the  vehicle  fleet.    Section  II  of  the  file  provides  NSN,  management  code, replacement criteria and standard pricing information for all vehicles.  Use of this section helps correct programming of OLVIMS vehicle master records and communications compatibility between  VMIF  and  ILS-S  functions  within  the  LRS.    This  file  provides  information  for identifying suitable substitutes for similar vehicle types. 4.37.  Degree of Analysis.  Circumstances will dictate varying degrees of analysis.  VFM/VMS makes the call as to what performance indicator(s) will be analyzed, charted, plotted or otherwise trended, and sets the frequencies for such analysis.  OLVIMS PCN SB004-115 will satisfy the data display requirements.  LIMS-EV Vehicle View also can display data requirements. 4.37.1.  The  level  of  performance  achieved  or  the  symptomatic  condition  of  the  indicator dictates which analysis action to follow. 4.37.1.1.  An indicator well within a set standard may not need any more analysis for that reporting period. 4.37.1.2.  An  indicator  just  barely  within  a  standard  will  need  some  analysis  for  that reporting period; it may need some analysis to find out why, whether corrective action is needed or other areas it may affect. 4.37.1.3.  An indicator that points to poor performance, worsening trends or unfavorable effects  that  may  go  on  if  not  stopped,  calls  for  in-depth  analysis.    In-depth  analysis  is "analysis  that  shows  a  performance  deficiency  or  failure  to  reach  a  goal,  explains  why, 126 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 shows the effect of the deficiency or substandard performance and outlines action that will help reach the goal. 4.37.2.  Analysis  of  the  areas  set  by  commanders  or  equivalents,  441  VSCOS  and  the VFM/VMS make up most of the analysis effort by FM&A.  The analyst must be aware of the savings in manpower and material cost, and the greater mission capabilities that may be gained by a more detailed analysis.  (T-1).  During an in-depth analysis, certain factors perceived as the primary cause of the problem may not be the root of the problem.  The scope of the analysis then is expanded, the true cause determined and corrective action is identified. 4.37.3.  Independent studies and analyses may not provide a definite conclusion when viewed alone.  There are times when a larger base of data is needed; a sampling may need a longer span of time; a first look shows nothing significant is expected to result; or when the end can be confidently predicted without doing a formal study. 4.37.4.  Studies and analyses may take the analyst out of the office.  The analyst goes where the data is or where the process is conducted; this requires reviewing vehicle records jackets and vehicle historical records in FM&A, material cost data in Materiel Control, and sometimes working with a supervisor in the work center. 4.38.  Using  Analysis  Products.  The  use  of  analysis  helps  management  project  existing capabilities into plans and schedules and institute controls  against variation.  The results of the review and analysis of collected data are needed in all successful planning phases.  To be of benefit, analysis and recommendations are used as soon as possible after completion.  Presentations are brief,  factual,  easily  understood  and  must  show  the  picture  as  it  presently  exists.    (T-1).    Most effective analysis is in response to VFM/VMS requests for special studies. 4.38.1.  AF/A4LR, may impose standards or develop goals for performance measurement. 4.38.1.1.  Standards or goals developed by a MAJCOM are tempered with considerations such  as  geographical  location,  seasonal  peculiarities,  deployment  tempo,  military  and civilian staff mix, fleet age or composition, and parts availability. 4.38.1.2.  A large part of resource management is based on comparing a computed average to set standards that allow the significance of a bulk of data to be understood in a single value.  An average may be the usual amount, rate, quality or time. 4.38.2.  A goal is a measure taken by general consent to be a basis for comparison.  A standard may be based on analyzing past data alone, past data weighed with known values or on expert opinion.    In  any  event,  the  criterion  for  making  a  valid  standard  or  goal  is  founded  on objectivity, suitability and reality.  Some sources from which realistic goals may be set are:  existing programs, maintenance reports, historical reports/records and unit plans and needs. 4.38.3.  The  analysis  process  addresses  two  distinct  phases  that  may  or  may  not  be  used together.  These are “production analysis” and “deficiency analysis”. 4.38.3.1.  Through data gathering and surveillance, production analysis is used to identify problems, highlight any that need additional study and identify areas that may represent a standard of excellence. 4.38.3.2.  The real troubleshooting is done through deficiency analysis as a key part of the analysis process.  Perform deficiency analysis to whatever degree is needed to highlight and bring undesirable performance to an acceptable level. AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 127 4.38.4.  Use LIMS-EV Vehicle View to produce utilization analysis report as follows: 4.38.4.1.  From the LIMS-EV Vehicle View start-up page, click on the “Status” drop-down menu and select “Utilization”. 4.38.4.2.  Go to “Time Increments” and click on the drop-down menu and select “Fiscal Year”.  Pull slide to highlight or encompass the year that data analysis is needed. 4.38.4.3.  Click  the  “All  Organizations”  drop-down  menu  and  select  desired  base;  click “Update”. 4.38.4.4.  In the “Grid View Buy” filter, select “Reg Number”.  Next, select “Organization” in the “Group By” filter. 4.38.4.5.  The  data-grid  will  now  display  utilization  information  for  each  registration number assigned to the organization selected.  A “child row” for each registration number displayed will indicate if the vehicle is “over” or “under” Fiscal Year (FY) mean mileage totals. 4.38.4.6.  DELETED. 4.39.  Method of Presentation.  For standardization, a way to present each performance indicator is given as part of that indicator.  For each of the indicators, the level of performance achieved needs to be graphically displayed in chart form. 4.39.1.  If  an  indicator  does  not  meet  the  established  standard  or  goal,  the  VFM/VMS  is informed and determines if an in-depth analysis is needed. 4.39.2.  The  analysis  or  study  narrative  addresses  such  things  as  the  primary  cause  of  the problem, factors that affect it, recommendations for correcting the deficiency and anticipated time required for correction.  A narrative may be required on all standard indicators each month by the VFM/VMS. 4.40.  Presentation of the Analysis.  Some general presentation rules are: 4.40.1.  Understanding that the value of management information lies in its being used while it is still valid and current.  Strive for its use by the appropriate personnel. 4.40.2.  Use flexible rules and techniques.  There are circumstances when it may be impossible to show a result properly if forced to conform to a rigid method.  When possible, comply with the rules, but deviate if it allows better analysis. 4.40.3.  Make  a  briefing  which  covers  the  collected  data  in  a  professional  way.    Briefings address such things as "what, where, how, when and why" and suggest corrective or preventive actions.  Briefings are concise, clear and easily understood by those to whom they are directed. 4.40.4.  Set up a program to coordinate analysis findings with the VFM/VMS before the formal presentation to the LRS Commander or equivalent each month or as scheduled. 4.40.5.  Show statistical or narrative data in some usable form.  Properly tabulate and arrange data  for  analysis  or  projection.    Data  credibility  suffers  when  shown  in  a  confusing  or unfamiliar way.  Keep it simple and key the presentation  to  those who will review it.   The following aids in making graphic presentations: 128 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 4.40.5.1.  Plan the construction in advance; keep it simple, honest and accurate.  Do not give the wrong impression. 4.40.5.2.  Start scale values at zero, or bracket the reference point, and keep the background clear of unnecessary gridlines. 4.40.5.3.  Name  the  presentation  fully  and  accurately;  use  one  subject  at  a  time  to  keep from crowding the material. 4.40.5.4.  Use  short  but  complete  notes  where  necessary  and  be  sure  the  presentation  is informative. 4.41.  Performance Indicators (Metrics). 4.41.1.  The OSD has issued guidance (DoDM 4500.36) to measure and monitor labor-hour productivity within DOD Vehicle Management activities for the following purposes: 4.41.1.1.  To support vehicle repair decisions and develop budgets at base level. 4.41.1.2.  To determine the number of delayed work-hours attributed to lack of available personnel. 4.41.1.3.  To identify training needs, job performance evaluations, shop equipment, tools and facility upgrades. 4.41.1.4.  To  determine  the  management  efficiency  of  individuals,  work  centers, management activities and higher headquarters. 4.41.1.5.  To determine if Vehicle Management personnel are being used efficiently. 4.41.2.  The VFM/VMS,  LRS Commander or equivalent,  MAJCOM or 441 VSCOS  makes use  of  these  indicators,  or  develop  their  own  indicators  to  meet  their  own  circumstances.  Indicators  are  analyzed  as  prescribed  by  the  VFM/VMS  and  recommended  actions  are provided  if  the  performance  does  not  meet  minimum  standards.    Standard  performance indicators have been automated and can be obtained each month by producing “PCN SB004-115” (OLVIMS Automated Analysis) or using LIMS-EV Vehicle View. 4.42.  Specific  Performance  Indicators  Products.  Various  OLVIMS  products  that  will  be reviewed/monitored monthly, with analysis performed as needed, are listed below in  Table 4.3, Specific Performance Indicator Products.  See AFCSM 24-1 for explanations and examples of performance charts that are part of the OLVIMS Automated Analysis Report. Table 4.3.  Specific Performance Indicator Products. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION Transaction Listing (PCN SB004-005)   Delayed Maintenance Report (PCN SB004-015)  Use this report daily to do a line-by-line edit of work orders.  Correct any data mismatches. Use this report monthly to verify delayed work order status and delayed parts.  In addition, monitor work orders in VDP/NMCS status. AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 129 Vehicle Master List (A) (PCN SB004-023)  Vehicle Static Maintenance Data List (PCN SB004-048)    Cost Analysis   Produce monthly and use to monitor static data and changing data such as cumulative meter readings and one-time repair limits. Use this report as needed verify static data for vehicles not updating on the schedule maintenance listing. O&M analysis is required to ensure that money and manpower are not wasted.  The analysis must identify unfavorable cost trends and prime vehicles or groups of vehicles using large amounts of labor or material.  O&M costs are combined and shown as a single cost.  Costs are also available via LIMS-EV VEHICLE VIEW. Average Cost Per Unit is Indicator #1 on PCN SB004-115  See rules 1 through 31, Attachment 6, for analysis procedures. Average cost Per Mile (Administrative Fleet) is Indicator #2 on PCN SB004-115   See rules 1 through 31, Attachment 6, for analysis procedures. Delayed Parts Received (Bin Location)(PCN SB004-062)  NMCM Hours to Direct Labor-Hours Percentage.    NMCM Hours or Direct Labor-Hour Ratio (Closed Work Orders) is Indicator #3 on PCN SB004-115  Monthly use this report with Materiel Control to jointly verify parts received and bin location of parts. A shop’s ability to respond to workload may be measured by use of this indicator.  It checks the percentage of direct productive labor-hours in relation to the number of NMCM hours on AF Forms 1823/-1.  The intent is to keep the spread of these two factors to a minimum. See rule 32, Attachment 6, for analysis procedures. Number of PM&Is Overdue is Indicator #5 on PCN SB004-115 See rules 66 through 71 of Attachment 6 for analysis procedures. Number of Work Orders Opened is Indicator #6 on PCN SB004-115 See rules 12 through 14 and 31 through 46 of Attachment 6 for analysis procedures. Number of Hours in Delay Code "C" is Indicator #7 on PCN SB004-115    See rules 61 through 52 of Attachment 6 for analysis procedures.  As a minimum, these shops will manually accumulate the total backlog hours and track, chart, or analyze at least two categories, hours with parts on hand 130 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 and other delayed hours.  Over a 12-month period, these shops should be able to develop an acceptable level of backlog hours, which will result in efficient shop management. Percent Direct Labor is Indicator #8 on PCN SB004-115   See rules 54 through 58 of Attachment 6 for analysis procedures. Percent Indirect Labor Productive is Indicator #9 on PCN SB004-115   See rule 59 of Attachment 6 for analysis procedures. Percent Indirect Labor Nonproductive is Indicator #10 on PCN SB004-115 See rule 60 of Attachment 6 for analysis procedures.  FM&A personnel will use rules 54 through 60 in Attachment 6 and the data in OLVIMS PCNs SB004-029 and SB004-032 to check on labor usage by work center. Percent of Fleet NMCM is Indicator #11 on PCN SB004-115   See rules 31 through 46 in Attachment 6 for analysis procedures. Percent of Fleet NMCS is Indicator #12 on PCN SB004-115   See rules 47 through 53 in Attachment 6 for analysis procedures. Percent of Fleet NMC is Indicator #13 on PCN SB004-115 See rules 31 through 53 in Attachment 6 for analysis procedures. Percent Hours NMC by Vehicle Group or Category is Indicators #14 through #22 on PCN SB004-115   Non-registered Vehicles and Equipment (USAF management codes that begin with a numeric character) Indicator #4 on PCN SB004-115  See rules 31 through 53 in Attachment 6 for analysis procedures. See rules 31 through 53 in Attachment 6 and the data in OLVIMS PCN SB004-008 or SB004-032 to see which vehicles or groups of vehicles have abnormal NMC rates. This indicator is longer valid and should be disregarded. 4.43.  Other Indicators.  There is a continuing need to check and measure motor vehicle related statistical and historical data beyond that outlined in this chapter.  There is almost no end to the material to be reviewed, just as there is no end to the need to improve customer service and save resources.  While some of the following areas may be used as part of any major analysis, they also lend  themselves  to  independent  tests  and  analyses.    In  some  way,  each  of  the  areas  affects  the outcome of the total vehicle management effort.  They are not listed in priority order, nor can any be singled out as being more important than the other.  The analyst must weigh each on a basis of what the goal is at a given time.  (T-1).  The remainder of this paragraph covers "other indicators" that will be monitored at the direction of 441 VSCOS and/or the VFM/VMS who will set goals to gauge the effectiveness of these indicators.  (T-1). 4.43.1.  Repeat Maintenance. This is often found to be one of the main causes of high costs and low MC rates. A high occurrence of repeat maintenance may indicate improper scheduling, inadequate quality control, failure to use test equipment to diagnose malfunctions or the need AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 131 for training. Use PCN SB004-032 - Part 10 to see which vehicles or equipment items are in and out of the shop too often. Also, see Rule 14 in Attachment 2 for analysis guidance. 4.43.2.  Contract Maintenance and Other Government Agency costs. By analyzing these costs, it  may  be  possible  to  identify  inadequate  manning,  skill  levels,  shop  layout,  tools  and equipment, and the extent to which in-house capabilities may be improved. It may be best to check these indicators in major vehicle categories. See PCN SB004-032 for the data to be used in this review. See rules 35 and 36 of Attachment 2 for analysis guidance. 4.44.  Other  Areas  to  Monitor.  The  following  areas  do  not  need  to  be  charted,  but  must  be checked by FM&A: 4.44.1.  Vehicle and Equipment Work Order Status.  Remove appropriate AF Forms 1823/-1 from the Work Order Master File Status Report (PCN SB004-018) on a timely basis.  (T-1).  Validate AF Forms 1823/-1 on the list 45 days or longer.  (T-1). 4.44.2.  Transient Vehicles.  Mail, fax or electronically transmit the vehicle repair transaction report  (PCN  SB004-019)  and  fuel  report  to  the  vehicle‘s  home  base  as  soon  as  they  are received.  (T-1). 4.45.  Controlling and Evaluating Problem Areas.  When unfavorable trends or indicators are present, FM&A will use Attachment 2 to identify problem areas and their causes and effects.  (T-1).  Attachment  2  also  reflects  suggested  review  procedures  and  preventive  measures.    When performing analysis, refrain from using inflation as a cause for increased cost-per-mile, the aging fleet for increased NMCM rates or other often used “crutches”. 4.45.1.  When investigating the cause of poor performance or when trying to isolate the prime reasons for a bad trend, try all the procedures listed in Attachment 2. 4.45.2.  All situations are not in Attachment 2; conditions that are command or base related may affect a situation in one case and may not in another. Section 4C—Reviewing Base Support and OPLANs with IDRC    4.46.  Interservice Vehicle Support.  Interservice support among DOD components will be used where economies can be realized without impairing mission effectiveness.  (T-1).  DoDI 4000.19, Support Agreements, 25 April 2013, implements policy concerning interservice support.  As a rule, the DOD component having the greater AOR (equipment and manpower) furnishes the support requested to the extent capabilities and military commitments permit.  (T-2). 4.47.  Arranging  for  Interservice  Vehicle  Support.  Arrangements  for  Interservice  support generally  provide  that  DOD  components  furnishing  the  service  will  not  assume  any  liability whatsoever for personal injury or property damage caused by any vehicle while it is in the custody of the using component.  The using DOD components must: 4.47.1.  Assume the cost of picking up and delivering vehicles.  (T-1). 4.47.2.  Properly operate, maintain and use vehicles in their custody.  (T-1). 4.47.3.  Take  administrative  action  relating  to  damage/theft  of  the  motor  vehicle  in  their custody.  (T-1). 132 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 4.47.4.  Assume responsibility for any damages resulting from accidents, abuses or incidents while the vehicle is in their possession.  (T-1). 4.48.  Activity Pooling.  A transportation and equipment (vehicle motor) pool: 4.48.1.  Operates  where  it  will  be  most  economical  or  provides  the  most  satisfactory transportation service. 4.48.2.  Pools full or partial transportation assets of separate activities.  The pool segments are located within an area most convenient to the majority of the vehicle users. 4.48.3.  Is administered by a lead activity designated by the components.  It may be subdivided locally as necessary.  Agreements for activity pooling are sent through channels to AF/A4LR for coordination.  (T-1). 4.49.  Establish,  Execute,  Initiate  and  Conduct  All  Vehicle  Recalls.  Incorporate  vehicle redistribution plans in the transportation annex to the basic plan as applicable. Section 4D—Vehicle Support Resulting From Terrorist Threats 4.50.  Overview.  Because of terrorist activities, the AF has a program to provide heavy and light armored vehicles, domicile-to-duty transportation, and vehicle painting and marking exceptions for threatened key personnel and senior officers.  AF Criminal Investigation & Counterintelligence (SAF/IGX) consolidates and validates all requests for these special vehicles or marking waivers in response to terrorist threats. 4.51.  Submission Procedures: 4.51.1.  The requesting MAJCOM, DRU or FOA Staffs submits all requests for special vehicle requirements to 441 VSCOS who will forward to SAF/IGX.  (T-0) 4.51.2.  SAF/IGX  validates  special  vehicle  requirements  based  on  terrorist  threats.    Once validated, SAF/IGX provides a recommendation to AF/A4L and A4P. 4.52.  Armored Vehicle Requirements. 4.52.1.  New  Armored  Vehicle  Procurement.    AF/A4PR  ensures  the  recommendation  is consistent with public law, EOs and DODDs and approves the recommendation.  Procurement, both  quantity  and  unit  cost,  must  be  authorized  by  Congress.    If  approved,  441  VSCOS allocates necessary 3080, BP8200 funds in applicable MBPAC funding line. 4.52.2.  Light  Armored  Vehicles.    441  VSCOS,  FOAs  or  DRUs  may  request  SAF/IGX approval  for  procuring  and  installing  approved  protection  on  existing  vehicles.    Submit requests when any of these conditions exist: 4.52.3.  The level of protection required makes the installation of armor on an existing vehicle more advantageous or economical. 4.52.4.  Agreements provide separate funding for vehicles and armor. 4.52.5.  Application of armor on an existing vehicle is the only method for obtaining armored vehicles. AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 133 Section 4E—VCP  4.53.

Turning In Vehicles to DLA-DS.  Policy and processes associated with turning in vehicles to  DLA-DS  are  covered is  available  at  http://www.dla.mil/DispositionServices.aspx. in  AFI  23-101.   Additional information 4.61.  Withdrawing Vehicles from DLA-DS. 4.61.1.  441 VSCOS must approve vehicles withdrawn from DLA-DS to be placed in the AF inventory.  (T-1).  Vehicle Management must certify a vehicle as economically repairable and warrants withdrawal action.  (T-1). 4.61.2.  Vehicles  previously  loaded  in  the  AF  inventory  can  be  withdrawn  for  use  in  AF training courses as a Vehicle Management training aid for non-over-the-road use with approval from 441 VSCOS.  Submit request through the LRS Equipment Liaison Office. 4.62.  Vehicle End-Of-Life (EOL) Determination. 4.62.1.  Vehicle EOL (when the vehicle should be retired and replaced with a new asset) is a calendar year (CY) value (e.g., 2012, 2013, etc).  Vehicle EOL values are available in LIMS-EV  Vehicle  View.    Click  “Status”  and  select  “Requirements”.    View  by  searching  on registration number or any other asset attributes.  The EOL model incorporated into LIMS-EV Vehicle View was designed using a similar methodology as used in civilian industry.  EOL model provides a more dynamic logic that includes flat line depreciation and sustainment costs.  Two  assets  purchased  in  the  same  procurement  year  could  have  different  EOL  values depending on sustainment costs for each vehicle. 4.62.2.  Methodology or Logic: 4.62.2.1.  The model uses the NSN, management code and standard price to depreciate a vehicle 15 percent each year over a 20-year period, based on the established depreciative value  of  the  prior  year.    For  vehicles  that  have  a  standard  price  over  $250,000,  the depreciated value will be 20 percent a year based on the established depreciative value of the prior year. 4.62.2.2.  The model uses previous year's O&M costs and increase by three percent each year  for  20  years.    Obtain  the  baseline  Operations  and  Maintenance  cost  data  from  the monthly VEA files by summing the following fields: Contract Maintenance Costs, Total Direct Labor, Total Parts Cost, Other Government Agency Cost, Contract Costs (Exclude any  figure over $50,000  because the depot  rebuild costs are used as  a part  of the direct maintenance costs will temporarily cause the life expectancy to decrease). Note:  If a year's worth of data is not available, then for estimating the annual direct operations and maintenance costs the model will use what is currently available.  4.62.2.3.  The EOL value will be determined when projected operations and maintenance costs exceed the depreciative value of the vehicle.  The actual estimated replacement year will be the year that the direct operations and maintenance costs exceed the depreciative value  of  the  vehicle.    Then  subtract  the  X  number  of  years  needed  for  budget  forecasts purposes. 138 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 4.62.2.4.  When viewing an asset EOL in LIMS-EV VV there are three values tied to the vehicle: “Replace Year”, “Calculated Replace Year” and “Calculated Life In Years”. 4.62.2.4.1.  Replace  Year  -  Indicates  the  CY  that  an  asset  may  be  funded  for replacement.    It  will  always  be  the  current  CY  or  out  years.    All  vehicles  that  have already  reached  EOL  but  continue  to  be  utilized  will  have  a  replace  year  equal  to current CY.  Any vehicle not at EOL will have a replace year equal to the calculated replace year. 4.62.2.4.2.  Calculated Replace Year - The CY year an asset reaches EOL.  This value will match “Replace Year” when the projected EOL value for the asset is equal to or beyond current CY. 4.62.2.4.3.  Calculated  Life  In  Years  -  The  expected  life  in  years  an  asset  will  be utilized and is dependent upon the acceptance year and EOL year. Note:  Refer to Attachment 5, Capability Based Funding and Vehicle Prioritization Model, for additional information. 4.63.  Interagency Motor Pools and Systems. 4.63.1.  IAW Title 40 United States Code Section 601, the Administrator of GSA has the actual responsibility  for  the  establishment  and  operation  of  interagency  motor  pools  and  systems.  GSA  develops  necessary  data  and  cost  statistics  to  determine  the  economic  feasibility  of establishing a motor pool in an area.

Vehicle Fleet Growth Policy.  The AF vehicle fleet represents a tremendous investment for the corporate AF.  The vehicle buy program provides funding for programmatic replacement of existing  assets,  but  is  not  funded  to  purchase  vehicles  for  new  requirements  (start-ups).    441 VSCOS must closely scrutinize any request to increase the size of the vehicle fleet.  Requests to increase  vehicle  fleet  size  must  be  supported  by  a  verifiable  mission  change,  e.g.,  OPLAN, Provisional Plan (PPLAN), etc.  (T-1).  The functional community requesting additional vehicle authorizations will fund the initial purchase of the vehicles, and advocate additional funding in the out-years of the Program Objective Memorandum (POM) for increased vehicle buy replacement dollars, or provide funding annually for leased assets.  (T-0).  Any non-mission change increase will  be  offset  by  adjustments  to  other  vehicle  authorizations  to  preclude  an  overall  increase  in authorizations.    Authorization  decreases  resulting  from  VVs  or  previous  mission  changes  (unit deactivation)  will  not  be  used  as  offsets.    All  adjustments  to  authorization  quantities  must  be approved by 441 VSCOS or other AF/A4LR designated enterprise management authority.  (T-0). 4.73.1.  Non-cataloged vehicle request.  Prior to requesting cataloging action, 441 VSCOS will consider  offsets,  current  authorizations  and  right  sizing  of  the  vehicle  requirement.    441 VSCOS  will  also  coordinate  with  the  appropriate  Item  Manager/Equipment  Specialist  to determine if there is an AF stock listed vehicle to satisfy the requirement.  If a requirement for cataloging  action  still  exists  after  completing  the  considerations  and  coordination  above, submit an AF Form 601 with item specifications and justification to 441 VSCOS.  (T-1).  441 VSCOS will review and submit approved requests to the AF AS Manager for cataloging action and AS inclusion. 4.74.  Major Program Codes, Major Mission Types and Definitions.

Ensure vehicles and vehicular equipment designated for shipment are in the condition reflected in the LTI that shipment is approved by 441 VSCOS.  Local Traffic Management Flight will assist with guidance on funding the transportation costs associated with an RDO as provided in AFI 24-203, Chapter 7.  (T-1).  Ensure the agency directing the vehicle shipment  provides complete fund citation information or written approval from  the appropriate transportation  account  code  (TAC)  manager  for  use  of  the  TAC  to  charge  shipping  costs.  The VFM/VMS  certifies  on  an  AFTO  Form  91  that  the  vehicle  being  shipped  is  still  in  the  same condition as reflected on the approved LTI. 4.79.  First  Article  Testing  (FAT).  FAT  ensures  that  a  contractor  can  furnish  a  product  that conforms to all PWS requirements for acceptance.  Refer to FAR Subpart 9.3, First Article Testing and  Approval,  current  edition,  and  AFMCI  64-110,  First  Article  Management,  for  further information. 4.79.1.  When required, a PWS will state that the vendor/contractors must develop at least one first article vehicle for full testing.  (T-0).  Commands or end-users may observe and participate in  these  tests.    441  VSCOS  will  observe  and  participate  in  tests;  as  well  as  provide  liaison between command or end-user and Robins AFB SE&V in this effort.  (T-1). Note:  For base maintenance/construction and fire protection vehicles, AFCEC will observe and/or participate in first article testing with 441 VSCOS and the lead command. 4.79.2.  Test Parameters.  When specified by the PWS, contractors define the test parameters for in-plant FAT.  When possible, Robins AFB SE&V provides a copy of  the parameters to the lead command 15 days prior to the test.  Robins AFB SE&V can address questions about the test parameters. 4.79.3.  Test Procedures.  For tests  in  the factory, the manufacturer normally accomplishes the tests and the Defense Contract Administration Service (DCAS) monitors those tests. 4.79.3.1.  Robins AFB SE&V can require a second first article vehicle.  Lead commands may  assist  in  making  that  decision.    Request  a  second  prototype  at  the  same  time  the specification review response is made.  The lead commands provide recommended user  test  parameters  and  pass  or  fail  criteria.    Send  the  second  prototype  to  the  AF  base designated by Robins AFB SE&V and the lead command. 4.79.3.2.  AF personnel and the manufacturer conduct tests at a base.  The lead command ensures the primary users of the vehicle participate in the tests. 4.79.3.3.  The lead command forwards a report of the test results to Robins AFB SE&V 15 days after the test is complete. 4.79.3.4.  Robins AFB SE&V makes the final decision on specifications, revisions, user test parameters and “pass/fail” criteria. AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 151 4.79.4.  Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E).

The  lead command and the Vehicle System Program Manager coordinate the use of OT&E on vehicle types within six weeks after the Annual Buy Budget Review. 4.80.  Furnishing  Government  Equipment–Vehicles.  Contractors  are  normally  required  to furnish  all  property  necessary  to  perform  Government  contracts,  this  includes  Government Furnished  Equipment–Vehicles  (GFV).    Requesting  activities  and  Contracting  Officers  must obtain 441 VSCOS approval prior to including any government-owned vehicles as GFP in a PWS or contract.  (T-1). 4.80.1.  If  GFV  is  approved  by  441  VSCOS,  assets  will  only  be  loaded  in  the  vehicle accountable system under one of the following GFV AS Codes: 4.80.1.1.  AS032:    Vehicle  Fleet  (AF  provided  and  replaced  contractor  support).    These vehicles are provided as “Agency-Peculiar” GFP (with Special Allowance Flag “X”) and the AF is responsible for providing replacements.  Agency-Peculiar GFV are vehicles that are  not  available  on  the  open-market  and  specifically  required  to  support  or  complete  a contract task; e.g., 60/25K Aircraft Cargo Loaders, R-11 Aircraft Refuelers, MB-2/MB-4 Aircraft  Tow  Vehicles  or  Flight-Line  Tow  Tractor  (when  AF  Technical  Orders  call  for specific tow vehicles types), M-Series and any other Mil Spec vehicle. Note:  Refer to Table 4.2 for AS Code descriptions. 4.80.2.  If GFV use is approved, but assets are not available, the functional activity requesting GFVs  submits  requests  new  authorizations  from  441  VSCOS,  through  servicing  Vehicle  Management  activity.    Request  must  include  procurement  funding  (fund  code  573080), sourced by the requesting activity.  Once authorization is established and funding provided, 441 VSCOS will coordinate procurement with Robins AFB SE&V.  (T-0). 4.80.2.1.  GFP vehicles with residual value may be offered/transferred as GFP vehicles on subsequent  contracts  at  the  same  location.    Current  GFP  available  for  transfer  to  the contractor  will  be  included  in  the  PWS.    At  a  minimum,  the  list  will  include:  vehicle make/model, VIN, and AF registration number.  A memorandum stating the GFV will be available prior to or on the contract start date is to accompany the PWS.  (T-1). 4.80.2.2.  Use  of  AF  O&M  funds  (573400)  to  procure  vehicles  is  strictly  prohibited.

(T-1). 4.80.8.  The contractor will determine if AS051 GFV has reach end-of-life and is no longer cost  effective  to  maintain  based  on  industry  standards  and/or  best-business  practices.  However, the contractor will not be bound to purchase a replacement vehicle if the contractor deems it unnecessary.  Contractors have the option to lease or rent vehicles/equipment at their own expense. 4.80.8.1.  The Government  procurement process  will not  be used to  purchase contractor owned replacement vehicles for contractors.  (T-0). 4.80.9.  AS037 “Agency Peculiar” GFP will be managed and maintained IAW this AFI, TO 36-1-191 and other applicable TOs or directives. 4.80.10.  The  AF  maintains  fiduciary  responsibility  over  GFP.    The  “equipment”  assets  are managed within AFEMS; guidance and procedures are located in AFI 23-101.  The APSR for GFM assets is the Stock Control System and procedures are located in AFI 23-101.  Additional policy is contained in AFI 23-119. 4.80.11.  The  installation  Contracting  Officer,  COR  or  designee,  will  coordinate  with  the servicing Vehicle Management activity concerning disposal of GFP vehicle assets.  (T-1).  The servicing Vehicle Management activity will request disposition instruction from 441 VSCOS using standard procedures.  (T-1). 4.80.12.  Contractor-acquired property (CAP) vehicles are acquired or provided by a contractor for  performing  a  contract,  and  to  which  the  Government  has  title,  if  the  CAP  vehicle  is specified as a deliverable on the PWS/Contract. AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 153 4.80.12.1.  Authorizations  must  be  approved  prior  to  procurement.    (T-1).    If  vehicle authorization is not approved, the AF will not accept vesting of title, provide accountability and/or accept responsibility to support/sustain or dispose of the asset(s). 4.80.13.  Vehicles  owned  or  provided  by  the  contractor  are  not  subject  to  the  management policies contained in this instruction.  In very rare instances, Vehicle Management may provide maintenance support on a reimbursable basis only, if approved by 441 VSCOS. 4.80.14.  If the Most Efficient Organization (MEO) is the successful bidder, assets will revert to the original authorizations under the respective AF AS.  However, there is potential for 441 VSCOS to direct reductions based on MEO bid proposals. 4.81.  Vehicle Fleet  Parking.  The following paragraphs establish AF policy regarding parking serviceable/unserviceable  vehicles  to  mitigate  sustainment  funding  issues  that  affect  mission capabilities. 4.81.1.

Materiel Control provides support to Vehicle Management using the ILS-S, COPARS or other decentralized purchasing methods.  Materiel Control manages ILS-S transactions for Vehicle Management. 5.1.1.1.  COPARS is a DoD approved method of supplementing ILS-S and for attaining commercially available automotive parts.  COPARS reduces research, item identification times  and  costs  for  parts  that  are  not  stock  listed  or  cataloged.    Ideally  located  next  to COPARS, it is important that Materiel Control personnel have regular interaction with the contractor throughout each duty day.  The nature of this relationship is indicative of the importance that all Materiel Control personnel read, know the terms of the contract. 5.1.1.2.  Decentralized  purchasing  methods,  such  as  a  BPA  or  GPC,  may  be  more appropriate for some Vehicle Management activities than methods such as COPARS.  The Contracting Officer is the primary source for information and advice on COPARS, BPAs and GPC provisions. 5.1.1.2.1.  .    BPAs  for  parts  purchases  are  individual  contracts  with  parts  suppliers.  Contracting  negotiates  for  authorized  items  and  discounts,  and  provides  overall surveillance  of  the  BPA.    Vehicle  Management  provides  funds  and  manpower  to identify,  order  requirements  and  document  part  procurement/purchase  activity  for internal purposes. Vehicle Management may provide funds; however, they do not have authority to purchase (unless it is by GPC) nor do they document contract activities. 5.1.1.2.2.  .    GPC  is  a  credit  card  used  for  purchasing  parts  and  services  within  the parameters of the program.   Contracting approves its use, trains  both  the cardholder and  approving  official  and  manages  the  program.    Vehicle  Management  nominates cardholder(s) who become Purchasing Agent(s), and are responsible for identifying and buying only authorized items, negotiating discounts and documenting GPC purchases. 5.1.1.3.  PACAF  Vehicle  Management  activities  are  authorized  to  use  the  Vehicle  Parts Supply  Organization  (VPSO)  located  at  the  673D  LRS  JBER  Alaska  to  obtain  needed repair parts, tools and equipment and contract repairs that are not immediately available locally.    The  VPSO  will  not  be  used  for  the  purchase  of  administrative,  janitorial,  or housekeeping supplies.  (T-1).  Organizations wishing to use VPSO will contact the 673D LRS VPSO by e-mail at 673lrs.vpso@us.af.mil to establish a VPSO account.  The VPSO will establish a separate Air Force Wide Government Purchase Card (GPC) account for each PACAF organization using VPSO.  (T-1).  The VPSO may also establish a separate base supply organization code with the FB5000 base supply account at JBER.  Funds from using  organizations  AF  Form  616,  Fund  Cite  Authorization,  may  be  transferred  to  the Organization Project Fund Management Record (PFMR) to fund base supply transactions.  The  VPSO  will  provide  a  quarterly  transaction  report  to  441  VSCOS  and  HQ 158 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 PACAF/A4REV containing the number of purchases, total funds expended and number of shipments made during the quarter for each organization using VPSO.  (T-1). 5.1.1.4.  GPC is a credit card used for purchasing parts and services within the parameters of the program.  Contracting approves its use, trains the cardholder, approving official and manages  the  program.    Vehicle  Management  nominates  cardholder(s)  who  become Purchasing Agent(s), and are responsible for identifying and buying only authorized items, negotiating discounts and documenting GPC purchases. 5.1.2.  Materiel Control is not a unit supply function.  The VFM/VMS ensures supply functions unrelated to Vehicle Management needs are not given to Materiel Control. 5.1.3.  Manpower for Materiel Control is limited. 5.1.4.  The management personnel supervising Materiel Control may not have much exposure to supply procedures, but they must have a basic understanding of the job to properly supervise personnel,  evaluate  supply  support  and  make  knowledgeable  performance  ratings.    LRS Customer Support Liaison Element provides customer training IAW AFI 23-101, Air Force Materiel Management, to fulfill part of this requirement.  Where this training leaves off, this chapter  explains  supply  terms  and  complicated  procedures  in  language  familiar  to  the maintenance worker. 5.1.5.  The  scope  of  Materiel  Control  operations  requires  additional  emphasis  on  training, because these specialists must maintain proficiency in the supply career field as well as develop a basic understanding of maintenance. 5.1.5.1.  The VFM/VMS ensures Materiel Control personnel become fully qualified in all aspects  of  the  operation,  including  the  use  of  ILS-S,  OLVIMS,  Green  Procurement, COPARS procedures and all management products. 5.1.5.2.  A  qualification  training  program  is  set  up  for  all  newly  assigned  personnel  to ensure they receive proficiency training as soon as possible. 5.1.6.  The concepts and procedures outlined here ensure compatibility with AFI 23-101 and AFCSM 24-1. 5.1.7.  Overseas commands are authorized to establish requirements contracts for procurement of parts and supplies to support foreign buy vehicles.  Overseas units develop procedures for the  effective  security,  control,  documentation  and  issue  of  parts  purchased  through  BPAs.  Authority to bypass the stock fund is provided in AFI 23-101. Section 5B—Specific Guidance  5.2.  Materiel Control Responsibilities. 5.2.1.

Various reports and listings are available from the ILS-S and ALC supply systems for managing supply support for the shop.  Some of these reports are sent automatically;  others  are  sent  based  on  local  needs.    All  reports  are  listed  in  AFMAN  23-122, Material Management Procedures, for all bases including any ALC counterparts.  All reports will be neatly bound in order  so that they may be easily used.  The following paragraphs describe the basic uses of the most significant reports and listings AFMAN 23-122: 5.5.1.  The Daily Document Register (D04) is made in document number sequence and is a comprehensive  review  of  the  previous  day‘s  supply  transactions.    It  shows  exceptional transactions that may require analysis; answers questions about supply that the shop may have and  points  out  possible  abuses  of  the  supply  system.    It  will  be  checked  each  duty  day  for issues, due-out releases and cancellation information.  (T-1). 5.5.2.  The  Priority  Monitor  Report  (D18)  is  reviewed  each  duty  day  for  Urgency  of  Need Designator (UND) "A" requirements and weekly for UND "B" requirements.  (The weekly and monthly  reports  exclude  bench  stock,  equipment  and  supply  point  requirements).    It  lists outstanding due-outs for each item.  It is used to validate all back ordered parts for delayed AF Forms 1823/-1. 5.5.3.  The AWP Validation Listing (D19) shows the required information to manage DIFM assets, to maintain a current inventory of DIFM items and to reconcile DIFM balances. 5.5.4.  The Supply Point Listing (Q13) lists all items authorized, on hand and due out to the supply point.  It also has summary data on shortages, excesses and identification of buildup items. 5.5.5.  The Organization Bench Stock Listing (SO4) lists all bench stock items for each activity that applies.  It can be used to find items in the bench stock, to check bench stock authorizations and to add new bench stock items.  This listing is shown in NSN and item number sequence. 5.5.6.  The Due-out Validation (M30) provides data for review of UND "A" and "B" priority due-outs.  It is also a managerial tool for validating all UND "C" due-outs monthly (except equipment, which is validated at least quarterly). 5.5.7.  The  Stock  Number  Directory  (M14),  or  Stock  Number  User  Directory  (SNUD),  is  a monthly list of all NSNs stored in the ILS-S.  It tells whether an item has been loaded in the computer as well as data about the item (unit price, unit of issue, source of supply and so forth).  Due to its volume, this directory is not sent automatically and only a small number of copies are made.  Contact the Management Systems Flight for a copy of the previous month‘s list. AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 163 5.6.  Supply Discipline.  Supply discipline is essential to good materiel management and applies to all personnel.  Responsibilities are identified in AFI 23-101, Air Force Materiel Management. 5.6.1.  A reparable is as important as a serviceable item, since the reparable may be the only source of supply.  ILS-S considers a DIFM detail as a potentially serviceable asset and will print an I023 Asset Management notice on an issue request.  Reparable assets removed from the  end  item  must  be  promptly  sent  through  repair  channels  and  controlled  throughout  the repair  cycle.    Local  vendors  and  COPARS  often  require  a  reparable  item  (core)  before  a serviceable one is sold. 5.6.2.  Double ordering from any source wastes funds, reduces credibility and does not serve the shop well.  Do not use such practices. 5.7.  Priority System.  There are five main terms that all Materiel Control personnel will know: 5.7.1.  Force Activity Designator (FAD).  Each organization is assigned a FAD (1 through 5) by  the  JCS  through  the  USAF  Program  Document.    The  organizational  FAD  indicates  the relative priority of a unit.  The FAD code is loaded in the ILS-S and will be loaded in OLVIMS.  Vehicle  Management,  as  a  support  unit,  is  rarely  assigned  a  FAD  as  high  as  many  of  the vehicles it works on (such as flight line vehicles, fire trucks, etc.).  In these cases the FAD of the mission supported by the vehicle will be used to order the parts needed for maintenance.  (T-1). 5.7.1.1.  Review FAD codes annually, update as required.  (T-1). 5.7.2.  Urgency of Need Designator (UND).  The UND is a one-character alpha code, used to indicate the urgency of the need.  There are three primary UNDs: A, B and C. 5.7.2.1.  UND "A" means a lack of the requested item prevents mission accomplishment. 5.7.2.2.  UND "B" means lack of the item impairs mission accomplishment. 5.7.2.3.  UND "C" is used for routine needs not meeting the criteria for a higher UND. 5.7.2.4.  “1” is  a fourth UND used to indicate a verified NMCS condition for a MICAP reportable vehicle. 5.7.3.  Urgency  Justification  Code  (UJC).    The  UJC  is  a  two-character  code  that  shows  the priority and use of the required part (see AFMAN 23-122).  The first character of the UJC is the UND; the second character is an alpha code assigned to the type of equipment being worked on.  In the case of vehicles, the assigned code is "F" or "Q”.  When requesting most parts from the LRS Customer Service, Materiel Control uses UJC 1F, AF or BF. 5.7.4.  Base Delivery Priority.  A local delivery priority is  assigned by  Materiel Control for each demand placed in ILS-S.  The delivery priorities are in AFI 24-301, Vehicle Operations. 5.7.5.  Requisition Priority.  The requisition priority is assigned by the ILS-S computer based on a combination of the FAD code of the requesting organization (or the supported vehicle, if FAD override is used) and the UND code.  When the property is not available in LRS supply system for immediate issue, this priority tells the source of supply the level of urgency. 5.8.  Materiel Control and OLVIMS Coordination.  Materiel Control has a key role in ensuring all materiel costs are properly charged in OLVIMS. 164 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 5.8.1.  This  part  of  the  AFI  integrates  Materiel  Control’s  procedural  responsibilities  for OLVIMS with its other responsibilities.  AFCSM 24-1 gives further procedures for expenditure data input and output using OLVIMS (see Figure 5.1., Materiel Control & OLVIMS Cross-Reference Listing). 5.8.2.  Materiel  Control  personnel  must  know  all  aspects  of  the  materiel  costing  process.  FM&A is the focal point for OLVIMS and is the main source of information and training for new personnel.  In addition, FM&A is the POC for keeping all personnel informed of system changes.  The information in Figure 5.1 below is provided for a quick reference of OLVIMS formats and listings used by Materiel Control.  All references are from AFCSM 24-1. Figure 5.1.  Materiel Control & OLVIMS Cross-Reference Listing.  5.8.3.  Materiel  costs  for  purchases  are  inputted  in  OLVIMS.    Items  are  charged  in  three different ways; to the: 5.8.3.1.  Vehicle on which the item is used. 5.8.3.2.  "High-Cost Bench Stock" account (work order number H8888), for items of bench stock or working stock costing $60 or more per unit.  Do not charge these items to a specific vehicle until the parts are installed. 5.8.3.3.  "Low-Cost Bench Stock" account (work order number L9999), for items with a unit of use cost of less than $60.  These costs are charged as overhead against the entire fleet, rather than to a specific vehicle. 5.8.4.  Items are further identified by charge codes for maintenance or non-chargeable costs (“D”, ”M” or “N”).  The requester assigns these codes and Materiel Control verifies them.  For examples of items to be charged to these codes see AFCSM 24-1, Attachment 4. 5.9.  Adjusted Stock Levels.  Adjusted levels provide a means to change base stock levels and are used when usage experience is not the best predictor of future needs.  When wisely used, adjusted levels are a valuable tool in supporting the mission.  Because AF resources are limited, the approval of an adjusted level frequently means that fewer dollars are available to buy items with established consumption rates.  Requests for adjusted levels must be carefully considered.  Procedures are in AFMAN 23-122. 5.9.1.  Requests for adjusted levels are sent to the LRS Customer Support Section on an AF Form  1996.    This  form  is  used  to  request  a  change  to  stocked  levels,  not  to  bench  stock minimum reserve levels. 5.9.2.  Materiel Control initiates the AF Form 1996 in five copies, with help from the requester.  The VFM/VMS signs as the approving authority. AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 165 5.9.3.  One  copy  of  the  AF  Form  1996  is  held  in  a  suspense  file,  three  copies  are  sent  to Customer Support Section and one is sent to the requester. 5.9.4.  Initiate follow-up actions if Materiel Control is not notified within 10 days for items that  require  base-level  approval  or  45  days  for  items  that  require  IM  approval.    When notification is received, inform the requester, remove the copy from the suspense file and file the approved AF Form 1996. 5.9.4.1.  Approved  requests  are  filed  in  Materiel  Control  to  use  during  adjusted  level reviews. 5.9.4.2.  Rejected requests are reviewed with the requester to see whether more action is needed. Section 5C—Issue Procedures  5.10.  General  Information.  This  section  discusses  procedures  used  in  obtaining  off-the-shelf parts from  LRS.  To be effective, Materiel Control  personnel  must know the procedures of the supply system they work with (ILS-S, GPC, COPARS or BPAs).  These procedures supplement supply  procedures,  and  generally  apply  to  requesting  parts  for  NMCS  and  delayed  AF  Forms 1823/-1.    The  LRS  Customer  Service  &  Training  Section  gives  supply  system  training  when requested.  AFMAN 23-122 outlines detailed procedures used in issue requests. 5.11.  Identifying the Requirement. 5.11.1.  This section discusses guidelines for determining the source of supply and describes the procedures to use.  This is one of the most critical aspects of materiel support for the shop.  Attention to detail in this process goes a long way in ensuring that the right part is ordered the first time. 5.11.2.  The technician helps Materiel Control determine the following information about the item: 5.11.2.1.  NSN, part numbers and associated manufacturer’s codes. 5.11.2.2.  Nomenclature. 5.11.2.3.  Quantity. 5.11.2.4.  TO, figure and index. 5.11.2.5.  UND 5.11.2.6.  FAD from the AF Form 1823/-1. 5.11.2.7.  Management code. 5.11.2.8.  Make and model of vehicle. 5.11.2.9.  Source code, when available.  Check the format of the TO; if no code is available or item is coded Local Purchase (LP), COPARS or other sources may be used. 5.11.2.10.  VIN. 5.12.  Requests Sent Through LRS Demand Processing. 166 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 5.12.1.  Document all parts requested through LRS Demand Processing Section by one of three methods: 5.12.1.1.  Initiate  AF  Form  2005,  Issue/Turn-In  Request,  according  to  AFMAN  23-122.  Give Demand Processing the original  and one copy.   Hold a copy in  suspense until  the transaction  appears  on  the  D04,  D22  (with  OLVIMS  transaction)  and  the  property  is received.  If the transaction fails to appear on the D04 the next computer processing day, follow up with demand processing to find out the status of the transaction. 5.12.1.2.  Log  all  parts  requested  on  AF  Form  2413,  Supply  Control  Log.    Column  G contains the work order number and Column N (Mark For) contains the vehicle registration number.  Once property is received, highlight the entire entry.  Items not highlighted are deemed active requests. 5.12.1.3.  Use a locally created database to track part ordering.  Procedures are the same as AF Form 2413 in the preceding paragraph. 5.12.2.  Several  actions  take  place  when  an  item  is  issued  from  LRS  Demand  Processing Section: 5.12.2.1.  The  part  is  delivered  along  with  a  DD  Form  1348-1A.    The  part  is  checked against  the  “suspense”  AF  Form  2005,  supply  control  log  entry  or  locally  developed database to ensure the correct item was received.  Clearly annotate the AF Form 2005, AF Form 2413 or locally developed database to show receipt of property. 5.12.2.2.  Using the D04, verify receipt of all issues and due-out releases.  Initiate follow-up actions on any property not received by the next duty day. 5.12.2.3.  Using the D22, verify the following fields prior to uploading into OLVIMS and forwarding to FM&A: 5.12.2.3.1.  Compatibility  of  charge  code  and  item  (example:  A  tire  Federal  Supply Class 2610 with a charge code 0 is incorrect). 5.12.2.3.2.  Validity  of  work  order  number  (example:  Real  work  order  number  is B1234 but shows F1234; L9999 or H8888 improperly used). 5.12.2.3.3.  Suspected unit of issue or extended cost errors. 5.12.2.3.4.  Verification of the cost on issues of $500 or more. 5.12.2.4.  To clear the AF Form 2005 issue suspense, supply control log suspense entry or locally  developed  database  entry,  Materiel  Control  must  receive  both  the  OLVIMS transaction and the item. 5.12.2.5.  Useful data on the D22 listing includes: 5.12.2.5.1.  Heading "CC.”  On an issue, an "R" or "N”, if present shows the demand code; on a turn-in, the coded entry indicates the action taken. 5.12.2.5.2.  Heading "UJC.”  This column is blank for off-the-shelf issues; the urgency of need code is shown for all delayed and NMCS issues. 5.12.2.5.3.  Heading  "RVP.”    This  column  contains  an  "R"  when  a  transaction  was reversed out of the SBSS. AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 167 5.12.2.6.  FM&A inputs the “VZ” transaction into OLVIMS.  This transaction charges or reverses costs for items received from or turned in to the LRS Demand Processing Section.  All transactions are shown on PCN SB 004-005.  Those that pass all edits (see AFCSM 24-1) reflect an Input Record Accepted (IRA) status on the right hand side of the list under column "RCDS-1”.  If there are any errors shown by the system, an "IRE" appears in the columns, as well as an asterisk () to the right of the field in error.  FM&A can correct any error shown for these transactions. 5.12.2.7.  441  VSCOS  may  authorize  alternative  methods  to  check  on  the  receipt  of OLVIMS materiel costing transactions and property. 5.13.  Requests Submitted Through COPARS.  A valid AF Form 1823/-1 or work order number is required to submit request and receive items from COPARS.  Organizations other than the LRS will use their appropriate document to purchase parts from COPARS.  (T-1). 5.14.  Requests  Submitted  Through  BPA  or  GPC.  The  sales  slip  or  invoice  is  the  source document for updating OLVIMS.  After screening the sales slip or invoice for correct pricing and warranty  information,  Materiel  Control  forwards  it  to  FM&A  for  the  transaction  input  into OLVIMS.  A separate "PZ" transaction is input for each item (except L9999 or H8888) and can be found on PCN SB004-005. Section 5D—Vehicle NMCS Processing  5.15.  General Information.  When the required parts are not available the vehicle is designated as  NMCS.    AFI  23-106,  Assignment  and  Use  of  Standard  Reporting  Designators,  provides justification  and  guidance  for  the  use  of  Standard  Reporting  Designators  (SURD).    A  NMCS condition starts extraordinary supply action by Materiel Control. Track NMCS-reportable vehicles by the MICAP reporting system (if applicable) and the depot IM until the need has been met.  This section describes the procedures Materiel Control uses in handling NMCS conditions.  MICAP reportable  vehicles  are  found  in  the  Standard  Reporting  Designator  (SRD)  list  in  Integrated Maintenance Data Systems (IMDS) and Supply Systems.  A quick-reference list is provided in the VM Neighborhood.  Non-MICAP requisitions coded with a NMCS and AF UJC are authorized to  include  a  “777”  RDD.    The  “777”  identifies  the  item  for  fast  transportation  (AFH23-123V2PT2).    Materiel  Control  personnel  will  ensure  the  judicious  use  of  this  code.    The VFM/VMS  will  ensure  appropriate  emphasis  is  placed  on  parts  procurement  priorities  by periodically verifying compliance as necessary to meet mission requirements.  (T-1). 5.16.  NMCS Verification Procedures.  Prompt, responsive verification is the key to preventing unwarranted NMCS conditions, cannibalizations, priority system abuses and unnecessary funds abuse. 5.16.1.  Order UND "A" and "B" requests on a "Fill or Kill" basis, except AWP requests. 5.16.1.1.  When assets are not available to fill the request, a "Kill" action takes place and the computer prints an I023 Other Assets Management Notice. 5.16.1.2.  Information  on the  I023 includes:  DIFM details,  supply point  details  with  on-hand balances, substitute NSNs with the requested Interchangeable Substitute Group (ISG) with serviceable balances, percent base repair and whether the item is on a bench stock. 5.16.1.3.  Materiel Control immediately verifies the need. 168 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 5.16.2.  Verification of requirements includes the following steps: 5.16.2.1.  Materiel  Control  researches  part  numbers,  TO  figure  and  index,  next  higher assembly or bits and pieces, usable-on-codes, quantity per assembly and source codes. 5.16.2.2.  The verifier checks availability of bench stock assets.  If none are available, but a substitute item is, the verifier contacts the requester to find out whether it is suitable.  If the substitute is suitable, Materiel Control makes the necessary arrangements with the shop with the bench stock. 5.16.2.3.  If DIFM assets are available, coordinate with the shop work center to expedite repair and return of the reparable to satisfy the request in time to meet the need.  Materiel Control does not verify a repair cycle item as NMCS until it is found that an item cannot be fixed locally. 5.16.2.4.  Research the next higher assembly, find out its availability and suitability. 5.16.2.5.  Check the delayed part bins for needed item.  Use the PCN SB004-016, “Delayed Parts Received”, as an aid to find whether other vehicles of the same type have delayed parts  on  hand.    If  so,  complete  an  AF  Form  1832,  Record  of  Cannibalization  (Vehicle Maintenance), transferring the parts from the delayed AF Form 1823/-1 to a NMCS AF Form 1823/-1.  Send the AF Form 1823/-1 to FM&A where an "SW" transaction is made to charge the materiel cost from the delayed record to the open NMCS AF Form 1823/-1.  Materiel Control submits the parts request for the delayed part, using the delayed AF Form 1823/-1‘s number.  The delayed AF Form 1823/-1  is then marked accordingly. 5.16.2.6.  If the above actions have still not met the need, consider locally manufacturing the part within the shop.  If there is no internal capability to do this, find out whether the capability  exists  elsewhere  on  base.    If  a  base  shop  is  found  that  can  fabricate  the  part, contact Demand Processing Section and send the request as outlined in AFI 23-101. 5.16.2.7.  If a new part cannot be obtained, a serviceable used part can be purchased under a separate contract on a one-time basis. 5.16.2.8.  Notify requester to determine further actions on UND “B” requests. 5.16.2.9.  If a part is not available for a UND "A" need, the verifier tells the work center supervisor or FM&A Workload Controller to verify that a NMCS condition exists.  At this time, the VFM/VMS decides whether to cannibalize or to confirm an NMCS condition.  If the VFM/VMS decides the latter, put the start time on the AF Form 1823/-1. 5.17.  MICAP and NMCS (AF Requisitions). 5.17.1.  Items backordered for a MICAP or NMCS condition (UJC 1F/AF) are shown on the D18.  Review the report when received to ensure the supply system is acting on the request.  Materiel Control verifies the following data: 5.17.1.1.  NSN. 5.17.1.2.  Quantity. 5.17.1.3.  Vehicle registration number. 5.17.1.4.  SRD.    SRDs  that  apply  to  vehicles  are  in  the  IMDS  and  Supply  Systems  for query. AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 169 Note:   PCN  SG054-84S,  Standard  Reporting  Designator  Codes,  lists  all  SRDs.  An extract from this report of commonly used vehicle and equipment MICAP Reportable SRDs are provided in the VM Neighborhood.  If the NMCS part does not appear or does not have a due in  date  the  day  after  the  need  has  been  levied,  ILS-S will  be  contacted  to  find  the cause and correct it.  (T-1). 5.17.2.  D18.  Status can be identified on the report within a given number of days, based on Military Standard Requisition and Issue Procedures (MILSTRIP) priority (see AFMAN 23-122 for more details.) 5.17.3.  This status is posted to a status board or automated equivalent, and updated as changes occur.  The NMCS status board or automated equivalent, has the following minimum data and must be readily available in the Materiel Control work center: 5.17.3.1.  Type of vehicle. 5.17.3.2.  Vehicle registration number. 5.17.3.3.  NSN or part number. 5.17.3.4.  Nomenclature. 5.17.3.5.  Quantity and unit of issue. 5.17.3.6.  Due-out document number. 5.17.3.7.  MICAP  (1F)  or  NMCS  (AF)  backorder  date  (a  color  code  may  be  used  to differentiate between MICAP and NMCS). 5.17.3.8.  Current status. 5.17.3.9.  Source of supply. 5.17.4.  The VFM/VMS makes a policy on which MICAP and NMCS conditions they want briefed on and how often.  Also set up a general procedure as to what is unsatisfactory status, thus  requiring  more  action.    Overseas  bases  supported  by  the  Commercial  Administrative Vehicle Repair Parts Program, under Project Code JZO, JCM and JZC,  review status policies as  outlined  in  AFI  23-101  before  making  this  determination.    IAW  with  these  procedures, Materiel Control will keep key management personnel informed on NMCS status and provide follow-up supply assistance or supply difficulty action with ILS-S, as the case dictates.  The Materiel Control supervisor ensures that follow-up management actions are tailored to specific shop needs rather than a system of arbitrary follow up.  (T-1). 5.18.  Supply Assistance and Difficulty. 5.18.1.  Materiel Control will submit follow-up, supply assistance or supply difficulty action when  bad  status  is  received  from  the  depot.    Materiel  Control  will  never  allow  ineffective supply support to be traced to a lack of aggressive follow up on its part. 5.18.2.  AFI 23-101, outlines the procedures for follow-up on established due-outs and sending supply difficulty reports. 5.18.3.  Materiel Control maintains a copy of each request for supply assistance or difficulty with the appropriate MICAP, NMCS or delayed requisition. 5.19.  NMCS Requirements through GPC, BPA, VPSO or COPARS. 170 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 5.19.1.  View  items  in  this  category  similarly  to  those  requested  through  ILS-S.    Materiel Control must contact the vendor/procurement source each duty day for current status.  (T-1). 5.19.2.  Annotate  MICAP  and  NMCS  items  ordered  through  BPA,  GPC  or  VPSO  with  the correct data on the NMCS status board or automated equivalent. 5.20.  Receipt of NMCS Parts. 5.20.1.  Materiel Control immediately informs the FM&A Workload Controller when a NMCS part is received so it may be scheduled for work.  (T-1).  The parts are binned and the AF Form 1823/-1 or parts ordering form marked accordingly.  Mark the suspense copy of AF Form 2005 or the line entry in the supply control log to show that the part is received. 5.20.2.  An  OLVIMS  transaction  should  be  received  the  day  following  the  due-out  release.  After verification against the data on the suspense slip, or line entry, on AF Form 2413, the OLVIMS  transaction  is  sent  to  FM&A  and  the  AF  Form  2005  will  be  destroyed.    The suspended entry on the control log clearly shows that both the OLVIMS transaction and the part have been received. 5.20.3.  All  parts  received  are  binned  and  documented  on  the  AF  Form  1823/-1.    The  sales receipt or invoice is reviewed for accuracy.  The AF Form 1823/-1 and sales receipt or invoice is forwarded to FM&A for input into OLVIMS and scheduling of the repair. Section 5E—Managing AF Forms 1823/-1 Delayed for Parts  5.21.  Importance of Delayed AF Forms 1823/-1.  When a lack of parts does not cause a NMCS condition, a delayed-for-parts AF Form 1823/-1 is initiated and the vehicle is returned to the user.  Delayed parts management is the heart of supply support for the preventive maintenance program.  The importance of this function grows as vehicles get older.  Although delayed parts have a lower priority than NMCS, they need special attention by Materiel Control to ensure that positive action is taken for each request. 5.22.  Delayed Work Order Folders. 5.22.1.  When an AF Form 1823/-1 has been delayed for parts, the FM&A workload controller makes a new AF Form 1823/-1 with all the required information, and sends a copy of the AF Form 1823/-1 and the parts request to Materiel Control for processing.  All parts backordered through ILS-S are marked on AF Form 2005 or the supply control log. 5.22.2.  VFM/VMS determines filing sequence of delayed AF Forms 1823/-1 folders. 5.23.  Monitoring Delayed Work Orders. 5.23.1.  For items requested through ILS-S, the first check comes the day after the backorder requests are processed.  The D04 is sent to Materiel Control for screening.  Using the AF Form 2005 suspense file, supply control log, AF Form 1823/-1 or parts ordering request, Materiel Control verifies all backordered items appear correctly on the D04.  The D04 also shows all issues,  due-out  release  actions,  turn-ins  and  cancellations.    If  cancellation  action  is  noted, research  the  cancellation  and  either  reorder  using  the  appropriate  NSN  or  eliminate  the suspense. 5.23.2.  For items ordered with an UND “A” or “B”, the D18 tells the user the latest status of the  backorder.    The  D18  is  reviewed  each  duty  day.    If  the  status  shown  in  the  report  is AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 171 unsatisfactory,  Materiel  Control  begins  follow-up,  supply  assistance  or  supply  difficulty action. 5.23.3.  For items ordered through COPARS, Materiel Control coordinates with the vendor for status updates IAW the contract requirements. 5.23.4.  For items ordered through BPA or GPC, Materiel Control coordinates with the vendor for status updates.  Frequent follow up is essential to prevent unnecessary NMC time. 5.23.5.  The PCN SB004-015 also gives information for management to track delayed actions.  This  report shows delayed AF  Forms 1823/-1 with required action by delayed maintenance code. 5.24.  Processing Parts Receipts. 5.24.1.  Take the following steps when receiving parts from GPC,  ILS-S, COPARS,BPA or VPSO.  Mark the suspense slip, AF Form 1823/-1, parts ordering form or supply control log to show the receipt.  Hold the parts until the work can be scheduled.  Mark the parts with the work order number and registration number, and bin them.  Parts for the same vehicle may be binned together regardless of work order number.  Do not mix bench stock, working stock, work  order  residue  or  delayed  parts.    Mark  the  AF  Form  1823/-1  and  parts  ordering  form (Materiel  Control‘s  copy)  with  the  bin  location  in  the  space  provided.    Then  forward  the information to FM&A. 5.24.2.  When  the  OLVIMS  transaction  is  received  from  ILS-S,  verify  the  data  against  the suspense  copy  of  the  AF  Form  2005,  parts  ordering  form  or  the  supply  control  log,  before sending to FM&A for input in OLVIMS. 5.24.3.  The receipt process for GPC, COPARS,BPA or VPSO delayed parts is essentially the same.    Mark  the  AF  Forms  1823/-1  with  the  bin  location  and  advise  the  FM&A  Workload Controller of its receipt.  Verify sales slips or parts receipts and/or invoices before forwarding them to FM&A.  FM&A inputs a "PZ" transaction into OLVIMS containing a "D" charge code and a bin location number. 5.25.  Work Order and Backorder Validation. 5.25.1.  Screen UND "A" or "B" requirements and validate as outlined in AFI 23-101.  The basic record used to do the validation is the Materiel Control copy of the delayed AF Form 1823/-1. 5.25.2.  Despite these efforts, the manual records used to track delayed AF Forms 1823/-1 often disagree  with  the  true  needs  of  the  individual  vehicles.    Consequently,  Materiel  Control, together with  the  FM&A Workload Controller, conducts  an AF  Form 1823/-1 to  backorder reconciliation and validation. 5.25.2.1.  Reconcile  all  work  orders  either  monthly  or  quarterly,  or  as  directed  by  the VFM/VMS, in conjunction with the monthly UND “A”, “B”, and “C” validation outlined in AFI23-101. 5.25.2.2.  The first step of validation is a line-item review for each delayed AF Form 1823/-1.    Materiel  Control  compares  its  entire  delayed  AF  Form  1823/-1  file  to  the  FM&A Workload Controller's file of delayed AF Forms 1823/-1.  The delayed maintenance report is used at this time.  Update both sets of AF Forms 1823/-1 and the delayed maintenance 172 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 report as needed, to  bring all into agreement.  Resolve discrepancies before updating to ensure all records are accurate.  If there are large differences between these two files, the local procedures for coordination between the two functional units will be evaluated to find the cause.  (T-1). 5.25.2.3.  After FM&A and Materiel Control reconcile AF Form 1823/-1 records, Materiel Control  ensures  all  necessary  parts  are  backordered  and  reflect  positive  status  through GPC,    ILS-S,  COPARS  or  BPA.    Materiel  Control  cancels  the  backorder  for  items  no longer needed. 5.25.2.4.  Materiel Control will accomplish a complete inventory on all AF Forms 1823/-1 against which items have been received verifying bin location and quantity.  (T-1).  If, after  a  complete  search,  the  items  are  not  available,  the  shortages  are  recorded  and reordered.  If this is a common occurrence, implement a local procedure to ensure parts are adequately safeguarded.  (T-1). 5.25.2.5.  When these actions have been done: 5.25.2.5.1.  All records will be in complete agreement.  (T-1). 5.25.2.5.2.  All AF Forms 1823/-1 will be shown on the PCN SB004-015 report with the partial or complete parts indicator.  (T-1). 5.25.2.5.3.  All parts will have been backordered with positive status (including follow-up) or be on-hand.  (T-1). 5.26.  Partial or Completed Vehicle and Equipment Work Orders.  Materiel Control sends the completed work order to the FM&A Workload Controller for scheduling.  Each time a new work order is opened on a vehicle, all delayed work orders are thoroughly screened.  Every attempt will be  made to install received parts or accomplish maintenance  in order to complete any job listed in the job description block of the work order.  (T-1). Section 5F—Bench Stocks  5.27.  Purpose of Bench Stocks.  Bench stocks are established so that expendable supplies needed to  support  the  shop  are  always  available.    Failure  to  establish  the  proper  line  items  and  levels disrupts  the  shop  and  can  be  costly.    Bench  stock  responsibilities  and  procedures  for  its establishment and operation are in AFI23-101. 5.28.  Establishment  of  Bench  Stocks.  Establishment  of  a  bench  stock  is  a  coordinated  effort between  Vehicle  Management  and  LRS  Customer  Support  Section.    When  available,  vehicle Initial Support or Follow-On Spares Support List may be used as a guide in identifying the items and quantities to be stocked.  When those lists are available, the shop or work center supervisor makes a list, based on his or her estimate and judgment of the need.  The VFM/VMS approves the bench stock and Materiel Control sends the request to Bench Stock Support according to AFI23-101, Chapter 5.  Once bench stock is established, a copy of the Bench Stock Listing (S04) will be readily available and used.  (T-1). 5.29.  Shop and Collocated Bench Stocks, Working Stocks and Work Order Residues.   Note:    Bench  stocks,  working  stocks  and  work  order  residue  can  be  collocated,  however,  they must be separated and properly binned.  (T-1).  AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 173 5.29.1.  Shop bench stocks, working stocks and work order residues may be set up within each Vehicle Management shop or its equivalent.  Where two or more shops are collocated, a single bench stock, working stock and work order residue for their combined use is set up. Note:  Bench stocks, working stocks and work order residue can be collocated; however, they must be separated and properly binned.  5.29.2.  Under certain circumstances, it may be more advantageous (because of location, total number of line items,  cost  or pilferage) to  secure the bench stock, working stock  and work order residue, and operate it under a staffed environment.  When the VFM/VMS finds this to be more advantageous, consider consolidating this bench stock, working stock and work order residue with a tool room in the work area.  In any event, the overriding factor is the need of the shop. 5.29.3.  When using co-located bench stocks, working stocks and work order residues, units may want to display a bench stock "shadow board" outside the bench stock site, to be readily viewed by all personnel.  Old and unserviceable parts for each item authorized can be shown, with  the  item  or  bin  number  under  each  asset  as  an  easy  means  to  show  its  location.    Item descriptions may also be used in some cases. 5.30.  Low-Cost Bench Stocks. 5.30.1.  In  Vehicle  Management,  authorized  bench  stock  items  whose  unit  cost  (based  on  a unit-of-use issue from bench stock to an AF Form 1823/-1) is less than $60 is low-cost bench stock.  (For example, if a box of 12 fittings costs $67.50 and they are issued one at a time, the fittings would be shown as low cost). 5.30.1.1.  Replenish  low-cost  bench  stock  items  using  work  order  number  L9999.    This work order number is limited to "low-cost" items on authorized bench stock.  The purpose of work order number L9999 is to prorate the cost of commonly used low-cost bench stock items against the total cost of maintaining the base fleet. 5.30.1.1.1.  Low-cost parts that do not qualify as bench stock items may be purchased through  COPARS,  BPA,GPC  or  VPSO  using  the  work  order  number  or  the  vehicle registration number when an AF Form 1827 is used for minor repairs. 5.30.2.  Low-cost items may be on other unit bench stocks or working stocks.  Replenishment of bench stock items is IAW AFI23-101 Chapter 5. 5.30.3.  Bases are authorized to maintain shop stock.  Shop stocks include parts kits consisting of  universal-type  hardware  for  brake  systems,  hydraulic  systems,  electrical  systems,  etc., which are not normally economically handled as bench/working stocks.  VFM/VMS establish procedures for effective control and management of shop stock. 5.31.  High-Cost Bench Stocks. 5.31.1.  Items with a unit cost of $60 or more are defined as "high cost.”  Fast-moving, high-cost  items  can be authorized on bench stock when approved by the VFM/VMS.   Replenish high-cost bench stock using work order number H8888.  Use of H8888 causes the parts to be charged against a special "holding" account, rather than against the entire base fleet.  When the high-cost items are issued to specific AF Forms 1823/-1, they are charged against a vehicle using a “QZ” transaction. 174 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 Note:  Review paragraph 5.44. for additional guidance.  High-cost working stock items are not installed on a vehicle using an AF Form 1827.  5.31.2.  On  approval  of  the  VFM/VMS,  Materiel  Control  or  FM&A  completes  an  "EZ" transaction (see AFCSM 24-1) to add the item to the High-Cost Bench Stock Master List, PCN SB004-046. 5.31.3.  Make a line-item entry or attach a preprinted label to the vehicle’s AF Form 1823/-1 for each high-cost bench stock item issued. 5.31.4.  Materiel  Control  keeps  a  current  copy  of  the  PCN  SB004-046  listing.    At  least quarterly,  adjust  the  prices  on  the  PCN  SB004-046  based  on  the  latest  M14,  the  current COPARS price list or vendor’s price if purchased with the GPC. 5.31.4.1.  Delete items no longer on high-cost bench stock using an "EZ" transaction by placing a “D” in the “Delete Indicator “ block.  Input of this transaction clears the item from the PCN SB004-046. 5.31.5.  Request a new PCN SB004-046 listing when all changes, additions and deletions are made. 5.32.  Shelf-Life  Items.  Control  of  shelf-life  items  is  the  responsibility  of  the  Shop Bench/Working Stock Monitor once the items are placed in their bench/working stocks.  Shelf-life items are identified in TOs, by markings on the package and on the bench/working stock labels by the shelf-life code.   If the shelf-life item  is  packaged in  a unit pack, the unit pack containing a quantity nearest the recommended level is issued as the authorized bench/working stock quantity.  Use the oldest items first to prevent waste, First In First Out (FIFO). 5.32.1.  Do not open shelf-life item containers until needed.  If shelf-life items are loose in the bin and the expiration cannot be found, dispose of the items and replenish. 5.32.2.  Shelf-life items containing a HAZMAT will  be controlled by the base HAZMART.  These  items  will  only  be  issued  in  pre-authorized  quantities  to  those  shops  authorized  the material  and  IAW  AFI  32-7086,  Hazardous  Materials  Management,  Chapter  3.    Return unused, yet serviceable, HAZMAT to HAZMART if there is no immediate need.  HAZMATs which have a shelf life are to be purchased for Vehicle Management only in a quantity that can be used before its shelf life expires.  (T-1). 5.33.  Bench Stock Review.  This is the standard method of adding, changing or deleting bench stock items.  The bench stock review will be conducted IAW AFI23-101, Chapter 5.  (T-1). 5.34.  Working Stock. 5.34.1.  Working  stock  is  essential  to  ensure  certain  fast-moving  items  are  available  at  the Vehicle Management work site to reduce vehicle repair time.  VFM/VMS cautiously weigh the costs against the benefits when approving stock levels.  A separate working stock account is established for each outlying work center when approved by the VFM/VMS.  Maintain a locally  developed  working  stock  computer  listing  for  each  separate  account.    The  listing reflects the following information as a minimum: 5.34.1.1.  Part description. 5.34.1.2.  Part number. AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 175 5.34.1.3.  Unit of issue. 5.34.1.4.  Unit price. 5.34.1.5.  Quantity authorized. 5.34.1.6.  Bin location number. 5.34.1.7.  Low or high cost item. 5.34.2.  Working stock is limited to a 4-week level (based on past experience or consumption).  Certain bulk items (such as heater hose, etc.) are cheaper and easier to manage when bought in bulk; working stocks may be authorized for these and for seasonal items, even if their rate of use is low. 5.34.3.  Working stock replenishment is ordered against an L9999 work order number for low-cost items (items with a unit cost of less than $60) and an H8888 work order number for high-cost items (items with a unit cost of $60 or greater).  Low-cost working stock items replenished using work order number L9999 are prorated against the entire fleet in the overhead labor rate.  These  items  are  not  charged  against  individual  AF  Forms  1823/-1  when  consumed.  Conversely, high-cost working stock items replenished using work order number H8888 are held in a special holding account and are charged against the vehicle being repaired or serviced on an AF Form 1823/-1 using a “QZ” transaction. Section 5G—Repair Cycle Asset Management  5.35.  General  Information.  Repair  cycle  assets  are items  with  Expendability, Recoverability, Reparability Code (ERRC) “XD” and “XF”.  Examples are tires, some engines, etc.  These items are a large cost investment for the AF and are stringently controlled and cycled back into the system. those 5.35.1.  Materiel  Control  reviews  these  items  to  see  that  they  are  processed  according  to AFI23-101.    Materiel  Control  also  ensures  that  all  items  subject  to  repair  cycle  control  are managed and controlled according to the DIFM concept. 5.35.2.  Use  the  daily  AWP  Validation  Listing  (D19)  to  perform  identification  and  control checks,  and  prescribed  monitoring  procedures  and  files.    Close  coordination  with  the  LRS Flight Service Center or base Repair Cycle Activity is a must to ensure strict control of DIFM assets. 5.35.3.  DIFM items  (whether in  repair or in  stock) are deemed  assets available to  satisfy  a requirement and may be the only source of supply. 5.36.  DIFM Issues.  A request for repair cycle assets automatically places the transaction under DIFM control; usually, DIFM issues are for a quantity of one each.  For items for which multiple quantities may be needed (such as tires, matched sets, etc.) a multiple DIFM issue can be made.  When a multiple DIFM issue occurs, the quantity on the subsequent turn-in transaction cannot be split;  therefore,  if  separate  actions  are  anticipated  on  the  return  (e.g.,  condemned  and  recapped tires), restrict the quantity on DIFM issue requests to one each.  Since the DIFM issue document number  is  the  control  element  on  all  DIFM  transactions,  the  duplication  of  turn-in  document numbers could result in difficulty in tracing the transaction audit trail. 176 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 5.37.  DIFM  Status.  The  AWP  Validation  Listing  (D19)  is  a  daily  listing.    The  list  provides Materiel  Control  with  current  status  on  each  item  DIFM.    Materiel  Control  updates  the  DIFM detail  record  each  time  an  item  location  or  status  changes.    When  standard  DIFM  delinquency criteria  are  exceeded,  Materiel  Control  finds  the  cause  and  eliminates  the  delinquency.  Immediately reconcile any discrepancies noted on the D19 with the LRS Flight Service Center or base Repair Cycle Activity.  All  daily  changes to the D19 report are shown on the next  DIFM listing.  OLVIMS, PCNs SB004-016 and SB004-062 show delayed parts on hand that are DIFM controlled. 5.38.  Supply Points.  Supply points may be established for tires and other parts at the discretion of the VFM/VMS.  Operate supply points IAW AFI23-101; if established, will be IAW TO 36-1-191.  Forward supply points will be coordinated with the Material Management Flight and will be limited to levels not to exceed 90-day requirements based on historical usage that will be accessed annually.  VFM/VMS, and LRS Stock Control Managers establish manning requirements.  (T-1). 5.39.  DIFM  and  Supply  Point  Reconciliation.  Reconcile  supply  points  each  quarter  or  at  an increased frequency due to high volume of changes. Section 5H—Other Procedures for Materiel Control  5.40.  TCTOs. 5.40.1.  The AF rules on TCTO kit distribution are in TO 00-5-15-WA-1, AF Time Compliance Technical Order Process, and AFI23-101, Chapter 4.  The Vehicle IM at Robins AFB SE&V makes TO modifications, including assembly, storage and distribution of related TCTO kits.  Required parts and materials are controlled and sent according to the applicable TCTO. 5.40.2.  Materiel Control orders TCTO kits from the AF Form 2001, Notification of TCTO Kit Requirements. 5.40.2.1.  Enter  the  organization  and  shop  code  of  the  Vehicle  Management  shop responsible for doing the modification on part I of the form. 5.40.2.2.  Initiate AF Form 2001 in three copies, with copies one and two sent to the LRS Flight  Service  Center  or  base  Repair  Cycle  Activity  and  copy  three  filed  in  Materiel Control. 5.40.2.3.  Provide  due-in  document  number  to  FM&A  when  it  is  available  for  TCTOs requiring  a  TCTO  kit.    FM&A  provides  the  document  number(s)  and  registration number(s) to Robins AFB SE&V to request kit release. 5.40.3.  Materiel Control checks the status of TCTO needs using the D18.  Each time a TCTO kit asset is received, ILS-S generates an “IO29” management notice showing the total on-hand balance  and  each  existing  due-out  detail  record.    A  copy  of  this  notice  is  sent  to  Materiel Control.  Place it in the TCTO jacket file with the AF Form 2001.  A display board (the NMCS board  or  an  automated  control  board  may  be  used)  shows  the  following  information  for  all current and outstanding TCTOs: 5.40.3.1.  TCTO number. 5.40.3.2.  Due out document number. 5.40.3.3.  Quantity and unit of issue. AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 177 5.40.3.4.  Date requested. 5.40.3.5.  Current status. 5.40.3.6.  Quantity on hand. 5.40.3.7.  Date received. 5.40.3.8.  Mandatory compliance date. 5.40.3.9.  Remarks. 5.40.4.  Materiel Control tells the LRS Flight Service Center or base Repair Cycle Activity to force  a  due-out  release  of  the  kit  for  installation  when  all  items  are  received  and  the modification is scheduled. 5.40.5.  As requested, ILS-S produces a monthly TCTO kit reconciliation and status report to keep the shop informed of kit availability, shortages, excesses, due-outs and due-ins.  Materiel Control tells the LRS Flight Service Center or base Repair Cycle Activity of excesses, changes, or added requirements identified during the reconciliation. 5.41.  Tool Accountability and Issue Procedures. 5.41.1.  General Procedures. 5.41.1.1.  The VFM/VMS will develop an OI to specify tool accountability procedures to fit the local mission and physical shop layout.  (T-1).  At a minimum, the OI will require accountability and inventory procedures; spot checks; method of assigning tool locations identified  by  either  inlay  cuts  in  the  shape  of  the  item,  shadowed  layout  or  silhouette; security  requirements;  reporting  and  reimbursement  procedures  for  lost  and/or  missing tools.  (T-1).  If a tool crib is utilized, its operation is further detailed in this OI. 5.41.1.2.  All  tool  kits  and  tool  cribs  are  periodically  inventoried  and/or  spot-checked.  When  accountability  changes,  a  physical  inventory  is  performed  by  the  outgoing  and incoming responsible individuals, jointly, with Materiel Control.  All inventories and spot checks  will  focus  on  missing  tools,  serviceability,  safety  and  presence  of  unauthorized items in the tool kit/crib.  (T-1).  An inventory record includes the date the inventory was completed, the name of the individual who conducted the inventory and a remarks column.  (T-1). 5.41.1.2.1.  Technicians will perform accountability for their ITKs per local OI or on a daily  basis  at  the  end  of  their  shift.    (T-1).    Written  inventories  are  accomplished annually by Materiel Control, jointly with the technician.  (T-1).  Supervisors will spot check ITKs monthly.  (T-1).  Spot checks will be documented per local OI.  (T-1). 5.41.1.2.2.  Workcenter  supervisors  (or  their  designees)  perform  and  document accountability procedures for CTKs or tool cribs IAW local OIs, or on a daily basis, to ensure accountability of assigned tools and to prevent Foreign Object Damage (FOD).  (T-1).  Written inventories are accomplished semi-annually by Materiel Control, jointly with the supervisor or designee.  (T-1). 5.41.1.2.3.  Materiel Control will visually inventory tool cribs under their control at the end of their duty day to ensure accountability of  assigned tools and to prevent FOD.  (T-1).  When tool cribs are managed by outlying sections, section supervisors perform 178 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 this  duty.    Written  inventories  are  accomplished  semi-annually  by  Materiel  Control (jointly  if  assigned  to  an  outlying  work  center).    (T-1).    Tool  cribs  are  defined  as multiple CTKs collocated within a centralized work center with keys under control of two  or  more  individuals.    It  is  imperative  that  thorough  tool  crib  inspections  are accomplished due to multiple authorities issuing tools independently from each other per paragraph 5.41.2.  (T-1). 5.41.1.2.4.  During inventory, the individual turns in any deleted tools and receipts for the  remaining  tools  in  his  or  her  possession.    Code  shortages  Not  Issued  (NI)  and annotate  listing  with  due-in  information  for  backordered  tools.    The  individual completes the certification in ink on each page of the tool list to acknowledge receipt of the tools.  (T-1). Note:  Any change must be listed in ink and initialed in ink by the individual and Materiel Control. (T-1).  Destroy any old lists.  (T-1). 5.41.1.2.5.  Materiel  Control  advises  the  work  center  supervisor  when  backordered tools are received.  The responsible individual then goes to Materiel Control to pick up the tool and shows receipt by lining through the "NI" and dating and initialing the entry in ink.  All newly received tools must be properly marked with unit or shop designator and ITK or CTK number before placement in the ITKs or CTKs.  (T-1). 5.41.1.3.  The  VFM/VMS  approves  initial  issue  (basic)  ITK,  CTK  and  tool  crib requirements for each functional AFSC, work centers and/or individual tool kits by signing the inventory listing prior to issue.  Inventory listings include tool NSN and/or part number, nomenclature, and quantity authorized. Note:  VFM/VMS may provide blanket approval for initial issue inventories when tool kits are purchased in quantity as completed preassembled sets or boxes.  Blanket approval will be in the form of a Memorandum for Record, or administrative medium, and will include the effected tool kit number(s).  (T-1).  The VFM/VMS will sign the document and copies will be attached to manufactures‘ original inventory and stored with each tool kit folder.  (T-1). 5.41.1.3.1.  For  ITKs  being  issued,  Materiel  Control  enters  the  technician’s  name, grade  and  tool  box  number  at  the  bottom  of  the  inventory  list,  leaving  room  for signature. 5.41.1.3.2.  For  CTKs  and  tool  cribs,  Materiel  Control  enters  the  responsible  shop supervisor’s (or designee’s) name, grade and kit number at the bottom of the inventory list, leaving room for signature. 5.41.1.4.  Warranty hand tools are the standard for vehicle maintenance operations due to their high quality and free replacement policy. 5.41.1.5.  Replace  damaged  and  unserviceable  tools  on  a  one-for-one  exchange  basis through Materiel Control or the vendor. 5.41.1.6.  Use a separate DLA-DS holding area for condemned hand tools not exchanged with the vendor.  Transfer condemned expendable hand tools (by weight) to DLA-DS as scrap IAW AFI23-101,. 5.41.1.7.  Powered hand tools may be issued to CTKs, tool cribs or ITKs.  Ensure they are accurately accounted for due to their high replacement cost. AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 179 5.41.1.8.  All tools in ITKs, CTKs and tool cribs will have an assigned location identified either by inlay cuts in the shape of the item, shadowed layout or silhouette when stored in drawers,  shelves  and/or  walls  and  engraved  with  a  locally  assigned  kit  control  number designated by Material Control.  (T-1).  CTKs and tool crib control numbers include the shop initials. 5.41.1.9.  Materiel Control establishes and maintains custodial listings for all ITKs, CTKs and tool cribs assigned to Vehicle Management including outlying work centers.   (T-1).  Listings are maintained  electronically  or in folders, filed in control  (kit or box) number sequence, and include the responsible individual's name, AFSC, work center and kit control number. 5.41.1.10.  Due  to  the  high  expense  of  tools  and  equipment  required  for  operation  of  a Vehicle Management shop, pilferage concerns and the potential for tools to migrate to the flight line and potentially cause FOD, strict accountability is required.  Initiate ROS IAW AFMAN 23-220, Reports of Survey for Air Force Property, if items over $100 unit cost or $500 total cost are lost or there is evidence of abuse, gross negligence, willful misconduct, or deliberate unauthorized use, fraud, theft, or if negligence is suspected.  (T-1). 5.41.1.10.1.  Exceptions  to  initiating  ROS  must  be  approved  by  VFM/VMS  and  are usually based on unique circumstances surrounding the loss, and/or voluntary monetary reimbursement or replacement in kind is offered and accepted. 5.41.1.11.  Ensure  the  procedures  in  TO  32B14-3-1-101,  Operation  and  Service Instructions Torque Indicating Devices, are followed prior to the use of any torque device. 5.41.2.  Tool Crib Operations. 5.41.2.1.  A tool crib is a storage and issue point for common and specialized tools shown on one or more AS, typically collocated within one area and manned by assigned Materiel Control personnel.  Tool cribs are established when practical based on physical shop layout, Materiel Control manning and other local considerations.  VFM/VMS can designate other tools  to  be  controlled  under  these  procedures.    Materiel  Control  manages  tool  cribs authorized for the shop complex. 5.41.2.2.  A neat, clean, well-arranged tool crib is necessary to provide tool support and ease  inventory  requirements.    Segregate  special  tools,  if  possible,  by  vehicle  types  and display them on shadow boards or store them in bins.  Assign each item shown on a shadow board an item location designator.  Mark this designator on the tool if practical and on its storage position on the shadow board.  Post item identification and location lists near the issue  counter.    Store  common  items  and  those  not  suitable  for  the  shadow  board,  bins, inlaid in foam, plastic, wood, etc. 5.41.2.3.  Issue tools by AF Form 1297, a chit system, an automated system or other locally approved method.  Tools are not generally issued for a longer period of time than the user’s shift period without approval of the tool crib custodian.  Do not issue tools for personal use.  Set up a tool issue suspense system and check it each duty day to ensure tools are returned on time.  The shop supervisor is told of individuals who fail to return tools within the established suspense time as determined locally.  Advise the VFM/VMS of shops and personnel that continually fail to return tools on time. 180 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 5.41.2.4.  Mechanics must clean all tools before returning them to the tool crib.  The tool crib custodian inspects them on return to make sure they are clean, in good condition and free of corrosion. 5.41.2.5.  Materiel  Control  keeps  a  complete  list  of  all  tools  in  the  tool  crib.    The  list contains  NSN  and/or  part  numbers,  nomenclature,  authorized  and  on-hand  quantity  and other data as needed locally.  Perform a complete inventory semi-annually or when the tool crib custodian changes. 5.41.2.6.  Materiel  Control  ensures  Test,  Measurement  and  Diagnostic  Equipment (TMDE) tools are scheduled for calibration and certification according to TO 00-20-14-WA-1.  Use a visual display board or computer-generated listing to keep the current status of all TMDE requiring calibration.  Ensure all TMDE is accounted for on the semi-annual inventory. 5.41.3.  ITK Procedures. 5.41.3.1.  The tool custodian establishes initial accountability by obtaining the current ITK custody receipt listings and folders for all personnel assigned to the unit and issued  tool kits.    Materiel  Control  sub-receipts  ITKs  to  the  technicians  using  itemized  inventory listings. 5.41.3.2.  When personnel are transferred or  ITKs are no longer needed, the responsible technician  and  Materiel  Control  conduct  a  joint  inventory.    Annually  accomplish  joint inventories for all ITKs. 5.41.3.3.  Unless another technician is to be assigned, the VFM/VMS may choose to keep the kit in storage.  ITKs in storage are maintained by Materiel Control and have two copies of the tool list inside and shortages on order.  The ITK is tagged with the kit number and the date turned in. 5.41.4.  CTK Procedures. 5.41.4.1.  A CTK is established for common tools not suitable for ITKs.  Typically when a work center is physically separated from the tool crib, the use of a CTK(s) will save time and effort of the mechanics.  VFM/VMS may, however, dictate the use of CTKs in place of ITKs when deemed most practical.  CTKs will be maintained in a neat, clean and well-arranged  manner  to  best  provide  tool  support  and  ease  inventory  requirements.    Unless impractical, CTKs are maintained in storage bins, with tools engraved and inlaid in foam, plastic, wood, etc. 5.41.4.2.  Materiel  Control  manages  CTKs  which  are  sub-receipted  to  the  section supervisors  (or  their  designees)  using  itemized  inventory  listings.    The  tool  custodian establishes initial accountability by obtaining the current CTK custody receipt listings and folders for all CTKs in the unit. 5.41.4.3.  Materiel Control coordinates with applicable supervisors (or their designees) to update CTKs and perform inventories when kits are initially issued, semi-annually or when the  responsible  individual  is  transferred  and  a  new  one  is  assigned.    The  responsible individual and Materiel Control conduct a joint inventory at that time. 5.41.4.4.  Issue tools from a CTK by AF Form 1297, a chit system, an automated system or other locally approved method.  Tools are not generally issued for a longer period of AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 181 time than the user’s shift period without approval of the supervisor.  Do not issue tools for personal use.  VFM/VMS sets up a tool issue suspense system and the shop supervisor or his designee check the CTK(s) each duty day to ensure tools are returned.  These checks also include inspection to ensure tools are clean and in good condition. 5.41.4.5.  Materiel Control ensures tools and TMDE assigned to CTKs are scheduled for calibration and certification using the same procedures specified for the tool crib TMDE. 5.41.5.  Ensure shop equipment requiring an AFTO Form 244, Industrial/Support Equipment Record, is inspected and serviced monthly at a minimum unless more frequently required by manufacturer.  Also, ensure compliance with requirements in AFI 91-203. 5.41.5.1.  Ensure  procurement  of  special  tools,  test  equipment  and  training  for  newly received vehicles. Note:  The latest 441 VSCOS evaluations on new tools and equipment can be accessed at the VM Neighborhood. 5.42.  Tire and Battery Procurement/Management. 5.42.1.  All new tires and batteries will be directly charged via the AF Form 1823/-1.  (T-1). Notes: 1.  Vehicle maintenance functions are encouraged to use over-the-counter procurement of batteries on an exchange basis to minimize hazardous waste disposal and take advantage of standard warranties offered by commercial sources. 2.  Batteries must be accounted for on an as-received and issued basis for audit purposes.  (T-1). 5.42.1.1.  Use  work  order  number  H8888  for  all  vehicle-type  batteries  ordered  for  the battery shop.  Local procedures between Materiel Control and the battery shop supervisor assure that when batteries are installed, they are charged properly in OLVIMS, using the "QZ" materiel costing transaction. Note:  Batteries must be accounted for on an as-received and issued basis for audit purposes. 5.42.2.  Charge recapped tires purchased through ILS-S at the current recap percentage of the stock  fund  price  as  loaded  in  OLVIMS.    Recapped  tires  are  identified  by  a  -2  suffix  in  the NSN. 5.42.2.1.  Bulk  tires  recapped  using  local  contract,  AF  Form  9  or  GPC,  which  are  not tracked in the supply system, are input in OLVIMS using work order H8888.  Use of H8888 causes  the  cost  of  parts  to  be  charged  against  a  special  "holding"  account,  rather  than against the entire base fleet.  When the tires are issued to a specific AF Form 1823/-1, they are charged against a vehicle using a “QZ” transaction. 5.42.2.2.  For each tire issued, make a line item  entry or attach a preprinted label  to  the vehicle AF Form 1823/-1. 5.42.3.  Forward  supply  point  tires  (see  paragraph  5.38.)  are  issued  with  Transaction Identifier  Code  (TRIC)  “MS”  through  ILS-S  creating  the  OLVIMS  transaction  to  ensure proper tire costing and accountability. 5.42.4.  Tires will be procured/consumed in the following order when possible: 182 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 5.42.4.1.  Retread Tires  .  This program takes precedence over the acquisitions of new tires from any source.  If available, retread tires will be procured from the most economical source, provided the tires meet or exceed manufactures‘ specifications. Refer to paragraph 1.24, additional retread tire procurement instructions. 5.42.4.2.  New Tires.  When retread tires cannot be used or economically obtained, new tires will be procured from the most economical source, provided the tires meet or exceed manufactures‘ specifications.  (T-0). 5.42.5.  When determining the most economical source, Vehicle Management must consider the  “total  cost”  associated  with  each  tire  procurement.    (T-1).    For  example,  the  total  cost procuring from ILS-S (e.g., shipping and/or storage charges associated with the Tire Successor Initiative (TSI) Integrator fixed-price tire contract) versus the total cost associated with using non- ILS-S (local) sources. 5.42.6.  Regardless  of  tire  type  (retread  or  new)  and  procurement  source  (ILS-S  or  local purchase), all tires purchased must be individually annotated on the activity‘s GPP Log. Refer to paragraph 1.30.2.  (T-1). 5.42.7.  Contract  Vehicle Maintenance operations  are not  exempt from  the tire procurement order  listed  above,  or  from  the  GPP  Log  requirement.    Contracted  Vehicle  Management activities may purchase new tires directly from DLA (if the most economical source) through the DOD EMALL at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/emall.asp. Notes:   1.  The current TSI contractor has provided a toll-free 24-hour access number (855-865-7759) to be used by all tire customers worldwide.  The toll free number allows authorized customers to track both requisitions and shipments status. 2.  The DLA Land Supplier Operations Tire and Accessories eCatalog provides the capability to search, view, print, and export details for (TSI) tires, tire accessories, and wheel assemblies.  Go to: http://www.landandmaritime.dla.mil/Programs/Tirecatalog/Default.aspx, or can be found at http://tsi.purchaseplace.com. 5.43.  Work Order Residue.  Items left over from maintenance are placed in "work order residue" bins, preferably collocated but not commingled with bench stock.  Identify work order residue by NSN  or  part  number  and  date  established  as  residue.    If  there  is  no  foreseeable  need,  Materiel Control notifies all shop supervisors to take a "last look" to see if there is any need.  If not, the items  are  processed  for  disposal.    Develop  an  inventory  management  system  to  provide  quick reference for all work order residue items.  When a part is removed from residue and placed on a vehicle,  annotate  the  action  on  the  AF  Form  1823/-1  or  parts  request  form  by  writing  “W/O Residue”  in  the  job  description  block  or  parts  form  respectively.    This  action  will  provide management information concerning the source of the replacement part. 5.44.  Vehicle Redistribution and Transfer.  When vehicles are  redistributed or transferred to other AF bases or sent to DLA-DS, FM&A advises Materiel Control and applicable work center supervisors.    Upon  notification  of  a  vehicle  transfer,  Materiel  Control  will  cancel  any  parts  on order, turn in serviceable parts if no future need is predicted or move them to the work order residue area.  (T-1).  Work center supervisors will have applicable personnel make necessary changes to bench stocks, working stocks, work order residues and TO libraries.  (T-1). AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 183 5.45.  Antifreeze  Procurement.  Vehicle  Management  activities  are  required  to  recycle  their antifreeze or only use reclaimed engine coolant.  However, there are exceptions and documentation requirements.  Material Control personnel will refer to paragraph 1.24 for specific procurement guidance and exceptions. 5.46.  Lead-Free  Wheel  Weight  Procurement.  Lead  wheel  weights  are  not  authorized  for purchase and will be replaced with lead-free wheel weights through attrition.  See Table 5.1 Lead-Free Wheel Weights Available Through the Supply System. Table 5.1.  Lead-Free Wheel Weights Available through the Supply System  184 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 Chapter 6 TRAINING Section 6A—General Information  6.1.  General Information.  Successful operation of AF Vehicle Management activities depends on the knowledge of assigned personnel and how well they accomplish the mission.  The CFETP for  Vehicle  Management  is  a  comprehensive  training  program  outlining  specific  training requirements  Vehicle  Management  personnel  should  receive  as  they  progress  throughout  their career.  Career Field Functional Managers at all levels participate in developing the CFETP and use it to tune their training programs toward achieving the plan’s overall goals. 6.1.1.  The VFM/VMS (or senior base level Vehicle Manager) is the Functional Manager for the Vehicle Management specialty at their respective location. 6.1.2.  The VFM/VMS will offer training opportunities to tenant organizations that have 2T3 personnel assigned when Vehicle Management training resources are not available in the 2T3‘s assigned unit.

Establishing  and  Managing  Vehicle  Management  Training  Program.  Vehicle Management  training  is  more  than  progressing  through  the  CDCs  and  completing  core  tasks.  Various  and  complex  vehicle  systems  combined  with  frequent  personnel  changes  demand  a comprehensive, active training program that includes training beyond the initial skill-level upgrade process.  The program must also include training mechanics on new or improved troubleshooting techniques, specialized test equipment and advanced vehicle systems.  (T-1).  FM&A personnel receive  advanced  training  on  analysis  techniques  and  fleet  management  processes.    An  all-inclusive training program will include the key areas listed below. 186 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 6.4.1.  First  is  the  actual  skill-level  awarding  requirements  achieved  through  the  CDCs  and core task completion. 6.4.2.  Second  is  in-house  training  to  keep  mechanics  proficient  on  new  technologies  and expand  on  the  basic  principles  learned  during  the  initial  upgrade  training.    The  in-house training will also assist in duty qualifying mechanics. 6.4.3.  Third, and one of the most important areas, is qualification training.  As personnel rotate from overseas to CONUS bases or into new duty positions, they often need task training to be duty position qualified.  If not properly task trained, possible injury or death could be the result. 6.4.4.  Finally,  a  training  program  will  also  include  specific  training  on  unique  hazards  of specific  vehicle  types  and  incorporate  the  use  of  Operational  Risk  Management  (ORM) principles.    (T-1).    Safety  is  paramount  to  day-to-day  operations  and  it  is  critical  trainers identify these hazards prior to the start of any task training.  (T-1). 6.4.5.  The VFM/VMS will ensure all technicians are advised of the existence of the Vehicle Maintenance Safety Handbook during initial job safety training.  (T-1).  The VFM will also encourage  the  use  of  the  handbook  during  daily  operations.    (T-1).    The  handbook  can  be downloaded from the VM Neighborhood. 6.5.  OJT.  OJT consists of two parts; the first is career knowledge and is achieved by the use of CDCs  or  other  applicable  technical  references  listed  in  the  CFETP  and  the  second  is  task performance and is provided during the actual hands-on training and qualification of core tasks identified in the CFETP.  Refer to AFI 36-2201 Chapter 6, for further guidance for setting up an OJT program. 6.5.1.  CDC Administration.  CDCs contain information on basic principles, techniques and procedures  common  to  Vehicle  Management.    Upgrade  trainees  are  enrolled  in  electronic-CDCs (e-CDC); however, if conventional CDCs are needed, the UTM can order all CDC sets (as  applicable)  at  one  time.    This  reduces  overall  training  upgrade  time  significantly  by eliminating the 4-6 week waiting time between sets, but it does not change the time requirement to complete CDCs.  IAW AFI 36-2201, trainees have 30 days to complete each volume of their CDCs from the date the volume is issued to them.  A trainee will not be issued more than one volume at a time.  (T-1). 6.5.1.1.  Supervisors (with assistance from the Vehicle Management Training Leader) will determine volume sequence of study and set the overall course completion schedule. 6.5.1.2.  The  Vehicle  Management  Training  Leader  will  use  a  local  tracking  system  to ensure volumes are completed within 30 days of issue.  (T-1).  Members of ANG, AFRC and Individual Mobilization Augmentees have 60 days to complete each CDC Volume. Note:  For more information concerning the Air Force Career Development Academy‘s (AFCDA) e-CDC program go to the AFCDA e-CDC website at: https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/AE-ED-02-37.   6.5.1.3.  Supervisors  will  determine  the  reason  for  slow  progress,  counsel  the  trainee, document the counseling as a Journal Entry within the trainee’s TBA IPT and place the trainee in supervised study. 6.5.1.4.  Pre-testing.  Pre-testing  is  a  very  effective  tool  in  determining  the  current knowledge level of the trainee and can minimize Course Exam failures.  VFM/VMS will AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 187 develop local guidance for pre-testing trainees prior to taking the Course Exam as part of the Master Training Plan or OI.  (T-1). 6.5.1.4.1.  A pre-testing policy will include the following: 6.5.1.4.1.1.  When to administer the pre-test, after each volume or after each set.  (T-1). 6.5.1.4.1.2.  Minimum passing score for each pre-test administered.  (T-1). 6.5.1.4.1.3.  The number of pre-tests given prior to the Course Exam.  (T-1). 6.5.1.4.1.4.  Frequency of re-testing for trainees that fails to achieve the established passing score on the pre-test.  (T-1). 6.5.1.4.2.  VFM/VMS will conduct an interview with the trainee, trainee‘s supervisor and Vehicle Management Training Leader at least 3 days prior to Course Exam day.  (T-1).  The interview will focus on the confidence level of the trainee to pass the test and can provide ample time to postpone the Course Exam if necessary.  (T-1). 6.5.2.  Core Task Completion/Qualification.  Most of the 2T3 AFSCs have more than 100 core tasks that must be completed before a trainee will be upgraded and task completion is the most time-consuming portion of the upgrade process.  Vehicle Management Training Leaders, with assistance from the work center supervisors, will develop projected milestones for core task completion that can correspond with CDC completion.  (T-1).  A proactive approach to core task completion/qualification will ensure the trainee is upgraded in a timely manner.  The training visibility ledger within TBA will be reviewed monthly for personnel not progressing on tasks for more than thirty days.  (T-1).  Trainers will document legitimate reasons, such as deployment or TDY within the Journal Entry section of TBA.  (T-1). 6.5.2.1.  Review scheduled maintenance requirements when developing timelines.  Since every vehicle is inspected annually, this will provide a good starting point to help determine vehicle availability for each month. 6.5.2.2.  Identify the number of tasks a trainee will complete per month and meet with the trainer and trainee to discuss the upcoming month‘s core task completion goals.  (T-1). 6.5.2.3.  Trainers will use lesson plans to ensure all trainees are trained at the same level, no  matter  who  is  doing  the  training.    (T-1).    Trainers  may  use  or  benchmark  the Standardized  Lesson  Plans  and  Core  Task  Performance  Standards  that  are  available  for download from the VM Neighborhood. 6.5.2.4.  Trainers will provide trainees safety briefings to identify hazards specific to the current vehicle or system being trained.  (T-1). 6.5.3.  MTP.  A MTP will be developed and maintained by the work center supervisor and will reflect duty position requirements to reflect 100 percent task coverage.  (T-1).  For guidance developing a MTP, refer to AFI 36-2201. 6.5.4.  Rotation Plan for 7-Levels.  Rotate mechanics in upgrade training to the 7-skill level through each section of Vehicle Management.  Allow sufficient time for the trainee to gain a working knowledge of the section.  FM&A personnel will be rotated internally within their section to ensure competency in all areas of their specialty.  Personnel rotation is deemed an essential element of an individual’s upgrade training and deployment preparation. 188 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 Note:  To ensure 7-level mechanics continue to stay proficient, consider rotating them through each section of Vehicle Management as workload and mission allows.  6.5.4.1.  If mission requirements and work load allows, VFM/VMS may rotate experienced 5-levels through all work centers to increase breadth of experience and help prepare them for  deployment  tasking(s).    This  also  helps  minimize  the  impact  of  high  deployment tasking(s)  on  home  station  operations  by  increasing  the  available  manpower  to  perform unique tasks. 6.5.5.  Tracking  Time-In-Training.  It  is  important  the  training  program  includes  a mechanism to track the amount of time an individual has been in upgrade training.  This could be a metric used by the VFM/VMS to measure supervisory involvement in upgrade training.  The goal for the training program is established in the CFETP. 6.5.6.  Graduate Assessment Survey (GAS).  As part of its training effectiveness evaluation, AETC  requests  evaluations  of  recent  graduates  from  field  units.    The  GAS  is  sent  to  the supervisors of graduates approximately 90 days after formal course graduation. 6.5.6.1.  HQ AETC, in conjunction with 2AF, has converted to a web-based process that enables the supervisors of graduates to complete the GAS electronically.  Supervisors will be notified through e-mail from base education.  Paper-based surveys will still be sent to those isolated units that do not have access to electronic mail or internet.  Guidance can be found in AFI 36-2201. 6.6.  In-House  Training.  The  ever-increasing  cost  of  maintaining  vehicles  demands  trained mechanics pass on what they have learned to other mechanics.  The rapidly changing technology used on vehicles requires the AF mechanic to stay proficient on theory of operations, diagnostic procedures and test equipment.  The in-house portion of the program accomplishes this type of training and will include both classroom instruction and hands-on progress checks.  (T-1).. 6.6.1.  The  in-house  program  will  include  various  levels  of  training  on  the  following  main vehicle systems: 6.6.1.1.  Automotive electrical and electronics.  (T-1). 6.6.1.2.  Brake systems.  (T-1). 6.6.1.3.  Wheel alignment.  (T-1). 6.6.1.4.  Automatic transmissions and transaxles.  (T-1). 6.6.1.5.  Engine cooling and climate control.  (T-1). 6.6.1.6.  Four wheel drive and differentials.  (T-1). 6.6.1.7.  Engine repair.  (T-1). 6.6.1.8.  Engine performance diagnosis, emission testing and tune-up.  (T-1). 6.6.1.9.  Oxyacetylene and welding (for contingencies).  (T-1) 6.6.2.  Consider  taking  a  "Phase"  approach  when  developing  classes  within  the  nine  main areas.  This will provide the framework for a progressive approach and allow mechanics to enhance their skills as they move through each phase of the training. AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 189 6.6.2.1.  Phase I covers the basic vehicle systems and will target the entry-level mechanics.  Some classes may include: 6.6.2.1.1.  Basic electricity. 6.6.2.1.2.  Brake systems. 6.6.2.1.3.  Steering system. 6.6.2.1.4.  Engine cooling and heating. 6.6.2.1.5.  Automatic transmission. 6.6.2.1.6.  Four wheel drives and differentials. 6.6.2.1.7.  Valve trains. 6.6.2.1.8.  Fuel systems. 6.6.2.2.  Phase II trains mechanics to a higher level of complexity and include classes in: 6.6.2.2.1.  Chassis instrumentation. 6.6.2.2.2.  Power brake systems. 6.6.2.2.3.  Power steering systems. 6.6.2.2.4.  TBI and PFI Injections. 6.6.2.3.  Phase III trains the mechanics to the more advanced level and can include classes on manufacturer-specific systems: 6.6.2.3.1.  Ford air conditioning systems. 6.6.2.3.2.  Chrysler automatic transaxle. 6.6.2.3.3.  GM automatic overdrive. 6.6.2.3.4.  Transfer cases. 6.6.2.3.5.  Differentials. 6.6.2.3.6.  Engine block rebuilding. 6.6.2.3.7.  Valve refacing. 6.6.2.3.8.  Drum and rotor lathe operation. 6.6.2.3.9.  Antilock brake systems. 6.6.2.3.10.  Wheel alignment. Note:  The automotive systems and areas listed above are not all-inclusive or may not apply to all 2T3XX mechanical AFSCs.  Supervisors and VM Training Leaders will refer to the 2T3XX Specialty Training Standard when selecting In-House Training program courses for selected AFSCs or workcenters. 6.6.2.4.  Phase  IV  prepares  mechanics  specifically  for  the  National  Institute  for Automotive Service Excellence (ASE) exams.  ASE is the industry standard for measuring mechanic competency, and VFM/VMS will encourage this type of certification for those mechanics that wish to pursue ways to improve personal technical skills. 190 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 6.6.2.5.  Phase  V  incorporates  the  use  of  commercial  advanced  classes  from  various manufacturers  (i.e.,  GM,  Ford,  Chrysler,  Oshkosh,  etc.).    These  types  of  classes  are normally taught at a very advanced level and may seem overwhelming for younger, less-experienced mechanics.  This is why only the most experienced mechanics will attend this type of training. 6.6.3.  Identifying Needs.  First, determine local training requirements: There are several ways: 6.6.3.1.  Solicit feedback from supervisors and mechanics. 6.6.3.2.  Work with FM&A to perform data analysis on specific system codes or recurring maintenance for various vehicles.  This should assist in identifying negative maintenance trends  and  pinpoint  mechanics‘  weak  areas  that  need  to  be  strengthened  using  focused remedial  training.    This  is  an  ongoing  requirement  given  that  mechanics  are  constantly rotating in and out. 6.6.4.  Training Aids/Materials.  There are several media types that can be used to assist in the classroom instruction. 6.6.4.1.  Commercial Trade Publications.  Information technology has overcome the need to subscribe to trade publications in many instances.  Information relating to management and upkeep of vehicles is readily available on the Internet.  VFM/VMS will determine their needs and sources for obtaining this information or publications.  (T-1). 6.6.4.2.  Web-based Course Material.  On-line training courses are  available from  many commercial companies.  On-line courses can save the administrative time required to keep information updated but are more expensive then videotapes. 6.6.4.3.  Training  Aids  (Vehicle  Components).    Vehicle  system  mock-ups  reinforce  the theory  of  operation  and  diagnostics  by  providing  hands-on  demonstration.    Figure  6.1. shows some training aids manufactured using vehicle components from salvaged vehicles. 6.6.4.4.  Videotapes.  Videotapes are the most common training aid used in the classroom and are great for supplementing classroom lectures but are not very student interactive. 6.6.4.5.  DVD/CD-ROMs.  Interactive training DVDs or CD-ROMS offers a flexibility and superiority not found in ordinary linear training videos. 6.6.5.  Selecting  In-House  Training  Instructors.  Key  to  a  successful  in-house  training program is supervisory involvement.  The supervisors are the most experienced and possess an understanding for what it takes to complete the day-to-day tasks.  This is why the training leaders are encouraged to recruit the supervisors to fill the role as classroom instructors. 6.6.5.1.  The  Vehicle  Management  Training  Leader  will  develop  an  internal  program  to enhance the classroom instructional skills of the instructors.  (T-1).  This will not only build the  confidence  of  the  instructor  but  will  also  improve  the  quality  of  the  delivery  of  the information. 6.6.5.2.  Classroom  instructors can improve personal  teaching techniques by  completing the Air Force Training Course (Mandatory for all personnel identified as trainers and task certifiers).  Note:  See Unit or Base Training Manager for course details. 6.6.5.3.  Instructors will conduct at least one class as often as possible to stay proficient in the subject matter.  (T-1). AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 191 6.6.5.4.  The Vehicle Management Training  Leader will encourage instructors to  pursue ASE certification in the area they will teach.  This can bring increased credibility to them as an instructor. 6.6.6.  Scheduling  the  Training.  The  Vehicle  Management  Training  Leader  will  work closely  with  supervisors  to  ensure  trainees  are  available  for  training.    (T-1).    Consider scheduling classes during the first half of the duty day and try not to conduct classes longer than four hours per day. 6.6.6.1.  Classes do not need to include all trainees.  Classes can be developed for multiple days for smaller groups.  This will also minimize the impact on work center workloads. 6.6.7.  Progress checks and follow up.  It is important the training process include some type of tool to measure the effectiveness of the training upon completion of the class. 6.6.7.1.  Pre-tests and post-tests are great tools to determine if the instructor was successful with the delivery of the course material. 6.6.7.2.  A review of missed questions and open classroom discussions is another effective way to determine if the training was successful. 6.6.7.3.  Supervisor  and  student  feedback  through  the  use  of  critiques  and  informal conversations are good ways to identify areas needing improvement in the curriculum and delivery of the material. 6.6.7.4.  A long-term indicator for an effective training program is the decline in previously identified negative management trends. 192 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 Figure 6.1.  Vehicle Management Training Aids (photos courtesy of 633 LRS, Joint Base Langley-Eustis, VA)  6.7.  Qualification  Training.  Qualification  training  is  a  continuous  process,  starting  with  the individual's entry into service.  This portion of the program will train personnel on a specific duty position.  An example of a need for qualification training would be a Staff Sergeant reassigned from an overseas to a CONUS base who is not familiar with certain vehicles in the local fleet. 6.7.1.  Work Center Orientation and Initial Evaluation.  Supervisors must conduct a work center orientation and an initial evaluation for all newly assigned personnel within 60 days of assignment.  (T-1).  Both the orientation and evaluation must be documented in the individual‘s ITP as a journal entry within TBA.  (T-1). Exception:  Supervisors of ANG, AFRC personnel have 120 days to complete orientation/evaluation. Note:  Suspense will be automatically generated by TBA upon loading an individual into their work center.  It is important to review the TBA suspense system at least monthly. 6.7.1.1.  After identifying training requirements as part of the orientation and evaluation, the individual will be enrolled in the local in-house training track to get him or her duty position qualified.  (T-1). 6.7.2.  Management  Training.  The  VFM/VMS  determines  management  qualification training  needs  and  as  personnel  progress  into  supervisory/management  positions  they  will attend, at a minimum, the following courses: 6.7.2.1.  Supervisory Safety Training Course.  Contact the Unit Safety Representative or Unit Training Manager for scheduling training. AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 193 6.7.2.2.  Vehicle Maintenance Superintendent Course (L6ACW2T370  00AA).  (T-1). 6.7.3.  EPA  Certification  Training.  Technicians  whose  duties  include  Motor  Vehicle  Air Conditioners (MVAC) maintenance require training and certification.  They may also require specific certification if the local implementation of the EPA emissions control inspection and maintenance program contains provisions for the AF to perform this type of work.  The EPA, and  possibly  a  state  or  local  authority  implementing  the  program,  approves  course  of instruction and certification methods. 6.8.  Advanced Training. 6.8.1.  Commercial  and  Other  Governmental  Training.  Commercial  and  other governmental  sources  provide  many  excellent  training  courses,  as  do  manufacturers  of equipment and vehicles at factory and regional locations. Some mobile training courses can be scheduled on base.  The Vehicle Management Training Leader and VFM/VMS will seek local sources for commercial or other governmental training. MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staffs will aid in finding commercial sources. Once a training source is located, review AFI 36-2201 for advanced training procedures, and Table 4.1. for funding requirements. 6.8.2.  Inter-service  Training.  Special  training  by  other  DOD  or  Federal  agencies  can  be arranged by AETC.  Review AFI 36-2230_IP, Interservice Training, for details. 6.8.3.  AFS  Training.  Specialty  training  and  advanced  courses  available  for  Vehicle Management  personnel  can  be  found listed  at https://etca.randolph.af.mil/.  This includes basic and advanced courses.  Submit requests for this  type  of  training  through  the  MAJCOM.    These  courses  are  available  for  all  Vehicle Management skills including FM&A personnel. the  2T3XX  CFETP  and  are in 6.8.4.  Advanced  AETC  and  MAJCOM  Courses.  Advanced  and  special  courses  are conducted  at  AETC  Technical  Training  Centers,  the  European  Technical  Training  Center (ETTC) and the Pacific Technical Training Center (PTTC); or via AETC, USAFE and PACAF MTT courses at the host base facilities.  Personnel selected for this type of training are normally at the 5-skill level or higher.  Request this training through the MFM. 6.9.  ASE.  ASE  is  the  automotive  industry  standard  of  competency.    Since  it  recognizes  an individual’s accomplishments, ASE certification serves as an impartial, third-party endorsement of a mechanic’s knowledge and experience on a national, even international, basis. 6.9.1.  ASE  certification  is  a  voluntary  professional  commitment  to  recognize  qualified  and competent  individuals.    It  is  an  indicator  of  a  mechanic’s  initiative  to  enhance  personal technical skills.  VFM/VMS will encourage participation. 6.9.2.  DELETED. 6.9.3.  DELETED. 6.10.  DELETED. 6.11.  “Maintenance  Purposes  Only”  Vehicle  Operator  Certification.  The  VFM/VMS appoints  “Maintenance  Purposes  Only”  vehicle  trainers,  in  an  OI,  who  will  ensure  that  vehicle management  personnel  receive  vehicle  safety  and  equipment  familiarization  training  before authorizing operation of a government vehicle for maintenance purposes.  (T-1). 6.11.1.  Follow procedures in AFI 24-301.  (T-1). 194 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 6.11.2.  Personnel will retain a copy of the most current and signed AF Form(s) 171, Request for Driver’s Training and Addition to U.S. Government Driver’s License, when transferring to another unit and give to new supervisor.  (T-1). Note:  “Maintenance Purposes Only” vehicle operator certification will not satisfy local law enforcement licensing requirements if vehicle operators are not properly licensed for off base/site use.  Check with local law enforcement authorities to ensure compliance with local laws if vehicles are tested off base/site.  All personnel who operate AF vehicles (other than for “Maintenance Purposes Only”) must have a valid AF Form 2293, USAF Motor Vehicle Operator Identification Card.  (T-1).  Contractor employees must follow procedures in AFI 24-301. (T-1). AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 195 Chapter 7 DOCUMENTATION AND RECORDS ADMINISTRATION Section 7A—Introduction And Documentation Rules  7.1.  General  Information.  This  chapter  contains  the  procedures  for  Vehicle  Management documentation and records administration. 7.2.  General Description and Basic Principles of the Vehicle Management Data Collection System. 7.2.1.  The VFM/VMS ensures all day-to-day business of the Vehicle Management activity is properly  documented.    Collect  data  by  converting  maintenance  repair  work  to  codes  and recording those codes in spaces on forms.  The codes are computer processed to make summary reports, which are sent to VFM/VMS for use in analyzing, planning, scheduling and controlling the vehicle management effort.  This data is maintained as accurately and timely as possible. 7.2.2.  Labor hours spent on tire and battery build-up (not identifiable to a specific vehicle) are direct  hours.    Labor  cost  for  these  hours  is  prorated  by  OLVIMS  against  the  entire  fleet  as indirect  cost.    Indirect  productive hours (administrative, supervision,  etc.)  are automatically computed  by  OLVIMS  using  the  difference  between  direct  productive  and  indirect nonproductive hours and the employee available hours. 7.2.3.  Labor-hour data is entered on forms in hours and 10ths.  Minutes are recorded as 10ths of hours as follows: 01 through 02 minutes - .0 hour.  03 through 08 minutes - .1 hour.  09 through 14 minutes - .2 hours.  15 through 20 minutes - .3 hours.  21 through 26 minutes - .4 hours.  27 through 33 minutes - .5 hours.  34 through 39 minutes - .6 hours.  40 through 45 minutes - .7 hours.  46 through 51 minutes - .8 hours.  52 through 57 minutes - .9 hours.  58 through 60 minutes - whole hour. 7.2.4.  FM&A will create a weekly database backup (OLVIMS TF Option 4) on the last day of  each  work  week.    (T-1).    That  weekly  database  backup,  as  well  as  each  End  of  Day processing file, will be kept at off-site location for a minimum of 60 days.  (T-1).  The off-site location can be the VM Neighborhood or an LRS file server, providing the file server is not located in the same building as Maintenance Control. 7.3.  Use of Printed Characters.  Print all entries on records except for signatures and stamped initials of inspectors. 7.4.  Legibility.  Ensure that maintenance records are legible, complete and correct. 7.5.  Transfer and Disposition. 196 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 7.5.1.  FM&A ensures all records are complete when a vehicle is transferred to another base or to DLA-DS. 7.5.1.1.  Send  AF  Forms  1823/-1  in  the  historical  file  at  the  time  of  transfer  with  the records. 7.5.1.2.  FM&A  keeps  copies  of  vehicle  historical  records,  Static  Data  AZ,  BZ  and  CZ transactions and the last AFTO Form 91 for 1-year when a vehicle is transferred to another base.  Maintain these same records, as well as the document directing disposition action for vehicles transferred to DLA-DS for 4 years as per AFRIMS Table 24-03, Rule 01.00. 7.5.2.  Use USAF management code 4000 in place of the vehicle’s actual management code when processing vehicles for disposal once disposition instructions have been received (the final preparation for salvage work order only).  Use vehicle management’s RC/CC code and the using organization code of “0O” (Zero Oscar) for management code 4000 AF Forms 1823/-1.  Use management code 4000 for new vehicles processing in to the base or depot. 7.5.3.  Vehicle static data records for newly received vehicles will be put into OLVIMS when the using unit is known by using the proper vehicle management code, organization code and RC/CC code.  (T-1).  All acceptance inspections are initiated and records loaded within five working days after release of the vehicle from the receiving activity. 7.5.4.  Process  vehicle disposition  packages through all base-level  OPRs within 10 working days. 7.5.5.  “Closed”  vehicle  work  orders  to  include  accident/abuse,  final  disposition  approval documents and LTIs will be maintained IAW Table 24 in the AF RDS in AFRIMS.  (T-0). 7.5.6.  Delete  the  scheduled  maintenance  "next  due"  data  shall  be  from  OLVIMS  when  a vehicle is awaiting disposition instructions from 441 VSCOS.  (T-1). Note:  Print the BZ transaction screen prior to deleting the OLVIMS data and retain the printed document in the vehicle’s records jacket.  Change organization code to “0O”. 7.6.  Vehicle  and  Equipment  Records.  The  practice  of  physically  storing  and  filing  paper vehicle/equipment maintenance forms  and records has been the only option available for many years.    However,  the  practice  of  scanning  and  electronically  storing/filing  vehicle  records  (i.e., permanent and active vehicle historical records/documents (record jacket contents), processed AF Form 1827, etc.) to replace or augment a shop‘s “paper” filing system is preferred.  By converting to  electronic files, VM activities can store maintenance records in  an off-site location/server as back-up  files,  at  the  same  time  making  vehicle  maintenance/repair  historical  documentation readily available to repair shop personnel, including outlying work centers. 7.6.1.  Hard copy vehicle and equipment historical record (jacket) instructions. 7.6.1.1.  FM&A initiates a vehicle jacket file when a vehicle is first received. 7.6.1.2.  Make a historical  records file (jacket) for each vehicle maintained by the shop.  This record file has two sections, historical and active. 7.6.1.3.  File  historical  records  in  either  vehicle  registration  number  sequence  or  in management code and registration number sequence. AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 197 7.6.1.4.  File  all  material  in  the  active  (working  record)  portion  of  the  jacket  file  in chronological order and file material in the historical portion of the jacket file by record type, in chronological order. 7.6.2.  Electronic vehicle and equipment record instructions. 7.6.2.1.  FM&A will establish an electronic file plan.  (T-0).  Refer to Figure 7.1, Sample Electronic Vehicle Record File Plan. 7.6.2.2.  FM&A will establish a main-folder for each vehicle or vehicular equipment item listed on the OLVIMS Vehicle Master  List.    (T-1).   The name of the  folder will be the vehicle‘s  Registration  Number.    (T-1).    The  vehicle  management  code  or  VMIF nomenclature may also be part of this folder‘s name. 7.6.2.3.  Contained within each vehicle‘s electronic main-folder will be two sub-folders: the Historical and the Active sub-folders.  (T-1). 7.6.2.4.  A “Vehicle Histories–Central File” will also be established.  (T-1).  This main file will store the historical record of vehicles that have been transferred or disposed.  (T-1). 7.6.3.  See the Vehicle and Equipment Records: Rules 1-13, located on the VM Neighborhood for filing directions for forms, documents, correspondence and other related data for vehicle and equipment records. Notes: 2.  All associate documents to the AF Form 1823/-1, e.g., AF Forms 4354 and 4355, AFTO 91, parts request forms, etc. will be scanned into one document, with the AF Form 1823/-1.  (T-0). 7.7.  Missing  Forms.  The  receiving  unit  asks  the  shipping  unit  to  send  missing  records,  or duplicate copies, when new or used equipment is received without complete records. 7.8.  Maintenance of Forms for Vehicles and Equipment in Extended Storage.  When placing vehicles  and  equipment  in  storage  as  stated  in  TO  36-1-191  or  like  directives,  record  vehicle maintenance inspections the same as if they were in an operational status.  Maintain records in an active file until the vehicle is disposed of. Figure 7.1.

Document names in the Active sub-folder should start with the date the form was finalized, 198 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 i.e., Work Order Close Date, followed by the W.O. number and AF Form number.  This will allow for sorting documents in chronological order. 2.  All associate documents to the AF Form 1823/-1, e.g., AF Forms 4354 and 4355, AFTO 91, parts request forms, etc. will be scanned into one document, with the AF Form 1823/-1. 7.9.  Processing  Vehicles  to  Vehicle  Management.  FM&A  schedules  and  controls  vehicle management and inspections.  Enter all work on an AF Form 1823/-1 or AF Form 1827 according to Chapter 4. 7.10.  Maintenance of Transient Vehicles. 7.10.1.  Vehicle Management inspects and repairs transient vehicles. 7.10.2.  Document and process transient vehicle AF Forms 1823/-1 as shown in this chapter, except that FM&A sends copies of the AF Forms 1823/-1 to the home station to ensure data is included in their historical records. 7.10.3.  The base that does the work assigns a management code of 5000 and a work order number prefix code to the AF Form 1823/-1. 7.10.4.  It  is  not  necessary  to  total  OLVIMS  AF  Form  1823/-1  entries,  as  the  system automatically produces a transient vehicle listing that shows total cost.  FM&A sends the listing to the transient vehicle’s home base. 7.11.  Vehicles Assigned TDY or Deployed. 7.11.1.  A copy of the Vehicle Historical Record is sent with each vehicle operating on TDY for 30 days or longer.  (Exception:  A copy of the current vehicle historical record accompanies each vehicle or vehicular equipment item sent TDY for special weapons movement, regardless of the duration of the TDY).  At the TDY station, FM&A ensures that each service, repair and inspection is  updated on the vehicle historical  record and that the form  is  returned with  the vehicle when the TDY is over.  At local option, on return from TDY, the home station FM&A will  update  the  original  vehicle  historical  record  with  new  data  from  the  TDY  copy  by initializing an AF Form 1823/-1.  (T-1). Table 7.1.  DELETED. 7.11.2.  When vehicles are sent TDY for more than 30 days, the home station, the TDY station and the TDY vehicle operator or supervisor complies with  the procedures  below which are necessary to provide cost, repair and inspection data to the home station. 7.11.2.1.  The home station FM&A attaches a card  showing the mailing and e-mail address of the home station FM&A and the scheduled data for that particular vehicle with the copy of the vehicle historical record.  When the vehicle arrives at the TDY station, the Vehicle Management  activity  receiving  the  copy  of  the  vehicle  historical  record  and  the attachments immediately notifies the home station of the address of the supporting FM&A activity.  The operator or TDY team supervisor is responsible for this action if management support is provided by another government agency or commercial source. 7.11.2.2.  For vehicles on TDY, FM&A at the TDY station controls the vehicle historical record, PM&I and Special Inspection data.  It sets up schedules with the TDY personnel for  turning  the  vehicle  in  for  PM&I  and  Special  Inspections.    The  TDY  station  FM&A sends the vehicle return listing (PCN SB004-019) to the home station as they are received.  AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 199 Send copies of AF Forms 1823/ 1823-1, Operator‘s Inspection Guide and Trouble Reports, and other appropriate records to the home station when the TDY station no longer needs them for reference. 7.11.2.3.  For  TDY  vehicles  supported  by  another  government  agency  or  commercial source, the vehicle operator or TDY team  supervisor sends copies of completed agency work  order,  job  order,  repair  order  or  invoices  (AF  Form  15,  United  States  Air  Force Invoice (NOT LRA), or Commercial Fleet Service Card) to the home station and transcribes data to the duplicate vehicle historical record. 7.11.3.  For vehicles on TDY for 30 days or less, FM&A at the TDY station or the operator sends the vehicle return listing and AF Forms 1823/-1 or invoices, as indicated above, to the home station.  All records generated during the TDY are generally returned to the home station with the vehicle. 7.11.4.  Include  the  Vehicle  Historical  Record  in  the  documentation  package  to  accompany vehicles deploying in support of contingency operations. Section 7B—Operator's Inspection Guide and Trouble Report Forms  7.12.  General Information. 7.12.1.  The  two  Operator‘s  Inspection  Guide  and  Trouble  Report  forms  used  by vehicle/equipment operators are listed below: 7.12.1.1.  AF  Form  1800:    for  use  with  all  registered  vehicles  and  vehicular  equipment except refueling vehicles and FSE. 7.12.1.2.  DELETED. 7.12.1.3.  AF Form 4427: for use with all refueling vehicles and FSE. 7.13.  Procedures for Recording Discrepancies and Delaying Maintenance. 7.13.1.  Operators  record  any  discrepancies  found  during  inspections  which  require maintenance in the “Vehicle/Equipment Discrepancy and Maintenance Report” section of the appropriate Operator’s Inspection Guide and Trouble Report form, and report them to Vehicle Management.    Note:    Operators  do  not  make  entries  in  the  “Maintenance  Report  Status” section of the forms, except for end-of-month closeout as stated in paragraph 7.17.1.  7.13.2.  When an operator reports discrepancies in any of the safety-type systems or devices, as described in paragraph 3.19.2.2, that could adversely affect the safety of personnel or the operation of equipment, that maintenance is not delayed and the vehicle or vehicular equipment item will not be continued in service.  (T-1).  The VFM/VMS, or a qualified representative, resolves any question about the seriousness of a discrepancy, decides whether the discrepancy can be delayed and if it can, initials the maintenance report section on the inspection guide.  At contract  Vehicle Management locations, the Functional  Area Chief (FAC) or QAP resolves any discrepancy issues. 7.14.  Instructions for the Operator’s Inspection Guide and Trouble Report.  The following instructions apply to all both forms.  These forms are described in three sections. Notes: 200 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 1.  AF Forms 1800 and 4427 allow VCO/VCNCOs to electronically enter “Heading”, “Items to be Checked” information and proper front and rear tire pressures, as well as “Beginning and/or Ending of the Month Operating Miles/Hours” information. 2.  441 VSCOS may approve form entry/completion variations for contracted vehicle management activities, provided such variations are in keeping with the spirit and intent (operator maintenance/accountability documentation and monthly maintenance documentation) of the forms. 7.15.  Heading Information.  The using organization enters the heading data (top portion of front, page 1) and issues forms for each vehicle or vehicular equipment item on the 1st duty day of the month.  The operator who performs the first inspection of the new month closes out the previous month‘s form by carrying forward the required entries according to the following paragraphs.  The operator  will  ensure  the  previous  month‘s  form  is  returned  to  the  using  organization‘s VCO/VCNCO.  (T-1).  The new form will be kept with the vehicle while in use.  (T-1). 7.16.  Items  to  Be  Checked,  Operator’s  Signature  and  Monthly  Tire  Pressure  Check.  A general  listing of  items  to  be checked during the Operator‘s  Inspection are listed on the forms.  Specific areas/items requiring inspection will be identified by using organization by placing  an “X” in  the  column adjacent  to  the specific  area/item row.    (T-1).   The numbered  rows that  are labeled “OTHER” can be used for locally added items.  This is especially useful when adapting one of the forms to a peculiar equipment item.  Items to be added will be coordinated between the user and the maintenance shop.  (T-1). 7.16.1.  Each item requiring an Operator‘s Inspection is serviced, checked and/or operationally tested during each inspection (refer to paragraph 3.19)  To keep the form neat, operators will not make any entries, check marks or initials, on the rows where items are listed other than the “X” mentioned above.  (T-1). 7.16.1.1.  On the AF Form 4427 only, space has been provided for the Fuels Management Team (FMT) to sign and date once the form has been completed/reviewed.  An optional space has been provided to document “Corrosion Control” on page 3, IAW TO 36-1-191, Table 6.3, Corrosion Severity Zones and Minimal Wash Intervals. 7.16.2.  Space is provided for an operator's signature corresponding to the numbered day of the month (and shift on the AF Form 1800) on page 1.  An operator's legible signature consisting of first initial and last name (opposite the appropriate day of the month) shows completion of inspection or servicing for each item. 7.16.2.1.  Further, the operator's signature shows the entry of item numbers (AF Form 1800 only) for which a discrepancy is being reported on the discrepancy and maintenance report or, the signature could show that the operator is aware that the entry is already being carried in a delayed or waiver status.  Leave blank or void entry on the operator signature lines opposite the days of the month an inspection was not performed (non-use days) or required. 7.16.2.2.  The operator certifies completion of the inspection even though the discrepancies found and reported to Vehicle Management may result in placing the vehicle NMC.  If the vehicle is returned to service that same day, the operator has only to make a brief visual check. 7.16.3.  Vehicle operators will perform monthly tire pressure check (to include spare tire) at the interval listed in TO 36-1-191, Table 3-1, and document completion on page 2 of the AF AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 201 Form 1800 or page 3 of the AF Form 4427.  (T-1).  VCO/VCNCOs may electronically enter the vehicle‘s manufactures recommended tire pressure on the form, however operators must check and adjust pressure as required.  (T-1). Notes: 1.  Monthly tire pressure checks will be completed and documented regardless of organizational utilization of the vehicle.  (T-1). 2.  Documentation of spare tire pressure check on the appropriate Operator’s Inspection Guide and Trouble Report is not required. 3.  Vehicles equipped with electronic Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS), are not exempt from performing this requirement. (T-1).   Exception:  The monthly tire pressure check for vehicles that are NMC during the first 10 calendar days of the month will be completed and documented by the operator at the time the vehicle is released/pick-up from maintenance.  (T-1). 7.16.4.  The Fuels Manager/Superintendent will review all AF Form 4427 monthly; sign and date appropriate block on page 1 to certify review completion.  (T-1). 7.17.  Discrepancy and Maintenance Report Section (page 2).  This section is used by operators and vehicle management personnel  for documenting vehicle discrepancy  and reporting actions, and  the  disposition  (maintenance  action/status)  of  discrepancies  listed.    However,  Vehicle Management may also use this section to record the completion of scheduled inspections and/or discrepancies found during service/repairs. 7.17.1.  Before  entering  a  discrepancy,  both  Vehicle  Management  personnel  and  operators must  check  the  discrepancy  list,  and  status  to  avoid  duplicate  reporting  and  processing  of discrepancies.  (T-1).  When a new monthly form is initiated, all open discrepancies (when the date under “Maintenance Report Status” is blank) are transferred to the new form and “C/F” (carried forward) entered in the blank "Date" block of the old form. 7.17.2.  Additional instructions for completing this part of the form are as follows: 7.17.2.1.  Item No.  Enter the "item number" of the inspection guide‘s "Item to be Checked" list against which a discrepancy is being reported.  Leave blank when the discrepancy is not related to a numbered item. (AF Form 1800 only) 7.17.2.2.  Discrepancy.  Enter a brief description of the discrepancy. 7.17.2.3.  Date Disc (Discovered).  Enter the date the discrepancy is found and entered. 7.17.2.4.  Date/Time.    Enter  the  date  and  time  (24-hour  clock  time;  e.g.,  1730)  that  the vehicle or equipment was turned in for repair or request for maintenance support (mobile, wrecker, etc.) was received (reflect period that vehicle is not operational). 7.17.2.5.  Miles/Hours.    Enter  the  current  hour  meter  or  odometer  reading  next  to  the discrepancy. Note:  Do not include “tenths”.  7.17.2.6.  Name.  The individual completing the "Reported To Maintenance" part of this form prints their name in this space. 202 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 7.17.3.  FM&A personnel, VFM/VMS, a work center representative or shift supervisor, CSC personnel  or  Mobile  Maintenance  technicians  complete  Maintenance  Report  Status  entries. The VFM/VMS will prescribe permanent waiver forms use and/or a locally developed system to track waivered deficiencies.  (T-1). Note:  The work center supervisor or designated personnel identifies items on the AF Form 1823/-1 that are permanently waived.    FM&A and/or CSC transcribe these items to the permanent waiver form or system of record. 7.17.3.1.  Work Order Number.  Enter the work order number (block 2 of AF Form 1823/-1 or AF Form 1827) on which the discrepancy is annotated for maintenance action.  Enter "None" if repairs were not required or if the discrepancy was waivered without an AF Form 1823/-1 or AF Form 1827 entry. 7.17.3.2.  Date.  Enter the AF Form 1823/-1 or AF Form 1827 close-out/completion date.  If the maintenance action is delayed, leave the date blank and enter the appropriate status code. 7.17.3.3.  Status Code.  These codes are listed on the bottom of the form.  The codes are self-explanatory, except that code "W" (waiver of repair) is intended to identify items that do not require repair or replacement, and do not adversely affect safety or performance of the  equipment.    Additional  status  codes  may  be  adopted  locally,  according  to  need,  for more detailed status information.  Items entered in the discrepancy block which could not be validated by maintenance are dated, a "N" status code entered, and technicians employee identification  number  is  entered  in  the  maintenance  report  section  of  the  Operator's Inspection  Guide  and  Trouble  Report  form.    These  entries  are  made  only  by  Vehicle Management personnel.  An optional procedure can be used to keep waived items in the permanent  section  of  the  vehicle  historical  record  jacket  as  a  backup  in  case  the  using organization  loses  or  damages  the  waiver  form  kept  in  the  vehicle.    A  computer-based software program is also authorized for waiver control (preferred method).  At a minimum, wavered  items  will  be  reviewed  and  updated  when  vehicles  are  turned  in  for  scheduled maintenance.  (T-1). 7.17.3.4.  Employee Number.  The person who assigns a status code to a discrepancy enters their OLVIMS employee number in this block. 7.17.4.  Status  code  entries  will  not  be  made  by  FM&A  or  a  representative  until  all management processing is performed and the vehicle is being released for use.  (T-1). 7.17.4.1.  For delayed status codes, the date is not entered until the completed AF Form 1823/-1 is received, at which time the old status code is lined out or over stamped with a corrected code. 7.17.4.2.  Each  time  FM&A  or  a  representative  processes  an  inspection  guide  form,  all discrepancies in a delayed or code C-T (temporary fix) status are checked. 7.17.5.  Fuels Laboratory Use Only Section.  This section on the AF Form 4427 will be used by Fuels Laboratory personnel to document fuel system sampling status resulting from work performed  on  the  vehicle/equipment.    (T-1).    Fuels  Lab  personnel  will  complete  the “Laboratory Use Only” portion before the vehicle/equipment is placed back into service.  (T-1). AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 203 7.17.6.  Disposition  of  the  Operator’s  Inspection  Guide  and  Trouble  Report.  Maintain prior month forms IAW Table and Rule T 24 - 03 R 14.00 in the AF RDS in AFRIMS. Section 7C—AF Forms 1823/-1, Vehicle and Equipment Work Order  7.18.  General Information.  The AF Form 1823 is used by Vehicle Management shops that are not supported by OLVIMS.  The AF Form 1823/-1 is a computer-generated form used by Vehicle Management  shops  supported  by  OLVIMS.    Instructions  and  information  for  completing  this computer-generated  form  are  in  AFCSM  24-1.    Work  order  open  and  close  procedures  are  as follows:  FM&A will print as many copies of the AF Form 1823/-1 as locally required.  (T-1).  The shop uses a legible  copy to  tell  the technician what  repairs  are needed.  One copy may be retained in FM&A for workload scheduling and monitoring.  Close the AF Form 1823/-1 in the computer when the shop‘s copy has been completed. 7.19.  Special Recording Procedures.  All  work performed by Vehicle  Management personnel not  recorded  on  an  AF  Form  1827  must  be  entered  on  an  AF  Form  1823/-1.    (T-1).    Contract maintenance,  accident  repair,  other  government  agency  repair  and  final  quality  assurance inspections are shown by annotating the AF Form 1823/-1 appropriately. Notes: 1.  The individual performing the final quality check will sign and either enters an "X" in the block or circles “PASS” or “FAIL” depending on the work order form being used.  (T-1). 2.  AF Form 754, Work Order Log and Quality Control Record (NOT LRA),or similar locally developed product, will be used to track final quality checks and/or to log work order/vehicle information and should be used in the event OLVIMS cannot be utilized.  (T-1). 7.19.1.  Make two AF Forms 1823/-1 when repairs are performed at the same time by Vehicle Management  and  contract  maintenance  or  when  government  parts  are  provided  to  the contractor. 7.19.1.1.  If in-house repair is started and a part is repaired by contract maintenance, open and then close the contract maintenance AF Form 1823/-1 (same date and time) to prevent duplication of NMC time and to expedite the contract repair work. 7.19.1.2.  The in-house AF Form 1823/-1 must stay open until all repairs (contract and in- house) are done.  (T-1). 7.19.1.3.  The contract maintenance AF Form 1823/-1 stays in the work order master file until the contract repair work (JZ) transaction is processed. 7.19.2.  Actual TCTO AF Form 1823/-1 entries are the same as for other types of maintenance, except that block 21, “Job Description”, shows the TO data code number.  On AF Form 1823/-1, enter system code “43CZ” to indicate “user defined.”  Enter a work order number prefix code "T" in block 2. Note: Report compliance IAW Chapter 4.  7.19.3.  SB and OTI AF Form 1823/-1 entries are the same as for other types of maintenance, except that block 21, “Job Description”, shows the SB number or OTI subject.  Enter system code 43CZ to indicate “user defined” on the AF Form 1823/-1.  Enter a work order number prefix code "S" in block 2. 204 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 7.19.4.  Accident  repair  AF  Form  1823/-1  contains  only  the  repairs  caused  by  the  accident.  Annotate other repairs on a separate AF Form 1823/-1.  Accident repair  is  identified in  the upper, right-hand corner of the AF Form 1823/-1.  All labor and material charges for accident work orders are charged as "M" (maintenance).  An AF Form 1823/-1 is made for all accident repairs. 7.19.5.  Contract maintenance and other government agency AF Forms 1823/-1 are identified as such in the upper, right-hand corner of the AF Form 1823/-1.  When the FM&A copy is processed,  a  contract  maintenance  indicator  is  displayed  to  show  the  contract  or  other government  agency  status  of  the  Work  Order  Master  File  Status  Report,  PCN  SB004-018.  FM&A  checks  all  completed  contract  maintenance  documents  to  ensure  that  appropriate maintenance  data  is  entered  to  OLVIMS.    Review  PCN  SB004-018  prior  to  monthly processing to ensure all required contract costs are entered into OLVIMS. 7.19.6.  Delayed  maintenance  AF  Forms  1823/-1  is  identified  by  putting  the  appropriate maintenance code in block 19.  On an AF Form 1823/-1, the delayed code should be put in the “ACTION TAKEN” block.  When a delayed item appears on the shop‘s copy of a completed AF  Form  1823/-1  (as  shown  by  maintenance  code),  the  FM&A  Workload  Controller immediately makes a new AF Form 1823/-1 for these items only.  (T-1).  Closing AF Form 1823/-1  with  delayed  jobs,  the  system  automatically  prints  a  delayed  AF  Form  1823/-1  for those jobs only. 7.19.6.1.  On  AF  Form  1823/-1  delayed  work  order,  leave  the  work  order  number  and kilometer, miles and hours blocks blank.  The work order  number from the original AF Form 1823/-1 is entered on the top margin of the new AF Form 1823/-1.  On the delayed AF Form 1823/-1, the delayed work order number is printed in the middle of the AF Form 1823/-1.  Print all other information as if this was an actual AF Form 1823/-1, with the exception that the word “DELAYED” prints in the upper, right-hand corner. 7.19.6.2.  The original AF Form 1823/-1 is input in the computer for processing.  Update delayed maintenance on the AF Form 1824, Motor Vehicle Work Order Status (see Section 7D.) Note:  Refer to AFCSM 24-1 for a list of work order number prefix and maintenance delay codes used for AF Form 1823/-1 entries.  7.19.7.  The AF Form 1823/-1 for accident repairs includes the following costs on separate line entries for damaged vehicles. 7.19.7.1.  All direct labor and material costs. 7.19.7.2.  Indirect cost. 7.19.7.2.1.  Shop indirect cost equals direct labor hours expended to repair the vehicle times  the  indirect  hourly  rate  on  the  Employee  Master  List,  PCN  SB004-029  (these costs are not to be used for assessing ROS charges). 7.19.7.2.2.  Towing costs equals miles towed times wrecker O&M cost per mile plus operator’s hourly rate times the number of hours used or actual cost if contracted. 7.19.7.2.3.  Storage cost, if identified on an off-base invoice. AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 205 7.19.7.2.4.  The loss of use cost.  This cost is computed by dividing the total service life (months) into the acquisition cost.  Then multiply the computed use cost per month by the number of months out of service.  The provisions of this paragraph only apply if a replacement vehicle is required to be leased during the repair process. Note:  If any combination of the above was completed by off-base contractors, the invoice will be used to compute the loss of use cost if a commercial or GSA vehicle is leased to replace the damaged vehicle in repair.  (T-1).  Attach a copy of each invoice used and a copy of the completed AF Form 20 to the AF Form 1823/-1. 7.20.  How to Fill Out an AF Form 1823/-1. 7.20.1.  Block 1, Replacement Code Change.  (One-time repair, age or miles).  If the repair cost exceeds the one-time repair limit and it is decided not to repair the vehicle or vehicular equipment  and it is returned to  the user, check the one-time repair block  and enter the new replacement code.  FM&A makes the necessary changes to update the vehicle master list PCN SB004-023.  The computer should automatically update the code to A, B, C or D, as applicable. 7.20.2.  Block 2, Work Order Number.  Always five characters.  The first character is always an alpha character that shows the type of work being done.  See AFCSM 24-1, Attachment 4, for a list of approved prefixes. 7.20.3.  Block 3, Reimbursable Distribution (R/D) Code.  A one-position code that shows how costs are distributed (reimbursable or refundable) to a tenant organization or transient vehicle.  FM&A loads the applicable code in OLVIMS for those vehicles assigned to the base and makes an entry on the AF Form 1823/-1 for applicable transient vehicles.  The proper code is obtained from Accounting and Finance.  See to paragraph 7.49.  7.20.4.  Block  4,  Registration  Number.    Enter  the  vehicle’s  registration  number.    The registration number is always eight positions. 7.20.5.  Block 5, USAF Management Code.  Enter the vehicle’s management code. 7.20.6.  Block 6, Miles/Hours.  Enter hours, miles or kilometers as shown on the vehicle‘s hour meter or odometer.  Round the entry to the nearest whole hour, mile or kilometer.  For vehicles that have both hour meters and odometers installed, determine the proper entry from the vehicle master list.  For vehicles or equipment managed underutilization code "U”, leave this block blank.  The incoming inspector validates the odometer or hour meter reading. 7.20.6.1.  New odometers or hour meters are set to show the accumulated miles, hours or kilometers.    The  cumulative  figure  may  be  obtained  from  the  latest  quick  reference  or vehicle master listing.  If the new odometer or hour meter cannot be preset, then the past accumulated miles, hours or kilometers become the "add-on" figure in OLVIMS using the "AZ"  transaction.    Once  the  "add-on"  has  been  entered  into  OLVIMS,  only  the  present meter reading needs to be entered on the AF Form 1823/-1. 7.20.6.2.  During  the  period  that  odometers  or  hour  meters  are  inoperative,  then  show cumulative miles, hours or kilometers on the quick reference listing, minus any indicated "add-on.” 7.20.6.3.  For  vehicles  with  inoperative  odometers  or  hour  meters,  use  the  accumulated miles, kilometers or hours on the latest maintenance quick reference list for all service and 206 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 maintenance  documentation,  as  the  miles,  kilometers  or  hours  value  is  adjusted  in  the OLVIMS by the mileage estimator. 7.20.7.

Enter the date and the 24-hour clock time the vehicle was released from Vehicle Management or the management support (mobile, etc.) was completed and the vehicle returned to the user (reflect period that vehicle is not operational). 7.20.15.  Block  15,  Repair  Estimates.    Use  blocks  15A  through  F  for  estimating  costs  of accident repairs and repairs that may cause the one-time repair limit to be exceeded.  Make this estimate before work is started to avoid unauthorized repairs. 7.20.15.1.  If the repair action places the vehicle in replacement codes A, B, C or D for maximum one-time repair cost and the decision is made by the VFM/VMS not to repair the vehicle, check block 1 and forward an LTI to 441 VSCOS for disposition instructions. 7.20.15.2.  Indirect  costs  are  entered  in  block  15D.    The  indirect  hourly  rates  can  be obtained from the Employee Master List, PCN SB004-029. 7.20.16.  Block 16, Job Number.

If  more  than  seven  jobs  are  required  to  repair  a  vehicle,  continue  entries  on addition  (blank)  AF  Form  1823/-1  can  be  made  using  the  same  work  order  number  and changing the job numbers in block 16 to 8 through 14.  A new AF Form 1823/-1 work order number is required for any vehicle with over 28 jobs. AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 207 7.20.17.  Block  17,  System  Code.    The  four-digit,  alphanumeric  code  shows  the  system, subsystem and component codes on which work was performed.  The OLVIMS ―Help File‖ lists the approved codes. 7.20.18.  Block 18, Operations.  No entry required. 7.20.19.  Block  19,  Maintenance  Code.    Use  this  code  to  identify  delayed  and  NMCS maintenance conditions.  See AFCSM 24-1 for codes and descriptions.  FM&A enters these codes on the shop's copy of the AF Form 1823/-1. 7.20.19.1.  When a delayed item is shown on the shop's copy of the completed AF Form 1823/-1,  the  FM&A  Workload  Controller  makes  a  new  AF  Form  1823/-1  (in  sufficient copies) for the delayed item. 7.20.19.2.  Enter the work order number, date and time from the original AF Form 1823/-1 on the top margin of the new AF Form 1823/-1.  Input the data from the original AF Form 1823/-1 in OLVIMS. 7.20.20.  Block 20, Action Taken.  The work center enters or circles the letter-code that best shows the actual maintenance action.  Refer to AFCSM 24-1 for a list of the 13 action codes. 7.20.21.  Job Description Blocks.  Enter a brief description of the job to be performed.  For TCTO accomplishment, enter the TO and data code number.  This entry should be clear and tell the technician the exact malfunction and what has to be done. 7.20.22.  Block  22,  Estimated  Labor  Hours.    CSC  enters  the  estimated  hours  to  do  the  job described in block 21.  Use the estimated hours for workload planning, scheduling maintenance and productivity assessments. 7.20.22.1.  If the work performed does not agree with the job described on the AF Form 1823/-1,  FM&A  enters  a  revised  estimated  hour  for  the  job  actually  performed.    For example, if the job description called for brake shoe replacement, but an adjustment fixed the problem,  then an estimated hour  rate for the  adjustment must be entered on  FM&A copy of the AF Form 1823/-1 also. 7.20.22.2.  If the work center supervisor enters additional jobs on the AF Form 1823/-1, they must also be entered on FM&A copy and the estimated labor hour rate revised.  (T-1). 7.20.23.  Block 23, Employee ID Number, Labor Hours and Overtime Indicator.  Enter in the upper portion of the block the employee identification number of the technician who did the job.  Enter in the lower portion of the appropriate block the actual labor hours used to do the job.  This entry is in hours and 10ths.  Use an overtime or holiday work code when the actual labor  hours  were  expended  during  these  periods.    (AFCSM  24-1  contains  these  codes.)    If actual labor hours are used during both normal duty hours and overtime periods, the technician must make separate entries.  (T-1). Section 7D—AF Form 1824, Motor Vehicle Work Order Status   7.21.  General Information.  AF Forms 1824 may be used by FM&A to update information on the Delayed Maintenance Report (PCN SB004-015) via OLVIMS.  Vehicles and equipment items are automatically entered on the delayed maintenance report for delayed maintenance repairs as a 208 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 result of the maintenance code in block 19 of the AF Form 1823/-1.  The AF Form 1824 is also used to start and stop NMCS hours in OLVIMS, add or change bin locations, transfer delayed parts costs, and delete or adjust labor hours. 7.22.  How to Fill Out an AF Form 1824. 7.22.1.  When the first part is received against a delayed AF Form 1823/-1, Materiel Control bins the part and gives FM&A an AF Form 1824 showing the bin location so that the delayed maintenance record may be updated.  This is accomplished by making the following entries: 7.22.1.1.  Work Order Number.  Enter the work order number from the AF Form 1823/-1. 7.22.1.2.  Date.  Enter the date the form is initiated. 7.22.1.3.  Bin Location.  Enter the bin location and place an "X" beside the "Z" under Type Transaction.    Once  the  bin  location  has  been  established,  all  subsequent  part  receipts against that delayed AF Form 1823/-1 should also be assigned to that bin.  If a new bin location is desired for additional parts, a new AF Form 1824 must be submitted reflecting the new location.  (T-1).  The new bin  location  will only  affect  future parts as they are received and will not affect parts already on hand.  Parts received without a bin location established will display  a location of “XXX” on the PCN SB004-015;  changing the bin locations for parts already on hand is accomplished with a "SW" transaction. 7.22.2.  When Materiel Control tells FM&A that a change in the status of parts and material has been received for a delayed AF Form 1823/-1, FM&A creates an AF Form 1824 to reflect this change by making the following entries: 7.22.2.1.  Work Order Number.  Enter the work order number from the AF Form 1823/-1. 7.22.2.2.  Date.  Enter the date the form is initiated. 7.22.2.3.  Parts Status.  Enter an "X" in the block beside either the letter "P" or "C" as the parts  status  code.    The  letter  "C"  (complete)  is  entered  when  all  parts  and  material  to accomplish delayed repairs on a specific AF Form 1823/-1 have been received.  The letter "P" (partial) is entered to show only partial receipt of delayed parts or material.  The letter "P" is programmatically entered by OLVIMS when the first part is received and therefore only  be  entered  when  a  previously  completed  delayed  action  reverts  to  a  partial  due  to cannibalization. 7.22.3.  When  all  delayed  work  against  a  specific  maintenance  code  has  been  completed, FM&A  creates  an  AF  Form  1824  to  delete  that code  from  the  delayed  maintenance  file  by making the following entries: 7.22.3.1.  Work Order Number.  Enter the work order number from the AF Form 1823/-1. 7.22.3.2.  Date.  Enter the date the form is initiated. 7.22.3.3.  Code (block under Current/Original Data section of form).  Enter the code to be deleted. 7.22.3.4.  Labor Hours (block under Current/Original Data section of form).  Enter a “0” (Zero).  Note:  If the code deleted is the only one for which the vehicle is currently delayed, the entire AF Form 1823/-1 will be removed from the file.  However, individuals cannot AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 209 zero out all delayed hours on any AF Form 1823/-1 for which parts are still being reflected on the Delayed Parts File. 7.22.3.5.  Work Center (block under Current/Original Data section of form).  Enter the last three digits of the work center where the maintenance was delayed. 7.22.4.  When it is necessary to adjust delayed labor hours, FM&A submits an AF Form 1824 with the following entries: 7.22.4.1.  Work Order Number.  Enter the work order number from the AF Form 1823/-1. 7.22.4.2.  Date.  Enter the date the form is initiated. 7.22.4.3.  Code  (block  under  Current/Original  Data  section  of  form).    Enter  the  code needing adjustment. 7.22.4.4.  Labor Hours (block under Current/Original Data section of form).  Enter adjusted labor hours (hours and tenths). 7.22.4.5.  Work Center (block under Current/Original Data section of form).  Enter the last three digits of the work center in which the adjustment took place. 7.22.5.  When informed that maintenance delayed for one reason has now changed to another or  that  maintenance  delayed  in  one  work  center  has  been  transferred  to  another,  FM&A initiates  an  AF  Form  1824  to  change  the  maintenance  code  or  work  center  by  making  the following entries: 7.22.5.1.  Work Order Number.  Enter the work order number from the AF Form 1823/-1. 7.22.5.2.  Date.  Enter the date the form is initiated. 7.22.5.3.  Code  (block  under  Current/Original  Data  section  of  form).    Enter  the  original code. 7.22.5.4.  Labor  Hours  (block  under  Current/Original  Data  section  of  form).    Enter  “0” (Zero). 7.22.5.5.  Work Center (block under Current/Original Data section of form).  Enter the last three digits of the original work center. 7.22.5.6.  Code  (block  under  New  Data  section  of  form).    Enter  the  maintenance  code required to be reflected in the delayed file. 7.22.5.7.  Labor Hours (block under New Data section of form).  Enter the adjusted backlog hours (hours and tenths). 7.22.5.8.  Work Center (block under New Data section of form).  Enter the last three digits of the new work center where the work is delayed. 7.22.6.  When  told  of  a  NMCS,  FM&A  initiates  an  AF  Form  1824  to  update  the  AF  Form 1823/-1 record on both the delayed and AF Form 1823/-1 master files, by making the following entries: 7.22.6.1.  Placing a vehicle "ON NMCS.” 7.22.6.1.1.  Work  Order  Number.    Enter  the  work  order  number  from  the  AF  Form 1823/-1. 210 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 7.22.6.1.2.  Date.

Due dates of hose tests should coincide with the due dates of fueling components when possible, as shown on AF Forms 1829.  Section 7H—Labor Hour Reporting, AF Form 1831, Indirect Labor Time Card and AF Form 1831-1, Indirect Labor Time Sheet  7.29.  Labor  Hour  Reporting.  The  motor  vehicle  labor  hour  reporting  system  is  based  on categorizing  labor  hours  into  three  areas:  Direct  (0  series),  indirect  productive  (20  series)  and indirect nonproductive (40 and 50 series).  These hours are categorized to show the efficiency of the vehicle activity by comparing productive hours with hours used to support that activity, such as  clerical,  supervisory,  material  chasing  and  so  forth.    The  third  category  of  labor,  indirect nonproductive,  shows  labor  hours  that  were  not  used  in  repairing  vehicles.    Labor  codes  and categories are explained in AFCSM 24-1. Note:  Reporting of indirect nonproductive labor hours is mandatory.  The VFM/VMS will monitor use of 40- and 50-series labor codes to ensure they are properly recorded and entered in OLVIMS, rather than have these hours default to indirect productive (20 series) labor hours.  (T-1).  Adjust available hours of personnel deployed in support of contingency operations or AEF rotations to zero. 7.29.1.  Direct labor hours used by maintenance technicians are entered on the AF Form 1823/-1 or AF Form 1827.  Use work codes to show whether hours were used during normal duty hours or overtime or holiday periods.  Work codes are shown in AFCSM 24-1. 7.29.2.  Indirect  productive  (20  series)  labor  hours  are  computed  by  OLVIMS,  with  the exception  of  20-series  labor  hours  used  during  periods  of  overtime  or  during  a  holiday.  Document overtime and holiday indirect productive labor hours on AF Form 1831 or AF Form 1831-1. 7.29.3.  Indirect nonproductive (40 and 50 series) labor hours are entered on AF Form 1831 or AF Form 1831-1 by shop personnel. 7.29.4.  Summarize and report work center labor hour utilization data on a monthly basis for management.  OLVIMS captures productive (0 series) labor hours entered on AF Forms 1823/-1 and overtime and holiday indirect productive labor hours, as well as indirect nonproductive labor hours entered on AF Form 1831 or AF Form 1831-1.  These hours are then subtracted from the total hours management personnel were assigned to calculate the indirect productive labor hours. 7.29.5.  Labor hours are collected for each employee by the employee’s identification number from AF Forms 1823/-1 and Indirect  Labor Hour Time Cards or  Indirect Labor Hour Time Sheets.  This data is then applied to a name in the Master Personnel File (PCN SB004029) and summarized to  a particular work  center by  OLVIMS.   There is  no attempt to  reconcile any AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 215 individual  employee’s  labor  hours.    As  a  consequence,  this  labor  hour  reporting  system  is considered ongoing;  that  is,  no closeout of AF Form 1823/-1 labor data is needed for labor hour balancing.  A sufficient amount of labor hour data within a work center offsets month-to-month highs and lows in this data. 7.29.6.  Through this labor hour reporting system, labor hour distribution and utilization data are readily available for use by vehicle managers at all levels.  AFCSM 24-1 describes labor hour reports. 7.30.  AF Form 1831/-1.  The AF Form 1831, or the OLVIMS-generated AF Form 1831-1 (AF Form  1831/-1),  can  be  used  as  a  “time  sheet”  to  record  an  individual’s  overtime  and  holiday indirect  productive  or  indirect  nonproductive  labor.    It  is  not  necessary  that  each  reportable employee  submit  one  of  these  labor  cards/sheets  each  reporting  period.    In  the  absence  of  an indirect  labor  card/sheet  for  any  employee,  the  data  system  assumes  that  all  the  labor  for  that employee is divided between direct and indirect productive labor hours.  Where no direct labor is put on AF Forms 1823/-1 for that employee, the system then assumes all assigned hours were used in the indirect productive (support) category, with no overtime or holiday hours used. 7.30.1.  The same AF Form 1831/-1 for each employee is used for the whole month.  At the end of the month, a copy is sent to FM&A for input into OLVIMS, unless otherwise directed by the VFM/VMS. 7.30.2.  FM&A receives a copy of the AF Forms 1831/1831-1 at the end of the month from all work  centers  for  processing.    When  the  labor  hour  utilization  summaries  and  reports  are complete, FM&A sends a copy to the appropriate work center. 7.30.2.1.  FM&A processes the individual time card or sheet  into a "GN"  transaction as outlined in AFCSM 24-1. 7.30.3.  AF Forms 1831 are not preprinted for individual employees.  All entries on the cards are  made  manually.    Separate  cards  are  used  for  an  individual  transferring  between  work centers to show labor hours in each work center. 7.30.4.  AF Form 1831-1 is preprinted with individual employees’ names and man numbers.  All other entries on these forms are made manually.  Separate sheets are used for an individual transferring between work centers to show labor hours in each work center. 7.31.  How to Fill Out AF Forms 1831/-1. 7.31.1.  AF Form 1831 entries. 7.31.1.1.  Block 1, Card Code.  FM&A always enters “G”. 7.31.1.2.  Block 2, Type Transaction Code (T/T/C).  FM&A enters "N" for OLVIMS sites. 7.31.1.3.  Block 3, Site Code.

With  the  work  center  supervisor‘s  assistance,  Materiel  Control initiates  an  AF  Form  1832  when  cannibalization  action  is  recommended.    Materiel  Control completes  the  "Action  by  Materiel  Control"  section  and  forwards  the  document  to  FM&A.    If cannibalization  is  not  needed,  no  further  action  is  necessary  and  the  AF  Form  1832  may  be destroyed.  If cannibalization is needed, workload control makes entries in their part of the form, and sends it to the VFM/VMS.  The completed AF Form 1832 provides the information needed for Vehicle Management to decide whether approval to cannibalize is justified. 7.33.  How to Fill Out an AF Form 1832. 7.33.1.  AF Form 1832 is attached to the AF Form 1823/-1 on file in Materiel Control.  Note:  If the parts are not going to be replaced on the cannibalized vehicle, a copy of the AF Form 1832 is filed in the cannibalized vehicle’s record jacket. 7.33.2.  Total  labor  costs  of  the  cannibalization  (that  is,  removing  the  part  from  the cannibalized vehicle and installing it on the vehicle to be returned to service) are charged to the vehicle on which the part is installed.  The labor and material costs of installing replacement items on the cannibalized vehicle are charged to the cannibalized vehicle. Exception:  If costs for repairs to the cannibalized vehicle are reimbursable, they are not charged to it; all costs are charged to the vehicle receiving the cannibalized parts.  AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 217 7.33.3.  Materiel  Control  ensures  that  replacement  parts  are  ordered  for  the  cannibalized vehicle according to Chapter 5, except as previously stated above. 7.33.4.

Also enter inspections that cannot be scheduled in OLVIMS. Note:   When OLVIMS is  not available, report compliance to 441 VSCOS at 441VSCOS.AF.VehMgt@us.af.mil. Section 7O—Vehicle Management Activity/Document Codes  7.42.  General  Information.  Codes  are  used  for  labor  hour  accounting,  for  collecting maintenance data and for preparing cost reports, which give management information to the base and 441 VSCOS.  See AFCSM 24-1 for most codes and descriptions. 7.43.  Work Center Codes.  The first four digits of these work center codes are mandatory and will  not  be  changed.    (T-1).    However,  the  fifth  digit  may  be  shredded  out  to  identify  specific functions within the activity (see codes 17221 through 17239 below). 7.44.  Work Codes.  Work codes (see AFCSM 24-1) are used for those bases using OLVIMS to support labor-hour reporting requirements. 7.45.  Work Order Number Prefix Code.  Work order prefix codes are used to show the type of work the AF Form 1823/-1 was primarily opened for (see AFCSM 24-1). 7.46.  Management Codes.  Management codes for registered vehicles and equipment items are found in the VMIF.  Management codes for non-registered vehicles and equipment items are found in the OLVIMS “Help File”.  Management codes which are not pre-loaded in OLVIMS will be rejected, in which case use the proper “alpha character” and “999” temporarily. 7.47.  Orphan  Management  Codes.  The  term  “orphan  management  code”  is  used  to  describe management codes that are not supported by OLVIMS.  This is due to the hard-coded management code table in OLVIMS that does not support new assets introduced into the fleet. 7.47.1.  To overcome this problem, an “Updates to OLVIMS Mgt Code Listing” is available on the VM Neighborhood.  The listing identifies management codes that are not supported by OLVIMS  and  links  them  to  a  management  code  existing  in  OLVIMS.    Once  loaded  in OLVIMS,  and  the  data  is  passed  to  LIMS-EV  Vehicle  View,  business  rules  will  cross-reference  the  asset  NSNs  with  the  VMIF  and  LIMS-EV  Vehicle  View  will  display  the appropriate management code. 7.47.2.  It is imperative that the appropriate asset NSN is loaded in OLVIMS along with all other vehicle static data. 7.48.  Delayed Maintenance Codes.  Delayed maintenance codes are used on AF Form 1823/-1 and the PCN SB004-015 to show the reason a repair action has been delayed.  Find these codes in AFCSM 24-1, Attachment 4, or in the OLVIMS “Help File”. 7.49.  R&D  Codes.  R&D  codes  denote  the  organization  for  which  charges  are  refundable  or reimbursable (see AFCSM 24-1, Attachment 4).  At the beginning of each FY, and when a change is required, FM&A furnishes a list of tenant organizations supported to Accounting and Finance (through  the  Budget  Office)  for  certification.    Accounting  and  Finance  identifies  which organizations are reimbursable (Code 3) or refundable (Code 4) (refer to AFI 65-601V1, Budget Guidance And Procedures, Chapter 7, and AFI 65-601V2, Budget Management For Operations, AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 223 Attachment 10.  Accounting and Finance returns this certified list to FM&A to be used to enter the correct codes into OLVIMS. 7.49.1.  All  reimbursable  and  refundable  cost  data  must  be  reconciled  monthly  with Accounting and Finance.  (T-1).

Identify  and  collect  energy  opportunities  and  will  submit  to  441  VSCOS  for consideration. 11.1.3.  VTAC.  The VTAC (refer to paragraph 3.4) includes energy management as a core function.  Any new energy opportunity or strategy that has the potential to change the business rules of the vehicle management enterprise is to be briefed by 441 VSCOS and voted on by the VTAC.  This includes new energy initiatives or strategies that are a result of both new Air Force policy or new federal policy and executive orders. 11.2.  Applicable  Laws  and  Directives.  The  following  list  (not  all-inclusive)  is  applicable  to vehicles identified in paragraph 1.1.2.: 11.2.1.  EPAct of 1992 and 2005. 11.2.2.  The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. 11.2.3.  EOs 13423 and 13514, Federal Leadership in Environmental, Energy and Economic Performance, October 5, 2009. AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 259 11.2.4.  DOD, SAF/AQ and SAF/IE policies concerning GPP. 11.2.5.  All mandates that direct Federal agencies to meet specific environmental targets.  For example: 11.2.5.1.  Alternative  fuel  use  in  AFVs  where  the  appropriate  alternative  fuel  is  readily available or obtain a waiver per EPAct 2005, Section 701. 11.2.5.2.  Increasing alternative fuels consumption by 10% a year through FY 2015 using FY2005 as the baseline. 11.2.5.3.  Reducing total consumption of petroleum based fuel by 2% a year through 2015 using FY2005 as the baseline. 11.2.5.4.  Acquiring plug-in  hybrids vehicles (PHEV) when  commercially available at  a cost reasonably comparable, on the basis of life cycle cost, to non-PIH vehicles. 11.2.5.5.  Improving  the  nation’s  air  quality  by  reducing  Green  House  Gas  (GHG) emissions and reducing dependence on foreign oil. 11.2.6.  Our  national  strategy  is  to  create  a  Federal  fleet  which  drives  the  country  to commercialize  AFVs  and  the  infrastructure  to  support  them.    DODI  4715.4,  Pollution Prevention,  18  June  1996,  further  requires  that  the  Secretaries  of  the  Military  Departments establish  programs  to  purchase  and  operate  AFVs  IAW  EPAct.    AFI  90-1701  provides information on the AF’s Infrastructure Energy Strategic Plan. Section 11B—AFV 11.3.  AFV  Acquisition.  EPAct  specifically  applies  to  general  purpose  “Light  Duty  Vehicles” (less than or equal to 8,500 pounds GVW) based in an MSA (cities, counties, or consolidated areas with a 1980 population of more than 250,000).  AFV requirements for each MSA installation in a given FY are calculated by multiplying the number of LDVs procured (new acquisitions and long-term rentals/leases) times the EPAct percentage required for that FY.  Seventy-five percent of all MSA-based LDVs acquired each year must be AFVs.  (T-0). 11.3.1.  Description of different types of AFVs and Electric Vehicles (EV).  The AF's AFVs, whether  purchased  or  rented/leased,  are  bi-fuel,  flex-fuel  or  a  dedicated  alternative  fueled vehicle, e.g., CNG, propane, E85, etc.  EVs can either be dedicated or hybrid technology. 11.3.1.1.  Bi-fuel  AFVs  have  two  mutually  exclusive  fuel  systems  and  are  designed  to operate on either gasoline or an alternative fuel such as CNG or Liquefied Petroleum Gas, also known as propane, using one fuel at a time. 11.3.1.2.  Flex-fuel AFVs are capable of using gasoline and an alternative fuel such as E85 (85 percent ethanol and 15 percent gasoline), or a mixture of gasoline and alternative fuel through the same tank/system. 11.3.1.3.  Dedicated AFVs are vehicles that operate solely on an alternative fuel. 11.3.1.4.  EVs operate solely from power stored in a system of batteries. 11.3.1.5.  HEVs  combine  the  benefits  of  gasoline  or  diesel  engines  and  electric  motors.  HEVs can be configured to obtain different objectives, such as improved fuel economy, 260 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 increased  power  or  additional  auxiliary  power  for  electronic  devices  and  power  tools.  PHEVs can be recharged via the electrical grid while the vehicle is not running. 11.3.2.  When purchasing new or leasing vehicles, AF fleet management activities must first consider Zero-Emissions Vehicles (ZEV), AFVs or Flex-Fuel vehicles, low Greenhouse Gas (GHG)  emitting  vehicles,  Hybrid  Electric  Vehicles  (HEV)  and  LSVs  (refer  to  paragraph 11.3.7.  for  additional  low  GHG  emitting  vehicle  procurement  information).    (T-0).    Before requesting new AFVs, AF fleet management activities must first consider the ability to meet mission  requirements,  availability  of  alternative  fuel  infrastructure  (either  on  base  or  in  the local area), the incremental cost of HEVs, PHEVs, and whether low GHG emitting vehicles are available to meet the requirement.  (T-0). Note:  If alternative fuel infrastructure is not available for use in the local area, then AF fleet management activities will not request Flex-Fuel vehicles and will acquire low GHG, HEV, PEV or PHEV when applicable, IAW current policies.  (T-0). 11.3.3.  If  AFVs  or  the  infrastructure  to  support  them  are  not  available,  the  vehicles  listed below are to be considered for purchase (in the following order) after AFVs: 1)  Low GHG 2)  HEV or PHEV. 3)  LSV. 4)  Conventional vehicles (diesel engine propelled is preferable over gasoline if biodiesel (B20) is available locally).  When purchasing diesel vehicles, B20 capable vehicles must be purchased when available.  (T-1). Note:  When acquiring diesel engine propelled vehicles that will utilize B20, be sure the Special Equipment Options, or “SEO”, for engines capable of using B20 is noted. 11.3.4.  DELETED. 11.3.4.1.  Purchasing and leasing functions will acquire law enforcement and emergency-use  AFVs  or  low  GHG  vehicles,  if  such  vehicles  are  capable  of  meeting  mission requirements.  (T-0). 11.3.5.  When renting/leasing vehicles, installation Vehicle Management will ensure that long-term rental/lease requests (see Chapter 4) meet EPAct and EO 13423 requirements for each requesting base.  (T-0).  All AFV rental/lease incremental cost will be surcharged across the entire fleet IAW EPAct 2005, Title VII, Subtitle A, Sec. 702.  (T-0). 11.3.6.  Once procured, AFVs count as credits toward EPAct  requirements.  441 VSCOS is encouraged  to  assign  AFVs  where  infrastructure  is  available  or  the  AFVs  can  be  used  to leverage potential infrastructure. 11.3.7.  AFV  acquisitions  in  MSAs  and  for  vehicle  acquisitions  in  Non-MSAs.    Ensure  the vehicle  with  highest  GHG  score  is  obtained  that  meets  mission  requirements.    Refer  to  the following  EPA  website  for  specific  vehicle  GHG/Air  Pollution  Score  and  complete  GHG Guide:  http://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/. Note:  AFI 90-1701 states all new vehicle purchases shall be low greenhouse gas emitting light duty and medium duty passenger vehicles.  (T-1).  If no such vehicle is available to meet the functional need, the acquiring organization must obtain a waiver from AF/A4. AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 261 11.4.  Exemptions.  EPAct  1992  Section  303(b)  (3)  exempts  most  law  enforcement  vehicles, emergency vehicles and vehicles used for military purposes (for national security reasons) from AFV  acquisition  requirements.    441  VSCOS  will  serve  as  the  clearinghouse  for  exemption requests, exemption data collection and exemption reporting.  (T-1). 11.4.1.  A law enforcement vehicle may be: 11.4.1.1.  Any vehicle which is (1) specifically approved in an agency’s appropriation act for  use  in  apprehension,  pursuit,  patrol  or  protection,  or  is  routinely  used  for  other  law enforcement activities such as surveillance, or (2) covered by the current version of Item 17 or Item 17A, Federal Standard Number 122, published by GSA. 11.4.1.2.  A rental/leased vehicle equipped with at least the following components (1) for passenger automobiles, heavy-duty electrical, cooling and suspension systems and at least the next more powerful engine than is standard for the automobile concerned, or (2) for light trucks, emergency warning lights or identification or markings such as “police”. 11.4.1.3.  An unmarked vehicle which is certified by the SECAF as essential for the safe and  efficient  performance  of  intelligence,  counterintelligence,  protective  or  other  law enforcement duties. 11.4.2.  An  emergency  vehicle  is  any  vehicle  that  is  legally  authorized  by  a  government authority to exceed the speed limit to transport people and/or equipment to and from a situation in  which  speed  is  required  to  save  lives  or  property,  such  as  a  rescue  vehicle,  fire  truck  or ambulance. 11.4.3.  Vehicles used for military purposes (exempt for national security reasons): 11.4.3.1.  Vehicles  defined  as  “tactical  vehicles”  are  automatically  exempt  from  EPAct AFV requirements and a national security exemption need not be claimed for them.  LDVs similar  to  those  driven  by  the  general  public  are  also  automatically  exempt  as  tactical vehicles  if  the  vehicles  have  been  modified  (such  as  the  addition  of  a  24-volt  electrical system)  to  meet  military  specifications,  unless  the  vehicle  is  normally  used  as  an administrative vehicle. 11.4.3.2.  Administrative  vehicles  that  may  have  to  be  deployed  as  part  of  a  military operation will not automatically receive a national security exemption.  Many vehicles can operate on alternative fuel when performing their administrative missions at home station and operate on a petroleum-based fuel when deployed as part of a military operation.  A national  security  exemption  must  be  claimed  for  such  a  vehicle  only  when  there  is substantial  possibility  that  the  vehicle  will  be  deployed,  and  the  vehicle  could  not  be deployed if it was an AFV or the AFV attributes of the vehicle would negatively affect performance of its mission when deployed. Section 11C—Infrastructure 11.5.  Funding.  Funding  for  development  of  on-base  alternative  fuel  infrastructure  is  limited.  EPAct 2005 mandates that agencies arrange for fueling of AFVs at commercial, federally and/ or publicly accessible facilities to the maximum extent practical.  If such a station exists or is planned, AFVs are required to use a station if it is located within 5 miles or 15 minutes from the vehicle‘s garaged location on the installation IAW EPAct 2005.  (T-0).  Locating alternative fuels for any 262 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 can be done location at: http://www.afdc.energy.gov/afdc/fuels/stations.html or to access from a smart phone or PDA use http://www.afdc.energy.gov/afdc/locator/m/stations/. the  DOE  Alternative  Fuel  Site  Locator using 11.5.1.  If  a  commercial  station  proves  impractical  in  terms  of  fuel  costs,  vehicle  wear  and manpower, a very advantageous means of acquiring fueling capability is through: 11.5.1.1.  DLA funded infrastructure. 11.5.1.1.1.  DLA Energy is responsible to fund for new fuels infrastructure holding fuel capitalized  by  the  Defense  Working  Capital  Fund  IAW  DODD  4140.25,  DoD Management Policy for Energy Commodities and Related Services, 12 April 2004. 11.5.1.1.2.  Vehicle Management will identify fuel requirements to Fuels Management by grade, expected annual consumption and total vehicle fuel tank capacity.  (T-1). 11.5.1.1.3.  Fuels Management will analyze the base infrastructure and submit an AF Form 332 to CES establishing the requirement for additional infrastructure based on the requirement for the total storage required by grade and type of fuel IAW Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC).  (T-1). 11.5.1.1.4.  CES  will  assess  parking,  traffic,  tankage  and  dispensing  equipment identified  by  Fuels  Management  IAW  UFC  3-460-01,  Design:  Petroleum  Fuel Facilities,  and  CES  guidance.    (T-1).    The  CES  will  prepare  cost  estimates  and programming  documentation  for  submission  to  the  Air  Force  Petroleum  Agency (AFPA) and the DLA Energy office IAW DLA Energy programming guidance.  (T-1). 11.5.2.  DELETED. Section 11D—Alternative Fuel 11.6.  Alternative Fuel Usage.  Section 701 of the EPAct 2005 requires Federal agencies to use only alternative fuel in all of its dual fueled vehicles—such as ethanol flex-fuel vehicles (FFVs) or bi-fuel gasoline/gaseous fuel vehicles—except where the vehicles have received a waiver from the U.S. Department of Energy.  The Section 701 requirement applies to all AFVs in the U.S. and Puerto Rico in Federal fleets covered by EPAct 1992.  Waivers will be submitted by June 30th each  year  to  the  Department  of  Energy  via  the  Federal  Automotive  Statistical  Tool  web  based program. 11.6.1.  If alternative fuel is available for an AF owned or rented/leased AFV (can be obtained within a 15-minute drive or within five miles one way from the vehicle‘s garaged location) from a commercial off base alternative fuel station or another agency, then alternative fuel will be used 100 percent of the time.  (T-0). 11.6.2.  If an installation has a nearby public or private alternative fuel station but no formal agreement  has  been  established  for  its  use,  the  installation  will  establish  an  economically advantageous use agreement, as described in paragraph 11.5.2.  (T-0). 11.6.3.  If an AFV is frequently driven off base for substantial distances, it is to be refueled at alternative fuel stations to the greatest extent practical.  (T-0).  Such vehicles must always be equipped with a regional map or directory of appropriate alternative fuel stations.  (T-0). AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 263 11.6.4.  If the only available alternative fuel is on the commercial market, a DOD Fleet Fuel Card  will  be  used  to  fuel  AF  owned  vehicles.    (T-1).    If  this  scenario  becomes  necessary, establish  procedures  to  ensure  the  fuel  is  uploaded  into  OLVIMS  as  an  off-base  fuels transaction.  If the appropriate alternative fuel is available on base, the VIL key or AIM2™ Module will be coded so only the alternative fuel can be utilized.  (T-0). 11.6.4.1.  Some vehicles, for example bi-fuel Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), require a minimum amount of gasoline to be used periodically.  In this case, VIL keys or AIM2™ Modules for those types of vehicles may be encoded with  all fuel  types  utilized by that particular vehicle, provided fuel requirement documentation is maintained in the vehicle’s Vehicle Historical File. 11.6.5.  VFM/VMS will clearly and conspicuously identify all flexible fuel vehicles to vehicle operators.  (T-0). 11.6.5.1.  This  must be accomplished using a sticker affixed near the  fuel gauge or fuel tank filler neck combined with a yellow fuel cap or other noticeable methods of indicating that the vehicle will be fueled with the appropriate alternative fuel whenever practical.  (T-0). 11.6.6.  Vehicles that have not submitted for waiver under the EPAct 2005, Section 701 shall also have a map in the vehicle that indicates the location of all available alternative fueling infrastructure within five miles or 15 minutes of their normal operating location.  There are several including: http://www.afdc.energy.gov/afdc/stations/find_station.php. sources for such maps, 11.6.7.  VFM/VMS will develop and implement a communication/training plan to ensure all vehicle operators understand the policy requirement to procure/use the appropriate alternative fuel.    (T-1).    Vehicle  Management  will  periodically  check  the  data  available  to  ensure  this policy is being followed.  (T-1).  Vehicle Management will also assess/reassess alternative fuel source availability on the local economy at least annually.  (T-0).  For suggestions on how to track alternative fuel consumption, contact 441 VSCOS. 11.7.  Biodiesel (B20). 11.7.1.  B20 is not an alternative fuel, but is classified by the DLA Energy as a special fuel which aids DOD agencies by automatically reducing dependency on foreign oil by 20 percent.  B20 is a fuel blend consisting of 20-volume percent biodiesel and 80-volume percent diesel fuel  (grades  DL1/DL2  or  LS1/LS2)  that  can  be  used  in  lieu  of  diesel  fuel  in  compression ignition  engines.    The  use  of  B20  not  only  provides  an  automatic  20  percent  fossil  fuel reduction, it also reduces air emissions and gives us credit towards the EPAct 75 percent AFV acquisition mandate.  One energy credit can be obtained by the use of 2,250 gallons of B20 in diesel engine driven vehicles weighing more than 8,500 pounds. 11.7.2.  The use of B20 is essential in the AF's efforts to reduce its dependency on foreign oil.  Regardless of the warranty implications, the AF mandates that B20 be used to the maximum extent possible.  (T-1).  If a warranty condition develops due to the use of B20, then report the failure via the VM Neighborhood so failures can be tracked and trends analyzed.  Be sure to coordinate failure reports with the local fuels management activity to ensure that no problems exist with the quality of B20 at the refueling station.  Warranty repair costs that are not covered by the dealer will be absorbed by the local vehicle management activity.  (T-1). 264 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 11.7.2.1.  VFM/VMS may, to the minimum extent practical, authorize select specialized vehicles/equipment  be  exempt  from  the  use  of  B20  IAW  TO  42B1-1-1,  AFPA  Fuels Technical  Letter  11-03  and  this  AFI.    The  VFM/VMS  will  validate  exemptions  during initial issue and subsequent re-issues of VIL keys using a locally generated memorandum and placing it in the active portion of the vehicle record jacket.  (T-1).  Vehicles already considered exempt from EPAct 2005 Section 701 requirements are also exempt from B20 requirements. 11.7.3.  Additional information on B20 can be found in TO 42B1-1-1, Fuels for USAF Piston and  Turbine  Support  Equipment  and  Administrative  Vehicles  and  AFPA  Fuels  Technical Letter (FTL) 11-03, Handling of Alternative Ground Fuels- Biodiesel Blends and Ethanol Fuel Blends for Flexible-Fuel Vehicles. Section 11E—Environmental Programs 11.8.  Environmental Quality Program.  AFPD 32-70, Environmental Quality, provides overall policy guidance associated with the AF’s Environmental Quality Program.  As stated in this policy directive, “The Air Force is committed to:  Cleaning up environmental damage resulting from its past activities; meeting all environmental standards applicable to its present operations; planning its future activities to  minimize environmental impacts; managing responsibly the irreplaceable natural and cultural resources it holds in public trust; and eliminating pollution from its activities wherever possible.”  All AF functions are required to comply with the AF environmental quality program, and as such, Vehicle Management activities incur certain environmental responsibilities, to include, but not limited to: 11.8.1.  The Clean Air Act (CAA) and CAA Amendments of 1990.  These acts deal with atmospheric  pollution  and  are  implemented  at  the  federal,  state  and  local  level.    The  major areas of concern for Vehicle Management under this legislation are vehicle exhaust emissions and  ozone  depleting  chemicals  such  as  Chlorofluorocarbons  (CFC)-12  air  conditioning refrigerants. 11.8.1.1.  CAA Section 118(c), 42 U.S.C. § 7418, requires federal fleet vehicles, excluding tactical  vehicles  (refer  to  paragraph  1.1.1.2),  to  comply  with  valid  state  and  local principality inspection and maintenance programs for Ozone and Carbon Monoxide.  For more details, refer to AFI 32-7040, Air Quality Compliance And Resource Management. 11.8.1.1.1.  The VFM/VMS must cooperate with the state to test Federal fleet vehicles and submit applicable reports.  (T-0).  Exclude military tactical vehicles and any other vehicles  exempted  under  state  law.    These  may  include,  for  example,  emergency vehicles, AFVs and certain newer model years. 11.8.1.2.  Vehicle  emission control devices/components  will be maintained according to technical directives/manufacturer‘s recommendations, and inspected as part of the PM&I or  when  a  major  tune-up  is  accomplished.    (T-1).    As  applicable,  Vehicle  Management activities will ensure state, local or host country directed emissions testing requirements are  completed.    (T-0).    Emissions  testing/use  of  exhaust  gas  analyzers  may  be performed/used  as  part  of  the  troubleshooting  process  regardless  of  state,  local  or  host country testing requirements. AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 265 11.8.1.2.1.  Maintain  results  of  state, local  or  host  nation  directed  vehicle emission/diagnostic  tests  in  the  active  section  of  the  vehicle  historical  record  until rescinded through replacement by a current test.  Documentation will reflect the status of the vehicle emission system (pass/fail) to include work order number and date the test was performed.  (T-1). 11.8.2.  40 CFR  Part 82, Subpart B, Servicing of Motor Vehicle Air Conditioners, current edition.    This  law  establishes  standards  and  requirements  for  servicing  MVAC.

Modifications  are identified as capability or sustainment modifications and can be either temporary or permanent.  All modifications must be coordinated through a formal configuration review/control process and implemented in accordance with AF publications.  (T-1).  MRAP modifications must be submitted to the ACC/A4RE MRAP Weapon System Team for staffing.  Additional information, terms and guidance  governing  AF  modification  management  is  contained  in  AFI  63-131,  Modification Program  Management,  AFI 63-101, Acquisition and Sustainment  Life Cycle Management,  and AFI 10-601, Operational Capability Requirements Development.  (T-1). 12.7.  Daily  Operations  and  Maintenance  Philosophy.  The  AF  will  utilize  a  combination  of contract logistics support (CLS) and organic maintenance capabilities.  In many cases FSRs will be contracted to perform maintenance and documentation functions.  IMDS will be used to record maintenance discrepancies and activities associated with MRAPs. 12.7.1.  Units operating MRAPs will utilize the Vehicle Control Program and VCO/VCNCO concept to report and coordinate maintenance and management of MRAPs (refer to Chapter 10). 12.7.2.  Vehicle  Management,  or  equivalent,  will  be  the  focal  point  for  overall  MRAP maintenance management. 12.7.3.  The MRAP operator is responsible for accomplishing pre-use inspections to ensure the MRAP is configured properly, all systems are operational and the weapon system is suitable for the mission.  The operator will annotate an MRAP AF Form 1800 identifying any issues with the BVP or MSE.  AF Form 1800 will be provided to Vehicle Management, or equivalent, AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 271 who  in-turn  documents  discrepancies  in  IMDS  for  maintenance  coordination  and  action.  IMDS can generate needed MRAP AFTO Form 781 series forms. 12.7.4.  LRS Vehicle Management, or equivalent, will be the primary focal point for MRAP repair  and  will  initiate  and  clear  maintenance  work  orders  in  IMDS,  assign  priorities  and coordinate  repair  requirements  with  approved  sources  of  repair.    Vehicle  Management  will coordinate  with  approved  FSR/contractor  for  repairs  not  supported  by  organic  maintenance capabilities. 12.7.5.  If  a  maintenance  activity  requires  a  request  for  maintenance  assistance  (RFA)  for evaluation and/or repair beyond unit capability, the request will be made IAW TO 00-25-107-WA-1 and TO 36-1-191. 12.8.  MRAP FoV Forms.  MRAP maintainers/operators will utilize an AF Form 1800 and the AFTO Form781-series forms which include:  AFTO Forms 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document, 781B, Communication Security Equipment Record and 781K, Aerospace Vehicle Inspection,  Engine  Data,  Calendar  Inspection  And  Delayed  Discrepancy  Document.

Forms  can  be  down  loaded  from  the  AF  portal  and  can  be  generated  from  IMDS.  Samples can be seen in TO 00-20-1. 12.8.5.  Vehicle  Management,  or  equivalent,  inputs  discrepancy  and  updates  MC  status  in IMDS and creates an AFTO Form 781 series form for the discrepancy.  Vehicle Management disseminates  jobs  to  the  appropriate  work  centers  for  action.    Vehicle  Management,  or equivalent,  will  maintain  these  vehicle  AFTO  Form  781  series  forms  and  keep  completed forms in MRAP Jacket File. 12.8.6.  The appropriate work centers will complete jobs, sign off the work order in the AFTO Form 781 series forms, return the MRAP and signed AFTO Form 781 series forms to Vehicle Management, or equivalent. 12.8.7.  Vehicle Management, or equivalent, will clear work order in IMDS and update MC status.    Vehicle  Management,  or  equivalent,  will  notify  VCO  of  completion.    The  VCO  is responsible for ensuring pickup of MRAP from Vehicle Management or equivalent. 12.9.  GSU.  Management of MRAP weapons systems located at GSUs pose unique challenges; however,  it  is  imperative  that  all  standard  weapons  systems  management  functions,  to  include daily mission capability status updates, take place. 12.9.1.  All  AF  MRAPs  located  at  a  GSU  are  possessed  as  a  matter-of-record  by  an  AF organization.    The  managing  group  commander,  or  equivalent,  is  responsible  to  ensure  all maintenance management actions and reporting procedures are accomplished. 272 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 Figure 12.1.  MRAP Organizational Maintenance Process 12.10.  Contingency  Operations.  Contingency  operations  bring  a  variety  of  challenges  for management  actions  associated  with  MRAP  weapon  systems.    During  contingency  operations, COCOM staffs, with the Lead Command, will determine the most effective process to meet the primary goal of supporting the war fighter while adhering to weapon systems management policies and  procedures  and  this  AFI.    Policies  and  procedures  must  ensure  asset  accountability, configuration control and mission capability reporting.   JUDITH A.

The focus of the program is to provide vehicle management  functions  the  ability  to  evaluate  commercially  available  off-the-shelf  products  in order to determine if they are more economical and effective in performing vehicle management day-to-day  operations  prior  to  purchasing.    All  products  must  have  potential  tangible  and intangible benefits to the AF, with a focus on enhancing forward deployed vehicle management operations and/or environmental impact mitigation effects, prior to initiating an evaluation. A3.1.1.  All  vendors  participating  in  the  product  evaluation  program  must  be  made  to understand, and acknowledge in writing prior to  any evaluation starting (see note 1 below), that  this  is  a  “no  cost”  program  to  the  US  Government,  DOD  or  AF.    Furthermore,  that  a positive (or negative) product procurement recommendation stated in any evaluation report is written  in  a  way  that  does  not  constitute  a  legal  and  binding  agreement  on  the  AF  to procure/purchase the evaluated product.  Extreme care must be taken by all levels of Vehicle Management activities when corresponding with vendors as to not obligate (intentionally or unintentionally) the AF for evaluated product procurement without proper authority. A3.2.  AF-level  Evaluations.

Coordinate  with  base  POC  to  conduct  an  evaluation  and  determine  on-site support requirements. A3.2.2.4.  Provide project administrative support and guidance to vendors and evaluating units,  to  include:    Bailment  Agreement,  Program  Directive,  evaluation  time-lines  and reporting requirements. Notes: 1.  A “Bailment Agreement” is an agreement between the vendor (bailor) and AF (bailee) which outlines the temporary placement of control over, or possession of, the product to be evaluated by the bailor, into the hands of the bailee, for the designated purpose of evaluation upon which the parties have agreed and at “no cost” to the bailee.  AF level Bailment Agreements must be coordinated through 441 VSCOS for signature by the AF or DoD Executive Agent, for which the program is categorized, and the vendor’s representative prior to product transfer.  The authority to sign as an Executive Agent may be delegated; however, the new agent must be appointed using an AF memorandum.  Three (each) original and signed Bailment Agreements must be completed.  One each will be distributed to the Executive Agent, the vendor and the 300 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 evaluating unit POC.   2.  A “Project Directive” outlines vendor/product information, testing/evaluation parameters and pertinent contact information. A3.2.2.5.  Maintain  official  records  of  all  AF-level  evaluations.    Retain  Bailment Agreement (to include associate documentation) IAW Table and Rule T 64–06 R 03.00 in the AF RDS in AFRIMS. A3.2.2.6.  When necessary, send a 441 VSCOS Project Manager to the evaluation site to start, evaluate and/or close projects. A3.2.2.7.  Prepare disposition recommendations to AF/A4LR based on evaluating unit‘s final report findings, including criteria for AS placement or replacement as required. A3.2.2.8.

Calculated  costs  savings  and  avoidance  that  resulted  from  project evaluation. A3.3.4.7.2.  Intangible benefits. A3.3.4.7.3.  Advantages and disadvantages, to include any safety concerns. A3.3.4.7.4.  Comparison to current item or process used. A3.3.4.7.5.  Work accomplished (how was product evaluated) and discussion. A3.3.4.7.6.  Recommendations. A3.3.4.8.  Review  test  data  before  the  end  of  the  test  to  determine  if  purchase  of  test equipment (in place) is warranted.  If the purchase of the tested equipment is desired, test activities will prepare an AF Form 9 along with a sole source justification and process it through their contracting activity or use a GPC for purchase. A3.3.5.  Other areas of program concern: A3.3.5.1.  441  VSCOS  provides  program  management  guidance to  non-vehicle management organizations or activities (i.e., AFCEC or AFPA).  When a product affects the specifications, and/or characteristics of a specific registered vehicle, 441 VSCOS will be coordinated with prior to product evaluation start. A3.3.5.2.  441  VSCOS  will  participate  in  environmental  and  pollution  prevention workshops and conferences to learn about new products and current automotive industry practices  and  work  to  embed  them  in  Vehicle  Management  processes.    Coordinate proposed  environmental  projects  with  the  AF  Center  for  Engineering  and  the Environmental  (AFCEE/EQP/EQT).    An  Environmental  Impact  Analysis  Process, categorical  exclusion,  environmental  assessment  or  an  environmental  impact  statement might have to be developed for projects having environmental impact.  302 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 Attachment 4 LIMS-EV VEHICLE VIEW A4.1.

A4.4.2.3.2.  “Historical” Fleet Posture views are built using:  ILS-S data; authorization, assigned and excess trend lines; assigned user org, equivalents, status codes, etc. A4.4.2.3.3.  “Current” Fleet Posture views provide an up-to-date look at authorizations and assets assigned and is the primary view used to manage the fleet. A4.4.2.3.3.1.  “Ad-Hoc Reports” allows generation of any type of report to view the fleet.  The Data Tray can be grouped by command, organization, vehicle type, ASC, master management  code,  BPAC and authorized NSN.  The “201”, “214” and  “518”  data  is  from  ILS-S  (show  B200  and  B204).    Ad-Hoc  reporting  also allows Master Management  Code (Authorization) vs. Management Code (Asset) searches. A4.4.2.3.3.2.  Master  Vehicle  Report/Hand  Receipt.    To  produce  this  document select  entire  base,  single  or  multiple  organizations,  then  export  as  pdf  or  Excel document. Note:  The grid will show due-in information but hand receipt does not. A4.4.2.4.  “Sustainment Costs” depicts the cost to sustain the vehicle fleet (registered and total) with a default view by cost and an additional tab for averages.  Seven data points are displayed from OLVIMS data: 1)  LABOR COST: Sum of the TOT DIRECT LABOR COST field of the filter set result. 306 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 2)  PARTS COST: Sum of TOT PARTS COSTS field of the filter result set. 3)  CONTRACT MAINT COST: Sum of CONTRACT MAINT COST and OGA COSTS fields of the filter result set. 4)  ACCIDENT COST: Sum of ACC IN-HOUSE MAT COST field of the filter result set. 5)  ACCIDENT LABOR COST: Sum of ACC IN-HOUSE LABOR COST field of the filter result set. 6)  COST PER MILE: Total of all costs divided by total miles driven of the filter result set. 7)  COST PER VEHICLE: Total of all costs divided by fleet total of the filter result set. A4.4.2.5.  “Utilization” depicts a combination of two group sets to provide a capability to measure  vehicle  utilization  of  a  filtered  result  set  to  the  “AF  Average”.    Calculations limited  to  vehicles  with  an  M/H/U/K  code  of  “M”  or  “K”.    Data  Computations  are  as follows. A4.4.2.5.1.  “Mean” is the average total miles driven per vehicle for the entire period of historical data period selected (not more than 24 months). A4.4.2.5.2.  “Two Standard Deviations”, use of two standard deviations from the mean to establish upper and lower control limits for the AF average. A4.4.2.5.2.1.  “Over  Utilized”  =  more  than  two  standard  deviations  above  the mean. A4.4.2.5.2.2.  “Under  Utilized”  =  more  than  two  standard  deviations  under  the mean. A4.4.2.6.  “Requirements” depicts the number of vehicles required to be replaced over the next 20 years.  Initial view will also depict the vehicles scheduled for purchase (due in).  The view can be switched between “Assets” and “Cost”. A4.4.2.6.1.  The  computations used to establish current life expectancy are as follows: 1)  Life expectancy in years is computed by taking the depreciated value of each vehicle over a 20-year life span and plotting it against O&M costs, which are increased yearly by three percent (for inflation). 2)  Establish the life in years at the point where projected O&M costs exceed the depreciated value or at 20 years. A4.4.2.7.  Due-Ins.  This view shows due-in information by vehicle quantity, actual dollars and by fund type.  Due-in data is from CARS. A4.4.3.  TCTO.  This  view  depicts  four  separate  but  linked  TCTO  requirements  by  vehicle counts.  The available data views are by vehicle numbers and percent completed.  By toggling between the views, the viewer can get an informed look at an individual TCTO or the status of a larger TCTO program completion level within a filter set.  TCTO numbers are generated on a reference table and TCTO number in OLVIMS must match TCTO number listed in LIMS-EV  VEHICLE  VIEW.    OLVIMS  data  is  crossed  in  monthly  file  uploaded  to  441  VSCOS (VYHK0D2T.ZIP).  If TCTO data in OLVIMS is incorrect, FM&A must edit “C record” in OLVIMS to match (CZ, CV, ZH transactions).  The following are data points and definitions are used to build this view: AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 307 A4.4.3.1.  Total required:  depicts the sum vehicles required to have a TCTO completed on them within the filter set.  Source of the vehicle count is a sum of the registration numbers listed in the TCTO table that matches the filter set. A4.4.3.2.  Complete:  depicts the sum of vehicle registration numbers listed within the filter set that have a TCTO COMPLETED DATE listed. A4.4.3.3.  Due/On-Time:  depicts the sum of vehicle registration numbers in the result set that require a TCTO be completed that have not passed the “MUST BE DONE DATE”.  Will  be  reflected  when  within  60  days  of  due  date.    Individuals  can  toggle  between numerical values or percentages in the chart. A4.4.3.4.  Overdue:  depicts the sum of vehicle registration numbers in the result set that require a TCTO be completed that has passed the “MUST BE DONE DATE”. A4.4.4.  Force  Module.    This  module  depicts  total  vehicles  available  to  sustain  the  vehicle force modules of “Open,” “Establish”, “Operate” or “Robust a base”.  This module mirrors the Leadership View display, but shows actual assets and bases.  Filter options allow selection of organization level and type of mission to support.  Select chart option to fill the data grid with vehicle requirements, drill down vehicle requirements to view asset information. A4.4.4.1.  Data Source.  Package requirements are defined in the Force Module table and fill rate/capability data is extracted from the “WRK.CMD” file.  308 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 Attachment 5 CAPABILITY BASED FUNDING AND VEHICLE PRIORITIZATION MODEL A5.1.  Capability Based Funding.  A process used to capture logistics requirements.  Quantifying vehicle/vehicular equipment requirements is key to raising the pursuit of funding from a gray area to a meaningful discussion of capability. A5.1.1.  Programming is establishing a plan of action to do something.  In the vehicle world this is planning our vehicle requirements in future years. A5.1.2.  Execution is when we carry out those plans with the funding available. A5.2.  Funding Source. A5.2.1.  Funding is appropriated by Congress for vehicle procurement through appropriation bills.  Appropriated funds categories are: A5.2.1.1.  3010 Aircraft Procurement, Air Force. A5.2.1.2.  3080  Procurement–Other  (munitions,  vehicles,  electronics,  base  maintenance and support equipment).  This is three-year money. A5.2.1.3.  3400 Operations and Maintenance, Air Force.  This is one-year money. A5.2.2.  In the past, 3400 and 3080 money was used for vehicle procurement, now only 3080 money is used for vehicle procurement. A5.2.2.1.  3400 is discretionary money and is not designated for a specific purpose.  This funding is easy to target for funding cuts when Air Staff or MAJCOM has higher priorities; hard to defend requirements. A5.2.2.2.  3080  money  is  allocated  for  specific  requirements.    This  type  of  funding  is harder to target for cuts or divert elsewhere, unless mission is higher priority. A5.2.3.  The “Color of Money”. A5.2.3.1.  Appropriated  money  is  further  defined  by  Budget  Program  Activity  Codes (BPAC).  BPAC classifications “below the appropriation level” are used to identify major budget programs, or in relation to vehicles, the type of vehicle the funding supports.  The following are vehicle BPACs: 1)1800 – General Purpose Vehicles. 2)2230 – Medium Tactical Vehicles (All M-Series vehicles). 3)2990 – Cargo and Utility Vehicles. 4)3230 – HMMWV. 5)4010 – Fire Fighting Vehicles. 6)5990 – Material Handling. 7)6210 – Runway Snow Removal. 8)6990 – Base Maintenance and Construction. A5.2.4.  AF Vehicle Fleet Major/Minor Program Codes (refer to paragraph 4.75) are used to link authorization (and vehicles) to the specific mission they are used to support.  They also allow for analysis to determine what missions are being supported by the money.  For a listing of vehicle program/mission codes refer to Tables 4.5 and  4.6 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 309 A5.3.  DELETED A5.4.  Vehicle Prioritization Model. A5.4.1.  Overview.  A given vehicle type is only in one BPAC, but can be at any base within a MAJCOM or AF fleet.  Funds allocated to each vehicle NSN are split among all vehicles and vacancies  within  that  NSN.    The  model  calculates  End  of  Life  (EOL)  year  based  on depreciation of the vehicle and cumulative sustainment (O&M) costs.  Depreciation is based on a default life expectancy of 20 years.  EOL is adjusted, or set, when O&M cost exceeds depreciation value.  Vehicles with same Management code will have different life expectancies for programming purposes.  The Vehicle Prioritization Model provides better justification for appropriations  and  is  a  proven  business  model  that  identifies  vehicle  requirements  while connecting them with the mission they support. Note:  Vehicle One-time Repair Limits and Replacement Codes should only be used for maintenance decisions. A5.4.2.  Model Logic. A5.4.2.1.  Vehicles and vacancies are prioritized within BPACs and NSNs. A5.4.2.1.1.  Prioritizes  all  assets  assigned  from  1  –  many,  whether  replacement required or not. A5.4.2.1.2.  Does not attempt to prioritize one vehicle type over another or one BPAC over another. A5.4.2.1.3.  Does not attempt to prioritize vehicles and vacancies together. A5.4.2.1.4.  Apply the funding: 1)  Applies funding across NSNs in a BPAC. 2)  Determines NSN earned share based on health rate. 3)  Determines vehicle/vacancy split (2:1). 4)  Apply funds to prioritized lists. A5.4.2.2.  Prioritization Rules for Vehicle Replacement. A5.4.2.2.1.  Use Code: non-WRM (A/J, B/K, C/L) first, WRM last (D/M). A5.4.2.2.2.  Year: Ascending – oldest first. A5.4.2.2.3.  Use Code: A/J first, B/K and C/L second, D/M last. A5.4.2.2.4.  End of Life: Ascending – projected end of life year.  Vehicles exceeding or nearing their end of life year are replaced first. A5.4.2.2.5.  Miles or Hours: Descending – cumulative miles or hours. A5.4.2.2.6.  Sustainment Cost: Descending – higher maintenance cost before low. A5.4.2.2.7.  Item Code: Unsuitable substitutes first, all others second. A5.4.2.2.8.  Base Fleet Age: Descending – the average age of the fleet for all NSNs at each base (prioritizes assets that are equal in every other way between bases). A5.4.2.2.9.  Last 6 digits of registration number: Ascending – a random number will be used for tiebreak. 310 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 A5.4.2.3.  Prioritization Rules for Vacancies. A5.4.2.3.1.  Use Code: A/J (mobility) first, B/K and C/L second, D/M (WRM) last. A5.4.2.3.2.  Vacancy Rate: Descending – percentage of vacancies to authorizations at a location.  More vacancies – higher priority. A5.4.2.3.3.  Replaced  eligible  rate:  Descending  –  percentage  of  replacement  eligible vehicles to authorizations.  Higher percentage of replacement eligible vehicles – higher priority. A5.4.2.3.4.  Fleet  Age:  Descending  –  average  age  of  the  fleet  for  each  NSN  at  each base. A5.4.2.3.5.  Base Fleet Age: Descending – the average age of the fleet for all NSNs at each base (prioritizes assets that are equal in every other way between bases). A5.4.2.3.6.  Authorization  Number:  Descending  –  positions  7-18  of  authorization number (doc number + SRAN).  A random number will be used for tiebreak. A5.4.2.4.  Funding Rules. A5.4.2.4.1.  Can select how many out-years to include in the plan. A5.4.2.4.2.  A percentage of funds can be withheld.  Needed to accommodate a flex line between listed Standard Price and actual price with options. A5.4.2.4.3.  No  Buy  list  can  be  created  for  any  combination  of  NSN,  BPAC, MAJCOM, Base and/or FY. A5.4.2.4.4.  Must Buy list can be created by NSN, MAJCOM and FY. A5.4.2.4.5.  Replacement Required Carryover Percentage (RRCP). 1)  Accepted historical replacement eligible percentage by NSN. 2)  VPM will prioritize up to that percentage for a NSN and then stop until all NSNs reach their RRCP. 3)  VPM then continues to prioritize equally for all NSNs. A5.4.2.4.6.  441 VSCOS uses the VPM to adjust programming for BPACs in out years.  This allows them to see if there is too much/little money within a BPAC.  Money cannot be moved in execution year.  Programming lists are not saved in the system. A5.4.2.4.7.  “What if” scenarios may be run throughout the year to identify and adjust buy requirements. A5.4.2.4.8.  The system is locked on predetermined date to generate prioritization list for execution.  Execution list are saved in the system and generate metrics for analysis.  Base level VM activities can run the model with “what if” scenarios. AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 311 Figure A5.1.  LIMS-EV Vehicle View, Prioritization Tab/Baseline Model Run Example   312 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 Attachment 6 DOD FLEET CARD PROGRAM A6.1.  Overview.  DOD Fleet Cards are used to obtain fuel and services from off-base commercial service  stations  when  the  vehicle  is  operating  outside  of  the  using  organization‘s  Permissible Operating Distance (POD).  The cards are not credit cards, e.g., VISA® or MasterCard®, and are only accepted at participating businesses.  Dependent on individual unit account policy, purchases other items or services other than fuel may be authorized and will be limited to those which are needed in order keep a USAF vehicle in (or return to) serviceable condition. A6.1.1.  AF controlled vehicles authorized for off-base use may be assigned a DOD Fleet Card if the vehicle is normally operated outside of the base‘s POD or if an authorized DOD or AF base refueling facility (that utilizes the Vehicle Identification Link Key) is not available. A6.1.2.  To  facilitate  multi-vehicle  fuel  purchases,  each  vehicle  management,  or  account activity, is authorized to obtain generic cards. A6.2.  General Policy. A6.2.1.  Card users will be briefed to make every effort to purchase fuel from pumps with card reader (“swiping”) capability. A6.2.2.  Card users will not purchase premium fuels (e.g., premium or super unleaded.) A6.2.2.1.  Exceptions:  1) Fuel for watercraft motors/marine engines; 2) When required in writing by the vehicle manufacture, e.g., the Chevrolet Volt. A6.2.2.2.  Assets meeting an exception above will have individual fuel card created for use by the assets in question only.  The new fuel card will be created to include the appropriate optional  embossing,  e.g.,  "[registration/tag  number/unit]  Premium  Fuel"  or  "Watercraft Premium Fuel", whichever is applicable; variations authorized. A6.2.2.3.  AO will investigate all unauthorized premium fuel purchases and advise cards users/organization  in  writing  of  the  premium  fuel  purchase  policy,  and  retain  copy  in program management file. A6.2.3.  All fuel cards will reflect account name, i.e., 96th Vehicle Management. A6.2.4.  Vehicle management or account holder activities will maintain as few fuel cards as possible to ensure mission accomplishment. A6.2.5.  The  base-level  vehicle  management  or  account  holder  activities  may  set  policy restricting Fleet card purchases to ”FUEL ONLY”. A6.2.5.1.  Car  wash  purchase  amount  limits  may  also  be  set  by  base-level  Vehicle Management activities, e.g., $15 per car wash. A6.2.6.  Fuel cards  will not to be used in place of an organization‘s GPC program, the use of an AF Form 9, Request for Purchase or other purchasing instrument when purchasing items or services required in support of field operations or fleet maintenance. A6.2.7.  Fuel cards  will not be used to support “wet” leased vehicles at any time.  Contact GSA for guidance concerning on GSA leased vehicle cards. AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 313 A6.2.8.  Fuel cards can be used to obtain fuel for small boats, tugs or barges as authorized by the AFCPM and not to exceed the $3,000 micro-purchase threshold. A6.2.9.  Fuel cards are not authorized to obtain aviation fuel. A6.2.10.  LRS Commanders or equivalents have the option of establishing alternative off-base refueling  programs  using  the  DOD  Fleet  Card  Program  when  alternative  fuel  requirements cannot be met by local fuels management agencies and/or supported by other federal agencies (refer to paragraph 11.6). A6.2.10.1.  If cards are required to support commercially available alternative fuel, these cards will be restricted to “FUEL ONLY” purchases. A6.2.10.2.  If individual cards are obtained to support specific vehicle(s), these cards will have the vehicle registration number and alternative fuel optionally embossed on the card (e.g., 11B12345 E-85).  Additionally, these cards will be programmed with the fuel funding line-of-accounting (LOA) belonging to the vehicle‘s assigned organization. Note:  Fuel funding LOAs are established by Accounting and Finance and contain Department of Defense Activity Address Code (DODAAC), Signal Code, Fund Code and Supply Account Codes which are used to charge organizational O&M funding lines for fuel purchases.    These codes are also found on individual vehicle VIL keys. A6.2.11.  FM&A must establish procedures with Accountable Officials (AO) (if not from an LRS  Vehicle  Management  account)  and  card  users  to  ensure  the  information  required  for OLVIMS off-base fuel transaction are provided in a timely fashion. A6.2.12.  When  fuel  cards  are  assigned/hand-receipted  to  support  non-UDI  or  account assigned vehicles, the AO will ensure that funds for fuel purchases are reimbursed to the fuel card  account‘s  fuel  funding  LOA.    Additionally,  AOs  will  restrict  purchases  to  “FUEL ONLY”. A6.2.13.  When not in use, cards will be stored in a suitable locked container. A6.2.14.  AOs  will  establish  policy  and  procedure  for  card  users  to  follow  for  obtaining approval  from  the  account  AO  or  Certifying  Official  (CO)  before  using  a  card  to  obtain commercial maintenance or towing services. A6.2.15.  APCs,  AO,  CO  and  alternates  must  establish  and  maintain  on-line  account management  access  with  the  credit  card  vendor.    On-line  account  management  (WEX Online®) will allow APCs transaction oversight and AOs/COs the ability to retrieve monthly invoices, set-up purchase “alerts”, quickly view status of account(s), card(s) used and to verify transactions  against  their  account(s).    APCs  will  only  be  able  to  view  account  under  their MAJCOM hierarchy. A6.2.16.  Use of “Prepay” is not authorized.  Card users must locate another authorized vendor that does not have prepaid fuel.  If this is not possible/practical to locate or travel to a non-prepay vendor, card user will underestimate fuel amount needed to ensure there are is not an "unused"  dollar  amount,  or  purchase  the  minimal  amount  of  fuel  needed  to  locate  another authorized  vendor  that  does  not  require  fuel  purchase  “prepay”.    Unused  portion  of  prepay amount  must  be  credited  back  to  account.    Receiving  cash  as  change  for  a  prepay  fuel transaction is not authorized. 314 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 A6.3.  Above  the  Unit  Level  Program  Management  Positions.  DLA  Energy  is  the  DOD Program Manager for the DOD Fleet Card Program; establishing policy, providing oversight and managing account  fuel  transactions, however units will develop,  and ensure execution  of, local programs and procedures IAW with the DLA Energy sponsored fuel charge card guidelines and this AFI. A6.3.1.  AFCPM.  On behalf of AF/A4LR, 441 VSCOS acts as the AFCPM.  As such, 441 VSCOS  is  responsible  for  supporting  DOD  Fleet  Card  Program  policy,  establishing  and enforcing AF policy and providing a bridge between unit-level accounts and outside agencies; such as DLA Energy, the fuel card vendor and the Defense Finance and Accounting System.  Additionally, 441 VSCOS provides account oversight, operational and program management support for non-fuel purchases.  441 VSCOS is also responsible to maintain a master listing of all accounts, to include (with the assistance of APCs) up-to-date unit-level account AO/POC information. A6.3.2.  APC  (ANG  and  AFRC  Only).    Like  the  AFCPM,  APCs  can  also  act  as  a  bridge between  accounts  and  outside  agencies.    They  are  also  responsible  for  the  oversight  and enforcement  of  AF  Fleet  Card  Program  policy.    This  is  usually  accomplished  via  Staff Assistance and as program management checklist items on the HAF SAC.  APCs will maintain a list of accounts and AO (POC) information for accounts under their command. A6.4.  Unit  Level  Program  Management  Positions.  Normally,  the  Vehicle  Management activity is responsible for administration of the DOD Fleet Card Program/account.  Appropriate personnel  within  the  account‘s  controlling  activity/flight  will  be  appointed  (via  DD  Form  577, Appointment/Termination Record – Authorized Signature, Sections I thru III, refer to paragraph A6.4.3) to the following positions: A6.4.1.  AO.  This person is responsible for overall account management, to include, but not limit to: A6.4.1.1.  Supporting the certification of payment invoices and documents for vendor non-fuel payment.  Supporting the respective CO with timely and accurate data/information to ensure  prompt  and  proper  payments,  i.e.,  payments  that  are  supportable,  legal  and computed correctly. A6.4.1.2.  Ensuring fuel cards are distributed for use only to authorized vehicles. A6.4.1.3.  Ensuring that a system of internal procedures and controls for the portion of the entitlement and/or payment-related process under their cognizance is in place to minimize opportunities  for  erroneous  or  delinquent  payments.    Additionally,  ensure  that  all procedural safeguards affecting proposed payments are observed. A6.4.1.4.  Complying  with  OMB  Circular  A-123,  Appendix  B  and  all  applicable  DOD regulations and AF policy and procedures. A6.4.2.  CO.  The CO position would normally be held by the flight OIC, VFM, VMS, FM&A NCOIC  or  unit  RA.    However,  small  units/functions  with  limited  supervisory  personnel authorizations may designate the unit commander, COR or contracting officer (for contracted vehicle management activities) as the CO.  The CO ensures all non-fuel purchases made with DOD Fleet Cards has funding available for payment.  COs also signs/certifies the SF 1034 for non-fuel payments. AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 315 Note:  Additional responsibilities for the positions above can be found in DOD 4140.25-M, DOD Management of Bulk Petroleum Products, Natural Gas, and Coal, Vol II, Chapter 16, Government Fuel Card Program Management Office, 26 February 2009. A6.4.3.  All unit level program management position appointments will be made by the unit commander or appointing authority utilizing a DD Form 577. Note:  The use of a memorandum to appoint personnel into program management positions is at the discretion of unit-level management.  However, this does not negate completion and disposition of DD Form 577. A6.4.3.1.  AOs also require completion of the Fleet DOD/DLA Energy AO Nomination Form. A6.4.3.2.  AOs and COs must complete DLA Energy AO Training (refer to  paragraph A6.12.). A6.4.4.  Alternates will also  be  appointed for each position and have the same appointment form requirements as stated above. A6.4.5.  The signed DD Form 577, AO Nomination Form and AO training Certificate must be forwarded to the DLA Energy AF Fuel Account Manager and/or AFCPM and maintained in the account program management binder/file. A6.4.6.  The DD Form 577 for the account’s CO must be forwarded to DFAS-IN to  ensure non-fuel payment acceptance/processing. Notes: 1.  The AFCPM maintains template AO and CO DD Form 577 with program responsibilities (block 14) and program management directives (block 15) prefilled: this is the only form that will be accepted.  Go to the VM Neighborhood to attain a write-capable electronic version. 2.  Upon termination of program management position responsibilities, DD Form 577, Section IV, must be completed and forwarded the DLA Energy AF Account Manager and/or AFCPM and maintained in the account program management binder/file. 3.  COs and AOs perform inherently governmental functions such as activities that require making value judgments regarding monetary transactions and entitlement involving the collection, control, or disbursement of appropriated and other Federal funds.  Therefore, these functions must be performed by U.S. Federal government employees, not contractors. 4.  DD Form 577 appointments remain in force until terminated by an appointee’s reassignment or for cause.  An appointing authority’s reassignment does not affect existing appointments. A6.5.  Establishing DOD Fleet Card Account.  Units must contact the AFCPM for details.  (T-1). A6.5.1.  DLA Energy will not establish new accounts without the AFCPM approval. A6.6.  DOD Fleet Card Split Billing Process: A6.6.1.  Split  billing  is  a  means  of  centrally  billing  the  “fuel”  portion  of  the  invoice.    Split Billing  functionality  is  the  process  whereby  fuel  purchases  are  separated  from  non-fuel purchases.    The  fuel  card  processor  (Wright  Express©  (WEX),  the  DOD  Fleet  Fuel  Card contractor) is responsible for separating fuel purchases from non-fuel purchases (splitting the invoice). 316 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 A6.6.2.  For the fuel portion, DLA Energy-RRF (San Antonio) acts as the certifying office and Defense Finance & Accounting Service (DFAS) Columbus is the paying office. A6.6.3.  For the non-fuel portion, each incurring unit (account) is the certifying office, and the appropriate DFAS office for the unit is the paying office.  Individual accounts will continue processing the non-fuel  portion of their invoice from the fleet  card  contractor through their established channels(refer to paragraph A6.8). A6.7.  The FMD and the EBS: A6.7.1.  The FMD, a component of Business Systems Modernization--Energy, is a vertically integrated automated information system consisting of base-level components and enterprise-level systems providing visibility of bulk fuel assets and fuel transactions to the Services and DLA Energy. A6.7.2.  The  EBS  is  a  web-based  Enterprise  Resource  Planning  (ERP)  solution  that  uses leading  edge  software  technology  to  provide  a  comprehensive  suite  of  business  and  supply chain management applications and services for DLA, as well as DLA Customers and Business Partners.  EBS collects, routes, and reports fuel transactions among bases, contractors, DLA Energy, DFAS and other entities.  It acts as the DLA Energy data warehouse that stores fuel transactions purchased by the DOD Fleet Card. A6.7.3.  These  systems  facilitate  standard  unit  pricing,  requirement  analysis,  and  inter-fund billing.    DOD  Fleet  Card  fuel  purchases  are  passed  to  EBS  by  the  fleet  card  contractor.  Transactions  are  rolled  up  by  DODAAC  /sub-account,  a  document  number  is  assigned  and standard price applied for inter-fund billing.  This information is passed to DFAS. A6.7.4.  What units are being charged for fuel:  When the DOD Fuel Card is used, the Standard Price per gallon is charged to the unit.  The unit is NOT charged the “pump price”.  This is because DLA Energy pays for the actual (pump) price through the Defense Working Capital Fund. A6.7.4.1.  The Office of Management and Budget sets the Standard Price not DLA Energy. A6.8.  Non-Fuel Purchase Funding and Payment Procedures.  All non-fuel purchases will be paid directly to the card vendor before or by the invoice due date (normally 30 days after invoice date).  Specific non-fuel payment procedures can be found on the VM Neighborhood. A6.8.1.  In order to assure continuity, locality specific payment procedures must be established with the servicing Accounting & Finance Budget Office when accounts are established. A6.8.2.  Account activities should provide the unit Resource Advisor an estimate of non-fuel purchases each fiscal quarter or year as needed. Note:  The AO and/or CO must take into account the lead time required by DFAS to process Miscellaneous Pay transactions when working to meet payment due dates. A6.8.3.  Accounts with delinquent non-fuel “undisputed” balances are subject to card and/or account  suspension  or  termination  w/o  prior  notification  from  the  AFCPM.    The  following actions may occur when an account has a non-fuel delinquent balance: A6.8.3.1.  90  days  delinquent  –  “Hard”  suspension  (suspension  of  non-fuel  purchasing capabilities).  Suspension will be lifted when delinquent amount is received by the fleet card vendor. AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 317 A6.8.3.2.  150 days delinquent – Account entirely suspended (effecting both fuel and non-fuel  fuel  purchasing  capabilities).    Suspension  will  be  lifted  when  delinquent  amount  is received by the fuel card contractor, however account will be changed to “fuel only” status.  Unit  desiring  to  reestablish  non-fuel  purchase  capabilities  must  submit  request memorandum  w/justification  and  concurrence  from  the  first  0-6  in  the  AO’s  chain-of-command. A6.8.3.3.  180 days delinquent – Account termination.  Units will still be responsible to pay entire balance.  Units with terminated accounts may not re-apply for a fuel card account for six months after the termination date.  Request to re-initiate an account must include justification and have concurrence from the first 0-6 in the unit’s chain of command. A6.8.4.  “Cash Back” credits are applied to account non-fuel balances by participating vendors and not the fleet card vendor.  In an effort to save administrative labor, the AFCPM reserves the right to use these credits to assist in paying small non-fuel balances of other accounts. A6.9.  Account Documentation and Continuity Requirement.  Various documentation will be maintained for account management, program management and for continuity purposes.    This information  can  be  maintain  electronically  and/or  via  hard  copy  file(s)  or  in  a  continuity book(s)/binder(s).  The information will be divided into two parts, files or sections: 1) Funding and Transactions 2) Card Administration and Management Control. A6.9.1.  Funding and Transactions.

Billing cycle (monthly) transaction documents (grouped by billing cycle). These documents include: A6.9.1.2.1.  Vendor  Invoices.  WEX produces monthly invoices for download using the WEX Online® Account Management System only if non-fuel purchases were made during the billing cycle (first calendar day to last calendar day each month) and/or there is a non-fuel purchase balance due.  The “balance due”  amount on the monthly invoice will only reflect the amount due to non-fuel purchases. A6.9.1.2.2.  Monthly Purchase Transaction Reports.  Also available on WEX Online® regardless  of  invoice  availability.      These  reports  will  be  downloaded  and  used  to reconcile/validate (against receipts)  ALL purchases. A6.9.1.2.3.

In  event  the  would-be  Buyer  is  not approved by GSA, the auction process will resume. A7.5.2.  Vehicles  with  the  following  DEMIL  codes  are  ineligible  for  AFSVSP  and  will  be disposed of via DLA-DS.  WebFLIS will be used to determine DEMIL code and IC for vehicle NSN/NIIN. A7.5.2.1.  DEMIL  code  “A”,  IC  field  “blank”  =  Not  AFSVSP  Eligible;  dispose  of  via DLA-DS. A7.5.2.2.  DEMIL codes “B”, “C”, “D” and “F” = Not AFSVSP Eligible; dispose of via DLA-DS. A7.5.3.  The following vehicles are ineligible for the AFSVSP, regardless of DEMIL codes specified in paragraph A7.5.1, and will be disposed of via DLA-DS: A7.5.3.1.  Firefighting  vehicles  (e.g.,  pumpers,  tankers,  ladders,  crash,  high  reach,  etc.) cannot be disposed of under the Exchange/Sale Authority without GSA waiver and must be disposed of via DLA-DS.  Waiver approvals are generated by the Office of Government Wide  Policy  (OGP).    441  VSCOS  will  correspond  with  OGP  providing  a  written justification for the waiver. A7.5.3.2.  R-11 aircraft refueling vehicles cannot be sold under the AFSVSP and must be disposed of via DLA-DS. A7.5.3.3.  CLAV, CHAV or military armored vehicles. A7.6.

Vehicles  that  have  major/total  loss collision damage, missing or totally inoperable major components/system (e.g., engine, drive-train, electrical or safety systems), impractical to restore (scrap), and/or considered dangerous to the public are not candidates for the AFSVSP. A7.6.4.  Vehicle  Management  activities  will  validate  vehicle’s  condition  is  the  same  as reflected on initially submitted LTI.  Vehicle Management activities will prep vehicle (remove trash, perform basic cleaning inside and out, properly dispose of license plate(s) and/or remove military  markings)  and  email  photographs  with  any  other  sales  pertinent  vehicle description/condition/ and unit POC information to 441 VSCOS. A7.6.5.  441  VSCOS  compiles  vehicle  pictures,  description  and  condition  information  for submission to GSA.  441 VSCOS will also list/establish: A7.6.5.1.  Fair market value or reserve price of the vehicle. A7.6.5.2.  Vehicle  inspection  criteria/date.    441  VSCOS  will  coordinate  date  with  VM POC. A7.6.5.3.  Advise of installation security/entry control requirements. A7.7.  Vehicle Solicitation to Other Federal or State Agencies.  IAW the FMR Exchange/Sale Authority, property (vehicles) must be solicited to other governmental agencies before they can be auctioned  to  the  general  public.    This  is  done  by  advertising  availability  on  the  GSAXcess® website  (https://gsaxcess.gov/fedswel.htm).    If  after  two  days  contact  is  not  made  with  441 VSCOS to discuss terms of a vehicle sale/transfer, or the AF and potential buyer does not agree to vehicle sale/transfer terms, then 441 VSCOS is authorized to auction vehicles to the general public. A7.7.1.  441  VSCOS  will  establish  “MySales”  account  with  GSA  in  order  to  post  vehicle information on the GSAXcess® website.  The My Sale account is not needed to post but it is needed to keep track of listed assets. A7.7.2.  441 VSCOS has decision and release authority for selling assets to other governmental agencies prior to public sales. A7.8.  Auctioning Vehicles to the General Public.  If vehicles are not sold/transferred to another government agency, 441 VSCOS will take action to initiate public auction of assets. A7.8.1.  441 VSCOS notifies GSA to move vehicle sales details to the GSA Auction® website (http://gsaauctions.gov/gsaauctions/gsaauctions/). A7.8.2.  GSA  creates  an  “Invitation  for  Bid”  (IFB)  using  vehicle  information  previously provided by 441 VSCOS and forwards to 441 VSCOS for preview. Note:  IFB is a GSA term used for the webpage attributes that displays an asset for auction. A7.8.3.  441 VSCOS reviews IFB.  Upon IFB approval, 441 VSCOS provides GSA the fair market value/reserve price that will be used. 326 AFI24-302  26  JUNE 2012 A7.8.4.  GSA  places  vehicle  on  auction  website  for  a  minimum  of  seven  days.    During  the “open” bidding period, the VM POC will answer questions from potential buyers, schedule viewing  times,  coordinate  installation  access  and  escort  personnel  to  inspect  vehicles.  However, workload and local mission priorities take precedence. A7.8.5.  GSA uses the following terms and condition when listing vehicles on GSA website. A7.9.  Post Auction Activities.  Buyer makes payment, the vehicle is removed by the buyer and action is taken to remove asset from accountability system. A7.9.1.  Upon auction closure, GSA provides 441 VSCOS the winning bidder/buyer’s contact information.  441 VSCOS forwards that information to the local VM POC. A7.9.2.  Under GSA guidelines, the buyer has 5 days to make payment to GSA.  GSA then subtracts commission for sale and forwards net proceeds to LOA provided by 441 VSCOS. A7.9.3.
