HQ AFMPC/DPMM getsSenate confirmation before appointing medical officers to EAD as lieutenant colonels. Until confirmed bythe Senate, medical officers otherwise qualified for the grade of lieutenant colonel receive the grade ofmajor.11. Determining Entry Grade Credit.11.1. Calculating Service Credit.

Add any partial credit according to these guidelines:Medical and dental officers get credit for all active commissioned time served (year-for-year).Chaplains get credit for active commissioned status not on EAD one-to-one up to 1 year.Calculate commissioned service on EAD on a year-for-year basis for officers other than chap-lains in Table 1. rules 7 through 10.

Applicants receive word that they must take a medical examination. The orders issuing activi-ties explain the entire process of what happens if they are tentatively accepted for EAD, including thatthe government will not pay for travel expenses.12.2. Applicants on active duty arrange for the examinations at their own installations. If they are noton active duty, they can take the physicals at any Air Force installation with appropriate medical facil-ities. If flying status is not involved, they can also take the physicals at a Military Entrance ProcessingStation (Recruiting Office), or at an Army or Navy medical facility.13. Recalling Retired Officers to EAD.13.1. Permanently Retired Officers. The Air Force will not recall to EAD any officer who perma-nently retired for physical disability. If the officer retires for other than a physical reason, a waivermay occasionally be given if the Air Force needs the retiree's special skills. In such cases, the AirForce limits EAD to the minimum time needed to complete the specific assignment or to train anotherofficer to do the job. If you are requesting this kind of waiver, include a full justification.13.2. Temporarily Disabled Retired Officers. Officers who were on the temporary disabilityretired list (TDRL) and are now physically able to continue military service may usually return toEAD. In such cases, recall depends on the needs of the Air Force when the officer becomes available.The Air Force usually does not recall from TDRL officers serving in a deferred promotion status.14. Limited Period Call to EAD. Tours extended past the three-year point will move the officer to theADL. EAD tours of 3 years or less will keep the officer on the Reserve Active Status List (RASL). Con-secutive LPRP tours are considered on a case-by-case basis. A request for a consecutive tour requiresreapplication and justification. Members meeting RASL eligibility who desire to stay on LPRP by volun-teering for subsequent tours, move to the ADL or can return to the ANG/AFR for a minimum of 1 yearprior to returning to an LPRP tour to remain RASL eligible.

This change clarifies FY 2000 National Defense Authorization Act regarding Reserve officer promotions serving on Active Duty and AF/DP policy on Reserve Officers serving on active duty under the Limited Period Recall Program. It stipulates that officers recalled to active duty for 3 years or less remain on the Reserve Active Status List (RASL). Officers on duty for more than 3 years meet promotions on the Active Duty List. Officers wish-ing to remain on the RASL must have a 1-year break and return to the Reserve before performing another 3-year tour. See the last attachment of the publication, IC 2002-1, for the complete IC. A bar (/) indicates revision from the previous edition. OPR: AFPC/DPPAOO (Mr. Bob Ross) Supersedes: AFI 36-2008 19 August 94 Certified by: HQ AFPC/DPP (Col Dale M. Vande Hey) 14. Limited Period Call to EAD. Tours extended past the three-year point will move the officer to the ADL. EAD tours of 3 years or less will keep the officer on the Reserve Active Status List (RASL). Con-secutive LPRP tours are considered on a case-by-case basis. A request for a consecutive tour requires reapplication and justification. Members meeting RASL eligibility who desire to stay on LPRP by volun-teering for subsequent tours, move to the ADL or can return to the ANG/AFR for a minimum of 1 year prior to returning to an LPRP tour to remain RASL eligible.
