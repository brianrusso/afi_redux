SUMMARY OF CHANGES This revision incorporates management Industrial Facilities under DoDD 4275.5 and cancels AFI 63-609,  Managing  Industrial  Facilities,  by  encompassing  applicable  information  into  Chapter 12 of this instruction.  This revision also hereby cancels AFI 63-131, Modification Management, by encompassing applicable information  into  Chapter  9 of this instruction.  This  AFI includes multiple changes resulting from the release of the DoDI 5000.02, Change 2, in Feb 2017 and is restructured  to  align  and  reduce  duplication  with  this  DoDI.    This  rewrite  also  codifies  AF Guidance Memorandums for AFI 63-101/20-101 on risk decisions and accelerating acquisition, respectively.  A chapter for Acquisition Security was created and expands on program protection planning  and  cybersecurity.    The  implementation  of  information  technology  (IT)  chapter  was restructured  to  show  compliance  with  Chief  Information  Officer  (CIO)  authorities.    The  AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 3 applicability  of  the  AFI  was  also  clarified  to  show  required  dependent  activities.    Document coordination  was  changed  to  put  more  responsibility  with  the  approval  authority  to  coordinate outside  the  Program  Executive  Officer  (PEO)  structure.    Finally,  it  includes  administrative changes to correct format, organizational changes, and typographical errors.  Chapter 1— INTEGRATED LIFE CYCLE MANAGEMENT  1.1.

Purpose  of  AFI  63-101/20-101,  Integrated  Life  Cycle  Management  (ILCM).  This instruction  contains  the  directive  overarching  processes  and  procedures  required  to  deliver  and sustain  warfighting  capabilities.    Used  in  partnership  with  the  non-directive  best  practices  and procedures  in  Air  Force  Pamphlet  (AFPAM)  63-128,  Integrated  Life  Cycle  Management,  AF personnel  can  efficiently  implement  the  concepts  of  ILCM.    ILCM  governs  all  aspects  of infrastructure,  resource  management,  and  business  systems  necessary  for  the  successful acquisition  of  systems,  subsystems,  end  items,  and  services  to  satisfy  validated  warfighter requirements.    Use  this  instruction  in  conjunction  with  AFI  10-601,  Operational  Capability Requirements  Development,  AFI  99-103,  Capabilities-Based  Test  and  Evaluation,  AFI  63-138, Acquisition of Services, and applicable 17-series documents to provide an integrated framework for the implementation of ILCM. 1.2.  Applicability.  This instruction applies to the management of all acquisition programs (e.g., weapons  systems,  national  security  systems  [NSS],  and  defense  business  systems  [DBS])  as denoted on the Acquisition Master List (AML), all investment-funded activities (product groups, systems, activities, services, and projects) in any phase of the lifecycle, and Legacy programs in the O&S Phase not previously on the AML.  Depending upon the type of investment activity and the  maturity  of  the  program,  different  sections  of  the  document  apply.    Activities  and applicability of the document are listed below: 1.2.1.  Acquisition  Category  (ACAT)  Programs  (or  AML  Programs).    ACAT  programs  are defined and managed per DoDD 5000.01 and DoDI 5000.02.  ACAT programs are required to  follow  the  guidance  in  this  AFI  and  are  documented  on  the  AML.    AF  acquisition programs  begin  by  utilizing  investment  funding  (i.e.,  Research,  Development,  Test  and Evaluation (RDT&E) and/or procurement) to satisfy a validated need.  Programs retain their ACAT designation through sustainment, until disposed of or terminated, and are categorized on the open/closed AML and the active/inactive Investment Master List (IML), depending on phase  and  funding  type;  see  Chapter  11  for  more  information.    ACAT  III  has  no  funding floor and encompasses all programs not included within ACAT I, IA, and II. 1.2.1.1.  ACAT  and  Legacy  programs  in  the  Operations  and  Support  (O&S)  Phase.  Sustainment  (or  O&S  phase)  requirements,  identified  in  DoDI  5000.02  and  this publication, apply to programs or systems utilizing Operations and Maintenance (O&M) funding.    Systems  in  the  O&S  phase  are  not  required  to  retroactively  meet  information requirements  identified  in  previous  phases  of  the  acquisition  lifecycle.    These  systems should  continue  to  meet  the  requirements  needed  for  continued  operation  of  the  system including the following: 1.2.1.1.1.  Modifications.    Modifications  to  systems  are  specified  in  Chapter  9.  Permanent  modifications  to  an  operational  capability  may  result  in  a  new  ACAT program, and the requirements of DoDI 5000.02 and this AFI apply. 1.2.1.1.2.  Maintenance Activities.  Maintenance activities for existing programs, that are  not  considered  a  permanent  ACAT  modification  and  do  not  utilize  investment funding  are  not  required  to  be  managed  as  a  new  ACAT  program.    These  activities  10 AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 should manage the activity IAW program processes.  This instruction does not apply to the following modification activities: 1.2.1.1.2.1.  Replacement  Interchangeable  Items  which  do  not  involve  the alteration  of  an  existing  asset.  MIL-HDBK-61A,  Configuration  Management Guidance,  an  interchangeable  product  possesses  such  functional  and  physical attributes  as  to  be  equivalent  in  performance  to  another  product  of  similar  or identical  purposes;  and  is  capable  of  being  exchanged  with  the  other  product without alteration of the products themselves or of adjoining products. to  retain/restore 1.2.1.1.2.2.  O&M  funded  actions  that  keep  a  previously  established  level  of performance  through  routine,  recurring  work  correction  of  product  quality deficiencies  or the  functional  baseline  or  performance specification  and  do  not  extend  service  life  of  the  equipment  or  alter  Form,  Fit, Function, or Interface.  Maintenance actions such as the materiel repair, overhaul, or  rebuilding  of  parts,  assemblies,  or  subassemblies,  and  the  testing  and reclamation  of  equipment  to  correct  a  deficient  condition  in  the  originally designed  functionality.  This  includes  depot-level  maintenance  as  defined  in  10 U.S.C. §2460. 1.2.1.1.2.3.  Maintenance  or  tech  refresh  of  commercially  available  office information systems and associated software. 1.2.1.1.2.4.  Individual  engineering  changes  completed  as  part  of  an  existing ACAT  program  involving  developmental  items  or  production  articles  that  have not been formally accepted by the government via a Department of Defense (DD) Form 250, Materiel Inspection and Receiving Report. 1.2.1.1.2.5.  Assets that are no longer part of an active inventory, such as aircraft in long-term storage that are not part of a reutilization effort. 1.2.1.1.2.6.  Modifications  of telecommunications equipment, or property. facilities  or  other  base-level infrastructure, 1.2.1.1.3.  Other  Activities.   Sustainment  (O&S  phase)  activities  that  utilize investment funding should report the funding IAW the reporting requirements of this AFI (Chapter 11) and be categorized as either an AML or AML-Exempt program. 1.2.2.  Investment  Activities  (AML-Exempt).    AML-Exempt  investment  activities  are  not considered ACAT programs and are not required to follow DoDI 5000.02 guidance related to the  management  of  acquisition  programs.    All  investment  activities  are  required  to  report investment  funding  and  be  categorized  as  AML-Exempt  per  Chapter  11.    All  investment activities  are  required  to  comply  with  Federal  Acquisition  Regulation  (FAR)  and  financial management  requirements  as  defined.    Additional  AML-Exempt  investment  activities include: 1.2.2.1.  Civilian  Pay  (Investment-Funded),  Commodity  Procurements,  Developmental Infrastructure  Sustainment,  Development  of  Enterprise  Architectures/Certifications,  and Replenishment Spares Procurements.  These activities follow other applicable guidance, such as AFI 99-103 and AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program.  AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 11 1.2.2.2.  Services.  The  management  procedures  of  this  AFI  do  not  apply  to  Services activities  managed  IAW  DoDI  5000.74,  Defense  Acquisition  of  Services,  and  AFI  63-138. 1.2.2.3.  Studies. Studies are required to follow the reporting requirements of this AFI, in Chapter 11, as well as AFI 90-1603, Air Force Studies Management and Registration. 1.2.2.4.  Technology  Projects.  The  management  procedures  of  this  AFI  do  not  apply  to science and technology (S&T) programs, demonstrations, experiments, or projects, which are managed IAW AFI 61-101, Management of Science and Technology. 1.2.3.  Special Access Program (SAP).  IAW AFI 16-701, Management, Administration and Oversight  of  Special  Access  Programs  (SAP),  SAPs  follow  separate  life  cycle  management guidance.  The  Assistant  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  for  Acquisition,  Directorate  of  Special Programs  (SAF/AQL),  in  coordination  with  the  Director,  Security,  Special  Programs Oversight and Information Protection (SAF/AAZ), is responsible for these activities. 1.2.4.  Security  Cooperation  and  Foreign  Military  Sales  (FMS).    Security  Cooperation  and FMS  programs  support  US  foreign  policy  and  national  security  objectives  by  enabling  the United  States  (US)  to  build,  sustain,  expand,  and  guide  international  partnerships  that  are critical enablers for its national security objectives. 1.2.4.1.  Security  Cooperation  FMS  acquisition  programs  are  executed  IAW  the  Arms Export  Control  Act  and  Defense  Security  Cooperation  Agency  (DSCA)  5105.38-M, Security  Assistance  Management  Manual  (SAMM),  DoD  Financial  Management Regulation  7000.14-R,  Department  of  Defense  Financial  Management  Regulation (FMR), and AFMAN 16-101, International Affairs and Security Assistance Management. 1.2.4.2.  FMS  programs  are  implemented  based  on  the  direction  in  the  DoD  5000 acquisition series,  DoD  5200 series, 99-series test  AFIs, 63-series acquisition AFIs, 14-series  AFIs,  and  16-series  operations  support  AFIs  to  afford  the  foreign  purchaser  the same benefits and protections that apply to DoD procurement.  The applicability to each FMS  case  of  tailored  requirements,  or  application  of  unique  requirements,  from  these policies is limited to what is contained in the government-to-government agreement. 1.2.4.3.  The responsibility for FMS programs is limited to elements/tasks contained in a government-to-government  agreement.    This  agreement  is  implemented  for  execution through  the  appropriate  accountability  reporting  chain  of  the  assigned  DoD  component authority. 1.2.4.3.1.  The  government-to-government  agreement  established  by  a  bilaterally signed Letter of Offer and Acceptance should specify any tailored implementation of acquisition direction for the FMS program. 1.2.4.3.2.  Collaboration  with  the  user  should  occur  as  early  as  possible  in  the program’s life cycle on the feasibility of exportable and interoperable configurations and open system architectures in the system design based on an analysis of the current and  future  international  market.    This  can  enable  more  timely  and  efficient  future FMS cases; however, changes that add requirements or costs must be approved by the user.  12 AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 1.2.5.  Defense  Business  Systems  (DBS).    DBS  follow  DoDI  5000.75,  Business  Systems Requirements  and  Acquisition,  and  AFMAN  63-144,  Defense  Business  System  Life  Cycle Management,  for the acquisition of the system.   DBS programs  develop  requirements  IAW AFMAN 33-402, Service Development and Delivery Process.  DBS programs are subject to IML  categorization  and  acquisition  reporting  detailed  in  Chapter  11  of  this  AFI.    The functional  sponsor uses the PEO Portfolio Assignment Process  for assignment of a  DBS to the appropriate PEO. 1.3.  Integrated  Life  Cycle  Framework.  Figure  1.1  details  the  multi-functional  collaborative effort  among  the  requirements,  acquisition  and  sustainment,  test,  information  operations,  and intelligence  communities  (IC)  necessary  for  system  life  cycle  management  required  for acquisition of a system.  This graphic is only one representation of the multiple tailorable models that should be utilized from DoDI 5000.02.  Details on key acquisition and sustainment activities outlined  in  the  framework  can  be  found  in  the  body  of  this  document,  other  supporting documentation,  or  by  using  the  AF  Acquisition  Process  Model  (APM)  tool.    For  more information regarding requirements and test and evaluation, reference AFI 10-601 and AFI 99-103.  For more information regarding IT management and compliance, refer to the applicable 17-series documents describing IT acquisition and CIO compliance requirements. Figure 1.1.  ILCM Framework.     AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 13 1.4.  Compliance, Tiering, Waivers, and Tailoring. 1.4.1.  Compliance.  Compliance "shall" and "will" statements have been reduced throughout this AFI.  Consistent with AFI 33-360, “the absence of 'punitive' language in a paragraph of a publication  does  not  mean  compliance  is  optional,  or  that  a  military  member  or  civilian employee cannot be disciplined for violating non-punitive requirements in a publication. All AF  personnel  must  comply  with  both  punitive  and  non-punitive  mandatory  guidance  in publications."  The AF is reducing compliance statements, or tiering them for Wing-level and below waiver authority, for all publications in order to reduce unnecessary resource tasking, funding, and/or duplicative or unnecessary inspection requirements. 1.4.2.  Tiering.    IAW  the  ILCM  chain  of  authority  specified  in  this  AFI,  mandates  to  the acquisition  execution  chain  are  not  considered  Wing-level  mandates  and  therefore  tiering, IAW  AFI  33-360,  does  not  apply.    When  tiering  does  apply  for  a  wing/unit-level requirement(s),  waiver  authority  is  identified  with  a  Tier  (“Tier-0,  Tier-1,  Tier-2,  Tier-3”) number  following  the  compliance  statement.    See  AFI  33-360  for  a  description  of  the authorities associated with the tier numbers.  Tiering numbers are spelled out to differentiate with Temporary Modification designations in Chapter 9. 1.4.3.  Waivers.    A  waiver  is  a  statement  to  relinquish,  or  provide  exceptions  to,  a  specific statutory  or  regulatory  requirement.    Waivers  from  compliance  must  be  based  on  a programmatic course of action approved by the SAE or MDA through the program’s ILCM chain of authority and documented in the appropriate program documentation. 1.4.3.1.  Waiver  authority  belongs  to  the  publication  approval  authority  and  waivers  are processed IAW AFI 33-360; for this AFI, this authority is Assistant Secretary of the Air Force  (Acquisition,  Technology,  and  Logistics)  (SAF/AQ)  with  signature  authority  for waivers delegated to SAF/AQX. 1.4.3.2.  Where  there  is  a  clear  conflict  between  approved  courses  of  action  and  where DoD policy/guidance does not allow for tailoring of process, regardless of ACAT level, SAF/AQ shall request waivers from the appropriate DoD office.  If a waiver is required, the  waiver  request  should  be  submitted  to  the  publication  Office  of  Primary Responsibility  (OPR)  for  appropriate  staffing  and  approval  among  Headquarters  Air Force (HAF) functional authorities. 1.4.3.3.  Where  the  course  of  action,  as  approved  and  documented  through  the  ILCM chain  of  authority,  conflicts  with  an  Air  Force  Policy  Directive  (AFPD),  the  Program Manager  (PM)  shall  submit  a  request  for  a  waiver  to  the  certifying  authority  for  the publication,  who,  in  turn,  obtains  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  (SECAF)  approval  for  the waiver, if warranted. 1.4.3.4.  Where  the  course  of  action,  as  approved  and  documented  through  the  ILCM chain of authority, conflicts with AF Departmental directive issuances other than AFPDs, the  PM  shall  submit  a  notification  via  memorandum  to  the  publication  OPR  for  action.  The  OPR  takes  appropriate  action  to  either  provide  direction  to  comply  with  policy, obtain  a  waiver  to  requirements,  or  to  initiate  changes  to  publications  to  resolve  the conflict IAW AFI 33-360.  Resolution of conflicts between AF issuances is resolved by the appropriate HAF functional.  14 AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 1.4.3.5.  Waivers  for  SAPs  are  submitted  through  the  relevant  Major  Commands (MAJCOM)  SAP  Management  Office  for  submission  to  the  appropriate  HAF/SAF organizations for adjudication. 1.4.4.  Tailoring.  Tailoring recognizes that acquisition programs are not all the same.  Policy permits  customized  reviews,  processes,  and  decision  support  information  to  accommodate the unique characteristics of a program while still meeting the statutory and regulatory needs for  decision  making  and  oversight.    Tailoring  for  programs  is  requested  by  the  PM  and approved by the MDA.  Tailoring ensures a program is able to balance risks in providing the needed capability to the warfighter in the shortest practical time while ensuring affordability and supportability.  This is done by using sufficient, relevant, and timely information about uncertainty to proactively make better decisions.  Reference DoDI 5000.02 and AFPAM 63-128 for more information on tailoring. 1.4.4.1.  Tailoring  is  documented,  including  the  supporting  rationale  and  citation  to  the applicable  statute  or  regulation.  The  PM  shall  identify  the  tailoring  strategy  in  the Acquisition Strategy (AS) and/or Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM). The MDA approves the tailoring strategy as part of the documentation approval. 1.4.4.2.  Tailoring may be limited by statute or other guidance and should not result in a requirement being waived. 1.4.5.  If  the  PM  indicates  an  activity,  not  specified  by  statute  or  regulation,  does  not  add value to their program, the PM can require the proponent to justify the activity and identify the  resources  (e.g.,  materiel,  personnel,  skills,  training,  and  funding)  for  execution.  The proponent  may  appeal  a  PM  determination  through  the  ILCM  chain  of  authority  up  to  the MDA; however, the burden of proof lies with the proponent. 1.5.  Integrated  Life  Cycle  Management  (ILCM)  Chain  of  Authority.  All  AF  programs require a clear and unambiguous ILCM chain of authority.  The management structure should be streamlined  and  characterized  by  short,  clearly  defined  lines  of  responsibility,  authority,  and accountability.  AF life cycle management responsibility for all ACAT programs flows from the SAE to  the PEO to  the  accountable PM.   IAW  DoDD 5000.01, DoDI 5000.02, and AFPD 63-1/20-1, in no case may there be more than two levels of review between the PM and the MDA.  Organizational leaders that are between or support the accountable PM, PEO and/or MDA need to  stay  informed,  but  shall  not  hinder  direct  and  open  access  from  the  PM  to  the  MDA.    Only those  in  the  ILCM  chain  of  authority  exercise  decision-making  authority  on  programmatic matters. 1.5.1.  The PM documents the ILCM chain of authority (also known as the programmatic or acquisition execution chain) in the AS.  Ensure all programs establish clear lines of program execution authority with documentation based on the guidance below. 1.5.1.1.  Milestone Decision Authority (MDA).  The MDA as defined in DoDD 5000.01 is the designated individual with overall responsibility for a program.  The MDA has the authority  to  approve  entry  of  a  program  into  the  next  phase  of  the  life  cycle  process, certify  milestone  (MS)  criteria,  and  is  accountable  for  cost,  schedule,  and  performance reporting to higher authority, including Congressional reporting.  The decision authority of the MDA and delegation is defined in Table 1.1.  For acquisition of services, decision authority delegations are in AFI 63-138.  AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 15 1.5.1.1.1.  Defense Acquisition Executive (DAE).  The DAE acts as the  MDA  IAW the guidelines specified in DoDI 5000.02 for ACAT IDs and IAM programs. 1.5.1.1.2.  Service Acquisition Executive (SAE).  The SAE has overall authority and responsibility for the management of AF acquisition programs.  MDA responsibilities are performed by the following: 1.5.1.1.2.1.  MDA responsibilities for ACAT IC, ACAT IAC, ACAT II, or special interest programs are conducted by the SAE.  MDA responsibilities for ACAT II programs may be delegated to a PEO. 1.5.1.1.2.2.  MDA  authorities  for  ACAT  III  programs  are  delegated  to  a  PEO.  PEOs  may  delegate  ACAT  III  MDA  authorities  to  any  appropriately  qualified individual.  Unless waived or specifically directed by the SAE, delegated MDAs comply with the PEO position requirements (reference DoDI 5000.66, Operation of  Defense  AT&L  Workforce  Education,  Training,  and  Career  Development Program and AFI 36-1301, Management of Acquisition Key Leadership Positions [KLP]).    PEOs  shall  notify  the  SAE,  the  AF  Director,  Acquisition  Career Management Implementing  Command Commander of all such  delegations.  The SAE has the  authority  to  rescind such delegations.    Note:  When  the  MDA  is  delegated,  SAF/AQH  will  schedule  the member  for  any  required  training;  if  unable  to  accomplish  training  requirements within the six month grace period, a waiver will be coordinated through the SAE.   MDA  delegation  does  not  confer  PEO  authorities.    MDA  authority  cannot  be delegated  to  the  PM  or  Deputy  PM  of  the  same  program(s)  they  are  being designated MDA.  No further delegation is allowed. (SAF/AQH),  and (DACM) the Table 1.1.  Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) Delegation.

The PEO is responsible for the management of assigned portfolio and ensures collaboration across the ILCM framework.  The PEO is responsible  for,  and  has  authority  to  accomplish  assigned  portfolio/program  objectives for development, production, sustainment, and disposal to meet warfighters’ operational needs.  The PEO may identify a director of engineering to be accountable to the PEO for oversight of the portfolio’s engineering functional support. 1.5.1.2.1.  The PEO provides dedicated executive program management of delegated programs. 1.5.1.2.2.  All  personnel  assigned  as  a  PEO  shall  meet  the  Key  Leadership  Position (KLP)  qualifications  and  tenure  requirements  identified  in  this  instruction  and  AFI 36-1301, Management of Acquisition Key Leadership Positions. 1.5.1.3.  Program  Manager  (PM).    The  PM,  as  defined  in  DoDD  5000.01,  is  the designated  individual  with  the  responsibility  for  and  authority  to  accomplish  program objectives  for  development,  production,  and  sustainment  to  meet  the  user’s  operational needs. 1.5.1.3.1.  All  programs  on the AML, to  include ACAT programs,  weapons systems identified  by  AFPD  10-9,  automated  information  systems,  and  defense  business systems,  shall  be  assigned  only  one  PM.    The  PM  should  be  clearly  identified  and documented. 1.5.1.3.2.  The  PM  is  accountable  for  credible  cost,  schedule,  and  performance reporting  and  analysis  to  the  MDA.    The  PM  has  responsibility  and  authority  to accomplish objectives for the total life cycle of the program. 1.5.1.4.  Program  Support.    The  PM  leads  the  program  organization  in  executing  the mission.    Functional  representatives  within  the  program,  irrespective  of  location  or whether  supporting  the  program  on  a  full-time  or  part-time  basis,  shall  take  program direction from the PM for program-related activities.  The PM identifies and defines the roles and responsibilities of the following principal  support functions that are critical  to the  successful  execution  of  the  PM's  responsibilities  to  meet  the  warfighter's  capability needs:  the  Chief  Engineer  (CE),  the  Product  Support  Manager  (PSM),  and  the  Chief Developmental  Tester  (CDT)/Test  Manager  (TM).    Role  and  responsibility  descriptions include  specific  delegations  and  limitations  of  delegations,  establish  clear  lines  of accountability,  and identify  requirements  for  cross-functional  management  and coordination.  The PM keeps these descriptions current throughout the system life cycle.  Other functional positions may be included at the PM’s discretion. 1.5.1.4.1.  Chief Engineer (CE).  The CE is assigned as soon as possible following the assignment of the PM.  Note: The AF term “Chief Engineer” is synonymous with the DoDI 5000.02 term “Lead Systems Engineer.” 1.5.1.4.2.  Product Support Manager (PSM).  The PEO shall ensure a PSM is assigned to  all ACAT  I,  ACAT  II programs,  and Weapon  Systems  identified by AFPD 10-9.  For ACAT I and II programs in the O&S phase and all ACAT III programs, the PM and  PSM  may  be  dual-hatted  if  approved  by  the  Implementing  Command  and  the PEO.  For Joint Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAPs) where the PSM is not an  AF  position,  an  AF  Service  PSM  position  is  established  to  support  the  MDAP  AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 17 PSM.    The  Service  PSM  reports  directly  to  the  AF  organization  assigned responsibility  for  supporting  the  Joint  Program  Office.    The  PSM  is  assigned simultaneously with the PM. 1.5.1.4.3.  Chief  Developmental  Tester  (CDT)/Test  Manager  (TM).    All  MDAP  and Major  Automated  Information  System  (MAIS)  programs  require  a  CDT  which  is designated as a Key Leadership Position (KLP) IAW USD (AT&L) policy.  All other ACAT programs will identify a TM.  While the TM does not need to meet the more stringent  workforce  qualifications  of  the  CDT,  they  must  be  able  to  perform  the CDT/TM responsibilities as detailed in AFI 99-103. 1.5.1.4.4.  Other  Program  Support.    Other  program  support  consists  of  resources performing program execution activities in support of a PM.  This includes, but is not limited  to,  financial  management,  cost  analysis,  contracting,  legal,  intelligence, program  integration,  cybersecurity,  Environment,  Safety,  and  Occupational  Health (ESOH),  small  business  (SB),  program  protection  or  security,  and  meteorological analysis. 1.5.2.  Staff  Organizations.  Staffs  at  all  levels  advise  ILCM  leadership/management  and assist  them  with  their  responsibilities.  Councils,  committees,  advisory  groups,  panels,  and staffs provide advice  and recommendations to  the PM, PEO, MDA, SAE and/or  DAE  who are  accountable  for  the  overall  program  results.    The  PM  is  responsible  for  and  has  the authority  to  execute  a  program.  Staff  organizations  support  the  PM  by  providing  trained personnel  and  advice  to  the  PM  to  maximize  the  PM’s  opportunity  to  successfully  execute the  program.    Staff  organizations  provide  objective  inputs,  such  as  legal  or  engineering inputs,  to  the  program  decision  process.    Staff  organizations  cannot  exercise  or  imply decision-making authority on programmatic matters unless explicitly delegated by the ILCM chain of authority (e.g., industrial facilities in Chapter 12). 1.6.  PEO Portfolio Assignment or Transfer. 1.6.1.  PEO  Portfolio  Assignment.  During the requirements sponsor shall inform SAF/AQ of the potential program.  Information provided shall  contain  proposed  program  description,  estimated  dollar  value,  funding  status,  and anticipated ACAT.  With input from the Implementing Command, SAF/AQ shall assign the effort to a PEO and include confirmation of proposed ACAT level and the MDA. the  requirements  validation  process, 1.6.1.1.  PEO assignment should be initiated for all programs projected to be on the AML prior to conducting an acquisition life cycle decision.  Acquisition life cycle decisions can be made once the candidate PEO has received the initial identification memo.  If the PEO decides  to  proceed,  there  is  no  need  to  wait  until  the  official  final  memo  is  received.  Exceptions:  PEO assignment is not required for modifications to current programs which are  already  assigned  to  a  PEO.    Urgent  Capability  Acquisition  programs  may  have  the acquisition authority designated outside the PEO assignment process. 1.6.1.2.  For  legacy  systems  or  systems  transitioning  from  another  agency,  the  sponsor shall  provide  the  program  description,  estimated  dollar  value,  and  funding  status  to SAF/AQ  for  assessment.    Upon  acceptance  and  with  input  from  the  Implementing Command, SAF/AQ shall assign the effort to a PEO and determine the MDA.  18 AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 1.6.1.3.  For  technology  demonstration  projects  that  may  transition  into  acquisition programs  or  deployed  capability,  the  Sponsor  may  request  SAF/AQ  temporary assignment  of  a  PEO  to  support  technology  demonstration  transition  planning.  Temporary  PEO  assignments  shall  be  revalidated  on  an  annual  basis  and  may  be transitioned  to  a  permanent  assignment  based  on  confirmation  of  a  validated requirements document in coordination with the Implementing Command. 1.6.1.4.  Send  PEO  Portfolio  Assignment  requests  to  SAF/AQXE  (usaf.pentagon.saf-aq.mbx.saf-aqxe-workflow@mail.mil). 1.6.2.  PEO  Portfolio  Transfer.

The MDA completes the determination using a memorandum for record that addresses the requirements in 10 U.S.C. §2366a(b). 3.2.2.  MS  B  Certification.    The  MDA  (without  the  authority  to  delegate)  for  an  MDAP, along  with  the  SECAF  and  CSAF,  or  their  designee(s),  shall  assess  the  program’s concurrence with cost, schedule, technical feasibility, and performance trade-offs made, and sign a certification memorandum prior to MS B approval.  In the certification memorandum, the  MDA  must  ensure  the  determination  requirements  in  10  U.S.C.  §2366b(a)  have  been addressed.    If  the  program  is  initiated  later  than  MS  B,  the  MDA  prepares  a  similar certification memorandum and submits it to the Congressional defense committees with the first Selected Acquisition Report (SAR) submitted after completion of the certification. 3.3.  Air Force Review Boards (AFRB) and Acquisition Strategy Panels (ASP).  AFRBs and ASPs are integral to a deliberative process that supports AF leadership in making informed MS decisions and in performing their acquisition execution responsibilities. 3.3.1.  AF Review Boards (AFRB).  26 AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 3.3.1.1.  AFRBs  are  forums  chaired  by  the  SAE,  or  as  delegated,  for  conducting  major decision reviews (in- or out-of-cycle). 3.3.1.2.  For ACAT ID and ACAT IAMs, AFRBs are used to develop the AF corporate consensus prior to an Office of the Secretary Defense (OSD) Defense Acquisition Board (DAB)  (pre-DAB  within  AF)  or  Information  Technology  Acquisition  Board  (ITAB).  The AFRB should be conducted prior to OSD Integrating Integrated Product Team.  The SAE,  or  as  delegated,  determines  if  an  ACAT  ID  or  ACAT  IAM  program  requires  an AFRB. 3.3.1.3.  The  AFRB  process  is  mandatory  for  all  ACAT  IC,  ACAT  IAC,  non-delegated ACAT II programs, and special interest programs.  The PEO may recommend what type of  AFRB  is  necessary:  full,  mini  (tailored  attendance),  or  paper.    AFRB  templates  and more  information  can  be  found  at  the  AF  Portal  at  the  “SAF/AQXE  -  Execution/ Oversight” page in the Secretariat/AFRB section. 3.3.1.4.  PEOs execute a tailored review process on major decisions for delegated ACAT II and ACAT III programs. 3.3.2.  Acquisition Strategy Panel (ASP). 3.3.2.1.  The  ASP  supports  the  MDA.    ASPs  are  forums  that  evaluate  proposed acquisition  strategies  to  ensure  all  alternatives  have  been  considered  and  that  the  best recommendation  is  provided  to  the  program’s  MDA  for  approval.    Unless  delegated  in writing, the MDA is the ASP Chair (for ACAT I programs the SAE is the Chair), and is the sole authority to approve members of the panel. 3.3.2.2.  The PM shall ensure an ASP is held for all ACAT programs that are presenting a new strategy or a significant revision to an approved strategy. 3.3.2.3.  Information  concerning  ASPs,  such  as  the  current  draft  template  for  briefings, can  be  found  at  the  AF  Portal  at  the  “SAF/AQXE  -  Execution/  Oversight”  page  in  the Secretariat/ASP  section.    Additionally,  similar  information  pertaining  to  non-SAE chaired ASPs can be found by contacting the Field ACEs. 3.4.  Configuration  Steering  Board  (CSB).  The  CSB  reviews  all  requirements  changes  and any  significant  technical configuration  changes that may result in  cost  and schedule impacts  to the  program.    Changes  are  only  approved  after  funds  are  identified  and  schedule  impacts mitigated.  The CSB also provides the PM the opportunity to propose changes, with supporting rationale addressing operational implications which may be necessary to achieve affordability or that will result in a more cost effective product.  For more information reference Section 814 of Pub. L. 110-417 and DoDI 5000.02. 3.4.1.  At  a  minimum,  CSBs  are  conducted  annually  for  all  ACAT  I  and  IA  programs  in development starting at MS A. 3.4.1.1.  Annual CSB reviews may be conducted together with the annual PEO Portfolio Reviews and Program Management Reviews. 3.4.1.2.  An  event  based,  out-of-cycle  CSB  is  conducted  when  a  proposed  change  to program  requirements  would  result  in  significant  technical  configuration  changes  that potentially  result  in  cost  (estimated  greater  than  $100  million)  and  schedule  impacts  AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 27 (estimated delay of over six months) to the program or to address a Critical Intelligence Parameter (CIP) breach. 3.4.1.3.  Mandatory participants for the ACAT I and IA CSB include:  SAF/AQ (Chair), OSD  AT&L  (Rep),  CSAF  Rep  (A4L),  Lead  Command  Requirements  (e.g., ACC/A5/8/9),  AF/A5R,  Joint  Staff,  SAF/FMB,  SAF/AQ  Mil  Deputy,  and  the  PEO  for the program. 3.4.1.4.

Ensuring  a  process  is  in  place  to  review  all  requirements  changes  and  any significant  technical  configuration  changes  that  have  the  potential  to  result  in  cost  and schedule  impacts  to  the  program.    This  process  will  include  appropriate  stakeholders from the Lead Command, HAF, and the ILCM chain of authority. 3.4.2.2.  Considering  a  program  change  or  termination  recommendation  if  a  CIP  breach makes  the  program  ineffective  for  its  intended  operational  environment  or  by  not approving changes unless funds are identified and schedule impacts mitigated. 3.4.2.3.  Providing the PM the opportunity to propose changes, with supporting rationale addressing  operational  implications  which  may  be  necessary  to  achieve  affordability  or that will result in a more cost effective product. (S&T).  Science  and 3.5.  Science  &  Technology technological  advancements  and breakthroughs  play  a  crucial  role  in  providing  warfighters  with  superior  operational  systems. Examples  of  programs  and  processes  to  demonstrate,  mature,  and  transition  technologies include: technology demonstrations, experiments, operational exercises, war games, M&S, DoD and  AF  research  efforts  within  the  DoD  laboratories,  and  commercial  sources.    For  additional information on S&T activities refer to AFI 61-101. 3.5.1.  PEOs provide to the AF Technology Executive Officer (TEO) with identified portfolio needs and associated or recommended technology solutions addressing those needs. 3.5.2.  PEOs  can  use  Capability  Collaboration  Teams  (CCT),  established  by  Core  Function Leads  (CFL)  and  comprised  of  Subject  Matter  Experts  (SME)  from  MAJCOMs/CFLs, Centers and PEOs, and the TEO to work collaboratively to fully understand MAJCOM/CFL-documented  capability  needs  that  may  require  a  materiel  solution  and  determine  if  S&T  is required for any associated technology needs. 3.5.3.  PMs  and  CEs  participate  in  CCTs  and  DP  efforts  to  identify  potential  materiel solutions  derived  from  MAJCOM-documented  capability  needs  and  associated  technology  28 AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 enablers  for  those  solutions  to  formulate  and  recommend  technology  development  and maturation activities that address those needs. 3.5.4.  During  transition  from  an  S&T  effort  to  an  acquisition  program,  the  PM  should coordinate  with  the  S&T  project  lead  to  capture  information  developed  during  the  S&T effort.    Evaluation  results  may  lead  to  developing  an  operational  capability  requirements document technologies  for  new  programs  or modifications to existing programs.  S&T efforts transitioning to an acquisition program and entering  the  defense  acquisition  system  should  be  sufficiently  mature  enough  to  meet  the phase-specific requirements. transition  mature  and  affordable to 3.5.5.  PMs and CEs consider the use of Small Business Innovation Research/Small Business Technology  Transfer  (SBIR/STTR)  when  practicable.    See  AFI  61-102,  Small  Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Programs, for more information. 3.6.  Development  Planning  (DP).  The  DP  process  supports  SECAF  and  CSAF  strategic decisions  that  guide  the  Air  Force  toward  mission  success  with  available  funds  and  acceptable risk.  DP encompasses the engineering analysis, supportability and technical planning activities that provide the foundation for informed investment decisions on the fundamental path a materiel development  follows  to  meet  operational  needs  effectively  and  affordably  and  facilitates integrated capability development.  Early planning, analysis, and systems  engineering activities provide  linkages  among  operational  needs,  system  performance  requirements,  human  systems integration,  technology  needs  and  opportunities,  and  potential  life  cycle  costs.    It  establishes  a technical foundation for materiel development and should provide the analytic basis for life cycle cost  and  capability  trades  to  inform  requirements  development  and  oversight  activities supporting  acquisition  MSs,  decision  points,  and  phases.    Conducting  DP  should  result  in requirements  that  are  informed  fiscally  and  technologically  through  market  research;  concepts that  are  mature,  testable,  and  fiscally/technically  feasible;  and  areas  for  S&T  investment  are identified to reduce technology risks. 3.7.  Materiel Development Decision (MDD).  All potential programs proceed through a MDD review when entering the acquisition life cycle framework.  The MDD review is the formal entry into  the  acquisition  process.    Conduct  ACAT  I,  IA  and  II  MDD  reviews  using  the  appropriate DAB, ITAB, or AFRB process; use PEO-tailored AFRB processes for ACAT III programs.  The MDD review ensures that a complete analysis/assessment of alternatives and their non-materiel implications  is  being  or  has  been  conducted.    An  MDA  decision  to  begin  Materiel  Solution Analysis  DOES  NOT  mean  that  a  new  acquisition  program  has  been  initiated.    For  additional information, see DoDI 5000.02. 3.7.1.  The MDA chairs and approves all MDD decisions. 3.7.2.  At a minimum, conducting a MDD is dependent upon a Joint Requirements Oversight Council  (JROC),  Air  Force  requirements  process  approved  requirements  document,  or  an approved AF Form 1067, Modification Proposal, for modifications. 3.7.3.  The  Director  of  Cost  Assessment  and  Program  Evaluation  (DCAPE),  AF/A5R,  or Lead Command presents the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) Study Guidance and AoA Study Plan  or  alternative  analysis/supporting  analysis  guidance  for  MDA  approval.    The  AoA  AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 29 should  be  based  on  market  research  giving  consideration  to  maximum  practicable  SB utilization. 3.7.4.  Document  the  decisions  of  the  MDD  in  an  ADM  (e.g.,  phase  of  entry  with  phase-specific  exit  criteria  for  next  program  MS,  AoA  Study  Guidance  and  AoA  Study  Plan approval,  AF  organization,  termination  or  temporary  suspension  of  the  effort).    Provide ADM  and  AoA  Study  Guidance  and  AoA  Study  Plan  or  alternative  analysis/supporting analysis guidance to lead DoD Component/appropriate Capability Director. 3.8.  Coordination  of  Requirements  Document  Used  in  Conjunction  with  Request  for Proposals  (RFP).  All  acquisition  programs  will  coordinate  the  requirements  document  used with an RFP with the requiring Lead Command prior to the release of the final RFP.  For ACAT III programs only, the PEO and Lead Command Commander can waive this requirement.  The level  of  coordination  is  based  on  the  program’s  ACAT  as  follows:  Note:  Lead  Command Commander  may  delegate  Lead  Command  coordination  no  lower  than  one  level  below designated level: 3.8.1.  ACAT I, IA – PEO to Commander, Lead Command 3.8.2.  ACAT II – PEO to Vice Commander, Lead Command 3.8.3.  ACAT III – PM to Director of Requirements, Lead Command 3.8.4.  The  PM  coordinates  capability  requirements  documents  to  the  Lead  Command  and supporting  documentation  to  aid  requirements  traceability  to  the  RFP.    If  the  requirements document used in  conjunction  with  the final  RFP has previously been coordinated with the requiring  Lead  Command  at  the  appropriate  level,  there  is  no  need  to  re-accomplish coordination. 3.8.5.  Use a Systems Requirements Document (SRD) whenever warfighter/user capabilities and/or requirements are translated into acquisition requirements for a new contract in support of  a  system/sub-system  specification.    For  existing  contracts,  use  the  guidance  in  MIL-HDBK-520,  Systems  Requirements  Document  Guidance,  whenever  warfighter/user capabilities and/or requirements are translated into acquisition requirements.  For additional information  on  preparation  of  an  SRD  refer  to  MIL-HDBK-520.    Guidance  instructions  in MIL-HDBK-520 are tailorable as needed. 3.8.6.  Changes  to  the  requirements  documents  that  would  change  the  scope  of  a  non-FMS undefinitized contract action (UCA), and that will delay definitization, shall be approved by the SAE and the Head of the Contracting Activity (HCA). 3.9.  Development  RFP  Release  Decision.  To  meet  the  intent  and  requirements  of  the Development  RFP  Release  Decision,  ACAT  ID  and  IAM  programs  do  not  have  a  separate AFRB  and  ASP  for  programs  where  OSD  is  the  MDA.    The  AF  conducts  a  combined ASP/AFRB  with  no  further  review  prior  to  the  MDA  holding  the  review.    The  PM  ensures provisions for small business utilization are considered in the RFP and source selection criteria as practicable. More information and a Draft RFP template can be found on the AF Portal at the “SAF/AQXE - Execution/ Oversight” page in the Secretariat/AFRB section.  Other than the AS, planning documentation may be in approved draft format, per Chapter 4, for this review.  30 AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 3.10.  Request for  Reclassification  of  Acquisition  Programs  Categorization.  For reclassification  of  an  ACAT  I  or  IA  program  to  a  lower  ACAT,  the  SAE  submits  requests  to USD(AT&L).  The request identifies the reasons for the reduction in ACAT level. 3.10.1.  The PM shall notify the PEO and the SAE when it is  necessary to raise the ACAT category  to  a  higher-level  ACAT  category.    This  notification  is  made  immediately  upon determining  that  the  program  meets  the  requirements  of  the  higher  category  as  defined  in DoDI 5000.02. 3.10.2.  If  the  program  qualifies  as  an  ACAT  I  program,  the  program  is  assumed  to  be  an ACAT IC until USD(AT&L) requests the program become an ACAT ID per Section 825 of Pub. L. 114–92. 3.11.  Program Work Breakdown Structure (WBS).  The PM develops and tailors a Program WBS.  Detailed guidance on the work breakdown structures for defense materiel items is located in MIL-STD-881C, Work Breakdown Structure for Defense Materiel Items. 3.12.  Integrated  Master  Plans  (IMP)  and  Integrated  Master  Schedules  (IMS).  Refer  to DoDI 5000.02 and the DoD Integrated Master Plan and Integrated Master Schedule Preparation and Use Guide for additional information. 3.13.  Performance  Measurement  Baseline  (PMB)  Analysis.  The  PM  shall  perform  cost, schedule, and risk analysis of the contractor’s PMB to  assure continuing  progress  and program applicability.    The  PMB  should  contain  sufficient  detail,  account  for  all  scope,  and  reflect accurate  schedules.    The  PMB  is  reviewed  to  assess  implementation  of  the  contractor’s  earned value system via the Integrated Baseline Review (IBR) process. 3.14.  Earned  Value  Management  (EVM)/EVM  System  (EVMS).  EVM is a key integrating process  in  the  management  and  oversight  of  acquisition  programs  including  information technology programs.  The qualities and operating characteristics of the EVMS are described in American  National  Standards  Institute/Electronics  Industries  Alliance  (ANSI/EIA)  Standard–748.  The Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) is responsible for EVMS compliance and for ensuring the integrity and application effectiveness of the contractor’s EVMS. 3.14.1.  PMs will employ EVM/EVMS per DFARS subpart 234.2 and DoDI 5000.02. 3.14.1.1.  Waiving  EVM/EVMS  requires  SAE  and  Implementing  Command  Senior Contracting  Official  (SCO)  approval  per  AFFARS  5301.4  and  DoDI  5000.02.  Coordinate  requests  for  tailoring/waiving  EVM/EVMS  requirements  for  MDAPs  with SAF/AQX who, in turn, coordinates with the Performance Assessments and Root Cause Analyses  (PARCA)  EVM  Division.    SAE  waivers  should  be  obtained  prior  to implementing DFARS deviations. 3.14.1.2.  Include  EVM  applicability  with to  authorizing  documents (regulations,  policies,  instructions),  waivers,  and  business  case/cost  benefit  analysis  (if applicable) in the program AS documents submitted to the MDA. reference 3.14.2.  Where EVMS is required, the PM/PEO ensures that: 3.14.2.1.  The  solicitation  and  contract  contains  the  appropriate  DFARS  clauses  IAW DFARS  234.203  for  252.234-7002  (EVM)  and  DFARS  clause  252.234-7001  for 252.242-7005 (Contractor Business Systems).  AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 31 3.14.2.2.  The WBS is prepared based on MIL-STD-881C. 3.14.2.3.  The  IMP  is  prepared  based  on  the  latest  version  of  the  DoD  IMP/IMS Preparation and Use Guide. 3.14.2.4.  EVM is reported IAW DoDI 5000.02. 3.14.2.5.  Integrated  Baseline  Reviews  (IBRs)  are  conducted  IAW  DoDI  5000.02  and DFARS  clause  252.234-7002.    For  additional  information,  see  the  Air  Force  Integrated Baseline Review (IBR) Process Guide. 3.14.3.  EVM  integrates  the  cost,  schedule,  and  technical  requirements  of  the  program  and links  them  with  the  project's  risk  management  process.    The  PM  performs  the  following EVM analysis and reporting (reference DoDI 5000.02): 3.14.3.1.  Validate  compliance  of  Integrated  Program  Management  Report  (IPMR)  (or Contract  Performance  Report  on  older  contracts)  and  Contract  Funds  Status  Report (CFSR),  which  include  reconciliation  between  the  IPMR  and  CFSR,  with  contractual Contract  Data  Requirements  List  (CDRL)  requirements.    For  contracts  requiring submission  to  the  OSD  EVM  Central  Repository  (EVM-CR),  acceptance/rejection  of each document is IAW EVM-CR requirements. 3.14.3.2.  EVM performance analysis (cost/schedule variance, indices, schedule margins, critical/near  critical  path,  risks,  PMB  integrity,  etc.)  to  ensure  continuing  progress  and program applicability.  Based on this analysis, the PM develops a risk based independent Estimate at Completion (EAC). 3.14.3.3.  Prior  month  level-one  EVM  data  along  with  the  PM’s  independent  EAC  for each  contract  is  reported  in  Acquisition  Data  Systems  for  inclusion  in  the  Monthly Acquisition Report (MAR).  See Chapter 11 for more information. 3.14.4.  EVM Requirements for Over Target Baselines (OTB)/Over Target Schedules (OTS). 3.14.4.1.  An OTB is defined as an EVM baseline that exceeds contract value.  An OTS is defined as a schedule that exceeds the contractually required delivery dates. 3.14.4.2.  The PM shall  ensure SAF/AQ is  notified through the MAR  of  any  OTB/OTS prior to implementation and upon completion. 3.14.4.3.  Contractor  EVM  reporting  may  not  be  waived  while  implementing  an  over-target  baseline,  unless  otherwise  agreed  to  by  SAF/AQX.    At  a  minimum,  Actual  Cost Work Performed (ACWP) is reported in Format 1 during the OTB/OTS. 3.14.4.4.  Programs  implementing  an  OTB/OTS  will  conduct  a  subsequent  Integrated Baseline Review (IBR) on the revised baseline. 3.14.5.  Single Point Adjustment (SPA).  SPA, sometimes referred to as re-baselining, refers to  eliminating  cumulative  performance  variances  (setting  cost  and/or  schedule  variances  to zero).  SPAs are not  performed solely to  improve contract  performance  metrics.  Therefore SPAs  which  set  cost  variances  to  zero  are  not  permitted  without  the  execution  of  an  OTB formal reprogramming action or PEO authorization with coordination by SAF/AQX.   32 AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 3.15.  Affordability  Analysis.  All  ACAT  programs  require  an  Affordability  Analysis.    See DoDI 5000.02, Enclosure 8 for additional information. 3.15.1.  ACAT  I  and  IA.  Affordability  constraints  (goals  and  caps)  are  documented  in  an Enterprise  Affordability  Assessment  (EAA)  determined  by  comparing  life  cycle  cost estimates  against  future  AF  resource  allocations.  These  constraints  are  then  used  as  a  basis for conducting AF portfolio affordability analyses.  For ACAT I and IA programs, AF/A8X is  responsible  for  producing  EAAs  as  well  as  AF  portfolio  affordability  analyses.    PMs request  Affordability  Assessments  or  updated  Affordability  Assessments  from  SAF/AQX throughout  the  program  as  required  by  the  MDA.    SAF/AQX  coordinates  with  AF/A8X  to conduct the assessment. 3.15.2.  ACAT II and III.  The analysis completed as part of the PPBE and strategic planning processes, required to be completed annually, can meet the requirement for an affordability analysis  across  the  Future  Years  Defense  Program  (FYDP).    The  analysis  should  ensure program planning is consistent with the requiring Lead Command’s or functional sponsor’s current  portfolio  plans  and  strategies,  includes  approved  CSB  changes,  and  addresses resource implications beyond the FYDP. 3.15.3.  National  Guard  and  Reserve  Equipment  Account  (NGREA)  Funded.    A  PM executing, and MDAs reviewing, FYDP plus 5 year roadmaps for AFRC, ANG, and NGREA funded  programs  should  consider  that  there  is  a  risk  that  the  plan  will  need  to  be  updated, perhaps  significantly,  each  year  due  to  the  annual  fluctuations  in  Congressional  NGREA appropriations. 3.16.  Post  Implementation  Review  (PIR).  PIRs  will  be  executed  IAW  DoDI  5000.02.    For more information,  refer to AFMAN 17-1402, Air Force Clinger-Cohen Act (CCA) Compliance Guide. 3.17.  Independent  Reviews.  The  PEO  and  Implementing  Command/CCs,  with  SAF/AQ coordination,  may  conduct  independent  reviews  (e.g.,  Weapon  System  Enterprise  Reviews [WSER]  or  Acquisition  and  Sustainment  Reviews  [ASR])  of  programs  and  other  acquisition activities to gain insight to improve the acquisition and sustainment of weapons systems.  These reviews include recommendations with the intent to identify and address systematic problems in process,  training,  or  organization.    Independent  reviews  can  also  include  Independent  Program Assessments whenever directed by the MDA.  For best practices and schedule recommendations refer to AFPAM 63-128. 3.18.  Legal  Reviews.  The  PM  shall  ensure  that  reviews  for  legality  are  accomplished  for weapons  and  cyber  capabilities  IAW  AFI  51-402,  Legal  Reviews  of  Weapons  and  Cyber Capabilities, for all applicable acquisition and modification programs. 3.19.  Program  Terminations.  It  may  be  necessary  to  terminate  a  program  for  a  variety  of reasons  including  a  Presidential,  Congressional,  DoD,  or  AF  Leadership  decision,  change  in threat,  poor  contractor  performance,  or  withdrawal  of  funding.    The  termination  decision  and plan  shall  be  approved  by  the  MDA  and  documented  in  an  ADM.    SAF/AQC,  on  behalf  of SAF/AQ,  acts  as  the  AF  Department  liaison  for  terminations  per  DFARS  249.7001  and Procedures, Guidance and Information (PGI) 249.70, Special Termination Requirements. 3.19.1.  The  PM  shall  notify  the  HCA  and  SAF/AQC  of  all  ACAT  program  terminations upon the termination decision.  The PM also notifies SAF/SB if termination involves small  AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 33 businesses.  The HCA or SAF/AQC shall notify OSD when  applicable and coordinate with SAF/FMBL and SAF/LL to make Congressional notifications prior to termination actions. 3.19.2.  Upon termination decision, the PM shall develop a termination plan to describe how to  close  the  program  down  in  an  expeditious,  orderly  manner  with  the  least  impact  to  the government. 3.19.3.  For the termination plan templates, reference AFPAM 63-128.  34 AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 Chapter 4 PROGRAM ACTIVITIES 4.1.  Program  Integration.  It is a responsibility of all PMs to demonstrate and document how they  integrate  cost,  schedule  and  performance  information  into  program  decisions.    Successful program integration requires involvement of each functional expert within the program office to provide informed guidance and recommendations. 4.2.  Program  Documentation.  The  PM  is  responsible  for  completing  all  applicable  program documentation as outlined by statute and policy. 4.2.1.  Document  Content.    All  new  AF  programs  and  existing  programs  requiring  OSD oversight  ensure  documentation  is  prepared  consistent  with  OSD  approved  outlines.    For other programs,  the MDA determines how to  capture the information  requirements covered by  the  OSD  outlines.    Regardless  of  the  format  used  to  document  the  results,  the  PM  is responsible  for  ensuring  that  the  content  of  the  plans  meets  all  applicable  statutory  and regulatory requirements. 4.2.2.  Document Approval Authority.  Document approval authority is detailed in Table 4.1 for ACAT IC, IAC, II, and III programs.  ACAT ID and ACAT IAM programs follow OSD guidelines  concerning  approval  authority.    Table  4.1  details  the  organizations  required  to approve the document per statute and regulation, not coordination of the document. 4.2.2.1.  When  the  SAE  is  the  MDA,  the  SAF/AQ  military  or  principal  deputy  has signature authority for MDA approved documentation.  This applies to all documentation with the exception of the AS, ADM, and Acquisition Program Baseline (APB). 4.2.2.2.  If  draft  documentation  is  required  for  a  review,  the  document  should  be approved  at  the  level  below  the  approval  authority.    For  example,  if  the  SAE  is  the approval  authority,  then  the  document  should  be  approved  by  the  PEO  prior  to  the review. 4.2.3.  Document  Coordination.    The  PM  is  responsible  for  coordination  within  the  PEO chain.    Once  the  PEO  approves  the  document  it  should  be  sent  directly  to  the  Approval Authority  of  the  document  per  Table  4.1.    Prior  to  PEO  approval,  the  PM  should  also coordinate with any outside organization that will directly support the implementation of the plan.    Once  the  document  is  approved  by  the  PEO,  it  is  the  responsibility  of  the  Approval Authority to coordinate the document with any other HAF, MAJCOM, or other organization required  for the  Approval  Authority signature.   The Approval  Authority should consolidate comments  from  the  organizations  required  for  their  approval,  determine  if  the  document  is ready  for  signature,  concur  or  non-concur,  and  present  a  consolidated  view  to  the  PM  and PEO.  The only exception is for OSD approved documentation which should be coordinated IAW OSD direction. 4.2.3.1.  Offices  need  to  expedite  coordination  within  the  time  specified  by  the MDA/PEO/PM and either “concur” or “non-concur.”  Concurrence and coordination by all  parties  involved  may  not  be  necessary  for  an  MDA  to  make  a  decision.    However, staff packages should reflect the “non-concur” and stated reasons so the MDA can make a  fully  informed  decision.    Format  driven  changes  should  not  result  in  delaying  the  AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 35 coordination process. The PM, reviewing office, and staff should use automated tools, as available, to streamline coordination and approval. 4.2.3.2.  Coordinate documentation approved or requested by the DAE through the SAE. 4.2.4.  Document Storage.  The PM ensures program documentation is maintained and made available electronically, as applicable.  Acquisition documentation for all Legacy and ACAT I/IA,  II,  and  III  programs  will  be  retained  through  the  life  of  the  system  in  a  central repository.    The  recommended  central  repository  is  the  Acquisition  Information  Repository (AIR).  AIR also meets all requirements for official electronic records management. Table 4.1.  Document Approval Authority.   36  AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 4.3.  Acquisition  Strategy  (AS).  The AS is the overall life cycle strategy for the system.  The PM  develops  an  AS  that  documents  the  life  cycle  strategies  necessary  to  satisfy  statutory  and regulatory requirements under DoDI 5000.02.  For more information refer to AFPAM 63-128. 4.3.1.  The MDA shall approve to the AS prior to release of a formal solicitation. 4.3.2.  The PM ensures the AS is documented in sufficient detail to ensure that it meets the information requirements of the OSD approved AS outline or as tailored by the MDA. 4.3.3.  At  the  discretion  of  the  MDA,  the  AS  for  a  modification  may  be  an  annex  to  the existing and approved system AS.  Complete the annex IAW all AS requirements. 4.3.4.  Fact-of-life  changes,  such  as  updates  to  schedule  and  funding  adjustments,  do  not require  a  re-coordination  of  the  AS  unless  they  drive  a  significant  change  (e.g.,  change  in contract type, change in quantities) in the approved strategies or APB. 4.3.5.  Existing programs that do not currently have an AS shall transition to an AS when the program enters a new MS. 4.3.6.  For AF programs whose MDA authority has been delegated to the SAE and below and that have an approved Life Cycle Management Plan (LCMP) prior to March 2013, the MDA may  approve  the  continued  use  of  the  LCMP  for  the  life  of  the  program.    The  PM  ensures that  the  LCMP  meets  the  information  and  coordination  requirements  of  the  existing requirements of the AS and Life Cycle Sustainment Plan (LCSP) outlines.  Programs are not required to have a standalone AS and LCSP with an approved LCMP meeting the conditions of this paragraph. 4.4.  Acquisition Program Baseline (APB).  The PM ensures each program or increment has an APB establishing program goals—thresholds and objectives—for the minimum number of cost, schedule,  supportability,  and  performance  parameters  that  describe  the  program  over  its  life cycle.  Reference 10 U.S.C. §2433 and 10 U.S.C. §2435. 4.4.1.  The  original  APB  is  prepared  prior  to  the  program  entering  Engineering  and Manufacturing Development (EMD) or program initiation, whichever occurs later.  Review the  APB  at  each  subsequent  MS  decision  and  full  rate  production  to  determine  if updates/changes  are  necessary.    Update  the  APB  at  significant  or  critical  Nunn-McCurdy cost breaches or at MAIS Critical Changes. The APB is approved by the MDA. 4.4.2.  ACAT II and III programs are required to establish an APB.  All approved APBs will be stored in the central repository, per section 4.2.4.  See Chapter 11 of this AFI or AFPAM 63-128 for additional information. 4.5.  Program  Management  Agreement to communicate  issues,  common  program  processes,  and  vector  resources  to  ensure  they  are achievable and measurable and should be used as a basis for annual performance planning. (PMA).  The  PMA  establishes  a  means 4.5.1.  PMAs are required for ACAT I and IA PMs IAW DoDI 5000.02, and are encouraged for ACAT II and III PMs. 4.5.2.  The PMA is established between the PM and the PM’s immediate supervisor within 6 months  of  assignment  of  the  PM  and  kept  current  throughout  the  life  of  the  program.    The PMA  covers  the  period  of  the  PMs  tenure  agreement  or  assignment.  The  PMA  should  be  AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 37 updated at major decision points or as needed based on the condition of the requirements and changes in the program. 4.5.3.  PMA  format  will  be  at  the  PEO  discretion,  however  the  PMA  must  include/address certain  mandatory  elements  including  the  PMs  obligation  to  object  to  the  addition  of  new program requirements not approved by the CSB and the responsibility to recommend reduced requirements  to  the  CSB,  reference  DoDI  5000.02  for  additional  information.    It  must  be consistent with MS B parameters unless approved by the CSB. 4.6.  Risk-Based  Program  Management  and  Decision  Making.      PMs  for  all  programs, including  commercial-off-the-shelf  (COTS)  and  non-developmental  item  (NDI)  programs, identify, analyze, track and mitigate risks addressed during program reviews. 4.6.1.  The PM prepares a risk management plan (RMP) that documents the program’s use of standard  risk  management  processes  (reference  AFPAM  63-128  and  the  Department  of Defense  Risk,  Issue,  and  Opportunity  Management  Guide  for  Defense  Acquisition Programs).    Among  other  content,  the  RMP  addresses  how  the  program  is  performing  and integrating  the  following:    risk-based  source  selection,  cost,  schedule,  technical,  product support,  information  technology,  T&E,  operational,  threat,  acquisition  security,  ESOH,  and Human Systems Integration (HSI) risk management.  The RMP for space programs addresses risk-based performance for space debris mitigation assessments and documentation for space and  launch  systems  per  AFI  91-217,  Space  Safety  and  Mishap  Prevention  Program.    The RMP also describes the responsibilities of any cross-functional risk management Integration Product  Team  (IPT)  or  equivalent.    The  RMP  can  be  incorporated  into  the  AS  or  other appropriate  planning  document.    Link  the  RMP  to  the  risk  management  activities  in  other planning  documents  and  continually  update  the  risk  management  process  and  its implementation throughout the system’s life cycle. 4.6.1.1.  The  PM  shall  use  the  likelihood  criteria,  consequence  criteria,  and  5x5  risk matrix  provided  in  Attachment  3  to  evaluate,  document,  and  present  cost,  schedule, performance, and other program risks.  These likelihood and consequence criteria support risk comparability across programs.  However, if the PM determines that the criteria are not  appropriate  for  assessing  and  managing  a  particular  program’s  risks,  the  PM  may tailor  the  criteria,  if  approved  by  the  MDA  IAW  the  tailoring  guidance  in  Chapter  1.  Reference AFPAM 63-128 for more information. 4.6.1.2.  The  PM  will  prepare  risk  handling/mitigation  plans  for  all  identified  5x5  risk matrix high, moderate,  and selected low risks.   The PM shall ensure a mechanism is  in place  to  track  and  archive  all  risks  and  handling/mitigation  plans  throughout  the program’s life cycle. 4.6.1.3.  The  PM  presents  risk  information  as  a  part  of  all  program,  technical,  and  MS decision  reviews  or  to  support  other  decision  points.    On the  risk  matrix,  the  PM  plots, and is prepared to discuss, each of the program’s identified high and moderate risks and their  corresponding  handling/mitigation  plans.    The  PM  includes  all  High  and  Serious ESOH  risks  identified  using  MIL-STD-882E,  the  DoD  Standard  Practice  for  System Safety, plotted on the standard 5x5 matrix using the translation matrix in Attachment 3.  The  PM  coordinates  cybersecurity  risk  information  with  the  AO  prior  to  decision reviews.  The PM presents any AO non-concur as a risk at the decision review.  38 AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 4.6.2.  Risk-based  Source  Selection.    The  source  selection  approach,  as  part  of  the  AS,  is developed to select the right contractor to reduce risk over the life cycle of the program and get  the  best  business  deal  for  the  Air  Force.    This  includes  identifying  the  strengths, weaknesses,  domain  experience,  process  capability,  development  capacity,  and  past performance  for  all  contractor  team  members.    This  should  inform  key  technical  and appropriate program risks and the formulation of source selection evaluation criteria.  Source selection guidance and procedures are contained in FAR Part 15, DFARS Part 215, AFFARS 5315.3 and AFFARS Mandatory Procedure 5315.3. 4.6.3.  Cost Risk Management.  The PM has responsibility for cost risk management and may adjust  program  decisions  based  on  potential  cost  variation,  cost  uncertainties,  or  market research.    Identify  uncertainty  feeding  the  overall  programs'  costs  from  the  risks  and  risk handling/mitigation  activities  associated  with  prediction  of  future  costs  based  on  current knowledge of technical,  schedule and market  research.  Uncertainty in  this  case is  program risk  associated  with  the  ability  of  the  program  to  achieve  its  life  cycle  cost  objectives.    A program’s  cost  estimator has the  responsibility  for supporting  the PM’s integrated  cost  risk management efforts, utilizing methods and cost management principles outlined in AFPD 65-5, Cost and Economic, and AFI 65-508, Cost Analysis Guidance and Procedures. 4.6.4.  Schedule  Risk  Management.    The  PM  has  execution  responsibility  for  schedule  risk management  and  should  utilize  appropriate  tools  to  develop,  guide,  and  manage  associated risks.    Schedule  risk  includes  schedule  uncertainty  due  to  manufacturing,  contracting  and subcontracting,  testing,  government  rules/impediments,  uncertainty  in  work,  unrealistic schedules,  natural  causes,  and  complexity.    All  programs  maintain  an  Integrated  Master Schedule and review it frequently including analyzing a program’s “critical path” in order to determine  and  manage  potential  risks  associated  with  schedule  slips.    Reference  the  Air Force  Acquisition  Excellence  &  Change  Office  (SAF/AQXC)  Schedule  Risk  Assessment (SRA) Process for more information. 4.6.5.  Technical  Risk  Management.    The  CE,  in  support  of  the  PM,  has  execution responsibility for technical risk management, and utilizes systems engineering throughout the life cycle to manage program technical risks.  Technical risk management includes risk based prototype  planning  and  development.    Technical  risk  management  considers  design, manufacturing,  technology  maturity,  Intelligence  Mission  Data  (IMD),  cybersecurity  risks, integration,  interoperability  and  supportability,  testing  risks,  and  threats  to  mission  critical functionality and critical program information. 4.6.5.1.  The  CE,  in  support  of  the  PM,  should  identify  and  track  risks  associated  with achieving the  appropriate  Technology  Readiness  Levels  (TRLs)  of  all  critical technologies.  (Note: TRL values are indicators of technical  maturity  and  not  risk since they  are  unrelated  to  consequence  of  occurrence).    See  the  DoD  Technology  Readiness Assessment (TRA) Guidance for information on TRLs. 4.6.5.2.  The  CE  ensures  that  relevant  engineering  information  and  recommendations, including  underlying  assumptions  and  risks,  are  made  available  to  the  PM  and  senior leaders in the  ILCM  chain  of authority  IAW  DoDI 3200.20,  Scientific and Engineering Integrity. 4.6.5.3.  ESOH  Risk  Management.    The  PM  shall  use  MIL-STD-882E  methodology  to manage  ESOH  risks  as  part  of  SE  process  in  all  developmental  and  sustaining  AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 39 engineering  activities.    The  PM  shall  document  in  the  Programmatic  Environment, Safety,  and  Occupational  Health  Evaluation  (PESHE)  the  required  ESOH  risk  data.  PESHEs are not required for software programs with no hardware component, however if the PM determines software that supports hardware can create or impact ESOH risks then those risks will be documented in a PESHE.  ESOH risks must be formally accepted prior to  exposing  people,  equipment,  or  the  environment  to  known  system-related  ESOH hazards at any point in the system’s life cycle.  The ESOH risk acceptance authorities are the SAE for High risks,  PEO-level  for Serious risks,  and the PM for Medium and  Low risks.    These  authorities  cannot  be  delegated.    The  requirement  to  have  a  current  risk acceptance  applies  throughout  the  life  of  the  system.    This  may  require  multiple  risk acceptances for a given hazard.  Program risk acceptance packages and tracking are only necessary  for  those  risks  that  are  inside  the  design/specification/requirement  envelope. Those outside the envelope are handled by using the user’s/operator’s risk management process.  Formal ESOH risks acceptance includes: 4.6.5.3.1.  The Lead Command, as the User Representative, shall be part of the ESOH risk  acceptance  process  throughout  the  life  cycle  providing  input  to  all  risk acceptance decisions, and shall provide formal concurrence before a Serious or High risk can be accepted. 4.6.5.3.2.  Formal High risk acceptance packages shall be coordinated with the Lead Command  commander  and  AF  Chief  of  Safety  (AF/SE)  before  the  SAE  can  accept the risk. 4.6.5.3.3.  The  PM  shall  ensure  each  formal  High  and  Serious  risk  acceptance package  describes  the  hazard,  predicted  risk  consequence  and  probability,  available mitigation  measures,  costs  or  other  limitations  to  mitigation  implementation, proposed  mitigation  measures,  target  risk  after  implementation  of  proposed mitigation, the proposed acceptance period, and an assessment of the expected losses for the period of acceptance. 4.6.5.3.4.  The period of  a risk acceptance should be either the remaining  life of the system  if  no  mitigations  are  proposed,  or  the  period  for  implementation  of  the proposed mitigation(s) throughout the entire fleet plus sufficient time to validate the effectiveness of the implemented mitigation(s). 4.6.5.3.5.  The  risk  assessments  that  support  High  risk  acceptance  packages  must conform  to  the  guidance  in  MIL-STD-882E  and  use  the  suggested  risk  assessment layout in AFI 91-202.  Additionally, refer to AFI 91-217 for space systems. 4.6.5.3.6.  For  fielded  systems,  the  PM  shall  notify  the  SAE,  the  system  Lead Command  and  affected  Using  Command  Commanders  of  any  previously  unknown High  risk  within  24  hours  of  becoming  reasonably  confident  that  the  risk  level  is High. 4.6.5.3.6.1.  This  initial  notification  initiates  the  formal  risk  acceptance  process and constitutes an interim High risk acceptance for a time period specified by the PM  in  the  notification  and  does  not  have  to  comply  with  sections  4.6.5.3.1. through 4.6.5.3.5. 4.6.5.3.6.2.  Subsequent interim High risk acceptance notifications are required if  40 AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 a  specified  time  period  expires  before  the  PM  is  ready  to  submit  a  formal  risk acceptance package IAW sections 4.6.5.3.1. through 4.6.5.3.5. 4.6.5.3.6.3.  If at any point in this process either the Lead Command Commander is  unwilling  to  concur  with  a  High  risk  acceptance  or  the  SAE  is  unwilling  to accept the High risk, the fielded system must be removed from service.  However, if the Lead or Using Command Commanders determine that their mission will not allow  removal  from  service,  a  MAJCOM  commander  can  decide  to  accept  the High risk in  order to  continue to  operate some or all of the systems  within  their command. 4.6.5.3.7.  The AF Airworthiness System is one source of High risk identification for aircraft systems during fielding.  If the AF Technical Airworthiness Authority (TAA) issues  an  airworthiness  advisory  about  a  potential  High  risk  or  rescinds  a  military type  certificate  or  flight  release  for  an  aircraft  system,  the  AF  Airworthiness Authority shall notify the aircraft system's PM and Lead/Using Command(s), and the SAE within 24 hours.  The PM then assumes the lead for managing this as a High risk IAW the procedures in this section. 4.6.5.3.8.  For High risks on fielded aircraft systems that may result in loss of life or equipment,  the  PM  may  recommend  grounding  (as  defined  in  AFI  11-401)  as  risk avoidance at the initial High risk notification or at any time during the risk assessment process. 4.6.5.3.8.1.  If  any  High  risk  notification  contains  a  grounding  recommendation, the SAE shall, within 24 hours of issuance of the High risk notification, confirm the interim risk acceptance or, if the SAE is unwilling to accept the technical risk, recommend grounding to the Lead/Using Command(s). 4.6.5.3.8.2.  Lead  and  Using  Command  commanders  are  the  sole  authorities  for approving grounding of their portion of an AF fleet (IAW AFI 11-401).  A Lead or  Using  Command  commander's  disagreement  with  a  SAE’s  grounding recommendation  results  in  the  Lead  or  Using  Command  commander’s  formal acceptance  of  the  risk  associated  with  continuing  to  operate  the  aircraft  system with the High risk. 4.6.6.  Product  Support  Risk  Management.    The  PM,  with  support  from  the  PSM,  has execution responsibility for product support risk management and utilizes applicable logistics assessment  tools  throughout  the  life  cycle  of  the  program  to  manage  product  support  risks.  See Chapter 7 for required product support and logistics assessments. 4.6.7.  Information  Technology  Risk  Management.    The  Risk  Management  Framework (RMF)  for  DoD  IT  defines  the  process  in  which  all  DoD  IT  (to  include  all  systems  that receive, process, store, display, or transmit DoD information) meets the requirements found in the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA). 4.6.7.1.  DoD  IT  includes  DoD  IS,  PIT,  IT  services,  and  IT  products.    This  includes  IT supporting  research,  development,  test  and  evaluation  (T&E),  and  DoD-controlled  IT operated by a contractor or other entity on behalf of the DoD.  AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 41 4.6.7.2.  The  PM  ensures  all  systems  with  IT  implement  risk  management  procedures aligned  with  DoD  RMF  throughout  all  phases  of  the  life  cycle  IAW  DoDI  8500.01, Cybersecurity,  DoDI  8510.01,  AFPD  17-1,  Information  Dominance  Governance  and Management, and AFI 17-101. 4.6.7.3.  The PM coordinates RMF results with the AO throughout all phases of the life cycle. 4.6.7.4.  The  PM  provides  required  cybersecurity  documentation  to  the  AO  and  obtains authorization  from  the  AO  before  the  system  under  development  is  operated  and/or connected to any external network. 4.6.7.5.  For  all  AF  SCI  assets  and  data,  ISR  mission  assets  and  data  (regardless  of classification),  and  Guest  SCI/ISR  assets  and  data,  RMF  is  implemented  under  IC Directive 503. 4.6.8.  T&E  Risk  Management.    The  PM  has  execution  responsibility  for  T&E  risk management,  and  utilizes  both  system  engineering  and  T&E  processes  throughout  the  life cycle  to  manage  program  T&E  risks.    T&E  risk  management  considers  test  resources,  test schedule, certifications, and technical risks (to include the PM’s safety release) from a T&E perspective.  Refer to AFI 99-103 for more information on T&E processes. 4.6.9.  Risk  Management  for  Operations  and  Maintenance.    The  PM  assists  the  system operators and maintainers in the application of risk management by providing the assessment of  hazards  and  potential  handling/mitigation  measures.    Refer  to  AFI  90-802,  Risk Management, for more information. 4.6.10.  Threat Risk Management.  The PM consolidates threat assessments and projections, including  CIPs,  related  to  the  operational  environment  throughout  the  lifecycle  of  the program  IAW  AFI  14-111,  Intelligence  Support  to  the  Acquisition  Life  Cycle,  and  JCIDS.  The  PM  evaluates  impacts  using  programmatic  risk  management  processes  in  order  to include threats into program risk decisions. 4.6.11.  Acquisition  Security  Risk  Management.    The  PM  ensures  acquisition  security  risks are included in the design, build, testing, and life cycle of the program.  Acquisition security risk assessments consider the system’s intended  operational  environment  when determining vulnerabilities  emanating  from,  and  provided  to,  systems  with  which  the  system  interfaces (system of systems). 4.6.12.  HSI Risk Management.  The PM ensures that risks associated with the HSI domains (human  factors  engineering,  personnel,  habitability,  manpower,  training,  safety  and occupational health, and force protection and survivability) are addressed throughout the life cycle. 4.7.  Intellectual Property (IP) Strategy.  The PM shall assess long term IP rights requirements and corresponding acquisition strategies prior to initiating a RFP to acquire systems, subsystems, or  end-items  to  ensure  they  provide  for  rights,  access,  or  delivery  of  data  that  the  Government requires for systems sustainment and to maintain competition throughout the life cycle.  The PM addresses  the  IP  strategy  including  the  rationale  for  acquisition  and\or  non-acquisition  of  IP  at MSs,  ASPs,  and  reviews  and  documents  the  strategy  in  the  IP  Strategy  and  associated  data planning documents.  Source selections consider Government rights to data and include pricing  42 AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 options that correspond to the IP rights recommended as part of the IP strategy.  The burden of proof that data is proprietary lies with the contractor.  If not acquiring technical data, computer software  licenses,  or  associated  IP  rights  necessary  for  organic  support,  a  summary  of  the business case analysis justifying that decision is approved by the MDA.  The PM obtains legal counsel  when  addressing  IP  issues.    The  PM  reviews  the  government  requirement  for  IP throughout the life cycle of the system. 4.7.1.  The PM ensures the program IP strategy, including the performance work statement or SOW for development,  production, deployment,  and sustainment (for all applicable phases) includes appropriate IP requirements, access, and necessary deliverables, or options for data and equipment deliverables required to support: 4.7.1.1.  Organic source of repair and/or supply decisions. 4.7.1.2.  Government Core depot maintenance capability requirements. 4.7.1.3.  Expeditionary logistics footprint requirements. 4.7.1.4.  Engineering data requirements  needed for such activities as integrity programs, sustaining engineering, reliability management, and configuration management. 4.7.1.5.  TOs. 4.7.1.6.  Re-procurement/modification/upgrade. 4.7.1.7.  Demilitarization/Disposal. 4.7.1.8.  Modular open systems approach (MOSA). 4.7.1.9.  Cybersecurity strategies. 4.7.1.10.  Technology refreshment or enhancement. 4.7.1.11.  Training and training program information. 4.7.1.12.  Spare parts procurement. 4.7.1.13.  Testing and Evaluation. 4.7.1.14.  IMD production. 4.7.1.15.  Contractor Logistics Support. 4.7.1.16.  Supply Chain Management. 4.7.1.17.  Depot Level Reparable and consumables procurement. 4.7.1.18.  Support Equipment procurement and maintenance. 4.7.1.19.  Special Tools/Tooling. 4.7.1.20.  Diminishing Manufacturing Sources & Material Shortages (DMSMS). 4.7.2.  For  specific  guidance  and  regulations  concerning  minimum  government  specific license  rights,  technical  data,  and  computer  software  follow  the  regulations  and  guidance found  in  DFARS  Subpart  227.71  and  227.72.    For  more  information  reference  10  U.S.C. §2320 and §2321.  AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 43 4.7.3.  Computer  Software/Firmware.    Computer  software  is  any  set  of  instructions  that directs  a  computer  to  perform  specific  tasks  or  operations.  As  such,  software  includes computer  programs,  source  code,  source  code  listings,  databases,  metadata,  stubs,  drivers, object code listings, libraries, executable image files, test data and automated tests, electronic documentation,  design  details,  algorithms,  UML  use  cases  and  processes,  compilers, programming  languages,  flow  charts/sequence  diagram,  formulae,  and  related  material  that would enable the software system to  be modified, executed/run, tested, reproduced, loaded, cloned/recreated,  recompiled,  and  maintained.    Firmware  is  a  specific  type  of  computer software  that  provides  control,  monitoring,  and  manipulation  of  system  devices  such  as computer  peripherals  and  mobile  devices,  and  is  stored  in  non-volatile  memory  such  as ROM, EPROM, and flash memory. 4.7.3.1.  The  PM  ensures  that  computer  software  is  acquired  as  executable  code  and source  code  unless  documented  and  approved  by  MDA.    When  the  contractor  is unwilling  to  provide  source  code  as  a  deliverable,  the  PM  considers  software  escrow arrangements using mutually agreed to third-party escrow agents. 4.7.3.2.  Software  Transition  Plan.    The  PM  provides  the  PCO  with  the  software  plan provisions  for  inclusion  into  the  RFP,  which  identify  the  hardware,  software  and  other resources  needed  for  life  cycle  support  of  deliverable  software  and  requires  the developer’s  plans  for  transitioning  deliverable  items  necessary  for  software  sustainment to the AF. 4.7.3.3.  The  IP  Strategy  addresses  the  potential  for  changes  in  computer  software sustainment over the life cycle of the system or subsystem.   RFPs and contracts  should contain deferred ordering provisions, when a firm requirement for a particular computer software item(s) has not been established prior to contract award but there is a potential need (e.g., organic sustainment) for the data. 4.7.4.  Life  Cycle  Management  of  Digital  Product  Design  Data.    The  PM  generates  digital product  design  data  and/or  requires  delivery  of  contractor-generated  digital  product  design data as part of the program’s IP strategy.  The PM shall: 4.7.4.1.  Utilize  MIL-STD-31000,  Technical  Data  Packages  and  Product  Data Specification  (Air  Force  Drawing  9579776)  to  structure  contract  requirements  for deliverable product design data. 4.7.4.2.  Provide digital product design data, during O&S, to a DoD standardized product data management system (e.g. the Joint Engineering Data Management Information and Control System) for common government storage, maintenance, access, and control.  If a prime  contractor  central  repository  is  used  instead  of  a  government  maintained  and controlled facility, appropriate data access and retrieval rights for government personnel must be ensured through specified inclusion in the contract. 4.7.4.3.  Maintain  updated  digital  product  design  data  in  the  standardized  system throughout O&S. 4.7.4.4.  Document in the IP Strategy the rationale for deviations (if any) from the above technical data requirements.  44 AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 4.8.  Test  Planning.  The  PM  establishes  an  ITT  after  MDD,  develops  and  documents  test planning  and  the  level  of  test  support  required  for  the  life  cycle  of  the  system,  and  conducts readiness  reviews  IAW  AFI  99-103  and  AFMAN  63-119,  Certification  of  Readiness  for Dedicated  Operational  Test  and  Evaluation.    The  PM  should  be  aware  of  test  and  evaluation planning  requirements  and  make  provisions  within  contracts,  reference  OSD’s  guide  on Incorporating  Test  and  Evaluation  into  Department  of  Defense  Acquisition  Contracts  for  more information. 4.8.1.  Test  and  Evaluation  Master  Plan  (TEMP).    The  PM,  working  through  the  Integrated Test Team, prepares a TEMP prior to MS A for applicable programs IAW AFI 99-103.  The ITT  forwards  the  final  draft  TEMP  to  the  PM  for  approval  and  assists  with  subsequent coordination to all required organizations below the Air Staff level. 4.8.1.1.  The SAE will coordinate on all TEMPs for all ACAT I, IA, and programs on the DOT&E  oversight  list  and/or  on  the  DASD(DT&E)  engagement  list  and/or  the USD(AT&L)  special  interest  program  list  and  forward  to  DOT&E  for  review  and signature and Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for DT&E for review and comment prior  to  USD(AT&L)  for  approval.    Once  coordination  is  completed,  the  PEO  will forward the TEMP to AF/TE and SAF/AQ for AF approval. 4.8.1.2.  The  MDA  is  the  approval  authority  for  delegated  ACAT  II  and  ACAT  III programs not on OSD T&E Oversight. 4.8.2.  Live Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&E).  SAE shall recommend candidate systems to DOT&E for compliance with LFT&E legislation.  PMs with a “covered system,” as defined in 10 USC § 2366(e), will contact OSD/DOT&E’s Live Fire T&E office to determine live-fire applicability.  SAE approves agreed-upon LFT&E programs and allocate operational AF resources  required  to  accomplish  LFT&E  plans.    Additionally,  the  SAE  forwards  required LFT&E  documentation  and  waivers  (if  appropriate)  to  OSD/DOT&E,  which  then  go  to USD(AT&L) for approval. 4.8.3.  T&E  Considerations.    The  PM  ensures  that  DT&E  and  Operational  Test  and Evaluation  (OT&E)  considerations  are  addressed  throughout  the  life  cycle.    PMs,  with  the CDT/TM, establish a structured strategy for T&E and a process to provide early feedback to the  requirements  and  acquisition  processes.    The  PM  implements  the  dedicated  OT  review process  as  described  in  AFMAN  63-119  and  briefs  the  MDA  who  will  certify  system readiness for IOT&E.  Refer to AFI 10-601 and AFI 99-103 for more information. 4.9.  Modeling  and  Simulation  (M&S).  The  PM  plans  and  resources  for  the  appropriate application of M&S capabilities early and throughout the life cycle.  Refer to DoDI 5000.02, AFI 16-1001,  Verification,  Validation  and  Accreditation  (VV&A),  and  AFI  16-1005,  Modeling  & Simulation Management for more information. 4.9.1.  Ensure  models,  simulations,  and  associated  data  supporting  acquisition  processes, products, and decisions meet the appropriate verification and validation requirements and are accredited  for  their  intended  use  (reference  AFI  16-1001).    The  infrastructure  necessary  to support  system  design  and  integration  includes  government-owned  centers  for  live,  virtual, and constructive (LVC) simulation, as well as contractor system integration facilities.  To the maximum extent possible, the PM should leverage existing LVC assets.  AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 45 4.9.2.  The  PM  works  with  Lead/Using  Command,  operational  requirements  advocate(s), developmental  and  operational  testers,  the  IC,  the  S&T  community  and  other  relevant organizations to develop and implement  a M&S strategy leading to M&S products that can be transitioned and used throughout the acquisition life cycle, including in T&E and training. 4.9.2.1.  The PM documents the M&S strategy in the appropriate program documentation dependent  upon  the  usage  of  M&S.    The  PM  ensures  M&S  capabilities  support  LVC-Operational Training (LVC-OT) requirements.  AFI 99-103 defines M&S considerations for T&E. 4.9.2.2.  The  M&S  strategy  describes  how  the  use  of  M&S  benefits  the  program  and addresses  how the  program  meets  DoD  M&S  mandates  such  as  reusability, interoperability,  adoption  of  standards,  and  promoting  visibility  of  M&S  capabilities, resources and data. 4.9.2.3.  The M&S strategy should describe how the PM is to obtain sufficient M&S data to  adequately  characterize  the  technical  and  operational  capabilities  of  the  system.  Programs  should obtain  data and models from authoritative sources when available and feasible. 4.9.3.  PMs should consult their local organic M&S agencies (e.g., Simulation and Analysis Facility  within  AFMC,  National  Air  and  Space  Intelligence  Center  for  threat  M&S,  and AFRL Enterprise M&S) and the AF Agency for M&S to identify resources (e.g., capabilities, V&V  status,  and  future  plans)  that  can  be  utilized  by  the  program  instead  of  developing unique M&S tools. 4.10.  General  Equipment  Valuation.      General  Equipment  Valuation  is  a  DoD  initiative  to capitalize, and depreciate assets, including modifications, to meet federal accounting standards as defined in DoDI 5000.64, Accountability and Management of DoD-Owned Equipment and Other Accountable Property, DoDI 5000.02, and DoD 7000.14-R. 4.10.1.  The  PM  accounts  for  all  General  Equipment  assets  subject  to  capitalization  and depreciation. 4.10.2.  General  Equipment  is  defined  in  DoD  7000.14-R  and  includes  military  equipment, non-military equipment, Government Furnished Property (GFP), IT assets, and Internal Use Software (IUS). 4.10.3.  The  PM  shall  include  a  General  Equipment  program  description  as  part  of  the  AS.  At MS C (or any other decision point that leads to production or procurement of end items to be used for operations) for any program, project, product, or system that has deliverable end items  that  meet  the  capitalization  threshold,  ensure  the  program’s  General  Equipment description identifies the following deliverables at a detail level consistent with level 2 of the Program  WBS  (detailed  guidance  on  the  work  breakdown  structures  for  defense  materiel items is located in MIL-STD-881C): 4.10.3.1.  The assets meeting the capitalization thresholds. 4.10.3.2.  The GFP or material that will be included in the assets.  See the Process Guide for Accountability of Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) for more information. 4.10.3.3.  Other deliverables that accompany the assets (e.g., manuals or tech data).  46 AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 4.10.3.4.  Other types of deliverables purchased with program funding (e.g., initial spares or support equipment), but that cannot be directly attributed to a specific asset. 4.10.4.  The  PM  ensures  proper  accounting  and  contractual  allocation  of  program expenditures between capitalized assets and expenses.  This is completed for every program, project,  product,  or  system  that  has  deliverable  assets.    Detailed  guidance  on  accounting policy and procedures may be found in DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 4. 4.10.4.1.  The PM ensures the gross book value of equipment assets and modification to those assets are provided IAW AFI 21-103, Equipment, Inventory, Status and Utilization Reporting. 4.10.4.2.  The PM also ensures the useful life of the assets and modification programs are also provided IAW AFI 21-103. 4.10.5.  The PM shall ensure Chief Financial Officer (CFO) reporting data elements (the full cost  value  and  useful  life)  for  military  equipment  assets  and  modifications  over  $1  million are recorded in the Reliability and Maintainability Information System (REMIS) upon initial delivery.  The  PM  shall update  REMIS  with  CFO  reporting  data  elements  upon  notification by  the  Aerospace  Vehicle  Distribution  Officer  (AVDO)  when  inventory  items  are  added, removed, or adjusted as a result of modifications.  The PM shall ensure the performance of monthly data reconciliations and automated attestation in REMIS for weapon system assets and  qualified  modifications  annually.  REMIS  is  the  CFO  compliant  system  used  in equipment  valuation  and  reporting  through  the  Defense  Finance  and  Accounting  System.  Refer to AFI 21-103 for additional guidance. 4.10.6.  The  PM  shall  provide  the  Procuring  Contracting  Officer  (PCO)  with  the  military evaluation requirements so the PCO can create the proper contract line item number (CLIN) and sub-line item number (SLIN) to reflect the distinction necessary to facilitate appropriate financial accounting treatment of the equipment to be acquired. 4.10.7.  The  PM  shall  ensure  all  Government  property  is  accounted  for  in  the  correct Accountable  Property  Systems  of  Record  (APSR)  IAW  AFI  23-111,  Management  of Government  Property  in  Possession  of  the  Air  Force,  to  support  their  program,  to  include property in the possession of contractors. 4.10.8.  Accountability  for  assets  in  which  title  has  passed  but  delivery  to  the  DoD  has  not yet  occurred  will  be  maintained  through  a  Construction  In  Process  account.    See  DoD 7000.14-R  for  procedures).    This  account  may  reside  in  either  the  DoD  Component accounting  system  or  the  Component  APSR.  Upon  delivery,  accountable  property  records will be established as appropriate in the APSR. 4.11.  Government  Cost  Estimates.  The  PM  is  responsible  for  updating  life  cycle  cost estimates  IAW  AFPD  65-5,  Cost  and  Economics,  AFI  65-502,  Inflation,  AFI  65-508,  Cost Analysis  Guidance  and  Procedures,  and  AFMAN  65-506,  Economic  Analysis.    The  PM  will compare  cost  estimates  to  the  program  budget  to  assess  program  executability.    The  PM  shall ensure current technical and programmatic data is provided to Cost Estimators in support of life cycle  cost  estimates.    See  DoD  7000.14-R,  Vol.  2A  for  more  details.    Note:  PM  responses  to external inquiries should use official cost estimates; consult AFI 65-508.  AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 47 4.11.1.  The  PM  shall  provide  cost  estimates  at  the  identified  confidence  level  to  the  MDA during reviews.  To the greatest extent possible, the PM identifies the Total Ownership Cost (TOC) and the major drivers to this cost.  Realistic program planning assumptions should be developed to ensure adequate analysis of life cycle cost, schedule, and performance risks, to be documented in the Program Office Estimate (POE). 4.11.1.1.  For cost estimates that provide a range of potential costs, the PM should assess that  range  for  the  associated  risks  to  the  program.    Establish  each  cost  estimate  and associated  risk  assessment  using  approved  AF  cost  estimating  procedures  and  consider technical,  schedule,  and  programmatic  risk  assessments  to  produce  a  cost  estimate distribution  or,  where  a  distribution  cannot  be  computed,  a  range  of  potential  program costs. The MDA for an ACAT I or II program uses the cost estimate distribution and cost estimate confidence to establish a sufficient program funding level.  The selection of the appropriate  program  cost  estimate  confidence  level  is  at  the  discretion  of  the  MDA, however, IAW AFI 65-508, the PM will establish a confidence level and document in the ADM and other deliverables/documents as necessary. 4.12.  Program  Funding.  Authority  is  delegated  to  SAF/AQX  to  direct  the  implementation  of programs  in  the  Research,  Development,  Test  and  Evaluation;  Aircraft;  Missile;  Space; Ammunition;  and  Other  Procurement  appropriations.    SAF/AQX  direction  is  provided  through Program  Authorization  (PA)  documents  which  request  formal  allocation  of  resources  to modernization  programs  and  subprograms.    SAF/FMB  issues  Budget  Authorization  (BA) funding  documents  to  MAJCOMs  and  other  Air  Force  field  activities  (ref  AFI  65-601,  Budget Guidance and Procedures, Vol. 1). 4.12.1.  Programs  submit  requests  for  PA  adjustments  (via  the  associated  AQ  Capability Directorate)  when  authorizations  are  inconsistent  with  program  requirements,  or  when necessary  to  meet  critical  requirements.    SAF/AQX  authorizes,  via  issuance  of  PA documents, execution-year adjustments to program funding, to include release/withdrawal of funds, and subprogram level funding realignments. 4.12.2.  SAF/AQX  coordinates  on  all  investment  New  Start  actions,  Below  Threshold Reprogramming  (BTR),  and  Above  Threshold  Reprogramming  (ATR)  actions,  prior  to submittal to the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Financial Management) (SAF/FM) and Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Legislative Liaison) (SAF/LL). 4.13.  New Start Notification.  A New Start is any program, subprogram, modification, project, or subproject not previously justified to and funded by Congress in a given appropriation through the  normal  budget  process.    When  a  determination  has  been  made  that  the  efforts  undertaken meet the New Start criteria, Congress is notified via either a Letter of Notification or DD1415-1 (Prior Approval Reprogramming Action).  The methods of notification to be used are delineated in  AFI  65-601,  Vol.  1  and  DoD  7000.14-R,  Vol.  3,  Ch.  6.    Additional  guidance  on  new  start business rules can be provided by SAF/FMBI. 4.13.1.  New  Start  Validation  Responsibilities.    The  PM  and  the  respective  Program  Office CFO are required to document and validate that efforts underway have obtained approval for new start or have been adequately assessed and determined not to meet the new start criteria before any funds are obligated for programs not categorized as “commodity” programs.  Pre-contract  cost  agreements  are  subject  to  new  start  criteria  and  require  completion  of  the  48 AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 validation  form.    RFPs,  proposal  evaluations,  and  contract  negotiations  are  part  of  normal Program Office activities and therefore, do not represent new start activities. 4.13.1.1.  Refer to AFI 65-601, Vol. 1 and DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 3, Ch. 6 for additional guidance on the key points delineated in the Validation Form in AFPAM 63-128. 4.13.1.2.  If  no  item  in  the  Validation  Form  is  marked  “YES,”  the  PM  works  with  the respective PEM and/or CD at the HAF to coordinate the initiation of the appropriate New Start  Notification  package  (i.e.,  Letter  of  Notification/1415-1  Packages).    Once  the Validation Form is completed, file it as part of the program’s contract file. 4.13.2.  Validation Form Exemptions.  Funding actions for the following are excluded from the  requirement  to  complete  the  validation  form  prior  to  obligating  funds.    The  exemption from  completing  the  validation  form  does  not  absolve  activities  from  complying  with  all regulations pertaining to New Start Notifications in the event that a New Start is planned for initiation. 4.13.2.1.  All  Basic  Research  (6.1),  Applied  Research  (6.2),  and  Advanced  Technology Development  (6.3)  efforts  in  Budget  Activities  1,  2,  &  3,  UNLESS  initiating  a  new research project (budget program activity code) that is not a transfer of an existing effort nor  listed  in  the  applicable  descriptive  summary  (R-2  exhibit).    These  exemptions  DO NOT  include  program  elements  (PEs)  beginning  with  a  63  designation,  but  do  include those falling under another Budget Activity Development and Prototypes budget program activity code. 4.13.2.2.  All Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I and II efforts.  See AFI 61-102 for more information. 4.13.2.3.  Incremental funding actions for ongoing efforts if no change in required work. 4.13.2.4.  Contract changes pursuant to clauses that do not change the work requirement of the contract (i.e., award fees and some price adjustments). 4.13.2.5.  Program  management  and  administrative  efforts  directed  at  business management and Program Office operations. 4.13.2.6.  O&M funded efforts. 4.13.3.  Reference  AFI  65-601,  Vol.  1  for  details  on  the  New  Start  Notification  process, procedures, and reporting requirements.  In addition, individuals can contact SAF/AQXE and SAF/FMBI for additional guidance and/or help regarding New Starts specific issues. implement  Will-Cost 4.14.  Will-Cost  and  Should-Cost  Management.  The  PM  shall Management  and  Should-Cost  Management  for  all  ACAT  I,  II,  and  III  programs  at  MS  A  and throughout their lifecycle.  Refer to DoDI 5000.02 for more information on Should Cost. 4.14.1.  Will-Cost and Should-Cost estimates are required at MS decisions for all ACAT I, II, and III programs and are updated as necessary. 4.14.2.  Will-Cost. 4.14.2.1.  AFI 65-508 identifies specific requirements for Will-Cost estimates or Service Cost Positions in support of ACAT I MS decisions.  AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 49 4.14.2.2.  ACAT II and III programs present Will-Cost estimates that have been approved by  the  appropriate  financial  management  cost  estimating  organization  at  each  MS decision. 4.14.2.3.  The non-advocate Will-Cost estimate is used as the basis for all budgeting and programming decisions. 4.14.2.4.  Under unique circumstances, programs may be waived from conducting annual Will Cost Estimate updates.  More information on this process can be found in AFI 65-508.  4.14.3.  Should-Cost. 4.14.3.1.  The  PM  develops  Should-Cost  estimates  and  seeks  assistance  from  outside organizations  (e.g.,  SAF/AQX,  SAF/AQC,  AF  Cost  Analysis  Agency  and  the  Defense Contract  Management  Agency)  throughout  the  development  process.  This  effort  should employ cross-functional teams, where practical, to perform detailed assessments on every ACAT I, II, and III program. 4.14.3.2.  The  PM  for  ACAT  I,  II  and  III  programs  presents  Should-Cost  estimates  at each MD decision.  For ACAT II and III programs, the MDA has the authority to approve the use of the POE in lieu of an approved Will Cost estimate in order to establish Should-Cost  Management  as  early  as  possible  in  the  program  life  cycle.    Additionally,  MDAs review and approve Should-Cost estimates for ACAT II and III programs. 4.14.3.3.  Under  unique  circumstances,  programs  may  be  waived  from  conducting Should-Cost  Management.    These  programs  must  submit  a  Should-Cost  Waiver, following the instruction provided in the SAF/AQ’s Should-Cost Management Guidance and Business Rules.  Note: Programs categorized as a Low Cost Modifications, Service Bulletin,  or  Urgent  Capability  Acquisitions  are  waived  from  Should-Cost  Management requirements, to include reporting per SAF/AQ Business Rules for Should Cost. 4.14.4.  Schedule Assurance.  RESERVED 4.15.  Use  of  Specifications  and  Standards.  Consistent  with  the  DoDI  4120.24,  Defense Standardization  Program  (DSP),  and  the  AF  Standardization  Program  (refer  to  AFI  60-101, Materiel  Standardization),  balance  decisions to  standardize  against  specific  mission requirements,  technology  growth,  and  cost  effectiveness.    Use  specifications  and  standards  in solicitations  and  contracts  to  define  essential  standard  practices  (e.g.,  system  safety  and  parts management)  and interoperability  and  support requirements) and to manage risk.  In support of this, the office of the Air Force Standardization Executive has developed portfolio-specific standardization document lists that can be used; refer to  AFPAM63-128.    Specific  DoD  policy  on  the  use  of  specifications  and  standards  and  other methods  to  achieve  objectives  required  by  10  U.S.C.  §2451-2457,  DoDI  2010.06,  Materiel Interoperability  and  Standardization  with  Allies  and  Coalition  Partners,  DoDD  5000.01,  and DoDI  5000.02  are  contained  in  DoDM  4120.24  procedures.  Additional  guidance  on  the  use  of specifications and standards in architecting is contained in AFI 17-140, Air Force Architecting. (e.g.,  materiel technical requirements 4.16.  Intelligence  Supportability.  The  first  step  in  the  acquisition  intelligence  process  is  the determination  of  the  intelligence  sensitivity  of  the  program  by  the  Implementing  Command’s  50 AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 intelligence  focal  point,  in  conjunction  with  the  PM  and  other  stakeholders.  If  a  program  is identified as intelligence-sensitive, the PM, in collaboration with the Implementing Command’s designated  intelligence  focal  point  and  other  stakeholders  to  include  but  not  limited  to  AF/A2, the  operating  command  intelligence  representatives,  and  the  intelligence  production  centers, develops and documents requirements and level of intelligence support required for the life cycle of  intelligence-sensitive  programs  IAW  and  as  defined  in  AFI  14-111  and  AFI  14-205, Geospatial  Information  and  Services.    The  PM  uses  the  results  of  Intelligence  Supportability Analysis  to  develop  and  document  requirements  (to  include  CIPs  and  IMD),  the  level  of intelligence support, the integration of intelligence information into the program decision making and system engineering, and to involve any applicable Foreign Military Sales stakeholders. 4.16.1.  The  PM  engages  with  the  Implementing  Command  designated  intelligence  focal point  for  SAP  or  special  access  initiatives.    The  PM  collaborates  with  the  designated intelligence  focal  points  to  develop  and  document  requirements  and  level  of  intelligence support required for the life cycle of the system IAW AFI 14-111 and AFI 14-205.  Note: Per applicability section of this publication, SAP programs shall be coordinated with SAF/AQL. 4.16.2.  The  PM  develops  the  Life  Cycle  Mission  Data  Plan  (LMDP)  for  each  acquisition program dependent on IMD, in conjunction with the Implementing Command’s intelligence focal  point,  beginning  at  MS  A.    DoD  Directive  5250.01,  Management  of  Intelligence Mission  Data  (IMD),  requires  the  LMDP,  previously  known  as  the  Life  Cycle  Signature Support Plan, in DoD Acquisitions.  A template for LMDPs can be found in AFI 14-111. 4.16.2.1.  The LMDP, developed for MS A and, at a minimum, updated at each MS, shall be  approved  by  the  PEO  for  ACAT  I  and  II  programs  or  MDA  for  ACAT  III  or  as delegated IAW statute and regulation.  The PM submits ACAT I LMDPs to the SIPRnet AIR  which  can  be  found  at  https://dodtechipedia.smil.mil.    SAP  and  Top  Secret (TS)/SCI  LMDPs  shall  be  disseminated  as  identified  in  the  LMDP  outline  through appropriate communications channels. 4.16.2.2.  IMD  requirements  are  to  be  documented  and  submitted  for  IC  action  via  a production requirement through the designated intelligence focal point prior to each MS decision.    Program  requirements  communicated  as  part  of  a  multi-program  IMD production request should not be duplicated or submitted independently from the multi-program  requirement.    Furthermore,  programs  will  participate  in  the  annual  AF  IMD requirements prioritization process for inclusion in a consolidated AF IMD priorities list.  This  list  will  be  formalized  into  a  prioritized  AF  IMD  production  request  for  action  by Service  Intelligence  Production  Centers  (SIPCs).    Prior  to  LMDP  approval,  the  PM provides the LMDP to the Implementing Command, Using Command, HAF/A2 offices, and  National  Air  and  Space  Intelligence  Center  (NASIC).    LMDP  waiver  authority resides at AF/A2. 4.16.2.3.  Intelligence  products  and  services  required  for  IMD-dependent  acquisition programs  and  efforts  are  produced  by  the  DoD  Intelligence  Production  Centers  unless waivers  are  coordinated  by  the  USD(I),  approved  by  the  MDA,  and  documented  in  an ADM.    The  PM  ensures  that  the  program  is  designed  to  use  existing  IC-defined  data standards for IMD.  AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 51 4.16.3.  Critical  Intelligence  Parameter  (CIP)  Processes.    CIPs  are  factors  which  clearly define  the  threshold  at  which  the  performance  of  a  foreign  system  or  capability  could compromise the program or mission effectiveness of the US system. 4.16.3.1.  Defining Program CIPs.  The PM ensures that the requirements sponsor, DoD component  capability  developer,  and  IC  representatives  collaboratively  establish program-specific  CIPs  for  validated  capability  requirements  and  acquisition  programs IAW  AFI  14-111.    CIPs  should  be  characteristics  of  adversary  threat  and  operational capabilities  which  are  a  factor  in  establishing  capability  requirements  and  associated initial objective performance values.  CIPs should be objective, quantifiable, measurable, specific, and of high impact to the program, such that they influence system development and tradeoffs.  CIPs should be developed as early as possible in the capability’s life cycle when it can be determined which Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) and Key System Attributes  (KSA)  are  threat  sensitive.  The  Lead  and  Implementing  Command  will collaboratively define their CIP reporting thresholds for threat-sensitive KPPs and KSAs of  the  planned  capability.    The  PM  ensures  CIPs,  once  developed,  are  tasked  for monitoring  by  the  IC  through  NASIC  as  the  AF's  Service  Intelligence  Center  or  by  the appropriate SAP intelligence production organization. 4.16.3.2.  CIP Breach.  If a CIP is breached at any point in the programs life cycle (e.g., a foreign system has met a CIP threshold) all materiel and/or non-materiel (i.e., Doctrine, Organization,  Training,  Leadership/Education,  Personnel,  Facilities,  or  Policy)  impacts are  reviewed  to  determine  appropriate  responses  and/or  risk  mitigation  efforts.    The program  will  likely  require  additional  time  and  funds  to  adjust  (i.e.,  “re-baseline”),  and spiral/increment  thresholds,  objectives,  KPPs,  KSAs,  etc.  may  require  adjustment  or modification.    The  PM  notifies  the  PEO,  MDA,  and  Implementing  Command’s intelligence  focal  point  if  a  CIP  threshold  is  reported  as  breached  by  the  appropriate supporting Service Intelligence Center (e.g., NASIC).  A CSB, as detailed in Chapter 3, determines if any follow-on action is required. 4.16.4.  The PM, working with the Implementing Command intelligence focal point, requests a  Validated  Online  Lifecycle  Threat  (VOLT)  document  from  NASIC  in  support  of  MDD, MS  A,  Development  RFP  Release,  MS  C,  and  FRP/FD  Decision  in  accordance  with  DoDI 5000.02.    NASIC  will  produce  ACAT  ID/IAM  VOLTs  for  AF-led  programs  using  DIA-validated  threat  data  in  accordance  with  DIAI  5000.002,  Intelligence  Threat  Support  for Major Defense Acquisition Programs. 4.17.  Arms  Control  Compliance.  The  PM  ensures  all  activities  within  the  acquisition  life cycle  are  compliant  with  all  US  Government  arms  control  obligations  IAW  AFI  16-601, Implementation  of,  and  Compliance  With,  International  Arms  Control  and  Nonproliferation Agreements and AFI 16-608, Implementation of and Compliance with the New Start Treaty. This assessment occurs prior to all MS reviews or when concerns arise, whichever is earlier. 4.17.1.  If necessary, the PM submits relevant Arms Control Compliance documents for their programs  and  activities,  prior  to  program  review  MSs  and  when  required  throughout  the program’s  life  cycle,  to  the  AF  Strategic  Stability  &  Countering  Weapons  of  Mass Destruction (WMD) Division (AF/A10-S), or an AF/A10-S-designated organization.  52 AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 4.17.2.  The  PM  ensures  the  program  is  reviewed  for  arms  control  compliance,  to  include New Start Treaty compliance, and obtains a certificate of review from AF/A10-S for program review MSs. 4.17.3.  A PM who oversees acquisition programs involving strategic weapons (e.g., bombs, warheads),  their  delivery  vehicles  (e.g.,  ballistic  missiles,  bombers,  and  cruise  missiles, including  their  associated  basing,  testing,  and  launch/control  facilities),  or  chemical  and biological  weapon  defense-related  materials  and  equipment  should  become  aware  of  the implications  and  limitations  that  arms  control  treaties  may  have  on  or  impact  their program(s). 4.18.  Procurement  Fraud.  The  PM the  AF  Office  of  Special Investigations, Deputy General  Counsel  for Contractor Responsibility (SAF/GCR), Contracting Officer, and the AFLOA Fraud Branch of any actual or suspected procurement fraud.  Reference AFI 51-1101, The Air Force Procurement Fraud Remedies Program for more information. immediately  notifies 4.19.  Urgent Capability Acquisition.  Urgent Capability Acquisition includes rapid acquisition programs  responding  to  an  approved  Joint  Urgent  Operational  Need  (JUON),  Joint  Emergent Operational  Need  (JEON),  Urgent  Operational  Need  (UON),  Quick  Reaction  Capabilities (QRC),  or  Top-Down  direction  IAW  applicable  10-Series  publications,  DoDI  5000.02,  and DoDD 5000.71, Rapid Fulfillment of Combatant Commander Urgent Operation Needs.  Urgent Capability  Acquisition  programs  are  ACAT  programs  and  required  to  be  on  the  AML.  Reference AFPAM 63-128 for more information. 4.20.  Missile  Defense  Agency  Related  Acquisition.  Life  cycle  management  support  is provided to the Director, Missile Defense Agency, as needed, to carry out the responsibilities and functions assigned to the Missile Defense Agency IAW DoDD 5134.09, Missile Defense Agency.  Where  the  AF  and  the  Missile  Defense  Agency  have  agreed  through  a  weapon-specific memorandum  of  understanding  that  the  AF  is  responsible  for  the  life  cycle  management  of  an element of the ballistic missile defense system IAW the Deputy Secretary of Defense guidance on Ballistic Missile Defense System funding responsibility, the AF then follows the DoD 5000-series publications and this instruction. 4.21.  Nuclear  Weapon  Related  Policy.  AF  Nuclear  Weapon  related  acquisitions  shall  be developed IAW DoDD 5000.01 and DoDI 5000.02.  AF nuclear certification on nuclear weapon systems shall be considered as early as possible in the acquisition process to ensure compliance with the four DoD nuclear surety standards per DODD 3150.02, DOD Nuclear Weapons Surety Program. 4.21.1.  Nuclear  Certification.    The  PM  ensures  nuclear  weapon  systems  obtain  nuclear certification according to AFI 63-125, Nuclear Certification Program.  For new systems, the PM will engage the nuclear certification process during the requirements analysis process to ensure nuclear surety requirements are factored into the design as early as possible. 4.21.2.  Joint AF-National Nuclear Security Administration developed nuclear weapons will also  be  accomplished  IAW  DoDD  3150.01,  Joint  DOD-Department  of  Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration (DOD-DOD/NNSA) Nuclear Weapon Life Cycle Activities, DoDI  3150.09,  The  Chemical,  Biological,  Radiological,  and  Nuclear  (CBRN)  Survivability Policy,  DoDI  5030.55,  DoD  Procedures  For  Joint  DoD-DOE  Nuclear  Weapons  Life  Cycle  AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 53 Activities,  and  AFI  63-103,  Joint  Air  Force-National  Nuclear  Security  Administration  (AF-NNSA) Nuclear Weapons Life Cycle Management. 4.21.3.  Additional AF nuclear weapon related policy may be found in AFI 16-601, AFI 20-110,  Nuclear  Weapons-Related  Materiel  Management,  AFI  21-204,  Nuclear  Weapons Maintenance  Procedures,  AFI  63-104,  The  SEEK  EAGLE  Program,  AFI  63-125,  AFI  91-101,  Air  Force  Nuclear  Weapons  Surety  Program,  AFI  99-103,  the  Memorandum  of Understanding Between the National Nuclear Security Administration and the Department of the  Air  Force  Regarding  Joint  Testing  and  Assessment  of  the  Nuclear  Weapons  Stockpile, and  MIL-STD-1822,  Nuclear  Compatibility  Certification  of  Nuclear  Weapon  Systems, Subsystems, and Support Equipment. 4.21.4.  Nuclear  Weapon  Related  Materiel  (NWRM).    The  PM  ensures  parts  are  evaluated against NWRM criteria in AFI 20-110.  If assets are deemed NWRM, the PM will implement applicable actions in compliance with AFI 20-110. 4.22.  Management of AF Training Systems.  Refer to AFI 36-2251, Management of Air Force Training Systems, for specific requirements and responsibilities associated with the life cycle of training systems, including aircrew mission training systems, maintenance training systems, and training  services  attendant  to  AF  systems.    Lead  Commands  may  request  PM  participation  in Training Planning Teams activities including accomplishing the Training System Requirements Analysis  and  the  development  of  System  Training  Plans.    Training  systems  that  have  been designated as stand-alone ACAT programs are governed IAW this instruction. 4.22.1.  The PM coordinates the program plans and activities with the Training System PG, lead  commands,  and  HQ  Air  Education  and  Training  Command  (AETC)  to  meet  training system life cycle cost, schedule, and performance requirements. 4.22.2.  The  PM  includes  system  training  concepts  and  training  system  requirements  in  all ASs  prepared  for,  and  subsequent  to,  MS  B.    The  PM  includes  training  system  PMs,  Lead and  Using  Commands,  and  HQ  AETC  during  the  development  of  system  acquisition strategies,  program  plans,  and  pertinent  contract  documents  such  as  System  Requirements Documents. 4.22.3.  The  PM  ensures  training  systems  remain  current  with  prime  mission  systems throughout  the  life  cycle  of  a  system  IAW  approved  program  documentation  and  funding.  The  PM  ensures  that  all  post-production  system  modification  and  upgrade  programs conducted  for  prime  mission  systems  also  include  modifications  to  the  affected  training systems. 4.22.4.  Lead  Command  and  the  PM  determines  the  training  system  fielding  requirements necessary  to  support  the  fielding  of  prime  systems  and  equipment,  to  include  any  FMS considerations.    The  PM  coordinates  training  system  product  acceptance,  movement,  and delivery matters with the Lead Commands that will receive the training system(s). 4.22.5.  The PM assists Lead Commands with management and reporting of training system concurrency matters. 4.22.6.  The  PM  manages,  reports,  and  executes  the  accountability  and  disposal  of  training devices  IAW  federal  acquisition  regulation  and  supplements,  AFI  21-103,  Equipment Inventory Status and Utilization Reporting, and AFI 23-101, as applicable.  54 AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 4.23.  End  Use  Certificates  (EUC).  The  AF  purchases  foreign  products  to  best  meet  US requirements,  consistent  with  US  laws,  regulations,  and  acquisition  policy.    Acquisitions  of foreign products that meet DoD requirements also promote interoperability, standardization, and an expanded procurement base.  Execute EUCs when the purchase of such products is in the best interest of the US and a EUC is required by the foreign government for the purchase of foreign products.  See DoDD 2040.3, End Use Certificates (EUC), for more details. 4.23.1.  US  worldwide  security  responsibilities  are  extensive;  recognition  of  these  special circumstances require flexibility in international agreements in the authorized uses or transfer of  purchased  or  co-developed  articles  and  data.    In  various  circumstances,  international agreements  have  recognized  US  “Use  for  Defense  Purposes”  of  an  item  or  data.    AF personnel  should  seek  to  maintain  “Use  for  Defense  Purposes”  flexibility  in  EUCs  that foreign governments require DoD to sign. 4.23.2.  EUCs are divided into three categories: 4.23.2.1.  Category  I.    Applies  to  acquisition  items  classified  for  security  purposes  by  a foreign government and covered by the nonproliferation agreements to which the US is a party  (such  as  missile  technology).    This  permits  the  item  to  be  used  by  or  for  the  US Government  in  any  part  of  the  world  and  transfer  by  means  of  grant  aid,  International Military  Education  and  Training  (IMET)  programs,  FMS,  and  other  security  assistance and armaments cooperation authorities. 4.23.2.2.  Category II.  Applies to all other items not defined as either Category I or III. 4.23.2.3.  Category  III.  Limits the right to use an item by or for the US  Government in any  part  of  the  world;  or  to  provide  the  item  to  allies  engaged  together  with  the  US  in armed conflict with a common enemy. 4.23.3.  EUCs are a two part process consisting of approval of the EUC and signature of the EUC.    EUCs  are  approved  prior  to  contract  award.    Include  requests  to  delegate  signature authority as part of the approval package.  Approval and signature authorities for EUCs are as follows: 4.23.3.1.  Category I and II.  The SECAF, or a delegated civilian officer, appointed by the President  with  the  advice  and  consent  of  the  Senate,  is  the  approval  authority  for Category  I  and  II  EUCs.    This  approval  authority  may  not  be  further  re-delegated.  Following approval, signature authority can be delegated to PEO. 4.23.3.2.  Category III.  The SECAF or the SECAF representative must request authority from  the  USD(AT&L)  to  purchase  an  item  with  a  Category  III  EUC.    Following approval, signature authority can be delegated to PEO. 4.23.4.  The PM maintains records of all EUCs and provide copies to USD(AT&L). 4.23.4.1.  The PM should ensure compliance, for the life of the purchased item, with the transfer of use restrictions agreed to in signing an EUC. 4.23.4.2.  The PM notifies MAJCOM headquarters of the EUC approval and explains any restrictions  on  the  use,  transfer,  or  disposal  of  the  item’s  hardware,  technology,  and associated technical data.  AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 55 4.24.  Serialized  Item  Management  (SIM).  The  purpose  of  SIM  is  to  improve  the  AF’s capability  to  manage  materiel  through  the  generation,  collection,  and  analysis  of  data  on individual assets in order to enhance asset visibility and financial accountability and to improve system  life  cycle  management.    SIM  is  enabled  through  IUID,  automatic  identification technology  (AIT),  and  automated  information  systems  (AIS).    IUID  is  the  assignment  and marking  of  individual  assets  with  a  standardized,  machine-readable,  two-dimensional  marking containing  a  globally  unique  and  unambiguous  item  identifier.    AIT  is  the  technology  used  to scan the marking at points within the supply chain to identify discrete transactions of an asset as well as transmit the data collected from these transactions to AIS.  AIS store and process the data so  it  can  be  used  to  make  informed  decisions  concerning  the  management  of  the  asset  or  the system.    Reference  DoDI  8320.03,  Unique  Identification  (UID)  Standards  for  a  Net-Centric Department  of  Defense,  DoDI  8320.04,  Item  Unique  Identification  (IUID)  Standards  for Tangible  Personal  Property,  the  DoD  Guide  to  Uniquely  Identifying  Items,  and  DoDI  4151.19 for additional guidance. 4.24.1.  The PM shall document the SIM strategy in the AS and ISP. 4.24.2.  The  PM  shall  identify  in  the  ISP  any  system  operational  needs  for  data  to  conduct SIM in order for Unique Item Identifiers (UIIs) to be used as the key field to associate data on tangible personal property assets. 4.25.  Item Unique Identification (IUID) Planning.  The PM, with support from the PSM and in  collaboration  with  the  AFMC  AIT  program  office,  plans  for  and  implements  IUID.    IUID requirements  are  integrated  into  planning  for  development  of  engineering,  manufacturing, maintenance  technical  data;  configuration  management;  and  integrated  product  support  as prescribed in DFARS 211.274-2, DoDI 5000.02, and DoDI 8320.04, Item Unique Identification (IUID) Standards for Tangible Personal Property.  For more information and non-directive best practices refer to AFPAM 63-128. 4.25.1.  The IUID Implementation Plan is approved by the PEO for ACAT I and II programs.  For ACAT III programs, the MDA is the approval authority. 4.25.2.  The PM begins  IUID implementation planning after the program  has been formally established.    The  PM  includes  the  approved  IUID  Implementation  Plan  in  the  Systems Engineering Plan (SEP). 4.25.3.  The PM, with support from the PSM, documents the part number and serial-number IUID discriminators to support trending analysis. 4.25.4.  For sustainment activities of legacy programs, new individual IUID Implementation Plans are not required.  However, Sustainment Work Center/Cost Center supervisors will still incorporate  planning,  programming,  budgeting,  and  execution  of  IUID  requirements  for legacy  programs  into  day-to-day  workload  planning  and  scheduling  based  on  planned workflows, technical documentation and specifications. This includes registration in the DoD IUID registry. 4.25.5.  Special Interest IUID requirements: 4.25.5.1.  Nuclear Weapons-Related Materiel (NWRM).  All individual NWRM items are accounted for and managed by serial number.  This includes the assignment of a Unique Item  Identifier.  Consistent  with  engineering  analysis,  individual  NWRM  items  in  the  56 AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 DoD  Supply  System  are  marked  with  a  machine  readable  Unique  Item  Identifier  or assigned a virtual Unique Item Identifier. 4.25.5.2.  AF  Automated  Computer  Program  Identification  Number  System  (ACPINS).  When developing new Computer Software Configuration Items (CSCIs) for AF Weapons Systems  and  Automatic  Test  Equipment,  the  ACPINS  will  be  used  in  numbering  each CSCI and related documentation and in ordering and tracking software (reference TO 00-5-16, Technical Manual Methods and Procedures – Software Managers and User Manual for the USAF ACPINS). 4.25.5.3.  Tooling.    The  PM  will  ensure  MDAP  Unique  tooling  associated  with  the production  of  hardware  for  an  MDAP  is  stored  and  preserved  through  the  end  of  the service life of the related system per 48 CFR § 207.106.  Unique tooling designated for preservation  is  considered  DoD  serially  managed  and  should  meet  the  requirements  of IUID as outlined in DoDI 8320.04. 4.25.6.  The  PM  shall  ensure  information  on  marked  items  is  included  in  the  DoD  IUID Registry. 4.25.7.  Program  planning  for  AIT  infrastructure  requirements  and/or  AIS  enhancements  to include  IUID  should  occur  only  if  the  program  is  responsible  for  the  management  and/or maintenance of AIT and/or AIS. 4.26.  Government  Furnished Property (GFP).  The PM identifies, and is accountable for, all required GFP addressed in the SEP and other program documentation.  The PM working with the IPT,  will  identify,  justify,  and  document  the  requirement  for  GFP.    The  PM,  working  with  the PCO,  ensures  the  clauses  at  DFARS  252.211-7007  and  PGI  245.107  are  included  in  all  new contracts  involving  assets for which the  government  has Title (owned by  the AF)  and is  in  the possession of contractors.  The overarching guidance for GFP management is contained in FAR Part 45 and DoDI 8320.04.  The PM ensures the contract specifies the requirements for property accountability in the Accountable Property System of Record as described in DoDI 5000.64. 4.26.1.  The PM will ensure the list of GFP is provided to the contracting office, and listed as an  attachment  to  the  official  contract,  in  the  GFP  Attachment  formats,  IAW  DFARS 245.103-72 and PGI 245.103-72, Government-furnished property attachments to solicitations and awards. 4.26.2.  The PM, working with the program office, shall conduct a physical inventory of all GFP, to include data in the contract, the AF Equipment Management System, and the IUID Registry  annually.  The  PM  maintains  property  accountability  and  conducts  a  physical inventory of all GFP, to include data in the contract, the AF Equipment Management System, and  the  IUID  Registry  annually,  IAW  the  procedures  of  DoDI  5000.64,  DoDI  4140.01 (equipment), and DLM 4000.25 (material). 4.27.  Industrial  Base  Constraints.  All  programs  identify  and  manage  industrial  base constraints  throughout  all  phases  of  the  life  cycle,  from  requirements  definition  to  disposal.  Industrial  base  constraints  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  critical  raw  materials,  sources  of strategic materials, counterfeit parts, DMSMS, manufacturing technologies and capabilities, the supply  chain,  parts  obsolescence,  depot  capacity,  and  industrial  workforce.    Implementing Commands can assist the PM in addressing DMSMS, industrial base constraints, and industrial base assessments (IBA).  AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 57 4.27.1.  The  PM  addresses  industrial  base  constraints  in  the  AS  and  LCSP.    This  should address  mitigation  to  ensure  that  the  system(s)  can  be  supported,  upgraded,  and  updated during  its  life  cycle.    Open  systems  design  can  help  manage  the  risks  associated  with technology  obsolescence  and  diminishing  manufacturing  capabilities  by  avoiding  being locked into proprietary technology or by relying on a single source over the life of a system.  Incremental  development  also  should  be  considered  to  alleviate  obsolescence  concerns.  Reference the DoD Open Systems Architecture Contract Guidebook for Program Managers. 4.27.2.  The  PM  ensures  that  product  support  efforts  include  an  active  DMSMS  process  to anticipate occurrences and take appropriate actions.  For further information on DMSMS or Government Industry Data Exchange Program (GIDEP), reference the DMSMS Knowledge Sharing Portal for the SD-22, DMSMS Guidebook, and DoDM 4140.01. 4.27.3.  The  PM  follows  the  procedures  of  DoDI  5000.60,  Defense  Industrial  Base Assessments,  when  proposing  the  use  of  government  funds  for  the  preservation  of  an industrial capability. 4.27.4.  All  ACAT  programs  shall  complete  an  IBA  as  prescribed  by  DoDI  5000.60.    The IBA will be conducted as part of technology development prior to MS B, and prior to MS C.  Results of the IBA will inform the AS and support the Development RFP.  In addition, a PM for  MDAPs  shall  engage  the  Office  of  the  Deputy  Assistant  Secretary  of  Defense  for Manufacturing and Industrial Base Policy at the beginning of the IBA development process. 4.28.  Small Business (SB) ILCM Activities.  The PM ensures that SB is an integral part of the life cycle from DP through system demilitarization and disposal to help meet SB goals set by the PEO.    Early  considerations  to  provide  maximum  practicable  opportunities  for  SB  include  pre-acquisition  market  research  and  requirements  definition  categorization  planning,  principally  in support  of  MDD  and  AoA,  to  ensure  approval  authorities  are  offered  trade  space  for  portfolio and  risk  management.    See  AFI  64-201,  Air  Force  Small  Business  Programs,  for  more information. 4.29.  Other  Acquisition  Planning  Requirements.  The  PM  considers  the  requirements  in Table  4.2  as  part  of  acquisition  planning.    These  planning  requirements  do  not  apply  to  all programs and are applied when required for the program. Table 4.2.  Other Acquisition Planning Requirements.

Systems  engineering  provides  the  integrating technical  processes  and  design leadership to  define and balance system  performance, life cycle cost, schedule, risk, and system security within and across individual systems and programs.  The CE,  in  support  of  the  PM,  embeds  systems  engineering  in  program  planning  and  execution  to support  the  entire  system  life  cycle.    It  requires  optimization  at  the  system  level,  using  SE processes (section 5.2.) throughout the lifecycle (section 5.3.) to integrate user capability needs with design considerations (section 5.4.) to affordably satisfy customer needs. 5.1.1.  Life  Cycle  Systems  Engineering  (LCSE).    The  CE,  in  support  of  the  PM,  is responsible  for  assuring  the  proper  application  of  engineering  principles,  processes,  and practices across the life cycle of a system to ensure that it is satisfying the user's capability needs  as  defined  by  the  system's  Lead  and  Using  Commands.    Configuration  management and  control,  deficiency  reporting  and  response,  reliability,  maintainability,  integrity,  HSI implementation,  ESOH  risk  management,  mishap  investigation,  and  other  engineering practices combine to successfully develop, test, build, field, operate, sustain, and dispose of systems.    The  PM  includes  representatives  of  the  operational,  maintenance/sustainment, safety, and test and evaluation communities in these efforts.  In addition, the PM establishes and  documents  relationships  and  responsibilities  with  other  organizations  that  support  or interface  with  systems  or  end  items  managed  by  the  PM.    The  PM  monitors  the  fielded system  by  tracking  and  evaluating  system  data  to  ensure  the  preservation  of  the  technical baseline.  The PM conducts periodic in-service reviews with the Lead and Using Commands using leading  and trailing indicator data elements selected in  concert with the users to  help ensure effective communication of issues, concerns, and priorities.  The PM documents how these LCSE requirements are being met in the PMA, SEP, and LCSP avoiding duplication. 5.1.2.  Systems  Engineering  Plan  (SEP).    The  PM’s  fundamental  technical  planning document is  the SEP.  It defines methods for implementing all system requirements having technical content, technical staffing, and technical management. 5.1.2.1.  This  AFI  delegates  AF  SEP  approval  authority  from  the  SAE  to  the  PEO  for ACAT  I  programs  and  final  SEP  approval  authority  for  ACAT  II  programs.    Per  DoDI 5000.02,  DASD(SE)  reviews  the  SEP  for  MDAP  and  MAIS  programs  prior  to  final approval.  The MDA is the final SEP approval authority, regardless of ACAT.  PEOs for ACAT  I,  IA,  and  non-delegated  ACAT  II  programs  coordinates  SEPs  with  SAF/AQR prior to approval.  The PM and PEO approve the draft SEP prepared for the Development RFP Release Decision Point.  The final version of this draft SEP is approved by the MDA at MS B. 5.1.2.2.  The CE, in support of the PM, prepares a SEP for formal approval as required by DoDI  5000.02.    The  PM  complies  with  standard  content  and  format  of  the  DoD  SEP Outline.    SEPs  should  reference  organization  or  portfolio  standard  engineering  process documents,  if  appropriate.    Deviations  from  these  referenced  standard  engineering processes should be documented in the SEP.  62 AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 5.1.2.3.  Post-MS  C,  the  PEO  establishes  a  review  and  approval  schedule  for  each program  office  in  the  PEO’s  portfolio.    The  PM  and  CE  review  the  SEP  (and  attached documents) for currency and consistency with other program documentation and update and approve it per the PEO’s schedule.  The SEP should be a “living” “go to” technical planning  document  and  the  blueprint  for  the  conduct,  management,  and  control  of  the technical aspects of the government’s program from concept to disposal. 5.1.2.4.  The PM ensures that the  contractor systems  engineering approach is  aligned to the program’s SEP. 5.1.3.  Mission Assurance (MA) for Space Programs.  The PM ensures that MA is an integral part  of  the  space  system  development,  and  is  integrated  throughout  life  cycle  and documented  in  life  cycle  documentation.    MA  is  defined  as  the  disciplined  application  of proven scientific, engineering, quality, and program management principles towards the goal of  achieving  mission  success.    MA  follows  a  general  SE  framework  and  uses  RM  and independent assessment as cornerstones throughout the program life cycle.  Refer to AFI 10-1211, Space Launch Operations, for more information.  MA does not replace the mandatory elements  of  the  system  safety  process  described  in  MIL-STD-882E  unless  waived  by  the MDA. 5.1.4.  Certifications.    Certifications  provide  a  formal  acknowledgement  by  a  mandatory approval authority that a system or program meets specific requirements.  The PM ensures all required  certifications  are  obtained  prior  to  testing  and  operational  use,  and  maintained  for the life of the system. 5.1.4.1.  The PM includes in the SEP applicable certifications for the program and when they are required.  The PM also includes certification activities and events in the IMS. 5.1.4.2.  DoDI  5000.02  provides  a  list  of  statutory  and  regulatory  requirements  and   AFPAM  63-128,  Attachment  14,  Acquisition  Program  Technical certifications. Certifications Summary provides a list of potential certifications for the PM to review for applicability. 5.1.4.3.  A  PM  for  aircraft  systems  (manned  and  unmanned)  shall  obtain  required airworthiness approvals IAW AFI 62-601, USAF Airworthiness. 5.1.4.4.  A PM for nuclear weapon systems shall obtain required nuclear certification in accordance with AFI 63-125. 5.1.5.  SE  Role  in  Contracts.    The  PM  includes  SE  requirements  in  program  contracting efforts  to  ensure  offerors  provide  sufficient  SE  resources.    The  primary  tool  for  shaping  a program contract is the RFP. 5.1.5.1.  The  CE  participates  in  the  RFP  development  team  and  is  responsible  for  all technical aspects of the RFP.  The CE, at a minimum, ensures that the RFP: 5.1.5.1.1.  References required operational documentation and specifications; 5.1.5.1.2.  Identifies appropriate design requirements; 5.1.5.1.3.  Identifies  government-required  technical  data  to  be  produced  by  the contractor; 5.1.5.1.4.  Specifies testing and verification requirements;  AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 63 5.1.5.1.5.  Specifies certification requirements; 5.1.5.1.6.  Specifies all technical review and technical documentation requirements; 5.1.5.1.7.  Specifies system cybersecurity requirements. 5.1.5.2.  The  DoD  Guide  for  Integrating  Systems  Engineering  into  Contracts  provides additional guidance on SE role in contracts. 5.1.5.3.  IEEE-15288, Systems and Software Engineering – System Life Cycle Processes, IEEE  15288.1,  Application  of  Systems  Engineering  on  Defense  Programs,  and  IEEE-15288.2,  Standard  for  Technical  Reviews  and  Audits  on  Defense  Programs,  provide industry-accepted  requirements  for implementing  systems  engineering  for  DoD programs. 5.1.6.  System of Systems (SoS) and Family of Systems (FoS) Engineering.  SE for SoS/FoS emphasizes interoperability  among  systems  developed  under  different  sponsorship, management,  and  primary  acquisition  processes,  and  often  operated  by  other  Services, Agencies, allies, and coalition partners. 5.1.6.1.  The PM and CE analyze the program’s system operations concept and capability document to identify external dependencies, interoperability, and cybersecurity needs and ensure  that  they  are  integrated  into  the  program’s  requirements  decomposition,  risk management,  interface  management,  architecture,  verification,  validation,  and  other processes. 5.1.6.2.  M&S (to include Model  Based Systems  Engineering) is an  effective means  for understanding  complex  SoS/FoS,  and  can  provide  insights  into  interoperability  in  the SoS/FoS mission context. 5.1.6.3.  The PM identifies interdependent  systems that may be impacted  by a proposed baseline change, and during the design process, coordinates the change with the PM (or equivalents) of the affected systems. 5.1.7.  Air  Force  Technical  Authority.  SAF/AQR  is  the  Air  Force  Chief  Engineer  and Technical  Authority  per  HAF  MD  1-10.  The  Air  Force  Chief  Engineer  and  Technical Authority  provides  the  SAE  unbiased  technical  advice  for  pre-acquisition  investment decisions  and  throughout  the  acquisition  life  cycle;  engages  Implementing  Commands  and Center-level engineering offices to provide technical support to PEOs and PMs; oversees AF Engineering  Enterprise  policy  and  guidance;  and  directs  external  technical  assessments  of programs, as needed. 5.1.7.1.  SAF/AQR  may  delegate  attendance  at  any  of  the  four  primary  program  office technical  reviews  (Alternative  Systems  Review,  Preliminary  Design  Review  [PDR], Critical  Design  Review  [CDR],  and  Production  Readiness  Review  [PRR]) to Implementing Commands and Center-level Engineering offices and request the attendees provide results and recommendations to SAF/AQR, with courtesy copies to the PM and PEO, using a SAF/AQR prescribed reporting template. 5.1.7.2.  Prior  to  SAF/AQ-chaired  reviews  of  a  program,  representatives  of  the  PEO  or PM for the program and the Center-level engineering office  supporting the program each provide SAF/AQR with their separate assessments of the program's technical status.  64 AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 5.2.  Systems  Engineering  Processes.  Application  of  SE  processes  enables  sound  decision-making  which  increases  capability  maturity  and  reduces  risk.    The  CE  ensures  systems engineering processes are integrated.  The CE, in support of the PM, documents the tailoring of systems engineering processes in the SEP. 5.2.1.  Technical Management Processes. 5.2.1.1.  Technical  Planning.   Technical  planning  identifies  processes,  schedules, personnel/skills,  facilities,  and  other  internal  and  external  resources  necessary  for  the technical effort. 5.2.1.2.  Decision Analysis.   Decision analysis helps  the PM and the CE understand the impact  that  uncertainty  has  on  decision-making,  and  identifies  and  communicates  a course  of  action  that  best  balances  competing  objectives.    The  CE  identifies,  organizes, and executes necessary trade studies to support program technical decisions and presents the resulting recommendations to the PM. 5.2.1.3.  Technical  Assessment.    Technical  assessment  consists  of  formal  technical reviews  established  by  DoDI  5000.02,  internal  assessments  of  program  technical performance  against  program  established  technical  performance  measures,  and  external assessments and audits.  Formal technical reviews assess design progress, technical risk, and  program  maturity  at  key  points  in  life  cycle,  and  determine  whether  to  proceed  to next  level  of  development.    The  principal  formal  technical  reviews  are  the  Alternative Systems Review, System Requirements Review, System Functional Review, PDR, CDR, System  Verification  Review,  Functional  Configuration  Audit,  PRR,  and  Physical Configuration Audit.  Only the PDR and CDR are mandatory. 5.2.1.3.1.  The  PM  and  CE  co-chair  principal  formal  technical  reviews.    The  PM ensures that principal formal technical reviews are event-driven and that entrance and exit criteria are established ahead of time as identified in the SEP. 5.2.1.3.2.  For  MDAP  and  MAIS  programs,  the  PM  invites  SAF/AQR  and  Center ENs  to  attend  principal  formal  technical  reviews  and  invites  cognizant  DASD(SE) staff  members  to  the  CDR.    The  PM  also  provides  access  to  the  technical  data relevant to the issues, risks and topics to be addressed at a given technical review. 5.2.1.3.3.  Technology  Readiness  Assessments  (TRA).    TRA  is  the  primary  tool  to benchmark  and  begin  to  assess  maturity  of  critical  technologies.    TRAs  are mandatory for MDAPs at Development RFP Release Decision Point with updates for MS B to inform the 2366b certification per DoDI 5000.02.  TRAs are not required for MAIS  programs,  non-MDAPs  or  MDAP  MS  C  decisions,  except  for  MDAPs entering the acquisition process at MS C.  MDAs for non-ACAT I programs should require  the  CE,  in  support  of  the  PM,  to  perform  a  TRA  for  a  program  with  high technological risk.  If a program requires a TRA, the PM obtains SAF/AQR approval on behalf of SAF/AQ for each of the following:  TRA Plan, final critical  technology list,  Draft  (also  known  as  ‘Preliminary’)  TRA  Report,  and  Final  TRA  Report.  Reference  USD(AT&L)  Memo,  Improving  Technology  Readiness  Assessment Effectiveness,  11  May  2011,  and  DoD  Technology  Readiness  Assessment  (TRA) Guidance.  AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 65 5.2.1.3.4.  TRAs  do  not  provide  a  comprehensive  assessment  of  the  degree  of  risk mitigation  needed  prior  to  development.    Deeper  analysis  of  the  actual  risks associated  with  the  preferred  design  and  any  recommended  risk  mitigation  must  be conducted IAW Chapter 4. 5.2.1.3.5.  IEEE-15288.2,  Standard  for  Technical  Reviews  and  Audits  on  Defense Programs,  provides  industry-accepted  requirements  for  technical  reviews  and  audits of DoD programs 5.2.1.4.  Requirements  Management.    The  PM  implements  a  consistent  and  rigorous process for development, establishment, and control of technical requirements.  The PM ensures  that  all  requirements  in  the  system  specification  are  traceable  to  stated  user capability needs. 5.2.1.4.1.  The  PM  ensures  that  program  and  system  requirements  include  all documented user requirements, airworthiness requirements, statutory, regulatory, and certification  requirements;  and  ensures  bi-directional  requirements  traceability  from the systems level down through all verification and validation activities. 5.2.1.5.  Risk  Management.    The  CE,  in  support  of  the  PM,  ensures  that  technical  risks are  incorporated  into  the  program’s  overall  risk  management  effort  as  described  in Chapter 4. 5.2.1.6.  Configuration  Management  (CM).    Configuration  Management  is  formalized change  management  of  the  system  Technical  Baseline,  which  includes  a  Functional Baseline, an Allocated Baseline, and a Product Baseline. The CE, in support of the PM, uses  CM  to  establish  and  control  product  attributes  and  technical  baselines  across  the system  life  cycle.    EIA-649-1,  Configuration  Management  Requirements  for  Defense Contractors,  provides  industry-accepted  requirements  for  implementing  configuration management on DoD programs.  MIL-HDBK-61, Configuration Management Guidance, contains detailed information about CM. 5.2.1.6.1.  The  Functional  Baseline  (also  referred  to  as  the  Requirements  Baseline) consists  of  the  documented,  validated,  and  approved  system-level  (top  level) functional  and  performance  requirements  and  design  constraints,  their  allocation  or assignment to the next level, and all approved changes.  Typically, it is at the System Functional Review where this baseline is first approved. 5.2.1.6.2.  The  Allocated  Baseline  consists  of  the  documented,  validated,  and approved  "design-to"  requirements,  and  all  changes  thereto  approved  IAW  the contract.  The allocated baseline includes (a) the physical hierarchy, (b) the design-to requirements  for  each  product  in  the  hierarchy,  and  (c)  separable  documentation identifying all design-to requirements for each component and integrated grouping of components. 5.2.1.6.3.  The  Product  Baseline  is  the  "build-to"  requirements  for  each  physical element  to  be  manufactured;  the  software  code  for  each  software  element  that  has been  separately  designed  or  tested;  and  the  "buy-to"  requirements  for  any  other physical element, part, or material to be procured.  66 AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 5.2.1.6.4.  The PM ensures key CM practices and responsibilities are summarized in the SEP IAW the DoD SEP Outline. 5.2.1.7.  Data  Management  (DM).    DM  identifies,  acquires,  manages,  maintains,  and provides  access  to  the  technical  data  and  computer  software  required  to  manage  and support  a  system  throughout  its  life  cycle.    See  Chapter  4  for  IMD  management  and LMDP guidance and Chapter 7 for other data management guidance. 5.2.1.8.  Interface  Management  (IM).    The  IM  process  ensures  interface  definition  and compliance  among  the  internal  elements  that  comprise  a  system,  as  well  as  with  other systems.    The  PM  and  the  CE  ensure  that  internal  and  external  interface  requirement changes are documented IAW the program’s CM plan. 5.2.2.  Technical Processes. 5.2.2.1.  Stakeholder  Requirements  Definition.    The  PM  and  CE  work  with  the  user  to establish,  assess  and  refine  operational  needs,  attributes,  performance  parameters,  and constraints that flow from and influence user described capabilities. 5.2.2.2.  Requirements Analysis.  The PM ensures that all relevant program requirements and design considerations (see section 5.4.) are addressed in program specifications and baselines.    If  the  PM  generates  program-unique  specifications,  they  should  be  prepared IAW MIL-STD-961,  Defense and Program-Unique Specifications Format and Content, and informed by its companion document SD-15, Guide to Performance Specifications. 5.2.2.3.  Architecture Design.  The PM ensures that architectural descriptions conform to the  requirements  of  the  DoD  Architecture  Framework  (DoDAF).    For  IT  and  NSS,  the PM works with the applicable sponsor to ensure architectures are developed IAW CJCSI 5123.01G, DoDI 8330.01 and AFI 17-140.  For IT and NSS, the PM also ensures that the architectures  are  aligned  with  the  AF  Enterprise  Architecture  and  DoD  Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA) when applicable. 5.2.2.3.1.  The  PM  and  CE  ensure  that  architecture  products  include  the  program’s system as well as its potential interfaces and/or impacts to external systems (i.e., the FoS/SoS environment).  The PM develops  architecture products  as early  as possible and maintains them throughout the life cycle. 5.2.2.3.2.  The PM applies MOSA and Open Technology Development to the system architecture design wherever feasible. 5.2.2.3.3.  The  PM  conducts  architecture-based  assessments  of  trades  in  the  overall operational  context.    The  PM  and  CE  ensure  that  each  principal  formal  technical review  includes  an  architecture-based  assessment  to  confirm  that  the  system development remains aligned to the operational requirements. 5.2.2.3.4.  All architectures are approved IAW AFI 17-140, including any architecture that goes to Air Force requirements process validation staffing or JROC. 5.2.2.4.  Implementation.    Implementation  provides  the  system  design  and  creates  the lowest  level  subsystems  in  the  system  hierarchy  by  increasing  subsystem  maturity, reducing  subsystem  risk,  and  ensuring  the  subsystems  are  ready  for  integration, verification, and validation.  AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 67 5.2.2.5.  Integration.    Integration  systematically  assembles  lower  level  system  elements into successively higher-level assemblies with verification at each step. 5.2.2.6.  Verification.    Verification  confirms  that  the  program’s  system  satisfies  system specifications.    The  PM  and  the  CDT/TM  manage  verification  activities,  to  include developmental testing.  The PM and the CE review the results of verification throughout the life cycle. 5.2.2.7.  Validation.    Validation  provides  objective  evidence  that  the  system  meets  user capability  needs  and  achieves  its  intended  use  in  its  intended  operational  environment.  OT&E is a core validation process.  Refer to AFI 99-103 for more information on T&E processes.  The PM ensures the system is ready for OT&E.  The PM will implement the dedicated OT review process as described in AFMAN 63-119 and briefs the MDA who will certify system readiness for IOT&E. 5.2.2.8.  Transition.  Transition delivers and sustains a system for the end user. 5.2.2.8.1.  The CE works with the PSM to ensure that the LCSP includes appropriate technical information for sustainment and product support. 5.2.2.8.2.  The  PM  provides  Technical  Orders  (TO)  and  other  maintenance  and supportability technical data to the end user IAW Chapter 7. 5.2.2.8.3.  The  PM  establishes  and  maintains  deficiency  reporting  processes  for operators and maintainers and ensures that all validated deficiency reports are tracked to actual resolution of the deficiency.  The PM works with the CE to document this process  in  the  SEP  no  later  than  MS  C.    Refer  to  TO  00-35D-54,  USAF  Deficiency Reporting, Investigation, and Resolution, for more information. 5.2.2.8.4.  The PM and CE co-chair in-service review(s) to address deficiencies. 5.3.  SE Activities in the Life Cycle. 5.3.1.  Early  SE.    Early  SE  encompasses  pre-acquisition  technical  planning,  principally  in support of MDD and AoA, to ensure leadership is offered trade space for portfolio and risk management.    The  results  of  early  SE  and  DP  activities  are  documented  in  the  Concept Characterization  and  Technical  Description  (CCTD)  and  are  the  principal  artifacts  of  Early SE.    The  AF  Early  SE  Guide  and  the  AF  CCTD  Guide  provide  additional  information.  SAF/AQR  reviews  the  CCTD  and  provides  technical  recommendations  to  the  decision authority.    Provide  CCTDs  prepared  for  requirements  validation  and  approval  preceding MDD to SAF/AQR 90 days prior to the decision. 5.3.2.  SE  during  System  Development.    During  system  development,  CE  uses  the  SE processes (section 5.2.) to integrate user capability needs with design considerations (section 5.4.) to affordably satisfy customer needs. 5.3.3.  Sustainment SE.  Beginning at Initial Operational Capability (IOC), sustainment SE is focused  on  maintaining  the  technical  baseline  of  the  system.    Key  Sustainment  SE considerations include but are not limited to the following: 5.3.3.1.  Configuration Management (see 5.2.1.6.) 5.3.3.2.  Deficiency Reporting (see 5.2.2.8.3.)  68 AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 5.3.3.3.  DMSMS (see 5.4.8.) 5.3.3.4.  Reliability and Maintainability (see 5.4.20.) 5.3.3.5.  Manufacturing and Quality Management during O&S. 5.3.3.6.  Refer to AFI 63-145, Manufacturing and Quality Management. 5.3.3.7.  Additive  Manufacturing.  Use  of  Additive  Manufacturing  to  build  replacement parts for a system under a PM’s configuration control must have prior PM approval. 5.3.3.8.  Engineering  and  Technical  Support  (ETS) to  Field-level  Maintenance Organizations. PMs provide ETS throughout the life cycle,  beginning with IOT&E.  To provide ETS, PMs use organic or contractor resources or a combination of the two.  PMs address the ETS strategy in the MS C SEP. 5.3.4.  SE in Support of Demilitarization and Disposal.  See Chapter 7. 5.4.  Systems  Engineering  Design  Considerations.  The  CE  uses  SE  processes  across  the  life cycle to accomplish trade-offs to provide balanced solutions, optimized at the system-level, that affordably satisfy desired user capabilities. 5.4.1.  AF-Unique Design Considerations. 5.4.1.1.  Recorded Aircraft  Information (RAI).  For any  air system acquired, developed, or  sustained  by  the  AF,  the  PM  collaborates  with  data  user  stakeholders  to  conduct  a systematic  assessment  of  information  needs  (including  mishap  investigation,  integrity programs,  maintenance  and  operational  analyses)  to  ensure  the  capture  of  critical information  and  optimization  of  benefit  while  minimizing  cost.    This  includes  an assessment of needed interfaces with existing information systems (e.g., REMIS, LIMS-EV).  The PM re-assesses information needs and data collection capabilities as a part of aircraft and system modifications.  The uses of RAI include the following: 5.4.1.1.1.  Aviation Mishap Investigation.  All AF aircraft requiring AF airworthiness approval  shall  record  crash  survivable  parametric  and  acoustic  data  that  meets  the minimum  requirements  listed  in  AFH  63-1402,  Aircraft  Information  Program,  to support mishap investigation. 5.4.1.1.2.  The  PM  ensures  that  aircraft  employ  devices  (i.e.  Emergency  Locator Transmitters  and  Underwater  Locator  Beacons)  to  enable  recovery  of  the  data recording  equipment  in  the  event  of  a  mishap.  Consideration  may  be  given  to inhibiting these devices to address combat operational concerns. 5.4.1.1.3.  The PM provides the Air Force Safety Center the capability (hardware and software)  to  download  and  analyze  crash  survivable  data  for  mishap  investigations, and updates that capability, as needed, throughout the life cycle. 5.4.1.1.4.  For  aircraft  that  do  not  meet  these  requirements,  the  Lead  Command Commander  may  waive  the  requirements.    Parameters  that  are  not  applicable  to  a particular  platform  (e.g.,  a  C-130  afterburner  nozzle  position)  do  not  need  to  be waived. 5.4.1.1.4.1.  The Lead Command’s Director of Safety is responsible for preparing, staffing, and submitting waiver requests to the Commander.  AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 69 5.4.1.1.4.2.  The  PM  provides  the  Lead  Command  with  the  data  on  the  cost, schedule, and performance impacts of meeting these requirements. 5.4.1.1.4.3.  Command Directors of Safety will report approved waivers within 30 days to the Air Force Chief of Safety (AF/SE) and provide the cost, schedule, and technical information that supported the waiver decisions. 5.4.1.1.4.4.  Existing waivers from the AF Vice Chief of Staff remain valid IAW their original terms and conditions. 5.4.1.1.5.  Military  Flight  Operations  Quality  Assurance  (MFOQA).    MFOQA provides  insight  into  the  operational  usage  of  the  aerial  system  through  analysis  of flight  maneuvers  and  identification  of  hazard  trends  and  facilitates  risk  assessment and  handling/mitigation  activities.    See  AFI  91-225,  Aviation  Safety  Programs,  for more information. 5.4.1.1.5.1.  The PM provides integrated system solutions that support customer-defined  MFOQA  capability  needs  for  each  MDS  the  AF  acquires  or  uses (including manned and unmanned). 5.4.1.1.5.2.  The  PM  assists  lead  commands  in  assessing  risks  and  determining handling/mitigation measures when MFOQA data analyses identify new hazards. 5.4.1.1.6.  System  Health  and  Usage  Monitoring.    The  collection  and  monitoring  of service  use  and  performance  data  (including  maintenance  discrepancy  reports,  user feedback, system/component failure reports and mishap data) enables the continuous assessment  of  fielded  system  technical  health  against  documented  performance requirements and effectiveness, suitability, and risk measures. 5.4.1.1.6.1.  The PM integrates system and end-item operational and maintenance data collection, storage, and transmission. 5.4.1.1.6.2.  For  aircraft, integrates  user-defined,  capability-based, enhanced flight data requirements (e.g., CBM+, integrity, training, MFOQA, etc.) with  the  mandatory  crash  survivable  recorder  requirement  when  identifying  an aircraft flight data parameter recording, storage, and transmission capability. the  PM 5.4.1.2.  Product  and  System  Integrity.    For  all  new  or  modified  systems,  the  PM  plans and implements  effective integrity programs.     For each Aircraft Mission Design Series (MDS)  the  AF  acquires,  uses,  or  leases,  the  PM  establishes  an  Aircraft  Structural Integrity Program (ASIP) IAW AFI 63-140, Aircraft Structural Integrity Program. 5.4.1.2.1.  The  PM  integrates  the  development,  documentation,  and  implementation of  other  integrity  efforts  applicable  to  their  systems  by  applying  and  tailoring  the following documents:  MIL-STD-3024, Propulsion System Integrity Program; MIL-STD-1798,  Mechanical  Equipment  and  Subsystem  Integrity  Program;  MIL-STD-1796,  Avionics  Integrity  Program;  MIL-HDBK-513,  Low  Observable  Integrity Program;  MIL-HDBK-515,  Weapon  System  Integrity  Guide  (WSIG);  MIL-HDBK-525, Electrical Wiring Interconnect System (EWIS) Integrity Program; MIL-HDBK-1783, Engine Structural Integrity Program (ENSIP).  70 AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 5.4.1.2.2.  Corrosion  prevention  and  control  (CPC)  (which  is  the  prevention  and control  of  material  degradation)  is  an  important  element  of  product  and  system integrity.  The PM integrates CPC with program integrity efforts. 5.4.1.2.3.  PMs develop, document, execute, and obtain approval for their ASIP IAW MIL-STD-1530, Aircraft Structural Integrity Program (ASIP). 5.4.1.2.4.  In  order  to  preserve  the  integrity  of  the  system,  the  CE  ensures  that  non-destructive  inspection  procedures,  to  include  procedures  for  TCTOs  and  one-time repair  purposes  (e.g.,  Technical  Assistance  Requests),  are  approved  by  a  technician certified to Level III IAW NAS 410, Certification & Qualification of Nondestructive Test Personnel. 5.4.1.3.  AF  Metrology  and  Calibration  (AFMETCAL).    Acquisition  of  systems  and equipment  includes  assessment  of  calibration  and  measurement  requirements  IAW  AFI 21-113, Air Force Metrology and Calibration Management. 5.4.2.  Accessibility.  The PM ensures that all electronic and information technology systems comply  with  Section  508  of  the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act  (36  CFR  §1194),  unless exempt under FAR 39.204 as a military system or NSS. 5.4.3.  Affordability-SE Tradeoff Analysis 5.4.3.1.  At MS A, the PM establishes an affordability goal (see section 3.15).  This goal is the basis for pre-MS B decision-making, SE tradeoff analysis, and the basis for trade-offs between a commodity’s capability and its cost. 5.4.3.2.  At MS B, the PM provides the results of cost analyses that quantitatively depict the  impact  of  trading  cost  against  affordability  drivers,  such  as  capability  and  other technical  parameters  (including  KPPs  when  they  are  major  cost  drivers)  to  show  the program has established a cost-effective design point for these affordability drivers. 5.4.4.  Anti-Counterfeiting.  The PM manages the risk of counterfeit components as a part of Program Protection Planning as described in Chapter 6. 5.4.5.  Commercial-Off-the-Shelf  (COTS).    For  COTS  systems  and  components  being contemplated for use in the program, the PM evaluates the risks of using those items in the intended military use environment.  The PM applies the appropriate SE processes and design considerations to COTS systems and components through the life cycle. 5.4.6.  Corrosion Prevention and Control (CPC).  The AF CPC program is a part of the long-term  DoD  CPC  strategy  that  supports  to  reduce  total  system  ownership  cost.    See  DoDI 5000.67,  Prevention  and  Mitigation  of  Corrosion  on  DoD  Military  Equipment  and Infrastructure,  MIL-STD-1568,  Materials  and  Processes  for  Corrosion  Prevention  and Control in Aerospace Weapons Systems, and DoDI 5000.02 for additional guidance.  Further information, including the DoD Corrosion Prevention and Control Planning Guidebook for Systems and Equipment, can be found at the CorrDefense website. 5.4.6.1.  The  CE,  in  support  of  the  PM,  conducts  and  integrates  CPC  planning  into appropriate program documentation IAW DoDI 5000.67.  The PM may include corrosion planning  documentation  in  a  separate,  Corrosion  Prevention  and  Control  Plan  (CPCP), which is considered a best practice, or the PM includes corrosion planning in the SEP and LCSP.    For  ACAT  I  programs,  the  PM  provides  the  AF  Corrosion  Control  and  AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 71 Prevention  Executive  (CCPE)  the  CPCP, the  SEP,  or  the  LCSP  prior  to  obtaining  PEO approval. 5.4.6.2.  The  PM  evaluates  CPC  as  a  part  of  SE  trades  throughout  program  design  and development activities. 5.4.6.3.  For  new  starts,  the  PM  obtains  early  AF  CCPE  involvement  in  corrosion planning including comparing the CPCP, SEP, and LCSP content to the guidance in the DoD Corrosion Prevention and Control Planning Guidebook for Systems and Equipment for each life cycle phase. 5.4.6.4.  IAW  DFARS  223.73,  Minimizing  the  Use  of  Materials  Containing  Hexavalent Chromium, the PM shall not use hexavalent chromium in new systems unless the use is approved by the PEO, with the AF CCPE’s coordination.  Critical reasons for approving the use of hexavalent chromium include unacceptable corrosion prevention performance or life cycle sustainment impacts of available alternatives.  During system modifications, follow-on  procurements  of  legacy  systems,  or  maintenance  procedure  updates,  the  PM evaluates  the  opportunity  to  cost-effectively  and  safely  replace  hexavalent  chromium without adversely impacting R&M. 5.4.7.  Critical Safety Items (CSI).  Critical Safety Items are parts whose failure could cause loss of life, permanent disability or major injury, loss of a system, or significant equipment damage.    CSI  should  not  be  confused  with  “safety  critical  items”  as  defined  in  MIL-STD-882E.  CSI statutory requirements are contained in Section 802 of Pub. L. 108-136 and are codified in 10 U.S.C. §2319.  AF CSI regulatory requirements are contained in AFI 20-106, Management  of  Aviation  Critical  Safety  Items.    See  also  DFARS  246.407,  Nonconforming Supplies or Services, and DFARS 246.371, Notification of Potential Safety Issues. 5.4.7.1.  The PM identifies CSIs prior to CDR and identifies CSIs on bills of materials. 5.4.7.2.  The  PM  obtains  CSIs  only  from  sources  approved  by  the  Engineering  Support Activity  (ESA).  This  applies only to  CSIs not  under the direct  configuration control of the program. 5.4.7.3.  The  CE,  in  support  of  the  PM,  develops  and  maintains  an  updated  list  of  CSIs and  corresponding  critical  characteristics,  updated  annually  after  Full  Operational Capability  (FOC).    The  PM  should  ensure  a  process  is  in  place  to  track  the  impact  of mishap  investigations,  deficiency  reports,  ECPs  and  other  processes  that  may  affect  the inclusion of items on the list of CSIs, or result in  a change of the critical characteristics for CSIs. 5.4.8.  Diminishing Manufacturing Sources & Material Shortages (DMSMS).  DMSMS is the loss,  or  impending  loss,  of  manufacturers  or  suppliers  of  items,  raw  materials,  or  software.  The  PM  integrates  DMSMS  into  program  risk  management  activities  (see  Chapter  3).  Consult  SD-22,  Diminishing  Manufacturing  Sources  and  Material  Shortages  (DMSMS) Guidebook, for additional information. 5.4.9.  Disposal and Demilitarization.  See Chapter 7. 5.4.10.  ESOH.  The  CE,  in  support  of  the  PM,  identifies,  assesses,  and  mitigates  potential ESOH risks to personnel, the system, and the environment, and manages ESOH compliance requirements.  The CE:  72 AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 5.4.10.1.  Ensures  ESOH  risk  management  is  integrated  into  systems  engineering  using the system safety process described in MIL-STD-882E.  The CE uses the standard matrix in  MIL-STD-882E  unless  the  PM  obtains  formal  MDA  approval  to  use  an  alternative matrix.    The  CE  documents  the  specific  matrix  used  by  the  program  and  any  required MDA approval of an alternative matrix in the SEP.  Note that no approval is required for an  alternative  ESOH  risk  matrix  that  adds  only  quantitative  values  to  the  probability levels  consistent  with  the  probability  word  definitions  in  MIL-STD-882E.    However, only  the  MDA  can  approve  deviations  from  the  standard  MIL-STD-882E  probability level word definitions and severity categories.  As required by  Chapter 4, the PM uses the translation matrix in Attachment 3 to present the status of current High and Serious ESOH risks on the standard 5x5 risk matrix during technical and program reviews. 5.4.10.2.  Eliminates  hazards  where  possible  and  manage  ESOH  risks  of  hazards  that cannot be eliminated. integrates  ESOH  design  considerations  and  compliance 5.4.10.3.  Identifies  and requirements  into  the  SE  process.    Examples  of  this  include  but  are  not  limited  to  the following: 5.4.10.3.1.  Compliance with NEPA/E.O. 12114; 5.4.10.3.2.  Obtaining required design certifications (e.g. airworthiness); 5.4.10.3.3.  Prohibiting  or  strictly  controlling  the  use  of  banned  or  restricted hazardous  materials,  such  as  hexavalent  chromium  and  ozone  depleting  substances.  The CE shall not introduce new operational or maintenance requirements for out-of-production  Class  I  or  Class  II  Ozone  Depleting  Substances  unless  approved  by SAF/AQ. 5.4.10.4.  Includes the ESOH management planning in the SEP, not in the PESHE.  The SEP identifies the strategy for integrating ESOH considerations into systems engineering process and relationships between ESOH effort and other systems engineering activities, the ESOH risk matrix used by the program, and contractual ESOH requirements.  During the SEP approval process for MS B and C, both  the PESHE and the NEPA/E.O. 12114 compliance  schedule  must  be  provided  to  all  reviewers.    Additional  ESOH  sustainment considerations after MS C are included in the LCSP. 5.4.10.5.  Uses  the  PESHE  as  the  repository  for  program  office  ESOH  data,  to  include hazard  tracking  system  data,  hazardous  materials,  ESOH  compliance  requirements,  and environmental impact information necessary to support NEPA/E.O. 12114 analysis. 5.4.10.5.1.  For ESOH risks, the PESHE identifies hazards and records initial ESOH risk  assessments,  risk  handling/mitigation  measures,  target  risk  levels,  current  risk levels, event risk levels, and risk acceptance decisions.  See Chapter 4 for ESOH risk assessment, mitigation and acceptance. 5.4.10.5.2.  For hazardous materials, either imbedded in the system or used for system operations  and  maintenance,  the  PESHE  includes  information  on  the  locations, amounts, disposal  requirements, and special training requirements.  The  CE can use the  optional  Task  108,  Hazardous  Materials  Management  Plan,  in  MIL-STD-882E and/or  the  Aerospace  Industries  Association  (AIA)  National  Aerospace  Standard  AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 73 (NAS) 411, Hazardous Materials Management Program, as the basis for a program's HAZMAT management.  Both Task 108 and NAS 411 require a contractual listing of the  HAZMAT,  which  the  program  intends  to  manage.  The  contractual  listing categorizes each listed HAZMAT as Prohibited, Restricted, or Tracked. NAS 411-1, Hazardous Material Target List, provides a DoD-AIA agreed-upon baseline listing of HAZMAT for each category to use as the starting point in defining the program's list of HAZMAT. 5.4.10.6.  Uses  the  NEPA/EO  12114  compliance  schedule  to  document  completed  and projected analyses.  The CE should also incorporate analyses that are on the critical path in  the  IMP  and  IMS.

The PM and CE, in collaboration with the Implementing Command’s designated meteorologists,  ensure  the  identification  and  documentation  of  a  systems’  operational requirements  for  weather  products  and  services,  and  assessment  of  weather-related  risk during all phases of the life cycle, as appropriate.  AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 79 Chapter 6 ACQUISITION SECURITY 6.1.  Acquisition  Security  Overview.  Acquisition  Security  encompasses  holistic  security policies  and  practices  for  AF  systems.    Acquisition  Security  helps  ensure  that  all  systems  and programs  consider  lifecycle  risk  management  (LCRM)  and  execute  their  program  to  protect against  cyber-related information exfiltration, unauthorized or indiscriminate information disclosure, and tampering efforts should components fall outside positive physical control.  Security elements and considerations will be included and consistent across a program’s documentation (e.g., SEP, TEMP, LCSP, etc.). threats,  counterfeit  hardware/software  components, 6.2.  Acquisition Security Applicability.  The PM ensures: 6.2.1.  Security-related  system  requirements  are  fully  derived  and  integrated  into  overall system  requirements,  incorporated  into  the  system’s  design  through  systems’  security engineering (SSE), and thoroughly tested from a mission perspective. 6.2.2.  Security-related program requirements are included in RFP and contract language, to include requirements and evidence for a secure supply chain (e.g. statistical part inspections, facility inspection results, network certifications). 6.2.3.  Completed  Program  Protection  Plans  (PPP)  containing  security  requirements, including  critical  component  mitigation  and  management  schema,  are  included  in  the  SEP then transferred to the LCSP when a system transitions into the O&S phase; Product Support Providers (PSP) identified in the LCSP will be fully informed of their responsibilities. 6.3.  Program Protection Planning.  The PM ensures a program’s Critical Program Information and mission-critical functions and components are protected to keep technological advantages in and  malicious  content  out  IAW  DoDI  5200.39,  Critical  Program  Information  (CPI) Identification  and  Protection  Within  Research,  Development,  Test,  and  Evaluation  (RDT&E), DoDI  5200.44,  Protection  of  Mission  Critical  Functions  to  Achieve  Trusted  Systems  and Networks,  DoDD  5200.47E,  Anti-Tamper,  and  DoDI  5240.24,  Counterintelligence  Activities Supporting Research, Development, and Acquisition. 6.3.1.  Program  Protection Plan (PPP).  The PPP is  approved by the MDA.  Refer to DoDI 5000.02, Enclosure 3 for more information.  The PM completes a PPP per DoDI 5000.02 and maintains it throughout the life cycle of the program.  At a minimum, review the PPP every five years congruent with LCSP updates.  When a technology development activity transfers to  a  program,  IAW  AFI  61-101,  or  the  system  has  a  major  modification,  the  PM  becomes responsible for security impacts of the change and documents them in their program’s PPP.  The PM ensures that risk-reducing countermeasures for security-related threats are identified and recorded in the PPP.  An approved PPP is also included as supporting documentation in the attachment section of the ISP. 6.3.1.1.  The PM implements a plan, documented in the PPP, for managing and reporting Controlled  Unclassified  Information  (CUI)  consistent  with  DoDI  5230.24,  Distribution Statements  on  Technical  Documents,  DoDI  8582.01,  and  DoDM  5200.01,  Volume  4, DoD Information Security Program: Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI).  80 AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 6.3.1.2.  For  existing  systems,  PPP  requirements  for  modifications  can  be  satisfied  by updating or annexing to an existing PPP, creating a separate PPP for each modification, or  by  creating  a  new  PPP  for  the  entire  weapon  system  addressing  all  modification protection measures with provisions for annexes to cover future modifications. 6.3.1.3.  The PM creates an audit/inspection plan to periodically review the PPP, records this plan as part of the PPP, and ensures any findings or updates to the PPPs that involve significant High risks are sent IAW section 6.3.3. 6.3.2.  Critical  Program  Information  (CPI).    The  PM  ensures  that  CPI  is  identified  and properly  documented  in  each  program’s  PPP  along  with  risk  calculations  and  mitigations.  CPI  responsibilities  extend  across  a  system’s  entire  lifecycle  and  the  PM  re-evaluates  CPI when  there  are  program  changes  in  system  design,  major  modifications,  or  supply  chain changes.  CPI is defined in DODI 5200.39.  Some documents may distinguish between CPI and Critical Components, which can be subsets of CPI. 6.3.2.1.  CPI Identification Methodology.  The PM describes the methodology used or to be used for identifying CPI, including hardware and software critical components in the PPP.    CPI  identification,  CPI  risk  calculation,  and  CPI  risk  mitigation  development  is typically accomplished through vulnerability and criticality analyses. 6.3.2.2.  CPI must be protected against threats in development and operations. 6.3.2.3.  Inherited CPI is identified and properly documented in each program’s PPP, and is  included in  the program’s applicable risk assessments.   At a minimum, inherited CPI must be protected IAW the countermeasures outlined in the originating program offices’ PPP.    Inherited  CPI  is  defined  in  DoDI  5200.39.    Inherited  CPI  responsibilities  extend across a system’s entire lifecycle. 6.3.2.4.  After CPI is identified, the PM ensures that the current authoritative database is reviewed  for  programs  with  same  or  similar  CPI  for  horizontal  protection.    The  PM documents  review  results,  to  include  the  database  used,  and  risk  mitigations  consistent with DoDI 5200.39. 6.3.3.  The PM will notify  the MDA, and  appropriate AO or CIO, of significant  High  risks that  cannot  be  reasonably  addressed  through  technical  mitigation,  countermeasures,  or  risk management procedures per DoDI 5200.44, DoDI 8500.01, and DoDI 8510.01. 6.3.4.  The  PM  documents  how  the  program  addresses  SSE  requirements  in  Systems Engineering  Technical  Reviews  (SETRs),  functional/physical  configuration  audits,  and change analyses in the PPP.  Program managers document program protection-oriented entry and  exit  criteria  for  engineering/technical  reviews  in  the  PPP.    The  PM  ensures  that acquisition  security  requirements  are  thoroughly  tested  and  function  as  designed  prior  to system implementation.  The PM ensures the acquisition security requirements are assessed as part of the test and evaluation strategy. 6.3.5.  The  PM  records  how  acquisition  security  requirements  and  considerations  will  be managed during sustainment in the PPP. 6.3.6.  The PM documents, in the PPP, how program personnel and contractors will respond (procedures)  to  attempted  or  successful  CPI  compromises,  supply  chain  exploitations, counterfeit infiltration, and the compromise of CUI and/or classified information.  AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 81 6.3.7.

AT countermeasures are often associated with horizontal protection. 6.4.5.  Operations  Security  (OPSEC)  Plan.    The  PM  ensures  an  OPSEC  Plan  is  updated during the Material Solution Analysis through Production & Deployment acquisition phases.  The  goal  to  protect  a  system  or  capability’s  unclassified  critical  information  and  define indicators or operational profiles throughout the acquisition life cycle.  An OPSEC plan can be  part  of  the  countermeasures  listed  in  the  PPP.  It  is  the  responsibility  of  the  program  to determine what measures are essential to protect critical and sensitive information. Programs should identify OPSEC measures in their requirements documents when possible and passed to  resulting  solicitations  and  contracts.  Refer  to  DoDM  5205.02,  DoD  Operations  Security (OPSEC)  Program  Manual,  and  AFI  10-701,  Operations  Security  (OPSEC),  for  more information. 6.5.  Special  Access  Programs  (SAP).

Minimum protection standards for produced weapon system platforms will meet the intent of AFI 31-101, unless otherwise identified by the Lead Command.  AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 85 Chapter 7 PRODUCT SUPPORT REQUIREMENTS 7.1.  Product  Support/Sustainment  Planning  Overview.  Product support is a continuous and collaborative  set  of  activities  that  establishes  and  maintains  readiness  and  the  operational capability  of  a  system,  subsystem,  or  end-item  throughout  its  life  cycle.    A  product  support strategy is built around the integrated product support elements as identified in the DoD Product Support Manager Guidebook to integrate the phases of a system throughout its life cycle.  The product support strategy is the business and technical approach to design, acquire, test and field the  product  support  package  to  execute  the  sustainment  strategy.    It  begins  as  a  broad  concept and evolves into a detailed implementation plan documented in the LCSP. 7.1.1.  The  PM  retains  overall  responsibility  for  all  aspects  of  the  program.    The  PSM  is accountable  to  the  PM  for  the  execution  of  all  product  support  requirements,  to  include integrity programs; within the PM’s scope of responsibilities.  The PSM, with support from the  Implementing  Command,  develops  and  implements  a  comprehensive  product  support strategy  for  each  applicable  program.    For  more  information  on  PSM  and  product  support responsibilities refer to the PSM Guidebook, Integrated Product Support Element Guidebook, MIL-HDBK-502, Product Support Analysis, and 10 U.S.C. §2337. 7.1.2.  The  PSM  ensures  the  appropriate  concepts,  techniques,  and  analyses  necessary  to assure  achievement  of  defined  supportability,  sustainment/support  requirements  and objectives are applied.  The PSM is responsible to the PM to ensure that integrated product support objectives are considered and introduced as early as practical with a far-reaching life cycle  view  concerning  logistics  design  and  supportability  of  the  system.  This  activity requires integration of current product support concepts into preliminary planning to evaluate the various options for product support from the standpoint of life cycle cost and parameters to ensure balanced life cycle strategy.  The PSM conducts periodic reviews at least every five years  to  assess  and  revalidate  the  product  support  strategy  and  adjust  allocations  and performance requirements to  validated warfighter needs.  The PSM documents any product support strategy changes to the LCSP. 7.2.  Product Support Business Model (PSBM  ).  PSBM defines the hierarchical framework in which  the  planning,  development,  implementation,  management,  and  execution  of  product support  for  a  weapon  system  component,  subsystem,  or  system  platform  will  be  accomplished over  the  life  cycle  and  is  documented  in  the  LCSP.  The  PSBM  effectively  describes  the methodology  by  which  the  AF  intends  to  ensure  achievement  of  optimized  product  support through  balancing  maximum  weapon  system  availability  with  the  most  affordable  and predictable  total  ownership  cost.    The  PM  has  substantial  discretion  in  determining  the implementation  of  the  PSBM  and  develops  performance-based  agreements  with  warfighter customer(s),  Product  Support  Integrators  (PSI),  and  PSPs  to  meet  overall  performance requirements  and  support  validated  warfighter  needs.    However,  in  all  implementations  of  the PSBM, the PSM ensures that the support necessary to satisfy all of the Product Support Elements is within the scope of the agreements with one or more PSIs. 7.2.1.  Product Support Integrators (PSI).  The PSI is defined as an entity (within or outside the  Federal  Government)  charged  with  integrating  all  sources  of  product  support,  both  86 AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 private  and  public,  defined  within  the  scope  of  a  product  support  arrangement.    The  PSM may have more than one PSI supporting the Program. 7.2.2.  Product  Support  Providers  (PSP).    A  PSP  is  an  entity  that  provides  product  support functions. A PSP may be an entity within the DoD, an entity within the private sector, or a partnership between such entities. 7.3.  Weapon  System  Sustainment  (WSS).  WSS  is  a  subset  of  Readiness  and  O&S  funding that  includes  Contractor  Logistics  Support  (CLS),  Depot  Purchased  Equipment  Maintenance (DPEM),  Sustaining  Engineering,  TOs  and  organic  maintenance,  repair  and  overhaul.    Depot level reparables and consumables for organically managed aircraft and the Flying Hour Program are excluded from WSS.  WSS costs should be balanced with readiness needs and addressed as part of the product support strategy. 7.4.    Centralized  Asset  Management  (CAM).    CAM  is  the  management  and  execution  of sustainment  funding  by  one  AF  process  owner.    AFMC  is  the  designated  AF  CAM  Executive Agent  for  CAM-associated  funding  and  requirements  determination.    ANG,  Air  Force  Reserve Command  (AFRC),  and  AFSOC  utilize  CAM  processes  and  schedules,  but  manage  their  own requirements validation and execution of funds. 7.4.1.  MAJCOMs established timeframes/suspenses,  and  support  associated  reviews  as  documented  in  AFMAN  63-143, Centralized Asset Management Procedures. procedures,  meet utilize  CAM and the  PM 7.4.2.  MAJCOMs and the PM utilize the government registered system Centralized Access for  Data  Exchange  (CAFDEx)  for  defining,  validating,  prioritizing,  and  publishing  system sustainment requirements at the depot. 7.4.3.  MAJCOMs  and  the  PM  collaborate  with  HQ  AFMC  to  advocate  and  ensure  all requirements associated with systems’ support receive equitable consideration under CAM. 7.5.  Product Support Strategy.  The PSM develops and implements a comprehensive product support  strategy  in  support  of  the  PM’s  integrated  program  objectives  and  documents  this strategy  in  the  LCSP.    The  objective  of  the  product  support  strategy  is  to  achieve  operational readiness outcomes at an affordable cost.  The strategy is based upon a best value determination, evidenced through the Product Support Business Case Analysis (PS-BCA) process, assessing the best  mix  of  public  and  private  capabilities,  infrastructure,  skills  base,  past  performance,  and proven  capabilities  to  meet  set  performance  objectives  and  10  U.S.C.  §2464  (Core)  and  10 U.S.C. §2466 (50/50) requirements. 7.5.1.  Product  support  considerations  should  begin  prior  to  MS  A  with  early  requirements determination and continue through system design, development, operational use, retirement, and  disposal.    The  PM,  in  conjunction  with  the  PSM,  should  assess  system  design,  design changes,  and  sustainment  strategies  and  planning  to  identify  factors  impacting  future  O&S costs throughout these phases and develop strategies for reducing O&S costs or cost growth on the program. 7.5.2.  Performance based life cycle product support (or Performance Based Logistics [PBL]) strategies  are  to  be  employed  when  analysis  indicates  that  they  can  effectively  reduce  cost and improve performance. AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 87 7.5.3.  The PSM adjusts performance requirements and resource allocations across PSIs and PSPs  as  needed  to  implement  the  product  support  strategy.    The  PSM  is  responsible  for optimizing  product  support  during  the  development,  implementation,  sustainment  and subsequent  revalidation  of  the  product  support  strategy.    The  PSM  will  use  the  twelve Integrated  Product  Support  Elements  and  performance  metrics  to  achieve  operational outcomes for the system, subsystem, and components. 7.6.  Product Support Business Case Analysis (PS-BCA).  The PSM performs and documents a PS-BCA, in support of the PM’s integrated program objectives, to validate the product support strategy is cost effective, financially feasible, optimizes system readiness and manages risk, IAW 10 U.S.C. §2337, Life Cycle Management and Product Support. 7.6.1.  The PS-BCA will vary in size, scope, and level of detail depending on many factors, such as  fleet size, projected program  life  cycle, and depot  statutory  requirements.  The PS-BCA  uses  a  structured  methodology  to  aid  decision  making  by  identifying  and  comparing alternatives  by  examining  the  mission  and  business  impacts  (both  financial  and  non-financial), risks, and sensitivities.  In order to properly size and scope the PS-BCA, the PSM and PM must completely understand the appropriate level of analysis required to support the MDA’s decision making and tailor the PS-BCA accordingly. 7.6.2.  The  PS-BCA  is  supported  by  a  team  comprised  of  program  management,  life  cycle logistics,  financial  management,  cost  estimation,  small  business,  and  depot  sustainment personnel  who can assist  the PSM in  completing the PS-BCA.  The PSM conducts  the PS-BCA  using  government  personnel  to  the  maximum  extent  possible.    Refer  to  AFI  65-501, Economic  Analysis,  AFI  65-509,  Business  Case  Analysis,  AFMAN  65-510,  Business  Case Analysis  Procedures,  and  the  DoD  Product  Support  Business  Case  Analysis  Guidebook  for more information on PS-BCAs. 7.6.3.  The PS-BCA is  required for ACAT  I,  IA, and  II programs  but  is at  the discretion of the MDA for ACAT III programs.  For ACAT III programs, the MDA ensures rationale for not conducting a PS-BCA is documented in the LCSP. 7.6.4.  The PS-BCA is completed prior to MS-C and is an annex to the LCSP.  The PS-BCA will be initiated and updated to justify the product support approach defined in the LCSP. 7.6.5.  The PSM revalidates the PS-BCA at a minimum of every five years from the PS-BCA completion or revalidation date.  For legacy programs that are beyond MS-C and do not have a  PS-BCA,  the  PSM  is  not  required  to  conduct  a  PS-BCA  unless  a  change  to  the  product support strategy is  being  considered.  The PSM documents that the current  product  support strategy  is  affordable  and  effective,  obtains  SAF/AQD  approval  for  ACAT  I  and  IA programs, and includes this determination as an annex to the LCSP. 7.6.6.  SAF/AQD is the delegated approval authority for ACAT I and IA PS-BCAs and PS-BCA revalidations.  The MDA is the approval authority for ACAT II and III programs. 7.6.7.  The  PSM,  in  support  of  the  PM’s  integrated  program  objectives,  shall  maintain  a complete history of PS-BCAs over the course of the system life cycle to track decisions and understand how real-world operations cause program impacts. 7.7.  Life  Cycle  Sustainment  Plan  (LCSP).  The  LCSP  is  the  program’s  product  support execution plan for ensuring the system’s product support achieves and maintains the sustainment 88 AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 KPP/KSAs  while  controlling  overall  program  ownership  costs.    The  LCSP  is  integrated  across the  system  life  cycle  into  strategies,  planning,  implementation,  development,  production, fielding,  support,  sustainment  and  disposal.    The  LCSP  streamlines,  consolidates,  and  makes visible to leadership all aspects of the program’s product support strategy. 7.7.1.  The PM develops or updates an LCSP for all ACAT programs for MS A, B, C, Full Rate Production (FRP) and every five years after IOC until system disposal. 7.7.1.1.  Programs  in  the O&S phase  are required to  have an  LCSP, unless the program has an LCMP that meets the conditions stated in para 4.3.6. 7.7.1.2.  The  Implementing  Command  may  also  designate  other  efforts  requiring  the development of an LCSP. 7.7.1.3.  The  PM  performs  the  appropriate  level  of  analysis  necessary  to  develop  the product support strategy and support each MS decision. 7.7.2.  The PM updates the LCSP to reflect changes in the product support strategy, at major MS reviews, or at five year intervals, whichever comes first. 7.7.3.  The  PM  should  develop  and  coordinate  the  LCSP  IAW  the  OSD  approved  outline.  Tailoring strategies ensure that the information and coordination  requirements of the  LCSP are addressed in any integrated documentation. 7.7.4.  LCSP Approval and Concurrence. 7.7.4.1.  Prior to IOC, ASD (L&MR) is the approval authority for LCSPs on all ACAT ID,  IAM,  and  USD(AT&L)-designated  special  interest  programs,  and  the  MDA  is  the approval authority for all other LCSPs. 7.7.4.2.  After  IOC,  SAF/AQD  is  the  delegated  approval  authority  for  LCSPs  on  all ACAT  I and non-delegated ACAT  II programs,  and the MDA is  the approval  authority for all other LCSPs. 7.7.4.3.  The  Implementing  Command  provides  concurrence  on  the  LCSP  as  the Sustainment  Command.    Authority  to  provide  concurrence  may  be  delegated  to  the appropriate level. 7.7.5.  LCSP Annexes.  The PM will include the following annexes to the LCSP: 7.7.5.1.  Product  Support  Business  Case  Analysis  (PS-BCA)  or  other  analyses  used  to develop the product support strategy documented in the LCSP. 7.7.5.2.  Core Logistics Analysis. 7.7.5.3.  Preservation and Storage of Unique Tooling Plan (MDAP only). 7.7.5.4.  Intellectual Property (IP) Strategy (O&S phase only). 7.7.5.5.  Independent Logistics Assessment (MDAP Only). 7.7.5.6.  PPP (O&S phase only; included in SEP for pre-O&S programs). 7.7.5.7.  IUID Implementation Plan after MS C approval. 7.7.5.8.  Demilitarization Plans. 7.7.5.9.  Replaced System Support Plan. AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 89 7.7.6.  System modifications/upgrades may be added as a stand-alone annex to the platform LCSP.    The  annex  will  address  all  standard  LCSP  requirements  for  that  specific modification/upgrade.    Upon  completion  of  the  modification/upgrade,  the  platform  LCSP will  be  updated  to  incorporate  the  changes.    Each  modification  or  upgrade  should  have  a separate annex to the LCSP.  See Chapter 9 for more information. 7.7.7.  For more information on the LCSP refer to the Product Support Manager Guidebook and the Integrated Product Support Element Guidebook. 7.8.  Materiel  Fielding.  Materiel  fielding  is  the  process  by  which  AF  systems  and  equipment are delivered to and put into service by operational units in the field. 7.8.1.  The PM develops and documents materiel fielding plans starting at MS B and through the production and deployment phase.  The PM coordinates materiel fielding schedules and plans  with  the  Lead/Using  Command(s)  and  other  stakeholder  organizations  that  interface with,  or  provide  support  (e.g.  training)  for  the  materiel  being  developed.    It  is  at  the  PM’s discretion how they document materiel  fielding plans; they may be a stand-alone document known  as  a  Materiel  Fielding  Plan  (MFP),  an  annex  to  the  program  AS  or  LCSP,  or embedded within the AS or LCSP. 7.8.2.  At MS C and all subsequent production decision reviews, the PM updates the materiel fielding  plans  to  reflect  the  materiel  fielding-related  requirements,  or  any  changes  in  the user’s  system/product  delivery  and  acceptance  criteria,  the  user’s  operational/mission employment and the user’s requirements to  support operator  and maintenance training (e.g. Required  Assets  Available),  IOC,  and  FOC.    Materiel  fielding  plans  address  levels  of maintenance,  sources  of  repair,  sustainment  partnering  relationships,  source  of  supply, support equipment, training, and use of interim contractor support and/or contractor logistics. 7.8.3.  Consult  AFPAM  63-128  for  additional  guidance  and  information  related  to  the materiel fielding process. 7.9.  Product Support and Logistics Assessments. 7.9.1.  Logistics  Health  Assessments  (LHA).    In  order  to  self-inspect  and  reduce  product support  risk  for  all  programs,  the  PM  shall  periodically  assess  program  product  support planning  and  performance  using  the  LHA  assessment  tool.    PEOs  shall  determine  the frequency of the periodic assessment. 7.9.2.  Independent Logistics Assessments (ILA).  PEOs shall ensure that ILAs are conducted for all MDAP programs within their portfolios.  ILAs are required prior to MS B, C, the FRP decision (if FRP is more than 4 years after MS C), and every 5 years after IOC.  ILA results are annexed to the LCSP. 7.9.2.1.  PEOs tailor ILAs to program requirements using the LHA criteria as a baseline for assessing the program.  The ILA: 7.9.2.1.1.  Assesses the adequacy of the product support strategy (to include the core logistics analyses and establishment of organic capabilities). 7.9.2.1.2.  Identifies  system  design  and  sustainment  planning  features  that  impact readiness and future O&S costs. 90 AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 7.9.2.1.3.  Identifies  changes  to  system  design  that  could  reduce  costs,  and  effective strategies for managing such costs. 7.9.2.1.4.  Specifically assesses O&S costs to identify factors resulting in cost growth and provide strategies to reduce costs growth. 7.9.2.2.  PEOs  are  delegated  authority  to  charter  ILA  teams  and  ensure  they  are conducted by a team comprised of logistics, program management, engineering, financial management,  testing,  contracting,  small  business,  program  protection,  and  business experts  who  are  independent  of  the  program  office.    “Independent”  means  a  person outside  the  program  office  who  is  not  active  nor  has  recently  been  active  in  the management, design, test, production or product support planning of the program. 7.10.  Sustainment Metrics  .  The PM shall ensure sustainment metrics are collected, reported, and  analyzed  to  measure  program  life  cycle  sustainment  outcomes  that  satisfy  the  sustainment KPP/  KSAs  defined  by  the  user  IAW  the  JCIDS  Manual.    Sustainment  metric  calculation information can be found in AFPAM 63-128. 7.10.1.  Materiel  availability  measures  the  percentage  of  the  total  inventory  of  a  weapon system’s  operational  capability  (ready  for  tasking)  based  on  materiel  condition  for performing  an  assigned  mission  at  a  given  time.    Materiel  availability  information  can  be found in AFPAM 63-128. 7.10.2.  Materiel  reliability  measures  the  probability  that  the  system  will  perform  without failure over a specific interval.  Materiel reliability information can be found in AFPAM 63-128. 7.10.3.  TOC  measures  total  costs  as  identified  in  the  OSD  Cost  Assessment  and  Program Evaluation  (CAPE)  O&S  Cost  Estimating  Structure.    TOC  is  measured  IAW  OSD  CAPE Operating and Support Cost-Estimating Guide. 7.10.4.  Mean  Down  Time  (MDT)  measures  the  average  elapsed  time  between  losing Mission  Capability  status  and  restoring  the  system  to  at  least  Partial  Mission  Capability status.  MDT information can be found in AFPAM 63-128. 7.11.  Depot  Maintenance  /  Sustainment  Cost  Reporting  (50/50).  Depot  level  maintenance applies to work performed by both government and contractor personnel.  It includes all types of contractor support (CLS, ICS, requirements contracts) and partnership arrangements (Workshare Agreements, Direct Sales Agreements, and contract work excluded under the terms of 10 U.S.C. §2474), regardless of the source and type of funding and where the work is performed.7.11.1.  The PM supports HQ AFMC, IAW AFMC developed procedures, by: 7.11.1.1.  Tracking  obligated  depot  maintenance  funds  for  programs,  regardless  of  the source of funds, for the purpose of reporting these obligations to AFMC. 7.11.1.2.  Documenting  rationale  and  methodology  for maintenance funds. tracking  obligated  depot 7.11.1.3.  Ensuring  contracts  for  depot  level  maintenance  include  requirements  to document and report funding. AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 91 7.11.2.  To ensure compliance with 10 U.S.C. §2464 (Core) and 10 U.S.C. §2466 (50/50), the PM shall reflect the AF Core and 50/50 requirements in programmatic strategy and product sourcing documents throughout the program life cycle. 7.11.3.  The  first  time  a  system  or  other  item  of  military  equipment  is  determined  to  be  a commercial  item  as  defined  in  10  U.S.C.  §2464(c)  and  the  waiver  detailed  in  10  U.S.C. §2464(b) is sought, the PM includes in the determination, at a minimum:7.11.3.1.  The estimated percentage of parts commonality of the item version that is sold or leased in the commercial marketplace and the Government’s version of the item. 7.11.3.2.  The  value  of  unique  support,  test  equipment,  and  tools  that  is  necessary  to support the military requirements if the item were maintained by the Government. 7.11.3.3.  A  comparison  of  the  estimated  life  cycle  product  support  costs  that  would  be incurred  by  the  Government  if  the  item  were  maintained  by  the  private  sector  with  the estimated  life  cycle  product  support  costs  that  would  be  incurred  by  the  Government  if the item were maintained by the Government.  Government Depot Level Maintenance is also called Organic Depot Level Maintenance. 7.11.4.  The  PM  working  with  the  PCO  will  ensure  requirements  for  the  Contractor Sustainment  Report  are  included  in  all  major  contracts  and  subcontracts,  regardless  of contract type, valued at more than $50 million (then-year dollars).  Reference DoD 5000.04-M-1 and DI-FNCL-81831 for additional detail. 7.12.  Depot  Purchased  Equipment  Maintenance  (DPEM).  The  DPEM  Program  provides  a mechanism  to  collectively  identify,  plan,  program,  negotiate,  and  budget  for  depot-level maintenance  services  provided  by  organic  AF  depots,  depots  of  other  Services,  and  contract repair sources.  Refer to AFI 21-102, Depot Maintenance Management, for detailed information on DPEM. 7.13.  Depot  Source  of  Repair  (DSOR).  The DSOR process is the method by which the DoD postures its depot level maintenance workloads – organic, contract, or a combination of both.  It applies to workloads for hardware, software, new acquisitions, and fielded systems whether the Government  or  private  contractor  manages  the  system  or  subsystem.    For  fielded  systems,  the process is initiated as soon as a change in posture is considered. 7.13.1.  The  PM  initiates  DSOR  planning  early  in  the  life  cycle  and  documents  DSOR planning in the LCSP. 7.13.2.  The PM ensures DSOR determinations for programs, systems, sub-systems, and end items  are  processed  and  approved  through  AFMC.    The  PM  provides  AFMC  with  all required  data  needed  to  develop  the  DSOR  using  the  DSOR  Automated  Management System. 7.13.3.  AFMC acts as the AF executive manager for DSOR. 7.13.3.1.  SAPs  complete  the  DSOR  determination  process  using  the  classified  process defined by AFMC. 7.13.3.2.  DSOR determinations for Space programs, systems, sub-systems and end items will  be  routed  through  AFSPC  (as  Implementing  Command)  prior  to  submission  to AFMC. 92 AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 7.13.4.  The  DSOR  Determination  Process  is  comprised  of  several  activities,  each  tied  to specific events in the acquisition life cycle. 7.13.4.1.  The  PM  collaborates  with  AFMC the  core  depot-level maintenance and repair requirements.  This analysis is completed prior to MS A, and the results of the analysis are also documented in the Core Logistics Analysis Annex to the LCSP. to  determine 7.13.4.2.  The DSOR is an estimate of requirements for core depot-level maintenance and repair  capabilities,  the  associated  logistics  capabilities,  and  the  sustaining  workloads necessary  to  support  these  requirements.    The  DSOR  is  completed  by  MS  B,  and  it identifies  sources  of  repair  for  each  depot  level  reparable  at  the  system  and  sub-system level at a minimum. 7.13.4.2.1.  As  soon  as  practical  after  MS  A,  the  PM  shall  request  a  DSOR  from AFMC, ensuring sufficient time is available for the DSOR to be completed by MS B.  The PM provides AFMC with all required data needed to develop the DSOR.  When the DSOR is completed, the PM documents the DSOR in the LCSP. 7.13.4.2.2.  Prior  to  MS  B,  the  Implementing  Command  develops  a  DSOR, coordinates it with the other DoD components, issues a DSOR decision documenting the  results  of  the  coordinated  DSOR,  and  provides  a  copy  of  the  DSOR  decision  to the PM. 7.13.5.  The PM reviews the DSOR decision at the following intervals: 7.13.5.1.  DSOR review at CDR +90 Days.  This review is a validation and update of the MS  B  DSOR  for  each  depot  level  reparable  at  the  system  and  sub-system  level  of indenture.  Both AFMC and the applicable PM participate in the DSOR CDR+90 review. The  PM  is  responsible  for  validating  and  implementing  the  DSOR  CDR+90  review,  as well as documenting the results as part of the LCSP. 7.13.5.2.  At MS C and the FRP Decision. 7.13.5.3.  Every  5  years  to  document  continued  validity  of  the  DSOR  in  the  DSOR Automated Management System. 7.13.5.4.  As requested by AFMC or AFSPC as applicable. 7.13.6.  The  PM  informs  the  MDA  and  the  Implementing  Command  if  programmatic changes dictate a change in the DSOR or Depot Maintenance Activation Plan. 7.13.7.  Situations when a DSOR is necessary: 7.13.7.1.  New  acquisitions.    A  new  acquisition  includes  any  system,  item,  component, system,  subsystem,  or  software  that  results  in  a  new  requirement  for  depot-level maintenance.    DSORs  for  new  acquisitions  are  accomplished  on  the  total  anticipated inventory to be acquired.  For new acquisitions, the DSOR requirements are initiated no later than the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction phase and in sufficient time to obtain a DSOR decision for inclusion into the AS. 7.13.7.2.  New work.  New work, as related to requiring a DSOR, is a change in workload (hardware  or  software)  to  a  previously  postured  system,  sub-system,  end-item,  or AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 93 component that results in a change greater than 20% to the depot maintenance workload hours or cost. 7.13.7.3.  Modification Follow-on.  The DSOR applies to modifications (see Chapter 9) to existing systems for which the depot-level source of repair has been approved. 7.13.7.4.  Modification  Install.    This  is  not  a  long-term  sustainment  decision;  however, the  DSOR  needs  to  be  accomplished  to  determine  whether  contract  or  organic  sources should  accomplish  modification  installations  (see  Chapter  9)  that  are  depot-level maintenance workloads on the equipment upon which the new system is being installed.  This  helps  ensure  compliance  with  the  50%  contract  limitation  levied  by  10  U.S.C. §2466.7.13.7.5.  Overseas  Workload  Program  (OWLP).    Complete  DSORs  for  any  Source  of Repair (SOR) that involves the potential for accomplishment of depot-level maintenance by a source outside of the US.  DSOR packages are prepared and submitted in the same manner as for new acquisition packages.  This is applicable even in those instances where the results of the assessments appear to be obvious. 7.13.7.6.  Permanent  change  in  the  officially  designated  SOR  or  source  of  modification can  only  be  accomplished  through  a  DSOR  process  when  such  change  involves  an organic depot.  Complete a DSOR for a workload shift when there is a proposed change in  the  SOR  that  results  in  one  of  the  following  types  of  SOR  shifts:    From  assigned organic  depot  to  another  organic  depot;  from  assigned  organic  depot  to  a  contract;  or from  contract  SOR  to  an  organic  depot.    Changes  from  one  contract  repair  source  to another or consolidating several contract workloads does not require a DSOR. 7.13.8.  There is no waiver to the DSOR for depot-level maintenance workloads meeting the criteria  above;  however,  there  are  certain  categories  of  workloads  which  may  be  excluded from DSOR requirements.  DSOR submissions should identify depot maintenance workloads which  meet  identified  exclusion  criteria.    Categories  of  workloads  meeting  the  exclusion criteria include: 7.13.8.1.  Workloads  generated  by  Industrial  Facilities’  Equipment  located  exclusively within the depot maintenance complex and funded through the industrial fund. 7.13.8.2.  Modifications  that  are  to  be  performed  in  conjunction  with  scheduled  depot maintenance at the assigned SOR. 7.13.8.3.  Modifications  to  components  that  do  not  change  the  form,  fit,  function,  or integration of the component modified and do not change the basic part number, only the version (dash number change), as long as the SOR of the end-item does not change. 7.13.8.4.  FMS programs. 7.13.8.5.  US  Special  Operations  Command  (USSOCOM)  workloads  which  are  Major Force Program-11 funded. 7.13.8.6.  Automated  data  processing  equipment  workloads  that  are  not  for  national security  systems  (including  payroll,  finance,  logistics,  and  personnel  management applications). 94 AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 7.13.8.7.  Department of Energy (DOE) acquired, operated, and maintained systems that are supported by the Air Force. 7.13.8.8.  Medical  Equipment.    Management  and  sustainment  for  medical  materiel  for peacetime and wartime support is established under the AF Medical Support Agency as prescribed  in  AFI  41-201,  Managing  Clinical  Engineering  Programs.    Examples  of medical  equipment  exclusions  include  field  intravenous  fluid  reconstitution  and deployable oxygen systems. 7.13.8.9.  Test  Program  Set  (TPS)  software  when  the  cost,  capability,  and  hours  are included in the DSOR for its associated hardware (unit under test). 7.13.9.  Depot Activation.  Depot activation, planning and budgeting should begin as early as practicable in the acquisition cycle and be documented in the LCSP.  Investments are limited to long lead time items such as technical IP rights and special equipment, and do not include Military Construction until a DSOR has been completed. 7.13.9.1.  Prior  to  MS  B,  the  PM  develops  an  initial  plan  for  depot  activation  that includes  requirements,  funding,  and  operational  rationale.    The  initial  plan  will  evolve into the formal  Depot  Maintenance Activation Plan and is  continually  updated until  the depot  is  activated.    Data  is  kept  current  and  reported  until  all  depot  activation requirements are achieved.  The Lead and Using Commands advocate for programming and budgeting for depot  activation cost  and associated requirements for the sustainment of systems. 7.13.9.2.  The  PM  submits  program  depot  maintenance  activation  funding  data  line entries  across  the  FYDP  via  the  Web  Comprehensive  Cost  and  Requirement  System (CCaR)  System.    Detailed  instruction  on  CCaR  formatting  and  entries  are  published  in the CCaR Guidebook. 7.14.  Contractor  Logistics  Support  (CLS).  The  PM  considers  the  use  of  CLS  when developing  and  implementing  a  comprehensive  product  support  strategy.    Specific  funding guidance cannot  cover all contracts or situations; therefore, the PM, with  assistance and advice from  the  Financial Management  organization, must review  each proposed contractual  action  as described in AFI 65-601, Vol. 1. 7.14.1.  Interim Contractor Support (ICS) is a temporary support method for an initial period of  the  operation  of  the  system,  equipment,  or  end-item.    This  strategy  is  utilized  for controlling  capital  investment  costs  while  design  stability  is  being  achieved  and  complex product support elements are being developed. 7.14.1.1.  If  ICS  is  planned,  the  PM  ensures  the  AS  and  LCSP  include  a  plan  for transition from ICS to organic or CLS or a combination of contract and organic support and identify the beginning  and  ending dates of the  ICS.   ICS does not  negate the PM’s responsibility  to  achieve  an  organic,  CLS  or  a  Public-Private  Partnership  capability  as early  as  practicable  or  the  requirement  for  testing  and  evaluation  and/or  demonstrating the adequacy of a system, equipment, or end-item. 7.14.1.2.  The  Lead  and  Using  Command(s)  plan  and  advocate  for  programming  and budgeting for ICS cost and associated requirements for the sustainment of systems. AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 95 7.14.2.  CLS  and  other  support  requirements  are  programmed  for  and  executed  using  the types of funds and funding level approved by the Lead command and/or AF CAM Executive Agent,  AFMC.    The  PM  provides  the  Lead  Command  and/or  AF  CAM  Executive  Agent applicable copies of obligation documents and expense reports as agreed to or as stipulated by the AF CAM Executive Agent.   Reference AFI 65-601, Vol. 1 for more information.  The Lead  and  Using  Command(s)  plan  and  advocate  for  programming  and  budgeting  for  their portions  of  the  CLS  costs  and  any  associated  CLS  requirements  for  the  sustainment  of systems. 7.14.3.  CLS  contracts  are  written  based  on  characteristics  for  performance  based  logistics.  The  PM  establishes  flexible  performance  and  funding  ranges  commensurate  with  targets developed  in  conjunction  with  the  lead  command,  industry  partners,  and  other  relevant agencies  across  the  acquisition,  logistics,  and  user  communities.    These  contracts  can  link contract  incentives  to  performance  outcomes  while  allowing  the  AF  to  make  sound, enterprise-wide, capabilities-based resource decisions when deciding where to accept risk. 7.14.3.1.  CLS  contracts  are  crafted  to  identify  ranges  of  outcome  performance  with thresholds  and  objectives  and  the  target  price  (cost  to  the  user)  for  each  level  of capability.    The  contract  reflects  normal  operations  and  delineates  any  constraints  or boundary  conditions.    CLS  contracts  should  be  flexible  enough  to  address  a  range  of support  requirements  to  accommodate  changes  in  operational  tempo  (OPTEMPO)  or execution  year  funding  including  surge  or  contingency  requirements  to  the  extent  that they  can  be  defined.    If  used,  the  PM  documents  the  thresholds,  objectives,  and  target price of the CLS contract in the LCSP. in  collaboration  with  stakeholders, 7.14.3.2.  The  PM, identifies  needed  CLS requirements  and  makes  provisions  within  regulation  in  RFPs,  Statements  of  Work (SOW),  and  contracts  to  ensure  visibility  of  direct  contractor  costs  for  each  type  of support material and service that is being provided. 7.14.3.2.1.  The PM implements contract data requirements for tracking and reporting of total program cost and breakout of depot-level maintenance contractor and organic (50/50) costs. 7.14.3.2.2.  The PM reports all CLS costs consistent with AFI 65-601, Vol. 1. 7.14.3.2.3.  The  PM  ensures  CFO  report  is  submitted  for  CLS  contract  assets  in  the applicable APSR to AF/A4LR, IAW AFI 23-101. 7.14.3.2.4.  The  PM  ensures  compliance  with  DLMS  transactional  data  reporting IAW AFI 23-101. 7.14.4.  The  PM  coordinates  and  obtains  MAJCOM  agreement  on  unit,  base,  or  MAJCOM support  requirements  and  ensures  agreed-to  support  requirements  are  included  in  the  CLS contract.  Reference AFI 25-201, Support Agreement Procedures, for additional information. 7.14.5.  The PM obtains AF Metrology and Calibration (AFMETCAL) PG approval prior to contracting for commercial calibration services or when deviating from currently established calibration support plans IAW AFI 21-113. 96 AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 7.14.6.  The  PM  reviews  the  requirements  in  DoDI  3020.41,  Operational  Contract  Support (OCS),  when  making  logistics  sustainability  decisions  regarding  contract  support  in contingency operations outside the US. 7.14.7.  CLS  for  commercial  derivative/hybrid  aircraft  adheres  to  Federal  Aviation Administration  (FAA)  maintenance  standards,  directives,  and  bulletins  to  the  maximum extent  practical  for  commercial  derivative  aircraft,  IAW  respective  manufacturer’s maintenance  manuals,  military  technical  manuals,  approved  maintenance  concept,  and  the maintenance  contract.    For  further  information,  see  AFI  21-101,  Aircraft  and  Equipment Maintenance  Management  and  AFPD  62-6,  USAF  Airworthiness.    Reference  AFI  13-204, Vol. 3, Airfield Operations Procedures and Programs, for requirements applicable to support for Air Traffic Control and Landing Systems (ATCALS). 7.15.  Public-Private  Partnerships.  Public-Private  Partnerships  are  a  logistics  sustainment philosophy  involving  a  cooperative  agreement  between  DoD  and  private  sector  entities.  The purpose  of  public-private  partnerships  is  to  leverage  the  optimal  capabilities  of  both  the  public and  private  sectors  in  order  to  enhance  product  support  to  the  warfighter.    Public-Private Partnerships may be established in support of any of the integrated product support elements. 7.15.1.  Public-Private  Partnerships  are two  complementary agreements.    The  Partnership  Agreement  (PA)  establishes  the  overarching  organizational interactions,  assumptions  and  processes  the  stakeholders  agree  to  follow  during  the partnership.  The  Implementation  Agreement  describes  the  specific  workloads  to  be performed by the partners. typically  supported  by 7.15.2.  The  PSM  identifies  potential  public-private  partnerships  that  support  the  product support  strategy  early  in  the  life  cycle,  and  continuously  evaluates  potential  partnering opportunities for the duration of the life cycle. 7.15.2.1.  The  PSM  considers  public-private  partnerships  in  the  RFP  for  the  EMD  and documents these considerations in the LCSP. 7.15.2.2.  For fielded systems, the PSM considers the use of public-private partnerships to improve sustainment outcomes and documents these considerations in the LCSP. 7.15.2.3.  The PSM includes all PAs supporting the product support strategy in an annex to the LCSP. 7.15.3.  The  PSM  ensures  that  the  decision  to  enter  into  an  Implementation  Agreement  is supported by an analysis that is specific to the particular workload being considered for the partnership.  Note: This analysis is tailored to the particular Implementation Agreement and is different than the PS-BCA. 7.15.3.1.  The  analysis  considers  costs,  benefits,  opportunities,  risks,  investments, resource needs, constraints, 50/50 impacts, Core workload requirements, and the best use of public sector capabilities.  The analysis should assess potential partnership structures and management controls to ensure best value of the PPP to the U.S. Government. 7.15.3.2.  Analysis developed in support of the DSOR decision may be leveraged to meet this requirement. 7.15.4.  The PSM ensures cost data for all factors of production (e.g., direct labor, overhead, materiel, G&A) are captured for each Implementation Agreement supporting a public-private AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 97 partnership. The cost  data must be quantifiable and measurable utilizing generally accepted accounting practices. 7.15.5.  There are three basic types of public-private partnership arrangements: Direct Sales Agreements (DSA), Work Shares, and Leases. 7.15.5.1.  In  a  DSA,  dollars  flow  from  the  Government  buying  activity  directly  to  the contractor. The contractor, in turn, funds the depot by funds transfer to the Department of Treasury  for  the  goods/services  supplied  by  the  depot.  Those  funds  received  for  work performed in support of a DSA are credited to the depot’s Working Capital Fund rather than  getting  deposited  into  a  general  US  fund  account.  The  contractor  may  also  supply materiel to the depots in support of this type of arrangement. 7.15.5.1.1.  A  DSA  is  the  most  appropriate  type  of  public-private  partnership  when the supported product is immature or unstable. 7.15.5.1.2.  DSAs must be scrutinized carefully, and the pass-through costs associated with  this  type  of  arrangement  must  be  specifically  addressed  in  the  supporting analysis. 7.15.5.1.3.  The PSM includes the basis for selecting a DSA in the LCSP. 7.15.5.2.  A Work Share is an arrangement where the buying activity determines the best mix of work that capitalizes on each partner’s capabilities. The workload is then shared between the contractor and the organic repair entity. The contractor is funded through a contract,  and  the  organic  depot  is  funded  through  a  project  order.  The  partnering arrangement  between  the  organic  repair  entity  and  contractor  focuses  on  the  roles  and responsibilities  of  each  partner,  and  both  jointly  work  to  accomplish  the  overall requirement. 7.15.5.3.  Leases allow private industry access to facilities/equipment located at a Center of Industrial and Technical Excellence (CITE). Facilities or equipment located at a CITE may be made available to private industry to perform maintenance or produce goods, as long as it does not preclude the CITE from performing its mission. The goal is to make those  Government  owned  facilities  more  efficient  and  ensure  that  a  workforce  with  the necessary  manufacturing  and  maintenance  skills  are  available  to  meet  the  needs  of  the armed forces. 7.16.  Technical  Orders  (TO).  AF  TOs  provide  clear  and  concise  instructions  for  safe  and reliable  operation,  inspection  and  maintenance  of  centrally  acquired  and  managed  AF  systems and  commodities.    The  PM  ensures  that  fielded  TOs  are  technically  accurate  and  up-to-date.  Military  and  government  civilian  personnel  operating  and/or  maintaining  fielded  systems, subsystems,  or  end  items  (hardware  and/or  software)  utilize  and  comply  with  applicable Government-verified  TOs. terms  “Technical  Manual”  and  “manual”  are  used interchangeably  with  the  terms  “Technical  Order  (TO).”    The  AF  TO  System  consists  of  the methods,  procedures  and  the  AF  standard  TO  management  system  used  to  author,  publish, manage, distribute and use TOs.   The 7.16.1.  The  PM  ensures  TOs  and  Preliminary  TOs  (PTO)  are  developed  and  verified  IAW DoDM 5010.12, Procedures for the Acquisition and Management of Technical Data, TO 00-5-1,  AF  Technical  Order  System,  and  TO  00-5-3,  AF  Technical  Order  Life  Cycle 98 AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 Management.  Compliance with TOs is mandatory, except as explained in TO 00-5-1.  TOs for  FMS  systems  are  ordered  and  distributed  IAW  TO  00-5-19,  Security  Assistance Technical  Order  Program  (SATOP).

Divestiture Planning.  Program divestiture planning is the process used to layout the rate at  which  the  system  is  drawn  down;  document  decisions  on  whether  to  store  them  for  future spares requirements, send to Defense Logistics Agency Disposition Services, or to demilitarize.   The planned divestiture is shared with the PSM, Environmental Resources Manager (ERM), and Supply  Chain  Manager  (SCM).    The  SCM  will  ensure  this  information  is  put  into  the  AF computation  system  to  ensure  accurate  repair  and  buy  forecasts.    Divestiture  planning  begins when  the  lead  command  identifies  diminished  mission  requirements  for  a  system  due  to retirement,  lower  mission  requirements,  or  mission  changes  to  a  particular  platform.    The PM/PSM  ensures  appropriate  funding  to  execute  drawdown  plan  is  in  place,  update  program documentation  to  include  TOs  and  Programmed  Depot  Maintenance  (PDM),  and  ensures requirements are updated. from Service,  Disposal,  Reclamation, 7.20.

Modification Management Overview.  Modifications are changes to hardware or software to  satisfy  an  operational  mission  requirement  by  removing  or  adding  a  capability  or  function, enhancing technical performance or suitability, or changing the form, fit, function, and interface (F3I)  of  an  in-service,  configuration-managed  AF  asset.    Modifications  can  retain  existing capability,  extend  service  life,  correct  product  quality  deficiencies,  or  retain/restore  the functional  baseline  or  performance  specification.    Modifications  may  improve  the  operational availability of the item, transform or modernize defense business systems, or reduce ownership costs.    This  chapter  applies  to  weapon  systems  or  other  designated  systems,  subsystems,  and items requiring additional configuration control. 9.1.1.  All modification activities in continued materiel support of a weapon system shall be assigned  to  a  PM  or  designated  individual  with  the  responsibility  for,  and  authority  to accomplish  modification  program  objectives  for the  development,  production,  and sustainment  of  materiel  modifications  that  satisfy  user  operational  needs.    The  PM  has overall  management  authority  and  accountability  to  accomplish  the  development,  test  and evaluation,  production,  and  sustainment  objectives  for  a  given  modification  activity  and coordinate planning, programming, budgeting, and execution of the modification. 9.1.2.  The  PM  ensures  temporary  modifications  will  be  removed  from  the  host  system  or component at the end of the modification period specified unless converted into a permanent modification. 9.1.3.  Modification  requirements  are  documented,  reviewed,  and  approved  using  an  AF Form  1067  or  appropriate  JCIDS  documentation  as  described  in  applicable  10-series  AFIs.  The  AF  Form  1067  (also  referred  to  as  the  modification  proposal)  is  validated  by  the Lead/Using Command(s) and approved by the assigned PM.  It is the source for the technical requirements baseline.  For modifications involving an engineering change proposal (ECP), use  the  technical  description  of  the  engineering  change(s)  contained  in  the  ECP  for developing the technical requirements baseline. 9.1.4.  The PM ensures data required for temporary modifications is developed and acquired commensurate with the modification scope, duration, and employment.  The PM documents data  requirements  for  temporary  modifications  in  the  modification  proposal.    For  more information, refer to MIL-HDBK-61A. 9.2.  AF  Form  1067  Applicability.  The  AF  Form  1067  is  the  document  normally  used  to initiate  temporary  modifications  and  permanent  sustainment  modifications  for  fielded  systems and  equipment.    An  AF  Form  1067  can  also  be  used  to  document  the  submission,  review,  and approval of requirements for permanent capability modifications estimated to cost no more than ten percent of the minimum threshold dollar values for ACAT II programs.  The AF Form 1067 provides  a  means  to  track  modification  proposals  through  the  approval/funding  process,  and  to initiate  actions  to  maintain  configuration  control  of  items  affected  by  the  modification,  even though  the  capability  is  described  in  a  previously  approved  capability  requirements  document. The  form  provides  a  means  for  the  system  or  commodity  manager  with  configuration  control over the affected asset(s) to document the technical parameters associated with the modification, 108 AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 such  as  systems  engineering  requirements  and  recommendations,  impacts  to  logistics  support elements  associated  with  the  asset(s),  and  the  type  and  amount  of  funding  necessary  to accomplish the modification. 9.2.1.  Urgent Capability Acquisition modifications processing is described in DoDI 5000.02 and applicable 10-series AFIs.  A streamlined AF Form 1067 is generated and processed to summarize the modification requirement, to document the technical parameters necessary to satisfy  the  urgent  need,  and  to  initiate  the  modification  management  processes.    Other modification proposal documents, such as airworthiness directives produced by the FAA and Service  Bulletins  developed  by  defense  industry  manufacturers,  may  fulfill  modification proposal  documentation  requirements  and  be  attached  to  the  AF  Form  1067  for  recording required reviews and approvals. 9.2.2.  Lead,  Using,  and  Implementing  Commands  may  develop  standard  processes  for subordinate units to develop, submit and validate AF Form 1067s that meet the intent of this instruction.    For  example,  attaching  a  SEEK  EAGLE  request  (SER),  per  AFI  63-104,  can fulfill or supplement sections of the AF Form 1067. 9.2.3.  AF  Form  1067  may  be  used  to  initiate/establish  modification  requirement(s)  for temporary  modifications  or  permanent  capability  modifications  estimated  to  cost  no  more than ten percent of the minimum threshold dollar values for ACAT II programs, as described in DoDI 5000.02.  Consult applicable 10-series AFIs or AF/A5R Requirements Development Guidebook  for  detailed  information  on  the  AF  requirements  generation,  JCIDS  document preparation, and approval processes. 9.2.3.1.  The  requesting  organization  will  be  advised  to  complete  a  formal  JCIDS document  to  establish  the  user’s  requirement(s)  for  permanent  modifications  upon determination  at  any  point  of  the  AF  Form  1067  review/certification  process  that  the requirement exceeds thresholds defined in applicable 10-series AFIs. 9.2.3.2.  An  existing  JCIDS  or  AF  Form  1067  capability  document  for  a  temporary modification  can  be  used  as  justification  to  transition  to  a  permanent  modification; however,  for  long-term  sustainment  planning,  a  new  AF  Form  1067  for  the  permanent modification must be approved. 9.3.  Modification Types. 9.3.1.  There  are  two  primary  types  of  modifications,  temporary  and  permanent.    Refer  to AFI  10-601,  the  AF/A5R  Requirements  Development  Guidebook,  and  Attachment  2, Modification Proposal Process, in this instruction for guidance on the use of AF Form 1067, and for assistance defining, validating, and approving modification requirements. 9.3.2.  Temporary  Modifications.    Temporary  modifications  change  the  configuration  of  an item  to  enable  short-term  operational  mission  accomplishment,  or  to  conduct  T&E  of  new and  modified  equipment.    Temporary  modification  proposals  are  validated,  reviewed, approved as described in  AFI 10-601 and this instruction.  Refer to  AFI 65-601, Vol. 1 for AF policy on funding.  There are two kinds of temporary modifications:  Temporary-1 (T-1) and Temporary-2 (T-2). AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 109 9.3.2.1.  Temporary  modifications  are  managed  using  temporary  modification  baselines and  additional  supporting  documentation  attached  to  the  modification  proposal  for review, approval, and potential future transition to a permanent modification. 9.3.2.2.  T-1  temporary  modifications  change  the  configuration  of  an  item  in  order  to satisfy  short-term  operational  mission  requirements  by  adding,  modifying,  or  removing hardware  and/or  software  components  or  capabilities  in  a  manner  that  provides  an immediate  operational  benefit.    T-1  modifications  typically  involve  the  use  of  existing off-the-shelf or non-developmental items, including stock-listed equipment and materiel.  The T-1 modification proposal specifies the number of units to be modified, duration of installed  T-1  modification,  and  plans  for  removing  the  modification  converting  it  to  a permanent modification. 9.3.2.2.1.  T-1  modifications  shall  not  be  used  to  circumvent  the  requirements associated with permanent modifications, as prescribed in this instruction, or the lack of appropriate modification funding. 9.3.2.2.2.  T-1  modifications  are  normally  accomplished  and  supported  locally  by  a MAJCOM or base-level operational unit.  Depending on complexity, accomplishment and  support  may  be  provided  with  partial  or  full  depot  support.    In  such  cases,  the Lead/Using Command is responsible for funding the depot requirements. 9.3.2.2.3.  The  PM  shall  ensure  all  T-1  modifications  do  not  compromise  system capability  and  performance.    This  includes  the  PM  conducting  test,  in  conjunction with the appropriate Lead Command test organization, to ensure previously approved operational  safety,  suitability,  and  effectiveness  of  a  T-1  modified  asset  is  not compromised. 9.3.2.2.4.  T-1  modification  proposals  are  approved  by  the  PM,  Lead  Command certification/approval  authority,  and/or  AF/A5R  as  specified  in  applicable  10-series AFIs  or  the  AF/A5R  Requirements  Development  Guidebook.  Requests  must  include clear and compelling evidence that shows why the temporary modification is needed to support mission requirements.  The request should be coordinated through the Lead Command  (as  identified  by  AFPD  10-9),  to  the  PM  within  AFMC,  AFSPC  or AF/A5R as applicable.  T-1 modifications to AFRC or ANG systems, or if the system uses  NGREA  funding,  will  be  coordinated  through  AFRC  or  ANG,  and  Using Command  before  PM  approval.    T-1  modifications  with  duration  of  greater  than  1 year  must  be  supported  by  clear  and  compelling  justification/rationale  to  exceed  1 year.  Note: All existing T-1s submitted under the 5-asset/1 year rule of the July 2001 version  of  AFI  63-1101(superseded)  submit  a  new  modification  proposal  (AF  Form 1067) in lieu of a waiver. 9.3.2.2.5.  T-1  modifications  are  not  authorized  permanent  logistics  support  such  as peculiar support equipment and sustaining engineering support.  However, minimum essential  logistics  support,  including  verified  technical  data  or  interim  contractor support, essential for the temporary operation and sustainment of the modification in its designated mission environment will be provided, consistent with weapon system support concepts and/or product support strategies.  The Lead Command determines these minimum essential logistics support requirements in coordination with the PM. 110 AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 9.3.2.2.6.  T-1  modifications  may  be  used  to  satisfy  Urgent  Capability  Acquisition programs in the Year of Execution. 9.3.2.2.7.  All T-1 modifications will be removed from the host system or component at the end of the modification period specified on the approved AF Form 1067.  If a new AF  Form 1067 or other equivalent  requirements  documentation as described in AFI 10-601 is  approved to replace the T-1 with a permanent modification in lieu of removal,  use  acquisition  policy,  procedures,  processes,  and  funding  guidance described  in  this  instruction  for  converting  to  a  permanent  modification.    The  Lead Command  will  provide  the  PM  with  the  new  approved  AF  Form  1067  to  use  in updating  the  LCSP  to  ensure  permanent  life  cycle  management  issues  such  as supportability are addressed. 9.3.2.2.8.  Organizations  requesting  to  extend  the  installation  of  a  T-1  modification beyond the currently approved quantity or time period will prepare and submit a new modification proposal. 9.3.2.2.9.  T-1 modifications will be removed prior to host weapon system/component input  for  PDM  unless  otherwise  coordinated  between  the  Lead  command/Using organization  and  the  depot  maintenance  activity.    In  the  rare  situation  where  a  T-1 modification  is  not  removed  prior  to  PDM,  the  Lead  Command/Using  organization coordinate  with  the  performing  depot  maintenance  organization  to  ensure  the  T-1 modification  does  not  interfere  with  scheduled  maintenance  activities  and  that maintenance activities do not alter the installed T-1 modification. 9.3.2.2.10.  T-1 modification includes the inherent authority to install developmental components  of  the  modification,  conduct  testing  for  the  purposes  of  engineering investigations, and evaluate the modification to ensure the configuration satisfies the T-1 requirement and preserves the technical baseline. 9.3.2.2.11.  T-1 modified assets must be capable of being returned to their original or currently  approved  permanent  configuration  within  a  time  period  specified  by  the lead command (typically 48 hours) and documented in AF Form 1067. 9.3.2.2.12.  T-1  modification  proposals  will  describe  any  demilitarization  and disposition of components when removed. 9.3.2.3.  T-2  Temporary  Modifications.    T-2  modifications  are  used  to  evaluate, demonstrate, or exercise the technical performance, effectiveness, and/or the suitability of developmental  and/or  test  materiel  (hardware,  firmware  and  software)  capabilities.    T-2 modifications  are  also  used  to  install  and  operate  T&E-specific  support  equipment, Instrumentation and data recording equipment, telemetry systems, etc., on T&E assets. T-2  modifications  may  be  used  in  support  of  all  forms  of  T&E  activity,  including developmental  test  and  evaluation,  operational  test  and  evaluation,  and  Lead/Using Command-conducted  force  development  evaluation  activities.    An  AF  Form  1067  is required  for  T-2  mods.    T-2  modifications  to  AFRC  or  ANG  systems,  or  if  the  system uses NGREA funding, will be coordinated through AFRC or ANG, and Using Command before PM approval.  If applicable, document how aircraft airworthiness assessment and release will be addressed for the T-2 modification. Information on testing and evaluating systems can be found in AFI 99-103. AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 111 the  Lead  Command,  and  designated 9.3.2.3.1.  The  PM, test  agencies  will collaboratively  determine  the  number  of  assets  requiring  T-2  modification  based  on the  scope,  complexity,  and  length  of  T&E  activities.    They  will  collaboratively determine the configuration  management, installation,  operation,  sustainment,  and  funding requirements for each T-2 modifications. the  organizational  roles,  responsibilities,  and  procedures  for 9.3.2.3.2.  The  PM,  Lead  Command,  and  test  organization  may  create  a  single  T-2 modification proposal that covers a specified period of time or series of integrated test activities for the purpose of conducting incremental hardware and software T&E, or to identify a range of test support equipment that may be installed in support of T&E activities.    In  this  case,  the  T-2  modification  proposal  enables  the  PM,  Lead Command,  and  test  organization  to  install  and  remove  developmental  and/or  test materiel  (hardware,  firmware,  and  software),  or  specific  pieces  of  test  support equipment  on  designated  test  assets  without  the  need  for  repeated  configuration management  reviews  and  approvals.    It  also  allows  for  testing  of  current  aircraft stores  used  in  a  new  configuration  or  on  different  platforms.    In  all  these  cases,  the PM, Lead Command, and test agency should collaborate to maintain accurate and up-to-date  configuration  control  of  affected  test  assets,  and  to  coordinate  specific materiel installation requirements and activities. 9.3.2.3.3.  T&E organizations and Lead Commands assist the PM to ensure safety and performance of T-2 modified assets, and to ensure T-2 modified assets are provided sufficient sustainment support as needed to complete directed T&E activities. to 9.3.2.3.4.  T-2  modifications  are  maintained  on  the  test  asset(s)  for  as  long  as necessary  to  complete  T&E  activities  specified  in  approved  test  plans.    The  asset  is then  removed  and  returned its  original  or  current  approved  permanent configuration.  Instrumentation data collection and other support equipment used for both  current  and  future  test  data  collection  requirements  are  not  normally  removed after  each  test.    Such  T-2  modifications  will  be  removed  when  no  longer  required.  The  T-2  modification  approval  authority  authorizes  retention  or  removal  of instrumentation data collection and other support equipment on test assets during T-2 modification proposal review, validation, and approval processes. 9.3.2.3.5.  T-2  modifications  will  normally  be  removed  prior  to  host  weapon system/component  input  for  PDM  unless  otherwise  coordinated  between  the  Lead Command/using  organization  and  the  depot  maintenance  activity.    In  the  rare situation  where  a  T-2  modifications  are  not  removed  prior  to  PDM,  the  Lead Command/Using  organization  coordinate  with  the  programmed  depot  maintenance activity in updating the work package to describe the T-2 modification and ensure it does  not  interfere  with  the  programmed  maintenance  actions  and  that  maintenance actions do not alter the installed T-2 modification. 9.3.2.3.6.  A  T-2  modification  may  be  used  to  support  T&E  of  proposed  permanent configuration changes.  Upon the conclusion of T&E activity, the Lead Command, in coordination with the PM, determines if the modification will be fielded.  If fielded, the T-2 modification may remain in place upon completion of T&E activity while a permanent  modification proposal  is  processed and implemented  IAW the provisions 112 AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 of this instruction.  The T-2 modification will be upgraded to the approved permanent configuration as part of the permanent modification program. 9.3.3.  Permanent  Modifications.    Permanent  modifications  change  the  configuration  of  an asset/software  for  effectiveness,  suitability,  survivability,  service  life  extension,  and/or reduce  ownership  costs  of  a  fielded  weapon  system,  subsystem,  or  item.    Some  permanent modifications are further designated as safety modifications. 9.3.3.1.  Permanent  modification  efforts  will  comply  with  all  program  requirements commensurate with the respective program’s ACAT level.  The permanent modification baseline  and  additional  documentation  will  be  managed  by  being  attached  to  the modification  proposal  for  review  and  approval;  then  attached,  or  included  with  the appropriate existing acquisition program documentation. 9.3.3.2.  Permanent  modifications  are  used  to  satisfy  requirements  approved  IAW  AFI 10-601, and this instruction.  An approved permanent modification includes the inherent authority  to  install  developmental  components  of  the  modification  on  test  assets  for  the purposes  of  conducting  engineering  investigations,  developmental  testing,  and/or  other evaluation  of  the  modification.    An  approved  permanent  modification  also  includes  the inherent  authority  to  perform  trial  TCTO  kit  installations  and  TCTO  verification activities  on  test  assets  in  order  to  verify  the  installation  procedures  and  sustainment elements  associated  with  the  modification  prior  to  full-rate  kit  production  and/or  fleet-wide installation.  A separate T-2 Modification Proposal is required when trial TCTO kit installs,  proofing,  and  verification  activities  are  performed  on  operational  assets/combat coded aircraft instead of test assets/aircraft. 9.3.3.3.  Permanent modifications are only accomplished in response to an approved AF Form  1067  or  capability  requirements  document  as  described  in  AFI  10-601.    The  PM may initiate systems engineering tasks and preliminary design activities in anticipation of approved  modification  documentation,  but  must  consider  the  technical  complexity  and maturity of the stated need, along with programmatic risk, when preparing modification program  strategies  and  plans.    In  such  cases,  the  PM  will  limit  expenditures  to  the modification  financing  allowed  by  AFI  65-601,  Vol.  1  while  the  requirement  is undergoing  coordination  and  approval.    The  modification  requirement  must  be  fully documented  in  an  approved  modification  proposal/capability  requirements  document prior to starting the modification, usually at program initiation for modifications managed as  an  acquisition  category  program.    Permanent  modifications  funded  with  investment dollars are ACAT programs which fall under the ILCM chain of authority. 9.3.3.4.  Normally, permanent modifications will be installed across the entire inventory of  the  host  weapon  system  or  product  line.    However,  when  necessary  to  support operational mission requirements, permanent modifications may be installed on a subset of  the  host  weapon  system  or  product  line  inventory  with  the  approval  of  the  lead command, applicable PM, and AF/A5R as described in AFI 10-601 and this instruction. 9.3.3.5.  Permanent  modifications  may  be  conducted  in  discrete  installation  segments (e.g.,  “Group  A”  and  “Group  B”  TCTO  kit  segments)  when  necessary  to  support operational mission or deployment requirements or to manage the host weapon system or product  line  inventory  in  a  cost  effective  manner.    In  this  case,  the  content  of  each modification segment  must be approved by the  Lead Command and the  applicable PM. AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 113 Full  funding  policy  requires  that  all  TCTO  kit  segments  be  procured  with  a  single  year appropriation to field an increment of capability. 9.3.3.6.  Permanent  modifications  will  be  provided  full  logistics  support  (e.g.,  spares, support  equipment, item  management,  etc.) commensurate  with  the  host  system  or  component  maintenance  concept  and  product support strategy/plans.  See sustainment planning requirements in this instruction. IUID,  serialized technical  data, 9.3.3.7.  When  considering  modification  proposals,  approval  authorities  should  seek  the most  cost  effective  solution  over  the  system’s  life  cycle  and  determine  availability, suitability, and supportability of considered and selected solutions. 9.3.4.  Safety  Modifications.  Safety  modifications  are  permanent  modifications  that  correct materiel or other deficiencies which could endanger the safety or health of personnel, cause the  loss  of,  or  extensive  damage  to,  systems  or  equipment,  or  irreversible  significant environmental  impact.    Safety  modifications  are  also  conducted  to  correct  materiel deficiencies  which  caused  a  Class  A  mishap,  per  the  provisions  of  AFI  91-204,  Safety Investigations and Reports. 9.3.4.1.  Whether  directly  associated  with  a  Class  A  mishap  or  not,  permanent modification  proposals  designated  as  safety  modifications  shall  meet  the  following criteria: 9.3.4.1.1.  The  underlying  deficiency  has  been  determined  by  the  PM  to  be  a  “High risk” as defined in MIL-STD-882E of causing a mishap. 9.3.4.1.2.  The  PM  has  performed  a  risk  analysis  to  determine  the  proposed modification is technically feasible, operationally effective, and sustainable. 9.3.4.1.3.  The Chief of AF Safety concurrence with the lead command’s designation as a safety modification. 9.3.4.2.  Safety modifications will be given priority for funding and implementation over all other pending modifications. 9.3.4.3.  Safety  modifications  will  be  accomplished  IAW  with  the  provisions  of  this instruction;  however,  the  PM  may  deviate  from  the  provisions  of  this  chapter  when necessary  to  prevent  loss  of  life  or  minimize  risk  to  personnel.    With  the  prior coordination  of  the  Lead  Command,  the  PM  may  issue  interim  procedures  or  operating restrictions  as  necessary  prior  to  implementing  a  safety  modification.    Note:  Aircraft grounding can only occur IAW Chapter 4. 9.3.4.4.  Safety modifications which implement FAA-issued airworthiness directives and Service  Bulletins  will  comply  with  AFPD  62-6  and  AFI  62-601.    Modifications  which implement  FAA-issued  airworthiness  directives  and  Service  Bulletins  will  receive priority  for  funding  and  implementation  when  such  modifications  are  necessary  to preserve FAA certification and comply with Federal Aviation Regulations and standards 9.4.  Modifications to Assets Planned for Retirement (or Sunset Provisions).  IAW 10 U.S.C §2244a,  Equipment  Scheduled  For  Retirement  or  Disposal:  Limitation  On  Expenditures  ForModifications, modifications to any aircraft (i.e., a given tail number), weapon, or other item of equipment that the SECAF plans to retire or otherwise dispose of within five years after the date 114 AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 on  which  the  modification  would  be  completed,  are  prohibited.    Exceptions  to  this  prohibition include modifications which: 9.4.1.  Cost less than $100,000 per modification as described in the prohibition (any aircraft [i.e., a given tail number], weapon, or other item of equipment such as a space system). 9.4.2.  Have reusable items of value installed as part of the modification that  will, upon the retirement  or  disposal  of  the  modified  item,  be  removed  from  that  item,  refurbished,  and installed on another piece of equipment, and the cost of this modification, including the cost of removal and refurbishment of reusable items of value, is less than $1 million. 9.4.3.  Are designated as safety modifications. 9.4.4.  10  U.S.C.  §2244a  grants  authority  to  the  SECAF  to  waive  the  prohibition  when  the SECAF has determined the modification to be in the national security interest of the US, and has so notified the Congressional Defense Committees in writing. 9.5.  Additional  Modification  Requirements.  In addition to the general modification program requirements  prescribed  in  this  AFI,  modification  activities  involving  certain  types  of  materiel may impose additional management requirements on the using/lead command and PM. 9.5.1.  Modifications  in  response  to  validated  Urgent  Capability  Acquisition  requirements (JUONs,  JEONs,  UONs,  or  top-down  directed  QRCs)  will  be  streamlined.    For  Urgent Capability  Acquisition  program  modifications,  modify  the  minimum  number  of  systems needed  for  testing  and  in-theater  operations,  and  implement  as  line-replaceable  “Group  B” modification kits to the maximum extent possible.  Note: the Urgent Capability Acquisition ADM  fulfills  AF  Form  1067  parts  I,  II,  III  and  V;  Part  IV  is  accomplished  by  the  PM.    In conjunction  with  the  1067,  the  validated  QRC  requirements  document  will  be  used  for configuration  control  and  to  manage  installation  and  removal  of  Urgent  Capability Acquisition program modifications pending a Capability Transition Decision (CTD) that will determine  whether  to  return  the  system  or  subsystem  item  to  its  original  configuration  or implement an enduring capability.  See Attachment 2 for more information. 9.5.2.  Modifications requirements in AFPD 62-6 and AFI 62-601. to  aircraft  shall  comply  with the  airworthiness  certification 9.5.3.  A SER is used to establish aircraft-stores configuration certification requirements for aircraft stores configuration, flight clearance, TO, or other SEEK EAGLE data as described in AFI 63-104. 9.5.3.1.  Modifications involving non-nuclear munitions and their associated support and training  equipment  must  be  certified  IAW  AFI  91-205,  Non-Nuclear  Munitions  Safety Board.    Modifications  involving  nuclear  munitions  and  their  associated  support  and training equipment must be certified IAW AFI 91-103. 9.5.3.2.  Modifications  involving  directed  energy  weapons  must  comply  with  AFI  91-401, Directed Energy Weapons Safety. 9.5.3.3.  A SER does not replace AF Form 1067 and is not used to validate requirements for modification of aircraft or stores, but may be used to supplement an AF Form 1067. 9.5.4.  Modifications to nuclear certified equipment or items shall also meet the requirements in AFI 91-103 and AFI 63-125. AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 115 9.5.5.  Modifications  to  devices  which  transmit  electromagnetic  energy  must  include appropriate spectrum certifications required by DoDI 4650.01, Policy and Procedure for the Management and Use of the Electromagnetic Spectrum, AFI 17-220, Spectrum Management, MIL-STD-464,  Electromagnetic  Environmental  Effects,  and  MIL-STD-461,  Requirements for  the  Control  of  Electromagnetic  Interference  Characteristics  of  Subsystems  and Equipment. 9.5.5.1.

Modifications  to  defense  communications  system  equipment,  such  as  the  Defense Switching  Network  and  defense  communications  satellite  terminals  will  be  initiated, approved, and conducted in coordination with DISA, which designates DoD communications equipment  as  defense  communications  systems  configuration  items  (DCSCI).    DISA participates in configuration control processes and boards for DCSCI modifications executed by the AF. 9.5.7.  Modifications  to  intelligence  and  information  systems  and  networks  may  have  other requirements for modification programs (e.g., interoperability, certification and accreditation, cybersecurity, spectrum management) to consider. 9.5.8.  Modifications  to  SE/ATS  systems  will  comply  with  guidance  contained  in  this instruction.  Additionally,  modifications  which  affect  the  form,  fit,  function,  or  interface  of support  equipment/automatic  test  systems  with  supported  weapon  system,  sub  system,  or item will be coordinated with the designated support equipment PG for common SE/ATS, or the PM for unique SE/ATS. 9.5.9.  Modifications  involving  materiel  subject  to  serialized  item  management  (SIM)  will comply  with  DoD  and  AF  policies  which  require  AF  materiel  to  be  equipped  with standardized,  machine-readable  markings  that  provide  globally  unique  and  unambiguous identification  of  individual  assets.    Modifications  to  AF  materiel  that  are  so  marked  must comply with SIM policy provisions contained in DoDI 8320.03, Unique Identification (UID) Standards for a Net-Centric Department of Defense, DoDI 8320.04, DoDI 4151.19, and this instruction.  The PM shall ensure all modification activities are conducted in compliance with DFARS  211.274,  Item  Identification  and  Valuation  Requirements,  DFARS  252.211-7003, Item  Identification  and  Valuation,  DFARS  252.211-7007,  Reporting  of  Government-Furnished Property, and MIL-STD-130N, Identification Marking of U.S. Military Property. 9.5.10.  Serialized  item  management  (SIM)  requirements  such  as  IUID  registration  and marking  will be considered for temporary modifications based on the long term strategy  of 116 AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 the modification.  Assets used for temporary modification do not  require IUID marking and registration the AF Form 1067 states the strategy is dispose of the assets at demodification. 9.5.11.  Modifications  to  AF  Aircrew  and  Maintenance  Training  Device  will  comply  with guidance  contained  in  AFI  36-2251,  Management  of  Air  Force  Training  Systems. Additionally, modifications to prime systems which affect corresponding training equipment must  be  coordinated  with  the  appropriate  training  device  PM  as  part  of  the  overall modification. 9.5.12.  The  provisions  of  this  AFI  are  applicable  to  modifications  involving  AF  materiel sustained  via  CLS  contracts.    The  PM  ensures  CLS  contracts  include  specific  work requirements,  terms,  conditions,  and  deliverables  necessary  to  satisfy  the  modification  and configuration management requirements prescribed in this instruction. 9.5.13.  All  modifications  (temporary  or  permanent)  involving  FMS  or  security  assistance (SA)  assets  will  be  conducted  IAW  existing  management  arrangements  between  the  US Government  and  the  affected  foreign  government(s).    In  the  event  existing  management agreements do not specifically or sufficiently address the modification of FMS/SA assets, the PM contacts the AF Security Assistance and Cooperation (AFSAC) Directorate to coordinate modification  activities  involving  such  assets.    Modifications  pursuant  to  International Armaments Cooperation Agreement (IACA) will be conducted as described in AFI 16-110, US Air Force Participation in International Armaments Cooperation (IAC) Programs. 9.5.14.  Modifications  to  assets  under  the  management  purview  of  a  Joint  Program  Office (JPO)  are  conducted  IAW  the  designated  lead  service’s  modification  management process/procedures, or as established in a memorandum of agreement (MOA). 9.5.15.  Modifications to  systems  and equipment  developed by the Missile Defense Agency and  transferred  to  the  AF  will  comply  with  Configuration  management  procedures established  in  an  MOA between  the  AF  and  the  Missile  Defense  Agency.    If  AF  funds  are used to implement modifications to an in-service Missile Defense Agency-developed system, apply  the  requirements  of  this  instruction  in  addition  to  modification  program  management and/or  configuration  management  agreements  between  the  AF  and  the  Missile  Defense Agency. 9.5.16.  Modifications  to  AF  assets  on  loan  to  a  non-AF  agency  (e.g.,  Defense  Intelligence Agency,  security  assistance  organizations,  etc.)  will  be  initiated,  approved,  and  conducted IAW  a  MOA  between  the  AF  and  the  using  agency.    Modifications  to  AF-common  assets that  are  initiated  by  a  non-AF  agency  will  be  reviewed,  validated,  approved,  and  evaluated for  AF-wide  application  by  the  lead  command  or  commodity  manager  with  overall management responsibility for the asset. 9.5.17.  Technology  demonstrations  that  require  modification  of  an  in-service  AF  asset  in order to  evaluate the capability or technology will  be conducted  IAW this instruction.  The modifications  necessary  to  conduct  a  testing  demonstration  will  normally  be  approved  and installed as T-2 modifications. 9.5.18.  Modifications  to  aircraft  and/or  remotely  piloted  aircraft  that  create  a  change  to standard flight manuals must comply with the modification flight manual guidance provided in AFI 11-215.  Modification introduced changes include but are not limited to changes in the AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 117 cockpit  and/or  flight  crew  station,  changes  in  aircraft  and/or  system  operating  limits,  and changes to crew procedures. 9.6.  Modification  Fielding/Installation.  Permanent  modifications  are  generally  installed  on AF  weapon  systems  and  equipment  using  a  time  compliance  TCTO  prepared  IAW  this instruction and TO 00-5-15, Air Force Time Compliance Technical Order Process. Contractor-provided field  Service Bulletins and FAA-issued airworthiness  directives and Service  Bulletins may  also  prescribe  specific  modification  installation  procedures  and  requirements.  Temporary modifications  are  generally  installed  using  a  technical/engineering  data  package  that  describes the system/component engineering changes and outlines the component modification instructions to  be  accomplished.  This  data  package  must  be  approved  by  the  applicable  system/component PM  prior  to  installation.  The  PM,  Lead  Command,  and  test  agency  coordinate  as  necessary  to define specific technical/engineering data package requirements. 9.6.1.  The  PM  coordinates  modification  installation  requirements  and  timelines  with  the Lead Command and all affected organizations, including PSPs. The PM ensures modification installation activities do not begin until the Lead and Using Commands have identified and resolved any fielding issues associated with  the  modification. Additionally, the PM ensures sufficient  time  is  provided  to  develop  and  field  any  infrastructure  or  other  product  support requirements that will be necessary to operate and sustain the modification once it is fielded. 9.6.2.  Temporary  and  permanent  modifications  may  be  installed  at  base  level  by  organic unit/MAJCOM  personnel  that  initiated  the  modification  proposal,  by  PM  and  organic  field teams, and by contractor logistics support personnel, or a combination thereof. Modifications may  also  be  conducted  in  conjunction  with  depot  maintenance  activities,  at  contractor facilities, or a combination thereof. 9.6.3.  Upon  receipt  of  the  approved  modification  proposal  document  from  the  Lead Command,  the  PM  coordinates  the  modification  installation  schedule  with  all  affected organizations.  Prior  to  trial  kit  installation,  T&E  activities,  or  field  operation,  the  CE,  in support of the PM, ensures that any requisite certifications that accompany the modification are  in  place,  such  as  safety  of  flight  releases  or  airworthiness  or  nuclear  certifications.    All modification installation documents are approved by the PM. 9.6.4.  The  PM  ensures  all  modifications  include  a  plan  for  product  support  and  logistics requirements as described in this instruction and AFPAM 63-128 to ensure the modification is sustainable for the duration of its intended life cycle. Generally, this involves updating the existing weapon system LCSP to reflect modification requirements in terms of all applicable integrated product support elements.  For temporary modifications, the PM collaborates with Lead/Using  Command(s)  and  participating  test  organizations  to  determine  the  minimal support requirements and responsibilities necessary to accomplish, operate and maintain the modification during its limited installation lifespan. 9.7.  Modification Close-out.  Proper disposal will be ensured for modification kits that become excess.    For  configuration  control  and  management  purposes,  a  complete  copy  of  the modification package will be maintained IAW AFI 33-364, Records Disposition Procedures and Responsibilities and the AF Records Disposition Schedule. 118 AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 9.7.1.  All  temporary  modifications  will  close  out  when  they  are  replaced  by  permanent modifications  or  removed  from  the  host  system  or  component  as  specified  in  the  approved AF Form 1067. 9.7.2.  When a TCTO is or will be rescinded, and there are excess kits, the PM verifies that all  affected  systems/items/equipment  spares  have  been  modified  and  provide  supply  chain managers with disassemble/disposition instructions for the excess kits per AFI 23-101. 9.7.3.  Technical  data,  which  exists  prior  to  the  modification,  must  be  retained  until  all affected  systems/items/equipment  have  been  modified.  When  the  last  asset  has  been modified, all pre-existing data must be updated  by formal  changes or  revisions to  technical data/manuals, thus ensuring the current configuration is reflected. 9.7.4.  When  the  modification  has  been  completed,  shipping  or  disposition  instructions  for GFP  must  be  provided.  The  PM  is  notified  when  modification  kit  installation  has  been completed and the TCTO has been rescinded. 9.7.5.  Unsuccessful completion  of the modification must also  be documented including the reason for termination and any plan to recover assets. 9.8.  Modification Management Reporting.  See Chapter 11 for more information. AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 119 Chapter 10 ACQUISITION WORKFORCE MANAGEMENT AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT 10.1.  Purpose.  The  purpose  of  this  chapter  is  to  identify  acquisition  workforce  management and professional development requirements and responsibilities.  The 1990 Defense Acquisition Workforce  Improvement  Act  (DAWIA),  Chapter  87,  Pub.  L.  101-510,  codified  at  10  U.S.C. §1701-1764,  along  with  DoDD  5000.52  and  DoDI  5000.66,  provides  specific  minimumqualification  standards  of  those  personnel  performing  functions  integral  to  the  acquisition process and defines Critical Acquisition Positions (CAPs).  The law requires DoD to formalize career  paths  for  personnel  who  wish  to  pursue  careers  in  acquisition  to  develop  a  skilled, professional workforce. 10.2.  Acquisition Workforce.  For the purposes of this publication, the acquisition workforce is defined as those individuals assigned to positions having predominantly acquisition functions as defined by DoDD 5000.01, DoDI 5000.02, and DoDD 5000.52.  These positions are designated by acquisition coding in the manpower and personnel systems of record. 10.3.  Responsibilities  and  Authorities.  SAF/AQ  establishes  policy  and  provides  Service oversight for acquisition workforce management and professional development, and IAW DoDD 5000.52, is responsible for implementing the AT&L Workforce Education, Training and Career Development Program in the AF on behalf of the SECAF. 10.3.1.  AF Director, Acquisition Career Management (DACM).  The DACM  is  designated by  SAF/AQ  with  authority  to  assist  the  SAE  with  oversight  and  execution  of  acquisition workforce responsibilities.  Responsibilities of the DACM include: 10.3.1.1.  Developing, implementing, and overseeing policies and procedures for the AF Acquisition Professional Development Program (APDP). 10.3.1.2.  Representing  the  AF  as  point  of  contact  with  Defense  Acquisition  University (DAU)  and  other  DoD  Components  for  matters  relating  to  the  AT&L  Workforce Education, Training, and Career Development Program. 10.3.1.3.  Managing training matters associated with DAWIA implementation, including DAU course quotas. 10.3.1.4.  Managing  the  AF  share  of  the  Defense  Acquisition  Workforce  Development Fund. 10.3.1.5.

Establishing  and  maintaining  acquisition  career  management  information systems  for  training,  waivers,  continuous  learning,  certification,  and  acquisition personnel records review as needed to execute acquisition workforce responsibilities. 10.3.2.  Functional  Managers.    HAF  Functional  Managers,  appointed  IAW  AFI  36-2640, advise  the  DACM  on  acquisition  workforce  management  issues  and  assist  in  execution  of acquisition  workforce  responsibilities  in  respective  acquisition  functions.    HAF  Functional 120 AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 Managers and their appointed Career Field Manager (CFM) are responsible for ensuring, in coordination with the DACM, that AF requirements for acquisition certification (education, training,  experience,  and  the  career  pyramid)  standards  are  identified  to  OUSD  (AT&L).  HAF  Functional  Managers  shall  appoint  an  APDP  Functional  Manager,  as  applicable,  to manage APDP responsibilities for AF members in acquisition functional areas. 10.3.3.  MAJCOM  Commanders.    MAJCOMs  are  responsible  for  designating  military  and civilian  acquisition  positions  within  their  respective  organization.    MAJCOMs  will  ensure that acquisition positions are properly coded within the appropriate personnel and manpower data systems, and will review these positions periodically to ensure compliance with APDP coding  policy.    MAJCOMS  will  provide  a  single  MAJCOM  APDP  point  of  contact  to SAF/AQH, and will appoint qualified Functional APDP Managers and APDP representatives within their organizations, as required.  For more information, see detailed APDP guidance in the acquisition functional area of the AF Portal. 10.3.4.  Supervisors  of  Individuals  Assigned  to  Acquisition  Positions.    Supervisors  are responsible  for  notifying  personnel  in  their  organization  whose  positions  are  designated  as acquisition positions about their APDP responsibilities to include the functional category and level of required certification, and if appropriate, tenure, a program management agreement, and  all  statutory  requirements.    Supervisors  assist  acquisition  workforce  members  in developing  and  executing  Individual  Development  Plans  (IDP)  to  accomplish  APDP requirements including statutory and/or assignment-specific training/education, certification, tenure, and professional currency/continuous learning standards. 10.3.5.  Individuals  Assigned  to  Acquisition  Positions.    Individuals  assigned  to  acquisition-coded positions need to meet all APDP requirements including statutory and/or assignment-specific  training/education,  certification,  tenure,  and  professional  currency/continuous learning standards. 10.4.  Acquisition  Workforce  Management.      SAF/AQ  establishes  strategic  objectives  to develop and maintain a professional acquisition workforce with the numbers and mix of people with  the  right  education,  training,  skills  and  experience  to  execute  effective  and  successful  AF acquisition processes and programs. 10.4.1.  Human Capital Strategic Planning (HCSP).  The DACM office, in coordination with Functional  Managers,  develops,  reviews,  and  coordinates  HCSP  for  the  acquisition workforce,  in  harmony  with  AF  and  OSD  workforce  strategic  plans,  to  guide  acquisition workforce accession, succession, force development and force shaping planning. 10.4.2.  Review of Performance Appraisals. 10.4.2.1.  Military  Performance  Evaluations.    IAW  AFI  36-2406,  an  opportunity  is provided for review and inclusion of any comments on any appraisal of the performance of  a  person  serving  in  an  acquisition  position  by  a  person  serving  in  an  acquisition position  in  the  same  acquisition  career  field.    For  more  information  see  detailed  APDP guidance in the acquisition functional area of the AF Portal. 10.4.2.2.  Acquisition  Civilian  (non-contracting)  Evaluations.    Civilians  occupying acquisition coded positions outside of the contracting career field may request, but are not required  to  have  an  acquisition  functional  review  of  their  performance  appraisal.    This special acquisition functional review is in addition to the normal review processes. AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 121 10.4.2.3.  Contracting Career  Field Evaluations.   First  level  evaluation  of individuals on contracting coded positions is performed within the Contracting career chain.  The only exception is the performance evaluation of the senior official in charge of contracting for the  organization,  when  this  official  is  not  the  primary  PCO  for  the  organization.  AFFARS  5302.101  defines  SCO  in  charge  of  contracting  for  the  organization  as MAJCOM or DRU Senior Contracting Officials, Senior Center Contracting Officials, and operational contracting squadron commanders. 10.5.  AF  Acquisition  Professional  Development  Program  (APDP).  The  APDP  is  designed and  managed  to  facilitate  the  development,  credentialing,  and  maintenance  of  a  professional acquisition workforce.  Refer to the Career/APDP section in the acquisition functional area of the AF  Portal  for  detailed  information  and  implementing  instructions  (hereafter  referred  to  as “detailed APDP guidance”). 10.5.1.  Designating  Acquisition  Positions.    If  the  duties  of  a  position  (regardless  of  series) are predominantly acquisition functions as defined by DoDD 5000.01, DoDI 4205.01,  DoD Small  Business  Programs  (SBP),  DoDI  5000.02,  and  DoDI  5000.66  then  the  position  falls under  the  requirements  of  this  AFI  and  is  coded  as  an  acquisition  position  IAW  detailed APDP guidance.  In addition to Active Duty (AD) and permanent civilians, Active Guard and Reserve  (AGR)  and  civilian  over  hires  are  designated  as  acquisition  positions.    Non-AGR military guard and reserve positions may not be coded as acquisition positions. 10.5.1.1.  APDP  position  coding  relates  functional  coding  to  the  civilian  occupational (OCC)  series  or  the  military  AF  Specialty  Code  (AFSC)  as  outlined  in  detailed  APDP guidance. 10.5.1.2.  APDP  position  coding  identifies  required  certification  levels  based  on authorized position grade/rank/pay band as defined in detailed APDP guidance. 10.5.1.3.  Developmental  Positions,  as  defined  in  detailed  APDP  guidance,  are  coded Level II and may not be coded as CAP.  Before designating a position as Developmental, organizations must receive approval from the DACM / Deputy DACM. 10.5.1.4.  All civilian 1101 positions with predominantly (>50%) life cycle management duties are coded Program Management. 10.5.1.5.  All  63XX  positions  are  considered  acquisition  positions  and  are  coded  IAW detailed APDP guidance. 10.5.1.6.  All civilian 1102 and all AD and AGR military 64XX and 6C0X1 positions are considered acquisition positions and are only coded Contracting. 10.5.1.7.  All  civilian  1103  positions  are  considered  acquisition  positions  and  are  coded Industrial Property Management. 10.5.1.8.  All  civilian  1105  positions  are  considered  acquisition  positions  and  are  coded Purchasing. 10.5.2.  IAW  DoDI  5000.66,  certain  senior  level  acquisition-coded  positions  are  designated as  CAPs  based  on  the  criticality  of  the  position  to  an  acquisition  program.    Personnel assigned  to  CAPs  provide  needed  acquisition  experience  as  well  as  stability  and accountability to a program.  Positions that require CAP designation include: 122 AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 10.5.2.1.  General  Schedule  (GS)-15  (or  equivalent),  O-6,  and  higher  grade  acquisition-coded positions. 10.5.2.2.  Senior  Materiel  Leader  positions  of  acquisition  organizations  directly responsible for ACAT I, IA, and II programs are coded Program Management Level  III and require completion of the training statutorily required for ACAT I, IA, and II PMs. 10.5.2.3.  The  following  positions  that  are  a  subset  of  GS-14  (or  equivalent),  and  O-5 acquisition-coded positions: 10.5.2.3.1.  All acquisition-coded Materiel Leader positions. 10.5.2.3.2.  Civilian positions that have direct responsibility and accountability on an acquisition  program  or  on  an  effort  or  function  directly  supporting  a  program,  and have duties and responsibilities that require a three-year tenure for program stability.  For more information, see detailed APDP guidance. 10.5.2.3.3.  Military positions that have direct responsibility and accountability on an acquisition  program  or  on  an  effort  or  function  directly  supporting  a  program,  and have duties and responsibilities that require a three year tenure for program stability.  This  includes  all  acquisition-coded  positions  that  require  officers  graded  at  the  O-5 level  or  above,  such  as  O-5  Materiel  Leader  positions  that  are  filled  by  a  board process,  or  program  office  O-5  positions  that  require  an  O-5  officer  fill.    O-5 positions  that  are  routinely  filled  by  an  officer  of  lower  rank  do  not  require  CAP designation. 10.5.2.4.  Further  examples  of  positions  that  should  be  coded  CAP  can  be  found  in  the detailed APDP guidance. 10.5.2.5.  O-4/GS-13 (or equivalent)/or lower grade positions are not coded as CAPs. 10.5.2.6.  All CAPs are coded Level III. 10.5.2.7.  Individuals  assigned  to  CAPs  shall  be  Acquisition  Corps  members  (refer  to section  10.5.6)  and  shall  meet  AF  eligibility  standards  as  outlined  in  detailed  APDP guidance. 10.5.2.8.  Individuals assigned to CAP positions incur a three-year tenure. 10.5.2.8.1.  Civilians: DD Form 2888 is used to document the CAP tenure agreement.  Individuals  sign  DD  Form  2888  (Block  6a)  to  capture  tenure  agreement  and document in Defense Civilian Personnel Data System (DCPDS).  Approving Official on DD Form 2888 (Block 6c) is the hiring official. 10.5.2.8.2.  Military:  Assignment  Availability  Code  (AAC)  59  is  updated  for  the required tenure outlined in AFI 36-2110; therefore a DD Form 2888 is not required. 10.5.2.8.3.  Tenure periods for ACAT I and IA Program Managers are applied based on two distinct periods, Program Definition and Program Execution. A single PM will need to be assigned for each of these periods unless the PM is removed for cause or for  exceptional  circumstances  (e.g.  period  longer  than  appropriate  for  a  single person). AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 123 10.5.2.8.4.  Program Definition period – The tenure for ACAT I or IA PM will begin at  an  “initiation”  point  that  falls  between  AoA  and  6  months  prior  to  RFP  Release Decision Point (will vary by program) and will end at MS B. 10.5.2.8.5.  Program Execution period – The tenure for ACAT I or IA PM will begin following MS B approval and will run until IOC 10.5.3.  Key Leadership Positions (KLPs).  A subset of CAPs that require SAE oversight of position  qualification  requirements  and  tenure  are  designated  KLPs.    KLPs  are  determined and  designated  by  the  SAE.    Further  guidance  on  KLPs  is  outlined  in  AFI  36-1301  and detailed APDP guidance. 10.5.3.1.  Civilian:    DD  Form  2889  is  used  to  document  the  KLP  tenure  agreement.  Individuals sign DD Form 2889 (Block 6a) to capture tenure agreement and document in DCPDS.    Approving  Official  signature  on  DD  Form  2889  is  not  required  unless  the tenure period is other than the default criteria established by the SAE. 10.5.3.2.  Military:  Assignment Availability Code (AAC) 59 is updated for the required tenure  as  outlined  in  AFI  36-2110,  and  an  AF  Form  63,  Active  Duty  Service Commitment Acknowledgement, is completed to cover the tenure period (AFI 36-2107, Table 1-1), DD Form 2889 not required. 10.5.3.3.  Assignment  Availability  Code (AAC)  59  and  Active  Duty  Service Commitment  (ADSC)  are  removed  when  a  military  member  is  no  longer  serving  in  a KLP  position  and  prior  to  the  expiration  of  the  updated  tenure  period  with  an  SAE approved waiver. 10.5.4.  Certification.    IAW  DoDI  5000.66,  ensure  individuals  assigned  to  acquisition positions  meet  all  position  certification  requirements.    The  DACM  uses  an  online certification  tool  to  execute  the  certification  process.    Acquisition  workforce  members request certification via the online certification system found on the Career/APDP section in the  acquisition  functional  area  of  the  AF  Portal.    For  implementing  instructions  and  POCs, refer to the detailed APDP guidance. 10.5.4.1.  Criteria  for  Manual  Certification.   Under  exceptional  circumstances, certifications  may  be  processed  manually  rather  than  using  the  online  certification  tool.  As delegated by the DACM, Certifying Officials serve as the AF approval authority for issuing  acquisition  professional  certification  credentials  manually  IAW  DoD  policy.  Certifying  Officials  are  accountable  for  ensuring  current  functional  area  education, training,  and  experience  standards  are  met  for  certification.    The  DACM  issues  criteria for Certifying Officials.  Refer to the detailed APDP guidance for further information. 10.5.4.1.1.  Delegation of Manual Certification Authority.  The DACM may delegate certification  authority  for  Level  I,  II  and  III  Certification  to  the  following  (where Certifying Official criteria are met): 10.5.4.1.1.1.  HAF Functional Managers. 10.5.4.1.1.2.  MAJCOM Headquarters. 10.5.4.1.1.3.  Others as identified in detailed APDP guidance. 124 AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 10.5.4.1.2.  As delegated by the DACM, certification authority remains with the HAF Functional Manager for AF personnel assigned to DRUs, FOAs, Unified Commands, DoD Agencies, and other Components. 10.5.4.1.3.  As delegated by the DACM, HAF Functional Managers are the Certifying Official  for  GO  and  SES  members  who  meet  functional  category  acquisition certification requirements.  This authority may not be re-delegated. 10.5.4.2.  The DACM may delegate authority to adjudicate acquisition experience and/or approve  acquisition  course  fulfillment  for  purpose  of  documentation  in  the  system  of record to support certification.  Refer to detailed APDP guidance for further information. 10.5.5.  Professional Currency. 10.5.5.1.  Individuals  assigned  to  acquisition-coded  positions  maintain  professional currency  in  their  acquisition  functional  area  by  meeting  mandatory  DoD  and  AF Continuous  Learning  (CL)  standards  and  recording  CL  accomplishments  in  Acq  Now CL.    Responsibility  falls  upon  the  individual  and  their  supervisor  to  ensure  their  CL aligns  with  their  IDP  and  meeting  professional  currency  is  measured  in  performance feedback.    Individuals  on  acquisition-coded  positions  who  fail  to  meet  the  professional currency requirement are considered non-current.  For details on execution of CL, refer to the detailed APDP guidance. 10.5.5.2.  Officers  who  are  not  CL  current  as  of  the  Materiel  Leader  board  date  are ineligible.  Civilians who have not achieved the CL standard within a two month period after  becoming  non-current  are  not  eligible  for  acquisition  Civilian  Strategic  Leader Program  positions.    In  addition,  individuals  require  CL  currency  to  compete  for  special acquisition  career  development  programs  or  AF  acquisition  awards  unless  a  waiver  is granted.  For more details, refer to the detailed APDP guidance. 10.5.5.3.  Learning  is  a  job  responsibility.    Online  and  resident  courses  required  for APDP  certification  and  CL  may  be  accomplished  during  dedicated  duty  time  either during  the  normal  duty  day  in  the  workplace,  or  through  such  means  as  organization approved  alternate  work  schedules,  or  tele-commuting,  subject  to  supervisor  approval.  Individuals should not be expected to accomplish required training during off-duty hours. 10.5.5.4.  Guard  and  reserve  personnel  possessing  an  acquisition  AFSC  may  enroll  in DAU  courses  for  professional  development  including  all  DAU  courses  required  for DAWIA Level 1, 2, or 3 certifications. 10.5.6.  Defense  Acquisition  Corps.    The  Acquisition  Corps  is  a  pool  of  highly  qualified members of the Acquisition Workforce from which CAPs are filled. 10.5.6.1.  The Acquisition Corps is comprised of those persons who have met the grade, education,  training,  and  experience  standards  prescribed  by  DAWIA  and  implementing regulations,  and  who  have  been  granted  admission  to  the  Acquisition  Corps  by  the DACM.    Criteria  for  entrance  into  the  Acquisition  Corps  are  provided  in  the  detailed APDP guidance. 10.5.6.2.  Ensure  new  entrants  to  the  Acquisition  Corps  meet  all  Acquisition  Corps requirements and are a Lt Col (select), GS-14 (or equivalent), or above. AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 125 10.5.6.3.  Acquisition  professionals  should  demonstrate  appropriate  professional  and/or military standards as well as professional development in order to qualify for and remain in  the  Acquisition  Corps.    Examples:  any  military  member  having  an  Unfavorable Information  File  (UIF)  or  failing  to  continue  professional  development  commensurate with  rank,  will  not  be  considered  for,  or  are  disqualified  and  removed  from,  the Acquisition Corps. 10.5.6.4.  Members  of  the  Acquisition  Corps  are  expected  to  have  recent  acquisition experience  and retainability.  Members are removed from  the  Acquisition Corps if they have not served in an acquisition coded position within the last seven years.  In addition, Acquisition Corps members who have an approved retirement or date of separation and who are not currently serving in an acquisition position are removed from the Acquisition Corps. 10.5.7.  Waivers.    DAWIA  and  DoD  policy  permit  waivers  for  position  qualification requirements or tenure requirements on a case-by-case basis when in the best interests of the AF.    Process  waiver  requests,  coordination,  and  approval/disapproval  via  the  AT&L Workforce Waiver Tool.  Refer to detailed APDP guidance for further information. 10.5.7.1.  A  position  requirements  waiver  does  not  confer  certification  or  permanently obviate the acquisition related requirements of the position. 10.5.7.2.  Membership in the Acquisition Corps cannot be granted via a waiver. 10.5.7.3.  The  SAE  (or  designated  representative)  must  approve  waivers  from  the approved tenure commitment for KLPs. 10.5.7.4.  Delegation of Waiver Approval Authority. 10.5.7.4.1.  The  DACM  office  will  receive  KLP  waiver  requests  from  the  field  and coordinate Service Acquisition Executive disposition. 10.5.7.4.2.  Authority for Senior Contracting Official position requirements waivers is delegated  to  the  Deputy  Assistant  Secretary  (Contracting)  (SAF/AQC).    This authority may not be re-delegated. 10.5.7.4.3.  The  DACM  or  Deputy  DACM  grants  waivers  for  position  and  tenure requirements for all non-KLP CAPs. 10.5.7.4.4.  The  DACM  may  delegate  waiver  authority  for  non-CAP  position requirements.  Refer to detailed APDP guidance for further information. 10.5.7.4.5.  The  PEO,  Deputy  PEO,  or  Director  is  given  authority  to  waive  the requirement for a new tenure agreement when an individual is reassigned from a non-KLP  CAP  within  the  PEO  portfolio  or  directorate  to  another  non-KLP  CAP  within the  same  PEO  portfolio  or  directorate.    This  authority  does  not  obviate  the requirement  for  a  tenure  waiver  for  reassignment  when  a  tenure  agreement  is  in effect. 126 AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 Chapter 11 REPORTING 11.1.  Reporting  Requirements.  The  reporting  guidelines  below  are  applicable to  all investment  activities.  ACAT  designated  programs  shall  follow  DoD  5000  series  for  DoD  and Congressional reporting requirements. 11.2.  Investment Fund Reporting. 11.2.1.  Investment  Fund  Reporting.    The  PM,  or  equivalent,  ensures  all  efforts  with  AF RDT&E 3600 (Budget  Activity [BA] 1 through BA7)  and Procurement  (3010, 3011, 3020, 3021,  and  3080)  investment  funds  use  the  Comprehensive  Cost  and  Requirement  (CCaR) system to manage and execute program funds.  Investment fund reporting is documented on the IML. 11.2.1.1.  For  investment  funds,  acquisition/PEO  organizations  use  the  CCaR  system  to manage and execute funds unless a waiver is granted from SAF/AQX. 11.2.1.2.  The  program  or  activity  that  has  the  funds  included  in  the  program  baseline reports the funds.  Any funds outside of the baseline are reported by the activity with the direct budget authority.  Obligation and expenditure status is reconciled and published to Executive CCaR to align with the MAR schedule. 11.2.1.3.  CCaR  use  continues  as  long  as  investment  dollar  funding  is  available  for execution. 11.2.1.4.  Program  Office  must  enter  their  approved  and  required  budget  across  the FYDP.  The approved budget  is  equal  to  the enacted appropriation adjusted for enacted rescissions and approved reprogramming. 11.2.2.  All  activities  required  to  be  listed  on  the  IML  are  also  required  to  enter  basic program data into CCaR and Program Management Resource Tools (PMRT).  The PM shall enter  all  mandatory  data  at  initial  entry  onto  the  IML,  through  CCaR,  and  update  prior  to every  major  program  MS  and/or  following  any  significant  program  change.    The  PM reviews, updates, and ensures consistency of program data in CCaR and PMRT at least twice per  year  prior  to  the  1st  of  March  and  October  or  upon  request  from  SAF/AQX.    The minimal data entry into the applicable Acquisition Data Systems includes: 11.2.2.1.  Name,  program  description,  PE,  and  Budget  Program  Activity  Code  (BPAC).  Ensure  consistent  information  between  the  AML/IML  and  the  President’s  Budget  (PB) submission. 11.2.2.2.  Key Personnel (MDA, TEO or PEO, and PM). 11.2.2.3.  Contract  Data  (contract  number  [including  task  or  delivery  order(s),  if applicable], prime contractor name for each contract, and, business segment). 11.3.  Investment Master List, AML, and AML-Exempt activities. 11.3.1.  Investment  Master  List  (IML).    The  IML  includes  both  the  AF  AML  and  AML Exemptions.  Investment funds will map to an IML activity.  Program offices map RDT&E, Procurement investment funds, and program data by using the CCaR system to manage and AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 127 execute  programs.    Refer  to  Figure  11.1  for  information  on  the  relationship  between  IML, AML, and AML-Exempt categorization. 11.3.1.1.  IML Additions and Changes.  Submit all IML updates, additions, changes, and exemption requests using the CCaR IML tool.  SAF/AQX is the final approval authority for any IML additions.  See IML User Guide for additional guidance. 11.3.1.2.  IML  Review.    Any  organization  requiring  a  determination  on  an  activity  that could be considered either an AML or AML-Exempt activity should submit the activity to  SAF/AQX  for  categorization.    SAF/AQX  will  review  the  activity  and  determine categorization.    Activities  can  be  submitted  for  review  at  any  phase  in  the  program lifecycle;  refer  to  the  applicability  section  for  how  categorization  will  affect  program requirements. 11.3.1.3.  IML  Categories.    All  activities  on  the  IML  are  categorized  as  either  active  or inactive  dependent  upon  whether  investment  funds  are  being  executed.    In  addition, inactive AML programs are categorized as either open or closed dependent on phase and ACAT. Figure 11.1.  IML, AML, AML-Exempt Relationship. 11.3.2.  AF  Acquisition  Master  List  (AML).    The  AML  is  the  AF  master  list  of  all  ACAT programs regardless of the ACAT level or life cycle phase.  Programs will remain listed on the  AML  for  all  life  cycle  phases,  but  will  be  categorized  dependent  upon  funding  and whether  or  not  the  program  still  has  to  meet  DoDI  5000.02  requirements.  Inclusion  on  the AML  does  not  constitute  program  new  start  approval  and  does  not  constitute  authority  to commit, obligate, or expend funds. 128 AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 11.3.2.1.  The PEO shall ensure efforts meeting the following requirements are included on the AML: 11.3.2.1.1.  ACAT  I,  ACAT  IA,  ACAT  II,  ACAT  III  programs  responding  to  an approved requirement; this includes an AF Form 1067 Modification Request, JUONs, JEONs, UONs, or top down directed QRC activities as identified in AFI 10-601. 11.3.2.1.2.  Joint programs led by the AF or another DoD Component or Government Agency with AF participation. 11.3.2.1.3.  Any effort or program designated as “Special Interest” by the DAE, SAE, or an effort requested by SAF/AQ. 11.3.2.1.4.  Programs  with  acknowledged  SAP  elements  include  the  non-SAP components of the program on the AML. 11.3.2.1.5.  Legacy ACAT programs in the O&S phase not previously on the AML. 11.3.2.2.  Each  system  development,  upgrade,  or  modification  with  a  separate  APB  that meets the AML criteria is listed separately on the AML; however, activities with separate APBs  or  recurring  activities  (e.g.,  Lost  Cost  Modifications  and  Service  Bulletins)  that share a funding line may be combined into a single effort on the AML. 11.3.2.3.  Modification programs are marked inactive once deployed and managed as part of the overall system with an existing AML record.  O&S requirements in DoDI 5000.02 and this publication are met at the system level. 11.3.3.  AML  Exemptions.    AML  exemptions  capture  other  legitimate  AF  investment activities that are not acquisition programs. 11.3.3.1.  Exemptions  can  be  granted  for  replenishment  spares  procurements,  spares procurements,  commodity  procurements,  capital  equipment  replacement,  civilian  pay, developmental enterprise architectures/certifications, technology projects, or as directed by SAF/AQX.  SAF/AQX will review and approve each request for exemption on a case-by-case basis. infrastructure of sustainment, development 11.3.3.2.  Acquisition  SAPs  and  technology  efforts  managed  IAW  DoDD  5205.07,  SAP policy, AFPD 16-7, Special Access Programs, and AFI 16-701 are exempt from posting to the AML and Investment Master List. 11.3.4.  Investment-funded  programs  and  activities  are  added  to  the  AML/IML  in conjunction with the timeframe established for MAR reporting contained in section 11.4. 11.4.  Monthly  Acquisition  Report  (MAR).  The  PM  shall  complete  an  MAR  for  AML programs with funding greater than $30 million in RDT&E (3600) or $50 million in procurement (30XX) over the life of the program.  The PM shall complete an MAR for joint programs where the AF is the lead service; for joint programs where the AF is not the lead service, the MAR can be  waived  by  SAF/AQX.    MAR  reporting  refers  to  both  monthly  and  quarterly  reports, depending on ACAT designation. 11.4.1.  For  pre-MS  A  (ACAT  I  and  ACAT  II)  AML  programs  and  ACAT  III  AML programs  that  meet  reporting  thresholds,  MARs  are  required  quarterly.    Initiate  reporting once  PB  documents  are  submitted  to  Congress  (e.g.,  FY2020  activities  justified  in  FY2020 AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 129 PB documents).  MAR submissions for pre-MS A programs are only required to include the program assessment and top issues in preparation for program initiation. 11.4.2.  For post-MS A ACAT I and ACAT II AML programs, complete MARs as required.  Initiate  monthly  reporting  the  month  following  MDA  MS  approval,  or  designation  by  the MDA at MDD that the next MS is MS B. 11.4.3.  ACAT I and II program MARs include: Program Assessment and Top Issues (should be no more than 10); APB Data - Cost, Schedule, and Performance including PM estimate; Funding Execution Data; Contract  Information; Additional Assessments; Program Schedule and    Unconstrained  1537.    ACAT  III  program  MARs  consist  of  the  same  data  with  the exception of the Unconstrained 1537 (unless requested by SAF/AQX). 11.4.4.  The  PEO  or  equivalent  decision  authority  will  review  and  approve  each  MAR  in their portfolio by the 10th working day of each month. 11.4.5.  Programs  may  only  terminate  or  waive  MAR  reporting  with  the  approval  of SAF/AQX.    In  CCaRs,  programs  can  submit  a  change  request  for  termination  of  MAR reporting  when  90  percent  of  items  are  delivered  or  90  percent  of  the  investment  funds (RDT&E  and  Procurement)  funding  is  expended.    DBS  efforts  should  submit  change requests for termination prior to reaching FDD (or equivalent MS); they are not required to submit a MAR after FDD. 11.5.  Urgent  Capability  Acquisition  Reporting.  All  JUON,  JEON,  UON,  and  top-down directed QRC efforts will complete periodic MARs, regardless of dollar value. 11.6.  Modification Management Reporting. 11.6.1.  Report  and  Monitor  Program  Status.  The  PM  initiates  and  maintains  modification data to include, at a minimum, cost, schedule, performance, test, logistics, contracts, finance, risk,  and  earned  value  (as  applicable)  and  report  periodically  through  the  ILCM  chain  of authority.    All  modifications  managed  as  an  ACAT  will  comply  with  the  baseline  and documentation requirements specified in AFI 10-601 and this AFI. 11.6.2.  Permanent modifications are financed with investment funds per AFI 65-601, Vol. 1 and  managed  as  ACAT  programs.    Required  ACAT  life  cycle  management  documentation and  acquisition  reporting  (e.g.,  ADM,  SEP,  PPP,  LCSP,  MAR,  IUID  Implementation  Plan, etc.)  is  either  generated  and/or  updated  to  incorporate  the  modification  effort  as  described within  this  instruction.    Where  practical,  all  existing  documentation  is  updated  to  reflect modification efforts rather than generating separate documentation. 11.6.3.  Temporary  modifications,  whether  for  a  mission  or  for  test  and  evaluation,  will  be appropriately  documented  in  the  equipment  status  forms  (AFTO  781-series  or  244-series) and appropriate historical records (AFTO Form 95).  Annotation will be in the active portion (the AFTO Form 781A for instance) of the records.  The temporary modification annotation will remain there and be active until the equipment is returned to the original configuration.  Refer  to  TO  00-20-2,  Maintenance  Data  Documentation,  for  additional  guidance  on documentation requirements. 11.7.  Will-Cost  and  Should-Cost  Reporting.  Will-Cost  Management  and  Should-Cost Management  will  be  reported  for  all  ACAT  programs.    CCaRs  and  Executive  CCaRs  are  the 130 AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 authoritative data sources for AF Will-Cost/Should-Cost Management.  See section 4.14.3.3. for exemptions to Service Bulletins and Low Cost Modifications. 11.7.1.  All  ACAT  programs  are  required  to  report  on  their  Should-Cost  Management  in CCaRs. 11.7.2.  Should-Cost  reporting  is  accomplished  for  MS  reviews,  Defense  Acquisition Executive Summary (DAES) reviews, DAB reviews, quarterly reports to the SAE, quarterly OSD Business Senior Integration Group (BSIG) reviews, and other designated reviews. 11.7.2.1.  At MS A, B, and C Reviews, the PM will present  Should-Cost initiatives and should be prepared to present projected and realized Should-Cost Savings. 11.7.2.2.  Selected  PMs  and  PEOs  report  Should-Cost  initiatives  at  DAES  and  BSIG reviews.  The PM will include in their presentations Plans of Action and MSs for major Should-Cost initiatives with projected and realized Should-Cost Savings by FY. 11.7.2.3.  SAF/AQXE provides a comprehensive AF quarterly report to the SAE, which is the basis for the quarterly OSD BSIG review. 11.7.2.4.

Acquisition  Industrial  Preparedness  Overview.  10  U.S.C.  §2535,  Defense  Industrial Reserve,  and  DoD  Directive  4275.5,  Acquisition  and  Management  of  Industrial  Resources, addresses the acquisition, modernization, expansion, construction, and use of both severable and non-severable property as well as the retention, maintenance, and modernization of DoD-owned real property and plant equipment.  These responsibilities are assigned to USD (AT&L) and the Military  Service  Secretaries.    Government  Owned  Contractor  Operated  (GOCO)  AF  Plants  are considered  Industrial  Facilities  (as  opposed  to  Military  Installations)  and  consist  of  AF-controlled industrial  property that may be operated in  whole or in  part by  a contractor per AFI 32-9005,  Real  Property  Accountability  and  Reporting.    Per  AFPD  32-90,  SAF/IE  has  overall responsibility  and  oversight  of  AF-controlled  real  property.    This  responsibility  excludes  the acquisition and management of industrial facilities which are the responsibility of the SAF/AQ, reference  HAF  MD  1-10.    SAF/AQ  responsibility  for  industrial  facilities  is  delegated  to AFMC/CC,  who  can  further  delegate  this  authority.    AFMC  executes  this  authority  through AFLCMC’s  Acquisition  Environmental  and  Industrial  Facilities  Division.    This  section addresses the requirements of DoDD 4275.5 as it applies to acquiring, managing, and disposing of  the  AF-owned  industrial  facilities  defense  contractors  use  to  support  Government  contracts.  AF Reserve and National Guard industrial preparedness activities are not addressed here. 12.2.  Industrial  Facilities.  For  the  purposes  of  this  Chapter,  Industrial  Facilities  are  any  AF owned, leased, or controlled real property that is sustained for current or future contractor use to fulfill  government  research,  development,  test,  evaluation,  production,  maintenance,  or modification  contracts,  or  to  store  production  machinery  and  equipment  in  support  of  such activity.    This  includes  all  property  (other  than  material,  special  tooling,  military  property,  and special  test  equipment),  such  as  real  property,  buildings,  structures,  improvements,  and  plant equipment.    Real  property  includes  land,  buildings,  structures,  utility  systems,  improvements, and  appurtenances  thereto.    It  includes  equipment  attached  to  and  made  part  of  buildings  and structures  (such  as  heating  systems)  but  not  movable  equipment  (such  as  plant  equipment).  Note: Industrial Facilities are a subset of all AF-controlled real property; however, the term “real property” is used to describe types of industrial facilities. 12.2.1.  AFMC/CC  has  the  responsibility  of  managing  all  AF-owned  industrial  facilities.  AFMC  helps  other  MAJCOMs  acquire,  manage,  and  dispose  of  AF-owned  industrial facilities  in  conjunction  with  SAF/AQX  determination  of  which  industrial  facilities  the  AF needs to support its acquisition programs under the industrial property account. 12.2.2.  Funding  for  Air  Force  industrial  facilities  follows  the  guidance  provided  in  the current  version  of  the  DoD  Financial  Management  Regulations.    Other  types  of  funding including proceeds from the sale of excess industrial facilities may be used for the upkeep of industrial  facilities.    Lead  Commands  or  other  AFP  users  will  budget  and  fund  weapon system specific requirements needed at the AFPs. 12.2.3.  Consistent with the practice established in DoD issuances concerning upkeep of real property, most AF directives dealing with real property upkeep (for example, the 32 series of AFIs)  specifically  exclude  property  classified  as  industrial  facilities.    However,  AF 132 AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 procedures for the upkeep of industrial facilities should be consistent with those established for other categories of AF real property. 12.3.  Additional Responsibilities and Authorities. 12.3.1.  AFMC/CC,  or Environmental and Industrial Facilities Division), will: through their  delegated  authority (AFLCMC’s  Acquisition 12.3.1.1.

The  Air  Force  Industrial  preparedness  Program,  PE  0708011F  is  the  primary funding  mechanism  for  AF  industrial  facilities  with  lease  revenues,  proceeds  from  the  sale  of industrial  facilities,  and  development  or  acquisition  programs  using  AFPs  also  used  as contributing sources.   Funding  for  restoration projects  at  AF  industrial  facilities is  provided by Environmental Restoration PE 078008F. 134 AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 12.5.  Leases.  10  U.S.C.  §2667  provides  the  SECAF  authority  to  lease  non-excess  real  or personal  property.    This  is  a  tool  used  to  manage,  maintain  and  sustain  the  industrial  base capability  of  AFPs.    Such  leases  may  provide  for  the  alteration,  repair  or  improvement  of  the property by the lessee as payment of part or all the consideration for the lease.  The AF uses this provision to ensure AFPs remain safe, suitable and effective facilities for their intended purpose. DARLENE J.

MODIFICATION PROPOSAL PROCESS AND AF FORM 1067 DESCRIPTIONS A2.1.  Modification  Proposal  Process  Overview.  The  AF  Form  1067,  Modification  Proposal Process  starts  with  identification  and  documentation  of  a  modification  requirement  and  ends when  the  proposal  is  certified  and  approved  as  described  by  AFI  10-601,  the  AF/A5R Requirements Development Guidebook, and this AFI.  See Table A2.1, AF Form 1067 Process Flow  for  the  modification  proposal  process.    A  modification  proposal  is  the  document  or combination  of  documents  needed  for  approval  to  initiate  a  modification  action.  The modification  proposal  process  consists  of  four  steps:  1)  request  for  action  and  organization validation,  2)  Lead  and  Using  Command  validation,  3)  The  PM  reviews  and  approves  the technical requirements and solution, and 4) lead command certification and subsequent approval by the approval authority specified in AFI 10-601. A2.2.  Step 1, Request for Action and Organization Validation.  In this step the modification requirements  are  defined  and  validated  by  the  organization.    Individuals  (Program  Offices, Operational  Units,  Sustainment  activities,  etc.)  initiate  a  modification  proposal  by  completing Sections 1 through 10 of the AF Form 1067.  Temporary modifications requirements included in Section 10 of the AF Form 1067: number of units to be modified, total duration of the installed temporary  modification,  and  description  of  the  user’s/PM’s  /Lead  Command’s  plan  for converting the temporary modification into a permanent capability, or their plan for removing the modification from affected articles.  Modification proposals developed in response to a QRC will include this statement in Section 9 of the AF Form 1067 “This modification is needed to address a Quick Reaction Capability” if the ADM is not attached.  Depending on the nature of the need and  local  procedures,  the  initiator  may  recommend  a  solution  in  Section  10  of  the  AF  Form 1067.    After  completing  sections  1-10,  the  initiator  submits  the  AF  Form  1067  to  the organization-level  authority  for  validation.   The  organization-level  validation  authority completes  Section  11  using  procedures  established  by  the  parent  MAJCOM/FOA/DRU  and/or local  instructions.    The  organization  forwards  the  validated  AF  Form  1067  to  the  parent MAJCOM/FOA/DRU for further review and action.  Permanent capability modifications require a  KPP  and  KSA  Table  IAW  applicable  10-series  AFIs  or  the  AF/A5R  Requirements Development Guidebook. A2.3.  Step 2, Using Command and Lead Command/CFL Validation.  In this step, the using and lead commands/FOA/DRU state the modification requirement is a valid need that can be met by  a  materiel  solution.    Commands  may  comment  on  a  proposed  solution  if  one  is  provided, however  validation  of  the  need  is  not  approval  for  a  proposed  materiel  solution  and  does  not authorize implementation. A2.3.1.  The  initiator’s  parent  MAJCOM/FOA/DRU  headquarters  makes  a  validation recommendation  of  the  proposal  on  AF  Form  1067  Section  12  IAW  established MAJCOM/FOA/DRU  procedures.  The  Using  Command  forwards  the  validated  AF  Form 1067  to  the  applicable  lead  MAJCOM/FOA/DRU  or  other  AFPD  10-9  identified organization  for  further  review  and  action.    The  Lead  Command/FOA/DRU  or  AFPD  10-9 identified  organization  makes  a  validation  recommendation  of  the  proposal.    The  Lead Command  coordinates  the  modification  proposal  with  all  affected  using  commands  and supporting  organizations,  such  as   Lead Commands/organizations  forward  all  proposed  safety  modifications  to  the  Chief  of  AF logistics  support  units. training  and  156 AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 Safety  for  coordination  and  approval  of  the  safety  designation.    Once  validated,  the  Lead Command prioritizes the modification proposal  for funding and implementation.   The Lead Command  completes  Sections  13  through  22  of  the  AF  Form  1067  and  forwards modification proposals designated for funding and implementation to the applicable PM for initial technical evaluation, implementation planning, and cost estimation. A2.3.2.  For  modifications  involving  multiple  mission  variants  within  a  given  asset  design-series  that  are  assigned  to  multiple  Using  Commands  (e.g.,  AC/C/EC/MC/HC/WC-130, C/KC/RC/WC-135),  each  Using  Command  validates  the  modification  proposal  against assigned  assets,  and  the  Lead/Using  Command  responsible  for  the  largest  number  of  assets within  the  given  design-series  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  validating  and  approving the modification proposal.    If the modification proposal  is  ultimately  approved, each Using Command  determines  whether  or  not  to  implement  the  modification  on  its  assigned  assets.  Each  Using  Command  attaches  supporting  documentation  to  the  AF  Form  1067  to  record their decisions and to provide an audit trail for configuration control purposes. A2.4.  Step  3,  Program  Manager  Review  and  Approval  of  Technical  Requirements  and Solution.  The  PM  initiates  a  technical  evaluation.    The  CE,  in  support  of  the  PM,  determines preliminary  technical  impacts  and  systems  engineering-related  requirements  to  implement  the proposed modification.  Supporting documentation is attached to the form.  Such evaluations will include determination of the impacts to the host weapon system/component’s technical baseline, as  well  as  any  operating  certifications  or  restrictions  associated  with  the  host  weapon system/component,  such  as  airworthiness  certifications;  munitions  carriage/employment certifications;  ESOH security  certifications; Cybersecurity; SEEK EAGLE; etc.  This evaluation will also determine the potential impacts to, and  any  corollary  modification  requirements  for,  training  systems/devices  and  intelligence  or information-related  systems  and  networks  that  may  be  required  to  operate,  maintain compatibility with, or sustain the proposed modification. risks,  and  certifications; requirements, including  system/product A2.4.1.  The PM also determines the sustainment support needs associated with the proposed modification, reliability,  availability,  maintainability,  and supportability impacts and requirements.  The PM conducts life cycle risk and environment, safety, and occupational  health (ESOH) risk assessments for the proposed modification and identify any necessary risk acceptance documentation, safety certifications, or statements that must accompany the modification IAW DoDI 5000.02, MIL-STD-882E and this instruction.  Refer to AFPAM 63-128, Integrated Life Cycle Management, for guidance on life cycle risk management. A2.4.2.  The  PM  determines  if  the  modification  will  involve  or  produce  CPI;  if  CPI  is identified,  update  the  PPP  and  Acquisition  Security  Database.    The  PM  ensures  this  initial technical  evaluation  encompasses  all  configuration  items  and  external  interfaces  whose functional/product  baselines  may  be  affected  by  the  proposed  modification.    The  PM coordinates  these  initial  technical  and  programmatic  requirements  with  other  affected system/product  management  entities,  such  as  Air  Logistics  Complex  (ALC),  training program  offices,  technology  development  organizations,  etc.    The  PM  denotes  the modification  category  (i.e.  capability  or  sustainment  modification)  in  Section  39  of  the  AF Form  1067  and  in  applicable  modification  program  plans.    As  part  of  the  initial  technical evaluation  of a proposed modification and in  coordination with  the lead  command, the PM develops a preliminary strategy to implement the modification.  This strategy will address the  AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 157 management approach to implementing the modification and include, at  a  minimum,  a top-level  description  of  how  the  modification  should  be  funded,  developed,  tested,  produced, fielded,  and  supported;  and  an  estimated  schedule  for  implementing  the  modification.    The PM  coordinates  with  the  cognizant  contracting  officer  and  small  business  professional  to evaluate any impact to contracts. A2.4.3.  The  PM  develops  formal  cost  estimates  to  implement  the  proposed  modification IAW procedures prescribed in AFPD 65-5, Cost and Economics, as well as the AFI/AFMAN 65-500  series  publications  and  approved  AFMC/AFSPC  cost  estimating  techniques.    This estimate  includes  all  should  costs  and  affordability  costs  associated  with  the  development, operation,  and  sustainment  of  modification  throughout  its  expected  life  cycle.    Any  cost estimates provided by commercial vendors or other government agencies will be validated by the PM.  For temporary modifications, this estimate should include costs for host system de-modification  and  disposal  (as  applicable).  Additional  cost  estimating  requirements  are prescribed  in  AFPD  65-5,  applicable  AFI/AFMAN  65-500  series  publications,  and  this instruction. A2.4.4.  The  PM  attests  to  the  feasibility  of  the  proposed  modification  requirement  by including/appending  the  following  statement  in  Section  39  of  the  AF  Form  1067  “The capability  requirement(s)  described  in  this  modification  proposal  is  (are)  technically achievable and executable within the estimated schedule and costs identified herein.” A2.4.5.  The  PM  completes  Sections  23  through  42  of  the  AF  Form  1067  to  provide  the completed technical evaluation, preliminary implementation strategy and schedule, and cost estimates.  The information is  forwarded to  the lead  command and the SAF/AQ Capability Directorate  PEM  to  initiate/ensure  appropriate  funding  actions  are  taken.    The  PM  also provides  the  lead  command  with  any  other  specific  recommendations  concerning  the development, production, installation, testing, and sustainment requirements associated with proposed modification.  Depending on the complexity of the modification, the maturity and availability  of  critical  technology  elements  of  the  modification,  and  other  external  factors such  as  the  availability  of  funding,  the  PM  may  provide  the  lead  command  with implementation courses of action that offer alternative or evolutionary approaches to satisfy the operational requirement or stated need. A2.5.  Step  4,  Lead  Command  Certification  and  Approval  of  Modification  Proposal  (AF Form  1067,  Part  V).  The  Lead  Command  reviews  the  PM’s  initial  technical  evaluation, implementation  strategy  and  schedule,  and  cost  estimates,  and  then  either  approves  the modification  or  returns  it  to  the  PM  with  recommendation  for  changes  to  the  proposed  mod package.  The Lead Command checks the appropriate blocks in Part V and completes Sections 43 through 45 of the AF Form 1067.  The Lead Command obtains approval for temporary and permanent  modifications  in  both  the  capability  and  sustainment  categories  as  specified  in  AFI 10-601.  Once the modification is fully approved, funded, and designated for implementation, the Lead  Command  and  PM  revise  and  coordinate  a  final  implementation  strategy  with  affected Using Commands, support/sustainment organizations and other stakeholders associated with the modification.    Once  all  management  reviews  and  approvals  are  completed,  the  modification proposal will be catalogued and maintained IAW applicable records management requirements. Modification  proposal  documents  shall  be  maintained  to  record  the  user’s  requirement  and configuration control throughout the modified asset’s life cycle.  158 AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 A2.5.1.  Lead  Commands  coordinate  the  financing  for  validated/approved  modification proposals  with  the  PM  and  SAF/AQ  capability  directorate  PEM  with  cognizance  over  the affected  system,  subsystem,  or  item.  The  Lead  Command,  PM,  and  SAF/AQ  capability directorate PEM shall ensure modification requirements are funded as prescribed in AFI 65-601V1  and  as  documented  in  approved  Research,  Development,  Test  and  Evaluation (RDT&E)  Program  Budget  Exhibits  (R-1),  Procurement  Program  Budget  Exhibits  (P-1/P-3A). Refer to AFRCI 10-601 for additional guidance on AF Reserve Command requirements. A2.5.2.  Modification  requirements  financed  with  investment  funds  described  in  AFI  65-601V1 include but are not limited to development engineering data, modification engineering data,  and  installation  engineering  data;  procurement  and  installation  of  modification  kits; support equipment required to sustain the modified configuration; modification of equipment owned by an RDT&E organization used in RDT&E; and embedded information processing equipment and software. A2.5.3.  Modification programs may involve the use of multiple appropriation types in order to implement the modification.  Different  appropriations may be necessary to  fund separate and distinct tasks associated with the modification.  For instance, RDT&E funds will often be necessary to design and test the modification, while procurement funds are often required to produce and install the modification.  Modification programs will comply with full funding policy detailed in AFI 65-601V1 and DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 2A, Ch. 1. A2.5.4.  Any  modification  program  or  project  that  has  not  been  previously  justified  to  and approved  by  Congress  during  the  appropriations  process  for  the  fiscal  year  involved  is considered a new start.   When a determination has been made that  a modification proposal meets  new  start  criteria,  Congress  must  be  notified  via  either  a  letter  of  notification  or  a completed  Department  of  Defense  Form  1415-1,  Prior  Approval  Reprogramming  Action.  Modifications that result from FAA-issued Service Bulletins are also considered new starts if they  are  not  consistent  with  the  “Service  Bulletin”  budget  line  item  materials  provided  to Congress.    Refer  to  AFI  65-601V1  and  DoD  7000.14-R,  Vol.  3,  Ch.  6  for  specific requirements, processes, and stipulations associated with new start notifications. A2.5.5.  Individual modifications funded in the Low Cost Modification line generally satisfy an unforeseen requirement  for the entire weapon system inventory/fleet that is  estimated to complete within one year.  Total funding for Low Cost Modifications are consistent with AFI 65-601. A2.6.  AF Form 1067 Description. A2.6.1.  PART  I,  REQUEST  FOR  ACTION.

A successful outcome is not dependent on this issue; the technical performance goals or technical design margins will still be met. Minor reduction in technical performance or supportability, can be tolerated with little impact on program success. Technical performance will be below the goal or technical design margins will be reduced, but within acceptable limits. Moderate shortfall in technical performance or supportability with limited impact on program success. Technical performance will be below the goal, but approaching unacceptable limits; or, technical design margins are significantly reduced and jeopardize achieving the system performance threshold values. Significant degradation in technical performance or major shortfall in supportability with a moderate impact on program success. Technical performance is unacceptably below the goal; or, no technical design margins available and system performance will be below threshold values. 5  Severe degradation in technical performance or supportability; will jeopardize program success; or will cause one of the triggers listed below (Note 1) Note 1:  Any root cause that, when evaluated by the cross-functional team, has a likelihood of generating one of the following consequences is rated at Consequence Level 5 in Performance:  -Will not meet Key Performance Parameter (KPP) Threshold  - Critical Technology Element (CTE) will not be at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 4 at MS/ A  - CTE will not be at TRL 6 at MS/ B  - CTE will not be at TRL 7 at MS/ C  - CTE will not be at TRL 8 at the Full-rate Production Decision point  - Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL)* will not be at 8 by MS C  - MRL* will not be at 9 by Full-rate Production Decision point  - System availability threshold will not be met   * MRLs will be calculated IAW the DoD Manufacturing Readiness Assessment Deskbook.     170  AFI63-101/20-101  9 MAY 2017 Table A3.3.
