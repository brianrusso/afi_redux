Program Overview. 1.1.  Statutory  Authority:  10  USC  §  165,  Combatant  Commands:  Administration  and Support 1.2.  Objective:  Identify  the  processes  and  responsibilities  required  for  AF  personnel  to provide  required  support  to  the  headquarters  of  unified  combatant  commands  and subordinate unified combatant commands for whom the Air Force has been designated as the Service Combatant Command Support Agent (CCSA). 2.  Process    for    Support    of    the    Headquarters    of    Unified    and    Subordinate    Unified Combatant Commands. 2.1.  The AF’s administrative and logistical  support of the headquarters of the CCMDs, the U.S.  Element  of  the  North  American  Aerospace  Defense  Command  (USELEMNORAD), and  the  subordinate  CCMDs  are  through  inter-service  support  agreements  and  funding  for operation and administration of the CCMD headquarters staff. 2.2.  The  Inter-service  support  agreements  conforming  to  AFI  25-201,  Intra-Service,  Intra-Agency, and Inter-Agency Support Agreement Procedures, are between the AF installations hosting  the  headquarters  facilities  and  tenant  CCMD.  HQ  US  Cyber  Command  support  is unique  in  that  the  headquarters  is  not  located  on  an  Air  Force  installation.    Table  1  lists headquarters of unified combatant commands and subordinate unified combatant commands for whom the Air Force has been designated as the Service CCSA and the host installations.  Common-use facility construction, operations, maintenance and repair are the responsibility of the CCSA and are “customarily non-reimbursable.” Table 1.  AF CCSA Commands and Host Installations.

All  funds  are  distributed  via  the  Automated  Funds Management System. 2.3.2.  Each CCMD will annually submit its unfunded headquarters support requirements (funding and end strength) to its supporting MAJCOM listed in Table 2.  The unfunded CCMD  headquarters  support  requirements  will  be  compiled,  coordinated  and  submitted by the MAJCOM as part of its Program Objective Memorandum (POM) development. 2.3.3.  The  MAJCOM’s  POM  will  be  submitted to  the  AF/A8P  for  deliberations  by  the Air Force Corporate Structure (AFCS). 2.3.4.  CCMDs have access to their programmed financial data in the AF’s database after the POM is finalized. 2.3.5.
