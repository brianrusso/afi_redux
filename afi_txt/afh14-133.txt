The responsibilities of the intelligence analyst have never been more important.  The increasingly  complex  global  environment  demands  analyst  Airmen  be  steeped  in  tradecraft fundamentals, conversant on the Intelligence Community (IC) and other service capabilities, and prepared to tailor their analysis skills to the operational challenge at hand.  The purpose of this non-directive publication is to help guide every analyst Airman in answering this call.  It  provides  reference  and  instructional  material  for  the  analyst  Airman  working  in  the  air, space,  and/or  cyber  domains—whether  junior  or  seasoned;  officer,  enlisted,  or  civilian; regular  AF,  reserve  or  guard;  and  serving  AF,  joint,  national,  or  combined  missions.    The content  of  this  publication  is  intentionally  broad  in  nature,  ranging  from  foundational doctrine and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to analysis applications and lessons learned. 1.1.2.  The long-term intent for this publication is to have it reside as a series of interactive and  up-to-date  web  pages  online,  with  links  to  IC  and  AF  directives,  templates,  checklists, and other references.  The online version will serve as a useful tool for the analyst Airman to quickly link to  their specific analysis topic of interest.   Upon publication of this handbook, the AF intends to initiate steps to transition this document to an online, interactive version. 1.1.3.  The  publication  is  organized  with  foundational  information  in  six  main  chapters followed  by  useful  lists,  lessons  learned,  criteria,  forms,  guides,  and  an  annotated bibliography  in  the  attachments  to  aid  analyst  Airmen  in  their  day-to-day  missions.    This document also includes links to appropriate websites with additional support material. 1.2.  Intelligence  Analysis.  Intelligence  analysis  is  a  cognitive  capability—both  art  and science—applying  tools,  judgments,  processes,  and  tradecraft  to  data  and  information  to  create and  deliver  new  intelligence,  insights,  and  knowledge,  with  the  goal  of  providing  decision advantage  to  commanders,  decision  makers,  and  intelligence  customers.   Analysis  is foundational to  ISR, a key capability of ISR, a core competency in  ISR, and integral to  Global Integrated ISR (GIISR). 1.2.1.  Intelligence  as a  Foundation.  Analysis is  a significant capability  that extends across all  AF  ISR  Enterprise  activities  in  support  of  the  full  range  of  military  operations  and assigned  national  security  missions.    According  to  AF/A2’s  vision  for  the  future  of  AF Intelligence, AF ISR 2023:  Delivering  Decision Advantage, a “fundamental job of AF  ISR Airmen  is  to  analyze,  inform,  and  provide  commanders  at  every  level  with  the  knowledge they need to prevent surprise, make decisions, command forces, and employ weapons.”  AF intelligence  analysis  provides  unique  capabilities  to  focus  on  and  address  AF  mission requirements.    These  same  unique  capabilities,  coupled  with  an  Airman’s  distinctive air/space/cyber  perspective,  serve  to  complement  and  fully  integrate  with  analysis  that supports broader defense and national mission requirements. 1.2.2.  Intelligence  Analysis  as  a  Capability.    Analysis  is  one  of  four  enduring  AF  ISR capabilities,  the  other  three  being  Collection  Operations,  Targeting,  and  Operations 6 AFH14-133  27 SEPTEMBER 2017 Integration.  Note:  Refer to the AF Future Operating Concept:  A View of the AF in 2035.  The AF delivers intelligence analysis capability to meet Combatant Command (CCMD) and service needs.  As with any other capability area, intelligence analysis is supported by the full range  of  Doctrine,  Organization,  Training,  Materiel,  Leadership  and  Education,  Personnel, Facilities, and Policy (DOTMLPF-P). 1.2.2.1.  Doctrine.    Doctrinal  considerations  include  analysis  fundamental  principles; analysis policy and procedures; common lexicon and terminology; recognized TTPs; and shared best practices and lessons learned. 1.2.2.2.  Organization.    AF  ISR  organizations  range  from  the  tactical  to  the  strategic level,  operating  in  a  layered,  distributed,  and  mutually  supporting  construct.    AF initiatives  to  develop  the  intelligence  analysis  capability  additionally  impact  the presentation of analyst Airmen to joint organizations such as combatant commands, joint task forces, and national analysis entities. 1.2.2.3.  Training.  Considerations include initial, mission, and continuation training; AF Specialty Code (AFSC) entry-, intermediate-, and advanced-level courses; and associated certification. 1.2.2.4.  Materiel. architectures necessary to equip, operate, maintain, and support analysis activities.   Materiel  concerns technologies,  systems,  and involve tools, 1.2.2.5.  Leadership and  Education.  The  attention and priority of leadership  is  essential to  growing  the  analysis  capability.    Additionally,  undergraduate-  and  graduate-level education opportunities inside and outside of the AF play a major role. 1.2.2.6.  Personnel.    Planning  and  resourcing  for  qualified  personnel  are  required  to effectively conduct analysis missions. 1.2.2.7.  Facilities.    Cleared  and  adequately  equipped  buildings  and  other  structures  are required to conduct analysis.   Codified  direction  and  guidance  with  clearly  defined  roles, 1.2.2.8.  Policy. responsibilities, processes, and terminology are fundamental to unity of effort across the AF ISR enterprise. 1.2.3.  Intelligence Analysis as a Core Competency.  ISR core competencies are the primary knowledge,  skills,  abilities,  and  behaviors  required  to  perform  AF  ISR  missions  and ultimately  enable  decision  advantage.    The  AF  strives  to  collectively  maintain  sufficient expertise in its competencies.  Because analysis is critical to and a driving factor in the other three  enduring  capabilities,  all  AF  ISR  professionals  train  in,  maintain,  and  exercise,  at  a minimum, basic analytical capabilities and critical thinking skills wherever they are assigned.  Additional information on this subject can be found in Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) 14NX, Parts I and II, AFSC 14NX Intelligence Officer Career Field Education and Training Plan and CFETP 1N0X1, Parts I and II, AFSC 1N0X1 All Source Intelligence Analyst Career Field Education and Training Plan. 1.2.4.  Intelligence Analysis and Global  Integrated ISR (GIISR).  As of 2017, GIISR is one of the AF’s five enduring core missions as identified in strategic guidance, including the AF Future Operating Concept and the USAF Strategic Master Plan.  A key strategic AF vector is  to  maintain  a  robust  and  flexible  GIISR  capability,  supported  by  big  data  analytics.    AF AFH14-133  27 SEPTEMBER 2017 7 strategic  guidance  highlights  the  need  for  the  service  to  deepen  its  assessment  of  potential adversaries, professionalize ISR analysis, and restore analytic competencies.  In turn, AF ISR vision  and  strategic  planning  establish  analysis  as  one  of  five  priorities  for  ISR  and  tie  the AF’s mandate to deliver decision advantage to its ability to provide world-class, multi- and all-source intelligence across all domains.  Accurate, timely, relevant intelligence analysis is not only integral to operations, but in many ways drives military operational decisions. 1.3.  Operational  Viewpoint-1  (OV-1).  Figure  1.1,  AF  Intelligence  Analysis  OV-1,  offers  a high-level  depiction  of  AF  intelligence  analysis.    The  OV-1  describes  analysis  operations, capabilities,  and  activities  within  the  greater  AF  ISR  Enterprise  and  explains  how  analysis supports  GIISR  operations.    Together,  analyst  Airmen  and  the  AF  Intelligence  Analysis Enterprise  (AFIAE)  ensure  mission  success  and  decision  advantage  now  and  into  the  future.  Subsequent chapters of this publication explain in more detail the various elements of the OV-1. Figure 1.1.  AF Intelligence Analysis OV-1. 1.3.1.  As  indicated  by  Item  1  in  Figure  1.1,  at  the  heart  of  AF  intelligence  analysis  is  the cadre  of  officer,  enlisted,  and  civilian  ISR  professionals  who  are  trained  in  intelligence analysis  and  production.    These  analyst  Airmen  apply  critical  thinking  and  advanced analytical  skills  to  turn  information  and  raw  data  into  timely,  actionable,  and  relevant intelligence products and services, leading to improved knowledge. 1.3.2.  Analyst  Airmen  perform  their  missions  within  the  framework  of  the  overall  joint intelligence  process  of  Planning  and  Direction,  Collection,  Processing  and  Exploitation,  8 AFH14-133  27 SEPTEMBER 2017 Analysis  and  Production,  Dissemination  and  Integration,  and  Evaluation  and  Feedback (PCPAD), as Item 2 of Figure 1.1 illustrates. 1.3.3.  Item 3 in Figure 1.1 indicates that AF intelligence analysis is nested within the larger AF  ISR  Enterprise,  a  Total  Force  construct  extending  from  squadron  to  headquarters  level and ranging from tactical to strategic focus. 1.3.4.  As  depicted  in  Item  4  of  Figure  1.1,  analyst  Airmen  and  the  AF  ISR  Enterprise  are mutually  supporting;  unified  in  policy,  authorities,  tenets,  and  strategy;  and  skilled  in employing tools that enable AF, joint, and IC operations. 1.3.5.  Analyst  Airmen  are  trained  in  the  art  and  science  of  analytical  tradecraft  and  apply common tenets and standards across the full range of military operations, from major theater warfare to humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, as depicted in Item 5 of Figure 1.1. 1.3.6.  To  support  these  operations,  analyst  Airmen  engage  in  various  types  of  analysis, ranging from fusion analysis to all-source analysis (ASA), as shown in Item 6 of Figure 1.1.  Fusion  analysis  entails  quickly  melding  new  information  with  already  established  baseline knowledge  to  meet  specific  operational  needs.    Comprehensive  ASA  is  often  less  time sensitive and more focused on studying and understanding long-term trends and maintaining a depth  of knowledge on a  given subject.    Each organization within the  AF  ISR Enterprise conducts  analysis  across  this  continuum  -  at  varying  levels  based  on  key  intelligence questions  and  customer  requirements  -  to  fill  a  gap  in  knowledge,  or  a  need  to  improve understanding of the threat environment and/or adversary capabilities. 1.3.7.  Common  analysis  activities  performed  across  the  AF  ISR  enterprise  include Discovery,  Assessment,  Explanation,  Anticipation,  and  Delivery,  which  operate  in  parallel with  the  PCPAD  process,  as  depicted  in  Item  7  of  Figure  1.1.    Analyst  Airmen  identify relevant  information  in  support  of  ongoing  operations  and  requirements,  classify  and categorize information, and create estimates of capabilities and impacts. 1.3.8.  As Item 8 of Figure 1.1 indicates, the derived knowledge is used to create descriptions in  greater  context  to  provide  indications  and  warning  regarding  a  specific  problem  set.  Intelligence  products  and  services  are  developed,  tailored,  and  presented  according  to  key intelligence questions or customer requirements. 1.3.9.  As  shown  in  Item  9  of  Figure  1.1,  the  AF  intelligence  analysis  concept  and  the  AF ISR Enterprise are interconnected by both a net-centric architecture and analytic toolsets that ensure  critical  interface  among  AF  operational  elements,  Joint,  and  IC  analysts,  thereby ensuring access to all relevant data in a geographically-enabled and integrated manner. AFH14-133  27 SEPTEMBER 2017 9 Chapter 2 AF INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS ENTERPRISE 2.1.  Analyst  Airmen.  An  analyst  Airman  is  an  AF  ISR  professional  who  is  skilled  and qualified  in  tradecraft  to  perform  the  core  competency  of  intelligence  analysis  across  the  air, space,  or  cyberspace  domains.    Certification  criteria  and  programs  vary  based  on  unit  and mission  requirements.    Analyst  Airmen  are  bound  by  the  professional  standards  for  analysis established  by  the  IC,  and  supplemented  by  AF  standards  and  mission  qualifications  of  the assigned ISR unit.  Whether ISR professionals are analyst Airmen depends more on what they do than where they sit. 2.2.  AF  Intelligence  Analysis  Enterprise  (AFIAE)  .    The  enterprise  is  defined  as  the  global community of analyst Airmen and the AF ISR organizations that employ the core competency of intelligence  analysis.    Figure  2.1,  AFIAE,  depicts  how  the  AFIAE,  intelligence  analysis,  and analysis fundamentals fit within the larger AF ISR Enterprise.  Refer to Chapter 4 for a detailed explanation of analysis fundamentals.  Although not shown in Figure 2.1, the AF ISR Enterprise resides within the IC Enterprise.  As a member of the IC, the AF contributes to IC analysis and production and also receives analysis and production support from other IC organizations. Figure 2.1.  AFIAE.  10 AFH14-133  27 SEPTEMBER 2017 2.3.  Analysis Spectrum  .  Analyst Airmen employ fundamental tenets, standards, and activities to  perform analysis across  a broad continuum  for mission accomplishment.   On one end of the analysis  continuum  are  fusion  and  single-source  analysis,  with  emphasis  on  timeliness  over completeness.  On the other end of the spectrum is comprehensive ASA, with less emphasis on rapidity,  and  greater  emphasis  on  analytic  content,  depth,  trends,  technical,  and  other  subject-matter expertise.  This spectrum is depicted in Figure 2.2, AF Spectrum of Intelligence Analysis. 2.3.1.  Single-Source Analysis (also called Exploitation).  Intelligence analysis that employs a  single  source  or  expertise  in  a  functional  area  to  characterize  events,  people,  or  things.  Such analysis is limited to describing, rather than evaluating, the topic of a particular analysis due to  restrictions inherent  in  single-source intelligence  collection, precluding the  ability to provide fully contextualized intelligence assessments. 2.3.2.  Fusion Analysis.   Analysis in  a time-sensitive environment  in  close proximity to the point of collection that entails quickly melding new information with baseline knowledge to meet a specific operational need.  Note:  Proximity does not refer to physical or geographic location but rather functional proximity to the collection step in the intelligence process (for example,  a  Distributed  Common  Ground  System  (DCGS)  Analysis  and  Reporting  Team (DART)  at  Beale  AFB  may  conduct  fusion  analysis  of  an  operational  area  on  the  opposite side  of  the  globe).    Emphasis  is  on  the  process  of  managing  information  and  on  timeliness over completeness.   Fusion analysis generally has three components:  1) it usually includes more  than  one  source;  2)  it  is  time  critical;  and  3)  it  is  performed  to  meet  a  commander’s requirements or specific operational need. 2.3.3.  Multi-Source  Analysis  (also  called  Multi-Intelligence  (INT)  Analysis).    Intelligence analysis that makes use of more than one source when access to additional potential sources is limited by reasons of timeliness, system access, location, or security levels. 2.3.4.  All-Source  Analysis  (ASA).    Intelligence  analysis  that  employs  all  available  sources of data and information to enable the creation of new intelligence and knowledge. AFH14-133  27 SEPTEMBER 2017 11 Figure 2.2.  AF Spectrum of Intelligence Analysis.  2.3.5.  At the far left of the graphic, intelligence analysis units, such as AF DARTs, provide near-real-time  (NRT),  multi-source  fusion  analysis  closest  to  the  point  of  collection  to improve collection, perform dynamic targeting, and support tactical warfighters.  Moving to the  right  across  the  spectrum,  the  Air  Operations  Centers'  (AOCs)  ISR  Divisions  (ISRD), Joint Intelligence Operations Centers (JIOCs), and IC organizations provide multi-source and ASA with  fewer time constraints and in  close proximity to strategic-level  commanders  and decision-makers to facilitate battlespace awareness, operations planning and sustainment, and policy decisions.  Since the late 1990s, changes in technology, operational needs, and CCMD requirements  have  blurred  the  once  distinct  lines  of  this  analysis  spectrum.    Today  AFIAE organizations  have  evolved  to  delivery  across  the  spectrum  –  rather  than  delivering  within any single niche. 2.4.  Characteristics  of the AF Intelligence Analysis Enterprise (AFIAE). 2.4.1.  Layered.    Intelligence  analysis  capabilities  reside  at  multiple  levels  of  command—unit,  (squadron,  group,  wing),  Numbered  AF  (NAF),  MAJCOM,  and  AF-level.    Additional levels,  including  joint  and Department  of Defense (DoD),  exist beyond the AF.   Table 2.1, Layers  of  Analysis,  identifies  the  various  layers  of  analysis  organizations  along  with  their general  analytical  focus,  typical  customers,  and  timeliness,  as  modern  processes  and technologies  enable  organizations  to  extend  their  focus  and  timelines  outside  traditional norms.    While  representative,  this  table  is  not  a  complete  listing  of  all  AF  analysis organizations. 12 AFH14-133  27 SEPTEMBER 2017 Table 2.1.  Layers of Analysis.

Starting at the bottom of Table 2.1, unit-level intelligence organizations focus on tactical analysis needs (e.g., location, movement, and readiness of enemy forces) for their tactical-level  customers  in  the  AF  and  other  services.   Unit-level  intelligence organizations  typically  operate  under  short  timelines  from  real-time  or  NRT  to  several days out. 2.4.1.2.  DCGS  units  are  tactically  and  operationally  focused.    Within  each  DCGS  unit, the  DART  conducts  analysis  for  their  respective  CFACC  as  well  as  other  IC  and  DoD customers.  DARTs operate in a time sensitive environment but can support the customer up to the operational level of ISR planning.  Their main emphasis is fusion analysis. 2.4.1.3.  ISR wings provide both operational and tactical level intelligence analysis, with timelines  ranging  from  hours  to  months.    In  particular,  the  363  ISR  Wing  (ISRW)  is dedicated to providing all-source analysis and targeting intelligence to NAFs and below across the entire AF. AFH14-133  27 SEPTEMBER 2017 13 2.4.1.4.  NAF/A2s,  AF  Forces  (AFFOR)/A2,  and  AOC  ISRDs  are  operationally  and tactically  focused  in  support  of  their  associated  CCMD,  their  joint  task  force  (JTF), and/or their units.  Their typical timelines are hours to days. 2.4.1.5.  Intelligence  offices  within  Acquisition  Centers,  such  as  the  Space  and  Missile Systems  Center  (SMC),  AF  Life  Cycle  Management  Center  (AFLCMC)  and  AF Research  Laboratory  (AFRL),  provide  both  strategic  and  operational  intelligence  for acquisition  program  managers,  project  managers,  MAJCOMs,  and  AF/IC  leadership, with timelines that range from days to months. 2.4.1.6.  MAJCOM/A2s  provide  strategic  and  operational  analyses  for  their  MAJCOM staff  and  supported  units,  usually  ranging  from  days  to  months.    The  Air  Mobility Command (AMC)/A2 is unique in that its Air Intelligence Squadron (AIS) and the 204th Intelligence  Squadron  (ANG)  provide  direct  analytic  support  to  18  AF  and  subordinate units  in  the  conduct  of  their  rapid  global  mobility  missions.    Additionally,  U.S.  Air Forces  in  Europe  &  Air  Forces  Africa  (USAFE-AFAFRICA)  and  Pacific  Air  Forces (PACAF)  are  unique  as  Component  MAJCOMs  (C-MAJCOMs)  in  that  they  have  the responsibility of analytically representing the Joint Force Air Component Commander to the Joint Force Commander. 2.4.1.7.  The  National  Air  and  Space  Intelligence  Center  (NASIC)  conducts  strategic, operational, and tactical analysis for a broad range of customers in the AF, DoD, and IC as  well  as  and  including  national  leadership  and  the  acquisition  community.    Their timelines  extend  from  short-term  to  long-term,  depending  on  the  customer’s  needs.  Whereas the 363 ISRW is the primary AF organization that conducts tactical intelligence analysis, NASIC is the primary AF organization focused on strategic intelligence.  Both the 363  ISRW and NASIC provide significant  analysis at  the operational  level,  as well.  Further,  while  other  AF  layers  conduct  analysis  as  part  of  their  mission,  analysis  is  a primary mission of the 363 ISRW and NASIC. 2.4.1.8.  Joint  intelligence  organizations  at  CCMDs  and  JTFs  conduct  strategic  and operational  analysis  in  support  of  their  respective  regional  and  functional  commands.  The timelines of their analysis range from days to months. 2.4.1.9.  Combat  Support  Agencies  (CSAs)  focus  primarily  on  strategic  analysis  for national leadership, DoD, and the IC.  Although they usually operate on timelines ranging from  days  to  months,  they  also  provide  real-time  and  near-real-time  analysis  as requirements dictate. 2.4.2.  Distributed  and  Mutually  Supporting.    In  addition  to  being  layered,  analysis responsibilities are distributed across geographic regions and functional areas in the AF (see Figure  2.3,  Layered,  Distributed,  and  Mutually  Supporting  Nature  of  AFIAE).    Analysis organizations in every layer and every region/function are interconnected and have access to each other.  Organizations collaborate and share expertise to ensure the most accurate, timely analysis is provided to answer intelligence requirements.  The mutually supporting nature of the  AFIAE  includes  enterprise  partners,  such  as  the  AF  Office  of  Special  Investigations (AFOSI). 14 AFH14-133  27 SEPTEMBER 2017 Figure 2.3.  Layered, Distributed, and Mutually Supporting Nature of AFIAE.  AFH14-133  27 SEPTEMBER 2017 15 Chapter 3 THE NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS COMMUNITY AND THE AIR FORCE 3.1.  The  Intelligence  Community.  The  IC  is  a  coalition  of  17  agencies  and  organizations, including  the  Office  of  the  Director  of  National  Intelligence  (ODNI),  within  the  Executive Branch that work both independently and collaboratively to  gather and analyze the intelligence necessary to conduct foreign relations and national security activities.  See Attachment 6, Table A6.1, Members of the IC, for a complete list of IC organizations. 3.1.1.  The Director of National Intelligence (DNI) has overall responsibility for intelligence support to the President and the day-to-day management of the IC.  AF analysis falls under the governance and direction of the DNI.  The AF is an active participant in governance and oversight  forums  and  follows  the  analytical  priorities,  standards,  processes,  and  procedures established  by  the  IC.    The  DNI  issues  guidance  for  analysis  and  production  through  IC Directives (ICDs), IC Standards (ICSs), DNI memorandums, and other directive documents.  The IC documents that most often impact AF analysis are identified in Attachment 6, Table A6.2, Common IC and DoD Analysis References. 3.1.2.  DoD Intelligence. 3.1.2.1.  The Secretary of Defense (SecDef) is responsible for the DoD portion of the IC.  The  Under  Secretary  of  Defense  for  Intelligence  (USD(I))  serves  as  the  senior  defense intelligence,  counterintelligence,  and  security  official  below  the  SecDef  and  Deputy SecDef.  For defense intelligence analysis the USD(I): 3.1.2.1.1.  Provides  oversight  and  direction  for  analysis  capabilities  to  ensure effective support to the DoD mission. 3.1.2.1.2.  Ensures  analysis  is  aligned  with  IC  and  DoD  analytical  concepts, methodologies, and priorities. 3.1.2.1.3.  Establishes  DoD implementation of DoD all-source analysis plans, programs, and performance. analysis  policy all-source and  oversees the 3.1.2.1.4.  Provides  strategic  guidance  to  the  Defense  Intelligence  All-Source Analysis Enterprise (DIAAE), the collective set of all DoD organizations that execute all-source analysis activities in production of defense intelligence. 3.1.2.1.5.  Develops  and  maintains  the  consolidated  set  of  Defense  Intelligence priorities  that  guides  DIAAE  analysis  and  reflects  the  intelligence  needs  of  all Defense Intelligence consumers. 3.1.2.1.6.  Establishes the  DIAAE  Board  of  Governors  (BOG),  a  body  of representatives  from  the  DIAAE  organizations  that  provides  a  forum  for  addressing issues,  improving  transparency,  implementing  strategies,  and  making  resource recommendations across the DIAAE. 3.1.2.2.  The  AF  participates  in  the  DIAAE  BOG  and  other  DoD  analysis  forums  and adheres  to  DoD  analysis-related  policies.    Within  the  DoD,  the  agency  with  the  largest responsibility for promulgating ASA guidance is the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA).  16 AFH14-133  27 SEPTEMBER 2017 DIA governs ASA responsibilities, policies, priorities, and relationships across the DoD IAW  DoD  Instruction  (DoDI)  3115.17  and  as  the  DoD  Functional  Manager  for  ASA.  Additionally, DIA manages the Defense Intelligence Analysis Program (DIAP), with the primary  goal  of  maximizing  enterprise  efficiencies  through  clearly  defined  ASA  and production responsibilities among DIA, CCMDs, and service intelligence centers. intelligence,  human 3.1.2.3.  In addition to ASA and production conducted within the DIAP, the AF conducts single-source  analysis,  e.g.,  signals intelligence,  geospatial intelligence,  etc.,  that  is  additionally  governed  by  directives  established  by  respective lead DoD agencies.  AF production that supports these single-source disciplines adheres to  AF  guidance  as  well  as  standards  set  forth  by  the  respective  DoD  lead  agencies.  Further, the DoD has established overarching policy related to acquisition intelligence, to which the AF adheres.  If a conflict arises between the AF and  IC agency guidance, IC guidance  takes  precedence.    See  Attachment  6,  Table  A6.2,  Common  IC  and  DoD Analysis References, for a list of common DoD analysis-related documents. 3.1.3.  Military  Services.    Each  military  service  has  a  senior  intelligence  officer  (SIO)  that oversees intelligence policy, planning, programming, and activities on behalf of the service chief.  The AF SIO is the Deputy Chief of Staff (DCS) for ISR, also known as the AF/A2.  Each service is authorized one service intelligence center, also called an intelligence analysis center.  The AF’s service intelligence center is NASIC.  The AF has assigned the Air Combat Command (ACC) as its lead MAJCOM for the GIISR capability, which includes intelligence analysis.  Similarly, other military services have assigned significant analysis responsibilities to  various  organizations.    All  services  routinely  reach  out  to  each  other  for  service-unique expertise  and  collaboration  in  addressing  analysis  requirements.    Refer  to  Attachment  6, Table  A6,  Major  Intelligence  Analysis  Entities  of  the  Military  Services,  and  Table  A6.4, Common Analysis Organizations, for a breakdown of the major intelligence analysis entities in  each  military  service  and  a  list  of  service  and  other  government  agencies  organized according to the primary analysis they conduct. 3.2.  Intelligence  Analysis  and  the  Joint  Intelligence  Process.  As  highlighted  in  Joint Publication (JP) 2-0, Joint Intelligence, the intelligence process is comprised of six interrelated categories,  collectively  referred  to  as  PCPAD.    Refer  to  Figure  3.1,  Joint  Intelligence  Process, for  a  graphic  depiction  of  the  PCPAD  cycle.    The  PCPAD  process  is  universally  recognized throughout the IC and linked to the DoD Joint Capability Area (JCA) of Battlespace Awareness.  JCAs  provide  a  common  framework  for  defining  needs,  analyzing  operational  gaps,  and conducting planning and, by extension, programming for DoD capabilities. AFH14-133  27 SEPTEMBER 2017 17 Figure 3.1.  Joint Intelligence Process.  3.2.1.  Planning  and  Direction  is  dependent  on  the  ability  to  synchronize  and  integrate  the activities of collection, processing, exploitation, analysis and dissemination resources to meet Battlespace Awareness information requirements.  Planning and direction activities include, but  are not  limited to:  the identification and prioritization of intelligence requirements; the development of concepts of intelligence operations and architectures required to support the commander’s  mission;  tasking  subordinate  intelligence  elements  for  the  collection  of information  or  the  production  of  finished  intelligence;  submitting  requests  for  additional capabilities  to  higher  headquarters;  and  submitting  requests  for  collection,  exploitation,  or all-source  production  support  to  external,  supporting  intelligence  entities.    Planning  and direction occurs continuously and allows for the prioritization of intelligence support across all ongoing operations and simultaneous planning efforts. 3.2.2.  Collection  is  the  ability  to  gather  data  and  obtain  required  information  to  satisfy requirements.    Collection  is  managed  by  collection  managers,  whose  duties  include identifying  the  most  appropriate  available  assets  and  then  tasking  those  assets  to  conduct collection  missions.    Collection  managers  also  develop  and  coordinate  sensor  employment guidance,  exercise  authoritative  control  of  specific  collection  operations,  revise  collection activities  as  required,  monitor  the  overall  satisfaction  of  requirements,  and  assess  the effectiveness of the collection plan to satisfy the original and evolving intelligence need. 3.2.3.  Processing and Exploitation involves the transformation of collected information into formats  suitable  for  further  analysis  and/or  action  by  man  or  machine.    During  processing and  exploitation,  raw  collected  data  are  converted  into  forms  that  can  be  readily  used  by commanders,  decision-makers  at  all  levels,  intelligence  analysts,  and  other  consumers.  Processing  and  exploitation  includes  first-phase  imagery  exploitation,  data  conversion  and correlation, document and media translation, and signal decryption, as well as reporting the results of these actions to analysis and production elements. 18 AFH14-133  27 SEPTEMBER 2017 3.2.4.  Analysis  and  Production  involves  the  integration,  evaluation,  and  interpretation  of information  obtained  from  available  sources  to  develop  intelligence  and  forecast  the  future state  to  enable  situational  awareness  and  provide  new  knowledge/actionable  information.  The AF has identified five activities that occur within this category of the PCPAD process:  Discovery,  Assessment,  Explanation,  Anticipation,  and  Delivery.    See  Chapter  4  for  a description of each, along with an explanation or how it relates to broader AF ISR activities, and the tenets and standards to which analyst Airmen adhere in order to carry out these five analysis activities. 3.2.5.  Dissemination  and  Integration  focuses  on  the  ability  to  present,  distribute,  or  make available  to  military  and  national  decision-makers  the  intelligence,  information  and environmental  content  and  products  that  enable  understanding  of  the  operational/physical   Personal,  networked,  and  database  data  transfers  are  all  means  of environment.   The  diversity  of  dissemination  paths  requires  a  high  degree  of dissemination. communications  and  system joint  and  multinational  forces, component commands, DoD organizations, and the interagency community. interoperability  among 3.2.6.  Evaluation  and  Feedback  occur  continuously  throughout  the  intelligence  process.    It requires  a  collaborative  dialogue  among  intelligence  planners,  collection  managers, collectors, analysts, intelligence systems architects, and customers.  The intent of evaluation and feedback is  to  identify  potential problems  as early  as possible to  minimize information gaps and mitigate capability shortfalls. 3.2.7.  Although “analysis” is specifically identified in the Analysis and Production category of PCPAD, most intelligence analysts agree that analysis takes place in all categories of the joint intelligence process. 3.3.  IC Funding.  The National Intelligence Program (NIP), administered by the DNI, provides guidance and funding for a broad range of ISR activities within the IC.  NIP is divided into sub-programs,  including  the  General  Defense  Intelligence  Program  (GDIP)  for  ASA  and  other specific  intelligence  activities,  the  Consolidated  Cryptologic  Program  (CCP)  for  signals intelligence  activities,  and  the  National  Geospatial-Intelligence  Program  (NGP)  for  geospatial intelligence  activities.    Some  AF  intelligence  organizations  receive  funding  through  these  NIP sources  for  certain  single-source  and  ASA  missions  and  are  required  to  adhere  to  the  analysis and production guidelines and standards associated with the funding.  However, the majority of AF  analysis  activities,  particularly  at  and  below  wing  level,  are  funded  through  the  Military Intelligence  Program  (MIP)  for  mission  execution.    For  details,  refer  to  ICD  104,  National Intelligence Program (NIP) Budget Formulation and Justification, Execution, and Performance Evaluation and DoDD 5205.12, Military Intelligence Program (MIP). 3.4.  Quality  Analysis  Programs  .    The  IC  and  AF  offer  a  variety  of  analyst  enrichment opportunities  to  broaden  and  deepen  an  analyst's  experience  and  expertise.    Some  examples include  the  AF  Quality  of  Analysis  Program,  DNI  Quality  of  Analysis  Program,  National Intelligence  University,  DIA's  Intelligence  Community  Advanced  Analytical  Program,  and  the AF Institute of Technology. 3.5.  AF  National  Tactical  Integration  (AF  NTI)  .    The  AF  NTI  program  integrates  U.S. Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) System resources with theater air and space components to ensure seamless  support.    The  AF  NTI  team  shifts  the  focus  of  national  SIGINT  performance  from discovering and reporting data to collaboratively generating actionable intelligence for the Joint AFH14-133  27 SEPTEMBER 2017 19 Force  Air  Component  Commander.    The  AF  NTI  team  capitalizes  on  data  acquisition capabilities, existing databases and datalinks of multiple national SIGINT sources, and access to AF  analysts  in  the  AOC,  National  Cryptologic  Centers,  and  AF  intelligence  production organizations  (e.g.,  NASIC).    While  the  program  remains  predominately  SIGINT  focused,  the AF NTI enterprise also  has the ability to  leverage all AF  ISR capabilities.   Note:   Refer to  AF ISR  Agency  Instruction  (AFISRAI)  14-153  Volume  3,  480  ISRW  Supplement,  Air  Force Distributed Common Ground System (AF DCGS) Operations Procedures. 20 AFH14-133  27 SEPTEMBER 2017 Chapter 4 ANALYSIS FUNDAMENTALS–ACTIVITIES, TENETS, & STANDARDS 4.1.  AF  ISR  Capabilities  .    The  AF  GIISR  Core  Function  Concept  highlights  five  enduring core capabilities (refer to Figure 4.1, Enduring GIISR Capabilities) that directly support the JCA of  Battlespace  Awareness.    As  previously  mentioned,  this  JCA  delineation  is  key  for  defining analysis-specific needs, analyzing gaps, and for planning and programming against AF analytic requirements.  Similar to the joint PCPAD intelligence process discussed in Chapter 3, analysis is an essential and integral component of each of the five enduring GIISR capabilities. Figure 4.1.  Enduring GIISR Capabilities. 4.2.  AF Intelligence Analysis Activities  .  As depicted in Figure 4.2, AF Intelligence Analysis Activities,  analyst  Airmen  commonly  perform  five  activities  in  support  of  the  GIISR  enduring capabilities mentioned above.  AFH14-133  27 SEPTEMBER 2017 21 Figure 4.2.  AF Intelligence Analysis Activities.  4.2.1.  Discovery  is  the  ability  to  research,  select,  manipulate,  and  correlate  data  from multiple  sources  to  identify  information  relevant  to  ongoing  operations  and  requirements.  Discovery is about researching, better organizing, and using the data we already possess; it is also about finding previously hidden patterns and anomalies. 4.2.2.  Assessment  is  the  ability  to  provide  focused  examination  of  data  and  information about  an  object  or  an  event,  to  classify  and  categorize  it,  and  to  assess  its  reliability  and credibility  in  order  to  create  estimates  of  capabilities  and  impacts.    Assessment  is  how intelligence determines what our consumers ought to be concerned with. 4.2.3.  Explanation  is  the  ability  to  examine  events  and  derive  knowledge  and  insight  from the  interrelated  data  in  order  to  create  descriptions  and  propose  significance  in  greater context.    Explanation  is  how  intelligence  provides  consumers  with  narrative  stories,  relates events to broader situations, and identifies the core of “what is going on.” 4.2.4.  Anticipation is the ability to warn and describe future states of the environment based on the manipulation and synthesis of past and present data.  Anticipation includes near-term warning  and  longer-term  forecasting  to  alert  and  prepare  decision  makers  for  events  that could be relevant to their responsibilities. 4.2.5.  Delivery is the ability to develop, tailor, and present intelligence products and services according  to  customer  requirements  and  preferences.    Delivery  is  about  classic  intelligence products—from  tactical  reports  to  in-depth  intelligence  estimates—and  a  myriad  of intelligence  services,  ranging  from  interactive  displays  and  operational  pictures,  to multimedia  crew  threat  briefings  and  tablet-embedded,  dynamic  intelligence  assessments, enabling real-time analyst response to requests for information.  Delivery is often referred to as production and/or dissemination. 4.2.6.  As  Figure  4.3,  AF  Intelligence  Analysis  Continuum,  depicts,  analysis  activities  take place  across  a  continuum  within  the  AF,  starting  with  the  development  of  requirements; 22 AFH14-133  27 SEPTEMBER 2017 progressing  through  data  collection,  information  discovery,  and  intelligence  understanding; and  culminating  in  services  and  products  that  impact  commanders’  decisions  and  military actions. Figure 4.3.  AF Intelligence Analysis Continuum.  4.3.  AF Intelligence  Analysis  Tenets.  AF tenets of analysis derive from and support IC, joint intelligence, and broader ISR principles, while simultaneously emphasizing analysis attributes of particular  interest  and  priority  within  the  AF.    These  are  the  overarching  principles  held  to  be true  and  in  common  by  AF  ISR  professionals.    Collectively,  these  six  tenets  cover  the  most important beliefs about AF intelligence analysis.  According to AFI 14-133, while effort should be  taken  to  apply  all  of  these  tenets,  situations  may  dictate  not  all  of  them  being  used.    The following descriptions are excerpts from AFI 14-133. 4.3.1.  Objectivity.  Analysis should be based on fact and be clear and truthful about what is known  versus  what  is  judged.    It  should  not  be  distorted  by  emotion  or  personal  or organizational  bias  and  shall  be  independent  of  command  or  political  considerations.  Further,  it  should  clearly  delineate  underlying  intelligence,  assumptions,  and  judgments.  Analysts  should  address  alternative  perspectives  and  contrary  information  and  avoid  being unduly constrained by previous judgments. 4.3.2.  Integrity.  While closely linked to objectivity, integrity involves a broader focus on all activities, standards, and processes associated with  AF intelligence analysis.   Integrity  calls for complete honesty  and reliability in analysis combined with  firm  adherence to  a code of professional  ethics  and  tradecraft  standards  such  as  accuracy,  timeliness,  and  customer responsiveness.    Integrity  includes  explaining  changes  in  previous  analytic  judgments,  as well as addressing significant differences in judgment among various U.S. analytic elements.  AFH14-133  27 SEPTEMBER 2017 23 As stated in JP 2-0, integrity is “the cardinal  element in intelligence analysis and reporting, and the foundation on which credibility with the intelligence consumer is built.” 4.3.3.  Synthesis.    AF  intelligence  analysis  requires  analysts  to  use  all  available  sources  of information to maximize completeness.  Analysts should also identify information gaps and, where  they  exist,  they  should  coordinate  with  collectors  to  develop  access  and  collection strategies.    Synthesis  requires  well-honed  tradecraft  skills,  including  critical  thinking, alternative  analysis,  and  the  ability  to  take  the  perspective  of  the  adversary.    Compatible, service-oriented  information  technology  architectures  and  tools  are  also  key  to  facilitating synthesis. 4.3.4.  Collaboration.    Analysts  must  actively  solicit  opinions  and  assessments  from  other analysts  and  seek  to  share  ideas.    Data,  information,  and  intelligence  must  be  broadly accessed  and  shared.    Collaboration  should  take  place  internally  within  the  AFIAE,  across the IC, and with allies, academia, and other entities outside the IC, when feasible.  Effective collaboration facilitates maximum synthesis. 4.3.5.  Anticipation.    Analysis  is  far  more  than  trend  assessment;  its  true  value  resides  in warning  and  forecasting  to  be  relevant  to  decision  making,  warfighting,  operations,  and acquisition.    Because  information  gaps  routinely  limit  our  ability  to  predict  with  complete accuracy,  it  is  incumbent  on  analysts  to  effectively  apply  tradecraft  standards  such  as alternative  analysis,  levels  of  confidence,  assumptions  vs.  judgments,  and  appropriate sourcing.    Intelligence  warning  and  forecasting  are  not  exact;  however,  analysts  should utilize the most recent data/information for all warning or forecast-related analysis. 4.3.6.  Requirements.    The  AF  intelligence  analysis  mission  is  motivated  by  continuous engagement  with customers to  comprehend dynamic needs.  Customer  requirements can be solicited from a variety of sources such as:  understanding their operations; holding working groups  or  technical  exchanges  with  them;  anticipating  and  listening  to  their  questions; responding  to  feedback;  and  addressing  documented  need  statements  and  derivative  data needs.    Effectively  meeting  analysis  mission  requirements  demands  an  effective  balance  of customer familiarity, interpreted needs, collaboration, and analytical judgment. 4.4.  AF Standards of Intelligence Analysis  .  The AF has established ten standards by which it measures and assesses analytic excellence and readiness.  AF tradecraft standards align with IC standards;  however,  the  AF  incorporates  two  additional  attributes:    timeliness  and  customer engagement.    AF  standards  also  are  in  parallel  with    joint  intelligence  and  GIISR  guidance.  These  standards  are  used  by  the  AF  ISR  Enterprise  to  conduct  analysis  operations  and  are integrated into AF Inspection System criteria.  Attachment 4 contains a sample methodology and form  to  evaluate  these  standards.    The  following  descriptions  are  excerpts  from  AFI  14-133.  Refer to the AFI for additional details. 4.4.1.  Timeliness.    Analysis  must  be  timely  to  impact  planning,  mission  objectives, operations  and  otherwise  aid  in  commanders'  decisions.    The  aim  is  to  deliver  information and  knowledge  at  the  earliest  time  and  place  to  enable  customers  to  effectively  make decisions and take action. 4.4.2.  Appropriate Sourcing.  Analysis cites all sources used, when feasible, and includes an objective assessment of the quality, credibility, and reliability of the underlying sources. 24 AFH14-133  27 SEPTEMBER 2017 4.4.3.  Accuracy.  Analysis will make the most accurate judgments and assessments possible, based on the intelligence available and in light of known information gaps.  A retrospective assessment  of  the  accuracy  of  a  judgment  will  help  identify  biases  and  other  potential tradecraft errors for correction in future analysis. 4.4.4.  Level  of Confidence.  To help  qualify  accuracy  and to  present  analysis in  a uniform the  degree  of and  consistent  manner  across confidence/certainty associated with  analytic judgments and conclusions to the best of their ability, given currently available intelligence.  AFI 14-133, Table 3.1, Confidence Levels in Analytic  Judgment,  provides  guidance  for  analysts  to  use  in  assigning  levels  of confidence/certainty. the  AF,  analysts  will indicate 4.4.5.  Assumptions  vs.  Judgments.    Analysis  clearly  distinguishes  among  underlying intelligence, analyst assumptions, and analyst judgments. 4.4.6.  Alternative  Analysis.    Analysis  will  incorporate  plausible  alternative  assessments, judgments,  or  hypotheses,  particularly  when  major  judgments  contend  with  significant uncertainties, complexity, or a lack of available intelligence, or when low probability events could produce high impact results.  Whenever possible, analysis should be vetted through at least one other intelligence professional to minimize individual analyst bias. 4.4.7.  Relevance.    Analysis  is  key  to  decision  making,  warfighting,  and  acquisition  efforts.  Analysts  should  make  every  effort  to  ensure  products  and  services  fulfill  the  customer’s intent  and request,  while also  ensuring products  and services are available to  others for use beyond the original intent. 4.4.8.  Logical  Argumentation.    Analysis  will  employ  coherent  and  logical  reasoning techniques, be supported by all key relevant information, and be internally consistent. 4.4.9.  Utility.    AF  analytic  products  and  services  will  use  formats  (written,  verbal,  visual, etc.)  that  best  enable  understanding  by  the  customer.    Intelligence  analysis  will  be disseminated at the lowest classification and widest releasability levels without jeopardizing its usefulness to the customer. 4.4.10.  Customer Engagement.  Analysis should fully address customer requirements within time  constraints  and  in  a  manner  most  useful.    Analyst  Airmen  will  be  responsive  to customer feedback.  While challenging to evaluate, this tradecraft standard is foundational to AF intelligence analysis. 4.5.  Beyond  the  Checklist  .    The  list  of  analysis  activities,  tenets,  and  standards  lend themselves  to  a  checklist  mentality.    This  is  especially  true  with  the  standards,  that  are  the criteria  by  which  the  AF  evaluates  analytical  readiness.    However,  it  is  vital  to  remember  that intelligence  analysis is  not  just  a  science  but  also  an  art.  Following good tradecraft practices aids  in  developing  a  sound  analytic  process  and  foundation.    However,  the  analyst  cannot become  paralyzed  in  making  an  assessment  if  all  the  tradecraft  pieces  do  not  fully  align.  Mistakes will be made – have been made – but we cannot fail to provide decision makers with our best assessment based on what information we had at the time.  The analyst Airman learns the fundamentals but then spends many hours of intense effort honing and refining application of the  fundamentals  in  the  determined  pursuit  of  excellence.    Analysts  need  to  express  interest  in the analysis activities and be eager to  revisit  any or all of them for the sake of providing more accurate, mission-relevant analysis for each customer requirement.  Analysts need to embrace the AFH14-133  27 SEPTEMBER 2017 25 tenets  and  standards  such  that  they  become  an  intuitive  and  natural  part  of  all  analytical activities.    Analysts,  supervisors,  and  commanders  also  need  to  hold  each  other  accountable  to the tenets and standards. 4.6.  AF  Analytic Ombuds  .  The AF Analytic Ombuds is the AF representative that responds to concerns raised by intelligence analysts about adherence to AF analysis tenets, standards, and production  guidelines.    The  Ombuds  addresses  such  concerns  as  lack  of  objectivity,  bias, politicization, or other issues in applying analysis tenets and standards.  The AF/A2 appoints the AF  Analytic  Ombuds  in  accordance  with  DNI  guidance.    In  addition,  NASIC  and  each MAJCOM/A2 designate an individual or office to serve as their organization’s Analytic Ombuds IAW AFI 14-133. 26 AFH14-133  27 SEPTEMBER 2017 Chapter 5 ANALYSIS SKILLS AND TRADECRAFT 5.1.  Overview.  Intelligence  analysis  is  what  transforms  data  into  the  information  and knowledge necessary for warfighters and decision makers to decide and act (refer to Figure 5.1, Transforming Data to Decisions).  While technology can assist and enable these transformations of  data,  without  human  cognition  (people  “in-the-loop”)  it  is  doomed  to  fail.    There  are  things technology alone is not capable of.  The things technology can do depend upon human analysts creating and updating the analytic models, databases, and displays that can be automated or made more efficient.  The most basic and necessary unit in intelligence analysis is the analyst.  Note:  Attachment  7  identifies  some  online  resources  that  contain  additional  information  on  analysis skills and tradecraft topics covered in this chapter. Figure 5.1.  Transforming Data to Decisions.  5.1.1.  Definitions  and  Relationships.    An  analysis  skill  is  a  specific  ability  or  collection  of capabilities required to competently conduct analysis that is acquired through training and/or experience.   Analysis tradecraft is  an  established  or prescribed  analysis technique, practice, or systematic process.  The relationship and role of intelligence analysis skills and tradecraft is  illustrated  in  Figure  5.2,  Relationship  and  Role  of  Intelligence  Analysis  Skills  and Tradecraft.    Whereas  the  five  AF  intelligence  analysis  activities  (discovery,  assessment, explanation,  anticipation,  and  delivery)  comprise  “what”  analyst  Airmen  do  and  analysis tenets/standards  establish  how  well  analysis  is  done,  analysis  skills  and  tradecraft  are  the “how” of analysis.  Analysis activities, tenets, and standards drive the skills and tradecraft for which  analyst  Airmen  need  to  be  trained.    In  turn,  analysis  skills  and  tradecraft  determine training, evaluation, and certification requirements.  Analyst skills and tradecraft highlighted AFH14-133  27 SEPTEMBER 2017 27 in  this  publication  are  time-tested,  repeatable,  and  proven  effective  for  structured  AF intelligence analysis. Figure 5.2.  Relationship and Role of Intelligence Analysis Skills and Tradecraft.  5.1.2.  Analysis Transformation. 5.1.2.1.  In 2004, Congress passed the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act (IRTPA) in response to several commissions and hearings in the aftermath of 9/11.  That act is known for establishing the ODNI; however, the act also set forth a number of tasks and objectives for the DNI to accomplish to improve intelligence and prevent or mitigate the  failures  that  led  to  9/11.    It  is  worth  highlighting  that  a  majority  of  those  tasks  and objectives  relate  to  the  conduct  of  intelligence  analysis:    Congress  directed  that  U.S. intelligence analysis needed to be professionalized, have set standards, and address many shortcomings  in  skills  and  tradecraft  through  increased  guidance  and  training.    Thomas Fingar,  the  first  Deputy  DNI  for  Analysis,  later  reflected  that  up  until  IRTPA  and  the subsequent  transformation of analysis in  the  IC,  analysis had largely been a craft in  the IC:    skills  learned  only  on-the-job,  under  the  tutelage  of  ‘journeymen’  and  ‘masters,’ 28 AFH14-133  27 SEPTEMBER 2017 where the language and processes used could differ from shop to shop, region to region, and  advancement  was  informally  recognized  and  locally  derived.    Note:    For  more information  on  this  topic,  see  Thomas  Fingar,  Reducing  Uncertainty:    Intelligence Analysis and National Security. 5.1.2.2.  This  is  not  to  say  that  some  agencies  or  elements  in  the  IC  did  not  have  more established  vocabulary  and  tradecraft,  and  even  so-called  training  and  intelligence colleges, such as the CIA and DIA.  However, this kind of professional approach was not widespread, and where it was present, organizations were not sharing standards or efforts.  IC  standards  began  to  promulgate  through  DNI-approved  ICDs  and  other  policy,  while shared training and vocabulary were established through collaboration, development, and sharing of IC analysis training.  As these directives, policy, and training matured, efforts began  to  focus  on  defining  the  fundamentals  of  intelligence  analysis  as  a  means  to  true certification  of  all  analysts  in  the  IC.    Today,  these  analytic  standards  are  not  only reflected in ICDs, but are standards for AF compliance, as highlighted by AFI 14-133 and associated  unit  Management  Internal  Control  Toolset  (MICT)  Self-Assessment Communicators (SACs). 5.1.3.  Analysis Certification Programs. 5.1.3.1.  All-Source  Analysis  (ASA)  Certification  Program.    The  ASA  Certification Program is a USD(I)-approved and DIA-led analysis qualification program for the DoD.  The  program  assesses  a  candidate’s  knowledge  and  performance  of  ASA  skills.    The program is in the nascent stages.  Initial qualification is focused on the fundamentals of intelligence analysis and open to all military and civilian intelligence analysts.  The intent is for the program to expand to follow-on or higher levels of qualification.  The AF ISR Force  Management  Division  (AF/A2FD)  is  the  AF  OPR  for  the  ASA  Certification Program. 5.1.3.2.  Other Certification Programs.  The IC has also established certification programs for  various  fields  of  single-source  analysis  and  activities  closely  linked  with  ASA.    As one  example,  the  Geospatial  Intelligence  (GEOINT)  Certification  Program  is  part  of  a broader USD(I) initiative to further professionalize the DoD intelligence workforce.  The program  applies  to  all  cleared  DoD  civilian,  military,  and  contractor  practitioners  in GEOINT-related  work  roles.    Another  example  is  the  DoD  Collection  Management Certification  Program,  which  ensures  that  collection  managers  possess  the  knowledge and  skills  associated  with  the  competencies  necessary  to  successfully  carry  out  DoD collection management functional tasks. 5.2.  Skills  and  Tradecraft  Fundamentals.  While  analysis  skills  and  tradecraft  are  taught  in varying  forms  and  emphasis  across  the  IC  and  in  AF  entry  and  advanced  training  for  core  AF intelligence  AFSCs  (14N,  1NX,  9SX,  1A8X,  and  0132),  all  AF  intelligence  analysts  require competency  in  these  areas.    Figure  5.3,  Fundamental  Skills  and  Tradecraft  of  the  Analysis Process,  portrays  the  fundamental  skills  and  tradecraft  associated  with  the  analysis  process.  Although  the  figure  suggests  an  alignment,  the  order  in  which  the  analyst  Airman  applies  the skills  and tradecraft techniques varies depending  on the requirement and is  not  as important  as ensuring all skills and tradecraft are considered.  This section will describe each of these areas. AFH14-133  27 SEPTEMBER 2017 29 Figure 5.3.  Fundamental Skills and Tradecraft of the Analysis Process. 5.2.1.  Critical and Creative Thinking.  5.2.1.1.  Critical  thinking  is  considered  to  be  a  foundational  AF  analysis  skill.    AFI  14-133  defines  it  as  the  intellectually  disciplined  process  of  actively  and  skillfully conceptualizing,  applying,  analyzing,  synthesizing,  and/or  evaluating information gathered  from  or  generated  through  observation,  experience,  reflection,  reasoning,  or communication, as a guide to belief and action.  The concept of  critical thinking and its associated improvements to coherent cognition arose from the philosophy departments of schools and universities in the mid-1990s.  Many observers feel it was because managers and  leaders  across  the  private,  commercial,  and  government  worlds  began  demanding people  who  could  “think  better  and  deeper.”    Note:    See  Peter  A.  Facione,  Critical Thinking:  What It is and Why it Counts, p. 3.  Critical thinking may be better understood by  contrasting  it  with  “normal”  thinking.    In  everyday  thinking,  people  often  find themselves  with  a  central  thought  but  are  distracted  by  other  thoughts  or  topics  as  they occur either physically or mentally.  They strive to get to a destination, but may wander and stall before reaching it, with little recognition of where they have been.  In contrast, with  critical  thinking,  conscious  effort  occurs  to  focus  on  a  particular  thought  and additionally  be  “critical”  (the  origin  of  the  phrase)  or  reflective  and  purposeful,  using more  rigorous  reasoning.    Reflective  reasoning—thinking  about  how  we  think,  or metacognition—is the key difference between normal and critical thinking. 5.2.1.2.  The need for critical thinking in analysis is often paired with another adjective:  “creative.”    Creativity  has  always  been  difficult  to  define,  but  in  the  context  of intelligence analysis, the 9/11 Commission report abounds with calls for U.S. analysts to have more imagination:  to be able to link disparate happenings and facts, to see a “bigger picture,”  to  envision  alternatives  which  are  not  spelled  out.    In  rigorous  thinking, creativity  is  often  associated  with  “abductive”  reasoning:    the  process  of  generating  a novel  hypothesis  to  explain  given  evidence  that  does  not  readily  suggest  a  familiar 30 AFH14-133  27 SEPTEMBER 2017 explanation.  Note:  See section 5.2.4 for additional information on reasoning.  Creativity “characterizes the analyst’s ability to come to a conclusion spontaneously, often without a  sense  of  having  consciously  taken  definable  steps  to  get  there.    While  the  abduction process may not be easily defined or taught, it may be encouraged by providing analysts with a wide array of research material and experiences, and by supporting the expenditure of time and energy on creative thinking.”  Note:  See Lisa Krizan, Intelligence Essentials for  Everyone,  pp.  31-32,  and  LCDR  William  G.  Schmidlin,  Zen  and  the  Art  of Intelligence Analysis. 5.2.1.3.  Both  critical  and creative thinking  are supported in  intelligence  analysis by the application  of  methods  known  as  Structured  Analytic  Techniques  (SATs)  and  an understanding of analytic reasoning and the role of biases, addressed below. 5.2.2.  Framing  the  Intelligence  Question.    A  well-framed  intelligence  question  is  the  most important  factor  in  assuring  the  overall  quality  of  intelligence  analysis,  helping  analysts  to anticipate  emerging  trends  and  developments  and  focus  efforts  on  addressing  issues  most relevant  to  consumers  of  intelligence.    The  question  drives  information  discovery,  the selection of analytic approaches and methods, and ultimately the analytic message conveyed to intelligence consumers.  Successfully framing the intelligence question consists of clearly articulating the key intelligence issues and deconstructing the question to identify the primary factors to be considered in answering the question.  A well-framed question also requires the analyst  to  have  an  adequate  understanding  of  air/space/cyber  power  and  the  missions  the analyst  directly  supports.    Framing  the  question  includes  identifying  intelligence  gaps, understanding the information base, and knowing how to drive collection. 5.2.2.1.  Intelligence  Gaps.    An  intelligence  gap  is  information  that  is  needed  to appropriately conduct intelligence analysis and help answer an intelligence question but is  absent  from  reporting—what  we  know  we  don’t  know.    Identifying  gaps  helps  focus the  research  and  collection  required  to  close  the  gaps.    Moreover,  awareness  of intelligence  gaps  aids  analysts  in  properly  conveying  the  resulting  level  of  confidence associated with analytic judgments. 5.2.2.2.  Understanding the Information Base.  To effectively marshal information needed to  answer  intelligence  questions,  analysts  require  a  solid  understanding  of  the  available information base.  They need to identify what data and information is required, establish whether it is available, and determine where it can be found.  In addition, they know the strengths  and  weaknesses  of  potential  sources  of  information,  are  able  to  assess  the quality  of  that  information,  in  part  by  knowing  where  it  comes  from  and  how  it  was processed  and  disseminated,  and  understand  the  role  analysis  plays  in  transforming  this data and information into knowledge that provides value to intelligence consumers. 5.2.2.3.  Driving  Collection.    Analyst  Airmen  need  to  understand  how  information  is collected and processed in the AF and more broadly in the IC to identify which sources of information  are  most  useful  in  answering  their  intelligence  questions,  to  assess  quality and credibility, and to task collectors to collect information to fill intelligence gaps. 5.2.3.  Structured  Analytic  Techniques  (SATs).    After  properly  framing  the  intelligence question,  the  analyst  dives  into  the  heart  of  the  analysis  process.    There  are  several  critical skills  associated  with  this  core  research  and  analysis  phase  of  the  process,  one  being  the application of SATs. AFH14-133  27 SEPTEMBER 2017 31 5.2.3.1.  In Structured Analytic Techniques For Intelligence Analysis, Richards J. Heuer, Jr.  and  Randolf  H.  Pherson  describe  structured  analysis  as  “a  step-by-step  process  that externalizes an individual analyst’s thinking in a manner that makes it readily apparent to others,  thereby  enabling  it  to  be  shared,  built  on,  and  critiqued  by  others.    When combined  with  the  intuitive  judgment  of  subject  matter  experts,  such  a  structured  and transparent  process  can  significantly  reduce  the  risk  of  analytic  error.”    Note:    See Richards  J.  Heuer,  Jr.  and  Randolf  H.  Pherson,  Structured  Analytic  Techniques  For Intelligence Analysis, p. xvi.  SATs rose to prominence in intelligence analysis as part of a broad effort to  transform  the tradecraft following 9/11.   Most SATs are not  unique to intelligence analysis, but have been developed in other fields that utilize analysis.  Many of these techniques, shown in Figure 5.4, SATs, broadly fall under the field of operations research, management tools, and general decision-making aids. Figure 5.4.  SATs. 5.2.3.2.  Why are SATs important?  Their application helps the analyst take a systematic approach  to  problem  solving,  mitigate  bias  and  error,  and  enhance  analytic  credibility.  SATs  are  useful  by  both  individuals  and  teams  in  breaking  down  problems  or “decomposition,”  generating  ideas  or  “brainstorming,”  testing  ideas  or  reviewing alternatives,  and  checking  solutions  or  assessments.    Structured  techniques  offer  an effective  means  of  applying  scientific  methodologies  to  the  operational  art  of  analysis.   32 AFH14-133  27 SEPTEMBER 2017 Advanced  analytic  courses,  such  the  AF  Critical  Thinking  and  Structured  Analysis Course  (CTSAC),  offer  focused  training  on  SATs.    Attachment  5  contains  a  tradecraft guide that details some of the key SATs commonly used by analyst Airmen. 5.2.4.  Analytic Reasoning and Bias. 5.2.4.1.  The  heart  of  the  definition  for  critical  thinking  is  purposeful,  reflective reasoning.  Logical reasoning is defined as the process of establishing a justified belief by using  premises  (rules),  evidence  (facts),  and  argument  (relationships).    Three  types  of basic reasoning include: 5.2.4.1.1.  Deductive  reasoning—Sometimes  called  deductive  logic,  deduction  is reasoning in which a conclusion is a logical consequence of the premise.  A deduction moves from general rules and some evidence to particular cases. 5.2.4.1.2.  Inductive  reasoning—The  intellectual  process  of  drawing  generalizations on the basis of observations or other evidence.  Induction takes place when one learns from experience. 5.2.4.1.3.  Abductive  reasoning—The  process  of  generating  a  novel  hypothesis  to explain  given  evidence  that  does  not  readily  suggest  a  familiar  explanation.  Abductive reasoning starts from a set of accepted facts and creatively proposes their best explanation. 5.2.4.2.  More recently, social scientists have helped to expand the horizons and suggest there  are  analytical  modes  of  reasoning,  most  of  which  are  familiar  in  description  yet have significant research behind them.  Reasoning is the process of forming conclusions, judgments, facts, opinions, or inferences.  Reasoning assists in forming arguments based upon evidence about observed activities.  It is the job of an analyst Airmen to make sense of a complicated mass of information—to understand and explain the current situation, to reconstruct the past that led to it, and to use it as the basis of predictions for the future.  Note:    See  Barbara  Spellman,  “Individual  Reasoning”  in  Intelligence  Analysis:  Behavioral and Social Scientific Foundations, p. 117.  As human beings with developed intellects, we generally may be said to have six modes of reasoning: 5.2.4.2.1.  Status Quo—Making immediate judgments and inferences. 5.2.4.2.2.  Authoritative—Drawing inferences from expert testimony or strong belief. 5.2.4.2.3.  Comparative—Drawing conclusions from examples, cases, or analogies. 5.2.4.2.4.  Empirical—Drawing  conclusions  from  personal  interaction  with  real evidence. 5.2.4.2.5.  Scientific—Drawing casual inferences using facts, premises, and logic. 5.2.4.2.6.  Market—Drawing conclusions from a structured consensus of persons. 5.2.4.3.  We  use  many  of  these  modes  of  reasoning  every  day,  and  there  are  analytical equivalents used in the process and mission of intelligence.  However, bias remains one of the most common detractors in applying the modes of reasoning.  Cognitive biases are mental  errors caused by  our simplified information  processing strategies.  When people reason, they employ various simplifying strategies and rules of thumb to ease the burden of  mentally  processing  information  to  make  judgments  and  decisions.    “I  always  get AFH14-133  27 SEPTEMBER 2017 33 enchiladas at Mexican restaurants; the interstate is always faster; or I always get my news from  an  online  news  source.”    These  simple  rules  of  thumb  may  be  acceptable  for surviving the daily grind, but not for performing intelligence analysis.  Analysts have to remain detached from normal survival biases and start fresh with each new problem. 5.2.4.4.  Common types of cognitive biases include: 5.2.4.4.1.  Bandwagon  Effect—Tendency  to  believe  something  because  many  others believe it. 5.2.4.4.2.  Clustering Illusion—Tendency to overvalue small runs, streaks, or clusters in large sets of data. 5.2.4.4.3.  Confirmation  Bias—Tendency assumptions or expectations, and undervalue that which contradict. to  overvalue  data  supporting initial 5.2.4.4.4.  Framing  Effect—Tendency  to  draw  different  conclusions  from  the  same data if it is presented differently. 5.2.4.4.5.  Illusory  Correlation—Belief  that  two  events  are  related  when  they  might not be. 5.2.4.4.6.  Insensitivity  to  Sample  Size—Tendency  to  underestimate  the  variation  in data from small samples. 5.2.4.4.7.  Mirror Imaging— Assumption that others see events and react to them just as we do. 5.2.5.  Data Organization, Visualization, and Analytic Modeling. 5.2.5.1.  As  analyst  Airmen  begin  to  acquire  information  related  to  their  intelligence question,  either  as  part  of  a  focused  research  effort  or  routine  monitoring  within  their areas  of  responsibility,  they  need  to  employ  a  systematic  approach  to  triaging  and organizing  information  to  identify  trends,  patterns,  and  relationships  relevant  to  their intelligence question.  The use of visualization techniques can assist analysts in deriving meaning from large volumes of fragmented information. 5.2.5.2.  Visualization and analytic modeling are companion concepts to SATs.  Effective visualization  helps  the  analyst  Airman  analyze  and  reason  about  data  and  evidence.  Analytic  models  can  often  help  capture  and  expose  knowledge,  focus  collection  on  the right  needs,  and  apply  analytics  to  the  right  questions.    Visualization  and  analytic modeling  apply  to  both  the  analytic  process  itself,  and  the  delivery  of  information  to consumers.    Their  importance  was  a  key  factor  in  establishing  the  analytic  tradecraft standards of “effective visual information” by the IC and “utility” by the AF. 5.2.5.3.  Like analysis, visualization and analytic modeling are both art and science.  The advent of big data and data analytics has begun to emphasize the science and created the field known as data science.  Data scientists find, interpret, and merge rich data sources; ensure  consistency of data sets; create visualizations to  aid  in  understanding data; build mathematical  models  using  the  data;  and  present  and  communicate  data  insights  and findings to specialists, scientists and non-technical audiences. 5.2.6.  Communication.  Effective communication is essential to the craft of intelligence and even  the  best  intelligence  analysis  falls  short  if  communicated  poorly.    Consumers  often 34 AFH14-133  27 SEPTEMBER 2017 judge the validity of analysis by the quality of how it is communicated.  The importance of communication is underscored by ICDs 203, 206, and 208 and AFI 14-133, which prescribe standards  and  principles  for  dissemination  and  require  annual  assessments  for  compliance.  Analysts use multiple vehicles and formats to communicate their assessments to consumers. 5.2.6.1.  Analytic Writing.  Well-written products share a common set of attributes.  First and foremost, good intelligence writing is analytic.  That means, it does not simply report events;  it  explains  the  significance  of  those  events  and  much  more.    Intelligence assessments  are  structured  so  that  busy  consumers  can  quickly  grasp  the  main  message and  underlying  reasoning,  and  be  clear,  precise,  and  convincing.    In  particular,  analysts minimize the chance for misinterpretation  of the findings, the certainty behind  them, or how  they  were  arrived  at.    Even  the  best  analysis,  if  presented  poorly,  could  cause  the customer to question its credibility. 5.2.6.2.  Visuals.  Whereas data visualization during core research and analysis helps the analyst  to  “discover”  the  story,  visualization  for  presentation  helps  “tell”  the  story.  Visual presentation uses graphics—from charts and graphs to maps and complex tables, and  both  hardcopy  and  digital—to  make  relationships  between  data  more  easily understood. 5.2.6.3.  Briefings.    Briefings  are  a  key  mechanism  for  communicating  analytic judgments to customers and can foster two-way communications to ensure that customer intelligence  questions  are  addressed.    Effective  briefings  consist  of  a  well-organized, clear message relevant to the target audience; appropriate, tailored visual aids to reinforce the message; and a presentational style that keeps the audience focused on the message.  Briefing is a skill that is honed through practice. 5.2.6.4.  Multimedia Products.  Significant innovations in multimedia tools have emerged that  make  possible  sophisticated  products  that  go  beyond  static  graphical  presentations.  Multimedia products are generally either interactive or use full-motion video or animated web  graphics  to  display  content.    Some  techniques  are  particularly  useful  for  depicting changes in data over time or comparing complex or multivariate data by allowing users to choose  which  variable  they  want  to  see.    Despite  these  different  ways  to  communicate analysis, the fundamentals remain the same:  analysts need to present their analysis with clarity and sound logic. 5.2.7.  Collaboration. 5.2.7.1.  Similar  to  critical  and  creative  thinking,  collaboration  is  a  skill  that  extends across  the  entire  analysis  process.    Effective  intelligence  analysis  depends  on  strong interpersonal  relationships  among  analysts  within  and  across  intelligence  agencies  and the way the analysts relate to collectors, customers, and other experts within and outside the  IC.    Analysts  are  expected  to  collaborate  and  team  to  tackle  complex  intelligence questions,  coordinate  analytic  products,  and  engage  in  regular  discussions  with colleagues  that  explore  and  challenge  analytic  judgements  and  prevailing  assumptions.  As  one  of  the  six  AF  intelligence  analysis  tenets,  collaboration  is  considered  a fundamental attribute and priority in AF analysis.  Further, collaboration is the catalyst to every IC member’s responsibility to “provide, discover, and request” as mandated in ICD 501. AFH14-133  27 SEPTEMBER 2017 35 5.2.7.2.  An  important  aspect  of  collaboration  and  teaming  is  analytic  outreach,  which ICD 501 defines as the open, overt, and deliberate act of an IC analyst engaging with an individual  outside  the  IC  to  explore  ideas  and  alternate  perspectives,  gain  new  insights, generate  new  knowledge,  or  obtain  new  information.    Outside  experts  include  those  in academics,  business,  non-governmental  organizations,  scientists,  and  others.    Various methods of analytic outreach include conferences, seminars, exchanges, sabbaticals, and the building of trusted professional relationships. 5.2.7.3.  Skills  required  for  effective  collaboration  include  employing  tools  to  facilitate scheduling,  access  to  data,  and  the  sharing  of  analysis;  effective  team  management practices;  social  networking  techniques;  constructive  criticism—both  giving  and receiving; and interpersonal skills.  Analysts need to also be aware of and take measures to avoid impediments to teaming, especially the “What’s in it for me?” mindset.  A study of  the  collaboration  environment  in  the  IC  in  2007  identified  six  imperatives  to  help overcome  such  mindsets:    mission  criticality,  mutual  benefit,  mutual  trust,  common understanding  through  common  lexicon  and  transparent  rules  of  the  road,  access  and agility  to  identify  collaborators  and  form  collaborative  communities,  and  incentives.  Note:    Derived  from  Integrated  Concepts  Development  Office,  Achieving  a  Robust Collaborative Environment. 5.2.8.  Analytic Design.  Analytic design is the activity of planning, managing, and executing the  analysis  process  end-to-end—from  the  development  of  the  right  intelligence  question, research, and core analysis to the crafting of an assessment that captures and communicates analytic insight for customers.  Although analytic design is described last in this chapter’s list of  skills  and  tradecraft,  it  takes  place  up-front  and  then  continues  throughout  the  analysis process.  In analytic design, the analyst outlines the plan for framing the question, applying SATs, reasoning and mitigating biases, organizing and visualizing data, communicating the analysis,  collaborating  with  all  applicable  entities,  and  employing  critical  and  creative thinking skills.  Then, as the plan is put into action, the analyst revisits and revises the plan, as needed, to comprehensively address the requirement.  More information on this subject is available  at  the  following  site:    ICAT-G/Products  Analytic  Design  Portal,  Joint Worldwide Intelligence Caution-url:  https://intellipedia.intelink.ic.gov/wiki/Portal:IC_Analytic_Tradecraft_Gateway/Analytic_Design. Communications System (JWICS) 5.3.  Key Analysis Concepts. 5.3.1.  Big Data, Data Analytics and Data Science. 5.3.1.1.  According to the AF Future Operating Concept:  A View of the AF in 2035, the term  big  data  describes  large  volumes  of  high-velocity,  complex,  variable  data  that require  advanced  techniques  and  technologies  to  enable  the  capture,  conditioning, reliability,  storage,  distribution,  management,  and  analysis  of  the  information.    The significance  of  big  data  extends  beyond  the  sheer  volume,  complexity,  and  diversity  of data; it is profoundly changing the way we think about data and creates new knowledge and  information.    Note:    Paul  B.  Symon  and  Arzan  Tarapore,  "Defense  Intelligence Analysis  in  the  Age  of  Big  Data,"  Joint  Forces  Quarterly,  p.  4.    Big  data  is  driving  us from  a  perspective  of  “causation”  to  one  of  “correlation.”    Rather  than  the  traditional perspective of analyzing discrete amounts of data to understand the past cause and effect 36 AFH14-133  27 SEPTEMBER 2017 (the why) and use that as a predictor of future behavior, data analytics enables analysts to harness  the  massive  amounts  of  data  available  to  draw  correlations  and  use  patterns  of life (the what) as a predictor of future behavior, even if we do not understand “the why.”  Note:    Kenneth  Neil  Cukier  and  Viktor  Mayer-Schoenberger,  "The  Rise  of  Big  Data:  How  It’s  Changing  the  Way  We  Think  about  the  World,"  Foreign  Affairs.    Figure  5.5, Data Analytics Framework, depicts a general framework for data analytics. Figure 5.5.  Data Analytics Framework.  5.3.1.2.  Data  Science  is  at  the  heart  of  adapting  the  AF  ISR  Enterprise  to  the  evolving big  data  environment.    It  can  generally  be  described  as  the  practice  of  exploiting  and deriving valuable insights from data.  This involves extracting knowledge from data sets that  may  be  small,  large,  structured,  multi-modal,  multi-lingual,  semi-structured  or unstructured.  Since data science is an inherently technical and specialized field, it is best performed by individuals trained and qualified in the complex and specialized nature of the work.  As the DCS for ISR White Paper, Data Science and the USAF ISR Enterprise conveys,  rather  than  train  analyst  Airmen  to  be  data  scientists,  the  AF  approach  is  to develop a force of ISR professionals, operators, and knowledge managers that understand and leverage the capabilities that data scientists bring to the fight.  Figure 5.5 highlights the role of data science relative to analysts in the process of data analytics. 5.3.1.3.  The  implications  of  big  data,  data  analytics,  and  data  science  for  intelligence analysis cannot be overstated.  In recognition of this, the IC has embarked on a number of analytic  modernization  initiatives  to  exploit  emergent  big  data  capabilities,  improve intelligence  integration,  and  accelerate  intelligence  decision  cycles.    Two  major initiatives are object-based production (OBP) and activity-based intelligence (ABI). 5.3.2.  Object-Based Production (OBP). 5.3.2.1.  Traditionally,  analysts  spend  a  great  deal  of  time  and  effort  assembling, collating,  and  parsing  diverse  data  sources  that  pertain  to  a  given  intelligence  problem.  AFH14-133  27 SEPTEMBER 2017 37 As Figure 5.5 illustrates, OBP is a framework for organizing and sharing information.  It is  defined  as  the  act  of  organizing  intelligence  around  objects  of  interest—not  by collection  or  data  type—which  allows  users  to  aggregate  intelligence  information  from across  multiple  intelligence  domains  and  associate  it  with  particular  objects  of  interest.  All  intelligence  that  relates  to  something  that  physically  exists  in  the  real  world  is assembled  and  made  centrally  available  as  an  object  that  all  collectors,  producers,  and consumers  can  access.    Objects  include  physical  things  (e.g.,  ships,  buildings,  vehicles, persons, and political boundaries), as well as abstract things (e.g., events and issues).  The intent of OBP is to provide a consolidated perspective about the behavior of objects and their interaction with one another. 5.3.2.2.  Traditionally,  the  output  of  each  intelligence  discipline  is  assembled  by  an analyst  in  order  to  understand  the  who/what/where/when  of  the  object.    The  OBP alternative  enables  analysis  to  be  directly  attached  to  the  object  in  question  to  allow delivery  of  complete  find,  fix,  and  track  information  direct  to  operational  users.    Thus, intelligence  analysis is  not  stove-piped or the end result of a linear process.    Instead, in this synthetic model, known information is dynamically assembled within the intelligence process.    Automatic  exploitation  systems  and  manual  intelligence  analysis  work  in tandem  to  dynamically  populate  a  shared  community  of  objects  that  all  analysts  have access to.  The result is that analysts can better understand intelligence activity by more clearly  identifying  and  managing  intelligence  gaps  and  spending  less  time  assembling information. 5.3.3.  Activity-Based Intelligence (ABI). 5.3.3.1.  ABI  emerged  from  the  experiences  of  analysts  working  dynamic  targets  and analytic  problems.    It  centers  on  the  discovery  and  association  of  unknown  activities.  DIA,  the  National  Geospatial-Intelligence  Agency  (NGA),  and  the  National  Security Agency  (NSA)  describe  ABI  as  an  analytic  method  applied  to  structured  data  from  all sources,  to  discover  objects  (e.g.,  high-value  target  location),  relationships  (e.g., supplier/consumer), or behaviors (e.g., pattern of life) by resolving significant activity. 5.3.3.2.  NGA  has  delineated  four  ABI  tenants  that  apply  to  a  variety  of  missions  and problem-sets:    1)  geo-reference  to  discover;  2)  integration  before  exploitation;  3)  data neutrality;  and  4)  sequence  neutrality.    As  geo-referenced  activity  becomes  the  starting point of discovery, that allows for the rapid integration of multi-INT data and allows for analysis  without  data-source  or  sequence  biases  presented  by  the  traditional  linear collection process.  Successful ABI analysis relies heavily on geo-referenced data that did not lend itself to an immediate application when it was collected, but eventually enhanced the larger  context  or provided more accurate characterization and understanding of data collected at a later date. 5.3.3.3.  As  ABI  and  OBP  have  grown  to  become  IC-wide  methodologies,  NGA  has advocated and developed a  concept called Structured Observation Management (SOM).  SOM is  the practice and method of organizing and sharing multi-sensor  data that is  not focused  on  objects  (e.g.,  activities  or  events),  in  order  for  the  resulting  data  to  be consistent with, and in support of, both ABI and OBP processes.  It can be thought of as a 'bridge' between the new analytic processes of OBP and ABI. 38 AFH14-133  27 SEPTEMBER 2017 5.3.3.4.  AF  ISR  analysts  need  to  innovate  to  implement  ABI  in  our  mission  sets.    One such effort is Scoped Activity-based Intelligence for Nodal Targeting (SAINT), an ACC-developed  capability  that  operationalizes  ABI,  predominantly  in  support  of  deliberate targeting.    SAINT’s  strength  lies  in  the  rapid  fusion  of  data  and  information  to  create multi-source  intelligence  as  early  in  the  intelligence  cycle  as  possible,  and  close  to  the point  of  collection  in  order  to  enable  collection  refinement.    Figure  5.6,  Traditional Model  for  Target  Discovery,  depicts  the  traditional  model  of  a  linear  production  chain that combines to contribute to content-dominant analysis, a time-consuming approach to Joint  Intelligence  Preparation  of  the  Operational  Environment  (JIPOE)  and  ultimately target  development.    In  contrast,  Figure  5.7,  ABI/OBP  Integrated  Model  for  Target Discovery,  highlights  the  SAINT  construct,  in  which  OBP  enables  fusion  analysis  and micro-target  system  analyses  (TSAs)  in  a  time-dominant  environment.    This  model makes  possible  a  symbiotic  analysis/collections  relationship  to  support  strategic, operational, and tactical objectives simultaneously. Figure 5.6.

Intelligence Requirements and Analytic Focus. 6.1.1.  Questions, Requirements, and Customers. 6.1.1.1.  Intelligence  analysis  and  production  are  driven  by  leading  questions  or requirements  for  intelligence  to  fill  a  gap  in  knowledge  or  understanding  of  the environment, adversary capabilities, centers of gravity, or intentions.  Questions may be more  formal,  such  as  Key  Intelligence  Questions  (KIQs)  from  AF  and  IC  Programs  of Analysis (PoAs), or more informal, such as those that stem from direct, near-term support to operations.  All questions are based on an intelligence organization’s relationship with its customer and an understanding of customer needs. 6.1.1.2.  Intelligence analysis and production are also driven by priorities at all levels of command,  from  the  President  of  the  United  States  down  to  the  tactical  level  of operations.  At the national- and  IC-level,  this primarily manifests itself in  the National Intelligence Priorities Framework (NIPF). 6.1.2.  National Intelligence Priorities Framework (NIPF).  Published annually and reviewed quarterly,  the  NIPF  is  the  primary  mechanism  to  establish,  manage,  and  communicate national intelligence priorities.  Guidance from the President and National Security Advisor determines  overall  priorities.    Secretaries  and  cabinet-level  heads  of  departments  and agencies provide formal input to NIPF development.  The DNI is responsible for developing and  managing  the  NIPF.    All  IC  activities,  including  those  of  the  AF,  adhere  to  the  NIPF priorities.  Note:  See ICD 204, National Intelligence Priorities Framework, for NIPF policy and responsibilities. 6.1.3.  Programs of Analysis (PoAs). 6.1.3.1.  Per  DNI  direction,  each  IC  member  publishes  an  annual  PoA  to  provide comprehensive analysis and production focus for their organization.  Collectively, the IC PoAs offer a framework for collaboration with customers, stakeholders, and IC partners.  The  DNI  has  directed  each  IC  organization  to  annually  publish  a  PoA  to  provide comprehensive intelligence analysis and production focus for their organization. 6.1.3.2.  The  AF  ISR  PoA  (AFISRPoA)  is  organized  into  broad,  overarching  analytic categories, each with multiple KIQs that represent the most pressing analysis required in each  category.    AF  analysis  organizations  use  these  categories  and  KIQs  to  guide  their analytic focus. 6.1.3.3.  All  PoAs  are  to  reference  NIPF  priorities  when  possible.    Additionally,  a  new DoD  Integrated  Defense  Intelligence  Priorities  (IDIP)  process  is  being  implemented  to identify and describe intelligence priorities for the diverse set of DoD customers:  policy, operations,  and  acquisition.    The  IDIP  is  the  DoD  intelligence  inject  into  the  NIPF  and provides  an  additional  layer  of  data  with  traceability  to  analytic  stakeholders.    Analysts reference both the NIPF and IDIP for understanding of analysis and production priorities, and  reference  these  priorities,  when  feasible,  in  development  of  respective  AF intelligence products and services.  Additionally, the IDIP can be used by analysts to help AFH14-133  27 SEPTEMBER 2017 41 frame  internal  resource  and  planning  discussions  across  the  Planning,  Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) cycle. 6.1.3.4.  AFI  14-134  directs  development  of  the  AFISRPoA  and  sub-echelon  PoAs  for NASIC, and the 363 ISRW via 25 AF and ACC.  The intent is for every major AF ISR production element to eventually develop its own PoA to focus on analysis priorities and production.    The  desired  end-state  resulting  from  the  AFISRPoA  and  subordinate  level PoAs would be a more unified AF ISR analysis and production enterprise. 6.1.3.5.  JWICS Intellipedia lists and provides access to all AF and IC PoAs.  A listing of associated  AF  ISR  and  IC  PoAs  resides  on  JWICS  Intellipedia  at  Caution-url:  https://intellipedia.intelink.ic.gov/wiki/Programs_of_Analysis.   Analysts  reference and leverage KIQs that are specific to their analysis mission area, enabling them to work toward  common  AF  and  IC  goals,  improve  efficiency  through  elimination  of  redundant analytic efforts, and expand their collaboration both within and outside the AF. 6.1.4.  Across the AF, DoD, and IC, various terms are used when referring to an intelligence question  and/or  requirement,  including  request  for  information  (RFI),  request  for  support (RFS),  intelligence  need,  intelligence  requirement,  KIQ,  and  production  requirement  (PR).  Henceforth, this publication will use RFI to refer to all types of intelligence questions and/or requirements.  RFIs range from informal to formal and from verbal to formally documented requests.    They  originate  from  an  intelligence  customer  (also  called  an  intelligence consumer), which includes but is not limited to, operational units, acquisition organizations, national  policy  makers,  other  intelligence  elements  throughout  the  AF,  DoD,  and  IC,  and counterintelligence  units,  such  as  AFOSI.    While  RFIs  may  be  explicitly  stated,  analysts anticipate and help shape RFIs, based on known mission needs and a thorough understanding of operations.  Supervisors help ensure their analysts are able to engage with the customer, as needed. 6.1.5.  Requirements  deemed  most  important  to  mission  accomplishment  are  identified  as priority  intelligence  requirements  (PIRs).    By  definition,  these  are  the  critical  requirements that  must  be  satisfied  for  a  commander  and  staff  to  understand  an  adversary  and  the operational  environment  in  order  to  successfully  plan  and  conduct  a  mission.    PIRs  are general  statements  of  intelligence  need,  such  as,  “What  is  the  operational  status  of  the adversary’s  integrated  air  defense  system?”  or  “What  terrorist  groups  are  active  within  the area  of  interest?”    PIRs  provide  the  framework  for  prioritization  of  all  GIISR  operations within  a  CCMD.    PIRs,  combined  with  a  commander’s  friendly  force  information requirements  (FFIRs),  constitute  the  commander’s  critical  information  requirements (CCIRs). 6.1.6.  PIRs drive the development of detailed essential elements of information (EEIs).  EEIs further define the commander’s PIRs by outlining specific information requirements, such as, “What  is  the  current  location  of  the  adversary  SA-20  battalion?”    The  designation  of  PIRs and  EEIs  help  ensure  efforts  are  focused  on  critical  information  needed  to  support warfighters. 6.1.7.  Priority  requirements  in  acquisition  intelligence  are  identified  as  critical  intelligence parameters (CIPs).  A CIP is a factor that defines the threshold at which the performance of a foreign system/capability would likely degrade or nullify the effectiveness of an acquisition program  or details of a  developmental U.S.  system,  the disclosure of which could allow an 42 AFH14-133  27 SEPTEMBER 2017 adversary to effect countermeasures to degrade mission effectiveness of the system, if it were to  be  fielded.    CIPs  are  a  key  concept  for  an  operational  MAJCOM’s  requirements process/documents, as well as for an acquisition program.  They are essentially a PIR for new capabilities going through the requirements and acquisition systems. 6.2.  Intelligence Production  . 6.2.1.  Intelligence production is the development, tailoring, and presentation of intelligence knowledge  via  products  and/or  services  that  meet  or  address  customer  requirements.  Production is an all-encompassing term that ranges from formal, published products on one end of the spectrum (e.g., a formal intelligence summary) to informal, impromptu updates on the other end (e.g., a location update on a tactical  threat  as a pilot  steps to the aircraft).   In some  cases,  analysts  tailor  existing  intelligence  to  answer  customer  requirements.    In  other cases, analysts perform analysis on existing data, information, and intelligence to create new intelligence  and  knowledge.    Still,  in  other  cases  analysts  request  collection  of  new  data  to consider in their analysis. 6.2.2.  Ultimately,  production  culminates  in  at  least  one  intelligence  output  for  a  customer, bringing the cycle full-circle, as depicted in Figure 6.1, Requirement–Production Cycle.  An output may be an intelligence product or an intelligence service. Figure 6.1.  Requirement–Production Cycle.  threat  map, 6.2.3.  An  intelligence  product  is  defined  as  tangible  information  in  written,  visual,  digital, and/or  verbal  form  that:    1)  conveys  information  of  intelligence  value  (e.g.,  written assessment, the accomplishment of an intelligence mission (e.g., assessment checklists, training folders, etc.).  This  definition  is  sufficiently  broad  to  capture  products  that  both  directly  and  indirectly contribute to mission accomplishment, including those associated with intelligence analysis.  The IC has established certain standards that products should meet.  See Attachment 4 for a sample methodology and form to evaluate product standards. targeting  materials,  database,  etc.);  or  2)  facilitates 6.2.4.  An intelligence service is  defined as  assistance provided to  another entity during the performance  of  ISR  support,  including:    1)  the  actual  action  of  delivering  or  conveying intelligence  to  a  user  (e.g.,  presenting  a  briefing,  tipping  and  cuing,  collaboration,  threat modeling, etc.); and 2) the process of enabling an ISR mission (e.g., exercise planning, skill AFH14-133  27 SEPTEMBER 2017 43 knowledge training, security clearance indoctrination, etc.).  Some intelligence services result in additional intelligence products.  Similar to intelligence products, this definition includes services  associated  with  all  categories  of  ISR  mission  accomplishment,  one  being intelligence analysis. 6.2.5.  AF products and services are grouped into 14 product lines and 14 service lines.  See Attachment 2 for descriptions of each product and service line. 6.3.  Request  for  Information  (RFI)  and  Analysis/Production  Process  .    AFI  14-134 establishes  and  details  the  AF  RFI  and  analysis/production  process.    Figure  6.2,  RFI  and Analysis/Production  Process,  illustrates  the  basic  RFI  flow  that  occurs  at  each  organizational level.    Figure  6.3,  RFI  and  Analysis/Production  Process  across  the  AFIAE,  depicts  the  flow across  the  whole  analysis  enterprise.    The  RFI  and  analysis/production  process  operationalizes the  layered,  distributed,  mutually  supporting  AFIAE.    It  is  the  construct  through  which  AF intelligence  entities  address  customer  requirements,  share  analytic  findings,  tap  into  analysis expertise  across  the  IC,  and  collaborate  on  production.    It  is  the  mechanism  that  enables  the AFIAE to achieve decision advantage.  Refer to AFI 14-134, Chapter 3 for specifics on the RFI process, categorization, tracking, and timelines. Figure 6.2.  RFI and Analysis/Production Process.  44 AFH14-133  27 SEPTEMBER 2017 Figure 6.3.  RFI and Analysis/Production Process across the AFIAE. 6.4.  Acquisition Intelligence  Production.   Intelligence analysis and production are integral to the entire life cycle process  of requirements definition,  acquisition, and sustainment  of weapon  AFH14-133  27 SEPTEMBER 2017 45 systems.    Acquisition  customers  require  the  production  of  specific  threat  assessments  and potentially  unique  forms  of  data  to  support  research,  development,  test  and  fielding  of warfighting  capabilities.    Acquisition  intelligence  analysts  support  acquisition  programs  and initiatives  by  helping  to  identify  and  document  intelligence  dependencies  (such  as  Intelligence Mission  Data  [IMD],  modeling  and  simulation,  etc.)  that  provide  critical  input  to  intelligence production  efforts  and  the  development  of  product/service  requirements.    As  part  of  threat support  to  acquisition,  NASIC  and  other  service  intelligence  centers  continually  monitor  and produce  intelligence  on  adversary  capabilities  deemed  critical  to  operational  success  for  the developing capability.  In partnership, acquisition intelligence specialists, operational command intelligence  planners,  and  service  intelligence  center  analysts  provide  direct  support  to acquisition  decision  processes,  as  defined  in  the  DIAP  Users  Guide  and  DoD  directives  and instructions.    These  documents  provide  additional  guidance  for  specific  requirements  and resourcing activities.

Intelligence Support Element—An AF intelligence organization at any echelon whose focus is on providing intelligence for AF planning, operation, or decisions. ISR Activity—A task undertaken by a member of the ISR community that is associated with the accomplishment  of  an  intelligence  mission.    An  ISR  Activity  could  result  in  one  or  more intelligence  outputs.    ISR  Activities  do  not  include  tasks  carried  out  by  ISR  personnel  that  are unrelated  to  a  specific  intelligence  mission,  such  as  security  force  augmentation,  honor  guard duty, professional military education, or physical training. ISR Output—The result of an ISR Activity.  An output is categorized as either an ISR product or an ISR service.  Single or multiple outputs may derive from one activity, or one output could be  derived  from  multiple  Activities.    All  outputs  relate  directly  or  indirectly  to  the accomplishment of an intelligence mission. ISR  Product—A  specific  type  of  output  from  an  ISR  activity  that  consists  of  tangible information  in  written,  visual,  digital,  and/or  verbal  form  that  conveys  information  of intelligence value (e.g., written assessment, threat map, and targeting materials) or facilitates the accomplishment  of  an  intelligence  mission  (e.g.,  ISR  program  element  code  build,  self-assessment checklist, or training folder). ISR  Service—A  type  of  output  from  an  ISR  Activity.    Assistance  provided  to  another  entity during  the  performance  of  an  ISR  mission:    (1)  the  actual  action  of  delivering  or  conveying intelligence  to  a  user  (e.g.,  presenting  a  briefing,  tipping  and  cuing,  collaboration,  or  threat modeling),  or  (2)  the  process  of  enabling  an  ISR  mission  (e.g.,  exercise  planning,  skill AFH14-133  27 SEPTEMBER 2017 57 knowledge training, or security clearance indoctrination).

Lead/Designated Producer—The primary analysis and production organization responsible for integrating  collaborative  analysis  with  its  own  to  provide  a  comprehensive  and  accurate intelligence product or service to a customer. Lesson Learned—An observation that, when validated and resolved, results in an improvement in military operations or activities at the strategic, operational, or tactical level and in long-term, internalized change to an individual or an organization. Multi-Source  Analysis  (also  called  Multi—INT  Analysis)—Intelligence  analysis  that  makes use of more than one source when access to additional potential sources is limited by reasons of timeliness, system access, location, or security levels. Priority  Intelligence  Requirement  (PIR)—A critical  requirement that a  commander and staff need to understand the adversary or operational environment to conduct the mission.  A PIR is typically comprised of multiple, specific Essential Elements of Information (EEIs).

Service Intelligence Center—The analysis center designated for each military service.  The AF has designated NASIC as the service intelligence center for the AF. Single-Source Analysis (also called Exploitation)—Intelligence analysis that employs a single source or expertise in a functional area to characterize events, people, or things.  Such analysis is limited to describing, rather than evaluating, the topic of a particular analysis due to restrictions inherent  in  single-source  intelligence  collection,  precluding  the  ability  to  provide  fully contextualized intelligence assessments.  58 AFH14-133  27 SEPTEMBER 2017 Attachment 2 PRODUCT AND SERVICE LINES A2.1.  As Table A2.1, Product and Service Line Categories, illustrates, AF products and services are grouped into 14 product lines and 14 service lines, which can be further classified into four general  categories:    awareness;  mission-specific;  representation;  and  enabling.    Sections  A2.2 and A2.3 describe each product and service line. Table A2.1.  Product and Service Line Categories. Category Product Lines Service Lines  Awareness  Intelligence Assessment Threat Study Intelligence Summary Intelligence Report Intelligence Alert  Analysis Situational Awareness Collaboration Intelligence Supportability Analysis  Mission Specific  Mission Document Targeting Document Requirement    Database Briefing Display Model  Policy, Plan or Program Mission Support Document  Representation  Enabling  Mission Operations Targeting Mission Readiness Operational Mission Training Requirements Management       ISR Professional Training Policy, Planning, and Programming Force Management ISR Systems Security       Notes: 1.  Some Product and Service Lines have similar labels.  A good rule of thumb in distinguishing between them is that a Product Line is focused on a tangible output while a Service Line is focused on the action, process or function that results in the Product Line. 2.  Product Lines include sanitized and releasable versions of products. 3.  The scope, focus, and window of analysis decrease from Assessments to Alerts. 4.  The Enabling category includes those products and services that indirectly contribute to substantive intelligence but, in and of themselves, do not have a primary purpose of AFH14-133  27 SEPTEMBER 2017 59 substantive intelligence.

The list is not intended to be comprehensive or all inclusive, nor is it intended to serve as a checklist that analyst Airmen are expected to meet.  The aim is for analyst Airmen and analysis organizations across the AF to refine and expand the list over time. 2.  Key sources for the lessons learned in this table include subject matter experts, various AF/A2 reviews of intelligence analysis, and a study by RAND Corporation:  Brien Alkire, et al., Leveraging the Past to Prepare for the Future of Air Force Intelligence Analysis, RR-1330-AF. A3.2.  Some of the intelligence analysis lessons in Table A3.1 have been formally documented in some form or fashion via the AF Lessons Learned (LL) Program (AFLLP).  The AFLLP exists to  enhance  readiness  and  improve  combat  capability  by  capitalizing  on  the  experiences  of Airmen and organizations.  A lesson learned is an observation that, when validated and resolved, results  in  an  improvement  in  military  operations  or  activities  at  the  strategic,  operational,  or tactical  level  and  in  long-term,  internalized  change  to  an  individual  or  an  organization.    The AFLLP is part of the larger Joint Lessons Learned Program (JLLP).  The  Joint LL Information System (JLLIS) is used to track and disseminate LLs throughout the AF, DoD, and  IC.  JLLIS allows  AF  personnel  to  search,  submit,  and  manage  all  AF  Observations,  Lessons  Identified, After Action Reports, LLs, and other information up to TOP SECRET/Sensitive Compartmented Information located  at  SIPRNet  Caution-url:  https://www.jllis.smil.mil.    All  analyst  Airmen  are  encouraged  to  register  in  JLLIS  and  enter observations  that  contain  potential  lessons  into  JLLIS  for  coordination  through  the  AFLLP and/or inform their local chain of command as appropriate.   The  JLLIS  database (TS/SCI). is 64 AFH14-133  27 SEPTEMBER 2017 A3.3.  In  addition,  several  MAJCOMs  actively  acquire  lessons  learned  or  best  practices.    For example, HQ ACC/A2OO (Weapons and Tactics) has established a program to capture lessons learned, TTPs, and experience from ISR professionals returning from deployments.  AFH14-133  27 SEPTEMBER 2017 65 Attachment 4 SAMPLE STANDARDS EVALUATION METHODOLOGY A4.1.  IAW  AFI  14-133,  MAJCOM/A2s  and  the  NASIC/CC  are  responsible  for  developing  a means to annually measure and assess AF intelligence analysis standards via SACs for reporting in  the  MICT.    In  addition,  the  DNI  requires  the  AF  to  annually  evaluate  specified  “covered products”  for  compliance  with  IC  standards.    Table  A4.1,  IC  Product  Evaluation  Criteria  and Rating  Scales,  delineates  IC  analytic  tradecraft  standards  for  use  in  assessment  and  “covered product”  evaluations.    The  JWICS  Advanced  Global  Intelligence  Learning  Environment (AGILE) offers computer-based training on how to conduct product evaluations.  It is important to  note  that  while  AF  tradecraft  standards  align  with  IC  standards,  the  AF  evaluates  two additional  standards:    timeliness  and  customer  engagement.    Table  A4.2,  Sample  Tradecraft Criteria for Timeliness, and Table A4.3, Sample Tradecraft Criteria for Customer Engagement, offer considerations for self-assessment on these two additional AF standards.

Analysts are responsible for engaging with customers and end-users of intelligence to understand what they need and when they need it in order to deliver information and knowledge at the earliest time and place to enable customers to effectively make decisions and take action.  Timeliness is about ensuring awareness, creating opportunities, and enabling warfighting decision advantage. Table A4.3.  Sample Tradecraft Criteria for Customer Engagement. 1. Poor (0) 2.

KEY ASSUMPTIONS CHECK  A  diagnostic  technique  that  identifies  hypotheses  analysts have  accepted  to  be  true  and  that  form  the  basis  of  the assumption  Four-Step Process 1.  Review the analytic line on the issue; write it down for all to see and defend it orally 2.  Articulate all the premises, both stated and unstated in finished  intelligence,  that  are  accepted  as  true  for  this analytic line to be valid 3.  Challenge each assumption, asking why it must be true and whether it remains valid under all conditions 4.  Refine the list of key assumptions to contain only those that must  be  true  to  sustain  your  analytic  line;  consider  under what  conditions,  or  in  the  face  of  what  information,  these assumptions might not hold  Questions to Ask How much confidence exists that this assumption is correct? What explains the degree of confidence in the assumption? What circumstances or information might undermine this assumption? Is a key assumption more likely a key uncertainty or key factor? Could  the  assumption have  been true in  the  past but  be  less  so now? If  the  assumption  proves  wrong,  would  it  significantly  alter the  analytic line?  If so, how? Has this process identified new factors that need further analysis? 76 AFH14-133  27 SEPTEMBER 2017 Figure A5.8.  Quality of Information Check.  AFH14-133  27 SEPTEMBER 2017 77 Figure A5.9.

ISSUE DEVELOPMENT  A  divergent  technique  that  opens  the  mind  of  the  analyst to  substantive  alternatives.    Restating  a  problem  opens  it  up and  reveals  important  perspectives  and  issues  otherwise overlooked.  Start with the initial poorly defined/stated issue 1.  Paraphrase:  Redefine  the  issue  without  losing  the  original meaning 2.  180 Degrees:  Turn the issue on its head.  Is the issue the one asked or the opposite of it? 3.  Broaden the Focus:  Instead of focusing on only one piece of the puzzle, step back and look at several pieces together 4.  Narrow  the  Focus:    Can  the  issue  be  broken  down  further?  Take the question and ask about the components that make  up the problem 5.  Redirect the Focus:  What outside forces impinge on this issue?   Is deception involved? 6.  Ask Why:    Question the initial issue or question.   Develop a new question based on the answer.    Then question the second question and develop a new question based on that  answer.  Repeat  this  process  until  you  believe  the  real problem emerges.   This  process  is  particularly  effective  in  generating possible alternatives  End with a final refined issue 82 AFH14-133  27 SEPTEMBER 2017 Figure A5.14.  Question Refinement.  QUESTION REFINEMENT  A  simple  analytical  technique  used  to  ensure  analysts  are answering  the  right  question  when  responding  to  a  customer’s intelligence requirement.  7-Step Process 1.  New Development - Describe a change to the operating environment or security interests that result in a  requirement for intelligence analysis and production. 2.  Raw Question(s) - In response to the New Development, the immediate questions that come to mind, or that would come  to mind for your customer.   In relation to an event of interest, the raw questions could be, "Who did it and why?"  or "What caused it?" 3.  Key Issue - A key issue area normally includes an issue area  and a geographic area.    Issue areas are substantive  categories  of policy,  strategy,  or  war  fighting  function.  Key  issue  areas  for  a military  operation  can  often  be  found  in  campaign descriptions of the lines of effort. 4.  National Interests - The big picture must be considered thoughtfully  when  refining  the  intelligence  requirement.   Analysts  should  be  able  to  tie  assessments  to  U.S.  security interests in general. 5.  Specific  Customer  Concerns - This  section  of  the  refinery  is often  used  to  determine  what  questions  are  relevant  and required  to  fulfill  the  intelligence  question  versus  those  specific requirements  that  might  be  better  answered  separately. 6.  Time  Frame - Answering  your  intelligence  requirement  should be targeted at a particular time, normally in the  future (ex: “in the next 6 months,” or “before 1 May 201X”). 7.  Refined Question - The refined intelligence question should  be open-ended, requiring more than a yes or no answer, and should meet a specific customer’s intelligence needs. AFH14-133  27 SEPTEMBER 2017 83 Figure A5.15.

HIGH IMPACT / LOW PROBABILITY  A  technique  used  to  highlight  a  seemingly  unlikely  event that  would have major policy consequences if it happened.  If  there  is  a  strongly- held  view  that  an  event  is  unlikely, then  postulating precisely the opposite should not be difficult.  Perform  the  following  steps  to  determine  the  effects  of  High Impact/Low Probability events:  1.  Define the high-impact outcome clearly.    This process is what will justify examining what most analysts believe to be a very unlikely development 2.  Devise one or more plausible explanations for or “pathways” to the low probability outcome.  This should be as precise as possible,  as  it  can  help  identify  possible  indicators  for  later monitoring 3.  Insert  possible  triggers  or  changes  in  momentum  if appropriate.    These  can be  natural  disasters,  sudden health problems of key leaders, or new economic or political shocks that might have occurred historically or in other parts of the world 4.  Brainstorm  with  analysts  having  a  broad  set  of  experiences to  aid  the  development  of  plausible  but  unpredictable triggers of sudden change 5.  Identify for each pathway a set of indicators or “observables” that  would  help  you  anticipate  that  events  were  beginning to play out this way 6.  Identify factors that  would  deflect  a bad  outcome  or encourage a positive outcome 86 AFH14-133  27 SEPTEMBER 2017 Figure A5.18.  “What If” Analysis.  “WHAT IF” ANALYSIS  That  “What  If?”  Analysis technique  which assumes  an  event  has  occurred  with  potential  (negative  or positive) impact  and explains how it might come about.  Method the is 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. Assume the event has happened Select some triggering events that permitted the scenario to unfold to help make the “what if” more plausible; for example, analysts might postulate the death of a leader, a natural disaster, or some economic event that would start a chain of other events Develop a chain of argumentation based as much on logic as evidence to explain how this outcome could have come about “Think backwards” from the event in concrete ways–that is, specifying what must actually occur at each stage of the scenario is often very useful Identify one or more plausible pathways or scenarios to the unlikely event; very often more than one will appear possible Generate a list of indicators or “observables” for each  scenario that would help to detect the beginnings of the  event Consider the scope of the positive and negative consequences of each scenario and their relative impacts 8.

As depicted in Table A6.3, Major Intelligence Analysis Entities of the Military  Services,  each  military  service  has  a  SIO  that  oversees  intelligence  policy,  planning, programming, and activities on behalf of the service chief.  The AF SIO is the DCS for ISR, also known as the AF/A2.  Each service is authorized one service intelligence center, also called an intelligence  analysis  center.    The  AF’s  service  intelligence  center  is  NASIC.    The  AF  has assigned  the  ACC  as  its  lead  MAJCOM  for  the  GIISR  capability,  which  includes  intelligence analysis.  Similarly, other military services have assigned significant analysis responsibilities to various organizations.  All services routinely reach out to each other for service-unique expertise and collaboration in addressing analysis requirements. Table A6.3.

The book analyzes the varied aspects of what is known as "high-level foreign positive intelligence."  Kent asserts that very little of it involves cloaks and 96 AFH14-133  27 SEPTEMBER 2017 daggers.  All of it is important to national survival, and should be understood by the citizens of a democracy. Kerbel, Josh, and Anthony Olcott, Synthesizing with Clients, Not Analyzing for Customers, Studies in Intelligence, Vol. 54, No. 4. December 2010, https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol.-54-no.-4/synthesizing-with-clients-not-analyzing-for.html This article discusses the challenges, purpose, and shortcomings of the separation between analysts and the policy/decision makers they inform.  One purpose is to avoid politicization of analysis and mitigate confirmation biases, but the separation can also lead to unanswered questions from decision-makers or ignored reports created by the analysts but not read. Lowenthal, Mark M., Intelligence:  From Secrets to Policy, 6th edition, CQ Press, 2014 This text provides an introduction to the field of intelligence, from both the analyst and policymaker perspectives.

White, Jeffrey, Shakespeare for Analysts:  Literature and Intelligence, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, 2013 This paper, originally sponsored by the Joint Military Intelligence College in 2003, advocates inclusion of Shakespeare in intelligence analysts’ bookshelves.  The author asserts that since analysts are concerned with human personalities within political and military leadership, analysts should use Shakespeare’s work as insight into how people are motivated and pursue power. Zegart, Amy B., Flawed by Design:  The Evolution of the CIA, JCS, and NSC, Stanford University Press, 2000 Using an institutionalist approach, the author asserts that the CIA, Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), and National Security Council (NSC) are hindered from operating effectively by design.  Frequent elections, the prominence of elected officials controlling these organizations, and Congressional checks foster competitive, rival organizations fighting amongst themselves to protect their own intelligence assets. A8.2.  Analysis  Skills,  Tradecraft,  and  Processes  in  General  .    Whereas  section  A8.1 identifies  sources  that  specifically  address  IC  skills,  tradecraft,  and  processes,  the  following AFH14-133  27 SEPTEMBER 2017 97 sources apply to  the discipline of analysis writ large.  While the following were written with  a broader academia focus, they are also relevant to IC analysis.

Gooch, John, and Amos Perlmutter, Military Deception and Strategic Surprise, Digital Printing, 2007 The six essays in this book deal primarily with the theory of deception and strategic-level deception.  They present a picture of the dynamics and potential benefits of deception.  Examples of operational-level deception are mentioned in some of the essays to illustrate certain points. Latimer, Jon, Deception in War:  The Art of the Bluff, the Value of Deceit, and the Most Thrilling Episodes of Cunning in Military History, from the Trojan Horse to the Gulf War, The Overlook Press, 2001 This work shows how simple some tricks have been, but also how technology has increased the range and subtlety of what is possible―bogus radio traffic, virtual images, even false smells.  He draws examples from land, sea, and air to show how great commanders have always had, as Winston Churchill put it, that indispensable “element of legerdemain, an original and sinister touch, which leaves the enemy puzzled as well as beaten.” A8.7.
