SUMMARY OF CHANGES This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.  Responsibilities were updated  according  to  Program  Action  Directive  (PAD)  14-03,  Realignment  of  the  Air  Force Weather Agency. 1.  Policy.  This  directive  governs  AF  weather  policy  and  oversight  for  weather  operations  that characterize the environment and exploit weather information in support of designated national security objectives. 1.1.  Within  the  AF,  weather  operations  are  considered  a  subset  of  the  Global  Integrated Intelligence, Reconnaissance and Surveillance core function. 2 AFPD15-1  12 NOVEMBER 2015 1.2.  AF  weather  operations  are  an  essential  support  and  service  capability  across  all designated AF core functions and Army warfighting functions. 1.3.  The AF conducts weather operations to provide accurate, timely, relevant and consistent air  and  space  environmental  information  to  AF  and  specified  Army  units,  including  their respective  Reserve  components,  and  as  directed,  joint  forces,  coalition  forces,  and  other agencies, such as those combat support agencies under the purview of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence as defined in DoDD 3000.06, Combat Support Agencies (CSAs). 1.4.  Weather  personnel  characterize  and  enable  exploitation  of  the  environment  through collection,  processing,  analysis  and  prediction,  tailoring,  and  dissemination  of  atmospheric and  space  weather  data  and  information  from  DoD,  allied  military,  interagency,  and  other sources.    This  processed  information  may  be  further  tailored  and  is  integrated  for  use  by decision-makers at the strategic, operational and tactical levels.   These processes contribute to two distinct, yet related, primary functions: (1) characterizing the past, current, and future weather  conditions,  and  (2)  exploiting  those  conditions  as  actionable  and  authoritative information, injected at key decision points supporting military operations. 1.5.  Data  and  information  on  the  state  of  the  air  and  space  environment  are  essential elements  of  all  military  operations.    Environmental  situational  awareness  is  critical  to predictive  battlespace  awareness  and  enables  commanders  at  all  levels  to  exploit  the conditional  state(s)  of  the  atmosphere  and  space    environments  and  the  effects  of  those conditions  on  military  operations  in  order  to  achieve  specified  mission  objectives.  Commanders  must  integrate  the  effects  of  the  air  and  space  environments  on  friendly  and enemy  capabilities  into  appropriate  risk  management  and  military  decision-making processes. 2.  Roles and Responsibilities. 2.1.  The  Office  of  the  Office  of  the  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  and  the  Air  Staff  are responsible for policy and resource advocacy and allocation for weather operations provided by the Air Force. 2.2.  Deputy Chief of Staff (DCS), Operations, (HQ USAF/A3) is responsible for: 2.2.1.  Weather  operations  and  capabilities  to  support  military  operations  and  direct support to elements of the AF and the U.S. Army according to interservice directives and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 3810.01D, Meteorological and Oceanographic Operations.  2.2.2.  Implementing  Global  Force  Management  force  allocation  guidance  for  AF weather  capabilities,  working  with  JCS,  to  organize  and  allocate  these  capabilities  to meet  Combatant  Commander  requirements  according  to  AFPD  10-4,  Operations Planning:  Air  &  Space  Expeditionary  Force  (AEF).    Providing  policy  and  guidance  to assign  all  AF  military  weather  personnel  against  AEF  Indicators,  including  assessment and  monitoring  of  AF-wide  weather  technical  performance  and  effectiveness  and operational readiness of weather capabilities. 2.2.3.  Space weather operations capabilities in support of all elements of the DoD.  AFPD15-1  12 NOVEMBER 2015 3 2.2.4.  Authoritative  climate  data  and  information  in  support  of,  and  consistent  with  National Climate Assessments and associated DoD activities involving the mitigation and adaptation of DoD and military planning and resource decisions, worldwide. 2.2.5.  Guidance  and  procedures  to  implement  AF  weather  operations,  to  include  AF Modeling and Simulation activities for the Air and Space Natural Environment according to  DoDI  5000.70,  Management  of  DoD  Modeling  and  Simulation  Activities,  and  AFPD 16-10, Modeling and Simulation. 2.2.6.  Oversight  and  advocacy  for  the  AF  Weather  Weapon  Systems  (AFWWS)  to include  strategic  planning,  architecture,  capabilities-based  analyses,  programming, budgeting and sustainment. 2.2.7.  Weather expertise in response to HQ USAF, DoD, interagency, international, and other  government  inquiries  for  space  weather,  climatological  or  other  weather-related topics, as required. 2.3.  Major  Command  (MAJCOM)  commanders  providing  support  to  AF  and/or  Army missions shall: 2.3.1.  Employ  appropriately  sized  weather  staffs  to  provide  theater  specific,  strategic-level advice, subject matter expertise, staff support, and coordination. the  environment  and information  within  military  decision-making  processes. 2.3.2.  Organize,  train  and  equip  assigned  weather  personnel  to  perform  two  primary to  enable  exploitation  of functions:  characterization  of environmental   Weather personnel  process  and  disseminate  the  outputs  of  collection,  analysis,  prediction  and tailoring  of  environmental  information  in  order  to  integrate  them  into  operations  and intelligence  decision-making  processes  while  also  providing  a  forward  presence  for reachback  organizations.    This  allows  decision-makers  to  exploit  air  and  space environmental  information  to  gain  an  operational  advantage  and  mitigate  risk.
