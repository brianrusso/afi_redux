This CFETP provides information necessary for the Air Force Career Field Manager (AFCFM), MAJCOM functional managers (MFMs), commanders, training managers, supervisors, and trainers to plan, develop, manage, and conduct an effective and efficient career field training program.  The plan outlines the training that individuals must receive in order to develop and progress throughout their career.  For the purpose of this plan, training is divided into four areas:  initial skills, upgrade training (UGT), qualification training (QT), and continuation training (CT).  Initial skills training is the Air Force Specialty specific training an individual receives upon entry into the Air Force or upon retraining into this specialty for award of the 3-skill level.  Upgrade training identifies the mandatory courses, task qualification requirements, and correspondence course completion required for award of the 3-, 5-, 7-, and 9- skill levels.  Qualification training is actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an airman in a specific duty position.  This training program occurs both during and after the upgrade training process.  It is designed to provide the performance skills/knowledge training required for the job.  Continuation training is additional training either in-residence or exportable advanced training courses, or on-the-job training provided to personnel to increase their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required.  The CFETP has several purposes, some are: 1.1. Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field training program.   1.2. Identifies task and knowledge training requirements and recommends education and training for each skill level and phase of an individual’s career in this AFS. 1.3. Lists training courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of training, and the training medium. 1.4. Identifies major resource constraints that impact full implementation of the desired career field training program. 2.  Uses.   The plan will be used by MFMs and supervisors at all levels to ensure comprehensive and cohesive training programs are available and/or instituted for each individual in the specialty. 2.1. AETC training personnel will develop and revise formal resident, non-resident, field and exportable training based on requirements established by the user and documented in Part II of the CFETP.  They will also work with the AFCFM to develop acquisition strategies for obtaining resources needed to provide the identified training. 2.2. MFMs will ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial and upgrade skills requirements.  OJT, resident training, contract training, or exportable courses can satisfy identified requirements.  MAJCOM-developed training to support this AFSC must be identified for inclusion in this plan and must not duplicate available training resources. 2.3. Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan.  The list of courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training. 2.4. Personnel in AFSCs 1AXXX or 1U0X1 are exempt from maintaining OJT Training Folders (AF Form 623). All training is documented via AF Form 8 Certificate of Aircrew Qualification by trained flight examiners.  Qualification on the AF Form 8 eliminates the requirement to document STS items in this CFETP.   3.  Coordination and Approval. The AFCFM is the approval authority.  MAJCOM functional managers and AETC training managers will identify and coordinate on the career field training requirements.  The AFCFM will initiate an annual review of this document and coordinate with AETC and MFMs to ensure currency and accuracy. Using the list of courses in Part II, they will eliminate duplicate training. Send applicable inputs/changes to this CFETP through MAJCOM Functional Managers to HQ USAF/A3O-AM, 1480 Air Force Pentagon, Washington D.C. 20330-1480 or the following organizational email address:  usaf.pentagon.af-a3.mbx.a3oim-workflow@mail.mil.    8 CFETP 1A1X1 19 January 2016 Section B - Career Progression and Information 4.

Adequate training and timely progression from the apprentice to the superintendent skill level plays an extremely important role in the Air Force’s ability to accomplish its mission.  Therefore, it is essential that everyone involved in training do their part to plan, develop, manage, conduct and evaluate an effective and efficient training program.  The guidance provided in this part of the CFETP will ensure individuals receive viable training at the appropriate points in their career.  AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted) and Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory (AFECD) identify mandatory requirements for the specialty description.  The following narrative and the AFSC 1A1XX career field flow charts identify the training career path.  They define the training required in an individual’s career. 5.1. Apprentice (3) Level.  Meeting requirements listed in AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted), and specialty description completion of the Aircrew Fundamentals Course at Lackland AFB, TX is mandatory for pipeline and non-aviation service cross training students.  The Basic Flight Engineer (BFE) course at Lackland AFB, TX is mandatory for award of the 3-skill level AFSC.  Initial skills training requirements are identified and revised (if necessary) annually during the 1A1X1 Utilization and Training Workshop (U&TW).  Task and knowledge requirements are identified in the STS, Part II, Sections A and B.  Individuals must complete an initial skills course to be awarded AFSC 1A131. 5.2.  Journeyman (5) Level To be awarded AFSC 1A151, the trainee must complete requirements as listed in the applicable MAJCOM aircrew training directives , initial qualification training, and a successful form 8.   5.3. Craftsman (7) Level.  To be awarded AFSC 1A171, the trainee  must be a SSgt, complete all 3- and 5-skill level training requirements and meet all requirements as listed in the applicable MAJCOM aircrew training directives and have completed  a minimum of 12 months fully mission qualified.
