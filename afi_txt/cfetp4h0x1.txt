The  ever-changing  Air  and  Space  Expeditionary  Force  (AEF)  environment  requires  vision, preparation, and attention to ensure people have the right skills and tools to deliver the capabilities and the support required by the war fighter in meeting the Air Force (AF) mission of today and vision of the future.  Declining resources, expanding mission diversity, and new technologies in the AF are impacting the readiness of our most valuable resource—people.  These factors will continue to exist in the future, making it essential for the workforce to be effectively and efficiently trained to perform duties within each skill level of an Air Force Specialty (AFS).  To meet the challenges of tomorrow, the AF must place a greater emphasis on career field training today.   2. This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive education and training document that identifies life-cycle education and training requirements, training support resources, and minimum requirements for the deliberate development of the 4H0X1 Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC).  The CFETP will provide Cardiopulmonary Laboratory personnel a clear career path to success and will instill rigor in all aspects of career field training.  Note:  Civilians occupying associated positions will use Part II to support duty position qualification training.      3.  The CFETP consists of two parts.  Supervisors plan, manage, and control training within the specialty using both parts of the plan.  3.1.  Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty.  Section A, General Information  explains  how  everyone  will  use  the  plan.    Section  B,  Career  Field  Progression  and Information identifies career field progression, duties and responsibilities, training strategies, and career field  path.    Section  C,  Skill  Level  Training  Requirements  associates  each  skill  level  with  specialty qualifications  (knowledge,  education,  training,  and  other).    Section  D,  Resource  Constraints  lists deficiencies  in  resources  needed  to  accomplish  the  training  mission,  such  as  funds,  manpower, equipment,  and  facilities.    Section  E,  Transitional  Training  Guide  identifies  transition  training  guide requirements for use with merging career fields.  3.2.  Part II provides a comprehensive list of training courses and standards available to support career field  training  requirements.    Part  II  includes  the  following:    Section  A,  Specialty  Training  Standard (STS)  includes  duties,  tasks,  technical  references  to  support  training,  Air  Education  and  Training Command  (AETC)  conducted  training,  wartime  course,  core  tasks,  and  correspondence  course requirements.  Section B, Course Objective List (COL) identifies the standards supervisors will use to determine  if  Airmen  satisfy  training  requirements.    Section  C,  Support  Materials  identifies  available support  materials.    An  example  is  a  Qualification  Training  Package  (QTP),  developed  to  support proficiency  training.    These  packages  are  identified  and  made  available  on  the  official  Air  Force Electronic  Publications  website,  along  with  the  CFETP.    Section  D,  Training  Course  Index  is  a  tool supervisors can use to determine if resources are available to support training.  Included here are both mandatory  and  optional  courses.    Section  E,  Major  Command  (MAJCOM)-Unique  Requirements identifies specific requirements supervisors can use to determine if additional training is required for the 4    associated  MAJCOM  unique  qualification  needs.    Section  F,  Documentation  of  Training  provides guidance on documentation of training (medical specific) in the Air Force Training Record (AFTR).      4.  Using guidance provided in the CFETP will ensure individuals in this specialty receive effective and efficient training at the appropriate points in their career.  This plan will enable us to train today's work force for tomorrow's jobs.  At unit level, supervisors and trainers will use Part II to identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan.

This  CFETP  provides  the  information  necessary  for  AFCFMs,  MAJCOM  Functional Managers (MFM), commanders, training managers, supervisors and trainers to plan, develop, manage, and  conduct  an  effective  and  efficient  career  field  training  program.  The  plan  outlines  the  training individuals in this AFS should receive in order to develop and progress throughout their career. This plan  identifies  initial  skills,  upgrade,  qualification,  advanced  and  proficiency  training.  Initial  skills training is the AFS specific training an individual receives upon entry into the AF or upon retraining into this specialty for award of the 3-skill level. Normally, this training is conducted by AETC at one of the technical training centers. Upgrade training identifies the mandatory courses, task qualification requirements, and correspondence course completion requirements for award of the 3-, 5-, 7-, 9-skill level.  Qualification  training  is  actual  hands-on  task  performance  training  designed  to  qualify  an Airman in a specific duty position. This training program occurs both during and  after the upgrade training process. It is designed to provide the performance skills and knowledge required to do the job. Advanced  training  is  formal  specialty  training  used  for  selected  airmen.  Proficiency  training  is additional training, either in-residence or exportable advanced training courses, or on-the- job training provided  to  personnel  to  increase  their  skills  and  knowledge  beyond  the  minimum  required  for upgrade. The CFETP has several purposes—some are:  1.1.  Serves  as  a  management  tool  to  plan,  manage,  conduct,  and  evaluate  a  career  field-training program.  Also, it is used to help supervisors identify training at the appropriate point in an individual’s career.  1.2.  Identifies  task  and  knowledge  training  requirements  for  each  skill  level  in  the  specialty  and recommends education and training throughout each phase of an individual’s career.  1.3.  Lists  training  courses  available  in  the  specialty  identifies  sources  of  training,  and  the  training delivery method.  1.4.  Identifies  major  resource  constraints  that  impact  full  implementation  of  the  desired  career  field training process.  2.  Uses.  The plan will be used by MFMs and supervisors at all levels to ensure comprehensive and cohesive training programs are available for each individual in the specialty.  2.1.  AETC training personnel will develop or revise formal resident, nonresident, field and exportable training  based  upon  requirements  established  by  the  users  and  documented  in  Part  II  of  the  CFETP.  They will also work with the AFCFM to develop acquisition strategies for obtaining resources needed to provide the identified training.  2.2.  MFMs will ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial, upgrade, and proficiency requirements.  OJT, resident training, and contract training or exportable courses can satisfy  identified  requirements.    MAJCOM-developed  training  to  support  this  AFSC  must  be identified for inclusion into the plan.   2.3.  Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan.  The list of courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training. 3.  Coordination and Approval.  The AFCFM is the approval authority.  The AFCFM will initiate an annual  review  of  this  document  to  ensure  currency  and  accuracy.    MAJCOM  representatives  and AETC training personnel will identify and coordinate the career field training requirements.  Using the list of courses in Part II, they will eliminate duplicate training.   13    SECTION B – CAREER PROGRESSION AND INFORMATION 4.  Specialty Description.

Adequate training and timely progression from the apprentice to the  superintendent  level  play  an  important  role  in  the  AF’s  ability  to  accomplish  its  mission.  It  is essential that everyone involved in training must do his or her part to plan, manage, and conduct an effective  training  program.    The  guidance  provided  in  this  part  of  the  CFETP  will  ensure  each individual receives viable training at appropriate points in their career.   5.1.  Apprentice (3)  Level.  Award  of the  3-skill level requires successful  completion  of the initial 15   skills training provided by two consecutive in-resident courses, Phase I & II.  The Cardiopulmonary Lab Apprentice course (Phase I) is located at METC and includes two days of Expeditionary Medical Readiness skills at Joint Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston, Camp Bullis, Texas.  Phase II training is conducted, currently, at six clinical sites throughout the United States.  Upon successful completion of both phases of initial skills training, students will be conferred an Associate’s Degree in Respiratory Therapy (AS/RT) near the end of Phase II.    5.2.  Journeyman (5) Level.  Award of the 5-skill level requires 12 months’ UGT time and begins at the first permanent duty station after Phase II completion.  Individuals in retraining status, Training Status Code (TSC) ‘F’, are subject to the same training requirements and must complete a minimum of 9 months in upgrade training (UGT).  During UGT, trainees work side-by-side with their supervisor and trainers to qualify on all core and duty position tasks.  Through sufficient time and OJT, personnel build their confidence, skills, and abilities, finally becoming fully proficient at their 5-level core tasks and duties.  Once upgraded, 5-skill level personnel are eligible to attend supplemental currency and readiness  training  such  as  CCATT,  EMEDS,  SMART  (Tier  3)  and  C-STARS.  The  journeyman should pursue educational and credentialing opportunities to enhance their careers.   Senior  Airmen (SrA) are eligible to attend Airman Leadership School (ALS).      5.2.1.  EXISTING  REQUIREMENT:    Award  of  CRT  credential  by  the  National  Board  for Respiratory Care is required within 6 months from award of 5-skill level to maintain the 4H051 AFSC, waiverable only by AFCFM.  Specific dates to be awarded the CRT based on Phase I class starts are found in Attachment 5, Phase I Class List with CRT Credential Deadlines.  Failure to do so may result in AFSC disqualification.  Note:  Per CoARC Entry Standards, 1.01, “An educational sponsor must be a post-secondary academic institution  accredited  by  a  regional  or  national  accrediting  agency  that  is  recognized  by  the  U.S. Department  of  Education  (USDE)  and  must  be  authorized  under  applicable  law  or  other  acceptable authority  to  award  graduates  of  the  program  an  associate  or  higher  degree  at  the  completion  of  the program.”  The Cardiopulmonary Laboratory AFSC utilizes the CCAF Associates’ in Applied Sciences Degree  in  Cardiopulmonary  Laboratory  Sciences  to  satisfy  this  requirement,  until  such  time  that  a contract Associates’ in Science Degree in Respiratory Therapy is employed, per 5.2.2.2. below.  5.2.2. Beginning with implementation of new course w/AS in RT degree, date TBD:    5.2.2.1. Cardiopulmonary  Laboratory  students  attending  Phase  II  will  challenge  the  Certified Cardiographic Technician (CCT) exam by the Cardiovascular Credentialing International (CCI) at the end of the Cardiology block of instruction.    5.2.2.2. Near the end of Phase II, students  who pass the course will be conferred an Associate’s in Science Degree in Respiratory Therapy and will challenge the Therapist Multiple Choice (TMC) exam from the National Board for Respiratory Care (NBRC) while still in Phase II.   5.2.2.3. The award of the CRT and the CCT are required for upgrade to the 4H051 AFSC, waiverable only  by  AFCFM.      Maintenance  of  the  CRT  credential  is  required  for  retention  in  AFSCs  4H051, 4H071 and 4H091.  Active Duty only:  Maintenance of the CCT is required for retention in AFSCs 4H051 and 4H071.   5.2.2.4. While the CRT credential is the current minimum standard, the optimal credentialing goal is to attain the Registered Respiratory Therapist (RRT) credential.  Therefore, in an effort to achieve the RRT, a 4H031 in UGT who passed the TMC at the “High Cut” and is registry-eligible will challenge the NBRC’s Clinical Simulation within 6 months of arriving at their first permanent duty station.   5.3.  Craftsman (7)  Level.  Award of the 7-skill level requires a  rank of  Staff  Sergeant (SSgt),  12 16     months UGT time starting from notification of selection for promotion, completion of all core and duty position  tasks,  recommendation  by  the  supervisor  and  approval  by  the  commander.    Individuals  in retraining  status  (TSC  “G”)  are  subject  to  the  same  training  requirements  and  must  complete  a minimum of 6 months in UGT.  The craftsman starts assuming some supervisory responsibilities while still maintaining high levels of primary job proficiency.    5.3.1.  Professional Military Education (PME) is critical to the development of all Airmen, and must be completed in a manner commensurate with their respective ranks.  ALS is required to assume the rank of SSgt.    ALS  curriculum  is  designed  to  develop  a  mindset  and  associated  skills  to  meet  four  graduate attributes:  (1)  expeditionary  Airmen,  (2)  supervisor  of  Airmen,  (3)  military  professional,  and  (4) supervisory communicator.    5.3.2.  Career  progression  beyond  the  SSgt  rank  consists  primarily  of  increasing  supervision  and management responsibilities within the Cardiopulmonary Lab while still performing many of the core tasks of a 5-skill level.  As a Technical Sergeant (TSgt), the member may be in charge of an element with supervisory responsibilities for two or more subsections.  Prior to promotion to Master Sergeant (MSgt), the member must complete an in-residence course at the Noncommissioned Officers Academy.  This course emphasizes leadership training and human resource management to prepare the member to perform at the superintendent level.    5.3.3.  Maintenance  of  the  CRT  (minimum  level  credential)  is  required.    For  Active  Duty  only, maintenance of the CCT is required only for those affected by 5.2.2.3. above, and is highly encouraged for all other 4H071 Airmen who entered the Air Force prior to the start of the CCT mandate and are assigned to Cardiology Services.          5.4.  Superintendent (9) Level.   Award of the 9-skill level requires an individual be a least a SMSgt.  If selected  for  promotion,  completion  of  Senior  Noncommissioned  Officer  Enlisted  PME  is  required prior to assuming the rank of Chief Master Sergeant (CMSgt).  Maintenance of the CRT credential (at a minimum) is required.  6.   Training Decisions.  The CFETP uses a building block approach (simple to complex) to encompass the entire spectrum of training requirements for the Cardiopulmonary Laboratory AFSC.  The spectrum includes a strategy for when, where, and how to meet the training requirements.  The strategy must be apparent and affordable to reduce duplication of training and eliminate a disjointed approach to training.  The 4H0X1 Specialty Training Requirements Team (STRT) meeting held 25-29 January 2016 at Joint Base  San  Antonio—Fort  Sam  Houston,  TX,  laid  the  foundation  for  the  training  requirements  in  this CFETP.  The following key decisions and changes resulted from the STRT:  6.1.  Initial Skills Training.  A great deal of attention was placed on the Specialty Training Standard (STS) line proficiency codes in order to correlate them with those found on the CoARC and  NBRC instructional matrices.  Although this alignment significantly increased the number of “3c” proficiency codes  on  the  STS,  it  does  not  indicate  a  commensurate  increase  in  course  time.    Cardiopulmonary Laboratory Apprentice Course Phase I will require more didactic and lab time, therefore a shift in time from Phase II to Phase I is expected.         6.2.  5-Level Upgrade Requirements.  After discussion regarding the significant disconnect between the current  Cardiopulmonary  Laboratory  education,  training  and  developmental  processes  compared  to    a CoARC-accredited civilian Respiratory Therapy training program, all FMs in attendance signaled their understanding for the need to raise the on-time graduation rate, and most importantly, the graduation-to-certification  ratio  in  order  to  prevent  loss  of  the  USAF  RT  Program’s  accreditation.    The  Functional Community realized that the 2013 AFECD and CFETP did not provide sufficient guidance to achieve these  two  CoARC  program  thresholds.    This  CFETP  contains  specific  guidance  that  close  the  gap between the previous 4H0X1 credentialing processes and existing CoARC requirements.  17  6.3.  7-Level  Upgrade  Requirements.    The  2013  AFECD  and  CFETP  state  “…award  of  Certified Respiratory Therapist Certification by the National Board for Respiratory Care (within 6 months of 5 skill level…”.  No guidance existed in regard to how to manage those beyond 6 months of the 5-skill level.  Through experience, this guidance proved difficult to enforce for myriad reasons.  As discussed above,  the  specific  guidance  in  this  CFETP  addresses  the  credentialing  requirement  for  the  4H0X1 Total Force.    6.4.  Proficiency  Training.    For  4H051  upgrade  training,  the  4H  AFCFM  recommended  the development  and  employment  of  QTPs  in  order  to  standardized  4H  OJT  in  the  AFMS.  Additionally, the 4H AFCFM reemphasized the importance of each 4H0X1 to maintain proficiency and currency in the primary readiness skillset, Respiratory Therapy.  In order to achieve this, the FM  community  must  place  more  focus  on  acquiring  and  maintaining  Training  Affiliation Agreements  and/or  Memorandums  of  Understanding  when  and  where  possible  with medical/trauma centers near their respective bases.   6.5.  Waiver Procedures.  6.5.1.  Waiving  Specialty  Qualification  Requirements.  Qualification  requirements  for  this  specialty are  published  in  the  Air  Force  Enlisted  Classification  Directory  (AFECD)  and  this  CFETP.    These requirements may be for entry, award or retention of the AFS and respective skill level.  However, special circumstances  may  warrant  waiving  these  requisites.  A  waiver  saves  training  resources  without impacting  career  field  progression  or  mission  accomplishment  when  an  individual  possesses qualifications equivalent to the established requirements.  6.5.2.  Evaluating  Waiver  Requests.    Supervisors,  managers  and  leaders  must  compare  each  waiver request  against  predetermined  standards  to  maintain  AFS  integrity.    Consider  task  knowledge, performance,  ability  to  learn  and  transfer  knowledge  to  performance,  and  future  within  the  AFS  in relation to peers.  Requests must consider the following factors:  6.5.2.1.  Education.    Has the individual previously completed  an equivalent  education  or  certification program (or equivalency test), or performed duty in an exceptional manner over an extended period of time in the actual or equivalent AFS or civilian occupation?  6.5.2.2.  Training.  Has  the  individual  completed  an  equivalent  technical  training  course  or  civilian vocational  training  course,  certification  program  (or  equivalency  test),  or  performed  duty  in  an exceptional  manner  over  an  extended  period  of  time  in  the  actual  or  equivalent  AFS  or  civilian occupation?  6.5.2.3.  Knowledge.    Does  the  individual  possess  the  career  knowledge  equivalent  to  current requirements?    Waiver  requests  must  meet  the  mandatory  career  knowledge  topics  identified  in  the specialty description.  6.5.2.4.  Experience.  Has the individual performed duty over an extended period of time in the  actual or equivalent  AFS  or  civilian  occupation?    Supporting  documentation  must  include  proof  of  experience, such  as  performance  reports,  training  records,  state  or  federal  operating  licenses,  certificates  of affiliation, etc.  6.5.2.5.  Other.    Does  the  individual  possess  the  physical  ability,  aptitude,  or  qualifications  that  are equivalent to, or commensurate with, the established requirement?  6.6.  Responsibilities  18    6.6.1.  Individual.    Does the  individual  acknowledge  possessing the  prescribed training requirements?  Trainees  must  understand what their education and training requirements  are, accept  responsibility for training, and document task qualification.  6.6.2.  Supervisor.    Did  the  commander  and  supervisor  fulfill  their  obligations  to  the  trainee  and  the training program?  Level of support or involvement is not, by itself, justification for approving waivers; it may indicate problems in training equity or other areas. 6.6.3.  Training System Equity.  This area relates to circumstances beyond a trainee's control such as the following:  Were training or testing conditions abnormal?  Did the training or testing system provide the best opportunity for successful completion of training requirements?  Was the training or testing system flexible enough to allow for unexpected situations or conditions?  Did those responsible for the training or testing  program  fulfill  their  obligations  effectively?    Depending  on  the  facts,  this  area  may  warrant options other than approving a waiver.  6.7.  Processing  Waiver  Requests.    Process  waiver  requests  according  to  AFI  36-2101,  Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted), AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program.  6.8.  Waiving Scope of Practice Tasks.  Normally, enlisted medical and dental personnel operate within the guidelines established by the CFETP.  The CFETP defines the enlisted scope of practice.  When the MTF  executive  management  team  determines  a  need  for  enlisted  personnel  to  perform  tasks  clearly beyond the expectations of their AFSC, the MAJCOM Surgeon General considers and grants waivers as appropriate.  Consistent with the CFETP review process, these waivers will be reviewed annually.  To request  a  Scope  of  Practice  waiver  to  perform  tasks  not  found  in  the  CFETP,  refer  to  AFI  44-119, Medical Quality Operations.  6.8.1. Waiver requests will include the following:  6.8.1.1.  Rationale for expanding practice to include who and where within the MTF.  6.8.1.2.  Training protocol.  6.8.1.3.  Procedures for competency validation/verification.  6.8.1.4.  Guidelines for maintaining proficiency.  7.  Community College of the Air Force (CCAF).  When assigned to an Air Force career field, active duty, ANG and AFRC enlisted members are admitted to the college and registered in the degree program designed  for  their  Air  Force  specialty.    CCAF  provides  the  opportunity  for  a  Cardiopulmonary Laboratory  Technologist  to  obtain  an  Associate  of  Applied  Sciences  Degree  in  Cardiopulmonary Laboratory Technology.  In addition to its associate’s degree program, CCAF offers the following:  7.1.  CCAF  Instructor  Certification  (CIC)  Program.    CCAF  offers  the  CIC  program  for  qualified instructors who teach CCAF collegiate-level credit awarding courses at a CCAF affiliated school. The CIC is a professional credential that recognizes the instructor’s extensive faculty development training, education and qualification required to teach a CCAF course and formally acknowledges the instructor’s practical experience.  See CCAF Catalog for eligibility requirements.  The CIC Program replaced the CCAF Occupational Instructor Certification (OIC) Program, which officially closed on 1 January 2011.  7.2.  Degree  Completion  Requirements.  The  following  degree  requirements  were  obtained  from  the 2017-2019  CCAF  Catalog.    All  Airmen  are  automatically  entered  into  the  CCAF  program  upon completion  of  BMT.    Prior  to  completing a  CCAF  degree, the  5-skill level  must  be awarded  and the following requirements must be met:  19          Subject  Technical Education.....................................................................................................................................24 Leadership, Management & Military Studies................................................................................................6 Physical Education.........................................................................................................................................4 General Education........................................................................................................................................15 Program Electives.........................................................................................................................................15 Total Requirements....................................................................................................................................64             Semester Hours  7.2.1.  Residency Requirement (16 semester hours).  A student must have a minimum of 16 semester hours of resident CCAF credit applied to his or her degree program to graduate. The 16 semester hours residency requirement is only satisfied by credit earned for coursework completed in a CCAF affiliated school  or  through  CCAF  Specialty  Internship  credit  awarded  for  progression  in  an  Air  Force occupational specialty.  Note:  Proficiency “P” credit and physical education credit awarded for basic military training is not resident credit.   7.2.2.  Technical  Education  Requirement  (24  semester  hours).    24  semester  hours  are  required  to fulfill the technical education requirement.  12 semester hours must be applied from the technical core area  with  the  remaining  12  applied  from  either  the  technical  core  or  the  technical  elective  areas.    A student  can  check  with  the  CCAF  advisor/training  technician  for  advice  regarding  specific  degree requirements and information regarding transfer credit.  Requests to substitute comparable courses or to exceed specified semester-hour values in any subject or course are approved by the Academic Programs Division.  Technical education requirements are generally satisfied by entry-level and advanced degree-applicable  courses  at  affiliated  schools  and  through  Specialty  Internship  credit.  However,  additional technical education requirements may be satisfied by application of courses accepted in transfer, testing credit, distance learning, or issued professional credentials.

The leadership,  management  and  military  studies  (LMMS)  requirement  may  be  satisfied  by  applying professional military education, civilian courses accepted in transfer and/or by testing credit.  However, the  preferred  method  of  fulfilling  the  LMMS  requirement  is  through  attending  Airman  Leadership School, NCO Academy and/or the Air Force Senior NCO Academy.  20  7.2.4.  Physical  Education  Requirement  (4  semester  hours).  Completing  basic  military  training satisfies  the  4-semester-hour  physical  education  requirement.    Civilian  courses  do  not  apply  to  this requirement. 7.2.5.  General  Education  Requirement  (15  semester  hours).  Applicable  courses  must  meet  the criteria for application of courses to the general education requirement and agree with the definitions of applicable  General  Education  subject/courses  as  provided  in  the  CCAF  General  Catalog.    Courses required to satisfy the general education requirement are as follows: Subject/Courses  Oral Communication*.................................................................................................................................3 Speech (*Note:  As of 1 Jan 17, students registered in the 2017-2019 CCAF General Catalog may  complete  6  semester  hours  of  non-duplicative  written  communication  and  no  oral communication, or 3 semester hours of written communication and 3 semester hours of oral communication)         Semester Hours Written Communication*............................................................................................................................3            English Composition     Mathematics................................................................................................................................................3 Intermediate Algebra or a college-level mathematics. Three semester hours of mathematics are  required  for  graduation.

AETC  Instructor  Requirements.    Additional  off-duty  education  is  a  personal  choice  that  is encouraged for all.  Individuals desiring to become an AETC Instructor must possess as a minimum an associate degree or should be actively pursuing an associate degree.  Special Duty Assignment (SDA) requires an AETC instructor candidate to have a CCAF degree or be within one year of completion (45 semester  hours).    A  degreed  faculty  is  necessary  to  maintain  accreditation  through  the  Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.  Furthermore, all Phase II instructors must meet credentialing requirements detailed in the Medical Training Guide (MTG).  7.4.  The  Instructor  of  Technology  and  Military  Science  (ITMS)  degree  program.      The  ITMS degree is available to the 4H0X1 career field personnel who are assigned or previously assigned to an instructor  “T”  prefix  at  the  Cardiopulmonary  Laboratory  Schoolhouse.    Applicants  must  complete  3 21 semester hours of CCAF approved instructor methodology coursework and hold their career field-related CCAF degree or equivalent civilian college degree before registration.  If the instructor methodology credit earned in the apprentice course is applied to the Cardiopulmonary Laboratory Technology degree, it cannot be used for the ITMS degree.  Technicians have the option of using the credits for this course in either of the two degrees available.  The journeyman (5) level (or fully qualified equivalent) must be held at the time of program completion.  Registrants must complete the program within two years from initial date of registration and have a documented 12 semester hours (180 contact hours) CCAF Teaching Internship transcribed.    7.5.  Professional Credential.  The term “Credential” refers to professional certifications, licensures or registries.    CCAF  degree  technical  and/or  program  elective  requirements  may  be  satisfied  by  credit awarded  for  specific  national  professional  credentials.

The purpose is to verify competencies  focusing  on  the  individual’s  currency  and  proficiency  in  selected  STS  line  items.    The supervisor’s assessment of an individual’s knowledge, proficiency and currency levels are essential in order to fully and successfully reintegrate Airmen into the role of 4H0X1 after extended time away from the tasks and work practices.  If individual’s CRT lapsed during service outside of the 4H0X1 AFSC, it must be re-achieved w/in a year of reintegration.   12.  4H091 Requalification.  Individuals returning to the career field in the rank of SMSgt or above do not have to meet the above requalification standards, however, they must regain the CRT credential if it lapsed during their time away from the 4H AFSC.                29     SECTION D – RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS 13. Purpose.  This section identifies known resource constraints, which preclude optimal and desired training  from  being  developed  or  conducted,  including  information  such  as  cost  and  manpower.  Narrative explanations of each resource constraint and an impact statement describing what effect each constraint has on training are included.  Also included in this section are actions required, office of primary  responsibility,  and  target  completion  dates.  Resource  constraints  will  be,  as  a  minimum, reviewed and updated annually.  14. Reporting Job Proficiency Training Constraints - Units/MAJCOMS.  14.1.  Supervisors should report known resource constraints that prevent personnel from completing the mandatory  training  requirements  specified  in  this  plan,  to  their  unit-level  enlisted  specialty  training manager.  The authority for requesting waivers is AFI 36-2101.   14.2.   In the report, provide a brief description of the resource constraints which adversely affect the training program and include the impact this constraint has or will have on training.  Identify the specific STS  line  item  and  task  code(s)  affected.    Also,  provide  a  brief  description  of  the  resource  needs  to resolve the problem, including expenses, the corrective actions taken or to be taken, and the estimated completion date.   14.3.   If the constraint may be resolved at the local level, the report will be coordinated with the senior 4H0X1,  and  if  the  impact  affects  unit  war  skill  requirements,  the  group  CC.    If  the  constraint  needs MAJCOM support, forward the report through your MDG/CC to the 4H0X1 MFM.  Constraints that cannot be resolved at the unit or MAJCOM level, or have a long term estimated completion date, must be forwarded to the 4H0X1 AFCFM as a request for waiver or deferment of CFETP requirements. 15. Apprentice Level Training Constraints:  All Cardiopulmonary Lab Phase II sites must be able to meet a minimum of 200 actual ventilated patient care contact hours per student.    15.1.1.  Evaluation and analysis of each Phase II site is required to determine in-house capabilities, to include access to appropriate patient volume and acuity levels.  If not able to support the desired patient contact requirement, implement action to establish Memorandums of Understanding (MOU) or Training Affiliation Agreements (TAA) with other medical facilities.    15.1.2.  Coordinate  efforts  with  USAF  RT  Program  Key  Personnel,  MFM  and  AFCFM.      OPR:  Affected 4H MFMs, targeted completion date of 30 Sep 17.  15.2.  Journeyman and Craftsman Level Training Constraints:  IAW AFI 41-106, 4H0X1 MFMs must  evaluate  each  base  in  their  respective  MAJCOMs  to  determine  what  gaps  in  training  exist  in relation to the 4H0X1 CMRP.    15.2.1. If the base is unable to meet 4H0X1 CMRP requirements, the MFM will, where possible, work with  local  unit  leadership  to  establish  and  implement  an  MOU/TAA  with  a  level  I  (preferable)  or  II medical facility.  15.2.2. MFMs  will coordinate efforts to attain MOUs/TAAs to  meet  CMRP requirements  with the 4H AFCFM.   OPR:  Affected 4H MFMs, targeted completion date of 30 Sep 17.   30 SECTION E – TRANSITIONAL TRAINING GUIDE There are currently no transition training requirements.  This area is reserved. 31   PART II SECTION A – SPECIALTY TRAINING STANDARD (STS) FOR AFSC 4H0X1 1.  Implementation.  This STS will be used for Cardiopulmonary Apprentice technical training provided by AETC with classes beginning no later than 1 Oct 17.  Training documentation will be accomplished in  the  web-based  AF  Training  Record  (AFTR),  accessible  from  the  AF  Portal  via  the  Advanced Distributed Learning System (ADLS) link. 2.  Purpose.  As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, this STS includes: 2.1.  Section 1 (Task, Knowledge, and Technical Reference).  The most common tasks, knowledge, and technical references (TR) necessary for Airmen to perform duties in the 3-, 5-, and 7-skill levels.  TRs in the source summary are commercial publications or other service publications that are essential for OJT and mission accomplishment and are referenced by title throughout the STS.  The unit OJT section will consolidate the requirements  for  the  unit supported  and  order publications  through  the  hospital/clinic library activity.  TRs listed in Column 1 and in the bibliography (Attachment 4) are approved for use in formal course and MTP development.    2.2.  Section 2.  Tasks designated with a "5" or a "7" are Core Tasks for 5- or 7-level UGT respectively. During OJT, Core Tasks are to be trained and evaluated to the "Go" level.   2.3.  Section 3 provides certification data for OJT.  Column A is used to record training start dates; column B is used to record completion of tasks and knowledge training requirements.  Columns C, D and E are used to record the initials for trainees, trainers, and certifiers (if needed), respectively.  Task certification must show a certification or completion date. 2.3.1.   The Cardiopulmonary Laboratory AFCFM has determined that the following tasks will require a Third-Party Task Certifier during OJT/UGT:  2.3.1.1. All duty position-specific STS line items identified on the Master Task List (MTL; see Section F) taught to the “C” or “3c” level in Phase II.  Initial qualification for upgrade to 4H051 will also include:     2.3.1.1.1. Cardiopulmonary Career Field  2.3.1.1.2. Safety in the Cardiopulmonary Environment  2.3.1.1.3. Resource Management  2.3.1.1.4. Administrative Functions  2.3.1.1.5. Fundamentals of Patient Care  2.3.1.1.6. Patient Data Evaluation and Recommendations  2.3.1.1.7. Blood Gases  2.3.1.1.8. Emergency Care Procedures  2.3.1.1.9. Respiratory Care.  Exclude line item 11.4.8., Mechanical Ventilation at Altitude.  Where other training deficiencies exist, document IAW guidance in AFI 36-2201. 32         2.3.1.1.10. Pharmacology  2.3.1.3.  For  all  other  line  items  identified  on  the  MTL,  the  AFCFM  defers  the  Third-Party  Task Certifier requirement to the local 4H0X1 leadership level.  2.4.  Section 4 specifies the level of training provided by the 3-skill level resident  Cardiopulmonary Laboratory Phase I and Phase II courses.  2.5.  Section 5.  For the majority of line items identified on the MTL, the supervisor, trainer, certifier, etc.,  will  validate  the  upgrade  trainee’s  competency.    This  will  be  accomplished  by  use  of  (but  not limited to) the QTPs listed, and/or commercially available/locally developed competency assessment checklists.   2.6.  Use the automated training management  system, AF Training Record (AFTR), to document technician qualifications. 2.7.  Qualitative  Requirements.    Attachment  2  contains  the  proficiency code  key  used  to  indicate  the level of training and knowledge provided by the resident training courses. 2.8.  Job Qualification Standard.  The STS becomes a Job Qualification Standard (JQS) for on-the-job training when placed in AF Form 623, Individual Training Record, and used according to AFI 36-2201.  Refer  to  this  AFI  for  further  guidance  on  documentation,  transcribing,  certification,  decertification  and recertification.  When used as a JQS, the following requirements apply: 2.6.1. Documentation  of  Initial  Training.    When  documenting  in  AFTR,  ensure  to  complete  the following:  Training Start, Training Complete, Trainee Initials, Trainer Initials and Certifier Initials.   2.6.2. Decertification and Recertification.  When a supervisor determines an Airman is disqualified on a task previously certified for their duty position, the supervisor deletes certification in AFTR. Appropriate remarks  pertaining  to  the  reason  for  decertification  are  entered  on  the  AF  Form  623a,  On-The-Job-Training Record-Continuation Sheet.  2.9. Training Standard.  Tasks are trained and qualified to the “go” or “no go” level.  "Go" means the individual can perform the task without assistance and meets local requirements for accuracy, timeliness, and correct procedures.  “Go” level equates to “3c” in the STS proficiency code key. 2.10.  Specialty  Training  Standard.    Guide  for  development  of  promotion  tests  used  in  the  Weighted Airman  Promotion  System  (WAPS).  4H0X1  Specialty  Knowledge  Tests  are  developed  at  the  AETC Occupational Measurement Squadron by SNCOs with extensive practical experience in their career field.  The test samples knowledge of STS subject matter areas judged by test development team members as most appropriate for promotion to higher grades.  Questions are based upon study references listed in the Enlisted Promotions References and Requirements Catalog available on MyPers.   3.  Deployment  Tasks.    The  4H  AFCFM  has  recommended  that  4H0X1  personnel  train  on  the task/knowledge  items  listed  in  Table  A—Deployment  Task  Listing  (as  they  pertain  to  4H  Readiness requirements) prior to a deployment.  Upon notification of a UTC tasking, personnel should refer to this list and arrange to complete their CMRP requirements.  4H leadership should optimize training opportunities utilizing SMART Tier 1-3 concepts:  Tier 1—Internal training sources, to include hands-on and/or skills labs/locally-developed  equivalents;  Tier  2—MOUs/TAAs  for  access  to  hands-on  patient  care;  Tier  3—SMART (currently only at Nellis AFB) or C-STARS training platforms in Baltimore and St Louis.    33          Table A.

(Principles) Can analyze facts and principles and draw conclusions about the subject.  (Analysis) Can evaluate conditions and make proper decisions about the subject.  (Evaluation) Explanations * A  task knowledge scale value may be used alone or with a task performance scale value to define a level of knowledge for a specific task.  (Example:  b and 1b) ** A subject knowledge scale value is used alone to define a level of knowledge for a subject not directly related to any specific task, or for a subject common to several tasks.  This mark is used alone instead of a scale value to show that no proficiency training is provided in the course. X   This mark is used alone in the course columns to show that training is required but not given due to limitations in resources. Note:   All tasks and knowledge items shown with a proficiency code are trained during wartime.        36       Attachment 3   Cardiopulmonary Laboratory (4H0X1) STS 1.

Course Objectives for Initial Skills Course.  To obtain a copy of a COL, contact:  383 TRS/TRR Training Development Element  3480 Garden Avenue Joint Base San Antonio—Fort Sam Houston TX 78234 Phone:  DSN 420-5157 or Commercial:  (210) 808-5157  6.  Measurement.  Each proficiency coded task or knowledge item taught at the technical school is measured using an objective.  An objective is a written instruction for the students so they know what is expected of them to successfully complete training on each task or knowledge item.  Each objective is composed of a condition, behavior and a standard. The condition is the setting in which the training takes place (i.e., type of equipment or references, etc.).  The behavior is the observable portion of the objective (i.e., perform hand washing, etc.).  The standard is the level of performance that is measured to ensure the proficiency code level is attained (e.g., to a 70% or with no instructor assists).  All objectives use a progress check (PC) or written test (W) or a combination of both to measure a student’s ability (skill) or knowledge.  7.  Standard.  The minimum standard for written examinations is 70%.  The standard for performance objectives (skills) vary and are indicated in the objective and the performance checklist.  The instructor documents each student’s progress during skills evaluations with the use of a checklist.  Students must satisfactorily complete all progress checks prior to taking a written test.  8.   Proficiency Level.  Key personnel at the Cardiopulmonary Laboratory Schoolhouse correlated the preponderance of 4H STS task proficiency codes with the CoARC and NBRC teaching matrices.  As a result, most task performance must be taught to the “3c” proficiency level.  This indicates that students can do all parts of the task and only need a spot check of completed work (competent), and they can identify why and when the tasks must be done and why each step is needed (operating principles).  9.  Initial Medical Readiness Training. As directed by AFI 41-106, initial medical readiness training is provided within  the Expeditionary Medical Readiness Course (EMRC), which is conducted at 59th Training Group, Camp Bullis, TX.  The EMRC course occurs during the Cardiopulmonary Apprentice Phase I Course.  Completed training is documented on AETC Form 15, Student Training Report (or computer-generated student report) for each course attendee.  Sustainment Medical Readiness Training for the individual is the responsibility of each medical facility.  10.  Advanced Skills Course.  There is currently no advanced course.  This area is reserved.   53   SECTION C – SUPPORT MATERIALS:  The following list of support materials is not all-inclusive; however, it covers the most frequently referenced areas:  11.

Work Center Training Plan.  The purpose of this section is to provide guidelines and examples of proper documentation for the many electronic forms used in training of all enlisted medical personnel.  Training documentation  helps to assess readiness capability as well as individual strengths and weaknesses.  It also aids compliance with internal and external regulating agencies.  The enlisted training documentation is performed in the AF Training Record.  AFTR is accessible from the ADLS via the AF Portal, and it serves as the single, automated repository for all medical enlisted specialty training.  Refer to your Unit Training Manager for the most current policies and guidance on training documentation.  14.1.  Master Training Plan (MTP).  14.1.1   An MTP is a reference guide developed for each section that includes all facets of training for individuals assigned.   It is used as a reference source for the type of training and training documentation that occurs with each assigned member.  The MTP is used to standardize training and to give trainers, trainees, supervisors, and noncommissioned officers in charge an overview of the training process for the duty section.  Training managers will implement the MTP into AFTR.  14.1.2.  The MTP is an overview of training for the duty section.  It should include all information involved in the training  process for the duty section.  Training will vary from section to section and person to person.  However, certain documents will be a standard requirement for all MTPs.  They are listed below:  14.1.2.1. Master Task List (MTL).  The MTL identifies all day-to-day mission (duty position) requirements, core tasks, local and contingency tasks, and additional duties performed by work center personnel.  14.1.2.2. Current CFETP or AFJQS (if available).  14.1.2.3. If applicable, locally-developed AF Form 797, Job Qualification Standard Continuation/Command JQS (accessible in AFTR), and AF Form 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training.  14.1.2.4. Unit-Specific Orientation Checklist  14.1.2.5. Job Descriptions/Performance Standards 14.1.2.6. QTPs required to perform peacetime/wartime duties.    14.1.2.7. 4H0X1 Airmen will upload a copy of their degree and credential(s) into their AFTR.    14.1.2.8. Recommendation:  Each MTP should have an official memorandum from the work center supervisor addressing key issues peculiar to the work center and implementation of the MTP.  59                                                  VARIOUS Note 2 20131104 Note 3 20140106 20140224 20140428 20140616 20140804 20140922 20141112 20150122 20150311 20150506 20150624 20150819 20151009 20151209 20160208 20160406 20160523 20160720 20160908 20161017 20161205 20170206 20170403 20170522 20170717 20170905 7-Aug-07  thru  23-Sep-13 4-Nov-13 6-Jan-14 24-Feb-14 28-Apr-14 16-Jun-14 4-Aug-14 22-Sep-14 12-Nov-14 22-Jan-15 11-Mar-15 6-May-15 24-Jun-15 19-Aug-15 9-Oct-15 9-Dec-15 8-Feb-16 6-Apr-16 23-May-16 20-Jul-16 8-Sep-16 17-Oct-16 5-Dec-16 6-Feb-17 3-Apr-17 22-May-17 17-Jul-17 5-Sep-17 VARIOUS 4-Nov-15 6-Jan-16 24-Feb-16 28-Apr-16 16-Jun-16 4-Aug-16 22-Sep-16 11-Nov-16 22-Jan-17 11-Mar-17 8-Sep-17 24-Oct-17 19-Dec-17 9-Feb-18 9-Apr-18 8-Jun-18 6-Aug-18 23-Sep-18 20-Nov-18 8-Jan-19 17-Feb-19 5-Apr-19 6-Jun-19 3-Aug-19 22-Sep-19 17-Nov-19 5-Jan-20 Phase I Class List with CRT Credential Deadlines Attachment 5 CoARC Class Number Phase I Class Graduation Date        (Calculated) VARIOUS Note 1  Before 7-Aug-07  VARIOUS Enrollment Date  (Phase I, Day of Training 1) Must Hold CRT Credential No Later Than 31-Dec-17 + *  31-Dec-17 31-May-17 31-May-17 31-May-17 31-May-17 31-May-17 31-May-17 31-May-17 31-May-17 31-Jul-17 30-Sep-17 31-Mar-18 30-Apr-18 30-Jun-18 31-Aug-18 31-Oct-18 31-Dec-18 28-Feb-19 31-Mar-19 31-May-19 31-Jul-19 31-Aug-19 31-Oct-19 31-Dec-19 29-Feb-20 31-Mar-20 31-May-20 31-Jul-20          Note 1:  Entry and Certificate-Level Courses starting before 7 Aug 07.
