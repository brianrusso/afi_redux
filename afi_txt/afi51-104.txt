Enlisted  Paralegals  have  been  an  indispensable  part  of  the  Air  Force  Judge Advocate  General’s  Corps  (AFJAGC)  for  more  than  55  years.  Today,  enlisted  paralegals proudly serve as American Airmen and use their in-depth legal skills and training to partner with Judge  Advocates  in  providing  commanders  and  warfighters  full  spectrum  legal  support.    From the beginning, the Air Force paralegal designation has signified pride and accomplishment in a demanding  but  rewarding  discipline.   Under  the  supervision  of  an  attorney,  paralegals  perform substantive  legal  work  that  requires  knowledge,  recognition,  evaluation,  organization,  analysis, and  communication  of  relevant  facts  and  legal  concepts.    Paralegals  perform  legal  research  by reviewing  and  analyzing  available  precedents  and  make  final  legal  recommendations  for  the Staff Judge Advocate or other senior attorney. 1.1.1.  Prior to 1955, Air Force paralegals were administrative specialists who carried letters which  identified  them  as  legal  specialists.   In  May  1955,  paralegals  were  recognized  as  a separate career field with their own Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC), 705X0, with the title of Legal Services Specialist.  Progress continued to be made towards a distinct identity when in 1979 the Community College of the Air Force recognized the unique nature of the career field  by  approving  an  Associate  Degree  program  for  paralegals,  later  validated  by  the American  Bar  Association.    It  wasn’t  until  a  few  years  later,  in  1988  that  recognition  as  a Paralegal was official with an 881X0 AFSC.  In 1991 the AFSC changed again to the present day 5J0X1. 1.1.2.  The paralegal occupational badge was approved in 1994.  The insignia consists of the scales  of  justice  with  quills  and  was  taken  from  the  Air  Force  judge  advocate  badge.   The scales of justice represent  the military legal  system,  through which the Air Force maintains good  order  and  discipline.   The  scales  also  highlight  the  common  critical  link  between  the paralegal and the judge advocate.  The quill has long symbolized the scribe or tools by which the written word is produced.  The quills are crossed and rest under the base of the scales of justice  to  symbolize  the  essential  support  of  the  Air  Force  legal  system  by  our  paralegal force. 1.2.

Vectors  will  not  identify  a  specific  location  of assignment. AFI51-104  18 FEBRUARY 2016 17 Chapter 5 PARALEGAL DUTY TITLES 5.1.  Paralegal Duty Titles.  When properly applied, duty titles facilitate a quick understanding of a person’s role and level of responsibility.  Paralegal duty titles are assigned based upon the scope  of  responsibility  and  the  duties  being  performed.    A  consistent,  standard  approach  is important  to  ensure  the  terms  are  meaningful.    Supervisors  must  comply  with  AFI  36-2618, Enlisted Force Structure, Chapter 7, and must use the following authorized duty titles for the paralegal career field.  (T-3) 5.1.1.  Manager:  Used for SNCOs and NCOs who are program, project, and policy managers at NAF, MAJCOM, DRU, FOA, Joint Staff, or Air Staff levels.  They may or may not have personnel  working  for  them  and  may  be  the  enlisted  leader  of  the  branch,  division,  or directorate  (for  example,  Defense  Paralegal  Manager;  NAF  Paralegal  Manager;  and MAJCOM Legal Office Manager). Manager cannot be used at wing-level. 5.1.2.  Superintendent:    Used  for  SNCOs  in  charge  of  group-  or  wing-level  functions  or functions  within  a  squadron  having  either  oversight  of  functions  within  other  squadrons  or within the same squadron.  Only SNCOs will hold the duty title of Superintendent. 5.1.3.  Legal Office/Center/Section NCOIC:  Used for SNCOs and NCOs in charge of wing-level  functions,  work  centers  or  elements.    Generally,  you  may  not  have  a  LOS  and  an NCOIC  of  the  Legal  Office  in  the  same  office.    In  some  large  legal  offices,  there  is  the potential need for both a Superintendent and NCOIC of the Legal Office; this should be an exception and not the rule.  This exception must be approved by the MFM.  For example, if a  SNCO  Superintendent  of  a  Legal  office  requires  the  full  time  assistance  of  an  NCO  to manage the legal office and that is  their  primary  duty, then the appropriate title would be NCOIC  of  the  Legal  Office.    If  the  second  ranking  NCO  is  dual-hatted  with  assisting  the Superintendent  but  their  primary  responsibilities  are  as  NCOIC,  General  Law,  then  an appropriate  title  is  NCOIC,  General  Law.    The  title  “Assistant  NCOIC”  is  prohibited.    See paragraph 5.2 below. 5.1.4.  Section Paralegal.  Used for airmen and NCOs who are assigned to a specific section, reflecting  the  area  of  primary  responsibility  (for  example,  Military  Justice  Paralegal  or General Law Paralegal) 5.2.  Duty  Titles  and  Promotion.  A  common  misconception  among  paralegals  is  that  a  duty title  alone  bears  significant  weight  in  the  promotion  process.    It  is  expected  that  a  particular position may give a paralegal a certain scope of increased responsibility.  However, the title in which  that  paralegal  bears  does  nothing  for  promotion  if  the  content  of  a  performance  report does not demonstrate the initiative and responsibility commensurate with that rank and position.  For  example,  the  title  NCOIC  brings  an  expectation  of  initiative,  process  change/improvement and  leadership,  among  other  qualities.    If  a  performance  report  reflects  day  to  day accomplishments  without  the  added  performance  expected  of  a  leader,  the  title  alone  will  not lead to promotion and could actually detract from the desired promotion goal.  A paralegal that takes any position they are assigned to and magnifies the responsibilities with evaluation, change and  improvement,  initiative  in  perceived  inadequate  processes,  demonstrated  leadership,  and 18 AFI51-104  18 FEBRUARY 2016 takes full advantage of leadership opportunities, no matter how small, will likely find themselves promoted even if their title just says “Paralegal.” AFI51-104  18 FEBRUARY 2016 19 Chapter 6 RETRAINING 6.1.  Entry  into  the  AFSC.  Paralegals  are  selected  from  basic  training  recruits,  retraining volunteers  and  non-volunteers,  and  from  Airmen  disqualified  from  other  career  fields.

Retraining  Process.  Official  retraining  guidance  is  available  on  the  AFPC  Enlisted Retraining  Advisory  website  for  active  duty  Airmen.    Procedures  for  ARC  retrainee’s  are outlined  in  AFI  51-802,  Management  of  the  Judge  Advocate  General’s  Corps  Reserve.  The official  paralegal  retraining  checklist  and  AFPC  recommendation  letter  is  available  at  the  Air Force Judge Advocate General’s Corps AF/JAX CAPSIL site under paralegal Retraining. 6.2.1.  SJAs and LOSs/NCOICs must actively evaluate an individual using the whole person concept. (T-1) As part of the retraining interview process, they must verify the member meets the minimum retraining requirements found in the AFECD.  (T-2)  Additionally, they must review  Enlisted  Performance  Reports,  talk  to  current  and  relevant  supervisors  and  raters, additional raters, First Sergeants, Commanders and anyone deemed necessary to synchronize the individual with their records.  (T-2) 6.2.2.  Through  the  NAF,  if  applicable,  the  MFM  must  review  all  active  duty  retraining packages  and  recommend  either  approval  or  disapproval.    The  MFM  will  inform  the MAJCOM  SJA  of  retraining  application  approvals  and  denials.    For  NCORP  Phase  II disapprovals,  or  in  any  case  of  disagreement  between  the  LOS/NCOIC  and  MFM’s recommendation, the MFM will forward the retraining recommendation letter to the AFCFM for decision.  The decision, either by MFM or AFCFM, will be returned to the LOS/NCOIC, who will then return the decision letter to the member and/or FSS for processing. 20 AFI51-104  18 FEBRUARY 2016 Chapter 7 SELECTION TO THE AFSC 7.1.  Upon approval of the MFM into the AFSC, the active duty retrainee shall provide the retraining  recommendation  letter  to  AFPC  through  their  managing  FSS.  If  retraining quotas  are  available,  AFPC  will  load  the  member  for  a  3-level,  Paralegal  Apprentice  Course (PAC) date. 7.2.  After  successful  completion  of  PAC,  students  are  awarded  the  5J031  skill  level, assigned  to  a  wing-level  legal  office,  enrolled  in  the  5-level  Career  Development  Course (CDC),  and  entered  into  upgrade  training  via  the  Training  Business  Area  (TBA.  )  Members possessing a 3-skill level are not assigned to Air Staff, MAJCOM Staff, other paralegal special  duty  positions  or  to  locations  with  only  one  paralegal  authorization  without  AFCFM approval. 7.3.  The  LOS/NCOIC  must  ensure  the  active  duty  retrainee  has  an  Assignment Availability  Code  (AAC)  of  29  upon  reporting  to  a  legal  office.  (T-2)    If  not  already completed  upon  the  retrainee’s  arrival,  this  code  can  be  accomplished  on  an  AF  IMT  2096, Classification/On-the-job  Training  Action,  with  a  start  date  of  the  trainee’s  graduation  from PAC; it will remain in effect until the trainee upgrades to a skill level commensurate with their rank but not to exceed 24 months.  This does not apply to Basic Trainee accessions. AFI51-104  18 FEBRUARY 2016 21 Chapter 8 WITHDRAWAL/DISQUALIFICATION OF THE PARALEGAL AIR FORCE SPECIALTY CODE (AFSC) 8.1.

This  knowledge  is  essential  for  paralegals  to  function competently  and  with  integrity,  to  be  alert  to  potential  ethical  dilemmas,  and  be  able  to develop a framework for ethical decision making. 11.1.2.  A  paralegal  is  bound  to  comply  with  high  standards  of  professional  behavior primarily because the attorney for whom the paralegal works is responsible for any lapses in the  paralegal’s  behavior.      Attorneys  have  a  vested  interest  in  a  paralegal’s  conduct,  skills, education and decision making.  Key areas of focus include and are discussed below, but are not  limited  to;  Unauthorized  practice  of  law,  confidentiality,  conflicts  of  interest,  and misconduct. 11.2.  Unauthorized Practice of Law.  Only attorneys are authorized to practice law.  Paralegals shall  not  provide  any  legal  advice  to  a  client,  or  render  any  other  services  to  a  client  that constitute the practice of law unless under the direct supervision of an Air Force attorney.  (T-0) Paralegals  will  always  clearly  indicate  their  status  as  a  paralegal  in  all  professional communications to avoid misunderstandings and misconceptions about the paralegal’s roles and responsibilities.  (T-1) 11.3.  Confidentiality.  Paralegals  shall  be  aware  of  and  abide  by  the  rules  of  confidentiality.  (T-1) This includes, but is not limited to, the responsibility to protect personal information, For Official  Use  Only  (FOUO)  information,  and  attorney-client  discussions.    Paralegals  are  in  a trusted position.  Any use of confidential information either to the disadvantage of a client, or to the advantage of themselves or any other person is a serious breach of that trust and is grounds for  possible  disciplinary  action.    Paralegals  shall  not  engage  in  indiscreet  and  irresponsible conversations concerning clients or legal office business outside of those with the need to know.  (T-0) Confidential information may be revealed only after full disclosure and written consent of the  client,  if  required  by  law  or  court  order;  or,  when  necessary  to  prevent  a  client  from committing  an  act  that  could  result  in  death  or  serious  bodily  harm.    A  paralegal  shall  consult with their Air Force supervisory attorney before disclosing confidential information under one of these conditions. (T-1) 32 AFI51-104  18 FEBRUARY 2016 11.4.  Conflicts  of  Interest.  A  paralegal  shall  act  within  the  bounds  of  the  law,  solely  for  the benefit  of  the  client,  whether  an  individual  or  the  United  States,  and  shall  be  free  of compromising influences and loyalties. (T-0) Potential conflicts such as the paralegal’s personal or business interest, previous assignments, family relationships, or other matters a paralegal has worked on must be avoided.  (T-0) If a conflict of interest, whether real or perceived, has been identified,  a  paralegal  must  remove  him/herself  from  any  participation  or  work  on  the  matter unless  full  disclosure  to  the  client  has  been  made  and  their  consent  has  been  given.  (T-0)    A paralegal  shall  first  consult  with  their  Air  Force  supervisory  attorney  to  determine  whether  a conflict exists. (T-1) 11.5.  Misconduct.  Misconduct is defined as UCMJ violations but also includes violations of a paralegal’s professional responsibilities or ethical code and will be handled appropriately. 11.6.  Roster through FLITE.  FLITE, also known as TJAG’s Home Page provides the Corps a means  to  efficiently  provide  legal  information  and  productivity  tools  to  the  DoD  legal community and other authorized government clients in a reliable, user-friendly medium.  Within this  website,  Roster  contains  TAFJAGC  personnel’s  professional  and  personal  information which  allows  communication  throughout  the  Corps.    Paralegals  are  responsible  for  their  own information and must ensure it is complete, correct, and current (within 30 days of change) at all times.    This  includes,  but  is  not  limited  to,  a  current  biography  with  accompanying  current official  photo,  current  assignment  address,  contact  emails/phone  numbers,  education,  training, EPR information, deployments, etc.  An annual data certification is required in FLITE.
