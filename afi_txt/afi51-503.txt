General  Considerations.  Department  of  Defense  Instruction  (DoDI)  6055.07,  Mishap Notification,  Investigation,  Reporting,  and  Record  Keeping,  requires  each  Department  of Defense  (DoD)  component  to  conduct  safety  and  legal  investigations  for  accidental  deaths, certain  injuries,  occupational  illness,  and  property  damage.    Each  Military  Department  uses different  terminology  to  refer  to  legal  investigations.    The  Air  Force  uses  the  term  “accident” investigation, the Army uses the term “legal accident” investigation, and the Navy uses the term “JAGMAN” investigation.  Air Force accident investigations are separate from and independent of  Air  Force  safety  investigations.    Accident  investigations  are  conducted  by  accident investigation boards (AIB) for aerospace accidents and by ground accident investigation boards (GAIB)  for  ground  accidents,  while  safety  investigations  are  conducted  by  safety  investigation boards  (SIB).    An  accident  investigation  consists  of  a  board  president,  legal  advisor,  and  other board members as required or necessary.  The board president is responsible for the contents of the report.  It is vital that no action compromises or creates the perception of a compromise to the integrity  of  the  accident  investigation.    The  terms  “accident”  and  “mishap”  are  used interchangeably throughout this publication. 1.2.  Purpose of Accident Investigations. 1.2.1.  An  accident  investigation  conducts  a  legal  investigation  to  inquire  into  all  the  facts and  circumstances  surrounding  Air  Force  aerospace  and  ground  accidents,  to  prepare  a publicly-releasable report, to obtain and preserve all available evidence for use in litigation, claims, disciplinary action, and adverse administrative action. 1.2.1.1.  Accident  investigations  pursuant  to  this  publication  are  only  authorized  to investigate occurrences that meet the definition of “accident” as defined in Attachment 1.  Other  occurrences  not  meeting  the  definition  of  accident  in  this  publication  may  be investigated  by  a  commander-directed  investigation  (CDI)  or  other  type  of  legal investigation, and can use this publication as a reference, but shall not be referred to as an “accident investigation,” and will not  reference this  publication as a source of  authority for the investigation. 1.2.2.  Accident investigation reports are: 1.2.2.1.  Provided  and  personally  briefed  to  the  next-of-kin  (NoK)  of  military  and civilians killed and to individuals seriously injured in the accident. 1.2.2.2.  Written to be publicly-releasable reports and released to members of the public, media, Congress, and government agencies upon request. 1.2.2.3.  Used  to  assist  in  adjudicating  claims  or  contracts  in  favor  of  or  against  the United States that result from the accident. 1.2.2.4.  Used to assist in defending litigation against the United States that results from the accident. 1.2.2.5.  Used as a source document for commanders. 1.3.  Scope of Accident Investigations.   8  AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015 1.3.1.  The  AIB  investigates  and  reports  on  the  facts  of  the  mishap  and  the  cause(s)  of  the mishap  and/or  factor(s)  that  substantially  contributed  to  it.    The  GAIB  investigates  and reports the facts of the mishap, but does not report the cause(s) or factor(s) that substantially contributed to it unless a Statement of Opinion has been authorized by the Claims and Tort Litigation Division, Air Force Legal Operations Agency (AFLOA/JACC).  In both cases, the board investigates unit deficiencies and other matters only to the extent they are relevant to the mishap. 1.3.2.  Matters  not  found  to  be  relevant  to  the  mishap  and  not  otherwise  required  to  be documented in the report by this publication should be referred in writing, separate from the report, to the staff judge advocate (SJA) of the convening authority (CA).  See Chapter 4. 1.3.3.  Accident  investigations  are  not  criminal  investigations;  therefore,  if  after  consulting with  the legal  advisor, the board president determines the board has uncovered information that may indicate criminal activity, he/she must, via the legal advisor, notify the CA’s SJA as soon as possible in order to determine if the accident investigation shall be suspended and a criminal investigation initiated. 1.4.  Safety Investigations. 1.4.1.  Safety investigations are separate and distinct from accident investigations.  A safety investigation  is  conducted  pursuant  to  Air  Force  Instruction  (AFI)  91-204,  Safety Investigations Reports.  Safety investigations and reports are conducted and written solely to prevent future mishaps.  Except for unusual cases, such as suspected causal criminal activity, safety  investigations  take  priority,  both  in  sequence  and  access  to  evidence,  over  any corresponding legal investigations. 1.4.2.  Privileged safety information. 1.4.2.1.  Privileged  safety  information  refers  to  information  that  is  exempt  from disclosure  outside  the  safety  community.    The  military  safety  privilege  is  judicially recognized and protects  the investigative process.  The Air Force treats this information as  limited  use/limited  access.    The  safety  privilege  ensures  commanders  obtain  critical information  expeditiously  during  a  safety  investigation  and  ensures  completed  final reports  are  protected,  thereby  proactively  promoting  safety,  combat  readiness,  and mission accomplishment. 1.4.2.2.  Privileged safety information includes: 1.4.2.2.1.  Findings,  conclusions,  causes,  recommendations,  other  findings  and recommendations  of  significance,  analysis,  and  the  deliberative  process  of  safety investigators.  This  includes draft versions of the above material  and notes taken by safety investigators in the course of their investigation, whether they are incorporated either directly or by reference, in the final safety report. 1.4.2.2.2.  Information  given  to  safety  investigators  pursuant  to  a  promise  of confidentiality and any information derived from that information to include direct or indirect references to that information. 1.4.2.2.3.  Computer  generated  animations,  simulations,  or  simulator  reenactments; diagrams  and  exhibits;  photographs,  imagery,  and  animations;  and  Life  Sciences AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015   9  material in which safety investigator analysis or privileged testimony is incorporated or the deliberative process of the board is revealed. liability  determinations,  or 1.4.2.3.  The  Air  Force  cannot  use  privileged  safety  information  for  line-of-duty determinations,  claims  adjudication,  flying  evaluation  board  hearings  or  reviews, pecuniary in  any  civil,  criminal,  or  administrative proceedings.    Access  to  privileged  safety  information  is  limited  to  those with  a  need  to know for mishap prevention.  Accident investigation board members  are  not  authorized access  to  privileged  safety  information  at  any  time  before  or  during  the  investigation.  The legal  advisor ensures the SIB  does not  provide privileged safety information to  the accident investigation board. 1.4.3.  The  SIB  produces  a  multi-part  report.    Part  1  contains  non-privileged,  factual information.    Part  2  contains  privileged  witness  statements  and  documents,  as  well  as privileged SIB deliberations, findings, and recommendations.  Part 3 contains the briefing the SIB provides the CA.  The accident investigation board only receives non-privileged, factual information. 1.4.4.  Prior to  the start  of its investigation, the accident investigation must  receive all non-privileged information from the SIB.  The non-privileged portions of the SIB report comprise Tabs  A  through  S  of  the  accident  investigation  report.    An  accident  investigation  shall  not begin until the SIB has provided the legal advisor all of the non-privileged information and released  its  witnesses.    Only  AFLOA/JACC,  in  limited  circumstances,  may  authorize  an earlier start. 1.5.  When  Accident  Investigations  are  Required.  Except  as  provided  in  paragraph  1.8,  an accident investigation must be convened for the following: 1.5.1.  Class A accidents. 1.5.1.1.  Except  as  specified  in  paragraphs  1.5.1.3.2.1  and  1.5.1.3.3  below,  AIBs  are required  for  on-duty,  Class  A  accidents  involving  Air  Force  aerospace  assets,  which include  manned  and  remotely  piloted  aircraft,  missiles,  space  assets/vehicles,  and aerostats.    The  terms  “remotely  piloted  aircraft”  (RPA),  “remotely  piloted  vehicle” (RPV), “unmanned aerial system,” (UAS) and “unmanned aerial vehicle” (UAV) all have the same meaning for the purpose of this publication.  See Attachment 1 for the definition of “on-duty.” 1.5.1.2.  GAIBs  are  required  for  all  other  on-duty,  Class  A  accidents  not  involving  Air Force aerospace assets, unless otherwise excluded in this publication. 1.5.1.3.  A Class A accident is one resulting in at least one of the following: 1.5.1.3.1.  An injury or occupational  illness resulting in  a  fatality or permanent  total disability. 1.5.1.3.2.  An  Air  Force  aerospace  asset  is  destroyed.    See  Attachment  1  for  the definition of “destroyed aerospace asset.” 1.5.1.3.2.1.  AIBs  are  not  mandatory  for  Class  A  accidents  in  which  remotely piloted subscale aircraft and aerial targets are destroyed.   10  AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015 1.5.1.3.3.  Total cost of damages to Government and other property is $2,000,000 or more.    An  accident  investigation  (AIB  or  GAIB)  is  optional  for  on-duty  Class  A mishaps  that  result  solely  in  damage  to  Government  property,  and  in  the  case  of  a mishap involving an aerospace asset, the aerospace asset was not destroyed. 1.5.1.3.3.1.  See  DoDI  6055.07,  Enclosure  2  and  AFI  91-204,  Chapter  1  and Attachment  1  for  more  information  about  mishap  categories  and  classes.    Total mishap cost  is  calculated in  accordance with  (IAW) guidance specified in  DoDI 6055.07, Enclosure 4, paragraph 9 and AFI 91-204, Chapter 1. 1.5.2.  Mishaps with a probability of high public interest, including interest from Congress or the media, as determined by the CA’s SJA in consultation with the AFLOA/JACC. 1.5.3.  Mishaps  when  claims  and  litigation  are  anticipated  for  or  against  the  United  States Government  or  a  United  States  Government  contractor  as  a  result  of  the  mishap,  as determined by AFLOA/JACC in consultation with the CA’s SJA. 1.5.4.  Mishaps  causing  significant  civilian  property  damage,  as  determined  by AFLOA/JACC in consultation with the CA’s SJA. 1.6.  Discretionary Accident Investigations.  Except as provided in paragraphs 1.5 and 1.8, the CA  has  the  option  to  convene  a  discretionary  accident  investigation  for  any  occurrence considered an “accident” or “mishap” as defined in Attachment 1. types  of legal 1.7.  Other  DoDI  6055.  07  Legal  Investigations.  In addition to accident investigations, there are  several legal investigation/report requirement:  Security Forces or Air Force Office of Special Investigations, CDI,  Report  of  Survey  investigations,  and  Line  of  Duty  determinations.    These  investigations should  inquire  into  all  the  facts  and  circumstances  surrounding  mishaps  as  well  as  obtain  and preserve  all  available  evidence  for  use  in  litigation,  claims,  disciplinary  action,  adverse administrative action, and for public disclosure IAW DoD 5400.7-R. investigations  which  satisfy the  DoDI  6055.07 1.8.  Accidents Not Requiring an Investigation Pursuant to this Publication.  Do not convene an accident investigation pursuant to this publication for the following occurrences: 1.8.1.  Damage,  injury  or  death  by  direct  action  of  an  enemy,  to  include  maneuvering conducted relative to hostile fire or a perceived hostile threat, or hostile force. 1.8.2.  All suspected cases of friendly fire as defined in DoDI 6055.07. 1.8.3.  Intentional  or  expected  damage  to  Air  Force  equipment  or  property  (e.g.,  authorized testing  or  combat  training,  including  missile  and  ordnance  firing;  destruction  of  weapon system to prevent capture by enemy or hostile force; etc.).  This exception does not apply to occurrences for which an investigation was conducted pursuant to AFI 91-204. 1.8.4.  Normal residual damage as a result of a missile launch. 1.8.5.  Intentional, controlled jettison or release, during flight, of canopies, cargo, doors, drag chutes,  hatches,  life  rafts,  auxiliary  fuel  tanks,  missiles,  drones,  rockets,  non-nuclear munitions, and externally carried equipment not essential to flight when there is no injury, no reportable  damage  to  the  aircraft  or  other  property,  and,  in  the  case  of  missiles,  drones,  or non-nuclear munitions, when the reason for jettison is not malfunction. AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015   11  1.8.6.  Accidents investigated by another federal agency or military department resulting in a publicly-releasable report. 1.8.6.1.  If  an  accident  is  investigated  by  another  federal  agency  or  military  department resulting  in  a  publicly-releasable  report,  an  accident  investigation  is  not  required.  However,  the  CA  may,  after  consultation  with  AFLOA/JACC,  convene  a  discretionary accident investigation. 1.8.7.  Incidents or occurrences not meeting the definition of “accident” in Attachment 1. 1.8.8.  Contractor  mishaps  in  which  the  contractor  employee  is  not  under  the  direct supervision of DoD personnel. 1.8.9.  Injuries associated with non-occupational diseases, when the disease, not the injury, is the proximate cause of the lost time, such as diabetes and its resultant complications like loss of  vision;  but  not  including  complications  of  the  injury  (such  as  the  infection  of  a  cut aggravated by a work-related activity) that result in lost time. 1.8.10.  Injuries resulting from altercations, attack, or assault, unless injuries of this type were incurred in the performance of official duties. 1.8.11.  Injuries  sustained  before  entry  into  military  service  or  employment  by  the  United States Government, unless the injuries were specifically aggravated or accelerated by current tenure of service. 1.8.12.  Injuries  resulting  from  pre-existing  musculoskeletal  disorders,  unless  the  injuries were specifically aggravated or accelerated by current tenure of service. 1.8.13.  Replacement of component parts due to normal wear and tear, which is beyond the scope  or  definition  of  the  affected  time  between  overhaul  of  component,  and  when  any associated damage is confined to the component part.  This exemption only applies to items that  are  normally  used  until  they  fail  or  until  predetermined  wear  limits  are  reached.    The need for replacement may not be evident until malfunction or failure of the part.  Resultant damage to other components is reportable. 1.8.14.  Attempted or consummated suicide, murder, or intentionally self-inflicted injuries. 1.8.15.  Inpatient hospitalization for treatment where the patient is retained beyond the day of admission  solely  for  administrative  reasons  unless  other  reporting  criteria  are  met  (e.g., medical treatment beyond first aid). 1.8.16.  Inpatient  hospitalization solely for observation, counseling, or diagnostic testing, or for administrative reasons not related to the immediate injury or occupational illness, unless other reporting criteria are met (e.g., medical treatment beyond first aid). 1.8.17.  Injuries  resulting  from  minimum  stress  and  strain  (e.g.,  simple,  natural,  and nonviolent body positions or actions, as in dressing, sleeping, coughing, or sneezing).  Those are injuries unrelated to mishap-producing agents or environments normally associated with active participation in daily work or recreation. 1.8.18.  Injuries  or  fatalities  to  persons  in  the  act  of  escaping  from  or  eluding  military  or civilian custody or arrest.   12  AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015 1.8.19.  Death  due  to  natural  causes  unrelated  to  strenuous  acts  performed  at  work  or  to physical  training  associated  with  the  requirement  to  pass  physical  standards.    However, fatalities  associated  with  physical  fitness  standards  (training  to  meet  fitness  standards  or taking the fitness test) will be investigated through an accident investigation. 1.8.20.  Foreign object damage to aircraft, air-breathing missiles, or drone engines discovered during scheduled engine disassembly. 1.8.21.  Property  damage,  death,  or  injury  as  a  result  of  vandalism,  riots,  civil  disorders, sabotage, terrorist activities, or other criminal acts, such as arson. 1.8.22.  Adverse bodily reactions resulting directly from the use of drugs under the direction of competent medical authority. 1.8.23.  Death  or  injury  resulting  directly  from  the  illegal  use  of  drugs  or  other  substance abuse. 1.8.24.  Accidents involving nuclear weapons, reactors, or  radioactive materials  involved in those systems. 1.8.25.  Accidents  involving  the  administration  of  professional  services,  including  (but  not limited  to)  diagnosing  medical  conditions,  prescribing  medication,  providing  dental  care, performing  surgery,  administering  physical therapy,  accomplishing  mental  health evaluations, conducting counseling, and providing legal assistance and advice. 1.8.26.  Mishaps that are not connected to the duties  of the involved Air Force personnel. 1.9.  Investigation Boards and Reports. 1.9.1.  Ongoing  safety  investigations  take  precedence  over  accident  investigations.    Safety investigations have priority in the event of conflicts between the two investigations regarding access  to  the  accident  site,  acquiring  and  examining  evidence,  and  interviewing  witnesses.  Part 1 of the SIB report must be completed prior to the start of the accident investigation.  If some  of  the  tabs  contain  preliminary  reports,  it  may  still  be  considered  completed.    To facilitate the accident  investigation process,  the two investigations shall not  overlap in  time unless AFLOA/JACC has granted a waiver. 1.9.2.  In the  case of  a high-interest  mishap, the CA may convene an accident investigation prior  to  a  SIB.    However,  the  accident  investigation  may  not  otherwise  start  prior  to  the completion of the safety investigation.  See Chapter 7. 1.9.2.1.  If  there  is  no  preceding  SIB,  a  trained  investigating  officer  (IO)  not  currently assigned  to  a  full-time  safety  position  may  serve  as  an  accident  investigation  subject matter expert (SME) to assist in gathering factual non-privileged evidence.  See Chapter 3. 1.9.2.2.  Personnel  performing  safety  duties  shall  not  be  appointed  to  an  accident investigation board. 1.9.3.  An  accident  investigation  should  be  completed  within  30  days  of  the  start  date.  Although completion of the investigation within 30 days is the goal, the primary concern is producing a thorough, complete, and high-quality report in compliance with this publication. AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015   13  1.9.3.1.  An accident investigation’s 30-day clock starts when the legal advisor provides Part 1 and other collateral evidence to the board president. 1.9.3.2.  The  board  president  may  request  an  extension  of  time  to  complete  the investigation to the CA or the CA’s SJA for approval, if the CA delegates this authority to the CA’s SJA.   14  AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015 Chapter 2 CONVENING THE INVESTIGATION BOARD 2.1.  Convening Authority. 2.1.1.  Accident investigations are convened by Major Command (MAJCOM) commanders.  Where  applicable,  the  MAJCOM  commander  who  convened  or  would  have  convened  the preceding  safety  investigation  under  AFI  91-204,  Chapter  4,  also  convenes  the  accident investigation.  See Attachment 1 for definition of “MAJCOM commander.” 2.1.1.1.  The  MAJCOM  commander  may  delegate  the  authority  to  convene  accident investigations to the MAJCOM vice commander.  The authority to convene the accident investigation may not be delegated below the level of the MAJCOM vice commander. 2.1.1.2.  Accident investigations should be convened within 7 duty days of convening the safety investigation for the same mishap.  However, the decision to convene an accident investigation will be made prior to the CA receiving the results of the safety investigation for the same mishap. 2.1.2.  The  CA  convenes  an  accident  investigation  by  appointing  the  board  president  in  a written convening order.  The convening order may also list additional board members.  See a sample convening order in Attachment 2. 2.1.2.1.  The  CA  may  delegate  the  authority  to  sign  the  convening  order  “FOR  THE COMMANDER” to the CA’s SJA.  This authority may not be delegated further. 2.1.3.  The CA may delegate the authority to appoint, remove, or substitute additional board members to the CA’s SJA.  This authority may not be delegated further. 2.2.  Accidents  Involving  Air  Force  Reserve  Command  and  Air  National  Guard  Assets, Personnel, or Property. 2.2.1.  The  active  component  MAJCOM  commander  convenes  investigations  for  accidents involving both active component and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) or Air National Guard (ANG) assets, personnel, or property.  If the active component MAJCOM commander opts  to  not  exercise  his  or  her  discretion  to  convene  an  accident  investigation,  the Commander,  Air  Force  Reserve  Command  (AFRC/CC),  may  convene  an  accident investigation board.   AFRC/CC may  further delegate this authority to  the vice  commander, AFRC, but no further delegation is authorized. 2.2.1.1.  AFRC/CC may convene accident investigations pursuant to this publication only when  the  accident  involves  solely  AFRC  resources  (personnel  and  property)  (e.g.,  no active  duty  Air  Force  personnel  or  resources  involved  in  the  mishap),  and  the  active component MAJCOM does not conduct an accident investigation. 2.2.2.  When  investigating  an  accident  involving  AFRC  or  ANG  assets,  personnel,  or property,  the  CA  may  consider  appointing  an  AFRC  or  ANG  member  (respectively)  to  the accident investigation board.  For ANG members, the CA must have the concurrence of the respective State Adjutant General. AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015   15  2.3.  Accidents  Involving  Air  Force  Members  or  Property  and  Personnel  or  Property Assigned to Another Military Department.  Follow the inter-service participation guidance in DoDI  6055.07,  Enclosure  4,  paragraph  6  for  aerospace  or  ground  accidents  involving  an  Air Force member or property and personnel or property assigned to another military department to avoid duplicative investigations and reports. 2.4.  Accidents  Involving  Assets  or  Personnel  from  Other  Major  Commands  or  Military Departments.  When an accident involves assets or personnel from more than one MAJCOM or from other Military Departments, refer to DoDI 6055.07, Enclosure 4, paragraph 6.  The accident investigation  CA  should  generally  be  the  same  individual  who  has  authority  to  convene  the preceding SIB. 2.5.  Accidents  Involving  Civil  Aircraft.  The  CA’s  SJA  will  contact  AFLOA/JACC  to determine  the  potential  for  and  scope  of  National  Transportation  Safety  Board  (NTSB) participation  or  investigation  for  aerospace  accidents  involving  both  civil  aircraft  and  United States Air Force aerospace assets. 2.5.1.  If  the  NTSB  initiates  an  investigation,  refer  to  AFI  91-206(I),  Participation  in  a Military  or  Civil  Aircraft  Accident  Safety  Investigation.    Additionally,  the  CA’s  SJA  shall consult with AFLOA/JACC prior to advising the CA whether to conduct a separate AIB. 2.6.  Accidents  Involving  United  States  Air  Force  Assets  in  Foreign  Countries  or  Foreign Military  Assets  in  the  United  States.  United  States  Air  Force  asset  accidents  in  foreign territory or accidents in the United States involving foreign military assets may be subject to an accident  investigation  regardless  of  the  mishap  location  or  the  degree  of  foreign  country involvement.    See  DoDI  6055.07,  Enclosure  4  for  additional  information  for  joint  or  multi-national investigations. 2.6.1.  Treaties, statutes, agreements, and/or other applicable authorities may affect accident investigations  occurring  outside  the  United  States  involving  Air  Force  assets.    Similar authorities  may  affect  the  investigation  of  Air  Force  accidents  involving  personnel  or property of foreign military forces.  When an accident involving an Air Force asset occurs in a  foreign  territory  or  involves  foreign  military  personnel  or  property,  comply  with  this publication  to  the  extent  it  is  consistent  with  applicable  treaties,  agreements,  and  other applicable authorities.  The requirement to  conduct  an accident investigation and produce a report IAW this publication remains unaffected by the location of the accident or the degree of participation of a foreign country in the accident investigation. 2.6.2.  The  CA’s  SJA  or  the  SJA  of  the  Air  Force  component  responsible  for  operations where the accident occurred refers to the treaty, statute, regulation, or agreement under which the  asset  was  operating  to  determine  if  the  document  addresses  accident  investigation protocol  and  identifies  provisions  requiring  a  joint  or  multi-nation  investigation  or  an appointment  of  a  foreign  representative  as  an  observer  or  a  member  to  the  accident investigation. 2.6.2.1.  Consult  DoDI  6055.07,  Enclosure  4,  paragraph  8  and  the  Operations  and International  Law  Directorate  (AF/JAO)  before  inviting  foreign  military  service representatives  to  observe  or  participate  in  any  capacity  in  an  accident  investigation.  Prior  coordination  with  the  Office  of  Air  Force  International  Affairs  (SAF/IA)  and  the senior  foreign  country  representative  is  required  to  appoint  a  foreign  government   16  AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015 representative  to  the  accident  investigation.    Foreign  government  representatives participating in the accident investigation must first agree in writing to comply with the provisions of this publication, unless that requirement is already provided for under some other agreement or directive. 2.6.3.  Consult  the  CA’s  SJA  for  assistance  in  obtaining  copies  (and  translations,  if necessary)  of  reports  written  by  foreign  military  or  civilian  authorities  that  investigate  an accident  involving  Air  Force  resources  (personnel  or  property).    The  CA’s  SJA  can coordinate  with  the  Geographic  Combatant  Command  or  its  Air  Component  SJA  as warranted. 2.7.  Accidents  Involving  Space  Assets.  Aerospace  accidents  involving  both  civil  and  United States Air Force space assets yield unique issues regarding commercial vendors and other federal agencies conducting independent investigations.  Potential issues to consider include:  who is the lead  investigating  office  or  agency;  what  are  the  procedures/protocols  for  information  sharing and  the  handling  of  classified/sensitive  payloads;  what  are  the  existing  memorandums  of agreement  (MOA)/memorandums  of  understanding  with  other  federal  agencies;  whether  the space asset is operational or experimental; and if the asset has been handed over to the Air Force or is still in check-out by the contractor or acquisition agency [Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC)].    Engage  in  early  and  continuous  consultation  with  the  Office  of  the  Staff  Judge Advocate, Air Force Space Command (AFSPC/JA).  See Chapter 12. 2.8.  Accident Investigation Funding and Orders. 2.8.1.  The CA shall fund temporary duty (TDY) travel costs for all board  members, SMEs, and witnesses, including personnel from other MAJCOMs.  TDY board members are placed on full per diem for the duration of the accident investigation, subject to the requirements of the Joint Travel Regulations (JTR) and DoD Financial Management Regulation, which takes precedence  in  the  event  of  conflicting  information  between  the  JTR  and  this  publication.  Dual  billeting,  variations  authorized,  and  rental  car  (or  a  dedicated  government  vehicle  if available) shall be authorized for each TDY board member.  The CA’s SJA may adjust the authorization  for  rental  cars  (or  dedicated  government  vehicles)  if  fiscal  constraints  or government vehicle availability prohibits a dedicated vehicle for each board member, as long as  doing  so  does  not  in  the  board  president’s  opinion,  hamper  the  ability  of  the  board members  to  effectively  and  efficiently  conduct  the  investigation.    At  a  minimum, authorization  for  a  dedicated  vehicle  must  be  authorized  for  the  board  president,  legal advisor,  and  recorder  with  remaining  board  members  sharing  an  appropriate  number  of vehicles as determined by the CA’s SJA. 2.8.1.1.  Each board member’s unit issues his/her travel authorization (e.g., orders) for 45 days of travel, with variations authorized, dual billeting, excess baggage, rental car (see paragraph  2.8.1  above),  and  full  per  diem  (unless  contravened  by  higher  regulatory authority). 2.8.1.2.  Invited  observers  from  other  Military  Departments,  agencies,  or  governments, fund their own costs. 2.8.1.3.  For joint service boards, each Military Department funds its own personnel.  See AFI 65-601, Volume 1, Budget Guidance and Procedures, Chapter 10. AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015   17  2.8.1.4.  If  the  investigation  requires  travel  outside  the  United  States,  board  members should consult their local military or civilian personnel flight before departing their home station for guidance about travel restrictions and requirements. 2.8.2.  The CA provides  funds and support costs  associated with  leasing  vehicles or special equipment, leased communications, transportation, and other contractual services. 2.8.3.  The CA will be responsible for funding any contractual transcription services should Air Force court reporter support be unavailable.  Approval for this contractual service must be approved by the CA’s SJA prior to entering into any agreements with a commercial court-reporting  service.    The  CA  may  also  appoint  an  enlisted  Air  Force  court  reporter  to  serve full-time on the accident investigation through its conclusion. 2.8.3.1.  A  court  reporter  who  has  provided  transcription  services  to  the  safety investigation shall not provide transcription services to the accident investigation. 2.8.3.2.  In order to avoid a potential unauthorized release of information, the board will not  provide  any  investigation  information  or  testimony  for  transcription  to  any  person who is not a military member or DoD employee, unless that individual has first agreed in writing, through the use of a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) or other method, to abide by  the  restrictions  of  this  publication  regarding  disclosure  of  investigation  information prior to receiving any materials to transcribe. 2.8.3.3.  No person who provided transcription services for the safety investigation shall provide transcription services for the accident investigation. 2.8.4.  The  CA    or  other  DoD  component  that  owns,  has  operational  control  over,  or  is otherwise  accountable  for  the  vehicle,  system,  or  other  property  determined  by  the  CA  to have caused the environmental damage at the accident site shall fund all costs associated with long-term accident  site clean-up and  environmental  remediation unless the provisions of an applicable MOA or intra-agency support agreement dictate otherwise. 2.8.4.1.  The CA funds costs associated with removal and storage of wreckage, as well as any initial accident site clean-up. 2.8.5.  The  host  installation  will  fund  all  in-house  support.    (T-1).    “In-house  support” includes,  but  is  not  limited  to:    work  areas  and  office  work  space;  computers  with  Internet access; use of  computers, printers, color  copy machines, and fax machines;  office supplies; paper supplies and computer CDs or DVDs; telephone service; use of government owned or leased  vehicles;  use  of  audio-visual  equipment  and  services;  and  transcription  equipment.  See Attachment 3 for a list of accident investigation support requirements. 2.8.5.1.  If  the  host  installation  is  not  assigned  to  the  CA’s  MAJCOM  (e.g.,  the  host installation is hosting the accident investigation for convenience purposes), then the host installation  may  be  reimbursed  for  accident  investigation  expenses  from  the  convening MAJCOM.   18  AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015 QUALIFICATIONS AND COMPOSITION FOR BOARD APPOINTMENT Chapter 3 3.1.  General Qualifications. 3.1.1.  Required Membership of Accident Investigations.  A majority of the board members must not be from the “mishap unit.”  “Mishap unit” is defined by Title 10 United States Code (U.S.C.), Section 2255 (10 U.S.C. § 2255) as “the unit of the armed forces (at the squadron or  battalion  level  or  equivalent)  to  which  was  assigned  the  flight  crew  of  the  aircraft  that sustained the accident that is the subject of the investigation.” 3.1.1.1.  Board members shall not be from the wing (or equivalent organization) to which the  aerospace  asset,  crewmembers,  or  other  individuals  involved  in  the  accident  were assigned  or  attached,  or  which  is  accountable  for  any  equipment,  material,  facility,  or other  property  involved  in  the  accident  (the  “mishap  wing”).    However,  if  the  CA determines one or more board members must be appointed from the mishap wing because the  necessary  expertise  cannot  be  obtained  elsewhere,  then  the  majority  of  the  board members  must  come  from  outside  the  mishap  wing.    In  any  case,  the  board  president shall not be from the mishap wing. 3.1.2.  If  no  qualified  and  current  member  is  reasonably  available  outside  the  mishap squadron, a member from the mishap squadron may serve as a SME to the board. 3.1.3.  The  CA  shall  not  appoint  any  person  to  the  accident  investigation  board  whose participation in the investigation could actually cause or create an appearance of a conflict of interest or other perceived impropriety. 3.1.4.  Interim safety board and SIB members may  not  serve as AIB or GAIB members for the same accident. 3.1.5.  Personnel performing safety duties shall not be appointed as board members or SMEs to the board. 3.1.5.1.  In  cases  where  there  was  no  preceding  SIB,  a  trained  safety  IO  not  currently performing safety duties or assigned to a safety billet may serve as a SME to the board to assist in gathering factual non-privileged evidence. 3.1.6.  Board  members  must  not  have  had  access  to  privileged  safety  information  from  the preceding SIB (to include privileged SIB message reports and other progress reports).  If they have had access to privileged safety information, they must be replaced. 3.2.  Board President Qualifications. 3.2.1.  Board presidents must be field grade officers, equal to or senior in rank to the senior person directly involved in the accident, and must come from outside the mishap wing. 3.2.2.  For  Class  A  accidents,  the  board  president  should  be  equivalent  in  grade  to  the corresponding SIB president.  For any accident involving a fatality, the AIB president must be a general officer or brigadier general select.  The GAIB president in a fatality mishap must be  at  least  a  colonel,  unless  the  preceding  SIB  president  was  a  general  officer  or  brigadier general select, in which case the GAIB president will be equivalent in grade. AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015   19  3.2.3.  Unless  the board president is  current  and qualified in  the mishap airframe or vehicle involved in the mishap, a board member who is current and qualified in the mishap airframe or  vehicle  must  be  appointed  to  the  accident  investigation.    If  no  current  and  qualified individual  from  outside  the  mishap  wing  is  available,  then  one  from  the  mishap  wing  may serve as a SME to the board. 3.2.3.1.  For  manned  aircraft  accidents,  AIB  presidents  must  be  rated  officers  (pilots, navigators, or air battle managers) and should have experience with the same or similar mishap  airframe.    GAIB  presidents  should  have expertise  and  experience  in  the  mishap asset, medical situation, or other relevant circumstances surrounding the mishap. 3.2.3.2.  If  an  aerospace  asset  investigation  concerns  predominantly  maintenance  issues, the  CA  may  appoint  a  maintenance  officer  board  president  with  mishap  airframe  or vehicle  experience  provided  a  pilot/operator  who  is  current  and  qualified  in  the  mishap airframe  or  vehicle  is  appointed  as  a  board  member.    Care  must  be  exercised  to  not prejudge the cause of the mishap when appointing the board president. 3.2.3.3.  For  RPA  accidents,  it  is  not  required  the  board  president  be  a  rated  officer provided he/she has relevant experience with the mishap RPA. 3.2.3.4.  For  missile  or  space  accidents,  the  board  president  must  be  a  missile  or  space operations  officer  and  should  have  expertise  and  experience  in  the  mishap  missile  or system. 3.2.4.  Board  presidents  must  complete  the  Air  Force  Safety  Center  (AFSEC)  Board Presidents Course (BPC) prior to serving as a board president. 3.2.5.

Board Composition Requirements. 3.4.1.  The composition of the board is tailored to reflect the complexity of the accident. 3.4.2.  At  a  minimum,  each  board  must  have  a  board  president,  a  legal  advisor,  and  a recorder.  The recorder should be a paralegal. 3.4.3.  Other  appointed  board  members  typically  include:    a  pilot  member  or  missile/space operations officer member, a maintenance member or missile/space materiel officer member, and a medical member.  In aerospace asset mishaps resulting in a fatality or serious personal   20  AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015 injury, the medical member should be a flight doctor.  See Chapter 13 for typical members appointed to the GAIB. 3.4.4.  Personnel  from  a  variety  of  other  specialties  such  as,  metallurgy,  personnel,  aircrew flight equipment, aerodynamics, airfield operations (air traffic control (ATC) and/or airfield management), operations (e.g., tactics, flight rules, instrument procedures), and security, may serve  as  board  members,  as  necessary  to  assist  in  the  thorough  investigation  of  the  mishap and completion of the report. 3.4.5.  If  an  accident  is  in  a  foreign  country,  involves  foreign  personnel,  or  involves  assets from  another  service  or  reserve/guard  unit,  the  CA  may  appoint  additional  board  members IAW Chapter 2. 3.4.6.  Changes  in  board  composition.    During  the  investigation,  the  board  president  may request the following: 3.4.6.1.  Appointment of additional board members. 3.4.6.2.  Detailing of SMEs to the board. 3.4.6.3.  Release or replacement of any individual who is serving as a board member or SME. 3.5.  Subject Matter Expert Qualifications. 3.5.1.  One or more SMEs may be detailed to advise the accident investigation board but will not serve as board members.  SMEs will not be appointed on the convening order.  Once the issue  for  which  the  SME  was  detailed  to  the  board  is  resolved,  the  SME  no  longer participates  in  the  accident  investigation.    Personnel  performing  safety  duties  will  not  be designated or serve as SMEs. 3.5.1.1.  A  military  member  or  DoD  civilian  employee  with  sufficient  knowledge,  skill, or training regarding a specific  area may serve  as a SME to  the board in that particular area. 3.5.1.2.  Whenever  possible,  the  accident  investigation  should  not  use  a  SME  who assisted the safety investigation. 3.5.2.

Resource  Guidance.  Prior  to  arriving  at  the  host  installation,  all  board  members  should review this publication, any applicable MAJCOM supplement, and the following publications, as necessary: 5.1.1.  DoD  5400.7-R_AFMAN  33-302  describes  how  to  process  Freedom  of  Information Act (FOIA) requests as well as the types of information that are withheld from public release. 5.1.2.  AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management.  This implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 31-4, Information Security, and supplements DoD Manual 5200.01, DoD Information  Security Program:  Protection of Classified Information, which describes how to protect classified and unclassified controlled information. 5.1.3.  AFI  33-332,  The  Air  Force  Privacy  and  Civil  Liberties  Program,  implements  the Privacy  Act  of  1974  within  the  Air  Force.    Prior  to  approval  of  the  report,  personal information must be redacted to protect privacy interests. 5.1.4.  AFI 34-1101, Air Force Warrior and Survivor Care, provides guidance on rendering assistance to family members of those killed in aviation and ground accidents. 5.1.5.  AFI  90-301,  Inspector  General  Complaints  Resolution,  provides  additional  useful information  about  witness  interviews,  rights  advisements,  handling  evidence,  and  reporting requirements in cases involving misconduct by senior officials. 5.1.6.  AFI  91-204,  Safety  Investigations  and  Reports,  governs  the  safety  investigation  and describes the contents of Part 1 of the SIB report, which form Tabs A through S of the report. 5.1.7.  Air  Force  Manual  (AFMAN)  91-221,  Weapons  Safety  Investigations  and  Reports, AFMAN 91-222, Space Safety Investigations and Reports, AFMAN 91-223, Aviation Safety Investigations and Reports, and AFMAN 91-224, Ground Safety Investigations and Reports, describe the safety investigation process for the different categories of accidents. 5.1.8.  Relevant  international  agreements,  MOAs,  Unified  Combatant  Command  directives, or  other  sources  of  applicable  requirements  or  guidance  identified  by  the  CA  or  the  CA’s SJA. 5.2.  Initial Actions. 5.2.1.  The  board  president  must  contact  the  legal  advisor  for  an  initial  briefing  within  24 hours  after  being  appointed.    If  the  legal  advisor  has  not  been  identified,  then  the  board president must contact the CA’s SJA to obtain the initial briefing. 5.2.1.1.  The  legal  advisor’s  initial  briefing  should  cover  at  least  the  following  topics:  safety privilege, conflicts of interest in board members, board scheduling, and transfer of the  non-privileged  safety  information.    If  it  is  a  high-interest  mishap,  the  legal  advisor also discusses the 48-hour visit. 5.2.2.  Following accidents involving a fatality and/or serious injury, the board president will proceed with the legal advisor to the accident site (or to the location where the SIB convenes) no later than 48 hours after arrival of the SIB in order to contact the FAR(s), to meet the NoK   34  AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015 and/or seriously injured personnel, address media questions, and view the mishap site.  This is commonly referred to as the “48-hour visit.”  The legal advisor will not attend the initial in-person briefing to the NoK or seriously injured personnel.  In all other types of mishaps, the  CA  should  consider  the  advantages  of  having  the  board  president  and  legal  advisor proceed to  the accident  site shortly  after the arrival  of the SIB in  order to view the mishap site first-hand. 5.2.2.1.  So long as the  board’s ability to  conduct  the investigation is  not  compromised, and there are no media or other public request for information at the accident site or the location of the safety investigation, this requirement may be waived by the CA in unusual cases where it is neither practical or necessary to have the board president at the accident scene. 5.2.2.2.  If the NoK and/or seriously injured personnel are in a different location than the accident  location,  the  board  president  will  travel  to  the  NoK  and/or  seriously  injured personnel’s  location  for  an  initial  in-person  briefing,  unless  the  NoK  and/or  seriously injured personnel do not wish to receive an in-person briefing. 5.2.2.3.  If the NoK and/or seriously injured personnel are in a different location than the accident location, the legal  advisor may accompany the board president to this location, but  will  not  attend  the  initial  in-person  briefing  to  the  NoK  and  seriously  injured personnel.    If  it  is  known  the  NoK  and/or  seriously  injured  personnel  will  have  an attorney present, the legal advisor shall contact the CA’s SJA, who, in turn, will contact AFLOA/JACC to determine whether the legal advisor should attend the initial in-person briefing. 5.2.2.4.  When the board president of the accident investigation is not on-site, it does not create  a  situation  in  which  the  SIB  president,  or  anyone  else,  should  assume  the aforementioned responsibilities. 5.2.2.5.  The  board  president  of  the  accident  investigation  coordinates  with  the  incident commander  (if  applicable),  the  legal  advisor,  the  CA’s  SJA,  and  the  FAR(s)  regarding NoK requests to visit the mishap site. 5.2.2.6.  Once  the  board  president’s  “48-hour  visit”  duties  are  completed,  the  board president and legal advisor depart the accident site, pending receipt of the non-privileged safety information from the SIB. 5.2.2.7.  The  board  president,  through  the  FAR(s),  provides  updated  information  to  the NoK and seriously injured personnel regarding the status of the investigations. 5.2.3.  For accidents involving foreign interests, the legal advisor consults the CA’s SJA and host  installation’s  SJA  regarding  immediate  responsibilities  to  foreign  military  and  civilian authorities.  The legal advisor, in turn, briefs the board president. 5.2.4.  To avoid the inadvertent receipt of privileged safety information, the board president of the accident investigation should not contact the SIB president without consulting with the legal  advisor  or  obtaining  an  initial  briefing  from  the  CA’s  SJA.    Thereafter,  the  board president of the accident investigation, or the legal  advisor on the board  president’s behalf, may engage with the SIB president solely to: 5.2.4.1.  Determine the status of SAR, recovery of remains, and salvage operations. AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015   35  5.2.4.2.  Coordinate  a  visit  to  the  mishap  site  prior  to  removal  of  the  wreckage,  if  the board president so requests. 5.2.4.3.  Determine  the  status  of  the  safety  investigation  and  decide  when  and  where  to proceed with the accident investigation. 5.2.4.3.1.  The  board  president  of  the  accident  investigation  may  not  receive privileged safety information from the preceding safety investigation.  However, the board  president  through  the  legal  advisor  may  receive  factual  non-privileged information from the SIB president in order to respond to public inquiries before the accident investigation has begun. 5.2.4.3.2.  In any discussions (e.g., phone calls, e-mails, etc.) between the safety and accident  investigation  board  presidents,  the  legal  advisor  will  be  present.    The  legal advisor ensures that privileged safety information is  not  inadvertently relayed to  the accident investigation board president. 5.2.4.3.3.  No  member  of  the  AIB/GAIB  will  discuss  the  accident  investigation  nor release any substantive information related to the accident investigation to anyone in the  safety  community  prior  to  approval  of  the  accident  investigation  report  unless specifically approved by the CA, in consultation with the CA’s SJA. 5.2.5.  The  legal  advisor  and/or  recorder  contacts  the  host  installation  liaison  (or  host installation  commander’s  office  if  a  liaison  is  not  appointed)  to  obtain  work  areas, equipment, and administrative support.    The work area and office space should be suitable to facilitate the accident investigation and witness interviews.    Avoid using the installation courtroom since a judicial atmosphere may make witnesses uncomfortable.  Controlled entry limited to the accident investigation board members is required.    See Attachment 3. 5.2.6.  The  board  president  of  the  accident  investigation  receives  transfer  of  custody  of  the wreckage,  if  any,  in  writing  from  the  SIB  president.    If  the  board  president  of  the  accident investigation  is  not  available  to  sign  the  transfer  memorandum,  the  legal  advisor  may  sign “FOR THE BOARD PRESIDENT.” 5.2.6.1.  The wreckage, if any, is  secured in  a  facility with  limited access to  control the chain of custody and permit only the accident investigation access to the wreckage. 5.2.7.  The  legal  advisor  should  coordinate  and  be  present  for  a  face-to-face  transfer  of  the non-privileged safety information (including all original documents, gathered by the SIB but not  included  in  the  SIB  Part  1)  from  the  SIB  to  the  accident  investigation.    The  board president may also be present.  The SIB provides an itemized inventory of all non-privileged evidence  transferred  to  the  accident  investigation  and  its  witness  list  (including  witnesses promised confidentiality) regardless of whether the SIB reduced their statement to writing. 5.2.8.  The  legal  advisor  shall  screen  all  evidence  to  ensure  it  does  not  contain  privileged safety  information  before  the  board  president  and  members  review  it.    If  the  legal  advisor suspects  any  evidence  received  from  the  safety  investigation  contains  privileged  safety information  as  defined  in  AFI  91-204  and  Chapter  1  of  this  publication,  the  legal  advisor shall  consult  with  AFSEC/JA  before  releasing  the  information  to  the  rest  of  the  board  in order to verify whether the information is, in fact, privileged.   36  AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015 5.2.9.  The legal advisor briefs members of the board on the purpose and format of the report and explains the accident investigation process. 5.2.10.  The board president, at his/her discretion, assigns each board member sections of the report to draft. 5.2.11.  The board president consults with the legal advisor and the CA’s SJA regarding any request  received  for  wreckage  repair,  release  of  salvageable  wreckage  parts,  and  release  of mishap  aircraft  servicing  equipment  prior  to  completion  of  the  accident  investigation.    See Chapter 9 for the procedures to release the wreckage from legal hold in Class A mishaps. 5.3.  Suggested Investigation Schedule.  Plan to complete the accident investigation and report within 30 calendar days of when the legal advisor provides Part 1 and other collateral evidence to the board president. Note:  Each accident investigation is different and boards should be flexible with their time and scheduling, as circumstances will vary on when witnesses are available or how long evidence gathering, deliberations, writing and editing may take.  The table below is not an exhaustive list of all actions the board needs to take during the course of an accident investigation. Table 5.1.

Gathering  and  Reviewing  Additional  Evidence.  During  the  course  of  the  investigation, board members: 5.4.1.  Gather  and  review  all  relevant,  non-privileged  evidence.    Relevant  evidence  may  be owned and/or maintained by any person, office, or organization, to include government and non-government individuals and entities.  Relevant evidence may include:   38  AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015 5.4.1.1.  Personnel, training, medical, driving, and criminal records. 5.4.1.2.  Diagrams, drawings, maps, and models. 5.4.1.3.  Leases, licenses, and credentials. 5.4.1.4.  Photographs, videotapes, and voice recordings. 5.4.1.5.  Classified documents, videotapes, recordings, photographs, or other materials. 5.4.1.6.  Documents  (e.g.,  proprietary  information,  technical  orders,  design  manuals, handbooks,  etc.)  which  are  not  publicly  releasable  because  of  restrictions  under  federal law.  See Chapter 8 when including these documents in the report. 5.4.1.7.  Statutes, regulations, and government agency policy documents. 5.4.1.8.  Witness interviews.  See Chapter 6. 5.4.1.9.  Additional  testing  (e.g.,  metallurgy,  hydraulics,  simulator,  forensics,  control surfaces, etc.). 5.4.2.  Consider the following when reviewing evidence and preparing it for inclusion in the report: 5.4.2.1.  CVR and HUD Tapes.  The accident investigation reviews CVR and HUD tapes relevant  to  the  accident.    CVR  and  HUD  written  transcripts  are  publicly  releasable  and may  be  included  in  the  report.    Transcribe  the  CVR  and/or  HUD  tapes  as  soon  as practicable.    Do  not  provide  copies  of  CVR  and/or  HUD  tapes  containing  audio  to anyone outside the board unless authorized by AFLOA/JACC. information, 5.4.2.1.1.  Classified information  protected  from  public  release, inappropriate comments, and non-relevant conversations shall be redacted from CVR and/or HUD transcripts as necessary to protect national security or privacy interests.  Consult with the CA’s SJA for guidance. 5.4.2.1.2.  Upon  completion  of  the  investigation,  the  legal  advisor  or  recorder  shall forward  the  original  CVR  and  HUD  tapes  to  the  CA’s  SJA  for  storage  with  the additional evidentiary materials until AFLOA/JACC releases the wreckage from legal hold. 5.4.2.1.3.  The  video  and  audio  tapes  shall  not  be  released  to  the  public  unless specifically authorized by AFLOA/JACC. 5.4.2.1.4.  Requests  from  family  members  to  listen  to  CVR  and/or  see  HUD  tapes shall  be  forwarded  through  the  CA’s  SJA  to  AFLOA/JACC,  for  consideration pursuant  to  federal  law  and  regulations.    AFLOA/JACC  coordinates  with  the Administrative Law Directorate (AF/JAA). 5.4.2.2.  Sensitive AFIs, TOs, Maintenance Manuals, and Flight Manuals.   The accident investigation  may  gather  and  review  documents  that  are  restricted  from  public  release, such as documents protected by the Privacy Act  of 1974, the Arms Export Control Act, and  the  Export  Administration  Act  of  1979.    The  accident  investigation  will  frequently need  to  reference  excerpts  of  restricted  access  documents  in  the  tabs  to  support  factual information  in  the  report.    The  accident  investigation  must  obtain  written  permission from  the  proper  release  authority  before  including  restricted  information  in  the  report.  AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015   39  Contact  the  OPR listed on  the  cover  of  the  publication,  order,  or  manual.    See  AFI  61-204,  Disseminating  Scientific  and  Technical  Information,  for  further  guidance.    See Chapter 8 for additional guidance. 5.4.2.2.1.  Include  only  the  cover  page  and  the  minimum  excerpted  information necessary to support the Summary of Facts (and Statement of Opinion for AIBs). 5.4.2.2.2.  Submit  a  written  request,  email  or  otherwise,  to  the  named  OPR articulating  the  accident  investigation  produces  a  publicly-releasable  report  and  is requesting release authority for specific pages or excerpts from the document. 5.4.2.2.3.  If  the  OPR  grants  release  authority,  include  the  OPR’s  written  response along  with  the  releasable  excerpt  in  the  appropriate  tab  of  the  report.    Additionally, include a copy of the release authority’s response (with contact information intact) in the post-investigation memorandum.  If the OPR denies release authority, consult the CA’s SJA. 5.4.2.3.  Classified  Information.    Board  members  who  have  the  appropriate  security clearance may review classified evidence, as needed, during the investigation.  However, the  report  shall  not  contain  classified  information.    See  Chapter  8  for  further  guidance regarding classified addenda or Chapter 12 if a space investigation. 5.4.2.4.  Foreign  Evidence.    For  accidents  in  foreign  territories  or  involving  significant foreign interests, consult with the host installation’s SJA and the CA’s SJA or AF/JAO, for  procedures  to  gather  evidence,  gain  access  to  evidence,  or  request  evidence  from foreign military or civilian authorities. 5.4.2.5.  Medical Evidence.  The board reviews the relevant medical records pertaining to any  individual  involved  in  or  relevant  to  the  mishap.    Medical  evidence,  including medical  records,  autopsy  reports,  X-rays,  and  toxicology  reports,  should  be  obtained IAW  the  Health  Insurance  Portability  and  Accountability  Act  of  1996  (HIPAA)  (42 U.S.C 1320 et. seq.) and DoD 6025.18-R, DoD Health Information Privacy Regulation, 24 January 2003, from military and nonmilitary medical treatment facilities. 5.4.2.5.1.  Do  not  include  copies  of  medical  evidence  in  the  AIB  report  unless  that information is absolutely required to support the cause or a substantially contributing factor of the accident, and without first consulting the CA’s SJA. 5.5.  Safeguarding Evidence. 5.5.1.  The  accident  investigation  will  take  appropriate  steps  to  preserve  and  protect documents and other evidence, to  include wreckage, obtained during its investigation.  The accident investigation will safeguard classified evidence IAW AFI 31-401. 5.5.2.  Board  members  will  not  make  redactions  or  add  explanatory  remarks  to  original documents.  Instead, they will make alterations and redactions on photocopies and use only photocopies of the originals as working documents. 5.5.3.  Upon submission of the report to  the CA’s SJA for formal quality review, the board president  will  release,  return,  or  forward  all  evidence  IAW  this  publication.    The  legal advisor  ensures  he/she  receives  all  evidence  from  board  members  prior  to  departing  the accident investigation location.  Board members other than the legal advisor will not take any evidentiary items with them at the conclusion of the investigation.   40  AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015 Chapter 6 INTERVIEWING WITNESSES 6.1.  Interview Initial Steps. 6.1.1.  Establish a witness interview schedule and a process to track potential witnesses.  An interview should be conducted for each witness with relevant information. 6.1.1.1.  If  a  board  member  speaks  with  a  person  with  relevant  information,  and  that information is used in the Summary of Facts and/or the Statement of Opinion (for AIBs, and  for  GAIBs,  if  a  Statement  of  Opinion  is  authorized),  that  person  will  be  formally interviewed on the record.  An MFR or affidavit is not a legally sufficient alternative to incorporate  the  information  provided  by  the  witness  as  part  of  the  investigation  and support of the report. 6.1.1.2.  The board president  should consider the order in  which to  interview witnesses, and  whether  some  witnesses  should  be  interviewed  twice,  once  at  the  beginning  of  the investigation and again near the end of the investigation. 6.1.1.3.  The  interview  schedule  should  be  flexible  to  accommodate  a  witness’ availability and location, without causing an undue delay to the accident investigation. 6.1.1.4.  Interviews  should  be  conducted  in  person.    Interviews  may  be  conducted  by telephone  or  video  teleconference  (VTC)  when  an  in-person  interview  is  impossible  or impractical  because  the  witness  is  deployed,  on  TDY,  or  otherwise  unavailable.    When the interview is conducted by telephone or VTC: 6.1.1.4.1.  Inform all parties to the interview, both prior to and on the record, that the interview will be recorded. 6.1.1.4.2.  The witness must be informed that the testimony will be recorded with the accident investigation’s recording device.  Witnesses may not use their own recording device  to  record  the  interview.    If  the  witness  does  not  consent  to  being  recorded, contact the CA’s SJA for guidance. 6.1.1.4.3.  The board president or legal advisor shall take appropriate steps to confirm the witness’ identity on  the record.  These include having  a credible, unbiased third party verify the witness’ identity. 6.1.1.4.4.  If  the  interview  is  conducted  by  VTC,  only  the  audio  portion  of  the interview will be recorded.  Do not record any interview with video whether in person or when using VTC. 6.1.1.5.  When  scheduling  witness  interviews,  advise  witnesses  of  any  documents  or other items they should bring to the interview.  Such documents should be included in the report  as  attachments  to  the  witness’  testimony,  statement,  or  interview  summary,  if relevant to the testimony. 6.1.2.  Board members develop an interview script and questions designed to elicit additional information  to  aid  in  finding  the  cause(s)  and/or  substantially  contributing  factor(s)  (for AIBs) and drafting the report. AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015   41  6.1.2.1.  The  legal  advisor  reviews  the  board  members’  proposed  witness  questions ensuring  a  proper  flow  of  questions,  eliminating  opinion  or  irrelevant  questions  and questions  that  may  elicit  safety  privileged  information,  and  identifying  questions  that warrant a rights advisement. 6.1.3.  Prior to the start of the formal interview, the legal advisor or recorder conducts a pre-interview  briefing  with  the  witness.    The  following  topics  are  discussed  during  the  pre-interview: 6.1.3.1.  Explain the purpose of the accident investigation. 6.1.3.2.  Explain  the  differences  between  the  safety  investigation  and  the  accident investigation, to include the fact that the interview will be under oath. 6.1.3.2.1.  If a witness was interviewed by the safety investigation, inform the witness not to reference the SIB’s questions or his/her answers to the SIB (e.g., “Like I told the SIB”) during the accident investigation interview.  Board members must not know the  questions  asked  and  answered  during  a  SIB  interview  where  the  witness  was given a promise of confidentiality. 6.1.3.3.  Describe interview protocol. 6.1.3.3.1.  Inform  the witness the interview will be recorded and may be transcribed verbatim. 6.1.3.3.2.  A witness is prohibited from using his/her own recording device to record the  interview,  or  discussing  the  information  discussed  in  the  interview  without permission  of  the  board  president.    This  protects  information  from  being  released prematurely to the public and compromising the integrity of the investigation. 6.1.3.4.  Remind  the  witness  to  avoid  guessing,  speculation,  making  corrective  or disciplinary recommendations, or providing an opinion as to the cause(s) and/or factor(s) that substantially contributed to the accident. 6.1.3.4.1.  An expert witness may provide an opinion within his/her area of expertise.  However,  speculation  by  an  expert  witness  should  be  limited  to  the  facts  and circumstances surrounding the subject accident rather than fleet-wide concerns or Air Force-wide practices.  Be sure to ask for the factual basis of his/her opinion. 6.1.3.5.  Instruct  the  witness  to  refrain  from  using  technical  jargon  or  acronyms  during the interview since it may not be understood by the public. 6.1.3.5.1.  If  acronyms  and  technical  jargon  are  unavoidable,  ask  the  witness  to provide  definitions  or  an  explanation  on  the  record  and  list  the  acronyms  in  the Acronyms and Abbreviations section.  See Chapter 8. 6.1.3.6.  Instruct  witnesses  to  refrain  from  talking  with  their  hands,  since  non-verbal movements cannot be transcribed.  Tell the witnesses to answer “yes” or “no” rather than gesturing. 6.1.3.6.1.  If a witness describes distance with his/her hands, translate the distance for the record (e.g., “The witness is holding his hands approximately three feet apart.”).  As necessary, photograph gestures (without the witness’ face or identifying features) or models showing relative positions to preserve information for the record.   42  AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015 6.1.3.6.2.  If a witness refers to a diagram while testifying, ask him/her to mark where events or actions occurred.  Include the diagram or a photograph of the diagram in the witness’ transcript as an exhibit to the witness interview. 6.1.3.7.  Address witness concerns. 6.1.3.8.  Collect  witness  contact  information  (e.g.,  name,  address,  Social  Security Number  (SSN))  for  the  post-investigation  memorandum.    Do  not  collect  personal information during the recorded interview. 6.1.3.8.1.  Explain  that  gathering  this  personal  information  is  authorized  by  the Privacy  Act  of  1974  and  provide  each  witness  with  the  Privacy  Act  Statement  in Attachment 2. 6.2.  Witness Considerations. 6.2.1.  Military  members  and  DoD  civilian  employees  are  expected  to  cooperate  with  the accident  investigation,  to  include  being  interviewed  as  witnesses,  unless  they  assert  a  legal right or privilege not to do so.  Any witness who refuses to cooperate with the investigation without asserting a legal right or privilege not to do so should be informed that their refusal to  cooperate  will  be  referred  to  their  commander  for  consideration  of  disciplinary  or administrative action. 6.2.1.1.  The legal advisor should consult the host installation’s SJA for guidance before interviewing any DoD civilian employees who may be covered by a bargaining unit. 6.2.2.  DoD  contractor  employees  may  be  required  to  cooperate  with  the  accident investigation,  depending  on  the  terms  of  the  applicable  contract  or  applicable  Air  Force Instructions. 6.2.3.  Witnesses  shall  be  afforded  a  reasonable  opportunity  to  consult  with  an  attorney before, during or  after an accident investigation  board interview regardless  of whether they are considered a suspect. 6.2.3.1.  If  a  witness  is  known  to  be  represented  by  an  attorney,  the  legal  advisor  shall contact the attorney to arrange the interview rather than contacting the witness. 6.2.3.2.  If a military witness requests an attorney, the legal advisor shall provide contact information for the host installation’s area defense counsel (ADC).   IAW  AFI  41-210,  TRICARE  Operations  and  Patient 6.2.4.  Medical  Personnel. Administration,  and  DoD  6025.18-R,  DoD  Health  Information  Privacy  Regulation,  and HIPAA,  the  accident  investigation  is  authorized  to  interview  medical  personnel  regarding individuals involved in the mishap without the authorization of the individual. 6.2.4.1.  Most  statements  made  by  witnesses  to  medical  providers  (i.e.,  individuals  who do  not  have  the  authority  to  offer  a  promise  of  confidentiality)  are  not  considered privileged safety information and may be discussed during witness interviews. 6.3.  Interview Procedures. 6.3.1.  The  board  president  and  legal  advisor  shall  attend  all  witness  interviews.    All  other board members and SMEs may attend witness interviews at the board president’s discretion. AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015   43  6.3.2.  The board president may authorize board members and SMEs to question the witness during  the  interview.    However,  at  a  minimum,  the  board  president  must read  the  recorded preamble and interview concluding statement.  Should a rights advisement be necessary, the board president provides the advisement on the record after consulting with the legal advisor. 6.3.2.1.  Board  members  and  SMEs  who  ask  questions  during  the  interview  should identify  themselves  on  the  audio  recording  each  time  they  ask  a  question  or  make  a comment  ensuring  their  presence  and  participation  is  noted  on  witness  interview transcripts or summaries. 6.3.3.  The  accident  investigation  cannot  promise  an  AIB/GAIB  witness  that  his/her statement  to  the  AIB/GAIB  will  be  kept  confidential.    The  contents  of  all  interviews  are subject to public release except for classified information.  See Chapter 8 for restrictions on the release of classified information in the report. 6.3.4.  If a witness or board member requires a break at any point during the interview, pause the  recording  and  restart  when  the  interview  goes  back  on  the  record.    Do  not  record  the board’s side discussions during interview breaks. 6.3.5.  Interviewing SIB Witnesses. 6.3.5.1.  The  accident  investigation  does  not  interview  a  SIB  witness  until  the  SIB president releases that witness. 6.3.5.2.  The  accident  investigation  is  not  limited  to  interviewing  only  those  witnesses interviewed by the SIB, nor is the accident investigation required to interview all of the witnesses  interviewed  by  the  SIB.    However,  the  accident  investigation  attempts  to contact  all  SIB  witnesses  to  gauge  whether  the  witness  has  any  additional  relevant information. 6.3.5.3.  If  the  accident  investigation  chooses  not  to  interview  a  witness  who  was interviewed  by  the  SIB,  document  in  the  post-investigation  memorandum  witness  list why the SIB witness was not interviewed (e.g., redundant or irrelevant testimony, witness unavailable, etc.). 6.3.5.4.  If a witness begins to disclose privileged safety information, the interview must pause to remind the witness off the record of the prohibition against releasing privileged safety information. testimony  before 6.3.5.5.  If  witness the  accident investigation  should  ask  the  witness  under  oath  to  adopt  the  prior,  non-privileged,  SIB testimony,  so  as  to  make  it  a  sworn  statement,  before  proceeding  with  additional interview questions. the  SIB  was  non-privileged, 6.3.5.5.1.  The prior, non-privileged, SIB testimony should be referenced by interview date and length of document.  Also reference the specific page number(s) if included in Part 1 of the SIB (e.g., Tab R-6 to R-18). 6.3.5.5.2.  If  a  SIB  witness  interview  is  adopted  by  the  accident  investigation  but  a transcript or summary of the testimony is not included in Tab R, a transcribed copy of the  prior  recorded  testimony  shall  be  added  to  the  end  of  the  witness’  interview  in Tab V.   44  AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015 6.3.5.5.3.  The  accident  investigation  should  receive  a  recording  and/or  transcript  of the prior, non-privileged, SIB testimony. 6.4.  Recorded  Preamble.  The  recorded  preamble  consists  of interview introduction,  witness  oath  and  witness  introductory  questions.    Begin  recording  the  interview with the witness interview introduction and continue recording through the concluding statement, unless an intervening event occurs (e.g., breaks, rights advisement, discussion, etc.). the  witness 6.4.1.  Witness  Interview  Introduction.    Use  the  appropriate  introduction  for  witness interviews: 6.4.1.1.  Witnesses who testified before the SIB: My name is ___________.  I am/We are investigating the [aircraft/missile device/RPA/space vehicle/ground] accident that occurred on __________, near __________.  This investigation, conducted under AFI 51-503, is separate and apart from the safety investigation conducted under AFI 91-204.  This [ground] accident investigation board is a legal investigation that was convened to inquire into all facts and circumstances surrounding the [aerospace/ground] accident, to prepare a publicly-releasable report, and to obtain and preserve all available evidence for use in litigation, claims, disciplinary actions, adverse administrative actions, and for other purposes.  A safety investigation was previously conducted on this accident.  Any testimony you gave before the safety investigation board will be kept confidential, if you were so advised, and can be used only for mishap prevention purposes.  This board does not have access to any confidential testimony you gave before the safety investigation board.  You may not state that you gave any particular information to the safety board under a promise of confidentiality.  Your sworn testimony to the board may be used for any proper purpose.  Additionally, your testimony can be released to the public.  Do you understand the difference between your testimony before the safety board and this accident board? 6.4.1.2.  Witnesses who did not testify before the SIB: My name is ___________.  I am/We are investigating the [aircraft/missile device/RPA/space vehicle/ground] accident that occurred on __________, near __________.  This investigation, conducted under AFI 51-503, is separate and apart from the safety investigation conducted under AFI 91-204.  This [ground] accident investigation board is a legal investigation that was convened to inquire into all facts and circumstances surrounding the [aerospace/ground] accident, to prepare a publicly-releasable report, and to obtain and preserve all available evidence for use in litigation, claims, disciplinary actions, adverse administrative actions, and for other purposes.  A safety investigation was previously conducted on this accident.  You did not provide testimony or a statement to the safety investigation.  Your sworn testimony to the board may be used for any proper purpose.  Additionally, your testimony can be released to the public.  Do you understand how your testimony before this accident board may be used? 6.4.2.  Witness  Oath/Affirmation.    Accident  investigation  witnesses  testify  under  oath  or affirmation.    Military  members  and  DoD  civilian  employees  may  be  instructed  to  testify under oath/ affirmation.  Other witnesses not subject to military control may not be obligated to  provide sworn or affirmed testimony, but  the  board president should  attempt to  question them under oath/affirmation. AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015   45  6.4.2.1.  The  board  president  administers  the  oath  or  affirmation  to  the  witness  on  the record.    However,  if  necessary  any  active  duty  officer  or  active  duty  senior  non-commissioned officer may administer the oath/affirmation to the witness on the record. 6.4.2.2.  Administer the following oath/affirmation before questioning a witness: Do you solemnly swear/affirm that the testimony you are about to give in the matter now under investigation shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, [so help you God]? 6.4.2.2.1.  If a witness chooses to “affirm,” omit the word “solemnly” and phrase “so help you God” when administering the affirmation. 6.4.3.  Witness  Introductory  Questions.    After  administering  the  oath/affirmation,  the  board president identifies the date, time, place of interview, persons present, and states the witness has been sworn or affirmed.  He/She then asks the witness to state:  Full name, rank/grade, job  title,  present  duty  assignment,  location,  length  of  time  at  current  duty  assignment  and length of military service, if appropriate. 6.5.  Concluding the Witness Interview. 6.5.1.  The board president concludes each interview by instructing the witness on the record of the official nature of  the interview  and to  refrain  from  discussing his/her testimony  with anyone  without  the  board  president’s  permission  until  the  report  has  been  released  to  the public. 6.5.2.  Expect  to  recall  some  witnesses.    Subsequent  testimony  from  other  witnesses  may cause the board to seek clarification of previous testimony.  For this reason, ensure the board collects contact information from the witness in the event the witness is out of the area. 6.6.  Classified  Interviews.  Witnesses,  board  members,  SMEs,  and  court  reporters  must  be properly cleared before participating in classified interviews. 6.6.1.  Safeguard classified information IAW AFI 31-401.  Note:  A classified interview must be conducted using an appropriately classified recording device. 6.6.2.  If  classified  information  is  necessary  to  the  investigation,  conduct  two  separate interviews (one classified and one unclassified) and include as much unclassified testimony as possible in the unclassified portion of the report.  Classified information that is necessary to  the  investigation  will  be  placed  in  a  separate  classified  addendum  to  the  report.    This classified  addendum  will  not  be  released  to  the  public  as  part  of  the  accident  investigation report  and  will  be  forwarded  to  the  CA’s  SJA  using  appropriate  transfer  methods  at  the conclusion of the investigation. 6.6.3.  If a classified interview does not yield necessary information, do not transcribe it.  The accident investigation will forward the classified recording to the CA’s SJA IAW Chapter 9. 6.7.  Foreign National Interviews. 6.7.1.  Consult  with  the  CA’s  SJA  for  guidance  in  arranging,  conducting,  and  documenting interviews  with  foreign  military  personnel  and  foreign  nationals.    The  CA’s  SJA,  in  turn, consults with AF/JAO.   46  AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015 6.7.2.  The host installation’s SJA and host installation liaison may assist in arranging for an interpreter  to  participate  in  interviews  of  foreign  military  personnel  and  foreign  national witnesses as needed. 6.8.  Rights and Privileges of Witnesses. 6.8.1.  General Guidance. 6.8.1.1.  If a DoD witness not suspected of an offense invokes his/her right against self-incrimination, no member of the board will order the witness to answer a question until and unless the legal  advisor has obtained permission  to  do so from the CA’s SJA.  The CA’s SJA may want to consider consulting with or involving the witness’ command. 6.8.1.2.  Interviews should be attempted even if the board expects the witness to invoke his/her right against self-incrimination.  The invocation of this right must be made on the record and included in the appropriate tab. 6.8.1.3.  A  witness  may  have  his/her  attorney  present  during  the  accident  investigation interview for the sole purpose of advising the witness during the interview.  However, the witness’ attorney may not ask or answer questions on behalf of the witness.  If it becomes obvious  that  the  attorney  is  coaching  the  witness’  testimony,  pause  the  interview  and advise the attorney of the limitation of his/her role.  If it reoccurs, contact the CA’s SJA. 6.8.2.  Military Witnesses. 6.8.2.1.  Before  the  accident  investigation  questions  a  military  member  suspected  of committing  an  offense  punishable  under  the  Uniform  Code  of  Military  Justice  (UCMJ) (10 U.S.C. §§ 801-940), the military member must be advised of his/her rights provided by  Articles  31(a)  and  (b)  of  the  UCMJ.    All  rights  advisements  shall  be  made  on  the record.  Use the rights advisement at Figure 6.1. 6.8.2.1.1.  Article  31(a)  of  the  UCMJ  provides  that  no  person  subject  to  the  UCMJ may  compel  any  person  to  incriminate  him/herself  or  to  answer  any  questions  the answer to which may tend to incriminate him/her. 6.8.2.1.2.  Article  31(b)  of  the  UCMJ  provides  that  no  person  subject  to  the  UCMJ may interrogate, or request any statement from an accused or a person suspected of an offense without first  informing him/her of the nature of the  accusation and advising him/her  that  he/she  does  not  have  to  make  any  statement  regarding  the  offense  of which he/she is accused or suspected and that any statement made by him/her may be used as evidence against him/her in a trial by court-martial to incriminate themselves or answer any question the answer to which may tend to incriminate them. 6.8.2.2.  If suspicion of an offense punishable under the UCMJ arises after the interview begins,  the  interview  shall  be  stopped  as  soon  as  the  suspicion  arises,  and  the  military member will be advised  of his/her  rights in  Figure 6.1.   Contact  the CA’s SJA in  these circumstances  to  discuss  the  situation  and  determine  whether  the  nature  of  the  offense discovered may warrant a different type of investigation. 6.8.2.3.  If,  after  being  advised  of  his/her  Article  31,  UCMJ  rights,  the  military  witness requests a lawyer or elects to remain silent, the accident investigation interview shall stop and the board president refers the witness to the host installation’s ADC. AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015   47  6.8.2.3.1.  After  the  witness  has  had  a  reasonable  opportunity  to  consult  with  an attorney,  the  legal  advisor  shall  contact  the  witness’  attorney  to  inquire  whether  the witness  is  willing  to  testify.    If  the  witness  is  willing  to  testify,  the  board  president shall re-administer the rights advisement on the record before questioning the witness. 6.8.2.4.  If a military witness is not suspected of any offense punishable under the UCMJ but  the  witness  invokes  his/her  right  against  self-incrimination,  refer  the  witness  to  the host  installation’s  ADC.    After  the  witness  has  had  a  reasonable  opportunity  to  consult with  an  attorney, the legal  advisor contacts  the  witness’ attorney  to  inquire whether the witness is willing to testify. 6.8.2.5.  If there is not an ADC available at the host installation, or the servicing ADC is not available telephonically to speak with the witness, contact the host installation’s SJA to obtain contact information for other defense counsel the witness may contact. 6.8.2.6.  If,  after  rights  advisement  and  consultation  (if  requested)  with  an  attorney,  a military member suspected of committing an offense punishable under the UCMJ agrees to  provide  sworn  testimony,  then  the  following  statement  shall  appear  on  the  record immediately before the witness’ testimony: 6.8.2.6.1.  “Having been duly sworn and advised of the allegations, of [his/her] rights under Article 31, Uniform Code of Military Justice, and of [his/her] rights to counsel, and  having  acknowledged  [his/her]  understanding  of  those  rights,  and  having affirmatively waived those rights, the witness testified as follows:” 6.8.2.7.  For accidents involving AFRC and/or ANG personnel, the board must determine the duty status of the witness at the time of the accident and at the time of the interview.  The  determination  must  be  made  prior  to  the  interview  because  different  duty  statuses afford varying protections.  Include a copy of the witness’ orders, civilian or military pay stub, record of individual inactive duty training (Air Force (AF) Form 40a), or duty roster for drill days in the post-investigation memorandum. 6.8.2.7.1.  When AFRC and/or ANG personnel are suspected of an offense under the UCMJ or a violation of a criminal law, provide the appropriate rights advisement in Figure  6.1  or  Figure  6.2.    In  this  situation,  whenever  possible,  the  accident investigation  should  arrange  to  interview  the  witness  at  a  time  when  he/she  is  in federal military status. 6.8.3.  Federal Civilian Employee Witnesses. 6.8.3.1.  General Considerations. 6.8.3.1.1.  Consult  with  the  host  installation’s  SJA  and  a  labor  relations  officer  for guidance prior to interviewing federal civilian witnesses covered by a bargaining unit.  Note:  Many Air Reserve Technicians are represented by bargaining units. 6.8.3.1.2.  You may ask employees if they are members of a certified bargaining unit.  However,  it  is  improper  to  ask  employees  whether  they  belong  to  a  union  for purposes  of  determining  whether  they  have  Weingarten  rights.    This  question  is irrelevant  to  the  purpose  of  the  investigation.    See  paragraph  6.8.3.2.1.1  for  further information on Weingarten rights.   48  AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015 6.8.3.2.  Union Participation.  If a civilian employee is a member of a certified bargaining unit represented by a labor organization, a union official or representative may have the right to be present during the interview depending upon whether the interview constitutes a disciplinary examination or a formal discussion.  During a disciplinary examination, the employee  may  have  the  right  to  have  a  union  representative  present.    During  a  formal discussion, the union may have the right to have a union representative present.  Refer to paragraph  6.8.3.3.4  for  the  limitations  that  apply  to  union  officials  and/or  other representatives the witness wishes to have present during the interview. 6.8.3.2.1.  Disciplinary Examinations. 6.8.3.2.1.1.  If the employee is a member of a certified bargaining unit represented by  a  labor  organization  and  both  (1)  reasonably  believes  that  he/she  might  be disciplined as a result of the interview, and (2) requests union representation, then the  employee  is  entitled  to  have  a  union  official  or  steward  present  during  the interview.  This right is found in 5 U.S.C. § 7114(a)(2)(B), Rights and Duties of Agencies  and  Labor  Organizations,  and  is  frequently  referred  to  as  the employee’s  Weingarten  rights,  after  the  Supreme  Court  decision  in  National Labor Relations Board v. J. Weingarten, Inc., 420 U.S. 251 (1975). 6.8.3.2.1.2.  If the bargaining unit member requests union representation before or during the interview, the legal advisor should consult with the host installation’s SJA.    The  board  president’s  options  are  (1)  grant  the  request,  (2)  cancel  the interview, or (3) offer the employee the choice of either conducting the interview unaccompanied by a union representative or having no interview at all. 6.8.3.2.1.3.  The  right  to  the  presence  of  a  union  representative  at  a  disciplinary examination is the employee’s right, not the union’s right.  If the employee does not  ask  for  a  union  representative,  then  the  union  has  no  right  to  demand  that  a representative be present.  The right exists for all federal civilian employees who are members of a certified bargaining unit, whether they are members of the union or not. 6.8.3.2.1.4.  The Federal Sector Labor Management Relations Statute, 5 U.S.C. § 7114(a)(3),  Rights  and  Duties  of  Agencies  and  Labor  Organizations  does  not require  employee  notification  of  the  right  to  representation  prior  to  each interview.    Rather,  the  Statute  requires  management  annually  inform  its employees  of  this  right.    However,  some  local  union  contracts  stipulate  that management officials of an installation shall provide notice before each interview.  Exercise caution when interviewing federal civilian employees to ensure there are no  violations  of  the  terms  of  a  local  contract.    Consultation  with  the  host installation SJA at the location of the civilian witness is recommended. 6.8.3.2.2.  Formal Discussions. 6.8.3.2.2.1.  Under  the  provisions  of  the  Federal  Sector  Labor  Management Relations Statute, 5 U.S.C. § 7114(a)(2)(A), unions have a right to be given notice of  a  formal  discussion  between  one  or  more  agency  representatives  and  one  or more  bargaining  unit  employees.   However,  in  most  circumstances,  an investigatory  interview  with  a  civilian  bargaining  unit  employee  is  not  a  formal AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015   49  discussion that would require advance notice to the union and an opportunity for a union official to attend the interview.  This is because the labor statute provision only applies to discussions that concern a grievance, personnel policy or practice, or  other  general  condition  of  employment.    These  terms  are  defined  broadly  by the Federal Sector Labor Management Relations Statute, 5 U.S.C. § 7103.  These are  not  normally  the  subjects  of  an  accident  investigation  witness  interview, which  more  likely  would  seek  to  establish  an  employee’s  specific  actions, conduct,  and  observations  relevant  to  the  mishap  at  issue.    However,  questions about  workplace  actions,  the  workplace  atmosphere,  or  general  environment  of the  work  center  (e.g.,  how  often  did  personnel  use  government  owned  or  leased vehicles for personal use) are considered discussions about “general conditions of employment.” 6.8.3.2.2.2.  The  employee  must  be  advised  of  his/her  Brookhaven  rights  (e.g., certain  safeguards  set  out  by  the  Federal  Labor  Relations  Authority  to  protect employees  from  coercive  questioning  concerning  matters their statutorily protected rights).  See,  Internal Revenue Service v. National Treasury Employees Union, 9 FLRA No. 132 (1982). involving 6.8.3.2.2.3.  If  there  is  any  question  whether  an  interview  might  constitute  a formal  discussion,  which  would  require  union  notice,  the  legal  advisor  should consult  with  the  host  installation’s  SJA  or  the  Field  Support  Center,  General Litigation Division, Labor Law Field Support Center. 6.8.3.3.  Rights Advisements. 6.8.3.3.1.  If  the  accident  investigation  decides  to  interview  civilian  witnesses suspected of committing a violation of a civilian criminal law, consult the CA’s SJA for  guidance  on  how  and  whether  to  proceed  with  the  interview  and  whether  the interview  can  be  considered  a  custodial  interrogation.    The  Fifth  Amendment  to  the United  States  Constitution  provides  rights  to  persons  who  are  not  subject  to  the UCMJ  and  who  are  in  custody  by  law  enforcement  personnel  at  the  time  of questioning.    The  CA’s  SJA  should  consider  whether  to  consult  with  the  host installation’s SJA in order to determine whether or not civilian criminal investigators should  become  involved.    If  the  board  president  decides  to  interview  the  witness under  such  circumstances,  first  advise  the  witness  of  his/her  constitutional  right against self-incrimination.  See Figure 6.2. 6.8.3.3.2.  If  the  witness  is  willing  to  testify,  the  board  president  shall  re-administer the  rights  advisement  on  the  record  before  questioning  the  witness.    The  witness’ attorney may attend the interview and provide legal advice to the witness during the interview.  However, the attorney may not  ask or answer questions on behalf of the witness  and  may  not  interrupt  or  improperly  interfere  with  the  interview.    If  the attorney attempts to influence the witness testimony, pause the interview and advise the  attorney  on  the  limitations  of  his/her  role  and  continue  the  interview.    If  it reoccurs, pause the interview and consult with the CA’s SJA. 6.8.3.3.3.  If  after  rights  advisement,  the  civilian  employee  agrees  to  testify  under oath/ affirmation, then the following statement should appear immediately before the witness’ testimony:   50  AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015 6.8.3.3.3.1.  “Having  been  duly  sworn  and  advised  of  [his/her]  rights  under  the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and of [his/her] rights to counsel, and having acknowledged [his/her] understanding of those rights, and having affirmatively waived those rights, the witness testified as follows:” 6.8.3.3.4.  An  individual  may  have  both  union  representation  and  legal  counsel present  during  an  interview.    A  union  official,  steward,  other  representative,  or attorney attending an accident investigation witness interview may advise the federal employee who is being interviewed, but may not ask or answer questions on behalf of the witness, and may not interrupt or improperly interfere with the interview.  If the representative  or  attorney  attempts  to  influence  the  witness  testimony,  pause  the interview  and  advise  him/her  on  the  limitations  of  his/her  role  and  continue  the interview.  If it reoccurs, pause the interview and consult with the CA’s SJA. 6.8.4.  DoD Contractor Employee Witnesses. 6.8.4.1.  The  board  president  may  choose  to  have  an  Air  Force  contract  management representative  present  when  interviewing  employees  of  DoD  contractors.    The  contract management  representative  may  be  able  to  help  obtain  company  records,  company policies, and applicable contract provisions.  In addition, the representative may provide assistance  if  the  employee  contends  that  rights  under  a  contractor’s  labor-management agreement  are  being  abridged.    Review  the  provisions  of  the  government  contract addressing  the  obligations  of  contractor  personnel  (if  any)  to  cooperate  and  provide information  to  the  accident  investigation.    Furthermore,  the  legal  advisor  should determine whether the contractor’s general counsel or management must be involved or contacted to arrange the witness interview. 6.8.4.2.  Rights  Advisements.    Follow  the  guidance  in  paragraphs  6.8.3.3.1  through 6.8.3.3.3.1 above. 6.8.5.  Other Witnesses. 6.8.5.1.  Civilian  witnesses  who  are  not  federal  employees  or  employees  of  government contractors  may  refuse  to  speak  with  and/or  provide  sworn  testimony  to  the  accident investigation and cannot be compelled to do so. 6.8.5.1.1.  The board president, at his/her discretion, should allow other witnesses to bring  appropriate  advisors  to  an  interview.    However,  only  the  board  members  may ask questions, and only the witness may answer questions during the interview.  The limitations in paragraph 6.8.3.3.4 apply. 6.8.5.2.  Rights Advisements. 6.8.5.2.1.  If  the  accident  investigation  decides  to  interview  civilian  witnesses suspected of committing a violation of a civilian criminal law, consult the CA’s SJA for  guidance  on  how  to  proceed.    If  after  consultation  with  the  CA’s  SJA  and  the appropriate  legal  authorities  the  civilian  witness  will  be  interviewed,  follow  the guidance in paragraphs 6.8.3.3.1 through 6.8.3.3.3.1 above.  The Fifth Amendment to the  United  States  Constitution  provides  rights  to  persons  who  are  not  subject  to  the UCMJ  and  who  are  in  custody  by  law  enforcement  personnel  at  the  time  of questioning.    The  CA’s  SJA  should  consider  whether  to  consult  with  the  host AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015   51  installation’s SJA in order to determine whether or not civilian criminal investigators should  become  involved.    If  the  board  president  decides  to  interview  the  witness under  such  circumstances,  first  advise  the  witness  of  his/her  constitutional  right against self-incrimination.  See Figure 6.2. 6.8.5.3.  Consult  the  CA’s  SJA  for  guidance  on  interviewing  foreign  military  personnel and foreign nationals the accident investigation interviewer suspects, or comes to suspect, of  acting  in  violation  of  United  States  (federal  and  state)  criminal  laws  or  the  criminal laws  of  the  witness’  country  of  citizenship.    The  CA’s  SJA  should  coordinate  with AF/JAO. 6.9.  Verbatim  or  Summarized  Testimony.  Preserve  all  witness including telephonic  and  VTC  testimony,  with  an  audio  recording.    Thereafter,  testimony  can  be transcribed verbatim or summarized and signed under oath by the witness. testimony, 6.9.1.  Verbatim Testimony.  If the witness’ testimony is critical or provides a large amount of  evidence  for  the  report,  have  the  recording  transcribed  verbatim.    Consider  transcribing verbatim  the  testimony  of  any  witness  on  whose  testimony  the  board  president  relies  on his/her Statement of Opinion (for AIBs). 6.9.1.1.  When preparing verbatim transcripts, double space between questions.  Number all  questions  and  answers  using  the  following  format:    “Q1”  for  the  first  question  and “A1” for the first answer, “Q2” for the second question and “A2” for the second answer, and  so  on.    Be  sure  verbatim  transcripts  clearly  identify  the  individuals  who  are  asking and answering each question.  See Attachment 2 for verbatim transcript template. 6.9.1.2.  Air  Force  court  reporters  should  be  used  to  transcribe  audio  recordings  of witness interviews.  The legal advisor or recorder should contact the Air Force Judiciary, Air Force Legal Operations Agency (AFLOA/JAJ) for Air Force court reporter support.  If an Air Force court reporter is required to be physically present for witness interviews or  AFLOA/JAJ  cannot  support  the  board,  contact  CA’s  SJA  for  assistance.    No  person that provided transcription services for the safety investigation will provide transcription services for the accident investigation. 6.9.2.  Summarized Testimony.  If only a small portion of the testimony is valuable, or if in the  opinion  of  the  board  president,  exact  words  are  not  important,  the  board  president  may elect to summarize the witness’ testimony. 6.9.2.1.  If  the  accident  investigation  elects  to  summarize  a  witness’  testimony,  draft  a coherent, accurate summary of the relevant portions of the interview.  See Attachment 2 for a recommended format for summarized testimony. 6.9.2.2.  The witness’ identity must be confirmed, and he/she must sign the summarized statement  as  a  sworn  statement  in  the  presence  of  an  active  duty  officer  or  active  duty senior non-commissioned officer. 6.9.2.3.  If a witness declines to sign a summarized statement on the grounds it does not accurately reflect his/her testimony, review the audio recording with the witness to reach an agreement on what the witness said.  If you cannot reach an agreement, transcribe the testimony verbatim.   52  AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015 6.9.3.  The board must complete a quality review of verbatim and summarized transcripts to ensure all technical terminology and transcription is correct. Figure 6.1.

General Considerations.  Early release of information involves any release of information prior to the official public release of the approved report. 7.1.1.  Conducting  a  thorough  and  timely  investigation  is  a  high  priority  for  the  Air  Force, NoK,  seriously  injured  personnel,  and  the  public.    Procedures  and  policy  for  releasing information  are  IAW  10  U.S.C.  §  2254,  Treatment  of  Reports  of  Aircraft  Accident Investigations, and this publication. 7.1.2.  Unauthorized  Disclosure  of  Mishap  Information.    Unauthorized  disclosure  of information  or  documents  gathered  during  the  accident  investigation  compromises  the integrity of the accident investigation process. 7.1.3.  Specific Prohibition.  Prior to the official public release of the report, board members, SMEs,  contractors,  and  federal  government  employees  who  have  been  given  or  have obtained  access  to  accident  investigation  information  or  documents  shall  not  disclose  that information  or  the  contents  of  the  report  for  other  than  official  and  authorized  purposes.  Prior to public release of the report, the only authorized disclosures of accident investigation information  or  the  contents  of  a  report  shall  be  for  the  purpose  of  facilitating  the  accident investigation.  Failure to  observe the prohibition in  this paragraph by  active duty  Air Force members, AFRC members on active duty or inactive duty for training, or ANG members in federal service is a violation of Article 92, UCMJ.  Violations by federal civilian employees may  result  in  administrative  disciplinary  actions  without  regard  to  otherwise  applicable criminal or civil sanctions for violations of related laws. 7.1.3.1.  This  prohibition  does  not  preclude  the  accident  investigation  board  from disclosing information  on a limited basis to  further the board’s investigation or to  write the  accident  investigation  report;  this  disclosure  does  not  include  releases  to  NoK  or seriously injured personnel, media releases, or other similar releases of public disclosure.  Anyone to whom information is disclosed IAW this paragraph will be instructed by the accident investigation board to not disclose it IAW this publication. 7.1.3.2.  No member of the AIB/GAIB will discuss the accident investigation nor release any substantive information  related to  the accident  investigation to  anyone in  the safety community  prior  to  approval  of  the  accident  investigation  report  unless  specifically approved by the CA, in consultation with the CA’s SJA. 7.1.3.3.  All other disclosures of investigation information must be specifically approved by the CA. 7.2.  Release of Information. 7.2.1.  Prior  to  an  accident  investigation  board  president  being  appointed,  command authorities  may  release  initial  information  regarding  the  accident  (e.g.,  date/time/location, number  of  casualties  if  any,  emergency  response  activities,  status  of  SAR,  recovery  of remains, salvage operations, etc.).  Care must be exercised to not release information that can compromise the integrity of any Air Force accident investigations.  See Attachment 2.   54  AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015 7.2.2.  Once  appointed,  the  accident  investigation  board  president,  or  other  CA  designee (e.g.,  PA),  shall  be  the  Air  Force  representative  for  the  public  release  of  all  information regarding the investigation after first obtaining approval from the CA or CA’s SJA.  Under no circumstances, will any member of the safety investigation board or the safety community release  any  investigation  information  to  the  NoK,  seriously  injured  personnel,  media, Congress, or any other member of the public. 7.2.3.  Release of information to NoK and seriously injured personnel. 7.2.3.1.  Releasing  information  to  NoK  or  seriously  injured  personnel  constitutes  public release. 7.2.3.2.  It is important to keep the NoK and seriously injured personnel  apprised of the status of the safety and accident investigations.  The NoK and seriously injured personnel will receive periodic updates through the FAR(s) or other designee.  The board president or  legal  advisor  contacts  the  FAR(s)  when  there  is  a  change  in  status  of  the  accident investigation. 7.2.3.3.  In  relaying  information  to  the  NoK  or  seriously  injured  personnel  use  the appointed  FAR(s),  or  designee,  rather  than  the  board  president  or  board  members  to convey  the  information.    Board  members  shall  only  have  contact  with  the  NoK  or seriously  injured  personnel  to  initially  introduce  him/herself  (board  president  only),  to conduct formal interviews, or to perform post-investigation briefings. 7.2.3.4.  Any information that has been approved for public release shall be provided to the NoK or seriously injured personnel prior to the information being released to anyone else in the general public  See paragraph 7.3.2.1 below. 7.2.4.  If  the  accident  involved  personnel  from  other  MAJCOMs,  other  DoD  components, allied  forces,  or  prominent  public  officials,  it  may  be  necessary  or  appropriate  to  advise and/or  coordinate  with  organizations  and  officials  outside  the  CA’s  command  prior  to releasing investigation information to the public.  The accident investigation board consults with  the  CA’s  SJA,  who,  in  turn,  should  contact  AFLOA/JACC  and/or  AF/JAO  for additional guidance. 7.3.  High-Interest Mishaps. 7.3.1.  High-interest  mishaps  include  those  that  result  in  death  or  serious  personal  injury, significant  civilian  property  damage,  or  are  likely  to  generate  high  public,  media,  or congressional interest.  See paragraph 1.5.2 for further guidance on high-interest mishaps. 7.3.2.  Release  of  accident  investigation  information  in  high-interest  mishaps  (other  than information  that  solely  relates  to  the  status  of  the  investigation)  requires  Headquarters  Air Force notification prior to public release. 7.3.2.1.  If the first release of status information on the investigation substantially follows the example found in  Attachment 2,  and no specific investigation information is  added, the Headquarters Air Force notification requirement of paragraph 7.3.2 does not apply. 7.3.2.2.  Prior  to  releasing  any  investigation  information  (other  than  information  that solely relates to  the status  of the investigation) to  the NoK, seriously injured personnel, and  the  public,  the  CA’s  SJA  shall  forward  the  information  approved  by  the  CA  for public  release  by  e-mail  to  AFLOA/JACC  for  distribution  through  the  Office  of  The AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015   55  Judge  Advocate  General  (AF/JA)  to  the  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  (SecAF),  the  Air Force Chief of Staff (AF/CC) and/or their designees for their review. 7.3.2.3.  Unless  otherwise  determined  by  competent  authority,  upon  receipt,  SecAF  and AF/CC  and/or  their  designees  shall  have  four  duty  days  to  review  the  information  after which AFLOA/JACC shall notify the CA’s SJA public release can proceed.  The NoK or seriously injured personnel shall be provided any information that has been approved for public release prior to the information being released to anyone else. 7.4.  Public  Requests  of  Early  Release  of  Substantive  Information.  Except  as  noted  in paragraphs 7.2.3.3 and 7.3.2, upon receipt of a public request for investigation information prior to  public  release  of  the  approved  report,  the  CA  can  authorize  public  disclosure.    Prior  to authorizing  a  public  disclosure,  the  below  requirements  of  10  U.S.C.  §  2254  must  be  met.  However,  the  below  requirements  do  not  limit  the  CA’s  authority  to  release  investigation information prior to public release of the report when the CA deems it appropriate. 7.4.1.  The information is requested; and 7.4.2.  The information will be included in the releasable report; and 7.4.3.  The  release  of  such  information  will  not  undermine  the  ability  of  safety  or  accident investigators to continue to conduct the investigation; and 7.4.4.  The release of such information will not compromise national security.   56  AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015 Chapter 8 THE REPORT 8.1.  Overview. 8.1.1.  The board president documents the facts and circumstances surrounding the accident in  the  report.    For  AIBs,  (and  for  GAIBs,  if  AFLOA/JACC  authorizes  a  Statement  of Opinion), the president  also  writes a Statement of Opinion  reflecting his/her  opinion of the cause(s) and/or substantially contributing factor(s). 8.1.2.  The report is arranged in the following sequence: 8.1.2.1.  Cover page. 8.1.2.2.  Action of the CA (added by the CA’s SJA). 8.1.2.3.  Executive Summary. 8.1.2.4.  Summary  of  Facts  (with  Table  of  Contents  and  List  of  Acronyms  and Abbreviations). 8.1.2.5.  Statement  of  Opinion  (for  AIBs,  and  for  GAIBs,  if  a  Statement  of  Opinion  is authorized). 8.1.2.6.  Index of Tabs. 8.1.2.7.  Tabs. 8.1.3.  Each of the narrative sections (Executive Summary, Summary of Facts, and Statement of Opinion for AIBs) shall be a self-contained, stand-alone document.  Each section shall: 8.1.3.1.  Reiterate  the  facts  of  the  mishap  to  the  extent  necessary  for  that  particular section  (e.g.,  basic  facts  in  the  Executive  Summary,  thorough  discussion  of  facts  in Summary  of  Facts,  and  facts  that  clearly  support  the  cause(s)  and/or  substantially contributing  factor(s)  for  the  Statement  of  Opinion  for  AIBs,  and  for  GAIBs,  if  a Statement of Opinion is authorized). 8.1.3.2.  Define acronyms used in each separate narrative section. 8.1.3.3.  Explain aviation and technical concepts used in each separate narrative section. 8.1.3.4.  If using a pseudonym (e.g., position of a person like mishap pilot or MP), use the same  pseudonym  throughout  the  entire  report,  including  the  narrative  sections, statements, interviews and tabs. 8.1.4.  Report  Format.    The  report  format  described  in  this  chapter  is  applicable  for  all accident  investigations.    Modify  it  only  to  the  extent  allowed  in  this  chapter,  Chapter  11 (abbreviated AIB), Chapter 12 (space mishap), and Chapter 13 (additional GAIB guidance).  In  all  other  cases  the  report  format  may  not  deviate  from  the  format  described  in  this publication without a specific waiver from AFLOA/JACC. 8.2.  Assembling the Report. 8.2.1.  Assemble the completed report on 8 1/2 inch x 11 inch paper secured on the left side in a three-ring binder.  If there are multiple volumes, label the volumes (e.g., 1 of 2, 2 of 2). AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015   57  8.2.2.  The  cover  page,  Executive  Summary,  Summary  of  Facts,  Statement  of  Opinion  (for AIBs, and for GAIBs, if a Statement of Opinion is authorized), and Index of Tabs for a report shall be single sided.  The tab sections should be double sided. 8.2.3.  Ensure the tabs are formatted to be printed out double sided (e.g., if the tab ends on an odd page, insert “Intentionally Left Blank” and page number on the next page). 8.2.4.  All  pages of the report (excluding the Cover Page, Executive Summary, and Tabs A through  S)  shall  have  a  centered  two  line  footer.    Line  one  shall  be  in  11  point  italicized Times  New  Roman  font  indicating  the  airframe/asset,  tail  number/identifying  number,  and date  of  the  mishap.    Line  two  shall  be  in  11  point  (not  italicized)  Times  New  Roman  font with the page number or tab page number.  A sample is as follows: MQ-1B Predator, T/N XX-XXXXXX, 1 January 2002 17 8.2.4.1.  Use the following page number convention for the report: 8.2.4.1.1.  Cover Page and Executive Summary are not numbered. 8.2.4.1.2.  Table of Contents and Acronyms and Abbreviations sections are numbered with consecutive lower case Roman numerals (e.g., i, ii, iii, etc.). 8.2.4.1.3.  Summary  of  Facts,  Statement  of  Opinion  (for  AIBs,  and  for  GAIBs,  if  a Statement  of  Opinion  is  authorized),  and  Index  of  Tabs  are  numbered  with consecutive Arabic numerals (e.g., 1, 2, 3, etc.). 8.2.4.1.4.  Tabs  are  numbered  with  the  tab  letter  followed  by  a  dash  and  the  Arabic numeral corresponding with the page (e.g., W-1, W-2, etc.), except for Tab V. 8.2.4.1.4.1.  Tab  V  page  numbers  distinguish  between  each  witness.    Number each  witness  with  “V”  followed  by  a  dash  and  the  Arabic  numeral  assigned  to each  witness,  and  then  a  decimal  point  followed  by  the  Arabic  numeral  page number corresponding to the transcript (e.g., V-1.1, V-1.2, V-1.3, V-1.4, etc.). 8.2.5.  The SIB Part 1 portion included in the report may have a different header/footer, and the board shall not alter it, except as follows: 8.2.5.1.  If the SIB Part 1 does not include page numbers, the accident investigation shall add page numbers so the report may reference a page number in Tabs A through S. 8.2.5.2.  If a tab in  the SIB Part 1 ends on an odd page, the accident investigation shall add an additional page stating “Intentionally Left Blank” and page number so if the report is printed, it is clear to the public this page was intended to be left blank. 8.2.5.3.  If  the  SIB  Part  1  lists  a  separate  disc,  nonpublic  website,  or  file  without including the information in the Part 1, the accident investigation board shall include the actual content of the SIB’s referenced materials in a separate tab after Tab S.  Following the  title  or  link  in  the  SIB  Part  1,  an  insertion  in  brackets  will  be  added  directing  the public to the page(s) where the substantive information is located.  However, audio files of the mishap crew/personnel will not be released in the report. 8.2.6.  The  accident  investigation  may  create  additional  tabs  after  Tab  BB  if  needed.  Subsequent tab categories after Tab BB are at the board’s discretion.   58  AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015 8.2.7.  All information redacted within the tabs must be white in color. 8.3.  Publicly-Releasable  Report.  Include  only  publicly-releasable  information  in  the  report.

The  opinion  must  be  clear,  complete,  and  concise  when  stating  an opinion as to cause(s) and/or substantially contributing factor(s) in the mishap (as required by 10 U.S.C. § 2254(c), which only applies to aerospace investigations).  It is a stand-alone document without  reference  to  the  Executive  Summary  or  Summary  of  Facts.    The  opinion  is  the  board president’s alone and is publicly releasable as part of the AIB report. 8.8.1.  Liability and Litigation.  The opinion is not considered an admission of liability by the United States or by any person referred to therein, and may not be considered as evidence in any  civil  or  criminal  proceeding  arising  from  the  aerospace  accident.    See  10  U.S.C.  § 2254(d).    At  the  beginning  of  the  Statement  of  Opinion,  include  the  statement  provided  in paragraph 8.4.8. 8.8.2.  Scope of the Statement of Opinion.  The opinion contains a brief recap of the mishap mission and identifies the cause(s) and/or substantially  contributing factor(s) in  the mishap.  Any opinion as to cause(s) or substantially contributing factor(s) shall be supported by facts stated in the Summary of Facts, which must be supported by evidence included in the tabs. AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015   67  8.8.3.  Standard of Proof.  The standard of proof shall be the preponderance of the evidence.  Preponderance  of  the  evidence  is  credible  evidence,  which,  as  a  whole,  shows  that  the  fact sought  to  be  proved  is  more  probable  than  not.    In  other  words,  a  preponderance  of  the evidence means such evidence as, when considered and compared with the evidence opposed to it, has more convincing force, and produces in your mind’s belief that what is sought to be proved is more likely true than not true. 8.8.4.  Cause.  A cause is an act, omission, condition, or circumstance that starts, sustains, or creates  a  condition  permitting  the  mishap,  without  which  the  mishap  could  not  have occurred.    It  may  be  an  element  of  human,  environmental,  mechanical  performance  or  a combination  thereof.    A  given  act,  omission,  condition,  or  circumstance  is  a  “cause”  if correcting, eliminating,  or avoiding it would have prevented the mishap.    In other  words, a factor is causal if “but for” that factor taking place, the mishap would not have occurred. 8.8.4.1.  The  board  president  provides  an  opinion  regarding  the  cause(s)  of  the  mishap only when a preponderance of the evidence supports the causal opinion. 8.8.4.2.  Each individual mishap cause cited must be supported by a preponderance of the evidence. 8.8.4.3.  The  board  president  consults  with  the  legal  advisor  to  determine  if  available credible evidence meets the preponderance of the evidence standard of proof. 8.8.4.4.  The legal standard must be clearly stated (e.g., “I find by a preponderance of the evidence the cause of the mishap was…”). 8.8.5.  Substantially  Contributing  Factors.    A  substantially  contributing  factor  is  an  act, omission, condition, or circumstance that played an important role, directly or indirectly, in the mishap, but its correction, elimination, or avoidance would not, by itself, have prevented the mishap. 8.8.5.1.  If  the  board  president  is  unable  to  determine  a  cause,  he/she  shall  describe  the factors, if any, which substantially contributed to the mishap.  In cases where the board president  is  able  to  determine  the  cause(s)  of  the  mishap,  he/she  may  also  attribute substantially contributing factors. 8.8.5.2.  Explain the connection between each individual substantially contributing factor and the mishap. 8.8.5.3.  Each  individual  substantially  contributing  factor  must  be  supported  by  a preponderance of the evidence. 8.8.5.4.  The  legal  standard  must  be  clearly  stated  (e.g.,  “I  find  by  a  preponderance  of evidence that each of the following factors substantially contributed to the mishap…”). 8.8.6.  Evidence  Considered.    When  weighing  the  evidence,  consider  all  available  credible evidence including: 8.8.6.1.  Direct evidence (e.g., actual knowledge or observation of witnesses). 8.8.6.2.  Indirect  evidence  (e.g.,  using  facts  or  statements  from  which  reasonable inferences,  deductions,  and  conclusions  may  be  drawn  to  establish  an  unobserved  fact, knowledge, or state of mind).  This is also known as circumstantial evidence.   68  AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015 8.8.7.  Weighing Evidence.  The weight of the evidence is not determined by the number of witnesses or documents but by considering all the evidence and evaluating the totality of the circumstances  such  as  a  witness’  behavior,  opportunity  for  knowledge,  information possessed,  ability  to  recall  and  relate  events,  bias,  reliability,  and  relationship  to  the  matter being considered. 8.8.7.1.  The board must consider the credibility of all the evidence when discussing the potential cause(s) and/or substantially contributing factor(s). 8.8.8.  Signature and Date.  The board president shall date and sign the Statement of Opinion with  his/her  name  and  signature  block  as  “President,  [Ground]  Accident  Investigation Board.”    This  occurs  when  the  report  is  submitted  for  formal  quality  review.    The  board president  may  sign  the  document  electronically  in  lieu  of  using  a  “wet  ink”  signature.  Because  reports  are  posted  online,  it  is  recommended  the  board  president  sign  the  report electronically. 8.9.  Index of Tabs.  The Index of Tabs follows the Statement of Opinion for AIBs and follows the  Summary  of  Facts  for  GAIBs  (unless  the  GAIB  is  authorized  to  contain  a  Statement  of Opinion).  See Attachment 2. 8.10.  Tabs  for  Accident  Investigation  Boards.  See Chapter 11 for information regarding the tabs for abbreviated AIBs and Chapter 13 for information regarding the tabs for GAIBs. 8.10.1.  Tabs A through S of the report shall be identical to Part 1 of the SIB report (Tabs A through S), except as otherwise authorized pursuant to this publication or by AFLOA/JACC waiver on a case-by-case basis. 8.10.1.1.  Any  additional  evidence  gathered  by  the  accident  investigation  that  would logically fit under Tabs A through S shall be placed separately in the AIB investigation tabs (Tabs T to BB).  If additional tabs are needed, the accident investigation may create tabs starting with Tab CC. 8.10.2.  The  board  must  obtain  written  permission  before  including  documents  or  excerpts from documents subject to the Arms Export Control Act and the Export Administration Act of 1979 (e.g., maintenance documents, including flight manuals, maintenance manuals, TOs, and TCTOs).  Include this written permission for release with the document excerpt(s). 8.10.3.  Original  documents  reviewed  by  the  AIB  should  be  properly  safeguarded.    Do  not make any marks on the original documents.  Make alterations and redactions on copies using appropriate software. 8.10.4.  Do  not  attach  tab  markers  for  individual  documents  within  each  tab.    However, include a table of contents on the first page of each tab.  See Attachment 2. 8.10.5.  Include the following tabs in the AIB report.  See Chapter 13 for tabs included in the GAIB report: 8.10.5.1.  Tab A - Safety Investigator Information 8.10.5.2.  Tab B - Not Used 8.10.5.3.

Observe  Privacy  Act  provisions  of AFI 33-332 and do not include items that constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy  under  DoD  5400.7-R_AFMAN  33-302.    Also,  limit  injury  or  death  details  to information  sufficient  to  support  the  findings  and  conclusions.    Avoid  graphic descriptions  of  trauma  or  injuries.    Do  not  include  the  autopsy  report.    Be  mindful  of potential NoK sensitivities.  The medical member should draft a general MFR indicating the  cause  of  death  or  injury  and  describe  any  abnormal  laboratory  test  results  or  other medical factors affecting crew performance. 8.10.5.25.  Tab Y -  Legal Board Appointment Documents.  This includes all documents that  appoint  AIB  members  and  details  AIB  SME(s).

This tab includes instructions, regulations, operating instructions, manuals, permits, licenses, and other documents  issued by appropriate  government authorities, to include Air Force officials.    It  only includes policy  and/or  guidance documents that are relevant and applicable to the accident being investigated. 8.10.5.28.1.  When including documents in this tab, include the cover page and only the page(s) from the document which are referenced in the report. 8.10.5.28.2.  Ensure  the  documents  included  in  this  tab  are  the  version  that  was current at the time of the mishap and are not restricted from public release. 8.11.  Informal Quality Review. 8.11.1.  The purpose of the informal quality review is to quickly assess whether the report is clear, understandable, and accurate and to identify any major deficiencies in the investigation or  analysis  in  time  for  the  board  president  to  make  changes  or  continue  the  investigation should he/she wish to do so while the accident investigation is still in place. 8.11.2.  Informal Quality Review for High-Interest Mishaps.  The accident investigation shall forward a draft of the Executive Summary, Summary of Facts, and Statement of Opinion (for AIBs,  and  for  GAIBs,  if  a  Statement  of  Opinion  is  authorized)  to  the  CA’s  SJA  for  an informal quality review.  The CA’s SJA may request the tabs at his/her discretion. 8.11.2.1.  The  CA’s  SJA,  at  his/her  discretion,  may  elect  to  forward  the  draft  to AFLOA/JACC for assistance with the informal quality review.  If the CA’s SJA elects to forward  the  draft  to  AFLOA/JACC,  AFLOA/JACC  reviews  it  and  provides  comments back  to  the  CA’s  SJA.    The  CA’s  SJA  is  not  required  to  accept  or  forward  any AFLOA/JACC comments to the board president. 8.11.2.2.  Regardless of whether AFLOA/JACC assists with the informal quality review, the CA’s SJA must independently review the report and provide his/her own comments to  the  board  president  within  three  duty  days  of  his/her  receipt  or  one  duty  day  from his/her receipt of any comments from AFLOA/JACC, whichever occurs later. 8.11.3.  Informal Quality Review for Non High-Interest Mishaps.  The accident investigation shall  forward  a  draft  of  the  Executive  Summary,  Summary  of  Facts,  and  Statement  of Opinion (for AIBs, and for GAIBs, if a Statement of Opinion is authorized) to the CA’s SJA for an informal quality review.  The CA’s SJA may request the tabs at his/her discretion. 8.11.3.1.  The CA’s SJA shall review the report and provide his/her own comments to the board president within three duty days of his/her receipt. 8.11.4.  All comments will be provided through the CA’s SJA to the board president through the legal advisor and will NOT be attributed to any individual.  Staff officials, other than the SJA  or  his/her  representative,  shall  not  communicate  directly  in  any  way  with  the  board concerning  the  content  of  the  report  prior  to  approval  of  the  report.    The  CA’s  SJA  or  any member  of  his/her  staff  that  has  received  any  privileged  safety  information  from  the preceding safety investigation will not communicate directly or indirectly with any member of the board, nor will they review the report prior to approval. 8.11.5.  Undue  Influence.    It  is  imperative  the  board  president,  members,  and  SMEs  not  be subjected to actual or perceived undue influence by anyone, to include the CA, his/her staff, AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015   71  or any individual or organization superior to the board president, members or SMEs.  Undue influence might be manifested by an attempt to direct the board president to reach a specific opinion or conclusion, improperly influence the board president, or mandate changes to the report or the perception thereof.  However, the prohibition against undue influence does not prohibit  a  CA  from  communicating  directly  with  the  board  president  receiving  periodic updates of the board’s progress, requesting consideration of new evidence, or presenting for the  board  president’s  consideration  alternative  opinions  and  hypotheses  interpreting  the evidence.    The  CA’s  SJA  may  communicate  directly  or  indirectly  with  the  legal  advisor concerning  the  content  of  the  report,  including  arranging  “operator-to-operator”  or  “expert-to-expert” discussions when necessary to resolve concerns raised during the review.  Despite these  possibilities,  the  CA  and  the  CA’s  SJA  must  take  precautions  to  ensure  there  is  no appearance of anyone unduly influencing the accident investigation board. 8.12.  Sending the Report to the Convening Authority’s SJA. 8.12.1.  The accident investigation shall mail (via civilian courier) the original report and as many  copies  (paper  and  electronic)  as  specified  by  the  CA’s  SJA.    If  the  CA’s  SJA  only requires an electronic version of the report, send it through secure means. 8.12.2.  The report shall not be mailed through the military postal system.   72  AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015 Chapter 9 POST-INVESTIGATION MATTERS 9.1.  Personal  Notes  and  Drafts.  After  the  CA  approves  the  report,  the  board  president  will instruct all board members and SMEs to destroy all investigation-related notes, emails, and draft reports.  Following approval of the report, the only investigation-related records that shall exist are  the  approved  report,  items  (e.g.,  original  documents,  wreckage,  etc.)  returned  to  the appropriate host installation units, and ancillary documents/evidence forwarded to the CA’s SJA with the post-investigation memorandum. 9.2.  Post-Investigation  Memorandum.  The  post-investigation  memorandum  serves  as  a formal record of transmittal of all investigative documents and evidence to the CA’s SJA. 9.2.1.  The  investigation  process  is  not  complete  until  board  members  and  SMEs  have returned  original  records  to  the  proper  custodians,  transferred  custody  of  wreckage,  and forwarded the post-investigation memorandum with all ancillary documents/evidence to the CA’s SJA. 9.2.2.  The  post-investigation  memorandum  consists  of  a  cover  letter  with  attachments.    It should  be  properly  marked  “PERSONAL  DATA  –  PRIVACY  ACT  OF  1974  (5  U.S.C.  § 552a)”  in  recognition  of  witness  and  board  members/SMEs  personal  information.    See Attachment 2. 9.2.3.  Attachments.  Attach and forward to the CA’s SJA the following documents/evidence to the post-investigation memorandum: 9.2.3.1.  Evidence  Inventory  List.

Include  in  each  box  a  complete inventory list.  See Attachment 2 for a sample inventory list. 9.2.3.3.  Classified  Evidence.    If  a  classified  interview  was  conducted  or  there  is classified  evidence,  mark  the  classified  information  appropriately  and  forward  the classified  information  separately  IAW  proper  guidance  for  forwarding  classified information. AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015   73  9.2.3.3.1.  After classified documents have been reviewed, if no pertinent information is  found  relating  to  the  investigation,  and  they  are  not  used  to  support  the  report  in any way, return the items to their respective organization or source. 9.2.3.4.  Forward  a  certified  copy  of  the  ATC  tapes  IAW  AFI  51-301,  Civil  Litigation, Chapter  8.

Include copies of memoranda  documenting  transfer  of  any  specific  parts  for  laboratory  testing  or  repairs, and  the  contact  information  of  the  custodian.    Include  any  AFLOA/JACC  memoranda approving early disposal of the wreckage. 9.2.3.8.  If the board president approved release of non-wreckage pieces of evidence (e.g., personal property of the mishap pilot unrelated to the mishap), attach any documentation indicating the item released and its recipient. 9.2.3.9.  Record  Transmittal  Letters.    Include  copies  of  letters  reflecting  the  return  of medical, dental, personnel, flight, maintenance, or other records to the original custodian.  Ensure  the  letters  include  the  full  address  of  the  unit  or  person  to  whom  records  were returned  and  the  custodian’s  signed  acknowledgment.    See  Attachment  2  for  a  sample records transmittal letter. 9.2.3.10.  TCM  Approval  Letters.    Include  letters  and/or  emails  approving  the  inclusion in  the  report  of  TO  excerpts,  engineering  analysis  reports,  contractor  proprietary information, FOUO documents, or other documents that are subject to the Arms  Export Control Act,  the Export  Administration  Act  of 1979, or other proprietary protections or protection from public release. 9.2.3.11.  Witness  List.    Include  a  consolidated  list  of  witnesses,  including  full  names, units,  SSNs,  Defense  Switch  Network  (DSN),  commercial  duty  and  home  telephone numbers,  and  duty  address.    If  the  board  chose  not  to  interview  a  SIB  witness,  also include  the  reason  why  the  witness  was  not  interviewed  (e.g.,  redundant  or  irrelevant testimony, witness unavailable, etc.).  A sample witness list is at Attachment 2. 9.2.3.12.  AFRC and ANG duty orders and/or any  other proof of duty status.   Include a copy of each AFRC and ANG witness’ duty orders from the time and date of the mishap and date of the accident investigation interview.   74  AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015 9.2.3.13.  Board  members  and  SMEs.    Include  a  list  of  board  members  and  SMEs, including  full  names,  board  positions,  DSN,  commercial  duty  and  home  telephone numbers, and duty address.

Forward the post-investigation memorandum and ancillary documents/evidence to the CA’s  SJA  no  later  than  15  calendar  days  of  forwarding  the  completed  report  to  the  CA’s SJA. 9.2.5.  The  CA’s  SJA  maintains  a  copy  of  the  post-investigation  memorandum  until AFLOA/JACC releases the entire wreckage from legal hold. 9.3.  Disposition of the Report, Documents, Evidence, and Other Materials.  The CA’s SJA: 9.3.1.  Stores  the  AIB/GAIB  report  with  original  signatures  for  a  period  ending  three  years from  the  date  of  the  mishap,  and  then  retires  it  to  the  appropriate  Federal  Records Center/National  Archives  and  Records  Administration  office.    The  report  is  destroyed  25 years  from  the  date  of  the  mishap,  unless  it  is  deemed  historically  significant  by  either  the CA or AFLOA/JACC. 9.3.1.1.  If  the  report  was  signed  electronically,  the  CA  has  the  discretion  to  store  the report in electronic format rather than in paper copy. 9.3.2.  Stores  all  ancillary  non-privileged  documents  and  other  non-wreckage  evidence (including  photographs)  gathered  by  the  safety  and  accident  investigations  until  released from legal hold. the  CVR  and  other  voice  communication 9.3.3.  Retains tapes  for  storage  until AFLOA/JACC  releases  the  wreckage  from  legal  hold.    Do  not  release  CVR  tapes  or  other voice  communication  tapes,  HUD  tapes  containing  audio,  or  copies  of  tapes,  without  the approval of AFLOA/JACC. 9.3.4.  Ensures  the  retention  of  classified  HUD  tapes  by  the  appropriate  office  at  the MAJCOM  or  NAF  until  AFLOA/JACC  releases  the  wreckage  from  legal  hold.    See paragraph 9.2.3.3.1, if applicable. 9.3.5.  Responds  to  requests  for  copies  of  the  report.    Because  the  accident  investigation report is prepared to be fully releasable to the public, approved copies of the report will not be altered or further redacted prior to release to the public. 9.3.6.  Once released from legal hold, returns the ancillary documents/evidence to the source agency or disposes of them IAW applicable regulations. 9.4.  Wreckage Custody, Removal, Storage and Disposal. 9.4.1.  Wreckage Custody.  Immediately after the mishap, custody of the wreckage is vested first  in  the  incident  commander.    (The  incident  commander,  at  his/her  discretion,  transfers custody of the wreckage to the SIB president at the start of the SIB.    The SIB president then transfers custody of the wreckage, in writing after conclusion of the safety investigation, to the accident investigation board president.  After the wreckage is no longer required for the accident  investigation,  the  board  president  transfers  custody  of  the  wreckage,  in  writing,  to AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015   75  the host installation commander or designee.  If there is NWRM in the wreckage, the board president  will  notify  the  local  NWRMAO  of  any  NWRM  that  has  been  transferred  to  the installation commander or designee. 9.4.1.1.  In the event an accident investigation has not been convened by the time the SIB has concluded its investigation, the SIB, through the CA’s Chief of Safety, contacts  the CA’s SJA to determine whether an accident investigation will be convened, and if so, the SIB transfers custody of the wreckage and non-privileged safety evidence to  the person or office designated by the CA’s SJA.  If no accident investigation will be convened, the CA’s SJA in  consultation with  AFLOA/JACC, determines whether the evidence should be retained in anticipation of litigation, and if so, determines where the evidence will be stored  and  retains  the  appropriate  chain  of  custody  documentation.    If  no  accident investigation  will  be  convened,  and  no  litigation  is  reasonably  anticipated,  the  SIB transfers the wreckage and evidence IAW the instruction of the CA’s SE. 9.4.2.  Wreckage Removal and Storage.  The host installation commander, or other custodian designated  by  the  CA,  is  responsible  for  removing,  storing  and  preserving  wreckage transferred  to  his/her  custody  by  the  board  president.        The  CA,  at  his/her  discretion,  may fund removal and storage of the wreckage. 9.4.3.  Wreckage Disposal.  Once released from legal hold, the host installation commander disposes of the wreckage in compliance with applicable disposal instructions.    Consult with the  appropriate  logistics  directorate  for  further  information.    If  there  is  NWRM  in  the wreckage,  ensure  compliance  with  AFI  20-110  by  returning  any  NWRM  to  the  local NWRMAO for proper disposition. 9.5.  Request  for  Wreckage  Release.  Wreckage  from  Class  A  mishaps  (except  for  those covered by paragraphs 9.5.1 and 11.6) must be retained and preserved until specifically released from legal hold by AFLOA/JACC. 9.5.1.  For a Class A mishap that resulted solely in damage to government property and did not  involve loss/destruction  of an Air  Force  asset,  the CA’s SJA may release the wreckage from legal hold once the report has been approved. 9.5.2.  If the request for release of wreckage is initiated prior to the approval of the accident investigation report, then the board president and the CA or designee shall concur  with  the wreckage  release  request  to  ensure  the  release  will  not  compromise  the  integrity  of  the investigation before forwarding to AFLOA/JACC for approval. 9.5.3.  After the accident investigation has completed its investigation, wreckage requests for release from legal hold are submitted through the host installation’s SJA and the CA’s SJA to AFLOA/JACC. 9.5.4.  Provide the following information in wreckage release requests: 9.5.4.1.  Date of accident. 9.5.4.2.  Type and tail number of aircraft, RPA, missile, or space vehicle or identification number of the asset involved. 9.5.4.3.  Location of accident. 9.5.4.4.  Persons killed and status of injured personnel.   76  AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015 9.5.4.5.  Estimate of the number, types, and dollar amount of claims anticipated or filed. 9.5.4.6.  Whether there is a mission requirement for immediate release of the wreckage. 9.5.5.  A release from legal hold by AFLOA/JACC is not a disposal authorization.  Those in possession  of  the  wreckage  must  further  comply  with  applicable  disposal  instructions.  Consult with the appropriate logistics directorate for further information. 9.6.  Request for Authorization to  Repair Aircraft, RPA,  Missile, Space Vehicle, or Other Asset.  No aircraft, RPA, missile, space vehicle or other asset involved in a Class A mishap shall be repaired and returned to service until AFLOA/JACC releases it from legal hold.  However, if the  mishap  resulted  solely  in  damage  to  government  property  and  did  not  involve  the loss/destruction of the asset, the CA’s SJA may authorize repair and return to service. 9.7.  Release  of  Aero  Club  Aircraft  Wreckage  and  Ancillary  Documents/Evidence.  Retain all  Aero  Club  aircraft  mishap  wreckage  and  ancillary  documents/evidence  for  NTSB investigation  if  the  mishap  involved  a  fatality  or  serious  personal  injury,  the  aircraft  was destroyed, or the mishap may result in a claim or litigation. 9.7.1.  The  Aero  Club  aircraft  may  not  be  repaired  and  returned  to  service  until AFLOA/JACC releases it from legal hold. 9.7.2.  All  documents  and  evidence  gathered  during  the  Aero  Club  investigation  shall  be released  from  legal  hold  at  the  same  time  AFLOA/JACC  releases  the  wreckage  from  legal hold. 9.7.3.  Send  written  requests  for  release  from  legal  hold  to  AFLOA/JACC,  with  an informational  copy  to  the  Services  Law  Division,  Office  of  the  Staff  Judge  Advocate,  Air Force Personnel Center, Joint Base San Antonio-Randolph, Texas.  Provide the information listed in paragraph 9.5.4. 9.7.4.  Release from legal hold from AFLOA/JACC is not a disposal authorization.  Those in possession  of  Aero  Club  wreckage  must  coordinate  with  Community  Programs  Branch, Directorate of Services, Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC/SVPCR) for guidance on proper disposal/disposition of the wreckage. 9.8.  Accident  Site  Remediation.  For  information  concerning  environmental  remediation,  see AFI  32-7020,  The  Environmental  Restoration  Program,  or  if  overseas,  see  AFI  32-7001, Environmental Management.  Questions regarding accident site restoration, as well as obtaining access  to  the  accident  site  when  the  owner  of  the  property  denies  access,  may  be  directed  to AFLOA/JACE-FSC. 9.9.  Allegations  Against  Senior  Officials  or  Colonels  (or  Civilian  Equivalent).  Following approval of the report, if there is information or an allegation made against a senior official or a colonel  (or  civilian  equivalent),  the  CA’s  SJA  notifies  the  CA.    If  the  CA  determines  it  to  be reportable, immediately reports it to the Air Force Inspector General’s Senior Official Inquiries Directorate  (SAF/IGS)  as  required  under  AFI  90-301.    The  CA  may  notify  intermediate commanders. 9.10.  Changes  to  the  Accident  Investigation  Report  after  Approval.  After  the  accident investigation report has been approved, no material changes can be made to the report unless the CA formally reopens the investigation in order to make the desired modifications.  If the accident investigation  is  reopened  to  make  changes,  the  CA  must  accomplish  a  new  action,  which  also AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015   77  indicates  that  the  investigation  was  reopened  to  make  changes  to  the  report.    Material  changes are  any  changes  to  the  report  other  than  fixing  grammatical  and  typographical  errors.    See paragraph 10.4 for further information on reopening an investigation.   78  AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015 Chapter 10 APPROVAL, DISTRIBUTION OF THE ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION REPORT AND NEXT-OF-KIN BRIEFINGS 10.1.  Formal Quality Review and Legal Review. 10.1.1.  General considerations.  The formal quality review is part of the CA’s SJA’s formal staffing of the completed report immediately prior to approval by the CA.  During the formal quality review the CA’s SJA analyzes format and content of the report for compliance with this  publication,  checking  all  citations  for  accuracy  and  ensuring  non-releasable  or inappropriate information is not included in the report. 10.1.1.1.  Prior to the CA’s approval, the report shall not be provided to any intermediate commands,  officials,  and  organizations  outside  the  DoD,  or  the  public,  except  as otherwise mandated by international agreement or other applicable legal requirement. 10.1.1.2.  At  the  discretion  of  the  CA’s  SJA,  a  TCM  can  review  the  report  to  confirm technical data included in the report is approved for public release. 10.1.2.  Formal  Quality  Review.    The  board  president  initiates  the  approval  process  by sending,  through  the  legal  advisor,  the  completed  report  to  the  CA’s  SJA.    The  CA’s  SJA provides  the  report  to  the  appropriate  staff  offices,  as  determined  by  the  CA  (and  to AFLOA/JACC for high-interest mishaps) for review and comment. 10.1.2.1.  The formal quality review and legal review process should be completed in 30 days. 10.1.2.2.  High-Interest Mishap Format Quality Review. 10.1.2.2.1.  The CA’s staff offices will review the report and provide their comments back to the CA’s SJA within the time established by the CA’s SJA.  AFLOA/JACC will provide its comments  back to  the CA’s SJA within five duty days of receipt of the complete report.  Any delay beyond this time period will be communicated to the CA’s  SJA.    AFLOA/JACC’s  comments  will  be  limited  to  the  narrative  language, advising  whether  it  is  logical,  supportable  on  its  face,  and  compliant  with  this publication. 10.1.2.2.2.  The CA’s SJA must independently review the report and provide his/her own  comments  along  with  the  comments  received  from  AFLOA/JACC  and  CA’s staff  offices,  back  to  the  board  president,  through  the  legal  advisor.    No  comment should  be  attributed  to  any  particular  individual,  but  may  be  identified  by  the originating organization or office (e.g., AFLOA/JACC, A3/5, or JA).  Staff comments are not publicly releasable and are not incorporated into the report. 10.1.2.2.2.1.  Neither staff officials, nor anyone else, other than the SJA or his/her representative, shall communicate directly in any way with the board concerning the content of the report prior to approval of the report. 10.1.2.2.3.  The  board  president  must  consider  the  comments  before  finalizing  the report.  Based upon the comments received, the board president may elect to continue AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015   79  the  investigation,  modify  the  report  accordingly,  or  make  no  changes  to  the  report.  The legal advisor advises the CA’s SJA of the course of action. 10.1.2.2.4.  The CA’s SJA receives the revised report, completes a final legal review, and  should  forward  the  report  to  the  CA  within  30  days  of  the  start  of  the  formal quality review.  The legal review assesses whether the report meets the requirements of this publication and therefore is legally sufficient.  The legal review is forwarded with the report to the CA, but is not publicly releasable and is not incorporated into the report. 10.1.2.3.  Non High-Interest Mishap Formal Quality Review. 10.1.2.3.1.  The CA’s staff offices will review the report and provide their comments back to the CA’s SJA within the time established by the CA’s SJA. 10.1.2.3.2.  The CA’s SJA must independently review the report and provide his/her own comments along with the comments received from the CA’s staff offices, back to the board president, through the legal  advisor.   No comment  should be  attributed to any  particular  individual,  but  may  be  identified  by  the  originating  organization  or office  (e.g.,  A3/5,  or  JA).    Staff  comments  are  not  publicly  releasable  and  are  not incorporated into the report. 10.1.2.3.2.1.  Neither staff officials, nor anyone else, other than the SJA or his/her representative, shall communicate directly in any way with the board concerning the content of the report prior to approval of the report. 10.1.2.3.3.  The  board  president  must  consider  the  comments  before  finalizing  the report.  Based upon the comments received, the board president may elect to continue the  investigation,  modify  the  report  accordingly,  or  make  no  changes  to  the  report.  The legal advisor advises the CA’s SJA of the course of action. 10.1.2.3.4.  The CA’s SJA receives the revised report, completes a final legal review, and  should  forward  the  report  to  the  CA  within  30  days  of  the  start  of  the  formal quality review.  The legal review assesses whether the report meets the requirements of this publication and therefore is legally sufficient.  The legal review is forwarded with the report to the CA, but is not publicly releasable  and is not incorporated into the report. 10.2.  Undue  Influence.  It  is  imperative  the  board  president,  members,  and  SMEs  not  be subjected to actual or perceived undue influence by anyone, to include the CA, his/her staff, or any  individual  or  organization  superior  to  the  board  president,  members  or  SMEs.    Undue influence  might  be  manifested  by  an  attempt  to  direct  the  board  president  to  reach  a  specific opinion  or  conclusion,  improperly  influence  the  board  president,  or  mandate  changes  to  the report  or  the  perception  thereof.    However,  the  prohibition  against  undue  influence  does  not prohibit a CA from communicating directly with the board president receiving periodic updates of  the  board’s  progress,  requesting  consideration  of  new  evidence,  or  presenting  for  the  board president’s  consideration  alternative  opinions  and  hypotheses  interpreting  the  evidence.    The CA’s SJA may communicate directly or indirectly with the legal advisor concerning the content of the report, including arranging “operator-to-operator” or “expert-to-expert” discussions when necessary to resolve concerns raised during the review.  Despite these possibilities, the CA and   80  AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015 the  CA’s  SJA  must  take  precautions  to  ensure  there  is  no  appearance  of  anyone  unduly influencing the accident investigation board. 10.3.  Approval  of  the  Report.  The  CA  reviews  the  report,  decides  whether  to  approve  the report  as  written  or  return  it  to  the  board  president  for  further  action.    Approval  of  the  report indicates  the  accident  investigation  and  resulting  report  complied  with  applicable  laws  and regulations.  For AIBs and for GAIBs, if a Statement of Opinion is authorized, approval by the CA does not indicate that the CA agrees with the board president’s Statement of Opinion.  If the CA  finds  the  report  to  be  legally  insufficient  he/she  may  opt  to  not  approve  the  report  and convene another investigation. 10.3.1.  The CA should not approve the report with comments since the comments would not fall within the purview of 10 U.S.C. §2254(d). 10.3.2.  Upon  approval  of  the  report,  the  CA’s  SJA  shall  prepare  the  CA’s  action  on  the report  IAW  the  format  in  Attachment  2.    Once  signed  by  the  CA,  the  document  shall  be placed under the front cover of the report and distributed with the report. 10.3.3.  Upon  the  CA’s  approval  of  the  report,  the  CA’s  SJA  may  reduce  the  report  to  an electronic  file.    However,  NoK  and  seriously  injured  personnel  shall  be  offered  both  hard copies and electronic versions of the report. 10.4.  Reopening  the  Accident  Investigation.  Following  approval  of  the  report,  the  CA  has discretion  to  reopen  the  accident  investigation  upon  discovery  of  previously  unknown  material evidence or evidence that in the board president’s opinion could affect the Statement of Opinion (for AIBs, and for GAIBs, if a Statement of Opinion is authorized). 10.4.1.  The CA reopens the accident investigation by issuing a convening order to the board president in a format similar to the order that initially convened the accident investigation. 10.4.2.  The  order  that  reopens  the  investigation  will  specify  the  scope  of  the  accident investigation’s additional investigation and the format the board president will use to report the results of the additional investigation. 10.4.3.  The  order  will  identify  which  board  members  or  SMEs  are  recalled  or  newly appointed.  At a minimum, the new order will specify a board president and legal advisor. 10.5.  Informational  Briefing.  If  the  CA  requests  a  formal  briefing  of  the  report  prior  to  its approval,  the  board  president,  with  the  approval  of  the  CA,  may  provide  an  informational briefing to the NAF commander (or civilian equivalent) before briefing the CA.  In addition, the CA  may  invite  the  mishap  wing  commander  to  be  present  at  the  informational  briefing.    The purpose of this informational briefing is solely to prepare the intermediate commander(s) for the formal briefing with the CA. 10.6.  Distributing the Accident Investigation Report: 10.6.1.  High-Interest Mishaps. 10.6.1.1.  If the report involves a high-interest mishap, the following documents must be forwarded  by  e-mail  to  AFLOA/JACC  immediately  following  approval  of  the  report.  The documents forwarded to AFLOA/JACC (known as the high-interest mishap package) shall  not  be  released  until  after  the  briefings  to  the  NoK  and/or  seriously  injured personnel. AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015   81  10.6.1.1.1.  A “CONTROLLED UNCLASSIFIED INFORMATION.  NOT APPROVED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE.” prominently displays cover sheet that 10.6.1.1.2.  The cover page of the report. 10.6.1.1.3.  The CA’s action. 10.6.1.1.4.

A description of public, press, and congressional interest. 10.6.1.1.8.3.  A press release and anticipated questions and answers. 10.6.1.2.  Upon receipt of all the aforementioned documents, AFLOA/JACC will prepare and  deliver  a  high-interest  mishap  package  to  AF/JA  for  forwarding  to  the  offices  of SecAF and AF/CC for review. 10.6.1.2.1.  No  one  shall  contact  the  NoK  and/or  seriously  injured  personnel  to schedule a briefing until AFLOA/JACC informs the CA’s SJA it is permissible to do so.    This  will  normally  occur  four  duty  days  after  the  offices  of  SecAF  and  AF/CC receive the  complete  high-interest  mishap  package  from  AF/JA;  however, circumstances may extend this four-duty day period. 10.6.1.3.  After  AFLOA/JACC  informs  the  CA’s  SJA  that  the  NoK  and/or  seriously injured personnel briefings may be scheduled, the CA’s SJA may forward a copy of the CA’s  Action,  Executive  Summary,  Summary  of  Facts,  and  Statement  of  Opinion  (for AIBs,  and  for  GAIBs,  if  a  Statement  of  Opinion  is  authorized)  to  the  following  offices (annotate  on  each  report  copy  “CLOSE  HOLD  UNTIL  PUBLIC  RELEASE”)  prior  to briefing NoK and/or seriously injured personnel or public release of the report. 10.6.1.3.1.  The  CA’s  Chief  of  Safety  if  a  SIB  was  convened  to  investigate  the mishap.    Annotate  on  the  transmittal  document  that  no  comments  made  or  actions taken by safety personnel as a result of their review of the report are to be disclosed outside  the  Air  Force  Safety  Community.    Under  no  circumstances  shall  any information concerning any differences between the two investigations be relayed by anyone in the safety community to the accident investigation board or the CA’s SJA.  Any concerns identified by the safety community shall be communicated directly to the CA. 10.6.1.3.2.  AFSEC/JA. 10.6.1.3.3.

Foreign military commanders and civilian authorities as appropriate. 10.6.2.  Non High-Interest Mishaps. 10.6.2.1.  After the CA approves the report, the CA’s SJA coordinates with the CA’s PA for report distribution. 10.6.2.2.  After  the  report  is  approved,  the  CA’s  SJA  shall  e-mail  a  copy  of  the  CA’s Action,  Executive  Summary,  Summary  of  Facts,  and  Statement  of  Opinion  (for  AIBs, and for GAIBs, if a Statement of Opinion is authorized) to AFLOA/JACC.  Annotate on the e-mail that the report is “CLOSE HOLD UNTIL PUBLIC RELEASE.” 10.6.2.3.  In  addition  to  the  above  and  prior  to  release  of  the  report  to  the  public  or  the media, provide a copy of the CA’s Action, Executive Summary, Summary of Facts, and the  Statement  of  Opinion  (for  AIBs,  and  for  GAIBs,  if  a  Statement  of  Opinion  is authorized) to the following offices.  Annotate on the transmittal document that the report is “CLOSE HOLD UNTIL PUBLIC RELEASE.” 10.6.2.3.1.  The  CA’s  Chief  of  Safety  if  an  SIB  was  convened  to  investigate  the mishap.    Annotate  on  the  transmittal  document  that  no  comments  made  or  actions taken by safety personnel as a result of their review of the report are to be disclosed outside  the  Air  Force  Safety  Community.    Under  no  circumstances  shall  any information concerning any differences between the two investigations be relayed by anyone in the safety community to the accident investigation board or the CA’s SJA.  Any concerns identified by the safety community shall be communicated directly to the CA. 10.6.2.3.2.  AFSEC/JA. 10.6.2.3.3.  Mishap wing commander and intermediate commanders. 10.6.2.3.4.

Foreign military and civilian authorities, as appropriate. 10.7.  High-Interest Mishaps:  Briefings to Next-of-Kin and/or Seriously Injured Personnel. 10.7.1.  Before public release of the report, brief the accident investigation to the NoK and/or seriously injured personnel.  The CA may, within his/her discretion, direct briefings for other close relatives or friends of the deceased member(s).  The board president will be the primary briefing officer. 10.7.1.1.  NoK  and  seriously  injured  personnel  briefings  shall  not  be  audio/video recorded.  Telephonic or video-conferenced briefings are strictly prohibited. 10.7.2.  The briefing to the NoK and/or seriously injured personnel is to: 10.7.2.1.  Personally express the condolences of the Department of the Air Force for the death or injury resulting from the mishap; AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015   83  10.7.2.2.  Personally deliver a copy of the report (either a hard copy, an electronic copy or both depending on the wishes of the NoK and/or seriously injured personnel); and 10.7.2.3.  Provide a basic briefing of the investigation, including the cause(s)  and/or the substantially contributing factor(s) in the mishap for AIBs (and for GAIBs, if a Statement of Opinion is authorized), and to answer briefing recipients’ questions. 10.7.3.  Multiple NoK and/or seriously injured personnel briefings. 10.7.3.1.  If  there  are  multiple  NoK  and/or  seriously  injured  personnel,  the  CA  will determine whether the board president will conduct all briefings in person, or if multiple briefing  officers  will  be  appointed  to  conduct  simultaneous  briefings  in  person.    If multiple  briefing  officers  are  appointed,  they  will  be  field  grade  officers  and  should  be board  members  when  possible.    The  legal  advisor  will  not  attend  the  briefing,  unless authorized by AFLOA/JACC. 10.7.3.2.  Each  recipient  shall  receive  substantially  the  same  briefing.    Therefore,  each briefing officer must fully understand the results of the accident investigation and clearly brief it based on a uniform briefing plan.  If multiple briefing officers are used, they will not deviate from the approved briefing plan. 10.7.3.3.  If  multiple  briefings  are  scheduled  but  will  not  occur  at  the  same  time,  the briefing officer will ask briefing recipients to refrain from talking to the media or public about  matters  that  were  briefed  until  after  completion  of  scheduled  briefings.    The purpose of the request is to ensure the last individuals briefed receive factual information from the briefing officer before they receive it from other sources (e.g., other individuals who were briefed, the media, etc.). 10.7.4.  The  CA’s  SJA  shall  provide  training  to  Air  Force  personnel  who  will  conduct  the briefings.    Representatives  from  other  members  of  the  CA’s  headquarters  staff  (e.g.,  PA, Mental  Health,  Casualty  Assistance,  Mortuary  Affairs,  Surgeon  General,  etc.)  provide training, as appropriate. 10.8.  High-Interest Mishaps:  Congressional and Other Briefings. 10.8.1.  Following  the  briefings  to  the  NoK  and/or  seriously  injured  personnel,  but  before public  release,  provide  a  copy  of  the  report  and  a  briefing  to  congressional  members,  if requested.    Contact  the  Air  Force  Legislative  Liaison  Program  (SAF/LLP)  for  further guidance. 10.8.2.  If  the  mishap  involved  personnel  from  other  MAJCOMs,  other  DoD  components, allied  forces,  or  prominent  public  officials,  additional  briefings  may  be  necessary  or appropriate before public release, but shall follow the briefings to the NoK and/or seriously injured personnel.  Consult with the CA’s SJA and CA’s PA for assistance in identifying and coordinating these additional briefings. 10.9.  Subsequent Report Distribution in All Mishaps.

Requests for Copies of the Approved Report. 10.10.1.  The CA is the official release authority for the report and responds to requests for copies of the report. AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015   85  Chapter 11 ABBREVIATED ACCIDENT INVESTIGATIONS 11.1.  General  Considerations.  At  the  CA’s  discretion,  an  abbreviated  investigation  may  be conducted pursuant to this chapter allowing for the investigation procedures and report format to be  modified  to  conserve  time  and  resources.    Unless  specifically  addressed  in  this  chapter, compliance  with  the  rules  and  procedures  in  the  remaining  chapters  of  this  publication  is mandatory. 11.2.  Convening an Abbreviated Accident Investigation Board.  Abbreviated AIBs shall only be  convened  under  the  below  circumstances.    (See  Chapter  13  for  circumstances  in  which abbreviated  GAIBs  may  be  convened.    If  an  abbreviated  GAIB  is  convened,  it  is  convened pursuant to this chapter and the provisions in this chapter apply.) 11.2.1.  When  an  AIB  is  required  pursuant  to  paragraph  1.5  and  the  mishap  is  not  a  high-interest mishap, involves an RPA (other than a sub-scale RPV) or a Full Scale Aerial Target Remotely Piloted Vehicle (FSAT RPV), and claims and litigation are not likely or expected to arise from the mishap. 11.2.1.1.  If  during  an  abbreviated  investigation,  it  becomes  apparent  that  a  rights advisement  is  necessary,  the  CA’s  SJA  should  consider  whether  to  continue  with  an abbreviated investigation, convene a full investigation, or terminate the investigation and refer the matter to other investigative channels. 11.2.2.  When  convening  an  AIB  is  discretionary.    See  paragraph  1.6  regarding  factors  to consider when determining whether to convene a discretionary AIB. 11.3.  Abbreviated Accident Investigation Member Qualifications. 11.3.1.  The board president should be in  a grade equal  to,  or greater than, the grade of the corresponding  SIB  president  or,  in  the  case  of  a  single  SIB  investigator,  the  accident investigation board president shall at a minimum be a field grade officer. 11.3.2.  An  abbreviated  accident  investigation  shall  have  a  president  and  legal  advisor.  Consider appointing a recorder, other board members, and SMEs, as needed. 11.3.3.  The board president must be a graduate of the BPC. 11.3.4.  The legal advisor shall be a graduate of the AIC or its predecessor the AIBLAC. 11.4.  Collection  of  Evidence.  An abbreviated accident investigation should proceed along the same lines as a full scale accident investigation.  See Chapter 5 for conducting the investigation.  Physical evidence may be viewed and tested, witnesses interviewed, and SMEs used to analyze the  facts  and  data  available.    However,  the  documentation  required,  the  number  of  witnesses interviewed,  and  depth  of  technical  analyses  may  vary,  depending  on  the  circumstances.    The abbreviated  accident  investigation  should  not  sacrifice  the  quality  of  a  comprehensive investigation because of its abbreviated nature. 11.5.  Writing and Assembling the Abbreviated Report.   86  AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015 11.5.1.  All reports must have an Executive Summary, Summary of Facts, and Statement of Opinion (for AIBs, and for GAIBs, if a Statement of Opinion is authorized).  However, the content and amount of supporting documentation and other evidence may vary. 11.5.2.  Tabs. 11.5.2.1.  When the SIB, or the single investigator, has produced a formal report: 11.5.2.1.1.  The  accident  investigation  shall  incorporate  the  SIB  Part  1  as  Tabs  A through S of the report.  The remaining Tabs T to BB may be added if necessary.  If any of the Tabs T to BB are not used, indicate “Tab Not Used” where appropriate. 11.5.2.2.  When  the  SIB,  or  single  investigator,  has  not  produced  a  formal  report,  tabs may  be  used,  as  necessary  to  incorporate  non-privileged  information  received  from  the safety investigation. 11.5.3.  The  cover  page  and  “Authority”  paragraph  of  the  Summary  of  Facts  must  state:  “This  investigation  is  an  Abbreviated  [Ground]  Accident  Investigation,  conducted  pursuant to Chapter 11 of AFI 51-503.” 11.6.  Disposition of Wreckage. 11.6.1.  The CA’s SJA may release wreckage from legal hold once the abbreviated report has been approved. 11.6.2.  The CA’s SJA shall notify AFLOA/JACC in writing when releasing wreckage from legal hold. 11.6.3.  Only  the  CA  or  designee  may  approve  the  aircraft’s  or  asset’s  repair  and  return  to operational service prior to approval of the abbreviated report. 11.6.4.  A release from legal hold is not a disposal authorization.  Those in possession of the wreckage  must  further  comply  with  applicable  instructions.    Consult  with  the  appropriate logistics  directorate  for  further  information.    If  there  is  NWRM  in  the  wreckage,  ensure compliance  with  AFI  20-110  by  returning  any  NWRM  to  the  local  NWRMAO  for  proper disposition. AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015   87  Chapter 12 INVESTIGATING SPACE MISHAPS 12.1.  General Policy. 12.1.1.  An accident investigation shall not be convened pursuant to this publication for space anomalies or other occurrences that do not meet the definition of “accident” in this publication (e.g., no damage occurred, mission was successful, etc.). 12.1.2.  The  unique  nature  of  the  space  industry  forms  the  basis  for  Air  Force  policy authorizing  the  release  of  relevant  space  mishap  evidence  and  equipment  to  commercial space users with a direct interest in the information, and to other federal space agencies, prior to  the  completion  of  the  SIB  and  AIB  processes,  if  such  release  will  not  hamper  either process.    The  releases  allow  space  launch  contractors  to  make  necessary  changes  and continue  with  scheduled  launches,  thus  enabling  rapid  reuse  of  launch  platforms  and equipment.    The  commercial  users  are  instructed  to  maintain  the  confidentiality  of  the information  provided  to  them  and  to  refrain  from  releasing  it  without  specific  Air  Force authorization. 12.1.3.  Space accident investigations generally take considerably more time to complete due to  the  complex  technical  data  that  must  be  downloaded  and  analyzed,  as  well  as,  the classified and sensitive nature of the payloads and space launch vehicles. 12.1.3.1.  Due  to  the  classified  nature  of  space  assets,  coordinate  early  with  AFSPC/JA and  AFLOA/JACC  to  obtain  a  waiver  of  the  public  release  requirement  and  produce  a classified addendum, if needed. 12.1.3.2.  Proprietary  information,  ITAR  information,  or  other  sensitive  information  not otherwise  classified,  do  not  qualify  for  a  separate  addendum  (e.g.,  proprietary addendum). 12.1.4.  Space  SIB  and  accident  investigations  may  be  conducted  simultaneously  and  rely heavily on the receipt of the technical analyses conducted by the Engineering Analysis Group (EAG), discussed in paragraph 12.2 below, in arriving at their findings and conclusions. 12.1.5.  There are many unique aspects of a space accident investigation, including: 12.1.5.1.  Often, there is no mishap site; the only tie to the ground will be the launch or operations center. 12.1.5.2.  With  on-orbit  mishaps,  there  is  usually  no  physical  evidence,  just  telemetry data that can only be deciphered by those who built the craft. 12.1.5.3.  Space  systems  often  do  not  have  DoD  maintenance  personnel;  contractors provide support for launch and on-orbit operations. 12.1.5.4.  Most  military  satellites  are  bought  in  limited  quantities;  after  the  last  is launched, contractor support quickly dwindles as those who built the craft and have the most knowledge of it have moved on to other projects. 12.1.5.5.  Many space mishaps, particularly on-orbit, are classified.   88  AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015 12.2.  The  Engineering  Analysis  Group.  The  contractor  and  the  system  program  office,  in coordination with the SIB and AIB presidents, may establish an EAG to assist in analyzing the technical data from a mishap. 12.2.1.  The  group  is  composed  of  contractor  personnel  (who  must  sign  confidentiality agreements), Air Force representatives, and other experts, as necessary.  See Attachment 2. 12.2.2.  The EAG is not required to identify causes or to make recommendations, but may do so. 12.2.3.  The EAG works with, but independently of, both the SIB and AIB.  The EAG is not subject to the direction or supervision of either board. 12.2.3.1.  The  SIB  and  space  accident  investigation  may  ask  questions  of  the  EAG; however, the EAG may not discuss SIB comments with the accident investigation. 12.2.4.  The EAG may recommend to the SIB president and the space accident investigation president  that certain non-privileged evidence and equipment be released in order that space launches may continue. 12.2.4.1.  The  space  accident  investigation  president,  with  the  concurrence  of  the  SIB president,  shall  release  any  such  evidence  or  equipment  unless  doing  so  will  hinder  the SIB and space accident investigation processes. 12.2.5.  Under no circumstances will the EAG take any action that will hinder the work of the SIB  or  space  accident  investigation.    If  at  any  time,  the  work  of  the  EAG  is  thought  to  be hindering  the  ability  of  the  space  accident  investigation  to  meet  its  objectives,  the  space accident investigation president shall notify AFSPC/JA immediately. 12.2.6.  The AIB is not required to adopt any findings or conclusions of the EAG. 12.3.  Guidance  for  Space  Mishaps.  The  AIB  shall  contact  AFSPC/JA  for  specific  guidance regarding the investigation of space mishaps. 12.4.  Assembling the Space AIB Report. 12.4.1.  Assemble the AIB report in the same manner as other AIB reports, IAW Chapter 8. 12.4.2.  Incorporate space-unique evidence in tabs not otherwise designated in Chapter 8. AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015   89  Chapter 13 GROUND ACCIDENT INVESTIGATIONS 13.1.  Ground Accident Investigation Board Composition. 13.1.1.  At a minimum, a GAIB must include a board president, legal advisor, and recorder. 13.1.2.  Other  board  members  and  SMEs  may  be  appointed  as  circumstances  require, depending upon the type and complexity of the mishap.  They may include individuals with extensive  knowledge,  training,  and/or  experience  in  specialty  areas  related  to  the  mishap, including: 13.1.2.1.

Damage  or  injury  includes:  damage  to  DoD  property; occupational illness to DoD military or civilian personnel; injury to DoD military personnel on- or off-duty;  injury to  on-duty DoD  civilian personnel; damage to  public or private property;  or injury  or  illness  to  non-DoD  personnel  caused  by  Air  Force  activities.    Unless  otherwise indicated,  the  term  “accident”  is  used  interchangeably  with  the  term  “mishap”  throughout  this publication. Accident  Investigation—  An  investigation  of  an  aerospace  or  ground  mishap  constituting  an accident  as  defined  above,  conducted  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  AFI  51-503.    Aerospace accident  investigations  arise  from  mishaps  involving  aircraft  or  flying  operations.    Ground accident investigations arise from mishaps occurring on land or while afloat. Adverse  Information—  Information  that  constitutes:    (1)  a  violation  of  criminal  law;  the UCMJ; DoD 5500.7-R, Joint Ethics Regulation (JER); the Anti-Deficiency Act; DoD Directives and Instructions; Air Force Instructions; or military or civilian personnel policies; (2) an abuse of authority,  especially  when  an  element  of  personal  benefit  accrues  to  the  official,  a  family member, or an associate; (3) fraud, waste, and abuse or mismanagement,  governed by AFI 90-301  or  involving  non-appropriated  funds  or  morale,  welfare,  and  recreation  assets,  including personnel and facilities, as governed by AFI 34-225, Air Force Services Nonappropriated Fund Governance  and  AFI  34-202,  Protecting  Non-appropriated  Funds  Assets;  (4)  misconduct  by  a medical provider requiring actions to suspend, limit, or revoke clinical privileges, as governed by AFI 44-119, Medical Quality Operations; (5) prohibited discrimination or sexual harassment as described  by  AFI  36-2706,  Equal  Opportunity  Program,  Military  and  Civilian;  or  (6)  a  matter not  included  above  which  may  reflect  adversely  on  the  individual’s  judgment  or  exercise  of authority. Adverse Administrative Action— Any proceeding or action taken that adversely affects or has a  potential  to  adversely  affect  an  individual’s  current  position  or  career.    Such  actions  include, but  are  not  limited  to,  discharge,  demotion,  bar  to  reenlistment,  court-martial,  nonjudicial punishment, Letter of Reprimand, or adverse performance evaluation. Cause— An act, omission, condition, or circumstance that starts, sustains, or creates a condition permitting the mishap, without which the mishap could not have occurred.  It may be an element of  human,  environmental,  mechanical  performance  or  a  combination  thereof.    A  given  act, omission, condition, or circumstance is a “cause” if correcting, eliminating, or avoiding it would have prevented the mishap. Colonel  (or Civilian Equivalent)— For purposes of this publication, any Air Force, Air Force Reserve, or ANG officer in the grade of O-6; officer who has been selected for promotion to the grade of O-6 but has not yet assumed that grade; or Air Force civil service employee in the grade of GS-15. Convening  Authority—  The  individual  responsible  for  convening  and  approving  the  legal (accident)  investigation  of  an  on-duty  accident  involving  Air  Force  aircraft,  RPAs  (including unmanned aerial vehicles and aerostat balloons), missiles, space systems or equipment, and other Air  Force  assets  or  personnel.    The  convening  authority  initiates  the  accident  investigation  by AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015   101  convening a board and closes the investigation by approving or disapproving the report prepared about the investigation. Destroyed  Aircraft,  RPA,  Missile,  Space  Launch  System,  or  Space  Asset—  A  damaged aircraft/RPA not repaired is not automatically a “destroyed” aircraft/RPA.  The decision whether or not to return a damaged aircraft/RPA to service is independent of the mishap class.  When the aircraft/RPA  will  not  be  returned  to  service,  classify  the  mishap  damage  according  to  the  total estimated  repair  cost  as  if  it  had  been  returned  to  service.    Detailed  procedures  for  obtaining disposition recommendations from the program manager can be found in AFI 16-402, Aerospace Vehicle Programming, Assignment, Distribution, Accounting, and Termination. Direct  Cost— Direct mishap costs ONLY include property damage costs (DoD and non-DoD) and  environmental  cleanup  costs.    According  to  DoDI  6055.07,  calculate  the  direct  cost  of  an accident  by  adding  all  costs  of  damaged  or  destroyed  assets,  including  resultant  costs  such  as environmental  decontamination  and  restoration,  property  clean-up  and  restitution.    The  direct cost of damage to DoD or non-DoD property will be computed using the actual cost of repair or replacement (including work hours for repair), or the best official estimate available.  The cost of a  destroyed  aircraft  will include  the  original  fly-away  cost  plus  the  cost  of  all  modifications  in then-year dollars.  Do not include the costs of any further DoD property damage resulting from rescue or salvage. The cost of intentionally jettisoned items will not be included in the cost of the mishap. Department  of  Defense  Civilian  Personnel— A Federal civilian employee of the Department of  Defense  directly  hired  and  paid  from  appropriated  or  non-appropriated  funds,  under permanent  or  temporary  appointment.    This  includes  Reserve  Component  military  technicians (unless in a military duty status), and non-dual status technicians; U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Civil Works employees; Youth or Student Assistance Program employees; and foreign nationals employed by the DoD Components. Department  of  Defense  Components—  The  Office  of  the  Secretary  of  Defense,  the  Military Departments,  the  Chairman  of  the  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff  and  the  Joint  Staff,  the  combatant commands, the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Defense, the Department of Defense agencies, Department of Defense field activities, and all other organizational entities in the Department of Defense. Department of Defense Military Personnel— All U.S. military personnel, including members of  the  Army,  Navy,  Air  Force,  and  Marine  Corps  Reserves,  the  Army  National  Guard  of  the United States, and the Air National Guard of the United States, on active duty or inactive duty for training under the provisions of Title 10 U.S.C. or Title 32 U.S.C.; cadets of the United States Military Academy and the United States Air Force Academy; midshipmen of the United States Naval  Academy;  Reserve  Officer  Training  Corps  cadets  when  engaged  in  directed  training activities; and foreign national military personnel assigned to the DoD Components. Engineering  Analysis  Group  (EAG)—  An  independent  group  of  contractor  personnel,  Air Force  representatives,  and  other  experts  established  to  assist  the  SIB  and  space  accident investigation in analyzing the technical data from a space mishap investigation.  The EAG may recommend  to  the  SIB  president  and  space  accident  investigation  president  that  certain  non-privileged evidence and equipment be released while the investigations are pending in order that space launches may continue.   102  AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015 Evidence— Information or data upon which a conclusion or judgment may be based.  Evidence is  information  that  tends  to  prove  or  disprove  the  existence  of  a  fact.    Evidence  can  include documents,  witness  testimony  or  statements,  drawings,  photographs,  videotapes  or  other recorded  information,  wreckage,  physical  objects,  test  reports  and  analysis.    Evidence  includes direct and circumstantial evidence Executive Summary— A one-page statement of the basic facts surrounding the accident being investigated.    For  AIBs,  and  GAIBs  if  authorized,  it  also  presents  the  AIB  president’s  opinion regarding  the  cause(s)  and/or  factor(s)  that  substantially  contributed  to  the  mishap.    The Executive Summary is a stand-alone document often used in press releases.  It must be complete and make sense without reference to any other document. Factual Data Animation— An aircraft accident animation based on non-privileged factual data (also known as a raw cut animation).  AFSEC technicians sometimes prepare an animation of the mishap  for  the  SIB.    As  the  raw  cut  of  that  animation  does  not  contain  any  privileged  safety information, the accident investigation may use it as part of its investigation. Fatal  Injury—  Injury  resulting  in  death,  either  during  the  mishap  or  at  a  later  time,  including within 30 days subsequent to a medical discharge, retirement or separation from military service, if the action arises from mishap injuries. Foreign  Country—  Any  land,  water,  or  airspace  that  is  subject  to  competent  exercise  of jurisdiction  by  one  or  more  foreign  governments  or  international  organizations;  a  nation, territory, or geographic area that is outside the United States. Friendly  Fire—  A  circumstance  in  which  authorized  members  of  U.S.  or  friendly  military forces, U.S.  or friendly  official  government  employees, U.S.  DoD or friendly nation contractor personnel,  and  nongovernmental  organizations  or  private  volunteer  organizations,  who,  while accompanying or operating with the U.S. Armed Forces, are mistakenly or accidentally killed or wounded  in  action  by  U.S.  or  friendly  forces  actively  engaged  with  an  enemy  or  who  are directing  fire  at  a  hostile  force  or  what  is  thought  to  be  a  hostile  force.  This  also  includes incidents that result in only damage or destruction of U.S. or friendly nation’s military property mistakenly or accidentally damaged in action by U.S. or friendly forces actively engaged with an enemy, or who are directing fire at a hostile force or what is thought to be a hostile force. Full  Scale  Aerial  Target  Remotely  Piloted  Vehicle  (FSAT  RPV)—  An  RPV  that  is  or  was formerly  capable  of  carrying  a  person.    It  is  usually  an  aircraft  that  has  been  modified  to  a remotely  piloted  configuration.    Normally  used  as  a  target,  decoy,  sensor  platform,  or  test  bed (e.g., QF-4, QF-16, etc.).  When an FSAT is carrying a person, it is considered an aircraft under this publication. Host  Installation—  The  Air  Force  installation  nearest  to  the  accident,  unless  host  installation responsibilities  are  assigned  to  an  alternate  installation  or  an  Air  Reserve  Component installation.    The  host  installation  initially  responds  to  the  mishap  and  provides  administrative and  logistical  support  to  ensuing  safety  and  accident  investigations.    The  host  installation  or designee  also  provides  storage  and  security  for  evidence  and  wreckage,  as  directed.    Upon release  from  legal  hold,  the  host  installation  disposes  of  the  wreckage.    The  host  installation normally  has  responsibility  for  initial  clean-up  of  the  accident  site  and  any  required  follow-on environmental  remediation  or  restoration.    For  joint  bases  where  the  Air  Force  is  not  the  host service  or  in  control  of  the  installation,  the  Air  Force  active  duty  wing  (or  group  if  there  if  no AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015   103  active  duty  wing)  takes  on  the  responsibilities  of  “host  installation”  to  the  extent  practicable, under the guidance of the CA, and subject to any interservice support agreements.  If there is no active duty/component Air Force organization of the joint installation, the AFRC wing (if any) or ANG wing (if there is no AFRC wing) takes on the responsibilities of “host installation” to the extent  practicable,  under  the  guidance  of  the  CA,  and  subject  to  any  interservice  support agreements. Incident  Commander—  A  trained  and  experienced  responder  who  provides  on-scene  control using subject matter experts (SME) and support from other functional areas.  Normally, incident commanders  are  SMEs  from  the  Fire,  Medical,  or  Security  Forces  response  elements.    The incident  commander  uses  the  Air  Force  Incident  Management  System  (AFIMS)  to  manage  the incident.    AFIMS  is  a  methodology  designed  to  incorporate  the  requirements  of  Homeland Security Presidential Directive  - 5, the National  Incident Management System (NIMS), and the National  Response  Plan  (NRP).    AFIMS  has  replaced  the  term  “on  scene  commander”  with “incident commander” to be consistent with NIMS and NRP terminology.  See AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning and Operations. Installation—  A  base,  camp,  post,  station,  yard,  center,  or  other  DoD  activity  under  the jurisdiction of the Secretary of one of the DoD’s military departments.  An installation might be located in the United States or in a territory, commonwealth, or possession of the United States.  An installation might also be located in an area outside the United States.  An installation may be a grouping of facilities, located in the same vicinity, which support particular functions. International  Agreement—  A  multilateral  or  bilateral  agreement,  such  as  a  base  rights  or access  agreement,  a  status  of  forces  agreement,  including  practices  and  standards  established pursuant to such agreement, or any other instrument defined as a binding international agreement under DoD Directive 5530.3, International Agreements. Joint Service Accident— A single mishap involving two or more military services of the DoD in which one or more services experiences reportable injuries or damages. Legal Investigation— An investigation of a DoD accident conducted for any purpose other than mishap prevention.  A legal investigation inquires into the facts and circumstances surrounding an  accident,  but  does  not  focus  on  mishap  prevention.    A  legal  investigation  obtains  and preserves evidence for use in  litigation, adjudication of tort claims, disciplinary action, adverse administrative action, and all other purposes except mishap prevention.  A legal investigation can include an accident investigation, CDI, or any other formal investigative process. Major  Command  (MAJCOM)—  The  primary  subdivisions  that  are  directly  subordinate  to Headquarters United States Air Force. Major  Command  Commander—  Commander  of  an  Air  Force  Major  Command.    The  Air Force Major Commands are Air Combat Command, Air Education and Training Command, Air Force Global Strike Command, Air Force Materiel Command, Air Force Reserve Command, Air Force  Space  Command,  Air  Force  Special  Operations  Command,  Air  Mobility  Command, Pacific Air Forces, and United States Air Forces in Europe - Air Forces Africa.  In addition, for purposes  of  this  publication,  this  term  includes  the  air  component  commander  of  a  Unified Combatant Command during contingency or combat operations. Mishap— See definition of “accident.”   104  AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015 Mishap Costs— See definition of “direct costs.” Missile  Mishap—  Mishaps  involving  missiles  that  are  propelled  through  air  or  water  that  are unmanned,  guided  by  internal  or  external  systems,  self-propelled,  and  designed  to  deliver ordnance to a target or act as a target.  This term includes missile support equipment. Next—of-Kin (NoK) - The person(s) most closely related to another person.  Normally, the NoK for  a  married  person  is  the  decedent’s  widow  or  widower.    For  single  individuals  without children, the NoK normally is the surviving parents or, if none, surviving siblings.  The CA and board president should not  use this definition as  a firm  limitation  on who may attend the  NoK briefing.  Sensitivities to family relations and circumstances should dictate how many people and who may attend the NoK briefing, or if separate briefings are more appropriate. On—Duty - DoD personnel are on-duty when:  (1) physically present at any location where they are  to  perform  their  officially  assigned  work  (officially  assigned  work  includes  organization-sponsored events an employee is  permitted to attend, regardless of location, and includes those activities  incident  to  normal  work  activities  that  occur  on  DoD  installations,  such  as  lunch, coffee, or rest breaks, and all activities aboard military vessels); (2) being transported by DoD or commercial  conveyance  to  perform  officially  assigned  work  (includes  travel  in  private  motor vehicles or commercial conveyances while performing official duty but does not include routine travel to and from work or employee travel during a permanent change of station move); and (3) on TDY or additional duty (TDY personnel are on-duty 24-hours a day for any injury that results from activities essential or incidental to the TDY assignment; however, when personnel deviate from  the  normal  incidents  of  the  trip  and  become  involved  in  activities,  personal  or  otherwise, that  are  not  reasonably  incidental  to  the  duties  of  the  TDY  assignment  contemplated  by  the employer,  the  person  ceases  to  be  considered  on-duty  for  purposes  of  this  publication).    See DoDI  6055.07,  Mishap  Notification,  Investigation,  Reporting,  and  Record  Keeping,  for additional information. Off-Duty—  DoD  personnel  are  off-duty  when  they  are  not  on-duty.    Reserve  Component personnel  performing  inactive  duty  training  (IDT)  (e.g.,  drill,  Additional  Flight  Training Program flights) shall be considered off-duty:  When traveling to or from the place at which such duty  is  performed;  or  While  remaining  overnight,  immediately  before  the  commencement  of IDT;  or  While  remaining  overnight  between  successive  periods  of  IDT,  at  or  in  the  vicinity  of the  site  of  the  IDT,  unless  the  site  of  the  IDT  is  outside  reasonable  commuting  distance  of  the member's residence.” Overseas—  A  nation,  territory,  or  geographic  area  that  is  outside  the  United  States;  a  foreign country or territory. Personally Identifying/Identifiable Information— According to 10 U.S.C. § 130b, “personally identifying  information,”  with  respect  to  any  person,  means  the  person’s  name,  rank,  duty address,  and  official  title  and  information  regarding  the  person’s  pay.    According  to  DoD 5400.11-R,  DoD  Privacy  Program,  “personally  identifiable  information”  means  information which can be used to distinguish or trace an individual’s identity, such as their name, SSN, date and  place  of  birth,  mother’s  maiden  name,  biometric  records,  including  any  other  personal information which is linked or linkable to a specified individual. Preponderance of Evidence— The greater weight of credible evidence.  Evidence, which, as a whole,  shows  that  the  fact  sought  to  be  proved  is  more  probable  than  not.    In  other  words,  a AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015   105  preponderance of the evidence means such evidence as, when considered and compared with the evidence opposed to it, has more convincing force, and produces in your mind’s belief that what is sought to be proved is more likely true than not true. Privileged  Safety  Information—  Privileged  safety  information  refers  to  information  that  is exempt by case law from disclosure outside the Air Force safety community.  The military safety privilege  is  judicially  recognized  and  protects  the  military  investigative  process.    Safety privileged information shall only be used for mishap prevention.  The Air Force treats privileged safety  information  as  confidential  information  to  ensure  commanders  quickly  obtain  accurate mishap  information  thereby  promoting  safety,  combat  readiness,  and  mission  accomplishment.

Animations made  exclusively  from  recorder  data  (including  Military  Flight  Operations  Quality  Assurance data)  are  not  privileged;  (5)  Photographs,  imagery,  and  animations  that  reveal  the  deliberative process of the board, including photographs with markings; and (6) IAW AFI 91-204 the SIB’s life sciences material, particularly 14-day and 72-hour histories, are only privileged if privilege was granted by a safety or life sciences investigator.  However, if histories are not labeled either “privileged” or “non-privileged,” then the legal  advisor shall confirm with the SIB whether the histories are “non-privileged” before allowing other board members and SMEs access. Recorder—  A  DoD  military  member  familiar  with  administrative  procedures  associated  with accident  investigations.    A  recorder  should  be  detailed  to  the  accident  investigation  to  provide administrative  assistance  as  directed  by  the  board  president.    A  paralegal  should  serve  as recorder. Remotely  Piloted  Aircraft  (RPA)—  A  powered  aerial  vehicle  that  does  not  carry  a  human operator,  uses  aerodynamic  forces  (including  buoyancy  or  dynamic  action)  to  provide  vehicle lift,  can  fly  autonomously  or  be  piloted  remotely,  can  be  expendable  or  recoverable,  and  can carry  a  lethal  or  nonlethal  payload.    This  includes  aerostat  balloons.    Ballistic  or  semi-ballistic vehicles, cruise missiles, and artillery projectiles  are not  considered RPAs.  RPAs are operated and exclusively controlled by a DoD Component, or furnished by the Government or in bailment to  a  non-DoD  organization  for  modification,  maintenance,  repair,  test,  contract  training,  or experimental  project  for  a  DoD  Component,  when  the  Government  has  assumed  ground  and flight risk. Remotely  Piloted  Vehicle  (RPV)—  An  unmanned  vehicle  capable  of  being  controlled  from  a distant  location  through  a  communication  link.    It  is  normally  designed  to  be  recoverable.    An RPV may be used as a target, attack reconnaissance, electronic counter measure (ECM), or test bed-carrying  vehicle.    It  may  be  an  aircraft  specifically  designed  as  an  RPV  or  a  formerly manned aircraft modified to the remotely piloted configuration.  For purposes of this publication, all RPVs are aerospace vehicles. Safety  Investigation— An  investigation  of  a  DoD  accident  conducted  solely  to  prevent  future mishaps.  A safety investigation tries to determine why a mishap occurred and identifies actions   106  AFI51-503  14 APRIL 2015 that  can  be  taken  to  prevent  similar  accidents  from  happening  in  the  future.    AFI  91-204 prescribes when and how to conduct an Air Force safety investigation. Senior  Official—  A  Senior  Official  is  defined  as  any  active  or  retired  Regular  Air  Force,  Air Force  Reserve,  or  Air  National  Guard  military  officer  in  the  grade  of  O-7  (brigadier  general) select  and  above,  and  Air  National  Guard  Colonels  with  a  Certificate  of  Eligibility  (COE). Current or former members of the Senior Executive Service (SES) or equivalent and current and former  Air  Force  civilian  Presidential  appointees  are  also  considered  senior  officials.  (NOTE: under DOD policy, an officer becomes an O-7 select, and therefore a senior official, at the time the selection board that selects the officer adjourns.) Serious  Injury—  An  injury  or  occupational  illness  that,  in  the  opinion  of  competent  medical authority, results in permanent total disability or permanent partial disability. Site— Any single parcel of land, regardless of size, used and maintained by a DoD Component.  A mishap site is any location where a mishap occurs, regardless of land ownership or use. Space Mishap— A mishap involving space systems or unique space support equipment.  Space anomalies or other occurrences (e.g., no damage occurred, mission was successful, etc.) that do not meet the definition of “accident” in this publication are not space mishaps. Statement  of  Opinion—  A  written  narrative  of  the  AIB  president’s  opinion  on  the  cause(s) and/or  substantially  contributing  factor(s)  of  the  accident  being  investigated.    If  authorized  by AFLOA/JACC,  a  GAIB  president  may  also  write  a  statement  of  opinion.    The  Statement  of Opinion is a stand-alone document and does not address matters outside the scope of the accident investigation.  A Statement of Opinion is prepared and included in the AIB report. Status  of  Forces  Agreement—  A  bilateral  or  multilateral  agreement  that  defines  the  legal position of a visiting military force deployed in the territory of a friendly state. Subject  Matter  Expert  (SME)—  An  expert  whose  involvement  with  the  board  is  limited  to his/her area of expertise.  A SME must have sufficient knowledge, skill, or training in a specific matter  to  be  considered  an  expert  in  that  subject  area.    Typically,  SMEs  do  not  participate  in board deliberations or witness interviews, but may provide input on witness interview questions to ask.  SMEs shall not be appointed on the convening order. Substantially  Contributing  Factor—  An  act,  omission,  condition,  or  circumstance  that  is shown by a preponderance of evidence to have played an important role, directly or indirectly, in the mishap, but its correction, elimination, or avoidance would not, by itself, have prevented the mishap. Summary  of  Facts—  A  written  narrative  of  the  relevant  facts  regarding  the  accident  being investigated.  It does not include conclusions or opinions about the cause(s) and/or factor(s) that substantially contributed to the accident.  The Summary of Facts should be written in a manner that the general public can comprehend and must explain all technical terms.  All statements of facts must be cited to a tab in the report. Tabs— Portion of the AIB/GAIB report containing the documents and other evidence referenced in the Summary of Facts.
