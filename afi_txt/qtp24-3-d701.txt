Overview safety and precautions.  The following are safety items and procedures to be followed during concrete transit mixer operations.  The manufacturer’s operator’s manual will also provide safe operating procedures and the vehicle itself may have warnings, cautions and danger stickers that the vehicle operator should be aware of.  5.4.2.  Vehicle data plate.  Be familiar with the location and information found on the data plate.  5.4.3.  Over the road operation.  5.4.3.1.  Greater vehicle weight.  The operator needs to consider the combined weight of the concrete transit mixer and the load.  This will affect the following:  5.4.3.1.1.    Operator’s ability to stop.  Do not tailgate the vehicle in front.  Allow more distance between vehicles in order to increase reaction time.  5.4.3.1.2.    Vehicle’s  ability  to  accelerate/follow  the  flow  of  traffic.    Accelerate smoothly  and  gradually  so  the  truck  does  not  jerk.    Rough  acceleration  causes unnecessary, premature mechanical damage to the mixer’s drive train.  Maintain a safe speed (typically 5 miles per hour (mph) below the posted speed limit).  5.4.3.2.  Downgrades/upgrades.    The  operator  will  use  lower  gears  more  frequently  to climb hills or mountains with increasing grade steepness, length and/or heavy load weight.  Plan ahead to identify downgrades/upgrades on the route of travel.  If possible, talk to other drivers  who  are  familiar  with  the  grades  to  find  out  what  speeds  are  safe.    When encountering downgrades/upgrades as described, the operator will need to address:  5.4.3.2.1.    Speed.  On downgrades, gravity causes the speed of the vehicle to increase.  The operator must select an appropriate safe speed, use a low gear, and proper braking techniques.  The operator must go slow enough so as to not overheat the brakes.  5.4.3.2.2.    Stopping.  If the brakes become too hot, they may start to “fade”.  This means the operator will need to apply the brakes harder and harder to acquire equivalent stopping power.    5.4.3.3.  Sharp turns.  Slow down before entering the turn.  During the turn, avoid sharp sudden movements with the steering wheel.  This reduces the chance of shifting the load in the tank, and also prevents the possibility of tipping over due to the higher center of gravity.  5.4.3.4.  Surroundings.  Operating an dump truck requires the operator’s constant attention.  Many  situations  can  be  avoided  by  simply  paying  close  attention  to  the  surrounding conditions.    Road  signs  such  as  “steep  grade”,  “low  overhead  clearance”,  “sharp  turn ahead”, and special speed limits are posted for the driver’s safety.  5.4.4.1.  Use a spotter and hand signals.  5.4.4.2.  Back slowly and keep the spotter in view at all times.  If the operator loses sight of the spotter, the operator must immediately stop the vehicle.  5.4.4.3.  See AFMAN 24-306 for standard AF spotter hand signals and additional guidance on spotter safety.  5.4.4.  Backing.  5.4.5.1.    Apply the parking brake.  Chock the wheels. 5.4.5.  Parking.   5.4.6.  Tire Changing Safety.        5.4.6.1.  Consider  where  the  vehicle  is  located.    If  on  a  bridge,  curve,  road  with  no shoulder, etc.; it is safer to move a vehicle on a flat tire to a safe location. 5.4.6.2.  Find a location with a firm and level surface for the jack. 5.4.6.3.  Turn on the four-way flashers. 5.4.6.4.  Place warning triangles or flares. 5.4.6.5.  Chock the wheels.  If changing a front tire, block the rear wheels.  If changing a rear tire, chock the front wheels. 5.4.6.6.  Place the vehicle in “Park” if it has an automatic transmission and low gear if it has a standard shift.  5.4.6.7.  Ensure the jack is rated for the weight of the vehicle.  Ensure proper placement of jack. 5.4.6.8.  If available, use jack stands after lifting the vehicle.  Once the vehicle is lifted; never at any time get under the vehicle. 5.4.6.9.  Before removing lug nuts, ensure lug wedges are loose (double check). 5.4.6.10.   After  changing  the  tire,  return  the  jack  and  lug  wrench  to  the  location recommended by the manufacturer (keep them from becoming flying projectiles and makes them available for future tire changes). 5.4.6.11.   Secure the damaged tire and once it is repaired, return the spare tire back to its proper location.  5.4.7.  Off-road driving.  For more information on off-road driving and safe vehicle operation guidance, refer to AFMAN 24-306.  5.5. Vehicle Operation.  5.5.1.  General vehicle operation.       5.5.1.1.  Fill water tanks with water.  5.5.1.2.  Back the transit mixer to the appropriate area for loading.  Use a spotter when backing; align the discharge chute directly above the transit hopper. 5.5.1.3.  Throttle should be left at idle and drum in the charging position.   5.5.1.4.  When charging is complete, reset rotation counter, make sure the hopper is clean, and wet down before discharging, then clean the drum when empty.  5.5.1.5.  Concrete must be delivered and discharged within one hour or before the drum has revolved 300 turns.  If not discharged in the appropriate time, it may result in concrete strength loss, temperature increase, excessive loss of entrained air, and accelerated slump loss.  5.5.1.6.  Operator will not add water to the mix while transporting the concrete.  5.5.1.7.  During cold weather operations drain all tanks (both air and water) to prevent freezing.   Section 6—EXPLANATION AND DEMONSTRATION.  6.1. Instructor’s Preparation.  6.1.1.

Test for hydraulic leaks. If the vehicle has hydraulic brakes, pump the brake pedal three times. Then apply firm pressure to the pedal and hold for five seconds. The pedal should not move.  If it does, there may be a leak or other problem. Brake system. Test parking brake. Fasten safety belt. Set parking brake (power unit only). Place vehicle into a low gear. Gently pull forward against parking brake to make sure the parking brake holds. If it doesn't hold vehicle, it is faulty; get it fixed. Test service brake stopping action. Go about 5 miles per hour. Push brake pedal firmly. "Pulling" to one side or the other can mean brake trouble. Any unusual brake pedal "feel" or delayed stopping action can mean trouble. If the trainee finds anything unsafe during the Vehicle inspection, get it fixed. Federal and state laws forbid operating an unsafe vehicle. Check vehicle operation regularly: Instruments. o o o o o o • o • Air pressure gauge (if the vehicle has air brakes). Temperature gauges. Pressure gauges. Ammeter/voltmeter. Mirrors. Tires.
