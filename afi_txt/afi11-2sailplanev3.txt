Scope.  This  instruction  outlines  the  procedures  applicable  to  the  safe  operation  of sailplanes,  including  the  TG-10,  TG-15,  and  any  other  sailplane  acquired  to  conduct  AF- approved  sailplane  flying  programs.  Along  with  the  complementary  references  cited,  this instruction  prescribes  standard  operational  procedures  to  be  used  by  all  pilots  operating sailplanes. Units will provide local operating procedures in a supplement to this publication. 1.2.  Pilot’s  Responsibility.  In  conjunction  with  other  governing  directives,  this  instruction prescribes sailplane procedures under most circumstances, but is not to be used as a substitute for sound judgment or common sense. The pilot in command (PIC) is ultimately responsible for the safe  and  effective  operation  of  the  aircraft  and  will  ensure  all  occupants  of  the  aircraft  comply with this directive. 1.3.  Deviations.  Do  not  deviate  from  the  procedures  and  guidance  in  this  publication  except when  necessary  to  preserve  safety  or  protect  lives.  In  that  case,  the  PIC  has  ultimate  authority and  responsibility  for  the  course  of  action  to  be  taken  and  will  take  the  appropriate  action  to safely  recover  the  aircraft.  Report  all  deviations  without  waiver  through  channels  to  the MAJCOM OPR.  (T-2). 1.4.  References.  The  primary  references  for  sailplane  operations  are  this  instruction  and technical  orders  (TO)  1G-10(T)-1,  Flight  Manual--USAF  Series,  TG-10B/C  Sailplanes,  or  TO 1G-15(T)-1, Flight Manual--USAF Series TG-15A/B Aircraft. 1.4.1.  For  sailplane  assembly  and  disassembly,  use  the  appropriate  flight  manual  or  the current version of the applicable sailplane assembly and disassembly checklist published by AETC/A3V (available at:  https://www-r.aetc.af.mil/do/dof/download.asp). 1.4.2.  Training  units  may  develop  phase  manuals  from  the  procedures  contained  in  these documents. Phase manuals may be used to augment initial and mission qualification training. They  may  expand  these  basic  procedures,  but  will  not  be  less  restrictive.    (T-2).    Only maneuvers described in these references will be flown. 1.5.  Recommended  Changes  and  Waivers.  Except  where noted herein, the MAJCOM A3 is the  waiver  authority  for  this  instruction.  Submit  waiver  requests  in  message  or  memorandum format.  (T-2). 1.6.  Crew Requirements.  The minimum crew for all sailplanes is one pilot qualified IAW AFI 11-2SAILPLANE, Volume 1, Sailplane Aircrew Training. 1.7.  Maximum Flight Duty Period Flight Time.  AFI 11-202, Volume 3, lists maximum flight duty periods. 1.7.1.  Units will consider sailplanes as “trainer” type aircraft. 1.7.2.  Use of additional crewmembers to extend the flight duty period (augmented crew) is not authorized. 1.8.  Clothing  Requirements.  All  aircrew  members  will  wear  flight  suits  and  flight  boots,  or other MAJCOM- or installation-approved uniforms while operating the aircraft. Passengers may wear any uniform combination or appropriate civilian attire. AFI11-2SAILPLANEV3  30 APRIL 2015   5  1.8.1.  Aircrew members will carry appropriate seasonal flight clothing. 1.8.2.  Aircrew members will remove rings and scarves before performing aircrew duties. 1.8.3.  Parachutes  must  be  worn  for  all  spin,  aerobatic,  cross-country,  and  planned  wave flights. 1.9.  Seatbelts  and  Shoulder  Harnesses.  All  occupants  will  wear  seatbelt  and  shoulder harnesses at all times while operating the aircraft. 1.10.  Oxygen Requirements.  The PIC will ensure oxygen is used IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 3, and  the  aircraft  flight  manual.  Units  will  ensure  only  certified  personnel  service  oxygen equipment.    (T-2).    When  oxygen  is  required,  the  minimum  oxygen  pressure  is  50  pounds  per square  inch.    Pilots  on  oxygen  will  perform  a  pressure,  regulator,  indicator,  connections,  and emergency (PRICE) check every 30 minutes. 1.11.  Cargo Restrictions.  None. 1.12.  Interfly.  Interfly  is  defined  in  AFI  11-401,  Aviation  Management.  Interfly  requires approval of both operations group commanders and notification of the appropriate numbered Air Force (NAF) and MAJCOM standardization and evaluation office.  (T-2). 1.13.  Aerial Events.  Units will conduct aerial events IAW AFI 11-209, Aerial Event Policy and Procedures, and AFI 11-246, Volume 7, Air Force Aircraft Demonstrations (Sailplanes).  (T-2).   6  AFI11-2SAILPLANEV3  30 APRIL 2015 Chapter 2 MISSION PLANNING 2.1.  Responsibilities.  The  individual  pilots  and  the  operations  functions  of  the  organizations jointly  share  responsibility  of  mission  planning.  The  PIC  is  ultimately  responsible  for  mission planning. 2.2.  General Procedures.  The pilots will: 2.2.1.  Accomplish sufficient flight planning to ensure safe mission accomplishment. AFI 11-202, Volume 3, and this instruction specify minimum requirements.  (T-2). 2.2.2.  Compute weight and balance for each flight. MAJCOM-approved tabulated data may be used when available.  (T-2). 2.2.3.  Ensure all passengers are manifested IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 3.  (T-2). 2.3.  Briefings  and  Debriefings.  The  PIC  is  responsible  for  presenting  a  logical  briefing  that will promote safe, effective mission accomplishment. All pilots will attend the flight briefing and debriefing.  (T-2).  The PIC will structure the flight briefing to accommodate the capabilities of each pilot.  (T-2).  On subsequent flights during the same day with the same crew, the PIC must brief  only  those  items  that  have  changed  from  the  previous  flights.    (T-2).    Passengers  will  be briefed on their specific responsibilities related to safe mission accomplishment.  (T-2). 2.3.1.  Briefing Guides: 2.3.1.1.  All missions will be briefed and debriefed, using the applicable briefing guide as a  reference  (Attachment  2  and  Attachment  3).    (T-2).    Note:  Briefing  guides  are reference lists of items that may apply to particular missions. 2.3.1.2.  Items  listed  may  be  briefed  in  any  sequence.  Those  items  covered  by  phase manuals or written squadron standards, and understood by all participants may be briefed as "standard." Each guide may be expanded as necessary to cover other important items of the flight. Brief only those items applicable to the particular mission and in sufficient detail to prevent any misunderstanding between crewmembers. 2.3.2.  Alternate Missions: 2.3.2.1.  Pilots will brief an alternate mission profile for each flight.  (T-2).  Solo students will not deviate from the briefed primary or alternate mission profile.  Exception: If the primary mission is a pattern tow, an alternate mission profile is not required. 2.3.2.2.  The alternate mission will be less complex than the primary mission. Missions or events not briefed will not be flown. Mission elements or events may be briefed airborne if it is practical to do so and flight safety is not compromised. 2.4.  Maps  and  Charts.  When  flying  outside  the  local  area,  appropriate  charts  covering  the route of flight must be on board the aircraft.  (T-2). 2.5.  Required Documents.  The following documents must be on board for flight (T-2): 2.5.1.  Aircraft weight and balance report. 2.5.2.  Airworthiness certificate. AFI11-2SAILPLANEV3  30 APRIL 2015   7  2.5.3.

Chapter  4  specifies  the  minimum  equipment  required  for flight. 3.1.2.  Aircraft    Systems.  Students  will  not  fly  solo  in  aircraft  requiring  an  operational check.  With  operations  supervisor  approval,  pilots  may  perform  operational  checks  during dual-student training sorties if the checks do not interfere with training objectives. 3.1.3.  Ballast Operations.  Pilots will: 3.1.3.1.  Only load ballast according to the aircraft flight manual. 3.1.3.2.  Not use parachutes for ballast unless the personnel with the parachute have been trained according to AFI 11-301, Volume 1, Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) Program. 3.1.4.  Foreign  Object  Damage  (FOD).  To  reduce  the  risk  of  FOD  and  personal  injury, personnel will ensure loose items are secured in the cockpit at all times. 3.1.5.  Assembly and Disassembly: 3.1.5.1.  Assembly  and  disassembly  of  aircraft  will  only  be  performed  by  trained crewmembers. 3.1.5.2.  After  a  sailplane  is  reassembled,  a  certified  rated  officer  or  civilian  coach  not involved  in  the  aircraft  assembly  will  sign  off  the  “Corrected  by”  block  in  the  AFTO Form  781A,  Maintenance  Discrepancy  and  Work  Document.  Qualified  maintenance personnel must then inspect the sailplane prior to flight. (Exception: When maintenance personnel  are  not  available,  an  IP  qualified  in  the  aircraft's  assembly/disassembly  may inspect the aircraft.) The individual who performed the inspection will sign off the red X and the “Inspected by” block in the AFTO Form 781A. 3.1.6.  Preflight Inspections: 3.1.6.1.  The  PIC  is  responsible  for  ensuring  the  AFTO  781-series  forms  are  reviewed prior to flight. 3.1.6.2.  Pilots  or  maintenance  personnel  discovering  a  nonairworthy  condition  will immediately  install  a  red  tag  on  the  aircraft  control  stick  and  ensure  the  aircraft  AFTO Form 781H, Aerospace Vehicle Flight Status and Maintenance, is updated to reflect a red X  status.  Units  will  make  red  tags  available  in  the  AFTO  781-series  forms.  Only authorized maintenance personnel will remove the tag when repairs are complete and the aircraft is released for flight. 3.2.  Ground Operations: 3.2.1.  Ground Handling: 3.2.1.1.  Ground  handlers  will  maintain  10  feet  of  nose-to-tail  separation  between sailplanes. (Exception: Less than 10 feet of nose-to-tail separation between sailplanes is authorized  when  sailplanes  are  staged  for  a  cross-country  launch  grid.  If  sailplanes  are AFI11-2SAILPLANEV3  30 APRIL 2015   9  staged  for  a  cross-country  launch  grid,  ground  handlers  will  remove  the  tail  wheel dollies.) 3.2.1.2.  Unless a sailplane is in the takeoff position, airbrakes will be open or unlocked and the upwind wing will be manned. 3.2.1.3.  Do not stand in front of any part of a sailplane hooked up for launch. 3.2.1.4.  Do not  ground  handle or move aircraft  so as to  overlap wings and/or fuselages unless hangaring the aircraft (paragraph 3.2.3). 3.2.1.5.  Personnel  will ensure draglines used for towing are at  least  as long as one half the wingspan of the sailplane. 3.2.1.6.  Ideally,  use  three  or  more  people  (two  minimum)  to  ground  handle  sailplanes. Normally  position  one  person  on  the  upwind  wing  tip,  and  one  person  either  at  the opposite  wing  root  or  at  the  aircraft  tail.  When  three  people  are  available,  position  the third person in the cockpit, at the other wing root, or at the aircraft tail. 3.2.1.7.  Close and secure the canopy when the cockpit is not occupied, unless the canopy is being guarded. 3.2.1.8.  Never leave a sailplane unattended unless it is secured. 3.2.1.9.  Tie down sailplanes IAW local directives and the flight manual, normally facing into the wind. When tying down any sailplane overnight, ground handlers will attach both wings and the tail to established tiedown equipment.  For the TG-15, use wing cuffs and a main wheel strap (if a main wheel  ground tiedown is available).  To prevent damage to the TG-15 fuselage, use a tail dolly or additional padding to secure the tail. 3.2.2.  High Wind Procedures.  Units will ensure there are adequate personnel on the flight line  to  safely  ground  handle  all  sailplanes  during  high  winds  (over  25  knots).  Ground handlers will increase nose to tail separation (minimum one half the wingspan) of aircraft on the flight line during high wind conditions. If practical, turn the aircraft into the wind, place a crewmember in the cockpit, and ensure the airbrakes are open to prevent aircraft damage. 3.2.2.1.  When winds exceed 25 knots, a minimum of three people are required to move each sailplane. A minimum of two people are required while the aircraft is static. 3.2.2.2.  When  winds  exceed  30  knots,  all  sailplanes  will  remain  tied  down  or  be hangared. Units will use good judgment and use as many people as possible (a minimum of  four)  to  move  sailplanes.  After  landing,  aircrews  should  remain  in  the  cockpits  with the  radio  on,  the  airbrakes  out,  and  the  stick  aft  until  assistance  arrives.  If  available, ground handlers may place weights in  front cockpits, holding the stick aft while towing the sailplane behind a vehicle. 3.2.2.3.  When  temporarily  tying  down  sailplanes  due  to  inclement  weather,  as  a minimum, ground handlers will: 3.2.2.3.1.  Attach mooring rings to established tie down equipment (TG-10). 3.2.2.3.2.  Remove the wingtips, route the tie down rope through the wingtip pin, and reconnect the wingtip to the sailplane (TG-15). 3.2.3.  Hangaring:   10  AFI11-2SAILPLANEV3  30 APRIL 2015 3.2.3.1.  Units  will  use  a  minimum  of  two  people  with  one  certified  person  to  hangar sailplanes. 3.2.3.2.  Ground handlers will install main wheel dollies by pushing the sailplane onto the dolly with the wings level and installing the stop bar. 3.2.3.3.  After hangaring, airbrakes will remain unlocked and canopies will be closed and locked (covered as necessary). 3.2.3.4.  Units may publish local sailplane hangaring procedures. 3.2.4.  Additional  Flight  Line  Duties.    Units  will  define  additional  flight  line  duties  to support sailplane operations. 3.3.  Takeoff and Landing: 3.3.1.  Minimum Runway: 3.3.1.1.  The  minimum  landing  surface  is  determined  by  the  spacing  requirements  in paragraph 3.3.4. 3.3.1.2.  Units  will  publish  procedures  to  limit  operations  when  takeoff  runways  or landing surfaces are other than dry, or when a hard surface landing is required. 3.3.1.3.  Units  will  publish  approval  procedures  for  flights  to  or  from  other  than established landing surfaces. 3.3.2.  Minimum Aerotow Rate of Climb.  Units will publish procedures to limit operations when  density  altitude  exceeds  10,000  feet.  All  tow  operations  will  cease  when  a  minimum altitude of 200 feet above ground level (AGL) cannot be achieved by 1 nautical mile (NM) from the departure end of the runway. 3.3.3.  Wind Limitations: 3.3.3.1.  Pilots  will  use  the  full  gust  factor  and  maximum  crosswind  angle  of  variable winds  to  determine  if  winds  exceed  aircraft  or  pilot  limits  for  takeoff.  If  the  crosswind component (including  gusts) exceeds flight  manual  limits,  pilots  will consider changing the landing direction and land into the wind, if possible. 3.3.3.2.  The maximum  crosswind  limit  for takeoff and landing are defined in  the  flight manual. 3.3.3.3.  The  maximum  crosswind  limit  for  an  initial  solo’s  takeoff  and  landing  is  10 knots. 3.3.4.  Minimum Spacing.  Pilots will: 3.3.4.1.  Comply  with  the  sailplane  reduced  same  runway  minimums  defined  in MAJCOM  supplements  to  AFI  13-204,  Volume  3,  Airfield  Operations  Procedures  and Programs. 3.3.4.2.  Land the aircraft so as to maintain at least one full wingspan of lateral separation from sailplanes or obstacles during landing and rollout. 3.3.4.3.  Stop  the  aircraft  no  less  than  200  feet  behind  other  aircraft,  obstacle,  or personnel.  Note:  A tow rope is not considered an obstacle, but pilots will avoid rolling over the assembly hardware. AFI11-2SAILPLANEV3  30 APRIL 2015   11  3.3.4.4.  For landings on the same runway behind other than sailplanes, not plan to cross the runway threshold until preceding aircraft are clear of the runway. 3.3.5.  Sailplane Launch: 3.3.5.1.  The  only  authorized  method  of  sailplane  launch  is  by  a  tow  rope  attached  to  a tow airplane (aerotow). 3.3.5.2.  Units  will  determine  the  minimum  tow  rope  length.  Prior  to  tow  rope  hookup, the pilot will inspect the rope condition and replace if necessary. 3.3.5.3.  Unless local requirements are different, pilots will use visual signals to: 3.3.5.3.1.  Indicate  to  the  tow  to  take  the  slack  out  of  the  tow  rope  by  leveling  the wings. 3.3.5.3.2.  Indicate to the tow when ready for takeoff by wagging the rudder. The tow should respond with a rudder wag and commence the takeoff. 3.4.  Traffic Patterns: 3.4.1.  The maximum traffic pattern bank angle is 45 degrees. 3.4.2.  The minimum safety altitude for a gate finish is 500 feet AGL for a 1 NM radius gate or 800 feet AGL for a 2 NM radius gate. 3.4.3.  Pilots will fly traffic patterns to roll out on final above 200 feet AGL minimum. 3.5.  Aerobatic  Procedures.

In  addition, passengers will not control the aircraft during critical phases of flight (takeoff, landing, and traffic patterns) or below 1,000 feet AGL. 3.14.  Simulated Emergency Procedures: 3.14.1.  The IP will brief all airborne simulated emergencies before flight. 3.14.2.  Pilots  will  not  practice  compound  or  multiple  simulated  emergencies  in  flight,  or initiate simulated emergencies below 300 feet AGL. 3.15.  Nontowered Airfield (NTA) Operations: 3.15.1.  With  the  OG  commander’s  approval,  aircrews  may  conduct  operations  at nontowered, public-use airfields as follows: 3.15.1.1.  Aircrews  will  monitor  the  published  common  traffic  advisory  frequency  and make  all  radio  calls  and  position  reports  recommended  in  the  Aeronautical  Information Manual (AIM). 3.15.1.2.  Pilots  may  fly  rectangular  patterns  (as  depicted  in  AIM),  and  emergency procedures  patterns.  Exception:  Pilots  may  fly  overhead  and  demonstration  patterns during sanctioned competition and training when approved by the airfield manager. 3.15.1.3.  Aircrews  will  immediately  notify  the  operations  supervisor  if  any  hazardous conditions exist at an NTA that would prevent normal operations. 3.15.2.  Each  OG  commander  will  require  and  approve  a  training  program  to  prepare aircrews  to  operate  in  the  NTA  environment.    (T-2).    As  a  minimum,  the  program  will include  a  discussion  of  all  applicable  codes  of  federal  regulations,  advisory  circulars,  and AIM  references  on  NTA  operations.  Training  will  emphasize  standard  civilian  radio phraseology. 3.16.  Functional Check Flights (FCF): 3.16.1.  Do  not  conduct  an  FCF  with  other  type  missions  except  FCF  continuation  training (CT) or FCF upgrade training flights. All FCF requirements will be accomplished by an FCF pilot or a pilot in training status with an FCF IP on board. 3.16.2.  The OG commander may waive a complete FCF and authorize an FCF to check only systems disturbed by maintenance, inspection, or modification.   14  AFI11-2SAILPLANEV3  30 APRIL 2015 3.16.3.

Transfer  of  Aircraft  Control.  Pilots  must  know  who  has  control  of  the  aircraft  at  all times. 3.17.1.  The  pilot  assuming  control  of  the  aircraft  will  state,  “I  have  the  aircraft,”  and  will shake  the  stick.  Exception:  During  high-speed  dive  recoveries,  high-speed  aerobatic maneuvers, or intentional developed spin recoveries, the pilot assuming control will state, “I have the aircraft,” but will not shake the stick. 3.17.2.  The  pilot  relinquishing  control  will  state,  “You  have  the  aircraft.”  Once  assuming control of the aircraft, maintain control until relinquishing it as stated above. 3.18.  G-Awareness Exercise.  The intent of the G-awareness exercise is to prepare the pilot for precise high-G maneuvering and evaluate G-meter readings between cockpits (if applicable). 3.18.1.  Pilots will accomplish a G-awareness exercise on every sortie where they plan or are likely  to  maneuver  above  four  Gs.    Exception:    A  G-awareness  exercise  is  optional  on subsequent sorties with the same crew on the same day. 3.18.2.  A G-awareness exercise will consist of a smooth pull to at least four Gs. 3.18.3.  On  dual  sorties,  pilots  will  crosscheck  G-meter  indications  between  cockpits.  If  a discrepancy exists between the front and rear cockpit G meters, pilots will continue the sortie using the most conservative (highest indicated G) display. 3.19.  Post Flight.  After flight, aircrews will: 3.19.1.  Complete the AFTO 781-series forms and notify maintenance of discrepancies. 3.19.2.  Never leave an aircraft unattended unless it is secured or hangared. AFI11-2SAILPLANEV3  30 APRIL 2015   15  Chapter 4 OPERATING RESTRICTIONS 4.1.  Sailplane Equipment Exceptions.
