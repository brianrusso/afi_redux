The  Line  of  Duty  (LOD)  Determination  and  Its  Objective.  A  member  who  dies  or sustains an illness, injury or disease prior to service, while absent without authority, or due to his or  her  misconduct  is  not  eligible  for  certain  government  benefits.    An  LOD  determination  is  a finding made after an investigation into the circumstances of a member’s illness, injury, disease or death. The finding determines: (1) whether or not the illness, injury or disease existed prior to service (EPTS) and if an EPTS condition was aggravated by military service; (2) whether or not the illness, injury, disease or death occurred while the member was absent without authority and (3) whether or not the illness, injury, disease or death was due to the member’s misconduct.  An LOD determination protects the interests of both the member and the United States Government. 1.2.  Personnel Who May Be Subject to LOD Determinations. 1.2.1.  RegAF members. 1.2.2.  ARC members who die, incur or aggravate an illness, injury or disease while: 1.2.2.1.  On published orders for any period of time, or while on inactive duty; or 1.2.2.2.  Traveling  directly  to  or  from  the  place  the  member  performs  active  duty  or training  or  while  staying  overnight  immediately  before  and  between  consecutive  IDT periods. 1.2.3.  USAFA cadets. 1.2.4.  AFROTC  cadets  who  die,  incur  or  aggravate  an  illness,  injury,  or  disease  while performing military duty or training. Note: AFROTC cadets who die, incur or aggravate an injury, illness or disease during official military duty or training, or while traveling to or from the  location  of  official  military  training,  may  be  entitled  to  disability  benefits  or compensation from the Department of Labor.  See the Federal Employees Compensation Act or  5  U.S.C.  §  8140,  Members  of  the  Reserve  Officers’  Training  Corps,  for  information related to disability benefits external to the Air Force or Department of Defense. 1.3.  Use of the LOD Determination. 1.3.1.  Disability  Retirement  and  Severance  Pay.    A  member  is  not  entitled  to  disability separation  or  retirement  if  the  disability  was  incurred  during  a  period  of  unauthorized absence  or  resulted  from  the  member’s  misconduct  (10  U.S.C.  §  1201,  Regulars  and Members  on  Active  Duty  for  More  Than  30  Days:  Retirement;  §  1202,  Regulars  and Members on Active Duty for More Than 30 Days: Temporary Disability Retired List; § 1203, Regulars  and  Members  on  Active  Duty  for  More  Than  30  Days:  Separation;  §  1204, Members  on  Active  Duty  for  30  Days  or  Less  or  on  Inactive-Duty  Training:  Retirement;  § 1206, Members on Active Duty for 30 Days or Less or on Inactive-Duty Training: Separation and § 1207, Disability from Intentional Misconduct or Willful Neglect: Separation). 1.3.2.   Forfeiture of Pay.  A member may not be entitled to pay if he or she was absent from regular duties for a continuous period of more than 24 hours because of disease that was directly caused by and immediately follows his or her intemperate use of drugs or alcohol (37 U.S.C. § AFI 36-2910  8 OCTOBER 2015   7  802, Forfeiture of Pay During Absence from Duty Due to Disease from Intemperate Use of Alcohol or Drugs). 1.3.3.  Extension  of  Enlistment.    An  enlisted  member’s  period  of  enlistment  may  be extended to include that period of time he or she was unable to perform duties because of his or her intemperate use of drugs or alcohol (10 U.S.C. § 972, Members: Effect of Time Lost). 1.3.4.  Veteran  Benefits.    The  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs  (VA)  may  use  a  member’s official  military  records,  including  any  LOD  determinations,  when  determining  veteran benefits  (38  U.S.C.  §  1110,  Wartime  Disability  Compensation—Basic  Entitlement;  §  1131, Peacetime Disability Compensation—Basic Entitlement). 1.3.5.  Survivor  Benefit  Plan.    If  a  member  dies  on  active  duty  and  In  the  Line  of  Duty (ILOD), the member’s surviving dependents may be eligible for benefits under the Survivor Benefit Plan (10 U.S.C. § 1448, Application of Plan). 1.3.6.  Basic  Educational  Assistance  Death  Benefit.    The  survivors  of  those  Airmen  who were entitled to basic educational assistance and who died while on active duty or within one year after discharge or release from active duty may be entitled to death benefits. (38 U.S.C. § 3017, Death Benefit). 1.3.7.  Emergency  Healthcare  Entitlement  for  ARC.  Nothing  in  this  instruction  shall  be construed to prevent emergency medical treatment at a medical treatment facility for an ARC member  serving  in  a  duty  status  as  provided  in  DoDI  1215.06,  Uniform  Reserve,  Training, and Retirement Categories for the Reserve Components.  An ARC member who presents for emergency treatment and states that the emergent condition is related to an injury, illness or disease incurred or aggravated as a result of a period of duty shall be examined and provided necessary  medical  care  in  accordance  with  (IAW)  AFI  41-210,  TRICARE  Operations  and Patient  Administration  Functions.    The  circumstances  surrounding  the  emergency  medical condition will be resolved after the emergency has been stabilized. 1.3.8.  Medical  Benefits  for  Members  of  the  ARC.    For  ARC,  LOD  determinations  are used  to  establish,  manage,  and  authorize  healthcare.    ARC  members  may  be  entitled  to hospital benefits and medical pensions in certain circumstances (10 U.S.C. § 1074a, Medical and Dental Care: Members on Duty Other Than Active Duty for a Period of More Than 30 Days; 37 U.S.C. § 204, Entitlement). 1.3.9.  MEDCON for ARC Members. ARC members may be entitled to MEDCON benefits in  certain  circumstances  (DoDI  1241.2,  Reserve  Component  Incapacitation  System Management). 1.3.10.  INCAP Pay for ARC Members. ARC members may be entitled to INCAP benefits in  certain  circumstances  (DoDI  1241.2,  Reserve  Component  Incapacitation  System Management). 1.4.  Limits  on  Use  of  an  LOD  Determination.  An  LOD  determination  shall  not  be  used  for the following purposes: 1.4.1.  Disciplinary  Action.  An  LOD  determination  shall  not  be  used  as  a  basis  for disciplinary  actions.    The  LOD  process  is  separate  and  distinct  from  judicial  processes  and   8  AFI 36-2910  8 OCTOBER 2015 other  disciplinary  or  administrative  actions.    Disciplinary  and  administrative  actions,  if warranted, shall be taken independent of an LOD investigation. 1.4.1.1.  An  LOD  determination  does  not  preclude  a  separate  disciplinary  or administrative action.  An LOD determination is not determinative in: 1.4.1.1.1.  Guilt or innocence in a disciplinary proceeding; 1.4.1.1.2.  Pecuniary liability in a Report of Survey; or 1.4.1.1.3.  Any other administrative proceeding. 1.5.  Reimbursement of Medical Expenses.  An active duty member cannot be denied medical treatment  based  on  an  LOD  determination.    Furthermore,  an  LOD  determination  does  not authorize  recoupment  of  the  cost  of  medical  care  from  the  member  (10  U.S.C.  §  1074a;  37 U.S.C. § 204). 1.5.1.  For  an  ARC  member  whose  condition  is  determined  to  be  Not  in  Line  of  Duty (NILOD), only initial treatment for a diagnosis will be provided.   Any follow up care is the responsibility of the member. 1.6.  When  an  LOD  Determination  is  Required.  An  LOD  determination  must  be  initiated, whether the member is hospitalized or not, when the following occurs: 1.6.1.  Death of a member. An AF Form 348 must be completed in every case involving the death of a member in any duty status, to include travel to and from a duty location; 1.6.2.  For RegAF, member is unable to perform military duties for more than 24 hours due to an injury; 1.6.3.  Injury involving likelihood of a permanent disability; 1.6.4.  Injury or disease involving the abuse of alcohol or other drugs; 1.6.5.  Self-inflicted injury; 1.6.6.  Injury or disease possibly incurred during a period of unauthorized absence; 1.6.7.  Injury or disease possibly incurred during a course of conduct for which charges have been preferred under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ); or 1.6.8.  For  ARC,  in  addition  to  the  situations  listed  above,  an  LOD  determination  must  be made when: 1.6.8.1.  The  member  incurs  or  aggravates  an  illness,  injury  or  disease,  or  receives  any medical treatment while serving in any duty status, regardless of the member’s ability to perform military duties; 1.6.8.2.  The  member  dies,  incurs,  or  aggravates  an  illness,  injury  or  disease  while traveling directly to or from the place at which duty is performed; or 1.6.8.3.  The  member  dies,  incurs,  or  aggravates  an  illness,  injury  or  disease  while remaining overnight immediately before and between successive periods of IDT, at or in the  vicinity  of  the  site  of  the  IDT,  if  the  site  is  outside  reasonable  commuting  distance from the member’s residence.  AFI 36-2910  8 OCTOBER 2015   9  1.7.  Additional Requirements. 1.7.1.  An  LOD  determination  is  accomplished  for  a  single  illness,  injury  or  disease  and cannot  be  reused  to  claim  subsequent  benefits  and  entitlements  after  a  member  has  been returned to duty without restrictions pertaining to the original illness, injury or disease. 1.7.1.1.  If there is subsequent service aggravation of the illness, injury or disease, a new LOD determination must be accomplished. 1.7.1.1.1.  For ARC, if not in a duty status, the member may obtain medical treatment for such conditions through the VA. 1.7.2.  A separate LOD determination must be completed for each condition where an LOD determination is required, unless multiple conditions are linked to a single event. 1.7.3.  ARC only. To enter into the DES for a duty-related determination, the member must have  received  an  ILOD  determination  (see  para.  1.10.1)  for  his/her  potentially  unfitting condition(s). See para. 1.10.2.2.2 for the “Eight Year Rule” exception. 1.7.4.  ARC only.  After release from active duty or IDT, members have 180 days to ensure any illness, injury or disease that was incurred or aggravated while in a duty status is reported for  LOD  determination  consideration.    When  the  member  does  not  report  his/her  illness, injury  or  disease,  the  member  is  presumed  to  be  able  to  perform  military  duties,  does  not require  treatment  and  has  no  unresolved  health  condition  rendering  the  member  unable  to meet  retention  or  mobility  standards  IAW  AFI  48-123,  Medical  Examinations  and Standards. The only avenue for addressing previously unreported illness, injury or disease is through the VA. 1.7.5.  Members should not be separated or retired while pending a final LOD determination. 1.7.6.  Members  with  prior  service  in  any  branch  or  component  of  the  Armed  Forces  who incur  an  illness,  injury  or  disease  originating  during  their  service  in  that  branch  or component,  where  an  LOD  determination  has  been  accomplished,  do  not  require  an additional  LOD  determination  unless  the  illness,  injury  or  disease  is  aggravated  during performance  of  current  military  duties.    Document  with  an  Administrative  LOD  (see  para 2.3.1) those situations where no additional LOD determination is required. 1.7.7.  For  members  in  deployed  locations,  an  AF  Form  348  will  be  initiated  at  the  earliest opportunity (preferably while the member is still in the deployed location) and before release from  the  deployment  order  to  enable  post-deployment  medical  treatment  or  other entitlements.    Ensure  hardcopies  of  medical  documentations  accompany  members  to  their home stations. 1.8.  Presumption of LOD Status. 1.8.1.  An  illness,  injury,  disease  or  death  sustained  by  a  member  in  any  duty  status  is presumed to be ILOD.  This presumption may be rebutted when evidence shows the member was NILOD. 1.8.2.  Any medical condition, incurred or aggravated during one period of active service or authorized training in any of the Armed Forces, that recurs, is aggravated or otherwise causes the  member  to  be  unfit,  should  be  considered  incurred  ILOD.    A  new  LOD  determination   10  AFI 36-2910  8 OCTOBER 2015 should  be  initiated  if  the  condition  recurs  after  an  interval  period  of  resumed  fitness  and  is then subsequently aggravated or otherwise causes the member to be unfit. 1.8.2.1.  The origin of such condition or its current state must not: 1.8.2.1.1.  Be due to the member’s misconduct; 1.8.2.1.2.  Have  progressed  to  unfitness  as  the result  of  intervening  events  when  the member was not in a duty status. 1.9.  Standard of Proof for LOD Determinations.  Except where otherwise noted, the standard of  evidentiary  proof  used  in  making  an  LOD  determination  is  preponderance  of  evidence. Preponderance of evidence is defined as the greater weight of credible evidence. 1.9.1.  When determining whether a preponderance of evidence exists, all available evidence must be considered, including: 1.9.1.1.  Direct evidence based on actual knowledge or observation of witnesses; 1.9.1.2.  Indirect evidence, such as facts or statements from which reasonable inferences, deductions and conclusions may be drawn to establish an unobserved fact, knowledge or state of mind; and 1.9.1.3.  Accepted Medical Principles, based on fundamental deductions, consistent with medical facts  that  are so reasonable and logical as  to  create a virtual certainty  that  they are correct. 1.9.2.  Preponderance of evidence is not determined by the number of witnesses or exhibits, but  by  all  the  evidence  and  evaluating  factors  such  as  a  witness’  behavior,  opportunity  for knowledge, information possessed, ability to recall, as well as related events and relationship to the matter being considered. 1.9.3.  Where clear and unmistakable evidence is required to establish a condition is NILOD, it  may  be  provided  by  accepted  medical  principles.    Accepted  medical  principles  may  be discerned  through  reference  to  medical  literature.    Medical  determinations  relating  to  the etiology and onset of a disease or condition may constitute clear and unmistakable evidence when supported by the weight of medical literature. 1.10.  LOD  Determinations.  One  of  the  following  three  determinations  will  be  applied  to  the member’s illness, injury, disease or death: 1.10.1.  In Line of Duty (ILOD). A determination of ILOD is made when the illness, injury, disease  or  death  was  not  due  to  the  member’s  misconduct  and  was  incurred  when  the member was present for duty or absent with authority or when the illness, injury or disease was service aggravated. 1.10.1.1.  For  ARC  members,  this  includes  while  the  member  was  in  any  duty  status (including direct travel status). 1.10.1.2.  Service Aggravation.  A condition is aggravated by military service when there is  a  permanent  worsening  of  a  pre-service  medical  condition,  over  and  above  natural progression,  caused  by  trauma  or  the  nature  of  military  service.    Natural  progression  is the  course  an  illness,  injury  or  disease  would  take  over  time,  regardless  of  military service. AFI 36-2910  8 OCTOBER 2015   11  1.10.2.  Not in Line of Duty (NILOD)-Not Due to Member’s Misconduct. 1.10.2.1.  Absent Without Authority.  A determination of NILOD-Not Due to Member’s Misconduct is made when a formal investigation determined the member’s illness, injury, disease or death occurred while the member was absent without authority; or 1.10.2.2.  Existed  Prior  to  Service  (EPTS)-Not  Service  Aggravated  (NSA).   A determination  of  NILOD-Not  Due  to  Member’s  Misconduct  is  also  made  when  an investigation  determined,  by  clear  and  unmistakable  evidence,  the  member’s  illness, injury, disease or the underlying condition causing it, existed prior to the member’s entry into  military  service  with  any  branch  or  component  of  the  Armed  Forces  or  between periods of such service, and was not service aggravated.  EPTS-NSA conditions include chronic conditions and conditions where the incubation period rules out a finding that the condition started during any period of active duty, active duty for training (ADT) or IDT. 1.10.2.2.1.  Standard of Proof. 1.10.2.2.1.1.  RegAF  and  ARC  members  with  conditions  that  became  unfitting while ordered to active duty of more than 30 days (other than for ADT or IDT).  The  standard  of  evidentiary  proof  used  in  making  EPTS-NSA  determinations  is clear  and  unmistakable  evidence.    Clear  and  unmistakable  evidence  means undebatable  information  that  the  condition  existed  prior  to  military  service  or  if increased  in  service  was  not  aggravated  by  military  service.  In  other  words, reasonable minds could only conclude that the condition existed prior to military service  from  a  review  of  all  of  the  evidence  in  the  record.  It  is  a  standard  of evidentiary proof that is higher than a “preponderance of evidence” and “clear and convincing evidence.” 1.10.2.2.1.2.  ARC members with conditions that became unfitting while ordered to  active  duty  of  30  days  or  less,  or  while  on  ADT  or  IDT.    The  standard  of evidentiary proof used in making EPTS-NSA determinations is preponderance of evidence. 1.10.2.2.2.  Eight Year Rule (10 U.S.C. § 1207a, Members with Over Eight Years of Active Service: Eligibility for Disability Retirement for Pre-Existing Conditions).  An illness,  injury  or  disease  that  is  EPTS  may  be  deemed  to  have  occurred  in  a  duty status for the purpose of determining disability separation or retirement by a Physical Evaluation Board if the member: 1.10.2.2.2.1.  Has at least eight years of total active service; 1.10.2.2.2.2.  Was  on  Title  10,  U.S.C.  active  duty  orders  specifying  a  period  of greater than 30 days at the time the condition became unfitting; and 1.10.2.2.2.3.  Was  not  released  from  active  duty  within  30  days  of  commencing such  period  of  active  duty  under  10  U.S.C.  §  1206a,  Reserve  Component Members  Unable  to  Perform  Duties  When  Ordered  to  Active  Duty:    Disability System Processing, due to an EPTS condition not aggravated during the period of active duty. 1.10.2.2.2.4.  Whether  medical  separation  or  retirement  for  EPTS  conditions  is appropriate under the Eight Year Rule is a finding made in the DES.  While the   12  AFI 36-2910  8 OCTOBER 2015 Eight  Year  Rule  is  not  an  LOD  determination,  LOD  referring  authorities  are responsible  for  identifying  and  referring  to  the  DES  those  EPTS  cases  to  which the Eight Year Rule might apply (i.e., those with members meeting the criteria of this paragraph and having an EPTS condition that is potentially unfitting in terms of retention and/or mobility standards).  This ensures that such cases are entered into the DES and appropriately assessed under the Eight Year Rule. 1.10.3.  NILOD-Due  to  Member’s  Misconduct.    This  determination  is  made  following  a formal  investigation  that  has  determined  the  member’s  illness,  injury,  disease  or  death  was proximately caused by the member’s misconduct.  If the member’s illness, injury, disease or death occurred prior to service, in a non-duty status, or while the member was absent without authority  and  was  proximately  caused  by  the  member’s  misconduct,  the  case  should  be finalized as NILOD-Due to Member’s Misconduct. AFI 36-2910  8 OCTOBER 2015   13  Chapter 2 LOD DETERMINATION PROCESSING  2.1.  Administering the LOD Determination Process.  This chapter governs the processing of LOD determinations for all Air Force components. 2.1.1.  All components will accomplish LOD determinations via an automated LOD system (when available) and will transition to a Total Force automated solution when implemented.  Although modifications will be required to comply with this instruction, no component will be  required  to  abandon  a  currently  operational  automated  LOD  system  simply  because  it cannot be readily altered. 2.1.2.  Responsibilities.  Military  Medical  Providers,  Commanders  and  Staff  Judge Advocates  (SJA)  who  learn  of  a  member’s  illness,  injury,  disease  or  death  that  occurred under  circumstances  that  may  warrant  an  LOD  determination  shall  take  an  active  role  in ensuring that an LOD determination is initiated.  (T-1) 2.1.3.  The  Force  Support  Squadron  (FSS)  or  LOD  Program  Manager  (PM)  that  serves  the immediate  commander  is  responsible  for  directing  the  LOD  determination  to  the  required authorities, monitoring suspenses and disposing of final documentation.  (T-1) 2.1.4.  The  LOD  determination  must  be  processed  IAW  processing  timelines  in  Table  2.1. (T-1) 2.1.5.  Compliance. Processing will be included as part of the Unit Effectiveness Inspections (UEI) managed by the LOD PM.  (T-1) 2.1.5.1.  ARC  only.    The  LOD  PM  (see  para.  2.2.4)  will  evaluate  10%  of  all  LOD determinations on an annual basis for accuracy, timeliness and consistency, and provide a written report to commanders.  (T-1) 2.1.5.2.  AFR only.  HQ AFRC/SGP will conduct quarterly quality assurance reviews on 10%  of  all  AFR  LOD  determinations  for  accuracy,  consistency  and  timeliness,  and  provide a written report to AFRC/CV. 2.2.  General Roles and Responsibilities. 2.2.1.  Member.    When  a  member  incurs  or  aggravates  an  injury,  illness  or  disease  while serving in a duty status, the medical condition must be promptly reported within 24 hours to the  member's  commander  and  servicing  medical  facility/unit.    (T-1)    For  ARC  members, when not in a duty status, the medical condition must be promptly reported (ideally within 72 hours or less) to the member's commander and servicing medical facility/unit. (T-1) 2.2.1.1.  Failure  to report the injury, illness or  disease in  a timely  manner will require a written explanation to the commander and servicing medical facility/unit.  (T-1) 2.2.1.2.  For  ARC,  members  who  fail to  provide  relevant  supporting  medical documentation  within  5  working  days  of  notification  of  the  injury,  illness  or  disease  to the military medical provider may be processed for non-compliance.  (T-1)  IAW AFI 48-123, a member with a known medical or dental condition who refuses to comply with a request for medical information or evaluation is considered medically unfit for continued   14  AFI 36-2910  8 OCTOBER 2015 military duty and will be referred to the member’s immediate commander for processing IAW  AFI  36-3209,  Separation  and  Retirement  Procedures  for  Air  National  Guard  and Air Force Reserve Members. 2.2.1.3.  For  ARC  members  redeploying  to  home  station,  obtain  hardcopy  medical documentation IAW para. 1.7.7. 2.2.2.  Military Medical  Provider. The military medical provider shall initiate and process an LOD determination within 5 working days of seeing a member and receiving supporting medical  documentation  under  any  of  the  circumstances  outlined  in  para.  1.6.    (T-1)    The military  medical  provider  responsible  for  initiating  the  LOD  determination  is  the  one  who provided initial treatment or is assigned to the military treatment facility (MTF) closest to the civilian  facility  where  initial  treatment  was  provided  or  is  the  member’s  servicing  Reserve Medical Unit  (RMU) or  Guard Medical Unit  (GMU).  Civilian  medical documentation  and diagnoses  are  reviewed  by  a  military  medical  provider  who  provides  a  medical  opinion  on the  member’s  illness,  injury,  disease,  death  or  the  underlying  condition  causing  it.    The medical provider must: 2.2.2.1.  Be  credentialed  and  privileged  IAW  AFI  44-119,  Medical  Quality  Operations (T-1); 2.2.2.2.  Either  create  an  administrative  entry  in  the  member’s  medical  record  or complete AF Form 348 (T-1); and 2.2.2.3.  Identify  a  specific  diagnosis  [International  Classification  of  Diseases  (ICD) code].(T-1)  Note:  ARC  Medical  Units  will  document  Administrative  LOD  (see  para 2.3.1) determinations and initiate the Informal or Formal LOD process if not completed by the initial MTF.  (T-1)   2.2.3.  LOD-Medical Focal Point (LOD-MFP).  The LOD-MFP is appointed in writing by the  RegAF  Medical  Commander  or  RMU/GMU  Commander.    (T-1)    The  LOD-MFP  is responsible for routing the LOD determination to the next coordinator IAW Table 2.1.  (T-2) 2.2.3.1.

On  a  quarterly  basis  (when  Total  Force automated  system  is  available),  Headquarters  AFRC/CC  and  ANGRC/CC  will  report  to SAF/MR the timeliness of finalized Informal and Formal LOD determinations for AFR and ANG  members  (T-0).    The  report  will  reflect  timeliness  for  Informal  and  Formal  LOD determinations and the average time required for  each step in the ARC LOD determination process IAW Table 2.1. 2.2.6.  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  (SAF).    The  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force,  or  his  or  her designee,  may  make  changes  to  an  LOD  determination,  after  consideration  by  the  SAF Personnel Council (Air Force Personnel Board).  (T-0)  (see Headquarters Air Force Mission Directive  1-24,  Assistant  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  (Manpower  and  Reserve  Affairs)  and SAF/MR Memorandum, Re-delegation of Authority for Individual Personnel Actions)  While this authority is  not limited to actions or  cases within the DES, such  consideration of LOD changes typically arises pursuant to SAF Personnel Council action or recommendation on a member's  retirement  or  separation  for  physical  disability.    (see  AFI  36-3212,  Physical Evaluation for Retention, Retirement, and Separation) 2.2.7.  Disability Evaluation System (DES).

Return determination and  reason(s) for the request. the  case  with  a  memorandum  requesting  review  of  the  LOD 2.3.  Types and Processing of LODs. 2.3.1.  Administrative LOD. 2.3.1.1.  When  the  military  medical  provider  sees  a  member  under  any  of  the circumstances outlined in para. 2.3.1.2, he or she annotates the injury, illness or disease on  a  Standard  Form  600,  Chronological  Record of  Medical  Care,  or  electronic  medical record. 2.3.1.2.  The medical provider makes an administrative determination that the member’s condition is ILOD when he or she determines the illness, injury or disease was incurred in a duty status under the following circumstances: 2.3.1.2.1.  As a hostile casualty (other than death); 2.3.1.2.2.  As a passenger in a common carrier or military aircraft; 2.3.1.2.3.  The injury, illness or disease clearly did not involve misconduct, abuse of drugs or alcohol or self-injurious behavior; or 2.3.1.2.4.  The  injury  or  illness  is  simple,  such  as  a  sprain,  contusion  or  minor fracture, and is not likely to result in permanent disability. 2.3.1.2.5.  For ARC, the medical provider may make an administrative determination to  document  a  minor  condition  as  ILOD  if  there  is  no  likelihood  of  permanent disability, hospitalization or requirement for continuing medical treatment.   16  AFI 36-2910  8 OCTOBER 2015 2.3.1.3.  The Administrative LOD determination is final and no further action is required. 2.3.2.  Informal  LODs.    When  administrative  processing  is  not  appropriate,  an  Informal LOD determination is initiated on an AF Form 348.  See Attachment 2 for additional LOD determination situations. 2.3.2.1.  For  ARC  members  serving  in  a  duty  status,  Informal  LOD  determinations  are required for the following circumstances: 2.3.2.1.1.  When the medical condition involves a disqualifying disease process IAW AFI 48-123. 2.3.2.1.2.  The  member  requires  continuing  medical  care  or  treatment  beyond  the period of duty during which the condition was incurred or aggravated. 2.3.2.1.3.  The  member  requires  hospitalization.    Note:    Visits  to  the  Emergency Room or minor outpatient procedures alone do not constitute hospitalization. 2.3.2.1.4.  When the Eight Year Rule might apply.  See para. 1.10.2.2.2. 2.3.2.2.  Military  Medical  Provider.    The  military  medical  provider  is  responsible  for completing the Military Medical Provider  portion of AF Form 348 and forwarding it to the immediate commander.  (T-1)  The medical provider provides a narrative description of  the  member’s  medical  condition  and  signs  the  form,  but  does  not  make  an  LOD determination. 2.3.2.3.  The  LOD-MFP  facilitates  forwarding  of  the  AF  Form  348  to  the  immediate commander and notifies the LOD PM.  (T-2) 2.3.2.4.  Immediate  Commander.  The immediate  commander  gathers  available information on the circumstances of the member’s illness, injury, disease or death.  The commander is responsible for completing the Immediate Commander portion of AF Form 348 and forwarding it to the SJA.  (T-1)  Note:  To determine the immediate commander, see Table 2.2. 2.3.2.4.1.  The  immediate  commander  determines  if  the  member’s  illness,  injury, disease or death:  (T-1) 2.3.2.4.1.1.  Occurred while the member was absent without authority (T-1); 2.3.2.4.1.2.  Is due to the member’s misconduct (T-1); or 2.3.2.4.1.3.  EPTS  and,  if  so,  whether  or  not  the  medical  condition  was  service aggravated (based on the military medical provider’s input).   (T-1) 2.3.2.4.2.  As  a  result  of  the  investigation,  the  immediate  commander  recommends one of the following on AF Form 348, (T-1): 2.3.2.4.2.1.  ILOD; 2.3.2.4.2.2.  NILOD-Not Due to Member’s Misconduct (only if EPTS-NSA with no indication of misconduct); or 2.3.2.4.2.3.  Formal LOD Determination. 2.3.2.5.  Staff  Judge  Advocate  (SJA).    The  SJA  reviews  the  immediate  commander’s LOD determination recommendation for legal sufficiency. AFI 36-2910  8 OCTOBER 2015   17  2.3.2.5.1.  The  SJA  concurs  or  nonconcurs  with  the  immediate  commander’s  LOD determination  recommendation,  indicates  such  on  AF  Form  348,  and  forwards  it  to the appointing authority.  (T-1) 2.3.2.6.  Appointing  Authority.    The  appointing  authority  reviews  the  immediate commander  and  SJA  recommendations  to  determine  the  proper  LOD  determination  or action to be taken.  (T-1)  Note:  To determine the appointing authority, see Table 2.2. 2.3.2.6.1.  If  the  appointing  authority  finds  the  member's  illness,  injury,  disease  or death to be ILOD, he or she indicates such on AF Form 348. 2.3.2.6.2.  If  the  appointing  authority  finds  the  member's  illness,  injury,  disease  or death to be NILOD (only if EPTS-NSA with no indication of misconduct), he or she indicates such on AF Form 348. 2.3.2.6.3.  ILOD  and  NILOD  (EPTS-NSA  with  no  indication  of  misconduct)  cases are finalized and forwarded to the LOD PM for disposition. 2.3.2.6.4.  If  the  appointing  authority  believes  the  determination  should  be  NILOD (other than EPTS-NSA with no indication of misconduct), he or she indicates such on AF  Form  348  and  appoints  an  Investigating  Officer  (IO)  to  conduct  a  formal investigation of the circumstances surrounding the member's illness, injury, disease or death. This case will be processed as a Formal LOD determination (see para. 2.3.4). 2.3.2.7.  ARC LOD Determination Board.  The ARC Board is a “reviewing authority” for both Informal LOD “questionable circumstance” cases and Formal LODs.  The Board consists  of  AFRC  or  NGB  SG,  JA  and  A1.    In  cases  involving  death  or  questionable circumstances,  LOD  determinations  are  not  considered  finalized  until  the  approving authority makes a determination. 2.3.2.7.1.  Questionable circumstances include, but are not limited to: 2.3.2.7.1.1.  Those involving misconduct, alcohol or drugs, sexual assault, suicide attempts/gestures/ideation, self-mutilation; or 2.3.2.7.1.2.  All formal investigations, reinvestigations and any questionable case the Wing Commander wishes to be reviewed. 2.3.2.7.1.3.  For ANG, medical conditions involving disease processes. 2.3.2.7.2.  The  approving  authority  may  return  the  Informal  LOD  to  the  appointing authority  with  direction  to  conduct  a  formal  investigation  or  to  provide  additional supporting documentation. 2.3.3.  Interim LODs (ARC only). 2.3.3.1.  The immediate commander may issue an Interim LOD determination to establish initial care and treatment pending the final LOD determination. 2.3.3.2.  Do  not  make  an  Interim  LOD  determination  if  there  is  clear  and  unmistakable evidence showing an EPTS condition or clear and convincing evidence that misconduct was the proximate cause of the illness, injury or disease. 2.3.3.3.  The Interim LOD determination is comprised of the completed medical portion of  AF  Form  348,  which  must  contain  a  description  of  the  member’s  illness,  injury  or   18  AFI 36-2910  8 OCTOBER 2015 disease,  and  the  date  it  occurred,  as  well  as  the  completed  immediate  commander’s portion  of  AF  Form  348,  which  must  contain  a  preliminary  finding  of  the  member’s military status at the time the medical condition occurred. 2.3.3.4.  An Interim LOD determination is only valid for 55 days. 2.3.3.5.  The  LOD  PM  forwards  a  copy  of  the  approved  Interim  LOD  determination  to the  ARC  medical  unit  for  filing  in  the  member’s  medical  record  and  to  ensure  no disruption in the member’s medical care. 2.3.3.6.  The  Interim  LOD  determination  is  replaced  upon  completion  of  the  finalized Informal LOD determination. 2.3.4.  Formal  LODs.  A  Formal  LOD  determination  is  made  by  higher  authorities  based upon a thorough investigation conducted by a specially appointed IO. DD Form 261, Report of  Investigation  Line  of  Duty  and  Misconduct  Status,  is  used  to  supplement  AF  Form  348.  For  ARC,  all  Formal  LOD  determinations  require  review  by  the  ARC  LOD  Determination Board. 2.3.4.1.  A Formal LOD determination is required to support a determination of NILOD, unless the condition EPTS-NSA and there is no indication of misconduct. The immediate commander  may  also  recommend  a  Formal  LOD  determination  when  the  member’s illness, injury, disease or death occurred: 2.3.4.1.1.  Under strange or doubtful circumstances; or 2.3.4.1.2.  Under circumstances the commander believes should be fully investigated. 2.3.4.2.  Appointing  Authority.    The  appointing  authority  appoints  an  IO  that  is  a disinterested  officer  in  the  grade  of  Captain,  or  above  and  senior  to  the  member  being investigated.  (T-1) 2.3.4.2.1.  The IO must be appointed in writing.  The appointment letter shall: 2.3.4.2.1.1.  Cite this instruction as authority; 2.3.4.2.1.2.  State the reason for the appointment; 2.3.4.2.1.3.  Designate a suspense date for submission of the report; and 2.3.4.2.1.4.  Justify any deviations from the IO criteria outlined in para 2.3.4.2. 2.3.4.2.2.  When  an  incident  occurs  at  a  location  remote  from  the  appointing authority,  coordinate  with  the  commander  of  the  installation  nearest  to  where  the incident occurred to appoint an IO. 2.3.4.2.3.  The appointing authority reviews the complete investigation file.  (T-1)  He or she may: 2.3.4.2.3.1.  Return the file to the IO for further investigation; or 2.3.4.2.3.2.  Complete DD Form 261, block 13, and if applicable, block 19. 2.3.4.2.3.3.  The appointing authority forwards the file to the reviewing authority. AFI 36-2910  8 OCTOBER 2015   19  2.3.4.3.  Investigating  Officer  (IO).    The  IO  is  responsible  for  examining  the circumstances surrounding the member’s illness, injury, disease or death.  He or she must also: 2.3.4.3.1.  Conduct  the  investigation  in  accordance  with  the  guidance  provided  in Attachment 3, Guide for Investigating Officers (T-1); 2.3.4.3.2.  Complete DD Form 261 (blocks 1-12) (T-1); and 2.3.4.3.3.  Obtain  a  written  legal  review  from  the  SJA  and  then  forward  the investigation report and all supporting attachments to the appointing authority.  (T-1) 2.3.4.4.  SJA.  The SJA serves as a legal advisor to the IO. The SJA will review the IO’s findings  and  recommendations  for  legal  sufficiency  and  provide  a  written  legal  review.  (T-1) 2.3.4.5.  Reviewing  Authority.  The investigation file.  (T-1)  He or she may: reviewing  authority reviews the  complete 2.3.4.5.1.  Return the file to the IO for further investigation; or 2.3.4.5.2.  Complete DD Form 261, block 14, and if applicable, block 20. 2.3.4.5.3.  The reviewing authority forwards the file to the approving authority. 2.3.4.5.3.1.  If the reviewing authority is also the approving authority, note this in DD  Form  261,  block  15.Note:    To  determine  the  reviewing  authority, see  Table 2.2. 2.3.4.6.  Approving  Authority.  The  approving  authority investigation file.  (T-1)  He or she may: reviews the  complete 2.3.4.6.1.  Return the file to the IO for further investigation; or 2.3.4.6.2.  Approve  a  final  determination  on  DD  Form  261,  block  15,  and  if applicable, block 21. 2.3.4.6.3.  For RegAF, route the original report to the FSS for distribution. 2.3.4.6.4.  For  ARC,  route  the  original  report  to  AFRC/A1  or  NGB/A1  for distribution  to  the  LOD  PM  (maintain  current  process  until  Total  Force  automated system is available). Note:  To determine the approving authority, see Table 2.2. 2.3.4.7.  ARC LOD Determination Board (see para. 2.3.2.7). 2.3.4.8.  Distribution  and  Notification  of  LOD  Determinations.    A  copy  of  the  final LOD determination is sent to the immediate commander who notifies the member or the member’s  next  of  kin  of  the  LOD  determination  and  provides  a  copy  of  the  report (excluding legal reviews).  The notification will explain how to request reinvestigation or appeal  and  provide  an  address  where  requests  can  be  sent.Note:    See  Attachment  5, Sample  Format  of  Member  Notification  of  Not  in  Line  of  Duty  Determination  or Attachment  6,  Sample  Format  of  Notification  of  Not  in  Line  of  Duty  Determination  in Death Cases. 2.3.4.8.1.

Purpose.  This  chapter  outlines  program  elements  and  procedures  for  processing  LOD determinations,  MEDCON  and  INCAP  Pay  cases  involving  sexual  assault.    See  AFI  36-6001, Sexual  Assault  Prevention  and  Response  (SAPR)  Program,  for  program  management  and alignment with the processes outlined in this chapter. 3.1.1.  Whether the member files an unrestricted report (see para. 3.2.2.1) or restricted report (see  para.  3.2.2.2),  members  shall  have  access  to  medical  treatment  and  counseling  for injuries and illness incurred as a result of a sexual assault when performing active service or inactive duty training.  (T-0) 3.1.2.  Regardless  of  the  member’s  duty  status  at  the  time  the  sexual  assault  incident occurred, or at the time the member is seeking SAPR services, members can elect either the restricted or unrestricted reporting option and have access to the services of a Sexual Assault Response Coordinator (SARC) and a SAPR Victim Advocate (VA). 3.1.3.  If  a  member  elects  to  transition  from  restricted  to  unrestricted  reporting,  a  new  DD Form  2910,  Victim  Reporting  Preference  Statement  and  an  AF  Form  348  are  needed  to initiate an unrestricted LOD determination. 3.1.4.  In addition to the above, the following applies for ARC: 3.1.4.1.  Continued medical entitlements beyond initial treatment remain dependent on an LOD determination as to whether or not the sexual assault incident occurred in an active service or inactive duty training status. 3.1.4.2.  If medical or mental healthcare is required beyond initial treatment and follow-up, a licensed medical or mental health provider must recommend a continued treatment plan. (T-0) 3.1.4.3.  IAW DoDI 6495.02, Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (SAPR) Program Procedures, the modification of the LOD process for restricted reporting does not extend to pay and allowances or travel and transportation incident to the healthcare entitlement (i.e.,  MEDCON  or  INCAP  Pay).    However,  at  any  time,  the  member  may  request unrestricted reporting and a subsequent unrestricted LOD determination to be completed in order to receive the full range of entitlements authorized IAW DoDI 1241.2, to include MEDCON and INCAP Pay as outlined in this AFI. 3.2.  LOD Determination Processing for Sexual Assault Cases.  A member who has incurred an injury, illness or disease as a result of sexual assault while performing active duty service or inactive  duty  training  must  have  his  or  her  LOD  processed  IAW  DoDI  6495.02.    The  LOD determination  process  will  vary  depending  on  whether  the  member  elects  unrestricted  or restricted reporting (see para. 3.2.2). 3.2.1.

The  Wing  SARC  has  the primary  responsibility  for  ensuring  the  LOD  determination  is  initiated  and  processed IAW Chapter 2.  (T-1)  The Wing SARC initiates the LOD determination by completing the Member Information portion of AF Form 348.  (T-2) 3.2.2.2.  LOD  Determination  for  Restricted  Reporting.    The  primary  purpose  of  the restricted LOD determination is to allow the member to confidentially disclose the assault to  specified  individuals  (i.e.,  SARC,  SAPR  VA  or  healthcare  personnel)  and  receive medical treatment, including emergency care, counseling and assignment of a SARC and SAPR VA, without triggering an official investigation. Note 1: For RegAF, the AF Form 348-R is NOT required. 3.2.2.2.1.

In cases where either the JFHQ SARC or the Wing SARC is unavailable at the time, the available SARC will type the absent SARC’s name in the appropriate block and write “NOT AVAILABLE” in the signature block.  If the Wing SARC is unavailable the JFHQ may initiate the LOD.  If the JFHQ is unavailable the Wing SARC may send the AF Form 348-R to the NGB POC.  When sending documents via email between SARCs, the email must be encrypted. 3.3.  MEDCON and INCAP Pay Processing for Sexual Assault Cases. 3.3.1.  For sexual assault  cases under  unrestricted reporting, as  soon as practicable after the sexual assault report has been filed, the SARC and/or VA will advise the member who is an alleged victim of sexual assault that they may request continuation on active duty or request to be recalled to active duty.  (T-1)  The request options submitted by the member must be decided within 30 days from the date the request was made. 3.3.1.1.

The decision on the appeal must be made within 15 days from the date that the member submitted the appeal.   28  AFI 36-2910  8 OCTOBER 2015 Chapter 4 REINVESTIGATION OF THE FORMAL LOD DETERMINATION 4.1.  Basis for  Reinvestigation.  A  Formal  LOD  determination  may  be  opened  for reinvestigation only if new and significant evidence indicates likelihood of error. The member’s statement alone or disagreement with the determination does not constitute new evidence.  The reinvestigation is limited to addressing only those issues raised by new evidence. 4.2.  Initiating Reinvestigation. 4.2.1.  The  appointing  authority  or  higher  authority,  including  AFPC/JA,  may  direct  a reinvestigation of a Formal LOD determination. 4.2.2.  The  member  or  the  member’s  next  of  kin  may  request  reinvestigation  of  a  Formal LOD determination. To do so, the member or the member’s next of kin must: 4.2.2.1.  Within  45  days  of  receipt  of  a  copy  of  the  final  Formal  LOD  determination, make a written request to the appointing authority that directed the original investigation (T-2); 4.2.2.2.  Attach  new  and  significant  evidence  to  the  member’s  copy  of  the  final  Formal LOD determination; and 4.2.2.3.  Send  the  package  to  the  LOD  PM  that  processed  the  original  LOD determination. 4.3.  Processing a Request for Reinvestigation. 4.3.1.  Only the approving authority may deny a request for reinvestigation. 4.3.2.  The LOD PM reviews the package to determine if new and significant evidence was submitted.    (T-2)    If  it  was  not,  the  LOD  PM  returns  the  package  to  the  requestor  without action  and  with  a  specific  explanation  why  it  was  returned.    (T-2)    If  it  was,  the  LOD  PM forwards the package to the appointing authority.  (T-2) 4.3.3.  The appointing authority may either: 4.3.3.1.  Grant the request and direct reinvestigation; or 4.3.3.2.  Forward  the  case  to  the  reviewing  authority  recommending  the  request  be denied. 4.3.4.  The reviewing authority may either: 4.3.4.1.  Grant the request and direct the appointing authority to reinvestigate the case; or 4.3.4.2.  Forward  the  case  to  the  approving  authority  recommending  the  request  be denied. 4.3.5.  The approving authority may either: 4.3.5.1.  Grant the request and direct the appointing authority to reinvestigate the case; or 4.3.5.2.  Deny the request and forward the package back to the LOD PM.  AFI 36-2910  8 OCTOBER 2015   29  4.4.  Conducting the Reinvestigation. 4.4.1.  If  reinvestigation  has  been  directed,  the  appointing  authority  directs  the  IO  to reinvestigate the case and complete the reinvestigation IAW the timeline specified in Table 2.1.   (T-2)  The appointing authority may appoint a new IO if necessary or desired. 4.4.2.  The  IO  ensures  he  or  she  has  the  complete  file  of  the  original  investigation  and  the request package with new evidence. 4.4.3.  The  reinvestigation  is  conducted  under  the  same  procedures  used  for  the  original formal LOD investigation. It is documented on a second DD Form 261. The IO prepares an addendum  to  the  original  IO  summary.    (T-2)    The  addendum  should  address  the  new evidence  and  its  impact  on  the  case.    (T-2)  The  IO  may  recommend  a  new  LOD determination  if  necessary.    A  legal  review  is  required  if  a  new  LOD  determination  is recommended.  (T-2) 4.4.4.  The  approving  authority  takes  final  action  on  the  reinvestigation  on  the  second  DD Form 261.  (T-2) 4.5.  Distribution of Reinvestigation. 4.5.1.

(T-2)   30  AFI 36-2910  8 OCTOBER 2015 Chapter 5 MEDICAL CONTINUATION (MEDCON) FOR ARC MEMBERS 5.1.  Overview.  The purpose of MEDCON is to authorize medical and dental care for members who  incur  or  aggravate  an  injury,  illness  or  disease  ILOD  and  to  provide  pay  and  allowances while they are being evaluated, treated for or recovering from a service-connected injury, illness or  disease.    ARC  members  may  be  entitled  to  MEDCON  when  they  are  unable  to  perform military duties due to an injury, illness or disease incurred or aggravated while serving in a duty status. 5.1.1.  MEDCON  orders  shall  begin  when  the  condition  renders  the  member  unable  to perform military duties (not necessarily when the injury or illness occurred, when the disease was diagnosed or when the member was released from active duty).  (T-1) 5.1.2.  Entitlement  to  MEDCON  will  precede  Transition  Assistance  Management  Program (TAMP) health benefits (see AFI 41-210).  (T-0) 5.1.3.  The  ARC  Case  Management  Division  (CMD),  a  division  aligned  under  the  Airman and  Family  Care  Directorate,  Air  Force  Personnel  Center  (AFPC),  provides  comprehensive and  efficient  case  management  to  expedite  MEDCON  orders  processing  and  medical evaluation and treatment of members until they either  regain the ability to perform military duties or enter the DES. 5.2.  Eligibility.  MEDCON  eligibility  requires  an  LOD  determination  and  a  finding  by  a credentialed  military  medical  provider  that  the  member  has  an  unresolved  health  condition requiring treatment that renders the member unable to meet retention or mobility standards IAW AFI 48-123.  (T-1) 5.2.1.  Members  who  meet  eligibility  criteria  for  MEDCON  must  volunteer  for  retention  or recall  to  duty  under  10  U.S.C.  §  12301(h),  Reserve  Components  Generally,10  U.S.C.  § 12322,  Active  Duty  for  Health  Care,  or  other  appropriate  authority  for  Reserve  Personnel Appropriation (RPA) or Title 32, U.S.C.  (T-0) 5.2.1.1.  Members  who  decline  or  are  found  ineligible  for  MEDCON  orders  may  be eligible for and elect INCAP Pay IAW Chapter 6. 5.2.1.2.  Members  eligible  for  MEDCON  shall  not  be  directed  to  accept  INCAP  Pay  in lieu of MEDCON.  (T-1) 5.2.2.  Not all conditions that restrict deployment or mobility establish MEDCON eligibility.  Injuries  or  illnesses  that  are  expected  to  resolve  without  interventions,  without  restorative care  or  within  30  days  are  generally  NOT  eligible  conditions.  Cases  requiring  surgical interventions with recovery times of less than 30 days may be eligible. 5.2.3.  A member who can perform military duties but requires medical care for a minor or chronic medical condition may be provided medical treatment for such condition through the VA or TRICARE benefits; the member does not have to be on MEDCON orders to receive medical  care  for  an  ILOD  condition.    Additional  information  can  be  obtained  from  the member’s RMU/GMU, MTF TRICARE office or VA. AFI 36-2910  8 OCTOBER 2015   31  5.2.4.  A  member  with  multiple  LOD  conditions,  delayed  onset  conditions  or  sequential MEDCON orders may be referred by the ARC CMD for a comprehensive health evaluation at  an  MTF  specialty  platform,  or  other  capable  government  medical  facility.    The  results from  this  health  evaluation  will  form  the  basis  for  determining  initial  or  continuing MEDCON eligibility and potential referral to the DES.  (T-1) 5.2.5.  A member is not entitled to benefits if the injury, illness or disease was not incurred or aggravated in an authorized duty status or was the result of the misconduct of the member. 5.2.5.1.  Should  the  LOD  Approving  or  Appointing  Authority  find  the  injury,  illness  or disease was not incurred or aggravated in  an authorized duty  status or was the result of the member’s misconduct, action will be taken immediately to terminate healthcare and pay  and  allowances.    (T-1)    Members  shall  be  notified  through  the  MEDCON  Airman Responsibilities  and  Consent  Form  (see  myPers  MEDCON  website)  that  pay  and allowances paid to which the member was not entitled are subject to recoupment by the base comptroller through established debt collection procedures.  (T-1) 5.2.6.  Unless  the  member  is  entered  into  the  DES  IAW  AFI  41-210,  the  cumulative  total number of MEDCON days may not exceed 6 months without review by the Secretary of the Air  Force  Manpower  and  Reserve  Affairs  (SAF/MR)  for  potential  termination  pursuant  to para  5.8.2.    (T-1)    If  the  medical  condition  is  projected  to  render  the  member  unable  to perform military duties for more than 6 months, but less than 1 year, a request for extension of MEDCON orders must be made through the ARC CMD and SAF/MR for disposition.  (T-1) 5.2.6.1.  The application for extension beyond a 6 month period should be made 30 days before its expiration date to avoid a break in orders or loss of entitlements.  (T-2) 5.2.6.2.  Applications  to  extend  beyond  a  6  month  period  or  any  subsequent  extensions shall  be  facilitated  by  the  ARC  CMD  and  coordinated  with  the  member’s  RMU/GMU and unit. (T-1) 5.2.7.  Members  who  have  been  discharged/retired,  or  medically  separated  or  retired  as  a result of a DES determination, are not eligible for MEDCON. 5.2.8.  MEDCON  authorization  for  non-emergent  surgery  may  be  considered  IAW  AFI  41-210 and AFI 44-102, Medical Care Management, if the member is unable to perform duties and the surgery is necessary to resolve the ILOD condition or if complications from the non-emergent surgery render the member unable to perform military duties. 5.3.  Roles  and  Responsibilities.  All  parties  involved  with  the  member’s  care,  especially  the member,  shall  exert  maximum  effort  to  provide  support  and  ensure  the  medical  condition  is resolved prior to expiration of the MEDCON orders.

(T-0) 6.1.2.  Unless the member is performing military duties while receiving INCAP Pay for loss of earned civilian income, the member is not considered to be in a duty status while receiving INCAP Pay.  Any subsequent injury, illness or disease that is incurred or aggravated during the INCAP Pay period while the member is not in a duty status is considered NILOD. 6.2.  Eligibility  and  Qualification  Determination.  INCAP  Pay  eligibility  requires  an  LOD determination  of  ILOD  and  a  finding  by  a  credentialed  military  medical  provider  that  the member has an unresolved health condition requiring treatment that renders the member unable to perform military duties, or is able to perform military duties but demonstrates a loss of civilian earned income.

It  is  a  burden  of  proof  that  is  higher  than  a  preponderance  of evidence but lower than clear and unmistakable evidence. Clear  and  Unmistakable  Evidence—  It  is  undebatable  information  that  the  condition  existed prior to military service or if increased in service was not aggravated by military service. In other words, reasonable minds could only conclude that the condition existed prior to military service from  a  review  of  all  of  the  evidence  in  the  record.  It  is  a  standard  of  evidentiary  proof  that  is higher than a preponderance of evidence and clear and convincing evidence. Confidential  Communication—  Oral,  written  or  electronic  communications  of  personally identifiable  information  concerning  a  sexual  assault  victim  and  the  sexual  assault  incident provided by the victim to the SARC, SAPR VA or healthcare personnel in a Restricted Report.

Incapacitation—  Physical  disability  due  to  injury,  illness  or  disease  that  prevents  the performance of military duties as determined by the Secretary concerned, or which prevents the member from returning to the civilian occupation in which the member was engaged at the time the injury, illness or disease was incurred or aggravated. Incurred— To occur as a result of or during military duty. Injury— Damage or harm caused to the structure or function of the body caused by an outside agent or force. In  Line  of  Duty  (ILOD)—  A  finding,  after  all  available  information  has  been  reviewed,  that determines an injury, illness or disease was incurred or aggravated while in an authorized duty status and was not due to misconduct. Integrated Disability Evaluation System (IDES)— The IDES is the joint DoD-VA process by which  DoD  determines  whether  wounded,  ill  or  injured  members  are  fit  for  continued  military service  and  by  which  DoD  and  VA  determine  appropriate  benefits  for  members  who  are   62  AFI 36-2910  8 OCTOBER 2015 discharged  or  retired  for  a  Service-connected  disability.  The  IDES  features  a  single  set  of disability  medical  examinations  appropriate  for  fitness  determination  by the  Military Departments  and  a  single  set  of  disability  ratings  provided  by  VA  for  appropriate  use  by  both departments.  Although includes  medical  examinations,  IDES  processes  are administrative in nature and are independent of clinical care and treatment. the  IDES Intemperate—  Not  temperate  or  moderate;  excessive,  especially  in  the  use  of  alcoholic beverages.

The AF Form 348 is a valid Interim LOD when both the Military Medical Provider and Immediate Commander blocks have been completed. Intervening  Cause—  An  independent  action  occurring  between  the  original  wrongful  act  or omission and the death, illness, injury or disease that turns aside the natural sequence of events and produces a result which would not otherwise have followed and been foreseeable. Intoxication—  A  state  in  which  a  person’s  normal  capacity  to  act  or  reason  is  inhibited  by alcohol or drugs. Medical  Evaluation  Board  Phase— The MEB phase of the IDES includes activities from the point  of  referral  to  the  IDES  to  the  transfer  of  a  completed  MEB  case  file  to  the  PEB administration function. Mental  Responsibility—  The  capacity  to  understand  when  one’s  conduct  is  wrong  and  to conform  one’s  conduct  to  the  requirement  of  the  law.  All  members  are  presumed  mentally responsible for their acts, unless there is contrary evidence. This presumption usually means it is unnecessary to pursue the issue of mental responsibility unless there is credible evidence of lack of mental responsibility. Such evidence may consist of the circumstances surrounding the death, illness,  injury  or  disease,  previous  abnormal  or  irrational  behavior,  expert  opinion  or  other evidence  directly  or  indirectly  pointing  toward  lack  of  mental  responsibility.  Members  are  not responsible for their misconduct and its foreseeable consequence if, as a result of mental disease or  defect,  they  lack  substantial  capacity  either  to  appreciate  that  their  conduct  is  wrong  or  to conform  the  conduct  to  the  requirements  of  law.  The  term  “mental  disease  or  defect”  does  not include an abnormality manifested  only  by repeated wrongful or  otherwise antisocial  behavior. Members  with  impaired  mental  faculties  as  a  result  of  their  own  prior  misconduct,  such  as  by taking  a  hallucinogen,  other  illegal  (controlled)  substance  or  deliberately  ingesting  any harmful/dangerous substance, are mentally responsible. Military Duty(ies)— The duties of a member's office and grade as determined by the Secretary concerned,  and  not  necessarily  the  specialty  skill  or  special  qualification  held  by  the  member prior to incurring or aggravating an injury, illness or disease in the line of duty. Misconduct— Intentional conduct that is wrongful or improper.  Also, willful neglect or gross negligence. AFI 36-2910  8 OCTOBER 2015   63  Non-identifiable Personal Information— Non-identifiable personal information includes those facts  and  circumstances  surrounding  the  sexual  assault  incident  or  that  information  about  the individual that enables the identity of the individual to remain anonymous. In contrast, personal identifiable information is information belonging to the victim and alleged assailant of a sexual assault that would disclose or have a tendency to disclose the person’s identity. Non—active Duty ARC - Part-time duty in the Active Military Service of the United States. A general  term  applied  to  ARC  active  Military  Service.    For  purposes  of  this  instruction,  non-Active  Duty  includes  all  Air  Reserve  Technicians  (ART),  ANG  Technicians,  Traditional Reservist (TR), Individual Mobilization Augmentees (IMA) and Drill Status Guardsmen (ANG) performing the following, to include but not limited to:  mobilization and contingencies, Active Duty  Operational  Support  (ADOS),  Full  Time  National  Guard  Duty,  Military  Personnel Appropriation  (MPA),  Reserve  Personnel  Appropriation  (RPA),  Annual  Training  (AT),  school tours, AD for Training (ADT), Initial AD Training (IADT), Inactive Duty Training (IDT) or Unit Training Assembly  (UTA). These members will require an Informal/Formal LOD.   Note:  Also see Active Duty. Personally  Identifiable  Information—  Includes  the  person’s  name,  other  particularly identifying  descriptions  (e.g.,  physical  characteristics  or  identity  by  position,  rank  or organization) or other information about the person or the facts and circumstances involved that could reasonably be understood to identify the person (e.g., a female in a particular squadron or barracks when there is only one female assigned). Preponderance  of  Evidence—  The  greater  weight  of  credible  evidence.  That  evidence  that, when fairly considered, produces the stronger impression and is more convincing as to its truth when weighed against the opposing evidence. Proximate  Cause—  It  is  the  cause  that,  in  a  natural  and  continuous  sequence  unbroken  by  an independent  and  unforeseeable  new  cause,  results  in  the  death,  illness,  injury  or  disease  and without which the death, illness, injury or disease would not have occurred. Reserve  Personnel  Appropriation  (RPA)—  Money  budgeted  by  the  Reserve  and  National Guard  to  pay  Reservists/Guardsmen  for  performing  Reserve/Guard  or  Active  Duty  related training.  RPA includes the following:  Inactive Duty Training (IDT), Annual Tour (AT), Active Guard-Reserve, Active Duty Operational Support (ADOS) and Special Training (ST). Restricted  Reporting—  Reporting  option  that  allows  sexual  assault  victims  to  confidentially disclose the assault to specified individuals (i.e., SARC, SAPR VA or healthcare personnel) and receive medical treatment, including emergency care, counseling and assignment of a SARC and SAPR  VA,  without  triggering  an  official  investigation.  The  victim’s  report  provided  to healthcare  personnel  (including  the  information  acquired  from  a  SAFE  Kit),  SARCs  or  SAPR VAs  will  NOT  be  reported  to  law  enforcement  or  to  the  command  to  initiate  the  official investigative  process  unless  the  victim  consents  or  an  established  exception  applies.    Only  a SARC, SAPR VA or healthcare personnel may receive a Restricted Report. Secretary  Concerned— The Secretary of the Air Force with respect to matters concerning the Air Force. Self-Inflicted Death— Refers to a death resulting from the actions of the deceased and includes both suicide and accidental death.   64  AFI 36-2910  8 OCTOBER 2015 Separate(d)/Separation—  Severance  of  military  affiliation  as  opposed  to  released from  active duty.  For the purposes of this AFI, separate(d)/separation refers to discharge from the Air Force (either Regular or ARC). Service  Aggravation— The permanent worsening of a pre-service medical condition, over and above natural progression of the condition, caused by trauma or the nature of military service. Sexual  Assault  Prevention  and  Response  (SAPR)  Program—  A  DoD  program  for  the Military  Departments  and  the  DoD  Components  that  establishes  SAPR  policies  to  be implemented  worldwide.  The  program  objective  is  an  environment  and  military  community intolerant of sexual assault. Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Victim Advocate (SAPR VA)— A person who, as a victim  advocate,  provides  non-clinical  crisis  intervention,  referral  and  ongoing  non-clinical support  to  adult  sexual  assault  victims.  Support  includes  providing  information  on  available options and resources to victims. The SAPR VA, on behalf of the sexual assault victim, provides liaison  assistance  with  other  organizations  and  agencies  on  victim  care  matters  and  reports directly to the SARC when performing victim advocacy duties. Sexual Assault Response Coordinator (SARC)— The single point of contact at an installation or  within  a  geographic  area  that  oversees  sexual  assault  awareness,  prevention  and  response training; coordinates medical treatment, including emergency care, for victims of sexual assault; and tracks the services provided to a victim of sexual assault from the initial report through final disposition and resolution. Specialty  Platform— Seven Air Force Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) are designated by AF/SG for MTF Optimization:   Eglin, Elmendorf, Keesler, Langley, Nellis, Travis and Wright-Patterson.  In addition, two Medical Wings, 59MDW Lackland, and 79MDW Andrews, are joint operations providing additional platforms for MEDCON MEBs. Suicide—  Refers  to  a  death  resulting  from  purposeful  action  intended  to  result  in  one’s  own death.  In  order for suicide to  constitute willful misconduct,  the act of self-destruction  must  be intentional.  A person of unsound mind is incapable of forming intent (mens rea, or guilty mind, which is an essential element of crime or willful misconduct). Whether a person, at the time of suicide, was so unsound mentally that he or she did not realize the consequence of such an act, or was unable to resist such impulse, is a question to be determined in each individual case, based on all available lay and medical evidence pertaining to his or her mental condition at the time of suicide.  The act of suicide is, in and of itself, considered evidence of mental unsoundness. If there is no reasonable adequate motive for suicide, as shown by the evidence, the act will be  considered  to  have  resulted  from  mental  unsoundness.    A  reasonable  adequate  motive for  suicide may  only  be  established  by  affirmative  evidence  showing  circumstances  which could lead a rational person to self—destruction.  In all instances, any reasonable doubt should be resolved favorably to support a determination of ILOD. Suicide  Attempts  and  Suicidal  Gestures—  When  reviewing  a  suicide  attempt  or  gesture, consider  all  evidence,  to  include  potential  issues  that  may  serve  as  motivation.    Evidence  of mental  responsibility,  including  an  expert  psychiatric  evaluation,  should  be  obtained  and considered. AFI 36-2910  8 OCTOBER 2015   65  A bona fide suicide attempt, in the absence of any intervening misconduct, raises a strong legal presumption of lack of mental responsibility due to the instinct for self—preservation.  A  bona  fide  suicide  attempt  is  sufficient  evidence  to  rebut  a  presumption  of  mental responsibility. Intentionally  self—inflicted  illness,  injury  or  disease  not  prompted  by  a  bona  fide  suicide attempt may be found to be the result of misconduct unless a lack of mental responsibility can be shown.    In  all  instances,  any  reasonable  doubt  should  be  resolved  favorably  to  support  a determination of ILOD. Unable  to  Perform  Military  Duties—  The  member  is  unable  to  meet  retention  or  mobility standards IAW AFI 48-123, Medical Examinations and Standards. Under the Influence of Alcohol or Drugs— Any intoxication caused by alcohol or drugs that is sufficient to impair the rational and full exercise of the mental or physical faculties. Unrestricted Reporting— A process that an individual covered by this policy uses to disclose, without requesting confidentiality or Restricted Reporting, that he or she is the victim of a sexual assault.  Under  these  circumstances,  the  victim’s  report  provided  to  healthcare  personnel,  the SARC, a SAPR VA, command authorities or  other persons is reported to  law enforcement and may be used to initiate the official investigative process. Willful Neglect— An act or acts of omission or commission that evidence a reckless or wanton disregard for their attendant consequences.  Conduct that indicates a member exhibited a reckless or  wanton  disregard  for  his  or  her  own  personal  well-being  or  for  the  well-being  of  another.  Willful neglect is the same as gross negligence.    66  AFI 36-2910  8 OCTOBER 2015 Attachment 2 LOD DETERMINATIONS FOR SPECIFIC SITUATIONSNOTE:  THE GUIDANCE FOR THE FOLLOWING SITUATIONS APPLIES TO THE REGAF.  APPLICABILITY TO ARC MEMBERS WILL BE BASED ON DUTY STATUS AND THE SPECIFICS OF THE SITUATION.  A2.1.  Alcohol  Abuse.  Drinking,  drunkenness  and  alcoholism  by  themselves  are  not  illnesses, diseases  or  injuries  requiring  an  LOD  determination  to  be  initiated.  They  may  more  properly require punitive or other administrative action. A2.1.1.  Initiate an LOD determination when the member suffers an illness, injury, disease or death because of alcohol abuse. A2.1.1.1.  An injury incurred during the intemperate use of alcohol should be found to be due  to  misconduct  if  it is  proven that  the intemperate  use  of  alcohol  was  the  proximate cause of the injury. A2.1.1.2.  Any acute or transient disease directly caused by or immediately following the intemperate  use  of  alcohol  should  be  found  to  be  due  to  misconduct.  Additionally, organic  diseases  or  disabilities  that  are  secondary  to  alcoholism,  such  as  Laennec’s cirrhosis, fatty metamorphosis of the liver and chronic brain syndrome, should be found to be due to misconduct. A2.2.  Drug  Abuse.  Drug  abuse  itself  is  not  considered  to  be  a  disease  or  an  injury  for  the purpose of requiring an LOD determination to be initiated. A2.2.1.  Initiate an LOD determination when the member suffers an illness, injury, disease or death because of drug abuse. A2.2.2.  Drug  abuse  is  strong  evidence  of  misconduct.  Illness,  injury,  disease  or  death proximately caused by drug abuse should be found to be due to misconduct.  This includes the debilitating effect the drug has on the body and the effect the drug has in impairing the member’s mental or physical faculties affecting his or her actions. The fact that the member may have a preexisting physical condition causing him or her to be more susceptible to the effects of the drug does not, of itself, excuse any resulting misconduct. A2.2.2.1.  Illness, injury, disease or death resulting from drug abuse may be found to be due to misconduct even though the drug abuse was made known as a result of the limited privilege  communication  program,  identified  through  urinalysis  or  incident  to  medical care for other than drug abuse. A2.3.  Explosives,  Firearms,  and  Dangerous  Substances.  Unexploded  ammunition  or  other objects,  firearms,  and  highly  flammable  liquids  are  inherently  dangerous  and  their  handling necessitates a high  degree of care. Tampering  with,  attempting to  ignite, or  otherwise handling such objects in disregard of their dangerous qualities is strong evidence of misconduct. A2.4.  Fights.  Aggression  or  voluntary  participation  in  a  fight  or  similar  encounter,  where  a member  is  at  least  equally  at  fault  with  the  adversary  in  starting  or  continuing  the  fight,  is evidence  of  misconduct.  Additional  evidence  of  misconduct  includes  provocative  actions  or language  taken  or  uttered  under  circumstances  where  a  reasonable  person  would  anticipate retaliation. AFI 36-2910  8 OCTOBER 2015   67  A2.4.1.  There is no misconduct if a member is a victim of an unprovoked assault or acts in self-defense.  Misconduct  may  not  always  be  the  proximate  cause  of  injury  caused  by excessive means. For example where a fight is underway and an adversary uses an excessive means that, under the circumstances, could not reasonably be foreseen. A2.4.1.1.  However,  there  can  be  a  causal  connection  between  the  misconduct  and  the injury  or  death  where  a  member  persists  in  a  fight  or  other  encounter  knowing  that  an adversary has produced a dangerous weapon. Determine each case on its own facts. A2.5.  Joint  Ventures,  Imputed  Misconduct.  A  member  can  be  held  responsible  for  the misconduct of another if the member exercises control over, and is responsible for, the conduct of  the  principal  actor  or  if  the  circumstances  demonstrate  coordinated  action  sufficient  to establish  a  joint  enterprise.  Mere  presence  of  the  member  is  not  sufficient  to  establish  a  joint enterprise or to give a basis for holding the member responsible for the misconduct of another. There  is  no  obligation  to  exert  a  positive  or  constructive  influence  over  the  conduct  of  the principal actor. A2.6.  Motor Vehicle Accidents. A2.6.1.  A  member  who  operates  a  motor  vehicle  in  an  intentionally  wrongful  or  negligent manner that was the proximate cause of an illness, injury, disease or death may be found to have engaged in misconduct. A2.6.2.  A member who knew or should have reasonably known he or she was unfit to drive, and who is injured as a result of driving a motor vehicle when unfit to do so, may be found to have engaged in misconduct. The test for misconduct is whether a reasonable person, under circumstances  and  conditions  similar  to  those  under  which  the  member  drove,  would  or would  not  have  undertaken  to  drive  and  whether  having  elected  to  drive,  the  member’s actions constitute intentional misconduct or willful neglect. A2.6.2.1.  Voluntary  intoxication,  use  of  drugs  or  other  circumstances  that  affect  the member’s mental or physical faculties cause a member to be unfit. A2.6.2.2.  It is not necessarily misconduct when a member has a motor vehicle accident because he or she fell asleep while driving. A2.6.3.  Injury or death incurred while not wearing safety devices such as seat belts or safety helmets  is  one  factor  to  consider.  Standing  alone,  the  violation  of  a  safety  standard  or regulation  constitutes  only  simple  negligence.  The  violation  must,  under the circumstances, amount to gross, willful or wanton carelessness to constitute misconduct. A2.6.3.1.  The  failure  to  use  safety  devices  may  have  nothing  to  do  with  the  proximate cause of the injury or death. For example, the failure to wear a safety helmet may have nothing to do with a motorcyclist who breaks a leg. A2.6.3.2.  In other cases, failure to use safety devices can aggravate the injuries but will not be the proximate cause of the injuries. A2.6.3.3.  Do not focus solely upon whether or not the member was wearing seat belts or other  protective  devices  at  the  time  of  the  accident,  instead  carefully  examine  the  facts and circumstances of each case.   68  AFI 36-2910  8 OCTOBER 2015 A2.7.  Participation  in  Inherently  Hazardous  Off-Duty  Activities.  An  LOD  Determination for a member who participated in inherently hazardous off-duty activities is evaluated the same way  as  any  other  case.  Consider  the  nature  of  the  activity,  its  inherent  hazards  and  the  prior training and experience of the member. A2.8.  Pregnant  Members.  Do  not  perform  an  LOD  determination  for  pregnancy  or  for  any diagnosis associated with pregnancy. Make an LOD determination if the member is unable to do her  duties  for  more  than  24  hours,  there  is  a  likelihood  of  a  permanent  disability  or  in  cases involving an induced abortion in violation of the law of the location of the abortion. A2.9.  Refusal  or  Failure  to  Seek  Medical  or  Dental  Treatment.  Consider  as  misconduct, unreasonable  refusing  or  failing  through  willful  neglect  or  by  design  to  submit  to  medical, surgical  or  dental  treatment,  which  proximately  causes  illness,  injury,  disease  or  death  even though misconduct did not cause the original condition. A2.10.  Residual  Effects  of  Surgery  or  Treatment.  Normal  disability  resulting  from  the surgery or treatment incurred NILOD is likewise NILOD. However, you may find unanticipated residuals from the surgery or treatment as incurred ILOD. A2.11.  Resisting  Arrest/Escape  from  Custody.  Consider any illness, injury, disease or death resulting  from  resisting  arrest  or  trying  to  escape  from  custody  a  result  of  the  member’s misconduct.  The  member  can  reasonably  anticipate  the  use  of  necessary  force,  even  excessive force,  to  restrain  him  or  her.  One  who  engages  in  such  activities  acts  in  disregard  of  personal safety. A2.12.  Suicide,  Suicide  Attempts  and  Suicidal  Gestures.  When reviewing a suicide, suicide attempt or gesture, obtain evidence on the question of mental responsibility, including an expert psychiatric evaluation.  Consider all evidence bearing on the suicide, suicide attempt or gesture and any problem that might serve as motivation for the incident. A2.12.1.  A bona fide suicide or attempt, in the absence of any intervening misconduct, raises a  strong  inference  of  lack  of  mental  responsibility  because  of  the  instinct  for  self-preservation.  A bona fide suicide or attempt is sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption that the member was mentally responsible. A2.12.2.  Intentionally  self-inflicted  illness,  injury  or  disease  not  prompted  by  a  bona  fide suicide  attempt  may  be  found  to  be  the  result  of  misconduct  unless  a  lack  of  mental responsibility  can  be  shown.    In  all  instances,  any  reasonable  doubt  should  be  resolved favorably to support a determination of ILOD. A2.13.  Venereal  Disease.  The  fact  that  a  member  has  a  venereal  disease  is  not,  by  itself, evidence of misconduct.  AFI 36-2910  8 OCTOBER 2015   69  Attachment 3 GUIDE FOR INVESTIGATING OFFICERS (T-1) A3.1.  Duty.  The IO will attempt to determine all the facts leading up to and connected with a death,  injury,  illness  or  disease  and  render  a  comprehensive  detailed  report,  which  includes  a recommended determination of whether or not the death, illness, injury or disease occurred in the line  of  duty.  The  report must  contain  enough  pertinent  data to  enable later  reviews  to  be  made without additional information. A3.2.  Investigate  the  Circumstances.  The IO will ascertain dates, places, persons and events definitely and accurately. A3.2.1.  Consult with the Staff Judge Advocate. The IO should consult with the SJA before beginning the investigation and as often as necessary during the investigation. A3.2.2.  Secure Reports. The IO should obtain copies of all pertinent records including: A3.2.2.1.  Relevant  documents  with  respect  to  the  duty,  leave,  pass  or  unauthorized absence status of the member at the time of the incident resulting in death, illness, injury or disease. When the subject is a member of the USAFR or ANGUS, include information as to his or her status in relation to EAD, ADT, IDT, etc., at the time of the incident. A3.2.2.2.  All relevant military police reports, including summaries of the OSI report. A3.2.2.3.  All  relevant  civilian  police  reports.  While  civilian  agencies  will  make  traffic investigations  available  to  an  IO,  OSI  assistance  may  be  necessary  to  obtain  civilian reports of criminal investigations. A3.2.2.4.  All  relevant  medical  reports  including  analysis  of  blood,  breath,  urine  and tissue. A3.2.2.5.  When  relevant,  information  concerning  the  site  and  terrain  at  which  the incident  in question  occurred and photographs,  maps,  charts,  diagrams or  other  exhibits which may be helpful to a complete understanding of the incident. A3.2.2.6.  For cases involving suicides, suicide attempts or gestures, obtain a copy of the mental health evaluation. If there has been no evaluation and one is necessary, have the member’s commander or the appointing authority request one. Collect evidence bearing on  the  mental  condition  of  the  member,  including  evidence  of  actions  or  moods immediately before the incident, and any problems that might motivate the act. A3.2.3.  Secure Statements. A3.2.3.1.  Statement  of  Subject.  The  report  of  investigation  must  contain  the  sworn statement  of  the  subject  of  the  investigation  (see  Attachment  4,  Sample  Format  for Statements) or an explanation why the statement could not be obtained. A3.2.3.2.  Advise Subject of Rights. A3.2.3.2.1.  Section 1219 Rights. In all cases, the subject of the investigation must be advised  before  being  interviewed  that  10  U.S.C.  §  1219  states:    “A  member  of  an armed force may not be required to sign a statement relating to the origin, incurrence, or  aggravation  of  a  disease  or  injury  that  (he)(she)  has.  Any  such  statement  against   70  AFI 36-2910  8 OCTOBER 2015 (his)(her)  interests,  signed  by  a  member,  is  invalid.”  A  member’s  right  to  make  a statement  is  violated  if  a  person,  in  the  course  of  the  investigation,  obtains  the member’s oral statements and reduces them to  writing, unless the above advice was given first. A3.2.3.2.2.  Article 31 Rights. Advise the subject of his or her rights under Article 31, UCMJ,  only  if  you  suspect  the  commission  of  an  offense.  Consult  with  the  SJA  on the form of the advice. A3.2.3.3.  Witness Statements. Obtain statements of witnesses with relevant information. If witnesses are not available for personal interview, obtain copies of available sworn or unsworn statements made by those witnesses to other investigators. If no such statements are available, arrange where possible, for others to take the statements. See Attachment 4, Sample Format for Statements. A3.2.3.4.  Advise Witnesses. A3.2.3.4.1.  Section 1219 Rights. Do not apply to witnesses. A3.2.3.4.2.  Article  31  Rights.  Do  not  apply  to  civilian  witnesses.  Advise  a  military witness  of  his  or  her  rights  under  Article  31  of  the  UCMJ  only  if  you  suspect  the commission of an offense. Consult with the SJA on the form of the advice. A3.2.4.  Develop  the  Facts.  When  alcohol  is  concerned  in  an  investigation,  thoroughly explore the part it played. Pertinent questions which should be resolved are the amount and type of liquor consumed, period of time during which it was consumed, outward appearance of  the  person  before  the  incident  (staggering,  bellicose,  unable  to  speak  rationally,  etc.). Include the results of any alcohol tests taken shortly after the incident in question. A3.3.  Make  the  Determination.  A  member’s  illness,  injury,  disease  or  death  is  presumed ILOD  unless  the  preponderance  of  evidence  shows  that  the  illness,  injury,  disease  or  death occurred  while  the  member  was  absent  without  authority  or  was  proximately  caused  by  the member’s misconduct. A3.3.1.  Duty  Status  Determination.  An  illness,  injury,  disease  or  death  incurred  while  a member is absent without authority is NILOD. It does not matter whether the illness injury,  disease or death was or was not the result of the member's misconduct. A3.3.1.1.  Rely on the immediate commander’s finding that the member was present for duty or absent with authority unless there is evidence to the contrary. A3.3.1.2.  Inquire  further  into  the  facts  and  circumstances  of  the  member’s  duty  status when the immediate commander finds the member was absent without authority or where there is evidence to indicate the commander’s finding of present for duty or absent with authority  is  incorrect.  For  the  definition  of  the  term  “absent  without  authority”,  see Attachment 1. A3.3.2.  Misconduct  Determination.  Determine  whether  misconduct  was  or  was  not  the proximate  cause  of  the  member’s  illness,  injury,  disease  or  death.  For  explanation  of  the terms “misconduct” and “proximate cause”, see Attachment 1.   AFI 36-2910  8 OCTOBER 2015   71  A3.4.  Compile the Report. A3.4.1.  DD Form 261, Report of Investigation, Line of Duty and Misconduct Status. Serves as a cover sheet and forwarding document. Complete lines 1-12 of the form. A3.4.2.  IO Report. At the conclusion of the investigation, the IO prepares a narrative report. The  report  should  include  a  statement  of  the  authority  under  which  the  investigation  was conducted, identification of any duty time lost, the matter investigated, the facts, a discussion of those facts as they relate to the issues under investigation, conclusions, and a statement of findings.  The  IO  should  clarify  any  discrepancy  in  the  date  and  place  of  illness,  injury, disease  or  death,  or  in  the  evidence  as  to  the  duty  status  of  the  member.  When  relevant, comment on the credibility of statements of witnesses. A3.4.3.  Supporting  Documents.  All  documents  in  the  report  must  be  of  good  quality. Original documents should be in the report to the extent they are available. The documents should be assembled as follows: Figure A3.1.   Supporting Documents   A3.4.3.1.  The  IO  may  add  additional  tabs  as  needed.  If  more  than  one  exhibit  appears under  a  given  tab,  label  the  exhibits  separately;  for  example,  F-1,  F-2  and  F-3.  Where there are no exhibits to include behind a given tab, the tab letter should still appear in the index with the notation “No exhibit, this tab.” A3.5.  Forward  the  Documentation.  The IO  will send  the completed report to  the appointing authority.    72  AFI 36-2910  8 OCTOBER 2015 Attachment 4 SAMPLE FORMAT FOR STATEMENTS Figure A4.1.
