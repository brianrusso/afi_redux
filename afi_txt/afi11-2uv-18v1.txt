They may be combined with CT meetings if all topics are adequately covered. 4.3.3.  Attendance.  Attendance  at  CT  and  IP  meetings  is  mandatory.    The  unit  will determine  a  method  to  track  attendance  of  CT  and  IP  meetings  as  part  of  the  go/no-go process for flight.  (T-2).  Individuals who are not available for CT or IP meetings will read the meeting minutes or be briefed by an operations supervisor before their next flight. 4.4.  Ground Training.  Table 4.1 summarizes pilot ground training requirements.  For ground training  prescribed  by  other  instructions,  units  must  refer  to  those  instructions  for  the  latest requirement.  Initial ground training accomplished during IQT and MQT may be credited toward CT requirements for the training cycle in which it was accomplished. Table 4.1.  Pilot Ground Training Requirements.

Failure  to  complete  sortie  or  event requirements at the end of the training cycle will automatically result in regression until a review is completed to determine continued or additional training.  Refer to AFI 11-402, Aviation and Parachutist  Service,  Aeronautical  Ratings  and  Badges,  for  guidance  on  aviation  service suspension when failure to complete requirements is within the member’s control.  (T-2).  Note: Refer to paragraph 4.13 for guidance on prorating requirements. 4.6.1.  Regression.  MR  pilots  will  regress  to  BAQ  status,  and  BAQ  pilots  will  regress  to unqualified  status  (N-BAQ).    N-BAQ  pilots  will  not  fly  in  the  new  training  cycle  until  the review  is  completed  unless  supervised  by  an  IP.    Pilots  regressed  from  MR  to  BAQ  may continue to fly as an FP or FC under the supervision of an IP until the review is completed. 4.6.2.  Required  Review.  The  reviewer  should  consider  the  type  and  magnitude  of  the deficiency  and  the  pilot’s  experience  level  to  determine  if  additional  training,  increased supervision,  or  a  waiver  to  the  previous  training  cycle  requirements  is  warranted.    The  OG commander (the  NAF DO for a NAF  FE) is  the  reviewer and waiver  authority.  Document this review in the individual’s training folder. 4.7.  Flying  Training  Currencies.  Table  4.3  defines  currency  requirements  for  all  UV-18 pilots.  Any pilot not meeting currency requirements (except for jump currency) will not perform the  sortie  or  event  except  under  the  supervision  of  an  IP.    (T-2).    Refer  to  Attachment  4  for guidance on logging sorties and events for currency and re-currency. Table 4.3.  UV-18 Pilot Currency Requirements.

For  all  aircrew  personnel  except  FSs, requalification requirements follow the guidance in AFI 11-202, Volume 1.  A flight evaluation will complete the requalification process in accordance with AFI 11-2UV-18, Volume 2. 4.8.1.  Table 4.3 lists currency items affecting BAQ. 4.8.2.  When  authorized  by  AFI  11-202,  Volume  1,  and  approved  by  the  OG  commander, pilots  may  complete  a  locally  generated  training  program.    For  this  training,  the  squadron commander  will  develop  an  individual  program  that  takes  into  account  the  pilot’s  previous experience and currency.  The unit will send a copy of the proposed training program to the NAF DO for approval.  (T-2). 4.9.  Loss of IP Status: 4.9.1.  An IP will be decertified for one of the following (T-2): 4.9.1.1.  Failing  a  flight  evaluation.    To  regain  IP  status,  the  IP  must  successfully complete a flight evaluation according to AFI 11-2UV-18, Volume 2. 4.9.1.2.  Failing a qualification or instrument written examination. To regain IP status, the IP must successfully reaccomplish the written examination. 4.9.2.  If  an  IP  becomes  noncurrent  in  an  event  or  sortie  listed  in  Table  4.3,  his  or  her  IP status  may  be  retained.    However,  the  IP  will  not  instruct  in  that  event  or  sortie  until  the required  currency  is  regained.    (T-2).    Supervision  by  another  IP  is  required  to  regain currency. 4.10.  Multiple Qualification Requirements.  Individuals qualified in more than one MDS will complete all of the flying training requirements of this chapter in the UV-18.  (T-2). 4.11.

This waiver will be documented in the individual’s training folder.  (T-2). 5.2.2.  Flying Training.  Prior to certification, upgrade pilots will demonstrate proficiency in mission  planning;  briefing;  reverse  taxi,  uncontrolled  airfield  operations;  precision  and nonprecision  instrument  approaches;  single-engine  pattern,  approach,  go-around,  and landing;  0-,  10-,  and  20-flap  landings;  actual  or  simulated  jump  operations  (including  off- station jump operations); and debriefing.  (T-2). 5.3.  Formation Training.  Formation training consists of training to two levels of certification, formation  pilot  and  formation  IP.    All  upgrade  pilots  will  fly  upgrade  sorties  under  the supervision (in the same aircraft) of a formation qualified IP.  (T-2).  A formation leader will be designated as the individual responsible for the overall conduct of the formation from preflight through post-flight briefings. 5.3.1.  Prerequisites.  Formation pilot candidates must be at least MP qualified.  A formation IP candidate must be IP qualified and formation pilot certified. 5.3.2.  Ground  Training.  As  a  minimum,  ground  training  for  formation  pilot  certification will consist of squadron-developed instruction as defined in the following areas: 5.3.2.1.  Mission  Preparation.  This  training  helps  the  pilot  to  prepare  for  a  formation mission,  including  setting  mission  objectives,  defining  lead  and  wingman  requirements, establishing  responsibilities,  reviewing  currencies  and  capabilities,  and  preparing briefings. 5.3.2.2.  Flight  Briefing.  This  training  prepares  the  pilot  to  conduct  effective  flight briefings.  Flight briefings will cover objectives, use of the briefing guide, flight member involvement, and briefing and debriefing techniques.  Ensure discussion is given to each   18  AFI11-2UV-18V1  19 MARCH 2015 maneuver  and  aids  to  recognize  proper  position  and  techniques.    Ensure  CRM  core curriculum  items  are  incorporated  in  accordance  with  AFI  11-290  and  MAJCOM directives. 5.3.2.3.  Conduct  of  Missions.  This  training  consists  of  control  of  formation,  flight discipline, and training rules and responsibilities. 5.3.2.4.  Emergency  Procedures.  This training consists of additional considerations for handling in-flight emergency procedures in formation. 5.3.3.  Flying Training: 5.3.3.1.  Formation Pilot.  An upgrade pilot will fly a minimum of three sorties (at least one in each seat) and complete all unit-directed training and maneuvers as lead and wing.  Once  certified,  the  pilot  may  lead  formations  and  fly  in  either  seat  with  any  other formation-certified pilot. 5.3.3.2.  Formation  IP.  There  is  no  specific  flying  training  required  for  this  upgrade.  Once  certified,  an  individual  is  authorized  to  upgrade  new  formation  pilots  and  fly formation currency or re-currency sorties. 5.4.  Instructor  Pilot  (IP)  Training.  This  course  teaches  selected  pilots  the  fundamentals  and concepts of instructing and certifies them to perform IP duties.  (T-2). 5.4.1.  Prerequisites.  The IP candidate will be an MP with 150 hours of total UV-18 flight hours.    The  squadron  commander  may  waive  this  requirement.    This  waiver  will  be documented in the individual’s training folder. 5.4.2.  Ground and Flying Training.  All initial IP candidates will complete the formal UV-18 IP course.  Flying training will include an instructor evaluation as defined in AFI 11-202, Volume 2. 5.5.  Buddy  IP  (BIP)  Training.  Units will  assign each new  IP to  an experienced BIP sponsor who will monitor the new IP’s performance and provide guidance in all IP duties until the new IP has completed the ground and flying training requirements provided in paragraphs 5.5.2 and 5.5.3.    The  squadron  commander  may  waive  BIP  requirements  for  rated  pilots  with  previous instructor experience.  Units will document this waiver in the individual’s training folder.  (T-2). 5.5.1.  Prerequisite.  Pilots must complete MQT before enrolling in BIP training. 5.5.2.  Ground  Training.  Before  flying  with  students,  units  will  ensure  each  new  IP  is briefed  on  unit  policies,  the  BIP  program,  instructor  responsibilities,  grading  practices,  CT requirements, scheduling, student training folder management, ground and flying safety, and stan/eval procedures. 5.5.3.  Flying  Training.  The  flying  training  portion  of  the  BIP  program  consists  of  two different kinds of sorties, BIP sorties (with the new IP) and sponsor sorties (with the new IP’s students). 5.5.3.1.  BIP Sorties.  The BIP will fly a minimum of one sortie with the new IP during the course of the BIP program.  The objective of this sortie is to further develop the new IP’s  instructional  techniques.    During  the  sortie,  the  BIP  will  discuss  instructional techniques,  planning  profiles,  student  progress,  grading  practices,  local  flying  policies, and common student errors. AFI11-2UV-18V1  19 MARCH 2015   19  5.5.3.2.

A CT sortie will include traffic pattern stalls or power-on stalls; slow flight or steep turns;  precision  and  nonprecision  approaches  (one  simulated  single-engine);  single-engine landing;  single-engine  go-around  or  missed  approach;  visual  flight  rules  (VFR)  traffic pattern; 0-, 10-, and 20-degree flap landings; and full-flap landing (IP only) on a single sortie. (T-2).    (Exceptions:  If  circumstances  prevent  completion  of  all  CT  sortie  events  on  one sortie,  pilots  may  credit  a  CT  sortie  after  completing  remaining  events  on  a  second  sortie.  IPs may credit a CT sortie when completing all events on multiple sorties within 30 calendar days.)  Copilots do not require single-engine events. A4.1.2.  Instructors  should  tailor  the  CT  sortie  to  the  individual  pilot’s  needs,  placing particular  emphasis  on  simulated  systems  malfunctions,  single  engine  operations,  and instrument procedures. A4.1.3.  Pilots  should  also  accomplish  holding,  arcing,  fix-to-fix,  circling,  unusual  attitude recoveries, and a minimum controlled airspeed (Vmc) demonstration (IP only) as required to maintain proficiency. A4.1.4.  Pilots will log a CT sortie on all qualification evaluations.  (T-2). A4.2.  Night Sortie.  Accomplish at least two night landings during the period after evening civil twilight and before morning civil twilight as published in the Air Almanac.  (T-2). A4.3.  Out-and-Back  Mission.  Accomplish a minimum of two sorties with a full-stop landing and engine shutdown at other than the home station.  (T-2). A4.4.  Jump Sortie.  Perform a simulated or actual wind direction indicator drop and simulated or  actual  drop  of  jumpers  to  update  currency.    Regain  jump  sortie  currency  by  flying  a  jump profile (simulated or actual) with a current MP or IP.  (T-2). A4.5.  Landing.  Log a landing when performing any 0-, 10-, 20-, or full-flap landing.  Loss of landing currency affects BAQ and requires the following action (timing starts from date of last landing) (T-2): A4.5.1.  For 46 through 90 days, regain landing currency by accomplishing three successful landings (preferably one each of 0-, 10-, and 20-degree flap settings) under the supervision of a current IP. A4.5.2.  For 91 through 135 days, perform the same actions as in paragraph A4.5.1, plus an instructor-supervised review session (normal, emergency, and instrument procedures). A4.5.3.  For 136 through 180 days, perform the same actions as in paragraphs A4.5.2, plus an  IP-supervised  CT  sortie,  qualification  written  examinations,  and  emergency  procedures evaluation (EPE). Documentation of AF Form 8 is not required. A4.5.4.  For more than 180 days, perform requalification training in accordance with AFI 11-202, Volume 1, and paragraph 4.8 of this instruction.

Accomplish  a  minimum  of  one  takeoff,  departure,  rejoin,  jump position, wing work, and position change as lead or wing.  Regain formation currency by flying an entire formation profile with a current formation IP.  (T-2). A4.8.  Instrument  Approach.  Accomplish  a  precision  or  nonprecision  approach,  including  an EFIS-out  approach.    Regain  instrument  approach  currency  by  flying  an  instrument  approach under the supervision of an IP.  (T-2). A4.9.  EFIS-Out  Approach.  Accomplish  a  non-precision  instrument  approach  using  the standby attitude indicator, standby altimeter, standby airspeed indicator, and RMI as the primary references.  (T-2). A4.10.  Emergency  Procedures  Simulator.  Conduct  EP  training  in  a  Federal  Aviation Administration  (FAA)-approved  training  facility  for  the  aircraft’s  civil  variant.  (T-2).    An emergency  procedure  (EP)  simulator  conducted  during  IQT  may  be  credited  towards  this requirement. A4.11.  Situational  Emergency  Procedures  Training.  Review  each  emergency  procedure outlined in Section III of TO 1U-18(V)B-1 with an IP.  (T-2).  Preferably accomplish SEPT one on one.   However, small, flight-sized  groups are  allowed so  all members  can participate to the fullest  extent  and  share  equal  time  responding  to  emergency  situations.    Teaching  SEPT  may satisfy  the  SEPT  requirement  for  the  IP  who  administers  the  training.    SEPT  may  also  be accomplished in- flight, in a static aircraft, in a cockpit trainer, or in an FAA-approved training facility for the aircraft’s civil variant EP simulator.
