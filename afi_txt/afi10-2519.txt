DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE HEADQUARTERS UNITED STATES AIR FORCE WASHINGTON DC AFI10-2519_AFGM2017-01 25 April 2017MEMORANDUM FOR   DISTRIBUTION C ALMAJCOM/SGs FROM:   HQ USAF/SG 1780 Air Force Pentagon Washington, DC 20330-1780 SUBJECT:   Air Force Guidance Memorandum to AFI 10-2519, Public Health Emergencies and Incidents of Public Health Concern By Order of the Secretary of the Air Force, this Air Force Guidance Memorandum immediately changes AFI 10-2519.  Compliance with this Memorandum is mandatory.  To the extent its directions are inconsistent with other Air Force publications, the information herein prevails, in accordance with AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management.   This memorandum provides substantial changes to the qualifications required to be appointed as a Public Health Emergency Officer (PHEO) or Alternate PHEO.  Further, this GM establishes a new process to provide PHEO coverage for an installation that does not have a qualified PHEO assigned.  Adherence to the content of this GM should minimize the need for a waiver to the requirements for PHEO appointment.  These changes are detailed in the attached document.   This Memorandum becomes void after one year has elapsed from the date of this Memorandum, or upon incorporation by interim change to, or rewrite of, AFI 10-2519, whichever is earlier.   MARK A. EDIGER Lieutenant General, USAF, MC, CFS Surgeon General Attachment:   Changes to AFI 10-2519   2  2.3.6.1.2. (Change) The primary PHEO must be a senior AFMS officer with a clinical degree (e.g., MD, DO, or DVM) and must have either a Master of Public Health (or equivalent) degree, or at least four years of experience in public health or preventive medicine.  For Reserve, the primary PHEO must be a senior AFMS officer with a clinical degree (e.g. MD, DO, or DVM) and with some experience in public health or preventive medicine.  (T-1)  This section does not apply to an ANG GMU. For the ANG guidance, refer to Chapter 6 of this instruction.    2.3.6.1.4. (Change) The alternate PHEO must be a senior Medical Corps or Public Health officer and must have either a Master of Public Health (or equivalent) degree, or at least four years of experience in public health or preventive medicine.  If the primary PHEO is a DVM, the alternate PHEO must be a senior Medical Corps officer.  (T-1)  2.3.6.1.8. (Add) If the MTF does not have the ability to provide a PHEO who meets the requirements as outlined above, they must nominate for appointment the most qualified individual and have a memorandum of agreement (MOA) on file with another fully qualified installation PHEO (this can be from within the same MAJCOM or another MAJCOM or with a sister service PHEO) to provide “back-up” PHEO consultation as needed in the event of a public health incident/emergency.  If unable to coordinate an MOA with another installation PHEO, then the parent MAJCOM PHEO consultant will provide back-up coverage for the installation by default and an MOU indicating such will be kept on file.  (T-2)      BY ORDER OF THE SECRETARY  OF THE AIR FORCE AIR FORCE INSTRUCTION 10-2519 26 JUNE 2015 Operations  PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES AND INCIDENTS OF PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERN COMPLIANCE WITH THIS PUBLICATION IS MANDATORY ACCESSIBILITY:  Publication and forms are available on the e-Publishing website at www.e-Publishing.af.mil  for downloading or ordering RELEASABILITY:  There are no releasability restrictions on this publication  OPR:   AFMSA/SG3X  Supersedes:   AFI10-2603,  13 October 2010 Certified by: AF/SG  (Lt Gen Thomas W. Travis) Pages: 53   This publication implements Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 6200.03, Public Health Emergency  Management  Within  the  Department  of  Defense;  DoDI  6440.03,  DoD  Laboratory Network  (DLN);  GCP  PI&ID  3551-13,  Department  of  Defense  Global  Campaign  Plan  for Pandemic  Influenza  and  Infectious  Disease;  Air  Force  Policy  Directive  (AFPD)  10-25, Emergency  Management;  and  AFPD  10-26,  Counter-Chemical,  Biological,  Radiological,  and Nuclear  Operations.    This  document  provides  guidance  to  protect  Air  Force-led  installations, assets, personnel,  and base population  in  the event  of a public health emergency  or incident  of public health concern.  This Instruction applies to all installations, including those with Limited Scope (LS) or Limited Scope with  Inter-Service Support (LSISS), to activities under Air Force command  (hereafter  referred  to  collectively  as  “installations”),  to  the  Air  Reserve  Component (ARC),  and  to  geographically  separated  units  (GSU),  except  where  otherwise  noted.    Air National  Guard  (ANG)  units  will  follow  the  guidelines  outlined  in  Chapter  6.    The  term “commanders,” as used in this Instruction, refers to commanders at the installation and wing (for ARC) level unless specifically stated otherwise.  For stand-alone Air Force Reserve installations, the Bioenvironmental Engineering/Public Health Office is the local equivalent to a Regular Air Force  (RegAF)  Military  Treatment  Facility’s  Public  Health  Flight.    Failure  to  observe  the prohibitions and mandatory provisions in paragraphs 3.2.8., 3.2.9.2., 3.2.9.3., and 3.2.9.5. of this publication  by  military  members  is  a  violation  of  Article  92  of  the  Uniform  Code  of  Military Justice (UCMJ). Ensure  that  all  records  created  as  a  result  of  processes  prescribed  in  this  publication  are maintained  in  accordance  with  Air  Force  Manual  (AFMAN)  33-363,  Management  of  Records, and  disposed  of  in  accordance  with  (IAW)  Air  Force  Records  Disposition  Schedule  (RDS)   2  AFI 10-2519  26 JUNE 2015 located  in  the  Air  Force  Records  Information  Management  System  (AFRIMS).    Refer recommended  changes  and  questions  about  this  publication  to  the  Office  of  Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Forms 847 from the field through the appropriate functional chain of command. The  authorities  to  waive  wing/unit  level  requirements  in  this  publication  are  identified  with  a Tier  (“T-0,  T-1,  T-2,  T-3”)  number  following  the  compliance  statement.    See  AFI  33-360, Publications  and  Forms  Management,  Table  1.1  for  a  description  of  the  authorities  associated with the Tier numbers.  When complying with official policy, guidance, and/or procedures, a unit may  request  a  waiver.    The  fundamental  aim  of  a  waiver  must  be  to  enhance  mission effectiveness  at  all  levels,  while  preserving  resources  and  safeguarding  health  and  welfare.  When  a  commander  approves  a  waiver,  the  commander  is  communicating  to  subordinates  and superiors  that  the  commander  accepts  the  risk  created  by  non-compliance.    Each  requirement mandated for compliance at the Wing level found within this Instruction is tiered, signifying the appropriate waiver authority to the requirement.  Submit requests for waivers through the chain of command to the appropriate Tier waiver approval authority, or alternately, to the Publication OPR for non-tiered compliance items.  This publication may be supplemented at any level.  All direct  supplements  must  be  routed  to  the  Office  of  Primary  Responsibility  (OPR)  of  this publication for coordination prior to certification and approval. This  Instruction  does  not:  (1)  take  precedence  over  actions  covered  by  AFPD  10-8,  Defense Support of Civil Authorities and AFI 10-801, Defense Support of Civilian Authorities; (2) apply to foreign disasters covered by AFPD 10-25, Emergency Management, AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning and Operations, AFMAN 10-2502, Air Force Incident  Management  System  (AFIMS)  Standards  and  Procedures,  AFMAN  10-2503, Operations  in  a  Chemical,  Biological,  Radiological,  Nuclear,  and  High-Yield  Explosive (CBRNE) Environment; or (3) integrate contingency war planning as a supplement to Air Force Installation response.

Overview.  This  AFI  specifies  the  authority  of  installation  commanders  and  assigns responsibilities for declaring, reporting, and managing a public health emergency or incident of public  health  concern.    Although  ultimate  responsibility  and  authority  for  managing  such incidents  falls  to  the  installation  commander,  the  entire  installation  and  all  functional organizations will have a role to play. 1.1.1.  The Public Health Emergency Officer (PHEO) is one of the key subject matter experts who will serve as a resource to help guide the installation commander during these incidents.  (T-0). 1.1.2.  The Medical Treatment Facility Commander (MTF/CC) (for the ARC, Guard Medical Unit  (GMU)  commander  and  Reserve  Medical  Unit  (RMU)  commander)  has  responsibility for helping the installation commander with medical resources and capabilities.  (T-1). 1.1.3.  This  Instruction  applies  to  military  personnel,  civilian  personnel,  dependents  of military  or  civilian  personnel,  and  contractors  present  on  an  Air  Force  installation (collectively referred to as “non-military personnel”); Air Force facilities; Air Force-owned, leased,  or  managed  infrastructure  and  assets  critical  to  mission  accomplishment;  and  other Air  Force-owned,  leased,  or  managed  mission  essential  assets  overseas  and  in  the  United States (U.S.), its territories, and possessions.  In areas outside of U.S. control, this Instruction applies  to  the  extent  consistent  with  local  conditions  and  treaty  requirements,  Status  of Forces  Agreements  (SOFA),  and  other  applicable  arrangements  with  foreign  governments and allied forces.  Ultimately, U.S. prerogatives and control at overseas locations may require adjustment  to  accommodate  the  sovereignty  interests  of  the  host  nation  (HN),  except  as otherwise  defined  in  applicable  international  agreements,  such  as  SOFAs,  defense cooperation agreements, and base rights agreements. 1.1.4.  In addition, the AFI provides guidance on disease containment planning and response to  a public health emergency or incident  of public health concern.   It  identifies actions that installations/wings must take before, during, and after public health emergencies or incidents of  public  health  concern  to  slow  or  stop  the  spread  of  the  disease  and  ensure  mission continuation.    These  actions  are  summarized  in  a  set  of  standard  Health  Protection Conditions (HPCON) that define appropriate measures to take based on the disease’s mode of  transmission.    This  AFI  is  complimentary  to,  synchronized  with,  and  established  in support of the Air Force Emergency Management program. 1.2.  Public Health Emergencies. 1.2.1.  DoDI 6200.03 defines a public health emergency as an occurrence or imminent threat of an illness or health condition that: 1.2.1.1.  May be caused by any of the following: biological incident, either intentionally introduced  or  naturally-occurring;  the  appearance  of  a  novel,  previously  controlled,  or eradicated  infectious  agent  or  biological  toxin;  zoonotic  disease;  natural  disaster; chemical attack or accidental release; radiological or nuclear attack or accident; or high-yield explosive detonation.   6  AFI 10-2519  26 JUNE 2015 1.2.1.2.  Poses  a  high  probability  of:  a  significant  number  of  deaths  in  the  affected population considering the severity and probability of the event; a significant number of serious  or  long-term  disabilities  in  the  affected  population  considering  the  severity  and probability  of  the  event;  widespread  exposure  to  an  infectious  or  toxic  agent,  including those of zoonotic origin, that poses a significant risk of substantial public harm to a large number  of  people  in  the  affected  population;  and/or  healthcare  needs  that  exceed available resources. 1.2.1.3.  May  require  World  Health  Organization  notification  as  a  Public  Health Emergency of International Concern IAW the International Health Regulations. 1.2.2.  Specifically,  the  following  diseases  and  public  health  conditions  when  taken  in context of morbidity, mortality and geographic proximity to the installation may be grounds for  the  installation  commander  to  declare  a  Public  Health  Emergency  (Attachment  2 provides a template for declaring a public health emergency): 1.2.2.1.  One  or  more  human  cases  of  any  of  the  following  diseases  that  are  unusual  or unexpected  and  may  have  serious  public  health  impact:  smallpox,  cholera,  pneumonic plague, poliomyelitis due to wild-type poliovirus, human influenza caused by novel or re-emergent  influenza  viruses  that  are  causing  or  have  the  potential  to  cause  a  pandemic, severe  acute  respiratory  syndrome  (SARS),  and  viral  hemorrhagic  fevers  (e.g.,  Ebola, Lassa, Marburg). 1.2.2.2.  Any other disease of special military, national, or regional concern (e.g., Dengue fever,  Yellow  fever,  West  Nile  fever,  Rift  Valley  fever,  meningococcal  disease)  that  is unusual and unexpected, may have a serious impact on public health or has a significant risk of spread and/or affecting the mission. 1.2.2.3.  The occurrence of any item listed in Paragraph 1.2.1 that overwhelms the local capabilities  to  respond  to  the  situation,  to  include  requesting  assets  from  the  Strategic National  Stockpile (SNS).  See  Chapter  5 for SNS  planning requirements.    Note:  SNS assets will not be relied upon as part of an installation’s initial response capability. 1.2.2.4.  One or more cases of any disease that requires the use of quarantine to control.  Orders  for  quarantine  or  for  the  apprehension,  detention,  or  conditional  release  of personnel  exposed  to  a  contagious  disease  but  without  confirmed  illness  may  not  be issued  by  the  PHEO  unless  the  installation  commander  has  declared  a  public  health emergency.    A  Notice  of  Quarantine  template  is  provided  in  Attachment  3.    Orders regarding isolation and restriction of movement (ROM) of individuals with a confirmed illness  may  be  issued  during  a  public  health  emergency  or  during  incidents  of  public health concern.  A Notice of Isolation template is provided in Attachment 4. 1.2.3.  Authority for Declaring a Public Health Emergency. 1.2.3.1.  Installation Authority.  The installation commander is the only authority who can declare  a  public  health  emergency  on  an  Air  Force  installation.    Commanders  on  ANG installations will coordinate with their Joint Forces Headquarters-State (JFHQ-State) and the National Guard Bureau (NGB) prior to declaring a public health emergency.  (T-0). 1.2.3.2.  Local  Authority.    Some  states  and  local  governments  can  declare  public  health emergencies covering their jurisdictions. AFI 10-2519  26 JUNE 2015   7  1.2.3.3.  National Authority.  The Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) has the authority to declare a national public health emergency within U.S. borders. 1.3.  Incidents of Public Health Concern. 1.3.1.  There may be situations when a contagious disease or other biological incident has the potential  to  impact  installation  operations;  however,  it  does  not  meet  the  criteria  for  an installation  commander  to  declare  a  public  health  emergency.    These  incidents  of  public health concern must be managed in a similar fashion to a declared public health emergency. 1.3.2.  Incidents  of  public  health  concern  are  defined  as  occurrences  of  an  illness  or  health condition caused by an epidemic, or a serious and potentially fatal infectious agent that poses a substantial risk of human infection, but that does not constitute a public health emergency. 1.3.2.1.  Examples  of  incidents  of  public  health  concern  include  a  single  case  of infectious  tuberculosis,  or  an  adenovirus  epidemic  that  is  contained  before  leading  to  a significant  number  of  deaths  or  long-term  disabilities  and  that  can  be  addressed  using available healthcare resources. 1.3.2.2.  Many  of  the  directives  issued  in  this  Instruction  apply  to  responding  to  an incident  of  public  health  concern.    The  PHEO  will  provide  recommendations  to  the installation commander and/or the MTF/CC (for the ARC, GMU/CC or RMU/CC) on the actions necessary to respond, mitigate, and control the public health incident.  (T-0). 1.4.  Situational  Standards  of  Care.  Public  health  emergencies  may  result in  surge requirements  that  overwhelm  the  response  capacity,  capability,  and  resources  of  medical facilities  and  health  care  providers,  resulting  in  an  inability  to  meet  normal  standards  of  care.  Under  these  conditions,  it  may  be  necessary  to  provide  situational  standards  of  care.    Such situational standards will be directed IAW Enclosure 4 of DoDI 6200.03.  (T-0). 1.5.  Installation Response Plans.  Installations will develop disease containment guidance that summarizes  the  emergency  health  powers  of  commanders  and  ensures  optimum  medical  and non-medical planning for and response to public health emergencies or incidents of public health concern.  (T-1).  This guidance can be a stand-alone Disease Containment Plan (DCP) or part of the  Installation  Emergency  Management  Plan  (IEMP)  10-2.    Plans  will  ensure  force  health protection  and  continuity  of  operations  (COOP)  IAW  DoDI  6200.03,  GCP  PI&ID  3551-13, AFPD  48-1,  Aerospace  Medicine  Enterprise  and  AFPD  10-2,  Readiness,  and  shall  contain  a minimum  of  nine  sections:    references,  tasked  organizations,  situation,  threat  key  assumptions, mission, execution, administration and logistics, and command and control.  (T-0). 1.6.  Overseas  Limitations.  HN  agreements,  governmental  oversight,  and  control  of  overseas installations may prevent commanders from unilaterally implementing many of the provisions of this Instruction.  Ultimately, U.S. prerogatives and control at overseas locations are subject to the sovereignty of the HN, except as otherwise defined in applicable international agreements, such as SOFAs, defense cooperation agreements, and base-rights agreements. 1.6.1.  A  U.S.  military  commander’s  authority  overseas  extends  generally  only  to  U.S. service  members,  civilian  employees  of  U.S.  forces,  U.S.  Department  of  Defense  (DoD) contractor employees (when specified by agreements), and the dependents of these categories of personnel.   8  AFI 10-2519  26 JUNE 2015 1.6.2.  A  commander’s  authority  may  be  limited  in  scope  as  it  pertains  to  HN  personnel.  Overseas installations will review their respective HN agreements and incorporate guidance into existing installation emergency management and response plans (e.g., IEMP 10-2, DCP, and Medical Contingency Response Plan (MCRP)) and agreements.  (T-2). 1.6.3.  Many of the authorities cited in this publication cannot be implemented in an overseas environment  without  the  cooperation  of  HN  authorities,  except  to  the  extent  specified  by governing international agreements. 1.6.4.  Should it be necessary to enter into international agreements to adequately address the requirements  of  this  Instruction,  Major  Commands  (MAJCOM)  and  Commanders  of  Air Force  forces  outside  the  continental  United  States  (OCONUS)  will  consult  AFI  51-701, Negotiating,  Concluding,  Reporting,  and  Maintaining  International  Agreements,  and applicable combatant command regulations to determine whether authority exists, or must be requested, to negotiate and conclude such agreements. 1.7.  ARC and GSU Limitations.  ARC units and GSUs may not have the resident capability or personnel  to  prepare  for  or  respond  to  a  public  health  emergency  or  incident  of  public  health concern.  This will ultimately limit a commander’s ability to implement some of the provisions of  this  Instruction,  to  include  designating  a  PHEO.    As  a  result,  these  LS  and  LSISS organizations  must  rely  heavily  on  civilian  agencies/local  authorities  for  emergency  response.  LS  MTFs  are  defined  as  units  with  less  than  75  assigned  personnel  and  do  not  require  the designation of a PHEO if the supporting MTF’s PHEO performs the duty for the supported MTF.  LSISS MTFs are tenant units on installations where at least two Services share resources. 1.7.1.  Commanders  of  GSUs  will  review  their  respective  emergency  management  and response  plans  and  incorporate  measures  from  this  AFI  that  are  reasonable  and  appropriate given  their  GSU’s  hazard  assessment.    At  a  minimum,  such  measures  will  include coordination of emergency management plans and response procedures with applicable local and/or state authorities.  (T-2). 1.7.2.  The  appointed  state  ANG  Public  Health  Emergency  Officer  (State-PHEO)  or  ANG Public  Health  Emergency  Officer  Liaison  (State-PHEO-LNO)  will  advise  ANG  installation commanders on potential public health emergency situations.  (T-2). 1.7.3.  Commanders  of  ANG  units  not  co-located  on  RegAF  military  installations  shall communicate identified health threats to the DoD installation PHEO in their catchment area.  (T-2). 1.7.4.  For stand-alone Air Force Reserve Command installations the Reserve PHEO shall be familiar with civilian agencies/local authorities for emergency response for that state.  (T-2). 1.7.5.  ARC  units  and  GSUs  shall  negotiate  and  conclude  memorandums  of  understanding (MOU)  or  memorandums  of  agreement  (MOA)  with  appropriate  local  organizations  when necessary to adequately address the requirements of this Instruction.  (T-2). 1.8.  Joint Base Requirements. 1.8.1.  Air  Force  units  in  Joint  Basing  situations,  in  the  supporting  role,  must  comply  with Air  Force  guidance  to  ensure  installation  personnel  are  adequately  protected  and  cared  for during  public  health  emergencies  or  incidents  of  public  health  concern.  IAW  Joint  Basing Implementation  Guidance  (JBIG),  supported/supporting  units  should  implement  MOAs  to AFI 10-2519  26 JUNE 2015   9  establish  standards  of  support.    The  JBIG  also  establishes  procedures  for  adjudicating differences  and  establishing  Common  Output  Level  Standards.  Units  that  cannot  meet  Air Force requirements by exhausting the JBIG adjudication process must coordinate with their Major  Command  (MAJCOM)  to  alleviate  discrepancies.    (T-1).    MAJCOMs  that  cannot resolve  discrepancies  will  coordinate  with  the  appropriate  Headquarters  Air  Force  (HAF) office to determine a solution. 1.8.2.  Air  Force  units  hosted  by  another  component,  NATO,  or  on  a  coalition  base  will follow  the  host  base  protocols.    To  ensure  adequate  protection  of  personnel,  commanders should determine the need for specific protection measures the host base cannot or is unable to provide in order to ensure personnel are adequately protected and cared for during public health  emergencies  or  incidents  of  public  health  concern.    In  cases  where  there  are  no  Air Force  medical  personnel  who  meet  the  qualifications  of  a  PHEO  assigned  to  the  Air  Force unit(s), the commander will contact the host organization and consult with the senior medical officer  for  guidance  concerning  public  health  emergencies  or  incidents  of  public  health concern, and the minimum protection measures needed.  (T-2). 1.8.3.  Joint base AF MTFs that are in a supported role will have the installation commander appoint  the  PHEO.    (T-1).    In  some  joint  base  locations,  it  may  be  appropriate  (through coordination  with  the  tenant  organization)  to  appoint  an  Alternate  PHEO  from  a  Service different to that of the PHEO, especially where a highly specialized skill set exists in a tenant organization.  Joint basing standard operating procedures and tenant organization agreements should reflect the requirement to provide a single coordinated response to any public health emergency or incident of public health concern.   10  AFI 10-2519  26 JUNE 2015 Chapter 2 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.

Failure  by  military  members  to  submit,  when  ordered,  to AFI 10-2519  26 JUNE 2015   27  diagnostic  or  medical  treatment  (IAW  CDC  and  Food  and  Drug  Administration guidelines)  for  the  condition  causing  the  public  health  emergency  or  incident  of  public health concern is a violation of Article 92 of the UCMJ.  (T-0). 3.2.9.6.  In the case of persons other than military personnel, ROM may include isolation or limiting ingress and egress to, from, or on an Air Force installation.  Persons other than military personnel may be required, as a condition of exemption or release from ROM, to submit to  vaccination  or treatment  diagnostics as necessary.  Submitting to  vaccination, treatment, or diagnostic testing for the condition causing the public health emergency or incident of public health concern may be a requirement for returning to work or gaining access  to  an  Air  Force  installation.    In  the  U.S.,  coordinate  all  ROM  actions  involving non-military personnel through the nearest CDC Quarantine Officer and/or SLTT health department officials.  (T-0). 3.2.9.7.  Quarantine  or  isolation  measures  may  be  implemented  in  healthcare  facilities, living  quarters,  or  other  appropriate  buildings  on  an  Air  Force  installation.    These measures do not lessen the responsibilities of the medical unit to provide medical care to infected persons to the standard of care feasible given resources available.  (T-0). 3.2.9.8.  In  the  case  of  ROM  of  persons  other  than  military  personnel  on  U.S. installations,  the  PHEO  will  coordinate  through  his/her  respective  medical  chain  of command  in  relation  to  CDC  actions  under  quarantine  authorities  provided  in  this Instruction;  DoDI  6200.03;  Sections  243,  248,  249  and  264-272  of  Title  42  of  the  U.S. Code;  Parts  70  and  71  of  Title  42  of  the  Code  of  Federal  Regulations  (CFR);  and Executive Orders 13295 and 13375.  (T-0). 3.2.9.9.  With regard to emergency health powers, an installation commander’s authority may be limited in scope as it pertains to HN personnel.

Upon  receiving  a  request  for  exemption  or  release,  the  PHEO  will  immediately provide the information to the installation commander.  (T-0). 3.4.2.  The  PHEO  will  consult  with  appropriate  medical  and  legal  personnel  regarding  the request for exemption or release to ensure he or she is informed of all pertinent facts prior to providing a recommendation to the installation commander.  (T-0). 3.4.3.  The PHEO will provide the requesting member with the commander’s or designated representative’s  written  decision  on  the  quarantine  exemption  as  soon  as  possible,  but  no more than 24 hours after receipt of the member’s initial request.  (T-0). AFI 10-2519  26 JUNE 2015   29  Chapter 4 DISEASE CONTAINMENT PLANNING AND RESPONSE 4.1.  Purpose.  Effective  base-wide  disease  containment  planning  coordinates  unit  capabilities and integrates medical and non-medical measures implemented by all personnel before, during, and after a public health emergency or incident of public health concern. 4.2.  Assumptions.  A biological incident may not result in noticeable effects for hours or days. Responses to a biological incident are further complicated by the variety of potential pathogens, limitations in accurate detection and identification, and disease-specific treatment requirements. 4.3.  Planning.  The more prepared an installation is prior to a biological incident, the greater the potential number of options available for the installation commander to mitigate the effects of the incident.  Sound preparation through disease containment planning will ensure commanders have the  greatest  range  of  options  available  to  respond  to  a  given  trigger  event  while  appropriately balancing  mission  requirements  with  the  risk  to  personnel.    The  EMWG  will  support  the planning  process  by  providing  a  forum  for  disease  containment  planning  and  public  health emergency preparedness and response activities for the installation.  (T-2). 4.3.1.  The  EMWG  will  stand  up  a  public  health  emergency  sub-working  group  or committee, as necessary, to review and discuss health threat situations (e.g., identified spread of human-to-human transmission of highly-pathogenic avian influenza in another country or region) and potential local  actions (e.g., distribution of prophylaxis,  PA guidance, etc.) that may be required.  (T-1).  The public health emergency sub-working group or committee will: 4.3.1.1.  Assist Wing XP (or equivalent as appointed by the installation commander) with development of the DCP as a stand-alone document or as an annex to the IEMP 10-2 (see Paragraph  2.3.1.1).    Installation  disease  containment  and  public  health  emergency response  guidance must  be maintained and current  to  ensure appropriate  enactment  and enforcement during a public health emergency on the installation IAW this document and AFI 10-2501.  (T-1). 4.3.1.2.  Work with the All Hazards Planning Team, a subset of the installation EMWG, to  coordinate  non-medical  procedures  that  support  the  health  risk  and  medical  needs  to public health incidents and emergencies.  (T-3). 4.3.1.3.  Develop procedures for declaring and reporting a public health emergency.  (T-1). 4.3.1.4.  Ensure  local  and  national  statutes  are  reviewed  to  allow  public  health intervention and implementation of ROM measures (to include quarantine and isolation) in a lawful and timely manner.  (T-1). 4.3.1.5.  Identify  personnel  responsible  for  coordination  and  enforcement  of  ROM, quarantine, and isolation measures.  (T-1). 4.3.1.6.  Ensure  protocols  to  address  the  needs  of  persons  subject  to  emergency  health powers are developed in installation plans.  (T-1).   30  AFI 10-2519  26 JUNE 2015 4.3.2.  Coordinate  activities  with  the  MRC  on  disease  containment  or  public  health emergency matters to include mass prophylaxis planning and surge capability requirements.  (T-2). 4.3.3.  Assist  installation  IG  with  the  planning  and  execution  of  disease  containment  and public  health  emergency  response  exercises.    Ensure  planned  exercises  are  done  IAW  AFI 90-201, The Air Force Inspection System.  (T-2). 4.4.  Training.  The  EMWG  will  assist  the  PHEO  to  tailor  the  standard  training  template  (see Paragraph  2.2.5.2.3)  in  order  to  execute  an  installation-specific  Public  Health  and  Disease Outbreak  Emergency  Response  Training  Program  for  installation  senior  leadership  once  every 24 months and track training through EMWG minutes.  Contact AFMSA/SG3X for template (see Paragraph 2.2.6.1.5).  (T-2). 4.4.1.  Public  Health  and  Disease  Outbreak  Emergency  Response  Training  is  a  mandatory requirement for the following installation leadership positions:  (T-1). 4.4.1.1.  Installation Commander. 4.4.1.2.  Installation Vice-Commander. 4.4.1.3.  All Group Commanders 4.4.1.4.  The  following  squadron  commanders  due  to  their  prominent  roles  in  the execution  of  the  provisions  in  this  Instruction:    Aerospace  Medicine,  Civil  Engineer, Logistics Readiness, Medical Operations, Security Forces, and Force Support.  (T-3). 4.4.2.  All  members  of  the  EMWG,  command  chief  master  sergeant  and  all  group  chief master  sergeants,  deputy  group  commanders,  and  other  key  individuals  identified  by  the installation are also highly encouraged to attend.  (T-3). 4.5.  Response.  The following HPCON framework clarifies much of the uncertainty associated with  biological  incidents  and  allows  installation  commanders  to  select  a  response  that  is appropriate  given  the  scope  and  severity  of  the  situation.    The  HPCON  framework  stratifies health-protection  measures  into  categories  beginning  with  simple  standard  precautions  and gradually increasing the  level  of effort  and  costliness  from  category to  category, with  the most intrusive  and  costly  measures  grouped  together  in  HPCON  D.    In  addition,  standardizing  the responses  within  categories  ensures  a  measured  local  response  that  is  understood  by  all—up, down, and across command chains—just like MOPP levels.  (T-1). 4.5.1.  HPCON 0 – Normal Operations. 4.5.1.1.  Other than diseases endemic to the area surrounding the installation, there are no known health risks to personnel. 4.5.1.2.  Personnel are trained and instructed to use standard precautions—such as routine hand  hygiene,  respiratory  hygiene,  diet,  exercise,  vaccinations,  avoidance,  insect  (i.e., DEET,  permethrin),  environmental  arthropod  control  (as  part  of  a  comprehensive integrated pest management control strategy)—to protect themselves and others from the spread of disease. 4.5.2.  HPCON A – Limited Disease Threat. AFI 10-2519  26 JUNE 2015   31  4.5.2.1.  There  is  a  limited  threat  to  personnel  based  on  the  existence  of  a  disease  or unusual  human  health  threat  that  has  the  potential  to  rapidly  move  into  the  local  area.  Note:    The  local  area  will  be  defined  by  each  installation  as  consisting  of  a  pre-determined  distance  or  a  list/map  depicting  by-name  counties  surrounding  the installation. 4.5.2.2.  When  HPCON  A  is  initiated  a  health  alert  is  communicated  to  personnel, making them  aware of the potential  risk.   Functional  personnel  are instructed to  review applicable plans and verify preparation such as training, stocks of countermeasures, force posture,  etc.  Personnel  will  be  instructed  that  if  new  cases  are  identified,  they  should follow  the  directions  given  to  them  by  health  care  personnel,  which  may  include implementing social distancing to prevent disease spread. 4.5.2.3.  Any identified cases of the disease/health threat will be immediately reported via Command and Public Health chains. 4.5.2.4.  Medical personnel will continue to follow standard precautions. 4.5.3.  HPCON B – Moderate Disease Threat. 4.5.3.1.  There is a moderate disease threat and/or a real risk of exposure to personnel due to a significant outbreak of disease in the local area or imminent spread of disease to the local area.  HPCON B would be employed by the Commander if notified by the PHEO that there has been an initial case identification of a contagious disease, such as a novel influenza, or a dramatic increase in  the risk of acquiring a new significant disease from the environment within the local area. 4.5.3.2.  During  HPCON  B,  personnel  will  be  asked  to  take  basic  disease  containment measures  including  implementation  of  strict  hygiene  measures  (i.e.,  no  handshaking; wiping  down  common  use  items/items  located  in  public  waiting  areas  with  disinfectant prior  to  each  shift)  and  avoidance  of  affected  environmental  exposures  (i.e.,  vectors  or contaminated food or water).  Those affected by the disease will also be asked to follow social distancing procedures, which may include self-isolation. 4.5.3.3.  Medical  personnel  will  follow  standard  and  disease-applicable  precautions (i.e., contact, droplet, respiratory, airborne). 4.5.4.  HPCON C – Substantial Disease Threat. 4.5.4.1.  There  is  a  substantial  threat  of  disease  for  personnel  due  to  a  local  epidemic outbreak of a disease with a high morbidity rate, imminent spread of such a disease to the local area, and/or a wide area of contamination that requires special or costly avoidance procedures. 4.5.4.2.  Stringent  disease  containment  measures,  such  as  broad  social  distancing (i.e., school  closures,  cancellation  of  meetings/socials/TDYs,  etc.)  and  possible  medical countermeasures  (i.e.,  distribution  of  prophylaxis,  mass  vaccinations,  etc.)  are implemented  at  this  level.    Alternate  measures,  including  shelter-in-place,  may  be implemented in the event of a wide-area airborne hazard. 4.5.4.3.  Medical  personnel  will  follow  standard  and  disease-applicable  precautions (i.e., contact, droplet, respiratory, airborne).   32  AFI 10-2519  26 JUNE 2015 4.5.5.  HPCON D – Severe Disease Threat. 4.5.5.1.  A local epidemic with a high mortality rate or imminent spread of such a disease to the local area will drive enactment of HPCON D. 4.5.5.2.  Extremely  intrusive  or  costly  disease  containment  measures  (i.e.,  formal quarantine,  mass  evacuation  due  to  wide-spread  contamination,  mass  decontamination, and/or  directing  members  to  exclusively  subsist  on  secure  food/water)  will  likely  be required. 4.5.5.3.  Medical  personnel  will  follow  standard  and  disease-applicable  precautions (i.e., contact, droplet, respiratory, airborne). Figure 4.1.  Health Protection Measures Situation HPCON Example Health Protection Measures Normal baseline Report of unusual health risk or disease Outbreak or heightened exposure risk High morbidity epidemic or contamination High mortality epidemic or contamination 0 A B C D Routine: Standard precautions such as routine hand washing, cough on sleeve, diet, exercise, vaccinations, education, stockpiling, planning, routine health alerts, etc. Limited: Health Alert, communicate risk and symptoms, review plans, verify preparation: training, stocks, posture, prepare to diagnose, isolate, and report new cases Moderate: Strict hygiene (no handshaking, wipe common-use items) if exposed: self-isolate (wear mask or remain home), avoid contaminated water/food or risk area, vector control Substantial: Social distance (limit: meetings, socials, TDYs) shelter in-place indoors or if directed don respirators, mass distribution of medical countermeasures if applicable Severe: Restrict movement (quarantine), mass evacuation, mass decontamination, subsist on secure food/water sources AFI 10-2519  26 JUNE 2015   33  Chapter 5 STRATEGIC NATIONAL STOCKPILE AND MEDICAL COUNTERMEASURE PLANNING REQUIREMENTS 5.1.  Medical Countermeasure Sources.  Public health emergency medical countermeasures are used to prevent or mitigate the health effects of CBRN threats and naturally-occurring epidemics. Medical  countermeasures  include  both  pharmaceuticals  (e.g.,  vaccines,  antibiotics,  antivirals, antitoxins,  etc.)  and  non-pharmaceuticals  for  MTF  personnel  (e.g.,  diagnostics,  ventilators, personal protective equipment such as face masks and gloves, and other devices). 5.1.1.  The SNS is a national repository of prophylaxis and treatment medications, as well as medical  supplies  and  equipment  established  by  the  CDC.    The  SNS  is  designed  to supplement and re-supply SLTT public health agencies in the event of a national emergency.  It  is  capable  of  delivering  vast  amounts  of  medical  countermeasures  (e.g.,  sufficient antibiotics for 10-day regimens for over 400,000 people) within 12 hours to anywhere in the U.S. or its territories.  The SNS is the primary domestic source for medical countermeasures in a large-scale public health emergency. 5.1.2.  Air  Force  installations  will  maintain  a  medical  initial  response  capability  for responding  to  public  health  emergencies  through  the  HSMR  program.    (T-1).    Air  Force Tactics,  Techniques,  and  Procedures  (AFTTP)  3-42.32,  Home  Station  Medical  Response  to Chemical,  Biological,  Radiological,  and  Nuclear  (CBRN)  Events,  provides  additional information on the HSMR program. 5.1.3.  Air Force installations will consider and plan for the use of DoD contingency material stockpiles to respond to a public health emergency or incident of public health concern.  (T-0). 5.1.3.1.  The DoD has established a limited number of contingency material stockpiles in CONUS, Europe, and the Pacific Rim. 5.1.3.2.  The  DoD  has  established  agreements  with  HHS  and  CDC  for  access  to  SNS assets  in  the  event  of  a  domestic  public  health  emergency.    In  addition,  DoD  has  the capability  to  send  medical  countermeasures  from  various  sources  via  the  Defense Logistics Agency to both CONUS and OCONUS military installations. 5.1.3.3.  During  a  public  health  emergency  or  incident  of  public  health  concern,  the installation PHEO will contact  his/her MAJCOM PHEO Consultant and/or HAF PHEO for information on availability of DoD contingency material prior to requesting access to SNS  material.    For  additional  information  on  DoD  contingency  material  stockpiles, contact AFMSA/SG3XP.  (T-2). 5.2.  Strategic  National  Stockpile  Planning  Guidance.  All Air Force installations in the U.S. and  its  territories  must  develop  MOUs/MOAs  with  their  SLTT  health  agencies  to  receive  SNS assets during a public health emergency or incident of public health concern.  This section does not apply to an ANG GMU.  For the ANG guidance, refer to Chapter 6 of this instruction.  (T-1). 5.2.1.  MOUs/MOAs  will  be  signed  by  the  installation  commander  and  the  senior representative  from  the  coordinating  agency  (e.g.,  director  of  the  county/state  health   34  AFI 10-2519  26 JUNE 2015 department) and will be reviewed by the installation base legal office prior to the installation commander’s signature.  (T-1). 5.2.2.  All  MOUs/MOAs  will  contain  a  minimum  of  the  following  sections:  introduction and/or background, purpose of the memorandum, agreement terms and conditions, effective period, modifications or amendments, and termination.  (T-1). 5.3.  Mass  Prophylaxis  Point  of  Dispensing.  A  POD  refers  to  the  set-up  and  operations  of  a mass prophylaxis or vaccination clinic to rapidly distribute and administer medication regimens to  identified  populations  and  to  educate  recipients  about  the  risks  and  benefits  of  the  medical countermeasure  regimen  during  a  public  health  emergency.    This  section  does  not  apply  to  an ANG GMU.  For the ANG guidance, refer to Chapter 6 of this instruction. 5.3.1.  IAW DoDI 6200.03, military installations are prohibited from serving as open PODs for SNS assets.  An open POD is open to the public and available to all members of the local community who arrive for treatment.  Installations may not provide medical countermeasures to non-beneficiary populations.  (T-0). 5.3.2.  Installations are required to  serve as  closed PODs for SNS  assets.   A closed POD is only available to certain  target populations.  Target populations for installations to consider include  initial  victims  or  cases,  emergency  responders,  critical  and  mission-essential personnel, population living on the installation, population working on the installation, or the entire beneficiary population at risk.  (T-0). 5.3.3.  All Air Force installations must have an MPP that is incorporated within their disease containment planning and response guidance (i.e., DCP, IEMP).  The MPP must incorporate prophylaxis  guidance and agreements discussed in  Paragraph  5.2  Contact AFMSA/SG3X for template (see Paragraph 2.2.6.2.6).  (T-1). 5.3.4.  All installations must develop an MOU/MOA with their SLTT health agencies.  This information  can  be  combined  with  the  MOU/MOA  developed  for  receiving  SNS  assets (Paragraph  5.2).  The MOU/MOA must specify the planned installation capability and the planned support capability by the local health agency and contain the components specified in Paragraph 5.2.2  (T-1). 5.4.  Receiving, Staging, and Storage (RSS) Sites. 5.4.1.  Air  Force  installations  are  authorized  to  serve  as  RSS  sites.    This  decision  must  be made by the installation commander in consultation with his/her PHEO and other applicable persons (e.g., MTF/CC, MSG/CC, JAG, etc.).  However, the decision to serve as an RSS site should  be  made  very  judiciously  and  must  consider  the  requirements  of  the  RSS  site,  the ability of the installation to operate the RSS site during a public health emergency or incident of public health concern, and the populations that the material at the RSS site is intended to cover.    This  section  does  not  apply  to  an  ANG  GMU.    For  the  ANG  guidance,  refer  to Chapter 6 of this instruction.  (T-3). 5.4.1.1.  Costs and manpower requirements associated with becoming an RSS site should be incurred by the installation (and not the MTF).  (T-1). 5.4.1.2.  Installations  should  only  serve  as  RSS  sites  in  order  to  assist  with  storing material  designated  for  beneficiary  populations  or  for  other  government  agencies.  AFI 10-2519  26 JUNE 2015   35  Installations should not serve as RSS sites to store material designated for mass civilian populations.  Note:  an exception to this point may be made for ANG installations.  (T-2). 5.4.1.3.  All installations that will serve as an RSS site must develop an MOU/MOA with their  SLTT  health  agencies.    This  MOU/MOA  must  be  separate  from  any  other established  MOUs/MOAs,  signed  by  the  installation  commander,  and  contain  the components specified in Paragraph 5.2.2  (T-1). 5.4.2.  Installations that agree to serve as an RSS site must gain approval prior to signing the MOU/MOA.  (T-1). 5.4.2.1.  The  installation  commander  must  report  the  request  to  serve  as  an  RSS  site through  his/her  chain  of  command  to  the  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  for  approval.    The HAF PHEO will forward the request to the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs and the appropriate geographic combatant commander.  (T-1). 5.4.2.2.  ANG  units  will  coordinate  requests  for  approval  to  be  RSS  sites  through  their chain of command, their JFHQ-State, NGB and not through the DoD.  (T-1). 5.5.  Overseas  Installations.  Air  Force  OCONUS  installations  have  an  initial  response capability  for  responding  to  public  health  emergencies  through  the  HSMR  program.    HSMR provides a capability to manage and treat at least 300 CBRN casualties for at least 24 hours using the 886 AS equipment packages, including AS 886E, Pharmaceuticals. 5.5.1.  Should  a  public  health  emergency  or  incident  of  public  health  concern  occur  at  an OCONUS  Air  Force  installation  and  exceed  the  capabilities  of  the  HSMR  program,  the decision  to  request  additional  medical  countermeasures  must  be  made  by  the  installation commander in  conjunction with  his/her PHEO’s recommendation and should  only be made after a public health emergency has been declared.  (T-3). 5.5.1.1.  The  installation  will  need  to  specify  the  amount  and  type  of  materials  required and describe the scope and details of the public health emergency.  (T-1). 5.5.1.2.  This  request  must  be  made  through  the  installation’s  chain  of  command  to  the Geographic  Combatant  Commander,  who  will  forward  the  request  to  the  Secretary  of Defense.  (T-1). 5.5.1.3.  In  the  event  of  a  larger-scale  public  health  emergency  or  incident  of  public health  concern,  Air  Force  OCONUS  installations  will  receive  additional  medical countermeasures  and  material  from  DoD  contingency  material  stockpiles  or  from  other sources  acquired  by  DoD.    Material  will  be  shipped  via  the  Defense  Logistics  Agency, who  will  send  the  material  through  the  appropriate  Theater  Lead  Agent  for  Medical Material.    OCONUS  PHEOs  will  coordinate  with  the  MAJCOM  PHEO  Consultant  to ensure  appropriate  coordination  requirements  for  requesting  and  receiving  medical countermeasures are described within their disease containment/public health emergency response plans.  (T-2). 5.5.2.  All OCONUS Air Force installations will develop plans to serve as a closed POD to that  installation’s  entire  beneficiary  population.    The  installation  must  have  an  MPP  that  is incorporated  within  their  disease  containment  planning  and  response  guidance  (i.e.,  DCP, IEMP).  Contact AFMSA/SG3X for template (see Paragraph 2.2.6.2.6).  (T-1).   36  AFI 10-2519  26 JUNE 2015 Chapter 6 AIR NATIONAL GUARD 6.1.  Purpose.  This  chapter specifies the role of the Air National Guard (ANG) and the GMU, its  planning  factors  and  outlines  the  flow  of  information  in  the  event  of  a  public  health emergency or incident of public health concern.  It identifies the roles and responsibilities of key players in the reporting and information flow. 6.1.1.  GMUs not co-located with a RegAF installation do not have the resident capability or personnel  to  prepare  for  and  respond  to  a  public  health  emergency.    This  limitation necessitates  the  support  and  interdependence  on  the  civilian  emergency  medical  system, airport  municipals,  or  local  agencies  to  include  state  or  regional  health  departments  and ultimately  limit  the  ANG  wing  installation  commander‘s  ability  to  implement  many  of  the provisions  found  in  this  instruction  and  their  RegAF  counterpart’s  DCP.    As  a  result,  the ANG  installation  must  rely  heavily  on  civilian  agencies/local  authorities  for  emergency response through the use of MAA and MOU.  (T-1). 6.1.2.  ANG  installations  are  authorized  to  serve  as  a  Receiving,  Staging  and  Storage  Site (a.k.a. CDC closed POD site).  This decision must be made by the installation commander in consultation with their Wing-PHEO-POC or Wing-PHEO-LNO and other applicable persons (e.g., State-PHEO-LNO, MDG/CC, MDG/SGP, MSG/CC, JAG, JFHQ etc.) and approved by the joint surgeon (NGB-JSG) and air surgeon (NGB/SGP).  (T-1). 6.1.2.1.  The decision to serve as an RSS/POD site should be made deliberately and must consider  the  requirements  of  the  site,  the  ability  of  the  installation  to  operate  the  site during  a  public  health  emergency  or  incident  of  public  health  concern,  and  the populations  that  the  material  at  the  RSS  site  is  intended  to  cover.    Other  factors  to  be considered  prior  to  applying  to  be  an  RSS/POD  site  include  the  availability  of  24  hour security to safeguard stockpiles of supplies, environmentally controlled warehousing, the physical security of installation, 24 hour access to manpower and transportation vehicles.   Note: all costs associated with becoming and maintaining the RSS/POD site are incurred by  the  installation.    Installations  should  only  assist  with  storing  material  designated  for installation populations or for other government agencies and should not serve as a site to store material designated for mass civilian populations.  (T-3). 6.1.3.  Isolation  and Quarantine.  State health  authorities have the primary  role in  imposing and enforcing quarantine as specified under state law with the use of civilian forces.  ANG installations do not have the resources to support isolation and/or quarantine procedures so it is  critical  that  the  GMU  establish  agreements  with  local  civilian  hospitals.    The  CDC  has certain  limited  authority.    State  resources  must  be  exhausted  or  the  threat  must  come  from outside the country prior to CDC involvement.  (T-3). 6.1.4.  Treatment  and  Ambulances.    ANG  GMUs  are  not  MTFs.      ANG  GMUs  do  not possess,  maintain,  or  operate  ambulances  and  are  not  authorized  to  provide  medical treatment.  ANG installations are dependent upon the local community to respond to medical or  other  emergencies  and  IAW  AFI  41-106  will  have  MAAs/MOUs  with  local  civilian agencies to provide medical transport, treatment and other emergency services.  (T-3).  AFI 10-2519  26 JUNE 2015   37  6.2.  Roles and Responsibilities. 6.2.1.  Governor.    As  the  state’s  chief  executive,  the  governor  is  responsible  for  the  public safety  and  welfare  of  the  people  in  his  or  her  state.    During  a  proclaimed  emergency  or disaster, a governor has extraordinary powers, including the authority to call up the ANG or Army  National  Guard  (NG),  order  evacuations,  access  emergency  resources  including emergency funding, seize property and suspend state laws and regulations. 6.2.2.  The Adjutant General (TAG).  In most states, TAG is appointed by the governor and serves as commander of that state’s military assets to include the ANG and NG.  Some TAGs also  serve  as  the  Director  of  the  Division  of  Emergency  Management  and  Director  of Homeland Security for their state. 6.2.3.  ANG PHEO.  The NGB/SGP Chief of Aerospace Medicine will serve as the primary PHEO consultant for the ANG and will: 6.2.3.1.  Complete PHEO training requirements listed in AFI 41-106.  (T-1). 6.2.3.2.

NGB/SGPM or GS equivalent will assume the role of alternate PHEO and accomplish training as directed by AFI 41-106.  (T-1). 6.2.5.  ANG MEM.  The NGB/SGAX Medical Readiness Officer or GS equivalent will serve as the MEM consultant for the ANG and will: 6.2.5.1.  Complete all MEM training requirements listed in AFI 41-106.  (T-1). 6.2.5.2.  Provide  expertise  and  guidance  to  ANG  installations  on  conducting  emergency response actions.  (T-2). 6.2.5.3.  In  concert  with  the  ANG  PHEO,  provide  ANG-specific  guidance  on  public health  emergency  preparedness  and  planning  activities  to  supplement  guidance  as necessary.  (T-1). 6.2.6.  State Air Surgeon (SAS).  The SAS is the senior military medical officer for the state, charged with creating a framework to facilitate and enable the ANG medical response within the  state  or  region.    Upon  appointment  as  the  SAS,  he/she  will  be  designated  the  State-PHEO-LNO.    If  PHEO  training  has  been  accomplished,  the  SAS  can  become  the  State-PHEO.    In  the  SAS  absence,  the  senior  most  ranking  medical  official/officer  in  that state/district or territories will be temporarily appointed as the acting State-PHEO-LNO.   38  AFI 10-2519  26 JUNE 2015 6.2.6.1.  The  State-PHEO-LNO  shall  provide  input  about  the  state’s  military  medical capability  and  the  availability  of  any  military  medical  resources,  agent-specific information, risk communication, and provide situational awareness of the ANG medical capabilities to the governor, TAG, NGB-JSG, NGB/SG and local GMU. 6.2.6.2.  The SAS monitors their state’s medical statistics to ensure a viable and healthy force for local and worldwide deployment is available.  The SAS coordinates with other SASs  within  the  Federal  Emergency  Management  Agency  regions  and  Emergency Management  Assistance  Compact  (EMAC)  regions  to  identify  and  coordinate  regional military medical response capabilities and operations if needed. 6.2.7.  Joint Force Headquarters-State.  JFHQ-State is responsible to: 6.2.7.1.  Provide  command  and  control  of  all  military  forces  in  the  state  or  territory  for the governor, or in the case of the District of Columbia, the Secretary of the Army. 6.2.7.2.  Support Joint Task Force-State (JTF-State) Commanders and all NG units within the  state,  and  act  as  an  information  channel  to  the  NGB  Joint  Coordination  Center  and combatant commanders for public health emergencies. 6.2.7.3.

JTF-State provides command and control of all state military assets deployed in support of civil authorities or a specific incident, and facilitates the flow of information  between  the  JFHQ-State  and  the  deployed  units.    Specifically,  the  JTFState commander: 6.2.8.1.  Works closely  with the incident  commander in  an effort to maintain situational awareness  of  SLTT  actions  to  ensure  the  adequacy  and  effectiveness  of  response, support, and safety activities. 6.2.8.2.  Serves  as  the  senior  military  commander  on  the  scene  and  is  therefore responsible for the safe and efficient employment of all assigned military forces. 6.2.8.3.  May  request  JFHQ-State  activation  and  deploy  additional  units  (e.g.,  EMAC requests), if additional forces are required. 6.2.9.  GMU/Installation Requirements: 6.2.9.1.  Each  ANG  installation  may  be  unique  in  their  full-time  manning  and  may  not have  the  resident  full-time  capability  needed  to  fully  address  PHEO  program  specifics.  Therefore, based upon the distinctive manning and the installation abilities they shall, at a minimum, appoint one PHEO POC alternate: 6.2.9.1.1.  Wing-PHEO-POC (Required).  Each installation commander will appoint a full-time  Wing-PHEO-POC.    The  full-time  Wing-PHEO-POC  shall  be  any  medical AFSC that resides within the full-time manpower document that has the knowledge to provide information to the SAS on biological/disease outbreaks of significance on or near  the  installation  and  coordinate  response  efforts  in  absence  of  the  SAS/State-PHEO.
