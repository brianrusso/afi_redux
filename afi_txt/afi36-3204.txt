Conscientious Objector. 2.1.1.  Class 1-O. A member who, by reason of conscientious objection, sincerely objects to participation in military service of any kind in war in any form. 2.1.2.  Class 1-A-O. A member who, by reason of conscientious objection, sincerely objects to  participation  as  a  combatant  in  war  in  any  form,  but  whose  convictions  are  such  as  to permit military service in a noncombatant status. Also referred to as noncombatant duties or noncombatant service. 2.2.  Establishing  Claim.  The  applicant  for  CO  status  bears  the  burden  of  establishing conscientious  objection  as  grounds  for  separation  or  assignment  to  noncombatant  training  and service. The applicant must establish by clear and convincing evidence that: 2.2.1.  The nature or basis of the claim falls under the definition of conscientious objections described in this AFI (T-1) 2.2.2.  The applicant's belief is honest, sincere, and deeply held (T-1) 2.2.3.  The applicant's belief is  by virtue of religious training or other belief system akin  to religion; and (T-1) 2.2.4.  The applicant opposes participation in war in any form or the bearing of arms (T-1) 2.3.  Nature  of  Request.  The  applicant  must  set  out  the  exact  nature  of  the  request  --  that  is, whether  the  applicant  requests  separation  based  on  conscientious  objection  (1-O)  or  for assignment to noncombatant training and service based on conscientious objection (1-A-O). (T-1) 2.3.1.  Only  members  who  have  time  remaining  on  their  enlistment  contract  or  have  an Active  Duty  Service  Commitment  (ADSC)  for  officers  may  request  noncombatant  training and service (1-A-O). 2.3.2.  Members who do have time remaining on their enlistment contract or have an ADSC for  officers  may  request  CO  (1-O)  status  with  curtailment  of  ADSC  and  discharge  upon approval. 2.3.3.  Members with no remaining ADSCs or enlistment agreement at the time of their CO application must request CO (1-O) status with discharge upon approval. 2.4.  Applying for Noncombatant Training and Service.  The applicant will explain on his/her application  in  detail  what  benefit  his/her  continued  service  (to  include  new  duties  and responsibilities)  would  be  to  the  Air  Force.  Reviewing  officials  will  provide  recommendations on the validity of the applicant’s continued active duty service, so that final approving authorities can  make  a  determination  that  is  in  the  best  interest  of  the  Air  Force.    AFPC/DP3AM (Assignment  Policy)  and/or  AFPC/DP3ST  (Classifications)  may  be  consulted  by  the  final approving authority for further guidance to  validate retaining members.  If  noncombatant  duties cannot  be established or validated for  continued  active duty service, the  option to  discharge an 8 AFI36-3204  6 APRIL 2017 approved applicant under (1-O) CO status may be utilized by the final approving authority.  (T-1) 2.5.  Submitting Application.  A member of the Air Force who seeks either separation (1-O) or assignment to noncombatant duties (1-A-O) will: 2.5.1.  Include in the application a notation of the separation directive that applies: 2.5.1.1.  AFI 36-3207, Separating Commissioned Officers 2.5.1.2.

Include in the application any other information that the applicant desires to submit in support  of  the  case.  NOTE:  Members  who  have  departed  their  duty  station  for  Permanent Change  of  Station  (PCS)  reassignment  must  submit  their  application  at  their  next  duty station. 2.5.5.  Forward application according to Table 3.1. AFI36-3204  6 APRIL 2017 9 Chapter 3 INSTALLATION PROCESSING PROCEDURES 3.1.  General  Procedures.  Consistent  with  national  policy,  the  Air  Force  will  recognize members  who  qualify  as  bona  fide  conscientious  objectors  to  the  extent  practicable  and equitable.  The  Air  Force  does  not  recognize  objection  to  a  particular  war  as  grounds  for  CO status. 3.1.1.  Individual  facts  and  circumstances  of  each  case  will  be  the  determining  factor  for discharging a member as a CO prior to completion of an obligated term of service. The Air Force makes CO classification or restricts military duties of COs only to the extent that such classifications do not compromise Air Force effectiveness and efficiency. 3.1.1.1.  In  accordance  with  DoDI  1300.06,  Air  Force  members  who  had  CO  beliefs before  entering  military  service  are  not  eligible  for  CO  status  if  one  of  the  following circumstances apply: (T-1) 3.1.1.1.1.  Such  beliefs  satisfied  the  requirements  for  CO  classification  pursuant  to Section 6(j) of the Universal Military Training and Service Act, as amended (Title 50 U.S.C.  App  456(j))  and  other  provisions  of  law  at  the  time  the  member  entered  the service,  and  the  member  did  not  request  CO  classification  by  the  Selective  Service System (SSS) at that time. 3.1.1.1.2.  The  member  requested  CO  classification  before  entering  military  service, the  SSS  denied  the  request,  and  the  member's  request  for  classification  as  a  CO  is based on essentially the same grounds (or supported by essentially the same evidence) as the request that was denied by the SSS. 3.1.1.2.  Air  Force  members  who  had  CO  beliefs  before  entering  military  service  are eligible for CO status if both of the following circumstances apply: (T-1) 3.1.1.2.1.  The beliefs crystallized after receipt of an induction notice. 3.1.1.2.2.  The member could not request CO classification from the SSS because of SSS regulations prohibiting the submission of such requests after receipt of induction notice. 3.1.2.  Processing  personnel  must  not  use  this  instruction  instead  of  other  administrative separation  instructions  when  the  member  has  not  been  able  to  establish  CO  status  but separation appears to be in the best interest of the Air Force. 3.1.3.  Process any person classified as a 1-A-O CO for administrative separation under Air Force instructions when the circumstances warrant it. 3.1.4.  When  assigning  or  transferring  persons  classified  1-A-O  by  the  SSS  after  induction, transfer  1-A-Os  to  a  training  center  or  station  for  recruit  training  and  give  them noncombatant  training  and  service  duties.  These  inductees  sign  and  date  a  statement according to Attachment 3.   10 AFI36-3204  6 APRIL 2017 3.2.  Personnel Effects of CO Status Applications. 3.2.1.  Members who request CO status under this instruction are subject to the following: 3.2.1.1.  Enlisted  Airmen  awaiting  promotion  may  enter  withhold  status  (AFI  36-2502, Airmen Promotion/Demotion Programs). 3.2.1.2.  Officers  awaiting  promotion  to  all  grades  may  be  subject  to  delay  action  (AFI 36-2501,  Officer  Promotion  and  Selective  Continuation,  Chapter  5)  if  circumstances suggest  that  an  officer  may  not  be  suited  for  promotion  and  time  is  needed  to  develop more evidence on the question. 3.3.  Status of Applicant Whose Request Is Under Consideration. 3.3.1.  Commanders during the application processing period and before  a decision is  made by the applicable authority make every effort to assign applicants to duties that will conflict as little as possible with their asserted beliefs. (T-1) 3.3.2.  Applicants  will  conform  to  the  normal  requirements  of  military  service  and satisfactorily perform their assigned duties. (T-1) 3.3.3.  To the extent practicable under the circumstances, during the period  applications are being processed and until a decision is made, every effort will be made to assign applicants to duties that will conflict as little as possible with their asserted beliefs. Unless the Military Department  concerned  provides  otherwise,  an  applicant  shall  be  required  to  comply  with active  duty  or  transfer  orders  in  effect  at  the  time  of  his  or  her  application  or  subsequently issued and received.  During the period applications are being processed, applicants will be expected to conform to the normal requirement of military service and to perform such duties as  are  assigned.    Applicants  may  be  disciplined  for  violations  of  the  Uniform  Code  of Military Justice while awaiting action on their applications. 3.4.  Effect of Unauthorized Absence or Disciplinary/Administrative Action.  Commanders: 3.4.1.  Do  not  stop  processing  applications,  disciplinary  action,  or  administrative  separation actions because the applicant is absent without authorization. 3.4.2.  However, do not discharge an applicant whose request for CO classification has been approved until you resolve all disciplinary actions. (T-1) 3.5.  Making  Final  Determination  on  Applications.  Because  of  the  personal  and  subjective nature of conscientious objection (the existence, honesty, and sincerity of asserted conscientious objection),  commanders  must  not  apply  inflexible  standards.    Paragraph  5.1  lists  final  decision authorities. 3.6.  Returning  Applications  Without  Action.  The  commander  may  return  the  application without  action  if  a  member  submits  an  application  based  on  essentially  the  same  grounds  or supported by the same evidence as a previous application disapproved by SAFPC. 3.7.  MPS  Instructions.  Before processing the application, MPS/Career  Development  Element must:   AFI36-3204  6 APRIL 2017 11 3.7.1.  Inform  the  applicant  of  the  effects  of  being  discharged  as  a  CO  as  per  specific provisions of Title 38, U.S.C., Section 5303. NOTE: Title 38, U.S.C., Section 5303 provides, in  pertinent  part,  that  the  discharge  of  any  person  on  the  grounds  that  he  or  she  was  a  CO who refused to perform military duty or refused to wear the uniform or otherwise to comply with  lawful  orders  of  competent  military  authority,  shall  bar  all  rights  (except  certain government  insurance)  of  such  persons  under  law  administered  by  the  Department  of Veterans Affairs based on the period of service from which discharged (see Attachment 4).  This includes all medical, educational, and disability claim for benefits and any other benefits normally granted for satisfactory military service.   The only exception is in cases in which it is established, to the satisfaction of the Secretary of the Veterans Affairs, that the member is insane.  When a member is separated pursuant to a CO status, The Department of Veterans Affairs will determine what veterans benefits, if any, a member is entitled to receive. (T-0) 3.7.2.  The applicant must complete the statements shown in Attachment 3 and Attachment 4 (if applicant is requesting discharge, 1-O) or Attachment 4 and Attachment 5 (if applicant is requesting  noncombatant  status,  1-A-O).  The  MPS  must  forward  the  statements  with  the application. (T-1) 3.7.3.  Screen  the  applicant’s  personnel  record.    Review  the  applicant’s  entire  record  to include all recent personnel actions taken by the applicant or on behalf of the applicant and provide  this  information  to  the  investigating  officer.    Use  all  military  personnel  databases (e.g.,  Military  Personnel  Data  System  (MilPDS),  Case  Management  System  (CMS), Personnel Records Display Application (PRDA)) in the comprehensive review of the record. (T-1) 3.7.4.  Contact  other  sources  (the  unit  of  assignment,  AFPC/DP3AM  for  officers  of  the medical  services,  base,  installation  or  local  chaplain  corps  for  chaplains,  AF/JA  for  judge advocates)  for  any  information  that  may  support  or  cast  doubt  on  the  applicant’s  sincerity. These  sources  must  promptly  forward  information  for  inclusion  in  the  applicant’s  file  for consideration by the investigating officer. (T-1) 3.7.5.  Counsel applicant on the information in paragraph 3.1. (T-1) 3.7.6.  Schedule applicant for interviews with the chaplain and psychiatrist/psychologist. (T-1) 3.7.7.  Ensure commanders consider whether action under AFI 36-2502 (enlisted) or AFI 36-2501 (officer) is appropriate. (T-1) 3.8.  Reports  of  Interview.  If  the  applicant  refuses  to  participate  or  is  uncooperative  or unresponsive in the course of either interview below, include this fact in the report. 3.8.1.  Chaplain  Interview.  The  chaplain  will  ensure  the  applicant  is  made  aware  that  the conversation is not privileged and will be used in an official report. The chaplain will submit a  written  opinion  as  to  the  nature  and  basis  of  the  applicant’s  sincerity  and  depth  of conviction.  (T-1) 3.8.1.1.  The chaplain’s report must include the reasons for its conclusions. 3.8.1.2.  The report must not make any recommendations for approval or disapproval of the application. 12 AFI36-3204  6 APRIL 2017 3.8.2.  Psychiatrist Interview. The psychiatrist will submit a written report of the psychiatric evaluation, including discussion of any psychiatric disorder that would warrant treatment or disposition  through  medical  channels,  or  any  personality  disorder  that  would  warrant appropriate administrative action. (T-1) 3.8.2.1.  A  psychologist  may  conduct  this  evaluation  if  a  psychiatrist  is  not  reasonably available. 3.8.2.2.  The  psychiatrist  or  psychologist  will  not  make  any  recommendations  for approval or disapproval of the application. 3.9.  Furnishing  Case  File  to  Investigating  Officer.  MPS/Career  Development  Element includes  in  the  case  file  the  information  developed  in  the  screening  (paragraph  3.7.3.),  the chaplain’s  report,  and  the  psychiatric  evaluation  and  provides  the  case  file  to  the  investigating officer (see Chapter 4). 3.10.  Routing  the  Case  File.  Routing  and  review  procedures  for  the  applicant’s  case  file outlined below. 3.10.1.  The  MPS/Career  Development  Element  sends  the  case  file  to  the  local  staff  judge advocate (SJA) for review for procedural compliance within 15 calendar days after the date of the applicant’s request for a copy of the record or when the MPS receives the applicant’s rebuttal, whichever comes first. See paragraph 4.2.12 for the 15 days rule. 3.10.2.

Only through a complete investigation of  the  application  by  the  investigating  officer  are  reviewing  authorities  in  position  to judge the merits of the application. (T-1) 4.2.7.  The  applicant  may  submit  any  additional  evidence,  including  sworn  or  unsworn written statements, and present  any  witnesses on his/her behalf; applicant  is  responsible for their attendance. 4.2.7.1.

Final Decision Authorities. 5.1.1.  For officers: SAFPC makes the decision regarding CO status. 5.1.2.  For  enlisted:  The  final  approval  decision  is  made  by  AFPC/DP2ST  (active  duty enlisted  airmen),  NGB/CF  (ANG  enlisted  airmen),  AFRC/CV  (Air  Force  Reserve  Unit Program – Cat A), and ARPC/CV (Air Force Reserve IR Program – IMA and PIRR) 5.1.3.  SAFPC is the disapproval authority for all enlisted. 5.1.4.  Decision authorities do not grant noncombatant status (1-A-O) as a compromise to an applicant claiming CO (1-O) status. 5.2.  Justification for Approval  . 5.2.1.  To  approve  a  conscientious  objection  (1-O)  classification  the  reviewing  authorities must find that an applicant's moral and ethical beliefs oppose participation in war in any form and that the applicant holds these beliefs with the strength of traditional religious convictions. (T-1) 5.2.2.  To  approve  an  assignment  to  noncombatant  training  and  service  based  on conscientious objection (1-A-O) the reviewing authorities must find that an applicant’s moral and  ethical  beliefs  objects  to  participation  as  a  combatant  in  war  in  any  form,  but  whose convictions are such as to permit military service in a non-combatant stratus. (T-1) 5.2.3.  For  either  classification,  the  applicant  must  show  that  these  moral  and  ethical convictions, once acquired, have directed the applicant's life in the way traditional religious convictions  of  equal  strength,  depth,  and  duration  direct  the  lives  of  those  who  have  such beliefs. In other words, conscientious objection must be the primary controlling force in the applicant's life. (T-1) 5.2.4.  A  primary  factor  is  the  sincerity  with  which  the  applicant  holds  the  belief.  Exercise great care in determining whether the applicant honestly and genuinely holds asserted beliefs. 5.2.4.1.  Determine  sincerity  by  evaluating  the  applicant's  thinking  and  life  style  in  its totality, past and present. 5.2.4.2.  Information  the  applicant  presents  should  clearly  establish  that  avoidance  of military service is not the basis of the claim. 5.2.5.  In evaluating applications, carefully examine and weigh the conduct of applicants, in particular their outward manifestation of their beliefs. 5.2.6.  Consider the following relevant factors: 5.2.6.1.  Training in the home and place of worship. 5.2.6.2.  General demeanor and pattern of conduct. 5.2.6.3.  Participation in religious activities or other belief system activities. 18 AFI36-3204  6 APRIL 2017 5.2.6.4.  Whether  the  applicant  gained  ethical  or  moral  convictions  through  training, study, contemplation, or other activity comparable in rigor and dedication to formulating traditional religious convictions. 5.2.6.5.  Credibility of the applicant. 5.2.6.6.  Credibility of persons supporting the claim. 5.2.7.  Be  particularly  careful  not  to  rule  out  bona  fide  beliefs  simply  because  those  beliefs are incompatible with one's own. 5.2.7.1.  It  is  not  necessary  that  an  applicant  belong  to  a  church  or  adhere  to  particular theological  tenets  for  the  Air  Force  to  grant  separation  or  assignment  to  noncombatant training and service. 5.2.7.2.  The  applicant’s  affiliation  with  a  church  or  other  group  that  advocates conscientious  objection  as  a  tenet  of  its  creed  is  not  necessarily  conclusive  of  an applicant’s position or belief. 5.2.7.3.  Conversely,  if  an  applicant  is  affiliated  with  a  church  or  group  that  does  not teach conscientious objection such affiliation does not necessarily rule out an applicant’s adherence to conscientious objection beliefs. 5.2.8.  Where  an  applicant  is  or  has  been  a  member  of  a  church,  religious  organization,  or religious  sect,  and  where  applicant’s  claim  of  conscientious  objection  is  related  to  the membership and the teachings of the church, religious organization, or religious sect, as well as the applicant’s religious activity may be considered. 5.2.8.1.  However, the fact that the applicant may disagree with, or not subscribe to, some of the tenets of applicant’s church does not necessarily discredit applicant’s claim. 5.2.8.2.  The personal convictions of each member are controlling so long as they derive from moral, ethical, or religious beliefs. 5.2.9.  Do  not  deny  an  applicant  who  is  otherwise  eligible  for  CO  status  simply  because conscientious objection beliefs influence his or her views on domestic or foreign policy. The task is to decide whether the applicant sincerely  holds the beliefs, and whether they govern the applicant’s actions both in word and deed. AFI36-3204  6 APRIL 2017 19 Chapter 6 FINAL DISPOSITION 6.1.  Discharging  the  Member.  Members determined to  be COs (1-O or 1-A-O where  further service  is  not  desired  by  the  Air  Force)  will  be  processed  for  discharge  according  to  the applicable  AFI.    This  is  a  convenience  of  the  government  discharge.  The  Air  Force  goal  is  to discharge  COs  (1-O  or  1-A-O  where  further  service  is  not  desired  by  the  Air  Force)  within10 duty days of the approval of the member’s application. Pending separation: 6.1.1.  The  applicant  continues  to  perform  duties  that  conflict  as  little  as  possible  with professed  beliefs,  conform  to  the  normal  requirements  of  military  service  and  satisfactorily perform assigned duties. 6.1.2.  Disciplinary  authorities  handle  violations  of  the  UCMJ  by  these  members  as  in  any other situation 6.2.  Noncombatant Status (1-A-O). 6.2.1.  When applicant is granted noncombatant status he/she is either: 6.2.1.1.  Assigned to noncombatant duty, or 6.2.1.2.  Discharged from military service in accordance with Air Force policy. 6.2.2.  Noncombatant duty will only be performed for the remainder of the term of enlistment (for  enlisted)  or  the  remainder  of  the  furthest  ADSC  date  at  the  time  the  CO  application  is submitted (for officers). AFPC/DP2ST updates the Date of Separation (DOS) and members separate  as  a  CO  upon  completion  of  their  term  of  enlistment  or  ADSC.    Approved  CO noncombatants will not  be allowed to extend their term of service or accumulate additional ADSCs past their established DOS.   (T-1) 6.2.3.  Assignment  Limitation.  Upon  approval  of  individuals  for  noncombatant  service, AFPC/DP2ST will ensure that all appropriate assignment limitation and/or availability codes are updated into the MilPDS. 6.2.4.  If the approved CO noncombatant is serving in an overseas location, the member may be reassigned to a CONUS location to serve out the remaining term of enlistment or ADSC to  perform  noncombatant  duties  until  separation  from  the  service.  The  determination  for assignment actions will be made by AFPC/DP3AM.  (T-1) 6.2.5.  COs  assigned  to  noncombatant  duties  must  conform  to  the  normal  requirements  of military service and satisfactorily perform their assigned duties. 6.2.6.  Disciplinary  authorities  handle  violations  of  the  UCMJ  by  these  members  as  in  any other situation.     20 AFI36-3204  6 APRIL 2017 6.3.  Disapproved Applicant. 6.3.1.  Members  assigned  to  normal  military  duties  because  of  disapproval  of  their application  must  conform  to  the  normal  requirements  of  military  service  and  satisfactorily perform their assigned duties. 6.3.2.  Disciplinary  authorities  handle  violations  of  the  UCMJ  by  these  members  as  in  any other situation. 6.3.3.  The applicant is entitled to know why the Air Force rejected his/her CO request.  The rationale behind a CO rejection must be part of the record. 6.4.  Notifying  Selective  Service  When  a  CO  Member  Has  Not  Completed  180  Days  of Active  Duty.  During  conscription,  discharge  bona  fide  CO  (1-O  classification  or  1-A-O,  with directed discharge) with less than 180 days service, is early enough to permit them to serve their remaining  service time in the civilian work program  administered by Selective Service System (SSS). 6.4.1.  The  MPS/Career  Development  Element  promptly  notifies  the  SSS  of  the  date  of discharge from military service and of the fact that the individual has not completed 180 days of active duty. 6.4.2.  The  MPS/Career  Development  Element  prepares  the  discharge  notification  for  the immediate  commander’s  signature  and  sends  it  to  the  Director  of  the  SSS,  National Headquarters, Selective Service System, Washington DC 20435.

Conscientious  Objector  (CO)—Class  1-O.  A  member  who,  by  reason  of  conscientious objection,  sincerely  objects  to  participation  in  military  service  of  any  kind  in  war  in  any  form. Class  1-A-O.  A  member  who,  by  reason  of  conscientious  objection,  sincerely  objects  to participation  as  a  combatant  in  war  in  any  form,  but  whose  convictions  are  such  as  to  permit military service in a noncombatant status. National Policy—Military service is a patriotic obligation of every citizen who desires to share in  the  benefits  and  protections  afforded  by  allegiance  to  the  national  aims,  objectives,  welfare, and security of the US  government. Congress  established the Armed Forces to ensure attaining these objectives by preserving peace and national stability in a highly competitive and changing world.  Nevertheless,  Congress  has  recognized  that  deep  and  sincerely  held  convictions  against the use of force may place any citizen in a dilemma between conscience and patriotic obligation. Therefore,  Congress  provided  a  means  whereby  these  citizens  may  be  excused  or  restricted  in duties from their military obligation by receiving status as COs. Noncombatant Duties or Service—1) Service in any unit of the Armed Forces that is unarmed at all times. 2) Any other assignment the primary function of which does not require the use of arms  in  combat  provided  that  such  other  assignment  is  acceptable  to  the  individual  concerned and does not require him or her to bear arms or to be trained in their use.  3) Service aboard an armed ship or aircraft or in a combat zone shall be considered to be non-combatant duty unless the  individual  concerned  is  personally  and  directly  involved  in  the  operation  of  weapons.  NOTE:  Used interchangeably throughout the document. Noncombatant Training—Any training that is not concerned with the study, use, or handling of weapons. Religious Training and Belief—Belief in an external power or "being" or deeply held moral or ethical belief, to which all else is subordinate or upon which all else is ultimately dependent, and which has the power or force to affect moral well-being. The external power or "being" need not be  one  that  has  found  expression  in  either  religious  or  societal  traditions.  However,  it  should AFI36-3204  6 APRIL 2017 23 sincerely occupy a place of equal or greater value in the life of its possessor. Deeply held moral or  ethical  beliefs  should  be  valued  with  the  strength  and  devotion  of  traditional  religious conviction.    The  term  "religious  training  and/or  belief"  may  include  solely  moral  or  ethical beliefs  even  though  the  applicant  may  not  characterize  these  beliefs  as  "'religious"  in  the traditional  sense,  or  may  expressly  characterize  them  as  not  religious.  The  term  "religious training  and/or belief" does not  include  a belief  that rests solely upon  considerations of policy, pragmatism, expediency, or political views. War in Any Form—All warfare--those wars waged in the past, present, and future that include combatant  forces.  The  Air  Force  does  not  consider  members  who  believe  they  can  choose  the war in which they will participate as COs under the law. The objection must be to all wars rather than to a specific war. A belief in a theocratic or spiritual war between the powers of good and evil does not constitute a willingness to participate in war within the meaning of this instruction.  24 AFI36-3204  6 APRIL 2017 Attachment 2 REQUIRED INFORMATION TO BE SUPPLIED BY APPLICANT FOR DISCHARGE OR NONCOMBATANT SERVICE A2.1.

A2.2.2.
