Definition. In accordance with the DoDD 5000.52, Key Leadership Positions (KLPs) are a  subset  of  Critical  Acquisition  Positions  (CAPs).    KLPs  include  positions  that  require special  Office  of  the  Under  Secretary  of  Defense  (Acquisition,  Technology  and  Logistics) (OUSD  (AT&L))  and  Service  Acquisition  Executive  (SAE)  attention  with  regard  to qualifications,  accountability,  and incumbents  have  direct responsibility  for, and direct influence on, the success of an acquisition program, acquisition system, or major  technical area of responsibility. 1.2.  Purpose.  The purpose of this AFI is to implement DoDD 5000.52 and provide guidance for  managing  KLPs.    This  instruction  also  describes  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  the SAE,  Program  Executive  Officers  (PEO),  Major  Commands  (MAJCOMs),  Air  Force Personnel  Assignment/Employment Teams,  and other  participants  in  the  assignments  to  and management of KLPs.   1.3.  KLP Position Designation. KLPs are designated by the responsible SAE.   In  general,  KLP 1.3.1.  The Air  Force  Director, Acquisition Career Management  (DACM) assists the SAE regarding  KLP  policy  and  management. 1.3.2.  The following are mandatory KLP positions: 1.3.2.1.  Program Executive Officers (PEOs). 1.3.2.2.  Deputy Program Executive Officers (DPEOs). 1.3.2.3.  Senior Contracting Officials (SCOs) – (Air Staff/MAJCOM Level). 1.3.2.4.  Senior Center Contracting Officials (SCCOs). 1.3.2.5.  Other positions identified by the SAE. 1.3.3.  All  positions  listed  below  are  designated  as  mandatory  KLPs  for  ACAT  I  and  IA programs.    These  positions  may  be  associated  exclusively  with  a  single  program  or  be shared across multiple programs: 1.3.3.1.  Program Managers (PMs). 1.3.3.2.  Deputy Program Managers (DPMs). 1.3.3.3.  Chief Engineer/Lead Systems Engineer (Program Lead, Engineer). 1.3.3.4.  Product Support Manager (Program Lead, Logistician). 1.3.3.5.  Chief Developmental Tester (Program Lead, T&E). 1.3.3.6.  Program Lead, Business Financial Manager. 1.3.4.  The following functional lead positions will be designated as KLPs for ACAT I and IA  programs  as  necessary  when  the  function  is  required  based  on  the  phase  or  type  of acquisition  program.    These  lead  positions  may  be  associated  exclusively  with  a  single program or be shared across multiple programs: 1.3.4.1.  Program Lead, Contracting Officer. 1.3.4.2.  Program Lead, Cost Estimator. 1.3.4.3.  Program Lead, Production, Quality, and Manufacturing. 1.3.4.4.  Program Lead, Information Technology.  1.3.5.  Program Managers for ACAT II programs are designated as mandatory KLPs. 1.4.  KLP  Nominations.    Air  Force  PEOs  and  MAJCOM/A1s  will  work  together  to  recommend program  KLPs  for  designation  by  the  SAE,  based  on  their  assessment  of  Major  Defense Acquisition  Program  (MDAP)  and  Major  Automated  Information  System  (MAIS)  program requirements and the particular needs of their portfolio as a whole, consistent with section 1.3.  Recommendations will specify which position, and for which functional categories within the PEO  portfolio.    If  a  program  doesn’t  merit  full  time  support  by  a  functional  lead  or  cannot identify a needed KLP qualified functional lead, designated functional leads may be matrixed to a program or multiple programs from other organizations (e.g. Center or PEO Staff, functional home office, or another program office) except as otherwise required by statute or regulation.  In accordance with DoD and Air Force coding guidance, positions will be aligned to a single function.    Recommendations  for  KLP  designation  should  be  staffed  through  the  Director  of Acquisition Career Management (SAF/AQH) to the SAE for approval. 1.4.1.  The SAE will approve selection of PEO, Deputy PEO, ACAT I/IA PM, ACAT I/IA Deputy PM, and ACAT II PMs considering program factors, individual qualifications and the program management functional requirements. 1.4.2.  For all other KLPs covered in this AFI that are not identified in para 1.4.1, the hiring authority  retains  final  selection  approval  authority;  however,  any  tailoring  of  tenure  or waiver of the requirements, including functional specific requirements, requires approval by the SAE. (See also 1.7 Waivers). 1.4.3.  MAJCOMS will ensure SAE approved KLPs are coded correctly in the appropriate manpower and personnel systems.  In addition, owning units will identify the position as a KLP in the civilian Position Description (PD). 1.4.4.    Commands  may  request  SAE  designation  of  additional  KLPs  for  leadership positions at the GS-15 (or equivalent) and O-6 level or above. 1.5.  Assignment Qualifications. To be assigned to a KLP, candidates need to meet specific criteria;  positions  must  filled  by  O-5/O-6  military  personnel  or  GS-14/15  (or  equivalent) civilian personnel, or higher.  Candidates need to meet DoD position qualification requirements or be able to attain them within the time frame allowed by statute and DoD policy.  The current DoD qualifications can be found on the Statutory Position Requirements page of the Air Force Portal’s Acquisition site.  To aid in evaluating and selecting the best qualified KLP candidates, five factors have been identified as requirements essential for selection and are summarized in Attachment  2.    Additional  functional  specific  requirements  and  preferences  for  KLPs  are located  at  http://icatalog.dau.mil/onlinecatalog/CareerLvl.aspx.    These  requirements  will  be updated on an annual basis by the functional leader for the individual career field. 1.6.  Tenure. Individuals  assigned  to  KLPs  are  required  to  remain  in  the  respective  position for  the  tenure  period  specified  by  the  SAE.    The  gaining  organization  must  ensure civilian  hires sign  a  tenure  agreement (DD Form 2889)  reflecting  the tenure period.  (See also  1.7  Waivers).    Military  members  sign  the  Active  Duty  Service  Commitment  (ADSC) agreement rather than a tenure agreement. 1.6.1.  The SAE will approve selection and set the tenure of PEO, Deputy PEO, ACAT I/IA PM, ACAT I/IA Deputy PM, and ACAT II PMs considering program factors, individual qualifications  and  the  program  management  functional  requirements.    Unless  otherwise specified by the SAE, the tenure period for a KLP is three years.  For ACAT I PMs/DPMs the tenure is 4 years or through the milestone closest to 4 years. 1.6.2.  For all other positions designated by the SAE as KLPs, the hiring authority retains final  selection  approval  authority;  however,  any  tailoring  of  tenure  or  waiver  of  the requirements, including functional specific requirements, requires approval by the SAE.   1.6.3.  For military personnel, the ADSC and assignment availability code will be adjusted to correspond with the tenure completion date.  A selectee is not eligible for appointment to, and an incumbent is not eligible to retain employment in, a KLP if they decline to accept the ADSC. 1.6.4.  The  gaining  organization  is  responsible  for  executing  the  tenure  agreement  and forwarding  the  tenure  agreement  to  the  servicing  C i v i l i a n   Personnel  Office  for inclusion  into  the  respective  civilian  personnel  system  and  official  personnel  records consistent with  paragraph  1.8.7.2.   A  selectee  is  not  eligible  for  appointment  to,  and  an incumbent is  not eligible to retain employment in, a KLP if they decline to sign the tenure agreement. 1.6.5.  Tenure  Agreements  (DD  Form  2889),  CAP  Service  Agreement  KLP  is  used  to document  the  KLP  tenure  agreement.    The tenure agreement for  all  other CAPs  will  be documented on DD Form 2888  and is not to be used for KLPs. 1.7.  Waivers.  If  circumstances  necessitate,  the  MAJCOM/CCs  or  PEOs  may  request  the responsible SAE approve a Position Requirements Waiver or a Tenure Waiver. 1.7.1.  If  a  KLP  candidate  does  not  meet  the  minimum  position  requirements,  a  Position Requirements Waiver (DD Form 2905) request needs to accompany the proposed selection.  The gaining organization specifies the target date by which the individual is expected to meet the  position  requirements.    Follow  MAJCOM  and/or  Center  coordination  instructions  to route  the  request  via  the  appropriate  Air  Staff  Functional  Manager’s  Office  through  the DACM to the SAE for approval.  Individuals who fail to meet the KLP requirements within 6  months  of  accepting  the  KLP  or  as  defined  on  the  training  plan  documented  on  their position requirements waiver, may be removed from the KLP by the SAE.  1.7.2.  If  warranted,  the  SAE  may  approve  a  waiver  of  the  tenure  duration  to  release an individual from the tenure agreement.   MAJCOM/CCs and PEOs  m u s t   explain why release  from  statutory  position  tenure  is  in  the  best  interests  of  the  Air  Force  or  DoD.  Follow  MAJCOM  and/or  Center  coordination  instructions  to  route  the  request  via  the appropriate  Air  Staff  Functional  Manager’s  Office  through  the  DACM  to  the  responsible SAE for approval. 1.7.3.  Waivers  are  formally  requested  on  DD  Form  2905,  "AT&L  Workforce  Position Requirements or Tenure Waiver," which is generated using the ACQ Now AT&L Workforce Waiver System. 1.7.4.
