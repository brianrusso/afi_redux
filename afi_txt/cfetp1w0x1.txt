Continuous training and timely progression from the apprentice to the Chief Enlisted Manager levels are vital to the Air Force's ability to accomplish its mission.  All personnel involved in training must do their part to plan, manage, and conduct an effective training program.  This section explains how enlisted weather personnel typically expand their responsibilities, receive training at appropriate points in their career, and progress to each skill level.  Section C lists specific mandatory requirements for upgrade.  5.1. Apprentice, 3-Skill Level.  Individuals are awarded a 3-skill level upon completion of the Initial Skills Course (ISC), Weather Apprentice Course, at Keesler AFB, MS.  Apprentices work directly with a qualified trainer(s) to enhance task skills and knowledge. Trainers and supervisors use standardized training plans, Occupational UGT (consists of material on AFWOP) & positional qualification training (consists of the STS, WTSs, CDCs, and local Master Task listing) to systematically train newly assigned apprentices.    The primary task of apprentices is to complete their occupational UGT, position qualification and skill-level upgrade training to become certified to work as Journeymen in designated positions at an OWS, Weather Squadron (WS), Weather Flight (WF) or Detachment (Det). Improving and understanding their craft in observing, forecasting, briefings, and resource protection is their primary focus areas.  Trainees, trainers/supervisors, and flight leadership provide feedback as directed following guidance located on the Air Force Weather Portal and in AFI 36-2201 and AFI 15-127, Weather Training.  All ANG 1W031 personnel must complete ANGWRTC 010 (Weather Applications Course) immediately following the ISC for qualification and UGT before award of 5-Skill level.  If assigned to unit providing Army weather support, all Airmen regardless of rank or skill level must attend the AWSC and ECAC IAW according to AFI 15-127.  After apprentices have been certified through a position qualification, they may perform tasks and work the duty position without direct supervision while obtaining the 12- month time requirement for upgrade IAW according to AFI 36-2201.    5.2. Journeyman, 5-Skill Level.  Journeymen are typically assigned to WFs/Det/space environment sites, OWSs, and instructor duty.  They perform a wide range of duties depending on unit of assignment.  Journeymen begin to serve as trainers and supervisors in addition to performing the technical tasks of the career field.  Journeymen exploit training opportunities and  10   continue to refine their technical skills.  They participate in Continuation Training programs to broaden their technical expertise and will complete Airman Leadership School prior to assuming the grade of SSgt.  Journeymen should strive to complete the academic requirements for a CCAF Associate Degree in Operational Meteorology.   Journeymen enter into 7-skill level upgrade on the first day of the promotion cycle following their selection for SSgt.  (Reserve Component Journeymen enter into 7-skill level upgrade status upon assuming the grade of SSgt).  5.3. Craftsman, 7-Skill Level.  After successful upgrade to the 7-level, Craftsmen assume increasing supervisory and management responsibilities in addition to performing the technical tasks of the career field.  They may be assigned worldwide to any organizational level, to include MAJCOM and higher headquarters staff positions.  They provide technical leadership to subordinates and ensure they meet Air Force standards.  They manage and adapt the use of weather resources to meet mission requirements.  Craftsmen schedule personnel for routine duties, severe weather duties, mission standby, and training.  They assume a vital mentorship responsibility and provide a clear vision of career choices and progression to enlisted weather personnel.  Craftsmen increase technical expertise through job experience, formal courses, OJT and online training.  Craftsmen complete formal continuation training courses as needed to perform their duties.  When selected for promotion to TSgt, Craftsmen are eligible to attend the NCO Academy. To enroll in SNCO DLC the craftsmen must have a line number or already be a MSgt.  TSgts with a line number to MSgt and MSgts are eligible to perform duties at the HAF Staff, MAJCOM staff, Wing Staff, Group Staff or as WS/OWS/WF Flight Chief after they have received the applicable Vector from the DDB and attended the AWMC course.  Upon completion of this course they receive a Special Experience Identifier (SEI 755).  MSgts must complete Phase 3 EPME DL (Enlisted PME Distance Learning).  In residence SNCOA is not required for SMSgt (AFI 36-2301) before assuming the grade of SMSgt.  The Senior Enlisted Joint PME I course and continued academic education through CCAF and civilian institutions is encouraged.  5.4. Superintendent, 9-Skill Level.  Upon promotion to SMSgt, individuals are eligible for upgrade to the 9-skill level and may fill a Superintendent position.  Superintendents perform a broad range of supervisory and management duties and may be assigned worldwide to large base-level organizations and to MAJCOM and higher headquarters staff positions.  They provide leadership, technical oversight and functional management, and supervise Craftsmen and Journeymen.  They formulate and apply tactics, techniques and procedures to exploit unit capabilities, and they communicate those capabilities to supported customers.  They interact with other senior NCOs and represent their organization to base agencies.  They acquire and manage resources, and adapt operations to meet mission requirements.  They oversee the scheduling of personnel, operations, and facilities.  They develop leadership and management skills in subordinate personnel, and ensure compliance with AF standards.  Superintendents assume a vital mentorship responsibility, train subordinates in the art of mentorship, and provide a clear vision of career choices and progression to enlisted personnel.  Superintendents assigned to MAJCOMs and higher organizations manage programs to ensure current and future capability to meet Air Force and DoD requirements.  Superintendents increase their expertise through job experience and by utilizing all available training resources.  They develop skills that contribute to effective coordination, allocation of resources and tailoring of weather operations to meet mission requirements.  Courses in areas such as budget, manpower, resources, information technology, and personnel management are useful.  Senior Enlisted Joint Professional Military Education II Course, and Joint Force Operations courses will greatly expand a superintendent’s ability to lead and manage their operations.  Additional higher education is encouraged.  They  11   may serve at the Air Staff , MAJCOM, Wing, Group, Squadron, Weather Flight or Det depending on vector from the DDB.  5.5. Weather Chief Master Sergeant.  The Weather Manager code (1W000) is awarded upon promotion to CMSgt.  AFSCs 1W0X1 and 1W0X2 merge at the CMSgt level.  For award of AFSC 1W000, qualification in and possession of AFSC 1W091 or 1W092 is mandatory.  Chiefs may be assigned worldwide to the Air Staff CFM position, MFM, Wing, Group or Squadron positions.  Chiefs must be well versed in scheduling personnel, providing technical and enlisted force structure leadership, mentorship, training, tailoring unit capabilities, and managing weather resources to meet mission requirements. Chiefs lead the enlisted force, develop policy and procedures, and manage programs and resources to ensure weather operations meet current and future mission requirements.  They perform staff duties as Functional or Operations Managers.  Chiefs provide technical and operational leadership, and advise senior officers on the development and utilization of the enlisted force.  They supervise Superintendents and Craftsmen, counsel and mentor subordinates, and provide a clear vision of career choices and progression to enlisted weather personnel.  They develop leadership, management, and mentorship skills in subordinates.  They interact with other CMSgts and represent their organization and career field to everyone they come into contact with.  Upon selection to CMSgt, they attend a CMSgt Orientation seminar conducted by MAJCOM and the Air Force Chief Master Sergeant Academy (CMSA).  These seminars provide broad knowledge of personnel management, assignments, manpower, budget, and other Air Force processes.  Chiefs increase their expertise through job experience, interaction with other CEMs, and by utilizing all available training resources.  They are expected to take the initiative to obtain needed training, for example, Staff Officer courses, organizational seminars, computer-based training and distance learning.  Additional higher education is encouraged.  6. Training Decisions.  The CFETP uses a building block approach (simple to complex) to encompass the entire spectrum of training requirements for the Weather career field.  The spectrum includes a strategy for when, where, and how to meet the training requirements.  The strategy must be apparent and affordable to reduce duplication of training and eliminate a disjointed approach to training.  The U & TW held 22 Jul – 24 Jul 14, at Keesler AFB, MS, made the decisions contained within this CFETP.  Key decisions in the latest U&TW were to create the AWMC for Craftsmen vectored to a Flight Chief position, to restructure the Tropical Forecasting course to add more instructor-student interaction, and to add 10 days to the ISC and include more training on observing, briefing, and forecast lab.  Additionally, the MAJCOM FMs and the CFM participated in an Army Critical Task Site Selection Board (CTSSB) in Aug 2015 and restructured the AWSC from the legacy BWC.  Copies of the minutes can be obtained from a MAJCOM FM or the AFCFM.  7. Community College of the Air Force (CCAF).  This program provides the opportunity to earn an Associate Degree in Operational Meteorology.  CCAF automatically enrolls BMT graduates entering the weather career field in this program.  Refer to the CCAF Handbook and Guidance at http://www.au.af.mil/au/ccaf/publications.asp for the latest information on requirements.  In addition to its Associate Degree program, CCAF offers the following:  7.1. CCAF Instructor Certification (CIC).  For qualified instructors who teach CCAF collegiate-level credit-awarding courses at a CCAF affiliated school.  The CIC program is a three-level program consisting of three specific levels of achievement.  Once an instructor leaves CCAF  12 Semester Hours 24 6 4 15 15 64  Technical Education; Leadership, Management, and Military Studies; or General Education  instructor duty, they are no longer eligible for the CIC.  To obtain more information, refer to the CCAF Campus Affiliations Policies and Procedures Guidelines.  7.2. Trade Skill Certification.  When CCAF students separate or retire, a trade skill certification is awarded for their primary occupational specialty.  CCAF uses a competency-based assessment process for trade skill certification at one of four proficiency levels: apprentice, journeyman, craftsman/supervisor, or master craftsman/manager.  All are transcribed on the CCAF transcript.  7.3. Degree Requirements.  The Operational Meteorology degree program (8FYY) applies to the 1W0XX AFSCs.

Additional off-duty education is a personal choice encouraged for all.  Individuals desiring to become an AETC Instructor should be actively pursuing an Associate Degree.  A degreed faculty is necessary to maintain accreditation through the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.  13    7.5. Aeronautical Meteorological Forecaster (AMF) Certification.  To obtain this optional certification an Air Force Weather Airman must meet the same requirements outlined in 15WX Weather Officer CFETP.  Because this certification is optional, it is not be a factor in determining an enlisted Airmen’s suitability to hold a skill level within the weather AFSC.  7.6. Professional Manager Certification Program (PMC).  CCAF offers the PMC to qualified enlisted members.  The PMC is a professional credential that formally recognizes an individual’s advanced level of education and experience in leadership and management, as well as professional accomplishments.  This program provides a structured professional development track that supplements PME and CFETP.  Enlisted Airmen who meet all program requirements are eligible.  For information, visit https://augateway.maxwell.af.mil/ccaf/certifications/pmc/.   7.7. Professional Affiliations and Fraternal Organizations.  The Air Force recognizes the importance and supports associations with professional organizations as a vital tool in continuing education and professional development.  Such affiliations offer tangible benefits in areas of leadership, networking, team-building, communication, community service and most of all career enhancement.  Some examples related to the Weather career field are the American Meteorology Association, the Air Weather Association and the Gray Beret Association.  7.8. Certification:  Airmen who complete 3-level ISC, post initial skills course upgrade training and are positional qualified are unit-certified filling the position requirements in Weather Operations. Additional training is required for Army support units for CMR/MR qualification.    14  8. Career Path.  8.1. Enlisted Weather Career Progression.    8.2. The 1W Deliberate Development Board (DDB) will balance career growth opportunities, AF needs, and individual preferences while focusing on developing MSgts and SMSgts for increased (or higher) leadership positions in the Weather Career Fields.  It is aimed at improving the identification of the right Airmen, for the right job, at the right time.  The Functional Area Counsel (FAC) will review positions and tie them to the Tier structure (and the applicable SEI of 1CA through 1CF).  All positions will be reevaluated annually.  The DDB will also evaluate Senior NCOs and will vector them towards key leadership and developmental positions within the 1W career fields on a quarterly basis to update SNCO SEI eligibility.  SNCOs can request a review and update of their vectors at these quarterly events.  Vectors are a DDB’s collective recommendation for assignment by the FAC based on records review, experience level, training and/or education, adherence to Air Force Standards and/or position type that a member should be considered for in their next or subsequent assignment or developmental opportunity.  These vectors identify a member’s eligibility to fill a position; they do constitute an actual position or assignment match.  SNCOs serving in a DDB position will be identified with a specified duty title and fill a D-prefix position as defined on the UMD.    8.2.1. Vectors awarded to MSgts are:   8.2.1.1. Flt Chief – (Tier III, SEI 1CF) is awarded to all MSgts who have an established history of meeting quality force indicator standards.   15    8.2.1.2.

Section E – Transition Training Guide    12. There are currently no transition training requirements.  This area is reserved.    20   Part II  Section A - Specialty Training Standard (STS)  1. Implementation.    1.1. The STS lists subject areas, tasks and training references, and outlines proficiency requirements for training provided by other agencies (AFSOC and Army) as identified in Column 4.    1.2. The STS is also a guide for development of promotion tests used in the Weighted Airman Promotion System (WAPS).  Specialty Knowledge Tests (SKT) are developed at the USAF Occupational Measurement Squadron by Senior NCOs with extensive practical experience in their career fields.  The tests sample knowledge of STS subject areas judged by test development team members as most appropriate for promotion to higher grades.  WAPS is not applicable to the Air National Guard.  1.3. When removed from the CFETP and placed in an individual’s OJT records, serves as a Job Qualification Standard (JQS).  An AFJQS may be used in lieu of the CFETP Part II upon approval of the AFCFM.  A Command or Army Support JQS may be used in addition to the CFETP Part II upon coordination/approval with the AFCFM.  2.  Purpose.  As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, the STS:  2.1. Lists in Column 1 (Tasks, Knowledge, Equipment, and Technical References) the most common tasks, knowledge, equipment, and technical references (TR) necessary for Airmen to perform duties at the 3-, 5-, and 7-skill levels in the weather career field.  It identifies the source(s) of training or information for each task and knowledge training requirement.  2.2. Lists in Column 2 (Core Tasks), using a number corresponding to the skill level, the minimum qualification requirement for everyone in the AFS, regardless of duty position.  Proficiency in core tasks is a basic requirement for success in the 1W AFS.  Individuals will be certified in all core tasks prior to award of the 5-skill level (7-skill level when applicable).  The core tasks requiring equipment will be certified using the equipment available at the duty location.  Column 2 (UTC) identifies the tasks required for recertification when individual is supporting the specified UTC.  2.3. Column 3 (OJT Task Certification) is used to record completion of tasks and knowledge training requirements as specified in AFI 36-2201 or procedures in the electronic/automated training system.  Task certifier initials are required for core tasks.  (NOTE:  Supervisors are mandated to use electronic/automated training record (AFTR) rather than paper records.  Training systems must include the information, and conform to the training requirements, contained in the STS, or may be electronically linked to the STS.  Training systems must be capable of producing exportable electronic data or paper output to facilitate the transfer of training records to gaining units.)  2.4. Column 4 (Proficiency Codes) shows the knowledge and proficiency to be demonstrated by the trainee as a result of in-residence initial skills technical training, and CDCs.  Also, identifies  21   proficiency required for selected courses owned by other agencies/MAJCOMs and Army support.   2.4.1. AWSC: AWSC is not a skill level upgrade training course, but rather a course to provide Airmen assigned to Army units with similar combat survival skills to their Army counterparts to enable them to perform their mission in a battlefield environment alongside the Soldiers they support.  The course is managed by the Army Training and Doctrine Command with input from the AFCFM and Army Forces Command.  The training is based on the Soldiers Manual of Common Tasks, Level 1 Warrior Skills and approved by AETC  2.4.1.1. Soldiers Manual of Common Tasks Warrior Skills Level 1.  The SMCT is an Army manual containing the warrior skills that all Soldiers must be able to perform and information on how to perform and evaluate the tasks.  Airmen assigned to Army support units must also maintain proficiency in the STS referenced common Soldier skills.  The SMCT is a tool that can be used by supervisors and commanders performing Army support to maintain proficiency in the common Soldier skills after initial training at AWSC.     2.4.2. AWMC:  designed to teach MSgts advanced leadership skills to manage weather operations and lead Airmen in performing their weather duties.  MSgt and MSgt selects are selected for this course based on selection by the Enlisted Developmental Team.  Certain positions can only be filled by SNCOs who have completed this training.  2.4.3. Qualitative Requirements.  Attachment 1 of the STS contains the Proficiency Code Key used to indicate the level of training and knowledge taught by in-residence schools and CDCs.  3. Recommending Changes or Improvements.  Recommendations, comments, and improvements are invited concerning the quality of AETC Training. A Customer Service Information Line (CSIL) has been installed for the supervisors’ convenience. For a quick response to concerns call our CSIL at DSN 597-4566, or fax us at DSN 597-3790 or e-mail us at 81trg.tget@us.af.mil.

A detailed listing of AETC technical training course objectives may be obtained by written request to the 335 TRS/TRR at Keesler AFB MS.    Section C - Support Materials 4.  The following list of support materials is not all-inclusive; it covers the most frequently referenced areas. 4.1. Weather-Related Training Materials. 4.1.1. Primary access to career field training support materials is the Weather Operations section of the Advanced Distributed Learning Service (ADLS) Gateway.  This web site contains a large amount of training materials, and hyperlinks to materials hosted by other entities.  The goal for this website is to serve as a single source for approved weather training materials.   A listing of other distance learning programs are available for use by trainees is also updated periodically and listed within the Weather Operations section of the ADLS Gateway.  These should be leveraged for unit continuation training. 4.1.2. Some of the materials refer to pages at our OWSs, weather schoolhouse, 14th Weather Squadron, plus other federal government agencies and universities. 4.2. Cooperative Program for Operational Meteorology, Education, and Training (COMET). 4.2.1. COMET® is a cooperative program within the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, sponsored by the National Weather Service.  The AF has been a partner for several years by contributing financial support and receiving training modules addressing the needs of the AF weather operations community.  Access to COMET® materials can be found through the AF Weather Portal web page.           Section D - Training Course Index 5. Purpose.  This section of the CFETP identifies training courses available for the specialties and shows how the courses are used by each MAJCOM in their career field training programs.  Also, refer to the Education and Training Course Catalog (ETCA) at https://etca.randolph.af.mil/ for courses.             24  6.  In-Residence Courses.
