DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE HEADQUARTERS UNITED STATES AIR FORCE WASHINGTON DC AFI32-1051_AFGM2017-01  23 February 2017  MEMORANDUM FOR DISTRIBUTION C - MAJCOMS/FOAs/DRUs/PSUs   FROM: HQ AF/A4  1030 Air Force Pentagon  Washington, DC 20330   SUBJECT: Air Force Guidance Memorandum to AFI 32-1051, Roof Systems Management   By Order of the Secretary of the Air Force, this Guidance Memorandum immediately implements changes to AFI 32-1051, Roof Systems Management, 17 October 2014. Compliance with this memorandum is mandatory. To the extent its directions are inconsistent with other Air Force publications; the information herein prevails, in accordance with AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management.   The Air Force Civil Engineering Commodity Council (CECC) has established Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts to consolidate buying activities for roof repair and replacement construction on CONUS USAF installations where the USAF is the lead agency. The Air Force Installation Contracting Agency (AFICA) is administering these contracts.   Effective immediately, this guidance memorandum establishes policy directing active-duty CONUS-based Air Force Contracting Officers (COs) to evaluate all large (>$150K) roof replacement and repair requirements against the capacity and capabilities of the AFICA IDIQ Contracts when developing their procurement strategy. The IDIQ’s contract scope includes 11 UFGS-Division 7 roof types and also allows for other non-Div. 7 roofing work to be performed up to 20% of the estimated total cost of all Non-Div. 7 work on a project.  ANG and AFRC requirements are excluded from the contract’s scope, unless a project is to be contracted by the base CONS of an active-duty, AF-led CONUS installation.  Additionally, this guidance memorandum mandates the use of the AFICA Roof Replacement and Repair IDIQ contracts on all active-duty CONUS AF-Led installations unless either: a) one or more of the standing exemption criteria outlined below are met, b) waivers have been granted as defined in the AFICA Roofing Program’s Ordering Guide, or 3) capacity and capabilities do not exist on the AFICA Roof Replacement and Repair IDIQ contract vehicles to fulfill the requirement.  All questions or clarifications required concerning the applicability, capacity and capabilities of the AFICA IDIQ contracts should be directed to the AFICA Roofing team.  Finally, this guidance memorandum directs AF-led CONUS installations to migrate to the AFICA Roof Replacement and Repair IDIQ contracts once all preexisting IDIQ contract ordering periods that were in effect prior to 20 January 2016 expire if sufficient AFICA IDIQ capacity and capabilities exist to fulfill requirements.    2 AFI32-1051_AFGM2017-01  23 February 2017  The AFICA Roofing Team should be contacted to address any contract scope, capacity and capability questions and concerns.  Compliance with this policy is only required for work on existing active-duty CONUS USAF installations where the USAF is the lead agency.  AFICA IDIQ contracts should be considered for all roofing sustainment needs (i.e. when roofing repair and/or replacement is the primary aspect of the work); however, base Contracting Officers may award projects either under the $150K threshold or greater than $4M (>$5M for Southeast region) through other contracts without the requirements to either evaluate them against the AFICA IDIQ Contracts or to obtain a formal waiver request. (Tier 1) There are several standing exemptions to the policy mandated in this guidance memorandum. No waivers are necessary when any of the following conditions exist:   1. Requirements contracts in accordance with FAR 16.503 that are in the current ordering period* 2. Local bases’ IDIQ contracts with an effective date prior to the 20 January 2016 effective date of the initial Air Force Guidance Memorandum to AFI 32-1051, Roof Systems Management (i.e. AFI32-1051_AFGM2016-01).*  3. Roofing projects under $150K (Simplified Acquisition Threshold) and very large projects where the total project’s IGE exceeds $4M ($5M in the Southeast region). 4. Local bases with Base Operations Support (BOS) contracts / Base Maintenance Contracts (BMCs) where roofing repair and replacement is in-scope.  5. Joint bases where the AF is not the host Service (procurement performed by host service).  6. Roof repair and replacement projects where the total non-roofing direct construction costs are estimated to exceed 20% of the total direct (Div. 7) roofing project costs (non-roofing work examples include: HVAC, electrical, removal of asbestos, lightning protection, fall protection, structural repairs, ladders, and any other items of work not in Div. 7 of the UFGS). [Example: a project’s total IGE cost is estimated at $1M with direct/Div. 7 roofing costs est. at $650K and other non-roofing costs est. $350K. No waiver is required to do the project using a different contract since non-roofing costs are 54% ($350K/$650K) of the total direct/Div.7 roofing project costs, thereby exceeding the 20% maximum threshold allowed for non-roofing work].    7. Building renovation where roofing is not the major feature of work.  8. Emergency acquisitions allowed by FAR Part 18, like tornadoes, floods and other “Acts of God”.  9. Roofing repair / replacement projects using a Design-Build (DB) acquisition contracting approach.    ∗ Note: HAF/A4 recommended in the first Roofing AFGM issued on 20 Jan 2016 that local bases meeting conditions 1 and 2 above migrate to the enterprise roofing IDIQs following the end of their current ordering period and do not exercise available option years.          3 AFI32-1051_AFGM2017-01  23 February 2017  Outside of the standing exemptions listed above, local bases may submit waiver requests for the mandates set forth in this guidance memorandum.  Final Waiver approval authority has been delegated by HAF/A4 to AFCEC.  Please note that a waiver request which uses as its justification a non-specific, adverse mission impact or perceived ability to achieve a reduced spot-buy price for a single base, does not constitute a valid justification for a waiver. (Tier 1)  The “Waiver Process” is outlined in Ordering Guide and the “Roofing Replacement Repair Mandatory Use Waiver” both found the AFICA Roofing Program’s SharePoint site: https://cs.eis.af.mil/sites/10074/afcc/afica/AFCECC/Roofing%20Public%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?RootFolder=%2Fsites%2F10074%2Fafcc%2Fafica%2FAFCECC%2FRoofing%20Public%20Documents%2FOrdering%20Guide&FolderCTID=0x012000BD3AAD1F7A11DD46831B3209452EFA64&View=%7B67D65A56%2D6CF7%2D46DE%2DB67D%2D94958636458E%7D.  The AFICA IDIQ Contracts ensure the requirements outlined in FAR 19.502 are satisfied as there is the expectation that each Task Order Proposal Request (TOPRs) will obtain offers from two (2) or more small business concerns whose eligibility and technical capability have previously been determined at the IDIQ contract level. A blanket DD2579, Small Business Coordination Record, and a blanket Small Business Administration Offering and Acceptance letter are in place and will streamline awarding task orders to 8(a) roofing contractors across USAF CONUS bases.

Major changes include the addition of Tier wavier authority requirements, updated office symbols, and updated references.   1.  Program  Objective.  The  objective  of  a  roof  management  program  is  to  optimally  manage roof  systems  over  their  life  cycles  to  meet  the  required  levels  of  service  for  Air  Force  real property.    Roof  management  involves  an  asset  management  approach,  taking  into  account performance  measures,  periodic  inspections,  routine  maintenance  and  repair,  and  correct application of quality roofing products. 2.  Responsibilities. 2.1.  Air Force Director of Civil Engineers (AF/A4C): 2.1.1.  Establishes policies for roofing systems. 2.2.  Air Force Civil Engineer Center (AFCEC): 2.2.1.  Establishes  standards  and  criteria repair,  and management of roofing systems IAW mandatory requirements of UFC 3-110-3, Roofing and UFC 3-110-4, Roofing Maintenance and Repair. (T-0) for  design,  maintenance, 2.2.2.  Reviews emerging technologies and evaluates for applicability to the Air Force. 2.2.3.  Evaluates roofing training conducted internally by the Air Force. 2.2.4.  Assists  major  commands  (MAJCOMs)  and  bases  in  troubleshooting  roofing-related issues. 2.3.  MAJCOMs: 2.3.1.

(T-0) 2.4.2.  Design and maintain roofs IAW mandatory requirements of UFC 3-110-3 Roofing and, UFC 3-110-4, Roofing Maintenance and Repair. (T-0) 3.  Roof System Database.  The purpose of the database is to help in effectively managing roof system  assets.    BUILDER™  Sustainment  Management  System  (SMS),  a  Government  Off-the-Shelf  (GOTS)  tool,  is  the  primary  Air  Force  SMS  system.    BUILDER™  must  be  utilized, updated, and maintained by the installation.  (T-0)  It tracks information on the type and age of roof and assigns a condition to the roof based on a fixed set of criteria. With this information, it can  provide  a  remaining  service  life  prediction,  and  reveal  when  to  execute  corrective maintenance  or  repair  actions.    Other  Commercial  Off-the-Shelf  (COTS)  and  GOTS  tools  are authorized,  at  the  installation’s  expense,  as  a  secondary  database  to  support  BUILDER™  for greater project-level details helpful to the base roof technicians and roof engineer. AFI32-1051  17 OCTOBER 2014   3  4.  Condition  Assessment.  Accomplish  condition  assessments  in  accordance  with  criteria  in BUILDER™ SMS.  If a roof section is not inventoried in SMS, upload data as part of the annual maintenance inspections. (T-1) 5.  Maintenance  Inspections.  To  promote  the  efficient  and  economical  use  of  Air  Force  real property assets as required by EO 13327, inspect all roofs at least once annually in  accordance with the inspection guidelines outlined in the BUILDER™ Condition Assessment Manual.
