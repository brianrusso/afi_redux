Serious danger: Condition or practices in a workplace that can cause danger by serious bodily harm or serious sickness, but are not life threatening. Moderate danger: Conditions or practices in a workplace that can cause moderate danger but are not life threatening and will not cause serious illness. Minor danger - Usually administrative deficiencies such as workers not trained on hazards. Usually deficiencies of this nature can be remedied on the spot or addressed at a later date.   Negligible danger – Same as for RAC 4.  5       AFQTP 4B071-3                                                   Craftsman Training Guide:  Hazard Abatement Program  TRAINEE REVIEW QUESTIONS STS Line Item 4.3.2:  Assign occupational health risk assessment codes (RACs)     1.

What is the purpose of a risk assessment code?  A: Risk Assessment Codes are an expression of the degree of risk associated with an occupational hazard or deficiency that combines hazard severity and mishap probability into a single numeric identifier. RACs are tools used by fire, safety and health professionals and commanders to prioritize the abatement plans and mitigate hazards.

What is the responsibility of the BEE in assessing occupational health threats and risks?  A: The BEE’s responsibility in the process is to perform health risk assessments and notify safety office of assigned RACs.
