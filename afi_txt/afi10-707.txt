Major changes include:  interference  resolution  information  and  laser  reporting  IAW  Joint  Staff  guidance, interference resolution checklist, and updated reporting format for interference incidents. 1.  Air  Force  Spectrum  Interference  Resolution  (AFSIR)  Program.  CJCSI  3320.02  states DOD components will attempt to  resolve interference affecting systems  under their auspices at the  lowest  level  possible  within  their  chain  of  command.    The  AFSIR  program  pertains  to  Air Force units experiencing interference at any time except when under the operational control of a Combatant  Command.    MAJCOMs  with  units  located  outside  of  the  continental  United  States may  report  and  resolve  interference  in  accordance  with  geographical  Unified  Command procedures  and  can  request  AFSMO  or  QFIRC  assistance,  if  needed.    Report  any  Air  Force interference experienced while supporting joint operations in  accordance with Joint Task Force or Combatant Command procedures. Interference to space systems, including space, ground, and control  segments  shall  be  reported  to  your  MAJCOM,  in  accordance  with  Air  Force  Space Command  (AFSPC)  supplemental  guidance.  (T-1)    The  focus  of  the  AFSIR  program  is  to resolve EMI at the lowest organizational level.  Submit all reports, initial, follow-on, and closure through the MAJCOM to AFSMO. 2.  Electromagnetic  Interference  (EMI).  EMI  can  be  caused  by  enemy,  neutral,  friendly,  or natural sources, and must be resolved on a case-by-case basis.  Users must investigate and report as outlined in paragraph 3. (T-1) 2.1.  EMI from DOD Users. When the EMI clearly results from another DOD user, attempt to resolve the interference at the lowest organizational level.  After all local efforts have been exhausted  to  resolve  the  EMI,  request  assistance  through  command  frequency  management channels.  Within their area of responsibility, installation commanders and DoD AFCs have the authority to implement radio silence/Cease Buzzer procedures for a suspected interfering activity until the interference issue can be resolved. 2.2.  EMI  from  Non-DOD  Users.  Request  assistance through  command  frequency management  channels.  Do  not  go  directly  to  the  Federal  Communications  Commission (FCC)  or  any  other  agency.  AFSMO  will  coordinate  with  the  FCC  and  other  government agencies at the national level if the investigation shows that non-Air Force equipment caused AFI10-707  22 DECEMBER 2015 3 the EMI.  Within their AOR, DoD AFCs are authorized to locally coordinate with any federal or non-federal agency to resolve interference at the lowest level possible. 2.3.  EMI from suspected hostile sources.  The primary difference between hostile and non-hostile  EMI  is  intent.    In  a  non-operational  environment,  all  incidents  should  initially  be treated  as  non-hostile  EMI  until  proven  otherwise.    EMI  occurring  in  an  operational environment is to be considered hostile until a determination can be made as to the source of the  problem.    EMI  from  hostile  sources  should  be  reported  to  the  Joint  Spectrum  Center (JSC) IAW CJCSI 3320.02.  Military Satellite Communications incidents will be handled  in accordance  with  the  procedures  outlined  in  CJCSM  3320.02  and  SI  714.04,  Satellite Communications. 3.  Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) Resolution. 3.1.  The  victim  of  the  interference  will  contact  the  local  installation  spectrum  manager (ISM) or other point of contact identified by the higher headquarters.  The following actions should  be  initiated/accomplished  prior  to  the  requesting  assistance  from  the  higher headquarters spectrum manager per paragraph 3.2. (T-2) 3.1.1.  System operator will contact equipment maintenance personnel to determine if the EMI is the result of maintenance actions or an equipment malfunction. (T-2) 3.1.2.  System  operator  will  contact  other  known  nearby  units  to  ascertain  if  they  are experiencing the same type of EMI.  This may aid in identifying the interference source. (T-2) 3.1.3.  When  co-channel  interference  (interference  between  systems  assigned  similar frequency  assignments)  is  suspected,  the  ISM  will  attempt  to  determine  the  location  of frequency assignments that fall within the bandwidth of the victim receiver. (T-2) 3.1.4.  If  resources  are  available,  system  operations  and  equipment  maintenance personnel will attempt to determine the bandwidth, relative amplitude, and modulation of the EMI with a spectrum analyzer. (T-2)  Find the approximate bandwidth by varying the receiver frequency to determine the affected frequency band.  3.1.5.  After  exhausting  all  local  resolution  efforts,  the  ISM  or  MAJCOM  Spectrum Management Office (SMO)  can contact the 85th EIS (AFSPC) located at Keesler AFB MS  directly  for  an  initial  assessment  of  the  problem,  obtain  consultation,  and recommendations  regarding  actions,  coordination  and  techniques  that  can  be  used  to identify the source and resolve the EMI. (T-2) 3.2.  If  resolution  is  not  obtained  in  accordance  with  paragraph  3.1.,  the  ISM  will  request assistance  from  the  higher  headquarters  spectrum  manager.  (T-3)    The  higher  headquarters spectrum  manager  should  use  any  additional  information  and  tools  available  to  resolve  the EMI and should request a report as outlined in paragraph 3.6. 3.3.  If the MAJCOM spectrum manager cannot resolve the EMI, notify AFSMO and the 85th EIS for assistance. (T-2) 3.4.  If  resolution  is  not  achieved  in  accordance  with  paragraph  3.3.,  a  QFIRC  may  be required.  Coordinate  approval  between  MAJCOM  SMO  and  85th  EIS.    TDY  funds  for QFIRC support is typically provided by the requesting organization.  Organizations will need 4 AFI10-707  22 DECEMBER 2015 to  consider  avenues  to  expedite  funding  with  the  85th  EIS  based  on  the  level  of  EMI  and impact to operations. 3.5.  AFSMO  can  also  request  national-level  federal  agency  and/or  JSC  support,  as appropriate. (T-2) 3.6.  EMI Reporting: 3.6.1.  Report  Precedence.    The  ISM  and  MAJCOM  SMO  will  determine  precedence consistent with the urgency of the reported situation. If EMI is suspected to be intrusion, or jamming, it should be reported immediately. All other EMI events should be reported within two hours of the start of the event. (T-2) 3.6.2.  Security  Classification  of  EMI  Reports.  Units  must  evaluate  the  security sensitivity  of  the  EMI  on  the  affected  system  and  classify  the  report  accordingly.  (T-1) Security  classification  of  interference  incidents/reports  is  determined  principally  by nationality and location of the implied or stated source of the interference and the security sensitivity  of  the  affected  military  system.  Stations  located  in  combat  areas  or  having  a sensitive military mission generally must classify all interference reports. Guidelines for classifying interference incidents are contained in CJCSI 3320.02. 3.6.3.  Report  Format.    EMI  incidents  shall  be  entered  into  the  JSIROnline  (JSIRO) collaboration portal while resolution using local organic assets or host nation assistance is pursued.  (T-2).    Entering  the  incident  in  the  JSIRO  collaboration  portal  only  provides situational  awareness.    It does not  generate a request  for technical  support.   The JSIRO collaboration portal is located on the Secure Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet) at  http://intelshare.intelink.sgov.gov/sites/jsir/default.aspx.    All  spectrum  managers involved  with  EMI  resolution  will  ensure  they  have  proper  access  and  permissions  to access the JSIRO portal to be able to establish alerts and to be able to edit and maintain reports.  As  an  alternative  method  of  reporting,  AFSIR  reports  can  be  reported  by electronic means (e-mail).  See Attachment 3 for Offline Report Format. 3.6.4.  Report Addresses. 3.6.4.1.  Air Force units submitting email notification of JSIRO reports or offline AFSIR reports through their chain of command to their higher headquarters (Wing, NAF, Command SMOs) as the action addressee, will provide an info copy to AFSMO NIPRNET: afsmoccworkflow@us.af.mil or SIPRNET usaf.jbanafw.afsmo-mla-do-list@mail.smil.mil and 85th EIS NIPRNET:   85eis.scym.1@us.af.mil and 85eis.scx.1@us.af.mil or SIPRNET 85eis.scy@aetc.af.smil.mil. 3.6.4.2.  MAJCOMs submitting offline reports to AFSMO NIPRNET afsmo.doo@us.af.mil or SIPRNET afsmo.doo@af.pentagon.smil.mil and the 85th EIS NIPRNET 85eis.scym.1@us.af.mil and 85eis.scx.1@us.af.mil or SIPRNET usaf.keesler.81-tw.mbx.85-eis-scy as the action addressee with an info copy to JSC NIPRNET  disa.sosc@mail.mil or SIPRNETdisa.sosc@mail.smil.mil.  All requests for JSC support will be coordinated through AFSMO/SQ. (T-2). 3.6.5.  Exercise Interference. During exercise periods, coordinate all EMI reports with the Electronic Warfare Cell in the Air Operations Center or EW Duty Officer.  Do not submit AFI10-707  22 DECEMBER 2015 5 an  exercise-related  report  if  jamming  or  intrusion  activities  are  authorized  during  an exercise  and  determined  to  be  the  source  of  interference.  Depending  on  geographical location,  contact  the  appropriate  Range  Spectrum  Manager  or  DoD  Area  Frequency Coordinator to determine if the interference is an approved part of the exercise. 3.6.6.  Exceptions to Reporting. Do not report an incident when: (T-3) 3.6.6.1.  The interference is transient EMI from natural sources (e.g., rain, lightning, etc.). 3.6.6.2.  The interference  only  affects noninterference basis for training purposes. training frequencies  assigned  on  a 3.6.6.3.  Space  weather  (e.g.,  HF  fades,  Polar  Cap  Absorption  (PCA)  events, geomagnetic storming, etc.) is the suspected, or confirmed, cause of the interference. For assistance, notify the local weather unit of the EMI to include date, time, location, system,  and  frequency  impacts.  The  local  weather  unit  can  contact  the  Air  Force Weather Agency, as appropriate. 3.6.6.4.  The  interference  is  only  experienced  aboard  intelligence,  surveillance  and reconnaissance  (ISR)  aircraft  aloft  and  is  localized  when  mission  equipment  or payload equipment is turned on/off or used.  In these cases, the interference must be reported  to  the  flying  unit's  Director  of  Maintenance/Maintenance  Officer  and Director of Operations. The unit's Director of Maintenance/Maintenance Officer may report the  EMI to  AFMC;  the flying unit's Director of Operations must characterize the  operational  impact.    The  unit's  Director  of  Maintenance/  Maintenance  Officer must  determine  if  unit  maintenance  or  calibration  will  resolve  the  EMI  before notifying AFMC.   If notified, AFMC must determine if any field  or depot  upgrades meant  to  resolve the EMI are already scheduled.  AFMC is  responsible for reporting the EMI to AFSMO if the EMI can be detected at a distance of more than 50 meters from the aircraft. 3.7.  Laser  Event  Reporting.    IAW  with  CJCSM  3320.02,  the  National  Air  &  Space Intelligence  Center  (NASIC)  will  collect  and  maintain  data  on  laser  events  against  air, ground, and naval assets to include personnel.  Data collection on laser events is necessary to understand  the  nature  of  the  threat  and  to  develop  countermeasures.    Air  Force  units  will report laser events against air/ground assets and personnel through a reporting process using the  following  SIPRNET  link:  http://www.naic.wrightpatterson.af.smil.mil/DEW/gliderr  or  http://www.naic.ic.gov/dew/le.shtml Intelligence Communications  System  (JWICS).  (T-2)  Listings  of  previous  events  can  be  accessed  at either  http://www.naic.wrightpatterson.af.smil.mil/DEW/glider        AF  units  may  call  the NAIC and Avionics Directed Energy Branch (NAIC/ADEE) with questions at the following numbers:  Commercial 937-522-4820/4818/4885/4817 or DSN: 672-4820/4818/4885/4817. Joint  Worldwide on the 4.  Requesting Quick Fix Interference Reduction Capability (QFIRC) and JSC Assistance: 4.1.  QFIRC.  The QFIRC reduces or  eliminates unintentional  (non-hostile) EMI  associated with  Air  Force  operational  equipment.    The  QFIRC  service  analyzes  and  recommends corrective actions for reported EMI problems. The 85th EIS provides QFIRC to all Air Force units.  This unit can provide people and equipment to perform on-site direction finding and interference  problem  analysis.  The  85th  EIS  will  document  corrective  actions  and  give 6 AFI10-707  22 DECEMBER 2015 recommendations for solving EMI problems in a formal report that will be forwarded to the requesting  unit  and  to  its  parent  MAJCOM  and  AFSMO.    QFRIC  assistance  must  be coordinated through the involved MAJCOM spectrum management channels. (T-2) 4.2.  JSC.      The  JSC  maintains  a  central  database  of  EMI  cases,  resolutions,  and  lessons learned  for  all  DoD  EMI  and  provides  analytical  and  on-site  assistance  in  resolving  EMI problems.

Checklist for EMI Characterization and Resolution of EMI at the Local Level To assist users and spectrum managers at the local level, the following checklist can be used to identify and potentially resolve EMI.  This checklist should be implemented prior to or in conjunction with submitting an AFSIR through the appropriate chain of command to the MAJCOM. STEP ACTION 1 2  Start a log and collect as much information about the EMI as possible.  Record what interference sounds like.  If appropriate measurement equipment is available, attempt should be made to quantify the characteristics of the interference signal.  These characteristics include the interfering source center frequency, bandwidth, relative amplitude, modulation, direction of interference, time of occurrence, and any other characteristics that can be obtained.  Geographical Information 3-1  Check with other units in the geographical area to determine the area affected.  3-2  Verify exact location of receiver using GPS, if available.  4 Determine interference start and stop times.  Have maintenance personnel: Ensure all connectors are tight.  Ensure antenna cables are in good condition.  Ensure equipment is operating IAW technical manual specifications 5 6  and frequency assignment parameters.  Verify antenna is on the correct azimuth and elevation.  Environment Information 7-1  Contact all nearby units to determine if there is any recently installed equipment.  7-2  Contact the Electronic Warfare Officer (EWO) to determine if there is any local jamming or exercise occurring in the local area.  If air assets are suspect, validate with spectrum analyzer and have EWO validate.  7-3  Check with equipment and facility maintenance personnel to determine if the interference is the result of maintenance actions or an equipment malfunction.  This should include non RF equipment that can cause spark-type interference used to support the operation of RF equipment (e.g., thermostat-controlled devices, electric motors, welders, etc.) If possible, conduct a site survey looking for other users and 7-4 COMPLETE Y/N              AFI10-707  22 DECEMBER 2015 13 environmental considerations that may impact affected emitter. 7-5  Check to see if construction is being conducted in the immediate area. 7-6  Determine whether the natural environment is the cause  Frequency Assignment Information 8-1  Verify through the ISM or MAJCOM spectrum management office 8-2 8-3 8-4 that a valid frequency assignment authorization exists. If no assignment exists, cease transmission and request valid frequency. If valid assignment exists, change to alternate frequency and determine if interference is present.  If a valid assignment exists and the interference goes away after changing to an alternate frequency, submit an interference report through your MAJCOM spectrum management office. 8-5  Where co-channel or adjacent channel interference is suspected (i.e., the interfering signal overlaps the operating bandwidth of the victim receiver), check with local and area frequency management personnel to determine if other locally operated equipment has been recently assigned a co-channel/or adjacent channel frequency. General Characterization Determine if the following are true to help characterize the interference:  9            The interfering signal is encrypted. The interfering signal is understandable, e.g., voice. Note all settings (demods, bandwidths, gains, etc.) of your receiver equipment that enabled you to hear intelligible information on the interfering signal. The interference is due to a steady receive key indicating equipment failures, glitches, or lapses in operational discipline.  14 AFI10-707  22 DECEMBER 2015 Attachment 3 OFFLINE REPORT FORMAT Figure A3.1.  Offline Report Format  Since all reported AFSIR reports should be submitted to  the DoD central repository managed by the JSC (JSIRO) at http://intelshare.intelink.sgov.gov/sites/jsir/default.aspx, the following reporting format will be used to facilitate the process and should be reported by any electronic means possible, email being the preferred method.
