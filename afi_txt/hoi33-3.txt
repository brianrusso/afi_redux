Actions  originate  both  external  (such  as,  from  the  President,  members  of  Congress, and  the  Secretary  of  Defense)  and  internal  to  the  HAF  (generated  by  the  Glass  Doors, preparatory sessions, or policy update/review). 2.1.1.1.  All  tasks  requiring  response  to  the  Glass  Doors  must  be  tracked  in  TMT  for awareness. 2.1.1.2.  If  a  2-Letter  receives  a  task  from  outside  HAF/ES  requiring  Glass  Door coordination  or  response,  begin  working  the  task,  but  provide  a  copy  to  HAF/ES  to properly task and track. 2.1.1.3.  All  correspondence  directed  to,  or  originated  by,  the  Glass  Doors  is  tasked  in TMT to the appropriate OPR by HAF/ES. 2.1.1.4.  Before  task  assignment,  conducts  research  to  preclude  task  duplication  and  to locate and reference past or related work. 2.1.1.5.  As a general rule, task assignment will occur within 1 duty day of receipt of task instructions. 2.1.2.  There is only one OPR assigned and identified in TMT as the ‘Primary OPR.’ 2.1.3.  The task originator or Primary OPR is responsible for assigning office of coordinating responsibility (OCR(s)). 2.1.4.  TMT is the primary tasking and tracking tool for the HAF. 2.1.5.  All tasks will include the following instructions: 2.1.5.1.  Task Summary 2.1.5.2.  Deliverable 2.1.5.3.  Minimum required OCRs 2.1.5.4.  Suspense date IAW section 2.1.8. 2.1.6.  The following task actions are most common: 2.1.6.1.  Secretary  of  Defense  (SecDef)  or  Deputy  Secretary  of  Defense  (DepSecDef) Action  or  Information.    Actions  requiring  preparation  of  correspondence  for  SecDef  or DepSecDef  signature  are to  SecAF  from  OSD  Executive  Secretariat Correspondence Management Office (OSD(CMO)). tasked 2.1.6.1.1.  Each  staff  package  is  processed  through  HAF/ES  after  coordination through  designated  OSD  action  offices  and  must  contain  an  ACTION  MEMO  or INFO  MEMO  for  SecAF  signature  prepared  IAW  OSD  guidance  (DoD  5110.4-M-Vol I and II). HOI33-3  6 JULY 2015   7  2.1.6.1.2.  Requests  for  extension  or  transfer  to  another  OSD  organization/agency must  be  accomplished  via  SD  Form  391,  Secretary  of  Defense  Correspondence Action  Report,  with  justification.    Secretary  of  Defense  (SD)  Form  391  will  be submitted to HAF/ES for approval, signature, and forwarding to OSD(CMO). 2.1.6.2.  Other  OSD  Agency  Actions.    Unless  otherwise  directed,  HAF  OPRs  will respond directly to the OSD action office/point of contact (POC).  Requests for due date extension or external transfer by the OPR must be negotiated with and approved by the OSD  POC.    It  is  the  OPR’s  responsibility  to  notify  HAF/ES  of  approved  requests.  Additionally,  it  is  the  OPR’s  responsibility  to  determine  if  Glass  Door  involvement  is required, whether for action or information. 2.1.6.3.  Glass  Door  Action.    These  actions  require  preparation  of  correspondence  for Glass Door signature, approval, or information, and can be self-generated or in response to a tasking.  Unless otherwise directed, responses for these actions must be forwarded to HAF/ES for further processing. 2.1.6.4.  Direct  Reply.    The  OPR  responds  directly  to  the  writer  without  approval  or signature  of  a  higher  echelon.    The  OPR  determines  the  level  of  response  within  their organization. 2.1.6.4.1.  The signature should be of at least equal rank or organizational level as the writer of the incoming correspondence, if applicable and appropriate. 2.1.6.4.2.  When  the  action  has  been  tasked  by  HAF/ES,  an  electronic  copy  of  the reply will be loaded into TMT Tabs folder. 2.1.6.4.3.  The  OPR  is  responsible  for  retaining  a  copy  of  all  direct  reply  responses IAW AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records. 2.1.6.4.4.  Should  the  OPR  determine  Glass  Door  response  is  more  appropriate, process accordingly through HAF/ES. 2.1.6.4.5.  Direct  Reply  responses  should  begin  with  a  reference  to  the  constituent’s correspondence and who the response is “on behalf of.” 2.1.7.  Task Control Numbers.  A unique identifying number is assigned to each task created using  TMT.    For  tracking  purposes,  OPRs  will  ensure  staff  packages  and  task-related correspondence  (i.e.  email)  make  reference  to,  at  a  minimum,  the  last  five  numbers  of  the task control numbers (e.g., TMT 12345). 2.1.8.  Suspenses 2.1.8.1.  Task Suspense:  Date an action or coordination must be completed. 2.1.8.2.  OPR Suspense:  Date an action or coordination is due to the task initiator. 2.1.8.2.1.  Packages  for  Glass  Door  processing  are  due  to  HAF/ES  five  duty  days prior to Task Suspense.  HAF/ES will adjust this date accordingly for short suspenses or at the direction of the Director of Staff. 2.1.8.2.2.  Congressional  Reports  are  due  to  HAF/ES  30  calendar  days  prior  to congressionally mandated suspense.   8  HOI33-3  6 JULY 2015 2.1.8.2.3.  Congressional  correspondence  is  due  from  CRC  no  later  than  three calendar days prior to date due to  Congress.   Note:   If CRC  sends an interim reply, package is due to HAF/ES five duty days prior to the updated Task Suspense. 2.1.8.2.4.  Top-4 correspondence (invites, replies to letters, etc) is due to HAF/ES 14 calendar days from tasking. 2.1.8.2.5.  Direct reply OSD packages are due to HAF/ES one duty day prior to OSD suspense. 2.1.8.2.6.  General Glass Door taskings are due to HAF/ES as directed. 2.1.8.2.7.  Responses to Public Bulk mail are due to HAF/ES 30 calendar days from tasking. 2.1.8.3.  OCR Suspense:  Date that OCR action is due to the OPR. 2.1.9.  HOT  Packages.    A  ‘HOT  package’  requires  immediate  senior  leader  attention.    The use of ‘HOT’  as an identifier will be  used  when  the issue affects  the immediate safety  and security of personnel, is required for ongoing contingencies, war efforts, or when the SecDef, DepSecDef, SecAF or CSAF have asked for immediate response. 2.1.9.1.  Justification for the HOT package will be provided in  the “Purpose” section of the  SSS,  explaining  why  the  package  is  HOT  and  must  be  completed  by  a  specific date/time. 2.1.9.2.  Communication  between  the  OPR,  HAF/ES,  and  the  HAF  Director  of  Staff  is crucial to assuring timely processing of a HOT package.   2.1.9.3.  A package is not HOT simply because it is late meeting a suspense. 2.2.  Task Acceptance, Rejection or Transfer. 2.2.1.  HAF 2-Letters accept or reject tasks within 1 duty day for tasks with suspense dates of 2 weeks or less; within 2 duty days for tasks with suspense dates of 2 weeks or more. 2.2.2.  After  the  task  acceptance  or  rejection  window  has  closed,  the  tasked  OPR  is responsible for the task.  The tasked OPR may coordinate assignment transfers. 2.2.2.1.  If seeking transfer, ensure the accepting official has the authority to accept and the capability to complete the action. 2.2.2.2.  Annotate in TMT the transfer request, name, office, and telephone number of the accepting  official  and  reject  the  TMT  or  complete  the  action  to  return  the  task  to HAF/ES.  HAF/ES will then forward the task to the new responsible office. 2.2.2.3.  If the task is accepted, the task is forwarded to the AO in a timely manner.  The OPR  of  the  task  is  responsible  for  adding  or  clarifying  task  instructions  and  guidance before assignment. 2.2.3.  If rejected, justification and recommended action office must be submitted to HAF/ES using  TMT.    If  returned  within  the  prescribed  time-limits  with  reasonable  rationale  for reassignment, HAF/ES shall accept the action for transfer without further coordination.  The Director of Staff is the final arbitrator if a rejection of a tasking cannot be resolved. HOI33-3  6 JULY 2015   9  2.3.  Suspense Extension Requests. 2.3.1.  HAF extension requests will be made within the task using TMT. 2.3.2.  Justification must be provided for extensions. 2.3.3.  The OPR will make proactive requests to adjust established suspenses. 2.3.4.  Extensions  that  cannot  be  granted  by  HAF/ES  will  be  forwarded  to  the  Director  of Staff  for consideration. 2.3.5.  HAF/ES  will  indicate  in  the  task  instructions  if  an  external  agency  is  the  final approval authority and if requesting extensions directly through that agency is appropriate. 2.3.6.  For SecDef/DepSecDef tasked items, these actions MUST be fully justified on the SD Form 391 and processed through the OPR chain to HAF/ES. 2.3.7.  For  other  OSD  Agency  Actions/Request  for  Coordination.    Requests  for  due  date extension must be negotiated by the OPR with the OSD POC. 2.4.  Response Development. 2.4.1.  When  we  as  Airmen  develop  a  consistent,  coherent,  and  coordinated  position,  we speak with one voice and we are best able to articulate our Service preferences. 2.4.2.  The OPR is responsible for collecting information, presenting all sides of an issue and making a recommendation. 2.4.3.  Responses are coordinated via HAF TMT. 2.4.4.  All staff actions for Glass Door processing require an SSS. 2.4.5.  When preparing HAF correspondence, reference Chapters 4 - 5 for specific templates.  HAF approved templates are provided in TMT under ‘HAF Templates.’ 2.4.6.  When  preparing  OSD  correspondence,  follow  DoD  Manual  (DoDM)  5110.04-M, Manual For Written Material, Volumes 1 & 2.  OSD templates are provided in TMT under ‘HAF Templates.’ 2.5.  Coordination. 2.5.1.  Complete HAF coordination gives affected organizations an opportunity to contribute to  and comment on actions.  Early  involvement  of all concerned organizations is  crucial  to full development of an issue/response. 2.5.1.1.  All requests, at any level, for coordination must be through TMT. 2.5.1.2.  Be aware not all 2-Letters are of equal size.  Coordinate at a higher level within a 2-Letter on how to properly coordinate with their office when required. 2.5.1.3.  A  properly  coordinated  action  considers  the  full  range  of  options  on  the  issue and presents all relevant facts.  The extent of coordination depends on the nature of the action. 2.5.2.  All  tasks  requiring  SecAF/USecAF  or  CSAF/VCSAF  action  require  a  legal  review.  Contact  the  Office  of  the  Air  Force  General  Counsel  (SAF/GC)  or  the  Air  Force  Judge Advocate General’s (AF/JA) office early so they can assign a project officer and provide an OCR for TMT tasking.   10  HOI33-3  6 JULY 2015 2.5.2.1.  As a rule, SAF 2-Letters contact SAF/GC and Air Staff 2-Letters contact AF/JA. 2.5.2.2.  SAF/GC and AF/JA will coordinate with the other office or advise requesting 2-Letter on how to proceed. 2.5.2.3.  SAF/GC  and/or  AF/JA  will  review  the  final  product  before  the  package  is moved to the Glass Doors. 2.5.3.  All  correspondence  staffed  to  the  Glass  Doors  requires  appropriate  2-Letter coordination. 2.5.3.1.  2-Letter coordination will be annotated at the bottom of the SSS. 2.5.3.2.  The Primary OPR’s 2-Letter Principal or Deputy must sign the SSS. 2.5.4.  Package  requesting  2-Letter  (OCR)  coordination  should  be  properly  staffed  and coordinated through lower levels. 2.5.4.1.  Lower  level  coordination  will  completely  review  the  package  for  readability (grammar, spelling, format, etc) and content. 2.5.4.2.  For  short  suspenses,  3-Letter  coordination  is  the  lowest  starting  point  required for coordination.  Because subject matter experts normally reside in a 3-Letter or below, 2-Letter coordination will be much quicker if a 3-Letter has provided coordination. 2.5.5.  Coordination responses are provided in one of three ways: 2.5.5.1.  Concur:  Agree with the package, as written. 2.5.5.2.  Non-concur:  Disagree with the package, as written. 2.5.5.2.1.  Must be accompanied by specific comments and/or recommended changes and supporting rationale. 2.5.5.2.2.  An attempt must be made to resolve non-concur responses before moving forward  for  final  approval/signature.    If  non-concur  cannot  be  resolved,  state  the reason why in the “Views of Others” section of the SSS. 2.5.5.3.  Concur  w/  comment(s):    Agree  with  the  package;  however,  recommended changes or comments are provided. 2.5.6.  Comments  should  be  organized  using  a  Comment  Resolution  Matrix  (CRM)  (HAF CRM  template  provided  in  TMT  under  ‘HAF  Templates’  under  ‘Staffing  Items’)  and  are categorized in one of three ways: 2.5.6.1.  Critical:  Major deficiencies or disagreements with the intent or content that will result in a non-concur.   Changes must be made or addressed in the staff package before moving forward. 2.5.6.2.  Major:  Incorrect material that may cause non-concurrence if not corrected. 2.5.6.3.  Substantive:  Proposed changes to the intent or content of the staff package that should be considered before the staff package is submitted for final action. 2.5.6.4.  Administrative:    Proposed  changes  to  the  format,  grammar  or  language  of  the staff package. HOI33-3  6 JULY 2015   11  2.5.7.  Re-accomplishment  of  Coordination.    If  significant  changes  are  made  to  a  staff package,  coordination  must  be  re-accomplished.    Any  changes  necessary  to  resolve  a  non-concurring view of one organization could be significant. 2.5.8.  Each level (e.g., 4-letter, 3-Letter, 2-Letter, etc.) is allowed a minimum of 2 duty days to complete coordination. 2.5.8.1.  Coordination  timeline  may  be  shortened  only  if  the  suspense  will  not  allow  2 duty days for each level. 2.5.8.2.  A  staff  package  held  up  in  the  coordination  process  robs  the  action  office  of staffing  time  and  reduces  time  the  senior  leadership  has  to  review  a  package  and  make critical decisions. 2.5.8.3.  OPRs  and  AOs  should  work  with  the  appropriate  2-Letter  executive  officer  to solve delays.  If an appropriate resolution cannot be made at the lowest level, OPRs and AOs may forward staff packages on to the next coordinating office and the AO will place “Coordination Not Received” in the appropriate coordination block. 2.5.9.  OSD coordination. 2.5.9.1.  For packages requiring SecDef or DepSecDef action/info: 2.5.9.1.1.  HAF/ES will provide instructions in the tasking when OSD coordination is required. 2.5.9.1.2.  HAF/ES will enter the coordination package into OSD’s task management system. 2.5.9.2.  For  all  other  OSD  coordination,  coordinate  directly  with  OSD  agencies  (most often via email). 2.6.  Package Routing (Electronic versus Hard Copy). 2.6.1.  Staffing packages will be routed throughout the HAF electronically using TMT. 2.6.2.  Hard-copy packages are allowed by approved exception only. 2.6.2.1.  Submit requests for exception to policy (ETP) by e-mailed to Director, HAF/ES, who  will  coordinate  with  the  appropriate  Glass  Door  office  to  obtain  or  verify  a  hard-copy package exception is approved, for individual tasks or by category. 2.6.2.2.  HAF/ES will maintain a list of approved exceptions for categories or tasks. 2.6.3.  Hard-copy packages will be delivered to HAF/ES with a TMT task number included on the SSS. 2.6.3.1.  Hard-copy packages will not be dropped off at any Glass Door office. 2.6.3.2.  A TMT task with an SSS showing required Glass  Door routing will be used to track the hard-copy package. 2.6.3.2.1.

The  purpose  of  a  SSS  is  to  provide  information  needed  by  the  decision  maker  to complete  an  action  in  a  brief,  concise  format.    The  SSS  provides  the  framework  for  a decision to be made but in most cases is not the decision document. 3.1.2.  The SSS template is available within TMT (‘HAF Templates’ under ‘Staffing Items’). Figure 3.1.  The SSS Template and Guidelines.    14  HOI33-3  6 JULY 2015 3.2.  General Information for the SSS. 3.2.1.  The  SSS  format  provided  in  Figure  3.1.  is  the  HAF  standard.    If  a  section  is  not required use ‘N/A’ (do not delete a heading). 3.2.2.  The SSS is used to request coordination (Coord), approval (Appr), signature (Sig), or to forward  information (Info). 3.2.3.  The SSS should be no more than one page when printed.  Provide detailed information in Tabs.  All Tabs attached should be referenced in the SSS. 3.2.4.  Include appropriate security classification markings (See AFI 31-401). 3.2.5.  Strict  adherence  to  file  naming  conventions  is  important.    Electronic  files  should  be named, "Tab 1 - File name", "Tab 2 - File name".  Use this naming convention when saving your files.  However, do not use this format when listing your attachments on the SSS.  Use standard attachment format (1. File Name). 3.2.6.  Documents  that  require  action  are  placed  at  Tab  1.    If  multiple  action  documents, continue in successive Tabs. 3.2.6.1.  For OSD packages, include the original package as the primary Tab (e.g., Tab 2) and use that number plus the OSD attachment references (e.g., Tab 2A, 2B, 2C, etc.). 3.2.6.2.  If  multiple  memorandums  or  letters  require  Glass  Door  signature,  include  all applicable letters in a single file. 3.2.7.  Hard-copy packages  (refer to section 2.6.) 3.2.7.1.  Print the SSS and attachments. 3.2.7.2.  Use the SSS as a routing slip on the cover of the folder. 3.2.7.3.  Forward TMT and deliver package to HAF/ES. 3.2.7.4.  If returned for rewrite, re-coordinate, as necessary.  Re-submit updated package with original (marked up) documents in the folder for reference. HOI33-3  6 JULY 2015   15  Chapter 4 THE PERSONALIZED LETTER 4.1.

Task  Management  Tool  has  been  designated  as  the  official  tasking/tracking  tool  for  all task/staff packages within the HAF, and the integrated SharePoint® system has been designated as  the  document  repository  for  this  tool.    However,  records  managers  are  reminded  that SharePoint® is not a certified System of Record.  Unit records management shared drives have been designated as official records storage. A6.1.1.  Training  is  key  to  being  successful  using  TMT.    HAF/ES  recommends  all  users complete  the  computer  based  training  (CBT)  available  within  TMT  under  ‘Training Resources.’ A6.1.2.  Other  training  is  also  available  within  TMT  under  ‘Training  Resources’  such  as “How 2s” and “Getting Started with TMT.” A6.2.  The HAF has established processes and products which are documented in core references for  use  by  all  Secretariat/Air  Staff  offices.    References  include:    DoD  5110.4-M,  AFMAN  33-326,  HOI  33-3,  and  AFH  33-337.    HOI  33-3  provides  guidance  that  is  unique  to  the  HAF  and when there is conflicting guidance, HOI 33-3 takes precedence.  Access to all these references is available via TMT under ‘Staffing Publications.’ A6.2.1.  The HAF strives to ensure timeliness and quality of correspondence requiring Glass Door  (SecAF,  USecAF,  CSAF,  VCSAF,  AVCSAF)  coordination/signature/approval  and providing task responses.  This same goal applies in completing actions for your principals.  A predictable, repeatable and accountable process ensures timeliness and quality to provide minimal confusion to Action Officers and executive support staff. A6.2.2.  The  staffing  process  applies  across  the  HAF.    We  must  document  all  leadership policy and decision items within a proper records/filing system. A6.3.  General TMT Rules and Descriptions: A6.3.1.  TMT  will  NOT  be  used  to  communicate  with  agencies  outside  of  HAF  unless otherwise specified (e.g., OSD). A6.3.1.1.  Instructions  for  coordination  with  MAJCOMs  are  covered  in  the  MAJCOM Tasking ROE (Rules of Engagement) located in TMT under ‘Staffing Publications.’ A6.3.1.2.  If specific instructions for coordinating with an agency are not covered in this HOI or the tasking ROE, contact the agency and determine the proper tasking authority and method. A6.3.2.  Document  Spaces.    The  following  are  the  HAF  TMT  document  libraries  and  their purpose. A6.3.2.1.  Original  Docs  library  is  used  to  save  incoming  task  documents.    If  a  staff package is being routed for Top 4 action, a copy of the original tasking document(s) are located here. A6.3.2.2.  Tabs library is used to  save ‘Tabs’ that are referenced in  the SSS in the final package. HOI33-3  6 JULY 2015   47  A6.3.2.3.  Public  Workspace  library  is  used  for  collaboration  documents  and  all documents should be saved using an obvious naming convention, e.g., IG-Comments on Using TMT, 17 May 10. A6.4.  Creating a task: A6.4.1.  The  staffing  process  can  begin  at  any  level,  however,  HAF/ES  is  the  tasking authority for the Glass Doors.  Congressional tasks will be assigned by SAF/LL and the CRC as OPR who in turn will task the appropriate subject matter expert as OCR. A6.4.2.  Before creating a task, a search of TMT should be conducted to ensure no other task has been created that can be used to accomplish your task.  If a match is found,  contact the initiator/owning org to see if you may join in on the task.  A HAF/ES task created on behalf of the Top 4 or AVCSAF takes precedence over any duplicate task. A6.4.3.  HAF  organizations  may  receive  a  task  directly  from  an  outside  agency,  e.g., OSD(P), requiring Glass Door coordination/action.  In this situation, the owning OPRs will begin working the task but forward the information to HAF/ES to create a task and suspense in TMT.  This allows for proper visibility to manage and ensure timely responses. A6.4.4.  Refer  to  Figure  A6.1.    The  blocks  highlighted  on  the  ‘General’  tab  are  required before assigning a task in TMT to an OPR.  HAF/ES completes this action for HAF tracked tasks. Figure A6.1.  Creating a New TMT.  A6.4.4.1.  Subject:  Describe the task.  Add ‘OS - ' or ‘CC - ' for SecAF or CSAF action. A6.4.4.2.  Suspense:  IAW with Section 2.5.  This block is the HAF suspense date.  A6.4.4.3.  Classification: A6.4.4.3.1.  UNCLASSIFIED  –  Used  for  all  taskers  not  constrained  by  the  four descriptions below. A6.4.4.3.2.  UNCLASSIFIED//FOUO  –  At  a  minimum  this  should  be  used  for  any products  and  responses  that  contain  pre-decisional,  policy  draft  or  other  sensitive   48  HOI33-3  6 JULY 2015 information that has not  received final  approval or directive from leadership.  It can also be used at the discretion of the originating (or owning) office for items deemed deserving  of  (For  Official  Use  Only  (FOUO)  status  by  leadership  within  their organization.    Once  selected  the  task  becomes  private  and  only  visible  to  those involved in the task. A6.4.4.3.3.  UNCLASSIFIED//FOUO//PRIVACY ACT INFORMATION – To be used in all situations when individually identifying info is held as part of the tasker text or within  the  originating  documents.    Examples  include  anything  containing  SSNs, phone numbers, personal addresses, birth dates, medical info, etc.  Once selected the task becomes private and only visible to those involved in the task. A6.4.4.3.4.  UNCLASSIFIED//FOUO//LAW  ENFORCEMENT  SENSITIVE  –  To  be used in situations when law enforcement related info is held as part of the tasker text or within the originating documents.  The marking is intended to denote that the info was  compiled  for  law  enforcement  purposes  and  should  be  afforded  appropriate safeguarding  in  order  to  protect  certain  legitimate  government  interests,  including, among  others,  the  protection  of  enforcement  proceedings;  the  right  of  a  person  to  a fair  trial  or  an  impartial  adjudication;  personal  privacy  including  records  about individuals  requiring  protection  under  the  Privacy  Act.    Once  selected  the  task becomes private and only visible to those involved in the task. A6.4.4.3.5.  UNCLASSIFIED//UCNI  –  DoD  Unclassified  Controlled  Nuclear Information (UCNI) is unclassified information on security measures for the physical protection  of  DoD  Special  Nuclear  Material  equipment,  or  facilities.    Once  selected the task becomes private and only visible to those involved in the task. A6.4.4.4.  Priority:  Tasking priorities are used subordinate to suspense deadlines.  When multiple tasks are due simultaneously, the Tasker Priority is used to focus attention and resources to higher priority deliverables passing between HAF/ES, directorate executive support staffs and action officers.  Priority definitions are as follows: A6.4.4.4.1.  HOT:    Only  used  on  newly  emerging  Top  4  task  (or  higher  leadership) requiring immediate attention for timely response.  Default suspense for a HOT task is 48 hrs on weekdays or 2 duty days when crossing weekends. A6.4.4.4.2.  Priority  1:    Assigned  to  all  actions  requiring  SAF/OS  and  AF/CC  for Sign/Appr  as  well  as  all  actions  (Sign,  Appr,  or  Info)  to  higher  levels  of  DoD  or civilian leadership. A6.4.4.4.3.  Priority 2:  Assigned to all actions to SAF/OS and AF/CC for Info and all Sign/Appr  items  for  SAF/US,  AF/CV  and  CVA.    Also  available  at  directorate  level for internal task.

Additional  information  on  the  recipient  (SecAF,  CSAF,  etc.)  can  be  found  in  the  My Instructions portion of the tasker data. A6.4.4.4.7.13.  Source: A6.4.4.4.7.13.1.  Internal:  Final action is within the HAF A6.4.4.4.7.13.2.  External:  Final action is external to HAF (including MAJCOMs) A6.4.4.4.7.14.  My  Instructions:    My  Instructions  section  will  include  a  brief  task summary  and  label  as  shown  below.    Also,  include  the  recommended  deliverables,  i.e., Prepare SSS fully coordinated with memo for SecAF signature.  OCR information is also included in this area, i.e., OCR:  SAF/IE, AF/A3.  These are the minimum recommended OCRs; the OPR determines OCRs required based on the task and recommendation.           Task Summary: Deliverable: OCR(s): A6.4.4.4.8.  Other blocks on the ‘General’ tab: A6.4.4.4.8.1.  ‘Is Private’  Controls visibility of task to only those in the routing chain or with access to the assigned TMT Organization accounts.

Acceptance,  rejection,  or  transfer.    Timing  limitations  and  responsibilities  for  these changes are covered in section 2.2.  Specifics on how to Accept/Reject a Tasker using TMT is provided in TMT > Training Library > How 2s > How to Accept or Reject a Tasker. A6.6.  Assigning AO and TMT Coordination Process. A6.6.1.  In TMT the process to pass a task down an organization to an AO (person or Org) or assign OCRs is the same. A6.6.2.  Each level (2-Letter, 3-Letter, etc) may exchange tasks at equivalent levels.  If a 3-Letter tasks a 2-Letter for coordination, expect the 2-Letter to reject the task. A6.6.3.  In TMT, use the Manage Assignment function.   Specifics on using this function are located  in  TMT  >  Training  Library  >  How  2s  >  How  to  Manage  Assignments.    You  may assign  an  OPR  (within  a  2-Letter)  along  with  the  OCRs  (other  2-Letters)  to  expedite  the process and make the 2-Letter aware of pending coordination required. A6.6.3.1.  When  assigning  a  suspense,  the  suspense  selected  should  allow  the  OPR  to meet the overall task suspense back to the originator. A6.6.3.2.  HAF does not use the For Release or For Response functions. A6.7.  Finalizing/closing/completing a TMT. A6.7.1.  For HAF/ES and OPR assigned taskers: A6.7.1.1.  Use  the  TMT  Complete  Tasker  function.    General  instructions  are  located  in TMT at TMT > Training Library > How 2s > How to Enter Your Response and Complete a Tasker. A6.7.1.2.  Final responses to tasks are input in the ‘My Response’ tab of the TMT.  For tasks that will flow through HAF/ES to the Glass Doors for action or information, an SSS is built in ‘My Response’ per Chapter 3.0. A6.7.1.3.  All documents required for the TMT are located in “Tabs.” A6.7.2.  For 2-Letter developed taskers requiring Glass Door action or information: A6.7.2.1.  2-Letters will use the “FINAL COORD” process to route tasks to HAF/ES for Glass Door coordination and completion. A6.7.2.2.  The  TMT  FINAL  COORD  process  is  described  in  TMT  at  TMT  >  Training Library > How 2s > How to Start Final Coord. A6.7.2.3.  Using this process changes the ‘My Response’ tab to ‘SSS’ automatically. A6.7.2.4.  Using  this  method  does  not  allow  OCRs  to  upload  documents  to  the  Tab section so OCRs will have to load any additional documents to public workspace. A6.7.3.  To  finalize  a  TMT  and  close  a  TMT  task,  describe  the  action  taken  in  ‘My Response’ and upload applicable documents including a final version of signed documents. A6.8.  Extension requests. A6.8.1.  Extension requests will only be accepted via TMT IAW Section 2.3. A6.8.2.  The TMT Extension process is described in TMT at TMT > Training Library > How 2s > How to Request a Suspense Extension.
