Purpose.  AF  studies  are  conducted  to  gain  insights  into  complex  issues  and  to  inform leadership decisions.  This instruction provides guidance on the management and registration of AF  studies  in  accordance  with  the  Studies  Registry  Program  (SRP).    The  SRP  provides  a standardized process to identify, register, track, and share AF study efforts.  The objective of the SRP  is  to  increase  visibility,  transparency,  and  sharing  of  study  efforts  across  the  AF.    This instruction  defines  the  term  study  and  describes  contracted  and  non-contracted  studies.    This instruction then provides guidance on the management and registration of AF studies.  Templates are  provided  to  assist  study  leads  in  creating  study  plans  and  following  a  logical  and  rigorous study process. 1.2.  Study Definition.  For the purposes of this instruction, a study is defined as “A deliverable to  decision  makers  and  stakeholders  resulting  from  organized  analyses,  assessments,  or evaluations  conducted  in  support  of  policy  development,  decision  making,  management,  or administration.”  Not  all  analysis  and  assessment  efforts  constitute  a  study.    This  definition implies  a  process,  with  a  defined  start  and  end  date  that  involves  creating  a  deliverable  in response to, or in anticipation of, a decision maker’s request for analytical decision support.  This definition also implies a more involved process and product development than what is required for typical staff work (e.g., data queries, requests for information, staff packages). 1.3.  Study  Examples.  Types  of  AF  analysis  and  assessment  efforts  that  constitute  a  study,  or inform  a  study,  include,  but  are  not  limited  to:  Strategic  Analysis,  Force  Structure  Analysis, Resources, Recapitalization, Modernization, and Investment Analysis, Strategic and Operational Assessments, Capabilities-Based Assessments (CBA), Analysis of Alternatives (AoA), Business Case Analysis (BCA), and Manpower Studies, in addition to many unnamed type of analysis and assessment efforts. 1.4.  Contracted Studies.  For the purposes of this instruction, contracted studies are funded and coded using one of the following designated Advisory and Assistance Services (A&AS) Studies, Analyses and Evaluations (SAE) Element of Expense/Investment Codes (EEICs): 50610, 50611, 50620,  50621,  50670,  50671,  50672,  and  50673.    Note:  Contracted  Studies  obligated  in  the Defense  Enterprise  Accounting  and  Management  System  (DEAMS)  must  use  the  following Object  Class  Codes  (OCC):  2511101,  2511102,  2511111,  2511112,  2511103,  2511104, 2511113, and 2511114. 1.4.1.  Exemptions.  This  instruction  is  not  intended  to  include  contracted  engineering  and system architecture and design efforts as part of weapon systems management and oversight A&AS  Engineering  and  Technical  Services  EEICs:  50650,  50651,  50660,  50661,  50662, 50678,  50679,  50680  and  50681.    Note:  These  EEICs  correspond  to  the  following  OCCs respectively: 2513101, 2513102, 2513111, 2513112, 2513113, 2513103, 2513104, 2513115, and 2513114.  Also, this instruction is not intended to include contracted efforts coded with existing  EEICs/OCCs  required  by  other  policy  or  legislation  (e.g.,  contract  engineering services EEIC 532XX, or contract environmental services EEIC 534XX). 1.5.  Non-Contracted  Studies.  Non-contracted  studies,  also  referred  to  as  organic  studies,  are accomplished with in-house AF military and civilian resources.   4  AFI90-1603  31 DECEMBER 2015 Chapter 2 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.

Ensure SRP database entries are accurate, up-to-date, and available to SRP users. 2.3.  Assistant  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  for  Financial  Management  and  Comptroller (SAF/FM)  will:  Assist requesting organizations with  the completion of the Study  Registration Verification form (See paragraph 3.8) and all other required documentation necessary to process a funding request or Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR) when using one of the designated EEICs/OCCs. 2.4.  HAF Two-Letter organizations, Major Commands (MAJCOM), and Direct Reporting Units  (DRU).  Each  organization  must  implement  process  controls  to  ensure  that  studies sponsored  by  their  organization  are  identified  and  registered.  (T-1).    Each  organization  is  also responsible for: 2.4.1.  Certification  Authority  (CA).  Each  HAF  two-letter,  MAJCOM  vice  commander, and DRU commander is designated as their organizational Certification Authority.  The CA for  Field  Operating  Agencies  (FOA)  is  the  CA  of  their  parent  organization.    Each  CA  is authorized  to  delegate  their  CA  authority  and  actions  within  their  organization  as  they determine  most  beneficial,  efficient,  and  effective.    The  CAs  are  accountable  for  the  SRP AFI90-1603  31 DECEMBER 2015   5  compliance,  but  day-to-day  execution  of  those  assigned  tasks  can  be  delegated  as  the  CAs see fit.  Each CA or their delegated representative will: 2.4.1.1.  Review  all  contract  study  proposals  to  ensure  registration  and  due  diligence requirements are met. (T-1). 2.4.1.2.  Approve all contracted study efforts. (T-1). 2.4.2.  SRP  Point  of  Contact  (POC).  Each  HAF  two-letter  organization,  MAJCOM,  and DRU will identify and assign a primary SRP POC for SRP administrative activities on behalf of the organization. (T-1).   SRP POC will: 2.4.2.1.  Ensure  timely  and  accurate  registration  of  studies  for  their  organization.  (T-1).  SRP POCs can elect to register all study information for each study or designate another individual directly associated with the specific study (e.g., study director, study lead) to accomplish the registration. 2.4.2.2.  Coordinate  with  the  CA  to  record  the  CA  verification  and  approval  of  the contracted study in the SRP database. (T-1). 2.4.2.3.  Work with requesting organization and unit FM to ensure the correct EEIC/OCC for funding A&AS SAE contracted studies is used. (T-1). 2.4.2.4.  Review  their  organization’s  study  entries  to  ensure  they  are  updated  and accurate. (T-1). 2.4.2.5.  Coordinate  with  study  director  to  finalize  study  registration  for  completed studies (See paragraph 3.9). (T-1). 2.4.3.  Unit  FM  will:  Ensure  requesting  organizations  submit  a  completed  Study Registration  Verification  form  (See  paragraph  3.8)  with  all  other  required  documentation necessary and use one of the designated EEIC/OCCs to process a funding request or MIPR for A&AS SAE contracted studies. (T-1).  Should unit-level FM personnel detect the use of an EEIC/OCC not listed above to fund a study, they should have the requesting organization confirm  use  of  the  correct  EEIC/OCC  before  certifying  funding.  If  a  study  task  is  funded through an existing contract that is appropriately using a different EEIC/OCC, then a second line of accounting must be added using the appropriate designated study EEIC/OCC for the study task. (T-1). 2.5.  MAJCOM and Numbered Air Force (NAF) A9s may provide study-related functions that include, but are not limited to the following items: 2.5.1.  Lead  or  partner  with  appropriate  organizations,  as  required,  to  provide  quality, independent, objective, and relevant studies to inform their commander’s decisions. 2.5.2.  Lead  or  partner  with  appropriate  organizations  across  the  command,  as  required,  to establish  and  enforce  policies,  processes, and  protocols  for the  capture of,  retention  of,  and access to data needed to produce studies. 2.5.3.  Coordinate,  review,  and  advise  on  studies  forwarded  to  the  Commander,  Vice Commander, and external to the organization, as required. 2.5.4.  Provide support for the analytic aspects of this instruction, as requested.  For example, advise study leads across the command on following a study process (Attachment 2), creating   6  AFI90-1603  31 DECEMBER 2015 study  plans  (Attachments  3),  and  ensuring  analytical  rigor  (Attachment  4)  of  their  study efforts. 2.6.  Study Director.  The study director is responsible for providing study direction, oversight, and review for contracted and non-contracted AF studies.  The study director will: 2.6.1.  Work  with  the  SRP  POC  to  ensure  SRP  registration,  including  initial  study registration  to  final  registration  at  study  completion.  (T-1).   For  non-contracted  studies,  the study director may delegate this responsibility to the study lead. 2.6.2.  Work with SRP POC to obtain CA review and approval for contracted studies. (T-1). 2.6.3.  Provide study direction, oversight, and guidance to the study lead, as required. (T-1). 2.7.  Study Lead.  Study lead is the individual tasked to lead or conduct a non-contracted study.  In some cases, the study director may also fulfill the role of study lead.  The study lead should: 2.7.1.  Lead or conduct a study by following a logical study process (Attachments 2). 2.7.2.  Create a study plan prior to conducting the study (Attachment 3). 2.7.3.  Ensure the study is conducted with analytical rigor (Attachment 4). AFI90-1603  31 DECEMBER 2015   7  Chapter 3 STUDIES MANAGEMENT AND REGISTRATION 3.1.  Studies  Management  and  Registration.  The SRP provides  a management and oversight structure  for  AF  studies,  including  a  standardized  process  to  identify,  register,  track,  and  share AF study efforts.  The process starts with a requirement for a study and ends when the decision maker  and  stakeholders  receive  the  results  and  the  study  is  documented  and  closed  out  in  the SRP database. 3.2.  SRP  Database.  The  SRP  provides  a  studies  registry  database.    The  system  provides  all registered users with the capability to search the database for information on proposed, on-going, and  completed  studies.  The  SRP  database  is  available  on  an  unclassified  website  and  cannot accommodate classified material.  Normally, sufficient unclassified information is available on a proposed study to permit registration in the SRP database.  The study director will enter as much study  detail as  possible  for  classified  studies.  (T-1).    However,  the  SRP  POC  or  study  director should contact the SRP Support Team for guidance in the event that study registration cannot be accomplished  due  to  security  classification  issues.    The  SRP  database  is  located  at: https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/CSRP/. 3.3.  SRP  Implementation  Process.  Each  HAF  two-letter  organization,  MAJCOM,  and  DRU will establish, document, and implement CA-approved, internal processes suited to their mission in  order to ensure compliance with the SRP guidance. (T-1).   These processes should  facilitate the earliest possible identification of study requirements, the establishment of study priorities and approval,  and  an  evaluation  of  funding  sources  and  availability.    The  processes  should  include descriptions  of  how  the  following  SRP  requirements  are  met  for  each  study  effort:    Study Justification, Due Diligence, Study Registration, CA Approval, Study Registration Verification, and Study Completion. 3.4.  Study  Justification.  Study  directors  should  identify  and  confirm  the  source  of  the  study proposal or directive and document this in the SRP database.  Some common sources directing studies  are  Congressional,  Department  of  Defense  (DoD),  and  AF  policy  documents.    These sources  may  include,  but  are  not  limited  to:  National  Defense  Authorization  Act  (NDAA), Defense  Planning  Guidance  (DPG),  Resource  Management  Directives  (RMD),  Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), and AF Strategic Planning Guidance (SPG). 3.5.  Due  Diligence.  Due  diligence  is  the  action  taken  prior  to  embarking  upon  a  new  study effort  to  understand  if  the  study  is  duplicative  of  previously  completed  or  ongoing  studies.  Existing  study  efforts  may  help  to  limit  the  scope  or  completely  eliminate  the  need  for  a proposed  study.    Study  directors  and  study  leads  must  perform,  and  document  in  the  SRP database, the findings from a thorough search for related studies by searching available sources to include, but not limited to Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC), the SRP database, and  other  Federally  Funded  Research  and  Development  Center  (FFRDC)  and  think-tank databases (e.g., RAND). (T-1).  Study directors and study leads should also contact appropriate Subject-Matter  Experts  (SME)  to  gain  additional  information  related  to  the  study.    Note:  The effort  required  is  what  satisfies  the  CA  that  a  thorough  search  was  conducted  prior  to  study approval. to  assist  with  due  diligence  search: https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/CSRP/.   See  SRP  SharePoint  for  resources   8  AFI90-1603  31 DECEMBER 2015 3.6.  Study  Registration.  The study director or sponsoring organization’s SRP POC will begin initial study registration by entering information into as many of the registry fields as possible. (T-1).  Over time, as additional information becomes available, more of the registry fields should be  entered.    Study  directors,  in  conjunction  with  the  SRP  POC,  will  ensure  registration  of contracted and non-contracted studies according to the following guidance. (T-1). 3.6.1.  Contracted  Studies  Registration.  All  contracted  studies  must  be  registered  in  the SRP database and coded using one of the following designated A&AS SAE EEICs: 50610, 50611,  50620,  50621,  50670,  50671,  50672,  and  50673.  (T-1).    Note:  Contracted  Studies obligated in DEAMS must use the following OCCs: 2511101, 2511102, 2511111, 2511112, 2511103,  2511104,  2511113,  and  2511114.  In  the  event  that  one  of  the  eight,  designated EEIC/OCCs  above  is  used  for  a  contracted  effort  that  does  not  meet  the  study  definition  it must still be registered in the SRP database. (T-1).  However, the SRP registry allows for the entry to be designated as a “non-study” effort.  These cases may warrant a closer review by the  study  director  and  a  discussion  with  the  SRP  Support  Team  to  ensure  that  the  most appropriate EEIC/OCC is used.  If a study task is funded through an existing contract that is appropriately  using  a  different  EEIC/OCC,  then  unit  FM  must  add  a  second  line  of accounting using the appropriate designated study EEIC/OCC for the study task. (T-1). 3.6.1.1.  Exemptions.  This instruction is not intended to include contracted engineering and  system  architecture  and  design  efforts  as  part  of  weapon  systems  management  and oversight  A&AS  Engineering  and  Technical  Services  EEICs:  50650,  50651,  50660, 50661,  50662,  50678,  50679,  50680  and  50681.    Note:  These  EEICs  correspond  to  the following OCCs respectively: 2513101, 2513102, 2513111, 2513112, 2513113, 2513103, 2513104,  2513115,  and  2513114.    Also,  this  instruction  is  not  intended  to  include contracted  efforts  coded  with  existing  EEICs/OCCs  required  by  other  policy  or legislation  (e.g.,  contract  engineering  services  EEIC  532XX,  or  contract  environmental services EEIC 534XX). 3.6.2.  Non-Contracted  Studies  Registration.  Non-contracted  studies,  also  referred  to  as organic  studies,  are  accomplished  with  in-house  AF  military  and  civilian  resources.    Study directors, study leads, and SRP POCs are encouraged to register non-contracted studies in the SRP  database  to  help  reduce  duplication  of  effort  and  increase  awareness  of  AF  studies.  Additionally, analysts may register an analysis or assessment effort that may not be deemed a study, as defined in this instruction, in order to increase awareness to the broader AF. 3.7.  CA  Approval.  The study director will work with the SRP POC to  obtain CA review and approval  for  contracted  studies.  (T-1).    The  organization’s  SRP  POC  will  document  the  CA approval by entering the CA’s name in Certifying Authority Name field in the SRP database (T-1). 3.8.  Study Registration Verification.  A unit’s FM will ensure a completed Study Registration Verification form accompanies all requests for the funding of A&AS SAE contract studies. (T-1).    SRP  POCs  will  generate  the  Study  Registration  Verification  form  from  each  SRP  entry’s main page. (T-1).  The completion of all data fields on the verification form is mandatory.  The verification  form  is  automatically  populated  from  the  SRP  data  entry  fields.    The  verification form can be downloaded or electronically transferred as appropriate. AFI90-1603  31 DECEMBER 2015   9  3.9.  Study  Completion.  At  the conclusion  of  a  study, the study  director,  in  coordination  with the  SRP  POC,  completes  study  registration,  provides  actual  costs,  and  archives  the  study,  as required. 3.9.1.  Finalize  SRP  Registration.  Upon  study  completion,  the  study  director  will  work with  the  SRP  POC  to  ensure  the  remaining  SRP  database  fields  are  completed.  (T-1).  Studies  crossing  multiple  years  do  not  require  subsequent  registration  and  CA  approval.  However, when registering a contracted study, an estimate of the per year study cost should be  allocated  across  the  active  years  of  the  study.    The  entry  should  be  updated  with  actual costs annually and at study completion. 3.9.2.  Provide  Cost  Estimates.  The  study  director  will  ensure  cost  estimates  are  included on the front cover of each study that meets the DoD cost guidance criteria listed on the DoD Cost Guidance Portal: https://www.cape.osd.mil/CostGuidance/. (T-0). 3.9.3.  Archive  Study.  Study  director  will  ensure  studies  are  archived  with  DTIC,  as required,  per  Department  of  Defense  Manual  (DoDM)  3200.14,  Volume  1,  Principles  and Operational  Parameters  of  the  DoD  Scientific  and  Technical  Information  Program  (STIP), 14  March  2014.  (http://www.dtic.mil/dtic).  (T-1).    Note:  Study  directors  will  also  ensure studies are archived in service specific  or joint repositories, as  required, per existing policy and legislation governing those study types.  (T-1).

However, for the purposes of this instruction, analysis is defined as  “A  process  of  defining  and  scoping  problems,  synthesizing  information,  and  applying qualitative  and  quantitative  (e.g.,  mathematical,  statistical,  data-driven)  methods  with  the purpose of informing leadership decisions.” Assessment—  For  the  purposes  of  this  instruction,  assessment  is  defined  as  “A  process  that supports  decision  making  by  measuring  the  ability  to  accomplish  a  task,  create  a  condition,  or achieve  an  objective.”    Said  another  way,  the  assessment  process  seeks  evidence  to  reach  a conclusion  about  some  characteristic  of  an  entity  (e.g.,  AF  members  conducting  operational assessments  seek  to  collect  data  (evidence)  to  understand  the  success  (characteristic)  towards achieving military objectives (entity)). Certification Authority (CA)— The designated position within an organization responsible for reviewing  and  approving  study  proposals  to  ensure  full  compliance  with  SRP  requirements. Current  SRP  guidance  identifies  the  MAJCOM  Vice  Commander,  the  DRU  Commanders  and the HAF two-letters as the designated CA for their respective organizations to include reporting Field Operating Agencies. Contracted  Study—  Contracted  studies  are  funded  and  coded  using  one  of  the  following designated A&AS SAE EEICs: 50610, 50611, 50620, 50621, 50670, 50671, 50672, and 50673. Note:  Contracted  Studies  obligated  in  the  Defense  Enterprise  Accounting  and  Management System  (DEAMS)  must  use  the  following  Object  Class  Codes  (OCC):  2511101,  2511102, 2511111, 2511112, 2511103, 2511104, 2511113, and 2511114. Due  Diligence— A systematic search for existing information related to the proposed study, to include a literature search of data repositories and inquiries with Subject-Matter Experts (SME) which could, in whole or in part, satisfy the proposed study objectives. Element of Expense/Investment Code (EEIC)— A five-digit alphanumeric code consisting of two  parts:  a  three-digit  account  code  followed  by  a  two-digit  subaccount  code  to  provide  a further shred-out. The codes are designed for use in budget preparations and accounting systems to  identify  the  nature  of  services  and  items  acquired  for  immediate  consumption  (expense)  or capitalization (investment). EEICs are used as part of the accounting classification in accounting for  commitment,  obligation,  disbursement,  collection,  and  international  balance  of  payment transactions.  EEICs  identify  the  nature  of  services  and  items  acquired  for  immediate consumption  or  capitalization.  (Also  known  as  an  Air  Force  Element  of  Expense/Investment Code  (AFEEIC)).    Source  data  on  EEICs  can  be  found  at  the  Financial  Management  Data Quality Service (FMDQS): https://fmdd.affsc.af.mil/data-elements/home Non-Contracted  Study—  Non-contracted  studies,  also  referred  to  as  organic  studies,  are accomplished with in-house AF military and civilian resources. Object  Class  Code  (OCC)—  Object  classes  are  categories  that  represent  obligations  by  the items or services purchased by the Federal Government.  An OCC is a seven-digit alphanumeric consisting  of  two  parts:  a  three-digit  object  class  followed  by  a  four-digit  sub  account  code  to provide  a  further  shred-out.    Source  data  on  OCCs  can  be  found  at  the  Financial  Management Data Quality Service (FMDQS): https://fmdd.affsc.af.mil/data-elements/home AFI90-1603  31 DECEMBER 2015   13  Studies  Registry  Program  (SRP)—  Program  that  provides  management,  oversight,  and visibility over AF study efforts. Study—  A  deliverable  to  decision  makers  and  stakeholders  resulting  from  organized  analyses, assessments,  or  evaluations  conducted  in  support  of  policy  development,  decision  making, management, or administration. Study  Director—  The  individual  directly  responsible  for  providing  study  direction,  oversight, and review for contracted and non-contracted AF studies. Study  Lead—The  individual  tasked  to  lead  or  conduct  a  non-contracted  study.    Study  leads should create study plans, follow a logical study process, and ensure study results are analytically rigorous.    14  AFI90-1603  31 DECEMBER 2015 Attachment 2 STUDY PROCESS A2.1.  Study Process.  Quality studies require the skill, knowledge, experience, and creativity of the  study  lead  to  thoughtfully  apply  the  scientific  method  and  critical  thinking  to  the  decision problem.  This framework serves to guide the study lead to conduct a study.  While the activities are  presented  in  a  logical  order,  it  may  be  necessary  to  perform  steps  in  parallel  or  redo  prior steps multiple times as the study progresses.  This template is not directive, and where no other study guidance exists, organizations and analysts are encouraged to tailor this template to meet the needs of their organization and analytic effort. A2.2.  Understand  the  Requirement.  What  decision  is  being  supported?  When  is  the information  needed?  What  questions  are  being  answered?    Know  who  is  asking  and  who  will receive  the  results.    Know  their  desires  in  the  broader  context  and  what  is  being  tasked.    Ask questions  until  these  areas  become  clear  enough  to  confidently  move  forward  to  document  the problem in a study plan. A2.3.  Develop  a  Study  Plan.  A  major  benefit  of  the  study  plan  is  that  it  helps  the  analyst  to focus  and  critically  think  about  the  problem  and  how  the  study  will  be  conducted  before  data collection  and  analysis  efforts  begin.    The  study  plan  provides  common  agreement  on  the problem,  the  approach  to  solve  the  problem,  and  the  expected  deliverable,  milestones,  and resources needed to accomplish the study effort.  See Attachment 3 for Study Plan template. A2.4.  Collect  and  Process  Data.  Data requirements are determined after framing and scoping the  decision  problem.    Data  is  often  costly  and  time  consuming  to  locate,  obtain,  process,  and fully understand.  Determine best sources and ensure data is current.  In cases where data doesn’t exist, it may need to be collected through surveys or experimentation using sampling or Design of  Experiments  techniques.    After  collecting  the  data,  the  analyst  processes  the  data  by examining  it,  scrutinizing  its  quality,  cleansing  it  (e.g.,  identifying  and  correcting  or  removing inaccurate,  incomplete,  or  duplicated  data),  and  organizing  it  into  a  useable  format.    Use exploratory  data  analysis  techniques  (e.g.,  summary  statistics,  graphical  analysis)  to  fully understand  the  data.    After  the  data  is  processed  and  understood,  it  is  then  ready  to  be  further analyzed or used in modeling efforts. A2.5.  Perform  Analysis.    The  analyst  needs  to  thoughtfully  apply  the  scientific  method  and critical thinking.  This includes determining the appropriate analysis tools, techniques, and rigor that  will  be  applied  after  the  problem  has  been  well-defined  and  the  data  has  been organized.    This  step  is  where  the  majority  of  the  study  plan  is  executed  (e.g.,  run  models, analyze  results,  conduct  excursions).    After  the  initial  results  are  produced,  the  analyst  is encouraged  to  understand  and  quantify  the  uncertainty  and  sensitivity  of  the  results  where appropriate.    This  includes  calculating  interval  estimates  (e.g.,  confidence  interval  around  an average),  exploring  outputs  visually (e.g.,  histograms,  box  plots),  understanding  the underlying probability distributions, and exploring sensitivity of the results and assumptions (e.g., scenario analysis, break-even analysis, tornado charts). A2.6.  Peer  Review.  It  is  highly  recommended  that  analysts  and  SMEs  peer  review  the  study plan and results early and periodically throughout the study.  The benefits of this review process are  to  ensure  the  analytical  rigor  of  the  results,  to  foster  collaboration,  to  protect  the  findings AFI90-1603  31 DECEMBER 2015   15  from  political  agendas,  and  to  promote  growth  in  the  analyst  by  learning  from  peers.    See Attachment 4 on Analytical Rigor for the kinds of questions to be considered during peer-review. A2.7.  Interpret  and  Present  Analysis  Results.    A  final  step,  which  is  a  critical  part  of  the process, is interpreting and presenting insights relevant to  the supported decision.   Outstanding analysis is often ignored if poorly presented.  An analyst needs to understand the audience and the  best  way  to  convey  the  key  concepts  of  the  analysis  to  the  audience.    The  analyst  should convey  the “so  what?” of  the  research  and  also  “tell  the  story”  of  what  it  means  to  the  overall effort. A2.8.  Document  and  Archive  Data,  Methodology,  and  Study.   A  gold-standard documentation and archival process allows reproducible results.  Include all documentation and data to support follow-on questions and future research.  The study plan serves as a great starting point to document the final results.  This documentation should also include a maintenance plan to  maintain  software,  data,  and  models.    Complete  data  archival  includes  the  raw  data,  the processed data, a data dictionary describing the variables and their values, and the documentation describing how the raw data was processed.  This step also includes finalizing SRP registration and archiving the study (e.g., DTIC) as required.    16  AFI90-1603  31 DECEMBER 2015 Attachment 3 STUDY PLAN A3.1.  Study  Plan.  The goal of a study plan (or project plan, analysis plan, etc.) is to help the study  lead  think  through  the  decision  problem  prior  to  processing  data  and  starting  analytic efforts.    Clearly  defining  the  problem  is  the  most  important  step  of  conducting  a  study  and thoughtful effort here helps ensure analysts provide insights that decision makers need in an open and transparent way.  This template is not directive, and where no other study guidance exists, organizations  and  analysts  are  encouraged  to  tailor  this  template  to  meet  the  needs  of  their organization and analytic effort. A3.2.  Background.  Provide sufficient background knowledge.  Why is this study being done?  What are the key issues and concerns?  Who asked the question?  Who are the stakeholders and what are their needs?  What decision does this analysis support?  Who would make the decision?  When and in what forum would they make the decision? A3.3.  Define  Problem,  Study  Objectives/Questions,  and  Metrics.  Problem  definition  is  the most critical step in any study.  It should be as specific and concrete as possible.  Consider the decision problem various ways and from multiple perspectives before settling on final wording, and then expect to revise it.  Once  the decision problem is initially understood, provide a clear statement of the problem and any supporting study objectives, questions, and metrics. A3.4.  Scope.  Describe what will  be studied and what will not.   Consider what can be done in the timeframe provided. A3.5.  Facts,  Assumptions,  Constraints,  and  Limitations.  List  the  facts,  assumptions, constraints, and limitations affecting study design and results.  If known, be explicit about biases or second-order effects that result from study constraints and limitations. A3.6.  Review  and  Document  Previous  Findings.  A  due  diligence  search  may  have  been performed  prior  to  starting  the  study  to  understand  if  the  study  is  duplicative  of  previously completed or ongoing studies.  After the decision was made to start a new study, the analyst may need to conduct a more thorough literature review to research other study efforts and analytical methods  that  address  this  or  similar  problems.    How  is  this  problem  similar  and  different?  Document any relevant findings and references.   Note:  If this step will take significant time to complete, it can be accomplished as a step in the study process after the study plan is approved. A3.7.  Study  Design  and  Modeling  Approach.  Detail  how  any  hypotheses  will be  evaluated, what experiments will be performed, and what models, algorithms, and analytical techniques will be used to model the problem. A3.8.  Data  Collection  and  Processing.  Detail  what  data  is  needed.    Detail  how  data  will  be collected and processed. A3.9.  Expected  End  Product  and  Final  Results.  This  section  illustrates  the  expected  end product and final results.  This section allows the analyst and decision maker to create a vision for any deliverables.  What does a successful end product look like?  What form does the product take (e.g., report, dashboard)?  Does this deliverable answer the defined problem? A3.10.  Milestones  and  Deliverables.  Detail  the  phases  of  the  study  effort  (e.g.,  Gantt  chart).  What events mark progress in this effort?  Follow a logical study process (Attachment 2) to think AFI90-1603  31 DECEMBER 2015   17  through these steps.  Who needs the results and by when?  Is there coordination that must occur during or after the study? A3.11.  Study Team.  List study team participants (e.g., analysts, stakeholders, SME), and detail their roles.  Detail how the team will work together to accomplish the study. A3.12.  Resource Requirements.  Identify other resources needed to accomplish the study (e.g., other  personnel,  money,  computers,  software).    What  Temporary  Duties  (TDY)  are  required?  Are there any security requirements to account for (e.g., security clearances, access to classified hardware/infrastructure)?  Due to their critical and time-consuming nature, security requirements must be identified and worked early in the study process. A3.13.  Terms and Definitions.  List relevant terms and definitions.    18  AFI90-1603  31 DECEMBER 2015 Attachment 4 ANALYTICAL RIGOR A4.1.  Overview.  Study leads may use these criteria and questions to assist them in producing an analytically rigorous study, which will usually be accomplished by following a logical study process  (Attachment  2)  and  creating  a  study  plan  (Attachment  3).    However,  study  directors, supervisors,  and  decision  makers  may  also  use  these  criteria  and  questions  to  assist  them  in reviewing or coordinating on a study.  The intent of evaluating a study for analytical rigor is to gain insights into the study process and to  evaluate  that the results reflect an honest  attempt  to deliver  unbiased,  analytically  sound  insights  to  the  decision  maker.    Reviewing  a  completed study  for  analytical  rigor  after  the  fact  is  the  least  desirable  option.    Analytical  rigor  is  best achieved  when  a  study  is  designed  with  these  principles  and  reviewed  periodically  throughout the  process.    This  template  is  not  directive,  and  where  no  other  guidance  exists,  organizations and  analysts  are  encouraged  to  tailor  these  criteria  to  meet  the  needs  of  the  analytic  effort  in development or under review. A4.2.  Problem Statement Properly Scoped and Well-Defined.  The purpose and objectives of the  analytic effort  should  be  clearly  stated.   What  is  the  purpose  of  this  study?   What  decision does  it  inform?    How  are  the  results  to  be  used?    What  are  the  goals  and  objectives?    Do  the study results answer the study questions and objectives? A4.3.  Key Stakeholders Participated.  The level of participation may give an indication of the completeness of the study.  Who is  the target  audience?  Who are the stakeholders affected by this analysis?  Were the appropriate organizations and stakeholders included in the study?  What other  agencies  and  organizations  were  involved?   Was  this an  AF-only  study  or  a  Joint  effort?  Which organizations contributed to which parts of the effort? A4.4.  Problem  Researched.  What  kind  of  literature  search  (and/or  due  diligence  search)  was performed prior to conducting analysis?  Was previous analysis done in this area?  How did this research influence the study design or chosen methodology? A4.5.  Facts,  Assumptions,  Constraints,  and  Limitations  Explicitly  Stated.  Most  analytical methodologies  require  assumptions  when  facts  are  not  known.    These  assumptions  need  to  be explicit  and  justified.    What  were  some  of  the  major  facts,  assumptions,  constraints,  and limitations  that  influenced  the  study  design  and  results?    What  weaknesses,  biases,  or  second-order  effects  resulted  from  any  assumptions,  constraints,  and  limitations  and  how  were  they overcome? A4.6.  Available Data Collected and Processed.  Where did the data come from?  How good is it?  How current is it?  What kind of processing was needed to get the data useable?  How was missing data handled?  How were outliers handled? A4.7.  Appropriate  Analytical  Methodologies  and  Tools  Chosen.  There  are  often  multiple approaches to solve a problem, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.  What analytical methodology and/or tools were used to answer the problem?  Why was this method and/or tool chosen?    Has  the  analyst  used  it  before?    What  are  the  strengths  and  weaknesses  of  this methodology  and/or  tool?    How  did  the  analyst  overcome  the  weakness  of  the  methodology and/or tool?  What is pedigree of the model and does it have appropriate Verification, Validation, and Accreditation (VV&A)? AFI90-1603  31 DECEMBER 2015   19  A4.8.  Alternatives  Evaluated  Objectively.  Were  various  alternatives,  or  Courses  of  Action (COA),  considered?    What  alternatives  were  discarded  and  why?    What  criteria  were  used  to distinguish  among  the  alternatives?    If  the  status  quo  was  the  chosen  alternative,  does  it  best meet the objectives and values of the decision problem? A4.9.  Uncertainty  Quantified.  Was  uncertainty  quantified?    Were  data  distributions  created?  Do the results include confidence  intervals in addition to the point estimates?  How variable is the input and output data? A4.10.  Sensitivity Analysis  Performed.  Was sensitivity analysis conducted on the results and assumptions?  Which factors drive the output of the process and model the most and least? A4.11.  Results Peer-Reviewed.  Peer review is an important part of ensuring analytical rigor of the study process and results.  Were the results peer reviewed?  What was the feedback from the peer review?  What changes were made as a result of the peer review? A4.12.  Data,  Methodology,  and  Study  Documented  and  Archived.  Have  the  data, methodology,  and  study  been  documented  and  archived  in  a  way  that  an  independent organization or analyst would be able to reproduce the study results?
