(T-3) 3.8.2.  Crews  will,  at  a  minimum,  check  the  following  items  during  Ops  Checks:  route, environment, verification of access, and terrain. (T-3) 3.9.  On Station/Off Station.  Crews will be prepared for mission execution and are expected to be  on  station  at  the  beginning  of  the  TOT/T,  and  will  be  off  station  by  the  end  of  the  TOT/T, unless circumstances occur which are beyond crew control. (T-3) 3.10.  Vulnerability (VUL) Window.  Crews are bounded by the vulnerability (VUL) window. Deviations  from  the assigned VUL  window will  be coordinated through the Crew Commander and approved by the tasking authority. (T-3) 3.11.  Abort/Knock-it-off.  A tactical commander may declare a knock-it-off (training use only) or abort (cease action/event/mission). (T-3) 3.12.  Dynamic  Targeting.  Ad  hoc  and/or  emerging  target  tasking  can  occur.  During  tasked missions,  an  operator  may  identify  and  report  something  that  may  require  ad  hoc  or  dynamic targeting/re-tasking. Dynamic re-tasking allows modification of the mission to support changing mission  objectives.  This  includes  everything  from  re-tasking  the  operator  within  the  mission requirements to an entirely new mission that is added to the current tasking order. (T-3) 3.13.  Communications  and  Crew  Coordination.  Recorded  crew  communications  represent official  communications,  and  crewmembers  should  be  aware  they  have  no  expectation  of privacy. Crews will use brevity codes as defined in SPINS to the maximum extent possible  (T-3). 3.14.  Communications. 3.14.1.  Mission execution requires at least one method of communication for all operations. (T-3) 3.14.2.  The Crew Commander is responsible for developing and briefing the communication plan.  Communications  planning  is  performed  to  determine  who  should  talk,  when,  and  via what medium. An Example Communications Planning Guide can be found in Attachment 4. (T-3) 3.14.3.  The  Crew  Commander  will  ensure  a  designated  crewmember  will  monitor  all primary communications, unless otherwise directed, during all phases of operations. (T-3) 3.15.  Mission  Report  (MISREP).  Tasking  authorities,  future  missions  and  debriefs  rely  on timely, accurate MISREPs. All MISREPs will be completed prior to debrief. (T-3) AFI17-2CSCSV3  16 MAY 2017 11 3.15.1.  The  Crew  Commander  is  responsible  for  providing  timely,  accurate  and  correctly formatted reports to the tasking authority. (T-3) 3.15.2.  A  MISREP  will  be  accomplished  once  the  cybercrew  completes  a  mission  or particular phase of the mission IAW guidance/tasking. (T-3) 3.15.3.  The Crew Commander will review the MISREP for accuracy and completeness, and submit to the tasking authority. (T-3) 3.15.4.  Each  crewmember  is  responsible  for  providing  the  appropriate  data  regarding  their mission area for the MISREP per local guidance. (T-3) 3.15.5.  Local procedures/templates may be developed to ensure standardization of reporting. (T-3) 3.16.  Crew  Changeover.  Crewmembers  from  the  off-going  and  on-coming  sorties  during  a multi-sortie  day  will  participate  in  a  crew  changeover  briefing.  Direct  crew  changeover  only applies  if  crews  are  performing  24/7  operations.  If  24/7  operations  are  not  occurring,  crew changeover briefings will be incorporated into the next pre-mission briefing. At a minimum, the changeover will include all items previously identified for the pre-mission briefing. (T-3) 3.17.  Debriefing. 3.17.1.  All missions will be debriefed. (T-3) 3.17.2.  The Crew Commander is responsible for leading the crew debrief (T-3). 3.17.3.  Debriefs  will  address  all  aspects  of  the  mission  (planning,  briefing  and  execution) and  ensure  all  participants  receive  feedback  through  the  development  of  Lessons  Learned (LL)  and  Learning  Points  (LP).    LL  and  LP  should  be  applied  as  soon  as  operationally feasible  (i.e.  implemented  in  training,  resulted  in  process  changes,  update  checklists,  etc.).  SQ/DO will determine a tracking process to insure LL and LP are implemented. (T-3) 3.17.4.  Debrief  will  address  crewmember  responsibilities,  de-confliction  contracts,  tactical employment priorities, and task management. (T-3) 3.17.5.  The Crew Commander will review the record of all tactical portions of the sortie to assess member effectiveness. (T-3) 3.17.6.  The debriefing should occur at multiple levels (e.g., crew debrief and team debrief) depending  on  the  mission  type  (i.e.,  single  ship,  large  force  employment).  The  debriefing guide is in Attachment 3.3.17.7. (T-3) 12 AFI17-2CSCSV3  16 MAY 2017 Chapter 4 CREW DUTIES, RESPONSIBILITIES AND PROCEDURES 4.1.  CSCS  Crew  Requirement.
