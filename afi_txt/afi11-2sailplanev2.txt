Conducting  Evaluations.  Units  will  conduct  all  evaluations  in  accordance  with  the provisions of AFI 11-202, Volume 2, Aircrew Standardization and Evaluation Program and this instruction.  (T-2). 1.2.  Procedures: 1.2.1.  Flight  examiners  (FE)  will  use  the  evaluation  criteria  contained  in  Chapter  3  for conducting flight and emergency procedures evaluations (EPE).  (T-2).  To ensure standard and  objective  evaluations,  each  FE  must  become  thoroughly  familiar  with  the  prescribed evaluation criteria.  (T-2). 1.2.2.  Conduct all evaluations in two-place sailplanes. (T-2).  Unless specified, the examinee will fly in the seat that best enables the FE to conduct a thorough evaluation.  (T-2).  The FE normally occupies the front seat during periodic instructor mission evaluations. 1.2.3.  Prior to the flight, the FE will brief the examinee on the purpose of the evaluation and how it will be conducted. (T-2).  The examinee accomplishes required flight planning during the evaluation and furnishes the FE a copy of necessary mission data, mission materials, and maps (as required). 1.2.4.  The FE will thoroughly debrief all aspects of the flight.  (T-2).  Debriefs include the examinee’s overall rating, specific deviations, area grades assigned (if other than qualified), and  any  required  additional  training.    The  FE  will  debrief  a  squadron  supervisor  after  all evaluations.    (T-2).    A  squadron  supervisor  must  attend  the  debrief  if  the  overall  grade  is Qualification Level 3 (Q-3).  (T-2). 1.2.5.  To  initially  qualify  as  an  instructor,  a  pilot  must  successfully  complete  a  dedicated initial  instructor  evaluation.    (T-2).    Subsequently,  crewmembers  designated  as  instructors will be evaluated on their ability to instruct during all periodic evaluations.  (T-2).  FEs will act as students for the purpose of evaluating the examinee’s instructional ability.  (T-2). 1.3.  Grading Instructions: 1.3.1.  Tolerances  in  performance  parameters  are  based  on  conditions  of  smooth  air  and stable  aircraft  conditions.  Momentary  deviations  from  tolerances  will  not  be  considered  in grading, provided the examinee applies prompt corrective action and such deviations do not jeopardize  flying  safety.  Consider  cumulative  deviations  when  determining  the  area  grade. Airspeed criteria are given in knots indicated airspeed (KIAS). 1.3.2.  FEs will use the evaluation criteria in  Table  3.1 to determine individual area grades.   (T-2).  When individual areas are performed well above the grading criteria standards, then make  an  appropriate  comment  stating  performance  and/or  instruction  was  commendable  in the  Examiner’s  Remarks  in  the  Comments  block  of  the  AF  Form  8,  Certificate  of  Aircrew Qualification or AF Form 8A, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification (Multiple Aircraft). (T-2).  FEs must exercise judgment when wording of areas is subjective and specific situations are not covered.  (T-2). AFI11-2SAILPLANEV2  30 APRIL 2015   5  1.3.3.  Derive  the  overall  flight  evaluation  grade  (Q-1,  Q-2,  or  Q-3)  from  the  area  grades, based on a composite of the observed events and tasks according to AFI 11-202, Volume 2, this instruction, and FE judgment.  (T-2). 1.3.4.  Critical areas must be accomplished.  (T-2).  If the examinee receives an unqualified grade in any critical area, the overall grade for the evaluation will be unqualified (Q-3).  (T-2).    Critical  areas  are  identified  by  "Critical"  in  the  area  title  in  Table  3.1.    Grade  critical areas as qualified ("Q") or unqualified ("U").  (T-2). 1.3.5.  The general evaluation criteria in Table 1.1 apply during all phases of flight (except as noted in Table 3.1 for specific events). Table 1.1.  General Evaluation Criteria.

With  the  exception  of  restrictions  and  exceptionally  qualified  designation  (if  used), place all comments on the reverse side of the AF Form 8 or AF Form 8A.  (T-2).   6  AFI11-2SAILPLANEV2  30 APRIL 2015 Chapter 2 EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS 2.1.  General.  There  are  four  types  of  sailplane  evaluations:  qualification  (QUAL),  mission (MSN), instructor (INSTR) and SPOT. Evaluations include requisites and required areas. Table 2.1  indicates  when  a  requisite  is  required  (R)  for  an  evaluation.  Table  2.2  prescribes  required areas that must be included in the flight evaluation profile.  (T-2).  Evaluation areas are aligned under the type of evaluation. 2.1.1.  Alternate Evaluation Methods.  Alternate evaluation methods are not authorized.  (T-2).  If the FE determines one or more of the required items cannot be adequately evaluated, the examinee must complete an additional flight to complete the evaluation.  (T-2). 2.1.2.  Publications  Check.  During  QUAL  evaluations,  the  FE  will  check  the  following publications during the evaluation: 2.1.2.1.  For  TG-15  evaluations:  TO  1G-15(T)-1CL-1,  Pilots’  Abbreviated  Flight  Crew Checklist,  USAF  Series  TG-15A/B  Sailplanes;  the  local  IFG,  and  the  advanced  soaring IFG (if certified).  (T-2). 2.1.2.2.  For  TG-16  evaluations:  TO  1G-16(T)-1CL-1,  Pilots’  Abbreviated  Flight  Crew Checklist,  USAF  Series  TG-16A  Sailplanes;  the  local  in-flight  guide  (IFG),  and  the advanced soaring IFG (if certified).  (T-2). 2.1.2.3.  When a periodic evaluation in one aircraft satisfies the evaluation requirements in another aircraft, check each set of publications.  (T-2). 2.2.  Requisites.  Table 2.1 indicates the minimum requisites for each type of evaluation. When periodic evaluations are combined, accomplish all requisites for each evaluation and document in the ground phase of the AF Form 8 or AF Form 8A.  (T-2).  When a periodic evaluation in one aircraft  satisfies  the  evaluation  requirements  in  another  aircraft,  requisite  examinations  may  be combined into a single exam. Table 2.1.  Evaluation Requisites. A I T  E  M 1  Open Book Exam Requisite 2  Closed Book Exam 3  Boldface Exam 4  EPE B C D QUAL MSN/INSTR SPOT   R R R R     R R 2.3.  Pilot (FP or MP) Evaluations.  All pilot evaluations are QUAL evaluations. The examinee briefs the sortie profile and flies from the front seat, center of gravity (CG) permitting. All MP and FP evaluations will include two sorties to accomplish Area 34, Simulated Rope Break. (T-2).  Periodic pilot evaluations may include either one or two sorties. Include all required areas from Table  2.2  in  the  flight  evaluation  profile.    (T-2).    The  examinee  will  perform  all  takeoffs  and AFI11-2SAILPLANEV2  30 APRIL 2015   7  landings.  (T-2).  A periodic QUAL evaluation in any sailplane may satisfy the periodic QUAL evaluation requirements in any sailplane so that only one periodic QUAL evaluation is required.  A  Requalification  (RQ)  QUAL  evaluation  in  any  sailplane  may  satisfy  the  RQ  evaluation requirements in any other sailplane such that only  one RQ evaluation  is required, provided the pilot was previously qualified in both sailplanes, and the approved RQ plan specifies that intent. 2.4.  Instructor    Pilot    (IP)    Evaluations.  Following  the  initial  MSN/INSTR  evaluation,  all periodic  IP  evaluations  are  combined  MSN,  QUAL,  and  INSTR  evaluations  to  evaluate  both proficiency  and  instructor  ability.  (T-2).    All  initial  instructor  evaluations  will  include  a minimum of two sorties, in order to accomplish Area 34, Simulated Rope Break. (T-2).  Periodic instructor evaluations may include either one or two sorties.  All IP evaluations will include all required  areas  from  Table  2.2  in  the  flight  evaluation  profile.    (T-2).    Units  will  publish evaluation  profiles  based  on  examinee  certifications  and  provide  mission  materials  suitable  for use as notional student training records.  (T-2).  The examinee determines the mission profile to accomplish  optimum  student  training  (based  on  mission  materials  provided)  and  all  required areas.  The  examinee  will  perform  a  takeoff  and  landing.    (T-2).    The  examinee  debriefs  the examiner after the sorties.  (T-2).  A periodic MSN evaluation in  any sailplane may satisfy the periodic  MSN  evaluation  requirements  in  any  sailplane  so  that  only  one  periodic  MSN evaluation  is  required.    A  RQ  MSN/INSTR  evaluation  in  any  sailplane  may  satisfy  the  RQ evaluation  requirements  in  any  other  sailplane  such  that  only  one  RQ  evaluation  is  required, provided  the  pilot  was  previously  qualified  in  both  sailplanes,  and  the  approved  RQ  plan specifies that intent.
