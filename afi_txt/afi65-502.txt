SUMMARY OF CORRECTIVE ACTIONS Recent changes include the removal of an exception related to the use of inflation indices when converting  fuel  and  pay  accounts  to  constant-year  dollars.  Paragraph  2.3.1  now  reflects  the standard practice. A comment clarifying the intent of Table A2.5 has also been added. SUMMARY OF CHANGES This  document  includes  the  following  modifications:  (1)  clarifies  the  inflation  index development process; (2) defines inflation and distinguishes it from other causes of price change (e.g., market forces); (3) clarifies that analysts are not required to use the inflation index as their forecasting  method.    Instead,  when  developing  then-year  cost  estimates,  analysts  should  use information  and  methodologies  that  have  the  highest  probability  of  accurately  estimating  the budget authority that will be required.  Subsequent to developing the then-year cost estimates, conversion between then-year and constant-year dollars will be performed using the current Air Force inflation indices (unless an exception is approved by OUSD(C)); (4) includes Attachments 2  and  3  highlighting  significant  changes  to  the  explanation  of  inflation  and  its  uses;  and  (5) deletes references to AFMC/FMC inflation data sheets and AFMC exemption routing.  1. 2.

Introduction.  Inflation  is  an  often  discussed  topic  which,  in  practice,  can  cause  much confusion.  In simplest terms, inflation is the increase in the general price level over time.  It is an average, which means that while most individual prices may rise (e.g., labor, cars, food, etc.), they may rise at different rates, and some prices may actually fall (e.g., technology).  Since not all  prices  increase  at  the  same  rate,  there  are  clearly  different  reasons  for  prices  to  change.  AFI65-502  13 MAY 2015   3  Inflation is only one of these reasons.  Other reasons prices may change include competition, the cost of factors of production, changes in quality, and changes in taxes and regulations.  These other  variables  also  alter  a  product’s  supply  and/or  demand  curves.    In  this  paragraph  and throughout this instruction, price is generically referred to as the payment (typically considered dollars) made in exchange for goods and services. 1.1.  Definition.  Inflation  is  defined  as  a  sustained  rise  in  the  general  price  level,  or  the proportionate rate of increase in the general price level per unit of time.1  The opposite of inflation is deflation, which is a decrease in the general price level. 1.2.  Background.  Inflation refers to the change in value of the currency  (e.g., the dollar) relative  to  all  other  goods.    If  the  general  price  level  is  rising,  then  the  same  number  of dollars buys fewer goods; therefore, the value of the dollar is decreasing.  The inflation index is intended to measure the decrease in the value of the dollar … nothing else.  Since the value of the dollar decreases from year to year, a dollar in one year is not the same as the dollar in another year.  “Normalizing” for inflation means applying the inflation index to cost data in order to remove the effect of inflation.  The result of normalizing is that all dollars, regardless of the year, will have the same value. 1.2.1.  Causes of Price Changes.  The price of a good or service can change for two broad categories  of  reasons:  (1)  inflation  (i.e.,  changes  in  the  value  of  the  dollar)  and  (2) changes  in  the  market  (i.e.,  supply  and  demand)  for  the  good  or  service.    For  this instruction, “Market changes” are changes in value that would occur even if all trade was done by barter (i.e., without the benefit of dollars or other currency). 1.2.1.1.  Cause of Inflation.  Inflation is usually caused by an increase in the money supply.  More specifically, inflation is caused by an increase in the volume of money and  credit  relative  to  available  goods2 resulting  in  a  rise  in  the  general  price  level.  When  the  money  supply  increases  at  a  faster  rate  than  the  number  of  goods  and services  available  for  purchase  in  the  economy,  the  result  is  usually  inflation.  Attachment  3,  section  A3.1,  provides  a  more  detailed  explanation  of  the  cause  of inflation. 1.2.1.2.  Market  Changes  (Supply  and  Demand).    Anything  that  moves  the  supply and/or demand curve for a good or service will change the equilibrium price for that good  or  service.    Examples  of  things  that  move  these  curves  include,  but  are  not limited  to:  productivity  increases;  technological  advances;  quality  changes;  cost  of inputs;  customer  preferences;  prices  of  complementary  or  substitute  goods;  patent expirations;  taxes  and  regulations.    Market  changes  are  important  since  they  can create changes in individual prices that are above or below the level of inflation. 1.2.1.2.1.  After  prices  are  normalized  (i.e.,  adjusted)  to  remove  inflation,  there may still be a change in price from one year to the next.  This price change that is not  due  to  inflation  is  referred  to  as  the  “real”  change  in  price,  because  it  no longer includes the distortion caused by the devaluation of the dollar.  Real price                                                  1 The MIT Dictionary of Modern Economics, Fourth Edition, edited by David Pearce, The MIT Press, Cambridge MA, 1992, p. 205. 2 For the purpose of this instruction, the term “available goods” refers to all goods and services for sale in the economy and, therefore, all the goods and services for which currency is demanded to purchase.   4  AFI65-502  13 MAY 2015 changes are caused by changes in the market for a good/service (i.e., actual, or real, changes in the economy). 1.2.2.  Effect of Inflation and Why It’s Important.  Changes in the value of the dollar (i.e., inflation)  distort  comparisons  of  prices  and  expenditures  over  time.    By  obscuring patterns  and  causes  of  cost  increases,  inflation  increases  the  difficulty  of  making appropriate  decisions.    Also,  planning  and  executing  programs  become  more  difficult when inflation is higher, less anticipated, and/or more volatile. 1.2.2.1.  Two examples of why considering inflation is important: 1.2.2.1.1.  Dollars spent in different years have different purchasing power due to inflation.  This makes it difficult to compare the cost of competing weapon system investments (with different obligation profiles) over time. 1.2.2.1.2.  Inflation  raises  the  difficulty  in  determining  the  cause  of  increasing costs and, consequently, in managing organizations and resources.  For example, when a commander sees supply costs increase from $100K to $110K in one year, he  or  she  will  likely  inquire  into  the  cause.    There  are  at  least  four  possible reasons  for  cost  growth,  each  requiring  different  corrective  action:  (1)  was inflation  10  percent,  (2)  did  the  unit  use  10  percent  more  supplies  because  of mission growth, (3) did the unit use 10% more supplies because they were less efficient, or (4) did the price of specific supplies (e.g., oil) increase?  Furthermore, the $10K increase could be a combination of reasons.  Clearly, the difficulty of the management process can be greatly affected by the amount and volatility of inflation. 1.2.3.  How the U.S. Government Sets Inflation Rates.  Three Executive Branch offices work together to develop economic forecasts for the current presidential administration to include  a  forecast  of  the  Gross  Domestic  Product  (GDP)  price  index:  the  Office  of Management and Budget (OMB), the Department of the Treasury, and the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA).  Federal agencies, including the Department of Defense, use the GDP price index forecast as the inflation forecast for planning purposes and when preparing budget documents. 1.2.3.1.  After  the  economic  forecasts  are  complete,  OMB  provides  the  inflation forecast to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) (OUSD(C)).  OUSD(C) then passes the inflation rates to the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force  for  Cost  and  Economics  (SAF/FMC),  who  in-turn  uses  the  inflation  rates  to calculate  the  Air  Force  inflation  indices.    SAF/FMC  converts  the  OSD  provided inflation rates to Air Force inflation indices using a standard mathematical procedure.  Therefore,  compliance  with  Air  Force  inflation  indices  is  equivalent  to  complying with the OUSD(C) inflation rates.  The Air Force inflation indices are produced and disseminated via the Air Force Portal for use by Air Force personnel. 2.  Inflation  Adjustment  Requirements.  OMB  Circular  A-11  requires  inflation  to  be considered in resource planning activities such as budget preparation, life-cycle cost estimates, etc.    OMB  Circular  A-94  provides  specific  guidance  on  inflation  assumptions.    It  defines inflation  as  “The  proportionate  rate  of  change  in  the  general  price  level,  as  opposed  to  the AFI65-502  13 MAY 2015   5  proportionate increase in a specific price.  Inflation is usually measured by a broad-based price index, such as the implicit deflator for Gross Domestic Product or the Consumer Price Index.”     6  AFI65-502  13 MAY 2015 In accordance with the OMB circulars, AFPD 65-5 mandates that SAF/FMC develop Air Force inflation indices. 2.1.  OUSD(C) provides three things to SAF/FMC: (1) inflation rates (rates of change in the general price level), (2) appropriation-specific outlay rates3, and (3) specific price escalation rates for military pay, civilian pay, fuel, and medical.  SAF/FMC uses the inflation rates to produce  the  “raw”  inflation  indices.    Further,  SAF/FMC  uses  the  inflation  rates  and  the appropriation-specific outlay rates to produce the “weighted” inflation indices.  Additionally, SAF/FMC  uses  the  specific  price  escalation  rates  to  produce  the  specific  price  indices  for military  pay,  civilian  pay,  fuel,  and  medical  expenses.    Normally,  OUSD(C)  revises  and publishes inflation and specific price escalation rates annually.  When the rates are published, they  typically  include  a  brief  statement  of  instruction  on  where  they  must  be  used.    For example, the OUSD(C) Inflation Guidance as of December 20104 stated that “these rates are to  be  reflected  in  the  FY2012  President’s  Budget  submission,  as  well  as  supporting congressional justification materials.” 2.1.1.  An organization can request an exemption from using the OUSD(C) inflation rate.  The exemption process is described in paragraph 5 below.  Since the OUSD(C) inflation rate accounts for the change in the value of the dollar, an exemption request should show that the currency the organization uses is devaluing at a different rate than the dollar.  If the organization uses the dollar for all transactions, then an exemption will not likely be granted. 2.1.2.  An organization may not request an exemption from using the OUSD(C) specific price escalation rates for military pay, civilian pay, fuel and medical expenses.  However, the  use  of  different  specific  price  escalation  assumptions  for  these  categories  is encouraged when performing sensitivity analyses.  Additionally, it should be noted that price escalation rates for military pay and civilian pay are for US military personnel and US Government civilians only and not intended to account for contracted labor.                                                  3 Outlay Profiles are disseminated within DoD by OUSD(C) and are used in developing weighted indices.  See Appendix A2.2.2. for more details.   4 https://guidanceweb.ousdc.osd.mil/documents/current/01_Budget%20Guidance%20-%20Current/FY%202012 %20Inflation%20Guidance%20FINAL.pdf AFI65-502  13 MAY 2015   7  Figure 2.1.  Chart 1 - Chain of Policy.  2.2.  SAF/FMC develops Air Force “weighted” inflation indices based on OUSD(C) inflation rates  and  outlay  patterns.    Analysts  must  use  these  indices  when  normalizing  for  inflation (e.g.,  when  converting  then-year  dollars  to  base-year  or  constant  year  dollars)  unless  an exemption  has  been  approved  as  described  in  paragraph  2.1.1.    When  performing  cost estimates, analysts should forecast costs as accurately as possible by including all causes of price  change,  not  just  inflation.    Therefore,  analysts  should  use  a  specific  price  index  (or whatever methodology provides the best forecast) to estimate future costs.  The specific price index includes both real price changes and inflation-based changes.  As a result, the inflation-based price change is implicitly included in a specific price index. 2.3.  OUSD(C) prescribes price escalation rates for a few specific expense categories such as military  pay,  civilian  pay,  fuel  and  medical.    SAF/FMC  uses  these  prescribed  rates  to produce specific price indices.  As specific price indices, they should not be confused with inflation  indices.    These  specific  price  indices  are  to  be  used  in  forecasting.    For  other categories of  expenditures (e.g., aircraft parts,  contract labor, etc.), the  analyst must either choose  or  develop  the  price  index  that  will  most  accurately  forecast  future  requirements.  After building a then-year estimate with an appropriate price index, the analyst may need to calculate  a  corresponding  constant-year  cost  estimate.    When  removing  the  effects  of inflation  (normalizing  to  a  constant-year  dollar),  the  Air  Force  inflation  indices  should  be used. 2.3.1. Historically,  fuel  and  pay  accounts  have  been  converted  to  what  was  called  a “constant-year  dollar”  using  the  same  price  index  that  was  used  to  forecast.    This  is inconsistent with the term “constant-year dollar” because it normalizes for more than just inflation.  Instead, this technique is more consistent with the term “constant price” (see Attachment 1, Terms).  Generally speaking, fuel and pay accounts are treated as if they do not have outlays beyond the year of appropriation.  Therefore, when normalizing for inflation alone (i.e., removing the effects of only inflation for fuel and pay accounts), the raw inflation index should be used.   8  3.  Responsibilities. AFI65-502  13 MAY 2015 3.1.  SAF/FMC is the Air Force office of primary responsibility (OPR) for inflation matters.  SAF/ FMC: 3.1.1.  Prepares inflation and specific price indices based on guidelines provided by OMB via OUSD(C), who then pass them on to SAF/FMC. 3.1.2.  Makes appropriation-specific inflation and specific price indices available for all Secretariat  and  Air  Staff  offices  (e.g.,  Deputy  Assistant  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  for Budget  (SAF/FMB)),  major  commands  (MAJCOM),  Field  Operating  Agencies  (FOA), and Direct Reporting Units (DRU). 3.1.3.  Loads the inflation and specific price indices onto the Air Force Portal.  SAF/FMC recommends  using  the  Air  Force  Inflation  Calculator,  an  Excel©  add-in,  for  inflation conversions.    SAF/FMC  updates  this  program  annually.    The  program  is  located  on SAF/FMC’s site on the Air Force Portal. 4.  Index Use and Documentation. 4.1.  Apply the following when using specific price indices and inflation indices: 4.1.1.  Cite the source and date of the inflation indices and specific price indices used.  If the index was developed by an in-house analyst, explain the methodology. 4.1.2.  Use the current SAF/FMC indices for the most relevant appropriation category for the  program  (or  program  element).    SAF/FMC  provides  inflation  for  the  major appropriation  categories  (listed  in  Attachment  4)  and  specific  price  indices  for  fuel, military pay and civilian pay. 4.1.2.1.  If the program (or element of a program) does not exactly match one of the appropriation categories listed in Attachment 4, select an appropriation category that would  be  expected  to  have  a  similar  outlay  profile  as  the  program  under consideration. 4.1.2.2.  The inflation and specific price indices currently in effect are posted on the Air  Force  Portal.    They  will  remain  in  effect  until  superseded  by  a  subsequent SAF/FMC publication. 4.1.3.  The  use  of  different  inflation  and  specific  price  escalation  assumptions  is encouraged when performing sensitivity analyses. 4.1.4.  When  developing  then-year  cost  estimates,  analysts  should  use  information  and methodologies with the highest probability of accurately estimating the budget authority that will be required.  Subsequent to developing the then-year cost estimates, conversion between  then-year  and  constant-year  dollars  will  be  performed  using  the  current  Air Force inflation indices (unless an exception is approved by OUSD(C)). 4.2.  Specific Price Indices. 4.2.1.  A specific price index measures the total change in price of a good or service (or a basket of goods or services) over a period of time.  As such, it includes both real price changes and changes due to inflation.  As mentioned earlier, the prices of goods rise and fall at different rates.  Consequently, specific price indices tend to be narrowly focused on AFI65-502  13 MAY 2015   9  a specific good or industry.  Specific price indices are used to make then-year to then-year price conversions.  For example, a price index conversion from FY2000 to FY2010 takes the price of an item in FY2000 and converts it to the price one would expect to pay for that same item in FY2010. 4.2.2.  Finding  or  developing  and  then  applying  specific  price  indices  requires  analyst judgment.  There is no index that will be applicable in all situations. 4.2.3.  When selecting a specific price index, the analyst should choose the index that will most  accurately  predict  the  future  cost  behavior  of  the  program  under  consideration.  Some  ideas  that  may  be  useful  when  forecasting  program  costs  using  specific  price indices are mentioned below. 4.2.3.1.  If possible, the analyst may want to develop a specific price index based on information from the program under consideration.  Examples include specific price indices  derived  from  the  program’s  historical  data  (where  the  historic  data  is  an indicator of future cost behavior), or a forward pricing rate agreement (FPRA) from the program. 4.2.3.2.  Specific  price  indices  are  developed  by  companies  who  forecast  economic trends  and  conditions.    Companies  may  forecast  specific  commodity  price  indices (e.g., Global Insight© Titanium Index) or specific price indices that are an industry-level composite (e.g., Global Insight© Aircraft Engine and Engine Parts Index). 4.2.3.3.  US Government agencies, to include organizations within the DoD, produce specific price indices.  For example, the Bureau of Labor Statistics develops Producer Price Indices (PPI) for many goods and services. 4.2.4.  Price data exists in many different forms.  Some examples are: raw prices for each year, rate of change from one year to the next, prices indexed to a base year, and a total price for a project across many years.5  When analyzing the historical data, the analyst needs to carefully consider the form of the data (e.g, constant year dollar, constant price, then year dollar). 4.2.5.  The analyst will need to determine whether or not to weight a specific price index using  outlays.  When  using  historical  obligation  data  to  build  a  price  index,  the  outlay profile is already included in the data.  In this case, the resulting price index is already weighted and no further weighting is necessary.  (Historical data may be used for items such as parts and supplies that are purchased frequently over many years).  Otherwise, the analyst  will  need  to  use  judgment  to  determine  if  the  index  requires  weighting.    For example, Bureau of Labor Statistics Producer Price Indices (and Global Insight forecasts) should be weighted because of the form of the data collected for the index. 4.2.6.  When developing estimates of the annual budget authority required on a specific program, the analyst is encouraged to use the appropriate price escalation coupled with appropriate outlay rates.  Outlay rates can be determined by examining such things as: the unique  contract  terms  (e.g.,  spend  plan),  commodity  specific  outlays  (e.g.,  space  vs.                                                  5 The term base year here should not be confused with “base-year dollar.”  In this context, the base year of an index refers to the year of the index from which the percent change in price is calculated.  “Base-year dollar” refers to dollars that have been normalized for inflation to a particular year of significance (e.g., program start date).  Paragraphs A3.3 through A3.3.1.2 of this instruction provides additional information.   10  AFI65-502  13 MAY 2015 aircraft),  or  outlay  rates  provided  by  OUSD(C).    Subsequent  to  developing  the  time-phased budget estimate, use current Air Force inflation indices to convert between then-year and constant-year dollars, (unless an exception is approved by OUSD(C)). 4.3.  When  using  a  Cost  Estimating  Relationship  (CER)  or  historical  analogy,  the  analyst should  evaluate  the  data  to  determine  whether  constant-year  data  or  then-year  data  will ultimately yield the most accurate price forecast.  Any price adjustment from one then-year to another then-year should carefully consider the most applicable specific price index. 4.3.1.  When  receiving  data,  ensure  the  data  owner  clarifies  how  the  data  has  been normalized.  Data received may be characterized as constant year, but the data may not have  been  normalized  in  a  way  that  is  consistent  with  the  definition  in  this  AFI.  Whenever receiving data, the analyst should also obtain information on how the data was normalized. 5.  Exemption Process. 5.1.  When requesting an exemption from OSD inflation rates for calculating constant-year dollars, apply the following guidance. 5.1.1.  Forward  a  request  for  exemption  to  the  MAJCOM-level  Financial  Management office (FM).  The MAJCOM/FM must concur with the request. Headquarters Air Force organizations will submit directly to SAF/FMC. 5.1.2.  MAJCOM/FMs will forward to SAF/FMC if they concur with the request 5.1.3.  SAF/FMC  coordinates  and  obtains  appropriate  Secretariat  and  Air  Staff coordination. 5.1.4.  SAF/FMC forwards the request to OUSD(C) for approval. 5.2.  The request should include the following items: 5.2.1.  Proposed rates, sources, methodologies and justification for why the rates are more appropriate. 5.2.2.  Comparison  between  OUSD(C)  rates  (or  SAF/FMC  indices)  and  the  proposed rates, with an indication of the impact on the program. 6.

The  notion  of  expressing  program  costs  in  a specified Base-Year is equivalent to expressing those costs in Constant-Year Dollars of the same year. Base-Year Dollar—the dollar's value at the midpoint (April 1) of a Base Year and implies this value  throughout  the  Base  Year.    When  cost  estimates  are  stated  in  Base-Year  Dollars,  it  is implicit  that  the  overall  purchasing  power  of  the  dollar  has  remained  constant  over  the  time period being costed. Constant  Prices—  expressing  the  value  of  an  item  in  the  price  of  a  particular  year  by normalizing for market changes applicable to that price.  Note that constant prices are different from constant-year dollars.  With constant-year dollars, the dollars are adjusted only for inflation.  With constant prices, market price changes over time (including, but not limited to inflation) are normalized.  Constant price adjustments are made using a specific price index whereas constant-year dollar adjustments are made using the inflation index.  Constant prices can be expressed as (CPXX)  where  XX  is  the  year  in  which  the  prices  are  being  expressed.    Also,  for  any  value expressed in constant prices, the analyst must document the index used to normalize the prices (e.g., Global Insight, PPI 3364, updated 11 Dec 2013).  Constant Prices may be used for cost estimating and analysis (e.g., CER development). Constant—Year Dollar6—the value or purchasing power of a dollar in any specific year, which may or may not be the Base Year.  Constant-Year dollars do not contain any adjustments for inflationary changes that occurred or are forecast to occur outside of the Base Year.  Constant-Year Dollars are not influenced by Outlay Profiles (Expenditure Patterns).  Also known as Real Dollars.                                                  6 The Air Force definition for constant-year dollars is consistent with definitions of constant-year dollars in both the economics and finance communities (sources: Farlex Financial Dictionary, Wall Street Words, Investopedia, Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank http://www.minneapolisfed.org/glossary.cfm#i, Macroeconomics textbook by Mankiw).   AFI65-502  13 MAY 2015   13  Cost  Estimating  Relationship  (CER)—“an  equation  used  to  estimate  a  given  cost  element using an established relationship with one or more independent variables. The relationship may be mathematically simple or it may involve a complex equation (often derived from regression analysis of historical systems or subsystems).  CERs should be current, applicable to the system or subsystem in question, and appropriate for the range of data being considered.”7 Equilibrium Price—the price at which the supply of a good equals the demand for that same good. Escalate—generally means to increase.  Costs can escalate for reasons other than inflation (e.g., increase in a building’s maintenance costs due to age). Inflation—a rise in the general price level caused by an increase in the volume of money and credit relative to the available goods.  Inflation is usually measured by a broad-based (general) price index such as the implicit deflator for Gross Domestic Product. Nominal Growth—refers to the year-to-year change in program funding as expressed in then-year dollars.  Nominal growth includes both real growth and inflation. Nominal Price—the price of a good or service expressed in Then-Year Dollars. Normalization—when applied to inflation, it is the elimination of inflationary or deflationary impacts contained within historical cost data.  Inflation normalization means conversion of Then-Year dollar amounts to program Base-Year Dollar amounts or Constant-Year Dollar amounts. Outlay—“the amount of checks issued or other payments made (including advances to others), net  of  refunds  and  reimbursements.    The  terms  ‘expenditure’  and  ‘net  disbursement’  are frequently used interchangeably with the term ‘outlay.’  Gross outlays are disbursements and net outlays are disbursements (net of refunds) minus reimbursements collected.”  8  There is a time lag between budgeting funds (congressional appropriations), contracting for goods and services, the receipt of the goods and services and payment for the goods and services.  This time lag often results  in  payments  of  monies  over  several  fiscal  years,  with  each  year’s  cost  influenced  by inflation specific to that year.  Each major appropriation has a distinct outlay profile (expenditure pattern), based upon historical obligation to outlay experience by fiscal year. Outlay  Profile—reflects  the  rate  at  which  funds  in  each  appropriation  are  expected  to  be expended  based  on  historical  experience.    Outlay  Profiles  are  implicitly  considered  in  the budgetary  concept  of  Then-Year  Dollars.    Outlay  Profiles  are  disseminated  within  DoD  by OUSD(C) and are used in developing Weighted (Composite) Inflation Indices.  Also known as Spendout Rate or Expenditure Profile. Outyears—the years after the first year of a budget or analysis. Raw  Inflation  Indices—are  used  to  convert  from  Base-Year  (Constant-Year)  Dollars  in  one fiscal year to Base-Year (Constant-Year) Dollars in another fiscal year.  Raw Inflation Indices are not influenced by Outlay Profiles. Raw Inflation Rate—reflects the relative change in general price level occurring from the mid-point of one fiscal year (April 1) to the mid-point of the next fiscal year.                                                  7 DAU Principles for Life Cycle Cost Estimates https://acc.dau.mil/CommunityBrowser.aspx?id=314773#3.7.2.1.1  8 DoD FMR 7000.19, Glossary   14  AFI65-502  13 MAY 2015 Real Growth—refers to the year-to-year change in program funding as expressed in Constant-Year Dollars.  Since real growth is expressed in Constant-Year Dollars, it excludes inflation.  It is usually displayed as a percentage and is computed by dividing the Constant-Year Dollars in one year by that of the previous year and subtracting 1.000. Specific Price Escalation—the change in the nominal price of a good or service (i.e., the total change in price) over a period of time.  It includes the effects of inflation and the market, and is measured by a specific price index. Specific  Price  Index—measures changes in the price of a precisely defined good/service or a basket  of  goods/services  over  time.    For  example,  a  price  index  conversion  from  FY2000  to FY2010 will yield the price one could expect to pay in 2010 for a good originally purchased in 2000.  Price indices are used to make then-year to then-year conversions. Then-Year  Dollar—reflects the amount of funding needed (expected to be needed) when the expenditure for goods and services were (are expected to be) made.  All PPBES documents use Then-Year  Dollars  to  properly  reflect  the  Total  Obligation  Authority  (TOA)  that  must  be appropriated during a specific  fiscal  year if sufficient funds  are to be  available to pay  for the goods  and  services  when  received.    For  AF  Comptroller  purposes,  Then-Year  Dollars  are identical to current dollars; they are known as nominal or budget dollars. If Then-Year Dollars are written with a specific year (e.g. TY11$), then those dollars reflect the amount of funding needed if the funds for all goods and services were obligated in the year used (e.g. FY 2011 for TY11$). Total  Obligation  Authority  (TOA)—the  financial  requirement  of  the  Future  Years  Defense Plan (FYDP), or any component thereof, necessary to support the approved program.  The total budget  authority  received  and  posted  in  the  accounting  system  supporting  an  organization’s approved  program.    TOA  includes  the  anticipated  reimbursements  an  organization  expects  to earn plus the organization’s direct budget authority. Weighted  Inflation  Indices—inflation  indices  computed  by  combining  Outlay  Profiles  with Raw Inflation Indices to include the lag effect on inflation of expending funds over a multi-year period.  (Note: Expenses for personnel and fuel are generally either not outlayed in subsequent years, or are not inflated when outlayed beyond the fiscal year of obligation.  Therefore, these expenses do not use weighted inflation indices.)  AFI65-502  13 MAY 2015   15  Attachment 2 USING INFLATION INDICES A2.1.  Selecting the appropriate index. A2.1.1.

To adjust for any and all other potential changes in a then-year dollar to then-year dollar conversion (such as real economic price changes as discussed in section 1 of this AFI), a specific price index (not an inflation index) should be used9. A2.1.2.2.  Caution  should  be  exercised  when  using  a  weighted  index  to  convert  from Base-Year  or  Constant-Year  Dollars  to  Then-Year  Dollars.    As  stated  above,  inflation indices  only  adjust  for  inflation.    As  such,  the  analyst  must  separately  account  for  all other  potential  causes  for  changes  in  price  that  could  occur  over  time  (such  as  real economic price changes as discussed in section 1 of this AFI).

Examples of Dollar Conversions Using the Inflation Indices. A2.2.1.  Dollar Conversions Using Raw Inflation Indices.  Converting constant dollars from one  year  into  constant  dollars  of  another  year  is  a  two-step  process.    The  first  step  is  to convert your dollar value to the base year of the inflation index.  This is done by dividing the dollar value by the index value that corresponds to the year in which the dollar is currently expressed.    The  second  step  is  to  convert  that  newly  acquired  inflation  indexed  base-year dollar  value  into  the  year  in  which  the  dollar  needs  to  be  expressed.    To  do  this,  simply multiply the newly computed base-year dollar value times the index value for the year into which you want to convert. A2.2.1.1.  General  formula  for  converting  dollars  using  raw  inflation  indices    (The variables “i” and “j” represent fiscal years, e.g., FY05 and FY10): A2.2.1.2.

Dollar Conversions Using Weighted Inflation Indices. A2.2.2.1.  In order to convert Constant-Year Dollars of one year into Then-Year Dollars of the same or another year, use a weighted inflation index with a base year that is the same as the  year  FROM which  you  are converting.   Then multiply the  constant-dollar amount by the weighted index for the desired then-year. A2.2.2.2.  As noted in paragraph A2.1.2.2, exercise caution when using a weighted index to convert from a constant-dollar of one year to a then-year dollar of another year.  Since inflation indices only adjust for inflation, the analyst using this approach is only adding   18  AFI65-502  13 MAY 2015 inflation (to include inflation in the outlay profile) to the constant-year dollar.  Any other market  changes  in  price  that  occur  between  the  initial  year  and  the  year  to  which  the analyst is converting are not included in this calculation.  As a result, if the price of the estimated product grows faster than inflation, the estimate will be understated. A2.2.2.3.  There  are  three  scenarios  when  using  an  inflation  index  to  convert  from Constant-Year  Dollars  to  Then-Year  Dollars  is  applicable.    The  first  scenario  is  when inflation (to include the outlay profile) is the only change in price between the initial year and the year to which the analyst is converting.  (In this scenario, the price change over the time period is expected to exactly mirror inflation).  The second scenario is when the Constant-Year  Dollar  was  previously  converted  from  the  same  Then-Year  Dollar  to which the analyst is now converting.  In this case, the same inflation index must be used in the conversion from the Constant-Year Dollars to Then-Year Dollars as was originally used to convert from the same Then-Year Dollars to Constant-Year Dollars.  The third scenario  is  when  converting  from  Constant-Year  Dollars  to  Then-Year  Dollars  of  the same year.  In this case, the conversion is only accounting for the obligation profile.  A2.2.2.4.  In order to convert Then-Year Dollars into Constant-Year Dollars of the same or other year, use a weighted inflation index with a base year that is the same as the year TO  which  you  are  converting.    Then,  divide  the  Then-Year  Dollar  amount  by  the weighted index value for the then-year.  A2.2.2.5.

Explaining  Inflation.  Inflation  can  be  defined  as  an  increase  in  the  general  level  of prices.  For there to be an increase in the general level of prices, there must be an item that is used to measure the value of all other goods and services (i.e., a common item by which prices are measured).  The item used to measure the value of all other goods and services is commonly called money.  Simply stated, inflation occurs when the money supply increases at a faster rate than the number of goods and services available in the economy10.  This can be demonstrated with  the  relationship  known  as  the  equation  of  exchange.    The  equation  of  exchange  is  as follows:  Where: M  represents the money supply,  V  represents the velocity of money (or “the rate at which money circulates through the economy”11), represents the average price level, and represents real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) P  A3.1.1.  For now assume y and V are constant.  Consequently, if M suddenly increases (e.g., the government prints a lot of money), P would have to increase, as well, in order to maintain the relationship.  This insight is referred to as the quantity theory of money and assumes that the increase in the money supply is not accompanied by a similarly large increase in the real GDP (y) or a similarly large decrease in the velocity of money (V).  Particularly in the short-term, an increase in the money supply may have some impact on y and V that would dampen the effect on prices.  That being said, the equation of exchange helps us to understand that money is similar to other goods.  With a significant increase in the supply of money, the value of money relative to other goods will decrease; stated another way, with an increase in the supply of money, the general level of prices will rise. A3.1.2.  Just as the equation of exchange is an economy-wide relationship, inflation should be thought of as an economy-wide (i.e., macroeconomic) phenomena, not a microeconomic (i.e., related to a subset of the economy, like a single company or industry) phenomena.  As such, during inflationary periods, it is quite possible that some prices will fall.  For example, a  decline  in  computer  prices  should  not  necessarily  be  considered  the  result  of  deflation, particularly when other prices rise.  Rather, the decline in computer prices are more likely the                                                  10 A slightly more sophisticated view is that inflation occurs when the relationship between the supply and demand for money are changing in a way that is causing the value of the money to decline when compared with all other goods.  In addition to an increase in the money supply, this could also happen if, over time, the people of a country stop using the local currency in favor of a foreign currency. 11 Mankiw, N. G. (2007). Macroeconomics. New York: Worth Publishers.  The velocity of money can be viewed as the number of times a dollar changes hands (i.e., is spent on a good or service) in a specified period of time.  The quicker people spend the money they earn, the higher the velocity of money.  Conversely, the longer people hold onto the dollars they get, the slower the velocity of money.    22  AFI65-502  13 MAY 2015 result  of  market  changes  in  the  computer  industry  (e.g.,  technological  advancements,  new products making current products less desirable, patent expirations, etc.). A3.1.3.  The existence of inflation does not mean that the prices of all goods and services will rise evenly.  Differences in the supply and demand for different goods in the economy cause  the  prices  of  some  goods  to  rise  faster  than  others.    As  a  result,  price  changes  in  a particular program (such as those seen in forward pricing rate agreements) are unlikely to be solely due to inflation, but rather they are a combination of inflation and other market forces. A3.1.4.  If a program has reliable/accurate information on future price changes, for example escalation clauses in a contract, that information should be used to build the then-year cost estimate.    In  order  to  obtain  the  base-year  cost,  inflation  should  be  backed  out  using  the SAF/FMC inflation indices.  This method should produce both the most accurate then-year cost estimate possible and a base-year cost estimate that includes only “real” price changes resulting from other market forces. A3.2.  Measuring  Inflation.  There  are  several  methods  of  measuring  inflation.    A  simplified example of one method is described below.  (Other methods use a geometric mean which will not be discussed in this AFI). A3.2.1.  Assume  our  economy  contains  only  three  commodities:    Meals,  Ready  to  Eat (MRE); bullets; and combat boots.  Further assume that: (1) these commodities account for 70,  20,  and  10  percent  of  expenditures,  respectively,  (2)  these  proportions  are  stable  over time, and (3) the quality of the three items is constant.  Finally, assume Year 1 in Table A3.1 below is the base year, 2000.  Table A3.1 provides additional information: Table A3.1.  Raw Inflation Example. Year 1-2000 2-2001 3-2002 4-2003 5-2004 Price per MRE $2.00 $2.05 $2.15 $2.25 $2.30 Price per Package of Bullets $5.00 Price per pair of Boots $20.00 Aggregate (i.e., Wtd Average) Price $4.40 Annual Inflation (Yr-to-Yr Change) --- Compound Inflation (Cumulative Change) --- $5.10 $20.35 $4.49 2.05% 2.05% $5.35 $20.50 $4.625* 3.01% 5.11% $5.45 $20.65 $4.73 2.27% 7.50% $5.50 $21.25 $4.835* 2.22% 9.89% Raw (i.e., Compound) Inflation Index --- 1.0205 1.0511 1.0750 1.0989 * For calculation purposes, fractional cents were shown in the table. A3.2.2.  Calculating inflation rates. A3.2.2.1.  The Aggregate Price (i.e., the “General Price Level”).  Raw inflation rates measure  changes  in  the  general  price  level  from  year  to  year.    Theoretically,  the aggregate  price  is  the  weighted  average  price  of  all  goods  and  services  sold  in  the economy.    In  practice,  it  is  generally  the  weighted  average  price  of  a  representative basket of goods purchased by the “average” consumer.  In our rather limited economy of AFI65-502  13 MAY 2015   23  three commodities, it is the weighted average of the prices of our three commodities.  The weights are provided in paragraph A3.2.1.  The aggregate, or weighted average, price is calculated as follows:  So, for Year 1 (the year 2000 in Table A2.1), the calculation is:  A3.2.2.2.  Calculating Annual Raw Inflation Rates.  Inflation is an economy-wide measure of the general change in price level, which in our very limited economy is the percent change in aggregate price from year to year.  The inflation rate for a given year, say year i, is calculated by a 2-step process: (1) subtract the aggregate price in the prior year (i.e., year i-1) from the aggregate price in year i (the year for which inflation is being calculated), then (2) divide the resulting number by the previous year’s (i.e., year i-1) aggregate price.  Example calculations using numbers from the table are:    A3.2.2.3.  Calculating Compound Raw Inflation Rates.  While an annual inflation rate measures the percent change in aggregate price from year to year, a compound inflation rate  measures  the  cumulative  percent  change  in  aggregate  price  for  a  time  period generally longer than one year.  The compound inflation rate is calculated by subtracting the aggregate price at the beginning of the period from the aggregate price at the end of the period.  The resulting number is then divided by the aggregate price at the beginning of the period.  Example calculations using numbers from the table are:    A3.3.  Calculating inflation indices.  The first step in building an inflation index is to establish a base year.  The base year will be the point of reference from which inflation to all other years is measured. A3.3.1.  Base  Year.    Using  inflation  indices  requires  an  understanding  of  the  term  “base year.”  There are two base years to consider: (1) the inflation index’s base year, and (2) the program’s base year. A3.3.1.1.  The base year in an inflation index (or a price index) is the year in which the value  (i.e.,  purchasing  power)  of  the  dollar  is  set.    The  base  year  in  a  raw  index  will   24  AFI65-502  13 MAY 2015 always  have  an  index  value  of  one  (i.e.,  1.0000)  because  1.0000  dollar  will  buy  one dollar’s worth of goods/services in that year.  It is the year by which all index values for other years in the index are measured.  The base year for a weighted index will not have a value  of  1.0000  because  the  outlay  profile  is  considered  when  calculating  the  index.  (Theoretically, it is possible for the weighted index in the base year to be 1.0000, but it can only happen if the raw inflation indices for all years in the outlay profile are 1.0000 [i.e., there has been no inflation in all years in the outlay profile.]) A3.3.1.2.  The base  year for a program is usually defined as the fiscal  year in which a program  was  initially  funded  or  re-baselined.    It  is  a  point  of  reference  representing  a fixed price level for the program. A3.3.2.  Calculating  a  raw  (compound)  inflation  index.  A raw inflation index measures compound inflation, and as such may also be referred to as a compound inflation index.  This index measures inflation from the base year to the year of interest and provides a simple way to  calculate  changes  in  cost  due  to  inflation.    The  raw  inflation  index  is  calculated  by dividing  the  aggregate  price  in  the  year  for  which  inflation  is  being  calculated  by  the aggregate price in the base year.12  Example calculations using numbers from the table are:    A3.3.2.1.  The inflation index provides a simple way to calculate changes in cost due to inflation.  For example, given the base-year price, to estimate the price of a good at some point in the future, say Year 4, simply multiply the price of the good in the base year by the inflation index for the desired year (i.e., year 4). Applying this formula to estimate the price of bullets in Year 4 due to inflation:   However,  when  looking  in  Table  A2.1  above,  the  price  of  bullets  in  Year  4  was  $5.45,  not $5.375.  How can that be?  This means that of the 45 cent increase in price over the three years from Year 1 to Year 4, $0.375 was due to inflation and $0.075 was due to other market related causes (e.g., shortage of supply of bullets, increase in demand, increase in cost of inputs, etc.). A3.3.2.2.  The inflation index also provides a simple way to convert a future-year cost estimate (CE), say in Year 5, to a base-year cost estimate.  To estimate the base-year price of a good given the future-year CE, simply multiply the price of the good in the future year (i.e., Year 5) by the                                                  12 You may notice that you will get the same answer if you calculate the compound inflation rate for the period from the base year to the year of interest and add 1.0. AFI65-502  13 MAY 2015   25  inflation index for the base year, then divide by the inflation index for the future year (i.e., Year 5).  For example:  Applying this formula to estimate the base-year price of boots given a Year 5 cost estimate:  However, when looking in Table A3.1 above, the price of boots in the base year was $20.00, not $19.34.  How can that be?  This means that if inflation were the only thing affecting the price of boots, we would expect the base year price to be $19.34.  That is, inflation alone would have caused the price of boots to rise $1.89 over the four-year period.  But in reality, since the price actually only increased $1.25, ($21.25 - $20.00), or $0.64 less than what would have been caused by inflation alone, there were other market forces at work that prevented the price from rising the full  $1.89.    Some  possible  reasons  are  weakening  demand  for  boots,  productivity  increases, reduction in the number of production regulations, patent expirations, lower producer taxes, etc.  All of these would decrease upward pressure on the price of boots over the four years from Year 1 to Year 5. A3.3.2.3.  This concludes the methodology used to calculate a raw (compound) inflation index. A3.3.3.  Developing a weighted inflation index.  The weighted inflation index differs from the raw inflation index in that it takes into account when the funds leave the Treasury (when the outlay occurs).  For example, an organization is provided a certain amount of funding in its Operations and Maintenance (O&M) account each fiscal year.  These O&M funds must either be obligated by the end of the fiscal year or returned to the Treasury.  While the funds must be obligated in that fiscal year, the funds do not have to be outlayed (i.e., expended, or leave the Treasury) within the fiscal year.  The outlay can, and many times does, occur after the  close  of  the  fiscal  year.    It  is  similar  to  a  credit  card  purchase  where  the  purchase obligating payment is made during the fiscal year, but the check actually paying the bill and settling the debt occurs after the fiscal year ends.  With the nature of government purchases, though, sometimes projects implemented take several years to complete and are committed to without  knowing  the  exact  cost.    As  a  result,  sometimes  funds  are  obligated  in  one  fiscal year, but don’t actually pay (outlay) until several years later. A3.3.3.1.  Due to the fact that outlays often occur in a different year than obligations, the Air Force produces and uses weighted inflation indices.  The theory behind a weighted index is that contractors determine the funding needed for a project knowing that part of the project accomplishment will happen in a subsequent year and as a result, will require more funding due to inflation.  The government, in turn, looks at previous outlay rates to determine historically what percentage of the outlay occurred in the year the funding was appropriated  and  what  percentage  belongs  in  each  subsequent  year.    While  the  O&M appropriation will be used as an example, all appropriations are handled the same way, although they each have their own unique outlay profile.  These outlay profiles are then   26  AFI65-502  13 MAY 2015 used to create the weighted inflation indices.  A set of notional outlay rates can be seen in Table A3.2.  Each number is a percentage.  Notice that each row in the table adds up to 100 percent. Table A3.2.  Notional Outlay Rates. OUSD(C) Outlay Rates (Notional) 1.73 1.50 4.00 2.00  2.79  1.04  4.00 10.00  5.30  5.25  4.55 30.50 23.40 27.50 Year 1  Year 2  Year 3  Year 4  Year 5  Year 6  Year 7 59.81 58.15 14.00  8.80  8.50 82.18 20.00 19.91 28.21 57.05 23.66 32.15 34.53 47.40 50.70 55.00 17.82 40.00 57.21 33.54 34.57 22.23 18.30 22.88 24.34  8.38 21.21 2.60 3.10 1.70           10.60 19.46  7.25          5.30 5.80 3.99 2.67     Budget Account 3400  O&M 3600  RDT&E 3300  MILCON AF 3830  MILCON ANG 3730  MILCON AFR 3010  Aircraft Procurement Special 3010  Aircraft Procurement Other 3020  Missile Procurement Special 3020  Missile Procurement Other 3080  Other Procurement Special 3080  Other Procurement Other 7.97 3.71 1.76 A3.3.3.2.  Using the outlay table and the raw inflation indices above, we can develop a weighted index for the O&M appropriation (as well as all other appropriation categories listed).  Because the weighted index accounts for expenditures occurring in years after the obligation, the weighted index value for FY2000 allows calculation of the actual amount of funding required to pay for obligations occurring in FY2000.  Table A3.3 contains the basic information that is needed to calculate the weighted index for the year 2000. Table A3.3.  Information Needed to Calculate a Weighted Index. YEAR  YEAR  OUTLAY  INDEX 1.0000 1.0205 1.0511 1.0750 59.81% 32.15% 5.25% 2.79% 2000 2001 2002 2003 1 2 3 4 A3.3.3.3.  The first step in developing a weighted inflation index is to divide the outlay percentage by the raw inflation index.  This converts the funding spent in years subsequent to the appropriation year to a base year (“Year 1”) value. A3.3.3.4.  The second step is to add the base year values just calculated.  This provides the true value of $1 that will be obligated in “Year 1” and outlayed according to the outlay profile.  As seen in Table A3.4 below, the dollar obligated in “Year 1” is really only worth 98.90 cents (in “Year 1” BY dollars) because the value of that dollar was eroded by inflation during the time represented by the outlay profile. A3.3.3.5.  Performing this drill provides a ratio used to perform the third and final step in calculating the weighted index value for “Year 1.” Knowing that $1 budgeted for “Year AFI65-502  13 MAY 2015   27  1” only has the spending power of 98.90 cents, we can determine how much we need to budget in “Year 1” to have $1 spending power.  As a result, for the third step use the relationship that $1 is to .9890 as the variable X is to $1.  Putting that in a formula yields:    Algebraic manipulation yields:  A3.3.3.6.  This  means  the  weighted  inflation  index  for  Operations  and  Maintenance (3400) for the year 2000 is 1.0111.  The calculations can be seen in Table A3.4 below. Table A3.4.

Generalized formula for converting between then year and constant year.  With the conversion formulas in paragraphs A2.2.2.3 and A2.2.2.4, the analyst had to use the weighted inflation index with a base year that was the same as the Constant-Year Dollar.  The formulas below are more generic in that they allow the analyst to use any weighted inflation index, but also require the use of a raw inflation index when converting between TY and CY dollars.  The first formula shows the conversion from Then-Year Dollars to Constant-Year Dollars.  With a simple algebraic manipulation, we can also generically show the formula for converting Constant-Year Dollars to Then-Year Dollars.    28  AFI65-502  13 MAY 2015 A3.4.  The difference between Inflation and The Time Value of Money. A3.4.1.  Discount rates and inflation rates are often a source of confusion.  Discount rates (or interest rates that are greater than zero) exist because people prefer to have something today as  opposed  to  waiting  to  have  the  item.    To  get  the  item  earlier,  people  have  to  borrow against  future  income  and  are  willing  to  pay  a  positive  interest  rate  in order  to  obtain  the item. A3.4.2.  Discount rates and the Air Force.  The Air Force corporately prefers consumption today in that it would rather have a capability today than to wait.  The market mechanism that measures the value of money over time is the interest rate.  A positive interest rate indicates that  people  (and  the  Air  Force)  value  consumption  today  more  than  future  consumption.  Looking at this relationship in reverse, having $100 today is more valuable than having $100 one year from now because earning interest on the $100 now will yield more than $100 a year from now.   The discount rate dictated by OMB Circular A94 is the treasury rates of various maturity lengths.  The reason the treasury rates are used is that if the funding is not spent, the Federal deficit will be lower and some interest payments will not be incurred. A3.4.3.  Inflation  however,  is  not  concerned  with  investments.    As  described  in  this instruction, inflation rates are the result of changes in the general price level over time. A3.4.4.  Three terms that explain common ways of expressing funds are as follows: A3.4.4.1.  Then-Year  Dollars  -  These  are  dollars  that  reflect  inflation  from  year  to  year.  These are the type of dollars you would expect to see in a budget. A3.4.4.2.  Constant-Year  Dollars  -  These  are  dollars  that  are  expressed  in  terms  of  a particular  year  (i.e.  base  year).    These  dollars  do  not  reflect  changes  due  to  inflation.  They are also called real dollars. A3.4.4.3.  Constant-Year Dollars Discounted - These dollars are similar to the constant year dollars in that they do not reflect changes in inflation.  In addition, these dollars are discounted  to  better  make  a  comparison  of  dollars  from  different  years,  noting  that  a dollar  today  is  worth  more  than  a  dollar  in  the  future  because  today’s  dollar  can  be invested for a return in excess of the dollar. A3.4.4.4.  For additional information on discount rates and discounting, see AFMAN 65-506. A3.5.  Contrasting Inflation and Specific Price changes A3.5.1.  Types  of  Indices:  Inflation  Index  and  Specific  Price  Index.    An  inflation  index measures the general change in price level for all goods and services (i.e., from the growth in the  money  supply  relative  to  goods  and  services).    A  common  general  price  index measurement is the GDP deflator.  Conversely, a specific price index measures changes in the nominal price of a good or service over a time period.  It accounts for the entire change in the price of a particular good, regardless of the cause (inflation and/or market). A3.5.2.  Specific Price Escalation vs. Inflation:  Specific price escalation is an increase in the price of a particular good or service (or sub-group of goods and services) over time.  Specific price escalation is distinct from inflation in that inflation is intended to measure the average change in price across all goods and services. AFI65-502  13 MAY 2015   29  A3.5.3.  Rates  vs.  Indices:  The  Services  receive  rates  from  OSD  and  turn  those  rates  into indices.  The indices have a benchmark year against which all other years are measured.  As such, the indices measure change from that benchmark year.  The rates received from OSD measure change from one year to the next instead of being benchmarked to a certain year.   30  AFI65-502  13 MAY 2015 Attachment 4 MAJOR AIR FORCE APPROPRIATIONS 3010 – Aircraft Procurement: Provides for fabricating and procuring aircraft weapon systems, modifications,  direct  ground  support  equipment,  aircraft  industrial  facilities,  investment-type spares, war consumables, miscellaneous aircraft requirements, and technical data. 3020 – Missile Procurement: Provides for fabricating and procuring missile weapon systems, operational  space  systems,  modifications,  investment-type  spares,  component  improvements, missile  industrial  facilities,  miscellaneous  missile  requirements,  site  activation,  and  technical data. 3080  –  Other  Procurement:  Provides  for  procurement  of  direct  and  indirect  ground  weapon support material (vehicular equipment; electronic and telecommunications equipment, including cryptologic  equipment;  other  installation  maintenance  and  support  equipment),  installation-procured local purchase equipment industrial preparedness measures, equipment modifications, and  spares  and  repair  parts.
