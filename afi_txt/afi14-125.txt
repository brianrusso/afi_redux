The  objective  of  CMCT  is  to  develop  a  high  state  of  cryptologic  mission  readiness among  1A8  personnel.  CMCT  programs  address  common  cryptologic  intelligence  tasks associated with target-specific mission planning; mission execution; analysis and reporting; and post-mission Processing, Exploitation, Dissemination (PED), as applicable to the 1A8 function.  1A8 personnel who perform functions IAW Attachment 2 must complete CMCT before flying unsupervised  on  operational  sorties,  regardless  of  the  unit  to  which  they  are  assigned.    (T-1)  This includes providing unsupervised downlink support for operational sorties.  Designated lead units of primary  responsibility  will develop and  validate CMCT programs for their  respective 1A8 functions.  (T-1) 3.2.  CMCT Enrollment/Completion Timing. 3.2.1.  1A8  personnel  who  perform  functions  IAW  Attachment  2  will  be  entered  into Airborne CSP not later than (NLT) 30 days from the date on which the member in-processed or was attached to the combat-coded line flying unit or intelligence activity.  (T-2)   1A8 personnel upgraded to management positions must also complete CMCT.  (T-1) 3.2.2.  CMCT program managers must annotate any training gap in member’s training folder by Memorandum for Record detailing the reason for the gap and the date CMCT is projected to resume.  (T-2) 3.2.3.  1A8 personnel, including management positions, will complete CMCT NLT 120 days from date of entry (AFR and ANG personnel who are not in Active Duty status are allowed 240 calendar days).  (T-2) 3.2.4.  1A8 personnel identified to pursue a different CSP skill-set will enter the new CMCT as soon as possible and complete the training within 120 days.  (T-1) 3.2.5.  Upon  CMCT  entry,  1A8  personnel  will  receive  an  initial  training  and  experience assessment to determine training needs.  (T-1)  The assessment determines areas of strengths and weaknesses and provides a baseline measurement for program effectiveness. 3.2.6.  CMCT will be suspended for members attending Professional Military Education or Significant Language Training Events and resumed upon completion of such training.  (T-2) 3.2.7.  The successful completion of CMCT is validated by achieving a passing score on a comprehensive CSPT.  Completion of CMCT is documented IAW wing or group policy and uploaded into the 25 AF CSPM portal on JWICS. 3.3.  CMCT minimum requirements. 3.3.1.  The Wing, Group, or other organizations directly subordinate to 25 AF shall publish minimum  requirements  based  on  the  CTL  for  each  applicable  1A8  function  in  their supplement to this instruction.  (T-2)  Units may supplement CMCT with training materials from other programs. 3.3.2.  Feedback  and  trend  analysis  programs  will  be  implemented  to  improve  the  training processes and ensure CSPT is a fair and accurate measure of cryptologic skills.  Results of   8  AFI14-125  12 JANUARY 2015 the analysis will be provided to the Unit Commander or Director of Operations at least semi-annually.  (T-2) 3.4.  CMCT Exemptions.  1A8 personnel who have a permanent change of assignment/station to an organization performing the same intelligence activity, within the platform or like function, will be exempt from entering CMCT if they are current.  (T-3) AFI14-125  12 JANUARY 2015   9  Chapter 4 CRYPTOLOGIC SKILLS PROFICIENCY TEST 4.1.  Testing  Requirements.  1A8 personnel CSPT should be aligned with their 11-2 Mission Design Series (MDS), Volume 2 flight evaluation.  All 1A8 personnel who perform functions IAW Attachment 2 are required to pass a CSPT to complete CMCT.  (T-1)  1A8 personnel are required to pass a CSPT at least once every 17 months for recertification purposes.  (T-1)  Non-compliant 1A8 personnel, are not allowed to fly unsupervised on operational sorties (in that 1A8 function)  and  will  fly  with  an  instructor  or  certified  trainer  of  the  same  1A8  function  until  a passing  CSPT  is  achieved.    (T-1)    Commanders  will  direct  additional  training  if  necessary  to ensure all 1A8 personnel attain and maintain a state of proficiency to ensure mission success.  (T-1) 4.2.  CSPT.  CSPT  evaluates  common  cryptologic  intelligence  tasks  associated  with  target-specific  mission  planning,  execution,  analysis  and  reporting,  and  post-mission  PED,  as  they apply to the 1A8 function.  CSPT provides a snapshot of each area trained and forms the basis for overall process improvement.  The wing, group, or other organization directly subordinate to 25 AF will establish and publish the minimum CSPT requirements, tailored to fulfill specific unit missions for each applicable 1A8 function, in its own supplement to this instruction using the following guidelines:  (T-1) 4.2.1.  CSPT requirements for 1A8X1X functions using Cryptologic Language Analyst skills (e.g.,  Cryptologic  Operator  (CO),  Analysis  Operator  (ANO),  Direct  Support  Operators (DSO))  must  include  Academic  knowledge  and  aural  skills  tests  tailored  to  meet  the 1A8X1X function and mission-specific requirements.  Note:  1A8X0 personnel are exempt from this provision unless operationally filling a CO or ANO position.  Academic knowledge tests  should  include  vocabulary,  terminology,  target  knowledge,  order  of  battle,  and geography.    The  minimum  passing  score  is  85%.    Aural  testing  methods  may  range  from target-specific  transcription  proficiency  checks  to  aural  recognition  tests.    The  minimum passing score is 85%. 4.2.2.  CSPT  requirements  for  1A8X2  functions  using  Airborne  ISR  Operator  skills  (e.g., Acquisition  Operator  (AO),  Signals  Search  and  Development  (SSD),  Tactical  Support Operator (TSO)) include an academic knowledge test and a proficiency skills test tailored to meet the 1A8X2 function and mission-specific requirements.  The minimum passing score is 85%.  Note:  1A8X0 personnel are exempt from this provision unless operationally filling an AO or SSD position. 4.2.3.  CSPT  requirements  for  1A8  functions  using  Management  Position  skills  (e.g., Airborne  Mission  Supervisor  (AMS),  Airborne  Analyst  (AA),  Data  Link  Operator  (DLO), Mission Crew Supervisor (MCS)) include a current passing baseline (e.g., ACLA, ANO, AO, SSD)  CSPT,  prior  to  entry  into  a  management  position  upgrade.    (T-2)    As  required, management operators need a current passing baseline CSPT to perform ACLA, ANO, AO, SSD specific duties.  Note:  1A8X0 personnel are exempt from baseline requirements unless tasked  to  perform  ACLA-,  ANO-,  AO-,  or  SSD-specific  duties.    Testing  shall  include  a management academic knowledge test and should include common cryptologic intelligence tasks  associated  with  target-specific  mission  planning,  mission  execution,  analysis  and   10  AFI14-125  12 JANUARY 2015 reporting, and post-mission PED, as applicable to support tasking.  The  minimum passing score is 85%. 4.3.  Additional CSPT guidance. 4.3.1.  1A8X1X functions.  When CSP materials for a specific language or target area are not available, the unit commander may request waives for any or all of the CSP requirements for the specified area until materials become available.  Send CSP material waivers to 25 AF for approval.  Commanders will revalidate waivers every 180 days.  (T-2)  To facilitate mission accomplishment,  the  commander  designates  personnel  as  initial  cadre.    Personnel  are considered certified in the area until sufficient materials become available to develop a CSP.  Document  initial  cadre  appointment  on  a  memorandum  for  record  and  place  the memorandum in the individual’s training folder. 4.3.2.  Develop  and  maintain  at  least  three  versions  of  the  CSPT.    At  least  25%  of  the questions contained in each test version must be different. 4.3.3.  Re-test  not  sooner  than  three  duty  days  and  NLT  30  calendar  days  after  the  first failure.  Administer a third CSPT in the event of second failure.  In this situation, the unit commander determines what is considered a sufficient study period.  After any failure, all training and preparation accomplished prior to the failed test needs to be documented in the member’s training folder. 4.3.3.1.  Detail  what  additional  training  was  accomplished,  the  total  number  of  hours spent completing additional training and study, and any extenuating circumstances. 4.3.3.2.  The  unit  commander  will  lead  a  special  board  to  review  any  individual’s inability  to  successfully  complete  the  CSPT  after  three  attempts  to  determine  an appropriate course of action.  (T-2) 4.3.4.  Completion  of  each  CSPT  is  documented  in  the  CSPM  portal  on  JWICS  and individual training folders.  ROBERT P.
