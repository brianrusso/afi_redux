SECTION A - GENERAL INFORMATION  1.  Purpose of the CFETP.  This CFETP provides information necessary for the AFCFM, MFMs, commanders, training managers, supervisors, and trainers to plan, develop, manage, and conduct an effective career field training program.  This plan outlines the training that individuals in AFSC 2A6X2 should receive in order to develop and progress throughout their career.  This CFETP identifies initial skills, upgrade, and qualification training.  Initial skills training is the Air Force specialty-specific training that an individual receives upon entry into the Air Force or upon retraining into this specialty for award of the 3 skill level.  Upgrade training identifies the mandatory courses, task qualification requirements, and correspondence course completion requirements for award of the 3, 5, 7, or 9 skill levels.  Qualification training is actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an Airman in a specific duty position; this training program occurs both during and after the upgrade training process.  It’s designed to provide the performance skills/knowledge required to do the job.  Proficiency training is additional training, either in-resident or exportable advanced training courses, or on-the-job training provided to personnel to increase their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required for upgrade.  The CFETP has several purposes, some of which are to:  1.1.  Serve as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field training program.  It’s also used to help supervisors identify training at the appropriate point in an individual's career.  1.2.  Identify task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in the specialty and recommend education/training throughout each phase of an individual's career.  1.3.  List training courses available in the specialty, identify sources of training, and identify the training delivery method.   3   1.4.  Identify resource constraints that impact full implementation of the desired career field training process.  2.  Use of the CFETP.  The plan will be used by MFMs and supervisors at all levels to ensure that comprehensive and cohesive training programs are available for each individual in this specialty.  2.1.  AETC training personnel will develop or revise formal in-resident, non-resident, FTD, and exportable training based on requirements established by the users and documented in Part II of the CFETP.  They will also work with the AFCFM to develop acquisition strategies for obtaining resources needed to provide the identified training.  2.2.  MFMs will ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial upgrade and proficiency requirements.  OJT, in-resident training, or exportable courses can satisfy these identified requirements.  MAJCOM-developed mandatory training to support this AFS must be identified in this plan and must not duplicate other available training resources.  2.3.  Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan.  The list of courses in Part II is used as a reference to support training.  3.  Coordination and Approval of the CFETP.  The AFCFM is the approval authority.  The AETC Training Manager for AFSC 2A6X2 initiates an annual review of this document by AETC and MFMs to ensure currency and accuracy.  The MAJCOM representatives and AETC training personnel will identify and coordinate on the career field training requirements.  Using Section II-C, they will eliminate duplicate training.

Superintendent (9-level): A 9-lvl can be expected to fill positions such as flight chief, production supervisor, and various staff jobs.  Additional training in the areas of budget, manpower, resources, and personnel management should be pursued.  Additional higher education and completion of courses outside of their AFSC is also recommended.    5  6.  Training Decisions.  The CFETP uses a building block approach (simple to complex) to encompass the entire spectrum of training requirements for the 2A6X2 AGE career field.  The spectrum includes a strategy for when, where, and how to meet these training requirements.  The strategy must be apparent and affordable to reduce duplication and eliminate a disjointed approach to training.  The following training decisions were made by MFMs and SMEs at the 2A6X2 Utilization and Training Workshop held at Sheppard AFB, 18-22 Aug 2014.  6.1.  Initial Skills: The AGE initial skills course length was reduced from 87 to 84 academic days, subject to validation.  There were a number of deletions and additions to the initial skills course including multiple changes in levels of training.  Attendees agreed that training on the 7MC-2A should be moved to the MC-20.  It should be noted that as items/equipment is replaced (e.g., -86 vs. -809E), the STS will be adjusted during the next STRT/UTW. Additions/Increased Training included: Troubleshooting; MC-20 operational fundamentals/service/perform ops check; A/M32C-5 troubleshooting; NGH troubleshooting; A/M27T-2 troubleshooting; and AFTO Form 22, Technical Manual (TM) Change Recommendation and Reply. Deletions included: Position equipment on flight line; operate two-way radios; correct malfunctions (to be included with troubleshooting); MC-2A service/perform ops check; MC-7 operational fundamentals/service/ops check; and MA-3D service/perform ops check.  6.2.  5-Level Upgrade Training: The 5-lvl CDC was reviewed.  Volumes 1 and 4 require rewrites; Volumes 2 and 3 require minor edits.  There were multiple changes to proficiency codes and line items in the STS. Additions included: Service inspection floodlight set FL-1D; NGH service; AFTO Form 22, Technical Manual (TM) Change Recommendation and Reply; AF Form 1067, Modification Proposal; Deficiency Reporting System; MC-20 operational fundamentals; troubleshoot SGNSC; annual powered AGE inspect; -16 test set; and -60 schematic foldouts.

This section of the CFETP identifies known resource constraints that preclude optimum and desired training from being developed or conducted, including information such as cost and manpower.  Narrative explanations of each resource constraint and an impact statement describing what effect each constraint has on training are included.  Also included in this section are actions required, office of primary responsibility, and target completion dates.  As a minimum, resource constraints are reviewed and updated annually.  12.  Apprentice Training.  MFMs agreed that they desired training on the MC-20 compressor.  If these compressors aren’t received prior to course activation, training deficiencies will occur.  13.  Journeyman Training.  No resource constraints identified.  14.  Craftsman Training.  No resource constraints identified   SECTION E - TRANSITIONAL TRAINING GUIDE - There are no transitional training requirements.  This area is reserved.   PART II  SECTION A - COURSE OBJECTIVES  1.  Introduction.  Each proficiency-coded STS task or knowledge item taught in the initial skills course is measured through the use of an objective.  An objective is a written instruction for the student so that they know what’s expected of them to successfully complete training on each task.  Each objective is comprised of a condition, a behavior, and a standard that states what’s expected of the student for each task.  The condition is the setting in which the training takes place (e.g., TOs, type of equipment, etc.).  The behavior is the observable portion of the objective (e.g., “…perform an operational check.”).  The standard is the level of performance that’s measured to ensure that the STS proficiency code level is met (e.g., “…with no more than two instructor assists.”).  2.  Objective Measurement.  Each objective uses letter codes to identify how it’s measured.  The code PC indicates that a progress checklist is used to measure task performance.  The code W indicates that an end-of-block written test is used to measure the subject/task knowledge.  The code PC/W indicates the use of a subject/task knowledge progress check and an end-of-block measurement used to measure the subject/task knowledge.  3.  Objective Standard.  The standard for written examinations is a minimum of 70%.  Standards for task performance objectives are indicated in the objective and are also indicated on the individual progress check (PC) checklist.  The checklist is used by the instructor to document each student’s progress on each task.  Instructor assistance may be provided as allowed during the PC, and students   13  may be required to repeat all or part of the behavior until satisfactory performance is attained.  Students must satisfactorily complete all written/performance PCs prior to taking the written test.  4.  Proficiency Level.  Review column 4A of the STS to determine the proficiency code level for a particular task or knowledge item.  Review the course objective list to determine which STS item the objective supports.  Review the proficiency code key in Attachment 1 of this CFETP for an explanation of the proficiency codes.  All but one task performance is taught to the ‘2b’ proficiency code level; ‘2b’ means that the student can do most parts of the task, but only needs help on the hardest parts of the task (partially proficient).  The student can also determine step-by-step procedures for doing the task.  5.  Course Objective Listing.  A detailed listing of initial skills course objectives is available upon request; contact the OPR.   SECTION B - SUPPORT MATERIAL - There are currently no support material requirements.

This area is reserved.   SECTION E - SPECIALTY TRAINING STANDARD (Attachments 2 and 3)  11.  Implementation.  The STS - General (Atch. 2) will be used for initial skills training provided by AETC for classes beginning 5 June 2015.  12.  Purpose.  As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, the STS - General:  12.1.  Lists in column 1 ((Tasks, Knowledge, and Technical References (TR)) the most common tasks, knowledge, and technical references necessary for Airmen to perform duties in the 3, 5, and 7 skill levels.  12.2.  Identifies in column 2 (Core Tasks) by asterisk (*) specialty-wide training requirements.  As a minimum, certification on all AFCFM-directed core tasks applicable to the specialty must be completed for skill level upgrade.  Exemptions:  12.2.1.  Core tasks which aren’t applicable to base-assigned aircraft or equipment aren’t required for upgrade (units aren’t required to send personnel TDY for core task training).   16   12.2.2.  For units with more than one mission-design aircraft (e.g., C-130), upgrade trainees need only complete core tasks on a single mission-design.  MFMs, unit commanders, and/or supervisors may require trainees to complete core task training on additional mission-design aircraft if desired.  If some of these core tasks involve training in another unit on base, trainees must still complete all core tasks relevant to at least one mission-design aircraft.  Flight line-assigned personnel must complete back-shop core tasks and vice versa.  All units are bound by the requirements in this CFETP and will accommodate core task trainees from other units.  12.2.3.  Units that use the G081 maintenance data collection system don’t need to complete Integrated Maintenance Data System (IMDS) Computer-Based Training (CBT) core tasks; units that use IMDS don’t need to complete G081 CBT core tasks.  12.3.  Provides certification for OJT.  Column 3 is used to record completion of tasks and knowledge training requirements.  Use IMDS/G081 to document technician qualifications if available.  Task certification must show a certification or completion date.  12.4.  Shows formal training and correspondence course requirements.  Column 4 shows the proficiency to be demonstrated on the job by the graduate as result of training on the task/knowledge and the career knowledge provided by the correspondence course.  12.5.  Qualitative Requirements.  Attachment 1 contains the proficiency code key used to indicate the level of training and knowledge provided by in-resident training and CDCs.  12.6.  Job Qualification Standard.  This STS becomes a job qualification standard (JQS) for OJT when placed in AF Form 623, On-The-Job Training Record, and used IAW AFI 36-2201.  For OJT, the tasks in column 1 are trained and qualified to the go/no-go level.  ‘Go’ means the individual can perform the task without assistance and meets local requirements for accuracy, timeliness, and correct procedures.  When used as a JQS, the following requirements apply:  12.6.1 Documentation.  Document and certify completion of training IAW AFI 36-2201.  Automated records, utilizing IMDS/G081, reflecting this STS are highly encouraged.  Use of Part II and Attachments 1, 2, and 3 of this CFETP are mandatory in individual training records.  12.6.1.1.  Transcribing from Old CFETP to New CFETP.  All AFJQSs and previous CFETPs are replaced by this CFETP; therefore, transcribing of all training records to this CFETP STS is mandatory.  Use this CFETP STS (or automated STS) to identify and certify all past and current qualifications.  Document and certify all previous and current training IAW AFI 36-2201.  12.7.  STS.  These STSs are used as guides for the development of promotion tests used in the WAPS.  Specialty Knowledge Tests (SKTs) are developed at the AETC A3/AAD (Airman Advancement Division) by senior NCOs with extensive practical experience in the career field.  The tests sample knowledge of STS subject matter areas judged by test development team members to be most appropriate for promotion to higher grades.  Questions are based on study references listed in the Enlisted Promotions References and Requirements Catalog (EPRRC).  Individual responsibilities are in AFI 36-2502, Airman Promotion/Demotion Programs.  WAPS isn’t applicable to the ANG or AFRC.  13.  Recommendations.
