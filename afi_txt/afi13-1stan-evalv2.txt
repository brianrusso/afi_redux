(T-3). 1.4.2.  Individuals  on  temporary  duty  (TDY)  status  to  a  unit,  with  similar  equipment,  can perform unsupervised operations duties if the crewmember: 1.4.2.1.  Provides  a  current  DD  Form  2992,  Medical  Recommendation  for  Flying  or Special Operational Duty (Canadian equivalent) to the Unit/Chief of Training (COT) to verify current medical status. 1.4.2.2.  Provides  a  current  AF  Form  8,  Certificate  of  Aircrew  Qualification  (Canadian equivalent) to the unit/Chief, Stan Eval (CCV) to verify current qualification(s). 1.4.2.3.  Satisfactorily  completes  COT  prescribed  training  to  include  the  unit’s  local orientation program as directed by the DO. (T-3). 1.4.2.4.  Meets the unit’s Go/No-Go system and Stan/Eval requirements. 1.4.2.5.  When  reporting  to  a  DRU,  provides  joint  service  documentation  regarding previous  control  experience  as  equivalent  to  an  AF  Form  8  and  maintain  these  forms within the member’s Flight Evaluation Folder (FEF). 1.4.2.5.1.  DRUs  will  identify  in  the  unit  supplement  the  steps  required  to  verify foreign nationals are qualified. (T-3).   8  AFI13-1STAN-EVAL2  21 JULY 2015 1.5.  Supplements.  MAJCOMs,  National  Guard  Bureau  (NGB),  Numbered  Air  Force  (NAF), Groups,  DRU,  or  units  may  supplement  this  instruction.    MAJCOM/A3s  (PACAF/A8  for PACAF  units)  will  approve  MAJCOM  supplements.    Supplements  will  not  contain  procedures that are contrary or less stringent to this instruction. 1.5.1.  Units,  with  NAF  oversight,  will  forward  their  supplements  through  appropriate channels to the NAF and respective MAJCOMs for review, coordination, and approval (T-3).  ANG  units  will  coordinate  their  supplement  with  NGB/A3Y  as  well  as  the  NAF  with Stan/Eval  oversight  responsibility.  (T-2).  The NAF with  Stan/Eval  oversight  responsibility will be the approval authority for unit supplements and will provide the applicable MAJCOM a copy of the approved supplement. (T-2). 1.5.1.1.  DRUs  and  units  without  NAF  oversight  will  coordinate  their  supplements through their Group prior to forwarding to their parent MAJCOM OPR for approval. (T-2). 1.5.2.  Additional forms required by MAJCOM supplements will be approved and issued as AF Forms if they apply to more than one command and comply with AFI 33-360. 1.5.3.  MAJCOM and unit supplements will be formatted in accordance with (IAW) AFI 33-360. (T-2). 1.6.  Waiver Authority. 1.6.1.  Waiver authority  for requirements of this volume will be  IAW AFI-33-360.  Waiver requests  must  come  from  commanders  (or  civilian  directors)  of  the  affected  unit  seeking relief  from  compliance  through  the  command  chain  up  to  the  appropriate  tier  approval authority (i.e., Tier 0, 1, 2, 3) (or publications approval authority if non-tiered).  See AFI 33-360 for definition of Tier Ratings. 1.6.1.1.  Waiver  requests  are  sent  via  email  using  AF  Form  679,  Air  Force  Publication Compliance Item Waiver Request/Approval and must include the following. (T-2): 1.6.1.1.1.  Reference and text of the specific requirement for which the commander is requesting a waiver. (T-2). 1.6.1.1.2.  Provide  rationale  for  the  waiver:    Explain  which  of  the  following  three rationales IAW AFI 33-360 apply and describe why. (T-2). 1.6.1.1.2.1.  The cost of compliance creates unacceptable risk to a higher priority task. 1.6.1.1.2.2.  The expected cost of compliance outweighs the benefit. 1.6.1.1.2.3.  Personnel  cannot  comply  with  the  requirement  due  to  a  lack  of resources (training, funds, equipment, facilities, guidance, or manpower). 1.6.1.1.3.  Time period or circumstance for which the waiver will be required. (T-2). 1.6.1.1.4.  Risk mitigation measures the requesting commander will implement during the waiver period. (T-2). 1.6.1.1.5.  Impact to unit/individual/mission if waiver is disapproved. (T-2). AFI13-1STAN-EVAL2  21 JULY 2015   9  1.6.1.1.6.  Approved  waivers  will  be  uploaded  into  the  unit’s  Management  Internal Control  Toolset  (MICT)  for  inspection  activity  review  and  publication  OPR’s situational awareness/filing. (T-2). 1.6.2.  USAFE-AFAFRICA/A3C,  PACAF/A8X,  and  NGB/A3Y  will  forward  a  copy  of  all approved  waivers  to  ACC/A3C.    ACC/A3C  will,  in  turn,  forward  a  copy  of  all  approved waivers for their units to USAFE-AFAFRICA/A3C, PACAF/A8X, NGB/A3Y, and NAF/A3.  Units  will  report  all  deviations  or  exceptions  without  waiver,  through  channels,  to  the MAJCOM OPR (T-2). 1.6.3.  Units  subordinate  to  a  NAF  will  forward  waiver  requests  through  their  chain  of command, (provide appropriate NAF/A3 with information copy) to MAJCOM OPR (T-2). 1.6.4.  Approval/denial  of  waiver  requests  will  be  completed  IAW  AFI  33-360,  paragraph 1.9.4.3 (T-2). 1.6.5.  Duration of waivers will be IAW AFI 33-360 and may be approved for a period not to exceed  the  requested  waiver  period  or  30  calendar  days  after  the  approving  commander’s tour  length,  whichever  is  shorter.    Because  waivers  are  the  expression  of  a  specific commander  accepting  risk,  Tier  1,  2,  and  3  waivers  automatically  expire  30  days  after  a change of command unless the new commander renews the waiver.   10  AFI13-1STAN-EVAL2  21 JULY 2015 Chapter 2 HIGHER HEADQUARTERS STAN/EVAL FUNCTIONS AND ORGANIZATION ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.

Typical  NAF  Stan/Eval  staff  includes  a  section  chief  and  one  examiner  per MDS.  Manning for NAF examiner positions may be adjusted by the NAF Commander. 2.4.3.2.  USAF  Air  Warfare  Center  (USAFAWC).  The  57  OG/CC  ensures  that  a qualified Instructor Weapons Director (IWD) is appointed to administer the 57 WG WD Stan/Eval  program.    The  wing  examiner  is  assigned  to  57  OG/OGV  and  gives qualification evaluations to WDs assigned to the USAFWS and the 422 TES.  With the recommendation of the OG commander, unit commanders appoint additional duty SEEs to administer evaluations.  The 99 RS operates a separate Stan/Eval program for 1C5XXs assigned to the 99 RW.  57 OG/OGV and 99 RS/RSOV are DRUs to ACC/A3C for WD Stan/Eval issues. 2.4.3.3.  53  WG.  The  53  WG  supports  the  Ground  C2  Systems  Stan/Eval  Program  for the USAFWC and is a DRU to HQ ACC for Stan/Eval. 2.4.3.4.  266 RANS and UTTR are considered DRUs with NAF oversight. (T-3). 2.5.  HHQ  Visits.  HHQ  staffs  may  visit  units  during  the  administration  of  UEIs  or  SAVs  (as requested  by  the  Commander).    HHQ  visits  will  be  coordinated  and  scheduled  with  the MAJCOM Gatekeeper IAW AFI 90-201. 2.5.1.  Crew  Qualification  Evaluations  (CQE).  Crewmember  positional  and  written evaluations and the associated documentation (FEF, AF Form 8, Letter of X or Qualification) are  Stan/Eval  functions.    These  evaluations  are  not  integrated  into  the  IG  function  or  UEI cycle, but the information gained may be included in the UEI final report.  For convenience and continuity, the timing of the CQE will be aligned with the unit’s UEI cycle. 2.5.1.1.  The  CQE  is  the  certification  of  a  unit’s  ability  to  evaluate  the  qualification  of combat mission ready (CMR) crewmembers IAW AFI 13-1 BCC Vol. 2, Battle Control Center (BCC) Evaluation Criteria, AFI 13-1 CRC Vol. 2, Control and Reporting Center (CRC)  Evaluation  Criteria,  and  the  unit’s  Designed  Operational  Capability  (DOC) statement.  A CQE is a  series of formal  evaluations performed by  Higher Headquarters   14  AFI13-1STAN-EVAL2  21 JULY 2015 Examiners  (or  deputized  examiners)  limited  to  crewmember  positional  evaluations  and review  of  qualification/certification  documentation  (i.e.  AF  Form  8,  Letter  of  X  or Qualification).  It will not extend to the inspection of unit programs inspected under AFI 90-201.  If MAJCOM/IG requests, Stan/Eval programs may be inspected coincident with a CQE. 2.5.1.2.  Evaluations  will  be  scheduled  and  tracked  by  the  NAF/OV/A3V  assigned  with oversight  of  the  unit  and  MAJCOM/IG  gatekeeper.    The  desired  window  for  CQE evaluations is six months prior to the UEI Capstone event; however units are eligible to receive CQE evaluations during the entire UEI period and must be coordinated with the applicable Group/CC.  HHQ will notify units 30 days prior to the CQE.  When resources and  scheduling  permit,  evaluations  will  include  objectivity  evaluations  for  all  Group examiners as well as a sampling of other experience levels.  Evaluations administered by HHQ examiners within 6 months of a CQE may be counted toward the evaluation sample for that CQE.  If this option is exercised, all intermediate evaluations by HHQ examiners (including evaluation team designated augmentees) must count toward that sample.  The unit CC must be coordinated with prior to the 6-month period. 2.5.1.3.  (ANG)  CQE schedules for ANG units under ACC oversight will be coordinated with NGB/A3Y and ANG/IG. 2.5.1.4.  Up  to  15%  of  all  CMR/BMC  crewmembers  receive  a  positional  evaluation  or objectivity evaluation per UEI cycle.  Exception:  For ANG units, due to the 4-year UEI cycle, up to 25% of all BMC/CMR crewmembers receive a positional evaluation per UEI cycle.    The  distribution  of  evaluations  should  be  50%  positional  evaluations  and  50% objectivity (Officer in Charge (OIC) and Noncommissioned Officer in Charge (NCOIC) at a minimum).    Evaluations will contain a mix of INST/QUAL/MSN evaluations, with a sample of unit mission types and mission crew experience levels.  NAF/OV/A3V with oversight  of  the  unit  determines  the  final  number  of  evaluations,  distribution  of evaluations, and mix of evaluation types. 2.5.1.5.  An incomplete evaluation accomplished by a HHQ examiner will be considered a  SPOT  evaluation;  a  HHQ  examiner  is  not  required  to  complete  an  all-encompassing qualification  evaluation.    The  evaluation  may  be  completed  for  realignment  of  periodic evaluations by any like-qualified examiner. 2.5.1.6.  All HHQ evaluation examiners shall include the following statement as the first line following the Mission Description in the comments block on the AF Form 8: “This evaluation  was  administered  during  a  MAJCOM  (or  NAF)  CQE.”    Document  all supervisory attendance during mission debriefings.  Furthermore, if in  your opinion, the examinee’s  performance  demonstrated  exceptional  skill  and  knowledge  in  all  phases  of the evaluation, state the words "EXCEPTIONALLY QUALIFIED" on the first line of the Comments section preceding “Examiner’s Remarks”. 2.5.1.7.  CQEs are designed to: 2.5.1.7.1.  Certify the unit’s ability to provide qualified CMR crewmembers. 2.5.1.7.2.  Verify crewmember compliance with approved operational procedures. AFI13-1STAN-EVAL2  21 JULY 2015   15  2.5.1.7.3.  Evaluate and review all aspects of the individual examinee’s qualification.  This includes applicable FEFs, testing, and performance. 2.5.1.7.3.1.  Review 100% of unit’s FEFs. 2.5.1.7.3.2.  All  CMR/BMC  crewmembers  will  be  administered  a  50-question closed book written examination from the MDS-specific MQF and local MQF (if applicable). 2.5.1.7.4.  Provide  feedback  to  commanders  from  a  broad  viewpoint  as  well  as  the specific evaluation of the existing evaluation criteria. 2.5.1.8.  CQE Grading. 2.5.1.8.1.      Units  will  receive  an  overall  grade  of  Complies  (C)  or  Does  not  Comply (DNC).    The  MAJCOM/A3  or  NAF/CC  is  the  final  approval  authority  for  the  unit’s overall grade.  Individual grades for performance and/or program(s) are based on a three-tier system and will receive grades of Complies (C), Complies with Comments (CWC) or Does not Comply (DNC).  The evaluation team, when grading performance, will use the following grading criteria: 2.5.1.8.2.  Complies  (C).  Performance  met  or  exceeded  mission  requirements  and complied  with  applicable  directives.    Deviations  were  minor  and  did  not  affect mission  accomplishment  or  safety.    Performance  was  high  quality  and  indicative  of leadership involvement. 2.5.1.8.3.  Complies  with  Comments  (CWC).  Performance/program  met  mission requirements.  Findings existed that did not affect mission accomplishment or safety. 2.5.1.8.4.  Does  not  Comply  (DNC).  Performance/program  did  not  meet  mission requirements  and/or  comply  with  applicable  directives.    Findings  exist  that  affect mission  accomplishment  or  safety.    Effectiveness  degraded  by  deviations  from  or omission  of  applicable  procedures.    Processes  not  well-defined,  effective  or efficiently  executed.    Performance/program  was  poor  quality  and  indicated  lack  of leadership  involvement.    Units  graded  as  overall  DNC  could  be  directed  by MAJCOM/A3  or  NAF/CC,  (ANG/A3  for  ANG  units)  to  cease  operations  until corrective actions are accomplished. 2.5.1.8.5.  DNC/CWC Corrective Action.  The Chief of Stan/Eval administering the CQE  directs  corrective  actions  for  an  overall  DNC.    The  unit  commander  takes immediate corrective actions on any safety related discrepancies.  Within 10 working days of receipt of the approved evaluation report, the unit commander submits a plan addressing corrective actions on all CWC or DNC programs to the approval authority.  The unit commander submits regular progress reports, as defined in the CQE report, to  the  approval  authority  and  the  approval  authority  makes  the  final  determination when programs have been corrected to a C level. 2.5.1.8.6.  At the end of the CQE, the results are reported to the unit commander IAW Table  2.1  and  a  copy  is  sent  to  ACC/A3CG  (for  ACC  and  ACC  ANG  units) (USAFE-AFAFRICA/A3CO  for  USAFE  units,  PACAF/A8XI  for  PACAF  and PACAF  ANG  units,  and  NGB/A3YG  for  ANG  units).    Overall  results  are  used  to support UEI Capstone inspection development IAW paragraph 2.5.3   16  AFI13-1STAN-EVAL2  21 JULY 2015 2.5.1.8.7.  At  the  end  of  the  CQE,  completed  AF  Form  8s  are  provided  to  the commander. Table 2.1.  CQE Report. The CQE report cover will include the following information: 1.

Team members:  Name/Rank (team chief will be identified) 2.  Key Personnel (as appropriate):      WG/OG/ACG/CCs      SQ/CCs      ACGV/OGV      Team Chief Signature 2.5.2.  Evaluations  will  include  crewmembers  of  various  experience  levels  and  crew positions.    Previous  evaluation  performance  will  not  be  the  only  criteria  for  evaluations.  Crewmembers  maintaining  multiple  qualifications  may  be  evaluated  in  any  of  the qualifications they currently hold.  All available unit examiners will be eligible to receive an Objectivity Evaluation from any designated HHQ/NAF examiner. 2.5.2.1.  Examiners  will  notify  the  Commander  and  Team  Chief  when  an  examinee’s performance  is  less  than  Q-1.    As  a  minimum,  the  examiner  will  provide  a  detailed debriefing  to  the  Team  Chief  at  the  earliest  opportunity.    For  evaluations,  regardless  of AFI13-1STAN-EVAL2  21 JULY 2015   17  mission  profile,  “SPOT”  will  be  entered  in  the  flight  phase  block  of  the  AF  Form  8, unless conducted in conjunction with a pre-coordinated recurring evaluation. 2.5.2.2.  In  addition  to  evaluations,  the  Team  Chief  will  determine  the  sample  size  of available  CMR/BMC  crewmembers to  be  administered  a  closed  book  written examination from the specific MDS MQF unless excused by the team chief.  Academic testing  rating  is  based  on  testing  of  individual  crewmembers  IAW  guidelines  listed  in Table 2.2  Do not assign ratings for each crew position.  Note: Crewmembers (on active orders or on drill status) are required to test unless otherwise unavailable and excused by the unit commander (CC) or the Team Chief.  Crewmembers on leave, TDY, crew/flight scheduled  day  off,  or  restricted  to  quarters/hospital  during  the  CQE  are  not  considered available for duty. Table 2.2.  Stan Eval Written Examination Rating Criteria. Rating Complies (C) Does not Comply (DNC) % Passing 95 and above Below 95 and/or and or Average Score 85.0 — 100 Below 85.0 2.5.2.2.1.  The  written  examination  administered  during  a  CQE  may  fulfill  the requisite closed-book examination requirement if it meets all the appropriate criteria. 2.5.2.2.2.  The  minimum  passing  grade  for  the  written  examination  is  85%.    Table 2.2 outlines the Written Examination criteria. 2.5.2.2.3.  Tests  will  be  administered  via  hard  copy  tests  or  a  MAJCOM-approved electronic  program  (e.g.  Patriot  Excalibur,  Learning  Management  System  (PEX, LMS)). 2.5.2.2.4.  Test multi-qualified individuals in their primary duty position as identified in the unit Letter of X or Qualification. 2.5.2.2.5.  Do  not  assign  positional  duties  to  CMR/BMC  individuals  who  fail  the academic written examination during the CQE until they have had time to study and complete  the  re-examination.    A  minimum  of  24  hours  must  elapse  before administering a re-examination to allow an adequate period to study.  (T-3).  Failure of the re-examination results in: 2.5.2.2.5.1.  The individual downgraded to unqualified (UQ) status and placed in requalification training. 2.5.2.2.5.2.  The examiner completing the AF Form 8 documents the failure IAW chapter 7. 2.5.2.2.5.3.  The individual completing a requalification (RQ) evaluation to regain CMR/BMC status. 2.5.2.2.5.4.  Although the academic test is an academic SPOT evaluation, the AF Form 8 will only be used to document failures.  The AF Form 8 is only required for those individuals who fail the academic test twice during the CQE and will be documented as an unqualified SPOT evaluation.   18  AFI13-1STAN-EVAL2  21 JULY 2015 2.5.3.  Inspections.  HHQ  Stan/Eval  is  responsible  for  supporting  the  units  with  guidance, training, and supporting MAJCOM/IG as a functional expert.  Evaluators designated by the chief of MAJCOM or NAF Stan/Eval will inspect Stan/Eval programs during the UEI.  The MAJCOM/IG  will  coordinate  with  HHQ  Stan/Eval  for  manpower  to  inspect  Stan/Eval programs.  This coordination may be delegated by MAJCOM Stan/Eval. 2.5.3.1.  HHQ Stan/Eval will support MAJCOM/IG as Stan/Eval functional experts IAW AFI 90-201.  At the beginning of each UEI cycle, the HHQ Stan/Eval assigned oversight of  the  unit  will  assign  a  point  of  contact  (POC)  to  coordinate  with  the  MAJCOM/IG.  This POC is responsible for working with the IG team lead on identifying an inspection strategy  tailored  to  the  unit,  planning  and  scheduling  visits,  providing  updates, highlighting known or suspected deficiencies and any other aspect of support given to the UEI process.  The health and effectiveness of the unit is the shared responsibility of the IG  and  the  Stan/Eval  Functional  Area  Managers  (FAM)  deputized  to  assist  in  the  UEI process. 2.5.3.2.  The MAJCOM/IG is ultimately responsible for the inspection of each unit.  It is the Stan/Eval FAM’s responsibility to help shape and define the inspection strategy.  The continuum  of  options  available  for  oversight  is  defined  in  AFI  90-201.    Based  on  the particular  circumstance  of  the  unit,  these  tools  and  strategies  will  be  used  to  tailor  an appropriate level of oversight.  The intent is to provide sufficient contact with the unit to ensure compliance without burdening the unit with unnecessary interference.  An initial plan should be agreed to between the unit and the MAJCOM/IG within 6 months of the start of the UEI Capstone event, but should be updated as required to meet the needs of the IG and the HHQ Stan/Eval. 2.5.3.3.  HHQ Stan/Eval FAMs will monitor and update MICT IAW AFI 90-201. 2.5.3.4.  HHQ  Stan/Eval  FAMs  will  input  reports  and  updates  in  IG  Evaluation Management System (IGEMS) IAW AFI 90-201. 2.5.3.5.  HHQ  Stan/Eval  FAMs  will,  when  able,  provide  support  for  small  team  visits, throughout the UEI cycle. 2.5.3.6.  HHQ Stan/Eval FAMs will, when able, provide support for no-notice inspections conducted by the  IG.   If major deficiencies or faulty  reporting is  suspected, a no-notice inspection  will  be  coordinated  with  the  IG.    These  visits  are  limited  in  scope  and duration,  designed  to  highlight  and  record  significant  discrepancies  and  ensure  the  unit initiates corrective actions. 2.5.3.7.  HHQ  Stan/Eval  FAMs  will  provide  support  for  the  UEI  Capstone  Visit.    The augmentation manning and inspection strategy for the Capstone will be finalized no less than 60 days prior to the visit. 2.5.4.  Support to Units.  HHQ Stan/Eval will support their assigned units with any or all of the following tools as appropriate for the unit and as resources permit. 2.5.4.1.  Provide  guidance  and  training  on  implementation  of  programs  as  well  as  self-monitoring through MICT via formal and informal communications. 2.5.4.2.  Augment  the  Wing  Inspection  Team  (WIT)  in  support  of  the  Commander’s Inspection Program (CCIP) IAW AFI 90-201.  The goal should be for the unit to conduct AFI13-1STAN-EVAL2  21 JULY 2015   19  a  thorough  self-inspection  with  over  the  shoulder  instruction/guidance  from  HHQ evaluators.    The  desired  outcome  is  a  plan  for  correcting  identified  deficiencies  with milestones  for  completion.    No  formal  report  outside  of  the  wings’  documentation  is required. 2.5.4.3.  A SAV provides another avenue for HHQ to provide training and assistance to the  unit.    A  SAV  can  only  be  requested  by  the  Unit  CC  and  coordinated  with  the  IG Gatekeeper.    The  unit  defines  the  scope  and  focus  of  a  SAV.    HHQ  will  out-brief  the appropriate  unit  leadership  and  may  also  provide  a  formal  report  to  both  the  unit leadership and HHQ leadership. 2.6.  Stan/Eval Staff Assistance Visits (SAV). 2.6.1.  MAJCOMs  and  NAFs  may  conduct  SAVs  as  requested  by  the  unit  commander  and coordinated  through  the  MAJCOM  Gatekeeper.    Purpose  will  be  to  ensure  program compliance, provide feedback and crossfeed to the units, exchange information, and provide orientation.  These visits will culminate in a visit/trip report to the visited unit’s CC and DO, as  a  minimum,  and  will  detail  program  deficiencies,  observations,  and  recommendations.  Positional evaluations and academic examinations are not administered. 2.7.  Group. 2.7.1.  Group Commander Responsibilities (T-3). 2.7.1.1.  Direct and support the conduct of the unit level Stan/Eval program. 2.7.1.1.1.  Establish a Group supplement to this instruction, if applicable. 2.7.1.2.  Augment unit Stan/Eval function when requested. 2.7.1.3.  Designate Group Stan/Eval examiners (paragraph 4.2.3). 2.7.1.4.  Direct mission-planning materials are accurate and current. 2.7.1.5.  Direct evaluations to maintain a quality crew force. 2.7.1.6.  Direct supplementary evaluations. 2.7.1.7.  Chair the SEB. 2.7.2.  Group Stan/Eval Functions (T-3). 2.7.2.1.  Monitor the effectiveness of unit Stan/Eval programs. 2.7.2.2.  Monitor and assess the operational readiness of units. 2.7.2.3.  Emphasize  unit  standardization.    Ensure  standardization  among  squadrons  and squadron-assigned examiners. 2.7.2.4.  Establish procedures for review and quality control of AF Form 8s. 2.7.2.5.

General.  The Stan/Eval program utilizes two types of evaluations to ensure qualification of crewmembers  and  standardization  of  operations,  Qualification  Evaluations  and  Supplemental Evaluations.  Qualification evaluations are administered periodically and documented on the AF Form  8 to  ensure individual  qualification.  Supplementary evaluations are unstructured tools to be used by the commander to ensure standardization of battle management C2 (BMC2) and other operations.    (Note:  Unstructured  means  the  evaluations  are  not  periodic,  do  not  have  an expiration date, and do not  cover standard areas.)  For guidance on supplementary evaluations, see Chapter 8. 5.1.1.  When  possible,  QUAL/MSN  evaluations  may  be  administered  rather  than  separate evaluations. 5.1.2.  Multiple  Qualifications.  Multiple  qualification  guidance  applies  to  crewmembers who  maintain  qualification  in  two  or  more  mission  crew  positions  in  an  MDS.    Multi-qualified individuals will complete MSN evaluations, if applicable IAW AFI 13-1 MDS Vol. 2  for  their  secondary  or  tertiary  qualifications  (Except:  for  units  where  MSN  evaluations consist of only a MSN exam) (T-3). 5.1.2.1.  Qualification  (QUAL)  and  Mission  (MSN)  Evaluations.  All  crewmembers require a QUAL evaluation and, if applicable, a MSN evaluation, to include requisites, in each crew position (T-3). 5.1.2.2.  Failure  to  Pass  an  Evaluation.  A  downgrade  resulting  from  a  “Q-3”  in  a QUAL or MSN evaluation applies only to that specific crew position in a particular MDS for  which  the  evaluation  was  administered,  unless,  in  the  opinion  of  the  evaluator,  the discrepancy is applicable to additional crew positions. 5.2.  Categories.  There  are  four  types  of  qualification  evaluations,  Qualification  (QUAL), Mission  (MSN),  Instructor  (INSTR),  and  SPOT,  each  consisting  of  two  structured  phases, ground and flight (Exception: SPOT evaluations may consist of either a ground or flight phase).  Each phase may require the completion of requisite tasks (Exception: a SPOT evaluation has no requisite tasks). 5.2.1.  Use of the Live/Virtual/Constructive (L/V/C) environment for the positional phase of evaluations  is  approved,  as  long  as  positional  phases/events  evaluated  are  of  sufficient fidelity to accurately mimic the weapon system and events to be evaluated.  The Group/CC or  unit  commander  responsible  for  the  simulator  is  the  final  authority  on  the  use  of  the simulator for positional evaluations. 5.2.1.1.  Examinees  on  Duty  Not  Involving  Control  (DNIC)  status  may  receive  an evaluation  in  the  virtual  or  constructive  environment  if  approved  by  the  unit  CC,  not restricted by an DD Form 2992, and agreed upon by the examinee. 5.2.2.  Qualification  (QUAL)  Evaluations.  Ensure  basic  qualification  in  an  MDS  and/or crew position.  Qualification evaluations consist of two structured phases, ground and flight.  The  ground  phase,  when  required,  is  a  requisite  for  a  positional  evaluation  usually  in  the   28  AFI13-1STAN-EVAL2  21 JULY 2015 form of a written examination.  The positional phase is conducted during an L/V/C mission scenario to evaluate crewmember performance. 5.2.2.1.  All crewmembers are to complete a periodic QUAL evaluation in their assigned crew position(s), to include requisites, as specified in the applicable AFI 13-1 MDS Vol. 2.  QUAL evaluations may be combined with MSN evaluations. 5.2.3.  Mission  (MSN)  Evaluations.  Ensure  qualification  to  employ  the  crew’s  assigned weapon  system/crew  position  in  the  accomplishment  of  the  unit’s  operational  or  DOC statements mission(s). 5.2.3.1.  All  crewmembers  maintaining  CMR/BMC  status  will  complete  a  MSN evaluation IAW AFI 13-1 MDS Vol. 2 except as noted for multi-qualified individuals in paragraph 5.1.2 (T-3). 5.2.3.1.1.  The  requirement  for  a  MSN  evaluation  may  be  waived  or  combined  for those  crew  positions  where  performance  of  normal  operational,  test  and  training events  involve  tasks  covered  during  the  accomplishment  of  a  QUAL  evaluation  as specified in AFI 13-1 MDS Vol. 2.  Document waiver or combined evaluation on the AF Form 8. 5.2.3.1.2.  The MSN evaluation shall reflect the type and difficulty of tasks required in the performance of the MDS operational or DOC-tasked missions. 5.2.3.1.3.  Units  will  determine  the  profile  of  these  evaluations  and  adhere  to  the appropriate  overall  grading  criteria  in  this  volume.  (T-3).    Tactical  employment subareas will be evaluated and graded according to parameters in AFI 13-1 MDS Vol. 2. (T-3). 5.2.4.  Instructor  Evaluations.  To  qualify  crew  members  as  instructors  in  their  weapon system/crew position by focusing primarily on the examinee’s instructional ability. 5.2.4.1.  Crewmembers  obtaining/regaining in  a  weapon system/crew  position  must  complete  an  evaluation  of  instructional  capability  in  that weapon system/crew position. (T-3). instructor  qualification 5.2.4.2.  Due  to  the  unique  mission  of  the  266  RANS  and  UTTR,  their  instructors maintain instructor certifications. 5.2.4.3.  Crewmembers  selected  to  become  instructors  must  successfully  complete  an initial  instructor  evaluation.  (T-3).    Subsequent  periodic  evaluations  of  instructors  are conducted during the QUAL evaluations in which individuals instruct and are included in the individual duty positions. 5.2.4.3.1.  All  unit  certified  instructors  current  as  of  the  publication  date  of  this instruction  will  be  considered  “Grandfathered”  qualified  instructors  and  will  be documented via a MFR filed in the FEF and in the Letter of X or Qualification IAW unit  supplements.  (T-3).    Unit  certified  instructors  will  be  provided  an  evaluation during their next recurring evaluation. (T-3). 5.2.4.3.2.  Crewmembers only require a single INIT Instructor (INSTR) within a FEF for a given MDS (preferably in their primary crew position).  An INIT INSTR is not required  for  each  crew  position  that  a  member  is  qualified  to  perform  duties  in.  AFI13-1STAN-EVAL2  21 JULY 2015   29  Multi-qualified instructors will receive instructor evaluations as part of their recurring evaluations  of   Multi-Qualified Instructors  will  also  be  designated  on  the  unit  Letter  of  X  or  Qualification  for  each crew position authorized to instruct. (T-3). the  secondary/tertiary  crew  position.  (T-3). 5.2.4.3.3.  Accomplish  INIT  INSTR  evaluations  on  actual  instructional  missions whenever  possible.    When  students  are  not  available  or  mission/crew  composition requirements prevent inclusion of students, another crewmember or the examiner will serve as the student. (T-3). 5.2.4.3.3.1.  The  emphasis  on  an  initial  instructor  evaluation  must  be  IAW evaluation  criteria  established  in  AFI  13-1  MDS  Vol.  2.  (T-3).    This  does  not preclude  the  update  of  a  required  periodic  evaluation  if  all  required  positional phase  requirements  are  completed  during  the  instructor  evaluation  and  the examinee  subsequently  completes  all  ground  phase  requirements  for  the evaluation within the periods described in paragraph 5.7 and the unit commander concurs.    Label  the  evaluation  appropriately  (Example:  "INIT  INSTR  and QUAL/MSN").    Do  not  add  on  missions  to  complete  the  requirements  for  a periodic  evaluation  unless the crewmember’s  desire  to  realign  the  evaluation  expiration  date  and  approves  the additional requirements. the  group/unit  commander  concurs  with 5.2.4.3.4.  Evaluations of instructor qualification will be conducted during subsequent QUAL evaluations. (T-3). 5.2.4.3.5.  Instructors  who  expire  on  their  QUAL  evaluations  are  not  qualified  to instruct. 5.2.5.  SPOT  Evaluations.  Evaluate  a  specific  event  or  requirement  without  intending  to satisfy the requirements of a periodic evaluation and/or an initial INSTR evaluation. 5.2.5.1.  SPOT  evaluations  have  no  specific  requisites  or  requirements,  unless  specified in  MAJCOM  supplements  but  may  be  No  Notice  IAW  paragraph  5.2.6.4.    HHQ appointed examiners can administer SPOT evaluations at any time in any MDS. 5.2.5.1.1.  A  SPOT  evaluation  can  become  a  QUAL/MSN  evaluation  provided  all requirements  for  the  evaluation  are  completed  within  the  periods  described  in paragraph 5.10 (document on the AF Form 8 IAW paragraph 7.4). 5.2.5.1.2.  Do  not  add  on  missions  to  complete  the  requirements  for  a  periodic evaluation unless the group/unit commander concurs with the crewmember’s desire to realign  the  evaluation  expiration  date  and  approves  the  additional  requirements.  Evaluations  not  listed  in  paragraphs  5.2.2  -  5.2.4  will  be  documented  as  SPOT evaluations. 5.2.5.1.3.  When  the  examiner  administering  a  SPOT  evaluation  is  not  qualified  to evaluate the same crew position in the MDS of the examinee, the evaluation will not be credited towards a periodic evaluation (T-3). 5.2.5.2.  Examiner Objectivity Evaluations. 5.2.5.2.1.  An  objectivity  evaluation  determines  whether  an  examiner  is  capable  of administering  a  qualification  evaluation  IAW  Attachment  6.    Upgrading  examiners   30  AFI13-1STAN-EVAL2  21 JULY 2015 are  required  to  receive  an  objectivity  evaluation  prior  to  being  appointed  as  a squadron  examiner.    Examiners  whose  primary  duty  position  changes  will  not  be required  to  accomplish  another  objectivity  evaluation.  (T-3).    Unit  supplement  will specify  any  additional  requirements.  (T-3).    Use  SPOT  as  the  type  of  evaluation under the Flight Phase, then explain in the mission description that the evaluation was an examiner Objectivity Evaluation.  The overall rating for an objectivity evaluation is based on the evaluation criteria defined in Attachment 6.  Observations, analysis, and  other  substantial  actions  are  directed  primarily  at  the  examiner  conducting  the evaluation  and  will  not  interfere  with  or  affect  the  individual  on  position  except  for flight safety issues. 5.2.5.2.1.1.  An  examiner  objectivity  evaluation  does  not  fulfill  the  requirements of a qualification evaluation. 5.2.5.2.2.  A  qualified  rating  (Q-1)  indicates  the  examinee  complied  with  higher headquarters  and  local  Stan/Eval  directives,  properly  briefed  and  debriefed  the examinee,  correctly  identified  discrepancies,  awarded  the  correct  grade  for  each evaluated  area,  awarded  the  appropriate  overall  grade,  properly  documented  the evaluation and if required, assigned appropriate additional training. 5.2.5.2.3.  An unqualified rating (Q-3) is awarded when the examinee fails to satisfy the requirements of a Q-1.  The certification of the examinee receiving an unqualified examiner  Objectivity  Evaluation  will  be  determined  by  the  Group/CC,  unit/CC  as applicable.  The Group/CC and  unit/CC may, at their discretion issue a commander-directed AF Form 8 for the examinee based upon the examiner’s recommendation. 5.2.5.2.4.  MAJCOM/NAF  examiners  maintaining  a  CMR  or  BMC  qualification  in any MDS may perform an objectivity evaluation on any examiner. 5.2.5.2.4.1.  Unit Chief of Stan/Eval (or designated crew position examiner) may perform objectivity evaluations in any crew position. 5.2.5.2.5.  Document  the  examiner  objectivity  evaluation  on  the  AF  Form  8  IAW Chapter 7. 5.2.5.2.6.  AF Form 8 will be reviewed, approved, and filed in the examinee's FEF. 5.2.6.  Prefixes. 5.2.6.1.  The  following  prefixes  will  be  used,  when  applicable,  to  further  describe  the evaluations listed in paragraphs 5.2.2 - 5.2.4 5.2.6.2.  Initial (INIT).  The first evaluation of any type for a crew position or instructor qualification  in  an  MDS,  (e.g.,  INIT  QUAL,  INIT  MSN,  INIT  INSTR,  INIT QUAL/MSN (BCC)). 5.2.6.2.1.  A  successful  “INIT  QUAL”  must  be  completed  within  30  days  (2  UTAs (For BCC units the UTA periods only apply to DSG/Reservists.)  (T-3).  Individuals have  30  days  of  additional  training  after  an  INIT  QUAL  Q3,  once  released  from training (again) then 30 days to complete the eval. (T-3). 5.2.6.2.1.1.  Document waivers with an MFR to be included in the AF Form 8 and posted in MICT. AFI13-1STAN-EVAL2  21 JULY 2015   31  5.2.6.2.1.2.  There  is  no  prefix  of  a  qualification  evaluation  following  a  failed INIT evaluation, since no qualification was achieved. 5.2.6.3.  Requalification  (RQ).  An  evaluation  administered  to  remedy  a  loss  of qualification due to: 5.2.6.3.1.  Expiration  of  a  required  periodic  evaluation.    The  requalification  will  be IAW the guidance for that periodic evaluation. 5.2.6.3.2.  Individuals who have been unqualified in their MDS. 5.2.6.3.3.  Loss of currency that requires a requalification evaluation (IAW AFI 13-1 MDS  Vol.  1).    In  this  case,  RQ  QUAL/MSN  will  be  used  for  documentation (paragraph 7.4). 5.2.6.3.4.  Failed periodic evaluation.  The requalification will be IAW the provisions of paragraph 5.8.1. 5.2.6.3.5.  Commander-directed  downgrade.    The  requalification  profile  will  be  as directed by the commander on the AF Form 8 (paragraph 7.4). 5.2.6.3.6.  The RQ prefix is not used when expiration of a periodic evaluation is due to  failure  to  complete  one  or  more  of  the  ground  phase  requisites  (paragraph  5.5), but the flight evaluation has successfully been completed within the eligibility period for  an  in-the-eligibility  period  evaluation  or  within  the  period  listed  in  paragraph 5.7.2  for  an  out-of-the-eligibility  period  evaluation,  and  the  Group/CC,  or  154 OSS/CC  determines  that  qualification  will  be  re-established  by  completion  of  the academic requisites without re-accomplishment of the positional evaluation. 5.2.6.4.  No-Notice (N/N). 5.2.6.4.1.  The  no-notice  evaluation  program  provides  commanders  a  sampling  of daily operations performance and an assessment of unit training effectiveness. 5.2.6.4.2.  A  no-notice  evaluation  is  one  where  the  examinee  is  notified  of  the evaluation  at  or  after  the  beginning  of  normal  preparation  for  the  mission.    The beginning  of  normal  preparation  for  a  mission  will  be  determined  by  the  examiner and defined in supplements to this instruction.  The intent is to preclude extraordinary preparation for the mission. 5.2.6.4.3.  An  examinee  may  utilize  a  no-notice  evaluation  to  update  a  QUAL/MSN evaluation expiration date provided all requirements for the evaluation are completed within the periods described in paragraph 5.7 and the unit commander  concurs.  If all  requirements  were  not  completed  on  the  first  simulation  or  live  fly  event, subsequent simulation or live fly events are authorized to complete all required areas. 5.2.6.4.3.1.  If  the  examinee  chooses  to  utilize  a  N/N  SPOT  to  update  his/her QUAL/MSN, document the evaluation as a N/N QUAL/MSN. 5.2.6.4.3.2.  If  the  examinee  elects  not  to  update  a  QUAL/MSN  evaluation expiration date, the evaluation will be documented as a N/N SPOT evaluation. 5.2.6.5.  Simulated  (SIM).  An  evaluation  where  the  positional  phase  is  conducted during a virtual/constructive mission scenario.   32  AFI13-1STAN-EVAL2  21 JULY 2015 5.2.6.6.  Multiple Prefixes.  More than one prefix may be used to describe an evaluation (e.g.,  N/N  SIM  SPOT).    The  applicability  of  any  prefixes  to  portions  of  any  combined evaluations and the purpose for any prefixes will be explained under Mission Description in the Examiner’s Remarks (see paragraph 7.4.5.2.1.2). 5.2.7.  Combined  Qualification  Evaluations.    To  promote  efficient  use  of  operational resources,  accomplish  evaluations  concurrently,  whenever  practical.    If  combined,  include the  designation  of  each  evaluation  in  the  Flight  Phase  section  of  the  AF  Form  8  (e.g., QUAL/MSN). 5.2.8.  Cross-Command Evaluations.  To provide flexibility to units experiencing difficulty in  performing  evaluations  due  to  deployments,  evaluator  availability,  or  other  unique concerns, evaluations may be conducted across MAJCOMs.  The requesting unit must justify the need and explain the reasons to go outside their parent MAJCOM.  ACC and ANG units are not required to submit a cross-command evaluation request between like units as they are considered part of ACC.  Processing of cross-command evaluation requests are accomplished as follows: 5.2.8.1.  Units  identifying  a  need  for  a  cross-command  evaluation  must  coordinate through their chain of command to their MAJCOM OPR. (T-2). 5.2.8.2.  Requests  must  come  from  commanders  of  the  affected  unit  through  the command chain up to the requesting unit’s  MAJCOM OPR. (T-3). 5.2.8.3.  The  requesting  unit’s  MAJCOM  OPR  coordinates  approval  of  the  evaluation with  the  requested  MAJCOM  OPR  and  forward  the  approval  through  channels  to  the requesting unit. 5.2.8.4.  Cross-command evaluation requests may be sent via email or memorandum and include the following: 5.2.8.4.1.  Reference and text of the specific requirement for which the commander is requesting an evaluation. 5.2.8.4.2.  Rationale. 5.2.8.4.2.1.  Explain why the evaluation cannot be accomplished within the unit’s command. 5.2.8.4.2.2.  Unit  cannot  comply  with  the  requirement due to  a lack of resources (e.g. trainers, evaluators, equipment, or evaluation scenarios). 5.2.8.4.3.  Recommended  unit  to  conduct  the  evaluation  and  any  pre-coordination between units. 5.2.8.4.4.  Impact if request is disapproved. 5.2.8.4.5.  Approved  requests  will  be  filed  within  the  individual’s  FEF  and incorporated on the AF Form 8 generated by the supporting MAJCOM. (T-3) 5.3.  Grading System. 5.3.1.  A  two-step  grading  system  is  used  to  evaluate  and  document  crewmember performance. AFI13-1STAN-EVAL2  21 JULY 2015   33  5.3.1.1.  Step one, individual grades are assigned to  each evaluation  requisite to  include the grading of areas/subareas of crew performance against established evaluation criteria (see  paragraph  5.4).    Performance  resulting  in  a  less  than  fully  qualified  must  be documented. 5.3.1.2.  Step two, an overall qualification level is assigned based on a compilation of all individual requisite grades (paragraph 5.3.3.4). 5.3.2.  Performance Areas/Subareas. 5.3.2.1.  Areas/subareas  will  have  a  two-level  (Q/U)  or  three-level  (Q/Q-/U)  grading system  IAW  AFI  13-1  MDS  Vol.  2.    Discrepancies  will  be  documented  against  the established areas/subareas. 5.3.2.1.1.  “Q” indicates the examinee demonstrated both a satisfactory knowledge of all required information and performed crew duties within the prescribed tolerances. 5.3.2.1.2.  “Q-”  indicates  the  examinee  is  qualified  to  perform  the  assigned area/subarea tasks, but requires debriefing or additional training as determined by the examiner.    Deviations  must  not  exceed  the  prescribed  “Q-”  tolerances  or  jeopardize safety as outlined in the particular category. 5.3.2.1.3.  “U” indicates that performance was outside allowable parameters; thereby compromising  safety  with  deviations  from  prescribed  procedures/tolerances  that adversely  affected  mission  accomplishment,  and/or  evaluated  performance constituted  a  breach  of  discipline.    An  examinee  receiving  an  area/subarea  grade  of “U” requires debriefing and/or additional training, as determined by the examiner. 5.3.2.2.  Remedial  Action.  All  grades  of  “Q-”  or  less  requires  remedial  action  that includes either debriefing discrepancies and/or assignment of additional training. 5.3.2.2.1.  Debriefed  Discrepancy.  Remedial action accomplished during debrief of the  evaluation  wherein  the  examiner  provides  briefing/instruction  concerning  the discrepancy and determines that the examinee has gained the necessary knowledge or proficiency to remedy the discrepancy.  The discrepancy area description is annotated with “Debriefed” in paragraph B “Discrepancies” of the Examiner’s Remarks section of the AF Form 8 Comments. 5.3.2.2.2.  Additional Training (AT).  Any training recommended by an examiner to remedy  deficiencies  identified  during  an  evaluation  that  debrief  cannot  adequately cover. 5.3.2.2.2.1.  Units  will  outline  procedures  for  ensuring  additional  training  is accomplished in the unit supplement. (T-2). 5.3.2.2.2.2.  AT may include self-study, academic instruction, and use of a L/V/C event or other MAJCOM-approved training device. 5.3.2.2.2.3.  To  complete  additional  training,  the  examinee  must  demonstrate attainment of satisfactory knowledge or proficiency. (T-3). 5.3.2.2.2.4.  Additional training identified during an evaluation must be completed within 30 days (2 UTAs) from the date of the discrepancy. (T-3).   34  AFI13-1STAN-EVAL2  21 JULY 2015 5.3.2.2.2.4.1.  If  a  crewmember  exceeds  the  allotted  time  for  completion  of AT,  the  unit  commander  will  review  the  situation  and  direct  appropriate action.  Document the circumstances with an MFR to  be included in  the  AF Form 8 (paragraph 7.7.3.2.2). (T-3). 5.3.2.2.2.5.  Once AT is complete, it is documented in Section 2 of the AF Form 8.    AT  requirements  are  outlined  in  paragraph  C,  Recommended  Additional Training, under Examiner’s Remarks in the AF Form 8 Comments section. 5.3.2.2.2.6.  The instructor who completed the AT will notify the COT or NCOIC (if COT is not  available).  (T-3).  The COT or  NCOIC  (if COT is  not  available) will  sign  as  the  Certifying  Official  under  Additional  Training,  Section  II, verifying  completion  of  all  assigned  training  as  documented  in  paragraph  C, Recommended Additional Training, under Examiner’s Remarks. (T-2). 5.3.2.3.  The  examiner  must  grade  the  areas/subareas  listed  as  “required”  in  the  general and specific evaluation sections of the applicable AFI 13-1 MDS Vol. 2. (T-2). 5.3.2.3.1.  Any  additional  areas/subareas  observed  during  an  evaluation  will  be graded IAW AFI 13-1 MDS, Vol. 2. (T-2). 5.3.2.4.  Minor  momentary  deviations  from  grading  criteria  tolerances  are  acceptable, provided  the  examinee  applies  prompt  corrective  action  and  such  deviations  do  not jeopardize  safety  or  mission  accomplishment.    Consider  cumulative  deviations  when determining the overall area/subarea grade. 5.3.2.5.  The examiner may further identify an area/sub-area as “Commendable” if, in the examiner’s  determination,  the  crewmember  has  demonstrated  exceptional  skill  and knowledge  in  that  particular  area/sub-area.    Document  commendable  areas  in  the examiner’s remarks section of the AF Form 8. 5.3.3.  Qualification Levels.  Qualification levels are assigned to both individual evaluations as  well  as  overall  performance.    Individual  evaluations  are  graded  as  a  compilation  of  all area/sub-area  grades.    Overall  performance  is  graded  as  a  compilation  of  all  requisite  tasks associated with the required evaluation.  Both individual and overall grades are based on the following: (Q-1).  The  crewmember  demonstrated  desired 5.3.3.1.  Qualification  Level  1 performance  and  knowledge  of  procedures,  equipment,  and  directives  within  tolerances specified in the grading criteria.  This will be awarded when no discrepancies were noted and may be awarded when discrepancies are noted if: 5.3.3.1.1.  The  discrepancies  resulted  in  no  “U”  grades  being  given  in  any areas/subareas. 5.3.3.1.2.  In  the  judgment  of  the  examiner,  none  of  the  discrepancies  precludes awarding of an overall “Q-1.” 5.3.3.1.3.  All  discrepancies  noted  during  the  evaluation  were  cleared  during  the debriefing of that evaluation. 5.3.3.2.  Qualification  Level  2  (Q-2).  The  crewmember  demonstrated  the  ability  to perform duties safely, but: AFI13-1STAN-EVAL2  21 JULY 2015   35  5.3.3.2.1.  In  the  judgment  of  the  examiner,  there  is  justification  based  on  sub-performance  in  one  or  several  areas/subareas  and  requires  specific  debriefing  or additional training. 5.3.3.2.2.  A non-critical area/subarea grade of “U” was awarded. 5.3.3.3.  Qualification  Level  3  (Q-3).  The  crewmember  demonstrated  an  unacceptable level of safety performance or knowledge. 5.3.3.3.1.  An  area  grade  of  “U”    awarded  in  a  critical  area  requires  an  overall  “Q-3”for the evaluation. 5.3.3.3.2.  An overall “Q-3” can be awarded if, in the judgment of the examiner, there is justification based on performance in one or several areas/subareas. 5.3.3.4.  Assigning the overall qualification level. 5.3.3.4.1.  The  last  examiner  completing  the  evaluation  is  responsible  for  assigning the overall qualification level. 5.3.3.4.2.  An overall grade of “Q-1” or “Q-2” will be given only after all evaluation requirements (to include requisite examinations) have been completed and given due consideration. 5.3.3.4.3.  An overall grade of “Q-3” may be awarded at any time and the evaluation stopped for safety of flight or poor operational performance in a critical area.  Also, the  examiner  may  choose  to  end  or  continue  the  evaluation  after  determining  that  a “Q-3” grade is warranted after assessing poor operational performance in non-critical areas. 5.3.3.4.4.  While AFI 13-1 MDS Vol. 2 may dictate the highest grade for a positional evaluation based on area and subarea performance, examiner judgment will always be the determining factor in deciding the overall grade. 5.3.3.5.  Exceptionally  Qualified  (EQ)  Designation.  The  examiner  may  award  an exceptionally  qualified  designation.    The  designation  can  only  be  applied  to  the  total evaluation  not  to  separate  requisites.    The  designation  may  be  awarded  when  the crewmember has: 5.3.3.5.1.  Demonstrated  exceptional  skill  and  knowledge  in  all  phases  of  the evaluation; 5.3.3.5.2.  Not failed any requisite; 5.3.3.5.3.  Received  a  qualified  grade  with  no  remedial  action  on  all  areas/subareas evaluated during positional evaluations; 5.3.3.5.4.  Achieved a score of 96% or greater on all written examinations. 5.4.  Evaluation  Criteria.  ACC/A3C,  in  coordination  with  applicable  user  MAJCOMs,  will establish  and  maintain  standardized  MSN,  QUAL,  and  INSTR  evaluation  criteria  in  the appropriate  AFI  13-1  MDS  Vol.  2.    ACC/A3C  is  also  responsible  for  coordinating  the establishment  of  areas/subareas  including  the  identification  of  critical  areas  and  those  areas required for evaluation completion.   36  AFI13-1STAN-EVAL2  21 JULY 2015 5.5.  Ground Phase Requisites.  The ground phase requisites for each evaluation include: 5.5.1.  INIT qualification academic testing will be completed prior to any positional portions of  the  evaluation.  (T-3).    For  RQ  evaluations  and  periodic  evaluations,  the  written examination is completed at the discretion of the Chief, Stan Eval. 5.5.2.  QUAL Examination.  General Knowledge.  The written test for a QUAL evaluation. 5.5.3.  MSN Examination.  (Optional).  The crew position written test for a MSN evaluation as defined in the unit’s MSN evaluation profile. (Note: N/A for DRUs) 5.5.4.  QUAL/MSN  Examination.  General  Knowledge.    Crew  position  written  test  for  a combined  QUAL/MSN  evaluation.    Separate  QUAL  and  MSN  examinations  are  not required. 5.6.  Flight  Phase.  The live/virtual/constructive environment event execution in the MDS or, if applicable, a suitable simulator profile that will allow evaluation of individual performance. (T-3). for  evaluations flight  phase include 5.6.1.  The profile used to fulfill the flight phase evaluation must incorporate all appropriate requirements set  in  the applicable AFI 13-1 MDS Vol. 2 and allow an accurate measure of the proficiency of the examinee. (T-3). 5.6.2.  Evaluation  profiles  will  reflect  unit  tasking,  daily  training  missions,  be  realistic,  and incorporate current tactics applicable to the unit mission. (T-3).  Each evaluation profile will be  reviewed  annually  with  the  reviewed  date  recorded  on  the  front  page  of  the  evaluation profile. (T-3).  Stan/Eval, Training, and Tactics personnel should review evaluation profiles. 5.7.  Requisite  Completion.  One  set  of  requisites  may  be  used  to  satisfy  the  requirements  of combined  evaluations  as  defined  in  AFI  13-1  MDS  Vol.  2.    For  all  evaluations,  accomplish requisites as follows: 5.7.1.  In-the-Eligibility  Period.  For  scheduled  or  no-notice  periodic  evaluations  in  the eligibility period, all requisites must be completed within the six-month eligibility period of the current evaluation. (T-3).  The Group/CC may waive this requirement on a case-by-case basis (document on the AF Form 8 IAW paragraph 7.7.3.2.2). 5.7.2.  Out-of-the-Eligibility Period.  For periodic evaluations outside the eligibility period, all requisites must be completed within a six-month period encompassing the month in which the  positional  evaluation  was  administered.  (T-3).    (Exception:    For  extended  evaluations, requisites may be completed between the beginning of the six-month eligibility period prior to the original expiration date and the extended expiration date.) 5.7.3.  Requisites  from  a  completed  evaluation  may  be  used  for  subsequent  evaluations provided they cover all required areas and are within the requisite zone for each evaluation. 5.8.  Failure to Pass a Positional Evaluation. 5.8.1.  Requalification.  If  a  crewmember  fails  a  positional  evaluation,  a  successful positional  requalification  must  be  completed  (to  include  requalification  training  conducted IAW AFI 13-1 MDS Vol. 1) by the end of the third month after the date of the first failure, e.g. for an evaluation on 1 Jan 16, complete the requalification by 30 Apr 16. (T-3). AFI13-1STAN-EVAL2  21 JULY 2015   37  5.8.1.1.  Time  limit  waivers  are  accomplished  on  a  case-by-case  basis  and  processed IAW paragraph 1.6. (T-3). 5.8.1.2.  Document  the  waiver(s)  with  an  MFR  to  be  included  on  the  AF  Form  8  IAW paragraph 7.7.3.2.2 and posted in MICT. 5.8.1.3.  The  examiner  that  administered  the  original  evaluation  will  not  normally administer the RQ evaluation. (T-3). 5.8.1.4.  Requisites  that were  valid  for  a  failed  evaluation  per  paragraph  5.7.1  or  5.7.2 remain valid IAW paragraphs above. 5.8.2.  Status  Downgrade.  Downgrade  crewmembers  receiving  a  “Q-3”  QUAL  or  MSN evaluation to “UQ”.  For instructor evaluations, crew status (i.e., CMR or BMC) need not be downgraded if the discrepancies were only in instructor areas. 5.8.3.  Restrictions.  When  called  for  by  this  instruction  or  deemed  necessary  in  the judgment  of  the  examiner,  restrictions  will  be  imposed  on  the  examinee  until  successful completion of assigned additional training and a RQ evaluation. (T-3). 5.8.3.1.  Restrictions shall address the specific phase (i.e. live control) and/or operations that require supervision and the criteria for removal of the restrictions (T-3). 5.8.3.1.1.  Substandard  performance  in  any  area/subarea  may  require  restrictions  to ensure operational safety or mission accomplishment. 5.8.3.2.  Specific  restrictions  and  the  criteria  for  the  removal  of  the  restrictions  are documented  as  the  first  item  on  the  AF  Form  8  Comments  section.    Restrictions associated with failed written examinations are not documented on the AF Form 8. 5.8.3.3.  Crew  members  receiving  a  “Q-3”  on  all  evaluations,  except  INITs,  may  re-establish  the  specific  qualification  by  accomplishing  a  requalification  evaluation  (to include requisites) and will complete the following. (T-3): 5.8.3.3.1.  QUAL  Evaluation.  Place  the  examinee  on  supervised  status  in  the  crew position  in  which  the  evaluation  was  administered,  unless  the  discrepancy  is applicable  to  additional  crew  positions  for  multiple  qualified  crewmembers  (where the crewmember will also be on supervised status). 5.8.3.3.2.  MSN  Evaluation  (N/A  for  DRUs).  The  examinee  may  perform  basic qualification  tasks  unless  specifically  restricted.    Place  the  examinee  on  supervised status for mission tasks. 5.8.3.3.3.  INSTR  Evaluation  (or  any  evaluation  where  instructor  qualifications  are being  evaluated):  Instructors  receiving  an  unsatisfactory  grade  in  any  instructor area(s) will not perform instructor duties until a successful instructor requalification is completed. (T-3). 5.8.3.4.  Document restrictions on the AF Form 8 IAW paragraph 7.4.7.1 5.9.  Supervised  Status.  If  unsatisfactory  performance  or  restriction  requires  the  crewmember be  placed  on  supervised  status  with  supervision  accomplished  by  instructors  or  designated supervisors (as specified in AFI 13-1 MDS Vol. 1) qualified in the specific crew position. 5.10.  Timing of Qualification Evaluations.   38  AFI13-1STAN-EVAL2  21 JULY 2015 5.10.1.  Expiration  Date.  Required  periodic  evaluations  expire  on  the  last  day  of  the  17th month following the month in which the positional phase (and any additional training) IAW paragraph 7.4.3.1 was successfully accomplished. 5.10.2.  Eligibility  Period.  Periodic  evaluations  will  be  scheduled  in  the  eligibility  period, defined as the six-month period prior to the expiration date. 5.10.3.  Out-of-the-Eligibility Period.  On a case-by-case basis, periodic evaluations may be scheduled before or after the eligibility period according to the following criteria: 5.10.3.1.  Evaluations  Conducted  Prior  to  the  Eligibility  Period.  Unit/CCs  may authorize  individuals  to  complete  periodic  evaluations  prior  to  the  eligibility  period.  Document  Unit/CC  approval  and  the  reason  for  the  early  evaluation  to  include  but  not limited  to  deployments,  extended  TDYs,  PCS  to  a  like  MDS  unit,  and  contingency operations  on  the  AF  Form  8  under  Examiner  Remarks,  paragraph  D,  Additional Comments. (T-3). 5.10.3.2.  Extended Evaluations. 5.10.3.2.1.  HHQ Extended Evaluations.  AF/A3OY may authorize blanket or group extensions  on  an  as-required  basis.    Requests  for  extensions  at  MAJCOM  or subordinate levels are submitted IAW paragraph 1.6 (T-2). 5.10.3.2.1.1.  MAJCOM Extended Evaluations.  MAJCOM/A3 (PACAF/A8 for PACAF units) may extend evaluation expiration dates for crewmembers for up to six months.  Provide notification to AF/A3OY (NGB/A3Y for ANG units) when extensions  are  approved  (copy  to  AF/A3OY,  NGB/A3Y).    Guidance  for MAJCOM  extensions  may  be  outlined  in  MAJCOM  supplements  to  this instruction. 5.10.3.2.2.  Unit  Commander  Extended  Evaluations.  Unit/CCs  may  extend  the expiration date of periodic evaluations up to four months for the reasons listed below and will be on a case-by-case basis. (T-2).  For individual extensions longer than four months, see paragraph 5.10.3.2.1.1  For blanket or group extensions, see paragraph 5.10.3.2.1    Requisites  not  completed  during  the  original  eligibility  period  must  be completed prior to the extended expiration date.

Requirements  before  PCS/Deployment  (Note:    Applies  to  extended TDY that may preclude the member from completing a required evaluation within the prescribed eligibility period).  If a periodic evaluation will expire within three months AFI13-1STAN-EVAL2  21 JULY 2015   39  after the proposed departure for a PCS to an assignment in the same MDS, or during an upcoming deployment,  required evaluation(s) will be completed before departing for either the PCS assignment or the deployment. (T-2).  Coordinate with the gaining unit for any instances where this requirement cannot be met. 5.10.3.3.  For unit commanders and above, the approval authority is the next commander in  the  member’s  chain  of  command,  with  the  concurrence  of  the  member’s  immediate supervisor. 5.10.4.  Failure to Complete an Evaluation within the Required Period.  If a crewmember fails to complete an evaluation (ground or flight phase) within the eligibility period for an in-the-eligibility  period  evaluation  or  within  the  period  for  an  out-of-the-eligibility  period evaluation,  the  crewmember  is  downgraded  to  “UQ”  status  in  the  qualification  covered  by the evaluation and the restrictions of paragraph 5.8.3 apply. 5.10.4.1.  Qualification is re-established by a requalification evaluation. 5.10.4.2.  The Group-level  equivalent  (NAF Stan/Eval for units without a Group) in  the unit’s chain of command is the waiver authority and may approve waivers to preclude the re-accomplishment of completed requisites to complete the evaluation on a case-by-case basis.  Document such action with an MFR placed in Section II of the FEF.  Incorporate the  information  contained  in  the  MFR  onto  the  affected  AF  Form  8  under  Examiner Remarks, paragraph D, Additional Comments, when action is complete, and remove the MFR  from  the  FEF.    MFRs  become  a  permanent  part  of  the  FEF  only  when  the  Major discrepancy identified in the MFR is not addressed or corrected by a later AF Form 8. (T-3). 5.10.5.  Documentation.  Document extensions with a MFR placed in Section II of the FEF specifying extension authority, the new expiration date, and include a brief description of the extension. 5.10.5.1.  Extension MFRs are dated prior to the expiration date of any affected periodic evaluation. 5.10.5.2.  File the MFR on top of the affected AF Form 8 in Section II of the FEF. 5.10.5.3.  Requisites  not  completed  during  the  original  eligibility  period  are  completed prior to the extended expiration date indicated on the MFR. 5.10.5.4.  Incorporate the information contained in the MFR onto the affected AF Form 8 under Examiner Remarks, paragraph D, Additional Comments, when action is complete, and remove the MFR from the FEF.  Memos for record become a permanent part of the FEF only when the Major discrepancy identified in the MFR is not addressed or corrected by  a  later  AF  Form  8.    Example:    If  an  evaluation  was  extended  based  on  an  HHQ waiver,  an  MFR  will  remain  in  the  FEF  until  the  next  evaluation  is  completed.    That waiver reference is commented on in paragraph D, Additional Comments. 5.11.  Commander  Directed  Downgrade.  Any  commander  (unit  or  above)  may  direct  a downgrade  (Q-/U)  in  a  non-critical  specific  area/sub-area  without  unqualifying  an  individual.  Additionally,  a  commander  may  direct  a  downgrade  that  either  removes  a  qualification  or completely  unqualifies  an  individual.    Downgrades  may  be  directed  without  administering  an evaluation using the following guidance. (T-2):   40  AFI13-1STAN-EVAL2  21 JULY 2015 5.11.1.  For positional-related cases, use for cause only (e.g., safety).  Incidents do not have to be directly observed by an examiner, but may be recommended by an examiner from any MDS/crew position. 5.11.2.  Do not use as a substitution for, or in lieu of, administrative or judicial actions (e.g. Letter  of  Counseling,  Article  15,  etc.)    (Note:  Consult  with  the  supporting  Staff  Judge Advocate (SJA) office for legal advice in these cases).  Use in cases where such incidences directly  affect  the  commander’s  lack  of  confidence  in  the  crewmember’s  ability  to  safely operate  the  equipment  (e.g.  lapse  in  judgment  significant  enough  to  cast  doubt  on  the crewmember’s decision-making abilities). 5.11.3.  For  downgrades  that  either  remove  qualifications  or  completely  unqualify  an individual, the affected crewmember will cease performing in the qualification(s) from which they have been downgraded effective with the date the commander initiated the downgrade. (T-3). 5.11.4.  Commander-Directed  Downgrades  will  be  documented  IAW  paragraphs  7.4  and 7.5 5.12.  Alternate  Means  of  Evaluation.  When a positional  evaluation  of  a required  area is  not possible, the area may be evaluated verbally.  Examiners will make every effort to  evaluate all required  areas  on-position  during  a  L/V/C  event  before  resorting  to  this  option.    See  the appropriate  AFI  13-1  MDS  Vol.  2,  for  areas  prohibited  from  verbal/constructive  evaluation  (if applicable). AFI13-1STAN-EVAL2  21 JULY 2015   41  Chapter 6 WRITTEN EXAMINATION PROGRAM 6.1.  Purpose.  The  written  examination  program  measures  crewmember  knowledge  of  normal procedures, threats,  and  other information  essential  for the safe and effective operation of their assigned  weapon  system  through  the  administration  of  written,  computer-based,  or  electronic examinations.    Poor  testing  performance  on  examinations  indicates  areas  requiring  increased training emphasis. 6.2.  Scope.  This  chapter  applies  to  ABMs  (13BXX),  C2BMOs  (1C5/1C5D),  and  Canadian equivalent C2 operations personnel.  Examinations in this chapter include requisite examinations for  periodic  evaluations  and  unit  periodic  examinations.    Requisite  examinations  include  the General  Knowledge  examination  as  described  in  paragraph  6.4.1.    The  ability  to  focus  on specific  knowledge  areas  is  enhanced  by  the  management  of  examination  content  and  use  of appropriate master question files. 6.2.1.  For  INIT evaluations, requisite examinations will be accomplished prior to the flight phase.    For  RQ  and  periodic  evaluations,  the  written  examinations  may  be  administered before or after the flight phase. 6.3.  Administrative Procedures. 6.3.1.  ACC/A3CG will coordinate the development and maintenance and approve the CRC MQF. 6.3.2.  1AF/A3V will coordinate the development and maintenance of the MQF for CONUS BCCs and submit to ACC/A3CG for approval. 6.3.3.  PACAF/A8XI  will  coordinate  the  development  and  maintenance  and  approve  the PACAF MQF. 6.3.4.  DRUs  will  develop  and  maintain  their  MQFs  and  submit  through  channels  to ACC/A3CG for approval. 6.3.5.  Documentation.  Units  will  outline  the  unit  examination  process  in  the  unit supplement. (T-2). 6.3.6.  Computer  Based  Examinations.  Use  of  the  LMS,  PEX,  or  other  MAJCOM-approved program may fulfill the requirement for exams as outlined in this instruction. 6.3.7.  Retention  of  Examination  Records.  When  not  using  the  LMS,  PEX,  or  other MAJCOM-approved  program  for  examinations,  the  Stan/Eval  function  will  retain  graded exam answer sheets/computer records for 1 year for trend analysis purposes. 6.3.8.  When different positions are responsible for identical information, Stan/Eval may use the same examinations for these positions. 6.4.  Examination Sources. 6.4.1.  General  Knowledge  Exam.  Questions  will  come  from  MQFs  and  will  emphasize system  knowledge  and for  safe  operations  and  mission accomplishment. information  necessary   42  AFI13-1STAN-EVAL2  21 JULY 2015 6.4.1.1.  MDS-Specific MQFs.  MAJCOMs will ensure MDS-specific MQFs containing approved  questions  for  General  Knowledge  testing  are  available  for  MAJCOM  use  and distribution to applicable crew duty positions. 6.4.1.1.1.  MQF.  The  MQF  is  a  set  of  questions  applicable  to  crew  duty  positions and  based  on  the  weapons  system/unit  mission.    The  questions  are  derived  from operational  publications  and  MAJCOM  training  materials.    This  question  file  and sources will be accessible to all unit operations personnel. 6.4.1.1.1.1.  Units  may  edit  MQFs  to  accommodate  local  testing  procedures, administrative  errors  and  reflect  recent  changes  to  systems  and/or  operational procedures; however, subject matter may not be changed. 6.4.1.1.1.2.  For  MAJCOM  MQFs,  the  unit  Chief  of  Stan/Eval  is  authorized  to make  corrections,  change  spelling,  or  correct  erroneous  or  invalid  questions resulting  from  recent  changes  to  systems  and/or  operational  procedures.    These corrections and any new questions resulting from revisions/changes to directives will  be  submitted  in  writing  through  Stan/Eval  channels  to  the  MAJCOM  OPR within  10  days  after  implementation  (T-2).    The  unit  Chief  of  Stan/Eval  will maintain a file copy of all recommendations until the next update is accomplished (T-3). 6.4.1.1.2.  Units  will  forward  recommended  changes,  through  channels,  of  MQF questions to the appropriate MAJCOM OPR. (T-2). 6.4.1.2.  Local  Procedures  MQF  (LPMQF).  Local  Procedures  MQFs  will  be  used  to supplement the MAJCOM-approved MQF.  Units may include any information necessary for  safe  operation  and  mission  accomplishment  not  included  in  the  MAJCOM  MQF.  Local  instructions,  range  procedures,  unit  supplements  to  AFI  13-1  MDS-Vol.  3,  are examples  of  sources  for  the  Local  Procedures  MQF.    At  least  15  percent  of  QUAL General Knowledge examination questions will come from the LPMQF. (T-3). 6.4.2.  Examination  Question  Review.  The  MAJCOM,  NAF,  Group,  and  unit  Stan/Eval function will review all MQFs, and generated exams (if used) annually and after any changes in source documents.  Units will document their procedures for the exam reviews in their unit supplement. (T-2). 6.5.  Examination  Management.  Units  will  either  maintain  requisite  examinations  for  each crew position or generate a unique test for each crewmember requiring an exam. (T-2). 6.5.1.  If requisite examinations are maintained for each crew position: 6.5.1.1.  Unit Stan/Eval will maintain two General Knowledge tests on file for each duty position. (T-3). 6.5.1.2.  Requisite  examinations  for  each  crew  position  will  normally  be  generated  and stored on the LMS, PEX, or other MAJCOM-approved system. 6.5.2.  QUAL  Examination.  General Knowledge.  The written test for a QUAL evaluation will be IAW AFI 13-1 MDS Vol. 2 and consist of 85 questions from the MAJCOM MQF and 15 questions from the LPMQF. AFI13-1STAN-EVAL2  21 JULY 2015   43  6.5.3.  QUAL/MSN  Examination.  General  Knowledge.    Crew  position  written  test  for  a combined QUAL/MSN evaluation will be IAW AFI 13-1 MDS Vol. 2.  If the unit chooses to require  a  MSN  requisite  exam  in  addition  to  the  QUAL  requisite  exam  the  unit  will  define the amount of questions and the source of the questions in the unit supplement.  Document QUAL requisite examinations on a separate line from MSN requisite examinations on the AF Form 8.  Do not combine QUAL requisite examinations and MSN requisite examinations. 6.5.4.  Review  all  examinations  for  accuracy  annually,  as  a  minimum,  and  after  any applicable publication changes.  Units will report the review in the SEB minutes. 6.5.5.  USAFAWC  Weapons  Director  (WD)  written  examinations  will  consist  of  50 questions  from  the  MQF  and  50  locally  developed  questions  from  the  57  WG  MQF  that address local procedures.  No more than 25 of the 57 WG MQF questions will be fill-in-the-blank. 6.5.6.  DRUs will define their QUAL exam criteria in their unit supplement. (T-3). 6.5.6.1.  DRUs are responsible for developing and maintaining their specific MQFs. 6.5.6.2.  DRUs are to develop and maintain a minimum of two requisite examinations for each crew position. 6.5.6.3.  DRU MQFs will be coordinated through channels for MAJCOM approval. 6.6.  Examination  Security.  Stan/Eval  personnel  will maintain positive control of all requisite exams,  applicable  answer  sheets  and  associated  computer  based/electronic  media.    To  prevent compromise when not in use, secure examinations, and answer keys in a locked container. 6.6.1.  The overall classification of the MQF is determined by the highest classification of its contents. 6.6.2.  Classify test questions extracted from the MQF according to their classification in the MQF.    Mark  tests  appropriately  and  protect  them  IAW  security  directives.    Whether  they contain classified questions or not, handle the tests as controlled items. 6.7.  Grading.  The  minimum  passing  grade  for  all  Stan/Eval  requisite  examinations  is  85 percent.    Grade  all  examinations  prior  to  the  individual's  next  scheduled  period  for  performing operations duties.  All questions missed will be reviewed immediately following the exam. 6.8.  Failure  to  Pass  a  Requisite  Exam.  An  evaluation  will  not  be  complete  until  the examination  is  successfully  accomplished.    When  an  individual  fails  a  written  examination, Stan/Eval  will notify the unit CC, DO and COT in  writing.  The notification will state that the individual  may  only  perform  positional  duties  when  supervised  by  an  instructor  in  that  crew position  and  also  requires  retesting.    The  initial  failure  on  a  recurring  periodic  examination results in Non-Combat Mission Ready (NCMR)/Non-Basic Mission Capable (NBMC) status. 6.8.1.  Reexamination Policy.  Any crewmember failing a requisite examination at any time must  be  afforded  an  adequate  study  period  (at  least  24  hours)  prior  to  reexamination.    An alternate exam will be used.  Failure of the reexamination will result in a downgrade to “UQ” status  or retention  in training status  for  INIT examination.  The AF Form  8 will be used to document the second failure as a SPOT “Q3”. 6.8.1.1.  Conduct required training IAW AFI 13-1MDS Vol. 1 as applicable.   44  AFI13-1STAN-EVAL2  21 JULY 2015 6.8.2.  Reexamination  Period.  Crewmembers  who  fail  a  requisite  examination  must complete  a  successful  reexamination  within  the  30  day  (2  UTAs  (for  BCC  units  the  UTA periods only apply to DSG)) additional training period following the date of the first failure, or  the  end  of  their  eligibility  period,  whichever  occurs  first.    The  unit/CC  may  extend  the time allowed to successfully complete the examination.  This extension is documented IAW Chapter 7. 6.8.3.  Supervised  Status.  Crewmembers  who  fail  a  requisite  examination  must  be supervised by an instructor until successful retesting is completed. (T-3). 6.8.3.1.  For  crewmembers  who  maintain  multiple  qualifications,  supervised  status resulting from failure of the examination applies only to the crew position for which the examination was administered. 6.9.  Unit Periodic Examinations.  (Optional)  Each group/unit Stan/Eval function may conduct periodic  testing  of  all  crews.    The  intent  of  this  testing  is  to  evaluate  additional  knowledge beyond the scope of requisite exams, such as a cross-section of general knowledge, tactical/threat knowledge,  and/or  operational  procedures,  etc.,  to  determine  if  knowledge  deficiencies  exist within the unit. 6.9.1.  This  exam  may  be  open  or  closed  book,  but  will  not  count  as  a  requisite  exam,  nor will a requisite exam satisfy the requirement for a periodic exam. 6.9.2.  If utilized, units will describe this program in the unit supplement to this instruction, to include procedures for failed exams. (T-2). AFI13-1STAN-EVAL2  21 JULY 2015   45  Chapter 7 DOCUMENTATION 7.1.  Scope.  Effective  management  of  the  qualification  evaluation  program  requires  accurate administrative documentation.  The qualifications and authorizations for which a crewmember is to  be  evaluated  are  determined  from  unit  historical  qualification  documentation.    This  chapter provides  documentation  guidance  for  members  that  require  an  evaluation  to  establish  a qualification. 7.1.1.  The results of evaluations are recorded on the AF Form 8.  The chronological history of  evaluations  for  a  crewmember  is  recorded  on  an  AF  Form  942,  Record  of  Evaluation.  Only use last 4 of the individual’s Social Security  Account  Number  (SSAN).  These  forms are maintained in the FEF. 7.1.2.  In all instances of documentation, use of electronic forms is authorized, to include use of  Common  Access  Card  (CAC)-enabled  signatures  and  wholly  electronic  FEFs  IAW MAJCOM supplement guidance.  Computer-generated forms need not be in the exact format of  AF  Forms  published  on  the  Air  Force  e-Publishing  website  but  must  provide  the  same information. 7.1.2.1.  PEX  generated  AF  Form  8  and  AF  Form  942  is  authorized.    PEX  formatting rules on the AF Form 8 are authorized with the following known differences not required to be documented as minor discrepancies.  These discrepancies are to be reported to the PEX Help Desk for future updates to the program. 7.1.2.1.1.  Additional/missing carriage returns. 7.1.2.1.2.  PEX  breaking  out  Discrepancies  and  Additional  Training  into  "Ground" and "Flight." 7.1.2.1.3.  PEX  substitution  of  the  word  "Sortie"  for  "Event"  under  Mission Description (i.e. First Sortie, Second Sortie, etc.). 7.1.2.1.4.  Reviewing  Officer  and  Approving  Officer  remarks  are  added  to  CC Directed Downgrade. 7.1.2.1.5.  PEX  generates  an  AF  Form  8  with  the  "RESTRICTIONS"  box  and  the "CC DIRECTED DOWNGRADE" box checked at the same time. 7.1.2.1.6.  PEX generates a CC-Directed AF Form 8 with the first line in Section IV as “RESTRICTION:” 7.1.2.1.7.  PEX  generates  an  AF  Form  8  with  two-digit  day,  three-letter  month  and two-digit year format (e.g. 09 Mar 15) as the date format. 7.2.  Letter of X or Letter of Qualification. 7.2.1.  The  Letter  of  X  or  Qualification  provides  a  snapshot  of  the  qualifications  and Examiner Certifications of crewmembers at the time of approval by the unit commander. 7.2.1.1.  The  unit  commander  may  restrict  a  qualification  and  certification  of  a crewmember  by  not  listing  a  qualification  or  certification  listed  in  the  crewmember’s FEF.   46  AFI13-1STAN-EVAL2  21 JULY 2015 7.2.2.  The Letter of X or Qualification will be published IAW the unit supplement that will define at a minimum: 7.2.2.1.  Unit OPR. 7.2.2.2.  Frequency of publication. 7.2.2.3.  Review/approval process. 7.2.3.  The  Letter  of  X  or  Qualification  will  include  but  not  limited  to  the  following information: 7.2.3.1.  Name,  rank,  date  of  last  evaluation(s),  evaluation  expiration  date(s),  instructor, evaluator, duty positions (primary, secondary, etc.), BMC/CMR status, and qualification and certification. 7.3.  Qualifications  and  Certifications.  Qualifications  are  attained  through  evaluations  and documented  on  the  AF  Form  8.    Certifications  attained  through  methods  other  than  evaluation (i.e. commander certifications) are documented IAW AFI 13-1 MDS Vol. 1. 7.4.  AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification.  The AF Form 8 is the source document used to record and verify the qualification of a crewmember and the following should be used as a guide to effectively complete the form. 7.4.1.  The  examinee’s  AF  Form  8  is  not  considered  accomplished  until  the  following individuals  have  annotated  appropriate  remarks  if  required  and  provided  signatures; Examiner(s),  the  Reviewing  Officer,  Final  Approving  Officer  (Exception:   For  a Commander-Directed  Downgrade  AF  Form  8,  only  the  commander  signs  as  the  Final Approving Officer), and the examinee. 7.4.2.  General Data Entry.  See Attachment 3 for sample AF Form 8s. 7.4.2.1.  In all instances of data entry, if an electronic form is used, the format required by the electronic form will be used (paragraph 7.1.2). 7.4.2.1.1.  For  date  fields  use  a  two-digit  day,  three-letter  month  and  two-digit  year format (e.g. 09 Aug 15). 7.4.2.2.  The “Eligibility Period” and “Expiration Date of Qualification” will use a three-letter  month  and  two-digit  year  format  (Aug  15).    If  the  eligibility  period  spans  over  a calendar year then both years are indicated (e.g. Dec 14 – May 15, Jan – Jun 15). 7.4.2.3.  To  facilitate  the  entry  of  data  on  the  form,  except  where  specifically  noted otherwise, use upper and lower case letters. 7.4.2.4.  Requirements  for  font,  indentation,  and  justification  (right,  left,  or  centered)  of data  are  not  specified.    MAJCOM  supplements  may  direct  specific  format  standards  as desired. 7.4.2.5.  Units may use the standard format established by the PEX Stan/Eval module AF Form 8.  Digitally signed (CAC-enabled signatures) AF Form 8s are authorized. 7.4.2.6.  Units  without  access  to  the  PEX  Stan/Eval  module  AF  Form  8  may  use  the  e-Publishing  AF  Form  8  with  CAC  digital  signature  ability  and  route  the  AF  Form  8 through encrypted emails for CAC digital signatures. AFI13-1STAN-EVAL2  21 JULY 2015   47  7.4.3.

For FTU courses in which an evaluation is administered, the organization and location will reflect the FTU organization/location. 7.4.4.3.  Crew Position. 7.4.4.3.1.  Enter  the  MDS  in  which  the  evaluation  was  given  by  using  MDS designators. 7.4.4.3.2.  Enter  the  examinee's  duty  position  for  the  evaluation  in  that  particular MDS.  For instructors the crew position will be prefaced with an “I”.  For examiners and  the  objectivity  evaluations,  the  crew  position  will  be  prefaced  with  an  “E”.    In cases  where  confusion  may  exist  a  hyphen  may  be  inserted  (i.e.  an  Electronic Protection  Technician  (EPT)  objectivity  would  be  an  (E-EPT  or  an  ICT  Instructor would be I-ICT). 7.4.4.4.  Eligibility Period. 7.4.4.4.1.  Enter  the  6-month  period  preceding  the  expiration  date  from  the  last similar periodic qualification evaluation (e.g., if the last MSN evaluation expires Sep 15, enter Apr-Sep 15). 7.4.4.4.2.  Enter N/A (not applicable) for INIT, SPOT, RQ, and out-of-the-eligibility period evaluations. 7.4.4.4.3.

Additionally, the electronic FEF must be transportable. 7.7.3.  Contents.  Divide the FEF into two sections: 7.7.3.1.   (left side).  This section contains AF Form 942s; MAJCOM required items and those items authorized by the unit supplement to this instruction (e.g., logs of initial and annual reviews).  Section I may contain two sub-sections. 7.7.3.1.1.  AF Form 942s will be placed on top in chronological order with the most recent  on  top.    Place  qualifications,  authorizations,  and/or  cross-references  to  such documents. 7.7.3.1.2.  Any  additional  information  as  directed  by  MAJCOM  and/or  unit supplement will be placed under the AF Form 942. 7.7.3.1.3.  If used, file backup electronic storage media in Section I of the FEF. 7.7.3.1.4.  If the FEF is not maintained at the same base with the individual’s training record, a copy of the most recent DD Form 2992, may be filed in this section behind any MAJCOM and/or unit directed items. 7.7.3.2.    (right  side).  This  section  contains  AF  Form  8s  and  any  related  MFRs  for  all evaluations  listed  on  the  AF  Form  942  in  Section  I.    For  individuals  who  maintain qualifications  in  more  than  one  crew  position  in  the  same  MDS,  tabs  will  be  used  to identify primary, secondary, tertiary, etc. crew positions. 7.7.3.2.1.  File  AF  Form  8s  in  chronological  order  with  the  most  recent  on  top.  Individuals  who  maintain  qualification  in  two  or  more  crew  positions  in  the  same MDS will file AF Form 8s in chronological order within the applicable tab. 7.7.3.2.1.1.  If a qualification is dropped, CCV will move the affected AF Form 8s into  the  “Other  Crew  Positions”  tab  (filing  each  AF  Form  8  in  chronological order). AFI13-1STAN-EVAL2  21 JULY 2015   59  7.7.3.2.1.1.1.  Use of tabs within section II is optional for units using PEX. 7.7.3.2.2.  MFRs. 7.7.3.2.2.1.

Periodic review of FEFs for personnel in inactive status is not required. 7.7.5.3.2.  The  interval  between  reviews  will  not  exceed  the  qualification  period window. 7.7.5.3.3.  Document  the  periodic  review  on  AF  Form  942  IAW  unit  and/or MAJCOM  supplement.    Type  “Review”  in  Type  of  Evaluation  block  followed  by date the review was accomplished in the date block. 7.7.6.  FEF Discrepancies.  FEF discrepancies include those of the AF Form 8 and AF Form 942 and any MAJCOM-directed documentation. 7.7.6.1.  Major  Discrepancies.  Discrepancies that alter the qualification of the affected crewmember. 7.7.6.1.1.  Major discrepancies are documented on a permanent MFR filed in Section II  immediately  above  the  affected  AF  Form  8  or  in  chronological  order  for  items other than those found on AF Form 8s.  Major discrepancy MFR’s will be signed by the unit CC.  Once a later AF Form 8 corrects the major discrepancy, the MFR will be removed from the FEF IAW paragraph 7.4.7.3.5.7 7.7.6.1.2.  MFRs  documenting  similar  major  discrepancies  found  on  multiple  AF Form 8s will be filed on top of the latest affected AF Form 8. 7.7.6.2.  Minor  Discrepancies.  Discrepancies  that  do  not  alter  the  qualification  of  the affected crewmember (e.g. typos, formatting, and misspellings). 7.7.6.2.1.  Minor discrepancies are documented on a non-permanent record as defined by  the  MAJCOM  or  unit  supplement  to  this  instruction  and  need  not  reside  in  the FEF. 7.7.6.3.

Effective date of rescission 8.2.2.6.  Subject Matter Expert (SME)/point of contact (POC) for further information 8.2.3.  SIIs will be of limited duration to maintain the focus.  If the situation for which the SII was  issued  remains,  consideration  should  be  given  to  amending  current  procedures  and issuing corrective action via a command message or Read File item. AFI13-1STAN-EVAL2  21 JULY 2015   65  8.2.4.  SIIs may be issued/rescinded by HAF, MAJCOM, NAF, and unit level.  If issued from agencies  outside  the  MAJCOMs  (e.g.  HAF,  but  not  subordinate  NAFs  or  units),  the  lead MAJCOM  Stan/Eval  function  will  coordinate  the  intent  and  verbiage  of  the  SII  with  other MAJCOM  Stan/Eval  functions  in  order  to  determine  the  level  of  applicability  within  the individual MAJCOMs prior to release. 8.2.5.  Units  will  place  all  applicable  SIIs  into  the  OIF,  Current  Read  File,  Part  B,  for dissemination to crewmembers (T-3). 8.2.6.  All  current  MDS-specific  SIIs  will  be  briefed  during  the  crew  briefings  for  the duration  of  the  SII(s).    Mission-specific  SIIs  need  only  be  briefed  on  those  missions  for which the SII is relevant. 8.3.  Go/No-Go  Procedures.  Units  will  establish  a  positive  control  system  that  ensures crewmembers  have  completed  all items  required  for  mission accomplishment (T-3).  Units will provide guidance on this program in the unit supplement (T-3). training  and  Stan/Eval 8.3.1.  As a minimum, the Go/No Go program will monitor (T-3): 8.3.1.1.  AF Form 8 qualifications. 8.3.1.2.  Lookback and currency requirements outlined in AFI 13-1 MDS, Vol. 1 or RAP Tasking Memorandum. 8.3.1.3.  Restrictions/Supervised status. 8.3.1.4.  Any DNIC status. 8.3.1.5.  Currency on all OIF (Volume 1, Part B) items. 8.3.1.6.  Use  the  Go/No-Go  procedures  to  document  the  currency,  review,  certification, and acknowledgment of Volume 1 Part B information by crewmembers. 8.3.2.  Units  will  designate  personnel  to  verify  Go/No-Go  status  prior  to  releasing crewmembers for any scheduled mission (T-3). 8.4.  Supplementary Evaluations. 8.4.1.  Supplementary  evaluations  are  administrative  tools  used  by  a  commander  to  ensure standardization  of  operations  and  to  identify  and  evaluate  implemented  solutions  to operational  problems.    The  form  and  content  of  supplementary  evaluations  are  at  the discretion of the commander and outlined in the unit supplement. 8.4.2.  Supplementary evaluations are not qualification evaluations. 8.4.3.  Commanders will determine evaluated areas.  The Stan/Eval  function will determine the  period  and  method  of  evaluation  and  is  responsible  for  administrative  management  of data collection, and will report results as directed by the commander (T-3). 8.4.4.  Individuals  other  than  examiners,  as  determined  by  the  commander,  may  assist  in conducting supplementary evaluations. 8.4.5.  Supplementary  evaluations  may  be  administered  in  conjunction  with  a  positional evaluation.  For example, an examiner may perform a positional supplementary evaluation of   66  AFI13-1STAN-EVAL2  21 JULY 2015 the  WD's  handover  coordination  procedures  while  conducting  a  complete  qualification evaluation of a WD. 8.4.6.  If conducted on position, supplementary evaluations should not be documented on an AF Form 8. 8.4.7.  The focus of any  positional  supplementary evaluation  should be one specific area of operations such as radio  transmissions, pre-mission briefings, or checklist use.  These areas are provided as examples and are not intended to be used as mandatory areas to be inspected.  Specific  areas  of  emphasis  are  needed  so  that  data  logged  during  positional  supplementary evaluations may be used to identify trends or deficiencies as well as their cause. 8.4.8.  The  Chief  of  Stan/Eval  will  accomplish  the  following  when  a  specific  area  is identified for a positional supplementary evaluation (T-3): 8.4.8.1.  Outline  the  specific  objectives  of  the  evaluation  and  ensure  development  of checklists for use by examiners. 8.4.8.2.  Determine an adequate time frame in order to achieve the objectives. 8.4.8.3.  Notify  operations  personnel  of  the  evaluation  objectives  and  time  frame  for evaluation. 8.4.8.4.  Ensure examiners record the results of each evaluation. 8.4.8.5.  Consolidate the information obtained during the evaluation period. 8.4.8.6.  Evaluate the results and determine if corrective actions should be recommended. 8.4.8.7.  Report  positional  supplementary  evaluation  results  to  the  commander  through the DO.  The report will include the objectives of the evaluation, the time frame during which it was performed, discrepancies that were  noted, recommended  corrective action, and suspense dates for completion of corrective action.  The DO approves and endorses all recommendations for corrective actions. 8.4.8.8.  Perform follow-up to ensure that completed corrective action was effective. 8.4.9.  Supplementary evaluation results will be documented in SEB minutes. 8.4.10.  Retain  a  copy  of  positional  supplementary  evaluation  reports  and  checklists developed for at least one year.

IAW AFI 90-201, the self-assessment checklist (SAC) is the two-way communication tool designed  to  improve  compliance  with  published  guidance  and  is  a  critical  part  of  the Commander’s Inspection Program (CCIP).  The SACs are based upon the governing Air Force Instruction allowing unit leadership to monitor and report compliance and non-compliance with SACs through MICT.  Unit commanders and HHQ functional managers throughout the chain of command monitor programs for near real-time compliance and trends using MICT.  Compliance with the items in a SAC does not relieve unit leadership from knowing the requirements of their programs and complying with guidance in Air Force Instructions and other policy documents. A8.1.1.  MAJCOM/IG use of SACs.  SACs are not  inspection checklists.  SACs are one of many resources MAJCOM/IGs may choose to use to complete inspection requirements. A8.1.2.  Units  will  conduct  a  self-assessment  utilizing  the  SACs  on  MICT  at  least  once annually (T-2).
