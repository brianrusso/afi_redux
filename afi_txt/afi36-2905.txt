It is every Airman’s responsibility to maintain the standards set forth in this AFI 365 days  a  year.  Being  physically  fit  allows  you  to  properly  support  the  Air  Force  mission.    The goal  of  the  Fitness  Program  (FP)  is  to  motivate  all  members  to  participate  in  a  year-round physical  conditioning  program  that  emphasizes  total  fitness,  to  include  proper  aerobic conditioning,  muscular  fitness  training,  and  healthy  eating.    An  active  lifestyle  will  increase productivity,  optimize  health,  and  decrease  absenteeism  while  maintaining  a  higher  level  of readiness.    Commanders  and  supervisors  must  incorporate  fitness  into  the  Air  Force  culture establishing  an  environment  for  members  to  maintain  physical  fitness  and  health  to  meet expeditionary mission requirements.  The Fitness Assessment (FA) provides commanders with a tool  to  assist  in  the  determination  of  overall  fitness  of  their  military  personnel.    Commander-driven physical fitness training is the backbone of the Air Force Fitness Program and an integral part  of  mission  requirements.    The  program  promotes  aerobic  and  muscular  fitness,  flexibility, and optimal body composition of each member in the unit.   8  AFI36-2905  21 OCTOBER 2013 Chapter 2 RESPONSIBILITIES  2.1.

Notifing  the  UFPM,  designated  FAC  representative,  or  superior  authority,  in writing (includes e-mail) of the need to schedule the FA and requests that it be scheduled immediately for accomplishment within the required window, if not scheduled in a period required to remain current. 2.31.2.3.  Remaining  current  as  defined  in  paragraph  3.12.    It  is  the  commander’s discretion  to  annotate  a  non-current/failing  FA  within  the  reporting  period  on  the evaluation.  Additionally, it is the commander’s discretion to document the evaluation as a  referral  for  a  non-current/failing  FA  at  the  evaluation  close-out  date  or  EPR  SCOD.  NOTE:    See  Table  A14.1.  and  A14.2.  for  mandatory  and  optional  commander  actions upon FA failure. 2.31.2.4.  Monitoring  any  personal  FA  exemptions,  scheduling  all  necessary  medical appointments, and initiating FA test arrangements in a timely manner. 2.31.2.5.  Seeking  medical  evaluation/intervention  if  a  medical  condition  is  believed  to impact his/her ability to complete the FA. 2.31.3.  Completes  FSQ  IAW  paragraph  3.3.2.    (T-1).    If  the  Airman  arrives  at  the  FAC without a FSQ, the FAC staff/augmentee will ensure the Airman completes a FSQ for review before the FA is administered.  NOTE: Failure to complete FSQ does not invalidate the FA.  FAC will document any cases where FSQ is not complete and attach to FA.  (T-1). 2.31.3.1.  Upon  completion  of  the  FSQ,  provide  a  copy  of  the  FSQ  to  the  UFPM  and FAC member prior to the FA. 2.31.3.2.  If the Airman has a medical condition or identifies a medical condition on the FSQ that would limit him/her from completing all components of the FA and he/she does not  have  a  current  AF  Form  469  documenting  FA  exemptions,  the  Airman  must  notify his/her UFPM and schedule an appointment with his/her MTF (ANG MLO).  A new FA appointment must be scheduled within 5 duty days (90 days for ANG) of the original FA date.  NOTE:  If no FA appointments are available within this timeframe, Airman must be  scheduled  for  first  available  FA  appointment  and  notify  their  UFPM.  Failure  to comply with this direction will be addressed by Airman’s leadership. 2.31.3.3.  Notifies UFPM upon receiving an AF Form 469 from healthcare provider with Fitness Restrictions and/or Fitness Assessment Exemptions IAW AFI 10-203.

Will  acknowledge  FA  component  results  by  signing  a  hard  copy  AF  Form  4446 following completion of the FA.  (T-1).  Refusal to sign the scorecard does not invalidate the FA results. 2.31.7.  Will  wear  the  Air  Force  PT  uniform  to  complete  all  components  of  the  FA  IAW          AFI  36-2903,  Dress  and  Personal  Appearance  of  Air  Force  Personnel.    NOTE:    Due  to operational  requirements  AFOSI  special  agents  are  authorized  to  complete  official  fitness assessments without meeting dress and appearance requirements as outlined in AFI 36-2903 , but  must  be  capable  of  providing  documentation  to  confirm  grooming  waiver  is  in  effect.  AFOSI agents in this status may wear suitable civilian PT clothing during testing. 2.31.8.  ARC  Airmen  must  ensure  they  are  in  an  approved  military  status  for  FAs.    (T-1).  Appropriate military duty status for FAs is IAW AFI 36-2254,V1.  FAs may be performed in the  following  statuses:  active  duty  status:    Annual  Tour  (AT),  Initial  Active  Duty  Training (IADT),  Proficiency  Training  (PT),  Reserve  Personnel  Appropriation  (RPA)/Military Personnel  Appropriation  (MPA),  Reserve  Management  Period  (RMP),  and  School  Tour;  inactive duty status:  Inactive Duty Training (IDTs) and Unit Training Assemblies (UTAs). 2.31.8.1.  No  other  duty  status,  i.e.,  Equivalent  Reserve  Instruction  (ERI),  Equivalent Training  (ET),  Additional  Training  Period  (ATP),  Additional  Flying  Training  Period (AFTP), Ground Training Period (GTP), etc., is  an appropriate status to  be used for the performance of the FA requirement. 2.31.9.  Understand and comply with the guidelines contained in AFI 44-102, Medical Care Management regarding the use of weight control drugs and surgery.   24  AFI36-2905  21 OCTOBER 2013 Chapter 3 FITNESS ASSESSMENT  3.1.  General.  The  AF  uses  an  overall  composite  fitness  score  and  minimum  scores  per component  based  on  aerobic  fitness,  body  composition,  and  muscular  fitness  components  to determine overall fitness.  Members must earn a composite score of 75 or greater, and meet the component  minimums  identified  in  Attachment  10  (and  Attachment  12  if  taking  the  2.0 kilometer  walk  test).    (T-1).    NOTE:    Airmen  will  be  tested  against  performance  standards  by gender reflected in MilPDS. 3.1.1.  Scoring.  Minimum component points do not constitute the minimum required to earn a  composite  passing  score  and  points  below  the  required  minimum  component  values  read zero.    Scoring  the  minimum  component  points  in  all  FA  components  will  not  generate enough  points  to  earn  a  composite  score  of  75  or  greater.    The  minimum  components  are established to ensure that members test adequately in all components rather than excelling in some and disregarding others. 3.1.2.  Target values are designed to illustrate a combination of component points which would equal an overall 75 composite score.  Airmen failing to meet a target component value,  but  still  scoring  at  or  above  the  minimum  component  point  value  (lowest “fitness/health  risk”  limit),  can  still  pass  the  assessment  by  exceeding  targets  in  other components. 3.1.3.  Overall  fitness  is  directly  related  to  health  risk,  including  risk  of  disease  and  death.  Health  and  readiness  benefits  increase  as  aerobic  fitness,  body  composition,  and  muscular fitness improve with increases in physical activity. 3.1.4.  A  FA  will  be  deemed  official  or  unofficial  prior  to  the  administration  of  the  first component.  A FA started as official cannot be changed to unofficial during administration.  Likewise, a FA started as unofficial cannot be changed to official. 3.2.  Fitness Assessment Components. 3.2.1.  Body composition component. 3.2.1.1.  Evaluated by abdominal circumference (AC) measurements. 3.2.2.  Aerobic component. 3.2.2.1.  Evaluated by the 1.5-mile timed run. 3.2.2.2.  Alternative Aerobic Test:  Members not medically cleared to complete the 1.5-mile run will be assessed by the 2.0-kilometer walk as determined by the PCM or ANG MLO unless otherwise exempted. 3.2.3.  Muscular fitness component. 3.2.3.1.  Evaluated by number of push-ups and sit-ups completed within 1 minute. 3.3.  Fitness  Assessment  Requirements.  FAC augmentees will conduct the FA for all Airmen (RegAF,  AFR,  and  ANG),  (except  basic  military  and  technical  training  students,  tested  by training cadre PTLs/MTLs IAW paragraph 7.1.3) and will support FAs for ARC tenant units at  RegAF  installations  to  include  UTA  weekends.    (T-1).    Installations  will  develop  a  local  plan, AFI36-2905  21 OCTOBER 2013   25  signed  by  the  Installation  Commander,  for  Unit  Commanders  to  appoint  PTLs  and  UFPMs  to augment the FAC for the purpose of administering FAs.  (T-3).  FAC augmentees will conduct FAs and the designated FAC Manager will provide oversight.  (T-1).  FAC augmentees will not test Airmen from their own unit/PAS  code.   (T-1).   FA scores  will only  be updated by  Fitness and Sports Center personnel, or designated UFPMs/FAC augmentees per local guidance.  (T-3).  NOTE:  UFPMs/FAC  augmentees  will  not  update  FA  scores  in  AFFMS  II  for  personnel  from their own unit/PAS code.  (T-1).  Fitness Center staff should not be used to augment the FAC to conduct FAs. 3.3.1.  FA  procedures  training  will  cover  official  testing  procedures,  using  the  AF/A1 approved  standardized  slides,  and  will  not  be  deviated  from  under  any  circumstances.  UFPMs  and  PTLs  augmenting  the  FAC  must  possess  PTL-B  certification  and  complete refresher FA procedure training prior to administering any FAs as a FAC augmentee. 3.3.2.  All  members  must  complete  the  FSQ  (Attachment  4)  and  provide  it  to  their  UFPM (Wing FPM for ANG) for review prior to FA.  If the member arrives at the FAC without a FSQ,  the  FAC  will  ensure  the  member  completes  a  FSQ  for  review  before  the  FA  is administered.    NOTE:    Failure  to  complete  FSQ  does  not  invalidate  the  FA.    FAC  will document any cases where FSQ is not complete and attach to FA. 3.3.2.1.  The FSQ will be completed no earlier than 30 calendar days (90 days for ARC), but NLT 7 days prior to FA to provide time for medical evaluation, when indicated. 3.3.2.2.  A  medical  provider  must  evaluate  all  members  with  health  issues  identified  on the FSQ prior to the FA.  If any item on the FSQ indicates a condition which might limit performance of any component of the FA, and there is not an accompanying current AF Form  469,  the  UFPM  will  refer  the  member  for  medical  evaluation.    The  member  will carry the FSQ to the medical evaluation.  The provider or ARC MLO will complete and sign the appropriate place on the FSQ, and complete an AF Form 469 if applicable, and the member will return the FSQ to the UFPM and/or FAC. 3.4.  Assessment Procedures. 3.4.1.  All  components  of  the  FA  must  be  completed  within  a  3-hour  window  on  the  same day.    If  FAC  staff/augmentees  determine  extenuating  circumstances  prevent  completion  of the test (e.g., rapidly changing or severe weather conditions, emergencies, injury during FA, or  travel  time  needed  to  complete  other  components  at  alternate  locations,  etc…)  then  all components must be rescheduled and completed at the earliest opportunity, but within 5 duty days.  ARC members must be in military duty status for assessments.  ARC Airmen will be required to  retest the next  date they are in  appropriate military  duty status  and official  FAs are being conducted. 3.4.2.  Airmen only have one opportunity to complete each of the FA components per FA.  If an  Airman  refuses  to  complete  their  FA  due  to  failing  to  meet  the  minimum  in  one  or multiple components, their incomplete FA will still count and be updated in AFFMS II.  (T-1)  Scores for all components are final when entered into AFFMS II. 3.4.2.1.  Illness or injury during the FA.  If an Airman becomes injured or ill during the FA,  he/she  will  have  the  option  of  being  evaluated  at  the  Medical  Treatment  Facility (MTF) whether they complete the FA or not.  Before departing the test location, Airmen must notify the FAC of the presence of illness/injury by checking the illness/injury block   26  AFI36-2905  21 OCTOBER 2013 on the AF Form 4446. NOTE:  ARC Airmen must promptly report any medical condition (i.e.  disease,  injury,  operative  procedure  or  hospitalization,  etc)  that  might  impact  their utilization  and  readiness  to  his  or  her  commander,  supervisor,  or  supporting  military medical  facility  personnel.    Each  commander  and  supervisor  must  notify  the  servicing medical  facility  when  he/she  becomes  aware  of  any  changes  in  an  ARC  member’s medical  status  including  any  medical  condition  that  occurred  during  the  FA  and/or prevented the member from completing the FA.  Any concealment or claim of disability proven  to  be  made  with  the  intent  to  defraud  the  government  may  result  in  appropriate punitive action under the Uniform Code of Military Justice or appropriate administrative action. 3.4.2.1.1.  If an Airman checks the illness/injury block of the AF Form 4446, the FAC staff (or UFPM where no FAC exists) will sign the form acknowledging that they will hold  scores  to  allow  for  medical  evaluation  and  Commander  review.    (T-1).  Additionally, the FAC staff will transmit a copy of the AF Form 4446 to the UFPM for the Unit Commander’s review within two duty days.  (T-1).  For RegAF and AGR Airmen,  the  FAC  (or  UFPM  where  no  FAC  exists)  will  enter  the  FA  results  in AFFMS II on the 6th duty day if the Commander does not invalidate test results or no response  from  the  Commander  is  received  within  this  timeframe.    (T-1).    For  non-AGR  and  Traditional  ARC  Airmen,  the  FAC  (or  UFPM  where  no  FAC  exists)  will enter scores into AFFMS II at the conclusion of the next UTA if the Commander does not invalidate the test results or no response from the Commander is received within this timeframe.  (T-1). 3.4.2.1.2.  If the medical evaluation validates the illness/injury (Attachment 15), the Unit  Commander  may  invalidate  the  FA  results  by  checking  the  “I  render  this  test invalid” block of the AF Form 4446, signing, and returning the form to the FAC.  If the  FA  is  invalidated,  the  Airman  will  be  required  to  retest  on  all  non-exempt  FA components within five duty days from original FA test date.  If an AF Form 469 is required,  an  additional  five  duty  days  from  medical  evaluation  date  will  be  allowed for the AF Form 469 to be generated and provided.  Non-AGR and Traditional ARC Airmen  will  be  required  to  retest  the  next  date  they  are  in  appropriate  military  duty status and official FAs are being conducted.    NOTE:  Original FA will count unless rendered invalid by the Unit Commander. 3.4.2.1.3.  Airmen  will  notify  their  Commander  within  one  duty  day  of  the  FA regarding the injury/illness to ensure communication regarding test validity with the MTF and FAC staff occurs prior to score entry into AFFMS II.  (T-1). 3.4.3.  Body composition  (height,  weight,  and AC) must be the first  component  assessed in the FA. 3.4.4.  The muscular fitness components (push-ups and sit-ups) may be accomplished before or after the 1.5-mile run or 2.0-kilometer walk according to the installation FACs established procedures. 3.4.5.  There is a minimum 3-minute rest period between components. 3.4.6.  Airmen  must  take  the  FA  at  their  home  station  FAC  unless  written  approval  by  the Unit CC has been given to test at another AF FAC. AFI36-2905  21 OCTOBER 2013   27  3.5.  Body Composition Assessment. 3.5.1.  Height and Weight. 3.5.1.1.  Obtain  height  and  weight  IAW  DoDI  1308.3.    These  measurements  are  not factored into the member’s composite score 3.5.2.  Abdominal Circumference (AC). 3.5.2.1.  The AC measurement is used to obtain the body composition component score.  The use of AC measurement has been authorized by DoD to meet the body composition requirement.  See Attachment 7. 3.6.  Body Composition Assessment Procedures. 3.6.1.  Height Assessment. 3.6.1.1.  Measurement  will  be  taken  in  the  FAC  in  conjunction  with  weight  and  AC measurements.  Where a FAC does not exist, Unit CCs may designate a location for body composition measurements. 3.6.1.2.  Measurement  will  be  taken  with  member  in  Air  Force  PT  t-shirt,  PT  shorts and/or PT pants.  Air Force PT jacket and shoes will not be worn during measurements. 3.6.1.3.  Member  will  stand  on  a  flat  surface  with  the  head  held  horizontal  looking directly  forward,  and  the  chin  parallel  with  the  floor.    The  body  should  be  straight,  but not rigid, similar to the body position when at attention. 3.6.1.4.  Measurement will be recorded to the nearest inch. 3.6.1.4.1.  If the height fraction is less than ½ inch round down to the nearest inch. 3.6.1.4.2.  If the height fraction is ½  inch or greater round up to the nearest inch. 3.6.2.  Weight Assessment. 3.6.2.1.  The  measurement  will  be  made  on  a  scale  calibrated  IAW  TO  33K-1-100-1, Section 3, Technical Manual on Calibration Procedure for Maintenance Data Collection Codes and Calibration Measurement Summaries, and recorded to the nearest pound with the following guidance. 3.6.2.2.  If the weight fraction is less than ½ pound, round down to the nearest pound. 3.6.2.3.  If the weight fraction is ½ pound or greater, round up to the nearest pound. 3.6.2.4.  Two pounds will be subtracted for clothing worn during official FA. 3.6.3.  Abdominal Circumference (AC) Assessment. 3.6.3.1.  FAC staff or trained augmentee will take the AC measurement in a private room or  in  a  partitioned  area.    Individuals  conducting  AC  measurements  will  be  of  the  same gender as the member being taped.  Where a FAC member or a PTL of the same gender is not available, an observer of the same gender must be present. 3.6.3.2.  Tape measure made of non-stretch (fiberglass) material will be used for the AC measurement.   28  AFI36-2905  21 OCTOBER 2013 3.6.3.3.  The tester will start the measurement on the right side of the Airman.  The tester will locate the measurement landmark immediately  above the  right uppermost  hip  bone (superior border of the iliac crest) at the side of the body vertically in line with the right armpit  (midaxillary  line).    If  desired,  the  Airman  may  assist  the  tester  in  locating  the measurement landmark by resting the right hand on the hip, using rearward facing right thumb  to  locate  the  iliac  crest.    The  tester  will  determine  final  horizontal  -  vertical intersection point for landmark confirmation. 3.6.3.4.  The Airman  will stand on a flat  surface  with  feet  no more than shoulder width apart.  The head should be horizontal, looking directly forward with the chin parallel to the floor.  The Airman may use one hand to initially assist the tester in anchoring the tape measure to the body, but must remove the hand from the tape measure before the official measurement is recorded.  Measurement will be taken on bare skin.  The free hand may be  used  to  hold  the  shirt  out  of  the  way,  but  no  part  of  the  hands  or  arms  may  extend above the shoulders. Figure 3.1.  Measuring Tape Position for Abdominal Circumference.  3.6.3.5.  The Airman will remain stationary while the tester conducts the measurement by initially  moving  around  the  Airman  to  place  the  tape  in  a  horizontal  plane  around  the abdomen (Figure  3.1).  The tester will ensure tape is parallel to the floor at the level of the  landmark  (bottom  edge  of  the  tape  just  contacts  landmark),  is  snug,  but  does  not compress the bare skin.  The tester will take the measurement at the end of the Airman’s normal respiration. 3.6.3.6.  The  tester  will  take  the  circumference  measure  three  times  and  record  each measurement rounding down to the nearest ½ inch.  If any of the measures differ by more than  one  inch  from  the  other  two,  the  tester  will  take  an  additional  measurement.    The tester  will  add  the  three  closest  measurements,  divide  by  three,  and  round  down  to  the nearest ½ inch.  The tester will record this value as the AC measurement. 3.6.3.7.  If  an  Airman  tests  on  the  AC  only,  he/she  is  required  to  meet  the  minimum component measurement (39.0 for males and 35.5 for females) to pass the FA. AFI36-2905  21 OCTOBER 2013   29  3.6.3.7.1.  DELETED 3.6.3.7.2.  DELETED 3.6.3.8.  If an Airman fails the abdominal circumference measurement of the FA yet takes and passes the other three components with a score of at least 75 points of the remaining 80 points, the FAC will administer the DoD prescribed Body Mass Index (BMI) screen.  (T-1)    If  the  Airman  passes  the  BMI  screen,  the  Airman  passes  the  body  composition component  of  the  fitness  assessment.    If  the  Airman  does  not  pass  the  BMI  screen,  the Airman will receive a Body Fat Assessment (BFA).  (T-1)  If the Airman passes the BFA, the  Airman  passes  the  body  composition  component  of  the  fitness  assessment.    If  the Airman  fails  the  BFA,  the  Airman  fails  the  body  composition  component  of  the  fitness assessment. 3.6.3.8.1.  If  an  eligible  Airman  passes  either  the  BMI  screen  or  BFA,  the  Airman passes the FA and will be marked “Exempt” in AFFMS for the AC measurement, but all other scores will be recorded as tested.  To properly track these instances, the FAC manager  will  submit  an  exception  to  policy  (ETP)  letter  (refer  to  Attachment  22) within  two  duty  days  to  AFPC/DPSIM  (DPSIM.orgbox@randolph.af.mil)  if  an Airman qualifies to  take and passes  either the  BMI screen or the  BFA.   (T-1).  The AC measurement, BMI score, and BFA (if performed) will be provided in the letter. 3.6.3.8.2.  Airmen  who  take  the  alternate  aerobic  component  (2.0  kilometer  walk-test), or are exempt from any other component, are ineligible to take the BMI screen and BFA. 3.6.4.  Body Mass Index (BMI) Screen 3.6.4.1.  The  tester  will  perform  the  BMI  screen  after  all  other  components  of  the  fitness assessment have been accomplished 3.6.4.2.  The  tester  will  use  the  height  and  weight  mesurements  obtained  earlier  in  the fitness assessment.  To pass the BMI the Airmen, regaurdless of age or gender shall not exceed the maximum BMI of 25 kg/m2.  Refer to the BMI chart at Attachment 13. 3.6.5.  Body Fat Assessment (BFA) 3.6.5.1.  The  BFA  will  be  performed  by  the  FAC  Manager,  FAC  staff,  or  an  alternate.  The  FAC  Manager  must  approve  all  alternates  and  ensure  enough  alternates  are appointed to handle the needs of each specific location. 3.6.5.2.  The  FAC  Manager  approved  tester  will  perform  the  BFA  using  a  2-site  taping (neck  and  waist)  for  males  or  a  3-site  taping  (neck,  waist,  hip)  for  females.    Refer  to Attachment 19 for instructions. 3.6.5.3.  To pass the BFA, a female Airman must achieve a body fat percentage equal to or  lower  than  26%.    A  male  Airman  must  achieve  a  BFA  equal  to  or  lower  than  18%.  Refer to Attachments 20 and 21 for score tables. 3.7.  Aerobic Fitness Assessment. 3.7.1.  The run and walk will be performed on an approved distance course.   30  AFI36-2905  21 OCTOBER 2013 3.7.1.1.  When the run is performed at elevation levels of 5,250 feet and higher, refer to the altitude adjustment chart at Attachment 17. 3.7.2.  Aerobic  fitness  is  measured  with  a  1.5-mile  run  according  to  procedures  outlined  in Attachment 5.  Test administrator will read verbal instructions to those performing 1.5 mile run at A5.5.  All members will complete the 1.5-mile timed run unless medically exempted. 3.7.3.  Members  medically  exempted  from  the  run  and  cleared  for  an  alternate  assessment will, upon recommendation by  the  clinical  provider/FPM/MLO, complete  the 2.0-kilometer walk,  according  to  procedures  in  Attachment  11.    Members  performing  the  2.0-kilometer walk will not be allowed to run (i.e., at least one foot must be in contact with the ground at all  times)  or  the  assessment  will  be  terminated.    Test  administrator  will  read  verbal instructions to those performing 2.0 kilometer walk at A5.6. 3.7.3.1.  The  2.0-kilometer  walk  is  the  only  authorized  alternate  assessment.    NOTE:  Airmen  do  not  select  the  aerobic  assessment  method.    The  clinical  provider/FPM/MLO determines  which  assessment  to  use  based  on  the  member’s  assessment  history  and medical recommendation as documented on the AF Form 469. 3.8.  Muscular Fitness Assessment. 3.8.1.  Muscular  fitness  is  measured  with  a  1-minute  timed  push-up  component  and  a  1-minute  timed  sit-up  component.    Assessment  procedures  and  techniques  are  outlined  in Attachment  5.    FAC  augmentees  will  demonstrate  proper  push-ups  and  sit-ups  prior  to administering the FA unless the instructional  video is  shown.  The FAC is  the authority on standards and procedures; they will address all discrepancies and will provide indisputable on the spot correction. 3.8.2.  Push-Up  Component:    Purpose.  The  push-up  is  used  to  assess  the  member’s  upper body muscular fitness. 3.8.2.1.  Assessment  Duration.    Members  have  1  minute  to  complete  as  many  correct push-ups as possible. 3.8.2.2.  Assessment  Explanation.    The  test  assessor  must  read  the  push-up  script  to  the member  and  demonstrate  proper  technique  (A5.3)  or  may  show  the  Air  Force instructional video.  If the instructional video is shown, script reading and demonstration is at: http://www.afpc.af.mil/affitnessprogram/index.asp. required. found video can be not  This 3.8.2.3.  Starting  Position.    The  member  will  begin  in  the  starting  position  with  hands slightly  wider  than  shoulder  width  apart,  palms  or  fists  on  the  floor  with  arms  fully extended and the body in a straight line from head to heel.  The feet may be no more than 12 inches apart. The member may rest in the up position only.  The member may remove their  hands  or  feet  from  the  floor,  or  bridge  or  bow  their  back,  but  only  in  the  up/rest position.  The body should maintain a rigid form from head to heel.  The feet may not be supported or braced (e.g., no crossing of the feet). 3.8.2.4.  Complete  Push-up.    From  the  starting  position  (elbows  extended),  the  member will  lower  the  body  to  the  ground  until  the  upper  arm  is  at  least  parallel  to  the  floor (elbow  bent  at  least  90  degrees  or  less)  before  pushing  back  up  to  the  starting  position (the chest may touch but not rest on or bounce off the floor).  The member completes one AFI36-2905  21 OCTOBER 2013   31  full  push-up  after  returning  to  the  starting  position  with  elbows  fully  extended.    It  is important  to  monitor  the  member’s  form  and  make  sure  the  body  does  not  bow  at  the waist as the member tires.  The body must remain rigid during the assessment (the back must  remain  straight  unless  resting).    Incorrect  push-ups  (e.g.,  member  does  not  lower body until upper arm is at least parallel to the floor, member does not fully extend elbows when returning to starting position, body bows at the waist, etc.) will not be counted.  If an  incorrect  push-up  is  performed,  assessor  will  repeat  the  number  of  the  last  correct push-up and explain what is being done incorrectly.  Member may rest in the up position only.   If member rests in  the down position with their body on the  ground, the push-up component of the test will be terminated. 3.8.2.5.  Stopwatch.    The  test  assessor  is  responsible  for  operating  the  stopwatch.    The assessor will start the stopwatch when the member(s) is/are instructed to begin, observe the assessment and notify the member how much time is remaining at 30 seconds and 15 seconds.    Prior  to  beginning  the  assessment  the  assessor  will  inform  the  members  to continue to perform push-ups until directed to stop or until the member is no longer able to continue. 3.8.2.6.  Counting/Monitoring.  FAC augmentee or another Airman paired to accomplish muscle fitness components will monitor and count the correct  number  of  push-ups.  (T-1).      When  Airmen  are  paired  off  for  the  assessment,  the  FAC  will  oversee  and  spot-check technique to ensure accurate and safe assessment.  The counter/monitor will count the  number  of  push-ups  out  loud.    (T-1).    If  the  Airman  breaks  correct  form,  the counter/monitor repeats the last correct number (e.g., one, two, three, three, four, etc.), as well as gives instruction on what was done incorrectly (e.g., you are not extending your arms fully, keep your back straight, etc.).  Counter and FAC staff/augmentee will monitor the  Airman  from  a  position  that  allows  observance  of  the  Airman’s  form  and  the  arm angles. 3.8.2.7.  Completion/Recording.    Upon  completion  of  the  assessment,  record  the  total number of correct push-ups. 3.8.3.  Sit-Up  Component  Purpose.    The  sit-up  component  is  used  to  assess  a  member’s muscular fitness. 3.8.3.1.  Assessment  Duration.    The  member  will  have  1  minute  to  complete  as  many correct sit-ups as possible 3.8.3.2.  Assessment  Explanation.    The  test  assessor  will  read  the  sit-up  script  to  the member  (A5.4)  and  demonstrate  proper  technique  or  may  illustrate  using  the  Air  Force instructional video.  If the instructional video is shown, script reading and demonstration is at: http://www.afpc.af.mil/affitnessprogram/index.asp. required. found This not video can be 3.8.3.3.  Starting Position.  The use of a mat is optional.  The member will be instructed to lie face up on the floor/mat.  In the starting position, the member’s feet may extend off the  mat,  but  the  buttocks,  shoulders,  and  head  must  not  extend  beyond  the  mat.    The member’s knees will be bent at a 90 degree angle (throughout the assessment), with the feet  or  heels  in  contact  with  the  floor  at  all  times.    The  member’s  arms will  be  crossed over the chest with the hands/fingers on the shoulders or resting on the upper chest.   32  AFI36-2905  21 OCTOBER 2013 3.8.3.4.  Foot  Hold.  The member’s heels  must remain anchored to  the floor throughout the assessment.  The member may request to have their feet held down with the hands or by putting knees on feet  but  the monitor may not  anchor the member’s legs by  holding onto the calves or stand on the feet during the assessment.  Enough force must be applied to keep the feet/ankles from rising while the sit-ups are being accomplished.  If member requests  a  member  of  the  same  gender  to  hold  their  feet,  they  must  be  granted  that request.  In place of a monitor holding the feet, a bolted non-portable toe-hold bar may be used (where available) to anchor the feet so long as the member’s heels remain in contact with the ground at all times and the bar cannot move. 3.8.3.5.  Complete Sit-up.  A complete sit-up is accomplished when the upper torso of the member is  raised off the floor/mat,  the elbows touch the knees or thighs,  and the upper torso  is  lowered  back  to  the  floor/mat  until  the  shoulder  blades  touch  the  floor/mat.  Elbows  must  touch  the  knees  or  thighs  at  the  top  of  the  sit-up,  and  the  shoulder  blades must touch the floor/mat at the bottom of the sit-up.  Any part of your hands/fingers must remain  in  contact  with  your  shoulders/upper  chest  at  all  times.    Incorrect  sit-ups  (e.g., elbows do not  touch the knees or thighs  at  the top of the sit-up, shoulder blades do not touch  the  floor/mat  at  the  bottom  of  the  sit-  up,  hands/fingers  lift  completely  off  the shoulders/upper  chest,  etc.)    will  not  be  counted.    If  an  incorrect  sit-up  is  performed, assessor will repeat the number of the last correct sit-up and explain what is being done incorrectly.    The  member  may  only  rest  in  the  up  position.    If  the  member  rests  in  the down  position  or  holds  onto  their  knees/legs  while  in  the  up  position,  the  sit-up component of the assessment will be terminated. 3.8.3.6.  Stopwatch.    The  assessor  is  responsible  for  operating  the  stopwatch.    The assessor will start the stopwatch when the member(s) is/are instructed to begin, observe the assessment and notify the member how much time is remaining at 30 seconds and 15 seconds.    Prior  to  beginning  the  assessment  the  assessor  will  inform  the  members  to continue to perform sit-ups until directed to stop or until the member is no longer able to continue. 3.8.3.7.  Counting/Monitoring.    The  FAC  augmentee  or  another  member  paired  to accomplish muscle fitness components will monitor and count the correct number of sit-ups.  When members are paired off  for  the  assessment,  the FAC will oversee and spot-check  technique  to  ensure  accurate  and  safe  assessment.    The  counter  will  count  the number of sit-ups out loud.  If the member breaks correct form, the FAC staff/augmentee repeats  the  last  correct  number  (e.g.,  one,  two,  three,  three,  four,  etc.),  as  well  as  gives instruction on what was done incorrectly (e.g., your shoulder blades are not touching the mat/floor,  keep  your  hands  on  your  shoulders  or  chest,  etc.).    Counter  and  FAC staff/augmentee  will  monitor  the  member  from  a  position  that  allows  observance  to ensure the shoulder blades touch the floor and elbows touch the knees or thighs. 3.8.3.8.  Completion/Recording:  upon  completion  of  the  assessment,  record  the  total number of correct sit-ups. 3.9.  Fitness Categories. 3.9.1.  Excellent.  Composite score ≥ 90 and minimums met. 3.9.2.  Satisfactory.  Composite score of 75 - 89.99 and minimums met. AFI36-2905  21 OCTOBER 2013   33  3.9.3.  Unsatisfactory.  Composite score ≤ 74.9 and/or one or more component minimums not met. 3.9.4.  Exempt.    Airmen  must  be  exempt  in  all  four  components  to  be  entered  exempt  in AFFMS II.  (T-1).  For deployment/extended TDY purposes, Airmen must be categorized as Excellent, Satisfactory, or Unsatisfactory before being updated as exempt in AFFMS II.  (T-1). 3.10.  Determining Composite Fitness Score. 3.10.1.  Age and gender-specific fitness score charts are provided in Attachments 10 and 12. 3.10.1.1.  Airmen  will  be  tested  against  performance  standards  by  gender  reflected  in MilPDS. 3.10.2.  Members will receive a composite score on a 0 to 100 scale based on the following maximum  component  scores:    60  points  for  aerobic,  20  points  for  body  composition,  10 points for push-ups and 10 points for sit-ups. 3.10.3.  Determine the score by the following formula in Figure 3.2: Figure 3.2.  Composite Fitness Score Formula. Composite score = Component: Aerobic Body Composition  Total component points achieved X 100 Total possible points Push-ups  Sit-ups  Possible Points:   60 20  10  10  3.10.4.  Scoring  for  exemptions:    Members  with  an  AF  Form  469  prohibiting  them  from performing one or more components of the FA will have a composite score calculated on the assessed  components.    AC  will  be  performed  on  all  members,  unless  exempted  by  medical provider IAW paragraph 5.2, since there is no risk to the member.  Members must achieve a minimum  of  75  adjusted  points,  based  on  points  available,  and  meet  minimum  component standards in order to receive a Satisfactory rating. 3.10.4.1.  Example:  Airman exempted from push-ups:  If Airman receives 48 points for aerobic fitness, 16 points for AC and 8 points for sit-up component; the total component points achieved = 72.  Possible points from aerobic fitness, AC, and sit-up components = 90 points.  Composite score is: (72/90) x 100 = 80 points.  As long as the Airman meets component minimums, Airman receives a Satisfactory rating. 3.10.4.2.  Example:   Airman exempted from  aerobic fitness:    If Airman  has a 39.5 inch waist and receives 11.7 points for AC, 9.5 points for push-ups and 9.5 points for sit-ups; the total component points achieved = 30.7.  Possible points from AC, push-up and sit-up components  =  40  points.    Composite  score  is:  (30.7/40)  x  100  =  77  points.    However, based  on  minimum  component  score  (because  Airman  did  not  meet  minimum  AC requirement of 39.0 inches), Airman receives an Unsatisfactory rating. 3.10.4.3.  Example:  Airmen testing on AC-only:  Airmen testing on just the AC are only required to meet the minimum component standard in this area to pass the assessment. As such, an AC of ≤39.0 for males and ≤35.5 for females will result in a Satisfactory rating.    34  AFI36-2905  21 OCTOBER 2013 NOTE:  All measurements between the AC target and minimum will yield an overall FA score of 75.0 (e.g., Male: AC of 38.0 – 39.0 = 75.0 points & Female: AC of 34.5 – 35.5 = 75.0 points) 3.10.4.4.  Airmen  on  a  permanent  medical  profile,  documented  appropriately  as  a “permanent component exemption” on an AF Form 469 (only), that achieve a score of 90 or  above  (Excellent)  on  the  remaining  components  (using  calculations  above)  will  be tested annually.  Example:  Airman is permanently exempted from the run but can test on the walk:  If the Airman is female and 35 years of age, passes the walk test, receives 17.6 points  for  AC,  9.5  points  for  push-ups  and  10.0  points  for  sit-ups;  the  total  component points achieved = 37.1.  Total possible points from AC, push-ups and sit-up components = 40 points.  Composite score is: (37.1/40) x 100 = 92.75.  The Airman scored above a 90 (Excellent) and will test annually.  NOTE:  Every 365 days  permanent medical profiles are reviewed by medical to determine if they are still valid. 3.11.  Scheduling. 3.11.1.  Frequency  of  the  FA  will  be  based  on  the  previous  fitness  score  unless  an  earlier assessment is necessary to accommodate a TDY, PME or other training courses, PCS moves, leave  schedules,  or  other  situations  that  would  preclude  member  from  maintaining  fitness currency.    Commanders  may  not  direct  out  of  cycle  official  FAs.    However,  Airmen  may volunteer to take a fitness assessment early at their own discretion. 3.11.1.1.  Excellent.    All  Airmen  will  test  by  the  last  day  of  the  month,  12  calendar months following the previous Excellent test as outlined above.  (T-1).  NOTE:  Airman must have earned an Excellent by completing all four FA components (aerobic: 1.5 mile run; AC measurement; push-ups; and sit-ups) or be on a permanent medical profile and declared  medically  incapable  of  performing  one  or  more  components  of  the  FA  and achieve a composite score of 90 or above on the remaining components  in order to test on a 12-month currency cycle.  (T-1).  See paragraph 3.10.4.4. 3.11.1.2.  Satisfactory.  RegAF,  AFR,  and  NGB  (Title  10/Statutory  Tour)  Airmen  who score  a  Satisfactory  score  on  their  FA  must  complete  an  official  FA  at  a  minimum  of twice per year. RegAF, AFR, and NGB (Title 10/Statutory Tour) Airmen with a current Satisfactory FA will test by the last day of the month, six calendar months following the previous  Satisfactory  test  (e.g.,  if  Airman  tested  on  15  April,  then  Airman  must  retest on/before 31 October of the same year).  (T-1).  ANG Title 32 must complete an official FA at least annually and must be tested by the last day of the month, 12 calendar months following  the  previous  Satisfactory  test,  even  if  the  administered  test  included  one  or more  component  exemptions  (e.g.,  if  an  Airman  tested  on  15  April,  the  Airman  must retest  on/before  30  April  of  the  following  year).    (T-1).    NOTE:    Airmen  who  take  the walk test, and who are not on a  permanent aerobic exemption, are ineligible to take the FA  on  an  annual  basis  and  will  test  by  the  last  day  of  the  month,  six  calendar  months following the previous Satisfactory test. 3.11.1.3.  Unsatisfactory.    RegAF,  AFR,  and  NGB  (Title  10/Statutory    Tour)    Airmen must retest within the 90 days following an Unsatisfactory FA.  (T-1).  Unit Commanders may not mandate Airmen to retest any sooner than the end of the 90-day reconditioning period,  however,  Airmen  may  voluntarily  retest  before  the  end  of  the  90-day reconditioning period.  It is the Airman's responsibility to ensure he/she retests before the AFI36-2905  21 OCTOBER 2013   35  90-day reconditioning period expires as non-currency begins on the 91st day.  NGB Title 32 must retest within 180 days following an Unsatisfactory FA.  Unit Commanders may not  mandate  NGB  Title  32  Airmen  retest  any  sooner  than  the  end  of  the  180-day reconditioning period; however, Airmen may voluntarily retest.  Non-currency for NGB Title 32 begins on the 181st day.  (T-1).  NOTE:  Retesting in the first 42 days (90 days for ANG Title 32) after  an Unsatisfactory  FA is  not  recommended;  recognized medical guidance  recommends  a  minimum  of  42  days  as  the  timeframe  to  recondition  from Unsatisfactory to Satisfactory status in a manner that reduces risk of injury. 3.11.1.3.1.  Airmen  who  want  to  retest  during  the  42-day  period  (90  days  for  ANG Title  32)  immediately  following  an  Unsatisfactory  FA  are  highly  encouraged  to complete an unofficial practice FA (administered by a unit PTL) prior to scheduling their official FA.  If an Airman disregards this recommendation, the FA test score will still count as an official score and be entered in AFFMS II. 3.11.2.  In addition to the mandatory official test, commanders may direct unofficial practice tests administered by trained/certified PTLs.  This will afford Airmen regular opportunities to assess  their  compliance  with  AF  fitness  standards,  minimizing  any  surprise  assessment failures  at  the  time  of  official  assessments.    These  assessment  scores  do  not  require  FAC presence  and  will  not  be  entered  into  AFFMS  II;  however,  they  may  be  used  as  a commander’s tool to  evaluate fitness/readiness.  Tests conducted as unofficial practice tests cannot be counted as official. 3.12.  Currency.  Each  Airman  is  responsible  for  knowing  the  block  of  time  within  which his  or  her  Fitness  Assessment  is  required.    Currency  is  established  upon  completion  of  the following program requirements based on the member’s most recent fitness level as described in paragraph 3.11. 3.12.1.  If  a  FA  has  not  been  scheduled  in  the  period  required  to  remain  current,  notify  the designated FAC representative, UFPM, or superior authority, in writing (includes e-mail) of the  need  to  schedule  the  FA  and  requests  that  it  be  scheduled  immediately  for accomplishment within the required window.  It is ultimately the Airman’s responsibility to ensure their FA is scheduled within their installation’s guidelines. 3.12.2.  Failing to remain current, as well as failing to attain a passing score on the applicable FA before the end of any performance report reporting period, will be considered as part of the  performance  assessment  on  the  Airman’s  evaluation  if,  as  of  the  closeout  date  of  any performance report, currency or a passing score is not obtained.  Enlisted Airmen failing  to have  a  current/passing  FA  score  by  the  SCOD/PECD  will  render  them  ineligible  for promotion  during  that  cycle.    Accordingly,  commanders  should  consider  delaying  the promotion of officers failing to have a current/passing FA at the Projected Date of Promotion (PDOP).  Officers in this fitness status will remain eligible for promotion (See AFI 36-2501, Officer  Promotions  and  Selective  Continuation,  Chapter  5).    Monitor  any  personal  FA exemptions, schedule any necessary medical examinations, and initiate FA test arrangements in  a  timely  manner.    NOTE:    See  Table  A14.1.  and  A14.2.  for  mandatory  and  optional commander actions upon FA failure. 3.12.3.  Waivers.  If an Airman is unable to complete any required portion of the AF Fitness Program  (e.g.,  FA,  intervention  classes),  the  Airman  must  receive  written  approval  (Table 5.1)  from  the  Unit  commander  for  rescheduling.    (T-3).    A  copy  of  the  written  approval  is   36  AFI36-2905  21 OCTOBER 2013 filed  by  the  UFPM  in  the  Airman’s  fitness  program  case  file.    For  ARC  Airmen  unable  to complete  any  scheduled  FA,  the  Airman  must  be  rescheduled  to  test  on  the  next  date  the Airman is in a military duty status and official FAs are being conducted.  (T-1). 3.12.4.  Deployments.    Airmen  must  have  a  current  FA  on  file  prior  to  arrival  at  their deployed  location.    (T-1).    Airmen  will  not  be  considered  Exempt  in  the  deployed  location until their current FA expires.  If an Airman fails before deploying/extended TDY and their evaluation closes out after the deployment starts, this failure will be considered as part of the performance  assessment  on  the  evaluation.    Exempt  will  be  marked  when  the  Airman’s current  FA  expires  in  a  deployed  location  where  they  CANNOT  test  or  choose  not  to volunteer to  test  at  locations  where FA testing is  available.   NOTE:   See Table A14.1. and A14.2. for mandatory and optional commanderactions upon FA failure. 3.12.4.1.  Any failures will be annotated in AFFMS II and will be considered IAW 10.1.  However,  if  an  Airman  reaches  the  91-day  mark  after  the  FA  (failure),  but  before  the evaluation closes out, the Unsatisfactory score is no longer current and the evaluation will be  marked  Exempt.    For  Satisfactory  and  Excellent  scores,  deployed  Airmen  become Exempt  when  they  reach  the  first  day  of  the  month,  seven/thirteen  calendar  months following the previous official FA rating. 3.12.4.2.  Home  station  UFPM  will  notify  the  FAC  to  update  AFFMS  II  placing  the deployed  Airman  in  exempt  status  after  their  “current”  FA  expires.    (T-1).    UFPMs performing FAC duties at GSUs will update exempt status in AFFMS II.  (T-1).  NOTE: The  end  date/duration  of  the  deployment  exemption  should  include  in  the  42-day reconditioning  period  (90  days  for  non-AGR  and  Traditional  ARC)  afforded  to  all Airmen returning from a deployment of greater than 30 days. 3.12.4.3.  Members who are due to take a FA upon return from deployment will be given 42 days for post deployment reconstitution and training from the date they sign into their home  unit.

Installation CCs may request a waiver from MAJCOM/CV or equivalent (NGB/A1 for ANG) to adjust scheduling of the 1.5-mile run or 2.0-kilometer walk assessments for extreme seasonal  weather  conditions  (see  Attachment  6)  if  an  appropriate  indoor  facility  is  not available.    The  waiver  must  specify  periods  unable  to  complete  the  run/walk  assessment safely.    Any  approved  installation  waiver  will  be  extended  to  all  tenant  units  physically located on the installation.  The ARC MAJCOM/CV (or equivalent) that owns the tenant unit also  has  the  authority  to  approve  a  tenant  waiver.    Members  will  still  test  on  remaining components and will be granted an exemption from the aerobic component of the test for the time  period  specified  in  the  approved  waiver.    RegAF,  Title  10  Statutory  Tour  and  ARC AGR  members  will  be  required  to  test  again  in  6-months,  even  if  they  score  90  or  above.

Exemptions are designed to  categorize Airmen as unable  or unavailable to  train or assess for a limited time period. Exemptions, for medical reasons, are entered into AFFMS II using the current AF Form 469 following FA completion. 5.2.  Exemptions.  Commanders  may  grant  exemptions  as  outlined  in  Table  5.1.    Airmen  with exemptions  prohibiting  them  from  performing  one  or  more  components  of  the  FA  will  be assessed  on  the  remaining  components  and  scored  IAW  paragraph  3.10.    FA  exemption recommendations for medical reasons can only be made by a MTF provider or ANG MLO.  All Airmen  will  complete  an  AC  assessment  as  listed  in  paragraph  5.2.7.,  unless  they  have  a Deployment Availability Working Group (DAWG) approved exemption for a condition that the MTF provider/FPM/MLO deems would warrant AC assessment exemption.  (T-1).  Temporary exemptions will not be issued for Airmen still currently assigned to a unit solely for the purpose of improving currency compliance rates (i.e., where Airman is not on terminal leave). 5.2.1.  Airmen with  an approved retirement or separation date within 12 months (365 days) of the last Satisfactory, Excellent, or Exempt FA that is current are Exempt.  If the separation or  retirement  date  is  cancelled,  Airmen  will  complete  the  FA  IAW  their  original  FA  cycle (i.e. 6 or 12 months) or, if the original cycle date has passed, within 42 days (reacclimation time). 5.2.2.

BMT Airmen and Technical Training students will complete official FAs via training cadre  PTLs/MTLs.    (T-1).    The  last  FA  administered  at  BMT  will  count  as  an  Enlisted Airman’s first official FA for AFFMS II input.  Graduated BMT Airmen will hand carry FA AF  Form  4446  for  input  into  AFFMS  II  by  the  FAC  at  their  first  duty  station  or  technical training (MTL/UFPM), whichever location they report to first.  Technical Training students attending follow-on training that may result in an FA cycle testing requirement (six months) will  be  tested  by  a  PTL/MTL.    (T-1).    Airmen/UFPMs  must  be  aware  of  the  42-day acclimatization period and leave en route duration to determine which base will conduct the FA to ensure Airmen remain current. 7.1.3.1.  Enlistees  will  be  given  two  assessment  opportunities  on  baseline  minimum aerobic and body composition standards upon arrival at BMT.  (T-1).  The failure to meet either:  1) aerobic fitness standards of: 1.5 mile run time of 18:30 male, 21:35 female, or 2)  body  composition  standards  of:  maximum  abdominal  circumference  of  39.0  inches male, 35.5 inches female or maximum body fat of 20% male, 28% female, upon arrival at BMT  deems  them  physically  unable  to  safely  rehabilitate  to  a  passing  FA  score  within the  standard  42-day  rehabilitation  period.  Two-time  failures  under  the  standards  in  this   48  AFI36-2905  21 OCTOBER 2013 paragraph may be immediately processed for entry level separation pursuant to AFI 36- 3208,  Administrative  Separation  of  Airmen,  para  5.22.    Note:    ARC  Airmen  who  are awaiting entry into BMT but are participating at their Unit will be exempted from the FA until such a time they are entered into BMT. 7.1.4.  Technical training school students will complete official FAs via unit PTLs/MTLs as required  to  maintain  currency  IAW  Chapter  3.    (T-1).    Results  from  FAs  conducted  at technical training schools (not BMT) will be input by training squadron UFPMs into AFFMS II.    (T-1).    All  permanent  party  training  unit  personnel  (i.e.  cadre,  instructors,  etc.)  will complete FAs via the FAC.  (T-1). 7.2.  Geographically Separated Units (GSUs)/Individuals. 7.2.1.  Members will complete all components of the FA. 7.2.1.1.  Where no FAC exists, UFPM and/or PTL fulfill the roles of the FAC, but must adhere  to  ‘same  unit/PAS  code’  policy  IAW  para  2.28.1.    (T-2).    Prior  to  performing official  FAs  via  unit  PTLs,  GSU  commanders  will  ensure  all  PTLs  have  obtained  a minimum PTL-B certification from the servicing FSS.  (T-1).  Procedures to ensure this directions is adhered to  will be determined by local leadership.  Alternatively, members will work with their unit CC to accomplish the FA at an alternate location where a FAC is available.  Unit TDY funds may be used if necessary. 7.2.1.2.  The host base will provide fitness program support. 7.2.1.3.  For AFRC GSUs, the AFRC FPM and supporting FSS units will provide support to UFPMs and commanders.  HQ AFRC FPM will support UFPMs at DRUs that report directly to AFRC or a Numbered Air Force. 7.2.1.4.  ANG GSUs.  Commanders will provide UFPMs/PTLs to conduct FAs. 7.2.1.5.  In unique  circumstances (e.g., only one AF member at  a location), the unit CC may authorize a non-AF person to conduct FAs.  This individual must be PTL-B certified to conduct the FA.  (T-1).  A commander may coordinate with the nearest AF base FSS to train and certify non-AF personnel to become PTL-B certified.  Results of the FA will be entered in the AFFMS II by FAC personnel at the parent organization. 7.2.1.5.1.  When circumstances prohibit personnel from receiving PTL training  from a  nearby  AF  installation,  then  PTL  FA  training  is  accomplished  via  official  slide video. at http://www.afpc.af.mil/affitnessprogram/videos.asp. found The  video can be 7.3.  Individual Reservists (IR). 7.3.1.  The attached/assigned RegAF unit is responsible for management of the FP for IRs. 7.3.2.  Program  managers  and  Base  Individual  Mobilization  Augmentee  Administrator (BIMAA) will monitor the timely completion of FP requirements with the attached/assigned RegAF  unit  and  the  IR,  and  will  provide  FA  expiration  dates  if  not  accessible  by  the attached/assigned RegAF unit. 7.3.3.  Members will be assessed by the attached/assigned RegAF unit during the member’s AT, if possible, or during an Inactive Duty Training (IDT) period.  Members will contact the RegAF UFPM to schedule the FA. AFI36-2905  21 OCTOBER 2013   49  7.3.3.1.  IRs  who perform  duty  at  a location outside their commuting area may  perform their FA with an AF unit at or near their home, with RegAF commander’s approval.  The Airman’s RegAF UFPM will coordinate a test date/time with the FAC at the AF unit that will be conducting the FA.  (T-1).  The FAC conducting the FA will forward or input the test results into AFFMS II and forward a copy to the owning FAC and UFPM.  (T-1). 7.3.4.  Members must be in a military duty status during assessment IAW paragraph 2.31.8. 7.3.5.  ARC  members  may  not  apply  personal  physical  fitness  activities  for  the  purpose  of obtaining participation credit for AT, UTA, IDT, or additional training periods. 7.3.6.  All  Participating  Individual  Ready  Reserve  (PIRR)  members  in  the  Civil  Air  Patrol United  States  Air  Force  (CAP-USAF)  and  Air  Liaison  Officer  (ALO)  programs  are authorized to perform the FA only once per year. 7.4.  Air Reserve Component (ARC) Tenant Support at Active Duty Installations. 7.4.1.  ARC tenants will utilize host FAC to support official FAs at collocated installations.  FACs must coordinate and provide full operational support for ARC tenant units to conduct FAs on UTA weekends, as well as support other ARC members who are available for testing during the week. 7.4.1.1.  If host FAC cannot provide the appropriate number of FAC augmentees to fully support weekend ARC testing requirements, FAC may request ARC tenant unit provide PTLs to augment FAC and conduct weekend FAs.  If augmentation is required, a ratio of 1 host FAC member to 4 ARC augmentees must be maintained during FAs.  Tenant ARC units  should  provide  testing  schedule/requirements  to  host  FAC  a  minimum  of  60  days prior to UTA weekends.  FAC must request augmentation support a minimum of 45 days prior  to  the  UTA.    NOTE:    When  augmenting  the  FAC,  ARC  PTLs  will  not  test members from their own unit/PAS code. 7.4.1.2.  ARC  tenant  wings  at  RegAF  bases  may  conduct  their  own  fitness  assessments on UTA weekends contingent upon agreement between Host Installation Commander and ARC  Wing  Commander.    If  approved,  testing  will  be  overseen  by  the  Wing  Fitness Program  Manager  (FPM).  Additionally,  FPM  will  ensure  the  ARC  PTLs  do  not  test Airmen  from  their  own  unit/PAS  code  and  do  not  update  FA  scores  in  AFFMS  II  for Airmen from their own unit/PAS code. 7.4.1.3.  All  FAC  augmentees  must  have  a  minimum  PTL-B  certification  and  receive refresher FA procedures training prior to administering any FAs.   50  AFI36-2905  21 OCTOBER 2013 Chapter 8 PROGRAM  MANAGEMENT 8.1.  Fitness Program Software Application. 8.1.1.  The AFFMS II software application is accessible through the AFPC Secure website. 8.1.2.  Specific privileges to enter data, view, retrieve and print reports, conduct audits, and correct data entries are granted by FAC personnel according to roles and responsibilities for FP data management. 8.1.3.  All requests for specific user privileges must be in writing and sent to the designated office of assignment authority as written in the AFFMS II User Guide, and applied using the appropriate user role/privilege descriptions. 8.1.3.1.  AFFMS  II  User  Role  Descriptions.    See  AFFMS  II  User  Guide  available  on AFFMS II homepage. 8.2.  Fitness Program (FP) Case Files. 8.2.1.  The  UFPM  initiates  a  FP  case  file  when  an  Airman  scores  Unsatisfactory  on  a  FA.  The case file will  contain AF Form  108, hard copy official AF Form 4446 with  signatures, and applicable AF  Form 422s, retention  decision MFRs, and AF  Form  469s, as required in paragraph 2.28.5.  (T-1). 8.2.1.1.  Upon achievement of first “Satisfactory/Excellent”, UFPM moves case file from active to inactive status.  UFPM maintains inactive case files until the member achieves a sustained  “Satisfactory/Excellent” the  member separates/retires, whichever comes first. for  24  consecutive  months  or 8.2.2.  The  UFPM  responsible  for  monitoring  attached/assigned  reservists  will  create  and maintain the FP case file. 8.3.  Protected Health Information (PHI). 8.3.1.  FA,  including  run  and  walk  times,  push-ups,  sit-ups,  and  AC  component/composite scores  do  not  meet  the  definition  of  PHI  as  outlined  in  DoD  6025.18R,  DoD  Health Information Privacy Regulation. 8.3.2.  Any  occasion  where  an  Airman  interacts  with  a  PCP  or  medical  technician  for education, intervention, assessment, or treatment related to the FP, the information generated as a result of the interaction is PHI and must be handled IAW DoDI 6025.18R and MTF local procedures. 8.3.2.1.  If  PHI  must  be  shared  with  the  Commander,  an  accounting  of  the  specific information  released  must  occur  as  outlined  in  DoDI  6025.18R  and  in  local  MTF guidance unless the member provides written authorization to disclose the information. AFI36-2905  21 OCTOBER 2013   51  Chapter 9 FITNESS METRICS 9.1.  Reporting Requirements. 9.1.1.  DELETED 9.1.2.  Fitness Assessment Statistics. 9.1.2.1.  UFPM reports the following unit metrics to the Unit Commander each month: 9.1.2.1.1.  FA currency status (i.e., number/percent current, not current, and exempt) 9.1.2.1.2.  FA categories (i.e., number/percent Excellent, Satisfactory, Unsatisfactory, and Exempt) 9.1.2.1.3.  Details  on  individual  members  failing  to  meet  FP  currency  requirements, as applicable. 9.1.2.2.  FSS/CC reports the following wing statistics to wing/CC each month: 9.1.2.2.1.  FA  currency  status  by  unit  (i.e.,  number/percent  current,  not  current,  and exempt). 9.1.2.2.1.1.  FA  categories  by  unit  (i.e.,  number/percent  Excellent,  Satisfactory, Unsatisfactory,  and Exempt).   52  AFI36-2905  21 OCTOBER 2013 Chapter 10 ADMINISTRATIVE AND PERSONNEL ACTIONS 10.1.  Adverse  Personnel  Actions  (for  Unsatisfactory  Fitness  Members).  Members  are expected to be in compliance with Air Force fitness standards at all times.  When members fail to comply  with  those  standards  (receive  an  Unsatisfactory  FA  score),  they  render  themselves potentially  subject  to  adverse  action.    Commanders  should  consult  with  their  servicing  Staff Judge Advocate before taking such action. 10.1.1.  Prohibited Actions: 10.1.1.1.  Commanders  may  not  impose  nonjudicial  punishment  (Article  15,  UCMJ) solely for failing to achieve a Satisfactory fitness score. 10.1.1.2.  Member is not subject to adverse personnel action for inability to take the FA if the member is on a 365-day FA exemption that has been validated by the MTF DAWG. 10.1.1.3.  While  units  may  perform  unofficial  practice  tests  for  diagnostic  purposes,  the chain of command will refrain from taking adverse action based solely on the results of these tests.  The ultimate goal of the fitness program is to motivate members to adopt a lifestyle  of  fitness  through  realization  of  positive  health-benefits  from  regular  exercise and  good  nutrition.    Members  are  more  likely  to  embrace  and  positively  view  unit practice  testing  when  conducted  in  the  spirit  of  camaraderie  rather  than  potential penalization. 10.1.2.  Unit  Commanders  or  equivalent  will  consider  adverse  administrative  action  upon  a member’s  Unsatisfactory  fitness  score  on  an  official  FA  (see  Attachment  14).  For administrative separation criteria, see paragraph 10.1.5. below. 10.1.2.1.  If  adverse  administrative  action  is  not  taken  in  response  to  an  Unsatisfactory fitness score on an official FA, unit CCs will document in the member’s fitness case file as to why no action is being taken.  The lack of such CC documentation does not discount the  testing  failure  as  a  basis  in  support  of  administrative  discharge  action  pursuant  to paragraph 10.1.5. 10.1.3.  As  appropriate,  unit  commanders  will  document  and  take  corrective  action  for members’  unexcused  failures  to  participate  in  the  FP  such  as  failing  to  accomplish  a scheduled  FA,  failing  to  attend  a  scheduled  fitness  appointment,  or  failing  to  complete mandatory  educational  intervention.    (T-1).    Commanders  may  use  administrative  action  to document a member’s failure to maintain currency. 10.1.4.  For  standards  and  requirements  relating  to  performance  report  documentation  of fitness,  consult  AFI  36-2406,  Officer  and  Enlisted  Evaluation  Systems,  and  other  official guidance specifically addressing performance reports. 10.1.5.  Administrative Separation.  (See AFI 36-3208, Administrative Separation of Airmen,  for  active  duty  enlisted  members,  AFI  36-3206,  Administrative  Discharge  Procedures  for Commissioned  Officers,  for  active  duty  officers,  AFI  36-3209,  Separation  and  Retirement Procedures for Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve Members, for all ARC members.) AFI36-2905  21 OCTOBER 2013   53  10.1.5.1.  Unit  Commanders must make a discharge or retention  recommendation to  the separation  authority  (enlisted  Airmen),    show  cause  authority  (officers),  or  appropriate discharge  authority  for  AFR  and  ANG  members  once  an  Airman  receives  four Unsatisfactory  FA  scores  in  a  24-month  period  and  a  military  medical  provider  has reviewed  the  Airman’s  medical  records  to  rule  out  medical  conditions  precluding  the Airman  from  achieving  a  passing  score  (see  Attachment  16  as  template).    If  the separation  authority  (enlisted  Airmen),    show  cause  authority  (officers),  or  appropriate discharge  authority  for  AFR  and  ANG  members  disagrees  with  the  Unit  Commander’s retention  recommendation, discharge action is  initiated pursuant  to applicable discharge instruction. 10.1.5.2.  If an Airman is retained, any subsequent FA failure that re-establishes the basis for discharge (i.e., four failures in 24 months based on most recent failure date) requires the Unit Commander to initiate a medical records review and submit another discharge or retention  recommendation.    Retention  does  not  prevent  previous  failures  from  being included in the most recent 24 month period for FA failure count. 10.1.5.2.1.  Retention  decision  memorandums  will  be  filed  in  member’s  fitness program case file. 10.1.5.3.  The  24-month  period  for  discharge/retention  recommendation  is  calculated from the most recent Unsatisfactory FA and is measured in months, not days, including the  month  of  the  most  recent  failure.    For  example,  if  the  most  recent  failure  is  15  Jun 2012, then count the failures in the previous 23 months plus the month of the most recent failure  (Jun  2012).    In  this  example,  the  inclusive  months  in  which  you  must  count  FA failures  are  Jul  2010  through  Jun  2012.      Four  FA  failures  anytime  in  those  24  months meets  the  criteria  and  would  require  the  Unit  Commander  to  make  a  discharge  or retention  recommendation,  provided  the  member  does  not  have  a  medical  condition  to preclude  him/her  from  achieving  a  passing  score.    A  recommendation  for  discharge  or retention will be made regardless of an Airman’s achieving one or multiple passing FAs in between the four failures. 10.1.5.3.1.  Drill  status  guardsmen  have  a  limited  number  of  duty  days  to  complete their FA and many Airmen may not have the opportunity to test four times within a 24-month  period.   Unit  commanders  must  make  a  discharge  or  retention recommendation to the appropriate discharge authority for an ANG Title 32 Airman receiving  four  unsatisfactory  FA  scores  within  a  36-month  period.    A  military medical  provider  must  have  reviewed  the  Airman’s  medical  record  to  rule  out medical conditions precluding the Airman from achieving a passing score. 10.1.5.4.  Unit  Commanders  may  initiate  (enlisted  Airmen)  or  recommend  (officers) administrative  discharge  only  after  the  Airman  has:    received  four  Unsatisfactory  FA scores  in  a  24-month  period;  failed  to  demonstrate  significant  improvement  (as determined by the commander) despite the reconditioning period; and a military medical provider  has  reviewed  the  Airman’s  medical  records  to  rule  out  medical  conditions precluding the member from achieving a passing score.     54  AFI36-2905  21 OCTOBER 2013 10.2.  Failing to Present a Professional Military Image While in Uniform. 10.2.1.  Commanders  must  ensure  members  present  a  professional  military  image  while  in uniform.    A  professional  military  image/appearance  may  or  may  not  directly  relate  to  an individual’s fitness level or weight. 10.2.2.  Commanders  may  require  individuals  who  do  not  present  a  professional  military   appearance  (regardless  of  overall  FA  composite  score)  to  enter  the  FIP  (SFIP  for  ARC) and/or  otherwise  schedule  individuals  for  fitness  education  and  intervention.    Commanders taking such action: 10.2.2.1.  Specify in writing, using AF Form 108, the date an individual should complete the program and the requirements they must meet. 10.2.2.2.  May extend the exercise program in writing beyond the initial period until the  participant achieves a professional military appearance. 10.2.2.3.  May  take  administrative  and/or  personnel  action  if  the  individual  fails  to participate or comply with the requirements established by the Commander. 10.3.  Education and Training Programs. 10.3.1.  This instruction does not set eligibility standards for attending PME or other training programs.    For  those  standards  consult  the  applicable  governing  regulations.    Personnel selected  to  attend  PME  may  be  required  to  fitness  test  outside  their  normal  cycle  to  meet eligibility  requirements  for  attending  PME.    In  those  situations  where  members  with Unsatisfactory FA scores are permitted to attend training, the following rules apply: 10.3.1.1.  Airmen enrolled in the FIP must continue with this program and scheduled FAs while in training status.  (T-1). 10.3.1.2.  Commanders  sending  members  enrolled  in  the  FIP  to  a  training  TDY  that exceeds  6  weeks  must  send  the  gaining  commander  or  equivalent  a  memorandum explaining  the  required  intervention,  follow-up,  and  testing  (Attachment  8)  at  least  2 weeks prior to TDY. 10.3.1.3.  The gaining commander or commandant at the TDY location will assume unit CC responsibilities for FP purposes. 10.3.1.4.  ARC members in all fitness categories going on active duty orders for training must be prepared to participate in PT programs and those in the SFIP must participate in the FIP during periods of active duty. 10.4.  AF Form 108, Physical Fitness Education and Intervention Processing. 10.4.1.  UFPMs initiate and annotate mandatory FIP option(s) and appointments on AF Form 108 to include date/time and location. 10.4.2.  Member  will  sign  the  AF  Form  108  acknowledging  FIP  enrollment,  accepting responsibility  for  improving  their  fitness  level,  completing  program  requirement  and  if appropriate providing documentation of program compliance. 10.4.3.  Unit  Commander  or  equivalent  will  use  the  AF  Form  108  as  a  tool  to  document mandatory  education  and  intervention  requirements.    The  failure  of  command  or  command representatives to sign, annotate, or otherwise complete the AF Form 108 in no way lessesns AFI36-2905  21 OCTOBER 2013   55  the  member’s  overarching  responsibility  for  his/her  own  fitness  and  compliance  with  AF Fitness standards. 10.4.4.  Respective  program  facilitator  of  the  education/intervention  program  signs  the  AF Form 108 upon completion, when applicable.  Program facilitator signature on AF Form 108 is not required for online FIP.  Annotations can be made on the back of the AF Form 108 for programs requiring multiple attendances. 10.4.5.  Members  with  Unsatisfactory  scores,  or  their  Commanders,  may  request  a  clinical case  review  to  determine  if  there  are  documented  medical  conditions  that  prohibit  program success  (Attachment  16).  This does not  require a face to  face encounter with the member unless determined by the healthcare provider to be clinically indicated.  For purposes of the Fitness Program, obesity will not be used as a diagnosis prohibiting program success. 10.4.6.  If  a  member  fails  to  show  for  any  assigned  appointments,  the  FAC  and/or  Health Promotion/medical staff will notify the member’s UFPM who, in turn, will notify the CC for appropriate action. 10.4.7.  Barnes Center for Enlisted Education Senior Enlisted Leader ad NCOs assigned duty as  Detachment  Chief  or  Academy  Commandant  have  signature  authority  for  the  AF  Form 108. 10.5.  Removing FA Scores from AFFMS II. 10.5.1.  If  an  Airman  believes  the  administration  of  his/her  FA  or  his/her  FA  score  was  in error or unjust, he/she may submit an appeal to the Installation Commander, or equivalent as described in figure 10.1. 10.5.1.1.  At  installations  with  multiple  wings  or  tenant  organizations,  the  Installation Commander may delegate this action to the respective Wing Commander/equivalent.   56  AFI36-2905  21 OCTOBER 2013 Figure 10.1.  Fitness Assessment Appeals Process. Step 1:  Airman notifies UFPM of potential records error  Step 2:  UFPM collects a Memorandum for Record from the Airman that includes:  -Requested Action; applicant must identify what action they request to be taken  -Basis for request; it must be clear what they believe to be an injustice or error  -References or supporting documentation  -Applicant information to include name, organization/office symbol, unit address, contact phone number, email address, and signature  Step 3:  UFPM route through chain of command to Installation Commander/equivalent  Step 4:  If the Installation commander or equivalent approves removal, UFPM/FAC notifies FIM of approved FA removal/correction.  For disapproved requests, the Installation commander or equivalent will provide the Airman with disapproval rationale.  Step 5:  For approval, FIMs will update the Airman’s record  Step 6:  If the Airman wants to appeal the denied request, the UFPM/FAC must submit the complete package to Fitness Assessment Appeals Board (FAAB) at AFPC/DPSIM at afpc.dpsim.fitnessassessmentappeals@us.af.mil.  If needed, the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records (AFBMCR) will be the final decision authority. 10.5.2.  Information  pertaining  to  the  Wing-level  process  and  procedure  and  FAAB supplemental review can be found at: http://www.afpc.af.mil/affitnessprogram/. 10.6.  Correcting  administrative  errors  on  FA  Scores  in  AFFMS  II.  Administrative  errors are limited to:  Number of repetitions performed does not match number submitted in AFFMS II; corrections to profile dates and exemption updates; deletion of score double entry; and FAs taken while  pregnant.    FAC  will  submit  requests  for  administrative  corrections  to  their  installation FIM.    In  cases  where  a  FAC  does  not  exist,  the  administering  PTL,  UFPM,  or  Airman  may submit the request directly to the FIM.  Requests for administrative correction must include the appropriate documentation (i.e., score sheet and/or AF Form 469) for verification purposes. 10.6.1.  DELETED  DARRELL D.

VO2 Max—The maximum volume of oxygen taken in, transported and used by the pulmonary, cardiovascular,  and  muscular  systems  measured  in  milliliters  of  oxygen  per  kilogram  of  body weight per min (ml/kg/min).  VO2 max is the measure of cardiorespiratory endurance or aerobic fitness  and  refers  to  the  ability  to  perform  large  muscle,  dynamic,  moderate-to-high  intensity exercise  for  prolonged  periods.    It  is  important  to  measure  cardiorespiratory  endurance  for: exercise  prescription,  progress,  feedback,  and  motivation  in  an  exercise  program,  as  well  as prediction of medical conditions and further diagnoses of health problems. Wet  Bulb  Globe  Temperature—A  composite  temperature  used  to  estimate  the  effect  of temperature,  humidity,  wind  speed  and  solar  radiation  on  humans.    It  is  used  by  industrial hygienists,  athletes,  and  the  military  to  determine  appropriate  exposure  levels  to  high temperatures.    64  AFI36-2905  21 OCTOBER 2013 Attachment 2 PHYSICAL FITNESS GUIDANCE A2.1.  Physical  Fitness.  Physical  Fitness  is  the  health  and  care  of  the  body  through  physical activity.    The  health-related  components  of  fitness  are:  cardiorespiratory  endurance,  body composition,  muscular  strength,  muscular  endurance,  and  flexibility-mobility-stability.  Each component  is  a  movement-related  trait  or  capacity  that  is  generally  independent  of  the  others.  An underlying  concept  here is  better status  in  each of the constituent  components is  associated with lower risk for development of disease or functional disability.  The skill-related components of fitness are: agility, balance, coordination, power, reaction time, and speed. These components are more genetically dependent than the health-related components and play a role in some AF specialties (occupation-specific). A2.2.  Goal.   The fundamental  goal  of a physical  fitness program  is  to  bring about  a change in personal  health  and  fitness  behavior,  which  includes,  at  a  minimum,  habitual  physical  activity.  This  regular physical  activity should result in  long-term exercise compliance and attainment  of individual fitness goals and objectives. A2.3.  Objective.  The basic objectives of an exercise program are: 1) to gain health benefits and prevent hypokinetic (inactivity) disorders, or 2) seek to attain greater health benefits and higher levels of fitness beyond basic health by engaging in physical activity of more vigorous intensity or of greater volume (longer duration and greater frequency).  Daily physical activity is essential to  improve  health  and  quality  of  life,  and  maintain  functional  capacity.    Health  benefits  are proportional to both the volume and intensity of activity--thus, every increase adds some benefit.  To  meet  either  of  the  above  objectives  one  must  execute  a  balanced  exercise  program.  Recommendations from the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), the American Heart Association  (AHA),  and  the  U.S.  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention  (CDC)  are included in the exercise guidance below. A2.4.  Aerobic  Fitness.    Synonymous  with  cardiorespiratory  endurance,  it  is  the  ability  to perform  large  muscle,  dynamic,  moderate-to-high  intensity  exercise  for  prolonged  periods.  Performance of such exercise depends on the functional state of the respiratory, cardiovascular, and skeletal muscle systems.  More simply defined as the ability to produce energy.  Your level of aerobic fitness determines how long and how hard you can exercise. A2.4.1.  Mode or Type of Activity.  Improvements in aerobic fitness occur when the activity, at  the  proper  frequency,  duration  and  intensity,  involves  a  large  proportion  of  total  muscle mass,  maximizes  use  of  large  muscles,  (e.g.,  muscles  around  the  thigh  and  hip),  involves dynamic, rhythmic muscle contractions, and minimizes static (no movement) contraction and use  of  small  muscles.    Many  modes  of  activity  meet  these  requirements,  to  include  cross-country  (Nordic)  skiing,  running,  cycling,  swimming,  skating,  rowing,  walking,  aerobic dance,  indoor  aerobic  exercise  machines,  and  some  sports  if  they  are  continuous  in  nature (soccer, basketball, court sports). A2.4.2.  Frequency, Duration, and Intensity.  Accomplish moderately intense aerobic activity 30 minutes a day, five days a week  or vigorously intense aerobic activity  20 minutes to  25 minutes  a  day,  3  days  a  week  and  muscle  fitness  exercise  (see  below),  or  an  equivalent combination of moderately and vigorously intense aerobic activity.  For additional and more extensive  health  and  fitness  benefits,  accomplish  moderately  intense  aerobic  activity  300 AFI36-2905  21 OCTOBER 2013   65  minutes  (5  hours)  a  week,  or  accomplish  vigorously  intense  aerobic  activity  150  minutes  a week,  or  an  equivalent  combination  of  moderately  and  vigorously  intense  aerobic  activity. Generally,  the  minimal  levels  of  exercise  volume  and  intensity  above  are  necessary  to maintain  health  and  fitness,  while  the  higher  levels  are  necessary  to  improve  health  and fitness. A2.4.3.  Intensity Determination.  Moderately intense aerobic activity equates to continuous exercise  that  raises  heart  and  respiratory  rates,  initiates  sweating  (varies  with  climate),  and permits  conversation;  vigorously  intense  aerobic  activity  elicits  higher  physiological responses and permits light or broken conversation. A2.4.3.1.  Heart Rate (HR) Calculations.  Exercise intensity may be measured objectively via HR formulas. A2.4.3.1.1.  Maximal  HR  Formula.    Aerobic  activity  corresponding  to  HRs  in  the range of 60% - 90% of age specific estimated maximal HR. A2.4.3.1.2.  HR Range or HR Reserve Formula – steps are: A2.4.3.1.2.1.  Calculate  Maximal  HR.  For  ages  <  40  years  subtract  age  in  years from 220; max HR = 220 – age. For ages ≥ 40 years multiply age in years by 0.7, then  subtract  product  from  208.  Max  HR  =  208  –  0.7age  for  members  age  40 years and above. A2.4.3.1.2.2.  Measure Resting HR for three to four days shortly after waking for a 60 second period, while in the same body position each day.  Take an average of the measures. A2.4.3.1.2.3.  Calculate HR Range.  HR Range = Maximal HR – Resting HR. A2.4.3.1.2.4.  Calculate  minimum,  optimal  (target),  and  do-not-exceed  (safety) exercise HRs: A2.4.3.1.2.4.1.  Minimum exercise HR + (50% HR Range) + Resting HR. A2.4.3.1.2.4.2.  Optimal exercise HR=(75% HR Range) + Resting HR. A2.4.3.1.2.4.3.  Do-not-exceed  exercise  HR  =  (85%  HR  Range)  +  Resting HR. A2.4.3.1.2.5.  For  example,  a  30  year  old  AF  member  with  a  Resting  HR  of  70 beats/min calculates Maximal HR as 220 – 30 = 190 beats/min and HR Range as 190 – 70 = 120.  Applying the equations: A2.4.3.1.2.5.1.  Minimum  exercise  HR  =  50%  (120)  +  70  =    60  +  70  =  130 beats/min A2.4.3.1.2.5.2.  Optimal  exercise  HR  =  75%  (120)  +  70  =      90  +  70  =  160 beats/min A2.4.3.1.2.5.3.  Do-not-exceed  exercise  HR  =  85%  (120)  +  70  =  102  +  70 =172 beats/min A2.4.3.1.2.5.4.  Therefore, this individual should keep exercise HR above 130 beats/min,  but  below  172  beats/min,  targeting  160  beats/min  for  at  least  20   66  AFI36-2905  21 OCTOBER 2013 minutes to 25 minutes 3 days/week.  Unfit individuals should start at the lower end of the HR Range.  As fitness level increases, the resting HR will decrease, therefore  increase  the  intensity  percentage  from  low  (50%)  towards  optimal (75%).    Also,  base  fitness  personnel  can  help  fine  tune  these  calculations taking into account medications, risk of injury, and individual preferences and objectives. A2.4.4.  Rate of Progression.  A physiological conditioning or training effect will occur at the onset  of  an  exercise  program,  especially  for  individuals  with  low  initial  fitness  levels. Adjustments  in  mode,  frequency,  duration  and  intensity  may  be  necessary  to  reach  higher levels  of  health  and  fitness.    Patience  and  perseverance  are  critical  to  maintain  an  active lifestyle and effective exercise program because many will start a physical activity program, but within the first two or three weeks of starting, quit and return to an inactive lifestyle.  One must  maintain  regular  activity  for  at  least  three  or  four  weeks  before  tangible  and  lasting health  improvements,  including  body  fat  loss,  will  occur.    To  help  ensure  that  increases  in frequency,  duration,  and  especially  intensity  of  activity  occur  in  a  gradual  fashion,  the following  stages  of  progression  are  helpful  to  avoid  injury,  illness,  and  potential discouragement. A2.4.4.1.  Initial Stage.  Include low-level aerobic activities and light muscular endurance exercises for minimal muscle soreness or discomfort.  Do not be aggressive in this stage.  Set  individual  goals  which  are  achievable  and  realistic;  include  a  system  of  personal rewards.  Majority of failures occur in this stage – persevere to experience benefits. A2.4.4.2.  Improvement Stage.  Progress more rapidly here at a higher intensity, steadily increase duration to 45 minutes of continuous exercise.  Increase frequency as adaptation to exercise permits. A2.4.4.3.  Maintenance  Stage.    After  six  months  of  regular  activity,  focus    on maintenance.  Review  goals  ensuring  that  long-term  focus  is  on  a  lifestyle  approach  to activity,  remembering  that  considerable  health  benefits  come  from  regular  participation in moderate exercise. AFI36-2905  21 OCTOBER 2013   67  Table A2.1.

Muscular Fitness.  A linked term for muscular strength, the maximum force generated by a  specific  muscle  or  muscle  group,  and  muscular  endurance,  the  ability  of  a  muscle  group  to execute repeated contractions over a period of sufficient time duration to cause muscular fatigue.  A  balanced  physical  activity  program  should  address  the  five  health-related  components  of physical fitness, with primary emphasis on aerobic fitness, but muscular fitness is also important as inclusion of muscular fitness exercise, and provides several benefits (See Table A2.5). Table A2.2.  Benefits of Muscular Fitness Exercise – General Guidance. 1.  Develops muscular strength and endurance to enhance the ability to live a physically independent lifestyle, i.e., improves daily functional living 2.  Increases and maintains fat-free (lean) mass, helping to maintain resting metabolic rate, which is beneficial for preventing fat gain 3.  Increases the strength and integrity of connective tissue 4.   Increases bone mineral density, preventing age-related bone deterioration 5.  Combats chronic low back problems 6.   Improves the ability of the muscles to recover from physical activity 7.  Provides injury protection during deployment, daily work, and sports and recreational activities 8.  Alleviates some common musculoskeletal complaints which result in lost duty time and medical treatment costs 9.  May provide modest gains in cardiorespiratory fitness 10.  May improve mood and self-image A2.6.  Flexibility.  The maximum ability to move a joint freely, without pain, through a range of motion.    Flexibility  tends  to  decrease  with  age,  primarily  due  to  the  decrease  in  activity associated with age.  Although flexibility is not assessed during the AF Fitness Assessment, no single  test  can  be  generalized  to  evaluate  total  body  flexibility,  it  is  important  to  health  and functional living and should be part of a well-balanced physical activity routine. A2.6.1.  Timing  and  Guidance.    Despite  the  popular  perception  that  stretching  prior  to exercise enhances performance and prevents injury, little scientific evidence exists to support   68  AFI36-2905  21 OCTOBER 2013 such long-held beliefs.  Rather, engage in a gradual, activity-specific warm-up that includes the  movement  patterns  of  planned  activity,  e.g.,  if  running  for  the  workout  then  warm-up with brisk walking, jogging, and dynamic movements or drills such as leg swings and knee raises.    To  help  maintain  flexibility  one  should  stretch  after  a  workout  when  muscles, tendons,  ligaments  and  connective  tissue  are  warmer  (above  normal  body  temperature).  Static stretch according to the following ACSM guidance: A2.6.1.1.  Type:  static  stretch,  with  a  major  emphasis  on  the  major  muscle  groups  to include  the  low  back,  hips,  quadriceps  and  hamstrings  (front  and  back  of  thigh),  lower leg.  Do not ballistic (bounce) stretch. A2.6.1.2.  Frequency: two to three days per week. A2.6.1.3.  Duration:  10 to 30 seconds for each stretch. A2.6.1.4.  Intensity:  to a position of mild discomfort, not to point of pain. A2.6.1.5.  Repetitions:  three  to  four  for  each  stretch  (NOTE:  First  increase  body temperature, do not “cold” stretch.  Finally, avoid comparing one’s level of flexibility to others  as  it  varies  widely  across  individuals  due  to  several  factors  that  include  gender, age, activity level, temperature, and extensibility of the muscles and tendons surrounding the joints) A2.6.2.  Warm-up and Cool-down.  Although frequently ignored, these activities before and after  an  exercise  session  are  important.    Warm-up  should  be  conducted  as  above  (activity specific  movements  and  dynamic  drills)  and  always  precede  physical  activity  to  increase body temperature  and blood flow  and to  guard against muscle, tendon and ligament  strains and  tears.    Cool-down,  as  important  as  the  warm-up,  is  a  gradual  reduction  in  activity  to prevent blood pooling, hasten recovery and avoid injury. A2.6.3.  Stability  and  Mobility.    These  are  terms  recently  combined  with  flexibility  in  this final  health-related  component  to  designate  a  broader  term  that  encompasses  the  role  of stability  and  mobility  in  posture,  occupational  functional  movement,  and  daily  functional living.    Stability  deals  with  maintaining  non-movement  functional  positions,  including postural  stability.    Stability  ranges  from  shoulder  to  ankle  with  shoulder,  core  and  hip stability as primary.  Mobility, similar to stability, is stable, controlled, functional movement through an active range of motion in the various planes of motion. A2.7.  General    Workout    Session.    The  salient  phases  of  a  recommended  general    workout session address the above components in the following order: A2.7.1.  Movement Preparatory Phase (Warm-Up).  Body temperature increases via activity specific warm-up such as dynamic activity drills. A2.7.2.  Cardiorespiratory  Endurance  (Aerobic)  Phase.    Aerobic  activity  such  as  cross-country skiing, running, cycling, swimming, skating, rowing, walking, aerobic dance, indoor aerobic exercise machines (e.g., cycle ergometer, elliptical, rower, versa climber, stair), and some sports if they are continuous in nature. A2.7.3.  Muscle  Fitness  Phase.  Resistance  training  such  as  calisthenics,  weight/object training  (e.g.,  machines,  free  weights,  medicine  balls,  kettle  bells,  bands,  cables,  ropes), plyometrics,  and  field  exercises.    Movement  Patterns  –  run,  bend,  twist,  squat,  pull,  push. AFI36-2905  21 OCTOBER 2013   69  Body  Regions  –  core,  lower,  whole  body,  upper.    Stability  and  Mobility/Functional Movement. A2.7.4.  Combined  Activity  Phase.  Combined  aerobic  and  muscular  fitness  actions,  e.g., rotations, or running between muscle fitness stations. A2.7.5.  Skill Phase.  Occupational or sport specific skill development/practice as desired. A2.7.6.  Movement  Transition/Cessation  Phase  (Cool-Down).    Activity  specific  cool-down. Flexibility - static stretching. A2.8.  Body Composition. Relative portion of the body comprised of fat and fat-free tissue. Body weight  and  body  fat  are  related  to  health  status,  but  misconceptions  exist  regarding  body measurements  and  application  of  results.    In  the  prevention  of  fat  gain  and  associated  diseases the focus must go beyond body weight measures to relative body fat, and body fat distribution. A2.8.1.  Weight  and  Height.    Measurements  of  weight  and  weight  relative  to  height  (scale readings, height-weight tables, BMI) do not differentiate between fat and fat-free tissue, and do not account for fat distribution pattern. A2.8.2.  Relative Body Fat and Body Fat Distribution.  The amount of total body tissue that is  fat  and  where  fat  is  deposited  or  carried  on  the  body  is  necessary  to  complete  a  body composition assessment.  This is done via “non-scale” measurements. A2.8.2.1.  Percent  Body  Fat.    Total  body  fat  relative  to  body  mass  is  known  as  percent body  fat.  Average  and  at  risk  levels  are  15%  and  25%  for  males,  23%  and  32%  for females, respectively. A2.8.2.2.  Abdominal  Circumference.  Increased  health  risks  associated  with  overfat  are not  only  related  to  total  body  fat,  but  also  and  more  closely  to  fat  distribution.    Upper body or trunk fat, specifically abdominal fat, presents the greatest health risk; it is highly linked  to  cardiovascular  diseases  and  metabolic  disorders  such  as  type  diabetes.  Reducing  abdominal  girth  or  circumference  is  more  important  than  normalizing  body weight since exercise induced increases in muscle mass can mask reductions in girth, i.e., with proper exercise body weight may stay the same or even increase, but “belt size” will reduce.    Therefore,  as  abdominal  fat  is  an  independent  risk  factor  for  disease,  the evaluation of AC is used.  A high risk of current and future disease exists for males with an AC > 39 inches and for females with an AC > 35.5 inches regardless of age or height. The health risk is moderate for males with an AC > 35 inches and for females with an AC >  31.5  inches.      NOTE:The  above  guidance  are  recommendations  for  a  member  to increase  or  maintain  fitness.    EP/FPMs  will  determine  whether  adjustments  in  mode, intensity, duration, frequency or repetitions are required based on the member’s exercise regimen, characteristics,  and FA scores to  improve fitness.  Members  who are over age 35  years  and  are  sedentary  and  members  who  are  initiating  a  fitness  program  should contact their fitness center or Health Promotion staff/HAWC for assistance in developing an exercise routine.  Members who are over age 35 years and are sedentary should also consider contacting their medical care provider prior to initiating physical activity.  ARC members  can  consult  Health  Promotion  staff/HAWCs  and  fitness  center  trainers  where available.    Members  are  highly  encouraged  to  seek  professional  advice  from  personal fitness trainers, FCs, or Health Promotion staff/HAWCs for assistance in establishing or adjusting their personal fitness program.   70  AFI36-2905  21 OCTOBER 2013 Attachment 3 SAMPLE UNIT PHYSICAL FITNESS PROGRAMS A3.1.  Ability-based training/fitness screening. A3.1.1.  Commanders will use trained PTL-As to establish unit programs that allow members to  participate  at  their  current  fitness  level  and  progress  gradually.  A  safe  conditioning program encourages and supports members training at their own pace. A3.1.1.1.  PTL-As consult the FPM to assist  with development of  ability-based training programs. A3.1.2.  Commanders  opting  to  implement  maximal  exertion  activities  (e.g.  practice  timed assessments), should require personnel to complete a FSQ (Attachment 4). A3.2.  Considerations to be made prior to beginning the unit physical fitness event: A3.2.1.  Safety/environmental conditions. A3.2.2.  Acclimatization:    Airmen  who  have  recently  PCS’d  require  a  42-day  period  of acclimatization to local environmental conditions. A3.2.3.  Fluids/hydration:  must be available during the exercise event/activity. A3.2.4.  Emergencies/injuries:  establish  emergency  procedures  to  include  availability  of  a cell  phone,  emergency  responder  contact  information,  BLS-trained  members,  and  first  aid kit. A3.2.5.  Safety:  reflective  vests,  appointment  of  safety  monitors/cross  guards,  and cones/signs on course as appropriate. A3.2.6.  Unit Physical Fitness Programs must follow guidance as specified in Attachment 2. A3.2.6.1.  Individual  abilities  should  be  considered  so  that  all  members  are  provided  a workout that is within their current fitness status. A3.2.7.  Warm-up  and  cool-down  periods  should  be  accomplished  with  each  unit  physical fitness event. A3.3.  PTL-developed, ability-based Unit Physical Training Programs. A3.3.1.  Ability  runs.  Prior  to  the  unit  exercise  session,  divide  the  unit  into  groups  based upon the members’ running paces. A3.3.1.1.  A  leader  capable  of  maintaining  the  assigned  pace  for  the  group  should  be assigned to each group to monitor for safety/injuries of group members. A3.3.1.2.  For  safety  purposes,  prior the distance/course to be covered and/or the time in which to run and mark the course to alert others of group PT. the  exercise  session,  determine to A3.3.1.3.  As  a  variation,  the  unit  may  run  together  for  a  specified  short  duration  (at  a pace  that  can  be  achieved  by  all  participants)  and  then  divide  into  the  assigned  ability groups for the remainder of the event. AFI36-2905  21 OCTOBER 2013   71  A3.3.1.4.  As  members’  fitness  levels  increase,  they  should  be  placed  in  faster  running groups. A3.3.1.5.  Discourage formation running and cadence calls while running.  Doing so may place  member  at  risk  for  injury  for  the  shortest  and  tallest  individuals  since  cadence calling forces  all to  move at  the speed and stride length  of the caller.  Running is  more efficient when each member can run at his/her own stride frequency and stride length.  If desired, cadence calls should be used for short-distance foot marches only. A3.3.2.  Multi-station  training  courses  (e.g.,  obstacle  courses,  par  courses,  and  circuit training). A3.3.2.1.  Prior  to  using  course,  discuss  safety  and  fitness  concepts  of  course  with  the EP/FPM. A3.3.2.2.  Consider  individual  abilities  by  permitting  members  to  progress  through course at their own speed.  Those members who complete course in faster times should be  encouraged  to  complete  additional  components  of  course  a  second  time  until  all members are through the course at least once. A3.3.2.3.  Multi-station  training  can  be  accomplished  at  base  fitness  facilities  using exercise/fitness  equipment  or  at  a  designated  outdoor  area  performing  activities  of  both cardiovascular and muscular fitness. A3.3.2.3.1.  Coordinate  with  fitness  facilities  in  order  to  conduct  multi-station training sessions at times conducive to unit, as well as, fitness facility. A3.3.2.3.2.  Coordinate  with  EP/FPM  to  obtain    multi-station    training    programs appropriate to the fitness site. A3.3.3.  Fitness facilities/existing fitness programs/classes. A3.3.3.1.  Coordinate  with  fitness  facilities  for  group  PT  exercise  sessions  and  fitness classes. A3.3.3.2.  Individual  members  should  complete  continuous  aerobic  exercise  of  their choice  (e.g.,  treadmill,  rower,  stair-climber,  cross  trainers,  bicycles,  swimming  and spinning classes).  Recommend 25-45 minutes in duration. A3.4.  Prevention of Injury and Illness. A3.4.1.  Safety  must  be  an  overarching  concern  throughout  all  physical  training.    Consider individual safety issues such as medical or physical limitations and level of ability. A3.4.2.  Ensure  a  safe  environment  for  training  IAW  local  guidance  (e.g.,  assessing  traffic patterns,  use  of  headphones  or  other  personal  equipment,  temperature,  availability  of water/first aid, and awareness of emergency procedures). A3.4.2.1.  Physical  conditioning  conducted  in  PT  uniform  (shorts  and  t-shirt)  may  be performed  continuously  up  to  1  hour  in  all  but  “black  flag”  heat  condition  (90  degrees Fahrenheit  and  above).    Recommend  limiting  fitness  activities  during  “black  flag”  heat conditions to indoor activities.   72  AFI36-2905  21 OCTOBER 2013 A3.4.3.  For  cold  weather  limitations  consult  tables  A.4.1  and  A4.2  in  AFPAM  48-151, Thermal Injury.  Note:  ARC unit PT programs are at the discretion of the unit CC based on mission needs and duty time available for training.  AFI36-2905  21 OCTOBER 2013   73  Attachment 4 FITNESS SCREENING QUESTIONNAIRE Figure A4.1.

Verbal  Air  Force Fitness  Assessment Instructions.  Test Administrator will read/state: You are about to complete the Air Force Fitness Assessment.  You are presumed fit to participate based  on  your  completion  of  the  FSQ.    You  may  re-accomplish  the  FSQ  if  medical  concerns have developed since completion, but must do so prior to beginning the FA.  If you experience injury or illness during the FA, you will have the option of being evaluated at the MTF, but your test may still count.  If the medical evaluation validates your illness/injury your Commander may invalidate the test results.  If the test is invalidated, you will be required to retest within 5 days.  At no time will a back-dated AF 469 (fitness exemption) be accepted.  Each component requires minimum  performance.   If for any  reason  you do not  meet  the minimum  requirements  you are expected to complete the remaining components.  Scores for all components are final. A5.2.  Verbal  Body  Composition  Instructions.  The  Test  Administrator  must  read  the following instructions to all Airmen and demonstrate the proper technique, or show the Air Force instructional video.  If the instructional video is shown, instructions reading and demonstration is not required. A5.2.1.  The abdominal circumference is the assessment for body composition.  Please stand facing  forward  with  your  arms  to  your  side  similar  to  attention  position.    I  will  take  the measurement from your right hand side on bare skin only.  Before the measurement you will adjust your clothing so it does not fall over your waist during the measurement.  I will set the end of the tape directly  above  your hip-bone (iliac crest) and ask  you to  hold  it in  place.  I will walk around you to confirm parallel placement of the tape and then I will kneel down to measure  the  AC  at  the  end  of  your  normal  breath  exhalation.    Make  sure  you  do  not  hold your breath. A5.2.2.  I will take your measurement 3 times.  If there is more than 1 inch difference I will take  a  4th  measurement.    I  will  average  the  closest  3  measurements  and  round  the  result down to the nearest ½ inch and that will be your recorded score. A5.3.  Push-Up  Verbal  Instructions.    The  Test  Administrator  must  read  the  following instructions  to  all  Airmen  and  demonstrate  the  proper  technique,  or  show  the  Air  Force instructional video.  If the instructional video is shown, instructions reading and demonstration is not required. A5.3.1.  The push-up is one assessment of muscular fitness.  Place your palms or fists on the floor, hands will be slightly wider than shoulder width apart with your elbows fully extended.  Your  feet  may  be  no  more  than  12  inches  apart  and  should  not  be  supported,  braced  or crossed.    Your  body  should  maintain  a  rigid  head  to  heel  form.    This  is  the  up/starting position. A5.3.2.  Begin by lowering your body to the ground until your upper arms are at least parallel to  the floor (elbows bent at  90 degrees) then return to  the up position (arms  fully extended but not locked).  This is one repetition. A5.3.3.  Your chest may touch, but not rest or bounce on the floor.  If you do not come down parallel to the floor, the push-up will not count.  Resting can only be done in the up position.  You may remove your hands or feet from the floor or bridge or bow your back, but only in   78  AFI36-2905  21 OCTOBER 2013 the up/rest position, resting any other body part on the floor is not allowed.  If resting occurs in  the  down  position,  the  push-up  portion  of  test  will  be  terminated  and  your  score  will  be based on the correct number of push-ups performed up to that point. A5.3.4.  Your  breathing  should  be  as  normal  as  possible.    Make  sure  you  do  not  hold  your breath.    You  have  one  minute  to  perform  as  many  correct  push-ups  as  you  are  able.    Your counter  will  count  the  correct  number  of  push-ups  aloud.    Your  counter  will  not  count incorrect push-ups.  Your counter will tell you what you are doing wrong and will repeat the last number of correct push-ups until you correct the error.  The total number of correct push-ups in one minute is recorded as your score. A5.4.  Sit-up Verbal Instructions.  The Test Administrator must read the following instructions to all Airmen and demonstrate the proper technique, or show the Air Force instructional video.  If the instructional video is shown, instructions reading and demonstration is not required. A5.4.1.  Begin by laying face up on the floor or mat.  Your feet may extend off the floor or mat,  but  your  buttocks,  shoulders,  and  head  must  not  extend  beyond  the  mat.    Bend  your knees at 90 degrees, with your feet or heels in contact with the floor at all times.  Cross your arms  over  your  chest  with  your  open  hands  or  fingers  at  your  shoulders  or  resting  on  your upper  chest.    This  is  the  starting  position.    When  conducting  sit-ups,  any  part  of  the hands/fingers remain in contact with the shoulders or upper chest at all times. A5.4.2.  If  a  bolted  non-portable  toe  hold  bar  is  used:  Anchor  your  feet  to  the  ground  by hooking your feet/toes under the bar.  Your heels must remain in contact with the ground at all  times  and  the  bar  cannot  move  while  you  perform  the  assessment.    If  a  toe  hold  bar  is NOT used:  Members may request the assessor to hold feet with his/her hands or by putting his/her knees on the feet.  The assessor may not anchor member by holding behind the calves or  by  standing  on  the  feet  during  the  assessment  as  he/she  could  lose  balance  and  step  off.  The member may request a member of the same gender to hold the feet and that request must be granted.  Let your monitor know if you need your feet held differently prior to beginning the assessment. (e.g., "You are holding my ankles/feet too tight or not enough.”). A5.4.3.  From the starting position, raise your upper torso until your elbows touch your knees or thighs.  Then, lower your upper torso until your shoulder blades contact the floor.  This is one  repetition.    Your  elbows  must  touch  your  knees  or  thighs  at  the  top  of  the  sit-up,  and your shoulder blades must contact the floor or mat at the bottom of the sit-up (keeping any part of your hands/fingers in contact with your shoulder/upper chest at all times). A5.4.4.  The repetition will not count if your hands/fingers come completely away from the chest/shoulder or if your buttocks or heels leave the ground.  Additionally, you may not grab onto  your  shirt  as  it  makes  it  difficult  to  determine  if  you  are  maintaining  proper  contact.  Any  resting must be done in  the up position.  While resting  you may not use knees or  any object  to  support  yourself.    If  there  is  any  resting  other  than  in  the  up  position,  the  sit-up portion of the test is terminated and your score will be based on the correct number of sit-ups performed up to that point. A5.4.5.  You  have  one  minute  to  perform  as  many  correct  sit-ups  as  you  are  able.    Your counter will count the correct number of sit-ups aloud.  Your counter will not count incorrect sit-ups.  Your counter will tell you what you are doing wrong and will repeat the last number AFI36-2905  21 OCTOBER 2013   79  of  correct  sit-ups  until  you  correct  the  error.    The  total  number  of  correct  sit-ups  in  one minute is recorded as your score. A5.5.  1.5  mile  timed  run  Verbal  Instructions:  The  Test  Administrator  must  read  the following instructions to all Airmen and demonstrate the proper technique, or show the Air Force instructional video.  If the instructional video is shown, instructions reading and demonstration is not required. A5.5.1.  This  1.5  mile  timed  run  is  used  to  measure  cardio-respiratory  fitness.    Prior  to beginning the 1.5 mile run, you may complete up to a 3 minute warm up.  You will line up behind the starting line and will be instructed to begin running as I start the stopwatch.  No physical assistance from anyone or anything is permitted.  Pacing is permitted if there is no physical  contact  and  is  not  a  hindrance  to  other  runners.    You  are  required  to  stay  on  and complete  the  entire  marked  course.    Leaving  the  course  is  disqualifying  and  terminates  the test.    Your  completion  time  will  be  recorded  when  you  cross  the  finish  line  and  you  are required to complete a cool down for approximately 5 minutes.  If at any time you are feeling in poor health, you are to stop running immediately and you will be given assistance. A5.6.  2.0  kilometer  walk  Verbal  Instructions:  The  Test  Administrator  must  read  the following instructions to all Airmen and demonstrate the proper technique, or show the Air Force instructional video.  If the instructional video is shown, instructions reading and demonstration is not required. A5.6.1.  The  Test  Administrator  must  read  the  following  instructions  to  all  Airmen  and demonstrate  the  proper  technique,  or  show  the  Air  Force  instructional  video.    If  the instructional  video  is  shown,  instructions  reading  and  demonstration  is  not  required.    This test  measures  cardio-respiratory  fitness.    Prior  to  beginning  the  2.0  km  walk,  you  may complete up to a 3 minute warm up.  You will be directed to line up behind the starting line and instructed to begin walking as I start the stopwatch.  You are to walk the 2.0 km course as quickly as you can.  You must not run, keeping at least one foot in contact with the ground at  all  times.    No  physical  assistance  from  anyone  or  anything  is  permitted.    Pacing  is permitted if there is no physical contact and is not a hindrance to others.  You are required to stay  on  and  complete  the  entire  marked  course.    Leaving  the  course  is  disqualifying  and terminates  the  test.    Your  completion  time  will  be  recorded  when  you  cross  the  finish  line and  you are required to  complete a cool  down for approximately 5 minutes.   If at  any time you are feeling in poor health, you are to stop immediately and you will be given assistance.    80  AFI36-2905  21 OCTOBER 2013 Attachment 6 1.5-MILE RUN AND 2.0-KILOMETER WALK COURSE REQUIREMENTS A6.1.

This  attachment  lists  medications  that  may  preclude  aerobic  components  in  the FA.  Before  considering  medications  for  a  medical  exemption,  the  underlying  condition  should be  addressed  as  a  potential  reason  for  exemption.    Chronic  conditions  that  result  in  medical exemption from any aerobic components should be reviewed for possible MEB IAW AFI 48-123 and AFI 10-203. A9.2.  Any  medication  that  affects  the  heart  rate  or  the  heart’s  response  to  exercise  may invalidate  aerobic  components  of  the  FA.  Chronic  medications  should  not  be  discontinued simply  to  allow  the  fitness  assessment  if  this  would  adversely  impact  the  member’s  health  or safety.  Over-the-counter (OTC) medications or “supplements” of any kind should not be a cause for  exemption  unless  the  OTC  medications/supplements  are  specifically  recommended  by  a provider and this recommendation is documented in the medical record.  Members using acute, short-term  medications  that  result  in  component  exemptions  should  be  given  a  temporary duty/fitness restriction until the medication is no longer needed. A9.3.  Table A9.1 is not an all-inclusive list of all medications  that could potentially affect FA  participation.  Furthermore,  individual  patient  situations  may  require  exemptions  beyond what is detailed here.  The member’s provider shall not be constrained by this Table in making fitness  participation  restriction  recommendations.    The  MTF  provider  will  review  the  medical documentation and provider restriction recommendations when making fitness testing exemption recommendations. Table A9.1.

The  following  criteria  must  be  considered  prior  to  the  2.0-kilometer  timed walk assessment. A11.1.1.  Members  completing  the  assessment  must  wear  the  Air  Force  physical  training uniform. A11.1.2.  Members must warm-up prior to beginning the assessment. A11.1.3.  Members must complete the FSQ. A11.1.4.  Course safety/environmental conditions as described in  Attachment  6 (paragraph A6.2). A11.2.  Requirements. A11.2.1.  A  measured  2.0-kilometer,  uninterrupted  course  approved  by  the  Wing  CC.    The course will meet requirements of paragraph A6.1., with the exception of the number of laps. A11.2.2.  Sufficient trained personnel  must be present  to  be able to  monitor members at  all times, to record laps if necessary, and to record walk completion times. A11.2.3.  Additional  equipment  requirements  include  timers,  notepads,  scorecards,  and  pens/pencils. A11.3.  Administering the 2.0-kilometer walk assessment. A11.3.1.  Airmen performing the 2.0-kilometer (2,000 meters) walk  are required to  walk  as quickly as possible.  Airmen must walk but not run, keeping at least one foot in contact with the ground at all times. A11.4.  Scoring results of the 2.0-kilometer walk assessment. A11.4.1.  The walk test is a pass or fail assessment.  No points are awarded for successful completion.  If an Airman passes the 2.0 km walk test, the Airman will have a composite score calculated on the assessed components in the same way the score would be calculated if the Airman were exempt from the aerobic component.

Unit commanders exercise discretion when selecting OPTIONAL command action(s) keeping in consideration the need for progressive discipline and the requirement for a separation package to be processed after the 4th failure in 24 months (or 36 months, when applicable IAW 10.1.5.3.1.).  Commanders may use more than one action per failure.  Recommend commanders consult with their local Staff Judge Advocate (SJA).    Refer to the  governing instructions to determine the correct form and procedures for each action.  NOTES:1.  Commanders may render an Airman ineligible for reenlistment rather than denying reenlistment by specifying ineligibility versus non-selection on the AF Form 418, Selective Reenlistment Program Consideration.   This allows the flexibility of authorizing Airmen to extend their reenlistment for either 4 or 7 months (7 or 12 for ARC) to  improve their fitness level.  Airmen non-selected for reenlistment are not allowed to  extend for any reason and will separate on the date of separation (DOS).    Commanders  may complete a second AF Form 418 changing the Airman’s ineligibility or non-selection status at any time.  2.  For ARC, the use of this option should be weighed against use of administrative  separation and is applicable where recall of this member would not jeopardize mission  readiness.  3.  If an Airman has a history of FA failures, then passes, only to fail again – commanders should consider a more aggressive approach for OPTIONAL actions.  AFI36-2905  21 OCTOBER 2013   101  Attachment 15 SAMPLE MEMORANDUM FOR MEDICAL VALIDATION OF FITNESS ASSESSMENT ILLNESS/INJURY A15.1.

Instructions (Male). NECK: ABDOMEN: BODY FAT PERCENTAGE DETERMINATION: With   the   member   looking   straight   ahead   and   shoulders  down   (not hunched), measure the neck circumference at a point just below the larynx (Adams Apple).  Because of the shape of the neck, the tape will usually be angled down slightly toward the front similar to the shirt collar line.  This angle will vary depending on where the  larynx is located.   Round  the neck measurement up to the nearest quarter inch. With the member standing with arms at his sides and at the end of a normal relaxed  exhalation,  measure  the  abdominal circumference  at  the  navel while  keeping  the  tape  level (horizontal)  to  the  floor.   Ensure  the  tape measure  is horizontal  all  the  way  around  the  abdomen.    Round  the abdomen measurement down to the nearest quarter inch. Determine the individual’s body fat percentage by:  Subtracting the neck measurement from the abdominal   measurement to determine the circumference value.   Use  the  Body  Fat  Percent Tables for Men at Attachment 20 and compare this value to the individual’s height measurement. AFI36-2905  21 OCTOBER 2013   107  Figure A19.1.

NECK: WAIST: BUTTOCKS: With the member looking straight ahead and shoulders down (not hunched), measure the neck circumference at a point just below the larynx. Because of the shape of the neck, the tape will usually be angled down slightly toward the front similar to the shirt  collar  line.  This  a n g l e   will vary  depending  on  where  the  larynx  is  located. Round the neck measurement up to the nearest quarter inch. With the member standing with arms at her sides and at the end of a normal relaxed exhalation,  measure  the  natural  waist  circumference.      The  natural  waist  circumference  is  the narrowest point, usually located about half way between the navel and the lower end of the sternum (breastbone).  Ensure the tape measure is horizontal all the way around the  waist.  When it is not easy to distinguish the narrowest point, take  several  measurements  and  use  the  smallest  measurement.   Round  the  waist measurement down to the nearest quarter inch. While facing the member’s right side, and with the tape measure level (horizontal) to the floor, measure the buttocks circumference by placing the tape (ensure the tape measure is horizontal all the way around) so it passes over the buttocks at the point that protrudes the farthest. EXCEPTION:  Ensure no part of the leg or thigh is a part of the measurement. If so, raise the tape measure up (still keeping it horizontal) to the point in which no part of the leg or thigh is a part of the measurement.  Round the buttock measurement down to the nearest quarter inch. BODY FAT PERCENTAGE DETERMINA- TION: Determine the individual’s body fat percentage by:   Adding the waist and buttocks measurements then subtracting the neck measurement from the sum to determine the circumference value.  Use the Body Fat Percent Tables for Women and compare this value to the individual’s height measurement.  Refer to Attachment 20. AFI36-2905  21 OCTOBER 2013   113  Figure A19.6.
