This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive education and training document   that identifies life-cycle education/training requirements, training support resources and minimum core task  requirements for this specialty.  The CFETP will provide personnel a clear career path to success and instill rigor  in all aspects of career field training. 2.  The CFETP consists of two parts; both of which are used by management to plan, manage, and control training within the career field. 2.1.  Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty.  Section A explains how everyone will use the plan; Section B identifies career progression information, duties and responsibilities,  training strategies, and career field path; Section C associates each level with specialty qualifications  (knowledge, education, training, and other); Section D indicates resource constraints.  Some examples are funds,  manpower, equipment, and facilities.  Note:  The Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory (AFECD) and AFI  36-2101 Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted) contain the specialty descriptions. 2.2.  Part II includes the following: Section A identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS) and includes  duties, tasks, technical references to support training, Air Education and Training Command (AETC) conducted  training, and correspondence course requirements.  Section B contains the course objective list and training  standards supervisors will use to determine if Airmen satisfy training requirements.  Section C identifies a v a i l a b l e  training support materials.  Section D identifies a training course index that is used to determine  resources available to support training. Included here are both mandatory and optional courses.  Sections E and F  identify MAJCOM unique training requirements. 2.3.  Attachment 3 to the electronic version of the CFETP is a career path chart.  This chart provides a visual depiction of the Special Missions Aviation AFSC, Career Enlisted Flyers Incentive Pay gates and years of  aviation service, and key information to education, training and qualification.  It also contains promotion  information specific to the Special Missions Aviation AFSC, such as average time in grade, time in service, as  well as Air Force averages. This chart provides a timeline for achieving additional qualifications such as instructor, evaluator, flying training unit (FTU) assignment, and leadership opportunities within the squadron, group, wing  MAJCOM and HQ/USAF 3.  This CFETP is designed to ensure individuals in AFSC 1A9XX receive comprehensive and effective training at  the appropriate phases of their career.  At unit level, supervisors and trainers use Part II to identify, plan, and  conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan.    4 1A9X1 CFETP 19 January 2016   ABBREVIATIONS/TERMS EXPLAINED Air Force Career Field Manager (AFCFM).

Section A - General Information 1.  Purpose. 1.1.  This CFETP provides information necessary for the Air Force Career Field Manager (AFCFM), MAJCOM functional managers (MFMs), commanders, training managers, supervisors, and trainers to plan, develop, manage,  and conduct an effective and efficient career field training program.  The plan outlines the training that individuals  must receive in order to develop and progress throughout their career.  For the purpose of this plan, training is  divided into four areas:  initial skills, upgrade training (UGT), qualification training (QT), and continuation training  (CT).  Initial skills training is the Air Force Specialty specific training an individual receives upon entry into the Air  Force or upon retraining into this specialty for award of the 3-skill level.  Upgrade training identifies the mandatory  courses, task qualification requirements, and correspondence course completion required for award of the 3-, 5-, 7-,  and 9- skill levels.  Qualification training is actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an airman  in a specific duty position.  This training program occurs both during and after the upgrade training process.  It is  designed to provide the performance skills/knowledge training required for the job.  Continuation training is  additional training either in-residence or exportable advanced training courses, or on-the-job training, provided to  personnel to increase their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required.  The CFETP has several purposes,  some are: 1.2.  Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field training program. 1.3. and phase of an individual’s career in this AFS. 1.4.  Lists training courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of training, and the training medium. 1.5. 2.  Uses. 2.1.  The plan will be used by MFMs and supervisors at all levels to ensure comprehensive and cohesive training programs are available and/or instituted for each individual in the specialty. 2.2.  AETC  training  personnel  will  develop  and  revise  formal  resident,  non-resident,  field  and  exportable  training based on requirements established by the user and documented in Part II of the CFETP.  They will also work with  the AFCFM to develop acquisition strategies for obtaining resources needed to provide the identified training. 2.3.  MFMs will ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial and upgrade skills requirements.  OJT, resident training, contract training, or exportable courses can satisfy identified requirements. MAJCOM-developed training to support this AFSC must be identified for inclusion in this plan and must not  duplicate available training resources. 2.4.  Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan.  The list of courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training. 2.5.  Personnel in AFSCs 1AXXX or 1U0X1 are exempt from maintaining OJT Training Folders (AF Form 623).  All training is certified via AF Form 8 Certificate of Aircrew Qualification by trained flight examiners.  Certification of the Form 8 eliminates the  requirement to document STS items in this CFETP. 3.  Coordination and Approval. The AFCFM is the approval authority.  MAJCOM functional managers and AETC training managers will identify  and coordinate on the career field training requirements.  The AFCFM will initiate an annual review of this  document and coordinate with AETC and MFMs to ensure currency and accuracy. Using the list of courses in Part  II, they will eliminate duplicate training.

Training Decisions The  CFETP  uses  a  building  block  approach  (simple  to  complex)  to  encompass  the  entire  spectrum  of  training requirements for the Special Missions Aviation specialty. This CFETP was developed to include life-cycle (day one through retirement) training requirements for this specialty. The spectrum includes a strategy for when, where, and how to meet the training requirements. The strategy must be apparent and affordable to reduce duplication of  training and eliminate a disjointed approach to training. 6.1. Initial Skills Training. Initial physiological training will be conducted at the Aircrew Fundamentals Course. Significant  changes  were  made  in  initial  skills  training.  A  Course  Training  Standard  (CTS)  was  created  to  align common core training amongst all 1A/1U AFSCs into the Aircrew Fundamentals Course.  6.2. additional training and annotated on member’s AF Form 8 on member’s first assigned weapons system.   6.3. Seven Level Upgrade Training. Must complete all 3- and 5-skill level training requirements.  No formal 7-level upgrade training exists.
