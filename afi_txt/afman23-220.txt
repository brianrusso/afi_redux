Statutory Authority.1.1.1.  Statutory authority governing the accounting for government property lost, damaged, ordestroyed and the fixing of responsibility and liability through the Report of Survey (ROS)  system isfound in various United States Statutes.  This authority includes but is not limited to:• Title 10,  United States Code (U.S.C.), Sections 2775, 9832, and 9835.• Title 32, U.S.C. Section 710.• Title 37, U.S.C. Section 1007(e).1.1.2.  Statutes pertaining to the collection of administratively established debts, such as liability forthe loss, damage, or destruction of government property, include, but are not limited to:• Title 5, U.S.C.   Section 5514.• Title 10, U.S.C. Section 2775.• Title 31, U.S.C. Section 3716.• Title 37, U.S.C. Section 1007(c) through (e).1.2.  Basic DoD Publications.   This manual prescribes the guidance, principles, standards, and proce-dures applicable to cases where Air Force property is lost, damaged, or destroyed.  It is based on the fol-lowing Department of Defense (DoD) publications:1.2.1.  DoD Directive (DoDD) 7200.11, Liability for Government Property Lost, Damaged, orDestroyed, October 26, 1993.1.2.2.  DoD Regulation (DoDR) 7000.14-R, DoD Financial Management Regulation, Volume 12,Chapter 7 (to be published).1.3.  Applicability.   This manual applies to all Air Force activities including the Air National Guard(ANG) and Air Force Reserve (AFRES).  This manual does not apply to nonappropriated fund (NAF)activities except in specified situations.1.4.  Overall Guidance.1.4.1.  Commanders are responsible for government real and personal property under their control.1.4.2.  Air Force, AFRES, and ANG, personnel (including civilian employees, Air Force Reservetechnicians, and ANG technicians) are responsible for the proper care and safekeeping of Air Forceproperty regardless of whether or not it is on property records.1.4.3.  Air Force members and employees can be held financially liable for the loss, damage, ordestruction of Air Force property proximately caused by their negligence, willful  misconduct, ordeliberate unauthorized use.8AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 19961.4.4.  Financial liability against an individual(s) will be assessed only after an official investigationhas been conducted specifically for the purpose of determining the facts and the circumstances relatedto the loss, damage, or destruction of the property.1.5.  Assessing Financial Liability.1.5.1.  Paragraph 4 of the DoDD cited in paragraph 1.2.1. states that financial liability shall beassessed be as follows:“a.  Personal Arms or Equipment.  The full amount of the loss or damage to personal as or equipment.“b.  Items of Military Supply.  The full amount of damage to, or the value of, lost or damaged items of military supply.“c.  Government Housing.  The full amount of loss or damage to Government housing, equip-ment and furnishings therein, if the loss, damage, or destruction was proximately caused by gross negli-gence or abuse by the military member, dependent, or guest.“d.  Other.   In all other cases, up to the full amount of the loss, damage, or destruction of Government property or housing, but in no case more than I month's regular military compensation asdefined in 37 U.S.C. 101(25) in the case of military members and one-twelfth of annual pay in the case ofcivilian employees.  For Reserve component personnel, one month's regular military compensation refersto the amount that would be received by the Service member if on active duty.”1.6.  Attachments.   This manual has six attachments:1.6.1.  Attachment 2 through Attachment 5  are sample memoranda.  They may be "tailored" to fitthe case being processed.  They are written for people who still are working for the Air Force, there-fore, they may require changing if sent to people who have been separated and the Air Force is stillattempting to be reimbursed.  This is especially true if the address of the person may have changed.The ROS program manager must decide what changes should be made in these sample memoranda.1.6.2.  A reasonable effort shall be made to obtain payment from a separated member; however, if cor-respondence is returned by the post office indicating that it cannot locate the addressee, the approvingauthority may close the case and forward it to the Financial Services Officer (FSO) for continuation ofthe collection effort.  This should be accomplished on or before 90 days of the notification notice (seeparagraph 16.2.11.).1.6.3.  When the ROS case is closed, the ROS program manager must have the original copy of theROS in the program manager's file.  If there is any possibility that the original copy will not bereturned, the program manager will send a copy of the original ROS.  This does not apply to routingthe ROS to personnel involved in the investigation, review, approval, or appeals process.AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 19969Chapter 2  GENERAL2.1.  The Air Force Report of Survey (ROS) Program.   The program is based on the DoD referencescited in paragraph 1.2.  The term ROS is used interchangeably throughout this manual in referring to theROS program, procedures for processing a ROS, or the processing of a DD Form 200, Financial Liabil-ity Investigation of Property Loss.2.2.  Purpose.   The purpose of the ROS program is contained in paragraphs 070101 and 070202, DoDR7000.14-R.  See paragraph 1.2.2.  The general purposes are:  2.2.1.  Research and investigate the cause of loss, damage, or destruction of property and determine ifit was attributable to an individual's negligence or abuse.2.2.2.  Assess monetary liability against individuals who have lost, damaged, or destroyed Govern-ment property or relieve them from liability if there is no evidence of negligence, willful misconduct,or deliberate unauthorized use of the property.2.2.3.  Provide documentation which can be used to support the adjustment of accountable records.2.2.4.  Provide commanders with case histories which will enable them to take corrective action toprevent recurrence of the incident.2.3.  Miscellaneous ROS Guidance and Procedures.2.3.1.  Disciplinary Action.  Assessment of financial liability will not be used instead of, or as aform of disciplinary action.  Commanders must decide if a case warrants taking disciplinary actionunder the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ).  This is a separate action and is not related to theassessment or non-assessment of financial liability.  Also, commanders are encouraged to use admin-istrative actions when assessment of financial liability by ROS is not practical or desirable. Thesemeasures could include counseling, oral or written reprimands, appropriate remarks in performanceevaluations, service to the installation or the community, or possibly non-judicial punishment underArticle 15 of the UCMJ.2.3.2.  Jointly Operated Activities.  If an installation or activity is operated jointly by the Air Force andArmy or Navy, the Service component possessing the lost or damaged property is responsible for pro-cessing a ROS according to its manuals, regardless of which Service commands the installation.2.3.3.  Administration of Oaths.  Any Air Force officer appointed to survey property, or the recorderor presiding officer of any board appointed for such purpose, has the same authority to administeroaths or take depositions as officers authorized to do so by the Manual for Courts-Martial (1994 Edi-tion), Appendix 2, Article 136 (Authority to Administer oaths and to act as notary).2.3.4.  Communication Security Equipment and Supply Items.  ROS initiating officials are responsiblefor notifying the local COMSEC custodian when ROS involves the loss of COMSEC equipment andsupply items.10AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 19962.3.5.  Penalizing Units Whose Members Abuse Property.  When circumstances warrant, commandersshould consider withdrawing funds from abusing units and transferring them to units that have torepair the items.  An example of this might be repair of damaged vehicles.2.3.6.  Members' Liability.  All Air Force members and employees can be held liable for the loss, dam-age, or destruction of government property proximately caused by their negligence, willful miscon-duct, or deliberate unauthorized use.  Liability is based upon the preponderance of the evidence. Thatis, financial liability cannot be assessed unless, after considering all relevant factors, it appears morelikely than not that an individual's actions, or failure to act, constituted negligence, willful miscon-duct, or deliberate unauthorized use, and proximately caused the loss, damage, or destruction at issue.If the weight of the evidence does not support either side, an individual is not held liable.  Except forcertain instances described in the following paragraphs, liability is limited to one month's basic pay ineffect at the time the loss or damage occurred.  THIS PARAGRAPH DOES NOT APPLY TO THELOSS, DAMAGE OR, DESTRUCTION OF VEHICLES.  SEE Chapter 18 FOR GUIDANCEAND PROCEDURES PERTAINING TO VEHICLES.2.3.7.  ROS for ANG/AGR Personnel.  Chapter 22 contains procedures for ANG/AGR personnelwho lose, damage, or destroy ANG property.  ROS involving ANG/AGR personnel are processed asif they were regular Air Force members.  ANG/AGR personnel who are found to be pecuniary liablemay be assessed liability up to one months basic pay, regardless of the actual pay received by themember during a particular month.2.3.8.  Interest, Penalty, and Administrative Charges.  Applicable ROS statutes and DoD implement-ing policy explicitly fixed the charges that apply to ROS debts. Therefore, interest, penalty, andadministrative charges are not assessed by ROS officials.2.3.9.  Property Not on Property Records.  Government property which is not carried on the propertyrecords should not be recorded simply to initiate a ROS. A survey can be initiated without this andaction will be taken to obtain reimbursement for any government property lost, damaged, or destroyedregardless of whether or not it is considered as "Accountable" property.  This is particularly relevantconsidering the large number of local purchase items that have been deleted from accountable records.2.3.10.  Collection Guidance.  An Air Force member's or employee's consent is not required for col-lection of ROS debts.  The  organization responsible for paying the member or employee shall deter-mine the maximum amount to be collected each month.  Specific collection procedures are inChapter 16.  Overall Air Force policies on debt collection are in DoDR 7000-14R, Volume 1 and 5.2.3.11.  Waiver Provisions - Housing Damage.  10 U.S.C. Section 2775 provides for waiver of liabilityarising under conditions pertaining to both family housing and unaccompanied personnel housing.The Secretary of the Air Force or designee may waive an uncollected claim of the United States, basedupon the unique circumstances of an individual case and determines that the waiver of the claim is inthe best interests of the United States.  This authority is delegated to the ROS approving and appellateauthorities as designated in this manual.  Detailed procedures are in Chapter 17.2.3.12.  Discretionary Limitation of Liability.  The ROS approving or appellate authority may exercisecertain discretion regarding assessments of financial liability as contained in Chapter 8; however, theapproving or appellate authority must assess the full amount of loss for ROS involving liability of anyaccountable officer for various types of property and personal arms and equipment when:2.3.12.1.  An accountable officer whose negligence, willful misconduct, or deliberate unautho-rized use of government property proximately causes the loss of, or damage to, property under hisAFMAN23-220   1 JULY 199611or her accountability, is liable for the entire amount of the loss to the government as computed inaccordance with Chapter 15.  Liability may not be limited to a lesser amount by the approving orappellate authority under paragraph 8.6.2.3.12.2.  An individual whose negligence, willful misconduct, or deliberate unauthorized useproximately causes the loss of, or damage to, personal arms and equipment (also known as indi-vidual equipment) which were issued for the individual's sole use and care.  In these cases liabilityis assessed for the entire amount of the loss of the government as computed in accordance withChapter 15.  Liability may not be limited to a lesser amount by the approving or appellate author-ity under paragraph 8.6.  Personal arms and equipment items are so defined by examining howthey are used rather than how they are obtained.2.3.13.  Joint and Several Liability.  If the loss, damage, or destruction of government propertyresulted from negligence, willful misconduct, or deliberate unauthorized use of two or more persons,they are held jointly and severally liable for the amount of the loss to the government, up to onemonth's basic pay.2.3.13.1.  If, for any reason, collection cannot be made from any person held jointly and severallyliable, the remaining persons are each still liable for the loss to the government up to one month'sbasic pay, or as specified in paragraphs 2.3.12., 8.6., and Chapter 17.2.3.13.2.  Because the Air Force cannot collect more than the total amount of the loss to the gov-ernment, the approving authority determines the amount to be collected from each person.2.3.14.  Loss of Public Funds.  (See paragraph 3.3.4.)2.3.15.  When financial assessment is recommended, a written legal opinion will be obtained  beforethe ROS file is forwarded to the approving authority and an individual is advised that financial liabil-ity is being assessed.  The legal review will be made a part of the ROS file.2.3.16.  Many items used in the Air Force are no longer on accountable records; however, command-ers are still responsible for assuring that they are properly maintained.  When they are no longerrequired or are usable, they will be reported to accountable officers for subsequent turn-in to DefenseLogistics Agency property disposal offices.2.3.17.  There are no legal time limits applicable to initiating a ROS or how rapidly it must be com-pleted;  however, Air Force desired time-frames are contained in Chapter 5 and Chapter 6.2.3.18.  Subject to the provisions contained in Chapter 3, which indicates when a ROS is required,approving authorities may disregard processing a ROS if the value of the loss, damage, or destructionof the property is $500 or less.  This guidance  also applies to family housing.  See chapter 6, AFI32-6001, Family Housing Management. This option must be tempered by the situation pertaining toeach case.  This guidance does not preclude approving authorities or commanders from processing aROS where the loss, damage or destruction is less than $500.  THIS DOES NOT APPLY TO VEHI-CLES - SEE Chapter 18.2.3.19.  If a loss occurs in retail supply system stocks or property record items because supervisors didnot ensure that stocks were not properly inventoried and required transfer procedures were not fol-lowed upon change of  custodians.  This may be the basis for finding an individual negligent in theperformance of assigned duties. (See paragraph 21.4.)12AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 19962.3.20.  ROS Program Managers are encouraged to utilize automated means of processing documentsrelated to the program, including prescribed forms.2.3.21.  When referring to this manual it should be remembered that while it is applicable to all com-mands of the Air Force, they are not all organized the same and do not have the same mission.  Fur-ther, there are many different accountable officers involved in the ROS process, such as the base chiefof supply, information systems for automatic data processing equipment, medical supply, commissary,morale and welfare, and the civil engineer housing officer.  As a result, individual base implementingprocedures may vary from command to command and from base to base.  Except where specific stan-dards or requirements are prescribed, variations are acceptable as long as they comply with the spiritand intent of this manual.2.3.22.  One of the objectives of the ROS program is to point up materiel management weaknesses.Block 10 of the DD Form 200 addresses actions to prevent recurrence.  AFI 23-111, Management ofGovernment Property in Possession of the Air Force (formerly AFR 20-14) should be referred toregarding responsibility for Government property.2.3.23.  Disposition of Funds Received From the ROS Program.  Paragraph 16.2.13.  addresses whatmonies are returned to Air Force operation and maintenance (O&M) accounts and which are returnedto miscellaneous receipts of the US Treasury. These procedures are based on US statutes.2.3.24.  This manual uses two new terms applicable to ROS.  The first is "ROS program manager" inlieu of the prior term of "ROS administrator."  This was done to more clearly portray the duties thatare performed.  The second is the term "Financial Services Officer" (FSO).  This replaces the old term"Finance and Accounting Officer (FAO)."AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 199613Chapter 3  GUIDELINES FOR DETERMINING WHEN A ROS IS REQUIRED3.1.  When a ROS is Mandatory.   A ROS is mandatory when:  (See paragraph 3.3. for details.)3.1.1.  Controlled or sensitive items, weapons, or classified items have been damaged, or destroyedunless exempted by paragraph 3.2.3., 3.2.10., or 3.2.11. below.  These ROSs will be processed accord-ing to this manual.  If the ROS contains classified information, the ROS must bear an appropriateSecurity Classification.3.1.2.  There is evidence of abuse, gross negligence, willful misconduct, or deliberate unauthorizeduse, fraud, theft, or if negligence is suspected in the case of supply system stocks or property bookitems.3.1.3.  Negligence is evident in the loss of hand tools regardless of dollar value unless voluntary mon-etary reimbursement or replacement in kind is offered and accepted.3.1.4.  Hand tools or other pilferable items over $100 unit cost or $500 total cost are lost.3.1.5.  Supply system stock records are adjusted in excess of $2,500 for pilferable items.3.1.6.  Supply system stock records are adjusted in excess of $16,000 for uncontrolled or non-pilfer-able items.3.1.7.  Supply system stock record adjustments exceed $50,000.3.1.8.  Ammunition losses addressed in paragraph 3.46, AFI 21-202, Combat Ammunition SystemsProcedures, require a ROS.  Also see paragraph 3.2.3.3.1.9.  Bulk petroleum losses exceed authorized allowances.3.1.10.  The initial investigation does not identify the cause of the discrepancy in the supply system orproperty account and the discrepancy meets the requirement for a ROS.3.1.11.  Contractor held property is lost, damaged, or destroyed by Air Force military or civilian per-sonnel.3.1.12.  Air Force property is lost or damaged while being carried by a government aircraft or vessel.3.1.13.  Requested by an accountable officer.3.1.14.  Public funds are lost.  See paragraph 3.3.4.3.1.15.  Items are lost, damaged, or destroyed after they have been removed from an aircraft damagedin authorized operations.3.1.16.  Repetitive cases of loss, damage, or destruction occur, even though any one by itself wouldnot warrant the processing of a ROS.3.1.17.  Air Force property is lost, damaged or destroyed while under the control of a non-appropri-ated fund (NAF) instrumentality; however, coordination with the NAF activity is essential becauseitems procured with NAF funds are processed differently than those procured with Operations andMaintenance (O&M) funds.14AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 19963.1.18.  An involuntary payment is to be effected.3.1.19.  When there is evidence of gross negligence, willful misconduct, or deliberate unauthorizeduse pertaining to the loss, damage, or destruction of a government vehicle or vehicle property recordsmust be adjusted.3.2.  When a ROS is not Mandatory. A ROS is not required when:  (See paragraph 3.3. for details.)3.2.1.  An individual voluntarily wishes to pay for property that was lost, damaged, or destroyed andthe item(s) is not one that requires a ROS and is valued at $500 or less.3.2.2.  A vehicle accident investigation report indicates that gross negligence, willful misconduct, ordeliberate unauthorized use were not involved and it is not necessary to adjust property records.3.2.3.  Ammunition losses are covered by AFI 21-202, paragraph 3.46.  Also see paragraph 3.1.8.3.2.4.  Air Force property is damaged from the operation of privately owned vehicles, boats, aircraft,or conveyances.3.2.5.  Property belonging to other DoD activities is lost, damaged, or destroyed by Air Force militaryor civilian personnel.3.2.6.  Major weapon systems components, and attachments are lost, damaged, or destroyed.3.2.7.  An item becomes unserviceable due to fair, wear, and tear.3.2.8.  An item is disassembled for component parts or is salvaged.3.2.9.  Competent authority authorizes an item be abandoned.3.2.10.  Loss, damage, or destruction is caused by Acts of God.3.2.11.  Property is lost in combat operations.3.3.  Detailed Guidance Pertaining to Cases Requiring or Not Requiring a ROS.3.3.1.  Hand Tools and Other Pilferable Items.  When negligence is evident, a ROS is required for alltool losses regardless of unit cost; however, one is not required for hand tool losses when the unit costis less than $100, the total cost is $500 or under, and the maintenance branch chief responsible for theproperty determines that no negligence is involved.  This guidance does not prevent the initiation of aROS when the loss is less than $100/500 and it is apparent that there have been systematic losses oftools over a period of time.  Voluntary reimbursement or replacement in kind is encouraged and maybe accepted in lieu of a ROS.  This $100/500 limit also applies to other pilferable items.3.3.2.  Contractor-Held Property. The Federal Acquisition Regulation  (FAR) and the USAF supple-ments  govern the accounting for government property lost, damaged, or destroyed while in a contrac-tor's possession.  If such property is lost, damaged, or destroyed by an Air Force member or civilianemployee, a ROS is processed under this manual.3.3.3.  Property Lost or Damaged While on a Government Vessel or Aircraft.  Air Force property lostor damaged while carried on a government vessel or aircraft requires a ROS unless it is evident thatthere was no negligence, willful misconduct, or deliberate unauthorized use.  If liability is not evident,either prepare a ROS or use an appropriate accountability document per AFMAN 23-110, Volume II,Part Two. The activity maintaining the property control or accountability record initiates the ROS.AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 1996153.3.4.  Loss of Public Funds.  The loss of public funds not included in the accountability of an FSO ordisbursing officer is subject to a ROS.  These funds usually represent undeposited sales receipts.When the FSO is accountable for the lost funds, the guidance and procedures in AFRs 177-102 and177-108 apply.3.3.5.  Air Force Property Used by Nonappropriated Fund Activities.   Loss of, or damage to, AirForce property under control of nonappropriated fund (NAF) instrumentalities is covered in AFI34-204, chapter 5.   NAF employees designated by AFI 34-204 as accountable for Air Force propertyare acting in a capacity similar to those individuals who are designated custodians of EquipmentAuthorization Inventory Data (EAID) equipment on Customer Authorization/Custody Receipt List-ings (CA/CRL). If Air Force equipment is lost or damaged by a NAF employee, a ROS must be initi-ated.  If negligence is evident, liability is assessed and collection is pursued by notifying the NAFindividual through the employing NAF activity.  If collection is unsuccessful, the employing NAFactivity is requested to withhold pay by whatever means are authorized for collection of administra-tively determined debts.  Also see paragraph 3.1.18..3.3.6.  Damage Involving Private Conveyances.  Damage to Air Force property resulting from opera-tion of privately owned vehicles, boats, airplanes, or other conveyances is not generally subject to theROS process.  Claims, or administrative action against responsible individuals are usually pursuedunder AFI 51-502, Personnel and Government Recovery Claims, and other publications.  If Air Forcemembers or employees are involved, a ROS may be prepared instead of asserting a tort claim for thedamage to Air Force property.  These actions must be coordinated with the legal office.3.3.7.  Loss of Damage Involving Other DoD Property.  Loss of, or damage to, property owned byDoD components, other than Air Force, is handled under the owning component's regulations orinterservice support agreements.  Air Force members or employees held liable for loss of, or damageto, another DoD component's property are subject to ROS procedures of the other component. Collec-tion from members is made under provisions of the DoD Military Pay and Allowances EntitlementsManual.3.3.8.  Deployments.  A  ROS is generally not prepared for loss, damage, or destruction of majorweapons, such as aircraft and missiles, including components and attached equipment, used in autho-rized operations.  Once a deployment is ordered (operational, exercise, or training) all vehicles thatmake up the Augmented Deployable Unit (ADU) in convoy are considered an integral part of theweapon system.  Therefore, from generation through deployment to redeployment and recovery, theentire convoy, except for individual equipment, is exempt from ROS procedures; however, this para-graph must be related to paragraph 3.3.9.3.3.9.  Property Lost During Combat Operations.  Property lost during, or as a result of combat oper-ations is not subject to the provisions of this manual.  It is accounted for per AFM 67- 1, volume 1,part one, chapters 10 and 11.3.3.10.  Equipment Items.  A ROS is not required for nonexpendable items listed on AF Form 2691,Aircraft/Missile Equipment Property Record, when these items are lost in aircraft accidents occur-ring under the circumstances in paragraph 3.3.9. above.3.3.11.  A ROS is not required for other than AF Form 2691 equipment lost in aircraft accidents occur-ring under the circumstances in paragraph 3.3.8.  The aircraft termination message or any documentsigned by a commander indicating that the items were lost in the accident can be used to adjust theappropriate property record.16AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 19963.3.12.  A ROS is not required when loss, damage, or destruction was incident to the following cir-cumstances:3.3.12.1.  Authorized flight, takeoff, landing, taxiing, or ground handling by the pilot, copilot,other crew members, or authorized ground personnel. (Ground handling includes refueling, ser-vicing, loading, and unloading. authorized ground personnel includes maintenance personnel.)3.3.12.2.  Unserviceability due to fair wear and tear.3.3.12.3.  Disassembly for recovery of component parts or salvage authorized by competentauthority.3.3.12.4.  Abandonment resulting from an accident incident to authorized operations.3.3.12.5.  Act of God.3.3.13.  Exceptions to paragraph 3.3.12.3.3.13.1.  A ROS is required for aircraft partially damaged and unserviceable, damaged beyondeconomical repair, abandoned, or destroyed under circumstances other than those described inparagraph 3.3.12. 3.3.13.2.  A ROS is required for repair cycle assets and AF Form 2691 items if they are damagedor lost after removal from an aircraft.  Note: An aircraft may have been damaged incident to autho-rized operations, but once accountable items are removed, they are subject to similar accountabil-ity and standard of care as other property book items.  If these items are lost or damaged afterremoval from the damaged aircraft, this could not be construed as loss of damage incident toauthorized ground handling, and a ROS will be initiated.AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 199617Chapter 4  GENERAL PROCEDURES FOR PROCESSING A ROS (DD FORM 200)4.1.  General Overview of ROS Processing Procedures.   Detailed procedures are in other parts of thismanual.4.1.1.  When property is lost, damaged, or destroyed by an individual or an organization, the organiza-tion that has possession of the property will initiate the ROS and that unit commander, or in somecases the appointing authority, will appoint an investigating officer who will determine the facts in thecase.  The ROS Program Manager will be advised promptly so that a ROS number can be assigned.4.1.2.  The investigating officer must be "disinterested" and have no interest in the custodian-ship, care, accountability, or safekeeping of the property.  Further, when appointed as investi-gating officer, the completion of the investigation becomes a primary duty and the officer will berelieved of other duties or assignments that would interfere with the investigation.4.1.3.  The investigating officer (the term "officer" applies to anyone appointed to investigate thecase), at a minimum, will answer the six questions outlined in para 070203, reference 1.2.2.  Theseare:  what happened, how, where, and when; who was involved, and was there any evidence of negli-gence, misconduct, or deliberate unauthorized use or disposition of the property.4.1.4.  The investigating officer, based on the facts, makes findings and recommendations on the issueof liability of the person(s) involved.4.1.5.  The next step is to refer the ROS to the accountable officer so that the records may be adjusted.Note that this action will not be affected by the action taken by the approving or appellate authority;therefore, the accountable records are adjusted as soon as possible.4.1.6.  Next, the investigating officer allows the person(s) involved to review the case and provide ver-bal or written information to refute the findings and recommendations.4.1.7.  The ROS is then processed to the appointing authority for assignment of financial responsibil-ity against the individual(s) charged or relieving them from responsibility.  If financial responsibilityis to be assessed, the ROS will be referred to the legal office for review.  If the investigating officer hasnot performed a thorough job, the ROS should be returned for reaccomplishment.4.1.8.  In some cases the appointing authority may appoint a financial liability officer to re-investigatethe case.  This is a second investigation and is performed when it is necessary to reevaluate the initialinvestigation or because of the complicated nature of the case.  In most cases, a financial liabilityofficer should not be required if the investigating officer accomplishes a proper investigation.4.1.9.  In unusual cases, the approving authority may appoint a financial liability board to evaluate thefindings of the appointing authority and the financial liability officer.4.1.10.  Upon conclusion of these actions, the approving authority reviews the ROS and assigns finan-cial responsibility or relieves the individual(s) of responsibility.4.1.11.  At this time the ROS is submitted for acknowledgment by the individual(s) charged who areadvised that the ROS action may be appealed to the next level in the chain of command above the per-son who assigned the financial liability assessment.18AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 1996Chapter 5  TIME FRAMES FOR PROCESSING A ROS5.1.  DoD Guidance.   Para A.6., 070301 of reference 1.2.2. allows the Services to set processing timelimits.5.2.  ROS Must Be Acted on Expeditiously.   Processing time limits are outlined below.  They are man-datory for Active Air Force units.  ANG and AFRES units are encouraged to adhere to them if feasible;however, because ANG and AFRES units train on weekends, extended time frames have been establishedto meet the administrative requirements of these organizations.  The program manger, acting for theapproving authority, is responsible to ensure that they are met.  If circumstances preclude adherence tothese time limits, this information must be provided to the ROS program manager so that the ROS file canbe properly annotated.5.3.  Active Air Force Processing Times.5.3.1.  Fifteen days from the date of the discovery of the loss,  the organization will complete the pre-liminary investigation phase - blocks 1 through 8.  This includes obtaining  a ROS Investigation Num-ber and appointing an investigating officer.5.3.2.  Thirty days for the investigating officer and the responsible officer to complete the initiationphase - blocks 9 through 12 and return the ROS to the ROS program manager.  This includes inter-viewing all persons involved in the case.  A detailed list of investigators duties are contained in Chap-ter 7.  These times assume that the person(s) that may be held liable are located on the same base asthe investigator. If it is necessary to obtain statements by mail, these times are additive to the 30 days;however, it is not feasible to indicate the time required to obtain mailed testimony.5.3.3.  Five days for the ROS program manager to send the ROS to the accountable officer for theadjustment of property records and to send a copy of the ROS file to person(s) who may be held liablebased on the investigators findings and recommendations (Attachment 2 and Attachment 3).5.3.4.  Forty days - 30 days for the person(s) who may be held liable to respond to Attachment 2 orAttachment 3 (Intent Notifications) plus 10 days mailing times from and to the program manager.5.3.5.  Five days for the appointing authority to review the file and pass it to the approving authority.5.3.6.  Thirty days if the appointing authority requires a review by a financial liability officer or board.5.3.7.  Twenty days for a legal review if financial liability is recommended.5.3.8.  Five days for the approving official to approve the findings and recommendations.5.3.9.  Total time to complete the ROS - 100 days if there is no assessment of financial liability, 130days if a financial liability officer or board is appointed, and 150 days if financial liability is recom-mended because a legal review is required.5.4.  ANG and AFRES Processing Times.5.4.1.  Forty five days to complete blocks I through 8.AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 1996195.4.2.  One hundred days to complete blocks 9 through 12, 16, and 17.5.4.3.  Total time to complete the ROS - 145 days if no financial liability is assessed. Add 40 days if alegal review is required  (total 185 days) and another 60 days if a financial liability officer or boards isappointed (total 245 days).20AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 1996TIME LIMITS FOR ACTIONS REQUIRED AFTER APPROVAL OF A ROSChapter 6  6.1.  General.   This chapter outlines actions that must be taken after the approving authority assesses lia-bility against a person(s) or received a request for reconsideration, appeal, or waiver.  Chapter 16 outlinesthe details involved in voluntary payments, collections, and refunds.6.1.1.  Within five workdays of the approval authority assessing financial liability, the program man-ager will advise the individual found liable if located on the same base.If the approving authority is atdifferent location from the person found liable, 12 work days is allowed for mail notification withinthe CONUS; however, this target maybe extended by the program manager to fit mail schedules, espe-cially if remote overseas locations are involved.  Sample memoranda sent to the person(s) foundfinancially liable are at Attachment 4 for Non-Government Housing Damage and Attachment 5 forGovernment Housing Damage.6.1.2.  Concurrently with the actions in paragraph 6.1.1., the program manager will advise the FSO torecord the debt on the member's pay record.  Involuntary collection may not begin until the expirationof 30 days from the date that the individual receives notification of  liability.  Within five work daysafter the expiration date, the program manager will advise the FSO to initiate involuntary collection ifno reply has been received from the individual.6.1.3.  Within 30 days of being notified of financial liability, the individual(s) may: voluntarily pay theamount assessed or appeal the assessment to the approving authority if the dollar amount is onemonth's pay or less; however, if the assessment exceeds one month's pay, the individual must notifythe approving authority of the intent to appeal the assessment.  The appeal must be submitted within60 days of the date that the notification was received.6.1.4.  If an appeal is received within the allowed time, the FSO is advised immediately not to collectthe debt until the appeal is ruled upon by the approving authority.6.1.5.  If the debt exceeds one month's pay and the individual indicates that an appeal will be made,the FSO is advised to suspend collection for 60 days plus mailing times. If no appeal is receivedwithin 60 days plus mailing time, the FSO is notified to begin involuntary collection. If the appeal isreceived within the allowed time, the FSO is notified immediately to suspend collection until theapproving authority rules on the appeal.6.1.6.  Within 10 days of action on the appeal, the program manager advises the FSO to close out thecollection action and also advises the individual(s) if the appeal is approved.  If the appeal is disap-proved, the FSO is advised to place the debt collection in suspense pending action by the next higherheadquarters and advises the individual(s) that the appeal request will be forwarded to the next higherheadquarters for action.6.1.7.  Times authorized headquarters above wing level to act on requests for reconsiderations,appeals, or waivers are as follows: The next higher headquarters will act on a ROS within 30 daysafter receipt.  MAJCOMs will act on a ROS within 60 days of receipt and HQ USAF will act on aROS within 90 days of receipt.6.1.8.  Forty-two days, including 12 for mailing, are allowed for an individual transferred to anotherCONUS base to respond to the proposed assessment of financial liability by the former base.  If aAFMAN23-220   1 JULY 199621response is not received by day 42, the program manager will forward the case to the FSO for collec-tion.6.1.9.  Creditor organizations are allowed 45 days to complete due process procedures against civilianemployees.  After this date the program manager will follow up every 30 days until the case isreturned for involuntary collection (see paragraph 16.2.4.).6.1.10.  Within 15 days of receipt of a ruling from a headquarters above wing level disallowing arequest for reconsideration appeal, or waiver, the program manager will forward the case to FSO forcollection.22AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 1996Chapter 7  INVESTIGATING OFFICER - RESPONSIBILITIES AND DUTIES7.1.  General.   The commander to whom the lost, damaged, or destroyed property was issued normallywill appoint an official who will determine the facts in the case and make findings and recommendationsas to assessing or not assessing pecuniary liability against an individual.7.1.1.  The investigating official will be an officer, non-commissioned officer (E-7 or above), or civil-ian employee in grades GS-7, WG-9, WL-5 or WS-1 or above.  If feasible, the investigator will besenior in rank to the person(s) being investigated and be from a unit different from the one involved inthe ROS.  When the investigating "officer" is not senior in rank or grade to the individual being inves-tigated,  the person who appointed the investigating officer will advise the appointing authority inwriting as to why this was necessary.  This document will be made a part of the ROS file as an exhibit.7.1.2.  The investigator must be a disinterested, impartial individual who has no interest orinvolvement in the custodianship, care, accountability, or safe keeping of the property in ques-tion.7.2.  General Duties of Investigators.   The investigator will become familiar with this manual and therequirements for making an investigation.7.2.1.  Paragraph 4.1.3. outlines the six basic DoD requirements for conducting an investigation.7.2.2.  In addition to the DoD requirements, when applicable, the investigator will:7.2.2.1.  Review and evaluate as a minimum the adequacy of existing procedures to protect prop-erty.7.2.2.2.  Determine compliance with existing procedures and directives.7.2.2.3.  Determine the individuals responsible and the type of responsibility assigned (such ascommand, supervisory, or personal).7.2.2.4.  Present facts indicating whether or not negligence or abuse was involved.7.2.2.5.  Determine the proximate cause of the loss, damage, or destruction.7.2.2.6.  Recommend corrective action to minimize or preclude recurrence.7.2.2.7.  Establish when it was first determined that the property was lost or damaged.7.2.2.8.  Determine if the custodian(s) performed their duties properly.  (See Chapter 21.)7.2.2.9.  Determine if the custodians were properly trained.7.2.2.10.  Determine what actions were taken to find lost property.7.2.2.11.  If  vehicle damage is involved, determine if  the operator was properly briefed regardinggoverning directives and if the driver was properly trained.7.3.  Investigation is a Primary Duty.   Conducting the investigation will be the primary duty of theinvestigator until it is completed and blocks 1 through 12 of the ROS (DD Form 200) are completed.AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 199623The investigator will be relieved of normal duties which could impair the expeditious completion ofthe investigation.  See Chapter 5 for allowable ROS processing times.7.4.  Detailed Investigator Duties.   The investigator will comply with the requirements outlined in para-graph 4.1.4. above, ensure that they are well documented in Block 9 of the DoD Form 200 above, and alsowill:7.4.1.  Develop the facts in the case which will logically lead to the findings and recommendations(s).The investigator must interview any persons with a knowledge of the case if they are in the immediatearea.  This includes the person(s) who may have lost, damaged, or destroyed the property.7.4.2.  Obtain written statements from persons interviewed.  These statements will be sworn to inaccordance with the Manual For Courts Martial (1984), Appendix 2, Section 936.  This section autho-rizes the investigator to swear witnesses.7.4.3.  Attach witness statements to the ROS.  They must substantiate the statements and the findingsand recommendations of the investigator.7.4.4.  Ensure that all witnesses are identified by first name, middle initial, last name, rank or grade,SSN, organization to which assigned, and if applicable the address of the witnesses.7.4.5.  Include a statement that will indicate how the witness is (or was) involved in the case or howthe witness has knowledge of the situation.7.4.6.  Indicate in block 9 (Circumstances) of the DD Form 200 whether any laws or directives or pro-cedures were violated.  If the loss relates to the changing of custodians, refer to paragraph 21.4. per-taining to the procedures for transferring accounts from one custodian to another.  Also indicate howthe person(s) involved did or did not exercise ordinary or reasonable care.7.4.7.  Attempt to communicate with witnesses not in the immediate area and obtain written state-ments which the witness will certify as being true and correct to the best of the knowledge and beliefof the witness, or request that the witness prepare a statement and swear to it in front of a notary publicor military official authorized to administer oaths.7.4.8.  Submit a written signed statement outlining the information verbally received from the witnessif the investigator is not able to obtain statements indicated in paragraph 7.4.2. above.  The statementwill contain words to indicate that the statement is a true portrayal of what the witness told the inves-tigator and what investigator believes the witness would have stated if a written statement had beenprovided.7.4.9.  Attach the motor vehicle accident investigation conducted by either military or civilian lawenforcement officials to the ROS.  This must substantiate the investigator's statements, findings, andrecommendations if a ROS is submitted on the accident.  See Chapter 18, ROS Pertaining to Vehi-cles.  In general this states that a ROS on vehicles only will be prepared if there is evidence of grossnegligence, willful misconduct, deliberate unauthorized use, or property records must be adjusted.7.4.10.  Complete blocks 9 (Circumstances in the case and the investigator's findings and recommen-dations) and 10 (Corrective Actions) on the DD Form 200.7.4.10.1.  Ensure that the findings and the recommendations are supported by the testimony of per-sons involved and that the testimony leads logically to the findings and recommendations. Alsosee paragraph 14.1.9.24AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 19967.4.10.2.  Determine if financial liability should be assessed based strictly on the facts and circum-stances of the case.  If financial liability is recommended, it will be based on the value of the prop-erty involved.  It will not be tempered by the fact that financial liability generally is limited to notexceed one month's pay nor by statements made to the investigating officer by the person(s)involved that the assessment of financial liability will cause personal hardship.  Reduction of therecommended assessment of financial liability is a command prerogative and not within the pur-view of the investigating officer.7.4.10.3.  When the person(s) involved responds to the approving authority's Notification ofAssessment Of Financial Liability (Attachment 4 or Attachment 5), comments may be includedregarding the adverse impact that paying the assessed amount will have upon the personnelinvolved.7.4.10.4.  Complete and sign Block 11, then pass the case to the responsible officer for the comple-tion of Block 12.AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 199625COMMANDER'S RESPONSIBILITIES AND DISCRETIONARY AUTHORITIESChapter 8  8.1.  General.   This chapter explains squadron, group, wing/installation, commander's roles regardingROS.  In some instances in this chapter, the term "wing/installation commander" is synonymous withsquadron or group commanders.8.2.  Guidance.8.2.1.  The wing/installation commander is designated as the ROS approving authority. The installa-tion commander usually is the commander of a wing or air base group but may be the commander ofa technical training center or similar level organization. The wing or installation commander also nor-mally serves as the approving authority for ROS initiated by host or tenant units.8.2.2.  Approving authorities are located at HQ USAF, MAJCOMs,  numbered Air Forces.  technicaltraining centers,  wing/installation commanders, and some Field Operating Agencies (FOAs) andDirect Reporting Units (DRUs).  Wing/installation commanders may designate group commanders asROS approving authorities.8.2.3.  The wing/installation commander serves as the reviewing authority for ROS initiated by AirForce ROTC units.  This authority may be delegated to group commanders.8.2.4.  In unusual circumstances, MAJCOM, numbered Air Force, or wing/installation commandersmay delegate approving authority in writing to squadron or other unit commanders if they are operat-ing at locations or in situations that preclude or make ROS processing difficult compared to thoseencountered at the units home station.8.2.5.  Exceptions are outlined in  paragraph 8.5.8.3.  Responsibilities.   Group, wing/installation commanders will:8.3.1.  Be responsible for accuracy, review, and completeness of ROS originating within theirapproval jurisdiction.8.3.2.  Ensure all personnel under their command are thoroughly instructed in property responsibilitiesand are constantly alert to guard against loss, damage, or destruction of  government property.8.3.3.  Ensure personnel under their command comply with this manual.8.3.4.  Ensure the assessment of financial liability against an individual is not used instead of or as aform of disciplinary action.8.3.5.  Develop inspection procedures that will ensure that unit commanders document, monitor, andtake appropriate corrective action pertaining to property loss. damage, or destruction cases that occurunder unusual or recurring circumstances, regardless of the dollar value involved.  In addition, loss,damage, or destruction data from units will be reviewed to ensure that responsible organizations pro-cess ROS when required.  As appropriate, this information will be forwarded to the ROS programmanager for inclusion in the manager's trend data.8.4.  Authority To Delegate Responsibility.26AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 19968.4.1.  Wing/installation commanders may delegate approving authority in writing to group com-manders.  If group commanders become approving authorities, the wing/installation commanders willbe the appellate authorities; however,  if appeals are disapproved by the wing/installation commander,they are forwarded to the next higher commander as indicated in paragraph 17.3.8.4.2.  MAJCOM commanders may delegate to commanders of numbered air forces, technical train-ing centers, or similar levels of command, the authority to take final action on ROS appeals in cases inwhich they did not also serve as final approving authority.  Further, these commanders may delegateauthority to take final action on ROS appeals to members of their immediate staff, however, these del-egations must be in writing.8.4.3.  The authority to approve ROS for leather flying jackets is not delegated below the wing orgroup commander having command authority over the individual who lost, damaged, or destroyed thejacket.  They are not included in the $500 rule of no ROS required;  however, if an individual volun-teers to pay for a lost, damaged, or destroyed jacket, a ROS is not required.8.4.4.  Wing/installation commanders may delegate, in writing, the authority for a ROS program man-ager to approve not processing a ROS if the value is under $500 and a ROS is not required.  The intentof this delegation is to decrease the workload involved in processing unnecessary ROS.  It is empha-sized that this is optional and implementing it may be valid at some bases but not at others.8.5.  Exceptions.8.5.1.  The Commander, HQ USAF Recruiting Service, is the approving authority for ROS originatingwithin recruiting command units.8.5.2.  The Commander, Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI), is the approving author-ity for ROS on property for which accountability is maintained centrally at HQ AFOSI.8.5.3.  The Assistant/Deputy Adjutant General - Air is the approving authority for ROS involvingANG property.8.5.4.  The AFROTC region commander, after administrative review by the group, wing/installationcommander, is the final approving authority for ROS originating within AFROTC units.8.5.5.  The Commander, Joint Communications Support Element (JCSE), is the approving authorityfor ROS originating within this Element.8.5.6.  The Commander, HQ Air Force Space Command, is the approving authority for ROS on prop-erty for which accountability is maintained centrally at HQ Air Force Space Command.8.5.7.  The Director, Worldwide Automated Law Library Systems, Air Force Legal Services Agencyis the approving authority for ROS on property for which the accountability is maintained centrally bythe Director, HQ USAF Legal Services Agency.8.6.  Discretionary Authorities.   Commanders and or approving authorities, if they provide writtenrationale, may exercise certain discretion regarding assessments of financial liability based on the follow-ing guidance:8.6.1.  The approving or appellate authority may not limit the amount of liability pertaining toaccountable officers or individuals who lose, damage, or destroy personal arms and equipmentbased on the conditions outlined in paragraph 2.3.12. AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 1996278.6.2.  The approving or appellate authority may waive occupant liability for government housingbased on the procedures contained in Chapter 17 and Chapter 19.8.6.3.  In cases involving property other than that related to accountable officers or an individuals' per-sonal arms and equipment addressed in paragraph 2.3.12., the approving or appellate authority may,within the bounds of reasonableness, fairness, and equity, impose financial liability in an amountequal to the amount of the loss or damage (up to one month's basic pay), or in some lesser amountdeemed appropriate, or relieve an individual from liability, based on the circumstances of each case.In determining the amount of financial liability, the approving or appellate authority may consider fac-tors including, but not limited to:8.6.3.1.  Degree of abuse or negligence involved.8.6.3.2.  The extent, if any, to which involuntary collection would cause substantial financial hard-ship, constitute a clear injustice, or adversely impact unit morale and discipline.8.6.3.3.  Available government remedies against other culpable persons, and the relative culpabil-ity of all persons whose acts or omissions contributed to the damage or loss.8.6.3.4.  Any prior instances of abusive or negligent conduct toward government property.8.6.3.5.  Degree of risk arising from assigned duties.8.6.3.6.  Experience and training.8.6.4.  If more than one individual is held liable on a ROS in which the approving or appellate author-ity is considering reduction of liability under this paragraph, each person is held jointly and severallyliable for the total of the assessed liability after reduction.  Although collection from each person maydiffer, the actual assessment of liability may not be apportioned. (See paragraph 2.3.13.)28AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 1996Chapter 9  APPOINTING AUTHORITY - RESPONSIBILITIES AND DUTIES9.1.  Appointment.   The appointing authority must be designated in writing by the approving authority.Normally the approving authority is the wing or installation commander.  More than one appointingauthority may be designated.9.2.  Who Else May be an Appointing Authority.   The following are also authorized to serve asappointing authorities:9.2.1.  The commander of a MAJCOM or any officer authorized by the commander for ROS  arisingwithin their command headquarters, if the MAJCOM headquarters is not a tenant on the base.  If it isa tenant, the wing or installation commander could be the appointing authority in addition to havingthe normally assigned duty of being the approving authority.9.2.2.  The commander or deputy of a numbered Air Force, technical training center, or other head-quarters above wing level and wing/installation or group commanders.9.2.3.  Commanders, or their deputies, of all types of bases and geographically separated organiza-tions (GSU) except AFROTC units.  For AFROTC units the region commander serves as the appoint-ing authority.9.2.4.  The commanders of USAF Recruiting Groups and HQ AFOSI/FM.9.2.5.  A person appointed on orders as a member of a financial liability board and who has beenauthorized  to act as an appointing authority.9.2.6.  The commander of an organization above squadron or similar unit level.9.2.7.  The commander of the next higher echelon of command when one of the above is personallyaccountable or has custodial responsibility for the property being surveyed.9.2.8.  Approving authorities.9.3.  Responsibilities of Appointing Authorities.   The first seven responsibilities listed below are man-dated by DoD in paragraph 070301 B, Reference 1.2.2.; however, some are modified for Air Force use.9.3.1.  Appoints a financial liability officer when conditions warrant.9.3.2.  Appoints a board in lieu of a financial liability officer to conduct the investigation, if warranted.Reasons for considering appointment of a board include complexity, size, or unique type of loss dueto negligence or abuse.9.3.3.  Provides administrative guidance to financial liability and investigating officers.9.3.4.  Reviews all ROS, appeals, and waiver requests for accuracy and compliance with this manual.9.3.5.  Approves or disapproves the recommendations of the financial liability officer or the board,and forwards personal recommendations to the approving authority.AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 1996299.3.6.  Takes final action on ROS for normal retail type items used at base level when the amount ofthe loss or damage is less than $2,000 and there is no evidence of negligence, willful misconduct, ordeliberate unauthorized use if authorized to do so by the approving authority.9.3.7.  Approves or disapproves DD Forms 200 when the gain or loss of inventory in Supply SystemStocks is less than $100,000 and authorization has been delegated in writing by the approving author-ity.9.3.8.  Makes recommendations to the approving authority on ROS administrative guidance and pro-cedures.9.3.9.  Examines ROS for unauthorized erasures and alterations, completeness, logical conclusions,findings, and recommendations.9.3.10.  Appoints an investigating officer when the situation warrants.  Examples of this are when:9.3.10.1.  When the unit commander determines that it is not feasible to obtain a disinterestedofficer from the unit even though the unit commander normally appoints the investigating officer.This can easily occur in cases where property book items are involved and the someone in thechief of supply's office may be the custodian and the chief of supply the accountable officer.  Insuch cases the unit commander should obtain an investigator from an organization not involved inthe ROS; however, if this is not feasible, the appointing authority will designate an investigatingofficer from another unit to avoid a conflict of interest.9.3.10.2.  The appointing officer desires to designate investigating officers to ensure that there isno conflict of interest and the investigation is conducted in an objective manner by an impartial,disinterested investigator from an organization different than the one to which the propertybelonged.9.4.  Appointing Authority Responsibilities to the Investigating Officer.   The appointing authoritymust:9.4.1.  In addition to the assistance provided by the ROS program manager, the appointing authoritymay provide additional guidance to the investigating officer by advising how thorough the investiga-tion should be and providing advice and help when required or requested by the investigating or finan-cial liability officer or the president of the financial liability board.9.4.2.  Review the findings and recommendations to ensure that:9.4.2.1.  Any contradictions in the ROS are resolved.9.4.2.2.  The statements of interested persons are confirmed or refuted.9.4.2.3.  Findings are stated clearly.9.4.2.4.  Recommendations are sound and are supported by logical conclusions based on the factsstated in the findings and there is no apparent or possible conflict of interest.9.4.2.5.  Monetary charges are computed correctly.9.4.2.6.  The person(s) who may be found financially liable were interviewed by the investigatingofficer and, if one is appointed, by the financial liability officer or board.This testimony mustbecome a part of the ROS file and it must be weighed against other testimony obtained from otherindividuals, and used in developing the findings and recommendations.30AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 19969.5.  Other Appointing Authority Responsibilities.   The appointing authority must:9.5.1.  Review the evidence included with the ROS and must screen out unnecessaryevidence whileensuring that enough information is there for later reviews.  If more evidence is needed the ROS issent back to the initiator or to the investigating officer.9.5.2.  Ensure that the judge advocate or the legal office perform a legal review of any ROS that rec-ommends that a person be held pecuniary liable, that this review is accomplished before the approvingauthority takes final action, and that it is made a part of the ROS file.9.5.3.  Ensure that all pertinent instructions concerning preparation of ROS were followed before it issent to the approving authority for action.AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 199631Chapter 10  APPROVING AUTHORITY - RESPONSIBILITIES AND DUTIES10.1.  DoD Policy Pertaining to Approving Authorities.   Paragraphs 070301 and 070302, referencel.2.2. are quoted below for Air Force compliance.10.1.1.  Paragraph 070301 (Duties and Responsibilities) reads as follows:      “A.  Approving Authority.  DoD Component Regulations shall designate who may be an approvingauthority.  The approving authority's responsibilities may be delegated; however, the delegations must bein writing.  The approving authority also may act as the appointing authority or designate an appointingauthority in writing. The approving authority shall:“1.  Designate an appointing authority, when needed.“2.  Disqualify himself or herself when a conflict of interest is possible because the loss relatesto property for which he or she is responsible and/or accountable.“3.  Establish procedures and designate a person to initiate and conduct an inquiry immedi-ately after the loss, damage, or destruction is discovered.  (NOTE: Within the Air Force, the unitcommander normally designates the investigating officer; however, this is in consonance with theDoD guidance, because it is an implementing action taken to accomplish the DoD objective).“4.  Ensure that all DD Forms 200 received are accurate and complete. Evaluate each DDForm 200 and either approve recommendations to assess financial liability or relieve thoseinvolved from liability, responsibility or accountability. The approving authority approves or dis-approves all DD Forms 200, regardless of dollar value, unless otherwise delegated in writing.“5.  Ensure that all gains and losses that require a formal investigation are promptly and thor-oughly investigated.  The system used to process DD Form 200 must be frequently reviewed toevaluate the accuracy and timeliness of the investigations.“6.  Ensure that DD Forms 200 are initiated, processed and adjudicated within the time limitsthat may be established by the DoD Components.“7.   Require, if delays occur in the initiating or processing of a DD Form 200, a written expla-nation of the reason for the delay and take appropriate corrective actions. “8.  Ensure that persons held financially liable are so notified, informed of their rights (includ-ing waiver rights if Government housing is involved), and given the opportunity to inspect andcopy the DD Form 200.“9.  Personally evaluate each DD Form 200 when there is evidence of negligence or abuse.“10.  Determine whether to delegate to the appointing authority the authority to approve or dis-approve a DD Form 200 when there is no evidence of negligence or abuse.“11.  Ensure, when financial liability is recommended, or when recommendations appear to beinconsistent with findings, that a judge advocate or civilian attorney has reviewed the findings andprovided an opinion on the adequacy of evidence and its relationship to the finding sand recom-32AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 1996mendations.  This legal review shall be included as a part of the record with the DD Form 200 andcompleted before final action is taken by the approving authority. initialed and documented.“12.  Ensure that corrections of any attested entries are properly initialed and documented.“13.  Overrule, when appropriate, the recommendations of the appointing authority and thefinancial liability officer.  When this action results in the assessment of financial liability, the indi-viduals not previously recommended for liability shall be advised of their rights and afforded anopportunity to exercise their rights.“14.  Formally notify individuals against whom he or she has approved financial liability.”10.1.2.  Paragraph 070302 Summary reads as follows:  “The appointing and approving authoritiesmust act on the DD Form 200 once an individual has been properly notified and given the opportunityto respond to the findings.  Failure of involved individuals to respond to recommendations of financialliability is not a sufficient reason to delay the approval process if the individuals were given a reason-able opportunity to reply...”10.2.  Air Force Requirements Pertaining to DoD Mandates.10.2.1.  Delegation of Responsibilities.  See Chapter 8.10.2.2.  Responsibilities.  Approving authorities will:10.2.2.1.  Take action on a ROS when the amount of financial liability to be assessed is equal to orless than $10,000.  When the amount of financial liability to be assessed is greater than $10,000 orwhen the commander is personally involved, the ROS will be forwarded to the next higher com-mand for action.10.2.2.2.  Take action on ROS for any dollar amount of loss or damage when there is no evidenceof negligence, willful misconduct, or deliberate unauthorized use.10.2.2.3.  Designate an appointing authority in writing or assume the responsibilities of theappointing authority.10.2.2.4.  At their option, authorize the appointing authority to take action on a ROS when theamount of the loss or damage is less than $2,000 and there is no evidence of negligence, willfulmisconduct, or deliberate unauthorized use.  This authorization is included in the written designa-tion of the appointing authority.  If the amount is $2,000 or more, the approving authority acts onthe ROS.10.2.2.5.  Designate in writing the name of the individual, who as the ROS program manager, isresponsible for the efficient operation of the ROS program.  The program manager's responsibili-ties and duties are addressed in Chapter 11.  To ensure that there is only one program manager perbase, the designation will be made by the senior approving authority on the base.10.2.2.6.  Make determinations on appeals of liability.  If denied, send appeals to the next highercommander.10.2.2.7.  Ensure that the facts and circumstances of the case support the findings and recommen-dations of the investigating official.  If not, the approving authority will direct the appointingauthority to reaccomplish the ROS so that the findings and recommendations are logical actions tobe taken based on the facts and circumstances.AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 19963310.2.2.8.  Consider the appropriateness of granting waivers of liability for housing damage whenrequested by the occupant.  If  waivers are not approved, forward the case with the requests forwaiver to the next higher commander for action.10.2.2.9.  Consider appropriateness of reducing or eliminating an assessment of financial liabilitybased on the discretionary authorities granted to commanders in paragraph 8.6.10.2.2.10.  Disapprove recommendations of investigating officials where warranted and notify theindividuals accordingly.10.2.2.11.  Make recommendations to the AFROTC region commander on ROS initiated byAFROTC units.10.2.2.12.  Ensure the ROS is reviewed by a legal officer, that a written opinion is provided on theadequacy of evidence and propriety of the findings and recommendations in cases where financialliability is assessed, and that the legal opinion becomes part of the ROS file.10.2.3.  Tenant Activities.  The wing or installation approving authority takes action on all  ROS orig-inating within tenant activities on or attached to the base for logistical support, including major com-mands, intermediate commands, field operating agencies (FOAs), and direct reporting units (DRUs).This does not apply to ANG tenants unless a specific written agreement exists.10.2.3.1.  In cases where a ROS involves a commander or deputy commander and negligence isevident, the approving authority forwards the ROS to the next higher command for action.  If thecase involves the commander or deputy commander of a MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU,  forward theROS to HQ USAF/LGS for final action.10.2.3.2.  AFROTC units initially process all ROS through their respective host base ROS pro-gram manager to ensure proper preparation, legal review, and processing requirements are met.After review of the ROS, the host base approving authority, or designee, makes a recommendationto the AFROTC region commander; however, final approval authority remains with the appropri-ate AFROTC area commandant.10.2.4.  Consider authorizing repair or replacement in kind.  The approving authority may allow indi-viduals who lose, damage, or destroy Air Force property to satisfy their liability by replacing orrepairing the property; however, the approving authority must ensure the replacement property orrepair to Air Force property meets minimum Air Force standards.  If there is any doubt as to whetherthe replacement property of repair meets Air Force standards, the property or repair will not beaccepted. The approving authority may delegate this responsibility.  For example, the housing officermay be designated to make the determination for government housing damage or the vehicle controlofficer for vehicle damage.10.2.5.  Summary of Actions to Be Taken by the Approving Authority.  The approving authority willtake one of the following courses of action on the basis of personal review of the ROS:10.2.5.1.  Approve the recommendations.10.2.5.2.  Return the ROS to the appointing authority for reaccomplishment or reconsideration.10.2.5.3.  Make new recommendations.10.2.5.4.  Relieve the persons charged with financial liability from responsibility and or account-ability for the lost, damaged, or destroyed property.34AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 1996Chapter 11  BASE ROS PROGRAM MANAGER RESPONSIBILITIES11.1.  General.   This chapter prescribes the responsibilities of the report of survey (ROS)program man-ager.11.2.  Appointment.   Establishing a program manager is an Air Force requirement. Neither of the DoDreferences cited in paragraph 1.2. prescribe or address the requirement for a program manager.  Theapproving authority will designate in writing who will be the ROS program manager.  To ensure that thereis only one program manager per base, the designation will be made by the senior approving authority onthe base.11.3.  Overall Program Manager's Responsibilities.   The manager ensures that all aspects of the ROSsystem function in a timely and efficient manner.  The program manager works directly for the seniorapproving authority on the base in carrying out the responsibilities addressed below.  This includes ROSinitiated by AFROTC and tenant units.  The manager also assists appointing authorities, investigatingofficers and unit commanders as required.  This includes advising the approving and the appointingauthorities if there appears to be, or possibly is, a conflict on interest in personnel involved in processingthe ROS.11.4.  Duties of Program Managers.11.4.1.  Acts as installation focal point for ROS guidance and procedures.11.4.1.1.  Maintains ROS information that will show trends and potential problem areas and willapprise the commander or the approving authority of the status and the results  of the ROS pro-gram.  This information may include statistics such as accountability assessments and the number,type, and dollar value of property lost, damaged, or destroyed by the unit.  This information willbe provided to the next higher headquarters as mutually agreed to by the program managers.11.4.1.2.  As appropriate, keeps the MAJCOM  program manager apprised of the status of the baseprogram in a manner similar to that of the approving authority.11.4.2.  Prepares internal operating procedures, checklists, and related documents.  Also assists andadvises accountable officers, responsible officers, property custodians, financial liability officers, andthe approving authority.  Conducts training as required or as requested.11.4.3.  Provides guidance during investigations to boards and financial liability officers.11.4.4.  Prepares correspondence involved in routing ROS for investigation, staff coordination,review, approval, due process, collection, and other ROS related actions.11.4.5.  Follows up to ensure that ROS are processed expeditiously.  Also ensures that persons whosubmit ROS are aware they must do so promptly.11.4.6.  Ensures the actual cost of repair, or if not available, an estimate, has been obtained beforefinancial liability is assessed.  Identifies any overcharges to be refunded.AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 19963511.4.7.  Ensures individuals being charged as being financially liable are promptly notified and aregiven the opportunity to make a written statement prior to ROS being sent to the approving authority.11.4.8.  Ensures persons held financially liable by the approving authority are informed of their liabil-ity within five work days of the date in block 14h, DD Form 200, Financial Liability Investigationof Property Loss.  If the approving authority is at a different location than the individual held liable,12 work days are allowed for this notification.11.4.9.  Ensures persons held financially liable by the approving authority are informed of their appealrights (and waiver rights in housing damage cases) and are given the opportunity to review the file.11.4.10.  Establishes suspense files to ensure expeditious processing of the ROS within the wing/installation as well as organizations outside of the wing, such as ROS files returned to the initiatingorganization for completion and certification of due process procedures or referred to higher head-quarters for further action.11.4.11.  Assists program managers at other bases when a member transfers before a ROS is com-pleted.11.4.12.  Maintains a manual or computerized ROS register.  Each ROS will be serially numberedstarting with number 1 at the beginning of each fiscal year.  The register and copies of the ROSrecorded on the register will be maintained for reference, use of auditors, and other personnel.  Dis-posal will be as prescribed in paragraph 11.6. below.  ROS that have not been completed by the end ofthe year must be entered on the new form for the new year before logging in any current (new) yearROS.11.5.  ROS Register.   Program manager maintains register on AF Form 453, Report of Survey Regis-ter.  Columns A through G will be completed within 15 days from the reported date of loss (see Chapter5 on ROS Processing Times).  A sample register is at Figure 11.1.  An automated register may be used iflocal computer capability exists.36AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 1996Figure 11.1.  AF Form 453, Report of Survey Register.AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 19963711.5.1.  Column A - Assign a number in sequence to each DD Form 200.11.5.2.  Column B - Record the date a serial number is assigned.11.5.3.  Column C - Record the name and phone number of the organizational point of contact.11.5.4.  Column D - Record the type of form (Financial Liability Investigation of Property Loss, CashCollection Voucher, Pay Adjustment Authorization, or Statement of Charges).11.5.5.

Column K - Explain any unusual circumstances or provide any pertinent comments (forexample, appeal rendered, separation pending, etc.).11.6.  Disposition of Completed Registers and ROS.11.6.1.  Disposition of Completed Registers.  Rule 6, Table 23-23, AFM 37-139 states that registersand comparable forms that provide a complete record of each ROS may be destroyed one year afterfinal action is completed on all entries of a terminated register.11.6.2.  Disposition of Completed ROS.  Rule 11, Table 23-23, AFM 37-139 states that ROS case fileswill be destroyed six years after final action by the appointing or approving authority.11.6.2.1.  Rule 1 also states that ROS are located in the office of the ROS Program Manager.11.6.2.2.  Table 23-23 also contains additional ROS disposition information.11.7.  Local Administrative Procedures.   All installations must prepare base implementing proceduresto this manual.  The type of procedure is at the option of the base or MAJCOM.  For example, it can be asupplement, a base implementing procedure, an operating instruction, or any other appropriate document.Delegations of authority made by the commander or approving authority may be made by position title asopposed to by name.  This will eliminate the need to update them as personnel change.  Further, these del-egations may be made a part of the administrative instructions to ensure their permanence, that they areknown to all concerned, and eliminate the need to include them in the turn-over of files when personnelchange.11.8.  Scheduled Separations.   The initiator of a ROS must advise the program manager if any personwho may have caused the loss or damage to government property is scheduled for separation.  When thissituation occurs, every effort should be made to expedite both the completion of the ROS and the collec-tion action.  This requirement will be included in local administrative procedures mentioned in paragraph11.7.  The program manager also notifies the FSO of the impending debt.38AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 199611.9.  Pending Liability - Individual Transferred.   If an individual transfers to another installationbefore being notified that financial liability is being recommended by investigating officials, the losingbase program manager is primarily responsible for the notification and collection process.  However, boththe losing and gaining base have responsibilities in assuring the individual receives proper notification:11.9.1.  Losing Base Program Manager's Responsibilities.  The losing manager will:11.9.1.1.  Obtain from the losing organization, or from any other source, the name and location ofthe installation to which the individual is being transferred and the name and organizationaladdress of the gaining base ROS program manager.11.9.1.2.  Ensure that  the accountable and responsible officers have signed the DD Form 200.11.9.1.3.  Send the original and one copy of the DD Form 200, and a copy of the complete file tothe gaining base program manager by a transmittal letter.11.9.1.3.1.  The file consists of any documents that are material to the finding of negligenceincluding a copy of the notification letter used locally to advise the individual of impendingcharges.11.9.1.3.2.  The transmittal letter accompanying the complete file will request that formal noti-fication be given to the individual being charged, and that a copy of block 16 of  DD Form 200be completed and returned directly to the losing base program manager.  The transmittal letteralso will indicate the name, organizational address, and telephone number of the losing baseprogram manager. (Samples of the notification letters are in attachments.)11.9.1.3.3.  Establish a 42-day suspense (includes 12 day mailing time) for response from thegaining base.  Upon receipt of the DD Form 200 with block 16 completed, or if no response isreceived after 42 days, processes the ROS for final action by the losing base approving author-ity.  The gaining base is only responsible for notifying the person(s) held liable and obtainingacknowledgment on block 16 of the DD Form 200.Collection procedures are placed in FSOchannels at the losing base.  See paragraph 11.9.2. for gaining base responsibilities.11.9.1.3.4.  If the approving authority does not assess financial liability, the losing managernotifies the persons who were responsible for losing or damaging the property and closes thecase.11.9.1.3.5.  If the approving authority approves the recommendations and assesses financialliability, the losing manager notifies the assessed person(s) accordingly, advising them of theirrights.  A locally developed notification letter will suffice.  If the person held financially liablefails to respond or does not file an appeal or waiver request within 42 days, the losing  managerforwards DD Form 139, Pay Adjustment Authorization, with attached documents to thelocal FSO for involuntary collection of the amount due.  If an appeal or waiver request isreceived within 42 days of notification, process it according to procedures in Chapter 17,Reconsiderations, Appeals, and Waivers.11.9.2.  Gaining Base Program Manager Responsibilities:11.9.2.1.  Upon receipt of ROS documents contact the commander of the individual charged andarrange for pickup or delivery of the documents.11.9.2.2.  Write the losing base program manager to acknowledge receipt of the documents,including the date that the individual or their commander received the documents.AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 19963911.9.2.3.  If it appears that provisions of this manual have not been complied with or there areobvious errors in the ROS, send the file back to the losing base program manager pointing out thediscrepancies.11.9.2.4.  Follow-On Actions.  Once the individual being assessed is notified, advise the losingbase program manager.  At this time the gaining base is no longer involved.  Subsequent actionssuch as rebuttal statements, appeals, waiver requests, and collections, are conducted directlybetween the individual (or the individual's commander) and the losing base.11.10.  Interaction With Financial Services Officers (FSO).   ROS program managers work closelywith the FSO to assure actions related to payroll deductions and collections are processed promptly.11.10.1.  Once the approving authority has assessed financial liability and applicable due process pro-cedures are completed, the program manager provides a copy of the completed DD Form 139, PayAdjustment Authorization or DD Form 362, Statement of Charges/Cash Collection Voucher,with attachments, to the FSO so that the debt can be recorded on the member's Master Military PayAccount (MMPA), however,  the FSO will be requested not to collect the debt for 42 days.11.10.2.  If an appeal or waiver request is filed within the time period specified in this manual, theFSO will be notified to suspend collection of the debt until the appeal or waiver request is ruled upon.This action does not remove the debt from the pay record, but merely suspends collection.11.10.3.  The FSO cannot unilaterally delete or delay processing of a ROS debt without proper docu-mentation.  Collection procedures are outlined in Chapter 16.11.11.  Requests for Assistance.    If situations arise that do not appear to be covered by this manual, thebase program managers should communicate with their command ROS program manager.  To avoiddelays, telephone or E-Mail inquiries are encouraged.40AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 1996Chapter 12  ACTIONS TAKEN ON ROS ABOVE WING OR INSTALLATION LEVEL12.1.  General.   This chapter describes the roles and responsibilities of the intermediate command, majorcommand (MAJCOM), and HQ USAF/LGS in handling ROS and appeals.12.2.  Action on ROS.   Commanders and directors or their designees at the intermediate command,MAJCOM, and HQ USAF/LGS are essentially approving authorities at the higher-command level.  Assuch, they possess the same discretionary authority described in Chapter 8.12.2.1.  Intermediate Command Commander:12.2.1.1.  Takes action on ROS when the amount of financial liability to be assessed exceeds$10,000 but does not exceed $25,000, or when the senior host base commander is personallyinvolved.12.2.1.2.  Forwards a ROS to the MAJCOM commander for final approval when the amount ofliability to be assessed exceeds $25,000, or when the intermediate command commander is per-sonally involved.12.2.1.3.  Approves or disapproves the recommendation of the subordinate commander or makesan additional recommendation.  If the intermediate command commander's recommendationcauses the amount of financial liability to be assessed to exceed $25,000, the ROS is sent to theMAJCOM commander for final approval.12.2.2.  MAJCOM Commander.  Takes action on all ROS not approved at base or intermediate com-mand level, or when the intermediate command commander is personally involved.  If the MAJCOMcommander is personally involved and negligence is evident, the ROS is sent to HQ USAF/LGS forapproval.12.2.3.  HQ USAF/LGS.  Takes action on any ROS when the MAJCOM commander is personallyinvolved.12.3.  Action on Appeals.12.3.1.  The Intermediate Command Commander takes action on appeals related to ROS if the com-mander is the approving authority.  If the appeal is denied, forwards it to the MAJCOM commanderfor final action.12.3.2.  The MAJCOM Commanders take final action "By Authority of the Secretary of the AirForce" on appeals of actions taken by lower-level organizations unless such authority has been dele-gated to the commanders of an intermediate command. Additionally, these commanders may delegateauthority in writing to take final action on ROS appeals to a member of their immediate staffs.  If theMAJCOM commander was the approving authority on the ROS and denies the appeal, it is forwardedto HQ USAF/LGS for final action.12.3.3.  HQ USAF/LGS takes final action "By Authority of the Secretary of the Air Force" on appealsnot granted by the MAJCOM or when the MAJCOM commander is personally involved.AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 19964112.4.

General.   This chapter implements the DoD Regulation cited in paragraph 1.2.2.  Paragraph 0704of the DoDR pertaining to financial liability officers and paragraph 0705 addresses financial liabilityboards.13.2.  Financial Liability Officers (FLO).   Generally an FLO will be a senior officer who, based onexperience, can bring to the case a broad perspective of Air Force policies and procedures. The appointingor approving authority selects FLOs based on their training, experience, aptitudes, and ability to conductintelligent and impartial investigations. The FLO will be an officer, unless the appointment of an NCO(E-7 or above) or a civilian employee (GS-7, WG-9, WL-5, WS-1 or above) is justified in writing by theapproving or appointing authority.13.2.1.  A FLO's findings and recommendations are administrative, not judicial; therefore, the FLOreports are purely advisory; the opinions do not constitute final determinations or legal judgments;and the recommendations are not binding upon appointing and approving authorities.13.2.2.  An FLO is required to be appointed when:13.2.2.1.  The ROS initial investigative results are insufficient to make a determination of whetheror not negligence or abuse was the proximate cause of the loss, damage, or destruction of govern-ment property and approving or appointing authority determines that a second investigation iswarranted.  In most cases, an FLO should not be required if the investigating officer accomplishesa proper investigation.  (See paragraph 4.1.8.)13.2.2.2.  The value of the property lost, damaged, or destroyed, or the circumstances of the casewarrant further investigation such as repetitive losses, evidence of negligence or abuse or largedollar losses.13.2.2.3.  Requested by an accountable officer.13.2.2.4.  Directed by higher authority.13.2.3.  In some cases, the appointing authority may appoint himself or herself as an FLO.  This isespecially true when appointing authorities are also members of financial liability boards.  If an FLOis to be appointed, it must be done within 10 workdays after the appointing  or approving authorityreceives the ROS.13.2.4.  Responsibilities and Duties of an FLO.  These responsibilities and duties are basically thesame as those of any investigating officer and are outlined in Chapter 7.13.2.5.  Additional Responsibilities and Duties of FLOs.  The primary purpose of the ROS is to deter-mine responsibility for lost, damaged, or destroyed property.  To determine such responsibility, thefacts contributing to the loss or damage must be developed by investigation.  The FLO investigationmay establish the fact that some other individual is at fault.  The FLO shall not limit the investigationto verifying statements of interested parties.  Rather, the FLO shall perform an investigation as thor-oughly as is needed to ensure that all facts are fully developed, the interests of the government arefully served, and the rights of the involved individuals are fully protected.AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 19964313.2.5.1.  An FLO investigation is required to determine where responsibility and/or liabilitybelongs without regard to the relationship of the responsible individual to the property. As anexample, actions by the accountable officer, responsible officer, or property receipt holder shouldbe investigated as well as actions of the users of the property.13.2.5.2.  The FLO investigation is a critical phase of the ROS process.  The FLO should deter-mine the actual facts, not as alleged but as they actually occurred.  The FLO's recommendationsshall be evaluated in succeeding reviews; therefore, the recommendations must be supported bythe findings and conclusions.  The FLO:13.2.5.3.  Should be able to make a determination from the findings and conclusions as to how theloss or damage occurred, whether negligence or abuse was involved, and whether negligence orabuse was the proximate cause of the loss or damage.13.2.5.4.  Will record the findings, conclusions, and make recommendations based on findings andconclusions.  The recommendation must indicate whether or financial liability should be assessed.13.2.5.5.  Must afford to any person whose conduct or performance of duty may be subject toinquiry or who has a direct interest in the inquiry an opportunity to have their position considered.They may submit written statements that will become part of the FLO's investigation.13.2.5.6.  Compiles evidence substantiating or refuting any statement prepared by the investigat-ing officer and recorded in block 9 of the DD Form 200.13.2.5.7.  Physically examines the damaged property, when available, and then releases it forrepair or disposal.  If feasible, this will be done on the first day that the FLO was appointed.13.2.5.8.  Consults with or asks advice from the appointing authority, legal office, contractingoffice, security police, program manager, or any other individual or office whose expertise couldhelp determine responsibility.13.2.5.9.  Determines the amount of damage, if the property has been damaged.  The value may bethe cost of repairs or an estimate of the repairs obtained from technical manuals or other reliablesources.  The FLO also determines the value of the property immediately before its damage if theproperty is not economically reparable.  The accountable officer may be asked to assist if he or shehas not been directly involved.13.2.5.10.  Ensures that action is taken to exercise control over the property if the property isrecovered during the investigation.13.2.5.11.  Ensures that the total loss to the Government is computed correctly.13.2.6.  The FLO's Findings.  The FLO will have the advantage of being able to review the previouslyaccomplished ROS.  While this will provide a good starting point, the FLO must rethink any of theconclusions or recommendations made in blocks 9 and 10 of DD Form 200, and develop new findingsand recommendations which may or may not agree with those of the original investigating officer.These will be titled as "FINDINGS" and "RECOMMENDATIONS" in block 15a of the ROS (DDForm 200).13.2.6.1.  The findings and conclusions reached by the FLO must be sound and based upon theevidence presented.  In no case should they contain unsubstantiated opinions or phrases.  The FLOwill state how the loss or damage occurred, based on the evidence obtained through the investiga-tion.  The FLO's findings must substantiate or refute the statements made in block 9 and in affida-44AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 1996vits or in additional statements that are a part of the report.  Where facts are obtained by oraltestimony, the individuals must be named and identified and direct statements quoted.  (See Chap-ter 7 regarding obtaining sworn statements.)13.2.6.2.  The FLO's findings should be complete enough so that others reviewing the report canreadily determine the responsibility without referring the report back to the FLO forfurther inves-tigation or information.  The market or depreciated value of the property is notrequired in the find-ings unless financial liability is recommended.  Where financial liability is recommended, thecomputation is made per Chapter 15.13.2.7.  The FLO's Recommendation.  After recording the findings, the FLO should record the recom-mendations in block 15a.  A recommendation of financial liability or relief from liability is made foreach individual involved.  If financial liability is recommended, the FLO must indicate that the indi-vidual's negligence, willful misconduct, or deliberate unauthorized use was the proximate cause of theloss or damage.  A recommendation also is made for the disposition of any unserviceable property notpreviously disposed of.  Do not, under any circumstances, recommend disciplinary action.13.2.8.  After completing block 15 of the ROS, the FLO returns the ROS file to the program managerfor processing to the appointing or approving authority.13.2.9.  The FLO is not officially relieved from the investigative tasking until relieved by the appoint-ing authority or the approving authority.13.3.  Financial Liability Boards (FLB).13.3.1.  Paragraph 070501, of the DoDR cited in paragraph 1.2.2.  of this manual states that, "A finan-cial liability board may be appointed by the appointing authority for the specific purpose of conduct-ing the investigation.  The primary purpose of a financial liability board is to provide the appointingand approving authorities with adequate information upon which to assess liability or relieve theinvolved individual from liability for the loss, damage or destruction of government property.  Aboard provides more resources than an officer to investigate losses that are large, complex, or unique.Financial liability boards are administrative, not judicial.  Therefore, their reports are purely advisory,their opinions do no constitute final determinations or legal judgments, and their recommendations arenot binding upon appointing and approving authorities."13.3.2.  The members of an FLB are selected based on training, experience, competence, and abilityto conduct independent and objective investigations.  The senior member normally shall be designatedas the Chair or President of the FLB. The appointing authority shall not appoint an individual who wasor is accountable or responsible, or has direct interest in the property, including a financial liabilityofficer who may have previously investigated the loss of the property.13.3.3.  A financial liability board may consist of two or more persons, one of whom is the base claimsofficer. If an attorney, he or she acts as legal counsel for the board. With the recommendation of theorganizational commander concerned, organization claims officers may be appointed by the wing/installation commander to FLBs.  All FLB members are appointed on orders.  A member of the boardis appointed in the orders to serve as appointing authority.  Whenever possible, the person authorizedto serve as appointing authority will be of field grade as well as the other members of the board.13.3.4.  Commissioned officers are normally appointed to FLBs.  Because of the nature of base activ-ities or the type of personnel by which manned, there may not be enough officers available to appointto the board.  If such condition exists, the commander may appoint qualified enlisted personnel toAFMAN23-220   1 JULY 199645grade E-7, E-8, or E-9 or qualified civilian employees in grade GS-7 or above.  The appointing orapproving authority will provide a written statement for inclusion in the ROS file as to why it was nec-essary to appoint NCOs or civilians to the FLB.  Commanders should be extremely careful to selectcompetent personnel to conduct investigations.13.3.5.  Functions of an FLB.13.3.5.1.  The primary function of a FLB is to research, develop, assemble, record and analyze allavailable information relative to the loss.  The board is required to formulate and clearly expressconsistent findings of facts, conclusions, and recommendations.13.3.5.2.  A collateral function of the FLB, especially when requested by the appointing authority,is to afford a hearing to any person whose conduct or performance of duty may be subject toinquiry or who has direct interest in the inquiry.13.3.5.3.  Additional FLB functions are to:13.3.5.3.1.  Make a preliminary review of the ROS.  This is to determine whether or not anFLO is required.13.3.5.3.2.  Perform the function of FLO on ROS when the preliminary investigation indicatesthis is necessary.  Members of the board acting as FLOs should follow the instructions in para-graph 13.2.  The chair or president of the board can limit the scope of the investigation.  Thislimitation must be acceptable to appointing or approving authority.13.3.5.3.3.  Act as a group of disinterested persons to inspect and witness the destruction orabandonment of unserviceable property.13.3.6.  Use of Investigative Reports.  Reports of investigations of accidents or incidents may be usedinstead of investigations to support a ROS, depending on the circumstances.  The FLB uses theseinvestigative reports to determine the need for an FLO, determine financial liability or reliefthere-from, and make recommendations on the disposition of property and action to be taken byhigher authority.13.3.6.1.  When an FLO is required, the investigative report is used to support findings and recom-mendations.  The FLO is not required to duplicate any part of the investigative report unless thereis an indication that the investigation was incomplete.13.3.6.2.  Investigative reports are attached to the ROS as exhibits.13.3.7.  Board Action on ROS.13.3.7.1.  The board members take action on the DD Form 200.  If a board member is appointed toserve as FLO, he or she complies with the duties and responsibilities outlined in paragraph 13.2. 13.3.7.2.  When the FLB completes its action, the ROS file, with the FLB documentation attachedas a exhibit, will be returned to the ROS program manager for processing to the appointing orapproving authority.46AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 1996Chapter 14  COMPLETING DD FORMS 139, 200, 362, AND 113114.1.  DD Form 200, Financial Liability Investigation of Property Loss.   A sample completed DDForm 200 is at Figure 14.1.  Many blocks in the form are self explanatory, therefore, explanatory notesare provided only to further explain selected entries or to emphasize the entry.  Prepare and complete theDD Form 200 as follows:AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 199647Figure 14.1.

The original and one copy will be provided tothe program manager.  If the originating office wants a suspense file copy with the control number inblock 2 returned to them, then that office will provide an original and two copies.  More copies can bereproduced, if required, to fill the requirements of the base.14.1.2.  Block 2.  The ROS program manager assigns a control number within the first15 days of thedate the ROS is initiated (see Chapter 5).  This provides a control or suspense for completion of theinitiation phase.14.1.3.  Block 4.  Enter either the national stock number or manufacturer's part number.  In the eventthere is no stock or part number, enter "N/A."  Any number of transactions can be listed, as long asthey pertain to the same incident and the persons responsible for the property are the same.  Use anattachment if needed for additional items.14.1.4.  Block 5.  Enter the correct name of the property lost, damaged, or destroyed, including anyserial numbers.  If the property is not stock listed, give an accurate description sufficient for identifi-cation.  If only a portion of a major item is damaged, describe the major item fully, then describe thedamages.  If a vehicle is damaged, describe the type of vehicle and vehicle number.  If additionalspace is needed, use bond paper, suitably captioned, as a continuation sheet.14.1.5.  Block 6.  Enter the quantity and  if applicable, standard unit measure for the item.14.1.6.  Block 7.  Enter actual unit cost or standard price (current replacement cost). A copy of theCustodian Authorization/Custody Receipt Listing (CA/CRL) or a copy of the Automated Data Pro-cessing Equipment (ADPE) listing that identifies the current replacement cost of the lost, damaged orstolen item(s) should be forwarded with the ROS.  Questions regarding prices should be referred tothe officer who is accountable for the property.14.1.7.  Block 8.  Enter the result of quantity times unit cost.  If a vehicle is involved include labor andmaterial cost.  If a vehicle has been damaged, include a copy of the estimate of damage (EOD) oractual cost document if the vehicle has been repaired.14.1.8.  Block 9.  The individual who initiates or investigates the ROS completes this block.  SeeChapter 7, Chapter 9, and Chapter 10.  The recommendation of the investigating official should beincluded in this block or attached as an exhibit to the ROS.  Further, if negligence, willful misconduct,or deliberate unauthorized use appears to be evident, the amount of financial liability recommendedwill be computed.  Block 9, if properly accomplished, can make the appointment of a financialliability officer unnecessary.  Further, the information in this block can assist the appointing orapproving authority in making a determination of whether or not negligence, willful misconduct, ordeliberate unauthorized use was the proximate cause of the loss, damage, or destruction.14.1.8.1.  At HQ AFMC depot maintenance activities the Tool Loss Report (TLR) can be submit-ted with the ROS instead of completing block 9.  The TLR must contain a detailed explanation ofthe facts and circumstances of the loss as required in this block.14.1.8.2.  Include the equipment authorization inventory data (EAID) detail document number asapplicable.14.1.9.  Block 10.  If investigations reveal deficiencies in directives, procedures, controls, etc., a state-ment of corrective action is required to document the action that was taken or will be taken to preventrecurrence of the incident.  The originating office or the initial investigating official prepares the cor-rective action statement.AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 19965114.1.10.  Block 12b.  The responsible officer or the reviewing authority enters his or her commentsand recommendations.  Use an attachment if needed.14.1.11.  Block 13b.  The appointing authority enters comments or rationale for the decision.  Use anattachment if needed.14.1.12.  Block 14a.  The approving authority either approves or disapproves the recommendations ofthe investigating officer in block 9 or of block 15a if a financial liability officer was appointed.14.1.13.  Block 14b.  Use this block to specify the amount of financial liability assessed, relief fromliability, and to describe disapprovals and prerogatives exercised under the provisions of waivinghousing damage or discretionary limitations of liability.  Use an attachment if needed.14.1.14.  Block 15i.  Enter the date the financial liability officer was appointed.14.1.15.  Block 16a.  The individual charged places an X in the proper box.  If a financial liabilityofficer was not appointed the individual charged should respond to the findings in blocks 9 through12.14.1.15.1.  When financial liability is recommended, the individual has the right to examine thefindings and recommendations, to examine the evidence supporting the findings, and to submitevidence and statements on one's behalf which might refute any finding of negligence and whichwould be relevant to a determination of who should be held liable.  This requirement must beaccomplished before the ROS is sent to the appointing and approving authorities.14.1.15.2.  If financial liability has not been previously recommended but the appointing authoritymakes a recommendation of financial liability, the individual charged must be given the right toreview the file and make a statement prior to a determination being made by the approving author-ity.14.1.15.3.  If housing damage is involved, a member must be advised that a fully substantiatedwaiver request may be submitted to the approving authority.  Factors to be considered are in para-graph 19.7.  (The waiver request is only considered if liability is eventually assessed by theapproving authority, but must be submitted upon completion of block 16.)  In the absence of a spe-cific waiver request, a member will automatically receive waiver consideration based only on theROS findings.14.1.15.4.  If an individual does not sign a copy of the ROS in block 16g or does not respond tonotification within 30 days, the original ROS is sent by the program manager to the appointing andapproving authorities for assessment of or relief from financial liability.  The reason for sending acopy is that the program manager must have the original on file at the completion of the case.Sending a copy precludes the loss of the original.  Military members are entitled to free legalcounsel.  All Air Force members and employees are entitled to a copy of the completed ROS.14.1.16.  Block 16b.

Enter the date the individual charged signed the DD Form 200.14.1.23.  Block 17a.  Enter the document numbers used to adjust the prepay records, if applicable.  Ifnot applicable enter "N/A".  Blocks 17a through 17f should be completed following completion ofblock 12 in order that property records can reflect any adjustment at the earliest possible date and priorto completion of other actions on the DD Form 200.14.2.  Privacy Act Statement, DD Form 200.   Preparation of a ROS does not normally require request-ing personal information; however, the privacy act statement is printed at the top of the DD Form 200.14.3.  Distribution of DD Form 200.   The ROS will be prepared in an original and as many copies as arerequired by the base.14.3.1.  The original of the ROS and one copy is forwarded to the program manager for a control num-ber.  The copy is used as a suspense copy by the manager.  The originating office may also forwardanother copy of the ROS to the program manager who will return it to them with the assigned controlnumber for use as a suspense file.  The program manager will prescribe the ROS processing proce-dures for the base.14.3.2.  If the ROS results in an assessment of financial liability by the approving authority, a copy isforwarded to the FSO to establish the debt on the employee's pay account.  The original of the ROS iskept with the program manager's files pending disposition in accordance with section 23, AFM37-139, that replaces volume 20, table 177-9, AFR 4-20.14.4.  Voluntary Payments.   Persons who have lost, damaged, or destroyed government property valuedat $500 or less may voluntarily pay for the property.  These situations are outlined in Chapter 3.14.4.1.  Voluntary Payment.  Voluntary payments are processed on DD Form 1131, Cash CollectionVoucher, or DD Form 362, Statement of Charges/Cash Collection Voucher.14.4.2.  Document Processing Requirement:14.4.2.1.  In accordance with base agreements and ROS implementing procedures, either the unitcommander or the ROS program manager will initiate voluntary payment documents for the loss,damage, or destruction of government property issued to their activities or to persons under theadministrative control of the organization.  This applies to property on Equipment AuthorizationInventory Data (EAID) records, individual clothing and equipment records, and other similaraccountable records or custody receipts.14.4.2.2.  Voluntary payment documents must contain the statement, "Used instead of a ROS" ifthey are processed under the provisions of Chapter 16.14.4.2.3.  Where lost, damaged, or destroyed property is recorded on property control records, thevoluntary payment document must be used to support adjustment of the property account.14.4.2.4.  The ROS program manager develops and issues procedures for preparing and process-ing voluntary payment documents.14.4.2.5.  Additional information regarding voluntary payments is in AFM 67-1, volume IV, partone, chapter 8, paragraph 6.AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 199653Chapter 15  COMPUTING FINANCIAL LIABILITY15.1.  General.   Use the provisions of the chapter to compute and document the amount of financial lossto the government.  The loss to the government is also the basis for assessing financial liability againstindividuals.15.1.1.  Where financial liability is limited to one month's basic pay the actual loss to the governmentis still computed even if it exceeds one month's pay.  In such cases, the financial liability against anindividual is either the actual loss or one month's basic pay, whichever is less.15.1.2.  Establishing Amount of Loss.  The manner by which the government's damages are measuredis determined by principles of law.  Ascertaining the amount of damages is based on fact which mustbe proved by evidence.  ROS prepared on the basis of damages to government property resulting fromnegligence must establish both the facts of actual loss to the government and negligence, willful mis-conduct, or deliberate unauthorized use of the person or agency concerned.  In addition, evidencemust be submitted to establish the amount of the loss according to the following principles:15.1.2.1.  Lost or Destroyed Property (Figure 15.1. and Figure 15.2.).  The amount of loss is themarket value of the property immediately before the loss.  In absence of a fair market value, usethe adjusted replacement cost (paragraph 15.2.).54AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 1996Figure 15.1.  AF Form 20, Repair Cost and Reparable Value Statement (Damaged Property).AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 199655Figure 15.2.  AF Form 20, Repair Cost and Reparable Value Statement (Lost Property).56AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 199615.1.2.2.  Irreparably Damaged Property and Property Damaged Beyond Economical Repair.  Theamount of loss is the market value of the property immediately before the damage less any salvagevalue.15.1.2.3.  Reparable Property.  Where property is damaged and can be economically repaired, themeasure of the damage is the difference in the market value of the property immediately before thedamage and its market value immediately before the damage and its market value immediatelyafter the damage in its injured condition.15.1.2.3.1.  While the difference in values is generally the standard measure of the govern-ment's loss, the reasonable cost of the repairs necessary to restore the property to its conditionbefore the damage may be used as evidence of the difference in the value of the propertybefore and immediately after the damage. Hence, the reasonable cost of repair less any estab-lished overhaul allowances as outlined in paragraph 15.3. may be proper, provided the repairsdo not increase the value of the property above its market value before the damage.15.1.2.3.2.  The government is not entitled to the full value of the repairs if they make theproperty more valuable than it was before the damage.  Thus, the amount of the loss would bethe cost of repairs less any increase in value.15.1.2.4.  Reparable Property - Military Family Housing.  The cost of repair includes the follow-ing elements:15.1.2.4.1.  Labor costs, including in-house labor (paragraph 15.1.5.) and contractor labor.15.1.2.4.2.  Cost of government-provided equipment and furnishings, (cooking stoves,couches, chairs, tables, washer, dryer, refrigerator, etc.) based on fair market value before lossof damage.  In the absence of a fair market value at the time of loss or damage, use the adjustedreplacement cost (paragraph 15.2.)15.1.2.4.3.  Cost of installed equipment (furnace, hot water heater, central air conditioning,etc.) based on adjusted replacement cost.15.1.2.4.4.  Cost of fixtures, cabinets, book shelves, etc., based on adjusted replacement cost.15.1.2.4.5.  Cost of direct materials such as lumber, paint, wallboard, nails, adhesives, etc.15.1.3.  Use of Actual or Estimated Repair Charges.  Where financial liability is assessed against anindividual for damage to property that is reparable, the amount to be assessed in the ROS is based onactual cost of repair.15.1.3.1.  Estimated repair costs may be applied to ROS only in unusual and exceptional circum-stances where actual repair costs cannot be obtained within a reasonable length of time (for exam-ple, where it is determined that the damaged property cannot be immediately restored to use, orwhere the repairs are unduly delayed due to lack of parts or backlog in the repair facility orrequirement to ship the property to another facility for repair, or similar situations).15.1.3.2.  In such cases, the reason for using estimated repair costs must be fully documented onthe ROS.  An estimated cost of repair is computed by qualified technical personal on the basis ofcurrent applicable labor rates and material costs necessary to accomplish the repair.  Estimatedcosts are converted to actual costs upon completion of the repair and the ROS is amended accord-ingly.  If collection action is complete, see paragraph 16.2.3.AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 19965715.1.4.  Transportation Costs.  Where it is necessary to transport the damaged property for repairs to arepair facility, the transportation costs to and from the facility may be included, if it is shown thatrepairs were not obtainable locally at less cost.  If a government bill of lading (GBL) is used, the trans-portation cost is the amount paid the carrier.  If government transportation is used, standard labor ratesin AFI 65-503 are used to determine labor costs.15.1.5.  Repair Costs and Costing Methods.  For the purpose of determining financial liability onROS, only direct labor and direct material are charged when repairs are done in-house.  Indirect oroverhead costs are not charged.  When repairs are performed by a private contractor, the amount paidto the contractor is charged. Direct labor and direct material are further defined as follows:15.1.5.1.  Direct Labor.  Direct labor charges computed by the Base Engineer Automated Manage-ment System (BEAMS) or by the On-Line Vehicle Interactive Management System (OLVIMS)are acceptable for determining labor costs for in-house repairs of facilities and vehicles.  Directlabor charges generated by the Real Property Industrial Fund (RPIF) cost systems are also accept-able for facilities repair.  In absence of these methods, direct labor is computed by applying thestandard labor rate in AFI 65-103 to the actual man-hours worked to repair the damaged property.15.1.5.2.  Direct Material.  Actual cost of all direct material drawn against the reimbursable repairjob (excludes bench stock materials) as identified by BEAMS, VIMS, RPIF, or other sources.15.1.6.  Repair in Non-Air Force Government Facilities.  When property is repaired by a non-AirForce government facility, the amount of financial liability is the amount reimbursed to the otheragency per the cross-servicing agreement plus any expense to the Air Force (transportation, etc.).15.1.7.  Repair Cost Statements.  When damaged property is repaired, include one copy of AF Form20, Repair Cost and Reparable Value Statement (Damaged Property) is filed with the ROS.  Asample completed form is at Figure 15.1.  A technical qualified person signs the form.  Support theform with copies of invoices, payment documents, freight bills, GBLs, etc., as appropriate.15.1.8.  Market Value.  In general, the market value is the price a willing buyer would pay a willingseller.  This value is based on estimates of those familiar with the selling process or by open marketprices such as those attainable from surplus stores.  Consider the market value at the time and place ofloss or irreparable damage, using the nearest available market.15.1.9.  Property Having No Market Value.  Where property has no market value established, deter-mine the value by using the adjusted replacement cost method described in paragraph 15.2.15.1.10.  Leather Flying Jackets.  An exception from the procedures of this paragraph is made forleather flying jackets.  HQ USAF/LGS has determined that when a leather flying jacket is lost, dam-aged, or destroyed through negligence as determined by the ROS process, the member is required topay the current stock list price for a new leather flying jacket prior to being  issued another leather fly-ing jacket.15.2.  Adjusted Replacement Cost.15.2.1.  Computation Method.  In the absence of a fair market value for property at the time and placeof loss, irreparable damage, or damage beyond economical repair, determine the government's lossbased on the adjusted replacement cost.  This method consists of determining the current replacementcost of a like item, depreciating the replacement cost by the number of years the lost or damaged item58AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 1996was used (based on an estimated or published useful life of the item) and subtracting the salvagevalue, if any, of the damaged item.15.2.2.  Any generally accepted depreciation method may be used.  The preferred method is one thatmost realistically represents the value of the property at the time of loss or damage.  Officially pub-lished depreciation standards and factors should be considered.  Other factors to be considered inarriving at a realistic measure of loss are:15.2.2.1.  The actual condition of the property before its loss or damage and the expected contin-ued length of serviceability of the property had it not been lost or made unserviceable.15.2.2.2.  Where possible, individual major assembly maintenance or historical records should beconsulted to determine the serviceability of components or subassemblies which would haverequired immediate replacement of overhaul, had not the major assembly been lost, irreparablydamaged, or damaged beyond economical repair.15.2.2.3.  In computing allowances for any serviceable spare parts recovered, use the same depre-ciation method as applied to the end item.15.2.3.  Computation Statement.  When allowances are made for depreciation, ROS initiators orinvestigating officials must include a statement indicating the factors considered and methods bywhich the depreciation was computed so that a proper assessment may be made by the approvingauthority.  This statement or other documents will be attached to the file and will show:15.2.3.1.  Source of published depreciation factors.15.2.3.2.  Date of manufacture.15.2.3.3.  Original acquisition cost.15.2.3.4.  Replacement cost of a like item and source of this quotation.15.2.3.5.  Estimated life expectancy.15.2.3.6.  State of obsolescence.15.2.4.  Small Tools.  Small hand tools are considered useful throughout their entire life and, there-fore, are not depreciated.15.2.5.  Depreciation of Parachutes.  The value of lost or destroyed parachutes is determined by usinga depreciation rate of 14 percent per year on the invoice or stock list price, not to exceed a total of 80percent.  This is a standard or norm and may be varied under exceptional circumstances.15.2.6.  Depreciation of Vehicles.  Depreciation is based on the age or mileage life expectancy tablesas shown in Technical Order-00-25-249, Maximum Repair Allowances and Replacement Codes forUSAF Vehicles.  Use straight-line depreciation, not to exceed 80 percent.  Deduct the estimated costof any repairs that were required before the loss or destruction.  Deduct reclaimed (salvaged) parts at50 percent of the Air Force cost for a like item.15.2.7.  Useful Life and Disposal Value Table.  Reference also may be made to the "Useful Value andDisposal Value Table" which is attachment 2 to AFP 26-12, Guidelines for Implementing the AirForce Commercial Activities Program, 25 Sep 92. The AFP 26-12 will be converted to AFM 38-209in 1996 or 1997.  This table provides a listing of Federal Stock Classes (FSCs), nomenclatures,expected useful life in years, and a disposal value factor as a percent of acquisition cost.  This is a Fed-AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 199659erally developed list extracted from the Supplement to Office of Management and Budget Circular A76 (Revised), Performance of Commercial Activities, Aug 4, 1983.15.3.  Standard Overhaul Allowances.   An allowance may be made for standard overhaul chargeswhen they are established.  The inclusion of the overhaul is a matter of judgment on the part of investigat-ing officials.  If the property is comparatively new, has not been in use long enough to require repair, orhas been recently overhauled, no allowances should be granted.15.4.  Credit for Salvage.   When property is damaged to the point where it must be scrapped, salvagecredit is allowed for the salvage or scrap value, including the scrap value of parts recovered from the prop-erty which has been repaired.15.4.1.  In no case is the full list price of such parts allowed for salvage credit. If entire units are sal-vaged, credit is determined by the property disposal officer based on the scrap value of the entire unitor the value of the scrap recovered plus the current value of major serviceable subassemblies, if any.15.4.2.  In no case is credit given for each component part of entire units or subassemblies that are sal-vaged.  If, after the total assembly is depreciated, serviceable parts are recovered by disassembly ofunits or subassemblies, the value of the parts recovered is not considered for the purpose of giving fur-ther credit in computation of financial liability.15.5.  Determining Costs for Lost Property.   A sample completed AF Form 20 pertaining to lost prop-erty is at Figure 15.2.60AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 1996Chapter 16  VOLUNTARY PAYMENTS, COLLECTIONS, AND REFUNDS16.1.  Voluntary Payments.16.1.1.  Paragraph 070204 of the DoD Regulation cited in paragraph 1.2.2. prescribes DoD policy per-taining to voluntary payments and is implemented in this chapter.16.1.2.  Guidance.  Air Force members and employees may voluntarily pay the government for lost,damaged, or destroyed government property.  Voluntary payment may be made any time before orduring the ROS process.  In some cases, voluntary payments are made in lieu of a ROS.  In othercases, voluntary payments are made as a result of an investigating official's recommendation orapproving authority's assessment.  Voluntary payment may be accepted in lieu of a ROS providing thefollowing criteria are met:16.1.2.1.  The individual is offering the payment on his or her own volition and is not beingcoerced or threatened with adverse action if payment is not made.  Adverse action could consist ofadministrative action and judicial or nonjudicial punishment.16.1.2.2.  The individual is aware that no administrative determination of a debt exists, and thatthere is no legal obligation to the government.16.1.2.3.  The individual is aware that voluntary payment may not be withdrawn later.16.1.2.4.  The individual is aware that the normal avenues of relief (appeal, waiver, remission,etc.) are not available if voluntary payment is made.16.1.2.5.  If the individual is offering to pay for loss or damage in excess of one month's basic pay,the person must be made aware that if a ROS were prepared, the liability might be limited to onemonth's basic pay.16.1.2.6.  If the loss or damage exceeds one month's basic pay, and the individual offers to volun-tarily pay one month's basic pay, voluntary payment can be accepted if the loss or damage does notinvolve:16.1.2.6.1.  Assigned government housing damage where gross negligence or willful miscon-duct may be evident.16.1.2.6.2.  Loss or damage to personal arms or equipment.16.1.2.6.3.  Loss or damage where an accountable officer is involved.16.1.3.  Completing the DD Form 200.  When a ROS investigating official has recommended anassessment of financial liability in block 9, DD Form 200, the individual responsible for the loss ordamage may voluntarily pay the amount specified on the DD Form 200 unless the assessment is areduced liability.16.1.3.1.  If the investigating official recommends reduced liability, the approving authority mustreview and sign the DD Form 200 before the individual responsible for the loss or damage mayvoluntarily pay the recommended amount.AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 19966116.1.3.2.  In these situations, the ROS process is terminated and the register is annotated to reflectvoluntary payment.  By making voluntary payment at this time, the individual thereby relin-quishes the right of appeal, waiver, remission, or any other relief from financial liability.16.1.4.  Payment by the Individual.  An approving authority has assessed financial liability against anindividual, that individual may voluntarily pay the amount assessed.  In this instance, the ROS is finaland further processing is not necessary.16.1.4.1.  In this case however, a legal debt was administratively determined, and the individualmay later appeal the assessment of financial liability within the time limit prescribed in Chapter17.16.1.4.2.  The person should be made aware that remission or waiver of claims is not availablebecause the debt was paid.16.1.5.  Voluntary Payment Documentation.  Voluntary payments are processed on DD Form 1131,Cash Collection Voucher or DD Form 362, Statement of Charges/Cash Collection Voucher.16.1.6.  Document Processing Requirement:16.1.6.1.  Unit commanders initiate voluntary payment documents for the loss, damage, ordestruction of government property issued to their activities or to persons under their command oradministrative control. This applies to property on Equipment Authorization Inventory Data(EAID) records, individual clothing and equipment records, and other similar accountable recordsor custody receipts.16.1.6.2.  Voluntary payment documents must contain the statement, "Used instead of a ROS".16.1.6.3.  Where lost, damaged, or destroyed property is recorded on property control records, thevoluntary payment document must be used to support adjustment of the property account.16.1.6.4.  The ROS program manager develops and issues procedures for preparing and process-ing voluntary payment documents.16.2.  Collections.16.2.1.  General.  This paragraph establishes collection procedures to be followed when financial lia-bility is assessed; and when repayment of an amount collected or withheld is in excess of the amountdue is required.16.2.2.  Collection From Air Force Members and Employees (Including All Air Force, Air ForceReserve, Air National Guard (ANG), Active Guard/Reserve (AGR) Personnel Including Civilian andANG Technicians).16.2.2.1.  When an Air Force member or employee is held financially liable, the approving author-ity notifies the individual in writing of the type and amount of the debt.  The written notificationadvises the individual of the following:16.2.2.1.1.  The requirement to make lump-sum remittance within 30 days from the date of thewritten debt notification direct to the FSO and the right to request a written agreement to repaythe debt in installments.  A request for installment payments must be accompanied by thedebtor's financial statement submitted under penalty of perjury.16.2.2.1.2.  The right to inspect and copy records relating to the debt.62AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 199616.2.2.1.3.  The right to review the decision relating to the debt.16.2.2.1.4.  Notification of an enlisted member's right to request a remission of indebtednessand an officer's right to request SAF waiver for damage to government housing.16.2.2.1.5.  The right to appeal the findings of the ROS.  Appeal must be submitted within 30days from the date an individual is notified of financial liability. (EXCEPTION: In caseswhere the amount of assessed liability exceeds 1 month's basic pay, a written intent to appealmust be submitted within 30 days and the appeal must be submitted 60 days from the date theindividual is notified of financial liability.)16.2.2.1.6.  The intention of the Air Force to make involuntary deductions from the individ-ual's pay if voluntary lump-sum payment is not made within 30 days of liability notification orcompletion of the appeal process if an appeal is filed and the financial liability is upheld.16.2.2.1.7.  That any portion of the debt uncollected at time of employment termination is col-lected from the individual's final pay and allowances.16.2.2.2.  Written notification is either hand-delivered with a receipt of notice executed or sent bycertified or registered mail with return receipt requested.  Because the Air Force must be able todemonstrate that individuals held financially liable have received demand letters and notices ofintent to effect involuntary collection, these receipts are included in the ROS case file.16.2.2.3.  See AFR 177-102, paragraph 29-2, for additional information on collections.16.2.3.  Collections From Members:16.2.3.1.  Statutory authority for the involuntary collection of an indebtedness from a member is37 U.S.C. Section 1007.  Notification procedures prescribed in paragraph 16.2.2. satisfy require-ments to effect involuntary collections.  Remission and or waiver processing is accomplished bythe FSO. (paragraph 16.2.6.)16.2.3.2.  If remittance is not received within 30 days from the date the Air Force member is noti-fied of financial liability and the member does not submit an appeal to the ROS findings within 30days (or indicates in writing the intent to appeal when the 60-day appeal time frame is appropri-ate), the approving authority sends a completed copy of the DD Form 200, Financial LiabilityInvestigation of Property Loss, to the FSO for involuntary collection action.  This includes evalu-ation of the member's request to make installment payments.  In compliance with DoD 7000.14-R,the approving authority certifies the completion of due process procedures in paragraph 16.2.2.16.2.4.  Collections From Civilian Employees:  (Also see DoD 7000.14-R, volume  8, chapter 8.)16.2.4.1.  General statutory authority for the involuntary collection of an indebtedness from anappropriated fund civilian employee, ANG technician, or Air Force Reserve technician is 5 U.S.C.Section 5514. Notification procedures prescribed in paragraph 16.2.2. do not satisfy requirementsto effect involuntary collection under this statute. ROS appeal channels must be exhausted beforeinvolving involuntary salary offset under 5 U.S.C. Section 5514.16.2.4.2.  If appeal is not submitted within established time frames, ROS appeal rights are for-feited.  If the appeal right is forfeited or if the appeal is denied by the appellate authority desig-nated to take final action on the appeal, the case file is returned to the ROS approving authority(creditor organization).  The creditor organization must then make sure notification and due pro-cess protections required by DoD 7000.14-R,  chapter 8, paragraph 080303 are applied.  AuthorityAFMAN23-220   1 JULY 199663to offset from retired civilian pay is in 31 U.S.C. Section 3716 and is prescribed by AFR 177-104,paragraphs 9-10 and 15-13 and DoD 7000.14-R, chapter 8, paragraph 080506.Sample letter for-mats for notification by creditor organizations are provided in chapter 21, AFR 177-104, figure21-5 through figure 21-9 and DoD 7000.14-R, chapter 8, pages 247 through 254.  The authorityfor the involuntary collection of an indebtedness from an Air Force non-appropriated fundemployee is AFI 34-202.16.2.4.3.  The ROS program manager establishes a suspense file for all ROS cases referred to thecreditor organization for completion of due process procedures.  Initial follow-up with the creditororganization is accomplished 45 days after the case is referred and subsequently at 30-day inter-vals until collection action is completed or the ROS case is returned for involuntary collectionaction.  Creditor organizations are required to certify completion of due process procedures beforesubmission to the FSO for involuntary collections.16.2.5.  Collection From States, ANG/AGR Members, and ANG Technicians.  The approving author-ity starts collection action on ANG ROS.  That office advises the senior hose-base commander of eachfinancial charge against an ANG/AGR member or ANG technician.  The notice identifies the perti-nent ROS and establishes a 60-day suspense for collection of the debt (Chapter 22).16.2.5.1.  State Held Liable.  The state adjutant general reimburses the Air Force (Chapter 22).16.2.5.2.  ANG/AGR Member Held Liable. The wing/installation commander informs individualsof their rights and initiates collection action.  The senior host-base commander reports the initia-tion and collection to the approving authority.  Collection procedures are prescribed in paragraph16.2.2.16.2.5.3.  ANG Technician Held Liable.  Procedures in paragraph 16.2.4. apply.16.2.6.  Financial Services Officer (FSO) Actions in Collecting Debts.16.2.6.1.  Collection Procedures for Members.  After the approving authority assesses financialliability, the following procedures apply:16.2.6.1.1.  Members are notified by the ROS program manager (acting on behalf of theapproving authority), and are given 30 days to pay the amount due.  If payment is not arrangedwithin 30 days, the approving authority certifies completion of due process and sends DDForm 362 or DD Form 139 with attachments to the FSO for recording on the individual's payrecord and initiation of involuntary collection action.  Involuntary collections are processedaccording to AFM 177-373, Volume 1, Chapter 53, and other appropriate accounting andfinance directives.16.2.6.1.2.  Members held liable may appeal the findings within 30 days of the date they werenotified of the assessment of financial liability (see Chapter 17).  Upon notification of anappeal submission (or an intent to appeal when the 60 day rule applies to the approving author-ity), the FSO suspends collection of the debt pending the results of the appeal.  If the appeal isgranted, the FSO cancels the debt.  If the appeal is denied, the FSO continues involuntarilycollection of the debt.16.2.6.1.3.  Members held liable for damage to government housing are allowed to requestwaiver of financial liability (Chapter 17).  Upon notification of a waiver request, the FSO sus-pends collection of the debt pending waiver results.  If the liability is partially waived, the FSOcancels the waived portion and continues involuntarily collection of the unwaived portion.64AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 199616.2.6.1.4.  Occasionally, collection is made from a member whose pay record is maintainedby another servicing FSO (paragraph 11.9.).  The supporting document for such a collection isa DD Form 200 signed in block 14g. The FSO processes a DD Form 139, Pay AdjustmentAuthorization, to record the debt on the member's pay record.16.2.6.1.5.  Collection Procedures for Civilian Employees.  After all ROS actions, includingfinal action on ROS appeals, and all due process protections required by AFR 170-30 and DoD7000.14-R are completed; the ROS, with certification of completion of due process attached,is sent to the FSO for recording on the individual's pay record and initiation of involuntary col-lection action.16.2.7.  Collections - Joint and Several Liability.  Each person held liable jointly and severally withothers is liable for the entire amount of the loss or damage.  The total financial liability must equal thetotal dollar loss to the Air Force except in cases where financial liability is limited per paragraph2.3.13.  The approving authority determines the amount to be collected from each individual.16.2.8.  Collection for Government Property Checked as Baggage.  When government propertychecked as personal baggage is lost in transit, send a letter explaining the loss, a copy of the DD Form200, baggage claim check, and other related documents to DFAS for filing a claim with the carrier.16.2.9.  Reciprocal Agreement Between Army and Air Force.  This agreement also is included inparagraph 14-32.f., Army Regulation (AR) 735-5.  The agreement is quoted below.“(1) In processing ROS, a situation occasionally develops where personnel of the Air Force aredetermined to be liable for loss, damage, or destruction of Army property and vice versa.  The Army andthe Air Force have agreed that the action on and routing of the ROS is governed by the regulations of theproperty's owning service without regard to the service assignment (parent service) of the respondent.“(2) When a ROS results in a finding that a member, whose parent service is other than the prop-erty's owing service, should be held liable for the loss, damage, or destruction of the property involved,forward the ROS to the parent service's ROS approving authority with jurisdiction to act on ROS concern-ing the member involved.“(a) The owning service's ROS will contain all evidence gathered as a result of the report,the findings and recommendations of the surveying (Air Force read as investigating instead ofsurveying) officer, and recommendations of the owning service's appropriate ROS approvingauthority.“(b) The parent service approving authority will take action on the findings and recom-mendations according to the parent service's ROS regulations.  Collection will be pursuedunder the parent service regulation.“(c) The parent service approving authority will take action to notify the owning serviceapproving authority of the action taken on the ROS or to reconcile any differences in the antic-ipated action and recommendations of the owning service.” 16.2.10.  Collection From Navy or Marine Corps Members.  When financial liability has beenassessed against Navy or Marine Corps personnel, the following procedures apply:16.2.10.1.  Notify the member in the same manner as for Air Force members. Request lump-sumpayment of the amount due.AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 19966516.2.10.2.  If after 90 days from initial notification, the member fails to pay, either in lump-sum orinstallments, and there is no indication that an appeal was filed within 60 days of notification, sendthe ROS file to the FSO for referral to DFAS for collection assistance.  The file must contain theappropriation to be credited (Treasury receipt account, local operation and maintenance, localfamily housing operation and maintenance, stock or industrial fund), SSN, and the member's lastknown address.16.2.11.  Collection From Separated Members.  If an Air Force member separates before a ROS iscompleted, the following procedures apply:16.2.11.1.  If the member has not been notified of an impending financial liability before his or herseparation, notification must be given in the same manner as for active duty members. The for-warding address can be obtained from the FSO.  If the separated member does not respond to theinitial notification within 42 days, including 12 days mailing time, send the ROS to the approvingauthority for final action.  If the approving authority assesses financial liability, again notify theseparated member of the assessment in the same manner as the active duty members.  If, after 90days from initial notification, collection is not being made or the separated member does notrespond, transfer the case file to the FSO for referral to DFAS for collection assistance.  Includenotification letters in the transferred file.16.2.11.2.  If a member separates after signing block 16g, DD Form 200, but before the approvingauthority assesses financial liability, give notification of the approving authority's assessment inthe same manner as for active duty members (forwarding address can be obtained from the FSO.If, after 90 days from initial notification, the debt is not being collected or the separated memberfails to respond, transfer the case file to the FSO for referral to DFAS for collection assistance.Include notification letters in the transferred file.  FSO notification can also be taken before 90days if the post office returns mail indicating it cannot locate the addressee (see paragraph 1.6.2.).16.2.11.3.  Do not send ROS files to the FSO until the procedures in this paragraph have beenaccomplished unless the debtor cannot be contacted.  If files are transferred to the FSO, they mustcontain the appropriation to be credited, SSN, and the member's last known address.16.2.12.  Collection From Retired Members.  If an Air Force member retires before a ROS is com-pleted, the following procedures apply:16.2.12.1.  If a member has not been notified of an impending financial liability before his or herretirement, accomplish notification and disposition in the same manner as in paragraph 16.2.11.16.2.12.2.  If local collection cannot be made using procedures prescribed in this chapter, the filesare transferred to the FSO for referral to DFAS for offset against the member's retired pay.16.2.12.3.  If a member has acknowledged an impending assessment of financial liability by sign-ing block 16g, DD Form 200, before retirement, notification of the approving authority's assess-ment is accomplished in the same manner as in paragraph 16.2.11.  If local collection cannot bemade, transfer these files for collection to the FSO.16.2.12.4.  Do not send ROS files to the FSO for referral to DFAS for collection until the proce-dures in this paragraph have been accomplished.  If files are transferred to the FSO, they must con-tain, as a minimum, the retiree's social security number and the amount of the debt.  In thetransmittal memorandum, request a treasury check be sent to the FSO maintaining the accounts66AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 1996receivable and cite receipt account 573019.  When the check is received by the FSO, the properaccount is credited (paragraph 16.2.13.).16.2.13.  Accounting for Collections and Receivables.   NOTE:  This paragraph is included for yourinformation.  The procedures listed below are accomplished primarily by DFAS.16.2.13.1.  Credit collections, whether cash or by voucher deduction, to General Fund (Miscella-neous) Receipts, Recoveries for Government Property Lost Or Damaged (573019).  Collectionsfor government property lost, damaged, or destroyed of other DoD components must also cite thisreceipt account.  Collections for damage to family housing are credited to the Family HousingManagement Account.  Collections for damage to unaccompanied personnel housing are creditedto the local O&M appropriation.  Collections for loss or damage to Air Force stock or industrialfund property is credited to the appropriate division of the fund involved.  Collections for loss ordamage to property of a vendor, contractor, or another government that the United States Govern-ment has an obligation to return are credited according to the provisions of the contractor the reg-ulations of the theater of operations implementing the international agreement.16.2.13.2.  Refund receivable records are established by DFAS upon notification from the ROSprogram manager for ROS debts that are credited to accounts other than 573019 when collected.Receivables for uncollectible accounts may be transferred to the DFAS Debt Collection Officeonly after notification and follow-up requirements in paragraph 16.2.11. have been met by thecreditor organization.  The FSO notifies the ROS program manager when the case file is trans-ferred.  Once transferred, no further follow-up action is required by either the FSO or the ROSprogram manager. For debts, where offset is available against a member's retired pay, the DFASretains accountability for related refunds receivable.  DFAS makes offsets and transfers funds col-lected to the DFAS office at the originating base (paragraph 16.2.12.) to liquidate the refundsreceivable.  Close coordination with the ROS program manager is required.16.2.14.  Cases Not Covered By Paragraph 16.2.  In these cases, the program manager should querythe FSO regarding how to address the problem.16.3.  Refunds.16.3.1.  Refund of Erroneous Collections.  If voluntary payment has been made and the missing itemis later located or when the financial liability on a ROS is reduced or canceled and collection has beenmade:16.3.1.1.  The approving authority informs the individual concerned of the adjustment, authorizesrefund of the amount collected, and advises the FSO in writing to process the refund.  The refundvoucher must be supported by references to the collection voucher or military pay order (MPO)number used for the initial collection and a copy of the document containing the reason for therefund.16.3.1.2.  If final action on the ROS was by the intermediate command or major command approv-ing authority, correspondence authorizing repayment is sent to the base of origin.  Attach the cor-respondence to a copy of DD Form 200.16.3.1.3.  In accordance with AFR 177-101, chapter 25, refunds cannot be disbursed directly outof receipt account 573019.  To refund charges collected into receipt account 573019, process anSF 1081, Voucher and Schedule of Withdrawals and Credits, debiting (taking the money outAFMAN23-220   1 JULY 199667of) 573019 and crediting (putting the money into) 57X6875.  Then process an SF 1049, PublicVoucher for Refunds, to refund the money to the member citing 57X6875.16.4.  Members Reassigned.   If a member from whom a collection was made has been transferred fromthe organization originating the charge, all concerned should refer to AFM 177-373, volume I.16.5.  Members Retired.   The approving authority notifies the FSO to prepare the refund documentationif the member's address is known.  The refund voucher must be properly supported by the documentauthorizing the refund.  If the member's address is not known, obtain a current mailing address from theFSO at or from DFAS and notify the FSO accordingly.  Do not transfer the file to DFAS for refund action.16.6.  Losses Discovered After Personnel Leave the Air Force.   While this type of situation shouldnot occur if property records were properly cleared prior to a an officer, NCO, or civilian separating fromthe Air Force, on occasion, they do.  This paragraph applies to persons who separated from the Air Forceand are not receiving any pay from the Air Force.  In these situations, an after the fact ROS should be pro-cessed and an attempt made to obtain reimbursement for the lost, damaged, or destroyed property in thesame manner that a ROS would be processed if the person was still on an Air Force payroll.  In processingthis type of ROS, unit commanders, appointing, and approving authorities should consider taking actionagainst supervisors who might have been negligent in performing their duties.  See paragraph 21.4.68AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 1996Chapter 17  RECONSIDERATIONS, APPEALS, AND WAIVERS17.1.  General.   After action has been taken by the approving authority on a determination of liabilityunder the provisions of this manual, a ROS is not reopened, corrected, or altered in any manner except asprovided in this chapter.17.2.  Requests for Reconsideration.   The approving authority who took action on the ROS may con-sider requests for reconsideration.  Such action may consist of:17.2.1.  Minor Corrections.  Minor corrections, which do not involve important changes in findings orrecommendations of investigating officials or in the action of appointing or approving authorities, canusually be made by the program manager who has the original ROS on file.  Corresponding correc-tions should be made on all other copies.17.2.2.  Cancellation.  Cancellation of a finalized ROS that was used to adjust property control recordsis seldom necessary or desirable; however, the approving authority who took action may cancel theoriginal ROS if circumstances warrant, such as duplicate ROS; discovery of items previously reportedas lost; and a ROS erroneously initiated to cover property belonging to activities other than the AirForce.  The approving authority canceling a ROS notifies each activity on distribution and ensuresthat any adjustment action taken is reversed.  Canceled and regular ROS are kept for six years as pre-scribed in paragraph 11.6.17.2.3.  New Evidence.  If new evidence or information becomes available, the approving authority orhigher headquarters may reopen a ROS.  Amending action may be taken with or without reinvestiga-tion; however, the approving authority may direct the investigating officer or may appoint a financialliability officer to make whatever additional investigation has been directed or is appropriate.  Uponcompletion of the additional investigation, the ROS is resubmitted through original channels to theapproving authority taking previous action.  If the approving authority taking the previous actiondetermines that further investigation by an investigating or financial liability officer is not necessary,additional corrective action may be indicated on the ROS immediately or, if desired, after additionalinformation or evidence has been evaluated.  Notice of corrective action on a ROS must be communi-cated through proper channels to all offices having copies.17.2.4.  Property Recovered Is Damaged.  When property believed to be lost and dropped from prop-erty records by an approved ROS is later found but is damaged, the original ROS will be canceled anda new ROS initiated to:17.2.4.1.  Establish responsibility for the damage.17.2.4.2.  Establish financial liability, if warranted.17.2.4.3.  Establish monetary loss or cost of repair.17.2.4.4.  Dispose of unserviceable property.17.3.  Appeals.   A person held financially liable may appeal the findings of a ROS.AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 19966917.3.1.  The appeal must be submitted in writing, and specifically state the alleged errors or injusticesoccurring during the survey process.  A member may seek legal assistance in preparing an appeal.  (Arequest for reconsideration based on new evidence is processed in accordance with paragraph 17.2.3.and is not considered an appeal.)17.3.2.  Appeals must be submitted to the approving authority within 30 days of the date the individ-ual charged is originally notified of the assessed liability; however, in cases where assessed financialliability exceeds one month's basic pay, the written intent to appeal must be submitted to the approv-ing authority within 30 days and the appeal must be submitted within 60 days.17.4.  Debt Collection Actions.17.4.1.  If an individual submits an appeal, the ROS program manager notifies the individual's servic-ing FSO to suspend collection of the debt.17.4.2.  If an individual is scheduled for impending separation or resignation before an appeal can beruled on, collection of the debt will be made; however, if the appeal is approved, the person(s) will bereimbursed.17.5.  ROS Appeal Procedures When the Approving Authority is in an Organization Below MAJ-COM Level.17.5.1.  If the wing/installation approving authority grants the appeal, it is returned to the ROS pro-gram manager who annotates the survey register, notifies the individual, and the individual's servicingFSO of the successful appeal.  The FSO cancels the indebtedness on the individual's pay account.  Ifcollection was already made, the amount collected is refunded to the individual in the same manner asfor erroneous collections.  No further action is required on the appeal.17.5.2.  If the wing/installation approving authority denies the appeal, either in whole or in part, theprogram manager notifies the individual and sends the complete file to the next higher commanderwho takes action as outlined in Chapter 12.17.5.3.  If the next higher commander approves the appeal, it is returned to originating wing/installa-tion for closure action; however, if the appeal is denied, the next higher commander forwards it to theMAJCOM commander who takes final action "By Authority of the Secretary of the Air Force."  Thisparagraph assumes that there is only one "next higher commander" between the wing and the MAJ-COM.If there are more than one, then the ROS is forwarded through command channels. All intermediatecommands must be advised of actions taken by higher headquarters so that their suspense files may becleared.17.5.4.  Any commander acting on a ROS appeal may exercise the discretionary options addressed inparagraph 8.6.17.6.  Preparation of ROS Files for Forwarding.17.6.1.  The appeal file sent by the wing/installation approving authority will contain the followingpapers in duplicate:17.6.1.1.  A transmittal letter with the following attachments:70AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 199617.6.1.1.1.  The appeal.17.6.1.1.2.  DD Form 200, Financial Liability Investigation of Property Loss, and support-ing documents, if any.17.6.1.1.3.  A statement indicating the reasons for denying the appeal.17.6.1.1.4.  A STATEMENT WHICH RESPONDS TO EACH CONTENTION ORALLEGATION RAISED BY THE APPELLANT.17.6.1.1.5.  A statement of whether or not damaged property will be repaired.  (This is neededonly when liability is based on estimated repair costs and the damaged property has not beenrepaired.)17.6.1.1.6.  Appellant's mailing address.17.6.1.1.7.  Any additional information that would assist the next higher commander in rulingon the appeal.17.6.1.1.8.  A statement of whether or not an amount was already collected from an appellantand collection and, or payroll deduction voucher number, if applicable.17.7.  MAJCOM Actions and Appeals From Subordinate Headquarters.17.7.1.  If the MAJCOM commander grants the appeal, the file is returned directly to the originatingwing/installation commander for processing action by the program manger; however, the MAJCOMwill advise the intermediate headquarters of this action so that their suspense files can be closed.17.7.2.  If  the MAJCOM denies the appeal, either in whole or in part, the file is returned directly tothe originating wing/installation commander, who notifies the individual and pursues collection viathe individual's FSO.  The MAJCOM's appeal action is final and no further appeal may be considered.It is taken "By Authority of The Secretary of the Air Force."17.7.3.  Actions on ROS Appeals Originating at MAJCOM level.  If the MAJCOM commander is theapproving authority and the appeal is denied, the MAJCOM commander sends the appeal to HQUSAF/LGS, who takes final action "By Authority of the Secretary of the Air Force".  The transmittalconsists of the same documents as prescribed in paragraph 17.6. above.17.8.  Housing Damage Waivers.   Approving authorities may waive all or part of the assessed liabilityfor damage to government accommodations based on the circumstances in the case.  Details are outlinedin Chapter 19.AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 199671Chapter 18  ROS PERTAINING TO VEHICLES18.1.  General.   This chapter provides guidance relating to damage to private conveyances, rental vehi-cles, and government owned vehicles.  For the purposes of this manual, a vehicle is considered to be anypiece of equipment that moves on a solid surface either under its own power, towed, or pushed and is usedto move people or things.  A vehicle can be mounted on wheels, tracked treads, or runners and be of com-mercial or military design.  The following are examples of vehicles;  however, it is not an all inclusive list:sedans; pick-up and cargo trucks; prime movers; trailers; motorcycles; tracked vehicles; manual or motoroperated cranes; snow mobiles; aircraft cargo loaders; hand operated or mechanized warehouse materialhandling equipment, such as warehouse tractors and trailers, forklift trucks, cranes, stackers which may bemanually or computer controlled, and any other type of mechanized materials handling item.  This listcompliments the definitions of a vehicle in Joint Publication 1-02, DOD Dictionary of Military and Asso-ciated Terms, and Webster's Dictionary.18.2.  Damage Involving Private Conveyances.   Damage to Air Force property resulting from opera-tion of privately owned vehicles, boats, airplanes, or other conveyances is not generally subject to theROS process.  Claims, or administrative action against responsible individuals are usually pursued underAFI 51-501 (Tort Claims) and other regulations.  If Air Force members or employees are involved, a ROSmay be processed instead of asserting a tort claim for the damage to Air Force property. These actionsmust be coordinated with the legal office.18.3.  Damage to Rental Vehicles.18.3.1.  A ROS is initiated in accordance with paragraph 18.4. for damage to General ServicesAdministration (GSA) vehicles and commercial rental vehicles under Air Force control.  (Commercialrental vehicles are under Air Force control when an Air Force contracting officer enters into a writtenagreement with a commercial rental vehicle company to make vehicles available for government use.)18.3.2.  Damage to vehicles rented by members and employees directly from commercial companiesis not subject to the provisions of this manual, regardless of whether or not the rental was authorizedon government orders.18.4.  ROS  Guidance and Procedures for Government Vehicles.18.4.1.  General.18.4.1.1.  When to Process a Vehicle ROS.  Paragraph 18.4. provides guidance on when a ROS isprocessed and when financial liability can be imposed on Air Force members and employees incases involving the loss, damage or destruction of government vehicles.  More significantly, incases involving government vehicles, the standard used for processing ROS and imposing finan-cial liability is gross negligence, willful misconduct, or deliberate unauthorized use.18.4.1.2.  Rationale for the "Gross Negligence" Guidance.  The "gross negligence" criterion hasbeen adopted to eliminate the significant expenditure of resources to process reports of survey forlittle monetary return to the Government, and to more equitably distribute the risk of liability asso-ciated with government vehicle damage. Past practices had resulted in unfairly charging the vehi-72AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 1996cle operators (normally the most junior airmen and civilian employees) for motor vehicle damage,which is commonly recognized as a normal cost of doing business.  However, the gross negligencestandard does not preclude a commander from taking other administrative or disciplinary actionsagainst individuals who damage government vehicles.  See paragraph 18.4.2.3.18.4.2.  Overall Guidance.18.4.2.1.  When a Vehicle ROS Is Required.  A ROS must be processed in all loss, damage, ordestruction cases if there is evidence of gross negligence, willful misconduct, deliberate unautho-rized use, or if property records must be adjusted.18.4.2.2.  Assigning Financial Liability.  Air Force members and employees can be held finan-cially liable only in those cases in which the loss or damage to government motor vehicles wasproximately caused by the member's or employee's gross negligence, willful misconduct, or delib-erate unauthorized use.18.4.2.3.  Punishments and Administrative Actions.  The fact that a ROS was not processed orfinancial liability was not imposed on the person responsible for the vehicle damage does not pre-vent the commander from taking other action against the responsible person.  These actionsinclude, but are not limited to, punitive action under the UCMJ, disciplinary action under AFI36-704, (Discipline and Adverse Actions), verbal or  written reprimands, verbal or written coun-seling, remarks in performance evaluations, non-judicial punishment under Article 15 of theUCMJ, or other appropriate administrative action.18.4.3.  Implementing Instructions.18.4.3.1.  Appointing Investigating Officers.  When a vehicle  is lost, damaged, or destroyed, the"approving or  appointing authority" or the commander of the organization that has possession ofthe vehicle will appoint an investigating officer who will ascertain the facts in the case and makea recommendation to the "approving or appointing authority" on whether or not processing a ROSis required.  This also applies to vehicles that may be deployed or issued on hand receipt to indi-viduals outside of the owning organization.  General procedures for processing a ROS are con-tained in Chapter 4.  Investigating officer duties are described in Chapter 7.  Time frames forprocessing a ROS are addressed in Chapter 5.18.4.3.2.  Requirement for Impartial Investigating Officers.  Generally, the squadron vehiclecontrol officer or vehicle control NCO cannot be appointed as investigating officers because,in most cases involving damaged vehicles, these individuals do not meet the "disinterested"or "impartial" requirement necessary for investigating officers.  See paragraph 7.1.2.18.4.3.3.  Vehicle Accident Reports.  A motor vehicle accident investigation report prepared bysecurity police personnel, civilian law enforcement authorities, or transportation/vehicle controlofficers may be used by the investigating officer to determine whether there is evidence of grossnegligence, willful misconduct, or deliberate unauthorized use.  The accident investigation reportcan be used for this purpose only if it thoroughly documents the facts and circumstances of thedamage.18.4.3.4.  Other Accident Investigations.  If an accident investigation report was not accom-plished, has insufficient information, or leaves doubt that all facts have been presented, then theinvestigating officer must conduct an investigation to determine all facts and circumstances of thedamage.AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 19967318.4.3.5.  Investigating Officer's Recommendations.   After reviewing the facts and circumstancesof the damage, the investigating officer must make a written recommendation to the  "approvingor the appointing authority" as to whether or not a ROS is required.  The investigating officer willprovide a copy to the ROS program manager.  After considering the investigating officer's recom-mendation, the "approving or the appointing authority" makes the final decision on whether or nota ROS will be processed.  The ROS program manager will be advised of this decision.18.4.3.5.1.  Recommendation Not to Process a ROS.  If the facts and circumstances clearlyindicate the absence of gross negligence, willful misconduct or deliberate unauthorized use,the investigating officer makes a written recommendation to the "approving or the appointingauthority" that a ROS is not required and no financial liability should be imposed; however, ifproperty records must be adjusted, a ROS must be processed.  The investigating officer pro-vides a copy of the recommendation to the ROS program manager.18.4.3.5.2.  Recommendation that a ROS Be Processed.  If the facts and circumstances indi-cate the presence of gross negligence, willful misconduct or deliberate unauthorized use, or ifproperty records must be adjusted, the investigating officer makes a recommendation to the"approving or the appointing authority" that a ROS is required and should be processed.  Theinvestigating officer provides a copy of this recommendation to the ROS program manager.18.4.3.6.  Withdrawing O&M Funds.  Whether or not a ROS is processed under the procedures setforth in Chapter 4, wing or installation commanders should consider withdrawing operation andmaintenance (O&M) funds from the unit to which the responsible individual is assigned and trans-ferring these funds to the organization that must repair the damage.  See paragraph 2.3.5., Penal-izing Units Whose Members Abuse Property.18.4.3.7.  Unit Reviews of Accident Records and Program Managers' Trend Data.  This sub-para-graph requires action by commanders or approving authorities, organizations which have acci-dents, and program managers. It has two purposes.18.4.3.7.1.  The first is to ensure that commanders of units involved in accidents review theirloss, damage, or destruction data so that corrective action may be taken to prevent recurrences,to ensure a ROS is processed when required, and cases are reviewed to determine if disciplin-ary or administrative action should be taken against the individuals involved in the accidents.18.4.3.7.2.  The second is to enable the ROS program manager to develop trend data whichcan be presented to the commander or the approving authority.  To gather this information, theprogram manager will make an entry on the  AF Form 453 indicating that an accidentoccurred.  It also will provide a reason why a ROS was not processed.  It is a base or MAJ-COM responsibility to prescribe the type of information that will satisfy the trend data require-ment.74AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 1996Chapter 19  ROS PERTAINING TO GOVERNMENT HOUSING19.1.  General.   Paragraph 0707 of the DoDR cited in paragraph 1.2.2. of this manual outlines DoD pol-icy pertaining to government housing liability.  Some portions of paragraph 0707 are included in thischapter that prescribes the liability of military personnel for the loss, damage, or destruction of govern-ment housing (family housing or unaccompanied personnel housing).  It also describes minimum require-ments for assessing financial liability when government housing, including equipment or furnishingstherein, is lost, damaged or destroyed.  Government housing within the scope of this chapter includes bothpermanent and temporary quarters either owned by, or controlled by, the U.S. Government.19.2.  Determination of Proximate Cause.   A member of a Military Service shall be held liable to theUnited States for the loss, damage or destruction of family housing or an unaccompanied personnel hous-ing unit assigned to a member, including equipment and furnishings therein, when a determination ismade that the loss, damage or destruction was proximately caused by the abuse or negligence of the mem-ber, a dependent of the member, or a guest either of the member or the member's dependent.19.3.  Financial Liability of Occupants.   Financial liability against personnel for loss, damage ordestruction of government housing, including equipment and furnishings is assessed for the full amountof the loss if the loss, damage or destruction was proximately caused by gross negligence or abuse.  Lia-bility of occupants for damage to government housing and related equipment and furnishings is pre-scribed in 10 U.S.C. Section 2775 and DoD 4165.63-M.19.4.  Determination of Negligence.   Determinations must be made on whether the loss or damage togovernment housing was proximately caused by simple or gross negligence or abuse of the member, themember's dependents, or guests of either.19.4.1.  When the proximate cause of the loss or damage is determined to be gross negligence orabuse, the financial liability of the member is for the total amount of the loss to the government.Where a member's dependent or guest causes a loss or damage through gross negligence or abuse, themember is fully liable for the loss or damage if the member was "on notice" of the particular riskinvolved and failed to exercise reasonable, available opportunities to prevent or limit the loss or dam-age.In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the member is presumed to have been "on notice" ofany risks attending the activities of family members and guest(s) on the premises.19.4.2.  Where simple negligence is determined to be the proximate cause of the loss or damage, thefinancial liability of the member is limited to an amount equal to basic pay for one month at the rate ineffect at the time of the loss, or the amount of the loss, whichever is less.19.4.3.  A member is liable for damages to or failure to satisfactorily clean any assigned family hous-ing or unaccompanied personnel housing unit (including loss or damage to equipment and furnishingstherein) if a ROS determines that the loss or damage was caused by the member's negligence or delib-erate unauthorized use of such unit.19.4.4.  ROS on members who damage nonassigned quarters are subject to the guidance contained inparagraphs 19.1. through 19.3.  If both assigned and nonassigned quarters are damaged in the sameAFMAN23-220   1 JULY 199675incident, a member may be held liable for damage to assigned quarters, and may also be held liable fordamage to nonassigned quarters up to one month's basic pay.  Under these circumstances, total liabil-ity for all quarters damaged in a single incident may not exceed one month's basic pay, unless grossnegligence or willful misconduct is involved.19.4.5.  If assigned quarters and personal or organizational equipment are damaged in the same inci-dent, a member may be held liable for quarters damage and may also be held liable for damage to thepersonal or organizational equipment.19.5.  Responsibility for Submitting a ROS.   The civil engineer (CE) is responsible for preparing aROS applicable to housing damage because the CE is both the custodian and the accountable officer forthe housing and the contents.  This is different from the normal equipment item that is on the accountablerecords of one person but another organization or person in that organization has custodial responsibilityfor the item.  For these items the unit commander (custodian) prepares the ROS.19.6.  Waiver Provisions - Housing Damage.   10 U.S.C. Section 2775 provides for waiver of liabilityarising under conditions in paragraphs 19.1.  through 19.3. The waiver applies to both family housing andunaccompanied personnel housing.  The Secretary of the Air Force may waive an uncollected claim of theUnited States if he or his designee, based upon the unique circumstances of an individual case, determinesthat the waiver of the claim is in the best interests of the United States. This authority is delegated to theROS approving and appellate authorities.  Detailed procedures follow.19.7.  Waiver Consideration for Housing Damage.   Liability resulting from damage to assigned fam-ily housing or unaccompanied housing (including equipment and furnishings therein) is subject to waiverby the ROS approving authority.  Liability may be waived, in whole or in part, by the approving authorityif, based upon the unique circumstances of an individual case, it is determined that the waiver is in thebest interest of the Untied States.19.7.1.  Factors To Be Considered.  In determining whether or not liability should be waived by theapproving authority, factors to be considered may include, but are not limited to the following:19.7.1.1.  Degree of abuse or negligence involved.19.7.1.2.  Where damage was caused by a dependent or guest, whether or not the member or themember's spouse was on notice of the activities in question and exercised available opportunitiesfor preventing or limiting the damage, or otherwise exercised proper control over dependents orguests.19.7.1.3.  The extent, if any, to which involuntary collection would cause substantial financialhardship, constitute a clear injustice, or adversely impact unit morale and discipline.19.7.1.4.  Available government remedies against other culpable persons, and the relative culpa-bility of all persons whose actions or omissions contributed to the damage or loss.19.7.1.5.  Any prior instances of abusive or negligent conduct toward government property.19.7.1.6.  In overseas areas, the unavailability of private insurance to cover the liability of individ-uals who would normally be insurable in the United States.76AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 199619.7.2.  Waiver Procedures.  A member may specifically request a waiver and provide support for therequest in writing.  In the absence of such a request, the approving authority still considers the appro-priateness of granting a waiver based on the information in the ROS.19.7.2.1.  Individual Charged.  Once a member has been notified that charges are being consideredfor damage to government housing, he or she is advised of certain options available.  One of theseoptions is to submit a fully substantiated waiver request to the approving authority.  If the memberelects to request waiver, it is submitted to the ROS program manager at the same time the DDForm 200 (with block 16 completed) is returned to the program manager.19.7.2.2.  If waiver request is received along with the DD Form 200 (with block 16 completed),the program manager sends the waiver and the DD Form 200 through the appointing authority tothe approving authority.19.7.2.3.  The appointing authority takes no action on the waiver, sending the waiver request to theapproving authority with the DD Form 200 (after completing block 13).  While the appointingauthority has no active role in waiver determinations, he or she may direct that corrections bemade if policies and procedures relating to waivershave not been adhered to.19.7.2.4.  Approving Authority.  If the approving authority has assessed financial liability, he orshe immediately decides whether or not to waiver that liability by considering the factors in Chap-ter 17.  A wavier is considered regardless of whether or not a member specifically requests awaiver.  If the approving authority waives the liability in full, disposition is the same as for reliefof liability.  The program manager advises member and the FSO that the debt is canceled.  If theapproving authority does not waive the liability in full, the member is so notified and is advised ofwhat further options for relief are available.19.7.2.5.  Upon receipt of an adverse waiver determination, a member may appeal the determina-tion of liability under procedures in paragraph 17.3., or request further waiver consideration by theMAJCOM commander.  These options must be exercised within 30 days of the date the member isnotified of the assessment of liability.  The options must be elected concurrently, and not sequen-tially, within 30 days, and the election may not be changed except to withdraw an option.  If eitheror both options are elected, the following procedures apply:19.7.2.5.1.  If a member appeals a determination of liability under procedures in paragraph17.3., and also requests further waiver consideration by the MAJCOM commander, the twoactions are considered concurrently.  The approving authority considers the appeal of theassessment of liability.  If the appeal is denied, the entire appeal and waiver package is sent tothe MAJCOM commander for final action on the appeal and the waiver.  The MAJCOM com-mander first considers the appeal, and, if denied, immediately considers the waiver.19.7.2.5.2.  If a member elects to submit an appeal only, procedures in paragraph 17.3. apply.19.7.2.5.3.  If a member elects to only request a waiver, the approving authority reviews theROS file.  If the waiver request is disapproved, the case is sent to the next higher headquartersfor action on the waiver.  The waiver package consists of the same documentation as in para-graph 17.3. substituting "waiver" for "appeal."19.7.2.6.  If the MAJCOM commander waives the liability in full, the file is returned to the wingapproving authority for action by the ROS program manager who annotates the survey registerand notifies the individual and the individual's servicing FSO of the waiver.  The FSO cancels theAFMAN23-220   1 JULY 199677outstanding indebtedness on the individual's pay account.  Because the waiver authority onlyrelates to outstanding claims of the United States, any amount of a housing damage debt collectedbefore the waiver is requested may not be refunded.19.7.2.7.  If the MAJCOM commander does not waive the liability in full, the file is returned to thebase for action by the ROS program manager, who notifies the individual and pursues collectionvia the individual's servicing FSO.  If part of the liability is waived, the FSO reduces the debt andcollects the remaining amount.19.7.2.8.  Waiver determinations made by the MAJCOM commander are final.19.7.2.8.1.  If liability is not waived in full by the MAJCOM commander, an enlisted membermay request remission by HQ USAF/LGS, using the Air Force procedures and criteria estab-lished under 10 U.S.C. Section 9837.19.7.2.8.2.  Officers may request waiver consideration by the Secretary of the Air Force underthe authority of 10 U.S.C. Section 2775, but the procedures and criteria used in consideringsuch a waiver are those established by the Air Force under 10 U.S.C. Section 9837.  That is,enlisted and officers both use remission channels rather than ROS channels to obtain consider-ation by the Secretary of the Air Force.  AFM 177-373, volume I, applies.19.7.2.9.  In cases where the MAJCOM commander is the approving authority on the ROS and thewaiver is denied, the MAJCOM commander sends the waiver request to HQ USAF/LGS for con-sideration.  HQ USAF/LGS follows procedures that are similar to those for the MAJCOM com-mander.19.8.  Action and Processing of Housing Liability Waivers.19.8.1.  Waiver requests can be processed through channels from the wing/installation commander tothe next higher commander.  In these cases the next higher commander takes one of two actions.19.8.1.1.  Takes final action disapproving the waiver request "By Authority of the Secretary of theAir Force," if the MAJCOM has authorized this by written delegation of authority.19.8.1.2.  Forwards the waiver request to the next higher commander, probably the MAJCOM, foraction if the commander above wing level has not been given disapproval authority.19.8.2.  MAJCOM Actions.19.8.2.1.  The MAJCOM commander takes final disapproval action "By Authority of the Secre-tary of the Air Force" on waiver requests where liability was not waived by lower-level organiza-tions.19.8.2.2.  If the MAJCOM commander was the approving authority on the ROS for which awaiver request was submitted, and does not waive the liability, sends the waiver request to HQUSAF/LGS for final action.19.8.2.3.  USAF/LGS takes final action "By Authority of the Secretary of the Air Force" onwaiver requests where liability is not waived by the MAJCOM commander.78AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 1996Chapter 20  SUPPLY SYSTEM AND PETROLEUM STOCKS20.1.  General.   This chapter applies to Air Force property defined as "supply system stocks" and con-tains procedures to be followed when discrepancies are discovered. Retail bulk petroleum stocks also areaddressed.  Supply system stocks are those inventories where a stock record account is required to bemaintained, showing by item the receipt, issue, and disposal of property, the balances on hand, and suchother identifying or stock control data as may be required.  This includes in-stores wholesale and retailinventories financed by stock funds and other appropriations for issue to end-use customers.  Wholesalestocks are the responsibility of Defense Logistics Agency (DLA).20.2.  Guidance.   Accountable officers for supply system stocks are liable for the full amount of the loss,damage, or destruction of property for which they are accountable when the loss, damage, or destructionis proximately caused by their negligence, willful misconduct, or deliberate unauthorized use.  Liabilityfor the full amount is addressed in paragraph C.4.6. of the DoD directive cited in paragraph 1.2. 20.3.  DoD Supply System Stocks Procedures.   The following is an extract of the DoD Regulationcited in paragraph 1.2.2. as it pertains to supply system stocks and is provided for guidance.“0708 SUPPLY SYSTEM MATERIEL“070801.  Purpose.  This section applies to personal property defined as "supply systemmateriel" and contains procedures to be followed when inventory losses are discovered.  Theprovisions of this chapter are applicable to all activities accountable for supply system mate-riel including stock fund and other inventories (e.g., appropriated fund, industrial fund, etc.).“070802.  Inventory.  Physical inventories shall be taken in accordance with the provisionscontained in this Regulation and DoD Instruction 4140.35 "Physical Inventory Control forDoD Supply System Material."“A.  Discrepancies.  Despite the safeguards established by DoD Components in thecare and maintenance of supply system stocks, discrepancies may occur between stockrecord balances and materiel in storage.  These discrepancies are subject to postcount val-idation, preadjustment research, and causative research, as prescribed in chapter 7 of DoD4000.25-2-M, "Military Standard Transaction Reporting and Accounting Procedures(MILSTRAP)."“B.  Adjustments.  An adjustment shall be made to the inventory and financial recordsto bring those records into balance after appropriate research. Care should be taken to pro-cess the transactions correctly (e.g., an issue posted twice should be corrected by a reversal(credit transaction), not as a loss of inventory).  These types of corrected discrepancies arereferred to as resolved discrepancies. For unresolved inventory losses, an inventory adjust-ment document or a DD Form 200 shall be used to substantiate adjusting the inventory andaccounting records to the stock on hand and to provide relief from property accountabilityor responsibility.AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 199679“C.  Causative Research“1.  Causative research shall be conducted for all inventory discrepancies that meetany of the criteria specified in DoD 4000.25-2-M, "Military Standard TransactionReporting and Accounting Procedures (MILSTRAP)."  For inventory discrepancieswhich do not meet the criteria for performing causative research, a justification foradjusting the inventory and accounting records and relief from property accountabilityshall be provided by means of an inventory adjustment document in accordance withsection D. below.“2.  One of the purposes of this research is to either establish liability or providerelief from accountability for the accountable and/or responsible officer(s) for the loss,damage or destruction of supply system materiel.“3.  Another purpose of the research is to determine if the loss to the governmentwas proximately caused by the negligence or abuse of individuals.  If an individualaccepts responsibility for the loss, damage or destruction of supply system materiel andvoluntarily reimburses the government, a DD Form 200 is not required.  The collectionvoucher may be used to adjust the financial and property records.“D.  DD Form 200 Used in Substantiating Inventory Loss Adjustments.  When autho-rized, the reviewing authority may approve physical inventory adjustments equal to or lessthan $50,000, when negligence or abuse is not evident or suspected.  When negligence orabuse is evident or suspected, the reviewing authority initiates and forwards the DD Form200 to the appointing authority for action. The financial liability investigation shall be usedto substantiate adjusting the stock record, and providing relief from property accountabil-ity.“070803.  Resolved Inventory Losses“A.    Accountability.    The  data  developed  by  postcount  validation,  preadjustmentresearch, and causative research shall be utilized to prepare correcting documentation sothat the inventory accounting systems may be updated.  These adjustments shall be pro-cessed in accordance with this Regulation and DoD 4000.25-2-M.“B.  Statistics.  This type of data shall be classified in accordance with chapter 7 ofDoD 4000.25-2-M and the data accumulated to identify trends and problem areas.“070804.

A financial liability investigation shall beinitiated on all unresolved inventory discrepancies for each stock number that meets any of thefollowing criteria:“A.  Gains and losses of sensitive items (e.g., drugs, precious metals, hazardous mate-riel, small arms, ammunition, explosives), regardless of dollar value.“B.  Gains and losses of classified items, regardless of dollar value.“C.  Gains and losses of pilferable items when the unit price times the quantity is equalto or greater than $2,500.00 for each stock number.“D.  Any inventory loss when there is an indication or suspicion of fraud, theft or neg-ligence.“E.  Repetitive losses when the cumulative dollar value of the inventory losses equalsor exceeds the projected cost of the financial liability investigation.“F.  Bulk petroleum when the loss exceeds the stated allowance.             “070808.  Procedures for an Investigation“A.  Accountability and Responsibility.  For unresolved inventory losses which meetthe criteria set forth in paragraphs 070806 and 070807, above, a DD Form 200 is requiredto relieve accountable or responsible officers from responsibility, to substantiate adjust-ment of the inventory and accounting records to the inventory on hand, and to identifyproblem areas or trends for corrective actions. A financial liability investigation should beconducted by a person who is not directly supervised by the accountable or responsibleofficer.  It shall include, as a minimum, the following actions:“1.  Review and evaluate existing procedures for their adequacy in protecting prop-erty.“2.  Determine compliance with prescribed regulations and procedures.“3.  Determine who is involved and what responsibilities they have been assigned.“4.  Determine whether negligence or abuse is evident.AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 199681 “5.  Review of causative research conducted.“6.  Determine the cause or the probable cause of the inventory loss.“7.  Recommend actions to minimize recurrence of the inventory loss. “B.  Review the Adequacy of Procedures in Protecting Property.“1.    Physical  Security  Review.    Determine  if  storage  facilities  are  adequate  toensure proper safeguarding of all items, especially those items that are sensitive, clas-sified, or subject to pilferage.  The review should include an evaluation of compliancewith regulatory requirements, procedures to determine degree of susceptibility of itemsto theft or pilferage, and lessons to be learned from losses that have been experienced.“2.  Receipt, Storage, and  Shipment  Procedures  Review.  Determine  if  adequateprocedures exist to prevent loss from theft or pilferage during receipt, storage, or ship-ment.  The degree of protection should be commensurate with statutory and regulatoryrequirements, the degree of susceptibility to theft or pilferage, and experienced losses.“C.  Determine Procedural Compliance.  Determine if the responsible persons havecomplied with existing procedures to protect Government property.  If they have not com-plied with the procedures, determine if they failed to comply or were instructed not tocomply.”20.4.  Air Force Procedures Implementing DoD Policy.20.4.1.  Discrepancies in supply system stocks may occur between stock record account balances andmateriel in storage.  DLA will investigate these discrepancies to determine the reason for theout-of-balance condition.  If the initial investigation reveals that the discrepancy is the result of apaperwork or posting error, make an accounting adjustment to bring the appropriate records into bal-ance.  Accounting adjustments are prescribed in AFI 33-112.20.4.2.  If the initial investigation does not identify the cause of the discrepancy and if the discrepancydoes not meet the requirements for a mandatory ROS (Chapter 3), use an inventory adjustment doc-ument to adjust the stock record account.20.4.3.  If the initial investigation does not identify the cause of the discrepancy and the discrepancymeets the requirement for a ROS, a further investigation must be conducted by disinterested personaddressed in Chapter 7.  Document the results of the investigation on DD Form 200, Financial Lia-bility Investigation of Property Loss. Use the ROS to substantiate adjustment of the stock recordaccount, to recommend corrective action, and to determine the financial responsibility of the account-able officer or any other person involved in the discrepancy.  The suspense copy of DD Form 200 canbe used to adjust the inventory control record pending receipt of the approved DD Form 200.20.4.4.  As a minimum, the investigation will cover the requirements listed in the DoD paragraph070808 contained in paragraph 20.3.20.5.  Corrective Action Statement.   In cases where the investigation determines any type of deficiencyin the control of or accounting for property, a statement must be made in block 10, DD Form 200, on theaction taken to prevent recurrence of the discrepancy.82AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 199620.6.  Accountable Officer Signature.   DD Form 200, block 17e, Accountable Officer, must be signedby the local inventory manager having accountability for supply system stocks (for example, chief of sup-ply, base fuels management officer, medical supply officer, etc.).20.7.  Reviewing Authority Signature.   For supply system stocks, DD Form 200, block 12f, must besigned by the reviewing authority.20.8.  Retail Bulk Petroleum Losses.20.8.1.  Except for minor changes, the following is extracted from paragraph 0709, "Petroleum Prod-uct/Losses" contained in DoD Reference cited in paragraph 1.2.2.20.8.1.1.  Loss Expectancy.  Some losses are unavoidable in the handling and storage of volatileproducts.  These losses can be controlled by management actions to limit the rates of loss for suchproducts so that standards are not exceeded.  For this reason, volume II, chapter 10, of DoD4140.25-M, Management of Bulk Petroleum Products, Storage and Distribution Facilities, pro-vides authorized loss allowances to accommodate product losses normally expected.  Categoriesof losses are defined in volume II, chapter 11, of DoD 4140.25-M.20.8.1.2.  Any trends, such as a pattern of losses within the allowable percentage, require furtherresearch and investigation.  These losses shall be researched and reported in accordance with sec-tion 0708 of the DoD procedure.AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 199683Chapter 21  ROS PERTAINING TO PROPERTY RECORD ITEMS21.1.  General.   This chapter applies to Air Force property defined as "property record items" and con-tains procedures to be followed when discrepancies are found.Property record items includes all Air Forceaccountable property other than supply system stocks, which are addressed in Chapter 20.  Definitions ofproperty record items are in paragraph 21.3.  Property record items are not mentioned by DoD in the ref-erences cited in paragraph 1.2.21.2.  Guidance.   A ROS is normally required for property record items lost, damaged, or destroyed.There are situations when a ROS is mandatory and other situations when one is not prepared.  See Chap-ter 3 that outlines when a ROS is or is not required.21.3.  Definition of Property Record Items.   This category of property includes the following DoDdefinitions:21.3.1.  Military Real Property.  Lands, buildings, structures, utilities systems, and improvements andappurtenances thereto.  It includes equipment attached to and made part of buildings and structures(such as plant equipment).  Also, it includes installed equipment, such as fixed overhead crane run-ways, elevators, lavatories, plumbing, and electrical systems.  Machine tools and production equip-ment are not included under this category.21.3.2.  Military Personal Property.  Accountable property of any kind except real property as definedabove, supply system stocks, and tools used or capable of use in the manufacture of supplies or in theperformance of services or for any administrative or general plant purposed.21.3.3.

Property of a capital nature (consisting of machinery, equipment, furniture,vehicles, machine tools, accessory and auxiliary items, but excluding special tooling), and used orcapable of use in the manufacture of supplies, or in the performance of services, or for any administra-tive, or general plant purposes.21.3.6.  Excess, Surplus, and Foreign Excess Personal Property.  Personal property on which disposalaction has been initiated by the DoD component.  It may have come from supply system inventoriesor from equipment in use.  In either case, accountability is dropped at the time of transfer from theowning agency to the property disposal agency.21.3.7.  Government Furnished Property (GFM).  GFM is described in the Federal Acquisition Regu-lation (FAR), part 45.  Examples of such equipment are aircraft engines, electronic systems, and otherparts that are furnished to a contractor by contracting offices for incorporation into an airplane, ship,84AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 1996or other weapon system. The contracting officer to whom the contractor is assigned is responsible forcomplying with the applicable provisions of the FAR.21.4.   Losses Resulting From Non-Compliance With Account Transfer Procedures Upon Change ofCustodians.21.4.1.  AFMAN 67-1 (AFMAN 23-110), Volume II, prescribes procedures to follow when propertycustodians are changed.  They require that a joint inventory be conducted by the old and the new cus-todian, that any missing items be recorded, that a copy of the property record balance signed by thenew custodian be provided to the old custodian, and that in cases of a PCS, the clearance record of theoutgoing custodian be initialed to indicate the custodian's account is clear and that the custodian cancomply with the PCS orders.21.4.2.  If the custodial records are not in compliance with existing procedures, the clearance recordwill not be signed and, unless the wing/installation commander directs otherwise, the PCS will be heldup until the custodial records are properly processed.21.4.3.  If the custodial records are incorrect and property is unaccounted for because of non-compli-ance with custodial transfer procedures, the custodians, any supervisors, or other personnel directlyinvolved in the transfer or who are responsible to see that proper procedures were followed will beconsidered contributorially negligent when the ROS is investigated because they created or condonedconditions or practices which favored the loss or damage of property.21.4.4.  These procedures are not applicable to transfer of custodianship in theaters of operations or incombat situations unless implemented by the wing/installation commander.AFMAN23-220   1 JULY 199685Chapter 22  AIR NATIONAL GUARD22.1.
