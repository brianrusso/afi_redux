(Add) Training on AED protocols is required for Emergency Services staff directly involved in patient care. Aerospace Medical Service Specialty Personnel (AFSC 4N0X1) assigned to emergency services, acute care clinics, back-up/ on-call ambulance crews, or nursing units utilizing AEDs on crash carts must accomplish AED qualification training semi-annually. ARC personnel require this training when working/assigned to an AD MTF.   Training will include the proper use of the AED device for adult and pediatric patients, identification of compatible AED pads and supplies, and demonstration of the proper use of the AED and compatible supplies in a mock emergency scenario.  (T-1)  2.17.1.3. (Add)  The plan must describe MTF process(es) for orienting and training staff on the use of ALS equipment and supplies, recognition of supplies compatible with MTF ALS response equipment (AED pads, fiber optic laryngoscope blades, etc. ), and define standards for the competent performance of ALS procedures before staff are assigned to emergency response duties. (T-1)  2.20.1.1. (Add)  4N0X1Xs providing emergency medical response, to include flight medicine, are to review the USAF Pre-Hospital protocols and pass a written exam (supplied by AFMOA) with a minimum passing score of 75% within 30 days of notification. No individual will be allowed to perform EMS functions without passing the exam.  The medical director will validate that each individual understands the protocols and grant permission to operate as an EMT/Paramedic responder. Every 4N0X1X will complete protocol familiarization training and exam whenever a change, update, or revision is made (T-0).  2.20.9.2. (Change) Any FES role in EMS above the EMR level must be clearly articulated in a Memorandum of Understanding/Agreement (MOU/A) per DoDI 4000.19, Support Agreements and AFI 25-201, Intra-Service, Intra-Agency, and Inter-Agency Support Agreements Procedures (T-0, DoDI 4000.19).  A risk assessment by the installation must be done and be provided to the AF EMSWG with the MOU/A to document the specific mission requirements.  Any increase in the levels of service must be coordinated and approved by the MAJCOM/A7 and MAJCOM/SG with concurrence of the EMS WG before the FES Flight can assume any level of care beyond EMR/NT. (T-1)  2.20.9.2.1. (Add) If the installation leadership and the AF EMSWG do not reach an agreement; the installation must request a waiver of official policy in accordance with AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management, para. 1.9. Waiver requests must be routed and approved by the appropriate officials until it reaches the appropriate Air Force Instruction OPR.  Waiver requests for FES operating above the Emergency Medical Responder (EMR) level that are beyond the requirements of the installation FES Standard of Care will not be funded by the Medical Treatment Facility (MTF).  2.20.9.2.1.2. (Add) After the MOU/A is signed at the local level and validated/approved by the MAJCOM/SG and MAJCOM/A7, the FES will be authorized EMS supplies and equipment from the local MTF as designated in the MOU/A.  The Air Force Medical Service (AFMS) will fund expendable medical supplies and equipment items for the quantity specified in the table of allowance (TA) for FES.  The list of authorized medical supplies and equipment will be 2 maintained on the USAF EMS Kx website.  Any supplies and items beyond validated TA requirements will not be funded by the MDG using DHP funds.   2.20.11.11. (Add) Will ensure any changes in an Air Force Installation’s Ambulance Services’ operations or the level of service is coordinated and approved by the Air Force EMS Working Group.  Medical Treatment Facilities will not close or transfer ambulance services from their facilities’ control to another entity. Additionally, facilities will not take ambulances used for flight line response out of service in exchange for other emergency response vehicles that do not have a patient transport capability.                                          3 ATTACHMENT 2 ID Wrist Band Standardization 2.31. (Add) Section 2Q - Patient Identification Wrist Band Standardization.  AFMS MTFs will standardize the use of color coded wristbands to be worn by inpatients to alert staff to patient risks.  This common sense approach to safety will establish a practice easily identifiable for both staff and patients. (T-1)  2.31.1. (Add) Color-coded alert wristbands will contain preprinted or embossed text clarifying the intent or message (Allergy, Fall, DNR).  Except in emergency situations, no handwriting will be applied to the color-coded wristbands (T-1) .  Reason for not writing on bands a.  Legibility may hinder the correct interpretation of the allergy listed b.  Someone could assume that the list of allergies written on the wristband is comprehensive.  Some patients have numerous allergies. c.  New allergies may be discovered during the hospitalization, but may not be 2.31.1.3. (Add)    For safety reasons, patients will be asked to remove non-MTF wristbands (community or social cause) wristbands in the hospital setting.  Community or social cause wristbands include but are not limited to charity and fashion bands (i.e., Live Strong).  Nurses will ask patients to remove non-MTF wristbands to prevent confusion with the MTF color-coded alert wristbands (T-1) .                 written on the allergy band.   2.31.1.1. (Add)   Color-coded alert wristbands should only be applied or removed by a nurse, preferably the nurse conducting the assessment.   2.31.1.2. (Add)   Standardized patient identification wrist bands will be restricted to the following across the Air Force Medical Service.  Each identification wristband will be pre-labeled with identified risk spelled out and visible to staff members (T-1).  a.  Clear/White  - Patient Identification  b.  Red – Allergy  c.  Yellow – Fall Risk  d.  Purple - Do Not Resuscitate (DNR)   4 ATTACHMENT 3 Induced Abortion  (Replace) 4.5.1.2.

These resources are available on line at https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/ovw/241903.pdf, http://www.sapr.mil, and http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/. These resources must be reviewed and used as the foundation to the execution of all aspects of medical response to sexual assault patients. 11.5.1.1. (Add) The term Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) will now be referred to as the Sexual Assault Medical Forensic Examiner (SAMFE), throughout the AFI.  (T-0, NDAA 2015, Section 539)  11.5.2.2. (Change) The MDOS/CC will appoint in writing a healthcare provider as an official, additional duty, to be the point of contact concerning Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Program policy and care. (T-0, DoDI 6495.02).  This POC may be a non-credentialed registered nurse (RN) and may also be identified as the “Sexual Assault Medical Manager (SAAM)” as identified in para 11.5.5.3.  11.5.3.1. (Change) Each MTF must have a written plan describing the medical response for sexual assault patients to include medical case management for emergent and follow-up care  IAW Department of Justice references in paragraph 11.5.1. of this instruction. (T-1)  11.5.3.2.1. (Change) Identify appropriate local resources for the performance of quality, patient-centered sexual assault medical forensic examination IAW Department of Justice references in paragraph 11.5.1. of this instruction.  (T-1)  11.5.3.2.3. (Change) Establish procedures for quality, patient-centered medical forensic care to address concerns, minimize trauma, and promote healing.  (T-0, DoDI 6495.02)  11.5.3.2.4.4. (Change) Local policies and procedures, the availability of sexual assault and domestic violence or intimate partner violence victim advocacy resources and the potential impact of State and local laws governing sexual assault.  (T-0, DoDI 6495.02) 11.5.3.4. (Change) The plan will establish protocols describing the provision, documentation and follow up of medical and mental health care for a sexual assault patient.  Components of the protocols will include testing, prophylactic treatment options, and follow-up care for possible exposure to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other sexually transmitted infections (STI).  When gender appropriate, patients will be assessed for the risk of pregnancy and options 9 for emergency contraception.  Procedures for emergency contraception are discussed in paragraph 8.4.6. of this instruction.  (T-0, DoDI 6495.02)  11.5.3.5. (Change)  At many MTFs sexual assault medical forensic examinations to include an evidence collection kit (SAFE) are not provided in-house because it is in the best interest of the patient to be referred to a center of excellence for the highest standard of care.  MTFs that do not provide a medical forensic exam and SAFE in-house must have a MOU/MOA with a local medical facility that includes the specific provision for a SAFE to be performed by an appropriate provider, trained registered nurse or health care provider.  (T-0, DoDI 6495.02)  11.5.3.5.1. (Change) MTFs will initially and upon renewal verify that the local facilities they have an MOU/MOA with meet the standards for forensic exams of sexual assault patients set forth by the Department of Justice reference in paragraph 11.5.1. of this instruction.

PRP notifications must be managed IAW DoDI 6495.02 enclosure 4.  Identifying sexual assault as the source of the injury and/or duty limitations is not appropriate.  The SARC or FAP is responsible for reporting non-PII to the installation commander.  Consult the MLC or servicing staff judge advocate if there are questions regarding releasable information under Restricted Reporting.  (T-0, DoDI 6495.02) 11.5.4.2. (Change) Medical and mental health record documentation under both restricted and unrestricted reporting must have special protection to avoid unauthorized release of information.   11.5.4.2.1. (Change, In Bold) Medical and mental health care, where the focus of the visit is related to sexual assault, regardless of the type of report, must be secured via a “break the glass” function and marked as sensitive   11.5.5.3. (Change)  In MTFs and Clinics that do not provide full, 24 hour, Emergency Department services, an appropriately trained Sexual Assault Medical Manager (SAMM) must be made available to a patient of the facility. (T-0, NDAA 2015, Section 539)  11.5.5.3.1. (Change) SAMMs at these facilities will be the primary medical POC for patients who receive their medical forensic examination and treatment via MOU with local community facilities.  The SAMM will facilitate any follow up care and specialty care needs ensuring that local MOUs meet the medical needs of the patient who may require medical forensic exams. (T-1)  11.5.5.3.2. (Add) MDOS/CC appoints in writing the SAMM, who is either a privileged provider or RN who can best meet the needs of the population for patient care.  The MDOS/CC should 10 realize the importance of continuity of care, provider/RN availability, responsiveness to patients and gender sensitivity when choosing a provider or RN to fill this role.  This individual may also be the designated SAPR POC identified in section 11.5.2 above. 11.5.6.2. (Change) Each MTF will require all personnel to take Sexual Assault Medical Response Course for Health Care Personnel on an annual basis. The on-line pathway to this training is: ADLS, ADLS Gateway, Med+Learn, Course List, USAFSAM-General. MTFs can monitor the course training data through ADLS or MRDSS. Sexual Assault Medical Response Course for Health Care Personnel is in addition to all other Sexual Assault Prevention and Response training. (T-0, DoDI 6495.02) 11.5.6.1.1. (Add) All MDOS/CC appointed SAMMs must complete a minimum of 40 hours civilian SANE-A or Inter-Service SAMFE-A training.  This training may be completed on line. 11.5.6.3.1. (Change) All Sexual Assault Medical Forensic Examiners (SAMFE)  must complete a minimum of 40 hours civilian SANE-A or Inter-Service SAMFE-A training, and meet, at a minimum, initial and annual refresher training as outlined in the U.S. Department of Justice’s National Protocol for Medical Sexual Assault Examination.  The Inter-Service SAMFE-A is the preferred method of training since it provides information specific to conducting medical forensic exams in the military environment. SAMFEs must meet all training requirements to be considered competent to conduct medical forensic exams (SAMFE-A, Phase I).  If pursuing SAMFE-A or SANE-A certification, program designated preceptorship (e.g. SAMFE-A, Phase II) is required (T-0).  11.5.7.1. (Change) Each Expeditionary Medical Support (EMEDS) facility must have a written plan describing medical response for an Armed Forces sexual assault patient.  (T-0, DoDI 6495.02) 11.5.7.3.1. (Add) For deployers, training requirements should be identified as early as possible.  The Inter-Service SAMFE-A, should be the first choice, and a priority whenever possible.  When scheduling does not allow, the civilian SANE-A course should be considered.  Last option considered should be the in-place training video as currently identified in section 11.5.7.3. 11.5.7.4. (Change) Sexual assault patients who exceed the local EMEDS capabilities will be transported to the appropriate level of care IAW established aeromedical evacuation standards.  (T-1) 11.6. (Change) Forensic Examination of Suspects. The technical information listed in paragraph 11.5.1. of this instruction regarding medical forensic exams can be applied to the non-treatment oriented forensic exam of a suspect. 11.6.1. (Change) At deployed and non-deployed MTFs that provide medical forensic exams in-house, the MTF will also perform suspect exams.  The medical response plan will be appended if necessary to include any MTF specific information regarding suspect exams.  Providers who perform suspect exams must be trained IAW paragraph 11.5.6. of this instruction.  (T-1) 11.6.2. (Change) Defense Health Program funds cannot pay for suspect exams.

The SGB serves as a special staff advisor on BSC issues including strategic and operational  planning,  design  of  services,  resource  allocations,  and  decisions  regarding utilization and assignment of personnel within the Medical Group.  (T-1) 1.3.8.  Privileged Providers: 1.3.8.1.  Privileged  healthcare  providers  assume  complete  responsibility  for  evaluating their  patients’  medical  and  dental  problems  and  for  prescribing  an  individualized therapeutic program within the scope of their clinical privileges.  This includes providing age and condition appropriate preventive services. 1.3.8.2.  The responsibility for the care of each admitted inpatient must be assigned to a provider  fully  privileged  for  the  scope  of  care  appropriate  to  the  inpatient  unit.    (T-0, TJC) 1.3.8.3.  A provider will see and evaluate his/her designated inpatients at least once each day, and document the visit.  (T-1) 1.3.8.4.  A  privileged  provider  granted  privileges  for  the  scope  of  care  required  of  an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) will evaluate their patients in an intensive care environment at least twice each day, and document each visit.  (T-1) 1.3.8.5.  Privileged  providers  generally  should  not  treat  themselves  or  members  of  their immediate families.  Professional  objectivity may be compromised when the immediate family member or the provider is the patient. 1.3.8.5.1.

Except for the emergency or isolated situations mentioned above, providers may not prescribe medications for themselves. 1.3.8.5.4.  Providers  who  prescribe  medications  not  on  the  controlled  substances  list for  their  family  members  must  ensure  that  the  treatment  is  within  their  scope  of privileges, an evaluation is completed, and documentation of that evaluation is placed in the family member’s health record.  (T-0, TJC, AAAHC) 1.3.8.5.5.  Providers  should  not  order  labs,  x-rays,  consults/referrals  or  perform procedures on themselves. Section 1C—Limited Scope Medical Treatment Facilities (LSMTF) 1.4.  Definitions. 1.4.1.  LSMTFs are medical elements, flights, or small medical squadrons with a credentialed medical  provider  that  do  not  provide  the  scope  of  services  found  in  a  medical  group.  LSMTFs are typically assigned to a line squadron or group (e.g. Air Base Squadron, Mission Support Group or Air Base Group).  In some cases, a LSMTF may report directly to a wing or MAJCOM.  In the event multiple MAJCOM assets are involved, the parent and supporting MAJCOM approve the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). 1.4.1.1.  LSMTFs are officially designated in the AFMS Flight Path and also referenced in AFI 38-101. 1.4.2.  Medical  Aid  Stations  are  small  medical  elements  without  a  privileged  medical provider  and  are  typically  located  at  a  geographically  separated  unit  or  Munitions  Support Squadron site. 1.4.3.  Munitions Support Squadron (MUNSS) are geographically separated units responsible for  receipt,  storage,  maintenance  and  control  of  United  States  War  Reserve  Munitions  in support of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and its strike missions. 1.4.4.  Geographically  separated  units  (GSU)  are  units  that  are  not  at  the  same  physical location or base as the parent unit. 1.4.5.  Line-owned  Medical  Clinics:    There  are  circumstances  where  some  privileged providers  and  non-privileged  medical  staff  care  for  patients  in  an  outpatient  setting  apart from  the  host  MTF.    One  example  of  this  would  be  AFSOC’s  Ambulatory  Care  Units.  Although  these  medical  assets  are  line-owned,  unless  designated  as  a  MTF  or  LSMTF, medical care will adhere to the host MTF policies and medical staff bylaws.  The MTF will support the provision of care in these settings as noted in AFI 48-149, Flight and Operational Medicine Program (FOMP). 1.5.  LSMTF Waiver Process. 1.5.1.  LSMTFs  may  not  have  sufficient  personnel  to  provide  all  services  or  meet  all requirements described in this AFI.  All services provided are done in a safe manner ensuring the  highest  quality  care.    Some  required  services/requirements  may  be  provided  by  a supporting MTF or through civilian services. 1.5.2.

(T-2) 2.23.1.4.  Warm patient hand-offs.  Prior to departing the host MTF, the visiting provider must  have  a  face-to-face  discussion  and  provide  appropriately  detailed  information regarding patient care delivered during their visit to the responsible host MTF provider(s) who will provide follow up care and assume responsibility for the patients in the absence of the visiting specialty provider.  (T-2) 2.23.2.  Visiting  specialty  providers  should,  to  the  greatest  degree  possible,  plan  their  visits such  that  they  are  locally  available  during  the  period  of  time  when  complications  from treatment or surgery are most likely to occur. 2.23.3.  Visiting  specialty  providers  will  recommend  to  the  host  MTF  a  potential  list  of treatments/procedures.    The  host  MTF  SGH  will  approve  this  list  following  coordination with  appropriate  MTF  staff.    The  performance  of  any  procedures  not  specified  on  the approved list must be approved in advance by the host MTF SGH.  (T-2) AFI44-102  17 MARCH 2015   29  2.23.4.  The  supporting  MTF/CC  is  responsible  for  providing  the  credentials  and  privileges of the visiting provider to the host MTF via a credentials transfer brief IAW 44-119.  (T-2) 2.23.5.  Peer review of care rendered at the host MTF by the visiting specialty provider will be  coordinated  between  the  host  MTF  and  the  supporting  MTF.    This  arrangement  will  be outlined in the MOA.  (T-2) Section 2M—Medication Reconciliation 2.24.  Medication  Reconciliation.  Medication  reconciliation  is  the  process  of  identifying  the most accurate list of all medications that the patient is taking, including name, dosage, frequency, and  route,  by  comparing  the  medical  record  to  an  external  list  of  medications  obtained  from  a patient, hospital, or other provider. 2.24.1.  Medication reconciliation will occur when a provider receives a patient from another setting  of  care  or  provider  of  care  or  believes  an  encounter  is  relevant.      This  includes performing medication reconciliation prior to discharge from an inpatient facility.  (T-1) 2.24.2.  Each  MTF  will  develop  policy  that  insures  medical  reconciliation  is  completed  in accordance  with  civilian  accrediting  bodies  and  the  National  Patient  Safety  Goals  (NPSG).  (T-1) 2.24.2.1.  This  policy  will  address,  as  appropriate  for  the  MTF,  special  patient populations  such  as  patients  with  complex  medical  needs,  wounded  warriors  and/or patients  from  other  branches  of  the  service.    Due  to  their  often  complex  medication therapies,  the  management  and  reconciliation  of  multiple  medications  in  the  wounded warrior population is of especially high importance to the AF and DoD.  AF MTF policy will  seek  to  maximize  patient  safety  and  the  prevention  of  accidental  overdose  and suicide.  (T-1) 2.24.2.2.  The medication reconciliation process should include: 2.24.2.2.1.  Finding out what medicines the patient is taking. 2.24.2.2.2.  Recording and sharing correct information about a patient's medicines. 2.24.2.2.3.  Comparing those medicines to new medicines provided to the patient. 2.24.2.2.4.  Making  sure  the  patient  understands  their  medication  (what  they  are taking and why, dosage, and times) before they leave the MTF. 2.24.2.2.5.  Encouraging  the  patient  to  bring  their  up-to-date  list  of  medicines  every time they see a provider.

MTFs  must  ensure  there  will  be  adequate  capability  to  administer  women’s  health periodic  examinations  within  the  direct-care  system  or  network  for  all  female  beneficiaries age  18  years  and  older,  and  for  those  under  the  age  of  18  years  who  are  sexually  active.  These  capabilities  must  include  at  least  the  following:    Papanicolaou  smear  (Pap  smear), pelvic  examination,  breast  examination,  family  planning  and  contraceptive  counseling  for those desiring this service.  (T-1) 4.1.2.  MTFs  must  develop  policies  to  ensure  reporting  Pap  smears  results  to  the  patient within 14 duty days from collection of the specimen.  EXCEPTION:  At isolated clinics or overseas locations, report the results within 30 duty days.  (T-1) 4.1.3.  Nationally recognized guidelines, such as those published by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists or the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), shall govern  the  frequency  and  content  of  periodic  screening  examinations.    Medical  readiness requirements  may  necessitate  more  frequent  screening. the  variation  of recommendations from different guidelines, the provider should discuss aspects of screening with the patient and document this in the medical record.  (T-1)   Given 4.1.4.  MTFs  will  follow  the  American  Academy  of  Pediatrics  (AAP)  published  Bright Futures  Guidelines  for  Health  Supervision  of  Infants,  Children  and  Adolescents  or  other similar authority for periodic health maintenance recommendations.  (T-1) 4.2.  Breast Imaging. 4.2.1.  Screening mammograms may be performed in the MTF where the service is available or  in  the  purchased  care  system  when  the  MTF  cannot  provide  the  service.    The  initial screening mammogram and frequency of subsequent screening shall be guided by discussion between the patient and provider, guided by current guidelines and incorporating patient risk factors and personal preferences.  (T-1) 4.2.1.1.  Accepting  self-referring/self-requesting  patients  who  have  not  had  a  Clinical Breast  Exam  (CBE) prior to  breast  imaging is  an acceptable practice within the AFMS.  Each MTF must develop a local policy regarding self-referrals/self-requests for screening mammograms,  which  addresses  the  following  areas:    the  process  how  a  patient  may schedule the mammogram, how the Primary Care Manager (PCM) will be notified of the patient’s request  for the  mammogram,  the process for identification/disposition of those requesting  services  more  often  than  clinically  indicated  and  the  follow-up  process  for clinical breast care after the mammogram.  (T-1) 4.2.2.  MTFs must make diagnostic breast imaging available to women at any age who have been  identified  by  their  healthcare  providers  as  requiring  additional  evaluation  as  indicated by individual risk factors.  The procedure may be performed in the MTF where the service is available or in the purchased care system when the MTF cannot provide the service.  (T-1)   38  AFI44-102  17 MARCH 2015 4.2.3.  Radiology Services will provide appointments within 30 calendar days of the request for screening mammography, and within five days for diagnostic breast imaging.  (T-1) 4.2.4.  Where  the  MTF  provides  the  mammography  service,  providers  (either  the  ordering provider or the interpreting radiologist, according to the written local practice) will notify the patient of test results within 14 duty days for screening mammograms and five duty days for diagnostic breast imaging, and assist the patient to make appropriate follow-up appointments.  (T-1) 4.2.5.  Mammograms  shall  only  be  performed  at  locations  (in  the  MTF  or  in  the  purchased care system) that are accredited by the American College of Radiology (ACR), an accrediting body approved by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) IAW 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 900, Mammography Accreditation, or a host nation equivalent for OCONUS locations.  (T-1) 4.2.5.1.  As the ACR and DoD have presently no mechanism for determining host nation equivalence, review of site procedures for ensuring clinical quality and appropriate dose delivery  may  be  made  by  a  Mammography  Quality  Standards  Act  (MQSA)  qualified radiologist  and  medical  physicist.    This  may  be  appropriate  if  host  nation  services  are found  to  be  a  quality  option.    An  initial  MSQA  survey  performed  by  an  AF  medical physics consultant and a clinical site visit by the lead interpreting AF radiologist must be performed  at  the  host  nation  facility  prior  to  use  of  their  mammography  services.  Annually or  after any major equipment  repair/modification the host nation facility must make available to the regional AF medical physics consultant a report that includes at a minimum:  1)  an  MQSA  image  quality  phantom  evaluation  and  2)  the  mean  glandular dose  equivalent  for  a  50-50,  4.2  cm  breast.    Additional  test  results  to  show  compliance with the ACR accreditation standards are highly encouraged.  (T-1) 4.2.5.2.  Telemammography  may  be  practiced  when  appropriate  accreditation  of  digital mammography acquisition and interpretation can be certified at both sites and procedures are  in  place  to  assure  appropriate  technologist  oversight,  timely  interpretation,  and  a mechanism  for  diagnostic  workup  of  patients  requiring  further  evaluation  in  a  timely manner.    A  challenging  cost  benefit  analysis  should  be  carefully  weighed  where  this  is considered for remote locations with sufficient population to warrant the service. 4.2.6.  Local policy will guide breast imaging sign-out procedures: 4.2.6.1.  Original  breast  images  will  be  released  to  the  patient  or  to  an  authorized designee upon request.  (T-1) 4.2.6.2.  Strict  sign-out  procedures  will  be  instituted  and  maintained  to  ensure accountability for the films.  Permanent transfer to another MTF is permitted.  (T-1) Section 4B—Gynecological Services 4.3.  Gynecological Care. 4.3.1.  Acute  or  emergent  gynecologic  services  must  be  made  available  in  the  direct  or purchased  healthcare  system.    Patients  with  emergent  problems  shall  be  seen  immediately, and those with urgent problems shall be seen within one duty day.  Clarification of degree of AFI44-102  17 MARCH 2015   39  urgency should be accomplished through discussion  between the  referring provider and the gynecologic services provider.  (T-0, TRICARE policy) 4.3.2.  MTFs will ensure that routine gynecologic care is available within 28 calendar days.  (T-0, TRICARE policy) 4.4.  Emergency Contraception.  See Chapter 8, Pharmacy Services, paragraph 8.4.6. 4.5.  Induced Abortion (Refer to Section 2C, Treating Minors also). 4.5.1.  Federal Law (10 United States Code (U.S.C.) §1093) prohibits the use of DoD funds to  pay  for  abortion.    EXCEPTION:    AF  facilities  (in  the  Continental  United  States  and Outside  the  Continental  United  States)  and  appropriated  funds  may  be  used  to  perform abortions  under  the  following  circumstances:  where  the  life  of  the  mother  would  be endangered if the fetus were carried to term or in the case in which the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or incest.  (T-0, 10 U.S.C. §1093) 4.5.1.1.  When an abortion is performed under circumstances where the life of the mother is  endangered, MTF providers will certify the procedure is  medically necessary and the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term. This certification will be documented in the medical record. 4.5.1.2.  In the case of an abortion for rape or incest, MTF providers will document in the medical record their good faith belief that the patient was a victim of rape or incest. See Chapter  11  section  11.5.  of  this  instruction  for  additional  guidance  on  management  of victims of sexual assault. 4.5.1.2.1.  If a provider does not have a good faith belief the pregnancy is the result of rape  or  incest,  then  the  provider  should  utilize  the  local  ethical  dilemma  resolution process to resolve the situation. 4.5.2.  Medical  personnel  who  have  a  personal  or  moral  objection  to  abortion  need  not perform or assist in the abortion procedure but are obligated to facilitate timely identification of a willing provider if the patient qualifies for an abortion at a MTF.  NOTE:  This applies only to personnel directly involved in performing the abortion procedure itself. 4.5.3.  When the patient is an adult or an emancipated minor (as determined by the applicable law), only the patient’s consent for the abortion is required.  Consult the MLC or servicing staff judge advocate if there are questions of whether a patient is an emancipated minor. 4.5.4.  When the patient is a minor, healthcare providers will follow state law (in the United States)  or  local  policy  (outside  the  United  States)  when  obtaining  valid  consent,  in accordance with Section 2C, Treating Minors of this instruction.  If the law/policy allows the minor  to  provide  consent  when  a  healthcare  provider  deems  her  sufficiently  mature,  the MTF/CC (or SGH in the event that the MTF/CC is not a physician) will make that judgment.  (T-1) 4.5.4.1.  Consultation  with  the  base  legal  services  and  the  Medical  Law  Consultant  are recommended whenever these situations arise. 4.5.5.  The  Air  Force  will  respect  host  nation  laws  regarding  abortion.    The  consent procedures  described  above  in  paragraphs  4.5.3.  and  4.5.4.  of  this  instruction  apply  in  the absence of controlling host nation laws or legal requirements.  (T-1)   40  AFI44-102  17 MARCH 2015 4.5.6.  Any  complication  resulting  from  an  elective  abortion  procedure  will  be  treated  as would any medical problem/complication.  (T-1) 4.5.7.  Supplemental material  regarding pregnancy termination is located on the Kx website at https://kx2.afms.mil/kj/kx5/obgyn/Pages/home.aspx. Section 4C—Family Planning 4.6.  Family Planning Services Provided (Refer to Section 2C, Treating Minors also):  MTFs will  provide  family  planning  services  including  contraceptives  and  sterilization  through  the direct or purchased care system.  NOTE:  Medical personnel who, for moral or ethical, religious or professional grounds, object to providing family planning services need not perform or assist in  such  procedures  but  are  obligated  to  facilitate  timely  identification  of  a  willing  provider.  Medical  personnel  should  register  their  objections  to  the  SGH  or  Department  Chairperson  on arrival to the MTF.  This will allow sufficient time to make alternative arrangements for family planning services prior to the need arising.  (T-1) 4.7.  Sterilization (Refer to Section 2C, Treating Minors also). 4.7.1.  The patient requests sterilization by signing AF Form 1302, Request and Consent for Sterilization. The signature of a spouse or significant other is not required. 4.7.2.  MTFs  may  perform  sterilization  procedures  or  refer  patients  to  another  MTF  or civilian facility where the procedure is available. Section 4D—Medical Care Related to Pregnancy 4.8.  Standards (Refer to Section 2C, Treating Minors and Section 4E, Newborn Care also). 4.8.1.  The Air Force adheres to the Newborns’ and Mothers’ Health Protection Act of 1996, and  respects  the  standards  published  in  the  American  College  of  Obstetricians  and Gynecologists (ACOG)  Manual  of Standards in  Obstetric-Gynecologic Practice  and ACOG technical  bulletins.    In  certain  situations,  an  MTF  may  need  to  develop  more  specific guidance.    All  hospitals  offering  labor  and  delivery  services  shall  be  equipped  to  perform emergency  Cesarean  section  (C-section)  delivery  per  the  guidelines  published  by  the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.  (T-1) 4.8.2.  IAW the Newborns’ and Mothers’ Health Protection Act, the following standards are expected: 4.8.2.1.  Inpatient maternity care provided by the AFMS will be available for a minimum of  48  hours  following  a  normal  delivery,  and  for  a  minimum  of  96  hours  following delivery  by  C-section.    No  additional  approval  or  authorization  is  needed  for  care  that falls within these guidelines.  (T-1) 4.8.2.2.  The length of post-delivery hospital care shall involve consideration of maternal and infant health, a psychosocial assessment of the family’s ability to care for a newborn infant, and the availability of follow-up care for both mother and infant.  (T-1) 4.8.2.3.  A mother and her newborn may be discharged from the hospital in less than 48 or  96  hours,  providing  that  the  decision  is  made  by  the  attending  provider(s)  in consultation with the infant’s mother.  (T-1) AFI44-102  17 MARCH 2015   41  4.8.2.4.  Adherence to this policy does not  require a beneficiary to either give birth in a hospital, or to stay in the hospital for a fixed period of time following the birth of a child. 4.8.3.  The  AF/SG  endorses  the  policy  of  ACOG  and  AAP  Guidelines  for  Perinatal  Care, "Although  the  Committee  on  Obstetric  Practice  believes  that  hospitals  and  birthing  centers are the safest setting for birth, it respects the right of a woman to make a medically informed decision about delivery. Women inquiring about  planned home birth should be informed of its  risks  and  benefits  based  on  recent  evidence.  Specifically,  they  should  be  informed  that although  the  absolute  risk  may  be  low,  planned  home  birth  is  associated  with  a  twofold  to threefold  increased  risk  of  neonatal  death  when  compared  with  planned  hospital  birth. Importantly, women should be informed that the appropriate selection of candidates for home birth; the availability of a certified nurse-midwife, certified midwife, or physician practicing within an integrated and regulated health system; ready access to consultation; and assurance of  safe  and  timely  transport  to  nearby  hospitals  are  critical  to  reducing  perinatal  mortality rates and achieving favorable home birth outcomes."  Due to the two to three fold increased risk of neonatal death  referenced above, the Air Force does not favor home delivery.  If an elective  home  delivery  on  base  is  planned  nonetheless,  the  installation  Commander,  in consultation with the MTF/CC, will first ascertain to his/her satisfaction whether the provider participating  in  the  delivery  is  properly  licensed  by  the  host  jurisdiction  to  perform  the procedure and that the welfare of personnel on base is not jeopardized.  (T-1) 4.9.  Vaginal Delivery Sponge and Sharp Counts on Labor and Delivery Units. 4.9.1.  Unintended Retained Foreign Object (URFO) events associated with vaginal delivery are considered sentinel events.  MTFs will report these events to the local Patient Safety and Risk Manager.  (T-1) 4.9.2.  MTFs  will  develop  a  policy/operating  instruction  with  a  standardized  method  to account for sponges, sharps, needles and other miscellaneous items during a vaginal delivery.  The  policy  will  include  the  use  of  radio-opaque  tailed  sponges,  pre  and  post  procedural counting of sponges and needles and documentation in the patient record of who counted and that the count was correct.  (T-1) 4.9.2.1.  The  MTF  will  comply  with  the  algorithm,  “Unintended  Retained  Foreign Objects During Vaginal Delivery” in Attachment 2 of this instruction, and develop a plan for orientation, training  and sustainment.   Monitoring and  reporting the  effectiveness  of this process is critical, therefore, the MTF shall monitor for trends.  (T-1) 4.9.3.  MTFs will ensure only radio-opaque tailed sponges are stocked in Labor and Delivery and placed in all delivery packs for use.  Sponges will remain originally configured and will not be cut.  Staff will ensure a count sheet accompanies all delivery and precipitous delivery packs maintained on labor and delivery units.  (T-1) 4.9.4.  Two  individuals,  one  of  whom  will  be  a  Registered  Nurse  (RN),  Advanced  Practice Nurse  (APN),  or  Physician  (MD  or  DO),  will  perform  all  counts.    Personnel  will  separate sponges being counted.  Sponges will be counted audibly and concurrently viewed during the procedure.  Additional  sponges or items  added to the field  will be counted at  that time and recorded as part of the count documentation to ensure accuracy.  (T-1)   42  AFI44-102  17 MARCH 2015 4.9.5.  Labor and Delivery personnel will perform a “Call Out” when a sponge is placed in a body  cavity  and  when  a  sponge  is  intentionally  left  in  place.    There  will  be  written documentation of placement and removal of intentionally placed vaginal sponges.  (T-1) 4.9.6.  Provider called away from delivery.   If the delivering provider is urgently called away from  the delivery, the final  count  will be completed by two other qualified members of the labor and delivery team.  One member will be an RN, APN, or MD/DO.  (T-1) 4.9.7.  The count sheet will not become part of the patient record.  It will be discarded after use.  The provider of care will document in the patient record who counted and that the count was  correct,  or  the  findings  and  results  from  actions  implemented  for  unreconciled  counts.  (T-1) 4.9.8.  Additional  Counts.    At  any  time  a  member  of  the  team  may  request  an  extra  count.  The  delivering  provider  will  determine  whether  the  patient’s  status  and/or  the  situation warrant the extra count. 4.9.9.  Incorrect  Counts.    When  the  final  count  is  incorrect,  the  counting  process  will  be repeated,  with  special  attention  to  performing  a  vaginal  and/or  rectal  exam,  opening  of saturated  sponges,  inspection  of  the  under-buttocks  drape,  and  inspection  of  the  floor  and surrounding area.  If the repeat count remains incorrect, a pelvic radiograph must be obtained for a potential URFO.  The delivering provider along with the radiology team may determine whether  a  portable  x-ray  is  adequate.    If  the  count  still  cannot  be  reconciled,  this  must  be documented  in  the  patient’s  record,  an  incident  report  must  be  completed,  and  the  patient safety representative must be informed.  (T-1) 4.9.10.  Precipitous Deliveries.  Precipitous deliveries occurring on labor and delivery, in the field, ambulances, emergency room, and clinics, in which obtaining a baseline count was not performed or able to be reconciled, the provider of care will perform a vaginal sweep, obtain an x-ray for URFO, complete an incident report and document the results of the pelvic exam and  x-ray  in  the  patient  record.    The  incident  report  will  be  forwarded  to  the  patient  safety manager.  (T-1) 4.9.10.1.  Precipitous  delivery  packs  maintained  on  labor  and  delivery  units  usually contain  no  countable  items.  Once  opened,  radio-opaque  tailed  sponges,  additional countable items and a count sheet will be added to precipitous delivery packs.  A baseline count will be performed if time permits.  (T-1) 4.9.10.2.  Precipitous  delivery  packs  maintained  in  the  field,  ambulances,  emergency room,  clinics,  and  areas  with  pre-packaged  delivery  kits,  do  not  need  to  be  replaced  if current,  however,  replacing  the  packs  to  meet  URFO  requirements  is  strongly recommended as the kits approach expiration.  (T-1) 4.9.11.  Patient  transfer  to  OR  or  ICU.    If  the  patient  is  moved  from  labor  and  delivery  to another  unit  within  the  facility,  a  final  count  of  the  vaginal  delivery  equipment  will  be performed prior to transport, if the patient’s status permits.  If a final count is not completed due  to  patient’s  condition,  this  will  be  relayed  to  the  accepting  staff  during  hand-off communication and documented in the record.  An x-ray for potential URFO will be obtained once the patient’s status permits.  The results will be documented in the patient record.  An incident report will be completed and forwarded to the patient safety manager.  (T-1) AFI44-102  17 MARCH 2015   43  4.9.12.  Patient  transferred  to  civilian  hospital.    If  patient  is  transferred  to  a  civilian institution,  and  a  final  count  is  not  completed,  this  information  will  be  relayed  to  the accepting staff during hand-off communication and documented in  the record.  An incident report will be completed and forwarded to the patient safety manager.  (T-1) 4.10.  Trial of Labor for Vaginal Birth after Cesarean Section (VBAC). 4.10.1.  MTFs  shall  provide  the  option  for  trial  of  labor  for  VBAC.    Options  include attempting a trial of labor at  the local  MTF, referring the patient  to  local  civilian care or if OCONUS  offering  aeromedical  evacuation  to  an  MTF  that  has  the  ability  to  provide  this service.  (T-1) 4.10.2.  MTFs providing a trial of labor to attempt a VBAC must have an obstetric provider with  cesarean  section  privileges,  a  privileged  provider  of  anesthesia  (anesthesiologist  or anesthetist), surgical support to include a circulating nurse, and scrub technician available in-hospital  for  the  duration  of  active  labor  and  delivery  to  perform  an  emergency  cesarean section.  (T-1) 4.10.3.  Trial  of  labor  to  attempt  a  VBAC  is  NOT  a  contraindication  to  receiving  epidural anesthesia  for  labor  and  delivery,  or  for  the  use  of  an  oxytocic  agent  for  induction  or augmentation of labor. 4.10.4.  Misoprostol (Cytotec) shall NOT be used for cervical ripening or induction of labor in  patients  who  have  had  a  previous  cesarean  delivery  or  major  uterine  surgery.    If misoprostol is used in first or second trimester labor stimulations (e.g.in cases of embryonic or  fetal  demise)  the  lowest  effective  dose  should  be  used  and  other  medical  or  surgical options to affect the delivery should be considered.  (T-1) 4.11.  Epidural Anesthesia for Delivery. 4.11.1.  MTFs shall provide the option of epidural anesthesia or analgesia for normal vaginal deliveries.  Options include performing the procedure at the local MTF, referring the patient to  local  civilian  care  and  if  OCONUS  offering  aeromedical  evacuation  to  an  MTF  that  has the ability to provide this service.  (T-1) 4.11.2.  A  physician  with  obstetrical  privileges  or  a  similarly  privileged  provider  fully familiar  with  the  case  will  remain  readily  available  to  manage  the  patient’s  progress.  “Readily available” will be defined by MTF policy, based on the local situation.  (T-1) 4.11.3.  A physician with C-section privileges must concur with the plan of management.  (T-1) 4.12.  Use of Oxytocic Drugs in Pregnancy. 4.12.1.  Prior  to  the  initiation  of  an  oxytocic  agent,  a  provider  privileged  in  obstetrics (obstetrician,  family  physician  or  certified  nurse  midwife)  must  evaluate  the  maternal  and fetal  status  and  progress  of  labor.    When  oxytocin  is  used  during  labor,  a  provider  with  C-section  privileges  shall  be  readily  available.    “Readily  available”  will  be  defined  by  MTF policy, based on the local situation.  Personnel familiar with the effects of oxytocin and who are  able  to  identify  maternal  and  fetal  complications  shall  be  in  attendance  during administration of oxytocin.  (T-1)   44  AFI44-102  17 MARCH 2015 4.12.2.  A  physician  with  C-section  privileges  must  concur  with  the  plan  for  using  the oxytocic agent, the management of labor, and, along with the facility, if emergently needed, must be prepared to initiate C- section within 30 minutes of the time the decision is made that C-section is indicated.  (T-1) 4.13.  Restrictions for USAF Military Personnel During Pregnancy and Profiles.  The MTF employed obstetrical healthcare provider or the PCM with recommendations from the obstetrical healthcare  provider  will  immediately  inform  Public  Health  of  AD  personnel  who  are  pregnant IAW  local  procedure.    They  will  provide  recommendations  on  an  AF  Form  469  IAW  AFI  10-203.    If  at  any  point  the  status  of  the  pregnancy  changes,  the  AF  Form  469  will  be  updated appropriately.  (T-1) 4.14.  Assignment Curtailment in Isolated or Remote Areas. 4.14.1.  Pregnant  members  assigned  to  isolated  or  remote  areas  without  appropriate obstetrical care will have their assignments curtailed by the 24th week of pregnancy or earlier and are reassigned by AFPC.  (T-1) 4.14.2.  If  local  medical  personnel  are  not  capable  of  managing  the  early  complications  of pregnancy  or the pregnancy is complicated, the  member’s assignment shall be  immediately curtailed.  (T-1) 4.15.  Breastfeeding and Breast Pumping. 4.15.1.  Breastfeeding provides optimal health benefits for both mother and infant throughout their  life  spans.    Exclusive  breastfeeding  is  optimal  nutrition  for  the  first  6  months  of  life.  Gradual  introduction  of  solids  begins  in  the  second  half  of  the  first  year  and  complements human  milk,  which  remains  essential  to  nutrition  during  this  period.    Extensive  medical research has documented that breastfeeding has significant health, nutritional, immunologic, developmental,  emotional,  social,  and  economic  benefits  to  mother  and  baby.    The  AFMS recommends that supervisors of AF members who are breastfeeding work with the member to arrange their work schedules to allow 15-30 minutes every 3-4 hours to pump breast milk in a room or an area that provides adequate privacy and cleanliness.  Restrooms should not be  considered  an  appropriate  location  for  pumping.    The  AF  member  must  supply  the equipment needed to pump and store the breast milk. 4.15.2.  AF  members  who  are  breastfeeding  or  pumping  remain  eligible  for  field  training, mobility  exercises,  and  deployment.    However,  AFI  36-2110,  Assignments,  supports deferment  from  deployment  for  6  months  post-partum.  AF  commanders  may  consider supporting deferment of deployment for breastfeeding mothers for 12 months post-partum to ensure the full medical benefits of breastfeeding. 4.15.3.  The  AFMS  encourages  commanders’  modifications  of  these  activities  and/or  work conditions  for  Airmen  who  are  breastfeeding,  when  possible.   Nonetheless,  duty requirements may not always be compatible with exclusive breastfeeding.  In these cases, the AF  member  must  decide  in  consultation  with  her  medical  provider  whether  to  attempt  to continue breast-feeding and/or pumping breast milk.  AF Form 469 is not the mechanism for documentation that an AF member is breastfeeding. AFI44-102  17 MARCH 2015   45  4.16.  Illness During the Prenatal Period. 4.16.1.  Providers  may  not  recommend  convalescent  leave  during  the  prenatal  period  for pregnancy-related time off work. 4.16.2.  Providers may authorize quarters as usual for up to 72 hours for medical issues not related to the pregnancy.  For issues related to the pregnancy, use Obstetrical Quarters (OB Quarters) status.  NOTE:  There is no duration limitation on OB Quarters, but the attending provider  must  evaluate  the  patient  at  least  weekly  and  document  this  evaluation  in  the medical record.  (T-1) 4.17.  Evaluation of Pregnant Civilian Employees. 4.17.1.  When  a  civilian  who  is  employed  by  the  Air  Force  presents  confirmation  of pregnancy to the supervisor, the supervisor refers her to the MTF Public Health section. 4.17.2.  Bioenvironmental Engineering evaluates workplace risks in conjunction with Public Health and Aerospace Medicine, advises the employee of any identified risks, and reports the risks  with  any  recommended  techniques  for  avoiding  the  risks  to  the  employee  and  her supervisor. 4.17.3.  When  the  obstetrical  healthcare  provider  is  a  civilian,  recommendations  will  be reviewed by a military medical provider through the Force Health Management section, who will make a final duty recommendation to the civilian employee and her supervisor.  (T-1) Section 4E—Newborn Care 4.18.  Newborn Screening. 4.18.1.  All  state  screening  programs  now  perform  the  29  screens  and  many  perform additional  testing,  counseling  and  follow-up.    MTFs  must  develop  written  policies  and procedures  for  screening  and  treatment  programs  using  state  health  requirements  and  the guidelines in the most recent edition of Guidelines for Perinatal Care, prepared by the AAP and  ACOG.    Results  of  newborn  screening  should  be  entered  into  the  patient’s  medical record.  (T-1) 4.18.2.  Each  MTF  caring  for  newborns  should  develop  and  implement  a  prescribed  formal process  to  address  abnormal  Newborn  Metabolic  screening  results.    The  process  should address the following issues: 4.18.2.1.  Process for contacting the ordering provider 4.18.2.2.  Knowledge of urgency of results 4.18.2.3.  Need for and type of confirmatory testing 4.18.2.4.  Appropriate follow-up with timely specialty care referrals. 4.18.3.  MTFs  are  strongly  encouraged  to  utilize  their  State  Newborn  Metabolic  Screening programs  for  laboratory  support,  consultations  and  beneficiary  follow  up  care.    A  formal process is defined as designated personnel capable of implementing actions immediately for critical  results,  contacting  and  ensuring  ordering  provider  has  adequate  information  for clinical  follow  up.    The  MTF  personnel  should  be  readily  available  to  support  referrals  to appropriate levels of care within 12 hours of notification.  (T-1)   46  AFI44-102  17 MARCH 2015 4.18.4.  MTFs  must  ensure  newborn  hearing  screening  is  included  in  routine  newborn screening  (in  compliance  with  local  and  state  mandates  in  the  absence  of  federal requirements). 4.19.  Newborn and Intensive Care Nurseries:  Refer to the most recent edition of Guidelines for  Perinatal  Care  for  functional  capabilities,  physical  plant,  equipment  and  procedures  for intensive care and transfer plans for newborns. 4.20.  Newborn Hospital Stay. 4.20.1.  All  breastfeeding  newborn  infants  shall  be  seen  by  a  pediatrician  or  other knowledgeable  and  experienced  health  care  professional  at  3  to  5  days  of  age  as recommended in the AAP statement Breastfeeding and the Use of Human Milk (2012).  (T-1) 4.20.2.  For  newborns  discharged  less  than  48  hours  after  delivery,  the  PCM  or  attending physician  shall  provide  follow-up  IAW  AAP  statement  Hospital  Stay  for  Healthy  Term Newborns  (2010).    For  newborns  discharged  less  than  48  hours  after  delivery,  an appointment  should  be  made  for  the  infant  to  be  examined  by  a  licensed  health  care professional, preferably within 48 hours of discharge based on risk factors but no later than 72  hours  in  most  cases.  If  this  cannot  be  ensured,  discharge  should  be  deferred  until  a mechanism  for  follow-up  evaluation  is  identified.    Mother  and  infant  shall  be  evaluated individually to determine the optimal time of discharge.  The timing of discharge shall be the decision  of  the  physician  caring  for  the  infant  and  not  by  policy  established  by  third-party payers.  (T-1) AFI44-102  17 MARCH 2015   47  Chapter 5 SURGICAL SERVICES PRODUCT LINE Section 5A—Performing Surgical Procedures 5.1.  Elective Surgery.  Elective (non-emergent) surgery on active duty members performed off-base and not coordinated or approved by the MTF/TRICARE, (such as surgery at the member’s expense), is prohibited without prior written approval of the member's Sq/CC and the MTF/CC.  The  MTF/CC  will  assess  the  risks  and  duty  impact  of  the  proposed  surgery  and  report  this information  to  the  commander,  respecting  the  patient’s  privacy  to  the  extent  practicable.  Permission  must  be  obtained  prior  to  any  non-refundable  deposits  (for  surgery,  airline  tickets, etc.)  being  made;  the  potential  for  lost  deposits  will  not  be  factored  into  the  decision.    In addition, non-emergent elective surgeries within 6 months of separation or retirement must have additional prior approval by HQ AFPC/DPANM, as required IAW AFI 41-210.  (T-1) 5.2.  Cosmetic Surgery. 5.2.1.  Only privileged staff  and residents  in  the specialties of plastic surgery, dermatology, otorhinolaryngology,  ophthalmology,  and  oral-maxillofacial  surgery  may  perform  cosmetic surgery  procedures.    Contract  providers  are  not  to  perform  cosmetic  surgery  procedures.  Civil service providers may perform cosmetic surgery procedures only if they are employed full-time by the MTF with  no other opportunity to maintain their skill  in  cosmetic surgery.  All  patients,  including  active  duty  personnel,  undergoing  cosmetic  surgery  must  pay applicable  fees  for  cosmetic  surgery.    Excluded  from  this  restriction  is  the  excision  or destruction  of  minor  benign  dermatologic  lesions,  which  may  be  performed  by  qualified providers  in  any  specialty.    Waiver  authority  to  this  policy  is  the  AFMOA/CC  for  requests for  supplemental  privileges  for  cosmetic  surgery  procedures  to  other  uniformed  and  civil service specialists, on a case by case basis, providing adequate documentation of training and proficiency is submitted.  (T-1) 5.2.2.  Cosmetic surgery may be performed on a “space-available” basis only, and cosmetic surgery procedures may not exceed 15% of any privileged provider’s caseload. 5.2.3.  All cosmetic procedures will be coded with the proper International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code (current  version).  At present,  the appropriate  ICD-9-CM codes are in the  V50  series:    “Elective  surgery  for  purposes  other  than  remedying  health  status.”    Code V50.1 (ICD-10-CM Z41.1), “Other plastic surgery for unacceptable cosmetic appearance,” is the proper code unless a more specific code exists in this series.  Code V51 (ICD-10-CM Z42 series),  “Aftercare  involving  the  use  of  plastic  surgery  (excludes  cosmetic  plastic  surgery)” may be used to indicate that a procedure is not cosmetic plastic surgery.  (T-1) 5.2.4.  The  MTF/CC  will  establish  a  prepayment  schedule  for  all  patients  and  a  tracking system  for  all  cosmetic  procedures,  IAW  the  annual  publication  of  the  DoD  Medical Reimbursement  Rates  and  Procedures  document.    The  established  tracking  system  shall include  data  elements  to  include  patient  name,  patient  FMP/SS,  surgery  date,  physician name, procedure name, ICD/CPT code, date payment estimated, date paid, amount estimated, actual  codes performed  and additional billing amount.  (T-0, DoD Medical  Reimbursement Rates and Procedures)   48  AFI44-102  17 MARCH 2015 Section 5B—Anesthesia Policy, Practice and Services 5.3.  Responsibilities. 5.3.1.  The  Consultants  to  the  Air  Force  Surgeon  General  for  Anesthesiology  and  Certified Registered  Nurse  Anesthetist  (CRNA),  working  through  AFMOA/SGH  and  AFMOA/SGN provides guidance in force distribution, readiness issues and anesthesiology practice. 5.3.1.1.  Anesthesia is a recognized specialty by both nursing and medicine. 5.3.1.2.  Provision of anesthesia and its related services by Anesthesiologists and CRNAs are  determined  by   Thus,  both Anesthesiologists and CRNAs are recognized as independent practitioners based on their respective  scope  of  practices  and  will  be  held  to  these  standards  in  credentialing  and medico-legal issues.  (T-1) licensure,  certification  and  expertise. their 5.3.1.3.  However,  collaborative  delivery  of  anesthesia  in  a  team  concept,  such  as  the Anesthesia  Care  Team  (ACT),  has  been  shown  to  reduce  mortality  and  morbidity compared to either anesthesia provider acting independently.  Traditionally, ACT referred to  a  CRNA  working  in  a  medical  directed  environment  with  an  Anesthesiologist.  However,  in  the  AFMS,  ACT  refers  to  any  combination  of  Anesthesiologist  or  CRNA working as a team. 5.3.1.4.  Collaboration  is  defined  as  the  collective  determination  to  reach  an  identical objective  (the  best,  safest  patient  outcomes)  and  involves  sharing  knowledge,  learning, and building consensus with mutual respect. 5.3.1.5.  The  ACT  concept,  which  is  collaboration  among  anesthesia  providers  in  the delivery of anesthesia and its related services, will be the preferred practice model in the AFMS and is independent of specific training background.  Most critical to this concept is teamwork with a designated team leader and clearly defined team member roles, both in the overarching organization and in daily operations.  (T-1) 5.3.1.6.  The  anesthesia  team  in  the  AFMS  will  consist  of  a  Chief  of  Anesthesia  who assumes clinical oversight of the anesthesia department, a daily board runner and/or float, and the individual anesthesia provider for each surgical case.  (T-1) 5.3.2.  If anesthesia services are present, the MTF/CC will designate an  anesthesia provider  as  the  Chief  of  Anesthesia  who  is  responsible  for  oversight  of  patient  anesthesia  care  and MTF anesthesia services.  The Chief of Anesthesia must: 5.3.2.1.  Be a privileged anesthesia provider.  (T-1) 5.3.2.2.  Be  the  most  clinically  competent  and  experienced  anesthesia  provider  assigned to the MTF.  It is recommended that MTF/CC or their designee (i.e. SGH, Sq/CC) work in concert with both AF/SG Consultants for Anesthesia in determining the most qualified clinician for this position.  (T-3) 5.3.2.3.  In MTFs with more than 3 Operating Rooms the Chief of Anesthesia will likely be a board certified anesthesiologist.  (T-3) 5.3.2.4.  Ensure all anesthesia providers are actively involved in patient care.  (T-2) AFI44-102  17 MARCH 2015   49  5.3.2.5.  Verify all anesthesia providers are practicing within their full scope of practice.  (T-2) 5.3.2.6.  Develop  a  peer-review  process  to  critically  evaluate  the  delivery  of  anesthesia and its related services on a regular basis.  (T-1) 5.3.2.7.  Provide  regular  feedback,  outcomes,  and  recommendations  on  anesthesia providers and clinical activities to the SGH or other designee.  (T-2) 5.3.2.8.  Provide  daily  assignments  appropriate  for  the  patient’s  condition  and  clinical requirements, and that these needs are coordinated with the Operating Room Supervisor and the attending surgeons.  (T-2) 5.3.2.9.  Certify  that  personnel  develop  a  fail-safe  mechanism  to  track  the  controlled drugs used by anesthesia services.  (T-1) 5.3.2.10.  Ensure  there  is  always  a  back-up  provider  (float)  available  in  the  event  of  an emergency.    The  back-up  provider  must  be  capable  of  immediately  diagnosing  and treating a medical emergency.  (T-1) 5.3.2.11.  The Chief of Anesthesia will also coordinate with the appointed administrator for the Anesthesia Service (Flight/CC or Element Chief) on all matters concerning daily schedules, patient safety and quality, and any other related clinical requirements. 5.3.3.  The MTF/CC will designate an anesthesia provider as the Flight Commander/Element Chief who is responsible for the administrative duties of the anesthesia services.  The Flight Commander/Element Chief must:  (T-1) 5.3.3.1.  Be a privileged anesthesia provider. 5.3.3.2.  Be  responsible  for  all  administrative  duties  for  the  Department  of  Anesthesia, per the MTF guidelines of a Flight Commander/Element Chief. 5.3.3.3.  Support the Chief of Anesthesia in their duties of clinical oversight. 5.3.3.4.  Although  the  Chief  of  Anesthesia  and  Flight  Commander/Element  Chief  could be the same  anesthesia provider due to  limited manpower  resources, it is  recommended that these positions be functionally separate. 5.3.4.  Board Runner and/or Float: 5.3.4.1.  The  designated  anesthesia  board  runner  and/or  float  for  the  daily  schedule  will coordinate all anesthesia activities through the Chief of Anesthesia and Operating Room Supervisor to ensure patient care requirements are met.  (T-1) 5.3.4.2.  One  board  runner/float/back-up  anesthesia  provider  will  be  required  for  every four operating rooms or anesthesia procedures.  (T-1) 5.3.4.3.  The board runner/float responsibilities include ensuring all patients are ready for anesthesia,  coordinating  with  the  operating  room  supervisor  to  execute  the  daily operating  room  schedule,  providing  scheduled  breaks/relief  for  direct  patient  care anesthesia  providers,  carrying  code/emergency/obstetric  care  pagers,  and  responding  to any and all inquiries/consultations/emergencies for the MTF.   50  AFI44-102  17 MARCH 2015 5.3.4.4.  The  functions  and  responsibilities  listed  above  are  a  summary  of  anesthesia clinical practice and are not intended to be all-inclusive.  MTF specific policies should be detailed in anesthesia department OIs in coordination with the AFI. 5.4.  Managing  Controlled  Substances  on  the  Anesthesia  Service.  This section applies only to  MTFs  without  an  automated  storage/delivery  system  in  place.    With  an  automated storage/delivery system in place, the Pharmacy will be responsible for daily supply and re-stock of anesthesia medications.  Automated storage/delivery system units with controlled substances located  outside  the  pharmacy  will  be  physically  inventoried  periodically  according  to  MDG instruction.  Any discrepancies will be immediately investigated and reported to MDG pharmacy leadership.  (T-1) 5.4.1.  In the event of no automated storage/delivery system, the Anesthesia Service: 5.4.1.1.  May keep no more than a one-week supply of controlled substances. 5.4.1.2.  Must  keep  controlled  substances  in  double-locked  cabinets  (may  be  located  on the anesthesia carts as required, or separately).  (T-1) 5.4.2.  The  Chief  of  Anesthesia  appoints  an  anesthesia  provider  as  the  Officer-in-Charge (OIC) of controlled substances in anesthesia. 5.4.3.  A  CRNA  or  anesthesiologist  carries  the  keys  to  the  controlled  substances  cabinets during duty hours. 5.4.3.1.  The on-call anesthesia provider carries the keys after duty hours. 5.4.4.  Personnel must never leave the controlled substances unattended on anesthesia carts.  (T-1) 5.4.5.  The OIC for controlled substances in anesthesia is responsible for a daily inventory of all  controlled  substances.    The  inventory  is  to  be  conducted  by  an  anesthetist  and  another officer who is not an anesthetist. 5.4.6.  Personnel  must  address  appropriate  controlled  substance  dosages  as  part  of  the monthly anesthesia audit.  (T-1) 5.5.  Use of AF Form 579, Controlled Substances Register.  This section applies only to MTFs without a Pyxis, or other automated storage/delivery system in place. 5.5.1.  All  anesthesia  personnel  utilizing  controlled  substances  must  comply  with  the following:  (T-1) 5.5.1.1.  An AF  Form 579 must be maintained for each controlled substance stocked by the anesthesia service. 5.5.1.2.  Controlled substances must be signed out, at the time they are obtained from the cabinet, by the ampule, vial or syringe. 5.5.1.3.  Any unused or unopened ampule, vial, or syringe must be signed back into stock using the received column on AF Form 579. 5.5.1.4.  All controlled substances administered to the patient must be shown in 2 places on the anesthesia record (document the dosage appropriately). AFI44-102  17 MARCH 2015   51  5.5.1.5.  Show  incremental  doses  of  controlled  substances  on  the  anesthesia  record,  and annotate the time given. 5.5.1.6.  Enter  a  summary  of  all  controlled  substances  administered  to  a  patient  and partial  unit  dosages  wasted  on  the  anesthesia  record,  and  on  any  other  local  form  as required.  The anesthesia personnel assigned to the case must sign this summary entry.  If personnel waste, drop, or contaminate partial unit doses, a professionally licensed officer must  co-sign  the  summary  entry.    EXCEPTION:    If  another  professionally  licensed provider or nurse is not available, a medical, surgical or dental journeyman or craftsman may witness and co-sign the entry IAW local policy and procedures. 5.5.1.7.  IDMTs will follow established anesthesia procedures IAW AFI 44-103. 5.5.1.8.  The total amount of controlled substances administered, returned, and destroyed must match the net amount of the drug issued on the AF Form 579. 5.5.1.9.  All  incorrect  balances  and  unaccountable  substances  will  be  reported  to  the SGH, the Chief of Pharmacy Services, or the Chief of Surgical  Services.  An AF Form 765,  Medical  Treatment  Facility  Incident  Statement,  will  be  completed  promptly  and forwarded  to  the  MTF  Risk  Manager.    AF  Form  85,  Controlled  Substance  Inventory Adjustment Voucher, must also be completed. 5.6.  Availability of Anesthetics. 5.6.1.  Anesthesia personnel: 5.6.1.1.  Must have induction agents immediately available.  (T-1) 5.6.1.2.  Control these drugs according to guidelines in Chapter 8, Pharmacy Services of this instruction. 5.6.1.3.

Although personnel must keep an accurate record of incremental doses of drugs administered  on  anesthesia  record,  they  need  not  record  this  type  of  drug  on  AF  Form 579 under usual circumstances.  (T-1) 5.7.  Processing and Completing Records. 5.7.1.  The Anesthesia Provider will: 5.7.1.1.  Establish an anesthetic plan and document this on the anesthesia record.  (T-1) 5.7.1.2.  Write pre-operative orders for the patient on the AF Form 3066, Doctor’s Order or appropriate electronic record in use at that time.  (T-1) 5.7.1.3.  Accompany  the  patient  from  the  procedure  room  to  the  Post-Anesthesia  Care Unit (PACU).  (T-1) 5.7.1.4.  Write  post-operative  orders  for  the  patient  on  the  AF  Form  3066,  Doctor’s Order or appropriate electronic record in use at that time.  (T-1)   52  AFI44-102  17 MARCH 2015 5.7.1.5.  Complete the record at the end of each procedure.  (T-1) 5.7.2.  Procedures performed by anesthesia providers not requiring an anesthesia record shall be documented in the medical record.  (T-1) 5.7.3.  The  PACU  nurse  records  all  pertinent  information  regarding  the  patient’s  recovery from anesthesia.  Local policy will define the parameters used for discharge or transfer.  (T-1) 5.7.4.  The  physiological  parameters  at  the  time  of  the  transfer/discharge  must  be  clearly documented in the patient’s record, along with discharge instructions, and a reference as to in whose care/custody the patient is released.  (T-1) 5.7.5.  The unit nurse receiving the patient makes an entry on the medical record. Section 5C—Use of Sedation for Clinical Procedures 5.8.  Use of Sedation for Clinical Procedures. 5.8.1.  Sedation  is  part  of  the  continuum  of  anesthesia.    Definitions  of  the  three  levels  of sedation are: 5.8.1.1.  Minimal  sedation  (anxiolysis)  is  a  drug-induced  state  during  which  patients respond  normally  to  verbal  commands.    Although  cognitive  function  and  coordination may  be  impaired,  ventilation  and  cardiovascular  function  are  unaffected.    Patient  care areas  providing  minimal  sedation  (anxiolysis)  by  oral  pre-medication  only  may  rely  on standard peer review procedures. 5.8.1.2.  Moderate  sedation/analgesia  (conscious  sedation)  is  a  drug-induced  depression of consciousness during which patients respond purposefully to verbal commands, either alone  or  accompanied  by  light  tactile  stimulation.    No  interventions  are  required  to maintain  a  patent  airway  and  spontaneous  ventilation  is  adequate.    Cardiovascular function is normally maintained. 5.8.1.3.  Deep  sedation/analgesia  is  a  drug-induced  depression  of  consciousness  during which the patient cannot be easily aroused, but responds purposefully following repeated or painful stimulation.  The ability to independently maintain ventilatory function may be impaired.  Patients  may  require  assistance  in  maintaining  a  patent  airway,  and spontaneous  ventilation  may  be  inadequate.    Cardiovascular  function  usually  is maintained. 5.8.2.  Facilities  must  develop  institution-wide  protocols,  with  approval  by  the  Executive Committee  of  the  Medical  Staff  (ECOMS)  for  use  of  sedation  to  ensure  consistency  in  all patient care settings.  (T-1) 5.8.2.1.  This  includes guidance for both  physicians and dentists, defining what  must be included in a pre-sedation history and physical, and when the history and physical is to be performed in relation to the actual surgery.  (T-1) 5.8.3.  Providers appropriately privileged to perform sedation determine the selection and use of  oral  or  intravenous  sedation.    Peer  review,  with  approval  by  the  ECOMS,  of  sedation protocols is required, and will be accomplished IAW the MTF’s program, under the purview of the SGH.  (T-1) AFI44-102  17 MARCH 2015   53  5.8.4.  Medical/Dental  personnel  must  monitor  sedated  patients  and  be  prepared  for emergencies. This requires: 5.8.4.1.  Qualified  assistants.    A  qualified  assistant  must  have  current  BLS  certification (ACLS  or  PALS  training  is  recommended,  depending  on  the  patient’s  age,  but  not required  unless  the  assistant  is  administering  the  medications),  and  familiarity  with  the cardiovascular and respiratory side effects of the agents used.  A qualified assistant must be  trained  in  the  use  of  monitoring  equipment,  be  trained  in  the  recognition  and management of medical emergencies, and be familiar with code blue procedures and the contents of the crash cart.  (T-1) 5.8.4.2.  An emergency notification system.  (T-1) 5.8.4.3.  Monitoring  equipment  for  blood  pressure  determination,  cardiac  rhythm  and oxygen  saturation  will  be  readily  available.    All  sedated  patients  will  be  visually monitored for level of consciousness and respiratory rate.  (T-1) 5.8.4.3.1.  When the patient is minimally sedated (anxiolysis), further monitoring will be provided as deemed necessary by the treating provider (if greater than 50% nitrous oxide is utilized, oxygen saturation and heart rate shall be monitored).  (T-1) 5.8.4.3.2.  When the patient  is  moderately sedated, oxygen saturation, heart rate and blood  pressure  will  be  monitored.    Any  additional  monitoring  may  be  utilized  as deemed necessary for the particular care of an individual patient.  (T-1) 5.8.4.3.3.  When  deep  sedation  is  utilized,  oxygen  saturation,  heart  rate,  blood pressure,  and cardiac rhythm  will be monitored.  Equipment  to  monitor temperature will  be  immediately  available.    Additional  monitoring  may  be  utilized  as  deemed necessary for the particular care of an individual patient.  (T-1) 5.8.4.4.  Resuscitative equipment and medications are rapidly accessible.  (T-1) 5.8.5.  A  privileged  provider  or  qualified  ACLS  and/or  PALS  certified  clinical  nurse  may infuse intravenous medication. 5.8.6.  The  use  of  propofol  should  be  restricted  to  those  trained  in  the  administration  of general  anesthesia when it is  being used for sedation without a definitive airway as per the American Society of Anesthesiologists recommendation. Section 5D—Living Organ and Tissue Donation Participation for Transplantation or Research 5.9.  Organ and Tissue Procurement Planning. 5.9.1.  IAW  DoD  Directive  6465.3,  Organ  and  Tissue  Donation,  all  CONUS  inpatient facilities must establish an organ and tissue procurement plan in conjunction with the nearest military transplant center (MTC) and local organ procurement organization and measure the effectiveness of their organ procurement effort.  This must be documented in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) or a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), which will require local legal review before enactment.  (T-0, DoD Directive 6465.3, Organ and Tissue Donation)   54  AFI44-102  17 MARCH 2015 5.9.2.  Consistent with donor intent, all organs and tissues retrieved from DoD beneficiaries who  had  previously  signed  an  organ  donation  consent  form  are  first  offered  to  one  of  the established MTCs. 5.9.3.  DoD bills  its retrieval  costs to  civilian organ procurement  organizations or non-DoD transplant  recipients  as  outlined  in  the  current  TRICARE  Policy  Manual,  which  can  be accessed at:  http://manuals.tricare.osd.mil/. 5.9.4.  An affirmative or negative organ or tissue donation shown on a DoD-issued card or in a DoD-maintained database shall be considered by medical personnel to  be guidance to the next  of  kin.    If  there  is  conflict  with  State  law,  donor  election  or  donation  documentation, medical personnel may follow local applicable law.  (T-0, DoD Directive 6465.3, Organ and Tissue Donation) 5.9.5.  MTF personnel shall immediately notify the Organ Procurement Organization (OPO) regarding  any  death,  imminent  death  or  when  they  recognize  the  potential  for  organ  and/or tissue donation.  (T-0, DoD Directive 6465.3, Organ and Tissue Donation) 5.9.5.1.  Organ and tissue donation shall be discussed with the next-of-kin in every death in military MTFs unless the potential donor is determined to be medically unsuitable by the OPO or if the patient previously elected not to participate as a donor.  This discussion or determination of unsuitability will be documented in the medical record.  (T-1) 5.9.5.2.  The  MTF  shall  maintain  a  listing  of  patients  who  die  and  record  the  results  of action taken to secure the donation of organs or tissues from each patient who dies.  (T-1) 5.10.  Living Organ and Tissue Donation Participation. 5.10.1.  The DoD encourages, while avoiding coercion, all personnel covered under the DoD health-care  system  to  donate  tissues  and  organs  and  to  advise  their  next  of  kin  about  their decision and any subsequent change in their decision. 5.10.2.  When  an  active  duty  member  wishes  to  be  a  living  organ  or  tissue  donor,  the following process is followed: 5.10.2.1.  The  donor  should  be  made  aware  of  the  risks  and  benefits  of  the  procedure, including  where  complications  might  limit  or  prohibit  further  active  duty  service.    A complete package, as outlined in the next paragraph, should be sent to the MTF/CC for final approval. 5.10.2.2.  The organ donor package should include the following: 5.10.2.2.1.  Letter  from  the  donor  requesting  to  be  an  organ  donor.    The  letter documents the organ to be donated, approximate date of surgery, and – if known – the diagnosis and disease state or current treatment being rendered to the recipient. 5.10.2.2.2.  Letter  from  donor’s  commander  granting  permission  to  be  an  organ donor. 5.10.2.2.3.  Letter  from  donor’s  PCM,  which  documents  that  the  donor  can  be reasonably expected to retain world-wide qualification following donation. AFI44-102  17 MARCH 2015   55  5.10.2.2.4.  Acknowledgement  of  concurrence  from  MTF/SGH  with  attention  to  the ability  of  the  donor’s  MTF  to  provide  care  in  the  case  of  complications  from donation. 5.10.2.3.  Once  the  package  is  complete,  the  MTF/CC  will  review  and  provide  a  final decision back to the requesting donor. 5.10.2.4.  If  the  donor  expects  to  separate  or  retire  within  180  days  of  the  donation, permission will be obtained from AFPC/DPANM and this memorandum will be included in the approval package.  (T-1) 5.10.2.5.  The  donor  will  seek  guidance  and  be  informed  of  their  health  benefits  and limitations  by  their  TRICARE  service  benefits  representative.    Verification  of  this consultation will be incorporated in the approval package.  (T-1) 5.10.3.  The  time  allotted  for  an  active  duty  member  to  serve  as  an  organ  donor  will  vary based on the procedure required. 5.10.3.1.  AFI 36-3003, Military Leave Program, Table 7, Rule 36, allows the member’s commander to approve up to 10 days of permissive TDY if the unit mission allows. 5.10.3.2.  When the donor is admitted to the inpatient service, they are placed in inpatient status. 5.10.3.3.  The donor will be placed on convalescent leave IAW military medical authority for an appropriate period of time after the procedure.  (T-1) 5.10.4.  AF participants in the DoD Marrow Donor Program will follow the same process as other organ donors; the DoD program command permission letters meet the requirement for documenting command permission.  (T-1) 5.10.5.  Donation of peripheral blood cells is exempt from this process. 5.10.6.  Post-Mortem Sperm Donation. 5.10.6.1.  MTF/CC shall ascertain whether post-mortem sperm collection is offered in the local  community,  and  if  so,  shall  generate  an  MOU  or  MOA  to  delineate  the administrative  process  for  accomplishing  the  sperm  collection.    If  this  procedure  is  not offered locally, the MTF/CC has no further obligation to locate such services.  (T-1) 5.10.6.2.  If  an  individual  seeks  post-mortem  collection  of  sperm  from  a  deceased  AF member,  the  MTF/CC  must  determine  if  there  are  stipulations,  in  writing,  by  the deceased  service  member,  that  the  deceased  member  has  consented  to  the  collection  of sperm  for the purpose of procreation, and has specifically identified the recipient of the sperm as the individual seeking the sperm.  (T-1) 5.10.6.3.  All  costs  associated  with  collection,  transport,  storage  and  subsequent  use  of the sperm will be borne by the requesting individual.  (T-1)   56  AFI44-102  17 MARCH 2015 CLINICAL LABORATORY AND ANATOMIC PATHOLOGY SERVICES Chapter 6 Section 6A—General Guidance 6.1.  General Guidance. 6.1.1.  Each MTF follows DoD standards of laboratory practice defined in the DoD Clinical Laboratory  Improvement  Program  (DoD  CLIP)  for  registration,  certification,  proficiency testing,  patient  test  management,  quality  control,  personnel,  quality  improvement  and inspection.  Each MTF ensures that laboratories are inspected and accredited by the College of  American  Pathologists  (CAP),  the  Joint  Commission  or  other  accreditation  programs approved  by  the  Office  of  the  Secretary  of  Defense,  Health  Affairs.    Transfusion  Services and Blood Donor Centers will be accredited by the AABB and registered with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  (T-0, DoDI 6440.2, Clinical Laboratory Improvement Program (CLIP)) 6.1.2.  Each MTF prepares a laboratory guide with: 6.1.2.1.  A list of specific services and procedures it provides. 6.1.2.2.  Specific instructions covering specimen requests and submission instructions. 6.2.  Laboratory Services. 6.2.1.  The MTF/CC designates a Chief or Flight Commander, Laboratory Services.  In most cases, this will be a biomedical laboratory officer.  If a laboratory officer is not assigned to the  facility,  a  qualified  medical  director,  trained  IAW  DoD  CLIP  and  CAP  requirements, may assume the additional duty of Chief, Laboratory Services.  (T-0, DoDI 6440.2) 6.2.2.  The MTF/CC designates a Medical Director.  The MTF/CC appoints a staff physician trained IAW DoD CLIP and CAP requirements as medical director in situations where there is no assigned pathologist. 6.2.2.1.  If the MTF does not have a staff physician that meets the DoD CLIP  and CAP Medical  Director  education  and  experience  requirements,  the  MTF  will  consult  with AF/SG Pathology Consultant to assign a pathologist from a regional MTF as the medical director  or  pathology  consultant.    A  civilian  medical  director  or  pathology  consultant outside DoD will be locally funded.  (T-0, DoDI 6440.2) Section 6B—Blood Transfusion Services 6.3.  Transfusion Services/Blood Donor Centers (BDC). 6.3.1.  The  laboratory  chief  ensures  the  transfusion  service  or  blood  donor  center  operates under  the  control  of  a  trained,  competent  and  experienced  staff.    Compatibility  testing procedures shall adequately safeguard the intended recipient.  (T-1) 6.3.2.  The  operation  shall  conform  to  military  directives  and  current  Good  Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) as required by the FDA, AFI 44-105, The Air Force Blood Program, and AFI44-102  17 MARCH 2015   57  guidance  from  AFMOA  to  include  the  Air  Force  Blood  Program  Division.    (T-0,  FDA regulations) 6.3.3.  Patients, or their guardians in the case of minors, who expect to receive blood product transfusions  shall  complete  AF  Form  1225,  Informed  Consent  for  Blood  Transfusion,  or suitable  substitute/local  form.    This  form  documents  the  discussion  between  patient  and provider  regarding  the  risks  and  benefits  associated  with  blood  transfusions  as  well  as  the alternatives  to  receiving  allogeneic  blood.    Also  see  paragraph  2.5.,  Informed  Consent Documentation and Section 2C,  Treating  Minors; paragraph 2.7.,  General  Guidelines of this instruction.  (T-1) 6.3.4.  The  administration  of  blood  products  is  documented  on  SF  518,  Blood  or  Blood Component  Transfusion  Medical  Record,  or  suitable  substitute/local  form  to  permanently capture  all  events  and  essential  patient  information  associated  with  blood  product administration.    When  the  blood  product  is  known  to  be  non-US,  non-  FDA  licensed,  the transfusion service/ blood bank shall annotate the status of that product in the Remarks block of  Section  II.    The  annotation  will  state:    “Non-US,  non-FDA  licensed  product,  patient follow-up testing is required.”  (T-1) 6.4.  Blood Transfusion Follow-up for Products from Non-FDA sites. 6.4.1.  DoD healthcare policy requires that beneficiaries receive medical treatment that meets or exceeds the established "standard  of care."  In regard to blood transfusion, this means that all  transfused  blood  products  must  be  FDA-compliant.    Since  U.S.  personnel  are  deployed around  the  world  and  banked  blood  is  perishable,  it  is  not  always  possible  to  provide transfusion  centers  with  FDA-compliant  blood  products.    The  use  of  non-FDA-compliant blood  is  sometimes  necessary  to  save  lives  and  may  be  the  only  alternative  during  combat operations or mass casualty events.  (T-0, HA Policy 10-002, Policy On the Use of Non-U.S. Food and Drug Administration Compliant Blood Products) 6.4.2.  Blood products from non-FDA registered blood banks/blood services may be used in DoD MTFs only when absolutely necessary for emergent treatment. 6.4.2.1.  Examples  of  non-FDA  registered  blood  banks/blood  services  include  blood products  collected by a  “host nation” (foreign  country) and provided to  a DoD MTF or forward  deployed  EMEDS  facility,  blood  collected  under  emergency  conditions  and transfused before FDA-approved blood donor tests are completed, or blood products that are transfused in a “host nation” (civilian or military) hospital. 6.4.2.2.  Under  such  circumstances  the  attending  physician  or  PCM  (at  DoD  MTF)  will verify  and  document  in  the  electronic  medical  record  the  use  of  non-FDA  compliant blood products and notify Public Health.  Follow-up testing is required.  (T-0, HA Policy 10-002)    NOTE:    Recipients  of  blood  products  from  Armed  Services  Blood  Program Office-determined equivalent countries are exempted from these requirements.  (T-0, HA Policy  11-008,  Policy  on  the  Establishment  of  Comparability  of  Foreign  Nation  Blood Supplies to Food and Drug Administration Compliant Blood Products) 6.4.3.  To the maximum extent feasible, a pre-transfusion  blood specimen will be collected to establish a baseline for each of the current FDA-required  blood donor infectious disease screening  tests.    If  a  pre-transfusion  specimen  cannot  be  obtained,  a  baseline  blood  sample should be collected as soon as possible post-transfusion.  (T-0, HA Policy 10-002)   58  AFI44-102  17 MARCH 2015 6.4.4.  Each MTF will establish a process to ensure retesting of these patients at 3 months, 6 months,  and  1-year  post  transfusion.    Use  of  a  patient  tracking  system  such  as  the  Patient Tracking Module in ASIMS is encouraged.  All testing will be completed and documented in the patient’s electronic medical record as soon as practical.  If the patient will not remain at the  same  location  to  finish  required  testing,  then  the  losing  MTF  must  have  a  process  to coordinate with the gaining MTF to ensure appropriate transfer of care.  (T-0, HA Policy 10-002) 6.4.4.1.  Patient  follow-up  also  applies  to  U.S.  patients  transfused  with  non-FDA compliant  blood  given  by  host-nation  healthcare  facilities.    As  stated  above,  some countries are exempt from this requirement IAW HA Policy 11-008. 6.4.5.  The patient will be given notice, prior to transfusion if feasible or as soon thereafter as possible,  that  the  blood  is  not  FDA-compliant,  the  reasons  it  is  being  provided,  and  the necessary patient follow-up.  (T-0, HA Policy 10-002) 6.4.6.  These guidelines not only apply to DoD beneficiaries stationed at established overseas bases, but to all deployed personnel in operational theaters to include Reservists and National Guardsmen.    Proper  follow-up  care  will  continue  following  demobilization,  separation  and retirement from military duty. 6.4.7.  Each  transfusion  of  a  non-FDA  compliant  blood  product  will  be  reported  to  the appropriate  geographic  AF  MAJCOM,  Unified  or  Specified  Command,  or  Task  Force Surgeon’s office, who in turn, will forward data to the Armed Services Blood Program Office (ASBPO)  and  the  appropriate  Service  Blood  Program  Office  through  the  Joint  Blood Program Office.  (T-0, HA Policy 10-002) Section 6C—Anatomic Pathology Services 6.5.  Anatomic Pathology Services. 6.5.1.  All MTFs without in-house anatomic pathology services will consult with the AF/SG Pathology Consultant to coordinate anatomic pathology services.  (T-1) 6.5.2.  The  MTF/CC  coordinates  with  the  AF/SG  Pathology  Consultant  for  cytopathology services.    All  gynecologic  cytology  specimens  will  be  referred  to  59  MDW/SAMMC  per AF/SG 2005 AF Cytology Center consolidation.  (T-1) 6.5.3.  Histopathology  and cytopathology cases requiring consultation  (second opinion) will be  coordinated  with  the  Joint  Pathology  Center  Washington  D.C.  or  another  DoD  MTF.  Histopathology  or  cytopathology  consultations  referred  outside  of  DoD  will  be  locally funded.  (T-1) AFI44-102  17 MARCH 2015   59  Chapter 7 RADIOLOGY AND RADIOLOGIC SERVICES Section 7A—Radiology Administration 7.1.  Filing Hard Copy Radiographs.  All medical non-digital (hard copy) radiographs taken in any MTF, or forwarded from other facilities will be filed in AF Form 2700, Radiographic Film Envelope.    Dental  Radiographs  will  be  handled  in  accordance  with  AFI  47-101,  Managing  Air Force Dental Services.  (T-1) 7.2.  Radiology Technicians. 7.2.1.  Must  complete  a  locally  developed,  formal,  documented,  skill-verification  training program  before  administering  intravenous  contrast  media.    This  will  be  documented  in  the electronic Air Force Training Record.  (T-2) 7.2.2.  After  appropriate  training,  technicians  may  inject  contrast  media  only  under  the direction of a physician who is immediately available. 7.2.3.  The  person  responsible  for  the  injection,  who  may  be  a  technologist  or  registered nurse, must be aware of the signs and symptoms of an adverse effect  and must monitor the patient  for  the  development  of  these  signs  and  symptoms  during  the  examination.    The supervising  physician,  or  his  or  her  physician  designee,  must  be  immediately  available  to respond promptly to an adverse effect.  (T-1) 7.3.  Stat Examinations, Early Interpretation and Critical Results Communication:  Will be guided  by  the  American  College  of  Radiology  Standard  for  Communication:    Diagnostic Radiology  and  The  Joint  Commission  guidance  on  critical  results  notification.    There  is considerable  overlap  and  MTFs  must  be  cognizant  of  the  fact  that  stat  performance  and  stat interpretation,  “wet  read,”  are  not  the  same  thing.    Critical  communication  of  findings  is independent  of  requested  urgency  of  interpretation  and  takes  urgency  from  the  interpretation itself.  (T-0, ACR Standard for Communication, TJC) 7.3.1.  Urgent Examinations:  When ordered “stat” either electronically or in writing, should be conducted as soon as can be arranged (immediately, or as soon as resources can be made available). 7.3.2.  Early Interpretation:  Interpretation without delay is required when the requesting provider annotates “Wet Read,” or when the priority for the study is classified as “stat (immediate),” “ASAP (as soon as possible),” or “notify” in the written or electronic order for Radiologic Consultation Request/Report.  Where and when applicable, work list prioritization in the Picture Archiving and Communication (PACS) and Teleradiology Systems should be set up to force these examinations to the front of workflow. 7.3.3.  The radiologist providing a preliminary interpretation when contacted or requested by the referring provider will document such communication in  the final  radiological  report in lieu of an immediate final report.  (T-1)   60  AFI44-102  17 MARCH 2015 7.3.4.  Critical  Results:   Unexpected  and  serious  abnormalities  must  also  be  reported  to  the requesting  provider  as  soon  as  possible  after  identification  by  the  radiologist.    This notification  shall  be  documented  in  the  final  radiological  report.    A  critical  results  list  and procedures for notification must be established for each facility and each must have a means of tracking request and notification times for these procedures, something that is not native to CHCS, nor inherent in some PACS.  (T-1) 7.4.  Completion of Reports. 7.4.1.  The final report is considered to be the definitive means of communicating the results of  an  imaging  examination  to  the  referring  provider.    The  timeliness  of  reporting  any radiological  examination  varies  with  the  nature  and  urgency  of  the  clinical  problem.  However, to the degree possible, final typed reports shall be completed and available to the referring  provider  within  3  working  days  from  completion  of  the  examination  in  facilities with full-time military or civilian radiologists.  Mechanisms to speed report turn-around time should  be  viewed  as  essential  to  excellent  patient  care  and  may  require  ancillary  personnel and  technology  support.    At  remote  or  solitary  staffed  facilities,  mechanisms  should  be  in place for local  or teleradiology interpretation  of  urgent  examinations.   Routine examination may often be handled in the same way, but a temporary extension for local interpretation of routine examinations may sometimes be appropriate.  (T-1) 7.5.  Film Loaning and Transfer. 7.5.1.  Films, or copies of original films, may be temporarily loaned or transferred to another MTF.  All  digitally archived completed examinations are locally  available at  all AF MTFs, minimizing need for such distribution. 7.5.2.  Where  appropriate,  personnel  at  the  originating  facility  maintain  AF  Form  614, Charge  Out  Record,  in  place  of  the  original  file  film  envelope.    Electronic  charge-out processes are also acceptable.  This is unnecessary when a copy is made on electronic media. 7.5.3.  If  a  hard  copy  film  file  is  permanently  transferred  to  another  medical  facility, personnel retire the original envelope or AF Form 614, with any film files being retired that year. 7.5.4.  Film  and  electronic  media  may  be  hand-carried  by  the  patient  by  order  of  the attending provider. 7.5.5.  Patients  may  hand-carry  original  mammography  film  or  electronic  copy  (when digital), have them sent to a new facility, or request that they be forwarded after the patient’s arrival at the new MTF, IAW paragraph 4.2.6. of this instruction.  Copies of mammography film should be used for comparison only by exception. 7.6.  Contract Employees’ X-Ray Films. 7.6.1.  X-Rays taken of contract  employees during their period of employment or as part of their  termination  examinations  become  part  of  the  employment  records,  as  stated  in  the employment agreement. AFI44-102  17 MARCH 2015   61  Section 7B—Teleradiology 7.7.  Teleradiology.  Teleradiology  is  an  evolving  endeavor  that  will  eventually  result  in  the connection  of  all  sites  in  the  AFMS  for  the  purpose  of  interpretation/comparison  of  images.  Studies  may  be  interpreted  by  any  credentialed  radiologist  in  the  AFMS.    The  practice  of teleradiology is currently conducted between individual sites.  Further teleradiology guidance is forthcoming  in  an  update  to  this  instruction  prior  to  additional  changes  brought  about  by  the upcoming connection.   62  AFI44-102  17 MARCH 2015 Chapter 8 PHARMACY SERVICES Section 8A—Pharmacy Services 8.1.

(T-1) 8.4.1.3.  Providers  dispensing  medications  outside  of  the  pharmacy,  i.e.    after-hours clinics,  will  annotate  the  medication  dispensed  on  the  patient’s  SF  600,  or  SF  603, Medical  Record-Dental,  SF  558,  Emergency  Care  and  Treatment,  or  in  the  electronic medical record.  Also see paragraph 8.22., Force Health Protection Prescription Products of this instruction.  (T-1) 8.4.2.  Patients may authorize adult third parties to pick up their prescriptions.  An individual acting  as  the  patient’s  representative  can  pick  up  a  prescription  for  the  patient  under  the following circumstances. 8.4.2.1.  The patient has identified, either verbally or in writing, a family member, other relative, personal friend or any other person authorized to pick up prescriptions, or 8.4.2.2.  If  the  patient  is  not  present  to  give  consent,  the  health  care  provider  may  use professional  judgment  to  determine  if  it  is  in  that  patient’s  best  interest  to  provide  the prescription to the patient’s representative. 8.4.2.3.  Public  Law  104-191,  Health  Insurance  Portability  and  Accountability  Act  of 1996  (HIPAA)  regulations  specifically  permit  the  conveyance  of  protected  health information  to  the  patient’s  representative  when  they  are  picking  up  medications  for  a   64  AFI44-102  17 MARCH 2015 patient.  Pharmacy personnel are permitted to and shall provide any necessary counsel to the representative regarding the medication or its safe administration to the patient.  (T-0, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996) 8.4.3.  Dispensing to inpatient/institutional care facilities outside the MTF is not authorized.  Inpatient and institutional care facilities must have pharmacy services available.  The MTF is not able to meet labeling and packaging requirements for other facilities.  This does not apply to mutual aid situations at the discretion of the Pharmacy Officer and MTF/CC.  (T-1) 8.4.4.  Pharmacies  may  not  curtail  or  withdraw  civilian  prescription  service,  nor  restrict formulary drugs to any beneficiary class, regardless of the source of the prescription.  NOTE:  Limiting drug availability to specific patients is acceptable when the limitations are based on clinical  considerations,  such  as  efficacy  and/or  potential  toxicity.    Such  limitations  shall  be accomplished  using  published  disease  management  guidelines,  or those  developed cooperatively between members of the medical staff and the pharmacy.  (T-1) 8.4.5.  Over-the-counter (OTC) medication programs  are permitted as long as the following conditions are met:  Medications are included on the MTF formulary (i.e., the P&T Function determines  them  to  be  cost-effective  alternatives  to  prescription  products);  the  OTC medication  program  functions  under  the  supervision  of  providers;  medications  are  entered into  CHCS/AHLTA;  and,  the  medications  are  dispensed  through  the  MTF  pharmacy.  OTC medication  "hand-out"  programs  at  MTF  pharmacies  without  the  above  supervision  or controls  to  ensure  patient  safety  are  specifically  prohibited.    (T-1)    EXCEPTION:    See paragraph  8.4.6.  of  this  instruction  for  guidance  regarding  FDA-approved  emergency contraceptive agents. 8.4.6.  Emergency Contraception.  MTF/CCs will implement procedures to ensure that FDA-approved emergency contraceptive agents will be ordered, stored, dispensed, distributed, and accounted for IAW this AFI.

MTF  Emergency  Department  (ED). emergency  contraceptive  medications  must  be  under  the  supervision  of  a  privileged medical provider and IAW with local MTF policy.  (T-0, TJC Standard) AFI44-102  17 MARCH 2015   65  8.4.6.6.  Medical  personnel  who  object to  dispensing  emergency  contraceptive medications  or  engaging  in  family  planning  services  for  moral,  ethical,  religious, personal,  or  professional  reasons  will  not  be  required  to  engage  or  assist  in  such procedures  unless  the  refusal  poses  a  life-threatening  risk  to  the  patient.    However,  the MTF/CC  must  ensure  alternate  arrangements  are  available  for  the  patient  to  obtain  the medication with no delay in care.  (T-1) 8.4.7.  Active duty members are prohibited from obtaining medications, or using medications obtained  from  an  Internet  pharmacy  not  related  to  the  TRICARE  Pharmacy  benefit.  The Pharmacy benefit supplies medications through an MTF, a participating civilian pharmacy or through the DoD TRICARE Mail Order Pharmacy (TMOP) Program. Section 8D—Formulary Management 8.5.  Use of Formulary Drugs and Non-Formulary Requests. 8.5.1.  The  pharmacy  will  maintain  a  formulary  that  lists  drugs  and  pharmaceutical preparations  approved the Pharmacoeconomic Center basic core formulary list.  (T-2) the  P&T  Function,  and/or  by for  prescription  by 8.5.2.  Pharmacies  and  prescribing  providers  must  use  formulary  drugs  wherever  possible.  The  drugs  in  the  therapeutic  classes  represented  on  the  DoD  Basic  Core  Formulary  (BCF) must be the first line agents at all MTFs.  The MTF may supplement therapeutic classes on the BCF with other second line agents to meet patient needs.  The MTF may include drugs on their formularies in therapeutic classes not represented on the BCF.  (T-2) 8.5.3.  Pharmacies need not honor prescriptions from non-referral medical facilities for drugs not on the formulary. 8.5.4.  Non-formulary  Requests:    The  MTF  will  have  a  written  policy  for  requesting, processing,  and  filling  non-formulary  drugs.    The  process  must  include  the  provider documenting the request and then review and approval by a pharmacist.  Documentation may be accomplished via e-mail, locally generated form, or DD Form 2081,  New Drug Request, an  equivalent  form  or  equivalent  computer-generated  means  via  an  AF-approved  system (e.g., AHLTA note).  If using the DD Form 2081, the sections marked “For Completion by the Chief of Department” and “For Completion by Therapeutic Agents Board” are optional.  The  intent  is  that  the  provider  substantiates  the  need  for  a  non-formulary  medication,  the pharmacist  agrees,  and  the  P&T  Function  reviews  aggregate  non-formulary  requests.    The goal should be a streamlined process where patients receive their medication within 24 to 48 hours of provider’s request.  (T-1) 8.5.5.  The  pharmacy  will  submit  a  summary  of  non-formulary  approvals  to  the  P&T Function  at  each  meeting.    Frequent  requests  for  a  non-formulary  drug  shall  prompt consideration for addition to the MTF formulary.  (T-2) 8.5.6.  When MTF enrolled patients are seen at a referral facility and prescribed medications that  are  not  on  the  formulary  at  the  MTF,  the  MTF  pharmacy  will  utilize  their  established non-formulary  request  process  to  obtain  the  non-formulary  medications  for  the  patient.  Referral  MTFs  must  provide  patients  with  at  least  a  reasonable  supply  of  medication  when recommending long-term therapy, to allow the local MTF time to procure the non-formulary   66  AFI44-102  17 MARCH 2015 medication.    Referral  from  civilian  facilities  may  require  purchase  in  a  civilian  pharmacy until the medication can be obtained by the MTF.  (T-1) 8.6.  Air Force High Dollar Drug Program. 8.6.1.  The  local  MTF  arranges  for  or  provides  medications  to  treat  conditions  such  as immunodeficiency  diseases,  transplants  and  other  rare  conditions.    NOTE:    In  situations  in which  the  cost  to  the  MTF  exceeds  $500  per  patient  per  month,  the  Air Force  High  Dollar Drug Program at Wright-Patterson AFB may be utilized. 8.7.  Generic Medication. 8.7.1.  Pharmacies  may  fill  prescriptions  written  by  DoD  providers  for  brand-name  drugs with an FDA approved generic equivalent when available. 8.7.2.  Pharmacies  must  fill  clinically  appropriate  and  otherwise  legal  prescriptions  for formulary  drugs  written  by  civilian  providers  for  eligible  beneficiaries.    Substitution  of generic  for  brand-name  products  on  prescriptions  from  non-MTF  providers  follows applicable state pharmacy  practice  guidelines.   Pharmacies will not  special purchase brand-name drugs to fill civilian prescriptions.  (T-0, FY1994 National Defense Authorization Act and subsequent legislation) Section 8E—Pharmacy and Therapeutics Function 8.8.  The Pharmacy and Therapeutics Function. 8.8.1.
