Adherence.  Strict  adherence to  Open Skies Treaty (OST) requirements and maximization of standard operating procedures for Open Skies activities and missions is paramount. 1.2.  Manpower and Reserve Affairs.  The Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Manpower and Reserve Affairs provides guidance, direction, and oversight for the United States Air Force (USAF) in support of the USAF OST program. 1.3.  Review  Guidance.  AF/A10S  reviews  this  document  on  a  biennial  basis  and  updates  as necessary.  6 AFI16-604  31 MAY 2016 Chapter 2 OVERVIEW 2.1.  General 2.1.1.  This  guidance  articulates  USAF  processes,  provides  procedural  guidance,  and specifies  Headquarters  USAF,  MAJCOMs,  and  unit  responsibilities  for  implementation  of and  compliance  with  the  OST.    It  also  provides  direction  and  planning  factors  for implementing the OST. 2.1.2.  This guidance provides implementation direction for USAF activities in support of the OST mission, including coordination and scheduling of missions; initiative development and coordination;  training;  financial  oversight;  Service  representation  in  OST  working  groups;, utilization  of  USAF  assets  and  personnel;  and  input  into  the  U.S.  Open Skies  platform  and related  hardware  choices.    It  also  spells  out  U.S.  Government  (USG)  and  USAF organizational responsibilities. 2.1.3.  All U.S. forces within the territory of an OST signatory (includes all U.S. territory and many  European  countries,  reference  paragraph  2.3.1.)  are  vulnerable  to  overflight  during OST observation missions in accordance with the OST.   Presidential Policy Directive (PPD) 15,  Implementation  of  the  Treaty  on  Open  Skies,  governs  USG  implementation  of  and compliance  with  the  OST.  PPD  15  is  a  classified  document  and  may  be  obtained  from AF/A10S. 2.1.4.  This  guidance  is  designed  to  be  a  basic  reference  and  information  resource  to  Air Force personnel involved with OST implementation. 2.1.5.  USAF facilities/forces directly impacted by the OST include those designated as Open Skies Points of Entry/Exit (POE/POX), Open Skies Airfields (OSA), Open Skies Refueling Airfields  (OSRA),  Open  Skies  Gateways,  transit  airfields,  and  the  Open  Skies  Media Processing  Facilities  (OSMPF).    The  OST  also  directly  impacts  the  base  and  maintenance facilities for the OC-135B aircraft fleet. 2.1.6.  Affected  MAJCOMs  (see  Paragraph  4.1.5.)  will  develop  implementation  plans  and procedures to execute this guidance. 2.2.  Introduction 2.2.1.  The  Eisenhower  Administration  originally  proposed  an  Open  Skies  regime  in  1955.  Eisenhower's  Open  Skies  regime,  presented  to  the  Soviets  during  the  Geneva  Summit  in Switzerland,  was  a  bilateral  initiative  that  sought  to  protect  against  a  nuclear  attack  by superior forces.  At the height of the Cold War, the Soviets found this initiative unacceptable. 2.2.2.  With  a  decline  in  superpower  tensions,  President  George  H.  W.  Bush  revived  the Open Skies concept in 1989.  Negotiations between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and former Warsaw Pact nations to formulate a treaty began in Ottawa, Canada, in February  1990,  and  continued  in  Budapest,  Hungary,  in  April  1990.    However,  these  talks reached  no  conclusive  agreement.  With  the  failed  Soviet  coup  in  Moscow,  Russian Federation,  and  the  subsequent  changes  it  brought,  the  collapsing  Soviet  Union  agreed  to open  its  territory  to  aerial  observation.    Negotiations  resumed  in  Vienna,  Austria,  in  AFI16-604  31 MAY 2016 7 November 1991, and the multi-national OST was signed in  Helsinki, Finland, on 24 March 1992. 2.2.3.  Within  the  framework  of  the  Organization  for  Security  and  Cooperation  in  Europe (OSCE),  the  goal  of  the  OST  is  to  strengthen  peace,  stability,  and  cooperative  security  by promoting  openness  and  transparency  of  military  forces  and  activities.    The  Treaty establishes  a  regime  of  aerial  observations  of  the  signatories'  territory  in  order  to  gather information  about  military  forces  and  activities.  By  establishing  this  regime  of  observation flights, the Treaty seeks to increase confidence and security among its signatories, facilitate verification of other arms control agreements, and provide information for crisis management and conflict prevention. 2.2.4.  Overflight of OST states by observing Party aircraft equipped with Treaty-compliant sensors  is  the  focal  point  of  the  Treaty’s  confidence  and  security  building  regime.    As  a result,  the  entire  U.S.  sovereign  territory  and  U.S.  assets  in  any  OST  State  Party  are susceptible to imaging from Open Skies aircraft during observation flights. 2.2.5.  Six  months  after  entry-into-force  (EIF)  the  treaty  was  opened  to  accession  by  any interested  State,  subject  to  consensus  by  the  current  signatories  in  the  Open  Skies Consultative Commission (OSCC).  The OST is not restricted geographically. 2.2.6.  Observation  and  demonstration  flights  may  be  flown  over  the  entire  territory  of  all signatories and take priority over regular air traffic.  For the U.S. this scenario is covered in Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Order 7110.65W,  Air Traffic Control, paragraph 9-2-22.  Transit flights are not covered by this FAA Order.  Once the flight plan is agreed upon, only flight safety considerations may restrict the conduct of observation flights. 2.2.7.  The  OST  entered-into-force  on  1  January  2002.   Three  years  of  phased implementation  followed  during  which  no  more  than  75%  of  the  quota  allocation  could  be conducted  (see  paragraph  2.4).    The  OST  entered  into  full  implementation  on  1  January 2006. 2.3.  Participating States Parties 2.3.1.  States party to the OST as of 1 January 2016:  8 AFI16-604  31 MAY 2016 Figure 2.1.

DoD personnel  perform  duties  as  senior  United  States  Government  representatives  during  active Open  Skies  Treaty  missions  over  Treaty  partner  countries  and  during  passive  Open  Skies missions over sovereign U.S. territory. 3.1.2.  The  Undersecretary  of  Defense  for  Policy  (USD(P))  is  responsible  for  overall coordination  of  policy  for  DoD  involvement  in  the  OST  and  represents  the  Secretary  of Defense  on  OST  matters  in  the  Interagency  process  involving  other  Federal  agencies  and other OST parties. (DoDD 2060.1) for  Acquisition,  Technology  &  Logistics 3.1.3.  The  Undersecretary  of  Defense (USD(AT&L)) is responsible for oversight of DoD implementation of, and compliance with, arms  control  agreements,  including  the  OST.    The  Deputy  Director,  Treaty  Compliance OUSD(AT&L)/A/SSI/SS&TC serves as the Treaty Manager for the OST.  (DoDD 2060.1) 3.1.4.  The  DOD  Open  Skies  Implementation  Working  Group  (OSIWG)  monitors  and coordinates  DOD  implementation  activities.    USD(AT&L)  Memo,  Implementation  of,  and Compliance  with,  the  Open  Skies  Treaty,  and  SOP  07-01:  Charter:  Open  Skies Implementation Working Group (OSIWG) are the guiding documents for OSIWG activities.  Copies of these documents may be obtained from AF/A10S. 3.1.5.  The  DoD  Open  Skies  High  Value  Activities  Group  (HVAG)  convenes  under  the Chairmanship of the OUSD(AT&L)/A/SSI/SS&TC Treaty Manager, to address activities that may  impact,  or  be  impacted  by  an  observation  flight  over  the  U.S.    (High  Value  Activity (HVA) reporting is addressed in Paragraph 6.3. and SOP 05-02: High Value Activities (HVA) Notification Procedures.)  Copies of this document may be obtained from AF/A10S. 3.1.6.

Major Command (MAJCOM) Treaty Officer Responsibilities 4.1.1.  MAJCOM  arms  control  duties  and  responsibilities  are  derived  from  AF  Policy Directive 16-6, AFI 16-601, and AFI 16-603. 4.1.2.  Each  MAJCOM  ensures  its  subordinate  installations  fulfill  their  arms  control implementation  and  compliance  requirements.  Specifically,  AFIs  16-601  and  16-603 mandate that MAJCOMs will: 4.1.2.1.  Establish an arms control office or point of contact to address applicable treaties and agreements; 4.1.2.2.  Ensure  that  personnel  involved  with  arms  control  activities  receive  education and training; and 4.1.2.3.  Conduct overall arms control implementation in their command. 4.1.3.  MAJCOM  Treaty  Officers  play  a  crucial  role  ensuring  the  Air  Force  meets  its  arms control  obligations.  They  provide  a  critical  link  between  subordinate  installations,  the MAJCOM,  and  the  Air  Staff.  Their  responsibilities  include  compliance  with  guidance, compliance  planning,  liaison,  training,  and  resource  management.    Information  on  these specific responsibilities is provided in the paragraphs below. 4.1.4.  Duties 4.1.4.1.  Compliance  Guidance.    Develop  and  coordinate  compliance  guidance  for subordinate Wings and Units. 4.1.4.2.  Review  and  coordinate  on  higher  headquarters  Directives  and  Instructions.  MAJCOM Treaty Officers will participate in the review and coordination of arms control implementation, compliance, and guidance. They will staff higher headquarters taskers to all  pertinent  organizations  and  provide  a  consolidated  MAJCOM  response  when requested. 4.1.4.3.  Implement Arms Control Guidance.  MAJCOM Treaty Officers are responsible for  ensuring  subordinate  installations  implement  DoD,  Higher  Headquarters,  and MAJCOM policies to ensure compliance with arms control treaties and agreements, thus ensuring consistent application of guidance across MAJCOMs and at the base level. 4.1.5.  MAJCOM Open Skies Treaty Compliance Plans 4.1.5.1.  MAJCOM  Treaty  Officers  will  develop  MAJCOM-level  Open  Skies  Treaty Compliance  Plans  to  ensure  standardized  compliance  procedures  throughout  their MAJCOM.    MAJCOM  Treaty  Officers  will  ensure  the  MAJCOM  Open  Skies Compliance Plans comply with and complement guidance issued by higher headquarters, the DoD, and the USG.  In addition, ensure the MAJCOM Open Skies Compliance Plans define procedures for adherence to the OST and articulate overall MAJCOM guidance in order  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  OST.    (Note:  The  requirement  to  develop  a MAJCOM  OST Compliance  Plan  is  only  applicable  to  those  MAJCOMs  having  within  28 AFI16-604  31 MAY 2016 their infrastructure, installations designated to support OST activities (i.e., AFMC, ACC, AMC, PACAF and USAFE). 4.1.5.2.  MAJCOM Treaty Officers will ensure MAJCOM Open Skies Compliance Plans address all subordinate installations that are affected by OST operations and observation activities. 4.1.5.3.  MAJCOM Treaty Officers will ensure MAJCOM Open Skies Compliance Plans define  applicable  rules/directives  and  task  affected  installations  to  support  treaty requirements.  In addition, MAJCOM Treaty Officers are responsible for maintaining and reviewing subordinate installation compliance plans. 4.1.6.  MAJCOM Treaty Officer Roles and Responsibilities 4.1.6.1.  MAJCOM  Treaty  Officers  are  responsible  for  coordination  with  MAJCOM programs that may impact treaty obligations. 4.1.6.2.  Some  treaty  obligations,  like  modifications  to  mission  equipment  and  sensors, are accomplished by contractors.  Affected MAJCOM Treaty Officers are responsible for coordinating  requirements  and  monitoring  contractual  agreements  to  ensure  work  is completed according to treaty specifications. 4.1.6.3.  MAJCOM  Treaty  Officers  are  responsible  for  training  and  guidance  for installation personnel. 4.1.6.4.  MAJCOM Treaty Officers’ primary role, if present during an OST mission when the  installation  TCO  is  also  present,  is  to  observe  treaty  activities  to  improve  their understanding  of  how  bases  support  and  execute  their  plan  to  comply  with  treaty protocols. 4.1.6.4.1.  While MAJCOM Treaty Officers are in an observer role, they may help the base meet OST requirements by interfacing through the installation TCO. 4.1.6.4.2.  By  directing  all  MAJCOM  Treaty  Officer  inputs  to  the  installation  TCO, the treaty team is ensured of having one consistent base point of contact for working issues and requesting support. 4.1.6.4.3.  The installation TCO will be the mission interface with the DTRA Escort Team  Chief.  (T-1).    Installation  TCO  responsibilities  are  detailed  in  Paragraph  4.2. (T-2) 4.1.6.4.4.  MAJCOM  Treaty  Officers  shall  not  interfere  with  the  DTRA  Escort Team’s  role  in  the  treaty  compliance  process  nor  interact  with  the  foreign  team representatives  unless  they  are  specifically  filling  in  for  the  installation  TCO  or specifically requested to do so by the DTRA Escort Team Chief. 4.1.6.5.  MAJCOM Treaty  Officers, if present  at  a host airfield during an OST mission, shall not directly represent USG, DoD, or Air Force positions to either the DTRA Escort Team or to foreign team representatives during the execution of the OST mission.  This includes  during  crew  rest  and  cultural  activities, unless  the  MAJCOM  Treaty  Officer  is acting  in  the  capacity  of  the  installation  TCO  or  asked  to  do  so  by  the  DTRA  Escort Team Chief.  AFI16-604  31 MAY 2016 29 4.1.6.5.1.  MAJCOM Treaty Officers are responsible for understanding current  USG, DoD,  and  Air  Force  positions/guidance  relating  to  the  hosting  of  OST  activities  on U.S. territory and/or USAF bases. 4.1.6.5.2.  If  questions  arise,  the  MAJCOM  Treaty  Officer  should  coordinate  with their  chain  of  command  and/or  AF/A10S  for  clarification.    The  MAJCOM  Treaty Officer  advises  the  installation  TCO  with  responses  to  communicate  to  the  DTRA Escort Team. 4.1.6.6.  Ensure identification and prevention of any alleged prohibited activity, when the DTRA Escort Team and foreign team representatives are at a host airfield during an OST mission,  is  in  accordance  with  USG,  DoD,  and/or  Air  Force  guidance,  and  is  the responsibility  of  the  DTRA  Escort  Team,  supported  by  the  installation  TCO,  in  direct support of treaty compliance. 4.1.6.6.1.  The  MAJCOM  Treaty  Officer  has  the  responsibility  to  promptly  notify their  chain  of  command,  including  AF/A10S,  of  any  alleged  prohibited  activity reported  by  their  installation  TCOs  during  OST  activities  at  hosted  airfields,  the circumstances of those activities, and the resultant actions taken. 4.1.7.  Command and Control 4.1.7.1.  Effective  command  and  control  is  critical  for  treaty  implementation,  especially during observation activities. 4.1.7.2.  Timely and accurate treaty notifications are essential to facilitate proper facility preparations.    MAJCOM  Treaty  Officers  are  responsible  for  ensuring  MAJCOM Command  Post  Controllers  have  current  notification  formats  and  use  proper  reporting procedures to notify subordinate Wings/Units and tenant organizations of upcoming OST events.    These  notification  formats  and  reporting  procedures  can  be  obtained  from AF/A10S  (usaf.pentagon.af-a10.mbx.A10S-open-skies@mail.mil)  or  DSN  (312)  224-0676). 4.1.7.2.1.  Each  MAJCOM  and  subordinate  units  must  have  a  24-hour  point  of contact, typically the Command Post or Operations Center, for OST notifications. (T-2).    It  is  vital  all  organizations  that  may  be  impacted  receive  proper  and  timely notifications.  Notifications of intent to  conduct  observation activities over the U.S., or over nations hosting  U.S.  Air  Force personnel  and equipment, affect  all U.S.  Air Force Units on the territory of Open Skies participating states.  However, notification of the observation flight route may only affect those activities along the specific flight route. 4.1.8.  Liaison between Installation, MAJCOM, and AF/A10S 4.1.8.1.  Command Focal Point.  MAJCOM Treaty  Officers are the focal  point for OST matters as they affect the MAJCOM. 4.1.8.2.  Communications.    MAJCOM  Treaty  Officers  are  a  vital  communications  link between  subordinate  installations  and  AF/A10S  and  combatant  commands.    They  are  a key  player  in  sharing  information  across  the  Open  Skies  community.    In  particular, MAJCOM  Treaty  Officers  keep  AF/A10S  informed  of  any  activity  at  designated  Open  30 AFI16-604  31 MAY 2016 Skies airfields that could impact OST activities (e.g., runway closures, air shows, major exercises/operations that impact ramp space or billeting challenges, etc.). 4.1.9.  Training 4.1.9.1.  Arms  Control  Training  and  Awareness.    MAJCOM  Treaty  Officers  are responsible for ensuring subordinate installation TCOs and MAJCOM personnel receive appropriate  OST  training.    Training  can  be  accomplished  by  attending  the  AF  Arms Control  Overview  Course,  AF-level  OST  workshops,  MAJCOM-level  arms  control workshops, or by participating in JTFs and/or U.S.-only Blue-on-Blue training activities. 4.1.9.2.  Arms  Control  Courses.    DTRA  offers  annual  OST  courses  in  the  Washington, DC,  area.    MAJCOM  Treaty  Officers  and  installation  TCOs  are  highly  encouraged  to participate.  Course dates are announced in advance to all MAJCOMs. 4.1.9.3.  JTFs and Blue-on-Blue training flights.   Joint and U.S.-only training flights are valuable training activities for the aircrews, mission teams, and airfield logistics support personnel.    These  flights  also  exercise  the  notification  process  while  validating operational  procedures  and  airfield  OST  compliance  plans.    Finally,  they  validate logistics  support  capabilities,  security  procedures,  and  hosting  responsibilities,  and provide opportunities for TCOs and base facilities to operationally train in a near “real-world” environment.  TCOs should strive to make these exercises as realistic as possible by  taking  time,  manpower,  cost,  and  mission  team  requests/desires  into  consideration.  During these training activities artificial scenarios are introduced and after-hours support may  be  necessary.    Exercise  logistic  support,  to  include  fleet  service  for  the  expected aircraft type, regardless of type of aircraft used for simulation or the necessity of service requirements. 4.1.10.  Resource Management 4.1.10.1.  MAJCOM  Treaty  Officers  function  as  resource  managers  monitoring  arms control  (including  OST)  funding  and  manpower.    Successful  execution  requires  close coordination  between  MAJCOM  Treaty  Officers,  installation  TCOs,  and  appropriate financial  management  (FM)  counterparts.  Budgeting  and  manpower  requirements  differ from  base  to  base  and  MAJCOM  to  MAJCOM.  Effective  resource  management  is necessary to ensure sufficient funding and proper program execution. 4.1.10.2.  Budget. MAJCOM Treaty Officers typically act as command Program Element Managers  (PEM)  for  PE  35145F.    If  they  are  not  the  PEM,  they  work  closely  with  the individual filling that role. 4.1.10.2.1.  PEMs  are  responsible  for  managing  resources  and  budgeting  funds  for MAJCOM  arms  control  activities  and  ensuring  MAJCOM  installation  requirements are included in  budget  submissions. The MAJCOM treaty office and FM work with the field installations to build an Execution Plan. 4.1.10.2.2.  AF/A10S  validates  the  MAJCOM  Execution  Plan  by  rationalizing  the OST requirements within the Air Force arms control budget. 4.1.10.2.3.  The  installation  Treaty  Officers  provide  their  requirements  to  the MAJCOM Treaty Officers, which consolidate these requirements and submit them to  AFI16-604  31 MAY 2016 31 AF/A10S.  MAJCOM Treaty Officers should ensure that all subordinate installation requirements are identified and defended, when necessary. 4.1.10.2.3.1.  MAJCOM Treaty Officers will ensure that all requirements comply with  fiscal  requirements  in  the  DoD  FMR  Vol.  5,  AFI  65-601Volume  I,  Budget Guidance and Procedures, and AFI 65-603, Official Representation Funds. 4.1.10.2.4.  MAJCOM and subordinate installation TCOs must work closely together to ensure funding requests and distributions are received in a timely manner. 4.1.10.3.  Manpower.    MAJCOM  Treaty  Officers  are  responsible  for  monitoring manpower  authorizations  and  identifying  and  defending  manpower  requirements.  Most Wings,  some  MAJCOMs,  and  other  arms  control  billet  authorizations  are  centrally managed  by  AF/A10S.    These  billets  are  not  under  the  control  of  MAJCOM  planners.  Moving  or  reclassifying  a  billet  requires  coordination  and  concurrence  from  AF/A10S.  In  accordance  with  AFPD  16-6  and  AFI  16-601,  MAJCOM  planners  must  ensure  they have the appropriate billet authorizations assigned to support MAJCOM headquarters and subordinate Wing/Unit arms control requirements. 4.2.  Installation Treaty Compliance Officer (TCO) Responsibilities 4.2.1.  Duties, Roles, and Responsibilities 4.2.1.1.  Compliance  Plans.    Each  installation  designated  as  an  Open  Skies  airfield  will have  an  OST  compliance  plan  applicable  to  that  airfield.  (T-1)    Those  airfields  not designated to host OST operations must have provisions to ensure appropriate support for OST  aircraft  that  may  divert  to  their  airfield  (for  weather,  emergency,  or  other  special circumstance). (T-2) 4.2.1.1.1.  Because  of  the  requirement  in  AFI  16-603  for  installation  TCOs  to maintain  installation  Implementation  and  Compliance  Plans  for  applicable  treaties, even  those  airfields  not  designated  to  directly  support  OST  observation  activities  or those  that  are  potentially  alternate  airfields  must  have  a  plan  ready  to  execute  if  it becomes necessary. (T-3) 4.2.1.1.2.  Note: This requirement to develop an installation OST Compliance Plan is only applicable to those installations designated to support OST activities.  A listing of  installations  designated  to  support  OST  activities  is  available  by  contacting AF/A10S. 4.2.1.1.3.  The  installation  OST  compliance  plan  will  detail  the  logistics  support  to facilitate OST activities to ensure all OST timelines are met. (T-3).  Installation TCOs will  coordinate  compliance  plans  with  their  parent  MAJCOM.  (T-2).    Installations will provide completed plans to AF/A10S through normal distribution. (T-2) 4.2.1.1.4.  The  installation  OST  compliance  plan  will  include,  but  is  not  limited  to base support procedures, escort requirements, notifications and reports, procedures to notify  local  personnel  and  affected  organizations,  security  provisions,  photography policy,  weather  support  provisions,  billeting  and  transportation  requirements, protocol, and public affairs procedures. (T-3) 4.2.1.1.5.  Base activity checklists are important components of the compliance plan.  The  OST  compliance  plan  identifies  offices/organizations  responsible  for  providing  32 AFI16-604  31 MAY 2016 logistics support to the visiting observation aircraft and mission teams.  Installations must ensure the final plan includes a list showing all organizations tasked by the plan including other tenant organizations. (T-3) 4.2.1.1.6.  Suggested components of a Compliance Plan: 4.2.1.1.6.1.  Services. This includes lodging, dining, and mortuary services.  Plan lodging and dining arrangements in advance.  Consult with the DTRA Open Skies Division for lodging preferences and requirements. 4.2.1.1.6.2.  Security.    This  section  includes  high  and  low  threat  security procedures  for  escorts,  guards,  inspector  entry  into  controlled  areas,  operations security   NOTE: Installations must ensure foreign inspectors do not see all of our normal security procedures.  (T-2)    Make  every  effort  to  safeguard  our  security  procedures  from foreign inspectors to the maximum extent practical. (OPSEC),  and  communications  security (COMSEC). 4.2.1.1.6.2.1.  High threat options would be imposed if a known threat to  the inspection  is  recognized.    It  could  include  measures  such  as  posting  guards and  implementing  entry  control  points  requiring  Entry  Access  Lists  (EAL) granting  the  mission  teams  and  local  escorts  authorized  access  to  inspection sites and support facilities. 4.2.1.1.6.2.2.  Low  threat  options  may  require  implementation  of  normal distinguished visitor procedures. 4.2.1.1.6.2.3.  Include  OPSEC  procedures  such  as  limiting  photography  and access, and controlling travel routes.  Installations must protect the flight line and  other  areas  of  sensitive  operations.    (Reference  Air  Force  policy  on  the use of personal cameras in paragraph 7.12.) (T-2) 4.2.1.1.6.2.4.  Installations  must  include  COMSEC  concerns  (e.g.,  how inspectors  are  allowed  to  communicate  with  their  Embassy/consulate)in preparations.    Example:  If  using  government  phone  lines,  have  local  escorts establish the link prior to foreign inspectors’ use. (T-2) 4.2.1.1.6.2.5.  U.S. escorts must be vigilant in observing foreign team member use of personal communications devices (e.g., cell phones, smart phones, etc.) when  they  are  on  federal  property  and  report  unusual  observations  to  the DTRA Team Chief. (T-2) 4.2.1.1.6.3.  Medical.    Include  arrangements  for  emergency/non-elective  medical treatment  of  mission  team  members.    DTRA  is  responsible  for  the  cost  of  all medical treatments and should be billed accordingly. (T-2) 4.2.1.1.6.4.  Communications.    Installations  must  ensure  this  section  includes public  address  systems  for  ceremonies/briefings,  contact  between  local  escorts, methods for inspectors to contact their embassies or sponsoring activities, or other treaty-specific items. (T-3) 4.2.1.1.6.5.  Transportation.    All  personnel  transportation  requirements,  arrival locations),  and through  departure  (covering  both  primary  and  alternate equipment/baggage  handling include  special  handling instructions  for to  AFI16-604  31 MAY 2016 33 inspection  equipment  are  included  in  this  section.    The  TCO  should  attempt  to accommodate the DTRA Team Chief’s requests for support of transportation for off-base and cultural activities for the foreign teams as much as practical, within existing guidelines/restrictions.  In cases requiring Wing Commander approval for the  type  of  activity  or  location,  the  TCO  should  facilitate  that  request.  Installations  must  ensure  procedures  for  facilitating  movement  of  the  foreign observation  team  through  the  security  checkpoint/gate  and  onto  the  base  are covered in the Compliance Plan. (T-2) 4.2.1.1.6.6.  Funding.    Considerations  include  specific  billing  and  payment procedures.  Ensure the DTRA Team Chief, or his/her designated liaison, knows what  is  necessary  in  advance.    Coordinate  with  base  activities  for  items  DTRA requests  to  accomplish  their  responsibilities.    Coordinate  with  your  MAJCOM Treaty  Officer  and  PEM,  preferably  in  advance  of  incurring  expenses,  for reimbursement  of  expenses  not  paid  by  DTRA,  or  that  DTRA  cannot  pay.    If DTRA  is  not  able  to  fund  a  TCO  request,  O&M  dollars  can  be  pursued  at  the discretion  of  the  local  installation  Commander  as  long  as  the  requirement  is authorized IAW financial regulations. 4.2.1.1.6.7.  Public Affairs.  Clearly-established ground rules on control of media movement  and  actions  are  necessary  to  prevent  interference  with  inspections.  Wing  Public  Affairs  offices  will  comply  with  USG  and  DoD  posture  for  OST flights.  (T-0).  The  USG  and  DOD  posture  is  “response  to  query  (RTQ).”    This means  Open  Skies  Treaty  personnel  can  respond  to  inquiries  but  not  actively promote  activities.    There  are  no  restrictions  placed  on  articles  for  the  base newspaper or website that reflect that an OST mission or activity is taking place or was recently completed. (T-3) 4.2.1.1.6.8.  Personnel.    Personnel  include  base  escorts,  facility  managers, baggage  details,  technical  equipment  inspection  teams,  and  inspection  support staff.    Support  staffs  are  individuals  working  real-time  contingencies  while  the treaty  office  is  busy  with  inspectors.    Support  staff  must  have  a  representative from each key support and inspection organization. (T-3) 4.2.1.1.6.9.  Training.  Commanders are responsible for creating and maintaining a  training  program  in  concert  with  utilizing  the  installation  TCO's  expertise  to prepare all base players in an OST activity to perform their duties.  Not everyone is suited to perform escort duties—maturity is a key ingredient in selecting local escorts.    While  no  specific  certification  is  required,  Commanders  should  ensure mature  individuals  are  selected.    Commanders  may  use  exceptional  junior personnel  (E-4  and  below)  only  under  exceptional  circumstances.    Commander support  in  maintaining  the  required  number  of  trained  escorts  is  very  important.  In  most  cases,  periodic  refresher  training  is  desirable  and  necessary.    At  other times, just-in-time training of local personnel may be all a base can complete due to limited availability of personnel.  Installations must have a goal of maintaining a pool of trained personnel, as continuity promotes a high level of efficiency and support for complying with treaty protocols. (T-3) 4.2.1.1.6.10.  Safety/Security  Briefing.    Upon  arrival  at  a  host  airfield  the  TCO  34 AFI16-604  31 MAY 2016 must present a safety/security briefing to the visiting mission teams. (T-2).  These briefings  are  adapted  to  the  local  environment  and  provide  a  perspective  of  the base and facilities to be used by the mission teams.  The briefing also covers the weather  conditions  the  teams  should  expect,  installation  security  policies,  escort procedures  and  photography  policy,  and  whom  to  contact  if  any  visitor  needs assistance.    Develop  these  briefings  in  advance  and  coordinate  with  the  DTRA Open  Skies  Division  for   NOTE:  Whatever safety/security rules the TCO levies on the foreign mission teams should also be followed  by  the  U.S.  mission  teams  and  the  local  base  escorts.    Foreign  Teams may not always abide by our flight line safety rules and procedures, so vigilance by the U.S. and installation escorts is mandatory.  However, we must continue to inform them of our rules and available safety equipment. (T-2) into  Russian. translation 4.2.1.1.6.11.  Report  any  alleged  prohibited  activity,  when  the  DTRA  Escort Team and foreign team representatives are at a host airfield, to the DTRA Escort Team  Chief  immediately.    The  installation  TCO  shall  provide  support  to  the DTRA  Escort  Team  Chief  as  requested  to  facilitate  resolution  of  any  prohibited activity. (T-0) 4.2.1.1.6.12.  Protocol.  Protocol  activity  includes  arrangements  for  distinguished visitors  (DV),  arranging  off-base  meals,  reception  and  departure  functions, closing  ceremonies,  and  memento  exchanges.    Per  the  Treaty,    foreign  OST mission  team  members  are  afforded  diplomatic  rights  and  privileges  under  the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. 4.2.1.1.6.13.  Cultural  Activities.    At  the  DTRA  Team  Chief’s  request,  pre-coordinate and facilitate leisure activities such as tours, shopping, and recreational opportunities.    Work  with  affected  services:  Transportation,  Base  Exchange, Commissary,  Recreational  Services,  and  affected  civilian  establishments  as necessary. 4.2.1.2.  Reports.  The TCO will submit reports consistent with the guidance in Chapter 6. (T-3) 4.2.1.3.  Open  Skies  TCO  positions  are  a  scarce  manning  resource.    Frequently,  TCOs have a minimally-trained backup, if they have a  backup.  As such, installations with  an Arms  Control  PE35145F-funded  Open  Skies  TCO,  will  not  assign  duties  not  directly related to treaty activities if they interfere with TCO duties. (T-2) 4.2.2.  Installation  Expert.    As  the  installation  expert  on  the  OST,  TCOs  should  perform dynamic,  comprehensive analysis of the impact  of Open Skies activities on the installation, tenant  Units,  separately  located  facilities,  and  associated  missions.    This  requires  all  TCOs have  a  general  knowledge  of  the  OST.    In  this  role,  TCOs  answer  questions  regarding  the OST  as  well  as  identify  and  explain  the  effect  this  Treaty  may  have  on  the  installation’s military and commercial activities. 4.2.2.1.  Although  the  inspection  process  is  associated  with  the  observation  aircraft  and flight  operations,    TCOs  are  responsible  for  logistics  support  to  aircraft  operations  and mission teams.  AFI16-604  31 MAY 2016 35 4.2.2.2.  TCOs  host  observation  aircraft  for  Open  Skies  missions  and  training  flights.  This  involves  coordination  from  a  variety  of  supporting  activities  such  as:    Base  Ops,  weather  support,  transportation,  dining  and  billeting,  force  protection,  security  and OPSEC,  aircraft services (fuel,  water, air, de-icing, lavatory, flight  meals,  and parking),  protocol and public affairs, medical and recreational services, meeting/conference rooms and communications availability, and escorting. 4.2.2.3.  For  bases  that  host  aircraft  inspection  procedures,  pay  particular  attention  to facilitating flight line activities, including photography and access requirements. 4.2.2.4.  TCOs  should  work  closely  with  their  base  counterparts  to  identify  possible problems and recommend solutions. 4.2.2.5.  Open  Skies  missions  are  conducted  against  a  strict  timeline  directed  by  the Treaty.  There is flexibility in the timelines, but TCO inability to facilitate ground support actions that cause the mission to deviate from those timelines can result in violations of the  Treaty  and  create  a  diplomatic  challenge.    OST  timelines  are  identified  in  OST, Article VI. 4.2.2.6.  Routine  airfield  maintenance,  such  as  runway/taxiway  construction  and renovation  or  modifications  to  the  navigation  aids  associated  with  landing/take-off procedures can pose a potential implementation challenge.  For instance, if a runway is to be closed for a period of time to undergo resurfacing, etc., notify AF/A10S so the USG can  notify  all  other  Open  Skies  States  Parties  of  the  non-availability  of  that  airfield.  TCOs will maintain a working relationship with installation organizations to ensure they are well aware of base projects that may impact Open Skies activities. (T-2) 4.2.2.7.  Afford  major  installation/community  events,  that  could  impact  Open  Skies operations,  the  same  attention.    Air  shows,  marathons,  exercises,  inspections,  weather events  (e.g.,  hurricane  staging  support),  etc.,  may  limit  ramp  space,  transportation,  or billeting availability and can affect the ability to host Open Skies activities.  Installation TCOs  will  notify  AF/A10S  as  soon  as  possible  once identify  major installation/community events that could impact Open Skies operations. (T-3) they 4.2.3.  Education,  Training,  and  Exercises.    Education,  training,  and  exercise  activities  are not  expected  to  be  an  in-depth  study  on  OST.    They  should  focus  on  the  timeline  for  the event,  installation  and  escort  responsibilities,  OPSEC,  and  impacts/vulnerabilities  of observation flights. 4.2.3.1.  Installation  TCOs  develop  and  maintain training  programs.  Information  can  be  obtained  from  other  bases,  MAJCOMs,  Air  Force  Office  of  Special Investigations  (AFOSI),  DTRA,  and  AF/A10S.    TCOs  will  participate  in  and  conduct training appropriate to their responsibility. (T-3) installation 4.2.4.  Logistics Support 4.2.4.1.  Aircraft  Support.    TCOs  at  airfields  supporting  Open  Skies  activities  will facilitate  aircraft  servicing  and  maintenance  as  needed  and/or  as  requested  by  the  55th Wing  or  the  DTRA  Escort  Team  Chief.  (T-0).    This  includes,  but  is  not  limited  to: refueling, gaseous oxygen, nitrogen, de-icing, ground equipment, power carts, air stairs, water, latrine servicing, weather support, and flight meals.  36 AFI16-604  31 MAY 2016 4.2.4.1.1.  Standard Air Force safety procedures apply for aircraft servicing activities. 4.2.4.1.2.  Installations will submit bills for fuel and other aircraft services for foreign observation aircraft to the DTRA Escort Team Chief or financial agent. (T-3) 4.2.4.1.3.  U.S. personnel will not enter foreign-owned, operated, or registered aircraft without permission from the DTRA Escort Team Chief following consultation with a member of the foreign observation team. (T-0) 4.2.4.1.4.  U.S.  personnel  will not  conduct  maintenance on foreign-owned, operated, or registered aircraft without the express permission of the DTRA Escort Team Chief and the Aircraft Commander. (T-0) 4.2.4.2.  In  the  event  the  designated  OST  airfield  is  unusable  for  any  period  of  time, notify AF/A10S (through the MAJCOM) of that fact, and coordinate logistics support at the  nearest  commercial  airport  capable  of  supporting  OST  operations.    In  addition, installations will coordinate with DTRA, as appropriate, to facilitate OST operations at an alternate airport in the vicinity. (T-0) 4.2.4.2.1.  If  the  alternate  airport  is  reasonably  close  to,  and  accessible  from,  the designated  OST  airfield,  the  TCO  should  make  every  effort  to  support  the  OST activity with organic support and services.  If the alternate airfield is outside that area or the installation is unable to support OST activities at the alternate airfield, the TCO will attempt to assist the DTRA Escort Team in facilitating airfield logistics support. (T-2)  AFI16-604  31 MAY 2016 37 Chapter 5 MISSION TASKING, PLANNING, AND EXECUTION 5.1.  Mission Tasking 5.1.1.  Active and passive mission quotas are determined and deconflicted in accordance with the OST.  AOMs  are determined by the governing NSPD and the USG  Interagency; tasked by OSD(Policy) and SECDEF/CJCS EXORDS, and IMPORDS; and flown to fulfill national collection  objectives  generated  by  USG  entities.    The  NGA  is  responsible  for  collection objectives.  JTFs with partner country participants are approved by both the USG Interagency Backstopping  Group by OUSD(AT&L)/A/SSI/SS&TC.  OCONUS JTF’s are included in SECDEF/CJCS IMPORDS.  U.S.-only training flights in the CONUS are coordinated between DTRA and the Air Force and are approved by the OSIWG. the  DoD  OSIWG. tasked and  JTFs are 5.1.1.1.  The schedule approved by the USG Interagency and OSIWG constitutes tasking to support the Open Skies schedule.  The schedule forwarded from AF/A10S to the Air Force  MAJCOMs  and  other  affected  agencies/offices  constitutes  tasking  to  Air  Force components  to  support  the  USG  Open  Skies  schedule.    In  addition,  any  OCONUS activities are tasked by SECDEF/CJCS IMPORDS. 5.1.1.2.  AOM  scheduling  is  determined  by  time  of  year  and  areas  of  interest,  is deconflicted  with  allies  who  also  want  observation  quotas  over  the  same  State  Party,  is approved by the USG Interagency Backstopping Group, is tasked by OSD(Policy), and is further tasked by SECDEF/CJCS IMPORDS. 5.1.1.2.1.  SECDEF, through CJCS, tasks the Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) to deploy  the  U.S.  Open  Skies  aircraft  to  the  EUCOM  AOR  to  conduct  Treaty-quota AOMs and OCONUS JTFs via quarterly IMPORDS.  TRANSCOM and PACOM are tasked to support the deployments, as necessary. 5.1.1.2.2.  Commander,  ACC  deploys  the  U.S.  Open  Skies  aircraft  via  follow-on DEPORD.  Note:  Per AFI 10-401, Commander, ACC, is authorized to deploy assets to meet OST requirements. 5.1.1.2.3.  ACC tasks the 55th Wing (55WG) to support the Open Skies deployment with  dedicated  organic  assets,  including  an  OC-135B  Open  Skies  aircraft,  air  and maintenance crews, and Aeronautical Systems Engineers (ASE)/ Sensor Maintenance Technicians (SMTs). 5.1.1.2.4.  The 55th Wing tasks the 55th Operations Group, who in turn tasks the 45th Reconnaissance Squadron (45RS) to deploy assets to support the Open Skies tasking. 5.1.1.3.  JTFs  are  approved  by  the  USG  Interagency  Backstopping  Group  and deconflicted by the OSIWG. 5.1.1.3.1.  OUSD(AT&L)/A/SSI/SS&TC,  Chair  of  the  OSIWG,  then  distributes  the JTF schedule to OSIWG members for approval. 5.1.1.3.1.1.  For  OCONUS  JTFs  in  the  U.S.  Open  Skies  aircraft,  the  aircraft deployment  is  tasked  via  IMPORD/DEPORD  following  procedures  similar  to  38 AFI16-604  31 MAY 2016 taskings for AOMs. 5.1.1.3.1.2.  For  CONUS  JTFs  in  the  U.S.  Open  Skies  aircraft,  the  events  are reflected  on  the  schedule  distributed  by  the  OSIWG  and  forwarded  to  ACC  by AF/A10S. 5.1.1.4.  U.S.-only training activities (e.g., Blue-on-Blue flights) are coordinated with and approved by the OSIWG, and reflected in the schedule distributed by the OSIWG.  This schedule is forwarded by AF/A10S to affected Air Force MAJCOMs and other affected agencies/offices. 5.1.1.5.  AF/A10S  represents  Air  Force  equities  and  interests  at  the  OSIWG.    The OSMPF and MAJCOMs make inputs into the OSIWG process thru AF/A10S.  ACC will make  AF/A10S  aware  of  any/all  issues  associated  with  aircraft  and  crew  availability  in order to avoid tasking those assets when not available.  If ACC cannot support a tasked activity, they must provide rationale to AF/A10S as soon as practical, with an estimate of next availability. 5.2.  Mission Planning 5.2.1.  A Mission Planning Cell (MPC) consisting of representatives from NGA, DTRA/J3-OSO, and 45RS will develop  mission plans for all tasked missions a minimum  of three (3) weeks prior to any tasked mission. (T-0).   The MPC will submit completed mission plans to the  OSIWG  no  later  than  14  days  prior  to  the  planned  aircraft  movement  for  a  tasked mission. (T-1). 5.2.1.1.  For active missions, general responsibilities are as follows: 5.2.1.1.1.  NGA  chairs  the  MPC,  provides  collection  objectives,  and  certifies  the mission plan meets collection objectives. 5.2.1.1.2.  DTRA  provides  Treaty  expertise  and  certifies  the  mission  plan  meets Treaty guidelines. 5.2.1.1.3.  45RS  representatives  provide  aviation  expertise  and  certify  the  mission plan  is  flyable  and  OC-135B  safety  of  flight  and  operating  parameters  are  met.    If required,  the  45RS  should  request  operating  waivers,  with  justification,  from  the appropriate authority.  When aircraft is operating in the EUCOM AOR, the 45RS or the  95RS  will  request  and  obtain  OG/CC  operating  waiver  approval  when  required, through 100 OG/CC. (T-3). 5.2.2.  Conduct mission planning for overseas Open Skies missions at DTRA headquarters at Fort Belvoir, VA. 5.2.2.1.  For  CONUS  JTF  missions,  planning  may  be  scheduled  at  the  beginning  of  the JTF mission. 5.2.3.  Mission  planners  will  build  all  mission  planning  and  execution  based  on  a  16-hour crew day. (T-2) 5.2.3.1.  The  flight  crew  may  be  augmented,  but  they  will  augment  only  for  duty  not involving flying (DNIF) coverage and cannot extend the crew duty day. (T-3).  AFI16-604  31 MAY 2016 39 5.2.4.  Mission planners must plan to provide 12 hours of crew rest between the last official duty  of  the  previous  duty  period  and  the  first  official  duty  of  the  subsequent  flight  duty period. (T-2) 5.2.5.  DTRA/J3-OSO  should  distribute  a  Deployment  Memorandum  (DM)  as  soon  as possible  following  each  MPC,  identifying  parameters  of  the  event,  timeline/itinerary,  and names of individuals involved.  45RS and the OSMPF must provide names of their personnel involved in the activity to DTRA at the MPC or as soon as practical.

(T-0) 5.5.  Aircrew Management 5.5.1.  Flight Duty Period (FDP) 5.5.1.1.  The FDP is defined by AFI 11-202 Volume 3 (Including ACC Supplements) and AFI 11-2RC-135 Volume 3. 5.5.1.2.  Due to the unique nature and political sensitivity of Open Skies Treaty missions, the  aircrews  will  begin  the  flight  duty  period  for  Active  Missions  at  the  transportation show time commencing that day’s FDP. (T-2) 5.5.2.  Crew Rest 5.5.2.1.  Crew  rest  is  defined  by  AFI  11-202  Volume  3  (Including  ACC  Supplements), Flying  Operations:  General  Flight  Rules,  and  AFI  11-2RC-135  Volume  3,  Flying Operations: RC/OC/WC/TC-135 Operations Procedures. 5.5.2.2.  Due to the unique nature and political sensitivity of Open Skies Treaty missions, OC-135B aircrews will not begin crew rest until the completion of the last official duty event, to include transportation from the event to aircrew lodging. (T-2) 5.6.  Aircrew Training and Qualifications 5.6.1.  The  U.S.  Open  Skies  mission  involves  operating  specially-equipped  U.S.  Air  Force OC-135B  aircraft  on  observation  flights  over  foreign  countries,  primarily  the  Russian Federation,  Belarus,  and  Ukraine.    Observation  missions  may  entail  low-altitude  flights  in austere infrastructure  support  and  diplomatically-sensitive environments  with  a degree of mission uncertainty.  Aircrews and maintenance crews must be appropriately trained and certified for these challenging and highly visible missions. (T-1) locations  with limited  AFI16-604  31 MAY 2016 41 5.6.2.  Do not certify Aircraft Commanders as mission qualified for Open Skies deployments until they have participated in at least two Open Skies missions.  An Aircraft Commander on a  second  Open  Skies  mission  may  be  the  pilot-in-command  if  accompanied  by  a  qualified Open Skies Aircraft Commander. (T-2) 5.6.3.  Basic  OC-135B  aircrew  training,  evaluation  criteria,  and  operations  procedures  are listed  in  AFIs  11-2RC-135,  Volumes  1  Flying  Operations:  RC/OC/WC/TC-135  Aircrew Training;  Volume  2,  Flying  Operations:  RC/OC/WC/TC-135  Aircrew  Evaluation  Training; and Volume 3, Flying Operations: RC/OC/WC/TC-135 Aircrew Evaluation Criteria. 5.7.  Aircraft and Sensor Maintenance 5.7.1.  Maintenance crews must ensure the OC-135B is capable of operating independently of unique support equipment for periods of approximately two weeks. (T-2) 5.7.1.1.  Logistics  support  during  an  Open  Skies  mission  should  primarily  consist  of organizational-level  maintenance  provided  by  dedicated  crew  chief(s)  and  additional aircraft and sensor maintenance personnel aboard the aircraft. 5.7.1.2.  Installations  must  coordinate  maintenance  planning  and  scheduling  for organizational,  intermediate,  and  depot-level  maintenance  of  on-equipment  and  off-equipment sustainment activities, through HQ ACC functional managers for HQ AFMC management. (T-2) 5.7.1.3.  The  55WG  will  determine  specific  maintenance  crew  requirements  for deployment. (T-3) 5.7.2.  Mission Suite Maintenance 5.7.2.1.  Prior  to  deployment  for  an  AOM,  the  Sensor  Maintenance  Technicians  (SMT) should verify the proper configuration and operation of the mission equipment including the  sensors’  data  annotation  and  recording  system,  the  sensor  control  stations,  and  the main  and  spare  mission  equipment  feeds.    Per  requirement,  SMTs  confirm  the  sensor covers are firmly attached prior to take-off. (T-2) 5.7.2.2.  If any item of equipment had been replaced, modified, or upgraded prior to use on an AOM, it may require operational testing to ensure it is functioning as designed and advertised to partner countries. 5.7.2.2.1.  Aircrews will test any sensor that requires confirmation that modifications, maintenance, or upgrades did not affect the certified altitude above ground to which the  sensor  can  achieve  no  better  than  Treaty  allowed  resolution  (Hmin)  over  an approved target at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH. (T-1) that  requires  confirmation item  of  mission  equipment 5.7.2.2.2.  Any that maintenance  did  not  affect  the  operation  of  that  equipment,  by  collection  of  sample imagery,  must  be  tested  in  accordance  with  AFI  14-104,  Oversight  of  Intelligence Activities,  to  ensure  compliance  with  domestic  imagery  collection  regulations.  (T-1)  NASIC OSMPF and ACC/A2XX will coordinate as necessary to obtain the required Proper Use Memorandum (PUM) IAW AFI 14-104 and DOD 5240.1-R, Activities of DOD Intelligence Components That Affect United States Persons.

Notifications include:  intent to conduct an  observation;  arrivals  at  and  departures from  POEs/POXs,  OSAs,  and  OSRAs; proposed/approved  mission  plans;  delay/termination  of  observation  flights;  and  other miscellaneous reports. 6.1.1.  Notifications  associated  with  Passive  Observation  Missions  are  identified  in  the OSIWG  SOP  05-01:  Open  Skies  Passive  Notification  Procedures  and  in  SOP  05-03:  Open Skies  Training  Coordination  Process  and  Notification  Procedures  for  Training  Flights  over the  United  States.  Contact  the  AF/A10S  POC  (usaf.pentagon.af-a10.mbx.A10S-open-skies@mail.mil) for copies. 6.2.  Types  of  Notifications.  The  following  paragraphs  address  the  notification  processes  in CONUS, Alaska, and Hawaii.  Note:  The notification process in Europe is very different and is detailed in the HQ USAFE Open Skies Compliance Plan. 6.2.1.  Voice  Format (VF)  Notifications.   Open  Skies VF notifications are transmitted from the DTRA Operations Center to the Headquarters Air Force Operations Center.  From the AF Operations Center they are automatically distributed to the Air Force MAJCOM Operations Centers/Command  Posts  and  additional  offices,  including  AF/A10S.    MAJCOMs  then  re-distribute these VF notifications to their Units, tenant organizations, and TCOs. 6.2.1.1.  The following is a list of current OST VF Notifications: Figure 6.1.  Current OST VF Notifications. VF#1: Notification of Intent to conduct an Observation Flight over the U.S. (Inside the U.S.)  VF#2: Notification of Intent to Conduct an Observation Flight (Outside the U.S.)  VF#5: Observing Party’s Initial Arrival at the POE  VF#6: Departure of Observation Teams from the POE for the OSA  VF#7: Arrival of Observation Teams at OSA  VF#8: Completion of Pre-flight Inspection  VF#9: Completion of Demonstration Flight  VF#10: Submission of Proposed Mission Plan  VF#11: Agreement to Approved Mission Plan   AFI16-604  31 MAY 2016 43 VF#12: Observation Aircraft Take-off  VF#13: Observation Aircraft Landing  VF#15: Observation Team Departure from the OSA for the POX  VF#16: Observation Team Arrival at POX from the OSA  VF#17: Observation Party’s Final Departure from the POX  VF#19: Miscellaneous Report  6.2.2.  Telephone Notification System (TNS). 6.2.2.1.  DTRA is tasked with making early notification of Open Skies missions over the U.S  to  USG  Departments/Agencies,  the  FAA,  and  related  industry  sites/facilities throughout  the U.S.   To  accomplish  this, DTRA  developed two computer systems:   the Passive  Overflight  Module  (POM)  and  the  TNS.    Both  systems  are  a  part  of  the  Open Skies  Management  and  Planning  System  (OSMAPS)  which  provides  DTRA  with computerized mission analysis, planning, flight following, and assessment capabilities. 6.2.2.1.1.  The POM performs analysis of Open Skies overflight by foreign observers.  It  generates  notification  messages  to  sites  requesting  overflight  information.  Messages are sent using the TNS. 6.2.2.1.2.  The  POM/TNS  is  an  automated  notification  system,  utilizing  both telephone and facsimile networks, providing timely OST information to a designated list of sites.  All USAF components should take advantage of the POM/TNS. 6.2.2.1.2.1.  There  are  two  distribution  lists  associated  with  the  POM:    Standard Call List and Affected Call List. 6.2.2.1.2.1.1.  The  Standard  Call  List  includes  telephone  and  fax  numbers  of Service and MAJCOM Headquarters and others as requested. 6.2.2.1.2.1.2.  The  Affected  Call  List  includes  telephone  and/or  fax  numbers of  those  locations  in  the  direct  path  of  an  expected  observation  overflight  in addition to those on the Standard Call List. 6.2.2.1.2.2.  Units not receiving POM/TNS notifications that wish to be added to the  distribution lists,  or  desire  a  change,  should  contact  AF/A10S (usaf.pentagon.af-a10.mbx.A10S-open-skies@mail.mil  or  DSN  (312)  224-0676). 6.2.3.  Electronic Notifications.   These are e-mail notifications from DTRA.  Units that wish to should  contact  AF/A10S (usaf.pentagon.af-a10.mbx.A10S-open-skies@mail.mil or DSN (312) 224-0676). these  notifications  directly receive from  DTRA 6.2.3.1.  AF/A10S  retransmits  these  electronic  notifications  to  a  wide  distribution  list.  This  distribution  is  a  back-up  to  the  official  notification  process.    Units  that  wish  to  be  44 AFI16-604  31 MAY 2016 to added a10.mbx.A10S-open-skies@mail.mil) or DSN (312) 224-0676. should  contact  AF/A10S this  distribution list (usaf.pentagon.af-6.3.  High  Value  Activity  (HVA)  Reporting.  The  following  paragraphs  address  the  HVA reporting  processes  in  CONUS,  Alaska,  and  Hawaii.    Note:    Commands  in  Europe  have  little opportunity to  impact  overflight  of host nations but  can affect  U.S.  activities that could  impact the overflight  or be impacted by the overflight.   The process  for reporting significant  events  in Europe  and  for  protecting  U.S.  activities  from  any  adverse  impact  of  the  OST  overflight  is detailed in the HQ USAFE Open Skies Compliance Plan. 6.3.1.  Upon  Receipt  of  a  Notification  of  Intent  to  Conduct  an  Observation  Flight  over  the U.S.  (VF#1),  MAJCOMs  will  initiate  the  collection  of  HVAs  from  their  subordinate/tenant Units/facilities  to  determine  any  activities  within  their  purview  that  could  impact  or  be impacted  by  an  observation  overflight.    MAJCOMs  will  report  their  HVAs,  or  a  Negative Report, (703)  614-0676, usaf.pentagon.af-a10.mbx.A10S-open-skies@mail.mil as soon as possible after receipt of a VF#1, but no later than 48 hours after its receipt.  AF/A10S must deliver these HVA Reports to the DOD HVA Group (HVAG) no later than 24 hours prior to arrival of the observation aircraft at the designated POE. (312)  224-0676,  Commercial to  AF/A10S  at  DSN 6.3.1.1.  The HVAG (reference Paragraph 3.1.5.) receives submissions  of HVA Reports from  the  Services  and  DoD  Agencies  and  provides  guidance  to  the  DTRA  U.S.  Escort Team  with  respect  to  mission  plan  negotiations.    If  an  Observing  Party’s  proposed mission plan is impacted by an identified HVA, or if an HVA impacts the flight, the U.S. Escort  Team  may  receive  guidance  to  attempt  to  negotiate  with  the  Observing  Party  to adjust the flight route to avoid the HVA. 6.3.1.2.  HVA  procedures  are  detailed  in  OSIWG  SOP  05-02:  High  Value  Activities (HVA)  Notification  Procedures.    Contact  AF/A10S  (usaf.pentagon.af-a10.mbx.A10S-open-skies@mail.mil) for the SOP and the HVA report format template. 6.3.2.  In general, an HVA is an activity that: 6.3.2.1.  May incur substantial monetary cost if postponed or cancelled, 6.3.2.2.  Cannot be concealed and reveals national security information if observed, 6.3.2.3.  Takes  advantage  of  a  unique  set  of  chronological  or  meteorological circumstances which cannot be duplicated, or 6.3.2.4.  The command/agency believes special circumstances apply. 6.3.3.  The  criteria  for  an  HVA  are  dynamic  and  subject  to  change  and  interpretation.  Typical  examples  of  HVAs  that  might  be  reported  by  the  Air  Force  include  space/missile launches.    Other  examples  of  HVAs  that  may  be  reported  are  weapons  movements, operations or major exercises, and equipment testing. 6.3.3.1.  It is the responsibility of the reporting installation to report those events they feel may  meet  the  requirements  of  an  HVA.    It  is  also  their  responsibility  to  protect  their HVA  from  observation,  as  they  would  from  satellite  vulnerability.    Various  protective measures are available, such as:  cancelling or postponing the HVA, shrouding or moving the  sensitive  equipment  indoors  during  the  period  of  vulnerability,  or  relocating  the sensitive equipment to another location that may not be vulnerable to observation.  Note:   AFI16-604  31 MAY 2016 45 When  an  observation  aircraft  is  eventually  fielded  with  infrared  (IR)  sensors  and synthetic aperture radars (SAR), these protective measures may be more challenging and complicated. 6.3.3.2.  AF/A10S  is  responsible  for  evaluating  Air  Force  HVA  Reports  and  for presenting  them  to  the  DoD  HVAG.    Subsequently,  the  Treaty  Manager  should  give guidance  to  the  DTRA  Escort  Team  Chief  in  the  event  the  proposed  observation  flight impacts an HVA. 6.3.4.  Before reporting an HVA, installation personnel and MAJCOMs need to evaluate the following: 6.3.4.1.  Can  the  activity  be  deconflicted  with  the  observation  overflight  window  of vulnerability? 6.3.4.2.  Can the activity be delayed? 6.3.4.3.  What is the cost to cancel or delay the activity? 6.3.5.  With  each  HVA  Report,  the  installation  and  the  MAJCOM  should  indicate  their recommendations associated with this HVA. 6.3.5.1.  If the HVA can be deconflicted, the  recommendation would likely be to  report the HVA for information only. 6.3.5.2.  If the installation’s preference is relief from the observing Party, the installation TCO,  through  the  MAJCOM  TCO,  will  provide  recommendations  for  the  negotiating guidance given to the DTRA Escort Team Chief. (T-2) 6.3.5.3.  If the recommendation is to avoid the HVA, then the reporting installation will provide  the  name  and  immediate  contact  information  for  the  senior  flag  officer supporting the HVA. (T-2).   This recommendation may be viewed by treaty partners as an  infringement  of  their  treaty  rights.  This  scenario  is  serious  and  should  generate guidance from the HVAG or higher. (T-2) 6.3.6.  The  OST  contains  criteria  for  mission  flight  route  negotiations  and  flight  route changes.    For  further  information  see:    OST  Article  VI,  Section  II,  paragraphs  2,  4,  and  6; and Article VIII, Section I, paragraphs 4 and 5. 6.4.  Treaty Compliance Officer (TCO) Reports 6.4.1.  If requested by the DTRA Escort Team  Chief, the TCO will make aircraft departure reports  to  the  DTRA  Operations  Center  as  soon  as  practical  after  the  observation  aircraft takes off. (T-3) 6.4.2.  The TCO will pass After Action Reports (AAR) to the MAJCOM following any OST observation activity that the installation hosts. (T-3).  The MAJCOM will pass these AARs to AF/A10S. (T-3) 6.4.3.  TCOs  will  report  security  incidents,  such  as  unauthorized  photography,  to  the  local AFOSI/security forces, their MAJCOM, and the DTRA Escort Team Chief. (T-2).  The TCO will document these incidents in any AARs. (T-2)  46 AFI16-604  31 MAY 2016 Chapter 7 MISCELLANEOUS 7.1.  Financial Management (FM) 7.1.1.  Funding.    AF/A10S  is  the  Air  Force  PEM  for  all  USAF  arms  control  treaties  and agreements’ related costs, including Open Skies. The Arms Control PE is 35145F. 7.1.1.1.  Observation  aircraft  expenses  to  include  maintenance,  operations,  and  flying hours are funded thru PE 35145F. 7.1.1.2.  Periodic  depot  maintenance, sustainment costs are typically 3400 money and are programmed by AFMC. technical  order  updates,  and  engineering 7.1.1.3.  Programming  for  modification  of  the  OC-135B  airframe  using  appropriation 3010 depends on who “owns” the requirement.  ACC may program for an OC-135B-only modification  and  programs  for  those  modification  funds  separately.    Typically,  the modification takes place at the AFMC depot/modification center and the customer should request  the  modification  be  made  to  accommodate  modernization  to  the  mission equipment. ACC and AFMC should remain vigilant to the modification requirements and program accordingly. 7.1.1.4.  The flying Unit’s Open Skies manpower authorizations are also funded from the Arms Control PE. 7.1.1.5.  Infrastructure-related  costs  to  support  Treaty  Compliance  Offices  and  the OSMPF, including associated manpower, are funded thru PE 35145F. 7.1.2.  MAJCOM Treaty Officers submit annual requests for funding under the Arms Control PE in accordance with instructions provided separately. 7.1.2.1.  ACC:  Budget for and reimburse DTRA for aircraft and aircrew-related expenses the  DTRA  mission  team  pays  for  during  an  AOM.    Note:    During  AOM’s  all  mission-related  expenses  (accommodations  and  meals  for  the  entire  deployed  crew,  fuel,  and aircraft services) are paid by DTRA. 7.2.  Manpower, Personnel, and Training 7.2.1.  Working through the AF Corporate Structure, AF/A10S in conjunction with AF/A1M determines and allocates manpower resources to  MAJCOMs to support AF implementation of, and compliance with, arms control treaties and agreements. 7.2.2.  In  accordance  with  AFI  16-601,  all  MAJCOMs  will  establish  an  office  of  primary responsibility and specific points of contact for arms control. 7.2.3.  HQ  ACC  maintains  responsibility  for  manpower  associated  with  the  flying  Unit supporting  the  observation  aircraft  to  include  filling  all  authorized  billets  and  the qualifications of flying personnel.  Of primary concern is the consistent availability of trained and  qualified  air  and  maintenance  crews  who  are  deployable  to  support  all  OST  tasked missions. 7.2.4.  HQ  AF/A2-NASIC  maintains  responsibility  for  manpower  associated  with  the OSMPF, including fulfillment of all authorized billets.  Of primary concern is the capability  AFI16-604  31 MAY 2016 47 to  support  the  processing  of  media  products  from  both  U.S.  and  foreign  OST  missions, including  the  capability  to  handle  materials  used  in  processing  of  products.    OSMPF members must be deployable for OST activities overseas. 7.2.5.  All  personnel  having  OST  responsibilities  should  take  advantage  of  appropriate training opportunities (DTRA training courses, Air Force workshops, etc.).  In addition, host installations must maintain a cadre of trained escorts to support incoming foreign OST teams. (T-2) 7.3.  Legal 7.3.1.  SAF/GCI  will  provide  legal  support  on  matters  involving  the  interpretation  and implementation  of  the  OST.    The  servicing  Staff  Judge  Advocate  to  the  Combatant Commander  or  its  Air  Component  will  provide  legal  advice  on  questions  arising  from mission planning and operations management and the review of any related documents. 7.4.  Observation Team Arrival Procedures 7.4.1.  The Wing Commander, or designated representative, will meet the visiting team upon arrival  of  an  observation  aircraft  to  a  host  installation.  (T-3)    Particular  attention  should  be paid to foreign aircraft/team members. 7.4.2.  Ensure the notification of the incoming team lists the manifest of personnel, including positions within the team  and the last six digits of the Social Security numbers for  all U.S. personnel.  The DTRA Escort Team Chief and the foreign Team Chief(s) should be readily identifiable by their name tags. 7.4.3.  The  observation  aircraft  must  be  parked  in  an  area  close  to  Base  Operations,  in  a hangar (if weather prevents required aircraft maintenance outdoors), or at another location as dictated by the security situation. (T-3).  Base Operations must position the aircraft in such a way to allow start-up and taxi to the runway without towing. (T-3) 7.4.3.1.  Towing  of  the  foreign  observation  aircraft  is  discouraged  unless  absolutely necessary  for security or maintenance.  Towing  or hangaring the foreign aircraft should be  conducted  as  a  last  resort  and  only  if  requested  by  the  foreign  Team  Chief.   If required,  and  appropriate  support  equipment  is  available,  the  foreign  maintenance personnel should complete the task using their personnel. 7.4.4.  Local  base  escorts  and  appropriate  security  forces  must  be  immediately  available  to support  the  arriving  teams.  (T-3).    Local  base  escorts  must  make  provisions  to  expedite transportation of personnel to the next event (Welcome/Arrival briefings, billeting, etc.), and movement of luggage/gear from the aircraft to the appropriate location. (T-3) 7.4.5.  The host installation TCO will present an arrival and local safety briefing as soon as practicable after arrival of the observation teams. (T-2).  The TCO will pre-coordinate these briefings with DTRA because of the requirement for translation. (T-2) 7.5.  Defector Procedures 7.5.1.  If  any  foreign  OST  team  member  indicates  their  desire  to  defect  to  an  Air  Force representative, the escort will immediately inform the DTRA Team Chief. (T-1).  The DTRA Team Chief, as the senior U.S. Government representative, will take actions as appropriate. (T-2)  48 AFI16-604  31 MAY 2016 7.5.1.1.  If the indication happens when on U.S. soil (or on a U.S. base in a host nation), the  Air  Force  hosting  unit  will  take  no  actions  unless  requested  by  the  DTRA  Escort Team  Chief.    If  the  DTRA  Escort  Team  Chief  requests  assistance,  the  TCO  will immediately  inform  installation  leadership,  base  security,  and  the  local  AFOSI representative. (T-2) 7.5.1.2.  If the indication happens outside of the U.S. while onboard the U.S. observation aircraft, immediately notify the DTRA Team Chief, who will take full responsibility for follow-on actions.  When appropriate, and as soon as possible, make situation reports to the OPCON Commander. 7.6.  Public Affairs (PA) 7.6.1.  In accordance with standing OASD(PA) guidance, the DoD PA posture is: response to inquiry only. 7.6.2.  If  media  coverage  of  Open  Skies  activities  is  accommodated,  host  units  will  do  so IAW  DOD  "Principles  of  Information,"  SAF/PA,  DTRA/PA,  OASD(PA),  and  installation PA guidance. (T-0).  Host units will consider requests by news media to cover these activities on a case-by-case basis. (T-3) 7.6.2.1.  Unit  PA  offices  will  comply  with  established  higher-level  PA  guidance  and develop an internal information plan to accommodate this guidance. (T-2) 7.6.2.2.  Local  media  interest  may  be  accommodated  on  a  not-to-interfere  basis  with Open Skies activities, and only with the DTRA Escort Team Chief’s concurrence. 7.6.2.3.  The installation PA office will keep the community aware of OST activities via routine meetings between key civic leaders and base officials. (T-3) 7.6.2.4.  Host units will use prepared news releases whenever possible using coordinated and approved language from PA guidance for Open Skies treaty authored by DTRA. (T-3) 7.6.3.  The  Defense  Media  Activity  will  coordinate  all  Armed  Forces  Radio  and  Television Service support activities to ensure continuity. 7.6.4.  In the event of a defection or death of a foreign Open Skies team member, installation PA  offices  will  refer  all  queries  to  the  Department  of  State;  No  local  comments, confirmations, etc., will be made. (T-2) 7.7.  Protocol 7.7.1.  Hosting foreign OST observation missions is a national, legal obligation.  Installation commanders  must  ensure  that  the  foreign  team  is  afforded  the  opportunity  to  exercise  its rights under the OST. (T-0).  The host installations must facilitate the conduct of the event. (T-1) 7.7.2.  Reception of the visiting OST teams should be polite, courteous, and accommodating. 7.7.3.  Observation team members typically travel under Diplomatic passports.  In any event, all  host  installation  members  must  accord  properly  designated  observation  team  personnel the  rights,  privileges,  and  immunities  outlined  in  the  OST,  Article  XIII,  and  in  the  Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 18 April 1961. (T-0)  AFI16-604  31 MAY 2016 49 7.7.4.  In  the  event  a  dignitary,  VIP,  or  flag  officer  accompanies  the  observation  activity, afford them appropriate protocol accommodations.  Host installations must coordinate these procedures with the DTRA Escort Team Chief. (T-3) 7.7.5.  Nearly  all  OST  activities  include  a  formal  dinner  or  function  outside  of  Treaty requirements.    Upon  request,  the  TCO  and  host  Unit  Protocol  Office  will  assist  the  DTRA Escort  Team  with  coordination  of  these  activities.  (T-3).    Installation  Commander  must ensure  the  appropriate  host  installation  representation  is  provided  at  a  level  commensurate with the visibility of the activity.  Host installations will not open these events to the media. (T-3) 7.7.5.1.  Gifts and/or mementoes, if exchanged at these events, should be purchased and accounted  for  using  Official  Representation  Funds  (ORF)  and  identified  in  the installation’s annual budget submission in coordination with the Wing/Unit Commander.  ORF expenditures must adhere to AFI 65-603. 7.7.5.2.  Escort personnel on a meal card must follow guidance in the Air Force Manual 65-116.  Meals consumed by Treaty escorts while TDY are already covered by per diem entitlement.    Local  escort  personnel  required  to  consume  meals  with  OST  team  will  be reimbursed as per the Defense Travel System Joint Travel Regulation. (T-0) 7.7.5.3.  Commanders  will  ensure  reimbursement  for  authorized  local  travel  is  IAW Wing/Unit local travel instructions. (T-3) 7.8.  Installation Local Activities 7.8.1.  Units  hosting  OST  activities  may  be  called  upon  to  support  or  facilitate  leisure  time activities for members of the observation teams during periods when they are not required to support  OST  functions.    Creativity,  ingenuity,  and  flexibility  on  the  part  of  the  TCO  are encouraged.  Leisure activities are part of hosting, particularly if there are significant delays in resuming a mission due to aircraft repairs, weather constraints, etc. 7.8.2.  On-base  activities  may  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  visits  to  the  Base  Exchange and/or Commissary, Class Six store, clothing sales, Officer and/or Enlisted Clubs, cafeterias and  fast-food  establishments,  museums  or  displays,  athletic  center,  or  other  recreational facilities.  If the Base Exchange and/or Commissary are visited, the TCO is responsible for crowd control and will coordinate with the facility manager to provide a separate check-out lane. (T-3).  If requested, provide cash register tapes/receipts for foreign OST team members to a DTRA escort. 7.8.2.1.  As  guests of the U.S.,  observation team  members are authorized  the use of the Base Exchange and Commissary, Class Six store, convenience stores, and Officer and/or Enlisted Clubs.  At the clothing sales store, only non-military-issue clothing/items may be purchased.  The host installation TCO will notify any of these facilities prior to the arrival of the observation team. (T-3) 7.8.2.2.  For  bases  outside  the  U.S.,  TCOs  will  allow  access  to  these  facilities  in accordance with host nation rules, regulations, and standing Status of Forces Agreements (SOFA). (T-0). 7.8.3.  Off-base activities include shopping, tourist and recreational activities, etc.  TCO must notify  AFSOI  and  base  security  about  any  off-base  activity,  including  when  the  teams  are  50 AFI16-604  31 MAY 2016 housed  off-base,  to  ensure  appropriate  coordination  with  local,  state,  or  federal  authorities. (T-2)    Base  security  forces  will  not  provide  off-base  security,  which  falls  under  the jurisdiction of the local, state, or federal authorities. (T-0) 7.8.3.1.  The  DTRA  Escort  Team  has  sole  responsibility  for  all  visiting  OST  personnel during on- and off-base activities. 7.8.3.2.  If  requested  by  the  DTRA  Escort  Team  Chief,  the  TCO  may  provide,  as available,  local  base  escorts  and  drivers  to  facilitate  movement  off-base.    This  does  not relieve the base of the responsibility to provide transportation for the observation teams, but allows them flexibility if the DTRA Escort Team Chief does not require this type of assistance. 7.9.  Installation Escort Procedures 7.9.1.  Local  escorts  are  required  to  assist  the  DTRA  Escort  Team  and  to  facilitate  OST activities/events when foreign observation teams and/or aircraft and crews are operating from their installation. (T-3). 7.9.2.  Local  escorts  are  site-knowledgeable  base  representatives  designated  as  points  of contact for the DTRA Escort Team.  Ensure local escorts are in the grades of E-4 and above and are supervised by senior NCOs (E-7 or above), officers, or civilians.  While no specific certification is necessary, Commanders must select mature individuals. (T-3) 7.9.3.  Host units should provide local escorts to support OST activities/events as follows: 7.9.3.1.  Wing  Commanders  at  U.S.  Air  Force  bases  hosting  OST  activities/events  will assign local escorts to assist the TCO and DTRA Escort and foreign observation teams in their movement on and off the property under the responsibility of the Wing Commander. (T-2) 7.9.3.2.  Local  escorts  will  report  to  the  TCO  and  be  relieved  of  all  other  assigned responsibilities while performing escort duties associated with OST activities/events. (T-3).  Units will have a qualified medical escort assigned throughout the OST activity. (T-2) 7.9.3.3.  The  TCO  will  maintain  a  current  list  of  local  escorts,  and  designate  and  train replacements  as  necessary  to  ensure  continuous  availability  of  escorts  for  short-notice OST activities. (T-2) 7.9.3.4.  Local escorts must have, as a minimum, a Secret security clearance and access to restricted  areas  where  OS  aircraft  may  be  parked.  (T-2).    A  sufficient  number  of  local escorts must have restricted-area (i.e., flight line, etc.) driving privileges. (T-2) 7.9.3.5.  Local escorts are not expected to be trained as security specialists; however, they must  be  trained  to  recognize  and  react  to  anticipated  elicitation  and  human  intelligence (HUMINT) gathering techniques. (T-3).  OPSEC procedures still apply. 7.9.3.6.  Local  escorts  are  not  expected  to  be  conversant  about  OST  information,  U.S. Government  policies  concerning  OST  issues,  or  the  conduct  of  OST  activities  at  other USAF OST airfields. 7.9.3.7.  Local  escorts  have  two  responsibilities  while  on  base:  (1)  the  protection  and safety of visiting OST personnel, and (2) the security of site facilities.  Local escorts must  AFI16-604  31 MAY 2016 51 limit  access  of personnel not  needed to  support the OST mission from  areas supporting OST activities/events. (T-3) 7.9.3.8.  Local  escorts  will  wear  visible,  distinctive  badges  when  in  the  company  of visiting OST personnel. (T-3).  These badges are for identification as treaty escorts only, and shall not include the escort’s name. (T-3) 7.9.3.9.  Host  installations  will  ensure  local  escorts/drivers  are  never  left  alone  with foreign OST personnel. (T-3) 7.9.3.10.  Local escorts will not accept DTRA Escort responsibilities. (T-3) 7.9.3.11.  Local  escorts  shall  be  knowledgeable  enough  to  facilitate  movement  of  the visiting  OST  teams  to  and  from  scheduled  activities,  the  flight  line,  medical  facilities, dining facilities, billeting, and to on- and off-base shopping locations. (T-3) 7.9.3.12.  Local  escorts  will  be  knowledgeable  in  base  security  procedures,  access requirements to the base, and flight line. (T-3) 7.9.3.13.  Local escorts should be flexible and patient, as plans often change.  They will have  constant  communications  capability  with  the  TCO  to  report  unexpected  situations and to seek guidance. (T-3) 7.9.3.14.  Local  escorts  may  volunteer  for  off  base/cultural  events  if  requested  by  the DTRA Escort Team Chief and approved by the installation TCO. 7.10.  Medical and Dental Support / Mortuary Services 7.10.1.  Host  installations  are  expected  to  provide  or  arrange  for  emergency/non-elective medical/dental care as necessary and as requested by the DTRA Escort Team Chief.  Medical support  may  be  required  to  enable  team  members  to  accomplish  their  duties,  save  lives  or stabilize injuries.  Installations must use military treatment facilities to the maximum extent possible  unless  the  severity  of  the  illness/injury  and/or  military  medical  authorities  deem otherwise. (T-2) 7.10.2.  If  transportation  to  a  local  civilian  medical  facility  is  required,  a  DTRA  escort  will accompany  the  individual  to  the  local  facility  and  remain  with  them  until  care  is  rendered.  The military medical staff coordinates care with the civilian facility as needed.  The DTRA Escort will keep the DTRA Team Chief apprised of the patient’s condition and treatment at all times. (T-2) 7.10.3.  If  the  member  requiring  medical/dental  care  is  an  aircrew  member,  notify  the  host installation’s Flight Surgeon’s office. 7.10.4.  Accomplish  transportation  to  an  appropriate  POX,  if  required,  via  usual  air evacuation  procedures  after  coordination  with  the  DTRA  Escort  Team  Chief  and  foreign Team Chief. 7.10.5.  In  the  event  of  the  death  of  an  observation  team  member,  the  DTRA  Escort  Team Chief will provide any and all guidance.  Do not report the death through any channels until cleared  by  the  DTRA  Escort  Team  Chief.    Before  making  arrangements  for  mortuary services,  the  TCO  will  consult  applicable  U.S.  Air  Force  regulations,  local  and  state  laws, U.S.-host  nation  arrangements,  foreign  preferences,  the  DTRA  Escort  Team  Chief,  and  the servicing staff judge advocate (SJA). (T-1)  52 AFI16-604  31 MAY 2016 7.10.5.1.  The TCO will, after being cleared by the DTRA Escort Team Chief, report any death  to  the  MAJCOM  Treaty  Office  and  to  AF/A10S  (DSN  (312)  224-0676  or usaf.pentagon.af-a10.mbx.A10S-open-skies@mail.mil)  as  soon  as  practicable,  along with circumstances of the death. (T-1) 7.10.5.2.  The installation will initiate OPREPs/SITREPs detailing the serious injuries or death  of  an  observation  team  member  as  soon  as  practical,  in  coordination  with  the DTRA Escort Team Chief.  Include AF/A10S as an addressee. (T-1) 7.10.6.  The  Installation  TCO  and  DTRA  liaison  will  ensure  all  medical  care  provided  to  a non-U.S.  member  is  billed  according  to  any  host  nation  agreements.  (T-0)    The  civilian health care facility should bill all civilian medical care provided to a non-U.S. member to the nearest consulate office of the country that the member is from or to DTRA. 7.11.  Installation Security 7.11.1.  Foreign  observation  team  members  typically  travel  under  Diplomatic  passports.    In any  event,  accord  designated  observation  team  personnel  the  rights,  privileges,  and immunities outlined in the OST, Article XIII.  As such, they, their accommodations, personal gear,  and  baggage  are  immune  from  search  and  seizure  while  they  are  on  U.S.  territory.  Additionally, no foreign team member may be arrested or detained. 7.11.2.  The  foreign  observation  team  is  identified  by  the  DTRA  Escort  Team  Chief  at  the POE.  Their equipment will be searched at the POE by DTRA and U.S. Customs personnel.  Further searches are prohibited and any questions concerning searching should be directed to the  DTRA  Escort  Team  Chief.    Note:    This  does  not  exempt  the  aircraft,  air  crews,  and mission teams from agricultural inspection requirement. 7.11.3.  DTRA  team  members,  their  luggage,  and  hand-carried  items  are  exempt  from searches  unless  dictated  by  a  specific  base  security  situation.    Note:    This  does  not  exempt the  aircraft,  air  crews,  and  mission  teams  from  the  Hawaii  agricultural  inspection requirement. 7.11.4.  It is Air Force policy that if no specific threat exists against the observation team or the host installation before or during their visit, additional security requirements are neither warranted  nor  appropriate.    Treatment  of  the  observation  team  as  distinguished  visitors should be sufficient. 7.11.5.  It is Air Force policy that the local base escort team has the primary responsibility for ensuring  the  protection  and  safety  of  observation  team  members  and  for  limiting  access  to them by non-essential personnel while on the host installation. 7.11.6.  If  a  threat  arises  before  or  during  the  visit  of  an  observation  team,  the  host installation will react appropriately, inform the DTRA Escort Team Chief (prior to arrival if possible), and brief the arriving team of the situation, the precautions they should take, and the protective measures being taken by the base. (T-2) 7.11.7.  If a threat exists during an OST activity at a host installation, consider billeting the observation team on-base and, depending on the threat, limiting/restricting their movement as much  as  possible.    If  a  credible  threat  exists  to  OST  activities  and  movement  to  off-base location  is  necessary,  base  Security  Forces  will  advise  AFOSI  and  local  law  enforcement agencies. (T2)  AFI16-604  31 MAY 2016 53 7.11.8.  If a credible threat exists, treaty activities may be restricted to on-base and Security Forces personnel posted on the boundaries of areas used for lodging, dining, and other treaty activities.  Off-base activities require coordination with local law enforcement.  If the threat warrants, pass this information expeditiously to AF/A10S.  If required, the Air Staff will pass a recommendation to consider terminating the visit and removing the visitors from the area to the USG Interagency. (T-2) 7.11.9.  Foreign  observation  aircraft  do  not  carry  an  assigned  physical  security  protection level in accordance with AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense (classified FOUO); however, they should be protected as any foreign state aircraft.  If the aircraft is to remain on station for a period of time, the installation must provide appropriate security protection measures. (T-2) 7.12.  Photography 7.12.1.  The Air Force photography policy for OST activities on host installation facilities is identified  in  the  following  subparagraphs.    This  policy  is  designed  to  address  photography primarily  during  aircraft  inspections  at  U.S.  Air  Force  airfields  hosting  OST  observation missions.  Specifically, it covers the foreign teams taking photography of the U.S. inspection of their aircraft and for the U.S. team (from DTRA) to record the inspection process for the foreign teams, if so requested by the foreign team. 7.12.1.1.  The public affairs office is responsible for all visual information activities at the installation and must be coordinated with prior to all OST activities. (T-2) 7.12.2.  Under the OST, the observed (i.e., hosting) State Party has the right to conduct a pre-flight inspection of the foreign observation aircraft and sensors to ensure that they conform to the aircraft and sensors that  were previously  certified for observation flights and have been notified for use for observation activities. 7.12.2.1.  It  has  become  the  practice  of  the  parties  to  allow  the  observing  (i.e.,  hosted) State  Party  to  record  the  inspection  process  as  it  is  being  conducted  by  observed  party inspectors.  However, the Public Affairs office must coordinate all photography with the installation TCO and the DTRA Escort Team Chief prior to any photographic activities. (T-2) 7.12.2.2.  Equipment  capable  of  recording  images  for  this  purpose  has  historically included cameras.   Public Affairs, installation TCO, and DTRA Escort Team Chief will not  allow  video  cameras  to  be  used  by  the  hosted  State  Party  to  record  the  aircraft inspection process. (T-1) 7.12.2.3.  Base  Public  Affairs  and/or  local  media  activities  recording  aircraft  inspection must be pre-coordinated with the Wing Commander, the installation TCO, and the DTRA Escort Team Chief. (T-2) 7.12.3.  While  this  photography  policy  does  not  override  other  Air  Force  photography policies,  it  does  allow  the  U.S.  Escort  Team,  foreign  team  members,  and  U.S.  Technical Equipment Inspection (TEI) personnel to take photographs of the observation aircraft during the aircraft inspection and, if desired, to  document via photography the status of the sensor covers upon arrival at a POE, after a transit flight to an OSA, and prior to departure from a POX.    As  this  is  an  official  Treaty  activity,  all  photography  equipment  should  be  declared and state owned.  54 AFI16-604  31 MAY 2016 7.12.3.1.  At  all  other  times  than  aircraft  inspection  and  recording  condition  of  sensor covers, photography must be coordinated between the DTRA Escort Team Chief and the installation TCO, who requests approval from appropriate base agencies. (T-2) 7.12.3.2.  Submit requests for other mission-related or treaty-related photography as soon as  the  need  is  known.    TCOs  must  have  pre-established  coordination  procedures  to expeditiously process requests and be able to advise on expected response time from base agencies. (T-3) 7.12.3.3.  Past  experience  indicates  foreign  observation  teams  might  attempt  to  take pictures,  which—except  during  the  recording  of  the  aircraft  inspection  process—may contradict current base policies.  Photographs are likely to be taken, upon arrival/landing at an airfield and on the ground during various arrival activities.  TCOs must review the latest  HQ  USAF  photography  guidance  for  clarification  of  appropriate  procedures  for managing and reporting photography violations. (T-1) 7.12.4.  This  photography  policy  does  not  give  a  third  party  (i.e.,  installation  or  other observers)  authorization  to  photograph  the  aircraft  inspection  process  or  other  mission-related  activity  on  the  flight  line  unless  pre-coordinated  with  the  DTRA  Escort  and  the foreign Team Chiefs. 7.12.4.1.  Installation  or  MAJCOM  personnel  may  take  photographs  of  OST  activities after satisfying the local approval process and after coordination between the installation TCO  and  the  DTRA  Escort  Team  Chief,  who  will  coordinate  with  the  foreign  Team Chief.  (T-3).    The  DTRA  Escort  Team  Chief  and  the  Installation  TCO  should  also coordinate and obtain approval for the group photo from the foreign Team Chief. 7.12.4.1.1.  It  is  routine  practice  of  the  States  Parties  to  take  a  posed  group photograph of the observation teams with installation hosts and local escorts in front of  the  observation  aircraft  while  at  the  base,  if  practical  and  weather  permitting.  Installation  commander  will  ensure  the  installation  TCO  pre-coordinates  this  photo with the DTRA liaison installation PA, and local media processing facilities prior to arrival of the aircraft. (T-3) 7.12.4.2.  Uncoordinated or unapproved photography of the foreign team and aircraft may become a diplomatic issue for the USG to address. 7.12.5.  As  any  deviation  from  established  treaty  practices  can  have  undesirable  diplomatic effects, photography of the aircraft inspection process, to include documenting sensor cover status before/after transit flights, is considered as exceptional circumstances and is allowed to continue to the extent possible within the constraints of standing Air Force security guidance and installation policies. 7.12.5.1.  Local  Commanders  often  authorize  instances  of  flight  line  photography  to support  USG  activities.    DTRA  Escort  Teams  receive  this  authorization  specifically  to support  only  Open  Skies  pre-flight  inspection  requirements.    For  any  additional photography,  pre-coordinate  with  the  installation  TCO  who  can  advise  of  requirements and, when necessary, forward the request for consideration by appropriate authority. 7.12.5.2.  Installation Commanders should normally support these activities while making prudent efforts to protect security concerns.  AFI16-604  31 MAY 2016 55 7.12.5.3.  When unexpected circumstances occur in which Commanders may be expected to  further limit  photography, installation TCOs  will expeditiously  report to  MAJCOMs.  MAJCOMS will report to AF/A10S, the circumstances, rationale, and results as quickly as possible. (T-2) 7.12.5.4.  Since prohibiting customary photography may be viewed by treaty partners as an  infringement  of  their  treaty  rights,  AF/A10S  will  rapidly  report  the  circumstances  to AF A10, SAF/GCI, the Joint Staff, OSD Policy, and the OUSD(AT&L) Treaty Manager. AF/A10S will also prepare responses to USG Interagency questions as appropriate. 7.12.6.  The  U.S.  Escort  Team  and  the  base  escort  team  will  monitor  the  use  of  portable equipment capable of recording images. (T-1). 7.12.6.1.  To facilitate understanding between all parties, the TCO will explicitly inform the  DTRA  Escort  Team  Chief  of  the  policies  applicable  to  that  airfield.    The  TCO  will specifically  brief  the  arriving  U.S.  and  foreign  observation  teams  on  the  local photography  policies  and  procedures  applicable  to  the  airfield  and  is  responsible  for ensuring compliance with these policies. (T-2) 7.12.6.2.  Photography will be carefully managed. (T-3). 7.12.6.2.1.  Photographs will be oriented or framed to ensure only the intended image is taken. (T-3) 7.12.6.3.  The  installation  TCO  must  attempt  to  limit  unwanted  imagery  collection  by parking the Open Skies aircraft to avoid photography of other assets in the vicinity. (T-3) 7.12.6.3.1.  The observation aircraft can be placed in an isolated area away from other aircraft/buildings  or  shrouded  by  innocuous  structures.    In  addition,  other  more sensitive aircraft can be placed in a secure hangar, in an isolated area away from other aircraft/buildings, or shrouded by innocuous structures. 7.12.7.  If there are any violations of this photography policy, bring them to the attention of the  DTRA  Escort  Team  Chief,  who  will  address  them  immediately  with  the  foreign  Team Chief (if the violation is by the foreign team) or the individual involved (if the violation is by a member of the U.S. Escort Team). 7.12.7.1.  The  observing  party  has  a  duty  to  respect  the  laws  and  regulations  of  the observed party. 7.12.7.2.  Installation TCOs and any supporting members will brief such incidents to the base security forces, document them in the After Action Report (AAR), and provided to MAJCOM and Air Force Treaty Offices. (T-2) 7.12.8.  The OST, Article XIII, Section  II, Paragraph 1,  gives  foreign inspectors diplomatic privileges and immunities, including the inviolability of their person and personal property.  This means that to touch them or their property may violate their Treaty rights. 7.12.8.1.  At no time should personal property be confiscated or involuntarily taken from the foreign inspectors. 7.12.9.  Nothing  in  this  policy  authorizes  or  encourages  overt  intelligence  collection  or  the allowance of intelligence collection by photography.  56 AFI16-604  31 MAY 2016 7.13.  Operational Security (OPSEC) 7.13.1.  OPSEC  is  a  process  of  identifying,  analyzing,  and  controlling  critical  information indicating actions associated with military operations and other activities to: 7.13.1.1.  Identify those actions that can be observed by adversary intelligence systems; 7.13.1.2.  Determine  what  specific  indications  could  be  collected,  analyzed,  and interpreted to derive critical information to be useful to adversaries; and, 7.13.1.3.  Select and execute measures that eliminate or reduce to an acceptable level the vulnerabilities of actions to adversary exploitation. 7.13.2.  The  purpose  of  OPSEC  is  to  reduce  the  vulnerability  of  Air  Force  missions  to successful adversary collection and exploitation of critical information.  OPSEC applies to all activities  that  prepare,  sustain,  or  employ  forces  during  all  phases  of  operations.    (AFI  10-701, Operations Security (OPSEC)) 7.13.3.  It is not unexpected that members of foreign observation teams may attempt to gather information on our abilities, capabilities, operations, intentions, personnel, and organizations.  It  is  incumbent  on our host installation personnel to  be observant  and diligent  in  protecting information  that  might  be  used  to  compromise  our  security,  while  at  the  same  time  being courteous and pleasant. 7.13.4.  The host installation’s escort will notify the TCO, who will in turn notify the DTRA Escort  Team  Chief,  if  inquiries  or  actions  of  a  foreign  observation  team  member  raise suspicions. (T-3).  TCOs will notify Base Security Forces representatives of any suspicious situations. (T-3) 7.14.  Lodging and Messing 7.14.1.  Host  installation  TCOs  will  coordinate  lodging  and  messing  requirements/desires with the DTRA Escort Team Chief or his or her designated representative; however, the TCO may not always be able to accommodate desires. (T-3) 7.14.2.  DTRA prefers to billet OST teams off-base in a hotel that can accommodate both the entire  U.S.  and  foreign  teams.    Coordination  for  off-base  lodging,  if  arranged  by  the  host TCO,  should  be  through  the  base  Lodging  Office.    The  TCO  may  be  required  to  facilitate   non-availability letters for the observation team members for off-base lodging. (T-3) 7.14.2.1.  DTRA  will  coordinate  with  the  TCO  for  all  lodging  support  to  ensure  local installation/hotel contracts are adhered to. 7.14.3.  In  the  event  of  a  threat  situation,  arrange  lodging  in  on-base  facilities.    This  may involve creativity due to the short-notice nature of OST activities and the relatively large size of the observation teams. (T-2) 7.14.4.  For  on-base  lodging,  certain  precautionary  measures  may  be  taken  in  preparing  the rooms, but extraordinary measures are not necessarily appropriate.  The TCO will coordinate with  the  DTRA  Escort  Team  Chief  regarding  lodging  requirements  (such  as  housekeeping services, telephones, security protection and availability of a 24-hour on-site contact). (T-3) 7.14.5.  TCOs  will  coordinate  meals,  both  on-  and  off-base,  with  the  DTRA  Escort  Team Chief or his or her designated representative. (T-3)  AFI16-604  31 MAY 2016 57 7.14.6.  U.S. observation team members will pay for their own accommodations and meals. (T-3). DTRA Escort Team Class A Agent will pay for the foreign team members. 7.14.7.  The installation TCO will work with the Flight Kitchen to arrange for box lunches as requested by the DTRA Escort Team Chief. (T-3).  The TCO will coordinate with the DTRA Escort Team to facilitate payment for box lunches, typically in advance. (T-3) 7.15.  Transportation 7.15.1.  The  host-installation  TCO  will  coordinate  transportation  requirements  with  the DTRA Escort Team Chief or his or her designated representative. (T-2) 7.15.1.1.  OST  activities  are  conducted  on  a  strict  timeline.    The  host-installation  TCO will ensure transportation accounts for road closures, base gate security procedures, and traffic situations to ensure adherence to this timeline. (T-2).  Pad transportation timelines to account for inclement weather, traffic, or other unexpected delays.  The OST activity must accommodate these situations. 7.15.1.2.  The  TCO  will  attempt  to  accommodate  the  DTRA  Team  Chief’s  requests  for support of transportation for off-base and cultural activities for the foreign teams as much as  practical  and  within  existing  policies/guidelines/restrictions.  (T-2).    In  cases  where installation Commander approval is needed for the type of activity or location, the TCO will facilitate that request. (T-2) 7.15.2.  Determine the number and size of vehicles required the activities being performed. 7.15.2.1.  For  initial  arrival,  departure,  and  movement  to/from  lodging  for  the  first/last time, provide a separate van or truck for luggage. (T-3) 7.15.2.2.  For full team movements, such as to/from cultural events, a VIP coach/bus may be appropriate. 7.15.2.3.  Separate vehicles for the air and maintenance crews may be needed. 7.15.3.  A cadre of qualified drivers must be available for the duration of the OST activity. (T-2) 7.15.4.  Contract  support  personnel  are  authorized  use  of  Government  general  purpose (cars/vans)  vehicles  for  OST  activities.   Contract  support  personnel  must  comply  with  AF vehicle training  and authorization. (T-3). flightline  driving training/licensing requirements to include 7.16.  Weather Support 7.16.1.  The  observation  team  requires  up-to-date  weather  data.    All  flight  weather  briefing elements will conform to World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and International Civil Aviation  Organization  (ICAO)  standards  and  be  reported  in  both  U.S.  standard  (inches  of mercury  (Hg)  and feet)  and metric (millimeters  of Hg and meters) units  where  appropriate. (T-2) 7.16.2.  The host Unit Weather Flight will provide weather briefings at all OST airfields. (T-3).  The 88th Operations Support Squadron (88 OSS) from Wright-Patterson AFB, OH will provide weather briefings at Dulles IAP POE/POX. (T-1).  The 88 OSS representatives will  58 AFI16-604  31 MAY 2016 provide  Dulles  briefings  on-site  or  by  web-based  presentations  as  requested  by  the  DTRA Escort Team Chief. (T-1) 7.16.3.  Specific guidance for weather support to foreign Open Skies teams at U.S. OSAs and OSRAs is detailed below. 7.16.4.  The installation Weather Flight will provide or arrange for weather support required by OST personnel during Treaty activities at or originating from the host airfield as follows: 7.16.4.1.  Develop a briefing providing local, take-off, en route, and arrival weather using DD  Form  175-1,  Flight  Weather  Briefing.  (T-1).    In  addition,  the  Installation  Weather Flight will be prepared to brief/provide local weather for other OSAs and OSRAs. (T-1) 7.16.4.2.  Provide a weather briefing to the observation team upon its arrival at the host airfield, daily weather briefings as requested, and pilot weather briefings prior to missions and training activities. (T-1) 7.16.4.2.1.  A sample Open Skies weather briefing is available from AF/A10S. 7.16.4.3.  Provide daily weather briefings detailing the current and forecasted weather for the  entire  mission  period  to  include  applicable  satellite  and  radar  imagery,  current  and forecasted  surface  maps,  and  an  outlook  for  the  local  area  and  other  OSA/OSRA,  as requested. (T-1) 7.16.4.3.1.  All weather briefings should use general terms or cardinal directions (e.g., north,  northeast,  southwest,  and  central)  to  illustrate  the  location  of  weather phenomena. 7.16.4.4.  Provide  OST  personnel  weather  charts  depicting surface  pressure, temperatures,  and  winds;  charts  depicting  heights,  temperatures,  and  winds  at  850 millibars (mb), 700 mb, 500 mb, 300 mb, and 200 mb; relative humidity fields at 850 mb; and  solar  azimuth  and  elevation  data.  (T-3).    Coordinate  additions/deletions  to  this package with the DTRA Escort Team Chief as needed, depending on the mission profile.  Provide data packages at the initial weather brief and updated daily or upon request. (T-1) 7.16.4.5.  Provide  weather  consultation  services  to  help  OST  personnel  understand  the current and forecasted weather situation to include expected areas of cloud cover. (T-1) 7.16.4.6.  Provide  weather  parameters  (surface  pressure  and  flight  level  outside  air temperature) for overflight areas as requested. (T-1) 7.16.4.7.  Provide  flight  weather  briefings  using  DD  Forms  175-1  for  aircrews.  (T-2).  OST  pilots  must  furnish  aircraft  type  and  call  sign,  time  of  departure,  flight  level,  and planned primary and alternate destinations. (T-2) 7.16.4.8.  Arrange for weather support when support is not available locally. (T-1) 7.16.4.9.  Provide  local  weather  support  IAW  the  host  airfield  Compliance  Plan  or Instruction. (T-2) 7.16.5.  For  Air  Force  operations  at  foreign  airfields,  once  in  country  at  non-Air  Force operated OST airfields, Air Force aircrews shall attempt to use local weather services. (T-3).  In  accordance  with  OST,  Article  VI,  Section  I,  Paragraph  13,  the  observed  State  Party  is required  to  provide  the  most  recent  weather  forecast  and  air  navigation  information  upon  AFI16-604  31 MAY 2016 59 arrival of the observing party’s aircraft at the declared POE.  If no local weather services are available, crews will use the servicing AF Operational Weather Squadron (OWS). (T-2) 7.16.6.  For  U.S.  observation  aircraft  operations  in  the  3AF  Area  of  Responsibility  (AOR), the 21 OWS from Kapaun AS in the Kaiserslautern Military Community (KMC), Germany provides  weather  support  services.    Designated  weather  units  will  provide  weather  support and  services  to    deploying  U.S.  OST  flight  crews  at  both  the  European  Gateway  and  the Alaska Gateway for U.S. observation missions in Russia. (T-1) 7.16.6.1.  This  support  will  include  a  21  OWS  representative  who  can  respond  to questions  regarding  the  weather  package,  which  includes  weather  information  for  the entire flight route from the Gateway to the POE.
