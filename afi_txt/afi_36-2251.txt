Scope.This instruction provides the guidance for managing Air Force Training Systems.  It outlines the requirement to develop, acquire, modify, test, validate, and support training systems, to include but not  limited  to  Aircrew  Mission  Training  Systems,  Mission  Crew  (i.e.  Command  and  Control  (C2)) Training Systems, Maintenance Training Systems, Space Training Systems, other Training Systems and Training  Services.    This  AFI  must  be  used  in  conjunction  with  AFI  10-601,  Capabilities-Based Requirements Development, and AFI 99-103, Capabilities-Based Test and Evaluation, and AFI 63-101, Operations  of  Capabilities  Based  Acquisition  System  to  provide  an  integrated  framework  for  the implementation of a training system. 1.2.  System Development.Training systems are developed using the integrated management framework outlined  in  this  AFI.    Training  systems  must  follow  approriate  guidance  in  regards  to  acquisition, programming, requirements, and test IAW the references in Attachment 1.  The following concepts and terms  are  included  to  communicate  DoD  perspective  and  intentions.  All  training  systems  shall incorporate the intent of the following: 1.2.1.  Requirements Development. 1.2.1.1.  IAW DoD 5000-series directives and instructions, CJCSI/M 3170.01, Joint Capabilities Integration  and  Development  System,  and  AFI  10-601,  Capabilities-Based  Requirements Development,  all  training  systems  considered  acquisition  programs  must  follow  prescribed acquisition and requirements development direction and policy.  See Attachment 1 for a list of all referenced guidance.  Training system requirements shall consider the role of the weapon system and  combat/mission  crew  in  the  operational  environment  to  determine  the  extent  of interoperability to be designed into the training system.  Use a comparison of Mission Essential Competencies to help determine interoperability requirements.  Possible effects on other parts of the system shall  be considered when decisions are made  that  primarily concern  one part  of the system.    For  example,  the  effects  on  unit  training  shall  be  a  key  consideration  in  decisions  on institutional training.  Training systems/programs should be developed according to AFMAN 36-2234, Instructional System Development (ISD).  Additionally, ensure the Air Force Career Field Managers  (AFCFMs)  and  Air  Education  &  Training  Command  (AETC)  Training  Pipeline Managers  (TPMs)  are  included  in  developing  and  implementing  formal  training  requirements through the Utilization and Training Workshop (U&TW) as detailed in AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training, and Volume 5, Career Field Education and Training. 1.2.2.  Management of Training Programs. 1.2.2.1.    Simulators  and  other  training  devices  for  prime  mission  systems  shall  be  developed, procured, distributed, and used when supported by the ISD analysis.  Particular emphasis shall be placed on simulators that provide training of tasks that might be limited by safety considerations or constraints on training space, time, or other resources.   When deciding on simulation issues, the primary consideration shall be on improving the quality of training, safety,  and the state of readiness. 1.2.2.2.  Program Managers (PMs) will execute training system acquisitions IAW DoDI 5000.2, Operation of the Defense Acquisition System, and Air Force acquisition policies. 4 AFI36-2251  3 JUNE 2009 1.2.2.3.    Program  Managers  will  ensure  training  devices  are  supported  IAW  AFI  63-111, Contract Support for Systems, Equipment and End-Items, (Contract Logistics Support (CLS) or Contract Sustainment Support (CSS)). 1.2.3.    Distributed  Mission  Operations  (DMO)  allows  for  routine  unit  level  training  activity  by linking  live,  virtual,  and  constructive  elements  and  training  systems  within  and  across  weapon system  platforms.    DMO  capabilities  may  be  used  to  accomplish  Major  Weapon  System  (MWS) training table activity, specific mission rehearsal, and test and evaluation of tactics, techniques and procedures.  Distributed Mission Operations is also a readiness initiative to train warfighters as they expect  to  fight,  maintain  combat  readiness  at  home  or  deployed,  conduct  mission  rehearsals  in  an environment as operationally realistic as necessary, and provide support to operations.  Commanders will  use  DMO  to  prepare  and  assess  Aerospace  Expeditionary  Forces  (AEF)  and  to  prepare  and certify  Air  and  Space  Operations  Centers  (AOCs),  including  Joint  Force  Air  Component Commanders  (JFACCs),  for  real-world  missions.    As  an  integration  effort,  DMO  will  primarily leverage  existing  and  emerging  programs  and  technologies  to  fill  gaps  in  total-team  training, rehearsal, and operations support. AFI36-2251  3 JUNE 2009 5 Chapter 2 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.

It is recommended that TPT meetings be held annually.  Open/unresolved training  system/DMO  quality  and  concurrency  issues  will  be  reviewed  at  all  TPT  meetings.    This meeting  will  review  and  document  training  system  quality  and  concurrency.    The  TPT  shall  be established  sufficiently  early  to  support  development  of  the  system  acquisition  strategy,  preferably  as 10 AFI36-2251  3 JUNE 2009 early as Milestone A or Key Decision Point (KDP) A.  The TPT Chair, usually the LC, will coordinate on training system/DMO acquisition strategies developed by the individual training system PM. 3.2.1.  TPT Composition.  At a minimum, the TPT should include the individual training system PM, Using Command(s), specifically, AETC TPMs and TMs, prime weapon system program office, Air Force  Human  Systems  Integration  Office,  and  TSPG/STAO  (for  space  systems)  representatives.  The  TPT  Chair  should  include  representatives  from  test  and  evaluation  agencies,  validation  and certification  agencies,  AFRC,  ANG,  other  Services,  applicable  laboratories,  and  designated contractor personnel, as needed. The TPT Chair shall clearly define the composition of the TPT and the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  each  member,  and  delegate  those  responsibilities  if  desired.    The Using  Commands  are  responsible  for  providing  mission  Subject  Matter  Experts  (SMEs)  and Instructional  System  Development  (ISD)  expertise.    The  LC  is  responsible  for  balancing  TPT requirements with current fiscal policy and for advocating for resources within the Lead Command and  Higher  Headquarters.    The  TPT  Chair  shall  approve  the  TPT  minutes  and  the  STP  with  the coordination of all the UCs and the individual training system PM as a minimum. AFI36-2251  3 JUNE 2009 11 Chapter 4 SYSTEM TRAINING PLAN (STP) 4.1.    General  Instructions.The  Lead  Command,  via  the  TPT,  will  develop,  maintain,  and  review  an STP  for  a  prime  mission  system.    The  STP  for  each  prime  mission  system  will  include  any  DMO training  requirements.    The  STP  shall  be  used  to  support  acquisition  and  modification  processes, requirement documents, and milestone decisions. Attachment  2 outlines the considerations and format for developing an STP.  As a minimum, key training system performance, schedule, and cost elements identified  in  the  STP  will  be  included  in  prime  mission  system  program  lifecycle  management documents,  e.g.  the  LCMP.    STP  development  shall  use  data  collected  from  the  Training  Systems Requirements Analysis (TSRA), which must be started as early as practicable after Milestone A or Key Decision Point (KDP) A. 4.2.  STPs for Emerging Prime Mission Systems.For planning, programming, and budgeting purposes, the LC shall initiate the STP through a TPT as soon as possible after Milestone A or KDP A.  The LC can  delegate  some  STP  creation  duties  to  other  organizations  as  necessary.

Programs:Simulator  certification  (SIMCERT)  ensures that  Air  Force  prime  mission  system simulators/services  and  their  components  support  accurate  and  credible  training  for  allocated  tasks, missions,  and  events  including  DMO  activity,  through  verification  and  validation  of  training  system hardware  and  software  performance.  Simulator  validation  (SIMVAL)  verifies  and  validates  the performance  of  the  simulated  mission  environments  employed  in  training  systems.    Each  of  these programs  compare  the  training  system  with  the  prime  mission  system  to  establish  and  to  document concurrency  baselines.    They  support  both  stand-alone  unit  level  training  and  distributed  training  in  a DMO  activity.    Collectively,  they  provide  the  commander  with  the  status  of  the  capabilities  and limitations of assigned training systems and environments.  SIMCERT  and SIMVAL provide an audit trail  for  measuring  system  effectiveness  and  quality  assurance  of  contractor  supported  training  or equipment.  Observe the following guidance: 6.1.1.  General.  Lead Commands (LCs) shall determine which training systems, DMO activity, and services require a SIMCERT or SIMVAL program and the frequency of these programs. 6.1.2.  Using Commands (UCs), to include ANG and AFRC.  UCs should coordinate and align their SIMCERT program with the prime mission equipment SIMCERT program, where appropriate. 6.1.3.    Distributed  Training  Systems  and  Services.    If  the  training  system/service  connects  to  a distributed training network, federate, or federation, the LC/UC shall: 6.1.3.1.    Evaluate  each  system’s  ability  to  provide  training  that  is  realistic,  secure,  and approximates the full capabilities of the weapons system. 6.1.3.2.  Establish the requirements for the federate and federation to include training objectives, interoperability objectives, and criteria. 6.1.3.3.  Ensure fidelity of the distributed environment supports realisitic and secure training and simulates the full capabilities of the integrated force. 6.1.3.4.    Ensure  the  training  device  introduces  no  anomalous  or  unwanted  artifacts  into  the training network. 6.2.  SIMCERT Programs.The LC, with assistance from appropriate agencies such as the UC, TSPG or STAO  (for  space  systems)  and  product  or  materiel  group,  shall  establish  training  system  certification requirements,  to  include  training  tasks,  criteria,  and  certification  interval.    An  overview  of  the certification  requirements  should  be  included  in  the  STP.    Each  LC  SIMCERT  program  shall  be documented in a Master SIMCERT plan IAW MAJCOM supplements to this AFI or in accordance with AFI  16-1001,  Verification,  Validation  and  Accreditation  (VV&A).    Units  will  complete  initial certification  of  training  devices  within  120  days  or  as  determined  by  the  Lead  Command  following delivery  of  a  new  training  system  or  upon  fielding  major  modifications  to  existing  training  systems.  SIMCERTS will be reaccomplished throughout the life cycle of the system, and each certification will focus on training fidelity.  The early implementation of the SIMCERT program is critical to ensure the intended  quality  of  the training is  delivered and  maintained  during  the lifespan  of  the  training  system.  The V&V reports generated by the SIMCERT program support the accreditation authority’s decision to accredit the associated training system for its intended use. 14 AFI36-2251  3 JUNE 2009 6.3.  SIMVAL Programs.  The LC, with assistance from appropriate agencies such as the UC, TSPG or STAO  (for  space  systems)  and  product  or  materiel  group,  shall  establish  training  system  validation requirements.  The SIMVAL program ensures the quality of the intended level of training is delivered and  maintained.    The  V&V  reports  generated  by  the  SIMVAL  program  support  the  accreditation authority’s decision to accredit the associated training system for its intended use. 6.3.1.  The validation shall include: 6.3.1.1.  A comparison between the current intelligence threat assessments of a weapons system to  the  training  system’s  simulated  mission  environment  (i.e.,  threat  models,  weapon  flyout models, etc.). 6.3.1.2.    An  assessment  of  the  interaction  between  the  weapon  system  and  the  operational environment. 6.3.1.3.  A documented summary of the differences between the training system and the weapon system. 6.3.1.4.  The STP/LCMP/HSI should include an overview of validation requirements. 6.3.1.5.    Conduct  the  LC  SIMVAL  program  IAW  MAJCOM  supplements  to  this  AFI  or  in accordance with AFI 16-1001, Verification, Validation, and Accreditation (VV&A).  Accomplish SIMVAL throughout the life cycle of the training system. 6.4.  Adopted Forms.

DMO  focuses  on  individual  and  small  team  unit-level  training,  utilizing  a  unit’s  organic resources to train assigned warfighters to perform their wartime tasks.  It also expands a unit’s training capabilities  and  resources  to  facilitate  Inter-team  training  among  geographically  separated  and composite  force  teams  to  execute  missions  (or  significant  portions  of  missions)  and  mission  rehearsal scenarios. that  utilizes training the Human  Systems  Integration  (HSI)—-The  process  of  effective  integration  of  manpower,  personnel, training,  human  factors,  safety  and  occupational  health,  personnal  survivability,  and  habitability considerations into the acquisition of prime  mission systems to  improve total system performance and reduce costs by focusing attention on the capabilities and limitations of humans. Interactive  Courseware  (ICW)—-A  computer  program  controlled  instruction  that  relies  on  trainee input to determine the order and pace of instruction delivery. Instructional  System  Development  (ISD)—-A  deliberate  and  orderly  process  for  planning  and developing  instructional  programs  that  make  sure  personnel  are  taught  the  knowledge,  skills,  and attitudes  essential  for  successful  job  performance.    Depends  on  a  description  and  analysis  of  the  tasks necessary for performing the job, objectives, and tests clearly stated before instruction begins, evaluation procedures to determine whether or not the objectives have been reached, and methods for revising the process based on empirical data. (See AFMAN 36-2234) Lead Command (LC)—-The MAJCOM, which is the primary operator of a system, subsystem, or item of  equipment.    This  generally  applies  to  those  operational  Commands  or  organizations  designated  by Headquarters US Air Force to conduct or participate in operations or operational testing (See AFPD 10-9).  The Air Force assigns responsibility for overall management of each prime mission system to a LC. The  LC  contributes  to  the  process  of  developing  and  maintaining  a  force  structure  with  a  balance  of complementary capabilities, and it establishes a basis for rational allocation of scarce resources among competing  requirements.    In  other  words,  the  LC  is  responsible  for  advocating,  programming  and allocating funding for those systems assigned to it. 20 AFI36-2251  3 JUNE 2009 Master  Training  Task  List  (MTTL)—-Documentation  of  total  training  tasks  developed  for  a  prime mission  system  and  its  respective  mission.    It  includes  the  entire  spectrum  of  tasks  in  each  functional area  (operations,  maintenance,  and  support)  requiring  training.

(MECs)—--Higher-order inter-team Mission  Essential  Competencies competencies that a fully prepared pilot, crew, or flight requires for successful mission completion under adverse conditions and in a non-permissive environment.  MECs are derived from descriptions of how aircrews  accomplish  the  kill  chain  (Find,  Fix,  Track,  target,  Engage,  Assess)  within  their  MDS  and mission.  They have distinct starting and end points, and if not successfully completed before going into the  next  phase,  can  jeopardize  successful  mission  completion.    MECS  are  not  abstract  knowledge  or general  skills.    They  are  demonstrated  in  the  context  of  an  actual  mission  or  high-fidelity  simulated mission, under wartime conditions. individual, team,  and Mission/Task Analysis (MTA)—--A process of reviewing mission requirements, developing collective task statements, and arranging the collective tasks in a hierarchical relationship. Mission  Trainer—--A  device  that  provides  the  trainees  with  a  simulated  warfare  environment  that  is specifically  mission  oriented  to  the  type  of  prime  mission  system  involved.    The  device  can  provide specific prime mission system operator modes or a mission mode that requires tactical decision-making. Prime Mission System (Equipment)—-Any weapon system, support system, work station, or end-item that  supports  a  specific  military  mission,  therefore  requiring  operations,  maintenance,  or  support personnel training.

The PM has life-cycle responsibility for the prime mission system.  PM duties include  providing  assessments  of  program  status  and  risk  to  higher  authorities  and  to  the  operator  or operator's representative; actively managing within approved resources, program cost, performance, and schedule;  and  providing  assessments  of  contractor  performance.    As  used  in  this  instruction  applies collectively to System Program Manager and/or Product Group Manager. Simulation—--A method for implementing a model over time.  Also a technique for testing, analysis, or training in which real-world systems are used, or where real-world and conceptual systems are prepared by a model. Simulator—--A  training  device  that  permits  development  and  practice  of  the  necessary  skills  for accomplishing  operational  tasks,  to  a  prescribed  standard  of  competency,  in  a  specific  prime  mission system and duty position. Simulator  Certification  (SIMCERT)—--The process of ensuring through validation of hardware and software  baselines  that  a  Training  System  and  its  components  provide  accurate  and  credible  training.  The  process  also  makes  sure  the  device  continues  to  perform  to  the  delivered  specifications, AFI36-2251  3 JUNE 2009 21 performance criteria, and configuration  levels.  It will also set up an audit trail regarding specification and baseline data for compliance and subsequent contract solicitation or device modification. Simulator  Validation  (SIMVAL)—-The  process  for  (1)  comparing  a  training  device’s  operating parameters  and  performance  to  the  current  intelligence  assessment  of  a  weapon  system,  threat  and interaction  between  the  weapon  system  and  threat  and  (2)  documenting  the  differences  and  impacts. This  process  includes  generation  and  deployment  of  an  intelligence  data  baseline  of  the  system, comparison  of  simulator  characteristics  and  performance,  support  for  the  modification  and  upgrade  of the  simulator,  a  comparison  of  simulator  and  threat  operating  procedures,  and  correction  of  any significant deficiencies.  Uncorrected deficiencies are identified and published in validation reports.  The process continues throughout the life cycle of the simulator. System Training Plan (STP)—The STP is an iterative planning document that defines the justification, design,  development,  funding,  resources,  support,  modification,  operation,  and  management  of  a Training  System.   The  STP is  designed to  provide for planning  and implementation  of  training and to make  sure  all  resources  and  supporting  actions  required  for  establishment  and  support  are  considered.  The  STP  may  be  a  stand-alone  document,  or  it  may  be  referenced and  summarized  in    the  Life  Cycle Management Plan (LCMP) or Human Systems Integration (HSI) documents.  All references to the STP in this document incorporate the possibility that the intended documentation may be part of an LCMP or HSI documents. Technical  Planning  Integrated  Product  Team  (TPIPT)—-TPIPTs  are  multi-constituent  teams  of Operators  and  AFMC  laboratories,  System  Program  Offices,  development  planners,  and  industry  to generate,  consolidate,  and  analyze  an  array  of  concept  options  and  technology  needs  that  address  the Operator's needs.

Training  Systems  Requirements  Analysis  (TSRA)—-The  initial  step  in  user  requirements identification.  It consists of mission/task analysis, training requirements identification, objectives/media analysis,  and  training  systems  basis  analysis.    A  TSRA  integrates  the  products  of  the  Instructional System Development (ISD) process and the Systems Engineering (SE) process to describe the Training System to be procured.  It serves as a required input to the System Training Plan.  It is accomplished by the PM in coordination with the LC and UC. Using  Command  (UC)—--Any  Command  or  organization  that  possess  a  prime  weapon  system  and uses  the  products  of  the  Training  System.    The  Using  Command  is  responsible  for  managing  and conducting  mission  operations  using  the  resources  allocated  by  the  Lead  Command  and  Higher Headquarters.  As such, the UC is responsible for defining the system requirements necessary to conduct and  sustain  operations.

Training  System  Requirements  Analysis  (TSRA)  Process.    For  new  and  emerging  weapon systems,  a  Training  System  Requirements  Analysis  shall  be  conducted  to  fully  define  the  training system requirements and to identify any risks to develop and implement the training system. For existing weapon systems, TSRAs will be conducted when major modifications to existing training capability are anticipated  or  when  the  training  system  PM,  or  TPT  determines  the  need  for  a  TSRA.  This  analysis enables the UC experts to prioritize critical tasks and ensure all training requirements are addressed in the Instructional Systems Development (ISD) process. The LC, in conjunction with Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC)/Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) program office, product or materiel group, or AETC  in  coordination  with  LC/UC,  should  perform  the  TSRA.  The  TSRA  contains  four  major components:  mission/task  analysis  (MTA),  training  requirements  analysis  (TRA),  objectives/media analysis (OMA), and the Training System Basis Analysis (TSBA). A3.1.1.    Mission/Task  Analysis  (MTA).    The  MTA  identifies  and  analyzes  all  tasks  to  be performed for the operation and maintenance of the prime mission system. The MTA will result in the  training  task  list  for  each  mission  area.  The  TSM,  together  with  appropriate  agencies,  will develop  and  the  TPT  will  maintain  a  Master  Training  Task  List (MTTL)  by  mission  area  for each prime mission system. The MTA is the parent document for the MTTL. Thus, the MTTL should be derived  from  analysis  of  mission  tasks,  associated  system  tasks,  legacy  mission  equipment  or Training  System  task  lists,  and  additional  requirements  resulting  from  personnel  and  resource availability,  security,  cost,  and  environment,  safety,  and  occupational  health  (ESOH)  constraints imposed  by  the  peacetime  environment.  The  TPT  will  determine  the  configuration  of  the  MTTL. The MTTL should: A3.1.1.1.  Provide a total listing of tasks to be trained from initial entry into the prime mission equipment through upgrade, qualification, and continuation training. A3.1.1.2.    Break  each  mission  into  tasks  to  be  trained,  situational  context,  and  coordination requirements. Each prime equipment mission shall be described in terms of mission objectives, scenarios, and mission profiles. A3.1.1.3.  Provide a full range of threat and environmental conditions. A3.1.1.4.  Provide a detailed task analysis record that characterizes each task and the criteria for successful performance in a mission context. A3.1.2.  Training Requirements Analysis (TRA).  The TRA converts the MTTL into the training requirements  for  the  prime  mission  system.  The  TRA  defines  the  entry  level  and  exit  level  Skills, Knowledge, and Attitudes (SKA) for each unique target student population.  The target population can include 3, 5, and 7-level personnel, whether in upgrade, qualification or continuation training. A3.1.2.1.  Training requirements equal SKAExit minus SKAEntry A3.1.2.2.  Entry SKAs are baselined to the target student population (e.g. basic training graduate, cross-trainee). A3.1.2.3.  Exit SKAs are derived from the Job Performance Requirements (JPRs) provided in the MTA. A3.1.2.4.  SKAs are classified as perceptual, motor, cognitive, and information processing skills, knowledge requirements, and desired attitudes. 30 AFI36-2251  3 JUNE 2009 A3.1.3.    Objectives/Media  Analysis  (OMA).    The  OMA  identifies  all  training  objectives.    It  also allocates  and  justifies  instructional  strategies,  methods,  and  media  for  each  training  objective.  The OMA: A3.1.3.1.  Defines training objectives in terms of conditions, required behavior, and standards of acceptable performance. A3.1.3.2.  Defines a media analysis and selection process. A3.1.3.3.  Documents the method/media trade process. A3.1.3.4.    Selects  the  method/media  to  be  used  and,  with  rationale,  allocates  the  training objectives. A3.1.3.5.  Develops the syllabus and course map. A3.1.4.  Training Systems Basis Analysis (TSBA).  The final step in the TSRA is the TSBA.  The TSBA: A3.1.4.1.    Analyzes  the  existing  Training  System,  identifies  training  deficiencies,  and recommends solutions. A3.1.4.2.  Assesses technology for potential application of new training technology to Training System concepts. A3.1.4.3.  Evaluates alternative Training System concepts and system configurations. A3.1.4.4.    Recommends  numbers,  functions,  and  types  of  training  media,  courseware requirements, and training management system functions. A3.1.4.5.    Provides  rationale  and  justification  concerning  how  a  proposed  system  will  remedy deficiencies. A3.1.4.6.    (Optional)  Develops  a  preliminary  system  requirements  document  that  consolidates training and system requirements. A3.2.    TSRA  Support  of  the  STP.  For emerging systems and updates to fielded systems, the TSRA provides inputs and supporting rationale for the STP.  The TSRA shall be completed in the Technology Development  phase  with  sufficient  lead  time  to  complete  the  STP,  which  is  required  at  Milestone B/KDP B.  The STP shall: A3.2.1.    Identify  tasks  for  which  personnel  cannot  be  currently  adequately  trained.  These  tasks should  be  documented  in  the  STP  as  unmet  requirements.  If  necessary,  they  will  be  identified  as potential limiting factors in the ability to accomplish the prime equipment mission. A3.2.2.  Include an ISD analysis of the ground-based media. Analyze how it complements hands-on training  or  supplements  training  when  resource  availability,  security,  cost,  and  ESOH  constraints limit use of the prime mission equipment as a training media. A3.2.3.  Identify alternatives based on validated opportunities to train, qualify, and certify personnel. A3.2.4.    Identify  how  subsystems  and  components  should  be  integrated  into  the  total  Training System. A3.2.5.    Recommend  areas  for  new  technology  applications  to  improve  future  Training  System effectiveness and efficiency.  AFI36-2251  3 JUNE 2009 31 Attachment 4 TRAINING SYSTEM METRICS A4.1.      The  following  table  and example remarks are provided as  tools to  help track aircrew training system utilization and to communicate the status and health of training systems through the MAJCOMs to HQ USAF/A3O-AT.  The intent is to gain and maintain visibility on issues affecting aircrew training systems and measure and improve on how simulator training is conducted.  MAJCOMs can modify this table  as  necessary  or  use  other  existing  forms,  such  as  the  AF  IMT  4026,  Aircrew  Training  Devices Utilization,  to  track  training  system  metrics.    As  stated  in  paragraph  3.1.1.9  and  3.1.2.2,  simulator utilization and concurrency impacts will be reported to HQ USAF/A3O-AT semi-annually. Table A4.1.  Aircrew Training System Metrics.
