Training Folder Documentation. See Chapter 7 and Attachment 2. 1.10.  Evaluator Usage. Use flight evaluators for any phase of training to capitalize on their expertise andexperience. Units may use flight evaluators as instructors for qualification and upgrade training.  If anevaluator is used as a primary instructor to train an individual or makes the recommendation for evalua-tion, the same evaluator should not administer the associated evaluation. 1.11.  Instructor Training and Supervision Requirements.  1.11.1.  All instructors should be MR (wing-level and below). 1.11.2.  When performing aircrew duties, the following personnel must be under the direct supervisionof an instructor: 1.11.2.1.  All non-current aircrew members (see para 4.2.5.2. for exceptions). 1.11.2.2.  All aircrew members in initial, upgrade (to include special mission qualification train-ing) or requalification flying training.  Upgrade students may fly without an instructor when per-forming duties not related to the upgrade, unless otherwise restricted in this paragraph. 1.11.2.3.  Any other personnel designated by the wing, operations group, or squadron command-ers. 1.11.3.  For unqualified, non-current, and FTL E (see para 4.3.1. for definition) aircrew members, aninstructor will be at a set of controls (or primary duty station) during critical phases of flight. 1.12.  Distribution. Units will establish hard copy distribution requirements of this AFI. AFI11-2C-38V1   20 APRIL 2006111.13.  Transfer of Aircrews. Before an aircrew member transfers from one unit to another, the gainingunit will review, assess and assign the appropriate TL. 1.14.  Aircrew Training—DNIF and Alert.  1.14.1.  Aircrew members whose status is “duty not involving flying (DNIF)” may log ground trainingevents, including simulator training, if the member’s physical condition allows it.  Consult the flightsurgeon initiating AF IMT 1042, Medical Recommendation for Flying or Special Operational Duty,and action if the DNIF status includes ground training limitations. 1.14.2.  Aircrew members performing alert duty (of any duration) may accomplish ground trainingthat does not degrade required response time or mission accomplishment.  Specify requirements and/or restrictions in MAJCOM supplement. 1.15.  Information Management. HQ AMC Aircrew Training Division (A37T) manages a host of air-crew information.  The site address, https://private.amc.af.mil/A3/A37T/dot/dot.cfm, includes down-load information for command-level training courses (e.g., TCAS).  HQ ANG Operations TrainingDivision’s Mobility Air Forces Flying Training Branch (NGB/A3TM) hosts aircrew training informationat its website, https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?Filter=OO-OP-AN-G6. 1.16.  Failure to Progress. If a student fails to progress according to syllabus requirements, then conducta Progress Review Board (PRB).  The PRB can recommend: continuation in training; or AFI 11-402, Avi-ation and Parachutist Service, Aeronautical Ratings and Badges, action; (e.g., a Flying Evaluation Board(FEB) convened by the member’s wing commander).  The ATS contractor will identify students who failto progress IAW the applicable ATS contract as outlined in Chapter 6. 1.17.  Failure to Complete Training. If an aircrew member fails to complete a formal course, then theformal school will send a recommendation to the individual’s unit.  The recommendation will statewhether he or she should complete training in-unit, or return to the formal school to complete training, orbe referred to the AF personnel system for reassignment. 1.18.  Mobility Pilot Designation (MPD) Codes. AFI 11-401 defines pilot aviation codes.  For standard-ization, use the following: 1.18.1.  FP = “Qualified Pilot.”  This designation (as a 2-digit code) will remain active during theMPD transition period for first pilots.  (Note: FP will be phased out after the transition to MPD is com-plete). 1.18.2.  During the projected 3-year transition to replace copilot and aircraft commander trainingcourses with MPD training, copilots will continue to upgrade to aircraft commander.  MPD pilotsshould have a shorter time to upgrade to aircraft commander; training will be conducted locally. 1.18.2.1.  FPN – Qualified Pilot – Non-MR (MPD graduate in local MR training) 1.18.2.2.  FPQ – Qualified “MR” MPD pilot 1.18.2.3.  FPL – Qualified “MR” Direct left seat, cross-flow, OSA, or FAIP graduate 1.18.2.4.  FPR – Ready for AC certification (training complete) 1.18.2.5.  MP – Fully certified/qualified aircraft commander 12AFI11-2C-38V1   20 APRIL 20061.18.2.6.  MPN – Aircraft Commander – non-MR 1.18.3.  Application. 1.18.3.1.  MPD applies to pilots who have never been an aircraft commander only.  Upon comple-tion of MPD pilot initial qualification (PIQ) training, newly assigned C-38-A pilots will be desig-nated as FP in ARMS.  They will then progress through a series of standardized third characterqualification codes (exact progression will depend upon prior experience and prerequisites). 1.18.3.2.  FP = Qualified Pilot (third letter designator distinguishes the status of a MPD pilot whocompleted formal training with evaluation (graduate). 1.18.3.3.  FPN = MPD pilot (graduate) currently in local MR training (NMR).  See level of super-vision mission capabilities. 1.18.3.4.  FPQ = Qualified “MR” MPD pilot – can fly on any mission with an AC or IP. 1.18.3.5.  FPL = Qualified, direct left seat cross-flow pilot, OSA, FAIP graduate, before complet-ing MCT training. 1.18.3.6.  MP = Certified aircraft commander. 1.18.3.7.  MPN = Certified aircraft commander (non-MR) NOTE: The third digit “N” (e.g., MPN) signifies the MP will be NMR for an extended period of time(greater than a month).  Do not use the third digit “N” for short duration (one month or less) NMR status,such as those due to DNIF or currency deficiencies. AFI11-2C-38V1   20 APRIL 200613Chapter 2   INITIAL QUALIFICATION TRAINING 2.1.  Description. AFI 11-202, Volume 1 defines initial qualification training.  This chapter specifies min-imum training requirements for initial qualification, requalification, conversion/difference qualification,and senior officer courses.  Initial qualification is accomplished by completion of C-38 (G100) contrac-tor-developed formal simulator training course at Flight Safety Services Corporation. 2.2.  Initial Qualification Training Prerequisites. Complete initial qualification prerequisites IAW AFI11-202, Volume 1 and this instruction. 2.2.1.  Initial qualification.  On completion of initial qualification training, aircrew members will beclassified as basic aircraft qualified (BAQ).  Aircrew members must then comply with mission quali-fication (Chapter 3) and continuation training (Chapter 4) requirements. 2.2.2.  In-unit training in lieu of formal school.   When attendance at a formal school is not practical orquotas are not available, units will request waivers to conduct in-unit qualification training using for-mal school courseware.  In-unit training should begin no later than 90 days after reporting or beingattached to the 201 AS.  NGB/A3T is the waiver authority. 2.3.  Ground Training Requirements.

Conversion/Difference Qualification Training Requirements.  14AFI11-2C-38V1   20 APRIL 20062.5.1.  Difference qualification is normally conducted when training in a different series aircraft in thesame MDS.  However, when the differences between series are great enough, the training is consid-ered conversion training which requires completion of the formal school initial qualification course.If the new aircraft has the same mission as the current aircraft, there is no requirement for additionalmission qualification training. 2.5.1.1.  Difference Training.  Aircrew members will meet all initial qualification requirements inone aircraft prior to entering differences training in another model aircraft. Send recommendationsthrough ANG channels to NGB/A3T when additional difference training requirements are identi-fied.  Difference training will be documented using over-printed AF Form 4024, Training Accom-plishment Report, listing difference training requirements. 2.5.1.2.  Conversion Training.  Conversion applies to units converting to another MDS.  Whenpossible, qualified personnel from other sources will provide the initial cadre.  Depending on theMDS, it could be necessary for the 201 AS to form an initial cadre from squadron aircrew mem-bers for whom certain training qualification requirements may be waived.  Converting units mayrequest initial cadre waiver of primary aircraft assigned (PAA) time requirement.  Additionally,include the most recent aircraft flown and total time in that aircraft in the remarks’ section of thewaiver.  The following conditions will apply to management of initial cadre aircrew qualification: 2.5.1.2.1.  Form a nucleus of instructor and flight-examiner personnel to begin aircrew conver-sion using qualified personnel from other units if possible. 2.5.1.2.2.  Initial cadre will not be designated in a crew position higher than currently held(e.g., C-40 MP to C-38 EP) unless previously qualified in the conversion aircraft. 2.5.1.2.3.  After final approval, publish a unit letter to identify initial cadre of instructors andflight examiners by crew qualification. 2.5.2.  Prior Qualification.  Prior-qualified aircrew members may be accelerated through the normaltraining program. 2.6.  Multiple Qualifications. MAJCOMs may authorize qualification in more than one MDS aircraft foraircrew members only when such action is directed by command mission requirements and is economi-cally justifiable.  201 AS/CC will designate which aircrew members will maintain qualification in morethan one aircraft only after approval by NGB/A3.  When manning necessitates, 201 AS full-time pilotsmay be qualified in more than one aircraft only after approval by NGB/A3.  These pilots must be missionqualified with at least 100 hours in command and have at least 1,250 hours of primary and secondary timein military fixed wing aircraft.  Aircrew members must be approved and re-certified for multiple qualifi-cations annually by NGB/A3.  Aircrew members maintaining dual qualification in different model aircraftwill, as a minimum, maintain FTL A currency requirements in each aircraft for pilots (N/A for seniorofficers; see para 2.7.). 2.7.  Senior Officer Qualification and Performance Requirements. AFI 11-202, Volume 1 para 2.8.identifies senior officer qualification requirements.  These officers will be assigned FTL E for continua-tion training purposes and will not fly unsupervised in a primary crew position (see para 4.3.1.5.., andpara 4.3.2.4.). 2.7.1.  After qualification IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 1, and with OG/CC approval, senior officers(assigned or attached) may seek training which leads to a higher FTL and/or qualification.  201 AS/AFI11-2C-38V1   20 APRIL 200615DOT is responsible for determining training requirements based on the senior officer’s flying experi-ence and familiarity with the weapons system.  NGB/A3T will approve the proposed training planprior to execution. 2.8.  Flight Surgeons. AFI 11-202, Volume 1 establishes flight surgeon initial qualification requirements.Flight surgeons will complete a standardized online open book examination.  Flight surgeons will accom-plish ground egress training for each aircraft on which they fly.  They must also be current in physiologi-cal training and have a current flight physical.  Flight surgeons will comply with Table 2.1. and Table 3.1.(“FS” column) in this instruction.  Flight surgeons are authorized multiple qualifications. 2.9.  Reports. The ATS has a post-training feedback system that elicits information and comments fromstudents, supervisors, and examiners in order to continually improve, update, and refine the ATS.  Com-manders and supervisors will promote use of this feedback system to its fullest extent. 16AFI11-2C-38V1   20 APRIL 2006Chapter 3   MISSION QUALIFICATION AND CERTIFICATION TRAINING 3.1.  Description. This chapter establishes minimum criteria and training requirements for mission quali-fication training.  Except where specifically stated, squadrons may arrange mission sequence or sequenceof items as necessary to use flying training hours effectively and accomplish the unit mission. Both pilotsmust be qualified when passengers are on board according to AFI 11-401.  Mission qualification trainingmay be accomplished with passengers on board the aircraft provided each aircrew member is current in allbasic mission capable (BMC) events listed in Table 4.1.  In order to accomplish training on overseas mis-sions, aircrew members must be current in all MR items listed in Table 4.1. 3.2.  Mission Qualification Training Requirements. Complete all mission qualification requirementsIAW AFI 11-202, Volume 1, Table 3.1..  All ground training requirements and flying training require-ments must be accomplished prior to unit mission certification. 3.2.1.  MR (MR) requirements must be completed prior to being deemed MR.  Local training or oper-ational missions may be flown before completing all MR items, provided the qualified aircrew mem-ber has a current flight physical, and has completed physiological, initial ground egress, marshaling(pilots only), and life support training. 3.3.  Ground Training Requirements. All aircrew members will accomplish all events in Table 3.1.(Exception: senior officers or staff officers maintaining BAQ).  Ensure ground training requirements inTable 2.1. have also been accomplished. Table 3.1.  Mission Qualification Ground Training Requirements.

Complete if not accomplished during initial qualification. 3. G090 and G110 are requirements for flight surgeon initial qualification training. 3.4.  Flying Training Requirements.  3.4.1.  Basic aircraft qualified (BAQ) aircrew members pursuing MR status will accomplish FlightTraining Level (FTL) D (see para 4.3.) continuation training requirements.  Upon completion of mis-sion qualification training, the aircrew member’s training level (TL) will be immediately changed toFTL C and flying training requirements prorated from the date of mission qualification status. 3.4.2.  MR Certification.  Pilots must complete at least one operational mission with an instructor priorto being certified as MR. 3.4.3.  Category II Aircrew Training.  If not accomplished during initial qualification training andannotated on AF IMT 8, Cat II training and certification will be accomplished during Mission Quali-fication Training (MQT). 3.5.  Theater Indoctrination (TI). Theater indoctrination (M060) will be conducted according to AFI11-202, Volume 1 and this instruction.  At a minimum, training should include a thorough review of the-ater unique instrument requirements and procedures, use of non-DoD instrument approach procedures,required instrumentation for specific approaches, theater weather conditions, local area procedures, andhost nation agreements.  Unit commanders are responsible for the accomplishment of this training for allassigned and attached aircrew members and will design a program to meet requirements unique to unitoperations.  Completion of TI training does not require attainment of MR status. 3.6.  Category II ILS Training.  This section outlines the training program for C-38 pilots who are com-mand-certified for category II ILS operations. 3.6.1.  Seat occupancy during category II ILS approach and landing training.  A qualified category IIILS instructor or flight examiner pilot will occupy the appropriate seat, as applicable, during pilot cat-egory II ILS training. 3.6.2.  Training weather and runway requirements. 3.6.2.1.  Actual weather – no lower than a 200 foot ceiling and ½ mile visibility (runway visualrange of 24) or 800 meters day and night. 3.6.2.2.  Crosswind component – 15 knots maximum. 3.6.2.3.  Runway length – at least computed landing distance (brakes and speed brakes) plus 2,000feet. 3.6.3.  Normally, the following ground and flight training requirements will be incorporated into theinitial aircraft qualification course: 3.6.3.1.  Ground Training.  The training program must provide pilots training in the following sub-jects: 3.6.3.1.1.  Operational characteristics, capabilities, and limitations of category II/III ILS andvisual aids (e.g., approach lights, in-runway lights, transmissometers). 18AFI11-2C-38V1   20 APRIL 20063.6.3.1.2.  Using runway environment visual cues during category II weather conditions withrespect to different glide slope angles, cockpit cutoff angles, and altitudes at which these visualcues are normally discernible. 3.6.3.1.3.  Operational characteristics, capabilities, and limitations of category II ILS airbornesystems (e.g., flight director system; automatic approach coupler; system used to identify thedecision height for category II approaches, instrumentation, and other systems and devicespeculiar to the aircraft. 3.6.3.1.4.  Resolution of decision height or missed approach point or minimum descent alti-tude with component failures (ground or aircraft). 3.6.3.2.  Flight Training.  Flight or simulator training will cover the following subjects: 3.6.3.2.1.  Resolution of decision height. 3.6.3.2.2.  Missed approach procedures. 3.6.3.2.3.  Runway visual range, uses, and limitations. 3.6.3.2.4.  Transition from instrument to visual flight cues. 3.6.3.2.5.  Effects of vertical and horizontal wind shear. 3.6.3.2.6.  Review of category II specifications. 3.6.3.2.7.  Practice at least one approach in each authorized equipment mode. 3.7.  Category II ILS Training Certification.  This applies to C-38 pilots in aircraft that are command-cer-tified for category II ILS operations. 3.7.1.  Eligibility.  Pilots should be administered initial category II ILS training and evaluation duringtheir initial qualification training.  If not accomplished at that time, category II ILS training will beaccomplished during MQT. 3.7.2.  Scheduling.  Two otherwise qualified pilots may receive category II ILS training and certifica-tion on the same flight while occupying seats together and supervised by an instructor or evaluator.When a single pilot is receiving training and certification, a qualified category II ILS pilot will occupythe opposite seat. AFI11-2C-38V1   20 APRIL 200619Chapter 4   CONTINUATION TRAINING 4.1.  Description. This chapter establishes the minimum flying and related ground training requirementsto maintain currency.  The unit commander will ensure aircrew members receive sufficient continuationtraining to maintain individual proficiency. 4.2.  Aircrew Status. Aircrew members are assigned to MR (MR), Basic Mission Capable (BMC), BasicAircraft Qualification (BAQ), or Non-MR (NMR) status. 4.2.1.  MR (MR).  A MR aircrew member is defined as one who is current, qualified and, if required,certified in the squadron’s mission; that is, the aircrew members has completed mission qualificationtraining (MQT) for the applicable crew position.  All aircrew members, except senior officers, will beMR.  An aircrew member that has failed to maintain currency in all events required for MR statusreverts to BMC status.  The aircrew member may not fly OCONUS until regaining currency in thoseevents. 4.2.2.  Basic Mission Capable (BMC).  A non-MR aircrew member assigned to MAJCOM headquar-ters, NAF, TACC, AMWC, tanker airlift control element (TALCE), AMOG, formal schoolhouse, ordirect reporting unit who has satisfactorily completed mission qualification training and does notmaintain MR status, but maintains familiarization in the command or unit operational mission.  Theaircrew member may maintain qualification in some aspects of the unit mission and is able to attainfull qualification in the unit mission within 45 days.  BMC aircrew members may log instructor orevaluator time for the portion of the mission for which they are current and qualified.  An aircrewmember that has failed to maintain currency in events required for BMC status reverts to BAQ status.The aircrew member is not allowed to fly operational missions until regaining currency in thoseevents. 4.2.3.  Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ).  An aircrew member that has satisfactorily completedtraining and is qualified to perform aircrew duties in the unit aircraft.  See AFI 11-202, Volume 1.  Anaircrew member that has failed to maintain currency in events required for BAQ status reverts to FLYstatus.  The aircrew member must fly with an instructor on all sorties until regaining currency in thoseevents.  Pilots will fly without passengers onboard until regaining currency in those events. 4.2.4.  Loss of FLY Status.  An aircrew member that has failed to maintain currency in events requiredfor FLY status will not fly until the overdue events are accomplished. 4.2.5.  Non-MR (NMR).  An individual who is non-current or unqualified in the aircraft, incompletein required ground and/or flight continuation training, or not certified to perform the unit mission is aNMR crewmember.  See paras 4.7. and 4.8. 4.2.5.1.  If an aircrew member is NMR for failure to complete required continuation training, OG/CC has two options: 4.2.5.1.1.  Waive the required training IAW para 4.8.  The individual is then designated as anMR aircrew member.  This should be accomplished at the earliest opportunity. 4.2.5.1.2.  Place the aircrew member in supervised status IAW para 4.2.5.2. 20AFI11-2C-38V1   20 APRIL 20064.2.5.2.  If the aircrew member is NMR for failure to maintain currency per para 4.8., place theaircrew member in supervised status for that event (and the aircrew member flies with an instruc-tor of like specialty) until required training is accomplished. 4.3.  Training Levels (TL). SQ/CC or designated representative determines the TL prior to each semian-nual period.  Assign new aircrew members a TL during in-processing.  Base TL on experience and profi-ciency.  Aircrew members may be assigned TL levels that are more restrictive, but never less restrictive,than the requirements specified in this paragraph.  TL definitions follow: 4.3.1.  Flying Training Levels (FTL). 4.3.1.1.  FTL A – Highly Experienced Crewmembers.  This may include wing, operations group,and unit commanders, operations officers, personnel assigned to OG evaluation positions, and anyinstructors assigned primarily to staff duties.  Unit commanders may assign highly experiencedMR line aircrew members to this level.  Individuals may or may not maintain MR status. 4.3.1.2.  FTL B – Experienced, MR aircrew members. 4.3.1.3.  FTL C – MR aircrew members.  Inexperienced aircrew members should be designatedFTL C. 4.3.1.4.  FTL D – BAQ aircrew members.  Primarily designated for BAQ aircrew members whoare pursuing MR status. 4.3.1.5.  FTL E – BAQ, Non-Instructor Staff (may include senior officers, MAJCOM, NAF, andTACC individuals who are not maintaining MR or instructor status).  FTL E requirements are suf-ficient for BAQ and BMC status but are insufficient for MR status.  Aircrew members assigned toFTL E will fly with an instructor of like specialty at all times. 4.3.2.  Ground Training Levels (GTL). 4.3.2.1.  GTL 1 – Highly experienced aircrew members with 10 or more years of operational fly-ing in their rated specialty. 4.3.2.2.  GTL 2 – Experienced aircrew members with between 5 and 10 years of operational fly-ing. 4.3.2.3.  GTL 3 – Inexperienced aircrew members with less than 5 years of operational flying. 4.3.2.4.  GTL 4 – NMR senior officers and staff officers. 4.4.  Training Requirements/Tables. Standardized ARMS training requirement identifiers and descrip-tions are in Chapter 7.  Unit-defined requirements are designated as “X” events (e.g., X020) and arelisted in applicable MAJCOM supplements. 4.4.1.  Crediting Event Accomplishment. 4.4.1.1.  In addition to events accomplished on training and operational missions, those flightevents accomplished on a satisfactory initial qualification, mission qualification, specialized mis-sion qualification, or requalification evaluation may be credited towards the individual’s currencyrequirements to establish subsequent due dates and semiannual flying event requirements. 4.4.1.2.  Aircrew members who are unqualified in the aircraft due to an unsatisfactory flight eval-uation will not log continuation training requirements for those events graded unqualified (Q-3)AFI11-2C-38V1   20 APRIL 200621according to AFI 11-2SAM Volume 2, Aircrew Evaluation Criteria (will be AFI          11-2C-38Volume 2, Aircrew Evaluation Criteria), until requalified. 4.4.1.3.  Make-up training (ground or flying) is creditable towards the new training period. 4.4.1.4.  Instructor Training Requirements and Responsibilities.  Instructors and examiners maycredit 50 percent of their total requirements while instructing or evaluating.  EXCEPTION:Instructor and flight examiner pilots may not credit any takeoffs or landings flown by anotherpilot. 4.4.2.  Simulator Credit for Training Events.  Pilots may log continuation flying events accomplishedin the simulator (FAA-certified Level C or better) unless otherwise specified by the respective eventdescription in Chapter 7, MAJCOM supplement, or Table 4.2.  Pilots may maintain or regain cur-rency events accomplished in the simulator. 4.4.2.1.  Simulator Refresher Course Requirements.  All assigned and attached pilots will com-plete annual simulator training during the calendar year.  Simulator training is provided by FlightSafety Services Corporation. 4.4.2.2.  NGB/A3T is the only agency authorized to submit course requirement changes to thecontractor. 4.4.2.3.  The unit training office will be the central point of contact between all agencies and thecontractor for scheduling simulator refresher training.  201 AS/DOT will forward simulatorrequirements for the next fiscal year (FY) to HQ NGB/A3T no later than 15 July annually.Requests must identify both the optimum (minimum) and maximum number of classes desired. 4.4.3.  Use the appropriate ARMS forms specified in AFI 11-202, Volume 1 to record all accom-plished training and to update the ARMS database.  The HARM will provide event numbers to iden-tify each training requirement and establish local procedures to ensure timely data input to ARMS. 4.4.4.  Centralized aircrew training record.  All training events will be recorded in the ARMS data-base. 4.4.4.1.  Combined training events may have only one ARMS entry.  Separate training events maybe logged when the appropriate course material is intentionally covered in one training session.All one-time and PCS-in events will be entered into the ARMS database.  These events need notbe maintained on individual currency reports. 4.5.  Ground Continuation Training Requirements.  4.5.1.  Aircrew members (including flight surgeons) will comply with the requirements of Table 4.1.See Chapter 7 for event descriptions. 4.5.1.1.  Failure to accomplish requirements in Table 4.1. leads to NMR status.  See para 4.8. forregaining MR status. 4.5.1.2.  Failure to complete mobility training requirements in Table 4.1. does not lead to NMRstatus but may restrict aircrew member from certain missions. 4.5.1.3.  MR requirements must be completed prior to participating in operational missions as aqualified aircrew member.  Local training missions may be flown before completing all MR items,provided the member has a current flight physical, and has completed physiological, initial ground22AFI11-2C-38V1   20 APRIL 2006egress, marshalling, and life support training.  MR, BMC, and BAQ aircrew members will accom-plish and/or maintain the requirements in AFI 11-202, Volume 1 (for their respective status) andthe appropriate events in ground and semi-annual flying continuation tables. 4.5.2.  Attached aircrew members may accomplish ground training events at locations other than theirunits of attachment.  The event must meet training standards and receive NGB/A3T approval.  Mem-bers are responsible for reporting accomplished training to the unit HARM. 4.5.3.  Continuation Training.  The following will be emphasized in continuation training courses: 4.5.3.1.  Crew resource management (CRM). 4.5.3.2.  Systems knowledge and operating procedures. 4.5.3.3.  Normal, emergency, and instrument flight procedures. 4.5.3.4.  Operational risk management (ORM). 4.5.3.5.  Mission-Oriented Simulator Training (MOST). 4.5.4.  Senior Officers who complete the Senior Officer Qualification Course (A004) and have a BAQAF IMT 8 shall be assigned, at a minimum, FTL E continuation training requirements and GTL 4. 4.5.4.1.  If possible, schedule senior officers for the annual simulator refresher course (G250).    Ifnot, ensure that senior officers are afforded all of the training in the aircraft that would have beenaccomplished in the simulator.  Provide this training on local sorties not on operational missions.Include approaches, transition, and all applicable CRM, emergency, and mission orientation brief-ings.  Instructors will log annual CRM refresher (G230) and simulator refresher course (G250) forsenior officers upon completion of local training sorties. AFI11-2C-38V1   20 APRIL 200623Table 4.1.

Senior officers maintaining NMR, BMC, or BAQ will accomplish only these events. 2. Flight surgeons will accomplish these events.  Flight surgeons without a mobility positionare not required to complete items in the MOB section. 3. Flight surgeons and aircrew members with multiple aircraft qualifications must accom-plish this requirement for each aircraft they fly. 4. Complete  every  fourth  quarter  after  completion  of  the  annual  flight  evaluation  (e.g.,accomplished 15 Jan 06, due 31 Mar 07). 24AFI11-2C-38V1   20 APRIL 20064.6.  Flying Continuation Training Requirements. Aircrew members will comply with the require-ments of Table 4.2. 4.6.1.  Dual-Seat Qualification.  All pilots will be dual seat qualified and may accomplish trainingevents in either seat. 4.6.2.  Senior officers and staff aircrew members maintaining BAQ will, at a minimum, complete FTLE requirements.  These requirements also apply to additional aircraft in which aircrew members maybe qualified.  In addition to flying with an instructor of like specialty, FTL E senior officer pilots mustbe current in takeoffs, landings, and instrument approaches prior to carrying passengers. 4.6.3.  Flight surgeon continuation training requirements are in AFI 11-202, Volume 1 and in ANGSUPP1 to AFI 11-202, Volume 1. Table 4.2.

Proration of Training. AFI 11-202, Volume 1 outlines proration of training requirements for air-crew members not available for flying duties or those changing TLs.  Perform the following formula stepsto determine training requirements for a select training period: AFI11-2C-38V1   20 APRIL 200625Step 1 – Convert number of days available to number of months available (see Table 4.9.). Step 2 – Look up Event Volume required. Step 3 – Determine Prorated Event Volume required using the following formula: Number of Months Available x    Event Volume ÷    6 (Number of Months in the Semiannual training period) =    Prorated Event Volume Required (round down to nearest whole number but  not less than 1)4.7.1.  When an aircrew member goes PCS to a unit flying the same aircraft model and has the sameTL or lower, give credit for training accomplished at the previous assignment.  Prorate trainingrequirements based on the time available (time at former base, plus time at new base, minus numberof days not available) during the training period.  Time available starts 7 days after sign-in forCONUS and 14 days after sign-in for OCONUS.  Subtract previous accomplishments from the pro-rated total to determine remaining requirements. Table 4.3.  Individual Availability.  Days Available   Months Available 0-15 16-45 46-75 76-105 106-135 136-165 >166 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 4.8.  Failure to Complete Continuation Training Requirements. AFI 11-202, Volume 1 contains addi-tional guidance.  Declare individuals NMR if they fail to complete ground or semiannual flying continua-tion training requirements.  See Chapter 1 of this instruction for waivers. 4.8.1.  Flight Training.  At the end of the semiannual training period, squadron commanders willreview ARMS products for those aircrew members who failed to accomplish all required semiannualflying training events.  Squadron commanders will either direct training necessary for the individualto regain MR status or consider a waiver.  If the ARMS review shows enough flying events wererecently accomplished to ensure MR proficiency, the squadron commander may waive the require-ments.  The same flying training events will not be waived for two consecutive training periods.  Thiswaiver authority must be used judiciously.  The intent is to ensure aircrew members receive the properquantity of flying events to remain proficient and allow squadron commanders to determine MR sta-tus and additional training requirements when those training quotas are not met.  EXCEPTION:26AFI11-2C-38V1   20 APRIL 2006Events with a specific frequency (e.g., monthly, quarterly) in the currency column of training tableswill only be waived under extreme circumstances and only by NGB/A3T. 4.8.1.1.  Loss of Currency.  Place individuals delinquent in one or more currency events in super-vised training status for that event and declare them NMR in those unit missions requiring thatevent.  Aircrew members are non-current the day after event currency expires (e.g., an aircrewmember who accomplished an event with monthly currency on 1 September becomes non-currenton 1 November).  Regain currency IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 1. 4.8.2.  Ground Training.  Squadron commanders may waive ground continuation training.  Thiswaiver authority must be used judiciously.  The decision to grant a waiver will be based on the indi-vidual crewmember’s experience and proficiency level (i.e., waivers will not be based on a crewmem-ber’s availability).

A2.1.1.  Initiate a training folder, AF Form 4022, for the ETCA formal training (either at formalschool or in-unit), mission qualification, special qualification or certification training, in-unit upgradeprogram to the next higher crew qualification, requalification training (either at formal school orin-unit), or for any corrective action or additional training. A2.1.1.1.  The unit operations officer may waive the training folder requirement if correctiveaction or additional training is limited.  If initiated, the instructor or flight examiner who evaluatedthe aircrew member’s performance will enter comments pertinent to the training deficiency on AFIMT 4023 or the training guide.  Use the existing training folder for end-of-course evaluations thatresult in additional training. A2.1.1.2.  At the unit commander’s discretion, training folders for an individual undergoing morethan one training program in a short period of time may be combined into one AF Form 4022.  Forexample, a previous instructor in the MDS upgrading to AC may have his or her mission upgradecombined with instructor upgrade in the same folder. A2.1.2.  Formal schools will send AF Form 4022 with all training records to the trainee’s gaining unit.Squadron commanders will review formal school training records and may enter appropriate com-ments on the training guide progress record or AF IMT 4023. A2.1.3.  Squadrons will maintain the training folders for their personnel in a location readily accessi-ble to instructors and supervisory personnel.  The trainee may review his or her folder at any time. A2.1.4.  The instructor or trainer will review the training folder, to include AF IMTs 4023 and 4024 orthe training guide, prior to all training periods.  Those areas not previously accomplished or those, inwhich aircrew members require additional training, will be noted for possible inclusion during thecurrent training period.  Operations officers will review active training folders quarterly, and flightcommanders or squadron training representatives will conduct a monthly review.  Monthly and quar-terly reviews will be annotated on AF IMT 4023 or in the training guide. A2.1.5.  Upon completion of training, place the summary/closeout report (AF IMT 4025) in the indi-vidual’s flight evaluation folder (FEF) or in a permanent training folder, as specified in MAJCOMsupplement.  Squadrons will retain all AF Forms 4022 contents for 1 year, then return them to the air-crew member.  Do not insert AF Form 4022, AF IMT 4023, or 4024 or training guides into FEFs. A2.1.6.  If training guides are not used, AF IMTs 4023, 4024, and 4025 may be used for ATS and for-mal school courses. A2.1.7.  Units may overprint versions of AF Form 4022, AF IMTs 4023, 4024, and/or 4025 IAW AFI33-360, Volume 2, Content Management Program-Information Management Tool.
