At a minimum, this manual will—     Provide the doctrinal tools to plan, prepare, and execute CBRN R&S operations to identify and report CBRN hazards and related precursors that U.S. forces or its allies may encounter.  Incorporate current doctrine contained in Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Reconnaissance. Incorporate current doctrine contained in Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Biological Surveillance, which is rescinded upon publication of this MTTP. Incorporate  and  implement  the  following  North  Atlantic  Treaty  Organization  (NATO) Standardization Agreements (STANAGs) (unclassified) and other international CBRN published guidance (treaties, agreements, conventions):  STANAG 2002 (Edition 10). STANAG 2103/NATO ATP-45(D). STANAG 2150 (Edition 7).  STANAG 2451 (Edition 3). STANAG 2522 (Edition 1).     Note. This manual addresses tactics, techniques, and procedures associated with site assessment. For information on site exploitation, see Multi-Service Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Weapons of Mass Destruction Elimination Operations. PURPOSE The purpose of this publication is to provide a standardized reference for use by all Services while conducting CBRN R&S. It serves as a basis for developing Service-specific manuals and tactical-level standing operating procedures (SOPs), refining existing Service training products (U.S. Army training support packages, combined arms training strategies, U.S. Marine Corps Training and Readiness Manuals), informing training center and unit  exercises,  guiding  Service  school  curricula,  and  driving  the  examination  of  organizations  and  materiel developments applicable to military support of CBRN R&S. Note. CBRN hazards include those created from the accidental or intentional releases of toxic industrial materials (TIMs), biological pathogens, and radioactive matter. APPLICATION This publication is designed for use at the tactical level, but has implications at operational and strategic levels. This manual is applicable to conventional force commanders and staffs at all echelons. It applies to the active and reserve components and military forces of allied countries while serving under U.S. control. The manual supports command staffs, CBRN staff officers, CBRN enlisted personnel, and non-CBRN personnel performing or assigned R&S missions or tasks. This publication is not directive in authority, and no part of this document should  be  construed  as  limiting  commanders’  freedom  of  action  or  committing  commanders  to  a  fixed  or particular  course  of  action  (COA). Nor  should  it  be  construed  to  imply  that  specific  tactics,  techniques, and procedures  (TTP)  are  to  be  used  in  all  situations.  Commanders  may  apply  the  doctrine  and  information presented in this manual in any manner appropriate to their particular situation and mission and may compel viii ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 25 March 2013 Preface compliance through separate orders, regulations, or directives.

Accordingly,  this  publication  is  renamed:  Multi-Service  Tactics,  Techniques,  and  Procedures  for  Chemical, Biological,  Radiological,  and  Nuclear  Reconnaissance and Surveillance.  Its primary  purpose  is  to provide  a standardized  reference  for  use  by  all  Services  while  conducting  CBRN  R&S  operations.  This  publication contains  several  key  modifications  that  were  required  to  update  and  coalesce  existing  R&S  doctrine.  It  is ultimately  designed  to  provide  commanders  with  detailed,  timely,  and  accurate  CBRN  intelligence  to  gain situational understanding of CBRN threats and hazards. Using a “plan, prepare, and execute” construct, this publication seeks to organize those activities necessary to ensure effective resource management and synchronize the efforts of staffs and leaders. In particular,  execution activities are organized into a structural hierarchy that seeks to illustrate the elements of CBRN R&S. These elements are forms, modes, methods, tasks, and techniques. CBRN reconnaissance operations are partitioned into  three  possible  forms  (route,  zone,  and  area),  as  are  CBRN  surveillance  operations  (area,  point,  and medical). There are three modes common to CBRN reconnaissance and surveillance (mounted, dismounted, and aerial),  while  there  are  four  methods  (standoff,  remote,  direct,  and  indirect).  There  are  five  common  CBRN R&S tasks (detect, identify, quantify, collect samples, and report). CBRN reconnaissance-unique tasks (locate, survey, and mark) are supported by thirteen specific techniques, and CBRN surveillance-unique tasks (observe and  monitor)  have  four  embedded  techniques.  This  structure  is  intended  to  provide  a  systematic  means  of promoting  the  production  of  usable  information  that  supports  the  commander’s  critical  information requirements  (CCIR)  relative  to  CBRN  threats  and  hazards.  The  selection  of  the  appropriate  CBRN  R&S element  to  satisfy  information  requirements  is  accomplished  after  methodically  allowing  for  the  mission, enemy, terrain and weather, troops and support available, time available, and civil considerations (METT-TC). Another significant change in this manual is the migration to the new Department of Defense (DOD) four-tier system  for  determining  the  identity  of  CBRN  hazards.  The  identification  levels  are:  presumptive,  field confirmatory,  theater  validation,  and  definitive.  This  publication  becomes  the  proponent  for  doctrinal definitions of these four identification levels. It must be noted that forward-deployed U.S. Navy medical assets possess the ability to conduct field confirmatory and theater validation level analyses and, as such, have opted to  continue  to  operate  in  the  legacy  three-tiered  system.  These  identification  levels  support  applied  military decisionmaking at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels. Finally, this publication introduces the sample management process and notes the vital role played by precise sample  collection  techniques  in  eventually  providing  commanders  with the  analyzed data  necessary  to  make informed CBRN protection, prophylaxis, and medical treatment decisions. While environmental samples and clinical specimens are included in the sample  management process, clinical specimens are only collected by specially trained personnel. Clinical specimens will not be discussed in this manual, and the reader should refer to Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Health Service Support in a CBRN environment for more information on clinical specimen collection.  25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 xi This page intentionally left blank.    Chapter 1 Fundamentals This chapter introduces the ISR process and associated CBRN aspects. It provides the fundamentals  for  how  CBRN  R&S  is  integrated  into  joint  and  Service  warfighting functions, CBRN passive defense operational elements, and CBRN passive defense principles. It also provides CBRN R&S principles. INTELLIGENCE, SURVEILLANCE, AND RECONNAISSANCE 1-1.  CBRN R&S are part of a commander’s overall ISR operations. CBRN R&S provide CBRN data and information to intelligence. Intelligence is the product resulting from the collection, processing, integration, evaluation,  analysis,  and  interpretation  of  available  information  concerning  foreign  nations,  hostile  or potentially hostile forces or elements, or areas of actual or potential operations (JP 1-02) The end state of R&S operations is intelligence that supports a commander’s decisionmaking at all levels. 1-2.  Developing situational understanding of the operational environment is critical to achieve success in military operations. Knowledge about the operational environment requires proactive and continuous R&S to  acquire  information.  Information  that  is  collected  from  multiple  sources  and  analyzed  becomes intelligence  that  provides  answers  to    CCIRs  concerning  the  adversary,  climate,  weather,  terrain,  and population. Developing this is the function of ISR. 1-3.  ISR is an activity that synchronizes, integrates, and processes information from sensors and assets for exploitation  and  information  dissemination in  direct  support of  current and  future operations.  This  is  an integrated  intelligence  and  operations  function.  For  military  forces,  this  activity  is  a  joint  operation  that focuses  on  priority  intelligence  requirements  (PIRs)  while  answering  the  CCIRs.  Through  ISR, commanders  and  staffs  continuously  plan,  task,  and  employ  collection  assets  and  forces.  These  assets collect,  process,  and  disseminate  timely  and  accurate  combat  information  and  intelligence  to  satisfy  the CCIRs and other intelligence requirements. ISR supports military operations through—   Synchronization. Integration. 1-4.  This publication focuses on CBRN R&S. The terms reconnaissance and surveillance are, in many cases, used synonymously, yet they are in fact two separate and distinct tasks of ISR operations:   Reconnaissance  a  mission  undertaken  to  obtain,  by  visual  observation  or  other  detection methods,  information  about  the  activities  and  resources  of  an  adversary,  or  to  secure  data concerning the meteorological, hydrographic, or geographic characteristics of a particular area. (JP-1-02) Surveillance  is  the  systematic  observation  of  aerospace,  surface,  or  subsurface  areas,  places, persons, or things, by visual, aural, electronic, photographic, or other means. (JP-1-02)  1-5.  The purpose of CBRN R&S is to provide commanders with detailed, timely, and accurate CBRN intelligence, by visual observation or CBRN detection methods, and to gain situational understanding of CBRN  threats  and  hazards.  Information  that  is  collected  from  multiple  sources  and  analyzed  becomes intelligence  that  provides  answers  to  the  CCIR/PIR  concerning  an  adversary  use  of  CBRN  weapons  or regarding impacts of an accidental release of CBRN material. 1-6.  Understanding  the  difference  between  R&S  allows  the  CBRN  staff  planner  to  better  advise  the commander  regarding  the  employment  of  CBRN  R&S  assets.  As  described  above,  their  purposes  differ through separate means by which the information/intelligence required is observed and collected. Simply put, CBRN reconnaissance can be considered an active means of observation and collection while CBRN surveillance is a passive means. 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 1-1 Chapter 1 1-7.  Surveillance is passive and may be continuous; reconnaissance missions have finite objectives and use  active  means  (such  as  movement).  Commanders  complement  surveillance  with  frequent reconnaissance.  Surveillance,  in  turn,  increases  the  efficiency  of  reconnaissance  by  focusing  on  those identified  missions  to  reduce  the  risk  to  personnel.  R&S  can  be  independent  or  complimentary  of  one another. When used together, they can create a synergy of greater value than when used separately. RELEVANCE TO JOINT AND SERVICE WARFIGHTING FUNCTIONS 1-8.  While  this  manual focuses on  CBRN  R&S,  the  CBRN  staff planner  must  understand  how  CBRN R&S is relevant to the joint and Service warfighting functions. The joint and Service warfighting functions are—   Command and control (C2).  Intelligence. Fires.    Movement and maneuver.  Protection. Sustainment.  Note. The U.S. Army uses the term mission command instead of C2. 1-9.  CBRN R&S directly supports the joint and Service warfighting function of intelligence. Intelligence provides  commanders  with  an  understanding  of  the  operational  environment.  The  intelligence  function includes planning and direction, to include managing counterintelligence activities, collection, processing, and exploitation, analysis, production, dissemination, integration, evaluation, and feedback. It also supports military decisionmaking associated with the commander’s decisions for operations, medical decisions, and forensics-based attribution. (For more information on the joint and Service warfighting functions, see JP 3-0.) RELEVANCE TO CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR PASSIVE DEFENSE OPERATIONAL ELEMENTS 1-10.  CBRN R&S is principally focused on informing the military mission area (MMA) of CBRN passive defense.  However,  CBRN  R&S  provides  critical  input  to  MMAs;  weapons  of  mass  destruction  (WMD) security  cooperation  and  partner  activities;  threat  reduction  cooperation;  WMD  interdiction,  WMD offensive  operations,  WMD  elimination,  WMD  active  defense,  CBRN  passive  defense,  and  WMD consequence  management.  For  more  information  on  the  eight  MMAs,  see  JP  3-40  and  Multi-Service Doctrine for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Operations. 1-11.  CBRN passive defense encompasses passive measures taken to minimize or negate the vulnerability to,  and  effects  of,  CBRN  incidents  causing  a  high  order  of  destruction  or  mass  casualties.  CBRN  R&S provides critical input to CBRN passive defense and its operational elements. The CBRN passive defense operational elements are—   CBRN shape.   CBRN sense.   CBRN shield.   CBRN sustain. 1-12.  CBRN  R&S  directly  supports  the  CBRN  passive  defense  operational  element  of  CBRN  sense. CBRN  sense  entails  activities  that  provide  continuous  CBRN  threat  and  hazard  (potential  or  actual) information and intelligence to support the COP through CBRN R&S early detection, identification, and determination  of  the  scope  of  hazards.  CBRN  sense  provides  the  capability  to  continually  provide  the information about the CBRN situation at a time and place by detecting, identifying, and quantifying CBRN hazards  in  the  air  and  water  and  on  land,  personnel,  equipment,  and  facilities.  This  capability  includes detecting, identifying, and quantifying CBRN hazards in all physical states (solid, liquid, gas). CBRN sense is also key to CBRN contamination avoidance. 1-2 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 25 March 2013 Fundamentals 1-13.  Success for CBRN defense operations begins with synchronizing the joint and Service warfighting functions that are common to joint operations at all levels of war with the operational elements of CBRN passive defense (CBRN shape, CBRN sense, CBRN shield, and CBRN sustain). RELEVANCE TO THE PRINCIPLES OF CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR DEFENSE 1-14.  CBRN R&S directly supports the principles of CBRN defense, which are—   Avoidance of CBRN hazards.    Decontamination to restore operational capability. Protection of individuals, units, and equipment from unavoidable CBRN hazards. 1-15.  CBRN  R&S  implements  CBRN  contamination  avoidance  through  detection,  identification,  and quantification of CBRN hazards. The implications of detection may include— Predicting.    Warning and reporting.   Marking.   Relocating and rerouting.   Treatment.   Verification.   Changes  in  individual  protective  equipment  (IPE)  and  personal  protective  equipment  (PPE) levels. 1-16.  For  more  information  regarding  CBRN  contamination  avoidance,  see  Multi-Service  Tactics, Techniques,  and  Procedures  for  Chemical,  Biological,  Radiological,  and  Nuclear  Contamination Avoidance. CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR ASPECTS OF INTELLIGENCE, SURVEILLANCE, AND RECONNAISSANCE SYNCHRONIZATION AND INTEGRATION 1-17.  CBRN R&S is part of the cyclical ISR process. During the phases of the ISR process, the CBRN staff integrates CBRN R&S whenever there is a CBRN threat or hazard. The CBRN staff provides input to the overall ISR process, seeks to define what information is required, determines the best method to collect the  information,  allocates  assets  to  collect  the  information,  disseminates  intelligence  derived  from  the information,  and  assesses  the  value  of  the  intelligence.  Figure  1-1,  page  1-4,  depicts  the  ISR synchronization and integration process. 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 1-3 Chapter 1  Legend: IPB IPOE ISR MDMP PIR Figure 1-1.

CBRN reconnaissance operations are those operations undertaken to obtain, by visual observation or other detection  methods, information on the potential or actual CBRN hazards and threats in an area of operations.  CBRN  reconnaissance  primarily  relies  on  technology  rather  than  human  observation.  CBRN reconnaissance  is  a  focused  collection  effort.  It  is  performed  in  support  of  operations  to  provide information  used  in  the  intelligence  preparation  of  the  operational  environment  (POE)/intelligence preparation  of  the  battlespace  (IPB)  process,  and  in  support  of  the  commander’s  ability  to  formulate, confirm, or modify the COA. 1-19.  The principles of CBRN reconnaissance include—   Ensure continuous CBRN reconnaissance. CBRN reconnaissance is conducted before, during, and  after  operations.  Before  an  operation,  CBRN  reconnaissance  focuses  on  filling  gaps  in information  about  an  adversary’s  CBRN  capabilities,  specific  hazard  considerations,  and  the terrain. During an operation, CBRN reconnaissance focuses on providing the commander with updated CBRN information that verifies CBRN hazards. This information may include location, type, intensity, persistence, size, and any other characteristics that may support the commander’s decisionmaking. This allows commanders to verify which COA is actually being adopted by the adversary and to determine if the plan is still valid based on actual events in the operational area. After an operation, CBRN reconnaissance focuses on providing situational awareness as to the area,  extent,  and  duration  of  the  CBRN  threats  and  hazards  in  the  operational  area  and  on collecting the information necessary for planning subsequent CBRN operations. In stability or civil  support  operations,  CBRN  reconnaissance  focuses  on  specific  civilian  hazard considerations. 1-4 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 25 March 2013 Fundamentals   Do not keep CBRN reconnaissance assets in reserve.  CBRN reconnaissance  assets, like artillery  assets,  are  never  kept  in  reserve. When  committed,  CBRN  reconnaissance  assets  use their resources to accomplish the mission. (This does not mean that all assets are committed all the  time.)  Commanders  use  CBRN  reconnaissance  assets  based  on  their  capabilities  and METT-TC to achieve the maximum coverage needed to answer the CBRN CCIRs. At times, this requires commanders to withhold or position CBRN reconnaissance assets so that they are available at critical times and places. The rest required by CBRN reconnaissance assets to  sustain  the CBRN  reconnaissance  effort  is  not  to  be obtained by  placing  them  in  reserve. However,  CBRN  reconnaissance  assets  should  be  treated  as  committed  assets  with  specific missions assigned. This fundamental does not apply to R&S elements with multiple roles that can  conduct  CBRN in  an economy-of-force role. reconnaissance,  security,  and  other  combat  missions Note. The U.S. Marine Corps uses the acronym METT-T (mission, enemy, terrain and weather,  troops  and  support  available—time  available).  Civilian  considerations  are inherently measured within the context of the acronym.   Orient  on  the  CBRN  reconnaissance  objective.  The  commander  uses the  CBRN reconnaissance  objective  to  focus  the  CBRN  reconnaissance  efforts  of  the  R&S  element. Commanders of subordinate CBRN R&S elements remain focused on achieving this objective, regardless of what their forces encounter during the mission.   Report  information  rapidly  and  accurately.  CBRN  reconnaissance  assets  must  acquire  and report  accurate  and  timely  information  on  the  CBRN  threats  and  hazards  and  other  relevant information  observed  while  performing  their  principle  task  of  CBRN  reconnaissance. Information may quickly lose its value. CBRN R&S elements report exactly what they see and, if  appropriate,  what  they  do  not  see.  Seemingly  unimportant  information  may  be  extremely important  when  combined  with  other  information.  Negative  reports  should  be  forwarded  to higher  headquarters  for  review  or  collaboration,  as  they  may  fill  in  gaps  of  the  overall  ISR picture. The unit information management plan ensures that CBRN R&S element assets have the proper communication equipment to support the integrated ISR. their  missions.  If   Retain  freedom  of  action.  CBRN  reconnaissance  assets  must  retain  battlespace  mobility  to successfully  complete these  assets  are  decisively  engaged,  CBRN reconnaissance stops and a battle for survival begins. CBRN reconnaissance assets must have clear  engagement  criteria  that  support  the  commander’s  intent.  They  must  employ  proper movement  and  CBRN  reconnaissance  techniques,  and  use  overwatching  fires  and  SOPs. Initiative  and  knowledge  of  the  terrain  and  the  adversary  reduce  the  likelihood  of  decisive engagement and help maintain freedom of movement. When conducting CBRN reconnaissance, the  CBRN  R&S  element  adopts  a  combat  formation  designed  to  limit  exposure  to  CBRN hazards. This provides the R&S element with the maximum opportunity to move across terrain without  the  entire  R&S  element  becoming  contaminated.  The  IPOE/IPB  process  can  identify anticipated CBRN hazard areas/locations.    Gain and maintain CBRN hazard understanding. When an R&S element conducting CBRN reconnaissance detects or locates a CBRN hazard, it works to gather and maintain information about the hazard for reporting to its higher headquarters.    Develop the situation rapidly. When a CBRN reconnaissance asset encounters a CBRN hazard, it must quickly determine the threat it faces. For a new CBRN hazard, it must determine the type of hazard,  CCIR, and PIR relevance and assess the implications of the hazard information. 1-20.  The forms of CBRN reconnaissance are—   Route reconnaissance. The purpose of route reconnaissance is to provide detailed information on  trafficability,  adversary  activity,  CBRN  contamination,  and  the  adjacent  terrain  from  the viewpoint  of  adversary  and  friendly  forces.  Route  reconnaissance  focuses  on  obtaining information  about  a  specified  route  and  terrain  from  which  a  CBRN  hazard  could  influence movement along that route. Route reconnaissance can orient on a road, railway, waterway, or 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 1-5 Chapter 1 general  direction  of  attack  to  provide  new  or  updated  information  on  route  contamination conditions or activities along the route.   Area reconnaissance. The purpose of area reconnaissance is to confirm or deny the presence of potential  or  suspected  CBRN  threats/hazards  or  contamination  within  a  given  area.  Before moving forces into or near a specified area, the commander may call on his CBRN R&S element to  conduct  an  area  reconnaissance.  The  area  could  be  a  town,  ridgeline,  woods,  or  another feature that friendly forces intend to occupy, pass through, or avoid. The commander frequently employs area reconnaissance to gain information on objective areas, to confirm the IPOE/IPB templates, and to provide detailed information regarding CBRN threats and hazards. Within an operational area, area reconnaissance can focus the reconnaissance on the specific locale that is critical to the commander. This form of focusing the reconnaissance also permits the mission to be accomplished more quickly.   Zone reconnaissance. The purpose of a zone reconnaissance is to obtain information on CBRN threats and hazards affecting terrain and routes within a specified zone. The zone reconnaissance form  includes  the  use  of  moving  elements,  stationary  teams,  or  multiple  area  reconnaissance actions. Commanders normally assign a CBRN zone reconnaissance mission to the CBRN R&S element  when  they  need  detailed  information  before  moving  their  forces  into  or  through  the zone. The reconnaissance provides the commander with a detailed picture of the CBRN threat or hazard,  enabling  him  to  choose  the  appropriate  COA.  The  CBRN  R&S  element  conducts terrain-oriented  CBRN  zone  reconnaissance  to  gain  detailed  information  about  routes,  terrain, and resources within the assigned zone. This is the most thorough and complete reconnaissance mission; and therefore, it is very time-intensive. Note.  Route,  area,  and  zone  reconnaissance  may  include  finding  a  bypass  (clear)  route  that allows forces to avoid contamination. 1-21.  CBRN reconnaissance provides commanders with information on CBRN hazards in an operational area.  The key tasks  for  CBRN  reconnaissance  are  identified  below (further  task  details  can  be  found  in chapter 4):   Detect CBRN hazards.   Locate CBRN hazards. Identify CBRN hazards.    Quantify CBRN hazards.   Collect environmental CBRN samples.   Conduct CBRN surveys.   Mark CBRN hazards.   Report CBRN hazards. CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR SURVEILLANCE OPERATIONS 1-22.  CBRN  surveillance  is  the  systematic  observation  of  aerospace,  surface,  or  subsurface  locations, places, persons, or things, by visual, aural, electronic, photographic, or other means to confirm or deny the presence of CBRN hazards. CBRN surveillance facilitates situational understanding and maintenance of an accurate, high fidelity, real-time picture of the operational environment as changes occur. 1-23.  The commander will use available assets (intelligence, medical, and CBRN surveillance) to detect CBRN hazards. Resulting detection information will aid in decisionmaking to reduce the effects of CBRN hazards  and  feed  directly  into  the  U.S.  force  warning  and  reporting  network  when  appropriate.  In conjunction  with  intelligence,  medical  and  CBRN  surveillance  are  used  to  assess  the  potential  use  of CBRN weapons by the adversary (for example, signals intelligence may intercept threat employment orders for  a  CBRN  attack).  Human  intelligence  (HUMINT)  may  also  provide  information  on  future  threat intentions and CBRN weapon manufacturing capabilities and locations. Medical surveillance assesses the 1-6 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 25 March 2013 incidence of illness to determine whether a CBRN incident may have occurred. CBRN surveillance serves as another critical component of awareness. 1-24.  The principles of CBRN surveillance include— Fundamentals   Maintain continuous CBRN surveillance on CBRN named areas of interest (NAIs). Once the CBRN surveillance of a NAI commences, CBRN surveillance must be maintained until the mission is completed or terminated by the higher commander. Commanders designate to whom the CBRN information will be reported and the means of communication. Continuous CBRN surveillance on NAIs requires multiple collection assets, a purpose (PIRs), and a location (NAI or  target  area  of  interest  [TAI])  for  each  CBRN  asset.  During  CBRN  ISR  synchronization, CBRN  collection  assets  are  selected  that  can  best  answer  the  CBRN-specific  information requirements (SIRs) generated from the CCIR. During CBRN ISR integration, specific assets are tasked  to  perform  these  missions,  using  the  tools  developed  during  ISR  synchronization  to ensure continuous coverage.   Avoid designating too many CBRN NAIs. Continuous CBRN surveillance suffers as a result of excessive NAIs. Coordinators for surveillance assets should be present at ISR rehearsals to determine appropriate tasking and ability to cover particular NAIs.   Provide  continuous  observation  before,  during,  and  after  operations.  Within  present capabilities, commanders strive to maximize CBRN assets, including processing and analysis, to provide  persistent  observation  before,  during,  and  after  operations.  Before  initial  entry  into  a theater of operations, national assets are the major sources of CBRN information. Once in the operational  area,  CBRN  surveillance  is  deployed  as  early  as  possible  to  help  focus  CBRN reconnaissance  efforts  and  provide  early  warning.  During  operations,  CBRN  surveillance supports target acquisition, discovers information that cues CBRN reconnaissance, answers the CBRN CCIR, and assists the commander and staff in assessing operations. CBRN surveillance helps look for remnants of adversary CBRN capabilities or activity and provides information to begin subsequent CBRN planning.   Orient CBRN surveillance to provide early and accurate warning. One of the main purposes of CBRN surveillance is to provide early warning of imminent CBRN hazards. Together with IPOE/IPB, commanders use CBRN surveillance to assess the most dangerous and most probable threats/hazards and ascertain the most likely location or direction in which these will come. They then  orient  CBRN  surveillance  assets  to  observe  these  locations  for  indicators  of  threat  to friendly  forces.  Reports  of  threat  must  be  early  and  accurate,  with  timely  processing  and dissemination.   Track and assess key CBRN threats and hazards. CBRN surveillance support for targeting includes tracking and assessing. Once a CBRN threat or hazard is detected, planning cells must also consider the need to maintain visibility on the hazard.   Provide  continuous,  redundant,  and  overlapping  coverage  on  critical locations. Commanders  integrate  the  capabilities  of  limited  CBRN  surveillance  assets  to  provide continuous  coverage  of  critical  locations  identified  during  planning.  Commanders  and  staff continuously  assess  CBRN  surveillance  results  to  determine  changes  in  critical  locations requiring this level of coverage. The intelligence and operations staff work together to achieve balance in the use of CBRN assets with cueing, mixing, and redundancy in an attempt to use limited assets most effectively and collect the most critical information with the fewest assets as quickly as possible.    Cueing  is  the  integration  of  one  or  more  types  of  CBRN  R&S  systems  to  provide information  that  directs  follow-on  collection  of  more  detailed  information  by  another system.  Cueing  helps  to  focus  limited  reconnaissance  assets,  especially  limited  ground CBRN R&S assets, which can rarely examine every part of a large area/location closely. Electronic,  thermal,  visual,  audio,  and  other  technical  assets  with  wide-area  surveillance capabilities, often working from aerial platforms, can quickly determine areas of adversary concentration or areas where there is no adversary presence. These assets may cue ground and  air  reconnaissance  assets  to  investigate  specific  locations  to  confirm  and  amplify information developed by technical assets (for example, aerial capabilities can cover large areas and cue CBRN ground reconnaissance or an unmanned aircraft system [UAS] once a 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 1-7 Chapter 1 CBRN hazard is identified). The commander may dispatch CBRN ground reconnaissance to verify  the  information  and  mark  the  area.  Or  he  may  dispatch  a  UAS  to  verify  the information for operational purposes. Similarly, a CBRN ground reconnaissance capability could cue CBRN surveillance capabilities. The  key point is to use CBRN reconnaissance assets based on their capabilities and use the complementary capabilities of other assets to verify and expand available information.   Mixing is using two or more different CBRN assets to collect against the same intelligence requirement  while  providing  an  increased  probability  of  detection  and  confidence. Employing a mix of systems not only increases the probability of detection, but also tends to provide  more  complete  information  (for  example,  a  standoff  capability  may  detect  and locate a CBRN hazard, while the intelligence analysis and control element uses organic and supporting  assets  to  determine  its  identity  and  threat  to  military  forces  and  future  plans). Employing  a  mix  of  systems  is  always  desirable  if  the  situation  and  available  resources permit. Mixing systems can also help uncover deception attempts by revealing discrepancies in information reported by different CBRN teams.   Redundancy is using two or more like-CBRN assets to collect against the same intelligence requirement while providing an increased probability of detection and confidence. Based on the  PIR,  the  commander  must  decide  which  NAI  justifies  having  more  than  one  asset covering it. When more than one asset covers the same NAI, a backup is available. In the event that one asset cannot reach the NAI in time, the first asset suffers mechanical failure or  the  adversary  detects  and  engages  the  first  asset.  Redundancy  also  improves  the probability of detecting and collecting the required information.   Report information rapidly and accurately. Commanders may base their planning and tactical decisions  on  information  obtained  through  CBRN  surveillance  efforts.  Intelligence  loses  its relevance as it ages. Commanders establish the latest time information is of value (LTIOV) to guide timely reporting. The R&S element or other asset must accurately report what it observes and report it in a timely manner. Digitization speeds the process and assists in accuracy. Speed is critical when conducting early warning and reporting of a CBRN incident. 1-25.  The forms of CBRN surveillance are—   CBRN point surveillance. The purpose of CBRN point surveillance is to provide intermittent or continuous observation of a specific CBRN-related place (such as a structure), person, or object. This  can be  associated with, but  is not  limited  to,  a  TAI or  a NAI.  CBRN  point  surveillance ensures  that  time-sensitive  critical  operations  can  be  conducted  without  unwarned  encounters with CBRN hazards/plumes. It is important to note that detection of a hazard may occur before or after exposure to personnel. Point surveillance is the most limited in geographic scope of all forms of surveillance.    CBRN  area  surveillance.  The  purpose  of  CBRN  area  surveillance  is  to  provide  greater detection  capability  in  large  areas.  CBRN  area  surveillance  is  the  temporary  or  continuous observation of a specific prescribed geographic area. It can be associated with, but is not limited to, a CBRN TAI or a CBRN NAI. This area may include a town, neighborhood, cluster or group of buildings, or other man-made or geographic feature. Unlike area reconnaissance, it does not include individual structures, such as a bridge or single building. The uses of detectors (deployed in arrays) and standoff detectors are key to the coverage of larger areas.   Medical surveillance. The CBRN surveillance process can include health surveillance. Health surveillance  is  the  regular  or  ongoing  systematic  collection,  analysis,  and  interpretation  of health-related  data  essential  to  the  evaluation,  planning,  and  implementation  of  public  health practice.  The  systematic  collection  of  health  care  information  is  essential  to  the  surveillance process.  Health  surveillance  includes  medical,  occupational,  and  environmental  surveillance. This information is used to monitor the health of a population and to identify potential risks to health,  disease,  and  injury—thereby  enabling  timely  interventions  to  prevent,  treat,  or  control exposure. The foundation of a health surveillance program is the determination of unit-specific illness and injury rates of public health significance (see Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures  for  Health  Service  Support  in  a  Chemical,  Biological,  Radiological,  and  Nuclear Environment).  Health  surveillance  may  provide  the  first  indicator  that  a  CBRN  incident  has 1-8 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 25 March 2013 Fundamentals occurred. If an incident is not detected directly, the first indication may be an increase of illness among  the  affected  population.  Some  hazards  induce  symptoms  after  an  incubation  period (biological)  or  prolonged  exposure  (radiation  and  chemical).  An  influx  of  patients  reporting similar symptoms may indicate that an incident has occurred. 1-26.  The  following  are  key  tasks  for  CBRN  surveillance  (chapter  4  provides  further  details  for  each CBRN surveillance task):   Monitor CBRN hazards.   Observe CBRN hazards.   Detect CBRN hazards. Identify CBRN hazards.    Quantify CBRN hazards.   Collect environmental CBRN samples.   Report CBRN hazards. SUMMARY 1-27.  Commanders and their staffs evaluate CBRN R&S information to assess its impact on operations and help mitigate the impact of assessed CBRN hazard. This chapter focuses on the fundamentals of CBRN R&S in support of combat operations and as a focused application of special/unique capabilities supporting reconnaissance operations. The remaining chapters and appendixes discuss CBRN R&S from the following perspectives:   The military operation supported unit/higher headquarters staff.   The assets of the supporting units that are CBRN R&S capabilities. 1-28.  The  military  force  has  the  ability  to  analyze  the  CBRN  aspects  of  ISR  products  that  meet  the technical  CBRN  hazard  detection  requirements  of  users.  This  capability  provides  relevant  CBRN environment  information  for  integration  into  operational  activities.  The  end  results  are  products  that describe the CBRN hazard environment for operational planning, preparation, execution, and continuous assessment. 1-29.  The  CBRN  staff  translates  ISR  products  and  all  source  information  into  an  understanding  of  the CBRN threat and the operational environment for CBRN defense actions. This process requires—   Timely conduct to assess vulnerability.    CBRN  warning  and  reporting  on  potential  and  actual  CBRN  incidents  to  facilitate  risk Specific COAs to reduce vulnerability and counterspecific threats/hazards. assessments and actions to minimize the short- and long-term health effects of toxic exposures. is  processed into to  become 1-30.

Supporting CBRN defense execution through orders and risk management.    Maintaining situational awareness (SA) with man-in-the-loop assessment. 1-31.  The CBRN staff focuses on knowing what data is relevant, determining what can be collected before events,  and  developing  a  data  collection  plan  to  obtain  other  data.  The  CBRN  staff  processes  data  into operationally significant information and develops a collection plan to obtain additional data if information is incomplete. The CBRN staff uses the military decisionmaking process (MDMP) to translate information into intelligence. It estimates and assesses hazards to develop possible COAs. 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 1-9 Chapter 1 Note.

For a comparison of the  MDMP  and  MCPP, see Multi-Service Tactics,  Techniques,  and  Procedures  for  Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Aspects of Command and Control. 1-32.  Understanding  requires SA. The  commander  uses  this  awareness  to  communicate  intent  and  issue orders that mitigate risk through application of various CBRN defense measures.  1-10 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 25 March 2013  Chapter 2 Planning Activities Chapter 1 introduced the ISR process and the associated CBRN aspects. This chapter will focus on the planning activities associated with the integration of CBRN into the overall development of the ISR plan. The ISR process is used by the CBRN officer in conjunction  with  the  intelligence  officer  and  staff  to  develop  the  CBRN  ISR  plan. This plan is in itself part of the overall ISR plan. The intelligence officer and CBRN officer are responsible for the development of the CBRN ISR plan. The purpose of integrating CBRN R&S into the ISR process is to incorporate all CBRN R&S assets and resources into a single plan. This will capitalize on each capability and succeed in synchronizing and coordinating CBRN R&S missions within the overall scheme of maneuver. A good CBRN ISR plan (see example in appendix B) fits into and supports the overall operations plan or order. It positions and tasks CBRN R&S assets so they can  collect  the  right  information,  sustain  or  reconstitute  for  branches  or  sequels (follow-on or emerging efforts), or shift priorities as the situation develops. CBRN ISR synchronization and integration together result in an effort focused on answering the  commander’s  CBRN  information  requirements  (IRs)  through  CBRN  ISR  tasks translated  into  orders.  The  CBRN  ISR  process  is  a  continuous  effort  that  refines, synchronizes,  and  integrates  CBRN  IRs  into  the  CBRN  ISR  plan.  Changes  to  the CBRN  ISR  plan  can  be  based  on,  or  influenced  by  (but  are  not  limited  to),  the following:       A CBRN CCIR is satisfied or is no longer relevant and frees a CBRN ISR asset for other operations. An example of this would be if a CBRN reconnaissance asset were tasked to find a bypass around a contaminated area and that bypass were no longer needed. The unit receives information that requires confirmation. This leads to a new tasking or retasking of a CBRN ISR asset. The timing of the operation has become desynchronized, requiring a modification of the LTIOV or changes to priorities.  The  commander  generates  new  CBRN  CCIR  as  the  COA  evolves  and  the  threat situation develops. A change to the adversary situation (the adversary follows an unexpected COA). Higher headquarters directs the unit to begin an unplanned operation. When CBRN ISR collection requirements are matched to actual CBRN R&S assets, the  result  is  the  CBRN  ISR  plan.  The  CBRN  ISR  synchronization  matrix  (see appendix B) is also developed and used to further define the use of CBRN ISR assets against CBRN IRs by describing the time and space for which the CBRN R&S effort will occur. 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 2-1 Chapter 2 CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR INTELLIGENCE, SURVEILLANCE, AND RECONNAISSANCE PLANNING FUNDAMENTALS 2-1.  CBRN ISR planning begins with the development of CBRN IRs and intelligence gaps. These CBRN requirements  eventually  become  CBRN  ISR  tasks  for  collection.  CBRN  ISR  planning  fundamentals include— Identifying CBRN IRs and intelligence gaps.    Developing CBRN indicators and SIRs.  Identifying CBRN R&S tasks.  2-2.  CBRN requirements are broken down into the following types:   CBRN PIR. CBRN PIR is a CBRN intelligence requirement, stated as a priority for intelligence support that the commander and staff need to understand the adversary or the CBRN operational environment.  CBRN  PIRs  are  associated  with  a  decision  based  on  an  adversary  action  or inaction  or  the  operational  area  that  will  affect  the  overall  success  of  the  mission.  The  staff selects these during mission analysis as part of the process for identifying the CBRN CCIR.   CBRN  intelligence  requirements.  CBRN  intelligence  requirements  are  essential  elements  of intelligence that will fill a gap in the commander’s knowledge or understanding of the CBRN operational environment or threat forces.   CBRN  IRs.  CBRN  IRs  are  items  of  CBRN  information  regarding  the  adversary  and  other relevant aspects of the CBRN operational environment that need to be collected and processed to meet the CBRN IRs of a commander.   CBRN indicators and SIRs. Each CBRN IR is broken down into CBRN indicators and CBRN SIRs that are used to develop the ISR plan and answer CBRN IRs. They—  Fill a gap in knowledge and understanding of the operational area or the threat. Support the development of situational understanding and answer gaps in the COP. Provide additional details required for analysis.   2-3.  During the initial receipt of a mission, the commander will provide guidance to the staff, which will include  CBRN  information  that  he  considers  critical.  This  guidance  will  be  refined  during  the  planning process into the CBRN CCIR. CBRN CCIR is CBRN IRs identified by the commander as being critical to facilitating timely decisionmaking. The key elements are CBRN friendly force information requirements (FFIRs) and CBRN PIR. CBRN FFIR is CBRN-related information that the commander and staff need to understand the status of friendly forces and supporting CBRN capabilities. 2-4.  During planning, the entire staff analyzes the CBRN CCIR and any requests for information (RFIs) and orders to identify gaps in information. 2-5.  CBRN ISR tasks are developed by the CBRN officer, intelligence officer, and staff for inclusion into the  CBRN  ISR  plan.  Figure  2-1  shows  the  CBRN  ISR  task  development  process.  Accurate  CBRN indicators are necessary to write effective CBRN ISR tasks. To do this, CBRN SIRs are developed using CBRN indicators. CBRN indicators are defined as information, which reflects the intention or capability of an  adversary  to  adopt  or  reject  a  COA.  Positive  or  negative  evidence  of  threat  CBRN  activity  or  any characteristic of the operational area, which points toward the adoption, or rejection of a particular threat COA may influence the commander’s selection of friendly COA. Indicators turn CBRN SIRs into effective CBRN ISR tasks by using directive statements with definable metrics. Examples of CBRN SIRs and ISR tasks are—    SIR: Determine if the adversary use persistent chemical agents along east west routes Omega and Delta between 180500ZJUL2009 and 170500ZJUL2009. ISR:  Report  chemical  agent  attacks  along  routes  Omega  and  Delta  between  170500  and 180500ZJUL2009 (LTIOV–181200ZJUL2009). SIR: Determine if the adversary release biological agents along the forward edge of the battle area during the initial phase of its attack. 2-2 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 25 March 2013 Planning Activities    ISR:  Report  any  positive  biological  attack  detections  or  indicators  along  phase  line  Bravo between 140500Z and 160900ZJUL2009 LTIOV 161200ZJUL2009).

CBRN ISR task development process 2-6.  CBRN R&S elements that have the capability to execute identified CBRN ISR tasks are identified. The following are some discriminators used to better identify a CBRN asset to perform a specific CBRN ISR task:  Is the CBRN R&S element equipped to execute the task? Is the CBRN R&S element trained to execute the task?    Can  the  CBRN  R&S  element  execute  the  CBRN  ISR  task  within  the  time  identified  for  the information to be of value?   Does the CBRN ISR task require a specialized or generic CBRN R&S element? For example, if a  CBRN  ISR  task  requires  biological  surveillance,  then  a  general-purpose  force  CBRN  R&S element may not be enough. 2-7.  Once  CBRN  ISR  tasks  have  been  identified  and  the  commander  has  approved  the  R&S  assets  to perform those tasks, then the CBRN ISR plan and CBRN ISR synchronization matrix can be created. This includes  the  development  of  the  CBRN  ISR  and  overlay  and  CBRN  ISR  collection  matrix  as  well. 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 2-3 Chapter 2 Appendix B provides examples of these CBRN ISR products (the CBRN ISR plan, overlay, and the CBRN ISR synchronization and collection matrixes). 2-8.  The CBRN synchronization matrix is integral to the overall ISR plan. It allows the CBRN officer and staff to synchronize CBRN R&S assets to CBRN ISR tasks at the proper point in the overall scheme of maneuver.  It  is  typically  done  in  a  spreadsheet  format.  Between  the  CBRN  plan  and  the  CBRN synchronization matrix, the following information is generally included:   CBRN PIRs and IRs.   CBRN indicators.   Times and dates of the collection mission or RFIs.   LTIOVs.   NAIs.   Available  assigned,  attached,  supporting,  and  higher  echelon  units  and  organizations  which possess CBRN collection assets to be tasked or requested for CBRN ISR tasks.   CBRN ISR tasks and RFIs.   CBRN SIRs to facilitate CBRN ISR integration.   Other information deemed necessary to support the management of the collection effort. 2-9.  CBRN missions can be task-organized in various ways dependent on the operational environment. If a subordinate unit has a CBRN R&S element embedded in its organization, the higher headquarters can task the unit to execute the CBRN R&S mission using its CBRN R&S element. If a unit that occupies the area  where  the  CBRN  R&S  task  must  be  accomplished  does  not  have  a  CBRN  R&S  element,  then  the higher headquarters can attach an R&S element to it. Various mission command/C2 relationships that can occur are further discussed in Multi-Service Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Aspects of Command and Control. 2-10.  CBRN  ISR  overlays  are  created  to  graphically  depict  what  is  in  the  CBRN  ISR  synchronization matrix. Examples of an ISR overlay can be found in appendix B. The CBRN ISR overlay augments the CBRN ISR plan in graphic form. Typical items depicted on the CBRN ISR overlay are— Friendly boundaries and phase lines.    CBRN reconnaissance handover lines.   CBRN NAIs and TAIs.   Limits of advance (LOA) and limits of reconnaissance (LOR). LOR are constraints derived from higher headquarters orders, which may designate LOA that impacts reconnaissance units.   Counterreconnaissance areas. Fire support control measures.    Graphics depicting the form of CBRN reconnaissance (zone, area, route).   Routes, start points, release points, infiltration lanes, and checkpoints.   Observation post locations (primary and alternate).  Sample transfer points, decontamination sites, ambulance exchange points, and logistic release points. Planned or existing obstacles.    Threat information (known hazard areas, danger areas).   Coverage areas for sensors.   UAS flight paths.   Retransmission locations.   Theater laboratory support locations. 2-11.  The CBRN ISR collection matrix is a CBRN ISR synchronization tool that links CBRN PIR to the commander’s lines of operation and/or decision points, links CBRN collection requirements to CBRN NAI and  CBRN  TAI,  provides  the  task/purpose  for  the  CBRN  collection  task,  and  provides  detailed  CBRN collection and reporting requirements. It is constructed in spreadsheet format and is comprised of individual worksheets, as required. Like the CBRN ISR synchronization matrix, the CBRN ISR collection matrix is 2-4 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 25 March 2013 Planning Activities not a tasking document and is not published as part of the base order. It is, however, a key tool that the CBRN officer, intelligence officer, and operations officer use in executing the CBRN ISR plan. CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR RECONNAISSANCE AND SURVEILLANCE PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS 2-12.  Guidance for the development of the CBRN ISR plan  are as follows:   Identify areas of interest for CBRN ISR. Identify and coordinate with organic, subordinate, and supporting CBRN R&S assets. Pre-position CBRN R&S assets to support requirements.    Assess the time and distance factors associated with movement formations and R&S techniques.   Orient  the  mission  execution  to  provide  timely  notification  of  critical  information  to  support tactical decisions.   Orient the CBRN R&S on the presence or absence of CBRN contamination in areas of interest.  Plan the resupply (logistic) activities to sustain CBRN R&S operations. Plan security to protect CBRN R&S assets.    Determine the rules of engagement (ROE) so that there is an understanding of the circumstances and limitations under which U.S. forces will initiate and/or continue combat engagement with other forces that are encountered. Plan  to  deploy  and  integrate  automatic  detection,  identification,  and  warning  systems  with individual  detection  and  identification  equipment.  Ensure  maximum coverage of critical areas with automatic systems. Rely on manual systems to expand or back up the coverage.    Use operational exposure guides (OEGs) to support radiological search and survey guidance.   Use military exposure guidelines to support chemical search and survey guidance.  Plan to use the data provided by the fielded detectors and the primary or additional CBRN staff to  determine  the  unit  status.  The  actual  presence  or  absence  of  contamination  should  be confirmed  by  multiple  detection  systems.  The  following  indicators  could  be  included  in  unit SOPs to determine the presence or absence of contamination:   Agent  symptoms  in  personnel  and  wildlife.  (Some  chemical  agents  manifest  themselves minutes to several hours after an attack; some biological agents manifest themselves several days or weeks after an attack.)   Tactics and weapon systems used in the attack. Suspicious clouds, vapors, powders, or liquids.  Intelligence  data  supporting  the  likely  or  actual  use  of  chemical-biological  agents  in  the joint operations area.    Reports from personnel, teams, and automatic systems.  Plan to request specialized assets (CBRN R&S teams, damage assessment and response teams, contamination  control  teams)  to  verify  initial  positive  indications,  identify  agents,  and  survey unmonitored areas.   Determine the possible locations for after-mission decontamination.   Use  the  radiological  OEGs  and  radiation  exposure  status  to  determine  protective  posture/risk mitigation steps for radiological threats/hazards and chemical military exposure guidelines and Technical Guide (TG)-230 to assess risk from chemical threats/hazards. Plan  to  establish  command  or  support  relationships  to  ensure  responsiveness  and  flexibility when using a supporting CBRN R&S element. Plan  for  logistics,  medical  support,  and  installation  protection  with  individual  and  collective protection.     Engage  public  health/preventive-medicine  assets  early  and  continuously  during  the  planning process. 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 2-5 Chapter 2 2-13.  For  additional  related  information  on  general  CBRN  staff  planning,  see  Multi-Service  Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Aspects of Command and Control.  2-14.  The  tactical  planning  for  CBRN  R&S  focuses  on  ensuring  that  CBRN  ISR  tasks  are  met.  The specific planning factors that are considered include ensuring that—   CBRN detection requirements are resourced (for example, operators are trained and tasked to operate CBRN detection systems). Sample collection techniques and procedures are rehearsed and understood.    A chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear warning and reporting system (CBRNWRS) is established and provides the required reports to higher, subordinate, and adjacent commands.   The sample evacuation process is rehearsed and understood.   CBRN detection resources are integrated into protection plans.   Analytical laboratory support is designated and the location is determined.   Available assets within the operational area, according to capability to complete ISR tasks, are determined.   Mission command/C2 of units and reporting procedures are established.   Orders are prepared. 2-15.  CBRN tactical R&S planning concentrates on—   Military operations.   Assets of the supporting units that are CBRN R&S capable. 2-16.  Each Service uses whatever method is normally used to plan its missions, determine acceptable risk, and make risk decisions. Risk management is an integral part of CBRN tactical R&S planning and is an integral part of the MDMP and troop leading procedures (TLP). The five steps of risk management fit into and support TLP and MDMP. CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR INTELLIGENCE, SURVEILLANCE, AND RECONNAISSANCE PLAN IMPLEMENTATION 2-17.  CBRN ISR tasks are used to produce mission statements for identified CBRN R&S assets. These mission  statements  are  used  as  a  basis  for  orders  (operation  orders  [OPORDs],  fragmentary  orders [FRAGORDs], warning orders [WARNORDs], mission taskings]) given to R&S assets to plan, prepare, and execute. 2-18.  Planning is critical for units that are CBRN R&S-capable, and there is seldom enough time to plan for every possible situation. There are, however, essential elements (the commander’s intent, a complete mission statement) that must be included in CBRN R&S orders. The CBRN R&S assets will use TLP to plan their R&S missions, identify required actions to be performed at the objective, and then plan backward to  the  departure  from  friendly  lines  and  forward  to  the  reentry  of  friendly  lines.  The  CBRN  R&S  asset leader will receive the orders from the supported unit. It is critical that the CBRN R&S asset leader fully understand the mission and situation. If the CBRN R&S asset leader has questions or concerns, he should get answers and conduct coordination while at the supported unit tactical operations center (TOC), where communications are good and key personnel are available. 2-19.  The CBRN R&S asset leader will coordinate directly and continuously with the supported unit staff throughout the planning and preparation phases. Mission coordination must be thorough and detailed since the CBRN R&S asset could be operating semi-independently, forward of friendly units, and beyond direct fires. Additionally, the CBRN R&S asset leader must coordinate with those units in whose area the CBRN R&S asset will move and operate. Items to coordinate with the supported unit include—   Changes and updates in the adversary and friendly situations.   The best use of terrain for routes, rally points, and forward reconnaissance bases.   Light and weather data. 2-6 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 25 March 2013 Planning Activities Sample transfer points and field/theater laboratory locations/support.   Decontamination sites and linkup.    The availability of an element to provide local/overwatch security.   Mission-oriented protective posture (MOPP) level for supporting elements.   The use and location of landing zones (LZs).   The departure and reentry of friendly lines.    Rehearsal areas and times.    Health service support (HSS), including medical evacuation.   Logistic support (packaging, transportation, disposal of sample collection and decontamination Fires on the objective and along the planned routes, including alternate routes. Special equipment requirements. waste). Signal plan call signs, frequencies, code words, pyrotechnics, challenges, and passwords. Identification procedures to reduce the incidence of friendly fire.   2-20.  The CBRN R&S asset leader should consider the following:   Essential and supporting tasks. Ensure that the essential tasks are assigned on the objective, at danger areas, at security or surveillance locations, along routes, and during the passage of lines.   Key travel and execution times. Estimate the time requirements for moving to the objective, reconnoitering  the  objective,  establishing  security  and  surveillance,  completing  assigned  tasks while  on  the  objective,  moving  to  and  through  friendly  lines,  and  conducting  operational debriefings.   Primary and alternate routes. Select primary and alternate routes to and from the objective.  Signals.  Consider  using  special  signals  (hand-and-arm  signals,  flares,  voice,  whistles,  radios, infrared equipment). Communication is key to successful R&S operations. 2-21.  The threat environment must be considered when planning a CBRN R&S mission. In uncertain and permissive  environments,  the  CBRN  R&S  asset  must  consider  hazards  (mines,  improvised  explosive devices  [IEDs])  when  executing  R&S  missions.  The  possible  types  of  CBRN  hazards  that  may  be encountered must be known. However, the CBRN R&S asset must be prepared for the unexpected. This allows  the  CBRN  R&S  asset  to  determine  what IPE; PPE;  and detection,  monitoring,  and  identification devices are needed to operate safely while conducting the mission. 2-22.  CBRN R&S asset leaders use TLP to integrate activities during planning and, when required, during preparation  and  execution.  The  TLP  are  a  sequence  of  actions  that  help  CBRN  R&S  asset  leaders  to effectively and efficiently use available time to issue orders and execute tactical operations. It begins with the alert of a new mission; and for the CBRN R&S asset leader, time will dictate the amount of detail put into each step. TLP are not a hard and fast set of rules. They are a guide that must be applied consistent with the situation and the experience of the CBRN R&S asset leader and his subordinate leaders. The tasks involved  in  some  steps  (initiate  movement,  issue  the  WARNORD,  conduct  reconnaissance)  may  recur several times during the process. The last step, those activities associated with supervising and refining the plan, occur throughout troop leading. For more information on TLP, see Multi-Service Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Aspects of Command and Control. SUMMARY 2-23.  This chapter outlines planning considerations for CBRN R&S operations. The tactical commander and the CBRN staff plan for CBRN R&S with personnel and equipment capable of performing the necessary tasks. Chapter 3 discusses the preparation activities required to conduct CBRN R&S activities at the tactical level. Although TLP were briefly discussed in this chapter, TLP continue while preparing for CBRN R&S operations and will be further discussed in chapter 3. 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 2-7 This page intentionally left blank.    Chapter 3 Preparation Activities This chapter provides CBRN R&S preparation activities at the staff and R&S asset levels.  CBRN  R&S  preparation  includes  those  activities  undertaken  by  the  R&S element before mission execution to improve their ability to conduct the operation. CBRN  R&S  preparation  may  include  CBRN  ISR  plan  refinement,  rehearsals, reconnaissance, coordination, inspections, and movement.  PREPARATION 3-1.  Planning and preparation overlap to ensure effective time management and synchronized efforts. As leaders plan missions, R&S elements and personnel prepare. CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR RECONNAISSANCE AND SURVEILLANCE MISSION PREPARATION 3-2.  The  nature  of  CBRN  R&S  operations  differs  tremendously  from  situation  to  situation.  It  requires various staff, unit, and personnel actions for each unique mission. CBRN R&S preparation begins when the WARNORD is delivered by the staff and received by the R&S asset. Preparation for CBRN R&S missions includes the following:   Command and staff. Command and staff perform the following tasks:   Update and refine products developed during planning.   Update the CBRN COP (including the visualization of the operational environment and the CBRN  threats  and  hazards  based  on  new  information  gathered  through  collection  and friendly reporting). Issue orders to officially task the CBRN R&S element. Issue FRAGORDs to adjust the plan as necessary.     Receive backbriefs.   Approve CBRN R&S element plans.   R&S assets. R&S assets perform the following tasks:   Conduct TLP to include mission and task analysis.   Task organize.   Conduct  coordination  and  liaison  with  supported  and  supporting  units  (for  example, decontamination units, sample transfers, and convoy commanders). Feed military personnel.   Conduct precombat checks. Select appropriate IPE/PPE.    Maintain and inspect equipment.   Distribute supplies.    Rest.   Coordinate premission health screening.   Use camouflage.   Distribute individual medical countermeasures as necessary.   Conduct rehearsals and drills. 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 3-1 Chapter 3   Conduct backbriefs.   Conduct training.   Conduct movement and linkup as required.   Conduct reconnaissance and terrain analysis relative to the mission.   Conduct security force coordination. PREPARATION CONSIDERATIONS 3-3.  The  early  movement  of  military  units,  personnel,  and  equipment  to  support  mission  requirements will occur during the preparation phase. Staffs continually update and validate their commander’s intent as they  receive  intelligence  based  on  the  results  of  ISR  operations  and  friendly  information  from  reports. Significant new information requires commanders to make one of the following assessments:   The new information validates the plan with no further changes.   The new information requires adjusting the plan.   The new information invalidates the plan. 3-4.  Movement  control  includes  planning,  routing,  scheduling,  and  controlling  personnel  and  materiel movements into, within, and out of an operational area. Maintaining movement control, keeping lines of communication  open,  managing  reception  and  transshipment  points,  and  obtaining  host  nation  (HN) support are critical to CBRN tactical R&S operations. Prior to any mission, the unit designated as a CBRN R&S capability must receive a detailed IPOE/IPB of the operational area from supported headquarters. This information is part of the mission analysis during TLP (discussed in chapter 2). The section/team leader must determine the probability of contact and where that contact will most likely occur. To do this, they use information from the intelligence staff, sensor reports, and information collected by tactical patrols. The section/team leader is then able to plan for contact and determine how to employ TTP (proper movement techniques  to  reduce  the  occurrence  of  chance  contact,  sample  collection  techniques  for  suspect  CBRN contamination). 3-5.  Each staff section and element conducts activities to maximize the operational effectiveness of the force. Coordination between echelons (and the preparation that precedes execution) are just as important, if not  more  important,  than  plan  development.  Staff  preparation  includes  assembling  and  continuously updating estimates. 3-6.  Unit CBRN R&S capabilities must prepare to begin operations immediately after an attack, or they may  delay  operations  to  avoid  or  reduce  exposure  to  potential  CBRN  hazard.  Specialized  CBRN  R&S teams  may  be  directed  to  start  operations  immediately  after  an  incident  or  upon  locating  a  suspected hazardous  area/location  to  provide  commanders  with  a  quick  assessment  of  the  status  and  the  overall situation. Unit CBRN R&S teams and individuals generally do not begin operations until directed by their higher headquarters. They must be prepared for short-notice mission assignments in a high CBRN threat environment. 3-7.  CBRN  R&S  assets  prepare  for  CBRN  R&S  operations  as  a  foundation  for  the  conduct  of  other military  operations.  A  CBRN  R&S  element  must  readily  adapt  to  multiple  transitions  between  offense, defense, stability, or civil support operations. 3-8.  CBRN R&S asset preparation is a continuous process. Even in the absence of a given mission, the CBRN element focuses on maintaining continued readiness and preparation by conducting—   Equipment maintenance. Personnel/team training.    Area studies. 3-9.  The CBRN R&S asset conducts precombat checks/precombat inspections (PCCs/PCIs) and readies equipment  and  personnel  for  the  upcoming  mission.  Orders  must  thoroughly  cover  the  aspects  of  the operations  (including  possible  adversary  COAs  to  reduce  reaction  time).  The  CBRN  R&S  assets  must know friendly information (location of friendly obstacles, location of designated passage points and lanes, recognition signals, location of the counterreconnaissance screen). 3-2 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 25 March 2013 Preparation Activities 3-10.  The need for close coordination with the supported unit is critical in the preparation phase. CBRN R&S assets operating forward of the supported unit’s defensive positions must understand the scheme for screening  force  to  reduce  the  possibility  of  friendly  fire.  The  CBRN  R&S  capability  must  coordinate movements in the  main defensive area to prevent losses to friendly  minefields, obstacles, and screening force efforts. The leader of the CBRN R&S asset should obtain a copy of the fire support overlay before departure or coordinate with the fire support officer to use the existing target information reference system to adjust fire. 3-11.  CBRN  R&S  assets  must  implement  effective  quality  management  practices  so  that  their  systems, processes,  and  analytical  tests  are  functioning  properly.  The  omission  of  any  aspect  of  the  quality management program decreases the overall quality of the analytical result. A quality management program can include ensuring that—    Proper  operator  training  and  certification  are  performed  to  maintain  knowledgeable,  skilled operators  and  technicians  to  perform  the  analysis.  Documentation  of  initial  and  continuing training for all operators of the system or process must be maintained. Proficiency of each operator is  maintained through the periodic analysis of unknown samples (such  as  proficiency  tests).  The  results  must  be  verified  and  documented  by  a  supervisor  or designated  observer  who  attests  to  the  accuracy  of  the  analysis  and  adherence  to  the  proper analytical process. Preventive maintenance checks and services (PMCS)/planned maintenance system (PMS–Navy) on  equipment  and  instruments  are  conducted  on  a  routine  basis  as  recommended  by  the equipment  operating  manual.  The  documentation  of  PMCS  performance  and  the  problems corrected must be maintained.   Critical reagents and controls are transported and stored in the proper environment as directed by the manufacturer. Positive and negative controls are performed and the results are obtained and documented.    Management  and  supervisory  personnel  maintain  awareness  of  potential  errors  and  problems with the system or process, evaluate personnel and processes, document errors or problems, and take corrective action to eliminate or minimize errors or problems. ASSESSMENT 3-12.  Assessment continues during the preparation phase of a mission. It includes assessing the progress of preparation  and  the  evaluation  of  the  readiness  and  ability  of  the  element  to  conduct  its  given  missions against the criteria of success. CBRN R&S asset leaders assess their unit’s progress by comparing it with the commander’s intent and adjusting their actions to achieve the envisioned end state, particularly in the absence  of  orders.  Assessment  activities  also  include  assessing  the  readiness  of  subordinate  unit  CBRN R&S capabilities. 3-13.  When preparing for CBRN R&S missions, it is important to ensure that CBRN R&S elements assess their  communications  capabilities  so  that  they  can  communicate  with  each  other  and, more  importantly, report  the  results  of  their  R&S  activities  to  their  supported  unit.  CBRN  information  is  critical  to  the commander’s  decisionmaking  in  a  CBRN  operational  environment.  A  CBRN  R&S  element  must  be prepared to communicate at all times. Note.

SUMMARY 3-14.  The key focus of this chapter is to address CBRN R&S tasks and considerations while preparing for a CBRN R&S mission.

Chapter  4  discusses  the  execution activities required to conduct CBRN tactical R&S activities. 3-4 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 25 March 2013  Chapter 4 Execution Activities Chapter  4  provides  an  overview  of  CBRN  ISR  forms,  modes,  methods,  tasks,  and techniques used to conduct CBRN R&S operations. When conducting CBRN R&S missions, multiple variations of these elements (forms, modes, methods, and CBRN ISR  tasks  and  techniques)  can  be  used.  CBRN  R&S  leaders  plan  their  missions around  these  elements. There  is  no  standard  set  or  combination  that  must  be  used. CBRN  R&S  leaders  incorporate  METT-TC/METT-T  during  the  planning  and execution of their assigned CBRN R&S missions to determine their best COA at any given time. Specific guidance and acceptable risk are also factors that affect CBRN R&S mission execution. The commander considers the factors of METT-TC/METT-T  to  determine  whether  to  conduct  mounted,  dismounted,  or  aerial  CBRN  R&S. Conditions  that  may  result  in  a  decision  to  conduct  certain  forms  of  CBRN  R&S include terrain, environmental conditions, size of the area/location, and whether the area/location or route is secure and/or clear. level  of  detail  required,  available  assets,  IPOE/IPB, time, CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR RECONNAISSANCE AND SURVEILLANCE FORMS 4-1.  Figure 4-1, page 4-2, shows the forms of CBRN  reconnaissance (route, zone, and area) and three forms of CBRN surveillance (area, point, and medical). Descriptions of these forms can be found in chapter 1. CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR RECONNAISSANCE AND SURVEILLANCE MODES 4-2.  There are three modes associated with CBRN R&S. They are discussed in the following paragraphs. MOUNTED 4-3.  Mounted  CBRN  R&S  operations  are usually  performed  to  minimize  the  exposure  of  personnel  to CBRN  threats/hazards.  Many  of  these  vehicles  provide  additional  protection  from  CBRN  hazards  using shielding  and  onboard  air  filtration  systems.  See  Multi-Service  Tactics,  Techniques,  and  Procedures  for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Aspects of Command and Control for further descriptions of  these  assets  and  unit  designations.  The  conduct  of  mounted  CBRN  R&S  tasks  also  allows  for  larger areas/locations  to  be  covered  over  a  shorter  period of  time  than  dismounted  forms  of  CBRN  R&S.  See appendix D for further information on mounted CBRN R&S. DISMOUNTED 4-4.  Dismounted  CBRN  R&S  operations  are  conducted  mainly  by  foot,  with  limited  vehicle  support. They normally require more time than mounted R&S operations. The following conditions may result in the commander directing a dismounted CBRN R&S mission:   Time is available.   Detailed CBRN R&S is required.  Stealth is required. 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 4-1 Chapter 4   The IPOE/IPB process indicates close proximity to adversary positions.   The CBRN R&S element encounters danger areas.   Urban environments and restrictive terrain limits the effectiveness of mounted reconnaissance.   Confined spaces and/or areas/locations.

See appendix E for further information on dismounted CBRN R&S. AERIAL  4-6.  Typically,  aerial  CBRN  R&S  operations  are  conducted  during  radiological  surveys.  Aerial  R&S operations  can  cover  a  much  larger  area  in  a  shorter  period  than  ground  mounted  and  dismounted operations. It provides added CBRN protection to military personnel by using distance to take readings that can be converted to actual ground readings using an air-ground correlation factor. (See appendix F for more information on aerial CBRN R&S.) 4-2 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 25 March 2013 CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR RECONNAISSANCE AND SURVEILLANCE METHODS 4-7.  The following are the methods used when conducting CBRN R&S— Execution Activities  Standoff.  During  surveillance  operations  the  standoff  method  is  conducted  to  provide  early warning, tracking and in some cases, identification of a CBRN hazard. During reconnaissance operations, the standoff method is conducted to assist in locating and confirming the presence of a CBRN hazard. Stationary standoff detection can be performed for chemical, biological, and radiological  (CBR)  threats/hazards.  Standoff  is  used  to  detect  CBRN  threats/hazards  by observing a CBRN NAI from a safe distance. The observer is not on the target, but at a distance away from the target allowed by his detection method. Also, certain CBRN standoff detectors can be operated on the move. The difference between standoff and remote is the location of the detector  relative  to  the  receiver  (which  can  be  a  person  or  technology).  (See  appendix  G  for more information on standoff R&S.)   Remote. Remote CBRN R&S operations are usually performed from a distant location through a communication link to a CBRN detector or monitor. These devices are normally designed to be recoverable.  Current  remote  operations  use  detectors  and  monitors  at  stationary  locations. Emerging technologies allow remote CBRN detectors and monitors to be remotely operated on mobile platforms such as UASs, unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), and robots. (See appendix G for more information on remote CBRN R&S.)   Direct.  Direct  monitoring  is  the  simplest,  most  precise  monitoring  technique.  The  CBRN monitor is used to get an unshielded (outside) reading of the suspected hazard. Direct readings are used when conditions and risk are acceptable. Direct monitoring is used—   While monitoring for the initial detection or arrival of fallout.   When in low dose rate areas/locations.   When  determining  unshielded  (outside)  ground  dose  rates  for  transmission  or  correlation factors.    When verifying the contamination status of a new position.   While moving through a contaminated area on foot. Indirect. Indirect CBRN monitoring, detection, identification, and sample collection occur when the CBRN device is not used at the source of the CBRN hazards. Indirect monitoring can be used by an R&S element to measure radiation levels when dose rates are high enough to be read inside a shielded location. It lowers the risk of exposure to personnel. An example of an indirect reading is when a radiological dose rate reading is taken while inside a bunker. This reading is converted  using  the  correlation  factor  of  the  bunker  to  determine  the  outside  intensity  of  the radiation. Another example is when a device is used that can look into a container and identify the agent inside without having to open the container. Such devices use various methods, such as X-ray spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy, to do this. 4-8.  Indirect radiological dose rate readings are taken at known distances from a radiological source. The actual radiation intensity at the source is calculated using the inverse square law that applies to radiation. For  further  details  see  the  Multi-Service  Tactics,  Techniques,  and  Procedures  for  Chemical,  Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Contamination Avoidance. CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR RECONNAISSANCE AND SURVEILLANCE TASKS 4-9.  CBRN R&S tasks were briefly introduced in chapter 1. Below are the tasks and their descriptions. CBRN R&S tasks make up the core of CBRN R&S missions. CBRN R&S missions can be broken down into  a  set  of  these  tasks.  Not  all  missions  will  include  these  tasks.  Examples  would  be  a  CBRN reconnaissance  operation  that  does  not  include  the  “collect  environmental  samples”  task  or  a  CBRN surveillance mission that does not require the CBRN hazard to be quantified. 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 4-3 Chapter 4 CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR RECONNAISSANCE TASKS 4-10.  The CBRN reconnaissance tasks are—   Detect chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear hazards. Detecting CBRN hazards is described as determining the presence of a CBRN hazard in the environment.    Locate chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear hazards.  Locating  CBRN hazards  is described  as  finding  the  place  where  the  CBRN  hazard  exists.  To  locate  CBRN  hazards,  the zigzag, lane, cloverleaf, or grid techniques can be used. Further details on these techniques are provided later in this chapter. Identify chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear hazards. Identifying CBRN hazards is  described  as  determining  the  specific  CBRN  hazard  present  in  the  environment.    The identification  levels  are  presumptive,  field  confirmatory,  theater  validation,  and  definitive. Further details on CBRN identification levels can be found in chapter 5.     Quantify chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear hazards. Quantifying CBRN hazards is described as determining the amount of the specific CBRN hazard present in the environment.   Collect  chemical,  biological,  radiological,  and  nuclear  samples.  Collecting  environmental CBRN  samples  is  described  as  obtaining  a  representative  amount  of  the  CBRN  hazard  for subsequent analysis later. Environmental samples include air, water, soil, and vegetation. They can include liquids, solids, or vapors. They do not include clinical/medical specimens. Further details on sample collection can be found in chapter 6 and appendix H. Survey chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear hazards. Surveying CBRN hazards is described as the active effort to determine the extent of contamination of CBRN hazards. When conducting  a  CBRN  survey  the  nearside-farside,  box,  star,  bounce  and  bypass,  course  leg,  or preselected dose rate techniques can be used. Further details on these techniques are provided later in this chapter.    Mark  chemical,  biological,  radiological,  and  nuclear  hazards.  Marking  CBRN  hazards  is described as the use of visual or other indicators to warn others of the presence of a CBRN agent in a particular area/location. When marking a CBRN hazard, hasty or deliberate techniques are used. Further details on these techniques are provided later in this chapter.   Report  chemical,  biological,  radiological,  and  nuclear  hazards.  Reporting  is  described  as providing relevant information about the CBRN hazard and other related data. The commander’s IRs drive CBRN R&S. Reporting information derived from CBRN R&S provides answers to the commander’s  IRs.  Reporting  must  be  timely,  accurate,  and  as  complete  as  possible  to  ensure effective  and  informed  operational  decisionmaking  and  to  support  medical  assessment  and surveillance determinations. CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR SURVEILLANCE TASKS 4-11.  The CBRN surveillance tasks are—   Monitor chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear hazards. Monitoring CBRN hazards is  described  as  checking  the  environment  using  passive  measures  for  the  presence  of  CBRN hazards.  When  monitoring  for  CBRN  hazards,  periodic  or  continuous  techniques  are  used. Further details on these techniques are provided later in this chapter.   Observe chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear hazards. Observing CBRN hazards is described as watching a specific location to determine the potential for the presence of a CBRN hazard using visual means.    Detect chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear hazards. Detecting CBRN hazards is described as determining the presence of a CBRN hazard in the environment. The critical node and area array techniques are used when conducting CBRN surveillance. Further details on these techniques are provided later in this chapter. Identify chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear hazards. Identifying CBRN hazards is described as determining the specific CBRN hazard present in the environment. There are four identification levels—presumptive, field confirmatory, theater validation, and definitive. Further details on CBRN identification levels can be found in chapter 5.  4-4 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 25 March 2013 Execution Activities   Quantify chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear hazards. Quantifying CBRN hazards is described as determining the amount of the specific CBRN hazard present in the environment.   Collect chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear samples. Collecting CBRN samples is described  as  obtaining  a  representative  amount  of  the  CBRN  hazard  for  subsequent  analysis later. Environmental samples include air, water, soil, and vegetation. They can include liquids, solids,  or  vapors.  They  do  not  include  clinical/medical  specimens.  Further  details  on  sample collection can be found in chapter 6 and appendix H.   Report chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear hazards. Reporting CBRN hazards is described as providing relevant information about the CBRN hazard and other related data. The commander’s IRs drive CBRN R&S. Reporting information derived from CBRN R&S provides answers to the commander’s IRs. Reporting must be timely and accurate to ensure effective and informed decisionmaking. CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR RECONNAISSANCE AND SURVEILLANCE TECHNIQUES 4-12.  CBRN  R&S  techniques  are  briefly  introduced  in  this  chapter.  Further  discussions  of  CBRN techniques are discussed in appendixes D, E, F, and G. CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR RECONNAISSANCE TECHNIQUES 4-13.  The CBRN reconnaissance techniques are—   Zigzag.  The  zigzag  CBRN  reconnaissance  technique  is  used  to  locate  contamination  areas during route, zone, and area reconnaissance missions. The zigzag technique involves many turns, and a high level of maneuverability is required when conducting this technique. (See appendixes D and E for further details.)   Lane. The lane CBRN reconnaissance technique is used to locate contamination areas during route, zone, and area reconnaissance missions. The lane technique traverses an area, periodically probing for contamination. It delivers a very detailed coverage of an area in a short period. (See appendixes D and E for further details.)   Cloverleaf.  The  cloverleaf  CBRN  reconnaissance  technique  is  used  during  mounted  and dismounted  operations.  The  R&S  element  moves  in  a  cloverleaf  pattern,  with  each  leaf extending 50 to 200 meters from the starting point. This technique is not used in radiological contaminated areas due to the lack of shielding. (See appendixes D and E for further details.)   Grid. The grid CBRN reconnaissance technique is employed by R&S elements where speed and accuracy are important. It is employed by superimposing a grid over the R&S element  maps, which enables them to rapidly communicate locations of contaminants, location of samples were collected, locations of casualties, and other pertinent information. (See appendixes D and E.)   Triangulation.  The  triangulation  CBRN  reconnaissance  technique  is  employed  by  R&S elements to locate radiological contamination sources while dismounted. (See appendix E.)   Nearside-farside. The nearside-farside survey technique is normally used by an R&S element to determine the beginning and end of contamination along a route. (See appendixes D and E.)   Box. The box survey technique is used to determine the general dimensions (length and width) of a contaminated area. It is best employed by three teams, and the process starts once a team enters the contaminated area. (See appendixes D and E.) Star.  The  star  survey  technique  is  a  very  quick  way  to  determine  the  rough  limits  of  a contaminated area. (See appendixes D and E.)    Bounce and bypass. The bounce and bypass technique is used to locate the general boundaries of a contaminated area. (See appendixes D and E.)   Course leg. The course leg technique is used to conduct an aerial reconnaissance survey mission to  define  the  extent  of  a  radiological  hazard.  The  pilot  flies  a  straight  line  between  two checkpoints  (for  example,  from  Point  A  [top  of  a  hill]  to  Point  B  [top  of  another  hill]).  The aircraft only lands to obtain the air-ground correlation factor data. 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 4-5 Chapter 4   Preselected dose rate. The preselected dose rate technique is used to determine the boundaries of radiological contamination while limiting and controlling exposure to R&S elements. Useful in surveying the presence of residual radiological contamination and neutron-induced radiation, this  technique  also  permits  the  R&S  element  to  avoid  excessive  radioactive  hazard  levels  by assigning  specific  dose rates  to be  surveyed from  outside  the hazard  toward  the  center of  the attack/incident area or location.    Hasty  marking.  The  hasty  marking  technique  is  used  when  initial  marking  must  be  rapid, providing only the bare minimum signature needed to safely pass small units through or around CBRN hazards. (See appendix I.)   Deliberate marking. The  deliberate  marking  technique is  used  for  larger  units  (battalion  and above) that may require improved lanes to accommodate two-way traffic. (See appendix I.) CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR SURVEILLANCE TECHNIQUES 4-14.  The CBRN surveillance techniques are—   Periodic.  The  periodic  CBRN  monitoring  technique  during  CBRN  surveillance  missions consists of frequent checks of the environment for the arrival or presence of CBRN hazards.   Continuous. The continuous monitoring technique during CBRN surveillance missions involves uninterrupted checking for CBRN hazards at a given location over a specified period of time.   Critical  node.  The  critical-node  technique  uses  a  set  of  detectors  and/or  monitors  positioned around and throughout a specific high-value target to provide for the detection and early warning of  a  CBRN  attack.  Examples  of  such  are  aerial  port  of  debarkation,  seaport  of  debarkation (SPOD), and mission command/C2 locations.   Area array. The area array technique uses a set of CBRN detectors and/or monitors positioned within a given geographic space to provide for detection and early warning of a CBRN incident. They  are  positioned  to  complement  and  overlap  each  other  in  such  a  way  as  to  increase  the probability of detection of a CBRN hazard. CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR RECONNAISSANCE AND SURVEILLANCE CONSIDERATIONS 4-15.  A key factor in CBRN R&S execution is the time available to conduct the mission. The commander must recognize increased risk to the CBRN R&S element and the main body when he accelerates the pace of CBRN R&S. This risk can be somewhat offset by employing aerial reconnaissance and technical means to cover open terrain or areas of lower threat. 4-16.  The  following  weather,  terrain,  and  light  conditions  impact  the  effectiveness  of  CBRN  R&S capabilities and drive employment considerations:   Battlespace obscuration, fog, rain, and snow result in reduced visibility. Generally, CBRN R&S during  limited-visibility  conditions  takes  more  time.  However,  these  conditions  provide  for better  stealth  and  enhance  the  survivability  of  CBRN  R&S  assets.  A  commander  frequently employs  dismounted  CBRN  R&S  patrols  at  night.  These  patrols  use  light  amplification  and thermal  observation  devices,  electronic  surveillance  devices,  and  surveillance  radars  to compensate for reduced visibility conditions.   High winds, extreme temperatures, and loose topsoil or sand may adversely affect aerial CBRN R&S. Aerial reconnaissance assets plan their missions in much the same way as ground units. They  use  the  same  type  of  operational  graphics  and  consider  the  same  critical  tasks.  The  air reconnaissance commander organizes the assets to accomplish the mission by considering the same  IPOE/IPB  aspects  as  those  associated  with  ground  forces.  He  focuses  on  air  hazards  to navigation and anticipated adversary air defense capabilities. In limited visibility, mounted CBRN R&S tends to focus on road networks. The adversary can detect  engine  and  track  movement  noises  of  friendly  mounted  CBRN  R&S  elements  at considerable distances at night, which makes them susceptible to ambush. Strict noise and light discipline,  along  with  masking  sounds  such  as  artillery  fires,  help  keep  a  mounted reconnaissance force from being compromised or ambushed.  4-6 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 25 March 2013 Execution Activities 4-17.  No  single  CBRN  R&S  capability  can  answer  every  intelligence  requirement,  and  there  are  rarely enough CBRN R&S assets to cover every mission requirement.  4-18.  Units and systems performing CBRN R&S are vulnerable to detection, engagement, and destruction by  the  adversary.  When  this  occurs  and  the  CBRN  R&S  capability  can  no  longer  perform  its  primary mission, the commander must determine whether to reconstitute by regenerating or reorganizing the unit. SUMMARY 4-19.  This  chapter provides  an overview  of  CBRN  R&S,  forms,  modes,  methods,  tasks,  and  techniques used throughout CBRN R&S operations. Detailed descriptions can be found in the appendixes. The end state of CBRN R&S is the production of usable information that supports the commander’s IRs. As part of the commander’s IRs, samples may be obtained during CBRN R&S that will further provide information once analyzed and identified. Chapter 5 addresses the identification levels.   25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 4-7 This page intentionally left blank.    Chapter 5 Identification Levels The  purpose  of  CBRN  R&S  operations  is  to  provide  decisionmakers  with  critical information concerning the area/location and identity of suspected CBRN hazards to allow  them  to  establish  and  update  CBRN  protection  requirements.  This  chapter provides  details  on  the  new  DOD  four-tier  system  for  determining  the  identity  of CBRN  hazards.  The  new  four levels  are—presumptive,  field confirmatory, theater validation, and definitive. This publication is the proponent for doctrinal  definitions  of  these  four  identification  levels.  Forward-deployed  Navy medical  assets  (including the  forward  deployable  preventive-medicine  units [FDPMUs])  and  those  aboard  aircraft  carriers  (nuclear)  amphibious  assault  ships (general  purpose),  and  amphibious  assault  ships  (multipurpose),  will  continue  to operate  within  a  three-tiered  system  and  conduct  field  confirmatory  and  theater validation level analyses on suspected biological warfare materials within the same laboratories. The FDPMUs are likewise equipped to conduct field confirmatory and theater  validation  level  analyses  on  7  chemical  warfare  (CW)  agents  and  over  130 toxic  industrial  chemicals  (TICs)  that  pose  environmental  health  threats.  These facilities participate in monthly or bimonthly quality assurance (QA) and proficiency testing  and  have  24-7  subject  matter  expert  (SME)  reachback  support.  When suspicious  incidents  occur  that  may  involve  the  use  of  CBRN  agents  against  U.S., allied,  or  coalition  forces,  verification  through  CBRN  R&S  operations—combined with  samples  from  the  field,  their  history,  and  the  results  from  the  analytical laboratories—may  provide  irrefutable  evidence  to  senior  leaders  that  an  attack  has occurred.  Evidence  must  be  scientifically  valid,  and  any  samples  must  have  a documented  chain  of  custody  from  the  point  of  collection  to  presentation.  General military  application/decision  scenarios form  of  CBRN identification  are  also  described  within  this  chapter.  These  scenarios  establish  the framework  upon  which  identification  levels  are  derived.  This  manual  focuses  on decisions  at  two  levels—tactical  and  operational.  However,  to  be  fully  inclusive, there is also a brief discussion on strategic, CBRN-related decisions. require  some identification that TACTICAL DECISIONS 5-1.  At the tactical level, decisions include, but are not limited to—   Detect to warn. Used when detecting for chemical aerosols or radiological fallout. The decision to warn is based on the assumption that there is a threat of an upwind aerosol or fallout cloud moving toward the warned forces. It also can be a notification that exposure may have already occurred. A warning should be accompanied by treatment and/or protection guidance to ensure a consistent, effective response when possible. This type of warning is normally sent via a CBRN1 report.   Contamination avoidance.   Appropriate personal protection level. Ensure that forces are in the appropriate level of personal protection (for example, MOPP4).   Additional information. Obtain additional information to support the concept of operations and scheme of maneuver.  25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 5-1 Chapter 5 OPERATIONAL DECISIONS 5-2.  At  the  operational  level,  CBRN-related  decisions  are  primarily  a  follow-up  to  tactical  decisions and/or are used to determine/verify hazard mitigation during ongoing deployment operations. At this level, impacted decisions include, but are not limited to—   Verification of hazard reduction so that troops can reduce or eliminate MOPP level.   Detect to treat. The decision to administer postexposure medical countermeasures or treatment is made  after  there  is  evidence  of  likely  detection  of,  or  exposure  to,  a  CBRN  agent.  The commander makes the decision to treat and warn with advice from the command surgeon and supporting  input  from  the  CBRN  officer  and  intelligence  staff.  The  command  surgeon  will recommend  the  appropriate  medical  countermeasures  or  treatment  regimen.  The  message  to begin treatment is sent using very specific information as to what medical countermeasures to use, how much to administer treatment, and who should receive this treatment. The message is normally sent via medical channels, but CBRN staff should also be kept informed at all levels.  Positive identification. Forensics (for evidence and attribution).   STRATEGIC DECISIONS 5-3.  At  the  strategic  level,  CBRN  analytical  results  have  an  impact  on  decisions  related  to  national strategic direction and integration. At this level, applications and decisions include, but are not limited to—  Intelligence collection. Forensics (for evidence and attribution).    Continuous  monitoring/surveillance  of  deployed  bases  for  emerging  or  routine  environmental hazards (for example, certain TICs from local industrial emissions) so that deployment health exposures are documented.   Meeting decontamination verification/clearance requirements. CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR IDENTIFICATION IMPLICATIONS  5-4.  As introduced previously, the specific decision required is the primary factor determining the level of CBRN  identification  required  on  a  sample.  Additional  factors  also  potentially  influencing  the  command staff as they determine the types and numbers of samples required and the level of CBRN analysis needed on each sample include—   Higher  identification  levels  that  require  support  from  low-density,  highly  trained,  specialized units.    Higher identification levels that  require more time to complete.   The command/support relationship with supported and supporting units.   CBRNWRS protocols.   The type of CBRN reconnaissance and/or surveillance mission that will be performed to equip the R&S element with the right detection and identification devices.   Logistics support, sample transfer, and escort requirements.    Collection management plan maintenance. Follow-on CBRN R&S missions. 5-5.  When there is a need to identify possible treaty violations, the collection of evidence and the analysis of  samples  may  require  protocols  that  can  withstand  international  scrutiny—procedures  that  establish  a “forensic trail.” Although such evidence is required quickly, the proof of use of these agents must be so that it cannot be refuted. 5-2 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 25 March 2013 Identification Levels IDENTIFICATION LEVELS 5-6.  Through  METT-TC/METT-T  and  the  CCIR,  staff  personnel  plan  for  the  capabilities  needed  to achieve the appropriate level of identification. This information is fed back into the collection management plan to prepare for and execute sample collection operations (see chapter 6) of the CBRN hazard detected and identified by the CBRN R&S capability. 5-7.  The higher the level of identification completed on a CBRN hazard—the higher the confidence the commander has that a CBRN attack or incident has occurred. Samples may not require analysis at all four identification levels. An example of this is a presumptively identified biological sample sent directly to a theater validation laboratory. An overview of the identification levels is provided in figure 5-1.  Legend: DOD Department of DefenseFigure 5-1. Overview of CBRN identification levels Notes. 1. Samples may not require analysis at all identification levels, depending on the agent and the decisions and actions taken after identification. 2. In figure 5-1, technical forces are specially trained and equipped forces that possess a higher degree of CBRN detection and sampling capability compared to general-purpose forces.   PRESUMPTIVE IDENTIFICATION 5-8.  Presumptive  identification  is  the  employment  of  technologies  with  limited  specificity  and sensitivity by general-purpose forces in a field environment to determine the presence of a chemical, biological,  radiological,  and/or  nuclear  hazard  with  a  low  level  of  confidence  and  the  degree  of certainty necessary to support immediate tactical decisions.  5-9.  Presumptive  identification  is  obtained  using  commonly  fielded  devices/materials/technologies available to general-purpose forces to indicate/warn of the possible presence of a CBRN/target substance. It provides  important  information  to  support  warning  decisions  and  actions,  such  as  taking  avoidance, protection, and decontamination measures. Table 5-1, page 5-4, provides further presumptive identification descriptors.   25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 5-3 Chapter 5 Who Where Capabilities Chemical Biological Radiological Chemical Biological Radiological Chemical Biological Radiological Chemical Why Biological Radiological Chemical Sample actions Biological Radiological Table 5-1.

Field  confirmatory  identification  is  the  employment  of  technologies  with  increased  specificity and sensitivity by technical forces in a field environment to identify chemical, biological, radiological, and/or nuclear hazards with a moderate level of confidence and the degree of certainty necessary to support follow-on tactical decisions.  5-11.  Field  confirmatory  identification  is  obtained  using  fielded  devices/materials/technologies  that  are available  to  specially  trained  personnel  and  units  in  a  field  environment  that  includes  collection  and analyses  of  samples  to  substantiate  the  presence  and  type  of  a  CBRN/target  substance  at  a  given area/location.  Field  confirmatory  identification  can be  used  to  prove  (or  disprove) previous  presumptive results. It results in higher confidence levels to support tactical decisions regarding avoidance, protection, and  decontamination  measures  and  immediate  treatment.

Theater  validation  identification  is  the  employment  of  multiple  independent,  established protocols  and  technologies  by  scientific  experts  in  the  controlled  environment  of  a  fixed  or mobile/transportable laboratory to characterize a chemical, biological, radiological, and/or nuclear hazard with a high level of confidence and the degree of certainty necessary to support operational-level decisions.  5-13.  Using accepted QA measures, theater validation quantifies the CBRN sample. It provides additional critical  information  to  support  timely  and  effective  decisions  regarding  avoidance,  protection,  and decontamination measures and medical prophylaxis and treatment for affected units and personnel. It can also support preliminary attribution to implicate or support trace analytics for the source of the identified CBRN material.

This  chapter  outlines  the  new  DOD  four-tier  system  for  determining  the  identity  of  chemical, biological,  radiological,  and  nuclear  hazards.  These  tiered  levels  provide  a  consistent  basis  for  applied military operational decisionmaking at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels. Chapter 6 discusses the sample  management/sample  collection  actions  required  to  conduct  CBRN  R&S  activities  at  the  tactical level.   5-8 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 25 March 2013  Chapter 6 Sample Management Quality sample collection is especially critical for analyzing and identifying CBRN threats/hazards.  In-theater  agent  identification  is  generally  conducted  by  the supporting environmental laboratories to support the commander’s IR. This chapter provides information on CBRN R&S sample management operations at the tactical level.  This  chapter  will  cover  sample  management,  the  principles  of  sample collection,  roles,  responsibilities,  and  key  tasks  associated  with  sample  collection. Further TTP can be found in appendixes H and J, which provides standard reporting requirements and guidance. Note that proper sample collection, the documentation of adequate associated information, and the use of appropriate reporting procedures are essential  for  operational  decisionmaking  and  to  address  potential  future  medical exposure  concerns.  Commanders  may  receive  the  mission  to  collect  CBRN environmental  samples  as  evidence intelligence  and  operational requirements. CBRN sample management operations are particularly important if a potential adversary uses previously unknown agents or if an adversary allegedly uses a CBRN agent first. The collection of CBRN samples and background information must  be  as  detailed  and  comprehensive  as  possible.  The  commander  may  order  a sample  collection  for  the  support  of  intelligence  and  operational  requirements (verification  that  an  attack  has  occurred,  identification  of  agents  used,  delivery systems and their nation of origin, and determination of the level of CBRN warfare technology involved).  to  support CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR RECONNAISSANCE AND SURVEILLANCE SAMPLE MANAGEMENT PRIORITIES 6-1.  Chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) sample management is the process whereby CBRN samples are collected, packaged, transported, stored, transferred, analyzed, tracked, and disposed. It begins with the decision to collect CBRN samples and continues to the reporting of information produced by the final analysis of that sample. This process includes safeguarding and prioritizing CBRN samples, tracking their movements and analytical status, and reporting the end result of sample analysis. The CBRN sample management process establishes procedures, guidelines, and constraints at staff and unit levels to protect and preserve the integrity of CBRN samples that  may have tactical, operational, and/or strategic implications. (See figure 6-1, page 6-2.) 6-2.  CBRN R&S sample management priorities may be established by the commander to coincide with PIR.  Sample  management  feeds  into  ISR  planning.  At  each  level  of  command,  sample  management operations must be precisely defined within the area of responsibility (AOR). Sample transport across an AOR must be deliberately planned, controlled, tracked, and executed at all levels. 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 6-1 Chapter 6 Figure 6-1. CBRN sample management process SAMPLE MANAGEMENT ELEMENTS 6-3.  Sample management includes the development of a sample management plan, selection of sample collection  areas/locations,  documentation  of  missions,  and  identification  of  key  tasks  associated  with specific  sample  management  operations.  The  following  should  be  considered  when  conducting  sample management:   Not  all  of  the  samples  taken  in  a  joint  operations  area  are  meant  to  be  evacuated  to  the continental  United  States  (CONUS).  Many  factors  will  influence  the  requirement  to  take samples and determine what level of identification is needed. The commander’s PIR will drive the prioritization of CBRN sample collection within the AOR.   The  requirement  to  transport  CBRN  samples  to  supporting  laboratories  while  maintaining  a chain  of  custody  is  of  significant  importance.  Under  normal  circumstances,  the  CBRN  R&S element is responsible for the evacuation of their samples to a designated sample transfer point. However, depending on the proximity of the supporting laboratory, the CBRN R&S asset may be required to evacuate the sample directly to the laboratory.   The command must ensure that it has an executable plan to get the samples to the supporting laboratories.  In  some  cases,  dedicated  assets  are  used  to  escort  samples.  The  priority  for dedicated assets will likely go to escorting samples from the theater back to the CONUS-based national laboratories for definitive analysis and identification.   The  combatant  commander’s  sample  management  plan  must  include  the  escort  of  samples within the AOR. This may require using other available assets as sample couriers. At all times, the chain of custody must be maintained to ensure accurate reporting of the sample collection operation results. Safety and security for the courier and the sample package must be ensured. A set of basic tasks can be used to train in-theater couriers to transport CBRN samples. The basic tasks are—   Conduct coordination.   Conduct linkup.   Ensure package integrity.   Transfer the sample (chain of custody).  Safeguard, transport, and track the sample. 6-4.  Further details about the above tasks can be found in appendix H. 6-2 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 25 March 2013 Sample Management SAMPLE MANAGEMENT PLAN 6-5.  A  sample management plan is essential to a successful CBRN R&S operation. The plan defines the strategies and methods to best fulfill the objectives of the commander. Each sample management mission is unique; therefore, it requires a plan that is individually tailored to mission requirements. In many cases, large amounts of collection material might not be available; therefore, it becomes imperative that a sample management plan establishes priorities of collection to ensure that the most important samples are taken first. The most important consideration is that the sample accurately reflects the scene and that it has not been contaminated by the collection or handling process. A sample management plan that will yield the most accurate results must be constructed for each CBRN R&S operation—with considerations given to the sample  media,  associated  key  tasks,  and  sample  collection  techniques  required  to  support  a  successful operation. 6-6.  The  sample  management  plan  is  drafted  and  contains  the  minimum  requirements  to  meet  the commander’s objectives. It includes the—  Purpose  and  scope  of  the  CBRN  R&S  operation,  including  the  objectives,  limitations,  who should  conduct  the  sample  collection  operation  (CBRN  personnel,  preventive  medicine [PVNTMED] personnel, tactical forces), and pertinent background information.   Contaminants  or  type  of  contaminants  expected  to  be  encountered  based  on  intelligence information.   Number of “duplicates” required of each sample. In some cases, samples are sent to different laboratories for processing (theater laboratory, HN laboratory).   Number of quality assurance/quality control and background samples to be taken.   Time schedule (how long the sample collection mission will last).   Documentation and disposition of samples.  Supporting sample transfer point locations or locations to deliver the sample. Supporting assets (security, decontamination). Sample disposition procedures.   6-7.  Sample courier duties will be AOR-dependent. Sample courier duties are as follows:   Conduct coordination.   Obtain and carry detection and identification (ID) kits and equipment.   Obtain appropriate respiratory protection and gloves.   Ensure that immunizations are up to date.   Begin prophylaxis if required.   Obtain approved decontaminant solution.   Establish a linkup point with the CBRN sample element.   Conduct linkup.   Don respiratory protection and gloves prior to the linkup.   Report the linkup to higher headquarters.   Ensure package integrity.   Use detection and ID equipment to determine if the outside of the package is contaminated.   Ensure  that  the  package  is  packed  according  to  applicable  guidance  (for  example, International Air Transport Association [IATA] or Code of Federal Regulations [CFR]), Air Force Manual 24-204 or Military Standard [MIL STD] 129P). Place in an additional transport bag/container as appropriate.    Conduct a surface wipe-down of the package.   Conduct self-decontamination if required. Note. Once the package integrity is verified, respiratory protection is no longer required.   Transfer the sample (chain of custody). 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 6-3 Chapter 6   Transfer the sample package using the appropriate chain-of-custody forms and procedures.   Report the transfer of custody to higher headquarters.   Coordinate movement.   Report the departure and start of movement.   Coordinate  with  the  applicable  operations  elements  as  required  (for  example,  movement through unit sectors).  Safeguard and transport the sample.   Be prepared to conduct immediate action in the event of a package breach.   Ensure that IPE is on hand during movement.   Maintain the sample at 1°C to 4°C.    Conduct decontamination of the package if required.   Report a package breach if required. Seal and repackage if required. Note. Sample collection and processing procedures can be found in appendix H. SAMPLE LABELING AND CHAIN OF CUSTODY 6-8.  Samples must be properly labeled and marked to meet standards and should be accompanied by a strict  chain  of  custody  maintained  for  every  sample  collected.  The  chain-of-custody  document  must accompany the sample during transport from the point of collection, to the receiving laboratory, to the final disposition of the sample. The chain of custody will—   Provide answers about the sample: When was it collected? Who has maintained custody of it? What has been done with it at each change of custody? What happened to it while in custody? Show each time that the sample is transferred to another individual, element, unit, or agency. The receiving person must sign the document to show that he received the sample. COMMON GUIDELINES 6-9.  Collecting  samples  and  subsequent  identification  can  provide  the  commander  with  intelligence information that answers the PIR, senses the adversary’s intentions or actions, knows why the information is relevant, knows what the impacts are; and knows what precautions are needed. While specific procedures vary, there are common guidelines that apply to any sample collection operation. Safety is the foremost concern  during  a  sample  management  operation.  The  sample  area/location  may  be  inherently  dangerous and  contaminated.  The  following  common  guidelines  should  be  considered  when  CBRN  R&S  elements collect samples:  Identify threats/hazards that could impact the sample collection operation. Develop a plan for minimizing or avoiding the threat/hazard, to include environmental and other threats/hazards in the  immediate  area  (heat,  cold,  slipping,  noise,  electrical  shock,  venomous  snakes,  bug  bites, rodents).   Ensure that personnel involved in the operation are dressed in the appropriate level of protection commensurate with the associated threats/hazards.   Ensure  that  the  sample  collection  area/location  is  clear  of  secondary  devices  or  triggered mechanisms that could destroy the sample or cause harm to the CBRN R&S element before the operation. Remain vigilant for the possibility that these devices may be present. If any devices are found, immediately clear the area/location and inform the higher headquarters so that they can contact explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) assets to render the devices safe. Do not proceed with sample collection operations until notified that it is safe to do so.   Ensure  that  backup  personnel  are  be  dressed  in  the  appropriate  IPE/PPE,  have  monitoring devices, and are prepared to enter the area/location as an emergency rescue team. 6-4 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 25 March 2013 Sample Management KEY TASKS ASSOCIATED WITH SAMPLE MANAGEMENT 6-10.  The  commander  and  staff  must  ensure  that  the  CBRN  R&S  element  is  trained  and  equipped  to perform  the  key  tasks  of  conducting  the  sample  management  operation.  In  some  circumstances, commanders may require technical-level expertise (CBRN specialists, PVNTMED personnel) over tactical forces  that  are  CBRN-capable.  CBRN  R&S  elements  are  generally  tasked  for  collecting  and  initially packaging agent samples. PVNTMED and CBRN R&S elements are responsible for environmental sample collection,  but  PVNTMED  are  responsible  for  environment  health  sample  collection  and  exposure surveillance. Specially trained personnel are responsible for collecting biomedical samples. The key tasks are collect, package, transport, store, transfer, analyze, track, report, safeguard, and dispose. The chain-of-custody process begins when the sample is collected. The chain of custody is critical because it provides an audit trail of when and where the sample was taken. The team assigns an identification number and affixes it to the sample or its container to aid in identification. (For detailed information on the chain of custody, see appendix H.) COLLECT 6-11.  The  preparation  of  a  sample  collection  order  requires  detailed  coordination  and  careful  execution. Unit missions, capabilities, and authorized equipment cause differences in how samples are collected and processed.  The  quality  of  any  analytical  evaluation  is  directly  related  to  the  quality  of  the  sample  or specimen and the degree of sample degradation that occurs before testing. PACKAGE 6-12.  Once  the  sample  has  been  collected,  proper  packaging  and  decontamination  of  each  layer  of packaging is instrumental during the sample collection operation. Packaging procedures can be found in appendix H. WARNING For safety and to eliminate the chance of cross contamination, each layer of a sample container must be decontaminated during packaging. TRANSPORT 6-13.  There are specific requirements to effectively transport a sample to the appropriate agency or transfer point.  Collected  samples  may  be  transported  to  a  sample  transfer  point,  which  may  also  be  the decontamination point. Samples are generally escorted during the entire evacuation process to ensure safety and  maintain  the  chain  of  custody.  Technical  escort  (TE)  capability  is  preferred  during  the  transport process,  but  may  not  always  be  practical  due  to  the  limited  number  of  TE  trained  personnel.  Once  the sample has been collected, proper packaging is instrumental during the sample collection operation. STORE 6-14.  Those samples specifically designated for transport/delivery to theater or CONUS laboratories must be stored properly until it can get to the laboratory. In general, samples should be stored at 1°C to 4°C. TRANSFER 6-18.  When  samples  are  transferred  from  one  unit  or  agency  to  another,  a  custody  transfer  occurs.  A custody transfer also occurs when supervision of the sample changes. Sample transfers or custody changes are documented. Each time the sample is transferred to another unit or agency, the receiving unit or agency must  sign  the  document  to  show  that  they  have  received  the  sample.  (See  appendix  H  for  detailed 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 6-5 Chapter 6 information on transfers and chain of custody.) The least number of transfers maintains the integrity of the sample and minimizes the chance of the sample being compromised. Generally, at the minimum the—   Transfer of samples occurs between the CBRN R&S element and the sample courier, between sample couriers at different levels, and between the sample courier and the receiving laboratory for first or subsequent analysis.   Transfer  of  samples  occurs  between  the  escort  team  and  the  supporting  laboratory  or  the destination  designated  by  the  commander  (for  example,  sample  transfer  point  in  an  adjoining AOR). ANALYZE 6-19.  Analyzing samples produces the information a commander requires to make decisions. Analyzing a sample to identify its characteristics begins on initial collection and can continue after it arrives at CONUS laboratories. REPORT 6-20.  Reporting the results of an analysis of a suspect CBRN environmental sample can fulfill the IR of the commander. Reporting should occur as new information is discovered about a suspected CBRN hazard and its associated samples. Initial reports will not contain the depth of information that a commander needs to make long-term decisions. Initial reports can provide sufficient information to make immediate decisions needed to save lives and prevent further injuries. See examples of report forms in appendix J. SAFEGUARD 6-21.  Safeguarding  samples  during  transport  and  storage  must  occur  at  all  times.  CBRN  samples  are hazardous; and if released inadvertently, they could cause injury or death to those that are exposed to them. A sample must also be safeguarded so that it is maintained to the standards that will ensure its viability until it can be analyzed at its destination laboratory. TRACK 6-22.  Continually  throughout  the  sample  management  process,  the  sample  must  be  tracked  to  ensure positive  chain  of  custody,  accountability,  integrity  of  the  sample,  adherence  to  time  schedules,  and visibility of analytical status updates. The task of tracking is critical to supporting objectives established in the sample management plan. DISPOSE 6-23.  CBRN  samples  must  be  disposed  of  properly  so  that  exposure  does  not  occur  to  unprotected personnel.  Once  a  sample  is  no  longer  required,  it  must  be neutralized  by  the proper  decontaminates  or taken to an effective storage facility designed to safeguard the sample from inadvertent release. ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 6-24.  The  operational  theater  commander  is  responsible  for  CBRN  sample  collection  and  identification. When  operations  involve  a  known  or  likely  potential  for  contamination,  commanders  may  consider establishing  an  integrated  crisis  action  team  from  the  staff  (including  operations,  logistics,  intelligence, medical, and CBRN personnel) for managing CBRN sample collection operations in an area/location that is subject  to  attack  or  contamination.  When  preparing  a  sample  management  plan,  commanders  should provide early guidance on the—   Number of teams to be used and their tasking.   OEG, military exposure guidelines, and individual protection guidance (see TG 230 and JP 3-11 for further guidance).   Allocation  of  operational  resources.  Missions  may  result  in  contamination  of  equipment, vehicles, and aircraft.  6-6 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 25 March 2013 Sample Management  Intended  use  of  HN  assets.  The  plan  may  require  liaison  with  diplomats,  firefighters,  police, laboratories, medical personnel, and other HN assets.    Media issues, such as rules for engaging the media regarding missions and explaining technical information.   Requirement for secure communications and reporting chains.   Designation  of  logistics  priorities  regarding  safe  handling  and  transporting  samples  and transporting CBRN R&S elements.  Intended final disposition and ownership of materials collected.  6-25.  The CBRN staff develops and implements sample management plans for CBRN R&S elements. The preparation of this plan should be coordinated with medical and intelligence sections to support the unity of effort  for  the  commander’s  intelligence  requirements  and  IRs.  The  CBRN  staff  may  also  conduct,  or acquire  the  results  of,  manual  or  computer-assisted  modeling  of  potential  area/location  and  downwind hazards. When practical, the modeling will be completed before the teams deploy. Depending on the type of mission and the resources available, the plan should address the—   Base structure, operations security, and logistic considerations.   Augmentation to the staff with on-site military or civilian scientific advisors and the issuance of related  WARNORDs  to  parent  organizations  within  and  outside  the  theater  or  organizations having an off-site technical reachback capability to contact required SMEs.   Augmentation to the command with trained CBRN R&S elements and the issuance of related WARNORDs to parent organizations within and outside the theater.    Need for air assets (aerial surveys, rapid transport of samples). 6-26.  The  commander  may  designate  and  allocate  the  necessary  military  assets  to  carry  out  the  sample collection missions. The commander’s staff serves as the nerve center and will command, coordinate, and control the operations associated with sample collection. 6-27.  The commander’s staff may receive reports from the following subordinate elements, depending on the nature and extent of the hazard:   Surgeon’s staff. Supporting environmental and clinical laboratories. Sample control sites. Security forces.   CBRN R&S elements.     Escort units.   Tactical units. 6-28.  The responsibilities of the unit staff may include—  Supporting  CBRN  R&S  elements  with  transportation,  interpreters,  security,  navigation  and communications  equipment,  food,  shelter,  medical  care,  decontamination,  collection  and decontamination waste disposal, and other functions needed to carry out the mission.   Ensuring that sample chain-of-custody requirements are met.   Establishing report protocols with the higher CBRN staff and command.   Maintaining reports.   Coordinating the escort of samples.   Coordinating for the establishment and manning a sample control site.   Routinely updating the downwind modeling.   Providing status reports to the operational commander and subordinate units affected by sample collection operations.   Coordinating  sample  transport  to  regional  and  national  identification  laboratories  for  detailed analysis.   Coordinating  special  storage,  packaging,  and  handling  requirements  to  ensure  the  integrity  of samples and the safety of personnel escorting or handling the samples. 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 6-7 Chapter 6 SAMPLE COLLECTION PERSONNEL 6-29.  Generally, the collection of environmental samples is conducted by medical personnel, PVNTMED detachment/personnel,  CBRN  personnel,  damage  control  personnel,  veterinary  personnel,  public  health officers, technical intelligence collection teams, bioenvironmental engineering officers, or other specially trained  personnel.  Trained  personnel  ensure  uniformity,  viability,  safety,  and  accountability  in  sample collection procedures. For more information on medical sample collection procedures, refer to Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Health Service Support in a Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Environment. CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR ELEMENTS 6-30.  A CBRN R&S element can be task-organized into different teams such as decontamination teams, an initial  entry  team,  an  emergency  backup  team,  and  sample  collection  teams.  The  size  of  a  CBRN  R&S element is determined by the size of the area/location, amount of personnel available, amount of samples to be  taken,  and  the  time  available  for  sample  collection  operations.  CBRN  R&S  elements  must  have  a minimum  of  two  personnel.  The  primary  objective  of  sample  collection  is  to  acquire  sufficient  agents, precursors, and degradation products for laboratory identification. CBRN R&S elements can be augmented with personnel who are experts in related specialist areas, such as—   A  medical  person  who  is  familiar  with  medical  and  epidemiological  effects  of  chemical, biological, and radiological agents and who knows epidemiological or forensic medicine.   An EOD expert who is specialized in chemical, biological, and radiological weapons.   An intelligence expert familiar with CBRN programs of the target country.   An interpreter.   A  technical  scientist  related  to  the  type  of  CBRN  threat  encountered  (biological,  chemical, radiological). 6-31.  Samples  generated  from  CBRN  R&S  elements  may  be  routed  to  a  single  sample  control  site  (for example, area medical laboratory) that is responsible for receiving samples and providing theater validation identification.  If  necessary,  the  supporting  laboratory  prepares  the  sample  for  shipment  to  a  CONUS laboratory for definitive identification. (See figure 6-2.) Note. Samples may not require analysis at all four levels of identification. 6-8 Figure 6-2.

They  will  have  detailed  knowledge  of  the  agents  and  sophisticated  sample  collection procedures. Their expertise can be used for—   Risk management.    The interpretation of results.   Aerial reconnaissance.   Decontamination and waste management.   Risk communication and public affairs.   The transportation of hazardous materials.   Medical management of casualties.

CBRN  R&S  elements  conduct,  record,  and  report  surveys  of  known  or  suspected  incidents.  They provide  prompt  estimates  of  the  severity  and  extent  of  hazards  using  a  CBRN  warning  and  reporting message. Additional responsibilities include—   Collecting, documenting, and initially packaging any samples taken.   Making prior coordination with intelligence and medical units.    Adhering to special sample collection tasks provided by the unit commander in the OPORD.    Coordinating and preparing for decontamination operations before beginning sample collection missions. 6-34.  The  Laboratory  Response  Network  and  military  environmental/medical  laboratories  will  be identified  to  support  sample  management  operations.  These  laboratories  support  theater  validation identification  and/or  definitive  identification  as  required.  (See  Multiservice  Tactics,  Techniques,  and Procedures for Health Service Support in a Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Environment for more information on Laboratory Response Network.) SUMMARY 6-35.  The key objective of this chapter is to identify the appropriate doctrine and tactics used for CBRN sample  management  in  a joint  operation  area.  Achieving these  sample  management  activities  will  allow personnel of all Services to complete their goals. The focus is to place the proper tools and methods into the hands of military personnel, so that they safely obtain a sample that is representative of the environment. Protection, prophylaxis, and treatment decisions can be directly impacted by analyzed results from CBRN 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 6-9 Chapter 6 sample  management.

Tactical,  operational,  and strategic  planning  are  interrelated,  and  the  actions  taken  at  the  tactical  level  have implications at the operational and strategic levels of war. Planning activities at the tactical  level  for  CBRN  reconnaissance  and  CBRN  surveillance  operations  are similar,  but  they  require  different  resources  and  personnel  capabilities.  One  of  the goals of CBRN R&S is to produce information that allows friendly force elements to avoid  contaminated  areas.  It  also  provides  technical  intelligence  concerning adversary offensive CBRN capability and is part of the overall intelligence collection effort.  It  is  performed  during  preparation  for  operations,  during  sustained  combat operations,  and  after  conflict  resolution  to  provide  information  used  by  the commander to support IRs. The CBRN ISR plan, CBRN ISR synchronization matrix, CBRN  collection  matrix,  and  CBRN  ISR  tasking  matrix  are  typically  prepared  in spreadsheet format. There is no set format for them, but they do have key pieces of information  and  should  always  be  accompanied  by  a  CBRN  ISR  overlay  that graphically depicts the information contained in the plan and matrices. CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR INTELLIGENCE, RECONNAISSANCE, AND SURVEILLANCE B-1.  Sample CBRN ISR plans and matrices are in the following figures (figure B-1, page B-2 is a CBRN ISR plan; figure B-2, page B-3, is a CBRN ISR synchronization matrix; figure B-3, page B-3, is a CBRN collection matrix; and figure B-4, page B-4, is a CBRN ISR tasking matrix). 25 March 2013 FM 3-19.40 B-1 Appendix B Legend: AA APOE BIDS C2 CBRN CHEM DTG FEBA ISR JNBCRS JBPDS MAGTF MEU MSR NAI NBCRV PIR PL R&S recon TE TEU avenue of approach aerial port of embarkation Battlefield Information Distribution System command and control chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear chemical date-time group forward edge of battle area intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance Joint Nuclear Biological, and Chemical Reconnaissance System Joint Biological Point Detection System Marine air-ground task force Marine Expeditionary Unit main supply route named area of interest nuclear, biological, and chemical reconnaissance vehicle priority intelligence requirement phase line reconnaissance and surveillance reconnaissance technical escort Figure B-1.

Sample CBRN ISR tasking matrix INTELLIGENCE, SURVEILLANCE, AND RECONNAISSANCE PLAN INPUTS B-2.  The IPOE/IPB process is used to determine key parts of the CBRN ISR plan through the following four-step process: STEP 1—DEFINE THE OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT B-3.  The operational environment is defined by identifying the—   Limits  of  the  command  operational  area.  The  operational  area  is  the  geographical  area  at which the commander is assigned the responsibility and authority to conduct military operations. B-4 ATP 3-11.37 25 March 2013 Planning   Limits  of  the  area  of  interest.  The  area  of  interest  is  the  geographical  area  from  which information  and  intelligence  are  required  to  permit  planning  or  successful  conduct  of  the commander’s  operation.  Sources  of  information  may  include  other  federal  agencies  operating within the area of interest (Department of State, national level intelligence agencies) that may have information that will help support the commander’s overall situational awareness.   Amount  of  detail  required  and  the  amount  feasible  within  the  time  available.  The  time available for completion of the IPOE/IPB process may not permit the luxury of conducting each step  in  detail  (for  example,  the  CBRN  and  medical  staffs  must  realize  the  time  sensitivity  of critical information [the time from the exposure of personnel to a CBRN agent until the onset of symptoms]). STEP 2—DESCRIBE THE OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT BASED ON THREAT AND FRIENDLY CAPABILITIES B-4.  This is accomplished by analyzing the operational environment, which includes an analysis of the existing  and  projected  conditions  of  the  operational  environment.  The  information  from  the  analysis supports  the  conduct  of  friendly  vulnerability  assessments.  Planners  identify  characteristics  of  the operational  environment  that  could  affect  friendly  target  vulnerability,  influence  the  commander’s decisions, or affect the COAs available to U.S. forces. Terrain Analysis B-5.  Terrain analysis reduces the uncertainties regarding the effects of natural and man-made features on friendly CBRN operations. It focuses on the military aspects of the terrain, including:   Observation  and  fields  of  fire.  Observation  is  the  influence  of  terrain  on  reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition capabilities. A field of fire is the area in which a weapon or a group of weapons may cover effectively with fire from a given position.   Avenue of approach. An avenue of approach is a route by which a force may reach key terrain or an objective. NAIs along an avenue of approach that an adversary may  target with CBRN weapons are also identified.   Key terrain. Key terrain is any feature or area that would offer a marked tactical advantage if an adversary seized it or gained control of it.    Obstacles.  Planners  identify  the  obstacles  (natural  and  man-made)  that  may  be  used  by  an adversary with capabilities (such as persistent chemical agents) to impede or delay the advance of U.S. forces.   Cover and concealment. Planners identify the cover and concealment that may be available to preclude possible targeting by an adversary.  B-6.  The terrain analysis is conducted as follows:   The terrain is evaluated through a map analysis supplemented by CBRN R&S.   Terrain factor overlays are developed and analyzed, including the identification of contaminated areas.   Combined-obstacle overlays are developed.   Avenues of approach are identified and analyzed.   Avenues of approach overlays are developed. B-7.  Terrain analysis examines the potential impact of surface conditions on contaminants (for example, the surface and soil type affect how readily a chemical agent is absorbed into the soil). The type of surface also  affects  the  persistency  of  chemical  agents.  Even  though  the  actual  operational  environment  is  a combination of conditions, looking at the general conditions separately (below), will give an indication of what  to  expect.  Surfaces  may  initially  present  a  contact  hazard  and  later  present  a  vapor  hazard  during agent off-gassing. Surfaces are as follows:  Sand. A sand surface is generally any surface that has a large amount of sand, and it normally has good drainage. When chemical agents are applied to this surface, they tend to be drawn into the subsurface, lowering the quantity of contamination available for liquid detection. 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 B-5 Appendix B  Soil. Soil is generally any surface that contains quantities of clay and loam. Depending on the relative  amount  of  each  soil  component,  chemical  agents  react  differently.  Normally,  some percentage of the agent is absorbed into the subsurface (until saturation).   Grass. Grass is generally any surface covered with a layer of grass, from a few centimeters to a half  meter  in  height.  A  portion  of  the  chemical  agent  remains  on  the  grass,  while  the  rest  is absorbed  into  the  underlying  soil.  The  chemical  agent  on  the  grass  is  available  for  liquid detection.   Mud.  Mud  is  generally  any  surface  saturated  with  water,  resulting  in  muddy  conditions.  The amount  of  persistent  agent  that  can  be  absorbed  by  wet  soil  is  inversely  related  to  the  water content  of  the  soil  (such  as  the  more  water,  the  less  chemical  agent  absorbed).  Under  this condition,  chemical  agents  remain  on  the  surface  longer,  thus  increasing  the  probability  of detection.   Engineered surfaces. Engineered surfaces (glass, steel) are nonporous. Artificial surfaces such as asphalt, concrete and wood are porous. Liquid agents are absorbed over time. In the case of asphalt  and  concrete,  this  absorption  generally  takes  place  within  timeframes  of  seconds  to minutes. B-8.  Terrain analysis also examines the impact of surface conditions on detection capabilities. The more absorbent  the soil,  the  less  liquid remains  on  the  surface.  This  decreases  the probability  of detection  by detector paper. The smoother and harder the surface, the higher the probability of detection with a CBRN R&S system. When the CBRN R&S system is detecting on rough surfaces, the sampling wheel tends to bounce, decreasing the probability of detection. On soft or porous surfaces, the ability of the CBRN R&S system  to  detect  contamination  can  be  improved  by  stopping  to  lower  the  probe  near  the  surface.  The heated probe causes absorbed chemical agents to vaporize. The vaporized agent can then be analyzed by CBRN R&S assets. Weather Analysis B-9.  Weather in the operational area is analyzed to determine its effects on friendly and threat operations. The operational and tactical environments require that weather and terrain be considered simultaneously and developed as an integrated product. Weather and terrain can be graphically portrayed to indicate the possible impact of CBRN weapons within an operational area. For example, weather conditions influence the  persistency  of  liquid  contamination.  Such  contamination  is  detected  in  two  ways—as  a  vapor  (as  it evaporates)  or  by  physical  contact.  As  wind  speed  and  temperature  increase,  the  evaporation  of  liquid contamination  increases.  This  means  that  there  are  more  vapors  present  to  detect,  thus  increasing  the probability of detection. The following factors should be considered when analyzing weather aspects:   Wind  speed  and  direction  can  impact  the  downwind  travel  and  hazard  areas  associated  with CBRN agents.   Atmospheric stability can play a key factor in the analysis of when an adversary may use CBRN weapons.   Temperature and humidity have a direct impact on the performance of personnel and equipment. Temperature extremes and humidity reduce the capabilities of personnel and equipment and may require the use of special personnel shelters or equipment. Other Analysis B-10. This  includes  all  aspects  of  the  operational  environment  that  affect  friendly  or  threat  COAs  not already incorporated into terrain and weather analyses. STEP 3—EVALUATE THE ADVERSARY B-11. Adversary evaluation is a detailed study of adversary forces and their composition and organization, tactical doctrine, weapons, equipment, and supporting systems. Adversary evaluation determines adversary capabilities and limitations and how the adversary would fight if not constrained by weather and terrain. The steps in the evaluation process are: B-6 ATP 3-11.37 25 March 2013 Planning   Identify  adversary  capabilities.  Adversary  capabilities  are  broad  COAs  and  supporting operations  used  by  the  adversary  to  influence  the  accomplishment  of  the  friendly  mission. Planners use intelligence information to assess possible adversary offensive CBRN capabilities and to assess the potential impact of agent use. Identify  gaps  in  the  current  intelligence  holdings.  Planners  prioritize  gaps  in  the  current holdings on adversary offensive CBRN capabilities using the commander’s initial IR. The early identification of gaps allows planners to initiate action to collect the CBRN intelligence required to fill the gaps.   Create  or  update  threat  models.  Threat  evaluation  is  performed  by  knowing  the  threat  and using decision support tools that would portray how adversary CBRN weapon use could impact the operational area. The use of models and other automated decision tools provides a means to assess the potential footprint for an adversary attack. For example, the CBRN and intelligence sections coordinate and determine how an adversary may use his capability to get the best spread of agent on the target. Figure B-6, page B-29, identifies multiple factors to consider, including weapon fusing, direct or indirect delivery of the agent to the target, downwind hazard estimates, contamination deposition patterns, the theater ballistic missile threat, and CBRN hazards.   Create templates. This process converts the threat doctrine or patterns of operation to graphics (doctrinal  templates).  Doctrinal  templates  convert  the  threat  order  of  battle  data  into  graphics that  show  how  the  threat  might  use  its  offensive  CBRN  capability  according  to  doctrine  and training,  without  the  constraints  of  weather  and  terrain.  A  template  includes  a  description  of threat  offensive  CBRN  capabilities,  tactics,  and  options.  It  also  lists  or  describes  the  options available to the threat if the operation fails or if subsequent operations succeed. A template can identify high-value targets, which are assets that the threat commander requires for successful mission completion.  Weapon Fusing B-12. Weapon fusing affects when a munition detonates. For example, if a munition detonates at ground level, it deposits most of the agent in the shell crater, minimizing the contaminated area. When munitions burst above the target, wind speed and direction directly influence the spread of the agent. As a munition bursts, the heavier droplets fall faster and the smaller ones drift downwind. The most heavily contaminated area is near the attack area. The chemical agent radiates in a bell shape in the direction of the wind, creating a  contamination  footprint.  An  element  conducting  CBRN  R&S  has  a  higher  probability  of  detecting contamination  when  traveling  crosswind  to  the  footprint.  The  higher  the  concentration  of  the  agent,  the higher the probability of detection. The concentration of the agent on the ground depends on the type of agent, the time since delivery, the delivery method, and the type of ground surface. Agent Delivery B-13. Delivery of the agent may be direct or indirect. Indirect (off-target) delivery is generally upwind of the target area, and the resulting aerosol/vapor cloud or spray stream drifts onto the target. Direct or indirect types of attack can be delivered from a bursting munition or from a spray device. A radiological dispersal device (RDD) can also use a spray device. Munitions or spray tanks can be filled for dissemination as—   A finely divided powder in aerosol suspension.   Liquid splashes or droplets or as a finely divided liquid in aerosol suspension.   A volatile liquid that quickly evaporates into a vapor when released as an aerosol (explosively or from a spray). Note. Solid agents are unlikely to evaporate quickly enough to form a vapor, although frozen liquids will evaporate when the temperature rises. B-14. A bursting munition has a thin outside layer filled with an agent; and the agent is dispersed by an air or ground burst. An airburst covers a large area; a ground burst impacts directly on the target. In a ground burst,  the  explosion  drives  some  of  the  agent  into  the  crater,  where  it  can  persist  and  remain  a  hazard (vapor, percutaneous, or ingestion). The types of munitions used are— 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 B-7 Appendix B   Point source. A point source munition disseminates an agent from a single point. Delivery can be an air burst, a surface burst, or a penetrating round. A massive chemical bomb delivered by aircraft, missile, or artillery shell is an example of a point source delivery.   Multiple  point  source.  A  number  of  point  source  munitions  are  distributed  in  an  irregular pattern over a target area. Each point source munition spreads the agent as an aerosol or a vapor that  merges  with  other  aerosols  and  vapors  downwind.  Cluster  bombs  and  multiple  rocket launchers are examples of multiple point source delivery systems. B-15. Spray devices release chemicals from storage tanks or from containers carried by systems, such as aircraft,  submarines,  patrol  boats,  missiles,  and  other  vehicles.  The  degree  of  dispersion  is  varied,  thus influencing  the  duration  of  effectiveness. Spray  device  delivery  is  characterized  as  a  line  source,  which simply  means  that  it  disseminates  agents  along  a  line  of release. An  aircraft  spray  system  (internally  or externally mounted) is an example of a line source delivery system. Downwind Hazard Estimates B-16. Downwind hazards from biological weapons have a significantly larger potential area of effect than chemical  weapons.  If  weather  conditions  are  optimal,  a  downwind  hazard  can  extend  to  a  few  hundred kilometers.  The  quantities  required  for  biological  weapons  are  small  compared  to  those  required  for chemical weapons, and biological agents can be disseminated crosswind with few, if any, indications of hostile  intent.  Key  variables  that  affect  the  downwind  hazard  area  include  weather,  terrain,  the  type  of agent, particle size, and the type of delivery system. Contamination Deposition Patterns B-17. Contamination deposition patterns could result from a bursting artillery attack. The sample surface contamination pattern provides the basis for some general conclusions as follows:   Agent deposition generally radiates in a bell shape in the downwind direction.   The heaviest concentrations usually occur closest to where the warhead functions.   The  deposition  of  the  agent  is  uneven.  Deposition  concentrations  generally  decrease  in crosswind directions from the downwind path of the agent.   The contamination deposition footprint lessens over time, and the concentration levels decrease. Theater Ballistic Missiles Threat B-18. Theater ballistic missiles (TBMs) have unique characteristics that must be considered when planning defensive actions. For example, no other target system can put a warhead into the theater noncontiguous areas of operation or threaten neutral countries within a matter of minutes. Airburst warheads from a TBM provide effective area coverage and dispersion patterns for chemical-biological agents. When released at optimal burst heights, agents fall to the ground within 5 to 60 minutes in the direction of the prevailing wind. B-19. Large agent droplets or solids fall more quickly; small droplets fall further downwind at a slower rate. Similarly, the vapor released as these agents evaporate moves from the point of release toward the ground in a downwind direction. B-20. Secondary  threats/hazards  may  also  exist  during  and  after  some  TBM  attacks.  TBMs  may  have warheads  that  do  not  separate  from  the  missile  body  until  the  warhead  functions  or  the  missile  hits  the ground. B-21. In addition to the explosive, chemical, or biological hazards, the missile may impact a building or create  a  crater.  When  this  happens,  the  impact  area/location  may  contain  hazards  from  the  remaining missile fuel and oxidizer or from the facility or structure that the missile hits (fuel, power lines, munitions). Depending  on  the  quantity  remaining,  the  residual  fuel  and  oxidizer  (red,  fuming  nitric  acid)  can  cause detector paper to falsely indicate the presence of chemical agents or to mask the presence of an agent. B-8 ATP 3-11.37 25 March 2013 Planning Radiological Hazards B-22. Radiological hazards can include alpha, beta, gamma, and neutron radiation that must be considered when planning reconnaissance missions. The threat to U.S. forces could include the radiological hazards from  nuclear  facilities,  radiological  dispersion,  improvised  nuclear  devices,  sealed  sources,  reactor  fuel production, or luminescent military commodities. Nuclear Facilities B-23. Nuclear facilities may release radioactive material to the environment because of an attack on the installation,  sabotage,  or  an  accident  (for  example,  Chernobyl).  A  damaged  reactor  can  release  large amounts  of  radioactive  material,  composed  of  many  different  radionuclides,  over  an  extended  period  of time.  Radioactive  materials  of  concern  include  noble  gases,  halogens  (radioiodines),  mixed  particulate fission products, and transuranics (for example, uranium and plutonium). Consequently, forces downwind from an incident may face the possibility of external and internal exposure over a large affected area and for an extended period of time. The hazard posed by internal exposure to radiation is radionuclide-specific. Therefore, estimates of an effective dosage (that is, the dosage from internally deposited nuclides) highly depend on the identification and quantification of the environmental contamination, particularly airborne contamination. Radiological Dispersion B-24. Radiological  materials  are  used  in  many  industrial,  research,  and  medical  applications  and  are increasingly available. Dispersal falls into two categories—simple radiological dispersal and RDDs.  Simple  radiological  dispersal.  Simple  radiological  dispersal  could  be  any  dissemination  of radioactive  material  other  than  that  produced  by  a  nuclear  explosive  device.  It  is  specifically designed  to  cause  injury  or  area  denial  by  means  of  the  radiation  produced  following dissemination.  For  example,  an  adversary  could  create  a  perceived  or  real  health  threat  by securing a supply of radioactive material from a medical laboratory, an industry, or another site and dispersing the material into the public water supply or via an aircraft over a troop staging area.   RDD. An RDD can be defined as any device (including a weapon or equipment) other than a nuclear  explosive  device  that  is  specifically  designed  to  disseminate  radioactive  materials  to cause damage, injury, or area denial via the radiation produced by decaying radionuclides in the material. The use of the explosive or incendiary, mixed with radioactive materials, could create an  incident  in  which  the  initial  explosion  would  kill  persons  in  the  immediate  vicinity  of  the device. The radionuclide decay would continue to threaten first responders and others near the incident area/location. Improvised Nuclear Devices B-25. A  nuclear  detonation  is  the  sudden  release  of  energy  from  nuclear  fission  or  fusion.  The  prompt, initial radiation poses a severe external radiation hazard, while fallout poses serious external and internal radiation  hazards.  The  radioactive  material  produced  by  a  nuclear  explosion  is  composed  of  the  same fission  products  as  those  from  a  reactor  accident  and  may  include  activation  products  produced  when neutrons  from  the  fission  interact  with  the  surrounding  environment.  Plutonium  and/or  uranium  not fissioned during the nuclear reaction will also be dispersed by the explosion. Because of the large amounts of energy released from a nuclear explosion, the plumes of fallout and airborne contamination can impact massive geographic regions. Sealed Sources B-26. It  is  conceivable  that  personnel  may  enter  areas  where  radioactive  materials  have  been  left (intentionally or unintentionally). Breakdown in normal control mechanisms, collateral damage caused by combat,  or  malicious  use  by  adversaries  able  to  acquire  medical  or  industrial  sources  of  radioactive material could result in significant radiation exposures to forces. Sealed sources, by definition, are designed to contain radioactive material inside (for example, radioactive gases in glass vials, radioactive powders double-encapsulated in stainless steel, metal impregnated with radionuclides and then encapsulated). When 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 B-9 Appendix B such sources maintain their structural integrity, they pose an external exposure hazard from the penetrating radiation (neutrons or gamma rays). However, when the integrity of a source is compromised, the source can  present  a  contamination  problem  and  an  internal  hazard  from  the  nonpenetrating  radiation  (beta  or alpha particles). Commonly found, sealed sources that may pose a significant gamma radiation exposure hazard  include  iridium-192  industrial  radiography  sources,  cobalt-60  medical  teletherapy  sources,  and cesium-137 calibration irradiator sources. STEP 4—DETERMINE ADVERSARY COURSES OF ACTION B-27. Commanders determine the adversary COAs that will influence the accomplishment of the friendly mission. They—  Identify the likely objectives of the threat and the desired end state. Identify the full set of COAs and associated CBRN offensive capabilities available to the threat.    Evaluate and prioritize each COA, using judgment to rank the threat COAs in their likely order of adoption.   Develop each COA in the amount of detail that time allows. B-28. To ensure completeness, integrate the following CBRN considerations:   What. Identify the type of agents that may be used to support adversary COAs.   When. Identify the time the adversary may use his offensive CBRN capability.   Where. Identify the sectors or zones where CBRN agents may be used.   How. Identify the method by which the threat will employ its offensive CBRN capability.   Why. Identify the objective or end state that the threat intends to accomplish.  B-29. For each COA, commanders develop the following products for follow-on analysis and comparison: Situation  template.  The  situation  template  is  a  doctrinal  template  with  terrain  and  weather constraints  applied.  It  is  a  graphic  depiction  of  expected  threat  dispositions  for  each  possible threat  COA.  It  usually  depicts  the  most  critical  point  in  the  operation  as  agreed  upon  by  the intelligence and operations officers.   Event template. The event template is a guide for CBRN R&S collection planning. The event template  depicts  the  NAI  where  activity  or  the  lack  of  activity  may  indicate  which  COA  the threat has adopted.   Event matrix. The event matrix provides details on the type of CBRN activity expected in each NAI, the times the NAI is expected to be active, and its relationship to other activities in the operational environment.   Decision  support  template.  The  decision  support  template  is  a  combined  intelligence  and operations  estimate  in  graphic  form.  It  indicates  the  points  where  a  decision  from  the commander  may  be  required,  based  on  input  from  multiple  sources,  including  CBRN  R&S information. COMMANDER’S INTENT B-30. CBRN R&S planning is critical, and there is seldom enough time to plan for every possible situation. There are, however, essential elements (such as the commander’s intent and a complete mission statement) that must be included in all CBRN R&S plans. These elements provide a level of detail required to ensure total  integration  and  utilization of  CBRN R&S  assets.  The  commander’s  intent  for  the  mission  must  be clearly identified. The intent is what the commander wants the mission to accomplish when completed—a clear concise statement of what CBRN R&S forces must do and the conditions the force must establish with respect to the adversary, terrain, and civil considerations that represent the desired end state. INITIAL PLANNING AND COORDINATION B-31. Plan  and  prepare  for  reconnaissance  using  troop-leading  procedures  and  the  situation  estimate. Identify required actions to be performed at the objective, and then plan backward to the departure from friendly lines and forward to the reentry of friendly lines. The tactical CBRN R&S element leader normally B-10 ATP 3-11.37 25 March 2013 Planning receives the OPORD in the supported unit TOC, where communications are good and key personnel are available for questions and coordination. Mission coordination must be thorough and detailed since tactical CBRN  R&S  elements  act  semi-independently,  temporarily  move  beyond  direct-fire  support  of  the supported unit, and occasionally operate forward of friendly units. B-32. The tactical CBRN R&S element leader normally coordinates directly with the supported unit staff and  must  continuously  coordinate  with  the  support  unit  staff  throughout  the  planning  and  preparation phases. Tactical CBRN R&S element leaders must coordinate directly with the element conducting forward and  rearward  passage  of  lines  and  with  other  units  in  the  operational  area  and  adjacent  areas.  Items  to coordinate with the supported unit include:   Changes and updates in the adversary and friendly situations.   The best use of terrain for routes, rally points, and forward reconnaissance bases.   Light and weather data.   The security of the CBRN R&S element.   The use and location of LZs.   The departure and reentry of friendly lines.    Rehearsal areas and times.    HSS (including medical evacuation).   Logistics support.  Special equipment requirements. Fire support on the objective and along the planned routes, including alternate routes. Signal plan call signs, frequencies, code words, pyrotechnics, challenges, and passwords. Identification to reduce the incidence of friendly fire.    CBRN R&S plan completion. KEY OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS B-33. Consider the following for planning CBRN R&S operations:   Essential and supporting tasks. Ensure the assignment of all essential tasks to be performed on the objective, at danger areas, at security or surveillance locations, along routes, and during the passage of lines.   Key travel and execution times. Estimate the time requirements for moving to the objective, reconnoitering  the  objective,  establishing  security  and  surveillance,  completing  assigned  tasks while  on  the  objective,  moving  to  and  through  friendly  lines,  and  conducting  operational debriefings.   Primary and alternate routes. Select primary and alternate routes to and from the objective.  Signals. Consider using special signals, including approved hand-and-arm signals, flares, voice, whistles, radios, and infrared equipment. PLANNING COMPONENTS B-34. Consider the following CBRN R&S planning components:   Missions. Examine the mission. Ensure that plans cover ways to enhance the survivability and mobility  of  friendly  forces,  assist  in  the  regeneration  of  combat  power,  and  identify  forward combat and rear area/support areas.   Available resources. Ensure that plans identify—   Organic CBRN R&S assets.   CBRN R&S resources available from higher headquarters.   CBRN R&S materials and equipment available from the HN.   Coordination. Coordinate CBRN R&S planning with all staff elements, especially operations and  logistics  sections.  The  adversary  CBRN  threat  is  critical  and  requires  close  coordination with the intelligence section. The employment of CBRN R&S capabilities should not duplicate the  efforts  of  conventional  reconnaissance  assets.  Careful  deployment  and  coordination  with 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 B-11 Appendix B adjacent and supported units and fires elements will enhance unit survivability. Friendly units must know the location and intent of all CBRN R&S capabilities to avoid friendly fire. Simplicity. Exclude unnecessary elements, and reduce essential elements to the simplest form.    Organizational  relationships.  Clearly  define  command  and  support  relationships,  and  assign responsibilities.   Continuity.  Designate  an  alternate  headquarters  to  assume  responsibility  when  the  primary headquarters is out of action.   Versatility. Ensure that CBRN R&S capabilities are able to react to unexpected situations.   Effective  control.  Realize  that  CBRN  R&S  capabilities  will  operate  away  from  their  parent units. Electronic and CBRN warfare, along with the sheer size of the operational environment, will  make  communications  difficult.  Ensure  that  the  plan  establishes  a  mission  command/C2 system and provides specific measures to adopt in the absence of direct communications links or control.   Decentralized execution. Delegate authorities, yet keep necessary control.   Habitual  relationships.  Be  aware  that  it  is  beneficial  to  have  the  same  CBRN  unit  always supporting the same unit. PLAN DEVELOPMENT B-35. The commander implements the concept of operations (CONOPS) for CBRN R&S through planning and  implementing  risk  reduction  measures.  The  command  and  staff  use  their  situational  awareness (visualization  of  the  operational  environment)  to  identify  the  risk  reduction  measures  that  will  be implemented  in  supporting  operations  plans  (OPLANs)  and/or  OPORDs.  Methods  that  can  be  used  to examine, assess, and implement the risk reduction measures are included in table B-1. Table B-1.

Legend: C2 CBRN OPLAN OPORD TTP command and control chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear operation plan operation order tactics, techniques, and procedures B-36. As a continuous process, CBRN R&S planning employs an iterative method. The different factors interrelate  (for  example,  the  linkage  between  CBRN  detection  system  presumptive  and  confirmatory identification), support a time-sensitive process, and focus on maximizing the probability of detection. B-37. Preparation of a CBRN R&S plan entails completing a mission analysis, assessing COAs, preparing staff estimates, and developing the OPLAN and/or OPORD or annex. Critical operational considerations must be assessed during the decisionmaking process.  B-38. The  operational-level  commander  develops  an  OPLAN  and/or  OPORD  as  a  directive  to  issue  to supporting  or  subordinate  units  that  have  CBRN  R&S  responsibilities.  Situation,  mission,  execution, service  support,  and  command  and  signal  are  the  key  data  elements  in  the  command  OPORD  that  the 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 B-13 Appendix B supporting or subordinate unit uses to prepare OPORDs or FRAGORDs to support the higher supported commander’s intent. Situation B-39. The situation paragraph of the CBRN surveillance plan (table B-2) is used to provide the most likely and  most  dangerous  threat  COAs.  It  provides  the  mission,  commander’s  intent,  and  CONOPS  for  the headquarters one and two levels up. The situation paragraph also provides actions that other units (such as flank units) may take that can have significant effects on CBRN R&S operations. Table B-2. CBRN R&S planning—situation Situation Factor Operational Implications Adversary forces (Potential adversary facilities [WMD production facilities]/NAIs with potential of possessing adversary agents/ precursors) Identify an adversary list of CBRN agents. •  Detector/handheld assay tailoring.

Anticipate surprise. Identify potential CBRN R&S assets within the AOR. Identify CBRN R&S assets. Friendly forces The list of AOR-specific adversary agents can affect requirements for different types of detectors and the specific handheld assays used. Also, the type of adversary agent can drive the depth of the array used. It should be noted that all common surveillance reagents may be initially used, and all attacks may be surprise attacks. The type of delivery systems the adversary has available can affect how the CBRN detector array  is positioned (critical node versus area array). Surprise attacks by the adversary can never be fully planned for. Yet, they can potentially be the most effective. Flexibility, effective mission command/C2, and a robust detection array are keys to providing full-spectrum CBRN R&S operations that can potentially provide coverage against surprise attacks. Planning, coordination, and liaison determine what HN or other government organizations and nongovernmental organizations can provide for support of CBRN R&S. The commander and his staff must “think outside the box” about ways they can augment unit CBRN R&S capabilities. The command and staff analyze the task organization. The review determines what capabilities are available to support CBRN detection, escort operations, and health services support to include medical treatment, medical laboratory, and preventive medicine to assist with health assessment and medical surveillance documentation. The command and staff determine what other military assets are available within the AOR. Some of these assets may include HN and allied military assets. Review for other units or assets that may possess a CBRN agent detection capability.   B-14 ATP 3-11.37 25 March 2013 Planning Table B-2.

CBRN R&S planning—mission Mission Factor Operational Implications Planning Assess the mission statement to determine specified and implied tasks. Use this information for mission analysis. The mission statement contains the following elements: •  Who will execute the CBRN R&S operations? •  What are the essential CBRN R&S tasks? •  When will the CBRN R&S operation begin? •  Where will the CBRN R&S operations occur CBRN R&S operations?

The execution paragraph of the CBRN surveillance plan (table B-4, page B-16) describes how the commander  sees  the  actions  of  the  subordinate  CBRN  R&S  elements  fitting  together  to  accomplish  the CBRN R&S mission. It states the missions or tasks assigned to each subordinate CBRN R&S element, to include units that support CBRN R&S operations.   25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 B-15 Appendix B Table B-4. CBRN R&S planning—execution Execution Factor Operational Implications Timeline Decision tree •  High threat •  Medium threat •  Low threat Risk •  Plan ahead •  Redundant systems in place •  Protection Maneuver Confidence in results •  Laboratory •  Detector   The CBRN R&S plan must emphasize time as a critical factor of effective CBRN R&S. CBRN R&S data and samples are time-sensitive. The window of opportunity to protect the force through warning and protective measures is very small. Samples sent to supporting laboratories for confirmatory identification can deteriorate over time. A decision tree can be established that includes the types of decisions to be made at different threat levels. These decision trees should never provide rubber-stamp actions for each threat level. They should identify when a decision is needed and possibly a tentative set of options that have been developed during the war-gaming process. The amount of risk the command is willing to assume will impact the monitoring methodology (for example, all systems operational or sample collection interval). The confidence in a detection of a CBRN attack is affected by how it has been detected. Detection by one CBRN detector has a lower confidence level (medium) than if two CBRN detectors have made the detection (high). Theater validation identification from a supporting laboratory confirms and bolsters medium-confidence detections and further reinforces high-confidence detections. Confidence in CBRN detection will affect how a commander and his staff implement reduction measures.  The confidence in a detection of a CBRN attack is affected by how it has been detected. Detection by one CBRN detector has a lower confidence level (medium) than if two CBRN detectors have made the detection (high). Theater validation identification from a supporting laboratory confirms and bolsters medium-confidence detections and further reinforces high-confidence detections. B-16 ATP 3-11.37 25 March 2013 Table B-4. CBRN R&S planning—execution (continued) Execution Factor Operational Implications Planning After an attack has been identified (through presumptive, confirmatory, and/or theater validation identification), the unit must affect reduction measures. These measures may come  in the form of prophylaxis, heightened protective postures, and warning and reporting. Postattack sample collection and detector operations must be addressed (for example, increased or decreased sample collection). The headquarters command and staff that control the CBRN R&S operations have the responsibility to— •  Be the central node for the receipt of any information that may have an impact on CBRN R&S operations.  This includes actual detection data and intelligence, meteorological information, and medical information. •  Analyze and synthesize all pertinent CBRN R&S related information into reliable action sets. •  Recommend COAs in response to CBRN attacks. •  Decide on a COA in response to a CBRN attack. •  Disseminate information and guidance about COAs  Postattack •  Reduction •  Sample collection/ detector operations Controlling headquarters command and staff •  Receive •  Analyze •  Recom-mend •  Decide •  Dissemi-nate •  Execute mission command/C2 Maneuver ISR  in response to a CBRN attack. Provide mission command/C2 of operations conducted in response to a CBRN attack. Preplanning (what, when, value, and cost) The importance of preplanning cannot be overestimated. An effective and well-thought-out plan will save lives. The cost and value of the employment of CBRN R&S assets must always be considered. The costs of an effective CBRN R&S program are weighed against the catastrophic effects of a successful CBRN attack. Operational implication Point detection Standoff detection Minimum protocols Sample collection intervals Consistency/ standardization The plan should include the operational impact of CBRN R&S on the force. It provides a clear and concise direct relation between benefits and/or losses and effective and/or ineffective CBRN R&S operations. This should include consideration of the current military medical requirement to document all CBRN exposures and to determine the potential need for long-term medical surveillance of exposed personnel. Provides critical nodes to be protected. Provides standoff detector guidance (when available). Provides standard operations. Protocols should provide the minimum expected standards of conducting CBRN R&S, such as protocols for use during CBRN R&S minimum sample collection intervals, spacing between detectors, packaging of samples, and the time to execute sample evacuation.  25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 B-17 Appendix B Table B-4. CBRN R&S planning—execution (continued) Execution  Factor Logistically supportable Employment plan •  Where to assign assets •  Spacing  Lateral   Depth •  Number of assets   Prioritize   Allocate Fixed sites, ports, and airfields Maneuver land forces or maritime forces Operational Implications Any standard set should be logistically supportable. For example, if the dry filter units are set with sample collection intervals of 24 hours a day at 6-hour intervals, then each dry filter unit will be using, as a minimum, 4 handheld assays a day. The use rate of consumables will need to be considered when establishing these standards. To support the higher command OPLAN, the unit prepares a monitoring plan to indicate how CBRN detectors will be employed. Fixed site (critical node). To support fixed-site requirements, the commander will likely allocate point detector systems or dry filter units.  Maneuver force (area array). To support maneuver force requirements, the commander will likely allocate CBRN R&S systems. This monitoring plan should assign assets to specific critical nodes or into area arrays. Spacing guidance should be provided not only for the distance between detectors laterally, but also for depth. Guidance should be provided on what the priority of effort is and how the command will allocate CBRN R&S assets to provide coverage in that priority. Provide a scheme of maneuver that addresses how CBRN detection assets will best provide coverage against the threat. As part of the process array, placement, with regard to NAI location, is critical for successful probability of detection. The array type used is affected by the size of the area of operation. Mission duration is impacted by factors such as weather. Air and missile defense Information operations  Operations security/handheld assay agent codes Air defense warning  Other systems within the operational environment can impact how CBRN R&S occurs. The air and missile defense warning system can affect how CBRN R&S is conducted. For example, upon warning of a missile attack, CBRN R&S assets may be directed to switch from periodic to continuous monitoring. Codes have been assigned to the various biological agents that devices detect. The codes on the agent decode list are classified SECRET. The classification of these codes helps to maintain control of how a force reacts to a biological attack. The headquarters that controls the CBRN R&S assets maintains the codes and thus controls the release of detection data. Support tools can assist the commander and his staff in determining the impact of a CBRN attack. Examples of support tools include the Joint Effects Model, Joint Operational Effects Federation, and decision support system. These decision support tools can provide estimates of how far downwind the hazard will travel and an estimated footprint of the CBRN incident. Support tools to support decisionmaking    B-18 ATP 3-11.37 25 March 2013 Table B-4.

PIRs and CCIRs provide a focus for making the decisions on where to position CBRN detection assets. During the planning process, the staff planner must conduct a CBRN VA of the organization. The results of this VA are a set of vulnerability reduction measures meant to lessen the risk and impact of a CBRN attack. The VA can influence how and where CBRN R&S assets are deployed. There are various sources of meteorological data. The meteorological staff must be consulted to determine which of these sources are appropriate for use with any dispersion predictions. Once identified, these sources should also be disseminated to CBRN R&S assets. The background environmental conditions can also have various effects on CBRN detection operations. (For example, an area with a high pollen count may cause false alerts in some field detectors.) Harsh weather can cause difficulties in conducting CBRN R&S operations. Sandstorms, freezing rain, snow, ice, heat, and high humidity can affect air monitoring, sample collection, and sample transport. Terrain will also affect how and where detectors should be placed. Terrain can create direct and indirect effects on CBRN agent dispersion and downwind travel. International borders can affect how suspected CBRN samples are transported. They may also affect resupply operations for CBRN R&S assets. Assess the impact of background environmental conditions on detection capabilities (for example, background conditions will vary by season and time of day). Determine whether background levels may require the use of alternate procedures for CBRN detectors (for example, a release may not register due to high background and relatively low concentrations or a highly variable background). Force protection conditions are other tools that influence CBRN R&S operations. The higher the FP condition, the higher the threat. The planner can directly correlate his CBRN detection modes of operations (continuous versus periodic) and sample collection intervals to current FP condition levels.    25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 B-19 Appendix B Table B-4. CBRN R&S planning—execution (continued) Execution Factor Operational Implications Protection Protection (continued) Survivability Sample evacuation architecture Any additional coordinating instructions TPFDL CBRN R&S can be an integral part of force protection operations (U.S. Army: the protection warfighting function [specifically: survivability, FHP, CBRN and safety]). CBRN R&S provides the tools required to protect force from a CBRN attack. Inversely, the planner must ensure that CBRN R&S assets are provided the tools and ability to effectively survive. CBRN R&S assets are unique within the operational environment. Their capabilities cannot be easily duplicated or reproduced. Thus, survivability is of key importance when planning CBRN R&S. Sample evacuation is a key element of CBRN R&S. It must be thoroughly planned and executed to be successful. Key components of this plan include escort elements, routes, communications, control and visibility, and designated laboratory facilities. A high priority should be given to planning the flow of CBRN R&S assets into the AOR. As forces build up, so must the network of CBRN R&S assets, to conduct health-risk assessment and FHP. This network of CBRN R&S assets not only includes CBRN detectors and samplers, but also the mechanisms needed to affect CBRN R&S (escort, laboratories, CLS).

CBRN R&S planning—service support Service Support Factor Operational Implications Planning HN support Support concept CLS Standard military support  Waste Transport for CBRN R&S assets Transportation Transport of samples Transport of CLS   HN support must be considered when planning CBRN R&S operations. The HN can provide invaluable assistance in characterizing the AOR (developing baseline CBRN background data). It could possibly provide valuable laboratory support and hospital access for mass casualty events.  The service support section of the OPLAN/OPORD should indicate key information that includes:  The CLS arrival time. • •  CLS operating locations. • The CLS support concept. •  Restrictions on the use of CLS within the AOR. •  Retrograde instructions for CLS line replacement units or supplies. Wherever possible, the use of standard military support is encouraged. Many CBRN R&S assets use unique items not normally found using standard military logistics channels. Many such systems are supported by CLS. The planner must be aware that even though a CBRN R&S asset may have CLS available for its unique supply and maintenance requirements, they also require standard military support for all classes of supply and maintenance on common service items. Packaging, transport, and disposal of CBRN sample collection and decontamination waste should be considered and included in the R&S support concept. Transportation for CBRN assets must be planned well enough in advance to not hinder operations. Transportation of samples occurs— •  From the detection area/location to the sample transfer point or directly to the supporting theater laboratory. •  From a sample transfer point to a supporting theater laboratory or back to CONUS. •  From a supporting theater laboratory back to CONUS. The plan must address what assets will be required to make the transport happen. Time plays a critical factor in transporting samples. Samples can be perishable and will lose their efficacy over time. Also, the longer it takes to accurately identify the CBRN agent, the more casualties should be expected. Movement of CBRN R&S assets may be complicated by the requirement for their maintenance and support sections (often times CLS) to move parts and personnel within the AOR and back to CONUS. 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 B-21 Appendix B Service Support Table B-5. CBRN R&S planning—service support (continued) Operational Implications Factor Quality management, QA, and QC •  Tracking sample information •  Coordination •  Shelf life of supplies •  PMCS/PMS •  Cost of consumables  Safety Materiel services • Laboratory support Laboratory support  Personnel service support Personnel assignments Personnel training   The effectiveness of CBRN R&S operations greatly rests on how QA and QC checks are accomplished. Establishing a chain of custody from the theater of operation sample takers to the sample evaluators and to the archives requires a comprehensive understanding of the end-to-end sample flow, including intermediate custodians and their ability to execute their portion of the chain without compromising sample integrity. QA and QC must be maintained to track sensitive limited shelf life items such as handheld assays. The quality of the maintenance and storage of certain items affects the quality and effectiveness of CBRN R&S operations.  Safety must be addressed during all aspects of CBRN R&S.  The collection, transport, and analysis of potentially dangerous CBRN agents must always be conducted with the utmost care. Deliberate planning and precise execution of developed plans should provide the framework for safe and effective operations. The cost of consumables must always be deliberately planned. Heightened threat levels will cause a higher rate of consumption of resources. For example, sample collection intervals during these higher threat levels can impact on national/wholesale supply systems. Laboratory support for CBRN R&S must be identified and defined in the plan. Understanding the capabilities of the supporting theater laboratories is of key importance. The planner must understand the number of samples expected to be produced and sent to the laboratory, the surge capabilities of the laboratory, and the expected turnaround time for the analysis of the suspected CBRN samples. If the supporting laboratory cannot process the expected volume of samples, an alternate COA must be developed quickly to ensure timely confirmatory identification. These alternate COAs could include the use of HN laboratories, requests for and augmentation of laboratory capabilities, or prioritization of samples. Laboratory considerations need to be made for clinical and environmental samples. Many CBRN detectors do not specifically come with dedicated operators. As such, operators must be identified. These operators can be regularly assigned personnel, augmentation personnel, or contracted personnel. The planner must ensure that personnel identified to operate CBRN detectors are properly trained not only on the operation of their systems, but on other tasks (packaging samples, reporting, supply, and maintenance procedures).

CBRN R&S planning—command and signal Factor Operational Implications Who makes decisions regarding— •  Prophylaxis •  Protection •  Warning Communications support architecture The plan must identify the person that will make decisions concerning prophylaxis, protection, and warning. The plan must be clear and concise and leave no doubt which level of command will make each specific decision. When this decisionmaking is delegated to subordinate commanders, a clear understanding of the process of reporting changes in prophylaxis, protection, and warning must exist. The plan must include communications support architecture. This architecture will include how communications will occur among— •  The CBRN R&S asset. •  Supporting laboratories. •  Sample escort assets. •  Mission command/C2. Reachback capability Reports Reachback assets should be provided in the plan, and information on how to communicate with reachback assets. Required CBRN-surveillance reports should be identified, along with instructions on how and when they are to be submitted. Command and Signal Command Signal Legend: C2 CBRN R&S command and control chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear reconnaissance and surveillance B-44. Planning CBRN R&S operations includes the integration of METT-TC/METT-T considerations and CBRN  R&S  assets.  This  integration  provides  the  commander  with  the  ability  to  protect  the  force while efficiently executing his assigned missions. Example employment planning considers the following factors:   25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 B-23 Appendix B   Mission.  The  CBRN  staff  receives  mission  guidance  to  provide  maneuver  forces  and  critical fixed-site assets with CBRN-surveillance support.    Enemy. The IPOE/IPB indicates that the adversary has CBRN agents and line- and point-source delivery systems.   Terrain  and  weather.  The  terrain  is  relatively  flat  and  dusty  (an  arid  environment),  and  the wind speed and direction favor threat use of agents.   Time.  Based  on  the  time  required  for  field  confirmatory  identification,  postattack  medical prophylaxis is a viable option for the protection of U.S. forces.    Troops available. Joint task force assets include multi-Service CBRN R&S capabilities.  B-45. The  commander  integrates  the  CBRN  R&S  assets  into  the  command  overall  CBRN  R&S  plan  to support the command maneuver forces and fixed sites. CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR RECONNAISSANCE PLANNING B-46. CBRN reconnaissance includes actions that confirm or deny the presence of CBRN contamination and  associated  hazards.  The  goal  of  CBRN  reconnaissance  is  to  produce  information  that  allows commanders to assess the impact of contaminated areas on their scheme of maneuver, and support force and health protection decisions. It can also provide a means for the commander to evaluate the adversary’s CBRN  capabilities.  Reporting  and  developing  the  situation  accurately  and rapidly  allow  commanders  to make informed decisions on current and future operations.  B-47. CBRN reconnaissance planning follows the MDMP/MCPP, with increased emphasis on IPOE/IPB and the development of PIR. The CBRN reconnaissance plan provides guidance by assigning missions and priorities to answer the commander’s PIR. The IPOE/IPB and PIR determine what the commander wants or needs to know about the adversary (to include CBRN capabilities), the adversary’s purpose, and terrain and weather considerations. B-48. CBRN reconnaissance planning concentrates on the capabilities of organic, supporting, and adjacent units. It also focuses on the size and location of the operational area. The following must be considered:   Before executing a CBRN reconnaissance operation, command guidance should include:    Boundary of the route, area, or zone to be reconnoitered. The boundaries represent the limit of  possible  contamination  to  unprotected  personnel  and  serve  as  the  point  for  donning IPE/PPE and monitoring devices. Without a defined boundary, the CBRN reconnaissance mission may be too large to execute. IPE/PPE level and dosimetry required.    Turn-back dose rate and OEG.   Location and nature of medical support available.   Mission command/C2 relationships.   Communication protocols. Planning for a CBRN reconnaissance operation should include considerations for determining the  appropriate  level  of  IPE/PPE.  The  levels  of  IPE/PPE  discussed  are  defined  in  the MultiService Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical (NBC) Protection. The decision to assume different levels of protection during a CBRN R&S mission can be based on many factors, such as threat, temperature, hydration, and mission requirements. The  goal  of  choosing  the  right  IPE/PPE  is  to  balance  protection  requirements  with  necessary mission  performance  requirements.  There  must  always  be  a  risk/benefit  analysis,  made  with consideration  of  regulations  and  policy,  when  selecting  the  equipment  to  be  worn.  Some consideration for selecting the proper IPE/PPE are:  Selection  of  the  appropriate  IPE/PPE  is  a  complex  process  which  should  take  into consideration a variety of factors. Key factors involved in this process are identification of the  hazards,  or  suspected  hazards;  their  routes  of  entry  (inhalation,  skin  absorption, ingestion, and eye contact); and the capability of IPE/PPE to provide a barrier against these hazards. The amount of protection provided by IPE/PPE is material-hazard specific. That is, B-24 ATP 3-11.37 25 March 2013 Planning protective  equipment  materials  will  protect  well  against  some  hazardous  substances  and poorly,  or  not  at  all,  against  others.  In  many  instances,  protective  equipment  materials cannot  be  found  which  will  provide  continuous  protection  from  the  particular  hazardous substance. In these cases, the breakthrough time of the protective material should exceed the work durations. Wearing IPE/PPE can create significant hazards to the user, such as heat stress, physical and psychological stress, impaired vision, constricted mobility, and limited communication capabilities.   Other  factors  in  this  selection  process  to  be  considered  are  matching  the  IPE/PPE  to  the user’s work requirements and task-specific conditions. The durability of IPE/PPE materials, such as tear strength and seam strength, should be considered in relation to the tasks to be performed. The effects of IPE/PPE in relation to heat stress and task duration are a factor in selecting and using IPE/PPE. In some cases, layers of IPE/PPE may be necessary to provide sufficient protection, or to protect expensive IPE/PPE inner garments, suits, or equipment.  The  more  that  is  known  about  the  hazards  in  the  area,  the  easier  the  job  of  IPE/PPE selection  becomes.  As  more  information  about  the  hazards  and  conditions  at  the reconnaissance area becomes available, the area supervisor can make decisions to upgrade or downgrade the level of IPE/PPE. Protective headgear is needed where head hazards are present and may need to be secured to the user’s head.      Leather  palm  gloves  will  help  protect  the  chemical-resistant  gloves  from  puncture  when required to work with or around sharp objects.   Disposable  boot  covers  will  assist  with  removal  of  gross  contamination  prior  to decontamination.    Operations that require entry into confined spaces, such as caves and traversing high terrain, may require the use of a harness. Note that harnesses are not worn over Level A protective suits  due  to  this  causing  a  loss  of  integrity  to  the  suit  material.  The  preferred  level  of protection for operations requiring body harnesses is Level B or lower. B-49. CBRN reconnaissance planning for fixed sites, shipboards, and installations requires the CBRN staff and  leaders  to  develop  plans  to  execute  rapid  postattack  response  actions  to  detect,  identify,  and/or segregate  contaminated  resources  and  areas.  CBRN  reconnaissance  planning  considerations  include  key military aspects, such as maneuver spaces, choke points, natural harbors, anchorages, ports, airfields, and naval  bases.  Coastal  terrain  features  are  also  critical  factors  in  planning  and  conducting  CBRN reconnaissance.  B-50. Planning  considerations  for  CBRN  reconnaissance  operations  also  include  the  impact  of  mounted versus  dismounted  operations  on  the  current  mission.  Figure  B-7  outlines  some  considerations  when planning for reconnaissance operations. PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS B-51. The following are planning considerations:  Friendly  and  adversary  situations  in  the  area  requiring  reconnaissance—based  on  METT-TC/METT-T and intelligence.   Time constraints affecting reconnaissance operations.   Level of accuracy required to detect and identify agents.   Relocation for direct attacks on fixed sites such as airbases, ports, and occupied facilities in the attack areas.  Split-MOPP operations for fixed sites and installations such as air bases.    Requests  for  specialized  assets  (CBRN  reconnaissance  teams,  chemical-biological  incident response  forces,  hazardous  material  teams,  damage  assessment  and  response  teams,  and contamination  control  teams)  to  verify  initial  positive  indications,  identify  agents,  and  survey unmonitored areas.   Mission command/C2 relationships.   Communication protocols. 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 B-25 Appendix B   Additional personnel to provide security for the R&S element.   Coordination with adjacent and subordinate elements within the operational area.  Plotting and tracking procedures for surveyed areas to avoid multiple surveys of the same area, route, facility, or NAI.   Levels of IPE/PPE and dosimetric devices required.   Turn-back dose and turn-back dose rate for radiological surveys.   Use of aerial assets for radiological surveys for speed and reduction in radiation exposure.   Marking procedures (see appendix I).   Number and types of vehicles to use.   Logistics and immediate medical support for the R&S element.   Location of the decontamination site.   Location and nature of medical support available.   Actions to take involving casualties from CBRN contamination or hazards.   Location, quantities, and types of TIMs at storage facilities.   Transportation routes and means of transportation for TIMs. B-52. Other  reconnaissance  planning  considerations  are  the  types  of  reconnaissance  and  key  tasks associated  with  the  mission.  Planning  considerations  for  reconnaissance  survey  and  sample  collection activities are as follows:   Determining the overall size, extent, area, and exact boundaries of the actual contamination or hazard.    Equipping the reconnaissance team with the right equipment to conduct the operation.   Using trained personnel to execute accurate detection and identification.    Obtaining a complete or incomplete survey.   Reporting procedures and procedures to manage and track reports received.    Determining  the  size  of  the  sample  collection  team  and  designating  a  sample  collection  team Selecting personnel trained to collect samples.   leader. Selecting critical areas to collect samples. Protecting  and  ensuring  the  integrity  of  the  samples  to  reduce  contamination  or  dilution  of evidence.   Documentation of procedures, including sketches and locations of samples, for prosecution and violations of treaties and agreements.   Coordination of the sample transfer point.   Labeling, packaging, and preservation procedures.   Decontaminating equipment and disposing of decontamination waste. Note. The most accurate identification can only occur in the laboratory. CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR SURVEILLANCE PLANNING B-53. CBRN surveillance planning supports the commander’s CONOPS. The commander’s clear, concise statement of where, when, and how he intends to concentrate combat power to accomplish the mission uses CBRN  surveillance  to  maintain  the  required  situational  awareness.  The  commander’s  concept  broadly outlines  considerations  necessary  for  developing  viable  CBRN  surveillance.  CBRN  surveillance  is conducted from peacetime to war. The nature of the threat and the technical complexity of conducting and maintaining  adequate  detection,  identification,  and  warning  against  a  CBRN  attack  necessitate  CBRN defense  capabilities  and  the  facilitation  of  appropriate  and  prompt  medical  actions.  CBRN  detection planning occurs at all levels of operations, from the strategic to the tactical levels, and across the spectrum B-26 ATP 3-11.37 25 March 2013 Planning of  military  operations.  Planning  for  CBRN  detection  provides  the  opportunity  for  leaders  to  limit  the impact threat CBRN agents have on operations. B-54. CBRN  surveillance  planning  consists  of  activities  required  to  monitor  aerospace,  surface  areas, places, persons, or things by visual, electronic, or mechanical means; warn and protect personnel; and treat personnel contaminated with CBRN agents, materials, and associated hazards. CBRN surveillance includes positioning personnel in the adversary’s areas of interest to collect information by physical observation of their  activities  (using  human  intelligence  [HUMINT]  or  electronics)  to  mitigate  the  CBRN  affects  on friendly forces. B-55. CBRN  detection  equipment  is  integrated  into  the  unit  ISR  plan.  CBRN  detection  equipment requirements are employed based on an assessment of the adversary’s CBRN capability. The commander will  prioritize  the  use  of  available  assets  and  establish  a  plan  that  integrates  the  use  of  all  available capabilities. The combatant commander’s CBRN surveillance plan integrates using the following:   Land-force CBRN detection assets. Land-force CBRN detection assets are employed in arrays designed  to  optimize  the  probability  of  detection  consistent  with  the  security  requirements. Assets will be located based on METT-TC/METT-T factors, ability of the sensors, and the size of  the  critical  asset  to  be  protected.  The  CBRN  detection  assets  that  comprise  the  Service-specific CBRN defense architecture will be optimally placed according to system attributes. This will  ensure  adequate  coverage  of  the  node  area  to  be  protected  so  that  adequate  warning  is provided to prevent a large part of the force from becoming incapacitated.   Fixed-site CBRN detection assets. Fixed-site CBRN detection assets are placed on or upwind of a location to provide CBRN detection and confirm or deny the presence of CBRN agents. Fixed-site CBRN operations focus-specified targets including ports, aerial port of debarkation, or SPODs. CBRN detection assets are placed anywhere upwind or within the location to confirm or deny the presence of a CBRN agent. METT-TC/METT-T analysis will determine the number of systems required as point detectors for critical nodes such as logistics bases or major airfields and/or air bases, naval bases, or ports. CBRN detection systems can also be placed on ships for improved  operational  dispersion.  Detectors  and  collection  devices  can  also  be  placed  inside critical facilities to monitor for CBRN agents. Note. Detectors may be repositioned according to seasonal wind patterns that would change the physical location of an upwind location.   CBRN detectors.  CBRN  detectors  are  used  to  support  monitoring operations while  ships  are underway, in port, or operating close to land masses. B-56. The CBRN staff recommends the employment of CBRN surveillance assets. Many factors impact employment and the plan may be adjusted based on changes in the weather, threat, and available assets. No employment tactic is 100 percent successful in detecting and identifying all CBRN threats and hazards. For example,  an  adversary  could  employ  a  single  point-source  CBRN  munition  without  the  release  being detected by a CBRN detection array. Factors that are considered in the employment of CBRN-surveillance assets include:   Estimating  separation  distances  between  detectors  and/or  collectors  at  critical  nodes  or  area arrays.   Recommending employment tactics for detectors and/or collectors of the array.   Determine the number of available assets.   Determine the size of the operational area. SEPARATION DISTANCES BETWEEN CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR DETECTORS AND/OR COLLECTORS AT A CRITICAL NODE B-57. The estimated separation distance between detectors and/or collectors will vary depending on terrain, weather conditions, plume model output, and the performance characteristics of the system; however, the following are suggested separation distances: 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 B-27 Appendix B   For point vapor or aerosol, the preferred distance between detector and/or collectors is 200 to 400  meters.  A  200-  to  400-meter  separation  distance  is  a  general  rule  of  thumb  for  the approximate cloud radius after agent dissemination. For stand-off detection systems with a large field of view and regard, and the ability to overlap observation zones, the distances between detectors and/or collectors may be as far as 800 meters. The  actual  distance  will  be  determined  based  on  the  number  of  detectors  and/or  collectors available, their capability, and the area to be covered. SEPARATION DISTANCES BETWEEN CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR DETECTORS AND/OR COLLECTORS IN AN AREA ARRAY B-58. Again,  taking  into  consideration  the  terrain,  weather  conditions,  plume  model  output,  and  the performance characteristics of the system, the following are suggested:   To estimate line source separation distances for CBRN detectors in an area array, consider the size (in width) of the area to be protected, an estimate of the length of the line source, and the number  of  detectors  that  should  be  in  the  cloud  path  to  support  CBRN  event-tracking.  For example, in the following formula, if the width of the area to be protected equals approximately 60 kilometers, the estimated length of a chemical-biological (CB) line source is 20 kilometers, and the commander determines that he wants two detectors intersecting with the cloud, then a total of seven detectors would be required. The following formula is a generic way to estimate separation distance (divide the number of required detectors into the width of the sector being protected). Each sensor has its own capability and that capability should drive actual separation distances if the number of sensors is available to provide coverage over the intended area.

CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR DETECTOR EMPLOYMENT TACTICS  B-59. The  CBRN  staff  will  recommend  a  CBRN  detection  and  collection  employment  plan.  The employment tactic for detectors and collectors will be based on the capabilities and concept of employment for the systems. The specific employment tactics that may be used will vary based on factors such as the following:   The CBRN risk assessment and IPOE/IPB (delivery system, delivery tactics).   Terrain and weather conditions.   The location and size of assigned NAIs.   The number of detection and/or collection assets that are available/required.   Distance from objects that may impede air flow.   Detector height.   The distance of the alarm from personnel to help ensure that alarms are heard.   Verification of detection using alternate means or technologies.   The commander’s guidance.   The desired confidence level to be achieved from the CBRN detection array. B-60. CBRN detection array employment tactics include: B-28 ATP 3-11.37 25 March 2013 Planning   Dice five. The dice-five pattern of deployment refers to the deployment of detectors or samplers in  the  pattern represented  for  the  number 5  on  a die.  The  dice-five  array  (figure  B-5)  is  well suited for employing a detector or collector on an aerial port of debarkation or SPOD (with one detector for each cardinal direction—north, south, east, and west). Detectors or collectors could be shifted in the event of a detector failure, weather pattern shifts, or other METT-TC/METT-T factors.  The  dice-five  tactic  provides  the  most  flexibility  and  is  particularly  applicable  for support of critical node (fixed site) or area array operations. The dice-five tactic is also adaptable to a varying number of detectors or samplers (such as seven or nine detectors or samplers). This tactic provides depth to an array (if an aerosol cloud misses one detector, another detector deeper in  the  array  should  detect  the  cloud).  A  dice-five  tactic  is  a  preferred  tactic  because  in-depth features should increase the probability of detection. Figure B-5. Dice-five array   Circle. Employment of detectors or samplers in a circle configuration provides 360° coverage. This tactic is effective when wind directions are constantly changing. Figure B-6 provides an example  of  a  circle  employment  of  samplers  or  detectors.  The  circle  tactic  is  particularly applicable to critical-node operations. However, this tactic could be resource intensive (based on the size of the base) and does not provide the depth of coverage provided by other tactics. Figure B-6. Circle employment    Picket line. The picket line is designed to capture a CB-aerosol attack coming from a specific direction. Ideally, it is placed upwind of friendly positions to capture a line source attack. Figure B-7,  page  B-30,  is  an  example  of  a  picket  line  employment  of  detectors  and  collectors.  The picket  line  tactic  would  be  particularly  applicable  for  support  of  a  maneuver  land  force; 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 B-29 Appendix B however, CBRN detectors may require relocation if the wind direction shifts. This employment tactic provides no depth to the array and has a limited application. Figure B-7. Picket line employment   Semicircle. The semicircle employment of detectors and samplers provides approximately 180° coverage. It is still directional in that it protects from an upwind line source release, yet gives more coverage than a picket line, and provides for moderate wind direction changes. Figure B-8 provides  an  example  of  a  semicircle  employment  of  detectors  and  collectors.  The  semicircle tactic  could  be  used  to  support  fixed-site  or  maneuver  forces;  however,  this  tactic  does  not provide detectors in depth. Figure B-8. Semicircle employment    Dense picket. The dense picket employment of detectors and collectors provides higher density coverage  against  line  and  point  source  attacks  than  the  other  employment  strategies.  It  is resource intensive and requires large numbers of detectors and sensors. Figure B-9 provides an example of a dense picket employment of detectors and collectors. The dense picket tactic could be used for support of fixed-site or maneuver forces. Figure B-9. Dense picket employment  B-61. As a function of CBRN surveillance, area monitoring provides early warning and useful information. The types of area monitoring are— B-30 ATP 3-11.37 25 March 2013 Planning   Periodic monitoring. Periodic monitoring is conducted at defined or predetermined intervals.    Continuous monitoring. Continuous monitoring involves uninterrupted surveillance for CBRN hazards in the area.  B-62. As a function of CBRN surveillance, the following are monitoring techniques:   Direct monitoring. Direct monitoring is the simplest, most precise monitoring technique. Direct monitoring  is  used  to  get  “eyes  on”  an  area  that  is  selected  for  surveillance  or  to  get  an unshielded  (outside)  reading.  Direct  monitoring  may  be  periodic  or  continuous.  Periodic monitoring is favored for accurate readings and detection and limits exposure. Continuous direct monitoring will increase exposure. Indirect  monitoring.  Indirect  monitoring  is  used  to  take  readings  from  inside  a  shielded location and may be periodic or continuous. Indirect monitoring may compromise the accuracy of  readings  and  detection.  Indirect  monitoring  is  preferred  when  conducting  continuous monitoring operations.  B-63. Planning CBRN monitoring activities during surveillance operations includes the following:   Using the appropriate detector to provide early warning.   Employing standoff capabilities.  Planning  for  upwind,  downwind,  and  crosswind  surveillance  to  maximize  the  advantages  of each.  Planning additional food and water for the surveillance team. Providing relief teams during long-term operations and at fixed-site locations such as naval ports and airbases.      Ensuring  that  necessary  medical  pretreatments,  barrier  creams,  prophylaxes,  decontamination kits,  waste  disposal  bags  or  containers,  medical  countermeasures,  and  professional  gear  are accessible after donning IPE/PPE.   Establishing mission support sites.   Maintaining a low signature to avoid detection by the adversary. B-64. As a compliment to CBRN surveillance, medical surveillance is conducted by medical personnel to establish baseline health conditions and monitor for subsequent deviations. Medical surveillance focuses on ensuring  that  CBRN  detection  and  collection  operational  requirements  are  met.  (Refer  to  Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Health Service Support in a Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and  Nuclear  Environment.)  Planning  must  include  the  medical  and  PVNTMED  staff.  Critical  planning factors must ensure that—   CBRN detection requirements are resourced (for example, operators are trained and tasked to operate CBRN detection systems). Sample collection techniques and procedures are rehearsed and understood.    A  CBRNWRS  is  established  and  provides  the  required  reports  to  higher  and  adjacent commands.   The sample evacuation process is rehearsed and understood.   CBRN detection resources are integrated into CBRN surveillance plans.  Surveillance  for  outbreaks  of  disease  is  performed  on  and  off  the  installation  to  identify  a possible biological attack. Personnel, food, drinking water, air, the environment, and equipment are monitored for CBRN contamination and the effectiveness of decontamination measures.    Accurate  records  are  kept  to  monitor  personnel  for  long-term  health  problems  that  could  be operationally related. 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 B-31 Appendix B CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR RECONNAISSANCE AND SURVEILLANCE LOGISTICS SUPPORT AND ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING B-65. Planning  for  logistics  support  to  CBRN  R&S  includes  tailoring,  task  organizing,  reorganizing, consolidating,  and  echeloning  forces  and  materiel  and  movement  requirements.  The  following considerations should be addressed:    Tailoring a general-purpose element to be CBRN R&S capable by adding trained personnel and equipment, which may require more logistics support for the missions.   Logistics for postmission activities such as decontamination, waste disposal, and recovery.   Reconstitution operations in preparation for follow-on missions.   Establishing  an  OEG  managed  by  the  CBRN  staff  to  prevent  overexposure  to  radiation  and planning to replace personnel for follow-on missions.  B-66. Understanding  CBRN  environments  will  aid  in  the  assessment  of  critical  reconnaissance/survey information. Environmental planning considerations affecting the detection of contamination hazards are soil composition, vegetation, terrain contours, and meteorological conditions.   Soil composition will influence the detection capabilities of reconnaissance efforts. For example, areas with a large amount of sand will draw certain liquid agents to the subsurface, lowering the quantity of available agent for detection, whereas other certain liquid agents may tend to pool at the surface.    Vegetated  areas  facilitate  detection  by  concentrating  agents  and  reducing  the  effects  of weathering.    Terrain contours influence the flow of agent clouds as they influence airflow. Agent clouds tend to flow over low rolling terrain and down valleys and settle in hollows and depressions. High concentrations are hard to obtain on a crest or the sides of ridges or hills.    Meteorological conditions influence persistency and hazard area coverage.    High wind speeds (more than 10 kilometers per hour) cause rapid dispersion of vapors and aerosols.    Higher  temperatures  increase  the  rate  of  evaporation  of  liquid  contamination.  While  this may aid aerosol detection, it leaves little liquid agent available for detection.  Precipitation  is  extremely  effective  in  washing  vapors,  aerosols,  liquids,  and  particulate matter from the air, vegetation, and other materials.   TASK ORGANIZATION OF CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR RECONNAISSANCE AND SURVEILLANCE CAPABILITIES B-67. Planning for CBRN R&S operations requires task organization of unit CBRN R&S capabilities (from organic or supporting assets) to provide the commander with critical information that support situational awareness. Task organization of unit CBRN R&S capabilities also consists of designating trained tactical personnel who can provide commanders with a rapid means of locating contamination and identifying and marking hazards in the absence of CBRN personnel who are specifically trained to conduct CBRN R&S operations.  B-68. The  commander  plans,  prepares,  executes,  and  continuously  assesses  CBRN  R&S  capabilities  to ensure the organized and uninterrupted flow of tactical units throughout the operational area. The objective of a successful CBRN R&S operation is for the unit to arrive at its destination in a condition suitable to its probable employment. The goal of all movement planning is to retain flexibility to execute a variety of plans to meet ever-changing conditions. The commander ensures that his CBRN R&S unit movement SOP contains specifics, and he conducts rehearsals so that personnel and subordinate leaders understand them. The SOP should use a standard task organization to simplify planning, provide flexibility, and allow greater responsiveness. B-32 ATP 3-11.37 25 March 2013 Planning B-69. A commander bases the exact task organization of CBRN R&S capabilities on the factors of METT-TC/METT-T  and  his  CONOPS for  the  CBRN  R&S  mission.  The  commander  task  organizes his  CBRN R&S capabilities, each with a specific purpose and task. The size of the CBRN R&S task organization is based on the available intelligence about the size of the operational area and type of CBRN hazard. (See Multi-Service  Tactics,  Techniques,  and  Procedures  for  Chemical,  Biological,  Radiological,  and  Nuclear Aspects of Command and Control for further discussion on task organizing CBRN assets.) B-70. The  minimum  number  of  personnel  in  a  CBRN  R&S  element  is  two.  One  member  maintains  a constant watch for hazards, provides security, and calls for assistance if an emergency occurs, while the second member conducts the R&S tasks. There is no maximum number of personnel for a CBRN R&S element;  however,  the  element  size  should  be  kept  to  a  minimum  to  reduce  the  number  of  personnel exposed to postattack hazards.  B-71.  Task  organization  drives  the  command  or  support  relationship  decisionmaking  process.  At  each echelon,  the  commander  task  organizes  his  available  capabilities  to  accomplish  the  mission.  The commander’s purpose in task organization is to maximize subordinate commanders’ abilities to generate a combined arms effect consistent with the CONOPS. Commanders and staffs work to ensure the distribution of capabilities to the appropriate components of the force to weight the decisive operation.  25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 B-33 This page intentionally left blank.    Appendix C Preparation This  appendix  provides  preparation  considerations  for  CBRN  elements  prior  to conducting CBRN R&S missions. This appendix provides preparation considerations for CBRN reconnaissance and CBRN surveillance.  ACTIVITIES C-1.  CBRN  R&S  preparation  activities  include  time  to  conduct  PCC,  inspections,  and  rehearsals; incorporate  security  measures  for  the  operations;  conduct  leader’s  reconnaissance  when  feasible;  and conduct movement and coordination for additional support. CBRN R&S preparation plans are established to help reduce the exposure of the CBRN R&S elements to a CBRN incident and to mitigate the effects of an incident on operations should it occur. During the CBRN R&S preparation activities, CBRN personnel systematically initiate vulnerability reduction measures that have been incorporated into their latest CBRN R&S plan. CBRN R&S activities are conducted to support the commander’s decisions on how to employ and protect combat power against the adversary. C-2.  The  level  of  difficulty  and  detail  required  to  accomplish  the  R&S  mission  directly  relate  to  the intensity of preparation. For example, positive responses to the following questions would likely increase the level of preparation and should be provided to the CBRN element leader: Is there a storage facility?    Are there munitions in the building?   Are they CBRN munitions?   What agent is in the CBRN munitions?   Has a threat assessment been conducted? C-3.  During CBRN R&S preparation, the commander and staff monitor preparation activities and track the  higher  and  adjacent  organizational  situations,  placing  emphasis  on  the  adversary  situation.  The commander and staff refine plans based on additional reconnaissance and updated intelligence information. The staff continues to disseminate these modifications directly to the CBRN R&S teams throughout the preparation phase. Preparations focus on planning those additional ISR operations required to answer the CCIR,  refining  the  plan,  increasing  coordination  and  synchronization,  and  conducting  shaping  actions within the force’s capability and operations security guidelines. C-4.  Preparation begins when the WARNORD is received. The CBRN R&S element leader provides the WARNORD or movement order to the R&S element and directs the initiation of preoperational checks. Following the preparation of the WARNORD, many key factors are verified or researched. These factors could  include  planning  estimates  for  the  potential  size  and  area/location  of  the  suspected  CBRN  hazard areas that must be surveyed and evaluated. War-gaming provides estimated downwind distances for CBRN threats/hazards. This premission planning is conducted in coordination with the intelligence section and is used  to  help  determine  the  task  organization  and  locations  for  CBRN  R&S  missions.  During  the  final preparation activities, CBRN R&S teams consider and confirm what tactics will be used for the missions.  C-5.  Because CBRN R&S planning and preparations activities overlap, the CBRN R&S element leader briefs  the  OPORD  and/or  FRAGORD  to  the  CBRN  R&S  element.  The  R&S  element  OPORD  and/or FRAGORD are oral or written. They outline important elements that include routes to and from the CBRN R&S mission (normally two entry and exit routes will be planned).  C-6.  If  the  CBRN R&S  element  is  not  collocated  at  the  supporting  area of operation,  the CBRN  R&S element moves to the designated staging area. Movement is reported according to the OPORD or SOP. On arrival, the CBRN R&S element completes preparation of the appropriate equipment, conducts PCCs/PCIs 25 March 2013 FM 3-19.40 C-1 Appendix C on  the  expected  system  to  be  used,  and  conducts PMCS  on  the  equipment  according  to  the  appropriate technical manual. During the final CBRN R&S mission preparation, the CBRN R&S element follows the action lists found in figures. C-7.  CBRN  R&S  preparation  includes  planning  for  security  when  selecting  areas/locations  for  CBRN detection devices. This reduces the possibility that preselected and routinely checked sites could be mined or that teams could be targeted for ambush during routine operations. As a general rule, do not conduct CBRN R&S operations outside established perimeters unless they are coordinated with and approved by security forces. The commander ensures close coordination among his subordinates. During the preparation phase, the commander can take CBRN R&S element leaders to a vantage point in the main battle area to rehearse  the  battle  and  plan  coordination  among  their  units,  if  such  a  site  is  available.  This  helps  the commander in transmitting his intent and in establishing common control measures for subordinate units. C-8.  Night  movements  require  special  preparation  because  not  all  personnel  may  have  night-vision devices.  These  special  preparations  include  marking  vehicles  and  equipment  for  easy  identification  by friendly  forces  and  repositioning  vehicles  and  personnel  closer  together  so  they  can  detect  each  other’s movement. CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR RECONNAISSANCE AND SURVEILLANCE PREPARATION CONSIDERATIONS C-9.  CBRN  R&S  requires  specific  considerations  to  successfully  prepare  for  a  mission.  Conducting PCCs/PCIs, rehearsals, leader’s reconnaissance, coordination, movement, and coordination for additional support will ensure that a CBRN R&S element is prepared for its CBRN reconnaissance or surveillance missions.  PRECOMBAT CHECKS/PRECOMBAT INSPECTIONS C-10. The CBRN R&S elements will conduct thorough PCC/PCI of R&S element and personal equipment. Any  detection  equipment  that  requires  periodic  field  calibration  will  be  serviced  and  calibrated  prior  to departure from the staging base. All R&S element PPE and dosimetry devices will be inspected and readied for operation. REHEARSALS C-11. When time and the situation do not permit actual training in the operational area, the CBRN R&S element replicates the conditions of the operational area as much as possible. The CBRN R&S element will rehearse the mission using a map or terrain board. The CBRN R&S element conducts rehearsals that will allow  element  members  to  adjust  to  the  actual  mission  to  identify  and  correct  shortfalls  that  may  occur during the operation. They incorporate security and additional support so that their role will not interfere with the mission. It is critical that the R&S element rehearse their actions from departure, to arrival at the area/location, until the mission is complete. Emphasis should be placed on executing contingencies (man down, adversary contact, communications loss, equipment failures). If used, replacement elements need to rehearse with the primary CBRN R&S element when operations exceed long periods, such as, two weeks. Conduct the rehearsal and prioritize tasks/events.   Conduct combined arms rehearsals.   Develop or refine a detailed standard operating procedure.   Tie mission orders to a purpose or intent.   Establish high standards so that they are met.  Provide feedback to the commander/unit leader. LEADER’S RECONNAISSANCE C-12.  If possible, the CBRN R&S element leader and assistant R&S element leader will conduct a leader’s reconnaissance  of  the  target  area  so  that  they  are  at  the  proper  location.  When  performing  a  leader’s C-2 ATP 3-11.37 25 March 2013 Preparation reconnaissance,  personnel  should  ensure  that  they  have  alarming  radiation  dosimeters  or  radiation detection,  indication,  and  computation  (RADIAC)  meters  with  them  so  that  no  undetected  radiation threats/hazards exist. The following steps are for performing leader’s reconnaissance: •  Step 1. Pinpoint the objective. If possible, accomplish this by checking terrain features in the area, not by directly approaching the objective. •  Step 2. Locate observation or surveillance positions, routes, and security positions. •  Step 3. Locate positions to emplace standoff capabilities that can be observed from a distance. •  Step 4. Determine or confirm the adversary situation in the objective area, locate adversary observation posts (OPs), determine adversary security status and activity, and adapt the patrol to the local sounds in the area. •  Step  5.  Designate  the  release  point  and  the  positions  for  the  reconnaissance,  control,  and  security elements. Note. Ideally, at least two CBRN R&S element members are left behind to keep watch on the objective from the time that the leader’s reconnaissance ends until the remaining R&S element deploys. However, because of the limited density of CBRN assets and the fact that most leaders’ reconnaissance efforts will be conducted using  maps and any supported imagery, leaving two members of the R&S element will not likely be possible. COORDINATION C-13. The CBRN R&S element leader, with support from the higher headquarters if needed, must make coordination  with  all  supporting  elements  (for  example,  decontamination  and  medical  support).  In  most cases, direct liaison should be authorized between the supporting units and the unit supported. For those elements supporting the R&S element during the execution of the mission, a linkup point and time should be coordinated and verified by all leaders. Linkup information must be provided (for example, frequencies, call signs, and communications security [COMSEC] codes). Rehearsals with these elements are crucial to success.  Decontamination  teams  must  review  and  rehearse  how  to  decontaminate  the  specific  R&S equipment, sample transfer should be rehearsed to ensure the safety and integrity of the chain of custody, and security elements must practice how they will be incorporated into the maneuver of the CBRN R&S operation. C-14. Coordination actions including the following: Intelligence exchange. Standard operating procedures. Frequencies.    Call signs.   Visual signals. Priorities of protection.    Linkup time and place.   March order.   Logistic support requirements.   Command relationships.   Risk assessment.       Personal protective equipment and dosimetry device selection. Personal protective equipment and dosimetry device checks completed. Practice runs through decontamination line. Instruments calibrated. Sample management plan.    Communications check. 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 C-3 Appendix C Security.   Required forms.   Contaminated materials disposal.   Convoy operations.    Medical support.   Linkup unit location and date-time group.   Decontamination support.   Logistics support (all classes of supply).   Maintenance.  Supported and supporting units. MOVEMENT C-15.  Preparation for movement requires the CBRN R&S element leader or the leader responsible for the movement to establish control measures from the assembly area to the reconnaissance area and follow-on orders upon completion. The following movement measures are not limiting but must be considered:   Map  of  route,  including  graphic  control  measures  (routes  that  provide  the  greatest  cover  and concealment to reduce vulnerability).   Tactical march technique (open column, close column).   Movement formation (wedge, column, echelon left).   Movement technique (traveling, traveling overwatch, bounding overwatch).   Established checkpoints; release points. Forward passage of lines (friendly).    Rearward passage of lines (friendly).   Bypass criteria (adversary).   Defensive actions. RECEIVE THE MISSION C-16. The following are part of receiving the mission:   The team leader conducts mission analysis with R&S element, including— Submitting requests for information.   Analyzing current intelligence products.    Determining initial routes into areas/locations.  Identifying first dismount and observation points on a map. Integrating security elements. Integrating other elements into planning (explosive ordnance disposal, medical, and other personnel). Preparing an OPORD.      The R&S element leader briefs the commander on the mission plan (OPORD format).   The R&S element develops load plans based on the number of personnel and equipment.   The R&S element conducts precombat inspection of equipment.   The R&S element conducts rehearsals.   Entry procedures.   Decontamination line procedures.   Emergency action procedures.   Reactions on contact.   Movement rehearsal.   Mission rehearsal with each R&S element member back-briefing his duties and responsibilities. C-4 ATP 3-11.37 25 March 2013 COORDINATION FOR ADDITIONAL SUPPORT C-17.  Based on METT-TC/METT-T considerations, the R&S element may require additional support to complete the assigned reconnaissance mission. Types of additional support the R&S element could require include— Preparation Security. Force health protection.     Dosimetry devices.    Decontamination.    Logistics. (Logistics includes food, water, fuel, ammunition, and equipment needed to detect and identify CBRN threats/hazards, and equipment for waste disposal. Commanders should account for  follow-on  missions  such  as  surveys  and  provide  logistics  support  during  extended operations.) Sample transfer and evacuation. FORCE PROTECTION/FORCE HEALTH PROTECTION PREPARATION C-18. CBRN  force  protection/FHP  preparation  includes  the  command  and  staff  assessment  of  CBRN threats/hazards.  In  response  to  a  CBRN  hazard,  the  applicable  OPLAN  and/or  OPORD  outlines  the priorities of effort and trigger events (decision points) that will result in a response that includes CBRN defense countermeasures. Preparations to conduct CBRN force protection/FHP include activities to:   Warn. The decision to warn, if applicable, is based on the assumption that there is a threat of an upwind aerosol cloud moving toward the warned forces. It can also be a notification or warning that exposure may have already occurred. A notification or warning should include protection guidance and/or treatment to ensure a consistent, effective response.   Protect. The decision to assume a protective posture, if applicable, must take force capabilities and  vulnerabilities  into  account.  Implemented  control  measures  could  include  using  available protective equipment, conducting detection and identification of biological agents, and assessing unit vulnerability to a suspected agent (vaccinated or unvaccinated forces).   Treat. Treat the following:   Chemical. For chemical agent exposures, the decision to administer postexposure treatment is made by the commander, with the advice/recommendation of the command surgeon.    Biological.  For  biological  agent  exposures,  the  decision  to  administer  postexposure treatment  is  made  after  there  is  evidence  of  likely  exposure  to  a  biological  agent.  The commander  makes  the  decision  with  advice  from  the  command  surgeon  and  supporting input from the CBRN officer and intelligence staff. The command surgeon will recommend the appropriate prophylaxis or treatment regimen.   Radiological. For radiological exposures, the decision to administer postexposure treatment is made by medical personnel.   Conduct prophylaxis and treatment. Prophylaxis is preventive action taken before infection or exposure. Treatment is the care of personnel after they have been exposed to a CBRN agent. For some  biological  agents,  there  is  a  window  of  opportunity  between  infection  and  the  onset  of symptoms  where  medical  treatments  are  particularly  effective.  Medical  treatments  that  are initiated outside the window of opportunity are less effective. Therefore, it is critical to ascertain which agents were used in the attack and when the attack occurred to mitigate the effects. Some prophylaxis and treatment preparation actions are:  Prepare for any unusual occurrence of simultaneous cases of illness with similar presenting symptoms, especially in regions with a higher likelihood of biological attack. Prepare to initiate protective  measures, such as vaccines or antibiotics, for those who are exposed but not yet sick. Prepare  to  document  the  affected  population,  possible  routes  of  exposure,  and  signs  and symptoms of disease.    25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 C-5 This page intentionally left blank.    Appendix D Mounted Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Reconnaissance and Surveillance This appendix provides mounted CBRN R&S TTP. Mounted CBRN R&S provides speed and added protection to CBRN R&S elements when conducting their mission. This appendix provides guidance on mounted CBRN R&S techniques for leaders and personnel who are conducting missions. Mounted CBRN R&S enables tactical forces to  conduct  missions,  while  mitigating  the  effects  of  CBRN  threats/hazards  on personnel who are executing the mission. Military vehicles provide some shielding from  radiological  and  nuclear  hazards  while  those  with  collective  protection  may protect against certain chemical and biological hazards and allow forces to move on avenues  along  unrestricted  or  restricted  terrain  at  a  faster  pace  than  if  conducted dismounted.  Even  though  personnel  may  be  mounted  when  entering  areas  that contain CBRN hazards during CBRN R&S operations, it may be necessary for them to dismount to conduct a survey of an area or move to surveillance positions in areas not accessible to vehicles. ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES D-1.  Mounted CBRN reconnaissance provides advantages and disadvantages. Speed and momentum are typically  critical  to  the  successful  execution  of  operations  that  the  CBRN  reconnaissance  mission  may support. Commanders decide when to use mounted reconnaissance over dismounted operations based upon task-organized assets.  D-2.  A  key  factor  in  mounted  CBRN  reconnaissance  execution  is  the  time  available  to  conduct  the reconnaissance mission. The commander must recognize that there is increased risk to the R&S element and the main body when the pace of the reconnaissance is accelerated. This risk can be somewhat offset by employing air reconnaissance and technical means to cover open terrain or areas of lower threat. D-3.  The following are advantages of mounted CBRN R&S:   When  time  is  limited,  conducting  the  reconnaissance  mission  mounted  without  exiting  the vehicle provides the commander faster feedback and the capability to cover large areas.    Vehicles provide the R&S element additional protection from CBRN and conventional hazards. These advantages depend on the specific vehicle employed. Reconnaissance vehicles can include the following:   Armor protection.   Enhanced navigation and communications capability.   Enhanced optics.   Limited firepower.   Collective protection.   Meteorological data.   Amphibious capability.   Remaining  mounted  allows  the  R&S  element  to  conduct  detailed  CBRN  reconnaissance while  maintaining  the  speed  and  momentum  required  for  the  CBRN  reconnaissance operation. Increased mobility in open terrain.  D-4.  The following are advantages of CBRN R&S: 25 March 2013 FM 3-19.40 D-1 Appendix D   Loss of stealth due to the visual, noise, and thermal signatures of vehicles.   Loss of accuracy to pinpoint actual contamination.   Higher probability of false positives.   Higher probability of false negatives.   Decontamination requirements for personnel and vehicles.    CBRN  reconnaissance  vehicles  are  often  not  equipped  with  dismounted  reconnaissance Increased decontamination and disposal requirements. capabilities for buildings or other places not accessible by vehicles. PLANNING D-5.  Planning  for  CBRN  R&S  operations  has  been  discussed  previously  in  chapter  2  and  appendix  B. There are key planning factors that must be considered when planning for mounted CBRN reconnaissance. UNDERSTANDING THE MISSION D-6.  When given the mission, it is imperative that the CBRN R&S element fully understands the mission and the tasks associated with it. Many times a single word in a mission statement implies very complex TTP.  Words  such  as  confirm  or  deny  can  be  insignificant  compared  to  words  such  as  “exploit”  and characterize. A thorough task analysis is imperative when planning mounted CBRN R&S operations. PRIORITY INTELLIGENCE REQUIREMENTS D-7.  The  CBRN  R&S  element  must  understand  what  information  is  important  to  the  commander. Although most information has value to someone, the CBRN R&S element must key in on the information the commander has deemed priority. For instance, a mounted CBRN R&S element could be sent along a MSR on a route reconnaissance mission using a lane technique in order to determine if an adversary has contaminated a critical logistics asset. D-8.  The  commander  provides  success  criteria  for  each  mission  in  terms  of  measures  of  performance (MOP). Success can be gauged using MOP at the tactical level. MOP are used to assess friendly actions that  are  tied  to  measuring  task  accomplishment.  A  CBRN  reconnaissance  mission  can  be  considered successful  when  the  CBRN  R&S  element  reports  what  it  has  found  prior  to  the  LTIOV.  If  required  to provide samples as a measure of performance, success can be when the CBRN R&S element successfully transfers its samples to a receiving party (for example, TE, laboratory, or courier). PREPARING D-9.  Preparation for CBRN R&S  missions has been covered in chapter 3 and appendix C. Key factors when preparing for a mounted CBRN mission are discussed in the following paragraphs. COORDINATION D-10. Coordination with other elements is paramount to making the mission successful. Capabilities such as security, decontamination, sample transfer and transport, and communications can all play an important role in the success of a mounted CBRN reconnaissance mission success. Coordinate for contingencies such as encountering adversaries, encountering hazards such as IEDs, and medical evacuation. See chapter 3 for further discussion on coordination and preparation activities.  EQUIPMENT PREPARATION D-11. Effective identification of key equipment to perform the mounted CBRN reconnaissance mission is critical to the success of the CBRN R&S operation. Taking the wrong equipment, not preparing equipment properly  (for  example,  performing  PMCS  on  CBRN  R&S  platforms),  insufficient  protective  equipment, and inappropriate sample collection equipment are examples of things that can cause a CBRN mission to fail.  D-2 ATP 3-11.37 25 March 2013 Mounted Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Reconnaissance and Surveillance D-12. Determining if a CBRN R&S element is prepared for its mission is a commander’s decision and is based on his level of acceptable risk. Very rarely is an element 100 percent prepared for every aspect of a mission. As long as any perceived risks that exist are acceptable to the commander, then the mission should be executed. (Refer to chapter 3.) EXECUTING D-13. Executing  mounted  CBRN  R&S  operations  should  be  conducted  in  a  deliberate  and  controlled manner to ensure safety and success of the mission. Table D-1 provides an example of some procedures associated with executing mounted CBRN R&S operations. These steps are divided into phases for ease in understanding and, eventually, execution. Note. Not all of the steps and supporting tasks in table D-1 are required in support of CBRN R&S procedures. Table D-1.

Transfer samples and material if collected.  OCCUPY AN ASSEMBLY AREA IN THE VICINITY OF THE RECONNAISSANCE AND SURVEILLANCE MISSION D-14. A CBRN R&S element should approach a CBRN survey area from upwind. The element will stop prior to actually entering the suspect area or point to set up its operations. The distance from the actual reconnaissance site is determined by various factors such as, local weather data/conditions and geography (altitude), terrain, suspected agent, and security concerns. Guidance may be given by the higher command, but  normally  this  distance  is  in  element  SOPs  and  may  be  based  on  standoff  distance  provided  in  the Department of Transportation (DOT), Emergency Response Guidebook, 2008, or other such documents.  D-15. The CBRN R&S element leader and assistant element leader will conduct a leader’s reconnaissance and initial assessment of the area, identify the location of security forces (if required), and acquire overall situational awareness. This is conducted from the operational area to help develop the plan before the initial survey. Details include identify a potentially safe route and describe the area (obstacles, types of containers, azimuths (including area location), and potential hazards) with photographs, sketches, and distances. The 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 D-3 Appendix D command post (CP) location will also serve as the element staging area. The CBRN R&S element leader will also designate general area for the decontamination station, entry and exit locations, and select one or more rally points. D-16. Once mission command/C2 is established and all the steps and tasks in table D-1, page D-3, have been accomplished to occupy the assembly area, the mission command/C2 element—   Obtains information relating to the area and weather conditions.  Prepares a downwind hazard plot using DOT, Emergency Response Guidebook, 2008, or another method.   Establishes staging areas upon approach (upwind and upgrade whenever possible) for arriving personnel.    Designates a tactical radio frequency to be used.   Establishes CP location upwind/upgrade and at a safe distance from the area in a place away from direct involvement with casualties and personnel. Identifies the location of CP and staging areas for follow-on units. Initiates accountability system for all involved. (May need to assign an accountability officer.)    Coordinates with security.    Ensures security sweeps the area for secondary devices at the CP and staging areas.   Establishes minimum protective posture for all personnel in the area.    Establishes  and  maintains  direct  communications  with  all  elements  such  as,  decontamination Formulates plan and disseminates to all sectors. element, sample collection element, security element, and others as necessary.   Determines protective action distances if required.    Has common radio channels/frequencies assigned to sectors to improve operational control and efficiency. Schedules periodic situation briefings.   Establishes contaminated waste area.   Makes arrangements for replacement of contaminated protective clothing.    Reviews and reevaluates personal protective levels.   Maintains a log of incident operations.   Establishes personnel accountability.    Notifies  the  local/HN  authorities  of  the  protective  action  distances  that  extend  into  civilian Initiates air monitoring. sectors if required.   Establishes water supply, hose lines, and suppression as appropriate.   Notifies supporting medical personnel of the potential for receiving CBRN casualties.   Monitors (controls, if possible) water runoff.  Issues access credentials if needed.  CONDUCT INITIAL AREA SURVEY D-17. It  is  critical  to  survey  the  overall  area  since  intelligence  analysis  and  information  reporting  only provides  an  idea  of  what  the  target  is  and  its  composition.  No  intelligence  is  100  percent  accurate  and conducting  an  overall  initial  area  survey  will  provide  the  R&S  element  an  understanding  of  the  current status of the area. D-18. The key tasks accomplished during the initial area survey are listed below in priority order:   Determine radiological levels.   Determine and revaluate the appropriate IPE/PPE.   Reevaluate protective posture for R&S element.   Determine the priority of effort. D-4 ATP 3-11.37 25 March 2013 Mounted Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Reconnaissance and Surveillance  Prepare an area sketch to include determining the Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates and other location identifying information (for example, street addresses). D-19. The initial area survey could be a relatively rapid task or a more prolonged task, depending on the size  and  complexity  of  the  area.  Decisions  can  be  made  regarding  the  appropriate  level  of  IPE/PPE  for follow-on R&S elements collecting samples or conducting presumptive or field confirmatory identification. During initial survey observations—   Look for anything obvious while securing and during initial survey of area.   Determine if CBRN agents are being produced, stored, or weaponized in the area.   Be alert for booby traps/IEDs.   Note instrument readings and/or detections. D-20. When a suspicious item is encountered, the entry R&S element must first assess the “big picture,” look  for  all  hazards  before  proceeding,  document  its  location  and  the  surrounding  area,  and  finally, determine  if  it  is  an  item  of  interest.  Is  this  item  CBRN-related  and was  it  expected or not? If  it  is  not CBRN, is it hazardous and does it pose a threat? D-21. When approaching the item of interest— Photograph/document the undisturbed item.    Determine if the item recognizable?   Move toward the item.   Watch for dangers.   Record all actions with the item.  Initiate detection procedures. D-22. If possible, the survey R&S element should sketch out the structure as they move through it. This may  be  difficult  given  a  complex  structure,  but  it  will  allow  the  R&S  element  to  better  document  their findings  and  develop  the  sample  management  plan.  It  also  provides  better  clarity  to  those  reading  the assessment report. SAMPLE MANAGEMENT PLAN D-23. The development of a sample management plan is discussed in appendix H. SAMPLE COLLECTION D-24. Sample collection TTP are discussed in appendix H. EXIT PROCEDURES/DECONTAMINATION D-25. Prior  to  exiting  the  area,  the  CBRN  R&S  element  must  communicate  ahead  so  that  the decontamination personnel are prepared to receive them.  D-26. The method of decontamination is determined based on the time available, threat level, and IPE/PPE worn. As a minimum, decontamination of boots/footgear is necessary for all personnel and equipment.  D-27. If the situation is permissive and the CBRN R&S element is supported by a decontamination unit, a thorough  decontamination  operation  should  be  undertaken.  This  will  limit  the  possible  spread  of contamination  and  negate  the  need  for  further  decontamination  operations.  See  MultiService  Tactics, Techniques,  and  Procedures  for  Chemical,  Biological,  Radiological,  and  Nuclear  Decontamination  for more information. PACKAGING/DOCUMENTATION/TRANSPORT D-28. Sample packaging, documentation, and transport are discussed in appendix G. 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 D-5 Appendix D REPORTING  D-29. Reporting should normally occur as a two-part process:   Initial assessment report. The first report of the initial findings will occur upon completion of the mission or upon identification of PIR. Reporting of an identified PIR will occur immediately when found. Suspect  area  survey  report.  The  final  postmission  report  will  be  delivered  to  the  higher headquarters,  normally  within  48  hours  unless  otherwise  specified  in  the  order,  SOPs,  or command guidance. The report format can be found in appendix H.  MOUNTED CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR RECONNAISSANCE OPERATIONS D-30. Mounted CBRN reconnaissance provides the tactical commander the ability to use speed when time is critical. The key tasks for mounted CBRN reconnaissance are detect, locate, identify, quantify, collect samples, survey, mark, and report. (Detailed information on sample collection is located in appendix G, reporting  in  appendix  H,  and  marking  in  appendix  I.)  The  commander  considers  the  factors  of  METT-TC/METT-T  to  determine  whether  to  conduct  mounted  reconnaissance.  A  mounted  reconnaissance  is conducted when—   Time constraints based on METT-TC/METT-T.   Detailed reconnaissance is not required (for example, complete survey).   Air units are available to perform coordinated reconnaissance with the ground assets.    The IPOE/IPB process has provided detailed information on the adversary.   Terrain  is  relatively  open  (for  example,  roadways  or  axis  is  capable  of  sustaining  type  and weight of vehicle used for the reconnaissance).   Environmental  conditions  permit  this  type  of  reconnaissance  (deep  snow  and  muddy  terrain greatly hinder mounted reconnaissance).   Dismounted reconnaissance cannot complete the mission within existing time constraints, and a mounted reconnaissance can.   Mounted reconnaissance, with built-in collective protection, provides a degree of protection to reconnaissance personnel not afforded by dismounted reconnaissance. D-31. During  mounted  reconnaissance  operations,  the  commander  may  direct  a  CBRN  R&S  element  to conduct a route, zone, or area reconnaissance mission. Time is the critical factor for the mission; however, mounted operations reduce the time and mitigate the effects of CBRN hazards. Mounted reconnaissance generally requires more decontamination assets than dismounted reconnaissance to accomplish operational decontamination. Decontamination can be a resource intensive operation and is typically conducted in a permissive environment. The aim is to gather information on the actual extent of the contamination to aid commanders  in  their  decisions  and  to  prevent  U.S.  and  allied  forces  from  unknowingly  entering  the contaminated  area.  Surveys  require  applied  judgment  based  on  METT-TC/METT-T.  The  mission,  the terrain, and the adversary dictate which survey technique should be used. The detection equipment used to conduct surveys varies based on the situation and the threat. Equipment and system operating instructions are  found  in  applicable operator  and  crew service  and  technical publications. A  complete  survey occurs when the entire extent of the contamination has been identified. An incomplete survey occurs when the entire extent of the contamination has not been identified, such as when a survey to find a bypass route is conducted.  D-32. The procedures associated with CBRN surveys are—   Locate the general boundaries of the contaminated area.  Place  warning  markers  at  specified  intervals  around  the  contaminated  area  and  at  all  entry points.   Determine the intensity of the contamination.   Report information using the CBRN4 report. D-6 ATP 3-11.37 25 March 2013 Mounted Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Reconnaissance and Surveillance D-33. Commanders may use one of three forms of CBRN mounted reconnaissance, or a combination of the three. The three forms of CBRN mounted reconnaissance are route, area, and zone. ROUTE D-34. Route reconnaissance (figure D-1) is a form of reconnaissance that focuses along a specific line of communications,  logistics,  and  travel  (a  road,  railway,  cross-country  mobility  corridor).  CBRN  route reconnaissance  provides  new  or  updated  information  on  route  conditions  such  as,  obstacles  and  bridge classifications, and adversary and civilian activity along the route. A route reconnaissance includes not only the route itself, but also all terrain along the route from which the adversary could influence the movement of friendly forces. Legend: LD PL line of departure phase line Figure D-1. CBRN route reconnaissance D-35. The  commander  normally  assigns  this  mission  when  he  wants  to  use  a  specific  route  for  friendly forces  movement.  When  the  commander’s  IPOE/IPB  indicates  that  there  is  a  high  likelihood  of contamination along the route, a unit (particularly a CBRN R&S element) is given the specific mission to conduct a CBRN route reconnaissance. The CBRN route reconnaissance proceeds faster than a CBRN zone reconnaissance.  The  route  length  and  the  time  available  dictate  the  size  of  the  R&S  element.  Once contamination is detected, the R&S element has the following options:   Conduct a CBRN survey to define the boundaries of the contamination to determine the extent of contamination.   Locate  and  mark  clear  bypass  routes.  (This  does  not  require  determining  the  entire  extent  of contamination.)   Report and mark CBRN hazards along the route. D-36. The following critical tasks are conducted during a route reconnaissance:   Reconnoiter terrain along the route.   Locate and mark the near side and far side of contamination on the route.   Report all information. D-37. Typical CBRN route reconnaissance procedures are—   Locate, survey, and report contamination that can influence movement along the route. 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 D-7 Appendix D   Reconnoiter terrain that the adversary can use to dominate movement along the route, such as, choke points and ambush sites within the CBRN hazard area.   Reconnoiter built-up areas, contaminated areas, and lateral routes along the route.   Locate  any  fords,  crossing  sites,  or  bypasses  for  existing  and  reinforcing  obstacles  (including built-up areas) along the route that can be used to avoid or bypass the CBRN hazard. Identify obstacles in the execution of CBRN route reconnaissance.    Report and mark CBRN hazards along the route.   Conduct CBRN survey to define the boundaries of the contamination.   Report  information  according  to  the  communication  plan  when  initiating  the  CBRN  route reconnaissance mission, including a sketch and a CBRN4 report.   Mark the contaminated area.   Request decontamination support if necessary. AREA D-38. Area  reconnaissance  (figure  D-2)  is  a  directed  effort  to  obtain  detailed  information  concerning  a specific  area,  such  as  a  terrain  feature  or  facility  (for  example,  an  adversary  storage  facility).  An  area reconnaissance is a specialized form of zone reconnaissance that proceeds faster since the effort is focused on a specific piece of terrain. Legend: LD PL line of departure phase line Figure D-2. CBRN area reconnaissance  D-39. An  area  reconnaissance  mission  is  typically  assigned  when  employing  a  CBRN  R&S  element  to reconnoiter  a  reported/suspected  CBRN  attack/hazard  in  a  specific  area.  CBRN  area  reconnaissance  is conducted  during  fixed-site  operations  (naval  seaports,  airfields,  land  component  operations).  Once contamination  is  detected,  the  R&S  element  usually  performs  a  survey  to  define  the  boundaries  of  the contamination. If contamination is found, the CBRN reconnaissance unit has the following options:   Conduct a CBRN survey to determine the extent of the contamination.   Locate and mark CBRN hazards within the area.   Terminate the mission with permission of the headquarters controlling the mission. D-40. The following critical tasks are conducted during an area reconnaissance:   Reconnoiter terrain within the area.   Locate and mark CBRN hazards within the area.   Locate bypass routes around identified contaminated areas. D-8 ATP 3-11.37 25 March 2013 Mounted Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Reconnaissance and Surveillance   Report all information. D-41. The typical CBRN area reconnaissance procedures are—   Reconnoiter terrain within the area for contamination.   Check all water sources for contamination.   Locate  any  fords,  crossing  sites,  or  bypasses  for  existing  and  reinforcing  obstacles  (including built-up areas) within the area to avoid or bypass CBRN hazards. Identify all obstacles in the execution of CBRN area reconnaissance.    Report and mark CBRN hazards within the area.   Locate and mark bypass routes if contamination is encountered.   Report  information  according  to  the  communication  plan  when  initiating  the  CBRN  area reconnaissance mission.   Conduct  CBRN  survey  to  define  the  boundaries  of  the  contamination  (a  sketch,  a  CBRN4 report).   Mark contaminated area.   Request decontamination support if necessary ZONE D-42. Zone reconnaissance, figure D-3, is a form of reconnaissance that involves a directed effort to obtain detailed information on routes, obstacles, terrain, and adversary forces within a zone defined by boundaries. Obstacles include existing and reinforcing, and areas containing CBRN hazards. Legend: LD LOA PL line of departure limit of advance phase lineFigure D-3. CBRN zone reconnaissance  D-43. The commander assigns a zone reconnaissance mission when additional information is needed in a zone  before  committing  other  forces  to  occupy  or  pass  through  the  zone.  Zone  reconnaissance  is appropriate when the adversary situation is vague, existing knowledge of the terrain is limited, or combat operations have altered the terrain. A commander will make the decision to conduct a zone reconnaissance based upon the organic assets or additional assets from higher headquarters. A zone reconnaissance may include several route or area reconnaissance missions assigned to subordinate units. A zone reconnaissance is a deliberate, time-consuming process that requires a substantial expenditure of resources. Typically, a zone  reconnaissance  is  performed  to  determine  the  suitability  for  large  unit  assembly  areas  or  logistics bases.  Previous  reports  or  intelligence  may  indicate  a  high  probability  of  past  CBRN  attacks  within  the zone. Once contamination is detected, the R&S element has the following options:   Conduct a CBRN survey to define the boundaries of the contamination. 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 D-9 Appendix D   Locate and mark clean bypass routes around the contaminated area within the zone.   Terminate the mission, and move to the coordinated decontamination point. D-44. Unless specifically directed by the commander, critical tasks must be accomplished during a zone reconnaissance. The commander may direct the reconnaissance toward specific IR only, based on the time available and his intent. The following critical tasks are conducted during a zone reconnaissance:   Reconnoiter terrain within the zone for contamination.   Locate previously reported CBRN attack areas, and determine if there is still a hazard.   Locate possible contamination within the zone.   Check  water  sources  for  contamination  (for  example,  conduct  sample  collection  and  forward samples for testing).   Verify  the  location  of  commercial  toxic  industrial  material  (TIM)  facilities,  and  check  for possible contamination.   Report information.   Mark contaminated areas.   Locate routes to bypass contamination. D-45. The typical zone reconnaissance procedures are—   Locate all previously reported CBRN attack areas and determine if there is still a hazard.   Reconnoiter all terrain within the zone for contamination.   Check all water sources for contamination.   Locate  any  fords,  crossing  sites,  or  bypasses  for  existing  and  reinforcing  obstacles  (including built-up areas) within the zone to avoid or bypass CBRN hazards. Identify all obstacles in the execution of CBRN zone reconnaissance.    Report and mark all CBRN hazards within the zone.   Locate and mark bypass routes if contamination is encountered.   Conduct a CBRN survey to define the boundaries of the contamination.   Report  information  according  to  the  communication  plan  when  initiating  the  CBRN  zone reconnaissance mission, including a sketch and CBRN4 report.   Mark contaminated areas.   Request decontamination support if necessary. MOUNTED CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR RECONNAISSANCE TACTICAL FORMATIONS D-46.  The CBRN R&S element uses standard movement formations and techniques to get to its assigned area. Once at the mission area, the R&S element selects the appropriate CBRN survey technique to perform its  mission.  CBRN  reconnaissance  leaders  must  exercise  mission  command/C2,  maximize  the  use  of terrain, and apply the following fundamentals of movement:   Move on covered and concealed routes.   Do not move directly forward from covered and concealed positions.   Avoid likely ambush sites and other danger areas.   Enforce camouflage, noise, and light discipline.   Maintain all-around security, including air guards.   Use terrain for protection.   Avoid possible kill zones.   Maximize vehicle capabilities such as collective protection and standoff detections systems. D-47. There  are  five  formations  for  mounted  reconnaissance  movement—column,  staggered  column, wedge, V, and echelon. D-10 ATP 3-11.37 25 March 2013 Mounted Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Reconnaissance and Surveillance COLUMN D-48. The  column  formation,  figure  D-4,  is  used  for  rapid  movement  when  time  is  limited;  however,  it provides little flank security. This formation is primarily used when no adversary contact is expected and time is critical. Figure D-4. Column formation  STAGGERED COLUMN D-49. The  column  formation  is  used  for  road  marches,  for  reconnaissance  movement  during  limited visibility, and when passing through defiles or other restrictive terrain. The unit can deploy rapidly from the column formation into other formations, and the column formation simplifies control and provides good security. The staggered column formation, figure D-5 is used for rapid movement across open terrain. It affords all-round observation and fields of fire. The unit leader positions himself to best control the unit. Reconnaissance vehicles should maintain 25- to 100-meter intervals and lateral dispersion. Each vehicle commander maintains observation of his designated sector. The exact distance between vehicles depends on METT-TC/METT-T, weather conditions, and visibility. Figure D-5. Staggered column formation  WEDGE  D-50. The  wedge  formation,  figure  D-6,  page  D-12,  is  one  of  the  most  frequently  used  unit  movement formations.  It  allows  for  optimum  flexibility  and  security  and  facilitates  mission  command/C2.  Vehicle dispersion and intervals depend on METT-TC/METT-T and visibility. When spreading out in open, flat terrain, each vehicle operator must maintain visibility of the vehicle in front of him. Each reconnaissance vehicle commander maintains observation of a designated sector. A column of wedges formation is used when adversary contact is possible (figure D-7, page D-12). It is best employed when traveling or traveling overwatch conditions are warranted. 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 D-11 Appendix D Figure D-6. Wedge formation    Figure D-7. Column of wedges formation V FORMATION D-51. The V formation (figure D-8) affords good security, speed, and mission command/C2. The split V formation (figure D-9) can be used when two units are operating on different routes. These formations are used when contact is possible, but speed is desirable. The lead V R&S element moves along covered and concealed  routes  for  protection.  The  trail  R&S  element  moves  at  a  variable  speed,  continually overwatching and providing security. The trail R&S element must always maintain visual contact with the lead R&S element and may stop periodically to observe. Figure D-8. V formation  D-12 ATP 3-11.37 25 March 2013 Mounted Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Reconnaissance and Surveillance  Figure D-9. Split V formation  ECHELON (LEFT OR RIGHT) D-52. The echelon formation (figure D-10) provides coverage of an area. It provides flexibility and speed, but does not provide sufficient security if adversary contact is possible or expected. Note. Echelon right mirrors the formation of echelon left. Figure D-10. Echelon left  SUPPORT AREA D-53. The  ability  to  sustain  combat  operations  in  the  support  area  is  vital  to  operational  success.  If contaminated by attack, organizations identify clear areas and move to a predesignated area to avoid CBRN hazards effects.   Organizations  at  fixed  sites  may  fall  within  the  range  of  adversary  air  and  surface  weapon delivery systems armed with CBRN weapons or industrial storage facilities with TIM.   The  areas  of  greatest  vulnerability  are  large  fixed  sites  (for  example,  ports  of  debarkation), staging  and  marshaling  areas,  hubs, bases, assembly  areas,  MSRs,  and sites  involved in  early force buildup activities. MOUNTED CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR LOCATE TECHNIQUES D-54. CBRN locate techniques are conducted to locate suspected or actual CBRN agents or hazards from an attack within the AOR. CBRN locate is conducted on a continuous basis to detect hazards along routes, in areas, or in selected zones or sectors of interest. Locate techniques can use point or standoff capabilities 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 D-13 Appendix D to find contaminated areas. CBRN locate techniques require applied judgment based on METT-TC/METT-T. The terrain and the adversary dictate which technique to use and the level of detail possible. More than one  technique  may  be  executed  during  a  single  mission.  There  are  four  techniques  to  locate  possible contamination in the AOR. They are zigzag, lane, cloverleaf, and grid.  D-55.  Mounted  CBRN  reconnaissance  techniques  provide  advantages  and  disadvantages.  Table  D-2 provides an overview of those advantages and disadvantages. Table D-2. Mounted CBRN reconnaissance technique advantages and disadvantages Technique Speed and resources requirements Limit contamination contact Detail of results Zigzag Lane Cloverleaf Nearside-farside Box Bounce-and-bypass Star Grid Course leg Preselected dose rate Fair Fair Fair Poor Poor Fair Good Poor Good Good Fair Fair Fair Poor Good Good Poor Fair Good Good Good Poor Poor Good Good Fair Fair Good Good Good Good = Area covered with a low amount of travel, personnel, and detection points Fair = Area covered with a moderate amount of travel, personnel, and detection points Poor = Area covered with a large amount of travel, personnel, and detection points Good = Does not continue through contaminated area Good = All contamination boundary limits found Fair = Does not return through contaminated area Fair = Some of the contamination boundary limits found Poor = Returns through contaminated area Poor = Contamination only generally located D-56. Terrain  analysis  may  be  used  to  determine  the  appropriate  technique  to  be  applied  to  the  specific mission. For example, the zigzag locate technique may not be appropriate in urban areas, but the lane locate technique allows the CBRN R&S element to use roadways that are generally parallel. ZIGZAG D-57. The zigzag locate technique (figure D-11) is used to locate contaminated areas during route, zone, or area  reconnaissance  missions.  Depending  on  the  terrain,  the  distances  could  be  larger  or  smaller.  The zigzag locate technique has a higher probability of detecting contamination because the surface area not traversed by the R&S element is less than that of other locate techniques. The following are procedures for the zigzag locate technique:   The R&S element begins its assessment at the deployment (start) line, maintaining 200-meter intervals between vehicles.   The R&S element moves forward along a line that is oriented 45° from the start line.   The R&S element monitors identification equipment for indications of contamination.   After the R&S element has moved 500 meters along the first zig, it turns 90° and zags. D-14 ATP 3-11.37 25 March 2013 Mounted Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Reconnaissance and Surveillance   After traveling 500 meters, it turns 90° for a second zig.  Note. Depending on the terrain, the distances could be larger or smaller.   The R&S element continues to zigzag until it has reached its limit of advance.    Once the entire mission area has been assessed, the R&S element reports the results normally using the CBRN4 report. If the R&S element did not assess the entire mission area, it begins a new sweep.    The R&S element repeats the process until contamination is detected or the entire mission area is assessed. Figure D-11. Zigzag locate technique  LANE D-58. The lane locate technique (figure D-11) is used to locate contaminated areas. It is very similar to the zigzag locate technique, but is primarily used during route reconnaissance missions. It can also be used for area reconnaissance of long, narrow pieces of terrain, such as defiles. The following are procedures for the lane locate technique:   The  R&S  element  begins  its  assessment  at  the  LD  with  an  interval  of  less  than  200  meters between vehicles.   The R&S element moves in a staggered column formation.   Each R&S element moves along a line until it reaches the limit of advance.   The R&S element begins a new sweep and repeats the process until contamination is detected or the entire mission area is assessed, if the R&S element did not assess the entire mission area. If contamination is found on a route, create and submit a CBRN4 report and continue lane.    Once the entire mission area has been assessed, the R&S element reports the results. 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 D-15 Appendix D Figure D-11. Lane locate technique  CLOVERLEAF D-59. The cloverleaf locate technique is primarily used in restricted access or terrain or so that sites for high-value facilities (mission command, centers, are free of contamination. The cloverleaf locate technique is  time-consuming;  however,  it  provides  detailed  coverage  and  information  about  an  area.  The  path  to travel is illustrated in figure D-13 reading intervals are determined by the terrain and information outlined in the OPORD. The following are procedures for the cloverleaf locate technique:   The R&S element begins its cloverleaf at a starting point central to the area to be checked.   The R&S element moves in a figure-8 pattern using the start point as the center of the 8. If a second vehicle is used, the second vehicle conducts the same pattern moving 90º direction from the first vehicle. If only one vehicle is conducting the cloverleaf, it completes one figure 8 and then conducts a second figure 8 at a 90º angle from the first figure 8.   The R&S element monitors identification equipment for indications of contamination.   The R&S element can conduct continuous monitoring along its route, or if rough terrain, it will conduct checks at set intervals along its route.  Note. Depending on the terrain, the distances could be larger or smaller.   The R&S element reports the results by using the CBRN4 report.   A new cloverleaf is begun within the area, if the R&S element did not assess the entire mission area. D-16 ATP 3-11.37 25 March 2013 Mounted Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Reconnaissance and Surveillance   The R&S element repeats the process until contamination is detected or the entire mission area is assessed. Figure D-12. Cloverleaf locate technique  GRID D-60. The  grid  technique  is  employed  by  R&S  elements  conducting  mounted  reconnaissance,  where accuracy is important. It is employed by superimposing a grid over the R&S element maps, which enables them to rapidly communicate locations for detections, where samples were collected, and the locations of casualties.  Numbers  and/or  letters  are  assigned  to  each  detection  point  associated  with  a  predetermined GPS location. (See figure D-13.) Figure D-13.

The following are procedures for the grid technique:   The CBRN R&S element establishes the boundaries of the area to be checked.   The CBRN R&S element preselects points within the area that it will check for contamination.   Normally the points to be checked are laid out in an evenly spaced grid pattern.   The CBRN R&S element conducts checks at each point within the grid.   The CBRN R&S element reports the results, normally by using a CBRN4 report.   The CBRN R&S element coordinates for decontamination.   The CBRN R&S element may transition to a CBRN survey if contamination is found MOUNTED CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR SURVEY TECHNIQUES D-62. CBRN  surveys  define  the  boundaries  of  contaminated  areas.  CBRN  survey  techniques  require applied  judgment  based  on  METT-TC/METT-T.  The  mission,  terrain,  time,  and  adversary  situation indicate the technique that should be used. There are six survey techniques that can be employed once the contamination is located—nearside-farside, box, star, bounce-and-bypass, course leg, and preselected dose rate.  D-63. CBRN  survey  techniques  can  be  conducted  by  a  mounted  or  dismounted  R&S  element.  The distances suggested for each technique vary depending on METT-TC/METT-T.  NEARSIDE-FARSIDE D-64. The nearside-farside survey technique (figure D-14) is used by an R&S element whenever they enter the contaminated area. It is possible that the left and right limits of the contamination are not identified, even though the left and right R&S elements determined a nearside and a farside. In this case, the R&S element can shift to the left and right to find the boundaries. The lateral spacing between R&S elements is important to quickly locate all boundaries of the contaminated area. Once the boundaries are located, clear bypass routes can be easily established.  D-65. The following are procedures for the nearside-farside survey technique:   All vehicles stop to determine if the R&S element is in the contaminated area.  If an R&S element is in the contaminated area, it moves back along its original path every 200 meters and checks for contamination until CBRN contamination is no longer detected.   Once out of the contaminated area, appropriate warning markers are emplaced.   Once  the  initial  vehicle  or  individual  has  found  the  nearside  boundary  of  contamination,  it moves forward across the contaminated area, testing every 200 meters.   When contamination is no longer detected, the R&S element moves forward another 200 meters and checks again. If no contamination is detected, it places a CBRN warning marker.    This process is repeated until it is clear of the contamination.   Using multiple vehicles, each R&S element executes this process to determine the nearside and farside boundaries of the contamination. D-18 ATP 3-11.37 25 March 2013 Mounted Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Reconnaissance and Surveillance Figure D-14. Nearside-farside survey technique  BOX D-66. The  box  survey  technique  (figure  D-15,  page  D-20)  is  used  to  determine  the  general  dimensions (length  and  width)  of  a  contaminated  area.  The  CBRN  reconnaissance  vehicle  crew  uses  the  decision matrix  to  determine  which  direction  and  distance  to  proceed.  The  R&S  elements  start  a  parallel  course toward  the  suspected  contamination  along  predetermined  grid  squares,  conducting  sample  collection  at each grid intersection. If the length of the reconnaissance area is covered without finding contamination, the R&S elements should increase the distance between them and return in the same direction. This can continue until the entire area is covered, or contamination is found. The following are box survey technique procedures:   The R&S elements stop and check for contamination in their immediate areas.   The first R&S element to report contamination becomes the base element.  If  any  other  R&S  element  is  located  in  the  contaminated  area,  they  must  back  out  of  the contamination.   Other R&S elements should orient on the base element.   At least one R&S element should be to the left and one element to the right of the base element.   When contamination is found, a CBRN4 report is generated and the R&S element turns 180° and returns to a grid intersection.   A CBRN marker is placed if the grid intersection is far enough away from the contamination. (If not, the R&S element moves out further to place CBRN marker.)   The left element turns 90° to the right and bounds to the next grid intersection to determine the extent of the contamination. (Conversely, the right element turns 90° to the left and bounds to the next grid intersection to determine the extent of the contamination.)   This process is continued until the presence of, or the extent of, contamination is confirmed and until the elements meet. Note. The movement of the R&S element depends on the orientation of the contaminated area.   This process of going straight or turning continues in a boxlike movement until the R&S element has crossed the initial farside line; this is the initial right limit of the contamination. 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 D-19 Appendix D Figure D-15. Box survey technique  STAR D-67. The  star  survey  technique  (figure  D-16)  is  a  very  quick  way  to  determine  the  rough  limits  of  a contaminated area. Use the star technique to get the CBRN R&S element in and out of the contaminated area in the shortest possible time. The following are procedures for the star survey techniques procedures:   The  R&S  element  that  encounters  the  contamination  moves  their  vehicle  back  from  the contaminated area 200 meters from the initial positive reading.    This point is the base of the star.   The  R&S  element  posts  a  CBRN  marker  and  proceeds  forward  to  find  the  farside,  detecting every 200 meters until no contamination is detected.   The  R&S  element  proceeds  another  200  meters,  checks  again  so  that  no  contamination  is detected, and posts a CBRN marker.    This ends the first leg of the star.   The R&S element turns about 135° and travels in that direction, detecting every 200 meters.  If no contamination is detected on this leg, the R&S element does not travel any longer than the length of the initial leg.    The R&S element repeats this process until it arrives at or near the base of the star.   The R&S element reports the results normally using a CBRN4 report showing the five points of the star.   This  technique  can  be  used  by  two  or  more  R&S  elements  to  obtain  more  detecting  points, increasing the accuracy of the survey. D-20 ATP 3-11.37 25 March 2013 Mounted Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Reconnaissance and Surveillance Figure D-16. Star survey technique  BOUNCE-AND-BYPASS The bounce-and-bypass survey technique (figure D-17, page D-22) is used to locate the general boundaries of a CBRN contaminated area. The R&S element places CBRN markers at specified intervals around the contaminated area and at all entry points. This technique can also be used to support a radiological survey. The  R&S  element  reports  the  intensity  of  radiation  at  the  contamination  boundary.  The  following  are procedures for the bounce-and-bypass survey technique:   The R&S element stops and checks for contamination in their immediate area.  If  no  contamination  is  detected,  the  R&S  element  proceeds  forward  until  contamination  is detected.   Once  contamination  is  detected,  the  R&S  element  proceeds  out  of  the  contaminated  area  and places a CBRN marker where no contamination is found.   The R&S element proceeds along a general axis, moving in the appropriate cardinal direction away from the initial start point at least 200 meters or as prescribed in the OPORD.   The R&S element then turns in the same cardinal direction toward the contaminated area until contamination is detected again.    Once  contamination  is  detected,  the  R&S  element  proceeds  out  of  the  contaminated  area  and places a CBRN marker where no contamination is found.   This process will continue until no contamination is found.   A CBRN4 report is submitted. 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 D-21 Appendix D Figure D-17. Bounce-and-bypass survey technique  COURSE LEG D-68. The course leg technique is used primarily during aerial reconnaissance (see appendix F) but may be conducted  mounted.  The  course  leg  technique  is  used  to  find  the  extent  and  intensity  of  radiological contamination. The CBRN R&S element moves between two checkpoints; for example, from Point A (top of a hill) to Point B (top of another hill). Readings are taken at given intervals along the route between the two checkpoints. When conducting a mounted radiological course leg, the element must be given a turn-back dose  and  turn-back  dose  rate.  Reporting  results  of  mounted  course  leg  techniques  may  be  done  in various ways. Normally a survey data sheet can be filled out and turned in to the tasking headquarters at the end of the mission or the data can be sent via a CBRN4 report. Figure D-18 outlines and illustrates the course leg technique.  Note. Conducting mounted versus aerial radiological course legs results in higher radiation doses to personnel. Further guidance on radiological aspect of conducting a course leg technique can be  found  in  MultiService  Tactics,  Techniques,  and  Procedures  for  Chemical,  Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Contamination Avoidance. D-69. The following are procedures for the course leg survey:   The CBRN R&S element reads the survey meter and records the dose rate at the start point of the course leg.   The CBRN R&S element reads the survey meter and records the dose rate at each preselected interval along the course leg. Under no circumstances should the element continue further into a contaminated area if it reaches its turn-back dose or turn-back dose rate.   The CBRN R&S element reads the survey meter and records the dose rate at the end point of the course leg.   The CBRN R&S element reports the results using the CBRN4 report.   The CBRN R&S element coordinates for decontamination.   The  CBRN  R&S  element  rechecks  and  zeros  the  RADIAC  meter  before  each  course  leg  to assure proper operation. D-22 ATP 3-11.37 25 March 2013 Mounted Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Reconnaissance and Surveillance Figure D-18. Course leg technique  PRESELECTED DOSE RATE D-70. Preselected dose rate techniques are used as a form of route technique where the R&S element is sent along a route and told to report and or mark at preselected dose rates. This is used for radiological surveys and, once multiple preselected dose routes have been conducted, the points can be correlated to show the contour lines of radiological contamination fallout. Figure D-19, page D-24, provides an example.  MOUNTED CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR SURVEILLANCE  D-71. Reconnaissance  is  the  first  step  in  CBRN  surveillance  site  selection.  Begin  with  a  map reconnaissance.  Use  the  map  reconnaissance  to  determine  initial  surveillance  areas  that  support  the employment  tactic,  and  then  select  primary,  alternate,  and  supplemental  surveillance  sites  within  each surveillance area. Some rules of thumb for the reconnaissance include:    Reconnoiter the detection and surveillance areas and potential sites firsthand, if possible.   Coordinate with the terrain owner before conducting the reconnaissance.    Ensure that the CBRN R&S element includes the designated serial leaders, including—   Observation  post  site  selection.  The  supported  unit  leader  or  the  CBRN  R&S  element leader  selects  the  general  location  for  the  observation  post  (OP).  The  leader  considers METT-TC/METT-T  factors,  the  intelligence  collection  plan,  and  the  ISR  plan  when determining the general positioning of the OP site.   Attack indicators. Agents can be disseminated by using overt or covert methods. Explosive delivery  systems  or  spray  tanks  (artillery,  rockets,  and  missiles  detonating)  have  a distinctive  visual  signature  during  the  day  and  at  night.  Aircraft  spraying  agents  have distinctive flight patterns along with the signature of the liquid being released. While these 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 D-23 Appendix D indicators  are  not  positive  proof  that  an  attack  has  occurred,  they  indicate  an  increased probability  that  it  has.  Depending  on  METT-TC/METT-T,  the  CBRN  R&S  element occupying the OP can survey the NAI to confirm or deny the presence of contamination. Figure D-19. Sample preselected dose rate technique  D-72. CBRN surveillance (figure D-20) is the systematic observation of aerospace, surface and subsurface areas, places, persons, and things by visual, aural, electronic, or other means to detect CBRN incidents and hazards.  The  key  tasks  for  CBRN  surveillance  are—observe,  monitor,  detect,  identify,  quantify,  sample collection, and report. Detailed information on sample collection is located in appendix H and on reporting information in appendix I. CBRN R&S elements monitor their areas directly or indirectly using detection capabilities  to  provide  early  warning.  CBRN  R&S  elements,  given  the  mission  to  perform  CBRN surveillance, observe specified areas for indications of CBRN incidents. This can be accomplished through direct visual means or the use of sensor and standoff capabilities. D-73. All units are trained to perform CBRN surveillance operations (for example, detector emplacement within  the  unit’s  perimeter).  They  can  also  be  given  the  mission  to  perform  CBRN  surveillance  by observing  specified  areas,  such  as  NAIs,  for  indications  of  an  attack.  The  goal  of  CBRN  surveillance operations  is  to  report  information  accurately  and  rapidly,  including  answering  the  requirements  that prompted the surveillance operation.  D-24 ATP 3-11.37 25 March 2013 Mounted Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Reconnaissance and Surveillance Legend: NAI named area of interestFigure D-20. CBRN surveillance  D-74. CBRN  surveillance  can  be  supported  by  several  systems  with  the  capabilities  of  remote  sensing, standoff chemical agent detectors, and biological point detectors that can be integrated to form a detection network. After observing the indications of a CBRN attack during CBRN surveillance, the CBRN R&S element has the following options:    Locate and mark clear bypass routes.   Terminate the mission, and move to the coordinated decontamination point.   Continue the mission.    Depending on the duration of the mission, the commander must consider sustainment of the CBRN  R&S  element  by  providing  and  maintaining  levels  of  personnel  and  materiel required while continuing the operation throughout its duration.  Personnel considerations include replacing individuals for extended durations or providing food, water, and other perishables to replenish the CBRN R&S element.    Materiel considerations include the use of standoff and remote capabilities. MOUNTED CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR OBSERVE TECHNIQUES D-75. The CBRN surveillance task of observing is accomplished by two techniques: critical node and area array. CRITICAL NODE D-76. In support areas, mounted CBRN R&S elements may be assigned CBRN surveillance missions to observe  designated  areas  for  CBRN  attacks.  MSRs  and  areas  to  be  occupied  by  logistics  and  mission command/C2 facilities may also be checked for CBRN hazards before their occupation. The following are procedures for the critical-node technique:   Occupy observation points to overwatch the designated area.   Report all indications of a CBRN attack.   Employ monitoring capabilities.   Operate and perform operator’s maintenance on CBRN monitoring equipment.   Conduct CBRN monitoring operations.  Provide data for the completion of CBRN reports. 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 D-25 Appendix D D-77. Mounted CBRN R&S elements observe specified areas or NAIs for indications of a CBRN attack. Based on IPOE/IPB and vulnerability planning, the commander prioritizes the use of available collection assets  against  designated  NAIs;  and  R&S  elements  employ  observation  and  detection  procedures  on designated areas for indications of an attack.  D-78. The primary  means of surveillance  may be from OPs. An OP is a position occupied to observe a designated area. The mounted CBRN R&S element reports any indication of a CBRN attack or adversary activity.  Another  means  of  mounted  CBRN  surveillance  is  conducting  routine  patrols  through  the operational area. This is normally conducted in support areas along MSRs and road networks.  AREA ARRAY D-79. An area array is established in order to maximize the probability of CBRN hazard detection over a large area of interest. The primary objective is to detect a hazard upwind of the operational area of concern and to provide the greatest potential warning to those in the hazard area. The specific architecture of the array is designed by the CBRN staff in close coordination with operations, intelligence, and medical staffs. Refer  to  appendix  B  for  more  specific  information  on  surveillance  planning  considerations  and  detector employment tactics. The following are area array techniques procedures:   Consider  threat,  terrain,  weather  conditions,  performance  characteristics,  and  the  quantity  of CBRN detector assets.   Determine the appropriate separation distances between CBRN detectors.   Operate and perform operator’s maintenance on CBRN monitoring equipment.    Report all indications of a CBRN attack.   Conduct CBRN monitoring operations.  Provide data for the completion of CBRN reports. MOUNTED CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR MONITOR TECHNIQUES D-80. The  CBRN  surveillance  task  of  monitoring  is  accomplished  by  two  techniques:  periodic  and continuous. PERIODIC D-81.  As the name implies, periodic monitoring is accomplished by employing CBRN detector assets at predetermined  intervals  of  time.  Prior  to  an  incident,  the  time  between  monitoring  is  determined  based primarily on the threat assessment. When intelligence estimates deem that there is a reduced likelihood of a CBRN incident, the commander is more apt to call for periodic monitoring of the area of concern. In doing so, CBRN resources (equipment and personnel) are conserved and power consumption (fuel and batteries) is reduced. D-82. Following  a  CBRN  incident,  the  periodic  monitoring  technique  may  be  utilized  over  an  extended period of time to determine whether hazardous effects remain in the area. CONTINUOUS D-83. Conversely,  the  continuous  monitoring  technique  is  accomplished  by  employing  CBRN  detector assets  uninterrupted  over  the  duration  of  the  monitoring  operations.  Similar  to  periodic  monitoring,  the threat assessment will be the prime determinant in deciding to apply the continuous monitoring technique. When an incident is anticipated, continuous monitoring provides the greatest opportunity for warning the area of concern of impending hazardous conditions. D-84. During  and  immediately  following  a  CBRN  incident,  the  continuous  monitoring  technique  is employed to note the dissipation or proliferation of the hazard area and to estimate the duration of CBRN effects. D-26 ATP 3-11.37 25 March 2013 Mounted Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Reconnaissance and Surveillance D-85. Continuous monitoring will place a much heavier burden on personnel (operators and maintainers) and  logistics  (detectors,  batteries,  fuel).  These  factors  should  be  considered  and  adequately  coordinated throughout the staff.  25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 D-27 This page intentionally left blank.    Appendix E Dismounted Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Reconnaissance and Surveillance This  appendix  provides TTP  for  leaders  and  personnel  who  are  conducting  CBRN R&S missions. It describes elements of dismounted reconnaissance (route, area, and zone)  and  how  they  are  best  performed.  This  appendix  focuses  on  ensuring  that personnel  fully  understand  the  mission  and  the  tasks  associated  with  it.  To  ensure safety and success of the mission, guidance is provided for coordination, equipment preparation,  and  execution  of  dismounted  CBRN  reconnaissance  so  that  it  will  be conducted in a deliberate and controlled manner. This appendix provides guidance on dismounted TTP for leaders and personnel who are conducting CBRN R&S missions. Dismounted reconnaissance is a mode of reconnaissance that can be conducted using any  of  the  forms  of  CBRN  reconnaissance  (route,  area,  and  zone),  while  CBRN surveillance operations utilize the various forms of CBRN surveillance (area, point, and medical). Dismounted reconnaissance is best performed for an area in which the size is conducive to military personnel operating on foot. This appendix will focus on dismounted  point  and  area  R&S  TTP,  and  provide  zone,  route,  and  standoff considerations.  Dismounted  CBRN  R&S  operations  may  be  conducted  using  a variety  of  tasks  and  techniques.  CBRN  R&S  routinely  utilizes  locate,  survey,  or monitoring  tasks  and  oftentimes  includes  more  than  one  task.  For  instance,  a dismounted CBRN R&S element may be asked to locate and determine the extent of a  contaminated  area.  They  would  first  conduct  an  assessment  of  the  given  area  to locate the contamination. Once found, the CBRN R&S element would then conduct a survey  of  the  area  to  determine  the  size  of  the  contaminated  area  and  other  key information,  such  as  the  type  of  agent  and  the  delivery  means.  Finally,  the  CBRN R&S element would monitor the contaminated area to gain an understanding of the duration of effects.  ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF DISMOUNTED CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR RECONNAISSANCE E-1.   Commanders  decide  when  to  use  dismounted  CBRN  reconnaissance  instead  of  mounted reconnaissance. Adequate time must be available to conduct a dismounted reconnaissance mission, and the commander must recognize that there is increased risk of exposure to the R&S element.  E-2.  The following are advantages of dismounted CBRN reconnaissance missions:   Allows for stealthy movement.   Allows CBRN R&S elements on foot to benefit from the concealment offered by vegetation and terrain.   Does not emit a significant visual or audio signature as do mounted reconnaissance missions.  Provides  the  ability  to  conduct  reconnaissance  operations  when  the  CBRN  hazard  is  in  close proximity to adversary positions.   Conducts reconnaissance operations in restricted terrain areas that vehicles cannot traverse.  Provides a higher confidence level in the results. 25 March 2013 FM 3-19.40 E-1 Appendix E Fatigue. E-3.  The following are disadvantages to dismounted CBRN reconnaissance missions:   A relatively slow rate of movement, increasing time to complete the mission.    Extensive requirements for detailed preliminary planning and coordination.   Considerable risk to Service members conducting dismounted CBRN reconnaissance operations.   The range of communications capabilities may be limited.   Reduced protection from—   CBRN threats/hazards.   Adversary fires.   Booby traps.  IEDs. PLANNING FOR DISMOUNTED CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR RECONNAISSANCE AND SURVEILLANCE OPERATIONS E-4.  Planning for CBRN reconnaissance has been discussed previously in chapter 2 and appendix B. The key  planning  factors  that  must  be  considered  when  planning  for  dismounted  CBRN  reconnaissance  are discussed in the following paragraphs. UNDERSTANDING THE MISSION E-5.  When given the mission, it is imperative that the CBRN R&S element fully understands the mission and the tasks associated with it. Many times a single word in a mission statement implies very complex TTP. Words  such as confirm  or deny  can  be  insignificant  when  compared  to  words such  as exploit  and characterize.  A  thorough  task  analysis  is  imperative  when  planning  dismounted  CBRN  reconnaissance operations. PRIORITY INTELLIGENCE REQUIREMENTS E-6.  The  CBRN  R&S  element  must  understand  what  information  is  important  to  the  commander. Although most information has value to someone, the CBRN R&S element must key in on the information the commander has deemed priority. For instance, a CBRN dismounted R&S element could be sent into a bunker  facility  to  conduct  a  preliminary  survey  and  provide  information  about  the  number  of  CBRN rounds, type of rounds, and their markings. E-7.  The commander provides success criteria for each mission in terms of MOP. Success can be gauged using MOP at the tactical level. MOP are used to assess friendly actions that are tied to measuring task accomplishment.  A  CBRN  reconnaissance  mission  can  be  considered  successful  when  the  CBRN  R&S element reports what it has found prior to the LTIOV. If required to provide samples as MOP, success can be when the CBRN R&S element successfully transfers its samples to a receiving party (for example, TE, laboratory, or courier). PREPARING FOR DISMOUNTED CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR RECONNAISSANCE AND SURVEILLANCE E-8.  Preparation for CBRN reconnaissance missions has been covered in chapter 3 and appendix C. Key factors when preparing for a dismounted CBRN mission are discussed in the following paragraphs. COORDINATION E-9.  Coordination with other elements is paramount to making the mission successful. Capabilities such as security, decontamination, sample transfer and transport, and communications play an important role in E-2 ATP 3-11.37 /MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 25 March 2013 Dismounted Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Reconnaissance and Surveillance the success of a dismounted CBRN reconnaissance mission. Coordination for contingencies (encountering hostiles, encountering hazards [IEDs, medical evacuation]) is discussed in chapter 3. EQUIPMENT PREPARATION E-10. Effective identification of key equipment to perform the CBRN reconnaissance mission can make or break a mission. Taking the wrong equipment, not preparing it properly (for example, no air in the self-contained  breathing  apparatus  [SCBA]  or  low  batteries),  not  enough  sample  collection  containers,  and inappropriate decontaminant are examples of things that can cause a CBRN mission to fail.  E-11. Determining if a CBRN R&S element is prepared for its mission is a commander’s decision and is based on his level of acceptable risk. Very rarely is an element 100 percent prepared for every aspect of a mission. As long as any perceived risks that exist are acceptable to the commander, then the mission should be executed. (Refer to chapter 3.) EXECUTING DISMOUNTED CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR RECONNAISSANCE AND SURVEILLANCE E-12. Executing  dismounted  CBRN  R&S  should  be  conducted  in  a  deliberate  and  controlled  manner  to ensure safety and success of the mission. Table E-1 provides an example of some procedures associated with  executing  dismounted  CBRN  R&S  operations.  These  steps  are  divided  into  phases  for  ease  in understanding and eventually, execution. Note.  Not  all  of  the  steps  and  supporting  tasks  in  table  E-1  are  required  in  support  of  all reconnaissance procedures. Table E-1.

A CBRN R&S element should approach a CBRN survey area from upwind. The element will stop prior to actually entering the suspect area or point to set up its operations. The distance from the actual site is  determined  by  various  factors  such  as  local  weather  data/conditions  and  geography  (altitude),  terrain, suspected agents, security concerns, and target size. Guidance may be given by the higher command, but normally this distance is in element SOPs and may be based on standoff distance provided in the DOT, Emergency  Response  Guidebook,  2008,  or  other  such  documents.  Once  the  standoff  (exclusion  zone) distance is determined, the R&S element moves from the assembly area to where the CP is to be set up. This may be within the avenue of approach or where the CBRN R&S element commander determines.  E-14. The CBRN R&S element leader and assistant element leader will conduct a leader’s reconnaissance and initial site assessment of the target area to ensure that they are at the proper location, to identify the location  of  security  forces  (if  required),  and  to  acquire  overall  situational  awareness.  This  is  conducted from the operational area to help develop the entry plan before the initial survey. Details include identify a potentially safe route to the target void of physical hazards, attempt to identify the target, and describe the area  (types  and  number  of  buildings,  obstacles,  types  of  containers,  azimuths  and  location  in  the  area, potential  hazards)  with  photographs,  sketches,  and  distances.  This  activity  is  conducted  while  the  CP  is setting up and the rest of the R&S element is preparing their mission equipment. The key task during this reconnaissance is to determine the general location of the working zones (cold, warm, and hot) and select the  location  of  the  CP.  The  CP  location  will  also  serve  as  the  element  staging  area.  The  CBRN  R&S element  leader  will  designate  a  general  area  for  the  decontamination  station  identity,  entry  and  exit locations, and select one or more rally points. E-4 ATP 3-11.37 /MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 25 March 2013 Dismounted Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Reconnaissance and Surveillance E-15. A “hot line” is established that identifies the transition between the “hot zone” and “warm zone.” This line is also referred to as the “liquid control line.” The area between the cold zone and the hot zone is considered the “warm zone” and the line that transitions from the “warm zone” to the “cold zone” is also referred  to  as  the  “vapor  control  line.”  A  majority  of  the  decontamination  process  occurs  in  the  “warm zone.”  After  the  establishment  of  the  hot,  warm,  and  cold  zones,  anything  in  the  hot  or  warm  zone  is considered  potentially  contaminated  and  must  be  checked.  If  contamination  is  detected,  it  must  be decontaminated and rechecked for cleanliness prior to passing into the cold zone. E-16. A specific entrance and exit of the cold zone should be established. At the entrance to the warm and hot zones, a final check of personnel and equipment is done to ensure readiness prior to passing into these potentially  hazardous  zones.  At  the  established  exit  point  of  the  hot  and  warm  zone,  a  monitoring  and decontamination  point  is  set  up.  Personnel  and  equipment  are  monitored  for  contamination  and  are processed through the decontamination line. E-17. To track downrange personnel and equipment, a log must be maintained of personnel and equipment that are in the hot zone or warm zone or have been left in the hot or warm zone. A log is kept at the TOC concerning area operations/events, and a log is kept by the element that conducts sample collection in the hot zone. The log will include entry times and expected exit times. E-18. Before anyone enters the hot or warm zone, the decontamination station must be set up and manned. Also  a  back-up  entry  element  must  be  ready.  The  back-up  entry  element  will  serve  as  an  emergency extraction element and a relief element, should assessment be extensive and the operation take more time than expected. E-19. Once  mission  command/C2  is  established  and  the  steps  and  tasks  in  table  E-1  have  been accomplished to occupy the assembly area in the target area, the mission command/C2 element—   Obtains information relating to the area and weather conditions.  Prepares  downwind  hazard  plot  using  DOT,  Emergency  Response  Guidebook,  2008  or  other method.   Establishes staging areas upon approach (upwind and upgrade whenever possible) for arriving personnel.   Determines whether to request additional resources, based on information received.   Designates the tactical radio frequency to be used.   Establishes the CP location upwind/upgrade and at a safe distance from the area in a place away from direct involvement with casualties and personnel. Identifies the location of CP and staging areas for follow-on units. Initiates  the  accountability  system  for  those  involved.  May  need  to  assign  an  accountability officer.     Coordinates with security.   Ensures that security sweeps the area for secondary devices at the CP and staging areas.   Establishes minimum protective posture for personnel in the area. Formulates a plan, and disseminates it to the appropriate sectors.    Establishes and maintains direct communications with all elements such as, the decontamination element,  initial  entry  element,  sample  collection  element,  security  element,  and  others  as necessary.   Determines protective action distances if required.   Continues to emphasize awareness for the possibility of secondary devices and perpetrators.   Has common radio channels/frequencies assigned to sectors to improve operational control and efficiency.   Establishes casualty collection points.  Isolates the protective clothing worn by responders, and treats the clothing as contaminated until proven otherwise.   Establishes a contaminated waste area.   Makes arrangements for the replacement of contaminated protective clothing. 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 E-5 Appendix E  Schedules periodic situation briefings.

CONDUCT INITIAL AREA SURVEY E-20. It  is  critical  to  survey  the  overall  area  since  intelligence  analysis  and  information  reporting  only provides  an  idea  of  what  the  target  is  and  its  composition.  No  intelligence  is  100  percent  accurate  and conducting  an  overall  initial  area  survey  will  provide  the  R&S  element  an  understanding  of  the  current status of the target. E-21. An  initial  entry  element  is  sent  in  to  conduct  a  thorough  initial  area  survey  (actual  entry  element actions  for  follow-on  sample  collection  are  addressed  in  appendix  H).  The  following  are  key  tasks  (in priority order) accomplished during the initial area survey:   Determine oxygen levels.   Monitor for upper explosive limit (UEL) and lower explosive limit (LEL).   Determine volatile organic compound (VOC) levels.   Determine radiological levels.   Determine and revaluate the appropriate IPE/PPE.   Reevaluate protective posture for entry element.    Determine priority of effort.  Identify all structures in the area that are to be assessed. Prepare an area sketch to include determining the GPS coordinates and other location identifying information (for example, street addresses).   Designate buildings by numbers and rooms by letters (this is important later when assessing the material collected from the target). E-22. The initial entry element will consist of a minimum of two personnel. In the case where unexploded explosive ordnance (UXO) and IEDs exist, EOD personnel must be the initial entry element to render safe the devices. EOD personnel ensure that the area is clear of any additional IEDs, or booby traps. In the case of open areas (fields), a preliminary sweep will be conducted ensuring the same. When it is not practical to clear all IEDs, booby traps, or similar devices from the area, the EOD element will clear and mark a path to the sample collection area if sample collection is required. The initial entry element leader will determine the best placement for the path. Duties will have to be divided up among the element members to record the area,  monitor  the  site  for  hazards,  and  communicate.  If  possible  and  manpower  is  available,  additional personnel should be added to conduct the initial area survey. E-23. In unknown environments, the initial entry element will use the appropriate level of protection. If the use  of  Level  A  or  Level  B  using  supplied  air  is  required,  then  multiple  entries  into  the  site  may  be necessary to conduct the initial area survey. This is driven by the capacity (time) of the air supply available and if decontamination is required after each entry.  E-24. The initial area survey could be a relatively rapid task or a more prolonged task, depending on the size and complexity of the target area. This is primarily a “walk around” the area; maximum use of looking through windows will be utilized to observe inside structures. The recorder, with guidance from the initial entry element leader, will prepare the area sketch (figure E-1). Within the context of confined spaces, once E-6 ATP 3-11.37 /MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 25 March 2013 Dismounted Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Reconnaissance and Surveillance the area has been properly surveyed (oxygen levels, UEL and LEL, VOC levels, liquid/vapor hazards, and radiation levels have been determined), decisions can be made regarding the appropriate level of IPE/PPE for follow-on elements collecting samples or conducting presumptive or field confirmatory identification.  Figure E-1. Sample initial building sketch  E-25. As previously discussed,  the element  will  approach  the  area  from  upwind.  They will  use  separate entry and exit locations when entering and leaving the hot and cold zones. The reason behind not using the same route in as out, is that the follow-on element risks immediately becoming contaminated by taking the same route as a dirty element. Figure E-2 illustrates this concept.  Figure E-2. Sample building survey  E-26. Prior  to  entering  any  structure,  a  GPS  coordinate  of  the  structure  will  be  taken  and  entered  on  a diagram/sketch  form  (see  figure  E-3,  page  E-8)  for  an  example).  If  there  are  streets  running  near  the structure, the names of the streets, if known, will be entered and the proper address. The element moves in a clockwise (left to right) movement around the building to determine the size, number of entry points, and possible function of the building. E-27. To assist in the initial area survey, all buildings in the area will be assigned a numeric designator (for example, Building 1, Building 2). Within each building, all rooms will be identified by a letter designator (for example, Room A, Room B). Entrances to each building are noted on the area sketch, along with the number of floors and if the building extends below ground (see figure E-4, page E-8, and figure E-5, page E-10). This will provide a structure for tracking collected material (samples, documents, and other items of interest). It will also enhance mission command/C2. 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 E-7 Appendix E Legend: GPS N Global Positioning System North Figure E-3. Sample area sketch  Figure E-4. Sample room identification and sequence E-28. The entry element will mark the door with a slash. This indicates that an element has entered through that doorway. When they exit, they will mark the same door, leaving an X. This indicates that an element has entered and exited. They will also place the room designation on the door; A for the first room. (See table E-2 for marking scheme.)    E-8 ATP 3-11.37 /MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 25 March 2013 Dismounted Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Reconnaissance and Surveillance Table E-2. Door and entrance marking Location When marking doors, place the markings on the door if possible. This avoids confusion if doors are close to each other.  The second location is on either side of the door. If there is a potential for confusion as to which door is being marked, an arrow in the information section of the marking can be used. The third location is on the floor immediately in front of the door in question. Route markings that indicate direction are placed on the walls at eye level to indicate the direction an element has moved. Colored chalk, tape, or permanent marker can be used to mark. When possible, markings are made at eye level.  Markings will be large and clearly legible. Element has entered a room/passed through a doorway, and has not exited. A single slash is placed on the door. The element has entered/passed through and has exited. This marking is a continuation of the original slash placed on a door where entry was made. The element has cleared the room and needs to be reviewed by follow-on elements. This could mean that there are potential samples or other items of interest to follow-on elements. Information provided at the base of the marking is reserved for things of immediate importance to an element making an entry, that is; UXO, booby traps, flammable atmosphere readings, other possible dangers, or other information important to follow-on elements. Element has moved in the direction indicated. The design of the arrow is of little importance, as long as it clearly shows the direction of movement by the element.       unexploded ordnance Legend: UXO E-29. The  initial  entry  element  will  conduct  first-entry  monitoring  of  the  area  for  the  presence  of  a hazardous environment. First-entry monitoring can also assist to determine sample priorities. For confined space, or limited ventilation areas, the initial-entry element will check air quality for explosive hazard, or lack of oxygen by using an appropriate detector. Prior to opening the door, the entry element will use the detector with the sampling probe if so equipped. The probe will be slipped under the doorframe if possible. If not, the element will carefully crack the door open, observe for booby traps, and insert the probe into the room.  The  element  will  use the  detector  to  determine the  room’s  oxygen  level,  if  there  are  combustible gases present (LEL),  and  if VOCs  are  present  in  the  atmosphere.  The  element  will  also  check  radiation levels.  The  lack  of  oxygen  (not  applicable  if  the  element  is  using  their  SCBA  systems),  presence  of combustible gases, a high concentration of VOCs, or radiation above a predesignated level would cause the element to abort their entry. In the case of VOCs, the element would have to determine what compounds are present before making a determination if it safe to enter and if a change in IPE/PPE is necessary. E-30. If  the  detector  readings  are  acceptable,  the  element  will  proceed.  Continuing  to  check  for  booby traps, the element will fully open the door. The door should be jammed open. The element will carefully enter the structure. Once inside, the element will gain situational awareness. The element must survey and assess the structure. If possible, the element should start at the lowest level. Whatever level they begin on is designated as floor one. E-31. The initial entry element will move through the structure in a clockwise (left to right) movement. While in the structure, the element will make radio checks with the command every five minutes. During this  radio  check,  the  element  will  apprise  the  CP  of  their  location  and  actions.  If  the  element  loses communication with the CP, they will retrace their movement until communications can be reestablished. If 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 E-9 Appendix E communications cannot be reestablished, the element will execute their contingency for communications loss such as sending the back-up entry element to reestablish communication. Note. In no instance should a single person be sent into the hot zone. E-32. The initial entry element will survey the room using a search pattern. The room should be divided into quadrants. The element should search the room starting at the door and work from left to right. The initial sweep of the room is to observe for key items of interest and hazards. The element will designate the room walls with numbers so to better record what they see (see figures E-5 and E-6). The element will be alert to the presence of radiation (using a RADIAC detector) and CW agents (using chemical detectors such as the lightweight chemical detector/joint chemical agent detector). The element members will continually check the device for readings.  Figure E-5. Numeric designation of room walls   Figure E-6. Initial room sweep  E-33. The initial entry element should be alert for the presence of booby traps. The element should touch nothing  during  the  initial  sweep.  They  should  note  the  location  of  closed  containers  and  items  of  key interest. The initial sweep is to obtain information to facilitate detection and identification operations. The second element member should use a digital video camera to record the room. E-34. The initial entry element will mark safety hazards, access and egress areas, and any challenges that may  affect  the  operational  effort  of  the  sample  collection  element.  Marking  may  be  used  using  red chemlights  to  mark  (identify)  potential  forms  of  harm:  thermal,  radiological,  asphyxiation,  chemical, biological, mechanical, and structural. Green may be used to mark access/egress routes, and clear paths of travel. Each CBRN R&S element should have internal  marking procedures in its SOP. Chemlights  may also be used to mark rooms to be exploited by follow-on elements. E-10 ATP 3-11.37 /MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 25 March 2013 Dismounted Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Reconnaissance and Surveillance Note. Area survey rule of thumb: turn nothing off that is on and nothing on that is off. E-35. During  the  initial  sweep  of  the  room,  the  initial  entry  element  should  locate  items  of  interest (warning  signs,  added  or  extra  ventilation,  markings  on  containers,  chemical  symbols  or  notation, paperwork,  drawings,  sketches).  The  element  should  look  for  items  relating  to  CBRN,  such  as  the following: Processing equipment.   Containment.    Waste disposal. Signs of release.  Safety equipment.  E-36. The equipment can be varied and may never have been intended for the purposes it is now being used. Additionally, the safety considerations for handling and storing material may be very different than that of a western nation. E-37. Initial survey observations are—   Look for anything obvious while securing and during initial survey of area.   Determine if CBRN agents are being produced, stored, or weaponized at this location.   Be alert for booby traps/IEDs.   Note instrument readings and/or detections.   Consider if layout of area is consistent with facility (false walls/rooms). D-86. When a suspicious item is encountered, the entry element must first assess the “big picture,” look for all hazards before proceeding, document its location and the surrounding area, and finally, determine if it is an item of interest. Is this item CBRN-related and was it expected or not? If it is not CBRN-related, is it hazardous and does it pose a threat? E-38. When approaching the item of interest— Photograph/document the undisturbed item.    Determine if the item recognizable?   Move toward the item.   Watch for dangers.   Record all actions with the item.  Initiate detection procedures. E-39. Once the initial sweep of the room has been completed, the entry element should proceed to the next room. Once the entire building has been surveyed, the entry element should move to the element control point. Depending on the size and complexity of the target, the initial surveys may take a short period of time or could require a substantial amount of time. Depending on the IPE/PPE and detection equipment (based on hazard) requirements, there may be multiple trips required to complete the initial survey. E-40. If possible, the R&S element should sketch out the structure as they move through it. This may be difficult  given  a  complex  structure,  but  it  will  allow  the  element  to  better  document  their  findings  and develop the sample collection plan. It also provides better clarity to those reading the assessment report. E-41. The initial entry element leader will mark possible sample collection points by priority (the preferred method is to use 3- by 5- inch cards with the number one as the top priority), but the priorities are subject to change based on METT-TC/METT-T. E-42. Using the diagram/sketch form, the sample element leader will start to sketch the layout of the area where  sample  collection  is  to  take  place.  This  is  done  in  each  room/area  where  sample  collection  is projected to occur. Particular attention will be paid to determining potential sample collection locations. Sketch the layout of the room/field with dimensions, measurements, and items that may be of interest. The diagram/sketch  form  may  be  used  to  brief  the  sample  collection  element  and  will  be  used  for  further analysis of the sample collection area. The sample collection element may use this form when conducting 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 E-11 Appendix E sample management operations. Relevant reference points, hazards, and control areas should be annotated on the form. Numbered index cards that are indicated in the diagram/sketch form can be linked with the photographic log. In this way, sample collection locations have a commonality throughout the operation. E-43. On completion of photographing, filming, and surveying, the R&S element will place documentation into a large zip top bag with information facing outward so it may be read. Photographic equipment will be bagged, unless equipment was placed in an underwater camera case before entering the contaminated area, and  processed  through  technical  decontamination.  Care  must  be  exercised  in  the  handling  of  possibly contaminated  equipment  with  sensitive  electronics.  Denatured  alcohol  may  be  used  to  wipe  down equipment. If contamination is suspected on the device, use liquid crystal displays on video camera and digital camera to review area information without removing the photographic equipment from their clear overpacks, a 6-milliliter bag or zip top bags. E-44. Based  upon  the  area  assessment,  the  element  leader  will  revise  his  plan  for  assessment  and collection. A priority of effort for sample collection will be developed. E-45. Based on METT-TC/METT-T the R&S element leader may execute one of the following COAs:   Call forward the sample collection element and begin sample management operations. Ensure that sample element brings all required equipment to the sample area. Sample collection element leader will brief his personnel on sample collection operations concept. This occurs when limited time is available and adequate protection is available for the R&S element to stay longer. This method  allows  for  the  leader  to  actually  be  present  and  show  further  sample  collection  and exploitation elements where to collect samples. A drawback is the guidance and briefing to the arriving element will be done while in protective posture and giving an effective briefing in this type of situation may not be conducive to good communications. This includes additional entry elements continuing the area assessment and rest periods per entry element. Sample collection element leader will process through technical decontamination with the EOD element and recorder. After processing through technical decontamination, the sample collection element  leader  will  formulate  the  sample  management  plan  based  on  any  intelligence, photographs, and area sketches obtained of the sample area. This method is used when there is enough  time  and  equipment  (for  example,  IPE/PPE,  dosimetry  devices,  and  decontaminants) available.  E-46. After processing through technical decontamination, the reconnaissance leader will brief the sample collection  element  members.  They  will  review  any  digital  photographs,  video,  and  the  diagram/sketch form. As part of this area overview, the reconnaissance leader will identify all hazards noted. At this time, the  initial  entry  element  leader  will  review  possible  sample  collection  points  with  sample  collection element leaders so that the sample collection points are valid. The R&S element leader will make IPE/PPE adjustments based on detection and identification of agents as required. SAMPLE MANAGEMENT PLAN E-47. The development of a sample management plan is discussed in appendix H. SAMPLE COLLECTION E-48. Sample collection TTP are discussed in appendix H. EXIT PROCEDURES/DECONTAMINATION E-49. Prior to exiting the area, the R&S element must communicate ahead to the decontamination station in the warm zone so that the decontamination personnel are prepared to receive them.  E-50. The method of decontamination is determined based on time available, threat level, and the IPE/PPE worn. As a minimum, decontamination of boots/footgear is necessary for all personnel and equipment that have been in the hot zone. It is possible that no contamination was encountered in the hot zone and the R&S element leader can forego conducting decontamination based on the findings of the entry elements and field analysis conducted. Prior to decontamination, a check is conducted of all personnel that were in the hot zone.  E-12 ATP 3-11.37 /MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 25 March 2013 Dismounted Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Reconnaissance and Surveillance E-51. The R&S element is self-sufficient in using technical decontamination. Technical decontamination allows the R&S element to rapidly process through a decontamination station, removing their contaminated IPE/PPE  and  monitoring  devices.  All  contaminated  IPE/PPE,  monitoring  devices,  and  individual  and collective  equipment  is  packaged  for  processing  off-target  at  a  supported  decontamination  site.  See MultiService  Tactics,  Techniques,  and  Procedures  for  Chemical,  Biological,  Radiological,  and  Nuclear Consequence Management Operations for more information on emergency and technical decontamination procedures. E-52. If the situation is permissive and the R&S element is supported by a decontamination unit, then a thorough decontamination operation should be undertaken at or near the target. This will limit the possible spread of contamination and negate the need for further decontamination operations. E-53. If Level A or Level B PPE is worn, then it is necessary to perform technical decontamination. It is similar to a conventional thorough decontamination line, but incorporates the use of water and the doffing procedures  necessary  when  wearing  SCBA.  See  MultiService  Tactics,  Techniques,  and  Procedures  for Chemical,  Biological,  Radiological,  and  Nuclear  Consequence  Management  Operations  for  more information on technical decontamination. PACKAGING/DOCUMENTATION/TRANSPORT E-54. Sample packaging, documentation, and transport are discussed in appendix H. REPORTING E-55. Reporting should normally occur as a two-part process:   Initial assessment report. The first report of the initial findings will occur upon completion of the mission or upon identification of PIR. Reporting of an identified PIR will occur immediately when found. Suspect  area  survey  report.  The  final  postmission  report  will  be  delivered  to  the  higher headquarters,  normally  within  48  hours  unless  otherwise  specified  in  the  order,  SOPs,  or command guidance. Report format can be found in appendix H.  DISMOUNTED CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR RECONNAISSANCE OPERATIONS E-56. The CBRN reconnaissance survey techniques that are used for dismounted reconnaissance operations are similar to those used for mounted operations, except for the distances covered and the duration of time spent  in  an  area.  Dismounted  reconnaissance  is  configured  in  a  minimum  of  two-man  elements  for personnel safety. One person conducts the dismounted reconnaissance, while the other person remains in overwatch as security.   E-57. Dismounted  CBRN  reconnaissance  provides  the  tactical  commander  with  accurate  information pertaining  to  CBRN  activity  in  the  operational  environment  in  order  to  prepare  forces  to  operate  in  the CBRN  environment  or,  if  possible,  avoid  contamination.  The  key  tasks  for  CBRN  reconnaissance  are detect,  locate,  identify,  quantify,  sample  collection,  survey,  mark,  and  report.  (Detailed  information  on sample collection can be found in appendix H, marking in appendix J, and reporting in appendix I.) The commander  considers  the  factors  of  METT-TC/METT-T  to  determine  whether  to  conduct  dismounted reconnaissance.  E-58. If a CBRN R&S element is using a Level A or B protective ensemble, a backup R&S element should be on standby. MultiService Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical (NBC) Protection provides information on levels of IPE and PPE. The backup R&S element can assist the primary R&S element if a problem occurs. The backup R&S element, as a minimum, will enter the area of suspected contamination in the same level of protection as the primary element.  E-59. Dismounted CBRN reconnaissance operations may be conducted upwind, downwind, or crosswind of the suspected area of contamination. The survey element remains mounted until reaching a point 100 meters from the limit of the possible hazard (provided by the CBRN control center [CBRNCC]). At that 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 E-13 Appendix E point, members of the survey element dismount, don the appropriate level of IPE/PPE, dosimetry devices, and  initiate  the  predetermined  dismounted  technique  (for  example  the  zigzag,  lane,  cloverleaf,  or  grid). Details for these techniques are shown later in this appendix. The mission is terminated after detecting or locating  the hazard  as planned or  upon  reaching  the  expected  source of  the  hazard  and  getting negative detection results. E-60. Using  an  upwind  approach,  the  members  of  the  survey  element  will  reach  the  expected  point  of release (source) of the hazard quicker and are not exposed to the hazard until they are close to the release point. They do run the risk of being exposed to greater levels of contamination because the concentration of the  CBRN  agent  or  materials  will  be  greater  at  the  release  point.  This  is  especially  true  for  radioactive sources. E-61. Dismounted  CBRN  reconnaissance  operations  are  similar  to  mounted  operations  described  in appendix C. However, dismounted operations require more time, CBRN reconnaissance personnel are more exposed  to  the  effects  of  CBRN  hazards,  and  activities  are  conducted  on  foot  in  lieu  of  vehicles.  The following are CBRN survey procedures:   Locate the general boundaries of the contaminated area.  Place  warning  markers  at  specified  intervals  around  the  contaminated  area  and  at  all  entry points.   Determine the intensity of the contamination.   Report information using CBRN4 report. E-62. Commanders may use one of three forms of reconnaissance, or a combination of the three. The three forms of CBRN reconnaissance are route reconnaissance, zone reconnaissance, and area reconnaissance. ROUTE RECONNAISSANCE E-63. Route  reconnaissance  is  a  form  of  reconnaissance  that  focuses  along  a  specific  line  of communications,  such  as  a road,  railway, or  cross-country  mobility  corridor.  The procedures  for CBRN route reconnaissance procedures are—   Determine the appropriate level of protection.   Reconnoiter the route and determine locations of contaminated areas along the route.   Conduct CBRN survey to define the boundaries of the contamination.   Locate and mark bypass routes if contamination is encountered.    Evaluate and classify bridges, defiles, overpasses and underpasses, and culverts along the route so that CBRN weapons have not produced collateral damage.   Locate  fords,  crossing  sites,  or  bypasses  for  existing  and  reinforcing  obstacles  (including built-up areas) along the route to avoid or bypass CBRN hazard. Identify and mark clear bypass routes.    Report and mark CBRN hazards along the route. AREA RECONNAISSANCE E-64. A CBRN area reconnaissance is a directed effort to obtain detailed information concerning a specific area. An area reconnaissance is a specialized form of zone reconnaissance that proceeds faster since the effort is focused on a specific piece of terrain. CBRN area reconnaissance procedures are—   Determine the appropriate level of protection.   Reconnoiter all terrain within the area for contamination.   Locate bypass routes around identified contaminated areas.   Report and mark all chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear hazards within the area.   Locate and mark bypass routes if contamination is encountered.   Request decontamination support if necessary. E-14 ATP 3-11.37 /MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 25 March 2013 Dismounted Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Reconnaissance and Surveillance ZONE RECONNAISSANCE E-65. Zone  reconnaissance  is  a  form  of  reconnaissance  that  involves  a  directed  effort  to  obtain  detailed information on all routes, obstacles, terrain, and adversary forces within a zone defined by boundaries. A zone  reconnaissance  is  a  deliberate,  time-consuming  process  that  requires  a  substantial  expenditure  of resources and is optimum for dismounted reconnaissance. Zone reconnaissance procedures are—   Determine the appropriate level of protection.   Locate  previously  reported  chemical,  biological,  radiological,  and  nuclear  incident  areas  and determine if there is still a hazard.   Reconnoiter all terrain within the zone for contamination. Locate possible contamination within the zone.   Report and mark chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear hazards within the zone.    Locate commercial chemical or nuclear facilities, storage areas, and waste sites.   Check water sources for contamination.   Mark contaminated areas.   Request decontamination support.   Locate routes to bypass contamination. SUPPORT AREA E-66. The areas of greatest vulnerability are large fixed sites (for example, ports of debarkation), staging and  marshaling  areas,  hubs,  bases,  assembly  areas,  MSRs,  and  sites  involved  in  early  force  buildup activities.   Aerial  port  of  debarkation  fixed  sites  may  also  be  targeted  to  disrupt  or  inhibit  U.S.  military deployments. Because it is unlikely that the operational areas of an aerial port of debarkation will be contaminated at any one time, it is particularly important that the commander know the location of hazard areas, working and parking area requirements, and the availability of runways and taxiways.  SPODs  may  also  be  attractive  targets  for  CBRN  attack.  CBRN  attacks  may  result  in contamination of some operating surfaces, but the size of the contaminated area may be small compared to the size of the port. Conducting area reconnaissance at facilities within the port is important to sustaining throughput operations.  DISMOUNTED CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR LOCATE TECHNIQUES E-67. To  find  suspected  or  actual  CBRN  hazards,  CBRN  locate  techniques  are  used.  The  staff  passes intelligence information gathered from the suspected or actual incident to the CBRN R&S element. When conducting  dismounted  CBRN  reconnaissance  tasks,  the  CBRN  R&S  element  assumes  the  appropriate protective  posture  according  to  intelligence  information.  CBRN  dismounted,  locate  techniques  require more  time  and  possible  exposure  to  contamination  than  mounted  operations.  CBRN  locate  techniques require applied judgment based on METT-TC/METT-T. The mission, terrain, and adversary indicate the technique that should be used. Additional considerations for dismounted, CBRN locate techniques include unexpected encounters such as adversary situation, type of agent, and need for decontamination operations. Upon completion of CBRN locate techniques, the CBRN R&S element reports findings and awaits follow-on orders such as conducting survey operations. E-68. There  are  four  techniques  used  to  locate  possible  contamination  in  the  AOR.  The  techniques  are zigzag, lane, cloverleaf, and grid. ZIGZAG E-69. The zigzag technique is used to locate contaminated areas during route, zone, or area reconnaissance missions. Depending on the terrain, the distances could be larger or smaller. The zigzag technique has a 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 E-15 Appendix E higher  probability  of  detecting  contamination  because  the  surface  area  not  traversed  is  less  than  that  of other search techniques. The following are procedures for the dismounted, zigzag technique (figure E-7) :   The CBRN R&S element begins its search at the deployment (start) line, maintaining at least 25-meter intervals between personnel.   The CBRN R&S element moves forward along a line that is oriented 45° from the start line.   The CBRN R&S element monitors identification equipment for indications of contamination.   After the CBRN R&S element has moved 100 meters along the first zig, it turns 90° and zags taking readings at each turn and repeating the process until the end.   Depending on the terrain, the distances could be larger or smaller.   The CBRN R&S element continues to zigzag until the CBRN R&S element has reached its limit of advance.    Once the entire mission area has been searched, the CBRN R&S element reports the results.    The  CBRN  R&S  element  repeats  the  process  until  contamination  is  detected  or  the  entire If the CBRN R&S element did not search the entire mission area, it begins a new sweep. mission area is searched.   The CBRN R&S element reports the results normally using CBRN4 report.   The CBRN R&S element coordinates for decontamination.   The CBRN R&S element may transition to a CBRN survey if contamination is found. LANE E-70. The lane technique is used to locate contaminated areas. It is very similar to the zigzag technique, but is primarily used during route reconnaissance missions. It can also be used for area reconnaissance of long, narrow pieces of terrain (such as defiles). The procedures for the lane technique are—   The CBRN R&S element begins its search at the line of departure with an interval of less than 50 meters between personnel.   The CBRN R&S element would follow an azimuth for a designated distance.  For narrow routes, the CBRN R&S element moves in a staggered column. Each CBRN R&S element moves along a line until it reaches the limit of advance. If the CBRN R&S element did not search the entire mission area, it begins a new sweep and repeats the process until contamination is detected or the entire mission area is searched. If contamination is found on a route, the CBRN R&S element creates/submits a CBRN4 report and moves on to the next lane.     Once the entire mission area has been searched, the CBRN R&S element reports the results.   The CBRN R&S element coordinates for decontamination.   The CBRN R&S element may transition to a CBRN survey if contamination is found.

The dismounted, cloverleaf technique (figures E-16 and 17) is time-consuming; however, it provides detailed coverage and information about an area. The following are procedures for the dismounted, clover technique:   The  CBRN  R&S  element  begins  its  cloverleaf  at  a  starting  point  central  to  the  area  to  be checked.   The CBRN R&S element moves in a figure-8 pattern using the start point as the center of the 8. If a second element is used, the second element conducts the same pattern moving 90º direction from the first element. If only one element is conducting the cloverleaf, it completes one figure 8 and then conducts a second figure 8 at a 90º angle from the first figure 8.   The CBRN R&S element monitors identification equipment for indications of contamination.   The CBRN R&S element will conduct check at set intervals along its route, or for radiological can conduct continuous monitoring.  Note. Depending on the terrain, the distances could be larger or smaller.  If  the  CBRN  R&S  element  did  not  search  the  entire  mission  area,  it  begins  a  new  cloverleaf within the area not checked.   The  CBRN  R&S  element  repeats  the  process  until  contamination  is  detected  or  the  entire mission area is searched.    The CBRN R&S element reports the results normally using a CBRN4 report.   The CBRN R&S element coordinates for decontamination   The CBRN R&S element may transition to a CBRN survey if contamination is found. Figure E-9. Dismounted, cloverleaf technique  GRID E-72. The  grid  technique  is  employed  by  R&S  elements  conducting  dismounted  reconnaissance,  where accuracy is important. It is employed by superimposing a grid over the R&S element maps, which enables them to rapidly communicate locations for detections, where samples were collected, and the locations of casualties. Number and/or letters are assigned to each detection point and each detection point is associated with a predetermined GPS location. (See figure E-19.) E-73. The following are procedures for the grid technique:   The CBRN R&S element establishes the boundaries of the area to be checked. E-18 ATP 3-11.37 /MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 25 March 2013 Dismounted Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Reconnaissance and Surveillance   The CBRN R&S element preselects points within the area that it will check for contamination.   Normally the points to be checked are laid out in an evenly spaced grid pattern.   The CBRN R&S element conducts checks at each point within the grid.   The CBRN R&S element reports the results normally using a CBRN4 report.   The CBRN R&S element coordinates for decontamination.   The CBRN R&S element may transition to a CBRN survey if contamination is found. Figure E-10. Dismounted, grid technique  TRIANGULATION E-74. The triangulation search technique is used to locate radiological sources that have been detected by some form of dosimeter or detector. The triangulation technique’s strengths in locating radioactive sources lie  with  the  small  number  of  personnel  (three)  needed  to  accomplish  the  procedure,  thereby  ensuring personnel  exposures  remain  as  low  as  reasonably  achievable,  and  the  ability  to  rapidly  locate  the radioactive source even if there are buildings or other shielding materials in the area. E-75. Shielding effects from buildings may produce confusing dose rate readings. Use the procedures in below when obstacles are encountered along the triangulation legs:   The  element  leader  takes  readings  in  a  semicircular  sweep  method,  at  the  location  of  initial hazard recognition, noting the directional heading of maximum exposure.  From this heading, the two additional personnel are sent out 100 meters in directions of +45° and -45° from the initial heading. Personnel perform the sweep method to determine the direction heading of maximum exposure.  If readings are less than 0.02 centigray per hour, personnel reverse their heading and travel back 60 meters, and perform the sweep method again.       Once  three  readings  above  0.02  centigray  per  hour  are  obtained  and  plotted,  an  indication  of what area contains the radiological source should be evident. 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 E-19 Appendix E E-76. The following are procedures for triangulation with obstacles:   Walk along the obstacle staying 10 meters away at all times, taking readings while facing the obstacle every 5 to 10 meters.     Upon  reaching  the  end  of  the  obstacle,  travel  beyond  the  obstacle  20  meters,  assume  the direction  of  the  original  heading,  and  take  the  next  set  of  dose  rate  readings  by  using  the semicircular sweep method.  If the largest dose rate reading does not point back toward the obstacle, provide the directional heading towards the largest reading. However, if the largest dose rate reading does point back toward the direction of the obstacle, provide the directional heading associated with the largest reading taken from behind the obstacle.  In some situations, element members may reach the end of the obstacle and see that all dose rate readings were the same. Under these circumstances, personnel should continue to take readings at 10-meter intervals along the entire obstacle perimeter. If exposure readings in the direction of the  obstacle  remain  constant,  the  source  is  located  in  the  obstacle. However,  if  the  dose  rate readings do not remain constant, provide the directional heading, facing away from the obstacle, at the location of the largest dose rate reading.  E-77. The projected area of where the radiological source is located is then used as the focal point for a cordon declaration by the incident commander.  Note.  If  at  any  time  the  dose  rate  is  above  1  centigray  per  hour  stop  immediately,  note  the location and direction of the reading, and leave the area. Adjustments to the triangulation legs must be made so that personnel exposure remains as low as reasonably achievable. Figure E-11. Triangulation locate technique  E-78. Time challenges may exist when dealing with large sample areas that require the collection of many samples.  DISMOUNTED CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR SURVEY TECHNIQUES  E-79. CBRN  surveys  define  the  boundaries  of  contaminated  areas.  CBRN  survey  techniques  require applied judgment based on METT-TC/METT-T. The mission, the terrain, and the adversary indicate the technique that should be used. There are four dismounted survey techniques that can be employed when the contamination is located: nearside-farside, box, star, and bounce-and-bypass.  E-20 ATP 3-11.37 /MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 25 March 2013 Dismounted Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Reconnaissance and Surveillance NEARSIDE-FARSIDE E-80. The  nearside-farside  dismounted  survey  technique  (figures  E-23  and  E-24)  is  used  by  an  R&S element whenever they enter a contaminated area. The nearside-farside survey technique employed by a dismounted  element  is  similar  to  the  technique  used  by  the  mounted  element,  except  for  the  intervals between detection points. The dismounted survey element uses 50- to 100-meter intervals. The following are procedures for the dismounted nearside-farside survey technique:   Each CBRN R&S element determines if they are in the contaminated area.  If  a  CBRN  R&S  element  is  in  the  contaminated  area,  it  moves  back  along  its  original  path checking for contamination every 50 meters until CBRN contamination is no longer detected.   Once out of the contaminated area, it emplaces appropriate warning markers.   Once the initial element has found the nearside boundary of contamination, it moves forward across the contaminated area, testing every 100 meters.   When contamination is no longer detected, the R&S element moves forward another 100 meters and checks again. If no contamination is detected, it places a CBRN warning marker.    This process is repeated until it is clear of the contamination.   Each R&S element executes this process to determine the nearside and farside boundaries of the contamination.   The CBRN R&S element reports the results normally using CBRN4 report.   The CBRN R&S element coordinates for decontamination. Figure E-12. Dismounted, nearside-farside survey technique  25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 E-21 Appendix E BOUNCE-AND-BYPASS E-81. The bounce-and-bypass dismounted survey technique (figures E-25 and E-26) is used to locate the general  boundaries  of  a  CBRN  contaminated  area.  The  following  are  procedures  for  the  dismounted, bounce-and-pass survey technique:   The CBRN R&S element stops and checks for contamination in their immediate areas.  If no contamination is detected, the CBRN R&S element proceeds forward until contamination is detected.   Once contamination is detected, the CBRN R&S element proceeds out of the contaminated area and places a CBRN marker where no contamination is found.   The  CBRN  R&S  element  proceeds  along  a  general  axis  moving  in  the  appropriate  cardinal direction away from the initial start point at least 100 meters or as prescribed in the operation order.   Then  turn  in  the  same  cardinal  direction  toward  the  contaminated  area  until  contamination  is detected again.    Once contamination is detected, the CBRN R&S element proceeds out of the contaminated area and places a CBRN marker where no contamination is found.   This process will continue until no contamination is found.    The CBRN R&S element reports the results normally using CBRN4 report.   The CBRN R&S element coordinates for decontamination. Figure E-13. Dismounted, bounce-and-bypass technique  COURSE LEG E-82. The course leg technique is used to find the extent and intensity of radiological contamination. The CBRN R&S element moves between two checkpoints; for example, from Point A (top of a hill) to Point B (top of another hill). Readings are taken at given intervals along the route between the two checkpoints. When conducting a dismounted, radiological course leg, the element must be given a turn-back dose and turn-back dose rate. Reporting results of dismounted, course leg techniques may be done in various ways. Normally a survey data sheet can be filled out and turned in to the tasking headquarters at the end of the mission or the data can be sent via a CBRN4 report. The following procedures outline and the course leg technique:   The CBRN R&S element reads the survey meter and records the dose rate at the start point of the course leg. E-22 ATP 3-11.37 /MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 25 March 2013 Dismounted Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Reconnaissance and Surveillance   The CBRN R&S element reads the survey meter and records the dose rate at each preselected interval along the course leg. Under no circumstances should the element continue further into a contaminated area if it reaches its turn-back dose or turn-back dose rate.   The CBRN R&S element reads the survey meter and records the dose rate at the end point of the course leg.   The CBRN R&S element reports the results normally using CBRN4 report.   The CBRN R&S element coordinates for decontamination.   The  CBRN  R&S  element  rechecks  and  zeros  the  RADIAC  meter  before  each  course  leg  to assure proper operation. Note.  Conducting  dismounted,  radiological  course  legs  versus  mounted  or  aerial  radiological course  legs  results  in  higher  radiation  doses  to  personnel.  Further  guidance  on  radiological aspect of conducting a course leg technique can be found in MultiService Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Contamination Avoidance. PRESELECTED DOSE RATE E-83. The dismounted R&S element looks for a given dose rate or multiple given dose rates designated by the  commander.  This  technique  is  used  for  old  contamination  and  neutron-induced  radiation.  For  old contamination that is greater than the time of attack (for example, (H)+48), the CBRN R&S element moves along a route or designated straight line in an area until it finds 1 centigray per hour and/or its designated dose rates. When conducting a dismounted, radiological preselected dose rate technique, the element must be given OEG, which includes a turn-back dose and turn-back dose rate. Reporting results of dismounted, preselected dose rate techniques may be done in various ways. Normally, a survey data sheet can be filled out and turned in to the tasking headquarters at the end of the mission, or the data can be sent via a CBRN4 report. The following procedures outline and illustrate the preselected dose rate technique (see figure E-30): E-84. The  CBRN  R&S  element  departs  its  start  point  and  constantly  monitors  the  survey  meter  while moving  along  its  designated  route.  Under  no  circumstances  should  the  element  continue  further  into  a contaminated area if it reaches its turn-back dose or turn-back dose rate.   Upon locating a reading of 1 centigray and/or its designated dose rates, the CBRN R&S element records the dose rate and drops a radiological marker if directed.    The CBRN R&S element records its final reading upon reaching the end point of its route or its highest preselected dose rate.    The CBRN R&S element reports the results normally using CBRN4 report.   The  CBRN  R&S  element  reports  personnel  exposure  to  its  command  for  recording  and annotation in their medical records.   The CBRN R&S element coordinates for decontamination.   The CBRN R&S element rechecks and zeros the RADIAC meter before each mission to assure proper operation. Note.  Conducting  dismounted,  radiological  preselected  dose  rate  missions  versus  mounted  or aerial radiological preselected dose rate missions, results in higher radiation doses to personnel. Further guidance on radiological aspects of conducting a preselected dose rate technique can be found  in  MultiService  Tactics,  Techniques,  and  Procedures  for  Chemical,  Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Contamination Avoidance. 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 E-23 Appendix E Figure E-14.

The  box  dismounted,  survey  technique  is  used  to  determine  the  general  dimensions  (length  and width)  of  a  contaminated  area.  Figure  E-31  and  figure  E-32,  page  E-30,  outline  and  illustrate  the dismounted, box survey technique. The CBRN R&S element may use the decision tree depicted in figure E-33, page E-30, to determine which direction and distance to proceed. The following are dismounted, box survey techniques:   The CBRN R&S elements stop and check for contamination in their immediate areas.   The first CBRN R&S element to report contamination becomes the base element.  If any other CBRN R&S element is located in the contaminated area, they must back out of the contamination.   All other CBRN R&S elements should orient on the base element.   At least one CBRN R&S element should be to the left and one CBRN R&S element to the right of the base element.   When  contamination  is  found,  a  CBRN4  report  is  generated  and  the  element  turns  180°  and returns to a grid intersection.    A CBRN marker is placed if the grid intersection is far enough away from the contamination. (If not, the element moves out further to place a CBRN marker.)    The left CBRN R&S element turns 90° to the right and bounds to the next grid intersection to determine the extent of the contamination. (Conversely, the right element turns 90° to the left and bounds to the next grid intersection to determine the extent of the contamination.)   This process is continued until the presence of or extent of contamination is confirmed and until the CBRN R&S elements meet.   This process of going straight or turning continues in a boxlike movement until the element has crossed the initial farside line; this is the initial right limit of the contamination.   The movement of the CBRN R&S element depends on the orientation of the contaminated area.   Once the CBRN R&S element has reached the initial farside line, the element moves toward the base element while checking for contamination.   The  element  to  the  left of  the base  CBRN  R&S  element  executes  the  same  movement  as  the CBRN  R&S  element  to  the  right,  except  its  first  turn  is  to  the  left.  While  this  may  sound complicated, it is not difficult to execute.   The reconnaissance CBRN R&S element leader must receive continuous reports from the other elements on their findings—positive or negative. From these reports, the CBRN R&S element leader plots the findings to get a general idea of the contamination layout.    Once the CBRN R&S element leader is satisfied that the limits of the contamination have been determined, the R&S element locates the best route to bypass the contamination.    Warning  markers  are  erected  around  the  contamination  and  along  any  trails  leading  into  the contaminated area so that the bypass route is clearly marked.   The CBRN R&S element reports the results normally using CBRN4 report.   The CBRN R&S element coordinates for decontamination. 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 E-25 Appendix E Figure E-16.

The  dismounted,  star  survey  technique  is  a  very  quick  way  to  determine  the  rough  limits  of  a contaminated area. The following are dismounted, star survey technique procedures:   The CBRN R&S element that encounters the contamination moves back from the contaminated area 100 meters from the initial positive reading.   This point is the base of the star.

Figure E-18. Dismounted, star survey technique  DISMOUNTED CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR RECONNAISSANCE MOVEMENT TECHNIQUES E-87.  A CBRN R&S element uses standard movement formations and techniques to arrive at its assigned area. These techniques are similar to those described in appendix C for mounted operations except that they are conducted dismounted.  E-88. The  CBRN  R&S  element  employs  movement  techniques  for  a  number  of  reasons:  to  minimize exposure,  maintain  freedom  of  movement,  maximize  available  tactical  options,  and  react  effectively  to contact.  Effectively  employed,  dismounted  movement  techniques  allow  the  R&S  element  to  find  and observe threats/hazards without being compromised. E-89. At  the  same  time,  however,  dismounted  movement  techniques  alone  are  not  enough  to  guarantee accomplishment of these tactical goals. The CBRN R&S element must use them in conjunction with other movement- and security-related measures. For example, the CBRN R&S element must make maximum use of all available natural cover and concealment when moving.  E-90. The CBRN R&S element conducting dismounted operations may use vehicles to reach a point near or on the target. When vehicles are involved, the CBRN R&S element must consider the security of the vehicles. That includes the use of additional personnel and the possibility of compromise of the operation 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 E-27 Appendix E from vehicle noise. There are two security formations used when vehicles are not moving—herringbone and coil. HERRINGBONE E-91. The  herringbone  formation  (figure  E-19)  is  used  to  disperse  the  CBRN  R&S  element  when  it  is traveling in a column formation. The herringbone formation may be used during air attacks, or when the element must stop during movement, or personnel must dismount to conduct one or more of the CBRN reconnaissance tasks. The herringbone formation allows the CBRN R&S element to move to covered and concealed  positions  from  a  road  or  an  open  area,  and  it  establishes  all-round  security  without  requiring detailed  instructions.  Vehicles  are  repositioned  as  necessary  to  take  advantage  of  the  best  cover, concealment,  and  fields  of  fire.  Crewmembers  not  involved  in  CBRN  reconnaissance-specific  tasks dismount and establish security. Figure E-19. Herringbone formation at the halt  COIL E-92. The  coil  formation  (figure  E-20)  provides  360°  security  and  observation  when  the  CBRN  R&S element  is  stationary.  It  is  useful  for  tactical  refueling  and  resupply  and  when  issuing  element  orders. Security,  including  air  guards  and  dismounted  personnel,  is  posted  during  the  execution  of  CBRN reconnaissance tasks. The coil formation is used as follows:   When  visibility  is  limited,  the  element  leader  forms  the  coil.  When  the  coil  is  complete,  all vehicles stop, adjust for cover and concealment, turn 90° outward, and post security.   During daylight, or when speed is essential, the element leader signals for vehicles to move into position  and  stop.  Other  vehicles  move  directly  to  their  assigned  positions  (as  stated  in  the element SOP), seek cover and concealment, and post security. E-28 ATP 3-11.37 /MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 25 March 2013 Dismounted Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Reconnaissance and Surveillance Figure E-20. Coil formation at the halt  E-93. In  the  conduct  of  most  tactical  missions,  the  CBRN  R&S  element  moves  under  the  mission command/C2 of the element leader.  E-94. The  CBRN  R&S  element  may  use  one  of  three  movement  techniques  to  reach  their  objective—traveling, traveling overwatch, or bounding overwatch. TRAVELING E-95. The traveling technique is employed when speed is necessary and adversary contact is not likely. The CBRN  R&S  element  moves  in  a  column  formation,  using  the  appropriate  intervals  based  on  visibility, terrain,  and  weapons  ranges.  When  using  vehicles,  the  CBRN  R&S  element  moves  continuously  at  a maximum  safe  speed.  When  the  column  stops,  vehicles  move  into  a  herringbone  or  coil  formation  and dismount. The CBRN R&S element moves along covered and concealed routes, automatically contracting and expanding based on terrain and visibility. Local security is maintained according to the element SOP. Each vehicle posts an air guard. The CBRN R&S element leader locates where he can best exercise control.  TRAVELING OVERWATCH E-96. The  traveling  overwatch  technique  is  employed  when  adversary  contact  is  likely  (possible).  The CBRN R&S element moves in a column formation, using the appropriate intervals and designated lead and trail elements. The trail CBRN R&S element moves continuously, following covered and concealed routes. When  using  vehicles,  the  lead  element  is  approximately  50  to  100  meters  ahead  of  the  trail  element, depending on terrain and vegetation. When on foot, the lead CBRN R&S element is approximately 25 to 50 meters  ahead  of  the  trail  element,  depending  on  terrain  and  vegetation.  The  trail  CBRN  R&S  element moves at varying speeds, stopping as required to overwatch the lead element. Visual contact is maintained with the lead CBRN R&S element at all times. The trail CBRN R&S element overwatches at a distance that would allow it to fire or move to support the lead CBRN R&S element if necessary. In wooded areas or restricted terrain, elements reduce the speed and the intervals. In adverse weather conditions, the crew of the  lead  vehicle  dismounts  to  verify  route  trafficability  and  maneuverability,  and  the  trail  CBRN  R&S element provides overwatch. The CBRN R&S element maintains local security according to the element SOP. BOUNDING OVERWATCH D-87. The bounding overwatch technique is employed when adversary contact is expected. The intent of this technique is for the element to deploy prior to contact, giving it the ability to protect the bounding CBRN R&S element by immediately suppressing an adversary force. Considerations when using bounding overwatch include:  25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 E-29 Appendix E The staggered column formation is the standard movement formation.     When  using  the  bounding  overwatch  technique,  the  overwatch  element  is  assigned  sectors  to scan. The lead CBRN R&S element bounds forward, following a covered and concealed route.  The  bounding  CBRN  R&S  element  should  avoid  masking  the  direct  fires  of  the  overwatch CBRN  R&S  element,  and  it  must  not  move  beyond  the  effective  supporting  range  of  the overwatch CBRN R&S element. The bounding CBRN R&S element may be a single element or multiple CBRN R&S elements.  The  overwatching  CBRN  R&S  element  covers  the  progress  of  the  bounding  element  from covered  and  concealed  positions,  offering  observation  and  fields  of  fire  against  suspected adversary positions.      Visual contact is maintained at all times. The length of a bound is based on terrain analysis and the ranges and fields of fire from the overwatching vehicles.    When  cresting  a  hill,  entering  an  open  area,  exiting  a  defile,  or  moving  through  restrictive terrain, a crewmember dismounts from the vehicle. He moves forward on foot to a point where he can observe all suspected and likely adversary firing positions.  The CBRN R&S element maintains local security according to the element SOP.  E-97. Regardless of which technique is used, the leader gives the CBRN R&S element an order explaining what each member of the element will do. This becomes more critical as the likelihood of adversary contact increases.  If  possible,  the  CBRN  R&S  element  leader  should  provide  his  element  with  the  following information:   The adversary situation as he knows or suspects it to be.    The next overwatch position (the objective for the bounding element).    The route of the bounding element to that position.   What the overwatch does after the bounding element gets to the next position. E-98. Selection of a movement technique is based in large on terrain considerations and the likelihood of adversary contact. These techniques provide a standard method of movement, but the CBRN R&S element must  use  common  sense  in  employing  these  techniques  as  they  perform  their  missions  and  encounter different  situations.  The  following  rules  apply  to  military  personnel  on  foot  and/or  vehicle  crews  using terrain for protection:   Do not silhouette themselves against the skyline.   Cross open areas quickly.   Do not move directly forward from a concealed firing position.   Avoid possible kill zones because it is easier to cross difficult terrain than fight the adversary on unfavorable terms.   Avoid large, open areas, especially when they are dominated by high ground or by terrain that can cover and conceal the adversary.   Take  active  countermeasures;  such  as  using  smoke,  direct,  and  indirect  fire;  to  suppress  or obscure suspected adversary positions. DISMOUNTED CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR SURVEILLANCE  E-99. Dismounted CBRN surveillance operations are generally conducted in the same manner as mounted operations. Although the term dismounted defines this section, there will be times when the CBRN R&S element uses vehicles to get to or near the location where the dismounted CBRN surveillance operations take  place.  Consideration  must  be  given  to  the  mode  of  travel,  OP  selection,  sustainment  and  relief, security, and follow-on mission of CBRN surveillance operations.  E-100.  Generally, a dismounted CBRN surveillance operation requires the CBRN R&S element to travel on foot to conduct operations. This is due to the close proximity of the area, buildings, roads, or personnel E-30 ATP 3-11.37 /MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 25 March 2013 Dismounted Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Reconnaissance and Surveillance that  the  surveillance  operation  is  targeting  and  METT-TC/METT-T  factors  that  are  favorable  for  the operation. When the CBRN surveillance operation is located at distances too far to travel on foot, another mode of transportation is used. Based on METT-TC/METT-T factors, the CBRN R&S element may travel by  land  vehicles,  amphibious  craft,  or  aircraft  such  as  helicopters.  When  traveling  by  watercraft  or airframe, the CBRN R&S element is dropped off at a predesignated location and then travels by foot from the drop-off point to the specified location. In that case, the need to protect and possibly conceal a vehicle is  not  an  issue.  However,  when  the  CBRN  R&S  element  is  not  being  dropped  off,  vehicle  safety  and concealment must be considered. Additional considerations include— Providing additional security for vehicles.    Taking  caution  so  as  to  not  be  heard  or  possibly  seen  by  the  adversary  or  others  who  may communicate arrival to the adversary.   Dismounting at distances that will not alert to the arrival.   Being compromised by civilians in the mission area. E-101.  CBRN  surveillance  provides  observation of  a  specific  area  for  indications  of  a  CBRN  incident. Based on IPOE/IPB and vulnerability planning, these designated areas are typically NAIs. The commander prioritizes the use of available CBRN R&S elements against designated NAIs; and CBRN R&S elements monitor,  watch,  and  listen  to  areas  for  indications  of  a  CBRN  incident.  Surveillance  may  be  conducted from OPs—positions occupied to observe a designated area. The CBRN R&S element occupying the OP reports any indication of a CBRN incident or adversary activity. Surveillance may also be conducted by routine patrols through the operational area. This type of surveillance is normally conducted in rear areas along MSRs and road networks. OBSERVATION POST SITE SELECTION E-102.  The supported unit leader or the CBRN R&S element leader selects the general location for the OP. The leader considers METT-TC/METT-T factors, the intelligence collection plan, and the ISR plan when determining the general positioning of the OP site. ATTACK INDICATORS E-103.  Hazards  can  be  disseminated  by  using  overt  or  covert  methods.  See  appendix  C  for  attack indicators. LOCATION SURVEILLANCE E-104.  Reconnaissance is the first step in location selection. Begin with a map reconnaissance. Use the map  reconnaissance  to  determine  initial  surveillance  areas  that  support  the  employment  tactic;  and  then select primary, alternate, and supplemental surveillance locations within each surveillance area. Some rules of thumb for the CBRN surveillance include the following:   Reconnoiter the detection areas and potential locations firsthand if possible.   Coordinate with the terrain owner before conducting the surveillance operation.   Ensure that the CBRN R&S element includes the designated serial leaders.  Select the location that provides the greatest concealment. DISMOUNTED CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR OBSERVE TECHNIQUES E-105.  The CBRN surveillance task of observing is accomplished by two techniques: critical node and area array. CRITICAL NODE E-106.  In support areas, dismounted CBRN R&S elements may be assigned CBRN surveillance missions to observe designated areas for CBRN incidents. MSRs and areas to be occupied by logistics and mission command/C2  facilities  may  also  be  checked  for  CBRN  threats/hazards  before  their  occupation.  Figure 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 E-31 Appendix E D-38  outlines  procedures  for  conducting  the  critical-node  observation  technique.  The  following  are critical-node technique procedures:    Occupy observation points to overwatch the designated area.   Report all indications of a CBRN incident.   Employ monitoring capabilities.   Operate and perform operator’s maintenance on CBRN monitoring equipment.    Conduct CBRN monitoring operations.  Provide data for the completion of CBRN reports. E-107.  Mounted  CBRN  R&S  elements  observe  specified  areas  or  NAIs  for  indications  of  a  CBRN incident. Based on IPOE/IPB and vulnerability planning, the commander prioritizes the use of available collection assets against designated NAIs; and R&S elements employ observation and detection procedures on designated areas for indications of an incident.  E-108.  The primary means of surveillance may be from OPs. An OP is a position occupied to observe a designated area. The mounted CBRN R&S element reports any indication of a CBRN incident or adversary activity.  Another  means  of  mounted  CBRN  surveillance  is  conducting  routine  patrols  through  the operational area. This is normally conducted in support areas along MSRs and road networks.  AREA ARRAY E-109.  An area array is established in order to maximize the probability of CBRN hazard detection over a large area of interest. The primary objective is to detect a hazard upwind of the operational area of concern and to provide the greatest potential warning to those in the hazard area. The specific architecture of the array is designed by the CBRN staff in close coordination with operations, intelligence and medical staffs. Refer  to  appendix  A for  more  specific  information  on  surveillance  planning  considerations  and detector employment tactics. The following are procedures for conducting the area array observation technique:   Consider threat, terrain, weather conditions, performance characteristics, and quantity of CBRN detector assets.   Determine the appropriate separation distances between CBRN detectors.   Operate and perform operator’s maintenance on CBRN monitoring equipment.    Report all indications of a CBRN incident.    Conduct CBRN monitoring operations. DISMOUNTED CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR MONITOR TECHNIQUES E-110.  The  CBRN  surveillance  task  of  monitoring  is  accomplished  by  two  techniques:  periodic  and continuous. PERIODIC E-111.   As the name implies, periodic monitoring is accomplished by employing CBRN detector assets at predetermined intervals of time. Prior to an incident, the time between monitoring is based primarily on the threat assessment. When intelligence estimates deem there is a reduced likelihood of a CBRN incident, the commander is more apt to call for periodic monitoring of the area of concern. In doing so, CBRN resources (equipment and personnel) are conserved and power consumption (fuel and batteries) is reduced. E-112.  Following a CBRN incident, the periodic monitoring technique may be utilized over an extended period to determine whether hazardous effects remain in the area. CONTINUOUS E-113.  Conversely, the continuous monitoring technique is accomplished by employing CBRN detector assets  uninterrupted  over  the  duration  of  the  monitoring  operations.  Similar  to  periodic  monitoring,  the threat assessment will be the prime determinant in deciding to apply the continuous monitoring technique. E-32 ATP 3-11.37 /MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 25 March 2013 Dismounted Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Reconnaissance and Surveillance When an incident is anticipated, continuous monitoring provides the greatest opportunity for warning the area of concern of impending hazardous conditions. E-114.  During  and  immediately  following  a  CBRN  incident,  the  continuous  monitoring  technique  is employed to note either the dissipation or proliferation of the hazard area and to estimate the duration of CBRN effects. E-115.  Continuous monitoring will place a much heavier burden on personnel (operators and maintainers) and  logistics  (detectors,  batteries,  fuel).  These  factors  should  be  considered  and  adequately  coordinated throughout the staff.  25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 E-33 This page intentionally left blank.    Appendix F Aerial Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Reconnaissance their  mission.  CBRN  aerial This appendix provides aerial CBRN reconnaissance TTP. The aerial mode of CBRN reconnaissance provides speed and added protection to CBRN R&S elements when conducting reconnaissance  operations  support commanders  and  their  staffs  by  increasing  situational  awareness  as  they  plan, coordinate, and execute CBRN R&S missions. Aerial reconnaissance could enhance many  missions  by  improving  CBRN  detection  capabilities,  obtaining  combat information about adversary and indigenous population activities and resources, and providing meteorological and geographical characteristics of key terrain. Currently, manned  aerial  systems  are  limited  to  radiological  sensing.  Unmanned  systems  for CBRN sensing and sample collection are currently not available. MANNED AERIAL RADIOLOGICAL RECONNAISSANCE F-1.  There is one form used to conduct manned aerial radiological reconnaissance—the route form. There are also two techniques used when conducting an aerial route, they are the course leg and preselected dose rate  techniques.  The  CBRNCC  briefs  the  pilot  and  the  R&S  element.  All  information  concerning  the mission  (survey  height,  ground  speed,  routes,  course  legs,  checkpoints)  comes  from  the  CBRNCC.  The survey team leader and the instrument operator sit beside each other to aid in communications. The survey team leader must have communication with the pilot.  F-2.  The aircraft flies to and lands at a specified area. The aircraft must land near the point of interest. The monitor  dismounts,  proceeds  to  the  selected  point,  and  takes  the  reading  by  using  normal  ground monitoring procedures. When high dose rates do not permit this procedure, aerial dose rates are taken using an air-ground correlation factor. There are two methods for obtaining the air-ground correlation factor—direct determination and use of standardized tables (indirect). Direct determination is the preferred method and is accomplished as follows:   An aerial dose rate is taken at a given point and height during the survey.   The aircraft lands and a ground dose rate is obtained at the same area.   The air-ground correlation factor is obtained by dividing the ground dose rate by the aerial dose rate.   New data must be obtained when height changes 15 meters or more or when ground foliage or surface conditions vary significantly. ROUTE F-3.  The aircraft flies between two checkpoints, following the route of a predominant terrain feature (a road,  riverbank,  railroad  track)  that  connects  the  two  checkpoints.  The  aircraft  only  lands  to  get  the air-ground  correlation  factor  data  needed  by  the  CBRNCC.  The  procedures  are  identical  to  those  for  a course leg survey; however, a straight flight direction may or may not be required. The following are aerial route procedures:   Determine the appropriate level of protection.   Obtain operational exposure guidance (turn-back dose and turn-back dose rate).   Reconnoiter the route and determine locations of contaminated areas along the route.   Report  all  chemical,  biological,  radiological,  and  nuclear  (CBRN)  threats/hazards  along  the route. 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 F-1 Appendix F COURSE LEG TECHNIQUE F-4.  The aircraft flies a straight line between two checkpoints; for example, from Point A (top of a hill) to Point B (top of another hill). The aircraft only lands to obtain the air-ground correlation factor data. The following are course leg procedures:   The  pilot  maintains  (as  near  as  possible)  a  constant  height  above  ground,  a  constant  ground speed, and a straight flight direction between the start and end checkpoints of each course leg.   The pilot flies the aircraft on the proper course over the start checkpoint and on a straight path to the end checkpoint. Shortly before reaching the start checkpoint, the pilot alerts the monitor and gives the monitor the height above ground.    The monitor records the time and height above ground. The monitor then rechecks and zeros the RADIAC meter before each course leg to ensure proper operation.    The pilot gives the command “MARK” when the aircraft is directly over the start checkpoint. The monitor reads the survey meter, records the dose rate, and begins timing preselected time intervals.   The monitor reads the survey meter and records the dose rate at each preselected time interval; for example, every ten seconds.   The pilot alerts the  monitor again when the aircraft approaches the end checkpoint. The pilot then gives the command “MARK” when the aircraft is directly over the end checkpoint.   The monitor reads and records the final dose rate. PRESELECTED DOSE RATE TECHNIQUE F-5.  The dismounted R&S element looks for a given dose rate or multiple given dose rates designated by the control center team. This technique is used for old contamination and neutron-induced radiation. For old contamination that is greater than the time of attack (for example, (H)+48), the team moves along a route or designated straight line in an area until it finds 1 centigray per hour and/or its designated dose rates.  When  conducting  a  dismounted  radiological  preselected  dose  rate  technique  the  element  must  be given  a  turn-back  dose  and  turn-back  dose  rate.  Reporting  results  of  dismounted  preselected  dose  rate techniques may be done in various ways. Normally, a survey data sheet can be filled out and turned in to the  tasking  headquarters  at  the  end  of  the  mission  or  the  data  can  be  sent  via  a  CBRN4  report.  The following are preselected dose rate technique procedures:   The  pilot  maintains  (as  near  as  possible)  a  constant  height  above  ground,  a  constant  ground speed, and a straight flight direction between the start and end checkpoints of each route.   The pilot flies the aircraft on the proper route over the start checkpoint and on a path to the end checkpoint. Shortly before reaching the start checkpoint, the pilot alerts the monitor and gives the monitor the height above ground.    The monitor records the time and height above ground. The monitor then rechecks and zeros the RADIAC meter before each route to ensure proper operation.    The  monitor  constantly  monitors  the  survey  meter  while  moving  along  its  designated  route. Under  no  circumstances  should  the  element  continue  further  into  a  contaminated  area  if  it reaches its turn-back dose or turn-back dose rate.    Upon locating a reading of 1 centigray and/or its designated dose rates the monitor records the dose rate and area.    The pilot alerts the  monitor again when the aircraft approaches the end checkpoint. The pilot then gives the command “MARK” when the aircraft is directly over the end checkpoint.   The monitor reads and records the final dose rate.   The CBRN reconnaissance and surveillance (R&S) element reports the results normally using CBRN4 report.   The CBRN R&S element coordinates for decontamination if required.   The CBRN R&S element rechecks and zeros the RADIAC meter before each mission to assure proper operation. F-2 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 25 March 2013 Aerial Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Reconnaissance Note.  Conducting  dismounted  radiological  preselected  dose  rate  missions  versus  mounted  or aerial  radiological  preselected  dose  rate  mission’s  results  in  higher  radiation  dosages  to personnel.  Further  guidance  on  radiological  aspects  of  conducting  a  preselected  dose  rate technique  can  be  found  in  MultiService  Tactics,  Techniques,  and  Procedures  for  Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Contamination Avoidance. F-6.  The advantages and disadvantages of aerial reconnaissance over ground reconnaissance for detecting radiological  threats/hazards  are  depicted  in  figure  F-4.  The  following  are  aerial  radiological  survey advantages:   A large area can be surveyed quickly.  Speed and flexibility enable surveys over large unoccupied areas, adversary occupied areas, and areas not easily accessible to ground troops.   Enables surveys of areas where dose rates exceed the commander’s operational exposure guide and are dangerous to ground survey parties.   Exposes personnel to lower dose rates because of the distance the aircraft flies above the ground.    Requires less equipment and personnel.   A helicopter and a survey team can cover more terrain than ten trucks with ground survey teams.  F-7.  The following are aerial radiological survey disadvantages:   Dose rate readings are not as accurate as those obtained by ground surveys.   Weather conditions, such as high winds and extreme temperatures, impact flight operations.   Dose rates for specific points on the ground are not provided by aerial surveys.   Resources  must  be  coordinated  between  pilots  and  chemical,  biological,  radiological,  and nuclear survey team members.    May impact external operations (for example, artillery missions).   Requires availability of aviation assets to conduct operations.     Terrain  restrictions  may  impede  landing  to  take  ground  readings  to  calculate  the  air-ground Increases vulnerability to adversary fires. correlation factor. F-8.  Once collected, aerial survey data must be processed in real time, to include data validation, spectral analysis, and mapping, so that results can be obtained within the first few hours or sooner after landing. This  is necessary  due  to  the  time  constraints  for  effective  response  in  the  early  stages  of  an  incident  or accident. Planning to collect and record aerial survey data includes defining survey parameters, such as the following:  Sample time.     Ground clearance.     Line spacing on a grid map. Speed. RECORD AND REPORT MANNED AERIAL RECONNAISSANCE MISSIONS F-9.  The CBRNCC relies on reports to construct and update contamination overlays including the COP. The CBRN R&S element must accurately record aerial radiological data as it may be used as evidence of violations of treaties and agreements. Examples of nuclear data sheets can be found in Multiservice Tactics, Techniques,  and  Procedures  for  Chemical,  Biological,  Radiological,  and  Nuclear  Contamination Avoidance.  25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 F-3 This page intentionally left blank.    Appendix G Standoff and Remote Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Reconnaissance and Surveillance This appendix provides standoff and remote CBRN R&S TTP. Standoff and remote CBRN R&S provides early warning and added protection to CBRN R&S elements when  conducting  their  mission.  This  appendix  will  discuss  the  employment, functions,  and  capabilities  of  standoff  and  remote  detectors  for  conducting  CBRN R&S, including active and passive CBRN detection technologies and other organic battlefield sensor systems, such as counter-battery radar and missile defense systems. Organic CBRN R&S elements may use equipment that is capable of operating in a standoff  and/or  remote  mode  through  optical  detection  methods  and  advanced algorithms detection technology. Standoff chemical detectors provide near-real-time stationary and on-the-move detection of chemical hazards. Chemical and biological standoff  and  remote  R&S  technology  provides  detection  capabilities  to  warn commanders  of  an  approaching  chemical  or  biological  aerosol  or  vapor  cloud  in sufficient  time  to  implement  protective  measures  before  the  actual  contamination arrives.  Currently,  fielded  CBRN  standoff  and  remote  R&S  technologies  are predominantly  passive  systems  that  detect  the  presence  of  chemical  and  biological hazards by completing a spectral analysis through direct reading of the environment or  analysis  of  a  signal  (for  example,  laser  induced  fluorescence)  returning  to  its source.  CONSIDERATIONS FOR CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR STANDOFF AND REMOTE DETECTION CAPABILITIES G-1.  CBRN R&S elements can use remote or standoff capabilities to detect the presence of chemical or biological aerosol or vapor clouds. The terrain and the adversary dictate which method to use and the level of detail possible. More than one method may be executed during a single mission. The standoff or remote detection  equipment  varies  based  on  the  situation  and  the  threat.  Equipment  and  system  operating instructions are found in applicable operator and crew Service and technical publications. G-2.  Chemical and biological standoff and remote R&S equipment may be operated from a dismounted platform or be integrated into mobile reconnaissance platforms that transmit the results to local and remote personnel via electronic information systems.  G-3.  Chemical and biological standoff and remote R&S equipment may also be positioned in a covered and concealed location with maximum line of sight (LOS) of designated key terrain (for example, NAI, TAI, or maneuver decision point).  G-4.  Land environment observation is the ability to see the adversary’s use of CBRN agents via CBRN reconnaissance detection methods, such as OPs or standoff detection devices. However, several factors can hinder  observation,  including  vegetation,  buildings,  relief  features  (hills,  defiles),  distance,  sensor capabilities,  employment  mode  (scanning  versus  staring,  stationary  versus  moving),  scope/size  of  the hazard, precipitation, temperature, humidity and cloud cover. The analysis of each limiting factor can be combined into a single product, usually in the form of an overlay that indicates the LOS. G-5.  The  operational  air  environment  is  the  operating  medium  for  fixed-  and  rotary-wing  aircraft,  air defense systems, UAS, cruise missiles, and some theater ballistic missiles. Consider the following: 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 G-1 Appendix G   Airfields  and  support infrastructures.  Identify  and  analyze  CBRN  reconnaissance requirements for support of air base operations.   Avenues  of  approach.  Identify  air  avenues  of  approach  for  standoff  CBRN  monitoring  and survey.   CBRN collateral effects. Atmospheric stability could play a key factor in analyzing when an adversary may use CBRN weapons. Production and storage facilities for CBRN weapons present special problems. For each known CBRN facility location, analyze the surrounding terrain and the  forecasted  weather  conditions  and  patterns  to  aid  in  modeling  postattack  dispersion  of contamination. (See MultiService Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Chemical, Biological, Radiological,  and  Nuclear  Contamination  Avoidance.)  A  more  accurate  determination  of  the hazard area can be made using a hazard prediction model and real-time weather data. Standoff detection. Identify standoff detection capabilities, and use IPOE/IPB to determine how their use can support mission requirements.  G-6.  CBRN  R&S  elements  equipped  with  standoff  LOS  chemical  detection  can  detect  between  the detector and the target area at ranges that vary based on environmental conditions and capabilities available to the force. They can provide a stationary capability to support standoff monitoring of NAIs specified in ISR plans. Standoff detection can be conducted as follows (figure G-1 provides a graphical representation of each):   Upwind  surveillance.  CBRN  R&S  elements  use  this  technique  to  reduce  the  likelihood  of exposure  to  a  chemical  agent  when  conducting  chemical  surveillance.  CBRN  R&S  element efforts remain focused by IPOE/IPB and the commander’s PIR and IR.   Downwind surveillance. This technique provides early warning to R&S elements who may be exposed to chemical agent hazards. The application of this technique must weigh the potential threat against the risk. The IPOE/IPB, risk assessment, and vulnerability analysis must consider the cost factor and the likelihood and impact of exposure of the R&S vehicle, crew, or element.   Crosswind surveillance. When CBRN R&S elements conduct crosswind surveillance, they are positioned to observe the NAI unaffected by head or tail winds. This technique is recommended when contamination avoidance is foremost and observation and sensing can be achieved using standoff sensors and dismounts. Figure G-1. Standoff line-of-sight wind positioning STANDOFF DETECTION CAPABILITIES  G-7.  Standoff detection is conducted to provide early warning of a CBRN hazard. It supports the CBRN Sense operational element that provides the commander information on the threats and hazards in the AOR. Additionally, it serves as a passive defense measure for military personnel to avoid contamination while implementing  protection  measures  and  to  mitigate  or  neutralize  the  effects  of  a  chemical  or  biological hazard. Standoff technology detects the presence of a chemical or biological agent cloud from a distance that does not require military personnel to enter into the contaminated area. Standoff detectors are capable G-2 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 25 March 2013 Standoff and Remote Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Reconnaissance and Surveillance of applying technologies (for example, laser technology or electromagnetic spectrum) that will measure the change in air and/or area conditions and convert information that is computed to distinguish a chemical or biological agent.  G-8.  Standoff detectors are passive defense measures to detect the presence of a chemical or biological hazard. CBRN passive defense includes passive measures taken to minimize or negate the vulnerability to and  effects  of  CBRN  attacks.  Currently,  standoff  detection  capabilities  focus  on  the  chemical  and biological aspects; however, new and emerging technologies will present a radiological standoff capability.  G-9.  In contrast to point detection, standoff detection provides greater warning time prior to the arrival or passing of a chemical or biological agent. On the other hand, point detection capability only detects the presence  of  the  agent  once  the  agent  is  upon  the  detector.  Standoff  detection  is  arrayed  in  many configurations to fit the operational commander’s needs. Standoff detection can be—    Used  in  support  of  CBRN  reconnaissance  operations  to  detect  and  locate  chemical  and biological hazards.    Used in support of CBRN surveillance operations to observe, monitor, and detect chemical and biological hazards.    Mounted on vehicles, watercraft, and aircraft for mobile operations in multiple environments.   Dismounted (generally on tripods) for stationary and fixed-site operations.   Employed for long-range and short-range detection (depending on the technology available).   Employed as a remote capability (see remote detection capabilities section). G-10. Standoff  chemical  detectors  detect  and  classify  the  presence  of  some  CW  vapors  under  limited conditions. Standoff chemical detectors—   Detect chemical agent vapors and can be programmed to detect a wide variety of other chemical hazards, including some TICs.   Detect the presence of chemical agents by completing a spectral analysis of target chemicals. G-11. Standoff chemical detectors allow commanders to monitor the AOR for chemical hazards. During periods of increased tension, detectors will be deployed at fixed sites, as mobile detection systems on and around  fixed  sites  (for  example,  main  and collocated  operating bases),  or  in  support  of  maneuver  units. Standoff chemical detectors must be positioned to maximize detection in designated areas, and they can be used in an overlapping field of view to provide triangulation and tracking of a cloud. Standoff chemical detectors— Search areas between friendly and adversary forces.   Monitor avenues of approach and egress routes.    Monitor bridges, road junctions, and other point targets.   Monitor barriers (minefields, obstacles, chokepoints).   Cue and vector the CBRN R&S element to or around suspected hazard areas.  Provide advance detection and warning (that is, area surveillance or unit defense) of hazards to units located adjacent to favorable terrain (that is, having adequate LOS). G-12. Standoff chemical detectors can be operated in two ways—vehicle-mounted and tripod-mounted. In the vehicle-mounted configuration, the detector is integrated into a mobile R&S platform. Military vehicles equipped with a standoff chemical detector should be positioned with maximum LOS to designated key terrain  or  routes.  The  tripod-mounted  configuration  is  addressed  in  the  remote  detection  capabilities section. G-13. Where possible, standoff chemical detectors will be employed in pairs (two R&S elements) so that one can use the detector in an overwatch position while the other is moving. The speed of the vehicle will impact the likelihood of detection before coming into contact with contamination. The sensors have a set time it takes to detect. Detection time and speed should be taken into consideration when operating while moving.  The  detector  can  be  used  when  the  CBRN  R&S  vehicle  is  moving.  If  the  standoff  chemical detector  indicates  the  presence  of  vapor  hazard,  the  R&S  element  uses  remaining  onboard  detectors  to determine the extent and type of contamination present.  25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 G-3 Appendix G   Standoff chemical detectors are used on mobile R&S platforms to conduct reconnaissance in the following roles:  Identifying potential routes that contain a vapor hazard. Providing overwatch for vapor hazards while other mobile R&S platforms search for liquid hazards. Searching an area for potential unit occupation (for example, assembly area) to determine the presence of vapor hazards. Performing a secondary role to provide warning of off-target vapor attacks at fixed sites.    In determining the exact location of vapor hazards, there are different types of chemical agents that  produce  varying  amounts  of  vapor,  depending  on  agent  characteristics  (see  multi-Service publication,  Potential  Military  Chemical/Biological  Agents  and  Compounds)  and  weather conditions.  These (O-Ethyl  S-Diisopropylaminomethyl  (VX),  and  HD.  Additionally,  standoff  chemical  detection  provides only the direction of the hazard, not distance information. To determine the actual location of a hazard, the unit may use one of the following techniques:   Single system. A single R&S platform (figure G-2) can stop for one and one-half minutes to take  information  from  multiple  detection  locations  as  the  vehicle  moves  along  a predetermined route and perform the map resections on all detections. This method can be effective when the wind speed is less than 10 kilometers per hour for a point release. agents,  nerve series  nerve include  G agent  Figure G-2. Single-system detection technique   Multiple systems. Information from multiple reconnaissance systems (figure G-3) can be combined. Using the direction of the left and right limits, a resection is performed on a map indicating the location of the hazard. This is the preferred  method, especially when wind speeds are in excess of 10 kilometers per hour, which creates a moving hazard. This method effectively  locates  point  releases,  such  as a  surface-to-surface  missile  system  impact  or  a limited artillery strike, but is less effective against a line release. G-4 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 25 March 2013 Standoff and Remote Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Reconnaissance and Surveillance  Figure G-3. Multiple-system detection technique   Cueing and vectoring. A reconnaissance system can follow the direction provided by the detector, vectoring in on the location. Other onboard sensors will alarm when contact with the hazard occurs. This is the least preferred method since it is the most time-consuming and provides very little useful information. It provides leading-edge information for one point only and may not be a true representation of the larger picture. Cloud locations can quickly change,  and  the  detector operator  may  have  difficulty  detecting  movement  when he  is  in contact with the cloud. Cueing and vectoring may be used to locate off-gassing from ground contamination,  allowing  a  reconnaissance  platform  to  begin  a  survey  and  determine  the limits of the ground contamination. G-14. When conducting fixed-site tactical employment, consider the following:   The tripod-mounted standoff chemical detector can be employed as a networked or stand-alone detector to detect a chemical hazard. Employment of the detector should ensure good visibility of upwind areas of operating forces to detect attacks and allow the commander sufficient time to take immediate action. Standoff  chemical  detectors  may  be  employed  at  airfields,  forward  facilities,  logistics  bases, support area command posts (CPs) and headquarters (fixed sites), and port facilities. They may also be used to detect chemical agents and provide early warning around MSRs and other lines of communication.     The  distance  between  standoff  detectors  is  based  on  the  terrain  and  the  threat.  The  distance between the fixed site and the standoff detector is based on the terrain, the size of the area to be covered, the radio transmission range, the desired warning time, and METT-TC/METT-T. Fixed-site  installation  of  detectors  should  exploit  available  terrain  and  infrastructure  to  the maximum  extent  possible.  Buildings  and  other  high  ground  should  be  exploited  to  improve visibility  and  limit  uncovered  areas  hidden  behind  other  structures.  Power  converters  may  be used to capitalize on the electrical or generator power available.    At  least  three  standoff  detector  systems  are  required  to  conduct  a  reliable  map  resection  and provide the hazard location (figure G-4, page G-6). If only two systems are used or if all three systems are placed in a straight line, the cloud location cannot be determined in many situations. Information provided by a standoff chemical detector is used by the CBRNCC or staff to help determine the status of the installation before, during, and after an attack. 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 G-5 Appendix G Figure G-4. Position of detectors for map resection  G-15. Standoff  chemical  detectors  constraints  include—they  cannot  provide  the  specific  location,  they cannot track moving plumes, or they cannot determine the distance to the leading or trailing edge of the detected plume. To maximize effectiveness and provide this information, triangulation with two or more detectors can be used. To perform triangulation, the fields of the detectors must cross or overlap. The basic detection grid could require four detectors to provide coverage for a small installation. A large installation would require at least six to provide coverage. Other constraints are—   Networking for remote operation. A detector can be networked to provide remote operation. Multiple  alerts  and  information  can  be  displayed  on  a  single  screen,  allowing  the  operator  to easily triangulate the estimated hazard location. This can only be done when a sensor-integrated communications network exists.   Locating the hazard. A detector reports the direction of a hazard based on the relative bearing from  the  scanner  position.  It  reports  the  right  and  left  limits,  elevation,  and  declination  of  a hazard, but does not provide the distance from the scanner or the depth of the cloud.   Tracking the hazard. A detector reports the movement of a hazard as scans are updated in the search  mode. Each detection  and  subsequent  alert is  treated  as  a  separate  event.  Tracking  the cloud is only provided when triangulation is available. Additionally, the detector may not detect low-level emissions, such as the levels associated with leaking containers and the off-gassing, from previously deposited/undetected hazards.    Detecting hazard plumes. A detector is designed to detect plumes containing selected chemical agents in vapor form. The operator must be aware of how the weather impacts the system. For example, a chemical agent that is cold or frozen may not produce enough vapors to be detected, rain  may  interfere  with  detection,  and  detection  of  some  agents  may  only  occur  within  500 meters. REMOTE DETECTION CAPABILITIES G-16. Remote detection systems are usually operated from a distant location through a communication link to a CBRN detector or monitor. The tripod-mounted variant is intended to operate in the operational field environment at static, designated locations and fixed-site locations near or around airbases and ports. These devices are normally designed to be recoverable. Emerging technologies allow remote CBRN detectors and monitors to be remotely operated on mobile platforms such as UAS, UGVs, and robots. With integration into  a  mobile  R&S  platform,  detectors  can  also  be  positioned  in  a  covered  and  concealed  location with maximum LOS to designated key terrain.  G-17. Remote detection is the capability to detect CBRN hazards away from the operational area. Remote detection provides advance warning before the arrival of the CBRN agent to allow time for contamination G-6 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 25 March 2013 Standoff and Remote Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Reconnaissance and Surveillance avoidance  and  the  implementation  of  protective  measures.  The  term  remote  implies  a  detector  that transmits a detection indication back to a remote location. The term standoff detector is used to specify a detector that can detect CBRN hazards at some distance away from the detector itself. G-18. Some  remote  detection  systems  are  capable  of  standoff  operations,  with  the  remote  being  fed  by tethered  line  or  relay  technology.  Most  remote  detection  systems  are  also  considered  point  detection systems that are used for CBRN R&S operations. Information on remote detectors are as follows:    Remote detectors must be positioned so that they have an unobstructed field of view. This may require elevating the detector scanner or sensor electronics module to a height that provides a clear view of the horizon.   As the individual fields of regard bisect, the detection event data from individual systems can be analyzed to provide triangulation.   Triangulation occurs when the fields of regard of two or more scanners bisect or overlap.   Triangulation  is  not  performed  by  the  system  software  or  computer  interface;  it  must  be performed manually by plotting the detection information from each detector on an installation or area map.   The  process  of  establishing  a  triangulated  pattern  is  accomplished  by  separating  two  or  more detectors by approximately 1,000 meters and focusing the field of regard so that they cross. G-19. Detection for warning provides warning in sufficient time to implement protective, preventive, and treatment measures before exposure to agent contamination occurs. Remote sensors can be used to mitigate the  limitations  (or  absence)  of  standoff  capabilities.  When  there  are  insufficient  automatic  standoffs  or remote detectors for chemical and biological agents, it is necessary to rely on available attack indicators and PVNTMED sample collection and analysis. G-20. Warning of an upwind attack may come from a force’s own upwind detectors or from other assets monitoring the upwind area—assuming that forces have the necessary detectors, have observed adversary activities  indicative  of  an  attack.  Lacking  the  necessary  point  or  standoff  detectors,  commanders  must decide  when  the  possibility  of  attack  warrants  an  increased  protective  posture  based  on  intelligence indications. G-21. Point surveillance is conducted for a specific period of time and oriented or focused on key terrain located on or off the installation or base property. For example, the detector would be focused into the wind or  toward  an  area  of  concern.  Point  surveillance  activities  may  be  dismounted,  fixed,  tripod-mounted, shipboard-mounted, or placed on mobile platforms. The technology used for point surveillance requires the agent  or  hazard  to  be  directly  in  contact  with  the  detector  and  equipment  decontamination  must  be considered. Point surveillance could require the detector to be within the hazard area to obtain readings. The  reading  may  be  routed  to  another  output  source  remotely  for  analysis  of  the  initial  reading.  Point detectors such as dry filter units that are not capable of being remotely configured may require personnel to remove, package, and transport filters from the detector location to the laboratory for further analysis. A positive reading drives initiation of the CBRNWRS. See MultiService Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Contamination Avoidance for additional information. G-22. Area  surveillance  provides  warning  to  friendly  units,  allowing  them  to  avoid  contaminated  areas before they pose a hazard to resources. It may be conducted while positioned around the perimeter of a fixed-site, such as an airbase. G-23. Fixed-site employment considers the installation size as only one factor in determining the required number of detectors. The airflow is another factor that could affect the number of detectors required. Tall or large structures (dormitories, hangars, fuel tanks) can obstruct airflow. Terrain features (mountains, hills, valleys) may also obstruct or affect how the prevailing winds flow throughout the fixed site. Simulation and modeling  capabilities  aid  in  and  maximize  the  positioning  of  detectors  throughout  the  perimeter.  Also, threat plays a major role in detector placement. For instance, if there is a threat of a line release upwind, then the sensors may be placed in the upwind side of an installation in a picket line. If the threat is from artillery, then the detectors could be placed in a box technique to ensure uniform coverage across the entire installation.  These  factors  must  be  considered  when  emplacing  the  detector  so  that  blind  areas  are minimized  and  the  overlapping  of  detectors  is  maximized  to  ensure  adequate  coverage  of  the  fixed  site through point or area surveillance. 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 G-7 Appendix G G-24. Vehicle-mounted employment can be used in and around fixed sites, and temporary perimeters. The advantages  of  vehicle-mounted  systems  are  that  they  can  be  easily  repositioned  as  needed  to  adjust  to changing environmental conditions and threat. A single system provides a circular ring of coverage around an employed location. In this situation, the system should be located as close as possible to the center of the location with an unobstructed field of regard. If there is a high probability that an attack will occur because of an upwind release of a CBRN agent, the system could be placed on the upwind edge of the target to provide  early  warning.  Multiple  systems  are  positioned  strategically  around  the  location  as  close  to  the perimeter as possible. For example, three systems could be placed upwind of a base airfield, and a fourth system could be positioned strategically on the base. Four systems provide a sensor perimeter (scanning diameter)  for  each  system  and  provide  an  outer  perimeter  (overall  diameter)  for  the  combined  field  of regard.  G-25. A tripod-mounted system can be used in and around fixed-site installations to optimize the sensor field  of  view  and  to  overcome  obstructions  from  buildings  and  equipment.  Consider  using  the  roofs  of existing buildings or structures to elevate the system. Key definitions that must be understood for fixed-site elevation include—  Sensor  height.  Sensor  height  is  the  elevation  at  which  the  sensor  is  placed  on  the  ground, building, or equipment to provide an unimpeded flow of air.   Ground intersect. Ground intersect is the distance from the system that the lower tangent of 10° will intersect the ground. The ground intersect is representative of the distance from the detector that  will  not  be  viewable  in  the  field  of  regard.  Always  consider  the  ground  intersect  when elevating the system. G-26. Shipboard operations provide a capability to alert, collect, and identify chemical, radiological, and biological  agents  to  support maritime  operations.  Biological  detection  technology  continuously  monitors the air for a significant rise in particulate concentrations and/or biological mass. If a significant rise over the background is detected, the instruments will automatically collect an aerosol sample and alert the ship damage control central of the need to collect the sample and screen it using a handheld assay for a possible presumptive identification.  G-27. The maritime biological detection technology detects and identifies biological agents. It contains or connects to navigation, meteorological, and communications equipment that is used to identify the location and sense the conditions under which the agent was detected. The maritime biological detection technology has the ability to detect and identify many agents (bacteria, viruses, toxins) during a mission. Biological agent identification is limited by the available agent reactive assay strips housed within the identifier, the ability  to  collect  enough  material  to  reach  the  identification  thresholds  of  the  assay  strips,  and  reagent interferents. It provides the ability to collect and save biological agent samples for later laboratory analysis.  G-8 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 25 March 2013  Appendix H Sample Collection and Processing This  appendix  provides  information  on  sample  collection  types,  media,  and techniques  for  CBRN  environmental  samples  in  liquid,  solid,  or  gas  form.  It  also provides the vital requirements to package these samples properly for shipment to a support  laboratory.  The  sample  collections  plans  are  discussed  at  length  in  this appendix,  including  leadership  and  R&S  element  responsibilities.  The  construct  of the  R&S  elements  and  their  equipment  are  described  in  detail.  This  appendix provides  information  on  sample  collection  procedures  for  CBRN  environmental samples in liquid, solid, or gas form and the associated requirements to package the sample for shipment to a supporting laboratory for theater validation. CBRN sample collection  is  a  key  step  in  determining  and  documenting  the  presence  of  CBRN threats/hazards.  It  is  applicable  to  peacetime  and  wartime  response  operations  to  a suspected  CBRN  incident.  CBRN  sample  collection  is  the  process  or  technique  of selecting, packaging, and documenting the collection of CBRN agents or materials. CBRN  sample  collection  supports  operational  intelligence  requirements,  and  the results are used to confirm or deny that an incident or an outbreak has occurred. The goal of CBRN sample collection is to collect a series of samples of suspected CBRN agents or materials that represent the original source, thus permitting CBRN incident analysis. Information collected while conducting CBRN sample collection is used to support protection, prevention, and treatment decisions. CBRN sample collection, in support  of  military  operations,  is  primarily  for  tactical  use  but  may  be  used  as evidence  in  a  criminal  investigation  if  personnel  are  trained  and  the  proper procedures  are followed.  Understanding  proper  CBRN  sample  collection, documentation,  and  tracking  procedures  helps  ensure  the  strict  preservation  of  the sample collected. Specific sample collection procedures vary depending on the local SOP/special  operations  group  and  the  supporting  laboratory.  If  operations  allow, sample  collection  and  decontamination  waste  should  be  collected,  containerized, marked,  and  transferred  to  the  decontamination  or  support  element  for  proper disposal.  Additionally,  CBRN  R&S  personnel  should  make  every  attempt  to coordinate  with  the  appropriate  laboratory  prior  to  initiating  sample  collection operations  to  discover  specific  requirements  for  sample  collection  (minimum quantity, container type, reporting requirements). SAMPLE COLLECTION PLAN H-1.  Appendix  B  described  CBRN  planning  considerations  and  appendix  E  discussed  dismounted reconnaissance  planning.  The  sample  collection  plan  discussed  in  this  appendix  focuses  on  the  sample collection plan developed immediately prior to actual sample collection operations at a specific area. The plan is normally finalized by the R&S element leader after the execution of an initial area survey.  H-2.  Because CBRN sample collection operations are unique, each sample collection operation requires a specific  plan.  Each  CBRN  sample  collection  plan  must  consider  the  expected  results  of  the  sample collection operation. The sample collection plan defines the—   Purpose  and  scope  of  the  operation,  including  the  objectives,  limitations,  and  pertinent background information.

For instance, waste could be left in the area or be collected, containerized, marked, and transferred to the decontamination or support element for proper disposal. SAMPLE COLLECTION RECONNAISSANCE AND SURVEILLANCE ELEMENT ORGANIZATION H-3.  Sample  collection  R&S  elements  may  be  structured  as  either  of  two  basic  organizations.  It  is  the responsibility  of  the  persons  involved  in  sample  collection  so  that  works  are  aseptic.  The  two  R&S elements are—   Two-person sample collection R&S element. A two-person sample collection R&S element is the minimum size that can be used. It places a large load on the “clean person” to document and supply the “dirty person” with the sample collection equipment needed, when needed. Using two people takes more time than when using three and must be conducted slowly and methodically to ensure sample integrity, safety, and proper documentation.    Three-person sample collection R&S element. Using three people as a sample collection R&S element is the optimum organization. It allows for initial QA/quality control (QC) and efficient documentation of the sample collection operations that occur. TWO-PERSON SAMPLE COLLECTION RECONNAISSANCE AND SURVEILLANCE RESPONSIBILITIES H-4.  The following procedures are provided for two-person sample collection R&S elements:   The sample collector (sampler or “dirty person”)—   Exercises overall control of sample collection.   Assists clean person with setup. Dirty person is considered clean unless they have touched anything at the target. Dirty person may continue to assist clean person until they take their first sample. Identifies what will be needed to successfully collect samples. Informs the clean person of exactly what is needed and collects the sample using appropriate procedures.    Uses laboratory tape to ensure that the sample collection container cap will not come off. After the sample containers are decontaminated, he will receive laboratory tape from clean person  and  wrap  the  laboratory  tape  around  the  cap  of  the  container,  ensuring  that  the laboratory tape covers the top of the container and the cap. Wrap in a clockwise direction, gently stretching the laboratory tape for a tight seal. The clockwise direction will tighten screw top caps more firmly. Places sample into an overpack held by the clean person. Be sure not to touch the outside of the overpack or the clean person.    Never  holds  or  moves  a  sample  over  the  clean  tarp.  Dirty  person  will  never  transfer  a sample from sample collection utensil to initial package over the clean tarp. Takes samples as close to the original spot as possible to reduce spread of contamination.   Removes the outer layer gloves, using proper glove removal technique, and secures a clean pair from the clean person. Dirty personnel may wear several layers of gloves to save time, by  just  peeling  a  layer  off,  but  personnel’s  dexterity  suffers  with  multiple  layers.  Glove removal will be done after each sample is taken, and before taking the next sample. All used gloves and used sample collection equipment will be discarded. Another technique that can be used when a limited supply of gloves exists is to decontaminate gloves and hands H-2 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 25 March 2013 Sample Collection and Processing iteration  of  sample  collection.  Caution  must  be  used  when  reusing after  each decontaminated gloves as they may have become damaged or worn through physical use or interaction with the chemical being sampled.   The assistant sample collector (assistant sampler or clean person)— Prepares the equipment that is needed to collect samples.     Hands all sample collection tools to the dirty person, ensuring not to touch any portion of the tools that will actually come in contact with the sample. Never touches the dirty person while handing equipment to them. Never takes any equipment back from the dirty person. This keeps the clean person as clean as possible. If clean person comes into contact with dirty person or a suspected dirty surface, the clean person will change gloves using proper glove removal technique. Is responsible for QA/QC.   Maintains the sample log notebook.   Documents the collection effort with still and video recordings.    Ensures that biological sample collection efforts adhere to standards for aseptic techniques. THREE-PERSON SAMPLE COLLECTION RECONNAISSANCE AND SURVIELLANCE ELEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES H-5.  The following procedures are provided for three-person sample collection R&S elements:   The R&S element leader (recorder)—   Exercises overall control of sample collection.   Maintains control of the sample collection kit.   Completes sample log notebook.   Assists the assistant sample collector.   Maintains the sample log notebook.   Documents the collection effort with still photography and video recordings.  Is responsible for QA/QC.   The sample collector (sampler or dirty person)—   Assists clean person with setup. Dirty person is considered clean unless they have touched anything at the target. Dirty person may continue to assist clean person until the first sample is taken. Identifies what will be needed to successfully collect samples. Informs clean person exactly what is needed to collect the sample using appropriate procedures.    Uses  laboratory  tape  so  that  sample  container  caps  will  not  come  off.  After  the  sample containers are decontaminated, he will receive laboratory tape from clean person and wrap the laboratory tape around the cap of the container, ensuring the laboratory tape covers the top  of  the  container  and  the  cap.  Wrap  in  a  clockwise  direction,  gently  stretching  the laboratory tape for a tight seal. The clockwise direction will tighten screw top caps more firmly.  Places sample into an overpack held by the clean person. Be sure not to touch the outside of the overpack or the clean person.    Never  holds  or  moves  a  sample  over  the  clean  tarp.  Dirty  person  will  never  transfer  a sample from sample collection utensil to initial package over the clean tarp. Takes samples as close to the original spot as possible to reduce spread of contamination.   Removes the outer layer gloves, using proper glove removal technique, and secures a clean pair from the clean person. Dirty personnel may wear several layers of gloves to save time, by peeling a layer off, but personnel’s dexterity suffers with multiple layers. Glove removal will be done after each sample is taken, and before taking the next sample. Used gloves and used  sample  collection  equipment  will  be  discarded.  Another  technique  that  can  be  used when  a  limited  supply  of  gloves  exists,  is  to  decontaminate  gloves  and  hands  after  each sample collection iteration. Caution must be used when reusing decontaminated gloves as 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 H-3 Appendix H they  may  have  become  damaged  or  worn  through  physical  use  or  interaction  with  the chemical being sampled.   Assistant sample collector (assistant sampler or “clean person”)— Prepares the equipment needed to collect samples.    Hands sample collection tools to the dirty person, ensuring not to touch any portion of the tools  that  will  actually  come  in  contact  with  the  sample.  Never  touches  the  dirty  person while handing equipment to them. Never takes any equipment back from the dirty person. This keeps the clean person as clean as possible. If the clean person comes into contact with dirty person or a suspected dirty surface, the clean person will change gloves using proper glove removal technique. SAMPLE COLLECTION TYPES AND COLLECTION CONSIDERATIONS H-6.  The  type  of  CBRN  sample  collection  may  vary  based  on  the  nature,  source,  type,  and  method  of dissemination  and  location  of  the  area.  Normally,  the  best  area  for  CBRN  sample  collection  is  where casualties have occurred, plants are wilted or discolored, or there are dead animals (fish or birds). This is not  always  the  case  when  dealing  with  biological  agents  due  to  an  incubation  time  period.  Other considerations include the following:   Environment.  Environmental  samples  (air,  water,  soil)  are  removed  from  common,  natural materials, such as air, water, soil, or vegetation. Solid samples (powders, paints, metals) may be useful if collected at an incident scene, impact area, blast zone, operating facilities, and areas where runoff may collect. The following environmental factors should be considered:  Fabrics such as clothing and upholstery may be another source for sample collection. Using a scalpel, personnel should cut a piece no more than 3 1/2 by 3 1/2 inches. For carpeting, the sample  should  be  no  more  than  1  1/2  by  1  1/2  inches.  Attention  should  be  paid  when securing this type of sample. If a fabric, upholstery, or carpet is stained or contaminated, limit the sample size to that required for follow-on analysis. Stones should be no more than 1/4 to 1/2 inch. These samples should be placed in a plastic freezer bag. The volume of stones should be approximately 200 to 300 milliliters. Samples  from  walls,  vehicles,  or  other  types  of  immovable  objects  should  be  taken  by scraping the contaminated surface and collecting the scrapings into a sample container.  Soil samples should be taken over a surface area 3 1/2 by 3 1/2 inches to a depth of no more than 1/2 inch (true required depth depends on absorption of substance into soil). Samples should be taken as close to the center of contamination as possible. Samples may be taken near bodies of fallen victims. Environmental samples that consist of plants, seeds, and any debris should be collected in separate containers.       Vegetables, leaves, grasses, and grain matter should never be touched. These require using scissors  and  tweezers,  forceps,  or  hemostat.  Particular  attention  should  be  paid  to  the discoloration or withering of the matter. Snow  samples  should  be  collected  from  the  layer  of  suspected  exposure  to  chemical  or biological  agents.  Should  new  snow  have  fallen,  coordination  with  the  weather  officer should be conducted to determine how much new fallen snow has occurred. This will aid the R&S element in determining how much snow should be removed before coming into contact with possible contamination.   Aerosols may leave little residue. Water, vegetation, PPE (especially filters), and dosimetry devices downwind from the sample collection area may provide useful samples.   Equipment. Sample collection R&S element should have enough sample collection equipment and  consumables  to  take  a  minimum  of  ten  samples  of  the  necessary  types  (vapor,  soil, vegetation,  snow,  or  water).  Also,  sample  collection  R&S  elements  should  be  equipped  with digital photography capability. Digital photographs of the suspect agent or scene are critical and may be sent electronically. H-4 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 25 March 2013 Sample Collection and Processing   Background. The background sample is collected away from the hazard area in an area that is known  to  be  uncontaminated.  It  is  used  as  a  comparison  sample  so  that  a  compound  is  not naturally  found  in  the  area.  Evacuated  samples  will  include  CBRN  samples,  and  routine background  samples  when  directed  by  higher  headquarters.  The  background  samples  will  be analyzed  at  the  supporting  laboratory  along with  the  actual  suspected samples.  The  following factors should on background should be considered:   The  sample  collection  R&S  element  collects  at  least  two  samples  of  soil,  water,  air,  or vegetation from areas that are approximately 500 meters upwind of an alleged incident area to ensure no downwind hazards have contaminated the source or area where the background sample is taken. Clearly mark background and contaminated samples.   Background  samples  must  closely  resemble  or  be  similar  to  those  presumed  to  be contaminated  and  collected  at  an  incident  area.  For  example,  if  a  CBRN  R&S  element collects  leaves  from  a  tree  in  an  incident  area,  the  R&S  element  should  collect  sample leaves from a tree of the same type outside the contaminated area. Background information for each collected CBRN sample must be detailed and clearly stated.  H-7.  CBRN samples fall into one of the three priority categories depicted in table H-1, page H-7, based on where samples are collected. The following are categories for sample collection priority:   Priority  I.  These  samples  are  of  bulk  agent  (contents  of  drums,  barrels,  final  laboratory products) and delivery systems.   Priority II. The environmental samples (soil, liquid, vegetation, and air) are from areas where alleged chemical, biological, and radiological incidents have occurred.   Priority III. This category is the acquisition of chemical, biological, and radiological defensive materials,  such  as  antidote  kits,  decontamination  equipment,  detection  gear,  and  protective equipment. SAMPLE MEDIA H-8.  The sample media is the physical state of the sample being collected and supports the quality of the collection. The following are general classifications of samples:   Air  sample.  Air  sample  collection  is  typically  conducted  to  determine  the  presence  of contamination.  Air  sample  collection  is  also  conducted  to  determine  the  background  for comparison purposes. Considerations are—   The  concentration  of  contaminants  at  a  sample  area  depends  upon  the  flow  rate  of  the contaminant  into  the  environment,  the  wind  speed,  and  the  physical  state  of  the contaminant, the terrain contours, and temperature as a variable.   Natural  and  man-made  terrain  features  such  as  hills,  valleys,  and  rows  of  buildings, sometimes aid the CBRN R&S element by channeling emissions.   When associated with a particular facility, the downwind side from the release point is a suitable place to collect a sample.   Water sample. In the event of a CBRN incident, water sample collection may be necessary so that  water  supply  sources  have  not  become  contaminated.  Take  a  minimum  of  four  samples; three samples of the suspected contamination and one control sample from a nearby unaffected (uncontaminated)  area  for  reference.  The  additional  samples  allow  for  greater  analysis  of  the contamination.    Collect  samples  at  various  depths  to  obtain  the  most  complete  assessment  of  the contamination. The upper layers of water may have lesser amounts of contaminants, due to higher temperatures that promote evaporation and decomposition.    At a minimum, collect samples from the water’s surface and near the bottom of the water source. If an oil film, globules of organic materials, or a powder-like material is visible on the water’s surface, ensure this material is sampled.  Soil sample. Soil samples are used to determine the nature and extent of contamination and to identify  hazardous  substance  source  areas.  Personnel  should  consider  collecting  duplicate samples, especially for evidentiary purposes. The duplicate sample is one that has been collected  25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 H-5 Appendix H at the same area and time as the original and that may be analyzed by another accepted analytical technique or qualified laboratory in order to compare results. Duplicate samples should be stored in the event that one sample is destroyed during analytical testing in the laboratory or in transit.   Bulk sample. Bulk samples are classified as solids, liquids, and powders taken from containers, tubs, and drums. Bulk samples are not to be confused with water or soil samples. For example, liquid  samples  contain  a  higher  concentration  of  some  other  substance  or  product  such  as petroleum and solvents. Examples of solids samples are stones, fixed structures (for example, buildings  and  paved  surfaces),  pastes,  metals,  carpets,  or  gels.  However,  most  laboratories cannot  process  certain  forms  of  bulk  samples.  The  receiving  laboratory  should  be  contacted before  bulk  samples  are  collected  to  determine  whether  such  samples  will  be  accepted,  the recommended  collection  method,  and  the  quantity  needed.  Considerations  for  bulk  sample collection are—   When collecting substances and transferring to sample container caution should be used (for example, the powder or liquid substance may react to the sample container).   Bulk sample collection will be completed at the discretion of the commander. It should be noted however, that this approach does not require that a sample drum should be collected and packaged for transport. If  large  amounts  are  transported  to  the  laboratory  for  further  analysis,  additional coordination will be required for the disposal of the unused portion.    Surface sample. The surface sample is primarily associated with contact hazards and consists of metals,  dust  particles,  and/or  unseen  materials  that  collect  on  surfaces.  These  surfaces  may include floors, windowsills, or automobiles. Due to the physical state of the surface, the sample collection R&S element must be properly equipped should they encounter the following types of surfaces:   Hard and smooth nonporous surfaces (the ideal surface).  Soft rough porous substrates. Fragile substrates (a surface on which an organism grows or is attached).    Oily and/or grossly contaminated surfaces.   Dermal (pertaining to the skin) sample collection. SAMPLE COLLECTION MEDIA TECHNIQUES AND GUIDELINES H-9.  Air/vapor is a good sample matrix since it is a well-mixed medium. Air/vapor from a sample area contains a variable concentration of contaminants. The concentration of contaminants depends on the flow rate of the contaminant into the environment, the wind speed, the physical state of the contaminant, the terrain contours, and temperature as a variable. (See table H-1.)   H-6 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 25 March 2013 Sample Collection and Processing Table H-1. Chemical, biological, and radiological air/vapor sample collection information Air/vapor sample collection for chemical, biological, and radiological agents When to sample Where to sample How to sample  Perform sample collection as soon as possible after alleged use of a chemical, biological, and radiological agent. The optimum place to obtain samples is as close to the emission source as possible.  The farther away from the point of release, the more diluted the sample becomes from mixing with water, air, or environmental pollutants. Natural and man-made terrain features, such as hills, rows of buildings, and valleys, sometimes aid the R&S element by channeling emissions. When these features are close to a particular facility, use the downwind side (if possible), as emissions remain concentrated due to the channeling affect.  The sample collection R&S element determines the downwind area and collects environmental samples from that area. For collection in a possibly contaminated area, use a chemical agent detector kit to determine if a vapor hazard exists. Collect an air sample for laboratory analysis when a vapor, aerosol, or airborne particle hazard is unknown or suspected. Air samplers enable the R&S element to obtain vapor, aerosol, or airborne particle samples.  Explosive ordnance disposal personnel must render munitions safe prior to taking any type of sample from munition surfaces. Contaminants are sampled for later identification by using devices that draw air through filter material.  Sample collection personnel should not use cologne, perfume, insect repellent, medical creams, or strong soaps while taking an air sample. These fragrances mimic volatile organic compounds that can be absorbed on the filter and skew analytical results.  Smoke products can also interfere with air sample collection; therefore, avoid cigarette, vehicle exhaust, and campfire smoke. Shipboard sample collection operations must consider the products (for example, fuels, solvents, and gases) that are present and can cause false readings.  Another method for collecting air samples is with devices such as automatic air samplers. Employ device for three to four minutes, when possible. Upon completion of sample collection, place the tube in a sealable bag and seal the bag with pressure-sensitive tape. Place the bag into a second bag, and use any type of tape to secure it. Decontaminate each layer of packaging with a 5 percent chlorine solution. Whatever is used (for example, sodium hypochlorite or calcium hypochlorite) the strength should be measured to create 5 percent chlorine solution. (See Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Decontamination, or Naval Ships’ Technical Manual, Chapter 470 – Shipboard BW/CW Defense and Countermeasures for directions on how to mix a 5% chlorine solution.) When possible, record the ambient temperature, barometric pressure, wind direction, and wind velocity when air sample collection is begun and when the sample collection ends. H-10. The collection of water (table H-2, page H-8, and table H-3, page H-9) involves the collection of a sufficient number of samples to properly analyze the source with regard to contaminants. Water samples are  collected  by  PVNTMED  personnel/bioenvironmental  engineers  for  identification  or  verification  of biological  contamination.  At  least  four  samples  should  be  taken—three  samples  of  the  suspected contamination and one control sample—from a nearby, uncontaminated area for reference. Table H-2. Water sample collection information (chemical/biological) Water sample collection for chemical/biological agents When to sample Water from a facility should be sampled when intelligence or local reports suggest that possible chemical or biological production or storage occurs at the facility or a chemical-biological incident has occurred there. 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 H-7 Appendix H Where to sample How to sample Collect water samples from allegedly contaminated areas just after the start of a rainstorm when runoff is beginning. Natural surface drainage will concentrate any remnants of toxic compounds in depressions, streams, or ditches.  Because of their large surface area and the potential for collecting runoff from an incident area, ponds, streams, reservoirs, or puddles in the immediate area of a suspected incident are potential sources of useful samples. Water discharge pipes from suspected facilities should be sampled directly. Drainage areas are ideal sample collection areas since contamination and dilution from other sources is minimized. Samples should be collected as close to the potential contamination area as possible since mixing may not have occurred. Multiple samples should be taken, one from the water surface and several from different depths. At a minimum, samples should be collected from the water surface and at the bottom of the water column in slow moving areas. Preferably, the R&S element should sample various parts of a stream to capture different water velocities, water body depth, and other variables. Avoid extremely turbulent and rapidly moving areas as this may affect contaminant concentration and detection. If an oil stain-like fan, globules of organic materials, or an unnatural-looking powder is visible on surface water, take surface samples. Most chemicals of interest are denser than water and usually sink to lower levels. However, high water temperatures promote decomposition and may cause the upper layers of water to harbor contaminants (blister agent [mustard] may float on the surface of water due to surface tension, even though it is heavier than water). The R&S element may also collect samples from stagnant pools of water if the pools of water are part of chemical waste areas (a landfill, a chemical disposal area). Chemicals may percolate into stagnant pools or dumps close to the area. The samples can be taken with a 50 to 100 milliliter pipette (or syringe) from the source surface. Use one pipette per sample, transfer the contents into a separate clean sample bottle (retaining any material suspended in the water), and close the bottle (airtight). A sample size of at least 50 milliliter is needed. If the sample container is not prepreserved, collect the sample by immersing a capped container or a container with a stopper to the desired depth, removing the cap or stopper, letting the container fill, and recapping the container. An alternate method for deep-water sample collection is to use a plastic, pump-operated siphon to pump water from a specific depth. Besides water samples, surface scum and bottom sediment can also be sampled and forwarded for analysis. If there is a belief that the adversary has used chemical agents during an incident, use a chemical-agent water test kit for sample collection. This kit will provide gross-level detection of chemical agents but is not an alternative to collecting samples for laboratory analysis.

Water sample collection information (radiological) Water sample collection for radiological agents Intelligence assets will provide information on the presence of indicators that may show the need for sample collection (such as higher than normal amounts of security, increased flow of smoke from a facility chimney, or water from water discharge pipes). The best time to collect water samples from an allegedly contaminated area is just after the start of a rainstorm when runoff is beginning. Natural surface drainage will concentrate any remnants of radionuclides in depressions, streams, or ditches. The R&S element should sample various parts of a stream to capture different water velocities, water body depth, and other variables. Avoid extremely turbulent and rapidly moving areas as this may affect contaminant concentration and detection. The R&S element may also collect samples from stagnant pools of water, if the pools of water are part of chemical waste areas, such as a landfill or a chemical disposal area. Contaminants may percolate into stagnant pools or dumps close to the area. If the collector believes that radiological particles are present, he should use currently fielded RADIAC equipment to confirm contamination. If deemed safe enough to collect samples, then use one of the following methods to collect samples: • How to sample • The samples can be taken with a pipette (or syringe) from the source surface. Use one pipette per sample, transfer the contents into a separate clean sample bottle (retaining any material suspended in the water), and close the bottle (airtight). A sample size of at least 50 milliliters is needed. If the sample container is not preserved, collect the sample by immersing a capped container or a container with a stopper to the desired depth, removing the cap or stopper, letting the container fill, and then recapping the container. •  An alternate method for deep-water sample collection is to use a plastic, pump-operated siphon to pump water from a specific depth. •  Besides water samples, surface scum and bottom sediment can also be sampled and forwarded for analysis. H-11.   When uncapping the bottle or container, hold the bottle or container near the bottom and the cap near the top edge. Do not allow anything to touch the inside of the cap. Do not set the cap down. Do not rinse the bottle or cap. If the bottle becomes contaminated (for example, if the threads are touched or hit on the stream bottom), discard it.    Step  1.  Hold  the  bottle  near  its  base  and  plunge  it  below  the  water  surface  with  the  opening pointing downward. Collect the sample from the desired depth (see figure H-1, page H-10).  Step  2.  Turn  the  bottle  underwater  into  the  current,  and  ensure  that  is  it  turned  away.  In slow-moving streams, push the bottle underneath the surface, and ensure that it is pointed away and in an upstream direction. Step 3. Remove the bottle from the water when it is filled to the shoulder. Two-thirds of the way full is also acceptable.  Note. Do not discard the sample if the sample collection container contains a preservative. If a preservative is present, the sampler must choose a sample collection method that conserves the preservative. If the water level in the bottle is over full (there is no air pocket), quickly flick the bottle until the sample level falls enough to create headspace. If more than a few seconds pass, cap and shake the bottle before flicking.  Step 4. Recap the bottle carefully without touching the sample inside. 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 H-9 Appendix H Figure H-1. Water collection technique  H-12. Soil is a good medium to sample (table H-4 and table H-5) for toxic organic compounds. Soil may contain large amounts of compounds of interest. For best results, it is essential that the collector from the R&S  element  sample  at  the  precise  area  of  compound  deposition.  Soil  is  a  good  medium  to  collect radiological particles (dust or pellets). It is essential that the sample collector monitor the sample before collecting it to ensure that the sample is contaminated with low enough levels of radiation to be safe for transport and will not exceed his OEG.  Table H-4. Soil sample collection information (chemical/biological) When to sample Where to sample How to sample Soil sample collection for chemical or biological agents The R&S element should sample as soon as possible after the alleged chemical or biological incident. Contamination may be recognized by discoloration or apparent deposition of material on the soil’s surface. If discoloration or deposition of material is evident, use a garden trowel or wooden tongue depressor to scrape up the soil. Collect only discolored soil or deposited materials, if possible. Multiple samples should be taken at different depths. Avoid direct contact with the sample by wearing the appropriate protective equipment.  The R&S element may take soil samples using a knife, spoon, spatula, or similar item by scraping into a collection container the top 2 to 5 centimeters of soil from areas that appear to be contaminated. If the R&S element samples chunks or clods of earth, select those that are no larger than 10 x 5 x 1 centimeters.  Collect a control sample from a sample control point of the same soil type or texture from a nearby, uncontaminated area. Normally 500 meters from actual sample point.  Use a glass bottle, container, or nonstick container as a container when available. Plastic bags may also be used. When using glass bottles, containers, or nonstick plastic containers, seal the cap with pressure-sensitive tape and mark for identification.  Place the soil sample in one bag, push excess air out, and seal by folding over open end two to three times and wrapping with any tape when using plastic bags. Insert the first bag into a second bag, seal, tape, and mark for identification. If possible, place samples in a shielded container.  It is important to seal well so volatiles do not escape.

Soil sample collection information (radiological) Soil sample collection for radiological materials Sample as soon as possible after the alleged radiological incident or report of activity. Collect radiological agent samples from any place where RADIAC equipment indicates contamination (hot). If radiological deposits or material are evident, use a garden trowel or the scoop provided in the soil sample collection kit to scrape up the soil. Collect only contaminated (hot) soil, if possible. Avoid direct contact with the sample. Adequate respiratory protection is especially important whenever dry radioactive material samples are collected due to the risk of inhaling resuspended radioactive material. Collect soil samples by scraping the material into a collection container from contaminated areas. Collect a background (uncontaminated) sample of soil of the same type or texture from a sample control point normally 500 meters from the sample collection area. Scrape the soil into a collection container using a knife, spoon, spatula, or similar item. When using glass bottles or containers, seal the cap with pressure-sensitive tape and mark for identification. Place sample in one bag, push excess air out, and seal by folding over open end two to three times and wrapping with any tape when using plastic bags. Insert first bag into a second bag, seal, tape, and mark for identification. If possible, place samples in a shielded container. Place a tamper-resistant seal across storage bags.   H-13. Although  not  categorized  as  media,  vegetation  provides  an  excellent  means  for  collecting  CBRN samples. Collect samples of vegetation that are not consistent with healthy plants or plant material that is in the process of natural decay. (See tables H-6 and table H-7, page H-12) Table H-6. Vegetation sample collection information (chemical/biological) When to sample Where to sample Vegetation sample collection for chemical or biological agents The R&S element should sample as soon as possible after the alleged chemical or biological incident. When the center of the incident in an area has been determined, collect vegetation from that area and approximately 100 meters upwind of the area. Also, take samples at several 100-meter increments downwind of the area. If the R&S element can discern a contamination pattern in the area, this should be reported.  25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 H-11 Appendix H Table H-6. Vegetation sample collection information (chemical/biological) (continued) How to sample Vegetation sample collection for chemical or biological agents Make a visual survey of the area and don protective equipment before collecting contaminated vegetation. Enter the area from an upwind direction.  Select leaves that have wilted or appear to have been chemically burned.  Collect vegetation that has liquid or solid substances deposited on its surfaces. This may appear as a shiny or moist area.  Collect vegetation at several places within the suspected contaminated area. Horizontal surfaces are the preferred sample collection areas. Use a cutting tool or any sharp object and cut several contaminated leaves or a handful of grass whenever possible. Do not crush the sample. Place the vegetation sample into a zipper lock bag. Squeeze excess air out of the bag and seal. Fold opened end of the bag two to three times and wrap with tape. The minimum size sample of value is three leaves or three handfuls of grass. One leaf would be of little value, but should be collected. Tree bark is an acceptable sample but not preferred. Mark the bag for identification. Take a control sample of similar material from an unaffected area. Seal, tape, and mark the control sample. Ensure that each layer of packaging is decontaminated using a 5% chlorine solution.

Use a cutting tool or any sharp object and cut contaminated leaves or grass whenever possible.  Place at least three liters of densely packed sample in plastic bags or in a 1-gallon wide-mouth plastic container.  Double-pack the plastic bag or place the 1-gallon wide-mouthed plastic container in a plastic bag.  Mark the bag for identification.  Collect a control sample of similar material from an unaffected area at a sample control point normally 500 meters away from the sample collection area.  Seal, tape, and mark the control samples. Note. The minimum quantity of a vegetation sample necessary for analysis is at least three liters per sample. H-14. A  bulk  sample  is  a  quantity  of  material,  sufficient  to  run  laboratory  analysis  to  determine  the composition. The volume or quantity needed is dependent on the type of material and the type of analysis required.  A  bulk  sample  consists  of  suspicious  powders,  liquids,  and  solids.  Bulk  samples  of  building materials  such  as  sections  of  carpet,  office  equipment,  and  supplies  can  also  be  taken.  The  receiving laboratory’s  capabilities  to  process  bulk  samples  should  be  considered.  The  commander’s  staff  must coordinate with the receiving laboratory as to the bulk sample size, quantity, and type that can be processed H-12 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 25 March 2013 Sample Collection and Processing and  accepted.  Other  considerations  include  the  hazard  severity  of  the  sample,  the  sample  collection expertise, and transport requirements. Factors include—      Sample size. Sealing and packaging large samples may become difficult. Sample  quantity.  Collecting  too  much  or  too  large  of  a  sample  may  exceed  the  limit  for laboratory  personnel  to  process  and  their  ability  to  properly  dispose  of  unused  contaminated portion of sample. Sample safety. Opening some containers may cause more harm when exposed to other elements in the immediate environment. Sample  collection  expertise.  Collecting  suspicious  material  may  require  higher  levels  of expertise and capacity to collect, contain, and limit further damage, harm, or contamination.  Sample  transport.  Establishing  and  maintaining  chain  of  custody  of  bulk  materials  when sample is transported by other means than the R&S element.  SAMPLE COLLECTION TECHNIQUES AND PROCEDURES H-15. Sample collection techniques are the methods in which the sample is removed from its original area and transferred to the sample container. The techniques are discrete, composite, grab, and surface. These techniques are associated with the physical state of the sample media.   Discrete technique. The discrete technique is used when the sample media is soil. A discrete sample  is  collected  from  a  single  point  to  obtain  a  sample  that  accurately  portrays  the  soil conditions at a specific area. Discrete samples are routinely collected to accurately portray the soil conditions at an area where a chemical spill has occurred and the spill is isolated to a very small area.   Composite technique. The composite technique is a mixture of multiple samples collected from a  defined  area.  The  samples  that  make  up  the composite sample  are  called  aliquots  (an  exact fraction of the whole). Composite samples are collected to accurately portray contaminants in soil in an area that may or may not be contaminated. Multiple aliquots are collected from the sample collection area identified from the sample plan, homogenized in a large mixing bowl, and treated as one soil sample. Composite sample collection produces an average value of an area when  analyzed.  Composite  sample  collection  is  commonly  employed  when  analyzing environmental areas for pollutants or screening large numbers of samples, such as soil and bulk sample collection at multiple places within a specified area. This technique may be used when sample collection occurs at the point of a chemical-biological incident to increase the probability of  obtaining  a  positive  sample.  A  disadvantage  to  this  approach  is  the  risk  of  dilution  of  the chemical-biological  agent  to  a  concentration  that  is  below  the  detection  limit  of  analytical platforms.   Grab technique. The grab technique is the basic and preferred collection technique in sample collection operations. Grab sample collection is defined as a single sample that is removed at a single point in time from one area. This can be contrasted with composite sample collection in which samples are taken at multiple areas at one time or over the course of time when combined. Multiple  grab  samples  carry  an  analytical  cost  burden.  Furthermore,  the  probability  that  the samples  will  be  required  as  evidence  in  legal  proceedings  substantiates  this  approach  as  the preferred technique.  Surface  technique.  The  surface  technique  is  the  process  of  wiping  surfaces  that  contain suspected contaminants with approved material (swabs, cloths, tape, and vacuums).   H-16. Once  the  CBRN  sample  collection  type  has  been  determined,  the  number  of  CBRN  samples  that must  be  taken  and  the  number  of  available  personnel  to  support  the  sample  collection  operation  are determined. H-17. The number of samples that must be taken and personnel available to support the sample collection operation are key factors in determining the technique to be used. Time constraints on the completion of objectives must also be adhered to. Three basic strategies for sample collection at a given target area are: 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 H-13 Appendix H    Random. Random, nonsystematic sample collection of the target or a portion of the target may be  used  when  the  specific  area  of  concentration  is  unknown  or  when  a  suspicion  drives  area selection.  Systematic. Systematic (or grid) sample collection is an objective strategy where samples are taken at predetermined intervals. Regular patterns of samples can rely on a grid structure or other type  of  regulated  pattern  that  is  superimposed on  the  target  area.  In  some  cases,  the  grid  can literally be demarcated with string or stakes. Judgmental. Judgmental (or selective) sample collection is a subjective strategy where areas are selected based on the assessment or determination of the sample collection R&S element. Often, judgmental  sample  collection  is  employed  to  take  a  series  of  grab  samples  from  the  areas considered to be the most likely areas of contamination.  SURFACE SAMPLE COLLECTION  H-18. Surface sample collection technique is the process of wiping surfaces with approved  material that will capture the suspected contamination. The surface technique of sample collection varies with the agent and  purpose  of  the  sample.  It  is  recommended  that  the  analytical  laboratory  processing  the  samples  be consulted  when  selecting  a  sample  procedure  for  a  specific  chemical  or  contaminant.  Surface  sample collection techniques also involve properly using the appropriate wiping materials of a particular surface such  as  a  filter  or  cloth,  which  is  then  submitted  to  a  laboratory  for  analysis.  Typical  materials  used  in surface sample collection include :   Glass fiber filters. Gas fiber filters are recommended for chemicals that are analyzed by using gas  chromatography  or  high-performance  liquid  chromatography.  Also  used  for  radiological wipes (for carbon-14 and tritium) being analyzed with a liquid scintillation counter.   Cloth sample collection smears (1 3/4 inch). Cloth sample collection smears (1 3/4 inch) are used for surface wipe sample collection for radiological material.   Paper  filters.  Paper  filters  are  generally  used  for  collection  of  metals.  Mixed  cellulose  ester filter discs or smear tabs or their equivalent, are most often recommended.   Polyvinyl chloride filters. Polyvinyl chloride is available for substances unstable on paper-type filters.   Gauze  squares.  Gauze  squares  may  be  used  for  organic  substances.  More  durable  than  filter media, especially when wiping rough surfaces.   Charcoal-impregnated pads. Charcoal-impregnated pads may be used for collection of volatile solvents from surfaces. Work by trapping solvent on activated charcoal. GENERAL PROCEDURES FOR COLLECTING CHEMICAL AND RADIOLOGICAL SURFACE SAMPLES  H-19. Preloading  a  group  of  vials  or  other  containers  with  appropriate  filters  is  a  convenient  method  to carry the sample media to the work area. (The smear tabs, if present, are inserted with the tab end out.) Clean gloves should be worn when handling the filters. The gloves should not be powdered. The following are general procedures for taking surface samples:  If multiple samples are to be taken at the area, prepare a rough sketch of the area to be swipe sampled.   A new set of clean, impervious gloves should be used for each sample to avoid contamination of the filter by previous samples (and the possibility of false positives) and to prevent contact with the substance.   Withdraw the filter from the vial or container with your fingers or clean tweezers. If a damp surface sample is desired, moisten the filter with the recommended agent (distilled water or other solvent).   Depending  on  the  purpose  of  the  sample,  it  may  be  useful  to  determine  the  concentration  of contamination  using  a  direct  reading  instrument  such  as  a  radiation  detector  (for  example,  in counts  per  minute  or  disintegration  per  minute  of  agent  per  area).  For  these  samples,  it  is necessary to record the area of the surface wiped (for example, 100 square centimeters). This H-14 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 25 March 2013 Sample Collection and Processing would  normally  not  be  necessary  for  samples  taken  to  simply  show  the  presence  of  the contaminant. GENERAL PROCEDURES FOR WIPING  H-20. Two techniques are commonly used for wiping—S-pattern and decreasing concentric squares. For each technique, firm pressure should be applied when wiping.   S-pattern.  Place  filter  flat  at  one  end  of  the  sample  and  wipe  in  an  S-pattern  over  the  entire surface. Without allowing the filter to come in contact with any other surface, fold the filter in half  with  the  exposed  side  in.  If  possible,  for  chemical/radiological  sample  collection  use  the same filter to rewipe the area at 90° from the first wipe, again using the S-pattern, and then fold it  inward  again;  see  figure  H-2.  Place  the  filter  in  a  sample  vial  or  container,  cap,  and  place identifying data on the container. Place the same identifying data on the area sketch and sample collection  form.  Include  notes  with  the  sketch  and  sample  collection  form  giving  any  further description of the sample, for example, tabletop or baseboard. Figure H-2. S-pattern surface technique    Decreasing concentric squares. Start at the outside edge and progress toward the center of the surface area by wiping in concentric squares of decreasing size. Without allowing the filter to come in contact with any other surface, fold the filter with the exposed side inward. If possible, for chemical/radiological sample collection use the same filter to repeat sample collection of the same area, and then fold it inward again, see figure H-3, page H-16. Place the filter in a sample vial or container, cap and place identifying data on the container. Place the same identifying data on  the  area  sketch  and  sample  collection  form.  Include  notes  with  the  sketch  and  sample collection form giving any further description of the sample, for example, tabletop or baseboard. 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 H-15 Appendix H Figure H-3. Decrease concentric squares surface technique  GENERAL SAMPLE SUBMISSION PROCEDURES H-21. The general sample submission procedure are as follows:  Submit  control  standards  and  samples  (for  example,  field  blanks,  background  samples,  spike samples, split samples, duplicates, laboratory blanks) as required by the sample collection plan or analytical laboratory’s protocol.   Obtain information for the analytical laboratory about adding solvent to the container containing the swipe sample. Samples for some substances should have solvent added to the vial or other container as soon as the swipe sample is placed inside the container. Submit the samples to the analytical laboratory with appropriate documentation, which includes a  chain-of-custody  form.  (Sample  shipment  procedures  are  not  covered  under  this  reference document.)  SURFACE SAMPLES FOR RADIOACTIVE CONTAMINATION  H-22. Monitoring for removable radioactive contamination should be conducted using conventional large-area wiping for qualitative analyses using a filter paper or equivalent over 100 square centimeters of the surface. Large-area sample collection is performed by wiping cheesecloth, muslin, or an oil-impregnated dust cloth over the surface. If tritium contamination is likely, collection should be done using wet glass fiber filters meant to be analyzed with a liquid scintillation counter. Under certain conditions, radioactive (tritium)  contamination  may  penetrate  the  contaminated  surface  and  then  return  to  the  surface  over  an extended  period  of  time.  The  following  are  procedures  for  surface  sample  collection  for  radioactive contamination:    Ensure that the collected samples are representative of the entire surface, with special attention  paid to likely points for collection of contamination.  Sample the following points of contamination:   Leakage points.   Rough surface areas.    Work areas.   High-traffic areas. Infrequently cleaned areas.  H-16 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 25 March 2013 Sample Collection and Processing SURFACE SAMPLE COLLECTION FOR BIOLOGICAL AGENTS H-23. Collect sterile surface samples of biological agents on large, nonporous surfaces such as tabletops, counters,  desks,  file  cabinets,  and  noncarpeted  floors.  The  following  are  procedures  for  surface  sample collection for biological agents:   Remove  a  sterile  3  by  3  inches  (or  smaller)  synthetic  (noncotton)  gauze  pad  (gauze,  sterile sponges)  from  package.  The  sterile  gauze  (or  other  sample  collection  item)  must  be  handled (removed  from  packaging)  with  sterile  instruments  (tweezers,  forceps,  or  hemostat)  to  avoid contamination. Premoisten the gauze with appropriate buffer solution and use aseptic technique to prevent cross contamination for dry sample collection.  Note. Consult the laboratory personnel that will conduct the analysis to determine which gauze and solution is preferred (decreasing concentric squares or S-pattern).   Wipe  the  surface.  Recommended  wipe  area  is  approximately  1  square  foot.  Avoid  letting  the gauze pad dry completely.    Make enough vertical S-strokes to cover the entire sample area, for chemical or radiological fold the exposed side of the pad. Make horizontal S-strokes over the same area. Place the sampled gauze in a sterile conical vial filled with buffer solution or sterile water to submerse the wipe and cap the vial.   Label the vial, and place it in a self-sealing bag.   Document the following sample data: Sample type.   Unique number or identifier.   Collection area.    Collection date and time.   Name of person collecting sample.    Map of sample area. Size of the area sampled.   Clean the outside of the sealed bag with a 0.5 to 0.6 percent sodium hypochlorite solution just prior  to  leaving  the  contaminated  area.  A  0.5  percent  sodium  hypochlorite  solution  can  be obtained by diluting household bleach 1:10 with water. For applications aboard naval ships, use a  0.5  calcium  hypochlorite  solution  prepared  according  to  guidance  provided  within  Naval Ships’ Technical Manual. Place the cleansed bag in another unused self-sealing bag.    Repeat all previous steps to collect another sample.   Change gloves between samples.  Prepare samples for shipping according to applicable guidelines and submit the samples to the laboratory for analysis. Shipping information can be found in the CFR 49 and in International Air Transport Association (IATA) guidelines. H-24. Table  H-8,  page  H-18,  provides  additional  guidance  for  determining  the  size  or  amount  of  the recommended  sample  for  chemical,  biological,  and  radiological  agents.  Background  samples  should  be about the same size as contaminated sample taken from an incident area.   25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 H-17 Appendix H Item Soil Liquid agent Diluted agent  50 milliliters 10 milliliters Water  50 milliliters (maximum) Vegetation Equivalent to 3 leaves or 3 handfuls of grass Table H-8.

Although specific sample collection procedures may vary, there are common guidelines that apply to any sample collection operation. Safety is the foremost concern during any sample collection operation as the sample area may be inherently dangerous and contaminated.   The administrative procedures assure a documented chain of custody and a detailed description of  the  collection  procedure.  After  laboratory  analysis  of  the  sample,  intelligence  personnel analyze the data to produce intelligence to support operational requirements. Identify  physical/mechanical  hazards  that  may  affect  the  sample  collection  operation.  Adjust sample management plan accordingly to mitigate hazard.    Ensure  that  the  sample  collection  area  is  clear  of  secondary  or  additional  devices  before  the sample collection operation. However, remain vigilant for the possibility that these devices may be present.    Do not conduct operations in a contaminated area without backup personnel present, who are partially dressed in the appropriate PPE, prepared to don complete PPE, and enter the area as an emergency extraction team.   Take the following steps so that contamination is not spread:   Establish hot, warm, and cold zones. Clearly mark the boundaries among the zones.  Identify clearly ingress and egress points after the zones are established. H-18 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 25 March 2013 Sample Collection and Processing   Establish  a  decontamination  area  in  the  warm  zone  for  personnel  and  equipment. Decontaminate sample collection R&S element members and sample containers according to applicable guidelines (as defined by the sample collection R&S element).  Place a disposable, impermeable sheet on a field table or the ground for the staging of sample collection equipment and containers.   Avoid cross-contaminating samples.  Prepare  prepackaged  sample  collection  tools  in  the  cold  zone.  The  goal  is  to  maximize  the quantity  of  time  the  R&S  element  is  able  to  spend  collecting  samples  in  the  hot  zone  by preparing the sample collection gear in the cold zone.   Collect  critical  samples  and  those  that  are  most  likely  to  be  lost,  destroyed,  altered,  or overlooked first; and then move them to the staging area.   Ensure that the sample collection tools are precleaned, individually wrapped, and sterile. Do not reuse or recycle them. Use them to collect a single sample only.   Avoid  contaminating  the  outer  surface  of  the  primary  container.  Test  the  container  for contamination if possible; for example, certain liquid military chemical agents can be detected with detector paper. If the container becomes contaminated, repackage the entire sample in an uncontaminated container. Place the primary container inside a secondary container for transport to the cold zone where it is packaged and shipped to a laboratory for analysis.     Decontaminate secondary containers before removing them from the contaminated area. H-26. Radiological  sample  collection  operations are  important to  determine  if  and where  a  threat uses  a radiological  agent.  The  collection  of  samples  and  background  information  must  be  as  detailed  and comprehensive  as  possible.  Each  sample  must  be  processed  and  analyzed  to  provide  data  for  analysis. Sample processing includes the collection, packaging, storing, transporting, transferring, and tracking of the sample. The following are included in the sample process: Note.  The  radiological  sample  collection  described  in  this  section  is  provided  as  a  guide. Specialized  units  may  use  more  detailed  procedures  found  in  references,  such  as  Allied Engineering Publication (AEP) 49.   A  threat  may  scatter  radiological  agents  as  radionuclide  dust  or  as  pellets  of  radioactive materials. Radioactive dust will cover vegetation, soil, and water surfaces. Radioactive pellets will not cover vegetation surfaces like a dust, but will remain on the surface of the soil. Also, pellets  will  sink  to  the  bottom  of  bodies  of  water.  The  R&S  element  can  take  samples  of vegetation, soil, or water to collect the pellets or dust.   Ensure that personnel involved in the operation have dosimetry devices and are dressed in the appropriate  level  of  PPE  according  to  Occupational  Safety  and  Health  Administration regulations.   The R&S element conducts a ground radiological search to locate the contamination. Since the purpose  of  a  sample  collection  mission  is  to  collect  radioactive  samples,  terminate  the  search after the radioactive area is found. The safety of the R&S element is a constant concern for the commander. The contaminated area may emit high dose rates of radiation; therefore, the R&S element monitors the radiation throughout the radiological sample collection mission and does not exceed the commander’s OEG turn-back dose and turn-back dose rate.   The  R&S  element  collects  radiological  contaminated  environmental  samples.  It  chooses  the sample  media  based  on  the  measurements  the  collector  makes  with  RADIAC.  Ground contamination may vary significantly from place to place. Local dose rate averages are helpful in choosing a representative sample collection area. Conduct soil sample collection after the release has ended. Be aware of the commander’s turn-back dose and turn-back dose rate guidance and of the hazards that may be encountered. 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 H-19 Appendix H SAMPLE COLLECTION PROCEDURES H-27.

Each  set  of  primary  and  secondary  containers  used  during  these  sample  collection procedures should be placed in a third container (also called the sample transport container) for transport. This third container may be a zipper-locked bag, rubberized bag, cardboard or plastic shipping box, cooler, or other container. The outside of each container must be decontaminated as packaging proceeds to avoid the spread of contamination. Take care to avoid contacting the sample with decontaminant or getting decontaminant inside the primary sample container. Also, IPE/PPE is assumed. SOLID H-28.

Radiological surface water sample collection    Step 1.  Receive  an  initial  briefing  and  assignment from  the  command,  obtain  the  appropriate equipment, check the instrument performance, and conduct radio and Global Positioning System checks when leaving for the assignment. Step  2.  Wrap  the  instruments  in  plastic  to  prevent  contamination  (except  for  the  detector window if there is one), preclean and bag or wrap the sample collection equipment, set the alarm levels of direct-reading dosimeters and dose rate meters, wear appropriate radiation protection equipment, and wear disposable latex or vinyl gloves, and change them between sample areas. Step 3. Collect one to four liters at each sample collection area unless otherwise directed. Some typical areas include recreation areas, public water supply intakes, places where water is used (or obtained for use) by animals (for example, cattle), and places where water is obtained to irrigate crops. Be aware of—   The concentrations across a stream or river become more uniform proceeding downstream. Even  so,  the  mixing  can  still  be  incomplete  miles  downstream  of  the  release  point, especially in large bodies of slow-moving water.   Radionuclide  concentrations  in  a  river  are  more  uniform  downstream  of  turbulence  (for example, white water), meandering portions of the river, and after variations in depth and width.   One sample collection point at mid-depth in the center of the stream should suffice if the stream is relatively narrow and the water is well mixed. If the sample is collected from the bank rather than midstream, collect it from the bank on the outside of a bend where the flow is greatest.   Composites are required in larger, poorly mixed rivers. This involves at least one vertical composite consisting of a sample collected just below the surface, a sample from mid-depth, and a sample collected just above the bottom. Notes. H-38 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 25 March 2013 Sample Collection and Processing 1. Lakes and ponds experience less mixing and have a greater tendency to stratify than streams and  rivers.  This  stratification  is  primarily  due  to  temperature.  For  best  results,  determine  the water temperature profile and sample the different layers independently. 2.  A  single  vertical  composite  at  the  deepest  point  in  a  small  impoundment  or  pond  may  be satisfactory.  In  a  natural  pond,  this  will  usually  be  near  the  center.  For  a  man-made  body  of water, the deepest point is close to a dam. Several vertical composites are required in lakes and large impoundments.         Step 4. Use the sample collection form to record the environmental conditions at each sample collection  area  at  the  time  of  the  sample  collection  and  include  the  weather  conditions,  the ambient gamma dose rate, the water temperature, and the flow rate (if applicable). Step 5. Don gloves and boots. Step 6. Dip a bucket or another collection device into the water, rinse the collection device and the sample container. If using a portable peristaltic pump, ensure that the line is clean before pumping, and pump long enough that the source of water has an opportunity to rinse the inside of the tube. Step 7. Don waders; submerge the sample container or collecting device into the water again; allow the container to fill slowly and continuously; avoid surface disturbance; avoid collecting bottom sediment, vegetation, or small fish; and do not fill the sample containers to the very top. Step  8.  Follow  the  procedures  below  using  a  long-handled  dipper  or  another  scooping  type collecting device:   Open and slightly tilt the sample container.  Slowly empty the sampler contents into the container using a new, clean funnel. Allow the sample stream to flow gently down the side of the bottle with minimal disturbance. Preserve the sample if directed.     Cap the container tightly, and wipe down the exterior surface. Tape the cap closed or seal it if specified.   Use an indelible ink pen to write the sample identification, area, date and time of sample collection,  and  the  collector’s  initials  on  the  sample  collection  container  and  the  sample control form. Step 9. Complete the necessary sample collection forms, and begin a chain-of-custody form if required. Step 10. Decontaminate the outside of the sample collection containers and apparatus by rinsing them with clean (distilled) water, and wipe them down. Be alert for oil, grease, or any other type of surface scum that might stick to the sample collection device. Step 11. Repeat the above steps for necessary replicates, background samples, and other sample collection areas. CHEMICAL WIPE SAMPLE H-48.

Packaging and labeling samples is as critical as the actual collection of the sample. Wear the proper IPE/PPE  when  handling  the sample.  See Multiservice  Tactics,  Techniques,  and  Procedures  for  Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical (NBC) Protection, including Change 1. See the applicable system-level technical manuals or technical orders for specific instructions on packaging liquid samples, such as sample vials or sample  bottles.  All  samples  must  be  packaged  in  three  layers  of  containment  to  meet  air  transport regulations (primary container, secondary container, and outer packaging). Package the primary container in absorbent material within a secondary container, which is carried within an outer packaging or double-wrap or double-bag the primary container for less hazardous samples. H-64. There  are  several  physical  and  chemical  characteristics  that  must  be  considered  when  selecting  a suitable  container  for  shipping  and  sample  collection.  Important  characteristics  include  the  container material,  size,  shape,  and  sealing  method.  Generally,  a  container  should  be  made  of  material  that  is chemically nonreactive with the sample and it should maintain physical integrity during normal handling and  shipment.  The  container  must  have  sufficient  volume  to  contain  enough  samples  for  all  analyses required of the sample and for several repeat analyses. It should have an opening that allows for easy filling and emptying of the container and that minimizes external contamination of the container. All containers should  be new  and unused. Containers  should be  able  to  be  written  on  or  able  to have  marking  tags or labels affixed to them.  H-65. To ensure an accurate analysis, it is critical that a sample does not become contaminated during the process of collection and transport. To avoid cross contamination, take the following precautions:   Work from the suspected least contaminated area toward the suspected most contaminated area.   Wear disposable gloves, and change them after taking each group of samples at one area (for example, discard gloves after collecting soil samples).   Keep equipment away from dirt, dust, soil, and surfaces that are likely to be contaminated. Put the equipment on a clean, plastic sheet.   Double-bag samples immediately after they are collected.   Clean and decontaminate the sample collection equipment after taking each group of samples and check for residual contamination, or use disposable sample collection equipment.   Avoid  cross  contamination.  Wipe  the  outside  of  all  containers  with  a  0.5  percent  sodium hypochlorite solution (use 0.5 percent calcium hypochlorite solution on naval ships). H-66. Depending on the sample media and the sample collection technique, the container selection must protect the sample and avoid further contamination. Container considerations are—   Collection bags. A leakproof, clear, plastic collection bag can be used as the initial container for samples, such as protective masks and filter canisters, individual antidote and decontamination kits, ammunition fragments, and other items that are too large to place in a sample container. It can also be used to package containers, which ensures a vapor barrier in case the container is broken in transit. It acts as an initial or secondary vapor barrier that prevents air from leaking in and  toxic  material  from  leaking  out.  The  following  are  the  recommended  steps  for  using leakproof, clear, plastic collection bags:  Step  1.  Verify  that  the  item  has  a  command  designated  sample  number  if  the  sample  or sample container is being packaged. Step 2. Carefully place the sample in a bottom corner of the bag. Step 3. Ensure that each layer of packaging is decontaminated using five percent chlorine solution Step 4. Squeeze the air out of the bag and seal it.      Containers and tubes. Glass, spun Teflon®, or polypropylene sample containers and tubes can be  used  for  collection;  however,  do  not  store  biological  samples  in  polypropylene  containers because proteins and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) may adhere to them. Use glass containers to hold small environmental samples. Use sterile polypropylene tubes to hold biological samples if no other alternative is available (such as glass). Use glass containers instead of plastic because H-52 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 25 March 2013 Sample Collection and Processing toxic  agents  may  leach  chemicals  from  plastics  into  a  sample,  introducing  contamination  and complicating analysis efforts. Shipping containers. Place samples in commercial, biohazard shipping containers for shipping.    Commercial air shipment containers. When the samples must be transported on commercial aircraft, IATA-approved sample transport containers must be used for shipment and delivery to the designated location. H-67. Samples submitted for analysis must be properly packaged, labeled, and shipped so that they arrive in an analytically acceptable condition. The samples should be maintained at 1°C to 4°C. Ideally, samples should  arrive  at  the  laboratory  within  six  hours  of  collection.  The  samples  should  be  delivered  to  the CONUS laboratory within 24 to 48 hours. If the biological samples cannot be delivered to CONUS within 48 hours, the supporting laboratories should subculture the samples and send the subculture to the CONUS laboratory. H-68. Standard polyethylene or metal ice chests are the most easily procured items that can be used to ship chemical-biological  samples.  Even  though  an  ice  chest  provides  good  insulation  for  samples  and  the coolant, place extra insulation and cushioning around the metal cans inside the ice chest. Plastic bubble wrap or foam rubber can be used with good results. H-69. For double-bagging or double-wrapping, the plastic bags or plastic container containing the sample should be placed into a second bag. Excess air should be removed from the bag. The sample bags should be carried within an outer container packed with absorbent material.  H-70. Any breakable containers should be placed in more rigid containers to protect them from puncture or breakage.  Commercially  manufactured  packs,  specifically  designed  for  the  transport  of  dangerous pathogens  and  approved  by  the  IATA,  are  widely  available.  The  following  should  be  considered  when transporting materials:   Material is placed in a securely closed, watertight container, which is then enclosed in a second, durable, watertight container. Several primary containers may be enclosed in a single secondary container, if the total volume of the primary containers enclosed does not exceed 50 milliliters. The following apply:   The  space  at  the  top,  bottom,  and  sides  between  the  primary  and  secondary  containers contain enough nonparticulate absorbent material (paper towels) to absorb the contents of the primary containers if breakage or leakage occurs.    Each  set  of  primary  and  secondary  containers  is  enclosed  in  an  outer  shipping  container (sample  transfer  case)  constructed  of  corrugated  fiberboard,  cardboard,  wood,  or  other material of equivalent strength.  Packaging  of  material  in  volumes  of  50  milliliters  or  more  will  comply  with  specified requirements based on the type of sample collected. The following apply:   In  addition  to  packaging  required  for  smaller  volumes,  a  shock-absorbent  material,  in volume  at  least  equal  to  the  absorbent  material  between  the  primary  and  secondary containers, are placed at the top, bottom, and sides between the secondary container and the outer shipping container.  Single primary containers will not contain more than 1,000 milliliters of material. However, two or more primary containers whose combined volumes do not exceed 1,000 milliliters may be placed in a single secondary container.     The  maximum  quantity  of  agent  that  may  be  enclosed  within  a  single  outer  shipping container will not exceed 4,000 milliliters. H-71. Supporting documents must accompany the sample with clear labeling on the outside of the package. When  samples  are  sent  to  a  laboratory  for  theater  validation  or  definitive  identification,  they  must  be properly packed and shipped to maintain security and chain-of-custody requirements. Evidence should be tagged at the scene as it is collected or at the place where it is received by attaching a locally-produced adhesive label or its equivalent. If evidence is placed in a heat-sealed bag, the tag on the bag may replace the adhesive label. Tagging, often referred to as a shoe tag may be used when labels disrupt the original state of evidence. In the absence of tags or labels, ensure that supporting documentation, at a minimum, contains  the  information  shown  in  figure  H-4.  To  prevent  confusion,  the  sampler  uses  the  sample 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 H-53 Appendix H identification  number  when  referring  to  the  sample  or  to  information  concerning  its  acquisition.

The following are examples of some of the key items used to properly package the sample:   A sample transfer case is used to transfer samples. Sample transfer cases can provide temporary storage  for  samples  pending  evacuation  and  should  have  an  internal  visual  temperature monitoring capability. Samples should be kept at a temperature of 1°C to 4°C during storage and transportation.   Vials and bottles are provided as part of each system and the associated sample collection kits. The container may vary in size depending on the system that is providing the sample.   Clear plastic bags to double-bag collection items.   Tamper-resistant tape.   Laboratory film.   Absorbent material. Note.  The  U.S.  Navy  uses  a  shipping  container  specifically  designed  to  ship  infectious substances. H-73. The following are steps for preparing a sample for shipment:      Step 1. Obtain the primary container that contains the sample. Step  2.  Mark  the  primary  container  with  the  sample  identification  number  using  an  adhesive label or by marking the container. Step 3. Seal the primary container first with laboratory film, decontaminate, and then seal with tamper-resistant tape. If applicable, apply two strips of tape across the top of the container in an X-pattern ensuring that the tape reaches down both sides of the container. Ensure that the tape covers  a  portion  of  the  label  on  the  container,  but  does  not  cover  the  sample  identification number. Step  4.  Place  the  container  inside  a  plastic  bag  or  International  Air  Transport  Association container  containing  absorbent  material.  Decontaminate  the  container.  If  using  a  plastic  bag, remove excess air, twist the neck of the bag until it forms a tight coil with the bag snug around the container, and seal it with a strip bag tie. Step 5. Place an adhesive label containing the sample identification number on the International Air Transport Association container or plastic bag.

Place  the  tube  inside  a  second  bag  or  an  International  Air  Transport  Association container. Decontaminate the second bag. If using a plastic bag, remove the excess air, twist the neck of the second bag until it forms a tight coil, and seal it with a strip bag tie. Step  7.  Place  an  adhesive  label  containing  the  sample  identification  number  on  the  outer packaging. Step 8. Place the package inside the sample transfer case. Step 9. Complete the chain-of-custody document. Ensure that the operator handling the sample signs the initial signature block immediately. Note.  After  steps  3,  4,  and  6,  spray  and  wipe  the  package  with  a  0.5  percent  calcium hypochlorite solution. H-74. The documents that support the evacuated sample are integral components of the evacuation package and must accompany the sample. There is only one complete sample evacuation package for each sample. Each completed sample evacuation package is comprised of the—  Sealed and packaged sample container. Sealed document mailer.    Chain-of-custody  form  (the  completed  chain-of-custody  form  is  hand-carried  by  the  sample courier). SAMPLE EVACUATION EXECUTION H-75. In preparing for the execution of a sample evacuation, the commander prioritizes the samples that should be evacuated with the help of the command surgeon and CBRN officer and staff. The commander considers the following when determining the priority of samples:   What is the time sensitivity for a specific sample evacuation package?   Where  the  sample  was  collected  (the  proximity  of  transportation  or  courier  assets  for  sample transport)?   What is the role of the sample in the overall process of the operation (is it being used to support “detect to treat” or “verification of agent or release” decisions)?   How many resources (consumables) are needed to support analysis and testing? H-76. The personnel packaging, transporting, and storing samples must ensure the integrity of the sample from the time it is first taken until it is delivered to the supporting laboratory. The temperature at which the sample is stored and transported is crucial to its viability. Samples should be transported and stored at 1°C to 4°C. The sample courier should be able to periodically check the temperature within the sample transfer case to ensure continued sample viability. H-77. Designated samples are evacuated to laboratories for theater validation identification. Laboratories will prioritize sample analyses based on critical background information (for example, time sensitivity and role  of  the  sample).  The  laboratory  commander  will  determine  the  number  and  types  of  samples  to  be analyzed. H-78. Sample evacuation execution relies on an effective means to evacuate the sample. Specialized assets may  be  available;  however,  if  specialized  assets  are  not  available,  additional  courier  personnel  can  be trained to perform escort responsibilities. H-79. Sample  evacuation  packages  from  CBRN  elements  may  require  field  confirmatory  or  theater validation  identification  support.  The  applicable  Service  component  prepares  the  sample,  and  an  escort element  transports  the  sample.  The  supporting  medical  and/or  environmental  laboratory  destination  for theater  validation  testing  could  be  a  ship-based  laboratory,  U.S.  Air  Force  laboratory,  or  U.S.  Army medical laboratory. 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 H-55 Appendix H THEATER SAMPLE MANAGEMENT PROCESS H-80. The  geographic  combatant  commander  (GCC)  identifies  a  theater  sample  manager  to  manage  the movement of samples within theater and to definitive laboratories outside the theater based on feedback from the GCC command surgeon, CBRN staff, and supporting laboratories. The decision to return a sample to a CONUS definitive laboratory for further analysis is made by the field confirmatory/theater validation laboratory, GCC surgeon, theater commander, and/or CONUS higher commands. H-81. Before a CBRN sample is evacuated to a specific laboratory there are detailed requirements that must be met. As discussed in chapter 1, the need to evacuate samples to fulfill the commander’s information and PIRs will drive the sample management process. Proper identification of CBRN hazards affect decisions such as the administration of effective prophylaxis, troop movements, individual and collective protective postures, and selection of proper decontamination methods. These decisions are critical to the success of operations  in  a  CBRN  environment.  Issues  to  be  considered  prior  to  the  movement  of  CBRN  samples include the following:   Coordinate actions with the theater surgeon or medical officer.   Ensure that proper chain-of-custody procedures are being followed.  Prioritize the transport and analysis of samples. Provide  appropriately  trained  personnel  or  forces  to  escort  samples  to  the  transfer  point  or laboratory.    Coordinate with the appropriate command and staff transportation authorities to help so that the transport  and  transfer  of  a  sample  is  uninterrupted  across  international  borders  or  to  another government agency. The intent is unimpeded and controlled sample flow.   Evacuate background samples to a laboratory for analysis.   Maintain sample tracking and visibility. H-82. Figure H-5, page H-56, provides a snapshot of the sample identification process. CHAIN OF CUSTODY AND SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION H-83.  A  strict  chain  of  custody  needs  to  be  initiated  and  maintained  for  every  sample  collected.  When filled  out  properly,  the  chain  of  custody  provides  uninterrupted  chronological  documentation  of  the collection, custody, control, transfer, analysis, and disposition of a sample. It provides a documented record of information pertaining to a specific sample during transport from the point of collection, to the receiving medical  laboratory,  to  the  final  disposition  of  the  sample.  Individuals  receiving  a  sample  from  another individual  or  courier  must  sign  the  document  transferring  custody  of  the  sample  and  then  annotate  in writing what happened to the sample while in their custody. This includes the custody transfer that occurs whenever  supervision  of  the  sample  changes,  such  as  the  operator  changes  shifts.  The  document  will provide answers to the following questions about the sample:   When was it collected?   Who has maintained custody of it?   What has been done with it at each change of custody?   What was collected?   How much was collected?   How was it packaged?

A  complete  history  of  the  circumstances  surrounding  the  acquisition  of  each  sample  must  be documented and provided to the analyzing agency. These documents should also accompany shipments to the confirmatory laboratory. Critical information includes the—   Meteorological  conditions.

The purpose and proper use of these signs and markings provide warnings and instruction for U.S. and  allied  forces  as  they  navigate  a  potentially  contaminated  area.  Marking  of  a CBRN-contaminated  area  is  a  follow-on  task  that  is  performed  by  CBRN  R&S elements  to  indicate  contamination  before  direct  movement  by  military  personnel into  or  through  designated  areas.  This  appendix  provides  information  on  CBRN marking  procedures  and  signs  used  to  mark  areas  of  suspected  contamination. Marking will be according to MultiService Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Contamination Avoidance. MARKING PURPOSES I-1.  Marking a CBRN-contaminated area warns U.S. and allied forces of contamination threats/hazards, but the signs must be placed where they are most likely to be seen. Without visible markings, unprotected military personnel may enter into a contaminated area and become casualties. I-2.  CBRN reconnaissance is conducted to detect contamination:   Before forces must move into or through or occupy an area of unknown CBRN contamination.   When boundaries of a known contaminated area must be identified and marked.   When, at the time of survey, identification of a route or other key terrain as uncontaminated is required. I-3.  Once a CBRN R&S element surveys an area and CBRN contamination is located, the area is marked using  CBRN  marking  signs  and  a  CBRN  report  is  submitted  to  the  requesting  headquarters.  Marking  a contaminated area or equipment designates a hazard. A more detailed reconnaissance survey determines the extent and intensity of the contamination. Markings warn individuals and forces visually, identify routes through  or  around  contaminated  areas  to  maximize  operational  maneuverability,  and  identify  equipment that is hazardous to military personnel. I-4.  Marking of a contaminated area, bypasses, and surveyed uncontaminated key terrain is accomplished in two ways:   Hasty. Action taken as soon as possible, following the identification of contaminated terrain to mark the area with the intent of avoiding an unwarned encounter with the hazard.   Deliberate.  Actions  taken  to  improve  hasty  marking,  adding  additional  markers,  increasing visibility, and adding control measures when time and other resources permit. CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR MARKING SIGN DESCRIPTION I-5.  There  are  specific  standard  signs,  shapes,  and  inscriptions  used  for  CBRN  marking  signs. Standardizing these signs allows for rapid identification, understanding, and situational awareness across the force when these signs are encountered. I-6.  Signs used for marking contaminated areas are standard throughout NATO in color, shape, and size. A contamination marking set is available for use by U.S. and NATO forces. Examples are shown in figure I-1. 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 I-1 Appendix I • • •  •  White background with • • • Blue background with red lettering.

The primary and secondary colors of the CBRN marking signs are used to indicate the nature  of  the  contamination  hazard.  The  primary  color  refers  to  the  color  used  for  the background of the front surface of the marking sign. The secondary color refers to the color used for any markings and/or inscriptions (preferably on the front surface of the sign) In the case of danger  due  to  CBRN  contamination,  the  primary  color,  and  the  pattern  of  the  signs  by themselves will be the principal means of recognizing the type of contamination. As a safeguard, the words “ATOM” (for nuclear contamination), “BIO” (for biological contamination) or “GAS” (for chemical contamination), with the optional addition of a symbol where required by national authorities,  is  painted  or  written  with  the  secondary  color  on  the  front  surface.  The  language used for these inscriptions is selected by the forces erecting the sign. During joint operations, the language for inscriptions is English. The inscriptions are written parallel to the longer side of the sign. Shapes and sizes. CBRN signs should be—   The shape of the sign will be a right-angled isosceles triangle.   The base of the triangle will be approximately 28 centimeters (11 inches) and the opposite  sides will be approximately 20 centimeters (8 inches).   Triangles  will  be  made  of  metal,  wood,  plastic,  composition  board,  adhesive  material,  or any adequate material available.   Existing  stocks  of  colored  triangular  signs  of  slightly  divergent  shapes  and  sizes  will  be retained and used until stocks are exhausted. Note.  Infrared  and  visual  beacons  can  also  be  used  to  assist  in  marking  CBRN-contaminated areas. Beacons may be visible at night over a range of up to 1500 meters. Chemical lights can be attached to flag clips and placed between the beacons. INSCRIPTIONS I-7.  Additional  details  concerning  the  CBRN  contamination,  if  known,  are  to  be  inscribed  on  each marking  sign,  preferably  on  the  front  surface.  The  extra  details  inscribed  depend  on  the  kind  of  CBRN contamination. I-2 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 25 March 2013 Marking   Multiple  CBRN  contamination  may  exist  in  some  operational  areas.  In  this  case,  the contaminated  area  would be  marked  with  the  relevant  marking  signs, which  would  be  placed adjacent to each other.   Military  forces  follow  combatant  command  or  joint  operations  area  standards  for  marking CBRN  hazards.  When  those  standards  are  not  provided  or  when  standard  markers  are unavailable, military forces conducting reconnaissance operations may use expedient markers. MARKING PROCEDURES I-8.  Marking  contaminated  areas,  and  marking  lanes  through  and  around  them,  involves  attention  to detail and a carefully considered marking plan. MARKING CONTAMINATED AREAS I-9.  CBRN R&S elements should place contamination markers where the markers are most likely to be seen  by  approaching  military  personnel  and  friendly  forces.  CBRN  R&S  elements  that  locate contamination will place the markers creating a 200-meter buffer from contamination. Survey techniques shown in appendixes D and E are used to create this 200-meter buffer. Place adjacent  marking signs at intervals  of  10  to  100  meters,  depending  on  the  terrain,  to  prevent  military  forces  from  missing  posted markers and inadvertently entering contaminated areas. When marking a contaminated area in open terrain (that is, desert, plains, rolling hills), raise the markers to a desired height that permits approaching military forces to view the markers at distances up to 200 meters. I-10.  The following are CBRN marking sign inscriptions for persistent chemical agents, biological agents, and toxic industrial chemical (TIC) or toxic industrial biological (TIB)   Name/symbol  of  the  agent/chemical  used  (if  known),  TIC  if  an  unknown  toxic  industrial chemical is suspected, or TIB if contamination from an unknown toxic industrial biological is suspected.   Date-time group (DTG) of detection.   DTG of detonation/release (if known).   Concentration (if known). I-11.  The following are CBRN  marking sign inscriptions for radiological contamination including toxic industrial radiological (TIR):  Substance/emitter  (if  known)  (or  TIR  if  contamination  from  a  toxic  industrial  radiological  is suspected.    Dose rate and DTG of detection.   DTG of detonation/release (if known). I-12.  The CBRN signs should be placed at waist height, right-angled apex downward, with the front of the sign facing away from the contaminated area being marked and spaced at intervals of 10 to 100 meters depending on the terrain. Place the CBRN signs on fences, trees, rocks, poles, supplied marking sign poles, and other appropriate mounting mediums, or by putting the apex into the ground if a solid sign. This latter method should not be used if the other methods can be adopted, as the signs might be obscured by grass and other undergrowth and may be readily knocked down. Make sure the signs are clearly visible to the eye at a distance of approximately 50 meters in most conditions of visibility. If the signs are placed within a CBRN-contaminated  area,  the  signs  are  to  face  away  from  the  area  of  higher  dose  rate  or  higher concentration  if  such  can  be  determined.  The  marking  will  indicate  the  general  area  of  ground contamination but will take no account of downwind CBRN hazards. CBRN-contaminated areas may be of such  extent  that  complete  marking  of  the  whole  perimeter  will  be  impracticable.  Military  units  should therefore take into consideration that such areas might be marked only in the area of immediate concern.  I-13.  CBRN R&S elements normally mark contaminated areas on all sides to warn follow-on and support units  of  the  hazard.  Signs  are  normally  placed  to  create  a  200-meter  buffer  around  the  area  of  actual contamination. Additional marking at intersections of roads leading to CBRN hazards may be required to funnel or steer traffic away from the hazard area. Clear zones (safe lanes) may also be marked to provide 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 I-3 Appendix I greater  freedom  of  movement  by  forces agents/materials.  LANES AND BYPASS MARKING TERMS through  or  around  areas  contaminated  with  CBRN I-14.  When marking lanes and bypasses through contaminated areas, the terms below provide a common basis  for  discussing  marking  and  the  various  placements  of  signs.  Appropriate  CBRN  marking  signs (chemical, biological, or radiological) are used for each type of marker. Their placement and use in relation to  the  contamination  identify  them  as  a  certain  type  of  lane/bypass  marker  (entrance,  handrail,  exit, entrance funnel, final approach, or far recognition.  Entrance Markers I-15.  Entrance  markers  indicate  the  start  of  a  lane  through  a  contaminated  area.  They  signify  the uncontaminated-side boundary of the contaminated area and the point at which movement is restricted by the  lane  width  and  path.  Entrance  markers  also  indicate  the  lane  width.  Therefore,  it  is  critical  for  a maneuvering force to distinguish the entrance point clearly, since it signifies the point at which passing vehicles can no longer adjust their movement in reaction to the situation (direct and indirect fires) without jeopardizing the force. Entrance markers must be visually different from handrail markers to help a force distinguish this critical point in the lane. The distance between entrance markers must be the same as the width of the created lane. Entrance markers placed a minimum of 4.5 meters apart indicate a lane capable of supporting mounted movement, while markers placed a minimum of 1 meter apart indicate a dismounted lane. Handrail Markers I-16.  Handrail markers define the lane path through a contaminated area and indicate the limits of the lane width. As a minimum, mounted and dismounted lanes have a left handrail. Mounted and dismounted forces moving through a lane should keep the left handrail immediately to the left of their vehicle or person. The lane width is defined by the entrance markers. Therefore, when only the left handrail is marked, drivers use entrance and handrail markers to gauge the lane width and path. As the operation progresses, lane marking may be upgraded to include left and right handrails. Exit Markers I-17.  Exit markers indicate the farside limit of a lane through a contaminated area. For a passing force, the exit marker signifies the point at which movement is no longer confined to the lane path. Like entrance markers, exit markers must be distinguishably different from handrail markers; however, the exit may be marked the same as the entrance. Exit markers are placed to the left and right of an exit point and spaced the width of the reduced lane. This visual reference is critical when only a left handrail is  marked. The combination of entrance, left handrail, and exit markers gives the driver and the tank commander visual cues (entrance and exit points, lane width, and path) to pass safely along a lane. Entrance Funnel Markers I-18.  Entrance  funnel  markers  augment  entrance  marking.  The  V  formed  by  the  funnel  markers  forces approaching elements into a column formation and assists drivers and tank commanders in making last-minute adjustments before entering the lane. Final Approach Markers I-19.  Final approach markers are highly visible, more robust markers that augment the visual signature of entrance funnel markers. Units must be able to see the entrance funnel and/or the entrance funnel markers from the final approach marker. The final approach marker—   Provides  the  element  commander  with  a  highly  visible  reference  point  toward  which  to maneuver his formation. Signals element commanders to begin changing to a column formation. I-4 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 25 March 2013 Marking Far Recognition Markers I-20.  Far recognition markers are highly visible markers located between the final approach marker and the friendly element. They are primarily used when passing large-sized (for example, Army battalion-size) forces  through  a  lane  where  direct  observation  of  the  final  approach  marker  is  denied  due  to  distance, visibility,  or  terrain.  Far  recognition  markers  should  be  different  from  the  final  approach  marker.  Far recognition markers indicate the point at which forces begin changing their formation to posture for the passage. A single far recognition marker may serve up to two lanes when located 200 to 400 meters apart. Once lanes are upgraded to two-way traffic, far recognition markers are required for each two-way lane. Far  recognition  markers  should  be  visually  alterable  so  that  they  can  be  distinguished  from  the  far recognition  marker  of  an adjacent  lane.  This  assists  the  mission  command/C2  of  large  formations  when passing on several adjacent lanes. When a far recognition marker serves more than one lane, a guide or a traffic control point/post is collocated with the far recognition marker nearest the obstacle. LEVELS OF LANE MARKING AND PATTERNS I-21.  There  are  two  levels  of  lane  marking  for  CBRN  hazards—initial  and  intermediate.  Each  lane-marking level provides an increase in lane signature and capability. Lane requirements change over time as operations mature from the passage of the assault force to the passage of larger follow-on forces. Initial lane-marking requirements are driven by the nature of the fight through the CBRN hazard area. Initially, marking must be rapid, providing only the bare minimum signature needed to safely pass initial small units (company teams, platoons). This contrasts with lane requirements during later phases of an operation where larger units (battalion and above) require improvements to existing initial hasty marked lanes. Two-way traffic  becomes  a  priority  for  the  simultaneous  forward  passage  of  combat  units  and  return  traffic (ambulances, empty supply vehicles) necessary to sustain the force. With the increase in traffic, volume comes more diverse forces and levels of driver experience. Lane-marking limits must be clear to the most inexperienced driver or crewmember; do not assume he has knowledge of the unit SOP. I-22.  Commanders must be aware of how the lane needs of a force change with the operation so that they can anticipate lane marking and lane capability requirements. Integrating the levels of lane marking into the overall CBRN defense and avoidance plan ensures that a unit’s needs are satisfied. The forces necessary to mark and upgrade lanes must be allocated and tasked with that mission. The scheme of maneuver and the service support plan are the basis for analyzing lane requirements. The following paragraphs describe lane- marking patterns in detail and provide guidelines on when a commander should upgrade lane marking and lane capability. Initial Lane Marking I-23.  The  CBRN  R&S  element  emplaces  the  initial  lane-marking  pattern  (see  figure  I-2,  page  I-6) immediately after the lane across the CBRN hazard is determined. This is a signal to the supported unit commander that the lane is ready for traffic. Initial lane marking is kept to a minimum, focusing on the markings  needed  to  pass  immediate  forces  (company  teams  and  smaller)  through  the  lane  to  secure  the point of penetration on the farside if needed. Normally, a security force observes the lane as it is being marked and does not need the greater visual signature of mature lane marking. The initial lane-marking pattern contains—   Entrance markers.   Left handrail markers.   Exit markers.   Entrance funnel markers.   A final approach marker. 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 I-5 Appendix I  Note. The distance between markers is driven by mission variables. Distances shown are a recommendation.Legend: * m distance for dismounted lanes meterFigure I-2. Initial lane marking Intermediate Lane Marking I-24.  Upgrading initial lane marking to intermediate lane marking is triggered by one of two key events:   Commitment of larger combat forces that are unable to directly observe the CBRN-hazard area as it was marked.   Rearward passage of sustainment traffic (casualty evacuation and vehicle recovery). I-25.  Intermediate lane marking has two goals:   Increasing the lane signature to assist in the passage of larger combat forces. Providing sufficient marking for two-way, single-lane traffic. I-26.  Intermediate  lane  marking  builds  on  the  initial  lane-marking  pattern  by  adding  right  handrail markers,  exit  funnel  markers,  far  recognition  markers,  and  a  farside  final  approach  marker.  Figure  I-3 shows the intermediate lane-marking pattern. I-6 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 25 March 2013 Marking  Note.  The  distance  between  markers  is  driven  by  mission variables. Distances shown are a recommendation.Legend: * m distance for dismounted lanes meterFigure I-3. Intermediate lane marking BYPASS MARKING I-27.  Bypasses are marked using the same lane-marking patterns, marking signs, and visual cues as a lane. However,  marking  a  bypass  around  a  CBRN  hazard  is  much  different  from  marking  a  lane  through  a CBRN hazard because the amount of room available for forces to maneuver must be determined. While lanes through a CBRN hazard are normally expanded to the left, bypasses are expanded away from  the CBRN hazard. I-28.  Bypasses must show where it is safe to rapidly pass around a CBRN hazard, without unnecessarily restricting the force’s ability to maneuver. To accomplish this, the marking unit will mark the bypass with a bypass-marking pattern (modified initial lane-marking pattern with right handrail markers added). The unit will perform reconnaissance and initially mark the bypass 500 meters wide to allow platoons to maneuver around  the  CBRN  hazard.  The  width  of  the  bypass  is  increased  as  time  allows  further  reconnaissance. Limited visibility or additional CBRN hazards discovered at the flank of the CBRN hazard that is being bypassed may constrain the marked width of the path to less than 500 meters. (The right handrail markers must  be  visible  from  the  left  handrail  markers.)  In  addition  to  bypass  marking,  units  should  consider establishing  mobile  guards on  the friendly  side  of the  CBRN  hazard  to  prevent vehicles/personnel from entering it. Figure I-4, page I-8, provides an illustration of bypass marking. 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 I-7 Appendix I  Note. The distance between markers is driven by mission variables. Distances shown are a recommendation.Legend: * m distance for dismounted lanes meter Figure I-4. Bypass marking ENHANCED MARKING I-29.  In times of reduced visibility (for example, darkness, fog, rain) enhanced visual marking can be used. Enhanced  visual  marking  occurs  by  attaching  sources  of  light  where  the  actual  marker  is  placed.  The additional lights are attached using various means such as clips, wire, ties, and string. This includes—  Infrared markers (nonvisible spectrum). Infrared markers cannot be seen unless using night-vision devices with infrared capability. They are attached to actual contamination markers. They can be used when friendly forces are equipped with night-vision devices that can see infrared. Marking with infrared markers may occur when a military advantage would be obtained, such as when an adversary does not have night vision infrared capability.    Visual  spectrum  lights.  These  lights  can  include  chemical  lights  or  battery  operated  lights placed along with the actual contamination markers. They ensure markers can be seen in reduced visibility using the naked eye. I-30.  Another form of marking can occur by transmitting marker placement on shared digital formats for others  to  see  on  their  various  virtual  maps.  Examples  of  these  include  the  use  of  overlay  systems  and various Service mission command/C2 suites.  URBAN AREA MARKING CONSIDERATIONS I-31.  When  marking  CBRN  hazards  in  urban  areas,  additional  steps  should  be  considered.  METT-TC/METT-T will drive how CBRN hazards are marked. Additional marking considerations are:   Additional marking requirements may be required by the host country.   Entryways  of  suspect  buildings  and  other  facilities  that  may  be  contaminated  with  CBRN agents/materials must be marked at critical points, for example, doorways and windows. I-8 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 25 March 2013 Marking   Additional marking at intersections of roads leading to CBRN hazards may be required to funnel or steer traffic away from the hazard area. MARKING CONTAMINATED EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES I-32.  Material  contaminated  by  chemical,  biological,  and radiological  agents must  be  marked  to  protect military  personnel  from  accidentally  coming  into  contact  with  the  contamination.  Place  contamination markers  on  unmarked  equipment  present  in  the  CBRN  attack  area.  Military  personnel  using  equipment after  it  has  been  through  decontamination  must  take  precautions  against  vapor,  particulate,  and  liquid contamination that may be trapped inside filters, assemblies, and joints. The CBRN contamination could pose a hazard while equipment is being used or maintained. Figure I-5 is a sample of a hazard warning tag. Figure I-5. Sample CBRN hazard warning tag  I-33.  CBRN signs may be placed centrally on at least two adjacent sides of a complete equipment or unit load  pallet,  right-angled  apex  downward.  The  signs  must  be  clearly  visible  from  all  likely  avenues  of approach. Irregularly shaped items, and nonpalletized stores, will be marked in the obvious and convenient places. RADIOLOGICAL MARKING PROCEDURES I-34.  Marking of a radiologically contaminated area merely indicates the presence of a radiological hazard, the extent of which must be determined by qualified Service members using instrument readings, surveys, or information from other forces. Note. In case of limited space on the front surface of the sign, as a minimum, the name/symbol of the agent (if known) and/or the dose rate/concentration (if known) is to be written on the front surface. Any other details may be written on the back surface. I-35.  A radiologically contaminated area may not be marked when a military advantage would be obtained by not doing so. This decision would be made at the discretion of the commander. In such cases, positive measures will be taken to warn other allied forces of the existence of the radiologically contaminated area. I-36.  Following a nuclear incident, radiological signs are to be placed on all probable routes leading into radiologically  contaminated  areas.  When  the  dose  rate  is  above  1  centigray  per  hour,  radiological contamination signs showing the actual dose rate are to be placed on all probable route boundaries leading into  the  contaminated  area.  Lower  radiation  contamination  levels  normally  are  not  marked  even  though long  stays  in  areas  of  old  contamination  might  produce  significant  doses.  Military  forces  planning prolonged  stays  in  an  area  during  a  nuclear  attack  should  check  the  area  with  RADIAC  instruments regardless of whether it is marked. I-37.  In the case of toxic industrial radiologicals, radiological signs are to be placed on all probable routes leading into contaminated areas. When the dose rate is above 2 micrograys per hour, signs showing the actual dose rate are to be placed. Also, move or correct the radiological sign periodically as radioactivity decays over a period of time. I-38.  Forces  leaving  a  contaminated  area  or  otherwise  relinquishing  responsibility  for  an  area  leave perimeter marking signs in place. The command taking over responsibility for the area will continue the periodic  correction  or  movement  of  the  signs  or  remove  them  when  they  are  no  longer  a  hazard  to personnel or forces. 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 I-9 Appendix I I-39.

Nontraditional CBRN reports (such as medical reports) outlined in this appendix support the execution of CBRN assessment by non-CBRN forces  (such  as  PVNTMED  assets),  and  exploitation  and  WMD  elimination operations  by  specialized  CBRN  teams.  The  timely  and  accurate  collection, evaluation, and exchange of CBRN information are vital in avoiding and mitigating CBRN  threats/hazards  in  the  operational  environment,  and  to  address  exposure documentation and medical surveillance determinations. Reports pertaining to CBRN information support the process of predicting, detecting, identifying, warning of, and reporting  CBRN  attacks.  These  reports  inform  forces  of  potential  CBRN  hazards within the operational environment. The reports that result from the information and data collection will also serve as the future record for the incident that may be used in various  assessments,  including  determination  for  long-  term  medical  and  health surveillance.  Commanders  at  all  levels  require  timely,  accurate,  and  evaluated information that results from locating and assessing CBRN threats and hazards in the operational  environment.  Locating  CBRN  threats  and  hazards  (such  as  clandestine CBRN  laboratories  and  other  hazardous  materials,  explosives,  and  munitions)  by forward maneuver units can affect operations and planned R&S activities. Incidents involving CBRN agents or materials on land, in air, or at sea can have a significant effect  on  military  operations,  plans,  and  decisions. The  CBRNWRS  is  the  primary means  of  warning  forces  and  reporting  an  actual  or  predicted  CBRN  hazard.  The CBRNWRS allows commanders and CBRN staffs to determine required protective measures and plan operations accordingly. Commanders have the responsibility at all levels  so  that  plans,  directives,  and  SOPs  consider  CBRN  defense  a  priority.  The CBRNWRS  must  be  coordinated  with  the  medical  surveillance  and  information systems and the personnel/casualty systems so that data captured from a CBRN event related to personnel exposure can be saved and archived for future use. CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR WARNING AND REPORTING SYSTEM J-1.  The  CBRNWRS  is  most  effective  when  visualized  and  implemented  as  a  collective  system  of premission, mission execution, and postmission reports and messages. Ensuring that sufficient information is  available  prior  to  execution  of  R&S  missions  supports  the  rapid  and  effective  execution  of  tactical missions  while  reducing  the  impact  of  uncertainty.  During  the  execution  of  R&S  operations,  valuable information is collected to better assess the overall CBRN threat or hazard to the force and the execution of exploitation or WMD elimination operations. Table J-1, page I-2, represents reports and/or messages that support premission planning, mission execution, and postmission activities. 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29.AFTTP 3-2.44 J-1 Appendix J  Table J-1.

During R&S activities, the CBRNWRS is an information management function that entails collecting and analyzing data from assessments within the operational area to support tactical operations. It provides quality  information  to  the  right  person  at  the  right  time  in  a  usable  form  to  simplify  understanding  and decisionmaking,  which  allows  commanders  and  CBRN  staffs  to  determine  requirements  on  protective measures and plan CBRN operations. Note.  The  North  Atlantic  Treaty  Organization  (NATO)  conducts  CBRNWRS  activities according  to  STANAG  2103/Allied  Tactical  Publication  (ATP)-45D,  and  U.S.  forces  have implemented this agreement in Multi-Service Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Contamination Avoidance. J-3.  CBRNWRS  capabilities  include  manual  and  automated  processes  in  the  creation,  collection  and control,  dissemination,  and  storage  and  retrieval  of  information  obtained  from  affected  forces,  coalition partners, and appropriate nongovernmental organizations and indigenous agencies. Capabilities may range from detectors and alarms that are not integrated to fully integrated sensors at selected locations—allowing J-2 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 25 March 2013 Reports the commander and CBRN staffs to anticipate future conditions and accurately assess risks. The vertical and  horizontal  exchange  of  CBRN-related  information  relayed  through  the  CBRNWRS  keeps  different commands,  agencies,  coalition  partners,  and  functional/staff  personnel  informed.  The  CBRN  staff determines  the  need  for  specific  types  of  CBRN  information  (for  example,  when  and  where  the  CBRN attack occurred). CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR INFORMATION MANAGEMENT J-4.  CBRN information management focuses on obtaining relevant data about the operational area, which can  be  processed  by  the  CBRN  staff  into  operationally  significant  information.  To  be  useful,  CBRN information must be collected, reported, and evaluated. Once the CBRN information is evaluated, it can be used to update intelligence, plan force protection and avoidance measures, initiate exploitation operations, or  conduct  WMD  elimination  planning.  The  volume  of  information  collected  and  reported  could  easily disrupt  communications  and  tactical  operations  if  not  properly  managed.  See  MultiService  Tactics, Techniques,  and  Procedures  for  Chemical,  Biological,  Radiological,  and  Nuclear  Contamination Avoidance for additional information on information management. TYPES OF CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR REPORTS J-5.  The CBRNWRS consists of six standard reports for reporting CBRN incidents or attacks, or locating and reporting CBRN hazards within the operational environment. (See Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and  Procedures  for  Chemical,  Biological,  Radiological,  and  Nuclear  Aspects  of  Contamination Avoidance.) Note. The following is unique to the U.S. Army: In addition to the standard CBRN reports, other reports may be used to provide additional details regarding a CBRN attack or locating CBRN weapons or materials. These reports are specialized CBRN reports. Specialized CBRN reports are used by units to provide situational awareness to the supported command and staff during execution of operations or in support of CBRN exploitation and WMD elimination operations. (See Army Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures [ATTP] 3-90.15.) OTHER TACTICAL REPORTS J-6.  Other  tactical  reports  include  unexploded  explosive  ordnance  (UXO),  spot,  and  size,  activity, location, unit, time, and equipment (SALUTE) reports and system-specific reports. Any force may provide a spot or SALUTE report that includes information on contamination, locating CBRN ordnance, hazardous material,  or  other  suspicious  activities  (for  example,  clandestine  laboratory).  Sensor  suites  provide system-specific reports containing component- and system-level detection and identification results.  MEDICAL CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR REPORTS J-7.  CBRN incident medical reports are to be prepared for incidents and provided to medical channels in a timely and adequate manner. The documentation and archiving of actual or potential CBRN exposures is essential  (and  required)  to  address  future  investigation  and/or  health  surveillance  of  potentially  exposed personnel. J-8.  The medical “incident report” actually consists of two ‘forms’ or sets of reported information. The first is referred to as the Initial Field Account Survey (IFAS). In some documents, the IFAS has been called the Basic Exposure Evaluation Form (BEEF). The IFAS is a documentation of the onsite field information regarding the CBRN hazard, detection results, exposures, symptoms, visual and witness information, and other details. This form is especially critical and will typically need to be completed by units involved in an attack, and CBRN units or personnel involved in collection of CBRN samples and reporting. There may be 25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 J-3 Appendix J  multiple units completing separate IFASs. The second form is referred to as the Incident Report Survey (IRS). The IRS has been referred to as the Health Incident Technical Summary report in other documents). This  form  is  a  postincident  health  assessment  typically  prepared  by  HSS/FHP/PVNTMED  assets. PVNTMED assets cannot complete the IRS without adequate information from the IFAS (also known as BEEF). It is therefore essential that CBRN personnel ensure that such forms are completed and provided to appropriate medical/PVNTMED assets. J-9.  The IFAS and IRS forms (figure J-1, page J-7) are available as electronic data fields in the official DOD environmental data archive known as the Defense Occupational and Environmental Health Readiness System the DOEHRS module will allow for real-time data archiving; however, typically only PVNTMED assets will have access to this system; therefore, sample hardcopy versions are included as figure J-1, page J-7. For the most current versions of these forms, access and download from the DOEHRS website. If completed as hardcopy, then these forms must be submitted to the Occupational and Environmental Health Surveillance Data Portal via e-mail using the following addresses: (DOEHRS):  <https://mesl.apgea.arrmy.mil/mesl/doehrsResources/initialize.do>.  Use  of   Unclassified data: <oehs.data@us.army.mil>.   Classified data: <oehs@usachppm.army.smil.mil>. INITIAL FIELD ACCOUNT SURVEY J-10.  The  IFAS  ensures  that  CBRN  incident  details  and  a  roster  of  exposed  and  medically  treated personnel  are  adequately  captured.  This  is  critical  for  future  use  in  medical  surveillance  considerations. FHP/PVNTMED personnel will use information on the IFAS, along with other pertinent documents, when documenting a health risk assessment summary of the incident. J-11.  The  determination  that  an  occupational  and  environmental  health  (OEH)  exposure  is  significant enough to report it as an incident is somewhat subjective, but there are certain criteria that indicate a report should be prepared. The most obvious scenarios are those events that result in real-time health impacts that require medical countermeasures or treatment. However, even events where there is no notable impact to human health or mission should be documented if something triggers a specific evaluation or investigation of the potential presence of a CBRN/OEH hazard. For these types of incidents, documentation of negative findings can be important to address future medical queries. It is essential that Service members understand that it is to their own benefit to help so that potential exposure incidents are adequately documented if they have future health concerns or claims that may be attributed to such exposures. J-12.   The  IFAS  should  be  completed  by  FHP  personnel  and  the  chain  of  command  involved  in  the incident. Figure J-1, page J-7, provides a list of considerations that can be used to determine if an OEH incident warrants a significant activity (SIGACT) report and additional exposure documentation. Details in the IFAS and the underlying reports such as SIGACTs and roster may be classified. Unit security personnel must review the IFAS and determine the classification it should have. Since standard SIGACTs typically do  not  include  all  the  required  information  for  CBRN/OEH  exposure  incidents,  a  form  called  IFAS  is provided in this appendix as a template to expand the information that may have been put in the SIGACT. If a SIGACT already contains all the required information, then a separate IFAS is not required; otherwise, the IFAS should be completed and should just reference the SIGACT number. By completing the IFAS, PVNTMED  specialists  can  properly  investigate  the  exposure  and  work  with  medical  personnel  so  that appropriate  medical  follow-up  and  health  surveillance  is  conducted.  In  addition,  the  information  can provide  valuable  lessons  learned  that  could  help  mitigate  future  health  impacts  from  similar  events. Complete the form as thoroughly as possible and submit to the command surgeon/FHP officer within 24 hours of an incident. The following are indicators that and IFAS should be completed:   The presence of an occupational and environmental health (OEH) hazard is plausibly associated with  actual  observed  (acute)  clinical  health  outcomes  that  are  reported  and/or  treated  (for example, complaints of headaches, dizziness, skin/eye irritation/burning, coughing, nausea, and other abnormal signs).   The  presence  of  an  acute  OEH  hazard  is  indicated  through  positive  detection  using  real-time field  equipment.  For  example,  M8/M256/improved  chemical  agent  monitor  detectors  for chemical warfare agents, and radiation detection, indication and computation (RADIAC) meters for radioactive materials. J-4 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 25 March 2013 Reports   Evaluation of data or related information by an appropriate medical professional indicates that exposure to the OEH hazard could plausibly result in some significant (moderate or higher risk level) clinically relevant adverse health outcome (significant long-term chronic effects).   Visual/sensory  cues  indicating  potential  presence of  an OEH hazard  (obscurants/cloud,  odors, strange liquid/powders) are present. INCIDENT REPORT SURVEY FORM J-13.   The IRS report is a consolidated assessment of overall incident information pertaining to personnel exposures and any associated health effects. Completion of the IRS ensures that the necessary information is consolidated and submitted to the designated DOD data archive. Ideally, this information is prepared in as  an  unclassified  document  so  that  personnel  and  providers  can  have  access.  A  PVNTMED  unit designated  by  the  command  surgeon/FHP  officer  will  prepare  the  IRS.  While  details  in  some  of  the underlying documents and reports (SIGACTs, IFAS, and roster) may be classified, to the extent possible the IRS report itself should be completed at the lowest classification possible for the widest distribution. The  IRS  form  consists  of  six  basic  sections.  Most  sections  are  straightforward  but  some  additional information is described below: referred   Most  of  the  required  elements  listed  on  the  IRS  report  form  should  be  contained  in  other documents.  Information  such  as  SIGACT,  IFAS,  rosters,  field  and/or  analytical  data,  risk communication  documents,  may  be some assessment/interpretation of the information is necessary to provide an overall summary of the required  information.  For  example,  the  PVNTMED  personnel  should  summarize  the  incident information  and  provide  a  qualitative  risk  estimate  of  the  level  of  the  acute  health  effects presented during the incident, and, a risk estimate of the potential for long term chronic health consequences of concern (see USAPHC [Provisional]) TG 230 for information regarding OEH risk  estimation).  Depending  on  the  incident,  risk  communication  products  (for  example,  fact sheets and briefings) may be prepared.   Health effects and medical information. to  as  attachments.  However,  Include  reference  to  the  roster  that  indicates  those  persons  medically  treated  and  their disposition.  Provide  any  rapid  medical  evaluation  (RME)  reports  and  any  Standard  Form (SF) 600 (Chronological Record of Medical Care) overlays.   Describe overall types and severity of acute and chronic health effects and the ‘risk levels’ ranking  assigned  for  each.  If  none  are  identified,  state  “none  identified/anticipated.”  If health effects/risk is only to unique personnel/units, explain. J-14.  The following are short-term risk levels, health effects, and medical treatment that may occur during the mission:   Extremely  high.  Loss  of  ability  to  accomplish  the  mission  if  hazards  occur  during  mission. Notable  in-theater  medical  countermeasures/resources  were  required  (protection,  treatment, exposure documentation).   High. Significant degradation of mission capabilities in terms of the required mission standard, inability to accomplish all parts of the mission, or inability to complete the mission to standard if hazards  occur  during  the  mission.  Some  in-theater  medical  countermeasures/resources  (for example, protection, treatment, and exposure documentation) were required.   Low.  Expected  losses  have  little  or  no  impact  on  accomplishing  the  mission.  No  in-theater medical  resources  required/anticipated  other  than  documentation  for  health  incident  technical summary. Note. Personnel may be grouped into different exposure categories (reflecting different exposure levels/durations/estimated  severity  of  exposure).  These  different  groups  may  then  each  be designated with different risk levels.  25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 J-5 Appendix J  J-15.  The  following  are  long-term  risk  levels,  chronic  effects,  and  medical  surveillance  that  may  occur postdeployment:   Extremely  high.  Significant  future  medical  surveillance  activities  and  medical  provider resources  anticipated.  Document  IRS  and  exposure  data  in  designated  DOD  archive  and designate a registry to actively track the identified personnel/group and conduct specific active surveillance and/or medical follow-up procedures for life cycle of identified group.    High. Notable future medical surveillance activities and related resources anticipated. Document identified  exposed IRS  and  exposure  data personnel/group documented; possible passive medical surveillance activities for this group. in  designated  DOD  archive;  specifically   Moderate.  Limited  future  medical  surveillance  activities  and  related  resources  anticipated. in  designated  DOD  archive;  document  potential Document  IRS  and  exposure  data groups/personnel of interest.    Low. No specific medical action required. Document IRS and exposure data in designated DOD archive. Note. Personnel may be grouped into different exposure categories (reflecting different exposure levels/durations/estimated  severity  of  exposure).  These  different  groups  may  then  each  be designated  with  different  risk  levels.  It  is  recommended  that  long-term  risk  estimates  be coordinated with a Service health surveillance center physician. J-16.

warning order weapons of mass destruction SECTION II – TERMS *chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear sample management Chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) sample management is the process whereby CBRN samples are collected, packaged, transported, stored, transferred, analyzed, tracked, and disposed. It begins with the decision to collect CBRN samples and continues to the reporting of information produced by the final analysis of that sample. This process includes safeguarding and prioritizing CBRN samples, tracking their movements and analytical status, and reporting the end result of sample analysis. The CBRN sample management process establishes procedures, guidelines, and constraints at staff and unit levels to protect and preserve the integrity of CBRN samples that may have tactical, operational, and/or strategic implications. *definitive identification The employment of multiple state-of-the-art, independent, established protocols and technologies by scientific experts in a nationally recognized laboratory to determine the unambiguous identity of a Glossary-4 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 25 March 2013 Glossary chemical, biological, radiological, and/or nuclear hazard with the highest level of confidence and degree of certainty necessary to support strategic-level decisions. *field confirmatory identification The employment of technologies with increased specificity and sensitivity by technical forces in a field environment to identify chemical, biological, radiological, and/or nuclear hazards with a moderate level of confidence and the degree of certainty necessary to support follow-on tactical decisions. *presumptive identification The employment of technologies with limited specificity and sensitivity by general-purpose forces in a field environment to determine the presence of a chemical, biological, radiological, and/or nuclear hazard with a low level of confidence and the degree of certainty necessary to support immediate tactical decisions. *theater validation identification The employment of multiple independent, established protocols and technologies by scientific experts in the controlled environment of a fixed or mobile/transportable laboratory to characterize a chemical, biological, radiological, and/or nuclear hazard with a high level of confidence and the degree of certainty necessary to support operational-level decisions.  25 March 2013 ATP 3-11.37/MCWP 3-37.4/NTTP 3-11.29/AFTTP 3-2.44 Glossary-5 This page intentionally left blank.    References  SOURCES USED These are the sources quoted or paraphrased in this publication.
