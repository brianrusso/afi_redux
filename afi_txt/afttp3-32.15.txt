Overview. Current contingency airfield operations will most likely require a mobile arresting gear system  setback installation during airfield recovery. In these instances, the MRES will be installed in combination with the MAAS.  1.1.1. Although not designed to be expeditious, a setback installation must still meet  stringent  recovery  timelines.  This  necessitates  specific  pre-attack  actions and  potential  sequence  changes  to  normal  installation  procedures  to  avoid conflicts with other rapid airfield damage repair teams and their large amounts of  equipment  and  vehicles  throughout  the  minimum  airfield  operating  surface (MAOS). 1.1.2. This publication describes actions to perform a rapid mobile arresting gear system  setback  installation  after  an  attack.  Specifically,  it  describes  required resources,  pre-attack  actions,  planning  factors,  and  rapid  setback  installation procedures not included in the T.O. Note:  Expeditionary  installations  may  not  remain  in  service  longer  than  one year without a waiver; request waivers as described in AFI 32-1043, Managing, Operating, and Maintaining Aircraft Arresting Systems. 1.2.  Description.  The  mobile  arresting  gear  system  consists  of  the  Mobile Aircraft  Arresting  System  (MAAS)  and  the  Mobile  Runway  Edge  Sheave (MRES).  Contingency  airfields  support  multiple  airframes,  in  most  instances, and  consequently  require  additional  wing  clearance  for  wide-bodied  aircraft. The MRES allows the MAAS to be setback from the minimum operating strip’s (MOS) edge to provide this wing clearance, in addition to placing the absorbers outside the frangibility zone to prevent repositioning later. A setback installation may  take  additional  two  and  one-half  plus  hours  compared  to  a  MAAS-only installation. When a contingency airfield supports fighter aircraft only, or when a  Wing  Commander  determines  a  setback  installation  will  cause  unacceptable delays to initial sorties, the MAAS may be installed temporarily at the edge of the MOS without a runway edge sheave system. Once normal operations return it must be relocated outside the frangibility zone. 1.2.1. Lightweight Fairlead Beams (LWFB) may still be in some postured unit type  codes  (UTCs),  but  will  be  replaced  with  the  MRES  through  attrition. Therefore, only the MRES will be discussed in this publication hereafter.   AFTTP 3-32.15   21 JUNE 2016                                                                            5  1.2.2.  The  MAAS  is  a  rotary  friction-type  energy  absorber  consisting  of  two identical units installed on each side of the runway (Figure 1.1). It is designed around special nylon tape used as the purchase or drive member. Arrestment of landing aircraft is accomplished by engagement of the aircraft's arresting hook with  a  hook  cable  assembly  stretched  across  the  runway.  The  hook  cable  is fastened  to  the  nylon  tape  with  a  mechanical  connection  known  as  the  tape connector. Energy of the arrested aircraft is absorbed in the rotary friction brakes during  the  tape  payout.  The  MAAS  is  capable  of  arresting  specified  aircraft within a nominal 1,200 feet runout. The system is capable of being installed in soil,  asphalt,  or  concrete,  but  is  most  likely  installed  in  soil  for  setback installations.  The  MAAS  is  towable  by  any  vehicle  capable  of  towing  18,000 pounds and equipped with a standard pintle-hook. Figure 1.1. MAAS Trailer Views.  1.2.3. The MRES system (Figure 1.2) is designed to enhance capabilities of the MAAS by providing a low profile runway edge sheave allowing the MAAS to be setback from the runway, removing high profile equipment from edges of the runway. One mobile runway edge sheave trailer is called an MRES assembly. Two  mobile  runway  edge  sheave  assemblies  make  up  a  mobile  runway  edge sheave system, or MRES system. Any installation combining the MRES system and the MAAS is referred to as a mobile arresting gear system.     6                           AFTTP 3-32.15  21 JUNE 2016 Figure 1.2. MRES Assembly Views.  1.2.3.1.  The  MRES  is  designed  for  contingency  situations  and  installed  in  a bidirectional  and  setback  configuration.  It  should  not  be  used  as  a  permanent component of a real-property installed mobile arresting gear system. As with the LWFB and standard fairlead beam, it reduces potential hazards to incoming and outgoing  aircraft  by  significantly  reducing  the  arresting  system  profile  at  the edge of the MOS. The MRES is the preferred contingency runway edge sheave as it has a cleaner and safer installation footprint and does not require additional vehicles  for  transporting,  unloading,  and  installing  the  system.  After  airfield recovery, and when time permits, increase the rollover ramp on the sides of the MRES to a 1V:30H slope in accordance with FC 3-260-18F, Air Force Aircraft Arresting Systems (AAS) Installation, Operation, and Maintenance (IO&M), to allow an aircraft to roll over them smoothly. 1.2.3.2. The system may be anchored in soil or on concrete and is suitable for all arrestments and aborted take-offs. The MRES is towable by any vehicle capable of towing 5,200 pounds and equipped with a standard pintle-hook. The MRES assembly may be attached to the rear of a MAAS trailer for tandem towing with a  suitable  vehicle  capable  of  towing  23,200  pounds  and  equipped  with  a standard pintle-hook.  AFTTP 3-32.15   21 JUNE 2016                                                                            7  1.3. Safety Summary. Training, practice, and safety are essential to minimize installation time. The following paragraphs describe general safety precautions that personnel should understand and apply during all phases of operation and maintenance. 1.3.1. Winch Operation. 1.3.1.1. When loading onto an aircraft or other transport vehicle using the on-board  MAAS  winch,  do  not  winch  the  trailer  up  an  incline  exceeding  15 degrees. 1.3.1.2. Do not overlap winch cable during rewind. Overlap may result in cable failure, injury to personnel, or damage to equipment. 1.3.2.  Towing.  The  following  steps  are  required  to  ensure  the  safety  of  the equipment and personnel prior to towing the MAAS. 1.3.2.1. Physically inspect the trailer for any loose hardware or equipment. 1.3.2.2. Check the hook cable to ensure that it is properly stored on its storage reel and the free end of the cable is properly secured. 1.3.2.3. Check the tape connector for proper storage and security. 1.3.2.4.  Inspect  the  front  and  rear  sheave  guards  to  ensure  they  are  properly installed and their fasteners are tight. 1.3.2.5. Inspect the hydraulic power units and storage brackets to ensure they are properly secured. 1.3.2.6.  Inspect  all  installation  hardware  and  storage  brackets  for  security  and tightness of straps. 1.3.2.7. Inspect splash guards for damage and ensure that they are secure. 1.3.2.8. Check front storage box to ensure lid is properly installed and latches are secure. 1.3.2.9. Ensure the retaining bolts and pins are properly installed and secure in the front and rear axle support frames. 1.3.2.10. If the trailer is being towed with its protective cover installed, check for security of lanyard and hooks.   8                           AFTTP 3-32.15  21 JUNE 2016 1.3.2.11.  To  prevent  serious  injury  to  personnel,  ensure  the  MAAS  winch operator protective shield is properly installed during winching operation. 1.3.2.12. Anytime the MAAS or MRES is being connected or disconnected from the  “Prime  Mover”  (tow  vehicle)  chock  one  wheel  and  set  the  parking handbrake. This also applies when the trailer is not being transported or is not connected to its tow vehicle. Failure to comply may result in serious injury to personnel and/or equipment. 1.3.2.13. Always use a signalman to direct the driver of the tow vehicle. Failure to comply may result in injury to personnel or equipment. 1.3.2.14. Towing speed limit is reduced when towing two trailers in tandem to 20  mph  over  improved  roads.  Failure  to  comply  may  result  in  injury  to personnel or equipment. 1.3.3. Raising/Lowering. 1.3.3.1. Hydraulic systems will be operated by qualified personnel only. 1.3.3.2. Prior to operating the MAAS  hydraulic raise/lower system, chock one rear wheel and apply the parking brake. Failure to comply may result in serious injury  to  personnel  and  equipment.  A  runaway  vehicle  may  be  the  result  of noncompliance. 1.3.3.3. Ensure the area under the trailer is clear and instruct personnel to remain clear of the trailer during the raise or lower operation. 1.3.3.4. Keep feet and hands away from axle frames and trailer bottom during raising or lowering trailer to prevent injury to personnel. 1.3.3.5.  If  the  axle  support  frames  hit  any  object  in  its  path  when  raising  the MAAS trailer, stop until the object is removed to prevent injury to personnel or equipment. 1.3.3.6. When raising/lowering trailer, ensure front tool box lid is either properly latched/secured or completely removed. Failure to comply may result in the lid binding  into  the  hydraulic  elbow  on  front  axle  cylinder  actuator  and  broken elbow, which eliminates the ability to raise/lower trailer. 1.3.4. Installation. 1.3.4.1.  Wear  adequate  eye  protection  while  driving  stakes.  Propelled  rocks, metal fragments, and soil particles can damage unprotected eyes.  AFTTP 3-32.15   21 JUNE 2016                                                                            9  1.3.4.2. Do not position hands near the stake driving head/stake interface when driving  stakes.  The  stake  driving  head  occasionally  bounces  off  the  stake. Insertion of fingers between driving head and stake can result in severe injury to personnel. 1.3.4.3. Due to certain soil conditions or terrain, it may be necessary to provide a person to help stabilize the work stand when in use to avoid injury to personnel. 1.3.4.4.  Wear  protective  clothing  when  operating  hydraulic  tools.  Hydraulic fluid can pose serious health hazards. 1.3.4.5. Wear gloves and hearing protection during MAAS and MRES assembly anchoring. The hydraulic breaker poses injury hazards to unprotected hands and ears. 1.3.4.6. Wear gloves and other protective equipment when handling the breaker and MRES drive gad assembly. The breaker and the drive pieces of the drive gad assembly can become hot enough during installation to cause burns. 1.3.4.7.  The  MAAS  Tire/wheel  assembly  weight  is  approximately  410  lb. Ensure there is adequate lifting capability and personnel to handle this weight. 1.3.4.8.  Do  not  allow  fingers  to  be  placed  between  the  latch  and  installation tools  when  closing  the  latch  on  the  breaker.  Failure  to  comply  can  result  in personal injury. 1.3.5. Operating/Rewind/Engagement. 1.3.5.1.  Before  stretching  tapes,  ensure  the  area  between  the  tow  vehicle  and lead-off sheave is clear of all personnel and equipment. Failure to comply may result in serious injury to personnel and equipment. 1.3.5.2. During rewind and tensioning recommend a minimum safe distance of 30 feet from the pendant/hook cable since it will swing back through the bight. Bight  is  defined  as  the  cable  line  between  the  runway  edge  sheaves.  Serious injury to personnel may result.  1.3.5.3. Do not add fuel, fluid, or oil when the engine is running. A fire could result causing serious injury to personnel or equipment. 1.3.5.4. Do not attempt to remove hook cable while the system is pre-tensioned. Injury to personnel or equipment may result.   10                           AFTTP 3-32.15  21 JUNE 2016 1.3.5.5.  Do  not  attempt  to  remove  MAAS  chain  guards  while  the  engine  is running. Do not run engine with chain guard removed except when performing synchronization or hydraulic system proof testing. 1.3.5.6.  Before  rewind,  clear  area  of  all  personnel  from  tape  sweep  area  (see Attachment 2) and where hook cable will travel.   AFTTP 3-32.15   21 JUNE 2016                                                                             11 Chapter 2 RESOURCES  2.1. MAAS Equipment. The MAAS consists of two identical mobile units with the exception that one trailer is supplied with a 153-ft pendant and the other a 90-ft pendant (Figure 2.1). Each unit  houses a BAK-12 rotary friction energy absorber; contains all basic components of a fixed-base arresting system, and all the  tools  and  hardware  necessary  for  installation  and  removal  (except  for installation  on  soils  with  a  low  bearing  pressure,  which  requires  a  deadman anchoring  system).  The  MAAS  equipment  and  tools  also  support  the  MRES installation and removal. Figure 2.1. MAAS Elevation and Plan Views.    12                           AFTTP 3-32.15  21 JUNE 2016 2.2. MRES Equipment. The MRES system consists of two identical assemblies and  installation  hardware  to  anchor  the  assemblies  on  each  side  of  the  MOS (Figure  2.2).  The  assemblies  route  the  tapes  from  the  MAAS  through  their center-mounted  sheave  assemblies.  The  sheave  assemblies  properly  orient  the tapes to allow smooth payout/pay-in without hang-up or tangling.  Figure 2.2. Typical MRES Installation.  2.2.1. The anchoring equipment supplied with the MRES system, together with the installation equipment and tools supplied as part of the MAAS, provide all of the parts necessary to install and operate the mobile arresting gear system. 2.2.2. The body of the MRES assembly is also the body of an integral trailer. The  MRES  body  is  fitted  with  take-up  assemblies  that  function  not  only  as wheels, but as entire suspension systems to provide smooth transport over most surfaces. The MRES assembly has lights integrated into the body of the trailer. 2.2.3. Regardless of the type of anchors used, the power for the installation tools is  provided  by  the  hydraulic  power  unit  (HPU)  of  the  MAAS.  For  additional information  on  the  HPU,  refer  to  T.O.  35E8-2-10-1,  MAAS  Operations  and Maintenance Instruction Manual.  AFTTP 3-32.15   21 JUNE 2016                                                                             13 Position Component 2.3. Installation Team. An installation team of 12 individuals is recommended to help ensure the rapid mobile arresting gear system installation meets recovery timelines.  Five  team  members  are  Electrical  Power  Production  (3E0X2) technicians, one of them being the Team Lead. The other seven members may be from any specialty; however, the more experienced 3E0X2 technicians on the team,  the  greater  likelihood  the  installation  will  be  accelerated.  Table  2.1 describes the 12-member team distribution and their responsibilities. Note: An engineering technician (3E5X1) is not required for system  alignment, but may help expedite the installation by using survey equipment in place of the manual alignment method identified in T.O. 35E8-2-10-1.

The  mobile  units  (i.e.  trailers)  contain  all  tools  and hardware necessary for installation and removal. Special service tools required for  BAK-12  absorber  maintenance  are  not  provided  with  the  MAAS,  but  the most common tools are included in the MRSP support kit within the AAS Unit Type Code (UTC)-XFSR4. Consumables are also included in the MRSP kit.  All All All All           Vehicle Vehicle-A Vehicle-B   14                           AFTTP 3-32.15  21 JUNE 2016 2.4.1. The only consumable hardware designed into the MAAS and MRES is the anchor nut, used with the bolt in the concrete anchor system. Twenty-four nuts are consumed on each MAAS concrete setback installation. An additional box of 20 is supplied on each MAAS trailer providing 40 spares per system. Twenty-eight  anchor  nuts  are  consumed  on  each  MRES  concrete  installation.  Two additional anchor nuts and bolts are stored on each MRES assembly. 2.4.3.  The  Barrier  Maintenance  UTC-XFSCL  includes  an  AAS  shop  facility, rubber support disc loading machine, and battery maintenance equipment to help expedite AAS installation. 2.4.4.  See  T.O.  35E8-2-10-1  for  a  comprehensive  list  of  installation/removal equipment, tools, and spares.    AFTTP 3-32.15   21 JUNE 2016                                                                             15 Chapter 3 PRE-ATTACK ACTIONS 3.1.  Introduction.  This  chapter  identifies  actions  taken  when  intelligence personnel  report  an  enemy  air  attack  is  probable;  waiting  until  the  attack  is imminent may not provide time necessary for completion. The pre-attack actions within this chapter will help expedite the mobile arresting gear system setback installation during airfield recovery.  3.1.1.  Major  air  attacks  result  in  craters  throughout  the  airfield.  The  crater repairs during rapid recovery operations are suitable for all airframes; therefore, installations  supporting  wide-body  (i.e.  cargo,  transport,  refuelers)  aircraft require  a  mobile  arresting  gear  system  setback  configuration  to  provide necessary  wing  tip  clearance.  The  setback  configuration  is  accomplished  by utilizing the MRES system.  3.1.2.  Installing  the  MRES  system,  especially  in  soil,  is  a  time  consuming process  and  involves  detailed  planning  to  ensure  the  installation  is  completed within  the  8-hour  airfield  recovery  window.  Fortunately,  at  least  one  MRES assembly will most likely be installed on concrete during airfield recovery.  Exception: When installation site pavement is asphalt over soil, 20-feet by 15-feet  of  asphalt  will  have  to  be  removed  in  the  installation  clear  zone  and  the resulting  depression  backfilled  and  compacted  to  match  the  surrounding pavement height. Attempt to achieve a California Bearing Ratio [CBR] of 25 to allow use of small manta-ray anchors. A soil installation will then be performed on this compacted soil patch. Otherwise, the MOS width will be the full runway width and both MRES assemblies installed on soil at the runway’s edge.  3.1.3. A MAAS-only installation immediately adjacent to the MOS during rapid airfield  recovery  is  suitable  for  airfields  supporting  fighter  aircraft  only,  but must be reinstalled in the setback configuration as soon as time permits.  3.2.  Preparing  for  Mobile  Arresting  Gear  System  Setback  Installation. Perform the following pre-attack actions to accelerate the mobile arresting gear system installation (see checklist in Attachment 3). 3.2.1. All Airfields.  3.2.1.1.  If  not  already  available,  conduct  a  runway  profile  identifying longitudinal  and  transverse  slopes  and  CBR  readings  along  the  runway    16                           AFTTP 3-32.15  21 JUNE 2016 shoulders to determine suitable AAS installation sites. If runway and shoulders are constructed of asphalt over soil, determine asphalt thicknesses. 3.2.1.2. Adjust MAAS and MRES turnbuckles (MAAS: 39 inches for concrete or 36 inches for soil; MRES: 30 inches) to their appropriate lengths. 3.2.1.3.  Accomplish  all  required  maintenance  and  inspections  (including synchronization  and  hydraulic  system  proof  test)  on  mobile  arresting  gear system during pre-attack phases to expedite installation during airfield recovery following an attack. 3.2.1.4. Ensure correct cam and cam sprocket is  installed  according to system configuration as indicated in T.O. 35E8-2-10-1. 3.2.1.5. When the MAAS has new tapes installed that have not been previously stretched, recommend temporarily anchoring each trailer in a  suitable location and stretching the tapes as described in T.O. 35E8-2-10-1. Tapes not stretched may  lead  to  longer  runouts,  especially  during  high  energy  arrestments.  Some energy  may remain in tapes  and cause aircraft  walk-back. Tapes not stretched will  also  grow  in  length  during  the  first  couple  of  arrestments.  This  requires cropping  excess  tape  to  accommodate  cable  length.  In  a  multi-arrestment scenario, technicians may not have time to do so. 3.2.2. Airfields Supporting Fighters Only. The runway profile (see paragraph 3.2.1.1) should extend at least 25 feet from runway’s edge. 3.2.3. Airfields Supporting Bomber/Tankers/Mobility and Fighter Aircraft. 3.2.3.1.  In  preparation  for  a  possible  off-center  MOS  with  a  setback  mobile arresting  gear  system  installation,  the  runway  profile  (see  paragraph  3.2.1.1) should extend at least 325 feet from both sides of the runway centerline. 3.2.3.2. From the runway profile, determine which manta-ray anchors provided with the MRES is required  for the soil conditions adjacent to the runway (for hard soil with CBR over 25 or for medium soil with CBR 25 or less). If soil is so soft that it does not support a 10,000-lb proofload of the manta-ray for medium soil, immediately order 6 manta-rays for soft soil (P/N 9D00204-3). 3.2.3.3.  On  one  MRES  trailer  remove  all  soil  installation  tools  and  hardware, install  concrete  installation  brackets,  and  reconfigure  anchor  weldments  to  the installation position (as described in T.O. 35E8-2-10-1) unless runway surface is  AFTTP 3-32.15   21 JUNE 2016                                                                             17 asphalt. If both MRES assemblies are to be installed on concrete and sufficient notice is provided after attack, perform these actions on both trailers.  3.2.3.4. Remove bushings from both MAAS trailer stake pockets and store them in an appropriate location on each trailer. 3.2.3.5. Pull enough tape from both MAAS tape reels to reach approximately 10 feet beyond the distance between the MAAS exit sheave and MRES exit sheave (at least 285 feet) and remove the tape connectors if already installed. This will be  the  tape  reeved  through  the  MRES.  Doing  this  during  pre-attack  actions prevents  having  to  pull  tape  from  the  reels  during  installation.  Roll  up  tape pulled from the reel and secure on the MAAS trailer for transport. 3.2.3.6.  Obtain  a  small  stranded  wire  rope  at  least  120  foot  long  (for  siting component locations), or equivalent, and place in MRES storage compartment. 3.2.3.7. Adjust load-locker pressure relief to 10.5K pounds per square inch (PSI). 3.3.  Expected  Installation  Times.  Installation  times  in  Table  3.1  were accomplished during a mobile arresting gear system installation demonstration conducted  at  Dobbins  ARB,  GA,  in  August  2013.  The  times  included positioning  trailers,  connecting  hook  cable  to  tape  connectors,  tensioning  the hook cable, anchoring components, and synchronizing both absorbers.  Table 3.1.

Introduction. Procedures provided in this chapter assume pre-attack actions described  in  Chapter  3  were  accomplished.  Perform  setback  installation  as described in T.O. 35E8-2-10-1 while incorporating rapid installation procedures within this chapter. See Attachment 4 for installation checklist. 4.2.  Setback  Configuration.  The  MAAS  must  be  setback  from  the  MOS centerline a minimum of 275 feet if both fighter and wide-bodied aircraft will use  the  same  MOS.  This  setback  provides  necessary  wingtip  clearance  when wide-bodied  aircraft  utilize  the  MOS  while  also  placing  the  absorbers  outside the frangibility zone. If conditions during rapid recovery do not allow a setback of the full 275-foot setback, the system will have to be reinstalled at the earliest opportunity after normal operations return. 4.2.1.  General  Information.  The  setback  installation  detailed  here  is  suitable for all arrestments, including bi-directional landings and aborted take-offs. No reduction in installation hardware is authorized for unidirectional installations.  4.2.1.1.  The  MAAS  HPU  provides  power  for  MAAS  and  MRES  installation tools regardless of anchor types used. 4.2.1.2.  If  a  runway  profile  was  not  conducted  during  pre-attack  actions,  an engineering technician (3E5X1) with proper surveying equipment should verify the selected installation site meets slope requirements before installation begins (an engineering technician from each crater repair team should be available after all upheaval on the MAOS  has been  marked). This technician  may also assist with siting components through use of surveying equipment to help expedite the installation. 4.2.2. Manpower Requirements. The T.O. recommends a 7-person work force to install the MRES; however, the MRES was not designed for rapid installation during airfield recovery operations. Legacy concept of operations (CONOP) was to install the MAAS only during airfield recovery and, if  necessary, a setback installation  would  be  installed  as  time  permitted  after  returning  to  normal operations.  Today’s  CONOP  calls  for  a  setback  installation  during  initial recovery at airfields supporting multiple airframes to enable all aircraft types to generate sorties as soon as the MAOS opens.   20                           AFTTP 3-32.15  21 JUNE 2016 4.2.2.1.  The  12-person  team  identified  in  Table  2.1  should  be  assembled  to rapidly  perform  a  setback  installation.  Divide  the  team  into  four  crews  as follows: 4.2.2.1.1. Crew 1—4-person AAS Crew. Responsibilities include: Installs tape connectors •  Sites and positions components •  Lowers MAAS trailers •  Reeves tape through MRES • •  Connects hook cable to tape connectors •  Performs preliminary alignment •  Directs pull-out alignment while operating rewind engines •  Performs synchronization, if not accomplished during pre-attack actions; otherwise, bleeds absorbers’ hydraulic system. •  Performs final inspection of system. •  Crew Lead certifies the system installation 4.2.2.1.2. Crew 2—3-person anchoring crew. Responsibilities include: Install MAAS soil anchors at B1 location • •  When finished anchoring MAAS, transport HPU to MRES B location if required •  Assist Crew 4 with MRES installation 4.2.2.1.3. Crew 3—3-person anchoring crew. Responsibilities include: Install MAAS soil anchors at C1 location • •  When finished anchoring MAAS, transport HPU to MRES C location if required •  Assist Crew 4 with MRES installation 4.2.2.1.4. Crew 4—2-person MRES crew. Responsibilities include: •  Unloads tools and hardware from MRES trailers • Installs  concrete  installation  brackets  and  anchor  weldments  when applicable if not done during pre-attack actions Installs alignment anchors •  Lowers MRES trailers • •  Adjusts turnbuckles during pullout alignment • Installs MRES anchors  AFTTP 3-32.15   21 JUNE 2016                                                                             21 4.2.2.2. The mobile arresting gear system Team Lead has overall responsibility for  the  installation  and  must  utilize  all  personnel  effectively  to  minimize installation  time.  Many  installation  steps  are  performed  simultaneously  by different team members as directed by the Team Lead.  4.2.3.  Installation  Site  Selection.  The  MAOS  Selection  Team  will  determine the  mobile  arresting  gear  system  installation  site  depending  on  the  particular operational need and airfield layout. A portion of the runway should be selected that allows for a touchdown zone, a tape sweep area, and an aircraft clear zone beyond  the  1,200  foot  maximum  rollout.  Allow  approximately  100  additional feet for clearing the aircraft after an arrestment. For bi-directional installations, these distances must be considered in both directions. If a runway profile was not  accomplished  during  pre-attack  actions,  the  Team  Lead  must  ensure appropriate  surveying  equipment  and  personnel  are  available  to  verify  slope requirements. 4.2.3.1. MRES Site Requirements. The most advantageous installation site will locate both, or at least one, MRES trailer on concrete as this configuration can be  installed  faster  than  the  soil  installation.  The  anticipated  site  should  be checked  by  the  mobile  arresting  gear  system  Team  Lead  to  verify  positioning requirements  are  met  before  beginning  installation.  See  MRES  complete  site requirements in T.O. 35E8-2-10-1.  4.2.3.2. MAAS Site Requirements. The setback distance should be at least 275 feet. Setback distance is defined as the total distance from the MOS centerline to the exit point of the MAAS edge sheaves. Shorter setback installations are only acceptable  in  order  to  take  advantage  of  existing  site  conditions.  See  MAAS complete site requirements in T.O. 35E8-2-10-1.  Note: Under no circumstances should the setback distance be shortened based upon  available  tape  length.  If  necessary,  acquire  new  1500  foot  tapes  for  the setback installation. WARNING Tape  stack  height  dimension  is  a  function  of  tape  length  (allowable  aircraft runout) and tape reel diameter. Following the installation of the MAAS and the MRES, the tape edge distance must not exceed the limits given in T.O. 35E8-2-10-1, Table 5-5. Failure to adhere to these limits will result in reduced allowable runout and may result in aircraft damage and loss of life.   22                           AFTTP 3-32.15  21 JUNE 2016 4.2.4.  Marking  Component  Locations.  After  selecting  a  site  based  upon  the requirements given above, the exact locations of the system components must be determined and  marked prior to installation. Mark  the component locations as described  in  T.O.  35E8-2-10-1.  When  available,  an  engineering  technician (3E5X1)  may  use  surveying  equipment  to  expedite  marking  component locations. 4.2.5. Positioning Components. Each tow vehicle should have a MAAS trailer connected to its pintle-hook and an MRES trailer connected to the MAAS trailer for tandem towing. 4.2.5.1.  The  tow  vehicle  approaches  the  MOS  perpendicular  to  the  centerline with the center of the MRES trailer centered on Points B and B1 (Figure 4.1). Figure 4.1. Typical Positioning, Setback Trailer System.  4.2.5.2.  As  MRES  trailer  approaches  Point  B,  the  Team  Lead  signals  tow vehicle  operator  to  stop  when  front  tape  sheaves  are  centered  on Point  B.  Set both  trailer  hand  brakes  and  disconnect  from  tow  vehicle.  Crew  4  performs MRES trailer unloading and installation preparation steps (if not accomplished during pre-attack actions) identified in T.O. 35E8-2-10-1.  4.2.5.3.  Position  one  HPU  from  the  MAAS  trailer  next  to  the  MRES  trailer location.  AFTTP 3-32.15   21 JUNE 2016                                                                             23 4.2.5.4. The tow vehicle then swings around to the right and approaches Point B1 while parallel to the MOS. 4.2.5.5. As the MAAS trailer approaches Point B1, the Team Lead directs the tow vehicle operator when to stop so that the center of the tape exit sheaves have traveled  approximately  6-inches  beyond  Point  B1.  The  trailer  will  move backwards approximately 6-inches as it lowers to the ground. 4.2.5.6. When lowering, ensure cross runway alignment of the trailer sheave exit points are within plus or minus 1 foot of the line perpendicular to the runway centerline. 4.2.5.7. Perform  same procedure on opposite side of runway for Points  C and C1. 4.2.6.  Preliminary  Alignment.  Perform  preliminary  alignment  as  directed  in TO 35E8-2-10-1. Pay particular attention to the following points: 4.2.6.1. Verify that 90 degree tape twist on each side of runway between each MAAS  exit  sheaves  and  each  MRES  assembly’s  rear  sheave  is  in  the  same direction relative to the runway. 4.2.6.2. The tensioned tape and pendent should form a straight line from the exit sheave of the MAAS, through the MRES trailer, across the runway, through the opposite MRES trailer, and into the opposite MAAS sheave.  4.2.6.3. Reposition MRES assemblies as required to remove any bow from tape while keeping front sheaves at Marks B and C. 4.2.7. Install MRES Alignment Anchors. Install applicable alignment anchors (i.e. concrete, soil) as described in T.O. 35E8-2-10-1. 4.2.8. Pull-Out Alignment. Perform pull-out alignment IAW T.O. 35E8-2-10-1. 4.2.8.1. Recommend that at least two MAAS body stakes be installed on either side  of  the  stake-line  anchor  point  prior  to  performing  the  pull-out  alignment (Figure  4.2).  This  will  ensure  the  trailer  does  not  move  during  pull-out alignment. 4.2.8.2.  Perform  pullout  alignment  on  both  sides  simultaneously  by  hooking pull-vehicle to the pendent.     24                           AFTTP 3-32.15  21 JUNE 2016 Figure 4.2. Body Stakes to Install Prior to Pull-Out Alignment.  4.2.8.3.  Adjust  the  MRES  trailer  alignment  by  loosening  one  turnbuckle  first and  tightening  the  opposite  alignment  turnbuckle  to  pull  the  assembly  into alignment. 4.2.8.4.  Tighten  MRES  alignment  turnbuckles,  without  moving  the  trailer,  to hold it in position during anchoring. 4.2.9. MRES Installation Procedures.  4.2.9.1. Concrete Installation. Perform installation as directed in T.O. 35E8-2-10-1. 4.2.9.1.1. It is imperative a spotter ensure holes being drilled are as vertical as possible;  otherwise,  taper  bolts  may  be  difficult  or  impossible  to  install completely. 4.2.9.1.2.  All  14  taper  bolts  are  required  and  must  be  installed  to  provide  the proper safety margin. 4.2.9.2. Soil Installation. Perform installation as directed in TO 35E8-2-10-1.  Note: Because the mobile arresting gear system must be relocated if any of the six  manta-ray  load  tests  fail  on  either  MRES  assembly,  recommend  installing stakes only  in the four corners of each MRES assembly prior to installing the manta-rays and load testing them. 4.2.9.2.1. Install a body stake in the three corners that do not have a stake driven already (the alignment pivot-point stake was previously driven in one corner for the pull-out alignment). Do not drive body stakes below the top rim of the stake pockets.  AFTTP 3-32.15   21 JUNE 2016                                                                             25 4.2.9.2.2. Install the appropriate manta-ray anchors, according to the CBR of the installation  site  (see  paragraph  3.2.3.2),  before  installing  the  remaining  body stakes.  4.2.9.2.2.1. Ensure the load locker base frame is securely tightened to the trailer frame before driving the manta-ray anchors or when setting the anchors with the load-locker.  Periodically  check  tightness  of  the  load-locker  base  frame  to prevent misalignment. 4.2.9.2.2.2. If relief valve on the load-locker cannot be set to open at 10,500 psi, use  the  operating  lever  to  keep  the  pressure  at  10,000  psi.  Setting  and  proof-testing the anchors using pressure above 10,500 psi may cause the pulling bar to move more than 0.5 inch during the one minute test period. 4.2.9.2.2.3.  If  the  manta-ray  anchors  selected  will  not  set  and  hold  during proofloading  with  the  load-locker,  the  system  must  be  moved  to  another  area with  a  higher  CBR  reading.  If  soil  conditions  are  similar,  larger  manta-ray anchors may be required in the new location. 4.2.9.2.3.  Drive  the  remaining  body  stakes.  The  24  body  stakes  in  the  center sections of the MRES should be driven into the ground until 8 to 10 inches of the  stake  remains  exposed  above  ground  level.  The  8  stakes  in  the  sloped sections  should  be  driven  until  approximately  6.5  inches  of  the  stake  remains exposed  above  ground  level.  Make  certain  stakes  are  driven  deep  enough  to allow covers to sit flush. 4.2.10. MAAS Setback Installation Procedures. Divide personnel into 4 crews as described in Table 2.1 and perform installation IAW TO 35E8-2-10-1. 4.2.10.1. Concrete Installation. The MAAS trailer exit sheaves are setback 275 feet from the MOS centerline. This distance will almost assuredly require a soil installation.  If  the  installation  site  is  concrete,  perform  a  setback  concrete installation as described in T.O. 35E8-2-10-1. 4.2.10.2. Soil Installation. Pay particular attention to the following points: 4.2.10.2.1. Install 10 MAAS trailer body stakes first; drive stakes until only 18 inches  are  exposed  above  ground.  When  finished,  count  the  body  stakes  to ensure all 10 were installed. 4.2.10.2.2.  The  KM  anchoring  system  should  be  installed  on  level  ground  to keep proper alignment (remove soil on high spots and add soil to low spots).   26                           AFTTP 3-32.15  21 JUNE 2016 4.2.11. Preparation for Use. Prepare the system for use following procedures in TO 35E8-2-10-1. Pay particular attention to the following points: 4.2.11.1.  Place  a  storage  bag  over  each  MRES  brake  drum  and  hub  for protection. 4.2.11.2. Using a truck or similar tow vehicle, pull tapes down the runway about 300 feet. Observe tape tracking through entire mobile arresting gear system to ensure proper alignment. 4.2.11.3. Proofloading is not mandatory under combat or emergency conditions. However,  proofload  the  mobile  arresting  gear  system  IAW  T.O.  35E8-2-10-1 when  time  is  available,  as  it  is  always  preferred  to  test  the  MAAS  anchoring system  after  installation  by  imposing  a  load  on  the  nylon  tape  similar  to  the loading  experienced  during  an  aircraft  engagement.  One  of  the  purposes  of proofloading  is  to  find  problems  with  the  anchoring.  It  should  highlight  loose components which may cause the system to shift during use. Proofloading will also stretch new tapes if not stretched during pre-attack actions as identified in paragraph 3.2.1.  4.2.11.4.  Perform  tape  stack  height  measurement;  replace  tapes  if  out  of tolerance. 4.2.11.5. Pendant/hook cable should be supported above the runway surface by pendant/hook cable support discs. Space the disks 6 to 10 feet apart to support the  bottom  of  the  pendant/hook  cable  is  a  minimum  of  2  inches  above  the runway surface to facilitate positive engagement by the aircraft tail hook. Should cable tend to sag due to extreme runway crown, spacing distance may be slightly reduced to maintain 2 inch clearance. If effective pendant height is less than 1.5 inches schedule corrective action as soon as possible. 4.2.11.6.  Two  hundred  feet  of  pavement  on  both  the  approach  and  departure sides  of  the  pendant/cable  are  deemed  as  critical  areas.  The  maximum permissible longitudinal surface deviation in this area is ±0.125 inches within a length  of  12-feet.  Saw-cut  grooves  in  runway  pavement  to  improve  surface drainage and surface friction  characteristics in accordance with UFC 3-260-02 are not considered protruding objects or undulations. Changes in pavement type or an interface between rigid and flexible pavements are not permitted within the center  75-foot  of  the  MOS  in  critical  areas  of  pavement.  The  prohibition  on changes  in  surface  pavement  type  is  not  applicable  to  emergency  aircraft arresting  systems  located  in  overruns.  Protruding  objects  and  undulating  JOHN B.
