The  AFSOC  Command  and  Control  (C2)  system  is  based  on  the  principles  of centralized monitoring and decentralized command and control and execution.  The result is a C2 mechanism which keeps the AFSOC/CC informed of the current status of AFSOC forces while enabling  the  Wing/CC,  Group/CC,  or  Squadron/CC  to  exercise  control  over  the  day-to-day operations. 2.2.  Operational  Control  (OPCON).  AFSOC  is  designated  as  the  controlling  agency  for United  States  Special  Operations  Command  (USSOCOM)-assigned  Air  Force  Special Operations Forces (AFSOF) aircraft, while the Theater Special Operations Commands (TSOCs) have OPCON of theater-based assets.      Exception:  In practice, responsibility for planning and executing AFSOC missions is routinely delegated to the Wing/CC or Group/CC.  The Wing/CC or  Group/CC,  in  turn,  exercises  control  of  non-close-hold  missions  through  command  post supporting  wing  or  group.    In  the  event  that  assigned  forces  undergo  a  change  in  operation control (CHOP), responsibility for mission monitoring passes from the wing or group C2 facility to the gaining command.  Changeover will be accomplished IAW the pertinent operational plan (OPLAN),  operational  order  (OPORD),  deployment  order  (DEPORD),  or  execution  order (EXORD).    (T-2)                      Note:    For  certain  close-hold  activities,  security  considerations  may compel  the  Wing  or  Group  Commander  to  shift  mission  monitoring  responsibilities  from  the command  post  to  another  wing,  group,  or  theater  agency.    The  Wing/CC  or  Group/CC  will ensure  procedures  are  established  for  the  responsible  agency  to  monitor  mission  progress  and advise the HQ AFSOC/A3 or HQ AFSOF/CC as appropriate.  (T-2) 2.3.  Mission  Monitoring.  Except  for  selected  close-hold  missions,  the  respective  wings command post monitors assigned aircraft moving to, from, or between off-station locations.  The command post tracks off-station aircraft via the Air Mobility Command (AMC) C2 system and direct  reporting  from  aircrew  and  command  post  personnel.    Key  components  of  the  AMC  C2 system  are  the  Airlift  Implementation  and  Monitoring  System  (AIMS),  the  Global  Decision Support  System  (GDSS),  and  various  AMC  C2  facilities  at  theater  and  wing  locations.  Information  on  scheduled  activity  comes  from  the  wings,  which  input  AIMS  data  for  all upcoming missions except  local  missions not  scheduled to  land outside the local  flying area or close-hold  missions  that  cannot  be  accommodated  by  classified    J  coded  AIMS  setups.    When aircraft are deployed in support of operations and exercises, the command post obtains additional information  from  Situation  Reports  (SITREP)  and  Deployed  Status  Reports  (DSR).    The following mission monitoring procedures primarily apply to missions that are not close-hold in nature and have not been CHOP’d to another command: 2.3.1.  Wing  (or  equivalent)  command  posts  track  continental  United  States  (CONUS) movements  of  their  aircraft  and  directly  input  mission  information  into  the  GDSS.    These actions keep the MAJCOM/CC informed of the status and location of CONUS forces. 2.3.2.  Information  on outside continental United  States (OCONUS) movements of AFSOC aircraft  (CONUS  or  theater-based)  comes  to  the  AFSOC  Command  Center  via  GDSS  or telephone notification from the overseas host unit command posts.  The host unit command   14  AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015 posts  receive  their  data  from  the  aircrews  directly  or  via  the  Special  Operations  Command and Control Squadron or Element (SOCCS or SOCCE). 2.3.3.  Unclassified Missions at Bases with an AMC C2 Facility.  The Mission Commander (MC) or PIC should ensure the following information is  relayed to the  AMC C2 facility at least 30 minutes prior to landing:  call sign(s), mission number(s), estimated time of arrival (ETA),  maintenance  status,  and  additional  service  requirements.    After  landing,  the  MC  or PIC  will  contact  the  C2  facility  with  ground  handling  requirements  and  departure information.  In addition, CONUS-based crews operating within the CONUS must keep their home  station  command  posts  appraised  of  all  actual  takeoff  and  landing  times,  projected takeoff times, and other related information.  (T-3) 2.3.4.  Unclassified  Missions  at  Bases  without  an  AMC  C2  Facility.    The  MC  or  PIC  will report,  as  soon  as  possible,  actual  takeoff  and  landing  times,  maintenance  status,  projected takeoff  times,  and  other  pertinent  data  to  the  theater  command  post/reporting  agency  or AFSOC  Command  Center.    Methods  of  communicating  this  information  include  high frequency (HF) phone patch, Defense Switched Network (DSN), and commercial telephone.  CONUS-based crews operating within the CONUS must also ensure that their home station command posts receive real-time reports on aircraft movements.  (T-3) 2.3.5.  J-coded  AIMS  Missions.    When  operating  on  J-coded  missions, the  MC  or  PIC  will pass  movement  reports  to  the  appropriate  C2  facility.    The  MC  or  PIC  will  make arrangements with the theater command post/reporting agency or AFSOC Command Center to  pass  pertinent  flight  information via secure voice or data  communications.    If necessary, call  on  an  unclassified  line  and  report.    For  example,  “Loaded  and  ready  to  go,  Estimated Time  of  Departure  (ETD)  is  as  fragged”.    (T-2)            Note:    For  missions  requiring  special handling  above  and  beyond  basic  J-code  procedures,  C2  procedures  will  be  outlined  in  the tasking directive. 2.3.6.  Close-Hold or Sensitive Missions.  These missions may operate without AIMS setups.  Reference the note preceding this paragraph. 2.3.7.  Regional  Reporting  Agencies.    27th  Special  Operations  Wing  (SOW)  and  below taskings:  27 SOW Command Center, Cannon AFB NM, DSN 681-2253 or (575) 784-2253.  Air  Force  Special  Operations  Air  Warfare  Center  (AFSOAWC)  and  below  taskings:    919 SOW Command Post, Duke Field, FL, DSN 875-6701 or (850) 883-6701. 2.4.  Designation  of  a  COMAFSOF.  The  USSOCOM,  AFSOC,  or  TSOC  Commander  may designate a COMAFSOF.  This should be done in writing, and the designation letter will include the  individual  by  name,  and  the  geographic  area  of  authority.    In  the  absence  of  a  designated COMAFSOF,  HQ  AFSOC/A3  may  grant  COMAFSOF  waiver  authority  to  an  individual  in writing.    Update  the  designation  letter  to  reflect  personnel  changes  due  to  prolonged deployments.    A  copy  of  the  designation  letter  will  be  maintained  by  the  AFSOC  Command Center and the designated COMAFSOF.  (T-2) 2.5.  Mission  Commander  (MC).  A  MC  will  be  designated  when  more  than  one  aircraft  or crew  are  deployed  away  from  home  station  for  training,  exercises,  or  other  operations.  Designated  MCs  must  have  attended  the  AFSOAWC  Mission  Commanders  Course.    Waiver authority  for  this  requirement  is  OG/CC.    (T-3)      The  MC  will  be  a  mission  ready  aircraft commander and should not be used as a primary crew member.  In cases where it is necessary for AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015   15  the  MC  to  fly,  ensure  a  senior  unit  member  or  designated  representative  is  delegated  to  fulfill MC duties.  The MC’s responsibilities include, but are not limited to: 2.5.1.  Briefing crews on local operating procedures. 2.5.2.  Coordinating with Air Traffic Control (ATC), Combat Control Teams (CCT), Special Tactics  Squadron  (STS)  teams,  range  control,  users,  and  other  agencies  that  may  have  an impact on the mission. 2.5.3.  Ensuring that Forward Area Refueling Point (FARP) locations, Drop Zones (DZ), or Landing Zones (LZ) have current surveys (when necessary). 2.5.4.  Ensuring  personnel  have  ample  and  adequate  billeting,  eating,  and  transportation arrangements. 2.5.5.  Ensuring maintenance personnel know of aircraft and fuel requirements. 2.5.6.  Submitting  timely  reports  on  aircraft  movements  and  mission  situational  reports (SITREP) (reference Paragraph 2.3.4). 2.6.  Pilot  in  Command  Responsibility  (PIC)  and  Authority.  AF  Form  4327A,  Crew  Flight Authorization (FA), designates a PIC for all flights.  The PIC is: 2.6.1.  In command of all persons aboard the aircraft. 2.6.2.  Responsible  for  the  welfare  of  their  crew,  Mission  Essential  Personnel  (MEP), passengers, and the safe accomplishment of the mission. 2.6.3.  Vested with the authority necessary to manage the crew and accomplish the mission. 2.6.4.  The  final  mission  authority  and  will  make  decisions  not  specifically  assigned  to  a higher authority. 2.6.5.  The final authority for accepting a waiver affecting the crew or mission. 2.6.6.  Charged  with  keeping  the  applicable  commander  informed  of  mission  progress  and difficulties. 2.6.7.  Responsible for the timely reporting of aircraft movements in the absence of a MC. 2.7.  Mission Clearance Decision.  The final decision to delay a mission may be made either by the agency with OPCON or the PIC when, in the opinion of either, conditions are not safe to start or continue a mission.  Final responsibility for the safe conduct of the mission rests with the PIC.  If  the  PIC  refuses  a  mission,  it  will  not  depart  until  the  conditions  have  been  corrected  or improved so that the mission can operate safely.  Another PIC and aircrew will not be alerted to take the same mission under the same conditions. 2.7.1.  Diverting  or  rerouting  a  mission  should  be  authorized  by  the  commander  with OPCON,  except  in  an  emergency  or  when  required  by  en  route  or  terminal  weather conditions or facilities.  In the event of an emergency or weather-related divert or reroute, the MC or PIC must notify the controlling authority as soon as possible. 2.7.2.  The controlling agency directing the diversion or rerouting is responsible for ensuring destination requirements or facilities are adequate for the aircraft and aircrew. 2.7.3.  The PIC will notify  the  controlling  agency  of  any  aircraft or aircrew limitations that may preclude diverting or rerouting the mission.   16  AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015 2.7.4.  When directing an aircraft to  an alternate airfield, the controlling agency will ensure the PIC is provided existing and forecasted weather for the alternate.  If the planned alternate is unsuitable upon arrival at destination, the controlling agency will advise the PIC of other suitable alternates. 2.8.  Civilian Law Enforcement Support.  It is the policy of the Department of Defense (DoD) to  cooperate  with  civilian  law  enforcement  officials  to  the  maximum  extent  practicable.  AFI 10801,  Defense  Support  of  Civilian  Authorities  (DSCA),  incorporates  the  appropriate directive  and  provides  uniform  policies  and  procedures  service  members  must  follow  when supporting  federal,  state,  and  local  civilian  law  enforcement  agencies.    It  establishes  specific limitations and restrictions on the use of Air Force personnel, equipment, facilities, and services by civilian law enforcement organizations.  Report all requests for assistance and coordinate all requests from civilian law enforcement authorities through the appropriate C2 channels. AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015   17  Chapter 3 AIRCREW COMPLEMENT AND MANAGEMENT 3.1.  Aircrew Qualification.  Each person assigned as a primary crew member must be qualified or in training for qualification in that crew position, mission, and aircraft.  (T-2) 3.1.1.  Basic  proficiency  crew  members  may  perform  primary  crew  duties  on  any  non-mission  sortie  and  on  mission  sorties  (including  unilateral  training,  joint  training,  and exercises) when receiving mission qualification training or evaluations under the supervision of a qualified instructor or flight examiner in their respective crew position. 3.1.2.  Mission  capable  crew  members  may  perform  primary  crew  duties  on  any  unilateral training mission.  For other missions, the squadron commander must determine the readiness of each mission capable crew member to perform primary duties. 3.1.3.  Noncurrent  (NC)  or  Unqualified  (UNQ)  pilots  may  perform  crew  duties  only  on designated training or evaluation missions under the supervision of a qualified instructor or flight examiner pilot. 3.1.4.  Other NC or UNQ crew members required for a mission may perform duties in their primary  crew  position  on  any  mission  when  under  the  direct  supervision  of  a  qualified instructor or flight examiner in their respective crew position. 3.2.  Crew  Complement.  The  minimum  crew  complement  for  flight  operations  is  specified  in Table  3.1.   The  squadron  commander  may  add  crew  members  to  enhance  mission accomplishment or maximize training.  (T-3) Table 3.1.  Crew Complement.

C-145A  aircraft  are  considered  Transport  aircraft  and  will  comply  with  FDP  criteria outlined in AFI 11-202, Vol 3, Chapter 9.  (T-2) 3.6.1.1.  The  basic  FDP  is  16  hours  providing  no  training  events  or  FCFs  (including maintenance  ground  runs)  are  accomplished  after  12  hours.    Exception:    ANG  and AFRC crews may perform all mission related events on local training missions provided their time from start of Crew Duty Time/FDP does not exceed 16 hours.  (T-2) 3.6.1.2.  Aircrews may recover to a basing location with a tactical recovery, to include the use  of  NVGs,  after  16  hours  provided  the  mission  execution  portion  of  the  sortie terminates before exceeding 12 hours.  (T-2) 3.6.1.3.  For  unusual  or  unforeseen  circumstances  that  impact  the  scheduled  FDP,  PICs may  extend  their  FDP  up  to  2  hours  provided  no  training,  tactical  events,  pilot proficiency  maneuvers,  or  FCF  events  occur  within  the  2  hour  extension.    PICs  must assess  the  impact  of  the  extension  on  the  crew  and  weigh  all  available  options  before extending the scheduled FDP.  If this option is used, the PIC must also coordinate with command  and  control  agencies  so  follow-on  activities  or  schedules  are  not  adversely affected.  (T-2) 3.7.  Crew Rest.  In addition to the restrictions in AFI 11-202, Vol 3, Chapter 9, comply with the following: 3.7.1.  Under  unusual  circumstances,  and  when  waived  by  the  appropriate  authority,  it  is permissible for crew members not previously placed in crew rest to fly if they are sufficiently rested.  (T-3) 3.7.2.  Stand-Down Policy.  Personnel deployed in contingency operations for 46 to 90 days will be afforded, if possible, by their respective commander a 4-day pass followed by 3 days (present for duty) with the duty location being their local area home.  Personnel deployed in contingency operations for 91 or more days will be afforded, if possible, by their respective commander a 4-day pass followed by 10 days (present for duty) with the duty location being their  home.    The  squadron  commander  will  define  the  local  area  in  Chapter  10  of  this publication.  (T-3) 3.7.3.  The  aircraft  crew  chief  or  maintainer  traveling  with  the  aircraft  is  responsible  to  the PIC.    The  PIC  will  determine  how  long  the  crew  chief  or  maintainer  can  safely  perform   20  AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015 aircraft recovery actions.  The crew chief must have the opportunity to sleep eight hours of each 24-hour period.  (T-3) 3.8.  Standby  Duty.  A  period  of  time  during  which  a  crew  may  be  required  to  launch  on  an anticipated mission for which a firm departure time cannot be established. 3.8.1.  Aircrew members will be provided a 12-hour inviolate crew rest period preceding the start of standby duty.  (T-3) 3.8.2.  Aircrew  not  dispatched  on  a  mission  following  standby  duty  will  be  re-entered  into crew rest or receive post-mission crew rest (if applicable).  (T-3) 3.9.  Alert Duty.  Reference AFI 11-202, Vol 3, for alert FDP guidance. 3.9.1.  Give alert aircrews a general briefing at the beginning of each alert period.  Update the briefing  every  24  hours  to  include  weather,  local  Notice  to  Airman  (NOTAM),  latest  FCIF information, special instructions, and any other appropriate items.  (T-3) 3.9.2.  Alert  aircrews  will  prepare  a  weight  and  balance  for  the  alert  aircraft  and  are authorized  to  prepare  takeoff  and  landing  data  (TOLD)  using  the  worst  weather  conditions expected during the alert period.  Use this data only for alert scrambles.  If the alert aircraft is flown for other reasons, compute data for that flight using existing weather conditions.  (T-3) 3.9.3.  When  an  alert  crew  change  occurs  and  the  same  aircraft  remains  on  alert,  the oncoming alert crew will complete a face-to-face turnover and review the aircraft forms for the aircraft.  If unable to accomplish a face-to-face turnover, accomplish a preflight.  (T-3) 3.10.  Crew  Notification  and  Show  Times.  Publish  crew  notification  procedures  and  mission show times in Chapter 10 of this instruction. AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015   21  Chapter 4 AIRCRAFT OPERATING GUIDELINES 4.1.  Objectives.  A fully mission capable aircraft is the ultimate objective of the logistics effort.  The  final  responsibility  regarding  equipment  required  for  a  mission  rests  with  the  PIC.    If  one crew accepts an aircraft to operate a mission or mission segment without an item or system, this acceptance does not commit that crew, or a different crew, to accept subsequent operations with the  same  item  or  system  inoperative.    When  the  PIC  considers  an  item  essential,  designate  the component  Mission  Essential  (ME)  on  the  aircraft  maintenance  forms,  and  the  item  will  be repaired or replaced prior to departure. 4.1.1.  The PIC is the approval authority for operations with degraded equipment within the guidelines of the aircraft Master Minimum  Equipment  List (MMEL).   Operating outside of the  aircraft  MMEL  guidelines  requires  Group/CC  or  COMAFSOF  approval.   For contingency  operations  when  communication  issues  prevent  any  possibility  of  a  waiver request, the PIC is the approval authority for operating outside the aircraft MMEL guidelines but must notify the chain of command of the situation as soon as conditions permit.  Tactical and  airdrop  missions  fall  outside  the  scope  of  the  MEL  and  the  PIC  will  ensure  that equipment necessary for the mission being flown is operational.  (T-3) 4.1.2.  One-Time Flights.  An aircraft may be released for a one time flight with a condition that might be hazardous for continued use provided the aircraft is airworthy for one flight to another station.  A one-time flight is defined as a required flight to a suitable repair facility including required fuel stops.  (T-2) 4.1.2.1.  The squadron commander, chief of maintenance, MC, or deployed maintenance representative must authorize this release. 4.1.2.2.  The  OG/CC  or  COMAFSOF  must  authorize  the  flight  after  maintenance  has released the aircraft for flight operations. 4.1.2.3.  The  maintenance  release,  OG/CC  or  COMAFSOF  approval,  and  the  PIC’s concurrence  are  all  required  before  the  aircraft  can  be  flown  to  the  specified  repair destination. 4.2.  Policy.  If  the  PIC  elects  to  operate  with  degraded  equipment  or  aircraft  systems,  the  PIC will  coordinate  mission  requirements  (i.e.,  revised  departure  times,  fuel  requirements, maintenance  requirements,  etc.)  prior  to  flight  with  the  mission  control  agency  to  ensure  the decision  does  not  adversely  impact  follow-on  missions.    Reference  the  aircraft  MMEL  for degraded equipment restrictions.  (T-3) 4.2.1.  The  PIC  will  determine  the  flight  restrictions  or  operating  restrictions  of  any equipment installed in the C-145A that is not listed in the MMEL.  Such items may include but not limited to NVG lighting, airdrop equipment, secure radios, or other specific mission items.  (T-3) 4.2.2.  Radar.

Advisory  Calls  During  Instrument  Flight  Rules  (IFR)  Operations.  The  following  are mandatory altitude calls made by the PNF:   26  AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015 5.8.1.  Non-Precision Approaches. 5.8.1.1.  “100  above”  when  100  feet  above  minimum  descent  altitude  (MDA)  or  step down altitude. 5.8.1.2.  “Minimums” at MDA. 5.8.1.3.  “Runway in sight” when the runway environment is in sight and the aircraft is in a position to execute a safe landing. 5.8.1.4.  “Go-around” at or below MDA or at the missed approach point and the runway environment  is  not  in  sight,  when  the  aircraft  is  not  in  a  position  to  execute  a  safe landing, when directed by ATC facility, or conditions on the runway will not allow a safe landing (e.g., personnel, equipment, or aircraft on the runway). 5.8.2.  Precision Approaches. 5.8.2.1.  “100  above”  when  100  feet  above  final  approach  altitude,  glideslope  intercept altitude, or decision height (DH). 5.8.2.2.  “Continue”  at  DH  with  approach  light  system  visible  and  the  aircraft  is  in  a position to execute a safe landing.  Do not continue the approach below 100 feet if usable runway visual cues are not present. 5.8.2.3.  “Land”  at  DH  with  the  runway  environment  in  sight  and  the  aircraft  is  in  a position to execute a safe landing. 5.8.2.4.  “Go-around” at or below DH and the runway environment is not in sight or if the aircraft is not in a position to execute a safe landing, when directed by ATC facility, or conditions  on  the  runway  will  not  allow  a  safe  landing  (e.g.,  personnel,  equipment,  or aircraft on the runway). 5.8.3.  Climb/Descent. 5.8.3.1.  “1,000 feet above/below” assigned altitude or flight level. 5.8.4.  Altimeter  Settings.    Both  pilots  will  state  and  set  the  altimeter  setting  as  issued  by ATC, weather reporting facilities or when passing a Transition Level or Altitude (e.g., Flight Level 180). 5.8.5.  Deviations: 5.8.5.1.  Any crew member will immediately advise the PF when observing unannounced heading deviations  greater than 10°, airspeed deviations of 10 knots, altitude deviations of 100 feet during approach or 200 feet while en route, or potential terrain or obstruction problems and no attempt is being made by the PF to correct the deviation. 5.8.5.2.  Any crew member will announce deviations from prescribed procedures for the approach being flown to the PF when no attempt is being made to correct the deviation. 5.9.  Communications Guidance.  The PIC will determine communication requirements during mission  planning.   Ensure  all  mission  frequencies,  cryptological  data,  mission  radio configuration,  and  mission  radio  monitoring  responsibilities  are  outlined  during  the  preflight briefing.    Classified  interphone  or  radio  transmissions  will  be  recorded  on  the  cockpit  voice AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015   27  recorder (CVR), if installed, and CVR is operating.  Ensure any recorded classified conversations are removed.  When available, all crew members will monitor the aircraft interphone. 5.10.  Crosswind  Limits.  The  C-145A  is  limited  to  a  demonstrated  takeoff  and  landing crosswind  limit  of  19  kts.    Refer  to  the  POH  for  the  complete  listing  of  crosswind  limitations under various conditions.  (T-1) 5.11.  Wake Turbulence Avoidance. 5.11.1.  The  PIC  will  exercise  caution  when  conducting  taxi  or  flight  operations  within  the vicinity of helicopter(s) or tilt-rotor aircraft.  In a slow hover-taxi or stationary hover near the surface,  helicopter  main  rotor(s)  or  tiltrotor  aircraft  generate  downwash  producing  high velocity  vortices  to  a  distance  approximately  three  times  the  diameter  of  the  rotor.    In forward flight, departing or landing helicopters or tilt-rotor aircraft produce a pair of strong, high-speed trailing vortices similar to wing tip vortices of larger fixed wing aircraft.  (T-1) 5.11.2.  Refer  to  AFMAN  11-217,  Vol  2,  FLIP  General  Planning  (GP),  and  the  Airman‘s Information Manual (AIM) for additional wake turbulence information and wake turbulence avoidance techniques.  A reliable timing source will be used to ensure appropriate separation is  achieved.          WARNING:  Wind  can affect  the path  and duration of wake turbulence thereby  prolonging  the  turbulence  hazard  or  placing  the  turbulence  in  an  unanticipated location.    The  PF  is  expected  to  adjust  aircraft  operations  and  flight  path  as  necessary  to preclude serious wake turbulence encounters. 5.12.  LZ and LZ Markings. 5.12.1.  The  LZ  program  is  a  squadron  tactics  function.    The  squadron  tactics  office  must ensure surveys are conducted and updated IAW AFI 13-217, Drop Zone and Landing Zone Procedures, and the procedures below.   It  is  the responsibility of  all aircrew and/or  ground personnel  to  notify  the  point  of  contact  (POC)  for  the  squadron  LZ  survey  program,  in  a timely manner, of any changes or discrepancies on existing surveys. 5.12.2.  A  thorough  review  of  the  LZ  survey  and  accompanying  photographs,  computer drawings,  or  imagery  will  be  accomplished  by  all  crew  members  during  the  aircrew  brief.  The PIC is  responsible for ensuring that  any crew member unable to  attend the brief either reviews the landing zone survey or is briefed on the hazards associated with the LZ.  (T-3) 5.12.3.  Aircrews may conduct airland operations at airfields specified in AFI 13-217, Drop Zone and Landing Zone Procedures.  (T-2) 5.12.4.  Tactical  LZ surveys may be used during exercises and operational missions when a full  LZ  survey  is  unavailable  due  to  the  situation.    Requests  to  use  tactical  surveys  will  be forwarded to OG/CC or COMAFSOF for review and approval.  (T-2) 5.12.5.  The  OG/CC  or  COMAFSOF  may  approve  the  use  of  other  DoD  services  or  host nation equivalent LZ surveys.  (T-2) 5.12.6.  LZ  markings  may  vary  depending  upon  the  supporting  agency  or  airfield construction.    Refer  to  AFI  13-217,  Drop  Zone  and  Landing  Zone  Procedures,  for  LZ marking  descriptions.    The  overt  and  covert  markings  and  signals  to  be  used  during  LZ operations will be established during mission planning and included in the aircrew briefing.   28  AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015 5.12.6.1.  C-145A aircrews may land at an LZ marked with any Airfield Marking Pattern (AMP) configuration IAW AFI 13-217, Drop Zone and Landing Zone Procedures, or this instruction provided the pilots define identifiable touchdown and go-around points (e.g., visual point/location, timing past intended landing point, etc.) prior to landing.  Overt or covert markings may be used to define a LZ.  (T-2) 5.12.6.2.  Short Field AMP-3 markings will consist of a touchdown zone marked by four IR  lights  at  the  corners  of  the  touchdown  zone.    An  IR  strobe  will  mark  the  end  of  the usable LZ surface or distance specified in  Figure  5.1.  Pilots not certified in short field operations  will  use  AMP-3  touchdown  zone  marking  distances  IAW  Paragraph 5.14.5.1.1.  (T-3) 5.12.6.2.1.  AMP-3.    The  length  of  the  touch  down  zone  in  the  “Box  and  One” configuration will be 200 feet.  The width will normally be equal to the width of the Landing  Zone.    Box  widths  may  be  less  than  landing  zone  width,  but  must  be  pre-briefed.    Minimum  touchdown  dimensions  are  30  feet  by  200  feet,  or  23  feet  wide with waiver IAW Paragraph 5.14.2.  See Figure 5.1.  (T-2) 5.12.6.3.  Operations  using  AMP-4  markings.    Aircrews  will  define  an  identifiable touchdown and go-around point, especially when runway required is the minimum length required by this instruction. AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015   29  Figure 5.1.  AMP-3 (Box and One) Configuration. Note:    Figure  depicts  AMP-3  configuration  for  short  field  qualified  pilot  operations.    Non-qualified short field pilots may use the short field box and one configuration as long as the total runway length meets the requirements of Paragraph 5.14.3.1.  (T-3) 5.13.  Aircraft  Rescue  and  Firefighting  (ARFF)  Requirements.  ARFF  requirements  at  non- United States Air Force (USAF) active flying bases are as follows:  5.13.1.  Sq/CC  or  DO  will  establish  aircraft  incident  procedures  at  local  training  airfields.  Comply  with  local  and  MAJCOM  restrictions  and  use  the  Operation  Risk  Management (ORM) process to mitigate risk.  (T-3) 5.14.  Runway  and  Taxiway  Requirements.  Use  normal  takeoff  and  landing  procedures whenever  practical.    For  mission  accomplishment,  if  approach  end  overruns  are  available  and   30  AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015 stressed  or  authorized  for  normal  operations,  the  overruns  may  be  used  to  increase  the  runway available  for  takeoff.    Base  all  aircraft  performance  requirements  on  actual  or  predicted environmental  conditions  (e.g.,  pressure  altitude,  temperature,  aircraft  weight,  runway  surface conditions, etc.). 5.14.1.  Taxiway width.  Minimum width for all operations is 18 feet (5.49m).  (T-3) 5.14.2.  Runway  width.    Minimum  width  for  all  operations  is  30  feet  (9.14m).    Squadron commander  or  Joint  Special  Operations  Aviation  Component  (JSOAC)  commander  may approve  the  use  of  runways  and  LZs  no  less  than  23  feet  (7.01m)  (200%  of  wheel  track) wide.  (T-3) 5.14.2.1.  Maximum crosswind component, steady state or gust, for takeoffs or  landings on runways or LZs less than 30 feet wide is 12 knots.  (T-2) 5.14.3.  Normal Operations: 5.14.3.1.  Takeoff  and  Landing.    The  minimum  runway  length  for  normal  takeoff  or landing is Critical Field Length (CFL) or Accelerate-Stop Distance, whichever is greater.  (T-2) 5.14.3.1.1.  Pilots  will  calculate  accelerate-stop  distance  and  CFL  for  all  missions.  (T-2) 5.14.3.1.2.  Normal  operations  where  runway  available  is  less  than  Accelerate-Stop Distance, but greater than CFL require squadron CC/DO approval.  (T-3) 5.14.3.1.3.  Where runway available allows, adjust refusal speed (Vr) to be equal to or greater than engine out minimum control speed (Vmca) (83 KIAS).  (T-2) 5.14.3.1.4.  For  operations  where  runway  available  is  less  than  accelerate-stop distance, note that V1 is  less than Vr, which will require separate  “go” and “rotate” calls by the PNF.  Adjust Vr to be greater than or equal to 83 KIAS.  (T-2) 5.14.3.2.  Touch-and-go  operations.    Minimum  runway  length  is  5,000  feet  for  all  flap settings.  (T-3) 5.14.3.3.  Stop-and-go  operations.    Available  runway  distance  remaining  after  stopping the aircraft will be at least Critical Field Length or Accelerate-Stop Distance, whichever is greater. 5.14.4.  Short Field Operations: 5.14.4.1.  Short  field  operations  are  defined  as  takeoffs  or  landings  where  runway available  is  less  than  critical  field  length.    Only  short  field  certified  pilots  or  pilots receiving formal syllabus instruction may perform short field operations.  (T-3) 5.14.4.1.1.  Operations  where  runway  available  is  less  than  CFL,  but  greater  than Minimum  Field  Length  for  Tactical  Takeoff  (MFLTTO)  require  squadron  CC/DO approval.  (T-3) 5.14.4.2.  The  minimum  runway  length  for  short  field  operations  is  1,500  feet  or MFLTTO,  whichever  is  greater.    However,  crews  must  ensure  aircraft  takeoff  and landing performance is sufficient for the given runway and environmental conditions as defined below.  Crews will decrease the fuel and/or cargo load to meet or exceed required AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015   31  performance.    The  OG/CC  or  COMAFSOF  is  the  waiver  authority  for  runways  shorter than  1,500  feet  or  MFLTTO  for  operational  missions.    For  operational  missions  with runways  shorter  than  1,500  feet  or  MFLTTO,  performance  requirements  are  IAW Paragraph 5.14.4.2.1 and 5.14.4.2.2 below.  (T-2) 5.14.4.2.1.  Takeoff.    Crews  will  adjust  aircraft  weight  to  ensure  charted  Takeoff Ground  Roll  +  10%  or  MFLTTO  whichever  is  greater  is  equal  to  or  less  than  the usable runway length.  Overruns may provide an additional safety buffer in the event of an aborted takeoff, but  crews may not include the overruns  as usable runway for takeoff.  Waivers may be requested in accordance with AFI 13-217, Paragraph 1.3.  (T-3) 5.14.4.2.2.  Landing.    Crews  will  adjust  aircraft  weight  to  ensure  charted  Landing Ground  Roll  +  200  feet  (for  the  AMP-3  box),  is  equal  to  or  less  than  the  usable runway length.  Approach end overruns may provide an additional safety buffer in the event of a short or long landing.  Crews may not include the approach end overruns as usable  runway  for  landing.    Waivers  may  be  requested  in  accordance  with  AFI  13-217, Paragraph 1.3.  (T-3) 5.14.4.3.  Crews will use the heavier weight,  either takeoff or landing, when calculating CFL,  MFLTTO,  takeoff,  and  landing  ground  roll  (e.g.,  for  a  planned  infiltration  of passengers  and/or  cargo,  crews  will  calculate  the  takeoff  ground  roll  using  the  landing weight,  not  the  planned  takeoff  weight).    Exceptions  may  be  waived  by  the  OG/CC  or COMAFSOF.  (T-2)    CAUTION:  Landing at an airfield based on landing ground roll may not provide the aircrew with the required takeoff ground roll without offloading pax, cargo, or fuel. 5.14.4.4.  Crews  will  ensure  single  engine  climb  gradient  is  sufficient  to  clear  all obstacles along the departure routing.  (T-3)        WARNING:  Aircraft performance is based  upon  rotating  and  climbing  on  criteria  outlined  in  the  POH.    Failure  to  maintain aircraft performance criteria may not allow for safe clearance of obstacles. 5.14.5.  NVG  Operations  may  be  conducted  using  normal  or  short  field  operational procedures. 5.14.5.1.  Pilots not qualified in short field operations: 5.14.5.1.1.  Night  Vision  Goggle  (NVG)  AMP-3  landings  can  be  performed  by  any pilot qualified to perform NVG landings.  AMP-3 landings will be in accordance with Paragraph 5.12.6.2.  Unless using short field procedures, runway remaining for stop-and-go  operations  will  be  in  accordance  with  Paragraph  5.14.3.3.    If  the  runway remaining is less, taxi the aircraft to achieve Critical Field Length or Accelerate-Stop Distance, whichever is greater.  (T-3) 5.14.5.1.2.  NVG AMP-4 landings can be performed by any pilot qualified to perform NVG landings.  AMP-4 landings will have a clearly defined intended point of landing and  runway  remaining  after  intended  point  of  landing.    Unless  using  short  field procedures, runway remaining for stop-and-go operations will be in accordance with Paragraph  5.14.3.3.    If  the  runway  remaining  is  less,  taxi  the  aircraft  to  achieve Critical Field Length or Accelerate-Stop Distance, whichever is greater.  (T-3)   32  AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015 5.14.5.2.  Unit commanders  will  determine  Landing  Zone  Control  Officer (LZCO)/Landing  Zone  Safety  Officer  (LZSO)  requirements  when  conducting  NVG landings at unlit or covertly marked landing zones or airfields.  (T-3) 5.14.5.2.1.  Squadron  qualified  LZSOs  may  accomplish  these  duties  IAW  AFI  13-217.  (T-3) Figure 5.2.  Short-Field Takeoff Decision Matrix.  5.14.6.  Semiprepared surface operations: 5.14.6.1.  Semiprepared  surfaces  are  defined  in  AFI  13-217,  Drop  Zone  and  Landing Zone  Procedures.    Only  semiprepared  surface  certified  pilots  or  pilots  receiving  formal syllabus instruction may perform semiprepared surface operations.  (T-3) 5.14.6.2.  Pilots  will  only  perform  stop-and-go  or  full  stop  landings  on  semiprepared surfaces.    Reference  POH  for  information  on  aircraft  performance  on  semiprepared surfaces.  (T-3) 5.14.7.  Only  NVG,  semiprepared,  short-field  qualified  pilots  or  pilots  receiving  formal syllabus  instruction  in  these  operations  may  perform  operations  to  semiprepared  surfaces using short field procedures on NVGs.

Aircraft  Taxi  Obstruction  Clearance  Criteria.  In  addition  to  the  requirements  of AFI 11218, Aircraft Operations and Movement on the Ground, comply with the following: 5.15.1.  Without  wing  walkers,  avoid  taxi  obstructions  by  at  least  25  feet.    With  wing walkers, avoid taxi obstructions by at least 10 feet.  (T-3)       Exception:  When operating at a civilian airport and taxiing on a Fixed Based Operator (FBO) ramp, the PIC may taxi the aircraft within 25 feet of obstacles or other aircraft without wing walkers when using marked taxi routes.  The PIC will comply with marshaller instructions.  Taxi routes must be used by similar  types  of  aircraft  for  which  the  routes  were  designed  and  in  specifically  designed parking  spots.    Support  equipment  shall  be  located  in  appropriately  designated  areas.    In austere  locations  where  wing  walkers  and  taxi  lines  do  not  exist  and  obstacle  distances  are questionable,  the  PIC  must  use  good  crew  coordination  and  sound  judgment  to  effectively mitigate risk to the aircraft.  (T-3) 5.15.2.  Do not taxi aircraft closer than 10 feet to any obstacle.  (T-3) 5.15.3.  When taxi clearance is doubtful, use a wing walker.  If wing walkers are unavailable or  if  provided  and  doubt  still  exists  as  to  proper  clearance,  deplane  a  crew  member  to maintain obstruction clearance.  (T-3) 5.16.  Reverse  Taxi.  CAUTION:    Using  brakes  to  stop  the  aircraft  while  reverse  taxiing  may result in aircraft empennage contacting the ground. 5.16.1.  The  pilot  performing  reverse  taxi  operations  will  coordinate  reverse  taxi  directions and  signals  to  be  used  with  the  marshaller  and  loadmaster  (if  applicable)  prior  to commencing reverse taxi operations. 5.16.1.1.  Mission requirements permitting, the cargo doors will be open prior to reverse taxi. 5.16.1.2.  The loadmaster or another crew member will be in a position to direct reverse taxi, report any hazards and provide the pilot with timely interphone instructions on turns, distance remaining, condition of the maneuvering area, and stopping point. 5.16.2.  During night reverse taxi operations, the pilot will ensure visibility in the taxi area is sufficient to conduct safe taxi operations. 5.16.3.  Stop no less than 25 feet from an obstruction even if using a wing walker.  (T-3) 5.16.4.  Secure all cargo and ensure passengers are seated prior to reverse taxi operations. 5.17.  Takeoff and Landing Obstruction Clearance Criteria: 5.17.1.  The mission directive is confirmation that the tasking agency (e.g., MC, Operations Group  or  COMAFSOF  staff,  etc.)  has  reviewed  the  airfields  of  intended  operation  for obstructions and other hazards in accordance with AF and AFSOC directives.  The mission tasking  agency  will  advise  aircrews  of  known  obstructions  and  other  factors  that  could  be hazardous  to  flight  operations.    The  PIC  will  not  make  an  approach  and  landing  into  an airfield  requiring  certification  by  the  HQ  AMC  Airfield  Suitability  and  Restriction  Report (ASRR),  unless  they  have  previously  operated  into  that  airfield  as  a  pilot  or  observer  and have  reviewed  the  airfield  certification  briefing  and  audiovisual  program  within  the  last  14 days  or  before  departing  home  station,  whichever  is  closer  to  the  date  of  intended  use.    34  AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015 Reference  AFI 11202,  Vol  3,  General  Flight  Rules,  for  information  on  ASRR  waiver authority.  (T-2) 5.17.2.  For  an  LZ  to  be  suitable  for  operations,  the  LZ  must  meet  the  requirements  in AFI 13217, Drop Zone and Landing Procedures, and the AFSOC Supplement.  (T-2) 5.17.3.  Reference  AFI  13-217,  Drop  Zone  and  Landing  Zone  Procedures,  for  additional information on LZ criteria for shoulders, graded areas, transitional area, clear and approach zones. 5.18.  Operations Over Arresting Cables. 5.18.1.  Avoid landing on non-recessed arresting cables. 5.18.2.  Avoid rolling over  arresting cables at high  speed during taxi,  takeoff, or landing to preclude damage to bottom of aircraft.  Maintain appropriate backpressure on aircraft yoke to reduce  nose  landing  gear  down  force  if  maintaining  a  high  speed  during  taxi,  takeoff,  or landing over a raised arresting cable. 5.19.  Aircraft Recovery from Unprepared Surfaces.  Aircrews should not attempt to recover an aircraft after inadvertent entry onto surfaces that are not suitable for taxi.  Ground crews using appropriate  equipment  will  normally  recover  the  aircraft.    Aircrews  may  recover  the  aircraft  at austere locations if, after thorough inspection, the PIC is sure there is no aircraft damage and the surface will support the aircraft.  (T-2) 5.20.  Inter.  Normally,  initiate  takeoffs  from  the  beginning  of  the  runway.    The  decision  to make  intersection  takeoffs  rests  solely  with  the  aircraft  commander.    Base  TOLD  card computations on the runway remaining from where the takeoff is initiated. 5.21.  Reduced  Power  Operations.  To  extend  engine  life,  use  reduced  power  procedures  as much  as  possible  during  normal  operations.    During  training  when  multiple  touch-and-go operations are being performed, reduce takeoff as directed by the POH. 5.22.  Engines Running Onload or Offload (ERO). 5.22.1.  EROs  will  be  accomplished  IAW  the  C-145A  Engine  Running  Onload/Offload  or INFIL/EXFIL  Checklist.    Aircrews  will  only  utilize  the  aft  cargo  doors  during  ERO operations. 5.22.2.  General Procedures: 5.22.2.1.  The PIC will brief crew members on the intended ERO operation, emphasizing specific crew member duties. 5.22.2.2.  If applicable, cargo doors may be opened prior to parking to prepare for cargo offload  or  onload,  provided  all  equipment,  cargo,  and  passengers  remain  secured  in  the cargo compartment. 5.22.2.3.  The  parking  brake  will  normally  be  set  and  one  pilot  will  monitor  brakes, interphone, and primary ground communications radio. 5.22.2.4.  Operate  engines  in  ground  idle  power  and  condition  lever  settings.    If conditions  warrant,  lower  flaps  to  reduce  prop  blast  aft  of  the  aircraft.    Consider feathering the propellers for the ERO.          Note:  Monitor engine oil temperature when props are feathered. AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015   35  5.22.2.5.  Aircraft commanders should consider using any overt lighting that would assist the ERO and enhance safety. 5.22.2.6.  Update passenger  and cargo manifests, crew lists, and weight  and balance  for the subsequent sortie if passengers or cargo are onloaded or offloaded. 5.22.2.7.  After  the  aircraft  is  slowed  to  taxi  speed,  the  crew  may  remove  all  tie-downs except  one  forward  and  one  aft  restraint.    Remove  remaining  restraints  only  after  the aircraft is stopped. 5.22.2.8.  When  available,  the  loadmaster  will  direct  all  onloading  or  offloading operations  using  pre-briefed  signals.    Other  qualified  crew  members  may  assist  the operation; however, the PIC or loadmaster retains overall responsibility for the operation. 5.22.2.9.  Passengers will be escorted by a crew member, if available, when enplaning or deplaning. 5.22.2.10.  Resume  taxi  when  all  crew  members  have  verbally  acknowledged  that  the aircraft is ready for taxi.   36  AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015 Chapter 6 GENERAL OPERATING PROCEDURES Section 6A—Pre-mission 6.1.

If other aircraft, vehicles or personnel  are operating in the area, attempt to determine their effect  on  the  LZ,  taxi  routes,  or  aircraft  parking  area.    Brief  any  other  special considerations  such  as  parking  locations,  on/offload  procedures,  fueling  locations, equipment and procedures, etc. 6.12.2.7.  Aircraft  commanders  are  responsible  for  notifying  squadron  leadership  on planned mission/training profiles IAW squadron policies. 6.12.3.  Passenger Briefings. 6.12.3.1.  Prior to each flight, the PIC will ensure that all passengers are briefed.  When more  than  one  flight  is  accomplished  by  the  same  crew  and  passengers,  subsequent briefings are not required, except to brief route information, mission changes, etc.  When additional passengers are added, brief them completely. 6.12.3.2.  The  passenger  briefing  will  include  demonstration  of  seat  belt,  emergency oxygen and fire extinguishing systems, and locations of emergency exits.  All overwater flights will include a briefing on personal and aircraft life support equipment. 6.13.  Flight Crew Information File (FCIF).  Review Volume I, Part A, of the FCIF before all missions. 6.13.1.  Update  FCIF  Currency  Record  and  Squadron  read  file,  if  new  material  has  been added to the FCIF since the last review.  Legibly enter the last FCIF item number, the current date,  and  initial  the  FCIF  Currency  Record  or  complete  required  electronic  review procedures if FCIF is stored electronically (e.g.  Patriot Excalibur).  When unable to sign the FCIF  Currency  Record  or  complete  electronic  FCIF  review  procedures,  initialing  and numbering the latest FCIF by an individual’s name on the flight authorization order certifies the  FCIF  Currency  review  of  all  items  are  complete.    During  deployed  operations  or contingencies, mission planning crews will maintain hard copy of home station or MAJCOM FCIFs for aircrew review.  (T-3) 6.13.2.  PIC  will  ensure  any  crew  members  joining  a  mission  en  route  receive  an  FCIF update.  Instructor pilots who fly with senior officers are responsible for briefing FCIF items.  (T-3) 6.13.3.  Crew members not assigned or attached to the squadron will certify FCIF review by entering  the  last  FCIF  number  and  their  initials  next  to  their  name  on  the  file  copy  of  the flight authorization orders.  (T-3) 6.14.  Flight  Planning  Systems.  The  primary  flight/mission  planning  system  is  the  Special Operations  Forces  Planning  and  Rehearsal  System  (SOFPARS).    SOFPARS  is  a  subset  of  the Air Force Mission Support System (AFMSS) that includes the Portable Flight Planning Software (PFPS) and the Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS).  Upgraded or new versions of SOFPARS   42  AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015 and JMPS will be released and authorized by the HQ AFSOC/A3 for use after applicable testing has been completed. 6.14.1.  Electronic Data Transfer.  If the flight planning computer transfers a flight plan to the aircraft  electronically,  it  must  be  an  AFSOC  approved  system.    HQ  AFSOC/A3  will periodically  publish  a  listing  of  approved  systems.    Aircrews  will  not  use  unapproved versions of any system to load aircraft avionics without approval.  (T-3) 6.15.  Coordinates.  The  following  procedures  will  be  used:        Note:    Aircrew  will  confirm  a common  datum  with  their  mission  users  during  the  mission  planning  process.    Failure  to  plan navigation  to  LZ,  DZ,  or  mission  areas  using  a  common  datum  may  result  in  errors  of  up  to several  miles.    Computer  based  mission  planning  systems  and  aircraft  navigational  systems generally  use  WGS84  as  reference  datum.    Attempt  to  use  WGS84  whenever  possible  to minimize confusion. 6.15.1.  When reporting or receiving positions using coordinates derived from maps, charts, or related cartographic products, a complete reference to the source of the coordinates will be provided.  This reference will include the datum map or chart producer, series, sheet number, edition and date. 6.15.2.  When  reporting  or  receiving  positions  using  coordinates  derived  from  non-cartographic  sources  such  as  GPS  receivers,  Analytical  Photogrammetric  Positioning Systems  (APPS),  or  related  systems,  a  complete  reference  to  the  source  of  the  coordinates will  be  provided.    This  reference  will  include  the  datum,  method  used  to  derive  the coordinates, agency producing the coordinates, and accuracy of the coordinates. 6.16.  Flight Logs.  Prepare a flight log for each off-station mission and include the following as a  minimum:    turn  points,  headings,  distances,  estimated  time  en  route  (ETE),  minimum  safe altitude (MSA), and fuel computations.  A flight log is not required if the above information is included on a flight map.  (T-3) 6.16.1.  A  flight  log  is  not  required  for  local  training  flights  or  when  mission  requirements are unknown such as during an alert status.  Aircrews are still responsible for complying with fuel requirements outlined in AFI 11-202, Vol 3, and this instruction.  (T-3) 6.17.  Weather  Planning.  Comply with AFI 11-202, Vol 3, weather minimums unless local or theater specific weather minimums are more restrictive.  (T-3) 6.18.  Lunar  Illumination.  Any  training  or  operational  missions  planned  when  the  lunar illumination  is  forecast  to  be  less  than  10%  during  the  mission  will  require  notification  of  the squadron commander, DO, or designated official. 6.19.  Fuel  Planning.  Use  criteria  outlined  in  AFI  11-202,  Vol  3.    Aircrews  will  conduct appropriate in-flight planning to ensure proper fuel management.  Reference  Attachment  2 for ETP discussion and calculations.  (T-3) 6.19.1.  Plan to arrive at destination or alternate (if required) with: 6.19.1.1.  400 pounds of fuel remaining during day Visual Flight Rules (VFR) conditions. 6.19.1.2.  550  pounds  of  fuel  remaining  during  night  or  Instrument  Flight  Rules conditions. 6.19.1.3.  When two alternates are required, flight plan to the most distant alternate. AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015   43  6.19.2.  Land with no less than 300 pounds of fuel on board. 6.19.3.  Plan to consume 150 pounds of fuel per instrument approach to be flown. 6.19.4.  Plan  an  additional  15  minutes  of  fuel  per  hour  at  a  maximum  cruise  power  fuel consumption  rate  for  that  portion  of  the  flight  where  structural  icing  or  thunderstorms requiring off-course maneuvering are forecast or reported. 6.19.5.  Cruise at the altitude that gives the best  ground distance traveled for each pound of fuel consumed.  As a rule of thumb, climb if ground speed is reduced less than 5 knots for each 1,000 feet of altitude increase.  Descend if ground speed will increase more than 5 knots for each 1,000 feet of altitude decrease. 6.19.6.  Pilots will plan fuel consumption rates IAW C-145A  POH power settings.  Plan to fly  transition  legs  at  Long  Range  Cruise  power  settings  in  an  effort  to  conserve  fuel.    If maximum cruise power setting is to be used for mission accomplishment, pilots will plan fuel consumption rates at this power setting. 6.20.  Objective Area Planning. 6.20.1.  Map  Selection.    Maps  with  a  scale  of  1:500,000  or  greater  detail  are  required  for objective area operations.  Maps with a scale of 1:250,000 or greater are highly desired.  (T-3) 6.20.2.  Pilots  will  ensure  all  maps  used  for  flight  have  the  most  current  hazards  posted.  Aircrew will also ensure appropriate civil airspace is annotated along their route of flight. 6.20.3.  Emergency  Safe  Altitude  (ESA).    An  ESA  is  an  altitude  that  will  provide  positive terrain  clearance should  Instrument  Meteorological  Conditions  (IMC) be  encountered.  Use 1,000  feet  (2,000  feet  in  mountainous  terrain)  above  the  highest  obstacle  or  terrain  feature within  10  nm  of  the  intended  flight  path/objective  area.    An  ESA  will  be  computed  for  all objective areas.         Note:  Mountainous areas are defined as having a 500 foot change in surface  altitude  over  ½  nm.    For  operations  outside  of  the  CONUS,  reference  AFI  11-202, Vol 3. 6.20.4.  Minimum Safe Altitude.  An MSA is an altitude that provides Visual Meteorological Conditions  (VMC)  terrain  clearance  and  limited  threat  avoidance  during  degraded  aircrew situational awareness or periods of task saturation.  Use 500 feet above the highest obstacle or  terrain  feature  within  3  nm  of  the  intended  flight  path/objective  area.    An  MSA  will  be computed for all objective areas.  (T-3)          WARNING:   Failure to maintain an  accurate altimeter setting during flight may cause lower than planned terrain clearances or impact with terrain when using the computed ESA/MSA. 6.21.  Flight  Plans.  Use  a  DD  Form  175,  Military  Flight  Plan,  or  DD  Form  1801,  DoD International Flight Plan for VFR flights terminating at the base of departure.  Aircrews may file with the FAA using the standard FAA flight plan when departing from a location where military support  is  unavailable.    If  aircrews  file  with  the  FAA  and  their  destination  is  a  military installation,  aircrews  must  notify  the  destination  base  operations  prior  to  departure  or  once airborne, via the appropriate FAA Flight Service Station, of the planned time of arrival.  (T-3) 6.22.  Aircraft Performance.   44  AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015 6.22.1.  Weight  and Balance.   Weight and balance will be computed using the POH charts, equivalent  electronic  program,  or  vector  template.    A  copy  of  each  mission‘s  weight  and balance  will  be  maintained  at  the  squadron  or  operations  center  (as  applicable)  and  carried with the aircrew.  For en route stops, weight and balance need not be recomputed provided the zero fuel  weight has not changed.  The crew will compute in-flight  crew and passenger equipment  movement  to  ensure  center  of  gravity  (CG)  limits  are  not  exceeded.    These computations  will  be  briefed  during  the  crew  or  mission  brief  or  during  flight,  as  required.  (T-3) 6.22.2.  TOLD.    Compute  TOLD  using  the  POH  performance  data  charts  or  approved tabulated data.  Compute TOLD for initial takeoff prior to engine start.  Recompute data for pressure altitude changes of 500 feet, temperature changes of 5° Celsius (C), or gross weight changes of 500 lbs.  (T-3) 6.22.3.  Computed Engine Out Service Ceiling.  The computed engine out service ceiling will not  be  below  the  published  Minimum  Obstruction  Clearance  Altitude  (MOCA)  on  IFR flights or planned VFR cruising altitude unless both of the following requirements are met: 6.22.3.1.  The forecast weather for each critical route segment, as defined in  Paragraph 6.22.3, is day VMC allowing a VFR descent to a safe VFR altitude during an emergency. 6.22.3.2.  Crews  have  planned  emergency  routes  to  emergency  airfields  on  VFR  charts (1:500,000 or larger) for the critical route segments. Section 6C—Preflight 6.23.  Aircraft Maintenance Forms. 6.23.1.  Review  the  aircraft  maintenance  forms  before  applying  power  to  the  aircraft  or operating aircraft systems. 6.23.2.  Ensure  that  the  USAF  fuel  card  and/or  other  authorized  method  of  payment  are  on board the aircraft.  The Air Card is used to pay for services such as aviation fuel, aircraft oil and  fluids,  minor  maintenance  items,  landing  fees,  aircraft  de-icing,  follow-me  trucks  and other  airfield  related  services  at  commercial  FBO  locations.    The  PIC  is  responsible  for ensuring the receipt is correct and all appropriate signatures are obtained before departing the military base, airport, or FBO.  The PIC is  responsible for turning in  all service  receipts to maintenance upon return to home station.  If services do not generate a receipt, the PIC will ensure the location and services performed are noted and relayed to maintenance.  (T-3) 6.23.3.  The  aircraft  preflight  or  exceptional  release  (if  applicable)  must  be  signed  before flight.    A  maintenance  officer,  maintenance  superintendent,  or  authorized  contract  civilian will sign the preflight or exceptional release.  However, it may be signed by the PIC if one of these individuals is not available.  (T-3) 6.23.4.  Ensure that aircraft locking keys are in aircraft maintenance forms prior to takeoff. 6.23.5.  Ensure the aircraft protective covers are on board aircraft prior to flight. 6.24.  Aircraft Inspections. 6.24.1.  Aircraft  inspection  should  normally  be  accomplished  by  the  PIC  or  person designated by the PIC.  (T-3) AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015   45  6.24.2.  Face-to-face turnovers between crew members are acceptable. 6.24.3.  Any  qualified  aircrew  may  accomplish  the  preflight  inspection  and  brief  the oncoming aircrew.  (T-3) 6.24.4.  Required  Equipment.    The  final  responsibility  regarding  equipment  required  for  a mission  rests  with  the  PIC.    If  one  PIC  accepts  an  aircraft  to  operate  a  mission  or  mission segment without an item or system, this acceptance does not commit that PIC, or a different PIC, to subsequent operations with the same item or system inoperative.  If the PIC elects to operate with degraded equipment or aircraft systems, coordinate mission requirements prior to  flight  with  the  mission  control  agency  to  ensure  the  decision  does  not  adversely  impact follow-on missions.  (T-3) 6.24.5.  Required  Forms.    Aircraft  will  contain  an  appropriate  and  current  airworthiness certificate, effective registration certificate, Radio Station Permit for overseas missions, and appropriate  Weight  and  Balance  information.    The  PIC  will  also  ensure  one  engine inoperative  procedures,  climb  and  en  route  performance  data  is  accessible  during  flight operations. 6.25.  Alert  Aircraft  Procedures.  To  accept  an  aircraft  on  alert,  complete  a  normal  aircraft preflight.    After  72  hours  on  alert,  allow  maintenance  personnel  access  to  inspect  the  aircraft.  (T-3) 6.25.1.  Parking.  Park the alert aircraft in a designated alert parking area to expedite taxi and takeoff. 6.25.2.  Climatic  Protective  Facilities.    During  periods  of  extreme  cold,  hot,  or  severe weather,  every  effort  should  be  made  to  shelter  alert  aircraft  and  essential  equipment  in  a hangar to ensure operational readiness in the event of a mission. 6.25.3.  Flying Alert Aircraft.  The alert aircraft may be flown for purposes other than actual alert missions provided the following conditions are complied with (T-3): 6.25.3.1.  Ensure sufficient fuel remains on board to meet mission requirements.  If not, upon flight completion, refuel the aircraft to required alert fuel quantity. 6.25.3.2.  Communication contact is maintained with the primary controlling agencies. 6.25.3.3.  A qualified (for the alert mission) aircrew is on board. 6.25.3.4.  Controlling  agencies  are  notified  any  time  the  alert  aircraft  departs  the  local area. 6.25.4.  Once  accepted  for  alert,  the  alert  aircrew  will  make  an  entry  in  the  aircraft maintenance  forms,  stating,  “Aircraft  accepted  on  alert  at  (local  time  and  date)”.    No maintenance  may  be  performed  on  it  without  prior  approval  of  the  alert  crew  PIC  and notification  of  the  squadron  DO  or  deployed  MC.    To  ensure  integrity  of  the  aircrew preflight,  an  alert  crew  member  must  be  present  whenever  maintenance  is  performed,  or  at the  completion  of  the  maintenance,  the  aircrew  is  required  to  check  the  area  in  which maintenance  was performed.  The check should  be performed as soon  as practical  after the maintenance and must be performed prior to flight.  (T-3) 6.26.  Aircraft Servicing and Ground Operations.   46  AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015 6.26.1.  Aircraft Refueling.  Qualified aircrew may refuel, add engine oil, and hydraulic fluid if needed, at locations without maintenance support.  At military bases, coordinate with local base operations representatives on procedures for servicing the aircraft while the aircrew is not present.  (T-3) 6.26.2.  Aircrew/Maintenance Engine Runs.  Mixed aircrew/maintenance engine runs should not normally be accomplished.  If conducted, the appropriate POH or maintenance inspection procedures will be used.  (T-3) 6.27.  Life Support and Oxygen Requirements. 6.27.1.  The PIC or designated representative will ensure sufficient quantities of appropriate serviceable life support, survival equipment, and protective clothing for the entire mission are aboard the aircraft.  Verify Air Force Technical Order (AFTO) Form 46, Prepositioned Life Support Equipment, prior to each flight.  Life support equipment and medical kits weighing less than 200 pounds may be secured with seat belts.  (T-3) 6.27.2.  On  all  overwater  flights  when  route  of  flight  is  beyond  power-off  gliding  distance from land, life preserver units (LPUs) will be sized and immediately available at the aircrew member‘s duty station while flying overwater.  Passengers will have life preservers available and will be worn at the discretion of the PIC.  Life rafts will be available to accommodate all personnel  on  board.    Life  rafts  and  life  preservers  are  not  required  when  overwater  flight occurs during instrument approach procedures under ATC control, immediately after takeoff, and before landing.  (T-3) 6.27.3.  Anti-exposure  suits  for  the  aircrew  and  passengers  will  be  on  board  during  any preplanned overwater flights which are beyond power-off gliding distance from land and the water temperature is 60° Fahrenheit (F) (16°C) or less.  (T-3) 6.27.4.  Oxygen  requirements  are  outlined  in  AFI  11-202,  Vol  3.    On  missions  with passengers,  carry  passenger  oxygen  systems  (POS)  (e.g.,  Passenger  Oxygen  Kit  (POK), Emergency Portable Oxygen System (EPOS), or other approved system) if flight is planned above 13,000 feet.  (T-3) 6.27.4.1.  The  loadmaster  and  any  other  personnel  required  to  be  mobile  in  the  cargo compartment  will  wear  helmets  during  airdrop  operations  when  static  lines  are attached.(T-3). 6.27.5.  Eye Protection.  LMs  will  wear eye protection anytime the cargo doors are open in flight..  (T-3)   Personnel not involved with airdrop operations do not require eye protection. 6.27.6.  Restraining Harness.  Crew members will wear a restraining harness when near open doors,  or hatches in-flight.  (T-3) 6.28.  In-Flight  Meals.  The  pilots  will  not  consume  in-flight  meals  within  1½  hours  of  each other  during  flight  if  the  meals  were  procured  from  the  same  source  and  consist  of  the  same menu.  (T-3) 6.29.  Cockpit Congestion and Loose Objects. 6.29.1.  The flight deck area will be kept as uncluttered and orderly as possible for all flight and ground operations.  Specifically: AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015   47  6.29.1.1.  During  engine  start  and  ground  operations,  no  items  (checklist,  charts,  etc.) should  be  placed  in  a  position  that  would  prevent  inspection  of  aircraft  and  engine instruments or switches. 6.29.1.2.  During flight, no items (checklists, charts, etc.) will be placed in a position that covers or hides any flight or engine instruments from the view of the PF. 6.29.1.3.  Publication kits, flight kits, and personal kits will not be placed where they may interfere with the flight controls or egress. Section 6D—Departure 6.30.  Departure Briefings and Procedures.  Before initial takeoff, the PF will brief the aircrew on the procedures to be followed during takeoff and departure, performance data, and intentions in case of an emergency.  (T-3) 6.30.1.  Any  crew  member  noting  a  safety  of  flight  malfunction  before  rotate,  refusal,  or decision  speed  will  state,  “REJECT”  and  give  a  brief  description  of  the  malfunction.    The PIC will brief abort criteria prior to takeoff roll if not accomplished in the pre-brief. 6.31.  On  Time  Takeoffs.  Mission departures are considered on time if the aircraft is  airborne no  later  than  15  minutes  after  the  scheduled  takeoff  time.    Early  departures  are  authorized provided local,  down-range and  aircrew impact  are  evaluated and no adverse  effect  will result.  (T-3) 6.32.  Aircraft  Control.  At  no  time  will  two  unqualified  pilots  be  at  the  controls  at  the  same time. 6.33.  Transponder/Aircraft  Identification.  Aircraft  will  not  depart  with  an  inoperative transponder.    Exception:    Aircraft  may  takeoff  if  the  transponder  was  operational  on  the previous  leg.    If  the  transponder  is  inoperative  and  no  repair  capability  exits,  the  aircraft  may takeoff  if  ATC  approves  the  flight.    Mission  requirements  will  dictate  the  use  of  Identification Friend  or  Foe  (IFF)  and  aircraft  commanders  should  comply  with  the  appropriate  OPORD  or communication plan (COMPLAN).  Refer to the MMEL for other restrictions.  (T-3) Section 6E—En Route 6.34.  En Route Briefings  and Procedures.  Conduct in-flight briefings, as necessary, to cover any  unusual  circumstances  and  when  flight  safety  or  other  conditions  require  the  nonstandard accomplishment of any maneuver.  (T-3) 6.35.  Flight Progress.  Use available NAVAIDS to maintain course centerline and a positive fix on the aircraft‘s position.  When conducting navigation using  a GPS for  primary navigation or autopilot  flight  coupling,  the  pilots  will  also  use  appropriate  navigation  aids  (e.g.,  VHF Omnidirectional Range [VOR]) to maintain a positive fix on the aircraft’s position.  (T-3) 6.36.  Crew Duties and Responsibilities. 6.36.1.  Change  of  Aircraft  Control.    The  change  of  aircraft  or  flight  controls  will  be accomplished  using  a  positive  change  of  controls.    Use  the  statement  “Pilot/Copilot  has controls” to transfer control.  The other pilot will acknowledge the change of aircraft control by stating “Pilot/Copilot has controls.”   48  AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015 6.36.2.  The PNF should be the primary crew member responsible for executing emergency checklist  procedures.    Normally,  the  PF  will  manipulate  the  power  lever,  condition  lever, and/or  manual  override  lever.    The  PF  maintains  aircraft  control  and  reacts  appropriately.  The PF will confirm any switches prior to being actuated and will reference the checklist for guidance during the emergency.  The PNF should review the POH as appropriate and as time permits. 6.36.3.  Interphone Communications.  In the terminal area or during critical phases of flight, limit interphone conversations to those essential for crew coordination.  During other phases of  flight,  do  not  allow  interphone  conversations  to  interfere  with  the  safe  conduct  of  the flight,  effective  Crew  Resource  Management  (CRM),  or  communication  with  outside agencies.  In all cases, the PIC is responsible for determining when interphone conversations are  appropriate.    Do  not  discuss  classified  information  on  interphone  during  radio transmissions.  (T-3) 6.36.4.  All  crew members will monitor aircraft interphone.  Clearance is required from the PIC prior to an aircrew member removing headset.  The aircrew member will advise the PIC when they have resumed monitoring the aircraft interphone.  (T-3) 6.36.5.  Command  or  Mission  Radios.    Normally,  the  PF  should  use  and  monitor  only  one ATC  radio  plus  GUARD.    Monitoring  two  ATC  controlling  agency‘s  transmissions simultaneously  is  not  recommended.    This  does  not  preclude  establishing  contact  or conducting a radio check on another frequency. 6.36.6.  The  PIC  or  designated  aircrew  member  operating  the  command  or  mission  radios will  inform  the  crew  which  radio  is  primary.    All  crew  members  will  monitor  the  primary command radio unless specifically directed otherwise by the PIC. 6.36.7.  Record  and  read  back  all  ATC  clearances  except  when  ATC  instructions  require immediate execution and read back would interfere with the timely performance of aircrew duties. 6.36.8.  During emergencies, monitor simultaneous ultrahigh frequency (UHF) and very high frequency  (VHF)  transmissions,  if  able,  when  operating  in  a  terminal  area  under  radar control. 6.37.  Radar Advisories.  Participate to the maximum extent possible while operating in VFR or simulated IFR conditions.  (T-3) 6.38.  Communication Instructions for Reporting Vital Intelligence Sightings (CIRVIS) and Other  Reports.  Refer  to  AFI  10-206,  Operational  Reporting.    Report  all  vital  intelligence sightings from aircraft as indicated in FLIP Planning or FIH. 6.38.1.  In-flight  harassment  or  hostile  action  against  aircraft.    Aircraft  subjected  to harassment  or  hostile  action  by  foreign  aircraft  will  immediately  contact  the  nearest  USAF air-to-ground  voice  facility  and  report  the  encounter.    Include  aircraft  nationality,  type, insignia, or any other identifying features; note position, heading, time, speed when harassed, and  type  of  harassment.    Request  a  relay  of  the  report  to  the  nearest  C2  agency.    Also, attempt to contact the nearest command post when in UHF and VHF range. 6.38.2.  Other  incidents  will  be  reported  as  indicated  in  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff  (JCS) Publication 60, Joint Communication System and AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting. AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015   49  6.39.  In-Flight Emergency (IFE) Procedures.  Report deviations from directives that occur as a result of an emergency IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 3, and this instruction.  (T-3) 6.39.1.  Notification  of  Controlling  Agencies.    As  soon  as  practical  after  completing  the aircraft  emergency  procedure  checklist  or  critical  action  procedures,  furnish  the  controlling agency  a  description  and  extent  of  the  difficulty,  assistance  required,  intentions,  and  any further pertinent information.  (T-3) 6.39.2.  Turnaround  Procedures.    When  a  turnaround  is  necessary,  use  procedures  in  FLIP.  Maintain VFR, reverse course, climb or descend to a VFR altitude or flight level and request ATC  clearance.    If  unable  to  maintain  VFR,  obtain  an  ATC  clearance  before  reversing course.  A turnaround under IFR conditions, without ATC approval, will be made only after a thorough evaluation of the seriousness of the emergency, general traffic density, and known traffic operating in the immediate area.  Normally, a climb or descent (with minimum change in altitude) to a VFR altitude or flight level will result in minimum exposure to other aircraft, if a turnaround is required. 6.39.3.  Need for Medical Assistance.  When a person on board the aircraft requires medical care,  the  PIC  will  inform  the  station  of  next  intended  landing  in  sufficient  time  so  medical personnel  may  meet  the  aircraft.    The  request  will  include  the  individual’s  gender, approximate age, and the nature of the medical problem. Section 6F—Arrival 6.40.  Approach  Lighting  System  (ALS)  Inoperative.  Increase  the  published  visibility minimums  of  an  instrument  approach  by  stated  criteria  in  NOTAMs,  Automatic  Terminal Information  System  (ATIS)  information,  or  as  depicted  on  the  approach  procedure,  when  the runway ALS is inoperative.  This applies only to the ALS itself, not other lights which are not a component of the ALS (e.g., Visual Approach Slope Indicator (VASI), Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI).  If no other guidance is provided, increase the published visibility by 1/2 mile.  (T-3) 6.41.  Arrival.  Before  starting  each  approach,  the  PF  will  brief  the  procedures  to  be  followed during approach, landing, and go-around/missed approach, as necessary.  Performance data will be reviewed. 6.41.1.  Minimum Fuel is 400 pounds and Emergency Fuel is 300 pounds.  Pilots will declare “Minimum Fuel” or “Emergency Fuel” to Air Traffic Control when they expect to land with less  than  the  respective  value  and  the  pilot  has  not  been  given  an  approach  or  landing clearance.  (T-3) 6.42.  Radar Altimeter Procedures. 6.42.1.  During VFR operations, the recommended low-altitude warning setting is 90 percent of intended or flown cruise altitude. 6.42.2.  For  instrument  approaches,  set  the  radar  altimeter  low-altitude  warning  to  the appropriate height  above touchdown (HAT) or height  above  aerodrome  (HAA) prior to  the final approach fix (FAF).  (T-3) 6.43.  Holding  Exception  for  Remote  or  Island  Destinations.  IAW  AFI  11-202,  Vol  3, aircrew  are  authorized  to  hold  for  one  hour  in  lieu  of  an  alternate  for  remote  or  island   50  AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015 destinations.  Aircrew will comply with additional requirements listed in AFI 11-202, Vol 3.  (T-2) 6.44.  Instrument Approach Procedures. 6.44.1.  Weather  Below  Minimums.    If  the  reported  ceiling  is  below  the  minimum  for  the approach, but the visibility value is at or above the authorized minimums before initiating an en route descent and approach, ensure fuel remaining is sufficient to accomplish the en route descent and approach, missed approach, and flight to alternate with appropriate reserves. 6.44.2.  Circling Minimums.  The C-145A is considered a Category B aircraft.  The PF may fly circling approaches at higher speeds raising the circling minimums to the category for the speed  to  be  flown.    The  PF  is  responsible  for  briefing  speeds  and  flying  the  approach according to the correct minimums. Section 6G—After Landing 6.45.  Maintenance.  Complete aircraft maintenance forms after each flight.  (T-3) 6.45.1.  Immediately  after  arrival,  the  PIC  and  any  aircrew  member  documenting  a maintenance discrepancy will debrief maintenance personnel on the status of the aircraft and subsystems.  The PIC or aircrew member noting a discrepancy will document the problem in the  aircraft  maintenance  forms.    At  locations  where  there  is  no  maintenance  personnel  and maintenance  support  is  required,  the  PIC  will  ensure  a  thorough  debrief  is  provided  to  the MC or command post prior to entering crew rest.  (T-3) 6.46.  Impoundment.  If an aircraft is involved in a ground or in-flight incident, the PIC should impound  the  aircraft  immediately  and  contact  the  squadron  CC,  DO,  MC  or  appropriate controlling agency for further instructions.  (T-3) 6.47.  Clearwater  Rinse  Facility  (Birdbath).  Aircrews  will  notify  maintenance  anytime  the aircraft is flown below 1,000 AGL overwater for extended periods of time, not including takeoffs and landings.   For airfields  that have birdbath  facilities, consult  with  maintenance prior to  use.  (T-3) 6.48.  Customs, Immigration, and Agriculture Inspections. 6.48.1.  Complete customs, agriculture, and public health clearance forms, as required, prior to opening any doors other than the crew door or enplaning and deplaning personnel. 6.48.2.  Proceed directly from the aircraft to customs, immigration, or agricultural inspection for processing at those stations where federal or local inspections are required.  The PIC or designated representative should complete the necessary forms before reporting to inspectors. 6.48.3.  After  clearing  with  border  clearance  agencies,  the  PIC  or  designated  representative will return to the aircraft for offloading and other post-flight procedures. 6.48.4.  A US military aircraft is a sovereign instrument.  When cleared to over-fly or land in foreign  territory,  it  is  US  policy  to  assert  that  military  aircraft  are  entitled  to  the  privileges and immunities which customarily are accorded warships.  These privileges and immunities include,  in  the  absence  of  stipulations  to  the  contrary,  exemption  from  duties  and  taxation; immunity  from  search,  seizure,  and  inspections  (including  customs  and  safety  inspections); or other exercise of jurisdiction by the host nation over the aircraft, personnel, equipment, or AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015   51  cargo on board.  The PIC will not authorize search, seizure, inspection, or similar exercises of jurisdiction enumerated above by foreign authorities except by direction of HQ USAF or the American Embassy in the country concerned (T-0). 6.48.5.  PIC  will  not  permit  the  inspection  of  their  aircraft  by  officials  of  any  foreign government.  If requested to do so, the PIC and crew will deny access and seek aid from the senior AFSOC or USAF representative or US Embassy or consulate within the host nation.  Inform  customs  or  other  officials  of  the  above  policy  and  request  that  they  confirm  their request through their own government and with US Department of State representatives.  If necessary,  the  aircrew  will  seal  the  aircraft  and  enter  into  crew  rest,  and  relay  departure intentions,  until  resolution  of  the  matter  by  appropriate  authority.    Use  communications  by the  fastest  means  available  to  inform  command  and  control  facilities  should  this  situation occur (T-0). 6.48.6.  When  confronted  with  a  search  request  by  foreign  authorities,  aircrews  should consider the following procedures (T-0): 6.48.6.1.  In most cases, search attempts may be stopped by a statement of the PIC to the foreign officials that the aircraft is  a sovereign instrument not  subject  to search without consent of HQ USAF or the chief of mission in the country concerned.  This should be clearly  conveyed  in  a  polite  manner  so  as  not  to  offend  foreign  authorities  that  may honestly, but mistakenly, believe they have authority to search USAF aircraft. 6.48.6.2.  If  foreign  authorities  insist  on  conducting  a  search,  the  PIC  must  negotiate  to delay the search until contact is made with AF/A3OOA or the appropriate embassy (US or  other  friendly  nation).    The  PIC  should  unequivocally  state,  the  aircrew  has  no authority  to  consent  to  the  search  and  that  they  must  relay  the  foreign  request  to  these agencies for decision.  The PIC should then notify these agencies of the foreign request by the most expeditious means available.  Thereafter, the PIC should follow instructions provided by the appropriate embassy and HQ USAF. 6.48.6.3.  If  foreign  officials  refuse  to  desist  in  their  search  request,  the  PIC  should indicate that they would prefer to fly the aircraft elsewhere (provided fuel and mechanical considerations permit a safe departure) and request permission for immediate departure. 6.48.6.4.  If permission  is  refused and the  foreign authorities insist  on forcing their way on  board  an  aircraft,  the  PIC  should  state  that  he  protests  the  course  of  action  being pursued and that he intends to notify both HQ USAF and the US Embassy of the foreign action.    The  PIC  should  then  allow  the  foreign  agents  on  board  the  aircraft,  without physical resistance, and thereafter report the incident to HQ USAF and the US Embassy as soon as possible. 6.48.7.  In  all  instances,  specific  instructions  may  be  briefed  because  of  sensitive  cargo  or equipment.    These  instructions  and  applicable  provisions  of  classified  supplements  to  the foreign clearance guide should be followed where applicable. 6.49.  Crew Debriefing/Post-Mission Actions. 6.49.1.  Training Missions.  The PIC is responsible for the mission debrief and completion of the appropriate documentation.  The PIC will ensure all applicable information is passed to controlling agencies.  (T-3)   52  AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015 6.49.2.  Combat Operations.  Each aircrew participating in combat operations will participate in a mission and intelligence debrief.  (T-3) 6.49.3.  The  squadron  CC  or  MC  will  ensure  that  all  aircrews  are  debriefed  immediately following any mission during which any enemy tactics or procedures were observed that may affect other operations. 6.49.4.  Aircrew  encountering  hostile  fire  will  immediately  notify  the  controlling  agency followed by a hostile fire incident report to intelligence immediately after landing.  (T-3) 6.49.5.  Other Missions.  The PIC has the responsibility of affording each crew member the opportunity  to  discuss  unusual  aspects  of  the  mission.    Debriefings  may  be  formal  or informal, as the situation requires. 6.49.6.  When transiting installations, the PIC will establish a point of contact with the base operations or FBO for overnight billeting.  The PIC will be immediately notified in the case of incident or emergency affecting the safety or security of the aircraft. Section 6H—Miscellaneous 6.50.  Electronic Devices.  The use of electronic devices is specified in AFI 11-202, Vol 3.  For electronic  devices  not  listed,  the  user  will  provide  the  aircrew  a  letter  from  the  Aeronautical Systems Division, Deputy for Engineering certifying the device is approved for airborne use.  If the  aircrew  detects  any  interference  from  an  electronic  device  used  aboard  the  aircraft, discontinue the use of this device for the duration of the flight.  (T-2) 6.51.  Jamming and Interference.  All aircrews and other radio users must be familiar with the procedures for reporting incidents of meaconing, intrusion, jamming, and interference (MIJI) or Spectrum Interference (SI).  Info copy HQ AFSOC/A3TW on all MIJI/SI reports. 6.52.  Passenger Guidance.  DoD 4515.13-R, Air Transportation Eligibility, establishes criteria for passenger movement on DoD aircraft.  AFI 11-401, provides further guidance on orientation and  public  affairs  travel.    Refer  to  these  publications  directly.    In  all  cases,  passengers  will  be manifested on DD Form 96, Passenger Manifest.  (T-3) 6.52.1.  During  spouse  orientation  flights,  threat  reaction  maneuvers  are  prohibited  and spouses will not fly together on the same aircraft.  (T-2) 6.52.2.  For  other  orientation  categories,  passengers  will  be  seated  with  seatbelts  fastened during threat maneuvers.  (T-3) 6.52.3.  Space-required.    DoD  4515.13-R  lists  several  categories  of  passengers,  not previously  mentioned,  who  are  authorized  official  travel  on  DoD  aircraft.    The  OG/CC  or COMAFSOF  will  determine  and  approve  eligibility  for  all  space  required  categories.  Reference Table 5.1 and AFI 11-401 for more information.  (T-3) 6.53.  Utilization  of  Civilian  Law  Enforcement  or  Medical  Personnel.  Generally,  before transporting  civilian  law  enforcement  officials  or  civilian  medical  personnel,  obtain  proper authorization through OG/CC or COMAFSOF.  Civilian law enforcement or medical personnel may  be  required  to  perform  duties  at  an  accident  site.    These  duties  may  include  death determination  or  human  remains  removal.    Local  and  international  laws  may  affect  mission prosecution and should be reviewed prior to deployment or pickup of civilian personnel.  (T-2) AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015   53  6.53.1.  Commanders  will  not  transport  civilian  law  enforcement  personnel  into  areas  of imminent danger or where confrontation with civilian criminal targets is likely, will not use military force against civilian criminal targets unless in self-defense, and will not direct the action of civilian authorities in enforcing the law or making arrests.  (T-2) 6.54.  Hazardous  Material  Procedures.  The term “hazardous material” includes any material, which, because of its quantity, properties, or packaging, may  endanger human life or property.  Procedures in this paragraph apply whenever aircraft carry DoD Hazard Class/Division 1.1, 1.2, or  1.3  explosives,  Department  of  Transportation  (DoT)  Class  A  and  B  poisons,  etiological  or biological research materials, radioactive materials requiring yellow III labels, and inert devices.  Also  included  are  DoD  Hazard  Class/Division  1.4  explosives,  oxidizers,  compressed  gases, flammable  solids  and  liquids,  and  corrosive  liquids  listed  in  AFMAN  24-204(I),  Preparing Hazardous Materials for Military Air Shipment. 6.54.1.  Briefing.    Reference  AFMAN  24-204(I),  Preparing  Hazardous  Materials  for Military Air Shipment. 6.54.2.  Cargo  Documentation.   Do  not  accept  hazardous  materials  unless  proper documentation,  certification,  and  identification  of  cargo  are  provided.    This  includes transportation control number entered correctly on both the cargo manifest and the Shipper‘s Declaration for Dangerous Goods.  (T-3) 6.54.3.  Flight Planning.  The PIC (unless specifically briefed otherwise): 6.54.3.1.  Enters Hazardous Cargo and the mission number in the appropriate section of the flight plan.  Use remarks section of DD Form 175, Military Flight Plan, information section of DD Form 1801, DoD International Flight Plan, or ICAO Flight Plan Form. 6.54.3.2.  Plans the flight to minimize over-flying heavily populated or otherwise critical areas. 6.54.3.3.  Prepares  a  departure  message.    The  remarks  section  of  the  departure  message should include the following: 6.54.3.3.1.  DoT  class  and  DoD  hazard  class  or  division,  if  applicable,  of hazardous material on board (include net weight of DoT Class A or B poisons and net explosive weight of Class A or B explosives). 6.54.3.3.2.  Request  for  special  support  (e.g.,  isolated  parking,  security,  technical escort teams, etc.). 6.54.3.3.3.  Inert devices (when applicable). 6.54.3.4.  If ETE is less than 1 hour, or if other circumstances preclude timely receipt at destination, notify base operations at the first intended landing, by priority telephone. 6.54.4.  Before  Engine  Start.    Ensure  placards  are  removed.    Give  the  controlling  agency parking  location,  approximate  engine  start  time,  and  verify  that  the  firefighting  agency  has the  hazardous  materials  information.    If  not,  request  the  following  be  relayed  to  the firefighting agency: 6.54.4.1.  DoT class of hazardous material on board and the DoD hazard class or division for explosive material on board.   54  AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015 6.54.4.2.  Net Explosive Weight. 6.54.4.3.  Request for isolated parking (if necessary). 6.54.4.4.  Estimated time of departure. 6.54.5.  En  Route.    Normal  procedures  apply.    Avoid  flying  over  heavily  populated  or otherwise critical areas. 6.54.6.  Before  Landing.    Accomplish  the  following  unless  specifically  prohibited  by  the theater commander or FLIP planning: 6.54.6.1.  Contact  the  base  operations  dispatcher,  control  tower,    approach  control,  or other agency specified in FLIP at least 30 minutes (or as soon as practical) before ETA to announce  that  hazardous  materials  are  on  board  and  to  verify  that  the  appropriate  base support  agencies  have  received  the  departure  message.    If  not,  transmit  the  mission number, ETA, and information. 6.54.6.2.  If  landing  at  a  CONUS  civil  airport  without  a  tower,  give  the  previous information to the nearest FAA flight service station. 6.54.6.3.  Request the information is relayed immediately to base operations or the civil airport manager, crash or fire protection agency, and other support agencies. 6.54.7.  Parking: 6.54.7.1.  DoD  requires  aircraft  carrying  DoD  Hazard  Class  or  Division  1.1,  1.2,  1.3 explosives, DoT Class A poisons, and certain biological agents and munitions be parked in  areas  isolated  from  personnel.    PIC‘s  are  responsible  for  ensuring  cargo  is  correctly identified to the tower and ground control.  When aircraft are not directed to an isolated area,  identify  the  cargo  again  to  tower  or  ground  control.    When  identification  is acknowledged, the host is solely responsible for selecting the parking area.  Should host procedures  be  questionable,  submit  trip  reports,  as  appropriate,  to  document  such occurrences. 6.54.7.2.  The  military  host  is  responsible  for  ensuring  aircraft  are  properly  placarded.  For  non-military  installations,  the  briefing  to  the  PIC  will  include  placard  requirements and,  if  required,  placards  will  be  furnished  at  the  onload  base.    The  shipper  must  make prior  arrangements  with  the  airport  manager  for  shipments  of  hazardous  materials requiring  placards.    The  shipper  is  responsible  for  cargo  identification,  firefighting procedures, and isolated parking requirements. 6.54.8.  Unscheduled  Landing  Due  to  IFE.    Transmit  unclassified  information  to  the appropriate air traffic control facility as follows: 6.54.8.1.  Nature of emergency and intent to land. 6.54.8.2.  Aircraft position and ETA. 6.54.8.3.  Number of personnel and location in aircraft. 6.54.8.4.  Fuel on board. 6.54.8.5.  That  hazardous  materials  are  on  board,  location  of  the  cargo,  and  applicable information. AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015   55  6.54.8.6.  After Unscheduled Landing.  Contact the AFSOC Command Center or theater CC  by  telephone,  HF  radio,  or  message,  giving  arrival  notice,  hazardous  materials information, and other pertinent information as required.  (T-3) 6.55.  Hazardous Medical Equipment. 6.55.1.  Nonstandard  equipment  possessed  by  medical  facilities  that  use  AFSOC  air evacuation  services  should  be  regarded  as  potentially  hazardous.    Two  types  of  equipment are of major concern: 6.55.1.1.  Electronic  medical  equipment  produces  electromagnetic  interference  which  is commonly beyond the limits  specified by Military Standard (MIL STD)  461A and 462, and therefore can interfere with aircraft communication and navigational equipment. 6.55.1.2.  Therapeutic  oxygen  systems  present  an  increased  hazard  of  fire  or  explosion.  A  potential  hazard  is  the  inadvertent  disruption  of  the  cylinder  neck,  manifold,  or regulator resulting in explosion and propulsion of the container or accessories. 6.55.2.  For nonstandard electronic medical equipment, take the following precautions (T-3): 6.55.2.1.  Pararescue  or  aeromedical  evacuation  personnel  must  inform  the  PIC  when nonstandard electronic medical equipment is brought on board the aircraft. 6.55.2.2.  The  PIC  must  be  informed  of  the  anticipated  period  of  use  of  the  equipment during the mission. 6.55.2.3.  The  PIC  must  be  alert  for  any  interference  with  aircraft  communications  or navigation equipment during periods of use of this equipment. 6.55.2.4.  When  continuous  use  of  the  equipment  is  required  throughout  the  duration  of the  mission,  flight  must  be  restricted  to  VFR  conditions.    Furthermore,  exercise additional  caution  on  night  VFR  missions  to  ensure  there  are  no  adverse  effects  on navigational equipment. 6.55.3.  For nonstandard oxygen equipment, take the following precautions: 6.55.3.1.  All  compressed  oxygen  equipment  with  exposed,  unprotected  cylinder  neck, manifold, or regulator must be completely secured from all movement in its longitudinal and lateral axes. 6.55.3.2.  Pararescue  or  aeromedical  evacuation  personnel  must  continually  monitor  the operation of the equipment to detect possible malfunction during exposure to altitude. 6.56.  Narcotics.  Aircrew  members  will  ensure  narcotics  and  other  unauthorized  items  are  not smuggled  onboard  the  aircraft.    Maintain  narcotics  that  are  part  of  official  medical  kits  in accordance with appropriate directives.  (T-2) 6.57.  Dropped  Objects.  During  aircraft  exterior  visual  inspections,  pay  particular  attention  to surfaces,  panels,  and  components,  which  could  potentially  be  dropped  objects.    If  a  dropped object is discovered and the mission is continued, the PIC will: 6.57.1.  Ensure documentation is entered into the aircraft maintenance forms. 6.57.2.  Notify the controlling agency  as soon as practical.    Include route of flight,  altitude, and weather conditions encountered.   56  AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015 Chapter 7 AIRCRAFT SECURITY 7.1.  General.  This  chapter provides  guidance  for aircraft security  on the ground  and in-flight.  C-145A  aircraft  are  Protection  Level  (PL)  4  resources  in  CONUS  and  PL3  while  OCONUS.  This  security  priority  designation  applies  to  operational  aircraft,  wherever  they  are  located, worldwide.    Some  aircraft  contain  equipment  and  documents  that  require  protection  per DoD 5200.1,V1-4  Information  Security  Program    and  AFI  31-401,  Information  Security Program Management. 7.2.  Procedures.  The  PIC  is  ultimately  responsible  for  the  security  of  their  aircraft  when located  away  from  US  military  installations.    AFJI  31-102,  Physical  Security,  covers  security arrangements  when  US  Air  Force  aircraft  are  located  on  other  US  military  installations.  Arrangements must be  made to  protect  the aircraft during crew rest status at  non-US  protected locations.    If  US  military  security  forces  are  not  available,  the  US  embassy  assigned  to  that country must be consulted to ensure security arrangements are made.  For missions involving a planning  agency,  the  agency  must  coordinate  with  the  PIC  to  ensure  the  planned  security measures  conform  to  mission  requirements.    The  amount  of  security  required  will  vary, depending on location and ground time.  (T-2) 7.2.1.  For  nonpermissive  or  uncertain  environments,  airfield  and  LZ  security  is  the responsibility of the agency requesting support.  Crews will work with the agency requesting support to insure security meets the requirement for the mission. 7.2.2.  For  permissive  environments,  the  PIC  will  receive  a  threat  assessment  and  force protection  capability  evaluation  briefing  at  home  station  prior  to  departure  and  receive updates en route, if required.  When landing at DoD component installations, the installation commander  is  responsible  for  providing  adequate  security  for  the  aircraft.    The  PIC  will determine if security is adequate.  Planning agencies and the PIC will use Table 7.1 to help assess  the  risk  to  parked  aircraft  for  planned  overnight  stops  located  at  overseas  non-US military installations and civilian airfields.  (T-2)        Note:  Aircrews possess the training to provide the appropriate security when present at the aircraft.  For unscheduled or emergency landings at non-USAF installations, the PIC will assess the aircraft security situation and take the following actions, if force protection capability appears insufficient (T-2): 7.2.2.1.  Aircrew  surveillance.    If  the  aircraft  is  not  remaining  overnight,  aircrews  are capable  of  maintaining  appropriate  aircraft  security.    The  PIC  will  direct  armed  crew members  to  remain  with  the  aircraft  and  maintain  surveillance  of  aircraft  entrances  and activities in the aircraft vicinity. 7.2.2.2.  Area Patrol.  Request area patrol coverage from local security forces to include back-up  response  forces.    If  local  authorities  request  payment  for  this  service,  use  AF Form 15, USAF Invoice. 7.2.2.3.  Departure  without  Crew  Rest.    If  local  security  forces  are  unacceptable  or unavailable,  the  PIC  may  waive  FDP  restrictions  and  depart  as  soon  as  possible  for  a destination with adequate force protection.  If unable to depart the location due to system malfunction, the aircrew must secure the aircraft to the best of their ability.  In no case, will  the  entire  crew  leave  the  aircraft  unattended.    Crew  rest  requirements  will  be AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015   57  subordinate to aircraft security when the aircraft may be at risk.  The PIC should rotate a security detail among the crew to provide for both aircraft protection and crew rest until relief is  available.  The  PIC will coordinate through appropriate C2 channels  to  acquire additional security.  (T-2) 7.2.2.4.  Tailored  Security  Measures.    Standard  physical  security  measures  may  be impractical  at  times due  to  mission, terrain,  climate, sociopolitical  sensitivities, or other factors.    For  example,  some  countries  don't  allow  armed  security  personnel.    On  other deployments,  the  mission  may  rely  on  maintaining  a  low  profile  and  attracting  as  little attention  as  possible.    At  such  locations,  tailor  security  measures  to  meet  unique requirements when necessary.  As a minimum, lock aircraft entry points and hatches.  If it is  not  possible  to  lock  aircraft,  secure  aircraft  entry  points  and  hatches  in  a  manner  to indicate unauthorized entry (i.e., taping hatch release handles or using seals).  The PIC is the final authority for determining tailored security measures.  Contact with US Embassy personnel is required at locations where security agreements are not in existence.  (T-2) 7.2.3.  Ground  security  teams.    Ground  security  teams  may  be  considered  to  guard  the aircraft for planned overnight stops.  Teams may travel in MEP status and are responsible to the PIC at all times.  The PIC will ensure security team members receive a mission briefing, aircraft egress,  and passenger briefings, as appropriate.  The flying squadron commander is the  final  approval  authority  for  the  need  of  ground  security  teams  for  their  aircraft  and authority may be delegated no lower than the PIC.  (T-2) 7.2.3.1.  Ground  security  teams  will  comply  with  AFMAN  24-204(I),  Preparing Hazardous  Materials  for  Military  Air  Shipments,  at  all  times  when  carrying  weapons, ammunition, and equipment onboard the aircraft. 7.2.3.2.  Due  to  the  sensitivity  of  weapons  in  foreign  countries,  ground  security  teams will keep their weapons  inside the aircraft  and out-of-sight of  foreign nationals, even if the FCG allows them to be carried outside the aircraft.  If a destination requires weapons be carried outside the aircraft, the controlling MAJCOM must approve such action prior to deployment. 7.2.4.  Unauthorized  Entry.    At  the  discretion  of  the  PIC,  the  aircraft  should  be  locked  and sealed as a measure to detect unauthorized entry.  (T-3) 7.2.4.1.  If the aircraft lock is unavailable, secure the hatches and doors in a manner that will  indicate  unauthorized  entry.    For  example,  tape  inside  hatch  release  handles  to  the airframe,  so  that  entry  pulls  the  tape  loose.    Close  and  seal  doors  using  a  metal  boxcar seal  or  other  controllable  device  to  identify  forced  entry.    Wipe  the  immediate  area around the seal  to  help  investigate forced  entry.    If the seals  are damaged or have been tampered  with,  notify  the  appropriate  local  authorities,  the  controlling  agency,  and inspect the aircraft thoroughly.  (T-3) 7.2.4.2.  Coordinate  with  the  local  base  operations  representative  on  procedures  for servicing the aircraft while the crew is away.  If a padlock is used, the key or combination may  be  left  with  base  operations  or  the  representative  for  servicing  and  maintenance personnel if required. 7.2.5.  Security  awareness  is  crucial  to  effective  mission  accomplishment.    Aircrews  must always remain vigilant to their surroundings, especially at high threat, low security locations.    58  AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015 During  preflight  activities,  aircrews  will  inspect  accessible  areas  to  include  aircraft  wheel-wells,  air-conditioning  compartments,  and  cargo  compartment  for  unauthorized  packages, personnel, or other unfamiliar devices.  Report any suspicious items to host security forces.  Aircrews will maintain a heightened security posture throughout all pre-takeoff activities. 7.3.  Aircraft  Security  Risk  Assessment  Matrix.  Planning agencies and the PIC will use this matrix to help assess the risk to parked aircraft in a permissive environment.  This matrix will be used for planned overnight stops at overseas non-US military installations and civilian airfields.  A cumulative score of less than 55 implies that normal unmanned aircraft security measures are adequate.    A  score  of  55  to  90  implies  moderate  security  risk.    The  squadron  or  mission commander may  consider additional security measures.   If the cumulative score is  greater than 90, commanders should consider deploying or contracting security personnel.  The squadron or mission commander is the final approval authority for aircraft security issues.  Authority may be delegated no lower than the PIC.  (T-3)            Exception:  During unscheduled or emergency landings, the PIC is the final approval authority for aircraft security.  The PIC should contact the US Embassy or US Defense Attaché Office (USDAO) for security assistance.  Note:  Normally, additional security for the aircraft is not required at military installations within a North Atlantic Treaty  Organization the FAA/Transportation Security Administration (TSA).

Protective  Standards  for  Aircraft  Carrying  Distinguished  Visitors  (DV).  This paragraph  applies  specifically  to  aircraft  transporting  DV  Code  4  or  above.    The  PIC  is responsible for aircraft security at en route stops. 7.4.1.  DoD Installations.  Notify the base security forces of estimated arrival and departure times.    Request  continuous  security  surveillance  during  the  entire  ground  time.    If  the installation is unable to comply, arrange for the best protection available. 7.4.2.  Non-DoD  Installations.    Contact  the  airport  manager  or  installation  commander  to arrange for force protection.  If available security is inadequate, purchase additional security using AF Form 15, USAF Invoice. 7.5.  Arming  of  Crew  members.  The  squadron  CC,  DO,  or  MC  may  direct  arming  of  crew members  as  deemed  necessary  by  mission  threat  analysis.    Protect  all  weapons  IAW AFI 31207, Arming  and  Use  of  Force  by  Air  Force  Personnel  and  AFMAN  31-229,  USAF Weapons Handling Manual.  (T-3) 7.5.1.  Weapons Issue.  Before departing home station, authorized crew members will obtain weapons, ammunition, lock, and key.  Crew members must present a current AF Form 523, USAF  Authorization  to  Bear  Firearms,  to  be  issued  a  weapon.    Crew  members  will  be reissued  the  same  weapon  until  the  mission  terminates  at  home  station.    If  an  armed  crew member  must  leave  the  crew  en  route,  transfer  the  weapon  to  another  authorized  crew member, using AF Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt.  (T-3)   60  AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015 7.5.2.  Loading  and  Transfer  of  Weapons.    Load  and  unload  weapons  at  approved  clearing barrels/facilities if available.  To transfer a loaded weapon to another crew member, place the weapon on a flat surface.  Do not use a hand-to-hand transfer.  (T-3) 7.5.3.  Wearing  of  Weapons.    Unless  in  combat  operations,  wear  weapons  in  a  holster, concealed at all times to protect the identity of armed crew members.  Do not wear weapons off  the  flightline,  except  to  and  from  the  command  post,  armories,  and  other  facilities associated  with  aircrew  activities  such  as  base  operations,  fleet  service,  cargo  or  passenger terminals, flightline cafeterias, snack bars, etc.  (T-3) 7.5.4.  Weapons Storage.  Crew members will be armed before beginning preflight or onload duties.  When no passengers are on board and after a satisfactory stowaway check, weapons may  be  stored  in  the  gun  box  in-flight.    If  no  gun  box  is  available  retain  weapon  for  the duration  of  the  flight.    Crew  members  will  rearm  before  landing.    Weapons  need  not  be unloaded before being placed in the gun box.  (T-3) 7.5.5.  Crew  Rest.    During  crew  rest,  store  weapons  in  the  most  secure  facility  available, normally  the  base  armory.    If  a  weapons  storage  facility  is  unavailable  or  the  country prohibits or restricts the entry of weapons, secure firearms and ammunition in the gun box.  (T-3) 7.5.5.1.  Aircraft  without  a  Gun  Box.    If  an  aircraft  without  a  gun  box  must  remain overnight at a location where a government-owned storage facility is unavailable, use the nearest  acceptable  facility.    Acceptable  storage  facilities  are  US  or  Allied  military services  armories,  US  National  Guard  and  Reserve  armories,  US  civil  law  enforcement armories, and US Embassies.  If none of these are available, or the PIC believes weapons security may be compromised, crew members may secure their weapons in their quarters.  One  crew  member  will  remain  with  the  weapons  at  all  times.    In  this  case,  turn  the ammunition over to the PIC.  (T-3) 7.6.  General  Antihijacking  Guidance.  Aircrews  must  make  every  reasonable  effort  to  resist an  aircraft  hijacking  attempt,  resistance  may  vary  from  dissuasion,  to  direct  physical confrontation,  including  the  use  of  deadly  force  IAW  Chairman  of  the  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff Instruction  (CJCSI)  3121.01B,  Standing  Rules  of  Engagement/Standing  Rules  for  the  Use  of Force  for  US  Forces,  and  all  applicable  ROE/Rules  for  the  Use  of  Force  (RUF).    Due  to  the sensitive  nature  of  anti-hijacking  procedures,  crew  members  should  reference  AFI  13-207, Preventing and Resisting Aircraft Piracy (FOUO), and the FIH for specific guidance.  Aircrews will  not  release  any those  procedures  or  hijacking  attempts.  Antihijacking is  a crew  duty performed  exclusively by  aircrew personnel.  The hijacking of an AFSOC  aircraft  could  create  a  serious  international  incident  and  jeopardize  the  safety  of passengers  and  property.    An  aircraft  is  most  vulnerable  when  the  crew  is  on  board  and  the aircraft  is  ready  for  flight.    Hijackers  cannot  be  dealt  with  as  ordinary  criminals.    Some  are mentally  disturbed,  emotionally  unstable  individuals  for  whom  the  threat  of  death  is  not  a deterrent, but a stimulus to crime.  Delay tactics have been most successful in saving lives and property.  Detection of potential hijackers before they board the aircraft is the best solution to the problem.  (T-3) information  concerning 7.6.1.  Acceptance  of  Passengers.    The  host  station  passenger  processing  and  manifesting facility should conduct antihijacking inspections.  Do not board passengers unless the aircraft AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015   61  commander  is  fully  satisfied  with  these  inspections.    (T-3)                            Exception:  Supporting/supported forces may be antihijack inspected at the aircraft by the aircrew. 7.6.1.1.  Aeromedical Procedures.  Military medical facility commanders are responsible for the anti-hijacking inspection of  patients.   When patients  are delivered to  the aircraft by civilian sources, the aircrew will perform required inspections before departure.  (T-3) 7.6.1.2.  Contingency  and  exercise  movements.    During  contingencies  in  support  of combat operations and exercises involving the movement of large numbers of personnel, the supported unit should manifest passengers and perform antihijacking inspections.  (T-3) 7.6.2.  Arms  and  Ammunition.    Passengers  (including  MEP)  will  not  carry  weapons  and/or ammunition  on  their  person  or  in  hand-carried  baggage  on  board  an  aircraft.    (T-3)       Exception:    Special  agents/guards  of  the  Secret  Service  or  State  Department,  and  other individuals  specifically  authorized  to  carry  weapons  in  coordination  with  the  PIC.    In  all cases, the crew will be aware of the location of weapons and ammunition. 7.6.2.1.  If individuals must  clear their weapons  before boarding the aircraft, and access to clearing barrel/facilities is limited, as a minimum, direct them to (T-3): 7.6.2.1.1.  Move to a safe, clear area at least 50 feet from any aircraft, equipment, or personnel before unholstering/unslinging their weapons. 7.6.2.1.2.  Clear their weapons in accordance with standard safety procedures. 7.6.3.  Troops  and  deadhead  crew  members  will  not  retain  custody  of  ammunition  on  the aircraft  but  will  turn  it  in  to  the  troop  commander  or  PIC.    (T-3)              Exception:    During combat  operations,  troops  may  carry  unloaded  weapons  and  ammunition  on  board  the aircraft.    When  the  tactical  situation  dictates,  personnel  who  will  engage  an  enemy  force immediately upon deplaning at the objective may carry loaded weapons on board the aircraft at the discretion of the troop commander/team leader with the PIC‘s concurrence.  Weapons will not be breached until clear of the aircraft.  (T-3) 7.7.  Specific Antihijacking Guidance.  It is imperative that all crew members are familiar with the  ground  and  in-flight  resistance  actions  and  forced  penetration  of  unfriendly  airspace procedures in AFI 13-207, Preventing and Resisting Aircraft Piracy (Hijacking), and the FIH.  In the  event  of  a  hijacking,  crew  members  must  act  immediately  and  resourcefully,  without instruction, in order to counter the attacker successfully.   62  AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015 Chapter 8 MISSION EMPLOYMENT 8.1.  Terminal Operations. 8.1.1.  Takeoff Procedures.  If time and conditions allow, compute aircraft performance data prior to departure if personnel, equipment, or fuel have been onloaded/offloaded.  If time and conditions do not allow, use the preplanned worst case TOLD data that was computed during mission planning.  (T-1) 8.1.2.  If  any  degradation  in  onboard  systems  is  discovered  which  could  result  in  loss  of situational  awareness  during  approach,  the  PIC  will  inform  the  crew.    The  decision  to proceed rests with the PIC. 8.1.3.  Go-Around  Calls.    If  any  crew  member  calls  “Go-around”  the  PF  will  immediately apply power to establish a climb that clears all obstacles.  Minimum altitude for overflight of aircraft, equipment, or personnel on the runway is 500 feet AGL. 8.2.  Tactical Operations.  Execute the proper tactical procedure based upon threat analysis and aircraft performance.  For all tactical operations, follow theater specific ATC procedures to avoid potential conflicts. 8.2.1.  Radio  Communication.    The  PIC  will  plan  and  brief  individual  responsibilities  for secure  communication  loading,  voice  radio  configuration  and  communication  during  the mission.  Coordination between all crew members is essential for safe and effective mission accomplishment.  All crew members that have the capability to monitor radios must be alert to  back  up  the  assigned  crew  members  when  duties  allow.    The  PIC  will  assign  radio monitoring  and  transmission  duties  after  examining  each  phase  of  flight  for  mission requirements and individual workload.  (T-3) 8.2.2.  Preparation for NVG Operations.  Cockpit and cabin lights may be taped or covered with  NVG  compatible  film  if  they  will  interfere  with  NVG  operations  and  cannot  be otherwise disabled without removing aircraft power (e.g.  pulling circuit breakers). 8.2.3.  Tactical Departures. 8.2.3.1.  Spiral  Departure.   Using  Maximum  Climb  Power  settings  and  aircraft configuration  IAW  the  POH,  climb  at  best  rate  of  climb  speed  (Vy)  while  turning  the aircraft to remain inside the secure area above or around the airfield.  It is recommended to  use  no  more  than  30°  of  bank.    If  the  aircraft  cannot  be  kept  in  the  secure  area  or obstacles  are  a  factor,  climb  at  best  angle  of  climb  speed  (Vx)  while  still  attempting  to use no more than 30° of bank.   If able, climb  to  cruise altitude or an altitude above the threat before departing the secure area.  Note:  If 30° of bank is exceeded, crews should pay particular attention to increased stall speeds at high angles of attack. 8.2.3.2.  Low  Departure.    Use  the  entire  runway  available  in  order  to  depart  the  secure perimeter of the airfield at the highest possible speed and at the highest altitude the threat will allow.  Place the aircraft in a clean configuration as soon as possible after liftoff.  Set maximum  continuous  climb  power  settings  (IAW  POH)  after  the  aircraft  is  in  a  clean configuration.  Once clear of the threat, immediately climb to cruise altitude. AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015   63  8.2.4.  Tactical Arrivals. 8.2.4.1.  Reference  the  C-145A  handbook  for  recommended  techniques  on  tactical arrivals. 8.3.  Aircraft Navigation Systems. 8.3.1.  GPS  approaches.    The  C-145A  is  certified  to  fly  GPS  or  Area  Navigation  (RNAV) approaches to Lateral Navigation (LNAV) MDA minimums.  The PF will confirm Random Asynchronous Integrity Monitor (RAIM) prior to commencing any GPS or RNAV approach or flying any portion of a GPS and/or missed approach segment.  Accomplishing the RAIM check during pre-mission planning meets this intent.  (T-3) 8.3.2.  Self-Contained Approaches.  Although some GPS or FMS navigation systems enable approaches and pseudo approaches to be constructed and flown, these type approaches may only  be  used  as  a  situational  awareness  aid  and  may  not  be  used  as  the  sole  means  of navigating to a runway or LZ in IMC.  Unless GPS Overlay requirements in AFI 11-202, Vol 3, are met, aircrews must fly under normal VFR or theater specific VFR guidance, whichever is  more  restrictive.    (T-3)                  WARNING:    Self-constructed  approaches  and  pseudo approaches do not guarantee obstacle or terrain clearance. 8.4.  Combat Entry/Exit Criteria. 8.4.1.  The  Combat  Entry/Combat  Exit  checklists  will  be  used  for  all  combat  and  combat related  missions.    Although  not  necessary  for  training  missions,  crews  should  familiarize themselves  with  these  checklists  on  local  training  sorties.    In  addition,  the  “FENCE” acronym  can  be  used  to  help  aircrew  prepare  the  aircraft  prior  to  entry  into  and  exit  from combat operations.  These procedures may be modified as the situation and aircraft requires.  Use the FENCE acronym after passing the combat exit point to aid in configuring the aircraft for normal flight operations. 8.4.1.1.  F  –  Fuel.    Check  fuel  balance  and  quantity.    The  PIC  will  establish  a  BINGO fuel  to  ensure  the  aircraft  arrives  at  destination  or  alternate  with  required  fuel  reserves IAW AFI 11202, Vol 3, and this instruction. 8.4.1.2.  E  –  Engine(s)/Electrics.    Check  electrical  system  for  normal  operation,  to include all generators, battery, and inverters as applicable.  Check all engine gauges for normal indications.  Confirm TOLD and aircraft performance will allow for safe aircraft and mission operations. 8.4.1.3.  N  –  Navigation.    Set-up  required  navigational  equipment  (navigational  and aircraft  performance  instruments,  GPS,  traffic  collision  avoidance  systems  (TCAS), Enhanced  Ground  Proximity  Warning  System  (EGPWS),  radar  altimeters,  etc.)  as required to increase situational and positional awareness for mission.  If altimeter setting below  transition  altitude  or  level  is  unknown  for  mission/objective  area,  set  the  highest altimeter setting reported for the area until obtaining an accurate altimeter setting. 8.4.1.4.  C  –  Communications.    Set  the  communication  radios  and  systems  as  required.  The  PIC  will  outline  aircrew  radio  responsibilities  and  configurations  for  the  mission requirements. 8.4.1.5.  E – Emitters.  Consider emission devices that are not essential to navigation or safety,  but  may  pose  a  threat  to  the  detection  of  the  aircraft.    Consider  minimal   64  AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015 operational  settings  for  systems  like  the  transponder,  weather  radar,  VORs,  distance measuring  equipment  (DME),  etc.    Turn  off  interior  and  exterior  lights  that  are  not needed  for  safety  or  distracting  under  NVGs.    Although  a  passive  detection  system,  set the  aircraft  defensive  systems,  if  applicable,  to  comply  with  theater  directives  while providing aircrew with the greatest amount of threat detection and protection. 8.4.2.  Complete  combat  exit  criteria  using  the  FENCE  acronym  in  reverse  order  once  the aircraft  has  departed  the  combat  environment  or  upon  mission  completion  to  aid  in-flight safety when not in the combat (simulated or actual) environment. 8.5.  Austere  Landing  Zone  Operations.  Only  fully  mission  qualified  aircrews  or  those receiving  instruction  are  authorized  to  operate  in  accordance  with  this  section.    Use  normal takeoff and landing procedures whenever practical.  (T-2) 8.5.1.  Landing  Zone  Assessment.    Landing  Zone  assessment  is  crucial  to  safe  mission accomplishment.    Crews  should  use  all  available  sources  for  mission  planning.    Carefully evaluate  aircraft  capabilities  and  the  mission  environment  before  the  operation.    At  a minimum, consider the following: 8.5.1.1.  Security of the operating area. 8.5.1.2.  Terrain and obstacle features along the approach or departure path. 8.5.1.3.  Runway surface conditions (e.g., dirt, grass, dust, small holes, damaged Pierced Steel Plank (PSP), smooth, rough, etc.). 8.5.1.4.  Surface temperature and density altitude. 8.5.1.5.  Usable runway length and width. 8.5.1.6.  Surface acceleration and deceleration factors (e.g., soft, dry, wet, ice, and slope). 8.5.1.7.  Actual and predicted gross weight of aircraft. 8.5.1.8.  Surface winds (e.g., headwind, tailwind, crosswinds, gusty, turbulence). 8.5.1.9.  Number of takeoffs and landings required. 8.5.1.10.  Ground Plan (e.g., ERO, vehicles, marshaling, on/offload locations, etc.). 8.6.  Arrival.  Plan arrival altitudes to minimize conflict with terrain or other airborne traffic. 8.7.  Traffic  Pattern.  When the environment permits, fly normal traffic patterns.  Terrain may require  significant  modifications  to  normal  traffic  patterns.    Options  are  to  enter  the  traffic pattern via an initial, downwind, base, straight-in, or perpendicular to the runway. 8.8.  Specific  Aircrew  Procedures.  The following procedures are recommended in addition to the normal procedures in the POH: 8.8.1.  During  the  final  stage  of  landing  roll,  reduce  reverse  thrust,  if  conditions  permit,  to prevent debris from causing a restriction to visibility or engine damage. 8.8.2.  Do not land if the LZ is not properly identified or an abort signal is given. 8.8.3.  Brief  the  ground  party  and  subsequent  aircrews  on  any  unexpected  hazards encountered during takeoff or landing. AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015   65  8.9.  Combat  Loading.  Combat  loading  is  comprised  of  three  types  of  operations:    combat offload, passenger combat loading, and rapid infiltration. 8.9.1.  Combat  Offload  Training.    No  special  authorization  is  required  for  combat  offload training using unilateral training loads. 8.9.2.  Passenger  Combat  Loading.    All  personnel  in  the  cargo  compartment  will  be  seated and secured except those crew members having valid duties to perform.  Use either personal restraining devices or aircraft tie-down straps.  (T-3) 8.9.2.1.  When  airlifting  litter  patients,  position  the  litters  longitudinally  with  patients’ heads aft (or as recommended by medical personnel) and secure each of the litters with a tie-down strap.  (T-3) 8.9.2.2.  For one litter:  hook the tie-down strap into a floor ring, run laterally, wrapping the strap around each litter handle once, hook the ratchet end to the nearest tie-down ring, and tighten. 8.9.2.3.  For two litters side by side:  use two tie-down straps for each end hooked into tie-down  rings,  run  the  straps  laterally,  one  left  and  one  right,  over  each  outboard  litter handle to the nearest tie-down ring, and tighten. 8.9.3.  Rapid Infiltration Procedures.  These procedures are only authorized when conducting infiltration  and/or  exfiltration  operations  with  Special  Operations  Forces.    All  personnel  in the cargo compartment  will be seated and secured except those crew members having valid duties  to  perform.    Troops  will  provide  their  own  restraining  devices.    If  troops  do  not provide  personal  restraining  devices,  secure  personnel  using  passenger  combat  loading procedures.  (T-3) 8.9.3.1.  The  loadmaster  may  use  IR  chemical  lights  taped  to  illuminate  inside  of  a blacked out cargo compartment if required. 8.9.3.2.  The loadmaster or additional crew member will notify personnel at 20 minutes, 10  minutes,  6  minutes,  1  minute,  and  immediately  prior  to  landing  by  stating  XX minute(s).  Give a Prepare to Land advisory when minimums have been called. 8.9.3.3.  Loadmasters  may  wear  NVGs  during  blacked  out  operations.    Loadmasters should wear NVGs on aircraft with NVG-compatible lighting; however, the NVGs may be raised when NVG lighting is operational and provides sufficient illumination for task accomplishment. 8.9.3.4.  Procedures  after  Touchdown.    These  procedures  should  be  performed  by  a qualified loadmaster but may be performed by a trained crew member. 8.9.3.4.1.  Open  the  cargo  door  when  the  pilot  states,  “CLEAR  TO  OPEN”  or  as briefed.  Offload personnel and cargo once the aircraft has stopped and the pilot states “CLEAR  TO  OFFLOAD”.                        Note:    If  a  time  delay  before  onloading  is anticipated be prepared to taxi in the event of an emergency. 8.9.3.4.2.  Complete on/offload. 8.9.3.4.3.  Notify the pilot, “CLEAR TO TAXI”. 8.9.3.4.4.  Close the door.   66  AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015 8.9.3.4.5.  Set  the  cargo  compartment  lighting  intensity  to  not  interfere  with  cockpit operations. 8.9.3.4.6.  Prior to takeoff, ensure vehicles and/or equipment and exits are secure, and warning lights are extinguished. 8.9.3.4.7.  Check  vehicle  tie-downs  and  secure  cargo  compartment  after  takeoff  as soon as mission requirements allow. 8.10.  Causalty  Evacuation  (CASEVAC)  or  Medical  Evacuation  (MEDEVAC).  C-145A aircraft are not normally used for MEDEVAC missions due to weight and equipment constraints.  If a CASEVAC is required, a prehospital Paramedic or higher trained medical provider should be onboard.  (T-2) 8.10.1.  Aircraft  configuration.    If  required  the  aircraft  will  be  reconfigured  IAW  the  POH.  For  Block  5  aircraft,  consider  removing  carpets  and  covering  the  floor  with  some  type  of barrier to contain body fluids and medical waste.  For Block 10 aircraft, the ruggedized floor is  designed  for  easy  cleanup  and/or  removal  if  required.    Consideration  should  be  given  to using  towels  or  other  material  to  catch  fluid  leaks  to  minimize  clean-up.    The  crew  will accomplish weight and balance for the new configuration. 8.10.2.  Medical  hazards.    Take  all  necessary  precautions  to  keep  the  crew  and  aircraft isolated from medical hazards. AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015   67  Chapter 9 TRAINING 9.1.  General.  See AFI 11-2C-145A, Vol 1, Aircrew Training, for additional information. 9.2.  Training Aircraft Not Capable of Flight.  If an aircraft is not capable of departure within 4  hours  after  scheduled  departure  time,  cancel  the  training  mission  unless  waived  by  the  PIC.  Departure  consists  of  actual  takeoffs  for  assigned  or  planned  training  missions  and  does  not include maintenance ops checks.  (T-3) 9.3.  Threat  Maneuver  Training.  The  PIC  will  brief  the  crew  during  the  pre-mission  brief when  threat  maneuvering  is  expected  to  be  accomplished.    The  PF  will make  advisory  calls  to the  aircrew  prior  to  beginning  the  evasive  maneuver.    Crew  members  will  clear  the  aircraft  of obstacles throughout the maneuvering. 9.4.  Not Used. 9.5.  Simulated Instrument Flight. 9.5.1.  The use of a hood or other artificial vision-restricting device is not authorized for any phase of flight.  (T-1) 9.5.2.  Initiate practice instrument missed approaches no lower than the minimum altitude for the approach being flown.  (T-2) 9.6.  Confidence  Maneuvers.  All  confidence  maneuvers  will  be  accomplished  in  VMC conditions under VFR with a discernible horizon.  Ensure the airspace around the aircraft is clear of traffic by visually clearing the area prior to the maneuver.  Do not exceed POH limitations. 9.6.1.  Stall Series.  Begin stall series at least 5,000 feet AGL or 5,000 feet above the clouds if operating VFR on top.  For stall series training, recover from the stall at the first definite indication (e.g., stick shaker, actual stall of aircraft, decay of control effectiveness).  An IP at a set of flight controls is required to perform this maneuver.  (T-1) 9.6.1.1.  Power-Off  Stalls.    Determine  actual  stall  speeds  prior  to  maneuver.    The  stall may  be  entered  from  either  straight  or  turning  flight  in  the  approach  and  landing configuration.  Initiate recovery at the pre-briefed point, if engine revolutions per minute (RPM) decay is detected, or any abnormal engine indication is discovered.  (T-1) 9.6.1.2.  Power-On Stalls.  Determine actual stall speeds prior to maneuver.  In some high performance aircraft, the power setting for power-on stalls may have to be reduced below takeoff power to prevent excessive high pitch attitudes (greater than 30° nose up).  In the absence of a manufacturer recommended power setting, use no more than approximately 55-60 percent of full power as a guideline.  The stall should be entered in the takeoff or departure  configuration  and  at  an  airspeed  no  lower  than  reference  speed  (Vref)  for  the aircraft configuration.  Initiate recovery at the pre-briefed point, if engine RPM decay is detected, or any abnormal engine indication is discovered.  (T-1) 9.6.1.2.1.  Simulated  or  actual  engine-out,  power-on  stalls  are  prohibited.    (T-1)     CAUTION:  There is a density altitude above which the stall speed is higher than the engine inoperative minimum control speed.   68  AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015 9.6.2.  Steep  Turns.    Accomplish  steep  turns  at  least  1,500  feet  AGL,  1,500  feet  above  the clouds  if  operating  VFR  on  top,  or  the  manufacturer's  recommended  altitude,  whichever  is higher.  Accomplish both 45° and 60° bank steep turns.  Do not exceed 60° of bank.  (T-1) 9.6.3.  Spins.  Intentional spins in C-145A aircraft are prohibited.  (T-1) 9.6.4.  Slow  Flight.    Fly  5  Knots  Indicated  Airspeed  (KIAS)  below  Vref  for  aircraft configuration.  Do not exceed 15° of bank.  Authorized in day VMC only, at a minimum of 1,500 feet AGL or 1,500 feet above a clouds if operating VFR on top.  (T-1) 9.6.5.  Aerobatics.  Acrobatics are prohibited. 9.6.6.  Minimum  Control  Airspeed  (Vmca)  Demonstration.    Stall  speed  and  engine inoperative  minimum  control  airspeed  should  be  determined  prior  to  flight.    Authorized  in day  VMC  only,  at  a  minimum  altitude  so  that  recovery  is  completed  by  5,000  feet  AGL, 5,000 feet  above the cloud deck, or the manufacturer's recommended  altitude, whichever is higher.    Initiate  recovery  at  the  first  recognition  of  loss  of  directional  control  by simultaneously  reducing  the  power  on  the  operating  engine  and/or  reducing  the  angle  of attack as necessary to regain directional control and airspeed.  An IP at a set of flight controls is required to perform this maneuver.  (T-1)   CAUTION:  There is a density altitude above which the stall speed is higher than the engine inoperative Vmca.  When this density altitude exists below 5,000 AGL because of high elevations, high temperatures, or both, an effective flight  demonstration  of  loss  of  directional  control  may  be  hazardous  and  should  not  be attempted.  If it is determined prior to flight that the stall speed is above or equal to Vmca, this flight demonstration is impracticable. 9.7.  Simulated Emergency Procedures (EPs). 9.7.1.  Practice  simulated  EPs  which  require  placing  switches  in  other  than  their  normal position or the aircraft in an abnormal configuration as specified in the aircraft manual only during training, evaluation, or currency flights when an instructor or flight examiner pilot is in one of the pilot seats.  (T-1) 9.7.1.1.  IP candidates who occupy  a pilot  seat  and are under the supervision  of a flight examiner pilot, not in the seat, may practice simulated EPs during upgrade evaluations to IP.  (T-1) 9.7.1.2.  Preface  all  simulated  EPs  with  the  word  "simulated"  and  terminate  simulated emergencies when an actual emergency arises. 9.7.1.3.  Use  a  realistic  approach  and  do  not  compound  emergencies.    Limit  simulated EPs  to  appropriate  phases  of  flight.    Consider  student  proficiency  when  choosing  the appropriate  phase  of  flight  to  initiate  a  simulated  emergency.    Notify  the  controlling agency  if  a  nonstandard  traffic  pattern  or  pattern  requiring  special  sequencing  is anticipated. 9.7.1.4.  Do  not  perform  simulated  EPs  when  passengers  or  medical  crew  members (except flight surgeons performing required flight duties) are on board.  (T-1) 9.7.2.  Simulated Engine Failure.  Simulated engine failures will only be accomplished with an  IP  at  a  set  of  functional  aircraft  controls.    Minimum  weather  for  simulated  EPs  will  be circling minimums or greater.  (T-1) AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015   69  9.7.2.1.  Initiate  simulated  engine  failure  no  lower  than  200  feet  AGL  or  approach minimums if during an instrument approach.  The IP will initiate the emergency.  The IP will  set  10-15%  torque  on  the  simulated  failed  engine  to  simulate  a  feathered  propeller once the flying pilot correctly executes/applies the proper critical action procedure.  (T-1) 9.7.2.1.1.  Do not initiate simulated single-engine procedures below 92 KIAS. 9.7.2.2.  A go-around will be directed by the IP if a safe landing is not ensured. 9.7.2.2.1.  Simulated Engine Out Go-Around or Missed Approach.  Initiate simulated engine out  go-around or missed approach no lower than 200 feet  AGL  or minimum altitude for the approach.  (T-1) 9.7.2.3.  Aircrew  will  initiate  simulated  engine  failure  after  takeoff  (straight-ahead)  no lower than 300 feet AGL.  (T-1) 9.7.3.  The following guidance will be adhered to during all engine-out training: 9.7.3.1.  Normally  turns  should  be  planned  to  be  in  the  direction  of  the  operating engine(s). 9.7.3.2.  Turns  into  the  simulated  failed  engine  should  be  minimized.    Turns  into  the simulated failed engine are permissible but require a higher degree of pilot skill than with actual  failed  engines  and  must  be  smooth  and  coordinated.        WARNING:    Improper application  of  rudder  or  power  can  lead  to  an  immediate  out-of-control  situation  where recovery might not be possible. 9.7.4.  Aborted  Takeoff.    Authorized  during  day  or  night  Visual  Meteorological  Conditions (VMC),  with  or  without  NVGs.    Crosswind  component  must  not  exceed  14  knots.    The runway must be dry, a minimum width of 45 feet, and long enough to  meet normal takeoff distance requirements.  Initiate the abort by stating “REJECT” before 70 KIAS.  (T-1) 9.7.5.  Actual Engine Shutdown and Air Start.  One engine may be shut down in day VMC only at a minimum of 5,000 feet above the ground or cloud deck, whichever is higher.  Do not shut down the engine unless the aircraft can remain clear of clouds and recover and land under visual flight rules.  (T-1) 9.8.  Touch-And-Go/Stop-And-Go Operations. 9.8.1.  Conduct  touch-and-go  operations  IAW  the  POH  or  this  instruction’s  checklists.  Touch-and-go operations require two qualified pilots or an IP if the other pilot is unqualified or noncurrent.  (T-1) 9.8.1.1.  The touch-and-go checklists may be used when performing multiple instrument approaches or VFR pattern practice at the same airport or transitioning to another airport within 25 nm.  Pilots will complete all normal checklists after the initial takeoff or when transiting  to  another  airport  greater  than  25  nm  from  the  airport  where  the  instrument approach or VFR pattern practice was accomplished.  (T-2) 9.8.1.2.  When  conducting  touch-and-go  operations,  the  PF  initiates  the  “On  The Runway” portion of the checklist by calling for the flaps to be set to 15°.  The Pilot Not Flying  (PNF)  will  then  set  the  flaps  to  15°,  neutralize  the  elevator  trim,  and  retract  the spoilers  (if  applicable).    The  PNF  will  state,  “Flaps  15,  trim  set,  spoilers  retracted, throttles.”  The PF will simultaneously advance the PCLs towards the takeoff setting and   70  AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015 state, “Set Power.”  The PNF will refine the power setting to achieve the briefed torque setting and call “Power Set.” 9.8.1.3.  Based  on  Takeoff  and  Landing  Data  (TOLD),  the  PF  will  clearly  identify  a decision  point  to  continue  a  touch-and-go  versus  full  stop  to  ensure  adequate  runway length remaining. 9.8.2.  Wet  Runways.    Stop-and-go  or  touch-and-go  operations  are  prohibited  when crosswinds exceed 75% of the crosswind limitations listed in the POH. 9.8.3.  Icy Runways.  Stop-and-go or touch-and-go operations are prohibited on icy runways. 9.8.4.  Ceiling and visibility must be at least 300 feet and ¾ mile (Runway Visibility Range (RVR) 40).  (T-1) 9.9.  NVG  Operations.  NVG  training  illumination  requirements  are  the  same  as  outlined  in Chapter 5.  NVG instrument approach weather minimums are the minimums for the approach.  (T-1) AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015   71  Chapter 10 LOCAL OPERATING PROCEDURES 10.1.  General. 10.1.1.  Units will publish local and unique unit operating procedures. 10.1.2.  These procedures will not be less restrictive than items contained in this or extracted from other AFIs. 10.1.3.  Copies  of  this  Standard  Operating  Procedures  (SOP)  will  be  distributed  to  all affected aircrew members.  Forward these SOPs to HQ MAJCOM/A3V.   72  AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015 Chapter 11 LOADMASTER SPECIFIC OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES 11.1.  General.  In  addition  to  the  duties  established  in  the  AFM,  the  loadmaster  will  comply with the procedures and duties in this instruction.  These items need not be briefed and will be performed as normal procedures.  The PIC may assign other duties as necessary.  When required as part of the crew, the loadmaster will: 11.1.1.  Plan  loads,  handle  troops  and  passengers,  prepare  equipment  for  airdrop,  and supervise loading, tie-down, and offloading of cargo, baggage, and mission equipment. 11.1.2.  Participate in the aerial delivery of equipment, supplies, and personnel. 11.1.3.  Be assigned to the crew on tactical missions and support missions carrying cargo or passengers as indicated by the AF Form 4327A. 11.1.4.  Perform checklists initiated by the PF or PNF. 11.1.5.  Assist the pilot in obstacle and terrain clearance during flight and ground operations. 11.1.6.  Refuel the aircraft if maintenance personnel are not available. 11.1.7.  Perform any other ground or in-flight duties as briefed by the PIC. 11.1.8.  Perform scanner duties during flight in high threat environments. 11.2.  Responsibilities of Aircraft Loading: 11.2.1.  Normally  all  airfreight,  fleet  service,  and  servicing  personnel  are  authorized  to perform  assigned  duties  in  all  AFSOC  aircraft  when  escorted  by  an  authorized  individual.  Airfreight personnel are responsible for completion of cargo documentation, palletizing, and movement of cargo to and from the aircraft.  They will advise the crew of destination, size, weight, and type of cargo (classified, hazardous,  etc.);  coordinate traffic  activities that may affect  loading  and  offloading;  and  assign  sufficient  air  freight  loading  personnel  for  cargo handling.    Airfreight  personnel  are  responsible  for  safe  positioning  of  material  handling equipment and cargo to or from the aircraft.  Air freight personnel, under the direction of the crew,  load,  tie-down,  and  offload  the  cargo.    They  also  assist  in  stowing  the  loading equipment.    If  cargo,  aircraft  equipment,  or  aircraft  structure  is  damaged  during  loading  or offloading,  or  loading  personnel  are  injured,  the  crew  will  assure  the  aircraft  commander, command post, or terminal operations officer is notified. 11.2.2.  As part of the crew and when directed by the PIC, the loadmaster is responsible  for aircraft preflight, load planning, preparation of weight and balance form, operation of aircraft equipment, supervision and direction of loading, offloading, tie-down, and coordination with loading crew supervisor for checking the cargo against manifests.  The loadmaster supervises loading and is responsible for safe movement of cargo into and out of the aircraft. 11.2.3.  At  locations  with  no  air  terminal  or  traffic  personnel,  the  shipper  assumes responsibilities listed in Paragraph 11.2.1. 11.2.4.  Mission  requirements  will  dictate  the  configuration  of  the  aircraft.    The  loadmaster will use sound judgment in determining seat requirements. AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015   73  11.2.4.1.  The  loadmaster  will  verify  proper  aircraft  configuration  required  for  mission purposes.    The  loadmaster  will  coordinate  configuration  during  pre-mission  planning.  Ensure the following equipment, as required, is aboard the aircraft when deploying from home station:  airsickness bags, earplugs, and piddle packs. 11.2.5.  Refer  to  the  C-145A    POH  for  the  weights  of  all  aircraft  equipment  (i.e., seats/supporting jack). 11.2.6.  AFSOC aircraft do not routinely airlift channel cargo; however, if so tasked, contact the  Air  Terminal  Operations  Center  (ATOC),  Airlift  Control  Element  (ALCE),  or  air freight/passenger service to obtain the cargo and passenger breakdown and assist in planning of proposed load.  Security requirements for ammunition and weapons will be briefed to the loadmaster  during  the  initial  load  briefing  at  ATOC.    At  stations  where  aircraft  tie-down equipment is exchanged, make every effort to ensure that a one-for-one exchange occurs.  If this  is  not  possible,  the  loadmaster  will  inform  the  AC  of  lost  or  missing  equipment  and replace equipment upon returning to home station.  (T-3) 11.3.  Emergency Exits and Safety Aisles.  Load aircraft in such a manner that emergency exits are available as follows (T-1): 11.3.1.  At least one cabin emergency exit is unobstructed. 11.3.2.  At  least  one  unobstructed  emergency  exit  is  available  for  each  10  passengers  or troops.  Seats erected across an emergency exit are not considered an obstruction. 11.3.3.  Access  to  the  rear  of  the  aircraft,  entry  into  cargo  or  baggage  areas,  or  emergency exits must be maintained without exception. 11.4.  Air  Cargo  Restraint  Criteria.  Cargo  will  be  restrained  IAW  the  POH  and  this instruction during infil/exfil operations. 11.5.  Preflight  Duties.  When  designated,  the  loadmaster  will  normally  report  to  the  aircraft immediately after the crew briefing or as directed by the aircraft  commander to begin preflight and/or loading duties. 11.6.  Passenger  Handling.  Loadmasters  will  ensure  all  passengers  are  manifested.    Give  one copy to the PIC for filing and retain sufficient copies for border clearance.  The loadmaster will complete  antihijacking  requirements  for  personnel  IAW  this  instruction.    Ensure  all  classified equipment is not visible prior to passenger boarding.  When part of the crew, the loadmaster is the  key  figure  for  good  passenger  relations.    Be  aware  of  the  concerns  that  may  arise  in  the minds of passengers and anticipate their questions and actions. 11.6.1.  Passengers  may  move  about  the  cargo  compartment.    Good  judgment  must  be exercised  on  the  number  of  passengers  allowed  out  of  their  seats  at  one  time.    Encourage passengers to keep seat belts fastened when seated. 11.6.2.  Do not allow passengers to lounge on or tamper with equipment, cargo, or baggage. 11.6.3.  Ensure  classified  equipment  remains  covered  during  the  entire  mission  when passengers are on board and ensure passengers are denied access to this equipment.  (T-3) 11.7.  Troop Movements.  Every effort should be made to advise troops of mission progress or deviations.  The troop commander will be identified prior to boarding.   74  AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015 11.7.1.  Determine  if  the  troop  commander  has  any  special  requirements  prior  to  departure, and advise the aircraft commander of these requirements if appropriate. 11.7.2.  Determine  if  specific  communications  requirements  exist  and  coordinate  these requirements with the PIC. 11.7.3.  Determine if there is  a need for the troops to  perform  any type  of in-flight  rigging.  Ensure  the  aircraft  is  loaded  to  accommodate  in-flight  rigging  if  required.    Inform  the  PIC prior to in-flight rigging.  If turbulence is anticipated, the PIC should inform the  passengers in advance if possible. 11.7.4.  Ensure  troops  do  not  have  access  to  classified  equipment  during  the  mission.    If troops require access to classified equipment, the requirement should be made known to the PIC prior to the mission.  (T-3) 11.8.  Border  Clearance.  Customs,  Immigration,  and  Agriculture  require  certain  forms  for border  clearance.    If  part  of  the  crew,  the  loadmaster  will  ensure  that  required  forms  are contained in  the  aircraft  mission kit.  Distribute the forms  to  the  crew, ensure their  completion prior to landing, and deliver them to the proper persons. 11.9.  Weight and Balance.  Weight and balance for the aircraft is accomplished in accordance with TO 1-1B-50, Weight and Balance, and the POH, FAA approved aircraft loading instructions or this instruction. 11.9.1.  A  basic  handbook  of  weight  and  balance,  containing  current  aircraft  status,  is maintained  by  the  unit  possessing  the  aircraft  which  provides  a  supplemental  weight  and balance  handbook  for  each  aircraft.    The  loadmaster  will  carry  any  additional  weight  and balance documentation necessary for the planned mission. 11.9.2.  Compute  weight  and  balance  by  using  the  moments  method  or  the  approved spreadsheet. 11.9.3.  The weight and balance section of the unit possessing the aircraft is responsible for providing  the  appropriate  agency  with  information  required  to  keep  documents  current  and accurate. 11.10.  Fuel  Weight  Computation.  Use  the  most  accurate  method  available  to  compute  total fuel weight. 11.11.  Loadmaster  Forms:  DD  Form  2131,  Passenger  Manifest,  AF  Form  463,  Cargo Manifest,  DD  Form  1854,  US  Customs  Accompanied  Baggage  Declaration,  CF  7507,  General Declaration  (Outward/Inward),  I-94,  Immigration  Form,  Immigration  and  Naturalization Service Arrival/Departure Record, (accountable form), AF Form 127, Traffic Transfer Receipt, DD Form 365-4, Weight and Balance Clearance Form F (or the POH approved form). 11.12.  TOLD Cards and Computation.  Loadmasters will not compute TOLD for the C-145A.  (T-3) AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015   75  Chapter 12 AIRLAND TACTICAL PROCEDURES Section 12A—Mission Planning 12.1.  General.  Missions  may  be  long-range  with  the  low-level  portion  commencing  before reaching  the  target  area,  or  short  to  medium  range  with  the  entire  mission  being  flown  at  low-level.  This chapter deals with mission en route procedures prior to reaching the target/objective area. 12.2.  Weather  Requirements.  Weather must be VFR in compliance with AFI 11-202, Vol 3, for all tactical operations except for NVG Instrument Approaches.  (T-1) 12.3.  Altimeter  Settings.  Use  the  best  available  altimeter  setting.    If  the  current  altimeter setting is not known, set altimeters to the minimum setting briefed for the mission. 12.4.  Minimum  En  Route  Time.  En route flight time from takeoff to time over target (TOT) will be sufficient to safely accomplish all required checklists.  For airdrops involving personnel, the PIC and jumpmaster must coordinate an en route time that meets mission objectives. 12.5.  En Route Airspeeds: 12.5.1.  High-Altitude.  Some missions include a high-altitude portion of  flight  prior to  and after penetration of the target area.  En route airspeeds must be planned to provide the crew with the flexibility necessary to compensate for in-flight factors such as weather deviations, avoidance  of  reported  and  unreported  ground  or  air  threats,  and  unexpected  head  or  tail winds. 12.5.2.  Low-Altitude.  Arrival of the aircraft over the specific target at a designated time will be within ± 2 minutes.  Gaining or losing significant amounts of time at low-level has proven to be highly undesirable.  The gain or loss of time should be accomplished prior to low-level so that planned low-level entry time is achieved. 12.6.  En Route Altitudes: 12.6.1.  High  Level.    The  selected  altitude  will  depend  upon  factors  such  as  fuel consumption,  traffic  control  separation,  radar  capabilities,  threats,  terrain  factors,  and meteorological data. 12.6.2.  Low-Level.    The  selected  altitude  depends  upon  factors  such  as  threats,  moon illumination,  equipment  limitations,  weather,  and  terrain/cultural  features.    Fly  the  highest altitude commensurate with detection and threat using the following criteria: 12.6.2.1.  Day VMC/Night VMC with NVGs.  Maintain a minimum of 300 feet (500 feet in mountainous terrain) AGL modified contour altitude above the terrain by reference to the terrain and radar altimeter.  In mountainous terrain or periods of low visibility, crews may want to consider segmenting MSL altitudes along the route of flight to insure terrain clearance.  (T-1) 12.6.2.2.  Night  VMC  (Non-NVG).    Minimum  altitude  is  MSA.    When  the  altitude  for the  next  leg  or  segment  is  higher  that  the  altitude  currently  being  flown,  complete  the climb prior to the turn point or segment.  When the altitude for the next leg or segment is   76  AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015 lower than the current altitude, do not initiate descent until established on the new leg or segment.  (T-1) 12.6.2.3.  Minimum  Safe  Altitude  (MSA).    MSA  will  be  computed  and  annotated  for each leg, route segment,  or entire low-level  route.  MSA provides terrain clearance and limited threat avoidance during situations interrupting low-level operations.  To compute MSA, for each leg or leg segment, add 500 feet to the highest obstacle, contour line, or terrain feature, within 3 nm of route centerline or the planned flight path, rounded up to the next 100 feet increment.  (T-1) 12.6.2.4.  Emergency Safe Altitude (ESA).  ESA is an altitude that will provide positive terrain  clearance  in  any  weather  condition  during  situations  requiring  exiting  the  low-level environment.  To compute ESA, add 1,000 feet (2,000 feet in mountainous terrain) to the highest obstacle, contour line, or terrain feature within 10 nm of route centerline or planned  flight  path,  rounded  up  to  the  next  100  feet  increment.    Use  of  area  ESAs  is recommended whenever possible; however, a single ESA is sufficient when there are no significant changes in topography.  ESA will be annotated on all flight charts.  (T-1) 12.7.  Mission  Planning.  Ideally,  the  day  prior  to  flying  should  be  allocated  for  mission planning.  Designate the crew members required to participate.  They should be exempted from other duties so their full attention will be on the mission.  Identify individual responsibilities to efficiently use the time available.  Unit training missions and exercises should involve real world scenarios from planning to debrief.  Plan for the current mission requirements and then plan for the  "worst  case"  situation  (i.e.,  max  gross  weight,  adverse  winds,  abnormal  fuel  consumption, enemy compromise, downed aircraft etc.). 12.7.1.  Mission Feasibility.  Prior to conducting comprehensive tactical mission planning, a planning  staff  determines  if  the  mission  can  be  completed.    This  must  be  accomplished rapidly,  as  this  mission  feasibility  outcome  will  determine  the  go/no-go  decision  from  the tasking agency. 12.7.2.  Mission Preparation.  In preparation for mission planning, attempt to obtain as much as possible of the following: 12.7.2.1.  High  quality  imagery  of  target  area  and  landing  zone.    This  facilitates  final approach/departure planning, LZ recognition, and single engine escape routes. 12.7.2.2.  Landing surface dimensions, obstacles, and surface conditions. 12.7.2.3.  Moisture  at  the  LZ  or  any  other  meteorological  element  that  might  affect landing surface weight bearing capability. 12.7.2.4.  Threats.    Use  terrain  delimited  intelligence  products  to  plan  threat  avoidance and compliance with the Air Order of Battle (AOB), Ground Order of Battle (GOB), or other mission related information. 12.7.2.5.  Assemble as many different charts and photographs of the area of operations as possible.  As a minimum, the following three charts are required when available. 12.7.2.5.1.  VFR  Sectional  or  Tactical  Pilotage  Chart  (TPC)  1:500,000.    The  VFR sectional is consulted because it is updated more frequently than the Joint Operations Graphic  (JOG).    It  also  provides  accurate  information  on  controlled  airspace,  major towers, airports, beacons, and power lines as well as current magnetic variation.  The AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015   77  sectional should normally not be used for low-level flying as its scale does not allow sufficient detail for accurate pilotage, and is relatively cluttered, unless JOGs are not available. 12.7.2.5.2.  Joint Operations Graphic (JOG) 1:250,000.  The JOG or equivalent is the primary chart for planning and flying the en route portion of the mission.  The scale provides for a relatively small chart, uncluttered with extraneous information.  It has latitude/longitude and Universal  Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates, and when properly prepared, is compatible with night flight. 12.7.2.5.3.  Tactical  1:50,000  or  larger.    The  tactical  chart  (1:50,000)  is  used  to accurately locate and confirm unique map features and to transfer them to the JOG.  It displays more detail in those areas, which may be difficult to interpret on the JOG.  It should  be  used  for  the  run  in  from  Initial  Points  (IPs)  to  LZ/DZ.    Consider  using geological  survey  charts  if  1:50,000  charts  are  not  available.    Relief  charts  are  also very  helpful,  when  available.    Note:    Use  caution  when  transitioning  to  1:50,000 charts from the JOG.  The aircraft is traveling at a relatively faster rate over this chart and pilotage pacing will increase. 12.7.2.6.  Because charts rapidly become outdated, aerial photos (especially low-altitude oblique  shots)  should  be  requested  for  the  entire  route.    As  a  minimum,  a  strip  5  nm either side of centerline from the IPs to the LZ should be obtained. 12.7.2.7.  Use  demographics  and  cultural  features  to  facilitate  identifying  tactics  and operating  window.                Note:    If  these  requirements  are  not  satisfied,  additional maneuvering and reconnaissance may be required in the target area. 12.8.  Chart Preparation.  The most important aspect of chart preparation is providing the crew with  a  useable  navigational  tool  that  aids  in  mission  accomplishment.    As  such,  pilots  should annotate  their  charts  to  provide  them  with  useful  information  they  will  need  for  en  route navigation, threat avoidance, time advisories, and mission management.  Draw the route of flight on a topographic chart of 1:250,000 scale or larger.  Center symbols depicting checkpoints, IPs, objectives, and so forth on the point.  Course lines will not be drawn through these symbols.  It is absolutely  imperative  that  the  navigation  chart  be  prepared  accurately  with  extreme  care  and attention to detail.  Use one chart per mission.  The entire route of flight from departure point to recovery point should be included on a chart.  Since chart scale and route length may create large charts  unsuitable  for  the  flight  deck,  it  may  be  necessary  to  strip  charts  into  workable  sizes.  When stripped charts are used, a larger scale chart such as a sectional  should be prepared with the route and turn points to allow for major unplanned deviations during critical mission phases and  emergency  egress.    Do  not  use  the  same  chart  for  a  different  mission  in  the  same  area.  Avoid cluttering the chart.  Outline only those features that you expect to see (significant terrain contours, railroads, power lines, towers, etc.).  Although pilots may share the same chart, it is a good  technique  to  print  out  a  second  chart  for  the  loadmaster.    Annotate  the  chart  IAW Table 12.1. Table 12.1.  Chart Annotations.

Circled and labeled turn points/check points connected by course lines.  Course lines may be plotted either point-to-point or radius of turn. 12.8.2.  A circle with a diagonal line will depict emergency airfields. 12.8.3.  A line across the course line will depict the combat entry point (CEP). 12.8.4.  Annotate time marks, or distance marks, or both on the low-level course line. 12.8.5.  Magnetic  course,  leg  distance,  leg  time,  and  MSA  will  be  annotated  in  a  course arrow box (dog house) along each leg of the route.  Optional course arrow boxes can be used as long as they contain, as a minimum, the above listed information. 12.8.6.  ESA  for  the  route/route  segment  and  MSA  for  each  leg/leg  segment,  as  applicable.  ESA will be conspicuously annotated on the chart.  Draw a box around the obstruction that each MSA is based upon. 12.8.7.  When the Chart Update Manual  (CHUM) information  is  available, low-level  charts will be annotated with any added, deleted, or changed information as contained in the most recent  CHUM  or  supplement.    Charts  will  be  chummed  at  least  10  nm  either  side  of  the planned route of flight.  On the chart, individuals will annotate current CHUM, chart edition, date chart completed and ground speed chart was drawn for. 12.8.8.  Special use airspace, military training routes, and other airspace boundaries that may affect the mission within 3 nm of course centerline. 12.8.9.  Visual navigational checkpoints between turn points. 12.8.10.  Threat locations and order of battle (OB) information as applicable to the mission.  If this information is classified, the chart will be properly marked. 12.8.11.  Location of in-flight warnings. 12.8.12.  Compute  a  single  engine  service  ceiling  to  determine  if  single  engine  capability exists along the route of flight. 12.9.  Low-Level Log.  Use a low-level log to plan all low-level missions.  (T-3) AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015   79  12.9.1.  Crews  will  print  2  low-level  logs  during  all  low-level  missions.    The  log  may  be computer generated or manually prepared.  As a minimum, the log will contain the following information:  ESA for the route or route segment, name of each turn point and coordinates, and for each leg, magnetic course, distance, time, and MSA.  (T-3) 12.9.2.  The navigating pilot is encouraged to use a low-level log in-flight; however it is not a substitute for an individually prepared route chart. 12.10.  Route  and  Turn  Point  Selection.  The  route  to  and  from  the  target  area  must  be tactically sound but not so difficult as to inhibit successful navigation.  Each mission will differ and involve numerous variables.  Listed below are general rules for proper route selection. 12.10.1.  Route Selection. 12.10.1.1.  Avoid brightly-lit areas, roads, and population centers. 12.10.1.2.  Avoid planning the route near navigational aids or airports.  Hazards include other aviation operations and detection by radar oriented on these facilities. 12.10.1.3.  Plan  to  negotiate  large  north-south  valleys  on  the  upwind  side,  and  if  able, also on the moonlit side.  This helps avoid turbulence and shadows cast by the moon, and permits silhouetting of terrain features for navigation. 12.10.1.4.  Plan  to  negotiate  narrow  valleys  and  passes  in  an  east-west  or  west-east direction  (depending  on  where  the  moon  is)  so  the  terrain  will  be  visible  and  shadows avoided. 12.10.1.5.  To  the  maximum  extent  possible,  avoid  planning  a  route  that  heads  directly into  a  low  angle  rising  or  setting  moon.    Alter  the  course,  as  necessary,  to  fly  a  zigzag course when left with no alternatives. 12.10.1.6.  To  the  maximum  extent  possible,  select  intermediate  reference  points  (e.g., power lines, towers, roads,  rivers, ponds, railroads, etc.) along  each leg  of the  route  for course confirmation and timing.  Computing hard times for each of these points is time consuming, but valuable.  This provides rapid feedback on time status, which enables the crew to more easily recover in case of a late departure or mission time of arrival (TOA) changes. 12.10.1.7.  If  possible,  plan  to  cross  major  roads,  railroads,  and  rivers  at  large  angles (90°) in order to reduce exposure time.  Avoid flying an en route segment, which follows lines of communication. 12.10.1.8.  If it is impossible to avoid flight near population centers or major roads, and the area is hostile or compromising, consider flying that leg at a higher airspeed in order to reduce exposure time. 12.10.1.9.  Anticipate  power  lines/wires  being  located  near  roads,  towers,  and  buildings in open fields.  Warn the pilot of upcoming power lines, towers, and other obstructions. 12.10.1.10.  Plan alternate routes and cut-offs in the event the primary route is unusable due  to  weather,  enemy  compromise,  mission  TOA  changes,  late  departures,  etc.    It  is especially  important  to  plan  alternate  run-ins  in  case  of  runway  change  or  enemy compromise at the original IPs.  Mission planning and adherence to the planned route of flight  is  critical  to  the  success  of  low-level  operations.    Flying  off  centerline  may  be   80  AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015 necessary  for  more  effective  terrain  masking  or  to  avoid  populated  areas  or  known threats.    These  adjustments  should  be  made  during  mission  planning,  if  possible.  Aircrews  may  deviate  from  planned  route  in-flight  due  to  unforeseen  factors.    Keep deviations to the minimum required.  Maintain position awareness at all times. 12.10.2.  Turn Point Selection.  After a general route has been determined, select turn points to  control  movement  and  time  along  the  route.    Study  the  turn  points  carefully  using  all available charts and photos.  Listed below are general rules for turn point selection. 12.10.2.1.  Turn  points  should  be  unique  natural  or  man-made  features  which  are detectable at a distance.  Avoid features that are only visible when directly overhead (e.g., a small bridge in heavy vegetation or a small road crossing in the forest). 12.10.2.2.  Turn points should  contrast  with  the surrounding terrain.   Small  paved roads are poor features to use in terrain with heavy vegetation, but provide excellent contrast in a  desert  environment.    Small  bodies  of  water  provide  very  little  contrast  in  terrain  with vegetation, but contrast well in the desert. 12.10.2.3.  Avoid selecting turn points near towns as the town will invariably  grow  and may  make  detection  of  the  turn  point  difficult.    Additionally,  overflying  towns  may compromise the security of the mission. 12.10.2.4.  Turn points should not be in the vicinity of bright lights. 12.10.2.5.  Turn points should be confirmed by using a prominent feature along the route and close to the turn point. 12.10.2.6.  Consider  the  moon  angle  and  illumination.    The  turn  point  should  not  fall within  the  shadow  cast  by  nearby  terrain  features.    A  moon  in  front  of  the  aircraft  will make turn point identification difficult. 12.10.2.7.  Try to select prominent barriers near turn points.  It is often better to discard a good turn point with  no  barrier in  favor of a more difficult  turn point with  an excellent barrier. 12.10.2.8.  The  first  and  last  turn  points  of  the  route  are  the  most  important.    An  easily identifiable feature should be used even if the flight route must be altered slightly.  This helps  ensure  positive  location  and  timing.    When  planning  an  IP,  allow  enough  time  to get the aircraft configured and stable for the approach, but not so much time that drift or enemy compromise become limiting factors. 12.10.2.9.  If possible, LZs should have an IP that aligns the run-in with the runway axis.  However, a good IP is more important than an exact alignment with the runway heading.  If the threat environment allows, consider conducting a "270" maneuver.  This maneuver allows for  IPs 90°off runway axis,  and for an  "unaided"  LZ, easier identification of the landing area.  Allow ample time to complete the maneuver in planning. 12.10.2.10.  In varying terrain, make note of the MSL altitude at each turn point to aid in turn point identification.  This technique is especially valuable in mountainous terrain. 12.11.  Crew Briefing.  It is imperative that a complete and detailed crew briefing is conducted prior to low-level flight.  This briefing is normally conducted by the navigating pilot, and covers as a minimum the following items: AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015   81  12.11.1.  ESA and the determining obstacle. 12.11.2.  Alternate airfields. 12.11.3.  Combat entry point. 12.11.4.  The location of in-flight warnings. 12.11.5.  For each leg, the course, distance, time, MSA and significant terrain or threats. 12.11.6.  The objective area.  Review the survey and any aerial photography or tactical charts (1:50,000) available and brief the following items: 12.11.6.1.  For  an  LZ,  brief  the  runway  orientation,  the  run-in  orientation,  the  LZ dimensions, significant obstacles, expected markings, planned point of touchdown and its coordinates,  go-around  point,  escape  route  in  the  event  of  a  balked  landing,  emergency procedures, and compare LZ length to performance data for landing and for takeoff. 12.11.6.2.  For  a  DZ,  brief  the  DZ  orientation,  its  dimensions,  significant  obstacles, expected  markings,  point  of  impact  and  its  coordinates,  escape  route,  type  of  drop, altitude,  green  light  time,  computed  air  release  point  (CARP)  or  high-altitude  release point (HARP), and emergency procedures. 12.11.7.  Action to follow (i.e., combat exit point, subsequent low-level route). 12.11.8.  Pilots will brief emergency actions for loss of NVGs during critical phases of flight (takeoffs, landings, airdrops, etc.).  Specific procedures are at the PIC‘s discretion. 12.12.  In-Flight Aircrew Procedures. 12.12.1.  When  setting  the  radar  altimeter,  set  the  altitude  clearance  markers  to  90%  of  the desired route altitude.  Activation of the low-altitude warning system indicates the aircraft is too low and an immediate correction is necessary.  Any crew member noting a low-altitude warning  light  will  announce  “low”.    The  PF  will  acknowledge  the  “low”  call  and  begin  a climb to the correct altitude.  (T-1) 12.12.2.  Updating  the  aircraft’s  navigation  system.    Updating  the  Garmin  GPS  is  not normally  needed  in-flight.    If  loss  of  the  GPS  signal  occurs,  consider  using  nearby NAVAIDS to verify position. 12.12.3.  Turns  are  normally  made  at  the  turn  point;  however,  terrain  masking  may  require turning at an offset turn point.  When the turn point cannot be located visually, the turn will be initiated when: 12.12.4.  At  the  preplanned  linear  boundary,  the  leg  time  elapsed,  or  the  aircraft  navigation system distance-to-go stops decreasing. 12.12.5.  GPS Procedures.  C-145A aircrews may use the GPS/FMS for situational awareness and as a backup to visual navigation while flying low-level missions.  The GPS will normally have  the  DZ/LZ  coordinates  input  in  the  system.    Due  to  the  time  consuming  nature  of manually  entering  user  waypoints,  the  PIC  may  elect  to  not  input  any  or  all  turn  points.  Aircrews  may  also  use  portable  GPS  units  (PGUs)  in  accordance  with  AFI  11-202,  Vol  3.  PGUs should be connected to aircraft power and properly grounded.  Ensure system use and operation does not interfere with navigation or aircraft control.  (T-2)   82  AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015 12.12.6.  Emergency Procedures. 12.12.6.1.  Disorientation.    When  a  crew  becomes  disoriented,  immediately  establish your position by identifying a prominent terrain feature or landmark. 12.12.6.1.1.  Climb  to  the  ESA  during  IMC  or  MSA  if  in  VMC.    Maintain  this altitude until positively fixing your position.  While higher altitudes will increase the field of view and reduce the terrain hazard, it also exposes the aircraft to threats. 12.12.6.1.2.  After obtaining a positive fix, descend and resume low-level operations.  Cross-check the timing and make any necessary adjustments. 12.12.6.1.3.  Terrain,  threat,  weather,  controlled  airspace,  and  mission  are  factors  to consider  when  executing  an  emergency  climb.    The  aircraft  commander  must consider each of these factors prior to his decision to make an emergency climb.  To execute an emergency climb, set power towards 85%, props toward 1700 RPM, and climb at 100 KIAS to a safe altitude. 12.12.6.2.  Engine-Out Operations: 12.12.6.2.1.  Discontinue low-level if feasible. 12.12.6.2.2.  If  low-level  flying  is  necessary,  fly  the  appropriate  minimum  safe altitude.    If  in  a  threat  environment,  fly  as  high  as  the  threat  will  allow.    Ensure aircraft is capable of clearing terrain along route of flight with engine out.  (T-1) 12.12.7.  Overwater  Low-Level  Procedures.    When  descending  into  an  overwater  low-level environment,  the  water  may  not  be  visible  until  approximately  100  feet  above  water  level (AWL).  To decrease the chance of impacting the water, match the descending vertical speed (i.e., vertical speed or velocity indicator – VSI or VVI) to the height above the water.  The PNF will backup the PF by monitoring VVI and altimeters. 12.12.8.  En Route Airspeed.  During night low-level operations, the crew must remain alert and be prepared to  react properly in  the event  of an emergency, particularly  engine failure.  To help provide a margin of safety, fly the low-level route in accordance with the following procedures (not applicable to contingencies): 12.12.8.1.  Normal  en  route  airspeed  is  planned  at  150  kts  ground  speed,  but  should  be adjusted as the situation requires.  This number equates to a ground speed of 2.5 nm/min.  The  Garmin  530/430  will  display  ground  speed  and  ground  track  making  it  easier  for navigating pilots to provide timely airspeed and course corrections to the PF. 12.12.8.2.  Minimum  airspeed  is  best  rate  of  climb  airspeed  (Vy),  or  best  rate  of  climb single engine (Vyse) if applicable, with flaps up, and best angle of climb speed (Vx), or best angle of climb speed single engine (Vxse) if applicable, with flaps set at approach or take-off settings. 12.12.8.3.  When  minimum  airspeeds  results  in  excessive  groundspeed,  use  offset maneuvering or orbits around the turn point to control en route time. 12.13.  Aircrew Duties.  Specific duties are: AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015   83  12.13.1.  Pilot  Flying.    Primarily  responsible  for  terrain  clearance,  heading,  and  airspeed.  Obstruction  avoidance  area  of  responsibility  is  immediately  ahead  and  to  their  side  of  the aircraft. 12.13.2.  Pilot  Not  Flying.    Primarily  responsible  for  navigation  and  time  control.  Obstruction  avoidance  area  of  responsibility  is  immediately  ahead  and  to  their  side  of  the aircraft.    Provide  the  turn  point  brief  to  include  new  magnetic  course,  distance,  MSA, description  of  turn  point,  and  significant  terrain  description.    The  PF  will  acknowledge  the new magnetic course and MSA.  The turn point briefing and course acknowledgment must be completed prior to the turn point so as not to distract the crew from positively identifying the turn  point.    Both  pilots  should  reset  their  heading  markers  to  the  new  course  when  able.  Monitor the pilot’s airspeed, heading and bank angle as a back-up.  Primarily responsible for all radio  calls after the CEP.        Note:  During low-level operations, the pilots must be in their seats at all times.  If either pilot must leave the seat, climb to the appropriate MSA prior to leaving the seat.  (T-2)      Exception:  If a qualified IP is at a set of controls, the aircraft may maintain low-level altitudes. 12.13.3.  Loadmaster.   Primarily  responsible  for  cargo  compartment  operations  and equipment contained in cargo compartment.  Duties include but are not limited to operation of  assigned  radios,  laptop  systems  and  scanner  duties.    Mission  radios/laptop  may  be assigned to  the PNF by  exception (i.e., during phases of flight  when the loadmaster cannot operate equipment), as long as the PNF can perform duties from their assigned crew position. 12.13.3.1.  During  INFIL/EXFIL  operations,  the  loadmaster  will  provide  mandatory egress  training to  all personnel  carried on the mission.  Training will normally occur in conjunction  with  static  load  training.    When  able,  conduct  egress  drills  during  both daylight and blacked out conditions.  The following areas will be covered (T-2): 12.13.3.2.  Location and use of emergency exits and hatches.  All personnel will practice the use of emergency exits. 12.13.3.3.  Location of crash axe/chopping locations, fire extinguishers, first aid kit, and life rafts. 12.13.3.4.  Location of egress assembly areas. 12.13.3.5.  Emergency warning signals. 12.13.3.6.  Danger  areas  to  include  engines,  propellers,  ALE-40  flare  dispensers,  radar, pitot tubes, hot brakes, etc. 12.14.  Navigating to Landing Zones/Drop Zones.  Some missions may require operations into unmarked and uncontrolled LZ/DZs.  Mission effectiveness depends upon detailed intelligence, extensive aircrew planning  and study, precision en route navigation,  time control, accurate  and timely LZ/DZ recognition, and positive aircrew coordination. 12.14.1.  Markings.  LZ/DZs are marked IAW the guidance provided in this instruction and AFI 13217, Drop Zone and Landing Zone Operations, and the AFSOC Supplement.  (T-1) 12.14.2.  Training.    Aircrews  will  normally  use  AMP-3  with  covert  lighting  or  AMP-4 markings for training.   84  AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015 12.14.3.  Fuel  Planning.    The  chance  of  a  successful  navigation  to  an  unmarked  LZ/DZ decreases when equivalent moon illumination is less than 10% or there is little or no contrast between the LZ/DZ and surrounding area.  When navigating to an unmarked LZ/DZ and the illumination  is  less  than  10%,  TOT  is  prior  to  moonrise,  or  TOT  is  after  moonset,  plan  20 minutes  of  additional  fuel  at  max  continuous  power  to  account  for  potential  difficulties  in acquiring the DZ/LZ. 12.15.  Landing Zone Surveys. 12.15.1.  All LZs must be surveyed in accordance with AFI 13-217.  (T-1) 12.15.2.  HQ  AFSOC/A3,  or  designated  representative,  is  the  approval  authority  for  all unpublished  surveys.    HQ  AFSOC/A3  or  designated  representative  is  also  the  waiver authority for LZ criteria and survey requirements.  (T-2) 12.16.  Terminal Area Landing Procedures: 12.16.1.  Initial Approach.  When pre-mission intelligence requirements are not satisfied for LZs, or if human or animal traffic is expected near or on the LZ, additional maneuvering and reconnaissance  may  be  required  in  the  target  area.    Perform  reconnaissance  maneuvering with  approach  flaps.                    Note:    During  operational  training,  aircraft  must  be  stabilized, aligned with the runway from 100 feet AGL on final to touchdown or a go-around must be accomplished.  (T-2)           Note:  If the PF determines that the actual touchdown point is going  to  be  different  than  what  was  briefed,  the  PF  must  verbalize  the  updated  touchdown point. 12.16.2.  Communications.    If  landing  clearance  or  go-around  signals  are  to  be  given  via radio,  two-way  communications  with  the  reception  committee  must  be  established  prior  to landing.    If  comm-out  procedures  are  used,  presence  of  a  pre-briefed  signal  constitutes clearance  to  land.    A  signal  must  be  pre-briefed  to  direct  a  go-around.    Radio  clearance  to land is the primary method when more than one aircraft is using the LZ. 12.17.  Aircraft Preparation. 12.17.1.  General.  Aircraft are normally configured for tactical operations prior to departure.  The  aircraft  may  be  configured  while  airborne  by  exception  to  meet  operational  needs.  When configuring the aircraft for tactical operation while airborne, the crew will determine a minimum safe altitude dictated by terrain and threat. 12.17.2.  Emission Control (EMCON).  Effective EMCON requires a basic understanding of the capabilities, limitations, deployment patterns, and Integrated Air Defense System (IADS) interface  of  the  principle  enemy  systems.    All  aircraft  emissions  must  be  considered  to include radar, communications, and flares.  Aircraft lighting (both internal and external) and acoustical signature can be passively detected.  Aircrews must make EMCON an integral part of overall operational plans and tactical operations. 12.17.3.  The  LM  will  attach  chemical  lights  near  each  exit  when  performing  infil/exfil training or during contingencies with a user on board.  During all other flights, they may be attached at the LM’s discretion.  Chemical sticks should be taped to allow a small amount of light  to  shine  through.                WARNING:    Chemical  lights  attached  to  exit  doors  and emergency escape hatch handles will remain in place until mission completion. AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015   85  Chapter 13 AIRDROP PROCEDURES 13.1.  General.  This  chapter  establishes  procedures,  regulatory  guidance  and  limitations  for airdrop  for  the  C-145A.    This  guidance  should  be  used  in  conjunction  with  other  directives.  Sound  judgment  should  be  used  to  resolve  conflicts  that  may  arise  between  this  and  other guidance. 13.1.1.  Airdrop  Communications.    After  calling  the  10-minute  warning,  the  LM  may  clear off interphone, with PIC approval, to don appropriate equipment and inspect the airdrop load.  After  completing  the  10-minute  checklist,  the  primary  LM  will  remain  on  interphone throughout the remainder of the airdrop.  (T-2) 13.1.1.1.  Training Operations.  Radio transmissions with the DZ are required for safety of  flight  considerations  or  factors  effecting  airborne  force  employment.    This  includes ATC  directions,  range  clearance,  unsafe  surface  conditions  or  mission  changes.    When practicing radio silence procedures, transmission of wind information and range or drop clearance is not required.  Radio silence procedures will be coordinated prior to mission execution.  (T-2) 13.1.1.2.  Drop clearance is normally inherent with mission clearance to unmanned DZs.  The  aircrew  observing  the  proper  briefed  authentication  confirms  drop  clearance  in VMC.  A no-drop or mission cancellation is communicated by the absence of pre-briefed markings (visual or electronic), jumbled block letter, observation of the block letter X, or red smoke, light, or flare. 13.1.1.3.  In  general,  outside  the  one  minute  advisory,  any  crew  member  seeing  a deviation or dangerous condition developing shall report the situation to the PIC.  Inside the  one  minute  advisory,  any  crew  member  seeing  an  unsafe  deviation  or  dangerous situation  developing  will  call  “no-drop.”  The  PF,  the  PNF,  and  the  LM  will  all acknowledge the “no-drop” call.  The PIC will determine the feasibility of continuing or ceasing airdrop operations.  If the PIC chooses to use different criteria, these criteria will be briefed during the pre-mission briefing.  (T-2) 13.2.  Low Cost Low-Altitude (LCLA) Airdrop. 13.2.1.  The LCLA, or equivalent sized bundle, is the primary resupply bundle type dropped by the C-145A. 13.2.2.  Each LCLA bundle can weigh up to 800 pounds total rigged weight. 13.2.3.  The  maximum  skid  board  size  for  an  LCLA  bundle  is  1  inch  thick,  grade  AC plywood cut 48 inches long by 36 inches wide by 47 inches high.  Items placed on the skid board will not protrude over or outside the maximum width or length of the skid board.  The load must meet 28 PSF as a minimum.    Note:  At maximum size and weight, the C-145A can only airdrop 3 LCLA bundles at any one time. 13.2.4.  Minimum LCLA size for the C-145A is 24 inches long by 24 inches wide.  This will ensure  that  the  skid  board  will  be  in  contact  with  6  rollers  and  will  prevent  the  load  from tipping  over.    Must  still  meet  the  other  requirements  in  Paragraph  13.2.3.                    Note:    86  AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015 LCLA  bundles  can  be  built  to  custom  dimensions  and  configurations  for  different  type  of aircraft.  TO 13C7-1-11, Airdrop of Supplies and Equipment:  Rigging Containers, is used by qualified/authorized riggers as a basic guide for the construction of LCLA bundles; however, qualified/authorized  riggers,  in  conjunction  with  the  aircraft  primary  loadmaster,  should determine  specific  bundle  dimensions  based  on  user  requirements  and  aircraft  limitations.  Bundles may vary, during contingency operations depending on user requirements, mission necessity and bundle construction material supply availability. 13.2.5.  LCLA Procedures. 13.2.5.1.  LCLA bundles are limited to a drop altitude of 120’- 300’ AGL.  These limits are LCLA limits, and do not reflect aircraft limitations.  (T-1) 13.2.5.2.  The normal drop altitude for LCLA is 200 feet AGL.  This gives the parachute enough time to open and stabilize the load prior to impact.  Considering potential aircraft altitude deviations, do not drop lower than 120 feet AGL, which is the minimum altitude for the parachute to be effective.  (T-2) 13.2.5.2.1.  The terrain  and the threat  environment  may drive a higher drop altitude; however, higher altitudes negatively affect the accuracy of the LCLA system. 13.2.5.3.  The normal drop speed for LCLA is 100 KIAS.  At slower airspeeds, generally less  than  100  KIAS,  LCLA  parachutes  have  failed  to  deploy  properly.    At  airspeeds  of 130  KIAS  or  greater,  there  is  a  greatly  increased  possibility  of  parachute  failure.          Note:    The  aircraft  loadmaster  will  use  sound  judgment  to  determine  if  LCLA  bundles can be loaded, rigged and dropped.  The loadmaster will take into account aircraft safety, aircrew safety, aircraft weight and balance and bundle construction. 13.2.5.4.  For  LCLA  bundles  use  Type  VIII  nylon  webbing  as  the  primary  release  gate.  As  a  minimum,  ensure  the  nylon  webbing  has  at  least  1  1/2  turns  on  the  Van  Zelm ratchet.  The gate may be installed utilizing a Van Zelm ratchet on both ends of the gate, utilizing a Van Zelm ratchet on one end of the gate and three alternating half hitches with a knot in the running end on the other, or by utilizing a tie on both ends of the gate to a tie-down ring with one side using a truckers hitch and three alternating half hitches with a knot in the running end to provide tension and three alternating half hitches with a knot in the running end on the other. 13.2.5.4.1.  If  the  height  of  the  LCLA  bundle  is  less  than  24”  (excluding  the parachute)  from  the  cargo  floor,  route  the  release  gate  under  the  load  straps  to preclude the release gate from slipping over the top of the bundle. 13.2.5.5.  One 5,000 pound strap will be used for forward restraint (providing tension for the release gate), and additional 5,000 pound straps will be used for vertical restraint as necessary.    When  airdropping  more  than  one  LCLA  bundle,  each  bundle  will  have  its own 5,000 pound strap for vertical restraint.  When airdropping a mass of bundles (more than  one  bundle  on  the  same  pass),  only  one  5,000  pound  strap  is  required  for  vertical restraint. 13.2.5.5.1.  All  5,000  pound  ratchets  will  be  attached CAUTION:    Do  not  route  5,000  pound  straps  (acting  as  the  forward  restraint) through  the  LCLA  bundle  webbing.    It  is  to  provide  tension  for  the  release  gate the  aircraft to left.         AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015   87  during  the  cut  at  “Green  Light”.    Routing  the  strap  through  the  webbing  may  cause failure of the bundle to leave the aircraft. 13.2.5.6.  During preflight, the loadmaster will measure their restraint harness to preclude exiting  the  aircraft.    When  dropping  LCLAs,  the  static  lines  will  be  attached  to  the aircraft right side and harness will be connected to the aircraft left. 13.2.5.7.  The  loadmaster  will  don  their  restraint  harness  and  HGU-55/P  (lightweight flyers  helmet)  or  authorized  alternate  helmet  prior  to  calling  the  “10  Minute”  checklist complete.  (T-1) WARNING:  The loadmaster will be connected to the aircraft prior to opening  the  cargo  doors  and  when  the  door  manual  operation  handle  is  in  the  “Open” position, unless aircraft safety is threatened. 13.2.5.8.  Non-essential  mission  equipment  (go  bags,  life  rafts,  etc.)  should  be  moved clear  of  the  load  during  preflight.            Note:    The  loadmaster  will  remain  cognizant  of aircraft CG.  The aircraft may be extremely nose heavy, but still within CG limits, post drop.    It  may  be  necessary  to  relocate  weight  to  the  aft  end  of  the  aircraft,  after  all checklists have been completed, to help manage aircraft CG. 13.2.5.9.  Static  lines  will  be  attached  to  independent  5,000  pound  tie-down  rings  on aircraft  right  sidewall  at  Frame  15.    For  multiple  bundles,  use  rings  at  Frame  15  ±  six inches.    A  carabineer  should  be  used  to  connect  bundle  static  lines  (with  or  without  a clevis) to sidewall tie-down rings. 13.2.5.10.  At the “One  Minute” time advisory, the loadmaster  will be positioned to  cut the release gate.     WARNING:  The loadmaster will be positioned to preclude their gear or  any  portion  of  their  body  from  becoming  entangled  or  struck  by  the  exiting  airdrop load. 13.2.5.11.  Upon  hearing  the  “Green  Light”  call  from  the  pilot/copilot,  the  loadmaster will  perform  a  manual  gate  cut  and  call  “Load  Clear”  once  all  bundles  have  exited  the aircraft,  or  “Malfunction”  if  the  gate  fails  to  cut  or  the  load  fails  to  exit.    The  primary method of a manual gate cut will utilize a suitable J-knife/hook knife unless extraordinary circumstances exist where a J-knife/hook knife is not available. 13.2.5.11.1.  If the load is rolling slowly, the loadmaster should request an increase of deck angle from the pilot. 13.2.5.12.  Upon hearing “Load Clear” or “Malfunction”, the PNF will state “Red Light” and turn on the red light if equipped. 13.2.5.13.  The  airdrop  sequence  is  complete  once  the  airdrop  malfunction  checklist  (if required)  and  the  post-drop  checklist  have  been  completed.          Note:    During  training missions, the loadmaster should make every attempt to retrieve Dbags post drop.  During operational missions, cutting the static lines and releasing the D-bags is authorized.  An operational mission is any mission in support of combat operations. 13.2.5.13.1.  Doors  will  normally  be  closed  by  the  LM  using  the  aft  door  switch  (if configured).  If the LM is not able to close the doors, close doors from the flight deck.  If  the  doors  cannot  be  closed  by  the  flight  deck  crew,  the  loadmaster  will  manually close from the back. 13.2.6.  LCLA Malfunction Procedures.   88  AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015 13.2.6.1.  Gate fails to cut or load fails to exit aircraft: 13.2.6.1.1.  The loadmaster will call “Malfunction” and give a brief description of the problem. 13.2.6.1.2.  The  pilot  should  make  every  attempt  to  sustain  a  level  deck  angle  and avoid  turning  the  aircraft  if  at  all  possible,  depending  on  the  terrain  and  threat situation. 13.2.6.1.3.  The pilot should extend flaps, as required, to maintain desired deck angle. 13.2.6.1.4.  Due  to  the  small  CG  envelope  of  the  C-145A,  the  loadmaster  should make every attempt to free the bundle. 13.2.6.1.5.  If the loadmaster cannot  free the bundle, it should be restrained in  place and the aircraft CG should be recomputed. 13.2.6.1.6.  If possible, the cargo doors should be closed. 13.2.6.1.7.  The  loadmaster  will  call  “Malfunction  Checks  Complete”  and  perform completion  of  drop  checklist.              Note:    The  loadmaster  should  give  the  pilot  a situation report about the load (whether it was released or remains on the aircraft) and its effects on the aircraft CG. 13.3.  Free Drop. 13.3.1.  Free  drop  is  used  to  drop  non-fragile  items,  using  no  parachute  to  retard  decent  or stabilize the load. 13.3.2.  Drop  Altitude.    Normally,  free  drop  is  accomplished  at  much  lower  altitudes  than those required for other paradrops.  When possible, free drops will be made at 200 feet AGL or less, but not below 50 feet AGL.  (T-1) 13.3.3.  Drop  Zone  Size.    The  trajectory  of  the  items  being  dropped  will  determine  the  DZ size requirements.  As a rule, the DZ length required equals the altitude of the aircraft over the  release  point  a  safety  margin  of  100  feet  added  to  each  end.    Applying  this  rule,  when dropping  from  200  feet  AGL,  the  required  length  will  be  200  feet  (altitude)  plus  200  feet (safety margin) or 400 feet total.  (T-1) 13.3.4.  Free drop bundles weighing more than 200 pounds should be rigged similar to LCLA loads.    Free  drop  bundles  rigged  in  this  manner  will  use  Type  VIII  nylon  webbing  as  the primary release gate. 13.3.5.  One 5,000 pound strap will be used for  forward restraint (providing tension for the release  gate),  and  additional  5,000  pound  straps  will  be  used  for  vertical  restraint  as necessary.    When  airdropping  more  than  one  free  drop  item,  each  item  will  have  its  own 5,000 pound strap for vertical  restraint.  When airdropping  a mass of items  (more than one bundle on the same pass), only one 5,000 pound strap is required for vertical restraint. 13.3.5.1.  All 5,000 pound ratchets will be attached to the aircraft left. 13.3.6.  At  the  “One  Minute”  time  advisory,  the  loadmaster  will  be  positioned  to  cut  the release gate. AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015   89  13.3.7.  Upon  hearing  the  “Green  Light”  call  from  the  pilot/copilot,  the  loadmaster  will perform  a  manual  gate  cut  and  call  “Load  Clear”  once  all  free  drop  items  have  exited  the aircraft. 13.3.7.1.  If the load is rolling slowly, the loadmaster should request an increase of deck angle from the pilot.       WARNING:  The loadmaster will be connected to the aircraft prior to opening the cargo doors and when the cargo door manual operation handle is in the  “Open”  position,  unless  aircraft  safety  is  threatened.                    Note:    The  user  takes responsibility for damaged items. 13.3.8.  Free Drop Malfunctions. 13.3.8.1.  Load fails to exit aircraft: 13.3.8.1.1.  The loadmaster will call “Malfunction” and give a brief description of the problem. 13.3.8.1.2.  The  pilot  should  make  every  attempt  to  sustain  a  level  deck  angle  and avoid  turning  the  aircraft  if  at  all  possible,  depending  on  the  terrain  and  threat situation. 13.3.8.1.3.  The pilot will roll flaps, as required, to maintain desired deck angle. 13.3.8.1.4.  The  bundle  should  be  restrained  in  place  and  the  aircraft  CG  should  be recomputed. 13.3.8.1.5.  The primary method of closure of the cargo doors is from the flight deck.  If not able, the loadmaster will manually close from the back. 13.3.8.1.6.  The loadmaster will call “Malfunction Checks Complete” and prepare for the next phase of flight.          Note:  The loadmaster should give the pilot a situation report  about  the  load  (whether  it  was  released  or  remains  on  the  aircraft)  and  its effects on the aircraft CG. 13.4.  Personnel Airdrop. 13.4.1.  High-Altitude  Low-Opening Procedures. (HALO)/High-Altitude  High-Opening (HAHO) 13.4.1.1.  High-Altitude  Mission  Requirements.  Airdrops  conducted  above  3,000  feet AGL are considered to be high-altitude drops.  In addition to the normal mission planning requirements, the following are unique to high-altitude operations: 13.4.1.2.  Prominent  terrain  features  within  the  drop  area  should  be  selected  to  position the aircraft on the inbound course and to determine the release point. 13.4.1.3.  Preflight  weather  and  winds  must  be  analyzed  to  determine  the  most advantageous inbound course.  Whenever possible, the inbound course should be into the average wind vector. 13.4.1.4.  High-Altitude Oxygen: supplemental  oxygen  during 13.4.1.4.1.  Parachutists  may  operate  without unpressurized flight up to 13,000 feet MSL provided the elapsed time above 10,000 feet  MSL  does  not  exceed  30  minutes  per  sortie.    Under  circumstances  other  than   90  AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015 these,  jumpers  will  use  supplemental  oxygen.   Aircrew  members  will  use supplemental  oxygen  as  directed  by  AFI  11-202  ,  Vol  3  AFSOC  Supplement  1.  When  dropping  from  20,000  feet  MSL  and  higher,  the  pre-breathing  procedures described in Paragraph  13.4.1.4.2 below will be used.  When supplemental oxygen will  be  required  due  to  flight  profile,  an  oxygen  console  will  be  installed  in  the aircraft  for  crew  and  parachutists.    The  console  will  provide  sufficient  oxygen regulators for all parachutists and crew members. 13.4.1.4.2.  Pre-breathing.    All  personnel  will  pre-breathe  100%  oxygen  at  a  cabin altitude as close to sea level as possible, but not greater than 16,000 feet cabin altitude on any mission scheduled for a drop at or above 20,000 feet MSL.  Pre-breathing will be  started  so  as  to  have  the  required  pre-breathing  time  in  Table  13.1  completed before the cabin altitude ascends through 16,000 feet MSL.  A break in pre-breathing requires the pre-breathing period to be restarted or the individual whose pre-breathing was  interrupted  be  removed  from  the  flight.    Airdrop  above  25,000  feet  require  a waiver to AFI 11-202, Vol 3.  Submit waivers through HQ/AFSOC/DOV.  (T-2) 13.4.1.4.3.  Floor  Loading.    It  is  preferred  to  floor  load  jumpers  facing  aft  due  to confined space in  the cargo  compartment.   Jumpers will be restrained by one of the following methods: 1) Attaching a 5,000 lb. strap to the side floor tiedown rings, 2) Attaching a 5,000 lb. strap to the sidewall seat tracks and connecting the jumpers to it with  a  personal  restraint  lanyard,  3)  Attaching  each  personal  restraint  lanyard  to  tie down rings positioned in the sidewall seat tracks next to each jumper. Table 13.1.  Pre-Breathing Times. DROP ALTITUDE AIRCREW PARACHUTISTS At or above 20,000’ to 25,000’ 30 Minutes 30 Minutes HALO/HAHO 13.4.1.4.4.  Aerospace  Physiologist  and  Technician  (AsPO)  Requirements.    An  AsPO (AFSC  43A3,  4M0X1)  will  accompany  all  missions  operating  above  20,000  feet  MSL regardless  of  the  type  of  airdrop.    The  AsPO's  duties  will  be  to  monitor  in-flight personnel,  aircraft  and  supplemental  oxygen  equipment  and  life  support  equipment.  Preflight, as is practical, all aircraft and supplemental oxygen equipment and life support equipment.  The AsPO will advise and aid the loadmaster in positioning and securing the supplemental  equipment  used  on  the  mission.    The  AsPO  will  brief  all  aircrew  and jumpers  prior  to  the  first  mission  on  the  duties  and  responsibilities  of  the  AsPO, physiological problems that may be encountered in-flight, the importance of proper pre-breathing,  the  effects  of  wind  blast  and  cold  air  on  exposed  tissue,  and  any  special circumstances for a given mission.  The AsPO will be on interphone and will normally be positioned forward of the oxygen console (when used).  (T-1) 13.4.1.5.  HQ USAF/SGPA and HQ AFSOC/SG will be notified by the most expeditious manner of any physiological incident. 13.4.1.6.  Emergency Procedures.   If  any person experiences decompression  sickness  or unusual pain, the pilot will: 13.4.1.6.1.  Abort the mission. AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015   91  13.4.1.6.2.  Begin a descent.  The type and degree of sickness or pain will determine the descent. 13.4.1.6.3.  Proceed  to  the  nearest  base  at  which  qualified  medical  assistance  is available. 13.4.1.6.4.  Advise  the  control  tower  of  the  emergency  and  request  a  doctor  and  an ambulance to meet the aircraft. 13.5.  High-Altitude Personnel Drop (HALO/HAHO) Procedures.  HALO/HAHO operations will be jumpmaster directed unless approved by the JSOAC/CC or OG/CC.  A  HARP solution will be computed for all high-altitude personnel drops unless specific mission directives dictate otherwise. 13.5.1.  High-Altitude  Low-Opening  (HALO).    A  clandestine  method  of  inserting  military parachutists  into  an  objective  area.    Using  military  free  fall  skills,  jumpers  exit  the  aircraft from 3,000 to 25,000 feet above ground level and free fall to low-altitudes prior to manually activating  their  parachutes.    This  technique  minimizes  exposure  time  under  canopy  for  the jumpers and is a very accurate means of inserting special operations forces. 13.5.2.  High-Altitude  High-Opening  (HAHO).    A  clandestine  method  of  inserting  military parachutists into an objective area.  This tactic provides the ability to offset; that is, exit the aircraft  miles  from  an  objective  area  at  high-altitude,  activate  a  high  glide  ratio  parachute immediately,  and  glide  to  the  intended  landing  point.    This  technique  permits  minimum exposure of the aircraft and crew to enemy surface-to-air countermeasures. 13.5.3.  Flight  Planning.    In  addition  to  the  normal  flight  planning  requirements  to  position the aircraft over the target area, the following are unique to HALO/HAHO operations using the HARP. 13.5.3.1.  Detailed  instructions  for  computing  the  HARP,  including  parachute  ballistic data, are contained in AFI 11-231, Computed Air Release Point Procedures. 13.5.3.2.  Plot  the  preflight  HARP  and  ensure  the  distance  from  the  IP  to  the  preflight HARP  allows  sufficient  time  for  the  aircrew  to  verify  the  run  in,  accomplish  airdrop checklists, and if required, recompute and plot the in-flight HARP.  This should receive special consideration when performing HAHO airdrop operations. 13.5.3.3.  A  large-scale  chart  prepared  for  in-flight  use  is  highly  desirable.    This  allows the aircrew to update the in-flight HARP for a visual release. 13.5.4.  Conduct Of Operations: 13.5.4.1.  If mission requirements dictate, crews may employ low-level flight to the target area with  a climb  for HALO/HAHO operations.  This may  enable the aircrew to  obtain current  winds for updating the preflight  HARP during the climb.   High-level  flights  are also  possible  but  the  HARP  will  have  to  be  based  on  preflight  winds.    Positive identification of the drop zone area must be confirmed visually when conducting a visual HARP. 13.5.4.2.  Initial Lineup.  It is desirable that the aircraft is at drop altitude, inbound to the HARP not later than six minutes prior to the HARP.  This amount of time is necessary to update the HARP, if necessary, and position the aircraft on the correct inbound course.   92  AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015 13.5.4.3.  HARP Release.  The following methods may be used to navigate to the HARP. 13.5.4.3.1.  A  visual  drop  may  be  accomplished  whereby  the  pilot  flies  over  the HARP.  Positive identification of the drop zone area and/or HARP must be confirmed visually prior to calling the release.  Verify an offset from the point of impact, which will ensure the aircraft will track over the HARP.  Once proper alignment is obtained, pick a geographic point on the horizon and fly a drift killed heading toward this point.  Choose  a  reference  point  far  enough  from  the  DZ  to  ensure  the  point  remains  in constant view.  Selection of timing points will assist in calling the release point (green light) since the DZ will disappear under the nose of the aircraft.  Timing points should be  abeam  the  drop  zone,  prior  to  the  HARP  and  identified  prior  to  the  1  minute warning.    Cultural  features  such  as  long  straight  roads  or  railroads  make  excellent timing points. 13.5.4.3.2.  An  onboard  navigation  system  release  may  be  accomplished  when  pre-briefed and coordinated with the parachutists.  When this procedure is used, enter the IP and preflight HARP coordinates into the system.  Both pilots must confirm proper IP  and  HARP  coordinates  are  entered  into  the  system.    Comply  with  Paragraph 13.5.3.2 of this instruction when selecting an  IP.  Update the HARP as necessary to compensate  for  winds  that  are  different  than  those  forecasted.    Fly  FMS  or  GPS steering to the release point (green light).  When airdropping IAW these procedures, visual identification of the DZ is not required. 13.5.4.4.  Launch Acceptability Region (LAR) MFF Airdrop.  Aircrew may utilize LAR procedures when conducting MFF airdrops of US SOF personnel. 13.5.4.4.1.  Revised green and red light procedures for LAR airdrops: 13.5.4.4.1.1.  During crew-directed drops:  turn on the green light at the computed release  point  or  at  a  point  coordinated  with  the  jumpmaster,  provided  it  falls within the LAR. 13.5.4.4.1.2.  During  jumpmaster-directed  drops:    turn  on  the  green  light  upon entering  the  leading  edge  of  the  updated  LAR,  or  as  coordinated  with  the jumpmaster. 13.5.4.4.1.3.  During all MFF drops:  once the green light is on, it is permissible to  delay  turning  on  the  red  light  until  reaching  the  trailing  edge  of  the  updated LAR, minus an appropriate safety percentage, if applicable. 13.5.4.4.1.4.  Turn on the red light  if at  any  point during the airdrop sequence it appears the drop may occur outside safe parameters. 13.5.4.5.  Multiple Passes (i.e.  racetracks).  When performing multiple personnel  drops across the same DZ, checklists may resume at the 6-minute warning assuming no airdrop parameters  or  aircraft  configuration  changes  are  made  from  the  previous  drop.    Ensure the  loadmaster  has  adequate  time  to  complete  all  checklist  items  before  the  drop.  Exception:    During  pilot  directed  airdrops,  the  checklist  may  be  initiated  at  a  point commensurate with the available time and type of drop.  This will be coordinated at the briefing  between  the  crew  and  jumpmaster.    When  airdrop  parameters  or  aircraft configuration  changes  are  made  between  drops,  all  checklists  will  be  accomplished.  AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015   93  Airdrop  time  advisories  and  checklists  may  be  compressed,  except  for  the  one  minute warning.  Doors may remain open at the discretion of the PIC. 13.5.5.  Drop Configuration: 13.5.5.1.  Flaps.  As required.  Flaps up is the normal configuration. 13.5.5.2.  Airspeed.  Brief the jumpmaster on the airspeed used. 13.5.5.3.  Altitude.  Pressure altitude will be used as the airdrop altitude reference. 13.5.5.4.  Exits: 13.5.5.4.1.  All parachutists, with the exception of the jumpmaster, will stand forward of the aft cargo door until green light. 13.5.5.4.2.  All  parachutists,  including  the  jumpmaster,  will  exit  the  aircraft  during the green light time. 13.5.5.5.  Aircraft preparation.  Prior to operations, all roller conveyors will be removed, unless required for combination drops.  The overhead cargo hoist will be removed for all military free fall operations. 13.5.6.  Communications and Signals: 13.5.6.1.  Hand  Signals.    For  aircraft  without  jump  lights,  or  inoperable  jump  lights, emphasis and coordination with jumpmaster will be placed on hand signals for red/green light  and  aircraft  course  corrections  for  jumpmaster  directed  drops.    The  pilot  or loadmaster will coordinate the following hand signals with the jumpmaster: 13.5.6.1.1.  Time  warnings  (20,  10,  6,  2,  and  1  minute)  will  be  given  to  the parachutists  by  the  loadmaster  pointing  at  a  watch  and  indicating  with  fingers  the correct warning. 13.5.6.1.2.  Wind  velocity  on  the  DZ  will  be  given  an  open  hand,  palm  up,  moved horizontally and blowing into it and indicating with upturned fingers the speed of the wind. 13.5.6.1.3.  Passing the forefinger across the throat indicates a no-drop. 13.5.6.2.  Written  Messages.    The  loadmaster  will  write  out  messages  that  cannot  be passed by hand signals.  Messages for the pilot from the parachutists will be written out. 13.5.6.3.  In-flight  changes  to  the  HARP  location  or  significant  wind  changes  will  be relayed to the jumpmaster as soon as possible. 13.5.7.  Briefing.  Insist on positive feedback when discussing HARP location and wind data as well as resolving what items will be passed to the jumpmaster during flight.  Terminology should  be  clear  and  unambiguous.    The  following  items  will  be  discussed  during  the  pilot-jumpmaster briefing: 13.5.7.1.  Weather.  Include forecast altimeter setting at planned drop zone. 13.5.7.2.  Emergency descent procedures and time to descend to 10,000 feet MSL. 13.5.7.3.  HARP and prominent terrain features. 13.5.7.4.  DZ markings.   94  AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015 13.5.7.5.  Time at which all mission personnel will commence pre-breathing. 13.5.7.6.  Location and duration of the green light. 13.5.7.7.  En route flying time from takeoff to planned airdrop. 13.5.7.8.  Location and flying time to the nearest hypobaric chamber. 13.5.7.9.  Confirm parachute type with jumpmaster. 13.5.7.10.  Discuss  the  jumpmaster’s  plan  to  calculate  and  set  the  Cybernetic  Parachute Release System (CYPRES) Automatic Actuation Device (AAD), if used. 13.5.7.11.  Jumpmaster will be advised that parachutists must rehearse aircraft emergency ground  evacuation  and  in-flight  exit  procedures  at  least  twice  before  loading  with parachutes and equipment. 13.6.  Static Line Procedures. 13.6.1.  Reserved for future use. 13.7.  Standard Airdrop Training Bundle (SATB). 13.7.1.  The  SATB  is  a  unilateral  airdrop  training  sandbag  built  in  accordance  with TO 13C7111, Airdrop of Supplies and Equipment:  Rigging Containers. 13.7.2.  SATB Procedures. 13.7.2.1.  The loadmaster should preflight the bundle to ensure: 13.7.2.1.1.  The four parachute restraint ties in the four corners of the deployment bag are two-turns single 5 cord and not broken. 13.7.2.1.2.  The  parachute  bag  closing  tie  is  two-turns  single  5  cord  and  is  routed properly through the upper and lower bag closing loops. 13.7.2.1.3.  The U-bolt connector is connected to the load and the parachute. 13.7.2.1.4.  If dropping at night, a chemical illumination stick is attached to a point on the load. 13.7.2.1.5.  The  static  line  is  attached  to  an  aircraft  tie-down  ring  at  frame  15, configuration and cargo permitting. 13.7.2.2.  During preflight, the loadmaster will measure their restraint harness to preclude falling out of the aircraft. 13.7.2.3.  The loadmaster will don their restraint harness prior to calling the “10 minute” checklist complete.    WARNING:  The loadmaster will be connected to the aircraft prior to  opening  the  cargo  doors  and  when  the  cargo  door  manual  operation  handle  is  in  the “Open” position, unless aircraft safety is threatened.  (T-2) 13.7.2.4.  Upon hearing the “Green Light” call from the pilot/copilot, the loadmaster will throw the bundle out of the aircraft. 13.7.2.5.  Once the SATB is  clear of the aircraft, the LM will call “Load Clear”.  If the SATB  malfunctions,  the  LM  will  state  “Malfunction”,  and  proceed  with  the  airdrop malfunction checklist. AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015   95  13.7.2.6.  Upon hearing “Load Clear” or “Malfunction”, the PNF will state “Red Light” and turn on the red light if equipped. 13.7.2.7.  The  airdrop  sequence  is  complete  once  the  airdrop  malfunction  checklist  (if required) and the post-drop checklist have been completed. 13.7.3.  SATB Malfunction Procedures. 13.7.3.1.  Towed SATB: 13.7.3.1.1.  The loadmaster will call “Malfunction” and give a brief description of the problem. 13.7.3.1.2.  The  loadmaster  will  cut  the  bundle  free  on  command  of  the  pilot,  and notify the pilot “Bundle Released”.  If the bundle is causing damage to the aircraft or becoming entangled in the flight control surfaces, the loadmaster will notify the pilot of  the  condition  and  cut  the  bundle  free  immediately  and  notify  the  pilot  “Bundle Released”.       CAUTION:  The loadmaster will not attempt to retrieve the bundle.     Note:  It should be noted (time and location) where the bundle was released. 13.7.3.1.3.  After releasing the bundle, make every attempt to close the cargo doors (if required  the  loadmaster  can  manually  close  the  doors),  call  “Malfunction  Checks Complete” and perform the completion of drop checklist.         Note:  All simulated airdrops  will  be  conducted  with  the  cargo  doors  open  unless  otherwise  specified  by the aircraft commander. 13.8.  Identification of Airdrop Items. 13.8.1.  Immediate  identification  of  aerial  delivery  items  that  land  off  the  drop  zone  in unsecured areas may be necessary.  The following procedures will aid in denying the enemy usable  items  and  in  minimizing  the  risk  of  loss  of  life  over  items  that  may  be  expendable.  PICs  will  be  familiar  with  airdrop  contents  and  the  order  in  which  it  leaves  the  aircraft  for radio transmission to the combat control team, if requested.  Identify supplies or equipment by the following class numbering system: 13.8.1.1.  CLASS I – Subsistence (food), water (bottle), gratuitous, health, comfort items. 13.8.1.2.  CLASS  II  –  Clothing,  individual  equipment,  tentage,  organizational  tool  sets and  kits,  hand  tools,  unclassified  maps,  administrative  and  housekeeping  supplies  and equipment. 13.8.1.3.

This  chapter  contains  a  description  of  applicable  reports  and  forms.    For assistance  in  completing  safety  forms  contact  the  wing/group,  squadron,  or  local  flight  safety officer. to  AFI  91-204,  Safety 14.2.  AFSOC  Form  97,  Aircraft  Incident  Worksheet.  Refer Investigations  and  Reports,  and  the  AFSOC  Sup.    The  Safety  Office  (HQ  AFSOC/SE)  will  be notified of the following high interest items:  Off drop zone (DZ) drops, insertion injuries, IFR incidents,  dropped  objects,  or  any  other  incident  which,  in  the  judgment  of  the  Flight  Safety Officer  (FSO),  needs  to  be  reported.    Use  the  AFSOC  Form  97,  Aircraft  Incident  Worksheet, when  reporting  these  incidents  to  HQ  AFSOC/SE.    AFI  91-204,  Safety  Investigations  and Reports,  and  the  AFSOC  Sup  provide  policy  guidance  that  is  common  to  investigating  and reporting all US Air Force mishaps and instructions for using AFSOC Form 97, Aircraft Incident Worksheet.  Safety investigations and reports are conducted and written solely to prevent future mishaps.  Safety investigations take priority over any corresponding legal investigations, except friendly fire mishaps.  (T-2) 14.3.  AF  Form  457,  USAF  Hazard  Report.  Refer  to  AFI  91-202,  The  US  Air  Force  Mishap Prevention  Program.    The  USAF  hazard  reporting  system  provides  a  means  for  Air  Force personnel  to  alert  supervisors  and  commanders  to  hazardous  conditions  requiring  prompt corrective  action.    A  hazard  is  any  condition,  act,  or  circumstance  that  jeopardizes  or  may jeopardize  the  health  and  well-being  of  personnel  or  which  may  result  in  loss,  damage,  or destruction of any weapons system, equipment, facility, or material resource. 14.4.

The  Air  Force  HATR  program  provides  a  means  for  personnel  to  report  all  near midair  collisions  and  alleged  hazardous  air  traffic  conditions.    Use  information  in  HATR reports only for mishap prevention.  AFI 91-202, lists reportable incidents. 14.4.2.  Procedures: 14.4.2.1.  Make an airborne report of the hazardous condition to the nearest ATC agency (e.g.,  center,  Flight  Service  Station  (FSS),  control  tower,  or  aeronautical  radio  station), and give the following information as appropriate: 14.4.2.1.1.  Identification or call sign. 14.4.2.1.2.  Time and place (radial/DME, position relative to the airfield, etc.). 14.4.2.1.3.  Altitude or flight level. 14.4.2.1.4.  Description of the other aircraft or vehicle. 14.4.2.1.5.  Include  a  verbal  statement  as  soon  as  possible  after  occurrence  that  a written  HATR  report  will  be  filed  upon  landing.                  Note:    ATC  agencies  (e.g., FAA, etc.) must know if an official report is being filed. 14.4.2.2.  File the HATR as soon as possible (within 24 hours) using any available means of  communication.    Normally,  it  should  be  filed  at  the  base  operations  office  at  the   98  AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015 landing  airport.    If  this  is  impractical  and  if  communications  permit,  notify  the  safety office of the Air Force base where the condition occurred, the safety office at the home station, or as prescribed by the overseas MAJCOM.  In any case, provide the safety office with  all  available  information  needed  to  prepare  AF  Form  651,  Hazardous  Air  Traffic Report  (HATR).    Turn  in  a  completed  copy  of  AF  Form  651  to  the  wing/group  safety office.    Note:  HATR reports are not privileged information and may be released outside the USAF. 14.4.3.  Individuals  submitting  a  HATR  are  granted  immunity  from  disciplinary  action provided: 14.4.3.1.  Their violation was not deliberate. 14.4.3.2.  They committed no criminal offense. 14.4.3.3.  No mishap occurred. 14.4.3.4.  They properly reported the incident using the above procedures. 14.5.  AF  Form  711,  USAF  Aircraft  Mishap  Report  Worksheet.

Equal  Time  Point  (ETP).  The  equal  time point is  an  airborne decision point.   It  is  the point along the route of flight (usually overwater) from which it takes the same amount of time to return to the point of departure (or to the last suitable airfield) as it would to continue to the destination (or the first suitable airfield).  In no wind conditions, the ETP is simply the halfway point between the two airfields.  However, when flying into a headwind, the ETP moves closer to the destination aerodrome.  Conversely, when flying into a tailwind, the ETP moves closer to the departure aerodrome.  These calculations will also be impacted by the decision to fly at lower altitudes.    The  distance  and  time  to  the  ETP  from  the  departure  aerodrome  (or  last  suitable airfield) may be calculated using the following formulas:  (reference Figure A2.1 and A2.2). Figure A2.1.  Equal Time Point Formula, Problem, and Solution.    132  AFI11-2C-145AV3  23 JUNE 2015 Figure A2.2.  Example.
