This CFETP provides information necessary for the Air Force Career Field Manager (AFCFM), MAJCOM functional managers (MFMs), commanders, training managers, supervisors, and trainers to plan, develop, manage, and conduct an effective and efficient career field training program.  The plan outlines the training that individuals must receive in order to develop and progress throughout their career.  For the purpose of this plan, training is divided into four areas:  initial skills, upgrade training (UGT), qualification training (QT), and continuation training (CT).  Initial skills training is the Air Force Specialty specific training an individual receives upon entry into the Air Force or upon retraining into this specialty for award of the 3-skill level.  Upgrade training identifies the mandatory courses, task qualification requirements, and correspondence course completion required for award of the 3-, 5-, 7-, and 9- skill levels.  Qualification training is actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an airman in a specific duty position.  This training program occurs both during and after the upgrade training process.  It is designed to provide the performance skills/knowledge training required for the job.  Continuation training is additional training either in-residence or exportable advanced training courses, or on-the-job training, provided to personnel to increase their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required.  The CFETP has several purposes, some are: 1.1.  Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field training program.   1.2.  Identifies task and knowledge training requirements and recommends education and training for each skill level and phase of an individual’s career in this AFS. 1.3.  Lists training courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of training, and the training medium. 1.4.  Identifies major resource constraints that impact full implementation of the desired career field training program. 2.  Uses.   The plan will be used by MFMs and supervisors at all levels to ensure comprehensive and cohesive training programs are available and/or instituted for each individual in the specialty. 2.1.  AETC training personnel will develop and revise formal resident, non-resident, field and exportable training based on requirements established by the user and documented in Part II of the CFETP.  They will also work with the AFCFM to develop acquisition strategies for obtaining resources needed to provide the identified training. 2.2.  MFMs will ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial and upgrade skills requirements.  OJT, resident training, contract training, or exportable courses can satisfy identified requirements.  MAJCOM-developed training to support this AFSC must be identified for inclusion in this plan and must not duplicate available training resources. 2.3.  Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan.  The list of courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training. 2.4.  Personnel in AFSCs 1AXXX or 1U0X1 are exempt from maintaining OJT Training Folders (AF Form 623). All training is certified via AF Form 8 by trained flight examiners.  Certification of the AF Form 8 Certificate of Aircrew Qualification eliminates the requirement to document STS items in this CFETP.   3.  Coordination and Approval.  The AFCFM is the approval authority.  MAJCOM functional managers and AETC training managers will identify and coordinate on the career field training requirements.  The AFCFM will initiate an annual review of this document and coordinate with AETC and MFMs to ensure currency and accuracy. Using the list of courses in Part II, they will eliminate duplicate training. Send applicable inputs/changes to this CFETP through MAJCOM functional managers to HQ USAF/A3OI, 1480 Air Force Pentagon, Washington D.C. 20330-1480 or the following organizational email address:  usaf.pentagon.af-a3.mbx.a3oim-workflow@mail.mil.    8 CFETP 1A6X1 19 January 2016 Section B - Career Progression and Information 4.

The course flow has been developed and agreed upon by the MAJCOM functional managers to minimize days students are awaiting training and to ensure survival training is typically completed prior to AFSC award--minimizing the impact of not having the prerequisites completed before entering weapons system training. 8.1.2. Personnel graduating from the Lackland AFB course are awarded AFSC 1A631 and are authorized to wear the Basic Aircrew Member Badge. Wear and permanent awarding requirements of the Basic Aircrew Member Badge will be IAW AFI 11-402, Aviation and Parachutist Service Aeronautical Ratings and Badges and MAJCOM supplements.  Failure to complete initial qualification training (IQT) is justification for supervisors to recommend revocation of wear of the aircrew member badge.   15 CFETP 1A6X1 19 January 2016      Figure 2  1A6X1 Training Path 2 of 2   16 Table 6  1A6X1 Enlisted Education and Training Path CFETP 1A6X1 19 January 2016 Enlisted Education and Training Path GRADE  REQUIREMENTS 1A6X1 Average       3 years 6.21 years High Year of Tenure (HYT)   8 years 15  years 20 years 24  years 26  years 30  years Education and Training Requirements Basic Military Training School (BMTS) Apprentice Technical School (3-Skill Level) Upgrade To Journeyman  (5-Skill Level) - Completion of Initial/Mission Qualification Training Rank  Amn A1C Amn A1C SrA Earliest Sew-on  6 months 10 months Air Force Average   SrA 28 SSgt TSgt 5  years 3  years months 3 years 4.45  years Airman Leadership School (ALS) - At least 3 years TIS but no more than 6 years TIS - Resident graduation is a prerequisite for SSgt   sew-on (RegAF Only) Upgrade To Craftsman  (7-Skill Level) - Minimum rank of SSgt - 12 months OJT - 6 months OJT for retrainees Basic EPME Phase 2 Distance Learning - At least 7 years to 12 years TIS -Required to reenlist and compete for promotion EPME Intermediate Learning Experience (ILE) -Minimum 8 years TIS no more than 12 years -Complete/Pass EPME DL Phase 2 -Must be TSgt, TSgt Select, or SSgt Basic EPME Phase 3 Distance Learning (DL) - At Least 12 years to 18 years TIS - Required to reenlist and compete for promotion EPME Advanced Learning Experience (ALE) - Minimum 13 years TIS, no more than 18 years  - Complete/Pass EPME DL Phase 2 &3  - Must be a SMSgt, SMSgt select, or MSgt to attend Upgrade to Superintendent (9-Skill level) - Minimum rank of SMSgt Chief Leadership Course FDL -No TIS requirements -Required for re-enlistment and development opportunities -Must be a CMSgt or CMSgt Select Chief Enlisted Manager (CEM) - Minimum rank of CMSgt - Completed EPME ALE (RegAF Only) Data current as of  2 June 2015 Reference:  AFI 36-2301; AFI 36-2201Air Force Training Program ; and https://mypers.af.mil 14.78  years 21.84  years 10.53 years 14  years 11  years 19.0  years CMSgt 8  years SMSgt MSgt   11.58 years 14.96  years 20.38 years 18.4 years       17 CFETP 1A6X1 19 January 2016 Section C - Skill Level Training Requirements 9.

Each objective is indicated as follows:  W indicates task or subject knowledge which is measured using a written test, PC indicates required task performance which is measured with a performance progress check, and PC/W indicates separate measurement of both knowledge and performance elements using a written test and a performance progress check. 5.  Standard.   The standard is 85 percent on written examinations.  Standards for performance measurement are indicated in the objective and delineated on the individual progress checklist.  Instructor assistance is provided as needed during the progress check, and students may be required to repeat all or part of the behavior until satisfactory performance is attained. 6.  Proficiency Level.   Most task performance is taught to the “2b” proficiency level which means the students can do most parts of the task, but does need assistance on the hardest parts of the task (partially proficient).  The student can also determine step-by-step procedures for doing the task. 7.  Advanced Skills Course. NOTE:  There is currently no advanced course.  This area is reserved.
