LOCAL REQUIREMENTS:  NOTES: 1 - Type of system (pulsed or continuous wave) - Operating frequency (or frequency range) - Peak power (Pp)/average power - Pulse repetition frequency (PRF) - Pulse width (PW) - Gain 2 3  - AFOSH STD 48-9 A4.1.3.6.4. All systems operating between 0.003 and 100 MHz shall be evaluated to determine if induced current or contact current limits may be exceeded. Consult with USAFSAM, for a determination regarding the potential for exceeding current limits. - AFOSH STD 48-9 A4.1.3.6.5. Generally both the E and H fields must be determined for frequencies less than 300 MHz. For frequencies equal to or less than 30 MHz, assessments can only be accomplished by the independent measurement of both field components. The need to measure both E and H fields below 300 MHz derives from a consideration of the spatial variation in E and H field strengths in the reactive near field of an antenna. Both probes are required to measure these fields. Contact USAFSAM for assistance in obtaining required equipment if it is not locally available. For frequencies between 30 and 300 MHz, it may be possible through analysis to show that measurement of only one of the two field components is sufficient. - AFOSH STD 48-9 A4.1.3.6.6. For frequencies above 300 MHz, only one field component need be measured, usually the E field. MPE boundary locations are to be established by determining the farthest distance from the radiating source that a MPE value (E or H field) can be exceeded using appropriate measurement techniques for the conditions of measurements. - E = electric field /electromagnetic wave (volts/meter) - H = magnetic field/electromagnetic wave (amps/meter) - < 300 MHz both E and H required - ≤ 30 MHz both E and H independently required - ≥ 300 MHz usually the E field - Use AFOSH STD 48-9 Tables A3.1.

The DF represents the emitter’s total “on time”. The Pavg represent the average power output between given the percentage of “on time”.    The DF for a continuous wave emitter is 1 and the Pavg is the rated power of the emitter. The DF and Pavg for a pulsed emitter are calculated as: DF = PW * PRF   PW is the pulse width; the length of time, in seconds, that each pulse lasts   PRF is the pulse repetition frequency; the number of pulses that occur in a second   Pavg = Ppeak * DF 3.  Gain of an antenna, also called directivity, is the antenna’s ability to concentrate energy in a particular direction expressed in units of decibels (dB). Gabs is a unitless number calculated using the gain: Gabs  =   10(gain/10)  4.  RRF is a unitless number indicating the fraction of time an emitter illuminates a given point.  For stationary emitters, the RRF is 1. For rotating emitters: RRF = beam width/sector size   beam width is the width of the beam, in degrees sector size is the size of the total path of the beam, in degrees  7     AFQTP 4B051-15                                                                                         Journeyman Training Guide:  EMF 5.

During the recognition identification phase each emitter should be reviewed to determine the necessity and priority for performing further surveys and measurements during the evaluation phase. o  Review past surveys of the emitter or similar systems. Workplace folders, DOEHRS, and the EMF Emitter Inventory may be able to provide previous survey data. o  Review technical orders on the systems and look for parameters and other hazard distance information.   Use of the EMF Survey Checklist staring on page 68 of AFRL-SA-WP-SR-2013-0003, Base-Level Guide for Electromagnetic Frequency Radiation, Dec 2012 will help to prevent missing any critical information 2.     Ground level hazard emitters are systems capable of producing power density levels at or above the MPE in areas accessible to personnel at or near ground level. Many aircraft mounted radar and electronic countermeasures (ECM) systems will fall into this category.   Climbing hazard emitters are systems capable of producing levels of EMF in excess of the MPE, but only in  areas that require climbing. Inaccessible emitters are systems capable of producing levels in excess of the MPE, but are not accessible to personnel.   Short duration emitters are systems capable of producing levels in excess of the MPE, but the transmission time is relatively short when compared to the MPE averaging time, under normal operating conditions.  13      AFQTP 4B051-15                                                                                         Journeyman Training Guide:  EMF 3.    Generally both the E and H fields must be determined for frequencies less than 300 MHz. For frequencies equal to or less than 30 MHz, assessments can only be accomplished by the independent measurement of both field components.   For frequencies above 300 MHz, only one field component need be measured, usually the E field. 4.    Find the correction factor (CF) on the probe handle; locate the frequency of the emitter being evaluated, and  read the CF for that frequency If exact frequency is not listed; o If the actual frequency and correction factor frequency are within 10% of each other, chose CF for the closest frequency listed If difference is greater than 10%, do a linear interpolation to determine the CF o CF =   [(Frequency − Frequencyb)(CFa −   CFb)(Frequencya −   Frequencyb)]  + CFb Where: Frequency = frequency of operation CF = CF for frequency of operation Frequencya = frequency listed above frequency of operation CFa = CF for frequency listed above frequency of operation Frequencyb = frequency listed below frequency of operation CFb = CF for frequency listed below frequency of operation   Correction factors are multiplied by the meter reading to obtain actual power density; so the reading the meter will display at the MPE = MPE / CF 5.  NOTE:  A probe burnout calculation and rating are dependent on the specific instrumentation.  Narda Meters (8700, NBM Series) have built in safety mechanisms (alarms) that prevent exceeding the allowable power density that the probe can manage.  To determine if you have a burnout rating for your instrument, please reference the manufactures instruction manul.  If a burnout rating exists, the calculation below will determine the probe burnout rating.  If a burnout rating DOES NOT exist, use the probe overload ratings.      Calculate duty factor (DF) Where: DF = PW  × PRF PW = pulse width of emitter PRF = pulse repetition frequency of emitter  Identify burnout rating (BR) listed on the probe    Calculate PDmax PDmax =  DF  × BRCF  Where: PDmax = maximum meter reading you can have before burnout occurs.

Identify isotropic probes available and explain select probe specifications (to be identified by trainer). 4.  Select the appropriate probe (based on emitter specifications provide by trainer). 5.  Connect the probe. 6.  Prepare the instrument per the user’s manual (i.e., turn on, perform battery check, zero the probe, etc.). 7.  Zero the instrument per the user’s manual.1 8.  Demonstrate proper probe orientation during use. 9.  Take measurements and record the results.    LOCAL REQUIREMENTS:   NOTES: 1.  Zero Drift: Zero drift is inherent with instrumentation that utilizes thermocouples and temperature sensitive components. Premature commencement of a survey without allowing the electronics to reach equilibrium and a change in ambient temperature during a survey are common causes of zero drift. To reduce errors from zero drift, perform the following if needed:          Connect and turn instrumentation “on” at least 10 minutes before survey measurements are made. Locate instruments in the same environment you intend to survey; it doesn’t make much sense to equilibrate instrumentation indoors if one intends to survey outdoors at a different temperature.  Periodically check the zero of an instrument during survey measurements, especially in one is moving between areas of significantly different ambient temperatures (sunny vs. shaded). To re-zero instrumentation during a survey one can:  (a) Completely leave the EMF field.  (b) Completely shield the probe in a metal can or Narda instrument case if it provides shielding.  (c) Shield the probe with your body. Your body will effectively absorb signals with frequencies higher than 1,000 MHz.  21  AFQTP 4B051-15                                                                                         Journeyman Training Guide:  EMF TRAINEE REVIEW QUESTIONS Line Item 4.9.4.10:  Use EMF instrumentation 1.
