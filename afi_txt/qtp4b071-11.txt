Why should you evaluate operating procedures by observing work practices during a site inspection survey?  A:   Performing a Site Inspection Survey: There are many important aspects to consider during a site visit. This monitoring survey, coupled with the initial hazard estimations, should allow the BE to determine if there are any potentially hazardous areas accessible to personnel. Verify there are no other EMF sources in the same area or overlapping sources. In this survey BE should evaluate existing OIs for effectiveness and evaluate any existing control measures. Take time to note the work practices of shop personnel. Sometimes actual work practices vary considerably from their description!

All systems operating between 0.003 and 100 MHz shall be evaluated to determine if induced current or contact current limits may be exceeded. Consult with USAFSAM, for a determination regarding the potential for exceeding current limits. - AFOSH STD 48-9 A4.1.3.6.5. Generally both the E and H fields must be determined for frequencies less than 300 MHz. For frequencies equal to or less than 30 MHz, assessments can only be accomplished by the independent measurement of both field components. The need to measure both E and H fields below 300 MHz derives from a consideration of the spatial variation in E and H field strengths in the reactive near field of an antenna. Both probes are required to measure these fields. Contact USAFSAM for assistance in obtaining required equipment if it is not locally available. For frequencies between 30 and 300 MHz, it may be possible through analysis to show that measurement of only one of the two field components is sufficient. - AFOSH STD 48-9 A4.1.3.6.6. For frequencies above 300 MHz, only one field component need be measured, usually the E field. MPE boundary locations are to be established by determining the farthest distance from the radiating source that a MPE value (E or H field) can be exceeded using appropriate measurement techniques for the conditions of measurements. - E = electric field /electromagnetic wave (volts/meter) - H = magnetic field/electromagnetic wave (amps/meter) - < 300 MHz both E and H required - ≤ 30 MHz both E and H independently required - ≥ 300 MHz usually the E field 7     2   AFQTP 4B071-11             3                                            Craftsman Training Guide:  EMF - Use AFOSH STD 48-9 Tables A3.1.

LOCAL REQUIREMENTS:  NOTES: 1.  See 4.9.4.5 - Determine EMF Maximum Permissible Exposure (MPEs) 2.  The DF represents the emitter’s total “on time”. The Pavg represent the average power output between given the percentage of “on time”.  The DF for a continuous wave emitter is 1 and the Pavg is the rated power of the emitter. The DF and Pavg for a pulsed emitter are calculated as: DF = PW * PRF   PW is the pulse width; the length of time, in seconds, that each pulse lasts   PRF is the pulse repetition frequency; the number of pulses that occur in a second   Pavg = Ppeak * DF 3.  Gain of an antenna, also called directivity, is the antenna’s ability to concentrate energy in a particular direction expressed in units of decibels (dB). Gabs is a unitless number calculated using the gain: Gabs  =   10(gain/10)  4.  RRF is a unitless number indicating the fraction of time an emitter illuminates a given point.    For stationary emitters, the RRF is 1. For rotating emitters: RRF = beam width/sector size   beam width is the width of the beam, in degrees sector size is the size of the total path of the beam, in degrees  13                                            Craftsman Training Guide:  EMF  AFQTP 4B071-11             5.

For frequencies equal to or less than 30 MHz, assessments can only be accomplished by the independent measurement of both field components.   For frequencies above 300 MHz, only one field component need be measured, usually the E field. 4.    Find the correction factor (CF) on the probe handle; locate the frequency of the emitter being evaluated, and  read the CF for that frequency If exact frequency is not listed; o If the actual frequency and correction factor frequency are within 10% of each other, chose CF for the closest frequency listed If difference is greater than 10%, do a linear interpolation to determine the CF o CF =   [(Frequency − Frequencyb)(CFa −   CFb)(Frequencya −   Frequencyb)]  + CFb Where: Frequency = frequency of operation CF = CF for frequency of operation Frequencya = frequency listed above frequency of operation CFa = CF for frequency listed above frequency of operation Frequencyb = frequency listed below frequency of operation CFb = CF for frequency listed below frequency of operation   Correction factors are multiplied by the meter reading to obtain actual power density; so the reading the meter will display at the MPE = MPE / CF 5.  NOTE:  A probe burnout calculation and rating are dependent on the specific instrumentation.  Narda Meters (8700, NBM Series) have built in safety mechanisms (alarms) that prevent exceeding the allowable power density that the probe can manage.  To determine if you have a burnout rating for your instrument, please reference the manufactures instruction manul.  If a burnout rating exists, the calculation below will determine the probe burnout rating.  If a burnout rating DOES NOT exist, use the probe overload ratings.      Calculate duty factor (DF) Where: DF = PW  × PRF PW = pulse width of emitter PRF = pulse repetition frequency of emitter  Identify burnout rating (BR) listed on the probe    Calculate PDmax PDmax =  DF  × BRCF  Where: PDmax = maximum meter reading you can have before burnout occurs. BR = probe burnout rating CF = probe correction factor (at frequency of operation) 20 AFQTP 4B071-11                                                        Craftsman Training Guide:  EMF          6.     Worst case operating parameters should be used to define the location of action level MPEs whenever possible (fixed position, highest peak power, highest duty factor, and highest gain), unless the system has been previously measured   Maintain absolute control thru the emitter operator   Ensure that no other interfering EMF sources are being operated in the area   For aircraft mounted radar and electronic countermeasures (ECM) systems o  Ensure aircraft is positioned with ample clear area in front to preclude unnecessary radiation of other objects o  Stop antenna dead ahead in azimuth and at zero degrees or slightly above in elevation, if possible  7.     Visit the site to determine accessibility, locations, and conditions that present potential hazards.   Verify the conclusions drawn during the recognition phase.   To prevent zero drift, connect and turn instrumentation “on” at least 10 minutes before survey measurements are made to allow the electronics to reach equilibrium.    Measure to identify actual hazard locations and to define controls for these hazards.   Measurements should be conducted to determine two hazard distances, one for the Upper Tier MPE one for the action level MPE (above the Lower Tier).   Approach the beam from a safe distance (> calculated/theoretical DMPE distance)   Avoid placing any body part or the instrument probe between the feedhorn and the reflector during the survey   Find the beam using the proper probe orientation (out in front and slightly off center) o If using an isotropic survey meter, probe handle must be parallel with beam   Take small steps forward toward the emitter, periodically stopping to determine the beam size, shape, and characteristics   Conduct measurements using “spatial averaging” technique   Periodically check the zero of an instrument during survey measurements, especially in one is moving between areas of significantly different ambient temperatures   Once the meter reaches the reading the meter will display at the MPE, note the location of the probe   Have the operator shut off the emitter   Measure distance from the emitter to the location that the MPE was reached (this will be the actual Dmpe)   Turn on emitter (insure outside actual Dmpe)   Survey the area immediately surrounding the antenna looking for hazardous levels of energy Identify reflections, hot spots, side lobes, back scatter etc. o o  Check transmission lines   Where multiple EMF emitters may be collocated in fixed arrangements, EMF evaluation data should include a determination of the weighted contribution from expected simultaneously operated emitters (unity calculation).  8.    The inventories will include at a minimum the following categories: Work Center, Point of Contact (POC), POC Phone Number, Emitter Nomenclature (i.e. AN/GRT-21), Emitter Description (i.e. TACAN), Quantity, Frequency Range, Upper Tier and Lower Tier MPEs, and Hazard Distances   Documentation Requirements.  o Include a brief hazard assessment narrative summarizing the potential hazards involved with the use and operation of the specific emitter.  o  The exact locations where the MPEs can be exceeded for both Upper and Lower Tier areas should be included and demonstrated in a diagram or photograph.  o  Facilities responsible for the use and operation of emitters capable of producing levels at or above the MPE should also have an entry in DOEHRS.   Records of surveys, reports, calculations, and control measures imposed shall be maintained for each fielded EMF emitter which is capable of exceeding the MPEs in Attachment 3, Table A3.2 of AFOSH Std 48-9 21 AFQTP 4B071-11                                                        Craftsman Training Guide:  EMF    22 AFQTP 4B071-11                                                        Craftsman Training Guide:  EMF TRAINEE REVIEW QUESTIONS        STS Line Item 4.9.4.7:  Perform EMF measurement surveys 1.

Explain the purpose of an EMF pre-survey process?  A:  Below are a few examples/acceptable answers of tasks that need to be accomplished during the pre-survey:     Coordinate arrangements for the survey   Ensure other required safety controls are in place    Perform calculations   Check equipment (Source:  AFRL-SA-WP-SR-2013-0003, Base-Level Guide for Electromagnetic Frequency Radiation, Dec 2012, pg 68)  2.  Summarize the two types of surveys BE can accomplish (Emitter site inspection survey and Measurement survey)?  A:  Emitter site inspection survey: Survey of an emitter site to determine accessibility of EMF emitters to personnel, how the emitter is used, and the condition of the control measures.  Measurement survey: Near and far-field calculations need to be done prior to surveying. In the event that calculations are not made prior to monitoring, special monitoring concerns will come into play when crossing from the far field and entering the near field. Separate measurements of both the electric and magnetic fields should be made until it is certain that one is well outside the near field before relying on a single probe. A single probe is used only when the electric and magnetic fields are proportional and interchangeable, that is, the ratio of the two remains constant through space (i.e. far field). Measurement surveys will be performed to determine levels of EMF in regions accessible to personnel.

Perform field EMF measurements at the location for documentation of the EMF exposure. This is done to verify actual levels which can often be less the calculated levels. 5.

Document the circumstances surrounding the exposure incident, statements from personnel involved in that incident, and recommendations to prevent similar occurrences. 7.  Investigate.1 8.  Prepare a report summarizing the investigation within 30 days following completion.2    LOCAL REQUIREMENTS:  NOTES:   1.  Take care to protect yourself and your instrument while reconstructing the incident. Make measurements with the system set up, as nearly as possible, as it was when the incident occurred. It may be that the power density at the point of exposure is greater than the measuring capability of your instrument (Narda 8723D, Max Scale= 100 mW/cm2). If this is the case, you should make multiple measurements starting at, say, 10 mW/cm2 and move up in increments until you reach the limit. These data can be plotted on a spreadsheet and the actual exposure value can be estimated by extrapolation. Also, USAFSAM has Narda 8715 probes that allow measurements up to 2000 mW/cm2. These probes are being phased out, Narda’s newest probes, part of the NBM Series, will similarly allow measurements up to 1500 mW/cm2.  When determining the total exposure, you must know the duration of the exposure. This can be very tricky, because the time estimates of the exposee and witnesses can be and are usually very exaggerated. Ask the exposee to repeat his/her actions and use a stop watch to get a better idea of the actual exposure time. The shorter the time, the more important this becomes.  Photographs are a very important part of your investigation. With the transmitter shut down, ask everyone to position themselves exactly as they were during the incident. Then take photographs from a few different angles. You can have the base photo lab do the photography, but you must tell them exactly what you want.  2.  BE provides the report to supervision owning the EMF source and AF/SE, who then have <5 days to summarize the entire investigation (see AFOSH Std 48-9 for report requirements) and distribute it.       27 AFQTP 4B071-11                                                        Craftsman Training Guide:  EMF TRAINEE REVIEW QUESTIONS         STS Line Item 4.9.4.9:  Investigate potential EMF overexposures or accidents 1.

LOCAL REQUIREMENTS:   NOTES:  1.  Zero Drift: Zero drift is inherent with instrumentation that utilizes thermocouples and temperature sensitive components. Premature commencement of a survey without allowing the electronics to reach equilibrium and a change in ambient temperature during a survey is a common cause of zero drift. To reduce errors from zero drift, perform the following if needed:      Connect and turn instrumentation “on” at least 10 minutes before survey measurements are made. Locate instruments in the same environment you intend to survey; it doesn’t make much sense to equilibrate instrumentation indoors if one intends to survey outdoors at a different temperature.       Periodically check the zero of an instrument during survey measurements, especially in one is moving between areas of significantly different ambient temperatures (sunny vs. shaded). To re-zero instrumentation during a survey one can:  (a) Completely leave the EMF field.   (b) Completely shield the probe in a metal can or Narda instrument case if it provides shielding.   (c) Shield the probe with your body. Your body will effectively absorb signals with frequencies higher than 1,000 MHz.    32 AFQTP 4B071-11                                                        Craftsman Training Guide:  EMF TRAINEE REVIEW QUESTIONS       STS Line Item 4.9.4.10:  Use EMF instrumentation 1.

Explain the types of electric and magnetic meters (i.e. Field Strength Meters and Narrowband Meters)?  A:  Electric and Magnetic Field Strength Meters: Electric and magnetic field strength meters are narrowband devices. Examples of these Narda meters are noted below in Figure 18a. All the 8700 series meters have interchangeable probes for electric and magnetic fields. They consist of an antenna, cable(s) to carry the signal from the antenna, and a signal conditioning/readout instrument. Narda’s newest broadband field meters plug-and-play probe interface with automatic probe parameter detection (see Figure 18b).  Field strength meters may use linear antennas, such as monopoles, dipoles, loops, biconical or conical log spiral antennas, horns or parabolic reflectors. The appropriate field parameters can be determined from a measurement of voltage or power at the selected frequency and at the antenna terminal. The electric (or magnetic) field strength can be derived from information on the antenna gain or antenna factor and the loss in the connecting cable.
