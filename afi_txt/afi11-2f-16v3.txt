Responsibilities.  This  instruction  prescribes  procedures  for  operating  F-16  aircraft  under most  circumstances.  It  is  not  a  substitute  for  sound  judgment.  Procedures  not  specifically addressed may be accomplished if they enhance safe and effective mission accomplishment. 1.2.  Waiver Requests.  AFI33-360 directs using Form 679 for waivers. 8 AFI11-2F-16V3  13 JULY 2016 Chapter 2 MISSION PLANNING Section 2A—General 2.1.  Responsibilities.  The  responsibility  for  mission  planning  is  shared  jointly  by  all  flight members  and  the  operations  and  intelligence  functions  of  fighter  organizations.    Fighter  unit personnel must accomplish sufficient flight planning to ensure safe mission execution, to include fuel requirements, map preparation, and takeoff/landing data. (T-1). 2.2.  Bird/Wildlife  Aircraft  Strike  Hazard  (BASH)  Programs.  Bird  Watch  Conditions  are defined  in  AFI  91-202,  The  US  Air  Force  Mishap  Prevention  Program,  and  AFPAM  91-212, Bird/Wildlife  Aircraft  Strike  Hazard  (BASH)  Management  Techniques.    The  OG/CC  will determine local BASH procedures. (T-3). 2.2.1.  Takeoffs, landings, or low-levels within one hour of either sunrise or sunset during the phase  II  period  increase  likelihood  of  birdstrike.    Significant  bird  hazards  are  published  in FLIP GP, the IFR Supplement and local airfield guidance. 2.2.2.  When  operating  at  airfields  where  no  BASH  program  exists,  pilots  should  make appropriate  decisions  based  on  observable  bird  conditions  and  seek  assistance  from  local airfield personnel. 2.2.3.  Pilots should consider bird migratory patterns during enroute portion of the mission to minimize  the  potential  of  an  in-flight  bird  strike.  The  Bird  Avoidance  Model  (BAM)  on United  States  Avian  Hazard  Advisory  System  (http://www.usahas.com)  provides  BASH information,  including  regionalized  CONUS  bird  migration,  PFPS  software  overlay,  and latest news. See AFPAM 91-212 for additional information. 2.3.  Standards.  The  OG/CC  may  publish  and  approve  group  or  wing  standards.    Operations Group  Stan/Eval  (OGV)  will  review  all  standards  for  AFI  11-series  compliance  prior  to publication. (T-1). 2.4.  CBRNE.  Aircrew  must use the procedures for operation in  a CBRNE-threat environment contained in Attachment 2. (T-1). 2.5.  Flight Material Preparation. 2.5.1.  Mission  Data  Card  (MDC).    The  minimum  TOLD  requirements  on  the  MDC  are: 2,000  foot  acceleration  check  speed  (if  computed  takeoff  roll  exceeds  2,500  feet);  refusal speed  (dry/wet);  rotation  speed;  takeoff  speed;  takeoff  distance;  normal  landing  speed  and distance  (dry/wet);  heavyweight  (immediately  after  takeoff)  landing  speed  and  distance (dry/wet).    If  computed  takeoff  roll  is  less  than  2,500  feet,  pilots  must  evaluate  aircraft performance  by  comparing  actual  takeoff  distance  to  computed  takeoff  distance  or  use  a 1000 foot acceleration check speed. (T-1). 2.5.2.  Local Area Maps.  Pilots must carry a local area map unless pilot aids include jettison areas,  divert  information,  controlled  bailout  areas,  and  provide  sufficient  detail  of  the  local area to remain within assigned training areas. (T-1). AFI11-2F-16V3  13 JULY 2016 9 2.5.3.  Enroute  Charts.    Pilots  may  substitute  FLIP  enroute  charts  for  maps  on  navigational flights within areas adequately covered by these charts. 2.5.4.  Low Altitude Maps. 2.5.4.1.  On low altitude flights, each pilot will carry a current map (updated using Chart Update  Manual  or  electronic  equivalent)  of  the  route/operating  area.  (T-1).    Pilots  will ensure it is of such scale and quality that the detail of terrain features, hazards, and chart annotations  permits  navigation  and  safe  mission  accomplishment.  (T-1).    Pilots  will circle/highlight  manmade  obstacles  at  above  planned  flight  altitude  within  5nm  of  the planned route. (T-1).  Pilots will annotate time or distance tick marks and headings. (T-1). 2.5.4.2.  Pilots  will  annotate  route  abort  altitude  (RAA)  using  the  IFR  Off  Airways guidance in AFI 11-202V3, chapter 6. (T-1). 2.5.4.3.  For  flights  inside  the  Continental  United  states  (CONUS)  under  Visual  Flight Rules  (VFR)  or  inside  Military  Training  Routes  (MTR),  pilots  will  comply  with  the following: 2.5.4.3.1.  Use  FLIP  AP/1B  and  either  sectional  aeronautical  charts  or  mission planning  software  (e.g.  Falcon  View/JMPS).  (T-1).    Pilots  will  select  the  following overlay  options  for  PFPS/Falcon  View:  airports/heliports,  airspace  boundaries, airways, MTR, parachute jump and special use airspace boundaries. (T-1). 2.5.4.3.2.  Annotate low level charts, or locally developed low-level route books, with location and dimensions of class B/C/D airspace, military airfields, civil airfields, and other  potential  high  density  traffic  areas  (e.g.,  parachute  activity  areas  and  ultra light/hang glider/glider sites) within 5 NM of any planned VFR route or MTR lateral boundary.  (T-1).    Pilots  will  annotate  airfield  approach  control  frequencies  in  the vicinity of class B/C/D airspace as well as the intersection of other VR/IR routes or other areas of conflict. (T-1). 2.5.4.4.  Outside  the  CONUS,  pilots  will  follow  gaining  MAJCOM,  theater,  or  host nation guidance on mission planning.   (T-1).    If no such guidance exists, pilots will use the  best  charts  or  flight  planning  software  overlay  options  available  to  accomplish  the intent of maximizing traffic awareness and awareness of controlled airspace boundaries. (T-1). 2.5.5.  Digital  Terrain  System  (DTS)  and  Automatic  Ground  Collision  Avoidance  System (AGCAS).  F-16 mission planners will ensure RDTED coverage is adequate for the mission area and is  loaded to  each flight  member’s ADTC to  ensure maximum  AGCAS  protection. (T-1).  Without  appropriate  RDTED  coverage,  or  when  corrupted  data  is  present,  AGCAS still  provides  recovery  protection  to  50  feet  MSL,  however  this  may  not  prevent  potential ground collision when MSL elevation is higher. 2.5.6.  All qualified crewmembers will carry current and applicable checklists and pilot aids on every flight.  (T-1). 2.6.  Fuel  Conservation.  Pilots will manage aviation fuel as a limited commodity and precious resource;  design  procedures  for  optimal  fuel  use  and  efficiencies  throughout  all  phases  of mission execution, to include ground operations, flight  plans, power settings and climb/descent 10 AFI11-2F-16V3  13 JULY 2016 profiles.  (T-1).    Incorporate  enroute  tasks  to  make  maximum  use  of  airborne  learning opportunities. 2.7.  Overwater.  Flight  members  must  accomplish  planned  flights  over  water,  outside  of  the local  training  area  (e.g.,  deployments,  cross  countries,  Programmed  Delivery  for  Maintenance (PDM)  inputs,  etc.)  two-ship  as  a  minimum.    The  OG/CC  must  approve  all  single  ship  over water flights that are outside of the local training area. (T-3).  For deployments under ACC/AOS movement control, AFI 11-207 waiver authorities apply. 2.8.  Briefing and Debriefing. 2.8.1.  All  flight  members  will  attend  the  briefing  unless  previously  coordinated  with unit/squadron  supervisors.  (T-3).    Flight  leads  are  responsible  for  presenting  a  logical briefing to promote a safe and effective mission.  Structure flight briefings to accommodate the capabilities of each pilot in the flight.  Any item published in CAF/wing/group/squadron standards or AFIs and understood by all participants may be briefed as "standard." 2.8.2.  Flight leads must plan adequate time to discuss required briefing items depending on complexity  of  the  mission  and  pilot  capabilities, and  start  flight  briefings  at  least  1.5  hours before scheduled takeoff.  (T-1).  Flight leads will start alert briefings in sufficient time to be completed prior to pilot changeover. (T-1).  Items may be briefed in any sequence, provided all  minimum  requirements  listed  in  this  AFI  and  AFI  11-202V3  are  addressed.    Additional time  and  CRM  emphasis  is  necessary  in  D-model  sorties  especially  on  FAM  and  Incentive flights.      Passenger  must  demonstrate  oxygen  regulator  use,  ability  to  establish  multiple airways  and  mask  removal  after  being  strapped  in.    (T-1).    Reference  Attachment  3  for example briefing guides. Flight leads will include the following for all flight briefings: (T-1). 2.8.2.1.  Weather and NOTAMs. 2.8.2.2.  Emergency procedures. 2.8.2.3.  Mission priorities and task management. 2.8.2.4.  Significant rules (e.g. SPINS, Training Rules, ROE). 2.8.2.5.  Flight  member  responsibilities  and  deconfliction  contracts.    Flight  leads  will brief a formation deconfliction/blind/get well plan for every phase of flight. (T-1). 2.8.3.  Flight leads will emphasize the following for all low-level briefings: (T-1). 2.8.3.1.  Obstacle/terrain acquisition and avoidance, bird hazards, emergency actions and weather avoidance with route abort procedures. 2.8.3.2.  Employment  of  all Collision Avoidance Advisories and Digital  Terrain  System warnings to include AGCAS. 2.8.3.3.  Human  factors  to  include  task  prioritization,  G-excess  illusion,  and  perceptual issues associated with flight over water/featureless terrain. 2.8.3.4.  Airfield approach control frequencies in the vicinity of class B/C/D airspace as well as the intersection of other VR/IR routes or other areas of conflict. 2.8.4.  Dissimilar Formation Briefing.  Flight leads must emphasize proper position to ensure wingtip clearance,  flight member responsibilities, and aircraft-unique requirements for  each phase of flight. (T-1). AFI11-2F-16V3  13 JULY 2016 11 2.8.5.  Alternate Mission/Events and Multiple Go Days. Flight leads will: 2.8.5.1.  Brief  an  alternate  mission  for  each  flight  that  is  less  complex  than  the  primary mission. (T-1).   Flight leads will ensure unbriefed missions/events are not flown. (T-1).  Mission  elements  may  be  modified  and  briefed  airborne  as  long  as  flight  safety  is  not compromised.  Flight leads will ensure changes are acknowledged by all flight members. (T-1).  Continuation training (CT) missions may fly primary or alternate missions in any sequence. 2.8.5.2.  During  deployed  operations,  exercises,  or  multiple-go  days  when  aircraft  turn times do not allow follow-on mission brief(s), if all flight members attend an initial flight brief, the flight lead need only brief any changes for subsequent flights. 2.8.5.3.  On  multiple-go  days,  subsequent  missions  are  of  equal  or  less  complexity.  Continuation  training  (CT)  missions  may  fly  primary  or  alternate  missions  in  any sequence.  Units will schedule and plan upgrade events on the first sortie only. (T-1).  If that  sortie  is  non-effective  for  weather,  maintenance  or  airspace,  IPs  may  elect  to accomplish the planned upgrade events in the second sortie. 2.8.6.  Debriefing. 2.8.6.1.  Flight  leads  will  ensure  all  missions  are  debriefed  and  address  in-flight execution,  flight  member  responsibilities,  deconfliction  contracts,  tactical  employment priorities, and sensor management. (T-1). 2.8.6.2.  Flight  leads  will  review  the  video/audio  record  of  all  tactical  portions  of  the sortie to assess flight members’ AGSM effectiveness.  (T-1).  It is imperative to evaluate not only during the G-ex, but also after the pilot has had time to fatigue--typically when the  AGSM  breaks  down  and  G-induced  Loss  of  Consciousness  (GLOC)  occurs.    Pilots with  poor  AGSM  technique  or  low  G-tolerance  will  be  identified  to  the  operations officer.  (T-1).  The squadron commander has the option of directing refresher centrifuge training in accordance with AFI 11-404, Centrifuge Training for High-G Aircrew. 2.9.  Unit  Developed  Checklists/Local  Pilot  Aids.  Unit  developed  checklists  used  in  lieu  of flight  manual  checklists  must  contain  all  items,  verbatim  and  in  order,  unless  specifically addressed in the flight manual.  (T-1).   OGV will ensure pilot aids contain the following items: (T-1). 2.9.1.  Briefing guides (reference Attachment 3 for examples). 2.9.2.  Local radio channelization. 2.9.3.  Appropriate airfield diagrams, to include cable/net barrier information. 2.9.4.  Emergency  information  (impoundment  procedures,  emergency  action  checklists, NORDO procedures, divert information, search and rescue procedures, etc). 2.9.5.  Divert base cable and barrier information. 2.9.6.  Bailout and jettison areas. 2.9.7.  Cross-country  procedures  to  include:  command  and  control,  engine  documentation, Joint Oil Analysis Program (JOAP) samples, and aircraft servicing. 12 AFI11-2F-16V3  13 JULY 2016 2.9.8.  Other  information  as  desired  such  as:  stereo  flight  plans,  turn  procedures,  local training areas, instrument preflight, and alert setup procedures. Section 2B—Night (see also night sections Chapter 3, Chapter 5 and Chapter 6 2.10.  Minimum  Safe  Altitude  (MSA).  Pilots  will  compute  the  MSA  for  each  leg  of  the intended route of flight in accordance with AFI 11-214. 2.11.  Night chart requirements.  Pilots must comply with the minimum requirement of a Form 70  or  chart/map  containing  headings,  RAAs,  MSAs,  and  maximum/minimum  route  structure altitudes. (T-1). 2.12.  Video/Audio  Recording.  Pilots  will  operate  the  DVADR/DVR  to  the  maximum  extent possible without negatively impacting mission accomplishment and debrief. (T-1). AFI11-2F-16V3  13 JULY 2016 13 Chapter 3 NORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES Section 3A—Ground Operations 3.1.  Preflight. Pilots must: 3.1.1.  [B/D model aircraft] Place the stick control switch in the FWD position when the rear cockpit is occupied by other than a fully qualified F-16 pilot. (T-1). 3.1.2.  Not  carry  baggage/equipment  in  an  unoccupied  rear  cockpit;  in  the  avionics  bay behind the cockpit; or in the aft canopy fixed transparency area (turtle back). (T-1). 3.1.3.  Not place objects in or on top of the engine intake. (T-1). 3.1.4.  Secure  publications,  maps  and  personal  items  to  avoid  flight  control/  throttle interference. (T-1). 3.1.5.  Select  Pressure  Breathing  (PBG)  except  when  using  Aircrew  Eye  and  Respiratory Protection System (AERPS) or Aircrew Chemical Defense Equipment (ACDE). (T-1). 3.1.6.  Remove the port plug on the CRU-94/120 (if installed), if flying with the COMBAT EDGE  vest,  and  stow  the  plug  during  flight  to  prevent  a  FOD  hazard,  then  re-install  upon completion of the sortie. (T-1). 3.1.7.  Ensure ejection seat survival kit deployment switch is in the automatic position. (T-1). 3.1.8.  Not select CAT I on the Stores Configuration Switch with Category III configurations IAW T.O. 1F-16-1-2. (T-1). 3.2.  Ground  Visual  Signals.  Normally,  pilot  and  ground  crew  communicate  by  the  intercom system  during  all  start-engine,  pre-taxi  and  end  of  runway  (EOR)  checks.    Pilots  and  ground crew  must  use  the  intercom  system  to  the  maximum  extent  possible  anytime  maintenance technicians are performing "redballs" on the aircraft and for EPU checks performed in congested areas.  (T-1). Pilots will not actuate any system which endangers ground crew prior to receiving acknowledgment. (T-1).  Units with an active air defense commitment may waive use of ground intercom during alert scrambles.   When ground intercom is not used, pilots and ground crew will use  visual  signals  in  accordance  with  AFI  11-218,  Aircraft  Operation  and  Movement  on  the Ground, and this volume.  (T-1). The crew chief will repeat the given signal  when it is safe to operate the system. (T-1). 3.2.1.  Pilots and ground crew must use the following signals that augment AFI 11-218. (T-1). 3.2.1.1.  EPU OPERATIONAL CHECK.  Raise two fingers and rotate hand. 3.2.1.2.  FLIGHT  CONTROLS  CLEAR.    Raise  arm,  clench  fist,  and  make  a  stirring motion. 3.2.1.3.  BRAKE  CHECK.    Hold  left  or  right  arm  horizontal,  open  hand  and  push forward, breaking at the wrist (as in applying rudder pedal pressure with feet). 3.2.1.4.  LOSS OF BRAKES WHILE TAXIING.  Lower tailhook. 14 AFI11-2F-16V3  13 JULY 2016 3.2.1.5.  GUN  ARMAMENT  CHECK.    Point  index  finger  forward  with  thumb  upward simulating a pistol and shake head (yes or no). 3.2.1.6.  EPU ACTIVATION.  Raise hand with palm open and perform shoving motion indicating "stay away."  Then cup hands over oxygen mask indicating hydrazine vapors may be present. 3.3.  Taxi and Arming. 3.3.1.  Taxi Interval/Speed.  Minimum taxi interval is 150 feet staggered or 300 feet in trail.  Spacing  may  be  reduced  when  holding  short  of  or  entering  the  runway.    Unless  mission requirements dictate, pilots will limit taxi speed to 30 knots, 15 knots over a raised cable, and 10 knots in turns. (T-1). 3.3.2.  Ice/Snow Conditions.  Pilots will not taxi during ice and/or snow conditions until all portions of the taxi route and runway have been checked for safe conditions.   (T-1).  When ice and/or snow are present on the taxiway, pilots will taxi on the centerline with a minimum of 300 feet spacing.  (T-1).  Minimum RCR for taxi is 10. 3.3.3.  Ice  FOD  Procedures.    The  following  procedures  apply  when  the  conditions  in  T.O. 1F-16-1 indicate engine damage due to icing is possible. 3.3.3.1.  If  conditions  warrant,  the  Supervisor  of  Flying  (SOF)/Top  3  will  have  the  first flight lead start 5 minutes early to check for inlet ice formation. (T-3). 3.3.3.2.  Pilots must position ANTI ICE switch to ON prior to engine start. (T-1). 3.3.3.3.  An  ice  FOD  monitor  must  be  available  to  monitor  the  engine  inlet  for  ice buildup whenever the aircraft is stopped for an extended period of time (i.e. ramp/shelter and EOR).  (T-1).  Avoid standing water and snow/slush accumulations. 3.3.3.4.  Pilots  must  hold  in  the  arming  spot  with  an  ice  FOD  monitor  present  until cleared for take-off. (T-1). 3.3.3.5.  Pilots  must  shutdown  immediately  if  icing  is  visually  detected  and  notify  the SOF/Top  3.    (T-1).  Make  an  appropriate  entry  in  the  aircraft  forms  and  qualified personnel must accomplish an intake inspection prior to restarting the engine. (T-1). 3.3.4.  EPU  Check.    Pilots  will  not  allow  maintenance  technicians  to  approach  the  aircraft until the EPU check is complete.  (T-1).  Pilots must use intercom or a "thumbs up" signal to indicate when safe. (T-1). 3.4.  EOR Inspections and Before Takeoff Checks.  Pilots will place hands in view of ground personnel  while  the  quick  check  inspection  and/or  arming/de-arming  are  in  progress.    (T-1).  If the intercom system is not used during EOR checks, the pilot will establish and maintain visual contact  with  the  chief  and  use  visual  signals.    (T-1).    Pilots  must  ensure  EOR  inspections  are accomplished immediately prior to  takeoff at  a designated location, usually near the end of the runway  or  while  departing  the  chock  area  (not  required  for  alert  scrambles).    (T-1).    At  non-USAF  bases,  pilots  will  make  every  attempt  to  coordinate  an  EOR  inspection  with  the  host maintenance unit. (T-1). 3.4.1.  Forward  Firing  Ordnance.    Pilots  will  not  taxi  in  front  of  aircraft  being  armed/de-armed with forward firing ordnance. (T-1). AFI11-2F-16V3  13 JULY 2016 15 3.4.2.  Flight  members  will abnormalities. (T-1). inspect  each  other  for  proper  configuration  and  any 3.5.  Flight Lineup.  Consider weather conditions, runway conditions, and runway width. Pilots must  comply  with  minimum  spacing  between  separated  elements/flights  of  500  feet.    (T-1). Wingmen  must  maintain  wingtip  clearance  with  their  element  lead.  (T-1).  If  runway  width permits, pilots will lineup with wingtip clearance between all aircraft in the flight. (T-1). Section 3B—Takeoff and Departure 3.6.  Takeoff.  Pilots will: 3.6.1.  Not takeoff when the RCR is less than 10. (T-1). 3.6.2.  Review  takeoff  data  with  emphasis  on  takeoff  and  abort  factors  such  as  short/wet runway, heavy gross weights, cable configurations, and abort sequence in formation flights. (T-1). 3.6.3.  On  training  missions,  not  takeoff  if  the  computed  takeoff  roll  exceeds  80  percent  of the available runway single ship or 70 percent for a formation takeoff. (T-1). 3.6.4.  Ensure  a  compatible  departure  end  cable  is  raised  for  all  takeoffs  and  landings (including remotely operated cables).  (T-3). 3.6.5.  Get OG/CC approval for intersection takeoffs if operational requirements dictate. 3.6.6.  Make an afterburner takeoff anytime the computed MIL power takeoff roll exceeds 50 percent of the available runway. (T-1). 3.6.7.  Centerline  Stores:  start  the  takeoff  roll  beyond  a  raised  approach  end  cable  unless runway length, runway conditions (wet/icy), winds, gross weight or cable availability dictate otherwise.  (T-3).    Exception:  aircraft  with  a  centerline  mounted  fuel  tank  or  a  centerline mounted AN/ALQ-188 pod may takeoff across approach end BAK-12 arrestment cables with an 8-point tie down system. 3.6.8.  Comply  with  minimum  takeoff  interval  between  aircraft/elements  of  10  seconds  (15 seconds  for  afterburner).    (T-1).    Pilots  will  increase  interval  to  20  seconds  minimum  for join-up on top or when carrying live air-to-surface ordnance (excluding BDU-33s and 20mm ammunition). (T-1). 3.6.9.  Steer the aircraft/element toward the center of the runway after releasing brakes.  (T-1). 3.6.10.  Formation Takeoff. Aircraft/elements will: 3.6.10.1.  Restrict formation takeoffs to two aircraft. (T-1). 3.6.10.2.  Not make formation takeoffs when: 3.6.10.2.1.  Runway width is less than 125 feet. 3.6.10.2.2.  Standing water, ice, slush or snow is on the runway. 3.6.10.2.3.  The crosswind or gust component exceeds 15 knots. 16 AFI11-2F-16V3  13 JULY 2016 3.6.10.2.4.  Loaded  with  live  munitions  (excluding  air-to-air  missiles,  BDU-33s, 20mm ammunition, 2.75 rockets, AGM-88, AGM-65, and night illumination flares). 3.6.10.2.5.  Ferrying aircraft from contractor/AFMC facilities. 3.6.10.2.6.  Asymmetric  loading  or  a  difference  of  more  than  2,500  pounds  gross weight. 3.7.  Initial Join-up and Rejoins.  Aircraft/elements will: 3.7.1.  Comply  with  the  minimums  of  1,500  foot  ceiling  and  3  miles  (5  km)  visibility  for VFR join-ups below a ceiling. (T-1). 3.7.2.  Maintain  350  knots  indicated  air  speed  (KIAS)  until  join-up  is  accomplished  unless mission  requirements  necessitate  a  different  airspeed.    (T-1).  Pilots  may  delay  AB cancellation  to  establish  closure  on  lead  or  lead  element.    OG/CCs  may  approve  different climb and cruise airspeeds within dash one limits. 3.7.3.  Accomplish  battle  damage  (BD)/bomb  check  on  RTB,  when  practical  (i.e.,  weather prohibits  accomplishing  BD  check).  (T-1).  Aircraft/elements  are  required  to  complete  this check after expending any ordnance (including 20mm ammunition). (T-1). 3.7.4.  Accomplish air-to-air systems checks above 10,000 feet MSL when practical. (T-1). 3.7.5.  For  further  join-up  procedures,  see  Night  Operational  Procedures  (Section  3E)  and Instrument Procedures (Chapter 4). Section 3C—Enroute 3.8.  Air Refueling. 3.8.1.  Pilots  undergoing  initial  or  recurrency  training  in  air  refueling  will  not  refuel  with  a student boom operator.  (T-1).  Lead/IP will announce when an upgrade or requal pilot is in the formation and request a qualified (non-student) boomer. (T-1). 3.8.2.  Pilots will inform boom operator when refueling from particular tanker type (e.g., KC-10, KC-135, or KC-46) for the first time. (T-1). 3.8.3.  Quick  flow  procedures  are  authorized  and  pilots  will  conduct  them  IAW  ATP-56B and AFTTP 3-3.F-16. (T-1). 3.9.  Aircraft  Handling  Characteristics  (AHC)  and  Automated  Recovery  Training  Series (ARTS)/Maneuvering Parameters. 3.9.1.  Pilots  will  comply  with  the  following  minimum  altitudes  for  the  prescribed maneuvers: 3.9.1.1.  Confidence  Maneuvers/Advanced  Handling  -  10,000  feet  AGL,  except  dive recovery maneuver (15,000 feet AGL minimum entry altitude). (T-1). 3.9.1.2.  Horn  Awareness  and  Recovery  Training  series  (HARTS)  numbers  1,  2  and  3  - 10,000 feet AGL. (T-1). 3.9.1.3.  HARTS series numbers 4 and 5 - 15,000 feet AGL. (T-1). 3.9.1.4.  Not descend below 5,000 feet AGL during aerobatic maneuvering. (T-1). AFI11-2F-16V3  13 JULY 2016 17 3.9.1.5.  HARTS 3 with PARS – 10,000 feet AGL.  (T-1). 3.9.1.6.  ARTS 2 – 8,000 feet AGL.  (T-1). 3.9.1.7.  ARTS series number 1, 3, 4, and 5 – 5,000 feet AGL.  (T-1). 3.9.2.  Pilots must avoid flight through wingtip vortices/jet wash. (T-1).  If unavoidable, the aircraft should be unloaded immediately to approximately 1 G. 3.9.3.  Pilots will not manually extend the trailing edge flaps in an attempt to improve aircraft performance.  (T-1).  EXCEPTION:  Trailing  edge  flaps  may  be  manually  extended  during intercepts performed by airspace control alert tasked unit aircraft, or during low/slow (below 5,000 feet AGL) VID training, on targets traveling at less than 200 KIAS. 3.9.4.  Pilots will not attempt to bypass flight control limiters to improve performance.  (T-1). Examples are:  transfer fuel to alter center of gravity (CG), manual pitch override (MPO) to gain additional negative G or assaulting two limiters at low airspeed. 3.9.5.  The minimum airspeed for all maneuvering is based upon activation of the low speed warning tone.  When the low speed warning tone sounds, the pilot will take action to correct the low speed condition. (T-1). 3.9.6.  The  following  is  guidance  for  Horn  Awareness  and  Recovery  Training  Series (HARTS) (reference AFTTP 3-3.F-16): 3.9.6.1.  Pilots will fly HARTS maneuvers in CAT-1 loaded aircraft only. (T-1). 3.9.6.2.  In F-16 C/D Block 40-52 aircraft, pilots will not fly HARTS maneuvers 4 and 5 unless in one of the following configurations:  Clean (no tanks), or 300 gallon centerline tank. MAU-12s may be carried on stations 3 and 7, and/or AIM-9/AMDs/ACMI/CATM-120s  may  be  carried  on  stations  1,  2,  8  and/or  9.    Pilots  must  ensure  CATM-120s  are symmetrically  loaded  if  carried.  (T-1).  AIM-9/AMD/ACMI  can  be  symmetric  or  one missile asymmetric.  Inlet mounted TGP and/or HTS pods may be carried. 3.9.6.3.  For all F-16 Blocks, external tanks should be dry to avoid a faster than expected airspeed bleed-off due to excessive weight during the pull up, for all HARTS maneuvers. 3.9.7.  The  following  is  guidance  for  Automated  Recovery  Training  Series  (ARTS)  for AGCAS/  Pilot  Activated  Recovery  System  (PARS)  recovery  profiles  (reference  AFTTP3-3.F-16): 3.9.7.1.  With  exception  of  the  HARTS  3  with  PARS  maneuver,  AGCAS/PARS  demo maneuvers may be flown in any aircraft configuration unless concern for over-G exists.  However, a CAT I loading is preferred to demonstrate the full maneuvering potential of the  automated  recovery  system.  The  potential  for  over-G  exists  if  any  Nose-low  PARS maneuver  is  performed  when  the  aircraft  configuration  has  a  symmetric  G-limit  of  less than 6.2 G CAT I or 5.2 G CAT III. 3.9.7.2.  Pilots  will  not  demonstrate  AGCAS  recoveries  by  executing  dive  maneuvers toward  the  ground.  (T-1).    AGCAS  is  designed  to  provide  a  minimal  buffer  above  the ground during recovery and pilots must not intentionally activate it. (T-1). 3.10.  Formation,  General.  Flight  leads  and  instructors  will  ensure  contracts,  roles  and responsibilities  of  each  flight  member  are  established,  briefed,  executed  and  debriefed.  (T-1). 18 AFI11-2F-16V3  13 JULY 2016 Flight  members will immediately notify lead if unable to  fulfill  basic responsibilities, contracts or  other  assigned  tasks.    (T-1).  Flight  leads  will  avoid  tasking  element  leads/wingmen  beyond their  abilities  without  sacrificing  basic  responsibilities.    (T-1).  Reference  AFTTP  3-3.F-16  and AFTTP 3-1.F-16. 3.10.1.  The flight lead is always responsible for flight actions. Wingmen will be prepared to take the lead when directed. (T-1). 3.10.2.  In IMC, pilots will comply with the maximum flight size in visual formation of four aircraft except when flying in close formation with a tanker. (T-1). 3.10.3.  Pilots will not use rolling maneuvers to maintain or regain formation position below 5,000 feet AGL or in airspace where aerobatics are prohibited. (T-1). 3.10.4.  Pilots  must  use  airborne  visual  signals  in  accordance  with  AFI  11-205,  Aircraft Cockpit  and  Formation  Flight  Signals,  or  detailed  in  local  procedures.    (T-1).    Pilots  must initiate configuration changes for four-ship flights by radio call, when practical. (T-1).  When formation  position  changes  are  directed  by  radio,  all  wingmen  will  acknowledge  prior  to initiating the change.  (T-1).  Pilots must make a radio call when directing position changes at night or under instrument conditions. (T-1). 3.10.5.  Flight leads will not break up flights from visual or sensor formations until each pilot has a fix from which to navigate (visual, radar, INS or TACAN). (T-1). 3.10.6.  Lead changes. Pilots will: 3.10.6.1.  Comply  with  the  minimum  altitude  for  changing  leads  within  a  formation  of 500  feet  AGL  over  land  or  1,000  feet  AGL  over  water  [see  also  Night  Operational Procedures (Section 3E)].  (T-1). 3.10.6.2.  Initiate  lead  changes  from  a  stabilized,  wings  level  attitude  during  limited visibility conditions (e.g., night, IMC).  See also Night Operational Procedures (Section 3E) and Instrument Procedures (Chapter 4). (T-1). 3.10.6.3.  Not initiate lead changes with the wingman further back than normal fingertip or route position, or greater than 30 degrees back from line abreast. (T-1). 3.11.  G-Awareness Exercises (G-Ex) (Reference AFTTP 3-3.F-16 and AFI 11-214). 3.11.1.  Pilots  must  accomplish  a  G-Ex  if  planned  maneuvering  exceeds  5G.  (T-1).    Pilots will  accomplish  the  G-Ex  day  or  night,  only  in  VMC,  with  a  discernible  horizon,  and  only when unaided or NVG-aided visual cues are adequate to safely perform the maneuver.  (T-1). If these requirements  are not  met, pilots must omit the G-Ex and reduce mission tasking to limit maneuvering to 5G. (T-1). 3.11.2.  Unless performing a syllabus required event (e.g., chase of a G-Ex), flight members will follow AFTTP 3-3.F-16 G-Awareness Exercise Procedures.  (T-1).  Pilots use on-board systems  (e.g.  air-to-air TACAN, Radar, data link) to  establish separation  prior to  maneuver execution. (T-1). 3.11.3.  Pilots must conduct the G-Ex in order of preference listed below to help ensure the airspace is clear from potential traffic conflicts. (T-1).  If practical, use ATC to help clear the airspace: AFI11-2F-16V3  13 JULY 2016 19 3.11.3.1.  Special  Use  Airspace  (e.g.,  Restricted/Warning  areas,  Air  Traffic  Control Assigned  Airspace scale exercise/special mission areas). (ATCAA),  MOAs  and  MAJCOM  approved large 3.11.3.2.  In VFR only above 10,000 feet MSL outside of special use airspace. 3.11.3.3.  In VFR only inside the confines of a Military Training Route (MTR). 3.11.3.4.  In VFR only below 10,000 feet MSL outside of special use airspace. 3.11.4.  Flight/element  leads  flying  outside  of  CONUS  will  follow  gaining  MAJCOM, theater or host nation guidance on airspace in which G-Ex may be performed. (T-1).    If no such guidance exists, follow the above procedures to the maximum practical extent. 3.12.  Tactical Formations. 3.12.1.  Tactical  Maneuvering.    Wingmen/elements  must  maneuver  relative  to  the  flight lead/lead  element  and  maintain  sight.    (T-1).  Trailing  aircraft/elements  are  responsible  for deconflicting with lead aircraft/elements and will do so vertically when required.  (T-1).  At low  altitude,  wingmen/trailing  elements  will  deconflict  high.   Trailing aircraft/element(s)  will  maintain  sufficient  spacing  so  that  primary  emphasis  during formation maneuvering/turns is on low altitude awareness and deconfliction within elements, not  on  deconfliction  between  elements.    (T-1).  Normally,  the  wingman  is  responsible  for flight path deconfliction, but the flight/element lead will be primarily responsible when: (T-1). (T-1). 3.12.1.1.  Tactical  maneuvering  places  the  leader  well  aft  of  the  wingman’s  3/9  line  or forces  the  wingman’s  primary  attention  away  from  the  leader  (e.g.,  wingman  becomes engaged fighter). 3.12.1.2.  The wingman calls "padlocked". 3.12.1.3.  The wingman calls “blind”.  Primary deconfliction responsibility transfers back to the wingman once the wingman acknowledges a visual on his lead. 3.12.2.  Loss of Visual (“Blind”) Procedures. 3.12.2.1.  Flight  members  will  call  blind  with  an  altitude  to  the  hundreds  of  feet,  i.e., “Blind 16.9”.  (T-1).  The visual flight member will respond with “visual” and talk eyes on. (T-1). 3.12.2.2.  If the other flight member is also “Blind,” they will call blind with an altitude.  (T-1).  Lead  will  be  directive  to  ensure  altitude  separation  is  maintained  and  direct  the wingman’s flow direction.   (T-1).    Use a minimum of 500 feet (1,000 feet above 5,000 feet AGL) altitude separation.  Avoid climbs/descents through the deconfliction altitude.  All flight members must visually clear their flight path. (T-1). 3.12.2.3.  If there is no timely acknowledgment of the original "Blind 16.9" call, then the flight  member/element  initiating  the  call  will  maneuver  away  from  the  last  known position  of  the  other  flight  member/element  and  climb/descend  if  necessary.    (T-1).  If visual  contact  is  still  not  regained,  the  flight  lead  will  take  additional  positive  action  to ensure flight path deconfliction.  (T-1).    Scenario restrictions such as sanctuary altitudes and/or adversary blocks need to be considered. 20 AFI11-2F-16V3  13 JULY 2016 3.12.3.  Sensor  formations.  If  situational  awareness  (SA)  is  lost  or  “Blind”  in  a  sensor formation,  pilots  must  call  “Blind”  with  altitude  and  follow  the  above  procedures.    (T-1). Wingmen will strive to maintain an altitude stack at all times in sensor formation. (T-1). 3.13.  Chase Formation. 3.13.1.  Restrictions.    Any  pilot  may  fly  safety  chase  for  aircraft  under  emergency  or impending  emergency  conditions.    All  chase  events  may  be  flown  by  IP/Flight  Examiners (FEs)  or  upgrading  IPs  under  the  supervision  of  an  IP.    Pilots  who  have  successfully completed an Instrument/Qualification evaluation) may chase as safety observer for aircraft performing simulated instrument flight or hung ordnance patterns.  Specialized missions (i.e., OT&E,  Weapon  System  Evaluation  Program  (WSEP),  live  weapons  delivery,  etc)  and training conducted IAW AFI 11-2F-16V1, F-16--Pilot Training, may be chased by Combat Mission  Ready  (CMR)/Basic  Mission  Capable  (BMC)  pilots  designated  by  group/squadron commanders. 3.13.2.  Procedures.  (See AFTTP 3-3.F-16) 3.13.2.1.  On transition  sorties, the  chase aircraft  will perform a single-ship  takeoff.  (T-1).    In-flight,  the  chase  aircraft  maneuvers  as  necessary,  but  must  maintain  nose-tail separation. (T-1). The chase will not stack lower than lead aircraft below 1,000 feet AGL. (T-1).    In  the  traffic  pattern,  the  chase  aircraft  may  maneuver  as  necessary  to  observe performance. 3.13.2.2.  A safety observer in chase will maneuver in a 30-60 degree cone with nose/tail clearance out to a range of 1,000 feet, from which he can effectively clear and/or provide assistance. (T-3). 3.13.2.3.  For  live  ordnance  missions,  the  chase  pilot  must  ensure  frag  deconfliction  for his aircraft. (T-1). 3.14.  Show  Formation.  Mission  planners  will  refer  to  AFI  11-209,  Aerial  Event  Policy  & Procedures,  and  applicable  MAJCOM  or  ANG  directives  for  specific  rules  and  appropriate approval levels to participate in static displays and aerial events. 3.14.1.  AGCAS  SHOW  mode  may  be  selected  only  if  operating  IAW  MAJCOM  or  ANG approved aerial events. 3.15.  Low Altitude Operations (reference AFTTP 3-1.F-16 and AFTTP 3-3.F-16). 3.15.1.  Airspeed and Altitude.  Pilots will comply with the minimum airspeed for low level navigation  of  300  KIAS  and  the  minimum  altitude  of  1,000  feet  AGL  (or  IAW  approved step-down  training).  (T-1).    For  night  or  IMC  operation,  pilots  will  comply  with  the minimum  altitude  of  the  MSA  (see  AFI  11-214)  unless  operating  under  NVG  LOWAT Procedures. (T-1). 3.15.2.  At low altitude, pilots will immediately climb to a prebriefed safe altitude (minimum 1,000  feet  AGL)  when  experiencing  task  saturation,  diverted  attention,  knock-it-off,  or emergencies. (T-1). 3.15.2.1.  When a “PULL-UP-PULL-UP” warning sounds, the pilot will take immediate action to ensure terrain clearance, while referencing the primary flight instruments. (T-1). AFI11-2F-16V3  13 JULY 2016 21 3.15.2.2.  F-16’s with pilot-selectable GCAS Minimum Terrain Clearance (MTC) settings will  set  an  altitude  that  does  not  result  in  “PULL-UP”  warnings  at  normal  operational altitudes.    (T-1).  Pilots  will  comply  with  the  minimum  MTC  of  50  feet  for  strafe  and visual  bombing,  and  25  percent  of  LOWAT  Category  minimum  altitude  for  all  other operations. (T-1). Wings with significant tall trees in the operating area or VR routes will account for average tree height when setting MTC altitudes.  (T-1). 3.15.2.3.  F-16’s  equipped  with  an  operational  AGCAS  will  ensure  NORM  mode  is selected  prior  to  LOWAT  operations  down  to  500  feet  AGL  to  include  HAS  and  LAS events.  (T-1).  If operations are necessary below 500 feet AGL, AGCAS MIN mode may be selected to prevent nuisance fly-ups. 3.15.3.  Weather.  Consult FLIP for minimum weather on a VR or IR route.  For low altitude training outside the CONUS, pilots will comply with theater/host nation guidance. (T-1). 3.15.3.1.  Deteriorating weather on a VR Route. 3.15.3.1.1.  Able to maintain VMC.  If it becomes apparent that weather ahead does not  permit  continued  flight  on  the  VR,  pilots  will  maintain  VMC,  slow  down, maneuver to exit the route structure, and establish a VFR hemispheric altitude.  (T-0). 3.15.3.1.2.  Unable  to  maintain  VMC.    Pilots  will  climb  to  briefed  deconfliction altitudes  (reference  Paragraph  2.8).  (T-1).    Squawk  applicable  (IFF/SIF)  modes  and codes  and  contact  a  controlling  agency  to  pick  up  an  IFR  clearance  if  required.  Maintain preplanned ground track. 3.15.4.  Obstacle/Terrain  Avoidance.    If  unable  to  visually  acquire  or  ensure  lateral separation  from  known  vertical  obstructions  which  are  a  factor  to  the  route  of  flight,  flight leads  will  immediately  direct  a  climb  NLT  3  NM  prior  to  the  obstacle  to  an  altitude  that ensures vertical separation. (T-1). 3.15.5.  At  altitudes  below  1,000  feet  AGL,  wingmen  will  not  fly  at  a  lower  AGL  altitude than lead. (T-1). 3.15.6.  When crossing high or hilly terrain, pilots will maintain positive G on the aircraft and do not exceed 120 degrees of bank. (T-1).  Pilots will limit maneuvering at less than 1 G to upright bunting maneuvers. (T-1). Section 3D—Recovery and Landing 3.16.  Gear Checks.  For a VFR straight in, pilots will call gear down no later than 3 NM final.  (T-1).  For an instrument approach (reference Chapter 4), pilots will call gear down at the final approach  fix  or  published  glide  slope  intercept  point.  (T-1).    For  an  overhead,  call  gear  down departing the perch.  For a SFO or FO, pilots will call gear down at base key. (T-1). 3.17.  Angle  of  Attack  (AOA).  Final  approach  normally  is  flown  at  11  degrees  AOA.    Pilots will compare the computed final approach airspeed with AOA. (T-1). 3.18.  Landing  restrictions.  When  the  computed  landing  roll  exceeds  80  percent  of  the available runway, land at an alternate if possible.  When the RCR at the base of intended landing is less than 10, land at an alternate if possible.  Pilots will not land over any raised web barrier (e.g., MA-1A, 61QS11). (T-1). 22 AFI11-2F-16V3  13 JULY 2016 3.19.  Desired touchdown point and spacing. 3.19.1.  The  desired  touchdown  point  is  500  feet  from  the  aim  point.    The  aim  point  for  a VFR  approach  is  the  threshold.    The  aim  point  for  a  precision  approach  is  the  glide  path interception point.  To avoid possible speedbrake or nozzle damage, pilots will touch down either past a raised approach-end cable, or 500 feet prior to the cable. (T-1).  With centerline stores, touchdown is  normally past  an approach-end cable.  Circumstances that may dictate landing prior to the cable include runway length, wind, runway condition (wet or icy), gross weight  or  an  aircraft  malfunction  where  full  normal  braking  may  not  be  available.    Single-ship  or  formation  landings  with  centerline  stores  may  be  made  across  BAK-12  arrestment cables which have been modified with an 8-point-tie-down system. 3.19.2.  Pilots  will  comply  with  a  touchdown  spacing  behind  an  aircraft  while  flying  a  13 degree  approach  as  a  minimum  of  6,000  feet  due  to  susceptibility  of  the  aircraft  to  wake turbulence and speedbrake/tail scrapes. (T-1).  Pilots will comply with the minimum pattern and touchdown spacing between landing aircraft of 3,000 feet for similar aircraft (e.g., F-16 following  F-16),  6,000  feet  for  dissimilar  fighter  aircraft  (e.g.,  F-16  following  F-15)  or  as directed by MAJCOM or the landing base, whichever is higher. (T-1). 3.19.2.1.  When wake turbulence is expected due to calm winds (less than or equal to 5 knots)  or  when  landing  with  a  light  tail  wind,  pilots  will  comply  with  increased pattern/touchdown  spacing  to  6,000  feet  minimum.  (T-1).  Under  these  conditions, moderate  to  severe  wake  turbulence  has  been  reported  out  to  7,000  foot  touchdown spacing. 3.19.3.  All  aircraft  will  land  in  the  center  of  the  runway  and  clear  to  the  cold  side  when speed/conditions  permit.  (T-1).    After  achieving  a  safe  taxi  speed,  pilots  will  not  delay clearing to the cold side as this can create a conflict for subsequent landing aircraft. (T-1). 3.19.4.  When  an  F-16  aircraft  is  used  to  certify  a  BAK-12  interconnected  with  a  BAK-14 cable retraction system,  the minimum  engagement  speed will be 75 knots groundspeed  and the  maximum  engagement  speed  will  be  90  knots  groundspeed.    Pilots  should  place  the airspeed selection switch to GS for their crosscheck in the HUD during the certification.  As the F-16 engages a BAK-12/14 at a speed approaching and/or exceeding 100 knots, damage to  the  underside  of  the  F-16  aircraft  may  result.    For  actual  emergencies,  T.O.  limits  will apply. 3.20.  Low Approaches. 3.20.1.  Pilots will observe the following minimum altitudes: (T-1). 3.20.1.1.  IP/FEs flying chase position: 50 feet AGL. 3.20.1.2.  Formation low approaches: 100 feet AGL. 3.20.1.3.  Chase  aircraft  during  an  emergency:  300  feet  AGL  unless  safety  or circumstances dictate otherwise. 3.20.2.  During  go-around,  pilots  will  remain  500  feet  below  VFR  overhead  traffic  pattern altitude  until  crossing  the  departure  end  of  the  runway  unless  local  procedures,  missed approach/climbout procedures or controller instructions dictate otherwise. (T-1). AFI11-2F-16V3  13 JULY 2016 23 3.21.  Touch-and-Go  Landings.  Fly  touch-and-go  landings  IAW  AFI  11-202V3.    Pilots  will not fly them with live or hung external ordnance or with fuel remaining in any external tank. (T-1). 3.22.  Overhead  Traffic  Patterns.  Unless  the  OG/CC  determines  that  local  conditions  (e.g., threat  condition,  populated  areas)  dictate  otherwise,  pilots  will  not  fly  overhead  patterns  with unexpended heavy-weight ordnance (larger than BDU-33). (T-3). 3.23.  Tactical  Overhead  Traffic  Patterns.  Pilots  will  only  execute  tactical  entry  to  the overhead traffic pattern if the following conditions are met: (T-1). 3.23.1.  Published overhead pattern altitude and airspeed are used. 3.23.2.  Specific  procedures  have  been  developed  locally  and  coordinated  with  appropriate air traffic control agencies. 3.23.3.  The flight consists of a maximum of four aircraft (aircraft/elements more than 6,000 feet in trail are considered a separate flight). 3.23.4.  No aircraft offset from the runway in the direction of the break (the intent is to avoid requiring a tighter than normal turn to arrive on normal downwind). 3.23.5.  Normal downwind, base turn positions, and spacing are flown. 3.24.  Closed Traffic Patterns.  Pilots will initiate the pattern at the departure end of the runway unless  directed/cleared  otherwise  by  local  procedures  or  the  controlling  agency.  (T-1).    An element low approach may be followed by a sequential closed with controller approval.  Plan to arrive on downwind at 200-250 KIAS. 3.25.  Back Seat Approaches and Landings. 3.25.1.  An upgrading IP will only accomplish back seat landings when an IP is in the front cockpit. (T-1). 3.25.2.  During back seat approaches and landings, the front seat pilot will visually clear the area, monitor aircraft parameters/configurations and be prepared to direct a go-around or take control of the aircraft (as briefed by the rear cockpit IP) if necessary. (T-1). 3.26.  Formation Approaches and Landings. 3.26.1.  Aircraft must be symmetrically loaded.  (T-1). Consider symmetrical as those stores loadings  which  do  not  require  an  abnormal  trim  or  control  application  to  counter  a  heavy wing or yaw during takeoff and acceleration to climb airspeed. 3.26.2.  Elements  will  be  led  by  a  qualified  flight  lead  unless  an  IP  or  flight  lead  qualified squadron supervisor is in the element. (T-1). 3.26.3.  Pilots  will  use  a  rate  of  descent  similar  to  a  precision  approach.  Fly  a  published precision instrument approach if one is available. (T-1).  If not, pilots will fly a non-precision approach or VFR straight in and reference available lighting systems (e.g., VASI, PAPI) for descent angle. (T-1). 3.26.4.  If the crosswind exceeds 5 knots, lead will position the wingman on the upwind side. (T-1). 24 AFI11-2F-16V3  13 JULY 2016 3.26.5.  The wingman will maintain a minimum of 10 feet lateral wingtip spacing.  (T-1).  If the  wingman  overruns  lead  after  landing,  lead  will  accept  the  overrun  and  maintain  the appropriate side of the runway and wingtip clearance. (T-1).   Wingman will not attempt to reposition behind lead. (T-1). 3.26.6.  Pilots will not make formation landings when: (T-1). 3.26.6.1.  The crosswind or gust component exceeds 15 knots. 3.26.6.2.  The runway is wet or reported wet. 3.26.6.3.  There is ice, slush, or snow on the runway. 3.26.6.4.  The runway width is less than 125 feet. 3.26.6.5.  Arresting gear tape connectors extend onto the runway surface at the approach end of 125 feet wide runways (excluding overrun installations). 3.26.6.6.  Landing with hung ordnance or unexpended live bombs. 3.26.6.7.  The  weather  is  less  than  500  foot  ceiling  and  1.5  miles  visibility  (or  a  flight member's weather category, whichever is higher).  This applies to chased approaches and formation low approaches. Section 3E—Night (see also night sections Chapter 2, Chapter 5 and Chapter 6) 3.27.  General Night Procedures. 3.27.1.  Night  Ground  Operations.    The  anti-collision  (strobe)  light  may  be  OFF  and  the position  lights  STEADY  if  they  prove  to  be  a  distraction.    Pilots  will  comply  with  a  taxi spacing minimum of 300 feet and taxi on the centerline. (T-1).  Pilots will use the taxi light during all night taxiing. (T-1).  Exception:  When the light might interfere with the vision of the pilot of an aircraft landing or taking off, the taxiing aircraft will come to a stop if the area cannot be visually cleared without the taxi light. (T-1). 3.27.2.  Night Takeoff.  Aircraft will maintain the anti-collision light ON and position lights FLASH  for  takeoffs,  unless  IMC  is  anticipated  shortly  after  takeoff.  (T-3).  Exception:  For formation  takeoffs,  flight/element  leads  will  turn  the  anti-collision  light  OFF  and  position lights  STEADY  after  reaching  the  run-up  position  on  the  runway.  (T-1).  During  a  night formation  takeoff,  pilots  will  call  brake  release,  gear  retraction  and  AB  termination  on  the radio.  (T-1). Following takeoff, each aircraft/element will climb on runway heading to 1,000 feet  AGL  before  initiating  turns,  except  where  departure  instructions  specifically  preclude compliance. (T-3). 3.27.3.  Night  Join-up.  For  night  join-up  underneath  a  ceiling,  pilots  will  comply  with  the minimums  of  a  3,000  foot  ceiling  and  5  miles  visibility.    (T-1).    After  join-up,  pilots  must ensure:  the anti-collision light is OFF and position lights are STEADY for all except the last aircraft, which keeps the anti-collision light ON and position lights FLASH unless otherwise directed by the flight lead. (T-3). 3.27.4.  Position/Lead Changes.  Unless operating with NVGs, pilots will not change lead or wing positions below 1,500 feet AGL unless on radar downwind. (T-1).  Pilots will call such AFI11-2F-16V3  13 JULY 2016 25 changes  over  the  radio  and  initiate  them  from  a  stabilized,  wings-level  attitude  whenever possible. (T-1). 3.27.5.  Night  Break-up.    Prior  to  a  night  formation  break-up,  the  flight  lead  will  confirm position and transmit attitude, altitude, airspeed, and altimeter setting. (T-1).  Wingmen will acknowledge and confirm good navigational aids. (T-1). 3.27.6.  Night  Landing.    Land  from  the  most  precise  approach  available.  Pilots  will  only conduct night formation landings when required for safe recovery of the aircraft. (T-1). 3.28.  Night Vision Goggles (NVG) Procedures. 3.28.1.  NVG  Preflight.    NVGs  must  be  preflight  tested  and  adjusted/focused  for  the individual  pilot  using  (in  order  of  preference)  the  Hoffman  ANV-20/20  Tester,  a  unit  eye lane,  or  equivalent.    (T-1).  Reference  AFI  11-301V1,  Aircrew  Flight  Equipment  (AFE) Program. 3.28.2.  Cockpit Lighting.  Pilots will fly with NVGs only in aircraft whose cockpit lighting MAJCOM  designates  as  NVG  compatible.    (T-2).    MAJCOMs  will  only  make  such  a designation  if  all  control  and  performance  instruments  are  sufficiently  illuminated  by  the NVG-compatible lighting so as to make them immediately available to the pilot in the event they need to transition to instruments. that threat include  air-to-air/surface-to-air 3.28.3.  Weather/Visibility/Illumination  Levels/Minimum  Altitudes/Discernable  Horizon.  Reference AFI 11-214, AFTTP 3-3.F-16, and AFI 11-202V3.    All pilots conducting NVG operations reactions  or  air-to-ground dynamic/diving  deliveries  will  conduct  a  “30-Up  and  30-Down”  horizon  orientation maneuver  before  conducting  tactical  maneuvering.    (T-1).    Pilots  will  accomplish  this maneuver in VMC and above the MSA. (T-1).  It should be completed after the G-awareness exercise.  The  purpose  is  to  evaluate  horizon  conditions  and  practice  an  NVG  horizon orientation  and  crosscheck.    If  airspace  precludes  the  maneuver,  pilots  operating  on  NVGs will  limit  maneuvers  to  AFI11-214  “Restricted  Maneuvering”  guidelines.  (T-1).    Pilots adhere to the following guidelines when conducting the 30-Up and 30-Down maneuver: 3.28.3.1.  In  VMC  conditions  (with  a  discernible  horizon),  and  with  sufficient  altitude (~3,000-5,000  feet)  in  approved  operating  airspace,  pilots  will  accelerate  to  350  KIAS minimum and maintain a minimum spacing of 6,000 feet between aircraft throughout the maneuver.  (T-1).    The  flight  lead  will  announce,  “Standby  30-UP,  30-Down”  and communicate a reference heading prior to execution for flight deconfliction. (T-1).  Flight members  will  verify  correct  spacing,  heading,  and  entry  parameters  and  will communicate “stand by” if not ready. (T-1). 3.28.3.2.  Flight  leads  will  command  “30  Up,”  and  all  pilots  will  execute  a  military power, 3-4 G wings-level  pull up to  place the bore cross on the 30 degree pitch ladder. (T-1).    Pilots  will  evaluate  and  orient  themselves  with  the  horizon  in  the  forward quadrants, both above and below the horizon while maintaining intra-flight deconfliction contracts. (T-1).  Take note of the physical cranial movement required to move the NVG field of regard back to the horizon, as well as the condition of the horizon due to ambient factors.    If  at  any  time  the  airspeed  drops  below  250  KIAS,  weather  is  encountered,  or symptoms of spatial disorientation are recognized, the pilot will immediately transition to 26 AFI11-2F-16V3  13 JULY 2016 primary flight instruments, call a “knock it off (with reason),” and conduct an IMC nose-high recovery. (T-1). 3.28.3.3.  After  approximately  5  seconds,  or  sooner  if  airspace  or  altitude  restrictions require, the flight  lead will  command “roll left  (or right), 30 down”.  (T-1).  All  aircraft will roll inverted and accomplish the military power, 3-4 G wings-level pull to place the bore  cross  at  the  30  degree  nose-low,  then  roll  upright  on  the  reference  heading.  (T-1).  Once  intra-flight  deconfliction  is  assured,  pilots  will  repeat  the  horizon  crosscheck  and visibility assessment while maintaining the 30 degree-nose low attitude. (T-1). 3.28.3.4.  If  during  any  portion  of  the  maneuver  a  flight  member  determines  that  the visibility  or  horizon  reference  is  unsuitable  for  tactical  maneuvering  per  AFI-11-214 guidance, the flight lead will modify the training profile and either transition to non-NVG formations  or  NVG  formation  tactics  limited  to  AFI11-214  “Restricted  Maneuvering” guidelines.  (T-1).    Pilots  will  continually  modify  profiles  or  airspace  utilization throughout the sortie if conditions change and no longer permit the planned maneuvering. (T-1).  Flight training modification includes: restricted maneuvering limitations (with or without  NVGs)  per  AFI-11-214,  a  non-NVG  formation  IMC  game  plan,  or accomplishing a briefed alternate mission without NVGs. 3.28.3.5.  Pilots  will  continually  cross-check  visually  perceived  attitude  aided  by  NVGs with frequent cross-checks of primary flight instruments throughout the mission. (T-1). 3.28.4.  NVG  Qualifications.    Pilots  will  not  wear  NVGs  in  flight  unless  they  are  NVG qualified or a qualified NVG IP is in the flight (ratio of one NVG IP per non-NVG qualified pilot).  (T-1).    F-16B/D  Familiarization  flights  are  authorized  but  the  unit  must  ensure appropriate academics are accomplished and an NVG IP is in the front seat. (T-1). 3.28.5.  Radio  Calls.    All  flight  members  will  make  a  radio  call  when  donning,  raising,  or stowing NVGs. (T-1). 3.28.6.  Obstacle/Intra-Flight  Deconfliction.    When  flying  in  route,  only  one  flight  member per element will don/raise/stow NVGs at a time. (T-1).  Flight leads will call turns if forced to maneuver while flight members are donning/raising/stowing NVGs. (T-1). 3.28.7.  Takeoffs/Landings.  Pilots must stow or raise NVGs during takeoff until at or above 2,000 feet AGL in climbing or level flight and only in VMC. (T-1).  Pilots must stow or raise NVGs  no  later  than  5  minutes  prior  to  landing  unless  NVGs  are  necessary  to  handle  an emergency or mission requirements dictate. (T-1). 3.28.8.  NVG Use during Air to  Air Refueling  (AAR).  Pilots  must stow or raise  NVGs no later than the stern position and resume NVG use no earlier than boom disconnect. (T-1). Section 3F—Other 3.29.  Targeting  Pod  Operations  .    Pilots  will  not  use  the  TGP  for  anything  other  than navigational SA below 1,000 feet AGL (e.g., Only VID aircraft, designate for weapons delivery, etc. above 1,000 feet AGL).  (T-1).  (USAFWC, Test, and AATC: Minimum altitudes for TGP operations  are  established  in  WIC  or  test  syllabus  requirements,  continuation  training  plans  or operational test and evaluation requirements). AFI11-2F-16V3  13 JULY 2016 27 3.30.  Radio  Procedures.  Flight  members  must  preface  all  communications  with  the  complete flight  call  sign  (except  for  wingman  acknowledgment).  (T-1).    Flight  members  must  transmit only that information essential for mission accomplishment or safety of flight.  (T-1). 3.30.1.  Radio  Checks.    Flight  members  must  acknowledge  radio  checks,  which  do  not require the transmission of specific data by individual flight members, in turn (EXAMPLE:  "2, 3, 4"). (T-1).  Acknowledgment indicates the appropriate action is either complete, is in the process of being completed or is understood by the flight member. 3.30.2.  Clearance  Acknowledgement.    All  flight  members  will  acknowledge  understanding the initial air traffic control (ATC) clearance. (T-1).  If flight members are not monitoring in-flight  ATC  frequency,  the  flight  lead  will  pass  all  ATC  instructions  to  the  flight.  (T-1).  Flight  members will acknowledge subsequent  ATC  instructions when directed by the flight lead. (T-1). 3.30.3.  Flight  members  will  use  brevity  code  and  other  terminology  IAW  AFI  11-214  and AFTTP 3-1.General Planning, General Planning and Employment Considerations. (T-1). 3.30.4.  Ops Checks. 3.30.4.1.  Pilots will monitor the fuel system carefully to identify low fuel, trapped fuel or an  out  of  balance  situation  as  soon  as  possible.  (T-1).    Frequency  should  be  increased during tactical maneuvering at high power settings.  Pilots must complete the following ops checks: 3.30.4.1.1.  During climb or at level-off after takeoff. (T-1). 3.30.4.1.2.  When external fuel tanks (if carried) are empty. (T-1). 3.30.4.1.3.  Prior to each (D)ACBT engagement or intercept. (T-1). 3.30.4.1.4.  Prior  to  entering  an  air-to-surface  range,  once  while  on  the  range  if multiple passes are made and after departing the range. (T-1). 3.30.4.2.  Pilots must check the minimum items of engine instruments, total and internal fuel  quantities/balance,  G-suit  connection,  oxygen  system,  and  cabin  altitude.  (T-1).    If the  G-suit  malfunctions  or  becomes  disconnected,  pilots  will  terminate  all  ACBT maneuvering until normal operation is reestablished. (T-1). 3.30.4.3.  For  formation  flights,  the  flight  lead  will  initiate  ops  checks  by  radio  call  or visual signal.  (T-1).  Flight members will respond by radio call or visual signal. (T-1). 3.30.4.3.1.  During  Ops  checks,  pilots  will  ensure  the  fuel  quantity  selector  knob  is returned  to  the  NORM  position.    (T-1).  Totalizer-only  Ops  checks  may  be  used periodically during high demand phases of flight. 3.30.4.3.2.  For  mandatory  ops  checks  when  external  tanks  are  carried,  each  flight member  will  check  the  external  tank(s)  and  add  “Tank(s)  feeding/dry”  to  the  Ops Check.    (T-1).  Once  the  tank(s)  have  been  confirmed  and  called  dry,  this  may  be omitted from subsequent ops checks. 3.30.4.3.3.  Pilots will not substitute data-linked fuel status for operations checks. (T-1). 28 AFI11-2F-16V3  13 JULY 2016 3.31.  Lap Belts.  Use extreme caution when disconnecting the lap belt in flight due to potential for lap belt buckle/side-stick controller/throttle interference. 3.32.  Change of Aircraft Control.  Both pilots of an F-16B/D must know at all times who has control of the aircraft. (T-1).  Pilots will transfer control of the aircraft with the statement "You have the aircraft." (T-1).  The pilot receiving control of the aircraft will acknowledge "I have the aircraft."  (T-1).    Once  assuming  control  of  the  aircraft,  the  pilot  will  maintain  control  until relinquishing  it  as  stated  above.    (T-1).  Exception:    If  the  intercom  fails,  the  pilot  in  the  front cockpit (if not in control of the aircraft) will rock the wings and assume control of the aircraft, radios and navigational equipment unless briefed otherwise. (T-3). 3.33.  Fuel Requirements. 3.33.1.  Joker Fuel.   A briefed  fuel  quantity needed to  terminate  an event and proceed with the remainder of the mission. 3.33.2.  Bingo  Fuel.    A  briefed  fuel  state  which  allows  the  aircraft  to  return  to  the  base  of intended landing or alternate, if required, using preplanned recovery parameters and arriving with normal recovery fuel as listed below: 3.33.3.  Normal  Recovery  Fuel.    The  fuel  quantity  on  initial  or  at  the  FAF  at  the  base  of intended  landing  or  alternate,  if  required.    This  fuel  quantity  is  the  higher  of  what  is established locally or: 3.33.3.1.  All F-16 Blocks 10 through 32 - 1,000 pounds. 3.33.3.2.  All F-16 Blocks 40 and higher - 1,200 pounds. 3.33.4.  Minimum/Emergency  Fuel.    Pilots  will  declare  the  following  when  it  becomes apparent that an aircraft is entering initial or start an instrument final approach at the base of intended landing or alternate, if required, with: (T-1). 3.33.4.1.  Minimum Fuel: 3.33.4.1.1.  All F-16 Blocks 10 through 32 - 800 pounds or less. 3.33.4.1.2.  All F-16 Blocks 40 and higher - 1,000 pounds or less. 3.33.4.2.  Emergency Fuel: 3.33.4.2.1.  All F-16 Blocks 10 through 32 - 600 pounds or less. 3.33.4.2.2.  All F-16 Blocks 40 and higher - 800 pounds or less. 3.33.5.  Afterburner Use.  Pilots will not use AB below 2,000 pounds total fuel or established bingo fuel, whichever is higher, unless required for safety of flight. (T-1). 3.34.  Radar Altimeters and Terrain Warning/Avoidance Systems. 3.34.1.  If the aircraft is equipped with such systems (CARA, DTS, PGCAS, AGCAS, etc.), the pilot will turn them on for all flights and set LIS altitude advisory as appropriate on all missions. (T-1).  Pilots will enable PGCAS with a minimum altitude setting of 200 feet for day  operations  and  700  feet  for  night  operations.  (T-1).    Pilots  will  confirm  the  correct AGCAS mode (NORM/MIN/SHOW) is selected per mission requirements.  (T-1).  AGCAS should  only  be  turned  off  if  a  known  system  malfunction  affecting  safety  of  flight  requires system deactivation.  Pilots will ensure that the appropriate values are set prior to takeoff. (T-AFI11-2F-16V3  13 JULY 2016 29 1).    For  low  altitude  operations  GCAS  settings,  reference    3.15.2.2  and    3.15.2.3  in  this publication. 3.34.2.  Pilots must set the ALOW function of the radar altimeter and the LIS at the briefed minimum  altitude,  the  command-directed  minimum  altitude,  or  as  briefed,  whichever  is highest. (T-1).  They should be set at sufficient altitudes, during various phases of flight, to allow for safe recovery of the aircraft when activated. 3.34.3.  Prior  to  commencing  an  approach  during  night  or  IMC,  pilots  should  reset  the  LIS and/or  ALOW  warning  system  to  an  altitude  appropriate  to  the  instrument  approach procedure being flown or the general terminal area.  Refer to 1F-16C/CM-34-1-1 for warning limitations when the gear is down. 3.35.  Wind and Sea State Restrictions.  Pilots will not conduct training missions when surface winds  along  the  intended  route  of  flight  exceed  35  knots  steady  state.  (T-1).    Pilots  will  not conduct over water training missions when surface winds exceed 25 knots steady state or when the  sea  state  exceeds  10  feet  (or  4  meters-USAFE).    (T-3).    This  is  not  intended  to  restrict operations when only a small portion of the route is affected. 3.36.  Airborne Interrogator Friend Foe (AIFF) Operation. 3.36.1.  To  reduce  the  potential  for  adverse  effects  on  Combat  Identification,  Air  Traffic Control,  and  Traffic  Collision  Avoidance  systems,  pilots  will  limit  interrogations  to  the minimum required for the mission. (T-1). 3.36.2.  For AIFF operations within the United States and its Possessions (US&P), pilots will comply with the equipment and operational restrictions as specified in the applicable Radio Frequency  Authorizations  (RFA's)  which  can  be  obtained  from  the  unit  spectrum management office. (T-1). 30 AFI11-2F-16V3  13 JULY 2016 Chapter 4 INSTRUMENT PROCEDURES 4.1.  General. 4.1.1.  Head-Up  Display  (HUD)  Use.    Regardless  of  Block,  pilots  will  use  the  ADI  as  the primary  reference  to  recover  from  an  unusual  attitude  or  while  executing  lost  wingman procedures. (T-1).  The HUD should be used as a crosscheck in these situations.  The HUD in  F-16  Block  25/30/32  aircraft  and  Block  40/42/50/52  aircraft  has  been  certified  as  a primary  flight  instrument  and  may  be  used  as  a  primary  flight  reference  in  night/IMC conditions.    The  HUD  in  all  other  F-16  Blocks  may  be  used  as  an  additional  instrument reference  only.    No  F-16  Block  may  use  the  HUD  as  the  sole  reference  in  night/IMC conditions. 4.1.2.  The F-16 is approved for RNAV 2 and BRNAV for enroute navigation IAW with AC 90-108  change  1  and  ICAO  Doc  7030.    RNAV  waypoints,  routes  and  NAVAIDs  must  be pulled  from  the  approved  DAFIF  database  by  name.    Terminal  area  RNAV  procedures, (RNAV  approaches,  missed  approaches,  arrivals  and  departures)  are  not  authorized  until such a time as the procedure in its entirety can be pulled by name from an approved database and auto sequenced during the procedure. 4.1.3.  Simulated  Instrument  Flight.    Follow  AFI11-202V3  guidance.    A  qualified  safety observer must be in the aircraft or in a chase aircraft when conducting simulated instrument flight.  (T-1).    A  safety  observer  may  occupy  either  seat  of  the  F-16B/D  provided  the intercom  is  operable.    Use  the  radar  to  aid  in  clearing  the  area.    Pilots  in  F-16A/C  aircraft may not log simulated instrument flight without a chase.  They may fly multiple approaches in  VMC  without  a  chase,  but  pilots  should  place  their  primary  emphasis  on  seeing/sensing and  avoiding  other  aircraft.    Chase  aircraft  may  move  into  close  formation  on  final  for  a formation landing provided simulated instrument flight is terminated. 4.2.  Takeoff and Initial Join-up. 4.2.1.  If weather is  below 1,500 foot ceiling  and 3 miles (5 km), each aircraft and element will  climb  on  takeoff  heading  to  1,000  feet  AGL  before  initiating  any  turns,  except  when departure instructions specifically preclude compliance. (T-1). 4.3.  Trail Procedures. 4.3.1.  General.  During trail formations, basic instrument flying is the first priority and is not to  be  sacrificed  when  performing  secondary  trail  tasks.    Pilots  will  strictly  adhere  to  the briefed airspeeds, power settings, altitudes, headings and turn points. (T-1).  If task saturation occurs,  pilots  will  cease  attempts  to  maintain  radar  contact,  immediately  concentrate  on flying the instrument  procedure, and then notify the flight  lead.  (T-1).   The flight  lead will notify ATC. (T-1). 4.3.1.1.  Flight leaders will request non-standard formation from ATC. (T-1). 4.3.1.2.  ATC instructions issued to the lead aircraft apply to the entire flight. 4.3.1.3.  Normal spacing is 2-3 NM. AFI11-2F-16V3  13 JULY 2016 31 4.3.1.4.  Each  aircraft  and  element  will  follow  the  No  Radar/Sensor  Contact  procedures until  the  aircraft  or  element  immediately  in  trail  has  radar/sensor  contact  and  called "tied." (T-1). 4.3.2.  No Radar/Sensor Contact. 4.3.2.1.  The  flight  leader  will  call  initiating  all  turns.  (T-1).    Subsequent  aircraft  must delay turns to maintain the desired spacing. (T-1). 4.3.2.2.  Each aircraft and element will maintain 20 seconds or 2-3 NM spacing using all available aircraft systems and navigational aids to monitor position. (T-1). 4.3.2.3.  During climbs and descents, each aircraft or element will call passing each 5,000 foot altitude increment with altitude and heading (or heading passing) until join-up, level-off, or the following aircraft or element calls "tied." (T-1). 4.3.2.4.  Each aircraft and element will call initiating any altitude or heading change. (T-1). Acknowledgments  are not  required; however, it is  imperative that preceding aircraft or elements  monitor the radio  transmissions and progress  of the succeeding aircraft and elements, and immediately correct deviations from the planned route. 4.3.2.5.  Each  aircraft  and  element  will  maintain  at  least  1,000  feet  vertical  separation from the preceding aircraft or element until establishing radar or visual contact, except in instances  where  departure  instructions  specifically  preclude  compliance.  (T-1).    Reduce vertical separation to 500 feet if necessary to comply with MSA restrictions. 4.3.2.6.  In the event  a visual join-up cannot  be accomplished on top  or at level-off, the flight  leader  will  request  altitude  separation  for  each  succeeding  aircraft  or  element  to meet the requirements of the above paragraph. (T-1). 4.3.3.  Radar Contact. 4.3.3.1.  Each aircraft and element will call "tied" when radar contact is established with the  preceding  aircraft.  (T-1).  Once  all  aircraft  are  tied,  no  further  radio  calls  are necessary, except to acknowledge ATC instructions, unless radar contact is lost. 4.3.3.2.  In flights  of three or more aircraft, pilots will use  all available  aircraft systems (i.e., radar, TACAN, AAI, etc.) to  ensure  that trail is maintained on the correct aircraft. (T-1). 4.3.4.  Trail Departures. 4.3.4.1.  Pilots will use a minimum of 20 seconds takeoff spacing. (T-1). 4.3.4.2.  Each  aircraft/element  will  accelerate  in  MIL  or  AB  power  until  reaching  350 KIAS  (or  as  required  by  local  procedures).  (T-1).    Upon  reaching  this  speed,  the  flight leader  will  set  a  pre-briefed  power  setting.  (T-1).    Climb  at  350  KIAS  until  reaching cruise Mach/TAS, unless otherwise briefed. 4.3.4.3.  Pilots will make all turns using 30 degrees of bank. (T-1). 4.3.5.  Enroute  Trail.    Flight  leads  must  brief  airspeeds,  power  settings,  and  configurations. (T-1). 4.3.6.  Trail Recovery. 32 AFI11-2F-16V3  13 JULY 2016 4.3.6.1.  Trail  recoveries  are  only  authorized  at  locations  where  procedures  have  been established.  Appropriate ATC agencies must approve. (T-1).  OG/CCs must ensure trail recovery  procedures  are  included  in  local  procedures.  (T-3).    As  a  minimum,  OG/CCs must  ensure  procedures  address  each  recovery  profile,  missed  approach,  climb-out, desired and maximum spacing requirements, lost contact and lost communications. (T-1). 4.3.6.2.  OG/CCs must limit trail recovery to a maximum of four aircraft. (T-1). 4.3.6.3.  Trail recoveries are authorized when weather at the base of intended landing is at or  above  the  highest  pilot  weather  category  in  the  flight  or  approach  minimums, whichever is higher. 4.3.6.4.  The flight lead must brief the flight on spacing, configuration and airspeeds. (T-1). 4.3.6.5.  The  flight  lead  must  coordinate  the  trail  recovery  with  ATC  prior  to  taking spacing. (T-1). 4.3.6.6.  Prior to wingmen taking spacing for the trail recovery, the flight lead will ensure that all wingmen have operative navigational aids and radar. (T-1). 4.3.6.7.  Accomplish flight separation IAW local directives and in VMC if possible. 4.3.6.8.  The formation must squawk as directed by ATC. (T-1). 4.3.6.9.  ATC will provide radar flight following for the entire formation. (T-1). 4.3.6.10.  Pilots must limit all turns to a maximum of 30 degrees of bank. (T-1). 4.3.6.11.  Once  established  on  a  segment  of  a  published  approach,  each  aircraft  must comply with all published altitudes and restrictions while maintaining in-trail separation. (T-1). 4.3.6.12.  Unless  local  procedures  establish  defined  reference  points  for  airspeed  and configuration changes, the flight lead must direct changes by radio. (T-1).  At flight lead's call all aircraft must simultaneously comply with the directed change. (T-1). 4.3.6.13.  All aircraft must report the final approach fix. (T-1). 4.3.6.14.  If  contact  is  lost  with  the  preceding  aircraft,  the  pilot  will  transmit  "Callsign (C/S) lost contact." (T-1)  The preceding aircraft will respond with altitude, airspeed and heading. (T-1).  The aircraft will establish altitude deconfliction and coordinate a separate clearance  with  ATC.  (T-1).    If  contact  is  lost  while  established  on  a  segment  of  a published  approach,  flight  members  may  continue  the  approach,  but  must  confirm separation  via  navigation  aids.  (T-1).    If  separation  cannot  be  confirmed,  the  pilot  will execute missed approach or climb-out as instructed by ATC. (T-1). 4.3.6.15.  Flight  leads  will  coordinate  with  local  ATC  prior  to  penetration  if  the  trail recovery terminates in a Precision Approach Radar (PAR) or Airport Surveillance Radar (ASR) approach. (T-1). 4.4.  Formation  Break-up.  Pilots must execute formation break-up from a visual formation in VMC. (T-1).  If IMC is unavoidable, pilots must breakup from a visual formation in straight and level flight. (T-1).  This restriction does not apply to trail formation. Prior to an IMC break-up, the flight lead will confirm position and transmit attitude, altitude, airspeed, and altimeter setting. AFI11-2F-16V3  13 JULY 2016 33 (T-1).  Wingmen will acknowledge and confirm good navigational aids (reception of appropriate TACAN, ILS and/or appropriate GPS/INS waypoint). (T-1). 4.5.  Formation Penetration. 4.5.1.  Pilots  must restrict  formation  penetrations in  route or close  formation to  two aircraft when  the  weather  at  the  base  of  intended  landing  is  less  than  overhead  traffic  pattern minimums.  (T-1). 4.5.2.  If  a  formation  landing  is  intended,  the  wingman  should  be  positioned  on  the appropriate wing prior to weather penetration. 4.5.3.  Formation penetrations using radar trail procedures are authorized when weather at the base  of  intended  landing  is  at  or  above  the  highest  pilot  weather  category  in  the  flight  or approach minimums, whichever is higher. 4.6.  Formation  Approach.  During IMC formation flights, pilots will not change lead or wing positions  below  1,500  feet  AGL  unless  on  radar  downwind  or  if  required  during  a  formation approach with an F-16 experiencing an emergency. (T-1). 4.7.  Instrument Approach Procedures. 4.7.1.  Pilots  will  not  fly  any  published  instrument  procedure  (e.g.  DoD,  Jeppesen,  ICAO) that requires airspeeds less than those specified in T.O. 1F-16x-1. (T-1). 4.7.2.  The  F-16  is  Approach  Category  E.    If  no  Category  E  minimums  are  published, Category D minimums can be used, provided: 4.7.2.1.  A straight-in approach is flown. 4.7.2.2.  For the final approach segment, the aircraft is flown at 165 KIAS or less. 4.7.2.3.  For the missed approach segment, the aircraft is flown at 260 knots true airspeed (KTAS)  or  less.    At  high  density  altitudes  260  KTAS  may  require  a  KIAS  below  the speed specified in T.O. 1F-16x-1 and pilots shall not fly Category D approaches. (T-1). 34 AFI11-2F-16V3  13 JULY 2016 Chapter 5 AIR-TO-AIR WEAPONS EMPLOYMENT 5.1.  General.  Reference AFI 11-214 for procedures and restrictions. 5.2.  Simulated  Gun  Employment.  Aircrew  must  comply  with  the  below  restrictions  and procedures. (T-1). 5.2.1.  Never  perform  simulated  gun  employment  with  a  hot  gun  (one  that  is  not  safe  IAW T.O.  1F-16x-34-1-1).    Never  perform  a  trigger  check  with  a  hot  gun,  regardless  of  Master Arm switch position. 5.2.2.  Prior  to  flight,  confirm  the  status  of  the  gun  system.    Prior  to  simulated  gun employment,  perform  a  trigger  check  with  the  Master  Arm  switch  in  SIMULATE  and  the aircraft  pointed  away  from  other  aircraft  and  populated  areas.    If  HUD  symbology  reads “ARM” or SMS/MFD symbology reads “RDY,” do not squeeze the trigger or continue with simulated weapons employment. 5.3.  Maneuvering  Limitations.  Aircrew  must  comply  with  the  below  restrictions  and procedures. (T-1). 5.3.1.  Negative "G" guns jink maneuvers are prohibited. 5.3.2.  Minimum  airspeed  during  low  altitude  offensive  or  defensive  maneuvering  is  350 KIAS. 5.3.3.  All  configurations  are  authorized  for  unlimited  maneuvering  as  defined  by  AFI  11-214.  Before  conducting  unlimited  maneuvering  in  a  CAT  III  configured  aircraft,  consider gross weight, drag, departure susceptibility and training requirements. 5.3.4.  For D-model F-16s, restrict maximum-commanded or abrupt control inputs below 150 KIAS when flying ACBT sorties.  Full maneuvering may be resumed at or above 150 KIAS. AFI11-2F-16V3  13 JULY 2016 35 Chapter 6 AIR-TO-SURFACE WEAPONS EMPLOYMENT Section 6A—General 6.1.  General.  Reference AFI 11-214 for procedures and restrictions. 6.2.  Simulated  Gun  Employment.  Aircrew  must  comply  with  the  below  restrictions  and procedures. (T-1). 6.2.1.  Never  perform  a  trigger  check  with  a  hot  gun,  regardless  of  Master  Arm  switch position. 6.2.2.  Never perform simulated gun employment (squeezing the trigger with the Master Arm switch  in  SIM)  with  a  hot  gun  (one  that  is  not  safe  IAW  T.O.  1F-16x-34-1-1).    This restriction does not apply on a controlled range against targets approved for gun employment with ammunition loaded. 6.2.3.  Prior  to  flight,  confirm  the  status  of  the  gun  system.    Prior  to  simulated  gun employment,  perform  a  trigger  check  with  the  Master  Arm  switch  in  SIMULATE  and  the aircraft  pointed  away  from  other  aircraft  and  populated  areas.    If  HUD  symbology  reads “ARM” or SMS/MFD symbology reads “RDY,” do not squeeze the trigger or continue with simulated weapons employment. 6.3.  Training Missions with a Hot Gun. 6.3.1.  Pilots  will  not  select  strafe  submode  until  immediately  prior  to  roll  in  and  deselect strafe submode immediately after completing the safe escape maneuver. (T-1). 6.3.2.  When firing the laser, ensure you are not in a mode that allows the gun to fire. 6.3.3.  Pilots will not disable AGCAS for strafe operations. (T-3).  During LAS an automated recovery may occur near 2000 feet slant range; therefore pilots must cease fire prior to 2000 feet slant range or rounds may be employed well long of the target during automated pull-up. (T-1). 6.4.  Simulated Air-to-Surface Weapons Employment. 6.4.1.  A  simulated  attack  is  defined  as  an  attack  in  which  the  pilot  presses  the  weapons release (pickle) button and/or pulls the trigger with the intention of conducting a dry pass. 6.4.2.  Simulated Attacks against off-Range or Manned Targets.  Do not conduct such attacks with internally/externally loaded live ordnance (except for 20 mm ammunition in a gun safed IAW T.O. 1F-16x-34-1-1), externally loaded heavyweight inert ordnance, or hung ordnance.  When the aircraft is loaded with expendable stores (e.g., external fuel tanks, TERs carted at the  pylon),  load  simulated  weapons  (zero  quantity)  in  the  SMS/MFD  only  on  empty  or uncarted/unexpendable  stations  (Exception:  Captive  Maverick  and  HARM  missiles  may  be selected).  Confirm the Master Arm switch is in OFF or SIMULATE prior to the first attack.  Flight  lead  will  query  and  flight  members  will  reply  to  a  “check  zero  quantity,  uncarted station” radio call. (T-1). 36 AFI11-2F-16V3  13 JULY 2016 6.5.  Weather.  In  training,  pilots  will  not  conduct  climbing  or  diving  deliveries  with  a  ceiling below 2,000 feet AGL or level deliveries with a ceiling below 1,500 feet AGL. (T-1). 6.6.  Pop-Up  Attacks.  Pilots  will  abort  pop-up  attacks  if  airspeed  decreases  below  350  KIAS (300 KIAS above 10,000 feet AGL). (T-1). 6.7.  Target  Identification.  Pilots  shall  positively  identify  the  target  prior  to  weapons  release.  (T-1).    For  wartime  or  contingency  sorties,  pilots  must  comply  with  ROE.  (T-1).    For  training sorties,  pilots  must  achieve  positive  identification  by  either  visually  acquiring  the  target  or  by confirming target location through valid on-board/off-board cues. (T-1).  Cues may include, but are  not  limited  to,  radar,  GPS,  marking  rounds,  TGP  or  IR  Maverick  lock  on,  IR  pointers  or NVG-compatible  marking  devices.    Exercise  caution  when  relying  on  a  single  cue  to  confirm target location. 6.8.  Safety  of  Ground  Personnel.  When  ground  controllers  are  present  on  Class  B/C  ranges, range  personnel  will  brief  pilots  on  locations  of  these  personnel.  (T-1).    Each  pilot  will acknowledge.  (T-1).      Pilots  must  know  applicable  range  weapons  delivery  procedures, appropriate targets and weapons footprints. (T-1).  Pilots shall not expend ordnance if any doubt exists as to the ground personnel or intended target locations. (T-1). Section 6B—Night 6.9.  Altitude.  Compute an MSA for the entire bombing pattern using the guidance in AFI 11-214.  The minimum altitude for night High Angle Strafe (HAS) is the Target MSA (as defined in Attachment  1)  unless  executed  by  an  “NVG-LOWAT”  or  “NVG  High  Angle  Strafe  Low Altitude” qualified pilot (as defined in AFI 11-2F-16 V1) under high-illumination conditions (as defined in AFI 11-214). For HAS, pilots will review and confirm parameters prior to roll-in.  (T-1). 6.10.  Bank  Angle.  Pilots  will  not  exceed  135  degrees  of  bank  when  returning  to  the  low altitude structure (<5,000 feet AGL). (T-1). AFI11-2F-16V3  13 JULY 2016 37 Chapter 7 ABNORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES 7.1.  General.  Follow  the  procedures  in  this  chapter  when  other  than  normal  circumstances occur.  These procedures do not supersede procedures contained in the flight manual. Pilots will: 7.1.1.  Not  accept  an  aircraft  for  flight  with  a  malfunction  which  is  addressed  in  the emergency/abnormal  procedures  section  of  the  flight  manual  until  appropriate  corrective actions have been accomplished. (T-1). 7.1.2.  Not  fly  an  aircraft  with  a  tripped  engine  monitoring  system  (EMS)  Go-No-Go indicator  (Bit  Ball)  until  maintenance  has  accomplished  the  appropriate  procedures  and cleared the fault. (T-1). 7.1.3.  Not  taxi  with  a  known  malfunction  of  the  nose-wheel  steering  system,  the  brake system, or a generator [Note: F-16C/D aircraft may be taxied with a single generator failure (main or standby) if the other generator is operating normally]. (T-1). 7.1.4.  Once a malfunctioning aircraft system is isolated, do not use that system again unless its use in a degraded mode is essential for recovery. (T-1).  Pilots will not conduct ground or in-flight trouble-shooting after flight manual emergency procedures are complete. (T-1). 7.1.5.  In  the  F-16B/D,  the  pilot  in  command  is  primarily  responsible  for  handling  in-flight emergencies.  The additional pilot will confirm that all critical action procedures have been accomplished and provide checklist assistance at the request of the pilot in command. (T-1). 7.1.6.  For  actual/perceived  flight  control  malfunctions,  pilots  will  terminate  maneuvering and take appropriate action. (T-1).  If the problem was due to crew/passenger stick or rudder interference,  the  pilot  will  take  positive  action  to  ensure  no  further  control  interference occurs. (T-1). 7.1.7.  When  a  fuel  imbalance  exceeds  dash  one  limits,  terminate  tactical  maneuvering  and investigate. (T-1).  If the problem was caused by a slow feeding external or internal fuel tank and can be corrected, the mission may continue IAW TO 1F-16A/C-1.  If not, terminate the mission.    Instruments,  deployment  missions,  level  weapons  deliveries  and  straight-through-non-maneuvering  intercepts  are  authorized  to  reduce  gross  weight  until  a  safe  landing  is possible. 7.2.  Critical Action Procedures (CAPs).  CAPs are in Attachment 4. 7.3.  Ground Aborts. 7.3.1.  If a flight member aborts prior to takeoff, the flight lead normally renumbers the flight to maintain a numerical call sign sequence.  Flight leads will advise the appropriate agencies of such changes. (T-1). 7.3.2.  Pilots  who  do  not  takeoff  with  the  flight  may  join  the  flight  in  accordance  with  the brief or flight lead instructions.  If a join-up is to be accomplished on an air-to-ground range, the flight lead must terminate all events until the joining aircraft has achieved proper spacing. (T-1). 7.4.  Takeoff Aborts. 38 AFI11-2F-16V3  13 JULY 2016 7.4.1.  If  an  abort  occurs  during  takeoff  roll,  the  aborting  pilot  must  say  call  sign  and intentions when practical. (T-1).  Following aircraft will alter takeoff roll to ensure clearance or  abort  takeoff  if  adequate  clearance  cannot  be  maintained.  (T-1).    Pilots  must  use  the phrase "Cable, Cable, Cable" to indicate a departure-end cable arrestment. (T-1).  Pilots must use  the  phrase  "Barrier,  Barrier,  Barrier"  to  indicate  a  departure-end  net  arrestment.  (T-1).  OG/CCs must ensure local procedures address net barrier raising procedures. (T-1). 7.4.2.  When  aborting  above  120  KIAS,  or  whenever  hot  brakes  are  suspected,  pilots  will declare a ground emergency, taxi the aircraft to the designated hot brake area and follow hot brake procedures. (T-1). 7.4.3.  If aborting at or above 100 KIAS, pilots will lower the hook. (T-1).  If aborting below 100  KIAS,  pilots  will  lower  the  hook  if  there  is  any  doubt  about  the  ability  to  stop  on  the remaining runway. (T-1). 7.5.  Air Aborts. 7.5.1.  If an abort occurs after takeoff, all aircraft will maintain their original numerical call sign. (T-1). 7.5.2.  Escort aborting aircraft with an emergency condition to the field of intended landing.  When other than an emergency condition exists, the flight lead will determine if an escort for the aborting aircraft is necessary. (T-3). 7.5.3.  Pilots  will  abort  the  mission,  regardless  of  apparent  damage  or  subsequent  normal operation, for any of the following: (T-1). 7.5.3.1.  Bird strike 7.5.3.2.  Actual or suspected foreign object damage. 7.5.3.3.  Recovery below FRAG altitude with live ordnance. 7.5.3.4.  Moderate to severe icing. 7.5.3.5.  Over-G (Note: Land as soon as practical out of a straight-in approach). 7.5.3.6.  Flight  control  system  anomalies,  including  uncommanded  departures  from controlled  flight  (Exception:  intentional  departures  from  controlled  flight  conducted IAW a MAJCOM-approved syllabus), but not including flight control system lights that reset IAW flight manual procedures. 7.5.3.7.  Engine flameout/stagnation or shutdown. 7.5.3.8.  Lightning strike. 7.6.  Radio  Failure/No  Radio  (NORDO).  Reference  AFI  11-205  and  the  Flight  Information Handbook. 7.6.1.  NORDO in Formation. 7.6.1.1.  A pilot who experiences total radio failure while in close or route formation will maneuver within close/route parameters to attract the attention of another flight member and give the appropriate visual signals. (T-1).  The mission should be terminated as soon as practical and the NORDO aircraft led to the base of intended landing or a divert base.  AFI11-2F-16V3  13 JULY 2016 39 A  formation  approach  to  a  drop-off  on  final  should  be  performed  unless  safety considerations dictate otherwise. 7.6.1.2.  If flying other than close/route formation when radio failure occurs, the NORDO aircraft should attempt to rejoin to a route position at approximately 500 feet on another flight  member.    The  NORDO  aircraft  is  responsible  for  maintaining  clearances  from other  flight  members  until  his  presence  is  acknowledged  by  a  wingrock,  signifying clearance  to  join.    Once  joined,  the  NORDO  aircraft  will  give  the  appropriate  visual signals.  (T-1).    If  pre-briefed,  the  NORDO  aircraft  may  proceed  to  a  rendezvous  point and hold.  If no one has rejoined prior to reaching bingo fuel, the NORDO aircraft should proceed  to  the  base  of  intended  landing  or  a  divert  base.    Aircraft  experiencing  any difficulty/emergency in addition to NORDO will proceed as required by the situation. (T-1). 7.6.2.  NORDO on a Class A Range or a Manned Class B Range. 7.6.2.1.  Pilots  will  attempt  contact  with  the RCO on the appropriate back-up frequency or back up radio. (T-1). 7.6.2.2.  If  contact  cannot  be reestablished, pilots  will make a pass  by the range control tower on the attack heading while rocking wings and turn in the direction of traffic.  (T-1).  The flight lead will direct another flight member to escort the NORDO aircraft to a recovery base or rejoin the flight and RTB. (T-1). 7.6.2.3.  If the NORDO aircraft has an emergency, the NORDO aircraft will make a pass by the range control tower, if practical, on the attack heading while rocking wings, turn opposite the direction of  traffic, and proceed to  a recovery base.  (T-1).   The flight  lead will direct a flight member to join-up and escort the emergency aircraft. (T-1). 7.6.3.  NORDO on an Unmanned Class B Range or on a Class C Range. 7.6.3.1.  The NORDO aircraft will make a pass on the target maintaining normal pattern spacing, if possible, while rocking wings. (T-1).  The flight lead will direct another flight member to escort the NORDO aircraft to a recovery base or rejoin the flight in sequence and recover. (T-1).  If the NORDO aircraft has an emergency, if practical, it will make a pass  on  the  target  maintaining  normal  pattern  spacing,  rocking  wings,  turn  opposite direction  of  traffic  and  proceed  to  a  recovery  base.  (T-1).    The  flight  lead  will  direct  a flight member to join-up and escort the emergency aircraft. (T-1). 7.6.3.2.  Unexpended  Ordnance.    If  radio  failure  occurs  and  circumstances  preclude landing  with  unexpended  ordnance,  safe  jettison  of  ordnance  may  be  accomplished provided the following conditions are met: 7.6.3.3.  The NORDO aircraft joins on another flight member who has radio contact with the RCO and the remainder of the flight. 7.6.3.4.  Stores jettison visual signals specified in AFI 11-205 are relayed to the NORDO aircraft to initiate jettison. 7.6.4.  NORDO during Missile or Air-to-Air Gunnery Firing. 7.6.4.1.  Aircraft will not fire without two-way radio contact. (T-1). 40 AFI11-2F-16V3  13 JULY 2016 7.6.4.2.  If radio failure occurs, the pilot will safe the armament switches, join on another member of the flight or the tow aircraft, IAW paragraph  7.6.1. (T-1). 7.6.4.3.  Gunnery  target  tow  aircraft  experiencing  radio  failure  will  rock  wings  and continue the turn if an attack is in progress. (T-1).  The flight lead of the attacking aircraft will join on the tow's wing.  (T-1).  Remain clear of the banner in the event it is cut.  The tow pilot will use standard hand signals to indicate his difficulty. (T-1).  The flight lead will signal when the banner is cleared for cut with a slicing motion across the throat. (T-1).  After the banner is away and the flight lead determines there is no remaining cable, he  will  take  the  lead,  RTB  with  the  tow  aircraft  on  the  wing,  advise  the  tower  of  the NORDO  and  establish  the  appropriate  landing  pattern.  (T-1).    If  cable  remains,  follow local procedures. 7.6.5.  NORDO during Recovery. 7.6.5.1.  If a formation straight-in approach is flown and a go-around becomes necessary, the  chase  will  go-around,  pass  the  NORDO  aircraft  and  rock  his  wings.  (T-1).    The NORDO aircraft will go-around, if the situation allows. (T-1).  If the NORDO aircraft is in  formation  as  a  wingman,  the  leader  will  initiate  a  gentle  turn  into  the  wingman  and begin the go-around. (T-1). 7.6.5.2.  To  signal  the  need  for  an  approach-end  arrestment,  the  pilot  will  lower  the tailhook  (visual  formation)  or  fly  a  straight  in  approach  flashing  the  landing  light (unescorted). (T-1). 7.7.  Severe  Weather  Penetration.  Do not fly through severe weather.  If unavoidable, flights will split-up and obtain separate clearances prior to severe weather penetration. (T-1). 7.8.  Spatial Disorientation (SD).  SD has proven to be a leading killer of F-16 pilots.  Although SD  is  most  common  at  night  or  in  IMC,  it  can  and  has  happened  in  day  VMC.    Reference AFPAM11-417  for  information  on  the  causes  of  SD,  how  to  avoid  it,  and  how  to  mitigate  its consequences. 7.8.1.  Enabling PARS is an acceptable recovery method from SD induced unusual attitudes, reference AFTTP 3-3.F16 for recommended throttle techniques during PARS recoveries. 7.8.2.  Pilots should ensure deconfliction from other aircraft (primarily above or below their position) prior to PARS activation. 7.9.  Lost Wingman. 7.9.1.  Priorities.    The first  priority is  to  establish safe separation from  other aircraft (e.g., tanker  or  wingman).    Next,  obtain  a  separate  clearance  to  ensure  obstacle/terrain  clearance and clearance from other traffic. 7.9.2.  Prohibitions.    Do  not  practice  lost  wingman  procedures  in  other  than  day  VMC conditions. 7.9.3.  General  Procedures.  Simultaneously transition  to  instruments  and inform  lead while executing  lost  wingman  procedures  (ref  AFTTP  3-3.F16  for  amplifying  data).    Lead  will acknowledge the radio call and transmit attitude, heading, altitude and airspeed. (T-1).  Once lost wingman procedures have been executed, permission to rejoin must be obtained from the flight lead. (T-1). AFI11-2F-16V3  13 JULY 2016 41 7.9.4.  Two-  or  Three-Ship  Flights.    (Note:  If  in  three-ship  echelon,  refer  to  four-ship  lost wingman procedures.) 7.9.4.1.  Wings-Level  Flight  (climb,  descent  or  straight  and  level).    Simultaneously inform  the  leader  and  turn  away  using  15  degrees  of  bank  for  15  seconds,  then  resume heading and obtain a separate clearance. 7.9.4.2.  Outside the Turn.  Reverse the direction of turn using 15 degrees of bank for 15 seconds  and  inform  the  leader.    Continue  straight  ahead  to  ensure  separation  prior  to resuming the turn.  Obtain a separate clearance. 7.9.4.3.  Inside  the  Turn.    Momentarily  reduce  power  to  ensure  nose-tail  separation  and inform  the  flight  lead  to  roll  out  of  the  turn.    Maintain  angle  of  bank  to  ensure  lateral separation  and  obtain  a  separate  clearance.    The  leader  may  resume  turn  only  when separation is ensured. 7.9.4.4.  Precision/Non-precision  Final.    The  wingman  will  momentarily  turn  away  to ensure clearance, inform lead, and commence the published missed approach procedure while obtaining a separate clearance. (T-1). 7.9.4.5.  Missed  Approach.    The  wingman  will  momentarily  turn  away  to  ensure clearance,  inform  lead,  and  continue  the  published  or  assigned  missed  approach procedure  while  climbing  to  500  feet  above  missed  approach  altitude.  (T-1).    Obtain  a separate clearance. 7.9.5.  Four-Ship  Flights.    If  only  one  aircraft  in  the  flight  becomes  separated,  the  previous procedures  would  provide  safe  separation,  but  since  it  is  impossible  for  number  4  to immediately ascertain that number 3 still has visual contact with the leader, it is imperative that  number  4's  initial  action  be  based  on  the  assumption  that  number  3  has  also  become separated.    Numbers  2  and  3  will  follow  the  procedures  outlined  above.  (T-1).    Number  4 will follow the appropriate procedure listed below: (T-1). 7.9.5.1.  Wings-Level  Flight.   Simultaneously inform the leader and turn away using 30 degrees of bank for 30 seconds, then resume heading and obtain a separate clearance. 7.9.5.2.  Outside  the  Turn.    Reverse  direction  of  turn  using  30  degrees  of  bank  for  30 seconds to ensure separation from lead and number 3 and obtain a separate clearance. 7.9.5.3.  Inside  the  Turn.    Momentarily  reduce  power  to  ensure  nose-tail  separation  and increase  bank  angle  by  15  degrees.    Inform  the  leader  to  roll  out.    Obtain  a  separate clearance.  Leader will resume turn only when separation is ensured. (T-1). 7.10.  Armament System Malfunctions. 7.10.1.  General.  Do not attempt to expend ordnance using a weapons release system with a known  malfunction.    If  abnormal  missile  launch  or  erratic  missile  flight  occurs,  have  the launching aircraft visually inspected by a chase pilot, if possible, to determine if any damage has occurred. 7.10.2.  Inadvertent Release.  Record switch positions at the time of inadvertent release and impact  point,  if  known,  and  provide  the  information  to  debrief  personnel.    Check  switches safe  and  do  not  attempt  further  release  in  any  mode.    Treat  remaining  stores  as  hung  and 42 AFI11-2F-16V3  13 JULY 2016 obtain a chase aircraft for RTB, if practical.   If remaining stores present  a recovery hazard, jettison in a suitable area on a single pass, if practical. 7.10.3.  Hung  Freefall  Ordnance  or  Missile  Hangfire/Misfire.    First  confirm  switches/SMS settings were correct.    If they were, record  all relevant  switch/SMS settings and proceed  as follows. 7.10.3.1.  Hung  Live  Freefall  Ordnance.    Attempt  delivery  using  an  alternate  delivery mode,  if  applicable.    If  unsuccessful,  use  selective  jettison  procedures  for  the  store.    If unsuccessful and the ordnance is either unsecure or the security of the ordnance cannot be determined, consider selective jettison of the rack. 7.10.3.2.  Hung Practice/Inert Freefall Ordnance.  Make an additional attempt to expend.  If  unsuccessful,  select  an  alternate  delivery  mode  and  try  again.    If  unsuccessful, ordnance  from  other  stations/dispensers  may  be  released  provided  this  does  not  violate load symmetry limits.  If remaining stores present a recovery hazard, jettison in a suitable area on a single pass, if practical. 7.10.3.3.  Maverick Missile Hangfire.  A missile that fires but fails to depart the aircraft is a hangfire.  If able, have a chase pilot inspect such a missile. 7.10.3.4.  Maverick  Missile  Misfire.    A  missile  that  fails  to  fire  when  all  appropriate switches were selected is a misfire.  If this occurs, safe the Master Arm switch.  If able, have  a  chase  pilot  inspect  the  missile  for  smoke  or  fire.    If  either  exists,  jettison  the missile on the range.  If not, pilots may attempt another pass.  If the second attempt fails and  conditions  permit,  remain  dry  in  the  pattern  for  15  minutes,  then  proceed  to  the recovery base following hung ordnance/weapons malfunction recovery procedures. 7.10.3.5.  Hung Ordnance/Weapons Malfunction Recovery Procedures.  Visually inspect the  aircraft  for  damage,  if  practical.    Declare  an  emergency  (not  required  for  hung practice/inert  ordnance  or  hung  rockets).    Obtain  a  chase  aircraft,  if  available.    Avoid populated areas and trail formations.  Land from a straight-in approach. 7.11.  In-flight  Practice  of  Emergency  Procedures.  Reference  AFI  11-202V3.    A  simulated emergency  procedure  is  any  procedure  that  produces  an  effect  closely  paralleling  the  actual emergency.  One example would be retarding the throttle sufficiently to emulate the performance of an aircraft with a flamed out or idle engine. 7.11.1.  Prohibitions.  Do not practice aborted takeoffs in the aircraft.  Instead, use the flight simulator, Cockpit Familiarization Trainer or a static aircraft, in that order of preference.  Do not practice in-flight engine shutdown.  Do not practice SFO patterns unless crash rescue is available  and  either  an  active  tower  or  a  ROM  (or  equivalent,  e.g.  SOF)  is  in  operation.  Pilots will not practice SFO patterns in conditions other than day VMC. (T-1). 7.11.2.  Simulated  Flameout  (SFO)/Emergency  Landing  Patterns.  OG/CCs  will  establish specific  procedures  for  SFO  training  and  establish  letters  of  agreement  with  appropriate agencies. (T-1). They will publish those procedures in their supplement to this volume.  (T-1).  General SFO procedures follow: 7.11.2.1.  The SFO pattern may be entered from any direction or altitude that ensures the aircraft is properly configured above 2,000 feet AGL and in a position to safely complete the approach. AFI11-2F-16V3  13 JULY 2016 43 7.11.2.2.  Do  not  initiate  or  continue  an  SFO  if  a  potential  traffic  pattern  conflict  exists that would require division of the pilot’s attention between the SFO and sequencing with traffic.  Discontinue an SFO whenever excessive maneuvering is required, whether as a result of a traffic conflict or when making corrections.  Discontinue an SFO if unable to obtain  wings  level  on  final  by  200  feet  AGL.    Discontinue  an  SFO  if  airspeed  drops below Dash One minimum airspeed any time between base key and the initiation of the flare.  Once the decision to discontinue an SFO has been made, initiate a go-around and do not attempt to resume the SFO. 7.11.2.3.  Except when operating IAW a MAJCOM-approved syllabus (e.g., AFMC high angle of attack training), do not touch down from an SFO. 7.11.2.4.  Make radio calls IAW local procedures, but as a minimum call. 7.11.2.4.1.  "High Key" 7.11.2.4.2.  "Low Key" 7.11.2.4.3.  "Base Key, Gear Down, (Intentions)" 7.12.  Search  and  Rescue  (SAR)  Procedures.  General  directive  procedures  are  listed  below.  OG/CCs will establish specific procedures in the unit supplement to this volume.  (T-1). 7.12.1.  Squawk.    Immediately  cease  tactical  maneuvering  by  executing  Knock-It-Off procedures.  Place IFF to EMER to alert ATC/GCI/AWACS of the emergency situation. 7.12.2.  Talk.    Establish  an  On  Scene  Commander  (OSC).    Communicate  the  emergency situation and intentions immediately to applicable control agencies.  Use GUARD frequency if necessary. 7.12.3.  Mark.    Mark  the  last  known  position  of  survivors/crash  site  using  any  means available, e.g. visual ground references, TACAN, INS, EGI, ATC/GCI/AWACS, HMCS, or TGP.  Pass this information to follow-on SAR forces. 7.12.4.  Separate.  Remain above the last observed parachute altitudes until the position of all possible  survivors  is  determined.    If  visual  contact  with  parachute  is  not  maintained,  allow approximately  1  minute  per  thousand  feet  (16  feet  per  second)  for  parachute  descent.    The OSC will establish deconfliction between all aircraft involved in the SAR. (T-1). 7.12.5.  Update  Bingo/Recovery  Base.    Revise  bingo  fuels  or  recovery  bases  as  required  to maintain  maximum  SAR  coverage  over  survivor(s).    Pilots  will  not  overfly  bingo.  (T-1).  Relinquish  OSC  duties  to  more  qualified  rescue  forces  (e.g.,  SANDY  1,  US  Coast  Guard) upon their arrival. 7.12.6.  For  overwater  SAR/CSAR,  OSC  will  utilize  every  means  available  (visual,  TGP, Radar  Ground  Map,  or  Ground  Moving  Target  Modes)  to  locate  vessels  that  may  aid  in recovery. (T-1). 7.13.  Post  Arresting  Gear  Engagement  Procedures.  Do  not  shut  down  the  engine  unless fire/other conditions dictate or directed to do so by the arresting gear crew.  Raise the tailhook on the signal from the arresting crew.  Pilots will not taxi until directed to do so by the arresting gear crew. (T-1). 44 AFI11-2F-16V3  13 JULY 2016 Chapter 8 LOCAL OPERATING PROCEDURES 8.1.  General.  This  chapter  provides  a  consolidated  framework  for  wings  to  supplement  (IAW AFI 33-360) local operating procedures.

ANG and AFRC only: as designated by the OG/CC.  AFI11-2F-16V3  13 JULY 2016 51 Attachment 2 CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, NUCLEAR, AND HIGH YIELD EXPLOSIVE (CBRNE) OPERATIONS A2.1.  General  Information.  Potential  adversary  use  of  CBRNE  weapons  against  a  friendly airfield  presents  a  serious  threat  to  flying  operations.    Although  the  most  effective  way  for aircrews to avoid this threat is to be airborne before those weapons are detonated/dispersed and then  land  at  a  field  that  has  not  been  contaminated,  all  personnel  must  be  prepared  to  operate from a field that has come under CBRNE attack. A2.2.  Mission Preparation.  Be aware of the status of the CBRNE environment at the planned launch and recovery airfields, potential divert bases, and throughout the area in which the sortie may fly.  Know the current and forecast surface wind direction and the MOPP level in effect for relevant sectors of the airfield.  Don appropriate aircrew chemical defense equipment (ACDE) or Ground  Crew  Ensemble  (GCE)  to  match  the  appropriate  MOPP  level  (reference  AFMAN  10-100) and carry individual protective equipment (IPE) as required. A2.3.  Stepping to Fly and Aircraft Preflight.  This may entail donning ACDE or transitioning from  GCE  to  ACDE.    Take  precautions  to  protect  aircrew  from  injury  and  or  contamination while  in  transit  from  the  squadron  facility  to  the  aircraft.    If  possible,  transport  aircrew  in  a vehicle that provides overhead cover (enclosed vehicle).  If aircrew travel on foot is unavoidable, choose  a  route  that  takes  maximum  advantage  of  available  overhead  cover  (sun  shades, buildings, etc.) to avoid  agents that may be settling from the air.  If extra aircrew members are available for preflight duties, consider assigning them to do so wearing GCE.  This will allow the aircrew actually flying to minimize exposure. A2.3.1.  Alarm  Red  (or  Theater  Equivalent)  Prior  to  Engine  Start.    If  Alarm  Red  occurs during the step or preflight process, take cover and don appropriate MOPP.  This may require use  of  the  ground  crew  mask.    A  hardened  aircraft  shelter  (HAS)  provides  optimum protection,  if  available.    Use  caution  if  entering  a  HAS  that  contains  aircraft  and/or equipment.  Close  doors  after  entry.    If  a  HAS  or  other  overhead  cover  is  not  immediately available, accept the best rapidly reachable cover. A2.4.  Engine  Start  to  Takeoff  .    If  a  HAS  is  available,  use  it  to  minimize  exposure  time  by accomplishing  aircraft  arming  and  End  of  Runway  (EOR)  procedures  inside  it  (if  local procedures permit) and by delaying taxi time as long as possible prior to takeoff. A2.4.1.  Aircraft  Launch  to  Survive  (LTS).    Units  will  develop  local  procedures  to  provide this option to the commander.  In general, aircraft may LTS any time after engine start if they have  sufficient  fuel  and  safe,  expeditious  access  to  a  runway.    This  option  may  only  be practical for aircraft that are near EOR prior to takeoff or that have just landed. A2.4.2.  Alarm  Red  Prior  to  Taxi.    If  in  a  HAS,  the  normal  procedure  is  to  shut  down.  Engine  noise  may  preclude  effectiveness  of  normal  alert  notification  procedures,  so  ensure ground  personnel  are  aware  of  the  alarm  warning,  assume  proper  MOPP,  and  close  HAS doors.  Use hand signals if necessary. A2.4.3.  Alarm Red (or Theater Equivalent) After Taxi.  Units typically establish procedures for  this  contingency  depending  on  whether  additional  protection  is  available  along  the  taxi route (empty HAS, for instance).   Ideally,  ground crew sheltering in  such a HAS would be 52 AFI11-2F-16V3  13 JULY 2016 available  to  assist  in  normal  engine  shutdown  procedures  and  to  close  HAS  doors.    If protection  is  not  available,  the  best  option  may  be  LTS.    Maintain  contact  with  Command and  Control  (C2)  entities  (Wing  Operations  Center,  Maintenance  Operations  Center, Supervisor of Flying, etc.) to ensure unity of effort in the overall plan. A2.5.  Takeoff to Landing. A2.5.1.  Contamination.    If  Chemical  Warfare  (CW)  agent  contamination  occurred  prior  to takeoff,  flying  the  aircraft  will  dissipate  the  agent  to  some  degree.    The  total  amount  of dissipation  will  be  greater  with  lower  flight  altitudes  and  longer  flight  times.    Because  the agent  may have  entered  wheel  wells, flaps,  etc.,  consider flying in  landing  configuration to increase airflow to these areas.  In any circumstances, merely flying the aircraft is unlikely to achieve complete decontamination. A2.5.2.  Preparing  to  Land.    Aircrew  should  remain  aware  of  the  status  of  primary  and alternate landing locations.  Do not attempt to land during Alarm Red situations unless there is no other option.  Follow C2 directions and either hold or divert.  If mission needs preclude divert,  hold  until  the  Alarm  Red  (or  theater  equivalent)  has  cleared  or  become  an  Alarm Black.    Prior  to  landing,  gain  awareness  of  contaminated  sectors  of  the  airfield  and  of current/forecast surface winds.  Use this information in conjunction with C2 direction to plan a  route  from  landing  to  engine  shutdown.    The  liquid  deposition  phase  following  a  CW airburst  attack  can  extend  up  to  1  hour.    If  landing  during  Alarm  Black,  expect  a contaminated environment and MOPP 4. A2.6.  Landing to Engine Shutdown.  Take advantage of any protection available, minimizing taxi  time  and  distance.    Maintain  contact  with  C2  in  order  to  remain  aware  of  unexploded ordnance  and/or  damage  to  airfield  movement  surfaces.    If  a  HAS  is  available  and  local procedures  permit,  accomplish  aircraft  de-arm  and  EOR  procedures  there.    If  Alarm  Red  (or Theater Equivalent) occurs between landing and engine shutdown, considerations are similar to those discussed in the engine-start-to-takeoff section. A2.7.  After Engine Shutdown  .  Don appropriate MOPP if not already worn.  If circumstances permit, accomplish normal post-flight inspection procedures.  If the aircraft is not contaminated, close  the  canopy.    If  there  is  any  suspicion  of  personnel  contamination,  aircrew  will  process through  an  aircrew  contamination  control  area  (ACCA).    Accomplish  maintenance  debriefings under cover to the maximum extent possible.  AFI11-2F-16V3  13 JULY 2016 53 Attachment 3 FLIGHT BRIEFING GUIDES Table A3.1.  General Briefing Guide.
