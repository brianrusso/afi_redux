Aircrew members who have a primary job performing wing supervision or staff functions that directly support flying operations. AFI11-2HC-130JV1  1 SEPTEMBER 2017 11 1.8.1.1.3.  Aircrew  members  assigned  to  the  Formal  Training  Unit  (FTU),  United States Air Force Weapons School (USAFWS), and Operational / Developmental Test and Evaluation units. 1.8.1.2.  BMC  crewmembers  shall  be  able  to  attain  proficiency  and  if  required certification/qualification  in  30  days  or  less  for  those  missions/events  in  which  they maintain familiarization only. (T-2). 1.8.1.3.  BMC aircrew will maintain all flight and ground currencies and accomplish all RAP  designated  training  which  affects  BMC  status.  (T-2).      Failure  to  accomplish  this training results in regression to Non-BMC status (N-BMC). 1.8.1.4.  BMC  aircrew  members  may  deploy  and  participate  in  missions  that  they  are proficient and qualified in without additional training, as determined by the SQ/CC. 1.8.2.  Combat  Mission  Ready  (CMR).  A  status  that  denotes  a  crewmember  is  receiving the training required to be certified, current and proficient in the DOC mission requirements of their assigned flying unit. 1.8.2.1.  The following aircrew are designated as CMR: 1.8.2.1.1.  Combat  unit  RegAFAPI-1/2/A  positions,  flying  squadron  commander (SQ/CC)  and  squadron  operations  officers  (SQ/DO).    If  a  unit  is  over-manned,  the SQ/CC will train the front line of their Unit Manpower Document (UMD) API-1/2/A positions to CMR and may elect to designate the overage as BMC.  (T-2). 1.8.2.1.2.  API-6/B  positions  not  assigned  to  the  flying  squadron  may  be  designated as  CMR  by  operations  group  commanders  (OG/CCs).  ANG/AFRC:    Any  aircrew member may be designated CMR/BMC at OG/CC discretion. 1.8.2.2.  CMR  aircrew  members  are  expected  to  maintain  flight  and  ground  currencies and accomplish all RAP designated training that affects CMR status.  Failure to complete training  or  maintain  currencies  will  result  in  regression  to  Non-CMR  (N-CMR)  status.  (T-2). 1.9.  RAP  Policy  and  Management.  RAP  is  executed  IAW  this  instruction  and  the  current MAJCOM  RTM.    The  RTM  takes  precedence  over  this  instruction  and  may  contain  updated mission and event requirements not yet incorporated in this instruction. 1.9.1.  RAP Training Cycle.  The training cycle is defined by the RTM. 1.9.2.  RAP  Tasking  Memorandum.  The  RTM  and  this  instruction  identify  BMC  and CMR training requirements by establishing a minimum number of sorties, events and special capabilities  that  are  completed  based  on  aircrew  experience  levels.    Specific  sorties  and events  listed  in  the  RTM  may  not  be  identified  in  this  volume  and  RTM  will  provide necessary guidance in these instances. 1.9.2.1.  Sorties and events  defined by the RTM are minimums  and will not  be reduced except  by  proration,  waiver  or  situations  as  stipulated  by  this  instruction  and  the  RTM.  (T-2). 1.9.2.2.  Each  RAP  sortie  will  accomplish  a  tactical  mission  scenario  or  a  basic  skills mission that supports the unit’s mission to receive credit as an effective RAP sortie.  (T-3). 12 AFI11-2HC-130JV1  1 SEPTEMBER 2017 1.9.2.3.  Units  will  follow  guidelines  for  RAP  sorties  and  events  with  minor  variances authorized. (T-2).  SQ/CCs may use variations in sortie types as a basis for end-of cycle regression. in 1.9.3.  RAP Training Development.  Units will design a training program to achieve combat capability tasked  missions,  maintain  aircrew  proficiency  and  enhance  mission accomplishment  and  safety.  (T-2).    RAP  training  sorties  should  emphasize  either  over-arching  combat  skills  or  scenarios  that  reflect  procedures  and  operations  based  on employment  plans,  location,  current  intelligence,  and  opposition  capabilities.    Use  of procedures  and  actions  applicable  to  combat  scenarios  are  desired  (e.g.,  appropriate  use  of code  words,  authentication  procedures,  combat  tactics,  safe  recovery  procedures,  tactical deception,  in-flight  reports,  threat  reactions,  and  intelligence  briefing/debriefing).    Tactical training  should  include  use  of  threat  simulators,  countermeasures  and  include  participation with other rescue weapon systems/support aircraft to the maximum extent possible. 1.9.4.  RAP  Training  Reports.  Submit  RAP  training  reports  IAW  MAJCOM  RTM guidance. (T-2). 1.10.  Aircrew Experience.  Aircrew members require a minimum number of flight hours to be considered  experienced  (EXP)  in  the  aircraft  IAW  AFI  11-412,  Aircrew  Management.    Table 1.1. defines the minimum hours required for aircrew to be considered experienced. (T-2).  MPD pilots  are  considered  inexperienced  for  any  required  reporting  or  tracking  purposes.    Unit Commanders may increase hour requirements prior to designating a member experienced based on individual performance levels or other factors. Table 1.1.  Experienced Aircrew Requirements.

The SQ/CC's first priority is to train all designated aircrew to CMR. Priorities for sortie allocations are as follows: CMR API-1/2/A, CMR API-6/B,  BMC,  API-5  Flight  Surgeons,  and  then  all  others.  Inexperienced  API-1/2/A  aircrew members should receive sortie allocation priority over experienced aircrew members. 1.12.2.  Formal  Training  Units  and  USAFWS  (TF  coded  units).    The  execution  of  formal syllabus  training  within  MAJCOM-programmed  flying  training  timelines  should  be  the SQ/CCs priority.  Priorities for sortie allocations are as follows:  Syllabus training, instructor upgrade  training,  instructor  continuation  training,  and  staff  personnel  not  performing Instructor or Flight Examiner (FE) duties (to include API-5 Flight Surgeons). 1.12.3.  Test  and  Test  Evaluation  Squadron  (TES)  Units  (CB  coded  units).    Requirements directed  by  MAJCOM,  training  required  to  prepare  for  assigned  projects/tasking,  BMC training  requirements  that  cannot  be  accomplished  on  primary  missions,  API  5  Flight Surgeons. 1.12.4.  API-6/8/B/D  flyers.    Units  should  provide  attached  API  6/8/B/D  flyers  adequate resources to maintain minimum training requirements.  However, API-6/8/B/D flyer support will not come at the expense of the flying squadron's primary mission. (T-2).  If units cannot meet attached flyer requirements, they may request relief IAW AFI 11-401, as supplemented.  Units  requiring  flying  hour  adjustments  for  attached  API-6/8/B/D  flyers  may  request program changes IAW AFI 11-102, Flying Hour Program Management. 1.12.4.1.  For  FTU  only  wings,  API-6/B  crewmembers  maintain  instructor  status (optional  for  WG/GP  CC,  FCF  crewmembers).    These  wings  fly  API-1/6/A/B crewmembers as required by Program Flying Training (PFT). 1.12.4.2.  API-8/D (above wing level) rated personnel flying authorizations and Test Unit crewmembers are IAW AFI 11-401 and MAJCOM guidance.  They should fly the BMC rate; however, they are not required to complete BMC specific missions/events, or meet monthly RAP lookback requirements. 1.13.  Formal Training Conducted in Unit (Secondary Method Training).  When attendance at  a  formal  school  course  is  not  practical  or  no  quotas  exist,  units  may  request  approval  to conduct training in-unit using formal school syllabus and courseware.  EXCEPTION: Instructor Upgrades & Requalifications conducted in home station WSTs by contracted flight instructors do not  require  SMT  approval;  however,  un-programmed  training  still  requires  overage  approval from ACC/A3J.  Any aircrew member who has previously failed to complete a formal course for substandard performance will not complete SMT for the same course.  (T-2). 1.13.1.  SMT  Approval  Authority.  Submit  approval  requests  through  local  channels  to MAJCOM/A3T  Flight  Operations  Division  (ANG  and  AFRC  units),  HQ  ACC/A3J Personnel  Recovery  Division  (ACC units) or HQ AETC/A3Z (AETC units) for review  and approval. Reference  Attachment 5 for approval format. 1.13.1.1.  Sequence of training  waivers for  ground, simulator, and  flying  events  may  be approved  on  a  case-by-case  basis  by  the  unit  operations  officer.    MAJCOM/A3T  or ACC/A3J approve all other modifications to formal school products. 14 AFI11-2HC-130JV1  1 SEPTEMBER 2017 1.13.1.2.  Units maintain a copy of SMT approvals in the individual's training records. 1.13.2.  Formal  School  Courseware Requests.   For secondary method training, the  approval authority includes the appropriate  formal school  as an  addressee on all  correspondence  and requests that the formal school forward applicable courseware to the aircrew member’s unit of assignment.  Courseware includes but is not limited to; the course syllabus of instruction (SOI), briefings, computer based training (CBT) modules, instructor guides, training guides and  student  grade  sheets.    This  information  may  be  web-based  or  available  through  other digital  mediums.    The  unit  training  office  will  verify  currency  of  the  courseware  obtained.  (T-2). 1.13.2.1.  Formal  school  courseware will only be  used to  train  the individual referenced in the approved SMT approval.  (T-2). 1.13.2.2.  If  the  course  includes  an  end  of  course  exam,  units  may  substitute  a  locally developed exam with a minimum passing score of 85 percent. 1.13.3.  When a formal school course is authorized to be conducted in unit, the unit assumes responsibility for providing this training locally.  The following applies to SMT: 1.13.3.1.  Secondary  method  training  will  be  completed  within  120  days  from  the  first flight or WST sortie for Instructor Upgrades and Requalification’s. (T-2). SMT approvals for  Initial  Qualification  or  Initial  Mission  Qualification  will  only  be  granted  in extraordinary  circumstances;  the  approving  MAJCOM  determines  time  limits  as  part  of the  approval.    Failure  to  complete  within  the  specified  time  limit  requires  notification through channels to MAJCOM/A3T Flight Operations Division (ANG and AFRC units), HQ  ACC/A3J  Personnel  Recovery  Division  (ACC  units)  or  HQ  AETC/A3Z  (AETC units)  with  individual’s  name,  rank,  reason  for  delay,  planned  actions  and  estimated completion date. 1.13.3.2.  Ground training event prerequisites will be IAW the formal course SOI.  (T-2). 1.13.3.3.  Simulator  training  mission  event  prerequisites  will  be  IAW  the  formal  course SOI.  (T-2).

General.  This chapter outlines the minimum requirements for Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ)  training  which  includes  initial  qualification,  requalification,  conversion  or  difference training, and senior officer courses. 2.2.  Initial Qualification Training (IQT).  IQT provides aircrew the basic training necessary to initially  qualify  in  flying  duties  without  regard  to  a  specific  unit's  mission.    Upon  completion, aircrew members attain BAQ status.  BAQ is a prerequisite for all follow-on training, including MQT. 2.2.1.  The primary method of IQT is to attend the appropriate formal training course listed in the  Education  and  Training  Course  Announcements  (ETCA).    When  attendance  is  not practical  or  no  quotas  exist,  units  will  request  a  waiver  to  conduct  in-unit  SMT  IAW paragraph 1.13.  (T-2). 2.2.2.  Training  Prerequisites.

This  chapter  outlines training requirements for mission qualification training  (MQT) and mission certification (assignment of BMC or CMR). the  minimum  requirements  criteria  and 3.2.  Mission Qualification Training.  MQT provides aircrew the training necessary to initially qualify  or  re-qualify  in  flying  duties  to  perform  the  unit’s  mission.    Upon  completion,  aircrew members maintain BAQ status until the SQ/CC certifies the member as BMC or CMR. 3.2.1.  The primary method of MQT is to attend the appropriate formal training course listed in  the  ETCA.    When  attendance  is  not  practical  or  no  quotas  exist,  units  will  request authorization to conduct in-unit SMT IAW  paragraph 1.13.  (T-2).   3.2.2.  Training  Prerequisites.    Complete  training  prerequisites  IAW  AFI  11-202V1  and  the current Bookstore (https://trss3.randolph.af.mil/bookstore/home/homePage.aspx)  is  the  primary  source  for all formal syllabi. AETC The SOI.  3.2.2.1.  All pilots graduate MQT as Mission Pilots (MP).  If a pilot is unable to maintain MP status, SQ/CCs can downgrade individuals to First Pilot (FP) status until the member is ready to requalify as an MP IAW Chapter 4.  MPs will not fly as a pilot-in-command until certified by the SQ/CC as an aircraft commander IAW Chapter 5.  (T-1). 3.2.2.2.  Previously  qualified  pilots  (PQP)  are  those  pilots  cross-flowing  from  another MDS to include FAIPs and Operational Support Aircraft (OSA).  PQPs are not required to  enter  the  Mission  Pilot  Development  (MPD)  program,  however  SQ/CCs  can  elect  to place a PQP in the MPD program based on the individual’s previous experience.  PQPs will not act as pilot-in-command until meeting prerequisites IAW Table 5.1 and certified by the SQ/CC IAW Chapter 5.  (T-1). 3.2.2.3.  Mission  Pilots  entering  a  unit  for  their  first  operational  assignment  (pipeline) will be entered into the MPD program at Stage 1.  (T-2). 3.2.3.  Flying  Training  Requirements.    Complete  flying  training  requirements  IAW  the formal course SOI and the following: 3.2.3.1.  High  winds  or  non-availability  of  parachutists  may  cause  loadmasters  to complete  MQT  without  conducting  actual  personnel  airdrops.    In  these  cases,  use standard  airdrop  training  bundles  (SATB)  during  flight  training.    If  actual  personnel airdrops  were  not  accomplished  during  formal  training,  the  FTU  issues  a  restricted  AF Form  8,  Certificate  of  Aircrew  Qualification,  IAW  AFI  11-2HC-130JV2.    Accomplish final  certification  of  personnel  airdrop  in-unit  under  the  supervision  of  an  instructor  or flight  examiner loadmaster on an  actual static line personnel  airdrop.   Loadmasters will not be certified CMR until final certification for personnel airdrops is complete. (T-2). 3.2.3.2.  Units  North  of  the  60˚  Parallel.    When  MQT  is  conducted  via  in-unit  SMT, crewmembers in units North of the 60˚ N parallel scheduled to complete MQT during the summer  months  (May  through  August),  have  until  31  October  to  complete  the  required 20 AFI11-2HC-130JV1  1 SEPTEMBER 2017 night/NVG training events.  The mission qualification evaluation for these crewmembers may be administered before completing night training events. 3.3.  Mission  Certification.  Mission  qualification  is  a  prerequisite  for  mission  certification  or recertification,  as  required.    The  SQ/CC  will  certify  crewmembers  as  BMC  or  CMR  upon completion of training requirements.  Commanders should normally certify individuals to BMC or CMR within 120 days of member arriving at the unit after completing mission qualification.  (T-2). 3.3.1.  Basic  Mission  Capable  Certification.    Certification  as  BMC  requires  the  following:  (T-2). 3.3.1.1.  Completion  of  all  BMC-related  ground  training  IAW  the  RTM.

This  chapter  combined  with  the  MAJCOM  RAP  Tasking  Memorandum  defines minimum ground and flying training requirements for BAQ, BMC and CMR crewmembers.  CT provides  aircrew  the  training  necessary  to  maintain  flying  safety  &  proficiency  and  consists  of two aspects.  The first involves training in the basic skills necessary to ensure the safe operation of the aircraft and safe execution of mission events, these requirements are listed in  Table 4.1,  4.2,  4.3.  The second (RAP) consists of specific mission sorties, events, and training required to be proficient in the unit's assigned missions, these requirements are listed in the RTM as volume only requirements.  Table 4.1,  4.2,  4.3 and the RTM must be referenced to determine BMC & CMR requirements. 4.2.  Ground  Training.  Ground  training  will  be  accomplished  IAW  the  RTM,  this  AFI,  and ancillary  training  requirements  IAW  AFI  36-2201.    (T-2).    The  RTM  establishes  event frequency, identifies grounding events, and reflects if mission status is affected. 4.2.1.  Ground training event descriptions/guidance derived from this instruction are listed in  Attachment 2 of this AFI.  For other ground training descriptions, see the reference directive listed in the RTM. 4.2.2.  Ground training tables in this instruction do not include ancillary training required by AFI  36-2201,  Training  Development,  Delivery,  and  Evaluation.    This  includes  Total  Force Awareness  Training  and  Expeditionary  Skills  Training  which  will  be  tracked  at  unit  level. (T-2). 4.2.3.  Failure  to  complete  ground  training  events  may  affect  BMC/CMR  status.    See  paragraph 4.7.3.1. 4.3.  Flying  Training.  Aircrew will accomplish flying training requirements applicable to their individual crew position IAW Table 4.1,   4.2,   4.3 and as specified by the RTM.  (T-2). Table 4.1,  4.2,  4.3 apply to RegAF, AFRC, & ANG units.  BAQ-only aircrew will maintain currency in applicable events noted as BAQ in flying training tables. (T-2).  Failure to accomplish flying requirements may affect BMC/CMR status and require additional training. 4.3.1.  Crewmembers  assigned/attached to  Training or Test  coded units  will accomplish  the BMC  requirements  as  shown  in  the  RTM  for  those  events  that  they  are  qualified/certified.  Failure to accomplish requirements will not affect instructor status, but will require training as  determined  by  the  SQ/CC.    Additionally,  the  SQ/CC  will  determine  which  requirements listed in Table 4.1,  4.2,  4.3 will be maintained by assigned/attached aircrew members.  (T-2). 4.3.2.  Aircrew will not log events for which they are unqualified or not certified. (T-2). 4.3.3.  Flying  training/certification  events  accomplished  during  formal  training  will  use  the course  completion  date  (successful  evaluation  date)  to  establish  the  due  dates  for  all subsequent currency requirements successfully completed during training. (T-3). 4.3.4.  Event descriptions and amplifying guidance is listed in  Attachment 3 of this AFI. 22 AFI11-2HC-130JV1  1 SEPTEMBER 2017 4.3.5.

Local Indoctrination Training. 24 AFI11-2HC-130JV1  1 SEPTEMBER 2017 4.4.1.  Units will develop a local indoctrination training plan for all newly assigned aircrew members.    Aircrew  members  will  complete  this  training  prior  to  flying  local  continuation training sorties unsupervised (T-2). 4.4.2.  Training is designed to familiarize newly assigned aircrew with the unit mission and local training areas (i.e. range space, DZs, LZs, local VFR flying pattern, etc.).  Completion of this training requires two sorties (one must be night) in local training areas and applicable ground  training.    Note:    If  all  requirements  are  met  on  a  single  night  sortie,  the  Unit Commander may waive the requirement for a second sortie on a case by case basis. 4.4.3.  Units will track completion of this training on the Letter of X’s (or equivalent) (T-2). 4.4.4.  Training  is  not  required  for  HQ  MAJCOM  and  NAF  personnel  conducting inspections/evaluations  when  accompanied  by  unit  assigned  and  locally  indoctrinated aircrew. 4.5.  Special Categories. 4.5.1.  Flight  Test  Engineers  (FTE).  FTEs  are  engineers  or  scientists  occupying  duty positions  requiring  them  to  conduct  or  participate  in  flight  test  missions on  a  regular  basis.  Any  ACC,  AFMC  or  ARC  FTE  assigned/attached  to  a  dedicated  test  organization,  on Aeronautical  Orders  and  authorized  to  fly  on  HC-130J  aircraft  (documented  on  AF  Form 480, Aircrew AFSC/Active Flying Justification) is permitted to fly on any HC-130J aircraft.  FTEs are authorized to log time as primary crewmembers when performing duties IAW AFI 65-503, US Air Force Cost and Planning Factors.  FTEs may fly to maintain proficiency and improve knowledge in employment of the weapon system when not performing test duties. 4.5.1.1.  For  operational  units  supporting  testing  requirements,  the  OG/CC  will  approve FTEs  to  fly  on  unit  aircraft  and  designate  the  HARM  office  to  track  currency requirements. (T-3). Duration of approval is at the discretion of the OG/CC and based on testing  support  requirements.    Approval  should  be  documented  as  a  memorandum  for record maintained by the HARM office. 4.5.1.2.  There are no flight currency requirements for FTEs.  FTEs will accomplish and maintain  ground  currencies  IAW  the  RTM.  (T-2).    Units  will  ensure  FTEs  receive adequate supervision/instruction when flying on unit assigned aircraft. (T-2).  An FTE’s Initial  HC-130J  flight  will include  a  briefing  emphasizing  crew  coordination, communications and the location/use of aircraft emergency equipment.  (T-2). 4.5.2.  Flight  Surgeons.  AFI  11-202V1  establishes  flight  surgeon  continuation  flying requirements.  Ground training requirements are the same as FTEs and IAW the RTM.  Units will  ensure  flight  surgeons  receive  adequate  supervision/instruction  when  flying  on  unit assigned  aircraft.  (T-2).    A  flight  surgeon’s  Initial  HC-130J  flight  will  include  a  briefing emphasizing crew coordination, communications and the location/use of aircraft emergency equipment.  (T-2). 4.5.3.  MAJCOM/NAF API-8/D Aircrew.  HHQ aircrew are attached to a flying unit IAW AFI  11-401.    Those  HHQ  aircrew  maintaining  BMC  status  are  exempt  from  specialized training  programs  within  authorized  mission  areas  and  are  not  required  to  meet  monthly lookback  sortie  requirements  IAW  the  RTM.    HHQ  aircrew  are  not  required  to  complete AFI11-2HC-130JV1  1 SEPTEMBER 2017 25 Local Orientation Training.  HHQ evaluator certified/instructor qualified crewmembers may perform duties if current and qualified for the applicable missions/events. 4.5.4.  RegAF  Crewmembers  Flying with ANG and AFRC Units.  RegAF crewmembers other  than  assigned  advisors  are  authorized  to  fly  with  reserve  component  units  under restrictions  identified  in  AFI  11-401.    Each  crewmember  will  present  documentation summarizing currencies, egress training, flight qualifications, etc., to the unit where flying is performed.  (T-2). 4.6.  Different  Series  C-130J  Certifications.  Difference  training  will  be  conducted  IAW Chapter 2. (T-2). 4.6.1.  HC-130J qualified aircrew may satisfy RAP requirements and update currency in MC-130J without additional approval provided differences training is accomplished. 4.7.  Re-Currency  Training.  Training  required  whenever  an  aircrew  member  does  not  meet  a currency requirement of this instruction.  Aircrew members will not perform any event in Table 4.1,    4.2,    4.3  in  which  they  are  non-current  unless  supervised  by  a  current  and  qualified instructor. (T-2). 4.7.1.  Loss  of  Currency  (up  to  6  Months).  Failure to maintain currency  IAW  Table 4.1,  4.2,    4.3 or as outlined in  the RTM, results in  a  loss of currency  for that  sortie/event.   The sortie/event may not be performed except for the purpose of regaining currency. (T-2). Noted BAQ  sortie/events  result  in  the  loss  of  aircraft  currency  and  member  will  be  placed  in supervised status until recurrent.  (T-2). 4.7.1.1.  Unless  specifically noted otherwise,  crewmembers are non-current  the calendar day after sortie/event currency expires. 4.7.1.2.  To  regain  currency,  delinquent  sortie/events  will  be  demonstrated  to  the satisfaction of an instructor.  The SQ/CC may direct additional training as required.  (T-2). 4.7.2.  Loss of Currency Exceeding 6 Months. 4.7.2.1.  Loss of currency for noted BAQ sortie/events identified in Table 4.1,  4.2,  4.3 in excess of six months results in the loss of BAQ.  (T-2).  Notify Squadron Standards & Evaluations of affected personnel immediately.  Requalification will be IAW paragraph 4.7.4. 4.7.2.2.  Loss  of  currency  for  noted  MSN  events  identified  in  Table  4.1,    4.2,    4.3  in excess  of  six  months  results  in  loss  of  mission  qualification.    (T-2).    Notify  Squadron Standards  &  Evaluations  of  affected  personnel  immediately.    Requalification  will  be IAW paragraph 4.7.4. 4.7.2.3.  Loss  of  currency  exceeding  6  months  but  less  than  36  months  for  instructor certified events results in loss of certification.  Crewmembers will accomplish training as directed by the SQ/CC and re-certification by an instructor.  (T-2). 4.7.2.4.  Loss  of  currency  exceeding  36  months  for  instructor  certified  events  results  in loss of certification.  Crewmembers will accomplish training as outlined in the Training Plan/SOI followed by recertification.  (T-2). 26 AFI11-2HC-130JV1  1 SEPTEMBER 2017 4.7.3.  Currency for Training North of  60° North Parallel.  Aircrew members assigned to units north of the 60° parallel will handle night/NVG currency as follows:  (T-2). 4.7.3.1.  Only  day  sortie/event  currencies  from  1  April  to  30  September  need  to  be maintained.  Consider all experienced crewmembers current for night sorties/events on 1 October  providing  day  currencies  have  been  maintained.    Inexperienced  crewmembers will regain night currency by demonstrating proficiency in delinquent sorties/events to an instructor. 4.7.3.2.  NVG  currency  does  not  need  to  be  maintained  from  1  April  through  30 September, however to remain BMC/CMR, currency will be regained by 31 October.  To regain  currency,  the  most  appropriate  instructors,  as  selected  by  the  SQ/CC  will  fly  an NVG  route.    Other  non-current  crewmembers  will  regain  currency  by  demonstrating proficiency to an instructor. 4.7.4.  Requalification  Training.  IAW  AFI  11-202V1,  AFI  11-202V2,  AFI  11-2HC-130JV2, and this instruction. 4.8.  N-BMC/N-CMR Regression.  Aircrew may be regressed to N-BMC or N-CMR for one or more  of  the  reasons  listed  in  the  following  s.    Exception:    HQ  AETC  determines  regression policy and guidance for FTU aircrew. 4.8.1.  While N-BMC/N-CMR, the SQ/CC will determine missions aircrew may perform and supervision required.  (T-2). 4.8.2.  Units  will  track  regression  of  all  aircrew  using  the  unit  certification  document  or approved unit developed product.  (T-2). 4.8.3.  Regression  for  Loss  of  Currency.  Currency  status  for  the  purpose  of  tracking  and reporting regression will be determined by units on the first duty day of each month. 4.8.3.1.  Aircrew delinquent for a ground training event affecting BMC/CMR status will be  regressed  to  N-BMC/N-CMR.    Crewmembers  will  accomplish  the  required  ground training IAW governing directives prior to recertification.  (T-2). 4.8.3.2.  Loss  of  Flying  Training  Currency.    Loss  of  currency  in  a  flight  training sortie/event  affecting  BMC/CMR  status  will  result  in  regression  to  N-BMC/N-CMR.  Crewmembers  will  regain  currency  in  the  delinquent  sortie/event  prior  to  being recertified  as  BMC/CMR.    (T-2).    Note:    N-BMC/N-CMR  crewmembers  may  fly unsupervised on CONUS and OCONUS missions if delinquent events are not flown, are not required for mission accomplishment, and do not result in loss in aircraft currency or qualification.    OG/CC  approval  is  required  for  other  than  local,  routine  or  non-contingency missions. 4.8.4.  Regression  for  Failure  to  Meet  RAP  Lookback  .    1-month  and  3-month  RAP lookback sortie requirements (rates) will be defined in the RTM.  Both 1-month and 3-month sortie lookback totals  will be calculated on the first duty day of each month  for both  BMC and CMR aircrew.  Only designated RAP sorties and contingency operations sorties may be used to determine lookback.  (T-2). 4.8.4.1.  Failure  to  meet  1-Month  sortie  lookback  requires  a  review  of  the  aircrew member’s  3-Month  RAP  sortie  history.    If  the  3-Month  lookback  has  been  met,  the aircrew  member  may,  at  SQ/CC  discretion,  remain  CMR/BMC.    Failure  to  meet  the  3-AFI11-2HC-130JV1  1 SEPTEMBER 2017 27 Month lookback will result in regression to N-CMR/N-BMC status or the individual may be placed in probation status for 1 month at discretion of the SQ/CC.  (T-2). 4.8.4.1.1.  Lookback  computations  for  new  aircrew  members  begin  following CMR/BMC  certification  (see  Figure  4.1).    New  aircrew  members  who  have  been CMR/BMC certified for less than 3 months must meet 1-month lookback to maintain status until a 3-month lookback is established.  (T-2).  SQ/CCs may apply probation rules if a new aircrew member fails to meet 1-month lookback while establishing 3-month lookback. 4.8.4.1.2.  Probation.  If SQ/CC chooses probation status for one month, the aircrew member  will  reestablish  a  1-month  lookback  at  the  end  of  the  probation  period  to remain  BMC/CMR.    Failure  to  establish  a  1-month  lookback  at  the  end  of  the probation period will result in regression to N-BMC/N-CMR.  (T-2). 4.8.4.1.2.1.  Probation  Documentation.    Units  will  document  probation  status  by placing an MFR in the individual’s training folder while on probation. (T-2). 4.8.4.1.3.  CMR/BMC  crewmembers  regressed  to  N-CMR/N-BMC  will  complete  a SQ/CC-approved  recertification  program.    Upon  completion  of  the  program, crewmembers will meet 1-month lookback prior to recertification as CMR/BMC. (T-2).  Missions  and  events  accomplished  during  the  recertification  program  apply toward monthly and training-cycle RAP requirements. 4.8.4.2.  For  aircrew  members  who  do  not  meet  lookback  requirements  throughout  the training cycle, the SQ/CC may elect to initiate the following actions: 4.8.4.2.1.  Remove the aircrew member from active flying status. 4.8.4.2.2.  Remove the aircrew member from a CMR manning position. 4.8.4.2.3.  Place  the  aircrew  member  in  a  commander  directed  training  program  to regain CMR status. 28 AFI11-2HC-130JV1  1 SEPTEMBER 2017 Figure 4.1.  RAP Lookback Flow.  4.8.5.  Regression  for  Failure  of  a  Periodic  Evaluation.  Aircrew  members  who  fail  a periodic evaluation will regress to N-CMR/N-BMC, as applicable. (T-2).  BMC or CMR will be  regained  upon  successful  re-accomplishment  of  evaluation  unless  additional  training  is deemed appropriate by the SQ/CC or SQ/DO.  (T-2). 4.9.  End-of-Cycle Training Requirements.  Aircrew who fail to complete RTM-defined, end-of-cycle  sortie/event  requirements  may  require  additional  training  depending  on  the  type  and magnitude of the deficiency.  In all cases, report training shortfalls IAW RTM guidance.  End-of-Cycle training requirements are based on the aircrew member’s experience level on the last day of the current training cycle.  (T-2).  NOTE:  Refer to  paragraph 4.10 to determine if proration can be applied. 4.9.1.  Failure to Meet End-of-Cycle Total RAP Sortie Requirements.  Aircrew failing to meet end-of-cycle total RAP sortie requirements may continue at CMR/BMC if both 1- and 3 month RAP lookback requirements are met and sortie deficiencies are deemed insignificant by the SQ/CC.  If the SQ/CC determines the sortie deficiency is significant or lookback is not met, the crewmember will regress to N-CMR/N-BMC.  To regain CMR/BMC status, aircrew will complete a SQ/CC approved recertification program.  (T-2). AFI11-2HC-130JV1  1 SEPTEMBER 2017 29 4.9.2.  Failure  to  Meet  End-of-Cycle  RAP  Event  Requirements.  Aircrew failing to meet end-of-cycle RAP event requirements will regress to N-BMC/N-CMR.  Prior to CMR/BMC recertification,  aircrew  will  complete  all  deficient  events  and  any  additional  training  as determined by the SQ/CC.  (T-2).  Remedial events may count towards total requirements for the new training cycle. 4.10.  Proration of End-of-Cycle Training Requirements.  At the end of the training cycle the SQ/CC may prorate training requirements for crewmembers when DNIF, emergency leave, and “non-  flying”  TDY/exercises/deployments  (ANG/AFRC:    mandatory  training  required  for civilian employment) preclude training for a portion of the training cycle.  Ordinary leave will not be considered as non-availability.  Extended bad weather or other environmental factors that preclude  the  unit  from  flying  for  more  than  15  consecutive  days  may  be  considered  as  non-availability.  Commanders will not prorate for time deployed for contingency operations unless the individual(s) were assigned to non-flying positions.  The following guidelines apply: (T-2). 4.10.1.  Proration  will  only  be  used  to  adjust  for  genuine  circumstances  of  training  non-availability, not to mask training or planning deficiencies.  (T-2). 4.10.2.  Proration  is  based  on  cumulative  days  of  non-availability  for  flying  during  the training  cycle.    Use  Table  4.4  to  determine  the  number  of  months  to  be  prorated  based  on cumulative calendar days of non-availability. 4.10.3.  If  IQT  or  MQT  is  completed  after  the  start  of  the  training  cycle,  prorate  training requirements for availability following completion of formal training. 4.10.4.  Newly assigned/converted crewmembers achieving CMR/BMC after the 15th of the month  are  considered  to  be  in  CT  on  the  first  day  of  the  following  month  for  proration purposes. The prorated share of RAP sorties will be completed in CT. (T-2). 4.10.5.  AAR requirements accomplished during MQT may be credited toward prorated CT requirements  if  accomplished  during  the  cycle  in  which  the  crewmember  was  declared CMR/BMC, unless specified otherwise by the MAJCOM in the RTM. 4.10.6.  An aircrew member’s last month on station prior to departing PCS may be prorated provided  1-month’s  proration  is  not  exceeded.    For  reporting  purposes,  an  individual departing  PCS  may  be  considered  CMR  during  a  period  of  60  days  from  the  date  of  last flight, or until loss of CMR currency, or sign in at new duty station. 4.10.7.

Hours  logged  in  the  EC/MC/HC/KC/C-130J  and  associated  WST  may  be  credited toward  PAA  and  Total  hours  requirements.    ‘Other’  flight  time  will  not  be  used  in calculating an individual’s PAA hours. (T-2). ‘Other’ flight time in excess of 100 hours will not be used in calculating an individual’s Total hours. (T-2).  2.  Total time for all aircraft flown in military service to include student time. Time accumulated must be in the aircrew member's current rating (i.e., pilot, navigator (CSO), etc.). (T-2).   See Note 1 regarding ‘Other’ time.  3. PQP (PAA): Pilots previously qualified as a Pilot in Command (authorized A-Code) in another MDS require 100 PAA prior to AC certification.  Other PQPs not previously qualified  as  a  PIC  require  300  PAA  (to  include  H/MC-130P/N  copilots/MPD transitioning to the HC-130J).  4.  OG/CC or equivalent may waive 10 percent of the total and PAA hours required for upgrade in all crew positions. A copy of the waiver must be filed in the individual’s training record. (T-2).  Students will provide the formal school registrar with a copy of this waiver. (T-2).  5.  See ETCA for determining appropriate C-130J initial qualification courses.    5.3.  Mission  Pilot  Development  (MPD).  MPD is the initial level of C-130 pilot development for  graduates  of  Specialized  Undergraduate  Pilot  Training  (SUPT).  During  initial  and  mission qualification training, MPD pilots are trained/qualified to fly in both the left and right seat. 5.3.1.  The  MPD  program  is  designed  to  season  and  train  pilots  to  become  aircraft commanders.  MPD pilots must be given opportunity to fly in both seats in order to maintain skills obtained during initial qualification and mission qualification training. 5.4.  MPD  Progression.  In-lieu  of  a  MAJCOM  training  plan,  units  will  manage  their  training accordingly  to  prepare  MPD  pilots  for  upgrade  to  Aircraft  Commander.  (T-2).    A  staged approach  is  recommended  to  track  MPD  progress.    Additionally,  units  will  develop  ground training plans for Stage 1 & 2 to ensure MPD progression in general knowledge, guidance, and regulations. (T-2). 5.4.1.  Stage  1  –  Proficiency.  Fly  sorties  from  either  seat  and  practice  executing  flying events safely.  MPD Stage 1 training should focus on proficiency, general knowledge, safety, and airmanship. 5.4.1.1.  Continuation  to  Stage  2  requires  completion  of  Stage  1  Workbook    and/or designated  ground  training  and  300  PAA  hours    (See  Table  5.1  Note  1  for  crediting hours).  Squadron Commanders or Operations Officers (DO) will review MPD progress and approve progression to Stage 2. (T-2). AFI11-2HC-130JV1  1 SEPTEMBER 2017 33 5.4.1.2.  Pilots  should  not  remain  in  MPD  Stage  1  longer  than  six  months  from  Initial Mission  Qualification  in  the  HC-130J;  however,  individual  performance  may  dictate extended  time  in  this  stage.    It  is  imperative  that  Instructors  provide  accurate documentation on MPD Stage 1 progression in critical areas (i.e. Max Effort procedures, AAR, etc.). (T-2). 5.4.2.  Stage  2  –  AC  Preparation.  Once  the  MPD  pilot  demonstrates  proficiency  in  the aircraft  begin  training  to  manage  profiles  and  practice  executing  the  mission  as  an  Aircraft Commander.    MPDs  in  Stage  2  must  focus  on  airmanship,  judgment,  and  decision  making while continuing improvement in proficiency and general knowledge. 5.4.2.1.  Continuation  to  Stage  3  requires  completion  of  Stage  2  Workbook  and/or designated  ground  training  and  the  upgrade  prerequisites  in  Table  5.1.    Squadron Commanders  or  Operations  Officers  (DO)  will  review  MPD  progress  and  approve progression to Stage 3. (T-2). 5.4.3.  Stage  3  –  Upgrade  Training.  MPD  pilots  enter  Stage  3  upon  beginning  Aircraft Commander certification training. The focus of Stage 3 is demonstrating ability to safely act as an Aircraft Commander.  See p paragraph 5.5 and Table 5.1. 5.4.4.  Stage  Progression  Tracking.  Units  will  track  MPD  progression  using  a  training Folder/AF Form 4022 (See Chapter 6 for additional requirements) .  (T-2).  Units will also track individual MPD Stage using the Letter of X’s (or equivalent), see Chapter 6. (T-2). 5.4.4.1.  Tracking  and  grading  of  specific  flight  maneuvers  on  AF  Form  4024  is  not required. 5.4.4.2.  Instructor  pilots  are  responsible  for  providing  training  documentation  and recommendations after all periods of instruction (both left and right seat sorties). Aircraft commanders  are  responsible  for  providing  documentation  and  recommendations  after off-station missions or as directed by SQ/DO. 5.4.4.3.  Unit Training Office will (T-2). 5.4.4.3.1.  Create standard AF Training Form overprints (if required). 5.4.4.3.2.  Ensure IPs and ACs complete required documentation. 5.4.4.3.3.  Ensure training folder reviews are completed and manage MPD PTFs. 5.4.4.3.4.  Review MPD pilot progress during the unit Training Review Panel (TRP) process  and  forward  metrics  regarding  unit  MPD  status  when  requested  by MAJCOM/A3T. 5.4.5.  Periodic Evaluations. MPD pilots will receive evaluations IAW AFI 11-2HC-130JV2. 5.5.  Aircraft Commander Upgrade. 5.5.1.  MPD  Aircraft  Commander  Upgrade.  In  lieu  of  a  MAJCOM  syllabus  of  instruction, training will be completed IAW a unit developed Aircraft Commander upgrade syllabus. (T-2).    Commanders  will  consider  experience,  knowledge  and  judgment  when  identifying candidates.  Nominees  must  have  an  in-depth  knowledge  of  systems,  procedures,  and instructions  prior  to  entry  into  this  upgrade  program.  Aircraft  commander  upgrade  is designed to teach MPD pilots AC duties and responsibilities. See  Table 5.1 for flying hour 34 AFI11-2HC-130JV1  1 SEPTEMBER 2017 prerequisites.  Aircraft  Commander  upgrade  training  culminates  with  a  recommendation  for Aircraft Commander certification. 5.5.2.  PQP  Aircraft  Commander  Upgrade.  Previously  qualified  pilots  fall  into  two categories,  previous  PICs  (A-coded)  and  those  not  previously  PICs  (previous  First  Pilots, Copilots,  MPDs,  etc).    Previous  PICs  awaiting  aircraft  commander  certification  will  be entered  into  a  unit  training  program  designed  to  provide  rescue  mission  experience  and prepare them to fly as aircraft commanders on a new aircraft (not required to be entered into the MPD program).  PQPs that were not previous PICs will enter a unit developed upgrade syllabus  (can  be  same  or  tailored  version  of  MPD  Aircraft  Commander  Upgrade  syllabus).   PQPs  will  not  act  as  pilot-in-command  until  meeting  prerequisites  IAW  Table  5.1  and certified by the SQ/CC. (T-1). 5.6.  Aircraft Commander  Certification.  Pilots will not fly as a pilot-in-command (PIC) until certified by the SQ/CC as an aircraft commander. (T-1). 5.6.1.  Pilots  normally  should  be  certified  as  an  aircraft  commander  within  120  days  of upgrade  training  completion  (or  meeting  prerequisites  for  Previous  PIC  PQP)  unless extenuating circumstances exist. 5.6.2.  BAQ-only  Aircraft  Commanders.  Pilots  who  meet  aircraft  commander  upgrade  hour prerequisites  of  Table  5.1  may  be  certified  as  BAQ-only  aircraft  commander.  Selected individuals  will  be  entered  into  a  unit-developed  certification  program  to  ensure  they  have the experience, knowledge and judgment to act in this capacity. (T-2). 5.7.  Aircrew  Instructor  Upgrade.  A  sound  and  practical  aircrew  instructor  program  is  a prerequisite  for  effective  training,  standardization  and  aircraft  mishap  prevention.  Unit commanders  will  personally  review  each  instructor  candidate‘s  qualifications  and  select instructors based on their background, experience, maturity,  and ability to instruct.  (T-2).    The following characteristics must be considered:  instructional  ability, judgment,  personal  qualities, technical knowledge, flying experience and tactical experience. (T-2). 5.7.1.  The primary method of initial instructor upgrade is to attend and complete the formal HC-130J instructor training course listed in  the  ETCA. When attendance is  not  practical  or no  quotas  exist,  units  will  request  a  secondary  method  training  waiver  to  conduct  in-unit qualification  training  using  formal  school  courseware  IAW  paragraph  1.13.    Exception: Aircrew members previously qualified as an instructor in any USAF aircraft may upgrade in unit without a waiver. 5.7.2.  Prerequisites. All initial instructor upgrade candidates (non-previous instructors) must be BMC/CMR in their unit‘s mission for a minimum of 6 months and meet the flying hour requirements  of  Table  5.1.  (T-2).  Candidates  will  also  meet  all  prerequisites  listed  in  the ETCA and the formal school syllabus. (T-2). 5.7.3.  Instructor Requalification. With OG/CC approval, crewmembers previously qualified as  USAF  aircrew  instructors  may  requalify  in-unit  without  secondary  method  training approval.  OG/CCs  should  take  into  consideration  the  previously  qualified  instructors‘ experience with rescue roles, missions and C2. They must meet requirements of paragraph 5.7.2.  (T-2). AFI11-2HC-130JV1  1 SEPTEMBER 2017 35 5.7.3.1.  Unit  commanders  determine  training  required  to  complete  upgrade.    The upgrade  training  will  culminate  in  an  Initial  Instructor  evaluation  (INIT  INSTR)  IAW AFI  11-202V2.    Unit  commanders  may  require  prior  instructors  to  attend  the  formal course. 5.8.  Flight Examiner Certification.  Flight examiners will be selected from the most qualified and  competent  instructors.  (T-2).    Units  will  certify  flight  examiners  IAW  AFI  11-202V2  as supplemented. (T-2). 5.9.  Special  Mission  Qualifications  (SMQ)  and  Aircrew  Certifications.  SQ/CCs will  select appropriately qualified crewmembers to maintain additional SMQs.  (T-2).  SMQs are normally conducted in  unit following MQT or requalification, but  may be taught  at  the formal school  as part of mission qualification training, as applicable. Table 5.2. provides a comprehensive list of HC-130J SMQs and aircrew certifications. 5.9.1.1.  A flight evaluation is required for special mission qualifications. (T-2).

The  unit  operations  officer  may  waive  the  training  folder  requirement  if  corrective action  or  additional  training  is  limited.  If  initiated,  the  instructor  or  flight  examiner  who evaluated  the  aircrew  member's  performance  will  enter  comments  pertinent  to  the  training deficiency  on  AF  Form  4023.  (T-2).      Use  the  existing  training  folder  for  end-of-course evaluations that result in additional training. 6.4.2.  At the unit commander's discretion, training folders for an individual undergoing more than  one  training  program  in  a  short  period  of  time  may  combine  all  training  into  one  AF Form  4022;  e.g.,  a  previous  instructor  in  the  MDS  upgrading  to  AC  may  have  his  or  her mission upgrade combined with instructor upgrade in the same folder. 6.4.3.  Access  to  Active  Training  Records.  Squadrons  will  maintain  the  active  training folders  for  their  personnel  in  a  location  readily  accessible  to  instructors  and  supervisory personnel. (T-2). The trainee may review his or her folder at any time. 40 AFI11-2HC-130JV1  1 SEPTEMBER 2017 6.4.4.  Instructor Procedures. The instructor or trainer will review the training folder prior to all  training  periods.  (T-2).  Those  areas  not  previously  accomplished  or  those,  in  which crewmembers  require  additional  training,  will  be  noted  for  possible  inclusion  during  the current training period. (T-2). 6.4.5.  Training  Folder/Ops  Review.    Operations  officers  will  review  active  training  folders quarterly, and flight commanders or squadron training representatives will conduct a monthly review. (T-2).  Squadron/ operations superintendents may conduct Ops Reviews for CEAs. 6.4.6.  Monthly  reviews  ensure  training  is  correctly  documented,  instructor  write-ups adequately  document  student  performance,  and  that  the  trainee  is  progressing  in  a satisfactory manner. 6.4.7.  Quarterly  reviews  should  consist  of  a  sampling  of  training  documentation.    The operations officer and Squadron/ operations superintendents for CEAs should take this time to  ensure  students  are  performing  up  to  standards  and  the  unit  training  program  is  meeting unit goals and vision. 6.4.8.  Review  Documentation.  Document  reviews  on  an  AF  Form  4023.  The  reviewer annotates "monthly review" or "quarterly review," as applicable, in the training period block.

Training records are closed out upon successful completion of  the  Training  Plan/SOI  or  when  training  is  terminated  for  other  reasons  (failure  to  progress, extended DNIF, etc.). 6.5.1.  Conduct a review of the training record to verify course requirements were completed and that the trainee demonstrated satisfactory performance throughout the course. 6.5.2.  Instructors/Evaluators document successful training completion by making an entry in the    AF  Form  4023  indicating  that  all  required  training  has  been  complete  to  a  satisfactory performance level and recommending follow on action (i.e. certification, evaluation, etc). 6.5.3.  The training folder (AF Form 4022) will remain ‘open’ until supporting records such as AF Form 8, Letter of Certifications (Letter of X’s), and ARMS updates are completed. (T-2). Once all actions related to the additional certification/qualification are complete, the unit training office generates an AF Form 4025 to close-out the training record.  Place a copy of the  AF  Form  4025  in  the  AF  Form  4022  (top  page  on  left  hand  side)  and  individual’s permanent training folder in Section IV. 6.5.4.  Document termination of training by making an entry in the AF Form 4023 indicating the reason for termination.  The unit training office generates an AF Form 4025 to close-out the training folder.  Place a copy of the AF Form 4025 in the AF Form 4022 (top page on left hand side) and individual’s permanent training folder in Section IV. 6.5.4.1.  Disposition of Active Training Folders. Squadron training offices will retain all AF Forms 4022 contents until one year after training close out.  (T-2). After one year or prior to a PCS, return the folder to the crewmember. 6.6.  Documenting  Aircrew  Certifications.  Certifications will be documented on a unit Letter of Certifications (Letter of X’s or equivalent).  (T-2). Units may maintain AF Form 4348 to track AFI11-2HC-130JV1  1 SEPTEMBER 2017 41 individual certifications.  If units use the AF Form 4348, place it in the permanent training folder in Section III. 6.7.  Letter of Certifications (Letter of X’s).  Units will maintain a Letter of Certifications that provides  the  SQ/CC  a  summary  document  of  assigned/attached  aircrew  certifications  and qualifications. (T-2).  In the absence of MAJCOM/Local guidance the Letter of Certifications are maintained as follows: 6.7.1.  Minimum Items.  Assigned and attached aircrew member’s rank, name, crew position, qualifications and certifications. 6.7.2.  Updates.    The  Letter  of  Certifications  will  only  be  updated  after  the  individual’s training  is  complete  and  the  appropriate  qualification/certification  documentation  has  been signed/verified by the approving authority. (T-2). 6.7.3.  Signature  and  Posting.    The  Letter  of  Certifications  will  be  published  monthly  and signed  by  the  SQ/CC  (or  designated  representative).  (T-2).    Electronic  signatures  are authorized.  Once signed, maintain the certification document in a central location so that it is readily available to squadron supervision.  This document is be considered the “Master” and any pen and ink updates will be initialed by the SQ/CC (or designated representative). (T-2). 6.8.  Instruction for AF Form 4022  .

"U"  –  Unsatisfactory;  aircrew  member  was  previously  proficient,  but  has regressed or progress is unsatisfactory. 6.10.9.  Total Number Required. Indicates the total repetitions of an event or task required by the course syllabus. 6.10.10.  Total  Number  Accomplished.  Total  of  the  number  of  repetitions  actually accomplished. 6.10.11.  Required Proficiency Level (RPL). RPL for the specific event and task. Each event and  task  has  a  performance  standard  designated  for  the  required  proficiency  level  the crewmember will achieve. In addition, each event and task may have (optional) a knowledge standard designated and used in the same manner as a performance standard. The standards for  specific  events  are  either  listed  in  the  applicable  master  task  list  (MTL)  and  evaluation standards document (ESD) for each weapon system or identified in this instruction. For those weapons  systems  that  do  not  have  any  RPL  listing,  all  events  have  an  RPL  of  "3"  for performance  and  "C"  for  knowledge  (if  knowledge  standards  are  used  in  addition  to performance  standards).  Exception:  One-time  events  required  for  familiarization  and  not listed in the MTL and ESD or specific weapon system instruction do not have performance and knowledge standard assigned. Performance and knowledge standards are listed in Table 6.1 6.10.11.1.  Regression.  Once  a  crewmember  has  received  “P”  for  an  event,  the  only subsequent grade allowed for that event is either “P” or “U”. Regression occurs when a maneuver is  graded  “U” after having  achieved “P” in  the same task. Regression from  a “P” to a “U” requires an explanation in the student‘s training folder (AF Form 4023). The overall  grade  is  at  the  instructor‘s  discretion.  For  regression,  the  student  regains proficiency  prior  to  the  end  of  the  block  of  training  in  order  to  be  recommended  for  a checkride (when applicable) or certification (when applicable). 6.10.11.2.  Proficiency  Advance.  In  order  to  recommend  a  crewmember  for  a  checkride (when applicable) or certification (associated with completion of training), the final grade for  each  event  will  meet  the  Required  Proficiency  Level  (RPL)  and  the  total  number accomplished will normally meet or exceed the Total Number Required.  EXCEPTION: Highly  proficient  crewmembers  may  be  “proficiency  advanced”  and  the  total  number accomplished may be less than the Total Number Required. (T-2). Table 6.1.  Event and Task Performance Standards. Code 1 Performance is: Extremely Limited Definition: Individual can do most activities only after being told or shown how. 46 2 3 Partially Proficient Proficient 4 Highly Proficient AFI11-2HC-130JV1  1 SEPTEMBER 2017 Individual  can  do  most  of  the  behaviors,  but  not  necessarily  to  the desired levels of speed, accuracy, and safety. Individual  can  do  and  show  others  how  to  do  the  behavior  in  an activity  at  the  minimum  acceptable  levels  of  speed,  accuracy,  and safety without the assistance of an instructor. For pilots,  proficiency may  involve  actual  aircraft  control  and/or  pilot  monitoring  duties. For  instructors,  proficiency  includes  the  ability  to  demonstrate, instruct, and supervise ground and flight activity. Individual  can  do  behaviors  in  an  activity  at  the  highest  level  of speed, accuracy and safety.
