Aircrew  Responsibility.  This  volume,  in  conjunction  with  other  governing  directives, prescribes those procedures applicable to the operation of E-3 aircraft under most circumstances. It  is  not  a  substitute  for  sound  judgment.  Procedures  not  specifically  addressed  may  be accomplished if they enhance safe and effective mission accomplishment. 1.2.  Deviations.  Deviations the MAJCOM/A3 unless an urgent requirement or an aircraft emergency dictates otherwise. In that case, the Pilot in Command (PIC) will take the appropriate action to safely recover the aircraft. require  specific  approval  of from these  procedures 1.3.  Waivers.  Tier waiver authorities (T-0, T-1, T-2, T-3) have been included to all mandated unit  compliance  items  (Wing  level  and  below)  as  prescribed  by  AFI  33-360,  Publications  and Forms Management  and AFI 11-202, Volume 3, General Flight Rules. Forward waiver requests through  appropriate  channels  to  the  MAJCOM/A3  for  approval.  All  approvals  will  include  an expiration date. ACC/A3TV and ACC/A3CA are Office of Collateral  Responsibility  (OCR) on all waiver requests to this AFI. 1.4.  Distribution.  Issue this volume to E-3 aircrew members IAW local procedures. AFI11-2E-3V3  2 MARCH 2016 7 Chapter 2 MISSION PLANNING 2.1.  Responsibilities.  The  responsibility  for  mission  planning  rests  with the  Aircraft Commander (AC). Preparation for mission tasking and subsequent execution is the responsibility of the Mission Crew Commander (MCC). The operations functions of the unit will support both efforts.  Flying  crews  may  perform  their  own  mission  planning  or  units  may  utilize  mission planning  teams  or  planning  cells  in  order  to  meet  mission  planning  requirements.  In  any  case, qualified individuals will be designated to perform mission planning and/or briefings. Units will develop  specific  procedures  to  ensure  all  aircrew  members  are  thoroughly  prepared  for  each flight. 2.2.  Forms  and  Logs.  Specific forms  will  be developed/specified  by  the  appropriate  group  commander  (T-3).  Existing  AF  and  MAJCOM forms should be used to the maximum extent possible. logs,  and  mission flight  plans, 2.3.  Fuel  Conservation.  Aircrew  and  mission  planners  will  manage  aviation  fuel  as  a  limited commodity and precious resource. Fuel optimization will be considered throughout all phases of mission planning  and execution (T-3). Excessive ramp  and  recovery  fuel adds to aircraft  gross weight and increases fuel consumption. Do not ferry extra fuel beyond optimum requirements for safe  mission  accomplishment  and  training  objectives  (T-3).  Aircrew  and  mission  planners  will optimize  flight  plans  and  flight  routing  for  fuel  efficiency.  In-flight  procedures  such  as climb/descent  profiles  and  power  settings  should  also  be  considered  for  efficient  fuel  usage. Aircrew should employ the following aviation fuel optimization measures without compromising flight safety or jeopardizing mission/training accomplishment: 2.3.1.  Optimize  fuel  loads.  Mission  plan  for  the  required  ramp  and  recovery  fuel.  Ensure ramp fuel is correct upon arrival at aircraft. 2.3.2.  Minimize APU use.  Use ground power units when practical. 2.3.3.  Delay engine start time. Establish and implement local engines start time standards. 2.3.4.  Minimize aircraft weight through optimized fuel loads and reduction of equipment not necessary to accomplish the mission. 2.3.5.  Establish Command and Control (C2) and flight following procedures to ensure timely notification  of  mission  changes/cancellations  to  avoid  unnecessary  or  unproductive  flight time. 2.4.  Navigational Charts. 2.4.1.  Annotate  an  appropriately  scaled  navigational  chart  with  the  route  of  flight  and  the following (T-3): 2.4.1.1.  Special Use Airspace (SUA) within the altitude structure and within 50 NM of the route of flight/orbit airspace per the AFPAM 11-216. 2.4.1.2.  Mission airspace/  E-3 orbit airspace with  Altitude blocks. For E-3 air refueling airspace, label RVIP, RVCP, AAR Exit Point and annotate any applicable restrictions. 2.4.1.3.  Emergency airfields sufficient to cover the route of flight. 8 AFI11-2E-3V3  2 MARCH 2016 2.4.1.4.  High terrain within 50 NM of the route of flight. 2.4.1.5.  ADIZ boundaries within 50 NM of the route of flight. 2.4.1.6.  Equal Time Point (ETP) and FIR boundaries as required. 2.4.2.  Annotate  an  Operational  Navigation  Chart  (ONC),  or  larger  scale,  with  the  planned departure/arrival airfield and the following: 2.4.2.1.  Planned departure/arrival procedure. 2.4.2.2.  Special Departure Procedure (SDP). 2.4.2.3.  Highest terrain or obstacle along expected route of flight. 2.4.2.4.  Highest  terrain  or  obstacle  within  30  NM.  NOTE:  Units  will,  if  necessary, specify flight plan requirements and procedures in their local chapters to meet specialized mission requirements. 2.5.  Mission  Planning  Requirements.  The  appropriate  group  commander  may  waive requirements contained in  this paragraph if deemed necessary to  accomplish  a specific mission (T-3). 2.5.1.  Briefings/Debriefings. 2.5.1.1.  The  AC/MCC  will  brief/debrief  all  crewmembers  to  ensure  safe/effective mission accomplishment (T-2). Locally developed briefing guides (developed IAW AFI 11-202V3)  will  be  used  to  provide  a  reference  list  of  items  that  apply  to  a  particular mission  and  will  be  used  as  the  basis  for  mission  planning  and  briefing  actions.  Brief items  in  any  logical  sequence,  and  those  items  understood  by  all  participants  may  be briefed as “Standard”. All aircrew members will attend these briefings unless excused by the  AC/MCC  or  unless  local  procedures  dictate  otherwise  (T-3).  NOTE:  Units  will develop and document guidance for items that are commonly briefed as “Standard.” The purpose of unit or local standards is to reduce the briefing time of administrative tasks to allow for concentration on the mission. In no case do these procedures relieve the aircrew of the responsibility to comply with USAF directives. Aircrew will use these procedures unless conditions, objectives or execution dictate the aircraft commander to brief as “non-standard.” 2.5.1.2.  Passengers. The AC will assign a crewmember to be responsible for passengers or  distinguished  visitors;  reference  Transportation  of  Passengers  in  paragraph    3.12  in this instruction for minimum responsibilities (T-3). 2.5.1.3.  Aircraft  and  Aircrew  Status.  Aircraft  status  will  be  obtained  on  the  day  of  the flight  from  the  appropriate  maintenance  unit  including  open  discrepancies  from  the  Air Force  Technical  Order  (AFTO)  Form  781A,  Maintenance  Discrepancy  and  Work Document. Aircrew status will be obtained from ARMS personnel. Aircraft and aircrew status will be briefed/addressed as appropriate. 2.5.1.4.  AWO-Assisted  Rendezvous.  Either  the  AC  or  Nav  will  review  the  Air-to-Air Refueling  (AAR)  rendezvous  procedures  and  techniques  with  the  AWO  in  charge  of assisting the rendezvous. The Nav will supply the AWO with the following information: AFI11-2E-3V3  2 MARCH 2016 9 2.5.1.4.1.  AAR Control Time (RVCT), AAR Initial Point (RVIP) and AAR Control Point (RVCP) coordinates in degrees LAT/LONG. 2.5.1.4.2.  AAR altitudes. 2.5.1.4.3.  Desired tanker offset and turn range, if necessary. 2.5.1.4.4.  Range and offset calls desired during the rendezvous. 2.5.1.4.5.  Any alternate procedures. 2.5.1.4.6.  Transponder codes (on day of flight, if available). 2.5.1.5.  AWO-Directed  Rendezvous.  The  AWO  will  brief  the  flight  deck  on  the  AAR rendezvous procedure to be employed. The AWO will brief the following information: 2.5.1.5.1.  AAR rendezvous type. 2.5.1.5.2.  AAR altitude. 2.5.1.5.3.  Anticipated turn ranges/direction. 2.5.1.6.  Orbit Planning. The AC and Nav will coordinate with the MCC, SD, ASO, and ECO to determine optimum orbit configuration based on tasking and orbit limitations. 2.5.2.  Mission  Crew  Planning.      The  following  items  will  be  accomplished  during  mission planning: 2.5.2.1.  MCC  will  ensure  mission  activities  are  planned  according  to  applicable checklists and guides. 2.5.2.2.  MCC,  SD,  ASO,  ECO,  and  the  CSO  will  develop  a  communication  plan  to ensure accomplishment of mission requirements. 2.5.2.3.  The  CDMT/ST  will  coordinate  all  computer  software  requirements.  Minimum software requirements will be IAW local operating procedures. 2.5.2.4.  The  MCC  will  assess  impact  of  equipment  limitations  and  adjust  tasking  as necessary. The MCC will conduct a final review of mission crew planning. 2.6.  Theater  Procedures  Aircrew  Aids.  The  unit  specifically  tasked  to  support  an  area  of operations  will  develop  theater  procedure  aircrew  aids  (classified/unclassified)  and  make  them available  to  the  crew  upon  implementation  of  a  contingency  Operations  Plan  (OPLAN)  for deployment to the theater (T-3).  As a minimum, these aids will include: 2.6.1.  Communications plans. 2.6.2.  Flight and mission crew positional actions/procedures. 2.6.3.  Rules of Engagement (ROE). 2.6.4.  Other information deemed necessary by the unit. 10 AFI11-2E-3V3  2 MARCH 2016 Chapter 3 AIRCREW OPERATING PROCEDURES 3.1.  PIC  Responsibilities.  SQ/CC  shall  designate  an  AC,  Instructor  Pilot  (IP),  or  Evaluator Pilot  (EP)  as  the  PIC  for  all  flights,  on  a  flight  authorization  form,  IAW  AFI  11-401,  Aviation Management, and applicable supplements. The PIC is responsible for the safe, effective conduct of flight operations. The aircrew is responsible to the PIC for the successful accomplishment of all  flight  activities  IAW  AFI  11-202V3  and  applicable  MAJCOM  supplements.    PIC responsibilities and/or authority include: 3.1.1.  Managing crew resources and safe mission accomplishment. 3.1.2.  Welfare of the crew. 3.1.3.  Final word for requesting or accepting any waivers affecting the crew or mission. 3.1.4.  Ensuring  that  any  portion  of  the  flight  affecting  the  accomplishment  of  the  E-3 mission is coordinated with the MCC. 3.2.  Crew Manning. 3.2.1.  Minimum flight crew manning includes the AC, Copilot (CP) or FP, Nav, and Flight Engineer (FE). 3.2.2.  Proficiency (P)-sorties will be flown with a minimum of five crewmembers: AC, CP, Nav,  FE,  and  one  additional  crewmember  to  act  as  safety  observer.  The  applicable Operations  Group  Commander  (OG/CC)  has  the  waiver  authority  to  authorize  a  flight without a safety observer (T-3). 3.2.3.  Minimum mission crew manning to power up the mission systems will include MCC, ASO,  ART,  CDMT/ST,  CT,  and  CSO.  Mission  crew  manning  may  vary  by  the  type  of mission flown (T-3). 3.2.4.  Normally, aircrew manning for operational employment will be IAW AFI 65-503, US Air Force Cost and Planning Factors, Table A36-1. Mission crew manning may vary by the type  of  mission  flown;  SQ/DO  or  DETCO  may  tailor  aircrew  manning  to  meet  operational requirements. 3.2.5.  Unless  waived  by  the  SQ  CC/DO,  inexperienced  CDMTs/STs  will  fly  with  an experienced  CDMT/ST,  and  inexperienced  ARTs  will  fly  with  an  experienced  ART,  at  all times, until certified experienced. 3.3.  Crew Rest/Flight Duty Period (FDP)/Crew Augmentation.  Crew rest, flight duty period and crew augmentation will be IAW AFI 11-202V3 and applicable MAJCOM supplements with the following additional guidance: 3.3.1.  With autopilot, altitude hold, or any axis of the autopilot inoperative, limit basic FDP to 12 hours and augmented FDP to 16 hours (T-2). 3.3.2.  Flight crew augmentation. 3.3.2.1.  In addition to the normal flight crew, minimum crew augmentation will consist of a qualified AC, NAV, and FE who are current in duties that will be performed on that AFI11-2E-3V3  2 MARCH 2016 11 sortie.    Adding  flight  crewmembers  after  the  first  takeoff  in  a  crew  duty  period  is  not considered augmentation. 3.3.2.2.  The applicable OG/CC (or as delegated) will determine the augmented mission crew composition depending upon mission requirements (T-3). 3.3.3.  Non-duty  Time.  Crewmembers  will  be  afforded  12  hours  of  non-duty  time  after  a flight before reporting for normal non-flying duties, unless waived by SQ CC/DO. 3.3.4.  Crew  Rest  Timing.  Crew  rest  for  successive  flight  activity  will  begin  when  the  last crewmember departs after completing related aircrew duties but not earlier than 1 hour after final landing from previous flight activity. 3.3.5.  Crew Rest for Deploying/Redeploying Aircrews. When transitioning four time zones or  more,  unless  waived  by  applicable  operations  group  commander,  ground  time  between landing  and  subsequent  takeoff  will  not  be  planned  for  less  than  18  hours.  This  does  not apply to “Ops stops” made within an aircrew duty period. 3.3.6.  Management  of  AFRC  Crewmembers.  The  on-scene  commander  or  E-3  DETCO  is responsible for the effective management of aircrews. An element of that responsibility is the effective use of the Reserve associate aircrew personnel during their periods of availability. There is no guarantee that missions will always be completed at scheduled Mission End Time (MET). Therefore, it is incumbent upon Reserve associate crew members to make available sufficient time to accommodate unavoidable delays in returning to home station. Scheduled Return  Time  (SRT)  will  be  calculated  MET  plus  24  hours  for  routine  exercise  and operational deployments. SRT(s) for contingencies and missions of unknown duration will be determined by the 513 ACG/CC and 552 OG/CC or the requesting authority in coordination with HQ AFRC. The SRT will be determined and placed on the initial and subsequent flight authorizations until the mission is complete. The overall objective is to recover aircrews on schedule and provide scheduling stability. Two essential elements of this concept are realistic determination  of  SRT(s)  based  on  mission  duration  and  conscientious  management  by  the on-scene commander or DETCO to ensure return of reserve associate aircrews by the MET. Except in uncontrollable or unusual circumstances, Reserve associate crewmembers must be assured that their missions will be complete within the SRT. The Reserve associate AC and MCC will  be provided a copy of all mission itinerary changes. Delays in return of Reserve associate personnel beyond their SRT will be coordinated through the 552 OG/CC, the 513 ACG/CC, and concurred with  by the aircrew. Every available means will be used to  return Reserve  associate  crewmembers  to  home  station  to  meet  the  SRT.  If  Reserve  associate aircrew  (or  members)  cannot  extend  past  the  SRT,  the  on-scene  commander  will  verify whether  military  or  contract  means  of  transportation  is  available.  If  no  such  means  are available,  the  on-scene  commander  or  DETCO  will  use  the  most  expeditious  means, including commercial air, to return Reserve associate personnel to home station. 3.4.  Pre-Mission Duties.  The AC in coordination with the MCC and DO/DETCO, may adjust crew  report time to  meet mission requirements. Crew report times will allow sufficient  time to accomplish  all  preflight  activities  IAW  locally  prescribed  guidance.  Normally  use  a  3+30  hour show  time  prior  to  takeoff  for  sorties  planned  and  flown  on  the  same  day,  unless  a  Mission Planning Team  (MPT) is utilized.  If  an MPT is  utilized,  the SQ/DO or  MPT will set  the show time.    The  FE  and  technicians  (CSO/CT/CDMT/ST/ART)  should  arrive  at  the  aircraft  1+30 12 AFI11-2E-3V3  2 MARCH 2016 hours prior to  the scheduled takeoff time. Crew show at  the aircraft for all other crewmembers will normally be no later than 1 hour prior to the scheduled takeoff time. 3.4.1.  On  the  day  of  the  mission,  aircrew  may  only  be  scheduled  for  duties  related  to  the mission, regardless of duty day. 3.5.  Minimum  Equipment.  The 552  OG is  the  Combat Air Force (CAF) lead  for developing and maintaining the Minimum Equipment List (MEL) for use by all AWACS units. The MEL is a guide to determine operable equipment required for safe flight. 552 OG will forward a copy of the MEL to HQ ACC/A3CA, HQ PACAF/A3T, and HQ AFRC/A3T. 3.6.  Communications. 3.6.1.  Required  Communication.  Communicate  the  following  to  the  applicable  command post  or  operations  center,  unless  local  directives  or  tactical  deception  requirements  specify otherwise: 3.6.1.1.  Maintenance discrepancies which will delay preflight or takeoff (AC). 3.6.1.2.  Engine start time (at least 10 minutes prior to engine start to allow notification of Central Security Control (CSC) when appropriate). (AC/CP) 3.6.1.3.  Anytime  equipment  malfunction  or  incident  occurs  that  will  adversely  affect mission accomplishment. (AC/MCC) 3.6.1.4.  Actual takeoff time. (Nav) 3.6.1.5.  Significant changes in mission timing. (Nav) 3.6.1.6.  Post-air refueling report. (CSO) (Optional per AC/MCC) 3.6.1.7.  On station/Ops Normal time (NLT 15 minutes after arriving on station). (CSO) (Optional per AC/MCC) 3.6.1.8.  Time off station (NLT 15 minutes after departing station). (CSO) (Optional per AC/MCC) 3.6.1.9.  Maintenance codes and Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) prior to final landing. (CSO) 3.6.1.10.  Revised  ETA  (if  changed  by more  than  15  minutes)  when  in  UHF  radio contact. (Nav) 3.6.1.11.  Sortie block time and flight duration. (Nav) 3.6.2.  Maintenance  Codes  (Aircraft  Landing  Status  and  System  Capability  Codes).  The  FE and each technician will provide the maintenance codes to the CSO prior to landing. Use the Aircraft Landing Status and System Capability Codes as defined in AFI 21-101, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Management, and applicable MAJCOM supplements. 3.7.  AWO-Assisted/Directed Rendezvous Responsibilities. 3.7.1.  AWO-Assisted Rendezvous. The AWO will provide information to assist the Nav in accomplishing  the  rendezvous  and  for  situational  awareness.  AWOs  will  execute  the rendezvous IAW with paragraph  2.5.1.4 of this AFI. AFI11-2E-3V3  2 MARCH 2016 13 3.7.1.1.  Communications.  Internal  coordination  between  the  Nav  and  AWO  during  the rendezvous will be over Net 1. Other crewmembers should minimize use of Net 1 for 30 minutes  before  the  AAR  Control  Time  (ARCT)  until  after  the  refueling  is  complete, unless safety of flight is in jeopardy. 3.7.1.2.  Procedures.  The  AWO  will  execute  the  pre-planned  type  of  rendezvous  as coordinated with the AC, Nav, and tanker. The AWO will pass bearing, range, and offset of  the  tanker  as  prebriefed/required.  When  directed  by  the  AC,  the  FE  will  advise  the AWO/MCC  when  to  terminate  mission  crew  assistance  and  when  the  mission  systems may be configured for AAR. 3.7.2.  AWO-Directed  Rendezvous.  The  SD  is  primarily  responsible  for  the  success  of  the AWO-directed  rendezvous.  The  AWO  will  brief  the  flight  deck  and  the  SD  on  the  A/R rendezvous  procedure  to  be  employed.  AWOs  will  execute  the  rendezvous  IAW  with paragraph  2.5.1.5 of this AFI. 3.7.2.1.  During  Directed  Rendezvous,  AWOs  will  voice  vectors,  altitude  changes  and any other directive calls over the primary AAR frequency. 3.8.  Radar  Radiation  Restrictions.  Do  not  radiate  the  mission  radar  at  or  below  transition flight level (FL) due to the potential for conflict with Visual Flight Rules (VFR) traffic that may pass  closer  than  650  feet  vertically  and  1,300  feet  horizontally.  However,  during  contingency operations, emergency situations, and special operations, the mission radar may be radiating at or below transition flight level within equipment limitations. 3.9.  On-Station Procedures. 3.9.1.  Navigator will notify the MCC of orbit intercept over Net 1 along with altitude, winds aloft,  and  any  changes  to  planned  orbit.  If  assuming  on-station  outside  of  the  orbit,  winds aloft should be briefed at this time. 3.9.2.  Fly  mission  orbits  at  best  endurance  indicated  airspeed  whenever  practical  but  not lower than maneuver speed for 30 degrees of bank. 3.10.  Aircraft  Position  Monitoring.  Aircraft  position  relative  to  a  preplanned  track  is  the responsibility  of  both  the  flight  and  mission  crews.  Aircraft  position  and  orbit  pattern  changes will  be  coordinated  between  the  MCC,  Nav,  and  AC.  The  applicable  Wing  Commander (WG/CC) may  waive the following requirements if deemed necessary to accomplish  a specific mission. 3.10.1.  Flight Crew Procedures: 3.10.1.1.  Pilots  will  monitor  the  E-3  position  via  Global  Positioning  System  Integrated Navigation System (GINS) and radio navigation aids (when within range). The AC will ensure separate steering solutions are selected on the AC and CP Control Display Units (CDU). 3.10.1.2.  The Nav, in coordination with the AC, will establish a radio navigation fix or line of position between the closest point of the E-3 orbit and the threat area as a “no fly beyond line” for all E-3 orbits. This information will be passed to the MCC. 14 AFI11-2E-3V3  2 MARCH 2016 3.10.1.3.  The  AC,  CP,  and  Nav  positions  will  be  occupied,  except  for  periods  of  crew relief, during flights within 25 NM of an established prohibited area or within 50 NM of a potentially hostile border. 3.10.1.4.  When flying in Warning Areas, Military Operating Areas, Restricted Areas, or Air Traffic Control (ATC) assigned working areas with other aircraft, the AC and MCC are responsible to ensure safe separation between the E-3 and other aircraft 3.10.2.  Mission Crew Procedures: 3.10.2.1.  The MCC must have at least a stand-behind position at an operational console, with access to monitor coordination and safety frequencies as required by the mission. 3.10.2.2.  The AWACS monitor and MCC must maintain awareness of the E-3’s position and  altitude.  Their  consoles  must  display  the  AWACS  DATA  LINK  net  participant symbol and they must have a means to determine E-3 altitude for deconfliction purposes.  E-3G  crew  members  will  use  E-3  Mode  C  pressure  altitude  information  when  making AWACS monitor calls.  It  is  acceptable  for the MCC to  momentarily have the AWACS DATA LINK net participant symbol not visible on their console, but it should not be for an extended period of time.  If the accuracy of the E-3 symbol is in doubt, consider worst case location, and coordinate with the flight deck to take immediate action to reposition the aircraft in order to avoid the prohibited/threat areas. 3.11.  AWACS Monitor. 3.11.1.  During flight under Due Regard when the mission radar or Identification, Friend or Foe  (IFF)  is  operating,  the  MCC  will  designate  an  AWACS  monitor  to  provide  traffic advisories  to  the  flight  crew.  At  any  other  time,  an  AWACS  monitor  may  be  utilized  as determined  by  the  PIC.  The  AWACS  monitor  will  notify  the  flight  crew  and  MCC  when AWACS  monitor  assumes  monitor  duties,  notify  the  MCC  when  monitor  responsibility changes  sections,  and  notify  both  the  flight  crew  and  MCC  whenever  AWACS  monitor  is terminated and should provide a brief explanation for the reason of termination. The MCC is ultimately responsible for ensuring that there is an AWACS monitor available. Normally, the AWO  providing  AWO-Assisted  AR  Rendezvous  or  AWO-Directed  AR  Rendezvous  will also perform AWACS monitor responsibilities. 3.11.2.  The  AWACS  monitor  will  pass  track  information  with  the  following  parameters  or as modified by the PIC: 3.11.2.1.  For ATC-controlled airspace: Tracks that are within ±1,000 feet (IFF Mode C) or 3,000 feet radar measured of E-3 altitude and 15 miles from the E-3, if the track is on a heading towards the E-3, overtaking, or passing in front of the E-3. 3.11.2.2.  For uncontrolled airspace: Tracks which are within ±3,000 feet of E-3 altitude and  15  miles  from  the  E-3,  if  the  track  is  on  a  heading  towards  the  E-3,  overtaking,  or passing in front of the E-3. 3.11.2.3.  Traffic  advisories  will  include  any  climbing/descending  and/or  maneuvering aircraft which could pose a threat to the E-3. 3.11.3.  Pass the tracks to the flight crew over Net 1 giving magnetic bearing (rounded to the nearest  10  degrees)  Note:  To increase  situational  awareness  and  promote  radio communication  deconfliction,  AWACS  monitor  should  monitor  ATC  frequency.  Range, AFI11-2E-3V3  2 MARCH 2016 15 altitude,  crossing  information  about  the  traffic  and  whether  the  track  altitude  is  radar measured or IFF reported. 3.12.  Transportation of Passengers. 3.12.1.  Space-A  Passengers.  Space-A  passengers  will  not  normally  fly  on  the  E-3  due  to mission and training requirements (T-3). 3.12.2.  Responsibility.  The  crewmember(s)  designated  by  the  AC  to  be  responsible  for passengers or distinguished visitors will: 3.12.2.1.  Supervise passenger movement, especially on the flight line. 3.12.2.2.  Assist passengers in locating assigned seats. 3.12.2.3.  Assist in familiarizing passengers with aircraft interior and survival equipment. 3.12.2.4.  Brief  all  passengers  according  to  AFI  11-202V3  (using  Attachment  3  of  this publication), prior to engine start. 3.12.2.5.  Assist and direct passengers in the event of an aircraft emergency. 3.12.3.  Loading/Off-loading: 3.12.3.1.  When appropriate, engines on the left side of the aircraft can be shut down and an  aircrew  member  will  be  positioned  at  the  bottom  of  the  steps  to  direct  loading/off- loading operations prior to any passengers entering or departing the aircraft. 3.12.3.2.  If  only  the  left  engines  are  shutdown,  the  TAXI  BACK  or  an  approved checklist for the given situation may be used. 3.12.4.  Passenger  Comfort.  Pilots  should  make  every  effort  to  enhance  the  comfort  of passengers.  Flight  operations  should  be  planned  for  the  minimum  use  of  drag  devices  and maneuvers which might cause discomfort or apprehension. 3.13.  Debriefings. 3.13.1.  Conduct the maintenance debriefing as soon as practical after engine shutdown. The AC,  MCC,  FE,  ART,  CDMT/ST,  CT,  and  any  crewmember  making  an  entry  in  the  AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document, will attend. 3.13.2.  If required, conduct an intelligence debriefing. 3.13.3.  Conduct a crew debriefing. 3.14.  Flying Clothing/Equipment. 3.14.1.  All  aircrew  members  will  wear  or  carry  the  minimum  items  of  clothing  and equipment  according  to  AFI  11-301V1,  AFI  36-3103,  AFI  11-202V3,  AFOSHSTD  48-20, AFOSHSTD  91-100  (T-1).  The  wear  of  flight  gloves  will  be  IAW  AFI  11-301  and MAJCOM/local supplements. (T-1) 3.14.2.  Keep  equipment  clear  of  all  entry  doors,  hatches  and  all  emergency  equipment during all ground and flight operations. The FE, CSO, and ART will ensure that these areas are  clear  of  obstructions  during  their  preflight  inspection.  It  is  the  responsibility  of  each crewmember  to  store/secure  their  personal  and  professional  equipment  carried  onboard. 16 AFI11-2E-3V3  2 MARCH 2016 Excess  personal  and  professional  gear  should  be  secured  in  the  J-compartment  (or  as directed). 3.15.  Aircraft Security at Enroute Stops/Destination. 3.15.1.  The  AC  is  responsible  for  ensuring  aircraft  security  at  enroute  stops.  Secure  the aircraft  as  a  Protection  Level  2  resource  IAW  AFI  31-101,  The  Air  Force  Installation Security  Program,  as  supplemented  by  MAJCOM.  This  requires  a  US  entry  controller  (at least one per every two aircraft) and restricted access. Provide a copy of the flight orders and passenger  manifest  (as  applicable)  to  the  entry  controller  as  a  way  to  identify  persons authorized entry to the aircraft as well as those crewmembers designated by the AC to have escort privileges. Perimeter patrol can be accomplished by host nation security, but the entry controller must be US security personnel or a US E-3 crewmember. In addition, equipment classified as SECRET (that cannot be removed from the aircraft) must be safeguarded by US security personnel or a US E-3 crewmember. Only the AC may release security forces from guarding the aircraft.  Waiver authority is the appropriate WG/CC. 3.15.2.  The  MCC,  or  AC  if  an  MCC  is  not  available,  is  responsible  for  the  security  of classified  mission  documents  and  software.  While  deployed  or  during  enroute  stops, COMSEC and software can be stored on the aircraft when U.S. security personnel are used as the entry controller. In the event of a stop at a location where no U.S. security personnel are available, COMSEC will be stored in the Command Post or the MCC/AC will designate crewmember(s) to remain with the software and COMSEC to provide security. 3.16.  Personal  Publications  Requirements.  Personal  Publications  Requirements.  Local  units will issue each crewmember publications IAW AFI 11-215, USAF Flight Manuals Program as supplemented. See local supplement to this publication for requirements listing. MAJCOMs may authorize the use of electronic publications through supplements to this AFI. 3.17.  Aircraft  Recall/Diversion.  Unless  received  over  secure  communications,  challenge  any recall  or  diversion  of  an  E-3  using  the  appropriate  authentication  for  the  theater  of  operation. Psorties do not require authentication. 3.18.  Transition Training. 3.18.1.  Do not conduct transition when scheduled takeoff or final landing is between 2400L and 0600L without SQ/DO approval (T-3). 3.18.2.  When performing transition with mission crew on board, the total transition time will not  exceed  2+30  hours,  with  the  exception  of  CTs/CSOs  on  P-sorties.  However,  do  not conduct more than 1+30 hours at one time without SQ/DO approval (T-3). 3.18.3.  Aircrews  may  conduct  off-station  transition  if  airfield  was  included  in  the  mission planning conducted prior to flight and approval was obtained by SQ/DO (or higher authority) (T-3). 3.18.3.1.  Aircrew  may  “drop-in”  to  airfields  designated  as  “familiar”  in  local supplements  without  pre-flight  mission  planning/approval.  The  PIC  will  ensure  current NOTAMS  are  reviewed,  be  familiar  with  the  airfield,  and  coordinate  with  SQ/DO  (or higher authority) prior to commencing descent to the airfield (T-3). 3.18.4.  Transition duty day is a period of 12 hours that starts and runs concurrently with the maximum flight duty period and applies to all flight deck crewmembers. Transition may be AFI11-2E-3V3  2 MARCH 2016 17 accomplished with additional crewmembers onboard that have exceeded transition duty day provided they are not occupying their primary flight crew duty position or performing flight crew instructor or Stan Eval Flight Examiner (SEFE) duties (T-2). 3.18.4.1.  The OG/CC can approve requests to extend transition duty day to 16 hours. 513 ACG may perform transition training on local training missions provided duty day does not exceed 16 hours and actual flying time does not exceed 12 hours (T-3). 3.19.  Crew  Coordination  Drills.  Thoroughly  plan,  brief  and  practice  simulated  crew coordination drills (i.e. Ditching, Crash Landing, Loss of Pressurization, Nuclear Event, Smoke or Fumes, and Fuselage Fire drills) during each training sortie when mission profile allows. The following procedures apply: 3.19.1.  The AC and MCC will coordinate prior to initiation, and make every effort to inform all instructors and evaluators of crew coordination drill timing in order to maximize training. 3.19.2.  Operational requirements will not be interrupted. 3.19.3.  Doors  and  hatches  will  not  be  opened  and  equipment  will  not  be  powered  down. However,  if  a  simulated  crew  coordination  drill  is  performed  after  calling  “off  station,”  a normal equipment power down may be incorporated into the drill in anticipation of landing the aircraft. 3.19.4.  If  passengers  are  onboard  during  the  drill,  passengers  will  be  briefed  but  will  not participate. 3.19.5.  The  AC  will  make  a  Public  Address  (PA)  announcement  at  the  start  of  the  crew coordination drill  vulnerability period, upon execution of the drill,  and  at the conclusion of the drill. 3.20.  Aircraft Cleanliness.  It is the AC and MCC’s responsibility to ensure the aircraft is clean and  orderly  after  a  mission.  All  crewmembers  are  responsible  for  removing  or  stowing  their personal and professional items prior to departing the aircraft. 3.21.  Aircraft  Configuration  for  Static  Display.  Whenever  an  E-3  is  on  static  display  and opened  for  viewing,  there  will  be  a  passenger  stand  at  each  open  door.  Hatches  will  only  be opened  when  an  aircrew  member  is  positioned  at  the  hatch.  ACs  will  ensure  proper safety/security precautions are taken to protect the aircraft, passengers and crew. AFI 11-209 and command  supplements  concerning  participation  in  static  displays  and  aerial  events  provide further guidance. 3.22.  Readiness Postures. 3.22.1.  Readiness Posture One (RP-1) denotes an aircraft and crew capable of launching in 1 hour from notification. Crews designated for RP-1 alert duty should normally be housed in a designated  alert  facility.  12  hours  of  pre-alert  crew  rest  is  required  prior  to  assuming  RP-1 alert (T-2). 3.22.2.  Readiness Posture Three (RP-3) denotes an aircraft and crew capable of launching in 3 hours from notification.  12 hours of pre-alert crew rest is required prior to assuming RP-3 alert (T-2). 3.22.3.  Readiness Posture Fifteen (RP-15) is not  an alert status, but denotes an aircraft and crew  capable  of  launching  15  hours  after  notification.    The  RP-15  crew  will  be  present  for 18 AFI11-2E-3V3  2 MARCH 2016 normal duty each day and carry pagers and/or cell phones for notification.  Crew rest begins at notification. 3.23.  Maximum flight duty period for RP-1, RP-3. 3.23.1.  Maximum  flight  duty  period  for  RP-1  and  RP-3  crews  is  12  hours  (16  hours  for augmented  crews)  (T-2).  RP-1/RP-3  flight  duty  period  extensions  will  be  IAW  MAJCOM Supplement to AFI 11-202V3. 3.23.2.  Alert  duty  scheduling,  flight  duty  on  alert,  and  maximum  number  of  days  on  alert will be IAW MAJCOM Sup to AFI 11-202V3. 3.24.  Post-Alert Compensation Time. 3.24.1.  If alert duty is performed away from normal quarters (e.g. alert facility or billeting) for a period of 96 hours or more,  compensation  time off will be 1 day  for every 4 days on alert  duty,  unless  waived  by  the  applicable  group  commander  or  designated  representative (T-3). 3.24.2.  No compensatory time is authorized if alert duty was performed in normal quarters. AFI11-2E-3V3  2 MARCH 2016 19 Chapter 4 FLIGHT CREW OPERATING PROCEDURES 4.1.  Adverse  Weather.  Refer  to  AFH  11-203,  Volumes  1  and  2,  Weather  for  Aircrews,  for familiarization with weather, weather services, and products. 4.1.1.  Icing Restrictions.  Flight into areas of forecast or reported severe icing is prohibited (T-2). Prolonged operation, such as cruise flight or holding, in areas of moderate icing should be  avoided.  When  freezing  fog,  freezing  drizzle,  or  freezing  rain  is  forecast  or  reported, aircrew  will  confirm  with  supporting  weather  personnel  the  intensity  and  type  of  icing associated with the freezing precipitation. 4.1.1.1.  Do not  takeoff  under  conditions  of freezing precipitation  as defined by  AFI11-202V3 (T-2). 4.1.1.2.  Freezing/frozen  precipitation  (freezing  rain,  drizzle,  snow,  fog,  or  temperatures near  0o  C,  etc.)  may  cause  ice  or  frost  to  accumulate  on  aircraft  surfaces.  When  an aircraft requires deicing/anti-icing prior to takeoff, refer to the following: 4.1.1.2.1.  Flight crew will be familiar with and follow all procedures and restrictions in  T.O.  1E-3A-1,  Flight  Manual  and  T.O.  1E-3A-1-1,  Performance  Manual,  with respect  to  deice/anti-ice  procedures.  Further  guidance  is  provided  in  T.O.  42C-1-2, Aircraft Anti-icing Procedures. 4.1.1.2.2.  MIL-A-8243  Type  I  and  Type  II  de-icing  fluids  do  not  provide  any  anti- icing benefit, and therefore do not have holdover times. As a guide, for approved anti-icing  fluids,  crews  may  use  published  anti-icing  holdover  times  IAW  T.O.  42C-1-2 and  winter  season  holdover  tables  available  on  the  AFFSA  website.  Caution:  The guidelines  may  not  be  consistent  with  Federally-approved  weather  intensity definitions  used  by  qualified  National  Weather  Service,  FAA  or  AF  weather personnel in developing forecasts or official weather observation reporting.   4.1.1.2.2.1.  The holdover time begins when anti-icing fluid is first applied and is affected by intensity/type of precipitation, time, temperature, and type/dilution of mixture.  PIC  shall  use  this  information  to  determine  when  holdover  time  is exceeded and re-apply fluid if required. 4.1.1.2.3.  The PIC will ensure the following information (4-element code) is received from the deicing ground crew after anti-icing is complete: 4.1.1.2.3.1.  Element  A.  Element  A  specifies  the  type  of  anti-icing  fluid  (e.g. Type IV). 4.1.1.2.3.2.  Element  B.  Element  B  specifies  the  percentage  of  fluid  within  the fluid/water mixture (e.g. 75/25 is 75% fluid and 25% water). 4.1.1.2.3.3.  Element  C.  Element  C  specifies  the  time  of  the  beginning  of  the anti-icing step. All holdover times are based on this value. All times are based on Local (L) time. 4.1.1.2.3.4.  Element D.  Element D specifies the date (day, written month, year). 20 AFI11-2E-3V3  2 MARCH 2016 The date will be consistent with local time. 4.1.1.2.4.  In  all  cases,  PICs  will  ensure  a  visual  inspection  is  completed  within  5 minutes of departure. 4.1.2.  Turbulence Restrictions.  Flight into areas of forecast or reported severe turbulence is prohibited (T-2).  Every effort will be made to avoid areas of reported moderate turbulence. If moderate turbulence is forecast  along the planned route of  flight,  the  AC will coordinate with weather personnel as to the best course of action to vacate the condition, if encountered. 4.1.2.1.  Crews  will  confirm,  if  possible,  the  type  of  aircraft  the  forecast  turbulence applies to, or what type of aircraft reported the encounter, to gain a more accurate picture of the route of flight. 4.1.2.2.  The PIC is  responsible for ensuring all aircrew/passengers are seated, with seat belts  fastened,  when  areas  of  moderate  or  greater  turbulence  are  encountered  or anticipated. 4.1.3.  Thunderstorm Avoidance.  Pilots will neither file a flight plan nor fly into an area of known or forecasted thunderstorm activity when the weather radar is inoperative or unusable and  thunderstorm  activity  cannot  be  visually  circumnavigated  (T-2).    During  flight,  avoid thunderstorms by at least: 4.1.3.1.  20 NM at or above FL 230. 4.1.3.2.  10 NM below FL 230. 4.1.3.3.  In the vicinity of the airport, maintain at least 5 NM separation from heavy rain showers.  Note:  Approaches  or  departures  may  be  authorized  by  the  appropriate  group commander if thunderstorms are officially observed to be closer than 10 NM (but not less than  5  NM)  from  the  airport.  IAW  AFI  11-202V3,  the  thunderstorm  must  not  be producing  any  hazardous  conditions  (such  as  hail,  lightning,  strong  winds,  gust  fronts, heavy rain, wind shear, or microburst) at the airport, and must not be forecast or observed to  be  moving  in  the  direction  of  the  route  of  flight  (to  include  the  planned  missed approach corridor, if applicable) (T-2). 4.1.4.  Lightning  Avoidance.  The  following  conditions  are  most  conducive  to  lightning strikes and prolonged flight in them should be avoided: 4.1.4.1.  Within ± 8oC or ± 5,000 feet of the freezing level. 4.1.4.2.  In  clouds  or  in  any  intensity  of  precipitation  or  turbulence  associated  with thunderstorm activity. 4.1.5.  Destination  Requirements  (for  filing  purposes).  An  alternate  will  be  filed  if  forecast destination  weather  does  not  satisfy  AFI  11-202V3  requirements  and/or  forecast  surface winds (intermittent or prevailing) exceed appropriate RCR limits. 4.2.  Takeoff and Landing Data (TOLD)/Restrictions. 4.2.1.  A  Flight  Engineer  will  compute  all  initial  takeoff  and  landing  data  during  mission planning  utilizing  an  authorized  TOLD  computer  program  or  T.O.  1E-3A-1-1.  A  Pilot  or additional Flight Engineer will crosscheck this data using the computer program or T.O. 1E-AFI11-2E-3V3  2 MARCH 2016 21 3A-1-1.   Either the initial  computation  or crosscheck of TOLD data will be done using the T.O. 1E-3A-1-1 or FPS. 4.2.1.1.  The  applicable  group  commander  may  authorize  use  of  Mission Accomplishment when operational/contingency missions dictate (T-3). Planning  Methods, IAW T.O. 1E-3A-1-1, 4.2.2.  Rolling  Takeoffs.  Rolling  takeoffs  are  authorized  (and  with  a  crosswind  component above 20 knots required) IAW T.O. 1E-3A-1. Make rolling takeoffs whenever appropriate. 4.2.3.  Reduced  Power  Takeoffs.  The  following  information  is  provided  in  addition  to  that found in T.O. 1E-3A-1-1: 4.2.3.1.  Whenever practical, a reduced power takeoff should be made. 4.2.3.2.  Actual  inboard  takeoff  rated  thrust  (TRT)  will  be  displayed  on  the  inboard exhaust pressure ratio (EPR) bugs for quick reference in the event TRT is required. 4.2.3.3.  Reduced  thrust  takeoffs  may  be  accomplished  on  a  wet  runway  IAW  T.O.  1E-3A-1 and T.O. 1E-3A-1-1. 4.2.3.4.  Reduced  thrust  takeoffs  are  permitted  with  falling  precipitation  provided precipitation is not moderate to heavy. 4.2.4.  Tailwind Takeoffs. Takeoffs with tailwinds are not recommended unless required by operational considerations. If a tailwind takeoff is made, a maximum component of 10 knots may exist provided data does not exceed allowable T.O. 1E-3A-1-1 limits. 4.2.5.  Crosswind. 4.2.5.1.  Unless  further  restricted  by  aircraft  gross  weight  or  emergency  conditions,  the maximum crosswind component (gust included) for takeoff and landing with RCR 26/23 is  25  knots,  RCR  15  is  20  knots,  RCR  10  is  15  knots.  If  RCR  falls  between  the  above RCR  values,  use  next  lower  RCR  restrictions.  Operation  at  higher  crosswind  values requires specific approval by applicable group commander. 4.2.5.2.  Copilots  are  limited  to  a  maximum  takeoff/landing  component  of  15    knots unless under IP/SEFE supervision. 4.2.6.  Runway and Taxiway. IAW MAJCOM directives, minimum runway length and width for takeoff or landing is 7,000 x 135 feet unless waived by OG/CC. Minimum taxiway width is 75 feet unless waived by OG/CC. 4.2.6.1.  Aircraft will normally takeoff and land on the longest suitable runway available. 4.2.6.2.  Intersection  takeoffs  are  not  recommended  and  will  not  be  performed  unless operational necessity dictates.  In such a situation, follow MAJCOM directives. 4.2.7.  Runway  Condition  Reading  (RCR).  Aircraft  will  not  takeoff  or  land  when  reported RCR is less than 10.  The applicable OG/CC has the authority to waive the minimum RCR to 7 when operational necessity warrants (T-3).  Do not taxi with an RCR less than 7 (T-2).  In cases of an unknown RCR or RCR less than 7, E-3 maintenance personnel are authorized to tow the E-3 with crew onboard to an area of known RCR of 7 or greater.  E-3 Maintenance personnel will comply with current 91-203 restrictions by complying with ORM assessment and approval requirements. 22 AFI11-2E-3V3  2 MARCH 2016 4.2.8.  Noise  Abatement.    IAW  T.O.  1E-3A-1  and  T.O.  1E-3A-1-1  guidance.  An  engine failure  or  other  emergency  condition  during  takeoff  is  a  non-normal  condition  and  takes precedence over published noise abatement procedures. 4.2.9.  Landings.  Except in emergency situations, the following apply: 4.2.9.1.  Computed  landing  distance  plus  1,000  feet  must  not  exceed  runway  available. (T-3) 4.2.9.2.  Full stop landings with less than 40 degrees of flaps are not permitted. 4.2.9.3.  If it appears that  the actual touchdown  will occur beyond the  first  1/3  or 3,000 feet (whichever is less) of the runway length, Pilots will go-around. 4.2.9.4.  Make no more than one full stop  in  a 30 minute period. When performing taxi back  type  operations  and/or  multiple  full  stop  landings,  observe  brake  limitations  and cooling procedures IAW T.O. 1E-3A-1 and T.O. 1E-3A-1-1. 4.2.10.  Missed  Approach.  Prior  to  starting  an  instrument  approach,  the  AC  will  ensure performance  complies  with  missed  approach  climb  gradient  requirements  IAW  AFI  11-202V3.  For planning purposes, base performance on the expected go-around configuration. 4.3.  Takeoff and Landing Policy. 4.3.1.  Aircraft Commander Responsibilities. 4.3.1.1.  A qualified AC will make all takeoffs and landings when either of the following conditions exist: 4.3.1.1.1.  When weather is below 300’ ceiling and/or 1 statute mile (SM) visibility. 4.3.1.1.2.  A distinguished visitor (Code 4, Code 4 equivalent, or higher) is on board as  a  passenger.  NOTE:  IPs  may  takeoff  or  land  in  either  seat  under  the  conditions above; however, a copilot will not occupy the left seat. 4.3.1.2.  An  AC,  IP,  or  SEFE  will  make  all  approaches  and  landings  during  aircraft emergencies, unless conditions prevent compliance. 4.3.2.  Copilot Takeoffs and Landings. 4.3.2.1.  Copilots may perform takeoff and landings if the weather is at least 300’ ceiling and 1 SM visibility, or published minimums, whichever is higher. 4.3.2.2.  During takeoffs and landings CPs must be properly supervised by an IP/SEFE or certified AC. 4.3.2.2.1.  An  AC  must  have  100  primary  CMR  hours  in  order  to  be  certified  to supervise  Copilot  takeoffs  and  landings,  recommendation  from  an  IP,  and  SQ/CC approval.  NOTE: OG/CC may waive the hours requirement (T-3). 4.3.2.3.  CPs  must  be  certified  by  the  SQ/CC  as  “experienced”  in  order  to  accomplish takeoffs  and/or  landings  under  the  supervision  of  an  experienced  AC  with  passengers onboard (no DVs Code 4 or higher). 4.4.  Touch-and-Go  Landings.  Accomplish conditions: touch-and-go landings  under the  following AFI11-2E-3V3  2 MARCH 2016 23 4.4.1.  IP/SEFE supervision. 4.4.2.  Minimum weather required is 300’ ceiling and 1 SM visibility. 4.4.3.  Crosswind  component does not  exceed the following (including  gusts): Dry runway-15 knots; wet runway-10 knots. 4.4.4.  No passengers on board. 4.4.4.1.  The  following  are  not  considered  passengers  for  this  restriction:  Wing supervisors,  E-3  maintenance  personnel,  USAF  Aircrew  qualified  in  other  aircraft, AFA/AFROTC cadets, FAA/ATC personnel, weapons directors, ACC TRSS Detachment 6  personnel  not  on  aeronautical  orders,  Airborne  Command  Element  (ACE)  team members,  Mission  Essential  Personnel  (MEP),  Security  Forces,  Intelligence  personnel, and  US  customs  personnel  flying  under  the  provisions  of  AFI  11-401  and  MAJCOM supplement (T-2). 4.4.4.2.  The following are not  considered passengers for this restriction  with applicable group commander approval prior to takeoff: military members not on aeronautical orders who are awaiting training, Computer Support Group (CSG) personnel conducting inflight software  testing,  and  Mission  Crew  Training  (MCT)  and  Flight  Crew  Training  (FCT) contract instructors in direct support of training and operations (T-3). 4.4.5.  The  following  length/width  criteria  apply:  Dry  runway--9,000  feet  x  135  feet minimum; wet runway--10,000 feet x 135 feet minimum. On a wet runway, touchdown in the first 2,000 feet of the runway or initiate a go-around (T-2). 4.4.6.  On  wet  runways,  conduct  touch-and-go  landings  at  flaps  50  degrees  only.  On  wet runways,  display  the  actual  charted  go-around  EPR  on  the  inboard  EPR  “bugs”  for  quick reference  in  the  event  go-around  EPR  is  required  while  airborne.  Outboard  EPR  “bugs” should  display  1.50  EPR.  Wet  runway  touch-and-go  landings  are  permitted  with  falling precipitation (i.e., drizzle or light rain), provided the precipitation is not moderate to heavy, not producing a runway surface condition (RSC), and it can be determined that water is not pooling on the runway. 4.4.7.  Runway  is  free  of  all  snow,  ice,  and  slush.  This  does  not  preclude  touch-and-go landings provided the RCR is  reported  as 10 or  higher. Flight  crews will use the  following standard: landing surface (67.5 feet left  and right of centerline) is completely clear of slush and the minimum RCR reading for any portion of the runway is 10. 4.5.  Inflight Simulated Emergency/Engine-Out Procedures. 4.5.1.  Inflight,  prior  to  simulated  emergency  procedures,  the  IP/AC  must  alert  all crewmembers in the cockpit. 4.5.2.  In  an  actual  emergency,  all  Student  Pilot/Copilot  training  and  simulated  emergency procedures will be terminated. Training will resume only when the AC has determined that no hazard to safe aircraft operation exists. 4.5.3.  Except  for  simulated  engine-out  landings,  restore  all  aircraft  systems  to  normal operation prior to landing. 4.5.4.  IP/SEFE supervision is required for all touch-and-go landings and flaps 14, flaps 25, and  flaps  25  to  50  approaches/landings.  Prior  to  performing  a  flaps  14  approach/landing, 24 AFI11-2E-3V3  2 MARCH 2016 update the brake energy limited landing weight and landing distance limited landing weight and  brief  differences  to  normal  configuration  habit  patterns,  emphasizing  gear  lowering sequence. 4.5.5.  Simulated engine-out maneuver restrictions (inflight): 4.5.5.1.  Simulated engine-out takeoffs are prohibited. 4.5.5.2.  Simulated two-engine operations are prohibited. 4.5.5.3.  Do  not  accomplish  actual  engine  shutdown  inflight.  A  reduction  in  thrust  can adequately simulate training in aircraft control procedures. 4.5.5.4.  Limit all inflight simulated engine-out activity to a gross weight of 270,000 lbs or less, with rudder boost on. 4.5.5.5.  Pilots  performing  simulated  engineout  touchandgo  landings  will  follow  normal fourengine takeoff procedures. 4.5.5.6.  No  passengers  on  board.  Do  not  consider  Flight  Crew  Training  (FCT)  contract instructors in direct support of training and operations as passengers for this restriction. 4.5.5.7.  ACs/FPs  certified  to  do  so  by  their  SQ/CC,  IAW  local  supplements,  may accomplish  simulated  engine-out  missed  approaches,  go-arounds,  and  full-stop  landings in VMC (day or night) without IP/SEFE supervision. 4.5.5.8.  All planned simulated engine-out missed approaches/go-arounds will be initiated no lower than 200 feet height above touchdown. 4.5.5.9.  During  a  simulated  engine-out  approach,  if  an  unplanned  go-around  or  missed approach is executed, establish symmetrical thrust on all engines when safe and practical. 4.5.5.10.  Aircraft in day IMC require weather conditions at or above published circling minimums for the approach to be flown. 4.5.5.11.  Aircraft  at  night  require  weather  conditions  at  or  above  1,000’  ceiling  and  2 SMs visibility or circling minimums, whichever is higher. 4.6.  Landing  Attitude  Demonstrations.  Landing  attitude  demonstrations  may  only  be accomplished by IP/SEFEs or ACs under IP/SEFE supervision. The following restrictions apply: 4.6.1.  Must be accomplished four engine only. 4.6.2.  Dry runway only. 4.6.3.  Flaps 40 or 50 only. 4.6.4.  Normal dry runway touch-and-go conditions and restrictions apply. 4.6.5.  Go-around will be initiated if aircraft touches down during the initial roundout. 4.6.6.  Go-around will be initiated with no less than 4,000 feet of runway remaining. 4.7.  Preflight. 4.7.1.  When  VIP  Stand  or  Air  Stairs  are  unavailable,  crews  will  arm  escape  slides  at unopened doors to facilitate a rapid ground egress should one become necessary. AFI11-2E-3V3  2 MARCH 2016 25 4.7.2.  Receiver  Autonomous  Integrity  Monitoring  (RAIM)  will  normally  be  enabled  at  all times. 4.7.3.  UTONAV will normally be enabled for INU ground alignment. 4.7.4.  To confirm proper INU alignment, the Nav will check the INU true headings prior to engine start and confirm they are within 1 degree of each other and cross-checked with the Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS). 4.8.  Engine Start/Taxi. 4.8.1.  When using a motorized staircase vehicle (Very Important Person (VIP) Stand or Air Stairs), aircrews will close entry doors prior to the removal or placement of the stands. 4.8.2.  The occupants of both Pilot seats will have their seat belt fastened while taxiing and will also wear their shoulder harness during critical phases of flight. 4.8.3.  Taxi  speed  in  the  parking  area  or  any  congested  area  will  be  slow  enough  to accommodate a wing walker. 4.8.4.  The Navigator will monitor GINS ground speed during taxi operations. 4.8.5.  The Navigator will use the weather radar to scan the departure path prior to takeoff to avoid flying into areas of heavy precipitation and/or possible associated turbulence. 4.8.6.  At the hammerhead, flight crews will verify the accuracy of the GINS position. 4.9.  Frequency Monitoring.  The AC, CP, Nav, and FE will monitor the briefed primary radio frequency during all phases of flight  unless directed otherwise by the  AC. The AC  will ensure VHF  guard,  UHF  guard,  and  mission  interphone  are  monitored  at  all  times.  All  flight  deck crewmembers will normally monitor UHF/VHF guard.  During critical phases of flight, only one flight  deck  crewmember  (minimum)  is  required  to  monitor  guard.    Pilots  have  the  option  to monitor guard during critical phases of flight based on current workload. C2 or other frequencies to be monitored will be designated by the AC. The observer’s seat occupant will be briefed on the  relationship  between  the  AC’s  Audio  Distribution  System  (ADS)  and  the  observer’s interphone to prevent extraneous radio transmissions. 4.10.  Altitude Monitoring.  When climbing or descending, the Pilot not flying or the Navigator will  call  1,000  feet  above/below  and  approaching  level  off  (within  200  feet)  altitude.  While operating at less than 2,000 feet above the ground, the Pilot not flying the aircraft will inform the Pilot  at  the  controls  anytime  the  indicated  altitude  varies  more  than  100  feet  from  the  desired altitude,  or  if  the  aircraft  appears  to  be  dangerously  close  to  terrain  or  obstructions.  The Navigator will back up the Pilots in observing and reporting these deviations. 4.11.  Departure. 4.11.1.  Departure  Planning.  Use  AFI  11-202V3,  AFMAN  11-217V1,  Instrument  Flight Procedures,  this  chapter,  and  the  appropriate  MAJCOM  supplements.  During  mission planning,  the  flight  crew  will  determine  a  gross  weight  that  ensures  E-3  performance  will meet or exceed departure requirements. Note: In the event E-3 performance is unable to meet the published climb gradient at the desired gross weight, down load fuel, use other applicable approved methods described below, or delay until more favorable conditions exist. 26 AFI11-2E-3V3  2 MARCH 2016 4.11.2.  Vertically  Clear  all  Obstacles.  Crews  will  calculate  climb  gradient  data  using  T.O. 1E-3A-1-1  to  ensure  they  are  able  to  meet  the  200  ft/nm  or  required  published  climb gradient.    If  the  performance  required  to  accomplish  the  mission  cannot  be  achieved,  and with  OG/CC  approval,  crews  can  subtract  48  ft/nm  from  the  published  climb  gradient.  If required  performance  still  can’t  be  achieved,  crews  may  use  SDPs,  with  OG/CC  approval. Note:  OG/CCs  may  delegate  approval  authority  down  to  the  SQ/CC  or  DO  as  specified  in the unit’s supplement (T-3). 4.11.3.  Special Departure Procedures (SDP) use and certification (IAW AFI 11-202V3). 4.11.3.1.  E-3 crews are authorized to use SDPs. 4.11.3.1.1.  The applicable OG will determine who can approve the use of a SDP. 4.11.3.1.2.  Crews  must  be  certified  to  use  SDPs.  The  SDP  Training  PPT  dated  11 Mar  11  (or  newer  versions)  is  the  MAJCOM’s  approved  training  material  and  is available from OGV. Upon completion of training the individual’s training folder will be appropriately annotated. 4.11.3.2.  Current  E-3  SDPs  are  retrieved  from  the  Jeppesen  AF  Ops data  website http://www.jeppesen.com/wlcs/index.jsp?section=gms&content=gms_home.jsp.  User ID and password are available from OGV upon training completion. 4.11.3.2.1.  Ad hoc requests for fields  not  currently listed may be  requested through applicable OGV NLT 72 hours prior to scheduled departure. “Ad hoc” SDPs are valid for  seven  (7)  days  after  the  analysis  date.  The  SDP  analysis  date  is  located  in  the upper left-hand corner of the takeoff performance sheet. 4.11.4.  VFR  departures  may  be  used  when  aircrews  are  unable  to  meet  or  exceed  the required IFR climb gradient, the mission justifies the increased risk, and the weather satisfies minimums  outlined  in  11-202V3  if  approved  by  MAJCOM/A3  (T-0).  VFR  departures  that do satisfy IFR climb gradient requirements still require OG/CC approval (T-3). 4.12.  Enroute Navigation. 4.12.1.  Normally plan for maximum use of E-3 navigation equipment by flying great circle routes.  Random  Area  Navigation  (RNAV)/direct  routing  may  be  flown  according  to  FLIP, General Planning. Navigators will annotate changes to the route of flight on the Navigational chart  (unless  safety  of  flight  dictates).  Revised  ETAs  will  be  computed  and  the  ETA  to significant events will be briefed to the AC and MCC. Any waypoints or patterns entered into the navigation system will be crosschecked by an additional flight crew member. 4.12.2.  The  Navigator  will  log  a  full  navigational  fix,  suitable  for  dead  reckoning,  prior  to leaving radio navigation aid coverage. Additional fixes will be logged as required to ensure safe  mission  accomplishment.  The  Navigator  will  also  perform  periodic  crosschecks  of navigation equipment, intended route, and cleared route to identify navigation errors, prevent inadvertent deviations and ensure equipment is performing within tolerances. At a minimum, these  crosschecks  will  be  performed  after  level-off,  prior  to  air  refueling,  during  orbit intercepts  and  when  assuming  on-station.  The  Navigator  will  log  the  time  and  aircraft position as part of these crosschecks.  The AC (and MCC as required) will be immediately notified of any discrepancies or malfunctions. AFI11-2E-3V3  2 MARCH 2016 27 4.12.3.  Special  Qualification  Airspace  Navigation.  Both  Required  Navigation  Performance (RNP)  Airspace  and  Reduced  Vertical  Separation  Minimum  (RVSM)  Airspace  are considered special qualification airspace. The E-3 is approved for operation in RNP airspace with  operational  limitations  based  on  GINS  navigational  equipment.  The  following  are  E-3 CNS/ATM  Certifications:  RVSM,  TCAS  II  v  7.0  (ACAS  II),  RNP-5,  BRNAV,  RNP-10, NAT MNPS (RNP-12.6), VHF-Nav FM Immunity, and 8.33 kHz VHF. Reference FLIP GP and the following guidance for RNP and RVSM requirements (T-0): 4.12.3.1.  RNP-10  compliance  includes  navigation  accuracy  within  10  NM  of  actual position 95 percent of the time. 4.12.3.1.1.  The  E-3  may  operate  in  RNP-10  airspace  without  time  limits  when “GPSonly”  or  “GPS/INS-blended”  mode  of  navigation  is  selected.  The  E-3  may operate  in  RNP-10  airspace  in  “INS-only”  mode  for  6.2  hours  from  the  time  the Embedded GPS INUs (EGIs) were commanded to the NAV mode or the last aligned, whichever is later. 4.12.3.1.2.  Updates will be IAW RNP/Basic Area Navigation (BRNAV) update and contingency procedures in this volume. 4.12.4.  BRNAV (RNAV5) Airspace. Compliance includes navigation accuracy within 5 NM of actual position 95 percent of the time.  BRNAV accuracy criteria are RNAV5. 4.12.4.1.  The E-3 may operate in BRNAV (RNAV5) airspace without time limits when “GPS-only”  or  “GPS/INS-blended”  mode  of  navigation  is  selected.  The  E-3  may  be operated  in  BRNAV/RNAV5  airspace  in  “INS-only”  mode  for  2.0  hours  from  the  time the EGIs were commanded to the NAV mode or the last aligned, whichever is later. 4.12.5.  RNP/BRNAV  Flight  Planning.  The  PIC  will  review  airspace  requirements  (i.e. specific RNP level and contingency actions, etc.) and assess mission impact when flying in RNP10/BRNAV (RNAV5) airspace (T-0). 4.12.5.1.  Enroute.  At  the  RNP/BRNAV  entry  point  both  EGIs  must  be  operational  and RAIM  must  be  ON  and  operational.  Periodic  crosschecks  of  all  available  navigation sources,  intended  route,  and  cleared  route  will  be  accomplished  to  identify  navigation errors  and  prevent  inadvertent  deviation  from  ATC  cleared  routes.  Advise  ATC  of  the deterioration  or  failure  of  navigation  equipment  below  navigation  performance requirements and coordinate appropriate actions. 4.12.6.  Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM) Airspace. Airspace where RVSM is applied is considered special qualification airspace. 4.12.6.1.  RVSM  Equipment/Operations.  Both  primary  altimeters,  the  autopilot  (to include  the  altitude  hold  function),  the  altitude  alerter  system,  and  the  IFF  transponder must be fully operational before entry into RVSM airspace (T-0). Before entering RVSM airspace advise ATC of any RVSM equipment failures and request a new clearance (T-0). 4.12.6.1.1.  Autopilot. The autopilot shall be engaged during level cruise except when circumstances such as the need to re-trim the aircraft require disengagement. 4.12.6.1.2.  Altimeters.  Altimeters  will  be  crosschecked  ever  hour  to  ensure  they agree ± 200 ft. 28 AFI11-2E-3V3  2 MARCH 2016 4.12.6.1.3.  Should  any  of  the  required  equipment  fail  after  entry  into  RVSM airspace, immediately notify ATC and coordinate a plan of action (T-0). 4.12.6.1.4.  Aircrews  should  limit  climb  and  descent  rates  to  1,000  feet  per  minute when  operating  in  the  vicinity  of  other  aircraft  to  reduce  potential  effects  on  traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS) operations. 4.12.7.  Trans-oceanic  flights.  To  minimize  trans-oceanic  gross  navigational  errors  (GNE), Navs  will  accomplish  a  coast  out/in  fix  during  trans-oceanic  flights  or  when  the  aircraft  is operating out of radio aid range. For trans-oceanic flights Navigators will compute an equal time point (ETP). Additionally, the Nav will annotate the time over an oceanic checkpoint on the Navigational chart. The aircraft heading will be crosschecked with the planned heading. The  Nav  will  annotate  the  aircraft  position  on  the  navigational  chart  approximately  10 minutes after each oceanic waypoint is passed. 4.13.  On-Station. 4.13.1.  The  CSO  will  normally  control  the  use  of  HF  1.  The  AC  will  coordinate  with  the CSO  if  the  flight  crew  requires  its  use.  The  MCC/CSO  will  coordinate  with  the  AC  if  the mission crew requires the use of either of the flight crew’s VHF or UHF radios. 4.13.2.  Pilots  and  Navigators  will  closely  monitor  the  first  complete  trip  around  the  orbit after initial intercept to ensure the aircraft is maintaining proper orbit. 4.13.3.  The  AC  has  the responsibility  and  final  authority  for  determining  when  the  aircraft should  depart  station.  ACs  will  consider  forecast  enroute  and  destination  weather,  enroute winds, icing, mission requirements, fuel requirements, training requirements, etc. 4.13.3.1.  Within 1 hour after assuming station or refueling, the flight crew will compute “bingo fuel” and report remaining station time to the MCC. If AAR is planned after orbit, make a similar computation allowing enough fuel so that in the event of a missed AAR, the  aircraft  can  land  at  the  destination  or  a  preplanned  alternate  with  the  required  fuel minimums. Bingo fuel computations will not include center wing tank fuel used as ballast to maintain center of gravity (c.g.) forward of 35% mean aerodynamic chord (MAC). 4.13.3.2.  If  fuel  requirements  necessitate  a  modification  to  on-station  duration,  pattern, or altitude, the AC will notify the MCC. 4.13.3.3.  Aircrews  will  evaluate  weather  considerations  within  1  hour  after  assuming station  and  make  periodic  weather  checks  as  necessitated  by  forecasted  or  current conditions.  This  check  may include  enroute, refueling track, landing base, and alternate base weather as required. 4.13.3.4.  Crews  should  fly  an  alternate  mission  in  lieu  of  dumping  fuel  to  adjust  gross weight should an equipment malfunction or an inability to complete an assigned mission occur.  Alternate missions should be planned and briefed during mission planning day. 4.14.  Arrival and Approach. 4.14.1.  Approach Briefing. Prior to starting descent from cruise altitude, the Pilot flying the approach  will  brief  the  crew  IAW  T.O.  1E-3A-1  and  AFMAN  11-217V1  requirements. During  an  approach,  the  AC,  CP  or  FP,  and  Nav  will  each  have  a  separate    Terminal Approach  Procedure  or  Standard  Terminal  Arrival  Route  (STAR)  booklet  available  for  use AFI11-2E-3V3  2 MARCH 2016 29 during  the  descent  briefing  and  to  reference  during  the  approach.  The  Pilot  not  flying  the approach and the Nav will monitor their respective instruments and all radio transmissions by the controlling agency, and advise the Pilot making the approach when noting any deviation from the prescribed procedures or instructions. 4.14.2.  Instrument  Approach  Advisory  Calls.  The  Pilot  monitoring  the  approach  will  make the following advisory calls: 4.14.2.1.  Non-Precision Approaches: 4.14.2.1.1.  100 feet above minimum descent altitude (MDA).  4.14.2.1.2.  “Minimums” at MDA. 4.14.2.1.3.  “Runway  in  sight.”  Make  this  call  when  the  runway  environment  is  in sight. Do not call too soon when obstructions to vision such as fog, haze, low stratus clouds, etc., are present. 4.14.2.1.4.  “Visual descent point (VDP).” 4.14.2.1.5.  “Missed Approach Point,” (MAP), if applicable. 4.14.2.2.  Precision Approaches: 4.14.2.2.1.  100 feet above decision altitude (DA). 4.14.2.2.2.  “Runway  in  sight.”  Make  this  call  when  the  runway  environment  is  in sight. Do not call too soon when obstructions to vision such as fog, haze, low stratus clouds, etc., are present. 4.14.2.2.3.  “Decision altitude.” 4.14.2.3.  The Navigator will monitor altitude and report deviations. 4.14.2.4.  The Pilot flying the aircraft will: 4.14.2.4.1.  Acknowledge all advisory calls over interphone. 4.14.2.4.2.  Announce intentions over interphone at the appropriate decision point for both  instrument  and  visual  approaches  (i.e.  “Crew  we’re  going  to  land/go-around/touch-and-go”). 4.14.3.  Priorities. Upon commencing the final approach (glideslope interception or departing the final approach fix [FAF]), flight deck crewmembers will avoid unnecessary distractions. Priorities will be monitoring the approach/landing and completing the BEFORE LANDING checklist.  All  activities  not  associated  with  the  approach/landing  checklist  accomplishment will cease. 4.15.  Simulator  Only  Maneuvers.  The  following  maneuvers  will  be  practiced  in  the  flight simulator only: 4.15.1.  Aborted takeoff. 4.15.2.  Engine failure(s) during takeoff and/or climbout to traffic pattern altitude. 4.15.3.  Two-engine operations (cruise, approach, go-around, and/or landing). 30 AFI11-2E-3V3  2 MARCH 2016 4.15.4.  Three-engine  rudder  boost  out  operations  (cruise,  approach,  go-around,  and/or landing). 4.15.5.  Initial Buffet/Stick Shaker Recovery. 4.15.6.  Unusual Attitudes. 4.15.7.  Flaps-up landing and touch and go. 4.16.  Occupancy of Flight Crew Duty Positions. 4.16.1.  ACs and FPs may perform their duties from either seat. CPs must be certified by the SQ/CC IAW local supplements in order to perform duties in the AC position during critical phases of flight and then may do so only under IP/SEFE supervision. 4.16.2.  During  non-critical  phases  of  flight,  if  the  AC  or  CP leaves  the  flight  deck,  the  FE position must be occupied by a qualified FE or be supervised by an instructor/SEFE FE. 4.16.3.  During critical phases of flight or simulated/actual emergencies, unqualified Pilots or Pilots not in training to achieve qualification in the E-3, will not occupy any flight crew duty position. Rated Pilot General/Flag officers flying under provisions of MAJCOM guidance are exempt.  Waiver authority is MAJCOM/A3. 4.17.  Midair Collision Avoidance. 4.17.1.  Man all flight deck seats below FL 180 to the maximum extent practical. Crews will maintain  an  IFR  clearance  for  separation  and  use  autopilot  whenever  practical.  The Navigator  and  Pilots  will  use  the  weather  radar  when  possible  to  search  for  traffic.  The Observer, when available, will be on headset and actively scan for traffic. 4.17.2.  Make  seat  changes  for  the  AC  or  CP  position  with  the  autopilot  and  altitude  hold engaged  if  practical.  Initiate  seat  changes  while  stabilized  in  the    IFR    traffic    pattern, extended  VFR  traffic  pattern  or  when  above  10,000  feet  MSL  during  climbs  and  descents. Emphasize clearing during the seat change. 4.17.3.  TCAS operation will be IAW AFI 11-202V3. 4.18.  Equipment on the Flight Deck.  Hold crew equipment and publications on the flight deck to  a  minimum  commensurate  with  mission  requirements.  Stowed  equipment  must  not  prevent rapid egress from the flight deck. 4.19.  In-flight  Meals.  The  AC  and  CP  should not  eat  meals  at  the  same  time  and  their  meals should consist of different menu items if prepared by the same flight kitchen or organization. 4.20.  Fuel  Requirements.  For  planning  purposes,  fuel  reserves  on  all  flights  will  be  18,000 pounds  over  the  destination  (or  alternate  when  required)  initial  approach  fix,  or  IAW  AFI  11- 202V3, whichever is greater. Fuels listed herein are minimum required fuels. The PIC may plan to  arrive overhead  with  more fuel  based on the  dynamics of the mission (e.g.  weather  enroute, airport environment, etc.). 4.20.1.  Fuel  required  at  the  initial  approach  fix  at  the  original  destination  will  allow  a penetration and one approach, then climb to optimum altitude and arrival over the alternate initial approach fix with 18,000 pounds of fuel or greater. AFI11-2E-3V3  2 MARCH 2016 31 4.20.2.  Minimum landing fuel for flights on an IFR clearance is 15,000 pounds. “Minimum Fuel” will normally be declared to the controlling agency when it is determined the aircraft may land at the intended destination with 15,000 pounds of fuel remaining or less. However, if  the  destination  airfield  is  VFR,  and  after  the  aircraft  is  established  in  the  airfield’s  radar and/or visual traffic pattern, practice approaches and landings may be conducted until 12,000 pounds of fuel remain, provided CG limits are not exceeded or weather conditions deteriorate below VFR. 4.20.3.  “Emergency  Fuel” will be declared to  the controlling agency  when it is  determined the aircraft may land at the intended destination with 10,000 pounds of fuel or less. 4.20.4.  When mission requirements dictate and when specifically approved by the applicable group  commander,  fuel  reserves  may  be  reduced  (provided  they  meet  or  exceed  AFI  11- 202V3 requirements) to the following: Initial Approach Fix-12,000 pounds, Minimum Fuel- 10,000 pounds, Emergency Fuel-8,000 pounds. the  aircraft.  When 4.21.  Aircraft  Ground  Refueling.  FEs  are  authorized refueling/defueling  aircraft  at  bases  where  E-3  maintenance  support  is  not  available,  FEs  will comply  with  T.O.  1E-3A-2-7-5CL-1,  Refueling  and  Defueling,  T.O.  00-25-172,  Ground Servicing  of  Aircraft  and  Static  Grounding/Bonding  and  T.O.  1E-3A-2-7,  Ground  Handling-Servicing and Airframe (T-3). to  refuel 4.21.1.  Anytime  adequate  portable  firefighting  equipment  is  unavailable  or  any  condition listed  under  Abnormal  Conditions,  Section  1,  T.O.  00-25-172  exists,  the  FE  will  notify  the local  fire  department.  The  fire  department  will  be  informed  of  the  abnormal  condition  and parking  spot/  location  of  aircraft.  The  FE  should  be  informed  by  the  fire  chief  of  the estimated response time or if a standby fire truck needs to be in position prior to servicing. Communication capability will be immediately available. 4.21.2.  In the event base support is limited or nonexistent, other crewmembers may be used as  refueling  team  members  at  the  discretion  of  the  AC.  The  Flight  Engineer  will  brief  all team  members  on  the  use  of  fire  equipment,  safety  precautions,  and  emergency  shutdown procedures. 4.22.  Fuel Jettisoning.  Conduct fuel dumping only to reduce gross weight in an emergency or for  operational  necessity.  When  circumstances  permit,  dump  above  5,000  feet  AGL  over unpopulated  areas  or  in  designated  fuel  dump  areas.  Advise  the  appropriate  air  traffic  control agency  of  intentions,  altitude,  and  location  when  fuel  is  jettisoned  and  when  the  operation  is complete.  Make  the  appropriate  entry  on  the  AFTO  Forms  781A/H,  Aerospace  Vehicle  Flight Status and Maintenance Document. 4.23.  Aircraft  Interior  Lighting.  During  ground/flight  operation,  it  is  recommended  to  keep flight deck lighting at the lowest practical level. During night parking, do not use the high level flight deck lighting until after the aircraft is chocked and brakes are released. This will allow the Pilots to ensure that the aircraft does not roll. 4.24.  Inflight Engine Failure.  During peacetime training missions, if an engine is shutdown in flight,  terminate  the  mission  and  land  as  soon  as  practical,  IAW  TO  1E-3A-1.  During contingency operations, if an engine is shutdown in flight, mission requirements may necessitate continuing the sortie unless safety of flight is compromised. 32 AFI11-2E-3V3  2 MARCH 2016 4.25.  Inflight  Troubleshooting.  After  flight  manual  emergency  procedures  are  complete, aircrews will not conduct in-flight troubleshooting. 4.25.1.  Cockpit  Voice  Recorder  (CVR).  If  involved  in  a  mishap  or  incident,  after  landing and terminating the emergency, pull the CVR power circuit breaker. 4.26.  Flight Control Malfunctions. 4.26.1.  The  following  procedures  will  be  adhered  to  when  maintenance  "redballs"  for primary flight control malfunctions during preflight or ground operations. The AC along with maintenance  personnel  will  evaluate  the  malfunction  and  determine  appropriate  actions necessary  to  provide  an  airworthy  aircraft.  If  the  malfunction  cannot  be  isolated  to  a particular part and repaired within a suitable amount of time, the aircraft will be returned to maintenance for repair. 4.26.2.  Inflight,  if  a  primary  flight  control  malfunction  is  experienced,  the  flight  crew  will perform the appropriate flight manual procedures, terminate the mission, and land as soon as practical, IAW T.O. 1E-3A-1. 4.27.  Divert  Charts.  Units  will  develop  divert  charts  to  cover  their  local  operating  areas  and publish them in their local chapter to this instruction. Information contained on these charts will include divert airfields, headings, distances, flight times, fuel requirements, and cruise altitudes.  Carry divert charts on all flights. 4.28.  Air-to-Air Refueling Restrictions/Procedures. 4.28.1.  AAR  Refueling  procedures  will  be  conducted  IAW  ATP  56  (B),  Air-to-Air Refueling, and national annexes. Plan to AAR with a center of gravity forward of 32% MAC. AAR can be accomplished outside of these limits  provided it is  thoroughly briefed prior to conducting AAR. 4.28.2.  For  all normal  operations, the  gross  weight  inflight  with  flaps up  will be limited to the maximum gross weight versus altitude for a 2.5G load factor IAW TO 1E-3A-1, Section 5.  Use  of  gross  weights  versus  altitude  for  a  2.0G  load  factor  require  applicable  group commander approval. 4.28.3.  Do  not  accomplish  AAR  during  training  missions  when  any  conditions  are encountered which, in the opinion of the AC or boom operator, result in marginal control of the aircraft or the boom. 4.28.4.  Do not accomplish AAR if any primary flight control malfunctions are encountered or with the series yaw damper inoperative. 4.28.5.  Do  not  accomplish  AAR  without  tanker  disconnect  capability,  to  include  manual boom latching, unless an actual fuel emergency or operational necessity exists. 4.28.6.  Boom Envelope Demonstrations will be conducted under IP/SEFE supervision. The boom  operator  will  initiate  and  ensure  disconnect  capability  before  demonstrating  limits IAW ATP-56(B). 4.28.7.  Non-AAR  qualified  FPs  are  authorized  to  fly  the  aircraft  up  to  and  including precontact from either the right or left seat with an AC in the other seat, but must not close to the contact position unless under IP/SEFE supervision. AAR qualified FPs are authorized to fly  the  aircraft  up  to  and  including  contact  from  either  the  left  or  right  seat  with  an AFI11-2E-3V3  2 MARCH 2016 33 experienced AC in the other seat.  Non-AAR qualified CPs are authorized to fly the aircraft up  to  and  including  precontact  from  the  right  seat  with  an  AC  in  the  left  seat,  but  will  not close inside precontact unless under the supervision of an IP/SEFE. AAR qualified CPs are authorized  to  fly  the  aircraft  up  to  and  including  contact  from  the  right  seat  with  an experienced AC in the left seat. CP AAR from the left seat will be conducted under IP/SEFE supervision. 4.28.8.  ACs/CPs  undergoing  initial  qualification  or  upgrade  training  may  conduct  a rendezvous up to 1 NM from the tanker without IP/SEFE supervision. 4.28.9.  To  allow  time  to  establish  communications  with  ATC,  discontinue  air  refueling  at least 3 minutes prior to the end of track and descend to the bottom of the block. 4.28.10.  Loss of Radio Contact. If contact is not established or is lost between tanker and the E-3 on the allocated AAR frequency, follow “Loss of Radio Contact” guidance  IAW ATP- 56(B). 4.29.  Post AAR Procedures.  Use the following procedures after completion of air refueling to achieve safe separation from the tanker: 4.29.1.  The receiver Pilot will maintain stabilized in the contact position while asking for or initiating a disconnect and will remain stabilized until confirming either visually or verbally that the boom is clear. 4.29.2.  After confirmation that the boom is clear, the receiver Pilot will begin to move aft to the pre-contact position.  Once this separation has been attained, the receiver Pilot will begin a  slow  descent  at  approximately  500  to  1,000  feet  per  minute  (fpm)  and  establish  a  power setting  that  will  ensure  increased  vertical  separation  and  avoid  under-running  the  tanker during descent. 4.29.3.  The  Pilot  will  establish  a  minimum  of  1,000  feet  vertical  separation  between  the receiver  and  the  tanker.  Do  not  make  any  turns  from  the  established  air  refueling  heading during the descent phase. 4.29.3.1.  Establish  1,000  feet  vertical  separation  and  engage  autopilot  (if  available) before initiating the post-air refueling checklist.  Slipway doors may be closed to reduce cockpit  noise  levels.  The  autopilot  circuit  breaker  may  be  reset  if  opened  prior  to  air refueling. 4.29.3.2.  To  ensure  safe  separation  during  the  separation  maneuver,  the  Pilot  not  in control of the airplane and the Navigator will monitor the positions of all tankers in the formation by whatever means possible (visual, weather radar, air-to-air TACAN, etc.). 4.29.3.3.  If the receiver cannot descend to establish the required vertical  separation, the receiver will move back to the precontact position and request the tanker initiate a climb to obtain a minimum of 1,000 feet vertical separation. 4.30.  Formation Restrictions.  The enroute cell and air refueling formations described in ATP-56(B) are the only authorized formations. Crews will only fly these formations when specifically tasked, using the procedures published in the appropriate tech orders. 34 AFI11-2E-3V3  2 MARCH 2016 4.31.  Abnormal  Configurations.  Do  not  fly  missions  with  known  abnormal  configurations unless approved by the applicable group commander. Abnormal configurations can include a six or seven brake only operation, partial spoilers, inoperative antiskid, etc. 4.32.  Three-Engine Ferry Flights.  Do not conduct three engine ferry flights unless specifically approved by applicable MAJCOM/A3. AFI11-2E-3V3  2 MARCH 2016 35 Chapter 5 MISSION CREW OPERATING PROCEDURES 5.1.  E-3 Missions. 5.1.1.  E-3 Tactical Mission: 5.1.1.1.  The  E-3  is  a  primary  airborne  element  of  the  Theater  Air  Control  System (TACS). Specific mission taskings will be determined by the Joint Force Air Component Commander (JFACC).  The E-3 may be responsible for: 5.1.1.1.1.  Surveillance within its assigned area of responsibility (AOR). 5.1.1.1.2.  Detecting  and  assessing  potential  threats  and  passing  threat  calls  to affected aircraft under E-3 control or to appropriate TACS agencies 5.1.1.1.3.  Transmitting  accurate  and  timely  surveillance  data  to  the  CRC/Air Operations  Center  (AOC)  and  crosstell  appropriate  surveillance  data  to  adjacent command and control facilities. 5.1.1.1.4.  Identification  of  traffic  in  areas  without  existing  ground  identification authority  or  when  ground  identification  facilities  are  degraded  and  not  capable  of providing the identification function. 5.1.1.1.5.  Issuing  of  scramble  orders  or  airborne  orders  in  the  absence  of  ground tactical air control system (GTACS) or when authority is delegated by the AOC. 5.1.1.1.6.

When the primary or alternate AOC is inoperative, the JFACC may direct an E-3 to continue to manage tactical air operations until the AOC becomes operational. Under this condition, additional E-3 responsibilities may include voice coordination with Army, Navy, Allied units, and Air Support Operations Centers (ASOCs). 5.1.2.  E-3  North  American  Aerospace  Defense  Command  (NORAD)  Missions.  The NORAD  strategic  air  defense  mission  covers  three  roles:  air  sovereignty,  tactical  warning, and  atmospheric  defense.  Air  sovereignty  is  the  peacetime  policing  of  the  combined US/Canadian  sovereign  airspaces  to  ensure  that  all  air  traffic  using  the  airspace  complies with  national  regulations.  The  second  role  of  tactical  warning  includes  detecting, characterizing,  and  assessing  potential  threats.    The  third  role  is  the  wartime  role  of 36 AFI11-2E-3V3  2 MARCH 2016 atmospheric air defense against an enemy threat or attack. NORAD performs these roles by integrating a variety of sensor equipment, communications, aircraft, and facilities. 5.1.3.  E-3  Counter  Narcotics  Terrorism.  The  E-3  counterdrug  (CD)  mission  is  to  assist national agencies in interdiction of suspected drug traffic IAW command directives. 5.1.4.  Joint Tactical Air Operations (JTAO). Integration and coordination among all C2 units deployed  to  a  particular  theater  is  paramount  for  effective  JTAO  operations.  JTAO operations are defined in the JTAO Procedural Handbook. E-3 crews must be fully trained to execute the Air Tasking Order (ATO), Airspace Control Order (ACO), and Operation Task Link (OPTASKLINK) in a joint environment to ensure proper force management and control of  weapons  systems.  The  entire  system  is  dependent  upon  the  effective  use  and  control  of data links. E-3 crews must understand their role within the joint data network and how their data  can  both  aid  and  hamper  JTAO.  CJCSM  3115.01A,  Joint  Data  Network  Operations, outlines the duties of the Joint Information  Coordination  Center (JICC)  and how the multi-link network is to be administered. E-3 crews will operate data link equipment IAW CJCSM 6120.01C,  Joint  Multi-Tactical  Data  Link  (TDL)  Operating  Procedures,  and  the  written guidance  of  the  Joint  Interface  Control  Officer  (JICO)  (i.e.  OPTASKLINK,  OPTASK  ID Sup, and Tactical Operation Data (TACOPDAT)). During missions, the crew will adhere to the  directions  of  the  joint,  regional,  or  sector  interface  control  officers  (J/R/SICO). Coordination  will  be  performed  on  the  assigned  interface  control  net  (ICN)/data  link coordination  net  (DCN)  and  track  supervision  nets  (TSN).  All  E-3  crewmembers participating  on  these  nets  must  be  familiar  with  directed  net  procedures  and  follow  the directions of the net control station (NECOS). 5.2.

Coordinate with the ASO on radar operating parameters (i.e. dedicated time test azimuth, second-time-around-thresholds, etc.), and on detection, analysis, and response to EA. 5.3.  Operational Procedures. AFI11-2E-3V3  2 MARCH 2016 43 5.3.1.  Aircraft  Mission  Systems  History  Log  Book.  Maintain  a  history  log  book  for  each aircraft.  Units  will  develop  history  log  book  procedures  and  ensure  log  books  are  readily available.  Technicians will review the log book during preflight. 5.3.2.  Equipment  Malfunctions.  The  MCC,  after  coordination  with  the  AC  on  equipment issues  which  affect  aircraft  systems,  must  approve  continued  operations  of  malfunctioning mission equipment that would affect the mission. The MCC will evaluate the impact of using degraded equipment against the mission tasking and the inability to meet that tasking. 5.3.3.  Air Surveillance Procedures: 5.3.3.1.  Coordination. The ASO will coordinate with the SD, ECO, and MCC to ensure all  activity  is  conducted  on  an  appropriate  map.  Coordinate  Command  and  Control Coordinate System (CCCS) origin changes with the MCC, CDMT/ST and ECO prior to taking the switch action. 5.3.3.2.  Briefings.  The  ASO/SST  will  accomplish  a  surveillance  briefing  on  mission planning  day  that  will  cover  surveillance  information  and  contracts  applicable  to  the entire  mission  and/or  flight  crew.  The  ASO  will  also  accomplish  a  surveillance specialized  briefing  prior  to  assuming  station.  As  a  minimum,  this  briefing  will  include surveillance  areas  not  covered  in  previous  briefings  and  any  areas  needing  extra emphasis,  such  as  individual  taskings,  surveillance  contracts,  ROE,  symbology  and tracking, identification plan, and contingency/emergency duties. 5.3.3.3.  Sensor  Management/Procedures.  Prior  to  assuming  station,  the  ASO  will perform sensor checks to determine the optimum radar/IFF settings for the mission.  The ASO  will  brief  the  MCC  on  the  results  of  the  checks  and  the  final  radar  setup.   Sensor check procedures include: 5.3.3.3.1.  IFF Sensor Check. Perform a systematic checkout of the IFF, to include all operational  Receiver/Transmitters  (R/T)s  as  soon  as  it  becomes  available.  If equipment malfunctions, the ASO will accomplish an additional check once the unit is back on line. If a previously unchecked R/T unit comes on line, the ASO will again accomplish an additional check. As a minimum, the ASO will check: 5.3.3.3.1.1.  Mode IV Test. Perform a mode IV loop test prior to declaring the IFF operational. 5.3.3.3.1.2.  Maximum  Range.  Measure  the  maximum  range  of  the  IFF  by determining the range of an IFF sensor return with a consistent (three out of seven returns) data trail. 5.3.3.3.1.3.  IFF  Jitter.  Check  in  all  quadrants,  as  close  as  possible  to,  but  not beyond, 250 NM from the E-3. Measure jitter as sideways displacement of returns from a straight-line path. Normally jitter up to 3 NM is acceptable. 5.3.3.3.1.4.  Quality.  The  overall  quality  of  the  IFF  will  be  determined  by checking  consistency  of  data  trails,  and  when  radar  becomes  available,  the mileage  difference  between  the  IFF  and  radar  sensor  returns.  Normally,  returns within 2 NM are acceptable. Accomplish this check within a radius of 250 miles from the E-3. 5.3.3.3.1.5.  Resolution of IFF Overloads. The ASO will monitor IFF counts and 44 AFI11-2E-3V3  2 MARCH 2016 make necessary adjustments to resolve overload conditions and minimize the loss of IFF data. 5.3.3.3.2.  Radar  Sensor  Check.  Time  permitting,  the  ASO  will  check  as  many  RF sets  as  possible,  and  select  a  primary  and  secondary  RF  set  (preferably  not  in  the same chain). The ASO will use identical radar tabular display settings for each RF set checked  for  accurate  comparison.  Radar  mode  will  include  both  the  Doppler  and Beyond  The  Horizon  (BTH)  radars.  A  sensor  quality  check  must  be  made  when established in the orbit area if a checkout was made prior to arrival to the orbit area. The radar check will include: 5.3.3.3.2.1.  Doppler/BTH  Maximum  Range.  Determine  the  maximum  Doppler range  from  the  situation  indicator  display  presentation  using  data  trails  with  a minimum 40% blip-scan ratio (3 out of 7 scans have radar returns). A single data point,  present  or  history,  may  be  used  to  determine  the  maximum  BTH  range from the situation indicator display presentation. 5.3.3.3.2.2.  Quality.  Radar  quality  is  determined  by  the  percentage  of  all  IFF returns within a 250 NM radius of the E-3 that have consistent discernible radar data trails. In addition, consider the overall consistency of the radar presentation. Use the following criteria to assess the overall quality of the radar: 5.3.3.3.2.2.1.  Good. Greater than 75%. 5.3.3.3.2.2.2.  Fair.  Between 50 to 75%. 5.3.3.3.2.2.3.  Poor.  Less than 50%. 5.3.3.3.2.3.  System  Counts.  On  applicable  form,  log  the  Doppler,  BTH,  and Mode  3  counts  for  comparison  of  radar  frequencies.  Time  of  day,  operating location,  traffic  density  areas,  and  radar  mode  of  operation  may  significantly affect the ratio of these figures. 5.3.3.3.2.4.  Quality  Control/Systems  Check  Out.  Once  the  sensors  have  been initially  checked  and  declared  operational,  the  ASO  is  not  required  to  re-accomplish  a  full  sensor  check  unless  the  applicable  sensor  system  is  powered down or if the ART accomplishes a Fault Isolation Test (FIT) on the radar system, i.e. after Quality Control (QC). In circumstances such as post-AAR where sensors are transferred but  not  powered down, the ASO  will, at  minimum,  accomplish  a quality check of radar and IFF systems prior to declaring them operational. 5.3.3.3.3.  Radar  Setup.  The  ASO  must  consider  the  effects  of  the  E-3  flight parameters  on  sensor  performance  and  attempt  to  optimize  checkout  within  these constraints. The assessment of overall air picture quality will be the primary factor in determining the optimum RF set. 5.3.3.3.3.1.  After  selecting  the  optimum  RF  set,  the  ASO  will  declare  the  radar operational. 5.3.3.3.3.2.  When multiple E-3 flights  operate in an area, the ASO will perform frequency deconfliction as required. AFI11-2E-3V3  2 MARCH 2016 45 5.3.3.4.  Data Link Procedures and Operation. Data link is the primary means of passing E-3 information. Establish data links according to, Joint Multi-Tactical Data Link (TDL) Operating Procedures, for the JTIDS Network Library for JTIDS and TADIL A during Continental United States (CONUS) operations. Establish data link operations outside the CONUS according to local theater directives and the OPTASKLINK. 5.3.3.5.  Assuming  Station.  ASO  will  inform  MCC  of  station  assumption  requirements not yet completed: 5.3.3.5.1.  Conduct data base checks as appropriate. 5.3.3.5.2.  IFF configured for mission use. 5.3.3.5.3.  Configure the  radar settings and optimize sensors for maximum detection while maintaining air-picture quality. 5.3.3.5.4.  Track initiation on all data trails within the assigned AOR(s). 5.3.3.5.5.  Initiate contact with ground control agencies. 5.3.3.5.6.  Operational data link(s). 5.3.3.5.7.  PDS Download. The ASO is permitted to download PDS when an ECO is not  on-board  for  the  purpose  of  internal  crew  PDS  displays  training.  Only  an  ECO will declare PDS operational. (Note: Without an ECO on-board PDS will not be used for such purposes as signal of interest location, coordination and reporting, electronic identification, and threat warning. 5.3.3.6.  Voice Tell and Recording Procedures. When the E-3 is in an environment with units  not  capable  of  data  link  interface,  use  the  following  voice  tell  and  recording procedures: 5.3.3.6.1.  The  E-3  will  voice  tell  priority  one,  two,  and  three  tracks  unless  the receiving  agency  directs  cease  tell.  Tell  all  other  priorities  on  request  only.  For  this purpose, the following priorities have been established: 5.3.3.6.1.1.  Priority One.  Hostile/Faker.  5.3.3.6.1.2.  Priority Two.  Unknown/Pending. 5.3.3.6.1.3.  Priority Three.  Emergencies. 5.3.3.6.1.4.  Priority Four.  Defensive Counter Air. 5.3.3.6.1.5.  Priority Five. VIP Flights. 5.3.3.6.1.6.  Priority Six. Special Missions. 5.3.3.6.1.7.  Priority Seven.  Other tracks as directed by the receiving agency, (for example, Neutralized Fakers).  Live tracks have priority over simulated tracks. 5.3.3.6.2.  Voice tell will be in a format agreed upon by both agencies. 5.3.3.7.  Electronic  Combat  Procedures.  The  ASO  will  monitor/coordinate  EP  actions. Use the following procedures: 5.3.3.7.1.  The ASO, ECO and ART will coordinate on any unusual sensor activity to determine whether the source is external or internal and type of interface if able. If no 46 AFI11-2E-3V3  2 MARCH 2016 explanation  can  be  determined  and  the  source  is  external,  submit  an  Air  Force Spectrum Interference Reporting System (AFSIRS) report. 5.3.3.7.2.  Make  every  effort  in  an  EA  environment  to  obtain  active  data  on  all  EA targets.  Whenever  possible,  use  cooperative  passive  tracking.  If  cooperative  support is not available, use self-passive tracking. 5.3.3.7.3.  When  self-triangulating,  to  determine  if  one  of  several  previously  active tracking  returns  is  a  suspected  EA  emitter,  the  AST  will  extrapolate  the  suspected track on its last known heading, speed and altitude, before initiating a passive track. If two tracks are used, the ASO will coordinate with the MCC and SD to ensure proper weapons commitment. 5.3.3.7.4.  The ASO will keep the MCC and SD advised on status of passive tracks. When  the  ASO  is  confident  that  the  passive  track  has  correlated  with  the  jammer’s location, notify the SD that the track has “stabilized” and enable display to weapons consoles. In the event of burn-through, the ASO, in coordination with the MCC and IAW ROE, may  “validate” the track as  a jammer and associate the symbology with active data. 5.3.3.8.  Identification. The theater SPINS/ROE will dictate which systems/platforms can complete the ID matrix. Some platforms can fulfill the ID matrix based on their organic capability  or  based  on  their  integration  capability  (voice  or  data  link)  with  other  ID-capable  platforms.  If  the  E-3  can  fulfill  the  ID  matrix  and  has  the  ability  to  declare  a contact  hostile,  any  Air  Battle  Manager  (AWO/SD/ASO/ECO/MCC)  on  board  the  E-3 can  complete  the  ID  matrix.  The  MCC  may  restrict  this  and  retain  hostile  declaration authority or delegate it to the ABM/section leads as mission needs dictate. 5.3.4.  Weapons Procedures: 5.3.4.1.  Station Assumption.  Prior to assuming station for weapons activity, the SD will: 5.3.4.1.1.  IAW LOA or when operating as a MRU or ARU, contact FAA/Air Route Traffic  Control  Center  or  ground  monitor/control  authority  and  complete  a  sensor correlation check as required. 5.3.4.1.2.  Check all weapons assigned radio frequencies for usability. 5.3.4.1.3.  Check data base accuracy. 5.3.4.2.  On-Station  Procedures.  Procedures  will  be  according  to  the  operational procedures contained in this instruction and specific mission directives. 5.3.4.3.  Off-Station  Procedures.  The  SD  will  compile  controlled  aircraft  mission  totals and  furnish  this  data  to  the  MCC.  The  SD  will  pass  totals  to  the  ground  monitor  if requested/directed. 5.3.4.4.  SD  Control  Procedures.  The  SD  may  control  aircraft  during  a  mission  after coordination with the MCC and when simultaneous missions are not in progress. 5.3.4.5.  Handoff  Procedures.  Handoff  procedures  IAW  applicable  FAA  Letters  of Agreement.  The  SD  or  a  designated  AWO  will  monitor  the  handoff  frequency  once performing station assumption duties until termination of aircraft control. AFI11-2E-3V3  2 MARCH 2016 47 5.3.4.6.  Controlled  Aircraft  Emergency  Procedures.  For  aircraft  with in-flight emergencies, the SD/AWO performing the handoff will use the word “Emergency” at the beginning  and  ending  of  transmissions  to  the  recovery  agency.  In  the  event  of  an emergency being declared by  an aircraft under E-3 control, the AWO will refer to  their Aircrew Aids, “Controlled Aircraft Emergency Procedures.” 5.3.4.7.  Control Procedures. On-station control procedures will be IAW AFI 11-214, Air Operations and Procedures. 5.3.4.8.  Airspace.  Use  of  airspace  will  be  IAW  FAA  JO  7610.4R,  Special  Operations and appropriate Letters of Agreement. 5.3.4.9.  Distressed  Aircraft.  Report  any  suspected  or  triangular  distress  patterns  to  the SD. 5.3.4.10.  Symbology.  During  all  operations,  AWOs  will  ensure  symbology  and  sensor data of controlled aircraft  are within 2 NM of  each other. Weapons pairings to Combat Air  Patrol  (CAP),  air-to-air  intercept,  and  ground  targets  should  be  accomplished  as briefed IAW mission TDL employment. 5.3.5.  Communications Procedures: 5.3.5.1.  Radio  Procedures.  Adhere  to  communications  discipline  at  all  times.  All crewmembers will use proper International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) phrases, phonetic  alphabet,  R/T  procedures  outlined  in  ACP  121,  US  Sup  2  (Communications Instructions,  General-Air-Ground),  AFTTP  3-1  General  Planning,  and  AFTTP  3-2.5 Multi-Service Brevity Codes. 5.3.5.2.  Phone  Patches.  Units  will  establish  phone  patch  procedures  in  their  local chapter. 5.3.5.3.  Call Signs. Always use the aircraft callsign when transmitting messages of Flight Safety,  aircraft  movement,  and  radio  calls  required  by  this  instruction.  Mission crewmembers  will  use  the  mission  crew  call  sign  when  communicating  with  the respective  controlling  or  monitoring  agency,  aircraft  under  their  control,  or  as fragged/briefed.  The  CSO  will  brief  crewmembers  on  call  signs  to  use  when  providing alternate communications. 5.3.5.4.  UHF/VHF  Guard  Monitoring  Procedures.  The  MCC  will  ensure  the  mission crew monitors VHF and UHF guard frequencies. The MCC, SD, ECO, and AWOs will have UHF guard receive/transmit programmed to their consoles. While aircraft are under control by the mission crew, the SD will designate at least one weapons crewmember to monitor  UHF  guard.  The  ASO,  SST,  and  ASTs  will  have  VHF  guard  programmed  to their consoles. The ASO will designate at least one surveillance crewmember to monitor VHF guard while the E-3 is on station. 5.3.6.  Mission Crew Intercom Procedures: 5.3.6.1.  The  primary  means  of  coordination  for  the  mission  crew  will  be  via  the programmed mission nets. 5.3.6.1.1.  Coordinate net assignments/deviations through the MCC. 5.3.6.1.2.  Maintain strict net discipline.  Limit conversation to operational matters. 48 AFI11-2E-3V3  2 MARCH 2016 5.3.6.2.  Use  the  ADS  selective  intercom  system  for  information  that  is  unclassified, lengthy in nature, and/or person-to-person conversations. 5.3.6.3.  The  PA  system  is  for  use  in  emergencies  and  practice  emergencies.  Except  for emergency checklist items, use of the PA by mission crew is restricted to the MCC. 5.3.7.  Special Interest Track Procedures: 5.3.7.1.  A special interest track is any track that requires priority handling by the mission crew. 5.3.7.2.  The E-3 will not depart orbit or working area to continue monitoring the special interest  track unless directed by the command authority exercising E-3 Tactical  Control (TACON). Any instructions that are directive for the E-3 (i.e., leave/move orbit, changes in level of decentralization, etc.) will be authenticated by the MCC/NCCM. 5.3.7.3.  The MCC will: 5.3.7.3.1.  Ensure  the  ASO  assigns  tracking  responsibilities  for  the  special  interest track. 5.3.7.3.2.  Ensure  the  SD  monitors  the  special  interest  track  for  possible  intercept actions. 5.3.7.3.3.  Coordinate  with  the  ASO  and  flight  crew  to  maintain  the  special  interest track within the E-3 surveillance limits (orbit location). 5.3.7.3.4.  Coordinate  E-3  airspace  changes  (orbit  location)  with  the  flight  crew,  as required. 5.3.7.3.5.  Ensure  the  ECO  monitors  the  special  interest  track  for  possible  ID correlation. 5.3.7.3.6.  Coordinate  special  interest  track  procedures  with  Higher  Headquarters (HHQ) as required. 5.3.7.4.  The ASO will: 5.3.7.4.1.  Give priority attention to the special interest track and assign it to an AST as a specific responsibility. 5.3.7.4.2.  Ensure  the  AST  places  the  track  in  debriefing  status,  logs  the  time,  track number, and ID on the appropriate forms. 5.3.7.5.  The SD will: 5.3.7.5.1.  Monitor the progress of the special interest track and conduct  any tactical action on the track as directed. 5.3.7.5.2.  Scramble and/or direct aircraft for intercept as directed/necessary. 5.3.7.5.3.  After  the  accomplishment  of  the  intercept,  inform  the  MCC/ground monitor facility of any required information. 5.3.7.5.4.  Coordinate with the proper ground unit for recovery of the interceptors. 5.3.7.6.  The ECO will: AFI11-2E-3V3  2 MARCH 2016 49 5.3.7.6.1.  Monitor  the  special  interest  track  and  make  every  effort  to  correlate  all electronic signals emanating from the track. 5.3.7.6.2.  Log and/or hard copy, if available, all Augmented Report tabular displays (TDs) for emitters correlated to the track.  5.3.7.6.3.  If  an  ID  can  be  derived  from  the  correlated  emitters  this  information  will be passed to the ASO, SD, and MCC. 5.3.8.  Sensor Correlation: 5.3.8.1.  If control of aircraft is anticipated, accomplish a sensor correlation check prior to assuming station if required by LOA or as specified in FAA Order JO 7610.4R,  Special Military  Operations,  if  acting  as  a  Military  Radar  Unit  (MRU).  If  the  E-3  mission  is surveillance  only,  the  surveillance  section  will  perform  the  check  with  the  appropriate automated/manual tell agency(ies). 5.3.8.2.  Perform an IFF-only correlation check if: 5.3.8.2.1.  The ASO subsequently correlates IFF to radar sensor returns. 5.3.8.2.2.  IFF only on-station operations are authorized according to this instruction and  theater  operating  instructions  IAW  FAA  Order  JO  7610.4R  or  ATC  Letters  of Agreement. 5.3.8.3.  Coordinate procedures with the responsible MRU prior to assuming station when operating as an Airborne Radar Unit (ARU). 5.3.8.4.  When operating in Canada, the E-3 will comply with the DOT/DND agreement (short  title,  “AWACS  Agreement”)  between  Director  General  Air  Doctrine  and Operations Department National Defense, and Director Air Traffic Services Department of Transportation. 5.3.8.5.  The  following  procedures  apply  to  sensor  correlation  checks  required  by surveillance: 5.3.8.5.1.  Minimum  of  two  tracks  within  the  Air  Defense  Identification  Zone (ADIZ), preferably in a non-congested area. 5.3.8.5.2.  Voice tell  format will include the track number, coordinates, and Mode 3 squawk  (if  possible).  Tracks  used  must  be  within  3  NM  or  less  to  be  considered  a good sensor correlation. 5.3.8.5.3.  Successful data link correlation checks could be used instead of voice tell checks due to accurate real-time data being passed between both agencies. 5.3.9.  Electronic Support Procedures. 5.3.9.1.  Coordination.  The  ECO  will  coordinate  with  the  MCC,  ASO,  SD,  CDMT/ST, DOW, and Electronic Support Team (EST) to ensure PDS is loaded with an appropriate database.  The  ECO  will  also  coordinate  with  the  MCC  when  PDS  is  downloaded,  and operational.  In  addition  the  ECO  will  advise  the  MCC,  CDMT/ST  and/or  ASO  of  any system degradation(s). 50 AFI11-2E-3V3  2 MARCH 2016 5.3.9.2.  Sensor  Management  Procedures.  Prior  to  assuming  station,  the  ECO  will perform checks on PDS to ensure operational status and determine optimal sensor set-up. The ECO will brief the MCC on the results of these checks. 5.3.9.2.1.  PDS.  At a minimum, the ECO will check: in  Frequency  Range.  Check 5.3.9.2.1.1.  Reception to  ensure  360-degree reception  of  signals  within  all  three  bands:  low,  medium  and  high.  This  is  a subjective  check,  but  there  should  be  several  indications  within  each  band  on different azimuths. 5.3.9.2.1.2.  Triangulation. Triangulation of a known emitter (like ATC radar at a civil  airport) is  conducted. Once the active emitter file reaches “monitor  status,” check  the  location  of  the  triangulated  site  against  the  location  of  the  known emitter. 5.3.9.2.1.3.  Overload Management (30/35 only). Evaluate any reported overloads and  correct  as  necessary.  Overload  conditions  that  cannot  be  resolved  might indicate interference  and  should  be  corrected  IAW  established procedures. internal 5.3.9.3.  Data Link Procedures. The ECO should coordinate with the ASO/SST to ensure PDS  data  link  filters  are  set  correctly.  The  ECO  will  coordinate  with  the  SIGINT  ID Authority (SIA) for selecting specific emitters to tell out during the mission. 5.3.9.4.  Reporting Procedures. Reporting procedures will be IAW theater directives and AFTTP 3-1.AWACS.  JOHN W.

AFI11-2E-3V3  2 MARCH 2016 VFR—Visual Flight Rules VHF—Very High Frequency VIP—Very Important Person Terms Aircrew—Use  this  term  to  describe  the  complete  complement  of  personnel  required  to  fly  an operational mission.  It composes both the flight crew and the mission crew. Critical Phases of Flight—Critical phases of flight are takeoff, air to air refueling, flight below 5,000  feet  AGL,  approach,  landing,  and  any  other  maneuver  listed  in  this  instruction  requiring IP/SEFE supervision. Flight Crew—The flight crew is responsible for the safe ground and flight operations of the E-3 aircraft.  It  consists  of  an  AC,  FP  or  CP,  Nav,  and  FE.  For  purposes  of  this  instruction,  Flight Crew  Training  (FCT)  personnel  are  considered  flight  crew  members;  however,  contractor personnel will not occupy primary E-3 crew positions during critical phases of flight. Group  Commander—For  sorties  under  AFRC  OPCON,  the  970th  Airborne  Air  Control Squadron  Operations  and  Training  (O  and  T)  officer  (or  designated  representative)  acts  as  the applicable group commander. (SEFE)  Supervision—Instructor/Standardization  Evaluation  Flight  Examiner Instructor/SEFE  supervision  requires  an  instructor/SEFE  who  is  qualified  and  current  in  the position  and  the  maneuver  that  will  be  performed.  Individuals  not  qualified  or  current  in  the aircraft,  require  instructor/SEFE  supervision  for  the  activity  in  which  they  are  unqualified  or noncurrent. For unqualified or noncurrent Pilots, IP/SEFE supervision requires the IP/SEFE to be in  one  of  the  Pilots’  seats  with  immediate  access  to  the  controls  while  the  maneuver  is  being performed.  For  all  other  crewmembers,  instructor/SEFE  supervision  requires  over-the-shoulder observation  of  the  unqualified/non-current  crewmember.  During  critical  phases  of  flight,  flight crew instructors/SEFEs are allowed to stand, all others will be at the discretion of the PIC. Mission  Crew—The  mission  crew  consists  of  those  individuals  responsible  for  the  command, control,  surveillance,  communications/electronic,  and  management  functions,  to  include  the control  and  monitoring  of  assigned  aircraft,  sensor  management,  internal  and  external communications  management  for  mission  operations,  and  onboard  systems  maintenance.  It consists  of  the  Mission  Crew  Commander  (MCC),  Senior  Director  (SD),  Air  Weapons  Officer (AWO), Air Surveillance Officer (ASO), Electronic Combat Officer (ECO), Senior Surveillance Technician  (SST),  Air  Surveillance  Technician(s)  (AST),  Computer  Display  Maintenance Technician (ART), (ST),  Airborne  Radar  Technician Communications Systems Operator (CSO), and the Communications Technician (CT). (CDMT)/Systems  Technician Mission End Time (MET)—(AFRC only) The scheduled day and time a flight crew is planned to  return  to  home  station  from  an  exercise  or  deployment.  The  MET  will  be  published  in  the monthly Operations Plan, rotation schedule, flying schedule, and/or OPORD, as necessary. The MET is the baseline for computing Scheduled Return Time. Mission  Essential  Ground  Personnel—Individual who perform unique support duties directly related and essential to the particular aircraft or mission being flown. The OG/CC (or equivalent) with operational control of the aircraft being flown grants MEGP status. AFI11-2E-3V3  2 MARCH 2016 59 NORAD Battle Staff—The battle staff assists the crew performing aerial operations within the NORAD area of operations (AO). The battle staff is responsible for managing the air battle and carrying out the required command and control functions. It has the responsibility and authority, as directed by the appropriate commander, to ensure the most effective use of assigned resources to accomplish the mission. The NORAD Certified Crewmember (NCCM) is an ACC/PACAF E-3 crewmember specifically trained to support the NORAD mission. Supported commanders may also provide a NORAD Airborne Battle Commander (NABC) and NORAD Weapons Resource Officer  (NWRO).  PACAF/AFRC  E-3  crewmembers  will  be  trained  and  certified  by  local procedures using a command approved syllabus. Operational Control (OPCON)—Command authority that may be exercised by commanders at any  echelon  at  or  below  the  level  of  combatant  command  and  may  be  delegated  within  the command.  OPCON  is  the  authority  to  perform  those  functions  of  command  over  subordinate forces  involving  organizing  and  employing  commands  and  forces,  assigning  tasks,  designating objectives,  and  giving  authoritative  direction  necessary  to  accomplish  the  mission.  Operational control includes authoritative direction over all aspects of military operations and joint training necessary to accomplish the mission.  It should be delegated to and exercised by the commanders of  subordinate  organizations;  normally,  this  authority  is  exercised  through  subordinate  Joint Forces  Commanders  (JFCs),  Service,  and/or  functional  component  commanders.    OPCON provides  authority  to  organize  and  employ  commands  and  forces  as  the  commander  considers necessary  to  accomplish  assigned  missions;  it  does  not  include  authoritative  direction  for logistics  or  matters  of  administration,  discipline,  internal  organization,  or  unit  training.    These elements  of  combatant  command  must  be  specifically  delegated  by  the  combatant  commander.  OPCON does include the authority to delineate functional responsibilities and operational areas of subordinate JFCs. Squadron  Aviation  Resource  Management  (SARM)—The  office  responsible  for,  but  not limited to publishing flight crew orders, flight and mission crew kits, and tracking the squadron’s aircraft locations. Scheduled Return Time (SRT)—(AFRC only) A force management tool used by the on-scene commander  to  assure  return  of  the  Reserve  associate  personnel  to  home  station  before  the expiration of their active duty orders. The SRT is calculated MET plus 24 hours. Tactical  Control  (TACON)—An  authority  over  assigned  or  attached  forces  or  commands,  or military capability  or  forces made available  for tasking, that is  limited to the detailed direction and  control  of  movements  or  maneuvers  within  the  operational  area  necessary  to  accomplish assigned  missions  or  tasks  assigned  by  the  commander  exercising  OPCON  or  TACON  of  the attached force. TACON is able to be delegated from a lesser authority than OPCON and may be delegated  to  and  exercised  by  commanders  at  any  echelon  at  or  below  the  level  of  combatant command.  TACON  provides  authority  to  give  direction  for  military  operations  and  to  control designated forces. TACON does not provide the authority to give or change the function of the subordinate commander.  TACON provides sufficient authority for controlling and directing the application of force or tactical use of combat support assets within the assigned mission or task.  TACON  does  not  provide  organizational  authority  or  authoritative  direction  for  administrative and  logistic  support.    Functional  component  commanders  typically  exercise  TACON  over military capability of forces made available for tasking. 60 AFI11-2E-3V3  2 MARCH 2016 Transition—Practice  multiple  takeoffs,  simulated  emergency  patterns,  low  approaches    and touch  and  go  landings.  Transition  timing  begins  when  the  aircraft  crosses  the  threshold  on  the first approach. Wing  Commander—For  sorties  under  AFRC  OPCON  the  513th  ACG  Commander  (or designated representative) acts as the WG/CC.  AFI11-2E-3V3  2 MARCH 2016 61 Attachment 2 E-3 BAGGAGE AND EQUIPMENT LOADING A2.1.  Flight Engineer Responsibilities: A2.1.1.  Verify an AFTO Form 781A entry was made when On-Board Spare (OBS) kits are loaded. A2.1.2.  Ensure the removal of the forward two metal boxes of the OBS kits after arrival at a TDY location, if the stay will be longer than 3 days. A2.1.3.  Ensure only enough cleaning supplies are stored in the galley compartment to clean the area for one mission. Store the remaining cleaning supplies and all onboard bench stock in the dedicated crew chief box in the aft lower lobe. A2.2.  Loading Procedures.  The following loading procedures apply to all E-3 operations. For more specific guidelines, refer to the following T.O.s: 1E-3A-1, 1E-3A-5-1, 1E-3A-5-2, and 1E-3A-2-7. A2.2.1.  OBS Kits.  An  OBS kit consists of as  many  as  five metal boxes and one fiberglass box containing an inertial navigation unit (INU). If maintenance requires OBS kits, install the five metal boxes in the forward lower lobe using the rail system described in T.O. 1E-3A-2-7. Any other method of securing the metal boxes in the forward lower lobe is not acceptable. Secure  the  INU  in  the  “J”  compartment  with  cargo  straps.  Weight  of  OBS  kits  vary.  The actual weight is annotated on each box. The crew chief will be responsible for recording the weights of each box and its location with an AFTO Form 781A entry. For mission planning purposes, use the standard weight of 650 pounds in the forward lower lobe and 127 pounds in “J” compartment. Make adjustments on DD Form 3654 as necessary. After arrival at a TDY location, if the stay will be longer than 3 days, remove at least the forward two metal OBS kit boxes  from  the  aircraft  to  allow  for  better  access  to  the  area  for  firefighting,  etc.,  if  the location has a means of securing the kits. A2.2.2.  Technical Orders.  Carry one case of T.O.s when an OBS kit is loaded. Store in the “J” compartment and secure with cargo straps. A2.2.3.  Tool Box: A2.2.3.1.  Secure  the  inflight  tool  box  carried  by  the  CT  in  the  “J”  compartment  with cargo straps. A2.2.3.2.  When a crew chief tool box is required; secure it at the tie down point in the aft lower lobe or in “J” compartment with cargo straps. A2.2.4.  Crew Baggage. In order to facilitate loading, crewmembers and PAX will maximize the  use  of  soft  luggage  (i.e.,  issued  B4,  A3,  and  hang-up  bags)  for  exercises  and deployments. Crewmembers should be aware that  proper aircraft/loading requires strapping the load down tightly in order to prevent load shifting. Crewmembers are normally allowed a baggage  limit  of  25  pounds  on  short  term  TDYs  (7  days  or  less)  and  55  pounds  on  longer deployments. However, if on mission planning day, weight appears to be critical, the AC and FE  will  determine  the  maximum  allowable  baggage  weight  and  inform  crewmembers  and passengers of how much they will be allowed to carry.  Baggage will be secured at a height 62 AFI11-2E-3V3  2 MARCH 2016 no higher than 40 inches in “J” compartment. Small, carry-on type baggage may be stacked higher that 40 inches provided they are secured at or below 40 inches. A2.2.5.  Jackets and Garment Bags. Jackets and lightweight garment bags may be stored on the clothing rack next to the lavatory. A2.2.6.  SF6. Up to four additional SF6 bottles, empty or full, may be stored in the aft lower lobe.  Bottles  will  be  secured  in  the  SF6  storage  racks,  if  the  aircraft  is  modified.  If  not modified, use cargo straps, and up to four small bottles can be stored. A2.2.7.  RMA Kits.  Store RMA kits in the area under the DDI at seat 8. A2.2.8.  Additional  Baggage/Equipment.  “J”  compartment  loading  will  be  accomplished IAW T.O. 1E-3A-5-2. A2.2.9.  General: A2.2.9.1.  Mission  crewmembers  should  store  professional  gear  (i.e.,  pubs/helmet  bag) either in “J” compartment or at their individual consoles in a manner that will minimize movement of gear. A2.2.9.2.  Compartment weight limitations will be IAW T.O. 1E-3A-1. A2.2.9.3.  Crew  bunks  will  only  be  used  for  storing  pillows  and  blankets  which  will  be secured by seatbelts. Nothing will be stored beneath the bunks. Floor rings used to secure bunks to the floor will not be used for luggage/equipment tie down.  AFI11-2E-3V3  2 MARCH 2016 63 Attachment 3 E-3 PASSENGER BRIEFING GUIDE A3.1.
