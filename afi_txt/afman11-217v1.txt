 BY ORDER OF THE  SECRETARY OF THE AIR FORCE AIR FORCE MANUAL 11-217, VOLUME 1 22 OCTOBER 2010 Flying Operations INSTRUMENT FLIGHT PROCEDURES  COMPLIANCE WITH THIS PUBLICATION IS MANDATORY ACCESSIBILITY:  Publications and forms are available on the e-Publishing website at www.e-Publishing.af.mil for downloading or ordering. RELEASABILITY:  There are no releasability restrictions on this publication  OPR:   HQ AFFSA/A3OF Supersedes:   AFMAN11-217V1, 3 January 2005 Certified by: HQ USAF/A3O-B (Mr. Steven Pennington) Pages: 285   This  instruction  implements  AFPD  11-2,  Flight  Rules  and  Procedures,  by  providing  guidance and  procedures  for  standard  Air  Force  instrument  flying.    Since  aircraft  flight  instrumentation and mission objectives are so varied, this instruction is necessarily general regarding equipment and  detailed  regarding  accomplishment  of  maneuvers.    The  guidance  found  in  this  manual  is both  technique  and  procedure.    Text  depicted  in  bold  italics  is  procedure.  Compliance  with procedures  is  the  responsibility  of  the  pilot  but  their  completion  may  be  delegated  to  other crewmembers  in  multicrew  aircraft.    Individual  aircraft  flight  manuals  should  provide  detailed instructions required for particular aircraft instrumentation or characteristics.  This manual, when used  with  related  flight  directives  and  publications,  provides  adequate  guidance  for  instrument flight under most circumstances, but is not a substitute for sound judgment.  Circumstances may require  modification  of  prescribed  procedures.    Aircrew  members  charged  with  the  safe operation of United States Air Force aircraft must be knowledgeable of the guidance contained in this  manual.    This  publication  applies  to  the  Air  National  Guard  (ANG)  and  the  Air  Force Reserves.    This  publication  is  applicable  to  all  USAF  aircraft,  to  include  Unmanned  Aerial Vehicles (UAS), unless specifically exempted in the text of the manual.  This manual applies to all military, civilian and/or contractor personnel operating USAF aircraft.  Note:    This  manual  is  designed  to  complement  AFI  11-202,  Volume  3  General  Flight  Rules.  While  General  Flight  Rules  instructs  aircrews  in  WHAT  to  do,  AFMAN  11-217  instructs aircrews in HOW to do it.  In case of conflict between this manual and AFI 11-202V3, AFI 11-202V3, takes precedence.   WAIVERS:    In  general,  waivers  are  not  granted  to  AFMAN  11-217  as  this  manual  describes procedures for complying with rules in AFI 11-202V3.  Waivers are more appropriately granted to  the  rules  in  General  Flight  Rules.    Waivers  granted  to  AFI  11-202V3  also  apply  to   2  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 corresponding applicable sections of AFMAN 11-217.  A separate waiver is  not  required.   If a MAJCOM desires a waiver to a bold italic procedure in AFMAN 11-217 that is not addressed in General Flight Rules, comply with the Waiver and Exemption guidance in AFI 11-202V3.   Note:    The  Aeronautical  Information  Manual  (AIM)  published  by  the  Federal  Aviation Administration (FAA) is not regulatory.  However, it provides information that reflects examples of operating techniques  and procedures that may be requirements in  other regulations.   AIM is not  binding  on  USAF  aircrews.    Furthermore,  it  contains  some  techniques  and  procedures  not consistent  with  USAF  mission  requirements,  regulatory  guidance,  waivers,  exemptions,  and accepted techniques and procedures.  However, AIM is the accepted standard in the civil aviation community  and  reflects  general  techniques  and  procedures  used  by  other  pilots.    Much information contained in this AFMAN is reproduced from AIM and adapted for USAF use.  If a particular subject is not covered in this AFMAN or other USAF regulations, follow guidance in AIM unless mission requirements dictate otherwise. SUMMARY OF CHANGES This  manual  has  been  substantially  revised  and  must  be  thoroughly  reviewed.    Major  changes include  paragraph  renumbering,  significant  reorganization  of  material  and  removal  of  certain information.    Most  material  in  the  previous  version  that  would  be  considered  ―technique‖  or supplemental  in  nature  has  been  moved  to  AFMAN  11-217  Vol  3,  Supplemental  Flight Information leaving primarily instrument procedural guidance in this volume.

Instrument  Categories.  Aircraft  performance  is  achieved  by  controlling  the  aircraft attitude and power.  Aircraft attitude is the relationship of its longitudinal and lateral axes to the Earth's horizon.  An aircraft is flown in instrument flight by controlling the attitude and power as necessary to  produce the desired performance.  This  is  known as the "control and performance concept"  of  attitude  instrument  flying  (Figure  1.1)  and  can  be  applied  to  any  basic  instrument maneuver.  The three general categories of instruments are: 1.1.1.  Control  instruments:    Display  immediate  attitude  and  power  indications  and  are calibrated to permit adjustments in definite amounts.  Control is monitored by referencing the attitude  direction  indicators  (ADIs).    Measures  of  power  vary  with  aircraft  and  include tachometers, engine pressure ratio (EPR), manifold pressure, fuel flow, torque, etc. 1.1.2.  Performance  instruments:    Indicate  the  results  of  pilot  control  input.    Performance instruments  include  the  altimeter,  airspeed  or  mach  indicator,  vertical  velocity  indicator, heading indicator, angle of attack indicator, and turn and slip indicator. 1.1.3.  Navigation  Instruments  indicate  the  position  of  the  aircraft  in  relation  to  a  selected navigation  facility  or  fix.    This  group  of  instruments  includes  various  types  of  course indicators, range indicators, glide slope indicators, and bearing pointers. Figure 1.1.  Attitude Instrument Flying. 1.2.  Control  and  Performance  Concept.  The  pilot  establishes  an  attitude  and  power  setting that  will  result  in  the  desired  aircraft  performance,  trims  the  aircraft  for  hands-off  flight,  and references the performance instruments.  If deviations occur, power and attitude corrections are made  and  the  process  repeats.    In  general,  small  smooth  corrections  coupled  with  an  efficient  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   13  crosscheck will result in the best aircraft performance.  (The instrument crosscheck is discussed later in the chapter.). 1.2.1.  Attitude  Control.    Proper  instrument  aircraft  attitude  control  is  accomplished  by making appropriate control inputs and verifying the result on the ADI.  The ADI provides an immediate, direct and corresponding indication of any change in aircraft pitch or bank. 1.2.1.1.  Pitch  Control.    Changing  the  vertical  position  of  the  miniature  aircraft  or fuselage dot in relation to the artificial horizon makes pitch changes.  These changes are measured in degrees or bar widths depending on the type of ADI. 1.2.1.2.  Bank Control.  Changing the ―bank attitude‖ or bank pointers a definite amount in relation to the bank scale makes bank changes.  The bank scale is normally graduated at 0°, 10°, 20°, 30°, 60°, and 90° and may be located at the top or bottom of the attitude reference. 1.2.1.3.  Yaw axis control.  Yaw control references on an ADI are normally located at the bottom of the case in the form of a ball in a fluid filled tube and a turn needle or on an indicator  below  the  ADI  on  the  MFD  if  equipped  with  electronic  flight  instrument display.  These indicators are called the turn and slip indicator but are commonly referred to  as  the  ―needle  and  ball.‖    The  use  of  rudders  or  anti-torque  to  maintain  coordinated flight is important in all aircraft but is critical to instrument flight in helicopters.  Yaw is usually  the  most  unstable  axis  in  helicopters,  particularly  in  those  not  equipped  with  a Stability Augmentation System (SAS).  The instability in the yaw axis is compounded by power  changes  that  cause  a  yawing  moment  which  can  cause  induced  vertigo.    Pilot anticipation  and  smoothness  of  rudder  or  anti-torque  inputs  during  power  changes  will keep yaw moments to a minimum. 1.2.2.  Power  Control.    Proper  power  control  allows  the  pilot  to  smoothly  establish  or maintain  desired  airspeeds  in  coordination  with attitude  changes.    Power  changes  are  made by  throttle  adjustments  or  collective  pitch  in  helicopters  and  referencing  power  indicators.  With  experience  pilots  learn  approximately  how  far  to  move  the  throttles  or  collective  to change  the  power  a  given  amount.    Learning  how  to  set  approximate  power  settings, crosschecking  and then  fine tuning prevents  fixating on performance instruments and over-controlling power. 1.2.3.  Trim.    Aircraft  trim  relieves  control  pressure  and  improves  attitude  control.    The decrease in  attention required to  maintain aircraft  attitude increases the amount of attention the pilot can give to clearing and other cockpit duties. 1.2.3.1.  To trim properly, first use the controls to set the desired aircraft attitude, then use the trim to relieve the control pressure.  Do not use trim to control the aircraft. 1.2.3.2.  Any  change  in  attitude,  power  or  airspeed  will  usually  result  in  the  need  for  a trim adjustment.  Experienced pilots develop a feel for minor out-of-trim conditions and correct them smoothly.  In asymmetric power situations (e.g. engine failure) trim can be useful for reducing cockpit workload and enhancing pilot efficiency.   14  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 Figure 1.2.  Instrument Cross-Check Technique. 1.2.4.  Cross-Check Technique (Figure 1.2).  1.2.4.1.  Crosschecking  is  the  efficient  division  of  attention  between  control  and performance  instruments,  the  ability  to  interpret  the  information  given  by  those instruments,  and  the  correction  of  any  discrepancies  noted  in  aircraft  flight  parameters.  The  act  of  crosschecking  is  often  compared  to  the  hub  and  spokes  of  a  wagon  wheel where  the  ADI  is  the  hub  and  the  other  instruments  are  the  spokes.    In  general,  the crosscheck will progress from  the ADI, out  to  another instrument,  back  to  the ADI  and then out again. 1.2.4.2.  Performance  Instrument  Lag.    Due  to  mechanical  characteristics  of  some instruments and the inertial properties of flight, there is an inherent lag between a control input and the appearance of the effects of that input on the performance instruments.  A common  mistake  is  to  watch  the  performance  instruments  while  making  control  inputs, resulting  in  overshoot  of  desired  flight  parameters.    Experienced  pilots  learn  to  make small calculated inputs and allow the performance instruments to catch up before making another input. 1.2.4.3.  Fixating  on  a  single  instrument  is  a  common  and  dangerous  error  made  by inexperienced pilots.  If one flight parameter, (e.g. altitude) is frequently wandering, the pilot will devote too much time to the altimeter and lose track of other critical parameters (e.g. attitude).  The pilot must remember that the attitude of the aircraft, not the altimeter, is what is causing the aircraft to be off altitude.  Returning to the basic crosscheck flow will solve the problem and prevent the aircraft from entering a dangerous attitude. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   15  Figure 1.3.  Typical Instrument Cockpit Layout. 1.3.  Display  of  Flight  Instrumentation  (Figure  1  3).    Display  options  vary  widely  from aircraft to  aircraft and incorporate different  symbologies and terminology  for similar functions.  Electronic displays allow the pilot to optimize cockpit instrumentation for a particular mission by decluttering,  removing,  or  relocating  presentations.    However,  with  very  few  exceptions,  Air Force  instrument  cockpits  must  adhere  to  the  following  specific  rules  of  instrumentation, equipage and setup:  1.3.1.  Primary  Flight  Instrumentation.    Primary  flight  instrumentation  must  always  be present.  It must provide full-time attitude, altitude, and airspeed information, an immediately discernible  attitude  recognition  capability,  an  unusual  attitude  recovery  capability,  and complete fault indications. 1.3.2.  Position  of Flight  Instrumentation.  Primary  Flight  Instrumentation information  must be  positioned  and  arranged  in  a  manner  that  enables  the  pilot  to  perform  an  efficient crosscheck. 1.3.3.  Standardization  of  Flight  Instrumentation.    Primary  Flight  Instrumentation  must  be standardized  in  terminology,  symbology,  mechanization,  and  arrangement.    Standardization of  instrumentation  display  elements  provides  a  common  training  base  and  allows  the retention of good flying habits during transition to different aircraft.   16  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 Chapter 2 INSTRUMENT FLIGHT MANEUVERS 2.1.  Basic Maneuvers.  The procedures described in this section are those most commonly used during instrument flight (Figure 2.1).  A high level of proficiency employing these procedures is necessary to avoid the hazards of instrument flight.  Additional procedures may be required for specific  training  requirements  or  helicopter  operations.    Refer  to  applicable  sections  of  your flight manual.  (The ability of the helicopter to maneuver in a smaller amount of airspace has led to some differences between fixed-wing and helicopter instrument procedure obstacle clearance criteria.  AFMAN 11-226 United States Standard for Terminal Instrument Procedures (TERPS) outlines  these  differences  as  they  apply  to  the  rotary-wing  environment.    Except  where specifically  addressed  in  this  chapter,  helicopters  should  apply  normal  procedures  to  flying instrument approaches, departures, and enroute operations.) Figure 2.1.  Typical Instrument Flight.  2.2.  The Instrument Takeoff (ITO). 2.2.1.  The ITO is accomplished by referring to both outside visual references and the flight instruments  (composite cross-check).   The  amount of attention given to  each  reference  will vary  depending  on  the  existing  weather  conditions.    ITO  procedures  and  techniques  are invaluable  aids  at  night,  toward  and  over  water  or  deserted  areas,  and  during  periods  of reduced visibility.  The pilot shall  immediately transition to instrument references any time he or she becomes disoriented or when outside visual references become unreliable. 2.2.2.  Before  performing  an  ITO,  accomplish  a  thorough  before-takeoff  check  of  all  flight and navigation instruments  and publications.  Select  the appropriate navigational  aids  to  be used for the departure and set the navigation instruments and switches as required based on AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   17  the departure assigned by Air Traffic Control (ATC).  Thoroughly review, have available and brief crewmembers on the appropriate emergency return approach procedures. 2.2.3.  Perform  the  ITO  the  same  as  you  would  a  normal  visual  departure  except  that  as outside visual cues begin to  disappear, shift more attention to the instrument cockpit  check and  confirm  a  stable  and  safe  climbout  flight  path  using  ADI,  altimeter,  VVI,  airspeed indicator, etc.  Once all visual cues are gone, transition solely to instruments and comply with the  assigned  departure  procedure.    If  clouds  are  layered,  use  caution  not  to  trust  outside visual cues as a high possibility of spatial disorientation exists. 2.2.4.  In  helicopters,  an  ITO  may  be  accomplished  from  a  hover  or  from  the  ground  as visibility  restrictions  permit.    Normally,  a  composite  takeoff  is  accomplished  using  normal visual  meteorological  conditions  (VMC)  procedures  and  combining  reference  to  the  flight instruments  with  outside  visual  references  to  provide  a  smooth  transition  from  VMC  to instrument  meteorological  conditions  (IMC)  flight.    Helicopter  ITOs  may  have  to  be accomplished  entirely  on  instruments  due  to  restrictions  to  visibility  induced  by  rotor downwash  on  dust,  sand,  or  snow.    Follow  flight  manual  procedures  for  an  ITO  where visibility is restricted due to rotor downwash. 2.3.  Individual Maneuvers. 2.3.1.  Straight  and  Level  Flight.    Straight  and  level  unaccelerated  flight  consists  of maintaining desired altitude, heading, and airspeed. 2.3.1.1.  Maintaining a Desired Altitude. 2.3.1.1.1.  Maintaining  altitude  is  accomplished  by  setting  a  specific  pitch  on  the ADI.    In  general,  as  airspeed  decreases,  a  higher  pitch  attitude  will  be  required  to maintain  altitude  due  to  the  loss  of  lift.    Conversely,  higher  airspeeds  will  require lower  pitch  attitudes.    Each  aircraft  has  basic  pitch  and  power  settings  to  maintain altitude  and  airspeed  but  these  may  need  to  be  adjusted  slightly  for  various atmospheric conditions. 2.3.1.1.2.  Pitch  corrections.    While  maintaining  altitude,  continue  the  instrument crosscheck.  If the altimeter or VVI indicate an altitude deviation, a pitch change will be  necessary.    It  is  important  to  use  control  pressure  more  than  movement,  make smooth and small pitch changes, and allow the performance instruments time to sense the  new  attitude  before  making  an  additional  correction.    The  most  common  errors when  correcting  altitude  deviations  are  ―chasing‖  the  VVI  rather  than  setting  a  new pitch  on  the  ADI,  and  making  erratic  or  large  control  inputs.        Once  back  on  the desired  altitude,  make  another  small  and  smooth  pitch  correction  on  the  ADI  to maintain altitude remembering that  it will be slightly different  than the  pitch setting held when the altitude deviation originally occurred. 2.3.1.1.2.1.  As a rule of thumb, when making pitch corrections, a VVI one to two times the amount of the altitude deviation will prevent overshoots.  (e.g. If you are 100  feet  off  altitude,  set  a  pitch  that  will  produce  a  100  to  200  foot  per  minute climb or descent on the VVI.)  Refer to AFMAN 11-217V3 for a discussion of the 60:1  rule  and  its  use  for  setting  a  VVI.    Approaching  the  desired  altitude,  begin the  pitch  change  to  level  off  approximately  10%  of  your  vertical  rate.    (e.g.    If VVI shows 100 feet per minute, level off 10 feet prior to your altitude. Figure 2.2)   18  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 Figure 2.2.  Leading the Level Off. 2.3.1.2.  Maintaining a Desired Heading.  2.3.1.2.1.  Maintaining a desired heading is accomplished by maintaining a zero bank attitude  in  coordinated  flight.    If  a  heading  deviation  occurs,  make  a  smooth  bank change  on  the  ADI  to  return  to  the  desired  heading.    As  a  guide,  the  bank  attitude change on the ADI should equal the heading deviation in degrees, not to exceed 30°.  For  example,  if  the  heading  deviation  is  10°,  then  10°  of  bank  would  produce  a suitable  rate  of  correction.    (At  high  true  airspeeds  a  larger  bank  may  be  needed  to prevent a prolonged correction.) 2.3.1.2.1.1.  If  a  zero  bank  attitude  is  maintained  and  the  heading  changes,  the ADI  may  be  precessing.    Confirm  this  by  referencing  backup  ADI‘s.    If precession  is  noted,  it  may  be  necessary  to  transition  to  the  backup  ADI depending on the severity of the precession. 2.3.1.3.  Maintaining Airspeed. 2.3.1.3.1.  Establishing or maintaining an airspeed is accomplished by referring to the airspeed or mach indicator and adjusting the power, drag devices (for large airspeed changes)  or  aircraft  attitude.    Knowledge  of  the  approximate  power  required  to establish  a  desired  airspeed  at  a  specific  attitude  will  aid  in  making  power adjustments.  After the approximate power setting is established, a crosscheck of the airspeed indicator will indicate if subsequent power adjustments are required. 2.3.1.3.1.1.  An  airspeed  deviation  may  be  the  result  of  a  pitch  change,  not  an incorrect power setting.  (See Figure 2.3)  Check all other flight parameters when an airspeed deviation occurs.  Conversely, if in level flight and a power change is necessary  to  correct  airspeed,  the  new  power  setting  or  the  employment  of  drag AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   19  devices coupled with  a change in  airspeed may induce a climb  or descent.   This relationship  between  airspeed  and  aircraft  attitude  further the importance of a good instrument crosscheck. illustrates Figure 2.3.  Airspeed Deviation. 2.3.2.  Level Turns.  Many of the pitch, bank, and power principles discussed in maintaining straight and level flight apply while performing level turns.  Performing a level turn requires an understanding of several factors: how to enter the turn, how to maintain bank, altitude, and airspeed during the turn; and how to return to level flight. A standard rate turn is defined as a rate at which the aircraft will make a 360 degree turn in two minutes (120 seconds).  2.3.2.1.  Bank Control.  As a guide, to prevent heading overshoots or prolonged turns, for heading changes of 30° or less, the bank angle should approximate the number of degrees to be turned (Figure 2.4).  For heading changes of more than 30°, use a bank angle of 30°.  High  turn  airspeeds  or  flight  manual  procedures  may  require  other  angles  of  bank.  Helicopters  should  use  no  more  than  standard  rate  turns  (15⁰   to  20⁰ )  when  operating between 80 and 120 knots. 2.3.2.2.  To enter a turn, refer to the ADI while applying smooth and coordinated control pressures to establish the desired angle of bank.  It will normally be necessary to increase pitch slightly to counteract the loss of vertical lift due to the bank.  The increased pitch in prolonged turns will require consistent back pressure on the elevator control.  Trimming off the pressure on the elevator will aid in smooth aircraft control and enhance crosscheck capability  in  the  turn.    Additionally,  to  maintain  airspeed,  an  increase  in  power  will  be required to counteract the induced drag produced by the elevator inputs.  The bank, pitch   20  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 change and power increase should all be applied smoothly as the aircraft enters the turn to prevent the need for large corrections during the turn. Figure 2.4.  Level Turns.  2.3.2.3.  To  roll  out  of  a  turn  on  a  desired  heading,  calculate  a  lead  point  that  is,  as  a guide, approximately one-third the angle of bank used in the turn.  (Figure 2.4)  When the lead point is reached, simply reverse the bank, pitch, trim and power inputs used to roll into  the  turn,  smoothly  and  simultaneously.    Once  on  the  new  heading,  check  for deviations from straight and level flight and apply corrections as needed. 2.3.2.4.  Steep  Turns.    Steep  turns  are  practiced  in  simulated  instrument  conditions (hooded or goggled) and are normally any turn greater than 30° of bank.  The entry and exit into and from a steep turn is identical to a normal turn except that all inputs will be more pronounced.  The increased bank will require more pitch, more back pressure and more power to counteract the further reduced vertical lift.  The rate of turn will be much faster in a steep turn and will require a more aggressive lead point as well as smooth yet positive  control  inputs  to  roll  out  on  the  correct  heading  without  significant  altitude  or airspeed deviations.  For helicopters, any rate greater than standard is considered a steep turn,  most  helicopters  practice  steep  turns  using  30°  of  bank,  which  is  the  maximum angle of bank recommended under instrument conditions. 2.3.3.  Timed  Turns  and  Use  of  the  Magnetic  Compass.    Heading  indicator  failure  may require  use  of  the  magnetic  compass  for  heading  information.    The  magnetic  compass AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   21  provides  reliable  information  only  during  straight,  level,  and  unaccelerated  flight.    Because of this limitation, timed turns are recommended when making heading changes by reference to the magnetic compass. 2.3.3.1.  A timed turn is accomplished by establishing a bank attitude on the ADI that will result  in  a  desired  rate  of  turn  as  shown  by  the  turn  needle.    A  single  needle  width deflection  on  a  4-minute  turn  needle  indicates  1  1/2°  per  second  rate  of  turn,  while  a double needle width deflection indicates 3° per second rate of turn.  Therefore, a 90° turn can be made by establishing a bank angle that produces a double needle width deflection for 30 seconds. 2.3.3.2.  Alternate method.  Although timed turns are preferred when using the magnetic compass,  turns  to  headings  can  be  made  by  referring  directly  to  the  magnetic  compass and rolling out of the turn at a predetermined "lead" point.  Dip error (or magnetic dip) must be considered in computing the lead point for rollout.  Magnetic dip is the tendency of the compass needles to point down as well as to the magnetic pole. Dip is greatest near the poles and least near the Magnetic Equator. The compass card is designed to operate in the  horizontal,  therefore,  any  movement  from  the  horizontal  plane  introduces  dip  error. Turns to the north require a normal lead point plus a number of degrees equal to the flight latitude while turns to the south require turning past the desired heading by the number of degrees equal to the flight latitude minus the normal lead.  Dip error is negligible when turning to east or west. 2.3.4.  Climbs  and  Descents.    Climbing  and  descending  maneuvers  can  be  performed  as constant  airspeed  or  constant  rate.    The  constant  airspeed  maneuver  is  accomplished  by setting power and varying pitch to maintain a specific airspeed.  The constant rate maneuver is accomplished by varying both pitch and power to maintain a specific airspeed and vertical velocity.    Either  type  of  climb  or  descent  may  be  performed  while  maintaining  a  constant heading  or  while  turning  and  should  be  practiced  using  airspeeds,  configurations,  and altitudes used in actual instrument flight. 2.3.4.1.  Constant Airspeed Climbs and Descents. 2.3.4.1.1.  Most  aircraft  have  a  standard  set  of  pitch  and  power  settings  for  certain airspeeds and configurations.  For instance, in order to maintain 300 KIAS in a clean configuration,  an  aircraft  might  require  10°  nose  down  pitch  at  idle  power.    A  pilot might also know that for that aircraft, each degree of pitch change at a constant power setting  and  configuration  will  change  the  airspeed  10KIAS.    With  this  simple knowledge, a pilot has a very high level of control over his aircraft. 2.3.4.1.2.  To  perform  the  constant  airspeed  climb  or  descent  make  a  smooth  and simultaneous  change  in  pitch  and  power  corresponding  to  the  desired  airspeed  and configuration.    Once  the  initial  attitude  is  established,  fine-tune  the  airspeed  by adjusting pitch.   Confirm  the pitch change by  noting a change on the VVI and wait for  the  airspeed  to  stabilize.    Continue  this  process  until  the  desired  airspeed  is attained.  Remember that this procedure must be accomplished as part of a complete instrument crosscheck. 2.3.4.1.3.  Approaching  your  level-off  altitude  (approximately  10%  of  your  vertical velocity is a good lead point) smoothly adjust pitch and power to maintain a constant   22  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 altitude  without  changing  airspeed.    Note:    For  climb  or  descent  rates  of  2000  or more, at 1000 feet prior to the level off altitude it is a good technique to cut the pitch attitude in half to enable a smoother level-off.  Adjust power as necessary to maintain airspeed.  (On most aircraft, changing the total fuel flow in pph the same amount as the change in VVI will result in a constant airspeed.) 2.3.4.2.  Rate Climbs and Descents. 2.3.4.2.1.  Rate  climbs  and  descents  are  similar  to  constant  airspeed  climbs  and descents  but  require  a  constant  VVI.    Using  the  60  to  1  rule  (AFMAN  11-217V3, Chapter  3)  we  know  pitch  multiplied  by  airspeed  in  nm/min  gives  VVI  in  100‘s  of ft/min.  (e.g. Traveling 300 KIAS or 5 nm/min, a 2° pitch change will result in a VVI of  1000  ft/min).    Another  rule  of  thumb  that  works  for  most  aircraft:    A  change  in total fuel flow in pph equal to the change in VVI will maintain a given airspeed.  (e.g. On a two engine aircraft, reducing power by 500 pph on each engine will maintain a constant airspeed if the aircraft pitches down to maintain 1000 ft/min VVI) 2.3.4.2.2.  EXAMPLE:    From  level  flight  at  240KIAS  (4  nm/min)  a  C-130  pilot desires to maintain 240 KIAS with a VVI of 2000 ft.min.  Smoothly decreasing pitch by  5°  and  reducing  fuel  flow  on  each  engine  by  500  pph  will  achieve  the  desired descent rate at the approximate desired airspeed.  A good instrument crosscheck and some  minor  power  adjustments  will  fine-tune  the  descent  profile.    Accomplish  the level off as described in 2.3.5.1.3. 2.3.4.3.  Emergency Descent.  (Helicopters)  Basic instrument techniques may be used to safely  perform  an  emergency  descent  in  IMC.    Because  there  is  no  set  procedure,  you must consider all variables when executing an emergency descent.  If  your helicopter is equipped  with  a  radar  altimeter,  it  is  a  good  technique  to  set  the  low  altitude  warning marker at or slightly above the required flare altitude.  This will give you a reminder to start a flare if the flare altitude is reached prior to breaking out of IMC. 2.3.4.3.1.  Power-On  Descent.    If  a  long  distance  must  be  covered,  then  a  constant airspeed  descent  could  be  selected  using  higher  than  normal  airspeeds.    If  a  short distance  is  to  be  covered,  then  a  constant  rate  descent  could  be  selected  using  high rates of descent and slower than normal airspeeds. 2.3.4.3.2.  Power-Off Descent (Autorotation).  If an emergency requires autorotation, enter smoothly by lowering the collective and closely cross-checking the control and performance instruments.  Knowing (and briefing) the approximate ceiling will aid in determining  when  to  begin  a  systematic  scan  for  outside  references.    Crew coordination  will  be  critical  and  should  be  briefed  prior  to  flight  by  the  aircraft commander. 2.4.  Basic Aircraft Control Maneuvers—Fixed Wing. 2.4.1.  Vertical "S" Series.  The vertical "S" maneuvers are proficiency maneuvers designed to improved a pilot's crosscheck and aircraft control.  There are four types: the A, B, C, and D which can be flown utilizing various configurations, airspeeds, turn and decent rates, etc. to practice all phases of instrument flight (cruise, approach descent, missed approach, etc.). AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   23  2.4.1.1.  The  vertical  "S"-A  maneuver  (Figure  2.5).  The  vertical  S-A    is  a  continuous series of rate climbs and descents flown on a constant heading utilizing a vertical velocity compatible with aircraft performance. Figure 2.5.  Vertical "S"- A. 2.4.1.2.  The vertical "S"- B (Figure 2.6).  The vertical ―S‖-B is the same as the vertical "S"- A except that a constant angle of bank is maintained during the climb and descent.  The  angle  of  bank  used  should  be  compatible  with  aircraft  performance  (usually  that required for a normal turn).  The turn is established simultaneously with the initial climb or descent.  Figure 2.6.  Vertical "S"- B. 2.4.1.3.  The vertical "S"- C (Figure 2.7).  The vertical  ―S‖-C is the same as vertical "S"- B, except that the direction of turn is reversed at the beginning of each descent.  Enter the vertical "S" - C in the same manner as the vertical "S"- B.    24  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 2.4.1.4.  Vertical  "S"-  D.    (Figure  2.7).    The  vertical  "S"-  D  is  the  same  as  the  vertical "S"- C, except that the direction of turn is reversed simultaneously with each change of vertical direction.  Enter the vertical "S"- D in the same manner as the vertical "S"- B or C. Figure 2.7.  Vertical "S"- C and "S"- D.  2.4.2.  Confidence  Maneuvers.    Present  missions  require  some  aircraft  to  be  flown  in  all attitudes  under  instrument  conditions.    Such  aircraft  have  ADIs  capable  of  indicating  these attitudes.  Confidence maneuvers are basic aerobatic maneuvers designed to gain confidence in the use of the ADI in extreme pitch and bank attitudes.  Mastering these maneuvers will be helpful when recovering from unusual attitudes.  The pilot should consult the aircraft flight manual for performance characteristics and limitations before practicing these maneuvers. 2.4.2.1.  Wingover (Figure 2.8).  Begin the maneuver from straight and level flight.  After obtaining the desired airspeed, start a climbing turn in either direction while maintaining the  wing  tip  of  the  miniature  aircraft  on  the  horizon  bar  until  reaching  60°  of  bank.  Allow  the  nose  of  the  aircraft  to  start  down  while  continuing  to  increase  the  angle  of bank,  planning  to  arrive  at  90°  of  bank  as  the  fuselage  dot  of  the  miniature  aircraft reaches  the  horizon  bar.    Begin  decreasing  the  angle  of  bank  as  the  fuselage  dot  of  the miniature  aircraft  reaches  the  horizon  bar  so  that  the  wing  tip  of  the  miniature  aircraft reaches the horizon bar as 60° of bank is reached.  Maintain the wing tip on the horizon bar while rolling to a wings level attitude.  The rate of roll during the recovery should be the same as the rate of roll used during the entry.  Control pitch and bank throughout the maneuver by reference to the ADI. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   25  Figure 2.8.  Attitude Indications During Wingover. 2.4.2.2.  Aileron  Roll  (Figure  2.9).    Begin  the  maneuver  from  straight  and  level  flight.  After obtaining the desired airspeed, smoothly increase the pitch attitude with the wings level 15° to 25° nose up on the ADI.  Start a roll in either direction and adjust the rate of roll  so  that,  when  inverted,  the  wings  will  be  level  as  the  fuselage  dot  of  the  miniature aircraft passes through the horizon bar.  Continue the roll and recover to level flight.  The entire  maneuver  should  be  accomplished  by  reference  to  the  ADI.    Use  sufficient  back pressure to maintain normal seat pressures (approximately 1 g) throughout the maneuver.    26  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 Figure 2.9.  Attitude Indications During Aileron Roll. 2.5.  Unusual Attitudes.  2.5.1.  Definition.  An unusual attitude is an aircraft attitude occurring inadvertently.  It may result  from  one  factor  or  a  combination  of  several  factors  such  as  turbulence,  channelized attention,  instrument  failure,  inattention,  spatial  disorientation,  lost  wingman,  or  transition from  VMC  to  IMC.    In  most  instances  these  attitudes  are  mild  enough  to  recover  by reestablishing  the  proper  attitude  for  the  desired  flight  condition  and  resuming  a  normal crosscheck.  As a result of extensive tactical maneuvering, the pilot may experience unusual attitudes even in VMC.  This may be aggravated by the lack of a definite horizon or by lack of contrast between the sky and ground or water. 2.5.1.1.  WARNING:    The  pilot  will  immediately  transition  to  instrument  references any  time  he  or  she  becomes  disoriented  or  when  outside  visual  references  become unreliable. 2.5.1.2.  WARNING: NVGs may be distracting during unusual attitude recoveries. Once transition to instruments has occurred, do not rely on outside NVG cues until the aircraft is recovered. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   27  2.5.2.  Techniques  of  recovery.    Techniques  of  recovery  should  be  compatible  with  the severity  of  the  unusual  attitude,  the  characteristics  of  the  aircraft,  and  the  altitude  available for  the  recovery.    The  procedures  in  this  section  are  not  designed  for  recovery  from controlled tactical maneuvers. 2.5.3.  Principles  and  considerations. considerations are applicable to the recovery from unusual attitudes:   The  following  aerodynamic  principles  and 2.5.3.1.  Reducing bank in a dive or increasing bank in a climb aids pitch control. 2.5.3.2.  Power and drag.  Power and drag devices used properly  aid  airspeed  control if the flight manual allows their use in unusual attitude situations. 2.5.3.3.  Sky pointer.  For ADIs with a bank pointer and bank scale at the top, the bank pointer  that  is  always  aligned  above  and  perpendicular  to  the  surface  of  the  earth  is considered a sky pointer.  Rolling towards the sky pointer to place it in the upper half of the case will correct an inverted attitude. 2.5.3.4.  Ground  pointer.    For  ADIs  with  the  bank  scale  at  the  bottom,  rolling  in  the direction  that  will  place  the  pitch  reference  scale  right  side  up  will  correct  an  inverted attitude. 2.5.4.  Recognizing  an  Unusual  Attitude  is  critical  to  a  successful  recovery.    Normally,  an unusual attitude is recognized in one of two ways -- an unusual attitude "picture" on the ADI or unusual  performance  on the performance instruments.  Regardless  of  how the  attitude is recognized,  verify  that  an  unusual  attitude  exists  by  comparing  control  and  performance instrument indications prior to initiating recovery on the ADI (Figure 2.10).  This precludes entering  an  unusual  attitude  as  a  result  of  correcting  for  erroneous  instrument  indications.  Additional independent attitude indicating sources (standby ADI, copilot's ADI, etc.) should be used to verify the actual aircraft attitude.  If there is any doubt as to proper ADI operation, then recover using ADI inoperative procedures. Figure 2.10.  Verify That an Unusual Attitude Exists.    28  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 2.5.5.  Fixed  Wing  Recovery  Procedures--ADIs  Operative.    For  fixed-wing  aircraft,  use  the following  procedures  if  specific  unusual  attitude  recovery  procedures  are  not  in  the  flight manual. 2.5.5.1.  If  diving,  adjust  power  or  drag  devices  as  appropriate  while  rolling  to  a  wings level, upright attitude, and correct to level flight on the ADI.  Do not add back pressure until less than 90° of bank. 2.5.5.2.  If  climbing,  use  power  and  bank  as  necessary  to  assist  pitch  control  and  avoid negative G forces.  As the ADI airplane symbol approaches the horizon bar, adjust pitch, bank, and power to  complete recovery and establish the desired aircraft attitude.  When recovering from a steep climb, care must be exercised in some aircraft to avoid exceeding bank limitations. 2.5.5.3.  Bank and power.  During unusual attitude recoveries, unless necessary to avoid a greater emergency, ensure bank and power do not exceed aircraft limitations. 2.5.6.  Fixed  Wing  Recovery  Procedures--ADIs  Inoperative.    With  no  functioning  ADI‘s, successful  recovery  from  unusual  attitudes  depends  greatly  on  pilot  proficiency  and  early recognition of ADI failure.  ADI failure should be immediately suspected if control pressures are  applied  without  corresponding  ADI  changes.    Another  example  would  be  performance instrument  indications that  contradict the "picture" on the ADI.  Should  an unusual  attitude be encountered with no functioning ADI‘s, the following procedures are recommended: 2.5.6.1.  If the flight manual allows and an available autopilot is not slaved to gyros of the malfunctioning ADI‘s, consideration may be given to engaging the autopilot and setting it  to  straight  and  level  flight.    If  airspeed  or  vertical  velocity  are  excessive,  use  the procedures below to return the aircraft to acceptable flight parameters before attempting to engage the autopilot. 2.5.6.2.  Climb  or  dive.    Determine  whether  the  aircraft  is  in  a  climb  or  a  dive  by referring to the airspeed, altimeter, and vertical velocity indicators. 2.5.6.3.  If diving, roll to center the turn needle and recover from the dive.  Adjust power or  drag  devices  as  appropriate.    (Except  for  vertical  attitudes,  rolling  "away"  from  the turn needle and centering it will result in an upright attitude). 2.5.6.4.  If climbing, use power as required.  If the airspeed is low or decreasing rapidly, pitch control may be aided by maintaining a turn of approximately standard rate on the turn needle until reaching level flight. 2.5.6.5.  Level flight.  Upon reaching level flight, center the turn needle.  The aircraft is level when the altimeter stops.  The vertical velocity indicator lag error may cause it not to indicate level until the aircraft passes level flight. 2.5.7.  Helicopter  Recovery  Procedures  --  Attitude  Indicators  Operative.    Recoveries  from helicopter  unusual  attitudes  are  unique  due  to  rotary-wing  aerodynamics  as  well  as application  of  the  control  and  performance  concept  to  helicopter  flight.    Application  of improper  recovery  techniques  can  result  in  blade  stall,  power  settling,  or  an  uncontrollable yaw  if  recovery  is  delayed.    Due  to  these  differences,  unusual  attitude  recoveries  for helicopters are decidedly different from fixed-wing recoveries and require immediate action.  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   29  Use the following guidance if specific unusual attitude recovery procedures are not contained in the flight manual: 2.5.7.1.  Diving.    If  diving,  consider  altitude,  acceleration  limits,  and  the  possibility  of encountering  blade  stall.    If  altitude  permits,  avoid  rolling  pullouts.    To  recover  from  a diving  unusual  attitude,  roll  to  a  wings  level  indication  then  establish  a  level  flight attitude  on  the  attitude  indicator.    Adjust  power  as  necessary  and  resume  a  normal crosscheck. 2.5.7.2.  Climbing.    If  climbing,  consider  pitch  attitude  and  airspeed.    If  the  inadvertent pitch attitude is not extreme (10° or less from level flight), smoothly lower the miniature aircraft back to a level flight indication, level the wings, and resume a normal crosscheck using power as required.  For extreme pitch attitudes (above 10°), bank the aircraft in the shorter direction toward the nearest 30° bank index.  The amount of bank used should be commensurate  with  the  pitch  attitude  and  external  conditions,  but  do  not  exceed  30°  of bank  in  making  the  recovery.    Allow  the  miniature  aircraft  to  fall  toward  the  horizon.  When the aircraft symbol is on the horizon, level the wings and adjust the aircraft attitude to a level flight indication.  Use power as necessary throughout the recovery. 2.5.7.3.  Hover.    If  the  aircraft  is  in  a  hover  or  low  speed  when  the  unusual  attitude  is recognized, smoothly but immediately roll to a wings level attitude and apply maximum power available.  Once attitude control is reestablished, execute an ITO, or refer to hover velocity  instrumentation  to  maintain  position  (if  available).    This  condition  is  most common during dust or  white out  situations, or when performing terminal  operations at night and/or over water. 2.5.7.3.1.  NOTE:  In helicopters encountering an unusual attitude as a result of blade stall, collective must be reduced before applying attitude corrections if the aircraft is in  a  climbing  unusual  attitude.    This  will  aid  in  eliminating  the  possibility  of aggravating  the  blade  stall  condition.    To  aid  in  avoiding  blade  stall  in  a  diving unusual  attitude  recovery,  reduce  power  and  bank  attitude  before  initiating  a  pitch change.  In all cases avoid abnormal positive or negative G loading which could lead to additional unusual attitudes or aircraft structural damage. 2.5.8.  Helicopter  Recovery  Procedures  --  Attitude  Indicators  Inoperative.    With  an inoperative attitude indicator, successful recovery from unusual attitudes depends greatly on pilot  proficiency  and  early  recognition  of  attitude  indicator  failure.    For  example,  attitude indicator failure should be immediately suspected if control pressures are applied for a turn without  corresponding  attitude  indicator  changes.    Another  example  would  be  satisfactory performance  instrument  indications  that  contradict  the  "picture"  on  the  attitude  indicator.  Should  an  unusual  attitude  be  encountered  with  an  inoperative  attitude  indicator,  the following procedures are recommended: 2.5.8.1.  Climb  or  dive.    Determine  whether  the  aircraft  is  in  a  climb  or  a  dive  by referring to the airspeed, altimeter, and vertical velocity indicators. 2.5.8.2.  Diving.    If  diving,  roll  to  center  the  turn  needle  and  recover  from  the  dive.  Adjust  power  as  appropriate.    (Disregarding  vertical  attitudes,  rolling  "away"  from  the turn needle and centering it will result in an upright attitude.)   30  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 2.5.8.3.  Climbing.    If  climbing,  use  power  as  required.    If  the  airspeed  is  low  or decreasing rapidly, pitch control may be aided by maintaining a standard rate turn on the turn  needle  until  reaching  level  flight.    If  the  turn  needle  in  a  flight  director  system  is used, center the turn needle.  This  is  because it is very difficult to  determine between a standard rate turn and full needle deflection. 2.5.8.4.  Level  off.    Upon  reaching  level  flight,  center  the  turn  needle.    The  aircraft  is level when the altimeter stops.  The vertical velocity indicator lag error may cause it not to indicate level until the aircraft passes level flight. 2.5.9.  WARNING:    Spatial  disorientation  may  become  severe  during  the  recovery  from unusual attitudes with inoperative ADI‘s.  Extreme attitudes may result in an excessive loss of  altitude  and  possible  loss  of  aircraft  control.    If  a  minimum  safe  altitude  for  unusual attitude recovery is  not  in the flight  manual,  if applicable, the pilot  shall decide upon an altitude at which recovery attempts will be discontinued and the aircraft abandoned. 2.5.10.  CAUTION:    Due  to  limited  attitude  information,  recovery  from  unusual  attitudes using a HUD may be difficult or impossible. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   31  Chapter 3 NAVIGATION INSTRUMENTS 3.1.  Application.  The  navigation  instruments  explained  in  this  chapter  are  still  common  in many  USAF  aircraft  or  are  incorporated  in  digital  (glass)  cockpit  displays.    These  instruments are the radio magnetic indicator (RMI), course indicator (CI), range indicator, bearing-distance-heading indicator (BDHI), flight director, and Flight Management System (FMS). 3.2.  Basic Systems. 3.2.1.  Radio Magnetic Indicator (RMI) (Figure 3.1).  The RMI displays aircraft heading with navigational bearing data.   It normally consists of a rotating compass  card and two bearing pointers.    The  compass  card  is  actuated  by  the  aircraft  compass  system.    The  aircraft magnetic  heading  is  displayed  on  the  compass  card  beneath  the  top  index.    The  bearing pointers display automatic direction finding (ADF), VHF Omni directional Range (VOR), or Tactical  Air  Navigation  (TACAN)  magnetic  bearing  to  the  selected  navigation  station.  Placards on the instrument or near a selector switch are normally used to identify the bearing pointer  display.    VOR  or  TACAN  radials  are  displayed  under  the  tail  of  their  respective bearing pointers.  Bearing pointers do not  function in  relation  to instrument  landing system (ILS) signals. Figure 3.1.  Navigation Instruments. 3.2.1.1.  Compass System Malfunction.  If there is a malfunction in the compass system or compass card, the ADF bearing pointer continues to point to the station, and displays relative  bearing  only  but  the  VOR  or  TACAN  pointers  may  still  indicate  magnetic bearing.    Until  verified  by  radar  or  other  navigational  equipment,  consider  this  bearing information  unreliable.  VOR and TACAN bearing pointers do not  "point" to  an  area of maximum  signal  strength,  as  does  an  ADF.    VOR  and  TACAN  navigation  receivers electronically measure the magnetic course which is then displayed by the pointers on the RMI.    32  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 3.2.2.  Course Indicator (CI) (Figure 3.1).  The course indicator operates independently of the RMI.    It  displays  aircraft  heading  and  position  relative  to  a  selected  VOR/TACAN  course, and  lateral  and  vertical  position  relative  to  an  ILS  localizer  and  glide  slope.  Most  USAF aircraft now have the functions of the CI incorporated in  the Horizontal  Situation  Indicator (HSI). 3.2.2.1.  VOR or TACAN Display. 3.2.2.1.1.  Course  indicator.    When  the  course  indicator  is  used  to  display  VOR  or TACAN information, aircraft heading and position are indicated relative to a selected course.   The desired course is  set  in the course selector  window with  the course set knob. 3.2.2.1.2.  The  Heading  Pointer.    The  heading  pointer  interfaces  with  the  course  set knob  and  the  compass  system  and  displays  aircraft  heading  relative  to  the  selected course.    When  the  aircraft  heading  is  the  same  as  the  course  selected,  the  heading pointer indicates 0° heading deviation at the top of the course indicator.  The heading deviation  scales,  at  the  top  and  bottom  of  the  course  indicator  are  scaled  in  5° increments  up  to  45°.    The  TO-FROM  indicator  indicates  whether  the  course selected, if properly intercepted and flown, will take the aircraft to or from the station.  When the aircraft passes a line from the station perpendicular to the selected course, the TO-FROM indicator changes.   Aircraft heading has no effect  on the  TO-FROM indications. 3.2.2.1.3.  Course Deviation Indicator.  The course deviation indicator (CDI) displays aircraft  course  deviation  relative  to  the  course  selected.    Most  course  indicators  are adjusted so the CDI is fully displaced when the aircraft is off course more than 10°.  Each dot on the course deviation scale represents 5°. 3.2.2.1.4.  Course  Warning  Flag.    Appearance  of  the  course  warning  flag  indicates that the course indicator is not receiving a signal strong enough for reliable navigation information.   See  Chapter  7  for  discussion  on  Navigation  Aid  (NAVAID) identification. 3.2.2.1.4.1.  NOTE:    Although  the  course  indicator  may  be  receiving  a  signal strong  enough  to  keep  the  course  warning  flag  out  of  view,  consider  the  signal reliable only if the warning flag is not displayed, the station identification is being received and the bearing pointer is pointing to the station. 3.2.2.2.  ILS Display. 3.2.2.2.1.  Localizer Course.  When used to display ILS signals, the course indicator provides  precise  ILS  localizer  course  information  for  a  specified  approach.    The following information pertains to course indicator functions and displays when used with an ILS: 3.2.2.2.1.1.  The TO-FROM indicator is unusable. 3.2.2.2.1.2.  Full-scale  deflection.    Full-scale  deflection  on  the  course  deviation scale  differs  with  the  width  of  the  localizer  course  (up  to  6°).    Example:  If  the localizer course is 5° wide, then full-scale deflection is 2½° and each dot is 1¼°; if the localizer course is 3° wide, then full-scale deflection is 1½° and each dot is AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   33  ¾°. 3.2.2.2.1.3.  When  flying  the  localizer,  the  course  set  knob  and  course  selected have  no  effect  on  the  CDI  display.    The  CDI  displays  only  if  the  aircraft  is  on course  or  in  a  90-  or  150-Hz  zone  of  signals  originating  from  the  ILS  localizer transmitter.  The CDI always deflects to the left of the instrument case in the 150-Hz zone and to the right in the 90-Hz zone.  It centers when the signal strength of both  zones  is  equal.    Although  the  course  selected  has  no  effect  on  the  CDI,  to enhance situational awareness, the pilot should always set the published inbound FRONT COURSE of the ILS in the course selector window. 3.2.2.2.2.  The glide slope indicator (GSI) displays glide slope position relative to the aircraft.    Full-scale  deflection  of  the  GSI  is  dependent  upon  the  width  of  the  glide slope.    Example:  If  the  glide  slope  width  is  1.4°,  full-scale  deflection  would  be  .7°, and each dot would be .35°. 3.2.2.2.3.  Warning  Flags.    Appearance  of  the  course  or  glide  slope  warning  flags indicates that the course or  glide slope signal  strength is  not  sufficient.   Absence of the  identifier  indicates  the  signal  is  unreliable.    See  Chapter  7  for  discussion  on NAVAID identification. 3.2.2.2.3.1.  CAUTION:    It  is  possible  under  certain  conditions  for  the  CDI  or GSI  to  stick  in  any  position  with  no  warning  flags  while  reliable  station identification is being received.  Pilots should use extreme caution and maintain good  situational  awareness  while  flying  an  ILS  or  localizer  approach  in  actual weather conditions. 3.2.2.2.4.  Marker  Beacon.    The  marker  beacon  light  and  aural  tone  indicate proximity  to  a  75-MHz  marker  beacon  transmitter;  for  example,  ILS  outer  marker (OM), middle marker (MM), inner marker (IM), etc.  As the aircraft flies through the marker  beacon  signal  pattern,  the  light  flashes  and  the  aural  tone  sounds  in  Morse code indicating the type of beacon.  The marker beacon light functions independently of ILS/VOR/TACAN signals. 3.2.3.  Range Indicator (Figure 3.1).  Range indicators display slant range distance in nautical miles  to  a  DME  transponder.    For  practical  purposes,  you  may  consider  this  a  horizontal distance  except  when  the  aircraft  is  very  close  to  the  station.    DME  range  information  is subject  to  line-of-sight  restrictions  and  altitude  directly  affects  the  reception  range.  Most USAF aircraft now incorporate DME into the HSI or a separate digital readout display.   34  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 Figure 3.2.  Bearing Distance Heading Indicator (BDHI). 3.2.4.  Bearing-Distance-Heading Indicator (BDHI) (Figure 3.2).  3.2.4.1.  BDHI  Display.    The  BDHI  displays  aircraft  heading  with  navigational  bearing data  and  range  information.    Except  for  the  range  indicator,  the  BDHI  is  similar  in appearance and function to the RMI previously described. 3.2.4.2.  BDHI Components.  The BDHI consists of a rotating compass card, two bearing pointers, a range indicator, and a range warning flag.  Some BDHIs also have a heading marker, a heading set knob, and a power warning flag. 3.2.4.3.  Compass Card Actuation.  The compass card is actuated by the aircraft compass system  which  normally  includes  pilot-operated  controls  that  permit  the  BDHI  compass card to operate in a slaved or non-slaved direct gyro (DG) mode.  In the slaved mode, the aircraft magnetic heading is displayed beneath the top index or lubber line.  In the non-slaved DG mode, the compass card serves as a heading reference after being corrected to a known heading.  The  card is  manually corrected for the DG mode by  a switch on the compass control panel. 3.2.4.4.  Heading Marker.  The heading marker, if incorporated, may be positioned on the compass card by use of the heading set knob.  Once positioned, the marker remains on a fixed  heading.    To  maintain  the  selected  heading,  turn  to  place  the  heading  marker beneath the upper lubber line. 3.2.4.5.  Bearing  Pointers.    The  bearing  pointers  indicate  the  magnetic  bearing  to  the selected  ADF,  VOR,  or  TACAN  station.    Placards  on  the  instrument  or  near  a  selector switch are used in most aircraft to identify the bearing pointer display. 3.2.4.5.1.  NOTE:  When  tuned  to  an  ILS  frequency,  bearing  pointers  will  normally slave to a position 45 or 90 degrees from the upper lubber line.  Refer to flight manual for details. 3.2.4.6.  Malfunctions.  If there is a malfunction in the compass system or compass card, an  ADF  bearing  pointer  continues  to  point  to  the  station  and  displays  relative  bearing only.   TACAN/VOR pointers may continue to indicate proper magnetic bearings.  Until verified  by  radar  or  other  navigation  equipment,  consider  this  bearing  information unreliable. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   35  3.3.  Flight  Director.  The  flight  director  provides  the  pilot  with  displays  of  pitch  and  bank attitudes  and  the  navigation  situation  of  the  aircraft.    The  flight  director,  when  combined  with round dial performance instruments, is termed the flight director system (FDS).  When the flight director is combined with vertical scale instruments it is termed the integrated flight instrument system  (IFIS).    The  three  components  of  the  flight  director  of  major  interest  are  the  attitude director  indicator  (ADI),  the  horizontal  situation  indicator  (HSI),  and  the  flight  director computer. Figure 3.3.  Typical Flight Director. 3.3.1.  Attitude Director Indicator (ADI) (Figures 3.3 and 3.4).  3.3.1.1.  Parts  of  Attitude  Director  Indicator.    The  ADI  usually  consists  of  an  attitude indicator, rate of turn and slip indications, glide slope indicator, command bars, attitude warning flag, glide slope warning flag, and course warning flag.  Additional information displayed  on  some  ADIs  includes  radar  altitude  information,  approach  speed  deviation, and a runway symbol that displays lateral and vertical displacement from the runway. 3.3.1.1.1.  Glide  Slope  Pointer.    The  glide  slope  pointer  (GSP)  displays  glide  slope position in relation to the aircraft.  If the GSP is above or below center the glide slope is  above  or  below  the  aircraft  respectively.    GSP  scale  deflection  differs  with  the width of the glide slope (1° to 1.8°).  Example: If the glide slope width was 1°, full-scale deflection would be ½° and each dot would be ¼° (Figure 3.3).   36  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 Figure 3.4.  ADI and HSI.  3.3.1.1.2.  Command  Bars.    The  command  bars  display  steering  information  to intercept  or  maintain  a  desired  flight  path.    To  utilize  the  steering  function,  simply ―fly‖  the  ADI‘s  aircraft  symbol  by  adjusting  the  aircraft  attitude  until  it  is  snugly aligned  beneath  the  command  bars.    The  bars  will  command  the  proper  pitch  and bank to turn, intercept, and maintain a course and altitude. 3.3.1.1.2.1.  NOTE:  Warning flags are incorporated in the ADI to indicate failure or  unreliability  of  presentations.    Check  the  aircraft  flight  manual  for  specific warning  flags  applicable  to  your  aircraft.    In  some  ADIs,  if  power  fails  to  the pitch and bank steering bars, no warning flags will appear, and the pitch and bank steering  bars  will  center.    Monitor  the  identifier  to  ensure  that  the  signal  is reliable.    In  most  aircraft  a  warning  flag  appears  when  the  signal  strength  is insufficient. 3.3.2.  Horizontal  Situation  Indicator (HSI)  (Figures 3.3 and 3.4).   The horizontal situation indicator  combines  the  heading  indicator,  RMI,  CI,  and  range  indicator  into  one  display.  (See explanations of these functions in previous sections of this chapter.)  Additional features available on electronic HSIs include arc formats to display a segment of the standard display as well as map formats used to pictorially display aircraft position in relation to NAVAIDS or waypoints.  (Figure 3.5.) AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   37  Figure 3.5.  Electronic HIS.  3.3.2.1.  Course Selector Knob.  The course selector knob on most HSI‘s may be used to select  any  course  by  rotating  the  head  of  the  course  arrow  to  the  desired  course  on  the compass card. Check the course selector window for the proper setting. 3.3.2.2.  Heading Set Knob.  The heading set knob moves the heading marker to a desired heading.  With the proper mode selected on the flight director control panel, the heading marker  can  be  slaved  to  the  flight  director  computer.    Thus,  when  a  heading  is  set,  the command  bars  will  command  the  bank  attitude  required  to  turn  to  and  maintain  the selected heading. 3.3.3.  Flight  Director  Computer.      The  flight  director  computer  receives  navigation information  from  the  navigation  systems  and  attitude  information  from  the  attitude  gyro.  Depending  on  the  modes  available  and  selected,  the  computer  supplies  pitch  or  bank commands  to  the  command  bars  of  the  ADI.    The  command  bars  can  be  used  for  many functions such as intercepting VOR, TACAN, and Doppler courses or performing data link intercepts.  Pitch command information can vary from terrain avoidance to flying a glidepath or changing altitudes.  In all cases, the command bars display command information and do not  reflect  actual  aircraft  position.    Refer  to  the  appropriate  flight  manual  for  the  specific capabilities of the system installed in your aircraft. 3.3.4.  Flight Director Modes. 3.3.4.1.  Heading Mode.  The flight director will sync the command bars to the heading marker to keep the aircraft on the selected heading. 3.3.4.2.  ILS Intercept Mode. The flight director will cause the command bars to steer the aircraft onto and maintain the ILS course selected in the navigation radios. 3.3.4.2.1.  Wind drift.  Some computers supply wind drift compensation.   38  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 3.3.4.2.2.  Bank  angle.    Maximum  bank  angle  commanded  is  usually  25°  to  35°, depending on the system. 3.3.4.2.3.  Intercept  angle.  Maximum  intercept  angle  commanded is  normally about 45°. 3.3.4.2.4.  ILS Final Approach Mode.  Adds pitch inputs to the command bars to fly to  and  maintain  the  glideslope.  In  this  mode,  commanded  bank  angle  is  normally limited to a maximum of 15° and maximum pitch attitude commanded is 10° to 17°, depending on the system. 3.4.  Flight  Management  System  (FMS).  Many  newer  aircraft  are  equipped  with  an  FMS consisting of a Flight Management Computer (FMC), one or more Control Display Units (CDU), an  internal  navigation  database,  and  various  displays  and  annunciators  (Figure  3.6).    The  FMS utilizes  aircraft  sensors  and  navigation  database  information  to  compute  and  display  aircraft position,  performance  data,  and  navigation  information  during  all  phases  of  flight.    The  FMS may  interface  and  provide  guidance  commands  to  autopilot,  flight  director,  and  auto-throttle systems. Figure 3.6.  Typical Flight Management System.  3.4.1.  Flight  Management  Computer.    The  FMC  gathers  aircraft  position  information  from multiple  onboard  sensors  and  navigation  aids  including  VOR,  DME,  TACAN,  Inertial Reference  Systems  (IRS),  Inertial  Navigation  Systems  (INS),  Global  Positioning  System (GPS),  and  Air  Data  Computers.        Using  this  aircraft  position  information,  navigation functions  such  as  course  and  distance  to  a  waypoint,  desired  track,  groundspeed,  and estimated  time  of  arrival  are  computed  and  displayed  on  the  CDU  and  other  aircraft instruments.  Additionally, fuel flow information may be used by the FMC to calculate and update fuel consumption, specific range, and fuel overhead destination information. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   39  3.4.2.  Control Display Unit.  The CDU allows the aircrew to interface with the FMC.  The CDU normally consists of a display screen, data entry pad, and function and line select keys.  The  CDU  allows  menu-driven  selection  of  various  FMS  modes,  such  as  initialization,  fuel planning,  performance,  and  navigation.    The  pilot  may  input  flight  plan  route  and  various other flight  parameters into the CDU to  enhance situational  awareness  and the navigational capabilities of the aircraft. 3.4.3.  Navigation Database.  An FMS normally contains an internal navigation database with either  regional  or  worldwide  coverage.    The  database  typically  includes  information  on navigation  aids,  airports,  runways,  waypoints,  routes,  airways,  intersections,  departures  and arrivals, and instrument approaches.  Aircrews may also store defined routes and waypoints in the database.  Navigation databases require periodic updates, normally on a 28-day cycle, to ensure data is current. 3.5.  Single  Medium  Displays.  A single medium display is a Head-Up Display (HUD), Head-Down  Display  (HDD),  or  Helmet-Mounted  Display  (HMD)  (Figure  3.7).    These  systems  can display  control,  performance,  and  navigation  data  in  the  pilot‘s  outside  field  of  view,  enabling him  to  clear  and  monitor  instruments  simultaneously.    Information  received  from  HUD equipment that is not certified for sole-reference instrument flight by HQ USAF/A3O must be verified with other cockpit indications. Figure 3.7.  Helmet Mounted Display.  3.5.1.  Some single medium displays have the ability to project a Flight Path Marker (FPM) to  display  vector  flight  paths.    This  projection  gives  a  predictive  line  that  shows  where  the aircraft is going based on current flight parameters.  On HUDs the FPM can be used to plan terrain  clearance  maneuvers  on  low  levels,  determine  where  the  aircraft  will  touch  down when  landing,  etc.    Drawbacks  to  the  FPM  include  the  tendency  of  the  display  to  float around,  especially  in  crosswinds,  the  bobbing  motion  of  the  FPM  as  it  lags  behind  the movement  of  the  nose  of  the  aircraft,  and  the  degraded  usefulness  of  the  FPM  when  it exceeds the limits of the instrument's field-of-view at high angles of attack and in large drift or yaw situations. 3.5.2.  More  advanced  displays  use  a  Climb/Dive  Marker  (CDM)  as  the  command  flight symbol for vector flying.  The CDM will utilize the concept of the above FPM and flight path scale,  but  both  will  be  caged  to  the  center  of  the  display  to  prevent  the  symbology  from drifting off the usable area of the instrument.   40  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 Chapter 4 NAVIGATION AIDS 4.1.  Precautions.  Various  types  of  navigation  aids  are  in  use  today,  each  serving  a  special purpose.    Although  operating  principles  and  cockpit  displays  will  vary  among  navigation systems,  there  are  several  precautionary  actions  that  must  be  taken  to  prevent  in-flight  use  of erroneous navigation signals: 4.1.1.  Identification.    The  pilot  will  check  the  identification  of  any  navigation  aid  and monitor it during flight IAW Chapter 7 of this manual. 4.1.2.  Crosscheck  Information.    Use  all  suitable  navigation  equipment  aboard  the  aircraft and crosscheck heading and bearing information. 4.1.3.  Estimated Time of Arrival.  Never overfly an estimated time of arrival (ETA) without a careful crosscheck of navigation aids and ground checkpoints. 4.1.4.  Notices  to  Airmen.    The  pilot  will  check  notices  to  airmen  (NOTAM)  and  flight information  publication  (FLIP)  before  flight  for  possible  malfunctions  or  limitations  to navigation aids. 4.1.5.  Suspect Navigation Aid.  Discontinue use of any suspect navigation aid and confirm aircraft  position  with  radar  (ground  or  airborne)  or  other  equipment.    Advise  ATC  of  any problems receiving NAVAIDs.  The problem may be the ground station and not the aircraft equipment. 4.2.  VHF  Omni-Directional  Range  (VOR).  The  theoretical  and  technical  principles  of operation of VOR equipment are discussed in depth in AFMAN 11-217V3. 4.3.  Tactical  Air  Navigation  (TACAN).  The theoretical  and technical  principles of operation of TACAN equipment differ from those of VOR; however, the end result, as far as reading the cockpit display  is concerned, is the same. TACAN components and operation are discussed in depth in AFMAN 11-217V3. 4.4.  VHF  Omni-Directional  Range/Tactical  Air  Navigation  (VORTAC).  A  VORTAC  is  a unified navigation aid consisting of two  components,  VOR and TACAN, which provides three individual  services:  VOR  azimuth,  TACAN  azimuth,  and  TACAN  distance  (DME)  from  one site.  Both components of a VORTAC operate simultaneously and provide the three services at all times.  Additional information on VORTACs is available in AFMAN 11-217V3. (DME).  DME  operation  utilizes  paired  pulses 4.5.  Distance  Measuring  Equipment transmitted from  the aircraft to  a ground station at  a specific spacing.  The ground station then transmits  paired  pulses  back  to  the  aircraft  at  the  same  pulse  spacing  but  on  a  different frequency.    The  time  required  for  the  round  trip  of  this  signal  exchange  is  measured  in  the airborne DME unit and is displayed to the pilot as a distance in nautical miles from the aircraft to the ground station. Additional information on DME is available in AFMAN 11-217V3. 4.6.  Instrument  Landing  System  (ILS).  The theoretical and technical  principles of operation of ILS equipment are discussed in depth in AFMAN 11-217V3. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   41  4.6.1.  The ILS is designed to provide an approach path for exact alignment and descent of an aircraft  on  final  approach  to  a  runway.    The  ground  equipment  consists  of  two  highly directional  transmitting  systems,  optional  DME  transmitters,  and  as  many  as  three  marker beacons  or  compass  locators.    The  directional  transmitters  are  known  as  the  localizer  and glide  slope  which  are  received  by  aircraft  ILS  equipment  and  displayed  on  the  cockpit instrument  panel.    A  runway  serviced  by  ILS  equipment  will  also  include  approach, touchdown, and sometimes centerline lighting systems.  Figure 4.1 offers a visual depiction of a standard ILS configuration. 4.6.2.  ILS  System  on  Each  End  of  Runway.    Some  locations  have  a  complete  ILS  system installed  on  opposite  ends  of  a  runway.    Such  ILS  systems  should  not  be  operating simultaneously.    In  most  cases,  each  ILS  will  have  its  own  frequency.    Sometimes  the frequency for both runways will be the same, however each runway will have its own unique Morse code identifier. 4.6.2.1.  WARNING:  The pilot shall listen to the Morse code identifier or monitor the alphanumeric display IAW Chapter  7, especially when flying an ILS where the same frequency  is  used  for  two  runways.    If  both  ILSs  are  inadvertently  left  on,  or  the incorrect  ILS  is  turned  on,  it  is  possible  to  receive  back  course  and  false  glide  slope indications. 4.6.3.  False Course Indications.  False course indications may be received when the aircraft is not within the depicted area of coverage.  Therefore, localizer course information received outside the area depicted in Figure 4.2 should be considered invalid unless the procedure is published  otherwise  (for  example,  localizer  type  directional  aid  or  back  course  localizer).  There  is  also  a  remote  chance  electromagnetic  interference  may  cause  false  course indications within the depicted area of coverage.  For these reasons, it is essential to confirm the  localizer  on  course  indication  by  reference  to  aircraft  heading  and  any  other  available navigation  aids,  such  as  an  ADF  bearing  pointer,  before  commencing  final  descent.    Any abnormal  indications  experienced  within  35  degrees  of  the  published  front  course  or  back course centerline of an ILS localizer should be reported immediately to the appropriate ATC facility. 4.6.4.  False Glideslope Indications.  False glideslope indications may be received when the aircraft  is  not  within  the  depicted  area  of  coverage,  or  the  glide  slope  power  status  is  in alarm.  There is  also  a chance that aircraft or vehicles parked in  the  ILS Critical  Area may interfere  with  the  glideslope  signal.    For  these  reasons,  it  is  essential  to  confirm  glideslope intercept altitudes and expected altitudes as depicted on the IAP.  If indications are suspect, transition to localizer procedures or execute a missed approach. 4.6.5.  ILS Facilities with Associated DME.  ILS facilities sometimes have associated DME.  These  facilities  are  usually  found  at  civilian  fields.    Some  instrument  approach  procedures require TACAN or VOR associated DME on the initial segment and the ILS associated DME during the final portion of the approach.  Pilots must exercise extreme caution to ensure the proper DME channel is tuned to preclude premature or late descents.   42  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 Figure 4.1.  Standard ILS Characteristics and Terminology.  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   43  Figure 4.2.  Normal Localizer Signal Coverage.  4.7.  Microwave Landing System (MLS).  The MLS provides precision navigation guidance for exact  aircraft  alignment  and  descent  during  an  approach  to  a  selected  runway.  It  integrates azimuth  (AZ),  elevation  angle  (EL),  and  range  (DME)  information  to  provide  precise  aircraft positioning. The components of an MLS are similar to an ILS. Instead of a glide slope antenna, the  MLS  has  an  elevation  station,  and  instead  of  a  localizer  antenna,  it  has  an  azimuth  station. The MLS also  has a precision DME (DME/P) transmitter. The DME/P signal  is  more  accurate than traditional DME.  Additional information on MLS is available in AFMAN 11-217V3. 4.8.  Marker  Beacon  (Figure  4  1).    Marker  beacons  are  discussed  in  depth  in  AFMAN  11-217V3. 4.9.  Localizer Type Directional Aid (LDA).  The LDA is of comparable utility and accuracy to a  localizer  but  is  not  always  aligned  with  the  centerline  of  the  runway.  TERPS  requires  the Localizer (LOC) signal alignment within 3° of the runway alignment.  If the alignment exceeds 3°, the LOC will be identified as an LDA.  Once designated as an LDA, the maximum angle of convergence of the final approach course and the extended runway centerline is 30°.  The signal accuracy of the LDA is the same as a LOC, however the LDA course alignment will be greater than 3°, not to exceed 30°.  Straight-in minima can be published only where alignment conforms to the straight-in criteria specified in AFMAN 11-226 (TERPS).  Circling minima are published where this alignment exceeds straight-in criteria.  The LDA is usually considered a non-precision approach; however, in some installations with a glide slope, a decision altitude will be published.  If a decision altitude is published, it can be flown just like an ILS approach. 4.9.1.  Localizer (LLZ).  In International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Procedures for Air  Navigation  Services-Aircraft  Operations  (PANS-OPS)  abbreviates  the  localizer  facility as LLZ.  The accuracy of the signal generated by the LLZ is the same as a LOC.  PANS-OPS normally requires the LLZ final approach track alignment to remain within 5° of the runway centerline.  However, in certain cases, the alignment can exceed 5°.  Where required, PANS-OPS  allows  an  increase  of  the  final  approach  track  to  15°  for  categories  C,  D,  and  E.    For aircraft categories A and B, the maximum angle formed by the final approach track and the runway centerline is 30°.   44  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 4.9.1.1.  NOTE:  Prior to flying a LDA or LLZ, compare the final approach course with the  runway  heading.    The  aerodrome  sketch  should  provide  a  visual  indication  of  the angle formed between the final approach track and the runway centerline. Figure 4.3.  LDA With Glide Slope.  4.10.  Simplified Directional Facility (SDF).  The SDF provides a final approach course that is similar  to  that  of  the  ILS  localizer  and  LDA.  The  SDF  transmits  signals  within  the  range  of 108.10 MHz to 111.95 MHz.  However, the SDF may have a wider course width of 6° or 12°. It does not provide glide slope information.  For the pilot, the approach techniques and procedures used in the performance of an SDF instrument approach are essentially identical to those used in executing  a  standard  no  glide  slope  localizer  approach  except  that  the  SDF  course  may  not  be aligned with the runway and the course may be wider, resulting in less precision. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   45  Figure 4.4.  SDF Approach. 4.11.  Nondirectional Radio Beacon (NDB).  4.11.1.  Frequencies.    NDB  is  a  low,  or  medium,  or  ultra  high  frequency  radio  beacon  that transmits  nondirectional  signals  whereby  an  aircraft  properly  equipped  can  automatically determine and display bearing to any radio station within its frequency and sensitivity range. 4.11.2.  Compass Locator.  When a radio beacon is used in conjunction with the ILS markers, it  is  called  a  "compass  locator."    Sometimes  the  low-powered  NDB  [i.e.  compass  locator] will  be  a  stand  alone  NAVAID  with  limited  range  (usually  less  than  15  miles).    These locators may be identified by an ―L‖ and the use of the two-digit identifier. 4.11.3.  Identification.  Most radio beacons within the U.S. transmit a continuous three-letter identifier.  A two-letter identifier is normally used in conjunction with an ILS.  Some NDBs have  only  a  one-letter  identifier.    Outside  of  the  contiguous  U.S.,  one,  two,  or  three-letter identifiers are transmitted; for example, BB.   46  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 4.11.4.  Voice Transmissions.  Voice transmissions can be made on radio beacons unless the letter "W" (without voice) is included in the class designator (HW). 4.11.5.  Disturbances.  Radio beacons are subject to disturbances that may result in erroneous bearing  information.    Such  disturbances  result  from  intermittent  or  unpredictable  signal propagation due to such factors as lightning, precipitation, static, etc.  At night, radio beacons are  vulnerable  to  interference  from  distant  stations.    Nearly  all  disturbances  that  affect  the ADF bearing also affect the facility's identification.  Noisy identification usually occurs when the  ADF  needle  is  erratic.    Voice,  music,  or  erroneous  identification  will  usually  be  heard when a steady false bearing is being displayed. 4.11.5.1.  WARNING:    Since  ADF  receivers  do  not  have  a  "flag"  to  warn  the  pilot when  erroneous  bearing  information  is  being  displayed,  the  pilot  must  continuously monitor the NDBs identification. 4.12.  Global Positioning System (GPS). 4.12.1.  Principles  of  Operation.    GPS  is  a  satellite-based  navigation  system  that  has  the capability  to  provide  highly  accurate  three-dimensional  position,  velocity,  and  time  to  an infinite  number  of  equipped  users  anywhere  on  or  near  the  Earth  (Figure  4.5).        GPS  is discussed in depth in AFMAN 11-217V3. Figure 4.5.  GPS. 4.13.  Inertial Navigation System (INS).  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   47  4.13.1.  Description.  The INS is a source of groundspeed, attitude, heading, and navigation information.  A basic system consists of acceleration sensors mounted on a gyro stabilized, gimbaled platform, a computer unit to process raw data and maintain present position, and a control display unit (CDU) for data input and monitoring.  It allows the aircrew to selectively monitor  a  wide  range  of  data,  define  a  series  of  courses,  and  update  present  position.    The INS operates solely by sensing the movement of the aircraft.  Since it neither transmits nor receives  any  signal,  it  is  unaffected  by  electronic  countermeasures  or  weather  conditions.  The INS can also supply data to many other aircraft systems. 4.13.2.  Operation.    Before  an  INS  can  be  used,  it  must  be  aligned.    During  alignment, present position coordinates are inserted manually while the INS derives local level and true north.  This operation must be completed before moving the aircraft.  If alignment is lost in flight, navigation data may be lost, but, in some cases, attitude and heading information may still be used.  Coordinate or radial and distance information describing points that define the route of flight are inserted as needed through the CDU.  For complete operation procedures of any specific INS, consult the appropriate aircraft technical order.   48  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 Chapter 5 NAVIGATION TECHNIQUES AND PROCEDURES 5.1.  Application.  Instrument  procedures  are  flown  using  a  combination  of  techniques  (arc  to radial,  radial  to  arc,  course  intercepts,  etc.).    Individual  aircraft  flight  manuals  should  provide proper procedures for using the navigation equipment installed. 5.1.1.  Where procedures depict a ground track, the pilot is expected to correct for known wind conditions.  In general, the only time wind correction should not be applied is during radar vectors.  The following general procedures apply to all aircraft. 5.1.1.1.  Unless  otherwise  authorized  by  ATC  (or  as  necessary  for  safety  if  ATC coordination is not possible), no person may operate an aircraft within controlled airspace under IFR except as follows: 5.1.1.1.1.  On a Federal airway, along the centerline of that airway. 5.1.1.1.2.  Along the direct course between navigational aids or fixes defining a route. 5.1.2.  Utilizing ground based NAVAIDS. 5.1.2.1.  Tune  and  Identify.  The  pilot  will  tune  or  select  the  desired  frequency  or channel,  then  positively  identify  the  selected  station  via  an  aural  (Morse  Code)  or visual (alphanumeric) signal. the  capability 5.1.2.1.1.  For  aircraft  with translate  Morse  code  station identification  into  an  alphanumeric  visual  display,  it  is  acceptable  to  use  the  visual display  as  the  sole  means  of  identifying  the  station  identification  provided:  (MAJCOMs  will  determine  which  aircraft  can  use  this  method  for  identifying NAVAIDS.) to 5.1.2.1.1.1.  The alphanumeric visual display must always be in view of the pilot. 5.1.2.1.1.2.  Loss  of  the  Morse  code  station  identification  will  cause  the alphanumeric  visual  display  to  immediately  disappear,  or  a  warning  to  be displayed. 5.1.2.1.1.2.1.  WARNING:   It  is  imperative that crews are cognizant  of what station  identification  is  being  displayed.    For  example,  if  the  station identification  being  displayed  is  from  the  DME  portion  of  a  VOR/DME station,  then  only  the  DME  alphanumeric  display  may  be  used.    The  VOR azimuth station must still be identified aurally. 5.1.2.1.1.2.2.  WARNING:  Voice  communication  is  possible  on  VOR,  ILS, and ADF frequencies.  The only positive method of identifying a station is by its  Morse  code  identifier  (either  aurally  or  alphanumeric  display)  or  (for VORs)  the  recorded  automatic  voice  identification,  indicated  by  the  word ―VOR‖  following  the  station  name.    Identifying  a  NAVAID  by  listening  to other  voice  transmissions  broadcast  on  a  Flight  Service  Station  or  other facility  is not a reliable method of station identification and shall not be used. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   49  5.1.2.1.2.  VOR.  The station identification may be a repeated three-letter Morse code group, or a three-letter Morse code group alternating with a recorded voice identifier. 5.1.2.1.3.  TACAN.    The  TACAN  station  transmits  an  aural  three-letter  Morse  code identifier approximately every 35 seconds. 5.1.2.1.4.  NDB/ADF.    The  nondirectional  radio  beacon  transmits  a  repeated  two  or three-letter Morse code group depending on power output. 5.1.2.1.5.  ILS.    The  ILS  localizer  transmitter  puts  out  a  repeated  four-letter  Morse code  group.    In  the  US,  the  first  letter  of  the  identifier  is  always  "I"  to  denote  the facility as an ILS. 5.1.3.  Monitor.  The  pilot  will  monitor  station  identification  (either  aural  or  visual  as applicable)  to  ensure  a  reliable  signal  is  being  transmitted.    Removal  of  identification serves as a warning to pilots that the facility is officially off the air for tune-up or repairs and may be unreliable even though intermittent or constant signals are received.  The navigation signal  must  be  considered  unreliable  when  the  station  identifier  is  not  being  received.    For NDBs, there is a direct correlation between the strength of the identifier and the strength and reliability of the signal with no off flags to indicate loss of signal.  Therefore, on approaches that require an NDB, pilots will monitor the NDB identifier for the entire approach. 5.1.4.  Select.  The pilot will select proper position for the navigation system switches. 5.1.5.  Set.  The pilot will set the selector switches to display the desired information on the navigation instruments. 5.1.6.  Check.  The  pilot  will  check  the  appropriate  instrument  indicators  for  proper operation. 5.2.  Homing to a Station (Figure  5  1).  Homing occurs when the pilot places the head of the bearing pointer under the upper lubber line (or Top Index) and makes periodic heading changes to  keep  it  there.    Failure  to  apply  wind  drift  corrections  results  in  a  curved  flight  path  to  the station.   50  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 Figure 5.1.  Curved Flight Path as a Result of Homing with a Crosswind.  5.3.  Proceeding  Direct  to  a  Station.  Turn  the  aircraft  in  the  shorter  direction  to  place  the head of the bearing pointer under the top index or upper lubber line.  Center the CDI with a TO indication (N/A RMI only) and apply wind drift corrections to maintain the selected course to the station. 5.3.1.  If either the compass card or the bearing pointer is inoperative, a course indicator or HSI may be used to determine the bearing to the station by rotating the course set knob until the CDI centers and ―TO‖ is read in the ―TO-FROM‖ indicator.  The magnetic bearing from the aircraft to the station then appears in the course selector window.  Pilots will attempt to verify bearing information by any other means available before considering it reliable. 5.4.  Course Intercepts. 5.4.1.  Successful  Course  Interception.    Course  interceptions  are  performed  in  many  phases of  instrument  navigation.    To  ensure  successful  course  interception,  an  intercept  heading must be used that results in an angle or rate of intercept sufficient to complete a particular intercept problem. 5.4.1.1.  Intercept  Heading.    The  intercept  heading  (aircraft  heading)  is  the  heading determined  to  solve  an  intercept  problem.    When  selecting  an  intercept  heading,  the essential  factor  is  the  relationship  between  distance  from  the  station  and  the  number  of AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   51  degrees  the  aircraft  is  displaced  from  the  course.    Adjustments  to  the  intercept  heading may be necessary to achieve a more desirable rate of intercept. 5.4.1.1.1.  A technique for determining intercept headings is: 5.4.1.1.1.1.  Inbound:  From the desired course, look in the shorter direction to the head of the bearing pointer.  Continue beyond the head of the bearing pointer by 30 degrees or the number of degrees off course, whichever is less.  This will give a  recommended  intercept  angle  of  30  degrees  or  less.    Any  heading  beyond  the bearing pointer, within 90° of the desired inbound course, is a no-wind intercept heading. 5.4.1.1.1.2.  Outbound:  From the tail of the bearing pointer, move in the shorter direction to the desired course.  Continue beyond the course by 45 degrees, or the number of degrees off course, whichever is less.  This will give the recommended intercept  angle  of  45  degrees  or  less.    Any  heading  beyond  the  desired  course, within 90°, is a no-wind intercept heading. 5.4.1.2.  Angle of Intercept.  The angle of intercept is the angular difference between the heading  of  the  aircraft  (intercept  heading)  and  the  desired  course.    The  minimum acceptable angle of intercept for an inbound course interception must be greater than the number  of  degrees  the  aircraft  is  displaced  from  the  desired  course.    The  angle  of intercept should not exceed 90°. 5.4.1.3.  Rate  of  Intercept.    The  rate  of  intercept  is  determined  by  observing  bearing pointer  and  CDI  movement.    The  rate  of  intercept  is  a  result  of  intercept  angle, groundspeed, distance from the station, and if you are proceeding to or from the station. 5.4.1.4.  Completing the Intercept. 5.4.1.4.1.  Lead  point.    A  lead  point  to  roll  out  on  the  course  must  be  determined because  of  turn  radius  of  the  aircraft.    The  lead  point  is  determined  by  comparing bearing pointer or CDI movement with the time required to turn to course.  Refer to AFMAN 11-217V3 for techniques to determine a lead point. 5.4.1.4.2.  Rate of intercept.   To determine the rate of intercept,  monitor the bearing pointer or CDI movement. 5.4.1.4.3.  Turn.    The  time  required  to  make  the  turn  to  course  is  determined  by  the intercept angle and the aircraft turn rate. 5.4.1.4.4.  Complete the intercept.   Use the CDI,  when available,  for completing the course intercept. 5.4.1.4.5.  Undershoot or Overshoot.  If it is obvious that the selected lead point will result in undershooting the desired course, either reduce the angle of bank or roll out of the turn and resume the intercept.  If the selected lead point results in an overshoot, continue the turn and roll out with a correction back to the course. 5.4.1.4.6.  Maintain  course.    The  aircraft  is  considered  to  be  maintaining  the  course centerline  when  the  CDI  is  centered  or  the  bearing  pointer  points  to  the  desired course.  A correction for known winds should be applied when completing the turn to a course.   52  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 5.4.1.4.7.  NOTE:  Pilots should always attempt to fly as close to the course centerline as  possible.    TERPS  design  criteria  will  provide  maximum  obstacle  clearance protection when the course centerline is maintained. 5.4.2.  In-bound (HSI, CI and RMI) (Figure 5.2). 5.4.2.1.  Tune and identify the station. 5.4.2.2.  Set  inbound  course.  Set  the  desired  inbound  course  in  the  course  selector window and check for a TO indication. 5.4.2.3.  Turn.  Turn to an intercept heading. 5.4.2.3.1.  CI  and  RMI.    Turn  in  the  shorter  direction  to  place  the  heading  pointer toward the CDI.  Continue the turn to place the heading pointer in the top half of the instrument case.  This precludes an intercept angle in excess of 90°.  Roll out with the RMI/BDHI bearing pointer between the desired inbound course and top index.  The angle  of  intercept  must  be  greater  than  the  number  of  degrees  off  course,  not  to exceed 90°.  The intercept heading may be adjusted within these limits to achieve the most  desirable  rate  of  intercept.    Displacing  the  bearing  pointer  approximately  30° from the top index will normally ensure a moderate rate of intercept. 5.4.2.3.2.  HSI.  Turn in the shorter direction toward the CDI.  The shorter direction is displayed by the aircraft symbol and CDI relationship.  Continue the turn to place the head  of  the  course  arrow  in  the  top  half  of  the  instrument  case.    This  precludes  an intercept  angle  in  excess  of  90°.    Roll  out  of  the  turn  when  the  bearing  pointer  is between  the  upper  lubber  line  and  the  head  of  the  course  arrow  to  establish  an intercept heading.  Displacing the bearing pointer 30° from the upper lubber line will normally ensure a moderate rate of intercept.   The aircraft symbol will appear to  be proceeding toward the CDI at  an intercept  angle  equal  to  the  angle  formed between the upper lubber line and the head of the course arrow.  The angle of intercept must be greater than the number of degrees off course, but not more than 90°. 5.4.2.4.  Maintain intercept.  Maintain the intercept heading until a lead point is reached, then  complete  the  intercept.    The  lead  point  depends  on  bearing  pointer  or  CDI  rate  of movement and the time required to turn on course. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   53  Figure 5.2.

Determine  an  intercept  heading.    Locate  the  desired inbound  course  on  the  compass  card.    From  the  desired  course,  look  in  the  shorter direction  to  the  head  of  the  bearing  pointer.    Any  heading  beyond  the  bearing  pointer, within  90°  of  the  desired  inbound  course,  is  a  no-wind  intercept  heading.    In  many   54  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 instances, an intercept heading selected 30° beyond the bearing pointer ensures a rate of intercept sufficient to solve the problem.  An intercept angle is formed when the head of the bearing pointer is between the desired course and the top index on the RMI. 5.4.3.3.  Turn.  Turn in the shorter direction to the intercept heading. 5.4.3.4.  Maintain intercept.  Maintain the intercept heading until a lead point is reached, then  complete  the  intercept.    Lead  point  depends  on  bearing  pointer  rate  of  movement and the time required to turn on course. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   55  Figure 5.3.

This  should  have  already been accomplished. 5.4.4.2.  Turn.  Turn in the shorter direction to a heading that will parallel or intercept the outbound course.  Turning to parallel the desired outbound course is always acceptable.  Continuing the turn to an intercept heading may be preferable when the bearing pointer is stabilized or when  you know your position in relation to the desired course.  The effect    56  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 that airspeed, wind, and magnitude of turn will have on aircraft position during the turn to an intercept heading should be considered. 5.4.4.3.  Set course.  Set the desired course in the course selector window and check for FROM indication. 5.4.4.4.  Turn to Intercept.  Turn to an intercept heading if not previously accomplished.  Determine the number of degrees off course as indicated by CDI displacement or angular difference  between  the  tail  of  the  bearing  pointer  and  the  desired  course.    If  the  initial turn was to parallel the desired course, turn toward the CDI to establish an intercept angle approximately  equal  to  the  number  of  degrees  off  course.    Normally,  to  avoid overshooting, an intercept angle greater than 45° should not be used. 5.4.4.5.  Maintain.  Maintain  the  intercept  heading  until  a  lead  point  is  reached,  then complete  the  intercept.    The  lead  point  depends  on  bearing  pointer  or  CDI  rate  of movement and the time required to turn on course. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   57  Figure 5.4.

Turn in the shorter direction to a heading that will parallel or intercept the outbound course.  Refer to paragraph 5.4.4 above (Outbound - Immediately After Station Passage (HSI and CI)). 5.4.5.2.1.  Degrees  Off  Course.    Determine  the  number  of  degrees  off  course.    Note the angular difference between the tail of the bearing pointer and the desired course. 5.4.5.3.  Intercept  Heading.  Determine an intercept  heading.  Determine  and turn to  an intercept heading if a suitable intercept angle was not established during the initial turn.  Look from the tail of the bearing pointer to the desired course.  Any heading beyond the desired  course  is  a  no-wind  intercept  heading.    Turn  in  this  direction  an  amount approximately  equal  to  the  number  of  degrees  off  course.    Normally,  to  avoid overshooting the course, do not use an intercept angle greater than 45°. 5.4.5.3.1.  Note:  On  some  aircraft,  the  RMI/BDHI  bearing  pointer  does  not  have  a tail.  In this case, turn to the magnetic heading of the desired course.  Continue on the outbound magnetic heading of the desired course until the bearing pointer stabilizes.  Note the number of degrees the bearing pointer is off the tail of the aircraft.  This is the  number  of  degrees  off  course.    Any  heading  change  in  the  direction  toward  the head of the bearing pointer is  a no-wind intercept  heading.  Turn in  the direction of the  head  of  the  bearing  pointer  an  amount  approximately  equal  to  the  number  of degrees  off  course.    Normally,  to  avoid  overshooting  the  course,  do  not  use  an intercept angle greater than 45°. 5.4.5.4.  Maintain.  Maintain  the  intercept  heading  until  a  lead  point  is  reached,  then complete the intercept.  The lead point depends on the bearing pointer rate of movement and the time required to turn on course. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   59  Figure 5.5.

Turn to an intercept heading: 5.4.6.3.1.  CI.    Turn  in  the  shorter  direction  to  place  the  heading  pointer  toward  the CDI.  Continue the turn to place the heading pointer in the top half of the instrument case and roll out on an intercept heading.  This precludes an intercept angle in excess of 90°.  Roll out  of the turn on an intercept  heading with  a suitable intercept  angle, normally  45°.    A  45°  intercept  angle  is  established  by  rolling  out  with  the  desired course  under  the  appropriate  45°  index,  or  with  the  heading  pointer  displaced  45° from the top index and toward the CDI. 5.4.6.3.2.  HSI.  Turn in the shorter direction toward the CDI.  Continue the turn until the head of the course arrow is in the top half of the instrument case.  This precludes an intercept angle in excess of 90°.  Roll out of the turn on an intercept heading with a suitable  angle  of  intercept,  normally  45°.    A  45°  intercept  angle  is  established  by rolling out with the head of the course arrow under the appropriate 45 ° index (aircraft symbol directed toward the CDI). 5.4.6.4.  Maintain.  Maintain  the  intercept  heading  until  a  lead  point  is  reached,  then complete  the  intercept.    The  lead  point  depends  on  the  bearing  pointer  or  CDI  rate  of movement and the time required to turn on course. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   61  Figure 5.6.

Tune and identify the station.  5.4.7.2.  Determine an intercept heading.  Look from the tail of the bearing pointer past the  desired  course  and  select  an  intercept  heading.    Any  heading  beyond  the  desired course,  within  90°,  is  a  no-wind  intercept  heading.    A  heading  selected  45°  beyond  the desired course will normally ensure a moderate rate of intercept. 5.4.7.2.1.  Note: On some aircraft, the RMI or BDHI bearing pointer does not have a tail.  In this case, turn the shorter direction to the outbound magnetic heading of the   62  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 desired course.  Note the number of degrees the bearing pointer is off the tail of the aircraft.    This  is  the  number  of  degrees  off  course.    Any  heading  change  in  the direction  toward  the  head  of  the  bearing  pointer  within  90°  is  a  no-wind  intercept heading.    A  turn  in  the  direction  of  the  head  of  the  bearing  pointer  of  45°  past  the desired course will normally ensure a moderate rate of intercept. 5.4.7.3.  Turn.  Turn in the shorter direction to the intercept heading. 5.4.7.4.  Maintain.  Maintain  the  intercept  heading  until  a  lead  point  is  reached,  then complete  the  intercept.

Outbound Course Interceptions-Away From the Station (RMI Only). 5.4.8.  Maintaining Course (Figure 5.8).  To maintain course, fly a heading estimated to keep the aircraft on the selected course.  If the CDI or bearing pointer indicates a deviation from the  desired  course,  return  to  course  avoiding  excessive  intercept  angles.    After  returning  to course, again  estimate the drift correction required to  keep the CDI  centered or the bearing pointer  pointing  to  the  desired  course.    (The  CDI  and  bearing  pointer  may  show  a  rapid movement  from  the  on-course  indication  when  close  to  the  station.    In  this  situation,  avoid    64  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 making  large  heading  changes  because  actual  course  deviation  is  probably  small  due  to proximity to the station).

Station  passage occurs when the TO-FROM indicator makes the first positive change to FROM.  For RMI/BDHI only, station passage is determined when the bearing pointer passes 90 degrees to the inbound course. 5.5.2.  TACAN.  Station passage occurs when the range indicator stops decreasing. 5.5.3.  ADF.    Station  passage  occurs  when  the  bearing  pointer  passes  90°  to  the  inbound course. 5.5.3.1.  NOTE: When established in an NDB holding pattern, subsequent station passage occurs at the first definite move by the bearing pointer through the 45° index on the RMI. 5.6.  Groundspeed  Check.  Groundspeed  checks  are  done  to  aid  in  calculating  ETAs  to  fixes, which are useful for position reports, fuel computations and other mission timing problems. 5.6.1.  Conditions.  A groundspeed check can be made while maintaining a course to or from a  TACAN/VORTAC  station.    As  a  guide,  however,  groundspeed  checks  should  be performed  only  when  the  aircraft  slant  range  distance  is  more  than  the  aircraft  altitude divided by  1,000.   For example, if the aircraft is at  FL 200,  groundspeed checks should be performed  when  beyond  20  nautical  miles.    Checks  made  below  5,000  feet  are  accurate  at any distance. 5.6.2.  Begin  Timing.    To  perform  the  groundspeed  check,  begin  timing  when  the  range indicator shows a whole number.  After the predetermined time has elapsed, check the range indicator  and  note  the  distance  flown.    Apply  the  following  formula  to  determine groundspeed:    Multiply  the  distance  flown  times  60  and  then  divide  the  product  by  the elapsed time in minutes.  For example, if you fly 12 NM in 2 minutes, then your groundspeed is 360 knots. ((12 NM x 60)/2 min = 360 knots) 5.6.2.1.  NOTE: For precise computation, time for longer periods and solve the problems on  a  computer.    To  simplify  computations,  use  a  2-minute  time  check  and  multiply  the distance  traveled  by  30,  a  3-minute  time  check,  distance  times  20;  or  a  6-minute  time check, distance times 10.  A rapid groundspeed check can be accomplished by timing the range indicator for 36 seconds and multiplying the distance traveled by 100.   66  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 Figure 5.9.  Arc Interception From a Radial. 5.7.  Arc/Radial  Intercepts.  TACAN  and  VOR/DME  arcs  are  used  during  many  phases  of flight.  Arcs are normally intercepted from radials (either inbound or outbound) and vice-versa, making  the  turn  from  one  to  the  other,  in  general,  90°  of  heading  change  .    Use  accurate  lead points and account for variations in aircraft turn radius due to winds to prevent excessive under or overshoots.  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   67  5.7.1.  Arc Interception from a Radial (Figure 5.9).  Tune and identify the NAVAID used for the  intercept  and  determine  the  direction  of  turn.    Using  aircraft  calculations  found  in AFMAN 11-217V3, determine the lead point necessary to intercept the arc.  When the lead point is reached, turn to place the bearing pointer on the 90° index. 5.7.1.1.  Corrections.  If the aircraft is outside of the desired arc, turn to place the bearing pointer slightly above the 90° index.  If inside, turn to place the bearing pointer slightly below  the  90°  index.    (Rule  of  Thumb:    Displace  the  bearing  pointer  5°  below  the reference point for each one-half mile deviation to the inside of the arc, and 10° above the reference point for each half mile outside the arc.) 5.7.1.2.  While  on  the  arc,  as  the  bearing  pointer  falls,  continue  to  make  small  turns  to keep  it  on  the  90°  index.    Alternatively,  a  series  of  short  straight  legs  may  be  flown allowing  the  bearing  pointer  to  fall  a  few  degrees  below  the  90°  index  then  turning  to place the bearing pointer a few degrees above the 90° index.  When using this technique, the  aircraft  will  fly  slightly  outside  and  inside  the  arc  alternatively  on  each  leg  (Figure 5.10).   68  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 Figure 5.10.

Radial Interception From an Arc.  5.8.  Proceeding Direct to a VOR/DME or TACAN Fix.  Proceeding directly to a radial/DME fix without RNAV equipment is not a normal form of navigation in the NAS.  It can, however, be a useful technique for backing up RNAV equipment or navigating in a loss of communication situation.  Bearing and range information from a VOR/DME or TACAN facility is sufficient for navigating direct to any fix within reception range. 5.8.1.  In  order  to  legally  conform  to  NAS  area  navigation  procedures  and  the  national route program (NRP) as outlined in FLIP GP chapter 4 and FAA AC 90-91, USAF pilots and  air  traffic  controllers  should  not  file,  give,  or  accept  a  clearance  (as  applicable)  that requires  an  aircraft  to  navigate  direct  to  a  radial/DME  fix  (perform  a  fix-to-fix)  except under the following circumstances:   70  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 5.8.1.1.  The primary navigation equipment onboard the aircraft is either area navigation (RNAV) or advanced RNAV capable and operating normally. 5.8.1.2.  Flight will be conducted where radar monitoring by air traffic control (ATC) is available. 5.8.1.3.  Locally  defined  arrival/departure  procedures  require  the  navigation  to/from  a radial-DME  fix  for  the  sequencing  of  aircraft.    Locally  defined  procedures  must  be evaluated by TERPS and flight checked if flown in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) and radar monitoring is not available. 5.8.1.4.  Operational  necessity  dictates  (i.e.  filing  and  flying  an  air  refueling  track)  or conforms to military enroute operations. 5.8.2.  When operating in the NAS and given a clearance to proceed to a radial/DME fix, unless  the  aircraft  capability  or  operations  meet  one  of  the  parameters  defined  above, pilots  should  reply  with  ―unable‖  and  state  the  appropriate  suffix  code  defined  in  FLIP GP  chapter  4.    Under  these  circumstances,  ATC  should  provide  navigation  guidance  to the radial/DME fix either via radar vectors or an alternate routing. 5.8.3.  The following are some techniques to accomplish a fix-to-fix (Figure 5.12.): 5.8.3.1.  Tune  the  TACAN  or  VOR/DME  equipment  (VOR  and  DME  stations  must  be collocated).  Then visualize the navigational situation on the HSI or RMI compass card.  The NAVAID will be represented by the center of the compass card.  The outer ring of the  compass  card  will  represent  the  greater  of  either  the  aircraft‘s  current  DME  or  the DME of the fix. 5.8.3.2.  Turn in  the shortest direction to  a heading somewhere between the head of the bearing pointer and the radial of the desired fix.  (Position B of Figure 5.12)  If the DME of  the  fix  is  greater  than  the  aircraft‘s  current  DME,  the  heading  will  be  closer  to  the desired  radial  and  vice-versa.    This  initial  heading  will  get  the  aircraft  moving  in  the general direction of the fix until the following procedures can fine-tune the heading. 5.8.3.3.  To  fine-tune  the  heading  to  the  desired  fix,  mentally  place  the  aircraft  and  the desired fix on their respective radials at the appropriate relative position from the center of the compass card (NAVAID).  Turn the aircraft until the line between these two points is parallel to a line from the center of the compass card and the upper lubber line with the two fix points vertically one above the other.  (Position C of Figure 5.12) 5.8.3.4.  Update  the  fix-to-fix  periodically  remembering  that  the  relative  size  of  the compass card will change as the airplane moves in relation to the NAVAID.  If the initial heading does not keep the aircraft moving toward the fix, there is probably a wind effect.  When making adjustments to the fix-to-fix heading, take this wind effect into account in the new heading. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   71  Figure 5.12.  Proceeding Direct to a DME Fix. 5.9.  Area Navigation.  (RNAV)  A method of navigation using a variety of onboard equipment including  Inertial  Navigation  System  (INS),  TACAN/VOR/DME-based  Flight  Management Systems (FMS), Integrated/Embedded GPS, DME/DME/IRU (if certified for IFR navigation) or LORAN-C  that  allows  the  pilot  to  fly  directly  to  predetermined  geographical  positions (waypoints)  or  define  routes  or  instrument  procedures  in  terms  of  latitude  and  longitude  or radial/distance relative to a ground based navigation facility.    72  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 5.9.1.  In order to be considered RNAV capable, an aircraft must be able to display a course from  a  given  point  (waypoint)  to  a  clearance  limit  while  also  providing  a  continuously updated aircraft position with reference to that course line.  An aircraft FMS, INS, LORAN, or  integrated  GPS  navigation  system  providing  course  guidance  to  the  aircrew  meets  this requirement.  Mission enhancement GPS systems do not meet this requirement. 5.9.2.  Aircraft  may  fly,  with  clearance,  on  either  random  or  designated  RNAV  routes.    A random  RNAV  route  proceeds  between  RNAV  waypoints  that  are  not  part  of  published airways.  Designated RNAV routes follow published and charted airways meant for RNAV capable  aircraft.    Whether  under  radar  control  or  not,  Pilots  shall  use  extreme  caution when flying random RNAV routes or accepting clearance to navigate via RNAV to a fix or point while below the minimum IFR altitude. 5.9.3.  Required Navigation Performance Type (RNP Type).  A value stating the navigation performance  of  the  aircraft  for  at  least  95  percent  of  the  total  flying  time.    The  value  is  a must-remain-within value and is typically expressed as a distance in (longitudinal and lateral) nautical miles (e.g.  RNP-5 airspace requires an aircraft to be within 5 miles of its intended position  95  percent  of  the  time).  In  addition  to  accuracy,  many  RNP  applications  impose functional  requirements.    Aircrew  must  comply  with  training,  certification,  and  equipment requirements  prior  to  flying  any  RNAV  procedure.    The  RNP  Type  can  be  found  either directly on the publication or in the legend for various navigational procedures (e.g. STARS, hi and low charts, approaches, etc.) 5.9.3.1.  En Route.  RNAV aircraft must be able to navigate on the intended RNP Type route  or  within  the  RNP  Type  airspace  using  their  onboard  navigation  equipment.  MAJCOMS  provide  operational  approval  for  each  type  of  RNP  airspace/procedure.  Operational  approval  ensures  that  RNAV  equipment  meets  accuracy  and  functional requirements,  and  that  appropriate  crew  training  and  procedures  are  in  place.    While airspace  requirements  vary  between  regions,  in  some  cases  backup  equipment (VOR/DME, TACAN, etc.) may be required to allow reversion to an alternate means of navigation should RNAV equipment fail. 5.9.3.2.  Terminal.   RNAV in  the terminal  area  consists of both  approach and departure procedures.  RNAV equipment may be used as the sole source of navigation information for instrument approaches in suitably equipped and certified aircraft.  RNAV approaches must be retrieved from an aircraft database and not be manually entered.  MAJCOMs certify  the  capabilities  of  their  aircraft  in  accordance  with  civil  standards  as  outlined  in various Technical Standard Order‘s (TSO) and Advisory Circular‘s (AC). 5.9.4.  Aircrew Responsibilities.  Although RNAV routes (including random routes) may be filed  at  any  time,  aircrews  should  have  alternate  routing  and  contingency  actions  planned.  ATC  considers  radar  coverage  capability  and  compatibility  with  traffic  flow  and  volume prior  to  assigning  random  RNAV  routes.    Although  ATC  provides  radar  separation  on RNAV routes in the national airspace system (NAS), navigation and collision avoidance on any RNAV route remains the responsibility of the aircrew. Aircrews must consider the limits of  RNAV  equipment  certification  prior  to  accepting  clearance  for  RNAV  routes  or  RNP airspace.    Aircrews  should  also  take  advantage  of  opportunities  to  update  the  navigation system  while  en  route.    In  addition,  crews  should  monitor  RNAV  equipment  performance AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   73  and  be  prepared  to  return  to  an  alternate  means  of  navigation  should  an  equipment malfunction require. 5.10.  GPS  Navigation.  The  ICAO  has  adopted  ―Global  Navigation  Satellite  System  (GNSS)‖ as an umbrella term to identify any satellite navigation system where the user performs onboard position  determination  from  satellite  information.    Currently  there  are  only  two  GNSS  systems that  are  recognized  by  the  International  Frequency  Registration  Board  (IFRB):    the  GPS developed  by  the  United  States  and  the  Global  Orbiting  Navigation  Satellite  System (GLONASS) now under development by the Federation of Russia. 5.10.1.  GPS Requirements for IFR navigation.  In order to be used for IFR navigation, GPS equipment must meet minimum functional requirements and comply with approved standards for  accuracy,  integrity,  availability,  and  continuity.    Compliance  with  FAA  TSOs  and  ACs are the primary means of ensuring these standards are met.  AFI 11-202V3, lists FAA TSOs and ACs applicable to GPS User Equipment (UE). 5.10.2.  GPS equipment properly certified and approved by the MAJCOM may be used as a primary  means  of  IFR  navigation.    Aircrews  will  comply  with  guidance  in  AFI  11-202V3 and aircraft flight manuals when utilizing GPS as a navigation solution. 5.10.2.1.  NOTE. GPS provides two levels of service: Standard Positioning Service (SPS) and Precise Positioning Service (PPS). SPS is based on the C/A data and provides, to all users, a horizontal and vertical signal-in-space positioning accuracy standard of 13 meters and  22  meters,  respectively,  with  a  probability  of  95  percent.    PPS  is  based  on  an encrypted  Precision  (P)  code  transmitted  over  two  frequencies  (L1  and  L2)  as  a  P  (Y) code  which  can  only  be  received  by  military  GPS  receivers  with  a  valid  crypto  key inserted and is accurate to within 9 meters.  Some countries do not allow the use of GPS (either  SPS  or  PPS)  for  IFR  navigation  in  their  sovereign  airspace.    Consult  the appropriate FLIP Area Planning (AP) document for details. 5.10.2.2.  NOTE.    IFR  navigation  using  PPS  GPS.    Without  host  nation  approval,  PPS may not be used for IFR navigation in civil airspace, including the US National Airspace System (NAS).   For discussion on GPS PPS, see AFMAN 11-217V3. 5.10.2.3.  Receiver  Autonomous  Integrity  Monitor  (RAIM).    The  GPS  receiver  verifies the  integrity    of  the  signals  received  from  the  GPS  constellation  through  RAIM  to determine if a satellite is  providing corrupted information.     Without RAIM capability, the  pilot  has  no  assurance  of  the  accuracy  of  the  GPS  position.    RAIM    (or  equivalent integrity method) is  required for use of GPS in IFR navigation and requires at least 5 satellites in view to check GPS integrity. 5.10.2.3.1.  NOTE:    Barometric  aiding  allows  RAIM  to  validate  GPS  integrity utilizing just 4 satellites in conjunction with the current altimeter setting entered in an approved barometric altimetry system. 5.10.2.3.2.  NOTE:  For sake of simplicity, this document will use the term RAIM to refer  to  all  acceptable  integrity  monitoring  methods.    The  procedures  and  guidance discussed are applicable to all approved integrity monitoring algorithms. 5.10.2.3.3.  RAIM  outages  may  occur  due  to  an  insufficient  number  of  satellites  or unsuitable  satellite  geometry.    Loss  of  satellite  reception  and  RAIM  warnings  may   74  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 occur due to aircraft dynamics (changes in pitch or bank angle).  Antenna location on the  aircraft,  satellite  position  relative  to  the  horizon,  and  aircraft  attitude  may  affect reception of one or more satellites. 5.10.2.3.3.1.  RAIM  Alerts.    There  are  two  types  of  RAIM  alerts.    One  type indicates that not enough satellites are in view (or in an insufficient geometry) to provide RAIM.  The other type indicates that the RAIM has detected a potential error that exceeds the limits (enroute, terminal, or approach) for the current phase of flight. 5.10.2.3.3.2.  Predictive  RAIM  forecasts  RAIM  availability  at  a  particular location  at  a  time  in  the  future.    To  effectively  check  predictive  RAIM,  aircraft avionics  must  allow  deselection  of  satellites  based  on  NOTAM  information.  Predictive  RAIM  must  be  checked  prior  to  the  mission  or  the  flight  segment where GPS is required. 5.10.2.3.3.2.1.  A predictive RAIM check is not required on aircraft approved for RNP RNAV operations by the aircraft flight manual.  Prior to flying RNP RNAV  procedures,  aircrew  must  ensure  that  the  appropriate  level  of  RNP will  be  available  to  fly  a  given  procedure.    This  may  or  may  not  require  a predictive  RAIM  check.    Details  on  methods  to  confirm  RNP  RNAV availability are detailed in the aircraft flight manual. 5.10.2.3.3.2.2.  If  the  required    RAIM  level  (e.g.,  enroute,  terminal  or approach)  is  not  available,  another  type  of  navigation  and  approach  system must be used, another destination selected, or the trip delayed until the RAIM level is acceptable. 5.10.2.3.3.2.3.  Pilots should recheck the RAIM prediction for the destination during  the  flight.    This  may  provide  early  indications  that  an  unscheduled satellite outage has occurred since takeoff and allow the pilot to determine an alternative course of action. if 5.10.2.3.3.2.4.  The  predictive  RAIM  check, required,  must  be accomplished  prior  to  the  intended  GPS  operation,  including  both  GPS departures and approaches, and may be accomplished either by onboard GPS equipment  or  via  a  ground  system.    The  predictive  RAIM  algorithm  should take into account satellites that are NOTAMed out of service between the time of  the  predictive  RAIM  check  and  the  flight  segment  over  which  GPS  is required.  Prior to deselecting satellites for predictive RAIM purposes, aircrew should ensure that deselecting would not affect use of the satellite in the active navigation  solution.    Some  systems  only  allow  deselecting  from  the  active navigation  solution  and  do  not  allow  deselecting  for  predictive  RAIM purposes. 5.10.2.3.3.2.5.  GPS  NOTAMs  may  be  obtained  by  entering  "KGPS"  as  the ―airfield‖    at  the  military  NOTAM  website.    Note  that  the  NOTAM  website refers to satellites using the PRN, not the SVN.  Most, if not all GPS avionics use  the  PRN  to  identify  satellites  to  be  deselected.    For  information  on  the correlation  between  a  particular  PRN  and  SVN,  consult  the  GPS  Support AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   75  Center web site. Station the RAIM or at information  may  be  obtained 5.10.2.3.3.2.6.  For  operations  in  the  US  NAS,  predictive  RAIM  information for  individual  destinations  may  be  obtained  by  contacting  an  FAA  Flight Service website (http://www.raimprediction.net) .  For operations within Europe, predictive RAIM the  AUGUR  website (http://augur.ecacnav.com/augur/app/home).    Additionally,  the  military also  provides  airfield-specific  GPS  RAIM  NOTAMs  for  non-precision approach procedures at military airfields.  The RAIM outages are listed as M-series  NOTAMs  and  may  be  obtained  for  up  to  24  hours  from  the  time  of request.    However,  this  list  currently  covers  only  320  military-use  airfields and may not include your intended destination. prediction at 5.10.2.4.  Fault  Detection  and  Exclusion  (FDE).    FDE  allows  GPS  equipment  to automatically  detect  and  exclude  faulty  satellites  from  the  navigation  solution.    FDE requires  a  minimum  of  6  satellites  in  view  (or  5  satellites  with  baro-aiding).    Past experience  indicates  that  without  FDE,  or  the  ability  to  manually  determine  which satellite is faulty and exclude it from the navigation solution, satellite failure can lead to significant GPS position errors (in excess of 100 nm).   FDE  is  required when utilizing GPS as a primary means of navigation in remote/oceanic areas. 5.10.3.  Using GPS in lieu of land-based NAVAIDS (RNAV substitution).  GPS equipment certified  for  IFR  operations  IAW  AFI  11-202V3,  may  be  used  in  place  of  land-based NAVAIDS for en route and terminal operations, in the following  situations (within the U.S. National  Airspace (NAS) and worldwide on procedures constructed by a  US-Gov‘t  TERPS authority (FAA/USN/USAF)): 5.10.3.1.  Determining the aircraft position over a TACAN, VOR, NDB, compass locator or DME fix. 5.10.3.2.  Determine  the  aircraft  position  over  a  named  fix  defined  by  a  VOR  course, NDB bearing, or compass locator bearing crossing a VOR or localizer course. 5.10.3.3.  Navigating  to    or  from  a  TACAN,  VOR,  NDB,  or  compass  locator.    For example, a pilot might proceed direct to a VOR or navigate on a segment of a departure procedure.  However, pilots may not substitute for the navigation aid providing lateral guidance for the final approach segment.  This restriction does not refer to instrument approach procedures with ―or GPS‖ in the title when using GPS or WAAS. 5.10.3.4.  Hold over a TACAN, VOR, NDB, compass locator or DME fix. 5.10.3.5.  Fly a DME arc.  These allowances do not include navigation on localizer-based courses (including localizer back-course guidance). 5.10.3.6.  NOTE:    Consult  individual  aircraft  flight  manuals  for  further  guidance concerning  use  of  RNAV  equipment  as  a  substitute  or  alternative  means  of  navigation.  Some aircraft may have  additional requirements to monitor the land-based NAVAID or restrictions  against  substituting  RNAV  guidance  for  inoperable  land-based  NAVAIDS.  Pilots must ensure their onboard navigation data is current, appropriate for the region of   76  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 intended  operation,  and  includes  the  navigation  aids,  waypoints,  and  relevant  coded terminal airspace procedures for the departure, arrival, and alternate airfields. 5.10.3.6.1.  The navigation database should be current for the duration of the flight. If the  Aeronautical  Information  Regulation  and  Control  (AIRAC)  cycle  will  change during flight, operators and pilots should establish procedures to ensure the accuracy of  navigation  data,  including  suitability  of  navigation  facilities  used  to  define  the routes  and  procedures  for  flight.  Traditionally,  this  has  been  accomplished  by verifying electronic data against paper products. One acceptable means is to compare aeronautical  charts  (new  and  old)  to  verify  navigation  fixes  prior  to  departure.  If  an amended chart is published for the procedure, the operator must not use the database to conduct the operation. 5.10.4.  Procedures for using GPS in lieu of land-based NAVAIDS.  In all cases, RAIM must be  available  and  operational,  and  any  fixes  used  for  navigation  must  be  retrieved  from  a current,  approved  database.    Except  for  RNAV  systems  using  WAAS  as  an  input,  when RNAV equipment using GPS input is planned as a substitute means of navigation guidance for part of an instrument  approach procedure at  a destination airport,  any  required alternate airport must have an available instrument approach procedure that does not require the use of GPS.  This  restriction  includes  conducting  a  conventional  approach  at  the  alternate  airport using a substitute means of navigation guidance based upon the use of GPS. 5.10.4.1.  Determining position over a DME fix: 5.10.4.1.1.  If the fix is  identified by  a five-letter name that  is contained in the GPS airborne database, select either the named fix or the facility establishing the DME fix as the active GPS waypoint (WP). 5.10.4.1.2.  If the fix is identified by a five-letter name, which is not contained in the GPS airborne database, or if the fix is not named, select the facility establishing the DME  fix  or  another  named  DME  fix  as  the  active  GPS  WP.    If  selecting  the  DME providing facility as the active GPS WP, consider yourself over the fix when the GPS distance  from  the  active  WP  equals  the  charted  DME  value  and  you  are  on  the appropriate bearing and course. 5.10.4.1.3.  NOTE:    Until  all  DME  sources  are  in  the  database,  pilots  may  use  a named DME fix as the active waypoint in lieu of using the DME source.  If using this method  the  named  DME  fix  must  be  on  the  same  course  and  based  on  the  same underlying  DME  source.    Pilots  should  be  extremely  careful  to  ensure  correct distance  measurements  are  used  when  utilizing  this  method.    Pilots  should  review distances for DME fixing during preflight preparation. 5.10.4.2.  Flying a DME arc: 5.10.4.2.1.  Select the DME facility from the airborne database as the active WP.  If this facility is not in your database, do not perform this operation. 5.10.4.2.1.1.  Use GPS distance to the WP in lieu of DME. 5.10.4.3.  Determining position over an NDB/compass locator 5.10.4.3.1.  Select the charted NDB/compass locator from database as active WP.  If facility is not in the airborne database, do not use a facility WP for this operation. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   77  5.10.4.3.2.  Select CDI terminal sensitivity (+- 1 nm) if in the terminal area. 5.10.4.3.3.  You  are  over  the  NDB/compass  locator  when  the  GPS  system  indicates you are over the active WP. 5.10.4.4.  Determining  position  over  a  fix  made  up  of  an  NDB/compass  locator  bearing crossing a VOR/LOC course. 5.10.4.4.1.  A  fix  made  up  by  a  crossing  NDB/compass  locator  bearing  will  be identified by a five-letter fix name.  Select either the named fix, or the NDB/compass locator  facility  providing  the  crossing  bearing  to  establish  the  fix  as  the  active  GPS WP.  If the facility is not in your airborne database, do not use a facility WP for this operation. 5.10.4.4.2.  If using the named fix, fix passage is when indicated by the GPS system as you fly the prescribed track from the non-GPS navigation source. 5.10.4.4.3.  If  using  the  NDB/Compass  locator  as  the  active  GPS  WP,  fix  passage occurs  when  the  GPS  bearing  to  the  active  WP  is  the  same  as  the  charted NDB/Compass  locator  bearing  for  the  fix  as  you  fly  the  prescribed  track  from  the non-GPS navigation source. 5.10.4.5.  Holding over an NDB/Compass locator. 5.10.4.5.1.  Select CDI terminal sensitivity (+- 1 nm) if in the terminal area. 5.10.4.5.2.  Select the NDB/compass locator as the active WP.  Fix must be retrieved from a current approved database. 5.10.4.5.3.  Program holding pattern IAW the flight manual. 5.10.4.5.4.  Hold using approved procedures. 5.10.5.  GPS  In  Lieu  Of  A  Named  Intersection.    GPS  equipment  certified  for  IFR  terminal area  operations  IAW  AFI  11-202V3  may  be  used  to  identify  a  named  intersection  for  en route and terminal operations, except for use as the principal instrument approach navigation source (U.S. National Airspace only): 5.10.5.1.  Determining position over a named intersection. 5.10.5.1.1.  Select  the  charted  named  intersection  from  database  as  active  WP.  Named  waypoints  must  be  retrieved  from  the  database;  waypoint  data  may  not  be entered manually or modified in any way. 5.10.5.1.2.  You are over the named fix when the GPS system indicates you are over the active WP. 5.10.6.  GPS Terminal Area Restrictions 5.10.6.1.  Definition of Terminal Area Procedures.  The FAA does not define the dividing line  between  terminal  area  procedures  and  other  types  of  RNAV  procedures  (DP, STARS,  etc.).    In  some  areas,  for  example  where  terrain  is  a  factor,  transitioning  to terminal area accuracy would be appropriate from the beginning of the STAR.  In other areas, for example in eastern Kansas where the terrain is relatively flat, terminal accuracy would  not  be  required  until  on  the  approach.    To  preclude  confusion,  the  USAF  has   78  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 adopted  the  following  as  procedure.    Terminal  Area  Procedures  and  Restrictions  as described  below  apply  when  on  any  segment  of  a  published  instrument  approach procedure as defined in AFI 11-202V3.  As a conservative technique, you may consider yourself  ―in  the  terminal  area‖  if  you  are  within  25  NM  of  the  facility,  below  Class  A airspace, or are using a published procedure for navigation (IAP/STAR/SID, etc). 5.10.6.1.1.  Equipment must meet  the requirements  of AFI  11-202V3 and have an operational RAIM capability. 5.10.6.1.2.  All  waypoints,  fixes,  and  facility  locations  must  be  retrieved  from  a current  aircraft  database.  Users  may  not  alter  terminal  procedures  retrieved  from the equipment database. 5.10.6.1.3.  Pilots  must  verify  all  waypoint  names,  sequence,  course,  distance,  and altitude information from the database against information listed on the paper copy of  the  terminal  procedure  (to  include  the  missed  approach)  as  discussed  in  the section  5.12  of  this  AFMAN,  and  as  directed  by  the  MAJCOM.  Aircrew  operating aircraft  equipped with an Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) are also  required to  verify FMS against EFB data. 5.10.6.1.4.  CDI  must  be  set  (either  manually  or  automatically)  to  terminal sensitivity (+- 1 nm). 5.10.6.1.5.  The  pilot  will  ensure  that  a  predictive  RAIM  check  is  accomplished prior  to  commencing  the  approach.  If  RAIM  outages  are  predicted  or  occur,  the flight must rely on other approved equipment; otherwise the flight must be rerouted, delayed, or canceled. 5.10.6.1.6.  Comply with alternate requirements IAW AFI 11-202V3. 5.10.7.  RNP  Special  Aircraft  and  Aircrew  Authorization  Required  (SAAAR)  Instrument Approach.  The RNP  SAAAR  IAP  is  one of the  newest  GPS procedures being developed.  These  procedures  are  only  authorized  for  MAJCOM  trained  and  certified  crews  and  are analogous  to  the  special  authorization  required  for  Category  II  or  III  ILS  procedures. SAAAR procedures are to be conducted only by aircrews meeting special MAJCOM training requirements  in  designated  aircraft  that  are  appropriately  equipped  to  meet  the  specified performance and functional requirements. 5.10.7.1.  Unique characteristics of RNP SAAAR Approaches 5.10.7.1.1.  RNP value. Each published line of minima has an associated RNP value. The  indicated  value  defines  the  lateral  and  vertical  performance  requirements.    A minimum RNP type is documented as part of the RNP SAAAR authorization for each aircraft  and  may  vary  depending  on  configuration  or  operational  procedures  (e.g., GPS inoperative, use of flight director vice autopilot). 5.10.7.1.2.  Curved path procedures. Some RNP approaches have a curved path, also called a radius-to-a-fix (RF) leg. Since not all aircraft have the capability to fly these arcs, pilots are responsible for knowing if they can conduct an RNP approach with an  arc  or  not.  Aircraft  speeds,  winds  and  bank  angles  have  been  taken  into consideration in the development of the procedures. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   79  5.10.7.1.3.  RNP required for extraction or not. Where required, the missed approach procedure  may  use  RNP  values  less  than  RNP-1.  The  reliability  of  the  navigation system has to be very high in order to conduct these approaches.  Operation on these procedures generally requires redundant equipment, as no single point of failure can cause loss of both approach and missed approach navigation. 5.10.7.1.4.  Non-standard  speeds  or  climb  gradients.    RNP  SAAAR  approaches  are developed based on standard approach speeds and a 200 ft/NM climb gradient in the missed approach. Any exceptions to these standards will be indicated on the approach procedure,  and  the  pilot  shall  ensure  the  aircraft  can  comply  with  any  published restrictions before conducting the operation. 5.10.7.1.5.  Temperature  Limits.    For  aircraft  using  barometric  vertical  navigation (without  temperature  compensation)  to  conduct  the  approach,  low  and  high-temperature  limits  are  identified  on  the  procedure.    Cold  temperatures  reduce  the glidepath angle while high temperatures increase the glidepath angle.  Aircraft using baro VNAV with  temperature  compensation or aircraft using an  alternate means for vertical  guidance  (e.g.,  SBAS)  may  disregard  the  temperature  restrictions.    The charted  temperature  limits  are  evaluated  for  the  final  approach  segment  only.  Regardless  of  charted  temperature  limits  or  temperature  compensation  by  the  FMS, the  pilot  may  need  to  manually  compensate  for  cold  temperature  on  minimum altitudes and the decision altitude. 5.10.7.1.6.  Aircraft size.  The achieved minimums may be dependent on aircraft size.  Large  aircraft  may  require  higher  minimums  due  to  gear  height  and/or  wingspan.  Approach procedure charts will be annotated with applicable aircraft size restrictions. 5.10.7.2.  Types of RNP SAAAR Approach Operations 5.10.7.1.1.  RNP  Stand-alone  Approach  Operations.    RNP  SAAAR  procedures  can provide  access  to  runways  regardless  of  the  ground-based  NAVAID  infrastructure, and  can  be  designed  to  avoid  obstacles,  terrain,  airspace,  or  resolve  environmental constraints. 5.10.7.1.2.  RNP Parallel Approach (RPA) Operations. RNP SAAAR procedures can be  used  for  parallel  approaches  where  the  runway  separation  is  adequate  (Figure 5.13).  Parallel  approach  procedures  can  be  used  either  simultaneously  or  as  stand-alone  operations.  They  may  be  part  of  either  independent  or  dependent  operations depending on the ATC ability to provide radar monitoring.   80  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 Figure 5.13.  RNP Parallel Approach (RPA).  5.10.7.1.3.  RNP  Parallel  Approach  Runway  Transitions  (RPAT)  Operations.  RPAT approaches  begin  as  a  parallel  IFR  approach  operation  using  simultaneous independent  or dependent  procedures. (Figure 5.14). Visual  separation standards are used  in  the  final  segment  of  the  approach  after  the  final  approach  fix,  to  permit  the RPAT aircraft to transition in visual conditions along a predefined lateral and vertical path to align with the runway centerline. Figure 5.14.  RNP Parallel Approach Runway Transitions (RPAT).  5.10.7.2.4.  RNP  Converging  Runway  Operations.  At  airports  where  runways converge,  but  may  or  may  not  intersect,  an  RNP  SAAAR  approach  can  provide  a precise  curved  missed  approach  path  that  conforms  to  aircraft  separation  minimums for  simultaneous  operations  (Fig  5.15).  By  flying  this  curved  missed  approach  path AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   81  with high accuracy and containment provided by RNP, dual runway operations may continue  to  be  used  to  lower  ceiling  and  visibility  values  than  currently  available. This type of operation allows greater capacity at airports where it can be applied. Figure 5.15.  RNP Converging Runway Operations.  5.11.  Database Issues for RNAV and GPS Navigation.  GPS and other RNAV procedures rely on  data  extracted  from  the  aircraft  navigation  database.    The  potential  for  serious  navigation errors  is  created  by  inherent  properties  of  database  creation  and  its  use  by  aircrew  and  aircraft systems.  In order to mitigate these potential errors crews must be familiar with database issues and required procedures. 5.11.1.  Aircraft use navigation databases provided by either National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency  (NGA)  (i.e.  DAFIF)  or  a  commercial  vendor  (i.e.  Jeppesen).    These  databases contain a worldwide list of airports, navigation aids, waypoints, and instrument procedures. Outside  the  US  NAS,  this  data  is  provided  by  host  nations,  and  is  not  necessarily  quality-checked by database providers during database creation.  Navigation data may be filtered and tailored to meet individual aircraft requirements.  Jeppesen tailors their data to meet customer specifications,  while  DAFIF  data  is  filtered  and  formatted  by  outside  contractors.  Updated navigation data is published on a 28-day cycle. 5.11.1.1.  Database  Requirements.    In  order  to  use  GPS  for  the  terminal  area,  all procedures  (DP,  Standard  Terminal  Arrival  (STAR),  IAP)  must  be  retrieved  in  their entirety from a current, approved navigation database.  Only those approaches included in the receiver database are authorized, and must display as full approaches (not advisory approaches which would not allow pilot to "arm" the approach). 5.11.1.1.1.  Manual  Data  Base  Manipulation.    Users  may  not  alter  terminal procedures retrieved from the equipment database. However, this requirement does not  prevent  the  storage  of  ―user-defined‖  data.    This  requirement  also  does  not preclude  aircrew  from  complying  with  ATC  instructions  by  proceeding  direct  to  a point  on  a STAR/DP  or by  receiving  ATC  vectors  onto  course.  This  ―user-defined‖ data, however, cannot be part of a terminal procedure, to include IAF or feeder fixes.   82  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 5.11.2.  Database related errors have occurred at all stages of database development and use.  Host nations have provided inaccurate data; database providers have introduced errors during database  creation  and  aircraft  specific incorrect waypoint/procedure  data;  finally,  aircraft  flight  management  systems/navigation  computers have flown instrument procedures in a manner that does not match the charted procedure. tailoring;  aircrew  have  selected 5.11.3.  A  paper  or  EFB  copy  of  the  applicable  instrument  procedure  (IAP,  SID,  STAR) must always be available and crosschecked in the terminal environment. 5.11.3.1.  Data Base Procedures. 5.11.3.1.1.  Prior  to  flight,  crews  must  check  navigation  database  validity.    If  the database has expired, the crew: 5.11.3.1.1.1.  May  continue  a  mission  with  an  expired  database  if  the  database information required for the flight can be verified with current FLIP. 5.11.3.1.1.2.  Shall get the database updated at the first opportunity. 5.11.3.1.1.3.  May not use the database to fly procedures that require terminal or better accuracy (i.e. terminal or approach). 5.11.4.  Defining Airways. 5.11.4.1.  Conventional  (Overlay)  Airways.    Appropriately  certified  RNAV  equipment may  be  used  to  fly  conventional  airways  (e.g.  FAA  J/V  routes).    These  routes  may  be either retrieved from the aircraft database or constructed by manually entering waypoints. 5.11.4.1.1.  If  within  aircraft  capabilities,  conventional  airways  should  be  retrieved from the aircraft database using the airway identifier. 5.11.4.1.2.  If  airways  cannot  be  retrieved  from  the  database  using  the  airway identifier,  conventional  airways  may  be  constructed  by  manual  entry  of  associated waypoints/NAVAIDS.    These  waypoints/NAVAIDS  should  be  retrieved  from  the database by waypoint name if possible.  Entry of all airway waypoints is not required.  At  a  minimum,  all  compulsory  waypoints,  all  NAVAIDS,  and  any  waypoint associated  with  a  change  in  course  must  be  entered.    On  crewed  aircraft,  if  airways are entered manually, waypoint sequence must be verified by another crewmember. 5.11.4.2.  RNAV Airways.  RNAV airways should be retrieved in their entirety from the database  using  the  airway  identifier.    If  entered  manually,  aircrew  must  ensure  that  all waypoints are entered and flyby/flyover attributes are correctly entered. 5.11.5.  RNAV Terminal Area Operations. As the production of stand-alone GPS approaches has progressed, many of the original overlay approaches have been replaced with stand-alone procedures  specifically  designed  for  use  by  GPS  systems.  The  title  of  the  remaining  GPS overlay procedures has been revised on the approach chart to ―or GPS‖ (e.g., VOR or GPS RWY 24). Therefore, all the approaches that can be used by GPS now contain ―GPS‖ in the title (e.g., ―VOR or GPS RWY 24,‖ ―GPS RWY 24,‖ or ―RNAV (GPS) RWY 24‖). During these  GPS  approaches,  underlying  ground-based  NAVAIDs  are  not  required  to  be operational  and  associated  aircraft  avionics  need  not  be  installed,  operational,  turned  on  or monitored (monitoring of the underlying approach is suggested when equipment is available AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   83  and functional). Existing overlay approaches may be requested using the  GPS title, such as ―GPS RWY 24‖ for the VOR or GPS RWY 24. 5.11.5.1.  Some databases may not contain all transitions or departures from all runways.  Terminal  area  and  instrument  approach  procedures  must  be  retrieved  in  their  entirety from  the  navigation  database.    These  procedures  may  not  be  modified  or  entered manually. 5.11.5.2.  Prior  to  commencing  a  terminal  area  or  instrument  approach  procedure, crews  must  confirm  waypoint  name,  sequence,  course,  distance,  and  altitude information  match  charted the  missed  approach segment).  Waypoint  type  (flyby  vs.  flyover)  should  also  be  confirmed  if  this information  is  available.  MAJCOMS  should  establish  procedures  for  their  crews  to perform these required actions. information (to include 5.11.5.3.  In the event of differences between the terminal procedure chart or approach chart  and  database,  the  published  approach  chart,  supplemented  by  NOTAMs,  holds precedence  and  the  database  may  not  be  used  to  fly  terminal  area  or  instrument approach procedures except as noted below. 5.11.5.3.1.  In some cases, waypoints in the navigation database may differ from the charted instrument procedure.  The differences listed below are acceptable and do not preclude use of the database procedure. 5.11.5.3.1.1.  Step  down  fixes  depicted  on  the  approach  chart  may  not  be contained in the aircraft database. Pilots are responsible for ensuring compliance with  applicable  step  down  fixes  regardless  of  whether  or  not  they  are  in  the aircraft database. 5.11.5.3.1.2.  The  database  may  contain  some  waypoints  (capture  fixes,  and  a point in lieu of a FAF for non-FAF overlay approaches) that are not depicted on the approach chart. 5.11.5.3.2.  Small differences may exist in distances between waypoints.    For GPS and  RNAV  approaches,  the  maximum  allowable  difference  is  0.1nm.    If  distance information varies by more than these tolerances, the procedure shall not be flown. If  the  FMS  does  not  display  distances  to  the  tenth  of  a  mile  during  the  approach review, then an acceptable technique would be for the pilot to confirm the distance to the  next  approach  waypoint  to  a  tenth  of  a  mile  on  the  EHSI  at  each  changeover point. 5.11.5.3.3.  Computation  of  the  GPS  final  approach  course  is  based  on  the  station magnetic  variation  retrieved  from  the  aircraft  magnetic  variation  database.    Many aircraft lack the capability to update the magnetic variation database.  This will cause a  difference  between  the  displayed  GPS  final  approach  course  and  the  charted  final approach  course  in  the  IAP.    The  discrepancy  between  displayed  and  charted magnetic  variation  will  depend  on  discrepancy  between  aircraft  magnetic  variation database  (age  of  database)  vs.  magnetic  variation  upon  which  charted  approach course is based (date of magnetic variation survey).  Variation between charted final approach  course  in  the  IAP  and  the  final  approach  course  computed  by  the  aircraft   84  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 should  be  no  more  than  5  degrees.    If  the  two  differ  by  more  than  5  degrees,  the procedure is not authorized. 5.11.5.4.  Crews must be knowledgeable of system limitations and be ready to manually intervene  with  RNAV  or  GPS  equipment  if  necessary.    Certain  segments  of  a  missed approach,  DP,  or  SID  may  require  some  manual  intervention  by  the  pilot,  especially when radar vectored or required to intercept a specific course to a waypoint. 5.11.5.5.  Due  to  aircraft  specific  limitations,  on  some  occasions  aircraft  may  not  fly  a database  procedure  as  indicated  on  the  chart,  even  though  the  procedure  is  correctly coded in the database.  This is especially true of missed approach and DP operations that have closely spaced waypoints or require turns initiated at an associated altitude.  Crews must carefully monitor aircraft performance to ensure adherence to the charted procedure. 5.11.6.  WGS-84  is  the  worldwide  charting  standard  for  coding  database  information.  The use  of  this  common  reference  system  is  required  to  ensure  accurate  navigation.    Although most  nations  have  signed  up  to  the  WGS-84  standard,  there  is  no  means  of  ensuring compliance, and not all data from foreign nations is developed IAW WGS-84. A number of database  discrepancies  have  been  reported  in  foreign  airspace.  Aircrews  must  monitor underlying  ground  based  navigation  aids  when  available.    In  the  event  of  discrepancy between  RNAV/GPS  information  and  the  underlying  navigation  aids,  crews  must  revert  to using underlying ground-based navigation data. 5.11.7.  Both Jeppesen and NGA (DAFIF) have established procedures for informing crews of  known  database  problems.    Crews  must  check  database  NOTAMs  prior  to  flight  for information on any planned RNAV or GPS procedures. 5.11.7.1.  NGA (DAFIF) database NOTAMs associated with a particular airfield are class ―W‖ NOTAMs and may be obtained by entering an airfield identifier in the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) NOTAM web site (https://www.notams.jcs.mil/dinsQueryWeb).  DAFIF NOTAMs  not  associated  with  a  particular  airfield  (airway  NOTAMs,  etc.)  may  be obtained  by  consulting  FLIP  change  notices  via  the  DAFIF  NOTAMs  link  on  the  JCS NOTAM web site..  The Jeppesen NOTAM page contains information on airfield specific procedures at the top of the page and has links  to regional information at the bottom of the page.  Jeppesen database NOTAMs may be accessed through the links section of the JCS NOTAM web site. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   85  Chapter 6 PLANNING AN INSTRUMENT FLIGHT 6.1.  Preflight  Planning.  A  successful  instrument  flight  starts  with  a  thorough  preflight planning session.  This planning should include a number of items including NOTAMS, weather for the entire route of flight including the departure and arrival aerodromes, takeoff and landing data (TOLD), all publications necessary to conduct the flight (e.g. Departure procedures, enroute charts,  FIH,  Arrival  Procedures,  Instrument  Approach  Procedures,  applicable  FLIP  materials, ASRR,  etc.),  the  route  of  flight,  and  the  production  of  a  flight  plan  and  flight  plan  log  that determines the amount of time and fuel needed for the flight including possible diversion to an alternate, if applicable. See also AFI 11-202V3. 6.2.  NOTAMS.  NOTAM  is  defined  in  AFJMAN  11-208,  DoD  Notice  to  Airmen  (NOTAM) System,  as  an  unclassified  notice  containing  information  concerning  the  establishment  of, condition  of,  or  change  in  an  aeronautical  facility,  service,  procedures  or  hazards;  the  timely knowledge of which is essential for safe flight operations.  Checking NOTAMs is a critical step in the flight planning process. NOTAM information is available from the U.S. NOTAM System (USNS) via the DoD Internet NOTAM Distribution System (DINS). To fully understand where and how to get all available NOTAM information, it is important to understand the USNS. 6.2.1.  Defense  Internet  NOTAM  System.    DINS  is  composed  of  a  large  central  data management system deriving information from the US Consolidated NOTAM Office at the FAA  Air  Traffic  Control  System  Command  Center  (ATCSCC)  located  at  Herndon,  VA.  Real-time  NOTAM  information  is  maintained  and  made  available  through  the  internet. https://www.notams.jcs.mil    Coverage  includes  all  military  airfields  and  virtually  all domestic, international, and Flight Data Center   (FDC)  NOTAMs.   If not covered by DINS, the airfield does not transmit NOTAM data to the USNS.  A plain language notice in red font is  displayed  advising  the  user  of  that  fact.    In  such  a  case,  you  must  contact  the  airfield manager or associated Flight Service Station directly for NOTAM information. 6.2.1.1.  NOTAM  abbreviations  are  explained  in  the  FIH  and  the  Notices  to  Airmen Publication  (NTAP).    NOTAM  abbreviations  for  DINS  can  be  found  in  the  FIH  and FAAO 7930.2M Notice to Airmen (NOTAMS). 6.2.2.  A  comprehensive  discussion  of  the  U.S.  and  international  NOTAM  systems  can  be found  in  AFMAN  11-217V3,  and  AFI  11-208,  Department  of  Defense  Notice  to  Airman (NOTAM) System. 6.3.  Weather.  Aircrew  can  obtain  departure,  enroute  and  arrival  weather  information  from  a number  of  sources.    For  authorized  weather  sources,  see  FLIP  IFG.    At  military  airfields,  the normal source is the DD 175-1 filled out and briefed by a military weather briefer from one of the  regional  Operational  Weather  Squadrons.    At  civil  fields,  aircrew  may  obtain  weather  by contacting the Operational Weather Squadron serving the area, or  a  FSS  and  getting a weather brief over the phone by calling 1 800 WX-BRIEF. 6.3.1.  Cold Weather Altimeter Corrections. Pressure altimeters are calibrated to indicate true altitude  under  International  Standard  Atmospheric  (ISA)  conditions.  Any  deviation  from these  standard  conditions  will  result  in  an  erroneous  reading  on  the  altimeter.  This  error becomes important when considering obstacle clearances in temperatures lower than standard   86  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 since  the  aircraft‘s  altitude  is  below  the  figure  indicated  by  the  altimeter.  The  error  is proportional  to  the  difference  between  actual  and  ISA  temperature  and  the  height  of  the aircraft  above  the  altimeter  setting  source.  The  amount  of  error  is  approximately  4  feet  per thousand feet for each degree Celsius of difference. Corrections will only be made for DAs, MDAs, and other altitudes inside, but not including, the FAF. The same correction made to DAs  and  MDAs  can  be  applied  to  other  altitudes  inside  the  FAF.  For  the  current  cold weather  altimeter  correction  procedure,  you  must  refer  to  the  Flight  Information Handbook (FIH). The following guidance is provided as an example of how to accomplish the procedure found in the FIH. 6.3.1.1.  To ensure adequate obstacle  clearance the values derived  from  the chart below will be: 6.3.1.1.1.  Added to  the  published DA or MDA  and step-down fixes inside the FAF whenever the outside air temperature is less than 0° Celsius 6.3.1.1.2.  Added  to  ALL  altitudes  in  the  procedure  in  Designated  Mountainous Regions whenever the outside air temperature is 0° Celsius or less 6.3.1.1.3.  Added  to  ALL  altitudes  in  the  procedure  whenever  the  outside  air temperature is -30° Celsius or less, or procedure turn, intermediate approach altitude Heights  Above Touchdown (HAT)/Heights  Above Aerodrome (HAA)  are 3000 feet or more above the altimeter setting source. Table 6.1.  Temperature Correction Chart. 6.3.1.1.4.  Example:    For  an  approach  when  OAT  is  -20°  C,  and  the  HAA  is  760‘ AGL on the IAP, the pilot should add 110‘ to the MDA for the approach.  Thus, if the MDA  was  940‘  MSL,  the  pilot  would  only  descend  to  1050‘  (940+110=1050). NOTE:  Do  not  change  the  value  in  the  RADAR  ALTIMETER--you  are  still descending to the HAA on the IAP, you are only correcting for temperature error in the barometric altimeter (Table 6.1). 6.4.  Route.  Preflight  planning  of  the  enroute  portion  should  be  adequate  to  enseure  safe  and efficient flight.  As a minimum, aircrew should review:  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   87  6.4.1.  The  intended  route  of  flight  (to  include  preferred  routing  located  in  AP/1)  using current flight publications. 6.4.2.  En route NOTAMs. 6.4.3.  En route weather. 6.4.4.  FLIP products.  The appropriate FLIP products to ensure compliance with any special procedures that may apply. 6.4.5.  Diversion fields.  Emergency diversion fields and approaches. 6.4.6.  Compliance.  Comply with the jet route or airway system as published on the FLIP en route  charts  and  air  traffic  clearances.    You  must  also  ensure  your  aircraft  is  equipped  and authorized  to  operate  in  the  airspace  along  your  route  of  flight.    For  example,  only  aircraft certified  through  their  MAJCOM  for  RNP-5  may  operate  in  the  European  Basic  RNAV (BRNAV)  structure.    Consult  your  MAJCOM  and  Mission  Design  Series  (MDS)-specific guidance if you have any doubts concerning your aircraft‘s capabilities. 6.4.7.  Enroute Navigation in  High  Latitudes.  Enroute navigation in  higher latitude regions may  be  based  on  reference  to  true  or  grid  north  instead  of  the  customary  reference  to magnetic  north.    Procedures  vary  greatly  between  aircraft  type  and  avionics  capabilities.  Thorough  mission  planning,  including  review  of  applicable  aircraft/avionics  specific procedures and limitations, is essential to accurate navigation at higher latitudes. 6.4.7.1.  When flying at higher latitudes, review the enroute charts carefully to ensure you are cognizant of the heading source required by the instrument procedures in the airspace you  are  transiting,  and  the  orientation  reference  of  the  NAVAID.    This  is  annotated  on the enroute chart as shown in Figure 6.1. Figure 6.1.  Enroute Charts for Navigation in Higher Latitudes.    88  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 6.4.7.2.  Normally, navigation north of 70°North latitude or south of 60°South latitude is conducted  with  reference  to  true  north  or  grid  north.    Specific  procedures  vary  greatly depending  on  aircraft  type,  avionics  capabilities,  and  crew  complement.    Unless otherwise  annotated,  where  there  is  a  reference  to  true  north,  the  text  also  applies  in southern latitudes and applies to navigation with reference to grid north/south. 6.4.7.2.1.  There  are  areas  officially  designated  Areas  of  Magnetic  Unreliability (AMU).  Aircraft capable of displaying only magnetic heading are prohibited from operating in designated AMUs.  For areas north of 70°North and south of 60° South that  are  not  officially  designated  as  AMUs,  MAJCOMs  will  determine  the  highest allowable  latitude  for  aircraftcapable  of  displaying  only  magnetic  heading  (Figure 6.2). 6.4.7.2.1.1.  NOTE:    Although  partly  south  of  70°  North,  the  entire  Canadian Northern and Arctic Control Areas and areas of Northern Domestic Airspace are designated as AMUs. 6.4.7.2.2.  MAJCOMs  must  provide  aircraft-specific  operational  approval  prior  to enroute  and  terminal  area  operations  using  navigation  aids  oriented  to  true  or grid.  Operational  approval  shall  be  based  on  development  of  aircraft  specific procedures  and  training.    As  a  minimum,  procedures  and  training  should  address:  identification of areas where reference to true or grid north is required, procedures for displaying true or grid heading reference, procedures for verifying magnetic variation information  from  the  aircraft  navigation  computer,  procedures  for  inputting  manual magnetic  variation  information,  procedures  for  returning  to  automatic  magnetic variation computation, minimum equipment requirements, and emergency procedures in the event of true or grid navigation equipment failure while operating in the AMU. 6.4.7.3.  Aircraft  navigation  displays  must  be  set  to  display  true  north  prior  to  flying true  headings  or  courses.  Suitably  equipped  aircraft  may  also  use  grid  reference  if applicable. 6.4.7.4.  Outside  of  designated  AMUs,  aircraft  unable  to  display  true  or  grid  heading may  use  navigation  aids  oriented  to  true  north  for  enroute  navigation  provided procedures listed below are followed. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   89  Figure 6.2.  Canadian Northern Control Area Boundaries (Areas South of 70°N Where True Tracks  6.4.7.4.1.  Enroute  navigation  using  approved  RNAV  equipment  backed  up  by display of VOR/TAC/NDB data is recommended.  Depending on system architecture, aircraft  navigation  computers  (flight  management  systems)  automatically  provide magnetic variation information.  Accuracy of this magnetic variation  depends on the period  of  time  since  the  last  magnetic  variation  update.    Some  systems  contain magnetic  variation  information  that  cannot  be  updated.    Also,  some  navigation systems  provide  magnetic  variation  information  for  only  a  limited  portion  of  the globe.    Thus,  when  true  or  grid  heading  information  cannot  be  displayed,  aircraft magnetic variation information must be verified with current aeronautical charts prior to use of RNAV equipment to fly true or grid courses.  For navigation using FMS or other  RNAV  system,  procedures  and  system  limitations  vary  widely  among  aircraft and  avionics  installations.    Consult  your  aircraft  flight  manual  and  MAJCOM directives for specific FMS and RNAV procedures for navigation where reference to true or grid north is required. 6.4.7.5.  For navigation using VOR or TACAN, if the NAVAID is oriented to true north, use the following procedures for enroute navigation: 6.4.7.5.1.  NOTE:    Only  VORs  and  TACANs  can  be  oriented  to  true  north.    NDBs cannot be oriented to true north.  ADF needles always display relative bearing to the station.   90  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 6.4.7.5.2.  If  your  aircraft  allows  selection  of  true  north  as  a  heading  reference, select true north.  No additional corrections are required for courses or headings. 6.4.7.5.3.  If  your  aircraft  does  not  allow  selection  of  true  north  as  a  heading reference, use the following procedures: 6.4.7.5.3.1.  VOR  and  TACAN  courses  do  not  require  correction  for  magnetic variation. 6.4.7.5.3.1.1.  The  desired  true  course  must  be  set  into  the  CDI.  The  aircraft CDI will indicate deviations left and right of the desired true course. However, with  magnetic  heading  displayed,  the  bearing  pointer  will  not  point  to  the station,  but  will  instead  indicate  true  bearing  to  the  station.  In  other  words, when  established  on  course,  the  CDI  will  be  centered  on  the  desired  true course, but the bearing pointer will indicate true bearing to the station and will be displaced from aircraft no-wind heading by the amount of station magnetic variation.    For  example,  the  Thule  magnetic  variation  is  approximately  60 degrees west.  When proceeding inbound on the Thule 180 degree radial true (360  course),  the  aircraft  no  wind  heading  will  be  060,  while  the  bearing pointer  will  point  to  360.  Be  aware  that  this  discrepancy  between  aircraft heading and desired course may make flight director guidance unreliable. 6.4.7.5.3.2.  All headings require corrections for magnetic variation. 6.4.7.6.  For navigation using NDB, use the following procedures: 6.4.7.6.1.  NOTE:    Only  VORs  and  TACANs  can  be  oriented  to  true  north.    NDBs cannot be oriented to true north.  ADF needles always display relative bearing to the station. 6.4.7.6.2.  If  your  aircraft  allows  selection  of  true  north  as  a  heading  reference, select true north.  No additional corrections are required for relative bearings. 6.4.7.6.3.  If  your  aircraft  does  not  allow  selection  of  true  north  as  a  heading reference, all relative bearings require correction for magnetic variation. 6.4.7.6.3.1.  Crews  should  compute  and  fly  the  appropriate  magnetic  course  by correcting the desired true course for the magnetic variation at the current aircraft location.  Use  the  magnetic  variation  at  your  current  location.    This  correction should  be  updated  at  least  every  5°  of  magnetic  variation  or  every  30  nm, whichever occurs first. 6.4.8.  Minimum Altitudes. 6.4.8.1.  Altitude Clearances.  Ensure altitude clearances received en route do not conflict with  minimum  en  route  altitudes  (MEA),  minimum  obstruction  clearance  altitudes (MOCA),  minimum  reception  altitudes  (MRA),  or  minimum  crossing  altitudes  (MCA) shown on en route charts. 6.4.8.2.  Controlled Airspace.  In controlled airspace, the air traffic controller will assign altitudes that provide obstacle clearance.  You should use all available navigation aids to remain position-oriented and immediately query the controller if there is any uncertainty of  the  obstacle  clearance  provided  by  the  assigned  altitude.    When  flying  via  published AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   91  routing (a route with minimum altitudes depicted), compliance with the minimum altitude published on the routing ensures obstacle clearance.  If a published minimum altitude is not available, aircrews must determine minimum altitudes in accordance with AFI 11-202V3. 6.4.8.3.  Uncontrolled  Airspace.    In  uncontrolled  airspace,  you  must  ensure  the altitudes flown will provide obstacle clearance during all phases of flight. 6.4.8.4.  Radio Failure.  In case of radio failure, you are responsible for minimum altitude selection.  Comply with published radio failure procedures in the FIH. 6.5.  Planning the Approach.  Preparation for flying an instrument approach begins with a study of the approach depiction during preflight planning. The end result of an approach--a landing or a  missed  approach--can  be  directly  dependent  upon  the  pilot's  familiarity  with  the  approach depiction. 6.5.1.  Aircraft Categories and Instrument Approach Procedures Selection. 6.5.1.1.  Category.  Aircraft approach category is based on 1.3 times the stalling speed in the  landing  configuration  at  maximum  certificated  gross  landing  weight.      An  aircraft can fly an IAP only for its own category or higher, unless otherwise authorized by AF Instruction or MAJCOM directives.  If it is necessary to maneuver at speeds in excess of the  upper  limit  of  a  speed  range  for  a  category,  the  minimums  for  the  next  higher category should be used.  The categories are as follows: 6.5.1.1.1.  Category A - Speed less than 91 knots. 6.5.1.1.2.  Category B - Speed 91 knots or more but less than 121 knots. 6.5.1.1.3.  Category C - Speed 121 knots or more but less than 141 knots. 6.5.1.1.4.  Category D - Speed 141 knots or more but less than 166 knots. 6.5.1.1.5.  Category E - Speed 166 knots or more. 6.5.1.1.5.1.  NOTE:    If  MAJCOMs  allow  aircraft  to  fly  an  IAP  using  a  lower category,  the  MAJCOM  must  publish  procedures  to  ensure  that  aircraft  do  not exceed  TERPS  airspace  for  the  IAP  being  flown  to  include  circling  and  missed approach. 6.5.1.2.  IAP chart.  A  current  copy  of  the  appropriate  IAP  chart  must  be  available  in the aircraft for the departure base, destination, and all planned alternates. 6.5.1.2.1.  Approved  sources  for  IAP  charts  used  in  aircraft  include  printed  FLIP distributed by NGA, National Aeronautical Charting Office (NACO), or other source authorized by your MAJCOM (for example, Jeppesen). 6.5.1.2.1.1.  Do  not  print  an  IAP  from  DAFIF  and  then  fly  that  digital version.  Until  the  DAFIF  is  certified  for  terminal  IFR  use  in  your  weapon system, always use the IAP distributed electronically or via printed FLIP. 6.5.1.2.1.2.  IAPs downloaded from the NGA website in PDF format are identical to  those in  the printed NGA approach books.   Effective dates  are printed  on the bottom  of  each  downloaded  page.  The  responsibility  for  ensuring  the  current version of an IAP is onboard lies with the pilot.   92  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 6.5.1.2.1.2.1.  Note  that  comparing  amendment  numbers  or  Julian  dates  on new plates against previously printed plates is not a valid way of determining currency.  Information on a plate can change without an amendment number or Julian date change! 6.5.1.2.1.3.  If you print an IAP from the JEPPVIEW CD distributed by Jeppesen (or another equivalent commercial product), ensure the CD is current and you are a  licensed  user  of  that  CD.    If  you  do  not  know  the  license  arrangement  with Jeppesen  (or  other  commercial  vendor),  do  not  use  the  IAP.    The  vendors  and USAF  take  copyright  violations  very  seriously.    It  is  the  responsibility  of  each pilot  to  ensure not  only  currency of  IAPs  prior to use, but  also  compliance with copyright  and  licensing  agreements.    These  agreements  may  vary  from  Wing  to Wing. 6.5.1.2.1.4.  Do  not  fly  non-US  Government  IAPs  unless  properly  trained  and the  procedure(s)  are  approved  by  your  MAJCOM  TERPS.  (TERPS  will  not provide a review on non-US government instrument procedures if a DoD (NGA) or FAA (NACO) product for the same procedure exists.) 6.5.1.2.2.  Low  altitude  IAP  charts  normally  depict  instrument  approaches  for categories  A,  B,  C,  and  D  aircraft.    High  altitude  IAP  charts  depict  instrument approaches  for  category  C,  D,  and  E  aircraft.    When  an  operational  requirement exists, the low altitude IAP charts may depict category E procedures. 6.5.1.2.2.1.  NOTE:  If there is a discrepancy between stand-alone GPS approach charts and the database onboard the aircraft, the chart takes precedence. 6.5.1.2.2.2.  NOTE:  Consult  the  Terminal  Change  Notice  (TCN)  to  ensure  the approach selected is current. 6.5.1.3.  Navigation  Equipment  Compatibility.    Ensure  the  approach  you  select  is compatible  with  the  navigation  equipment  installed  and  operating  on  your  aircraft, including the missed approach instructions. 6.5.1.3.1.  Exception:  If  there  is  a  requirement  to  execute  an  approach  procedure with  incompatible  missed  approach  instructions,  ATC  may  be  able  to  issue alternate  missed  approach  instructions.    Request  alternate  missed  approach instructions prior to accepting approach clearance. 6.5.1.3.1.1.  NOTE:  This requirement  for alternate missed approach instructions does  not  preclude  practice  approaches  if  the  field  is  VFR  according  to  AFI  11-202V3. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   93  Figure 6.3.  Equipment Requirements for IAP.  6.5.1.3.2.  Straight-in  approaches.    The  types  of  navigation  aids  that  provide  final approach  guidance  and  the  runway  to  which  the  final  approach  courses  are  aligned identify  straight-in  approaches.    A  slash  (/)  indicates  that  more  than  one  type  of equipment  may  be  required  to  execute  the  final  approach  (VOR/DME,  ILS/DME, etc.).    Be  aware  that  additional  equipment  may  be  required  to  execute  the  other portions of the procedure (Figure 6.4).   94  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 Figure 6.4.  IAP With “/” in Title.  6.5.1.3.2.1.  Where  more  than  one  approach  using  the  same  final  approach guidance  is  developed  to  the  same  runway,  each  runway/navigational  aid combination will be identified with an alphabetical suffix beginning at the end of the  alphabet;  e.g.  ILS  Z  RWY  28L  (first  procedure),  ILS  Y  RWY  28L  (second procedure),  ILS  X  RWY  28L  (third  procedure),  etc.      Suffixes  will  be  used  in reverse alphabetical order, beginning with ―Z‖ (Figure 6.5). AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   95  Figure 6.5.  More Than One Approach With Same Final Approach Guidance.  6.5.1.3.3.  VOR  approaches.    Some  VOR  approaches  are  approved  for  use  by TACAN  equipped  aircraft.    These  will  be  designated  by  the  term  "(TAC)"  printed adjacent to the name of the procedure, for example, VOR-A (TAC). 6.5.1.3.4.  Circling  approaches.    When  the  name  of  the  approach  is  followed  by  a letter  such  as  A,  B,  C,  etc.,  the  approach  is  designed  for  circling  minimums  only.  Circling  approaches  are  designated  VOR-A,  TACAN-B,  NDB-C,  etc.    Circling approach designators will begin at the beginning of the alphabet (Figure 6.6).   96  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 Figure 6.6.  Circling Approach.  6.5.1.4.  Radar  Minimums.    Radar  minimums  by  aircraft  category  may  be  found  in  a separate section in the IAP book. 6.5.2.  True Approach Procedures. 6.5.2.1.  Selected instrument approach procedures in higher latitude regions may be based on  reference  to  true  or  grid  north/south  instead  of  the  customary  reference  to  magnetic north/south.    Procedures  vary  greatly  between  aircraft  type  and  avionics  capabilities.  Thorough  mission  planning,  including  review  of  applicable  aircraft/avionics  specific procedures and limitations, is essential to safely flying an instrument approach at higher latitudes. 6.5.2.1.1.  When flying at higher latitudes, review the IAP carefully to ensure you are cognizant of the heading source required by instrument procedures and the orientation AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   97  reference of the NAVAID.  This is annotated on the IAP as shown in Figures 6.7, 6.8 and 6.9. 6.5.2.1.1.1.  NOTE:    At  airfields  with  true  or  grid  approaches,  the  runway direction number will also be based on reference to true or grid, as appropriate. 6.5.2.1.2.  USAF  aircrews  are  authorized  to  fly  true  or  grid  approaches  in accordance with their aircraft flight manuals and MAJCOM directives. 6.5.2.1.3.  Except as noted below, aircraft must possess a true or grid heading source, and be able to display true or grid heading on appropriate navigation displays in order to fly terminal area true or grid instrument procedures in night or IMC. 6.5.2.1.4.  Aircraft without a true or grid heading source may fly true or grid RNAV (GPS)  approaches  and  true  or  grid  RNAV  departure  procedures  in  night  or  IMC providing the RNAV procedure provides all required magnetic course information. 6.5.2.1.5.  For  terminal  area  procedures  referenced  to  true  north,  the  following guidance applies: 6.5.2.1.5.1.  Note:    This  section  covers  general  true  approach  procedures,  your flight manual and/or MAJCOM may have additional procedures or limitations. 6.5.2.1.5.2.  Radar  vectors  should  be  provided  with  reference  to  true  north.  If  in doubt, query the controller. 6.5.2.1.5.3.  Orientation of an IAP to true north will be indicated by inclusion of the word ―true‖ in the procedure title. 6.5.2.1.5.4.  Select true as a heading source IAW with your aircraft flight manual and MAJCOM directives. 6.5.2.1.5.4.1.  NOTE:    ADF  needles  always  display  relative  bearing  to  the station.  Localizer signals emanate along a fixed path along the final approach course.    CDIs  always  indicate  position  relative  to  the  final  approach  course regardless of what is dialed into the CSW. 6.5.2.1.5.5.  Select the published true final approach course as appropriate for the type of approach  and aircraft  equipment.   For aircraft  capable of displaying true heading, no further corrections to headings, courses or bearings are required. 6.5.2.1.6.  For aircraft not capable of displaying true north, instrument approaches in night or IMC are not authorized.  If your aircraft does not allow selection of true north  as  a  heading  reference,  use  the  following  procedures  when  flying  a  true approach (Day, VMC Only): 6.5.2.1.6.1.  WARNING:    In  certain  areas,  magnetic  heading  indications  may  be unreliable  or  erratic.    If  magnetic  heading  indications  are  suspect,  do  not commence  the  approach.    If  already  established  on  the  approach  and  magnetic heading indications are suspect, execute a missed approach. 6.5.2.1.6.2.  WARNING:    Flight  director  commands  and  CDI  deflection  may  be grossly inaccurate on aircraft without a true heading source even with proper set-up of courses, bearings, and headings.   98  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 6.5.2.1.6.3.  VOR  and  TACAN  approaches.    VOR  and  TACAN  final  approach courses  do  not  require  correction  for  magnetic  variation.    Dial  in  the  true  final approach  course  as  depicted  on  the  IAP.    Although  the  CDI  will  be  centered when  on  course,  the  bearing  pointer  will  point  to  the  true  bearing  to  the  station.  When selecting a heading to fly to intercept/maintain the course, corrections for magnetic  variation  are  required.    Use  the  magnetic  variation  at  the  NAVAID the approach is based upon. 6.5.2.1.6.4.  NDB  Approaches.    NDBs  cannot  be  oriented  to  true  north.    ADF needles always display relative bearing to the station.   Corrections for magnetic variation must be applied to the published bearing(s).  When selecting a heading to  fly  to  intercept/maintain  the  published  bearing,  corrections  for  magnetic variation  are  also  required.    Use  the  magnetic  variation  at  the  NAVAID  the approach is based upon. 6.5.2.1.6.5.  ILS  and  Localizer Approaches  (includes  LDA, SDF,  and  LOC BC).   Localizer signals emanate along a fixed path along the final approach course and cannot  be  oriented  on  true  north.    CDIs  always  indicate  position  relative  to  the final  approach  course  regardless  of  what  is  dialed  into  the  CSW.    However, selection  of  the  correct  final  approach  course  is  critical  to  insuring  consistent cockpit  indications  of  position  relative  to  the  final  approach  course.    When selecting a course to dial in, corrections for magnetic variation must be applied to the published front  course to  insure consistent cockpit indications while on final approach.      When  selecting  a  heading  to  fly  to  intercept/maintain  the  published final  approach  course,  corrections  for  magnetic  variation  are  also  required.    Use the magnetic variation at the airport. 6.5.2.1.6.6.  PAR,  ASR,  and  Radar  Vectors.    When  being  radar  vectored  in  the vicinity  of  an  airport  using  true  north  as  a  heading  reference,  all  vectors  will  be issued in true headings.  If your aircraft does not allow selection of true north as a heading reference, corrections for magnetic variation are required. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   99  Figure 6.7.  True VOR Approach.    100  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 Figure 6.8.  True NDB Approach.  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   101  Figure 6.9.  True ILS Approach.  6.5.3.  Grid Approach Procedures.  (Figures 6.10 and 6.11) In some cases a NAVAID may be oriented on grid north, or a grid final approach course may be published alongside a magnetic or true final approach course.  Use the following general procedures to fly a grid approach.  Consult  your  aircraft  flight  manual  and  MAJCOM  directives  for  specific  equipment, procedures, and crew complement to fly grid. 6.5.3.1.  The heading reference of the primary means of navigation on final approach, the heading reference of the NAVAID the approach is based on, and the orientation of the runway direction number should all be the same. 6.5.3.1.1.  NOTE:  The NAVAID the approach is based on and the runway direction number normally will use the same heading reference.   102  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 6.5.3.1.2.  When  a  final  approach  course  using  another  heading  reference  is published on the IAP in parenthesis, this is provided for situational awareness, and is  not  to  be  used  as  the  primary  means  of  navigation  on  final  approach.  Use  the grid course IAW with the aircraft flight manual and MAJCOM directives. 6.5.3.1.3.  If  the  NAVAID  and  runway  direction  number  are  oriented  on  grid  north, then grid is the primary means of navigation along final approach.  Use aircraft flight manual procedures and MAJCOM directives to fly a grid approach.  If a magnetic or true final approach course is published alongside the grid course it should only be used as a situational awareness tool, not the primary means of navigation. Figure 6.10.  Magnetic Heading Reference With Grid Course.  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   103  Figure 6.11.  Grid Approach. 6.5.4.  Reviewing an IAP (Figure 6.12).  Prior to departure, you should become familiar with all aspects of the IAP so that during the recovery you can concentrate on flying the maneuver rather  than  trying  to  fly  and  interpret  it  simultaneously.    Here  are  some  important  areas  to consider and techniques to use:    104  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 Figure 6.12.  Review of the IAP. 6.5.4.1.  Plan View.  6.5.4.1.1.  Ground  Track.    Note  the  general  ground  track  of  the  approach,  the NAVAIDs  that  provide  the  course  guidance,  and  the  NAVAID  location.    (The NAVAIDs that appear in the name of an IAP are the NAVAIDs that provide the final approach  guidance.    Other  types  of  NAVAIDs  may  be  required  to  accomplish  the approach and missed approach.) 6.5.4.1.2.  Initial Approach Fix.  Note the location of the IAF you plan to use as well as the NAVAID used to define the fix.  Sometimes the IAF is displayed on the IAP by name only, and the NAVAID and radial/DME that defines the point is not listed.  In  this  case,  refer  to  the  appropriate  en  route  and  terminal  charts  for  the  area  to determine the NAVAID and the radial/DME that defines the IAF. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   105  6.5.4.1.3.  Holding Pattern.  Note the location of the holding pattern and its relation to the IAF.  It is extremely important that you review the altitude of the holding pattern at  the  IAF  and  determine  if  your  aircraft  can  meet  the  holding  speed  restrictions associated  with  that  altitude.    If  you  are  unable  to  comply  with  that  holding  speed, coordinate  with  ATC  prior  to  arriving  at  the  IAF  and  entering  holding.    You  could exit TERPS protected airspace if you fly faster than the holding pattern design speed. 6.5.4.1.4.  Plan  the  Approach.    Mentally  fly  the  approach  from  the  IAF  to  the  MAP and  determine  the  lead  points  for  radial,  course,  or  arc  interceptions.    Identify  the point where the aircraft should be configured for landing. 6.5.4.1.5.  Missed Approach.  Review the missed approach departure instructions and determine  if  your  aircraft  can  comply  with  the  required  climb  gradient  if  one  is published.  It is extremely important to review the Missed Approach holding pattern and determine if your aircraft can meet the holding speed restrictions associated with that  altitude.    If  you  are  unable  to  comply  with  the  holding  speed,  coordinate  with ATC  prior  to  arriving  at  the  IAF  and  commencing  the  approach.    If  you  lose communications  and  subsequently  execute the  published  missed  approach procedures, you could exit TERPS protected airspace if you fly faster than the missed approach  holding  pattern  was  designed  for.    Even  when  in  radio  contact,  waiting  to notify ATC of your requirement for alternate missed approach instructions, it may be too late for ATC to react and you could still exit protected airspace. 6.5.4.1.6.  Published  Routings.    Terminal  routings  from  en  route  or  feeder  facilities normally provide a course and range from the en route structure to the IAF but may take the aircraft to a point other than the IAF if operational circumstances so require  (Low altitude feeder routes provide minimum altitudes). 6.5.4.1.7.  Minimum  Safe/Sector  Altitudes.    Minimum  Safe  Altitudes  consist  of minimum  sector  altitudes  and  emergency  safe  altitudes.    When  more  than  one Minimum Safe Altitude is required, it is referred to as a Minimum Sector Altitude.  A minimum  safe  altitude  is  the  minimum  altitude  that  provides  at  least  1000  feet  of obstacle clearance for emergency use within a specified distance from the navigation facility upon which the  procedure is  based (for  example VORTAC, VOR, TACAN, NDB, or locator beacon at OM or MM).  The minimum sector altitude provides the 1000  feet  of  obstacle  clearance  within  25  NM  of  the  facility.    An  emergency  safe altitude is normally developed only for military procedures and will provide 1000 feet of obstacle clearance (2000 feet in designated mountainous areas) within 100 NM of the facility.  If it is not clear on which facility the altitude is based, a note should state the  facility  that  is  used.    Minimum  safe  altitudes  do  not  guarantee  NAVAID reception. 6.5.4.1.8.  Scale.    The  inner  ring  gives  a  scale  presentation  of  the  approach  that  is normally  within  a  10  NM  radius  for  low  altitude  approaches  and  20  NM  for  high altitude  approaches.    However,  it  should  be  noted  that  the  radius  of  the  rings  may differ.    Some,  but  not  necessarily  all,  obstacles  are  depicted.    This  inner  ring  is normally necessary for better portrayal  of the  IAP.  On  IAPs  with  a single ring, the entire plan view is to scale.  Instrument approach procedure plan views can use up to three  rings  to  show  the  approach  information  needed  for  the  IAP.    The  addition  of   106  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 outer or middle rings indicates that only approach information inside the inner ring is to scale. 6.5.4.2.  Profile View. 6.5.4.2.1.  Altitude Restrictions.  Note the altitude restrictions.  Minimum, maximum, mandatory, and recommended altitudes normally precede the fix or facility to which they  apply.    If  this  is  not  feasible,  an  arrow  will  indicate  exactly  where  the  altitude applies.  In some cases altitude restrictions are published in the plan view and not in the profile view.  This is often the case with multiple IAFs where it is not feasible to show all the routings in the profile view. 6.5.4.2.2.  Descent Gradients.  Consider the descent gradient.  For a low altitude IAP, the  initial  descent  gradient  will  not  exceed  500  ft/nm  (approximately  5°);  and  for  a high  altitude  approach,  the  maximum  allowable  initial  gradient  is  1,000  ft/nm (approximately 10°). 6.5.4.3.  Landing Minimums.  Review the landing minimums for your aircraft category to see how low  you can descend on the  approach and to  determine if the forecast  weather conditions will permit use of the IAP. 6.5.4.3.1.  NOTE:    The  minimums  published  in  FLIP  must  be  the  lowest  possible minimums  in  accordance  with  TERPS  criteria;  however,  MAJCOMs  may  establish higher minimums for their pilots.  The visibility values determine whether a straight-in  approach  may  be  flown.    These  values  are  based  on  all  approach  lighting  being operational.    When  approach  lighting  is  inoperative,  the  visibility  minimums  will normally be one-half mile higher or as listed in the airfield NOTAMS.  If a circling approach is  to  be flown, the weather must be at or above both the published ceiling and visibility. 6.5.4.3.2.  NOTE:    There  may  be  situations  when  you  are  required  to  fly  a  circling approach  which  does  not  have  a  ceiling  requirement  published.    In  this  case,  the required ceiling will be the HAA plus 100 feet rounded up to the next one hundred foot value.  For example, if the HAA is 757 feet, add 100 feet to get 857 feet and then round  up  to  the  nearest  one  hundred  foot  value,  which  would  be  900  feet.    Your ceiling for the approach must be at or above 900 feet. 6.5.4.4.  Aerodrome Sketch. 6.5.4.4.1.  Field elevation.  Check the field elevation.  This is the highest point on any usable landing surface. 6.5.4.4.2.  Touchdown zone elevation (TDZE).  Note the touchdown zone elevation.  This is the highest point in the first 3,000 feet of the landing surface. 6.5.4.4.3.  Runway.  Observe the runway dimensions and layout. 6.5.4.4.4.  Lighting systems.  Check the types of approach lighting systems available. 6.5.4.4.5.  Navigation  facility  location.    Note  the  direction  and  distance  of  the runways from the navigation facility. 6.5.4.4.6.  Obstructions.  Check the location of prominent obstructions. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   107  6.5.4.4.7.  Final  Approach  Direction.    The  arrow  shows  the  direction  the  final approach brings you in relation to the runway.  This information can help you know where to look for the runway.  It is also useful in determining how much maneuvering may  be  required  to  align  the  aircraft  with  the  runway.    A  straight-in  approach  may bring your aircraft to the runway as much as 30 degrees off of the runway centerline and still be considered a straight-in approach. 6.5.4.5.  Additional Information.  Look carefully for notes on the IAP.  Notes are used to identify  either  nonstandard  IAP  criteria  or  to  emphasize  areas  essential  for  the  safe completion of the approach.   or 6.5.4.6.  Alternate minimums.  Some civil and foreign approaches may have   NA in the remarks.  The   tells civilian pilots that the alternate minimums for the approach are  non-standard  and  they  must  look  in  the  front  of  the  IAP  book  for  new  alternate minimums.    Since  Air  Force  alternate  minimums  are  published  in  AFI  11-202V3,  Air Force pilots may disregard the weather minimums listed under the   NA does apply to USAF aircrews and has very serious implications.  The   NA tells civilian and military  pilots  that  the  specific  approach  cannot  be  used  to  qualify  the  field  as  an alternate  either  because  of  lack  of  weather  reporting  facilities  and/or  the  lack  of capability to monitor the NAVAID.  Without weather reporting facilities at the airport a pilot  will  not  be  able  to  get  a  specific  forecast  for  that  airport  as  required  by  AFI  11-202V3.  The lack of monitoring capability of the navigation facilities is a bigger problem.  Without a monitoring capability the pilot won't get any advance warning if the NAVAID is not operating.  This means if the NAVAID goes off the air, there is no one to issue a NOTAM to inform the pilot of the situation before an attempt is made to identify and use the NAVAID.  .  The 6.5.4.7.  Declared  Distances.    Declared  distances  are  normally  associated  with  airports affected by close-in development, or encroachment.  In order to maintain standard ―safety zones‖  around  runways,  the  airport  manager  may  implement  declared  distances  to artificially reduce the size of the runway for the purpose of increasing the distance from the runway to close-in encroachment.    Runways outside of the NAS and ICAO airports may  also  have  declared  distances.    These  may  not  be  indicated  on  the  IAP  or  airfield diagram,  and  additional  pre-flight  planning  may  be  required  to  determine  what  the distances are.  During mission planning, you will know if the airport you intent to transit has  declared  distances  assigned  if  you  see  a  black  square  with  a  white  D  (  D  )  on  the aerodrome  sketch  portion  of  the  approach  plate  and  the  Airport  Diagram.  Since  this symbol  is  in  negative  writing,  it  is  referred  to  as  the  ―Negative  D‖.      The  distances referred to by the ―Negative D‖ symbol are found in the NACO produced Airport/Facility Directory (A/FD) or region supplement, and in  the NGA-produced  IFR Supplement.    If checking the IFR Supplement, they are listed in the ―RMKS‖ section under the ―RSTD‖ title.  Declared distances do not affect the actual runway dimensions as published in the airport  sketch.    Declared  distances  for  takeoff  and  landing  are  not  provided  on  airport diagrams.  Stored  runway  data  in  the  FMS  NAV  database  does  not  include  declared distances. 6.5.4.7.1.  Declared  distances  include  the  following  four  terms  (which  may  or  may  not match the definitions in your aircraft performance manual).   108  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 6.5.4.7.1.1.  TORA.  TAKE-OFF  RUN  AVAILABLE-The  length  of  runway declared available and suitable for the ground run of an airplane take-off. 6.5.4.7.1.2.  TODA.    TAKE-OFF  DISTANCE  AVAILABLE-The  length  of  the takeoff run plus the length of the clearway, if provided. 6.5.4.7.1.3.  ASDA.   ACCELERATE-STOP  DISTANCE  AVAILABLE–The runway  plus  stopway  length  declared  available  and  suitable  for  the  acceleration and deceleration of an airplane aborting a takeoff. (A stopway is comparable to a US Military ―overrun‖; it is paved and weight-bearing). 6.5.4.7.1.4.  LDA.  LANDING DISTANCE AVAILABLE-The length of runway which is declared available and suitable for the ground run of an airplane landing. 6.5.4.7.2.  Declared distances are in place to meet certain FAA airport design criteria.  The Runway Safety Area, Runway Obstacle Free Area, and Runway Protection Zone affect  the  declared  distance  lengths  at  certain  airfields.  Declared  distances  are  a means of obtaining a standard safety area by  reducing the usable runway length.   A mathematical  method  is  used  to  determine  runway  length  available.    For  more information on declared distance standards, see FAA AC 150/5300-13.  It may not be possible  for  transiting  aircrews  to  know  specifically  why  declared  distances  are published as they are.   USAF aircrews  must  adhere to  Declared Distances  to  meet the FAA’s intent of providing the best possible safety areas around the runway. 6.5.4.7.2.1.  Some  runway  elements  associated  with  declared  distances  may  be identifiable  through  runway  markings  or  lighting  (displaced  threshold  or    a designated  overrun  or  stopway),  but    the  individual  declared  distance  limits  are not marked or otherwise identified on the runway.  Further, aircrews are reminded that  climb  gradient  restrictions  are  generated  from  the  physical  departure  end  of the runway, not necessarily any specific declared distance. 6.5.4.7.2.2.  Takeoff  and  Landing  Data  (TOLD)  correctly  computed  from  the aircraft  performance  manual  gives  the  aircrew  the  distance  requirements  for takeoff  and  landing.    PICs  will  ensure  TOLD  computations  for  the  aircraft’s takeoff  ground  run,  or  landing  distance,  falls  within  the  published  declared distances before the pilot accepts that runway for takeoff or landing. 6.5.4.7.2.2.1.  NOTE:  As long as TOLD calculations fall within the Declared Distance limitations, a USAF aircrew may operate beyond a declared distance limit  during  any  takeoff,  landing  or  taxi  operation,  provided  the  runway surface  is  appropriately  marked  as  usable  runway.    Therefore,  when  aircraft weight,  configuration,  and  environmental  factors  allow  the  aircraft  TOLD  to meet  Declared  Distance  limits,  USAF  pilots  may  operate  normally  on  the runway. 6.5.4.7.3.  USAF  Aircrews  should  apply  declared  distance  information  in  the following manner: 6.5.4.7.3.1.  TORA:  PICs must  operate their  aircraft at  a weight  that makes  it POSSIBLE  to  be  airborne  at  or  before  the  TORA  distance  and  then  meet  or exceed  the  published  climb  gradient.    Normally,  the  published  climb  gradient AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   109  starts at the end of the published physical runway length, at the appropriate screen height. 6.5.4.7.3.2.  TODA:    PICs  will  not  incorporate  TODA  into  planning,  but  will instead  be  limited  by  TORA.    If  TODA  is  longer  than  the  depicted  physical runway length, it has taken a clearway into account.   Certain non-USAF turbine powered  aircraft  use  it  in  their  TOLD.  Clearways  are  NOT  paved  nor  are  they weight-bearing surfaces. 6.5.4.7.3.3.  ASDA:    PICs  will  use  ASDA  when  computing  a  refusal  speed  (if applicable),  as  it  provides  information  on  stressed  pavement  available  for stopping.    If  using  the  balanced  field  concept  for  takeoff,  ASDA  must  be compared to TORA, and the shorter of the two used when computing TOLD. 6.5.4.7.3.4.  LDA:    PICs  will  land  at  a  weight  and  configuration  that  makes  it POSSIBLE to touchdown and stop within the LDA.   LDA starts at the approach end  threshold  or  displaced  threshold.  However,  the  full  length  of  the  runway,  if appropriately  marked  and  available,  may  be  used  for  roll-out  and  runway  exit, given the aircraft is capable of complying with the published LDA. 6.5.4.7.4.  Touch and go operations at airfields with declared distances: 6.5.4.7.4.1.  When  considering  whether  the  aircraft  can  safely  accomplish  touch and goes, at  a field with declared distances, the PIC should treat the takeoff and landing  as  separate  operations.  Therefore,  for  the  landing,  aircraft  TOLD  must allow  it  to  land,  and  stop,  within  the  declared  LDA  for  that  runway.    For  the takeoff,  aircraft  TOLD  must  permit  it  to  takeoff  with  the  published  TORA  and ASDA—computed as if it were the initial takeoff operation at that field.  Again, if using  balanced  field  method  of  calculating  TOLD  for  takeoff,  use  the  shorter  of TORA or ASDA. 6.5.4.7.4.2.  As  long  as  the  PIC  confirms  the  aircraft‘s  weight  and  configuration make it POSSIBLE to make an initial takeoff and a full stop within that runway‘s declared  distances  (treated  as  separate  operations),  touch  and  goes  are  permitted on that runway.  Since the PIC ensured compliance with all declared distances, it would then be permissible for the PIC to use the physical length of the runway for a  touch  and  go  just  as  at  any  other  runway.    Finally,  the  full  physical  runway length must meet the aircraft‘s flight manual and AFI 11-2MDSV3 series required runway length for touch and go operations. 6.5.5.  Reviewing  a  Radar  Approach.    Depictions  of  radar  approaches  are  not  normally included in flight publications, but some important aspects of the approach are available. 6.5.5.1.  IAP.    It  is  helpful  to  review  a  published  IAP  for  the  airfield.    In  addition  to helping you prepare for a backup approach in the event of radio failure, the IAP provides: 6.5.5.1.1.  NAVAIDs.    NAVAID  frequencies  and  locations  for  position  orientation and, in some cases, additional voice reception capability. 6.5.5.1.2.  Altitudes.  Minimum safe altitudes in the terminal area.   110  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 6.5.5.1.3.  Stepdown  altitudes.    A  stepdown  altitude  between  the  nonprecision  FAF and  MAP  that  may  alert  you  to  the  possibility  of  a  stepdown  on  an  airport surveillance radar (ASR) approach to the same runway. 6.5.5.1.4.  Radar minimums.  Depiction of radar minimums and the glide slope angle.  Normally the precision approach radar (PAR) glide slope will coincide with the ILS glide slope. 6.5.5.1.5.  Airport sketch.  The airport sketch and all the information associated with it. 6.5.5.2.  Operating  hours.    The  IAP  books  contain  complete  radar  minimums.    The  IFR Supplement contains time periods when the aerodrome and its NAVAIDs are operational.  It  also  indicates  when  NAVAIDs  will  be  off  the  air  for  NO-NOTAM  preventive maintenance, as well as other items unique to the particular operation of the airfield. 6.5.6.  Reviewing  RNAV (GPS) IAPs.  The following section highlights elements of RNAV (GPS) IAPs that differ from IAPs based on conventional NAVAIDs. 6.5.6.1.  Equipment  requirements.    The  ―TERMS/LANDING  MINIMUMS  DATA‖ (Section A) of the U.S. Government Terminal Procedures books provide a description of the aircraft equipment requirements for RNAV (GPS) IAPs.  More detailed information can  be  obtained  via  the  AFFSA  web  page.    Pilots  are  responsible  for  ensuring  that  the aircraft  is  suitably  equipped  for  the  level  of  minimums  used.    Be  aware  that  very  few RNAV  (GPS)  IAPs  may  be  flown  using  DME/DME  RNAV  systems.    Note  that  the ―(GPS)‖ in the approach title does not indicate the approach may be flown in aircraft with any  GPS  equipment.    GPS  equipped  aircraft  must  meet  the  equipment  requirements described in AFI 11-202V3 and FAA AC 91-100A. 6.5.6.1.1.  Use of LNAV/VNAV DA requires certified VNAV functionality or WAAS on  the  aircraft.  Use  of  LPV  (see  6.5.6.3.3  below)  minimums  requires  WAAS equipment on the aircraft. 6.5.6.2.  Procedure name.  Where multiple RNAV procedures exist to the same runway, subsequent  RNAV  procedure  titles  will  be  followed  by  the  suffix  X,  Y,  or  Z  (e.g., ―RNAV (GPS) Z RWY 22‖).  ATC clearance for the RNAV procedure will authorize the pilot  to  use  any  landing  minimums  for  which  the  pilot  and/or  aircraft  is  capable  and authorized. 6.5.6.3.  Chart Terminology. 6.5.6.3.1.  Decision  Altitude  (DA).    On  some  approaches,  DA  replaces  the  familiar term  Decision  Height  (DH).    DA  conforms  to  the  international  convention  where altitudes relate to MSL (i.e. referenced on a pressure altimeter) and heights relate to AGL.    DA    is  the  correct  terminology  for  CAT  I  ILS,  CAT  II  ILS  with  RA-NA published,  LNAV/VNAV,  LPV etc.    The published descent  profile is  flown to  the DA, where a missed approach will be initiated if visual references for landing are not established.  Obstacle clearance criteria accounts for a momentary descent below DA while  transitioning  to  the  missed  approach.    Decision  Height  is  a  height  above touchdown referenced by a RADAR altimeter and should only be referenced for CAT AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   111  II/III ILS or those procedures using a RADAR altimeter to define minimums/decision points. 6.5.6.3.2.  Minimum Descent Altitude (MDA).  MDA carries the same meaning as in conventional  IAPs,  and  is  associated  with  LNAV  minimums.    Obstacle  clearance  is based on no descent below MDA.   Thus, if vertical guidance is used down to LNAV minimums, pilots must ensure that the descent is broken in time to level off at MDA if visual references for landing are not established. 6.5.6.3.3.  LPV.  Localizer Performance with Vertical Guidance (LPV) minimums are based  on  augmented  GPS  systems  (WAAS)  providing  near  ILS  accuracy.    LPV minima can be as low as a DA(H) of 250 feet above the ground, with visibility as low as 1/2 mile. 6.5.6.3.4.  Minimums:  RNAV  instrument  approach  procedure  charts  incorporate  all types of approaches using Area Navigation systems, both ground and satellite based.  The  approach  charts  may  contain  as  many  as  four  lines  of  approach  minimums:  Lateral  Navigation  (LNAV);  LNAV/Vertical  Navigation  (VNAV)  (LNAV/VNAV); GNSS  Landing  System  (GLS),  also  known  as  LPV;  and  Circling.    The  minima  are dependent on the navigational equipment capability as outlined in the Terms/Landing Minima Data section at the front of the approach plate book.  Typically, the approach chart  will  indicate  the  equipment  required  for  the  approach,  i.e.  GPS  or  RNP-.03 Required (Figure 6.14).   112  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 Figure 6.14.  RNAV (GPS) Approach Minimums.  6.5.6.3.4.1.  LNAV.    These  minimums  are  for  LNAV  (lateral)  –only  guidance. Because  vertical  guidance  is  not  provided,  the  procedure  minimum  altitude  will be published as a MDA.  With an approved VNAV system, VNAV guidance may be used if provided by the RNAV system as long as the aircraft is level  prior to MDA. 6.5.6.3.4.2.  LNAV/VNAV.    LNAV/VNAV  minimums  are  based  on  lateral  and vertical guidance to the published DA. 6.5.6.3.4.2.1.  NOTE:    Barometric  VNAV  (BARO-VNAV)  systems  compute a  vertical  path  based  on  aircraft  barometric  altimetry  systems.    This  vertical path  may  be  greatly  affected  by  non-standard  temperatures,  incorrect  or rapidly changing altimeter settings, and altimeter error.  Pilots should closely monitor  compliance  with  step  down  fix  altitude  constraints  and  may  not  use Baro-VNAV  guidance  for  reference  below  the  published  DA.  Also  note  that AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   113  deviations  from  the  VNAV  path  are  often  linear  as  opposed  to  angular,  i.e. one  dot  deviation  represents  a  fixed  number  of  feet  from  the  vertical  path, regardless of distance to the runway waypoint. 6.5.6.3.4.2.2.  LPV minimums.  LPV minimums may support precision approach minimums as low as 200' HAT and 1/2 statute mile (SM) visibility. Pilots will be informed that the notation ―LPV PA‖ or ―GLS‖ on the first line of minimums in U.S.  Government  Terminal  Procedure  Publication  charts  satisfies  all  the requirements  of  the  precision  system.  Pilots  will  be  informed  that  the  precision system requirements are  not met by the notation  "LPV" without the letters "PA" on  the  first  line  of  minimums.  In  this  latter  case,  since  the  landing  environment does not support the low visibility operations, minimums no lower than 300' HAT and  3/4  SM  visibility  will  be  published.  LPV  minimums  are  published  as  a Decision Altitude (DA). Figure 6.15.  RNAV (GPS) Chart Symbology. 6.5.7.  Chart Symbology (Figure 6.15).    114  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 6.5.7.1.  Descent  Angle.    The  RNAV  (GPS)  IAP  format  provides  descent  angle  to  the hundredth  of  a  degree  (e.g.,  3.00°),  with  a  range  from  2.75°  to  3.5°.    The  angle  is provided in the graphically depicted descent profile.  The optimum RNAV (GPS) descent angle is 3.00°. 6.5.7.1.1.  For  RNP  and  WAAS  approaches  just  now  being  fielded,  the  minimum descent  angle  is  still  2.75°.    However,  the  maximum  angle  is  based  on  aircraft category as shown in the table below. Table 6.2.  Maximum Descent Angle for RNP and WAAS Approaches. Aircraft Category Maximum Descent CAT A (less than 80 kts) CAT A (81-90 kts) CAT B CAT C CAT D and E Angle 6.4 Degrees 5.7 Degrees 4.2 Degrees 3.6 Degrees 3.1 Degrees 6.5.7.2.  Threshold  Crossing  Height  (TCH).    The  concept  of  TCH  is  the  same  as  in conventional  IAPs.   On  RNAV (GPS)  IAPs,  TCH refers to  the point where the descent angle  crosses  above  the  threshold.    Unless  required  by  larger  type  aircraft,  the  typical TCH will be 30-50 feet. 6.5.7.3.  VDP.  The VDP on an RNAV (GPS) IAP only pertains to aircraft using LNAV minimums (not LNAV/VNAV or LPV).  The VDP will be accompanied by the notation ―*LNAV only.‖ 6.5.7.4.  Missed Approach Symbology. In addition to a textual description of the missed approach  procedure  in  the  ―pilot  briefing‖  at  the  top  of  the  IAP,  missed  approach instructions  will  be  graphically  depicted  in  the  profile  view.    Up  to  four  icons  will  be shown.    These  icons  are  intended  only  for  quick  reference  and  may  not  depict  the  full missed approach procedure. 6.5.7.5.  Waypoints.  Two types of waypoints appear in  RNAV procedures  – ―fly-over‖ and  ―fly-by‖  waypoints.    ―Fly-by‖  waypoints  will  be  depicted  using  the  standard  WP symbol.    Turn  anticipation  is  allowed  for  fly-by  waypoints.    Fly-over  waypoints  are indicated by the standard waypoint symbol enclosed in a circle.  For a fly-over WP, turn anticipation is not allowed.  No turn may be accomplished until the aircraft passes over the  waypoint.    Note:  A  "Fly  By"  vertical  waypoint  is  a  WP  for  which  an  aircraft  may initiate a vertical rate change and depart the specified vertical path to the active WP prior to  reaching  that  WP,  in  order  to  asymptotically  capture  the  next  vertical  path.    A  "Fly Over" vertical  waypoint is  a WP for which an aircraft must stay on the defined vertical path until passing the active WP, and may not initiate the necessary vertical rate change to capture the next vertical path until after passing the active WP.  Hence, after passing the active WP, as the next WP becomes active, and if there is a vertical path change, then the aircraft must re-adjust vertical rate to re-capture the vertical path after having already overshot the first opportunity for an asymptotic capture of that new path. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   115  6.5.7.6.  Approach  waypoints,  except  for  the  MAWP  and  the  missed  approach  holding waypoint (MAHWP), are normally fly-by waypoints.  Overlay approach charts and some early stand alone GPS approach charts may not reflect this convention. 6.5.7.7.  Pilots may see terminal 5 letter waypoints outside the U.S.  The first 2 letters are airport ID, third letter is cardinal direction from airfield and the fourth/fifth positions are sequential numbers.  Approach waypoints may use 4 or 5 alphanumeric characters, where first 3 characters represent runway designation (e.g., 24L, where C/L/R is optional), the fourth  character  is  G  for  waypoint-type  code  and  last  digit  is  for  uniqueness  (e.g., 24LG2). 6.5.7.8.  Pilot  Briefing  Area.    The  pilot  briefing  consolidates,  in  one  location,  pertinent information  needed  to  conduct  the  approach.    It  includes  final  approach  course, runway/airport  data,  procedure  restrictions,  approach  light  data,  missed  approach  text, WAAS and BARO-VNAV information, and various NAVAID/ATC radio frequencies. 6.5.7.8.1.  Cold  Temperature  Limitations.    The  upper  left  hand  area  of  the  pilot briefing  lists  the  airport  temperature  below  which  BARO-VNAV  will  not  be authorized  to  LNAV/VNAV  minimums.    Cold  weather  corrections  should  still  be applied to all barometrically derived approach minimums and step-down altitudes, whether  Baro-VNAV  is  used  or  not.    (Use  of  barometric  VNAV  DA  is  not authorized with a remote altimeter setting.) 6.5.7.9.  Terminal  Arrival  Areas  (TAA)  (Figure  6.16).  The  standard  TAA  consists  of three areas defined by the extension of the IAF legs and the intermediate segment course. These  areas  are  called  the  straight-in,  left-base,  and  right-base  areas.    TAA  area  lateral boundaries are identified by magnetic courses TO the IF (IAF). The straight-in area can be  further  divided  into  pie-shaped  sectors  with  the  boundaries  identified  by  magnetic courses  TO  the  IF  (IAF),  and  may  contain  stepdown  sections  defined  by  arcs  based  on RNAV distances (DME or along track distance (ATD)) from the IF (IAF). The right/left-base areas can only be subdivided using arcs based on RNAV distances from the IAFs for those  areas.  Minimum  MSL  altitudes  are  charted  within  each  of  these  defined areas/subdivisions  that  provide  at  least  1,000  feet  of  obstacle  clearance,  or  more  as necessary in mountainous areas.   116  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 Figure 6.16.  Terminal Arrival Area (TAA).  6.5.8.  Reviewing  GPS  instrument  approaches.    AFI  11-202V3  lists  specific  equipment requirements for GPS stand-alone and overlay instrument approaches. 6.5.8.1.  RNAV (GPS) Approaches (Figure 6.17).  RNAV (GPS) stand-alone approaches are constructed specifically for use by RNAV and/or GPS equipped aircraft and are not based on ground based NAVAIDS.  RNAV (GPS) stand-alone approaches are identified by  the  absence  of  other  NAVAIDS  in  the  approach  title,  for  example  GPS  RWY  35  or RNAV  (GPS)  RWY  35.    RNAV  (GPS)  approaches  are  authorized  in  IMC  for appropriately equipped and certified USAF aircraft. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   117  Figure 6.17.  Stand Alone GPS Approach.  6.5.8.2.  Approaches  where  ‖or  GPS"  is  included  in  the  title  of  the  procedure  are retrievable  from  the  database  (e.g.,  "VOR  or  GPS  RWY  35")(Figure  6.18).    USAF aircraft may fly these approaches in VMC or IMC if the approach was constructed by a US TERPS authority (USAF/FAA/USN).    For approaches without ―or GPS‖ in the title, see RNAV substitution discussion below. 6.5.8.2.1.  NOTE:    When  retrieving  an  ―or  GPS‖  approach  from  the  navigation database,  it  will  be  titled  in  the  database  by  the  title  of  the  conventional  NAVAID.  For  example:    VOR  or  GPS  Rwy  5  will  be  titled  in  the  aircraft  database  as  ―VOR Rwy  5‖.    The  title  on  the  published  IAP  chart  determines  the  type  of  approach,  not how it is named in the aircraft database.   118  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 Figure 6.18.  “or GPS” Approach.  6.5.8.2.2.  Procedures Without a Final Approach Fix.  Procedures without a FAF and without a stepdown fix have a Sensor FAF waypoint coded in the database at least 4 NM Actual Track Distance (ATD) to the MAP waypoint.  The MAP, in this case, is always located at the NAVAID facility.  A Sensor FAF is a final approach waypoint created and added to the database sequence of waypoints to support GPS navigation of an FAA or DoD published, no-FAF, nonprecision instrument approach procedure.  The coded name or Sensor FAF appears in the waypoint sequence.  If a stepdown fix exists  on  the  published  procedure  and  it  is  greater  than  2  NM  to  the  MAP,  the stepdown fix is coded in the database as the Sensor FAF waypoint for the waypoint sequence.    If  a  stepdown  fix  distance  is  2  NM  or  less  to  the  MAP,  a  Sensor  FAF waypoint is coded at least 4 NM to the MAP. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   119  6.5.8.3.  RNP  SAAAR  Approaches  (Figure  6.19).    USAF  pilots  shall  not  fly  these procedures  until  completing  MAJCOM-defined  training  and  certification.      SAAAR procedures  are  to  be  conducted  by  aircrews  meeting  special  training  requirements  in aircraft that meet the specified performance and functional requirements.  RNP SAAAR approaches  are  clearly  marked  with  (RNP)  in  the  instrument  procedure  name  and SPECIAL  AIRCRAFT  AND  AIRCREW  AUTHORIZATION  REQUIRED  in  the comment block. Figure 6.19.  RNP SAAAR. 6.5.8.4.  RNAV  Substitution.    IAW  AFI  11-202V3,  for  procedures  developed  by  a  US TERPS authority (FAA/USAF/USN), MAJCOM-approved suitable RNAV systems may be used as a substitute means of navigation for a named fix, VOR, TACAN, NDB, DME    120  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 or  compass  locator.    In  such  terminal  areas,  following  a  successful  predictive  RAIM check,  approved  RNAV  systems  may  be  substituted  for  required  NAVAIDS  or  named fixes  on  arrivals,  departures,  and  non-localizer  based  instrument  procedures.    Any  such substitution  must  be  extracted  from  a  current  database.    These  operations  are  allowable even when a facility is explicitly identified as required on a procedure (e.g., ―Note ADF required‖), but not if the procedure is NOTAM‘ed as NA. Pilots using approved RNAV systems  as  a  substitute  means  of  navigation  guidance  in  lieu  of  an  out  of  service NAVAID  should  advise  ATC  of  this  intent  and  capability.    Pilots  will  tune,  identify, monitor and display the appropriate ground-based NAVAIDs whenever practicable. 6.5.9.  Relationship of Avionics Displayed Waypoints to Charted Data.  The GPS Approach Overlay  Program  waypoints  contained  in  the  database  represent  the  waypoints,  fixes, NAVAIDs,  and  other  points  portrayed  on  a  published  approach  procedure  beginning  at  the initial  approach  fix.   Certain  unnamed  points  and  fixes  appearing  on  a  chart  are  assigned  a database  identifier.    Although  there  currently  is  no  requirement  to  provide  these  database identifiers,  most  charting  agencies  are  publishing  them  at  their  discretion.    Database identifiers should not be used for pilot/controller communications or on flight plans. 6.6.  Instrument  Cockpit  Check.  Before  flight,  accomplish  a  thorough  instrument  cockpit check.    You  should  check  the  applicable  items  listed  below  (unless  your  flight  manual  or command directives dictate otherwise): 6.6.1.  Publications.  Ensure appropriate, up-to-date publications obtained from an authorized source are in the aircraft. 6.6.1.1.  If  you  are  authorized  to  carry  Jeppesen  products,  ensure  you  have  Book  1 (summary,  notices,  legend  information,  etc.)  and  ALL  the  pages  for  the  appropriate airport.    Important  information  is  contained  on  the  back  of  the  airfield  diagram  page.  Radio out procedures are often contained on a different page from the IAP you are using.  Without Book 1 and all the pages for the airport, you may miss crucial information. 6.6.1.2.  Host  nation  FLIP  documents,  enroute  charts,  IAPs,  etc,  will  not  be  used without MAJCOM approval IAW AFI 11-202V3. 6.6.2.  Pitot Heat.  Check for proper operation. 6.6.3.  ADIs. 6.6.3.1.  Erect.  Ensure it is erect and that the bank pointer is aligned vertically with the zero bank index.  Check your flight manual for tolerance limits. 6.6.3.2.  Flags.  Ensure the warning flags are not visible. 6.6.3.3.  Alignment.  Check the pitch trim knob alignment and ensure it is within limits, then set the miniature aircraft or horizon bar for takeoff. 6.6.4.  Magnetic Compass.  Check the accuracy of heading information. 6.6.5.  Clock.  Ensure the clock is running and the correct time is set. 6.6.6.  VVI.  Ensure the pointer is at zero.  If the indicator does not return to zero, adjust it with a small screwdriver or use the ground indication as the zero position in flight. 6.6.7.  Altimeters. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   121  6.6.7.1.  Current setting.  Set current altimeter setting on barometric scale. 6.6.7.2.  Known elevation.  Check the altimeter at a known elevation and note any error in feet.  If the error exceeds 75 feet, the instrument is out of tolerance for flight. 6.6.7.3.  Check  pointers.    Ensure  the  10,000/1000/100  counter-drum-pointers  indicate approximate  field  elevation.    Check  and  ensure  the  low  altitude  warning  symbol  is  in view. 6.6.7.4.  Modes.    Check  both  reset  and  standby  modes  on  AIMS  altimeter  and  set  in accordance with the flight manual or command directives. 6.6.7.4.1.  NOTE:  Helicopter rotor operation may affect altimeter indications.  Check individual helicopter flight manual for altimeter limitations if published. 6.6.8.  Turn and Slip Indicator. 6.6.8.1.  Turn  needle.    Check  and  ensure  the  turn  needle  indicates  proper  direction  of turn. 6.6.8.2.  Ball.  Check the ball for freedom of movement in the glass tube. 6.6.9.  Heading Indicators. 6.6.9.1.  Accuracy.    Check  the  accuracy  of  heading  information.    In  lieu  of  guidance  in aircraft  technical  orders  the  aircraft's  primary  heading  indicator  should  be  within approximately 5 degrees of a known heading (i.e., runway heading or designated ground checkpoint). 6.6.9.2.  Indicators.  Ensure the heading indicators indicate correct movement in turns. 6.6.9.3.  Set.  Set adjustable heading indicators to the desired heading. 6.6.9.4.  Bank  steering.    For  flight  director  systems,  check  the  bank  steering  bar  for proper commands in the heading mode. 6.6.10.  Airspeed and Mach Indicators. 6.6.10.1.  Set.  Set the airspeed or command mach markers as desired or as directed in the flight manual. 6.6.10.2.  Indicators.  Check the pointers or rotating airspeed scale for proper indications. 6.6.11.  Airspeed Mach Indicator (AMI). 6.6.11.1.  Airspeed Warning Flag.  Ensure it is out of view. 6.6.11.2.  Command  Airspeed  Marker.    Set  the  marker  as  desired;  that  is,  decision, rotation, climb speed, etc. 6.6.12.  Altitude Vertical Velocity Indicator (AVVI) 6.6.12.1.  Vertical velocity.  Check for zero indication. 6.6.12.2.  Altimeter.    Make  same  check  as  for  conventional  altimeter.  Ensure  warning flag is out of view. 6.6.12.3.  Command  Altitude  Marker.  Set  the  command  altitude  marker  as  desired;  that is, first anticipated level off, emergency return DH/MDA, etc.   122  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 6.6.12.3.1.  CAUTION:  The  command  airspeed  or  altitude  slewing  switches  should not  be  placed  in  the  side  detent  position  for  takeoff  due  to  the  possibility  of misreading those instruments. 6.6.13.  Navigation Equipment and Instruments. 6.6.13.1.  Tune and identify. 6.6.13.2.  Pointers. Ensure the bearing pointers point to the station. 6.6.13.3.  Flags. Check and ensure the range warning flag on the range indicator is out of view and the distance indicated is within one-half mile or 3 percent of the distance to the facility, whichever is greater. 6.6.13.4.  Course  set  knob.    Rotate  the  course  set  knob  and  check  for  proper  CDI displacement. 6.6.13.5.  To-from.  Rotate the course set knob and check that the TO-FROM indication changes when the selected course is approximately 90° to the bearing pointer. 6.6.13.6.  Designated  checkpoints.    When  checking  the  VOR/TACAN  at  a  designated ground  checkpoint,  the  allowable  CDI  error  is  ±4°  and  the  CDI  and  bearing  pointer should  agree  within  the  tolerances  specified  for  the  aircraft.  Ensure  that  distance indicated is within one-half mile or 3% of the distance designated on the checkpoint. 6.6.13.7.  Dual  systems.    If  the  aircraft  has  dual  VOR  or  dual  TACAN  receivers,  the systems  are  considered  reliable  for  instrument  flight  if  they  check  within  ±4°  of  each other.  However, if the VOR/TACAN is also checked at a designated ground checkpoint, the equipment must meet the requirement in the above bullet. 6.6.13.7.1.  NOTE: The self-test mode incorporated into some VOR/TACAN/ILS sets provides an operational test of the set.  The self-test does not, however, provide a test of the aircraft antennas.  If the VOR/TACAN set self-test function checks within the aircraft's flight manual tolerances and the VOR/TACAN station identifier is received, the requirements of the paragraph above are satisfied. 6.6.13.8.  VOR Test Facility (VOT).  VOT is an FAA facility that transmits a test signal for either a ground or airborne operational test of VOR equipment. 6.6.13.8.1.  When using a VOT on the ground, allowable error is ±4 degrees.  When using an airborne VOT, allowable error is ±6 degrees. 6.6.13.8.2.  Airborne  checks  using  a  VOT  are  limited  to  those  areas/altitudes specifically authorized. 6.6.13.8.3.  VOT  frequencies  are  listed  in  the  NAVAIDS  section  of  the  Enroute Supplement entry for each airport and on the air/ground voice communications panels on the Enroute Low Altitude charts and Area charts. 6.6.13.8.4.  When  using  a  VOT  to  test  VOR  equipment,  accomplish  the  following procedures: 6.6.13.8.4.1.  Tune the appropriate VOT frequency on your VOR receiver. 6.6.13.8.4.2.  With  the  CDI  centered,  the  Omni  Bearing  Selector  (OBS)  should AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   123  read 0 degrees with a ―from‖ indication; or the OBS should read 180 degrees with a ―to‖ indication.  The RMI will indicate 180 degrees regardless of OBS setting. 6.6.13.8.4.3.  Identify  the  VOT  station  by  listening  for  a  series  of  dots  or  a continuous tone. 6.6.13.9.  Other  equipment.    Check  all  other  flight  and  navigation  instruments  and equipment for proper operation and accurate information. 6.6.13.10.  GPS  Navigation  Database:    Ensure  the  GPS  navigation  database  is  current.  See AFI 11-202V3 for current database restrictions. 6.7.  IFR Flight in Uncontrolled Airspace. 6.7.1.  Uncontrolled airspace is that airspace not otherwise designated as controlled airspace.  There is little uncontrolled airspace within the CONUS.  However, once outside the CONUS, there can be significant areas of uncontrolled, or Class G, airspace. 6.7.1.1.  FAA  controllers  will  only  assign  an  IFR  route  through  Class  G  airspace  when requested by the pilot. 6.7.1.2.  For IFR flights in Class G airspace outside the CONUS, consult the appropriate FLIP AP volume, NOTAMs, and local procedures for any specific instructions unique to each theater, area, country, or airport. 6.7.2.  IFR  operations  are  permitted  in  uncontrolled  airspace.    All  normal  IFR  equipment requirements and rules apply to include minimum altitude and flight levels. 6.7.2.1.  While  operating  in  VMC,  pilots  are  solely  responsible  to  see  and  avoid  other traffic, terrain, and obstacles. 6.7.2.2.  While operating under IFR in Class G airspace, pilots must strictly maintain the correct altitude for the direction of flight. 6.7.3.  Air  traffic  control  only  provides  separation  between  aircraft  in  controlled  airspace.  Therefore,  caution  should  be  exercised  when  operating  in  IMC  under  IFR  in  uncontrolled airspace. 6.8.  Instrument Approaches to Uncontrolled Airports. 6.8.1.  Instrument  approaches  to  uncontrolled airports  are authorized for USAF aircrews unless otherwise restricted by MAJCOM.  For VFR procedures at uncontrolled airports, see AFMAN 11-217 Volume 2, Visual Flight Procedures. 6.8.2.  All  operations  at  uncontrolled  airports  require  additional  vigilance  on  the  part  of  the aircrew.    Conducting  instrument  approaches  at  uncontrolled  airports  are  especially challenging as the ground track of the instrument approach may not coincide with the ground tracks  of  the  VFR  traffic  pattern,  the  instrument  approach  may  not  terminate  at  the  active runway, altitudes may not coincide with the prevailing traffic patterns, and not all VFR pilots are  familiar  with  the  instrument  approach  procedures  at  the  airport.    Aircrews  must thoroughly  brief  reporting  procedures  and  crew  coordination  procedures  prior to accomplishing an instrument approach at an uncontrolled airport. 6.8.2.1.  A critical  point  to  remember is  that any  person on the  ground providing traffic advisories at a non-towered airport is only providing advisories.  Personnel on the ground   124  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 are not air traffic controllers.  Pilots operating at uncontrolled airports are responsible for their own traffic avoidance, sequencing, and separation. 6.8.2.2.  Pilots  conducting  actual  or  practice  instrument  approaches  at  uncontrolled airports must be especially vigilant for traffic departing in the opposite direction. 6.8.3.  Common  Traffic  Advisory  Frequency  (CTAF).    The  CTAF  is  a  frequency  designed for  the  purpose  of  carrying  out  airport  advisory  practices  while  operating  to  or  from  an airport  without an operating  control tower.   The  CTAF may  be a  UNICOM, MULTICOM, FSS, or tower frequency and is identified on the approach plate. 6.8.3.1.  A UNICOM is a non-governmental communication facility, which may provide airport  information.    The  frequency  will  be  published  on  the  approach  plate  as ―UNICOM‖.  Many times these radios are located in the airport office or at a fixed base operator (FBO). 6.8.3.2.  A  MULTICOM  is  a  mobile  service  not  open  to  public  correspondence  used  to provide  communications  essential  to  conduct  the  activities  being  performed  by  or directed from private aircraft. Where there is no tower, FSS, or UNICOM station on the airport, use MULTICOM frequency 122.9. 6.8.3.3.  A  FSS  physically  located  on  an  airport  may  provide  airport  advisory  service (AAS) at an airport that does not have a control tower or where a tower is operated on a part-time basis and the tower is not in operation. 6.8.3.4.  When  a  control  tower  is  not  operational  24  hours  a  day,  the  CTAF  frequency will normally be the same as the tower frequency listed on the approach plate and will be annotated, ―TOWER (CTAF).‖ 6.8.4.  There  are  two  ways  for  pilots  to  communicate  their  intentions  and  obtain airport/traffic information when operating at an airport that does not have an operating tower: by communicating with an FSS that is providing airport advisories on a CTAF or by making a self-announced broadcast on the CTAF. 6.8.4.1.  A  FSS  provides  pilots  with  wind  direction  and  velocity,  favored  or  designated runway,  altimeter  setting,  known  traffic,  NOTAMs,  airport  taxi  routes,  airport  traffic pattern, and instrument approach procedures information. Pilots may receive some or all of these elements depending on the current traffic situation. Some airport managers have specified  that  under  certain  wind  or  other  conditions,  designated  runways  are  used. Therefore, pilots should advise the FSS of the runway they intend to use. It is important to note that not all aircraft in the vicinity of an airport may be in communication with the FSS. 6.8.4.2.  "Self-announce" is a procedure whereby pilots broadcast their position, intended flight  activity  or  ground  operation  on  the  designated  CTAF.  This  procedure  is  used primarily at airports that do not have a control tower or an FSS on the airport. The self-announce procedure should also be used when a pilot is unable to communicate with the local FSS on the designated CTAF. 6.8.5.  Communication at Uncontrolled Airports. 6.8.5.1.  Aircraft operating on an IFR flight plan, landing at an uncontrolled airport will be advised to ―Change to advisory frequency‖, when direct ATC communications are no AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   125  longer  required.    When  directed,  pilots  should  expeditiously  change  to  the  CTAF frequency, as the ATC facility will not have runway in use or airport traffic information. 6.8.5.2.  Inbound aircraft should initiate contact approximately 10 miles from the airport and  continue  to  monitor  the  appropriate  frequency  until  after  landing  and  clear  of  the movement area. 6.8.5.2.1.  NOTE:   If  your aircraft only has one  radio  capable of transmitting on the ATC and CTAF frequency, do not leave the assigned ATC frequency until instructed to do so. 6.8.5.3.  Inbounds should report altitude, aircraft type, and location relative to the airport; should  indicate  whether  landing  or  over  flight;  and  should  request  airport  advisory  (if UNICOM or FSS). 6.8.5.4.  Make position reports at the following locations on the approach. 6.8.5.4.1.  When departing the final approach fix inbound; 6.8.5.4.2.  When  established  on  the  final  approach  segment  or  immediately  upon being released by ATC; 6.8.5.4.3.  Upon completion or termination of the approach; and 6.8.5.4.4.  Upon executing the missed approach procedure. 6.8.5.4.5.  When exiting the active runway. 6.8.5.4.5.1.  NOTE:  It is important to remember that most VFR pilots operating in the vicinity of the airport will not be familiar with fix names.  Location should be  referred  to  in  the  simplest  terms  the  average  VFR  pilot  will  understand.    For example, use the terminology ―5 miles south‖ instead of ―Kirby Intersection‖. 6.8.5.5.  When self-announcing your position, insure you use the following format: 6.8.5.5.1.  Name of the airport, followed by the word ―traffic.‖ 6.8.5.5.2.  Your call sign. 6.8.5.5.3.  Your aircraft type in terms the average VFR pilot will understand. 6.8.5.5.4.  Your location in terms the average VFR pilot will understand. 6.8.5.5.5.  Your intentions. 6.8.5.5.6.  Repeat the name of the airport. 6.8.5.5.6.1.  Example:    ―Shenandoah  traffic,  Track  66,  white  Learjet,  5  miles south on the straight-in ILS Runway 5, touch and go, Shenandoah.‖ 6.9.  Flyability Checks. 6.9.1.  Instrument  procedure  flyability  checks  are  flown  to  ensure  procedures  are  safe, practical,  and  consistent  with  good  operating  procedures  before  general  use.    They  may  be accomplished  in  lieu  of  or  in  addition  to  an  official  flight  check.    Whenever  possible, flyability  checks  should  be  conducted  by  instructor/evaluator  pilots.    Flyability  checks  are NOT  official  flight  inspections  (―flight  checks‖),  but  shall  include  the  entire  procedure including the missed approach segment and all holding patterns.  Prior to accomplishing a   126  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 flyability  check,  pilots  will  review  applicable  portions  of  AFI  11-230,  Instrument Procedures. 6.10.  Procedure and Database Problem Reporting. 6.10.1.  Despite the best quality control measures, it is still possible for aircrews to discover errors  in  databases,  instrument  procedures,  charts,  etc.    If  you  discover  a  discrepancy  or  a discrepancy  between  two  sources  (ex.  procedure  pulled  from  aircraft  database  differs  from paper  IAP), report the discrepancy to  your unit Standardization/Evaluation  function.  They, in turn, should report the details to the source of the database or procedure.  All sources of databases,  instrument  procedures,  charts,  etc.  have  established  procedures  for  reporting errors.  Procedures and points of contact vary by vendor and organization and are located in the documentation that comes with the particular product. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   127  Chapter 7 IFR DEPARTURE PROCEDURES 7.1.  Introduction.  In order to understand how to apply Air Force IFR Departure Procedures, it is  important  to  understand  that  the  guidance  in  AFI  11-202V3  and  this  chapter  is  written  to maximize Air Force global combat capability. Text in this chapter is a compilation of guidance from  previous  versions  of  this  manual,  the  Aeronautical  Information  Manual,  the  FAA Instrument  Procedures  Handbook,  the  FAA  Instrument  Flying  Manual,  AFI  11-230,  and  other sources. For background and other non-procedural information on TERPS criteria and departure planning, see also AFI 11-230, and AFMAN 11-217V3.  For information on VFR departures, see AFMAN 11-217V2. 7.2.  IFR  Departure  Philosophy.  To  maximize  mission  capability,  and  to  preserve  that capability by preventing mishaps, USAF pilots must be able to safely depart any location on the globe,  regardless  of  non-USAF  published  weather  limitations.    All  published  IFR  departure procedures  are  created  using  criteria  that  incorporate  either  a  route  and/or  a  minimum  climb profile to avoid terrain, obstacles, or air traffic lanes.  In determining the minimum climb profile, TERPS uses a ―standard‖ climb  rate of 200 ft/NM, normally beginning at  the departure  end of the  runway  (DER).    If  a  gradient  other  than  standard  is  required  it  will  be  published.    In  civil aviation,  pilots  may  takeoff  in  good  or  marginal  weather  as  long  as  they  can  ―see  and  avoid‖ obstacles and terrain.   USAF pilots departing IFR may not plan to use ―see and avoid‖ in lieu of complying  with  published  or  standard  climb  gradients  since  Air  Force  aircraft  are  issued  their own  weather  minima  in  AFI  11-202V3  and  AFI  11-2MDSV3.  In  addition,  without  comparing the aircraft‘s performance to a TERPS defined standard, there‘s no way of ensuring an obstacle could  be  avoided  even  if  acquired  by  the  pilot  in  visual  conditions.    By  ensuring  the  aircraft‘s climb  performance  meets  or  exceeds  the  published  minimum  climb  gradient,  weather (ceiling/visibility)  is  no  longer  a  limiting  factor  in  AF  operations.    Further,  civil  multi-engine fixed  wing  aircraft  are  certified  as  airworthy  by  demonstrating  a  certain  climb  capability  with one  engine  inoperative  (OEI).    In  response  to  this  requirement,  most  manufacturers  of  USAF aircraft publish engine-out climb performance charts in the aircraft flight manual.  Pilots must be extremely familiar with the performance capability of their aircraft and multi-engine aircraft are normally required to meet climb gradients OEI.  These concepts, along with the basic rules listed in AFI 11-202V3, are the foundation of IFR departure operations for USAF pilots: 7.2.1.  USAF pilots operating under IFR  must comply with applicable IFR climb gradients (or  Special  MAJCOM  Certification  procedure).  Exception:  If  the  mission  justifies  the increased  risk,  and  when  specifically  authorized  by  the  MAJCOM/A3,  USAF  aircraft  may depart any location, in VMC, without regard to the IFR climb gradient. 7.2.2.  USAF  pilots  shall  comply  with  takeoff  weather  minima  IAW  AFI  11-202V3  and AFI  11-2MDSV3.  Pilots  of  USAF  aircraft  will  not  use  FAA  or  civil  takeoff  weather minima  nor  fly  “see  and  avoid”  in  lieu  of  IFR  climb  gradients  unless  specifically authorized  by  the  MAJCOM/A3  or  as  provided  by  AFI  11-202V3.    Information  on  VFR departures may be found in AFMAN11-217V2. 7.2.3.  USAF  pilots  flying  under  IFR will  delay  all  turns  until  at  least  400  feet  above  the DER  elevation  unless  an  early the  departure is  specifically  required  by turn   128  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 procedure.  (Reduced Takeoff Runway Length (RTRL) and non-standard weather minimum procedures may require more than 400‘.) 7.2.4.  USAF pilots will climb at a minimum rate of 200 feet per nautical mile (200 ft/NM) unless  a  higher  gradient the minimum/published climb gradient for the runway used with all engines operating. is  published  and  must  always  meet  or  exceed 7.3.  Planning  an  Instrument  Departure.  For  USAF  pilots,  planning  a  safe  IFR  departure normally  consists  of  three  steps:    selection  of  a  valid  IFR  departure  method,  determining  the minimum required climb gradient, and ensuring aircraft performance meets or exceeds that climb gradient.  This chapter is organized along that process, and a summary decision tree is provided at  the  end  (Figure  7.23.)    It  is  important  to  remember  that  when  TERPS  constructs  an  IFR departure, the obstacle avoidance gradients calculated are absolute, and do not assume a loss of thrust on takeoff.  FAA and USAF multi-engine aircraft certification requirements, however, do assume  a  loss  of  thrust  on  takeoff.    As  a  result,  USAF  multi-engine  aircraft  must  compute obstacle climb gradients assuming the loss of thrust equal to “one engine inoperative” (OEI).  Regardless of the type of aircraft flown, on all IFR departures, the minimum climb gradient for any IFR departure will be the higher of:  200 ft/NM, as directed by the MAJCOM, as directed by a departure procedure, or as directed by the aircraft flight manual.  When mission priority dictates,  in  the  absence  of  more  restrictive  MAJCOM  guidance,  an  operations  supervisor  (or equivalent mission execution authority supervisor) may authorize the pilot to reduce the required TERPS climb gradient by up to 48‘/NM.  (See Subtraction  of 48’/NM from published climb gradient, later in this chapter, for more procedural guidance on reducing the published required climb gradient.)  NOTE:  USAF pilots must ensure their pre-mission planning includes review of IFR departure restrictions to ensure they do not arrive at, or divert to, a location they are unable to legally depart. 7.3.1.  Diverse  Departure  Assessment.  When  an  instrument  approach  is  constructed,  the TERPS  specialist  determines  the  need  for  a  departure  procedure  (DP).    If  no  obstacle  or terrain  penetrates  a  40:1  slope  (termed  the  obstacle  clearance  surface  (OCS)  or  obstacle identification  surface  (OIS))  from  the  departure  end  of  the  runway  (DER),  an  aircraft  may turn in any direction and remain clear of obstacles while climbing at 200‗/NM.  That runway has passed a diverse departure assessment (Figure 7.1) and no obstacle departure procedure (ODP) is required. 7.3.1.1.  If  low,  close-in  obstacles  (published  in  the  ODP  section  of  the  approach  plate book) penetrate the 40:1 OCS, a diverse departure may still be flown but the pilot must comply with the Low close-in obstacles section of this chapter. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   129  Figure 7.1.

The  pilot  must  be  aware  that  beyond  the  diverse  departure obstacle  assessment  area,  there  may  be  significant  obstacles/terrain  that  must  be  avoided.  For  this  reason,  when  planning  ANY  instrument  departure  or  arrival,  pilots  must  check terrain  and  obstacle  information  for  areas  surrounding  the  immediate  terminal  area.   In many  cases,  this  can  be  done  by  checking  the  MSA/ESA  from  the  IAP  or  asking  the  radar controller  the  height  of  the  minimum  vectoring  altitude  (MVA)  for  the  area  of  concern (beyond  the  25  NM,  non-mountainous  and  46  NM  mountainous  diverse  departure  obstacle assessment area).  In other cases, such as non-radar environments, a thorough study of terrain charts, nearby airport IAPs, or IFR enroute charts may provide the pilot with this data in the form  of  MSAs,  ESAs,  MCAs,  MEAs,  MOCAs,  etc.    Regardless  of  the  departure/arrival method chosen, pilots must be aware of their surroundings, especially in terminal areas. 7.3.3.  Runway  End  Crossing  Height.  Runway  End  Crossing  Height  or  Screen  Height  is the aircraft‘s required AGL altitude at the Departure End of the Runway (DER).  The OCS slope begins at the DER at the runway end crossing height.  Determining and complying with the  proper  runway  end  crossing  height  is  crucial  to  preventing  unsafe  operations  below  the OCS.  Runway end crossing heights vary depending on location of the airport, who designed the procedure, terrain, obstacles, etc.  The parenthetical notation at the top of DoD approach plates  cannot  reliably  be  used  to  determine  what  rules  were  used  to  produce  a  departure procedure  and  screen  heights  are  not  consistently  published  in  the  ODP  section  of  the approach  plates.    USAF  pilots  will  only  consider  the  type  of  airfield  when  determining runway  end  crossing  height:        USAF/USN  non-joint-use  and  all  others  (Civil/Joint Use/ICAO/NATO/etc.)    Consult the IFR Supplement or other appropriate FLIP for this information.  Joint use airfields will be annotated as ―MIL/CIV‖ (Figure 7.2).  If an airport is listed as an AFB or NAS and does not include ―MIL/CIV‖ in the listing, then it is non-joint-use. Figure 7.2.  Joint Use Designation From IFR Supplement.    130  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 7.3.3.1.  USAF/USN non-joint-use bases.  The OCS at USAF and USN bases normally begins at  zero feet  AGL at  the DER, but  the OCS may  be  raised as much as 35 feet  in order to clear obstacles.  If the TERPS specialist raises the OCS, it will be published in the  ODP  (Figure  7.3.)    At  non-joint-use  USAF  or  USN  bases,  assume  a  zero  foot runway end crossing height unless a higher altitude is published. Figure 7.3.  Specific Runway End Crossing Height.  7.3.3.2.  Other  than  USAF/USN  non-joint-use  bases  (Civil/ICAO/NATO/etc.  )    If civil aircraft certification standards mandate, or obstacles penetrate the OCS, TERPS may raise the runway end crossing height up to 35 feet to maintain a normal 200‘/NM climb gradient.    There  is  no  reliable  way,  from  looking  at  the  DoD/NACO  FLIP,  to  know  if TERPS raised the OCS or not.  Therefore, for any departure at other than non-joint-use USAF or USN bases, if the screen height is not published in the ODP or other reliable source, pilots will plan to cross the DER at or above 35 feet. 7.3.3.2.1.  There is no provision for a runway end crossing height greater than 35 feet.  If a runway end crossing height of 35 feet does not eliminate all penetrations of the 40:1  OCS,  then  a  higher  than  standard  (i.e.  >200  ft/NM)  climb  gradient  will  be published on the departure. 7.3.3.2.2.  If in doubt, or the 35 foot restriction limits mission capability, contact the appropriate TERPS authority for the airfield.   If further help is  required, contact the USAF Instrument Procedures Center at DSN 339-8300  Comm. (405) 739-8300. 7.3.4.  Obstacle  Clearance  Surface.  When  the  diverse  departure  obstacle  assessment identifies any obstacle that penetrates the 40:1 OCS, the TERPS specialist must construct an ODP to allow safe aircraft departure.  The 40:1 slope used by the TERPS specialist equates to a 152‘/NM gradient.  During the assessment, the TERPS specialist is required to provide a minimum  of  48‘/NM  or  24%  obstacle  clearance  (Required  Obstacle  Clearance  or  ROC)  to obtain the normal minimum climb gradient of 200‘/NM.  If obstacles penetrate the 152‘/NM OCS,  then  the  TERPS  specialist  should  publish  information  so  the  pilot  can  make  a  safe takeoff and  avoid  obstacles and terrain.   This  information  is  normally  found in  the front of the  IAP  book  in  the  section  titled  ―IFR  Takeoff  Minima  and  (Obstacle)  Departure Procedures.‖      For  airports  outside  the  US,  the  separate  listing  will  be  titled  ―IFR  Takeoff Minima  and  Departure  Procedures‖  in  the  DoD/NACO  FLIP.    Commercial  or  foreign government products may differ in title and format.  For example, Jeppesen charts do not use the ―Trouble T‖ symbol.  Instead, they publish IFR takeoff minima and departure procedures on the back of the airfield diagram page.  USAF pilots must become familiar with, and refer to  the  appropriate    of  available  instrument  procedures,  in  order  to  properly  plan  IFR departure procedures. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   131  7.3.5.  Low close-in obstacles (Figure 7.4) are those that would generate an excessive climb gradient  (>200  ft/NM)  that  terminates  at  or  below  200  feet  above  the  departure  end  of  the runway.    Instead  of  publishing  a  steep  climb  gradient  or  complicated  routing,  the  TERPS specialist  will  publish  the  height  and  location  of  the  obstacles  (this  information  can  also appear  in  NOTAMS).  Low  close-in  obstacles  must  be  accounted  for  no  matter  what  IFR departure method a pilot chooses. Pilots will calculate their aircraft performance to ensure they can vertically clear applicable low close-in obstacles on all departures.  One technique for  determining  what  obstacles  are  applicable  might  be  to  consider  all  within  500  feet, laterally,  of  the  planned  departure  (or  emergency  return)  ground  track.        Additionally,  in order  to  ensure  vertical  clearance  of  those  obstacles  (valid  only  for  low-close  in  takeoff obstacles)  compare  the  aircraft‘s  calculated  height  at  the  obstacle‘s  distance  from  liftoff  to the height of the offending obstacle.  Pilots may conclude after careful analysis of low close-in  obstacles  that  a  safe  IFR  departure  cannot  be  made.    In  this  case,  select  an  alternate departure runway or ground track, or consult your MAJCOM for guidance. Figure 7.4.  Low Close-in Obstacles. AMARILLO, TX RICK HUSBAND AMARILLO INTL DEPARTURE PROCEDURE: Rwy 22, climb heading 218° to 4100 before turning northbound. Rwy 31, climbing right turn heading 360° to 5400 before turning westbound. NOTE: Rwy 31, sign 23' from departure end of runway, 257' right of centerline, 6' AGL/3605' MSL.   7.4.  IFR  Departure  Procedures  (DP).  There  are  two  types  of  DPs:  Obstacle  Departure Procedures  (ODP),  printed  either  textually  or  graphically,  and  Standard  Instrument  Departures (SID),  always  printed  graphically.    In  many  cases,  there  is  more  than  one  departure  procedure applicable to a given runway.  If the pilot  does not  know in advance which procedure will be assigned  by  ATC,  he  or  she  must  plan  for  the  highest  climb  gradient  for  the  runway  of intended  departure.    All  DPs,  either  textual  or  graphic  may  be  designed  using  either conventional  or  RNAV  criteria.    RNAV  procedures  will  have  RNAV  printed  in  the  title,  e.g., SHEAD TWO DEPARTURE (RNAV).  The following sections define the valid  IFR departure procedures listed in AFI 11-202V3. 7.4.1.  Obstacle  Departure  Procedures  (ODP).    ODPs  include  routings,  Low  Close-in Obstacles,  Visual  Climb  Over  the  Airport  (VCOA),  Reduced  Takeoff  Runway  Length (RTRL) procedures and Sector Departures.  If TERPS determines that, for a specific runway, a  climb  gradient  greater  than  200‘/NM  is  required  to  clear  obstacles,  the  pilot  must  be notified and provided a safe obstacle departure procedure.  This provision may take the form of listing low close-in obstacles, or the publishing of: non-standard takeoff weather minima, minimum  climb  gradients,  specific  routing,  or  some  combination  of  these  criteria.    Pilots must  comply  with  ODPs  prior  to  commencing  a  SID  or  radar  vector  departure  unless different  procedures  and  minima  are  specified  on  the  SID  or  issued  with  the  departure clearance.    When  departing  an  airport  and  pilot  compliance  with  the  ODP  is  necessary  for traffic  separation,  ATC  must  include  the  ODP  in  your  ATC  clearance.    Example:    ―Depart via the Vandenberg Runway 32 Departure Procedure.‖   132  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 7.4.1.1.  ODP  Notification.    On  U.S.  Government  produced  instrument  procedures,  the pilot  is  notified that runway specific departure information  exists by the placement of a special symbol on all of the IAPs and SIDs for the airport.  (Figure 7.5.)  The symbol is a white  ―T‖  on  a  black  inverted  triangle  ( ),  referred  to  by  some  as  the  ―Trouble  T‖ because  it  indicates  potential  trouble  for  departing  aircraft.  This  ―Trouble  T‖  should  be published  in  the  upper  left  corner  of  Volpe-format  approach  plates,  but  may  be  printed elsewhere on the IAP—for this reason, pilots should carefully check for the ―Trouble T‖ on every instrument procedure for that airfield.   The presence of the ―Trouble T‖ means IFR specific airports/runways. USAF pilots will comply with applicable departure procedures. takeoff  minima  and  departure  procedures  are  prescribed for Figure 7.5.  “Trouble T”.  7.4.1.1.1.  Non-Standard  Takeoff  Weather  Minima.  (Figure 7.6.) When obstacles penetrate  the  40:1  OCS,  non-standard  takeoff  weather  minima  are  provided  for commercial  civil  pilots  to  ―see-and-avoid‖  obstacles  during  departure.  Unless specifically  authorized  by  the  MAJCOM/A3,  USAF  aircraft  are  not  authorized  to flight  plan  using  “see  and  avoid”  operations  in  lieu  of  meeting  standard  or published  climb  gradients.    USAF  pilots  may  only  use  non-standard  weather minima  for  takeoff  if  aircraft  performance  (if  multi-engine,  OEI)  will  allow  the aircraft  to  climb to  the non-standard  ceiling requirement  by the DER and comply with  published  (or  standard  if  none  published)  climb  gradient  requirements thereafter  to  an  appropriate  IFR  altitude.    In  the  example  in  Figure  7.6.,  the  pilot must  climb  to  500‘  AGL  by  the  DER  in  order  to  takeoff  under  IFR  from  either Runway at Orangeburg.  For situational awareness purposes, the visibility portion of the non-standard weather minima provides a clue to the proximity of the obstacle(s).  The lower the required visibility, the closer the obstacle(s). Figure 7.6.  Non-Standard Weather Minima. ORANGEBURG, SC   ORANGEBURG MUNI     TAKE-OFF MINIMUMS: Rwys 5, 31  500-1  7.4.1.1.2.  Aircraft Category.  Occasionally, a departure procedure will be published that  is  specific  to  a  certain  category  of  aircraft.    (Figure  7.7.)    On  procedures  that specify  an  aircraft  category,  use  the  aircraft  approach  category  from  the  aircraft flight manual or AFI 11-2MDSV3 to determine which procedure(s) to apply. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   133  Figure 7.7.  ODP Specific to Aircraft Category.  7.4.1.1.3.  Minimum  Climb  Gradient.  (Figure  7.8.)  TERPS  may  provide  a minimum  climb  gradient  with  or  without  takeoff  weather  minima.    Some  non-standard takeoff weather minima may have an asterisk (*) referring to a note that lists a  specific  climb  gradient  that  may  be  used  with  standard  weather  minima.    When using  this  type  of  IFR  departure,  USAF  pilots  will  substitute  MAJCOM-directed takeoff weather minima in place of the word “standard.” Figure 7.8.  Minimum Climb Gradient In Lieu of Non-Standard Weather Minima. SIMMONS AAF (KFBG)   FORT BRAGG, NC  …………Rwy 27, 900-1* *Standard with minimum climb of 250/NM to 1000’.   7.4.1.1.3.1.  Occasionally, the terrain or obstacles surrounding an airport are such that  the  TERPS  specialist  has  no  choice  but  to  restrict  departures  to  weather suitable  for  see-and-avoid  operations.    In  Figure  7.9.  below,  notice  that  BOTH  non-standard weather minima AND a minimum climb gradient are specified.  In this  example, to  depart  IFR  from  Runway  7  at  Eagle  County  Regional,  a  USAF pilot  must  be  able  to  (if  multi-engine,  OEI)  either:    climb  to  5100‘  AGL  by  the departure  end  of  the  runway  in  any  weather  down  to  MAJCOM  minima,  and continue  the  climb  at  200‘/NM  thereafter,  OR  climb  to  700‘  AGL  by  the departure end of the runway, then climb at 480‗/NM to 11,800 MSL, then climb at 200‘/NM thereafter.   134  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 Figure 7.9.  Non-Standard takeoff minima AND a required climb gradient:  7.4.1.1.4.  Specific  Routing.  (Figure  7.10.)  Another  ODP  method  used  by  TERPS provides a specific route of flight.  You must be careful when using this type of IFR departure as a requirement may exist to use non-standard takeoff weather minima in order to execute the procedure.  This situation could indicate more than one obstacle along the departure path and would not be allowed unless you comply with paragraph 7.4.1.1.3.1.    Pilots  must  comply  with  the  assigned  routing  to  be  assured  of  obstacle clearance during a Specific Routing departure. Figure 7.10.  ODP with specific routing. ROANOKE, VA   ROANOKE REGIONAL/WOODRUM FIELD TAKE-OFF MINIMUMS: Rwys 6, 33  NA-obstacles.

In  Figure  7.11.  the  TERPS  specialist  used  a combination of the above methods to delineate a safe departure.  In this example, the pilot must comply with each requirement: the routing dictated by the procedure along with any required climb gradient. Figure 7.11.  Combination of Methods. RICHMOND, VA   CHESTERFIELD COUNTY TAKE-OFF MINIMUMS: Rwy 15, 800-1 or std. with a min. climb of 280’ per NM to 1200’.  Rwy 33, 1200-1, or std. with min. climb of 220’ per NM to 1700. DEPARTURE PROCEDURE: Rwy 15, climb runway heading to 1200’ before proceeding on course.  Rwy 33, climb runway heading to 1700’ before proceeding on course.  7.4.1.2.  Visual  Climb  Over  the  Airport  (VCOA)  is  an  ODP  that  requires  a  climb  in visual  conditions  over  the  airfield  or  an  on-airport  NAVAID  to  an  altitude  where  the aircraft  enters  the  standard  obstacle  protection  area  of  the  ODP.  (VCOAs  may  also  be termed  as  Visual  Climb  to  Instrument  Departure  and  abbreviated  as  either  VCTID  or AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   135  VCID.) The standard 200‘/NM climb gradient applies while flying the VCOA as do low close-in  obstacles,  if  listed.    While  this  departure  is  an  authorized  ODP,  USAF  pilots must  complete  MAJCOM-  developed,  MDS-specific  training  before  flying  VCOA departures.    Except  for  MAJCOM-  approved  NVD  trained  and  equipped  aircrew, USAF pilots will not fly VCOA procedures at night. 7.4.1.2.1.  VCOAs  are  developed  when  obstacles  that  are  more  than  3  SM  from  the DER require a climb gradient in excess of 200‘/NM.  A VCOA procedure is indicated by  the  words  ―climb  in  visual  conditions‖  directly  associated  with  a  ceiling  and visibility  in  the  TAKEOFF  MINIMA  section  of  the  ODP  and  either  by  a  specific VCOA  listing  or  ―climb  in  visual  conditions‖  in  the  DEPARTURE  PROCEDURE section of the ODP.  NOTE:  There are procedures that include the verbiage ―climb in visual  conditions‖  that  do  not  include  a  ceiling  and  visibility.    These  are  not considered VCOA procedures. 7.4.1.2.2.  To properly execute a VCOA, in  the absence of more specific MAJCOM guidance,  climb  at  a  minimum  of  200’/NM,  visually  avoid  obstacles  and  terrain, remain  within  the  published  distance  (or  published  visibility  substituted  for distance) from the geographic center of the airfield and climb above the published ceiling.  Continue  to  climb  to  the  IFR  enroute  altitude  at  a  minimum  of  200’/NM after the VCOA procedure.   If the VCOA does not also include departure procedure instructions  at  the  climb-to  altitude,  the  aircraft  can  safely  proceed  on  course  while maintaining  a  standard  climb  gradient  to  the  IFR  enroute  altitude.    USAF  pilots  are prohibited from constructing their own VCOA by using circling approach minima or applying circling approach obstacle clearance standards to a VCOA. 7.4.1.2.2.1.  In  the  example  below  (Figure  7.12.),  a  pilot  departing  from  runway 19 must remain within 3 SM of the center of Stevens Field and visually avoiding any obstacles while climbing to 1900‘ AGL, then turn southbound over the field continuing  the  climb  to  9400‘  MSL  at  200‘/NM,  then  via  the  DRO  066°  radial towards DRO VOR/DME.  Obviously, this is a complex maneuver that requires a thorough  study  of  the  airfield  and  surroundings  as  well  as  significant  pre-departure  planning  for  safe  accomplishment.  It  is  also  worth  noting  that  some obstacles may be inside the visibility radius and, due to the nature of ―prevailing visibility,‖  may  not  be  continuously  visible  during  the  maneuver.    Pilots  must maintain  constant  situational  awareness  throughout  the  maneuver  to  preclude  an unsafe position in relation to any obstacles within the VCOA maneuver area. Figure 7.12.  Visual Climb Over the Airport (VCOA) Procedure.    136  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 7.4.1.2.3.  TERPS  specialists  construct  VCOAs  assuming  an  airspeed  of  250  KIAS and a bank angle of 23 degrees unless a different airspeed is published.  A bank angle of 30 degrees is recommended to remain within the published visibility radius.  The geographic  center  of  the  airfield  is  not  a  precisely  defined  point  on  any  published diagram and must be estimated based on the layout of the runways.  It is important to remember  that  USAF  pilots  must  not  exceed  the  published  distance  (or  visibility requirement  substituted  as  a  distance)  until  above  the  altitude  specified  in  the procedure.  Aircraft  turn  radius  at  climbout  speed,  or  aircraft  flight  manual  takeoff procedures, may render this procedure unusable. 7.4.1.2.4.  Pilots must be aware that while the VCOA may require a certain prevailing visibility  in  order  to  fly  the  procedure,  this  only  accounts  for  half  of  the  visibility around  the  airfield.    There  is  no  guarantee  that  the  visibility  in  the  area  of  the controlling obstacle will be great enough to see the obstacle.  Thorough pre-departure planning and MAJCOM training are critical to safe VCOA operations. 7.4.1.2.5.  The VCOA climb area is not necessarily devoid of obstacles.  The pilot is still  responsible  for  visually  acquiring  and  avoiding  obstacles  while  executing  the VCOA procedure. 7.4.1.3.  Reduced  Takeoff  Runway  Length  Procedure.  This  procedure  was  formerly known as ―limiting takeoff runway available‖ (TORA). The TERPS specialist may find that by artificially limiting the takeoff length of the runway, a normal climb gradient may avoid obstacles that penetrate an OCS that begins at the DER (Figure 7.13.) USAF pilots shall  only  use  an  RTRL  procedure  if  it  is  published  as  an  ODP  in  FLIP.    An  RTRL procedure  produces  a  zero  screen  height  and  therefore  a  lower  climb  gradient  by requiring  the  aircraft  to  lift  off  the  runway  at  or  prior  to  a  specified  distance  from  the DER.  Pilots must check takeoff and landing data (TOLD) carefully when planning this type of departure.  In the example below, subtract the value in the RTRL procedure from the  usable  runway  length  to  determine  the  ―reduced  runway  length.‖    Compare  your aircraft‘s  ―takeoff  ground  run‖  or  ―takeoff  distance‖  value  to  the  new  reduced  runway length.  If the reduced length is equal to or greater than your aircraft‘s calculated ―ground run‖, the procedure may be flown using a standard climb gradient of 200‘/NM.  Since the TERPS  specialist  has  access  to  much  more  obstacle  and  terrain  data  than  a  pilot,  and because  adjusting  the  lift-off  point  may  produce  a  new  controlling  obstacle  (Figure 7.14.),  USAF pilots are prohibited from creating their own RTRL procedure. Figure 7.13.  RTRL Procedure. HOBBS, NM   LEA COUNTY RGNL TAKE-OFF MINIMUMS: Rwy 8, std. w/ a min. climb of 218’ per NM to 4300’, or alternatively, with standard takeoff minimums and a normal 200’ per NM climb gradient, takeoff must occur no later than 1600’ prior to the departure end of the runway.  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   137  Figure 7.14.  RTRL Changing Controlling Obstacle. 7.4.2.  Sector  Departures.  (Figure  7.15)    Published  ―sector‖  diverse  departures  (i.e. ―Diverse  Departure  authorized  145°  CW  to  278°  with  min  climb  gradient  of…)  are authorized  as  an  ODP.    Pilots  must  ensure  that  they  can  meet  or  exceed  any  published climb gradient for the departure to be flown.  Figure 7.15.  Sector Diverse Departure.  7.4.3.  Standard  Instrument  Departure  (SID).  A SID is a departure procedure in  graphic and/or textual form established at certain airports to simplify clearance delivery procedures, and assist in meeting environmental, capacity, and air traffic control requirements. SIDs may be requested by specific ATC facilities, the military services, or other proponents to enhance operations.  SIDs  also  provide  protection  from  obstacles  and  are  depicted  graphically; however, they will not contain the "(OBSTACLE)" designation following the procedure title on  the  chart,  and  may  not  be  flown  unless  approved  by  ATC.    A  heavy  black  line  on  the graphic  version  depicts  the  SID;  thin  black  lines  on  the  graphic  version  show  transition routings.    The  departure  route  description  should  be  complete  enough  that  the  pilot  can  fly the SID without the graphic depiction.  If a higher than standard climb gradient is required, it will be published on the SID. 7.4.3.1.  At locations where SIDs exist, expect an ATC clearance containing a SID.    If unable to  utilize a SID for departure, inform  ATC by putting ―NO SID‖  in  the remarks section of the flight plan or as soon as possible by direct communication. 7.4.3.2.  SIDs  constructed  by  either  military  or  civilian  specialists  are  designed  using either  conventional  or  RNAV  criteria.    Though  both  military  and  civil  SIDs  are constructed  using  very  similar  rules,  there  are  some  minor  differences  in  how  they   138  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 display  information  to  the  pilot.    Both  civil  and  military  SIDs  may  include  crossing restrictions necessary for ATC and/or obstacle clearance but  the reason for the crossing restriction, whether for ATC or obstacles, will not be published.  Additionally, SIDs are published in two formats.  In the USAF these are termed pilot navigation SIDs and vector SIDs. 7.4.3.2.1.  Military  SIDS  are  USAF/USN  SIDs  in  the  CONUS.        Military  SIDs provide  climb  rate  information  in  a  slightly  different  way  than  civil  SIDS.    Both,  if required,  will  provide  a  table  of  higher  than  standard  climb  rates  on  the  graphic depiction.  Obstacle clearance climb rates will be denoted with an asterisk (*) while ATC climb rates will be denoted with a dagger (†).    Military SIDs will have some obstacles charted to scale, where civil SIDs will not. 7.4.3.2.2.  Civil  SIDs  do  not  depict  obstacles  graphically  but  list  low,  close-in obstacles  textually.    Obstacle  climb  gradients  may  be  published  directly  on  the  SID or, in the case of a , in the ODP procedure.  Civil SID climb rate tables are either due to obstacles or will be labeled ―ATC Climb Rate.‖  Army SIDs are produced by the FAA in the CONUS and should be treated as civil SIDs. 7.4.3.2.3.  Pilot Navigation (NAV) SIDs.  (Figure 7.16)  The pilot is responsible for following the SID routing.  These SIDs are established for airports when terrain and safety related factors indicate the necessity  for a  Pilot  NAV SID.  Some  Pilot  NAV SIDs may contain vector instructions which pilots are expected to comply with until instructed to resume normal navigation on the filed/assigned route or SID procedure.  Pilot  NAV  SIDs  normally  have  a  graphic  depiction  of  the  departure  routing  (thick black lines) followed by transition routing (thin black lines).  Multiple routings from multiple runways may be depicted on the same SID. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   139  Figure 7.16.  Pilot-Nav SID.  7.4.3.2.4.  Vector SIDs.  (Figure 7.17)  Vector SIDs are established where ATC will provide radar navigational  guidance to  a  filed/assigned  route or to  a  fix depicted on the  SID.    Typically,  a  vector  SID  will  depict  only  area  navaids  or  fixes  with  some simple  textual  departure  instructions.    As  on  all  SIDs,  pilots  will  comply  with    the ODP,  if  published  for  that  runway,  prior  to  accepting  radar  vectors,  unless otherwise directed by ATC.   140  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 Figure 7.17.  Vector SID.  7.4.3.3.  Climb  Rate  Chart  Usage.  The  climb  rates  published  on  military  SIDs  give vertical velocities for given groundspeeds.  The easiest way to use this information is to look at the 60 knot column.  Using the 60 to 1 rule, 60 knots is 1 NM/min so the vertical velocity for this speed provides the required obstacle climb gradient in ft/NM.  (If there is no 60 knot block, simply divide the 120 knot block by 2, the 180 knot block by 3, etc.)   (Tech order climb profiles still apply.) 7.4.3.4.  How to Fly a SID.  If an airfield has a published SID for the expected departure runway, pilots may file the SID IAW FLIP GP.  Review SIDs for textual instructions that give  precise  guidance  on  how  to  interpret  and  fly  the  graphic  version  of  the  SID  (if included). 7.4.3.4.1.  SID  Altitudes/Climb  Gradients.  In  your  initial  clearance,  ATC  will normally assign an altitude to climb and maintain.  In some cases, your initial altitude AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   141  will be published on the SID.  In others, the altitude issued with  your IFR clearance may be higher than restriction(s) on the SID.  In all cases, you must comply with the SID restrictions.  While flying a SID, if published, use the SID climb gradient.  The memory aid ―SID‘s stand alone‖ may assist in remembering which climb gradient to apply.    (It  is  still  critical,  however,  to  reference  the  ODP  when  a appears  on  the approach plate as it may apply prior to joining the SID routing.)   Pilots  must  notify ATC immediately if they cannot meet the published climb gradient or, if one is not published, a minimum of 200 ft/nm on each segment of the SID up to the MEA.  If you  are  radar  vectored  or  cleared  off  an  assigned  SID,  you  may  consider  the  SID cancelled unless the controller adds ―Expect  to  resume SID.‖   If ATC reinstates the SID and wishes any restrictions associated with the SID to still apply, the controller will state: ―Comply with restrictions.‖ 7.4.3.4.2.  Amended Clearances.  ATC may amend your clearance at any time.  It is important to remember that the most recent ATC clearance takes precedence over all others.    When  the  route or  altitude  in  a  previously  issued  clearance  is  amended,  the controller  will  restate  applicable  altitude  restrictions.    In  the  United  States  if  the altitude  to  maintain  is  changed  or  restated,  whether  prior  to  departure  or  while airborne,  and  previously  issued  altitude  restrictions  are  omitted,  those  altitude restrictions  are  canceled,  including  SID/DP/STAR  altitude  restrictions.    Pilots  must ensure minimum climb gradients for obstacle clearance are still met. 7.4.3.5.  Equipment  Requirements.  DPs  (SIDs  and  ODPs)  are  further  delineated  by equipment requirements as follows: 7.4.3.5.1.  Non-RNAV DP.  A DP established for aircraft equipped with conventional avionics  using  ground-based  NAVAIDs;  e.g.,  non-directional  beacon  (NDB),  very high  frequency  omni-directional  range  (VOR),  VHF  omni-directional  range/tactical air  navigation  (VORTAC),  localizer  (LOC),  etc.    These  DPs  may  also  be  designed using dead reckoning navigation. 7.4.3.5.2.  RNAV  DP.  A DP established for aircraft equipped with RNAV avionics; e.g., global positioning system (GPS), FMS, etc.  Automated vertical navigation must not be required.  All RNAV procedures not requiring GPS must be annotated with the note: ―RADAR REQUIRED.‖ 7.4.3.5.3.  Radar  DP.  Radar  may  be  used  for  navigation  guidance  for  SID  design.  Radar SIDs are established when ATC has a need to vector aircraft on departure to a particular  ATS  Route,  NAVAID,  or  Fix.    Radar  vectors  may  also  be  used  to  join conventional  or  RNAV  navigation  SIDs.    SIDs  requiring  radar  vectors  must  be annotated ―RADAR REQUIRED.‖ 7.4.4.  Specific ATC Departure Instructions.  Specific ATC departure instructions include a heading and an altitude.  Though a controller assumes shared responsibility for terrain and obstacle  clearance  once  he  or  she  begins  to  provide  navigational  guidance,  ultimate responsibility always rests with the pilot.  When told to “fly runway heading,” do not apply wind drift corrections. 7.4.4.1.  If  the  departure  instructions  do  not  contain  a  climb  gradient  and  there  are  no published gradients for the runway utilized for departure, pilots are required to maintain   142  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 200 ft/NM.  Controllers are required to issue climb gradients in excess of 200ft/NM with the departure instructions.  If terrain  or obstacles in  the direction of departure appear to require  a  higher  than  standard  climb  gradient  or  if  your  specific  departure  instructions conflict with information published in an ODP, query the controller.  Except in a Diverse Vector Area (DVA), USAF pilots must fly the ODP prior to the departure instructions.  However, as a pilot there is nothing to inform you that you are in a DVA.  Therefore, if the  airport  has  a  ―Trouble  T‖  and  the  departure  instructions  seem  to  conflict  with  the ODP  or  there  is  any  question  about  which  procedure  to  fly,  query  the  controller  for clarification. 7.4.4.2.  Definition  of  DVA:  That  area,  in  a  radar  environment,  in  which  a  prescribed departure route is not required to avoid obstacles, and radar vectors may be issued below the  minimum  vectoring  altitude/minimum  IFR  altitude  (established  in  accordance  with the  TERPS  criteria  for  diverse  departures,  obstacles  and  terrain  avoidance)  to  departing aircraft.    When  a  DVA  is  developed,  the  standard  climb  gradient  required  is  200‘/NM.  ATC  controllers  in  the  US  are  required  to  issue  the  climb  gradient  for  the  DVA  in  the IFR clearance to the aircrew if it is greater than 200‘ /NM. 7.4.5.  Diverse Departures (ICAO:  Omni-Directional Departures).  If no obstacles (other than  low,  close-in  obstacles)  penetrate  the  40:1  Obstacle  Clearance  Surface  (OCS)  for  a particular  runway,  then  a  minimum  climb  gradient  of  200‘/NM  will  ensure  proper  obstacle clearance.  If a runway does not have a published DP and does not have an ODP in the IFR Takeoff Minimums and Departure  Procedures section of FLIP specifically stating, ―Diverse Departure  Not  Authorized‖  (Figure  7.19.),  then  a  diverse  departure  is  an  acceptable  IFR departure  procedure  for  that  runway  (Figure  7.18.)    A  diverse  departure  allows  the  pilot  to execute a turn in any direction from the runway and remain clear of obstacles.  There is no special way to file a diverse departure; simply list a fix or NAVAID as the first point on the route  of  flight  IAW  FLIP  GP.    To  fly  a  diverse  departure,  fly  the  extended  runway centerline  ground  track  until  400  feet  above  DER  elevation  before  executing  any  turns.  Maintain a minimum climb gradient of 200’/NM until reaching a minimum IFR altitude. Figure 7.18.  Diverse Departure Authorized (for Runway 10 ONLY!). HUNTER AAF (KSVN)  SAVANNAH, GA   *Or standard with minimum climb of 340 per NM ………Rwy 28, 300-1*  to 400.  Rwy 28, climbing left turn hdg 230° to 1700 before proceeding on course.  7.4.5.1.  ATC will not specifically clear you for a diverse departure.  Do not mistake the words ―cleared as filed‖ as clearance for a diverse departure.  This is only the case if the required  climb  gradient  is  200‘/NM  or  less  and  there  is  no  ODP  published  for  the departure runway.    If there is  an ODP for the departure runway, USAF pilots  will  fly the ODP before beginning the “cleared as filed” portion of the departure. 7.4.5.2.  There  are  airports  around  the  world  where  a  diverse  departure  obstacle assessment  has  not  been  performed  or  completed  to  US  TERPS  standards.    At  these airports, a diverse departure may not be authorized for certain runways.  The pilot should AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   143  be notified via NOTAM, or in the case of DoD/NACO FLIP books, by a statement in the front of the book under the section titled, ―IFR Takeoff Minima and (Obstacle) Departure Procedures.‖    The  statement  will  say,  ―Diverse  Departure  Not  Authorized.‖    (Figure 7.19.)  Commercial or foreign government products may not follow this convention. Figure 7.19.  Diverse Departure Not Authorized. OCEANA NAS (KNTU) VIRGINIA BEACH, VA      Diverse Departure not Authorized.  7.4.5.3.  When  a  diverse  departure  is  not  authorized,  it indicates  penetration  of  the  40:1 OCS and there should be at least one SID or IFR Departure Procedure published for that airport.    However,  this  is  not  always  true  in  DoD  FLIP.    There  are  cases  where  a commercial or host nation procedure will contain a climb gradient not annotated in DoD FLIP.    Consequently,  where  diverse  departures  are  not  authorized,  absence  of  a  SID  or IFR  Departure  Procedures  does  NOT  indicate  a  radar  departure  with  a  200‘/NM  climb gradient is appropriate.  Therefore, if there is no SID or IFR Departure Procedure AND diverse  departures  are  NOT  authorized,  coordination  with  MAJCOM  TERPS specialists  is  required  to  determine  the  best  departure  method  and  required  climb gradient  prior  to  an  IFR  departure.    MAJCOM  TERPS  will  assist  in  coordinating  a solution with the agency responsible for the airfield‘s airspace. 7.4.6.  Special  MAJCOM  Certification.  At  specific  airfields,  MAJCOMs  may  develop their  own  takeoff  procedures  for  use  by  specific  aircraft  and  MAJCOM-trained  and/or certified  aircrews  under  specific  conditions.    Since  these  special  certifications  by  definition do  not  provide  an  equivalent  level  of  safety  as  conventional  departure  procedures,  their construction and use must be validated with an Operational Risk Management assessment to operate from that airfield under those conditions.  Once developed, MAJCOMs will provide a  copy  to  HQ  AFFSA  A3OF  for  review.    HQ  AFFSA  A3OF  will  keep  a  copy  of  the procedure on file for reference. 7.5.  Reducing  Required  Climb  Gradients.  As previously covered, USAF  aircraft must meet or  exceed  published  climb  gradients.    If  multi-engine,  fixed-wing  aircraft  must  calculate  this climb  performance  assuming  a  loss  of  thrust  equal  to  ―one  engine  inoperative‖  (OEI)  in accordance with the aircraft‘s certification requirements.  Mission tasking authorities and pilots will  plan  missions  so  that  their  aircraft  always  meet  or  exceed  published  IFR  climb restrictions.  However, there are instances (e.g. contingency, humanitarian relief, etc.) when the mission  dictates  an  aircraft  depart  a  location  with  less  than  the  required/published  OEI  climb performance.  In  these  cases,  the  only  other  option  may  be  to  use  a  pre-planned  OEI  ―escape‖ route  or  reduce  the  required  climb  gradient.    WARNING:  It  is  important  to  remember  that  in such  an  instance,  if  the  aircraft  experiences  a  loss  of  thrust,  no  safety  margin  exists  and  the aircraft will almost certainly impact terrain and/or obstacles, especially if the departure is flown at  night  or  in  IMC.  While  this  is  always  true  for  single-engine  aircraft,  aircraft  certification requirements normally mitigate this risk for multi-engine aircraft.  Use of any method to reduce the  required  climb  gradient  eliminates  the  safety  factors  designed  into  the  TERPS  departure procedure and the aircraft‘s airworthiness certification.  When using any method to reduce the required  climb  gradient,  the  PIC  must  still  ensure  the  aircraft,  with  all  engines  operating   144  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 (AEO), meets or exceeds the published climb gradient and all ATC or SID climb restrictions for the method selected. 7.5.1.  Methods to  reduce  required  climb  gradients.  Delaying  a  mission  until environmental  conditions  (temperature,  pressure  altitude,  winds,  etc.)  or  mission requirements (fuel load required, stores, cargo load, etc.) allow compliance with the required climb  gradient  is  the  safest  option.    IAW  AFI  11-202V3,  operations  supervisors    (or equivalent  mission  execution  authority  supervisor)  may  reduce  the  required  climb  gradient by the ROC safety margin.  Another method to reduce the required IFR climb gradient is to use a special emergency-use-only procedure termed ―Special Departure Procedure‖ (SDP). 7.5.1.1.  Subtraction of 48’/NM from published climb gradient.  (Requires operations supervisor or equivalent  mission execution authority supervisor approval.) If there is no SDP  for  the  departure  runway,  the  only  other  approved  method  to  reduce  the  required climb  gradient  is  to  subtract  48‘/NM  from  the  published  minimum  climb  gradient.    In Figure 7.20. the resultant climb gradient the pilot must comply with is 322‘/NM to 1700‘ MSL (370 – 48 = 322). Figure 7.20.  Subtracting 48’/NM. HUTCHINSON, KS HUTCHINSON MUNI TAKE-OFF MINIMUMS: Rwys 4, 22, 300-1 or std. with a min. climb of 370’ per NM to 1700’. DEPARTURE PROCEDURE: All Rwys, eastbound departures (030° CW 130°) climb runway heading to 3300’ before turning.  7.5.1.2.  Special  Departure  Procedure  (SDP)  (Figure  7.22.)    SDPs  are  MDS-specific, commercially  designed  and  published  procedures,  that  require  MAJCOM  training  and certification  before  use.  SDPs  are  especially  useful  for  multi-engine  aircraft,  as  the procedure  often  increases  the  allowable  takeoff  gross  weight  while  simultaneously providing  the  pilot  an  ―escape‖  routing  he  or  she  can  use  in  the  event  the  aircraft  loses thrust on takeoff.   One example (Figure 7.21.) at Albuquerque Int‘l Sunport, reveals that a  takeoff  on  Runway  8  commands  an  excessive  climb  gradient  (515‘/NM).    A comparison  with  Figure  7.22.  shows  the  SDP  for  runway  8  at  KABQ  gives  maximum gross  weights  and  temperatures  which,  if  adhered  to,  allow  the  multi-engine  aircraft  to depart Rwy 8 without meeting the 515‘/NM climb gradient OEI.  Notice the SDP routing differs from the ODP routing.  USAF pilots shall fly SDP routing that differs from ATC routing only in an emergency. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   145  Figure 7.21.  KABQ Normal Obstacle Departure Procedures.  7.5.1.2.1.  If  the  mission  justifies  the  increased  risk,  and  the  aircraft  cannot  meet  or exceed  the  published  climb  gradient,  and  a  current  SDP  exists  for  your  aircraft  and departure runway, consider using that SDP for departure planning.  MAJCOMS may authorize  SDP  use  when  operationally  necessary.    Proper  use  of  the  SDP  for  OEI departure  planning  requires  careful  preflight  review  of  the  procedure.    If  flying  the filed  or  cleared  routing  and  an  engine  failure  occurs,  the  pilot  must  be  ready  to immediately  transition  to  the  SDP  routing  and  climb  profile.    This  preflight  review must also recognize that at a certain point, transition to the SDP may not be feasible (e.g.  a turn during the departure takes the aircraft away from the SDP ground track.) MAJCOMs must train and certify their pilots prior to use of an SDP.  Training will include detailed information about SDPs from the OpsData User‘s Guide.

KABQ Special Departure Procedure.  7.6.  RNAV  Departure  Procedures  (Figure  7  23).    RNAV  Departure  Procedures  take advantage  of  RNAV  system  capabilities  to  provide  more  accurate  and  reliable  position information than traditional NAVAID-based systems. 7.6.1.  Levels  of  service.    All  public  RNAV  SIDs  and  graphic  ODPs  are  RNAV  1  which require  the  aircraft‘s  total  system  error  remain  bounded  by  +/-  1  NM  for  95%  of  the  total flight time. 7.6.2.  Leg types.  RNAV Departure Procedures contain many different leg types:  Direct to Fix (DF), Heading to Altitude (VA), Track to Fix (TF), etc. 7.6.3.  Waypoint types.  RNAV DPs may contain both Flyover and Flyby waypoints. 7.6.3.1.  A fly-by waypoint is used when an aircraft should begin a turn to the next course prior to reaching the waypoint connecting the two route segments. 7.6.3.2.  Fly-over  waypoints  are  used  when  the  aircraft  must  fly  over  the  point  prior  to starting a turn.  Fly-over waypoints are normally depicted as a circled waypoint symbol. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   147  7.6.4.  Flying  RNAV  Departure  Procedures.    In  order  to  fly  RNAV  DPs,  the  following conditions must be met: 7.6.4.1.  Aircraft equipment must meet requirements specified on the DP. 7.6.4.2.  Aircraft  RNAV  system  must  meet  appropriate  certification  standards  as addressed in AFI 11-202V3. 7.6.4.3.  Procedure must be retrieved in its entirety from a current, approved navigation database.  Waypoint and waypoint type (e.g., flyby, flyover) may not be modified. 7.6.4.4.  Pilots must double check all waypoint names, waypoint type (flyby vs.  flyover), altitude, and airspeed information from the database against information listed on the paper copy of the terminal procedure.  Should differences between the approach chart and  database  arise,  the  published  approach  chart,  supplemented  by  NOTAMs,  holds precedence.  Users  may  not  alter  terminal  procedures  retrieved  from  the  equipment database. 7.6.4.5.  If  GPS  is  used,  RAIM  must  be  available  to  execute  the  procedure.  Terminal (or better) RAIM must be available. 7.6.4.6.  Pilots  must  set  CDI  sensitivity,  either  manually  or  automatically,  at  terminal (+/-1nm,  full  scale  deflection).  For  FMS  equipped  aircraft  without  the  capability  of manually setting the CDI, the departure must be flown with a flight director. 7.6.4.7.  The  system  must  either  provide  RAIM  alerts  based  on  terminal  criteria  or  the pilot must be able to monitor actual navigation performance (ANP). 7.6.4.7.1.  NOTE:    Terminal  RAIM  for  departure  may  not  be  available  unless  the waypoints are part of the active flight plan. 7.6.4.7.2.  NOTE:    Actual  Navigation  Performance  (ANP)  is  a  technical  term  that describes the navigation accuracy of the system.  Other terms synonymous with ANP are Figure of Merit, Estimation of Position Uncertainty, or Quality Factor. 7.6.4.8.  Monitor  ground-based  NAVAIDS  that  are  part  of  the  basic  procedure  as required by aircraft specific flight manuals. 7.6.4.9.  There  are  conventional  DPs  (RNAV  and/or  GPS  does  not  appear  in  title  of procedure)  published  in  FLIP  that  are  retrievable  from  selected  aircraft  navigation databases.  These DPs may be flown using the FMS as the primary means of navigation as long  as the FMS is  FAA AC 90-100A (or equivalent) compliant.   USAF  aircraft are authorized to fly these procedures in IMC provided it is retrieved from the database and ground-based NAVAIDS are installed, operational, tuned, and monitored. 7.6.4.9.1.  Aircrews must verify the information in the database with the published DP.  The  maximum  allowable  difference  between  the  database  course(s)  and published course(s) is ±5° and distances must be within 0.1 nm. 7.6.4.9.2.  In some cases, because of the software programming, there can be tracking inaccuracies  when  flying  non-RNAV/FMS  DPs  using  an  FMS.    These  tracking inaccuracies  have  resulted  in  less-than-required  air  traffic  control  separation  and  air traffic control intervention to prevent a possible Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT) accident.    Non-RNAV/FMS  procedures  often  require  navigational  tracking  over  all   148  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 the specified fixes.  Many FMS databases code the points in these procedures as Fly-By  waypoints,  instead  of  Fly-Over  waypoints.    Unlike  an  RNAV  DP,  which  will specify on the printed  FLIP which  waypoints are Fly-By and  which are  Fly-Over, a conventional DP will not make this distinction.  Consequently, the FMS will lead the turn on these points.  This turn anticipation could result in a turn being started miles prior  to  the  expected  turn  point  depending  on  the  amount  of  required  track  change, wind,  and  true  airspeed.      When  verifying  waypoints  prior  to  flying  a  non-RNAV/FMS DP using an FMS, aircrews must determine how the points are coded (Fly-By vs. Fly-Over) in their database.  If there are large course changes coded as Fly-By  waypoints,  the  aircrew  must  be  prepared  to  manually  intervene  to  ensure the aircraft tracks the procedure as published to remain within protected airspace.  This  is  permissible,  as  this  is  not  altering  the  waypoints  retrieved  from  the database; it is insuring the navigation system properly executes the procedure. 7.6.4.9.3.  Certain segments of a DP may require some manual data input by the pilot, especially when radar vectored to a course or required to intercept a specific course to a  waypoint.  This  is  permissible,  as  this  is  not  altering  the  waypoints  retrieved  from the database; it is ensuring the navigation system can comply with ATC instructions.  The  database  also  may  not  contain  all  of  the  transitions  or  departures  from  all runways and some GPS receivers do not contain DPs in the database. 7.6.4.9.4.  Helicopter-only GPS departure procedures are to be flown at 70 knots or less since turning areas and segment lengths are based on this speed. 7.6.4.10.  Manually  selecting  aircraft  bank  limiting  functions  may  reduce  the  aircraft‘s ability  to  maintain  its  desired  track  and  are  not  recommended.    Pilots  should  recognize manually  selectable  aircraft  bank-limiting  functions  might  reduce  their  ability  to  satisfy ATC path expectations, especially when executing large angle turns. This should not be construed  as  a  requirement  to  deviate  from  Airplane  Flight  Manual  procedures;  rather, pilots should limit the selection of such functions within accepted procedures. 7.6.4.11.  RNAV Off-the-Ground Phraseology.  At certain large commercial airports (i.e., CLT,  DFW  and  ATL),  the  FAA  is  evaluating  new  phraseology  for  SIDs  from  parallel runways.  The evaluation  may result in  system-wide implementation  in the future.  The phraseology,  to  be  issued  with  the  takeoff  clearance,  requires  aircrew  action  to  validate correct programming of runway and departure in the Flight Management System (FMS) prior  to  takeoff.    Pilots  are  expected  to  associate  the  instruction  with  the  flight  path  to their  planned  route  of  flight.    Pilots  can  expect  a  takeoff  clearance  from  ATC  that  will provide  instructions  to  depart  the  runway  either  via  an  RNAV  path  or  via  an  assigned heading to be maintained.  An RNAV path takeoff clearance will direct aircraft to fly the required RNAV path to the initial waypoint on the SID in the ATC clearance.  A typical takeoff clearance will state, for example, ―REACH 55, RNAV to GIRGY, Runway 18C, Cleared  for  takeoff‖.    After  verifying  that  the  correct  runway  and  departure  are  loaded and that the correct  lateral  navigation  mode is  available and ready for use  after takeoff, the expected pilot response is, ―REACH 55, RNAV to GIRGY, Runway 18C, Cleared for takeoff‖.    All  read-backs  must  be  verbatim.    Pilots  must  immediately  advise  ATC  if unable  to  comply  with  the  RNAV  SID  or  if  a  different  RNAV  SID  is  entered  in  the aircraft  FMS.    If  the  takeoff  clearance  does  not  match  the  planned/loaded  procedure, either  request  an  initial  heading  from  tower  or  refuse  the  takeoff  clearance  until  the AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   149  discrepancy is resolved.  Unless ATC has issued a heading to fly in place of the off-the-ground phraseology, engage lateral navigation flight guidance as soon as practical and fly the  departure  precisely.  Strict  compliance  with  the  lateral  and  vertical  tracks  is imperative. Figure 7.23.  RNAV DP.  7.7.  Decision  Tree  For  Departures.  The  Departure  Decision  Tree  (Figure  7.24)  is  an  aid  to ensure  compliance  with  both  IFR  and  VFR  departure  rules.    It  is  important  to  remember  that climb  gradients  must  be  taken  into  account  when  departing  any  airfield  under  any  rules.  Airfields with a published approach have undergone a TERPS review and obstacle assessment.  So, although this chapter is specific to IFR departure procedures, it is worth noting that a climb gradient  check  must  also  be  done  in  order  to  depart  VFR.    Hence,  Figure  7.24  applies  to  both IFR and VFR departures.  Bottom line:  Even when VFR flight is an option, pilots must be aware   150  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 of climb gradients, and if OEI aircraft performance makes a successful departure doubtful, then the  decision  to  depart  and  the  method  used  should  be  scrutinized  at  the  proper  risk  mitigation level, which may be unit leadership, or as high as the MAJCOM staff. Figure 7.24.  Departure Decision Tree.  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   151  Chapter 8 HOLDING 8.1.  Definition. 8.1.1.  Basic.    Holding  is  maneuvering  an  aircraft  in  relation  to  a  navigation  fix  while awaiting  further  clearance.    The  standard  no-wind  holding  pattern  is  flown  by  following  a specified holding course inbound to the holding fix, making a 180° turn to the right, flying a heading outbound to parallel the holding course, and making another 180° turn to the right to intercept  and  follow  the  holding  course  to  the  fix  (Figure  8.1).    The  holding  pattern  is nonstandard when the turns are made to the left.  Unless otherwise instructed by ATC, pilots are expected to hold in a standard pattern.  The standard no-wind length of the inbound leg of the holding pattern is 1 minute when holding at or below 14,000 feet MSL and 1½ minutes when  holding  above  14,000  feet  MSL.    DME  holding  patterns  specify  the  outbound  leg length.  If holding at a DME fix without specified outbound leg length, use timing procedures listed above. Figure 8.1.  Holding Pattern.  8.1.2.  Course  Guidance.    Holding  patterns  have  inbound  course  guidance  provided  by  a VOR, TACAN, NDB, localizer, or RNAV/GPS.  While in holding, the localizer signal is the most  accurate  method  of  determining  aircraft  position.    However,  if  a  VOR,  TACAN  or NDB also defines the holding pattern, it‘s the pilot‘s option as to which NAVAID to use. 8.1.2.1.  NOTE:  AFMAN 11-226 (TERPS), states that the use of TACAN station passage as a  fix  is  not  acceptable  for  holding  fixes  (regardless  of  altitude)  or  high  altitude  initial approach fixes (those IAFs which are at or above FL180).  This restriction is driven by the TACAN  fix  error  involved  in  station  passage.    Therefore,  if  the  aircraft  is  TACAN-only equipped,  do  not  hold  directly  over  a  TACAN  or  VORTAC  facility  or  plan  to  use  these facilities  as  high  altitude  IAFs.    TACAN  station  passage  can  be  used  to  identify  an  IAF below FL180 regardless of whether  the  approach  is  published  as  a  Low  or  High  altitude approach. 8.2.  Holding Instruction.   152  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 8.2.1.  Charted Holding Patterns.  ATC clearances requiring holding where holding patterns are charted, include the following instructions: 8.2.1.1.  Direction.  Direction of holding from the fix. 8.2.1.2.  Holding fix.  The name of the holding fix. 8.2.1.3.  Expect  Further  Clearance.    ATC  is  responsible  to  issue  an  Expect  Further Clearance  Time  (EFC)  based  on  the  best  estimate  of  any  additional  enroute/terminal delays.  Pilots should request an EFC any time they are directed to hold without one. 8.2.1.3.1.  Example:    ―Cleared  to  NIGEL,  hold  east  as  published,  expect  further  clearance at 1645Z, time now 1635Z.‖ 8.2.1.3.1.1.  NOTE:  AIM describes ―charted‖ holding patterns as ―those holding patterns  depicted  on  U.S.  government  or  commercially  produced  (meeting  FAA requirements) low/high altitude enroute, and area or STAR charts.‖  Although the AIM  and  GP  do  not  specifically  mention  the  use  of  published  holding  patterns depicted  on  instrument  approach  procedures,  in  day-to-day  operations  they  are used  frequently.    If  the  controller  clears  you  to  ―hold  as  published‖  using  a holding pattern published on an approach plate, make sure you are holding in the correct pattern.  In some situations, there may be more than one published holding pattern  at  the  same  fix.    (See  Figure  8.2)    If  there  is  any  doubt  about  your clearance,  query  the  controller.  8.2.2.    Non-charted  Holding  Patterns.    If  ATC clears you to hold in a non-charted holding pattern, they will provide you with the following information: 8.2.2.1.  Direction.  Direction of holding from the fix. 8.2.2.2.  Holding fix. The holding fix. 8.2.2.3.  Holding course.  Radial, course, bearing, airway, or route on which the aircraft is to hold. 8.2.2.4.  Leg length.  Outbound leg length in miles, if DME or RNAV is to be used. 8.2.2.5.  Direction of turn.  Left turns, if nonstandard. 8.2.2.6.  Expect  Further  Clearance.    Time  to  expect  further  clearance  and  any  pertinent additional delay information. 8.2.2.6.1.  Example:  Hold Northwest of the 106 radial, 40 DME fix, 10-mile legs, left turns.  Expect further clearance at 1725Z, time now 1710Z. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   153  Figure 8.2.  Charted Holding Pattern.  8.2.3.  Clearance  Limit.    ATC  should  issue  holding  instructions  at  least  5  minutes  before reaching a clearance limit fix.  When an aircraft is 3 minutes or less from a clearance limit and  a  clearance  beyond  the  fix  has  not  been  received,  the  pilot  is  expected  to  start  a  speed reduction so that the aircraft will cross the fix at or below the maximum holding airspeed.  If holding instructions have not been received upon arrival at the fix, hold in accordance with procedures in FLIP.  For two-way radio failure holding procedures, refer to the FIH. 8.2.4.  Maximum Holding Speeds.  Maximum holding airspeeds are defined by TERPS and have  nothing  to  do  with  the  holding  speed  specified  in  the  aircraft  flight  manual.    Holding speeds  in  the  aircraft  flight  manual  are  typically  minimum  speeds  that  correspond  to  a maximum  endurance speed.   Do  not  exceed  the  maximum  holding  airspeeds  listed  below. (Table  8.1)  ATC  may  be  able  to  approve  holding  speeds  in  excess  of  these  maximums,  if aircraft  performance  considerations  require.    Adherence  to  the  maximum  speeds  shown below, or the published maximum holding speed, whichever is lower, will ensure you remain within protected airspace. For ICAO holding airspeeds, refer to Chapter 17. Table 8.1.  Maximum Holding Airspeeds. ALTITUDE (MSL) MHA through 6,000‘ Above 6,000‘ through Maximum Speed 200 KIAS 230 KIAS   154  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 14,000‘ Above 14,000‘ 265 KIAS 8.2.4.1.  NOTE:  At USAF airfields, the maximum holding airspeed is 310 KIAS unless otherwise noted.   At USN airfields, the maximum  holding airspeed is  230 KIAS  unless otherwise noted. 8.3.  Holding Pattern Procedures. 8.3.1.  Holding Procedure.  The angular difference between the inbound holding course and the heading at initial holding fix passage determines the direction of turn to enter the holding pattern.    Holding  pattern  sizes  can  vary  greatly  depending  on  the  altitude  of  the  holding pattern,  primary  aircraft  the  procedure  was  designed  for,  and  other  factors.    Pilots  have  no way of knowing the design limits of protected airspace for a particular holding pattern. 8.3.2.  Established  in  Holding.    You  are  considered  established  in  the  holding  pattern  upon initial passage of the holding fix. 8.3.3.  Bank Angle.  Unless  correcting for known winds, make all turns during entry and while  holding  at:    3  degrees  per  second,  or  30  degree  bank  angle,  or  bank  angle commanded  by  the  flight  director  system,  whichever  requires  the  least  bank  angle.  The bank  angle  on  the  entry  turn  may  be    varied  (up  to  30  degrees  maximum)  to  obtain  the desired displacement in the holding pattern. 8.3.4.  Entry  Turns.    There  are  a  number  of  techniques  to  enter  holding  which  should  keep you within holding airspace.  Although any technique may be used to enter holding, using the commonly accepted ones described below will keep you within holding airspace and  insure your  actions  are  predictable  to  the  air  traffic  controller.    Therefore,  it  is  recommended  that you use one of the described techniques. 8.3.4.1.  Technique A (―70 Degree Method‖ Figure 8.3): 8.3.4.1.1.  Within  70°.    If  the  inbound  holding  course  is  within  70°  of  the  aircraft heading,  turn  outbound  in  the  direction  of  holding  and  onto  the  holding  side  (direct entry)  Upon completion of the outbound  leg, proceed direct  or intercept  the holding course to the fix. 8.3.4.1.2.  Not  within  70°.    If  the  inbound  holding  course  is  not  within  70°  of  the aircraft heading, turn outbound in the shorter direction to parallel the holding course.  If  this  turn  places  you  on  the  non-holding  side,  either  parallel  (adjust  for  wind)  or attempt to intercept the holding course inbound.   If you are on the non-holding side or  on  the  holding  course  at  the  completion  of  the  outbound  leg,  turn  toward  the holding side, then proceed direct or intercept the holding course to the fix. 8.3.4.1.3.  Teardrop.    The  teardrop  entry  may  be  used  at  pilot  discretion  when entering holding on a heading conveniently aligned with the selected teardrop course.  As  a  guide,  consider  yourself  conveniently  aligned  when  your  aircraft  heading  is within 45° of the selected teardrop course.  Upon reaching the holding fix, turn on the holding side and proceed on an outbound track not to exceed 45° from the outbound course.    (Depending  on  your  offset  requirements,  a  teardrop  course  of  less  than  45° may  be  desired.)    If  course  guidance  is  available,  attempt  to  intercept  the  selected teardrop  course  outbound. teardrop   Upon  completion  of the  outbound AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   155  course/heading,  turn  toward  the  holding  course  to  intercept  the  holding  course inbound. Figure 8.3.  70 degree Method.  8.3.4.2.  Technique B (―AIM Method‖):  Enter the holding pattern based on your heading (±5°) relative to the three entry sectors depicted in Figure 8.4.  Upon reaching the holding fix, follow the appropriate procedure for your entry sector: 8.3.4.2.1.  Sector  A  (Parallel).    Turn  to  a  heading  to  parallel  the  holding  course outbound for the appropriate time or distance, then turn towards the holding side and return to the holding fix or intercept the holding course inbound. 8.3.4.2.2.  Sector B (Teardrop).  Turn outbound to a heading for a 30-degree teardrop entry (on the holding side) for the appropriate time or distance, and then turn towards the holding course to intercept the inbound holding course.   156  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 8.3.4.2.3.  Sector C (Direct).  Turn to follow the holding pattern. Figure 8.4.  AIM Method.  8.3.5.  Timing.  The maximum inbound leg time is 1 minute at or below 14,000 feet MSL and  1½  minutes  above  14,000  feet  MSL.    On  the  initial  outbound  leg  do  not  exceed  the appropriate  time  for  the  altitude.    Adjust  subsequent  outbound  legs  as  necessary  to  meet the  required  inbound  time.    When  a  specific  DME  or  RNAV  distance  is  specified, commence  the  inbound  turn  at  that  distance.    ATC  expects  pilots  to  fly  the  complete holding  pattern  as  published.    Therefore,  do  not  shorten  the  holding  pattern  without clearance from ATC. 8.3.5.1.  Outbound.  Begin outbound timing when over or abeam the fix.  If you cannot determine the abeam position, start timing when wings level outbound. 8.3.5.2.  Inbound.  Begin inbound timing when wings level inbound. 8.3.5.3.  TACAN/DME/RNAV.    For  TACAN,  charted  DME  holding,  or  RNAV holding; start turns at the specified DME limit or RNAV distance. 8.3.5.4.  Timed  Approaches.    When  pilots  receive  a  clearance  specifying  the  time  to depart a holding pattern, adjust the pattern within the limits of the established holding procedure so as to depart at the time specified. 8.4.  FMS  Holding  Procedures.  FMSs  may  provide  navigation  guidance  for  holding  pattern construction  and  entry.    Depending  on  specific  aircraft  equipage,  FMS  holding  pattern  entry procedures may not match FAA or ICAO standards.  Aircrews are responsible for understanding aircraft-specific FMS holding procedures and ensuring that holding entry  procedures match the appropriate FAA/ICAO procedures.  In some cases, pilot intervention may be required. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   157  8.5.  Holding  Pattern  Suggestions.  Here  are  some  suggestions  and  points  to  consider  when flying holding patterns (Figure 8.5): 8.5.1.  Copying Holding Instructions. 8.5.1.1.  Direction.  Compare the direction of holding to the wind arrow used in weather depictions.  (The wind arrow shows the direction from which the wind comes.) 8.5.1.2.  Fix.  The head of the arrow is the fix; fly the inbound course to the head. 8.5.1.3.  Draw.  Draw or visualize the remainder of the pattern by the instructions given. 8.5.2.  Timing. 8.5.2.1.  Inbound  Legs.    After  completing  the  first  circuit  of  the  holding  pattern,  adjust the time outbound  as necessary to provide the desired inbound  times.    In extreme wind conditions,  even  though  the  turn  inbound  is  initiated  immediately  after  completing  the outbound turn, the inbound leg may exceed the 1 or 1½ minute limit.  In this case,  you are authorized to exceed the time limit inbound. 8.5.2.2.  Adjustments.  Knowing the time it takes you to fly a holding pattern will allow you  to  meet  an  EFC.    As  an  approximation,  1/100th  of  TAS  will  give  the  number  of minutes  to  fly  a  360°  turn  at  30°  of  bank.    (For  example,  at  350  knots  true  airspeed (KTAS),  a  360°  turn  takes  about  3.5  minutes.)  Aircraft  flying  standard  rate  turns  cover 360° in 2 minutes.  Add to the time for turning the number of minutes to fly the inbound and outbound legs.   158  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 Figure 8.5.  Copying Holding Instructions.  8.6.  Drift Corrections. 8.6.1.  Calculating drift corrections.  Knowledge of drift correction and TAS relationship can be  very  useful,  especially  in  those  instances  where  course  guidance  is  not  available;  for example,  the  outbound  leg  of  a  holding  pattern  or  a  procedure  turn.    The  following techniques  may  be  used  to  determine  approximate  drift  correction  when  the  crosswind component is known: 8.6.1.1.  Mach.    Divide  the  crosswind  component  by  the  mach  times  10.    Example:  50 knots crosswind and 300 KTAS (.5M) = 10° drift correction, or 8.6.1.2.  TAS.    Divide  the  crosswind  component  by  the  aircraft  speed  in  nautical  miles per minute.  Example: 30 knots crosswind and 180 KTAS (3NM per minute) 30÷3 = 10° drift correction. 8.6.2.  Applying drift corrections.  Compensate for wind effect primarily by drift correction on the inbound and outbound legs.  When outbound, triple the inbound drift correction; e.g., if correcting left by 8 degrees when inbound, correct right by 24 degrees when outbound. 8.7.  High  Altitude  Approach  Plate  Depiction  (postage  stamp).  Holding  pattern  entry  turns depicted on high altitude approach charts are provided for pilot convenience and are consistent with the intent of the AIM entry procedures. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   159  8.8.  Descent.  If established in a holding pattern that has a published minimum holding altitude, and  assigned  an  altitude  above  that  published  altitude,  pilots  may  descend  to  the  published minimum holding altitude when cleared for the approach (unless specifically restricted by ATC).  Minimum holding altitude is the same as the IAF altitude for holding patterns where the IAF is located  in  the  holding  pattern  unless  otherwise  noted  or  depicted.    For  those  holding  patterns where  there  is  no  published  minimum  altitude  at  the  IAF  and  no  depicted  holding  altitude,  the minimum holding altitude is the same as the minimum altitude at the FAF (or next segment).  In this  case,  upon  receiving  an  approach  clearance,  maintain  the  last  assigned  altitude  until established on a segment of the instrument approach procedure being flown.  (If a lower altitude is desired, request clearance from the controlling agency.)   160  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 Chapter 9 ARRIVAL 9.1.  En Route Descent Procedure/Technique. 9.1.1.  En route.  The en route descent frequently allows a pilot to transition from an en route altitude to the final approach instead of flying an entire FLIP IAP.  It may be flown either via radar vectors or nonradar routings, using approved navigation aids.  ATC will not insist on an en  route  descent.    ATC  will  not  authorize  an  en  route  descent  if  abnormal  delays  are anticipated,  nor  will  they  terminate  the  service  without  the  pilot's  consent  except  in  an emergency. 9.1.2.  Final Approach.  The type of final approach to be flown must be understood by  you and  the  controller  (ILS,  PAR,  visual  pattern,  etc.).    Except  for  radar  finals,  request  an  en route descent to a specific final approach.  If the requested en route descent is to a radar final, select a backup approach that is compatible with existing weather and aircraft equipment.  If you  experience  lost  communications,  you  are  automatically  cleared  to  fly  any  published approach.  For further guidance on lost communications, see the FIH. 9.2.  Descent.  ATC requirements probably have more influence over when to begin the descent than any other single factor.  Prior to requesting an enroute descent, consider your range, desired descent  rate,  weather,  terrain,  and  low  altitude  fuel  consumption.    Pilots  shall  maintain  last assigned  altitude  until  receiving  authorizations/clearance  to  change  altitude.    At  that  time, pilots are expected to comply with all published/issued restrictions. 9.2.1.  Descend  at  an  optimum  rate  (consistent  with  the  operating  characteristics  of  the aircraft) to 1,000 feet above the assigned altitude then reduce your rate of descent to 500 to 1,500 fpm until the assigned altitude is reached. If at any time you are unable to descend at a  rate  of  at  least  500  fpm,  advise  ATC.  Advise  ATC  if  it  is  necessary  to  level  off  at  an intermediate altitude during descent. An exception to this is when leveling off at 10,000 feet MSL on descent, or 2,500 feet above airport elevation (prior to entering a Class B, Class C, or Class D surface area) when required for speed reduction. 9.2.1.1.  NOTE:    FAA  controllers  are  not  required  to  respond  to  clearance  readbacks.  However,  if  the  readback  is  incorrect  or  incomplete,  the  controller  should  make corrections.    Absence  of  a  correction  does  not  imply  your  readback  was  correct.    The controller may not hear the mistaken readback.  If you are unsure of the clearance and/or instructions, query the controller. 9.2.1.2.  CAUTION:    Descent  gradients  in  excess  of  10°  (1,000  ft/nm)  in  IMC  may induce spatial disorientation.  In addition, exceeding a 10° descent gradient below 15,000 feet AGL substantially decreases margin for error in avoiding obstacles and terrain, and may not provide effective radar monitoring. 9.2.2.  Starting  Descent.    Before  starting  descent,  review  the  IAP,  recheck  the  weather  (if appropriate), check the heading and attitude systems, and coordinate lost communication procedures  (if  required).    Review  of  the  IAP  should  include,  but  is  not  limited  to,  the following:  minimum  and/or emergency safe altitudes, navigation  frequencies, descent  rates, AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   161  approach  minimums,  missed  approach  departure  instructions,  and  aerodrome  sketch.  The IAP shall be readily available to the pilot for reference throughout the procedure. 9.2.3.  During Descent. 9.2.3.1.  Descent Rate.  During the descent, control descent rate and airspeed to  comply with any altitude or range restrictions imposed by ATC. 9.2.3.2.  Reduce Airspeed.  Reduce airspeed to 250 KIAS or less when below 10,000 feet MSL as required by AFI 11-202V3. 9.2.3.3.  Radar Vectors.  When descending via radar vectors, remain oriented in relation to the final approach fix by using all available navigation aids.  Have the IAP available for  the  approach  to  be  flown  along  with  an  alternate  or  backup  procedure  to  be  used  if available.  Note the minimum safe, sector, or emergency safe altitudes.  Once cleared for the  approach,  maintain  the  last  assigned  altitude  and  heading  until  established  on  a segment  of  a  published  route  or  IAP.    If  at  any  time  there  is  doubt  as  to  whether adequate  obstacle  clearance  is  provided  or  controller  instructions  are  unclear,  query  the controller.  The controller should inform you if radar contact is lost and provide you with a new clearance or additional instructions.   If  advised that radar  contact  is lost while in IMC  and  there  is  a  delay  in  receiving  new  instructions,  ask  the  controller  for  a  new clearance  or  advise  the  controller  of  your  intentions.    This  is  particularly  important  if below minimum safe, sector, or emergency safe altitude. 9.3.  Established  on  Course.  Established  on  course  is  defined  as  being  within  half  full-scale deflection  for  a  VOR/TACAN/RNAV/GPS  course,    within  ±  5°  of  the  required  bearing  for  an NDB  and  within  full  scale  deflection  for  a  LOC  based  course.    Therefore,  do  not  consider yourself “established on course” until you are within these limits. 9.4.  High Altitude Procedures. 9.4.1.  Terminal  Routings (Figure 9.1).  Terminal routings from  en route or feeder facilities normally  provide  a  course  and  range  in  nautical  miles  (not  DME)  to  the IAF  but  may  take you to a point other than the IAF.   162  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 Figure 9.1.  Feeder Routes (High Altitude).  9.4.2.  Before the IAF.  Before reaching the IAF, review  the IAP, recheck the weather  (if appropriate),  check  the  heading  and  attitude  systems,  and  obtain  clearance  for  the approach.  If holding is not required, reduce to penetration airspeed or below before reaching the IAF.  Accomplish appropriate checklists in accordance with the aircraft flight manual. 9.4.3.  En route Approach Clearance.  If cleared for an approach while en route to holding fix  that  is  not  collocated  with  the  IAF,  proceed  to  the  IAF  via  the  holding  fix,  unless specifically cleared to proceed direct to the IAF.  However, if the IAF is located along the route  of  flight  to  the  holding  fix,  begin  the  approach  at  the  IAF.    If  in  doubt  as  to  the clearance, query the controller. 9.4.4.  Approach Clearance (Figure 9.2).  When ATC issues an approach clearance, proceed to the IAF then turn immediately in the shortest direction to intercept the approach course.  Clearance for the approach does not include clearance to use holding airspace.   However, if you are established in holding and cleared for the approach, complete the holding pattern to the IAF unless an early turn is approved by ATC.  If aircraft heading to the IAF is within 90° of the approach course, pilots may use normal lead points to intercept the course (Figure 9.3).  If aircraft heading is not within 90° of the approach course and you desire to maneuver the aircraft into a more favorable  alignment  prior to  starting the  approach, obtain clearance from ATC. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   163  Figure 9.2.  Cleared for the Approach While En Route to the Holding Fix. Figure 9.3.  Leading the Turn at the IAF.   9.4.5.  Altitude.  When cleared for the approach, maintain the last assigned altitude until established on a segment of the published routing or IAP.  Once on the published routing or  a  segment  on  the  IAP,  do  not  descend  below  the  minimum  safe  altitude  for  that segment.  High altitude penetration descent may be initiated when abeam or past the IAF with  a  parallel  or  intercept  heading  to  the  course.    The  controller  should  assign  you  the depicted IAF altitude.  If you are not assigned the IAF altitude and cannot make the descent gradient by starting the penetration from your last assigned altitude, request a lower altitude. 9.4.5.1.  NOTE:    For  non-DME  teardrop  approaches,  you  should  not  penetrate  from  an altitude  above  the  depicted  IAF  altitude.    If  maneuvering,  such  as  a  holding  pattern,  is   164  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 necessary  to  lose  excess  altitude,  obtain  clearance  to  do  so  in  order  to  comply  with subsequent mandatory altitudes. 9.5.  Low Altitude Procedures. 9.5.1.  Terminal routings.  Terminal routings from en route or feeder facilities are considered segments of the IAP and normally provide a course, range, and minimum altitude to the IAF.  They may take the aircraft to a point other than the IAF if it is operationally advantageous to do so.  A low altitude IAF is any fix labeled as an IAF or any procedure turn/holding-in-lieu-of a procedure turn fix. 9.5.2.  Ranges and Altitudes.  Ranges published along the terminal  routing are expressed in nautical  miles  (not  DME).    The  altitudes  published  on  terminal  routing  are  minimum altitudes and provide the same protection as an airway MEA. 9.5.3.  Before the IAF.  Before reaching the IAF, review  the IAP, recheck the weather  (if appropriate),  check  the  heading  and  attitude  systems,  and  obtain  clearance  for  the approach.    If  holding  is  not  required,  reduce  to  maneuvering  airspeed  before  reaching  the IAF.  Accomplish appropriate checklists in accordance with the aircraft flight manual. 9.5.4.  Enroute Approach Clearance.  If cleared for an approach while en route to a holding fix  that  is  not  collocated  with  the  IAF,  either  proceed  via  the  holding  fix  or  request clearance direct to the IAF (Figure 9.2).  If the IAF is located along the route of flight to the  holding  fix,  begin  the  approach  at  the  IAF.    If  you  overfly  a  transition  fix,  fly  the approach via the terminal routing.  If in doubt as to the clearance, query the controller. 9.5.5.  Altitude.  When cleared for the approach, maintain the last assigned altitude until established on a segment of a published route or IAP.  At that time, the pilot may descend to the minimum altitude associated with that segment of the published routing or instrument approach procedure. 9.5.6.  Approach  Clearance.    When  clearance  for  the  approach  is  issued,  ATC  expects  an immediate turn in the shortest direction to intercept the procedural course upon reaching the IAF.    Clearance  for  the  approach  does  not  include  clearance  for  the  holding  airspace.  However,  if  established  in  holding  and  cleared  for  the  approach,  complete  the  holding pattern to the IAF unless an early turn is approved by ATC.  If your heading is within 90° of  the  procedural  course,  you  may  use  normal  lead  points  to  intercept  the  course.    If  your heading is not within 90° of the approach course and you desire to maneuver the aircraft into a more favorable alignment prior to starting the approach, obtain clearance from ATC. 9.6.  Radar Vectors (Figure 9  4).  The use of radar vectors is the simplest and most convenient way to  position an aircraft for  an approach.   Using radar, air traffic controllers can position an aircraft at almost any desired point, provide obstacle clearance by the use of minimum vectoring altitudes (MVAs), and ensure traffic separation.  This flexibility allows an aircraft to be vectored to any segment of a published routing shown on the IAP or to a radar final.  Radar controllers use MVA charts that are prepared by the air traffic facilities at locations where there are numerous different minimum IFR altitudes.  The MVA chart is divided into sectors that are large enough to accommodate  vectoring  of  aircraft  within  the  sector  at  the  MVA.    Minimum  altitudes  are established  at  1,000  feet  or  2,000  feet  in  designated  mountainous  areas  (in  mountainous  areas, MVAs may be authorized at 1,000 feet in order to achieve compatibility with terminal routes or IAPs).  When being radar vectored, IFR altitude assignments will be at or above MVA. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   165  Figure 9.4.  Minimum Vector Altitude (MVA) Chart.  9.6.1.  "Traffic Advisories" is an additional service that the controller may provide to you if the workload permits.  Traffic information while on a PAR final is almost nil due to narrow azimuth scan of the PAR equipment.  "Radar monitoring" during a nonprecision instrument approach will not provide altitude warning information if the aircraft descends below a safe altitude.  The controller  may vector the aircraft to  any segment  of an  IAP prior to the FAF and clear an aircraft for an approach from that point.  The controller will issue an approach clearance only after you are established on a segment of the IAP; or you will be assigned an altitude to maintain until you are established on a segment of the IAP.  The following general guidance applies to the radar controller when positioning an aircraft for a final approach: 9.6.2.  Radar  Vector  Weather  Requirements.    When  the  reported  ceiling  is  at  least  500  feet above  the  minimum  vectoring  altitude  and  the  visibility  is  at  least  3  miles,  aircraft  will  be vectored to intercept the final approach course as follows: 9.6.2.1.  At least 1 mile from the FAF at a maximum intercept angle of 20°. 9.6.2.2.  At least 3 miles from the FAF at a maximum intercept angle of 30°. 9.6.3.  Final  Approach  Intercept  Requirements.    At  all  other  times,  unless  specifically requested by the pilot, aircraft will be vectored to intercept the final approach course at least 3 miles from the FAF at a maximum intercept angle of 30°. 9.6.4.  Vectoring Requirements.  In either case, aircraft will be vectored: 9.6.4.1.  At an altitude not above the glide slope for a precision approach.   166  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 9.6.4.2.  At an altitude that will allow descent in accordance with the published procedure for a nonprecision approach. 9.6.4.3.  NOTE:  These procedures do not apply to vectors to a visual approach. 9.7.  Pilot Responsibilities. 9.7.1.  During  Vectors.    While  being  radar  vectored,  the  pilot  will  repeat  all  headings, altitudes  (departing  and  assigned),  and  altimeter  settings;  and  comply  with  controller instructions. 9.7.2.  Orientation.  Remain oriented in relation to the final approach fix by using available navigation aids.  The pilot will have the IAP available for the approach to be flown.  Note the minimum sector, or emergency safe altitudes.  Start the before-landing checklist (landing check),  review  approach  minimums,  and  determine  the  approximate  initial  rate  of  descent required  on  final  approach.    Once  approach  clearance  is  received,  the  pilot  will  maintain the  last  assigned  altitude  and  heading  until  established  on  a  segment  of  a  published routing or IAP.  Comply with all course and altitude restrictions as depicted on the approach procedure  except  that  you  must  not  climb  above  the  last  assigned  altitude  to  comply  with published altitude restrictions unless so instructed by the controlling agency.  Establish final approach  configuration  and  airspeed  prior  to  the  FAF  (unless  flight  manual  procedures require otherwise). 9.7.3.  Maneuvering.    If  maneuvering  is  required  to  lose  excess  altitude  prior  to  the  FAF, obtain a clearance from the controlling agency.  Descent maneuvering may include execution of a procedure turn, descent in a published holding pattern, additional radar vectors, or other such maneuver. 9.7.3.1.  CAUTION:  If  at  any  time  there  is  doubt  as  to  whether  adequate  obstacle clearance  is  provided,  or  controller  instructions  are  unclear,  query  the  controller.    The controller  should  inform  you  if  radar  contact  is  lost  and  give  a  new  clearance  or instructions.  If you are advised that radar contact is lost and there is a delay in receiving new instructions, ask the controller for  a new  clearance or  advise the controller of  your intentions.    This  is  particularly  important  if  below  minimum  sector,  or  emergency  safe altitude. 9.8.  Standard Terminal Arrivals (STARs) (Figure 9  5). 9.8.1.  Definition.  A STAR is an ATC coded IFR arrival route established for assignment to arriving  IFR  aircraft  for  certain  airports.    The  purpose  of  a  STAR  is  to  simplify  clearance delivery  procedures  and  facilitate  transition  between  enroute  and  instrument  approach procedures. 9.8.1.1.  STARs  can  be  based  on  conventional  NAVAIDS  or  RNAV.    For  all  STARs, follow  the  guidance  in  the  following  paragraphs.    For  RNAV-specific  procedures,  see paragraphs 9.8.1.2. 9.8.1.1.1.  Mandatory  Speeds  and/or  Altitudes.    Some  STARs  may  have  mandatory speeds and/or crossing altitudes published.  Some STARs have planning information depicted  to  inform  pilots  what  clearances  or  restrictions  to  ―expect.‖    ―Expect‖ altitudes/speeds  are  not  considered  STAR  restrictions  until  verbally  issued  by  ATC.  They are published for planning purposes and should not be used in the event of lost AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   167  communications  unless  ATC  has  specifically  advised  the  pilot  to  expect  these altitudes/speeds  as  part  of  a  further  clearance.    Additionally,  STARs  will  normally depict MEAs.  MEAs are not considered restrictions.  However, pilots are expected to remain above MEAs. 9.8.1.1.2.  Altitude  Clearance.    Pilots  shall  maintain  last  assigned  altitude  until receiving  authorizations/clearance  to  change  altitude.    At  that  time,  pilots  are expected to comply with all published/issued restrictions.  The authorization may be via a normal descent clearance or the phraseology ―DESCEND VIA.‖ 9.8.1.1.2.1.  Example of Lateral Routing Clearance Only.  ―Track 32, cleared the EAU CLAIRE SIX ARRIVAL.‖  In this case, you are cleared the EAU CLAIRE SIX  routing  but  are  expected  to  maintain  your  present  altitude  awaiting  further clearance. 9.8.1.1.2.2.  Example of Routing with Assigned Altitude.  ―Fame 22, cleared EAU CLAIRE  SIX  arrival;  descend  and  maintain  flight  level  two  four  zero.‖    In  this situation,  you  are  cleared  via  the  EAU  CLAIRE  SIX  routing  and  cleared  to descend to FL240. 9.8.1.1.2.3.  ―DESCEND  VIA‖  Clearances.    A  ―DESCEND  VIA‖  clearance authorizes  pilots  to  vertically  and  laterally  navigate,  in  accordance  with  the depicted  procedure,  to  meet  published  restrictions.    Vertical  navigation  is  at pilot‘s discretion; however, adherence to published altitude crossing restrictions and  speeds  is  mandatory  unless  otherwise  cleared.    MEAs  are  not  considered restrictions;  however, pilots  are expected to remain  above MEAs.  Pilots  cleared for vertical navigation using the phraseology “Descend Via” shall inform ATC upon initial contact with a new frequency.  For example, ―Track 32, descending via the EAU CLAIRE SIX ARRIVAL.‖ 9.8.1.1.2.4.  Example  of  ―DESCEND  VIA‖  Clearance.    ―Track  66,  Descend  Via the EAU CLAIRE SIX arrival.‖  If you receive this ―DESCEND VIA‖ clearance, you are expected to vertically and laterally navigate in accordance with the EAU CLAIRE SIX arrival. 9.8.1.1.3.  Anticipate  Use  of  STARs.    Normally,  pilots  of  IFR  aircraft  destined  to locations where STARs  have been published should expect  to  be issued  a clearance containing the appropriate STAR for the destination airport. 9.8.1.1.4.  Chart Requirement.  Use of STARs requires pilot possession of at least the approved chart.  As with any ATC clearance or portion thereof, it is the responsibility of each pilot to accept or refuse an issued STAR.  Pilots should notify ATC if they do not wish to use a STAR by placing ―NO STAR‖ in the remarks section of the flight plan or by verbally stating the same to ATC (this is the less desirable method). 9.8.1.1.5.  Pilot Responsibilities.  Before filing or accepting a clearance for a STAR, the  pilot  must  ensure  that  he  or  she  can  comply  with  any  altitude  and/or  airspeed restrictions associated with the procedure.  If filed for a STAR in the flight plan, then an  initial  ATC  clearance  of  ―Cleared  as  filed‖  constitutes  clearance  for  the  STAR routing  (not  altitudes)  as  well.    Clearance  for  the  STAR  is  not  clearance  for  the approach the procedure may bring you to.   168  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 9.8.1.1.6.  Where  STARs  Are  Published.        The  DoD  FLIP  STAR  book  contains many,  but  not  all  of  the  CONUS  STARs.    Its  contents  are  determined  by  military requirements. Figure 9.5.  Standard Terminal Arrival (STAR). 9.8.1.2.  RNAV STARs (Figure 9.6).  RNAV STARs can be stand-alone or ―overlay‖.  In order  to  fly  a  STAR  using  RNAV  (either  stand-alone  or  ―overlay‖),  the  pilot  must comply with the following:  9.8.1.2.1.  Aircraft equipment must meet requirements specified on the STAR. 9.8.1.2.2.  Aircraft  RNAV  system  must  meet  appropriate  certification  standards  as addressed in AFI 11-202V3. 9.8.1.2.3.  Procedure  must  be  retrieved  in  its  entirety  from  a  current,  approved navigation  database.  Waypoint and waypoint type (e.g., flyby, flyover)  may not  be modified. 9.8.1.2.4.  Pilots  must  verify  all  waypoint  names,  waypoint  type  (flyby  vs.  flyover), altitude, and airspeed information from the database against information listed on the paper copy of the terminal procedure.  Should differences between the approach chart  and  database  arise,  the  published  approach  chart,  supplemented  by  NOTAMs, holds  precedence.  Users  may  not  alter  terminal  procedures  retrieved  from  the equipment database. 9.8.1.2.4.1.  Aircrews  must  verify  the  information  in  the  database  with  the published  STAR.    The  maximum  allowable  difference  between  the  database course(s) and published course(s) is ±5°. 9.8.1.2.4.2.  Certain  segments of a STAR may require some manual  intervention AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   169  by the pilot, especially when radar vectored to a course or required to intercept a specific  course  to  a  waypoint.    This  is  permissible,  as  this  is  not  altering  the waypoints  retrieved  from  the  database;  it  is  ensuring  the  navigation  system properly executes the procedure. 9.8.1.2.5.  If  GPS procedure.  Terminal (or better) RAIM must be available. is  used,  RAIM  must  be  available to  execute the 9.8.1.2.5.1.  System  must  either  provide  RAIM  alerts  based  on  terminal  criteria, or  pilot  must  be  able  to  monitor  navigation  performance  (Actual  Navigation Performance). 9.8.1.2.5.1.1.  NOTE:    Terminal  RAIM  for  a  STAR  may  not  be  available unless the waypoints are part of the active flight plan. 9.8.1.2.5.1.2.  NOTE:    Actual  Navigation  Performance  (ANP)  is  a  technical term  that  describes  the  navigation  accuracy  of  the  system.    Other  terms synonymous  with  ANP  are  Figure  of  Merit,  Estimation  of  Position Uncertainty, or Quality Factor. 9.8.1.2.6.  Comply  with  any  navigation  system  requirements  if  published  on  the STAR (ex.  /E, /G, etc.). 9.8.1.2.7.  STARs  based  on  conventional  NAVAIDS  in  some  cases  are  retrievable from  an  RNAV  database.  Pilots  will  tune,  identify,  monitor  and  display  the appropriate ground-based NAVAIDs whenever practicable. 9.8.1.2.7.1.  In  some  cases,  because  of  the  software  programming,  there  can  be tracking inaccuracies when flying non-RNAV/FMS STARs using an FMS.  These tracking  inaccuracies  have  resulted  in  less-than-required  air  traffic  control separation  and  air  traffic  control  intervention  to  prevent  a  possible  Controlled Flight  Into  Terrain  (CFIT)  accident.    Non-RNAV/FMS  procedures  often  require navigational tracking over all the specified fixes.  Many FMS databases code the points  in  these  procedures  as  Fly-by  waypoints,  instead  of  Fly-over  waypoints.  Unlike a stand-alone RNAV STAR, which will specify on the printed FLIP which waypoints are Fly-by and which are Fly-over, a conventional STAR will not make this distinction.  Consequently, the FMS will lead the turn on these points.  This turn  anticipation  could  result  in  a  turn  being  started  miles  prior  to  the  expected turn  point  depending  on  the  amount  of  required  track  change,  wind,  and  true airspeed.      When  verifying  waypoints  prior  to  flying  a  non-RNAV/FMS  STAR using an FMS, aircrews must determine how the points are coded (Fly-by vs. Fly-over)  in  their  database.    If  there  are  large  course  changes  coded  as  Fly-by waypoints,  the  aircrew  must  be  prepared  to  manually  intervene  to  insure  the aircraft tracks the procedure as published to remain within protected airspace. 9.8.1.2.8.  Manually  selecting  aircraft  bank  limiting  functions  may  reduce  the aircraft‘s ability to maintain its desired track and are not recommended.  Pilots should recognize  manually  selectable  aircraft  bank-limiting  functions  might  reduce  their ability to satisfy ATC path expectations, especially when executing large angle turns. This should not be construed as a requirement to deviate from Airplane Flight Manual   170  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 procedures; rather, pilots should limit the selection of such functions within accepted procedures. Figure 9.6.  RNAV STAR. 9.9.  Flight Management System Procedures (FMSP) for Arrivals.  9.9.1.  FMSPs  for  arrivals  serve  the  same  purpose  as  STARs  but  are  only  used  by  aircraft equipped  with  Flight  Management  Systems  (FMS).    Procedures  for  flying  FMSPs  are identical  to  any  other  STAR.    FMSPs  will  list  the  equipment  requirements  for  flying  the procedure (/E, /F, etc.). AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   171  Chapter 10 HIGH ALTITUDE APPROACHES 10.1.  Application.  An  en  route  descent  or  a  high  altitude  instrument  approach  enables  an aircraft to transition from the high altitude structure to a position on and aligned with an inbound course to the FAF, at FAF altitude in the final approach configuration.  ATC will usually issue a clearance  for  a  specific  type  of  approach.    The  omission  of  a  specific  type  in  the  approach clearance  indicates  that  any  published  instrument  approach  to  the  aerodrome  may  be  used.  Unless cleared by ATC to deviate, fly the entire instrument approach procedure starting at the IAF. 10.2.  Non-DME  Teardrop  Approaches.  Teardrop  approaches  are  usually  associated  with VOR or NDB facilities (Figure 10.1). 10.2.1.  Station Passage.  When station passage occurs at the IAF, turn immediately in the shorter  direction  toward  the  outbound  course  and  attempt  to  intercept  it.    Begin  descent when established on a parallel or intercept heading to the approach course and outbound from  the  IAF.    If  you  arrive  at  the  IAF  at  an  altitude  below  that  published,  maintain altitude  and  proceed  outbound  15  seconds  for  each  1,000  foot  the  aircraft  is  below  the published  altitude  before  starting  descent.    If  you  arrive  at  the  IAF  at  an  altitude  above that  published,  a  descent  to  the  published  IAF  altitude  should  be  accomplished  prior  to starting the approach.  If descent is required at the IAF, obtain clearance to descend in a holding pattern.  Set the altimeter in accordance with FLIP. 10.2.1.1.  NOTE:  Use  a  descent  gradient  of  800-1,000  ft/NM  (8-10°)  to  ensure  you  remain within protected airspace. 10.2.2.  Fly-off.  Some approaches use a fly-off (altitude or range) restriction before starting descent.  In these cases, the pilot will attempt to intercept the outbound course and comply with  the  altitudes  depicted  on  the  approach  chart  unless  otherwise  instructed  by  ATC.  Since  the  pilot  cannot  be  expected  to  determine  accurate  groundspeed  during  a  constantly changing true airspeed descent, depicted range restrictions should not be shown on non-DME teardrop high altitude approaches.  Penetration turns should be annotated "left or right turn at (altitude)."    When  a  penetration  turn  altitude  is  not  published,  start  the  turn  after descending one-half the total altitude between the IAF and FAF altitudes.  One technique to  determine  the  start  turn  altitude  is  to  add  the  IAF  and  FAF  altitudes  and  divide  by  two.  Before reaching the penetration turn altitude, set up the navigation equipment to intercept the  published  inbound  approach  course.    Recheck  the  altimeter  and  the  direction  of penetration turn. 10.2.3.  Penetration Turn.  Fly the penetration turn in the direction published.  A 30° angle of  bank  is  normally  used  during  the  penetration  turn;  however,  bank  may  be  shallowed  if undershooting  course.    If  it  is  apparent  that  you  will  undershoot  the  inbound  penetration course, roll out on an intercept heading.  Use normal inbound course interception procedures to intercept the course. 10.2.3.1.  NOTE:    If  a  penetration  turn  completion  altitude  is  depicted,  do  not  descend below  this  altitude  until  you  are  established  on  the  inbound  segment  of  the  published approach  procedure.    Remember,  obstacle  clearance  is  based  on  the  pilot  attempting  to   172  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 maintain the course centerline; a pilot must use position orientation and pilot judgment to determine when to descend while attempting to intercept the course. 10.2.4.  Descent.    Continue  descent  to  FAF  altitude.    Establish  approach  configuration  and airspeed  prior  to  the  final  approach  fix  unless  the  aircraft  flight  manual  procedures  require otherwise. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   173  Figure 10.1.  Non-DME Teardrop-High Altitude Approach. 10.3.  Radial  Approaches.  These  approaches  are  associated  with  TACAN  or  VORTAC facilities (Figure 10.2).  One or more radials form the entire approach track. 10.3.1.  Crossing  the  IAF.    When  over  the  IAF,  turn  immediately  in  the  shorter  direction toward  the  approach  course.    Intercept  the  published  approach  course  using  appropriate    174  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 course intercept  procedures.    If  your heading is  within 90° of the approach course,  you are not required to overfly the IAF; you may use normal lead points to intercept the course. 10.3.2.  Descent.  Start the descent when the aircraft is abeam or past the IAF on a parallel or  intercept  heading  to  the  approach  course.    For  DME  approaches,  crossing  the  arc  is considered abeam the IAF.  Intercept the course and comply with the altitudes depicted on the  approach  chart.  Aircraft configuration and airspeed requirements prior to the FAF are the same as for non-DME teardrop. Figure 10.2.  Radial - High Altitude Approach.  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   175  Figure 10.3.  Radial and Arc Combination Approach.  10.4.  Radial and Arc Combination Approaches (Figure 10  3).  These require the use of arc intercept  procedures.    Flight  procedures  are  the  same  as  for  a  radial  approach.    However,  if established in a holding pattern and the IAF is located on an arc or on a radial at a distance less than  that  required  for  a  normal  lead  point,  you  may  turn  early  to  intercept  the  arc.    Start  the descent  when  you  are  established  on  an  intercept  to  the  arc  and  abeam  or  past  the  IAF  in relation to the initial approach track.  Aircraft configuration and airspeed requirements prior to the FAF are the same as for non-DME teardrop. An arc or radial altitude restriction only applies while established on that segment of the approach to which the altitude restriction applies.  Once a lead point is reached, and a turn to the next segment is initiated, the pilot may descend to the next  applicable  altitude  restriction.    This  may  be  especially  important  to  facilitate  a  reasonable rate of descent to final approach fix altitude.   176  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 10.4.1.  NOTE:  When an altitude restriction is depicted at a fix defined as an intersection of a radial and an ARC the restriction must be complied with no later than the completion of the lead  turn  associated  with  that  fix.    If  the  restriction  is  met  during  the  lead  turn,  consider yourself  established  on  the  next  segment  and  continue  to  descend  to  the  next  applicable altitude restriction. 10.5.  Multiple  Facility  Approaches  (Figure  10  4).    The  multiple  facility  type  approach normally uses a combination of two or more VORs, NDB, TACANs, etc., to provide the track. 10.5.1.  Entry  Procedures.    The  approach  entry  procedures  are  the  same  as  prescribed  for non-DME teardrop approaches. 10.5.2.  Restriction.    The  entire  approach  must  be  flown  as  depicted  to  comply  with  all course  and  altitude  restrictions.    Aircraft  configuration  and  airspeed  requirements  prior  to the FAF are the same as for non-DME teardrop approaches. Figure 10.4.  Multiple Facility Approach.  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   177  10.6.  Approach With Dead Reckoning (DR) Courses.  Many IAPs utilize DR courses (Figure 10.5).

Low altitude approaches are used to transition aircraft from the low altitude environment  to  final  approach  for  landing.    Low  altitude  instrument  approach  procedures  exist for one purpose -- to assist you in guiding your aircraft to the final approach fix, on course, on altitude, and in the final approach configuration (Figure 11.1).  It has become normal to expect ATC to provide radar vectors to final; however, you must always be prepared to execute the ―full procedure‖ when appropriate. 11.1.1.  NOTE:    This  chapter  deals  primarily  with  low  altitude  approaches  flown  in  FAA airspace.      All  procedures  detailed  in  this  chapter  apply  to  FAA  and  ICAO  airspace  unless annotated otherwise in Chapter 17, ICAO Procedures. 11.1.2.  CAUTION:    Aircrews  should  use  caution  when  flying  a  ―high  altitude‖  IAP  in  the low  altitude  environment,  especially  if  there  are  multiple  approaches  based  on  the  same NAVAID at the airport.  If you are receiving radar vectors in the low altitude structure, ATC expects you to fly the low altitude version of the approach.  Often the high and low altitude approaches are the same, but sometimes they are not.  Ask for and receive a clearance for the exact  approach  you  intend  to  fly.    Query  the  controller  if  you  receive  an  unclear  or incomplete approach clearance. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   179  Figure 11.1.  Low Altitude Approach.  11.2.  Overview.  There  are  two  broad  categories  of  low  altitude  approaches:    course  reversals and procedure tracks.  Before we look at each type in detail, here are some guidelines that apply to all low altitude approaches: 11.2.1.  Initial Approach Fix (IAF).  Most approaches begin at an IAF.  ATC will normally clear  you  to  the  appropriate  IAF  and  then  clear  you  for  the  approach.    Unless  ATC specifically  clears  you  otherwise,  you  are  expected  to  fly  to  the  IAF  and  execute  the  full instrument approach procedure as published. 11.2.2.  Final  Approach  Segment.    Some  approaches  depict  only  a  final  approach  segment, starting at the FAF (Figure 11.2).  In these cases, radar is required to ensure you are properly aligned with the final approach course at the appropriate altitude.  When ATC clears you for the  approach,  maintain  the  last  assigned  altitude  until  established  on  a  segment  of  the published IAP.   180  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 Figure 11.2.  Approach Depicting Only the Final Approach Segment.  11.2.3.  Aircraft  Speed.    Prior  to  reaching  the  initial  approach  fix,  the  pilot  must  slow  to aircraft maneuvering speed.  Use holding airspeed if maneuvering airspeed is not specified for your aircraft.  Establish approach configuration and airspeed before the final approach fix unless your aircraft flight manual procedures require otherwise. 11.3.  Types  of  Course  Reversals.  There  are  two  common  types  of  course  reversals:    the procedure turn (PT) (Figure 11.3) and the holding pattern in  lieu of procedure turn (HILO PT) (Figure 11.4). 11.3.1.  Restrictions.    Do  not  execute  a  procedure  turn  or  HILO  PT  in  the  following situations.  (Many people use the memory aid – SNERT). 11.3.1.1.  When ATC gives you clearance for a ―Straight-in‖ approach. 11.3.1.2.  If you are flying the approach via No PT routing (Figure 11.5). AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   181  11.3.1.3.  When  you  are  Established  in  holding,  subsequently  cleared  the  approach,  and the holding course and procedure turn course are the same. 11.3.1.3.1.  NOTE:    This  generally  applies  if  you  are  already  established  at  the minimum  holding  altitude.    If  you  are  in  doubt  as  to  what  action  the  controller expects, query the controller. 11.3.1.4.  When ATC provides Radar vectors to the final approach course. 11.3.1.5.  When  ATC  clears  you  for  a  Timed  approach.    Timed  approaches  are  in progress when you are established in a holding pattern and given a time to depart the FAF inbound. 11.3.1.6.  In  any  of  the  situations  described  above,  proceed  over  the  FAF  at  the published  FAF  altitude  and  continue  inbound  on  the  final  approach  course  without making a procedure turn, holding pattern, or any other aligning maneuver before the FAF  unless  otherwise  cleared  by  ATC.  If  you  need  to  make  additional  circuits  in  a published holding pattern or to become better established on course before departing the FAF, it is your responsibility to request such maneuvering from ATC. 11.3.1.6.1.  NOTE:    Historically,  these  restrictions  have  created  a  lot  of  confusion between pilots and controllers.  If you are ever in doubt about what ATC expects you to do, query the controller.   182  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 Figure 11.3.

One of the most common types of low altitude course reversals is the procedure turn.  Procedure turns are depicted in the plan view of U.S. government charts with a barb  symbol  ( )  indicating  the  direction  or  side  of  the  outbound  course  on  which  the procedure  turn  or  maneuvering  is  to  be  accomplished  (Figure  11.3).    The  procedure  turn  fix  is identified on the profile view of the approach at the point where the IAP begins.  To give you an idea of what the procedure turn airspace looks like, refer to Figure 11.6.   The actual radii of a PT area are dependent on the altitude and airspeed of the specific procedure. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   185  Figure 11.6.  Procedure Turn Area.  11.4.1.  Aircraft  Speed.    Procedure  turns  may  be  safely  flown  at  speeds  up  to  250  KIAS provided  the  pilot  takes  into  consideration  all  factors  which  may  affect  the  aircraft‘s  turn performance (e.g., winds, TAS at altitude, bank angle, etc.). 11.4.1.1.  NOTE:    The  FAA  recommends  a  maximum  airspeed  of  200  KIAS  while performing  procedure  turn  course  reversals,  and  when  possible,  USAF  aircraft  should also  observe  this  speed  restriction.    If  a  speed  of  200  KIAS  is  not  practical,  you  must exercise  caution  to  ensure  your  aircraft  remains  in  the  protected  airspace  provided  by TERPS. 11.5.  Methods for Flying Procedure Turns.  There are three common methods for executing a procedure turn course reversal:  the holding technique, the 45/180, and the 80/260.  Regardless of the method you choose to fly the procedure turn, take the following two notes into consideration when planning your approach: 11.5.1.  Plan  the  outbound  leg  to  allow  enough  time  for  configuration  and  any  descent required prior to the FAF. Adjust the outbound leg length to ensure your aircraft will stay inside the “remain within distance” noted on the profile view of the approach plate.  The remain  within  distance  is  measured  from  the  procedure  turn  fix  unless  the  IAP  specifies otherwise.  At the completion of the outbound leg, turn to intercept the procedure turn course inbound. 11.5.2.  When  the  NAVAID  is  on  the  field  and  no  FAF  is  depicted  (Figure  11.7),  plan  the outbound  leg  so  the  descent  to  MDA  can  be  completed  with  sufficient  time  to  acquire  the runway  and  position  the  aircraft  for  a  normal  landing.    Consideration  should  be  given  to configuring on the outbound leg to minimize pilot tasking on final.  When flying this type of approach,  the  FAF  is  considered  to  be  the  point  when  you  begin  your  descent  from  the procedure  turn  completion  altitude.    Since  this  point  is  considered  the  FAF,  you  should establish  approach  configuration  and  airspeed  prior  to  departing  procedure  turn  completion altitude unless your aircraft flight manual procedures require otherwise.   186  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 Figure 11.7.  Procedure Turn Approach with No FAF Depicted.  11.6.  Holding  Method.  Enter  the  procedure  turn  according  to  the  holding  procedures described in Chapter 8 with the following exceptions: 11.6.1.  If  your  heading  is  within  90°  of  the  outbound  procedure  turn  course,  you  may  use normal lead points to intercept the procedure turn course outbound. 11.6.2.  If you elect a teardrop entry, your teardrop course must be within 30 degrees of the procedure turn course.  Use course guidance if it is available. 11.6.3.  If you intercept  the procedure turn course outbound, maintain the course for the remainder of the outbound leg, then turn toward the maneuvering side to reverse course. 11.6.4.  Timing.    Begin  timing  once  you  are  outbound  abeam  the  procedure  turn  fix.    If you cannot  determine the abeam position while in the turn, start timing after completing the outbound turn. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   187  11.6.5.  Descent.    Do  not  descend  from  the  procedure  turn  fix  altitude  (published  or assigned)  until  abeam  the  procedure  turn  fix  heading  outbound.    If  unable  to  determine when  you  are  abeam,  start  descent  after  completing  the  outbound  turn.    Do  not  descend from the procedure turn completion altitude until  established on the inbound segment  of the approach.  Some procedures may contain a note in the chart profile that says ―Maintain (altitude)  or  above  until  established  outbound  for  procedure  turn‖.    Newer  procedures  will simply depict an ―at or above‖ altitude at the PT fix without a note.  Both are there to ensure required  obstacle  clearance  is  provided  in  the  procedure  turn  entry  zone  (Figure  11.8).  Absence  of  a  chart  note  or  a  specified  minimum  altitude  adjacent  to  the  PT  fix  is  an indication  that  descent  to  the  procedure  turn  altitude  can  commence  immediately  upon crossing over the PT fix, regardless of the direction of flight. Figure 11.8.  PT Fix Altitude. 11.7.  The  45°/180°  and  the  80°/260°  Course  Reversals.  Two other methods to accomplish a procedure  turn  approach  are  the  45°/180°  and  the  80°/260°  course  reversal  maneuvers.    The procedures  for  flying  each  maneuver  are  identical  with  the  exception  of  the  actual  course reversal. 11.7.1.  Entry.    Upon  reaching  the  procedure  turn  fix,  turn  in  the  shortest  direction  to intercept the procedure turn course outbound.  Use normal lead points if practical.    188  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 11.7.2.  Proceeding Outbound.  Intercept and maintain the procedure turn course outbound as soon as possible after passing the procedure turn fix. 11.7.3.  Descent.    Do  not  descend  from  the  procedure  turn  fix  altitude  (published  or assigned) until abeam the procedure turn fix and on a parallel or intercept heading to the outbound  track.    Do  not  descend  from  the  procedure  turn  completion  altitude  until established on the inbound segment of the approach. 11.7.3.1.  NOTE:    When  flying  procedure  turns  designed  in  FAA  airspace,  there  is  no requirement to wait until you are on a parallel or intercept heading to begin descent from the  procedure  turn  fix  altitude;  however,  when  flying  these  types  of  course  reversals  in ICAO airspace, this procedure is MANDATORY due to different TERPS criteria.  In the interest of forming good habit patterns, the ICAO method has been adopted by the USAF as procedural. 11.7.4.  Executing the Course Reversal Maneuver.  At the appropriate time on the outbound leg, begin the course reversal maneuver.  In both cases, comply with the published remain within distance. 11.7.4.1.  The  45°/180°.    To  begin  the  reversal  maneuver,  turn  45°  away  from  the outbound track toward the maneuvering side.  Begin timing upon initiating the 45° turn; time for 1 minute (Categories A and B) or 1 minute and 15 seconds (Categories C, D, and E); then begin a 180° turn in the opposite direction from the initial turn to intercept the procedure turn course inbound. 11.7.4.2.  The 80°/260°.  To begin the reversal maneuver, make an 80° turn away from the outbound track toward  the maneuvering side followed by an immediate 260° turn in the opposite direction to intercept the inbound course. 11.8.  Holding  Pattern  in  Lieu  of  Procedure  Turn  (HILO  PT).  The  HILO  PT  is  another common way to execute a low altitude course reversal.  The HILO PT is depicted like any other holding  pattern  except  the  holding  pattern  track  is  printed  with  a  heavy  black  line  ( )  in  the plan  view.    The  depiction  of  the  approach  in  the  profile  view  varies  depending  on  where  the descent should begin. 11.8.1.  Flying  the  Holding  Pattern.  The  holding  pattern  should  be  flown  as  depicted,  to include leg length or timing.    Enter and fly the HILO PT holding pattern according to the holding procedures described in Chapter 8. 11.8.2.  Descent.  Descent from the minimum holding altitude may be depicted in two ways: descent at the holding fix or descent on the inbound leg.  When a descent is depicted on the inbound  leg,  you  must  be  established  on  the  inbound  segment  of  the  approach  before beginning the descent. 11.8.3.  Additional Guidance for HILO PTs.  If cleared for the approach while holding in a published  HILO  PT,  complete  the  holding  pattern  and  commence  the  approach  without making additional turns in the holding pattern (altitude permitting).  If an additional turn is needed to lose excessive altitude, request clearance from ATC since additional circuits of the holding  pattern  are  not  expected  by  ATC.    If  the  aircraft  is  at  an  altitude  from  which  the approach  can  be  safely  executed  and  you  are  ready  to  turn  inbound  immediately,  you  may request approval for an early turn from ATC. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   189  11.9.  Procedural Tracks. 11.9.1.  Depiction.  There is no specific depiction for a procedural track.  (Figures 11.9, 11.10 and  11.11)  It  may  employ  arcs,  radials,  courses,  turns,  etc.    When  a  specific  flight  path  is required, procedural  track symbology is  used to  depict the flight  path  between the  IAF  and FAF.  The depiction used is a heavy black line showing intended aircraft ground track. Figure 11.9.  Procedure Track Approach (Straight-in).    190  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 Figure 11.10.  Procedure Track Approach (Arcing Final).  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   191  Figure 11.11.  Procedure Track Approach (Arc to Radial).  11.9.2.  Entry.  When over  the IAF, turn immediately in the shorter direction to  intercept the  published  track.   If  your heading is  within 90° of the procedure track course,  you may use  normal  lead  points  to  intercept  the  course.    If  your  heading  is  not  within  90°  of  the course,  overfly  the  fix  and  turn  in  the  shorter  direction  to  intercept  the  procedure  track course. 11.9.3.  Maneuvering.  Conform to the specific ground track shown on the IAP.  Where a teardrop  turn  is  depicted,  you  may  turn  to  the  inbound  course  at  any  time  unless  otherwise restricted  by  the  approach  plate.    Determine  when  to  turn  by  using  the  aircraft  turn performance, winds, and the amount of descent required on the inbound course; however, do not exceed the published remain within distance. 11.9.4.  Descent.  A descent can be depicted at any point along the procedural track.   192  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 11.9.4.1.  IAF.    When  a  descent  is  depicted  at  the  IAF,  start  descent  when  abeam  or past  the  IAF  and  on  a  parallel  or  intercept  heading  to  the  procedural  track  course.  Except  for  initial  descents  at  an  IAF,  be  established  on  the  appropriate  segment  of  the procedural track before descending to the next altitude shown on the IAP. 11.9.4.1.1.  Note: Low altitude approaches may include arc-to-radial, arc-to localizer and  radial-to-arc  combinations.    An  arc-to-radial  and  arc-to  localizer  altitude restrictions  apply  only  while  established  on  that  segment  of  the  IAP.    Once  a  lead point is reached and a turn to the next segment is begun, you may consider yourself established on the next segment and descend to the next applicable altitude.  When an altitude restriction is  depicted at  a fix defined as  an inter  a radial and an arc, the restriction  must  be  complied  with  no  later  than  the  completion  of  the  lead  turn associated  with  that  fix.    If  the  restriction  is  met  during  the  lead  turn,  consider yourself  established  on  the  next  segment,  and  you  may  continue  to  descend  to  the next applicable altitude restriction. 11.9.4.1.2.  CAUTION:    Maximum  designed  obstacle  clearance  is  based  on  your ability to maintain the course centerline;  you must use  your position orientation and your  judgment  to  determine  when  to  descend  while  attempting  to  intercept  the procedural track. 11.9.4.2.  Teardrop.  (Figure 11.12) Where a teardrop is depicted, do not descend from the  turn  altitude  until  you  are  established  on  the  inbound  segment  of  the  procedural track. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   193  Figure 11.12.  Procedure Track Approach (Teardrop).  11.10.  RNAV  (GPS)  Entry  Procedures  Via  the  Terminal  Arrival  Area  (TAA).  Entry  for RNAV (GPS) approaches is normally accomplished via the TAA.  Entry may be accomplished either via a NoPT routing, or via a course reversal maneuver if depicted. 11.10.1.  Objective.  The objective of the TAA is to provide a seamless transition from the en route  structure  to  the  terminal  environment  for  arriving  aircraft  equipped  with  Flight Management  System  (FMS)  and/or  Global  Positioning  System  (GPS)  navigational equipment.  The  TAA  will  not  be  found  on  all  RNAV  procedures,  particularly  in  areas  of heavy concentration of air traffic. When the TAA is published, it replaces the MSA for that approach procedure. 11.10.2.  The  TAA  structure.  The  RNAV  procedure  underlying  the  TAA  will  be  the  "T" design (also called the "Basic T"), or a modification of the "T." The "T" design incorporates from one to three IAFs; an intermediate fix (IF) that serves as a dual purpose IF (IAF); a final approach  fix  (FAF),  and  a  missed  approach  point  (MAP)  usually  located  at  the  runway   194  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 threshold  (see  Figure  11.13).  The  three  IAFs  are  normally  aligned  in  a  straight  line perpendicular to the intermediate course, which is an extension of the final course leading to the  runway,  forming  a  "T."  The  initial  segment  is  normally  from  3-6  NM  in  length;  the intermediate 5-7 NM, and the final segment 5 NM. Specific segment length may be varied to accommodate specific aircraft categories for which the procedure is designed. However, the published segment lengths will reflect  the highest  category of aircraft normally expected to use the procedure. Figure 11.13.  Terminal Arrival Area (TAA).  11.10.3.  Holding-in-Lieu Entry. A standard racetrack holding pattern may be provided at the center  IAF,  and if present  may be necessary for  course reversal  and for altitude adjustment for entry into the procedure.  In the latter case, the pattern provides an extended distance for the  descent  required  by  the  procedure.  Depiction  of  this  pattern  in  U.S.  Government publications will utilize the "hold-in-lieu-of-PT" holding pattern symbol. 11.10.4.  Entry  via  NoPT  routing.  The  published  procedure  will  be  annotated  to  indicate when  the  course  reversal  is  not  necessary  when  flying  within  a  particular  TAA  area;  e.g., "NoPT." Otherwise, the pilot is expected to execute the course reversal. The pilot may elect to use the course reversal pattern when it is not required by the procedure, but must inform air traffic control and receive clearance to do so. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   195  11.10.4.1.  Modified  ―T‖  designs.  The  "T"  design  may  be  modified  by  the  procedure designers  where  required  by  terrain  or  air  traffic  control  considerations  (Figure  11.14). For instance, the "T" design may appear more like a regularly or irregularly shaped "Y", or may even have one or both outboard IAFs eliminated resulting in an upside down "L" or  an  "I"  configuration.  Further,  the  leg  lengths  associated  with  the  outboard  IAFs  may differ. Figure 11.14.  Modified T Design.  11.10.4.1.1.  Parallel  Runway  ―T‖.    Another  modification  of  the  "T"  design  may  be found  at  airports  with  parallel  runway  configurations  (Figure  11.15).  Each  parallel runway may be served by its own "T" IAF, IF (IAF), and FAF combination, resulting in parallel final approach courses. Common IAFs may serve both runways; however, only  the  intermediate  and  final  approach  segments  for  the  landing  runway  will  be shown on the approach chart.   196  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 Figure 11.15.  Parallel T Design.  11.10.5.  TAA areas. The standard TAA consists of three areas defined by  the extension of the IAF legs and the intermediate segment course (Figure 11.16). These areas are called the straight-in,  left-base,  and  right-base  areas.  TAA  area  lateral  boundaries  are  identified  by magnetic courses TO the IF (IAF). The straight-in area can be further divided into pie-shaped sectors with the boundaries identified by magnetic courses TO the IF (IAF), and may contain stepdown  sections  defined  by  arcs  based  on  RNAV  distances  (DME  or  ATD)  from  the  IF (IAF). The right/left-base areas can only be subdivided using arcs based on RNAV distances from  the  IAFs  for  those  areas.  Minimum  MSL  altitudes  are  charted  within  each  of  these defined  areas/subdivisions that provide  at  least  1,000 feet  of obstacle clearance, or more as necessary in mountainous areas. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   197  Figure 11.16.  Standard TAA Area.  11.10.6.  Selecting  the  Entry  IF.  Prior  to  arriving  at  the  TAA  boundary,  the  pilot  should determine  which  area  of  the  TAA  the  aircraft  will  enter  by  selecting  the  IF  (IAF)  and determine the magnetic bearing TO the IF (IAF). That bearing should then be compared with  the  published  bearings  that  define  the  lateral  boundaries  of  the  TAA  areas.  This  is critical  when approaching the TAA near the  extended boundary  between  the left  and right-base areas, especially where these areas contain different minimum altitude requirements. 11.10.7.  Proceeding  Direct  to  IAF.    Pilots  entering  the  TAA  and  cleared  by  air  traffic control are expected to proceed directly to the IAF associated with that area of the TAA at the  altitude  depicted,  unless  otherwise  cleared  by  air  traffic  control.    If  in  doubt,  query ATC. Pilots entering the TAA with two-way radio communications failure must maintain the highest altitude assigned, expected, or filed until arriving at the appropriate IAF. 11.10.8.  Depiction of TAA Icons. Depiction of the TAA on U.S. Government charts will be through the use of icons located in the plan view outside the depiction of the actual approach procedure  (Figure  11.17).    Use  of  icons  is  necessary  to  avoid  obscuring  any  portion  of  the "T" procedure (altitudes, courses, minimum altitudes, etc.). The icon for each TAA area will be  located  and  oriented  on  the  plan  view  with  respect  to  the  direction  of  arrival  to  the approach  procedure,  and  will  show  all  TAA  minimum  altitudes  and  sector/radius subdivisions for that area. The IAF for each area of the TAA is included on the icon where it appears on the approach, to help the pilot orient the icon to the approach procedure. The IAF name and the distance of the TAA area boundary from the IAF are included on the outside arc of the TAA area icon. Examples here are shown with the TAA around the approach to aid pilots in visualizing how the TAA corresponds to the approach and should not be confused with the actual approach chart depiction.   198  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 Figure 11.17.  RNAV GPS Approach With TAA.  11.10.9.  Waypoint names.  Each waypoint on the "T", except the missed approach waypoint, is assigned a pronounceable 5-character name used in air traffic control communications, and which is found in the RNAV databases for the procedure. The missed approach waypoint is assigned a pronounceable name when it is not located at the runway threshold. 11.10.10.  Descents.  Once  cleared  to  fly  the  TAA,  pilots  are  expected  to  obey  minimum altitudes depicted within the TAA icons, unless instructed otherwise by air traffic control. In Figure 11.18, pilots within the left or right-base areas are expected to maintain a minimum altitude  of  6,000  feet  until  within  17  NM  of  the  associated  IAF.  After  crossing  the  17  NM arc,  descent  is  authorized  to  the  lower  charted  altitudes.  Pilots  approaching  from  the northwest  are  expected  to  maintain  a  minimum  altitude  of  6,000  feet,  and  when  within  22 NM of the IF (IAF), descend to a minimum altitude of 2,000 feet MSL until reaching the IF (IAF). AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   199  Figure 11.18.  Descents in TAA.  11.10.11.  Entry  procedures  for  Modified  TAAs.    Just  as  the  underlying  "T"  approach procedure may be modified in shape, the TAA may contain modifications to the defined area shapes and sizes. Some areas may even be eliminated, with other areas expanded as needed. Figure 11.19 is an example of a design limitation where a course reversal is necessary when approaching the IF (IAF) from certain directions due to the amount of turn required at the IF (IAF).  Design  criteria  require  a  course  reversal  whenever  this  turn  exceeds  120  degrees.  In this  generalized  example,  pilots  approaching  on  a  bearing  TO  the  IF  (IAF)  from  300° clockwise through 060° are expected to execute a course reversal. The term "NoPT" will be annotated on the boundary of the TAA icon for the other portion of the TAA.   200  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 Figure 11.19.  Entry Procedures for Modified TAAs.  11.10.12.  Entry  Procedures  for  one-base  TAAs.  Figure  11.20  depicts  another  TAA modification that pilots  may encounter.  In this generalized example, the right-base area has been  eliminated.  Pilots  operating  within  the  TAA  between  360°  clockwise  to  060°  bearing TO  the  IF  (IAF)  are  expected  to  execute  the  course  reversal  in  order  to  properly  align  the aircraft  for  entry  onto  the  intermediate  segment.  Aircraft  operating  in  all  other  areas  from 060°  clockwise  to  360°  degrees  bearing  TO  the  IF  (IAF)  need  not  perform  the  course reversal, and the term "NoPT" will be annotated on the TAA boundary of the icon in these areas. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   201  Figure 11.20.  Entry Procedures for One-Base TAAs. 11.10.13.  Feeder  Routes.  When  an  airway  does  not  cross  the  lateral  TAA  boundaries,  a feeder  route  will  be  established  to  provide  a  transition  from  the  en  route  structure  to  the appropriate IAF (Figure 11.21). Each feeder route will terminate at the TAA boundary, and will  be  aligned  along  a  path  pointing  to  the  associated  IAF.  Pilots  should  descend  to  the TAA altitude after crossing the TAA boundary and cleared by air traffic control.    202  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 Figure 11.21.  TAA with Feeders from an Airway.  11.11.  Helicopter  Only  Approaches  (Figure  11  22).    Helicopter  only  approaches  are identified by the term "COPTER", the type of facility producing final approach course guidance, and  a  numerical  identification  of  the  final  approach  course;  for  example,  COPTER  VOR  336. The  criteria  for  copter  only  approaches  are  based  on  the  unique  maneuvering  capability  of  the helicopter at airspeeds not exceeding 90 knots (EXCEPT 70 KIAS when on the final approach or missed approach segment and, if annotated, in holding. See AFI 11-202V3).  On the basis of this airspeed,  these  special  helicopter  only  approaches  may  be  used  with  the  helicopter  being considered  an  approach  Category  A  aircraft.        These  approaches  should  all  be  considered "straight-in"  and,  therefore,  a  visibility  only  approach  may  be  accomplished.    Once  the instrument approach has been accomplished, you should plan to touch down on the threshold of the procedure runway or helipad.  If there are several helipads, the designated instrument helipad will be identified using ―negative symbology‖. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   203  Figure 11.22.  Copter Only Approach.  11.11.1.  Low  Altitude  Approach.    In  a  low  altitude  approach,  a  maximum  400  feet  per nautical mile descent is normally planned.  In copter only approaches, however, the gradient may be as high as 800 feet per nautical mile. 11.11.2.  Short Procedures.  Looking at Figure 11.23, we can see an example of a very short procedure.  The initial approach fix is only .5 miles from the distance measuring equipment (DME) arc procedural track.  From the final approach fix (FAF) to the missed approach point (MAP)  is  2.3  miles.    While  this  approach  should  not  be  difficult  to  accomplish,  careful review could prevent you from becoming rushed during the maneuver.   204  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 Figure 11.23.  Short Final Approach.  11.11.3.  Point  In  Space.    While  the  point  in  space  approach  (Figure  11.24)  is  rare,  it  does illustrate how approach design takes advantage of helicopter capability.  This approach (see AFMAN 11-226 TERPS) places the helicopter up to 2,600 feet from the landing pad, and the pilot is expected to proceed visually, by ground reference, to the pad.  If planning to use this type  of  approach,  pay  careful  attention  to  weather  conditions  upon  arrival,  as  VMC conditions are required to maneuver. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   205  Figure 11.24.  Point in Space Approach.    206  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 Chapter 12 FINAL APPROACH 12.1.  Final  Approach  Guidance.  There are several types of final approach guidance.  For the purposes  of  this  chapter,  final  approach  guidance  will  be  categorized  as:    Non-radar,  Radar, Procedures  with  a  Visual  Component  (visual  approach,  contact  approach,  IAP  with  a  visual segment  and  charted  visual  chart  procedures),  and  Other  Specialized  Procedures  (converging approaches,  ILS  Precision  Runway  Monitor  (ILS/PRM),  Simultaneous  Offset  Instrument Approaches (SOIA), and Transponder Landing System (TLS).)  Once inside the final approach fix, one navigation receiver available to the pilot flying must remain tuned to and display the facility that provides final approach course guidance. 12.1.1.  Final  Approach  Components.    In  general,  final  approach  segments  consist  of  a  few basic  items:          The  final  approach  fix  (FAF),  stepdown  fixes,  visual  descent  point  (VDP),  missed  approach  point (MDA)  and  decision height/decision altitude (DH/DA).  The first four can be defined by a NAVAID, a waypoint, crossing radials of two NAVAIDs, or a radial and DME.  The optimum final approach course length is 5 miles but may be as long as 10 miles. (MAP),  minimum  descent  altitude 12.1.1.1.  The FAF is the point where the final approach begins and will be depicted by a Maltese cross in the profile view of the approach along with a recommended, minimum, or mandatory crossing altitude.  Normally, aircraft will cross the FAF at approach speed in  the  landing  configuration.    Certain  extenuating  circumstances  or  unique  aircraft procedures may cause procedural variations but the pilot should strive to have the aircraft on a stabilized profile by the FAF in order to mitigate spatial disorientation or deviations from the approach. 12.1.1.2.  Stepdown  Fixes.    Some  non-precision  approaches  may  have  one  or  more stepdown  fixes  between  the  FAF  and  the  MAP.    These  fixes  are  normally  included  to avoid  an  obstacle  inside  the  FAF.    Descent  below  stepdown  fix  altitude  is  limited  to aircraft capable of simultaneous reception of final approach course guidance and the stepdown fix.  Regardless of the type or number of navigation facilities used to define the stepdown  fix,  one  navigation  receiver  must  remain  tuned  to  and  display  final  approach course  guidance.    For  example,  aircraft  equipped  with  a  single  VOR  receiver  will  not descend below a stepdown fix altitude when two VOR radials define that fix. 12.1.1.3.  The  VDP  is  a  defined  point  on  the  final  approach  course  of  a  non-precision straight-in approach procedure from which a normal descent (approximately 3°) from the MDA  to  the  runway  touchdown  point  may  be  commenced,  provided  visual  reference with  the  runway  environment  is  established.    The  VDP  is  normally  identified  by  DME and is computed for the non-precision approach with the lowest MDA on the IAP.  A 75 MHz  marker  may  be  used  on  those  procedures  where  DME  cannot  be  implemented.  VDPs are not  a mandatory part of the procedure, but  are intended to  provide additional guidance  where  they  are  implemented.    A  visual  approach  slope  indicator  (VASI) lighting  system  is  normally  available  at  locations  where  VDPs  are  established.    Where VASI is installed, the VDP and VASI glide paths are normally coincident.  If VASI is not installed,  the  descent  is  computed  from  the  MDA  to  the  runway  threshold.    On  multi-AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   207  facility approaches, the depicted VDP will be for the lowest MDA published.  Therefore, on an approach with a higher MDA, the published VDP will not be correct and must be computed by the pilot.  No special technique is required to fly a procedure with a VDP; however,  to  be  assured  of  the  proper  obstacle  clearance,  the  pilot  should  not  descend below  the  MDA  before  reaching  the  VDP  and  acquiring  the  necessary  visual  reference with the runway environment.  The VDP is identified on the profile view of the approach chart by the symbol ―V‖ (Figure 12.1.) 12.1.1.3.1.  In  some  cases  a  published  VDP  may  be  absent  from  an  IAP  due  to  an obstacle that penetrates a 20:1 surface.   In addition, there was a period of time where the FAA did not place any emphasis on publishing VDPs on IAPs.  As a result, many IAPs  were designed without  published VDPs.  When an  IAP  is  published  without a VDP, there is currently no way for the pilot to know why.  WARNING:  While pilots should  calculate  a  VDP  if  one  is  not  published,  if  performing  a  non-precision approach  to  an  unfamiliar  field  at  night  (or  very  low  visibility)  without  a  published VDP,  and  no  visual  or  ―normal‖  electronic  glide  path  guidance  to  that  runway  is available, use extreme caution when departing the MDA, as there may be an obstacle penetrating the 20:1 surface.  Unless familiar with the airfield, if visibility is limited, consider remaining at the MDA even if the runway environment is in sight if terrain and obstacles along the final approach cannot be discerned.  See Chapter 15, Visual Glide Slope Indicators (VGSI) for more information on obstacles in the 20:1 surface. 12.1.1.3.2.  One  technique  for  calculating  a  VDP  is  to  divide  the  HAT  by  the glideslope in  degrees times 100.  For instance,  for a HAT of 450  feet  and a desired glideslope  to  the  runway  of  3  degrees,  divide  450  by  (3  x  100)  to  get  1.5  miles  to descend from the MDA to field elevation. 12.1.1.3.3.  On approaches with no distance reference (i.e. DME), another technique involves  making  a  calculation  based  on  final  approach  timing.    For  most  aircraft  in the  USAF  inventory,  about  10  percent  of  the  HAT  in  seconds  is  the  approximate amount  of  time  needed  to  descend  from  the  HAT  to  the  runway  on  a  normal glidepath.    Using  the  numbers  in  the  previous  example,  10  percent  of  the  450  foot HAT  would  put  the  VDP  45  seconds  prior  to  the  end  of  the  runway.    For  a  final approach that is six miles long and a groundspeed of 180 knots (3 miles per minute), total  time  from  FAF  to  the  runway  is  2  minutes.    Subtracting  45  seconds  from  2 minutes, the VDP would occur 1 minute and 15 seconds past the FAF. Figure 12.1.  Visual Descent Point (VDP).    208  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 12.1.1.4.  The  MAP  is  the  point  on  non-precision  approaches  where  an  aircraft  will execute  a  missed  approach  if  the  runway  environment  is  not  in  sight  or  a  safe  landing cannot  be  accomplished.    A  more  detailed  description  of  the  MAP  and  associated procedures is found in Chapter 14.  CAUTION: Depending on the location of the MAP, the descent from the MDA (once the runway environment is in sight) will often have to be  initiated  prior  to  reaching  the  MAP  in  order  to  execute  a  normal  (approximately  3°) descent to landing.  (See previous discussion on VDPs.)  On precision approaches there is no  MAP.    Rather,  the  pilot  executes  the  missed  approach  upon  reaching  the  Decision Altitude (DA). 12.1.2.  Flying the approach.  In general:  Avoid rapid descents on final by crossing the FAF at  the  published  altitude.    When  a  turn  is  required  over  the  FAF,  turn  immediately  and intercept  the  final  approach  course  to  ensure  that  obstruction  clearance  airspace  is  not exceeded.      Do  not  descend  to  the  minimum  descent  altitude  (MDA)  or  step  down  fix altitude until past the FAF (if published).  Note that when the FAF is the NAVAID for the approach,  a  course  change  of  up  to  30  degrees  may  be  required  and  the  approach  still  be considered a straight-in approach.  The Instrument Procedure Designer (TERPS) accounts for turns and designs the procedure to  ensure obstacle clearance with a descent commencing at the  FAF.    Arrive  at  the  MDA  with  enough  time  and  distance  remaining  to  identify  and descend to the runway environment at a normal rate for your aircraft (i.e. At or prior to the VDP.)    To  determine  the  approximate  initial  descent  rate  required  on  final  approach  by referring to  the VVI  chart in  the  IAP  books or by  using one of the  formulas for two of the most common glideslopes: 3° glideslope VVI     =     Groundspeed x 10  2  2½° glideslope VVI   =     Groundspeed x 10 - 200  2          Example: For a final approach groundspeed of 180 knots and a 3° glideslope:   VVI     =     180 x 10     =     900 fpm   2      12.1.2.1.  Timing  is  required  when  the  final  approach  does  not  terminate  at  a  published fix.    If  timing  is  required  to  identify  the  missed  approach  point,  begin  timing  when passing the FAF or  the starting point  designated in the timing block of the approach plate.  This point is usually the FAF but it may be a fix not co-located with the FAF such as a LOM, NDB, crossing radial, or DME fix.  Time and distance tables on the approach chart are based on groundspeed;  therefore, the existing wind and TAS must  be factored when computing final approach timing. 12.1.2.1.1.  If  timing  is  not  specifically  depicted  on  the  instrument  approach procedure, timing is not authorized as a means of identifying the MAP. 12.1.2.1.2.  If  both  timing  and  another  means  of  identifying  the  MAP  are  published (e.g.  DME),  timing  will  only  be  used  as  a  backup  unless  the  other  means  of  MAP identification is not operational or fails during the approach.    If the primary means AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   209  of identifying the MAP indicates arrival over the MAP, do not delay execution of the missed approach based on calculated timing. 12.1.2.2.  Runway  Environment.    Descent  below  MDA/DA/DH  is  not  authorized  until sufficient visual reference with the runway environment has been established and the aircraft is in position to execute a safe landing.  Thorough preflight planning will aid in locating  the  runway  environment  (lighting,  final  approach  displacement  from  runway, etc.)   The runway environment consists of one or more of the following elements: 12.1.2.2.1.  The  approach  light  system,  except  that  the  pilot  may  not  descend  below 100  feet  above  the  TDZE  using  the  approach  lights  as  a  reference  unless  the  red termination bars or the red side row bars are also visible and identifiable.  CAUTION: Most  approach  lighting  systems  serving  runways  where  no  electronic  glide  path guidance is available do not have red termination bars or red side row bars. 12.1.2.2.2.  The threshold, threshold markings or threshold lights. 12.1.2.2.3.  The runway end identifier lights. 12.1.2.2.4.  The  touchdown  zone,  touchdown  zone  markings,  or  touchdown  zone lights. 12.1.2.2.5.  The runway or runway markings. 12.1.2.2.6.  The runway lights. 12.1.2.2.7.  The visual approach slope indicator. 12.2.  Non-radar  Approaches.  Defined  as  approaches  that  do  not  require  radar  vectoring  or radar services on final and may or may not provide electronic glide path guidance.  Examples of non-radar  approaches  include  ILS,  VOR,  TAC,  NDB,  RNAV/GPS  and  MLS.    Procedures  that can be flown with or without glide path guidance using the same final approach course guidance include  ILS,  MLS,  and  RNAV/GPS.    (There  are  instances  of  all  of  these  types  of  approaches where  radar  is  required  to  identify  some  portion  of  the  approach  procedure,  which  will  be discussed in a later section.) 12.2.1.  ILS (Includes LOC, Localizer Back Course, Localizer Type Directional Aid (LDA), and Simplified Directional Facility (SDF). 12.2.1.1.  Required  Components.    In  the  United  States,  the  glide  slope,  localizer,  and outer marker are required components for an  ILS.   If the outer marker is inoperative or not installed, it may be replaced by DME, another NAVAID, a crossing radial, or radar, provided  these  substitutes  are  depicted  on  the  approach  plate  or  identified  by  NOTAM.  If the glide slope fails or is unavailable, the approach reverts to an approach without glide path guidance.  If the localizer fails, the procedure is not authorized.  If the OM (or at least one of its substitutes) is not available, then the procedure is not authorized. 12.2.1.2.  Transition to the ILS Localizer Course.  This is performed by using either radar vectors or a published approach procedure. 12.2.1.2.1.  Tune.    Tune  the  ILS  as  soon  as  practicable  during  the  transition,  and monitor the identifier during the entire approach. 12.2.1.2.1.1.  NOTE:    Airborne  marker  beacon  receivers  that  have  a  selective   210  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 sensitivity feature should always be operated in the ―Low‖ sensitivity position to ensure proper reception of the ILS marker beacons. 12.2.1.2.2.  Front  Course.    Set  the  published  localizer  front  course  in  the  course selector  window  prior  to  attempting  localizer  interception.  The  front  course  is  the proper course to set even when flying a back course approach. 12.2.1.2.3.  Orientation.  Where available, use other NAVAIDs (e.g. TACAN) to help identify  the  localizer  course  and  glide  slope  intercept  point.    (The  glide  slope  has  a usable range of 10 miles.)  WARNING:  It is possible to receive a false or erroneous glide slope signal with both the ground and air components of the glide slope system operating normally, normal ident, and no off flags or warnings, while established on the  localizer  course.    Where  available,  use  other  navigational  resources  to  confirm aircraft position on the approach. 12.2.1.3.  Localizer signal.  The localizer signal typically has a usable range of 18 miles within 10° of the course centerline unless otherwise stated on the IAP.   ATC may clear you to intercept the localizer course beyond 18 miles or the published limit, however, this practice  is  only  acceptable  when  the  aircraft  is  in  radar  contact  and  ATC  is  sharing responsibility for course guidance. 12.2.1.3.1.  CAUTION: The ILS/LOC approach must be discontinued if the localizer course  becomes  unreliable,  or  any  time  full-scale  deflection  of  the  CDI  occurs  on final approach.  Do not descend below localizer minimums if the aircraft is more than one dot (half scale) below or two dots (full scale) above the glide slope.  If the glide slope  is  recaptured  to  within  the  above  tolerance,  descent  may  be  continued  to DA/DH. 12.2.1.3.2.  NOTE:    If  making  an  autopilot  coupled  approach  or  landing,  use  the aircraft flight  manual  procedures for the category  of  ILS approach being conducted.  When  the  weather  is  below  800  foot  ceiling  and/or  2  miles  visibility,  vehicles  and aircraft are not authorized in or over the ILS critical area when an arriving aircraft is between the ILS final approach fix and the airport (except for aircraft that land, exit a runway,  depart  or  miss  approach).    However,  when  autopilot  coupled  or  auto  land operations  are  to  be  conducted,  and  the  weather  is  above  ceiling  800  feet  and/or visibility 2 miles, advise the ATC approach or tower controller as soon as practical but not later than the FAF.  This will allow time for the appropriate ILS critical area to  be  cleared  or  an  advisory  issued.    The  advisory  used  by  controllers  will  be:  "Localizer/glide  slope  signal  not  protected."    In  this  case  be  alert  for  unstable  or fluctuating  ILS  indications  that  may  prevent  an  autopilot-coupled  approach.    When aircraft equipment and crew qualification permit, the localizer and glide slope may be used for autopilot operations to the points specified in FLIP for each category of ILS approach, unless a restriction is published on the approach procedure. 12.2.1.3.3.  NOTE:    Some  types  of  tests  performed  by  ground  technicians  may produce ―erroneous‖ glide slope or course indications in the cockpit with no off flags.  Usually technicians carry out these tests in good weather with the affected runway not in use, however this is not always possible.  It is extremely important to monitor for a proper identifier and have current NOTAM information for the approach being flown.  You  must  also  listen  for  your  specific  approach  clearance  (i.e.  glide  slope  out  of AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   211  service) in addition to doing a proper altitude check at the glide slope intercept point.  Several  near  Controlled  Flight  Into  Terrain  (CFIT)  incidents  involving  commercial airliners highlight the seriousness of this problem. 12.2.1.4.  Descent.    When  on  the  localizer  course,  maintain  glide  slope  intercept/FAF altitude  (published  or  assigned)  until  intercepting  the  glide  slope/passing  the  FAF.  Published altitudes may be minimum, maximum, mandatory, or recommended altitudes. The  glide  slope  intercept  altitude  is  identified  by  a  lightning  bolt  ().    When  the  glide slope intercept altitude is a recommended altitude, you must only comply with other IAP altitudes  (FAF  altitude  for  example)  until  established  on  the  glide  slope.    On  some  ILS approaches a ―Glide slope Altitude at Outer Marker/FAF‖ will be published to allow the pilot  to  verify  proper  position  on  the  glideslope  when  crossing  the  Outer  Marker/FAF.  Do  not  descend  below  a  descent  restrictive  altitude  (minimum  or  mandatory)  unless established on final approach course. 12.2.1.5.  Steering Commands.  If using pitch and bank steering commands supplied by a flight  director system or FMS, monitor flight  path  and aircraft performance instruments to  ensure  the  desired  flight  path  is  being  flown  and  aircraft  performance  is  within acceptable limits.  Failure of the flight director computer (steering bars) may NOT always be  accompanied  by  the  appearance  of  warning  flags.    Steering  commands  must  be correlated with flight path (CDI/GSI) and aircraft performance instruments. 12.2.1.6.  Decision Height (DH).  DH is a height above touchdown referenced by a radar altimeter and is the height at which a decision must be made during a precision approach to  continue  the  approach  or  execute  a  missed  approach.    Do  not  descend  below  DH  if sufficient  visual  reference  with  the  runway  environment  is  not  established.    Obstacle clearance is provided to allow a momentary descent below DH while transitioning from the final approach to the missed approach.  Definition of runway environment is found in paragraph 12.1.2.2. 12.2.1.7.  LOC Procedures Without Glide Path Guidance. 12.2.1.7.1.  The middle marker may never be used as the sole means of identifying the  MAP.  The  middle  marker  may  assist  you  in  identifying  the  MAP  on  certain localizer approaches provided it is coincident with the published localizer MAP.  To determine  the  location  of  the  MAP,  compare  the  distance  from  the  FAF  to  MAP adjacent to the timing block.  It may not be the same point as depicted in the profile view.    If  the  MM  is  received  while  executing  such  an  approach,  and  your  primary indications  (DME  and/or  timing)  agree,  you  may  consider  yourself  at  the  MAP  and take appropriate action.   If  the middle marker is  the  only  way  to  identify  the  MAP (e.g.  no  timing  published  and  DME  out  of  service),  then  the  approach  is  not authorized. 12.2.1.7.2.  CAUTION: Approach procedures without glide path guidance (i.e. LOC) published in conjunction with an ILS cannot always clearly depict the FAF crossing altitude.    Careful  review  of  the  IAP  using  the  following  guidance  is  required.    The minimum  altitude  to  be  maintained  until  crossing  the  fix  following  the  glide  slope intercept  point  (normally  the  FAF  will  be  the  next  fix)  is  the  published  glide  slope intercept  altitude, altitude published at  that fix, or ATC assigned altitude.  For most   212  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 approaches without glide path  guidance the  glide slope intercept  altitude will be the minimum FAF crossing altitude. 12.2.1.7.3.  ―Back  Course‖  Localizer.    In  order  to  fly  a  back  course  localizer approach,  set  the  published  front  course  in  the  course  selector  window.    The  term "front course" refers to the inbound course depicted on the ILS/localizer approach for the opposite runway.  On the back course approach plate, the published front course is depicted in the feather as an outbound localizer course. 12.2.2.  MLS.    There  are  two  types  of  MLS  approaches:  non-computed  and  computed (Figures 12.2 and 12.3).  These approaches may be flown in the automatic mode (preferred) or the manual mode. MLS approaches are assumed to be non-computed unless noted on the approach  procedure.  Computed  MLS  approaches  will  have  the  following  note  in  the  plan view  of  the  approach  plate:  ―COMPUTED  APPROACH:  FOR  USE  BY  AIRCRAFT CAPABLE OF COMPUTING OFFSET RUNWAY CENTERLINE ONLY.‖ An example of a computed approach is provided in Figure 12.2. Figure 12.2.  Computed MLS Approach.  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   213  Figure 12.3.  Non-Computed MLS Approach at Boise, ID.  12.2.2.1.  Non-Computed (Figure 12.4). When flying a non-computed MLS approach, the azimuth signal steers your aircraft to the azimuth antenna just as approaches to traditional NAVAIDs such as VOR or TACAN do.  Consequently, it is important for you to know where  the  azimuth  antenna  is  located  on  the  airfield.  In  the  most  common  MLS installation, the antenna is located along the runway centerline between 1,000 and 1,500 feet from the departure end of the runway. When flying a non-computed approach to this type  of  installation,  your  final  approach  will  normally  be  lined  up  along  the  extended runway centerline.  Non-computed approaches should be flown using the default settings (AUTO and NON-COMP) of your MLS equipment. 12.2.2.1.1.  Offset  Installation.  In  some  installations,  the  azimuth  antenna  may  be installed  alongside  the  runway  (offset).  In  this  case,  when  flying  a  non-computed approach,  the  azimuth  guidance  will  not  steer  the  aircraft  to  the  runway  along  the extended runway centerline. In this particular configuration, the azimuth is rotated so that the azimuth signal guides the aircraft to the azimuth antenna along a course that is not parallel to the runway centerline. Review the approach plate carefully for notes   214  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 to that effect and for the arrow leading up to the aerodrome sketch to determine where to look for the runway at the missed approach point. 12.2.2.1.2.  WARNING:  If  you  are  flying  a  non-computed  MLS  approach,  and  you select  the  ―COMPUTED‖  approach  mode  on  your  MLS  equipment,  the  published approach  is  no  longer  valid  and  the  actual  approach  flown  will  no  longer  guarantee obstacle  clearance.  The  only  time  the  ―COMPUTED‖  mode  should  be  selected  is when the approach to be flown is a computed approach as indicated on the approach plate. 12.2.2.2.  Computed  (COMP)  (Figure  12.4).  A  computed  MLS  approach  steers  your aircraft  to  the  runway  along  a  course  aligned  with  the  extended  runway  centerline regardless of the location of the ground transmitters. Only aircraft having MLS receivers capable of using computed approach guidance can fly computed approaches. Computed approaches  should  be  flown  using  the  AUTO  and  COMP  settings  of  your  MLS equipment. 12.2.2.2.1.  WARNING:    In  order  to  fly  a  computed  MLS  approach,  all  system components (AZ, EL, and DME) must be operational. Failure of any component will result in aircraft receiver course and glide slope off/warning flags and loss of course information. 12.2.2.2.2.  WARNING:    If  flying  a  computed  MLS  approach  and  the  ―NON-COMPUTED‖ approach mode on the MLS is selected, the published approach is no longer  valid  and  the  actual  approach  flown  will  no  longer  guarantee  obstacle clearance. ―COMPUTED‖ mode should be selected when the approach to be flown is a computed approach as indicated in the plan view on the approach plate. 12.2.2.3.  Manual  vs.  Automatic  Mode.  Likewise,  if  you  switch  to  manual  mode  and change  either  the  approach  azimuth  or  glide  slope,  the  IAP  you  are  using  is  no  longer valid. 12.2.2.3.1.  Elevation  Angle.  An  elevation  angle  less  than  what  the  approach  was designed  for  may  not  provide  obstacle  clearance,  and  an  elevation  higher  than  the published angle mandates higher approach minima. 12.2.2.3.2.  Approach Azimuth. Changing the published approach azimuth in manual mode,  will  steer  the  aircraft  to  the  runway  along  a  different  course  than  published, which may take the aircraft outside of protected airspace. 12.2.2.3.3.  WARNING:  If  operating  in  manual  mode,  selecting  an  azimuth  and/or elevation  angle  different  from  the  published  procedure  invalidates  the  approach  and obstacle clearance. Follow MAJCOM directives regarding flying MLS approaches in the manual mode. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   215  Figure 12.4.  Non-Computed Mode/Computed Mode.  12.2.2.4.  Tune the MLS as soon as practicable during the transition to final and monitor the  MLS  identifier  during  the  entire  approach.  The  MLS  is  identified  by  a  four-letter identifier  always  beginning  with  the  letter  ―M.‖  The  four-letter  ident  is  transmitted  at least six times per minute by the approach azimuth (or back azimuth) ground equipment. Some aircraft installations do not include the audible identification feature;  in  this case, observing the correct 4-letter identifier on the aircraft‘s avionics display can identify the MLS. 12.2.2.5.  Azimuth  and  Glide  Slope  Selection.  The  MLS  receiver  will  automatically select  the  appropriate  azimuth  and  glide  slope  as  well  as  tune  the  TACAN  for  distance information. When operating in the manual mode, you may change the published azimuth and glide slope angle. 12.2.2.5.1.  WARNING:  If  operating  in  manual  mode  and  the  pilot  selects  a  course and/or glide slope different from the published procedure, the published approach is no  longer  valid  and  the  actual  approach  flown  will  no  longer  guarantee  obstacle clearance. 12.2.2.6.  Orientation. Use appropriate navigation facilities (for example: VOR, TACAN, GPS, or NDB) to remain position-oriented during the approach. 12.2.2.7.  If  using  a  flight  director,  it  should  be  configured  in  accordance  with instructions  in  the  aircraft  flight  manual  for  the  intercept  and  final  approach  modes  of operation.   216  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 12.2.2.7.1.  NOTE:  aircraft  may  only  fly  MMLS  approaches  with  the  proper equipment  as  determined  by  aircraft  flight  manual  and/or  MAJCOM.  All  other procedures to fly the approach will be the same as for conventional MLS. 12.2.2.7.2.  WARNING:  The  MLS  approach  must  be  discontinued  if  the  course becomes  unreliable,  or  any  time  full-scale  deflection  of  the  CDI  occurs  on  final approach. Do not descend below azimuth-only minimums if the aircraft is more than one dot (half scale) below or two dots (full scale) above the glide slope. If the glide slope is recaptured to within the above tolerances, descent may be continued to DH. 12.2.2.7.3.  NOTE:  If  making  an  autopilot-coupled  approach  or  landing,  follow  the aircraft  flight  manual  procedures.  When  autopilot  coupled  operations  are  to  be conducted, advise the ATC approach controller as soon as practical, but not later than the  FAF.  This  will  allow  time  for  the  appropriate  critical  area  to  be  cleared  or  an advisory issued. 12.2.2.8.  When  flying  the  final  approach  without  glide  path  guidance,  the  automatic mode  is  referred.    In  that  mode  the  receiver  will  automatically  select  the  appropriate azimuth  as  well  as  tune  the  TACAN  or  DME  for  distance  information.  If  operating  in manual mode, you must manually set the desired azimuth. 12.2.2.8.1.  NOTE: Computed MLS azimuth-only approaches may only be flown by aircraft  with  the  proper  equipment,  and  all  system  components  (azimuth,  elevation, and DME) must be operational. 12.2.2.8.2.  WARNING:    When  flying  an  MLS  azimuth-only  approach,  if  operating in  manual  mode  and  the  pilot  selects  an  azimuth  different  from  the  published procedure,  the  published  approach  is  no  longer  valid  and  the  actual  approach  flown will no longer guarantee obstacle clearance. 12.2.2.8.3.  WARNING:    If  you  are  flying  a non-computed approach  and  you select the ―COMPUTED‖ approach mode on your MLS equipment, the published approach is  no  longer  valid  and  the  actual  approach  flown  will  no  longer  guarantee  obstacle clearance.  The  only  time  the  ―COMPUTED‖  mode  should  be  selected  is  when  the approach to be flown is a computed approach. 12.2.2.8.4.  WARNING:  If you are flying a computed MLS approach, and you select the  ―NON-COMPUTED‖  approach  mode  on  your  MLS  equipment,  the  published approach  is  no  longer  valid  and  the  actual  approach  flown  will  no  longer  guarantee obstacle clearance. ―COMPUTED‖ mode should be selected when the approach to be flown is a computed approach as indicated on the approach plate. 12.2.2.9.  Flying the Approach. In general:  Avoid rapid descents on final by crossing the FAF at the published altitude.  When a turn is required over the FAF, turn immediately and intercept the final approach course to ensure that obstruction clearance airspace is not exceeded.  Non-precision approach procedures published in conjunction with an MLS do  not  always  clearly  depict  the  FAF  crossing  altitude.  The  minimum  altitude  to  be maintained until  crossing the fix following the  glide slope intercept  point (normally the FAF will be the next fix) is the published glide slope intercept altitude, altitude published at that fix, or ATC assigned altitude. For most non-precision approaches, the glide slope intercept  altitude  will  be  the  minimum  FAF  crossing  altitude.  Do  not  descend  to  the AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   217  minimum descent altitude (MDA) or step down fix altitude until you are established on course  and  past  the  FAF  (if  published).    Arrive  at  the  MDA  with  enough  time  and distance  remaining  to  identify  and  descend  to  the  runway  environment  at  a  normal  rate for your aircraft (i.e. At or prior to the VDP.) 12.2.2.9.1.  Timing  is  required  when  the  final  approach  does  not  terminate  at  a published  fix.    If  timing  is  required  to  identify  the  missed  approach  point,  begin timing when passing the FAF or the starting point designated in the timing block of the approach plate.  This point is usually the FAF but it may be a fix not co-located with the FAF such as a LOM, NDB, crossing radial, or DME fix.  Time and distance tables  on  the  approach  chart  are  based  on  groundspeed;  therefore,  the  existing  wind and TAS must be factored when  computing final  approach timing.   If  timing  is  not specifically  depicted  on  the  instrument  approach  procedure,  timing  is  not authorized as a means of identifying the MAP. 12.2.2.9.2.  VDP.  Arrive  at  MDA  (MDA  is  determined  by  the  barometric  altimeter) with enough time and distance remaining to identify runway environment and depart MDA from a normal visual descent point to touchdown at a rate normally used for a visual  approach  in  your  aircraft.  Descent  below  MDA  is  not  authorized  until sufficient visual reference with the runway environment has been established and the aircraft  is  in  a  position  to  execute  a  safe  landing.  Be  aware  that  the  final  approach course on a non-radar final  may vary  from  the runway heading as much as 30° and still be published as a straight-in approach. 12.2.2.10.  Inoperative System Components. 12.2.2.10.1.  In  non-computed  approaches,  if  the  azimuth  transmitter  is  inoperative, no  approach  is  authorized.    Additionally,  if  the  elevation  transmitter  is  inoperative, only  the  non-precision  (azimuth-only)  approach  is  authorized.    Ensure  you  can identify all required fixes with the MLS DME inoperative. 12.2.2.10.2.  In  computed  approaches.  All  components  must  be  fully  operational;  if any  component  is  not  available  (as  indicated  by  aircraft  receiver  course  and  glide slope  off/warning  flags  and  loss  of  course  information),  then  the  approach  is  not authorized. 12.2.3.  RNAV  (GPS),  GPS  and  RNP  SAAAR  Approach  Procedures.    A  Receiver Autonomous  Integrity  Monitor  (RAIM)  check  is  required  prior  to  flying  a  GPS  approach.  This  is  necessary  since  delays  of  up  to  two  hours  can  occur  before  an  erroneous  satellite transmission  can  be  detected  and  corrected  by  the  satellite  control  segment.    The  RAIM function  is  also  referred  to  as  fault  detection.  If  predictive  RAIM  is  not  available,  another type of navigation and approach system must be used, another destination selected, or the trip delayed until RAIM is predicted to be available on arrival.  A predictive RAIM check allows crews  to  plan  for  an  alternate  means  of  navigation  if  necessary.    If  a  RAIM  failure  occurs prior to the Final Approach Way Point (FAWP) or the approach mode does not activate prior to the FAWP, do not commence the approach and coordinate for an alternate clearance.  If a RAIM failure occurs after the FAWP, the receiver, based on equipage, is allowed to continue operating without an annunciation for up to 5 minutes to allow completion of the approach.  You must check the receiver operator manual to ensure  you have this capability.  If  you do   218  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 not have this capability and a RAIM flag/status annunciation appears after the FAWP, climb to the missed approach altitude, proceed to the MAWP and execute a missed approach. 12.2.3.1.  Flying the Approach Procedure 12.2.3.1.1.  Retrieving  the  procedure  from  the  Data  Base.  Do  not  fly  the  approach unless  it  can  be  retrieved  in  its  entirety  from  a  current  approved  database.    Cross check  data  base  waypoints  against  those  contained  on  the  published  approach  plate.  If discrepancies exist, do not fly the approach.  Exception:  The FAWP altitude may be  raised  above  that  shown  on  the  published  chart  in  order  to  ensure  adequate clearance at a step down fix. 12.2.3.1.1.1.  Note:  Manually  selecting  aircraft  bank  limiting  functions  may  reduce the  aircraft‘s  ability  to  maintain  its  desired  track  and  are  not  recommended.    Pilots should  recognize  manually  selectable  aircraft  bank-limiting  functions  might  reduce their ability to satisfy ATC path expectations, especially when executing large angle turns.  This should not be construed as a requirement to deviate from Airplane Flight Manual  procedures;  rather, pilots  should limit the selection of such functions  within accepted procedures. 12.2.3.1.2.  Prior to commencing the approach.  Determine which area of the TAA the aircraft will enter using bearing and distance to the IF (IAF).  Fly the full approach from an Initial Approach Waypoint (IAWP) or feeder fix unless specifically cleared otherwise.  Entry from other than an IAWP does not assure terrain clearance. 12.2.3.1.3.  Approach  Arming.      Some  receivers  automatically  arm  the  approach mode, while others require manual arming.  Arming the approach mode switches the aircraft  to  terminal  CDI  scaling  (+  1  NM).    If  the  IAWP  is  beyond  30NM  from  the airfield,  CDI  sensitivity  will  not  change  until  the  aircraft  is  within  30NM  of  the airport  reference  point.    Feeder  route  obstacle  clearance  is  predicated  on  terminal sensitivity and RAIM at the IAWP.  For manual systems, aircrews must ensure the approach is loaded prior to being established on any portion of the approach. 12.2.3.1.4.  Activating  the  approach.    When  within  2NM  of  the  FAWP  with  the approach  mode  armed,  the  receiver  will  automatically  initiate  a  RAIM  check,  and switch to approach sensitivity and RAIM (0.3NM).  Distance is provided based on the active  WP.    Pilots  must  cross  check  the  active  WP  identifier  to  ensure  situational awareness.   Some operations  (e.g., holding,  course reversal  maneuvers) may require manual intervention to either stop or resume automatic waypoint sequencing.   Pilots must ensure the receiver is sequenced to the appropriate waypoint, especially if not flying  the  full  procedure.  If  on  vectors  to  final,  ensure  that  receiver  is  set  IAW flight  manual  procedures.    Being  established  on  the  final  approach  course  prior  to the  initiation  of  the  sensitivity  change  at  2  NM  from  the  FAWP  will  aid  in  CDI interpretation  prior  to  descent  to  MDA/DA.    Also,  requesting  or  accepting  vectors that will cause the aircraft to intercept the final approach course within 2 NM of the FAWP is not recommended.  When receiving vectors to final, most receiver operating manuals suggest placing the receiver in the non-sequencing mode prior to the FAWP and manually setting the course.  This provides an extended final approach course in cases when vectors will place the aircraft outside any existing segment that is aligned with  the  runway.    Assigned  altitudes  must  be  maintained  until  established  on  a AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   219  published  segment  of  the  approach.    Required  altitudes  at  waypoints  outside  the FAWP or stepdown fixes must also be considered. 12.2.3.1.5.  Flying  point  to  point  on  the  approach  does  not  assure  compliance  with  the published  procedure.    The  proper  RAIM  sensitivity  will  not  be  available  and  the  CDI sensitivity will not automatically change to  +0.3 NM.  Manually setting  CDI sensitivity does not automatically change the RAIM sensitivity on some receivers. 12.2.3.1.6.  Loss of final approach guidance on an RNAV or GPS approach procedure is annunciated in a variety of ways depending on your particular avionics installation.  In some aircraft the CDI will center when the ―GPS  Integrity‖ light  illuminates and can give the illusion that you are on course.  Insure you are thoroughly familiar with failure  annunciations  for  your  aircraft  and  discontinue  the  approach  immediately  if course guidance is suspect. 12.2.3.2.  Final Approach 12.2.3.2.1.  Descent to MDA or DA.  Do not descend to MDA, DA, or step down fix altitude until the aircraft is established on course and past the FAF. 12.2.3.2.2.  Vertical  Navigation.      Unless  circling  from  the  approach,  VNAV guidance  should  be  followed  if  provided  by  aircraft  avionics  and  certified  for  use IAW  AFI  11-202V3. VNAV  guidance may be  used to  LNAV minimums; however, the  aircraft  must  level  off  prior  to  MDA  if  the  runway  environment  is  not  in  sight.   Due  to  the  temperature  and  pressure  altitude  effects,  USAF  crews  shall  not  use VNAV guidance below published MDA or DA. 12.2.3.2.3.  Step  Down  Fixes.  USAF  pilots  must  comply  with  all  stepdown  fixes depicted on the IAP.  VNAV guidance should provide clearance from all step down fix  altitudes,  however,  crews  must  monitor  altitude  at  all  step  down  fixes  to  ensure compliance. 12.2.3.2.4.  Runway Environment.  Do not descend below MDA/DA unless sufficient visual reference with the runway environment has been established and the aircraft is in position to execute a safe landing. 12.2.3.2.4.1.  Missed  Approach.    To  execute  a  missed  approach,  activate  the missed  approach  after  crossing  the  MAWP.    GPS  missed  approach  procedures require  pilot  action  to  sequence  from  the  MAWP  to  the  missed  approach procedure.  If the missed approach is not activated, the GPS receiver will display an  extension  of  the  inbound  final  approach  course,  and  displayed  distance  will increase  from  the  MAWP.    Do  not  activate  the  missed  approach  prior  to  the MAWP.    Once  the  missed  approach  is  activated,  CDI  sensitivity  is  set  to  1NM.  Missed approach routings in which the first track is via a course rather than direct to  the  next  waypoint  require  additional  action  from  the  pilot  to  set  the  course (consult your flight manual).  Do not turn off of the final approach course prior to the MAWP. 12.3.  Radar.  These  are  approaches  that  require  radar  services.    There  are  two  basic  types  of approaches: the precision approach (PAR) and the surveillance approach (ASR).  NOTE:  Fixes that require RADAR for identification are depicted with the word ―RADAR‖ appearing next to   220  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 the fix and the words ―RADAR REQUIRED‖ will appear on the approach plate.  Only ground-based radar, such as airport surveillance, precision, or air route surveillance radar, may be used to position the aircraft. 12.3.1.  The PAR provides the pilot  with  precise  course,  glideslope,  and range information; the ASR provides course and range information and is classified as a non-precision approach.  During an ASR and upon request, the controller will provide recommended altitudes on final to  the last  whole mile that  is  at  or  above the published MDA.  Recommended altitudes are computed from the start descent point to the runway threshold.  (At the MAP, the straight-in surveillance system approach error may be as much as 500 feet from the runway edges.) 12.3.2.  Lost Communications. 12.3.2.1.  Backup.    In  preparation  for  the  radar  approach,  select  a  backup  approach that is compatible with the existing weather and your aircraft where available.    If you experience  lost  communications,  you  are  automatically  cleared  to  fly  any  published approach unless the controller issues a lost communications approach. 12.3.2.2.  Contact.    Attempt  contact  with  the  controlling  agency  if  no  transmissions  are received for approximately: 12.3.2.2.1.  One minute while being vectored to final, 12.3.2.2.2.  Fifteen seconds while on final for an ASR approach, or 12.3.2.2.3.  Five seconds while on final for a PAR approach. 12.3.2.3.  Backup  Approach.    If  unable  to  reestablish  communications  and  unable  to maintain VFR, transition to your backup approach.  Intercept the approach at the nearest point that will allow a normal rate of descent and not compromise safety.  Maintain the last  assigned  altitude  or  the  minimum  safe/sector  altitude  (emergency  safe  altitude  if more  than  25  NM  from  the  facility),  whichever  is  higher,  until  established  on  a segment of the published approach. 12.3.2.4.  No Backup Approach.  If there are no backup approaches compatible with the weather or with your aircraft, advise the controller upon initial contact of your intentions in  the  event  of  lost  communications.        It  is  the  pilot's  responsibility  to  determine  the adequacy of any issued lost communications instructions. 12.3.3.  Voice Procedures.  The radar approach relies entirely on voice instructions from the radar  controller.    Repeat  all  headings,  altitudes  (departing  and  assigned),  and  altimeter settings  until  the  final  controller  advises  "do  not  acknowledge  further  transmissions." During  high-density  radar  operations,  keep  transmissions  brief  and  specific,  commensurate with safety of flight.  Never sacrifice aircraft control to acknowledge receipt of instructions. 12.3.4.  Transition  to  Final.    The  radar  controller  directs  heading  and  altitude  changes  as required to position the aircraft on final approach. 12.3.4.1.  Weather  information  issued  by  the  radar  controller  will  include  altimeter setting,  ceiling,  and  visibility.    The  controller  is  required  to  issue  ceiling  and  visibility only  when  the  ceiling  is  below  1,500  feet  (1,000  feet  at  civil  airports)  or  below  the highest circling minimum, whichever is greater, or if the visibility is less than 3 miles. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   221  12.3.4.2.  Field  Conditions.    The  controller  will  furnish  pertinent  information  that  the controller  considers  necessary  to  the  safe  operation  of  the  aircraft.    Request  additional information, as necessary, to make a safe approach. 12.3.4.3.  Orientation.    Use  available  navigation  aids  to  maintain  situational  awareness.  The controller will report aircraft position at least once before starting final approach. 12.3.5.  Accomplishing the Approach. 12.3.5.1.  ASR 12.3.5.1.1.  Controller.    The  controller  will  inform  the  pilot  of  the  runway  to  which the  approach  will  be  made,  the  straight-in  MDA  (if  a  straight-in  approach  is  being made),  the  MAP  location,  and  the  start  descent  point.    When  the  approach  will terminate  in  a  circling  approach,  furnish  the  controller  with  your  aircraft  category.  The controller will then issue the circling MDA.  Circling MDA for ASR approaches are found in the FLIP Terminal Book (the circling MDA found on the individual IAP refers only to non-radar approaches). 12.3.5.1.2.  Descent.    At  the  descent  point,  the  controller  will  advise  you  to  ‖begin descent.‖    If  a  descent  restriction  exists,  the  controller  will  announce  the  restriction altitude.  When the aircraft is past the altitude limiting point, the controller will advise you to continue descent.  The descent rate should be sufficient to allow the aircraft to arrive at the MDA in time to see the runway environment and make a normal descent to landing.   NOTE: Upon request, the controller will provide recommended altitudes on  final  to  the  last  whole  mile  that  is  at  or  above  the  published  MDA.    Due  to  the possible different locations of the MAP, recommended altitudes may position you at MDA  at  or  slightly  prior  to  the  MAP.   Consider this  in  relation  to  the  normal  VDP required for your aircraft. 12.3.5.1.3.  Runway Environment.  Arrive at the MDA with enough time and distance remaining to identify the runway environment and descend from MDA to touchdown at a rate normally used for a visual approach in your aircraft. 12.3.5.1.4.  Course  Guidance.    The  controller  will  issue  course  guidance  when required  and  will  give  range  information  each  mile  while  on  final  approach.    You may be instructed to report the runway in sight.  Approach guidance will be provided until  the  aircraft  is  over  the  MAP  unless  you  request  discontinuation  of  guidance.  The controller will inform you when you are at the MAP. 12.3.5.1.5.  MDA.    Fly  the  aircraft  at  or  above  MDA  until  arrival  at  the  MAP  or until  establishing  visual  contact  with  the  runway  environment.    If  the  runway environment  is  not  reported  in  sight,  missed  approach  instructions  will  be  given.  CAUTION:  Depending  upon  the  location  of  the  MAP,  the  descent  from  the  MDA (once  the  runway  environment  is  in  sight)  often  will  have  to  be  initiated  prior  to reaching the MAP to execute a normal (approximately 3°) descent to landing. 12.3.5.2.  PAR.  The PAR  is accomplished the same as the ASR with the exception that the  controller  will  also  provide  glidepath  guidance.    Approximately  10  to  30  seconds before  final  descent,  the  controller  will  advise  that  the  aircraft  is  approaching  the  glide path.    When  the  aircraft  reaches  the  point  where  final  descent  is  to  start,  the  controller   222  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 will state "begin descent."  The pilot should descend at a standard precision descent rate.  The controller will advise ―On, Above, Below, Well above, Well below glidepath, etc.‖  If  the  runway  environment  is  not  in  sight  at  DA/DH,  execute  the  appropriate  missed approach procedure. 12.3.5.2.1.  Approach  Guidance  Termination.    The  controller  will  cease  providing course and glide path guidance when:  The pilot reports the runway/approach lights in sight,  and  the  pilot  elects  to  proceed  visually    (e.g.  ―BRICK  10,  runway  in  sight, taking over visual.‖)  Note: A pilot‘s report of ―runway in sight‖ OR ―visual‖ alone does  not  constitute  a  request/advisement  to  proceed  visually  and  the  controller  will continue to provide course and glide path guidance. 12.3.5.2.1.1.  If  the  decision  is  made  to  discontinue  the  approach,  advise  the controller as soon as practical. 12.3.5.3.  No-Gyro  Approach  (Heading  Indicator  Inoperative).    If  the  heading  indicator should fail during flight, advise the radar controller and request a no-gyro approach.  The final approach may be either precision or surveillance. 12.3.5.3.1.  Perform  turns  during  the  transition  to  final  by  establishing  an  angle  of bank  on  the  ADI  that  will  approximate  a  standard  rate  turn,  not  to  exceed  30°.  Perform  turns  on  final  by  establishing  an  angle  of  bank  on  the  ADI  that  will approximate a half-standard rate turn.  NOTE:  Do not begin using half-standard rate turns  on  final  until  the  controller  tells  you.    The  controller  may  want  standard  rate turns  even  on  final  if  abnormal  conditions  exist  (i.e.,  strong  crosswinds,  turbulence, etc.)    If  unable  to  comply  with  these  turn  rates,  advise  the  controller.    Initiate  turns immediately  upon  hearing  the  words  "turn  right"  or  "turn  left."    Stop  the  turn  on receipt  of  the  words  "stop  turn."    Acknowledge  the  controller's  commands  to  start and stop turns until advised not to acknowledge further transmissions. 12.4.  Visual  Approach.  Visual  approaches  reduce  pilot/controller  workload  and  expedite traffic by shortening flight paths to the airport.  A visual approach is conducted on an IFR flight plan  and  authorizes  the  pilot  to  proceed  visually  and  clear  of  clouds  to  the  airport.    The  pilot must  have  either  the  airport  or  the  preceding  identified  aircraft  in  sight,  and  the  approach must be authorized and controlled by the appropriate ATC facility. 12.4.1.  Before  a  visual  approach  can  be  authorized,  the  airport  must  have  a  ceiling  at  or above  1,000  feet  and  visibility  3  miles  or  greater,  ATC  must  determine  that  it  will  be operationally beneficial and pilots must be able to proceed visually while remaining clear of clouds.    Additionally,  ATC  will  not  issue  clearance  until  the  pilot  has  the  airport  or  the preceding  aircraft  in  sight.  If  the  pilot  has  the  airport  in  sight  but  cannot  see  the  preceding aircraft,  ATC  may  still  clear  the  aircraft  for  a  visual  approach;  however,  ATC  retains  both aircraft separation and wake separation responsibility.  When visually following a preceding aircraft,  acceptance  of  the  visual  approach  clearance  constitutes  acceptance  of  pilot responsibility  for  maintaining  a  safe  approach  interval  and  adequate  wake  turbulence separation. 12.4.2.  A  Visual  Approach  is  an  IFR  Approach.    Although  you  are  cleared  for  a  ―visual‖ approach,  you  are  still  operating  under  IFR.    Do  not  cancel  your  IFR  clearance  when AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   223  cleared  for  a  visual  approach.    Be  aware  that  radar  service  is  automatically  terminated (without advising the pilot) when the pilot is instructed to change to advisory frequency. 12.4.3.  After being cleared for a visual approach, ATC expects you to proceed visually and clear of clouds to the airport in the most direct and safe manner to establish the aircraft on a normal straight-in final approach.  Clearance for a visual approach does not authorize you to do an overhead/VFR traffic pattern. 12.4.4.  Visual Approaches Have No Missed Approach Segment.  A visual approach is not an instrument approach procedure and therefore does not have a missed approach segment.  If a go-around is necessary for any reason, aircraft operating at controlled airports will be issued an  appropriate  advisory,  clearance,  or  instruction  by  the  tower.    At  uncontrolled  airports, aircraft are expected to remain clear of clouds and complete a landing as soon as possible.  If a  landing  cannot  be  accomplished,  the  aircraft  is  expected  to  remain  clear  of  clouds  and contact ATC as soon as possible for further clearance (separation from other IFR aircraft will be maintained under these circumstances). 12.4.5.  Pilot  Responsibilities  During  Visual  Approaches.    When  cleared  for  a  visual approach, the pilot has the following responsibilities: 12.4.5.1.  Advise ATC as soon as possible if a visual approach is not desired. 12.4.5.2.  Comply  with  controller's  instructions  for  vectors  toward  the  airport  of intended landing or to a visual position behind a preceding aircraft. 12.4.5.3.  After  being  cleared  for  a  visual  approach,  proceed  visually  and  clear  of clouds to the airport in the most direct and safe manner to establish the aircraft on a normal final approach.  You must have the airport or the preceding aircraft in sight. 12.4.5.4.  If instructed by ATC to follow another aircraft, notify the controller if you do not  see  it,  are  unable  to  maintain  visual  contact  with  it,  or  for  any  other  reason  you cannot accept the responsibility for visual separation under these conditions. 12.5.  Contact  Approach.  Pilots operating on an IFR flight plan, when clear of clouds with  at least  1-mile  flight  visibility  and  can  reasonably  expect  to  continue  to  the  destination  airport  in those conditions, may request ATC authorization for a contact approach. 12.5.1.  ATC  may  only  issue  clearance  for  a  contact  approach  under  the  following conditions: 12.5.1.1.  The pilot specifically requests the approach.  ATC cannot initiate this approach. 12.5.1.2.  The reported ground visibility at the destination airport is at least 1 SM. 12.5.1.3.  The  contact  approach  is  made  to  an  airport  having  a  standard  or  special instrument approach procedure. 12.5.1.3.1.  NOTE:  A contact approach is a procedure that may be used by a pilot in lieu of conducting a standard or special approach IAP to an airport.  It is not intended for use by a pilot to operate into an airport without a published and functioning IAP.  Nor is it intended for an aircraft to conduct an approach to one airport, and then in the clear, proceed to another airport.   224  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 12.5.2.  When executing a contact approach, the pilot assumes responsibility for obstruction clearance.  If radar service is being received, it will automatically terminate when the pilot is instructed to change to advisory frequency. 12.5.3.  Being  cleared  for  a  visual  or  contact  approach  does  not  authorize  the  pilot  to  fly  a 360° overhead traffic pattern.  An aircraft conducting an overhead maneuver is VFR and the instrument  flight  rules  (IFR)  flight  plan  is  canceled  when  the  aircraft  reaches  the  ―initial point.‖  Aircraft operating at an airport without a functioning control tower must initiate cancellation  of  the  IFR  flight  plan  prior  to  executing  the  overhead  maneuver  or  after landing. 12.6.  IAP with Visual Segment.  Some IAPs contain a published visual segment (Figure 12.5).    In general, when the distance from the MAP to the end of the runway exceeds 3SM, the words "fly visual " will appear in the profile view of the IAP.  A long dashed line in the profile view with  an  approximate  heading  and  distance  to  the  end  of  the  runway  will  be  depicted.    The depicted  ground  track  associated  with  the  visual  segment  should  be  flown  as  "DR"  course.  When  executing  the  visual  segment,  remain  clear  of  clouds  and  proceed  to  the  airport maintaining  visual  contact  with  the  ground.  Since  missed  approach  obstacle  clearance  is assured only if the missed approach is commenced at the published MAP or above the MDA, the pilot  should  have  preplanned  climbout  options  based  on  aircraft  performance  and  terrain features. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   225  Figure 12.5.  IAP with Visual Segment.  12.7.  Charted Visual Flight Procedures (CVFPs).  Charted Visual Flight Procedures (CVFPs) are published visual approaches where an aircraft on an IFR flight plan, operating in VMC and when authorized by air traffic control, may proceed to the destination airport under VFR via the route depicted on the CVFP (Figure 12.6).   When informed CVFPs are in use, the pilot  must advise the arrival controller on initial contact if unable to accept the CVFP. 12.7.1.  Characteristics.    CVFPs  are  established  for  noise  abatement  purposes  to  a  specific runway equipped with a visual or electronic vertical guidance system.  These procedures are used  only  in  a  radar  environment  at  airports  with  an  operating  control  tower.    The  CVFPs depict  prominent  landmarks,  courses,  and  altitudes  and  most  depict  some  NAVAID information for supplemental navigational guidance only. 12.7.2.  Altitudes.    Unless  indicating  a  Class  B  airspace  floor,  all  depicted  altitudes  are  for noise abatement purposes and are recommended only.  Pilots are not prohibited from flying other than recommended altitudes if operational requirements dictate. Weather minimums for CVFPs provide VFR cloud clearance at minimum vectoring altitudes.  Therefore, clearance for a CVFP is possible at MVA, which may be below the depicted altitudes.   226  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 12.7.3.  Clearance.  CVFPs usually begin within 20 miles from the airport.  When landmarks used for navigation are  not  visible at  night,  the  approach will be  annotated  "PROCEDURE NOT AUTHORIZED AT NIGHT." ATC will clear aircraft for a CVFP after the pilot reports sighting  a  charted  landmark  or  a  preceding  aircraft.    If  instructed  to  follow  a  preceding aircraft, pilots are responsible for maintaining a safe approach interval and wake turbulence separation.    Pilots  should  advise  ATC  if  at  any  point  they  are  unable  to  continue  an approach or lose sight of a preceding aircraft. 12.7.4.  Climb-outs.  CVFPs are not instrument approaches and do not have missed approach segments.  Missed approaches are handled as a go-around (IAW FLIP, GP).  The pilot should have preplanned climb-out options based on aircraft performance and terrain features. Figure 12.6.  Charted Visual Flight Procedure. 12.8.  Converging Approaches (Figure 12  7).  Converging approaches provide procedures for conducting  simultaneous  precision  instrument  approaches  (normally  ILS)  to  converging runways.  Converging runways are defined as runways having a 15° to 100° angle between them.   AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   227  In  simpler  terms,  if  the  runways  are  pointed  at  each  other  (extended  centerlines  intersect)  they are converging runways and procedures must be established to de-conflict possible simultaneous missed approaches. 12.8.1.  Procedures.    Converging  approaches  are  implemented  when  the  volume  and complexity  of  aircraft  operations  require  the  use  of  simultaneous  converging  instrument approaches.  These approaches are specifically designed to ensure traffic deconfliction during all phases of the arrival procedure.  Converging approaches are labeled as "converging" and ATC clearance must specify this type of approach.  Theoretically no operational hardships on users and control facilities will result from these operations. 12.8.2.  Differences.  There are two subtle differences found in converging approaches that a pilot must be aware of.  The missed approach departure instruction printed on the approach is the  procedure  the  controller  expects  to  be  flown  during  a  missed  approach  and  it  will  not normally  be  modified.    Although  missed  approach  departure  instructions  for  regular approaches  are  based  primarily  on  obstacle  clearance,  converging  approaches  also  include the  deconfliction  of  aircraft  on  the  other  converging  approach's  missed  approach.    This  is often done by moving the MAPs  of each converging approach further out from the runway and turning the aircraft away from each other. 12.8.3.  Missed Approach.  If on arrival at the MAP or DH/DA (or at any time thereafter) any  of  the  requirements  in  paragraph  12.1.2.2  are  not  met,  the  pilot  shall  immediately execute the appropriate missed approach procedure, ATC issued climb out instructions or other ATC clearance.   Delaying initiation of missed approach may result in traffic conflict with  other  aircraft.    For  this  reason,  anytime  a  pilot  continues  flight  beyond  the  MAP  the pilot must be highly confident of completing the landing since traffic deconfliction cannot be assured for missed approaches initiated beyond the MAP. 12.8.4.  Decision  Altitude.    Since  converging  approaches  must  provide  precision  approach guidance (normally ILS) the only way to adjust the missed approach point is to increase the decision  altitude.    Therefore,  normally  the  primary  difference  between  the  converging approach and the regular approach to the same runway will be the approach minimums and the  missed  approach  departure  instruction.    This  increase  in  approach  minimums  will  also result in an increase in the weather minimums required for the approach.   228  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 Figure 12.7.  Converging ILS Approach. 12.9.  ILS Precision Runway Monitor (ILS/PRM) Approaches (Figure 12  8).  12.9.1.  ILS/PRM approaches are authorized at  selected airports  where parallel  runways are separated by less than 4300 feet.  Specialized equipment, procedures and training for both air traffic controllers and pilots are required prior to conducting an ILS/PRM approach at these airports.    All  USAF aircrews must be cognizant  of the  requirements  for  operations at these airports  when  ILS/PRM  approaches  are  in  use.    ILS/PRM  approaches  allow  for  increased arrival  operations  at  airports  with  closely  spaced  parallel  runways.    All  pilots  flying  into these  airports  must  be  able  to  accept  a  clearance  for  the  ILS/PRM  approach  when  the services are offered or risk extensive delays. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   229  Figure 12.8.  ILS/PRM Approach.  12.9.2.  Simultaneous  close  parallel  ILS/PRM  approaches  are  published  on  a  separate Approach Procedure Chart titled ILS/PRM Rwy XXX (Simultaneous Close Parallel) (Figure 12.9). 12.9.3.  For an airport  to qualify for reduced lateral  separation between runways there must be ―high update radar‖ and associated high resolutions radar displays (Final Monitor Aids  - FMAs)  installed.  The  high  update  radar  provides  near  instantaneous  position  and  altitude information to the FMAs. Automated tracking software provides ―monitor controllers‖ with aircraft identification, position, altitude, and the predicted position ten seconds ahead, as well as visual and aural alerts to the controller.   This equipment, trained controllers, an enhanced communications capability that includes a secondary monitor frequency with tower override, and the ILS equipment collectively make up the ILS/PRM system. 12.9.3.1.  When  flying  appropriately  equipped  aircraft  and  trained  as  outlined  in AFI 11-202V3  and  MAJCOM  directives,  USAF  aircrews  are  authorized  to  fly  ILS/PRM approaches. 12.9.4.  Simultaneous  close  parallel  ILS/PRM  approaches  require  a  ―monitor  controller‖ using  the  PRM  system  be  assigned  to  each  runway  and  to  ensure  prescribed  separation standards are met. Standard  radar  and/or vertical separation is  used during turn-ons to  final approaches.  Vertical separation will continue until reaching an intermediate fix between ten and fifteen miles from the runway. From this point to the airport, aircraft may be at the same altitudes, be side by side, or pass traffic on the parallel final approach. Also from this point, or  just  outside,  a  block  of  airspace  has  been  established  as  a  buffer  between  the  final approach  courses.  This  airspace  is  2,000-foot  wide,  equal  distance  from  the  finals,  and  is called the No Transgression Zone (NTZ).  The NTZ is shown on the ―monitor controller‘s‖ display  and  as  the  name  implies,  if  planes  enter  or  approach  the  NTZ,  the  ―monitor controllers‖ issue instructions to correct the transgression.   230  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 12.9.5.  When conducting an ILS/PRM approach, the following procedures shall be used: 12.9.5.1.  ILS/PRM approach charts have an "Attention All Users Page" that must be referred  to  in  preparation  for  flying  this  approach.  (Figure  12.8)    The  Attention  All Users Page covers the following: 12.9.5.1.1.  Two operational VHF radios are required. 12.9.5.1.1.1.  Each  runway  will  have  two  frequencies,  the  primary  tower frequency  for  that  runway  and  a  monitor  frequency  discreet  to  that  runway.    To avoid  blocked  transmissions  during  a  breakout,  ATC  transmissions  will  be transmitted on both frequencies simultaneously. Transmissions from the ―monitor controller‖  will  over-ride  the  ―tower  controller‖  on  both  frequencies.  Pilots  will ONLY transmit on the primary tower frequency. It is important that pilots do not select  the  monitor  frequency  audio  until  instructed  to  contact  the  tower.  The volume  levels  should  be  set  about  the  same  on  both  radios  so  the  pilots  will  be able to hear transmissions on at least one frequency if the other is blocked. 12.9.5.1.2.  The approach must be briefed as an ILS/PRM approach IAW AIM. 12.9.5.1.2.1.  When the ATIS broadcast advises ILS/PRM approaches in progress, pilots  should  brief  to  fly  the  ILS/PRM  approach.    If  later  advised  to  expect  the ILS  approach,  the  ILS/PRM  chart  may  be  used  after  completing  the  following briefing items: 12.9.5.1.2.1.1.  Minimums and missed approach procedures are unchanged. 12.9.5.1.2.1.2.  Monitor frequency no longer required. 12.9.5.1.3.  If  unable  to  accept  an  ILS/PRM  approach,  notify  ATC  within  200NM of the landing airport  to coordinate alternative arrival procedures. 12.9.5.1.3.1.  NOTE:    Failure  to  pre-coordinate  a  non-ILS/PRM  arrival  during  a period  when  ILS/PRM  procedures  are  in  use  may  result  in  denial  of  approach clearance and/or  diversion to an alternate airport. 12.9.5.1.4.  All breakouts from the approach shall be hand flown.  Autopilots shall be disengaged when a breakout is directed. 12.9.5.1.4.1.  A ―blunder‖ is an unexpected turn by an aircraft already established on  the  localizer  toward  another  aircraft  on  an  adjacent  approach  course.    A ―breakout‖ is a technique used to direct aircraft out of the approach stream.  For close  parallel  operations,  a  breakout  is  used  to  direct  an  aircraft  away  from  a blundering aircraft while simultaneous operations are being conducted. 12.9.5.1.4.2.  Breakouts  differ  from  other  types  of  abandoned  approaches  in  that they can happen anywhere and unexpectedly. Pilots directed by ATC to break off an  approach  must  assume  that  an  aircraft  is  blundering  toward  them  and  a breakout must be initiated immediately. 12.9.5.1.4.2.1.  ATC  Directed  ―Breakouts‖.    ATC  directed  breakouts  will  be an air traffic controller instruction to turn and climb or descend.  Pilots must always initiate the breakout in response to an air traffic controller instruction.  Controllers  will  give  a  descending  breakout  only  when  there  is  no  other AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   231  reasonable  option  available,  but  in  no  case  will  the  descent  be  below  MVA which provides at least 1,000 feet required obstruction clearance. 12.9.5.1.4.2.2.  If  an  aircraft  enters  the  ―NO  TRANSGRESSION  ZONE‖ (NTZ),  the  controller  will  breakout  the  threatened  aircraft  on  the  adjacent approach.    The  phraseology  for  the  breakout  will  be:    ―TRAFFIC  ALERT‖, (aircraft  call  sign)  Turn  (left/right)  IMMEDIATELY,  HEADING  (degrees), CLIMB/DESCEND AND MAINTAIN (altitude).‖ 12.9.5.1.5.  Should  a  TCAS  resolution  advisory  (RA)  be  received,  the  pilot  shall immediately  respond  to  the  RA.  If  following  an  RA  requires  deviating  from  an ATC clearance, the pilot shall advise ATC as soon as practical.  While following an RA, comply with the turn portion of the ATC breakout instruction unless the pilot determines safety to be a factor. 12.9.5.1.5.1.  The  TCAS  provides  only  vertical  resolution  of  aircraft  conflicts, while  the  ATC  breakout  instruction  provides  both  vertical  and  horizontal guidance  for  conflict  resolutions.    Should  a  TCAS  RA  be  received,  the  pilot should immediately respond to the RA.  Adhering to these procedures assures the pilot that acceptable "breakout" separation margins will always be provided, even in the face of a normal procedural or system failure.   232  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 Figure 12.9.  ILS/PRM Approach with Attention All Users Page.  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   233   12.10.  Simultaneous Offset Instrument Approaches (SOIA).  Simultaneous Offset Instrument Approaches (SOIA) are procedures used to conduct simultaneous approaches to a set of parallel runways  using  a  straight-in  ILS  approach  to  one  runway  and  an  offset  LDA  with  glide  slope instrument  approach  to  the  other  runway.  (Figure  12.10).    The  parallel  runway  centerlines  are separated  by  less  than  3,000  feet,  but  are  at  least  750  feet  apart.    Controllers  monitor  the approaches with a PRM system using high update radar and high-resolution ATC radar displays. The procedures and system requirements for SOIA are identical with those used for simultaneous close  parallel  ILS/PRM  approaches  until  the  MAP--at  which  time  visual  separation  between aircraft  on  the  adjacent  approach  courses  must  be  applied.  An  understanding  of  the  previous section,  paragraph  12.9  is  essential  to  conduct  SOIA  operations.  When  flying  appropriately equipped  aircraft  and  trained  as  outlined  in  AFI  11-202V3  and  MAJCOM  directives,  USAF aircrews are authorized to fly SOIA approaches. 12.10.1.  In SOIA, the approach course separation (instead of the runway separation) meets established approach criteria.  A visual segment of the LDA approach is established between the  LDA  MAP  and  the  runway  threshold.    Aircraft  transition  in  visual  conditions  from  the   234  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 LDA course to align with the runway and be stabilized by 500 feet above ground level.  The pilot  of  the  trailing  aircraft  must  accept  responsibility  for  visual  separation  prior  to  the LDA aircraft reaching the LDA MAP, or a missed approach must be executed. 12.10.2.  Final  monitor  controllers  use  the  Precision  Runway  Monitor  system  to  ensure prescribed separation standards are met.  Procedures  and  communications  phraseology  are described  in  paragraph  12.9  ILS/PRM  Approaches.    PRM  monitoring  is  provided  to  the LDA  MAP  or  when  the  pilot  has  accepted  visual  separation  responsibility.  Final  monitor controllers will not notify pilots when radar monitoring is terminated. Figure 12.10.  SOIA Approaches.  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   235   12.11.  Transponder  Landing  Systems  (TLS).  Transponder  Landing  Systems  (TLS)  (Figure 12.11) are designed to provide approach guidance utilizing existing airborne ILS, localizer, glide slope,  and  transponder  equipment.    Ground  equipment  consists  of  a  transponder  interrogator, sensor  arrays  to  detect  lateral  and  vertical  position,  and  ILS  frequency  transmitters.    The  TLS detects the aircraft‘s position by interrogating its transponder.  It then broadcasts ILS frequency signals to guide the aircraft along the desired approach path.  The TLS ground equipment tracks one  aircraft,  based  on  its  transponder  code,  and  provides  correction  signals  to  course  and glidepath based on the position of the tracked aircraft.  Even though the TLS signal is received using  the  ILS  receiver,  no  fixed  course  or  glidepath  is  generated.    The  concept  of  operation  is very  similar  to  an  air  traffic  controller  providing  radar  vectors.    As  with  radar  vectors,  the guidance is only valid for the intended aircraft. 12.11.1.  TLS ground equipment provides approach guidance for only one aircraft at a time.   236  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 12.11.2.  When properly trained IAW MAJCOM directives, USAF aircrews are authorized to fly TLS approaches. 12.11.3.  TLS  signals  are  displayed  on  the  ILS  receiver  in  the  aircraft  the  same  as  a conventional ILS.  Cockpit set-up and course intercept procedures for a TLS approach are the same as a conventional ILS (i.e. set correct frequency, dial the published front course into the course select window, etc). 12.11.4.  Aircrews must receive a clearance for the TLS approach. 12.11.4.1.  WARNING:  If more than one aircraft is on final when another is conducting a TLS approach, the non-cleared aircraft will receive course and  glide path  information based on the position of the cleared aircraft. 12.11.5.  Aircrews  must  complete  required  coordination  with  TLS  ground  equipment operator prior to commencing the approach. 12.11.6.  Navigation fixes based on conventional ground-based radio NAVAIDS or GPS are provided  in  the  approach  procedure  to  allow  aircrews  to  verify  TLS  guidance.    Navigation equipment must be set-up to reference these fixes during the approach. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   237  Figure 12.11.  TLS Approach.    238  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 Chapter 13 LANDING FROM INSTRUMENT APPROACHES 13.1.  Planning  the  Approach  and  Landing.  A  successful  approach  and  landing  in  marginal weather  conditions  requires  considerable  planning,  which  should  begin  before  the  flight.  Checking the forecast weather, winds, NOTAMs, and runway conditions at your destination and alternate will normally help you determine the runway and type of approach that is likely to be used.    A  study  of  the  instrument  approach  procedure  for  the  destination  airport  will  show  the approach  as  well  as  the  runway  layout,  obstructions,  type  of  lighting  installed,  and  minimum data. 13.2.  Transitioning  From  Instrument  to  Visual  Flight  Conditions.  The  transition  from instrument  to  visual  flight  conditions  varies  with  each  approach.    Pilots  seldom  experience  a distinct transition from instrument to visual conditions during an approach in obscured weather.  Obscured conditions present you with a number of problems not encountered during an approach that is  either hooded or  has a  cloud  base ceiling.  At the point where the hood is  pulled or the aircraft breaks out below the ceiling, the visual cues used to control the aircraft are usually clear and distinct, and there is instantaneous recognition of the position of the aircraft in relation to the runway.    With  obscured  ceilings  or  partially  obscured  conditions,  the  reverse  is  usually  true; visual cues are indistinct and easily lost, and it is difficult to discern aircraft position laterally and vertically in relation to the runway.  Consider every factor that might have a bearing on the final stages  of  an  approach  and  landing.    The  visibility,  type  of  weather,  expected  visual  cues,  and even crew procedures and coordination are some of the tangibles requiring careful consideration.  Preparation  and  understanding  are  the  keys  that  will  make  the  transition  smooth  and  precise.  Only  through  a  thorough  understanding  of  the  weather  environment  and  how  it  affects  the availability and use of visual cues will  you be prepared to  transition  safely  and  routinely.  The following information deals with some of the conditions you may encounter during this phase of flight. 13.2.1.  Straight-In.    When  flying  a  straight-in  approach  in  VMC,  the  pilot  has  almost unlimited  peripheral  visual  cues  available  for  depth  perception,  vertical  positioning,  and motion  sensing.    Even  so,  varying  length  and  width  of  unfamiliar  runways  can  lead  to erroneous perception of aircraft height above the runway surface.  A relatively wide runway may  give the illusion that  the aircraft is  below a normal  glide path; conversely, a relatively narrow  runway  may  give  the  illusion  of  being  high.    With  an  awareness  of  these  illusions under  unlimited  visibility  conditions,  it  becomes  easy  to  appreciate  a  pilot's  problems  in  a landing  situation  in  which  the  approach  lights  and  runway  lights  are  the  only  visual  cues available. 13.2.2.  No Vertical Guidance.  Instrument approach lights do not provide adequate vertical guidance  to  the  pilot  during  low  visibility  instrument  approaches.    In  poor  visibility, especially when the runway surface is not visible, or in good visibility at night, there simply are  not  enough  visual  cues  available  to  adequately  determine  vertical  position  or  vertical motion.  Studies have shown that the sudden appearance of runway lights when the aircraft is at  or  near  minimums  in  conditions  of  limited  visibility  often  gives  the  pilot  the  illusion  of being high.  They have also shown that when the approach lights become visible, pilots tend AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   239  to abandon the established glide path, ignore their flight instruments and instead rely on the poor  visual  cues.    Another  similar  situation  occurs  when  a  pilot  flies  into  ground  fog  from above.    If  the  pilot  initially  sees  the  runway  or  approach  lights,  these  cues  will  tend  to disappear as the pilot enters the fog bank.  The loss of these visual cues will often induce the illusion or sensation of climbing.  These situations of  erroneous visual  cues convincing the pilot  that  the  aircraft  is  above  normal  glide  path  generally  result  in  a  pushover  reaction,  an increase in the rate of descent, and a short or hard landing. 13.2.3.  Descent  Rate.    Since  approach  lights  are  usually  sighted  close  to  the  ground  in limited  visibility,  an  increase  in  the  rate  of  descent  during  the  final  approach  when  the aircraft is  very  close to the  ground may  create  a  situation in  which sufficient lift cannot be generated to break the rate of descent when the pilot realizes he or she will land short. 13.2.4.  Crosscheck.    A  recommended  method  to  ensure  against  a  dangerously  high  rate  of descent and a short or hard landing is to maintain continuous crosscheck of the GSI or flight director and pay continuous attention to PAR controller instructions as well as VVI and ADI indications.    The  pilot  should  establish  predetermined  limitations  on  maximum  rates  of descent  for  the  aircraft  that  he  or  she  will  accept  when  landing  out  of  a  low  visibility approach.    Exceeding  these  limits  during  the  transition  to  landing  should  result  in  a  go-around and missed approach in the interest of aircraft and aircrew safety. 13.2.4.1.  Restrictions  to  Visibility.    There  are  many  phenomena,  such  as  rain,  smoke, snow,  and  haze,  which  may  restrict  visibility.    When  surface  visibility  restrictions  do exist  and  the  sky  or  clouds  are  totally  hidden  from  the  observer,  the  sky  is  considered totally  obscured  and  the  ceiling  is  the  vertical  visibility  from  the  ground.    If  you  are executing an approach in an obscured condition, you will not normally see the approach lights or runway condition as you pass the level of the obscured ceiling.  You should be able to  see the ground directly below;  however, the transition  from  instrument to  visual flight will occur at an altitude considerably lower than the reported vertical visibility.  In partially obscured conditions, vertical visibility is not reported since the ground observer can  see  the  sky  through  the  obscuration.    When  clouds  are  visible  with  a  partial obscuration, their heights and amounts are reported.  The amounts (in 8ths) of the sky or clouds obscured by a partial obscuration are included in  the remarks section of weather reports.    Although  this  may  help  clarify  the  reported  conditions  in  many  cases,  it  still does  not  provide  an  idea  of  the  height  at  which  visual  cues  will  be  sighted  or  the  slant range  visibility.    In  some  cases  the  partial  obscuration  can  be  associated  with  shallow patchy fog so you can expect to lose visual references once the fog condition is entered.  Also of concern is  the visual range at  which  you will be able to  discern  visual cues for runway alignment and flare.  Be aware that the runway visibility or runway visual range (RVR)  may  not  be  representative  of  the  range  at  which  you  will  sight  the  runway.    In fact, slant range visibility may be considerably less than the reported RVR.  Knowledge of these various factors will aid you in making a safe, smooth transition from instrument to visual flight. 13.2.4.1.1.  Shallow  Fog.    Fog  that  extends  no  more  than  200  feet  in  height  is considered shallow  fog  and is  normally  reported as  a partial obscuration.  Since the fog  may  be  patchy,  it  is  possible  that  the  visual  segment  may  vary  considerably during the approach and rollout.  RVR may not be representative of actual conditions in this situation if measured by transmissometer located in an area of good visibility.    240  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 One of the most serious problems with this type of fog stems from the abundance of cues available at the start of the approach.  You may see the approach lighting system and  possibly  even  some  of  the  runway  during  the  early  stages  of  the  approach.  However,  as  the  fog  level  is  entered,  most  or  all  the  cues  become  confused  and disoriented.    In  these  conditions,  you  should  not  rely  entirely  on  visual  cues  for guidance.    They  can  be  brought  into  the  crosscheck  to  confirm  position,  but instrument  flight  must  be  maintained  until  visual  cues  can  be  kept  in  view  and  the runway environment can provide sufficient references for alignment and flare. 13.2.4.1.2.  Deep  Fog.    Fog  that  extends  to  a  height  of  several  hundred  feet  usually forms a total obscuration.  You will not normally see cues during the early portion of an approach.  Most likely, you will pick up cues from only the last 1,000 feet of the approach  lighting  system.    From  a  US  standard  approach  lighting  system,  in  rapid succession you will probably see cues from the 1,000-foot roll bar, the last 1,000 feet of the centerline approach lights, red terminating bar, red wing lights, green threshold lights, and the high intensity runway edge lights.  If operating at night and the strobe lights are on, these may produce a blinding effect.  Care should be taken with the use of  landing  lights  as  they  also  may  cause  a  blinding  effect  at  night.    The  transition from an approach in a total obscuration involves the integration of visual cues within the  crosscheck  during  the  latter  portion  of  the  approach.    Again,  be  thoroughly familiar with the approach lighting system to develop the proper perspective between these cues and the runway environment. 13.2.4.1.3.  Fog Below Clouds.  This fog is usually reported as a partial obscuration below a cloud ceiling.  After penetrating through a ceiling, visibility usually increases when you descend below the cloud ceiling.  Therefore, the transition from instrument to visual flight is sharper, with more pronounced use of visual cues after passing the ceiling.  However, with fog below clouds all of the problems mentioned above with shallow  fog  and  deep  fog  may  be  found.    Night  approaches  may  produce  the sensation that the aircraft is high once the cloud base is passed.  You should continue on instruments, cross-checking visual cues to confirm runway alignment.  During the flare you may experience a sensation of descending below the surface of the runway.  This will be especially pronounced at facilities with 300-foot wide runways.  In either case, avoid abrupt or large attitude changes. 13.2.4.1.4.  Advection Fog.  Advection fog can present wind and turbulence problems not  normally  associated  with  other  types  of  fog.    Advection  fog  may  possess characteristics similar to shallow, deep, or cloud base fog.  It may be more difficult to maintain  precise  instrument  flight  because  of  turbulence.    The  characteristics  of advection fog will be related to the wind speed increases.  Wind greater than 15 knots usually lifts the fog and it forms a cloud base.  The best procedure is to be aware of the  conditions  that  might  be  encountered  and  to  integrate  visual  cues  within  the crosscheck  during  the  later  portion  of  the  approach.    Also  closely  monitor  airspeed because of the effects of turbulence and crosswinds. 13.2.4.1.5.  Ice Fog.  This type of fog is most common to the Arctic region; however, it can occur in other areas if the air temperature is below approximately 0° C (32° F).  It  consists  of  a  suspension  of  ice  crystals  in  the  air  and  is  more  common  around airports and cities.  Condensation nuclei caused by human activity often cause the fog AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   241  to  form.    When  there  is  little  or  no  wind,  it  is  possible  for  an  aircraft  to  generate enough fog during landing or takeoff to cover the runway and a portion of the field.  Depending  on  the  atmospheric  conditions,  ice  fogs  may  last  for  several  minutes  or days.  The piloting hazards and procedures are basically the same as with other fogs. 13.2.4.1.6.  Rain.  Approaches and the ensuing transition to visual flight can be very hazardous  since  moderate  to  heavy  rain  conditions  can  seriously  affect  the  use  of visual  cues.    Night  approaches  in  these  conditions  can  be  even  more  critical  as flashing strobes or runway end identifier lights may distract you.  Transition to visual flight  can  be  severely  hampered  by  the  inability  to  adequately  maintain  aircraft control and interpret the instruments as a result of gusty or turbulent conditions.  The moderate  or  heavy  rain  conditions  can  also  render  the  rain  removal  equipment ineffective, causing obscuration of visual cues at a critical time during the transition.  In  these  conditions,  be  prepared  for  an  alternate  course  of  action  and  act  without hesitation to prevent the development of an unsafe situation. 13.2.4.1.7.  Snow.    Blowing  snow  is  accompanied  by  many  of  the  same  hazards  as rain, such as turbulence, difficulties in reading the flight instruments, obscured visual cues, and aircraft control problems.  Of special interest will be a lack of visual cues for  runway  identification  for  the  visual  portion  of  the  approach.    The  approach  and runway  lights  will  provide  some  identification;  however,  runway  markings  and  the contrast  with  relation  to  its  surroundings  may  be  lost  in  the  whiteness.    Therefore, depth  perception  may  be  difficult,  requiring  more  emphasis  on  instruments  for attitude  control.    It  is  extremely  important  to  avoid  large  attitude  changes  during approaches in snow. 13.2.4.2.  Visual Cues. 13.2.4.2.1.  Runway  Contact  Point.    Approach  lights,  runway  markings,  lights,  and contrasts are the primary sources of visual cues.  At some facilities, touchdown zone and  centerline  lights  may  also  be  available.    Become  familiar  with  the  lighting  and marking patterns at your destination and correlate them with the weather so you will be prepared to transition to visual flight.  In minimum visibility conditions, the visual cues and references for  flare and  runway  alignment  are extremely limited compared to  the  normal  references  used  during  a  visual  approach.    Therefore,  the  aircraft's projected  runway  contact  point  may  not  be  within  your  visual  segment  until considerably below published minimums. 13.2.4.2.1.1.  WARNING:  Any  abrupt  attitude  changes  to  attempt  to  bring  the projected touchdown point into your visual segment may produce high sink rates and  thrust  or  lift  problems  at  a  critical  time.    Those  so-called  duck-under maneuvers must be avoided during the low visibility approach. 13.2.4.2.2.  Duck-under.    Another  potential  duck-under  situation  occurs  when  you attempt to land within the first 500 to 1,000 feet of the runway after breaking out of an  overcast  condition.    In  this  case,  you  may  attempt  to  establish  a  visual  profile similar to the one you use most often.  Establishing the visual profile usually involves reducing power and changing attitude to aim the aircraft at some spot short of the end of  the  runway.    In  this  maneuver  you  may  attempt  to  use  as  much  of  the  available runway as possible because of a short runway or due to poor braking conditions.  The   242  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 duck-under is not recommended since high sink rates and poor thrust/lift relationships can  develop  which  may  cause  undershoots  or  hard  landings.    Base  your  landing decision  upon  the  normal  touchdown  point  from  the  instrument  approach,  and  if stopping distances are insufficient, proceed to an alternate. Figure 13.1.  Downward Vision Angle.  13.2.4.3.  Downward Vision Angle (Figure 13.1).  There is an area hidden by the nose of an  aircraft  that  cannot  be  seen  from  the  cockpit.    The  downward  vision  line  from  the pilot's eye projected over the nose of the aircraft forms an angle with the horizontal vision line.  This angle is called the "downward vision angle."  An aircraft with a 14° downward vision  angle  100  feet  above  the  surface  will  conceal  about  400  feet  beneath  its  nose.  Consider  an  approach  in  1,600-foot  visibility.    This  means  your  visual  segment  at  100-foot  elevation  with  a  14°  downward  vision  will  be  reduced  to  about  1,200  feet.    Other factors, such as a nose-high pitch attitude and a slant range visibility less than the RVR, can further reduce your visual segment. 13.2.4.4.  Pilot Reaction Time.  At 100-foot elevation and a 3° glide slope, an aircraft is approximately 1,900 feet from the runway point of intercept (RPI).  If your aircraft's final approach  speed  is  130  knots  (215  feet  per  second),  you  have  about  9  seconds  to  bring visual cues into the crosscheck, ascertain lateral and vertical position, determine a visual flight path, and establish appropriate corrections.  More than likely, 3 to 4 seconds will be spent integrating visual cues before making a necessary control input.  By this time, the aircraft will be 600 to 800 feet closer to the RPI, 40 to 60 feet lower, and possibly well into  the  flare.    Therefore,  it  is  absolutely  essential  to  be  prepared  to  use  visual  cues properly and with discretion during the final stages of a low visibility approach.  Prior to total  reliance  on  visual  information,  confirm  that  the  instrument  indications  support  the visual perspective. 13.2.4.5.  Crew Procedures. 13.2.4.5.1.  Pilot Monitoring (PM).  A PM can assist the pilot flying (PF) in a number of  ways.    The  PM  can  fly  the  approach,  control  airspeed,  be  responsible  for AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   243  communications, direct the checklist, perform the missed approach, establish aircraft configurations,  or  perform  any  other  duties  assigned  by  the  PF.    However,  the  PM must  understand  exactly  what  those  duties  and  responsibilities  are  before  the approach. 13.2.4.5.2.  Technique One.  One technique that has proven quite successful has been to  allow  highly  qualified  copilots  to  fly  the  approach,  while  the  pilot  makes  the decision to continue or go-around at DH.  The PM assumes control if a landing is to be  made;  if  not,  the  copilot  executes  the  go-around.    This  procedure  puts  fewer burdens on the pilot,  allowing more time to  obtain information  from  the visual cues for  landing.    If  the  approach  is  unsatisfactory  or  insufficient  visual  references  are available  to  continue  the  approach  at  DA/DH,  the  copilot,  since  the  aircraft  is  on instruments,  is  prepared  to  execute  a  missed  approach  on  command.    If  the  pilot executes the approach, the copilot may be allowed to control power or airspeed until DA/DH where the pilot assumes control for the landing or missed approach. 13.2.4.5.3.  Technique  Two.    Another  technique  is  to  have  the  PM  the  approach continue to monitor flight instruments from DA/DH or minimum descent altitude to touchdown and notify the PF the approach of excessive deviations in rates of descent, glide  slope,  course,  or  airspeed.    This  technique  will  help  detect  duck-under maneuvers and will prevent both pilots from being deceived by a visual illusion that may be present. 13.2.4.5.4.  Technique  Three.    A  final  technique  is  to  have  the  autopilot  fly  the approach to the MDA/DA/DH and then have the PF assume control to either land or execute  the  go-around  as  required.    This  technique  can  be  quite  helpful  especially after a long duty day and/or with instrument conditions. 13.3.  Approach Lighting Systems. 13.3.1.  Types of Approach Lighting Systems. 13.3.1.1.  Visual Aids.  Approach lighting systems are visual aids used during instrument conditions  to  supplement  the  guidance  information  of  electronic  aids  such  as  VOR, TACAN,  PAR,  and  ILS.    The  approach  lights  are  designated  high  intensity  (the  basic type of installation) and medium intensity, according to candlepower output. 13.3.1.2.  Adjustment.    Most  runway  and  approach  light  systems  allow  the  tower controller  to  adjust  the  lamp  brightness  for  different  visibility  conditions,  or  at  a  pilot's request.    The  extreme  brilliance  of  high  intensity  lights  penetrates  fog,  smoke, precipitation, etc., but may cause excessive glare under some conditions. 13.3.1.3.  Depiction.  The approach lighting systems now in use, along with their standard lengths, appear in the FIH. 13.3.1.4.  Pilot Activation.  Some airports have installed airport lighting systems that can be activated by the pilot "keying the microphone" on selected frequencies.  Information concerning these systems can be found in the FIH and Terminal FLIP. 13.3.2.  Runway End Identifier Lights (REIL).  Runway end identifier lights are installed at many airfields to help identify the approach end of the runway.  The system consists of two synchronized  flashing  lights,  one  of  which  is  located  laterally  on  each  side  of  the  runway   244  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 threshold  facing  the  approach  area.    They  are  effective  for  identifying  a  runway  that  lacks contrast  with  the  surrounding  terrain  or  which  is  surrounded  by  other  lighting,  and  for approaches during reduced visibility. 13.3.3.  Visual Glide Slope Indicators (VGSI). 13.3.3.1.  There are many different types of visual glide slope indicators in use, many in conjunction  with  instrument  approach  procedures.    They  provide  visual  glide  path guidance  from  the  instrument  approach  minimums  to  a  point  on  the  runway  and  can provide  assistance  in  the  transition  from  instrument  to  visual  flight.    Configurations  are depicted in the FIH. 13.3.3.1.1.  Depending upon which approach is flown, the visual glide path indicator may not guide the aircraft to the same point on the runway as the instrument approach being  flown.    This  is  depicted  on  many  approach  procedures  with  a  note  such  as, ―PAPI and ILS RPI not coincident.‖ This is common at airports with frequent jumbo-jet operations (C-5, 747, 777, etc).  The VGSI at these airports is frequently adjusted to compensate for the greater vertical distance between the ground and the cockpit in these  large  aircraft.    A  smaller  aircraft  (KC-135,  C-130,  fighter,  etc)  that  follows these  VGSI  indications  to  touchdown  will  touchdown  beyond  their  normal touchdown point. 13.4.  Runway Lighting Systems  (Figure  13  2).  Two basic runway lighting systems are used to  aid  the  pilot  in  defining  the  usable  landing  area  of  the  runway.    These  systems  are  Runway Edge  Lights  and  Runway  Centerline  and  Touchdown  Zone  Lights.    For  discussion  of  airport markings  and  signs  used  during  ground  operations,  see  AFI  11-218,  Aircraft  Operations  and Movement on the Ground. 13.4.1.  Runway Edge Lighting.  The runway edge lighting system is a configuration of lights that defines the limits of the usable landing area.  The lateral limits are defined by a row of white lights on either side of the runway.  The longitudinal limits are defined at each end by the  threshold  lighting  configuration.    This  configuration  includes  threshold  lights,  a  pre-threshold light  bar, and  a terminating bar.  The threshold lights  emit  green light  toward the approach end of the runway and red light toward the rollout end of the runway. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   245  Figure 13.2.  Runway Lighting Systems.  13.4.1.1.  HIRL.  The High Intensity Runway Lighting (HIRL) system is the basic type of installation used by the Air Force.  These elevated bi-directional lights, which extend the length of the runway, emit a white light the entire length of the runway at some military fields.    Most  military  and  all  civil  field  HIRLs  also  emit  a  white  light  except  in  the caution zone, which is the last 2,000 feet (610m) of an instrument runway or one-half the runway length, whichever is less.  The lights in the caution zone emit a yellow light in the direction of the approach end and white light in the opposite direction.  The yellow lights are  intended  for  rollout  information  after  landing  and  are  sometimes  used  in  place  of runway remaining markers. 13.4.1.2.  MIRL.    The  Medium  Intensity  Runway  Lighting  (MIRL)  system,  which consists of elevated, omni-directional lights, may be installed on runways that are not to be used under IMC due to impaired clearance, short length, or other factors. 13.4.2.  Runway  Centerline  and  Touchdown  Zone  Lighting.    The  runway  centerline  and touchdown  zone  lighting  systems  are  designed  to  facilitate  landings,  rollouts,  and  takeoffs under  adverse  day  and  night  low  visibility  conditions.    The  touchdown  zone  lights,  which define  the  touchdown  area,  are  primarily  a  landing  aid  while  the  centerline  lights  are  most effective for rollout and takeoff. 13.4.2.1.  Touchdown  Zone  Lighting.    The  touchdown  zone  lighting  system  consists  of two  rows  of  high  intensity  light  bars  arranged  on  either  side  of  the  runway  centerline.  Each bar consists of three unidirectional white lights toward the approach area.  The two rows of light bars are 3,000 feet long and extend from the threshold of the runway toward the rollout end of the runway. 13.4.2.2.  Runway  Centerline  Lighting.    The  runway  centerline  lighting  system  is  a straight  line  of  lights  located  along  the  runway  centerline.    The  system  starts  75  feet (23m) from the threshold and  extends down the  runway to within 75  feet of the rollout end of the runway.  The last 3,000 feet  are color coded for landing  rollout information.    246  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 The last 3,000-foot to 1,000-foot section displays alternate red and white lights, while the last 1,000-foot section displays all red lights. 13.5.  Runway  Markings.  Runway  markings  are  designed  to  make  the  landing  area  more conspicuous and to add a third dimension for night and low visibility operations.  For discussion of airport and runway markings, see AFI 11-218. 13.6.  Circling Approaches. 13.6.1.  General  Procedures.    Circling  to  land  is  a  visual  flight  maneuver.    When  the instrument  approach  is  completed,  it  is  used  to  align  the  aircraft  with  the  landing  runway.  The  circling  MDA  and  weather  minima  to  be  used  are  those  for  the  runway  to  which  the instrument approach is flown (this is not always the landing runway).  The circling minima listed  on  IAPs  apply  to  all  approach  types  on  the  IAP  (RNAV  (GPS),  ILS,  LOC,  VOR, TACAN,  etc.).    However,  since  the  MAP  associated  with  the  precision  approach  is determined  by  the  pilot  in  terms  of  a  DH  and  not  a  specific  point  along  the  final  approach course, it becomes difficult to ascertain when to discontinue the approach if visual conditions are  not  encountered.    Therefore,  pilots  are  cautioned  to  ensure  the  aircraft  is  within  the appropriate  circling  radius  before  abandoning  the  precision  glideslope,  if  planning  to  circle from a precision final approach. 13.6.1.1.  Circling from RNAV/GPS Approaches. Circling may be accomplished from an RNAV (GPS) approach if circling minimums are published.  However, depending on the type  of  circling  maneuver  required,  following  RNAV  (GPS)  vertical  guidance  to  the circling  MDA  may  result  in  visually  acquiring  the  airport  environment  too  late  to accomplish a safe circling maneuver.  Pilots must ensure they remain within the required obstacle  clearance  radius  and  maintain  situational  awareness,  especially  in  reduced visibility.    In  reduced  visibility,  pilots  must  maintain  situational  awareness  and  insure they  remain  within  the  required  obstacle  clearance  radius.    If  there  is  any  doubt  as  to maintaining  required  distance,  or  a  loss  of  situational  awareness,  accomplish  the missed approach and request an alternate approach. 13.6.2.  Instructions.    If  the  controller  has  a  requirement  to  specify  the  direction  of  the circling maneuver in relation to the airport or runway, the controller will issue instructions in the following manner: ―Circle (direction given as one of eight cardinal compass points) of the airport/runway  for  a  right/left  base/downwind  to  runway  (number).‖    For  example,  ―Circle west of the airport for a right base to runway one eight.‖ 13.6.2.1.  NOTE:  Obstruction  clearance  areas  are  determined  by  aircraft  category.  Maneuver  the  aircraft  to  remain  within  the  circling  area  for  your  aircraft  category  (see AFMAN  11-217V3  for  radii  of  circling  approaches).    If  it  is  necessary  to  maneuver  at speeds  in  excess  of  the  upper  limit  of  the  speed  range  authorized  for  your  aircraft‘s category, use the landing minima for the category appropriate to the maneuvering speed.  When  you request  circling MDA from  the  controller for a  circling ASR  approach, state your aircraft category. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   247  Figure 13.3.  The Circling Approach. 13.6.3.  Accomplishing the Approach (Figure 13.3).  13.6.3.1.  Descent.  After descending to circling minimum descent altitude and when the airport  environment  is  in  sight,  determine  if  the  ceiling  and  visibility  are  sufficient  for performing  the  circling  maneuver.    The  airport  environment  is  considered  the  runways, its lights and markings, taxiways, hangars, and other buildings associated with the airport.  (Since the MDA is a minimum altitude, a higher altitude may be maintained throughout the maneuver.) 13.6.3.2.  Pattern.  Choose a pattern that best suits the situation.  Maneuver the aircraft to a position that allows you to keep as much of the airport environment in sight as possible.  Consider making your turn to final into the wind if this maneuvering allows you to also keep  the  airport  environment  in  sight.    You  may  make  either  left  or  right  turns  to  final unless  you  are  directed  by  the  controlling  agency  to  turn  in  a  specific  direction  or  are limited by restrictions on the approach chart or IFR Supplement. 13.6.3.3.  Weather  --  High  Ceiling/Good  Visibility.    If  weather  permits,  fly  the  circling approach  at  an  altitude  higher  than  the  circling  MDA,  up  to  your  normal  VFR  traffic   248  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 pattern altitude.  This allows the maneuver to be flown with a more familiar perspective and better visual cues.  Do not descend below circling MDA until in a position to place the aircraft on a normal glide path to the landing runway.  (In order to prepare pilots for the  worst  situation  fly  practice  circling  approaches  at  the  circling  MDA  if  feasible  and conditions permit.) 13.6.3.4.  Weather  --  Low  Ceiling/Restricted  visibility.  If  weather  does  not  permit circling above the MDA, do not descend below circling MDA until the aircraft is in  a position to execute a normal landing. Descend from the MDA as necessary to place the aircraft on a normal glide path to the landing runway. 13.6.3.5.  Missed  Approach.  If  there  is  any  doubt  whether  the  aircraft  can  be  safely maneuvered to touchdown, execute the missed approach. 13.6.3.5.1.  CAUTION:  Be aware of the common tendency to maneuver too close to the runway at altitudes lower than your normal VFR pattern altitude.  Using the same visual  cues  that  you  use  from  normal  VFR  pattern  altitudes  causes  this.    Select  a pattern that displaces you far enough from the runway that will allow you to turn to final without overbanking or overshooting final. 13.7.  Side-Step Maneuver Procedures.  Where a side-step procedure is published, aircraft may make an instrument  approach to  a  runway  or  airport  and then visually maneuver to  land on an alternate runway specified in the procedure.  Landing minimums to the adjacent runway will be higher than the minimums to the primary runway, but will normally be lower than the published circling minimums. 13.7.1.  Phraseology.    Examples  of  ATC  phraseology  used  to  clear  aircraft  for  these procedures  are:  ―Cleared  for  ILS  runway  seven  left  approach.    Side-step  to  runway  seven right.‖ 13.7.2.  Begin Side-step.  Pilots are normally expected to commence the side-step maneuver as soon as possible after the runway or runway environment is in sight.  Typically this occurs inside  the  FAF.    Beginning  the  side-step  maneuver  prior  to  the  FAF  could  cause  a  conflict with  other  traffic,  especially  when  using  parallel  runways.    Compliance  with  minimum altitudes  associated  with  stepdown  fixes  is  expected  even  after  the  side-step  maneuver  is initiated. 13.7.3.  Lose  Visual.    As  in  a  circling  approach,  if  you  lose  visual  reference  during  the maneuver,  follow  the  missed  approach  specified  for  the  approach  procedure  just  flown, unless  otherwise  directed.    An  initial  climbing  turn  toward  the  landing  runway  will  ensure that the aircraft remains within the obstruction clearance area. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   249  Chapter 14 MISSED APPROACH 14.1.  Planning.  Performing a missed approach successfully is the result of thorough planning.  You should familiarize yourself with the missed approach departure instructions during preflight planning.    The  missed  approach  departure  instruction  is  designed  to  return  the  aircraft  to  an altitude providing en route obstruction clearance.  In some cases the aircraft may be returned to the initial segment of the approach. 14.2.  Missed Approach Point (MAP).  The missed approach point for a nonprecision straight-in  approach  is  located  along  the  final  approach  course  and  no  farther  from  the  FAF  than  the runway  threshold  (or  over  an  on-airport  navigation  facility  for  a  no-FAF  procedure  and  some selected FAF procedures).  To determine the location of the MAP, compare the distance from the FAF to the MAP adjacent to the timing block.  It may not be the same point as depicted in the profile view.  If there is not a timing block, the MAP should be clearly portrayed on the IAP. 14.2.1.  NOTE:  The MAP depicted on the IAP is for the non-radar approach with the lowest HAT.  For example, on an ILS approach designed by the FAA, the MAP printed will be for the  ILS  DA/DH.    The  MAP  for  the  localizer  will  probably  be  at  the  approach  end  of  the runway and the only way to determine this is by the distance listed on the timing block. 14.2.2.  Circling.  The MAP for a circling approach is also located along the final approach course.  It will be no farther from the FAF than the first portion of the usable landing surface (or over an on-airport navigation facility for a no-FAF procedure). 14.2.3.  Precision.    The  missed  approach  point  for  any  precision  approach  is  the  point  at which the DA/DH is reached.  This is normally the point depicted on the IAP as the start of a climbing dashed line. 14.2.4.  Obstacle  Clearance.    The  published  missed  approach  procedure  provides  obstacle clearance only when the missed approach is conducted on the missed approach segment from or above the missed approach point. If the aircraft initiates a missed approach at a point prior to the missed approach point, from below MDA or DH, or on a circling approach, obstacle clearance is not necessarily provided by following the published missed approach procedure.  During pre-approach planning, the pilot should assess the actions to be taken in the event of a balked landing beyond the missed approach point or below the MDA or DA(H) based on the anticipated weather conditions and available aircraft performance. If balked landing occurs at a position where it is no longer possible to fly the published missed approach and alternative missed  approach  instructions  are  not  available  from  ATC,  obstacle  clearance  is  the  pilot's responsibility. When a missed approach is initiated in this situation, the pilot must consider other factors such as the aircraft's geographical location with respect to the prescribed missed approach point, direction of flight and/or minimum turning altitudes in the prescribed missed approach procedure, aircraft performance, visual climb restrictions, charted obstacles, takeoff obstacle departure procedure, takeoff visual climb requirements as expressed by nonstandard takeoff minima, or other factors not specifically expressed by the approach procedures. If the pilot  executes  any  procedure  other  than  the  published  missed,  they  should  advise  ATC  as soon as possible with current actions and intentions.   250  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 14.2.4.1.  Note:    For  copter  only  approaches,  the  missed  approach  is  based  on  a  climb gradient  of  at  least  400  feet  per  mile;  twice  the  angle  used  for  fixed-wing  instrument approach procedures.  If a 90 knot (no wind) missed approach is performed, then this climb gradient equates to a 600 foot per minute minimum rate of climb. 14.2.5.  Initiation.  When the missed approach is initiated prior to the MAP, the pilot shall, unless  otherwise  cleared  by  ATC,  fly  the  IAP  as  specified  on  the  approach  plate  to  the MAP at or above the DA/DH before executing a turning maneuver. 14.2.6.  Delayed Decision.   If on arrival at the MAP or DH/DA (or at any time thereafter) any  of  the  requirements  in  paragraph  12.1.2.2  are  not  met,  the  pilot  shall  immediately execute the appropriate missed approach procedure, ATC issued climb out instructions or other  ATC  clearance.    Missed  approach  obstacle  clearance  is  predicated  on  beginning  the missed  approach  procedure  at  the  MAP  from  DA/DH  and  then  climbing  200  ft/NM  or greater.  Initiating a go-around after passing the published MAP may result in loss of obstacle clearance. See 14.2.4. 14.2.7.  Radar  Approach.    When  flying  a  radar  approach,  missed  approach  departure instructions  will  be  given  if  weather  reports  indicate  that  any  portion  of  the  final  approach will be conducted in IFR conditions.  At USAF bases where missed approach instructions are published in base flying regulations, controllers may not issue missed approach instructions to locally assigned aircraft. 14.3.  Missed  Approach/Departure  Instructions.  A  clearance  for  an  approach  includes clearance  for  the  missed  approach  published  on  the  IAP,  unless  ATC  issues  alternate  missed approach instructions. 14.3.1.  Multiple Approaches.  Prior to the FAF, the controller is required to issue appropriate departure instructions to be followed upon completion of approaches that are not to full stop landings.    The  pilot  should  tell  the  controller  how  the  approach  will  terminate  prior  to beginning  the  approach.    The  controller  will  state,  ―After  completion  of  your  low approach/touch-and-go/stop-and-go/option,  climb  and  maintain  (altitude),  turn  right/left heading (degrees).‖  These instructions are often referred to as ―climb out instructions‖ and are  designed  to  return  you  to  the  traffic  pattern.    At  locations  where  ATC  radar  service  is provided,  the  pilot  should  conform  to  radar  vectors  when  provided  by  ATC  in  lieu  of the published missed approach procedure.  Unless otherwise instructed, initiate an immediate climb to the assigned altitude.  Delay any turns until past the departure end of the runway, if visible, and 400 feet AGL.  If the departure end is not visible, climb on runway heading until  400  feet  AGL  before  beginning  your  turn.    If  you  are  unable  to  comply  with previously  issued  climb  out  instructions,  comply  with  the  published  missed  approach procedure and inform ATC immediately.  This will ensure ATC is aware of your intentions and can issue alternative instructions if necessary. 14.3.1.1.  When  practicing  instrument  approaches  under  VFR  IAW  AFI  11-202V3,  you are  expected  to  comply  with  climb  out  instructions  and  are  NOT  automatically  cleared for  the  published  missed  approach  procedure  if  you  cannot  comply  with  the  climb  out instructions.    When  practicing  instrument  approaches  under  VFR,  the  pilot  must request  and  receive  a  specific  clearance  to  execute  the  published  missed  approach procedure. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   251  14.3.2.  Circling Approaches.  Executing climb out instructions in conjunction with a circling approach  is  more  complicated.    If  upon  reaching  the  missed  approach  point  the  airport environment is not in sight, execute the climb out  instructions from the missed approach point.    If  the  circling  maneuver  has  begun  and  the  airport  environment  is  visually  lost, begin  an  initial  climbing  turn  toward  the  landing  runway  to  ensure  the  aircraft  remains within  the  obstruction  clearance  area.    Continue  this  turn  until  established  on  the  climb out instructions. 14.4.  Actual Missed Approach.  If you have been cleared to land (full stop), ATC expects you to  land;  therefore,  if  you  have  been  cleared  to  land  and  must  subsequently  execute  a  missed approach,  the  pilot  shall  notify  ATC  as  soon  as  possible  and  execute  the  published  missed approach unless issued alternate climb out instructions. 14.4.1.  Various Terms.  There are various terms in the missed approach departure instruction written  on  the  IAP  that  have  specific  meanings  with  respect  to  climbing  to  an  altitude, executing a turn for obstruction avoidance and other reasons.  Here are some examples: 14.4.1.1.  ―Climb and maintain‖ means a normal climb along the prescribed course. 14.4.1.2.  ―Climb and maintain (altitude), turn right (heading)‖ means climbing right turn as soon as safety permits, normally to clear obstructions.  This instruction may be given with the turn direction stated first. 14.4.1.3.  ―Climb and maintain 2,400‖ means climb to 2,400 feet before ATC will issue a turn  instruction,  normally  to  clear  obstructions.    ATC  may  state:  ―Climb  and  maintain 2,400, then turn right (heading),‖ to accomplish the same. 14.4.2.  Accomplishing the Missed Approach. 14.4.2.1.  When  to  do  the  Missed  Approach.    The  pilot  shall  perform  the  missed approach when the missed approach point,  decision height  (DH), or  decision altitude (DA) is reached and any of the 3 following conditions exists: 14.4.2.1.1.  The runway environment is not in sight. 14.4.2.1.2.  You are unable to make a safe landing. 14.4.2.1.3.  You are directed by the controlling agency. 14.4.2.2.  Fly  the  Aircraft.    When  you  decide  to  execute  the  missed  approach,  fly  the aircraft in accordance with the flight manual missed approach procedures. 14.4.2.3.  Transition.  Transition from the approach to the missed approach in a positive manner using precise attitude and power control changes.  Establish the missed approach attitude, power setting, and configuration prescribed in the flight manual.  Crosscheck the vertical  velocity  indicator  and  altimeter  for  positive  climb  indications  before  retracting the  gear  and  wing  flaps.    Since  aircraft  control  will  require  almost  total  attention,  you should  have  the  first  heading,  course,  and  altitude  in  mind  before  reaching  the  missed approach point. 14.4.2.3.1.  If  you decide to  execute a missed approach prior to  reaching the missed approach  point,  continue  along  the  IAP  routing  at  or  above  the  DA/DH  until reaching the missed approach point.  You may climb to the missed approach altitude while following the IAP routing.  Do not initiate any turns on the missed approach   252  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 until reaching the missed approach point.  If ATC issues you a vector on the missed approach, consider this your new clearance. 14.4.2.4.  Lose Visual Reference.   If  visual  reference  is  lost while  circling  to  land, the pilot shall follow the missed approach specified for the approach procedure just flown, unless  otherwise  directed.    An  initial  climbing  turn  toward  the  landing  runway  will ensure that the aircraft remains within the circling obstruction clearance area.  Continue to  turn  until  established  on  the  missed  approach  course  (Figure  14.1).    An  immediate climb must be initiated to ensure climb gradient requirements are met. Figure 14.1.  Missed Approach from the Circling Approach.  14.4.3.  Climb Gradient.  The pilot shall ensure that the aircraft can achieve the published climb  gradient.  When  the  gradient  is  not  published,  climb  at  least  200  feet  per  nautical mile  in  order  to  clear  obstructions.    See  AFI  11-202V3,  for  engine  out  performance requirements. 14.4.4.  Request clearance.  As soon as practical after initiating the missed approach, advise ATC  and  request  clearance  for  specific  action;  that  is,  to  an  alternate  airport,  another approach, or holding.  Do not sacrifice aircraft control for the sake of a voice transmission. 14.4.5.  Obstacle Clearance.  Terrain  clearance is provided within established boundaries of the  approach  course  and  the  missed  approach  path.    It  is  essential  that  you  follow  the procedure depicted on the IAP chart or the instructions issued by the controller.  Be aware of the  minimum  safe  altitudes  found  on  the  IAP  charts.    Remember  that  the  missed  approach climb gradient begins at the published MAP. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   253  Chapter 15 INTERNATIONAL CIVIL AVIATION ORGANIZATION (ICAO) PROCEDURES 15.1.  Introduction.  The  ICAO  is  composed  of  over  180  member  nations  and  is  a  part  of  the United  Nations.  Unlike  the  FAA,  whose  regulations  are  directive,  ICAO  is  an  advisory organization  that  jointly  agrees  on  procedural  criteria.  Although  the  ICAO  does  not  have  any enforcement  authority,  ICAO  member  nations  do  undertake  an  obligation  to  adopt  the  annexes and  procedures  adopted  as  standard  by  the  ICAO.  These  are  published  in  a  document  called Procedures for Air Navigation Services-Aircraft Operations (PANS-OPS), in the Annexes to the Convention, and Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPS). Member nations are required to  publish  their  exceptions  to  PANS-OPS  and  SARPS  in  their  individual  Aeronautical Information  Publication  (AIP).  Most  nations  do  this  and  follow  the  ICAO  publication  of aeronautical  information  SARPS  in  Annex  15.  These  procedures  are  intended  to  be  strictly adhered to by flight crews in order to achieve and maintain an acceptable level of safety in flight operations. USAF aircrews will find pertinent information extracted from the AIPs in FLIP AP and the Foreign Clearance Guide (FCG). 15.1.1.  The ICAO Convention does contain an exemption for state aircraft. However, there should be a due regard exercised for the safety of navigation of civil  aircraft.  USAF  crews shall  comply  with  guidance  in  AFI  11-202V3  regarding  compliance  with  ICAO procedures. 15.1.1.1.  NOTE:  Although  an  ICAO  signatory,  the  United  States  uses  none  of  the PANS-OPS  procedures.  We  use  the  Federal  Aviation  Regulations  for  procedural guidance instead as an equivalent to an AIP. 15.1.2.  The  Continuum  of  Safety.  Even  more  so  than  in  the  United  States,  international flying requires good judgment on the part of the pilot. The Air Force expects and encourages you  to  apply  it.  No  book  of  hard  and  fast  rules  could  ever  hope  to  cover  all  the  various situations  you  may  encounter  everywhere  in  the  world.  The  global  mission  of  the  USAF means  that  you  may  well  be  required  to  operate  in  countries  without  a  well  developed aviation system, or into airfields where the ICAO rules have been ignored, replaced or poorly applied.  The  PIC  must  necessarily  be  the  final  judge  of  what  is  safe  and  prudent  for  any given mission on any given day. A thorough review of all flight planning documents prior to departure is critical. 15.1.2.1.  While English is the standard language of aviation, in many parts of the world you will hear native languages being spoken over ATC frequencies.  Knowing, and using, standard  terms  from  FLIP  GP,  AIM,  the  ICAO  nation‘s  AIP,  and  the  Pilot-Controller glossary  reduces  the  chance  of  misinterpreting  a  clearance  or  misunderstanding information  from  controllers  with  heavy  accents.    At  all  times,  and  especially  when working with ATC controllers whose native language is not English, USAF pilots  shall use  standard  aviation  terminology  and  phraseology.    USAF  pilots  are  required  to clarify with ATC any clearance that is not completely understood. 15.1.2.2.  While  most  terminology  has  been  standardized  between  the  FAA  and  ICAO, there are minor differences that should be known to aircrews.  Five of the most common verbiage differences include:   254  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 15.1.2.2.1.  ―Position and Hold‖ (FAA) – ―Line up and Wait‖ (ICAO) 15.1.2.2.2.  ―Say Altitude‖ (FAA) – ―Verify Level‖ (ICAO) 15.1.2.2.3.  ―Hold Short Line‖ (FAA) – ―Holding Point‖ (ICAO) 15.1.2.2.4.  ―Back Taxi‖ (FAA) – ―Back Track‖ (ICAO) 15.1.2.2.5.  ―Airport‖ (FAA) – ―Aerodrome‖ (ICAO) 15.1.2.3.  SID STAR Phraseology.  Approximately half of the world‘s aircraft operations experience  SID  and  STAR  altitude  (level)  restrictions  that  are  automatically  cancelled with a new altitude assignment; the remainder experience SID and STAR altitude (level) restrictions that continue to apply until explicitly cancelled, potentially causing confusion amongst aircrews.  ICAO signatories are attempting to alleviate this confusion with new standardized  phraseology.    The  following  verbiage  may  be  expected  while  operating under ICAO rules: 15.1.2.3.1.  ―Climb (level) via SID‖, meaning ―Climb following the level restrictions or requirements published on the SID.‖ 15.1.2.3.2.  ―Open Climb (level)‖, meaning ―Climb to (level) without stopping at any vertical  restriction  on  the  SID  and  without  being  required  to  meet  any  vertical requirement on the SID.‖ 15.1.2.3.3.  ―Descend  (level)  via  STAR‖,  meaning  ―Descend  following  the  level restrictions or requirements published on the STAR.‖ 15.1.2.3.4.  ―Open Descent (level)‖, meaning ―Descend to (level) without stopping at any vertical restrictions on the STAR and without being required to meet any vertical requirements on the STAR.‖ 15.1.2.4.  Aircrew  should  familiarize  themselves  with  country  and  area  specific requirements prior to flying into an unfamiliar region.  ICAO publications can be found online  at  http://dcaa.slv.dk:8000/icaodocs/.  AIP is  available  at http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/ifim/. information 15.1.3.  Applicability. Procedures described in this chapter apply only in airspace not under FAA control. These procedures are ICAO standard procedures and may be modified by each country (as the U.S. has). 15.1.3.1.  When  determining  whether  to  apply  FAA  or  ICAO  procedures  in  flying  an instrument  procedure,  the  nationality  of  the  air  traffic  controller  or  who  produced  the procedure  is  not  relevant.  The  geographic  location  of  the  aircraft  is  the  determining factor,  unless  local  procedures  (detailed  in  FLIP  and/or  local  directives)  are  in  place. Regardless  of  the  nationality  of  the  air  traffic  controller  and/or  the  origin  of  the instrument  procedure  you  are  using,  if  you  are  flying  outside  US  National  Airspace, apply ICAO instrument procedures unless otherwise published. 15.1.3.2.  US  National  Airspace  is  defined  as  airspace  controlled  by  the  FAA.  This airspace  is  defined  geographically  as  overlying  the  50  United  States,  the  District  of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the several territories and possessions (ex.  Marianas  Islands,  etc.)  of  the  United  States.  By  Presidential  proclamation  in December 1988, this airspace also overlies the waters up to 12 miles from the coast. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   255  15.1.3.2.1.  IAW  ICAO  Article  12  and  Annexes  2  and  11,  the  United  States  has accepted responsibility for providing air traffic services within airspace overlying the high  seas  beyond  12  miles  from  the  coast  (also  known  as  international  airspace). These  flight  information  regions  of  international  airspace  are:  Oakland  Oceanic, Anchorage  Oceanic,  Anchorage  Continental,  Anchorage  Arctic,  Miami  Oceanic, Houston  Oceanic,  and  New  York  Oceanic.  Although  the  FAA  in  these  areas  is providing  air  traffic  services,  they  are  considered  international  airspace  and  ICAO rules apply. 15.1.4.  Finding Current Information and Procedures. Changes to ICAO standard procedures can  be  numerous  and  may  even  vary  from  airfield  to  airfield  within  a  country.  FLIP  Area Planning (AP) generally contains a comprehensive consolidation of procedural requirements, but  a  thorough  review  of  all  applicable  preflight  planning  sources  is  essential  to  ensuring compliance  with  ICAO,  host  nation,  and  USAF  requirements.  Other  preflight  planning sources include, but are not limited to: NOTAMS, the ASRR, Specific Theatre  Information Files (STIF), and MAJCOM/Unit Flight Crew Information File (FCIF). 15.1.5.  Terminal IAPs. There are many different kinds of approaches published in the DoD FLIP books for regions outside the United States. You may find approaches designed using U.S.  TERPS  at  overseas  bases.  You  may  also  find  approaches  designed  under  the  civil PANS-OPS  criteria.  Or  you  may  find  procedures  that  use  host  nation  criteria  that  are different  from  PANS-OPS.  Aircraft  executing  maneuvers  other  than  those  intended  by  the host  nation  approach  design  could  exceed  the  boundaries  of  the  protected  airspace  or  may cause  overflight  of  unauthorized  areas.  All  ICAO  procedures  must  be  flown  as  they  are depicted. 15.1.5.1.  NOTE: For procedures designed in accordance with host nation or PANS-OPS criteria, the original foreign procedures may have been modified or edited as a result of the  DoD  TERPS  review,  which  is  conducted  before  these  procedures  are  published  in DoD FLIP. 15.2.  Definitions.  Here are a few ICAO definitions that differ from those commonly used in the United States. 15.2.1.  PANS-OPS. PANS-OPS is a two-part document. The first volume is for pilots, and is similar to the FAA‘s AIM. The second volume contains the ICAO ―TERPS.‖ The document is  intended  for  the  use  of  the  international  civilian  aviation  community,  not  the  military. There  have  been  a  number  of  editions  of  PANS-OPS  published  since  the  creation  of  the ICAO, each with significant changes in the details of instrument approach procedure design. This  means  that  you  may  find  approaches  in  different  parts  of  the  world  that  have  been designed with entirely different rules. 15.2.2.  Aircraft  Categories.  Aircraft  approach  categories  play  a  much  bigger  role  in  the design of ICAO instrument procedures than they do in the U. S. In addition to affecting final approach  minimums,  PANS-OPS  references  maximum  speeds  by  category  for  such operations  as  holding,  departures,  and  the  intermediate  segments  of  instrument  approaches. To make matters even more confusing, these additional ―category‖ restrictions specify speeds that  are  completely  different  from  the  familiar  approach  speeds  on  final.  The  appropriate PANS-OPS ―category‖ speeds appear in tables later in this chapter.   256  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 15.2.3.  Track. The projection on the earth‘s surface of the path of an aircraft, the direction of which  path  at  any  point  is  usually  expressed  in  degrees  from  North,  specifying  true  or magnetic.  This  means  you  must  apply  any  known  winds/drift  to  maintain  the  ground  path. Obstacle  clearance  in  ICAO  procedures  is  provided  under  the  assumption  that  pilots  will maintain the depicted track. 15.2.4.  Bank Angle. Procedures are based on average achieved bank angle of 25 degrees, or the bank angle giving a rate of turn of 3 degrees per second, whichever is less. 15.2.5.  Established  on  Course.  Established  on  course  is  defined  as  being  within  half  full-scale  deflection  for  an  ILS  or  VOR/DME  and  within  ±  5°  of  the  required  bearing  for  an NDB.  Do not consider yourself “established on course” until you are within these limits.  ICAO obstacle clearance surfaces  assume that the pilot  does not  normally  deviate  from  the centerline  more  than  one-half  scale  deflection  after  being  established  on  track.  Despite  the fact that there is a range of ―acceptable‖ variation, make every attempt to fly the aircraft on the course centerline and on the glide path. Allowing a more than half-scale deflection (or a more than half-scale fly-up deflection on glideslope) combined with other system tolerances could place the aircraft near the edge or at the bottom of the protected airspace where loss of protection from obstacles can occur. 15.3.  Departure Procedures. 15.3.1.  Screen  Heights.  It  may  be  difficult  or  impossible  to  accurately  determine  screen height  used  for  a  particular  departure  procedure.  For  PANS-OPS,  the  origin  of  the  OIS begins at 16 ft (5 m) above the DER. See Chapter 7 for guidelines to determine screen height. 15.3.2.  Climb Gradient. ICAO does not apply the FAA 24% ROC formula and has retained the  traditional  48  ft/nm  (0.8%)  ROC  for  departures.  ICAO  obstacle  clearance  during departures  is  based  on  a  2.5%  gradient  obstacle  clearance  (152  feet/NM)  and  an  increasing 0.8%  obstacle  clearance  (48  feet/NM).  This  equates  to  a  minimum  climb  gradient  of  3.3% (200  feet/NM).  Minimum  climb  gradients  exceeding  3.3%  will  be  specified  to  an altitude/height after which the 3.3% will be used. 15.3.3.  Basic Rules for All Departures. Unless the procedure specifies otherwise,  you must climb  on  runway  heading  at  a  minimum  of  200  feet/NM  (3.3%)  until  reaching  400  feet above  the  DER.  Continue  to  climb  at  a  minimum  of  200  feet/NM  until  reaching  a  safe enroute altitude. 15.3.4.  Omnidirectional  Departures.  The  PANS-OPS  ―Omnidirectional  Departure‖  is somewhat similar to the FAA‘s ―Diverse Departure.‖ It is a departure procedure without any track  guidance  provided.  There  are  some  very  important  differences,  though,  because  an Omnidirectional  Departure  may  be  published  even  though  obstacles  penetrate  the  40:1 Obstacle Identification Surface. If this is the case, PANS-OPS gives the departure designer a number of ways to publish departure restrictions. These restrictions may be published singly, or in any combination. 15.3.4.1.  Standard  case.  Where  no  obstacles  penetrate  the  40:1  OIS,  then  no  departure restrictions will be published. Upon reaching 400 feet above DER, you may turn in any direction. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   257  15.3.4.2.  Specified turn altitude. The procedure may specify a 3.3% climb to an altitude where a safe omnidirectional turn can be made. 15.3.4.3.  Specified  climb  gradient.  The  procedure  may  specify  a  minimum  climb gradient of more than 3.3% to an altitude before turns are permitted. 15.3.4.4.  Sector  departure.  The  procedure  may  identify  sectors  for  which  either  a minimum turn altitude or a minimum climb gradient is specified. (For example, ―Climb straight ahead to 2000 feet before commencing a turn to the east/sector 180°- 270°). 15.3.5.  Departures  with  Track  Guidance  (SIDs).  PANS-OPS  uses  the  term  Standard Instrument  Departure  (SID)  to  refer  to  departures  using  track  guidance.  Minimum  climb gradients may apply. There are two basic types: straight and turning. 15.3.5.1.  Straight  departures.  Whenever  possible,  a  straight  departure  will  be  specified. A  departure  is  considered  ―straight‖  if  the  track  is  aligned  within  15°  of  the  runway centerline. 15.3.5.2.  Turning departures. Where a departure route requires a turn of more than 15°, a turning departure may be constructed. Turns may be specified at  an altitude/height, at  a fix or at a facility. If an obstacle prohibits turning before the departure end of the runway or  prior  to  reaching  an  altitude/height,  an  earliest  turning  point  or  a  minimum  turning altitude/height  will  be  specified.  When  it  is  necessary,  after  a  turn,  to  fly  a  heading  to intercept a specified radial/bearing, the procedure will specify the turning point, the track to be made good and the radial/bearing to be intercepted. 15.3.5.2.1.  Turning  departures  are  designed  with  maximum  speed  limits.  These maximum  speeds  may  be  published  by  category  or  by  a  note.  For  example,  these procedures may be annotated, ―Departure limited to  CAT C Aircraft‖ or  ―Departure turn  limited  to  220  KIAS  maximum.‖  You  must  comply  with  the  speed  limit published  on  the  departure  to  remain  within  protected  airspace.  If  you  require  a higher speed, ATC may approve the higher speed or assign an alternative departure procedure. 15.3.5.2.2.  If  the  departure  is  limited  to  specific  aircraft  categories,  the  applicable speeds are found in Table 15.1. Table 15.1.  Maximum Airspeed on Departure. Aircraft Category Max Airspeed (KIAS) A B C D E 120 165 265 290 300 15.4.  Low Altitude Approach Procedures. 15.4.1.  Procedural  Tracks.  Procedural  Track  approaches  are  the  most  common  way  of transitioning from the enroute structure. These approaches are often much more complicated   258  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 than  a  comparable  U.S.  approach,  and  may  include  multiple  NAVAIDs,  fixes  and  course changes, but they are flown essentially the same as described in Chapter 11. 15.4.2.  Reversal Procedures and Racetrack Procedures. If the instrument approach cannot be designed as a procedural track arrival, then a reversal procedure or a racetrack or a holding pattern is required. 15.4.2.1.  Reversal  Procedures.  ICAO  ―Reversal  Procedures‖  are  similar  in  concept  to FAA  ―Procedure  Turns.‖  The  ICAO  recognizes  three  distinctly  different  methods  of performing  a  ―reversal  procedure,‖  each  with  its  own  airspace  characteristics:  the 45°/180° Procedure Turn (Figure 15.1), the 80°/260° Procedure Turn (Figure 15.2), and the Base Turn (Figure 15.3). 15.4.2.1.1.  Entry is restricted to  a specific direction or sector. To remain  within the airspace provided requires strict adherence to the directions and timing specified. 15.4.2.1.1.1.  NOTE:  The  protected  airspace  for  ―reversal  procedures‖  does  not permit a racetrack or holding maneuver to be conducted unless so specified. You may  not  enter  an  ICAO  procedure  turn  using  the  “Holding  Technique” described in Chapter 11. Instead, refer to the entry procedures below. 15.4.2.1.2.  The 45°/180° Procedure Turn. This procedure starts at a facility or fix and consists of: 15.4.2.1.2.1.  A straight leg with track guidance; this straight leg may be timed or limited by a radial or DME distance; 15.4.2.1.2.2.  A  45°  turn;  commenced  at  the  designated  radial  or  DME  fix,  or  at the completion of the published timing requirement; 15.4.2.1.2.3.  A straight leg without track guidance. This straight leg is timed; it is 1 minute from the start of the turn for categories A and B aircraft and 1 minute 15 seconds from the start of the turn for categories C, D and E aircraft; 15.4.2.1.2.4.  A 180° turn in the opposite direction to intercept the inbound 15.4.2.1.2.4.1.  NOTE: You must adjust the time or distance on the outbound track  to  ensure  the  reversal  is  initiated  at  a  point  specified  on  the  IAP  if  so depicted, or the maneuver is  completed within the specified ―remain within‖ distance. 15.4.2.1.3.  The 80°/260° Procedure Turn. This procedure starts at a facility or fix and consists of: 15.4.2.1.3.1.  A straight leg with track guidance; this straight leg may be timed or limited by a radial or DME distance; 15.4.2.1.3.2.  An 80° turn; commenced at the designated radial or DME fix, or at the completion of the published timing requirement, followed immediately by; 15.4.2.1.3.3.  A 260° turn in the opposite direction to intercept the inbound track. 15.4.2.1.3.3.1.  NOTE: You must adjust the time or distance on the outbound track  to  ensure  the  reversal  is  initiated  at  a  point  specified  on  the  IAP  if  so depicted, or the maneuver is completed within the specified ―remain within‖ AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   259  distance. 15.4.2.1.3.4.  While  executing  this  procedure,  comply  with  the  speeds  in paragraph  15.4.2.2.8.1  or  as  published  on  the  procedure.  Also,  comply  with  the bank angle restrictions of paragraph 15.2.4. 15.4.2.1.4.  The Base Turn. This procedure consists of intercepting and maintaining a specified  outbound  track,  timing  from  the  facility  or  proceeding  to  a  specified  fix, followed by a turn to intercept the inbound track. 15.4.2.1.4.1.  NOTE:  The  base  turn  procedure  is  not  optional.  You  may  not  fly one of the “procedure turns” described above instead of the depicted base turn. More than one track may be depicted depending on aircraft category. Figure 15.1.  45°/180° Course Reversal. Figure 15.2.  80°/260° Course Reversal.     260  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 Figure 15.3.  Base Turns. 15.4.2.2.  Reversal  Procedure  Entry  (Figure  15.4).  Of  all  the  differences  between  FAA and ICAO procedures, the entry into the three course reversal maneuvers has historically been the area of greatest confusion for USAF pilots. A short discussion is in order:  15.4.2.2.1.  The 30° Entry Sector. The reason PANS-OPS specifies this entry sector is because,  unlike  in  the  U.  S.,  the  course  reversal  protected  airspace  may  not  include any airspace except that on the outbound side of the procedure turn fix. In the U.S., protected airspace includes a large ―entry zone‖ surrounding the fix. the  procedure  specifies  particular  entry  restrictions, 15.4.2.2.2.  Unless the 45°/180°, 80°/260°, and base turn reversal procedures must be entered from a track within ± 30° of the outbound reversal track (Figure 15.5). There is a special rule for base turns: for base turns where the ± 30° entry sector does not include the reciprocal of  the  inbound  track,  the  entry  sector  is  expanded  to  include  the  reciprocal.  (Figure 15.6). If the aircraft‘s arrival track is not within the entry sector: 15.4.2.2.2.1.  Comply with the published entry restrictions or arrival routing; or 15.4.2.2.2.2.  If there is a suitable arrival holding pattern published, enter holding prior to the reversal procedure; or 15.4.2.2.2.3.  If there is no published routing or suitable holding pattern, use good judgment while maneuvering the aircraft into the entry sector. 15.4.2.2.2.4.  For racetrack entry, see paragraph 15.4.2.3. 15.4.2.2.3.  What if you Arrive From Outside the Entry Sector? 15.4.2.2.3.1.  Arrival  Routing.  There  is  often  some  form  of  published  arrival routing  into  the  course  reversal  IAF,  such  as  a  STAR,  feeder  routing,  or  arrival airway.  This  arrival  routing  may  not  fall  into  the  30-degree  entry  sector.  Such arrival routes will be blended into the reversal approach, and protected airspace is provided  to  allow  the  pilot  to  turn  onto  the  outbound  reversal  track.  Pilots  need not  request  ―maneuvering  airspace‖  to  perform  an  alignment  maneuver.  Such requests  are  often  met  with  confusion  by  ATC.  You  should  remain  within protected airspace on the published arrival routing, whether or not that happens to AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   261  align you with the 30° entry sector. 15.4.2.2.3.2.  Using the Arrival Holding Pattern. On most ICAO course reversals, a  holding  pattern  is  published  at  or  near  the  IAF  to  accommodate  arrivals  from outside  the  30-degree  sector  and  not  on  a  published  arrival  routing.  PANS-OPS directs  pilots  arriving  from  outside  the  entry  sector  to  enter  holding  prior  to  the reversal  procedure.  In  most  cases,  the  holding  pattern  will  align  you  for  the approach. 15.4.2.2.3.3.  Off-airway  Arrivals.  What  if  there  is  no  suitable  Holding  Pattern? The danger arises when attempting to perform the course reversal when arriving into  the  IAF  from  a  direction  not  anticipated  by  the  approach  designer,  such  as when you request to proceed direct to the fix from a point off the arrival airway. Sometimes there is no holding pattern published for your alignment, or there is a holding pattern that does not turn you into the entry sector. In this case, you will need to maneuver into the entry sector somehow. You must understand how small the  protected  airspace  is,  especially  when  compared  to  an  FAA  procedure  turn. You may be operating completely outside of protected airspace while proceeding to the IAF, and terrain and obstacle clearance may be totally up to you. Use good judgment, consider the published minimum  safe/sector altitudes, and do not  rely solely on ATC to keep you safe.   262  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 Figure 15.4.  Comparison of FAA and ICAO Protected Airspace for a Procedure Turn. Figure 15.5.  Procedure Turn Entry (45°/180° or 80°/260°).   AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   263  Figure 15.6.  Base Turn Entry.  15.4.2.2.4.  Timing. Begin timing to comply with published times or ―remain within‖ distances  when  outbound  abeam  the  facility  or  fix.  If  the  abeam  position  cannot  be determined while in a turn, start timing after completing the turn. 15.4.2.2.5.  Descent. A descent can be depicted at any point along a course reversal. When a descent is depicted at the IAF, start descent when abeam or past the IAF and on a parallel or intercept heading to the depicted outbound track. For descents past the IAF, be established on a segment of the IAP before beginning a descent to the altitude associated with that segment. 15.4.2.2.6.  NOTE: According to the ICAO‘s definition, ―established on a segment‖ is considered being within half full-scale deflection for an ILS or VOR and within ± 5° of the required bearing for the NDB. 15.4.2.2.7.  Remaining Within Protected Airspace. To ensure that  you remain within protected airspace while executing ICAO course reversals, you must comply with the following: 15.4.2.2.7.1.  Fly  no  faster  than  the  maximum  speed  for  your  category  in  Table 15.2 or the maximum airspeed published on the procedure, whichever is lower; 15.4.2.2.7.2.  Comply  with  the  entry  sector  requirements  of  paragraph  15  4.2 (i.e. 30° entry sector); 15.4.2.2.7.3.  Begin the course reversal at the fix specified in the procedure; 15.4.2.2.7.4.  Comply with the bank angle restrictions in paragraph 15  2.4; 15.4.2.2.7.5.  Begin required timing at the appropriate location; 15.4.2.2.7.6.  Apply drift corrections to track the published ground track. 15.4.2.2.8.  Airspeed Restrictions.  Before reaching the IAF, reduce to maneuvering airspeed. Use holding speed if maneuvering speed is not specified for your aircraft.   264  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 Table 15.2.  Maximum Approach Speeds. CATEGORY MAXIMUM SPEED A B C D E 110 140 240 250 250 15.4.2.2.8.1.  Additional speed restrictions may be charted on individual IAPs and must  be  complied  with.  However,  the  maximum  speeds  by  category,  as  shown above, will not be exceeded without approval of the appropriate ATC agency. Figure 15.7.  Racetrack Procedure.  15.4.2.3.  The  Racetrack  (Figure  15.7).  The  ICAO  ―Racetrack  Procedure‖  is  similar  in concept  to  an  FAA  ―Holding  In  Lieu  of  Procedure  Turn.‖  This  maneuver  consists  of  a holding  pattern  with  outbound  leg  lengths  of  1  to  3  minutes,  specified  in  30-second increments.  As  an  alternative  to  timing,  a  DME  distance  or  an  intersecting  radial  or bearing may limit the outbound leg. 15.4.2.3.1.  Racetrack Entry Procedure. Normally a racetrack procedure is used when aircraft  arrive  overhead  the  fix  from  various  directions.  Entry  procedures  for  a racetrack  are  the  same  as  entry  procedures  for  holding  patterns  with  several exceptions: 15.4.2.3.1.1.  The  teardrop  offset  should  be  planned  using  30°  from  the  inbound course. 15.4.2.3.1.2.  The teardrop entry from sector 2 is  limited to  1 1/2  minutes wings level on the 30-degree teardrop track, after which the pilot is expected to turn to a heading to parallel the outbound track for the remainder of the outbound time. If the outbound time is only 1 minute, the time on the 30 degree teardrop track will be 1 minute also. 15.4.2.3.1.3.  Parallel  entries  may  not  return  directly  to  the  facility  without  first intercepting the inbound track. 15.4.2.3.1.4.  All  maneuvering  will  be  done  as  much  as  practical  on  the AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   265  maneuvering side of the inbound track. 15.4.2.3.1.4.1.  NOTE: When necessary due to airspace limitations, entry into the  racetrack  procedure  may  be  restricted  to  specified  routes.  When  so restricted, the entry routes will be depicted on the IAP. Racetrack procedures are  used  where  sufficient  distance  is  not  available  in  a  straight  segment  to accommodate  the  required  loss  of  altitude  and  when  entry  into  a  reversal maneuver  is  not  practical.  They  may  also  be  specified  as  alternatives  to reversal procedures to increase operational flexibility. 15.4.2.3.2.  Shuttle  Procedure.  A  ―Shuttle‖  is  a  descent  or  climb  conducted  in  a holding  pattern.  A  shuttle  is  normally  specified  where  the  descent  required  between the  end  of  the  initial  approach  and  the  beginning  of  the  final  approach  exceeds standard ICAO approach design limits. 15.4.2.3.3.  Alternate Procedures: There may be alternate procedures specified to any of  the  procedures  described  above.  IAPs  will  contain  the  appropriate  depiction  and the  words  ―alternative  procedure.‖  Pilots  should  be  prepared  to  execute  either procedure. Prior to accepting clearance for an approach that depicts an alternative procedure, determine which procedure the controlling agency expects. 15.4.2.3.4.  Circling  Procedures.  ICAO  circling  protected  airspace  is  typically  larger than US TERPS and the ROC is higher. One important distinction to make is between the terms ―runway environment‖ and ―airport environment.” While circling using an ICAO-designed  procedure,  you  must  maintain  visual  contact  with  the  runway environment  (as  defined  in  paragraph  12.1.2.2)  throughout  the  entire  circling maneuver. In the United States, you are only required to maintain visual contact with the airport environment while circling to land, but cannot descend out of the circling MDA  until  the  runway  environment  is  in  sight.  Use  Table  15.3  to  determine maximum airspeeds for circling. Table 15.3.  Maximum Airspeeds for Circling Approaches. APPROACH CATEGORY MAXIMUM SPEED A B C D E 100 135 180 205 240 15.4.3.  Localizer (LLZ) (Figure 15.8). PANS-OPS abbreviates the localizer facility as LLZ. The accuracy of the signal generated by the LZZ is the same as a LOC. PANS-OPS normally requires  the  LLZ  final  approach  track  alignment  to  remain  within  5°  of  the  runway centerline. However, in certain cases, the alignment can exceed 5°. Where required, PANS-OPS  allows  an  increase  of  the  final  approach  track  to  15°  for  categories  C,  D,  and  E.  For aircraft categories A and B, the maximum angle formed by the final approach track and the runway centerline is 30°.   266  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 15.4.3.1.  NOTE: Prior to flying a LDA or LLZ, compare the final approach course with the  runway  heading.  The  aerodrome  sketch  should  provide  a  visual  indication  of  the angle formed between the final approach track and the runway centerline. Figure 15.8.  LLZ Approach.  15.4.4.  Constant  Descent  Final Approach  (CDFA).  Member States of the European  Union are beginning to publish non-precision approaches as CDFAs.  These procedures differ from traditional  nonprecision  approaches  in  that  instead  of  being  flown  as  ―dive  and  drive‖ (descend from the FAF at 1200-1500 fpm to the MDA and then drive to the MAP), they are intended  to  be  flown  as  a  continuous  descent,  without  level  off,  to  the  Decision  Altitude (Height), annotated as DA(H).  The CDFA technique simplifies the final segment of the non-precision approach by incorporating techniques similar to those used when flying a precision approach procedure. CDFA instrument procedures include tabular information in the minima section with ground speed in knots and descent angle.  Flying the resulting VVI will result in arriving at the DA(H) at the VDP. 15.4.4.1.  NOTE:  Unlike the DH on a precision approach procedure which accounts for height-loss  (dip  under)  on  a  missed  approach,  that  is  not  the  case  for  a  DA(H).    The AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   267  airspace below the DA(H) does not  guarantee obstacle clearance.  A technique to avoid descending through the DA(H) is to create a derived DA by adding a buffer (e.g. 50 feet) to the minimum. 15.4.4.2.  If  the  visual  references  required  to  land  have  not  been  acquired  when  the aircraft  reaches  the  DA(H),  the  vertical  (climbing)  portion  of  the  missed  approach  is initiated at an altitude above the DA(H) sufficient to prevent the aircraft from descending through the DA(H). At no time is the aircraft flown in level flight at or near the DA(H). Any  turns  on  the  missed  approach  shall  not  begin  until  the  aircraft  reaches  the  MAP. Likewise,  if  the  aircraft  reaches  the  MAP  before  descending  to  near  the  DA(H),  the missed approach shall be initiated at the MAP. 15.4.5.  Timing for Missed Approach and FAF to MAP. Some host nations use non-standard timing for determining the MAP on a procedure. This means timing may go from the FAF to the  runway  threshold  or  from  a  step-down  fix  to  the  runway  threshold.  When  these  host nation  procedures  are  published  in  DoD  FLIP,  these  non-standard  timing  blocks  will  be converted to the US standard of FAF to MAP. This can induce some errors due to rounding of numbers. For this reason, when using timing to determine the MAP on a DoD procedure produced by a host nation, it is imperative that crews correctly determine the timing based on groundspeed, and then fly that groundspeed to avoid exaggerating errors already induced due to the conversion from host nation to DoD format. 15.5.  Holding. 15.5.1.  Bank Angle. Make all turns at a bank angle IAW paragraph 15.2.4. ICAO procedures do  not  allow  correcting  for  winds  by  adjusting  bank  angle.  The  ―triple-drift‖  technique described in Chapter 8 is a good way to correct for winds without varying your bank angle. 15.5.2.  Tracks. All procedures depict tracks. Attempt to maintain the track by allowing for known  winds  and  applying  corrections  to  heading  and  timing  during  entry  and  while flying in the holding pattern. 15.5.3.  Limiting Radial. When holding away from a NAVAID, where the distance from the holding fix to the NAVAID is short, a limiting radial may be specified. A limiting radial may also be specified where airspace conservation is essential. If you encounter the limiting radial first, initiate a turn onto the radial until you turn inbound. Do not exceed the limiting DME distance, if published. 15.5.4.  Holding  Entry  Procedure.  The  ICAO  holding  entry  procedure  is  a  mandatory procedure.  All  timing,  distances,  and  limiting  radials  must  be  complied  with.  Enter  the holding pattern based on your heading (±5°) relative to the three entry sectors depicted in Figure  15.9  Upon  reaching  the  holding  fix,  follow  the  appropriate  procedure  for  your entry sector: 15.5.4.1.  Sector 1 (Parallel).  Turn onto an outbound heading for the appropriate time or distance, and then turn towards the holding side to intercept the inbound track or to return to the fix. 15.5.4.2.  Sector 2 (Offset).  Turn to a heading to make good a track making an angle of 30° from the reciprocal of the inbound track on the holding side. Fly outbound for the  appropriate  period  of  time  described  in  paragraph  15.4.2.3.1.2,  until  the   268  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 appropriate limiting DME is attained, or where a limiting radial (paragraph 15.5.3) is also  specified,  either  until  the  limiting  DME  is  attained  or  until  the  limiting  radial  is encountered,  whichever  occurs  first,  then  turn  right  to  intercept  the  inbound  holding track. 15.5.4.3.  Sector 3 (Direct).  Turn and follow the holding pattern. Figure 15.9.  ICAO Holding Pattern Entry Sectors.  15.5.5.  Airspeeds.  There  is  little  standardization  of  maximum  holding  airspeeds  in  PANS-OPS.  There  are  three  completely  different  tables  of  holding  airspeeds  that  an  approach designer  could  have  used,  depending  on  which  edition  of  PANS-OPS  was  used  when  the holding pattern was constructed. Many countries publish their own holding pattern airspeeds. This  information  is  supposed  to  be  published  in  FLIP,  but  it  may  be  quite  difficult  or impossible  for  to  you  to  actually  find  it.  Some  holding  pattern  airspeeds  are  published  on IAPs.  You  must  understand,  though,  that  the  concept  is  the  same  as  in  the  United  States: maximum  holding  airspeeds  are  defined  by  PANS-OPS  (or  the  host  country)  and  have  no relation to the holding speed specified in the aircraft flight manual. Table 15.4 reproduces the airspeeds from PANS-OPS and is the most common table used. Table 15.4.  ICAO Holding Airspeeds. ALTITUDE  Up to 14,000 Feet Inclusive (CAT A and B) Up to 14,000 Feet Inclusive (CAT C thru E) Above 14,000-20,000 Above 20,000-34,000 170 230 240 265 Above 34,000 .83 Mach *The  speeds  published  for  turbulence  conditions  shall  be  used  for  holding  only  after AIRSPEED Normal Conditions AIRSPEED Turbulence* 170 280 280 or .8 Mach, whichever is less 280 or .8 Mach, whichever is less .83 Mach AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   269  prior clearance with ATC, unless the relevant publications indicate that the holding area can accommodate aircraft flying at these high holding speeds. 15.5.6.  Holding  Pattern  Lengths.  On  the  second  and  subsequent  arrivals  over  the  fix,  turn and fly an outbound track that will most appropriately position the aircraft for the turn onto the inbound track. Continue outbound until the appropriate limiting distance or time. ICAO outbound legs are the limiting factor for both timed and fixed distance holding patterns. The standard  times  are:  1  minute  outbound  at  or  below  14,000  feet  MSL,  or  1  1/2  minutes outbound above 14,000 feet MSL. 15.5.7.  Wind Corrections. Attempt to correct both heading and timing to compensate for the effects  of  wind  to  ensure  the  inbound  track  is  regained  before  passing  the  holding  fix inbound.  Indications available from the NAVAID and estimated or known winds should be used in making these corrections. If a limiting radial is published and encountered prior to the outbound  limits,  it  must  be  followed  until  a  turn  inbound  is  initiated  at  the  appropriate distance/time. 15.6.  ICAO Altimeter Setting Procedures.  There are three different methods of reporting the altimeter  measurements  and  four  different  units  of  measure  used  to  express  altimeter  settings. For aircraft that have only one type of altimeter scale, or for areas where the altimeter setting is not  converted  for  you,  the  FIH  contains  conversion  tables.  It  is  critical  that  crewmembers understand how to apply the conversions prior to flight into airspace using other than inches of mercury QNH for altimeter settings. Refer to FLIP AP for specific altimeter setting procedures for each country. 15.6.1.  Methods of Reporting Altimeter Settings. 15.6.1.1.  QNH Settings. A QNH altimeter setting represents the pressure that would, in theory, exist at sea level at that location by measuring the surface pressure and correcting it  to  sea  level  pressure  for  a  standard  day.  Set  the  reported  QNH  when  descending through,  or  operating  below,  the  published  MSL  Transition  Level.  With  the  proper QNH set, the altimeter will indicate your height above MSL. All DOD approach criteria are  based  upon  using  QNH  altimeter  settings.  Some  also  provide  QFE  altitudes  in parenthesis. 15.6.1.2.  QNE Settings.  QNE is  used to  indicate  your height  above  an imaginary plane called  the  ―standard  datum  plane,‖  also  known  as  ―FL  0‖.  The  established  altimeter setting at FL 0 is 29.92 inches of Mercury (IN HG), or 1013.2 millibars or hectopascals. Set QNE (29.92) when climbing through, or operating above the Transition Altitude. 15.6.1.3.  QFE Settings. QFE is the altimeter setting issued to aircraft to indicate the AGL height above the airport. With the proper QFE set, your altimeter should indicate ―0‖ on the  ground.  The  Royal  Air  Force  and  the  Royal  Navy  in  the  United  Kingdom,  and  in many parts of the Pacific and Eastern Europe commonly use QFE. 15.6.2.  Units of Measure for Altimeter Settings. 15.6.2.1.  Inches of Mercury. The unit of measure used in the US is inches of mercury. 15.6.2.1.1.  WARNING:  In  some  areas,  controllers  will  use  shorthand  to  issue  an altimeter  setting,  which  can  cause  confusion  for  crews.  For  example,  ―992‖  could   270  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 mean 29.92 inches or 992 mb. Insure you are using the correct units of measure when setting your altimeter. 15.6.2.1.2.  NOTE: Most USAF altimeters have the ability to display either inches of mercury  or  millibars/hectopascals  by  use  of  two  different  barometric  scales  in  the window  of  the  altimeter.  Insure  you  are  using  the  proper  scale  to  set  the  altimeter setting. 15.6.2.2.  Millibars and Hectopascals. In most other parts of the world, the metric system is used and  you will hear the term  ―millibars (MB)‖ or ―hectopascals (HPa).‖ Both MB and  HPa  equal  the  same  unit  of  pressure  per  square  centimeter,  and  thus  can  be  used interchangeably. 15.6.2.3.  Millimeters  of Mercury.  This  is  primarily  used  in  Eastern  Europe  and  nations of the former USSR, and is not to be confused with millibars, which is a different unit of measure. 15.6.2.3.1.  WARNING: Do not set a millimeters value from ATC on your altimeter using  the  millibars  scale  that  is  part  of  your  altimeter  because  they  are  NOT equivalent. 15.6.3.  Transition  Altitude.  The  altitude  in  the  vicinity  of  an  airport  at  or  below  which  the vertical  position  of  an  aircraft  is  determined  from  an  altimeter  set  to  QNH  or  QFE  as appropriate. Transition altitude is normally specified for each airfield by the country in which the airfield exists. Transition altitude will not normally be below 3,000 feet HAA and must be published on the appropriate charts. 15.6.4.  Transition  Level.  The  lowest  flight  level  available  for  use  above  the  transition altitude.  Transition  level  is  usually  passed  to  the  aircraft  during  the  approach  or  landing clearances.  The  transition  layer  may  be  published,  or  it  may  be  supplied  by  ATC  via  the ATIS or during arrival. Half flight levels may be used: for example, ―FL 45.‖ 15.6.5.  Transition  Layer.  That  area  between  the  transition  altitude  and  transition  level. Aircraft are not normally assigned altitudes within the transition layer. 15.6.6.  Transition Between Flight Levels and Altitudes. The vertical position of an aircraft at or  below  transition  altitude  shall  be  expressed  in  altitude  (QNH  or  QFE  as  appropriate). Vertical  position at  or above the transition  level  shall be expressed in  terms of flight  levels (QNE).  When  passing  through  the  transition  layer,  vertical  position  shall  be  expressed  in terms  of  flight  levels  (QNE)  when  climbing  and  in  terms  of  altitudes  (QNH  or  QFE  as appropriate) when descending. After an approach clearance has been issued and the descent to land is commenced, the vertical positioning of an aircraft above the transition level may be by  reference  to  altitude  (QNH  or  QFE  as  appropriate)  provided  that  level  flight  above  the transition altitude is not indicated or anticipated. This is intended for turbo jet aircraft where an uninterrupted descent from high altitude is desired and for airfields equipped to reference altitudes throughout the descent. 15.6.7.  Altimeter Errors. The allowable altimeter errors at a ground checkpoint in ICAO are different than in the US and vary by airport elevation and atmospheric pressure. Use Tables 15.5, 15.6, and 15.7 to determine allowable altimeter errors. If your aircraft flight manual AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   271  is more restrictive than the values shown in these tables, comply with the guidance in your aircraft flight manual. Table 15.5.  Allowable Altimeter Errors at Ground Checkpoint for Airports Up to 3500 Feet Elevation With Atmospheric Pressure at or Above Standard. Airport Elevation Atmospheric Pressure Altimeter Range 3500 Feet or Below 3500 Feet or Below At or Above Standard At or Above Standard 0-30,000 Feet 0-50,000 Feet Allowable Difference ±60 Feet ±80 Feet Table 15.6.

Altimeter  Use  in  Flight.  Prior  to  take-off  at  least  one  altimeter  will  be  set  to  the latest  QNH/QFE  altimeter  setting.  Set  the  altimeter  to  QNE  (29.92)  climbing  through transition altitude. Prior to commencing the initial approach to an airfield, the number of the transition level should be obtained from the appropriate air traffic services unit. Obtain the latest QNH/QFE before descending below the transition level. 15.7.  Units of Measure for Altitudes. 15.7.1.  Some countries, particularly in Eastern Europe and nations of the former USSR, use meters to define altitudes. Most USAF aircraft do not have altimeters that can display meters. FLIP  AP  contains  information  on  units  of  measure  for  each  country.  The  FIH  has  a conversion chart for feet to meters. It is imperative to correctly convert from feet to meters when flying in these areas. 15.7.1.1.  WARNING: In some areas you may be required to fly altitudes or flight levels in meters and use an altimeter setting other than inches of mercury QNH. For example, altitude in meters using millibars QFE. Misapplication of conversions in these areas can cause  mid-air  collision  or  collision  with  the  ground.  Crews  must  insure  they  are thoroughly familiar with their aircraft system limitations and conversions prior to flight in these areas. AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   273  Chapter 16 CATEGORY II AND III ILS 16.1.  Category  II  ILS  Approach  (Airport,  Aircraft,  and  Aircrew  Certification  Required) (Figure 16  1). A Category II ILS approach provides the capability of flying to minima as low as a DH of 100 feet and an RVR of 1200. The DH for a Category II approach is identified by a pre-selected height on the aircraft radar altimeter. This figure is enclosed in parentheses on the IAP and is prefaced by RA (Radar Altimeter), example: (RA 113). 16.1.1.  Check  flight  directors,  barometric  and  radar  altimeters,  and  any  other  Category  II equipment. Set the DH on the radar altimeter (if required for the approach). 16.1.1.1.  On  certain  Category  II  ILS  approaches,  the  terminology  ―RA-NA‖  will  be annotated in the minimums section of the procedure. This indicates that the DA must be determined solely from the barometric altimeter, not the radar altimeter. 16.1.2.  Brief Category I procedures as a backup approach if appropriate. 16.1.3.  Announce the illumination of any Category II system fault identification light. 16.1.3.1.  If any required Category II component fails prior to 300 feet AGL, the system is capable of a Category I approach only unless the failure can be corrected prior to 300 feet AGL. 16.1.3.2.  Any failure of a required Category II component below 300 feet AGL requires the  pilot  to  execute  an  immediate  missed  approach  unless  visual  cues  are  sufficient  to complete the approach and landing. 16.1.4.  PM  will  make  appropriate  advisory  altitude  calls  on  the  approach,  including  a  call 100 feet above the DH. 16.1.4.1.  NOTE:  Tolerances  for  continuing  the  approach  from  100  feet  above  DH  are: airspeed  ±5  knots  of  computed  final  approach  speed  or  the  speed  directed  by  the  flight manual  for  Category  II  approaches,  and  deviation  from  glide  slope  and  localizer  not  to exceed one-half dot. 16.1.5.  From  100  feet  above  the  DH  to  the  Category  II  DH,  the  PM  will  concentrate primarily  on  outside  references  to  determine  if  visual  cues  are  sufficient  to  complete  the landing visually. 16.1.6.  Continue the approach at DH only if the following conditions are met: 16.1.6.1.  Runway environment (as defined in para 12.1.2.2.) is in sight. 16.1.6.2.  Airspeed  is  within  ±  5  knots  of  the  computed  final  approach  speed  or  as directed by the flight manual. 16.1.6.3.  Localizer or glide slope deviations do not exceed one-half dot. 16.1.6.4.  The  aircraft‘s  position  is  within,  and  tracking  to  remain  within,  the  extended lateral confines of the runway. 16.1.6.5.  The aircraft is stabilized with reference to attitude and airspeed.   274  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 16.1.7.  Go  around  at  DH  if  the  runway  environment  is  not  in  sight  or  if  any  of  the  above tolerances are exceeded. 16.1.7.1.  NOTE:  These  procedures  are  intended  for  use  by  Category  II  ILS  certified aircrews  only.  Individual  MAJCOM  directives  and  aircraft  manuals  have  established minimum equipment requirements and restrictions that must be complied with prior to initiating a Category II ILS approach. Figure 16.1.  Category II ILS. 16.2.  Category III ILS (Airport, Aircraft, & Aircrew Certification Required) (Figure 16.2).  16.2.1.  Definitions. 16.2.1.1.  ILS Category  III. A precision instrument approach and landing without a DH, or a DH below 100 feet (30 meters) and controlling runway visual range not less than 700 feet (240 meters). AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010   275  16.2.1.1.1.  ILS Category IIIa. An ILS approach procedure that provides for approach without a DH or RVR not less than 700 feet. 16.2.1.1.2.  ILS Category IIIb. An ILS approach procedure that provides for approach without DH and with RVR not less than 150 feet. 16.2.1.1.3.  ILS Category IIIc. An ILS approach procedure that provides for approach without DH and without RVR minimum. 16.2.1.2.  Alert Height (AH). A height defined as 100 feet above the highest elevation in the touchdown zone, above which a Category III approach would be discontinued and a missed  approach  initiated  if  a  failure  occurred  in  one  of  the  required  redundant operational  systems  in  the  airplane  or  in  the  relevant  ground  equipment.  Below  this height, the approach, flare, touchdown, and rollout may be safely accomplished following any individual failure in the associated Category III systems. 16.2.2.  Operational  Concepts.  The  weather  conditions  encountered  in  Category  III operations  range  from  adequate  visual  references  for  manual  rollout  in  Category  IIIa,  to inadequate  visual  references  even  for  taxi  operations  in  Category  IIIc.  To  maintain  a  high level  of safety during approach  and landing operations in  very low visibilities, the airborne system  and  ground  support  system  requirements  established  for  Category  III  operations should be compatible with the limited visual references that are available. The primary mode of  Category  III  operations  is  automatic  approach  to  touchdown  using  automatic  landing systems  that  does  not  require  pilot  intervention.  However,  pilot  intervention  should  be anticipated in the unlikely event that the pilot detects or strongly suspects inadequate aircraft performance as well as when it is determined that an automatic touchdown cannot be safely accomplished within the touchdown zone. 16.2.2.1.  Fail Operational Category III Operations. Aircraft certification is based on  the total  airborne  system  being  operative  down  to  AH  height  of  100  feet.  The  aircraft  will accomplish  an  automatic  landing  and  rollout  using  the  remaining  automatic  systems following failure of one system below AH. Equipment failures above AH must result in a go-around  or  reversion  to  another  approach  if  those  requirements  can  be  met.  For Category  IIIa  fail-operational  approach  and  landing  without  a  rollout  control  system, visual reference with the touchdown zone is required and should be verified prior to  the minimum  height  specified  by  the  operator  for  the  particular  aircraft  type.  These  visual cues  combined  with  controlling  transmissometer  RVR  report  of  visibility  at  or  above minima  are  necessary  to  verify  that  the  initial  landing  rollout  can  be  accomplished visually. A go-around should be accomplished if there is no visual reference prior to the specified minimum height or upon receiving a report of controlling RVR below minima prior to this height. For Category IIIa fail-operational approach and landing with a rollout control  system,  the  availability  of  visual  reference  is  not  a  specific  requirement  for continuation  of  an  approach  to  touchdown.  The  design  of  the  cockpit  instrumentation, system  comparators,  and  warning  systems  should  be  adequate  in  combination  to  assure that the pilot can verify that the aircraft will safely touchdown within the touchdown zone and safely  rollout if the controlling RVR is  reported at  or above approved minima. The aircraft  may  go-around  safely  from  any  altitude  to  touchdown.  Use  manual  go-around after touchdown.   276  AFMAN11-217V1  22 OCTOBER 2010 16.2.3.  Procedures.
