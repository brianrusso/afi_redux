(4525-A)  Weight  Allowance  Entitlement.    See  the  table  in  JTR,  par.  4510-B,  for maximum temporary duty weight allowances.  Authorization must be in the member's order to ship a specific amount (in words, figures, or both) of HHG.  However, a permanent change of station (PCS) with temporary duty (TDY) en route order (JTR par. 5284) need not contain the  specified  amount  authorized  for  shipment  unless  additional  weight  is  authorized  IAW Secretarial process contained in paragraph 2.1.2. 1.2.2.  (4525-C)  Improper Shipments.  The Joint Personal Property Shipping Office (JPPSO) or Personal Property Shipping Office (PPSO)/Personal Property Processing Office (PPPO) is responsible for determining and documenting conditions that resulted in improper shipment of  HHG  or  unavoidable  separation  of  the  HHG  from  the  member.    If  justifiable,  (J)PPSO personnel must forward the shipment to a proper destination. 1.3.  (4530)  Excess Charges.  (See paragraph 2.7. and Chapter 11) 1.4.  (4540)  PCS With TDY En Route.  (See paragraph 3.1.1.) 1.5.  (4550)  Indeterminate  TDY (ITDY).  Indeterminate  deployment  applies  when  an Airman’s deployment order does not provide for return to the PDS and the deployment is more than 20 weeks at one location, or the order does not specify or imply any limit to the period of absence from the PDS. 1.6.  (4565)  HHG Storage in Connection with TDY/Deployment. 1.6.1.  (4565-A)  Temporary  Storage.    The  Transportation  Officer  (TO)  is  designated  to authorize/approve storage under this paragraph. 1.6.2.  (4565-B2)  TDY/Deployment for 90 or More Days/An Indefinite Period. Deployment storage requires the member's commander's approval and unit O&M funding using the following criteria. 1.6.2.1.  Mission  requirement  rather  than  personal  convenience  should  be  thoroughly documented. Willingness to fund does not authorize a storage allowance. 1.6.2.2.  Storage is not authorized if the member concurrently receives BAH for housing in the commuting area of the PDS. 1.6.2.3.  A  written  approval  letter  for  storage,  or  orders/amendments  approving  storage, under this paragraph must be submitted to the (J)PPSO/PPPO and include the individual's name  and  grade,  anticipated  duration  of  the  TDY,  Special  Order  Number,  unit's Operations and Maintenance AFI24-501  10 OCTOBER 2014   9  (O&M) Line of Accounting (LOA), TDY purpose, rationale for storage, and concurrence of the individual's Wing, Group or Squadron Commander. 1.6.3.  The member's unit O&M funds are to be used to effect storage under this paragraph.  Storage at Government expense terminates not later than 90 days after TDY completion.  A member's  request  for  additional  storage  must  have  endorsement  by  the  member's commander.    The  TDY  or  deployment  period  need  not  be  at  just  one  location.    However, multiple  TDY  assignments  or  deployment  for  more  than  90  days  must  be  consecutive  to qualify for this storage.   10  AFI24-501  10 OCTOBER 2014 Chapter 2 HHG TRANSPORTATION AND NTS 2.1.  (5172)  AUTHORIZED TRANSPORTATION. 2.1.1.  (5172-A)  General.  When members exhaust their JTR weight allowance, shipment of additional weight at Government expense or by Government arrangement is PROHIBITED.  However, if the maximum Government obligation has been exceeded but the member has not exceeded their weight allowance, shipment of remaining entitlement is subject to excess cost. 2.1.1.1.  (5172-D)  Subsequent  HHG  Transportation  (Combination  of  Orders).  After issuance of a new PCS order, entitlements under a prior PCS order cease to  the current permanent duty station, except as provided in JTR, paragraph 5172-D.  This procedure is often referred to  as a “Combination of Orders” shipment.  Such shipments may only be made  from  a  former  duty  station  or  authorized  point  to  which  previously  shipped  at Government expense.  The household goods must have been acquired before the effective date of all orders used in the combination of orders. The authorized weight allowance is the  unused  balance  in  effect  on  the  effective  date  of  the  previous  orders  (See  example provided  in  5172-E).  The  appropriate  shipping  document  must  be  annotated  to  show "Paying Officer Review Requested”. Example:  Member is ordered from Beale AFB to Offutt AFB. Member’s JTR prescribed weight allowance under that order is: 12,000 lbs. Member actually ships from Beale to Offutt: 7000 lbs. Unused balance is: 5,000 lbs. Member is subsequently ordered from Offutt AFB to Hanscom AFB, MA. Member’s new JTR prescribed weight allowance under that order is: 13,000 lbs. Member may ship 13,000 lbs. to Hanscom AFB; 5,000 lbs. of that weight may be shipped from Beale AFB to Hanscom AFB using a combination of the order to Offutt AFB and the order to Hanscom AFB provided documentation can validate such the previous shipped HHG remaining balance.  2.1.2.  (5200)  Prescribed Weight  Allowances.  Requests for  exception under this paragraph IAW  5200-A  may  be  submitted  after  receipt  of  excess  weight  notification,  and  after  the rebuttal  and  remission  of  debt  process  is  complete.  The  member  must  justify  a  significant financial hardship is experienced.  The Secretarial process to request an exception is through the servicing MPS to AF/A1PA. 2.1.2.1.  Permanent Change of Station (PCS): 2.1.2.1.1.  Within the CONUS, full JTR weight allowance is authorized. 2.1.2.1.2.  To,  From,  and  Between  OCONUS  Areas.    HHG  shipment  weight allowances are subject  to JTR administrative limitations.  Refer to  the JTR,  APP W for overseas weight restrictions. (See paragraph 2.2. and Attachments 2 and 3) AFI24-501  10 OCTOBER 2014   11  Note:  Full JTR weight allowance is authorized upon return from OCONUS for retiring or separating members. 2.1.3.  (5268)  Adjudicating  Professional  Books,  Papers,  and  Equipment  (PBP&E)  for    a Member and a Member’s Dependent Spouse.  (See Attachment 9) 2.1.3.1.  See  PBP&E  definition  for  member  or  employee  and  a  member’s  dependent spouse  in  JTR,  Appendix  A.    Homeschool  supplies  and  equipment  do  not  qualify  as spouse PBP&E. If an entitlement to NTS exists, NTS is authorized for both the PBP&E for the member and the  PBP&E for his/her dependent  spouse when one or both  are not required at the member’s next PDS. 2.1.3.2.  During counseling, a member must be informed of the importance of declaring PBP&E for himself/herself as well as for a dependent spouse.  The declaration of PBP&E for a member’s dependent spouse is NTE 500 pounds.  Although members may indicate they  will  not  exceed  their  HHG  or  unaccompanied  baggage  weight  allowance,  it  is incumbent upon the (J)PPSO/PPPO to ensure compliance with the following: 2.1.3.2.1.  If  incomplete  applications  are  received,  shipment  is  not  delayed  provided the member's desires are not questionable and shipments are otherwise authorized. 2.1.3.2.2.  Entry  in  the  remarks  section  of  the  DD  Form  1299  should  read  “PBP&E FOR SPOUSE” followed by the estimated weight (NTE 500 pounds).  Document DD Form  1299  to  include  spouse’s  employment/occupation  or  community  support activities at the next or later destination. Note: Reemphasize that in making such a declaration, later consideration for PBP&E is not given unless the member qualifies for the “after-the-fact” approval identified below. 2.1.3.2.3.  When  a  member  declares  PBP&E  for  himself/herself  and/or  for  a dependent  spouse,  it  acts  as  certification  that  those  items  are  necessary  in  the performance of their official duties.  Such items must meet the criteria of PBP&E for a member and the criteria of PBP&E for a member’s dependent spouse as defined in JTR,  Appendix  A,  and  other  provisions  contained  herein.    Members  are  to  be counseled that the burden of proof, if challenged, rests with them. 2.1.3.2.4.  A  distinct  separation  of  PBP&E  for  a  member  and  a  dependent  spouse must be made.  PBP&E must be separately packed, marked with the word “M-PRO” for the member and “S-PRO” for the dependent spouse, inventoried and weighed.  In addition, a clear description of the articles along with an annotation as to the type of PBP&E (“M-PRO” or “S-PRO”) must be entered on the HHG inventory prepared at the  time  of  pickup.    If  a  clear  description  is  not  evident,  credit  will  not  be  granted unless  verified  under  paragraph  2.1.3.2.5.    If  it  isn’t  possible  or  practical  to  weigh PBP&E at origin, the constructive weight of 7 pounds per cubic foot described in the JTR,  par  5204-E  applies.    In  either  event,  actual  or  constructive  weights  of  each inventoried item must be entered on the inventory.  When certified scale weights are obtained for PBP&E, that weight must be used. 2.1.3.2.5.  After-the-Fact verification of PBP&E can only be accepted when a review of  the  member’s  case  file  contains  documented  intent  to  declare  PBP&E  for himself/herself and/or a dependent spouse.  Documented intent includes declaring an   12  AFI24-501  10 OCTOBER 2014 estimated  weight  entered  on  DD  Form  1299,  or  separately  identified,  marked,  and inventoried during the move in question as per paragraph 2.1.3.2.4.  When a member declares  PBP&E  but  fails  to  have  the  Transportation  Service  Provider  (TSP)  record and weigh the items, credit may be given if the (J)PPSO/PPPO documents the items and  weight  upon  delivery,  or  review  the  inventory  to  make  a  determination.  Verification  must  be  at  the  time  of,  or  immediately  after  delivery  and  prior  to unpacking  of  the  PBP&E.    This  process  is  only  to  give  credit  to  those  cases  that obviously completed all actions of declaration except that the TSP failed to annotate the  GBL/BL.    The  (J)PPSO/PPPO  can  use  actual  weight  or  construct  weight  of    7 pounds  per  cubic  foot.    See  Attachment  9.

Military Affiliate Radio Station (MARS) Equipment (Applies only to members): 2.1.3.3.1.  To  qualify  for  shipment  or  storage  of  MARS  equipment  at  Government expense, members must present a completed MARS certificate.  (See Attachment 5). 2.1.3.3.2.  When  members  are  assigned  OCONUS  where  a  MARS  operation  is authorized, NTS or shipment to other than new duty station is prohibited. 2.1.3.3.3.  When members are assigned OCONUS where individual MARS operation is  not  authorized (See Attachment 5 and Personal  Property Consignment Instruction Guide  (PPCIG))  shipment  OCONUS  or  within  CONUS  is  prohibited.    Under  these circumstances,  the  member  is  authorized  to  store  MARS  equipment  in  Non-temporary storage for the duration of the OCONUS tour. 2.1.3.3.4.  Storage of MARS equipment incident to JTR, pars. 5288, 5320, 5318, and 5224 is authorized. 2.1.3.4.  Air Force Band Equipment (Applies only to members): 2.1.3.4.1.  To qualify band equipment as PBP&E, the member must provide a written statement,  signed  by  the  local  band  commander,  certifying  such  equipment  is PBP&E.  Following is a suggested statement:  “I certify (member's name and rank) is a  member  of  the  Air  Force  Band  and  possesses  the  appropriate  AFSC.    I  further certify  the  band  equipment  to  be  (shipped)  (stored)  as  professional  equipment  is necessary in the performance of official duties." 2.1.3.4.2.  Pianos  and  organs  may  qualify  as  PBP&E.    The  local  band  commander must  also  add  the  following  remark  in  the  written  statement  for  such  items  to  be shipped as PBP&E:  "Member is an arranger, piano or organ player, or both." 2.1.3.4.3.  Personal stereo equipment and associated media are not PBP&E. 2.1.4.  (5274)  Additional  Consumable  Goods.    See  par.  9.3  for  description  of  consumable goods. 2.1.4.1.  The use of extra HHG pickup provisions to pick up consumable goods directly from base commissaries or commercial grocery stores is permitted. AFI24-501  10 OCTOBER 2014   13  2.1.5.  (5176)  Government-Paid  Expenses.    Services  provided  for  shipment  or  storage  of such  items  is  limited  to  those  provided  under  TSP’s  tariffs  or  contractual  provisions.  Nothing  in  the  law  (Title  37,  United  States  Code)  or  implementing  directives  provides  that the  Government  furnishes  extraordinary  or  special  services  when  shipping  expensive  and valuable items.  If a member requests exceptional packing and crating services, the member is responsible for all costs for those services. 2.1.6.  (5190)  Transportation of Replacement HHG Items.  The Transportation Officer is the approval authority for this provision. 2.2.  (5202)  Administrative Weight Limitations:  (See Attachment 2 and 3.) 2.2.1.  (5202-A)  General: 2.2.1.1.  Unaccompanied  members  assigned  to,  from,  and  between  OCONUS  areas (including Alaska and Hawaii) are limited to  HHG weight  allowances in  Attachment 3, Table A3.1. (APP W) 2.2.1.2.  Review  JTR,  APP  W,  in  order  to  identify  restricted  weight  areas  for accompanied  members  assigned  to,  from,  and  between  certain  OCONUS  areas.  Exceptions to the administrative weight limitations are listed in Attachment 2, Table A2.1 and must be included on PCS orders. 2.2.1.3.  Air  Force  policy  is  that  members  assigned  to  restricted  areas  generally  remain weight restricted on departure from the area even if the weight restriction is lifted while the member is still assigned to that area.  The establishment of an effective date for the policy change is designed to apply prospectively, not retroactively.  Therefore, across-the-board approval of full JTR weight shipments cannot be authorized for these personnel.  However, requests for additional weight can be considered on a case-by-case basis under the provisions of Attachments 2 and 3, Tables A2.1 and A3.1. 2.2.1.4.  All  accompanied  Air  Force  members/employees  HHG  shipments  to  or  from Kadena AB, Yokota AB, and Misawa AB picked up on or after 1 Mar 08 are authorized full JTR weight entitlement. 2.2.2.  (5202-E)  Exceptions.  Exceptions in Attachment 2 and 3, Table A2.1  and A3.1 may apply.  The Military Personnel Section (MPS) annotates the authorized weight exceptions in member’s special order. 2.3.  (5174)  Re-Transportation of the Same HHG: 2.3.1.  Member’s  Convenience.    Reshipment  of  the  same  property  on  one  PCS  order  is  not authorized  at  Government  expense  after  delivery  to  member/employee.    Reshipment  of  the TDY weight allowance from TDY location to TDY location to new PDS is authorized. 2.3.1.1.  Delivery  from  storage  is  not  synonymous  with  the  term  reshipment.    A  long delivery from  storage  (Storage  In Transit (SIT) or NTS) can be made to  an alternate or different  destination  for  the  member’s  convenience.    The  member  must  agree  to  be financially responsible for the excess cost for the distance exceeding delivery within the commander’s  authorized  local  (delivery)  area  (See  paragraph  9.5).    This  applies  to  a member  who  selects  a  city  to  live  in  and  has  their  HHG  shipped  to  that  city  and  then   14  AFI24-501  10 OCTOBER 2014 decides to move to another location outside the local delivery area or if the shipment cost exceeds the remaining maximum transportation obligation. 2.4.  (5210)  Transportation Methods. 2.4.1.  (5210-A)  HHG: 2.4.1.1.  CONUS:  Shipment is by surface mode. 2.4.1.2.  OCONUS:  Normally, shipment is made by a surface mode except to and  from “Hardlift  areas”  (Attachment  7),  Transportation  Priority  4  (TP-4)  areas,  or  when authorized  or  approved  under  the  provisions  of  paragraph  10.6.    Shipments  to  Hardlift areas, TP-4 areas, and those approved for airlift are always to be moved with preference given to AMC. 2.4.1.3.  Note:  (1)  Space  required  airlift  of  HHG  including  airlift  to  “Hardlift  areas”  is not authorized for retirees or separatees.  (2) There is no TP-4 capability for inter-theater shipments  (i.e.,  EUCOM  to  PACOM);  however,  TP-2  is  available  (reference  paragraph 10.6.3.) 2.4.2.  (5210-B)  Unaccompanied Baggage (UB). 2.4.2.1.  Between Points within CONUS:  Normally, UB is included with the HHG if the transit time satisfies the member’s needs.  HHG shipped in this manner is identified to the TSP  as  “designated  items  for  extra  pickup  or  delivery.”    One  GBL  is  issued  and annotated “Extra Pick Up and/or Extra Delivery Authorized.”  The TSP must inventory, load  and  store  designated  items  to  permit  ready  access  at  destination.    Expedited  mode (for  the  JTR-limited  amount  of  UB)  may  be  used  when  the  transit  time  of  the  HHG shipment  does  not  meet  the  required  delivery  date  for  UB.    This  also  applies  when  the only shipment is UB.  (See paragraph 5.1.6.) 2.4.2.2.  To,  From,  or  Between  Points  OCONUS:    See  the  PPCIG  for  routing/mode.  Separate  shipments  of  UB  to,  from,  and  between  Hardlift  areas  are  not  authorized  for dependents  or  members  when  concurrent  travel  of  dependents  is  authorized.    Separate shipment  is  authorized  when  required  due  to  host  country  restrictions.    Review  PPCIG (Overseas). 2.4.2.3.  UB  weight  entitlement  is  determined  by  adding  member  and/or  dependent authorized weight  IAW Attachment 4 Table A4.1.  However, per JTR, par. 5172-H  the maximum  weight  of  UB  transported  by  any  mode  at  Government  expense  is  2,000  lbs. (net), excluding the weight of PBP&E, if PBP&E is transported with UB. 2.4.2.4.   Note:  UB is part of the administrative HHG weight limitation. 2.4.3.  (5210-D)  Personally Procured Transportation & NTS.  (See Chapter 12) 2.5.  (5208)  Factors Affecting HHG Transportation. 2.5.1.  (5208-A)  Combining  Weight  Allowances  When  Husband  and  Wife  are  Both Members.    When  a  military  member  is  married  to  another  military  member,  neither  can  be counted as being a dependent of the other to increase any allowance including HHG weight.  If  no  other  dependent  exists,  both  are  members  without  dependents  in  determining  weight allowance. AFI24-501  10 OCTOBER 2014   15  2.5.1.1.  When  both  members  are  assigned  to  or  from  an  OCONUS  duty  station unaccompanied, they each are limited to the unaccompanied member weight allowance. 2.5.1.2.  When both members are assigned either to or from a different weight restricted OCONUS  duty  station  accompanied,  both  members  are  authorized  to  ship  their maximum  restricted  weight  allowance  combined  or  separately.    The  combined  weight allowance may be divided between the two members provided neither exceeds the weight allowance prescribed for their grade.  Any shipment  exceeding the authorized weight  is subject to excess cost.  If both members are assigned to the same PDS, or nearby PDS in the same area at which they jointly occupy a residence, and their new orders are both to the  same  PDS/joint  residence,  the  members  are  limited  to  one  administrative  weigh allowance based on the higher ranking member’s weight allowance. 2.5.1.3.  When  both  members  are  assigned  to  or  from  OCONUS  duty  station accompanied, they are each authorized full JTR weight entitlement. 2.5.1.4.  Once  the  HHG  have  been  shipped  to  the  authorized  PDS  under  one  member’s entitlement,  the  Government’s  statutory  and  regulatory  obligation  to  the  member  has been met.  Further movement of the same HHG under the other member’s orders is not authorized (54 Comp. Gen. B-181402, 10 April 1975). 2.5.1.5.  Military  member  married  to  a  civilian  employee.    The  civilian  employee,  if under a PCS order, is authorized appropriate JTR entitlements.  The member may also be authorized HHG shipment under a PCS order.  Both persons cannot be paid for the same expenses.    Exception  is  only  one  administrative  weight  allowance  is  authorized  if  the couple  are  PCS  from  the  same  location  and  to  the  same  location  IAW  JTR,  par.  5202-C2a. 2.5.2.  (5208-B)  Improper Transportation.  The (J)PPSO/PPPO is assigned responsibility for determining  and  documenting  conditions  which  result  in  improper  shipment  (property erroneously  shipped  at  no  fault  of  the  member)  or  unavoidable  separation  of  the  property from the member.  If justifiable, (J)PPSO personnel must forward the shipment to the proper destination and provide a copy of the shipment justification to PPA HQ/ECAF, 2261 Hughes Avenue,  Ste  159,  Lackland  AFB,  TX  78236-9857,  email:    hqppa.ecaf-adj@us.af.mil,  fax:  (210) 321-4262. (See paragraph 2.3. and JTR, par. 5234). 2.5.3.  (5208-C)  Items of Extraordinary Value. 2.5.3.1.  Members  contemplating  shipment  of  expensive  and  valuable  items  must  be counseled: 2.5.3.1.1.  If  maximum  claim  amount  provides  inadequate  settlement,  members should be advised to obtain commercial insurance. 2.5.3.1.2.  Members  should  hand-carry  valuables  such  as  jewelry,  watches,  cameras, currency, and other items subject to pilferage. 2.5.4.  (5208-D5)  HHG Removed from Mobile Home to Meet Safety Requirements.  Excess items should be removed upon the recommendation of the commercial TSP when based on the  condition  of  the  mobile  home.    The  member  must  provide  the  (J)PPSO/PPPO  with  a written  copy  of  the  TSP’s  assessment  when  applying  for  HHG  shipment  under  this paragraph.   16  AFI24-501  10 OCTOBER 2014 2.5.5.  (5208-E1)  General.    A  Letter-in-  Lieu-of-Order  is  issued  by  the  PCS  orders  issuing authority.  (J)PPSO/PPPO  personnel  must  retain  the  member's  written  agreement  to  be financially responsible for the shipment as well as the Letter-in-Lieu-of-Order and establish a suspense file of 60 days to ensure orders are received.  If the PPSO/PPPO does not receive the  order  within  60  days,  the  PPSO/PPPO  inquires  with  the  MPS.    If  an  order  has  not  and will  not  be  issued,  PPPOs  will  notify  JPPSO  to  initiate  billing  action  (DD  Form  139,  Pay Adjustment Authorization) against the member and forward to DFAS. 2.5.5.1.  A Letter-in-Lieu-of-Order must contain an accounting classification. 2.5.5.2.  A Letter-in-Lieu-of-Order cannot be issued for a separatee or retiree. 2.5.5.3.  A member without dependents, stationed in CONUS, pending discharge because of non-judicial punishment is not authorized to use “Letter-in-Lieu-of-Order.” 2.5.5.4.  A  member  who  moves  HHG  at  personal  expense  prior  to  the  issuance  of  an order or a “Letter-in-Lieu-of-Order” is not entitled to reimbursement. 2.6.  (5204)  The Net Weight Determination.  (See Attachment 8) 2.6.1.  (5204-F)  Exceptions. 2.6.1.1.  In  any  case  where  the  outer  container  is  the  member's  "personal"  property,  no packing adjustment is authorized. 2.6.1.2.  The  Transportation  Officer  (TO)  is  designated  to  approve  a  change  of  the  net weight of shipments.  This is allowed only when a shipment is completely unpacked and weight  of  packing  materials  is  verified.    The  actual  weight  of  the  packing  materials  is then subtracted from the TSP/contractor's net weight. 2.6.1.3.  Note:  A packing allowance as prescribed in Attachment 8 is not authorized after weighing in this manner. 2.7.  (5206)  Excess Charges.  (See Chapter 11 for Responsibilities and Procedures) 2.7.1.  (5206-G)  NTS. 2.7.1.1.  Charges  for  excess  HHG  weight  in  Government  NTS  facilities  are  paid  by  the Government  and  charged  to  the  member.    Charges  include  preparation,  drayage, handling,  and  storage.      JPPSOs  are  not  to  bill  members  unless  advised  by  PPA HQ/ECAF. 2.7.1.2.  Excess  HHG  weight  in  commercial  Non-temporary  Storage  (NTS)  facilities.  When  excess  weight  situations  become  known,  (J)PPSOs  should  not  convert  the overweight portion of these lots to the member's account unless advised to do so by PPA HQ/ECAF. 2.7.1.3.  PPA  HQ/ECAF  determines  which  shipment  (HHG,  NTS,  UB,  etc.)  the  excess weight and costs are attributable.  When computation of excess weight on NTS shipments result in the least excess cost to the member and the member requested the Government to pay the excess costs in the DD Form 1299 Remarks Section, PPA HQ/ECAF sends the member a letter offering two payment options.  The member may (1) immediately pay all storage  costs  (based  on  the  tour  length  reflected  on  the  special  order)  for  the  excess weight  stored,  or  (2)  defer  payment  of  the  excess  costs  until  the  lot  is  withdrawn  from AFI24-501  10 OCTOBER 2014   17  NTS.    A  copy  of  this  letter  is  provided  to  the  (J)PPSO.    Considering  the  members selection,  PPA  HQ/ECAF  (1)  issues  a  DD  Form  139  and  subsequently  provides  a corrected DD Form 139 if the actual storage time-frame differs from the anticipated tour length,  or  (2)  provides  a  DD  Form  139  once  the  property  is  removed  from  NTS  or remains in NTS under a new special order. 2.7.1.4.  Provide  copies  or  ensure  the  member’s  NTS  documentation  (DD  Form  1164, DD  Form  1299,  special  order,  weight  tickets,  etc.)  are  available  to  PPA HQ/ECAF  and provide copies  or ensure the new line-haul or local drayage weight tickets are available. 2.7.1.5.  The above procedures result in lower excess cost payment for affected members because  they  pay  the  lower  Government  storage  rate  rather  than  the  higher  commercial storage rate. 2.7.2.  (5206-H)  HHG  Transportation  in  Excess  of  Authorized  Weight  Allowance.    Excess cost  includes  accessorial  preparation,  drayage,  warehouse  handling,  storage,  line  haul,  port handling, and MSC or AMC charge (if applicable).  Transportation counselors will annotate in  the  counseling  module  of  Defense  Personal  Property  System  (DPS)  “Paying  Officer Review.” 2.7.3.  (5206-I)  HHG Transportation Other Than Between Authorized Locations.  Members contemplating  shipment  of HHG other than between  authorized locations should always be advised of possible excess cost.  Excess costs may occur even if the distance is  LESS than the  distance  between  authorized  locations.  Annotate  in  the  counseling  module  of  DPS “Paying Officer Review.” 2.7.4.  (5206-J)  Transportation  of  Unauthorized  Articles.    The  member  pays  all  expenses between any locations for unauthorized articles. See Definition of HHG in Appendix A of the JTR for a listing of unauthorized articles. Annotate in the counseling module of DPS “Paying Officer Review.” 2.7.5.  (5206-K)  HHG Transportation with Special Routing or Services Provided. 2.7.5.1.  Higher  Cost  Mode  Specifically  Requested  by  Member.    Excess  cost  is  the difference between the mode normally selected by the JPPSO and the mode requested by the member. 2.7.5.2.  Special  Services.    Special  services  not  provided  under  normal  rates  can  be requested by and furnished to the member.  These include premium packing and crating not otherwise required by a TSP to protect an item.  The excess cost includes the cost of the special services. 2.7.5.3.  The  member  may  request  final  shipment  of  the  property  legally  awarded  to  an ex-spouse  incident  to  a  divorce.    The  decision  on  whether  or  not  to  use  the  PCS allowance for this purpose rests solely with the member.  The shipment is authorized on the  current  order  provided  the  property  was  not  previously  shipped  on  that  order  and  a shipping entitlement still exists.  Otherwise, the member must be in possession of a new PCS order before property may  be shipped.  Annotate in  the counseling  module of DPS “Paying Officer Review”.   18  AFI24-501  10 OCTOBER 2014 2.7.5.4.    Note:    Member  is  only  entitled  to  ship  to  new  duty  station,  or  other  authorized location (e.g., designated place if unaccompanied tour, HOR if separation) any other location is subject to excess cost. AFI24-501  10 OCTOBER 2014   19  Chapter 3 TRANSPORTATION UNDER VARIOUS TYPES OF PCS ORDERS 3.1.  Transportation Under Various Types of Situations. 3.1.1.  (5284)  PCS  with  TDY  En  Route,  PCS  While  on  TDY,  or  PCS  Following  TDY Pending  Further  Assignment:    Approval  for  shipment  of  HHG  up  to  the  TDY  weight allowance does not have to  be included in  the PCS order for the member to  be eligible for shipment to the TDY location(s). 3.1.1.1.  (5284-A)  The  PCS  line  of  accounting  will  be  used  for  all  shipments  except NTS. 3.1.1.2.  Encourage the  member to  always exercise the entitlement to  NTS for the TDY period.  This  reduces the possibility for excess costs.  It also provides the member with temporary storage entitlement at the new PDS upon completion of the TDY. 3.1.2.  (5292-B)  Ordered  from  OCONUS  PDS. processing may use the AF Form 899 (PCS Order) to:   Members  returning  for  separation 3.1.2.1.  Place property in NTS. 3.1.2.2.  Ship  unaccompanied  baggage  or  HHG  directly  to  a  location  in  the  CONUS.    Destination may be beyond the processing station only if the AF Form 899 contains the "home  of  record"  or  "place  of  entry  into  the  service"  or  “place  last  entered  on  active duty."    It  must  also  include  the  point  to  which  such  travel  is  intended.    Shipments exceeding  the  authorized  weight  or  distance  are  subject  to  the  advance  collection procedures described in JTR par. 5206 and Chapter 11 of this supplement. 3.1.2.3.  Shipment from Non-temporary storage is not authorized until the final separation order (AF Form 100) is issued. 3.1.3.  (5292-C)  Ordered  from  OCONUS  PDS  to  the  U.S.  or  to  a  Non-foreign  OCONUS Area  for  Separation  Processing  with  HOS  Authorized.    Encourage  a  member  returning  for retirement processing to always exercise the entitlement to NTS unless they believe they are going  to  retire  in  the  vicinity  of  the  processing  station  or  will  require  a  partial  release  to establish  a  residence.    However,  the  member  must  bear  any  excess  cost  for  HHG  that  are delivered at the processing station and later shipped to the members HOS. 3.2.  (5296)  PCS  Transportation  to  or  From  Sea  Duty  (Not  Unusually  Arduous)  or OCONUS Duty. 3.2.1.  (5296-A1)  Ordered to an OCONUS PDS to Which HHG Transportation Is Permitted.  The member may elect to ship HHG to a designated location limited in cost to a shipment to the OCONUS PDS (see JTR par. 5264-A1 for exact language) or place the HHG into NTS.  No further shipment at Government expense, of the same property, is authorized until a new PCS  order  is  issued.    Upon  subsequent  PCS  to  another  duty  station  outside  CONUS, shipment  from  the  designated  location  or  Non-temporary  storage  to  the  new  consecutive OCONUS  tour  PDS  requires  prior  approval.    The  member’s  gaining  MPS  is  designated  to authorize and/or approve these shipments.  See JTR, par. 5194, item 7 for time limitations.   20  AFI24-501  10 OCTOBER 2014 3.2.2.  (5296-A2)  Ordered to an OCONUS PDS to Which HHG Transportation Is to Be Authorized within 20 Weeks of Member’s Port Reporting Month.  HHG shipments may be  sent  directly  to  the  OCONUS  permanent  duty  station  when  authorized/approved  by HQ  USAF/A4LR  via  MAJCOM.    Criteria  for  approval  includes:  the  member’s acceptable written justification, copy of the member’s PCS order, and the estimated cost of storage and transit time. 3.2.2.1.    (5296-A3d)  Shipment  of  HHG  from  NTS  will  not  be  allowed  until  receipt  of dependent entry approval is provided and that the dependents are to be command sponsored and  the  member  has  at  least  12  months  remaining  on  the  OCONUS  tour  on  the  date  the dependents are scheduled to arrive. 3.2.3.  (5296-C)  Ordered  from  a  CONUS  PDS  to  an  OCONUS  PDS  to  Which  HHG Transportation  Is  Prohibited  or  Restricted,  to  Unusually  Arduous  Sea  Duty,  or  Duty  Under Unusual  Circumstances.    If  dependent  travel  is  not  involved,  MAJCOM  commanders  are designated to authorize and/or approve shipments.  This authority may be delegated to MPS.  APPROVAL  CRITERIA:    Because  Non-temporary  storage  is  authorized  at  Government expense  in  lieu  of  shipment  (JTR,  par.  5216),  shipment  to  a  designated  location  OCONUS should  not  be  authorized  when  dependent  travel  is  not  applicable  unless  the  HHG  are intended for use at the OCONUS destination by dependents as defined in JTR, Appendix A who  are  already  located  at  that  point;  or  the  member  states  in  writing  the  intention  to establish  a  residence  at  that  place  upon  separation  or  retirement  after  completion  of  the current OCONUS tour of duty (See JTR, par. 5318). 3.2.3.1.  Single  members  and  members  serving  an  "ALL  OTHERS"  (dependents  not authorized) tour are limited to the applicable unaccompanied baggage allowance.  These allowances are shown in Attachment 4, Table A4.1, and applicable notes.  Exceptions to these weight allowances are listed in Attachment 3, Table A3.1. 3.2.3.2.  To  participate  in  both  the  "Follow-on"  and  "Home  Basing"  assignment programs,  members  agree  to  certain  conditions.    The  conditions  include  voluntary member  decisions  on  shipment  and  storage  of  HHG,  and  movement  of  dependents  at Government expense.  CAUTION:  A member participating in either program may still exercise the JTR allowances to ship and store HHG.  Questions on whether a particular action impacts the follow-on assignment should be resolved between the member and the MPS. 3.2.3.2.1.  An  order  to  a  restricted  or  remote  assignment  may  identify  either  the foreign  and/or  CONUS  follow-on  location.    This  order  is  not  the  authority  for movement  of  HHG  to  the  foreign  OCONUS  follow-on  points.  The  letter  from  the gaining MPS is evidence that the SOFA agreement and customs have been approved by the follow-on location.  A separate order specifically authorizing shipment to the foreign  OCONUS  follow-on  location  is  required.    The  PPCIG  must  be  carefully checked  on  HHG  shipments  to  OCONUS  locations  for  unaccompanied  dependents.  EXCEPTIONS to  utilize  PCS  allowances  and  receive  advance  assignment consideration are: 3.2.3.2.2.  Relocation of dependents  and/or HHG  are authorized to  the CONUS/Non foreign OCONUS follow-on location ONLY. AFI24-501  10 OCTOBER 2014   21  Note:  HHG should not be shipped to the follow-on location at Government expense unless the member or the member’s agent can accept HHG delivery upon HHG arrival at the follow-on location.  A period of SIT not to exceed 90 days may be authorized, as it is the intent of this program for the dependents to establish a residence at the follow-on location. 3.2.3.2.3.  Single  members,  single  member  parents,  or  either  spouse  of  a  member-married-to-member couple, who are to serve concurrent, but separate, unaccompanied short tours, can store HHG at Government expense. 3.2.3.2.4.  If  denied  continued  occupancy  of  Government  owned/controlled  quarters or  privatized  housing,  dependents  and  HHG  may  be  moved  (local  move  only)  as prescribed by JTR, par. 5262. 3.2.4.  (5296-D2c)  .  Ordered from an OCONUS PDS to an OCONUS PDS to Which HHG Transportation  Is  Prohibited  or  Restricted,  or  Duty  Under  Unusual  Circumstances.    If dependent travel is not involved, MAJCOM commanders are designated to authorize/approve shipments.  This authority may be delegated to MPS. 3.2.4.1.  APPROVAL  CRITERIA:    Because  Non-temporary  storage  is  authorized  at Government  expense  in  lieu  of  shipment  (JTR,  par.  5216),  shipment  to  a  designated location  OCONUS  should  not  be  authorized  when  dependent  travel  is  not  applicable unless: 3.2.4.2.  HHG intended for use at the OCONUS destination by bona fide dependents who are already located at the point; or the member states in writing the intention to establish a  residence  at  that  place  upon  separation  or  retirement  after  completion  of  the  current OCONUS tour of duty (See JTR, par. 5318).  The PPCIG must be carefully checked on shipments of HHG to OCONUS locations for unaccompanied dependents. 3.2.5.  (5216-D2d)  Ordered  from  an  OCONUS  PDS  to  an  OCONUS  PDS  to  Which Transportation  Is  Prohibited  or  Restricted,  or  Duty  Under  Unusual  Circumstances.  MAJCOM  Commanders  are  designated  to  authorize/approve  shipments  of  HHG  to  any location outside the CONUS in situations other than described above. 3.2.5.1.  APPROVAL  CRITERIA.  Dependent location  must  be authorized/ approved under JTR, par. 5120 or a dependent must already be residing at the OCONUS  location.    The  PPCIG  must  be  carefully  checked  on  shipments  of  HHG  to OCONUS locations for unaccompanied dependents. to  such travel 3.2.6.  (5296-E)  Ordered from Sea Duty or OCONUS Duty to a CONUS PDS: 3.2.6.1.  Shipment  of HHG from OCONUS  areas other than the official  OCONUS  duty station  is  permitted.    The  term  “HOUSEHOLD  GOODS”  does  not  include  articles "acquired" AFTER the effective date of orders.  For new furniture shipments,  the items must  be  manufactured  and  owned  before  the  effective  date  of  orders  to  qualify  for shipment by Government arrangement. 3.2.6.2.  The member, prior to departure from the OCONUS PDS, must sign a DD Form 1299 agreeing to be responsible for all additional costs resulting from such shipments. 3.2.6.3.  PPSO/PPPOs  do  not  forward  the  application  if  the  member  exceeded  the  full JTR  weight  allowance  by  previous  shipments.    When  administrative  weight  limitations are exceeded, members are to be counseled that OCONUS costs are a personal financial   22  AFI24-501  10 OCTOBER 2014 responsibility.    The  full  JTR  weight  allowance  applies  for  the  CONUS  portion  of  the shipment. 3.3.  (5258)  Local Short Distance Moves. 3.3.1.  (5258)  General.  The local short distance move area is not defined by the local move contract in place. 3.3.1.1.  (5260-B)  Short Distance Moves Incident to Reassignment or PCS: 3.3.2.1.  HHG movement between activities at the same PDS, or PCS between PDS located in proximity requires the member to obtain the gaining installation commander approval.  The commander certifies in writing the member’s specific circumstance that requires HHG movement as a mission essential requirement, is in the Government’s best interest, and is not primarily for the member's convenience.  A member’s desire to reside closer to the new duty station does not qualify for HHG movement. 3.3.2.2.  PCS  Code  V  (Low-Cost):  When  authorized  by  the  gaining  installation commander, members requesting a low-cost move are authorized only a HHG shipment consisting of Professional Books, Papers, and Equipment (PBP&E) from current PDS to new PDS, NTE $1,000 in total PCS costs, as outlined in AFMAN 65-604. Use the PCS appropriation contained on the travel orders. 3.3.2.3.  PCS Code M (No-Cost): No-cost moves are not authorized HHG nor a PBP&E shipment. 3.3.2.4.  All other PCS Codes: PCS Codes other than M and V, are authorized complete HHG movement in connection with a local proximity move when the gaining installation commander  certifies  in  writing  the  member’s  specific  circumstance  that  requires  HHG movement as a mission essential requirement, is in the Government’s best interest, and is not  primarily  for  the  member's  convenience.    A  member’s  desire  to  reside  closer  to  the new  duty  station  does  not  qualify  for  HHG  movement.  Use  the  PCS  appropriation contained on the travel orders. 3.3.2.5.  Prior  to  arranging  HHG  movement,  retain  a  copy  of  the  commander’s certification memo in the member's file. 3.3.3.  (5260-C)  PCS between PDSs Located in Proximity.  Temporary storage for Inter-city moves under JTR, par. 5260 may be authorized in par. 5248-B. 3.3.4.  (5262)  Short  Distance  Move  and  NTS  Incident  to  Government  or  Government-Controlled Quarters Assignment/Termination.  (See paragraph 5.2.5.1.) Member’s separating or  retiring  are  limited  to  their  weight  allowance  in  par.  5200.    Neither  the  member's  PCS weight  allowance nor the 18,000-pound limit imposed by 37 USC §476(b)(1)(D) applies to members vacating Government/privatized housing prior to declaring a Home of Selection or Home of Record under par. 5318-G or 5320-F. 3.3.4.1.  (5262)  Moving  To/From  Government  Quarters.    The  Air  Force  has  a  vested interest  to  ensure  maximum  utilization  of  Government  and  privatized  housing.  Local moves under this paragraph are considered "directed" in nature when the move fulfills a legitimate  Service  requirement,  such  as  occupying  idle  Government/privatized  quarters.  The fact that a member volunteers to move does NOT make the move of the “member’s AFI24-501  10 OCTOBER 2014   23  convenience” if the move fulfills a Government requirement of filling a vacant unit.  Per AFI  32-6001,  Housing  Management  determines  when  assignment  to  housing  is  strictly for a member's convenience. 3.3.4.2.  Do not deny a local move solely because of lack of funds. In the event a shortage of local drayage funds limits potential assignment and move into Government/privatized housing,  such  moves  are  considered  "must  pay"  and  installations  follow  the  normal budgeting process to request additional funding.  Members are not to be denied the JTR allowance of a Government  funded move, nor be required to  fund a local  move at  their expense. 3.3.5.  (5264)  Short Distance Move and NTS Incident to Vacating Local Economy Quarters.  (See paragraph 5.2.5.2.) 3.4.  (5320)  Separation From the Service or Relief from Active Duty Except for Discharge with Severance or Separation Pay. 3.4.1.  (5320-A)  General.    Use  Attachment  13  to  counsel  and  document  eligible  HHG transportation  allowances  for  member’s  leaving  the  Air  Force  under  the  provisions  of  JTR par.  5272.  Members should be carefully counseled BEFORE electing to receive travel pay to  a selected separation  point.  Election to  receive the greater amount of  travel  pay may be negligible when compared to the loss or restriction of the HHG shipment allowances. 3.4.1.1.  For separated members, there is no authority to consign shipments of HHG to an   embassy or consulate. 3.4.1.2.  Full  JTR  weight  allowance  IAW  par.  5200  is  authorized  upon  return  from OCONUS for separating members.  They are not restricted to allowance authorized to the OCONUS PDS.  However, to avoid excess costs, NTS and HHG at designated locations should be taken into account. 3.4.1.3.  When members die before exercising their entitlements, the dependents or other persons legally entitled are offered the same entitlements as the member. 3.4.1.4.    Member’s  separated  under  JTR,  par.  5066-A5  that  serve  less  than  the  prescribed period of service (90%) are authorized a HHG shipment.  The restrictions contained in par. 5066-A5 pertain to travel only. 3.4.2.  (5320-B1)  Non-Temporary  Storage.    Ninety  (90)  days  prior  to  expiration  of  NTS entitlement (180 days from effective date of separation), the (J)PPSO advises the member by any  communication  available  (e.g.  email  return  receipt,  mail,  phone,  DFAS,  etc.)  that  if application  for  shipment  is  not  received  by  the  (J)PPSO  before  the  expiration  of  the entitlement, the member’s NTS lot will convert to member’s expense.  Not later than 45 days before  the  NTS  entitlement  is  due  to  expire;  the  (J)PPSO  will  send  a  certified  letter  to  the member, and follow procedures outlined in the DTR, Chapter 406, para C.13. 3.4.2.1.  If the member elects to have their property continue in storage at the end of the 180-day authorized period, they must be briefed that the storage will convert to member’s expense  at  a  cost  negotiated  between  the  member  and  the  NTS  Transportation  Service Provider (TSP).  The Transportation Officer should assist the member in negotiating with the  contractor  continuance  of  the  lot  at  the  Government  rate.  Members  are  also responsible for acquiring loss/damage insurance for storage of their property beyond the   24  AFI24-501  10 OCTOBER 2014 basic  180-day  time  limit  and  contacting  the  TSP  to  make  arrangements  for  storage payments.    Members  must  apply  for  an  extension  for  travel  and  transportation entitlement, which if approved, will only allow for release and shipment of the personal property  to  the  applicable  HOR/PLEAD.    Shipment  to  any  other  place  as  specified  in JTR,  para  5066-A,  is  limited  to  the  cost  of  transporting  the  member’s  maximum  HHG weight allowance to the applicable HOR/PLEAD. 3.4.2.2.  (5320-B2)  Temporary  Storage.    Temporary  Storage  of  HHG  transported  from NTS should be avoided.  Close coordination between TSP and the member is critical.  If temporary storage becomes necessary the destination (J)PPSO is the appropriate authority to authorize/approve. See par. 5.1.9. 3.4.3.  (5320-F)  Member  Required  to  Vacate  Government  or  Government  Controlled Quarters Upon Separation or Relief from Active Duty.  This local drayage authority applies only to  a member  who is  in  physical  receipt of a separation order.  A member’s separation order is to be used to effect the shipment under this paragraph.  The following statement is to be annotated in the remarks section of the DD Form 1299, “Shipment per JTR, par. 5320-F.”  Shipment is authorized to any point within the local area.  (See paragraph 9.5.) 3.4.4.  (5320-G)  Time Limit. 3.4.4.1.  Submission  of  an  application  is  not  to  be  interpreted  strictly  as  the  member's signature on the DD Form 1299.  A constructive application, which contains the signature of  the  member,  such  as  a  letter,  fax  or  message  from  the  member,  within  the  specified time frame, is acceptable. 3.4.4.2.  Extension of the time limit is permitted if a written request is submitted within the  180-day-time  limit;  and  physical  release  of  HHG  within  the  180-day-time  limit would impose a hardship on the separated member (if in the Government’s interest). 3.4.4.3.  (J)  PPSOs  may  approve  extension  for  shipment  for  a  period  of  15  workdays following  the  scheduled  pickup  date.    This  applies  when  hardship  occurs  after  shipping arrangements  have  been  made,  but  before  the  scheduled  date  services  are  to  be performed.  Extension requests and authorizations or approvals are to be documented and retained in the shipment file. 3.4.4.4.  PPA HQ is delegated authority to approve or disapprove requests for extensions beyond  15  workdays.    Requests  must  be  based  on  a  bona  fide  hardship  to  the  member that would be created by compliance with the 180-day basic entitlement.  All requests for extensions  will be fully  documented and  forwarded to  PPA HQ/ECAF-B, 2261 Hughes Ave,  Ste  159,  Lackland  AFB,  TX    78236-9857,  email:  hqppa.ecaf-ext@us.af.mil,  fax (210)  321-4263.    (J)PPSO  should  access  PPA  HQ  electronic  system  to  check  for approval/disapproval letters. 3.4.4.4.1.  The  following  are  examples  of  situations  under  which  extensions  will  be considered: Reason For Extension & Documents Required  (See Note) Delay in selling/renovating/construction of home.  Statement from contractor showing the reasons for delay and approximate date of completion.  # of Extension   2 AFI24-501  10 OCTOBER 2014   25  Member’s Education.

Note:  The  circumstances  outlined  above  are  guidelines  only.    Due consideration must be given to circumstances surrounding each member’s request.  Each  extension  equals  180  days  (e.g.,  2  extensions  =  360  days)  not  to  exceed  5 extensions. 3.4.4.4.3.  Extension requests forwarded to PPA HQ must contain a specific date for the  new  time  limitation.    Requests  for  open-ended  extensions  (i.e.,  until  my  spouse separates, retires, transfers, etc.) are to be returned without action. 3.5.

Place  the  original  in  the member's  case  file  and  give  the  duplicate  copy  to  the  member.    AF  Form  2473  may  be obtained through AF publishing, reproduced locally, or produced from automated systems. 3.5.1.1.  Home of selection is the place selected by the member under JTR, par. 5068.   26  AFI24-501  10 OCTOBER 2014 3.5.1.1.1.  A home of selection shipment at Government expense is authorized to any place within the United States (including Alaska and Hawaii). 3.5.1.1.2.  A shipment  is authorized to  a place outside the United States from  which the member was called (or ordered) to active duty to the first duty station. 3.5.1.1.3.  Any  “other  place”  at  a  cost  not  to  exceed  what  it  would  have  cost  the Government had the member selected a home at a specified place in the CONUS. Note:  If “other place” is selected, collection action is effected by PPA HQ based on all pertinent travel and transportation documents.  Counselors should advise the member to select a CONUS location that yields the greater allowance. 3.5.1.1.4.  If member chooses an HOS outside the United States as “other place”, NO POV transportation entitlement exists. 3.5.1.2.  For  a  retired  member,  the  HHG  weight  allowance  is  noted  in  JTR,  par.  5200.  The pay grade in which the member was serving on the LAST day of active duty is used. 3.5.1.3.  For a member separated or retired under JTR, par. 5318, there is no authority to consign a shipment of HHG to an embassy or consulate. 3.5.1.4.  For members separating or retiring under JTR, par. 5318, full weight allowance is authorized upon return from OCONUS. 3.5.2.  (5318-C4)  Temporary Storage. 3.5.2.1.  If  temporary  storage  meets  the  requirements  of  JTR,  pars.  5318-C4a  or  b,  the destination PPSO is the appropriate authority to authorize/approve SIT. 3.5.3.

Not later than 45 days  before  the  NTS  entitlement  is  due  to  expire;  the  (J)PPSO  will  send  a  certified letter to the member, and follow procedures outlined in the DTR, Chapter 406, para C.13. 3.5.5.3.2.  If members elect to have their property continue in storage at the end of the 1-year  authorized  period,  they  must  be  briefed  that  the  storage  will  convert  to  their expense  at  a  cost  negotiated  between  the  member  and  the  NTS  TSP.    The Transportation  Officer  should  assist  the  member  in  negotiating  with  the  contractor continuance of the lot at the Government rate.

Note:  The circumstances outlined above are guidelines only.  Due consideration is to be given to circumstances surrounding each member’s request.  Comptroller General Decision B-207157, 2 Feb 1983 states “The primary requirement is that the travel be the result  of  separation/retirement  from  the  service,  since  it  is  not  a  benefit  which  the separated/retired member retains until used regardless of circumstances.”  Each extension equals 1 year but may not be extended for more than a total of 6 years (including the first year after retirement) from the retirement/separation date IAW JTR, par. 5000-B6.   30  AFI24-501  10 OCTOBER 2014 3.5.6.3.

(5236-A)  General.    Departing  personnel  should  be  thoroughly  briefed  on  their responsibility to promptly notify the Transportation Service Provider (TSP) when they arrive at destination. 5.1.1.1.  When  temporary  storage  is  required  at  origin,  two  methods  of  storage  may  be used.    If  the  member  specified  a  geographical  destination,  a  GBL  or  similar  type  of shipping  document  authorizing  SIT  at  origin  may  be  issued  to  cover  storage  and movement.  If the member does not designate a destination state, HHG may be placed in storage under a Tender of Service or DPM contract. 5.1.1.2.  Personal property remaining in origin SIT beyond storage authorization will be at member’s/employee’s expense.  TSP will bill for origin services and GBL Correction Notice  will  be  issued  for  “origin  services  only”  no  line-haul  or  destination  service performed.    DPM  contractors  will  invoice  for  origin  services.    Member/employee  must coordinate storage payment directly with TSP. 5.1.1.3.  If  shipment  is  made  at  a  later  date  and  the  member  has  not  yet  reimbursed  the Government,  collection  action  is  to  be  canceled.    The  initial  warehouse  handling  and storage  are  ‘services  authorized  incident  to  the  line-haul  shipment’.    If  payment  has already been made, the member may file a claim for reimbursement. 5.1.1.4.  If  a  member  remains  in  a  pay  status  and  receives  further  PCS  orders  before requesting  shipment  under  the  previous  order,  collection  for  origin  services  and  storage previously  furnished  remains  valid.    However,  these  charges  should  not  be  collected  if the new order amends, modifies, or revokes the previous order (JTR par. 5256) or if the member requests a shipment under the chain-of-orders concept. 5.1.1.5.  Members  separated  in  a  NON-PAY  status  could  also  face  situations  wherein approved temporary storage  expires before the shipping entitlements  expire (i.e.:  HHG placed in storage at origin before the separation date or member obtained an extension of the shipping time limitation.).  In those circumstances, follow the guidance above. 5.1.2.  (5240)  First  90  Days  of  Storage.    Advise  the  member  that  temporary  storage  is  an entitlement contingent upon necessity.  Do not arbitrarily advise the member of an automatic entitlement to temporary storage.  (J)PPSOs are to maintain an effective suspense system on all temporary storage.  Members are to be notified as to expiration of temporary storage and advised  as  to  their  responsibilities  concerning  removal  or  continued  storage.    Members should  be  thoroughly  counseled  so  they  understand  and  can  comply  with  all  instructions relating to temporary storage entitlements. 5.1.3.  (5242)  Second  90  Days  of  Storage.    Use  DD  Form  1857,  Temporary  Commercial Storage  at  Government  Expense  to  document  additional  SIT.    Ensure  member  provides justification  to  warrant  an  extension  for  conditions  beyond  their  control.    When  applicable, PPPOs will assist members and send DD Form 1857 and justification to (J)PPSO responsible for shipment.   34  AFI24-501  10 OCTOBER 2014 5.1.4.  (5244)  Storage After First 180 Days.  See 5244-A and B.  Approval/denial authority for  shipments  in  temporary  storage  beyond  180  days  is  delegated  to  the  appointed Transportation Officer (TO) at the (J)PPSO.  There is no appeal process above the appointed TO/JPPSO to reconsider SIT approval or denial. 5.1.4.1.  (5244-A)  Additional  Storage  When  Member  on  TDY  or  Deployed  for  More Than  90  days  or  for  an  Indefinite  Period  While  HHG  are  in  Temporary  Storage.    The Transportation Officer (TO) at the (J)PPSO is designated to authorize/approve additional storage under JTR, par. 5244-A.  Criteria to consider when approving SIT: 5.1.4.1.1.  Household  Goods  that  arrive  at  the  PDS  after  a  member  begins  a deployment should be placed in SIT. 5.1.4.1.2.  Upon arrival at the PDS where a future deployment is known, the member has an inherent responsibility to secure adequate housing to accept their HHG prior to deployment and SIT should  be terminated.   In circumstances where reasonable time to locate housing is not available, SIT may be provided. 5.1.4.1.3.  Do not approve continued SIT for member’s that re-locate dependents and concurrent  BAH  is  received.    If  member  elects  not  to  establish  a  household  at  new PDS,  and continues to  receive  BAH, storage under the PCS order is  not  authorized.  Member may request storage using unit funds under para 1.6.2., however, deployment storage is normally not approved when BAH is received. 5.1.4.1.4.  Requests must include a copy of the member's TDY or deployment order, together  with  the  member’s  statement  as  to  the  necessity  for  additional  temporary storage.  Storage  at  Government  expense  terminates  not  later  than  90  days  after completion of TDY or deployment unless the approving official authorizes additional storage (not to exceed an additional 90 days). 5.1.4.2.  (5244-B)  Additional  Storage  Under  Circumstances  Beyond  Member's  Control.  Approval criteria for shipments in temporary storage over 180 days are as follows: 5.1.4.2.1.  Storage  required  to  permit  direct  delivery  from  temporary  storage  into Government  quarters.  To meet  this criterion  authorizing an extension for a specific delivery date, the member must be on the active Government quarters waiting list. 5.1.4.2.1.1.  Note:  This does not apply to members who are on a waiting list for a specific type of house when other adequate housing is available.  Verification in writing  from  the  housing  office  is  required.    If  a  member  is  removed  from  the active waiting list, Government SIT terminates immediately, or 5.1.4.2.2.  Storage required due to non-availability of suitable local economy quarters for the member based on the member's pay grade and family size must be supported by documentation from the local housing office, or 5.1.4.2.3.  Other deserving cases wherein members submit justification indicating that the situation is beyond their control and that failure to provide the additional storage would create a financial hardship. 5.1.5.  Conversion to Member’s Expense.  Temporary storage is terminated at 2400 hours on the  final  day  of  approved  storage  with  the  account  converting  to  the  member's  expense.  TSPs  must  receive  the  DD  Form  1857  prior  to  the  expiration  date  for  the  extension  to  be AFI24-501  10 OCTOBER 2014   35  accepted.  Additional  accrued  storage  charges  become  a  matter  for  resolution  between  the member and the storage company. 5.1.5.1.  After  conversion  to  member’s  expense,  the  member  is  entitled  to  delivery  at Government  expense.    The  (J)PPSO  using  the  GBL,  local  invoicing  or  purchasing procedures if the GBL, has been terminated shall make payment for delivery services at Government expense. 5.1.5.2.  Note:  Conversion to member’s expense is the (J)PPSO responsibility. 5.1.6.  (5252-B1)  Temporary  Storage  Converted  to  NTS.    The  (J)PPSO  is  the  designated approval authority for converting SIT at origin to NTS.  (Including PPMs) 5.1.7.  (5246-A)  HHG  Partial  Lot  Withdrawal  and  Delivery  from  Temporary  Storage.    The Transportation Officer  is the designated approval authority for a partial lot withdrawals and deliveries from SIT and in determining if circumstances warranted Government payment for a  second  delivery.    Partial  lot  withdrawals  and  deliveries  from  SIT  beyond  two  are  the member’s financial responsibility. 5.1.8.  (5248)  Short Distance Moves. 5.1.8.1.  (5248-B)  Inter-City  Moves.    Approval/authorization  for  storage  under  this paragraph is the same as identified in JTR, par. 5260-C.  Approval authority for retirees and separatees in this paragraph is the (J)PPSO. 5.1.9.  (5250)  SIT for HHG Transported From NTS. 5.1.9.1.  Prudent  traffic  management  requires  members  to  provide  a  delivery  address prior to shipment from NTS to permit direct delivery, prevent unnecessary SIT, and limit re-handling of property.  If circumstances lead to HHG being shipped with no destination address,  transportation  officers  may  authorize  SIT  contingent  upon  necessity  IAW  par. 5250. 5.2.  (5212)  NON-TEMPORARY STORAGE. 5.2.1.  (5214-A)  General.    When  NTS  is  authorized  from  OCONUS,  HHG  are  normally returned  to  a  CONUS  port  of  entry  for  NTS.    NTS  is  authorized  OCONUS  when  such approved facilities are available for: 5.2.1.1.  Members OCONUS who select a home in or near the OCONUS duty station and have a home of selection shipping allowance. 5.2.2.  (5214-B)  Return  of  HHG  from  OCONUS.    HHG  returned  from  OCONUS  for  NTS are to be forwarded to the CONUS NTS storage facilities.  Shipments are to be marked and documented "FOR NON-TEMPORARY STORAGE", and supported by a DD Form 1299 and the member's order. 5.2.3.  (5216-C)  NTS as an Alternative to Transportation.  The Transportation Officer is the designated approval authority:  (See Attachment 11). 5.2.3.1.  When  cost  comparison  indicates  NTS  for  the  contemplated  period  of  the  new assignment  will  cost  less  than  or  equal  to  shipment  of  the  property  to  the  new  duty station.   36  AFI24-501  10 OCTOBER 2014 5.2.3.2.  When  HHG  are  in  NTS  and  continued  storage  costs  less  than  or  equal  to shipment to the new assignment. 5.2.3.3.   Note:  PPA HQ is the determining authority in all other cases. 5.2.4.  (5234)  NTS  Converted  to  Temporary  Storage.    This  entitlement  applies  only  to  the removal  of  HHG  from  NTS  for  line-haul  shipment  under  the  same  order  for  which  HHG were placed in NTS.  The Transportation Officer is the designated approval authority.  A DD Form  139,  Pay  Adjustment  Authorization,  is  to  be  initiated  to  collect  storage  charges  in excess  of  180  days  unless  additional  storage  is  authorized  under  JTR,  par.  5244.    Ensure copies are available in the applicable records imaging system. 5.2.5.  (5222)  NTS  Incident  to  Occupancy  of  Government/Government-Controlled  QTRS OR Privatized Housing and  Incident to  Vacating  Local  Private Sector Housing.  Applies to CONUS  and  OCONUS  areas.    An  order  (AF  Form  150,  Drayage/Storage  Authorization  - Government Quarters) authorizing drayage and storage at Government expense must contain a fund citation provided by the housing or billeting officer. 5.2.5.1.  (5222-A)  Incident  to  Occupancy  of  Government  or  Government-Controlled Quarters or Privatized Housing. 5.2.5.1.1.  Under  certain  circumstances,  when  it  has  been  predetermined  that  a member  is  to  occupy  Government  quarters  immediately  upon  arrival  at  a  new  duty station,  the  member  may  apply  for  NTS  at  the  old  duty  station  in  CONUS.    The gaining installation will fund the storage cost for the NTS regardless of the location of the  property.    This  exception  ordinarily  applies  to  key  and  essential  personnel required to  occupy  pre-designated quarters or members who  arrived at  the PDS  and received new quarters prior to moving HHG from their old PDSs.  The items must be declared excess to the requirements in assigned quarters at the new duty station.  As such, the members would be afforded the opportunity to inspect assigned Government quarters and could, at that time, determine NTS requirements at origin.  The housing office  at  destination  would  have  to  issue  an  appropriate  order  (AF  Form  150)  and funding for the items authorized for NTS at origin. 5.2.5.1.2.  Members  assigned  to  or  between  Government  quarters  who  intend  to declare articles excess to space limitations must submit a list of articles to the housing or billeting office that controls the assignment to Government quarters. 5.2.5.1.2.1.  The  member  must  prepare  a  list  of  articles  to  be  placed  into  NTS.  The  responsible  housing  manager  reviews  and  authenticates  this  listing.  Normally,  this  is  done  before  the  actual  movement  of  the  HHG  to,  from,  or between  Government  quarters.    The  PPSO  does  not  arrange,  or  store  at Government  expense, any  articles not  identified on the  inventory and authorized by the housing manager. 5.2.5.1.3.  Property placed into NTS incident to the assignment to, from,  or between Government  quarters  is  not  to  be  removed  at  Government  expense  without  the express consent of the housing or billeting manager and specific authorization of the ordering officer. AFI24-501  10 OCTOBER 2014   37  5.2.5.1.4.  Members  vacating  Government  quarters  at  personal  expenses  are  entitled to  storage  (through  date  of  quarters  termination),  and  handling-out  to  warehouse platform, local drayage, and unpacking at Government expense. 5.2.5.2.  (5222-E)  Incident to Vacating Local Economy Quarters.  A written order citing specific authority for the local drayage and local O&M funds (Fund citations) is required to support application for such moves. 5.2.6.  (5224)  NTS  When  Ordered  on  PCS  to  a  Remote  CONUS  Area  with  a  Housing Shortage.  AF/A4LR is designated to authorize/approve this NTS.  The member's application is to be submitted through command channels.  The authorizing/order issuing authority must indicate the restricted nature of the assignment. 5.2.7.  (5232)  Time Limits. 5.2.7.1.  Situation  Number  18  -  Termination  of  Entitlement.    When  a  member  is missing/absent  for  a  period  of  more  than  29  days,  PPA  HQ/ECAF  is  designated  to authorize extensions under this provision. 5.2.7.2.  Situation Number 26 - Termination of Entitlement.  Property awarded to an ex-spouse incident due to divorce may remain in storage for a reasonable period.  The time cannot exceed the member's authorized storage period based on the member's assignment at the time of the divorce.  If the member is still in a pay status the (J)PPSO may elect to maintain the Government-funded character of the shipment in NTS and recoup the excess storage cost from the member upon delivery.   38  AFI24-501  10 OCTOBER 2014 Chapter 6 PRIVATELY OWNED VEHICLE (POV) TRANSPORTATION PART A:  TRANSPORTATION OF POVS 6.1.  (5332)  Eligibility. 6.1.1.  The  "ownership  prior  to  effective  date  of  orders  provision"  does  not  apply  for shipment of POVs. 6.1.2.

Normally,  replacement  transportation  is  not approved if the member is in possession of a second vehicle, or if a vehicle can be purchased in the oversea location through private sales or manufacturer new car sales programs. Time remaining on station requirements in paragraphs 6.2.1 and 6.2.1.1 does not apply.  However, approval for members with less than one year remaining must have strong justification.  This section pertains to shipment of POVs from CONUS to the OCONUS station. 6.2.3.1.  Requests for authorization to  replace a POV originally shipped overseas that is "worn out due to  age and normal deterioration, or was lost through fire, theft or similar cases," must meet the criteria below. 6.2.3.1.1.    The  vehicle  shall  be  disposed  of  and  supporting  documentation  (letter  from salvage yard, repair company, etc.) is used to support the request.  Sale to a private party does not meet the par. 5360-B2 requirement. 6.2.3.1.2.  Consider the age of the vehicle when initially shipped OCONUS. The age and condition of the vehicle should be expected to last the duration of the OCONUS tour. 6.2.3.1.3.  Whether  the  member  is  currently  in  possession  of  another  vehicle,  and  if so, why that vehicle is not considered a suitable replacement. 6.2.3.1.4.  Whether an adequate replacement vehicle can be purchased at the oversea duty station. 6.3.  (5352)  POV Transportation To/From Ports. 6.3.1.

By  Memorandum  of  6  Sep  95,  the  Assistant  Secretary  of  Defense  (Force Management Policy) has granted the Commander US Forces Japan a limited waiver authority to this embargo.  Waiver application procedures are contained in the PPCIG for Japan.   40  AFI24-501  10 OCTOBER 2014 6.6.2.1.  The waiver authority does not include Okinawa because it does not have the air pollution laboratory required for emission testing. 6.6.2.2.  Member  is  responsible  for  all  charges  associated  with  meeting  Government  of Japan vehicle emission standards. 6.6.2.3.  If  a  vehicle  is  unable  to  meet  Government  of  Japan  standards,  the  member  is financially  responsible  for  disposal  of  the  vehicle  and  any  associated  costs  of  such disposal.

Reimbursement  for  personally  procured  transportation  of  POVs  must  meet  the requirements  of  JTR,  par.  5340-B.    If  POV  is  transported  on  foreign  registered  TSP, statement of non-availability of U.S. flag TSP is required. 6.6.4.  (5336)  POV Size Limit.  Size restrictions for POV shipment is 20 MT.  The formula for determining the measurement ton (MT) size of a POV is: length times width times height (in feet) divided by 40.  (EXAMPLE:  (L) 17' x (W) 8' x (H) 5.75' = 782 cubic feet,  40 = 19.55 MTs).  Size restriction does not apply for members who are authorized shipment of an oversized  POV  for  medical  reasons.    Members  must  send  requests  through  the  Installation Surgeon  General  and  MPS.    Authorization  for  oversized  vehicle  under  these  circumstances must be annotated on member’s order. 6.7.  (5350)  Ports/VPCs Used. 6.7.1.  (5350-B)  Designation of Ports. 6.7.1.1.  The  designated  port  for  entitlement  purposes  is  the  SDDC  controlled  VPC nearest to the current and next PDS or a VPC in between the old and new PDS. 6.7.1.2.  See  Global  POV  Contract  for  identification  of  ports  that  have  service  between the shipping and receiving points. 6.7.2.  (5350-C)  Alternate Ports/VPCs. 6.7.2.1.  For  entitlement  purposes,  shipments  from  a  port  located  in  a  different  country than  the  designated  port’s  country,  requires  PPA  HQ  approval  (EXCEPTION: SAF/MRM has granted approval for AF members in Europe to ship from any European port provided members pay any excess costs). 6.7.2.1.1.  A request is to be forwarded to the applicable MAJCOM, or the PPA HQ in the absence of a MAJCOM/A4R, for initial determination.  If the request contains adequate justification, it is to be forwarded to PPA HQ for approval. 6.7.2.1.2.  Any  request  forwarded  must  contain  a  strong  MAJCOM-recommended positive endorsement.  Prime considerations in forwarding a case for review are those situations beyond the member's control and those where approval would alleviate an undue hardship. 6.7.2.2.  Other than Designated Shipping Port  Usage Within  the CONUS.   The member must be advised of the responsibility for any excess cost for use of a port/VPC other than a designated port/VPC. AFI24-501  10 OCTOBER 2014   41  6.7.3.

Once in storage, POVs may be removed from storage in lieu of continued storage for the duration of the TDY.  POVs removed in lieu of continued storage, may be returned to the VPC for return shipment to the VPC servicing the OCONUS PDS. 6.12.1.4.  PPA  HQ  is  delegated  authority  to  approve  or  disapprove  requests  for  POV storage where laws, regulations, and/or other restrictions imposed by the foreign country, area, or, if the POV would require extensive modification as a condition of entry to the OCONUS area.  All requests for storage will be fully documented and forwarded to PPA HQ/ECAF-B,  2261  Hughes  Ave,  Ste  159,  Lackland  AFB,  TX    78236-9857,  email: hqppa.ecaf-ext@us.af.mil,  fax    (210)  321-4263.  Consider  the  following  criteria  when determining storage approval. 6.12.1.4.1.  POV  shipment  and  storage  is  a  discretionary  allowance  contingent  upon Service  HQ  approval.    The  Air  Force  permits  a  POV  shipment  to  most  locations except  where  prohibited  or  restricted  in  the  PPCIG  (Japan/Okinawa  vehicles manufactured  after  1976,  Korea  for  E-6  and  below,  or those  serving  an unaccompanied tour, etc.). 6.12.1.4.2.  The  intent  of  POV  shipment  and  storage  is  to  provide  for  the  member's primary means of transportation at the permanent duty station.  It is not an automatic entitlement to be used to transport or store vintage, historic, classic, restored, collector or customized vehicles. 6.12.1.4.3.

(5384)  Storage Facilities Used.  (See para 6.12.1.2). 6.13.1.  Air Force members who have  an eligible allowance to  store  a POV as a result of a PCS are required to use one of the following options: DoD Global POV Contract (GPC) or personally procured commercial storage. If the member self-procures storage, reimbursement is limited to the Government constructive cost cited in the GPC. 6.13.2.  Note:  Commercial  facilities  are  defined  as  those  businesses  that  offer  vehicle storage to the general public.  Storage in a private residence garage or a private lot does not constitute storage at a commercial facility. 6.13.3.  SDDC  website  (http://www.sddc.army.mil)  contains  information  on  GPC  storage requirements. 6.14.  (5384-C)  Other  Excess    Storage  Costs.  Member’s  that  store  a  POV  at  Government expense that exceeds 20 Measurement Tons are responsible for excess storage costs.  Exception: The approving medical facility may grant an exception to policy for vehicles that require special medical  modifications.  Authorization for oversized vehicles under these circumstances must be annotated on member’s orders.   44  AFI24-501  10 OCTOBER 2014 6.14.1.

Consumables may consist of food stuff items, household or other personal items  that  are  to  be  consumed  and  need  replacement.    Consumables  cannot  include  any prohibited  items  (i.e.,  hazardous).    The  member  should  have  received  information  from  the sponsor advising which types of consumables are not available at the new location. 9.4.  Government  (TRANSPORTATION)  Constructed  Cost  (GCC).  The  ‘Best  Value’  cost the Government would have paid for Government-procured HHG transportation. 9.5.  Motorcycle/Moped: 9.5.1.  Shipment in HHG does not change federal emission control or safety requirements in effect for that model year.  Motorcycles/mopeds entering the CONUS, not conforming to US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)/Department of Transportation (DOT) standards, are not  to  be  included  in  HHG  because  the  entire  shipment  would  be  delayed  and  opened  at CONUS  port  of  entry  by  customs.    The  certification  label  affixed  to  the  frame  is  used  to determine  compliance  with  US  EPA/DOT  standards.    See  Shipping  Your  POV  Pamphlet (Nonconforming POVs) in Appendix K3 of the DTR Part IV. Note:  Members may elect to make a separate HHG shipment, subject to excess cost, for nonconforming motorcycles/mopeds.  9.5.2.

Some foreign countries require a motorcycle/moped to be licensed as a POV.  These countries may also allow importation of only one POV.  The owner should be advised of the country's  importation  licensing/registration  requirements  if  also  anticipating  shipment  of  a POV.    Owners  shipping  a  POV  to  such  countries  should  consider  whether  shipment  of  a motorcycle/moped  in  HHG  is  wise.    The  owner  may  incur  excessive  customs  duties  plus other associated costs.  Consult the PPCIG, for host country requirements/restrictions.  When in  doubt, the  responsible transportation authority at destination. the  origin  PPSO/PPPO  must  request  clarification  from 9.5.4.  For  surface  shipments,  documents  must  identify  the  location  of  the  vehicle  in  the shipment.  This is necessary because any surface shipment destined to/from OCONUS may be diverted to an air shipment.  If the shipment is diverted to AMC, a Shipper Certification for  Dangerous  Goods  must  be  prepared.    To  complete  the  form,  service  liaison  and  AMC personnel must be able to locate the vehicle in the shipment. AFI24-501  10 OCTOBER 2014   49  9.6.  Permanent  (Duty)  Station  (PDS).

AMC TP-4 airlift of HHG can be used with Code T or DPM shipment modes.  However, AMC air terminal managers control the availability of this service over specific airlift  channels  in  coordination  with  the  Air  Clearance  Authorities  (ACA).    They determine  the  actual  amount  of  TP-4  accepted  into  the  aerial  ports.    They  also  work together to  fill  excess  capacity  to  maximize aircraft utilization.  The  ACA validates the movement and coordinates with the appropriate APOE.  Shippers should use one of the following methods when requesting clearance of HHG at the TP-4 rate. 10.6.2.3.1.  Via https://Isotools.wpafb.af.mil/atcmd/ AFI24-501  10 OCTOBER 2014   53  10.6.2.3.2.  Fax information to DSN (312) 787-3185 or commercial (937) 257-3185 10.6.2.3.3.  Telephone  ACA  office  DSN  (312)787-4949  or  commercial  (937)  257-4946. 10.6.2.4.  Available TP-4 airlift may be used when a cost comparison indicates that it is cost favorable or when it is required to meet the member's, dependent's, or next-of-kin's requirements.    However,  HHG  shipments  are  to  move  as  TP-4  when  it  best  meets  the needs of the member without incurring storage-in-transit costs at destination. 10.6.2.5.  Shipments  returning  from  OCONUS  points  destined  for  CONUS  Non-temporary storage cannot be routed via TP-4. 10.6.2.6.  Once the appropriate ACA clears a shipment, it moves as TP-4.  Shipments are not  to  be  pulled  out  of  the  airlift  system  by  AMC  and  diverted  to  surface  movement without coordination with the ACA. 10.6.3.  TP-2 Airlift Requests.  Airlift requests (AMC TP-2) to, from or between other than approved  Hardlift  areas  are  sent  to  PPA  HQ/ECAF-B  at  hqppa.ecaf-ext@us.af.mil.

Specific  hardships  experienced  by  the  member  or  family.    Indicate whether  a  housing  loaner  kit  is  available  and  being  used  by  member.    General statements such as "member is in dire need," "member has quarters," and "past RDD" are insufficient to justify airlift. 10.6.3.5.3.  Any other data to assist in evaluation of requests. 10.6.3.6.  Airlift  requests  should  be  transmitted  to  PPA  HQ  with  information  copies  to AFMC LSO/LOTA and the MAJCOM (if applicable). 10.6.3.7.  Disapproval  authority  for  airlift  requests  is  HAF/A4LR.    If  PPA  HQ  believes the request  for airlift  lacks adequate justification, telephonic coordination is  to  be made with HAF/A4LR. 10.6.3.8.  Requests for airlift of a civilian employee’s HHG must include authority to cite the  specific  allotment.    If  authority  of  the  agency  controlling  the  funds  has  not  been obtained,  the  agency  is  to  be  included  as  an  action  addressee.    The  agency  is  to  be   54  AFI24-501  10 OCTOBER 2014 requested  to  furnish  PPA  HQ  authority  to  cite  their  funds  to  defray  airlift  cost.    The controlling agencies are: 10.6.3.8.1.

If  a movement  is  canceled, the Government  must pay  the TSP or  agent  for services  rendered up to the  movement  cancellation.    Use  the  following  procedures  to  effect  payment  for  services rendered: 10.9.1.  Do not cancel a GBL if it has been issued.  Obtain TSP or agent invoice, or DD Form 619,  from  the  TSP  or  agent  for  services  rendered.    The  Transportation  Officer  certifies services performed and accomplished on the GBL AT ORIGIN.  Annotate the GBL that NO LINE HAUL was involved and give a brief explanation as to why movement was canceled.  The documents are forwarded to the TSP or agent for use in submitting payment for services rendered. 10.9.2.  If a GBL was not issued, required, or canceled, the (J)PPSO obtains an invoice from the TSP or agent.  The invoice should show services rendered up to the time movement were canceled.    The  Transportation  Officer  certifies  on  the  invoice  that  services  were  performed and payment is due.  Annotate the invoice with the reason movement was canceled and why payment  is  being  made  in  this  manner.    Copies  of  the  applicable  movement  orders  and  the invoice  will  be  forwarded  to  Defense  Finance  and  Accounting  Services  (DFAS)  or  service finance center for payment. 10.9.3.  Use of these procedures for local moves is normally more expensive than using local packing and crating - contractor rates.  Therefore, local moves that use these procedures are subject to close review by audit, IG inspection, etc. 10.10.  Routing and Mode Selection of Domestic Shipments Weighing 1,000 pounds or Less. 10.10.1.  Shipping  offices  use  the  Direct  Procurement  Method  to  move  domestic  shipments estimated to weigh 1,000 pounds or less when cost-effective and circumstances warrant.

Introduction to Personally Procured Moves (PPM).  The personally procured method of HHG transportation is available to active duty, retired or separated members, and the next of kin of a deceased member.  The personally procured method allows members to personally procure HHG  transportation  and/or  NTS  when  they  have  an  entitlement  to  ship  or  store  HHG  in connection with a PCS move, special storage, local move, etc.  A member can use any privately owned  vehicle,  direct  hire  and/or  rental  of  a  conveyance  (with  or  without  operator)  to  move HHG.    Under  no  circumstances  is  the  use  of  a  Government  owned  and/or  leased  vehicle authorized  for  use.    This  method  allows  members  to  personally  procure  transportation  and/or NTS of HHG for either: 12.1.1.  Reimbursement  of  actual  cost  incurred  when  Government  transportation  is  not available and directed by the Transportation Officer to personally procure transportation for weight moved up to the member’s maximum authorized weight allowance, 12.1.2.  Reimbursement  of  authorized  expenses  incurred  not  to  exceed  the  Government Constructed Cost (GCC) for weight moved up to the member’s maximum authorized weight allowance, or 12.1.3.  A  monetary  allowance  equal  to  95%  of  the  GCC  for  weight  moved  up  to  the members maximum authorized weight allowance. 12.1.4.  Note:  If the member’s authorized expense incurred exceeds the monetary allowance equal  to  95%  of  the  GCC,  the  counselor  recreates/reimburses  the  PPM  in  accordance  with 12.1.2, not to exceed 100% of the GCC. 12.2.  Personally  Procured  Move  Procedures.  The  PPPO/PPSO  provides  members information  on the methods and procedures for  performing  a personally  procured move.  They advise members that he/she may choose one or a combination of the methods below, either alone or in conjunction with a Government arranged move.  The (J)PPSO will prepare a Letter of Non-Availability or PPPO/PPSO will prepare a DD Form 2278, whichever is applicable. (Figure 12.1) Include AF Form 2473 for a PPM under a retirement order. 12.2.1.  (5210-D4)  Government Procured HHG Transportation and/or NTS Not Available. 12.2.1.1.  (5210-D4a)  A  member  who  is  directed  in  writing  by  (J)PPSO  to  personally procure  transportation,  and/or  NTS  of  HHG  because  (J)PPSO  is  unable  to  procure Government  contractual  services  (GBL,  DPM,  etc.)  is  authorized  reimbursement  of actual costs for shipment/storage up to the member’s maximum authorized HHG weight allowance. 12.2.1.2.  When Government transportation of HHG/NTS cannot be procured to honor a member’s primary or alternate property movement dates due to TSP capacity constraints (e.g. blackout dates, saturation, or otherwise unavailable to perform the move), (J)PPSO will  notify  PPA  HQ/MAJCOM  of  its  inability  to  accommodate  the  member’s  request.  PPA  HQ  will  track  all  requests  for  actual  cost  reimbursement  and  notify  AF/A4LR  to ensure systemic challenges are addressed.   62  AFI24-501  10 OCTOBER 2014 12.2.1.3.    (J)PPSO will notify the member and responsible PPPO immediately directing the member  to  personally  procure  transportation  and/or  NTS  of  HHG.    (J)PPSO  will  generate and  provide  a  Non-Availability  Letter  (Figure  12.1)  to  the  member  authorizing  personal procurement for Actual Cost Reimbursement and PPPO will generate a DD Form 2278 under JTR, par. 5210-D4. 12.2.1.4.  This  method  can  be  extremely  costly  and  only  be  applied  in  circumstances where no transportation services are available. 12.2.1.5.  Advance Authorization.  The member may be provided an advanced operating allowance equal to the constructed expenses for transportation (JTR, 5196-1) to ship the member’s HHG not to exceed the member’s JTR weight allowance.  The member must provide a copy of the carrier’s estimated expenses to the PPPO/PPSO. 12.2.1.6.  (5206-K)  Special  Routing  and  Services.    Any  special  routing  and  services requested  under  this  section  are  not  included  as  part  of  the  actual  cost  and  are  not reimbursable. 12.2.2.  (5210-D5)  Government-procured  Transportation  and/or  NTS  Available.    The  GCC includes all authorized charges that would have been used to procure Government contractual services  outlined  in  the  applicable  SDDC  tender,  DPM  contract  or  NTS  Tender  of  Service (TOS)  at  point  of  origin.    For  local  moves  the  PPSO/PPPO  uses  the  applicable  local  move contract rate.  The PPSO/PPPO issues a DD Form 2278. 12.2.2.1.  (5210-D5a)  Actual Cost Reimbursement. A member who desires to personally procure  transportation  or  NTS  of  HHG  is  authorized  reimbursement  of  authorized expenses incurred, not  to  exceed the GCC for actual weight  moved up to  the member’s maximum authorized weight allowance. Payment of accessorial charges may be approved when charges would have been authorized during a Government-arranged move and all applicable tariff approval rules have been met.  The cost of accessorial services does not apply  to  the  calculation  of  the  GCC.    Payment  of  an  accessorial  is  in  addition  to  the authorized reimbursable expenses under the provisions of JTR, par. 5210-D5a. 12.2.2.1.1.  Advance  Authorized.    The  member  may  be  provided  an  advanced operating allowance equal to 60% of the GCC based on an estimated weight provided by  the  member  not  to  exceed  the  member’s  weight  allowance.  When  the  member provides a copy of the carrier’s invoice or estimated expenses exceeding 95% of the GCC,  the  member  may  be  provided  an  advanced  operating  allowance  equal  to  the constructed expenses, not to exceed 100% of the GCC (JTR, par. 5196-2). 12.2.2.2.  (5210-D5b)  Payment  of  Monetary  Allowance.  A  member  who  desires  to personally procure transportation and/or NTS of HHG may choose to receive a monetary allowance  equal  to  95%  of  the  GCC  for  actual  weight  moved  up  to  the  member’s maximum  authorized  weight  allowance.    Payment  of  accessorial  services  is  not authorized. 12.2.2.2.1.  Advance  Authorized.  The  member  may  be  provided  an  advanced operating  allowance  equal  to  60%  of  the  monetary  allowance  (95%  of  the  GCC) based  on  an  estimated  weight  provided  by  the  member  not  to  exceed  the  member’s weight allowance. (JTR, 5196-3) AFI24-501  10 OCTOBER 2014   63  12.2.2.3.  (5210-D5c)  Use  of  Mail  or  Small  Package  Service.    The  JTR  limits reimbursement  to  authorized  expenses  incurred  not  to  exceed  the  GCC  for  the  actual weight of HHG transported but not to exceed the member’s weight allowance.  Payment of monetary allowance is not authorized.  The GCC is computed in accordance with JTR, par. 5210-D9. 12.2.2.4.  (5210-D5d)  Temporary  Storage. temporary  storage reimbursement to authorized expenses incurred not to exceed the GCC for actual weight stored but not to exceed the member’s JTR weight allowance.   The  JTR limits 12.2.2.4.1.  The  member  may  make  arrangements  for  temporary  storage,  not  to exceed 90 days. If additional storage is required, the member may request approval of an additional 90 days storage reimbursement from the PPPO/PPSO. If approved, the PPPO/PPSO must document the approval using DD Form 1857 in 90-day increments IAW  established SIT criteria outlined in the JTR,  Air  Force Supplement  to  the JTR and  the  DTR,  Part  IV.    The  PPPO/PPSO  may  assist  the  member  in  arranging  for temporary  storage  if  requested  by  the  member  by  putting  property  in  SIT  at Government  expense  and  paying  for  storage/delivery  using  invoicing  procedures (purchase agreement).  Storage facilities authorized for use in the temporary storage of HHG consist of commercial warehouses or self-storage facilities where the general public may store property.  Storage in a private residence or garage or on a private lot does not constitute storage at a commercial facility. 12.2.2.4.2.  Temporary  storage  reimbursement  is  limited  to  the  first  day  and  each additional  day  of  SIT.    A  member  may  be  reimbursed  for  warehouse  handling  and delivery out provided receipts shows services were performed. 12.2.2.4.3.  In  order  to  qualify  for  temporary  storage  reimbursement,  the  household goods  must  be  physically  removed  from  the  vehicle  and  placed  into  a  commercial warehouse if a commercial carrier was used to transport the property. Documentation containing  the  name  and  address  of  the  commercial  facility  must  be  submitted accompanied  by  an  invoice.  SIT  is  not  reimbursed  for  a  member  who  negotiates  a direct  delivery  with  a  commercial  company,  and  the  commercial  company  elects  to hold the household goods on a vehicle at a residence or other location. For personally procured moves using portable moving and storage containers, the household  goods do not need to be removed from the container.  However, temporary storage will only be  reimbursed  when  the  container  is  stored  at  the  company’s  storage  center/facility not  at  the  member’s  origin  or  destination  residence.    In  addition,  some  portable moving  and  storage  container  companies  advertise  an  initial  period  of  storage  at  no extra charge to the member.  In those instances, temporary storage at the company’s storage center during this “no extra charge” period will not be reimbursed. 12.2.2.4.4.  A member is authorized to extend rental vehicle contracts in lieu of SIT to facilitate direct delivery to residence. Reimbursement is on an actual cost basis and no monetary  allowance  payment  is  authorized.    Use  400NG,  Item  185B  (Destination) only,  to  reimburse  SIT  on  a  rental  vehicle.

Storage  facilities  authorized  for  use  in  the  long-term storage  of  HHG  consist  of  commercial  warehouses  or  self-storage  facilities  where  the  general   64  AFI24-501  10 OCTOBER 2014 public may store property.  Storage in a private residence or garage or on a private lot does not constitute storage at a commercial facility. 12.3.1.  The PPPO/PPSO must use the lowest applicable rates contained in the current NTS TOS  to  determine  the  GCC  (packing,  handling  in,  drayage  in,  storage,  handling  out,  and drayage out). 12.3.2.  Members  can  obtain  an  advanced  operating  allowance  under  12.2.2.1.1.  or 12.2.2.2.1. (packing, handling in, drayage in, and storage rates apply). 12.3.3.  Members  can  receive  reimbursement/monetary  allowance  for  the  initial  storage under 12.2.2.1. or 12.2.2.2. (packing, handling in, drayage in, and storage rates apply). 12.3.4.

Advise  the  member  that  prior  to  reimbursing  for  temporary  storage,  the circumstances  must  meet  the  intent  for  normal  approval  of  SIT  for  a  Government-arranged move. For example, the Government typically does not reimburse for temporary storage en-route except under extreme circumstances such as a member receiving notice of a reassignment. 12.4.10.  PPPO/PPSO advises the member of Insurance Coverage (see 12.7). 12.4.11.  PPPO/PPSO  advises  the  member  for  shipments  releasing  from  commercial contracted NTS facilities, a legible copy of the storage contractor’s inventory must be used by the member to check for loss or damage.  If damage exists or if an item is missing, a DD Form  1840,  Joint  Statement  of  Loss  or  Damage  at  Delivery,  is  prepared.    Both  parties (member and warehouseman) must sign and date the DD Form 1840, each retaining a legible copy for their respective files. If there is no indication of loss or damage at the pick-up point (i.e., no DD Form 1840 initiated), the member assumes all responsibility for loss or damage. 12.5.  Vehicles  and  Equipment.  There are no restrictions as to the type of POV or equipment used, however, use of privately owned airplanes is not authorized under this program. 12.5.1.

If driver and/or passengers are in the vehicle at the time of tare weighing, they must be in the vehicle at the time of gross weighing. 12.6.  Shipment Weight.  Weight tickets that do not contain all increments of data in accordance with  12.11.1,  but  appear  valid  and  reflect  the  actual  weight  moved,  must  be  processed  for  a monetary allowance when verified by the PPPO/PPSO. 12.6.1.  Transportation Officer  may authorize/approve the use of a constructed weight prior to the performance of the personally procured move when circumstances listed in JTR, par. 5210-D6b,  apply.    When  PPSO/PPPO  operations  are  contracted,  the  Functional  Director  or Quality  Assurance  Evaluator  (QAE)(Government  personnel)  having  oversight  of  the contracted operations must certify use of a constructed weight.  For example: 12.6.1.1.  Government move would be paid on the basis of a factor other than weight. 12.6.1.2.  Scales are not available. (i.e., to/from/between Government quarters) 12.6.1.3.

If  a  member  includes  PBP&E  (JTR,  Chapter  5,  Part  A,  Section  5,  Subsection  g),  a detailed  list  must  be  provided  to  the  PPPO/PPSO  at  the  time  of  counseling.  Previous estimates,  inventories  or  lists  are  not  acceptable.    This  list  must  be  authorized/approved  by the  Transportation  Officer  or  designated  representative  using  the  cubic  foot  method. PPPO/PPSO may use and print from the on-line weight estimator at the www.move.mil web site to calculate PBP&E weight. Attach a copy of the approved list to the DD Form 2278 and retain a copy in member’s case file. 12.6.4.1.  PBP&E  list  must  contain  property  as  defined  in  JTR,  Appendix  A  Part  1  for member and member’s spouse. 12.6.4.2.  PBP&E is computed at 7 pounds per cubic foot. 12.6.4.3.    The  list  or  weight  estimator  establishes  the  PBP&E  weight  to  be  added  to  the member’s  JTR  weight  allowance  only.  The  PPSO/PPPO  will  compute  the  estimated  GCC based on a member’s estimated weight to include PBP&E. 12.6.4.4.    Members are not required to obtain separate weight tickets for their PBP&E. 12.6.4.5.      If  a  member  exceeds  their  JTR  weight  allowance  and  has  approved  PBP&E weight,  reimbursement  and/or  monetary  allowance  is  based  on  their  JTR  weight  allowance plus the approved PBP&E weight. 12.7.  Insurance Coverage.  The PPPO/PPSO advises members of their rights to file claims with the  Government  for  loss  or  damage  under  the  Military  Personnel  and  Civilian  Employees’ Claims  Act  (Title  31  U.S.C.  sections  3701  and  3721).  Claims  are  generally  paid  for  those damages incurred due to circumstances beyond a member’s control (vehicle accidents, leakage, fires,  or  thefts  in  which  the  member  is  free  of  negligence).  Members  may  want  to  consider buying  private  insurance  to  cover  HHG  being  transported  if  they  believe  the  basic  valuation coverage  by  the  Government  ($40,000.00)  is  not  enough  to  cover  the  value  of  their  property. This added protection may be especially important if the member is moving items for which the Government  may  pay  limited  maximum  amounts  if  lost  or  damaged.  Cost  of  insurance  or, additional  insurance,  for  shipment  or  storage  is  not  reimbursable.  Members  should  contact  the Air Force Claims Service Center for information on maximum amounts. 12.7.1.  The PPPO/PPSO advises members who plan to use a trailer for a personally procured move to check their automobile insurance policy to determine if they are properly covered in   68  AFI24-501  10 OCTOBER 2014 case  of  loss  or  damage.  Some  automobile  insurance  companies  may  extend  coverage  when trailers  are  towed  behind  a  POV;  others  may  not.  The  member  must  procure  additional insurance if required. The Government does not reimburse insurance cost. 12.7.2.  The  PPPO/PPSO  advises  members  that  if  they  are  involved  in  accidents,  the  other parties may file claims against the members or their insurance companies. In such cases, the law of the state where the accident occurs determines liability. 12.7.2.1.  Some  courts  have  determined  that  members  operating  privately  owned  or rented  vehicles  on  change-of-station  moves  are  not  acting  within  the  scope  of  their employment. Thus, they may not  be protected by  the  Federal  Tort  Claims  Act,  Title 28 U.S.C.  §2679(b).  As  a  result,  members  may  be  held  personally  liable  if  they  have inadequate  insurance  coverage  to  satisfy  all  damage  and  third-party  injury  claims  or lawsuits resulting from an accident. 12.7.2.2.  If a member is involved in an accident, he or she should notify the staff judge advocate at the nearest military base about the accident as soon as possible. 12.8.  Personally  Procured  Moves  OCONUS.  A  member  may  personally  procure  HHG shipment services to and from OCONUS.  However, the PPPO/PPSO should advise the member that if choosing to personally procure transportation of HHG to an OCONUS area, that he/she is entirely  responsible  for  all  issues  related  to  the  Status  Of  Forces  Agreement  (SOFA), import/export  processes,  tariffs,  customs,  etc.  PPSO/PPPOs  SHOULD  DISCOURAGE  THIS UNLESS  THE  MEMBER INTERNATIONAL REQUIREMENTS. IS  THOROUGHLY  FAMILIAR  WITH 12.8.1.  PPM shipments to OCONUS locations will be closed out by destinations with DPS capability; otherwise, it will be completed by origin PPSO/PPPO. 12.9.  Unauthorized Items.  See JTR, Appendix A, Part 1 for definition of HHG. 12.9.1.  If  a  member  chooses  to  move  unauthorized/hazardous  items  with  their  personally procured shipment, they may do so as long as the weight of unauthorized/hazardous items are not included in the net weight of the authorized items contained within the shipment. 12.9.2.  A  member  who  includes  unauthorized/hazardous  items  in  the  weight  of  their personally procured move forfeits their monetary allowance or reimbursement and their case file will be turned over to appropriate authorities for review. 12.10.  Combined  Shipment  –  Military  Married  to  Military.  A  husband  and  wife  who  are both  military  members  may  ship  or  store  their  combined  JTR  authorized  weight  allowance.  A copy of each member’s order is required. 12.10.1.  PPPO/PPSO prepare one DD Form 2278 using the senior member’s profile and the senior  member’s  order.    Additionally  attach  a  copy  of  spouse’s  travel  order  and  have  both members sign the DD Form 2278. 12.10.2.  PPPO/PPSO  uses  the  Combined  PPM  (Mil-Mil)  Tool  to  prepare  the  Advanced Operating Allowance (AOA) and reimbursement or payment letter for each member. 12.10.2.1.    PPSO/PPPO authorizes each member an AOA based on the combined estimated weight.  Each member receives a proportionate amount based on their weight allowance. AFI24-501  10 OCTOBER 2014   69  12.10.2.2.  PPSO/PPPO authorizes each member reimbursement or payment based on the combined actual  weight  moved, but  not  to  exceed the combined JTR  authorized weight allowance.    Each  member  receives  a  proportionate  amount  based  on  their  weight allowance. 12.11.  Member Responsibilities. 12.11.1.    Members  must  obtain  weight  tickets  for  all  personally  procured  moves, regardless of weight allowance.  Weight tickets must include the following: 12.11.1.1.  Complete name and location of the scale. 12.11.1.2.  Date of each weighing. 12.11.1.3.  Identification of weight entries as tare, gross, or net weights. 12.11.1.4.  Company  or  carrier  identification  of  the  vehicle  or  license  number  of  POV required. 12.11.1.5.  Member’s name and last 4 of SSN. 12.11.1.6.  Axle  scale  weights  are  permitted  when  local  or  state  law  does  not  otherwise restrict them. 12.11.1.7.

Complete the Personally Procured Move Checklist and Certification of Expenses. 12.12.  Personally  Procured  Transportation  and/or  NTS  of  HHG  without  Prior Approval.  Transportation  officers  may  authorize  payment  of  monetary  allowance  when  an event beyond a member’s control prevents prior approval and issuance of DD Form 2278.  The member must have accomplished all other aspects  of the personally procured move procedures [i.e.,  obtained  necessary  weight  tickets  or  qualified  for  constructed  weight  (see  12.6.2)];  and possessed  a  valid  authority  (special  order  or  funded  housing  assignment/termination authorization)  prior  to  accomplishing  the  move  (see  12.4).    Reimbursement  of  actual  expenses incurred may be authorized when a member does not obtain weight tickets. 12.12.1.  When  a  member  did  not  obtain  necessary  weight  tickets,  the  use  of  a  constructed weight  must be  authorized and certified by the PPSO/PPPO. When PPSO/PPPO operations are contracted, the Functional Director or Quality Assurance Evaluator (QAE) (Government personnel)  having  oversight  of  the  contracted  operations  must  certify  use  of  a  constructed weight.    Reimbursement  is  limited  to  authorized  expenses  incurred  not  to  exceed  the  GCC for  the  constructed  weight  of  HHG  transported  but  not  to  exceed  the  member’s  weight allowance.  Monetary allowance is not authorized for personally procured shipments without weight tickets. 12.12.2.  Questionable  cases  may  be  forwarded  to  PPA  HQ  for  review  and  appropriate action. 12.13.  Final  Settlement/PPM  Closeout.  Operating  expense  receipts  are  not  required  for submission to finalize settlement of a personally procured move unless the expenses exceed the   70  AFI24-501  10 OCTOBER 2014 incentive.    It  is  the  member's  responsibility  to  retain  moving  expense  records  IAW  IRS regulations. 12.13.1.  In  the  event  the  PPM  is  performed  in  conjunction  with  a  Government-arranged move,  PPPO/PPSO  must  suspense  the  final  PPM  closeout  until  all  Government-arranged move(s) have been delivered and the actual weight is known in order to prevent overpayment of the PPM.  The PPPO/PPSO shall adjust the final weight on the PPM to the actual weight moved or remaining weight after the Government-arranged move(s) are subtracted from the maximum JTR weight allowance. 12.13.1.1.  When  a  PPM  is  performed  to  a  TDY  en  route  location  authorized  on  PCS order, the PPSO/PPPO at the TDY location will close out the PPM. 12.13.2.  For  members  who  separate/retire,  the  origin  PPSO/PPPOs  must  process  PPM documentation  for  final  payment  when  acceptable  weight  tickets  and  documentation  are received from the member. 12.13.3.  For active duty personnel, the destination PPSO/PPPO prepares and processes PPM documentation  for  final  payment  when  acceptable  weight  tickets  and  documentation  are turned in by the member. 12.13.4.  If  a  member  makes  a  local-vicinity  or  NTS  move,  within  or  outside  CONUS,  the PPPO/PPSO uses the rate specified in the local contract or NTS TOS times the actual weight or  member’s  remaining  weight  allowance,  whichever  is  less.    EXCEPTION:  Moves  made incident  to  JTR,  pars.  5262,  5264-A,  5264-B,  5222-A  and  5222-E  are  authorized  without regard to the member’s prescribed weight allowance. 12.13.5.

The  employee 13.2.  (5686)  Professional Books, Papers, and Equipment (PBP&E) Shipment. 13.2.1.  Policy.  The exact weight of approved professional items cannot be determined until weighed at time of pickup by a TSP or contractor. 13.2.2.  Conditions.   The employee  furnishes  an itemized inventory of the PBP&E items  to the authorizing official at the new PDS.  That official certifies the inventory, adds the correct appropriation,  and  returns  it  to  the  employee.  This  appropriation  can  be  obtained  from  the gaining  civilian  personnel  office  and/or  the  local  FSO.    The  employee  furnishes  the certification  to  the  PPPO/PPSO  to  be  made  a  part  of  the  shipment  file.    This  supports  any future  disagreement  or  rebuttal  of  excess  cost.    If  a  rebuttal  is  based  on  incorrect  PBP&E weights, copies of these documents must accompany the rebuttal to PPA HQ/ECAF. 13.2.4.  (5632)  Re-transportation of the Same HHG.  Re-transportation of the same HHG for eligible civilian employee requires authorization/approval of the responsible Headquarters of the DoD Service/Agency concerned. 13.2.5.

A cost comparison must be completed  ICW  each  PCS  order  prior  to  authorizing  a  transportation  method  on  that  PCS order.  The servicing Personal Property Shipping Office must provide the rate comparison by computing  the  cost  difference  between  the  actual  expense  and  commuted  rate  methods  of HHG transportation. 13.3.  (5656-B)  Unaccompanied Baggage. 13.3.1.  (5656-B1)  General.  Arrangements for shipment of unaccompanied baggage should be  made  as  soon  as  possible  to  minimize  the  requirement  for  expedited  movement.    This applies  when  permanent  duty  travel  is  involved.    Stateside  shipments  of  unaccompanied baggage may be included in the HHG shipment and treated as a partial delivery or shipped separately.  When included in  employees’ HHG shipment,  unaccompanied baggage MUST   74  AFI24-501  10 OCTOBER 2014 be identified  at  origin  so the TSP can describe items  on the inventory as  "designated items for extra pickup or delivery."  The cost of removing HHG from SIT for delivery to temporary lodging  for  the  purpose  of  furnishing  the  temporary  lodging  is  a  TQSE  expense  (see  par. 5808-B). 13.3.2.  Note:  Additional costs are not considered in determining an employee’s entitlement to GBL shipment versus commuted rate system (CRS) shipment. 13.3.3.  (5648)  Administrative  Restricted  HHG  Weight.

Purpose:  The  Quality  Control  (QC)  function  is  critical  to  providing  quality  personal property movement for our customers (member/employee or their authorized agent) and will be organized  to  permit  effective  use  of  resources  to  meet  this  mission.    The  extent  of  the organization  and  development  of  the  QC  section  in  the  Personal  Property  Shipping  Office (PPSO)/Personal  Property  Processing  Office  (PPPO)  depends  on  workload.    The  time  spent traveling to/from inspection areas and between inspections must be weighed against the number of inspections that can be accomplished in a day.  Transportation Officers (TO) with extensively large areas of responsibility should consider establishing a QC position physically located within the distant areas. 14.1.1.  Standard:  PPSO/PPPO will inspect 50 percent of all personal property shipments in  their  area  of  responsibility.    Credit  for  an  inspection  will  be  taken  on  the pickup/delivery  date  only  after  the  requirements  are  met  for  on-site  inspections. Telephonic  inspections  are  permitted  when  distance  or  unique  circumstances  warrant.  Inspection credit will be limited to one, regardless of the number of times a shipment is visited during pack/pickup or delivery.  Multiple visits are considered an integral part to a quality inspection. 14.2.  Inspector  Qualification:  QC Inspectors should be drawn from the ranks of military (E4 and  above)  and/or  civilian  employees  who  have  a  broad  background  in  traffic  management 2T0X1  career  fields.    Inspectors  should  limit  their  relationship  with  local  agents  and  adhere  to the Code of Ethics for Government Service and the DoD 5500.7-R, The Joint Ethics Regulation.  They must maintain a professional relationship at all times. 14.3.  Training:  TOs  must  ensure  inspectors  receive  continuous  formal/informal  training  in personal  property  and  its  associated  automated  systems.    Many  resident/nonresident  courses, seminars, and workshops are offered by various federal agencies and commercial sources to meet this requirement. 14.4.  Preparation:  Refer to DTR Appendix P for QC inspector preparation. 14.5.  Inspection of a TSP’s Facilities and Equipment. 14.5.1.  Previously Approved Facilities:  Regional Storage Management Office (RSMO) may request inspection of TSP facilities and equipment. 14.5.2.  General  Inspection Procedures  are outlined in  DOD 4500.9R, Part  IV,  Appendix D and E. 14.6.  TSP Equipment, Supplies and Personnel. 14.6.1.  Verify  the  TSP  has  adequate  equipment  and  supplies  on  hand  to  protect  the customer’s  property  from  weather  elements.    Additionally,  ensure  transport  vehicle  is  free from defects, such as holes in roof/floor and is road worthy.  Refer to DTR Appendix B for further guidance. 14.6.2.  TSP tender  of service/contractual  requirements  will  be  identified  to  the  crew  chief  or  TSP  for  corrective inefficient  or  unfamiliar  with representatives that  are AFI24-501  10 OCTOBER 2014   77  action;  this  is  especially  important  during  summer  months  when  the  TSP  may  be  using temporary personnel. 14.7.  Inspection Criteria. 14.7.1.  Origin.  The inspector will: 14.7.2.  Verify  pre-move  survey  was  accomplished  and  completion  of  approved  accessorial services  requests.  In  residence  pre-move  survey  are  conducted  on  all  domestic  shipments estimated at 4,700 pounds or more and international shipments estimated at 3,200 pounds or more within a 50-mile radius of their servicing facility. 14.7.3.  Remind the customer to segregate personal property if there are multiple shipments, and to separate PBP&E and high value items. 14.7.4.  If  it  appears  there  are  insufficient  numbers/types  of  cartons  and  pads  available,  the inspector will resolve the issue with crew chief. 14.7.5.

The customer must not sign a blank form. 14.7.9.  Remind  customers  originating  from  Gypsy  Moth  areas  of  their  responsibility  to provide  the  TSP  with  Gypsy  Moth  Inspection  Certification.

Ensure  items  serviced  or  disassembled  by  the  TSP  at  origin  are  serviced  or reassembled at destination. 14.7.17.  Verify  TSP  has  provided  customer  with  Notification  of  Loss  or  Damage  At Delivery.  Advise customer to use After Delivery forms after delivery is complete and TSP has departed the residence.  Remind customer they have 75 days from delivery to file claim. 14.7.18.  Brief customer that all packing material/cartons and debris  must be removed from the residence by TSP personnel at time of delivery, unless the unpacking of boxes is waived.  If  unpacking  is  waived,  the  customer  is  responsible  for  disposal  of  empty  cartons  and packing material.  The TSP is not required to return for debris removal unless authorized by the responsible PPSO. 14.7.19.  Advise  customer  that  upon  completion  of  delivery,  if  presented  with  a  DD  Form 619-1, they will be required to sign the form verifying accessorial services were performed.

Verify completion of approved accessorial service requests. 14.7.23.  Advise customer of mandatory completion of CSS. 14.8.  Telephonic  Inspection:  When  workload  or  distance  precludes  on-site  visits,  all  efforts will be made to perform telephonic inspections using the checklist in Attachment 14.  Telephone inspections will be an exception and not performed on a routine basis. 14.8.1.  Prior  to  initiating  a  telephonic  inspection,  the  inspector  will  determine  property location, TSP performing services, and type of shipment. 14.8.1.1.  When  calling  the  customer,  the  inspector  will  introduce  him/herself  by  name and  organization,  and  determine  if  the  TSP  has  arrived  or  left  the  pickup/delivery location.    The  inspector  will  interview  the  customer  using  the  checklist,  and  address concerns as appropriate. 14.8.1.2.  The  inspector  will  conclude  the  interview  by  thanking  the  customer  for  their time  and  will  provide  appropriate  contact  information  should  additional  assistance  be required. 14.8.1.3.  Update  DPS  with  inspection  data  and  upload  form  into  OnBase  or  TSP performance file. 14.8.1.4.  Accessorial Services: 14.8.1.5.  Inspectors  may  be  requested  to  verify  auxiliary/third  party  services,  approve and update in DPS. 14.8.2.  Crating.    Crating  of  HHG  may  be  authorized  when  normal  packaging  will  not adequately protect an item from damage during transit. Consider the type of movement when authorizing crating. An item may require crating on a van shipment but may not need a crate in a Code 2 or OCONUS containerized shipment. Requirements for crating must be closely AFI24-501  10 OCTOBER 2014   79  scrutinized  to  prevent  unnecessary  expenditure  of  funds.    The  inspector  must  use  judgment with the following guidance when approving crating: 14.8.2.1.  Only  those  items  that  have  unique  features  will  be  approved  for  crating.    For example, a grandfather clock will not be crated just because it is a clock.  Features such as  leaded  glass  or  curved  glass  panels  that  cannot  be  duplicated  without  great  expense could be justification for crating. 14.8.2.2.  Crating  furniture  items  such  as  sofas,  tables,  chairs,  and  buffets  will  not  be approved  unless  there  are  unique  features  easily  susceptible  to  damage.    A  customer’s request  to  crate  items  declared  to  be  of  extraordinary  value  is  not  enough  reason  to warrant  crating  at  Government  expense.    Large  mirrors,  pictures,  paintings  with  ornate frames,  plate  glass,  and  similar  fragile  items  that  will  not  fit  into  corrugated  “mirror” cartons may be crated. 14.8.2.3.  Items such as marble tabletops and pool table slates may be too heavy or large for available cartons and are eligible for crating. 14.8.2.4.  Special  services  not  approved  by  the  PPSO/PPPO  can  be  requested  by,  and furnished  to,  the  customer.    These  include  premium  packing  and  crating  not  otherwise required by a TSP to protect an item.  The customer is financially responsible for all costs associated with these special services directly with TSP. 14.8.2.5.  Debris Removal: Debris Removal Service is utilized by exception only.  Some exceptions  normally  approved:  Bluebark,  Wounded  Warrior  Program,  deployed  spouse when member is deployed, etc. 14.8.2.6.  (400NG  Item  225)  Pick up/delivery self/mini storage:  Removing items from or placing items into self/mini storage warehouses is a member responsibility.  In certain instances  (such  as  Bluebark,  deployed  spouse,  Wounded  Warrior,  etc),  PPSOs  may approve  additional  services  to  allow  the  TSP  to  enter  the  warehouse  for  purpose  of removing/placing items. 14.8.2.7.  (400NG Item 35)  Third party servicing:  Third Party Servicing (TPS) does not apply  to  the  disassembly/assembly  of  an  item  that  does  not  require  any  servicing.  TPS applies when that same item in question would require servicing, i.e. grandfather clocks, pool  tables,  etc.  In  those  cases  TPS  allows  you  to  approve  the  servicing  and disassembly/assembly of such items. 14.8.2.8.  (400NG  Item  130)  Bulky articles: Items must be specifically listed in current tariffs/tenders for compensation as a bulky article.  At no time will items be lumped into a category due to their size or similarity to bulky articles listed in tariffs/tenders. front-load  washers: 14.8.2.9.  Servicing requires stabilizing/securing  of  the  wash  drum  during  transit,  third  party  service  will  not  be authorized.  The  transportation  charge  includes  purchasing/providing  necessary  bolts  or other suitable related products and installation of these products at origin, as well as the removal  of  the  bolts/related  products  used  to  stabilize  the  drum,  upon  delivery  at destination. If  a  front load  washer 14.9.  Infestation/Unsanitary  Conditions:  When  TSP  refuses  to  proceed  with  packing  due  to infestation  or  unsanitary  conditions,  an  inspector  will  discuss  the  issue  with  the  customer  and   80  AFI24-501  10 OCTOBER 2014 TSP  to  resolve  the  situation.    In  the  case  of  infestation/unsanitary  condition,  fumigation  and clean  up  is  the  customer  responsibility  prior  to  loading.    However,  if  the  TSP  discovers infestation after pickup it is the TSP’s responsibility to fumigate shipment. 14.9.1.  Note:  Ultimately,  the  TSP  makes  the  determination  whether  or  not  to  continue packing until the issue is resolved. 14.10.  Witnessed  Weighing/Reweighs/Constructive  Weights:  Inspectors  will  on  occasion witness  the  weighing/reweighing  of  personal  property  shipments.    Shipments  should  be randomly selected with an emphasis on those shipments in excess of customer entitlement.  The inspector must: 14.10.1.  Validate weigh scales are certified and the scale’s operator is licensed or otherwise qualified. 14.10.2.  Observe that the truck is properly positioned on the scale while obtaining both tare and gross weights. 14.10.3.  Annotate and sign all copies of the weight ticket(s) reflecting weigh and/or reweigh was witnessed. 14.10.4.  There  are  no  provisions  for  approving  constructive  weights  resulting  from  lost weight tickets. 14.11.  Mobile  Homes:  Inspection  for  Government-arranged  mobile  home  moves  will  comply with the guidelines in paragraph 14.1.  The inspector will: 14.11.1.  Verify TSP is in receipt of the DD Form 1800, Mobile Home Inspection Record and has conducted origin and/or destination mobile home inspection as applicable.  If directed by the TO, the inspector will perform a visual inspection of the mobile home using the DD Form 1800. 14.11.2.  Ensure  the  TSP  has  prepared  DD  Form  1412,  Inventory  of  Articles  Shipped  in House Trailer and distributes it in accordance with the rate solicitation. 14.11.3.  Upon delivery, verify that the customer received a DD Form 1840/1840R, Loss or Damage Report from  the TSP for use in  documenting loss or damage to personal  property.  Loss or damage to the mobile home is documented on the reverse of the DD Form 1800. 14.11.4.  The original copy will be provided to the member or the member’s agent.  The form will either be delivered by the inspector during the destination inspection (if one is made), or mailed to the member within 5 workdays after the delivery.  At destination, ensure customer has received DD Form  1799, Report on TSP Performance Mobile Home from PPSO/PPPO and is instructed to return the completed form to the PPSO/PPPO within 10 workdays. 14.12.  Post-Inspection Duties: 14.12.1.  Upon  completion  of  daily  inspections,  the  inspector  will  complete  appropriate shipment evaluation and inspection documents and will initiate/follow-up on discrepancies as required. 14.12.2.  The inspector will record and maintain data pertaining to the number of shipments eligible for inspection and those actually inspected.  PPPOs are responsible for maintaining inspection metrics and reporting as required. AFI24-501  10 OCTOBER 2014   81  14.13.  Day to Day Workload: 14.13.1.  In  day  to  day  workload,  inspectors  can  expect  to  face  numerous  challenges  not clearly  addressed  or  referenced  throughout  transportation  or  Services  regulations,  such  as:  use of totes, shipment of alcoholic beverages, after-the-fact declaration of PBP&E/SPBP&E, shipments with mold/mildew issues, TSP personnel qualifications, measurement of oversize items, etc. 14.13.2.  Totes:  Repacking of totes is at the discretion of the TSP.  If items are packed by the member in plastic or similar type containers, the TSP may pack the containers in an approved carton,  if  a  carton  is  available  that  will  accommodate  the  container.  If  the  plastic  container cannot  be  packed  in  an  approved  carton,  TSP  will  empty  and  pack  the  contents  into  an appropriate,  approved  carton;  then  empty  plastic  container  will  be  wrapped  in  pads  for protection. 14.13.3.  Alcoholic  beverages  (5208-G):  TSPs  have  discretion  to  accept/not  accept  for shipment.    Furthermore  individual  state  and  county  restrictions  may  apply.  Members  must ensure alcoholic beverage movement complies with 27 USC 122. 14.13.4.  PBP&E/SPBP&E:  Refer to paragraph 2.1.3 of this supplement for guidance. 14.13.5.  Mold/mildew:  The DTR currently does not contain guidance for resolving possible mold/mildew  contamination  within  shipments.    Inspectors  may  be  asked  to  identify  a mold/mildew issue at time of pickup or delivery.  When mold/mildew issues are validated the following steps shall be taken: 14.13.5.1.  Pickup.  Inspectors  shall  make  every  effort  to  go  the  pickup  site  when contacted  by  the  member/releasing  agent  or  TSP  to  validate  mold/mildew  issues.  TSPs are  not  required  to  pick  up  any  property  that  may  contaminate  the  shipment,  other shipments or their equipment/warehouse facility. 14.13.5.2.  Delivery: contamination of inbound shipments they will take the following steps: inspectors  are  notified  of  possible  mold/mildew   When 14.13.5.3.  Prior  to  delivery  to  warehouse  facility/residence:    Inspector  will  make  every effort  to  validate  possible  mold/mildew  contamination  within  shipment  by  observing exterior containers, cartons, or personal property.  Inspector will ensure responsible TSP is notified and property is not offloaded and remains on vehicle.  TSP is responsible for ensuring other shipments are not integrated with the mold/mildew property.  Further, TSP is  responsible  to  mitigate  mold/mildew  contamination,  contact  qualified  agency  for cleaning affected property and offer for delivery once complete. 14.13.5.4.  After delivery to warehouse facility:  See guidance in 14.13.5.3. 14.13.5.5.  At delivery to residence:  Inspector will make every effort to validate possible mold/mildew  contamination  and  stop  offload  if  in  progress.    Additionally,  ensure responsible TSP is contacted and contaminated property that has been offloaded or placed in  residence  is  reloaded  onto  TSP  equipment.    Inspector  may  authorize  labor  for  re-handling  of  contaminated  property.   See  guidance  in  para  14.13.5.3  for  TSP responsibilities.   82  AFI24-501  10 OCTOBER 2014 14.13.5.6.  After delivery to residence:  For shipments recently delivered, members must identify mold/mildew damage on after delivery claim form and immediately contact the TSP for resolution.

SHIPMENT OF HOUSEHOLD GOODS (HHG):  My entitlement to ship HHG at Government expense will terminate unless HHG are turned over to a Traffic Management Officer or to a carrier for shipment within 180-days of the effective date of my separation (unless extended as provided in paragraph 3 below).   a.  The Joint Federal Travel Regulation (JTR) authorizes me shipment of ____________  lbs of my HHG to my Home of Record (HOR) or the Place where I Entered Active Duty (PLEAD).  b.  Multiple shipments or shipments to location(s) other than PLEAD or HOR, may incur excess cost payable by me.  c.  If ordered to a CONUS separation station on an AF Form 899 (PCS Order), I may ship HHG from overseas to the processing station.  However, if I take possession of these HHG, the Government will not transport the HHG to my PLEAD or HOR.  d.  I understand that once I ship HHG to my PLEAD or HOR, I will no longer be authorized to place HHG into Non-Temporary Storage (NTS).  I will only be authorized Storage in Transit (SIT) up to 90 days.    e.  Members residing in Government controlled quarters who are in receipt of separation orders and are required by competent authority to vacate these quarters are entitled to a local move of HHG using the separation order.  This does not constitute a PLEAD or HOR move.  2.  NON-TEMPORARY STORAGE (NTS) OF HHG:  If I choose not to ship my HHG to a PLEAD or HOR at this time, I may place my HHG into NTS at Government expense within my 180 day period.  The entitlement to NTS at Government expense terminates 180 days after the effective date of separation.  HHG already in NTS may continue in NTS at my expense using Government rates until expiration of this entitlement.  However, if HHGs are in NTS as “excess to Government housing” this storage lot must be converted to my separation order.  3.  EXTENSIONS:  The time limits noted above may be extended if approved by the Secretarial Process for a bona fide hardship, educational requirement, medical problems, or other deserving circumstances.  Procedures for extensions applications are:  IMMEDIATE:  Prior to expiration of my PLEAD or HOR entitlement, I must submit a letter to the closest Transportation Officer for a 15-workday extension following the scheduled pickup date.  This extension only applies when hardship occurs after shipping arrangements have been made, but before the schedule date services are to be performed.  MEDICAL / EDUCATION / OTHER REASONS BEYOND MEMBER’S CONTROL (ORBMC):  Recommend you submit a letter requesting an extension prior to expiration of your  PLEAD or HOR entitlement to PPA HQ/ECAF-B, 2261 Hughes Ave, Ste 159, Lackland AFB TX  78236-9857, e-mail hqppa.ecaf-ext@us.af.mil or fax (210) 321-4263.
