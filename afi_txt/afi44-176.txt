Definition  of  Access  To  Care  (ATC)  Management.  ATC  management  encompasses  a myriad  of  MTF  functions  and  is  an  integral  part  of  inpatient  and  outpatient,  primary  and specialty  healthcare  delivery.  ATC  management  includes,  but  is  not  limited  to:  day-to-day management of templating, scheduling, and appointing functions, including appointments made by  telephone,  in-person,  electronic  secure  messaging,  and  web-based  capabilities;  information systems  management,  including  provider  file  and  table  building,  and  clinic/provider  profile management;  empanelment,  demand  management  and  analysis;  referral  management  activities; appointing telephony management; and effective and efficient personnel management in support of  this  mission.  ATC  also  includes  the  concept  of  Enhanced  Access  which  encompasses healthcare  management  of  the  patient  by  the  entire  healthcare  team  through  the  use  of  clinical support staff and non-traditional face-to-face physician/provider visits. Under Enhanced Access, the healthcare team is expanded to include Clinical Pharmacists, Behavioral Health Optimization Program  (BHOP)  providers,  the  Base  Operational  Medical  Cell  (BOMC),  and  Medical Management  (MM)  personnel.    Enhanced  Access  includes  the  use  of  Secure  Messaging  (SM), the Nurse Advice Line (NAL), telemedicine, and direct access Physical Therapy (PT). Enhanced Access will be incorporated into the MTF ATC strategy. 1.2.  Goal of ATC Management.  The goal of ATC management is to implement and sustain a systematic, proactive, programmatic, and responsive access program for all clinics and services across the MTF. MTFs must ensure appointment access meets the standards as stated in Title 32 Code  of  Federal  Regulations  199.17,  implemented  by  the  Office  of  the  Secretary  of  Defense (OSD)  in  Department  of  Defense  Instruction  (DoDI)  6025.20  (Medical  Management  (MM) Programs  in  the  Direct  Care  System  (DCS)  and  Remote  Areas).  The  desired  outcome  is  the patient  is  provided  the  right  healthcare  service,  at  the  right  time,  in  the  right  setting  within  a patient centric, not staff centric focus. The right setting may include over the phone, in the office, or virtually, and it may be with a provider other than a physician. (T-0) 1.3.  Objectives  of  ATC  Management.  The  objectives  of  ATC  management  are  to  deliver patient-centric  access  to  services, meet  mission requirements, and satisfy  the wellness  needs of beneficiaries.  Specifically, the AFMS’ access objectives are to: 1.3.1.  Provide access to healthcare services/appointments within access standards. 1.3.2.  Achieve patient and staff satisfaction. 1.3.3.  Provide a patient-centered, first call resolution appointment system. 1.3.4.  Implement Enhanced Access strategies. 1.3.5.  Maximize patient-provider continuity. 1.3.6.  Meet the healthcare needs of beneficiaries.   AFI44-176  8 SEPTEMBER 2017 7 1.4.  Health  Insurance  Portability  and  Accountability  Act  (HIPAA)  Compliance.  MTFs must ensure ATC Management functions comply with the HIPAA privacy and security programs and  national  standards,  including  compliance  with  DOD  6025.18-R,  DOD  Health  Information Privacy  Regulation,  DOD  8580.02-R,  DOD  Health  Information  Security  Regulation,  or  as superseded by new or revised HIPAA privacy or security regulations and instructions.

Schedule  management forecasting, implementation,  management  and  analysis  of  provider  and  clinical  staff  schedules  to  meet patient demand. encompasses continuous planning, 3.2.  Planning and Forecasting. 3.2.1.  The  MTF  will  maintain  a  rolling  180-day  schedule  to  ensure  adequate  provider  and clinic  staff  availability  to  meet  patient  demand  within  access  standards.  (T-0)  Consider  the following in schedule development:  historical patient utilization patterns, leave, TDY, base exercises, down days, etc. 3.2.2.  The  AMT  will  analyze  patient  demand  utilizing  the  measures  listed  in  para  2.2.4 above  and  others  as  needed.  (T-2)    Effective  management  of  appointments  will  maximize patient access to the MTF and avoid purchased care leakage. 3.3.  Implementation and Management. 3.3.1.  Primary  and  specialty  care  clinics  will  provide  a  minimum  of  180-calendar  days  of available appointments for booking at all times. (T-0) 3.3.1.1.  Graduate Medical Education (GME) residents and their preceptors will provide a minimum of 60-calendar days of available appointments for booking at all times. (T-0) 3.3.1.2.  Primary and specialty clinics shall not use the dollar sign appointment types. (T-1)  Use  of  dollar  sign  appointment  types  prevents  the  appointment  from  being  booked, thus limiting patient access to care. 3.3.2.  The  Template  Manager  (TM)  will  have  written  processes  for  appointment  schedule change requests with the goal of minimizing frequent/repeated changes to opened schedules, changes  causing  facility  cancellations,  rescheduling  of  patients,  etc.  (T-3)  This  process should be automated, as functionality to auto-reconfigure appointments exists in CHCS. 3.3.3.  Primary Care clinics will convert unbooked FTR appointments to 24HR appointments no later than (NLT) 24 hours prior to the scheduled appointment time. (T-2) 3.3.4.  The  TM  will  release/delete  unbookable  appointments  (FROZ,  WAIT,  HOLD,  etc.) NLT 48 hours prior to the clinic day in which the unbookable appointments were scheduled. (T-2) Appointments will be set up to auto-reconfigure. 3.3.5.  The  TM  will  not  delete  unbooked  or  unused  appointment  slots  from  the  appointing system. (T-1) 3.3.6.  The  TM  will  review  the  next  clinic  day’s  appointment  availability  and  mix  daily  to ensure schedules meet patient demand and are adjusted as needed. (T-2)   12 3.4.  Analysis. AFI44-176  8 SEPTEMBER 2017 3.4.1.  The GPM will analyze unfilled appointments to determine the root causes of non-use through the use of available ATC Tools such as the TRICARE Operations Center (TOC) and Direct Access Reporting Tool (DART). (T-3)  The MTF should consider factors such as type of  appointment,  time  appointment  offered,  purchased  care  leakage  for  the  same  services, detail codes restrictions, etc. 3.4.2.  The GPM will analyze published schedules to determine the effectiveness of meeting patient  demand  relative  to  the  quantity  of  appointments:  time  of  available  appointments, over/under  supply  of  appointment  mix,  seasonality  impacts,  cancellations,  no-shows, schedule changes, etc. (T-3) This includes those clinics that offer sick call appointments. AFI44-176  8 SEPTEMBER 2017 13 Chapter 4 TEMPLATE MANAGEMENT 4.1.  Template Management. 4.1.1.  MTFs  will  construct  templates  and  schedules  using  the  MHS  Standard  Appointment types  (see  Table  5.1).    Definitions  can  be  found  on  the  AFMS  Knowledge  Exchange  (Kx) ATC  page.  MTFs  using  MHS  GENESIS  will  follow  appointing  procedures  for  MHS GENESIS. 4.1.2.  Primary  care  provider  templates  will  be  created  IAW  AFI  44-171  and  will  meet forecasted patient demand for healthcare access. (T-2) 4.2.  Use of Detail Codes. 4.2.1.  MTFs  may  use  detail  codes  to  further  define  appointment  types  on  templates  and schedules, IAW approved detail code list in MHS Guide for Access Success. 4.2.2.  MTFs will use the tri-service approved operational definitions of detail codes. (T-2) 4.3.  TRICARE Online (TOL) Web Enabled Detail Code. 4.3.1.  Appointments,  by  default,  are  web  enabled.  MTFs  will  ensure  at  least  80  percent  of appointments in Family Health, Pediatrics, Internal Medicine, Flight Medicine Primary Care clinics and Optometry clinics are web enabled. (T-0) 4.4.  Provider Book Only (PBO) Detail Code. 4.4.1.  In  Primary  Care  clinics,  the  MTF  will  limit  the  use  of  the  PBO  detail  code  to  those appointments in  excess  of required centrally bookable appointment levels for AFMH,  IAW AFI 44-171. (T-2) 4.4.2.  For initial  specialty  care referral  appointments, the MTF will not  use the PBO detail code. (T-2)  4.5.  Patient Access Type Detail Codes. 4.5.1.  MTFs will use no more than two patient access type detail codes per appointment slot. (T-3) This ensures appointing personnel correctly identify the eligible beneficiary category of patient per TRICARE policy to be booked into a particular slot. (T-1) 14 AFI44-176  8 SEPTEMBER 2017 Chapter 5 APPOINTING 5.1.  Appointment Management. 5.1.1.  The MTF medical clinics will use the MHS electronic patient scheduling appointment system to schedule patient appointments. (T-1) 5.1.2.  MTF will provide equal priority access for TRICARE Prime beneficiaries not enrolled to the MTF as for those enrolled to the MTF, US Family Health Plan enrollees may be seen on a space available basis, IAW 32 CFR Sec. 199.17. (T-0) Prioritize according to Title 32 CFR  199.17  (d)(1)  and  Health  Affairs  Policy  11-005:  Active  Duty  Family  Members (ADFMs) in Prime have priority access, followed by Retirees, etc. 5.1.3.  The  MTF  staff  who  book  patient  appointments  will  match  the  patient’s  request  for care with the appropriate ATC category. (T-0) 5.2.  Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) Checks. 5.2.1.  The  MTF  staff  will  complete  a  DEERS  eligibility  check  and  patient  demographic information  verification  (current  address  and  current  telephone  number)  at  each  patient interface  (e.g.,  booking  via  telephone  or  in  person,  telephone  consultation  requests,  and check-in  by  a  patient  for  any  appointments,  etc.).  The  only  exception  is  for  telephone contacts made by/to providers. (T-0) 5.2.2.  Patient  eligibility  for care and enrollment  status  should be addressed by TOPA  IAW AFI 41-210, TRICARE Operations and Patient Administration Functions. 5.3.  ATC Categories. 5.3.1.  Appointing  personnel  will  select  one  of  the  ATC  categories  (see  Table  5.1)  in  the CHCS  appointing  search  function  in  order  to  book  scheduled  appointments.  (T-1)  The appropriate  ATC  standard  is  based  on  the  timeline  of  the  patient’s  request  for  care  or provider directive. MTFs using MHS GENESIS will follow appointing procedures for MHS GENESIS.   AFI44-176  8 SEPTEMBER 2017 15 Table 5.1.  Military Health System (MHS) Standard Appointment Types. MHS Standard Appointment Type Timeline of Patient’s Request for Care (ATC Standard) ATC Category/ CHCS Search Options 24HR  WELL  SPEC  PROC  FTR  GRP  24 Continuous Hours/1440 minutes 28 Calendar Days/40,320 minutes Acute Wellness 28 Calendar Days/40,320 minutes, or per Provider Designation not to exceed 28 Calendar days    Specialty No Standard or per Provider Designation Future 5.4.  Simplified Appointing. 5.4.1.  All Primary Care clinics using the BAA, BDA, BDB, BGA and BJA Medical Expense and  Performance  Reporting  System  (MEPRS)  codes  will  utilize  the  Simplified  Appointing model  in  provider  schedules.  The  24HR,  FTR,  SPEC,  PROC  and  GRP  appointment  types will be used as described below. (T-0) 5.4.2.  For most MTFs, a Primary Care schedule with a minimum of 50/50 mix of 24HR and FTR  appointments  provides  optimal  access  to  meet  patient  demand.  MTFs  should  utilize demand management  forecasting  and available demand forecasting tools  such as the Direct Access  Reporting  Tool  (DART)  to  determine  the  appropriate  mix  of  appointments  and  to adjust schedules as needed to provide a patient-centric supply of appointments. 5.4.3.  Group  Practice  Managers  will  maximize  the  use  of  the  24HR  and  FTR  appointment types  in  Primary  Care  templates  and  schedules.  (T-0)    Only  SPEC,  PROC  and  GRP appointment  types  may  be  added  to  the  schedule  to  support  provider  practice  patterns. However,  use  of  these  appointment  types  should  be  consistent  with  AFI  44-171  bookable appointments  requirements  and  be  complementary  to  maximize  24HR  and  FTR  access  to care. 5.4.4.  Definitions of Simplified Appointing Appointment Types. 5.4.4.1.  24HR:  primarily used for patient care conditions requiring care within 24 hours of  the  request.  It  may  also  be  used  for  non-urgent  patient  conditions,  but  must  be balanced  with  urgency  and  availability;  this  process  will  be  described  in  the  MTF appointing  protocols.  To  the  greatest  extent  possible,  appointing  staff  will  fill  all  open 24HR  slots  on  a  daily  basis.  Appointments  will  not  be  limited  to  “one  complaint”  or medical issue, but rather will address all patient concerns that can be adequately covered in  the time allotted to  minimize the need for unnecessary future appointments or repeat visits.   16 AFI44-176  8 SEPTEMBER 2017 5.4.4.2.  FTR:  used for patients requesting non-urgent services beyond 24 hours (such as for routine, wellness and follow-up care). The FTR appointment type will not be used for initial specialty (SPEC) appointments. To the greatest extent possible, appointments will not  be  limited  to  “one  complaint”  or  medical  issue,  but  rather  will  address  all  patient concerns  that  can  be  adequately  covered  in  the  time  allotted  to  minimize  the  need  for unnecessary future appointments or repeat visits. 5.4.4.3.  SPEC:  used for an initial consult/referral appointment. It may also be used for a patient initiated  self-referral  appointment.  The  CHCS  appointing  system  will automatically assign the ATC Standard and Category that matches the referral’s clinical priority entered by the requesting provider. 5.4.4.4.  PROC:    used  for  patients  in  need  of  medical  procedures.  A  procedure appointment will be booked and seen with a provider within 28 calendar days or per the provider's designation. Within Primary Care clinics, a referral is generally not required. If the PROC appointment is not performed within the patient’s medical home, a referral will be required. 5.4.4.5.  GRP:  used for patients who require therapy, counseling, or teaching encounters where a provider will perform the service in a group setting. The detail code fields can be used  to  provide  further  information  about  the  care  to  be  provided  in  the  group appointment, (e.g., TOBCES for a Tobacco Cessation Class). A group appointment may be scheduled per self-referral of the patient, or the clinic's or referring provider's policy or designation. 5.4.5.  Measurement.    The  following  strategic  measures  will  be  utilized  to  measure  the success of Simplified Appointing (T-1): Table 5.2.  Appointment Measures. Measure Target Report Location Prospective Measures 3RD Available 24HR Appointment ≤ 1.0 days 3RD Available FTR Appointment ≤ 7.0 days   3RD Available SPEC Appointment ≤ 28.0 days   3RD Available WELL Appointment ≤ 28.0 days TRICARE Operations Center (TOC), Third Available Report Monthly TOC, Third Available Report Monthly TOC, Third Available Report Monthly TOC, Third Available Report Monthly      AFI44-176  8 SEPTEMBER 2017 17 Retrospective Measures Average Days to Be Seen (Acute search) Average Days to Be Seen (Future search) 5.5.  Booking Transactions. ≤ 1.0 days ≤ 14.0 days TOC, Access to Care Summary Report TOC, Access to Care Summary Report  5.5.1.  MTFs will use the access category search that best represents the patient's request. (T-0) 5.5.2.  MTFs will waive ATC standards should patients request appointments outside of ATC standards  for  provider  continuity/convenience/personal  reasons,  even  though  the  MTF  may have appointments available inside ATC Standards with their PCM or other providers in the team/clinic.  (T-1)  MTFs  will  not  use  ‘Just  Looking’  feature  in  CHCS  to  search  for appointments. 5.5.3.  Patients  Refusing  All  Appointment  Times  Offered.  Appointing  personnel  will document  patient  refusals  in  CHCS,  IAW  current  CHCS  information  system  processes  to ensure  it  reflects  the  reason  a  patient  refused  all  appointment  times  offered  as  opposed  to accepting an appointment within ATC standards. (T-3) 5.5.4.  Unbooked Appointment Request Functionality. Appointing personnel will choose the most accurate Unbooked Appointment Request as defined in the current MHS access to care guide. (T-3) 5.6.  Continuity List Patients. 5.6.1.  Continuity List (CL) patients are those high-acuity patients who must be seen by their provider due to the risk in both outcome, and/or unnecessary deferral to the network. 5.6.2.  PCM  Teams  in  Primary  Care  will  develop  and  maintain  a  current  list  of  their continuity patients IAW AFI 44-171. 5.6.3.  Patients  identified  as  CL  patients  will  be  identified  by  [CL]  in  the  remarks  field  of CHCS. These patients will be offered a continuity appointment as outlined in AFI 44-171. 5.7.  First Call Resolution. 5.7.1.  MTFs  will  not  divert  patients  to  the  NAL  during  business  hours  as  a  means  to complete first call resolution. (T-1) 5.7.2.  Appointing agents will: 5.7.2.1.  Search  for  appointments  with  the  patient's  PCM.  If  no  appointments  are available, the agent will search within the PCM Team, then PCM Clinic, then across all Primary  Care  clinics  (this  includes  cross-booking  into  the  following  MEPRS:  BAA  - Internal Medicine, BDA - Pediatrics, BGA- Family Health, BJA – Flight Medicine). (T-1) 18 AFI44-176  8 SEPTEMBER 2017 5.7.2.2.  If unable to  find an appropriate appointment for the patient,  transfer the  call  to the patient's PCM team nurse or a designated clinic triage nurse, via warm hand-off, for triage and appropriate disposition. (T-1) 5.7.2.3.  If  unable  to  warm-handoff  the  patient  to  the  PCM  team  nurse,  enter  a  high priority T-CON (red in AHLTA) to the team indicating the need for a two-hour response. (T-1) 5.7.3.  PCM Team nurses will: 5.7.3.1.  Take  warm  hand-off  calls  from  appointing  agents  and  determine  the  most appropriate disposition. (T-1) 5.7.3.2.  When warm hand-offs are not possible, reply to RED TCONs within two hours. (T-1) 5.7.3.3.  Ensure Active Duty patients are deferred to the network only as a last resort. (T-1) 5.7.3.4.  MTFs  will  use  the  Un-booked  Appointment  Request/Reporting  functionality  in CHCS to allow for the tracking and reporting of patients who requested an appointment, a  search  was  performed  by  an  appointing  agent,  but  the  appointment  request  did  not result in a booked appointment. (T-3) 5.8.  Left Without Being Seen (LWOBS). 5.8.1.  A patient who has a booked appointment, arrives at the clinic, and is checked in, but leaves without seeing the provider. 5.9.  No-Shows. 5.9.1.  The  MTF  will  designate  an  appointment  a  no-show  when  a  patient  does  not  keep  a scheduled appointment or cancels within 2 business hours of the appointment. Commanders will publish and market the AFMS no-show standard to all MTF staff and beneficiaries and ensure it is applied throughout the MTF to enable a consistent patient experience. (T-3) If a patient  is  designated  a  no-show  by  cancelling  within  2  business  hours  of  the  appointment, every effort will be made to utilize the now unfilled appointment. 5.9.1.1.  An individual clinic’s no-show rate will not exceed five (5) percent of all booked appointments.  (T-1)  Specialty  care  clinics  no-show  rates  will  be  IAW  Chapter  11, Specialty Care. 5.9.1.2.  The  MTF  will  use  the  following  formula  to  calculate  the  no-show  percentage  (T-1): # No-Shows                                                                           (LWOBS + Kept + No Show + Pending)* – (Facility Cancelled + Patient Cancelled)  *all booked appointments 5.9.1.3.  Providers,  clinical  staff  and  appointment  line  staff  will  attempt  to  contact  (e.g. voicemail, secure messaging, written letters, etc.) no-show and Left Without Being Seen (LWOBS)  patients  at  least  once  to  ensure  patient  wellness/safety.  All  attempts  will  be documented in the Electronic Health Record (EHR). (T-3)  AFI44-176  8 SEPTEMBER 2017 19 5.10.  Late Patient Arrival for Scheduled Appointment (Late-Show)  . 5.10.1.  MTF Commanders will publish and market a single late-show policy to all MTF staff and  beneficiaries,  and  will  ensure  it  is  applied  throughout  the  MTF  to  enable  a  consistent patient experience. (T-3) Patients who arrive at the clinic greater than 10 minutes after their scheduled appointment time are considered late. Every effort will be made to accommodate late showed patients. 5.11.  Patient Cancellations. 5.11.1.  MTFs will establish a separate cancellation telephone number/call tree option that is available/open  24  hours  a  day,  seven  days  a  week  to  capture  patients’  appointment cancellation requests. (T-3) The phone number  will be clearly published on MTF websites, appointment  line  messages,  phone  books  and  other  communications.  TRICARE  Online (TOL),  Secure  Messaging,  and  e-mail  appointment  cancellation  notifications  do  not  fulfill this requirement. 5.11.2.  MTFs  will  develop  an  ongoing  process  in  which  cancellations  (via  automated appointment  reminder,  secure  message,  etc)  are  translated  back  into  the  appointing information system thus, making cancelled appointments available for booking. (T-3) 5.12.  Facility Cancellations. 5.12.1.  MTFs will establish processes to minimize facility cancellations. (T-3) 5.12.2.  MTFs  will  establish  schedule  management  processes  to  govern  the  facility cancellation  process  to  include:  approval  authority;  conditions  when  facility  cancellation  is allowed (e.g., emergency  weather conditions);  and reporting and tracking of occurrences to the  MTF  AMT.  (T-3)  Mental  Health  patients  who  are  on  the  High  Interest  List  (and  are therefore at elevated risk for harm or behavioral issues) are required to speak with a provider prior to cancelling an appointment IAW AFI 44-172, Mental Health. (T-1) 5.12.3.  MTFs shall notify affected patients of their facility cancelled appointment within one business day of the facility cancellation.  One business day includes the facility cancellation date plus the end of the next business day. (T-3) 5.12.4.  MTFs’  facility  cancellation  rate  shall  not  exceed  three  percent  of  all  booked appointments.  MTFs  will  use  the  below  formula  to  calculate  the  facility  cancellation  rate:  (T-2) # Facility Cancelled _____________________________________________________ (LWOBS + Kept + Facility Cancelled + No shows + Pending)*   *number of patients who were booked appointments 5.13.  Appointing Data Quality/End of Day Processing. 5.13.1.  At the end of each business day, clinics will complete CHCS end of day processing.  (T-3) 5.13.2.  Clinic staff will: 5.13.2.1.

Information  Management  (IM)  (i.e.  Composite  Health  Care  System  (CHCS) administrator and/or Chief Information Officer (CIO)) will: 8.3.8.1.  Ensure CHCS accounts are activated or deactivated per guidance of the Defense Health Agency (DHA) NAL PMO. 26 AFI44-176  8 SEPTEMBER 2017 8.3.8.2.  Ensure  scheduled  and  unscheduled  CHCS  and  Application  Virtualization Hosting Environment (AVHE) outages are reported to the NAL. 8.3.8.3.  Be prepared to receive account activation and deactivation notifications from the DHA NAL PMO to facilitate access of NAL staff. 8.4.  NAL Sustainment Guidance. 8.4.1.  The NAL may be used as a PCM designee to respond to patient urgent care needs 24 hours a day, 7 days  a week.  Facilities that use the NAL do not  need to  identify an on-call provider for this purpose. 8.5.  Training. 8.5.1.  To  ensure  continuity  within  the  MTF,  NAL  should  be  included  in  all  orientation checklists for executive leadership and work-centers (i.e. AFMH clinics, appointing centers, TOPA,  Information  Management-CHCS  administrator,  medical  management  team,  etc.) involved in decision making, workflow and training processes. 8.5.2.  Refresher  training  should  be  conducted  at  least  once  a  year  to  ensure  key  personnel are  fully  aware  of  all  changes  to  NAL  strategic  goals,  program  dynamics,  and  workflow processes. 8.6.  Guidance on Beneficiary Initiated Contact with MTF. 8.6.1.  During normal operations, MTF personnel will not redirect beneficiaries to the NAL as a substitute for their ability to access their AFMH teams. (T-1) 8.6.2.  If the patient states they want to speak to  a nurse, the NAL should not be chosen by MTF staff as the primary option over the beneficiary’s PCM team’s nurse. 8.6.3.  If resources are available to provide walk-ins, MTFs will not redirect beneficiaries to the NAL. 8.6.4.  It  is  appropriate for patients  to  be transferred to  the NAL upon the patient’s request; however,  MTF  personnel  cannot  transfer  or  tell  the  beneficiaries  to  call  the  NAL  if  the individual prefers to seek care with their AFMH team. 8.6.5.  Beneficiaries  have  the  option  to  utilize  NAL  services  24  hours  a  day,  seven  days  a week. 8.7.  Guidance on Warm Handoffs. 8.7.1.  The  MTF  will  designate  phone  line(s)  and  develop  workflows  (how  the  MTF  routes calls and provides support staff for maximum effectiveness) to receive NAL warm handoffs. Per the AFMS NAL Operational Guidance, signed June 2016, a warm handoff is when one party  telephonically  connects  the  beneficiary  with  another  party  and  both  parties  verbally accept the exchange of the beneficiary via the phone line. 8.7.2.  The workflow and telephonic resources must support personnel’s capability to answer the NAL call within 45 seconds. 8.7.3.  When the NAL RN triages the patient and if an appointment is needed, the NAL clerk first attempts to book the patient in CHCS, and if not successful, there is an attempt by the NAL to make a warm-handoff to the MTF. AFI44-176  8 SEPTEMBER 2017 27 8.7.4.  Personnel assigned to answer the designated warm handoff phone line must be aware of  MTF’s  access  goals  and  current  access  capacity,  i.e.  providers  available,  ability  to  cross book    within  the  team  or  across  teams;  hours  of  the  UCC/ED  (if  available)  and  other applicable  access to care protocols during the time of the call. 8.7.5.  It  is  suggested  that  weekly  telephonic  technical  quality  assurance  inspections  be performed to ensure full functionality of designated line(s). 8.8.  CHCS and Application Virtualization Hosting Environment (AVHE) Guidance. 8.8.1.1.  The MTF must provide CHCS account access to NAL nursing staff/clerks.  This provides the NAL appointment booking capability into the MTF’s CHCS platform. 8.8.1.2.  The NAL clerks must be given booking access to all AFMH clinics, to include Family  Medicine,  Pediatric,  Internal  Medicine,  Flight  Medicine,  and  Personnel Reliability Program. 8.8.1.3.  The MTF staff must ensure NAL profiles are developed to support cross booking capability, first to  the PCM, then to  the PCM Team,  then to  the PCM clinic in  order to recapture the greatest amount of care possible. 8.9.  Guidance on Clinic & MTF Closures. 8.9.1.  All Clinic and/or MTF closures due to training, weather, etc. must be reported to the NAL. 8.9.1.1.  This  enables  the  NAL  to  appropriately  support  and/or  route  calls  from  MTF beneficiaries during closure.  Additionally, it helps to reduce skewed data related to the unsuccessful  warm  handoff  performance  metrics.    If  the  NAL  is  aware  of  the  closure, they won’t unnecessarily attempt a warm handoff. 8.10.  Marketing Guidance. 8.10.1.  An effective MTF marketing campaign will enable beneficiaries to establish realistic expectations  of  NAL  services  and  enhance  comprehension  of  rules  of  engagement contributing to customer satisfaction. 8.10.2.  Marketing tools and examples are located on the NAL Kx page. 28 AFI44-176  8 SEPTEMBER 2017 Chapter 9 REFERRAL MANAGEMENT 9.1.  General. 9.1.1.  All specialty/surgical care and Right of First Refusal (ROFR) referrals/consults will be managed  IAW current  AFMS Referral  Management  Business Rules (BRs), (see attachment two),  and  Assistant  Secretary  of  Defense  for  Health  Affairs  (ASD  (HA))  referral management (RM) guidance. 9.1.2.  The  TOPA  Flight  Commander  is  responsible  for  executing  the  referral  management (RM) process and the Referral Management Center (RMC); GPMs must be familiar with the referral process. (T-3) 9.1.3.  The MTF’s RMC is accountable for managing and tracking referrals generated by the MTF and ROFR referrals until closure.  The referral is considered closed when: the referral is cancelled/denied; the patient has cancelled/not used the referral; or the referring provider has received the Clear and Legible Report (CLR). (T-1) 9.1.4.  Carepoint  Referral  Management  Suite  (RMS)  is  the  only  interim  electronic  RM application approved by the Military Health System for use by the MTF to transmit and track all  referrals  until  the  MHS  GENESIS  Electronic  Health  Record  (EHR)  is  deployed  at  the MTF. (T-0) 9.1.5.  The MTF Executive staff or designee (not a workgroup) is the approval authority for the MTF’s Capability and Capacity report (T-1).  The MTF’s Capability and ROFR reports should  be  as  unrestrictive  as  possible  to  retain/recapture  the  maximum  number  of  specialty care  referrals  to  sustain  clinical  currency  and  minimize  purchased  care  costs.  These  reports should  be  updated  as  needed  for  accuracy.  (T-3)  All  referral  requests  will  be  routed  to  the RMC  or  multiservice  market  referral  center  for  administrative  review,  appointing  to  the MTF, and processing to  the Managed Care Support  Contractor (MCSC). Exceptions to  this process  shall  be  approved  by  the  Executive  Staff  or  designee  in  writing.  MTF  specialty clinics  exempted  by  the  Executive  Staff  are  responsible  for  referral  review,  booking,  & tracking of those referrals.  (T-3) 9.1.6.  The MTF Executive Staff will provide appointment booking keys to trained, front line support staff (e.g. in primary care, central appointing, RMC, etc.) in order to support patient-centered booking into specialty clinics before the patient leaves the MTF. (T-3) 9.1.7.  Clinic,  RMC  and  appointing  personnel  will  use  the  CHCS  Appointment  Order Processing function to book initial MTF specialty appointments. (T-1). This CHCS function links the appointment to the referral and ensures correct tracking through CHCS and RMS. 9.1.8.  The  MTF  Executive  Staff  will  empower  appointing  agents  to  book  the  patient’s specialty appointment anytime the referral has an “Appoint to MTF” review.  If the referral lacks  a  review  disposition  when  the  patient  calls,  then  the  appointment  center  agent  shall provide the patient a “warm hand-off” to the RMC or specialty clinic to immediately review the referral and appoint or defer it. If “clinic-book only” appointments are authorized, and a patient  calls  the  central  appointment  center  for  a  “clinic  book  only”  appointment,  then  the AFI44-176  8 SEPTEMBER 2017 29 appointing agent shall provide a “warm hand-off” directly to the specialty clinic to assist the patient. (T-0) 9.1.9.  The  MTF  Executive  Staff  will  ensure  patients  are  offered  three  different  specialty appointment times within the 28 calendar day access to care standard. When the MTF cannot offer three different specialty appointment times within the access standard, patients may be offered MTF appointments outside the standard if they choose to waive their ATC standard.  If the patient does not waive their ATC standard, the patient’s referral will be deferred to the purchased care. (T-0) 9.1.10.  The  MTF  Executive  Staff  will  ensure  specialty  clinic  and  RMC  personnel  return patient messages within one business day of message receipt. One business day includes the message received date plus the end of the next business day. (T-0) 9.1.11.  The  MTF  Executive  Staff  will  ensure  the  MTF’s  consult/referral  auto-closure function in CHCS is turned off. (T-0) 9.2.  Referring Provider Responsibilities. 9.2.1.  The referring provider will: 9.2.2.  Promptly enter all initial specialty referrals into the EHR, preferably before the patient leaves the encounter or immediately after the virtual visit. (T-1) 9.2.3.  Review referral results within three business days of notification that the results have been received. (T-1) 9.2.4.  Communicate  to  the  patient  within  one  business  day  when  a  referral  is  denied  or cancelled,  and  whether  or  not  a  new  referral  will  be  ordered.    This  communication  may  be delegated to the clinical team. (T-3) 9.3.  Specialist Responsibilities. 9.3.1.  The  specialist  will  communicate  to  the  referring  provider  the  reasons  for  a  referral cancellation  or  if  more  information  is  needed  on  the  referral.    This  communication  may  be delegated to the clinical team. (T-3) 9.4.  Referral Management Center (RMC) Responsibilities. 9.4.1.  The RMC will: 9.4.1.1.  Ensure all initial specialty care referrals are either accepted for appointing to the direct care system or deferred to the network within one business day from the order date.  One business day includes the order date plus the end of the next business day. (T-0) 9.4.1.1.1.  For  referrals  requiring  specialty  clinic  review,  if  the  specialty  clinic  does not review the referral within one business day, the RMC will book the patient to the specialty clinic based on the MTF’s capability/capacity report or defer the patient to the network. (T-0) 9.4.1.2.  Defer  TRICARE  eligible  patient  referrals  to  the  network  regardless  of beneficiary category or specialty service line if the patient cannot be booked to the MTF specialty clinic within the appropriate ATC standard as indicated by the referral priority and the patient does not waive the ATC standard. (T-0) 30 AFI44-176  8 SEPTEMBER 2017 9.4.1.3.  Notify  patients  that  their  referral  was  deferred  to  the  network  or  accepted  for appointing to the MTF within one business day from the time the review decision (e.g., Appoint to MTF or Defer to Network) was entered into the EHR. (T-0) 9.4.1.3.1.  This communication can occur before the patient leaves the MTF, by live phone  call  or  secure  messaging  after  the  patient  leaves  the  MTF,  or  through automated  methods  (e.g.  Audio-Communicator,  etc.).    The  communication  will inform the patient about how to make the direct care appointment, how to cancel the referral, and/or when to expect the network authorization letter or e-mail. (T-0) 9.4.1.4.  Notify the referring provider of all routine priority referrals not used or activated by their patients IAW local MTF policy, but no less than monthly. (T-1) AFI44-176  8 SEPTEMBER 2017 31 Chapter 10 AIR RESERVE COMPONENT (ARC) ACCESS TO CARE 10.1.  Introduction. 10.1.1.  The  following  DoD  and  Air  Force  publications  provide  guidance  for  determining ARC  eligibility:  AFI  41-210,  TRICARE  Operations  and  Patient  Administration  Functions; AFI  36-2910,  Line  of  Duty  (LOD)  Determination,  Medical  Continuation  (MEDCON),  and Incapacitation  (INCAP)  Pay;  AFI  44-170  Preventive  Health  Assessment;  DoDI  1332.18, Disability  Evaluation  System  (DES),  and  the  Air  Force  Reserve  Command  (AFRC)  PHA Guide. In addition, Title 10 USC Section 1074 and Title 37 United States Code, Section 204 as well as AFRC/SG and Air National Guard (ANG)/SG can be used for references. 10.1.2.  ARC members who incur or aggravate an injury, illness or disease in the line of duty while performing active  duty,  active duty  for training or inactive duty for training or  while traveling  directly  to  or  from  such  duty,  shall  be  provided  the  medical  or  dental  care appropriate for the condition until the member is found returned to duty, or the injury, illness or  disease  cannot  be  materially  improved  by  further  hospitalization  or  treatment  and  the member  has  been  separated  as  a  result  of  a  Disability  Evaluation  System  (DES) determination. To enter into the DES for a duty-related determination, the member must have received  an  In  Line  of  Duty  (ILOD)  determination  for  his/her  potentially  unfitting condition(s). (T-0) 10.2.  ARC Health Care Benefits for Air Force Required Evaluations. 10.2.1.  ARC  members  assigned  to  ARC  Units  with  sufficient  medical  assets  will  receive their  required  evaluations  (e.g.,  Periodic  Health  Assessment  (PHA),  annual  Dental  exam, etc.)  from  their  respective  servicing  Reserve  Medical  Unit  or  Guard  Medical  Unit  or  other approved source. (T-2) 10.2.2.  AFRC  members  attached  to  Regular  Air  Force  (RegAF)  units  or  assigned  to  ARC Units  without  a  servicing  AFRC  Medical  Unit  will  receive  their  required  AFRC  PHA evaluations from a RegAF MTF or other approved source. (T-2) 10.2.3.  Many  ARC  members  travel  considerable  distances  from  their  home  to  their  unit  of assignment or have limited time to complete these appointments on duty days. When an ARC member  is  seen  in  the  MTF,  clinic/ancillary  services  personnel  must  complete  all  physical and  ancillary  services  on  the  same  day  as  the  provider  appointment.  (T-3)  This  does  not include the completion of the paperwork, only the actual testing and evaluation. 10.2.4.  ARC members residing outside the MTF catchment area or more than 40 miles from their units’ servicing MTF may also obtain these evaluations from the nearest MTF. 10.2.5.  ARC  members  not  on  orders  normally  show  as  ineligible  in  DEERS  (Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System); however, this does not preclude the booking of an appointment  for  the  ARC  member  by  appointing  agents.  Should  further  verification  of eligibility  be  required,  appointing  agents  should  contact  the  ARC  member’s  unit administrator/medical representative or consult the MTF access manager. 32 AFI44-176  8 SEPTEMBER 2017 10.2.6.  ARC members are not required to be in “military status” to schedule an appointment; however, they must be in a military status  at  the time of  the examination and must provide documentation to  clinic staff that they are in  a military status.   Military status  is  defined as active or inactive duty status. ARC members with an approved LOD do not need to be in a military status for examination or treatment. (T-2) 10.2.7.  ARC  members  will  have  the  same  level  of  access  for  these  required  evaluations  as RegAF members. (T-0) 10.3.  ARC Access to Care for Line of Duty (LOD) Determinations. 10.3.1.  Access  to  care  is  allowed  only  for  the  condition  identified  for  LOD  determination, during  the  determination  of  the  LOD.    In  accordance  with  AFI  36-2910,  Line  of  Duty Determination,  Medical  Continuation  and  Incapacitation  Pay,  ARC  member  must  provide documentation  of  LOD(s)  that  are  in  process  or  have  been  determined  LOD  in  order  to receive follow-up care (e.g., AF Form 348). (T-3) 10.3.2.  Eligibility  for  continued  medical/dental  care  will  be  determined  by  line  of  duty findings as specified in  AFI 36-2910. According to  AFI 41-210, entitlement exists only  for the medical condition determined to be In the Line of Duty (ILOD). An AF Form 348 (-R), or  DD  Form  261,  Report  of  Investigation  Line  of  Duty  and  Misconduct  Status,  or  Interim LOD with all signature blocks complete, is needed to establish eligibility. The LOD is valid for care only until the service member is  found fit and returned to duty or separated by the Disability Evaluation System (DES) for the documented medical condition. 10.3.2.1.  ARC members will have the same level  of access  to  care as RegAF members for treatment of those conditions identified in a positive finding for ILOD determination. (T-0) 10.3.3.  ARC members will not be eligible for care when the determination is Not in Line of Duty (NILOD). (T-0) Care received at this point is at the member’s expense. 10.3.4.  According  to  AFI  36-2910,  paragraph  2.3.3.,  the  immediate  commander  may  issue an Interim LOD determination to establish initial care and treatment pending the final LOD determination.  The  Interim  LOD  determination  is  comprised  of  the  completed  medical portion  of  AF  Form  348,  in  accordance  with  guidance  listed  in  AFI  36-2910,  paragraph 2.3.3.3. 10.4.  ARC  Referrals.  ARC  members  who  require  follow-up  care  not  in  the  area  where  the initial  treatment  was  rendered  are  referred  to  the  closest  MTF  near  their  home.  Appropriate medical  authority  from  the  referring  MTF  contacts  the  appropriate  medical  authority  at  the receiving  MTF  to  ensure  care  is  delivered.  The  referring  MTF  will  notify  the  member’s supporting ARC medical unit of the referral action for tracking purposes. (T-1) 10.4.1.  Refer ARC members who are serving under Title 10 Contingency, Title 10, or Title 32 orders who are identified with potential duty-related illness or injury in an urgent manner (72 hour consult), to include maximum utilization of both RegAF and off-base referral sites. This practice ensures timely identification and access to entitled healthcare prior to the end of mobilization  or  contingency  orders  and  without a  break  in  service  that  can  result  in  loss  of medical benefits. AFI44-176  8 SEPTEMBER 2017 33 10.4.2.  Any  care  referred  outside  the  MTF  is  only  paid  for  if  the  LOD  process  has  been initiated  or  completed.  In  addition,  the  referral  must  be  coordinated  with  the  Reserve  and Service  Member  Support  Office  Great  Lakes  (R&SMSO-GL)  (formerly  MMSO)  by  MTF staff.  (T-1)  Coordination  with  the  R&SMSO-GL  ensures  services  are  rendered  without  a denial of claim. 34 AFI44-176  8 SEPTEMBER 2017 Chapter 11 SPECIALTY CARE 11.1.  Overview. 11.1.1.  Specialty clinics include but are not limited to: Optometry, Mental Health, Physical Therapy, Women’s Health, Surgery, Internal Medicine and Pediatric Specialties, etc. 11.2.  Schedule Planning and Forecasting. 11.2.1.  Unless otherwise noted in this chapter, specialty care clinics will maintain a rolling 180-day  calendar  (e.g.,  historical  patient  utilization  patterns,  leave,  TDY,  base  exercises, down  days,  etc.)  to  ensure  adequate  provider  and  clinic  staff  availability  to  meet  patient demand within access standards. (T-0) 11.2.2.  The AMT will analyze patient demand utilizing the measures listed in para 2.2.4. (T-2)  Effective management  of appointments will maximize patient  access  to  MTF and avoid purchasing private sector medical care. 11.3.  Schedule Implementation and Management. 11.3.1.  Clinic  leadership  will  ensure  that  schedules  are  released  to  allow,  at  a  minimum,  a continuous/rolling  180-calendar  day  supply  of  available  appointments  for  booking,  unless otherwise noted in this chapter. (T-0) 11.3.2.  Clinic  leadership  will  have  written  processes  for  appointment  schedule  change requests with the goal of minimizing frequent/repeated changes to opened schedules, changes causing facility cancellations, and rescheduling of patients. (T-3) Appointments will be set up to auto-reconfigure as applicable, IAW with Chapter 3, Schedule Management, of this AFI. 11.3.3.  In  coordination  with  the  clinic,  unbooked  FTR  appointments  will  be  converted  or auto  reconfigured  to  SPEC  no  later  than  (NLT)  7  days  prior  to  the  scheduled  appointment time. (T-1) 11.3.4.  Frozen appointments  will be released/deleted NLT 72 hours prior to  the clinic day. Appointments will be set up to auto-reconfigure. (T-1) 11.3.5.  GPM  will  provide  a  daily  review  of  the  next  clinic  day’s  appointment  availability and mix to ensure schedules meet patient demand and are adjusted as needed. (T-2) 11.4.  Analysis. 11.4.1.  Unfilled  appointments  will  be  analyzed  to  determine  the  root  causes:  for  example, type of appointment; time appointment offered; in contrast to purchase care leakage for the same services; detail codes restrictions, etc. (T-2) 11.4.2.  Published  schedules  will  be  analyzed  to  determine  the  effectiveness  relative  to  the quantity  of  appointments,  over/under  supply,  seasonality  impacts,  cancellations,  no-shows, schedule changes, etc. (T-2) 11.4.3.  The GPM and RMC will develop a business case analysis to determine effectiveness of retaining referred care. (T-2) 11.5.  Mental Health ATC Management. AFI44-176  8 SEPTEMBER 2017 35 11.5.1.  The  GPM  will  provide  at  least  a  monthly  consultation  on  the  management  of templates and schedules and the measurement of the Mental Health clinic’s performance in meeting  ATC  standards  to  the  leadership  and  templating/scheduling  staff  of  the  Mental Health clinic. (T-3) 11.5.2.  The GPM will ensure overall management of Mental Health access will be IAW AFI 44-172,  Mental  Health,  to  include  appointment  cancellation  guidance  for  Mental  Health patients. (T-0) 11.5.3.  MTFs will establish processes to ensure that requests for emergent mental healthcare are provided on an immediate basis as dictated by the threat. (T-0) 11.5.4.  Urgent  mental  healthcare  is  provided  within  24  hours  or  less.  (T-0)  Urgent  mental healthcare  includes  manifest  behavior  and/or  cut-off  scores  on  the  Patient  Health Questionnaire-9  (PHQ-9).  Clinics  can  book  these  patients  into  24HR  appointments  or  walk them  in.  Mental  Health  clinics  should  utilize  CHCS  as  much  as  possible  for  creating appointments. 11.5.5.  Mental  Health  Clinic  Appointment  Types.  Clinics  will  use  appointment  types  IAW the definitions of Chapter 5. Only the following standard appointment types are permitted to be used:  (T-1) 11.5.5.1.  Clinics will use 24HR slots to book urgent mental healthcare requests within 24 hours, to include walk-in appointments that need to be seen the same day. 11.5.5.2.  Clinics will use SPEC  slots to  book any  initial  mental  health patients  referred by  another  provider  or  clinic,  not  to  exceed  28  days.  All  new  appointments  referred  by the BHOP should be SPECS. 11.5.5.3.  Clinics  will  use  FTR  slots  to  book  follow-up  appointments  for  additional mental  healthcare/course  of  therapy.    Clinics  will  book  these  appointments  within  the time frame requested by the mental health provider. 11.5.5.4.  Clinics will use GRP slots for patients who require group therapies, counseling, or teaching sessions where a mental health provider will perform the service in  a group setting. The detail code fields can be used to provide further information about the care to be provided in the group appointment, (e.g., STRESS for a Stress Management Class). A group  appointment  should  be  scheduled  per  self-referral  of  the  patient,  the  clinic's  or referring provider's policy or designation. 11.5.5.4.1.  Automated  Neuropsychological  Assessment  Metrics  (ANAM)  GRP appointment  slots  can  also  be  used  for  ANAM  assessments  for  1  to  50  personnel being scheduled during the same time slot. To clarify the care being provided in this group  appointment,  it  is  recommended  that  two  additional  detail  codes  be  used  in combination with  the GRP standard appointment  type.  This  alerts  appointing agents to  book  the  proper  individuals  into  these  slots.  This  coding  also  provides  a mechanism  to  monitor  the  number  of  ANAM  assessments  being  performed.    They are: 11.5.5.4.1.1.  For Pre-deployment Assessments:  Use MH detail code (for Mental Health) combined with the RPRE detail code (for Readiness Pre-Deployment). 11.5.5.4.1.2.  For  Post-deployment  Assessments:    Use  the  MH  detail  combined 36 AFI44-176  8 SEPTEMBER 2017 with the RPD (Readiness Post-deployment) detail code. 11.5.5.5.  Clinics  will  use  ROUTINE  slots  to  book  new  self-referrals  and  not  just  for those patients discharged from an inpatient facility. 11.5.6.  Behavioral  Health  Optimization  Program  (BHOP)  Appointing.    Military  Treatment Facilities should attempt to utilize BHOP services as entry point for Mental Health services. 11.5.6.1.  Appointment types for BHOP: Family Health Clinic embedded service BHOP clinics are permitted to use three standard appointment types: 11.5.6.1.1.  Clinics will use 24HR slots to book urgent behavioral healthcare requests within 24 hours, to include walk-in appointments that need to be seen the same day. (T-1) 11.5.6.1.2.  Clinics  will  use  the  FTR  appointment  type  for  patients  requesting  non-urgent  follow  up  services,  beyond  24  hours  only.  Follow-up  appointments  will  be booked within the time frame requested by the BHOP provider. (T-1) 11.5.6.1.3.  Clinics  will  use  the  GRP  appointment  type  for  patients  who  require therapy, counseling, or teaching sessions where a provider performs the service in a group setting. (T-1) 11.5.6.1.4.  Clinics will use the SPEC appointment type for all new appointments. (T-1) 11.5.6.2.  WALK-IN visits are also allowed and clinics will use when a patient urgently needs to be seen and there is no appointment available. (T-1) 11.5.7.  Mental Health should have a no-show rate of no more than five (5) percent for new SPEC appointments and no more than ten percent for all other appointment types. (T-1) 11.6.  Physical Therapy (PT) Direct Access Management. 11.6.1.  Appointment  Types  Used  in  PT  Templates  and  Schedules.  Appointment  types  will be used as outlined below: (T-3) 11.6.1.1.  Clinics  will  only  use  24HR  slots  to  schedule  direct  access  (i.e.,  no  referral needed) evaluations and for acute conditions that should be seen within 24 hours. 11.6.1.2.  Clinics  will  use  SPEC  slots to  schedule/book  any  Routine  priority referral/consult  requests  for  initial  physical  therapy  care  evaluations  by  a  physical therapist (officer or civilian/contract  equivalent)  within the time frame requested by the referring provider or not to exceed 28 days. (T-3) 11.6.1.3.  Clinics  will  use  FTR  slots  to  schedule/book  appointments  to  the  physical therapist  for  the  purpose  of  reevaluation  or  treatment.  Clinics  will  book  these appointments within the time frame requested by the physical therapist. (T-3) 11.6.1.4.  Clinics  will  use  PROC  slots  to  schedule  PT  care  appointments  to  enlisted, civilian,  or  contract  PT  technicians  or  equivalent  providers  as  approved/directed  by  the physical  therapist.  The  majority  of  appointments  scheduled  for  PT  technicians  will  use the PROC appointment type.  If multiple patients  are to  be seen at  the same time by the PT Technician in a group setting for PT care/courses of therapy, the PROC appointment AFI44-176  8 SEPTEMBER 2017 37 type with multiple appointment slots during the same time will be used. Clinics will book all PROC appointments within 28 days to meet the Specialty Care ATC standard. (T-3) 11.6.1.5.  Clinics  will  use  GRP  slots  for  patients  who  require  group  teaching/education classes/sessions by any physical therapist or PT technician. (T-3) 11.6.2.  Guidance if Physical Therapist and PT Technician treat patient during same visit: 11.6.2.1.  If both the physical therapist and the PT technician see a patient during a visit, the  appointment  type  used  will  default  to  the  one  that  was  originally  chosen  when booking  the  appointment.  For  example,  if  a  PROC  appointment  is  booked  for  the  PT tech, but during the visit the physical therapist sees the patient, then the appointment type for the visit remains PROC. 11.6.3.  Physical  Therapy  should  have  a  no-show  rate  of  no  more  than  five  (5)  percent  for new SPEC appointments and no more than ten percent for all other appointment types. (T-3) 11.7.  Audiology/Hearing Conservation  ATC Management. 11.7.1.  Audiology/Hearing  Conservation  scheduling  must  adhere  to  all  of  the  operational definitions. (T-3) 11.7.2.

Numbered Decision Points. No. Decision Point Description Tier At a minimum, the Referral Management Center (RMC) staff will: Read and refer to AFI 44-176, RM guidance/policies, other AFIs impacting referrals; TRICARE Operations Manual (TOM) chapters related to  referrals; TRICARE Policy Manual (TPM) on the TRICARE benefit.    RMC  Staff Training Complete Referral Management Suite (RMS) and  Electronic Health Record (EHR) training (CHCS or MHS GENESIS); Managed Care Support Contractor (MCSC) website/tools training; other MTF training. T-2 The RMC should be located within the MTF (exception: Enhanced Multi-Service  Markets (eMSM)) and in close proximity to the primary care clinics to  promote patient convenience and staff communication. The RMC  location will be configured to accommodate queues and patient privacy.    Locate RMC w/Patient In Mind Educate MTF Providers & Clinical Staff The MTF will train providers/clinical staff during orientation/in-processing and on a recurring basis as needed on the following:  roles and  responsibilities for ordering referrals/consult; specialty capability within the MTF/ eMSM; non-covered benefits to avoid writing referrals that will be  denied; use of network specialists; and avoidance of MTF directed referrals and  use of non-network specialists without written clinical justification.   Definition of a consult:  a request for an opinion on the best course of  treatment for a patient; the referring provider continues care for patient  based on the advice of the consulted provider.  Example:  Evaluate Only Consult and Referral Definitions and Priority  Types Definition of a referral:  a request to evaluate and treat and assume care for the patient for the  condition.  The terms referrals and consults are used interchangeably in  this document.  Example: Evaluate and Treat Other than Routine Priority Specialty Care Referrals For other than routine priority referrals, the provider/clinical team will contact the specialist directly and arrange an appointment (hand-off communications).  The accepting provider’s name, appointment date, phone number (if T-3 T-3 T-1 1. 2. 3. 4. 4.1. AFI44-176  8 SEPTEMBER 2017 No. Decision Point 4.2.  4.3. Routine Priority Referrals 4.4. Urgent Primary Care Referrals 4.5. Urgent Primary Care Pilot 47 Tier T-1 Description available) and location/facility will be annotated within the referral. Urgent Care is defined in the TOM as “medically necessary treatment that is required for illness or injury that would not result in further disability or death if not treated immediately. The illness or injury does require professional attention, and should be treated within 24 hours to avoid development of a situation in which further complications could result if treatment is not received.”   For urgent priority referrals, the provider/clinical team will contact the specialist directly and arrange for an urgent specialty care appointment (hand-off communication).  Alternatively, the MTF’s MCSC can assign a specialist. The RMC will process the referral immediately and transmit it to the MCSC.  The RMC/clinical team will ensure the patient clearly understands when and where his/her urgent priority referral appointment will occur per the MCSC authorization, before leaving the MTF.  The DoD access to care (ATC) standard for routine referrals is 28 days  from date the referral was written.  See BR 10, “Appoint Referral to MTF  Specialty Clinic”, for waiving ATC standards.  The MTF will manage and track consults for urgent primary care.  Urgent primary care consults  requested during or after duty hours will be entered into the EHR  NLT the next duty day. With documented training and written  algorithms, other staff members (e.g., appointing agents, etc.) may enter consults for urgent primary care into the EHR.  The RMC will transmit the consult to the  MCSC and obtain the urgent primary care consult results.   T-1 For the allowed number of urgent primary care visits without a referral for eligible beneficiary categories per TRICARE policy, refer to TOM, Chapter 18, Section 19, Pilot Program On Urgent Care For TRICARE Prime/TPR Beneficiaries. Urgent care (UC) sought under this program is considered a “self-referral” episode of care; there is no requirement to chase the UC report. However, MTFs should encourage Urgent Care Clinics (UCCs) to send results to the MTF. UCC Reports to be obtained by the MTF though means such as the NAL.    48 AFI44-176  8 SEPTEMBER 2017 No. Decision Point Description Tier Credentialed providers will order consults in the EHR before the  end of the patient encounter so the patient can go to the RMC for appointing,   guidance/counseling before he/she leaves the MTF. At a minimum, providers should include on the  referral: a provisional diagnosis; reason for referral to include treatments  attempted and outcome(s); care or service requested; and whether the  specialist is to evaluate or evaluate and treat the patient.  The RMC staff  will not enter new, renewal, or retroactive referrals/consults (excludes ROFRs). For requests by network specialists for additional visits, per TOM Chapter 8, Section 5, “For services beyond the initial authorization, the MCSC shall use its best practices in determining the extent of additional service to authorize. The MCSC shall not request a referral from the MTF…” This applies for non-ADSM patients. ADSM patients require MTF approval and referral renewal. The MTF will not direct referrals to specific network or non-network providers (Provider by Name) without written clinical justification.  The MTF will not direct referrals to providers greater than 100 miles from the MTF (Directed Referrals) and coordination with the TRO (See TOM, Chapter 8, Section 5). Patients requesting specific non-network providers may exercise their point of service option or contact the MCSC. If a referral is ordered for a non-covered benefit, the MTF will submit to the MCSC the Defense Health Agency (DHA) waiver approval with the referral.  If the waiver approval is not included when the referral is sent,  the MCSC will deny the referral. Resources: The MCSC will use the No Government Pay List (NGPL) and TRICARE Policy for included/excluded services to administer the TRICARE benefit for ADSMs (See TOM, Chapter 17, Section 3, Contractor Responsibilities, for complete policy http://manuals.tricare.osd.mil/). The NGPL is available on the www.health.mil site. T-1 T-1 T-0 T-0 Waiver forms, DHA policy, and AF waiver process can be downloaded from the AFMS  Knowledge Exchange. Contact the AFMOA/SGAT region POC for questions. In general, the requesting provider and the MTF SGH will initiate the waiver process  and complete required documents.

If the AF Consultant does not support the waiver, do not forward to AFMOA SGAT. If the AF Consultant approves the waiver, forward package to the respective AFMOA SGAT Regional Rep. Once the waiver is approved by DHA, the RMC will fax the  approved waiver with the referral to the MCSC. The MTF will route all specialty care referrals through the EHR to the  RMC or eMSM RMC for administrative review, appointing to the MTF,  and processing. The Executive Staff will approve in writing exceptions to this routing. MTF specialty clinics (exempted by the Executive Staff) that perform their own reviews will be responsible for referral review, booking, and tracking of referrals.   MTFs will configure the RMC as a “Clinic” location Hospital Location file, use ELAA MEPRS code and populate the “Clinic  Specialty” field with all clinic specialties available in the MTF and  purchased care.  6.2. CHCS Ancillary Procedures The MTF will ensure that each Ancillary Procedure contains the name of the  specialty in the “Clinic Specialty” field and the RMC in the “Consulting  Clinic” field.  Applies only for specialty care referrals as defined in BR 4.  For orders or requests for care that use the EHR as means to track orders performed in the purchased care and do not require a MCSC authorization (e.g, mammograms for Non-ADSMs, case management, laboratory requests, etc.), the MTF will route the “referral” to the appropriate MTF accountable tracking owner.  See BR 13.5 Referring providers/clinical teams will instruct patients with referrals to go to the  RMC prior to leaving the MTF (Exception: eMSM RMCs located at a  distance from the referring MTF). The MTF should provide patients a brochure which explains, at a minimum, the RM process, contact information of MCSC for  authorization questions, and RMC’s contact information for questions. 6.3. Orders Entered as “Referrals” 7. Send Patients  to the RMC 49 Tier T-1 T-1 T-1 T-1 T-3 RMC staff will confirm patient’s TRICARE eligibility and contact  information (in CHCS, ensure preferred phone number is entered in the “home phone number” field); appoint the patient’s MTF specialty  appointment prior to leaving the MTF or explain how they will be notified  of their appointment; and explain the purchased care referral process. Refer the patient to the MCSC or Beneficiary Counseling and  T-3 8. Customer Service 50 AFI44-176  8 SEPTEMBER 2017 No. Decision Point Description Assistance  Coordinator for health plan coverage information as needed.   Tier The RMC will review all specialty care referrals (except self-referrals and “referrals” for  administrative tracking) within one business day from the date the referral was ordered. One business day includes the order date plus the entire following day, excluding weekends and holidays. The review process includes checking the MTF’s capability/capacity report and appointing guidelines to determine if the referral can be appointed to the MTF. The RMC staff should consult with subspecialty clinics or send the referral to the specialist for review as  needed. If the MTF has no capability/capacity for the requested specialty, the RMC will defer the referral to the purchased care. The RMC will ensure the referral includes the required data elements as defined in TOM Chapter 8 Section 5.   If the referral requires a review by the specialty clinic, the specialty clinic will review the referral within one business day from the date the referral was ordered. One business day includes the order date plus the entire following day, excluding weekends and holidays. If the specialty clinic does not review the referral within one BD, the RMC will book the patient to the specialty clinic based on the MTF’s capability/capacity report and appointing guidelines or defer the patient to the network.   T-0 T-1 The RMC may complete missing information or over-ride incorrect fields in RMS or MHS GENESIS, if permitted; otherwise, the RMC should return the referral to the ordering provider for correction and/or completion.  To the greatest extent possible, the MTF will book patients to the MTF’s specialty care clinic before the patient leaves the MTF.   T-0 Specialty clinics will provide the RMC and eMSM RMC with current appointing guidelines. The appointing guidelines should be as unrestrictive as possible to retain/recapture the maximum number of specialty care referrals within the MTF. T-3 9. Referral  Review 9.1.

If the MTF cannot meet the ATC standard, the appointing staff should ask patients if they would like to waive their ATC standard and opt for a later appointment. MTFs cannot mandate patients to waive their ATC standard. If the patient does not waive his/her ATC standard, then the MTF will defer the patient to  purchased care. The MTF will book the initial MTF specialty appointment in CHCS using the Appointment Order Processing (AOP) function in order to link the appointment with the referral and ensure correct tracking through CHCS/RMS. Follow MHS GENESIS procedures to appoint patients. The MTF will notify patients of their MTF referral appointment before they leave the MTF or within one business day from the date the review decision to appoint the referral to the MTF was made. The notification can be done by live phone call, secure messaging, or through automated methods (e.g. Audio-Communicator, etc.). The notification will be repeated until the appointment is booked, the patient cancels the referral, or the message has been delivered three times on separate days.  MTFs that refer patients to other MTFs should follow the following processes:  a.  If the referring MTF (e.g., Bolling AFB) is on the same CHCS host as the  consulting MTF (e.g., Andrews AFB), the referring MTF (Bolling) should select the consulting clinic (e.g., Andrews RMC) and enter a review status  of “Refer to Subspecialty” (code 14). b.  If the referring MTF (e.g., Laughlin AFB) is not on the 51 Tier T-0 T-0 T-0 same CHCS host  as the consulting MTF (e.g., SAMMC Consult & Appointing Office  (CAMO)), the referring MTF (Laughlin) should enter a review status of  “Defer to Network” (code #10) and in the first line of the “Review  Comment” field will type “To MTF/” plus the DMIS of the consulting  MTF, e.g. TO MTF/0066. Complete the Clinic specialty field, indicating  the specialty requested. Transmit the referral to the consulting MTF. The consulting MTF’s RMC (e.g., CAMO) should enter the referral in CHCS/AHLTA as a consult and in the first line of the  Referrals to Another MTF (CHCS) 11. 52 AFI44-176  8 SEPTEMBER 2017 No. Decision Point Description Tier Review Comment  field will type “From MTF/” plus the DMIS of the referring MTF, e.g.,  FROM MTF/0114. Follow MHS GENESIS procedures. The MTF Executive Staff will approve the MTF’s Capability and Capacity report. The MTF’s Capability and Capacity report should be as unrestrictive as  possible to retain/recapture the maximum number of specialty care referrals to sustain clinical currency and minimize purchased care costs.  The MTF will ensure the report is current and provided to the RMC, MCSC, and eMSM (if applicable).   When there is no specialty care available in the MTF, the RMC or eMSM will defer and transmit the referral to the MCSC. The RMC will assist patients with specialty care referrals not requiring MCSC authorization and advise them of their  options based on their TRICARE health plan and eligibility.  The MTF will notify patients of their defer to network referral  before they leave the MTF or within one business day from the date the review decision to send the referral to the purchased care was made. The notification can be done by live phone call, secure messaging, or through automated methods (e.g. Audio-Communicator, etc.). Repeat the call 14 calendar days after the referral’s order date to remind the patient to make an appointment with the civilian provider indicated in the authorization letter.   The RMC will document at least one of the below codes in the referral’s CHCS Review Comment field using the hard brackets [xx]. Use of at least one code is mandatory. Multiple codes  may be used; however, each code must be in its own bracket.  MTFs should utilize the RMS “Referral Summary” or “Referral Trends” reports to analyze reasons referrals were sent  to the purchased care. MTFs on MHS GENESIS will follow MHS GENESIS processes.

Screening The RMC will process and track laboratory and radiologic orders  and Durable Medical Equipment (DME) referrals that require MCSC authorizations. DME invoices  are considered a “clear and legible report (CLR).”  T-1 If the MTF enters  referrals for ancillary services not requiring MCSC authorizations for electronic tracking purposes, the  MTF will designate the appropriate department (e.g., radiology, laboratory, medical management, etc.) to track these “referrals.” This  function is not within the scope of the central RM contract. DME that do not require authorization is optional.    Preventive care testing does not require TRICARE authorization;  therefore, the RMC will not process, manage, or track orders/referrals for screening exams. The RMC will not enter cancer  screenings (breast, cervical and colorectal cancer screenings), HgbA1c  results, and LDL HEDIS results in the TSWF MHSPHP AIM form.  This  function is not within the scope of the central RM contract. T-1 T-1 T-1  13.7. Patient Travel For authorized care outside of the 100 mile MTF-radius, the TOPA travel  section will assist patients with travel arrangements (Refer to AFI 41-210). Right of First Refusal Referrals (ROFRs) A ROFR is a referral from a beneficiary enrolled to a network civilian  PCM sent to the MTF by the MCSC for appointing consideration. MTFs should ensure the  fullest extent of ROFR acceptance to sustain clinical currency.  14. 54 AFI44-176  8 SEPTEMBER 2017 No. Decision Point Description Tier The MTF will accept/decline urgent priority ROFRs received within 90  minutes of receipt or as updated in TOM 8.5. The MTF will  accept/decline routine priority ROFRs received within two business day of  receipt or as updated in TOM 8.5. Failure to respond to ROFR requests  within the prescribed time is an implied MTF declination and the MCSC will send the patient to the network.  If the ROFR is accepted, the RMC will enter the ROFR into the EHR as a consult. If the ROFR is entered in CHCS Referral Booking, convert the referral to a consult in CHCS in order to track results. In both cases, use the CHCS downtown provider or generic downtown provider as the referring provider. Follow MHS GENESIS processes for entering referrals.  T-0 T-0 14.1. Accept or Decline ROFRs 14.2. Enter ROFRs in the EHR 14.3.  Appoint ROFRs The RMC or specialty clinic will contact the patients and schedule their MTF specialty care appointments. See BR 10.    T-0 Send ROFR Referral Reports to Civilian PCM The RMC will forward the specialty care report via a HIPAA-compliant method to the referring civilian PCM within 10-business days of the patient’s kept appointment. T-0 14.4. Referrals for Certain Patient Categories and Situations 15. 15.1. ADSM on Medical Hold 15.2. ADSMs on Terminal  Leave The MTF shall have processes to address the below patient situations: T-1 Health Affairs policy 03-026, requires MTFs to ensure specialty care services are  available for ADSMs on “medical hold” within two weeks of identifying  the need for an appointment. Consult AFI 41-210, TRICARE Operations and Patient Administration Functions, for specific medical hold requirements. MTFs should collaborate with their MCSCs  to ensure that ADSMs receive their referral authorizations and appointments expeditiously. Referring MTF providers will specify in the  body of the referral when the ADSM should be seen (e.g., 72 hours, 7  days, 14 days, etc.) rather than using the default 28-day ATC standard for  “Routine” priority referrals. During the terminal leave period, an ADSM in need of urgent private sector care must receive a referral and authorization from his or her MTF Primary Care Manager (PCM) located at the ADSM’s final duty station. Routine private sector medical care is authorized only as part of the ADSM’s active healthcare needs and should be pre-planned T-0 T-0 AFI44-176  8 SEPTEMBER 2017 No. Decision Point Description and pre-authorized collaboratively by ADSM with his or her PCM. ADSMs on terminal leave may receive routine or urgent care at a VA medical facility. If an ADSM intends, while in terminal leave status, to reside outside of the Prime Service Area of the MTF where the ADSM is enrolled, utilizing procedures specified in TOM Chapter 17, Section 1, the MTF shall issue to the MCSC a single preauthorization for the ADSM to obtain from VA any necessary routine or urgent outpatient medical care. The period covered by this preauthorization shall be the entire anticipated span of the terminal leave period. This preauthorization shall be sent to MCSC before the ADSM departs his or her final duty station to commence terminal leave. It shall not include authorization for any private sector care or specialty care. ADSMs enrolled overseas traveling or returning stateside while on terminal leave should contact the OCONUS MCSC for private sector care authorizations. Refer to HA Policy “Enrollment of Active Duty Service Members in Terminal Leave Status” 20120514; HA Policy, “Policy Memorandum for Preauthorization of Routine and Urgent Medical Care Provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs to Active Duty Service Members in Terminal Leave Status” 20090116. ADSMs and the Integrated Disability Evaluation System (IDES) The Physical Evaluation Board Liaison Officer shall work with the RMC  to process referrals for Compensation and Pension (C&P) examinations at  the DVA. The RMC will ensure the administrative documentation  required for C&P referrals per TOM, Chapter 8.5 are completed prior to transmitting to the MCSC. ADSM to an Advanced Rehabilitation Center (ARC) ADSM amputee patients will be referred to DoD ARCs for assessment before authorizing care in the purchased care.  See ASD(HA) memorandum, 14 Dec 16, Referral of ADSMs to an ARC. 15.3. 15.4 Other health insurance (OHI) is insurance acquired through an employer, entitlement program or  other source. The RMC will instruct Prime beneficiaries with OHI to  submit referral requests to their primary health insurer and follow the guidance provided by their primary health insurer for referral appointments. Under federal law, TRICARE is the secondary payer to all  health benefits and insurance plans, except for Medicaid, TRICARE  supplements, the Indian Health Service or other programs or plans as  identified by the Defense 15.4.

"Pay Patients" are prioritized for care after ADSMs, Prime AD Family  Members, Prime Retirees/Family members, AF Family Members not  enrolled in TRICARE Prime, and T-Plus enrollees.  "Pay Patients" are  eligible to be seen within the MTF if  capacity exists. If MTFs have specialty capability and capacity, MTFs are highly  encouraged to accept self-referral specialty care requests from  TFL/Medicare beneficiaries with or without a referral/request from their  civilian PCMs. These beneficiaries should be afforded the opportunity to be seen in the MTF  based on the MTF’s capability and capacity and currency case needs. Depending on where the patient presents, the specialty clinic or the RMC  will enter a consult in CHCS.  Obtain civilian physician information  from patient and notate it on the referral. Note: specialty access for TFL/T Plus patients cannot be at the expense of access for Prime patients seeking the same specialty care. Prime patients cannot be deferred to network due to lack of access used by TFL/T-Plus patients. The RMC will provide the referring civilian provider/PCM the results within 10 business days from the kept appointment.   The RMC will track all initial specialty care referral results generated by the MTF, regardless of beneficiary status or enrollment, from the time the referral is written until the results are available to the referring provider or cancelled/not used by the patient. Referrals generated for tracking purposes (e.g., labs, radiology, case management, HEDIS, etc.) do not meet the definition of a specialty care referral/consult and will not be tracked by the RMC (BRs 4, 13.5).   T-1 Referral Tracking 16. 17. Direct Care Referral Results  If there is a kept MTF appointment associated with the direct care referral, the referral is considered “closed” and no further action by the RMC is required. (Note:  The referring  AFI44-176  8 SEPTEMBER 2017 No. Decision Point 18. ROFR Referral Results 19. Purchased Care Referral Results 20. CLR Received Description provider should use AHLTA Consult Log to identify which direct care referrals have a specialist report available for review.)  The RMC will check the status of all accepted ROFRs no later than 60 days from receipt of the accepted ROFR. If there is a kept appointment associated with the ROFR, the RMC will provide the specialty care referral report to the referring purchased care provider within 10 business days of the kept specialty encounter. If the patient did not utilize the referral or keep the appointment, the RMC will close the referral in CHCS no later than 180 days from the date of acceptance and annotate {NU} in soft brackets in the CHCS Review Comment field to indicate the patient did not use the referral. Notify the referring network provider.   The RMC will be the MTF’s single POC to receive all purchased care CLRs. The RMC will obtain the initial CLR. Although the RMC does not actively seek CLRs for follow-up visit, the RMC will provide follow-up CLRs, if received, to the referring provider. If  follow-up visit results are received from the specialist, the RMC will  upload results into the Health Artifact and Image Management Solution (HAIMS) and notify the referring provider with a T-CON per BR 31.  The RMC/MTF will import CLRs into HAIMS (see BR 32) and will close the referral in CHCS with a “Deferred Results Received” (Code #23) status. The RMC will notify the referring provider of CLRs via T-Con per BR 31. When to Start “Chasing” CLRs 21. The RMC will initiate efforts to obtain the CLR as soon as a claim is discovered, upon request by the referring provider or no later than 60 days from the date the referral was ordered, whichever occurs first.  21.1. 60-Day Mark 21.2. Claim When a CLR has not been received or documented in the EHR, the RMC will check the applicable claims database for a claim.  If a claim is found, the RMC will request the CLR from the rendering purchased care provider. If there is no response from the provider within 10 calendar days, repeat. If the provider still does not provide the CLR, the RMC will close the referral in CHCS using the status of “Deferred results received” and annotate {CRNRR} in soft brackets in the CHCS Review Comment Field indicating a claim was 57 Tier T-0 T-1 T-1 T-0 T-0 T-0 58 AFI44-176  8 SEPTEMBER 2017 No. Decision Point 21.3.

If there is no claim and the MTF has reminded the patient to use the referral per BRs 10.4 and 13.2 above, the RMC will close the referral in CHCS. The MTF will use the below mandatory closed reason codes in CHCS; use of the other codes is optional. MTFs on MHS GENESIS will follow MHS GENESIS processes.  The RMC will use only one code per referral.

Define process when to close the referral (e.g., after 1, 2, or 3 ‘No Shows” and who will close the referral in CHCS (e.g., the specialty clinic who documented the “No Show,” the RMC, or the referring provider/clinical team).  The RMC will notify the referring provider of all routine priority referrals not used or cancelled by their patients IAW local MTF policy, but no less than monthly. (Note: the RMC should utilize RMS to generate a report by referring provider for the desired date range and provide it to leadership IAW local MTF policy.)  T-1 If immediate results for STAT and urgent priority specialty care referrals  are clinically required, then the PCM/clinical team should request them from  the purchased care specialist. The clinic should provide the purchased care  provider the RMC fax number. If the PCM/clinical team need the referral results for a future scheduled patient appointment regarding the  CLR results, and the CLR results are not in AHLTA, HAIMS or the  medical records, then the PCM/clinical team should provide the RMC as  much prior notice as possible for the RMC to obtain the needed CLR.  MTFs will disable the automatic closure function in CHCS for referrals/consults.  T-1 The RMC shall import the following documents into the EHR within three working days from receipt of results: the initial specialty care CLR; follow-up CLRs; urgent primary care results; and laboratory results and radiology reports that require an authorization. All other loose documents shall be imported into HAIMS by Medical Records per AFI 41-210. MTFs using MHS GENESIS will upload the CLR into MHS GENESIS. Non-MHS GENESIS MTFs will upload the CLR into HAIMS.  T-1 Patient “No Shows” Notify Providers of Unused, Cancelled, Denied Referrals STAT / Urgent Referral  Results Automatic CHCS Closure of Referrals Import CLRS into the EHR MHS GENESIS MTFs The RMC should follow procedures for importing documents into MHS GENESIS and provider notification.  The MTF will create a T-Con and HAIMS entry for each CLR/result. Non-MHS GENESIS MTFs The MTF will associate the T-Con with the HAIMS entry so that the reviewing provider clearly understands which T-Con is  for which HAIMS entry.

For example, Network Results – Cardiology 2/10/14. If the local HAIMS is down, the MTF will select alternative Healthcare Artifact and Image Repository (HAIR) to upload CLRs and include the link to the alternative HAIR in the provider notification T-Con.  The MTF shall not maintain any existing shared folders used for the purpose of storing temporary  results or other Protected Health Information longer than  30 calendar days following the date of the original image upload.  Thereafter, the electronic folder and documents must be deleted (AFI 41-210) 29.1. Shared Folders in Shared Drives Original and Translated CLRs (OCONUS) 29.2. The MTF shall import both the original foreign language and the English translated CLR into HAIMS. The untranslated result/CLR does not have to be signed by the referring provider if the translated result/CLR was already signed. T-1 T-1 Once loaded into HAIMS, the reviewing provider is not required to handwrite or “wet” sign the hard copy result/report. The paper copy of the result/report is not required to be filed into the paper outpatient medical record. However wet signatures and filing of paper copy may be required for special programs (e.g. PRP) or payment issues). Before destroying the original hard copy or electronic result/report, ensure that the scanned document is legible by the provider. Ensure you have a quality check process in place to ensure right patient, right CLR and right record. Correcting errors: The MTF will have a quality check process to minimize PHI/PII errors.
