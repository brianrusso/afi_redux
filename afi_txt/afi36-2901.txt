The  rewrite clearly delineates the revised responsibilities of the offices of HQ AF/CVAP, AFDW/CCP and all Air Force Active Duty General Officers visiting the Washington, DC area. Changes include updates of appropriate telephone, room numbers and addresses. 1.  Visit  Notification.  All  active  duty  Air  Force  GOs  visiting  the  Washington,  DC  area  will notify AFDW/CCP. 2.  Responsible  Agency.  AFDW/CCP  is  the  primary  designated  agency  responsible  for managing  the  Visiting  Generals  Program.    AF/CVAP  will  assist  in  providing  Pentagon  office space and parking requirements for Visiting General Officers (VGOs) conducting business in the Pentagon. 3.  Air Force Active Duty General Officers’ Responsibilities. 3.1.  Each active duty Air Force GO or their staff will notify AFDW/CCP of an anticipated visit to the Washington, DC area. This includes visits to all Air Force and outside agencies, regardless of whether the GO visits the Pentagon.  For example, GOs attending a conference at  the  Jacob  E.  Smart  Building  at  Joint  Base  Andrews,  Marlyand  or  visiting  Fort  Meade, Maryland, must also coordinate their trips with AFDW/CCP. 3.2.  It is the Air Force Vice Chief of Staff’s (AF/CV) policy that visiting GOs use on-base distinguished  visitor  quarters  (DVQs).    AF/CVA,  on  behalf  of  the  AF/CV  will  enforce  the policy on the use of government quarters with the intent to ensure GOs utilize DVQs when on-base  lodging  is  available.    If  the  VGO  believes  using  a  commercial  hotel  would  be advantageous to the government, their office must submit a request in writing to stay off base to the approving authority, the office of AF/CVA, before making reservations in commercial hotels.  The request and justification should be sent via email through AFDW/CCP, who will in turn provide DVQ availability/recommendations to AF/CVA. 3.3.  The visiting generals will provide AFDW/CCP with the following information: 3.3.1.  Dates, times, and mode of travel for arrival and departure. 3.3.2.  Name and rank of accompanying staff officers. 3.3.3.  Purpose of official visit. 3.3.4.  Point of contact and telephone number in the Washington area. 3.3.5.  Lodging requirements. 3.3.6.  Transportation requirements. 3.3.7.  Complete itinerary. 3.4.  The  visiting  generals  will  provide  AF/CVAP  with  the  following  information  for  all Pentagon parking needs for rental cars or U-Drive-It (UDI) vehicles. 3.4.1.  Driver’s  name  and  rank,  vehicle  license  plate  number  and  state,  registration number for government vehicles, and arrival and departure time for parking clearance.  AFI36-2901  24 APRIL 2015   3  4.

AFDW/CCP  notifies  protocol  offices,  lodging  desks,  and  11  LRS,  at  Joint  Base Anacostia-Bolling and Joint Base Andrews of arrival, departure, and related requirements of visiting active duty GOs to include transportation and lodging. 4.2.  AFDW/CCP will provide on-call assistance for requests made after duty hours. 4.3.  AFDW/CCP  will  forward  all  off-base  lodging  requests  to  AF/CVA  with  pertinent information on DVQ availability. 5.  HQ AF/CVAP Responsibilities. 5.1.  AF/CVAP will maintain and schedule three offices for visiting generals to use while at the  Pentagon.

These offices are used for a short term and not for GOs PCSing in to or out of the Washington, DC area. 5.2.
