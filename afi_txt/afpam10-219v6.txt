References, Abbreviations, Acronyms and Terms. Related publications, abbreviations, acronymsand terms used in this volume are listed in Attachment 1. Figure 1.1.  Southwest Asia Bare Base Support Facilities. 1.2.  Purpose. This volume was developed to  provide deployment information, which will allow engi-neers and logistic planners to pl an for, design, establish and sustai n Aerospace Expeditionary Force air-bases. When used in conjunction with Volume 5 of this series, theater and wing planners, advance echelon(ADVON) team members and deploying units’ expeditionary engineers will have the basic tools requiredto identify and employ consistent  standards and expectations across the service components for infra-structure development, security and sustainment support for expeditionary bases. This volume is notintended to provide a definitive de sign or layout applicable for every  type of deployment. Rather, it isintended to provide the planning criteria and background necessary to: 1.2.1.  Determine what facilities are required to support Air Force and joint service deployments con-ducted for Aerospace Expeditionary Forces operations. 1.2.2.  Identify what forces, equipment and resources are required to provide adequate support facili-ties. 1.2.3.  Understand the factors that affect transition between initial and temporary standards. 1.2.4.  Sustain facility operations within conditions that require a range from austere to initial to tem-porary standard. 8AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 20061.3.  Scope. The materials in this volume are most helpful when used as an update to bare base planning.It updates bare base planning criteria to consider  various Expeditionary Aerospace Force (EAF) deploy-ment strategies used to support theater of operations (TO) locations. It provides: planning, design, layoutand construction considerations based on force deployment; additional information on deployment time-lines; expected facility requirements along the timeline; information on  tailoring of forces and supportpackages; and lessons learned based approaches to sustaining facilities and utilities. 1.4.  Background. Prior to 1989, the Air For ce was postured against one primary threat, the SovietUnion. Much of our force was fo rward deployed and if called to fight, would do so from home base orwould deploy to a well-established, permanently manned facility. While our mobility forces deployed insupport of humanitarian operations, our combat forces generally did no t deploy away from well-estab-lished bases. Figure 1.2.  1980s Cold War Overseas Basing. 1.4.1.  As permanent forward ba sing was lost, more rapidly deployable, U.S.-based forces wererequired to assume greater responsibilities to support operations. The ability to project power quicklyacross the globe was becoming mo re of a requirement. In the 1990s , while the number of Air Forcewings and personnel were being reduced, the requi rements for support of operations abroad wereincreasing. 1.4.2.  Since the Gulf War, deployment of both combat and support forces has increasingly been tomore austere forward locations – this has become a way of life for the Air Force. The Air Force stoodup numerous expeditionary bases in much the same way that the Navy and Marines approached expe-ditionary basing. This approach to  deployments led to the Air Fo rce reorganizing under the Expedi-tionary Aerospace Force construct in January 2000. To support the EAF construct, AerospaceExpeditionary Forces (AEFs) are formed that operationally link ge ographically separated units intoten AEFs, each with a designated lead wing. There are also five mobility lead wings designated to pro-vide global mobility and  a constant flow of vital supplies,  equipment and other resources from theUnited States and allied nations into a theater of operations. AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 20069Figure 1.3.  Permanent Overseas Basing in 2005. Figure 1.4.  Overseas Basing Supporting Global War on Terrorism – 2005. 1.4.3.  This publication provides  guidance for planning and developm ent of expeditionary airfieldsthat support associated missions in accordance with Joint Publication 4-04,  Joint Doctrine for CivilEngineering Support. This publication also addresses expeditionary airfield development planning forthe orderly and efficient management, development of land, facilities and infrastructure. The goal is totake the intent and guidance of Air Force and joint infrastructure and installation regulations and apply10AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006them to expeditionary operations. This publication is not intended to address all aspects of expedition-ary airfield planning. For instance, the combatant commander specifies the construction standards forexpeditionary facilities under his responsibility. These standards are established to ensure that projectssupport the commander’s intent and concept of operations. Figure 1.5.  Air Force 2005 World Wide Deployed Presence. 1.5.  Base and Construction Standard Terminology and Definitions. Within  expeditionary andlong-term operations, there are four types of base camps: forward op erating locations (FOL), forwardoperating base (FOB), main operating base (MOB) and intermediate staging base (ISB). Figure 1.6.  Main Operating Bases in Southwest Asia. 1.6.  Planning for Initial Standard Expeditionary Airbases. Today’s EAF mobility concept of "light,lean and lethal" requires rapid deployment. An AEF wing, group, squadron or unit may deploy to an aus-tere bare base location that has a runway, taxiways, parking ramp and a source of water that can be madepotable. The deployment has often been accomplished with smaller, tailored Unit Type Code (UTC) pack-ages and with a mix of aircraft. An austere forward airbase's runway, taxiways and parking ramp may notAFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 200611be adequate to meet the requirement for all planned deployed forces; additional engineering forces, suchas the Air Force’s Rapid Engineer Deployable H eavy Operations Response Squadron Engineers (REDHORSE), or the Navy’s Construction Battalions (CBs or Seabees) or Army Combat Heavy Engineers,may be required to provide repairs, upgrading and/or  expansion to allow full, planned mission use. Thelocation may also have limited vertical facilities and utilities that can be used, but may have to be repairedprior to occupancy for its final intended purpose. Ma ny locations may have to re ly on air mobility f ormost or all support. Besides having to use tailored UTC packages for aircraft and personnel, support pack-ages may have to be further tailored to make them lighter. Some support operations may have to initiallyexist as austere, while waiting for resource and logistics capability to robust facilities. Engineers at austerelocations need to plan for increased reliance on expedient expeditionary construction techniques to ensuremission accomplishments while waiting for upgrades. Developmental delays are usually related toearly-on, airlift-only logistics support for the forward location being dedicated to joint operational supportof other services, such as Army and Marine units and special operations forces. Expedient facilities maybe the fill-in method for operating in initial austere locations. Guidance on expedient engineering methodscan be found in AFPAM 10-219, Volume 7, Expedient Construction Methods. 12AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006Chapter 2   AIR EXPEDITIONARY FORCE BARE BASE PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT 2.1.  Overview. During the last decade of the Twentieth Century, the US military witnessed many transi-tions: an end to th e Cold War, semi-permanent overseas basing with stateside reinforcement; OperationDESERT SHIELD prepositioning along with mass transportation and large scale deployment; low inten-sity conflicts ruled by geopolitical  diplomacy and limited military forces; joint and coalition peacekeep-ing forces; deployments for military actions other than war;  and EAF operations to support rapid, globaldeployment. Operation DESERT SHIELD is considered a classic case for lar ge-scale joint deploymentand Global Reach-Global Power force projection to bare bases. Still, DESERT STORM demonstrated thatthere were many expeditionary combat support issues  to be resolved to im prove global deployments.Rapid and continually evolving operational a nd beddown requirements during Operation ENDURINGFREEDOM (OEF) and Operation IRAQI FREEDOM (OIF) drove the Air Force to the Air ExpeditionaryTask Force (AETF) force module concept of operations. This concept provides clearer planning guidancefor opening and establishing airbases in an  expeditionary environment. Engineering planners must con-sider GMTF CONOPS, mission requirements, climate,  host nation capabilities, anticipated operationalduration and airfield and facilities conditions during all phases of the five force modules. Figure 2.1.  Tent City during Operation ENDURING FREEDOM. 2.2.  AETF Force Modules. Force modules provide the framework to  systematically present capabilityto rapidly open an airfield, establish operational capability and conduct air operations thereafter. A forcemodule is defined as a grouping of combat and expeditionary combat support UTCs with accompaniedsupplies and required non-unit resuppl y and personnel necessary to sust ain forces for a minimum of 30days. Elements of force modules ar e linked together or are uniquely  identified so that they may beextracted from or adjusted as an entity in the  Joint Operations Planning and Execution System (JOPES)databases to enhance flexibility and usefulness of  the operations planning and execution process. Forcemodules provide planners a simple methodology for matching specific personnel and equipment for spe-cific mission requirements. AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006132.3.  Force Modules. Force modules help standardize the planning and execution of how forces areemployed and ensure a repeat able and effective process. The five force modules are  open the airbase,command and control, establish the airbase, generate the mission and operate the airbase. Figure 2.2.provides a graphic representation of force module deployment. Figure 2.2.  AETF Force Module Phased Deployment. 2.3.1.  Open the Airbase. This force module will normally arrive first and assess the airbase for estab-lishment of airfield operating pa rameters, command and control a nd supporting host-nation supportcapabilities. It contains a small force (150 personnel) to provide the capability for: command and con-trol, force protection, cargo and passenger handling, logistics, communications, airfield operationsand establishing minimum operating strip, force accountability and reception and beddown of fol-low-on modules. The capabilities in the module should rapidly establish an initial operating capability(IOC) in approximately 36 hours from arrival of forces. 2.3.1.1.  This module contains capabilities to open an airbase regardless of the follow-on missionsupport requirements for a specific mission, airframe or weapons system. 2.3.1.2.  Open the airbase forces will also provide the capabil ity to plan the layout for follow-onairbase infrastructure. These forces may be  supporting other service components or coalitionallies. Operations may be flying or non-flying, combat or non-combat or any combination thereof.This module will most likely deploy in the C minus timeframe. Some portions of this module maydepart when the airfield is  minimally capable of supporting the follow-on forces. As the forcesassigned to this module are completing their mission, forces from establish the airbase module areassuming their responsibilities in addition to extending the airfield’s existing capabilities. 2.3.2.  Command and Control (C2). The C2 module contains the capabilities to establish an air expe-ditionary wing command and  control structure and is estimated to be at IOC in approximately 16hours after arrival of forces. This module assumes command of the airbase from the initial elements ofthe open the airbase module and establishes permanent secure and non-secure communications capa-bilities. 2.3.2.1.  This module contains the capabilities to establish initial maintenance group, mission sup-port group, operations group and medical group staffs. This initial capability will be rounded outonce the establish the airbase and operate the airbase modules arrive. Secure communicationsand intelligence are key capabilities to establishing control. 2.3.2.2.  This module begins at some point on or after C-0 and must be in place prior to any com-mand elements leaving from the open the airbase force module. 14AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 20062.3.3.  Establish the Airbase. This module contains  the capabilities to support most missions orweapon systems. Together with the open and generate modules, it provides the airfield’s earliest capa-bility to execute its assigned mission. 2.3.3.1.  The establish the airbase module will provide capabilities  to build and modify existingand deployed infrastructure (petroleum, oils and  lubricants (POL), munitions storage and operat-ing sites, maintenance shelters, tents, electrical), command and control mission specific forces,expand to 24-hour day/night mission operations, e nhance force protections, communications andairbase operations as necessary. This module initiates on or after C-0 and overlaps the ef forts ofthe open module. The effectiveness of this module is dependent upon integration with open theairbase and generate the mission modules. The module is estimated to be at IOC in approximately10 days. 2.3.3.2.  This module contains forces that increase exped itionary airfield capabilities to supportexpanded and sustainment operations. This includes:  lodging, finance, aerial port, infrastructure,emergency response (fire crash rescue, medical, security forces, safety and EOD), personnel sup-port for contingency operations (PERSCO) and communications. 2.3.4.  Generate the Mission. This force module contains the capabilities to conduct the desired mili-tary and mission effects required by the combatant commander. This module combines two subordi-nate force modules: a Core UTC package (CUP) a nd a mission platform package. The CUPs containthe lead aviation package and dir ect aviation support (e.g. maintena nce, munitions, etc) associatedwith the aviation capability. CUP titles usually identify the type of aircraft deployed. The mission plat-form package contains combat  support capabilities that support th e aviation package (e.g. weather,intelligence, operations support, maintenance supervision and communications). 2.3.4.1.  The mission support elements of this force module may begin to flow before C+0 day andwill overlap the open and establish modules. Mission generation is not achievable without integra-tion of open, C2 and establish modules. This module is intended to conduct operations within 36hours of initial arrival and will be at IOC in approximately 80 hours from the start of the open theairbase module. 2.3.4.2.  The ability of this force module to reach  IOC is heavily dependent on the strategic flowof resources and the deployment of mission aircraft and operators. 2.3.5.  Operate the Airbase. This module contains the mission support capabilities needed to achievefull operating capability. Forces in this module make initial operating capabilities more robust and cansustain mission generation forces for up to 30 days. 2.3.5.1.  The module provides capabilities to enhance force protection, cargo handling, quality oflife activities (chaplain, fitness, library, health care, feeding and sheltering) and reach-back capa-bilities (supply, U.S. mail, military pay). This module begins to flow on or after C+2 and reachesclosure on or before day C+14. The module is estimated to be at IOC approximately 7 days fromarrival. 2.3.5.2.  The operate the airbase module begins the transition from austere and initial constructionstandards to temporary construction standards as directed by  mission duration and combatantcommander requirements. 2.4.  Bare Base Terminology, Definitions and Types. A bare base is defined as a location with a func-tional runway, taxiway, parking areas and a source of water that can  be made potable. The location wasAFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 200615chosen to make the base capable  of supporting all  assigned and supporting aircraft and provide missionessential resources in a timely an d combat effective manner. These resources would include logisticalsupport and service to the infrastructure composed of people, facilities, equipment and supplies. This barebase concept requires prepackaged mobile facilities,  utilities and support equipment that can be rapidlydeployed and installed. Expeditionary airbases are de fined by the level of infrastructure, development,operational duration and missions that are present or will be deployed to the area. By combining the typeof airbase with the outlined facilities  standards listed later in this chapter, the CE planner can greatlyreduce the time required to identify, validate and source requirements for various locations. The varioustypes of expeditionary airfields include forward operating location, forward operating base, main operat-ing base, intermediate staging area and warm base. 2.4.1.  Forward Operating Location (FOL). FOLs are airfields  utilized for short-term, operationallydefined missions such as counter -drug or combat search and rescue (CSAR)  and have very limitedfacilities and amenities. A FOL is normally an austere location requiring very little engineering effortto execute mission requirements. 2.4.2.  Forward Operating Base (FOB). FOBs are airfields used to support tactical, CSAR and recon-naissance operations without establishing full support facilities. FOBs  may be used for an extendedduration. Support by a main operating base will be required to provide backup support for a forwardoperating base. 2.4.3.  Main Operating Base (MOB). Main operating bases are normally occupied by a wing or largerpopulation (550 personnel or more), are continuously operated and posses in-place Air ExpeditionaryWing (AEW) command structures,  robust expeditionary combat support (ECS) and logistics func-tions. 2.4.4.  Intermediate Staging Base (ISB). An ISB is a location or airfie ld used to stage forces prior toinserting combat forces into the  forward theater of operations. Du ring OIF, the US Army utilizedDoha, Kuwait as a staging an d positioning area for the 4 th Infantry Division prior to the initiation ofcombat operations in Iraq. ISBs have lar ge transient cargo and personnel requirements and normallyrequire greater planning factors for cargo ramps and ECS to accommodate large throughput of assets. 2.4.5.  Warm Base. A warm base is  defined as a prepositioned lo cation where initial beddown infra-structure development and prepositioning of assets has occurred th at allow for the rapid deploymentof personnel and weapons systems to an expeditionary location. During OEF and OIF, the Air Forceheated up bases at Masirah Island, Al Udeid, Seeb  and Thumrait to enable the rapid mobilization ofhundreds of aircraft and thousands of personnel. 2.5.  Construction Standards Definitions and Terminology. The combatant commander specifies theconstruction standards for all facilities in theater. These standards are established to ensure that facilitiesmeet mission requirements while minimizing the engineering effort expended for planning and standard-ize quality of life throughout the theater of operation. The following definitions expand those establishedin JP 4-04 and define the construction standards of bare bases and their minimum facility requirements. 2.5.1.  Expeditionary Standard Airbase. An expeditionary standard airbase is a subset of the initialstandard defined in Chapter 1. They are designed and constructed on an expedient basis, usingorganic and service provided equipment and systems and/or host nation resources to support missiondurations of up to 90 days. Focus  will be on providing support, faciliti es and infrastructure systems16AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006necessary to move, receive and beddown deploying forces. Expeditionary standards would be seen atshort term FOL and FOB locations. 2.5.2.  Initial Standard Airbase. An initial standard airbase is designed and constructed on an expedi-ent basis and is characterized by austere facilities requiring minimal engineering effort to initiate mis-sion operations. They are  intended for use by opera tional units upon arrival in theater for a limitedtime ranging up to 6 months. Initial standard facilities may require replacement by more substantial ordurable facilities during the course of operations. The Air Force developed BEAR kits to support ini-tial standard expeditionary airbase deployments. Initial standards would most likely be seen at FOL,FOB and initial operations at MOB and ISB locations. Figure 2.3.  Initial Construction Standard at FOB in Afghanistan. 2.5.3.  Temporary Standard Airbase. For deployments that are expected  to last up to 24 months andwhere Military Construction Program permanent facilities (or even semi-permanent facilities) are notrequired, temporary standard facilities should be programmed. Temporary standards are characterizedby minimum facilities requiring additional engineering effort above that required for initial standards.Temporary standard airbases provide for sustained operations above the requirements of initial stan-dards at locations where a long-term presence is not anticipated. The temporary standards may beused from the start of an operation or as an upgrade from initial standards, if directed by the Combat-ant Commander for mission requireme nts. Temporary standards should increase the efficiency ofoperation, safety, durability, morale and health  standards for deployed personnel. For command andcritical facilities, modular and/or K-Span style fac ilities can be constructed wi th buried water lines,overhead and/or buried electrical  distribution, lighting on poles, buried sewer lines, collection tanksand pumping systems. Dormitories  and some administrative functions may receive hard floors andwalls, or be upgraded or replaced with modular facilities as base growth and mission duration require.General requirements are found within Joint Chief of S taff guidance and are depicted in  Figure 2.4.Theater commanders may vary standards as the situation, forces and location dictates. AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 200617Figure 2.4.  Temporary Construction Standards for Lodging. 2.5.4.  Enduring Presence Construction Standard. For deployments that are anticipated to last longerthan two but less than 10 years, semi-permanent  standards should be planned, programmed and exe-cuted. Semi-permanent standards are designed and constructed with  finishes; materials and systemsselected for moderate energy efficiency; maintenance and life cycle costs. Semi-permanent construc-tion standards may be utilized as initial beddown standards when directed by the component combat-ant commander. Semi-permanent construction projects may exceed local base civil engineer and wingauthority levels. 2.5.4.1.  CE planners must be  extremely knowledgeable about AF programming, funding andauthority levels when planning for semi-permanent locations. Ensure proper coordination withtheater level CE planners an d MAJCOM CE program director ates prior to initiating anylarge-scale construction. 2.5.4.2.  Enduring presence  construction standards are normally set by ag reements between thehost nation and the United S tates and may include permanent or semi-permanent constructionstandards. These agreements will often outlin e conditions and standards the US military mustadhere to while constructing on host nation property as well as cost sharing initiatives that may beput in place to al leviate the expense to US operations. Semi-permanent airbases should be con-structed with a prime emphasis on sustainment and survivability. 2.5.5.  Warm Base Standards. Warm bases are designed and constructed with finishes, materials andsystems selected for sustaining a mobilization base within the theater of operations. A warm base maybe a separate facility with a contract caretaker f unction or a surge area collocated with an operatingbase. Warm bases are positioned to be rapidly heated up through execution of task order contract lineitems in the contractor caretaker  contract. Current AF policy dictates that CE UTCs be deployed toaugment the contractor to ensure base camp is erected to US standards. 2.6.  Expeditionary Airbase Development and Planning Process. The airbase development processhas four main components: antiterrorism and force protection, facility requirements, master planning andconstruction management. 2.6.1.  Antiterrorism and Force Protection (AT/FP). AT/FP and physical security concerns are criticalto the development of expeditionar y airbases and long-term military camps. Incorporating AT/FPrequirements into site planning, selection, and layout is a cr itical and often difficult process. It isessential that CE and Securit y Forces planners work together to  establish a realistic and executable18AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006AT/FP plan to protect US personnel and AF assets. This partnership will ensure that the AT/FP plan isan integrated design consistent with the airbase initial and long-range development plans. 2.6.1.1.  Essential to the base camp planning effort is the early identification of the AT/FP require-ments. Addressing AT/FP concerns early helps to ensure that site location and layout is compatiblewith FP operations and mission accomplishment. Early development of AT/FP and physical secu-rity requirements also helps to reduce both construction and manpower costs. It is easier and morecost effective to establish security measures during the planning process than it is to apply AT/FPand physical security requirements, after the fa ct. AT/FP measures must be considered andincluded at all stages of beddown planning and base development. 2.6.1.2.  IAW DOD Instruction 2000.16 ( DOD Antiterrorism Standards) and DOD 2000.12H(DOD Antiterrorism Handbook) standards for construction of new facilities have been developedto counter possible terrorist threats. These cons truction standards have specific requirements forsuch measures as standoff distance, perimeter barriers and building construction. These minimumstandards must be incorporated into the construction of all facilities rega rdless of the identifiedthreat. Planners must ensure th at they reference command specific  publications regarding forceprotection instructions. CENTAF, USAFE, SOUTHAF and PACAF all have supplemental instruc-tions regarding FP construction standards. C ontact your theater level A7/CE planner for moreinformation. 2.6.2.  Facility Requirements. The combatant comma nder establishes the base camp facility require-ment standard for the theater of operations by operation order (OPORD) fragmentary order. This orderdescribes standards upon which components and subordinate units develop master plans for mission,mission support, base and community support facilities and requi red utilities. These standards areintended to provide the combatan t commander’s expectations to component commanders for basecamp living and operating conditions. 2.6.3.  Master Planning. Master pla nning provides an integrated strategy for constructing and main-taining required facilities while right-sizing budge ts, equipment sets and the CE UTC(s) required tosupport expeditionary operations. The level of deta il of the base camp mast er plan depends on thematurity of the location,  the speed at which the operational need  for a base camp develops and theexpected length of stay. Master plans for expeditionary or initial standard camps may be simply asketch of the camp, while master  plans for temporary or enduring pr esence camps will include fullyengineered construction plans based on complete surveys. Beddown and base planners should ensurethey utilize and comply with gui dance provided in UFC 4-010-01, Design: DOD Minimum Antiter-rorism Standards for Buildings, and with UFC 3-260-01, Design: Airfield and Heliport Planning andDesign, when planning for AEF bases. 2.6.3.1.  Theater level planners will establish a  process to develop, approve and implement basemaster plans. For joint a nd coalition bases, this mechanism must include representation from allaffected service components or coalition allies if applicable. 2.6.3.2.  Using the established  process, component commanders will develop base master plansfor intermediate staging and main operating airbases. Planning utilizing semi-permanent and per-manent construction requires coordination and approval from your numbered air force and majorcommand programs directorate and civil engineer. AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006192.6.3.3.  Theater level or  major command Engineer and Servi ces experts can provide technicalsupport and guidance for expeditionary airbase development if planning is occurring at the unitlevel. 2.6.4.  Construction Management. Executing units will track the development of base construction inaccordance with the master plan  priorities and report progress in accordance with instructions pub-lished by the A7/CE directorate. 2.7.  Operations and Maintenance (O&M). Effective operations and maintenance programs will maxi-mize the life expectancy of base temporary facilit ies at minimum cost to the government. As the opera-tional situation develops, more pe rmanent structures and facilities ma y replace temporary facilities andstructures. Airbase units will follo w service regulations for the operatio ns and maintenance of facilitiesand may hire civilian contractors to manage and operate the base support mission if the operational situa-tion permits. 2.8.  Expeditionary Facilities and Beddown Sets. Detailed listing for expeditionary facilities and barebase beddown assets can be found in AFPAM 10-219 Volume 5, Bare Base Conceptual Planning Guide,and AFH 10-222 Volume 1, Guide to Bare Base Development, and AFH 10-222 Volume 2, Guide to BareBase Assets. 2.9.  Better Deployable Facilities. Facilities and equipment used after Viet Nam have been improved tomake them more deployable and livable. Major improvements were made to meet logistical and missionrequirements for increased deployability for mission and base support packages, with the greatest stridesoccurring in the two decad es between Viet Nam and Desert Shield. The post- World War II and KoreaGray Eagle kits were heavy and bulky and required excessive man-hours to position and erect. Additionalequipment was added, but repackaged into sizes that are more manageable. This effort created the small550-person Harvest Eagle packages  of the early 1970s. Likewise, lar ger deployment kits were tested,which led to the 1970s Harvest Bare packages. Harvest Bare was refi ned, but testing led to the purchaseof new equipment in the  mid-1980s such as the Ha rvest Falcon system. The  Harvest Falcon packageswere fielded to allow deployment support for a 3,300-person wing and up to 55,000 personnel total. 2.10.  Transportability Issues versus Developmental Timelines. While more user and mission friendlybare base beddown packages have evolved, the packages are still not light and small enough to allowrapid deployment by the current fl eet of large frame transports. Table 2.1. shows the typical number ofaircraft missions required to s upport the deployment of the s tandard sets (without passengers aboard).Additional missions may be required if additional site preparation is required. The erection of many cur-rent deployment packages are also man-hour intens ive. This limits their application by smaller numbersof personnel that deploy to a site on an ADVON or predeployment team, who must perform site surveys.Also, the current Housekeeping sets are difficult to break up for use by small teams that require some ini-tial short-term facilities. Given time for shipment and erection, these assets provided good support duringthe initial phases of a deploymen t to Southwest Asia. During the fi rst few weeks of Operation DES ERTSHIELD deterrent efforts, the tonnage required fo r initial air and ground fo rce projection shipmentsdepended on air transport. The air transport system was totally choked in spite of many prepositioned civilengineer assets in country or in USAFE and some personnel faced austere conditions. However, time linesfor Desert Storm actually allowed about 95 percent of the transferred force-buildup tonnage to be sent bysealift. Keep in mind that the disparity in missions between the legacy (Harvest) sets and the BEAR setsis due in part to the light/lean nature of BEAR and that BEAR has optional assets that are added only as20AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006needed (e.g. ROWPUs, MAAS, revetmen t kits, various dome shelters, et c). These assets are sometimesreferred to as BEAR playbook options. Table 2.1.  Mission Support to Various Deployment Sets.

Airlift Limitations versus Developmental Timeline. To meet current AEF taskings, air transportmay be the only method of delivery for several months --this is recognized by all services. To meet theirneeds, the Army developed the Force Provider deployment packages, which evolved from a cross-versionof Harvest Falcon-type assets packaged in Harvest Eagle-size packages. The Air Force has tested lighterweight, more streamlined Harvest Falcon kits that address the phasing required to reach more remote, aus-tere bases when these locations are airlift constrained. The Air Force is also developing and programmingreplacement shelters and deployable  electrical, water and sewerage sy stems that are lighter and moredeployable. The next decade is slated to see many improvements and changes to the deployment packagesto allow rapid beddown of forces to meet the full spectrum of contingency deployments. The programs formanaging and updating bare base a ssets now fall under the BEAR pr ogram. When possible, plannersshould investigate the opportunity of utilizing sealift, convoys and railways to move large assets and freeup airlift. 2.12.  Real World Transport/Logistics Lessons Learned : During Operation ALLIED FORCE (OAF)in Yugoslavia and Kosovo, RED HOR SE units in Europe were able  to mobilize prepositioned heavyequipment and beddown assets from  Italy and move them via sealift  and rail. On every occasion, theassets arrived ahead of equipment and resources that were prioritized as critical assets and moved via air-lift. The great advantage to sea and rail is the elimination of weight constraints that occur when moving byair. Due to severe lack of Class IV construction material in Albania, Army and Navy teams had problemserecting billeting, showers, latrines and other expeditionary combat support requirements. Within 7 daysof arrival at Albania, RED HORSE  had shipped in over  632 short tons of h eavy equipment embeddedwith plywood, geo-textile materials, hand tools and other critical construction assets that were not beingmoved due to airlift limitations. Coordination and lo cation of opportune sealift through Military TrafficAFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 200621Management Command (MTMC) took  three days. The shipment includ ed environmental control units(ECU), bundles of AM-2 mat, expeditionary shower/shave and latrine sets. Task Force Hawk had been onthe ground three weeks but it was not until the arrival of the RED HORSE assets that they received sani-tary and hygiene facilities and ear th-moving heavy equipment. CE and RED HORSE planners coordi-nated this effort outside of the prioritization of the OAF movement center and tactical airlift control center(TACC). Figure 2.5.  Sealift of Military Equipment. 2.13.  Mission Considerations. Requirements for changes in depl oyment packages are driven by AEFmission considerations. To meet AEF rapid deployment, full-spectrum global commitments, some restric-tions may have to be imposed for initial mission planning, such as: 2.13.1.  Compression requirements for initial deployment timelines. 2.13.2.  Restrictive limits on the number of support personnel on the ground during the initial 3 to 14day periods. 2.13.3.  Limited initial flow of equipment and support  packages, as well as spreading out follow-uppackages over more airlift missions. 2.13.4.  Sending selected mission support UTCs in prior to C+0 Day to ready the base. 2.13.5.  Employing joint concepts  of support and deployment with  Air National Guard, Air ForceReserve Command, Army, Marine and Navy forces. 2.13.6.  All of these may be considered upfront to meet theater commander air superiority and supportcampaigns. Finally, the total number of transport aircraft available may be the critical factor for the-ater locations that are landlocked, have no accessible or nearby seaports, or lack road or other avail-able land routes. 2.14.  Influence of Base Type and Location. Typical AEF mission planning considerations will dependin a large part on the type and location of the depl oyment airbases. Mission timelines for initial supportforce and equipment UTCs will be different for each of the following situations. 22AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 20062.14.1.  Austere airfields for support of missions by special oper ational forces, A-10s, MC- andAC-130s and special operations and attack helicopters, where the initial arriving aircraft may be lim-ited to C-17s and C-130s. 2.14.2.  Large, former Soviet-bloc airfields that require some repair of hangars, maintenance facilities,utilities and pavements, but can s upport all types of aircraft and te nt city beddowns and can be par-tially supported with contracts, trucked-in supplies and modular facilities. 2.14.3.  Recovered, enemy commercial and military ai rfields that have ether been denied duringenemy retrograde or coalition ai r and ground bombardment. These were the predominant airfieldsoccupied during the 2002-2003 OEF and OIF. 2.14.4.  Typical bare bases, which can accompany initial fighters, transports (both military airlift andCivil Reserve Air Fleet) and helicopter missions, but may have limited modes of supply and transport. 2.14.5.  Large airbases with a full mix of aircraft  and support facilities from  numerous military ser-vices or countries and supportable by several modes of transportation and supply. Figure 2.6.  Joint Forces Airbase in Bosnia. AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 200623Figure 2.7.  Various Construction Standards in Bosnia. 2.15.  Developmental Timeline Considerations. Based on the Air Force Chief of S taff's Sight Picturesand the Agile Combat Support (ACS ) Global Military Task Force (GMTF) program to implement AEFdeployments, the timelines for deployment are e nvisioned through a force mo dule approach. The AirForce requires any upgrade of the bare base assets to be modular, scaleable and to meet the needs for fol-low-on set consistency, maintaining full flying operational support and providing theater interoperability. 2.15.1.  Timeline Goals. The typical timeline goal  for a 3300-person beddown is fourteen days, withinitial flying operations achieved by C+72 Hours and sustainment operations phasing in after fourteendays. In order to meet a full mi ssion capability within C+14 days, open the base efforts must beplanned to provide equipment and resources in response to mis sion and manning requirements thatallow for immediate build-up and beddown upon arrival at the expeditionary airbase. 2.15.2.  Force Modules and BEAR Asse ts. To meet the timelines for force module IOC, BEAR setsare packaged to more closely align with the goal  of the force modules. For  instance, BEAR sets arestreamlined for weight and TEMPER tents are being replaced with more readily deployable systemsthat are simpler to erect with fewer personnel (the Small Shelter System was widely deployed duringOEF and OIF). The overall packagin g allows use without major tail oring to meet smaller missiondeployments or beddowns for joint operational support of other branch of service forces. These con-cepts are depicted in Figure 2.8., which shows both the strategic roadmap force module timeline andthe conceptual modules for a BEAR package that would meet the requirements of deployment. 24AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006Figure 2.8.  BEAR Sets Supporting a Force Module Beddown. 2.15.3.  One major planning consideration is plugging in an open the airbase module (team) prior toC+0 Day to begin beddown. With an open the airbase beddown package, which provides short-termaustere shelter and basic hygiene, a beddown team would initiate beddown with either a tailored Har-vest Eagle system or BEAR system (when  fully adopted). For civil engineers, the open the airbaseteam could include a combination  of RED HORSE, Prime BEEF and 49 th Material MaintenanceGroup (49 MMG) BEAR team personnel to prepare the site, erect and install facilities, equipment andsome utilities. For locations that are not in higher threat areas, planning for these types of bases shouldconsider use of one of the contractor augmen tation programs for early beddown opera tions. Theseprograms are the Air For ce Contract Augmentation Program (AFCAP), the Army Logistics CivilAugmentation Program (LOGCAP) and the Navy Contingency Construction Capability (CONCAP).These are covered more broadly in Chapter 8 of this volume. 2.16.  Engineering Considerations. Most of the engineering pla nning factors and detailed mechanicalprocedures for calculating requirements are covered in AFPAM 10-219, Volume 5. These civil engineerconsiderations are based primarily on AEF lessons learned. 2.17.  Survey, Expeditionary Site Mapping (formerly GeoReach) and Other Information BasedPlans. Deploying units and theater planners must have  good information on what is at a location andavailable nearby. Developing a bare base support plan requires accurate information. Knowing what mis-sions will be present is  a major factor in determin ing what should be included  and the amount of detailrequired. Experience with OAF, OEF, and Operation NOBLE ANVIL has shown that AEF missions canbe much more fluid than previous Air Force depl oyments, usually because other services and partnernation military services are involved. 2.17.1.  When there is a requirement to support new contingency missions, there may not be a specificoperation plan (OPLAN) that provides specific details for the location. Rather, an operations plan inAFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 200625concept form (CONPLAN) may have to be used to deter mine basic requirements. Whether anOPLAN or CONPLAN is used, an all-services, Timed-Phased Force and Deployment Data (TPFDD)is required that is associated with the base. The TPFDD database will contain all forces (except possi-ble specifics on special operations forces) and the deployment timing required to deploy in support ofan OPLAN or CONPLAN. 2.17.2.  Problems can develop when all potential missions are not well defined; when this occurs, civilengineer planners must make assumptions based on the best information available with respect to totalmission requirements. Theater ADVON teams, through the Expediti onary Site Survey Process(ESSP), may have surveyed the site and created an Expeditionary Site Mapping comprehensive instal-lation picture (CIP) with GPS  located survey inputs. Some of the  more specific requirements forpotential mission support of an airfield may be available from site surveys conducted by Air MobilityOperations Groups (AMOG), Tanker Airlift Control Elements (TALCE), Contingency ResponseGroups (CRG), Special Tactics Teams (STTs) and previously completed Base Support Plans (BSPs)or theater Civil Engineer Support Plans (CESPs). It is imperative that A7 or theater level CE plannershave the appropriate security clearance level for joint and AF war plan efforts. 2.17.3.  With the exception of support  to special operations forces, you  should be able to obtain andreview (before going on the surv ey) the TPFDD to deter mine the basic deployment forces that willdrive the population-based requirements. Examples of basic information are the number of aircraft bytype, the total base population and the phased base population over time, transient forces and expectedduration of the operation. 2.17.4.  Good sources of information are operations  plans, base maps, aerial photographs, construc-tion drawings, past site surveys,  data contained in intelligence office documents, information from apreviously deployed unit and in formation from the theater, Aerospace Expeditionary Force Center(AEFC), or MAJCOM staffs. Until Expeditionary Site Mapping has reached full maturity, civil engi-neers need to obtain both un classified and classified information as best they can for each initialdeployment. When replacing a deployed unit, incoming civil engineers should use the SECRET Inter-net Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) and s ecure telecommunications to determine what mayreally be required to replace the current force for sustainment operations. 2.18.  Airfield Surveys and Operational Data Collection. The success of an expeditionary airfield isdirectly related to the c ondition of the runway. This is reflected  in the effort the Combined Force AirComponent Commander (CFACC), Combined Force Land Component Command (CFLCC) and variousorganizations put into the deploymen t of numerous pavement evaluation  teams. In light of limited andconstricted transportation into many of these areas, it is critical that planners identify the correct require-ment and task the appropriate team.  The following teams and their capabilities are listed to assist in thisselection. 2.18.1.  AFCESA Pavement Evaluation Team. The AFCESA Pavement Evaluation Team is governedby AFI 32-1041, Airfield Pavement Evaluations. The AFCESA Pavement Evaluation programfocuses on airfield support to MAJCOM/NAF/CFACC and bases by providing the following servicesfor both peacetime and contingency operations: 2.18.1.1.  Develop pavement guidance and criteria. 2.18.1.2.  Perform airfield structural pavement evaluations. 2.18.1.3.  Perform airfield frictional characteristics (skid) evaluations. 26AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 20062.18.1.4.  Provide technical support to the MAJCOM and bases. 2.18.2.  Tanker Airlift Control Elements (TALCE). Air Mobility Command (AMC) trained, equippedand tasked airfield evaluation teams perform site surveys to determine airfield suitability for aircraftoperations. TALCE units are tasked through HQ AMC-TACC/ XOPM, Scott AFB, DSN 779-3071.Airfield surveys are published on AMC IMT 174, Ai rfield Survey, and are used to update AirfieldSuitability and Restrictions Report (ASRR). ASRRs include airfield geometry assessment, naviga-tional aids (NAVAID), hazards to flight determinations, aircraft parking area aprons, pavement flowcapabilities, and maximum (aircraft) on ground (MOG) capacity. 2.18.3.  Global Assessment Teams (GAT) were created by AMC during OEF to serve as the advanceplanning team for AMOG/TALCE units. GATs establish austere initial airfield operations. GATs aretasked through HQ AMC-TACC/XOPM, Scott AFB, DSN 779-3071. 2.18.4.  Contingency Response Groups (CRG) are a first-in, mu lti-discipline force that secure andestablish airfield operations. CRG are comprised of  Security Forces, Initial  Airlift Support, CivilEngineering and Communications. CRG are positioned and  equipped for short-term operations anddeployment. CRGs are tasked through the Unified Combatant Command and  equipped to completeairfield surveys as detailed on AMC Form 174. 2.18.5.  RED HORSE units are mobile, heavy construction squadrons that are equipped to provide air-field assessment and repairs. 2.18.6.  Special Tactics Teams (STT) are Special Operations team s used to survey and certifysemi-prepared airfields, landing zones and assault strips via AF  Forms 3822 and ASRR. Surveysinclude geometrics, NAVAIDS, hazards to flight, semi-prepared airfield load bearing capability. STTare tasked by the 720th Special Tactics Group at Hurlburt Field, Florida, DSN 579-4250. 2.18.7.  Expeditionary Site Survey Process (ESSP) standardizes the process of producing airfield sur-vey data and providing decision makers with reli able and substantive mission planning information.ESSP deploys survey teams of high trained individuals to perform pavement evaluation, full spectrumthreat assessment, airfield suitability reports and beddown surveys with LOGCAT/Expeditionary SiteMapping integration. The directorate of logistics readiness (HQ US AF/ILG) is responsible for AirForce ESSP policy and guidance, while the MAJCOM logistics plans function provides oversight forall expeditionary site surveys in their AOR. Additional information on ESSP roles and responsibilitiescan be found in AFI 10-404, Base Support and Expeditionary Site Planning. 2.18.8.  The National Geospatial -Intelligence Agency (NGA; formerly the National Imagery andMapping Agency or NIMA) has completed surveys  of all airfields worldwide. During OperationsNOBLE ANVIL, OAF, OEF and OIF planners utilized these surveys for beddown planning purposes.This proved risky since less than 1%  of structural data is taken fr om true technical information. Themajority of facility capacity and  capability is estimated from imager y taken of similar airfields or istaken from reports of airfield managers. This data may be skewed by host nations for political or eco-nomic reasons. NGA information provides a good initial baseline and satellite imagery for initial plan-ning. 2.19.  Priority Requirements During Planning. Based on lessons learned, it is very important to iden-tify those items, which must be in the initial support packages, but are not normally included. If a standarddeployment package flows as establis hed in the TPFDD and a site survey  shows that there is a criticalneed to have another package compon ent arrive earlier, then this is a  major concern that should be ele-AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 200627vated. Heavyweight, large-cube items, such as construction equipment, fire trucks and dump trucks, havebeen left on a ramp at an intermediate aerial port or back at a theater's prepositioned-storage site awaitingairlift support when transportation flows are airlift constrained. Based on the mission, surveys must deter-mine if initial beddown activities can be accomplished without a large amount of site preparation. If initialbeddown efforts require these assets, then alternate procedures, scheduling or support may be required toallow this to happen. Actions must  be coordinated between theater planners, the AEF wing and UnitedStates Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM). Here is an example. 2.19.1.  A former Soviet base now controlled by a partner nation will be used for a force beddown. Ifyou just looked at aerial photos and used old Soviet-era intelligence reports, the base would appear tohave an adequate runway, taxiway and ramp, as well as  a water source and so me damaged flightlinebuildings that can be eas ily repaired. However, a site survey might show  that the base is on arock-hard, rocky surface that has toxic environmental spills affecting some areas of the ground surfaceand water sources. While expedient repairs to existing facilities are  practical, they would requirestructural work and for safety reasons, these efforts would have to be completed prior to occupancy. 2.19.2.  If the deployment buildup were to be phased in over several months, the base could be devel-oped without deploying additional up-front resources. However, if a 3300-person bare base wererequired by C+23 Day, then the TPFDD would have to be adjusted. Deployment packages should betailored to reflect Prime BEEF UTCs as one of the initial teams  arriving with AFCAP (or other con-tractors) and RED HORSE personnel to: clean up or contain the spil l, conduct more arduous surfacepreparations, repair the flightline buildings and possibly drill a well, provide additional reverse osmo-sis water purification units (ROWPU) or supply an alternative means for obtaining drinking water. 2.20.  Coalition or Host Nation Support Capabilities and Limitations. A host nation (HN) is a nationwhere US military personnel are deployed by government invitation or international agreement. A partnernation is a nation where US  military personnel deploy by  government invitation or international agree-ment and their military forces may be participants  under a military agreement or  treaty. A host nation'sresources, assets and facilities may exist at the location and may be available for use or support. Theaterand State Department sources, such as military liaison offices or partner nation military personnel on sta-tion, can sometimes provide valuable information  on host nation capabilities and information on: con-tracts, sources of supply, availability of equipment and materials (as well as an idea of the cost to dobusiness) and points of contact w ith the local government. Another im portant piece of information per-tains to the willingness of a host nation to provide facility and utility support and joint use of assets. 2.20.1.  The availability of HN s upport may enable CE units to  reduce support and transportationrequirements by securing formal and informal agreements with HN authorities. Contact your wing ortheater judge advocate for guidance prior to entering into any agreements or interpretation of existingagreements. The Joint Forces Commander (JFC) usually establishes a single office to serve as theexecutive agency to manage and coordinate host nation support during wartime. Airbase and AirComponent Command representatives use this of fice, according to JFC re gulations and guidelines,when entering into any formal agreement with HN authorities. 2.20.2.  Units that deployed in support of OEF found  that conducting smaller humanitarian and civicassistance (HCA) support projects for local communities often improved the overall ability to obtainlocal resources and labor for on-base work. Even when there are few local resources, it is good to con-duct humanitarian efforts to improve the political climate in terms of host nation support for the loca-tion and effort. It is important that outgoing civil engineers orient, familiarize and even introduce their28AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006replacement to key local and re gional government points of contact. Even with the willingness oflocal officials to support deployment ef forts, sometimes there are economic  or physical constraintsthat affect use of the deployment site. 2.20.3.  When leasing of land is a  problem, deployed AEF units have  found that Army ContingencyReal Estate Support Teams (CRESTs) can often provide support in-theater. CRESTs can obtainlonger-term leases, provide needed continuity when  dealing with local of ficials and landowners andhave more contracting authority than Air Force contracting. Your theater civil engineer staff can facil-itate CREST assistance. 2.21.  Mine/UXO Presence. Many bare bases have been esta blished through long-term governmentagreements with traditional treaty  or agreement allies/partners; the  bases were readied with peacetimeconstruction programs. AEF deployments within a theater's area of responsibility (AOR) must often relyon use of airfields or airports that have been ma de available on a short-term  basis and often may havebeen exposed to ethnic, sectarian, or regional violence. When this is the case, opening the airfield and thesurrounding airfield environment for base beddown usually becomes a much greater problem and danger-ous situation due to mine fields and UXOs. 2.21.1.  Air Force and other service EOD teams usually have to enter the location first and start clear-ing the runway and the areas adjacent to it, the taxiways and aprons. Initial forces can then land, off-load equipment and stay in any adjacent area that  has been cleared of mines and UXOs. However ,actual layout of the base, construction of outlying and nearby defensive fighting positions, positioningand erection of shelters and running of utilities becomes a slow process as EOD teams clear each areaone portion after another. This usually requires mine detection and safing or demolition and identifi-cation, as well as safing and disposal or demolition of UXOs. 2.21.2.  Mines or UXOs that have been rendered safe by in-place demolition will also require subse-quent leveling and grading of the  craters. For areas with many mines, additional equipment may berequired from Army, British, or combat engineers from  other capable countries with mine dozers/plows or flails. Again, additional site preparations may be required to recover the areas where plowshad to be used. 2.21.3.  With these basic precautions, beddown can proceed within cleared areas for erection of facil-ities and surface layout of utilities. However, burying utilities can be a very slow process. Mines andUXOs located below the surface (especially in areas subject to flooding with drifting soil/sand), couldexplode when hit or uncovered by tr enching for utilities. EOD teams ma y have to scan or sweep foradditional UXOs and mines directly along the pathways for utility trenching. 2.22.  Considerations for Joint Operations Beddowns. Do not assume that another service is preparingthe support plan or is planning to take on the base operating support responsibility. Do not assume that theAir Force or another service will be in charge when you arrive. Air Force and Army lessons learned frominitial AEF deployments to remote, joint service bases showed that the initial command structures at theselocations were often too fluid for anyone to be in  charge during the initial beddown operations, and theoverall command and control of th e location could change several  times from initial beddown throughsustainment. Changes in base missions cause extraordinary increases in personnel and the need for sup-port services and facilities. Unit deployment planners must work with theater civil engineers and plannersto identify locations that will be used for  major staging operations. During OEF, some bases expandedfrom an expected 300 persons to over 7,000 persons. AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006292.23.  Support Plans. When an airfield had no previous survey for beddown requirements, the first unitsin need to know what other units are coming so they can determine the general size and layout of the base.For sizing purposes only, base planners should consid er as a contingency scenario that unit departuresmay overlap with unit arrivals and that both may have to operate on the base for some time. They shouldalso take into account that  expedient sanitation facilities may have to be used  initially, which can createthe need for additional land area. Finally, joint service may also mean that partner nation military forcesare employed at the location besides just US Army , Navy or Marine units.  Beddown planners must begiven the full picture on who will be at the location and when they will serve. Ideally an expeditionary sitemapping-based theater CESP or AEF BSP would include a base layout, which would address all missionsand be coordinated by other  stakeholder service branches. This is rare. More frequently, the initial AEFcivil engineer force will arrive at a location and have to report to the interim, ranking AF officer (such asthe TALCE commander). This is because the initial forces from other services at joint service bases areoften combat forces, which do not have base construction resp onsibility. Careful consideration duringplanning must be given to servi ce munition operation/storage requirements because of their associatedexplosive safety quantity distance (ESQD) arcs which limit available beddown areas. 2.23.1.  When TPFDD based informat ion is used for initial beddow n planning and layout, developsupport plans and layouts to take into account all  the beddown resources that will be used that arecompatible. Until Air Force Harvest Falcon systems and Army Force Provider systems becomeinteroperable for utilities (either through changes in  the utility systems or c onversion kits), like sys-tems may have to be grouped with specific personnel (i.e., Army with Force Provider). Unless there isadequate room to separate services for independence of efforts, plan on siting in common groupingsas much as possible (to allow connection of compatible utility systems), such as billeting and supportservice areas, maintenance and industrial areas, flightline areas, medical facilities and separated muni-tions areas. If other services' engi neers or planners are present,  use their knowledge and skills whendeveloping the layout, as they should be more familiar with their service's requirements. Army engi-neers can be valuable when planning for sustainment, as many have an automated beddown program(i.e. Theater Construction Management System) that provides basic de signs and bills of material forvarious types of construction, facilities and standards. 2.23.2.  While Air Force units have ta ken some pressure for wanting to provide quality of life livingstandards and facilities too early in base development, other services have faced the problem of notidentifying early enough clearly defined living standards for  base camps and staging bases. Theatercommanders should have identified acceptable living standards to plan for during initial deployments. 2.23.3.  Many joint service bases are supposed to be purple suit operations with shared responsibilitiesfor base operations support. In other cases, one service may open the base and maintain responsibility,or take over the responsibility for all support. The TPFDD addresses the requirement for support of anairbase and/or base camp. In some  cases, it is essential that other  services provide or augment initialkey bare base skills, such as fire protection, bio-environmental, utilities (water and waste), power gen-eration and environmental (pest  management). When the TPFDD requires the Air Force to be sup -ported by these personnel early on in the deploymen t, AEF civil engineers and planners shouldcontact the other services’ units and coordinate arrival schedules to ensure  that the other services’engineers can be there as schedul ed in the TPFDD. Be aware that  often these engineering personnelwould not be mobilized early enough for initial support, since they typically arrive when their serviceaccepts responsibility for base operating support. There absence could delay beddown of facilities andutilities or cause crucial delays in overall beddown. 30AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006Figure 2.9.  MREs vs. Mobile Kitchen Trailer. 2.24.  Expeditionary Combat Support (formerly Base Operating Support). ECS includes the provi-sion of supplies, vehicle maintenance, civil engineering support, services support (including food service,billeting, laundry, mortuary affairs, recreation centers and fitness centers), communications, security andgeneral administrative support. During AEF deployments for OEF, it became evident that there was abasic difference in the ECS concept of operation between the Air Force and the Army. 2.24.1.  AEFs deploy as a wing (or a portion of a wi ng with groups and squadrons from other bases)and form an AEW. Air Force ECS is integral with the wing structure. 2.24.2.  The Army has combat engineers and support personnel to support mobile combat operations,but they do not perform the ECS function. The Army has various support battalions that provide sta-tionary base operating support, but most of these are reserves. For combined base camps/airfields ini-tially supported by the Air Force a nd partner nation engineers, Army  units often could not take overECS until all preparations were in place. 2.24.3.  Check deployment orders to en sure that theater planners have addressed base operating sup-port and transfer of responsibility. Start early on in the deployment to track and account for resourcesto ensure that equipment/assets can be reassigned during transfer of responsibility. In some cases, anAir Expeditionary Group may have to remain at the location to support Air Force personnel and mon-itor/control equipment/asset accounting. 2.25.  Command and Control Relationships. When the deployed location is  designated as a numberedAEW, whether or not the expeditionary civil engineer squadron is primarily from one base or is composedof numerous units or individuals, it is important that all Air Force civil engineers are formed together (andbillet together) as a unit. This t ype relationship may be  harder to enforce when civil engineer forcesinclude Air Force, Army/Navy/Marine (i.e., other service branches),  or international personnel assignedfor support of the airbase. The best policy is to integrate similar forces into one designated work-taskingunit, whether the unit is a blue, purple, or plaid suite operation, not withstanding any possible need to sep-arately billet by service/nation. AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 200631Chapter 3   PLANNING FOR BASE OPERATING AND SUPPORT FACILITIES 3.1.  Overview. The Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines each have differing standards for base OperatingSupport. This chapter establishes planning guidelines, authorizations and standards for contingency basesat various stages of development. Figure 3.1.  Bare Base Sighted Alongside Host Nation Facilities. 3.2.  Purpose. To provide definitions and st andards for facilities, utilities and personnel support withinforward operating locations, forward operating bases, main operations and intermediate staging area air-bases. 3.3.  Facility Standards for Base Camps. During the evolution of a con tingency airbase, infrastructureand facilities will progress from initial to semi-permanent construction standards depending on missionrequirements and operational duration. Definition and de scription of authorized end-state facility con-struction standards are listed in  Table 3.2., pages 3-4 through 3-6. The Component Commander ofCFACC has the authority to establish expeditionary airbases at any construction standard based on opera-tional requirements and resource availability. AF guidance on authorized facility requirements and stan-dards is listed later in this chapter (Expeditiona ry Airbase Development Matrix) and in AFH 32-1084,Facility Requirements. This guidance applies to al l base camps, regardless of the stage of development.The matrix clarifies the desired construction quality for each facility at various stages of development. Itis understood that meeting these standards will be a progressive effort. Theater and MAJCOM CE staffswill strive to meet the standards contained in this chapter as quickly as the operational, resource and coor-dination (programming, approval and funding for semi-permanent and permanent standards) situationallows. 3.4.  Force Protection and Safety. Antiterrorism force protection and p hysical security in the expedi-tionary environment present unique challenges to planners, engineers and security forces. The threat type,32AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006severity and desired level of protection are the primary considerations when selecting AT/FP and physicalsecurity measures. These considerations will be used to identify vulne rabilities, reduction measures andthe siting of facilities. In the expeditionary envi ronment, important security planning factors include:availability of existing facilities, types of structures, existing natural or man-made features, types andquantity of indigenous construction materials, avai lable real estate and ot her base infrastructure.Pre-existing buildings will be renovated to meet DOD, AF and CFACC force protection and security stan-dards. These standards will provide guidance for developing strategies to mitigate the effects of specificaggressor tactics, defined levels of protection and ef fects on building costs of  applying those measures.Specific force protection measures and planning considerations are detailed in Chapter 7 of this volume. 3.4.1.  UFC 4-010-01,  Design: DOD Minimum Antiterrorism Standards for Buildings, outlines thethreat level and construction requ irements for facilities in both expeditionary and permanent bases.Table 3.1. is extracted from UFC 4-010-01 to give the CE planner an idea of the required level of ATconstruction standards and the impli cations of the various standard s for expeditionary construction.These factors will allow the CE planner to adequately brief the combined forces commander or theaterplanner on ramifications of progr amming and funding for construction  at various levels. Ultimately,the component commander, with the guidance of his staff civil engineer, will be responsible for defin-ing construction standards for their various bases as outlined in Chapter 1 of this publication. 3.4.2.  Levels of protec tion are described in  Table 3.1., Table 3.2. and Table 3.3.. These standardsprovide a low level of pr otection for billeting and primary gathering buildings because of the higherconcentration of personnel and attractive nature of the target. The effects of utilization of various stan-dards of protection can be  mitigated by additional active and passive measures such as increasedstandoff distances, perimeter fencing, alarming etc.  The impact of increased AT standards results insignificant improvement to the facility and person nel survivability but comes at the expense ofincreased funding, beddown execution timelines and res ources. These must be balanced to meet theCC’s mission requirements. 3.5.  Authorized and Required Facilities. As part of the deployment  planning and base beddown pro-cess outlined in AFPAM 10-219 Volume 5, it is imperative to ensure that limited resources are applied toprioritized mission requirements. The bottom line during planning is that there will never be enough spaceand assets to make everyone happy and give them what they think they deserve. In light of this, it is up tothe civil engineer planners and  mission support group planners to ove rsee the planning board and mini-mize conflict. Table 3.2. provides some basic guidelines on facility authorization at different contingencylocations to better facilitate some of the facility utilization planning. AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 200633Table 3.1.  Levels of Protection – Expeditionary and Temporary Structures. Level of Protection Below AT Standards Very Low AT Standards Low AT Standards Medium AT Standards High AT Standards Potential Structural Damage Severely damaged.  Frame collapse/massive destruction.  Little left standing Heavily damaged.  Major portions of the structure will collapse (over 50%).  A significant percentage of secondary structural members will collapse (over 50%). Damaged – unrepairable.  Some section of the structure may collapse or lose structural capacity (10-20% of structure) Damaged – repairable.  Minor to major deformations of both structural members and non-structural elements.  Some secondary debris will be likely but the structure remains intact with collapse unlikely. Superficially damaged.  No permanent deformation to primary and secondary structural members or non-structural elements. Potential Injury Majority of personnel suffer fatalities. Majority of personnel suffer serious injury.  There are likely to be a limited number of fatalities (10-25%) Majority of personnel suffer significant injuries.  There may be few fatalities (<10%). Some minor injuries, but no fatalities are likely. Only superficial injuries are likely. Table 3.2.  Expeditionary Airbase Construction Standards in Theater.

Facility Construction Standards. Table 3.3. provides guidance on the authorized facility construc-tion standards as defined by mission duration and weapons systems requirements. Construction standardsare detailed in Chapter 2 of this volume. The component commander may authorize any constructionstandard for beddown and bare base  construction, as long as it conf orms to Air Force programming andfunding authorization and guidelines as listed in AFIs 32-1021, -1022, -1023 and Chapter 6 of this vol-ume. 3.6.1.  Billeting Standards. Initial billeting standards for all con tingency bases is utilization of hostnation facilities, BEAR or Force Provider tentage utilizing the pla nning factors listed later in thischapter for space requirements. Depending on mission requirements and airbase operational duration,housing may be improved to modular facilities or semi-permanent style dormitories. Theater level CEplanning staffs will dictate the level and speed  of billeting upgrades based on the CF ACC’s missionrequirements. It is critical that  the theater and contingency base engineers plan for a surge billeting46AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006capability to respond to changes in war plans and base mission requirements. To accommodate popu-lation surges/transients, expeditionary airbases will maintain the ability to house 110% of its total nor-mal population at all times. If the base is utilizing temporary or semi-permanent construction standardbillets (SEA huts, modulars, etc.) surge capacity may be accomplished through utilization of availableBEAR or Force Provider tentage. 3.6.2.  Rotary Wing Aviation Facilities. Helicopter landing and parking pads may initially be S tabi-lized Earth or AM-2 Matting to prevent foreign object damage (FOD). Landing/parking pads will beupgraded to concrete or asphalt  with adequate grounding rods an d tie-downs. Treat all soil in theimmediate area of the pads to reduce FOD. Pla ce HESCO bastions or similar materials around hotarming pads to minimize damage from accidental mi ssile discharge. At a minimum, outfit one heli-copter-landing pad on each base camp with landing lights for reduced visibility operations. 3.6.3.  Maintenance Facilities Planning Consider ations. The responsible component shall provideappropriate aircraft maintenance structures in accordance with the number/type of aircraft supported.Coordinate with theater or deploying Logistics/Maintenance planner for facility requirements. 3.6.4.  Medical Facilities Planning Considerations. Develop plans for health clinics, dental clinics andhospitals in coordination with the responsible component Health Facility Planning Office. Design andconstruct medical facilities in accordance with the responsible operational command’s standards. TheAir Force has developed multiple deployable medical treatment facilities (MTFs) to treat and evacu-ate casualties under all conditions. The Expeditionary Medical Support (EMEDS) system is composedof more than 170 equipment a nd personnel building block UTCs to  meet the spectrum of medicalresponse needs. EMEDS is deployed in expandable  components and its facilities range in size fromfour bed holding areas to 114-bed theater hospitals able to treat a population at risk of over 5000 per-sonnel. See Volume 5 of this pamphlet series for detailed civil engineer  support requirements forexpeditionary medical facilities. 3.6.5.  Transportation Maintenance Facilities. The responsible comp onent will design and constructvehicle maintenance facilities. The vehicle maintenance facilities will evolve as the base campmatures to support the mission. 3.6.5.1.  Maintenance Facilities. The facility should be equipped with environmental control unitsand electricity when the operational situation allows. 3.6.5.2.  Fuel Truck Parking. Secondary containment pads are required for fuel truck parking. Thecontainment pads will be equi pped with a collection sump an d grounding rods for parked fueltrucks. 3.6.6.  Hazardous Waste Accumulation Points. Construct hazardous waste accumulation points IAWthe Overseas Environmental Baseline Guidance Document (OEBGD). Responsible Component Com-manders may authorize additional ac cumulation points as required.  Each base will designate a baseengineer responsible for all hazardous material management and hazardous waste collection and dis-posal. 3.6.7.  Solid Waste Disposal. Solid Waste Disposal will be in accordance with the OEBGD. Theresponsible component will authorize the environmentally-appropriate method of disposal of solidwaste such as use of incineration or use of landfills. 3.6.8.  Fuel Storage. Above ground fuel tanks are authorized for the storage of bulk fuels at long termcamps. When fuel bladders are necessary, site them according to the OEBGD. AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006473.6.9.  Munitions Storage Areas (MSA). Construct MSA in accordance with the responsible compo-nent’s guidance. Munitions storage areas will have containment berms, a fenced and lighted perimeter,graveled access roads and lightning protection. Store ammunition in protective structures that are notin contact with the ground (i.e. on wooden pallets or on concrete foundations). 3.6.10.  Kennels. Where military working dogs are authorized for an operation, the responsible com-ponent will provide kennel facilities to sustain the operation. Kennel facilities will evolve as the basecamp matures to include environmental controls, electrical service and exercise yard. 3.6.11.  Mortuary Affairs. Morgues will be in accordance with the standards in Joint Publication 4-06,Joint Tactics, Techniques and Procedures for Mortuary Affairs in Joint Operations. Regardless of thetype of base camp, privacy screens will be installed around the entire morgue facility. 3.6.12.  Distinguished visitor (DV) and guest quarters. Main operations and logistics hub base campswill have DV and guest quarters. 3.7.  Utilities. Design utility systems based on current applicable military handbooks, technical manualsand guidance. Refer to Attachment 3 (Base Camp Development Matrix) for the recommended facilitiesfor each level of base camp development. 3.8.  Electric Power.  3.8.1.  Electrical Grid Development. As the base camp matures, and where economically supportableand practicable, connect base camp power grids to commercial power. Smaller or remote base campsthat cannot be economically connected to a commercial power grid should install central power plantswith the capacity to support 12 5% of the peak electrical  demand in accordance with componentrequirements. During planning phase, give careful consideration to desired electrical system end-stateas outlined in the utilities portion of Attachment 3 (paragraph A3.36.1.4.). 3.8.2.  When the operational situation does not allow a  central power plant, then the base camp willuse distributed generators of sufficient capacity to support peak electrical demand loads in accordancewith component requirements. Backup generators should be installed within the base camp. Theplacement, types and numbers will be dependent upon the operational situation. 3.8.3.  Considerations for Electrical Grid/Load Planning. In the planning phase for the base camp elec-trical grid, the electrical load for the following numbers and types of equipment must be calculated toensure an adequate electrical power supply/grid is constructed: 3.8.3.1.  Environmental Control Units (Heating/Air Conditioning). 3.8.3.2.  Communications and Automation Equipmen t. Communications equipment, computersand airfield control measures are critical for electrical load  calculation. Ensure planning encom-passes charging requirements for battery operated computers and computer base equipment. 3.8.3.3.  Dining Facility Electrical Equipment. Refer to theater/base Services planner for detailedload information. 3.8.3.4.  Billeting. Deployed AF  personnel carry a great deal of  electronic equipment not origi-nally planned for under the BEAR deployment concept. It is common for senior enlisted personneland officers to deploy with pers onal laptops and other electronic equipment. Ensure these aretaken into consideration when outlining electric al requirements. During upgrades, it has becomecommon practice to include small refrigerators, television, VCR/DVD players, game consoles and48AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006computers even in expeditionary tent city environments. The CE planner must be prepared for thislevel of electrical load as soon as resources and mission effectiveness allow. 3.8.4.  Maintenance Facilities. 3.8.5.  Force Protection Measures (Exterior Lighting/Electrified Fencing). 3.8.6.  Morale, Welfare and Recreation (MWR) Activity Devices and  Lighting. Tent cities normallyhave a central MWR tent that  is comprised of television/theater equipment, gaming consoles,increased computer equipment and other functions. Coordination with the theater/base theater plannerwill enable the CE planner to ad equately cover the electrical needs and incremental growth of thesefacilities during base upgrades. 3.8.7.  Civilian Contract Power. Depending on the operational situation, civilian contracts can be usedto procure, operate and maintain electrical power as the base  camp passes beyond the Expeditionaryand Initial phases of development. 3.9.  Environmental Control (Heating/Air Conditioning). As the base camp matu res, the responsiblecomponent will provide environmental control units to supported facilities/units based on operational andenvironmental needs. The type, method and standard of environmental control will be determined by thefollowing criteria: 3.9.1.  Operational situation. 3.9.2.  Climate. During OEF numerous northern expediti onary bases in the theater of operation weredelivered pallets of ECUS in the  late fall months that  were unable to produce the heating required(standard Harvest ECUs utilized a heat strip that was only functional to 25 degrees Fahrenheit) whilemore southern bases went without, even though the daily temperatures were still exceeding 90 degreesFahrenheit. The CE planner must understand the cap abilities and limitations of equipment requestedto ensure our limited assets are sourced for the proper location. 3.9.3.  Type/function of facility/base camp. 3.9.4.  Maturity of facility/base camp. Unless extreme climactic conditions or equipment requirementsarise, it does not make sense to  waste limited airlift to deploy envi ronmental control units to InitialStandard expeditionary bases (<90 days). 3.9.5.  Base camps will utili ze existing installed environmental c ontrol systems if economically andenvironmentally feasible. 3.9.6.  The following priority list fo r deployment of environmental control units is provided to assistCE planners in doling out these assets. This list serves as a guideline for both theater planners execut-ing dozens of beddowns or the ba se planner prioritizing on ground  assets for installation. ECUsshould be installed in the following priority: 3.9.6.1.  Command/Control/Communications and Automation facilities. 3.9.6.2.  Medical facilities. 3.9.6.3.  Billeting. 3.9.6.4.  Dining facilities. 3.9.6.5.  Dog kennels. AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 20063.9.6.6.  MWR facilities. 3.10.  Potable Water Recommendations.  493.10.1.  Base Engineers should tie into local municipalities where it is economically feasible, and con-ditions meet health and force pr otection standards. The installation of a water purification stationshould be considered during the initial planning for the base camp and be part of the start up costs forthe base camp. 3.10.2.  Installation of wells for pot able water is recommended. A  minimum of two wells per camp,one primary and one back up, within the boundaries of the base camp are recommended. Planning willinclude the drilling of all wells at the same time to reduce mobilization costs. If economically feasible,plan and install water storage distribution systems. Additional wells may be drilled  within the basecamp boundaries, if the situation allows, if additional capacity is required. 3.10.3.  Well-drilling should be contracted through civilian markets where it is economically feasibleand conditions meet force protec tion requirements. RED HORSE units or Army Combat Engineershave well-drilling capabilities that will need to be requested, sourced and prioritized through the the-ater engineering planning function. 3.10.4.  Transported or bottled water should be used only during the  early stages of a contingencyoperation and should be used as a long-term potab le water source only if no alternate sources areavailable. One major lesson learne d by planners is that bottled water places a huge burden on thelogistics procurement and theater ai rlift planners. CE planners need  to be aware that the decision toutilize bottled water will re sult in the loss of daily  airlift for other equipment and resources if localsuppliers cannot be located and certified to US standards. 3.11.  Waste Treatment Plant. The initial assessment for a base camp should plan for wastewater treat-ment based on a minimum of 110% projected size of the camp to include coalition forces and local nation-als. Coordinate with local contracting and environmental offices to determine if connection to a municipalwastewater treatment plant is economically feasible and environmentally sound. Containerized wastewa-ter treatment plants are available  through civilian contracts and should  be considered when appropriateand connection to municipal  plants is not allowed. Expeditionary ba ses in Northern Iraq were able tosource and install a containerized wastewater treatment for under $700,000 in 60 days. 3.12.  Personnel Support. Upgrade personnel support facilities to increase support services and providea safer working environment. The recommended levels of support (as listed in Attachment 3, Base CampDevelopment Matrix) are to apply to all base camps. The level  of personnel support will evolve as thebase camp matures and operational requirements change. 3.12.1.  Dining Facilities. The  dining facility may change as the  base matures. The long term diningfacility will have electric lighting, environmental control units as operationally feasible and adequateelectrical connections. If civilian contractors are used, establish an occupational medicine program forhealth screening. Ensure that local national ki tchen staff is provided adequate space for cleaning,latrine and changing areas. 3.12.2.  Each base camp will have a nondenominationa l religious support facility, sized according tothe base population. The structure, as operationally feasible, will have electrical lighting, environmen-tal control units and fixed electrical connections. The responsible base commander will provide ade-50AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006quate office space for chaplains to conduct privileged communications, adequate storage space andside areas for private devotions. Coordination with  theater/base chaplain planner will further  definetheir requirement. 3.12.3.  Fire Protection. The  responsible component commander will provide Fire and Emer gencyResponse Services IAW DODI 6055.6 and National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 403, Stan-dard for Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting Services at Airports. 3.13.  Planned Upgrades. The basic requirement to  support mission full operational capability (FOC)within a set timeline determines  the AEF facility beddown timeli nes. Meeting the FOC and beddowntimelines (as well as providing an acceptable level of force protection, readiness capabilities, fire protec-tion and critical support facilities ) drives TPFDD re-engineering and  UTC restructuring. AEF bare basesupport must be lighter, leaner and faster. The following matrix is provided to assist CE and contingencyairbase planners to provide initial requirements for minimum operations. Upgrades from initial to tempo-rary standards should be planned and implemented as soon as mission and resources allow. 3.14.  Manpower Utilization and Task Assignment. CE planners need to review anticipated deploy-ment duration and mission requirements to determine the best utiliz ation of limited active duty, AFRESand ANG civil engineer personnel to ensure that the areas where they are deployed and utilized are appro-priate for blue suit operations. Table 3.5. lists some standard contingency tasks and provides general guid-ance for potential task execution resources to limit deployed man-days for CE personnel. Personnel Tasking EXPEDI-TIONARY < 90 Days Solid Waste  Field Incinerator or landfill Field Incinerator or landfill Medical Waste Field Incinerator Field Incinerator Hazardous Waste Facility Engineers Removal from Site to central collection location Military Engineer Units Removal from theater IAW OEBGD Field Incinerator or landfill or civilian contract removal and disposal Incinerator/Civilian Contract removal and disposal Civilian Contract removal and disposal Field Incinerator or landfill or civilian contract removal and disposal Incinerator/Civilian Contract removal and disposal Civilian Contract removal and disposal Field Incinerator or landfill or civilian contract removal and disposal Incinerator/Civilian Contract removal and disposal Civilian Contract removal and disposal Military units transferring to Civilian Contracts Civilian Fire Fighters Civilian Contract AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 200651Table 3.5.

BEAR 150 (Swift BEAR) Assets. 3.16.  Army Force Provider Resources. Force Provider is the Army’s base camp support system, similarto the Air Force BEAR system. Force Provider was de veloped in response to lessons learned from the1991 Gulf War. During Operation Desert Storm the Army realized that its base beddown and operatingsupport facilities contained only rudimentary messing and hygiene f acilities and actually hampered mis-sion accomplishment and troop morale. Figure 3.4.  US Army Force Provider Set. 3.16.1.  The Force Provider (FP) mission is to give frontline soldiers a respite from the rigors of duty.Each Force Provider Company consists of six platoons  which can support 550  soldiers separately.Combining all six modules allows support for 3,300 soldiers. The modules can operate as stand-alonebeddown or as a modular and scalable tent city to  support as large a deployment as assets are avail-able. Each 550+ module provides the following: 54AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 20063.16.1.1.  Climate controlled billeting for 600 personnel (550 soldiers and 50 FP maintainers). 3.16.1.2.

Overview:  The provision of water, electricity and removal and treatment of wastewater are criticalto the success of deployed military operations and AF CE mission requirements. This chapter will outlinesome general utility issues. Greater detail on planning and installing de ployed utility systems is outlinedin AFPAM 10-219 Volume 5 and AFH 10-222, Volume 1. 4.2.  Problems and Solutions. Recent bare base operations during OAF, OEF and OIF have highlighteda number of utility limitations and challenges faced by deployed expeditionary engineering units. Theaterand unit level engineer planners and leadership can alleviate many of these problems by understanding thecause and effects of these limitations. Figure 4.1.  Typical BEAR Utility Assets. 4.3.  Potable Water. During Operations Southern and Northe rn Watch deployed USAF personnel andbase camp operations used bottled water as the primary source of potable water for personal consumption.This evolution from production-based potable water supplies resulted from very liberal assistance-in-kind(AIK) agreements between the Gulf States of Kuwait, Turkey and Saudi Arabia and Air Force personneloperating within the theater. In these agreements, the host nation agreed to supply numerous consumableresources to include potable water at no char ge to the US government. As  personnel rotated through theCENTAF AOR, bottled water became  part of the understood deploya ble concept of operations. Thisdependency upon bottled water caused a number of problems during OEF and OIF. AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006594.3.1.  Water supply for the personnel  at an OEF base in Afghanista n was provided by bottled waterflown in from central supply points in Qata r and Kuwait. Two months into the mission with over1,000 personnel on the ground, the CE water shop was  treating 15,000 gallons of city water per day.The base utilized the treated water for laundry, dining, cleaning and hygiene requirements but wouldnot utilize it for personal consumption. The treated city water was rated safe by the base Bioenviron-mental Engineer yet the base was still flying in roughly 10,000 bottles of water per day to support basepersonnel. This consumed critical airflow for other mission assets since water was always prioritizedat the top position for intra-theater airlift. 4.3.2.  While experiencing shortfalls in engineering heavy equipment, maintenance supplies and qual-ity of life improvements, the base was losing approximately two C-130 flights per day to the mindsetthat AF personnel must drink bottled water. Since this mindset was prevalent at over 17 expeditionarybases in the AOR it had a significant effect on available airlift. Mission requirements eventually led tomany bases, such as Bagram, Kanda har, and Jacobabad to switch  over to ROWPU treated water forconsumption when the base population surged beyond the AF’s ability to purchase, marshal and shipenough bottled water to support base populations in remote areas. 4.3.3.  Theater engineering planners need to be ready to advocate for the judicious use of bottled waterfor initial operations and conversion to other sources as quickly as possible to increase overall missioneffectiveness. 4.4.  Latrine/Sanitation Facilities. Poor sanitation and hygiene has significantly impacted military cam-paigns throughout history. Figure 4.4 shows examples of latrine facilities used by Air Force expeditionaryforces during the OAF, OEF and OIF. Many of the austere and initial standard facilities were utilized forextended periods while theater level planners attempted to source and transport Harvest Falcon or ForceProvider assets to alleviate conditions that did not meet minimum AF operating and hygiene standards. Figure 4.2.  Expeditionary Latrines during Contingency Operations. 4.4.1.  In this day and age of modern technology, airlift and continued improvements in bare base assettechnologies, AF expeditionary engineers can still expect to be faced with a wide-range of sanitationand latrine options while bedding down US and coalition troops. Numerous bare base beddowns dur-ing OAF, OEF and OIF required USAF engineers to construct field expedient latrines, urine trenches,latrines with burnout pots and other creative solutions to handle a very real sanitation problem. 60AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 20064.4.1.1.  Base engineers need to ensure that they focus on completing basic expedient latrine andsanitation construction techniques during field  exercises, and ensure personnel understand theimportance of planning for and marking the location of waste collection areas, slit trench locationsand other waste disposal areas to ensure future excavation does not expose these areas. 4.4.1.2.  Shower Facilities. Although very important to hygiene,  sanitation and quality of life,shower facilities do not represent the critical requirement that latrines do. Recent operations haveshown that shower/shave kits will be bumped by higher priority assets for daily intra-theater air-lift. Deploying AF engineers should plan for the requirement to construct a field expedient showerfacility with limited Class IV material available on the local market. If showers are a high priorityof your deploying team, the engineers need to pack for it. 4.4.2.  Deployed units often experienced host nation (HN) infrastructure limitations when attemptingto expand base facilities for new missions and the associated infrastructure required: sewage treatmentand gray water disposal, solid  waste management programs. These types of limitations are greatlyimproved where the US and HN force have created a favorable political climate that creates opportu-nities for service contracts, land leases and utility supplies. The CE planner must take local economy,political relations and other outsid e influences into consideration when trying to solve the problem.Normal deployment systems/methods for sewage treatment and waste disposal may not be possiblewhen an existing airfield is used for an AEF deployment. Surrounding populations and structures maysimply prevent some expansions and existing utility systems may already be overtaxed or incapable ofhandling the additional load from a small military city dropping in on their doorstep. 4.4.3.  Deployment planning may have to consider use of purchased or leased package treatments sys-tems, construction of intermediate holding tanks to allow storage of sewage and wastewater forremoval to a more remote treatment  site and construction, repairs and upgrades to an existing utilitysystem before tying into it. AF CAP (or other contract augmentation programs) may be required toprovide resources and labor or RED HORSE may be  required to construct large tanks or bury pipe-lines. 4.5.  Electrical Development: Development of electrical requirements, upgrades and planning factorscan be found in AFPAM 10-219 Volume 5. 4.6.  Conclusion. Air Force engineers, planners and deployed personnel need to address sanitation andhygiene requirements early in the planning and beddown process. Silver Flag and CE training focuses onthe importance of this, yet we often still fall short in real world deployments. Historically during deploy-ments, more personnel require medical assistance due  to sanitation related illnesses than due to combatinjury. AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 200661Chapter 5   SECURITY AND FORCE PROTECTION DEVELOPMENT 5.1.  Overview. Security and protection of Air Force assets  in an expeditionary location is of criticalimportance to all organizations on the base. Although the Security Forces Commander operates the baseForce Protection plan, it cannot be a ccomplished without active participation of CE planners and crafts-men. AEF planners should have mo re information/intelligence on location threats when planning fordeployments to austere locations when compared to s tandard bare bases. Austere, forward locations areusually much closer to battle areas or areas of heightened terrorist threat. Units that deploy will have muchmore to consider when they arrive on station and some of  their initial actions may include verifying thethreat situation rather than starting site layout. Consider the following subjects when you deploy to higherthreat areas. Figure 5.1.  Security Forces Providing Perimeter Security. 5.2.  Force Protection Planning. For civil engineers, force protection roles and responsibilities have var-ied greatly since 1950. 5.2.1.  During the Cold War, the Air Force CONOPS was to operate from established main operatingbases with hardened shelters and facilities, as we ll as numerous buildings with chemical overprotec-tion. Army personnel surrounded these bases for ground defense and air defense with Patriot batteries.Depending on the theater, the threat ranged from attack by enemy special operations forces and sabo-teurs, larges scale air and ground attac ks and conventional and chemical missile and rocket a ttacks.Security force protection ranged from fortified bunkers, robust perimeter security and alarmed facilityand base access. 5.2.2.  During Operation Desert Storm the Air Force was able to activate some bases with Royal SaudiAir Force (RSAF) hardened facilities and chemi cal protection. The majority of Air Force operationswere conducted from bare  base, expeditionary airfields with Ha rvest Falcon systems or temporaryshelters, which were not chemically protected. Ar my forces and resources were still utilized to pro-vide ground defense and anti-aircraft/anti-missile  air defenses for AF bases. Rudimentary facilityhardening was accomplished with sa ndbags, concrete barriers and  various constructed revetments.Due to air and naval superiority, the major threat became chemical and biological attacks by missilesand terrorists, as well as conventional attacks by terrorists. Enemy special force units and teams were62AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006still a threat, but they had limited long-range capability to attack most bare bases. AF Security Forcespersonnel created force protection plans based on multiple fighting positions, roving patrols andmobile alarm systems. Chemical, biological and radiological detection was still relatively rudimentaryutilizing passive monitoring systems (M-8/M-9 tape) and often fell to Re adiness teams that wereill-equipped, lacked the adequate  situation intelligence and resources to adequately protect in whatcould have been a significantly contaminated environment. Figure 5.2.  PSAB Airbase (Before and After Buildup). 5.2.3.  Recent AEF deployments have relied on Harvest Eagle and Harvest Falcon assets, along withArmy Force Provider assets. Revetments have ranged from expedient sandbag to Concertainer sys-tems. Weapon threats tend to be  grenades, mortars, mines, rockets and missiles; shoulder firedanti-aircraft missiles and small ca nnons. While the threat is usually from explosives, there is thechance that chemical or biological agents could be used in war heads or even in ground dispersaldevices. Force protection is a major concern when there is a high probability of terrorist, saboteur, orinsurgent attacks, especially when the planned b are base airfield is at an existing commercial airportnear a town. When airfields are surrounded by populated areas, it fo rces in- and outbound aircraft tofly over towns and there is a greater threat of a successful shoot down of coalition aircraft. 5.2.3.1.  Force protection plans for expeditionary airbases (EAB) of this type should consider theuse of defensive fighting  positions, roving patrols, remote area detection alarms and other mea-sures to secure the flightline and the surrounding area to the greatest extent possible. 5.2.3.2.  Large frame aircraft used for troop rotation and resupply are easier and more inviting tar-gets to enemy forces and their protection places an  even greater strain on our security forces per-sonnel. Fighting positions must be used along with portable  alarm systems and detection fields.Protective measures and patrols must be extended as far past the runway clear zones as possible toprevent targeting of the slower, heavier aircraft on approach and take off. AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 200663Figure 5.3.  Expeditionary Airbase in Afghanistan. 5.2.4.  Civil Engineer and Security Force pla nners must coordinate force protection requirements,help establish protection zones, reinforce fighting positions, clear or establish obstacles and hardenthe perimeter in some locations  to ensure maximum utilization of resources. Beddown and planningshould take into account the force protection needs at their inception to prevent problems during exe-cution. It may be necessary to  construct berms and revetments arou nd critical assets and to bury orcover utilities. 5.2.5.  AEF deployments for OEF e xperienced planned and unplanned growth, which required addi-tional land and resources. Every change that increases the base footprint usually requires changes andextensions to force protection measures. Some areas with exposed fuel transfer pipelines may have tobe buried or placed between  berms or shallow trench es to provide additional protection. The sameholds true for utility lines. While electrical cables should normally be buried, if host nations prohibitburying or the ground surface is solid rock, then you should plan to berm and cover or bring in soil andcover these utilities (except at road crossings where these utilities should always be buried). 5.2.6.  When there is a higher risk of terrorist attacks or sabotage , protection of water transfer linesbecomes a concern. In the past, a major concern related to chemical attacks has been the introductionof agents into a municipa l water supply used by de ployed forces. However, there is also a threat towater produced by ROWPUs and stored in tanks. Du e to the ready availability of waterline hot-tap-ping tools, PVC or soft/ductile water transfer pipes can be tapped under pressure within minutes. Thena chemical poison or bi ological agent could be introduced  with a hand pump. Provide planningassumptions for protective measures such as roving patrols and/or burying the lines, especially for anyareas that are not readily observable. 5.2.7.  To meet the threat of an airborne chemical attack, planning should also consider whether addi-tional areas of the base will have to be cleared to create saf e areas for contamination control ar eas(CCA). Planners should consider possible approach/departure routes for the base and CCAs based onthe topography and prevailing winds. Planners should understand that open areas, which can be usedas potential CCAs, may f urther limit the available la nd on a base. If this is the case, notify theater64AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006planners that contingency real estate support teams (CREST) or theater contracting officers may haveto take action to lease additional land prior to deployment. 5.3.  Classification of Threats. CE planners need to be able to characterize and define the various threatsfaced in an expeditionary location to greater partner with the force protection planning group at both thetheater and base level. The Air Force has developed a matrix to define the varying levels and threats posedto an expeditionary airbase (Table 5.1. and Table 5.2.). Greater detail on these and other potential NBCCthreats may be found in AFMAN 10-2602 Chapter 2, Sections 2-4 through 2-12. Table 5.1.  EAF Airbase Threat Matrix. Low Intensity               EAF Threat Level I Irregular forces             Terrorists                      Penetrating threats Ground Air Chemical/ Biological Conventional Airdropped munitions Contamination of food & water Information, Command & Control Physical and virtual attack on IT systems, networks and connectivity Table 5.2.  Airbase Defense Threat Levels. Medium Intensity         EAF Threat Level II Military Special Ops      Sabotage                         Standoff/Long range munitions threat Enemy offensive counter-air operations Localized Chemical Warfare (CW) agent contamination Disruption of reach back capability and computer connectivity (SIPR and NIPR) High Intensity         EAF Threat Level III Regular Infantry Assault Theater Ballistic Missile (e.g. SCUDs) Base wide CW contamination Radio Frequency Weapons      Hack of the Network    Disabling of Networks                  Threat Level I II III Example Response Agents, Saboteurs, sympathizers, terrorists  Airbase, wing and unit self-defense and force Small tactical units, unconventional warfare forces, guerilla groups Large conventional tactical forces, to include airborne, heliborne and major air operations protection measures Airbase, wing and unit self-defense force protection measures with supporting fire from larger combat units Requires support of tactical size combat forces dependent upon threat 5.3.1.  Low-intensity ground  threats include utilization of gueri lla style tactics by conventional ornon-conventional military forces (terrorists, insurgents or military) to pene trate base perimeters anddisrupt operations or cause loss of AF personnel or resources. The best defense against a low intensityground threat is utilization of a large and mobile security forces presence to provide monitoring of thebase perimeter and controlling base access. Through a number of AF Battle Lab initiatives, the AF hasAFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 200665developed a number of electronic  upgrades to equip the roving patr ols and augment perimeter secu-rity. These initiatives include, bu t are not limited to, th e Tactical Automated Surveillance System,night vision technology, perimeter fence movement detectors, perimeter cameras with central controland monitoring, and lighter armored vehicles and body armor. The theater and base SF Force Protec-tion Cell will be able to provide additional information to the CE planner regarding equipment in useand required CE support of construction and infrastructure to support FP initiatives. Figure 5.4.  Infrared Sensor Security System Installed on Base Perimeter. 5.3.2.  Medium-intensity ground  threat includes the utilization of enemy Special Operations Forces(SOF), paramilitary, specialized terrorist organizations that attempt base penetrations and operationsdisruption through direct attack or  standoff weaponry (mortars, rockets, rocket propelled grenades)launched from outside the base perimeter. This type of threat is very difficult to defend against sincethe primary methodology is to attack from beyond the perimeter fence where US forces may or maynot have authority to engage. Current procedures  require the base to work closely with host nationsecurity and military agencies to  provide beyond-the-fence surveillance and around the base (1,200foot desired) standoff, clear zone to minimize the impact of standoff weapons. CE personnel may becalled upon to erect counter-mobility berms, install concrete barriers and assist with the constructionof over watch positions and towers. The AF Force  Protection Battle Lab is looking into the potentialof fielding other assets to enable the SF personnel to better counter this threat. Contact you base forceprotection cell for information. 66AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006Figure 5.5.  Surveillance from Over Watch Tower. 5.3.3.  High-intensity ground threats are large scale, organized terrorist or enemy military forces (nor-mally brigade size or larger) attacks on an airbase. While low and medium intensity ground threats arethe responsibility of the  assigned base personnel, high-intensity threats will normally require thedeployment of additional forces to counter the threat. Baghdad International Airport during OperationIraqi Freedom was a high-intensity threat area that evolved into a medium thre at area. The AF wascollocated with an Army brigade to provide greater security and alleviate the threat. 5.3.4.  Low-intensity air threats are found in slow-moving unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) or suicideremote controlled aerial bombs (small remote controlled airplanes, rockets etc). When these are pairedwith GPS guidance systems, they  become especially lethal. Th ese UAV delivery systems can bearmed with a series of sub-muni tions, cluster bombs and conventional weapons, chemical/biologicalsystems that pose a serious threat to successful mission and airbase operations. Base planners shouldstrive to increase intelligence collection and coordination, SF interaction with air traffic control (hostnation and coalition). Base CE and SF need to have an adequate bunker and emergency alarm plan tocounter the potential impact of this type of weaponry. 5.3.5.  Medium-intensity air threat covers the realm of standard military or  terrorist aerial bombingoperations. In this type of environment, base CE and SF need to  have an adequate bunker and emer-gency alarm plan to counter the potential impact of this type of  attack. Current AF doctrine requiresthe AF to establish and maintain theater air superiority to counter this level of threat. 5.3.6.  High-intensity air threat en compasses theater ballistic missiles (SCUDS, intermediate rangeballistic missiles, etc.). The majority of enemies who will possess  this technology will be severelyhampered by poor guidance and limited stocks. Th e base should be prepar ed to defend against andsurvive lucky hits of conventional  or NBC warheads. The base CE a nd SF need to have an adequatebunker and emergency reaction plan to counter the potential impact of this threat. 5.3.7.  Low-intensity NBC threats encompass the potential of chemical or biological contamination ofbase water and food suppli es in an effort to sicken or kill the base population and disrupt missionoperation. Current AF operations utilize vaccinations, antibiotics, preventative health maintenance tocounter the effects of contamination. Bases should maintain an emergency supply of bottled water andmeals-ready-to-eat (MREs) as a backup in the event of contamination. Base food and water stocks canAFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 200667be resupplied within a matter of days so stockpiles do not need to be extensive. Base CE water produc-tion specialists and Biomedical Engineering personnel are responsible for continual testing of the basewater source. 5.3.8.  Medium-intensity NBC threats are defined as the localized release of NBC warfare agents withthe intent to immobilize, destroy or degrade US  operations. Localized release means the attack con-taminates parts of a base but falls short of af fecting the entire airbase,  resulting in the currentsplit-mission oriented personal protection (MOPP) concept of operations at AF bases worldwide. Asthe primary resource for readiness reporting the CE planners must relay heavily on the expertise andexperience found in the CE Readin ess Flights to alleviate this th reat. Intelligence, remote sensors,emergency response planning and adequate personnel bunkers will assist in minimizing the impact ofthis threat. 5.3.9.  High-intensity NBC threats are defined as an att ack that causes base wide contamination byNBC agents. As the primary resource for readines s reporting the CE planners  must relay heavily onthe expertise and experience found in the CE Readin ess Flights to alleviate this threat. I ntelligence,remote sensors, emergency response planning and adequate personnel bunkers will assist in minimiz-ing the impact of this threat. 5.3.10.  Low-intensity command an d control/intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C2ISR)threats are physical attacks on information, C2 and communications systems infrastructure. To defendagainst this, CE, Communications and SF planners need to ensure that key nodes, distribution centersand relays are installed in the most secure method available. Host nation coordination may be requiredfor underground installation. 5.3.11.  Medium-intensity C2ISR threats are defined as attacks to deny expeditionary forces access toreach back data and planning capabilities, connectivity to higher headquarters, intelligence organiza-tions, surveillance, and hacking of US government computer systems by insurgent forces. 5.3.12.  High-intensity C2ISR threats  are defined as the disruption or  destruction of C2ISR systemsthrough the utilization of electrical or radio waves. 5.4.  Security Forces Base Defense CONOPS. Engineers need to understand the defensive CONOPS ofthe AF Security Forces to  better support physical security requirements. The primary item for AF CEplanners to understand is that AF SF CONOPS dictate that the AF will be responsible for the tactical areaof responsibility (TAOR) and perimeter fence in, while security of the area outside of the base will fall toother agencies. The following postures are included in AFPD 31-3, Air Base Defense. 5.4.1.  During periods of low or mid-level threats (Levels I, II and III), airbase defense forces are pri-marily responsible for protecting the force from  attackers attempting close attack by penetratingforces and from standoff attack within the TAOR. The TAOR is the area, which the defense forcecommander can control through organic heavy/light weapons fire. The Air Force component willensure adequate support is available from the othe r joint components, host  nation, coalition, alliedforces, and civilian authorities to meet surveillance and denial needs, such as for the stand-of f threatbeyond the capabilities of the Air Force. 5.4.2.  During periods of high-level threat (Level III), airbase defense forces rely on a tactical combatforce (TCF) comprised of other US service components, allied, coalition, or host-nation forces toensure the survivability of airbases. 68AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 20065.4.3.  Outside the airbase TAOR, US Army, USMC, host nation military forces, or civilian lawenforcement agencies will have responsibility for security requirements. 5.4.4.  US, host-nation,  coalition, and civilian law enforcement/security forces will be incorporatedinto airbase defense planning and operations to the fullest extent possible. 5.5.  Force Protection and Safety. Antiterrorism force protection and p hysical security in the expedi-tionary environment present unique challenges to planners, engineers and security forces. The threat type,severity, and desired level of protection are the primary considerations when selecting AT/FP and physicalsecurity measures. These considerations will be used to identify vul nerabilities, reduction measures, andthe siting of facilities. In the expeditionary envi ronment, important security planning factors include:availability of existing facilities, types of structures, existing natural or man-made features, types andquantity of indigenous construction materials, available real estate, and othe r base infrastructure.Pre-existing buildings will be renovated to meet DOD, AF , and CFACC force protection and securitystandards. These standards will provide guidance to design strategies for mitigating the effects of specificaggressor tactics, defined levels of protection, and effects on building costs of applying those measures.Some specific force protection measures are as follows. 5.5.1.  Perimeter. Chain link or concertina fences will be employed on the camp perimeter. Wheneverpossible, berms and sniper screens  will be used to bloc k direct visual access  from outside the baseperimeter. Lighted gravel perimeter roads should be installed insi de the perimeter berm. Surveys toassess alternate access routes should be completed with focus on culverts underneath the perimeterfence. Culverts should be caged, or otherwise blocked to prevent personnel entry. 5.5.2.  Gates. Main gates with covered inspection ar eas are authorized if required by the operationalsituation. Barriers will be built to enable the blockage of large vehicles. Gate Guard Shacks should beequipped with lighting and environmental control units. Tilt bar and swing gates are authorized. Placeweapons clearing barrels inside the gates. 5.5.3.  Primary Gathering Facilities.  Construct barriers to minimiz e car bomb threats. Use HESCObastions, Jersey barriers, or other methods capable of stopping a car or truck. Fence the air condition-ing intakes to reduce the terrorist threat of introducing gas into duct systems. 5.5.4.  Water Sources. Water plants, wells, storage tanks, and bladders will be  fenced if a threat tothese facilities exists. 5.6.  Minimum Force Protection Design Standards. The most cost-effective solution for mitigating theeffects of an attack is generally to provide distance between facilities and any explosions that might occur.Unified Facilities Criteria 4-010-01 provides planning standards for expeditionary and temporary struc-tures, including minimum antiterrorism standards for expeditionary and temporary structures. As is thecase for fixed facilities, the type and severity of the  threat along with the desired level of protection willbe the primary considerations in the selection of the anti-terrorism force protection and physical securitymeasures. These considerations will affect decisions on various issues  such as the types of vulnerabilityreduction measures and the physical layout of facilities, facility groups and infrastructure. Important fac-tors in planning security measures  in the expeditionary environment  include the availability of existingfacilities, the type of structures in which people live and work, existing natura l or man-made features,type and quantity of indigenous construction materials,  available real estate an d layout of utilities andother base infrastructure. The stan dards in UFC 4-010-01 fo r minimum standoff distances apply to allAFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 200669new and existing expeditionary and  temporary structures and is more in depth and has precedence overguidance outlined in this pamphlet. 5.6.1.  Facility Access. 5.6.1.1.  Select sites away from public roads or other uncontrolled areas. 5.6.1.2.  Maximize use of natural or  man-made features to obscu re vision from potential threatvantage points. 5.6.1.3.  Limit vehicle approach speeds. 5.6.1.4.  Minimize vehicle access points. 5.6.1.5.  Provide an entry control point with a well defined holding area for unauthorized vehiclesand vehicles being searched. The holding area should be outside of prescribed minimum standoffdistance. 5.6.1.6.  Separate functional areas requiring frequent vehicle access (e.g., kitchens, industrialareas, retail areas, refuse collection points) from billeting areas. 5.6.2.  Site Characteristics. 5.6.2.1.  Maintain good housekeeping by keeping areas within 30 feet of shelters or structures freeof items other than those items that are part of the infrastructure. 5.6.2.2.  When possible, position exterior doors so they cannot be easily targeted from the installa-tion perimeter or uncontrolled vantage points. 5.6.3.  Facility Standoff/Separation. Standoff distances are defined as the distance maintained betweena building or portion thereof and the potential location for an explosive detonation. Standoff distancesare based on the assumption that a controlled perimeter will create an opportunity to detect bombs andexplosives before they enter the  controlled perimeter. To make them effective planners must clearlydelineate the installation perimeter. This includes fencing, concertina wire, barricades, counter-mobil-ity barriers, ditches, police tape, or warning signs. The following table and figure highlight and illus-trate the minimum antiterrorism standards for expeditionary and temporary structures in Annex D ofUFC 4-010-01. 70AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006Table 5.3.

Standoff Distances and Separation for Expeditionary and Temporary Facilities. 5.7.  Threat Specific Standards. In addition to the minimum standards described above, the DoD Secu-rity Engineering Manual provides  guidance for incorporating additional measures to mitigate specificthreats. That guidance includes design strategies for mitigating the effects of specific aggressor tactics todefined levels of protection and the effect on building cost of applying those measures. 72AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 20065.7.1.  Power Generation and Distribution. Wood or chain link fence will be installed around all gen-erator, transformer and consolidated generator st ation locations. Enclosing generators in woodenbuildings is not authorized. 5.7.2.  Perimeter. Fences, either chain link or con certina, are authorized around the camp perimeter.Berms and sniper screens are authorized to bloc k vision. Perimeter lights  are authorized. A gravelperimeter road is authorized inside the berm. Culverts underneath the perimeter fence will be caged toprevent persons from crawling through. 5.7.3.  Gates. Covered inspection areas on the main gates are authorized as required by weather con-ditions. Gates will have lighted, heated, guard shacks. Tilt bar and swing gates are authorized. Locateclearing barrels inside the gates. 5.7.4.  Clearing Barrels. Clearing barrels will be installed at all access control points and outside theentrances to arms and ammunition storage areas, medical and dinning facilities. 5.7.5.  Walkways and decks. Pressure treated, rot-resistant lumber is the standard. If not available, orcost prohibitive, consider using composite decking material for co nstructing walkways and decks.Untreated wood can be used if  primed and painted. Paint any wo oden walkways with sand paint orother non-slip materials to reduce the chance of slipping, particularly in climates with snow and ice orextended rainy periods. Provide lighting wherever steps cannot be seen at night. 5.7.6.  Buried utilities. The BCE will maintain a database of all buried utilities. No job will be closedout until new underground utilities have been pr operly documented. No work will commence on aproject until a dig permit has been obtained. Digging permits should also be coordinated for commu-nication line clearance. Buried utilities will have caution tape at least one foot above the utility lines.Buried electrical lines will have signs posted at every turn in the line and wherever else needed by theterrain. 5.7.7.  Bunkers. Only bunker designs approved by th e Corps of Engineers, Engineer Research andDevelopment Center will be constr ucted. Sand bag bunkers will have the sand  bags protected fromsolar radiation and the wooden core protected from rot. Design factor is 110% of camp population forbunkers and fighting positions. No rmal planning factor is that 50%  of the population will be on theperimeter, with 50 % in bunkers. 5.7.8.  Guard Towers. Guard towers will be placed so every tower is visible to the immediate towerson the right and left so there is no dead space on the perimeter. Towers will have heat and light. Tow-ers will be hardened against small arms and mortar fire. 5.7.9.  Constructed fighting positions. Overhead cover design on fighting positions must be approvedby the task force engineer. Fighting positions must be inspected regularly for deterioration. A diggingpermit must be coordinated before any construction begins. 5.7.10.  Theaters and similar multipurpose facilities. These facilities will have a barrier to minimize acar bomb threat. Barrier can be a berm, HESCO bastions, Jersey barriers, or other method capable ofstopping a car or truck. Air induction units and other vents will be screened or fenced to reduce terror-ist threat of gas introduced into the duct systems. 5.7.11.  Water Plant. Water plants, wells, storage tanks and bladders will be fenced. 5.8.  Siren Warning System (Giant Voice). Force Protection planning should include the installation ofa dual tone warning system that supports voice and tone to alert personnel to local hazards and incidents.AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 200673The system should be sited to provide clear audible coverage of main work sites and billeting cantonmentareas. 5.9.  Mines, Improvised Explosive Devices and Unexploded Ordnance. The strength and capabilitiesof the US military make it an unstoppable force in the face of conventional symmetrical warfare. To bal-ance the battlefield, the enemy has resorted to asymmetrical warfare tactics of small guerilla units armedwith unconventional weaponry. Worldwide attacks over the last decade highlight this: suicide bombers inmarket squares, roadside daisy chain explosives  along the supply routes in Iraq, booby-trapped facilitiesin Afghanistan, and airliners used  as bombs during the September 1 1th attacks against New York andWashington DC. The military planner  and bare base beddown engineer mu st be constantly aware of thethreat of passive and active unconventional weapons. During the six months after cessation of major mil-itary actions during OIF, more US military personnel were killed by unconventional weapons and guerillainsurgents than were lost during direct combat actions against the Iraqi Army. 5.9.1.  A common threat at most expeditionary beddown and airfield sites is the presence of anti-per-sonnel explosive devices dispersed through enem y forces, insurgent groups or expended coalitionunexploded ordnance. This results in the common  EOD mantra to deployed personnel to ST AY ONTHE CONRETE. EOD personnel are e ssential for the clearing, de-min ing and safing of a potentialbeddown area. This is particularly critical during the planning and open the base module. If EOD hasnot cleared the area, it doesn’t matter how much equipment you have on site, you cannot initiate bed-down erection. Theater level CE planners must advocate at the planning meetings to ensure that EODis present on the survey ADVON team and if required in the initial cadre of personnel arriving to thesite. The new Airborne Engineer CONOPS incorporates this requirement into its SOP for airfield sur-veys. During OAF, coalition EOD personnel provided a myriad of sa fing and clearing operations. Amatrix of available methodologies and their advantages and disadvantages is found in Table 5.4.. Thisis to serve only as a general information sheet fo r engineer planners. All planning efforts shouldinclude the theater or deploying EOD commander or planner. Air Force engineers must remember thatEOD actions may be completed by other than Air Force personnel. 74AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006Table 5.4.

This is not intended to be a complete objective analysis. 5.9.2.  During OAF, Army Combat Engineering Battalions had to complete extensive explosive clear-ing operations prior to beddown delaying the es tablishment of stationary beddown operations. Atmany locations in Yugoslavia and the Balkans, the Army is still clearing portions of the airfields thatthey have been operating on for over 8 years. Smal l insurgent countries have seen a proliferation ofcounter-personnel mining operations in an attempt to quell civilian uprisings and keep dictatorial gov-ernments in power. In every area of the Middle East, Far East, African and Balkans theater of opera-tions, military personnel will be faced with the task of identifying the counter-personnel mine threat,presence and remediation of the threat. Conservative estimates identify over one billion counter-per-sonnel mines currently deployed throughout the world. Most in areas where location maps no longerexist. AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006755.9.3.  The construction of an improvised explosive device (IED) is simple: modify military ordnance,initiator/fuse, some plastic explosives and an i ndividual to trigger the explosion. This simplicitymakes it very difficult to eliminate the IED threat. Figure 5.7.  Explosive Potential and Evacuation Distances.  76AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 20061 – Based on the maximum amount of material that could reasonably fit into a container or vehicle. Variations possible. 2 – Governed by the ability of an unreinforced building to withstand severe damage or collapse. 3 – Governed by greater of fragment throw distance or glass breakage/falling glass hazard distance. Distances can be reduced for personnel wearing ballistic protection. Note that pipe bomb, suicide belt/vest, and briefcase/suitcase bomb are assumed to have a fragmentation characteristic that requires greater standoff distances than equal amounts of explosives in a vehicle. 4 – Assuming efficient mixing of the flammable gas with ambient air. 5 – Determined by U.S. firefighting practices wherein safe distances are approximately 4 times the flame height. Note that an LPG tank filled with high explosives would require a significantly greater standoff distance than if it were filled with LPG. AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 200677Chapter 6   FACILITIES UPGRADE, SUSTAINMENT AND MAINTENANCE 6.1.  Overview. This chapter discusses transitioning from short-term use temporary expeditionary facili-ties to semi-permanent and permane nt facilities. It also discusses various funding and programmingrequirements for beddown construction. 6.2.  Transition to Temporary Standard, Semi-Permanent and Permanent Facilities. Typically thebasis for transition to temporary standard facilities has relied on the  Joint Publication 4-04 requirementthat temporary standard facilities will be adopted when  the deployment is expected to last more than 6months, then temporary standards will increase usage up to 24 months. The realities of overseas deploy-ment and the support of theaters and areas of responsibility have required basing to exist for more than 24months, but usually less than 5 years to be considered as a standard for transition to even more permanentfacilities. When a base will become a main base for operations and logistics support in a theater, the like-lihood is that diplomatic and military agreements will require semi-permanent and permanent facilities tobe constructed. Sometimes this is with conveyance to the host nation as a grant for basing, while in othercases the facilities may be conveyed to the host nation with the stipulation that the facilities may be usedagain in case of contingencies. When this is the case, additional agreements may be required to establishpre-positioning sites for deployment resources. Depending on the reason for the conflict, the scope of thework and the length of use, construction may be through O&M or MILCON funding. Figure 6.1.  Prince Sultan Airbase – Enduring Presence Construction Standard. 78AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 20066.3.  Normal Transition to Temporary Facilities. Construction and quality of life upgrades should beprogrammed and planned as soon as  resources and mission  expectations allow. If initial beddown mis-sions are planned for long term US presence than CE planners should initiate and advocate for semi-per-manent construction standards as soon  as resources allow. This will free up critical BEAR assets forutilization in short term expeditionary, FOB and FOL bases. During the maturation of the mission, basesmay be identified for longer operational requirement s therefore requiring the upgrade of the base con-struction standards. 6.4.  Funding Transition and Beddown Construction. Engineering planners must be aware of fundingand programming requirements for all levels of expe ditionary and contingency beddown and construc-tion. Attempts to circumvent these programming and funding requirements usually results in significantdelays and paperwork in gaining the appropriate approvals. Although many of the authorities require upto 30 days of approval and processing, it is quicker than trying to go around the rules. Further details anddecision flow charts for deciding which authorities are appropriate for your requirements can be found inJP 4-04, Appendix F, pages F-3 through F-5. 6.4.1.  Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Funding: The Air Force is authorized to use annual O&Mfunds for construction projects less than $750K. This is a peacetime provision that is applicable duringcontingencies and emergencies. During combat or designated contingency operations, O&M may beused under certain circumstances to fund construction projects exceeding these thresholds. The theateror wing legal office must be consulted prior to expending O&M funding for contingency construction. 6.4.2.  Title 10, USC, Emergency and Contingency Construction: Title 10 USC contains numerousbroad authorities to fund contingency construction. 6.4.3.  Section 2803 Emergency Military Construction Authority: Section 2803 authorizes AF leader-ship to use up to $30M per year of unobligated military construction (MILCON) for projects that can-not wait for the normal MILCON  program submission and approval process. Section 2803 projectsrequire a 21-day Congressional notification period for members to question the applicability of utiliz-ing current year funds for the requested project. Planners need to be aware that 2803 funds are currentyear MILCON funds currently authorized for another project. If you utilize 2803 funds for a project,the AF loses a similar project elsewhere to fund the requirement. 6.4.4.  Section 2804 Contingency Construction Authority: Section 2804 funding authority allows theSecretary of Defense to designate a specific military construction program line item amount for con-tingency construction projects that cannot wait for normal MILCON submission and authorization.Section 2804 funding normally is less than $10M per year and requires a 21-day Congressional noti-fication period. 6.4.5.  Section 2805 Unspecified Minor Construction: Section 2805 authorizes the AF (and other ser-vices) a military construction program line item  for unspecified minor construction requirements.Project funded under this authority cannot ex ceed $1.5M. Projects exceeding $500K require a21-Congressional Notification period. 6.4.5.1.  CE construction planners should coordina te with USAF/ILEC to  request utilization ofthese funds. 6.4.5.2.  Exercise related construction (ERC) pr ojects complement and enhance the ChairmanJoint Chief of Staff (CJCS) Joint Training Plan Exercise Program. Projects will be developed toenhance the effectiveness of exercise activities, reduce overall exercise costs, enhance safety andAFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 200679improve training of engineer forces. ERC may be accomplished by US troops, combined US-hostnation engineer forces, or by contractor (accomplishment by  contractor is the least preferredoption). Where an ERC project is  planned in a country eligible fo r assistance, an HCA construc-tion project should be planned in conjunction with the ERC project. 6.4.5.2.1.  ERC is  defined as an unspecified minor co nstruction project, outside CONUS, insupport of an in-progress or planned CJ CS exercise that results in a faci lity, or facilities thatremain, in any part after the end of the exercise. 6.4.5.2.2.  The cost of a single ERC project  may not exceed $1,500,000. Each ERC projectmust be approved by the Joint  Staff and reported to Congress. No construction funds may beobligated until the appropriate Congressional committees have approved the project or a21-day waiting period has elapsed from the date of the notification. An ERC project includesall construction necessary to  produce a complete and usable facility. Construction costs canvary +/- 25% without the requirement to request Joint Staff approval. 6.4.6.  Section 2808 Construction Author ity in the Event of a Declarat ion of War or National Emer-gency: Section 2808 authority can only be granted after a Presiden tial declaration of war or nationalemergency. Section 2808 allows  the Secretary of Defense to ca rry out any military constructionproject for the war or national emergency within the total unobligated military construction program.Congress must be notified of all 2808 projects but does not require a 21-day delay of authorization offunding. 6.4.6.1.  Section 2808 authority was executed during OEF and OIF. Difficulties gaining access toauthorization of 2808 funds, lega l reviews and differing views of the extent of the authoritiescaused delays in executing critical contingency construction projects. 6.4.6.2.  Similar to Section 2803 fundi ng, funds are taken from current year authorized construc-tion projects. Normally, overseas projects are sacrificed to elim inate the cancellation of CONUSbased projects. 6.5.  Other Authorities and Sources of Funding.  6.5.1.  Burden sharing (Title 10, USC Section 2350j). This statute provides authority enabling theDOD to accept funds from host natio n or foreign governments for bu rden sharing of construction,supplies and services. Section 2350j funding is complicated by the inclusion of foreign nation invest-ment and partnering. Additional information of 2350j can be found in JP 4-04 page F-2. Engineeringplanners must involve their legal office in the consideration of utilizing this authority. 6.5.2.  Economy in Government Act (Title 31, USC, Section 1535). This statute allows for US Gov-ernment agencies, outside of the DOD, to fund AF  execution of contingency construction projectsproviding they have the funds and authority to do so. Your legal office is critical in making the deter-mination of request for utilization of this authority. 6.5.3.  Humanitarian and Civic Assistance (HCA) (Title 10, USC, Section 401). Joint force engineersmay work with host nation government agencies to repair or improve infrastructure and public facili-ties. These authorized and funded projects must fulfill unit training requirements that incidentally cre-ate humanitarian benefit to the local populace. HCAs are usually planned well in advance and areusually not in response to disasters, although some  have been executed following disasters. Specificengineer activities for which HCA funds can be us ed include construction of rudimentary surface80AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006transportation systems, well drilling, construction of  basic sanitation facilities and rudimentary con-struction and repair of facilities. 6.5.4.  Foreign Humanitarian Assistance (FHA). In disaster operations, the UN and the Department ofState’s Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (U SAID) may generate funded requirements for DODassistance. FHA programs focus on the use of DO D excess property, emergency transportation sup-port, disaster relief, or other support as necessary to alleviate urgent needs in a host country caused bysome type of natural or manmade disaster that might present serious threat to life or great damage toor loss of property. While other elements of the joint force are focused on immediate FHA, civil engi-neering support planning may focus on projects that provide expedient shelter for dislocated civilians.The joint force engineer and staff should work closely with the representatives of the host nation andUS Country Team. AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 200681Chapter 7   REDEPLOYMENT AND RECONSTITUTION 7.1.  Overview. Expeditionary Airbases will transition as the mission and operational requirementschange. Base transition can be either improvement of construction standards as outlined in Chapter 6 orreturn of the base back to host na tion ownerships when the US forces  depart from the site. This chapterwill focus on base closure and return of the site back to host nation and/or civilian ownership or manage-ment. 7.2.  Transition. Since eventually an expeditionary airbase will transition back to civilian or host nationcontrol, deployed units should understand the theater level redeployment and reconstitution plan to bettercarry out the operational requirem ents for their units. Redeploymen t operations are dependent upon thecombatant commander’s defined mission end state,  peacekeeping requirements and host nation supportrequirements. Reconstitution is defined as the process of returning deployed fo rces to full operationalreadiness, to include personnel actions, training a nd equipment repair and replacement. Redeploymentnormally occurs once the combatant commander has de creed that the deployed location will transitionfrom combat operations to civilian reconstruction or peacekeeping operations. Figure 7.1.  Recovery of BEAR Assets. 7.2.1.  Transition operations cover a wide range of requirements that must be met prior to the last USpersonnel or US contractor leaving the site. The general rule of thumb to go by is Leave the land andinfrastructure better than you found it. 7.2.2.  Base engineers have seen the fallout of leavi ng a base in less than pristine condition when weredeploy troops to an old s ite and run into the host nation engineer that was left with the clean-upheadache. Engineers will be responsible for the vast majority of clean-up requirements and in turn willprobably be some of the last troops to leave the site. 82AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 20067.3.  Redeployment. Redeployment applies to onward or forward  deployment as well as return to homestation. Redeployment planning is essential to an ef fective and efficient return of deployed resources orforward deployment of combat capability. Redeployment activities need to begin long before a redeploy-ment order is received. Normally, the planning process begins upon arrival at the deployed location. Thisensures all deployed resources are accounted for and redeployment movement activities comply with hostnation customs requirements. Redeployment is not deployment in reverse. First, fragmented UTCs or unitline numbers (ULN) are more likely to be incrementally redeploy ed/forward deployed to retain residualcapability at the original deployed location requiring the supportability of remaining forces. Planners needto plan for the movement of parts of units, UTCs, or ULNs. Secondly, it is common to receive redeploy-ment orders calling for the rede ployment of fragmented UTCs and UL Ns rather than a reverse TPFDD.Additionally, due to military, political or diplomatic reasons, redeployment may be far more rapid than thedeployment phase, which makes early-on redeployment planning all the more critical. 7.3.1.  During planning commanders must understand  that redeployment can be a significant engi-neering challenge, particularly when terminating overseas contingency operation. Civil engineer oper-ations support force redeployment through the preparation of facilities for  retrograde, completion ofconstruction projects and the refurbishment and turnover of property and real estate to the host nation. 7.3.2.  Additionally, engineers terminate leases and facility contracts, construct wash racks and otherredeployment facilities, prepare collection points and coordinate for the safe disposition of hazardouscargo. Commanders and civil engineers must be aware of legal consideration involved in these rede-ployment activities. 7.4.  General Considerations for Redeployment and Reconstitution. The situation, condition of assetsand the need for redeployment/reuse will dictate the extent and methods used for recovery and reconstitu-tion. During deployments, CE teams can anticipate increased loss of equipment, tools and other resourcesdue to increased utilization and harsh climatic conditions. Your teams should strive to replace worn-out ordestroyed assets as they are lost (prior to redeployment) as in-theater equipment funding is much strongerthan at home equipment accounts. 7.4.1.  CE leadership needs to ensure that funds expended are used to replace assets required and notjust desired as nice to haves.  There have been numerous instances of deployed teams purchasing thenext greatest technology only to find out that it does not meet their need. 7.4.2.  Teams also need to realize that assets purchased in theater to support operational requirements,that are not listed on you teams equipment supply list (ESL) or Vehicle authorization list (VAL), willneed to be transferred to  the incoming team for thei r use. This often occurs when units validate thepurchase of bobcats and gator transports in theater and hope to take them back for use at home station.This is not practical because if  you needed them in the ater so does your replacement. Secondly, atclose to $5,000 per hour for operation of airlift, it is cheaper to buy a new bobcat when you get home. 7.5.  Reconstitution of BEAR Assets. Once erected, BEAR assets are operated and maintained primarilyby Prime BEEF and Services personnel. Depending on the situation and the asset, selected 49 MMG per-sonnel, AFCESA’s CE Maintenance, Inspection and Repair Team (CEMIRT), or a trained theater supportcontractor may also assist. The senior on-scene commander, who is normally the AEF/AEW commander,must appoint a Bare Base Manager (BBM) at each location that is using BEAR. The BBM has custodialresponsibility for the BEAR assets until turned in for redeployment. Redeployment planning is a theaterresponsibility. Assistance in striking assets is normally requested  as needed from the 49 MMG throughAFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 200683Air Combat Command’s Logistics Plans office. Reconstitution occurs after the deployment missionrequirement has ended through either force redeploym ent or transition to temp orary or permanent stan-dard facilities and utilities. Reconstitution usually involves extended operations to clean, inventory; per-form intermediate- or depot-level maintenance and re pair and repackage assets for shipment or storage.This effort is normally handled by the asset owner, usually 49 MMG or a theater operating location, or ona limited basis it may include CEMIRT and AFCAP/LOGCAP/CONCAP or theater contractors prior toshipment for storage. 7.6.  Recovery. Unless there has been an attack with damage to the bare base, generally the term recoverymeans the dissembling and repacking of BEAR systems for redeployment shipment to another location orthe demobilization and readying of the base for return to the national owners. For facilities such as person-nel shelters, medical facilities, dining halls and smaller flightline shops, the user, Prime BEEF and logis-tics personnel generally accomplish this. For larger shelters/hangars this may have to be accomplished byRED HORSE, 49 MMG tea ms or trained teams from AFCAP/LOGCAP/CONCAP. Theater plannersshould consider whether mobile support teams should be established to conduct recovery operations andconduct user-level maintenance/repair prior to repacking. It may be readily apparent for some assets thatthey can be reused without reconstitution. All parties participating in recovery need to make sure that thedesignated BBM is properly informed and knows the condition of all assets before making the decision toredeploy them forward or reutilize in the field. If they are not in a condition to allow for immediate erec-tion and use for at least another six months, then the items must be identified as requiring maintenance oridentified that additional personnel and supplies may be required for erection and reuse. This is especiallyimportant when the assets are vehicles and equipment items such as  generators, high voltage electricaldistribution components, ROWPUs, pumps, bladders, etc., for utility system support. 7.7.  Civil Engineering Support of Transition Operations. The deployed engineering squadron is oneof the last teams to leave the contingency airbase. The engineers normally have the main responsibility forpreparing the base for transition to a civilian led task force, military peacekeeping operation, base closureor return of infrastructure to the  host nation. Civil engineer squadrons  should be prepared to support thefollowing transition requirements in addition to normal reconstitution and squadron redeployment priori-ties: 7.7.1.  Termination of base support contracts (refuse, Class IV materials, cleaning etc.). 7.7.2.  Preparation of documentation for turnover of facilities and real estate. 7.7.3.  Reconstitution of advance bases, staging areas and recovery/inventory and repacking of warreserve material. 7.7.4.  Definition and award of contingency support contracting (AFCAP, CONCAP, or LOGCAP) asoutlined in Chapter 8 of this volume. 7.7.5.  Cleanup (in-house or civilian contract) of contaminated sites and waste disposal areas. 7.7.6.  Repair of civil infrastructure damaged by US military operations and utilization. 7.7.7.  Construction of f acilities required for preparing assets for redeployment (marshalling yards,customs yards, wash racks etc.). 7.7.8.  Minefield marking and clearance. 84AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 20067.7.9.  Port surveys and coordination of port clearance requirements for movement of equip-ment andassets. 7.7.10.  Development and production of topographic, geographic and base utility tabs for future oper-ations. 7.7.11.  Construction of foreign humanitarian assistance and humanitarian civic assistance projects asdefined and negotiated by CREST or the theater engineer and combatant commander. 7.8.  Redeployment Scheduling, Validation and Transport. Redeployment is scheduled and prioritizedby the combatant commander’s mission requirements and planning staff. It is imperative that the Combat-ant Commander maintains the right balance of forces until he no longer requires them for mission accom-plishment. In an effort to streamline this process, base  level units need to have  a redeployment plan inplace to be able to adequately schedule and meet redeployment timelines. To support this, the CE plannerneeds to understand the process of  prioritizing, validating and schedu ling transport, regardless of themode of travel. 7.9.  Redeployment Requirements Validation. Once a unit has been prior itized for redeployment, theunit is responsible for confirming readiness posture, movement availability dates and passenger and cargodetails (load lists, weights etc.) to their higher commands, who will verify and prioritize movement sched-uling. 7.9.1.  The supported component commander receives the base reports and merges this into the rede-ployment TPFDD, and adjusts prioritizations as required. 7.9.2.  Once the prioritizations are finalized, the planning cell validates the lift requirements within thespecified TPFDD window of movement for USTRANSCOM movement scheduling. 7.9.3.  USTRANSCOM conducts a transportation feasibility review and coordinates unresolved trans-portation conflicts with the supported comma nder. Once completed, US-TRANSCOM forwardsrequirement back to the supported commander as an approved TPFDD that redeploying units use forscheduling. 7.9.4.  Once scheduled the unit will be directed to proceed, IAW flow schedule, to a port of debarka-tion for airlift back to home station or on to another mission requirement. 7.9.5.  Lessons Learned on rede ployment. If a redeploying unit  misrepresents its requirements(weights, passengers, availability, etc.) during the planning phase of this process or fails to adequatelyprepare for redeployment, their airlift or transport will be affected and possibly delayed. 7.9.5.1.  During OIF and OEF a number of redeploying CE units were frustrated at the inability ofUSTRANSCOM and TACC to schedule required airlift on the ap proved rotation dates. Duringinvestigation of the problem,  it was discovered that the retu rning units had requested datedchanges on a number of occasio ns, had changed passenger lists  and cargo load requirementsnecessitating changes to airframes. The best way to ensure that your team gets home as scheduledis to have a well thought out redeployment plan at the start of the deployment. This should includepassenger manifests (adjusts as the unit gains or loses personnel through combat attrition, injury orreorganization), anticipated load plans (what did you bring versus what are you brining home) androtational requirements (know which passengers and equipment need to go where). AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006857.9.5.2.  The USTRANSCOM and TACC scheduling and validation process normally takes a min-imum of 10 days during normal  operational requirements. During contingency operations andhigh periods of airlift demand this process can take up to 21 days with continual modifications andchanging mission requirements. As the CE planner or commander, you must keep visibility on theTPFDD, airflow scheduling validation and potential problems.  The only guarantee of a flighthome is the day that the TACC scheduler or logistics planner provides a tail number of the aircraftyou are flying home on. During redeployment, your logistics planner is your best friend; constantcoordination and partnering will get your team home. 7.10.  Environmental Requirements. The Air Force is committed to maintaining a high level of envi-ronmental quality during contingency operations. Civil  engineers have a special role in helping to meetthis commitment and in full c ompliance with environmental standards. While the degree of complia ncewith these standards is af fected by the location and activities performe d, and may vary during dif ferentphases of contingencies, the goal is to restore a site  to predeployment condition and return it to the hostnation or appropriate agency. Areas of consideration include: 7.10.1.  Hazardous waste storage/dis posal, using the DRMO as a dis posal agent, hazardous materiallabeling/packaging, mark/map abandoned wastewater facilities, preventing hazardous spills and min-imizing air/noise pollution. 7.10.2.  For detailed information on these and other environmental requirements during redeploymentand reconstitution, see AFH 10-222, Volume 4. 7.11.  Conclusion. The end of hostilities, operations or disaster  recovery does not  mean the end of theExpeditionary Engineer responsibility. The CE Commander and personnel ne ed to plan to be one of thelast support functions to leave the deployed locations as they will be responsible for recovering the site tobetter than its original condition, transfer of  ownership of agreed facilities and environmental clean-upand remediation. During OAF, OEF and OIF it was common for the  operations and logistics groups atdeployed locations to depart, leaving the Mission Support Group (MSG) Commander or the senior MSGsquadron commander in charge of closing and recovering the base pr ior to redeployment. CE plannersneed to start creating a redeployme nt plan during the in itial deployment to ensure they have adequateresources identified. 86AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006Chapter 8   CONTRACT AUGMENTATION PROGRAMS 8.1.  Overview. The military is one-third smaller today than a decade ago ye t averages almost twice thenumber of deployments and contingency operations. This operational tempo versus resources highlights aneed to augment operational capa bility throughout the Department of  Defense. In the early 1990s, theDOD created contract augmentation programs or  CAP (LOGCAP, CONCAP, and AFCAP). These pro-grams enabled the military to augment its current capabilities through the contract award of stand-by rapidresponse force contracted civilian capabilities. It is not cheap to contract the stand-by rapid response, pro-fessional expeditionary combat support and construction services of civilian contractors, but during con-tingency operations it frees up military personnel to complete military missions while civilian contractorstake care of non-military specific requirements. 8.2.  Air Force Guidance on Contractors in Theater of Operations. Civilian contractor personnelaccompanying Air Force forces are not combatants and must not be allowed to act as combatants duringAir Force operations. Civilian contractor personnel have historically provided support to fielded militaryforces and international law allows  for such activities. Therefore, it is Air Force policy to integrateincreased commercial support to the total force wher ever appropriate while preserving our core compe-tencies. 8.2.1.  The risks must be minimized when deciding to use contractors to provide essential services. Infact, a uniformed capability should be maintained to provide essential services in the event the opera-tional environment precludes the use of  contractors. AFMAN 10-401, Volume 2, Planning Formatsand Guidance, requires that full consideration of the impact of contractors must be addressed in devel-oping operational plans. Commanders should limit the designation of essential contract services (IAWDODI 3020.37, Continuation of Essential DOD Contractor Services During Crisis) to those trulyindispensable to the accomplishment of the unit’s operational mission. Contracts will identify whichservices are essential. If the contract has esse ntial services, contractor support requirements must beintegrated fully into the total force structur e and planning to ensure mission accomplishment . Anydetermination regarding commercial support must consider the essential services that must be main-tained and the risks associated due to possible contractor non-performance. Again, if contractors can’tbe used to do the job, military personnel must be integrated into the planning process. 8.2.2.  Contractors are expected to comply with  all applicable US and  international law. Unlessaddressed otherwise by international agreement, contractor personnel are subject to the law of thenation in which they are lo cated. This means that contractors must  be prepared to comply with alllocal taxes, immigration requirements, customs fo rmalities and duties, environmental rules, bond orinsurance requirements, work permits and transporta tion or safety codes. The f act that the militaryforce for which they are performing services enjoys certain exemptions from local law does not meancontractor personnel are also exempt--generally, contractor personnel are not exempt from local law.During a declared war, contractor personnel accompanying the armed forces are subject to the crimi-nal jurisdiction of the military and the Uniform Code of Military Justice. However, in all circum-stances contractors are subject to host nation criminal law, unless specifically addressed otherwise byinternational agreement. Contractor employees and other civilians accompanying the armed forcesmay also be prosecuted by the United States for criminal acts. AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006878.2.3.  When contractor personnel are deployed in support of Air Force operations, the Air Force mayprovide or make available, under  terms and conditions as specified  in the contract, force protectionand support services commensurate with those  provided to DOD civilian personnel to the extentauthorized by US and host nation law. These services may include but are not limited to medical/den-tal care, messing, quarters, special clothing, equipment, training, mail and emergency notification. AirForce units are to provide only t hose goods and services to contractor personnel that are specified inthe terms of the contract when authorized under host nation law or applicable international agreement.If the Government provides support services to contractor personnel, it may increase the overall costto the Government. Planning to provide this suppor t to contractors must include a careful review ofhost nation law and applicable international agreem ents as well as contract pricing, budget and mili-tary manpower (reference AFMAN 10-401 , Volume 2). Commanders and the requiring activity willdetermine which services are essential and submit requirements, including proposed support services,to the contracting officer to modify existing contracts. All future contracts will need a determination ifessential services exist and, if necessary , incorporate requirements in the  statement of work (SOW).SOW language should also include applicable deployment requirements, both medical and physical,and allow for contractor information system interoperability with USAF and/or government informa-tion systems. 8.2.4.  During contingencies that do not constitute international armed conflicts, the status of contrac-tor personnel accompanying the armed forces is entirely determined by host nation law or applicablestatus of forces agreements, although contractors are seldom included in such agreements. Duringcontingencies that constitute international arme d conflicts, contractor personnel are non-combatantpersons accompanying the armed forces but may be  subject to hostile action because of the supportthey provide in close proximity to combat forces.  Commanders should take care to ensure contractorpersonnel are not used in any mann er that would jeopardize their status under international law asnon-combatant persons accompanying the armed for ces. Assuming they have not jeopardized theirstatus as noncombatants, if cap tured during an international arme d conflict, contractor personnelaccompanying the armed forces are afforded the same protection granted to Prisoners of War (POWs)under the Third Geneva Convention of 1949. 8.2.5.  Air Force commanders should not issue firearms to contract or personnel operating on theirinstallations, nor should they allow contractor personnel to carry personally owned weapons. With theexpress permission of the ge ographic combatant commander and in  consultation with host nationauthorities, Air Force commanders may deviate from this prohib ition of firearms only in the mostunusual circumstances (e.g., for protection from bandits or dangerous animals if no military personnelare present to provide protection). 8.2.6.  Air Force commande rs should not issue military garmen ts (e.g., battle dress uniforms orGore-Tex jackets) to contractor personnel. Exceptions may be made for compelling reasons such as aneed for chemical protective equipment when the  contract requires the Government to issue suchitems rather than requiring the contractor to provide them to its personnel. Should commanders issueany type of standard uniform item to contractor personnel, care must be taken to require that the con-tractor personnel be distinguishable from military personnel with some distinctively colored patches,armbands, or headgear. 8.2.7.  Although many contractor personnel supporting Air Force operations are former military mem-bers, the contract and commanders must make it cl ear that contractor personnel have no military sta-tus. 88AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 20068.3.  Air Force Contract Augmentation Program. Air Force policy is to in tegrate increased commer-cial support into the total force wherever appropria te while preserving its co re uniformed competencies(for complete Air Force policy govern ing contractors in the theater, see Appendix E). In support of this,the AF has developed the AFCAP concept. The AFCAP contract provides the following support. 8.3.1.  Commander Support. AFCAP provides commanders a responsive, force multiplier option toaugment or relieve expeditionary combat support functions participating in military operations otherthan war (MOOTW) or small-scale contingencies (SSCs). 8.3.2.  Quick Response, Contract Deployment Capability. AFCAP is a contract with extensive world-wide support capabilities, able  to respond in minimal time. Capab ilities focus on temporary contin-gency skills and/or resources to  sustain military forces participating in MOOTW/SSCs or to recoverfrom a natural disaster, accident, or terrorist attack. 8.3.3.  Planning and Deployment. The contractor shall provide the  personnel, equipment, materials,services, travel and all other me ans necessary to provide a  quick response, worldwide planning anddeployment capability. Planning is expected to be available within the contractor’s program manage-ment team and other company resources. Deployment capabilities are to be obtained as required for asite-specific scenario. The capabilities under this contract are intended to support Air Force MOOTW/SSC activities operating in support of National  Command Authority missions, which could include(but are not limited to) joint or combined United States military forces acting as part of or in concertwith United Nations (UN), North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), multinational force, or otherentities. MOOTW/SSCs may include Air Force required support to na tural disaster relief operationswithin and outside CONUS. 8.3.4.  Deployment Capabilities. The principal effort of this contract will be to  provide deploymentcapabilities generally aligned with Air Force combat suppor t and combat service support functionsassociated with expeditionary combat support, to include the Civil Engineer and Services career fieldsand to provide logistic support that reduces a dependence on scarce war reserve materiel stockpiles. Apartial list of skills typically required include: carpentry, plumbing, electrical, mechanical (e.g., refrig-eration, air conditioning, heat, controls, etc.), heavy equipment, paint, power production, food service,lodging management, recreational services, housekeeping services, laundry plant operation, variousutility plant operations (e.g.,  water, sewage, solid waste disposal, et c.), structural fire protection andfire crash rescue, unexploded or dnance (UXO) technician (e.g., cl earing sub-scale practice bombs),emergency management, professional engineering, and project and program management. 8.3.5.  Program Management Office. The contractor shall provide the necessary supplies, equipmentand personnel to sustain administrative/management support for the Air Force Contract AugmentationProgram (AFCAP). Minimum requirements include: having a dedicated program management officewithin a 25-mile radius of Tyndall AFB, FL, with the capability to develop Rough Order of Magnitude(ROM) cost estimates and execute individual task  orders. This program management of fice shall beavailable for support 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. 8.3.6.  Types of Response. Because military forces are trained and equipped for rapid deployment andflexible support for a variety of scenarios, the e xpectation is that initial response to a MOOTW/SSCwill generally be assigned to mi litary forces. As these forces establish a ba se(s) of operations andextended activities are likely to occur , AFCAP relief, augmentation, or expansion are potentialresource options. However, the above statement does not rule out the possibility that AFCAP contractsupport may be the initial responder  in selected scenarios, particularly small scale, fast moving, iso-AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 200689lated location scenarios or during  worldwide recovery operations. In addition, work may includeMOOTW/SSC backfill support at existing operational Air Force bases within and outside the UnitedStates to augment sustaining forces. 8.3.7.  Background. AFCAP represents an initiative to contract for base operating support and tempo-rary construction capabilities to relieve or augment military support forces and resources involved inMOOTW/SSCs. MOOTW are described as military actions, except thos e associated with sustained,large-scale combat operations and SSC is a new  term for military operations other than war. Thesemilitary actions can be applied to complement any combination of the other instruments of nationalpower and occur before and after war [Joint Publication 3-07]. Generally, these operations will occurin a noncombatant, forward deploy ed environment (outside United States territory). However, thisdoes not eliminate the possibility of natural disaster  support or home base backfill sustainment sup-port in the United States. 8.3.8.  Typical Air Force Deployment Locations. With rare exceptions, Air Force deployments are tiedto airfields which typically contain at least some existing buildings  and utility infrastructure. There-fore, deployment support will usually include a variety of operation and maintenance (O&M) require-ments to fixed, existing real property, as well as providing measures to augment or emplace additionaltemporary services and facilities. 8.3.9.  Customers. Through the AFCAP Program Manageme nt Office, this contract is established tosupport Air Force major commands (MAJCOM) and associated component commanders. 8.3.10.

LOGCAP is authorized by Army Regulation700-137, Logistics Civil Augmentation Program (LOGCAP). The Department of the Army’s DeputyChief of Staff, Logistics (DCSLOG) is the proponent, and the Army Corps of Engineers is the contractingactivity. Its purpose is to use civilian contractors to perform selected services for military forces deployedto a theater of operations. The support includes trans portation, food service, ice, potable water, laundry,showers, latrines, refuse removal, contingency equipment, and an unskilled labor pool. The mission state-ment requires the contractor, on order and within 15 days , to initiate specific logistical and engineeringsupport for 20,000 arriving troops for up to 180 days. 8.7.1.  LOGCAP should be accessed through the Army’s theater level G4/S4 (Logistics and Engineer-ing) staff or the CFACC Engineer (A7). LOGCAP is managed by the LOGCAP Support Unit (LSU)in Alexandria, Virginia. If you require direct access or have additional questions on LOGCAP organi-zation, capabilities, and execution, contact the LSU at: AMCLG-TPU, LOGCAP Support Unit, 5001Eisenhower Avenue, Alexandria, VA 22333-0001, (703) 617-0556 or call DSN 767-0556. 8.7.2.  LOGCAP is primarily designed for use in ar eas where no bilateral or multilateral agreementsexist. However, LOGCAP may provide additional support in areas  with formal host nation support(HNS) agreements, where other contractors are involved, or where peacetime support contracts exist.LOGCAP is also available during Continental United States (CONUS) mobilizations to assist theCONUS support base and help units get ready for war. 8.7.3.  LOGCAP includes all pre-planned logistics and engineering/construction oriented contingencycontracts actually awarded. LOGCAP also includes peacetime contracts which include contingencyclauses that provide rapid and responsive capability that augments US forces’ capabilities by meetinglogistics and engineering/construction requirements. 8.7.4.  The Army has used contr actors to provide supplies and se rvices during both peacetime andcontingencies dating back to the Revolutionary War. LOGCAP was established on 6 December 1985with the publication of Army Regulation 700-137, Logistics Civil Augmentation Program. The newlyestablished program was used in  1988 when the Third United S tates Army requested that the U.S.Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) contract out a management plan  to construct and maintain twoAFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 200695petroleum pipeline systems in Southwest Asia in support of conti ngency operations. Since its incep-tion, LOGCAP has supported US Army operations in Rwanda, Haiti, Saudi Arabia, Kosovo, Ecuador,Qatar, Italy, Southern Europe, Bosnia, Panama, Korea, Kuwait, Afghanistan, and Iraq. 8.7.5.  LOGCAP capabilities include supply operations, clot hing exchange and repair, mortuaryaffairs, billeting, facilities management, information management, transportation, engineering andconstruction, equipment retrograde, laundry, food services, hazardous waste disposal, personnel sup-port to include MWR, maintenanc e, medical services, power generation and distribution, and otheroperations and services. 8.8.  US Navy Contingency Construction Capabilities (CONCAP). The Navy's civilian augmentationprogram was started to enhance the Naval Facilities Engineering  Command's (NAVFAC) ability torespond to global contingencies. The immediate need was to supplement the  capabilities of local com-manders and regional resources. 8.8.1.  CONCAP provides the Navy and Marine Corps with a responsive contracting vehicle ready torespond to contingencies or natural disasters. It provides for indefinite deliveries and quantities usinga cost-plus-award-fee contract for design, construction and services to support the Navy in war, disas-ter recovery, and military operations other than war. CONCAP is suitable for those situations in whichthe mission parameters exceed normal acquisition  timing, there is an aust ere contingency environ-ment, and facility requirements are not well defined. 8.8.2.  The contract calls for a broad range of capabilities in both vertical and horizontal constructionscenarios. 8.8.3.  CONCAP helps the Navy stay within its force ceilings and frees uniformed Navy personnel forcontingency operations. The contract specifies what may be required and includes time parameters forsetting up quick, behind-the-lines  facility support for troops. It also  frees up Seabees to support thefight. 8.8.4.  CONCAP capabilities include: 8.8.4.1.  Horizontal/vertical construction (runways, roads, br idges, causeways, piers, berthing/messing facilities, depots, warehouses, clinics, field hospitals, operational/maintenance facilities,communications infrastructure, and ammunition dumps). 8.8.4.2.  Specialty construction and engineering (d redging, aerial photography, soils engineeringand surveys, operation of power generation, concrete and asphalt plants, POL facilities, and envi-ronmental restoration). 8.8.4.3.  CONCAP’s primary focus is to support day-to-day operations, construction, and manage-ment of Navy permanent  bases. CONCAP is not a viable alternative for initial standard contin-gency construction, but can be ut ilized in the event AFCAP or  LOGCAP are not available forlarge-scale permanent construction requirements at expeditionary beddown locations. 8.8.5.  CONCAP has been utilized dur ing requirements in Somalia, Haiti, and Bosnia; during Hurri-cane Andrew (October 1995), Hurricane Bertha (July 1996), and Hurricane Fran (September 1996). In2002, CONCAP built detention facilities at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. 8.9.  Conclusion. The various contract augmentation programs offer the component/theater engineer andcommander various options, other than utilization of  limited military resources, to complete specified96AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006expeditionary combat support services, construction,  management, and logistics. The increased cost isworth the on-call capabilities that the programs offer. All programs must be accessed through the appro-priate management function: AFCAP through AFCESA, at Tyndall AFB; LOGCAP via LSU in Alexan-dria, Virginia; and CONCAP through NAVFAC at the Washington Navy Yard in Washington DC. 8.10.

The US Army utilizes the S outh-East Asia Hut (SEA hut) as  its base module for temporaryand semi permanent construction standard billeting. The SEA hut is a wood framed, elevated buildingwith exterior covered walkways that is utilized for billeting. SEA Huts are normally grouped togetherand are collocated with a latrine and shower huts. Standard SEA huts are 512 square feet, with a stan-dard SEA hut cluster having five bays and a latrine (2,944 sq ft). SEA hut structures provide a greaterdegree of safety and comfort than hard backed GP Mediums or TEMPER tent. SEA huts may be sub-divided for individual rooms and common areas based on grade/rank of inhabitants. SEA huts providean expedient and more cost effective solution than contracted modular facilities as they are easily fab-ricated by either contract or military labor. SEA huts organized in this manner minimize the distancepersonnel are required to walk to shower and latrine facilities and increases unit cohesion by maintain-ing company, platoon and squad integrity. A3.4.2.  Private (modular or partitioned SEA hut) and semi-private billeting space for the housing oflong-term (exceeding 6 months) government civilian/ all contractor employees and airmen should beconsidered at the earliest possible time. The Theat er Engineer (A7) will de termine grade equivalen-cies for DOD contractor employees. The MSG Commander is delegated the responsibility to resolveprivate room availability for long-term civilian/contractor employees and airmen at their assigned air-base. AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006113A3.4.3.  All 110/220 volt electric outlets in billeting facilities will  be protected by not more than 30amp ground fault circuit interrupter.

Due to intrusion and security concerns, SCIF Facilities will use a battery operated firealarm and detection system. Central reporting lines and radio transmitted alarms will not broadcastthrough the SCIF shielding and/or pose a threat for release of secure compartmental information. A3.36.  Utilities. Utility systems shall be designed based on current applicable military handbooks, tech-nical manuals and guidance. Engineering calculations will be used to size the system. All utility designswill be approved by Depu ty Chief of Staff for Engineering (DCSENG), United States Army, Europe(USAREUR) before construction begins. A3.36.1.  Electric Power. Where economically supportable and practicable, base camp power gridswill be connected to commercial power . Smaller or remote base camps that cannot be economicallyconnected to the commercial power grid are author ized to construct central power plants capable tosupport 125% of camp maximum demand load, or use distributed generators of sufficient capacity tosupport maximum demand loads. An  economic analysis should be co mpleted to determine the mostcost effective power plant/generator solution. In all cases, critical fa cilities will be identified in themaster plan by the mission support group commander and have back-up generator power. Non-criticalfacilities that have stand-alone distr ibuted generators will not have any b ack-up generator power. Amaximum of 10% of total generators  (one minimum) serving non-critical facilities are authorized asreserve generators that can be placed in service quickly in case a generator serving a non-critical facil-ity has a major failure. 120AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006A3.36.1.1.  Determination of appropriate size for generators is not a simple task, as many genera-tors are typically over-sized for loads served. Sizing of generators  shall include an evaluation ofactual and expected loads considering appropriate demand and load diversity factors, along with areview of any historical demand load data for similar base camps. Engine-generator sets may needde-rating to account for use of JP -8 fuel (rather than  diesel), altitude, temperature and startingrequirements for any large load specialized equipment (e.g., hospital X-ray machines). In manycases, load banks have been used to ensure adequate performance of under loaded engine-genera-tor sets. Under loaded engine-generators may  operate unsatisfactorily, fail prematurely, andrequire more maintenance and overhauls due to  excessive formation of carbon deposits in theengine. The use of load banks and premature engine overhauls can be avoided if engine-generatorsare right-sized for the load. A complete and through analysis of the affected electrical system mustbe accomplished to ensure power plant requirements are properly defined. Leasing of generatorsfor periods greater than six months is generally not cost effective. A3.36.1.2.  Where stand-alone distributed generators are the main power source, they will be sizedso no generator set is loaded less than 50%. A3.36.1.3.  Electrical power systems for the MOBs and forward operating bases can be composedof sub-transmission lines to main substations; distribution lines to distribution substations; utiliza-tion lines to distribution transformers; and gene rators to provide emergency, stand-by and/orprime power for mission base camp facilities. Application of the new Distributed Generation (DG)Technology other than the matured Internal Combustion (IC) Genset (diesel engines) technology,maybe considered if economically feasible, environmental impacts and emissions are critical, andalternative fuels for DG applications are available. DG including IC Gensets allow cogeneration(combined heat and power). The waste heat from power generation may be recovered and used tooffset costs. Today, the capital cost of an IC Genset is 200-350  $/Kilowatt (kW) rating for dieseland 400-1000 $/kW for natural ga s. Operations and Maintenance (O&M) costs for both typesexcluding fuel are 0.01$/kWh/yr. Currently, DGs have high initia l costs; however they are thefuture for power generation. A3.36.1.4.  At end state or earlier, electric power supply, transformers 400/208 volts 50 Hertz (Hz)and/or 230/120 volts 50  Hz should be used in lieu of 208/120 volt generators. 50 Hz to 60 Hzrotating or static (preferred) fre quency converters should be used in lieu of 60 Hz generators.Applicable electrical industry codes, standards, or publications will apply to equipment, materialsand construction covered in th e Base Camp Facilities S tandards. The minimum requirements ofthe latest version of NFPA-70, National Electrical Code, and American National Standards Insti-tute C2, the National Electrical Safety Code, will be met and exceeded when requirements that aremore stringent are specified an d/or directed. These standards provide policy and guidance formain and forward base camp design  criteria and standards for electrical power supply and distri-bution systems. Requirements of Military Handbook 1191, Medical and Dental Treatment FacilityCriteria, and other medical facilities  design office criteria will be  considered for power arrange-ments for medical facilities. A3.36.1.5.  All facilities th at are used for or c ontain housing, office space, or other a reas thatrequire the use of electric devices and/or equipment will be supplied with sufficient fixed electri-cal outlets. SEA huts used for housing will have eight fixed duplex electrical outlets. All facilitiesthat require illumination to perform tasks or in  order to provide a safe living, working, or recre-ational environment will be equipped with sufficient electric lights. AFPAM10-219V6   1 FEBRUARY 2006121A3.36.2.  Heating, Ventilation & Air Conditioning (HVAC). At a minimum, all facilities where per-sonnel live, work or recreate will be provided heating. Install ECUs that provide heating and coolingcapabilities whenever possible. Large facilities such as dining facilities an d expeditionary hospitalsshould be provided with central HVAC systems. Camps will utilize  installed central heating/coolingsystems where already existing or as economically feasible. Storage areas will only be provided heat-ing/cooling services as needed to address specific storage requirements of designated facilities types.When temporary and semi-permanent facilities such as SEA huts utilize ECUs, they will be sized toensure delivery of heating/cooling as follows. A3.36.2.1.  The standard for maximum indoor temperature in winter is 68oF and minimum indoortemperature in summer is 78oF. Temperature strips are installed in administrative areas and livingspaces wherever ECUs are utilized. A3.36.2.2.

A3.37.  Water. The order of preference for potable water at MOBs is: A3.37.1.  Joint Contracting Center (JCC) will contract to tie into local municipalities if it is economi-cally feasible and meets Army health and force protection standards. The installation of a water puri-fying station, such as a UV-60, Transportable Water Purification and Disinfection System, should beconsidered in the start up cost. A3.37.2.  Installation of wells for potable water is authorized. Site planning should consider installingwater storage distribution systems if economically feasible. A mi nimum of two wells per camp, oneprimary and one for back up are au thorized. The expense of mobilization for drilling equipment rep-resents a major cost of providing a well. Therefore, local contractors should be hired to perform welldrilling. Additional wells may be dr illed based on the capability of the  first two wells to supply therequired amount of water. Wells should be within camp boundaries. A3.37.3.  The least desira ble option is trucking po table water and/or bottle  water to the base camp.The cost of purchasing and maintaining the trucks, along with drivers and the reoccurring cost of bot-tle water to include purchase, transport, storage,  and waste disposal needs should be included in theinitial cost estimate. A3.38.  Wastewater Treatment Plant. The initial assessment for a base  camp should have a design forthe installation of a wastewater plan t based on projected population si ze of the camp, to include Alliedforces and local nationals. Coordination with JCC s hould be utilized to dete rmine if connection to amunicipal wastewater treatment plant is economically feasible and  environmentally sound. Upgrades toexisting sewage treatment plants are authorized to allow for effective treatment of waste being generatedon that facility. Connection to local  waste treatment facilities should be  made only if the facilities meetArmy standards. Upgrades will be limited to the expansion of the plant’s current capabilities to handle theincreased daily flows. A3.39.  Quality of Life (QOL) and Personnel Support.
