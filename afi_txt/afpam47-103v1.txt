Pro sthesis is a general term that applieProsthetic dentistry (prosthodontics) of fabricating artifici al replacements for missing oral structures. 1.3.  Specialty  Duties. The duties and responsibilspecialty increase as a p erson grows in knowledge,  skill, and grade. These duties b egin by perform ing routine procedures in the various areas of fixed, partial, and complete dentures. As skills and knowledge increase, m ore advanced procedures are learned th rough on-the-job training or in advanced training courses. The technician who de monstrates personal  and professional m aturity is expected to assum e supervisory responsibilities. These duties include laboratory training, labo ratory supervision, and administrative and leadership positions. A m ore extensive breakdown of skill a nd career progression is described in the Air Force Dental Laboratory Specialty Career Field Education and Training Plan. 1.4. Professional and Patient Relationships. A special stan dard of ethical  behavior is re quired of all  people involved in health care delivery. That is, a spirit of service and personal commitment must be the controlling factor in duty performance. Supporting patient care requires committed and responsible duty performance.

Technician’s Relationship to the Dentist. As a  professional, a technician  must m aintain knowledge and proficiency by continuing his or he r education. Every restoration the technician makes must represent his or her best effort. The technician must f ollow the dentist’s prescription exactly. In the technician’s judgm ent, if a prescr iption change is indicated, the dentist m ust be  consulted. Technicians m ust conduct them selves  in a professional m anner, especially when patients are present. Pro fessionally oriented conversations between a technician and a dentis t are privileged communications that must not be repeated to others.  1.4.3. Technician’s Relationship to the Patient:  1.4.3.1. The technician must fabricate each prosthesis to the highest standard of which he or she AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  29 is capable. The techn ician is respon sible for any deliberate inappropriate actions resulting in failure of the prosthesis.  1.4.3.2. The technician’s moral responsibility is to  the patient. The technician must behave in a professional manner at all tim es. NOTE: Because the technician and dentist are jud ged on the basis of observed behavior, they must ensure their behavior is always acceptable.  1.4.3.3.

Work  Positions. Improper posture can produce fatigue, pain, and discom fort. Sitting with your head lowered forward can cause a feeling  of cramping in the back of your neck, and a curved spine can cause backache. General health can  be impaired because po or posture could caus e displacement of the  internal organs. The following are proper postures for the positions in dental laboratory work: 1.5.1.  Standing  Position. Stand erect, with your legs comfortably parted. This posture ensures maximum stability. The weight is carried m ainly on the balls of your feet. In this position, an imaginary line dropped from  the base of the ear  would pass through your shoulder, hip joint, and kneecap and just in front of your ankle. 1.5.2. Sitting Position. Sit erect. In this position, an im aginary line would pass through your ear, shoulder, and hip joint. Sit as far back in your chair as possible. W hen you work at a desk or bench, your body should bend forward from the waist without breaking the straight line previously described. 1.6.  Room  Illumination.

Properly filtered ventilation is essential for good health and maintaining a positive working attitude. Ventilation supplies clean air at a controlled temperature so the environment is kept safe and comfortable. A controlled tem perature is also  essential when working  with dental m aterials. Waxes and investm ents require a controlled temp erature of approxim ately 70 - 72 degrees to achieve proper expansion for accurate-fitting restorations. 1.7.2. Ventilation should be sufficient to rem ove fu mes, gases, and excessive heat and dust. In some areas of dental laboratories,  some form of m echanical ventilation is required to rem ove air contaminants such as dust and fumes.

A dental laboratory must be neat and orderly at all times. Clean, orderly surroundings are conduc ive to the best efforts and safe ty of all concerned. Continuous, routine care of the laboratory is ev eryone’s responsibility. The easiest way to maintain a neat work area is to clean the area after each pronecessary each even ing to prepar e the laboratory for use the nextcompleted, work benches, lathes, and bench engines must be cleaned and dusted. Sinks must be emptied and scoured, and water baths m ust be drained. As  required by clinic policy, floors should be swept, mopped, and waxed. Instruments must be cleaned and returned to their proper storage areas. 1.10. Eye Protection. You must constantly be alert to hazards  that might harm your eyes. Intense light from gas-oxygen torches, acids, corrosive fum es, and flying particles pose serious  safety hazards in the laboratory. All personnel must be trained to use an approved eyewash station which should be located in the laboratory for easy access by all personnel. This station will be used to flush the eyes with cold water in the event hazardous materials get into the eyes. (For guidelines on eyewash station requirements, see AFOSH Standard 91-32, Emergency Shower and Eyewash Units.) Neutralizers for chemicals used in the laboratory must be available. Refer to material safety data sheets (MSDS) for specific neutralizers. WARNING WEAR PR OTECTIVE GLASS ES OR GOGGLPOSSIBILITY OF EYE DAMAGE EXISTS. 1.11. Hand Care: ES WHE N T HE REM OTEST 1.11.1. Fingernails should be trimmed short so they  do not collect dirt or becom e torn and cause injury to fingertips. Certain laboratory procedures require wearing rubber gloves; other procedures require wearing insulated gloves or mitts. Using hand creams frequently during cold weather helps prevent chapping.  1.11.2. Give immediate care to all scratches, cuts, burns , or bruises to lessen th e risk of infection. Appliances worn by patients can harbor organism s that m ay cause serious infection or disease through cuts or breaks in the skin. Therefore, al ways wear latex or rubber gloves when pouring impressions, cleaning impression trays, or handling a prosthesis that was in the patient’s mouth. 1.11.3. Keep hands clean by frequently brushing them with a handbrush, soap, and water. Remove rings and bracelets to prevent catching them in equipment. 1.12. Hair Care. Hair should be trimm ed short to prevent tangling it in certainly be singed or set on fire near an open flame. If the need is obvious, use hairnets or bobby pins. 1.13.  Clothing. As with long hair, dangling shirttails, sleeves, and neckties can pose a problem near lathes and flames. A securely fastened, well-fitting lab coat provides protection. Use an apron over your lab coat when pouring impressions or cleaning im pression trays. This clothing m ay be disposable or cleaned by a laundry service. 1.14. Instruments. As a general rule, sharp instrum ents are  less dangerous than dull ones. Rather than straining to use a dull tool, you can exercise m ore deliberate control with a sharp one. Keep all cutting lathes. Long hair will alm ost AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  tools sharply pointed or edged, Dispose of broken instruments and worn or broken lab blades in an appropriate “sharps” container. 1.15. Lathes and Rotary Attachments: but don’t carry dangerous, unshiel ded instrum ents on your person. 31 1.15.1. Wear protective goggles or glasses during finishing and polishing procedures. Do not leave a running lathe unattended; turn it off when it is not in use. 1.15.2. Ensure all chucks and attachm ents are secure ly mounted before starting the lathe. Do not use attachments that vibrate or do not run true. Do not adjust or re place chucks, wheels, or similar attachments while the lathe is runn ing unless the  machine is equipped with an autom atic chuck. Do not attempt to stop a running lathe by grasping the attachment with your hands. to an angle that deflect s flying debris away 1.15.3. Adjust the glass shield of high speed lathes from the face. Follow  the m anufacturer’s direct ions f or inser ting a ttachments, starting and stopping the lathe, and releasing the attachments. 1.16. Heat Sources and Flammable Substances: 1.16.1. ALL DENTAL LABORATORY PERSONNEL MUST KNOW L OCAL PROCEDURES FOR REPORTING FIRES, W HERE THE FIRE  EXTINGUISHER IS  KEPT, AND HOW  T O USE IT. 1.16.2. After use, turn off equipm ent having electric heating elem ents. Be aware that these units have a tendency to stay hot long after they are switched off.  1.16.3. Do not leave a Bunsen burner or blowtoimmediately after use. Control the height of a B unsen burner flame. (A 3-inch flame is sufficient for alm ost all laboratory procedures.)

K eep all acid cont ainers properly m arked and covere d when they are not in use. Position them to prevent spills. Use a proper mask to prevent inhalation of airborne dust during grinding and polishing procedures when adequate exhaust machinery is not available. 1.18. Electrical Connections. Report all electrical defects (frayed cords, loose plugs,  etc.) as so on as they are discovered. Treat all electrical wires as “live” wires. Unplug all equipment not in use unless it is required to be plugged in at all times for proper function (for example, porcelain ovens). 1.19. Compressed Air: 1.19.1. Do not allow horseplay around com pressed air. (NOTE: Serious injuries have occurred by the entry of com pressed air in to the body. Laboratory air pressu re is routin ely 30 lb/in 2, and it is estimated that a pressure of 4 lb/in2 will rupture intestines.) 1.19.2. Wear eye protection at all tim es when compressed air is being used. Do not use m ore than the recom mended pr essure in pressurized  cu ring units or other compressed air-pow ered equipment. Do not use more than 30 lb/in 2 for cleaning purposes. Label each air outlet acco rding to the air pressure available (lb/in2). AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 32   Section 1D—Infection Control in the Laboratory 1.20. Introduction: 1.20.1. Preventing the spread of inf ectious disease is a factor less obvious than safety, but equally as important in m aintaining the health and well-being of patients and clin ic personnel. Infection control procedures reduce the sp read of pathogenic m icroorganisms by breaking the chain of infection at critical points in the fabrication, repair, and delivery of prostheses. 1.20.2. The key concept in dental laboratory infec contaminated items before they are allowed to reach the production area of the laboratory. If this is done, dental laboratory personnel and equipment will not become contaminated.  tion control is to clean and disinfect all1.21. Exposure and Precautions: 1.21.1. Dental health care workers (DHCW ) are  routinely exposed to  blood, saliva, and other potentially infectious materials. Because of the potential for cross-contamination, dental personnel must follow strict infection control precautions. 1.21.2. Dental laboratory technicians are also susceptible to infection via cross-contamination. For example, it has been docum ented that they are alm ost three tim es more likely to be exposed to hepatitis B than the general population. Because of  this potential for exposure, dental laboratory personnel are included in the hepatitis B high-risk population. 1.21.3. Some of the other potential pathogens the de ntal laboratory technician may be exposed to include the hum an i mmunodeficiency virus (H IV), tubercle bacillus (tuberculous), and herpes virus (primary and secondary herpes). types of infectious m icroorganisms from  1.21.4. The potential for transm ission of various impressions and prostheses to dental laboratopresent, and universal precautions form  the foundation  for th e prev ention of cross-con tamination. As described  by OSHA, “Universal Precautions” indicates all blworkplace should be treated as potentially infectious.  1.21.5. In addition, routine infection control procedures should be developed and implemented for every patient. The term Standard Universal Precautions refers to the standard precautions applied universally to all patients, regardle ss of the infectious status, to  reduce the risk of transmission of https://www.afms.mil/afdental/almajltr/1997/970414.pdf.) Various bloodborne pathogens. (See methods have been developed to minim ize exposure of dental personnel to  potentially infectious microbes.

Infection Control Terminology. The following terms apply to infection control: 1.22.1. Antiseptic. An antisep tic is a chem ical agent applie d to a tis sue to inhib it the growth of  microorganisms. 1.22.2. Asepsis. Asepsis is a pathog en-free condition; that is, the process of preventing the access of microrganisms.  1.22.3. Aseptic Technique. Proper use of dental instrum ents to ensure sterilized an d disinfected items are not contaminated before use is the aseptic technique. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  33 1.22.4. Bioburden. Bioburden is the num ber and type of  microorganisms that m ust be rem oved via mechanical debridement to allow proper disinfection. 1.22.5.  Dental  Item  Classifications. Dental item s can be classif ied a s critica l, se micritical, or  noncritical in their need for ster disinfection. As f ollows, these  classifications are determined by where and how the items are used: ilization or various levels of1.22.5.1. Critical Items. Critical items are obje cts that en ter the skin, mucous membrane, or vascular sys tem and present th e greates t ri sk of infection. CRITICAL ITEMS MUST BE STERILE PRIOR TO USE. Scalpe l blades, hypoderm ic needles,  surgical instrum ents, and suture needles are examples of critical items. 1.22.5.2.  Semicritical  Items.  Semicritical items are ob jects that frequ ently con tact m ucous membranes and are often contam inated by oral  secretions and blood, but  they do not enter the tissue or vascular system. THESE ITEMS MUST HAVE HIGH TO INTERMEDIATE LEVEL DISINFECTION. Shade guides, facebows, jaw relationship records, im pressions, and prosthetic devices are examples of semicritical items. 1.22.5.3. Noncritical Items. Noncritical items are objects that don’t ordinarily contact mucous membranes or broken skin. THESE  ITEM S S HOULD HAVE INTE RMEDIATE TO LOW LEVEL DISINFECTION. Receiving areas, case pans, and articulators are exa mples of noncritical items. NOTE: The term “noncritical” does not imply “nonimportant.” 1.22.6.

Dispensing only those m aterials or  supplies required for treating a singlepatient (or prosthesis) is the unit dose method. 1.22.11.  Standard-Universal  Precautions. DHCWs  must assum e  all body fluids and contaminated instrum ents and  m aterials are infec tious and  routinely  u se standard ized inf ection control procedures. The use of st andard-universal precautions pr otects both the patient and the dental team.   1.23. Laboratory Barrier System: ea, a portion of the laboratory s1.23.1. Laboratory personnel can be protected against infection by the establishm ent of a strict barrier system. This is usually initiated by establishing a receiving area (a n engineering control) that is physically se parate from the rest of the dental labo ratory. If it is not  possible to create a physically separate receiving arhould be designated as the receiving area which would be considered con taminated. (The rest of the laboratory would beconsidered uncontaminated.) 1.23.2. All items needing disinfecting will first be processed through the receiving area (paragraph 1.24). This barrier system  is esse ntially a series of cleaning and disinfecti ng procedures that removes blood, saliva, and other pote ntially infectious material from the impression or prosthesis. After an item has passed through the barrier system , dental laboratory personnel m ay safely work on the case with minimum PPE. In practice, this means sterilizing or disinfecting dental items that have had contact with the patient before and af ter any labo ratory work is pe rformed (paragraphs 1.25 through 1.38). After a prosthesis has been through the barrier system, it can then be processed through the laboratory.   1.24. Receiving Area Requirements. Dental personnel w orking in th e receiving area should wear the appropriate PPE (gloves, mask, eye protection, and smocks). They should wash their hands as they enter and leave the receiving area. Dirty and clean cases m ust be separ ated. Every item with a po tential for contamination must not leave the receiv ing area until  is h as been clean ed and dis infected. Rush cases should not be allowed to break the infection control  barrier. The bench top must be disinfected between each case and at the end of the day with an intermediate disinfectant solution. 1.25. Disinfection of Reversible Hydrocolloid and Alginate Impressions: 1.25.1. After removal from the m outh, each impression  should be carefully rinsed with runnin g water in the dental treatment room before it is  transported to the receiving area. Small am ounts of dental stone m ay be sprinkled in the im pression and gently scrubbed into the im pression with  a camel hair brush. This addition of  the stone will aid in cleaning the impression. The im pression should then be gently rinsed under running water. After rinsing, the impression will be transported to the receiving area in a plastic bag. t 1.25.2. In the receiv ing area, the im pression will be  sprayed with an appropriate disinfectansolution and  placed  in a sealed plas tic b ag. Alg inate im pressions shou ld be dis infected with a spray because they will absorb m oisture if placed in a so lution. Sealing the impression in a plastic bag creates a “charged atm osphere” which enh ances disinfection. The most  accurate casts have been produ ced when the spray  an d plas tic bag t echnique was used to disinfect alginate and reversible hydrocolloid im pressions. Appropriate  disinfectant sprays include iodophors, sodium hypochlorite (1:10 solution), 2 percent glutaraldehyde, and chlorine dioxide products. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  35 1.25.3. After the recom mended ti me of disinfection,  the impression will ag ain b e gently rin sed under running water an d then pou red in the trad itional manner. Because reversible hydrocolloid and alginate i mpressions lose dim ensional accuracy as a function of time, they should be poured within 12 minutes after removal from the mouth. A  disinfectant should be  selected that produces an appropriate level of disinfection in as short a time as possible. 1.26.  Disinfection  of  Addition  Silicone  and  Polysulfide  Impressions. These impressions m ay be  managed like the hydrocolloid impressions (paragraph 1.25), or they may be immersed in an appropriate hospital lev el disinf ectant. ( EXCEPTION: These im pressions should not glutaraldehyde.) Immersion with any acceptable disinfectant will not adversely affect the accuracy of the impression or the surface detail of the resulting cast . The surface detail of the cast seems to be enhanced if these impressions are immersed in a 2 percent acidic glutaraldehyde disinfectant.  1.27. Disinfection of Polyether Impressions. Polyether impressions are  hydrophilic and should not be immersed in a disinfectant solution. These impressions are disinfected in the same manner as reversible hydrocolloid and alginate im pressions (paragraph 1.25). A chlorine-basdisinfectant time is recommended for these impressions. 1.28. Disinfection of Prostheses Entering the Laboratory:  ed disinfectant with a short  be imm ersed in neutral1.28.1. Carefully rinse fixed and removable prostheses under running water after removal from the mouth. This is the precleaning step. Then scrub the prosthesis with an antimicrobial soap and rinse it. This procedure can occur in the dental treatment room, professional work area, or the receiving area. If this cleaning step is performed in the dental treatment room, place the cleaned prosthesis in a plastic bag and take it to the receiving area. 1.28.2. In the receiving area, place the prosthesis in an ultrasonic cleane r with the appropriate cleaning solution. Place the cover o n the ultraso nic cleaner and clean th e prosthesis according to the manufacturer’s recommended time. Then immerse the prosthesis in an accepted tuberculocidal disinfectant. Exam ples of accepta ble dis infectants are s odium hypochlorite (1 :10 solution ), iodophors, and gluteradehyde. The immersion tim e is 10 m inutes or the m anufacturer’s specified time. Metal components of prostheses can be corroded by m any disinfectants, but this is unlikely to occur if proper disinfectant times are followed. 1.28.3. After the d isinfectant procedure is accomplished, the prosthesis will again be rins ed and can be processed through the labor atory. This procedure allows the  laboratory technician to work on the prosthesis with minimum PPE. 1.28.4. If the prosthesis  is to be shipped to anot her laboratory, the prosthes is will be disinfected and sealed in a plastic bag, which prevents contamination of the shipping m aterials. Also, a  statement should be included in th e shipping container st ating the prosthesis has been disinfected. NOTE: Disinfectant is not added to the plastic bag containing the prosthesis because the exposure time to the disinfectant will be excessive and may damage the prosthesis. 1.29.  Disinfection  and  Sterilization  of  Prosthodontic  Items. Dental equ ipment th at h as m inimal contact with  oral fluids will be clea ned and disinf ected with  an accepta ble disinfec tant. Exam ples of such items are shade tabs, dental torches, case p ans, articulators, facebows, spatulas, and rubber bowls. Equipment that has been placed in the patient’s mouth will be sterilized. Examples of such items are the facebow’s bitefork and reusable impression trays. 1.30. Dispensing the Finished Prosthesis to the Dentist. The prosth esis will be  cleaned, disinfected, and placed in a plastic bag  before it is r eturned to the  dentist. A statement m ay be affixed to the bag stating the prosthesis has been disinfected.  36  1.31. Preparation of Saturated Calcium Sulfate Dihydrate Solution (SDS). Prepare the SDS fro m fresh set stone that has never been poured against a potentially contaminated impression. 1.32. Disinfection of the Dental Casts: AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 before it is poured in dental stone. If the 1.32.1. Ideally, an im pression will be disinfected impression was poured before disinf ection, the subsequent cast will  be considered contam inated. Spraying the cast with an iodophor or a chlorine di sinfectant can disinfect the cast. The cast will then be placed upright and allowed to completely dry. Care must be taken not to damage the stone cast’s surface. 1.32.2. Another method is to place a 0.5 percent solu tion of sodium hypochlorite in a solution of  clear SDS and soak the cast for 30 m inutes. Th e cast will be rem oved from  the solution and allowed to dry com pletely. This so lution will not  dam age the surface of the cast. The solution must be prepared daily to maintain its effectiveness.  1.33.  Dental  Laboratory  Personnel  and  Standard  Universal  Precautions. A s a  mi nimum, t o minimize the possibility of contamination in the workplace, (1) PPE should be used when necessary, (2) excellent personal hygiene should be  maintained, (3) hepatitis B vaccination should be accom plished, (4) eating o r drinking s hould not b e perm itted in th e den tal labo ratory, and (5 ) the receiv ing and shipping area should be controlled.  1.33.1. Rush Cases. Do not allow rush cas es to jeopardize  the barrier system . If a prosthesis is adjusted or modified in the dental treatm ent room and additional laboratory support is required, make one of the following two choices:  1.33.1.1. Recognize that, depending on  the disinfectant, up to a  20-minute turnaround tim e is required to protect the dental laboratory.  1.33.1.2. Establish a unit dose polishing area physically  removed from the dental laboratory. In the isola ted are a in clude a po lishing unit,  in dividually wrapped wheels , abrasive points, and polishing agents. Enclose catch pa ns for pum ice in sealed p lastic bags for single patient use. Ensure all pum ice and polishing w heels used on c ontaminated appliances are sterilized after each use. 1.33.2. Hand Cleansing. Personnel involved with patient care  must follow the rigid handwashing regimine below: 1.33.2.1. Hands m ust be thoroughly wash ed and free of rings to rem ove resident bacteria and transient organisms acquired from contact with patients or contaminated surfaces. 1.33.2.2. Cleanse hands at the b eginning of each duty  day. Fingernails should be free of nail polish and trimmed and cleaned, using a nail clea ner. (DO NOT wear fals e fingernails because contamination may occur from fungal growth occurring between the false and natural nail.) 1.33.2.3. Wet hands, apply an antisep tic solution, and scrub hands  and nails with a surgical sponge or b rush. Rinse thoroughly  because so me antiseptic handcleansing agents may irritate the skin if they are not thoroughly removed. Finally, dry hands, using a clean paper towel. 1.33.2.4. Repeat handcleansing is required after wobefore lunch, and before leaving the dental clinic. rking with contam inated dental item s, 1.34. Chemical Sterilization and Disinfection: 1.34.1. Although heat sterilization is  the preferred m ethod, certain  instruments and m any dental materials cannot be placed in a heat sterilizer. Therefore, they re quire chem ical sterilization or  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  37 disinfection. Many different chem ical d isinfectants are availa ble with varying degrees of effectiveness. 1.34.2. It is im portant to rem ember that disinfec tants can be rendered ineffective by soiled or heavily contaminated prostheses. Therefore, adequate debridement and cleaning are necessary for effective disinfection. 1.34.3. The American Dental Association (ADA) Council on Dental Therapeutics recommends the following five disinfectants; iodophor (paragraph 1.35), glutaraldehyde (paragraph 1.36), phenolic (paragraph 1.37), chlorine (paragraph 1.38), and for maldehyde compounds. Form aldehyde compounds are usually used as surface or immersion disinfectants in dentistry. 1.35. Iodophor. Examples include Wescodyne® and Biocide®. 1.35.1. Iodophor compounds contain 0.05 to 1.6 percent  iodine and surface-active agents (usually that of detergents), which carry  and release free iodine. Because the antimicrobial activity of an iodophor compound is greater than iodine alone, it can be used as a chemical disinfectant. 1.35.2. Because the vapor pressure of iodine is reducedoffensive. Also, iodophors do not stain as readily as iodine. 1.35.3. Intermediate levels of disinfection can be  achieved after 10 to 30 m inutes of contact when mixed with water according to the manufacturer’s directions..  1.35.4.

W hen the proper amounts from each container are mixed, the solution is activated. 1.36.2.2. Glutaraldehyde sterilizati on cannot be verified by using sterilization m onitors. Because it is caustic to the ski n, forceps or rubb er gloves should be used to hand le prostheses that have been immersed in glutaraldehyde. A 2-percent, room-temperature solution of alkaline or neutral glutaraldehyde should be used to sterilize heat-sen sitive item s. (Read the manufacturer’s directions carefully because some formulations cannot be used on carbon-steel instruments.) 1.36.2.3.

They are not practical to use as su rface disinfectants becau se surfaces wiped down with g lutaraldehydes must have the residual disinfectant film wiped off with sterile water. 1.37.  Phenolic  Compounds. Synthetic phen olics have been accepted as disinfectants. In  high concentrations, phenolics are protoplasm ic poisons;  in lo w concentra tions, th ey inactivate e ssential enzyme system s. As disinfectants, p henolics are us ually combined with a detergent. Som e phenolic compounds have also been shown to be bactericidal, fungicidal, virucidal, and tuberculocidal. 1.38. Chlorine. Chlorine is available as sodium hypochlorite (common household bleach) or as chlorine dioxide. If improperly used, chlori ne-containing compounds can cause co rrosion of dental instrum ents and materials. 1.38.1. Sodium Hypochlorite. Sodium hypochlorite is thought to  oxidize microbial enzymes and cell-wall components. It is used as a chem ical disinfectant. A 10-percent solution (one part bleach to nine parts water) yields 10,000 parts per m illion of available ch lorine which achieves an intermediate level of disinfecti on in 30 m inutes. Because a sodium  hypochlorite solution tends to be unstable, a fresh solution must be prepared daily. This solution possesses a strong odor and can be harmful to eyes, skin, colored clothing, and metals. 1.38.2. Chlorine Dioxide. This new chemical sterilant has been approved by the EPA. onomical to use, and is nontoxic and 1.38.2.1. It contains no glutaraldehyde, is ecnonsensitizing. It is safe to use on most nonmetal items, but very corrosive to nonstainless steel metal instruments. 1.38.2.2. It requires an imm ersion time of 6 hours for sterilization. After activation, it has a shelf life of 14 days, but a reuse li fe of only 1 day. It is biodegra dable, does not stain hands or equipment, and does not have to be wiped off environmental surfaces. 1.38.2.3. If used within 24 hours of  preparation, it requires an immersion time of only 1 minute to achieve an interm ediate level of disinfecti on. However, if used 24 or m ore hours after its preparation, 3 minutes of immersion or wetting are required. 1.39. Ethylene Oxide. Ethylene oxide is the most reliable agent for chemical sterilization. It sterilizes objects that are heat stabile without producing rust or corrosion. 1.39.1. Like heat sterilization, it can be verified  with biological spore m onitors. Monitoring with the B subtilis spore should be performed with each sterilization cycle. 1.39.2. Certain disadvantages prohibit the routine us e of ethylene oxide in the dental laboratory. First, it is very slow acting, taking 4 to 6 hours to com plete  sterilization. In addition, certain sterilized item s retain ethylen e oxide gas so they m ust be  aerated for a m inimum of 12 hours  before they can be used in the oral cavity. Fi nally, there is som e concern about whether ethylene oxide vapors may be mutagenic and (or) carcinogenic. 1.39.3. Ethylene oxide must be used according to OSHA standards.  Chapter 2   DENTAL MATERIALS AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  39 Section 2A—Overview 2.1. Introduction. This chapter describes the com position, properties, and use of m aterials in a dental laboratory. Inform ation on the use of the m aterials is  also discussed in those chapters dealing with specific laboratory procedures. 2.2. Knowledge of Dental Materials: 2.2.1. Alm ost all dental m aterials are obtai ned from  a com mercial m anufacturer. Each manufacturer furnishes recom mendations for handli ng and storage of its product so the desired results are consistently obtained. The dental labor atory technician m ust know which m aterial is needed to do a good job, the way it is handled, how it reacts, and how it is stored to m aintain its physical properties. 2.2.2. Knowledge of m aterials is not only necessary to routinely perform  laboratory tasks successfully, but to evaluate a f ailure so it won’ t be repeated. A failure m eans wasted laboratory time, additional clinic time, and physical discomfort for the patient.  Section 2B—Gypsum Materials 2.3. Introduction. Gypsum is the common name for calcium sulfate dihydrate. 2.3.1. Gypsum products are more frequently used in laboratory procedures than any other group of compounds. Controlled variations in the m anufacture of gypsum products yield a group of dental materials that include plaster, dental stoneent, and soldering investment. 2.3.2. Each substance is a carefully form ulated pow der that has the particular com bination of physical properties to do a specific job. W hen th e prepared powder is m ixed with the proper amount of water, the blend initially form s a fluid pa ste that gradually hardens into a solid. In the fluid paste state, the mixture can be poured into molds or otherwise shaped. As gypsum sets, dense masses of crystals form  and heat is liberated. This liberation of heat, called an exotherm ic reaction, happens while all gypsum products are setting. , die stone, casting investm2.4. Physical Properties: (NOTE: See Table 2.1 for an analysis of  the physical properties of gypsum  materials.)  2.4.1.  Crushing  Strength. Crushing strength or com pressive strength is the m easure of the greatest am ount of com pressive force that can be applied to a substance without causing it to fracture. The strength of a gypsum  product increases rapidly as it hardens. Because the relative amount of water left in the set m aterial has a  distinct effect on strength, the following kinds of gypsum product strengths (wet and dry) are recognized: 2.4.1.1. Wet Strength. This is the strength of the material with excess water still present in the set up mass. 2.4.1.2.  Dry  Strength. This is the strength of a drie d gypsum specimen. Twenty-four hours after setting, the compressive strength of a gypsum specimen left to dry will double.  40  2.4.2. Setting Time. The setting tim e is the tim e required f or the m aterial to set or harden. It is divided into the following stages: AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 2.4.2.1. Initial Set. The tim e starts when the powder is m ixed with water and ends when the material becomes solid enough to remove from the tray and trim without distortion. 2.4.2.2. Final Set. This is the time required for full crystallization to occur. All exothermic heat dissipates and the mass reaches about half its potential crushing strength. Table 2.1.

Setting Expansion. A gypsum  product enlarges in volum e as it sets. This enlargem ent is called setting expansion and usually amounts to a fraction of 1 percent. A gypsum material sets up AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  in air or in contact with water. The setting material is exposed to (Table 2.1). expansion varies, depending on the conditions the 41 2.4.3.1. Normal Setting Expansion. A gypsum product expands predictably when it is allowed to solidif y unconf ined in a norm al room  tem perature environm ent. A setting expansion that takes place under these conditions is called normal setting expansion. 2.4.3.2.  Hygroscopic  Setting  Expansion. Hygroscopic setting expansion occurs when a gypsum material is allowed to solidify under wa ter. A hygroscopic expansion can be expected to more than double a norm al setting expansion.  In some dental procedures, a gypsum  product solidifies in lim ited contact with water. For exam ple, an investm ent is som etimes made to set against a wet ring liner. This expansion is great er than the norm al setting expansion, but it is not as great as a hygroscopic expansion. A setting expansion that occurs as a result of lim ited contact with water is called semihygroscopic expansion. 2.4.3.3. Thermal Expansion. This kind of expansion occurs as the result of a gypsum  product being heated. The amount of thermal expansion is proportional to the temperature. 2.5. Effect of Selected Variables on Crushing Strength. The strength of set gypsum  products can be directly affected by several variables under the control of the technician: 2.5.1.  Water-Powder  Ratio. The crushing strength lowers as m ore water is used in the m ix. Gypsum products are porous, and the greater am ount of water increases porosity because there will be fewer crystals formed per unit of volume of the material. 2.5.2. Mechanical Mixing. Longer and more rapid mixing, up to a maximum of 1 minute, results in greater strength. However, overm ixing break s down the form ing crystals and reduces the crushing strength of the end product. 2.5.3.  Chemical  Modifiers. In general, chem ical modifiers reduce crushing strength. However, borax can act to increase the surface hardness of the material. 2.6.  Effect  of  Selected  Variables  on  Setting  Time. The setting tim e of a gypsum  product can be affected directly by certain variables the dental tec hnician can control. These variables m ust be applied with extreme care. In gaining a m ore desirable setting time, other physical properties, such as strength, may be adversely affected as follows: 2.6.1.  Water-Powder  Ratio. A longer setting tim e is required wh en more water is used in the mix. Conversely, the setting time is reduced when less water is used in the mix. 2.6.2. Water Temperature. As the tem perature of the water used  in the m ix is raised f rom 32 to 85 oF, the setting tim e is shortened. W hen the water is between 85 and 120  oF, the setting tim e is the mixture is m aintained at about 212  oF, the m aterial lengthened. If boiling water is used and will not set at all. 2.6.3.  Mixing. The setting tim e is shortened as the m ixture is stirred (spatulated) either f or a longer time or at a faster rate. 2.6.4. Accelerators and Retarders: 2.6.4.1. An  accelerator is a substance that, when added to a gypsum  product, decreases the setting tim e. Conversely, a  retarder  increases the setting tim e. The m anufacturer uses these substances to standardize the setting behavior of  a product. At tim es, accelerators or retarders may be used to alter the usual setting behavior of a product. 42  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 portant in  these m aterials. Manipulating the water 2.6.4.2. Potassium sulfate and com mon table salt are  accelerators; vinegar, potassium  citrate, and borax are retarders. 2.6.4.3. Unfortunately, accelerators and retarders also change properties other than setting time, and they tend to reduce both setting expansion and crushing strength. For this reason, chem ical accelerators or retarders should never be used w ith casting or soldering investm ents because a predictable setting expansion is imtemperature, mixing time, and mixing rate are safer ways of controlling setting tim e than using chemicals. 2.6.4.4. There are a few laboratory pr ocedures where using a specific accelerator is acceptable. One outstanding exam ple is when slurry water ismixes in cast m ounting procedures.  Slurry  water  is a concentrated suspension of gypsum  particles in water m ade by catching the runoff  from a cast trim ming machine. The suspended gypsum particles are allowed to settle, and about  two-thirds of the water is siphoned away. The object is to develop a m ore highly concentrat ed suspension when the sedim entary calcium  sulfate dehydrate particles are reagitated. Each of  these calcium sulfate dehydrate particles acts as a center of crystalline formation. 2.6.4.5. Depending on the concentration of the suspension, you can expect m uch shorter setting times when you use slurry water than when you use plain water.  used to accelerate plaster or dental stone 2.7.  Effect  of  Water-Powder  Ratio  and  Mixing  Time  on  Setting  Expansion. The m anufacturer strictly controls the setting expansion of a gypsum  product by using a carefully m easured amount of chemical modifiers. The m anufacturer recommends standard proportioning and m ixing procedures that make physical properties, including setting expansion,  predictable. In the case of investm ents, setting expansion is such a sensitive f actor that deviating  from the m anufacturer’s directions is a questionable practice. Always be aware that a num ber of gypsum’s properties are interdependent. For exam ple, steps taken to change setting time can also alter setting expansion. If there is good reason to change a gypsum material’s normal setting expansion, follow these guidelines: 2.7.1. Thick mixes (less water) tend to result in increased setting expansion and vice versa. 2.7.2. Long mixing times tend to increase setting expansion and vice versa. 2.8. Modeling Plaster: 2.8.1. Manufacturing Process:  crystals. Each crystal contains a definite 2.8.1.1. Gypsum  is converted into m odel plaster  by grinding it into sm all particles and then heating it slowly in open vats to drive off the water of hydration. Under a microscope, the plaster is seen to be m ade up of rough irregularproportion of water. This is called water of crystallization or water of hydration. The amount of water eliminated by heating has a bearing on the be havior of the plaster when it is again m ixed with water in the laboratory. 2.8.1.2. A special process is used to ensure plaster made for dental use has suitable working properties. These properties m ust always be uni form throughout a batch of m aterial and from  one batch to another. 2.8.1.3. One of the m ost important requirements of pl aster is that it m ust set or harden within definite time limits. The am ount of setting expansion m ust also be from  0.2 to 0.3 percent. A setting expansion of 0.3 percent is the m aximum amount allowed by the Am erican National Standards Institute (ANSI) of the ADA’s Specification Number 25 for model plaster. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  43 2.8.2.  Model  Plaster’s  Uses. Model plaster has m any uses in constructing a matrix, flasking a denture, attaching cas ts to an articulator, and as an ingredient in some investments. The initial setting tim e for most dental plasters is f rom 4 to 12 m inutes. The final setting time is approximately 20 to 45 minutes. the laboratory. It is used for 2.9. Impression Plaster. This is a plaster that has been specially com pounded for making impressions of the mouth, as follows: 2.9.1. Impression plaster must behave differently than m odel plaster. It m ust be able to set m uch faster to reduce the tim e it is held in the pa tient’s mouth. Because a plaster im pression cannot spring around an undercut as it is withdrawn from  the mouth, it m ust be broken into pieces and reassembled outside the mouth. For this reason, it must be weak and brittle. 2.9.2. Impression plasters are rarely used in dentis try today due to the availability of hydrocollids and elastomers. Impression plaster must have a very low setting expansion of 0.13 percent because an impression that changes size significantly is  inaccurate. Various accelerators and retarders are added to control the setting tim e of plaster, and coloring agents are often added to distinguish one gypsum product from another. 2.9.3. Today, im pression plaster is m ainly used to  obtain bite registrations for dentures or orienting a fixed partial denture in the mouth for a solder index. 2.10. Dental Stone: 2.10.1. Dental stone is medium strength plaster that is stronger and more resistant to abrasion. It is used primarily for casts (such as diagnostic casts), opposing arch casts, and com plete and partial denture working casts. 2.10.2. Dental stone is made by autoclaving the gypsum under pressure and then grinding it into a hemihydrate powder. The particles are more prismatic and regular in shape. For this reason, dental stone requires less water in mixing and sets more slowly. When set, it is harder, much more dense, and has a higher crushing strength than mexpansion is approximately 0.12 percent. 2.10.3. The m anufacturer colors dental stone to m ake it easy to distinguish from  plaster. The initial setting tim e of a typical dental stone produc t is from  8 to 15 m inutes. The final set takes approximately 45 minutes. odel  or im pression plaster. The average setting 2.11. Die Stone (Improved Stones): 2.11.1. Improved stones are specially processed form s of gypsum  products used to m ake crown, onlay, and inlay dies. They are harder, m ore  dense than dental stone, and have a 0.08 to 0.18 percent setting expansion. They are also colored to distinguish them from plaster. 2.11.2. Because the am ount of setting expansion is  critical, it is im portant to use the water-to-powder ratio the manufacturer recommends. These high strength plasters are made by first boiling the gypsum in a 30-percent calcium  chloride solution before autoclaving and then grinding the stone into very fine particles. Some manufacturers use a 1 percent solution of sodium succinate, or they add resin particles to increase the hardness of the stone. 2.12.  Investment  Materials. Investm ents are products used to form  m olds for m olten m etal and to relate pieces of metal to one another prior to sold ering. Investments are composed of a refractory (heat-resistant) substance, like cristobalite or quartz,  and a binder. Com mon binders are gypsum , phosphate, and silicate com pounds. As a result, investm ents are often described as gypsum , phosphate, or silicate bound. 44  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 ent expand m ore than those with a high heat without decom posing. Depending on the 2.12.1. Investm ents with a high cristobalite contpercentage of quartz. Depending on what m etal is  to be used, som e casting investm ents need significant expansion to compensate for metal shrinkage, and their refractory com ponent needs to contain a higher am ount of cristobalite. W hen low  expansion is required (such as for soldering investments), the refractory component will be high in quartz. 2.12.2. Investm ents are supposed to withstand binder, they become more or less able to resist heat-induced breakdown. 2.12.3. Overheated, gypsum -bound investments liberate  sulfur dioxide which m akes the casting brittle. To m inimize sulfur dioxide liberation, gypsum -bonded investm ent m olds are oF. Also, m olten m etals thrown (cast) into those m olds recommended to burn out below 1300 should have casting temperatures below 1950 oF. 2.12.4. The com pany that produces Ticonium   chrome alloy m akes a special gypsum -bound investment that withstands a 1350  oF burnout tem perature and a casting tem perature of 2600  oF. Barring this kind of exception, phosphate and sili cate bound investments have excellent high heat resistance and are com monly used when cas ting or soldering tem peratures exceed 1950  oF. Some more recent investm ents can be used as “all-bound makeup and use burnout temperatures of 1500 to 1600 oF. purpose” investm ents. They have a high silicate 2.13. Inlay Investment: 2.13.1. Inlay investm ents are usually gypsum  bound.  Inlay investments are com monly used for investing many different kinds of fixed restorations cast in conventional golds. 2.13.2. When molten gold alloy is cast into a m old, it cools and solidifies. As it cools, it shrinks. The amount of shrinkage is approxim ately 1.4 (±  0.2) percent. If nothing is done to com pensate for this shrinkage, the casting will be too sm all. The m old space m ust be enlarged so the m olten metal is cast into a space that is 1.4 percent oversize. As the m olten metal solidifies and shrinks, the casting attains the correct size. 2.13.3. Techniques have been devised to use setting and therm al expansion characteristics of investments to compensate for cast metal shrinkage. In one technique, high heat (1290  oF) is used to produce the m ajority of the required expaexpansion of the investment is responsible for most of the compensation. 2.13.4. Inlay investments tend to fall into two br oad categories depending on how they are used--high heat technique investm ents (above 1300  oF) and low heat tec hnique investments (1300  oF or hygroscopic less). One type of low heat technique is used with a high water content called a technique. This technique creates additional expansion at a lower temperature burnout. nsion. In another technique, the hygroscopic 2.14. Soldering Investment: 2.14.1. A soldering investm ent is sim ilar in com position to a casting investm ent with a quartz refractory. An investment with a quartz refractory expands less than one having cristobalite as the heat resistant component. 2.14.2. Minim al norm al setting expansion is a desira ble soldering investm ent characteristic. A soldering investment does not expand nearly e nough to com pensate for the shrinkage of m olten gold and should not be used for casting purposes. Li ke casting investments, soldering investments are made with gypsum  or high heat binders. The h eat resistance of the binder is m atched to the anticipated soldering tem perature. As a rule ofabove 1950 oF requires an investment with a high heat binder.  thum b, a soldering procedure that takes place AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  2.15. Investments for Chrome Alloys: 45 2.15.1. High-Heat, Chrome-Alloy Investment. A high-heat, chrome-alloy investment is made to withstand a much higher heat than the 1300  oF normally used in eliminating wax for casting gold. Such an investm ent consists of a quartz powder  mixed with an ethyl silicate liquid and is used with the high melting range of chrome alloys (2700 to 2800 oF). 2.15.2. Low-Heat, Chrome-Alloy Investment: 2.15.2.1. A low-heat, chrom e-alloy investm ent  is gypsum  bound and has a silica refractory component. It is sim ilar to the investm ent  used for casting gold. A low-heat, chrom e-alloy investment is used as part of the system for producing Ticonium  chrom e alloy castings. Ticonium metal is used throughout the Air Force Dental Service for RPD frameworks. 2.15.2.2. The burnout tem perature of ticonium  investment molds is 1350  oF, and the casting temperature of ticonium metal is 2500 to 2600 oF.  2.15.2.3. There is a sulfur dioxide liberation problem  associated with gypsum  bound investments at high burnout or casting tem peratures. One way to com bat this problem  is to increase the percentage of refractory m aterial relative to the gypsum  binder in an investm ent formula. Ticonium  m etal shrinks 1.7 percent as it solidifies. The investm ent and burnout techniques are balanced to furnish that amount of expansion in the mold. 2.16. Investments for Ceramic Gold Alloys: 2.16.1. Gypsum-bonded investments are not adequate  for casting ceramic golds. The expansion is not high enough, and the gypsum  decomposes under  the high tem peratures. Instead, investm ents containing magnesium oxide and soluble phosphate should be used. 2.16.2. The dissolved phosphate reacts with m agnesium oxide to form  a m atrix of m agnesium phosphate which binds silica particles together m uch the sam e as gypsum  binds low heat investments. Phosphate-bound investm ents are coarse  in particle size, heat resistant, strong, and sometimes difficult to rem ove from castings. The i nvestment is sluggish and sets rather rapidly with a working tim e of  3 to 4  minutes. All-purpose investm ents have a sm aller particle size; therefore, a smoother casting can be made. 2.17. Rules for Handling Gypsum Materials: 2.17.1. Use Clean Equipment. Always use a clean m ixing bowl and spatula. Hardened particles left in the bowl from a previous mix alter the setting time and weaken the material. As little as 0.1 percent of the hardened particles in a mix of casting investment reduces the setting time and alters the therm al or hygroscopic expansion. The best plaster is still soft and easy to remove. 2.17.2.  Tumble  the  Contents. Tum bling helps ensure an even distribution of the investmconstituents. 2.17.3. Add the Powder to the Water. The powder is always added to the water; the water is never added to the powder. Place the required am ount of water into the bowl and then sift the powder into the water until the powder form s an island. The powder gradually absorbs the water; consequently, the mixture is free of lum ps and ai r. Because tap water contains contam inants, use only distilled water. time to clean a bowl and spatula is while the ent 46  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 2.17.4.  Measure  the  Water  and  Weigh  the  Powder. To ensure the properties of any gypsum  product are m aintained, an accurate water-to-pow der ratio m ust be obtained. W eigh the powder and measure the volume of water before mixing the gypsum material. 2.17.5. Mix Well. Ensure all powder is spatulated into the water. As m ixing proceeds, the water and powder form  a m ixture of cream y consistency.  (To avoid excessive incorporation of air into the mix, do not whip the mix.) 2.17.6.  Vacuum-Mix  the  Materials. Phosphate-bound investm ents release am monia gas when mixing. Vacuum-mixing removes gas and air from  the mix. Avoid gas entrapment by holding the mix under vacuum for 30 seconds. (Gas entrapment in the mold results in nodules on the casting.) 2.17.7. Never Add to a Mix. Adding to a mix interferes with the setting mechanism and results in a weak and distorted product. It is better to begin a new mix. 2.17.8.  Use  Good  Equipment. A scarred or cracked plaster bowl allows mmaterial to lodge in the cracks. These particles could contaminate and spoil the mix. 2.17.9. Do Not Contaminate the Material. Never allow water or other contaminants to fall into a bin containing gypsum material. One drop of water can adversely affect the entire batch. 2.17.10.  Know  the  Material. An aged investm ent can ruin a piece of work. Be aware that investments have batch numbers and expiration dates stamped on them. Contact the manufacturer if any problem s are suspected with your inveinvestments rotated, with the oldest packs being used first. stments. Another good practice is to keep inute particles of 2.18. Storing Gypsum Materials: 2.18.1. Improper Storage:   it absorbs water. The water m ay alter its 2.18.1.1. When gypsum material is exposed to air,working qualities and m ake it unfit for use. W hen plaster or stone is exposed to air for a short period of tim e, it sets faster than usual. If it is exposed for a longer period, it m ay set very slowly and be weak when it’s set. 2.18.1.2. A prolonged period of storage in an unsealed container m ay alter the physical properties of casting investm ents, greatly ch anging the setting tim e, setting expansion, and reducing the crushing strength. 2.18.1.3. The setting tim e of casting and soldering i nvestments is listed on the container along with the physical properties expected when the recom mended powder to water ratios are used. This data is based on fresh material as it leaves the factory. It does not apply to aged batches of material that have been improperly stored. 2.18.1.4. If an investm ent takes an unusually long time to reach an initial set (m ore than 20 minutes), the entire batch m ust be discarded.  A prolonged setting tim e is a warning that som e or all of the desirable physical properties m ay ha ve been lost or so altered as to render the investment unfit for use. 2.18.2. Proper Storage: 2.18.2.1. Gypsum  m aterial m ust be properly store d. The storage problem  is m ore acute in a humid climate than in a dry one. All gypsum  products must be stored in a sealed container in a dry room. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  47 2.18.2.2. A systematic plan for withdrawing older  stock from the supply room  should be used. To minimize prolonged periods of storage, larg e quantities m ust not be stockpiled due to the danger of deterioration. 2.18.2.3. Some authorities also recommend that still another factor be taken into account when casting investm ents are stored. The heavier constituents (for exam ple, quartz) settle to the bottom of the container, thereby altering the wo rking properties of the investm ent. Therefore, investments should be tum bled before use, either m echanically or by hand, to m ake sure the powder is evenly mixed throughout. 2.19. Proper Handling of Plaster and Dental Stone Casts: 2.19.1. Erosion of Casts:  with water because hardened stone is 2.19.1.1. A well-poured cast can be ruined by contactsoluble in water in a ratio equal to or less than 1 part stone to 500 parts of water. W hen a stone cast is im mersed in water, an erosion proce ss begins im mediately on the surface of the stone. The erosion is noticeable in as short a period as 10 mlaboratory by suspending a stone cast in water so pa rt of the cast is submerged, while part of it remains out of  the water. In 10 m inutes, the er osion of  the subm erged part will be evident because of its pitted appearance. 2.19.1.2. The tim e necessary to produce a noticeable  effect depends on the m ineral content of the water, temperature of the water, and density of the stone. A poured impression should never be submerged in tap water because of the harmful effect it has on stone.  inutes. This can be shown in the 2.19.2. Saturated Calcium Sulfate Dihydrate Solution (SDS) Preparation: 2.19.2.1. SDS is a clear, true solution of water  and a maximum amount of dissolved dihydrate (set) gypsum  product. Cast surfaces exposed to  SDS do not erode nearly as m uch as cast surfaces bathed in tap water. If a cast must be soaked for more than 1 or 2 minutes, SDS should be used. 2.19.2.2. SDS is m ade by im mersing fragments of  gypsum casts in water for about 5 days. A saturated solution consists of about 0.2 grams of dehydrate in 100 cc of water. 2.19.2.3. If a slurry water suspension is left to se ttle out for 3 to 4 days, the clear fluid above the sediment is SDS. For use, siphon off the SD S into another container without agitating the sediment layer. 2.19.2.4. SDS can be made from plaster, dental stone, or gypsum bound investment, whichever is best suited for the kind of cast you expect to wet. 2.19.3. Wetting Casts: 2.19.3.1. Occasionally, casts require quick superfsurfaces). SDS must be used instead of tap water for this purpose. 2.19.3.2. When a cast is shaped on a cast trim mer, gypsum slurry splashes onto its surface. If this slush layer is allowed to dry, it is hard to rem ove and cast dam age could occur. As the slurry buildup accumulates, rinse the cast in a su itable container of SDS to rem ove the slurry. The SDS must be changed often or it will also turn into concentrated gypsum slurry. icial wetting (for exam ple, cleansing cast 48  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 2.19.3.3. When outright cast soaking m ust be done in conjunction with a laboratory procedure, the cast m ust not be com pletely submerged in SDS. Total im mersion slows down the soaking process because air trapped in the cast cannot r eadily escape. Instead, the fluid level should be maintained below the tissue surface of the cast. A cast can be moistened in this manner in 20 to 30 minutes. 2.19.3.4. The wetting process can be seen gradually wo rking up from the base of the cast to the tips of the teeth, m uch the sam e as oil dam pens the wick in a lam p. If relief wax has been placed on the cast, there is danger of the escaping air from  the cast lifting the wax from  the stone. Instead of setting the cast on its base, set it on its end in the SDS.  Section 2C—Dental Waxes 2.20. General Information: 2.20.1. Wax compounds used in dentistry are m ixtures of individual waxes of natural or synthetic origin. As with all other dental m aterials, each co mponent in the m ixture is selected to give the specific properties best suited for the proce dure being perform ed. Depending on the purpose the wax serves, modifiers are included to change the melting range, increase or decrease stickiness, or impart a distinguishing color. 2.20.2. Dental waxes are supplied in various shapfamiliar with their uses and m anipulation and be  prepared f or variations in the behavior ofdifferent waxes supplied by manufacturers. 2.20.3.

Flows easily, sticks to a cast well, cuts cleanly. Use at around 290 oF.  2.21.  Groups  of  Waxes.  Most dental waxes fall generally in to three functional groups; im pression, pattern, or processing, as follows: 2.21.1. Impression Waxes. These waxes are used prim arily by the dentist at the chair. They have low melting points and flow fairly easily at m outh temperatures. They can be distorted very easily and require extreme care in handling. Exam ples of impression waxes are corrective wax and jaw movement recording wax. 2.21.2. Pattern Waxes. These waxes are used by the dentist and laboratory technician. (paragraph 2.23), baseplate wax (paragraph 2.22), 2.21.2.1. They are used to form  the m olds in  which prosthodontic restorations are m ade. Examples of pattern waxes are inlay wax wire wax (paragraph 2.25.1), preform ed wa x (paragraph 2.25.1), and sheet-casting wax (paragraph 2.25.3). With the notable exception of inlay wax, almost all of the pattern waxes are meant to be used in controlled thicknesses. 2.21.2.2. Gauge (ga) is a m easure of thickness. The term  is applied to the diam eters of metal wires and wax form s having circular and sem icircular cross sections (for exam ple, wire wax). Gauge is also used when talking about sheet metal and sheet wax thicknesses. 2.21.2.3. Unfortunately, m anufacturers don’t always us e the sam e gauge standard. Even if the discussion is limited to wax, the thickness of wax shapes with the sam e gauge number can vary between two manufacturers. Table 2.3 shows a por tion of the Brown and Sharpe Gauge Scale for nonferrous (non-iron containing) sheets and wire. Notice that as gauge numbers get smaller, the thickness increases.  Table 2.3.

Baseplate Wax: 2.22.1.  Composition. Baseplate wax is com posed m ainly of beeswax, paraffin, and coloring matter. The ingredients are melted together, cast into blocks, and then rolled into sheets. A typical baseplate wax m ight contain 50  parts of yellow beeswax, 6 parts of gum  m astic, 3 parts of prepared chalk, and 4 parts of vermilion. 2.22.2.  Requirements. There are several requirem ents for  a baseplate wax. The wax m ust be fairly rigid at mouth temperature under biting pressure. It must be capable of holding porcelain or acrylic teeth in position, but m ust not be brittle.  The wax should m aintain a uniform consistency throughout a normal range of room temperatures as well as at mouth temperature. 2.22.3.  Types.  Baseplate wax is supplied in two types, hard and mindicated for warmer climates because it resists flow at higher temperatures. At cold temperatures, it m ight be too brittle and have a tendency to crack. The medium wax is indicated f or low temperatures, but might exhibit too much flow in a warmer environment. 2.22.4. Uses. Baseplate wax is used for occlusion rim s, as a boxing for m atrices, for filling the tongue space of lower im pressions, in com plete and partial denture waxups, and for many miscellaneous purposes. Most baseplate wax sheets are about 1 m illimeter (mm) (18 gauge [ga]) thick. edium. The hard wax is 2.23. Inlay Wax: 2.23.1. General Composition. Inlay wax consists of paraffin  (to make up the bulk); gum dammar (to im prove the sm oothness in m olding and to re nder the wax m ore resistant to flaking and cracking); and carnuba (to control the softening point and hardness of the wax). 2.23.2.  Requirements  for  Use  in  Dental  Procedures. Inlay wax is one of the m ost carefully compounded of all the dental waxes. It should have the following qualities: high accuracy in reproducing every detail of a cavity or crown preparation; ease of carvi ng without chipping or flaking; workable in the m outh at body tem perature and in the laboratory at room  temperature; dimensionally stable when transferred from  one tem perature environm ent to another; strong enough in thin areas to withstand the ordinary stre sses of investing; and finally, the ability to burn out cleanly from the mold at ordinary burnout temperatures without leaving a solid residue. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  51 2.23.3. Types of Inlay Wax. There are three types of inlay wax—Type A, a hard or low flow wax used in some indirect methods; Type B, for the direct technique of pattern making or intraoral use; and Type C, for the indirect technique or laboratory use. 2.24.  Ivory  (or  White)  Wax. Ivory or white wax is an inlay waespecially useful for waxing acrylic jacket patterns.mold which might discolor the resin of the jacket crown. 2.25. Casting Waxes for Partial Dentures: x containing no color pigm ent. It is  It does not leave a colored residue in the plaster 2.25.1. Preformed Wax (Round and Half-Round Cross Section). Preformed wax is supplied by the manufacturer in a variety of shapes and sizes  suitable for use in constructing the wax pattern for a partial denture framework. Some of the round forms (wire wax) can also be used for spruing fixed prosthetic units. 2.25.2. Inlay Wax. When waxing frameworks, inlay wax is prim arily used to free flow and carve those parts of the pattern that join preform ed components to each other. Inlay wax is also used to sprue patterns. 2.25.3. Sheet-Casting Wax. Sheet-casting wax is very sim ilar to baseplate wax (paragraph 2.22). At room temperature, sheet-casting wax possesses the properties of toughness and pliability and sufficient tackiness to adhere to the cast and stay where it is placed. 2.25.3.1. Gauge. Sheet-casting wax is m anufactured in several thicknesses or gauge. The m ost common sizes are 24, 26, 28, and 30 gauge. 2.25.3.2. Color. Although manufacturers supply the wax sheet s in several colors to distinguish waxes of different consistencies and handling chcolors among manufacturers. For example, one brand of green wax may be entirely different in working properties from the green wax of another manufacturer. 2.25.3.3. Uses. Sheet-casting wax can be used when a de finite thickness of wax is needed. Its principal use is with RPD work to provide relief  of the residual ridge on the m aster cast. It is often combined with one thickness of baseplate wax to produce a palate of uniform thickness in a complete denture. aracteristics, there is no standardization of together the structural parts of a wrought wire clasp while it is 2.26. Sticky Wax. Sticky wax is com posed of beeswax, para ffin, and a considerable am ount of natural resin. The resin gives the wax its adhesiveness and hardness. An important property of sticky wax is that it breaks under pressure instead of bending or distorting. This property m akes it useful for joining the parts of a broken denture or holding invested for soldering. 2.27. Utility Wax. Utility wax is an extrem ely pliable wax that  is marketed in rope f orm. It is plastic and som ewhat tacky at room  tem perature, which  makes it usable without heating. Most im portantly, utility wax is used for beading im pressions before pouring the cast. It is som etimes used in im pression techniques before pouring the cast to build up the impression tray borders. 2.28. Boxing Wax. Boxing wax is a specially prepared wax, supplied in strips 1 1/2 inches wide by 12 inches long. It is primarily used to box impressions. Most boxing waxes do not require heating; they are pliable enough at room temperature to be formed into desired shapes. 2.29.  Low-Fusing  Impression  Wax. Low fusing im pression wax is specially com pounded to flow under controlled pressure in the m outh. It is m elted in a water bath and painted on the tissue surface of an individual impression tray as a corrective liner  for final complete and RPD impressions. Because the ties that allow it to be built up AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 52  wax is easily distorted, low-fusing wa x impressions must be handled with the utmost care. Fingers must never touch the tissue side of the im pression, including the periphery. W hen the impression is rinsed, a gentle stream of room temperature water should be use d. A separator is not necessary when the cast is poured. 2.30.  Undercut  (Blockout)  Wax. Undercut wax has physical properaround an abutm ent tooth and then easily carved w ith surveying tools. Undercut wax is m ade by combining beeswax, resin, and kaolin. It is usually  supplied in sm all, wide-mouthed jars. The form ula for making this kind of wax is shown in Chapter 8, paragraph 8.42.1.4.1. 2.31. Disclosing Wax. Disclosing wax has a very low fusing ra nge. It flows readily under pressure and is used to detect points of unequal pressure when seating m any kinds of castings. Disclosing wax is melted on the tissue side of a casting and then heldpressure points and discloses them for corrections. 2.32. Beeswax. Refined beeswax is supplied in cakes or bars. It is used in m olten form (280 to 300  oF) as a dip for sealing refractory casts. To prevent cracking, casts m ust be heated and dehydrated before they are dipped. Subsequent sealing of refractory cas ts provides a satisfactory surface for attaching wax and plastic patterns, and prevents absorption of moisture when invested for casting RPD frames.  Section 2D—Impression Materials 2.33. Introduction:  in place under pressure. It flows away from  the 2.33.1. A variety of im pressions are made in the dent al clinic. Each variety requires a m aterial of slightly different properties. In com plete dentur e work, a m aterial is needed that accurately registers all the denture-bearing areas. In partial  denture work, there is an additional requirem ent. The material must be capable of registering bot h tooth and soft tissue undercuts. In m any dental impression procedures, two m aterials and som etimes even three are used in sequence to take advantage of the most favorable qualities of each. 2.33.2. A useful table of impression materials is shown in Table 2.4.  Table 2.4. Types of Impression Materials.

Impression compound is a material that can be softened by heat into a soft plastic mass and then hardened by cooling it with either a stream  of  cold water or a blast of  air. It is used in the clinic for prelim inary impressions, to m ake custom impression trays, and to m odify stock trays. Because it does not accurately spring around an undeer shape, impression compound has very limited use in partial denture work. 2.34.2. Although im pression com pound is a basic m aterial in the clinical phases of prosthetic dentistry, it is not often used in the laboratory.  The laboratory technician uses it periodically to attach a cast to its mounting in an articulator.  2.34.3. Impression compound is marketed in several colors and designated by the manufacturer as high, medium, or low fusing. However, there is  no uniformity among manufacturers as to exactly what constitutes high or low fusing. One brand  of “high-fusing” impression compound may have about the sam e fusing range as another brand la beled “medium-fusing,” and the two m ay be the same or different colors. In general, high-fusing impression compounds flow at approximately 135 to 140  oF while low-fusing types m ay flow at 115  oF. Several of the m anufacturers make a “tray” compound which is high fusing (about 140 oF). It is almost always black in color and is the type of impression compound most suitable for a custom impression tray. 2.34.4. Im pression com pound is one of the few im pression m aterials an am algam die can be packed against. Any of the gypsum  materials can be poured into a com pound impression without the need of a separator. The material is supplied in the form of cakes and sticks. 2.35. Low-Fusing Impression Wax: 2.35.1. Low-fusing im pression wax is specially form ulated to flow under controlled pressure in the mouth. It is melted in a water bath and painte d in an individual impression tray as a corrective liner for final impressions. It is also used for reline impressions for complete dentures and RPDs. 2.35.2. Low-fusing wax impressions must be handled with extreme care in the laboratory because the wax is so easily distorted. Fingers must never touch the tissue side of the impression, including the periphery. If an im pression is rinsed, it shoul d be done very carefully with room -temperature water. A separator is not necessary when a cast is poured. 54  2.36. Impression Paste: AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 2.36.1. Impression paste is usually supplied as two  separate components, a base and a hardener. The base and hardener are mixed together in specific proportions to form a paste. Impression paste is rigid when it sets, and it does not spring over unde rcuts. Its principal ingredients are zinc oxide and eugenol or lauric acid. Im pression paste is used  primarily as a corrective m aterial inside an individual impression tray. 2.36.2. One use of im pression paste is to reline im pressions for both com plete and RPDs. Occasionally, it is used in im mediate denture work  as a lining for a sectional im pression. It can also be used to provide a lining for a com plete denture record base to m ake it fit the cast and the mouth more accurately. A separator is not require d when the cast is poured into an im pression made with this material. 2.37.  Elastomeric  Impression  Materials.  These m aterials are supplied as two-part system s; a base paste and an accelerator paste. Some manufacturers supply the accelerator as a liquid. When the two are mixed in the correct proportions, the resulting m ixture polym erizes into a rubbery state. Elastom eric materials are not reversible and can be used only on ce. They are used prim arily for fixed prosthodontic units (crowns or onlays), although they can also be used as corrective liners in com plete denture impressions and RPD bases. Pastes and accelerators from  different brands of elastomeric materials must never be cross-mixed. Materials must be carefully handled because the stains that some of them produce on contact with clothing and towels are im possible  to rem ove. Four different types of elastom eric impression m aterials are available; polysulffollows: ides,  silicones, polyvinylsiloxanes, and polyethers, as 2.37.1.  Polysulfides. The basic ingredient of a polysulfiderubber with various fillers, pigm ents, and m odifiers. The polysulfides are easily recognized because one of the two pastes is usually dark and the other paste is white in color. This m aterial has a very characteristic odor. The polysulfides are m ore com monly known as  rubber  base or polysulfide  rubber base im pression m aterial. The low viscosity of this m aterial allows accurate registration of the soft and hard tissues. It is most often used in removable prosthodontics. 2.37.2. Silicones (Condensation Reaction Silicones):  im pression m aterial is polysulfide 2.37.2.1. Silicone im pression m aterial consists of  silicone and ethyl silicate. This m aterial exhibits significant setting shrinkage and should be used in thin consistent layers. 2.37.2.2. Silicone m anufacturers were the first to  offer a two-phase im pression method. The dentist first makes an impression, either in the m outh or on the diagnostic cast, of the patient’s arch, using a stock im pression tray and a putty  f orm of  the silicone m aterial. The resulting custom-fitted tray is used to carry a wash of  the lower viscosity silicone m aterial to the m outh for the final impression.  2.37.2.3. Silicone m aterials are generally lighter in  color and translucent when set, and they have a much more subdued odor than the polysulfi des. A disadvantage is that shrinkage occurs if the material is allowed to sit for more than 30 minutes before pouring the impression. 2.37.3.  Polyvinylsiloxanes  (Addition  Reaction  Silicones). Polyvinylsiloxanes are like the they differ in chem ical structure and reactions. conventional silicones in their elastic nature, but Because of this, the polym erization shrinkage of polyvinylsiloxanes is well controlled, and a thin uniform thickness of the m aterial is not so si gnificant a requirem ent for accurate im pressions. Polyvinylsiloxanes are also used with a two-strigidity and cost of the material. age im pression technique. A disadvantage is the AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  55 2.37.4.  Polyethers. The base of this im pression m aterial is a polyether com pound, and the accelerator is a sulfonic acid. Laboratory studiespolysiloxanes, are the m ost accurate of the elasto meric impression materials. However, when set, polyether impression material is very stiff, m aking it difficult to rem ove the impression tray from the mouth if large tooth undercuts are present. This is also a problem when trying to separate casts from the impression without breaking off stone teeth. 2.38. Special Characteristics of Elastomeric Impressions:  have shown that polyethers, along with 2.38.1. Polysulfide rubber base and condensation s ilicone impressions should be poured within 25 minutes of their rem oval from  the m outh. Thes e m aterials do not have long term  dim ensional stability. Second pours m ay be made from these impressions, but the resulting cast does not have the sam e accuracy as the cast from  the first pour. Addition reaction silicone and polyether impressions show great dimensional stability. Pours of casts may be delayed up to 7 days with no significant loss of accuracy. Second pours m aintain accuracy of detail and dim ension comparable to first pours. 2.38.2. Polyethers are highly hydrophilic (they absorbminimized.

Impression Plaster and Soluble Impression Plaster: 2.39.1. Impression plaster is a plaster that has been specially compounded by the manufacturer for use in the mouth. It must set rapidly to reduce the time it is held in the mouth. Because plaster will not flex over an undercut as it is withdrawn from  the m outh, it m ust be broken into pieces and reassembled outside the m outh. For this reason,  it should be weak and brittle so it will fracture cleanly, and it must have a very low setting expansion to make an accurate impression. 2.39.2. Various accelerators and retarders are added to  give the plaster the required properties. In addition, coloring and flavoring agents are often added. Because of the difficulty som etimes experienced in rem oving a plaster im pression from the cast, som e impression plasters are m ade water soluble by adding cornstarch. If a separator is  used, the plaster can be dissolved off the cast with hot water. This decreases the possibility ofrom the impression.  breaking the cast when it is separated f2.40. Hydrocolloids. In partial denture work, an im pression material is needed that accurately registers both tooth and soft tissue undercuts. A hydrocolloid m aterial elastically deforms and then returns to its original shape. The undercuts are thus accurately reproduced in the im pression. There are two basic types of hydrocolloids, the agar type and the alginate type. They are chemically and physically different and require different handling, but the purposes for which they are used are very sim ilar. They are often referred to as  reversible  and  irreversible,  respectively. The agar type can be softened by heat and stiffened by cooling. Because this behavior can be driven either way, it is reversible. The alginate type is a powder that, when m ixed with water, hardens by  gelling. Because it cannot be softened to be used again, it is irreversible. 2.40.1. Hydrocolloid, Agar Type (Reversible). There are two different reversible hydrocolloids. One is designed to be used in the m outh for impressions; the other is compounded for duplication use in the laboratory as follows: 2.40.1.1. Impression Type. Impression hydrocolloid is a gelatin-like material that is composed mainly of agar-agar and water. The m aterial is heated in a double boiler or in a special heating 56  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 r duplicating in the laboratory if laboratory syringe to sof ten it to a thick consistency. It is  then tem pered, carried to the m outh in a tray, and cooled with 70  oF water to m ake it set. W hen it has set, it is rem oved, and the cast is poured. Im pression-type agar can be used foduplicating agar is not available. Its principle use, however, is for making RPD impressions and fixed prosthodontic final im pressions. A m ain di sadvantage of this m aterial is that an impression can only be poured one time due to the dim ensional change caused by the evaporation of water. 2.40.1.2. Laboratory Type. Laboratory duplicating hydrocolloid is specially m anufactured for laboratory use. It is stronger and, therefore,impression type. It can be used repeatedly if maintain a precise water balance, heat the material in a stainless steel double boiler.

The alginate-type hydrocolloid is supplied in the form  of a fine powder. The powder is m ixed with a prescribed  amount of water to form  a m ixture that, like the agar-type hydrocolloid, is capable of accurately reproducing an undercut of either a tooth or soft tissue. In general, the ingredients used to m ake an alginate impression material are sodium or potassium alginate, plaster, m agnesium oxide, trisodium phosphate, sodium  phosphate, and ditomaceous earth as a filler. 2.40.2.2. General Uses. Alginate is used as an im pression material for partial dentures. It can be used alone or in conjunction with another m aterial for immediate denture impression and is sometimes used for cast duplication in the labor atory. When used for duplicating, alginate is usually mixed with more than the usual amount of water (2 or 3 times more, depending on how fluid a mix is needed). 2.40.2.3. Handling Requirements: 2.40.2.3.1. Making an accurate cast from  a hydroc olloid im pression requires following certain rules. The water balance in a gelled hydr ocolloid material is critical to its accuracy. When gelled hydrocolloid is exposed to water or  air, it changes its dimensions quickly. This is why hydrocolloid impressions must be poured as soon as possible after they are made. (As soon as possible means within 10 minutes after the material is set.) 2.40.2.3.2. Reversible and irreversible hydrocollogypsum surfaces to be soft and chalky.

A great variety of materials have been used over the years to make denture bases. Today, a plastic material is by far the most universally used. The chemical name is methyl methacrylate; the common name is acrylic resin. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  57 onsiderable am ount of refinem ent and 2.41.2. Since it was first introduced in 1937, a cimprovement has been made in acrylic resin and in the methods of handling and processing it. 2.41.3. Manufacturers supply acrylic resin as both  a powder (polymer) and a liquid (m onomer) or in the form of a premixed gel. The powder and liquid form is the one most commonly used. When the m aterial is supplied in this form , the tec hnician adds a m easured am ount of powder to a specific volume of liquid to form  a dough. The dough is  then packed into the denture m old, and heat is used to cure (harden) the denture. Dry h eat can be used, but curing in hot water is the m ost commonly used m ethod. Known as  polymerization, the cure or hardening of the acrylic resin in the mold takes place by a chemical reaction between the powder and the liquid. 2.41.4. The types of denture base materials are shown in Table 2.5. C   Comment Improper packing and/or processing result in contamination, breakage, porosity, etc. Heat is required for polymerization. Basic composition is the same as the powder and liquid varieties. Must be refrigerated to inhibit polymerization. Heat is not required to induce polymerization. Can be applied by the “sprinkle” method or used in dough form. Pigments may be mixed with polymer powder or packed separately. Fine polymer powders that come in a variety of natural tooth shades. Available in self-curing or heat-curing forms. Polymerize to a semisoft state. Special processing equipment is necessary.  Table 2.5. Types of Denture Base Materials.

Heat-cured denture resins are processed in the dental laboratory, using heat and pressure to obtain a product that m eets the requirem ents of the particular appliance being constructed. Heat-cured  denture resins are bought in packages containing powder (polymer) and liquid (monomer). The monomer has an inhibitor to prevent polym erization until activated by heat. Monom er is highly flam mable. It  is a skin and eye irritant and is known to cause allergic reactions. 2.43. Acrylic Resin Gel. This is a prem ixed form of acrylic resin. The m anufacturer mixes the powder and liquid at the f actory and adds a substance (inhibitor) that prevents polym erization until the resin is placed in the m old and heated. The gel is m ore  homogeneous because it is m achine m ixed in large quantities. It is som ewhat handier and quicker to  lif e is lim ited so it m ust be refrigerated when stored. 2.44. Autopolymerizing (Chemically Activated) Resins: use, but its shelffference is that, instead of using heat to bring 2.44.1. Composition. Another member of the acrylic resin  group used in the dental laboratory is the autocuring or self-curing resin. The basic com position of these autopolym erizing resins is the same as that of heat-cured denture acrylic. The diabout polymerization, a chemical agent (activator) is added to the liquid so the dough polym erizes in about 10 to 20 minutes at room temperature. 2.44.2. Uses. The self-curing acrylic resins are used for most denture repairs. In repair procedures, these resins have a decided advantage over heat-cur ed resins because the denture does not have to be subjected to a high-curing tem perature which  often causes the denture base to warp. These resins are also used for im pression trays, record  bases, and denture base construction. The self-curing resins can be m ixed and used as a dough,  or they can be applied by the sprinkle m ethod. The liquid provided with the self-curing resins sbecause the activators are lighter than the liquid and tend to rise to the top of the bottle. hould always be well shaken before it is used 2.45.  Acrylic  Resins  Used  for  Tinting. Methyl-m ethacrylate resins are  used to m odify the color of basic pink, denture base plastics. The pigm ents are used  to m ore closely sim ulate the colors of natural gum tissue in the finished denture base. Some are applied to the desired areas of the denture mold before the resin material is packed; some are shaped into preformed patterns that are placed in the mold prior to packing. 2.46.  Hard-Lining  Resin. This is a slightly different type of acrylic resin which is marketed and intended for one step (clinical) denture relines. The m aterial has been com pounded specifically for clinical purposes. It does not lend itself well to laborat ory use. It can be used for im pression trays if a more suitable material is not available in the laboratory. 2.47.  Tooth-Colored  Acrylic  Resin. Tooth-colored m ethyl-methacrylate resins are very sim ilar to denture resin except for the color and finer particle size. Tooth-colored pigm ents are added to the polymer to sim ulate natural tooth shades. Tooth-colo red acrylic resins are available in heat-curing and autopolymerizing form s. They can be used to m ake denture teeth, veneer crowns, and tem porary restorations. These resins are extensively used to perform repairs. 2.48. Soft-Lining Resins. Some clinical conditions require a soft,  cushion-like liner in the tissue side of denture bases. These soft m aterials are usually known as  resilient liners. It is important for these lining materials to bond well to the denture base, resist tear ing, and retain their cushion effect. There are three basic kinds of lining resins; velum acrylic, silicone, and ethyl methacrylate. 2.48.1.  Velum  Acrylic  Resin. Velum  resin is a form  of acry lic resin that never polym erizes rigidly in the m anner of ordinary resin. It is  supplied as a powder and liquid. The liquid is m uch AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  59 ains a retarder which prevents the resin from  more viscous than regular acrylic liquid. It conthardening. The principal use of velum resin is in cleft palate prostheses. It is occasionally used for denture reliner when a soft m aterial is needed.  Unfortunately, the ingredient that keeps the resin soft is eventually lost. Loss of this ingredient causes the liner to gradually harden. Once it hardens, it must be replaced. 2.48.2. Silicone Resin Liners. These soft liner materials, composed primarily of silicone gum and a liquid or paste hardener, are available as heat-cured or autopolym erizing types. These silicone liners are the m ost truly elastic of  the sof t-lining materials. However, these liners have a m ajor disadvantage. They have poor abrasion resistan ce and are difficult to trim  properly. Also, like velum resins, silicone liners do not rem ain soft  indefinitely, although they harden m ore slowly than other lining materials. 2.48.3.  Ethyl  Methacrylate  (Sof  Pac®,  Dura  Soft®). Ethyl m ethacrylate is a two-com ponent, heat-processed resilient material designed for use  in the construction of long-term  denture relines and m axillofacial prostheses. Ethyl m ethacrylate bonds to m ethyl m ethacrylate, increasing its durability in the m outh. Ethyl methacrylate is processed using standard techniques. The liner can either be used against f resh acrylic in the initia l processing of  a new denture, or it can be cured against an existing denture base. Ethyl m ethacrylate offers easy polishing and finishing. It can easily be trim med with a carbide bur or arbor band. It is then polished to a luster using a cloth wheel, pumice, and polishing compound. to a healthy state, the dentist uses 2.49.  Tissue  Conditioners. Until the patient’s oral tissues return tissue conditions as a temporary soft liner for dentures that require relining. Tissue conditioners must be changed at 3 to 4 day intervals. Some clinical techniques use tissue conditioning resins in a denture base as the master impression for relining or rebasing an old denture or fabricating a new one. Because these materials are very delicate and do not adhere well to the denture base, tissue conditioner im pressions must be handled with great care in the laboratory. 2.50. Vinyl Resins and Polystyrenes. Vinyl and polystyrene are plastics which are chem ically similar to acrylic resin but differ som ewhat in their physical  properties. They are formed into a denture using a method of m olding known as  injection molding. Advocates of these m aterials say they have superior dimensional stability over acrylic resin dentures. 2.51. Handling Acrylic Resin. Acrylic resin, with all its good qualitie s of excellent appearance, am ple strength, lightweight, and ease of cleaning, is far from  foolproof in its m anipulation. Even when properly handled throughout the processing procedure, acr ylic resin is subject to dim ensional changes. These changes appear as minor faults in the occlusion and loss of contact of the processed resin with the master cast. The changes are m ore noticeable acro ss the posterior palatal seal area of a maxillary denture. However, changes can be kept to a minimum when the technician understands the behavior and working characteristics of the material, and takes precautionary steps to avoid certain pitfalls. The errors that are m ost apt to occur in processing acrylic re sin dentures are distortion, contam ination, warpage, breakage, and porosity, as follows: 2.51.1.  Wax  Distortion. An error can be introduced during the wax-up that m ay alter the occlusion on the finished dentures. To m inimize the effects of baseplate wax distortion, wax up one denture at a time. After the wax-up of this single unit is completed, it should be returned to the articulator and the occlusion examined. Correct any discrepancy in the occlusion before rem oving the other cast from  the articulator for wax- up. After com pleting the wax-up of both upper and lower dentures, exam ine the occlusion and correct any changes in it before beginning flasking procedures. 60  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 2.51.2.  Acrylic  Resin  Contamination. Acrylic resin is especially susceptible to contam ination while it is being m ixed and packed in the m old. Meticulous cleanliness m ust be practiced, and clean measuring containers are essential. Using  a clean, stainless steel sp atula, the mixing should be done in a clean jar. Hands should be gloved and kept very clean. Acrylic resin liquid is an excellent solvent capable of dissolving grease a nd dirt from  hands. A standard precaution is to handle the resin dough with plastic gloves or sheets rather than with bare hands. The mold must be absolutely clean and dry before the resin is packed. 2.51.3. Acrylic Resin Warpage. During the curing phase, several dim ensional changes occur in the acrylic resin. The net effect is shrinkage. A characteristic of  acrylic resin is that it shrinks toward its greatest bulk. In a denture, this bulk  is in the area over the alveolar ridge. From  waxup to finishing, this distortion can be kept withinprocedure is carefully performed as follows:  acceptable lim its if each step in the processing 2.51.3.1. Take great care to ensure the m old has cooled to room temperature before starting to deflask a denture. Rapid cooling may create uneven internal stresses. The ideal way to cool the flask is to allow the water in the curing bath to cool down to room temperature before removing the flask from the carrier press. If faster cooli ng of the flask is necessary, bench-cool the flask for 1 hour and then cool it for 15 minutes in cold water. 2.51.3.2. Warpage may also result from  excessive  heat generated during polishing operations. Avoid excessive pressure against brushes and ragwheels because heavy pressure during polishing generates heat. 2.51.3.3. Warpage occurs from allowing the denture  to dry out after it is processed. Com pleted acrylic resin prostheses of any ki nd must be stored in a container of water. If it m ust be mailed to another location, the denture should be sent in  a sealed plastic envelope containing a sm all amount of water. 2.51.4.  Resin  Breakage. Most breakage of acrylic resin occu rs during recovery of the denture from the m old. The breakage is often the result of careless deflaski ng. Deflasking cannot be hurried; take the time to do it right. 2.51.5. Acrylic Resin Porosity. Porosity may be due to one of the following handling errors: 2.51.5.1. An Improper Liquid-to-Powder Ratio: 2.51.5.1.1. The ratio of powder to liquid is im portant when m ixing acrylic resin. A high percentage of powder in a m ix speeds up the  set and tends to reduce shrinkage during the cure. However, sufficient liquid m ust be used to wet the powder thoroughly if the chem ical reaction between the two is to be completed. 2.51.5.1.2. The usual ratio is three parts of powder to one part of liquid by volum e. Ten cm3 of liquid to 30 cm 3 of powder is considered an adequate  amount of material for the average denture. Measure the liquid and pour it into a clean jar. Then measure and sift enough powder to absorb all the liquid. Tap the jar on the bench top to bring any excess liquid to the surface, and then add the rem aining powder. Thoroughly mix the powder and liquid with a stainless instrument. Unless the mixture is well stirred, the color tends to float to the surface of some brands of acrylic resin. 2.51.5.2. Packing the Dough Before it is Ready: 2.51.5.2.1. After mixing the acrylic resin, place a lid on the mixing jar and allow the resin to set for several m inutes. Then rem ove the lid  and test the m ix by placing the blade of the AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  61 spatula between the mix and the side of the mixing jar. When the mix no longer sticks to the side of the m ixing jar, most heat-curing resins are ready to pack. First, the m ixture appears sandy, then stringy, and finally doughy. When the doughy stage is reached, it is ready for the mold. 2.51.5.2.2. A further test involves m aking a roll of some of the material and pulling it apart. When it snaps apart cleanly, it has reached pack ing consistency. The test for proper packing consistency does not apply to all denture reanufacturer’s directions to ensure proper procedures are followed. sins. Be sure to read the m2.51.5.3. Underpacking the Mold: 2.51.5.3.1. The acrylic resin dough must be packed into room temperature molds. Too warm a mold may cause the dough to becom e too sti ff too fast. W hen trial packing, overfill the mold slightly and apply the pressure from the flask press very slowly until the two halves of  the flask are as near as possible to m etal-to-metal contact. Then release the pressure, open the flask, and remove the resin flash from the land area. 2.51.5.3.2. This procedure m ust be repeated at leas t three tim es to ensure the m old is full and the halves of the flask m eet in m etal-to-metal contact. To prevent opening of the occlusal vertical dim ension, additional m aterial m ust never be placed in the m old before final closure.  2.51.5.4.  Curing  the  Acrylic  Resin  Too  Quickly. The resin dough starts to polym erize at around 160 oF. As this chemical reaction takes place, heat is given off. The internal temperature of the flask tends to rise above the external h eat being used to m ake the resin polymerize. The faster the resin dough reaches curing tem perature, the m ore rapid the polym erization reaction and the higher the internal tem perature of  the flask. Depending on how fast polym erization progresses, a flask’s internal temperature can reach 300 oF. 2.51.5.4.1. The boiling point of the m onomer component of the resin dough is about 212  oF. If the dough reaches curing tem perature too quickly, the internal flask tem perature exceeds 212  oF and causes the m onomer to boil. A porous denture base are especially susceptible to this problem. 2.51.5.4.2. A packed flask m ust be brought to a cu ring temperature at a rate that does not induce rapid polymerization. A temperature rise of 2  oF per minute is recommended. Make sure the curing bath contains enough water to dissipate the excess heat that might be generated by the polymerization reaction. The flask press should never contact the bottom of the container; it should rest on a rack. resin results. The thick sections of a  Section 2F—Metals in Dentistry 2.52. Introduction: 2.52.1. Metals are alike in certain aspects. There is  no all-inclusive def inition for a m etal that is entirely satisfactory. However, m etals do have certain properties that distinguish them  from  nonmetals. They possess a m etallic luster; are good  conductors of heat and electricity; and, with the exception of mercury (and one other rare metal), are solids at ordinary temperatures. 2.52.2. As com pared to nonm etals, som e m etals  are m alleable (can be pounded or rolled into sheets), others are ductile (can be drawn into wire ), and most of them have a f airly high specif ic gravity (are dense and heavy as a result).  62  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 r aspects. For exam ple, each m etal possesses 2.52.3. Metals are also different in certain othephysical properties peculiar to it alone, which disti nguishes it from all other metals. It has a fixed melting point, a def inite specific gravity, and a  certain degree of hardness, malleability, ductility, etc. By knowing these physical properties, you can pr edict with a fair degree of accuracy the way a metal will behave under different conditions. In the sam e way, you can also predict a m etal’s degree of usefulness as a dental restoration or structural part of a prosthesis. 2.53. Structure of Metals: 2.53.1. General Properties: 2.53.1.1. Metals are crystalline in structure, and  many of their physical properties depend to a large extend on the size and arrangem ent of the crystals. The word  grain  is a very popular name for a m etallic crystal. As m olten metal cools and solidif ies, clusters of  molecules come together from the liquid to f orm solid crystal nuclei. These crystallites grow into grains. The faster molten metal cools to the solid state, the smaller will be the grain size and vice versa. 2.53.1.2. Generally speaking, sm all grains arranged ost desirable properties. The size and arrangem ent of grains can be changed m arkedly by the way the metal is handled in the laboratory. The am ount of heat a m etal is subjected to, the m ethod by which it is heated, the rate by which it is cooled, and the way it is worked (for example, bending or swaging) all have a pronounced effect on its physical properties. in an orderly fashion give the m2.53.2. Cast Metal. A  cast metal is a piece of m etal formed by pouring or forcing m olten metal into a m old and allowing it to cool and harden. As  previously stated, the size of the grains in a casting depends on the rate of cooling during solidification. The shape and arrangem ent of the grains are also established at the same time. 2.53.3.  Wrought  Metal. W hen rolling, pounding, bending, or twisting changes the shape of a casting, it becom es a wrought m etal. Producing change s in the shape of a m etal at norm al room temperature is called cold-working. Working a metal changes its grain structure and has a m arked (and sometimes detrimental) influence on the physical properties of the material. You must have a thorough understanding of the changes taking place necessary, correct the changes (paragraph 2.56.2). 2.53.4. Metal Alloys: in the worked m etal to control and, if ven m etal m ight be ideal for a me m etal m ight be less desirable or even 2.53.4.1.  Nature  of  Alloys. Som e of the properties of a gispecific use while other properties of the sadetrimental. By combining several metals in the correct proportions, it is possible to produce a compound in which the desirable properties of each  metal are retained, while the less desirable ones are nullified or entirely elim inated. This is known as  alloying,  and the com bination of metals thus f ormed is a m etal alloy. The physical properties of an  alloy cannot be accurately predicted solely by knowing the properties of th e constituent metals. For example, two metals of extreme hardness, when com bined, might yield an alloy of only m oderate hardness, rather than one as hard as (or harder than) the individual component metals. 2.53.4.2. Knowledge Requirement. With few exceptions, m etals used in dentistry are alloys. You should have an understanding of the structure and physical properties of dental alloys. This will enable you to accomplish the following: 2.53.4.2.1. Determine the combination of physical properties required in an alloy to be used for a prosthesis. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  63 2.53.4.2.2. Understand the proper manipulation and heat-handling procedures to be followed with the selected alloy in order to retain and make the most of its desirable properties. 2.54. Physical Properties of Metals. The physical properties of metals are described in definite, precise terms. A fam iliarity with the m eaning of these term s is basic to an understanding of the characteristic traits or the way a m etal behaves under different c onditions. Moreover, the suitability of a particular metal for a specific purpose can be determined only by someone who fully understands the terms used to describe its qualities. These qualities are explained in paragraphs 2.54.1 through 2.54.12. 2.54.1. Hardness: 2.54.1.1. This is a m easure of the re sistance of a m etal to an indentation or scratch. It is an indication of the strength and wearability of the metal. Due to the varied functions the different types of dental prostheses m ust perform ,  hardness  is a highly significant property of dental alloys. 2.54.1.2. For exam ple, different types of restorati ons call for varying degrees of hardness. An onlay casting, which is to be subjected to heavy  occlusal wear, should be harder than a casting made for the facial surface of a tooth. On the other hand, a metal m ight be too hard. The amount an inlay or crown can be burnished (ada pted) to a tooth is directly dependent on the hardness of the metal. Harder metals are more difficult to burnish. 2.54.1.3. Several m ethods are used for m easuring the hardness of m etals. When an alloy has been tested for hardness, it is given an index number. Depending on the method used to test the alloy, it is then said to have a certain  Brinell, Vickers, or Rockwell hardness (or another index). Regardless of the scale used, the higher the inde x number, the harder the metal. Figure 2.1 lists the comparative hardness of some common metals.  Figure 2.1. Comparative Hardness of Selected Metals.          Very Hard Chromium Manganese        Medium Hard  Cobalt  Nickel  Copper  Iron  Platinum Silver  Magnesium  inum ium Soft   Gold  Alum Cadm Tin  Lead     2.54.1.4. Brinell hardness is determined by pressing a steel ball into a dental gold alloy under a measured load. The amount of surface indentation is computed according to the load. 2.54.1.5. The Vickers test uses a diam ond in the shap e of a square-based pyram id. The test is more suitable for determ ining the hardness of a wider variety of m aterials. Recently, the Vickers test replaced the Brinell test for testing dental gold alloys. 2.54.1.6. The Rockwell hardness is a standard m easure of the hardness of an alloy. It is sim ilar to the other tests, but with a different range of numbers. It is often used to measure the hardness of chrome alloys. 2.54.2. Ductility. Ductility is the property of  a m etal that  permits it to be drawn into a thin wire without breaking. A study of the tables of har dness and ductility indicates that ductility decreases as hardness increases. Figure 2.2 lists the relative ductility of several metals. 64  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 2.54.3. Malleability. Malleability is an indication of the amount of extension the metal can sustain in all directions without breaking. The pressure might be applied by ham mering, rolling, or burnishing. Malleability makes it possible to burnish the margin of a gold restoration to the tooth’s surface and m inimize the chance of leakage between the two. Gold is the m ost malleable of all metals. One grain of  gold can be rolled and beaten in to a leaf that is 6 square f eet. A more brittle metal is less malleable. Figure 2.3 compares the malleability of several metals.  Figure 2.2.

Specific Gravity and Density: 2.54.4.1. Specific gravity is the weight of a unit of metal compared with an equal volum e of water at the same temperature. Specific gravity is som etimes a factor in planning the design of a cast partial denture. The design selected for a  dental prosthesis in which one of the heavier alloys is to be used might differ from one employing an alloy of a lighter weight. 2.54.4.2. The specific gravity of water is  one,  which is the standard of com parison. Thus, a metal that has a specific gravity of two is exactly twice the weight of an equal volume of water. Table 2.6 lists the specific gravity of some of the metals. 2.54.5. Elasticity, Flexibility, and Resiliency. Complete and technically accurate definitions of the term s elasticity, f lexibility, and resiliency ar e quite com plex. For laboratory purposes, they refer to the characteristic of an  alloy that enables it to bend under pressure and then return to its former shape when the pressure is rem oved. This is an important property in a RPD clasp because the clasp m ust spring on and off an abutm ent tooth without exerting harm ful pressure on the supporting structures of a tooth. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  2.54.6. Elastic Limit, Proportional Limit, and Yield Strength. These three term s have subtly different definitions. However, f or practical purpos es, the term s will be used interchangeably in this pamphlet. A gross definition for all three would be the m aximum amount of stress that can be applied to a metal without permanently deforming the metal.  Table 2.6.

Percentage Elongation. Elongation is a m easure of the am ount an alloy can be deform ed without breaking. The percentage of  elongation of an alloy has m uch to do with its suitability for making appliances that must be bent or burnished  into shape. The elongation should be as high as possible, consistent with strength requirements. 2.54.8. Grain Size: 2.54.8.1. When metal is heated and allowed to cool, the rate of cooling affects the grain size. Slow cooling results in a com paratively large  grain size. Fast cooling produces a finer grain structure. A metal with a fine grain structure is stronger than a coarse-grained one. 2.54.8.2. The metal rod at the top of Figure 2.4 wa s cast and solidified rapidly, which resulted in a fine grain structure. The rod in the lower part of the figure cooled slowly, which resulted in a larger grain size.  66  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 2.54.9. Grain Growth. Prolonged heating below a m etal’s melting temperature may cause grain growth; that is, small grains merging to form larger ones. This grain growth causes the metal to be brittle. Malleability and ductility can som etimes be restored in a m etal that has becom e brittle by heat-treating it. It is f ar better, however, to  handle the m etal in such a way that it never  becomes brittle.  Figure 2.4. Differences in Grain Size.  2.54.10. Color of Heated Metals: 2.54.10.1. When gold alloys are heated, definite color changes occur. The tem perature of the metal can be estim ated by the color it radiates as  listed in Howe’s Color Scale (Table 2.7). As metal is heated, colors are observed in the fo llowing sequence: dull red, brighter red, orange, and finally, white as the temperature progressively increases.  Table 2.7. Howe’s Color Scale. A   Color I T E M 1  Dull red 2  Cherry red 3  Light red 4  Orange 1650 5  Yellow 6  White 2100  Approximate Temperature B  Range 1020 - 1150 oF 1300 oF 1560 oF oF 1740 - 1920 oF oF or above 2.54.10.2. Tem peratures associated with the colo rs are only approxim ations because color determinations differ from  person to person. A nother variable in appraising the color of a heated metal is the light under which it is exam ined. The m etal may appear black in bright sunlight, but m ay look red when viewed in a shadow. W hen the color of a heated m etal is evaluated, it should be viewed in as near normal light as possible. 2.54.11. Melting Range: 2.54.11.1. Pure metals melt suddenly at definite places or  points on a temperature scale (Table 2.8). Dental alloys do not m elt abruptly at precise temperatures because they contain a num ber of metals with different m elting points. W hen a high enough tem perature is reached, an alloy AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  67 first softens and becom es mush. As the heat is increased, the alloy gradually becom es more fluid until it finally behaves much like a thick liquid.  Table 2.8. Melting Points of Pure Metals. Metal A   I T E M 1  Aluminum 1218 2  Beryllium 2332 3  Bismuth  4  Cadmium  5  Chromium 3434 6  Cobalt 2723 7  Copper 1981 8  Gold 1945 9 Iron 2795 10  Lead  11  Manganese 2246 12  Molybdenum 4748 13  Nickel 2651 14  Palladium 2820 15  Platinum 3190 16  Silver 1761 17  Tin  18  Tungsten 6098 19  Zinc  Melting Point B   oF oF 520 oF 610 oF oF oF oF oF oF 621 oF oF oF oF oF oF oF 450 oF oF 787 oF 2.54.11.2. This gradual softening takes place over a spread of tem perature known as the melting range. The lower limit of this range, known as the  solidus, is the temperature at which the metal first begins to soften. The higher limit, called the liquidus, is the temperature at which the metal is com pletely molten. The spread of  the melting range for m ost dental gold casting alloys varies from 75 to 150 oF. 2.54.12. Fusion Temperature. The manufacturer does not provide  the melting range of a casting alloy. Very often the  fusion temperature is provided instead. The fusion tem perature is slightly above the lower lim it of the m elting range. It s hould never be exceeded when a m etal is being soldered. The fusion tem perature is provided to ai d in selecting solder that has a m elting range safely below the f usion tem perature of  the pare nt m etal. This m inimizes the possibility of overheating the parent metal during a soldering operation.  2.55. Deformation of Metal: etal, it is opposed and resisted by the 2.55.1. W hen an external force (load) is applied to a minternal force of the m aterial’s otherwise regular ly spaced atom s (stress). If the load is great enough, a change results in the distance between the atom s in the areas where the load is applied (strain) and a degree of distortion (deform ation) occurs which is directly related to the am ount of the load and the direction in which it is applied. 68  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 the load is rem oved is called an  elastic  deformation. 2.55.2. A distortion that disappears when When the stresses are rem oved, the atom s return  to their original position. A distortion that does not disappear when the load is rem oved is called a  permanent deformation. (The metal is said to have exceeded its elastic limit or proportional limit or yield strength.) The stresses are not relieved and the affected groups of atoms slip along a plane to new positions within the boundaries of their particular grains. 2.55.3. If a piece of m etal is flattened by pounding or rolling, the individual grains are also flattened. As a pulling force is exerted on the m etal, like drawing it through a die plate to form  a wire, each grain is elongated to assume a fiber-like appearance. 2.56. Strain-Hardening of Metal: 2.56.1. Strain-Hardening or Cold-Working. When a metal is permanently deformed repeatedly, the m etal becom es stif fer and harder. This process is called   strain-hardening  or  cold-working. Continued application of a deform ing load results  in m ore and m ore atom s or grains slipping within the metal until the metal fractures. This is what happens when a paper clip is bent back and forth. Up to a point, it becomes stiffer and harder. Then it breaks. 2.56.2. Annealing or Heat Treatment: 2.56.2.1. Annealing is the process of heat-treating a m etal to remove the stresses introduced by cold working and to prevent the m etal’s fracture. For example, there is a considerable am ount of cold-working to bend or contour a wire to form a clasp to fit on the surface of a tooth. 2.56.2.2. The strain hardness built up in the m etal can be rem oved and the original properties restored by heating it to the proper tem perature (for example, cherry red) and then cooling it rapidly by quenching in cold water. The cold-working can then proceed because the regular arrangement of the slipped atom s has been rest ored and the stresses and strains have been relieved. The grains retain the changed shape caused by the cold-working. Thus, ductility and malleability increase, but all other physical properties decrease. The m etal is in its softest state so a crown or inlay is most burnishable and a partial denture clasp is most adjustable. 2.57. Effect of Constituent Metals. The exact role of a metal varies with the particular alloy system the metal is added to. For example, copper is included in many of the high palladium alloys to help form an oxide layer for porcelain bonding. Howeve r, copper is added to the m edium silver-palladium alloys to effectively lower their m elting range and perm it the use of gypsum -bonded investments. The following NOTE:  Their descriptions are elements are f requently used in the traditional gold-base alloys: (generalized.) 2.57.1. Aluminum (Al). Aluminum is added to lower the m elting range of the alloy. It is also a hardening agent and influences oxide formation. 2.57.2. Beryllium (Be). Like aluminum, beryllium lowers the melting range, improves castability, serves as a hardener, and influences oxide formation. Reportedly, it im proves polishability by acting as a lubricant for polishing agents, thus perm itting them  to work m ore ef fectively. Electrolytic “etching” of  nickel-chromium-beryllium alloys rem oves a nickel-beryllium  phase to create microretention for the etched-metal resin-bonded retainers (Maryland Bridges). 2.57.3. Boron (B). Boron is a deoxidizer, hardening agent, and elem ent that reduces the surface tension of an alloy and thereby im proves castability. In the nickel chrom ium alloys, boron acts to reduce ductility and to increase hardness. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  69 ore 2.57.4. Chromium (Cr). Chromium acts as a solid solution hardening agent and ensures corrosion resistance by its passivating nature. 2.57.5.  Cobalt  (Co). Cobalt-base alloys are an alternate to the nickel-base types, but are mdifficult to cast. 2.57.6. Copper (Cu). Copper serves as a hardening and strengthening agent, lowers the m elting range, and interacts with platinum , palladium , and  silver (if present) to provide a heat-treating capability. It helps form  oxides for porcelain bonding, lowers the density slightly, and can also enhance passivity. 2.57.7. Gold (Au). Gold provides a high level of resistance to corrosion and tarnish (no associated passivity) and slightly increases the m elting range as well as workability and burnishability. Gold imparts an esthetically pleasing color to the alloy while markedly increasing density. 2.57.8. Indium (In). Indium serves as a less volatile scav enging agent, tends to lower the m elting range (gold-base alloys), helps form  an oxide  layer for ceram ic alloys, and lowers the density. Reportedly, an indium content of 20 percent can adversely affect the corrosion resistance of silver-base alloys. 2.57.9. Iridium (Ir) and Ruthenium (Ru). These two elements serve as grain refiners to improve the mechanical properties and tarnish resistance. 2.57.10. Iron (Fe). Iron is usually added to gold-base ceramic alloys to harden the alloy and aid in the production of oxides for porcelain bonding. 2.57.11.  Manganese  (Mn). Like silicon, m anganese acts as an oxide scavenger to prevent the oxidation of other elements when the alloy is melted. It is also a hardening agent. 2.57.12. Molybdenum (Mo). Molybdenum is added to adjust the coefficient of thermal expansion and improve corrosion resistance. It also influences the oxides produced for porcelain bonding. 2.57.13.  Nickel  (Ni). Nickel has been selected as the base for alloys because its coefficient of thermal expansion is close to that of gold and  because it possesses a resistance to corrosion. It is easier to cast than the cobalt-base alloys. 2.57.14.  Palladium  (Pd). Palladium  is added to increase the strength, hardness (with copper), corrosion, and tarnish resistance of an alloy. It  increases the melting range and im proves the sag-resistance of a ceram ic alloy. Palladium  has a st rong whitening effect, which renders m etals as white alloys. It has a high affinity for hydrogen, and it lowers the density of the alloy slightly. 2.57.15.  Platinum  (Pt). Platinum  increases the strength, m elting range, and hardness while it improves the corrosion, tarnish, and sag-resistance of  an alloy. It whitens the alloy and increases its density. 2.57.16.  Silicon  (Si). Silicon serves as an oxide scavenger to prevent the oxidation ofelements during the melt. It is also a hardening agent. 2.57.17. Silver (Ag). Silver im parts a m oderate increase in the strength and hardness of an alloy (with copper), tends to tarnish in the presence of sulfur, possesses a rather high affinity for oxygen absorption, and lowers the density of the alloy. In  ceramic alloys, silver lowers the m elting range by counteracting the influence of palladium . Ceram ic alloys with a high silver content may produce discoloration (green or brown) in many porcelains. 2.57.18.  Tin  (Sn). Tin serves as a hardening agent, tends to decrease the malloy, and helps produce an oxide layer in ceramic systems. elting range of the  other 70  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 2.57.19. Titanium (Ti). Titanium is added to lower the m elting range and im prove castability. It also acts as a hardener and influences oxide formation. 2.57.20. Zinc (Zn). Zinc helps lower the m elting range and  acts as a deoxidizer or scavenger to combine with any oxides present. It im proves the castability of an alloy and, when com bined with palladium, contributes to its hardness. Zinc is commonly included in gold alloy solders. 2.58.

Dental  Alloy  Terminology. There are so m any different m etal-ceramic alloys for porcelain bonding, each with its own peculiar handling characteristics. For that reason, it is often difficult to accurately communicate with others about these alloys . For exam ple, Olympia is the brand nam e of a metal-ceramic alloy that can be called either a  precious alloy, a  high noble alloy, or a  gold-palladium alloy. It is easy to see why there is so m uch confusion associated with describing a particular alloy. The most accurate description of an alloy can only be m ade by listing its m ajor constituents and any m inor metal considered important for its functional use. 2.60. Conventional Dental Gold Alloys (Nonceramic). Conventional gold alloys are used to fabricate and repair inlays, onlays, crowns, and fixed partial  dentures. These gold-base alloys can be organized into three categories; casting gold, gold solder, and gold  foil. Each is formulated and marketed in a form best suited to its intended use. 2.60.1. Dental Casting Golds: 2.60.1.1. Casting golds are alloyed and m ade into ingots suitable for melting and casting into a mold. Different types of restorations require all oys with slightly different physical properties. An alloy used f or an inlay m ust have som ewhat different capabilities than an alloy used f or a crown or fixed partial denture. 2.60.1.2. The physical property  hardness is regarded as a useful indi cator of the strength of an ade using a  soft or  medium  gold alloy alloy. Therefore, restorations such as inlays are m(formerly Type I and II). Sim ilarly, a crown or  fixed partial denture requires a m uch harder casting alloy. On occasion, even RPD frameworks are made of extra hard gold for patients who may be allergic to chrom e alloys. The dentist se lects the type of casting alloy according to the needs of the particular case, personal preference, and availability. 72  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 2.60.1.3. Elements most commonly found in gold-base  casting alloys are gold, silver, copper, platinum, palladium , and zinc. Table 2.11 show s typical com positions of conventional gold casting alloys according to hardness. 2.60.1.4. The increased use of silver in m edium and hard alloys is intended to lighten the color of the alloy, not affect the hardness. As the coppe r content of gold alloys is increased, the color of the alloy is darkened unless it is offset by s ilver. Most people consider this darker color less attractive.  Table 2.11. Typical Composition of Conventional Gold-Casting Alloys.

The zinc in these alloys is present tomolten metal. As a result, when the copper is incr eased, the zinc content is also increased. Zinc lowers the melting range of the finished alloy a nd makes the material more fluid and easier to cast. 2.60.1.6. Heat treatm ent of wrought and cast golds isprocedures in which they are used. Careless heat handling is responsible for much of the breakage of cast and wrought wire prosthetic a ppliances. When gold alloys are properly heat treated, their desirable properties are appreciably increased. oF (cherry red) for 10 m inutes and 2.60.1.7. In general, when gold alloys are heated to 1292 then quenched in water, the m etal is in its  softest state (annealing). Ductility and m alleability increase, all other physical properties show d ecreased values. W rought gold is m ost bendable and cast gold is more burnishable (adaptable) after being subjected to softening heat treatment. 2.60.1.8. Gold restorations that are to be subjected  to heavy chewing loads or other m echanical pressures in the mouth cannot be used in a heat-softened condition because they would deform  too easily. These restorations m ust be treated by  a process of controlled heating and cooling to restore hardness called  tempering. For example, certain gold alloys are hardened by heating to 840 oF, allowed to cool slowly over a 15-m inute period to 480  oF, and then quenched in water. Gold alloy destined for heat hardening should first be heat softened. Any strain hardening is relieved, and the heat hardening process yields more predictable results. 2.60.1.9. There are two ways of expressing the gold c ontent of an alloy. One is in term s of its carat  and the other is its   fineness. By definition, a carat is a unit of m easure that indicates purity of form ulation. A 24-carat rating m eans th at a m etal is solid gold with nothing else added. A metal having an 18-carat rating is auto matically an alloy, 18 parts of which are gold. fineness  is similar to carat only it The six rem aining parts are other m etals. The concept of deals with 1,000 parts instead of 24.  Pure gold is said to be 1,000 fine . Therefore, if an alloy is AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  75 percent gold, it is 750 fine. An easy way to convert fineness to carat and vice versa is to insert the known number into the following formula and solve for the unknown: 73 Cara = Fineness 24 1000  2.60.2. Gold Solders. Gold solders are primarily used to join units of fixed partial dentures. They are also used in repairs of all kinds--everyproximal contacts on restorations. Solders are supp lied in m any forms. Wires and strips are the most common. thing from  plugging holes in castings to adding 2.60.2.1. Physical Properties of Gold Solders: 2.60.2.1.1. Melting Range. Dental gold solders are designed to melt and flow within precise temperatures called a melting range. A melting range is the temperature range from the time an alloy begins to melt until it is completely molten. A precise melting range is necessary to prevent overheating and m elting the parts to be joined (that is, the parent m etal). Solders should melt at a tem perature 100  oF below the fusion tem perature of the parent m etal. Tin and zinc are added to solder form ulas to provide a fusion temperature lower than the fusion temperature of the parent m etal. The melting range of a typical, conventional gold solder is 1375 to 1445 oF. 2.60.2.1.2. Tarnish Resistance. After a soldered prosthesis has been in the patient’s m outh for a period of tim e, the solder should show a de gree of tarnish resistance that is very close to the parent metal. 2.60.2.1.3. Color Compatibility. The color of the solder should m atch the parent m etal as closely as possible. 2.60.2.1.4.  Strength  Requirement. As the fineness of solder increases, its strength decreases. Solders with fineness ratings in ex cess of 650 should not be used to unite fixed partial denture units that are subject to a lot of stress. 2.60.2.2. Choosing a Solder: 2.60.2.2.1. When the Properties of the Parent Metal are Known. Several rules of thum b can be used in selecting a solder if either th e carat, fineness, or the fusion temperature of the parent metal or m etals is known. The prim ary  objective is to pick a solder with a fusion temperature about 100 to 150 oF lower. Solder with carat ratings that are two values lower or than the parent m etal are assum ed to have fusion fineness ratings that are 100 units lower temperatures at least 100 oF lower than the parts to be joined. 2.60.2.2.2. When the Properties of the Parent Metal can be Guessed. Fixed prosthesis castings that are not porcelain veneered are  made with conventional Type II or Type III oF; golds. The m inimum fusion tem perature  for these kinds of golds is around 1650 therefore, a solder should be selected accord ingly. A problem arises when the m ass of gold alloy used to m ake a casting already contains  some solder (for exam ple, a reclaim ed fixed partial denture). The presence of the solder act s to lower the fusion temperature of the mass. If a technician tries to solder castings w ith this kind of unknown com position, success is doubtful. If old, previously used gold is recy cled, the solder m ust be ground off. Ceram ic golds have melting ranges in excess of 2100 oF. 2.60.2.3.  Supplemental  Remarks. The 650-fine solder is widely used for soldering fixed prosthetic restorations m ade out of conven tional casting golds. As fineness increases above 74  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 650, tarnish resistance increases, but strength drstronger but m ay descend below acceptable tarnis h resistance lim its. If ceram ic casting golds are soldered  before  porcelain fusion, use special so lders that m elt at around 2000  oF.  After porcelain fusion, they can be soldered with m aterials used on conventional casting golds (for example, a 650-fine solder). ops off. Below 650 fine, the solder gets 2.60.3. Gold Foil. Foil is used in repairs such as repairi ng a hole in a gold crown with solder. It is fabricated at the refinery by rolling gold into sheets of various thickness. 2.61.  Alternatives  to  Gold-Base  Alloys  (Nonceramic). There are  precious  nongold-base alloys and nonprecious chrome alloys which are offered as altern atives to conventional gold-casting alloys. The nonprecious alloys, nickel-chromium and cobalt-chromium, are less desirable alternatives and, as such, are not discussed here. The rem aining precious all oy group can be subdivided into the following three subgroups: 2.61.1.  High  Silver-Palladium  Group. Alloys in this group contain roughly 70 to 71 percent silver and 25 percent palladium . They require  the use of phosphate-bonded casting investm ents and generally possess gold-base alloy handling char acteristics. These alloys cost less than gold-base alloys. 2.61.2.  Medium  Silver-Palladium  Group. This second group of silver-palladium  alloys was developed to provide a less expensive casting alloy that could be used with conventional gold techniques. These alloys contain between 58 to  68 percent silver, 25 to 26 percent palladium , and 10 to 15 percent copper. Adding copper to this sy stem lowers the m elting range and perm its the use of gypsum-bonded investments. Several of these alloys possess properties similar to extra hard casting golds, while others are m arketed as hard casting gold alternatives. Som e alloy brands can be cast into gypsum -bonded investm ents, wh ile others require phosphate-bonded casting investments. Consult the manufacturer’s directions regarding information on their use. 2.61.3.  Silver-Palladium-Gold  Group. By lowering the silver content of the silver-palladium  system and replacing copper with gold, m anufacturers produce a more tarnish-resistant alloy. The increase in noble m etal content of this system  m akes this alloy m ore expensive, but it is still cheaper than conventional gold-base alloys. P hosphate-bonded investm ents are indicated with these alloys and processing is similar to the high silver-palladium group. 2.62.  Metal-Ceramic  Alloys. These high-m elting range alloys are blended for porcelain application. They retain both form and physical properties when  porcelain is applied and fused to them . The alloy’s coefficient of therm al expansion is slightly m ore than porcelain, placing the porcelain veneer under compression when the alloy cools. The porcelain is m ost likely to rem ain attached to the alloy in this condition. The titles of the following subparagraphs show the classification of the metal-ceramic alloy in parenthesis beside each alloy topic: 2.62.1. Gold-Platinum-Palladium (High Noble): 2.62.1.1. Alloy Contents. Gold-platinum-palladium alloys contain m ostly gold. Platinum  and palladium are added to raise the melting tem perature, reduce the coefficient of therm al expansion, and strengthen the alloy. Sm all portions  of base m etals, such as indium , zinc, and tin, are included to produce a thin oxide film  on the surface of the gold alloy which provides the chemical means for bonding between the metal and porcelain. 2.62.1.2. Advantages. The bond strength of gold-platinum -palladium alloys is excellent. They also cast easily, finish and polish easily, and produce fine, burnishable margins. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  75 2.62.1.3.  Disadvantages. The only reasons for replacing gold- platinum-palladium alloys are cost and m echanical strength. To m aintain its stre ngth, this alloy m ust be used in f airly thick sections in areas such as connectors. One of th e other alloys might be a better choice for a long span fixed partial denture subject to increased occlusal loading. 2.62.2. Gold-Palladium-Silver (Medium Noble): the gold-platinum -palladium alloy described 2.62.2.1.  Alloy  Contents. The elim ination of platinum  and the addition of silver are the principal differences between this alloy and above. Silver tarnishes and is, therefore, not a noble metal. 2.62.2.2.  Advantages. These newer “white golds” or “sem iprecious” alloys have gained in popularity, probably due to their lower cost and increased mechanical strength. Because these alloys are higher in yield strength than the hi gh gold content alloys, they are useful for long-span restorations. They are easy to cast, finish, and polish. 2.62.2.3.  Disadvantages. The silver present in these alloys m ay cause  greening  of the fired porcelain and contam ination of the m uffle w ithin the porcelain furnace. Also, the high palladium content can increase the risk of  hydrogen gas absorption during casting. During the porcelain processing step, the release of hydrogen  gas from the metal can create gas bubbles in the porcelain veneer. Although, the porcelain -palladium alloy, it is adequate. bond is not as good as the gold-platinum2.62.3. Palladium-Silver (Low Noble). More recently, an effort has been m ade to eliminate gold from metal-ceramic alloys completely by substituting palladium and silver. 2.62.3.1.  Alloy  Contents. The m anufacturer m ust achieve  a careful balance between the amount of palladium and silver in the alloy because increasing the palladium  content raises the melting range and lowers the coefficient of expansion, whereas silver has the opposite effect. 2.62.3.2. Advantages. Due to the lower density of  palladium-silver alloys combined with their low intrinsic cost, these alloys have a substantia l decrease in total m etal cost com pared to the gold-containing alloy system s. A further advantag e is that their handling characteristics and physical properties are comparable. 2.62.3.3. Disadvantages. The disadvantages associated with the use of palladium and silver are the same as in paragraph 2.62.2.3. Additionally, the increase in palladium  makes casting more difficult because of the hydrogen gas absorptorches requires critical adjustment to produce the correct flame for melting. Using carbon-free investments is also a must because residual carbon can affect the grain structure of the alloy. tion. The gas and oxygen pressure of casting 2.62.4. Palladium (High Noble). Although palladium-silver alloys were in great dem and because of the low intrinsic cost, the dental profession wanted alloys that did not cause greening problems. Research led to alloy system s which reverted back  to silver-free systems. In place of silver, m ore palladium was added. 2.62.4.1.  Advantages. Increasing the palladium  content im parts greater hardness, toughness, and strength to the alloys. W ith silver com pletely eliminated from the alloys, greening of the porcelain veneer is not a problem. 2.62.4.2. Disadvantages. High palladium  alloys are m ore difficult to cast. For exam ple, more casting pressure is needed because of the lowe r density, and care m ust be taken not to induce excessive amounts of hydrogen, oxygen, or carbon into the m elt. The torch flam e must have 76  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 just the right balance of gas and oxygen. Carbon  contamination can appear from  such sources as carbon-containing investments, waxes, plastic patterns, carbon crucibles, or liners. 2.62.5. Base Metal. Base metal alloys (or nonprecious alloys, as they have been called) are similar in composition to the alloys used in RPDs.  NOTE: The other elem ents contained in base m etal alloys could be molybdenum, manganese, magnesium, aluminum, silicon, beryllium, carbon, iron, titanium, or copper. Although beryllium  is often omitted from some alloys because of its toxicity, it hardens the alloy and im proves castability. Cobalt-chromium alloys are rarely used in porcelain bonding. 2.62.5.1. Advantages. The properties of base m etal alloys are considerably different from  the noble m etal alloy system s. In general, the base m etal alloys are m uch stiffer and harder, requiring high-speed equipm ent to finish and po lish the alloy. Because of this strength, base metal alloys for porcelain bonding are useful where long-span, thin substructures are necessary. They are also the only metal alloys that can be used in the acid etch technique of m aking resin-bonded FPDs. Low cost has probably been the singl e most important consideration in selecting base metal alloys over noble alloy materials. 2.62.5.2. Disadvantages. Specialized casting and finishi ng equipment is recom mended when working with base metal alloys. Because these  alloys do not contain noble m etals, they readily oxidize when heated. In addition, they mbetween the porcelain and metal to fail. Because of the high oxidizing tendency, the techniques for metal preparation and porcelain additions are  different from those used with noble alloys. There has also been controversy over the allerg enic and carcinogenic potentials of nickel used in nickel-chrom ium alloys (m ostly with RPDs ). In addition, alloys containing beryllium  are becoming more suspect because of beryllium’s toxic and unstable character. ay develop too m any oxides, causing the bond 2.62.6.

The ADA specification for cast chrom ium c ontaining alloys says “ . . . the alloy contains a total of no less than 85 percent by weight of chrom ium, cobalt, and nickel.” This allows a lot of latitude for putting an alloy formula together. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  77 e alloy are reviewed for 2.63.1.2. W hen the form ulas for the different brands of chromconstituents com mon to all of them , they c ontain roughly 20 to 30 percent chrom ium and highly variable am ounts of nickel a nd cobalt. As an exam ple, Ticonium ® Premium 100 alloy contains about 25 percent chrome and 60 percent nickel, with no cobalt present. 2.63.1.3. Other brands of alloys have much le ss nickel and proportionally m ore cobalt. According to the ADA’s  Guide to Dental Materials and Devices, a chrome alloy with a high nickel content is reported to have a lower m elting range and less therm al contraction than a chrome alloy with a high percentage of cobalt. In contrast to nickel-chrom e alloy, the cobalt-chrome family of alloys cast at tem peratures that require a high-heat investm ent with a silicate or phosphate binder. Sm aller amounts of severa l other m etals such as m olybdenum, tungsten, beryllium, iron, m anganese, and alum inum are fre quently a part of chrom e alloy form ulas. Table 2.13 gives a general idea of chrom e alloy composition. CAUTION: Prolonged exposure to beryllium is harm ful. Proper dust-collecting a pparatus must be used when f inishing alloys that contain this metal.  Table 2.13. Approximate Proportions of Metals in Various Chrome Alloys.

Properties of Chrome Alloys. These alloys are considerably harder than the gold alloys and have much higher melting ranges. The specific gravity of these alloys is only about half that of the gold alloys. This factor m akes possible a reduction in weight of the RPD casting over one made from a gold alloy. Special equipment is required for casting and finishing the chrome alloys. Due to the differences in hardness and m elting temperatures of chrome alloys, equipment used for gold alloys is not suitable. 2.64. Wrought Alloys. Wrought alloys are m ade through a pro cess of rolling, annealing, and drawing into the various forms. This processing gives the alloys  certain physical properties that are of interest to the dentist. The elastic and flexible  nature of the alloy is of particular im portance. It allows a wrought wire clasp to  spring into an undercut area. Due to their increased tensile and yield strength, wrought alloys do not deform as easily. 78  2.64.1. Base Metal Alloys: AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 2.64.1.1. Forms of Wrought Base Metal Alloys. Wrought base m etal alloys are available in the form of wires and bond materials. Nickel-chromium and cobalt-chromium are the two main ese alloys are com monly referred to as  stainless types of wrought alloys presently used. Thsteels. 2.64.1.2. Rules for Handling. Certain procedures must be followed if the desired properties of wrought alloys are to be m aintained. When working with wrought wires, avoid m aking bends too quickly. Do not m ake bends th at are too large or too sharp and do not nick or dent wires because it causes them to break when stress is applied. Also, if repeated bending and shaping is necessary, heat-soften the wire to relieve the  stress effects of cold-working caused by bending and shaping. For best results, follow the m anufacturer’s instructions for heat-softening. W hen soldering stainless steel wires, take special  care to prevent overheating the wire. A prolonged exposure to temperature in excess of 1300 oF softens the wire and reduces corrosion resistance. 2.64.2. Gold Alloys: 2.64.2.1. Forms of Wrought Gold Alloys. Wrought gold is made in the form of wires and bars that can be used to m ake individual, wrought  gold clasps or an entire RPD fram ework. The gold is alloyed to give it the properties needed so  it can be bent and shaped into a desired form  and so several different units can be joined by dental solder. 2.64.2.2. Grain Structure. Because of its m ethod of m anufacture, dental wrought gold has a different grain structure than cast gold. Because of its grain structure, it is considerably tougher than cast gold and has a higher yield strength and proportional limit. 2.64.2.3. Sizes of Wrought Gold Wire. The manufacturer makes wrought gold from gold alloy that is rolled, swaged, and drawn through the die  plates into the desired shape and gauge. The gauge is a measure of the thickness or diameter of the wire. The numbers used are the standard Brown and Sharpe gauge num bers used by m achinists. The larger the gauge num ber, the smaller the diam eter. A com parison of the gauge  number and the equivalent m easurement in inches and millimeters is shown in Table 2.14.  Table 2.14.

Composition  of  Wrought  Gold  Wire. Dental wrought gold wires m ust have high fusion temperatures so the different parts of the clasp can be assem bled by soldering without the danger of overheating the wire. For this reas on, platinum and palladium are added in m uch AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  79 greater amounts than those used in the casting alloys. The following formula is typical although some wrought wires presently m arketed m ight  contain considerably m ore platinum  and palladium, and correspondingly less gold. W rought wi res are usually silver-colored, due to their high percentages of platinum  and palladium. A typical form ula includes zinc (1 percent), palladium (5 percent), silver (8 percent), coppe r (13 percent), platinum  (15 percent), and gold (58 percent). 2.64.3. Gold Wire. Wrought gold wire is used to m ake RPD clasps. Wrought gold bars are used as lingual and palatal bars. Clasps and bars can  be assembled into a complete RPD framework by using dental gold solder. 2.65. Technique Alloys. Technique alloys are used m ainly for m aking demonstration models and for student practice. They resemble gold in appearance although they differ markedly in physical properties. They have an extrem ely low tarnish resistance and  oxidize rapidly at ordinary tem peratures. A typical formula for one such alloy is 12 parts silver, 68 parts copper, and 20 parts zinc. 2.66. Low-Fusing Alloys: 2.66.1. Several low-fusing alloys are m arketed for dental laboratory use. They are often used to pour the tooth portions of an opposing cast in the construction of a com plete denture against natural teeth. They are also used to rem ount fi xed prosthodontic castings in an articulator for occlusal adjustments. (See AFPAM 47-103, Volume 2, Dental Laboratory Technology, Fixed and Special Prosthodontics, Chapter 1.) 2.66.2. Low-fusing alloys m elt at such low tem peratures they can be poured into any elastom eric impression material as well as into alginate or agar im pressions without dam aging them. These alloys are m arketed with a variety of trade nam es. All of the form ulas are m ade using different proportions of the following low-fusing metals: bismuth (520 oF), cadmium (610 oF), indium (314 oF), lead (621  oF), and tin (450  oF), (Table 2.15). The m anufacturer strives to produce an alloy with a m inimum of dim ensional change as it is heated and cooled.  NOTE: Cadmium fumes are toxic. A good way to beat the cadmium vapor problem is to melt cadmium-containing alloys under hot water.  Table 2.15. Typical Low-Fusing Alloys.

For convenient use, all of the low-fusing a lloys mentioned can be m elted and poured off into disposable plastic, 60 cm 3 syringes. W hen metal is needed, heat it in the syringe under hot water and dispense it directly from the syringe as required.  2.67. Platinum Foil: 2.67.1. Platinum foil is m anufactured by rolling plati num metal into thin sheets, the appropriate gauge of tinfoil. Pure platinum  has a strong affinity for m olten gold which m akes it a very useful metal in the dental laboratory. Platinum  is us ed in gold, wrought-wire clasp construction as a 80  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 matrix on which to f low the solder f or the occlusal  rest.

Because of its high mplatinum foil is not affected appreciably by the heat of the furnace. elting point (3190  Section 2G—Dental Porcelains 2.68. Introduction: 2.68.1. Highly glazed porcelain is one of  the materials most compatible with oral tissues and one of the m ost esthetically pleasing of the dental  materials. It is used for denture teeth, facings, complete crowns, and veneered fixed prosthodontic units. 2.68.2. Porcelain does not have the crus hing or shear strength of cast m etal, but when it is used in the proper bulk and with adequate support, it is very satisfactory for dental restorations. Dental porcelains are classified according to fusion te mperature. High-fusing temperatures (2350 to 2500 oF) are used for denture teeth; m edium-fusing tem peratures (2000 to 2300 oF) are used for porcelain facings; and low-fusing temperatures (1200 to 1950 oF) are used for crowns and veneers. 2.68.3. All of the dental porcelains used to fabricate porcelain veneers or com plete porcelain crowns fall into the low temperature range and are thus classified as low-fusing porcelain. 2.69. Manufacturing Dental Porcelain: 2.69.1. Glass Properties. Dental porcelain is basically glass. W hen heated, it can be shaped and molded into a variety of things. Glass is physically a supercooled liquid rather than a solid. However, ordinary glass m ust be m odified and carefully com pounded before it can be called dental  porcelain. The com position of porcelain is carefu lly controlled to m odify the physical properties of the glass both in the m olten and  solid form . These properties include viscosity, melting temperature, chemical durability, thermal expansion, and resistance to devitrification. 2.69.2.  Vitrification  and  Devitrification. Vitrif ication is the developm ent of  porcelain that resembles glass. It is im portant to know what  vitreous (m ature) porcelain looks like. Mature porcelain exhibits maximum shrinkage. The surface is  completely sealed, and the surface detail is slightly rounded. Devitrification occurs when the firing sequence is interrupted. W hen this occurs, the porcelain tends to crystallize, making it difficult to form a glazed surface. 2.69.3. Fritting: 2.69.3.1. Before this process begins, the natural feld spar and glass fluxes are m ixed together in powdered form. Then the raw minerals are mixed together in a refractory crucible and heated to a temperature well above the firing tem peratures used in the laboratory. The m inerals all melt together to form a molten glass which is quenched in water. The mass cracks and fractures, and it is from this frit that the porcelain powders are made. 2.69.3.2. The process of blending, m elting, and que nching the glass com ponents is called fritting. Each tim e this is done, m ore of the undissolv ed particles are converted to glass. The particles become so small they merely fuse together when they are heated. By prefiring  in this manner, the m anufacturer can control the m aturing tem perature and translucency of the porcelain. 2.69.4.  Sintering. This term  m ore accurately describes the firing  process. As the porcelain powders are heated, they partially fuse togeth er to form  a com pact, noncrystalline solid. Unlike AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  81 metals with crystalline structures, glass is com paratively weak because the atom s are arranged in an irregular pattern. 2.70. Basic Composition. Low-fusing dental porcelains can be di vided into two groups, feldspathic and aluminous porcelain (paragraph 2.71). Although different in their specific makeup, they share a common feldspathic glass frit. Paragraph 2.69.3 describes thSpecific ingredients comprise dental porcelain. The following ingredients and their use provide valuable insight into the physical properties of dental porcelain: e fritting process and its effect on the porcelain. 2.70.1.  Glass  Formation. The principle elem ent in all glasses is oxygen (O 2), which form s a stable bond with silicon (Si) to produce SiO 4 tetrahedra. SiO 4 is called a silicate, com monly known by another nam e--sand. Silicon is the m ajor glass-forming oxide in dental porcelain, but boron and alumina may also be used. 2.70.2. Fluxes or Alkali: oxygen network to lower the softening 2.70.2.1. Fluxes are added to the basic silicon-temperature and increase the therm al expansion of a glass.  Potassium,  sodium,  and  calcium oxide are the glass m odifiers used as fluxes. The m anufacturer has to control the use of these fluxes because they have a drastic effect on the viscosity (fluidness) of the glass and its thermal expansion. For example, the soda content is increased in m etal-bonding porcelains to raise the thermal expansion of the porcelain to that of the metal alloys. This addition has an adverse effect on the porcelain because it is now more  susceptible to devitrification (a problem  associated with metal porcelains). 2.70.2.2. Lower viscosity is another problem  caused by adding fluxes, but it can be corrected using intermediate oxides. 2.70.3.  Intermediate  Oxides.  Aluminum  oxide is the m ost common intermediate oxide used to increase the hardness and viscosity of porcelain. De ntal porcelains must maintain their shape and not slump when heated. Fluxes used to be added to  lower the softening temperature, but they also lowered the viscosity. Now, interm ediate oxides are added to produce glasses with high viscosity as well as low-firing temperatures. 2.70.4. Coloring and Opacifying Agents. Presently, the porcelain frit lacks the color to sim ulate the denture and enam el shades of teeth. It may appear opalescent or assum e a gray-blue translucency sim ilar to natural incisal enam el. Another problem  is the slightly greenish hue exhibited by all glasses. In order to dam pen down this effect and to produce life-like dentin and enamel colors, the basic dental porcelain frit must be colored as follows: 2.70.4.1. Color Pigments. The dental porcelain frit is usua lly colored by adding concentrated glasses. These glasses are m etallic oxides f ritted with the basic glass used to modify the uncolored porcelain powder. The metallic oxides used to color dental porcelain appear in Table 2.16. The dental porcelain now has color, but is fa r too translucent. Therefore, certain oxides must be added to opacify the porcelain, particularly the dentine shade. 2.70.4.2.  Opacifying  Agents. An opacif ying agent generally consists of a m etallic oxide le size. Com mon oxides are  cerium  oxide,  titanium  oxide,  and ground to a very fine particzirconium oxide (Table 2.16). In the enamel porcelains, very little opacifier is used because this porcelain requires more translucency. The formation of dental porcelain is now complete.  82  Table 2.16. Metallic Oxides Used in Coloring and Opacifying Dental Porcelains. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 B   Metallic Oxide Responsible Chromium-tin or chrome alumina are useful in eliminating the greenish hue in the glass and adding a warm tone to the porcelain. Indium or praesodymium are the most stable for producing the ivory shades. Chromium oxide is green and the characteristic color of glass. This color should be avoided. Iron oxide (black) or platinum (gray) are useful in making enamels or for dentines in the gray section of the shade guide. They can also give an effect of translucency. Cerium oxide, titanium oxide, and zirconium oxide. I T E M 1 2 3 4 A   Color/Effect Pink Yellow Green Gray 5 Opacity  2.71. Low-Fusing Porcelain Systems. The basic types of porcelain system s are feldspathic porcelain (used in veneering m etal substructures), aluminous porcelain (used in making porcelain jacket crowns), and leucite porcelain (used with pressable porcelains). 2.71.1.  Feldspathic  Porcelain. Natural feldspar is any group of m inerals, principally alum ina silicates of potassium , sodium , and calcium . Natural feldspar contains m ost of the elem ents needed for glassm aking. Glass fluxes such as temperature of the glass. This mixture can be fritted at a specific temperature to obtain the desired porcelain frit. Feldspathic porcelains are used in  metal ceramic crowns. They have a firing range of 900 to 960 oC. 2.71.2. Aluminous Porcelain: boric oxide are added to lower the softening 2.71.2.1. The addition of pure alumina (Al2O3) to the feldspar-flux mass greatly strengthens the porcelain. Alumina is the only true crystalline ceram ic used in dentistry. It is the hardest and probably strongest oxide known. 2.71.2.2. Aluminous porcelain is three tim es stronger than feldspathic porcelain and it has six times its crushing strength. Unfortunately, added alumina also decreases translucency. 2.71.2.3. The three m ain types of alum inous porcel ain include a high-strength core m aterial containing as m uch as 50 percent pure alum ina crystals, dentine (containing 5 to 10 percent alumina crystals), and enam el veneer powders . The core buildup strengthens the all ceram ic crown much the same as a metal substructure, but to a lesser degree. 2.71.3. Leucite Porcelain. Leucite-reinforced ceramic powders are pressed to form  ingots which are the basis for an all-ceram ic restoration. This  system uses the lost-wax technique associated with conventional m etal-ceramic restorations. Af ter burnout, the ceram ic ingot is heated to a softened state and pressed into the m old. Leucite-reinforced restorations give a very esthetically pleasing result with necessary strength for veneers, single crowns, and onlays. 2.72. Porcelain Components: 2.72.1.  Porcelain  Powders. The m anufacturer supplies feldspathic porcelain powders in the following four basic forms: AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  83 2.72.1.1. Opaque Porcelain. This porcelain contains a larger  percentage of opacifying agent (zirconium and tin oxide) and is quite opaque. It is used to mask out the color of the underlying metal. 2.72.1.2. Dentin or Body Porcelain. This porcelain matches the gingival two-thirds of a tooth. 2.72.1.3.  Enamel  or  Incisal  Porcelain. This porcelain is very translucent and is used to overlay the dentin porcelain and m atch the incisal  shade of a tooth. In addition to the different porcelain powders, each m anufacturer supplies a m ultitude of tooth shades. Even then, it is extremely difficult to make a complete match without the aid of stains or color modifiers. 2.72.1.4. Shoulder Porcelain. This porcelain is used in the facial m argin area to provide an esthetically pleasing alternative to the m etal collar. It is available in dif ferent porcelain shades to match the dentin and enamel components. 2.72.2. Stains and Color Modifiers. The stains and color m odifiers supplied in a kit of dental porcelain are m ade in the sam e way as the concen trated color f rits used to color the porcelain powders. A  color  modifier  is used intrinsically (internally) highlight body colors. A stain is more concentrated than a color  modifier and is used for extrinsic (external) coloration. Because stains are applied to  the surface of fired porcelain, they are usually mixed with low-fusing, air-fired porcelain. This m ixing allows the stain to fuse to the porcelain at a lower tem perature. Stains are used to color correct (alter shades) and characterize porcelain restorations. 2.72.3. Glazes and Add-On Porcelains. Technicians face m any challenges in m aking porcelain restorations. Either they cannot get a crown to  glaze (self-glazing) or they m ay need to m ake a simple correction to a contact area. For just this purpose, the m anufacturer supplies various correction powders as follows:  to obtain gingival effects or to 2.72.3.1. Dental Glazes. Dental glazes are clear, low-fusing porcelains which can be applied to the surface of a fired crown to  produce a glossy surface. Glaze powders are difficult to apply evenly and are often used to seal off a poorly baked restoration. An autogeneous (self-produced glaze) is preferred over the glass powders. Applie d glazes m ust have a coefficient of therm al expansion that matches porcelain. Otherwise, the  glass (glaze) will craze on the surface of the veneer. 2.72.3.2. Add-on Porcelains. Except for the addition of opacifiers and coloring pigm ent, add-on porcelains are sim ilar to glaze porcelains. Th ey m ay be m arketed as correction powders  which are norm ally air-fired porcelains. Add-on  porcelains enable m inor corrections to be made without the risk of high temperatures and the vacuum cycle. 2.73. Condensation. When porcelain is fired, the particles fu se, replacing some of the form erly water-filled spaces with viscous glass and leaving som e sp aces filled with air. W ith fewer air spaces, the porcelain is stronger and m ore translucent. Various  m ethods are used to condense the particles and reduce the number of air spaces before firing as follows: 2.73.1. Manufacturing the powders with various sizes of particles. 2.73.2. Closely packing the particles when making the restorations. 2.73.3. Controlling the atmosphere in which the porcelain is sintered (vacuum firing). 2.73.4. Eliminating the vehicles used to suspend the particles. 84  2.74. Various Methods of Condensation: AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 2.74.1. Condensation is the process of removing water and air from the powder-water mixture as it is applied to a m atrix or fram e. This is desi rable because water and air can produce voids in the fired porcelain. Various m ethods such as vibration, capillary action, pressure-packing, and whipping are used: 2.74.1.1. Vibration is applied by serrating or tapping with an instrum ent. It will eliminate large air bubbles or spaces, but is hard to control and  may unintentionally create minute cracks in the buildup.  2.74.1.2. Capillary action occurs when you blot, usually from  the lingual surface. In this way, the flow of moisture from the facial to the lingual draws the particles close together.  2.74.1.3. Pressure packing occurs when you smooth with a spatula or press with a clean tissue.  2.74.1.4.  Whipping  or brushing the surface with a large so ft brush fills in surface voids and removes loose particles. 2.74.2. The net effect of these four m ethods increases the am ount of surface tension within the porcelain buildup (Figure 2.5). Surface tension is th e actual driving force that tightly binds the mass together. Therefore, never allow the porcelain m ass to dry out during application. If the porcelain is dry, it cannot be condensed. Also, it is  difficult to rewet the buildup once it has been allowed to dry out.  Figure 2.5. Effect of Surface Tension on Condensing Porcelain.  Section 2H—Separating Materials 2.75. Introduction. Two materials are brought together in many laboratory procedures, but they must be prevented from sticking to each other. Therefore, a separating medium is applied to the surface of one of the materials before the two are brought into contact. 2.76.  Separating  One  Gypsum  Product  From  Another. W hen one gypsum  product is poured on another, the m aterials tend to stick or unite. Use products: the following separators to prevent union of gypsum  2.76.1.  Commercial  Separators. Com mercially available separators are form ulated to provide effective separation. However, what is equally im portant is that the film  thicknesses they create are almost nonexistent. If these separators are not available, liquid soap or floor wax should be used. 2.76.2.  Liquid  Soap. Ordinary soap is an effective separator and is often used in flasking operations. Brush it on evenly to avoid creating foam or bubbles. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  85 2.76.3. Liquid Floor Wax. Ordinary liquid floor wax is an effective separator for both plaster and stone. Apply it to a gypsum surface as a thin layer with a brush or a cotton pellet. 2.76.4. Petrolatum (Petroleum Jelly). The f ilm left by petroleum  jelly is too thick. Petroleum  jelly shouldn’t be used where m aximum accuracy  is essential (for exam ple, cast m ounting procedures, index fabrication, etc.). Dentists a nd technicians dedicated to accuracy as a work standard contend that petrolatum  has no place in the dental laboratory. However, petrolatum  is sometimes used in denture-flasking procedures. If petrolatum  must be used as a separator, spread the material in the thinnest film possible. 2.77.  Separating  Gypsum  Products  From  Acrylic  Resins. Both plaster and dental stone are quite porous. They are not suitable surfaces to cure acrylic resins against. A substance is needed to line the mold that seals off the pores.  Tinfoil and alginate separating mediums are the best m aterials for this purpose. 2.77.1. Tinfoil: 2.77.1.1. Tin is a soft, white m etal which is m ined as an ore. W hen refined and processed into foil, it is extrem ely m alleable. It is m anufactured by rolling it into thin sheets for dental laboratory use. 2.77.1.2. A thickness of 0.001 inch is used to cthickness of 0.003 inch is recom mended for covering the waxed-up denture. The foil should be cut into pieces of suitable size and shape and th e pieces burnished to the wax or on the stone cast with a blunt instrument and cotton roll. 2.77.1.3. A thin layer of petrolatum applied to the foil helps hold it in place on the wax denture or stone cast as it is being burnished. over the stone cast in denture flasking. A 2.77.2. Alginate-Separating Mediums (Tinfoil Substitute): 2.77.2.1. Alginate-separating m ediums are liquids consisting essentially of sodium or potassium alginate in distilled water. Glycer in and coloring m atter are often added. Because they are affected by m oisture, ensure surfaces co ated with alginate separating m edium are not brought into contact with water. 2.77.2.2. Use a soft brush to paint the liquid in one  or two layers on the cast and in the m old. Ensure the first coat is dry before applying the  next one. Once applied, the film  is quite fragile and easily scuffed. If a part of  the film lifts off the stone, rem ove the entire f ilm and paint the stone again. Pack the resin in th e mold within an hour after applying the alginate because the film tends to deteriorate if allowed to stand for a longer period. 2.77.2.3. Care must be exercised when a tinfoil subs titute is used. If gypsum  particles get into the bottle of liquid, it is ruined as a separator. Do not work directly f rom a bulk bottle; instead, pour what is needed into a sm aller container. Traces of tinfoil substitute allowed to rem ain on the necks of plastic teeth prevent bonding of the teeth to the resin of a denture base. 2.78. Lubricant Separators. When waxing a pattern on a die, use a separator to prevent the wax from  sticking to the die m aterial. A lubricant m ust neither block out the fine details  on the die nor affect the physical properties of the wax. The lubricants m ost  frequently used are com mercial preparations or substances like glycerol or mineral oil. If possible, use commercial separators to meet the high demands for accuracy in waxing and casting patterns. 86  2.79. Miscellaneous Separating Materials: AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 2.79.1. Talc (Talcum). Talc is a very fine, powdered soapstone. W hen sprinkled onto a cast and rubbed into its pores, talc is a very effective separator against heated shellac baseplate material. 2.79.2. Plastic Sheets (Film). Place plastic sheets between the halves of the flask so the resin does not stick to the bottom of the flask during trail packing.  Section 2I—Fluxes and Antifluxes 2.80. Fluxes. Fluxes are substances that are applied to a m etal to prevent the formation of an oxide film or to rem ove an already form ed oxide film . Borax  (sodium tetraborate), com bined with charcoal and silica, are the principal constituents of  most borax fluxes. Except f or containing f luoride salts, f luoride fluxes are similar in composition to borax fluxes. Fl uorides dissolve chromium oxide and are excellent fluxes for soldering base m etal alloys. Fluxes are used  in the dental laboratory in three different form s; paste, powder, and liquid: 2.80.1. Paste Flux. Paste flux is powdered flux that has been com bined with petrolatum . In this form, it is especially useful in soldering procedur es. You must cut the solder into small pieces and dip them in the paste before you place them  on the joint. If required, additional flux can be placed in the joint with a small instrument. 2.80.2. Powdered Flux. Powdered flux is the flux best suited for casting procedures. Keep it in a container with a perforated lid, such as a salt shaker, and apply it to the m etal in the casting crucible as needed. 2.80.3. Liquid Flux. To form a liquid flux, m ix powdered flux  with either water or alcohol. This form is particularly suited for soldering with an electric soldering unit. Dip the solder in the liquid flux before placing it on the joint. When soldering, more liquid may be added by picking up a few drops between the beaks of the soldering tweezers and placing the drops on the joint as needed. 2.81. Antifluxes. Some soldering operations require the solder to be confined to a very definite area. An example of this type of soldering is in building  up the contact on the proxim al surface of an onlay. It could be disastrous if  the solder is perm itted to flow onto the m argin. Substances used f or this purpose are called antifluxes. Ordinary pencil lead (graphite or car bon) is a good antiflux. Another antiflux can be made with chloroform or alcohol and rouge. Sh ave a small amount of rouge into a dappen dish and then add enough solvent to m ake a thin  paint. Apply the paint to the m etal in the desired area with a camel’s hair brush.  Section 2J—Alcohols 2.82.  Types  of  Alcohol. Alcohol is used in the dental laboratalcohol lamp and hand torch. There are several type s of alcohol. Som e are suitable for laboratory use and some are not. The physical characteristics of th e more commonly used alcohols are indicated in paragraphs 2.83 through 2.86. 2.83. Grain Alcohol (Ethyl Alcohol, Ethanol). This is a colorless liquid with a highly distinctive odor. It burns with a bluish flame and is a very satisfactory fuel for an alcohol torch. 2.84. Wood Alcohol (Methyl Alcohol, Methanol). This is a colorless liquid  with a pleasant odor. It is made either synthetically from carbon monoxide and hydrogen or by the distillation of wood. It is highly poisonous and burns in an alcohol lam p with a reddi sh-yellow, flickering flam e. When air is applied from the bellow in the hand torch, the flame beco mes slightly purple. The yellow flam e has the ory as a solvent and as a fuel for the 87 AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  advantage of being easy to see in ordinary daylight. Although the flame is not as hot as the one produced by ethyl alcohol, it is satisfactory as a fuel for either the torch or lamp. 2.85.  Denatured  Alcohol. Denatured alcohol is a m ixture of  ethyl alcohol and certain poisonous materials which are added to prevent its use as a  beverage. Methyl alcohol, acetone, benzene, and ether are som e of the com mon denaturing agents used. As  a fuel in the alcohol torch, it m ay burn easily, poorly, or not at all, depending on the volumuncertainty of its behavior, ethyl or methyl alcohol is a better fuel for the alcohol torch. 2.86. Isopropyl Alcohol. Isopropyl alcohol resem bles ethyl alcohol  very closely. It burns in an alcohol torch with a slightly m ore yellow and a som ewhat  more vigorous flam e than either ethyl or m ethyl alcohol. Under pressure from the bellows of the hand torch, isopropyl alcohol produces a blue flame, but tends to smoke badly when applied to wax. For this reason, it is not recommended for most laboratory or clinical uses.  Section 2K—Acids (Pickling Solutions) 2.87. Introduction: e and  type of denaturing agent used. Because of the 2.87.1. Acids are of interest to the laboratory techni cian because they are used in procedures to remove surface oxidation from the metal immediately after the castings have been recovered from  the mold. When they are used for this purpose, acids are called pickling solutions. 2.87.2. Acids m ust be handled with great care since they produce blisters and burns on the skin, ruin clothing, and corrode equipm ent. Baking soda  is the antidote for acid burns. It should be applied to the affected area im mediately after contact. If an antidote is not available, the affected area must be flushed with a lot of water. 2.87.3. Generally, acids are not used full strength inwater. When making up a pickling soluti on, always pour the acid into the water-- never pour the water into the acid. Failure to observe this rule may result in severe burns. 2.87.4. All pickling solutions except hydrofluoric acid glass stoppers and should be clearly labeled. One acid must never be mixed with another.  the dental laboratory, but are diluted with should be kept in glass containers with 2.88. Hydrochloric Acid: 2.88.1. Hydrochloric acid is a colorless, very corrosive acid. The fum es attack and corrode equipment, instruments, and fixtures. As a pick ling solution, it should be diluted with an equal part of water. On rare occasions, hydrochloric deposits caused by an overheated mold. 2.88.2. Hydrochloric acid slowly dissolves both platinum and palladium . For this reason, gold alloys should never be allowed to rem ain for  more than a few m inutes in acid. United States Pharmacopeia (U.S.P.) hydrochloric acid is 37 percent strength by weight. acid may be used full strength to rem ove sulfur 2.89.  Muriatic  Acid. Muriatic acid is another nam e for co mmercial hydrochloric acid. It m ay often contain impurities and m ay be slightly yellow. Like th e U.S.P. grade, m uriatic acid is supplied in a 37 percent solution by weight. It m akes a very satisfact ory pickling solution when diluted to half strength with water. 2.90. Sulfuric Acid. Sulfuric acid is a dense, oily liquid. It is  an excellent pickling solution for gold in a solution of one part water to one  part acid. It has an advantage over hydrochloric acid--it produces no objectionable fumes. It is a more effective pickling agent when it is warm. 88  2.91. Nitric Acid: AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 2.91.1. Nitric acid is a colorless liquid that m ay turn brown if it is stored for a long period of tim e. The discoloration does not change the properties of the acid. It is seldom  used in the laboratory because it dissolves gold alloys of high palladium content. 2.91.2. Nitric acid is som etimes used when a casting contam inated with copper deposits from  an unclean pickling solution cannot be cleaned with e ither hydrochloric or sulfuric acid. The solution used for this purpose is one part nitric acid to two parts water. 2.91.3. Never leave gold in nitric acid for more than a few minutes. 2.92.  Phosphoric  Acid. This acid rapidly dissolves dental cem ent and is very useful for rem oving facings or tube teeth from metal. It does not attack any of the commonly used dental alloys. 2.93.  Hydrofluoric  Acid. This acid should not be used except for dissolving porcelain veneers off metals. The fumes are dangerous if inhaled, and it is difficult to neutralize when it comes in contact with the skin. Magnesium  oxide ointm ent should be kept  close by for burns if the acid is used. There are commercial hydrofluoric acid substitutes on the m arket that are m uch less hazardous (for exam ple NO-SAN®, Triodent, Inc., Union NJ). 2.94.  Aqua  Regia. This is a concentrated solution m ade of  three parts hydrochloric acid to one part nitric acid. Aqua regia dissolves both gold and platinum . It is infrequently used to etch the inner surf ace of a gold inlay or crown to control the fit of the casting.  Section 2L—Wetting Agents 2.95. Overview: 2.95.1. When water balls up on a wax surface,  it is exhibiting a property called  surface tension. If a wax pattern is invested, the surface tension of  the water in the investment must be broken down in some manner. Otherwise, the casting will very likely have nodules on its surface because the investment has failed to adhere closely to the wax. 2.95.2. A wetting agent (debubblizer) is a liquid with a soapy feel used to lower the investm ent’s surface tension. W hen a wax pattern is properly prepared with a wetting agent, the investment flows evenly across the surface and into the small crevices of the wax. The resultant casting is free from nodules. In a sim ilar manner, a wetting agent a dded to the water to flush out a denture m old lowers the surface tension of the solution and enables it to clean the mold more effectively. 2.96. Types of Wetting Agents: 2.96.1. Commercial Brand Name Preparations. Commercially produced wetting agents should be used whenever possible. Their perform ance characteristics are very reliable. A technician has to have particular confidence in debubblizers for wax patterns. 2.96.2.  Hydrogen  Peroxide  and  Green  Soap. An especially good wetting agent for inlay and crown wax patterns is a m ixture of equal pa rts of hydrogen peroxide and green soap. The hydrogen peroxide, as it is received from the pharmacy, is diluted with an equal part of tincture of green soap. This solution can be stored in a dental cem ent bottle and used repeatedly. The sprued pattern can be placed on the crucible form er and  the crucible form er inverted onto the m outh of the bottle so the pattern is immersed in the solution. 2.96.3. Household Detergent. Research done by dental investigat ors at the Bureau of Standards has established that ordinary household detergent is  highly effective when it is added to the water 89 AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  used to clean denture m olds. The m old should be thoroughly rinsed with clean, hot water after cleansing because detergent residue may contaminate the denture resin.  Section 2M—Wax Solvents 2.97. Introduction. Even though a substance m ay be able to  dissolve wax, it m ay not be used for that purpose in dental laboratory technology. 2.98. Wax-Dissolving Substances: 2.98.1. Acetone. This is a colorless liquid with a particular odor. In the dental laboratory, it is used in making tacky liquid, which is used to hold partial denture  patterns to the investm ent cast. To prepare tacky liquid, dissolve plastic form s in acetone, making a liquid just slightly m ore viscous than water. Apply this liquid with a small brush to the exact area of the cast to which the pattern is to be applied. 2.98.2. Commercial Wax Solvents. These are commercially available preparations formulated to dissolve wax. They are not toxic, flam mable, or ha rmful to acrylic resin. They are very effective and much safer to use than many chemicals. Their use is strongly recommended.  Section 2N—Abrasives (Polishing Agents) 2.99. Introduction: 2.99.1. Abrasives are substances that wear away the surfaces  of softer objects. The speed of their action depends on the relative hardness of the two materials. 2.99.2. Abrasives are m ade into powders by crushi ng and sifting them  to produce the desired particle size. In dentistry, they are used as powde rs, cemented to the surface of paper and cloth in the form of discs, and bonded with binders to form grinding stones of various shapes. 2.99.3. Abrasive materials can be classified according to their hardness using a scale known as the Mohs scale. The Mohs scale is a com parative scale a nd a good indicator of the relative abrasive power of several materials used to smooth and polish in the dental laboratory 2.99.4. See Table 2.17 for a comparison of several commonly used dental abrasives with the Mohs number of those classified on the scale. This ta ble also shows the relative hardness and uses of abrasives.  Table 2.17. Types of Abrasives (Hardness and Use).

Incorporated into points, stones, or discs, then mandrel mounted and gripped by hand piece or lathe. Points, discs, and wheels used in a handpiece. 2.100.1. Chalk. Chalk is a soft, nongritty form  of calcium carbonate. A small quantity, made into a paste with water, is an effective high-shine compound for both gold alloys and acrylic resin. 2.100.2. Rouge. Rouge is a polishing agent used to im part a high luster to gold. It can be used to polish an acrylic resin denture, but it tends to coll ect in the crevices around the denture teeth. It is not recom mend for acrylic resin. Rouge consists of finely ground particles of iron oxide incorporated in an inert binder. Mixed with alcohol or chloroform, it is a very good antiflux. 2.100.3. Cuttlefish. Cuttlefish is an abrasive used to coat  discs used for finishing gold. It is finely ground cuttlebone that comes from the internal shell of the cuttlefish. 2.100.4. Emery. Emery is an im pure form of aluminum oxide found in nature as corundum . It is cemented to the surface of heavy pa per, and the paper is cut into discs which are used in the laboratory for smoothing and polishing. Emery is also used as the coating on the arbor bands used for trimming baseplates. 2.100.5. Tripoli. Tripoli material is obtained from a porous rock ground to a fine particle size and incorporated in a binder. It is supplied in stic k form and is excellent for smoothing both metal and acrylic resin. Tripoli is applied with muslin buffing or brush wheels mounted on a polishing lathe. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  2.100.6. Pumice: 91 is used in the form  of a finely ground 2.100.6.1. Pum ice is a form  of sand or silica which powder. Pum ice is supplied by the mice is extremely fine in particle size. Coarse, m edium, and fine grits are rou tinely used for a wide variety of smoothing and polishing tasks. 2.100.6.2. Pumice is usually m ixed with water to form  a thick paste. The paste is then applied to the work as it is held against a rapidly revolving muslin buffing or brush wheel. anufacturer in several grades. Flour of pum2.100.7. Quartz. Quartz is a crystallized f orm of silica.  It is used in a variety of grits for m any types of abrasives. A compact variety of quartz is made into whetstone (or Arkansas stone) which is used to sharpen dental cutting instrum ents. In the form  of powdered glass, quartz is glued to cloth and paper and used as a sandpaper disc. 2.100.8.  Garnet. Garnet is a crystalline m ineral abrasive  used to coat discs f or sm oothing and finishing operations. 2.100.9. Carborundum. Carborundum is a trade nam e for  silicon carbide. Many of the stones, mounted points, and discs used in the laboratory ar e made with silicon carbide. It is com posed of extremely hard, blue and black crystals that closely resem ble diamonds in shape. These particles are pressed with a plastic binder to form  stones and points, or they are cem ented to the surface of heavy paper to make discs. Stones and discs are used for smoothing and polishing. 2.100.10. Diamond. Many times harder than silicon carbide, the diam ond is the hardest abrasive known. Diamond particles are bonded together and used  in dentistry to m ake mounted stones of various shapes. They are also cemented to the surface of metal to make discs, wheels, and points.  Section 2O—Laboratory Gases 2.101. Introduction. Several kinds of gases are used for h eating and melting operations. Some, such as oxygen and acetylene, are stored in highly pressurizedWhen the containers are moved or handled, the caps must be securely attached. If the outlets are broken away from the tanks, the high pressures propel the tank like a high speed m issile. Therefore, the tanks must be secured to prevent their movement while they are in use. 2.102. Types of Gases:  containers with safety caps over the outlets. Natural gas is used in Bunsen burners and 2.102.1. Natural Gas (City Gas). When organic matter decomposes, it forms natural gas which is found in the ground in regions that produce oil. blowpipes for operations requiring heat. W hen it  is m ixed with com pressed air, natural gas produces a flame of approximately 2200 oF. This temperature is sufficient to melt most dental gold alloys, but not hot enough to m elt chrom e alloys . If an unusually large am ount (m ore than 1 ounce) of gold m ust be m elted, a hotter flam e m ight be necessary (for exam ple, natural gas-oxygen). 2.102.2.  Acetylene. Acetylene is a colorless gas with a garlic-like odor. Manufactured by the action of water on calcium  carbide, it is m arketed in pressurized tanks that provide the torch operator the assurance of constant line pressure. A cetylene gas is used with specially constructed blowpipes for casting and soldering. W hen acetyl ene burns in air, it produces a flame of approximately 3000  oF. This is hotter than the tem perature produced by a m ixture of natural gas and air. 92  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 . Huge quantities of2.102.3.  Propane. Propane occurs naturally in petroleum propane are produced when crude oil is refined. Propane stored  in pressurized tanks assumes a liquid state. As the pressure is reduced, the propane converts to  a gas. Propane and air produce a flam e greater in temperature than the flam e produced by natural ga s and air, but less than the flam e produced by acetylene and air. Propane is a cleaner fuel than acetylene, and its use is recom mended over acetylene. 2.102.4. Oxygen. The oxygen used in the laboratory is a  pure form of the oxygen that is found in the atm osphere. It is used to support the com bustion of other gases. Oxygen com es in highly pressurized containers, and proper safety precautions must be taken. If a leak occurs when oxygen is stored in the laboratory, the concentrated oxyge n intensifies the burning process. Therefore, the oxygen container m ust be stored outside the laborWhen pressurized oxygen is m ixed with natural ga s or with acetylene, it produces a flam e of a much higher tem perature than the flam e produced in com bustion of those gases supported by pressurized air. atory in a specially prepared, isolated area. 2.102.4.1. Natural Gas-Oxygen. Natural gas-oxygen flames are used to melt large volumes of conventional gold or to m elt ceramometals. Metals suitable for porcelain fusion have higher casting temperatures than conventional golds. 2.102.4.2.  Acetylene-Oxygen. Acetylene-com pressed air or an oxyacetylene flam e m ay be used to melt a chrome alloy. Most chrome alloys have melting ranges in excess of 2600  oF. An oxyacetylene flame reaches temperatures of approximately 6000 oF. Special torches are used to burn acetylene. Acetylene flam es must not be us ed on ceramic alloy because the flam es might change the alloy’s makeup which is precisely balanced for creating porcelain bonds. 2.102.4.3.  Propane-Oxygen. Propane-oxygen can be used to mconventional golds, ceram ometals, or chrom e alloys. Propane is cleaner and less hazardous than acetylene. Due to the risk of carbonizing the alloy, propane is recom mended over acetylene, even when m elting a base m etal alloy. A propane and oxygen m ixture produces a flame temperature of approximately 5500 oF. elt large volum es of  are arking  Section 2P—Miscellaneous Laboratory Materials 2.103.  Articulating  Paper  and  Articulating  Film. Articulating paper and articulating filmimpregnated with a colored dye that is easily transferred upon contact. Both are used for minterocclusal contacts when adjusting the occlusion of a fixed or removable prosthesis. 2.104.  Modeling  Clay. Modeling clay is pure kaolin (alum inum silicate) that has been m ixed with glycerin to form  m oldable dough. In the laboratory,  modeling clay is used to block out large tissue undercuts before a m aster cast is duplicated. It is also used to hold casts in position when they are mounted in an articulator. Because it shapes and m olds easily, modeling clay is suitable for m any other uses. 2.105. Cast Spray. Cast spray is used for coating the refractory cast to m ake a sealed surface to place wax or plastic patterns against. (Although the exact constituents are a trade secret, these sprays probably contain polystyrene plastic in a solution.) 2.106. Mouth Protectors (Mouth Guards). Custom mouth protectors (m outh guards) are m ade from polyvinyl acetate-ethylene blanks and preform s. This thermoplastic resin is m olded over a cast, using a vacuum-forming machine. Mouth protectors are worn dur ing sports participation to reduce injuries to the oral tissues, head, and neck. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  2.107.  Plastic  Patterns. Plastic patterns are plastic resin form s shaped as clasp arm s, lingual bars, retention forms, etc. They are used to m ake patterns for cast RPDs. Because they are soft and pliable at room temperature, plastic patterns can be easily adapted to the designed outline on the refractory cast. They are made of ethyl and m ethyl methacrylate with added plasticizers. (The exact com position of the plastics is a trade secret.) They must be stored in a cool place to prevent deterioration. 2.108. Ceramic Fiber Paper and Ring Liner (Formerly Asbestos Strip): 93 2.108.1. Except under highly controlled conditions, the us e of asbestos is being discontinued in many industries.  Ceramic  fiber  paper  is a com mercially available substitute for conventional asbestos stripping. Term s such as Nobestos ®, Kaoliner ® (both com mercial brand nam es), and “asbestos substitute” are used to describe this m aterial. Because this m aterial is used to line the investment ring in fixed denture and RPD investing procedures, the term ring liner is befitting. aterials and generally nonabsorbent, com pared to 2.108.2. Asbestos substitutes are stiffer masbestos. Therefore, their use in the dental laboratory is lim ited to investing procedures only. Other materials are now used to replace asbestos  for blocking out undercuts, lining crucibles, and insulating acrylic parts during soldering. 2.109. Quick-Setting Epoxy and Cyanoacrylate Adhesives: 2.109.1. The strengths of these products are so high and  their film thickness is so low that they are gaining increasing acceptance in dental laborat ory technology. Epoxy and cyanoacrylate glues are used to reunite gypsum cast fragments. 2.109.2. Epoxy glue contains enough body to be used as a blockout substance on fixed prosthesis dies. Painted on in a thin film , cyanoacrylate cement is an excellent die hardener and wax pattern spacer.  94  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 Chapter 3   ANATOMY OF FACIAL AND ORAL STRUCTURES Section 3A—Overview of Anatomy 3.1. Introduction. The study of anatom y has a language all its own, and its term s have evolved over many centuries. Many anatom ical term s are diffi cult to rem ember and pronounce. In order to communicate with other dental professionals, you must learn and understand the language and structures of oral and dental anatomy. 3.2. General Reference Terms: 3.2.1.  Anterior and  posterior  describe the front-to-back relati onship of one part of the body to another. Anterior is toward the front; posterior is toward the back. For exam ple, the ear is posterior to (in back of) the eye; the nose is anterior to (in front of) the ear, etc. internal  and  medial are synonym s as are  external and  lateral.  These term s 3.2.2. The words describe the sideways relationship of one part  of the body to another, using the m idsagittal plane (paragraph 3.3) as a reference. For exam ple the ear  is external (or lateral) to the eye because the ear is f urther from the m idsagittal plane. The eye  is internal (or m edial) to the ear because it is closer to the midsagittal plane. 3.2.3. The long axis is the longitudinal center line of the body or any of its parts. 3.3. Body Planes. The study of geometry shows that a plane is perfectly flat, is infinitely long and wide, and has no depth. For the purpose of this text, a plane is a real or im aginary slice m ade completely through a body. In anatom y, the slice is m ade to study  the details of the cut surfaces. The cut surfaces are called sections or views. Planes can pass th rough a body in an infinite num ber of ways. Com mon planes that produce standard views include sagittal, frontal, and transverse planes (Figures 3.1 and 3.2). 3.3.1. The sagittal plane parallels the long axis and  divides a body into right and left parts (Figure 3.1). A midsagittal plane divides bodies into equal right and left sides. 3.3.2. The frontal plane parallels the long axis and  divides a body into anterior and posterior parts (Figure 3.1). 3.3.3. The transverse (horizontal) plane divides  a body into upper and lower parts (Figure 3.2). More specifically, it is a slice that passes through a body at right angles (90 degrees) to the sagittal and frontal planes. 3.4. Bony Elevations: 3.4.1. Tubercle, eminence, and tuberosity all describe  rather small, somewhat circular areas raised above the general level of the surrounding bone. Th e person who originally described these areas specifically labeled an elevation of bone falling in  this category as an em inence, tuberosity, or tubercle. As far as relative shape and size are c oncerned, there is little to distinguish am ong these kinds of elevations. They just have to be memorized according to the names they carry. 3.4.2. A ridge is a liner elevation on example. 3.4.3. A process is a very prom inent projection fr om the central m ass of a bone; for exam ple, zygomatic process.  the surface of a bone or tooth. A  mylohyoid  ridge is one AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  95 3.4.4. A condyle is a rounded, convex, sm ooth surface on one of the bones that form s a movable joint. The condyle of the mandible is discussed in depth in paragraph 3.18.  Figure 3.1. Sagittal and Frontal Planes.  Figure 3.2. Transverse Plane.  3.5. Bone Depressions and Channels: 3.5.1. A fovea is shallow, cup-shaped depression or pit. An example of this is the palatine fovea. 3.5.2. A fossa is a more or less longitudinal, rounded depression in the surface of a bone. 3.5.3. A canal is a tubular channel through bone. Th e channel has at least one entrance and one exit hole. A canal’s entrance or exit hole is called a foramen. 3.6. Joints. Joints can be classified in a num ber of ways. One of the ways is the kind of m ovement the structure of the joint allows. The three kinds of joints found in the human skull are as follows: 96  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 3.6.1.  Synarthrosis  or  Immovable  Joint. Most skull bones are joined together along highly irregular, jigsaw puzzle-like lines called sutures. A suture joint is classif ied as a synarthrosis. Bones joined along suture lines in  the skull are not totally im mobile. Movement occurs, but it is very limited. 3.6.2.  Ginglymodiarthrodial  Joint. Literally defined, this is a freely m ovable, gliding, hinge joint. This relationship of one bone to another a llows the greatest range of m ovement of any joint temporomandibular  joint that type. The term  ginglym odiarthrodial specifically describes the unites the lower jaw with the rest of the skull. 3.6.3. Ellipsoidal Joint. This is the type of joint existing  between the occipital bone of the skull and the first vertebra of the spinal colum n. There  are two axes of m otion at right angles to each other in this joint, and both axes pass through the same bone. This arrangement enables you to nod your head and rotate it from side to side.  Section 3B—Bony Anatomy of the Head (Skull) 3.7. Introduction. The skull is that portion of the hum an skeleton that makes up the bony framework of the head. For descriptive purposes, the skull is divi ded into an upper, dome-shaped, cranial portion; and a lower or facial portion com posed of the eye sock ets, nasal cavities, and both jaws (Figure 3.3). The adult skull is composed of 22 bones (8 cranial and 14 facial). 3.8. Cranial Bones. The eight bones of the cranium  are the front al, parietal (right and left), occipital, temporal (right and left), sphenoid, and ethm oid.  NOTE: The shape and arrangem ent of these eight bones form a bony shell (cranium ) that has a central cav ity containing the brain. The arched roof of the cranial cavity is called the vault, and the floor of the cavity is called the base. 3.9.  Facial  Bones. The 14 bones in the facial portion of the skull are the m axilla, palatine, zygom a, lacrimal, nasal, inferior concha, vom er, and m andible.  NOTE: There is only one vom er and one mandible in a skull; however, the other facial bones are paired.  Section 3C—Cranial and Facial Bones of Primary Interest 3.10. Overview: 3.10.1. Artificial replacem ents for m issing natural teeth (dental prostheses) m ust be m ade to fit jaw contours and work in harm ony with muscle activity. Therefore, this discussion will center on those facial bones that give shape to soft tissues  within the mouth and serve as anchorage sites for muscles that move the lower jaw and give shape to the lower one-half of the face. 3.10.2. Cranial bones of primary interest are the frontal, parietal, temporal, and sphenoid. 3.10.3. Facial bones of primary interest are the maxilla, palatine, zygoma, and mandible. NOTE: It is important to rem ember the particular features of these bones for subsequent reference in this publication and, in fact, for your entire technical career. 3.10.4. Paragraph 3.11 through 3.14 highlight the particular features of cranial and facial bones. 3.11. Frontal Bone. The frontal bone is a single  bone forming the anterior of the cranial vault, the roof of the eye sockets, and a sm all portion of the nasal cavity. A  temporal line can be found on both lateral surfaces of the frontal bone. The line begins in the region of the eye socket and proceeds posteriorly, often dividing into superior and inferior tem poral  lines near the posterior border of the frontal bone (Figure 3.4). AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 3.3. Bones of the Skull. 97  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 98  3.12.  Parietal  Bones. Parietal bones are located between the  occipital and frontal bones to form  the largest portion of the top and sides of the cranium. The paired parietal bones are m arked by two semicircular bony ridges, the  superior and inferior temporal lines, which are the posterior continuation of the frontal bone's temporal line. The superior and inferior temporal lines rim the area of origin of the temporalis muscle (Figure 3.4).  Figure 3.4. Lateral View of the Skull (Selected Structures).  3.13.  Temporal  Bones. Temporal bones are the paired bones fo rming a portion of the right and left sides of the skull below the parietal bones. Th e temporal bones extend down onto the under surface of the cranium and contribute to the form ation of the cranial base. Each temporal bone articulates with the parietal above, the sphenoid in front, and the significant features of the tem poral bone are the m astoid process, styloid process, zygom atic process, glenoid fossa, articular eminence, and auditory canal or external auditory meatus as follows: occipital bone behind (Figures 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5). The 3.13.1. The  mastoid  process is a rounded, downward projection on the posterior part of the temporal bone. This process presents a roughened exterior surface for attaching several muscles of the neck. 3.13.2. The styloid process is a slender, tapering spur of bone projecting downward from the under surface of the tem poral bone. This process has sites of attachm ent for m ultiple m uscles and ligaments, which then go to the mandible, hyoid bone, throat, and tongue. 3.13.3. The zygomatic process is a projection from  the approximate center of each tem poral bone extending forward to form  a part of the zygom atic arch or cheek bone. This arch (or so-called AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  99 cheekbone) is not one continuous bone, but is m ade up of a num ber of parts. The zygom atic process of the temporal bone forms the posterior part. 3.13.4. The  glenoid fossa (mandiular fossa) is a deep hollow on the unde r surface of the base of the zygomatic process. The base of the zygomatic process is the place where the process originates from the central mass of the temporal bone. 3.13.5. The  articular eminence is a ram p-shaped prominence extending forward and downward from the anterior boundary of the glenoid fossa. 3.13.6. The auditory canal or external auditory meatus is a hole in the bone found posterior to the glenoid fossa. It leads from  the  outside surface of the base of the zygom atic process to the inner portions of the ear.  Figure 3.5. Lateral View of the Skull (Selected Features).  3.14. Sphenoid Bone. The sphenoid bone resem bles a bat with wings extended. It consists of a central portion or body which is situated in the m iddle of the base of the skull and three  pairs of processes: two laterally extended greater wings, two downward proj ecting pterygoid processes, and two lesser wings. The features of the sphenoid bone we will discuss are the greater wings, spine of the sphenoid, and pterygoid processes. 3.14.1. A greater wing (Figure 3.5) forms part of the surface contour of the cranium anterior to the temporal bone, and it also forms part of the eye socket. 3.14.2. The spine of the sphenoid is just inferior togreater wing of the sphenoid bone.

Maxillae or upper jawbones are paired bones that  unite in the m idline. They give shape to the m iddle face, form  a portion of  the floor of the eye socket and lateral wall of the nose, form  the anterior two-thirds of the hard palate, and support the natural teeth in bony sockets (Figures 3.6, 3.7, and 3.8). Each maxilla (singular) is irregularly shaped. It is m ade up of a body and four processes called the nasal process, zygomatic process, alveolar process, and palatine process as follows: 3.15.1. The  nasal process forms a portion of the lateral wall of the nose. Another nam e for the nasal process is the frontal process. 3.15.2. The zygomatic process of the maxilla joins with the zygoma which, in turn, unites with the zygomatic process of the tem poral bone to fo rm the zygom atic arch (or cheekbone). Although popular, the term “cheekbone” is incorrect because th is so-called single bone is actually m ade up of three parts. 3.15.3. The alveolar process surrounds the roots of the m axillary teeth, and the alveolar processes of both maxillae unite to form  the maxillary arch. A maxillary tuberosity is found on both of the distal ends of the m axillary arch. Proceeding ev en further posteriorly, the m axillary tuberosities abruptly rise into deep depressions called the  pterygomaxillary  notches (hamular notches). The pterygoid process of the sphenoid bone joins with the posterior aspect of a m axilla to form  a pterygomaxillary notch. The labial portion of the al veolar bone follows the contours of the natural AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  101 tooth roots. This is, when a root  is large and prom inent, the labial alveolar bone over the root is raised in comparison to an alveolar area between  roots. The labial alveolar bone covering the root of the maxillary canine stands out so much it has a specific name--the canine eminence. 3.15.4.

The palatine bones are paired, U-shaped bones located between the m axillae and the sphenoid bone (Figures 3.7 and 3.8).

Zygoma. The zygom a is situated laterally to the m axilla. W hen the zygom atic process of the maxilla, the zygom a, and the zygom atic process of  the tem poral bone are considered as a unit, the combination is called the zygomatic arch (Figure 3.4).  102  Figure 3.8. Occlusal View of the Maxilla. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  3.18. Mandible: the skull by the right and left 3.18.1. The mandible (Figure 3.9) or lower jaw is one  of the few movable bones of the skull. This bone gives shape to the lower portion of the face, provides sites of attachment for the muscles that make it m ove, forms the fram ework for the floor of the m outh, and supports the lower natural teeth. temporomandibular  joints. 3.18.2. The m andible is connected to Within each joint, the condyle of the m andible fits into the glenoid fossa on the underside of the temporal bone. In its m ovements, the condyle al so travels onto the tem poral bone’s articular eminence. 3.18.3. The articular em inence projects downward and  forward from  the anterior border of the glenoid fossa. (See Section 3F for a detailed description of the temporomandibular joint.) 3.18.4. The m ost prom inent features of the m andible are its horizontal body and two vertical projections known as  rami (one projection = ram us). The  body is curved (som ewhat like a horseshoe) at the posterior limits of the body, and the bone turns upward and slightly backward to form the ramus. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  103 3.18.5. As the inferior edge of the m andible is  traced from  anterior to posterior, the sudden transition between the horizontal body and re latively vertical ram us is known as the  mandibular angle (angle of the mandible).  Figure 3.9. Lateral and Medial Views of the Mandible.  3.18.6. Three processes are readily identifiabl e. The body of the m andible carries the  alveolar process, which surrounds the root structure of indiprocesses combine to form the mandibular arch. Each ramus ends in two processes, an anteriorly positioned  coronoid  process and the m ore posterior  condyloid  process. The deep, U-shaped concavity between the two processes is called  the mandibular notch. A condyloid process can be divided into a  condyle and a  neck. The top part of the condyle articulates with the glenoid fossa and articular eminence of the temporal bone to form the temporomandibular joint. vidual teeth. The right and left alveolar 104  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 3.18.7. The external surface landmarks of the mandible are as follows: 3.18.7.1. The m ental protuberance—a roughly triangul ar prominence occurring in the m idline near the inferior border of the mandible (chin point). 3.18.7.2. The m ental foramen—the anterior opening  of the m andibular canal. The foram en is usually found between and slightly below the firs t and second prem olar root tips. The inferior alveolar nerve passes within the m andibular can al and exits onto the exterior surface of the mandible through the m ental foramen to become the mental nerve. Compression of the m ental nerve by artificial dental replacem ents must be avoided because it will cause a feeling of pain or numbness. 3.18.7.3. The external oblique ridge (line)—whichexternal surface of the body of the mandible. This ridge begins at the lower anterior edge of the ramus, continues onto the body, and progressively thins out to end near the m ental foramen. The external oblique ridge is m ost prominent in the molar area and forms a distinct ledge with relation to the base of the alveolar process. This ledge is called the buccal shelf.  extends at an oblique angle across the 3.18.8. Internal surface landmarks of the mandible are as follows: 3.18.8.1. The mylohyoid ridge—located on the intern al surface of the m andible and occupying a position sim ilar to the external oblique ridge on the external surface. The m ylohyoid ridge passes forward and downward from  the internal  aspects of the ram us onto the body of the mandible and fades out near the m idline. This ridge  serves as the lateral line of  origin f or the mylohyoid muscle (the mylohyoid muscle forms the major portion of the floor of the mouth). 3.18.8.2. The genial tubercles—located slightly a bove the lower border of the m andible in the midline. These provide an attachment site for the geniohyoid muscle. 3.18.8.3. The sublingual fossa—a shallow concavity  housing a portion of the sublingual gland. This depression occurs just above the anterior part of the mylohyoid ridge. 3.18.8.4. The m andibular foramen—located in alm ost the exact center of the inner surface of the mandibular ramus. It opens into the mandibular canal. 3.18.8.5. The lingula—a bony prominence on the anterior border of the mandibular foramen. 3.18.8.6. The digastric fovea—a depression found on both  sides of the midline near the inferior lingual border of the mandible. 3.19. Hyoid Bone: 3.19.1. Any discussion of m uscles that m ove the lo wer jaw and their points of anchorage m ust include the hyoid bone. The hyoid is a U-shaped bone located anterior to the spinal colum n between the mandible and the larynx (voice box). 3.19.2. There is no joint-like union between the hyoid and any other bone. It is suspended between the m andible above and the clavicle (collar bone) below by suprahyoid (above the hyoid) and infrahyoid (below the hyoid) m uscle groups. Som e of the suprahyoid m uscles act to depress the lower jaw. Those suprahyoid muscles that act to depress the mandible are described in Section 3D.  Section 3D—Muscles of Mastication and Depressors of the Mandible 3.20. Muscle Fibers and Movements: 3.20.1. A person’s ability to m ove part of the body  depends on a group of specialized cells called AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  105 power. This variation in power is directly muscle f ibers. Muscle f ibers have the ability to  contract or shorten when stim ulated by nerve impulses. A typical m uscle consists of a m ass of m uscle fibers bound together by connective tissue. 3.20.2. A m uscle can generate varying degrees of proportional to the num ber and type of fibers within  the muscle that are contracting at any given time. Muscles can also stretch, but only because  a muscle located elsewhere has contracted and forced the extension. This performance of an action by one muscle that is opposed by the action of another muscle is called  antagonism. The sim plest way to express this is that m uscles can only pull; they cannot push. 3.20.3. The two ends of a voluntary m uscle usually a ttach to different bones. In som e instances, one end of a m uscle may attach in soft tissue such  as skin. Som e of the very sm all muscles that give expression to the face have both ends attachuscle attachment site that rem ains relatively stationary when the m uscle contracts is known as the origin. The m uscle attachment site having the great er movement during the contraction is called the insertion. A description of the m ovements, which take place as a result of m uscle contraction, is called the action. 3.20.4. Two muscle groups are responsible for execu ting the movements the mandible is capable of making--the muscles of mastication and the depressor muscles of the mandible. The muscles of mastication enable the lower jaw to m ake closing, opening, protrusive, and retrusive m ovements along with movements to the right and left sides.  The depressors of the m andible act to open the lower jaw wide--a function the muscles of mastication cannot perform. ed to soft tissue. In any case, the m3.21. Muscles of Mastication. There are four paired m uscles of m astication; masseters (Figure 3.10), temporalis (Figure 3.10), medial pterygoids (Figure 3.11), and lateral pterygoids (Figure 3.12).  Figure 3.10. Masseter and Temporalis Muscles.  106  3.21.1. Masseter: AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 3.21.1.1. Origin. The origin is the zygomatic arch. 3.21.1.2.  Insertion. The m asseter m uscle inserts on the lateral surfmandible (Figure 3.10). 3.21.1.3. Action. The primary function of the masseter is to elevate the mandible. The masseter may also aid in the protruding of the mandible. ace of  the ram us of  the 3.21.2. Temporalis: 3.21.2.1. Origin. The origin of this muscle is broadly spread out (fan-shaped) on the side of the skull (Figure 3.10). It covers the majority of the temporal bone and lesser portions of the frontal and parietal bones. The upper margin of the muscle follows the superior temporal line. 3.21.2.2. Insertion. The temporalis muscle inserts on the coronoid process of the mandible. 3.21.2.3. Action. The temporalis muscle acts in unison  with the masseter and medial pterygoid muscles to close the jaws. Very importantly, it also helps to retrude or pull back the mandible.  Figure 3.11. Medial View of the Medial Pterygoid Muscle.  3.21.3. Medial Pterygoid: 3.21.3.1. Origin. The origin of this m uscle is the  palatine bone and pterygoid process of the sphenoid bone (Figure 3.11). 3.21.3.2. Insertion. The medial pterygoid inserts on the m edial (internal) surface of the ram us of the mandible. 3.21.3.3. Action. The medial pterygoid acts with the m asseter and temporalis muscles to close the lower jaw. Som e authors claim  that wh en one m edial pterygoid m uscle contracts independently of its paired mate, it helps move the mandible sideways. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  3.21.4. Lateral Pterygoid: 107 3.21.4.1.  Origin. The origin of this m uscle is the  pterygoid process and greater wing of the sphenoid (Figure 3.12). 3.21.4.2. Insertion. This muscle inserts into the neck of the condyloid process of the mandible. 3.21.4.3. Action. When both lateral pterygoid muscles contract together, the mandible is pulled forward into protrusion. (Coincident with a protrusive movement, the mandible opens slightly.) When one m uscle contracts independently of th e other, the m andible pivots and shifts to the opposite side (lateral excursion).  Figure 3.12. Lateral View of the Lateral Pterygoid Muscle.  3.22. Depressor Muscles. The depressor muscles of the mandible all have the hyoid bone in common as an attachment site. W hen the hyoid bone is im mobilized by a contraction of the m uscles below it, the contraction of the depressor m uscles located  between the hyoid bone and the m andible pulls the mandible downward (opening the mouth). The suprahyoid depressors of the mandible are the mylohyoid (Figure 3.13), geniohyoid (Figure 3.13), and digastric muscles (Figure 3.14). 3.22.1. Mylohyoid Muscle Attachment Sites. The paired m ylohyoid muscles are attached to the mylohyoid lines on the internal surfaces of the mandible, the right and left mylohyoid muscles join in  the  midline  to  form  the  floor  of  the  mouth, and the posterior end of this m idline junction attaches to the hyoid bone (Figure 3.13). 3.22.2.  Geniohyoid  Muscle  Attachment  Sites. The two geniohyoid m uscles are found next to each other on each side of the m idline and directly on top of the m ylohyoid muscles. The sites of the attachment are the genial tubercles and the hyoid bone (Figure 3.13). 3.22.3.  Digastric  Muscle  Attachment  Sites. The digastric m uscle bundle is divided into an anterior belly and a posterior belly by a short tendon. This interm ediate tendon passes through a loop of fibrous tissue secured to the body of the hyoi d bone. The end of the anterior belly attaches 108  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 to the digastric fovea and the posterior belly fastens onto the mastoid process of the temporal bone (Figure 3.14).  Figure 3.13. Mylohyoid and Geniohyoid Muscles.  Section 3E—Facial Expression Muscles 3.23. Maintaining Facial Muscle Support: 3.23.1. Eight paired muscles of expression in coordination with the single  orbicularis oris muscle, control the m ovements of the lips and cheeks (Fi gure 3.15). The teeth and alveolar processes of the jaws support this group of muscles against collapse into the oral cavity. When natural teeth are extracted, facial muscle support must be maintained by replacing the missing teeth. 3.23.2. A person’s appearance can be dram atically affected by the position of the artificial teeth. Inadequate support m akes people look older; exce ssive support distorts a person’s features by making them  appear stretched. The m uscles of faci al expression also play an im portant part in forming the anterior and lateral portions of  maxillary and mandibular impression borders. This is because all of these m uscles can alter the depth of  vestibular sulci in one way or another. (See paragraphs 3.37.12 and 3.38.6.) 3.23.3. If impression borders are not properly extende d and shaped, the m uscles act to unseat the dentures. The influence of the m uscles of facial expression on denture borders is described in Chapter 7. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 3.14. Oblique View of the Mylohyoid and Digastric Muscles. 109  3.24. Orbicularis Oris: 3.24.1. This ring-like m uscle lies within the upper  and lower lips and com pletely surrounds the opening to the mouth. When the orbicularis oris contracts, it causes the lips to close. 3.24.2. The orbicularis oris has no r eal bony origin. Instead, it is entirely rimmed by the insertions of other m uscles of facial expression, m ost of  which do originate on bone. Certain m uscles of expression that insert into the orbicularis oris act to draw the corners  of the m outh backward, while some depress the lower lip and others elevate the upper lip. 3.25.  Levator  Labii  Superioris  Muscle. This facial expression m uscle  is flat and triangular. It is positioned lateral to the nose and has an origin by two  heads; the frontal process of the maxilla and the inferior margin of the orbit. These unite at one inser tion point in the fibers of the obicularis oris beneath the nostrils. The levator labii superioris m uscle acts to elevate the upper lip, widen the nasal opening, and raise the corner of the nose. 3.26. Zygomaticus Major Muscle. The zygomaticus major muscle is oblong, flat, and cylindrical. It is positioned lateral to and above the angle of the m outh. It originates at the zygomatic bone, lateral to the levator labii superioris m uscle, and inserts in skin just superior to and at the angle of the m outh. The muscle’s action is to draw the angle of the mouth laterally and upward. 3.27. Levator Anguli Oris Muscle. The levator anguli oris m uscle is flat and triangular. Its position is in the levator anguli oris fossa of the maxilla, covered by the levator labii superioris muscle. The levator anguli oris originates in the canine fossa and inserts at the angle of the mouth. It has three actions; it lifts the angle of the mouth upward, lifts the lower lip, and helps close the mouth. 110  Figure 3.15. Muscles of Facial Expression. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005   3.28. Risorius Muscle. The risorius muscle is flat and triangul ar. With a position lateral to the angle of the m outh, it originates in tissue over the m asseter  muscle and parotid gland. The risorius has an insertion at the angle of the m outh with the depressor anguli oris m uscle. Its action is to draw the angle of the mouth laterally causing a smile and dimple. 3.29. Depressor Labii Inferioris Muscle. With a flat and quadrangular shape, this m uscle covers the mental foramen. It has an origin  along the lower border of the m andible and inserts into the skin of the lower lip. When contracted, it acts to depress and invert the lower lip. 3.30.  Depressor  Anguli  Oris  Muscle. Shaped flat and triangular, the depressor anguli oris muscle covers the depressor labii inferioris m uscle. It also has an origin along the lower border of the m andible just beneath the m ental foramen. With an insertion  at the angle of the m outh, it acts to draw the angle upward. 3.31.  Mentalis  Muscle. The m entalis is a short, thick, cyprominence of the chin, deep to the depressor labii in ferioris muscle. Its origin on the m andible is also deep to the depressor labii inferioris. W hen contracting, it lifts and wrinkles th e skin of the chin and pulls tissue below the lips towards the lower anterior teeth. 3.32. Buccinator Muscle: lindrical m uscle positioned on the boney 3.32.1. The buccinator m uscle is a thin, broad band  of m uscle tissue that form s the innerm ost muscle wall of a cheek. 3.32.2. A buccinator m uscle has three sites of origin. They are the pterygom andibular raphe (ligament), which originates behind the m axillary tuberosity and inserts at the posterior end of  the AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  111 mandible’s mylohyoid line; the buccal surface of the  alveolar process in the m axilla immediately above the root tips of the molar teeth; and the external oblique ridge of the mandible. 3.32.3. The muscle fibers of the buccinator run parallel to the occlusal plane of the teeth and have a broad zone of insertion into the orbicularis oris at the corner of the mouth. Besides being muscles of facial expression, som e anatom ists cl assify the buccinators as accessory m uscles of mastication. 3.32.4. The prim ary functions of these m uscles are to  pull the corners of the m outh laterally and hold food between the teeth while chewing. 3.33. Platysma Muscle. The platysma is a thin broad band of m uscle that originates over the pectoralis major and deltoid m uscles. Its insertion is the inf erior border of the mandible and the skin of  the lower face. The platysma acts to draw the corners of the mouth down and aids in depression of the mandible.  Section 3F—Intraoral Soft Tissue Anatomy 3.34. Introduction: 3.34.1. The muscles that form the sides, entrance, and floor of the oral cavity are the  buccinators, orbicularis oris, and mylohyoids (in that order) (Figure 3.16). 3.34.2. The skin of the interior of the m outh is called oral mucous membrane or mucosa. In places like the alveolar processes and hard palate of th e upper jaw, the m ucous membrane is firmly and directly attached to bone. This kind of mucosa presents a stable surface. In other areas like the lips and the floor of the m outh, the m ucous membrane covers active m uscles that are constantly in motion. For example, the strong, muscular tongue is almost always moving. 3.34.3. A rem ovable prosthesis is built to use stab le mucosa for support and avoid areas of high muscle activity. There are soft tissue landm arks in the m outh that rem ain constant af ter natural teeth are extracted, and these landmarks are valuable aids in prosthesis construction.  Figure 3.16. Entrance and Sides of the Oral Cavity.  112  3.35. Mucous Membrane. Mucous membrane is the skin that lines the mouth (Figure 3.17 and 3.18). 3.35.1.  Mucous  Membrane  of  the  Alveolar  Process. The m ucous m embrane of the alveolar process is divided into gingiva and alveolar mucosa (Figure 3.17) as follows: AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 3.35.1.1. Gingiva. Gingiva covers the crestal three-fourth s of the alveolar process. There are two kinds of gingiva, free and a ttached. Free gingiva is about 0.5 m m wide and is found at the neck of a tooth. Attached gingiva is continuous  with the free gingiva and is tightly bound to bone. The attached gingival band varies between  2 and 9 mm wide; the widest part is found in the anterior regions. 3.35.1.2.  Alveolar  Mucosa. Alveolar m ucosa covers the basal one-fourth of the alveolar process. Alveolar mucosa is very mobile because it is loosely bound to underlying bone.  Figure 3.17. Mucous Membrane of the Alveolar Process.  3.35.2.  Mucous  Membrane  of  the  Hard  Palate.  The m ucous m embrane of the hard palate consists of attached gingiva. 3.36.  Vestibule. The vestibules consist of two potential facial aspect of the teeth and the internal surfacesbetween the lingual aspect of the mandibular teeth and the tongue (Figure 3.18). 3.37. Maxilla: (NOTE: See Figures 3.18, 3.19, and 3.20.) spaces. One vestibule is found between the  of the cheeks and lips; the other vestibule is found 3.37.1. Alveolar (Residual) Ridge. The alveolar (or residual) ridge is the rem nant of the alveolar process which originally contained sockets for na tural teeth. After natural teeth are extracted, the alveolar ridge can be expected to get sm aller (resorb). The rate of resorption varies considerably from person to person. 3.37.2. Maxillary Tuberosity. The m axillary tuberosity is the m ost distal (posterior) portion of  the maxillary alveolar ridge. 3.37.3. Ptyerygomaxillary (Hamular) Notch. The pterygomaxillary notch is a deep depression located posterior to the m axillary tuberosity. The de pths of this depression are part of  a series of  guides used to determine the posterior border of a maxillary denture. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 3.18. Lateral View of the Oral Cavity. 113  3.37.4. Palate. The palate extends from  the roof of th e mouth all the way back to the uvula as follows: 3.37.4.1. The hard palate is made up of the anterior two-thirds of the palatal vault supported by bone (the palatine processes of the maxillae and the horizontal plates of the palatine bones). 3.37.4.2. The soft palate is made up of the posterior one-third of the palatal vault not supported by bone. The soft palate is a m uscular extension from the posterior edge of the hard palate, and the soft palate is very mobile, especially while speaking and swallowing. 3.37.5. Incisive Papilla. The incisive papilla is the raised soft tissue covering the incisive foramen located in the m idline of  the hard palate, im mediately behind the central incisors. Because the incisive papilla is visible in the exact m idline of the hard palate (just behind the natural central incisors), it is a reliable guide for determining the midline relationships of upper anterior denture teeth. 3.37.6. Rugae. Rugae are irregular ridges of fibrous tissu e found in the anterior one-third of the hard palate. 3.37.7. Median Palatine Raphe. The median palatine raphe is a  slight tissue elevation occurring in the midline of the hard palate immediately over the median palatine suture. 3.37.8. Vibrating Line. The vibrating line is the line of  flexion between the hard and soft palates. The line m ost frequently falls between the two  pterygomaxillary notches on or near the palatine foveae in the m idline. When a den tist looks at a patient’s entire palatal vault, it is easy to see an abrupt transition between the unmoving hard palate and the highly mobile soft palate. 114  Figure 3.19.

The palatine fovea are two depressimidline on or very near the vibrating line. They are m ade by two groupings of m inor palatine salivary glands.  NOTE: The vibrating line helps the dentist determ ine the posterior border of an upper denture. In the absence of specific instruc tions from a dentist, the pterygomaxillary notches and the palatine foveae are the guide for determining the posterior border of an upper denture. 3.37.10.  Labial  Frenum. The labial frenum  is a narrow fold of oral mapproximate m idline. It extends from  the inner  surface of the lip to the alveolar ridge. W hen natural teeth are absent, the labial frenumdetermining the midline of the face.  3.37.11. Buccal Frenum. The buccal frenum extends from the mucosa of the cheek to the buccal aspect of the alveolar ridge. There are two buccal  frena. They are located on each side of the arch, usually in the first premolar region.  3.37.12. Sulci. The maxillary sulcus is a groove form ed by the mucosa of the cheek or lip and the mucosa at the base of the alveolar ridge. The porti on of the sulcus that lies between the labial and buccal frena is the labial sulcus. The part of the sulcus between the buccal frenum  and the pterygomaxillary notch is the buccal sulcus.

After natural teeth are extracted, the rem nant of the alveolar process is called the alveolar or residual ridge. As tim e  goes on, a residual ridge usually resorbs (gets smaller). 3.38.2.  Retomolar  Pad. The retrom olar pad is a pear-shape d mass of soft tissue located at the posterior end of the mandibular alveolar ridge (Figure 3.22). The retromolar pads are important for the following reasons: 3.38.2.1. When maxillary and mandibular natural teeth are brought together, a plane of contact automatically form s between the occlusal su rfaces of the upper and lower teeth (occlusal plane). When this plane of contact is projected  posteriorly, it intersects with the m andible at two points, one point on each side of the arch.  These points are about two-thirds of the way up the height of the retromolar pads. 3.38.2.2. The position of the pads rem ains constant  even after the natural teeth are extracted. Thus, the pads are an   excellent  guide for determ ining and setting the plane of occlusion between upper and lower denture teeth. 3.38.2.3. The pads serve as bilateral, distal support for a mandibular denture. Covering the pads with the denture base helps reduce the rate of alveolar ridge resorption.  116  Figure 3.21. View of the Labial Vestibules. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 3.22. Relationship of the Retromolar Pads to the Occlusal Plane.  3.38.3. Buccal Shelf. The buccal shelf is a ledge located buccal to the base of the alveolar ridge in the premolar and molar regions. Laterally, the shelf extends from the alveolar ridge to the external oblique line. A buccal shelf is barely observable increases in size as the ridge resorbs.)

In this case, reliefe nerve fibers exiting from3.38.5. Frena. The labial and buccal frena of the m andible are in corresponding positions to their counterparts in the m axilla. A lingual frenum  can  be seen in the floor of the m outh when the tongue is raised. The lingual frenum  is present in  the approxim ate midline and extends from  the floor of the mouth to the lingual surface of the alveolar ridge. 3.38.6. Sulci. Sulci rise and fall with facial expressions and tongue m ovements. The labial sulcus of the lower jaw lies at the base  of the alveolar ridge between labial and buccal frena. The buccal sulcus extends posteriorly from the buccal frenum to the buccal aspect of the retrom olar pad. The lingual sulcus is the groove form ed by the floor of the mouth as it turns up onto the lingual aspect of the alveolar ridge. 3.38.7. Floor of the Mouth. The anterior two-thirds of the floor of the m outh is form ed by the union of the right and left m ylohyoid muscles in the midline. The depth of the floor of the m outh in relation to the m andibular alveolar ridge cons tantly changes due to factors such as m ylohyoid muscle contractions, tongue m ovements, and swallowing activities. The posterior one-third of the lingual sulcus area is called the  retromylohyoid space. Distally, the palatoglossus m uscle shapes the area. 3.39. Tongue: 3.39.1. Overview:  3.39.1.1. The tongue is a muscular organ containing specialized cells for detecting the presence of chem icals in the food we eat (Figures 3.23 and 3.24). The brain interprets this chem ical detection process as  taste. The tongue’s m any different sets of m uscles enable it to m ake the complex movements associated with speaking a nd with chewing food. The constant m otion of the tongue represents a powerful force, and no artificial dental replacem ent can restrict that motion for long. 3.39.1.2. If a prosthesis is not constructed to wo rk in harmony with the tongue, the prosthesis will fail. For example, the tongue can maintain a denture in position or throw it out, depending on how the lingual surfaces and borders of the denture are shaped. 3.39.2. Muscle Groups. The tongue is animated by two muscle groups, the intrinsic and extrinsic, as follows: 3.39.2.1.  Intrinsic m uscles represent the substan ce of the tongue (Figure 3.23). They are responsible for the tongue’s ability to change shape. 3.39.2.2. Extrinsic m uscles originate at sites temporal bone, and genial tubercles (Figure 3.24). Extrinsic muscles proceed from their sites of origin and insert into the tongue’s m ass. The extrinsic m usculature enables the m ass of the tongue to move from place to place within the mouth.  like the hyoid bone, styloid process of the  118  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 3.39.2.3. Intrinsic and extrinsic m uscles do not act  in isolation from one another. The sm ooth, precise tongue movements we take for granted are  the result of finely coordinated contractions generated by appropriate muscles in both groups.  Figure 3.23. Intrinsic Muscles of the Tongue.  Figure 3.24. Extrinsic Muscles of the Tongue.  3.40. Major Salivary Glands: 3.40.1. The three pairs of m ajor salivary glands  are the parotid, subm andibular, and sublingual glands (Figure 3.25) as follows: 3.40.1.1. The  parotid glands lie in front of and below the ears.

The submandibular glands are found  on the right and left sides, between the m andible and the midline, m ostly below and partially above the mylohyoid m uscle’s posterior edge. Each submandibular gland discharges its secretion  through the subm andibular duct (W arton’s duct) which opens onto the floor of the mouth. 3.40.1.3.

The right and left tem poromandibular jo ints are the two places where the mandible connects with the rest of the skull (Figure 3.27). In  general terms, the temporomandibular joint is articular  eminence formed by the (paragraph 3.44) of the tem poral bone and by the  condyle of the mandible (paragraph 3.45) (Also see Section 3B.) 3.42.2. The fossa and em inence are separated from  contact with the condyle by an articular disc. The condyle stays in the fossa during ordinary opening and closing (hinge) movements. ssa during ordinary opening and closing (hinge) 3.43. Glenoid Fossa. The glenoid fossa is a deep hollow on  the undersurface of the zygom atic process of the tem poral bone. The condyle stays in the fomovements. 3.44. Articular Eminence. The articular em inence is a ram p-shaped prominence that extends forward and downward from the anterior boundary of the gle noid fossa. During forward (protrusive) movements of the entire mandible, both condyles leave their fossae and move onto eminences. In lateral movements, one condyle usually stays in a fossa and the other condyle moves out of the fossa onto its eminence. 3.45. Condyle. The condyle is the oval- or kidney-shaped  structure found on the end of the condyloid process of the mandible. 3.46. Articular Disc. The articular disc is a pad of tough, flexible fibrocartilage situated between the condyle and the glenoid fossa. The disc is a shock- absorbing mechanism. When the condyle m oves out onto the articular eminence, the disc travels with it. 3.47.  Synovial  Cavities. The synovial cavities are also referrecompartments. The upper synovial cavity is found between the top of the disc and the glenoid fossa.

Teeth, as they exist in the m outh, can  be placed in to one of three broad  groupings; maxillary or m andibular, right or left, or  anteriors or posteriors.  These groupings, detailed below, apply to both the natural dentition and artificial teeth. 4.1.1. Maxillary or Mandibular. Each person has two jaws, a maxillary (upper) and a mandibular (lower). The teeth in these jaws are called either  maxillary or mandibular teeth. The com bination of natural teeth and supporting  alveolar bone found in an uppe r or a lower jaw is called a  dental arch. When natural teeth are extracted, the  healed alveolar process is called the  alveolar ridge. Artificial teeth are set over alveolar ridges so they coincide with the original arch form. 4.1.2. Right or Left. If the two den tal arches are split dow n the m idline from front to back, the arches can be divided into uppeupper and lower left sections. Because one of these sections re presents one-fourth of the upper a nd lower arches taken together, each section is called a quadrant (Fi gure 4.1). If a tooth is located to  the left of the m idline in the upper arch, the tooth is part of the maxillary left quadrant (and so forth). r and lower right sections and  Figure 4.1. Mandibular Right Quadrant.  4.1.3. Anteriors or Posteriors: 4.1.3.1. Teeth can also be classified as anteriors  (incisors and canines) or posteriors (premolars and m olars) (Figure 4.2). A com plete adult na tural dentition has 32 teeth, and each arch contains 16. 4.1.3.2. The teeth in an arch are com posed of six anteriors (canine to canine) and ten posteriors (all teeth distal to the canines). Th ere are th ree anterio rs and  five posteriors in a quadrant. NOTE: Complete dentures for the upper and lower arches usually consist of 28 teeth. The third molars (4) are not used. 124  Figure 4.2. Anterior and Posterior Teeth. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  4.2. Names of Teeth. See Figure 4.3 and the subparagraphs herein for the names of groups of teeth.  Figure 4.3. Names of Teeth (Groups).  4.2.1. Anteriors: 4.2.1.1. Central and Lateral Incisors. The word “incisor” describes the function of incising or cutting food. In each quadrant, the two teeth near est the midline of the dental arches are called incisors. The first incisor on e ither side of the m idline is c alled a  central incisor. The second incisor from the midline of either arch is called a lateral incisor.  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  125 4.2.1.2. Canines. In each quadran t, the thir d tooth nearest the m idline of the dental arches is called a  canine. These teeth are used to tear food, and each dental arch has two canines. A  canine is so metimes called a cuspid  because its  cutting edg e is  a single, pointed elevation or cusp. 4.2.2. Posteriors: 4.2.2.1.  Premolars.  Premolars are so nam ed because they occupy an anatom ical positio n mesial to th e molars. (They are sometim es called  bicuspids because m ost have two  cusps on  their chewin g surfaces. ) There are eight p remolars, two in  each quad rant, which f unction as  seizing and grinding teeth. The two prem olars in any given quadrant are further called  first and second premolars, the first located immediately behind the canine. 4.2.2.2. Molars. Molars, the largest teeth in the dental arches, lie directly behind the premolars and function as grinders during m astication (chewing). Under normal conditions, there are six first, second, and  third molars. molars in each arch (three in each quadrant). They are called The first molar is the first tooth distal to the second premolar. 4.3.  Number  Substitutes  for  Teeth  Names.  Formal descrip tions lik e “m axillary right m olar” and  “mandibular left lateral incisor” can be time-consuming when many people must be examined in a short time. They can also  be too leng thy when space on fo rms is lim ited. Therefore, numerical sho rthand is often used as a substitute for com plete, formal tooth names. See Figure 4.4  (and paragraphs 4.3.1 and 4.3.2) for number substitutes 1 through 32 for the full complement of natural teeth. 4.3.1. Numbers 1 throug h 16 are in the m axillary arch. The upper righ t third molar is num ber 1, the upper right second molar is nu mber 2, and  as you pro ceed in con secutive order around th e maxillary arch to the upper left third molar, the last number is 16. 4.3.2. Numbers 17 through 32 are in the mandibular arch. The lower left third molar is number 17; the lower left second molar is num ber 18; and,  as you proceed around the m andibular arch to the lower right third molar, the last number is 32. 4.4. Structures of the Teeth: 4.4.1. A tooth is divided into two parts, the crown and the root (Figure 4.5). The anatomical crown is the part of the tooth covered with enam el. The root of a tooth is em bedded in alveolar bone and covered with cem entum. NOTE: In young people, areas of the anat omical crown are frequently buried in gingival tissue. As a pe rson gets older it becom es common for a tooth’s enam el to be completely exposed above the gingiva and to have root surface showing. 4.4.2. The term clinical crown is applied to the part of the tooth that is visible above the gingiva to include root surface. The bulk of a tooth is composed of a bone-like substance called dentin that is covered by enamel to form the crown and cementum to form the root. The line of division between cervical  line or  cementoenamel  junction. The dividing line is the crown and root is called the found in a somewhat constricted region on the tooth’s surface called the cervix or neck. 4.4.3. The tip of the root is known a s the apex. The tooth contains an  aggregate of blood vessels, nerves, and  cellular co nnective tis sue called  the  dental  pulp, which is housed within a pulp chamber and root canal of a tooth. 126  Figure 4.4. Number Substitutes for Teeth Names. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  127 4.4.4. Anterior teeth o rdinarily have one root ca nal; multiple canals occur in pos terior teeth. Th e nerves and blood vessels enter and leave the tooth through an opening called the apical foramen at or near the apex of the root.  Figure 4.5. Structures of Teeth and Supporting Tissues.  4.5. Supporting Structures of the Teeth. The supporting tissues of the te eth are collectively called the periodontium. The periodontium  consists of the alveolar process of the m axillae and m andible, periodontal ligament, cementum of the tooth, and gingiva, as follows: 4.5.1. Alveolar Process: 4.5.1.1. The alveolar process is the portion of the maxillae or mandible in which the roots of the teeth are embedded and by which tooth roots are supported. An al veolar process consists of three kinds of bone; the outer cortical plate, lamina dura, and spongy bone. 4.5.1.2. The outer cortical plate is a com pact layer of bone on the bone’s surface. The  lamina dura is a thin, dense layer of bone  that lines tooth sockets and is  a specialized continuation of the cortical plate. The spongy bone is the less dense, cancellous  bone representing central mass of the alveolar process. 4.5.2. Periodontal Ligament. The periodontal ligam ent is a th in, fibrous ligam ent connecting a tooth to the lam ina dura of the bony socket. Norm ally, teeth do not contac t the bone directly; a  tooth is suspended in its socket  by the fibers of the lig ament. This arrangement allows each tooth  limited individual m ovement. The fibers act as s hock absorbers to cushion the force of chewing impacts. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 4.5.3. Cementum. The cem entum is the only tissue consid ered as both a basic  part of the tooth and a component of the periodontium . For med  during the developm ent of the tooth’s root, cementum is a th in, calcified layer of tissue tha t completely covers the root’s dentin. It functions  as an area of attachment for periodontal ligament fibers. 4.5.4. Gingiva. The gingiva is the s pecialized mucous membrane covering the alveolar processes and encircling the necks of the teeth (Figure 4.6). It aids in the support of the teeth and protects the alveolar process and periodontal  ligament from bacterial invasion.  Healthy gingiva is pale pink, firm, and resilient. It is divided into two types, free and attached gingiva. 128   Figure 4.6. Free and Attached Gingiva.  4.5.4.1. Free ging iva is “free” to  the extent th at it can b e displaced. That is, it is not tigh tly bound to anything underneath it. Fr ee gingiva extends from the gi ngival crest to the bottom  of the gingival sulcus. At th e bottom of the sulcus, an  epithelial attachment joins the free gingiva to the too th surface. Th e  interdental  papilla is  the por tion of  the f ree gingiva  tha t f ills the proximal space below the contact areas of ad jacent teeth. It helps prev ent food fro m packing between the teeth. 4.5.4.2. Attached gingiva covers  the labial cortical pl ate of  the alveolar process. It is firm ly fixed to underlying bone. 4.6. Crown Morphology (Contours). There are alm ost no perfectly flat  or perfectly straigh t surfaces; most surfaces are curv ed. The contour  of a cro wn is a co mbination of convex and concave curves. A convex surface is one that is curved outward; a concave surface is curved inward. 4.7. Tooth Surfaces: 4.7.1. Proximal. A tooth has two proximal surfaces, one oriented toward the midline of the dental arch and another oriented away from the m idline of the arch (Figure 4.7). The m esial is the AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  129 proximal surface clos est to the m idline of the ar ch. The dis tal is th e  proximal surface oriented away from the midline of the arch.  Figure 4.7. Tooth Surfaces.  4.7.2. Facial. The facial is the surface  of a tooth that “faces” toward the lips or cheeks (Figure 4.7). When there is a requirem ent to be more specific, terms like  labial and buccal are used. The labial is th e surface of an anterior to oth that f aces toward the lips. The buccal is the surface of a posterior tooth that faces toward the cheek. 4.7.3. Lingual. The lingual is the surface of a tooth facing toward the tongue. 4.7.4. Incisal. The incisal is the cutting edge of an anterior tooth. 4.7.5. Occlusal. The occlusal is the chewing surface of a posterior tooth. 4.7.6.  Long  Axis  and  Axial  Surface.  The  long  axis of a tooth is an im aginary line that goes through the crown and root around which the substance of a tooth is m ost s ymmetrically distributed (Figure 4.8). Any surface  of a tooth that is parallel to the lon g axis is called an  axial surface (for example, mesial, distal, facial, or lingual surfaces).  Figure 4.8. Long Axis.  4.7.7. Dividing a Crown Into Thirds. The facial, lingual, mesial, and distal surfaces of a crown can be divided into thirds, both horizontally and longitudinally, as follows: 130  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 4.7.7.1.

Each facial or lingual surface m ay be divided into a m esial, a middle, and a distal third. 4.7.8.  Line  Angle. A line angle is an angle form ed by  the junction of two crown surfaces. It derives its name from those two surfaces. There are eight line angles per tooth. 4.7.8.1. The eight anterior tooth line angles are thdistolingual, labioincisal, linguoincisal, mesioincisal, and distoincisal. 4.7.8.2. The eight posterior tooth line angles are distolingual, bucco-occlusal, linguo-occlusal, disto-occlusal, and mesio-occlusal. the m esiobuccal, m esiolingual, distobuccal, e m esiolabial, m esiolingual, distolabial, 4.7.9.

Distinctive Crown Convexities: 4.8.1. Lobes. Lobes are one of the primary anatomical divisions of a crown; all teeth develop from either four or five lobes (Figure 4.10). (For exam ple, a ce ntral incisor develops from  four lobes while first molars develop from  five lobes.) Lo bes are usually separated by readily identifiable  developmental grooves. 4.8.2. Mamelons. Mamelons are sm all, rounded projections of  enamel from the incisal edges of newly erupted anterior teeth (Figure 4.11). The projections wear away soon after eruption. 4.8.3. Cingulum. A cingulum is found on the lingual aspect of an anterior tooth (Figure 4.12). It is a convex mount of enamel localized to the cervical one-third of the crown. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  131 4.8.4. Cusps. Cusps are cone-shaped elevations on the occlusal surface of a premolar or molar and on the incisal edge of the canine (Figure 4.13).  Figure 4.10. Lobes.  Figure 4.11. Mamelons.  Figure 4.12. Cingulum.  4.8.4.1. Canines hav e one cusp that represents  the tooth’s cutting edge. Maxillary prem olars and the mandibular first premolars have two cusps, one buccal and one lingual. The mandibular second premolar norm ally has th ree cusps, one bucca l and two lingual. Th e lingual cusps are subdivided into a mesiolingual and a distolingual. 4.8.4.2. Maxillary m olars have four  cusps, two buccal and two  lingual. The two bu ccal cusps are subdivided into a mesiobuccal and a distobuccal. The two lingual cusps are subdivided into 132  Figure 4.13. Cusps. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 a mesiolingual and a distolingu al. (Once in awh ile, the m esiolingual cusp of a ma xillary first molar carries an underdeveloped, rudimentary cusp called the cusp of Carabelli.)   4.8.4.3. The mandibular first molar has five cusps,  three buccal and two lingual. From  anterior to posterior,  the three b uccal cusps are subdivided into a m esiobuccal, a distobuccal, and a distal. The two lingual cusps are divided into a mesiolingual and a distolingual. The mandibular second m olar has four cusps called the me m esiolingual, and distolingual. siobuccal, distobuccal,4.8.5. Ridge. A ridge is a linear elevation found on the surface of a tooth as follows: 4.8.5.1. Marginal Ridge. A marginal ridge is a linear, rounded border of enamel that forms the mesial and distal m argins of anterior teeth (a s viewed from the lingual) and the m esial and distal borders of occlusal surf aces on posterior teeth (Figure 4.14).  NOTE: When wax patterns are d eveloped acco rding to the  additive  wax technique, the definition  of a m arginal ridge is extended to include mesial and distal cusp ridges of buccal and lingual cusps on posterior teeth (paragraph 4.8.5.3).  Figure 4.14. Marginal Ridges.  4.8.5.2. Lingual Ridge. The ridge of enamel that extends from the cingulum to the cusp tip on the lingual surface of most canines is called the lingual ridge (Figure 4.15). 4.8.5.3. Cusp Ridges. Each cusp has four cusp ridges radi ating from its tip (Figure 4.16). They are named according to the direction they take away from the cusp tip (mesial, distal, facial, or lingual). 4.8.5.4. Triangular Ridge: 4.8.5.4.1. The occlusal surface of a cusp is composed of a mesial and a distal incline (Figure AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  133 4.17). These two inclines m eet to form a triangular ridge of enamel that descends fro m the tip of the c usp to the c entral portion of the occlusal su rface. A triangu lar ridge is eithe r a facial or a lingual cusp ridge, depending on where the cusp is located.  Figure 4.15. Lingual Ridge.  Figure 4.16. Cusp Ridges.  Figure 4.17. Triangular Ridge.  4.8.5.4.2. Cusps are described in som e m ouths as  being “pointy” and in others as being “flat” or “blunt.” Most point y posterior teeth have high cusp  angle values (Figure 4.18). A AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 cusp angle is the angle that a triangular ridge ma kes with a plane perpendicular to the long axis of the tooth.  Figure 4.18. Cusp Angle. 134   4.8.5.5. Transverse Ridge. A tran sverse ridge is the un ion of a buccal and lingual triangular ridge that crosses th e surface of a p osterior tooth tran sversely (roughly 90 degrees to both th e buccal and lingual tooth surfaces) (Figure 4.19).  Figure 4.19. Transverse Ridge.  4.8.5.6. Oblique Ridge. The only tooth on which an obliq ue ridge is found is the m axillary molar (Figure 4.20). An oblique ridge consists  of a union between the triangular ridge of the distobuccal cusp and the distal cusp ridge of the mesiolingual cusp. 4.8.6. Cusp Inclines. A cusp incline or inclined plane is the sloping area f ound between two cusp ridges. To name an incline, you must combine the names of the cusp ridges that define a large part of its borders, for example, the distolingual incline of the buccal cusp of a maxillary first premolar (Figure 4.16). 4.9. Distinctive Crown Concavities: 4.9.1. Fossae: AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 4.20. Oblique Ridge. 135   Figure 4.21. Lingual Fossa. 4.9.1.1.  Lingual  Fossa. The lingual fossa is an irregumesial marginal ridge, distal marginal ridge, cingulum , and incisa l edge of the lingu al surface of an incisor tooth (Figure 4.21). Lingual fossaridge of a canine tooth. e are also found on both sides of the lingual lar, rounded concavity bound by the  4.9.1.2.  Triangular  Fossa. Triangu lar fossae are located adjacen t to m arginal rid ges on the occlusal surfaces of posterior teeth (Figure 4.22 ). There are two kinds of triangular fossae, a mesial and a distal.  Figure 4.22. Triangular Fossa.  4.9.1.3. Central Fossa. A central fossa is a centrally lo cated depression or concavity found on the occlusal surface of m olars an d m andibular second p remolars (F igure 4.23 ). The other  premolars have mesial and distal triangular fossae, but do not have a central fossa. 136  Figure 4.23. Central Fossa. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  4.9.2. Developmental Groove. A developmental groove is the j unction line between the inclined walls of adjacent cu sp or ridg es (Figure 4.24). Developmental grooves represent lines of union between lobes of the crown during its for mation. These grooves appear on labial, occlusal, buccal, and lingual surfaces, and they are least apparent on the labial aspect of anteriors.  Figure 4.24. Developmental Grooves.  4.9.3. Supplemental Groove. A supplemental grove is a minor, auxiliary groove that branches off from a m uch more prominent developmental groove (F igure 4.25). Supplem ental grooves do not represent the junction of primary tooth parts. 4.9.4. Fissure. A fissure is a linear f ault that sometimes occurs in a developmental groove (Figure 4.26). A fissure represents a lack of union between the inclined walls of a sulcus. 4.9.5. Pit. A pit is a sm all, pinpoint fault on the surface of a tooth us ually found at the end of a  developmental groove or where two fissures intersect.  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 4.25.

Teeth m ake contact with one a nother at points or areas on the greatest contour of their proxim al surfaces (Fig ure 4.33). T he places where ad jacent teeth m ake point contact are called contact points. Contact points become wider  and flatter in time from wear that occurs during functional m ovements (chewi ng) or parafunctional m ovements (grinding). A flattened contact point is called a contact area. 4.11.2. Embrasure: 4.11.2.1. An e mbrasure is a space diverg ing from  the contacting p roximal surfaces of two adjacent teeth (Figure 4.34). There are four of these spaces or embrasures recognized. They are the facial, lingual, gingival, and occlusal or in cisal (depending on whether they are posterior or anterior teeth). 4.11.2.2. The gingival embrasure is located cervical to the contacting areas of adjacent teeth. A gingival embrasure has other nam es like  cervical embrasure, apical embrasure, interproximal space, and septal space. 4.11.2.3.

Circular (Round). The occlusal surfaces of the lower premolars are circular in outline. 4.12.2. Rectangular. The occlusal surfaces of the lower second molar and the upper premolars are often described as being rectangular or oblong in outline. 4.12.3. Trapezoid. A trapezoid  is a plain  four-sided figure  with two parallel sides. The occlusal surface of the lower first molar is said to be trapezoidal in outline. 4.12.4.  Rhomboid. A r homboid is shaped as an equilateral parallelogram  with two opposing oblique angles. The occlusal surfaces of the upper molars are rhomboidal in outline.

The maxillary central in cisor (Figure 4.36) is the tooth nearest the median line in the maxillary arch. al surface is convex, 4.14.1. Facial Surface. The facial surface is broad and resembles a thumbnail in outline. The right maxillary central incisor can be distinguished from  the left m axillary central incisor because the distoincisal angle is more rounded than the mesioincisal angle and  the incisal edge slopes slightly gingivally in a m esiodistal direction. The faciboth m esiodistally and incisocervically. Three distinct lobes may be seen in the inc isal portion, and they are separated by two developmental grooves. 4.14.2. Lingual Surface. The lingual surface ap pears slightly smaller than the facial surface, an d the cervical portion is narrower. The large lingual fossa is bounded by prominent mesial and distal marginal ridges. There is a cingulum  in the cervical portion, and there may be a pit in conjunction with the cingulum. 4.14.3. Incisal Edge. Viewed on end, the incisal edge appears  nearly straight. Most of the wear is on the lingual portion of the edge, so the edge  becomes beveled lingually. The cingulum lies more to the distal side of the tooth than to the mesial side. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  141 4.14.4. Mesial Surface. The m esial surface loo ks like a wedge.  The apex of the w edge is at th e incisal edge of the tooth. The facial outline isconcave from the incisal edge to the cingulum margin. 4.14.5. Distal Surface.

Figure 4.36. Maxillary Central Incisor.  4.15. Maxillary Lateral Incisor. The maxillary lateral incisor (Figure 4.37) is the second tooth from the median line in the maxillary arch. It resembles the central incisor, but is smaller in all dimensions. 4.15.1.  Facial  Surface. The facial s urface is narrower and shorte r than the central inciso r. The distoincisal angle is m ore rounded  than the m esioincisal angle. Th e distal portion of the incisal ridge slopes upward toward the distoincisal angle. The facial surface is convex. 144  Figure 4.37. Maxillary Lateral Incisor. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  4.15.2.  Lingual  Surface. The lingu al su rface resem bles th e f acial su rface in perip heral outlin e except that the cervical portion is n arrower. The features of this surface vary considerably from one individual to another. Proportio nally, the lingual surface characteristics of a lateral incisor are more marked than similar features on a central incisor. 4.15.3. Incisal Edge. Viewed on end, the incisal edge appe ars nearly straight. The cingulum  lies slightly to the distal side of the tooth. 4.15.4. Mesial Surface. The mesial surface, like the  central incisor’s, is wedge shaped. The apex of the wedge is at the in cisal edge. The incisal edge lies somewhat further lingually than it does in the central incisor. 4.15.5. Distal Surface. The distal s urface resembles the mesial  surface, but the  facial outline is more convex and the incisal portion of the lingual outline is more concave. 4.16. Maxillary Canine. The m axillary canine (Figure 4.38) is the  third tooth from the m edian line in the maxillary arch. It is  located at the corner of the arch, and its long root is em bedded in the canine (cuspid) eminence. The maxillary canine is usu ally the  longest tooth in eith er jaw. It is c alled canine because it resembles a dog’s tooth. (It is sometimes referred to as a cuspid because it has one cusp on its incisal edge.)  Figure 4.38. Maxillary Canine.  4.16.1. Facial Surface. The incisal portion of th e facial surface is much broader than the cervical portion. The mesial and distal cusp ridges of the incisal edge slope downward toward the center to meet at the tip of the cu sp. The distal slope is longer than th e mesial slope. The  facial surface is convex. It is divided into mesial and distal surfaces by the facial ridge. The ridge extends from the tip of the cusp to the point of greatest convexity. The mesiofacial surface of the canine falls on the curve of th e arch  form ed by the an terior teeth.   The dis tofacial surface conform s to the bu ccal alignment of posterior teeth. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  145 4.16.2.  Lingual  Surface. The lin gual surf ace resem bles the f acial s urface in outlin e, but the cervical portion is narrower. The me sial and distal m arginal ridges are prom inent, and a strong lingual ridge runs from  the tip of the cusp to the cingulum. The m axillary canine has the larges t cingulum of all the anterior teeth. 4.16.3. Incisal Edge. Viewed on end, the incisal edge is slightly curved. The lingual portion of the tooth appears rugged; the ridges and grooves are very well defined. 4.16.4. Mesial Surface. The m esial surface is roughly trian gular. From this asp ect, the canin es appears much thicker than the incisors. 4.16.5.  Distal  Surface. The dis tal surface is  s haped very   much like the m esial s urface, but is shorter because the distal portion of the incisal edge slope s f urther ce rvically th an the m esial portion. 4.17. Maxillary First Premolar. The maxillary first premolar (Figure 4.39) is the fourth tooth fro m the median line in the m axillary arc h. It is the f irst  posterior tooth. The prem olars are som etimes called bicuspids because most of them have two cusps.  Figure 4.39. Maxillary First Premolar.  sembles the can ine in o utline, but it is shorter 4.17.1.  Facial  Surface. The facial surface reocclusocervically and not quite as convex. The slabout equal in length. The facial ridge is prominent. 4.17.2.  Lingual  Surface. The lin gual su rface is m uch s maller than  the facial surface in all dimensions, but is generally similar in outline. The lingual cusp is shorter than the facial cu sp and is located mesial to the midline of the tooth. 4.17.3. Occlusal Surface: opes of the m esial and distal cusp ridges are 4.17.3.1. The occlusal surface is broader facially than lingually. There are two cusps, the facial cusp and the lingual cusp. 4.17.3.2. The mesial and distal marginal ridges correspond to the marginal ridges of the anterior teeth. The m esial and distal proxim al surfaces  converge toward the lingual. Of the two, the distal surface has the greatest convergence. 4.17.3.3. The mesial fossa is distal to the m esial marginal ridge and the distal fossa is m esial to the distal marginal ridge. The facial and lingua l triangular ridges extend from  the tips of the cusps to the central groove. This groove ends at the mesial and distal pits. The mesial and distal marginal grooves arise from the mesial and distal pits and end on the mesial and distal surfaces, respectively. 146  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 4.17.4.  Mesial  Surface. The m esial surface is roughly recta ngular in outlin e. The facial and lingual outlines are con vex. The mesial surface is  generally convex except for a concave area o n the facial p ortion of th e surface ab ove the cerv ical margin. The m esial marginal groove extend s onto the mesial surface. 4.17.5.  Distal  Surface. The distal surface res embles the m esial surface, but does  not have the concave area above the cervical margin. 4.18. Maxillary Second Premolar. The m axillary second prem olar is  the fifth tooth from  the m edian line in the m axillary arch. It closely resem bles th e first prem olar, but it is m ore rounded in outlin e (Figure 4.40).  Figure 4.40. Maxillary Second Premolar.  4.18.1. Facial Surface. The facial s urface is slightly sm aller than the facial surface of the first premolar. The slopes of the m esial and distal cusp ridges are abou t eq ual in  leng th. The f acial surface is convex, and the facial ridge is prominent. 4.18.2.  Lingual  Surface. The lingual surface is only slightly sho rter than the facia l surfac e because the facial and lingual cusps are nearly  equal in  length.  This surface is also slightly  narrower than the facial surface. The lingual surface  is smoothly convex in all directions, and its greatest convexity is in the cervical third. 4.18.3. Occlusal Surface. In general, the occlus al surface h as the sam e form and features as the  occlusal surface of the first prem olar. However,  the facial and lingual portions are m ore nearly equal in size and the mesial and distal pits are closer together. 4.18.4. Mesial Surface. The m esial surface is wider in  the cervical portion than in the o cclusal portion. The facial outline is slightly convex excep t in the central portion. The lingual outline is convex. Both cusps appear more rounded that the cusps of the first premolar. 4.18.5. Distal Surface. The distal surface is slightly shorter than the mesial surface, but it is about the same width. The facial and lingual outlines are convex. The surface is smoothly convex except at the distal marginal groove. 4.19. Maxillary First Molar. The maxillary first molar (Figure 4.41) is the sixth tooth from the median line in the maxillary arch. It is the largest tooth in either arch. The maxillary and mandibular first molars are often called 6-year molars.  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 4.41. Maxillary First Molar. 147  e surface has three ridges. A ridge extend4.19.1. Facial Surface. The facial surface is roughly heart-shaped in outline. The mesiofacial and distofacial cusps form the occlusal border, and the  facial groove divides th e cusps. The surface is generally convex except at this groove. Ths perpendicularly from the tip of each cusp and a third ridge extends h orizontally in the cervical  portion. 4.19.2. Lingual Surface. The m esiolingual and distolingual cu sps outline the occlusal border of the lingual surface. The m esiolingual cusp  is the la rgest o f the posterior teeth. Qu ite often  th is tooth has a residual fifth cusp, the cusp of Carabelli, whrface of the  mesiolingual cusp. When present, this cusp is sh orter than the other cusps and does not for m part of the occlusal surface. The lingual surface is generally convex except at the distolingual groove. 4.19.3. Occlusal Surface. The occlusal surface is  roughly rhom boidal. The cusps are large and prominent, with broad surfaces bro ken up into  rugged rid ges and well-d efined grooves. The mesiolingual cusp is the largest of the cusps. The distolingual groove separates it from  the distolingual cusp. An oblique ridge connects the m esiolingual and  distofacial cusps. It runs parallel to the distolingual gr oove. The facial groove runs from   the central pit onto the facial surface. The mesial and distal pits lie near the mesial and distal marginal ridges, respectively. 4.19.4. Mesial Surface. The m esial marginal groove, which star ts at the m esial pit, notches the  occlusal border of the mesial surface. A double c onvexity marks the lingual margin if the cusp of Carabelli is present. 4.19.5.  Distal  Surface. The distal m arginal gr oove, which starts at the occlusal border of the distal surface. ich is on the lingual sudistal pit, notches the 4.20. Maxillary Second Molar. The maxillary second molar (Figure 4.42) is the seventh tooth from the median line in the maxillary arch. It is quite similar to the first molar, but it is smaller. This tooth is often called the 12-year molar.  Figure 4.42. Maxillary Second Molar.  148  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 4.20.1. Facial Surface. The facial s urface of the maxillary second molar is less sym metrical than the first m olar. The m esiofacial cu sp is larger than th e distofacial cusp. Th e facial groove lies nearer to the distal su rface than it does to the mesial surface. The same three ridges appear on the facial surface as appear on the facial surface of the first molar (paragraph 4.19.1). 4.20.2. Lingual Surface. The occlusal border of  the lingual  surface is marked by two cusps, the mesiolingual and the distolingual. T he mesiolingual cusp is the largest. ( NOTE: The distolingual cusp is not fully reproduced in artificial teeth. For this reason, many of these artificial teeth appear triangular when viewed occlusally.) The second  molar has no cusp of Carabelli. The cervical border is nearly straight, and the lingual surface is generally convex. 4.20.3. Occlusal Surface. The occlu sal surface is very sim ilar to the oc clusal surface of the first molar (paragraph 4.19.3). 4.20.4. Mesial Surface. The mesial surface is fairly symm etrical in outline. The m esiofacial cusp is slightly longer than th e mesiolingual cusp. The facial outlin e is nearly strai ght, but the lingual outline is distinctly convex. 4.20.5.  Distal  Surface. The distal surface is som ewhat sm aller than  the m esial surface. T he distofacial cusp is longer than  the distolingual cusp. The facial  outline appears less convex than it does from the mesial aspect. 4.21. Mandibular Central Incisor. The mandibular central incisor (Fig ure 4.43) is the first tooth from the median line in the m andibular arch. As described in the paragraphs below, it is the smallest tooth in either arch and the simplest in form:  Figure 4.43. Mandibular Central Incisor.  4.21.1.  Facial  Surface. The facial surface is widest at the incisal ed ge. The m esioincisal a nd distoincisal angles are  almost 90-degree ang les. The mesial and distal borders ar e almost parallel in the incisal portion. In their  middle and cervical portions, the out lines converge but do not m eet. The facial surface is co nvex. There are th ree lobes separated by two developm ental grooves. The grooves are more faint than they are in the maxillary central incisor, often disappearing entirely. 4.21.2. Lingual Surface. The lingual surface is quite sim ilar in outline to the facial surface, but the cervical portion is more na rrow. The incisal portion of the lingual surface is  concave. T he cingulum, which begins fairly close to the cervical  margin, blends more smoothly with the rest of the lingual surface than it does on the maxillary incisors. 4.21.3. Incisal Edge. Viewed on end, the incisal  edge appears nearly stra ight; and, in adults, the edge is worn smooth and sharp. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  149 4.21.4. Mesial Surface. The m esial surface is wedge shap ed. The facial outlin e is convex. Th e lingual outline is concave in the incisal and m iddle portions and convex in the cervical portion. The mesial surface is almost flat incisogingivally. 4.21.5. Distal Surface. The distal surface closely resembles the mesial surface. 4.22.  Mandibular  Lateral  Incisor. The m andibular lateral incisor (F igure 4.44) is the second tooth from the median line in the m andibular arch. Although it resem bles the mandibular central incisor, it is wider and longer:  Figure 4.44. Mandibular Lateral Incisor.  4.22.1.  Facial  Surface. The facial surface is less symm etrical than  the facial su rface of the  mandibular central incisor. The incisal edge slopes upward toward the mesioincisal angle, which is slightly less than 90 degrees. The distoincisal angl e is rounded. The m esial border is more nearly straight than the distal border. (T he distal bor der is slightly convex in  the incisal portion and slightly concave in the middle and cervical portions.) The facial surface is convex. 4.22.2. Lingual Surface. The lingual surface is si milar in outline to the f acial surface. The mesial and distal borders converge more sharply than they do on the facial surface. The incisal portion of the lingual surface is co ncave. The cingulum  is quite large,  but blends sm oothly with the rest of the surface. 4.22.3.  Incisal  Edge. Viewed on end, the incisal edge form s  a nearly straight  line that slants lingually to ward its distal end. Th is is b ecause the d istal portion   of the facial su rface is m ore convex than the mesial portion. 4.22.4.  Mesial  Edge. The m esial surface is wedge shaped . The facial outline is convex. The lingual outline is concave in the incisal portion and convex in the middle and cervical portions. 4.22.5.  Distal  Edge.

It is similar to the maxillary canine, but more narrow.   150  Figure 4.45. Mandibular Canine. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  4.23.1.  Facial  Surface. The facial s urface is as ymmetrical in  outline. The distal p ortion of th e surface is sh orter and b roader than the m esial portion. Consequently, the distal cusp ridge of the  incisal edge is much longer than the mesial edge. The mesial border is slightly convex. The upper portion of the distal border is  very convex, and the lower portion is  slightly concave. The three lobes are quite distinct. The central lobe forms the strong facial ridge. 4.23.2. Lingual Surface. The lingual surface is sim ilar in outlin e to the facial surface except th e cervical portion is more narrow. Most of the surface is concave incisocervically. The lingual ridge divides the surface into  two planes. The ridge b lends smoothly with the cingulum, which is sm all and confined to the cervical portion of the tooth. 4.23.3. Incisal Edge. Viewed on end, the incisal edge form s two curves that meet at the tip of the cusp. The mesial portion of the f acial outline is convex, but the dist al portion is slightly flattened. The mesial curve follows the alignment of the facial surf aces of the anterior  teeth. The distal part of the facial outline con forms to the buccal su rface alignment of posterior teeth.  The cingu lum appears uniformly curved on both sides. 4.23.4.  Mesial  Surface. The m esial surface m ore nearly resem bles the inciso rs than the m esial surface of the m axillary canine in  outline. Th e f acial outline is convex. The ling ual outlin e is chiefly concave except near the cervical margin. The mesial surface is generally convex. 4.23.5. Distal Surface. The distal s urface is shorter than the mesial surface, but ab out the sam e width. The incisal portion is very convex both faciolingually and inciso gingivally. The cervical portion is concave incisogingivally. 4.24. Mandibular First Premolar. The mandibular first premolar (Figure 4.46) is the fourth tooth from the median line in the mandibular arch. It is the smallest and least typical of the premolars.  Figure 4.46. Mandibular First Premolar.  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  151 4.24.1.  Facial  Surface. The facial surface is shaped som ewhat like a bell becau se the cervical portion is markedly con stricted in c omparison with  the occlusal portion. The distal cusp ridge of the occlusal border is slightly longer than the mesial cusp ridge, and the distoincisal angle is more rounded than the m esioincisal angle. The distal  portion of the surface is slightly shorter and broader than the mesial surface. The surface is convex. 4.24.2. Lingual Surface. The lingual surface is much s maller than the facial surface because the lingual cusp is sm aller than the f acial cusp. The tip of the lingual cusp is closer to the m esial margin than to the distal margin. The surface is convex. 4.24.3. Occlusal Surface. The occlusal surface is m arked by  a strong facial cu sp and a lingual  cusp that may appear almost rudimentary. The marginal ridges are well defined. The strong lingual ridge of the facial cusp and the facial ridge of  the lingual cusp m ay join, for ming a transverse  ridge. In this instance, the central groove would be very faint. 4.24.4.  Mesial  Surface. The m esial surface is irregular in  outline. Fro m this aspe ct, the tooth  appears to be tipped lingually. The outline is very convex, and the greatest conv exity is in th e cervical th ird. The lingu al outline is  fairly straig ht. Occluso cervically, the m esial su rface is very convex in the occlusal portion and concave in the cervical portion. 4.24.5. Distal Surface.

The mandibular second prem olar (Figure 4.47) is the fifth tooth from the median line in the mandibular arch.  Figure 4.47. Mandibular Second Premolar.  4.25.1. Facial Surface. The facial s urface is very sim ilar to the surface of the m andibular first premolar. The facial ridge is prominent, and the surface is convex. 4.25.2.  Lingual  Surface. The lin gual surf ace is sim ilar to  the su rface of  the m andibular f irst premolar except there may be two cusps--the mesiolingual and the distolingual. 4.25.3.  Occlusal  Surface. The occlusal surface m ay appear in  a num ber of form s. In the form pictured, the m esial and distal tr iangular fossae are quite distinct  as they join the short central groove. There are three pits; central, mesial, and distal. 4.25.4.  Mesial  Surface. The m esial surface is  sim ilar to th e surface of the m andibular first premolar, but it is more regular in outline. The surface is convex faciolingually. Occlusocervically, the occlusal portion is convex, and the cervical portion is concave. 4.25.5. Distal Surface. The distal surface is very similar to the mesial surface. 152  4.26. Mandibular First Molar. The m andibular first m olar (Figure  4.48) is the sixth tooth from the median line in the mandibular arch. It is also the largest tooth in the mandibular arch. The maxillary and mandibular first molars are often called 6-year molars.  Figure 4.48. Mandibular First Molar. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  4.26.1. Facial Surface. The facial surface presents three cusps; mesiofacial, distofacial, and distal. The mesiofacial cusp is the larges t; the distal is the sm allest. The distofacial cusp, though s maller than the mesiofacial cusp, may be slightly higher. The mesiofacial (facial) groove, which may end in a pit, separates the m esiofacial and distofacial cusps. The distofacial groove separates the distofacial and distal cusps. The facial surface is convex except at the grooves. 4.26.2.  Lingual  Surface. The ling ual su rface has a m esiolingual cusp  and a disto lingual cusp , which are similar in outline. They are separated by the sharply defined lingual groove. The surface is slightly convex. 4.26.3. Occlusal Surface. The occlusal surface of this tooth,  unlike the surface of the m axillary first molar, is f ormed by all f ive cusps and is tr apezoidal in shape. Th ere are three pits; m esial, central, and distal. A central gr oove, which connects these pits, div ides the occlusal surface into the lingual and facial h alves. From the occlu sal aspect, the m esiofacial cusp appears the larges t and the distal cusp appears the smallest. 4.26.4.  Mesial  Surface. The m esial surface is wider in  th e  cervical p ortion than  it is in  the occlusal portion because the occlusal and middl outline slope outward occlusocervically. The lingual outline is quite straight and nearly perpendicular. 4.26.5. Distal Surface. The distal surface is more symmetrical than the mesial surface because the facial outline is more nearly perpendicular than it is on the mesial surface. e th irds of the facial4.27. Mandibular Second Molar. The mandibular second molar (Figure 4.49) is the seventh tooth from the median line in the mandibular arch. It is one of the 12-year molars. 4.27.1. Facial Surface. The facial s urface is almost symmetr ical in outlin e, and th e mesiofacial and distofacial cusps ap pear nearly equal in s ize. The two cusps are separated by the deep fac ial groove. There is no third cusp. 4.27.2. Lingual Surface. The lingual surface is symm etrical, but the mesiolingual cusp is slightly longer and bulkier than the disto lingual cusp. The lingual groove is  shorter and less distinct than the groove on the facial surface. 4.27.3.  Occlusal  Surface. The occlusal su rface is rectang ular in sh ape. From  t his view, the mesiofacial cusp appears sligh tly larger than the other three cusps. The occlusal su rface has three pits; mesial, central, and distal. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 4.49. Mandibular Second Molar. 153   4.27.4. Mesial Surface. The m esial surface res embles the m esial surface of the mandibular first molar, but it is shorter. The f acial outline is convex occlusocervically. The occlusal portion of the lingual outline is convex, and the cervical portion is more nearly straight. 4.27.5. Distal Surface. The distal surface resembles the mesial surface. 154  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 OCCLUSION PATTERNS ASSOCIATED WITH BASIC MANDIBULAR POSITIONS AND Chapter 5 MOVEMENTS   Section 5A—Basic Terminology 5.1. Overview: 5.1.1.  Occlusion  is defined as the “the static relationship between the incising or masticating surfaces of the maxillary or mandibular teeth.” Articulation is defined as “the contact relationship between the occlusal surfaces of the teeth during function.” 5.1.2. Many patterns of tooth contactmandibular condyle’s substantial range of m ovement within the tem poromandibular joint. Som e of the m ore vital term s and fundam ental occlusion patterns associated with the basic m andibular positions and movements are described in this chapter.  are possible. Part of the reason for the variety is the 5.2.  Maximum  Intercuspation  (MI).  Maximum  intercuspation is the com plete intercuspation of  the opposing teeth independent of condylar position. 5.2.1. It is im portant to understand the value of MI  in the natural dentition. The MI position is a highly reproducible guide for restoring the shape of  badly broken down natural teeth. It is also a guide for aligning and shaping artificial teeth for partially edentulous arches. 5.2.2. A dentist checks the height of all kinds of restorations by asking the patient to bring opposing teeth into MI. A technician  routinely makes restorations on casts that have been related to each other in MI. W hen a natural dentition has gr ossly deteriorated or when all teeth have been extracted, one of the best m eans a dentist had  for accurate, reproducible positioning of the lower jaw in relation to the upper is gone. 5.2.3. Restorative challenges, like m aking com plete  dentures or rehabilitating an entire natural dentition, require the dentist to m ake an educated  guess. He or she m ust determine just where the lower jaw was located when the natural teeth cont acted in correct MI. The problem  is two-fold; properly orientating the lower jaw vertically and properly positioning the lower jaw horizontally. 5.3.  Centric  Relation.  Centric  relation is a m axillomandibular relationship in which the condyles articulate with their respective discs in the anteri or-superior position of the glenoid fossa against the articular eminences. 5.3.1. For m ost people, when their teeth are in  MI, the condyles are situated 1.25 m m plus or minus 1 mm forward of centric relation. W hen surfaces of teeth are grossly deteriorated or when all teeth are lost, there is no way of telling  exactly where the norm al MI position placed the condyles in the glenoid fossae. In these cases, the dentist uses the highly reproducible centric relation position to horizontally orient the lower jaw for prosthesis construction procedures. 5.3.2. How do we rationalize the probability that the  condyles were not in centric relation when the patient had a full com plement of sound natural teeth in good MI?  Fortunately for dentistry, most patients f unction well when the centric rela tion position is used to horizontally orient the lower jaw to the upper. For exam ple, denture teet h are purposely assem bled to com e together in MI when the condyles are in centric relation. The dental laboratory technician’s ability to fabricate any restoration or prosthesis in centric relation  requires an accurate jaw relation record in centric relation. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  5.4.  Centric  Occlusion.  Centric occlusion is the occlusion of relation (Figure 5.1). This position may or may not coincide with MI.  Figure 5.1. Centric Occlusion. 155 teeth when the m andible is in centric  5.5.  Vertical  and  Horizontal  Overlap.

Angle (1899) developed a cla ssification of the norm al and abnormal relationships of m axillary to m andibular teeth (Figur e 5.3). Angle defined three classes; I, II, and III. These classes are based on a person’s profile, the position of the m esiobuccal cusp of the upper first molar relative to the buccal developm ental groove of  the lower first m olar, and the upper anterior to lower anterior tooth relations in terms of vertical and horizontal overlap. 156  Figure 5.3. Angle’s Classification. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  5.6.1. Class I. In this class, the patient’s profile is characterized as norm al. The mesiobuccal cusp of the upper first molar falls in the buccal groove of the lower first molar when the teeth are in MI. In the anterior area, the norm al range of horizontal overlap is 0 to 2 m m and the average range of vertical overlap is 1 to 5 mm. 5.6.2. Class II. In this class, the patient’s prof ile is deficient in chin length and characterized as a retruded (retrognathic) profile. The m esiobuccal cusp of the upper first m olar falls anterior to the buccal groove of the lower first m olar in MI. In th e anterior area, horizontal overlaps in excess of 10 mm are not uncom mon. Vertical overlaps, where th e lower incisors m ake indentations in the gingiva of the palate, happen occasionally. In a ny event, the m ost significant feature about the anterior tooth relationships in Angle’s Class II is the m arked horizontal overlap. There are two subdivisions of Angle’s Class II as follows: 5.6.2.1. Class II, Division 1 (II/1). In Class II/1 m alocclusions, the m axillary incisors have a normal labiolingual inclination or are too labially inclined. 5.6.2.2. Class II, Division 2 (II/2). In Class II/2 malocclusions, two or more maxillary incisors are tipped palatally. 5.6.3. Class III. In this class, the patient’s prof ile is excessive in chin length and characterized as a protruded (prognathic) profile. The m esiobuccal cusp of the upper first m olar falls posterior to the buccal groove of the lower first molar in MI. In the anterior area, the upper and lower anteriors are usually edge to edge (0 mm of vertical  and horizontal overlap). Negative vertical and horizontal overlaps are possible. (The lingual surf aces of the lower anteriors are forward to and extend up over the incisal edges of the upper anteriors.)  Section 5B—Cusp Position in Maximum Intercuspation (MI) 5.7. Types of Cusps. From a functional point of view, there  are two types of cusps—stam p cusps and shearing cusps. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  157 5.7.1.  Stamp  Cusps  (Lingual  of  the  Upper  and  Buccal  of  the  Lower). Another nam e for a stamp cusp is  occlusal  vertical  dimension  holding  cusp. This is because stam p cusps act to maintain a constant distance between the upper and lower jaws when the teeth are in MI. 5.7.2. Shearing Cusps (Buccal of the Upper and Lingual of the Lower). By exclusion, shearing cusps are cusps other than stam p cusps. That is, shearing cusps do not m aintain the vertical distance between the upper and lower jaws when the teeth are in MI. 5.8.  Cusp  Relationships  With  Opposing  Teeth. W hen teeth com e into MI (Class I, II, or III), the stamp cusps in one arch hit in fossae or across occlusal embrasures of the teeth in the opposite arch. Two basic varieties of stamp cusp arrangements are used in making prosthodontic restorations; the cusp-to-occlusal embrasure pattern (paragraph 5.9) and the cusp-to-fossae pattern (paragraph 5.10). 5.9.  Cusp-to-Occlusal  Embrasure  Pattern. Variations of  this pattern are f requently seen in natural dentitions. This type of cusp placem ent was originally  established for com plete denture setups. It is basically a one tooth to two teeth relationship of a ll of the teeth except the m andibular central incisor and the last maxillary molar. In MI, most of the mandibular buccal cusps are in em brasure contact with the maxillary teeth, and alm ost all  of the m axillary lingual cusps are in a fossa relationship with the mandibular teeth. 5.9.1. Stamp Cusp Impacts: 5.9.1.1. Look at Figure 5.4 as you read the inform ation in Table 5.1 on contact locations of mandibular buccal cusps on maxillary teeth in a cusp-embrasure occlusion. You can see that all of the m andibular buccal cusps are in an em brasure contact relationship with the m axillary teeth, except the distobuccal (DB) cusps of the m andibular first and second m olars and the distal (D) cusp of the mandibular first molar.  Figure 5.4. Cusp-to-Embrasure Tooth Orientations (Mandibular Buccal).   5.9.1.2. Look at Figure 5.5 as you read the inform ation in Table 5.2 on contact locations on mandibular teeth by the m axillary lingual cusps in a cusp-em brasure occlusion. All of the maxillary lingual cusps are in a fossa relationship except the distolingual (DL) cusps of the maxillary first and second molars. 158  Table 5.1.

All of the m andibular lingual cusp tips are  in a lingual embrasure relationship with the upper teeth. (Exceptions are the distolingual cusp  of the mandibular first molar situated in the lingual developm ental groove of the m axillary fi rst m olar and the distolingual cusp of the mandibular second molar in the lingual developmental groove of the maxillary second molar. 5.10. Cusp-to-Fossa Pattern: 5.10.1.  Placement.  This type of cusp placem ent locates  all m andibular buccal cusps into the fossae of their m axillary counterparts. Also,  all m axillary lingual cusps are positioned in the fossae of their m andibular antagonists. Under ideal  conditions, it is a tooth-to-tooth relationship; that is, each m andibular posterior tooth cont acts one m axillary opponent. Although the cusp-to-fossa pattern is extensively used to restore teeth in fixed prosthetic dentistry, it is rarely seen in the natural dentition. 5.10.2. Three Advantages. A cusp-to-fossa relationship has th ree significant advantages over a cusp to em brasure relationship. First, it better Second, is it helps stabilize individual teeth in thFinally, a cusp-to-fossa relationship reduces food impaction in the proximal area because there are no cusp tips striking in the embrasures to force the teeth apart. 5.10.3.

Look at Figure 5.6 as you read the information in Table 5.3 on contact locations in the maxillary fossae by the mandibular buccal cusps in a cusp-fossa occlusion.   Figure 5.6. Cusp-to-Fossa Tooth Orientations (Mandibular Buccal).   5.10.3.2. Look at Figure 5.7 as you read the information in Table 5.4 on contact locations in the mandibular fossae by the maxillary lingual cusps in a cusp-fossa occlusion. 5.10.4. Shearing Cusp Positions: 5.10.4.1. The maxillary molar buccal cusps are lo cated over mandibular buccal developmental grooves. Maxillary prem olar buccal cusps are s ituated over specially form ed notches in the distal cusp ridges of m andibular premolar buccal cusps. NOTE: Notches are also placed in the mesial cusp ridges of maxillary premolar buccal cusps. 160  Table 5.3. Contact Locations of Mandibular Buccal Cusps on Maxillary Fossae.

The buccally located m axillary and m andibular notches reduce the possibility of lateral m ovement interference during working excursions. Natural teeth do not show such notching. 5.10.4.3.

W ithin limits, this m eans stamp cusps can intentionally be waxed into  of MI is frequently incorporated into 161 AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  tter lateral excursion clearance. Mandibular on with m axillary stam p cusps in working fossae and cusp arm s can be notched for beshearing cusps are positioned to avoid collisiexcursions. 5.10.4.4. In MI, the distolingual cusp of the m andibular first m olar is situated in the lingual developmental groove of the m axillary first m olar. The distolingual cusp of the m andibular second m olar is in the lingual developm ental  groove of the m axillary second m olar. The positions of the other m andibular shearing cusps  are somewhat more variable. Therefore, the mandibular lingual cusp position has to conform  to the working excursion rule (no opposing cusp collisions). Notching m axillary and m andibular cusp arm s on the lingual aspect of posterior teeth is just as acceptable as it was on the buccal. 5.11. Applying the Cusp-Fossa Philosophy to Prosthesis Fabrication: 5.11.1. Cusp-fossa contacts are of prim ary value in restoration problems that directly or indirectly involve natural teeth; for exam ple, single castings, fixed partial dentures,  RPDs, and natural teeth opposing a com plete denture. (The idea is to re produce cusp-fossa contacts if they were there originally.) 5.11.2. It m ay be possible to change cusp-em brasure contacts to the m ore desirable cusp-fossa variety by appropriately carving wax patterns. Ther e are no particular advantages to developing cusp-fossa contacts for opposing complete dentures. 5.12. Crossbite: axillary lingual cusps are the 5.12.1. Norm ally, the buccal cusps of the lower teeth and the mocclusal vertical dim ension holding (stam p) cusp s. In MI, the buccal cusps of the m axillary posteriors horizontally overlap the buccal cusps  of the m andibular teeth, and horizontal overlaps in the anterior area are the rule. 5.12.2. A crossbite exists when either or both of MI. The norm al stam p cusp and shearing cusp relationship found in related cases are reversed and/or the norm al horizontal and vertical ove rlap relationship found between upper and lower anterior teeth are reversed. 5.12.3. A crossbite can occur between a single  upper and the opposing lower tooth, a few upper and the opposing lower teeth, or throughout the dentition. the following tooth relationships are present in  Section 5C—Mandibular Movements 5.13. Vertical Dimension. Vertical dimension is any m easurement of vertical distance m ade between the upper and lower jaw. A m andible can travel  and stop anywhere on a path between m aximum opening and closure. If a vertical m easurement is to have m eaning, it should identify a place along the potential path of travel the dentist and the patient can find on dem and. The term vertical dimension with no further description of conditions is meaningless.  5.14.  Occlusal  Vertical  Dimension. Occlusal vertical dim ension is the vertical distance between the upper and lower jaws when natural teeth or denture t eeth are in MI. The presen ce of teeth (natural or artificial) controls how far the mandible can travel vertically toward the upper jaw. When teeth are badly worn or gone, “stops” at the correct occlusal vertical dimension do not exist. A reliable guideline is needed to estim ate where the vertical m ovement of the m andible toward the upper jaw should stop so the dental restorations can be made accordingly. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 162  5.15.  Physiologic  Rest  Position. A physiologic rest position is a m easurement of vertical dim ension made between the jaws when the m uscles controlling the m andible are relaxed. The occlusal vertical dimension in m ost people with a natural dentition is 2 to 4 m m less than the physiologic rest measurement. This 2 to 4 m m allows the patient to  have the teeth apart and out of function when relaxed. 5.16.  Estimates  of  the  Occlusal  Vertical  Dimension.  The principle behind speech sound (phonetic) occlusal vertical dim ension estim ates is sim ple. In a norm al natural dentition, teeth barely m iss contacting when “s” and “ch” sounds are spoken. The vertical dimension a person uses to form  these sounds stays about the sam e throughout adulthood, even  though the dental arches m ight show severe wear or com plete tooth loss.  NOTE: The physiologic rest position and phonetic occlusal vertical dimension estimate are two reproducible positions on the  mandible’s vertical path of travel frequently used by dentists to estimate what the correct occlusal vertical dimension might have originally been. 5.17. Errors in the Occlusal Vertical Dimension: 5.17.1. Open Occlusal Vertical Dimension: ing held too far apart when natural or 5.17.1.1. The patient’s upper and lower jaws are beartificial teeth m eet in MI. Fixed prostheses (s uch as single crowns, m ultiple crowns, or f ixed partial dentures) can be responsible for this problemimproperly m ade rem ovable prostheses could cau se an open occlusal vertical dim ension in people with few or no teeth. 5.17.1.2. An open occlusal vertical dim ension us ually results from  m aking an inaccurate occlusal vertical dim ension estim ate or from  an  error in the construction of the prosthesis. Some of the m ore common symptoms associated with an open occlusal vertical dim ension are soreness of the m uscles of m astication, inability to pronounce “s” and “ch” clearly, and teeth making contact noises while the person is talking.  when natural teeth are present. An 5.17.2. Closed Occlusal Vertical Dimension: icial teeth hit in MI. Possible generalized reasons f dimension, the patient’s jaws are too close 5.17.2.1. In the case of a closed occlusal verticalor such together when natural or artifoverclosure are as follows: severe wear of natural or artificial chewing surfaces, m arked resorption of the residual ridges in a person who  has been wearing the sam e set of  complete dentures for years, an erroneous estim ate of  the correct occlusal vertical dim ension during prosthesis construction procedures, or a technical error. 5.17.2.2. Som e clues that the occlusal vertical di mension is closed too far are as follows: reduced biting power, excessive space between the t eeth when the patient is in physiologic rest position, or a great deal of space visible betw een upper and lower teeth while “s” sounds are spoken. (Teeth should barely miss.) 5.18. Types of Mandibular Movements: 5.18.1. The mandible is capable of many different, subtle kinds of movements. When the mandible moves, the condyles m ost certainly m ove with  it, but the type and direction of condylar movements are not necessarily the same in each joint. 5.18.2. Basic m andibular m ovements consist of  hinge  (paragraph 5.19),  translatory  (paragraph 5.20), and lateral movements (paragraph 5.21). Most of the tim e a typical m andibular movement is a smooth, fluid blend of two or three of these motions. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  5.19. Hinge Movements. Hinge movements consist of either opening or closing motions on a horizontal axis common to both condyles (Figure 5.8).  Figure 5.8. Rotational Movement Around a Hinged Axis. 163  5.20. Protrusion or Retrusion (Translatory) Movements. 5.20.1. These m ovements are called translatory (sliding) m ovements although, in protrusion, incisal guidance causes hinge m ovement to occur  at the sam e time. In protrusion, both condyles leave their fossae and m ove forward upon the artic ular eminences. When the m andible retrudes, both condyles leave the eminences and move back into their respective fossae.  5.20.2. The full envelope of hinge and translatory m ovements as viewed in the m idsagittal plane appears in Figure 5.9.

Path 5b--most protruded path of opening the mandible is capable of taking.  NOTE: Although Paths 2ab, 1cb, and 5b in Figure 5.9 are desc ribed as “opening” paths, they are also “closing” paths.  Figure 5.9. Anteroposterior and Vertical Movements.  5.21. Right and Left Lateral Movements. The side to which the mandible moves is called the working side; the side opposite the working side is called the  nonworking side. The condyle on the working side is called the working or rotating condyle. By ex clusion, the other condyle becom es the nonworking or orbiting condyle. A general description of lateral mandibular motion (Figure 5.10) is as follows: 5.21.1. As the mandible moves to the side, the cusp s and incisal edges of the opposing teeth m ust clear one another. Also, the em inence on the nonworking side is probably lower than the fossa on the working side. The conclusion is that the m andible opens, at least slightly, to m ake a lateral movement. 5.21.2. The working side condyle rotates in its fossa (Figure 5.10-A). translates forward and m edially down its 5.21.3. The nonworking (or balancing) side condyle eminence and produces a protrusion of the nonworking side. Because the nonworking condyle follows a limited arc of travel around the worki ng condyle, the nonworking condyle is said to be orbiting the working condyle (Figure 5.10-B). 5.21.4. There is a total shift (or  mandibular translation [MT]) or sideshift of  the mandible and its condyles toward the working side (Figure 5.10-C). Two fundam ental kinds  of MT, progressive and immediate, can occur. 5.21.4.1. Progressive MT is characterized as the working condyle rotating and moving laterally while the balancing condyle moves forward and medially, all as a single integrated movement.  5.21.4.2. Immediate MT takes place prior to the working condyle’s rotation or the balancing condyle’s translation. It occurs immediately prior to the occurrence of progressive MT once the lateral excursion begins. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  165 5.21.4.3. MT of the m andible takes different direc tions of travel from  person to person (and sometimes from right to left sides in the same person). 5.21.5. The  Bennett angle (lateral condylar inclination) is  the angle the orbiting condyle m akes when a sagittal plane passes through its fossa, as path’s angle to the sagittal plane averages 12 to  15 degrees. This angle is the com bined result of  the balancing (nonworking) condyle advancing medially, plus any sideshift that takes place.  viewed in the horizontal plane. The orbiting  Figure 5.10. Typical Lateral Movement.  5.22. Arrow Point or Gothic Arch: 5.22.1. When test lateral m ovements are made with the casts of a patient’s m outh mounted in an articulator (a device that simulates mandibular motion), the maxillary and mandibular stamp cusps move out of MI and follow predictable routes across opposing chewing surfaces. 5.22.2. The incisal edges of lower anterior teeth al so travel well-defined paths as they pass over the lingual surfaces of upper anterior teeth. The in tersection of a stam p cusp’s working excursion and its nonworking excursion produces a Gothic ar ch or arrow point. The MI position is at the apex. 5.22.3. Stam p cusp routes are diagram med in  Figure 5.11. The arrow points generated by maxillary stamp cusps crossing m andibular chewing surfaces are directed  forward. Arrow points generated by m andibular stamp cusps and incisal  edges on m axillary tooth surfaces are directed backward. 5.22.4. When the arrow point patterns in the m ouths of a num ber of patients are analyzed, the findings indicates the angle inside  an arrow point changes from  tooth to tooth and from  person to person. 5.22.5. What are some of the m ajor factors that aff ect the size of the included angle?  The farther away a tooth is located from  the condyles, the gr eater the angle within the arrow point. As the distance between the condyles increases, the Gothic  arch angle decreases (and vice versa). As the amount of mandibular translation increases, an arrow point’s included angle gets larger.  5.22.6. Persons having m ostly progressive MT have  working and nonworking paths that intersect at a precise point. Persons having im mediate MT show com parative blunting or rounding at the intersection of the working and nonworking paths.  166  Figure 5.11. Stamp Cusp Arrow Point Tracings.

This information emphasizes that every stamp cusp has a specific working and nonworking track for leaving the MI position, the tracks proceed in directions unique to each cusp, and no obstruction (interference) to a stamp cusp’s lateral movement should appear along those tracks. 5.22.8. When chewing surfaces are fabricated for a pr osthesis on an articulator, the alignm ent of occlusal ridges and grooves will be dictated by the lateral movements of stamp cusps in and out of MI (Gothic arch tracks). If the ridge and grooveconflict with the patient’s true lateral munanticipated, harmful cusp collisions could po ssibly occur. The following questions should be answered to develop properly aligned ridges and grooves for the chewing surfaces of a prosthesis: ovements af ter the prosthesis is delivered, then  alignm ents, as developed in the articulator 5.22.8.1. How closely does the articulator simulate the patient’s actual MT? 5.22.8.2. Is the m axillary cast positioned (articulat ed) on the articulator the sam e way the maxilla relates to the glenoid fossae? 5.22.8.3. Does the articulator’s intercondylar distance match the patient’s distance? 5.23.  Occlusal  Disharmony. The disastrous effect of occluscomparing the temporomandibular joint and mandibular movement with the lever systems. al disharm ony is best explained by 5.23.1.  Classes  of  Lever  Systems. Each lever system  consists of a rigid bar in contact with a fulcrum, one point on the bar for the application of force and another point on the bar for the application of a load. There are three classes of lever systems; Class I, II, and III as follows: 5.23.1.1. Class I Lever System. As shown in Figure 5.12, a Class I lever system  consists of a rigid bar across a fulcrum . Force applied to one  end of the bar m oves a load on the other end (like pliers or a crowbar). This is a very effi cient system because the working force transmitted to the load can be multiplied simply by moving the fulcrum closer to the load and further away from the point of applied force. 5.23.1.2. Class II Lever System. A Class II lever system consists of a rigid bar with a fulcrum  at one end, a load in the m iddle, and a force applied to the other end. A wheelbarrow is an example of a Class II lever system  (Figure 5.12). Th is system is less efficient than the Class I lever system because the load is shared between the fulcrum and the applied force. 5.23.1.3.  Class  III  Lever  System. A Class III lever system  consists of a rigid bar with a fulcrum placed at one end, a load applied to th e other end, and working force applied in the middle like a tree pruner or drawbridge (Figure 5.12). The normal mandibular jaw is a Class III lever system in both the anteroposterior and cross- arch directions. This system  is less efficient than either the Class I or II systems because more force must be applied to do the same amount of work.  168  Figure 5.12. Lever Systems. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  5.23.2. Nondestructive Lever System (Figure 5.13): 5.23.2.1. When people chew on the right or left side  or bite with their anterior teeth, a Class III lever system normally develops (Figure 5.13-A). In this system, the teeth closest to the point of applied force receive the greatest impact. The teeth farther away from the point of applied force receive a progressively lesser am ount of force.  This explains why people tend to lose their anterior teeth last, even though  the teeth are comparatively weak by structural design. Because the anterior teeth feel decreased muscular force, they receive less stress. 5.23.2.2. The posterior teeth (Figure  5.13-B) are close to the point of applied force in both the anteroposterior and cross-arch directions. Consequently, they transfer more of the applied force to the load and are under m ore functional stress th an the anterior teeth. They are well able to support the added stress because the large surface area of their multiple root structure stabilizes them and transfers the functional stresses more evenly to the alveolar ridges.  Figure 5.13. Nondestructive Lever System.  5.23.3.  Destructive  Lever  System  (Figure  5.14). Faulty occlusal contacts can change the nondestructive Class III lever system  to a destructive Class I or II lever system  by changing the relationship of the fulcrum and working points as follows: 5.23.3.1. Class III to Class I Lever System. If a posterior nonworking contact occurs during the protrusive biting function, the fulcrum  point moves from the tem poromandibular joint to AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  169 e closing m uscle force vector (P) is now the point of faulty contact (Figure 5.14-A). Thposterior to the tooth fulcrum  (F). The work (W ) is still done in the area of the anterior teeth. This condition is particularly harmful because it results in incisal stress not in line with the long axis of the working (anterior teeth). 5.23.3.2. Class III to Class II Lever System. If a high-lateral nonworking contact occurs when the m andible is m oved to the side to chew food, the norm al Class III lever system  will be changed to the Class II lever system (Figure 5.14-B). In this instance the work (W) is still being done on the working side, but the prem ature nonworking contact (B) triggers a m ore forceful closure of the m uscles (P) on the nonworking si de. This changes the norm al Class III lever system to the destructive Class II lever system and puts an unusual am ount of stress on the teeth with the undesired contact.  Figure 5.14. Destructive Lever System.  Section 5D—Functional Articulations 5.24. Lateral and Translating Excursions: 5.24.1. Angle’s classification deals with three basic ways that teeth com e into MI. However, there are at least seven ways that natural or artificial teeth actually f unction in lateral and translating excursions. Four of the functional articulation natural teeth. Technicians intentionally organize the other three patterns when they construct complete dentures (see Chapter 7).  5.24.2. There are very distinctive characteristics that set the functional articulation schem es apart from one another. The individual patterns of artic ulation are based on contact differences between upper and lower teeth during working, nonworking, and protrusive excursions.

All other features of anterior-guided articulation are unchanged. ake contact. 5.27.  Delayed  Anterior-Guided  Articulation. This form  of articulation shows group function and anterior guided articulation in the same working movement. 5.27.1. Anterior Teeth. In MI, anterior teeth have a horizontal overlap of 1 to 2 mm and a vertical overlap of 2 m m or m ore. (Delayed anterior-guided articulation has the horizontal overlap characteristic of group function and vertical overlap associated with anterior-guided articulation.) 5.27.2. Working Side. The working m ovement begins with  the opposing posterior teeth on one side sliding across one another in group function. Th e last part of the m ovement shows anterior guided articulation. That is, sufficient contact deve lops between upper and lower anterior teeth to cause separation of opposing posteriors. 5.27.3. Nonworking Side. There is no contact between upper and lower teeth. 5.27.4. Protrusive. There is edge-to-edge contact between  upper and lower anteriors. There is no posterior tooth contact. 5.28.

In MI, the anterior teeth have a horizontal overlap of 0.0 to 0.5 mm on the anterior guided side and 1 to  2 mm of horizontal overlap on the group function side. The anterior teeth in MI have a vertical overlap of 2 m m or  more on the anterior-guided side and a vertical overlap of 1 to 2 mm on the group function side. 5.28.2.  Working  Sides.

Nonworking contacts involving natural teeth routinely cause pain in the interfdestruction of a tooth’s bone support. ering teeth and the tem poromandibular joint. These contacts also cause 5.29.  Christensen’s  Phenomenon.  Christensen’s phenom enon is the space that occurs between opposing occlusal surfaces during mandibular prot rusion (Figure 5.15). The anterior teeth are responsible for the disclusion of the posterior teeth during the protrusive movement.  Figure 5.15. Christensen’s Phenomenon.  5.30.  Major  Determinants  of  Articulation. Major determ inants of  articulation include the occlusal plane, occlusal curve, condylar angle or direction, and incisal guide angle, as follows: 5.30.1. Occlusal Plane. The occlusal surfaces of the prem olars and molars of both the upper and lower jaws in opposition establish the occlusal plane (Figure 5.16).  Figure 5.16. Occlusal Plane.  172  5.30.2. Occlusal Curve. The occlusal curve consists of the following two parts: AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 5.30.2.1. Anteroposterior Curve. The anteroposterior curve is the anatom ic curve established by the occlusal alignm ent of the teeth (fro m the canine through the buccal cusps of the posterior teeth), when viewed from the side. It also is called the Curve of Spee (Figure 5.17). 5.30.2.2. Curve of Wilson. The Curve of Wilson is the lateral component of the occlusal curve when viewed from the anterior (Figure 5.17).  Figure 5.17. Occlusal Curve.   5.30.3. Condylar Angle of Direction. The angle or direction of the condyle as it traverses the contours of the glenoid fossa dictates the cusp height of teeth. A steep eminence inclination would permit longer cusps; a shallow eminence inclination would require shorter cusps. 5.30.4. Incisal Guide Angle. The incisal guide angle of an articulator is determined by the amount of horizontal and vertical overlap the anterior teet h exhibit. As the overlap increases, the length of the cusp may be longer. Consequently, as the overlap decreases, the cusp length  must be shorter. The condylar inclination and anterior guidance  may be dependent on each other. The anterior guidance in a healthy occlusion is approxim ately 5 to 10 degrees steeper than the condylar inclination, which allows for separation of the pos terior teeth during a protrusive m ovement. (See Christensen’s Phenomenon in paragraph 5.29.)  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  173 Chapter 6   ARTICULATORS AND ARTICULATOR SIMULATION OF HUMAN ANATOMICAL CHARACTERISTICS Section 6A—Types of Articulators 6.1. Overview. An  articulator is a m echanical instrument that rep resents the tem poromandibular joint and jaws, to  which the m axillary and mandibular cast may be atta ched to sim ulate all or som e of the mandibular movements. Articulators simulate the positions and movements of the patient’s lower jaw in relation to the upper jaw so a prosthesis with pr oper occlusion can be m ade. The accuracy  of the simulation depends on the accuracy of the dentist’s transfer records and the degree of adjustability of the instrument. 6.2. Transfer Records. The following records, detailed in Section 6B are important to the process: 6.2.1. The vertical and horizontal orientation of the upper jaw to both temporomandibular joints. 6.2.2. The patient’s actual centric relation, or the dentist’s estim ate of where centric relation should occur. 6.2.3. The angles that the articulator eminences form with the occlusal plane. 6.2.4. The tem poromandibular joint characterislaterotrusion. 6.2.5. The distance between the patient’s condyles (intercondylar distance). 6.2.6. Relative presence or absence of anterior guidance. tics governing the tim ing and direction of 6.3. Articulator Categories: 6.3.1. There are many different kinds of articulators. The primary difference among them is in the number of controls or adjustments they possess. 6.3.2. Articulators having a full range of adjustm ents can be set to m atch the patient’s guiding anatomical features. As  a result, articulator  movements c ome very close to duplicating the patient’s ac tual jaw movem ents. Articu lators  with no a djustments are built tostatistically average m anner, canno t be set to m ove in any other way, and have a m uch more  limited application. 6.3.3. Based on the adjustability factor, articulators  fall into three broad  categories; nonadjustable (paragraph 6.4), semiadjustable (paragraph 6.5), and fully adjustable (paragraph 6.6). 6.3.4. Just because an articulator harticulator only becom es inferior w hen it is  taxed beyond its capabilitie s. On the other hand, a fancy, impressive articulator is still only a machine unless used to its fullest advantage. The dental laboratory technician should become intimately familiar with how all types of articulators work in order to develop the ability to m atch a job’s de mands to an articulator’s capabilities. Once an articulator is selected, the technician should not use the device beyond its mechanical limitations. as m inimal ad justability does not m ean it is inferior. An   m ove in a 6.4. Nonadjustable Articulators: 6.4.1. Hinge-Type Articulator. This variety is the sim plest made. It can m ake a basic opening and closing movement (Figure 6.1). It has no ability to go into lateral or protrusive excursions. 174  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 6.4.1.1. Som etimes these devices are called “holdi ng” instrum ents. Their only function is to hold or maintain the vertical and horizontal re lationships between two casts at one mandibula r position.  Figure 6.1. Hinge-Type Articulator.   6.4.1.2. Most of the time, hinge instruments are used to make very simple fixed and removable prostheses. The dentist fully expects to correct lateral and protrusive interferences in the mouth at the tim e the prosth esis is  inserted. Examples of these re placements would be a tem porary fixed partial denture or an interim RPD. 6.4.1.3. It is possible to m ake very complicated, “permanent” rest orations with a pure hinge instrument. For a hinge instrum ent to be used  this way, the dentist would have to use functionally generated path techniques to get adequate cast mountings for the job. 6.4.2.

Fixed-guide articulators are machined to produce the lateral and protrusive m ovements characteristic of a statisticalTherefore, if the “average” movements of the articulator match the actual movements of the patient, the patient is in luck. 6.4.2.2. These kinds of articulators  are used extensively, and the su ccess rate asso ciated with their use appears to b horizontal relationships between opposing casts is  their most dependable performance feature.

Fixed-Guide Articulator. 175  6.5. Semiadjustable Articulator: angle of a person’s articularclass can compensate for the 6.5.1. The semiadjustable articulator has enough adjustable features to give fair to good simulation of a patient’s actual mandibular movements.  6.5.2. Many articulators in this eminence, horizontal and vertical overlap conditions, and am ount of  progressive m andibular translation (sideshift). Some have fewer adjustments (no variable progressive sideshift), and some have m ore adjustm ents (imm ediate sideshift, pr ogressive sideshift, an d variable intercondylar distance). 6.5.3. These articulators are very ve rsatile and the m ost frequently  used in the Dental Services. They are used for making all forms of removable prostheses and for moderately complicated fixed prosthodontic restorations. Some dentists use the m ost adjustable of the articulators in this group for complete mouth fixed prosthodontic rehabilitations. 6.5.4. The types of semiadjustable articulators commonly used are the Hanau H2-158 (Figure 6.3), Hanau Wide-Vue (Figure 6.4) and the Whip-Mix (Figure 6.5). 6.5.5. There are two wa ys (methods) of using s emiadjustable articulators from the standpoint of making them match the patient’s anatomical features and resultant mandibular movement: 6.5.5.1. Arbitrary (or Average) Method. Only thos e patient factors that ar e most critical to the success of the case are reproduced on the articulator with the greatest accuracy possible (for example, centric relation, MI, and occlusal vertical dimension). Statistical averages are used to set all remaining articulator adjustments. The so-called “average” settings are supposed to hold true for the majority of the patient population. When a semiadjustable articulator is used in this way, it becomes a fixed guide instrument and has the same limitations. 6.5.5.2.  Semiadjustable  Method. The dentis t ar ticulates the patien t’s cas ts an d sets a ll articulator adjustm ents based on actual patient m easurements. Two kinds of measurem ent systems are used; facebow transfer and maxillomandibular relationship records, as follows:  176  Figure 6.3. Hanau H2-158 Semiadjustable Articulator. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 6.4. Hanau Wide-Vue Semiadjustable Articulator.  e axis-orb ital plan e. This tran6.5.5.2.1. Facebow Transfer. A facebow transfer is a procedure used to  attach a m axillary cast onto an articulator in the sam e way the maxilla relates to the temporomandibular joints. When the in fraorbital canal is used  as a thir d point of reference in  a facebow tran sfer, the maxillary c ast is also  r elated to  th e hor izontal plane  of  the ar ticulator like the  patien t’s maxilla relates to thmaxillomandibular r elationship r ecord, a llows the  opening axis  of  the  patien t to  be  transferred to the articulator. 6.5.5.2.2. Maxillomandibular Relationship Records. The articulator’s adjustments are set imensional m ethods of m easurement called   maxillomandibular according to three-drelationship  records. There a re two types of  m axillomandibular re lationship reco rds. The  first is a template tha t relates the lower cast against the upper cast in the s ame way the jaws relate when the record is made in the patient’s  mouth (for example, centric relation record). sfer, in com bination with a AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  177 After the casts are m ounted, the second kind o f m axillomandibular relationsh ip record is  used to set articulator adjustments (lateral and protrusive records).  Figure 6.5. Whip-Mix Semiadjustable Articulator.  6.6. Fully Adjustable Articulator: 6.6.1. This catego ry differs from  the sem iadjustable on e b ecause of features lik e custom -made condyle guides, highly variable intercondylar distance, very clos e simulation of  the tim ing and direction of laterotrusion, and a capacity to sim ulate the direction of th e rotating condyle (Figures 6.6 and 6.7). 6.6.2. The information needed to accomplish these highly refined adjustments does not come from maxillomandibular r elationship r ecords. It c omes f rom m andibular m ovement trac ings or recordings (pantographic traci ngs or stereographic recordings ) m ade by the patient under the direction of  the dentist. The articulator is then programm ed to confor m to the tracings or recordings. 6.6.3. Fully adjustable arti culators are used on the m ost  demanding kinds of cases; that is, detecting and treating patients whose jaw m ovement patterns are not norm al and completing full mouth fixed prosthodon tic restorations.  NOTE: A fully adjustable instrument can be used in the fixed-guide and semiadjustable modes if a less adjustable articulator is not available. 6.7. Arcon Versus Non-Arcon: 6.7.1. Some semiadjustable articulators and all fully  adjustable articulators are described as being arcon  in design. The w ord  arcon  is an acrony m for the words AR ticulator and  CON dyle. It describes those instruments having the condyle elem ents attached to  the articu lator’s lower  member in the same way condyles are an anatomic feature of the mandible in a human skull. 6.7.2. At the sam e time, the upper m ember of t he articulator carries m echanisms simulating the glenoid fossae of the m axilla. As examples, the Hanau H2-158, Hanau W ide-Vue, and Whip-Mix are semiadjustable articulators of the arcon variety. The Hanau 96H2 sem iadjustable articulator is non-arcon in design. Stuart®, Denar®, and TMJ instruments are fully adjustable articulators and, as such, are also arcon in design.  178  Figure 6.6. Fully Adjustable Articulator (With Pantographic Tracing). AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 6.7. Fully Adjustable Articulator (With Stereographic Recording).  6.7.3. What are the advantages of an  arcon articulator over non-arc on varieties? One advantage of the arcon articulator is that it is anatomically correct, making it is easier to understand m andibular movements. Another advantage of the arcon design is that the condylar incl ination is at a fixed angle relative to  the o cclusal p lane. W hen th e arcon designed articula tor is opened, the angle between the condylar inclination and the occlusal plane remains constant. 6.7.4. Perfect reproduction of m andibular m ovement has always been an elusive goal. Once programmed, the arcon articulator is capable opatient’s own movements.

Limitations Based on Design: 179 6.8.1. Nonadjustable Articulators. Nonadjustable articulators, li ke the ones in Figures 6.1 and 6.2, are small instrum ents that cannot effectiv ely reproduce m andibular m ovements due to the following design limitations: 6.8.1.1. The distance from  the teet h to the center of  rotation (axis), which passes through the condyles location, is consid erably shorter than in the skull. Consequently, the patient’s hinge axis is different than the articulators, causing a change in the arc of closure. 6.8.1.2. As the mandible moves up and down in the terminal hinge position, the cusp tip moves transverse  horizontal  axis  shown in along an arc with the center Figure 6.8 as the mandibular hinge axis (mha). If the distance between the transverse horizontal axis and the  cusp tip dif fers from the  patient to the articulator, the arc of closure would be  different (steeper or shallower), producing an error. of rotation located at the  Figure 6.8. Mandibular Hinge Axis (mha) Versus Articulator Hinge Axis (aha).   6.8.1.3. Drastic differences between the arc of closure on the articulator and the patient’s mouth may affect the placement of cusps, ridges, and g rooves on the occlusal surfaces. For exam ple, when casts are re lated using a thic k interoc clusal reco rd, the tee th occlude in a different intercuspal position on the  articulator than in the  patient’s mouth. This resu lts in an occlu sal interference between th e m esial inc lines of  th e  maxillary teeth and th e di stal inclines of  the  mandibular teeth. 6.8.1.4. If the casts are m ounted in MI, without an  interocclusal record, the arc of closure difference does not present a problem . The significance of “an arc of closure” depends on whether the occlusal vertical dim ension is being altered. Remember, nonadjustable articulators are de signed to hold  a nd reprodu ce accu rately only one  p osition. If a ny changes in occ lusal vertical dim ension are foreseen, it is  best to  graduate to  a s emiadjustable a rticulator with  appropriate facebow transfer and maxillomandibular relationship records. 6.8.1.5. The articulator’s design also effects the path ways of teeth as they travel in lateraexcursions. As the distance between the condyles  increases (intercondylar width), the Gothic arch angle decreases (and vice versa). This effect is even more evident when a small hinge-type articulator is used (Figure 6.9). On such sm all instruments, the discre pancy between the paths l 180  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 trument and in the m outh can be sizable, particularly on the traveled by  a cusp on the ins in creased pos sibility of inco rporating a balancing occlusal balancing side. The result is aninterference.  NOTE: There are nonadjustable articulators approxim ately th e sam e siz e as  semiadjustable articulators. Do not assum e  every “nonadjustable” instrum ent has the sam e design limitations as the ones previously mentioned.  Figure 6.9. Articulator Versus Mandible Gothic Arch Tracings.  6.8.2.  Semiadjustable  Articulator. A sem iadjustable ar ticulator is  an  instrum ent of  larger  siz e and more closely approximates the distance from the axis of rotation to  the teeth. W hen casts are articulated using a facebow transfer,  the arc of  closure produced on the articulator resem bles the arc in the patient’s mouth and any resulting error is slight (Figure 6.10). Placing the casts closer to or farther away from the condyles has only a small effect during lateral excursions (Figure 6.11).  Figure 6.10.

Mounting plates are used for fixation of the patient’s cast to the upper and lower m embers of the articulator. Mounting plates are keyed. The  cast and its mounting plate can be rem oved from the articulator during work and can be replaced in the identical position. 6.9.4.  Condylar  Shaft  (E). The condylar shaft is the articula tor equivalent of the opening and closing axis of rotation existing between the two condyles of the mandible. 6.9.5. Post (F). The post is the articulator equivalent of a ramus of the mandible. 6.9.6.  Horizontal  Condylar  Guidance  and  Lockscrew  (G  and  H). The condylar guidance contains a condylar slot that isthe glenoid fossa and articular eminence. By rotating the guid ance, the cond ylar  slot can be oriented at different angles. T he lockscrew holds the slot at a chosen angle. 6.9.7. Horizontal Condylar Indication (I). The horizontal condylar inclination contains a scale (- 20 degrees to + 60 degrees) showing the angle at horizontal plane. 6.9.8. Condylar Element (J). The condylar element, the ball that travels within the condylar slot, is the articulator equivalent of the condyle of the mandible. 6.9.9. Centric Stop (K).

Whip-Mix condyle elem ents can be ad justed to three interelem ent (intercondylar) distances; small (88 mm), medium (100 mm), and large (112 mm). 6.10.6. Horizontal Condylar Guide and Condylar Indication Scale (G and H). The condylar guide is the articulator equivalent  of the patient’s glenoid fossa  and articular eminence. The scale shows the angle at which the condylar guide is inclined to the horizontal plane. 6.10.7.  Condylar  Guide  Clamp  and  Lockscrew  (I). One  of the functions of the clam p and lockscrew is to maintain the condylar guide at selected inclinations. 6.10.8. Intercondylar Distance Spacers (J): 6.10.8.1. When the con dyle elements are adju sted to sm all, medium, or large settin gs, the condylar guides have to travel  in or out with them . The al ignment of the condylar guides over the condyle elements has to be very prec ise, and the intercondylar distance spacers are responsible for the alig nment. The spacers ar e placed on the shaft that holds the condylar guide suspended from the condylar guide cl amp. Although no spacer is placed  on the shaft for the small condyle element setting, one is used per side for the  medium condyle element position and two are used per side for the large setting.  6.10.8.2. Because th e intercondylar spacers are speci fic for the W hip Mix articu lator they are packaged for, they should not be interchanged or used with another W hip Mix articulator. When not in use, the sp acers should be placed o n the incisal guide pin to insure  they remain with that articulator. 6.10.9. Lateral Condylar (or Sideshift) Guide and Lockscrew (K and L). The sideshift guide and scale are the articulator’s  sideshift controls. A standard  Whip-Mix articulator (Model 8500)  comes equipped with sideshift guides that only allow adjustable progressive sideshift. Another Whip-Mix model, the 2000 series, com es with curv ilinear eminentia, a 7 1/ 2 degree progressive sideshift, and adjustable immediate sideshift guides. 6.10.10.  Incisal  (Anterior)  Guide  Pin  and  Lockscrew  (M  and  N). The incisal guide pin is a means of controlling the occlusal vertical dimension once casts are mounted. The occlusal vertical dimension can be held constant or changed if needed. 6.10.11.  Incisal  (Anterior)  Guide  Table  and  Lockscrew  (O  and  P). The incisal guide table helps preserve existing horizonta l and vertical overlaps between  upper and lower anterior teeth. The incisal guide table can also  help develop proper horizontal a nd vertical overlaps when these  tooth relationship factors are inadequate or absent. 6.10.12. Latch Assembly (Q). The latch assembly is a device that centers the upper m ember over the condy le elem ents in a cen tric position  when  immediate s ideshift guides are used. W ith the centric latch engaged, the upper member is secured to the lower member. 6.10.13.  Facebow  Mounting  Pin  (R).

Adequate simulation of  the ver tical and hor izontal o rientation of  the  m axilla de pends on how the  maxillary cast relates  to the condy lar elements of the articulator when the cast is mounted to th e upper member. Three methods may be used to es tablish the orientation of the maxillary cast to the articulator. They are the average method, the ar bitrary facebow transfer m ethod, and the kinem atic axis facebow  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  transfer method. The average m ethod is discussed in  paragraph 6.12 and the arbi trary facebow transfer method is d iscussed in  paragraph 6 .13. (The k inematic axis facebow m ethod resembles the arbitrary facebow method enough that it will not be discussed further.)  6.12. Average Method: 185 6.12.1. Hanau H2-158: 6.12.1.1. To mount a cast with this method, first place a rubber band around the condylar posts and the anterior guide pin (Figure 6.14). (Ensure the top of the guide pin is flush with the upper member.) Then position the band on the pin’s lo wer mark and m ake the band parallel to the articulator’s horizontal plane.  Figure 6.14. Average Mounting of a Maxillary Cast in a Hanau H2-158 Articulator.  6.12.1.2. Using com pound, sticky wax, or glue, secure th e m axillary and m andibular cast together in MI or with a centr ic relation record. Orient the occlusal plane of the m axillary cast, using clay or wax support to fall on the plan the m axillary cast  represents a complete denture case, make the plane of the maxillary occlusion rim conform to the plane of the rubber band.) 6.12.1.3.

Whip-Mix: 6.12.2.1. This articulator was never intended to be us ed as a fixed-guide instrum ent. It has no convenient reference marks for average mounting of an upper cast (anterior guide pin reference grooves).  6.12.2.2. However, to use the articulator in this way, m easure 40 mm  down the lower fram e from the under surface of a condyle ball and engrav e a discreet mark (Figure 6.15). Do this on the left and  righ t lower fram e uprights. Th en place a rub ber band around the two engraved  marks and around the anterior guide pin.   Figure 6.15. Notched Whip-Mix Upright.  6.12.2.3. The front part of the rubber band can now be  adjusted so the ba nd is parallel to the horizontal plane of the articulator (Figure 6.16). Once the rubber band is positioned, perform an average upper cast mounting as for the Hanau H2-158. 6.13. Arbitrary Facebow Transfer Method: 6.13.1. Mounting an upper cast for the sem iadjustable or fully adjustable m odes is done with a facebow transfer. A fac ebow is a caliper-like inst rument that relates an upper cast to the condyle elements of an articulator in the same way a patient’s upper jaw relates to the temporomandibular joints (Figure 6.17). 6.13.2. Mounting an up per cast in this way is much  more accurate th an using statistical averag es (Figure 6.18). One advantage is that sm all alterations can be m ade to the occlusal vertical dimension without remounting the case. A nother  advantage is that the lateral tooth contact relationships developed for a p rosthesis in the a rticulator are more lik ely to show up in th e same way when the patient moves the lower jaw laterally.  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 6.16.

AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  6.14. Centric Relation:  6.14.1. Once the upper cast is m ounted, the lower cast must be articulated against it. It is up to the dentist to d ecide whether maximum intercuspation is adequate for articulating the lower cast or whether the articulation must be done with some form of maxillomandibular relation record. 6.14.2. Every position the m andible can as sume in re lation to the m axilla has a ho rizontal and a vertical component. The horizontal com ponent represents the anteroposteri or and lateral position of the condyles in th e glenoid fossae. The vertical  component is the prevailing vertical dim ension between the maxilla and mandible (that is, the o cclusal vertical dimension or som e other ve rtical distance between the jaws). 6.14.3. When enough natural teeth remain, the casts might be mounted in MI. The way the teeth fit together controls the horizontal position of the  lower jaw in relation to  the upper, and the natural usal vertical dim ension. When  an acceptable  MI is gone, the teeth in contact produce an occlcentric re lation position  is used to horizon tally or ient the lower jaw, and the occlusal ve rtical dimension must be estimated. This situation is typical of complete denture problems. 6.14.4. The dentist records centric maxillomandibular relationship record (for example, record bases and record rims). The technician uses this record to articulate the lower cast against the upper cast. The use of a maxillomandibular relationship record to orient edentulous casts is described in Chapter 7, paragraph 7.48. For an example of a MI mounting with casts from dentulous patients, see Chapter 8, paragraph 8.40.2. 6.14.5. A complete m outh rehabilitation case requiring  multiple crowns or fi xed partial dentures involves the sam e kind of problem . W hen the dent ist is f inished prepar ing the natural teeth, maximum intercuspation is gone. The dentist must supply a maxillomandibular relationship record to mount the mandibular cast. (See Chapter 1, Volume 2, of this manual.) 6.14.6. After the lower cast is articu lated against the upper cast,  be acutely aware that changing the anterior guide pin setting cha nges the patient’s occlusal vertical dimension. In cases where the casts have been m ounted at the pa tient’s occlusal vertical dim ension (MI or centric relation), the  pin-flush rule helps eliminate the need for remembering where the anterior guide pin was set. vertical dim ension with a relation and the occlusal AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  189 6.14.6.1. Ac cording to the pin-flush  rule, the fo llowing co nditions sho uld be m et when the mounting is completed: the casts are at the occlusal vertical dimension, the pin is flush with the top of the articulator’s upper member (Hanau) or set at the zero reference line (Whip-Mix), and the pin contacts the anterior guide table. 6.14.6.2. The pin-flus h rule does not apply to m ountings where a m axillomandibular relationship record holds natural  or artificial teeth apart at a  distance other than the desired occlusal vertical dim ension. In these situati ons, the following steps are perform ed in order. Mount the upper cast. Open the anterior guidmaxillomandibular relationship r ecord. Mount the lower cast.

The slant of  an a rticular eminence relative to th e occlusal plane is a m ajor determinant of a m andibular movement. The angle may be the sam e, or it m ay differ  from  side to  side. After the patient’s  casts are m ounted on an articulator, the horizontal condylar guidances should  be inclined to match th e patient’s em inence-to-occlusal plane angles. The averag e m ethod is discussed in paragra ph 6.16; the interocclusal record method is discussed in paragraph 6.17. 6.16. Average Method: 6.16.1. The average setting of the horizontal condylar guidances on the Hanau and W hip-Mix articulators are the sam e. In the average m ethod, the horizontal guidance is set at the + 30 degree mark when the occlusal plane or plane of a record  rim is mounted parallel to the horizontal plane of the articulator (Figure 6.19). The  rationale for this procedure is  that for the average patient, the angle formed by the articular eminence and the occlusal plane equal + 30 degrees.  Figure 6.19. Average Setting of Horizontal Condylar Guidance. 190  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 6.16.2. The Hanau and W hip-Mix articulators are  machined so a horizontal condylar guidance  readout of 30 degrees m eans the  guidance is for ming a 30-degree  angle with the  articulator’s horizontal plane. This leads to  the conclusion that if a horizontal condylar  guidance readout of 30 degrees is supposed to represent a valid average, the occlusal plane or plane of the record rim must be mounted parallel to the horizontal plane of the articulator. 6.16.3. If the anterior portion of the occlusal plane  or plane of the record rim  has been m ade to deviate downward from parallel w ith the horizon tal, the 30 degree horiz ontal condylar guidance setting must be increased by the  amount of the deviation. F or example, if the anterior portion of the occlusal plane or plane of the record rim  deviates downward from horizontal by an estimated 10 degrees, the horizontal condylar guidance must be  set to read 40 degrees for the guidance and the occlusal plane or plane of the record rim to intersect at the valid average of 30 degrees (Figure 6.20). 6.16.4. If the anterior portion of the occlusal plane or plane of the record rim deviates upward from parallel with the horizontal, a 30-degree horizont al condylar guidance setting m ust be reduced by the amount of the deviation.  Figure 6.20. Horizontal Condylar Guidance Compensation for an Occlusal Plane Not Horizontally Oriented.  6.17. Interocclusal Record Method: 6.17.1. Hanau Articulators. Adjusting the horizontal condylar gu idance settings to the patient’s actual eminence inclinations requires mounting the maxillary and mandibular casts with a centr ic relation record or some centric position chosen by the dentist. In addition, the dentist must obtain a protrusive interocclusal relationship record from the patient. The pr otrusive record will be used to set the horizontal condylar gu idance angles.

In this respect, the m ethod differs from directions given for the Hanau H2 -158. After the upper member and cast are seated in the protrusive record, the  horizontal condylar guidances are adjusted  to touch the tops of the condylar elements. 6.17.2.2. The W hip-Mix articulator is som ewhat  more versatile than the Hanau H2-158. It accepts almost all lateral intero cclusal relationship records, while the Hanau H2-158 does not. Another advantage of the W hip-Mix is that the horizontal condylar guidance and lateral condylar guidances (progressive  sideshift) on one side can  both be set f rom a single la teral interocclusal relationship record. (Another lateral record is needed to set the other side.) 6.17.2.3. Chapter 1, Volum e 2, of this m anual contains a further explanation of using lateral interocclusal relationship records in the Whip-Mix technique. Lateral interocclusal relationship records ar e pref erred over a protrusive inter occlusal r elationship r ecord f or se tting the  horizontal condylar guidances of a Whip-Mix articulator. 6.18.  Temporomandibular  Joint  Characteristics  Governing  the  Timing  and  Direction  of Laterotrusion. The articulator counterpart of this patient  factor is the lateral condylar guidance feature of the Hanau H2-158 and Whip-Mix articulators. 6.18.1.  Average  Method. The average setting for the late ral condylar guidance on both Hanau articulators and Whip-Mix articulators is 15 degrees. 6.18.2. Interocclusal Record Method: 6.18.2.1.  Hanau  Articulators. Th e progres sive sidesh ift of  som e sem iadjustable articula tors (Whip-Mix) can be set from lateral interocclusal relationship records  made on the patient. The problem with a Hanau articulator is that it does not accept all lateral records. To compensate for this apparent lack of versat ility, the m anufacturer suggests the angle of  a person’s em inence, occlusal plane, and am ount of progressive m andibular translation (sides hift) are related. (Fo r example, the steep er the angle of the em inence, the greater the sideshift.) Hanau devised the tionship: L = H/8 + 12.  That is, the lateral following form ula to express this supposed relacondylar guidance setting (L) is  equal to the angle of the horizontal condylar guidance (H) divided by 8, to which 12 is added. 6.18.2.2. Whip-Mix Articulator. The dentist provides a right and left lateral record to set the  corresponding horizontal condylar  and lateral condylar guidances.  (See Chapter 1. Volum e 2, of this m anual.) A sta ndard W hip-Mix ar ticulator com es equipped with sideshift guides, allowing only progressive sideshift. Four a dditional sets of guides can be bought, allowing 0.25, 0.50, 0.65, or 1 mm of i mmediate sideshift in  conjunction with progressive sideshift. Using the theory that immediate sideshift increases as progressive sideshift increases, the Whip-Mix Corporation has m ade suggestions (shown in Table 6.1) for choosing among their range of sideshift guides. 192  Table 6.1.

Distance (Space) Between a Patient’s Condyles (Intercondylar Distance): 6.19.1.  Hanau  Articulators. The H anau articulators have a fixed intercondylar distance (110 mm). The word  fixed  means it cannot be changed. The 110  mm is supposed to represent theamount of space between an average person’s condyles. 6.19.2. Whip-Mix Articulator. The W hip-Mix 8500 series articu lator has condyle elem ents that adjust to three interelement distances; sm all (88 mm), medium (100 mm ), and large (112 mm ). When the distance between the elem ents is  changed, the condyle guidance m echanisms on the upper member must be aligned over the elements. The alignment is controlled by the intercondylar distance spacers. The 2000 and 3000 series have a fixed intercondyle distance of 110 mm.  6.19.2.1. Average Condyle Position. When the W hip-Mix articulator is used in the average  position, the condyle elements are placed at the medium setting (one spacer in place). 6.19.2.2.  Semiadjustable  Mode. In the W hip-Mix system , a  facebow transfer serves two purposes. It relates the upper cast to the condyle elements in the same way a patient’s upper jaw relates to the tem poromandibular joints. In addition, it regist ers the approxim ate intercondylar distance. When a dentis t uses a W hip-Mix facebow on a patient, the facebow dicates a sm all, medium, large, or intercondylar  distance by an indicator on th e front of the facebow. The condyle elements are adjusted to the proper setting before the upper cast is mounted. 6.20. Relative Presence or Absence of Anterior Guidance. Setting an articulator to accommodate this patient factor requires e ither maintaining existing horizontal and vertical overlaps between upper and lower teeth or developing new ones. The anterior guide table is the primary articulator control involved. In setting an anterior guide table, the following important considerations must be weighed: 6.20.1. When casts carrying natural teeth m ove in  and out of MI, stone  surfaces rub away. T he anterior guide table can be set to help prevent this. 6.20.2. If the patient has sufficient natural teeth present, does the occlusion show group function or anterior guidance? Under ordinary circumstances, the patient’s natural guidance patterns should be maintained. 6.20.3. If natural teeth are bad ly worn or complete ly missing, will the occlusion be resto red to show anterior guidance, group func tion, or bilateral balance?  The de ntist analyzes the restorative  problem and sets the anterior guid e table acco rdingly or directs the technician to set the p roper anterior guidance. 6.20.4.

Until the technician deve lops a sens e for the influ ence of  the anterior gu ide table as a control, he or she should depend on the dentist for guidance. 6.20.5. A mechanical anterior guide table can  be used with most articulators. The  chisel edge of the anterior guide pin is  used with the m echanical anterior guide table.  This guide table can be used to prevent the ab rasion of mounted ston e casts and  can provid e guidance when settin g denture teeth, but it cannot provide a permanent record of a patient’s anterior guidance. 6.20.5.1.

Reproducing th e patient’s sideshift in an articulator is one of the m ost important factors in achieving this goal. 6.21.2. It is not enough to casually grasp the anterior  guide pin of an articulator, pushing against it to move the upper m ember to the side, and call th is a lateral excursion.  The upper member of the articulator must be m oved laterally in a  very particular way to gua rantee sideshift occurs in th e amount corresponding to the lateral condylar guidance setting. contacts between natural or 194  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 6.21.3. To move the H anau H2-158 articulator, lo ck down the working side  condyle against the  centric stop and place a thum b on the workin g side condylar guide. To get full sideshift v alue, move the upper m ember toward the balancing side and push the condylar guide in the same direction (Figure 6.21). If the m ovement is done co rrectly, the shoulder of  the condylar shaft will remain in contact with the exte rnal surface of the balan cing condylar element during the entire course of th e upper m ember’s lateral travel.  Also, a sp ace will d evelop between  the condylar element and the brass stop extern al to the elem ent on the w orking side. The space represen ts the full amount of sideshift the lateral condylar guidance setting allows (Figure 6.22). 6.21.4. To produce a proper lateral movement in a Whip-Mix articulator, place your thumb on the working side horizontal condylar guide and push the back end of the u pper member toward the balancing side. Sim ultaneously, move the front pa rt of the upper m ember in the sam e direction with your other hand. The objective  is to keep the balancing side  condyle element in contact with its sideshift plate during the en tire lateral excursion (Figure 6.23) . The sideshift is the am ount of space between the working side condyle element and the sideshift plate. 6.22. Hanau Wide-Vue Series of Articulators: 6.22.1. The Hanau W ide-Vue series of arcon articul ators consists of eight basic m odels. The Wide-Vue models 183-1 through 183-4 have a closed condylar track, and the m axillary and mandibular members cannot be separated. The Wide-View II models 184-1 through 184-4 have an open condylar track, and the maxillary and mandibular members can be separated. 6.22.2. The lingual visibility w ith this series of articulators is excellent. The posterior openness allows tooth positioning and alignment with a minimum of visual obstruction from the body of the articulator. This type of  articulator has a dual- end anterior guide pin which allows the use of a mechanical guide table and the fabrication of a custom guide table.  Figure 6.21.

A unique and potentially useful  innovation is the Accumount mounting system used in the manufacture of Models 2240 and 2340 articulators.  During the production of these articulators, a  special mounting plate has been attached to the lower frame, using a special fixture and low-fusing alloy. 6.23.5. The relationship between maxillary and mandibular mounting plates has been checked and standardized. The manufacturer states that, because of this un ique mounting system, there can be an accurate interchange of m ounted casts b etween two Model 2240  or 2340 articu lators. T his feature allows the casts m ounted on one Model  2240 to be rem oved from the articulator and transported to a dental laborat ory. At the laboratory, the cast s are m ounted on a second Model 2240 to have the prosthesis fabricated. The dental office and laborato ry now require fewer articulators. Also, wear and tear on  these sen sitive instruments is reduced  because they are not being sent through the mail.  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 dental laboratory now  becomes even m ore 6.23.6.

A complete denture is a type of rem ovable prosthesis designed to replace  all of the natural teeth in an arch. The word “all” is used  with reservation because a com plete denture does not usually replace third molars and some situations require fewer teeth to be used. Patients sometimes need a set of complete dentures, one for each arch. 7.2. Steps in Complete Denture Construction. Complete dentures are fabri cated by using a series of steps the dentist and laboratory technician perf orm as a team  (paragraphs 7.2.1 through 7.2.18). Each step must be performed accurately and precisely. A slight error during any procedure can easily result in an unsatisfactory prosthodontic restoration. The m ajor steps in com plete denture construction are as follows: 7.2.1. The dentist makes preliminary impressions. 7.2.2. The technician pours diagnostic casts and fabricates custom trays. 7.2.3. The dentist makes final impressions. 7.2.4. The technician pours master casts. 7.2.5. The technician makes record bases with occlusion rims on the master casts. 7.2.6. The dentist uses the record bases with occlusion rim s to determ ine the am ount of facial muscle support the patient needs. The dentist then  contours the occlusion rim s to m ake a centric relation and occlusal vertical dimension jaw relationship record. 7.2.7. The technician uses a jaw relationship record  to mount master casts in an articulator. A jaw relationship record, as received from the dentist, is a cast-mounting template. 7.2.8. The technician constructs a wax trial denturdenture teeth. 7.2.9. The dentist checks the trial denture in the pa tient’s mouth for appearance and tooth contact relationships. The patient approves (or disapproves) the trial denture. 7.2.10. The technician makes all changes directed by the dentist. 7.2.11. After the patient and dentist approve the trial denture, the technician prepares it for investing. That is, the technician creates a uniform ly thick palatal vault area and perfects the surface contours of the wax trial denture. 7.2.12. The technician creates a mold by flasking the wax dentures into denture flasks. 7.2.13. The technician rem oves the record base m aterial and wax (boilout procedures) by heating and then separating the flasks and pouring boiling water over the cast to remove the wax. 7.2.14. The technician packs the molds with denture base resin and cures the resin. 7.2.15. The technician recovers cured dentures from  the m olds and rem ounts the dentures in the articulator to correct the occlusion. 7.2.16. The technician corrects processing errors (selective grinding). 7.2.17. The technician finishes and then polishes the dentures. e on the record bases, using the prescribed 198  7.2.18. The dentist delivers the dentures to the patient. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 7.3.  Normal  Denture  Construction  Procedures. The technician’s role is to pour im pressions, trim  casts, and finish dentures as part of normal denture construction procedures. 7.3.1. In com plete dentures, an im pression is an  accurate, negative likeness of a highly specific intraoral area. 7.3.2. A cast is a positive likeness poured from  an impression. When pouring an impression, there is a serious potential for omitting important impression features. After the gypsum product used to pour a cast sets, it is custom ary to trim the excess.  It is very crucial to discrim inate between cast areas that are excess and areas that are important to the success of the denture. 7.3.3. After processing the dentures in resin on thhighly abrasive substances. During finishing, be ex tremely careful not to inadvertently change the shape of a denture border. If this happens, it no longer corresponds to the original impression. e casts, finish and polish the dentures, using 7.4.  Relationships  Between  Impressions,  Casts,  and  Dentures. Standard im pression-cast-denture relationships are illustrated in Figures 7.1 and 7.2. For exam ple, the buccal frenum  of the m outh produces a buccal notch in the impression. When the impression is poured, a buccal frenum is visible on the cast. When the denture is made, the cast produces a buccal notch in the border of the denture. 7.5. Denture-Bearing Areas: 7.5.1. In the maxillary arch, the denture-bearing areas are the  residual ridge and hard palate. The border extensions of  a m axillary complete denture are lim ited by the  labial  sulci,  buccal  sulci, pterygomaxillary notches, and vibrating line. 7.5.2. The denture-bearing areas of the m andible are the  residual  ridge,  retromolar  pads,  and buccal shelves. The border extensions of a m andibular complete denture are determ ined by the labial  sulci,  buccal  sulci,  lingual  sulcus,  posterior  extent  of  the  retromylohyoid  space,  and posterior  extent  of  the  retromolar  pads.  NOTE:  The negative and positive likenesses of these anatomical landmarks must be maintained throughout the impression-cast-denture-process. 7.6. Muscles Shaping Impression Borders. The m uscles responsible for shaping im pression borders (flanges) are listed in Figure 7.3.  Section 7B—Functional Occlusions Organized for Complete Dentures 7.7. Complete Balance: 7.7.1. According to the fourth edition of the Glossary of Prosthodontic Terms, complete balance is “the simultaneous contacting of  the m axillary and mandibular teeth on the right and left in the posterior and anterior occlusal areas in centric and eccentric positions, developed to lessen or limit a tipping or rotating of the denture bases in relation to the supporting structures.” In sim pler language, just about all of the teeth are supposed occlusion and eccentric positions. In order to achfabricated with a compensating curve (Figure 7.4). to be able to contact everywhere in centric ieve this elusive ideal, dentures m ust be AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 7.1. Indentification of Maxillary Arch Impressions, Casts, and Dentures. 199  7.7.2. A compensating curve is an alignment of occluding surfaces and incisal edges along definite anteroposterior and lateral curvatures for purposes  of developing com plete balance in dentures.

In practice, the place where the compersonal denture philosophy. It also varies with example, the curve used with one  manufacturer’s teeth starts in the first prem olar region; a curve appropriate for a different tooth form  begins in  the first m olar area. (W hen in doubt, read the directions.) 7.7.4. One m ajor reason a com pensating curve  is necessary is the presence of the  Christensen’s Phenomenon (Figure 7.5). In this phenomenon, the condyles leave their fossae and move down the eminences until the incisors are edge to edge. If  the compensating curve in a denture is shallow or absent, the descent of the condyles down the artic ular eminences shows up as a gap between the teeth posterior to the contacting incisors (Figure 7.5-B). The space is sm allest anteriorly and becomes progressively greater posteriorly. pensating curve begins varies with each dentist’s the kind of posterior denture tooth used. For 200  Figure 7.2.

Recall that the occlusal plane of natural t eeth roughly conforms to the surface of a sphere. Then why are balancing side and posterior protrudentition? There are m any possible  reasons. Part of  the answer m ight be the existing curvatures are not pronounced enough to overcom e the Chri stensen’s phenom enon. Also, steep vertical overlaps between anterior teeth are very influential in causing separation of upper and lower posterior teeth, even though m arked curvatures  might be present. In Figure 7.5-C, enough of a compensating curve is present so most of the opposing teeth contact in protrusion. sive contacts usually absent in the natural 7.8.  Tooth  Contact  Characteristics  of  Completely  Balanced  Dentures. A com pletely balanced denture can be m ade using teeth with alm ost any cusp angle, from  0-degree through 33-degree teeth. However, most balanced complete dentures are made with cusped teeth. 7.8.1. Anterior Teeth. In centric occlusion there is about  1 mm of vertical and horizontal overlap between the maxillary and mandibular anterior teeth. 7.8.2. Working Side. The m axillary and m andibular anterior teeth on the working side contact each other. The posterior teeth exhibit what is called  cross tooth balance, which means the lingual inclines of the m axillary buccal cusps are in mandibular buccal cusps and the lingual inclines of the maxillary lingual cusps are in even contact with the buccal inclines of the mandibular lingual cusps. even contact with the buccal inclines of the AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 7.3.

The buccal inclines of the m axillary lingual cusps are in even contact with the lingual inclines of the m andibular buccal cusps, and there is no contact between upper and lower anteriors. 202  Figure 7.5.

Advantages of Completely Balanced Dentures: 7.9.1. Cusped teeth look more natural than 0-degree teeth. 7.9.2. Cusped teeth seem to break up food better than nonanatomic teeth. 7.9.3. Balanced dentures are somewhat resistant to tipping forces. (When a denture “tips,” one end pops up while the other stays down.) 7.10. Disadvantages of Completely Balanced Dentures: 7.10.1. Balanced dentures are more difficult to set. 7.10.2. Com pletely balanced dentures work well effective for patients with poor ridges. Cusped teet h set for balance are expected to m esh well in centric occlusion. If a patient’s residual ridge height is insufficient to support a balanced denture, lateral m andibular m ovement will cause the lowe r denture to dislodge and stay behind or the upper denture to lose its seal and travel with the laterally moving lower denture. 7.10.3. Precise records are required to accurately reproduce the m andible’s m ovements on the articulator. This involves a more careful and time-consuming technique. 7.10.4. With balanced dentures and cusped teeth, there is an increase in lateral forces which can be detrimental to the residual ridges. for patients with good ridges, but are not as 7.11. Nonbalanced Dentures. The only position in which tooth contact s are deliberately organized is in centric occlusion. Once the dentures leave centric occlusion, any contacts that develop in working, balancing, and protrusive excursions are present by chance. The contacts have not been intentionally programmed into the denture setup. This type of se tup is primarily used when a single denture opposes natural dentition or a partially edentulous arch. 7.12.  Using  Cusped  Teeth. In this type of setup, 20-degree (or less) posterior teeth are set along a modest com pensating curve in the tightest centric relationship is indicated, there will probably be maxillary and mandibular anterior teeth. Little attention is paid to interferences that might arise in lateral excursions.

In this denture occlusion, 0-degree teeth (no cusps) are set on a flat plane (no compensating curve). 7.14. Tooth Contact Characteristics of Nonbalanced Dentures: 203 7.14.1. Anterior Teeth. In centric occlusion, anterior teeth normally have a vertical overlap of 0.0 mm and 1 to 2 mm of horizontal overlap. 7.14.2. Working Side. There are isolated, unprogram med contacts among a few upper and lower teeth on the working side. 7.14.3.  Balancing  Side. On the balancing side, there is usupper and lower teeth. 7.14.4.

Disadvantages of Monoplane Dentures: 7.16.1. The 0-degree teeth don’t look as natural as cusped teeth. 7.16.2. The 0-degree teeth might not break up food as well as cusped teeth. 7.16.3. Monoplane dentures have m ore of a tendency to  tip than balanced com plete dentures. In fact, the lack of protrusive balance is a special invitation to tipping. 7.17. Lingualized Occlusion. This denture occlusion is very versatile and can use either the balanced or nonbalanced concept. Lingualized occlusion uses cusped m axillary posterior teeth set against 0-degree or shallow cusp m andibular posterior teeth. The m axillary lingual cusps acts as the m ajor functioning cusp occluding onto the mandibular teeth. 7.18. Tooth Contact Characteristics of Lingualized Occlusion: 7.18.1. Anterior Teeth. In centric occlusion, the anterior teeth have a vertical overlap of 1 m m and a horizontal overlap of 1 mm. 7.18.2. Working Side. The m axillary and m andibular anterior teeth on the working side contact each other. In the posterior, only the lingual inclin es of the m axillary lingual cusps are in even contact with the buccal inclines of the mandibular lingual cusps. 7.18.3. Balancing Side.

Advantages of Lingualized Occlusion: AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 7.19.1. There is maximized cutting efficiency with minimized lateral forces (denture base slide). 7.19.2. There are improved esthetics over purely 0-degree posterior teeth arrangements. 7.19.3. Maxillary cusp teeth break up food better. 7.19.4. Lingualized occlusion has a lim ited am ount of  lateral forces due to the sm all area of contact between the m axillary lingual cusp and the 0-degree m andibular teeth during lateral excursions. 7.19.5. This occlusion can be used for a wide variety of residual ridge conditions. 7.20. Disadvantages of Lingualized Occlusion. Lingualized occlusion is a com promise between using anatomic and nonanatom ic posterior tooth form s. In a nonbalanced setup, the dentures m ay still tip in contact positions other than centric occlusion due to the lack of balancing contacts.  Section 7C—General Rules for Pouring, Trimming, and Handling Casts 7.21. Impression Considerations To Obtain an Accurate Cast:  when pouring and trim ming a cast. (For 7.21.1. Always follow infection control guidelinesinformation, refer to Chapter 1, Section 1D.) 7.21.2. Pour the impressions as soon as possible. Keep in mind that alginate impressions should be poured within 10 to 15 m inutes after rem oval fr om the m outh and all im pression materials are subject to distortion. 7.21.3. Rem ove the m ucous film  and debris from   the surface of the im pression with a gentle stream of body tem perature water. Some manufacturers suggest “fixing” hydrocolloid im pression materials before pouring. An impression made from agar may require fixing by immersing it into a 2 percent solution of potassium  sulfate for 5 m inutes. This fixing im proves the surface detail and hardness of the cast. Most agar products now contain potassium  sulfate (an accelerator for the gypsum setting reaction), and soaking is no longer required. 7.22. Pouring Casts:  products are easily 7.22.1. Carefully follow the m anufacturer’s directions when preparing a m ix of gypsum  product. The  water-to-powder  ratio is absolutely critical. Because gypsumcontaminated by m oisture, preweigh them  into  convenient am ounts and store them  in airtight containers. Alternatively, purchase preproportioned, sealed packets of gypsum. 7.22.2. Use a proper separator, such as super sep, when pouring one gypsumanother. 7.22.3. Remember, the primary objective when pouring a cast is to capture all surface detail of the impression in as bubble-free a m anner as possible. Use a vibrating table to m ake a thick, gypsum  mix flow into all of the crevi ces of the im pression (Figure 7.6). The usual practice is to pour a small amount of the gypsum  product into a corner  of the impression and let it slowly advance to the other side.  m aterial against AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 7.6. Pouring a Typical Impression. 205  7.22.4. After covering the entire surf ace of the im pression, progressively larger am ounts of the mix may safely be added. There is a rate of vibration that is best for the characteristics of each mix of gypsum and type of im pression material. The  vibration intensity should be set high enough to make the m aterial move across the surface of the impression. The vibrator is set too high if the impression “jum ps” in your hand, if the m ix m oves so fast it skips over surface detail, or if vibration wave patterns develop on the surface of the mix which can cause entrapment of air. 7.23. Separating, Trimming, and Storing Casts:  of dehydration, the cast will probably show 7.23.1. Separate a cast from  an im pression after th e heat generated by the final setting reaction dissipates completely (about 45 minutes after pouring). If a cast is not separated from  an alginate impression before the alginate shows signsunacceptable surface dam age. Do not allow a poured  cast to stand in an alginate im pression for more than 1 hour. 7.23.2. For a m odeling plastic im pression (com monly called com pound), uniform ly heat the material in a water bath (140  oF) until it sof tens before attempting to separate the cast f rom the impression. 7.23.3. Do not trim a cast for at least 2 hours after it has reached the final set. 7.23.4. Rinse the cast in a container of saturated calcium  sulfate dihydrate solution (SDS) trimming procedure. Never trim  a dry cast on a  wet m odel trim mer because the slushy debris coming off the trim ming wheel falls on the dry surface and becom es permanently attached to the cast surface. Use only SDS for soaking or rinsing casts. 7.23.5. Make sure the cast includes all of the denture support areas and features that define denture borders. Keep the cast free of nodules or voids. W hen trim ming a m axillary cast, follow the general shape shown in Figure 7.7. Cut mandibular cast to correspond with the shape shown in the same figure. Fully represent the sulci areas in the cast, but not more than 3 mm deep. The sulci are routinely protected by a peripheral “land” area or ledge extending 4 mm outward. 7.23.6. Make sure the cast extends 5 mm beyond th e ptyerygom axillary notch areas of the maxillary arch and 5 m m beyond the retrom olar pads of the m andibular arch. A cast should be about 15 m m (5/8 inch) thick at its thinnest area (usually the palatal vault of the upper and the tongue space region of the lower). 7.23.7. Store the cast in a safe place to prevent damage. 206   Figure 7.7. Trimming Maxillary and Mandibular Casts. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  7.24. Preliminary Impressions: 7.24.1. Im pressions are m ade by carrying a suitable im pression m aterial to the m outh of the patient in a specially shaped container (im pression tray). There are two basic kinds of im pression trays; prefabricated and custom. 7.24.2. Prefabricated trays are available in a range  of types, shapes, and sizes. Figure 7.8 contains two types--maxillary rimlock (on the left) and maxillary edentulous (on the right). All preliminary impressions are made in prefabricated trays. T echnicians make custom trays on preexisting casts. Dentists m ake prelim inary im pressions as a fi rst step in m any prosthodontic treatm ent plans. Because casts m ade from these im pressions (diagnostic casts) are used to evaluate the patient’s dental problem s (diagnosis) as well as to make  custom trays, these casts m ust be m ade as accurately as master casts. 7.24.3. Alginate is the m aterial used to m ake  preliminary im pressions. Alginate im pressions brought into the laboratory should be poured immediately after disinfection is completed. Alginate impressions begin to distort within 10 to 15 minutes after the m aterial is rem oved from  the patient’s mouth. Placing the impression in a 100 pe rcent humid atmosphere (humidor) may retard the distortion. Even if a hum idor is available,  an alginate impression should be poured within 10 minutes after it is made. 7.25. Two-Step Method of Pouring a Diagnostic Cast: 7.25.1. To help prevent distortion caused by pressu re from its own weight, a poured im pression may be suspended by the handle from  a tray hol der (Figure 7.9). In a two-step m ethod, pour the anatomic portion first; then add the base as a second step (Figure 7.10).  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 7.8. Two Types of Prefabricated Trays. 207  Figure 7.9. Tray Holder.  7.25.2. For the first step, fill the anatom ical porti on of the im pression as described above, to include full-border coverage. To guarantee a union between the two pours, leave nodules and roughened peaks on the surface of th e first pour. After the final set, wet the first pour with SDS and invert it into a newly m ixed m ound of the sam e m aterial. W hile it is still soft, shape the mound to the desired size and thickness. This sec ond step forms a base. Build up a base thickness of about 18 m m (1/4 inch). Overbuild the base to com pensate for trim ming reductions. Separate and trim the cast as previously directed. 208  Figure 7.10. Two-Step Method of Pouring a Cast. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  7.25.3. In a mandibular impression, the second pour tends to creep up over the lingual flanges and lock the tray into the hardened m ix. A tray is  difficult to rem ove under these conditions, and the cast may be ruined in the process. To prevent this problem , invert the first pour onto the second mix of material without letting the tray becom e buried. While the material is still soft, flatten and shape the tongue area of a m andibular impression so the area is relatively sm ooth and is about 1 mm above (occlusal to) the lingual sulcus.  7.26. One-Step Method of Pouring a Diagnostic Cast. There are quicker ways of pouring diagnostic casts than the two-step method as follows: 7.26.1. Impressions must never be poured, then inverted into a mound of gypsum material to form the entire cast in one step. The m aterial tends to  settle toward the base while it is setting, leaving the softer m aterial toward the anatom ic areas of  the cast, producing a m arginally adequate cast. The gypsum mix has a tendency to fall away from  important impression borders, and the potential for soft cast surfaces can be greater. In addition, it is difficult to control the thickness of the base and the orientation of the anatomic portion to the base.  7.26.2. An impression may be filled with a m ix of gypsum product with enough m aterial stacked up for a base right on top (som etimes called the “upright m ethod”). This technique is m ore successful with maxillary than with mandibular impressions. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  209 7.26.3. Som e dentists request a “high m ount” pour of the diagnostic cast. In this m ethod, the impression is poured sim ilar to the upright m ethod, making sure the first pour is at least 15 m m thick in the dentulous areas and 10 m m thick ove r edentulous areas. Large retention nodules are placed, but no attem pt is m ade to develop a base. After final set and separation of the cast, the retention nodules are flattened slightly. This method is usually used when the dentist will be using the casts to m ake a diagnostic m ounting and will  have no need to rem ove the casts from  the mountings. 7.26.4. In general, though, it is best to depend on the two-step method. It will save time in the long run by ensuring the best cast quality.  Section 7D—Custom Trays 7.27. Overview: 7.27.1. Prefabricated trays are m ade to fit everyone  moderately well, but these trays fit no one perfectly. On the other hand, a custom  tray provi des an im pression material carrier which helps the dentist m ake a m ore accurate im pression th an he or she could m ake by using a stock (prefabricated) tray. 7.27.2. The custom tray is made on a diagnostic cast.  The dentist draws the border outlines of the proposed custom  tray on the diagnostic cast and gives other design directions (such as handle position, amount and placem ent of wax spacer if requi red, and the need for vertical stops). The tray is then made to conform to the design. 7.27.3. Some of the m ore popular ways of m aking custom trays are the  self-curing resin dough method  (paragraph 7.28),   vacuum  method  (paragraph 7.29),   and  light  cured  material  method (paragraph 7.30). 7.28. Self-Curing Resin Dough Method. This is a bulk m ethod for using resin as opposed to “sprinkle on” methods. 7.28.1. Preparing the Cast. First, use baseplate wax to generously fill in all undercuts within the tray area outlined on the cast (Figure 7.11-B). Nextsubstitute to prevent the acrylic resin from sticking. 7.28.2. Molding the Dough. Use a sim ple stone m old to control the shape and thickness of the resin dough (Figure 7.12). This preshaped resin m ass results in a tray of consistent quality when adapted to the cast. Once m ade, the m old may be used indefinitely. Making a m old is a sim ple procedure following the steps as outlined below:  paint the cast with two layers of tinfoil other sheet the shape of  a m andibular arch not 7.28.2.1. Using two sheets of athletic m outhguard  material, cut one sheet the shape of a maxillary arch to include the palate. Cut the including the tongue space. 7.28.2.2. Place each of the sheets of athletic  mouthguard on a slab and pour gypsum  15 m m (5/8 inch) thick over the material to include the edges. 7.28.2.3. Remove the m outhguard material after the  stone mix sets and lightly petroleum  the recesses. 7.28.2.4. Cut a 6-inch length of 1 -inch diameter dowel to use as a roller. 7.28.3. Fabricating the Tray: 7.28.3.1. Mix the m onomer and polym er components of the autopolym erizing resin. Always 210  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 follow the m anufacturer’s m onomer-polymer pr oportioning directions. Allow the m ix to set until it reaches a dough-like consistency. 7.28.3.2. Always wear gloves when handling acrylic  resin. Lightly coat the glove fingers with petrolatum before handling the dough. Also ensure that the m old is coated with petrolatum . When resin becom es doughy, rem ove from mixing container and quickly kneed the dough to ensure thorough m ixing of the polym er and m onomer. Place the resin into the stone m old. Cover the resin with a polyethylene sheet, and then  roll out the resin to match the mold’s shape and thickness (Figure 7.11-C).  Figure 7.11. Fabricating a Maxillary Custom Tray (Autopolymerizing Resin).   ylic resin blank from  the m old. Store 7.28.3.3. Trim  away any excess dough and lift the acrexcess acrylic in a jar to use later for fabricating a tray handle. 7.28.3.4. Center the resin over the cast and rapidly adapt the dough to the cast’s surfaces (Figure 7.11-D). Be careful not to create thin s pots by pressing too hard.  Shape the resin to the borders and cut away the excess with a sharp knife. 7.28.3.5. Attach a handle to the tray (Figure 7.11- E). Ensure the handle is strong enough to withstand considerable force and its shape  does not interfere with lip movements. If you work fast enough, you should be able to use the unpolym erized excess from  the first m ix for the handle. If not, mix another small amount of tray resin. When polymerization reaches the dough stage, form it into an “L.” Use a few drops of monomer to moisten the attachment site between AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  the handle and the tray. Press the base of monomer should provide good bonding.  the handle onto the m oistened area. The fluid 211 Figure 7.12. Baseplate Mold for Autopolymerizing Resin Material.   7.28.4.  Finishing  the  Tray. After the acrylic resin has set, re move the tray from  the cast. The posterior border of a m axillary custom tray is  supposed to extend a short distance onto the soft palate. Mandibular custom  trays cover the retrom olar pads. Trim  the tray’s flanges back to the dentist’s peripheral border m arkings. Use an ar bor band to rem ove bulk. Use acrylic finishing stones and burs for finer details. Make sure th ere are no sharp edges on the tray’s borders.  NOTE: Making custom trays from  autopolymerizing resin dough gives excellent results. Made this way, the trays are rigid and dimensionally stable. Most of the time, this is the preferred method.  7.29.  Vacuum  Method. The vacuum  m ethod (Figure 7.13) is a viable alternative to the autopolymerizing resin dough method. 7.29.1. Equipment and Materials. For this procedure, use a unit capable of vacuum -forming a plastic sheet (therm oplastic vinyl resi n). (The com mercially available OMNIVAC ® unit f alls in this category.) Plastic sheets com e preformed to f it the m achine and in color-coded thicknesses appropriate for different purposes. Custom  trays are m ade from extra weight (0. 125 inch) tray material. 7.29.2. Cast Preparation. For a handle, cut a scrap piece of tray material 1-inch long and 1/2-inch wide and round off the corners on one end. Attach the square end to the cast surface with sticky wax. Place it on the anterior residual ridge in the m idline and stand it up perpendicular to the cast (Figure 7.13-B). Thoroughly wet the cast with SDS. Block out all undercuts with wet tissue. 7.29.3. Tray Formation. Place a sheet of tray m aterial in  the sliding carriage of the OMNIVAC and raise the carriage com pletely. Switch on the  heating element and position it directly over the tray material. Place the cast on the vacuum base. When the plastic sheet sags about 1 inch, turn on the vacuum  m otor. Lower the sliding carriage and bring the tray material down over the cast 212  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 (Figure 7.13-C). Swing the heating elem ent aside. Position the impression tray handle at an angle that is 45 degrees to the base of the cast. Turn o ff the heating elem ent. When the tray m aterial is cool, turn off the vacuum motor. 7.29.4. Tray Finishing. Draw a line on the tray m aterial indicating the outer edge of the cast’s land area (Figure 7.13-D). Use a separating disc to  follow the line and cut through the plastic to the cast (Figure 7.13-E). After com pleting the cut, se parate the tray and the cast from  the excess. Lift the tray off the cast. For m andibular trays, use the separating disc to cut away the bulk of the tongue space. ALW AYS WEAR SAFETY GL ASSES WHEN USING A SEPARATING DISC. Use an arbor band to trim the border of the tray down to the design. Use an acrylic finishing stone to round the edges. Clean away any remaining tissue or sticky wax.  Figure 7.13. Custom Tray Fabrication by the Vacuum Method.   7.30. Light-Cured Material Method. Light-cured materials are becoming popular because of their ease of use and quickness in making a tray. 7.30.1. A light curing unit is needed to thoroughly cure the m aterial. Materials come prepackaged for consistent size and thickness. The Dentsply International ® Triad system  is a com plete light-cured system for making custom trays. 7.30.2. Block out cast undercuts with wax or m olding compound. Then apply a separator to the cast. 7.30.3. Adapt the tray material to the cast, being careful not to create any thin areas. Once the tray material is rem oved from the m anufacturer’s package, the working tim e of the m aterial begins. Light in the working area will star t the curing process. Position the wire support for the handle in the uncured tray (Figure 7.14-A). Add the m aterial around the wire support to form  a tray handle (Figure 7.14-B). AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  213 7.30.4. Cure the tray in a light-curing unit for two  minutes (Figure 7.14-C). Remove the tray from the cast and apply the m anufacturer’s air barrier coating on all sides. Cure the tray for an additional 8 minutes. 7.30.5. Finish the tray to the design line with carsmooth and has no sharp edges (Figure 7.14-D). The tray  may also be perforated to help retain the impression material.  bide burs, ensuring the peripheral border is Figure 7.14. Custom Tray Fabrication by the Light-Cured Method.   7.31.  Custom  Tray  Spacer  Modifications.  In the preceding technique descriptions (paragraphs 7.28 through 7.30), the trays were closely adapted to the diagnostic cast. However, m ore often than not, the dentist prefers a tray that provides room  for cont rolled thickness of im pression material (Figure 7.15). Spacers used to develop tissue stops accomplish this purpose. The stops are made to hold the tray off the cast by a distance equal to the thickness of the spacer. When the spacer is removed and the tray is placed in the patient’s mouth, the stops hold the inner surface of the tray out of contact with the patient’s tissue. The space between the tray and the tissue is filled with a very accurate, relatively fluid im pression material called a wash (such as zinc oxide and eugenol paste) or rubber base. 7.31.1. Self-Curing Resin Trays: 7.31.1.1. Adapt a layer of baseplate wax to the bl ockout design line on the diagnostic cast after you fill in the undercuts. If prescribed, cut out  four small pieces of the baseplate wax over the crest of the ridge at areas outlined in the molar and canine regions. 214  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 7.31.1.2. Apply a tinfoil substitute to the gypsum  surf aces of the cast to prevent the acrylic resin from sticking. Apply a thin layer of petroleum to the surface of the baseplate wax to make removing the wax from the polymerized tray easier. Use the self-curing dough method to make the tray.  Figure 7.15. Custom Tray Wax Spacer.   7.31.1.3. After the resin is hard, rem ove the tray  from the cast and pull the baseplate wax off the tissue surface of the tray. Som e dentists may require the blockout wax to remain in the tray until the final impression is taken. If tissue stops are used, they should appear on the ridge areas where the four pieces of baseplate wax were originally cut out. Trim any excess acrylic resin to the outline border on the cast. Round and smooth the borders of the tray. 7.31.1.4. Be sure to clean away asurface of the tray. Shellblasting does this very effectively. ll traces of petrolatum  that m ight be present on the tissue 7.31.2. Vacuum-Formed Trays: 7.31.2.1. As described in paragraph 7.29.2, use sticky wax to attach the handle to the dry cast. Fill in the undercuts with wet tissue or som e other heat-resistant substitute. Adapt one or two layers of wet tissue (about 2 m m thick) to prescribed, cut four tissue stops through the tissu e layer (down to the cast) and place the stops in the second molar and canine regions.  7.31.2.2. Operate the OMNIVAC or sim ilar unit.  As soon as the carriage is dropped, use a blunt instrum ent to adapt the tray m aterial  into the tissue stops. Cut away the excess tray material, remove the tray from the cast, and trim it to predetermined borders. the cast surfaces, including the peripheries. If 7.31.3. Light-Cured Tray Method: 7.31.3.1.

The dentist uses the custom  tray to m ake  a final im pression of the patient. In m ost aster cast.  Boxing the cases, final, com plete denture im pressions are boxed before pouring the mimpression represents a way of confining the flow density of the cast. This is the best m ethod to make sure that all peripheral borders are com plete. There are several ways to box an im pression. The m ethod selected depends on the kind of wash m aterial the dentist used. (See paragraphs 7.33 and 7.34.) 7.33.  Wax  Bead,  Box,  and  Pour  System.  This m ethod (Figure 7.16) can be used with all final impression materials, but is particularly suited for elastic materials such as zinc oxide and eugenol paste or impression plaster.  Figure 7.16. Wax Bead, Box, and Pour System. of the stone to control the shape, thickness, and  7.33.1. Maxillary Impression: 7.33.1.1. Carefully adapt a strip of utility wax ar ound the impression (3 mm from the edges of the flanges.) Extend the wax strip across the pos terior border, about 6 mm behind the vibrating line. Make the beading on one side continuous with the beading on the other. Lute (seal) the wax to the tray with a hot spatula. To avoid possible damage to the impression, seal the beading to the tray from the side opposite the flange edges. 7.33.1.2. Build a sidewall around the circum ference of the beading to provide an enclosure or “box” into which artificial stone can be poure d. Make the sidewall of boxing wax or baseplate wax cut wide enough to extend 15 m m (5/8 inch) above the highest point on the im pression. Just as you sealed the beading to the tray from  the side opposite the flange edges, do the sam e when you lute the boxing m aterial to the beadi ng. Water test the assem bly for leaks by filling the impression with water. The maxillary final impression is now boxed and ready for pouring. 7.33.2. Mandibular Impression: 7.33.2.1. Box the m andibular impression the sam e way you boxed the m axillary impression. EXCEPTIONS: From  the distal 1/3 of the buccal flange, across the posterior border of the 216  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 retromolar fossa, and down to the retrom ylohyoid eminence on each heel, use two thicknesses of utility wax to provide an adequate land area on the resultant cast. 7.33.2.2. Continue the beading wax around the outlin e of the lingual area 3 m m distant from  the edges of the lingual flanges. Fill in the lingual area with baseplate wax luted to the beading. After the impression is boxed, test it for leaks and pour the cast. 7.34. Plaster-Pumice Matrix, Box, and Pour System: 7.34.1. Overview. The small amount of force used to m old boxing m aterial around a utility wax bead sometimes alters the shape of a final im pression made with an elastic im pression material. The plaster-pum ice m atrix, box, and pour system   is appropriate for boxing any kind of final elastic  impression  material. The m atrix is impression, but is particularly suited when using an composed of equal volum es of plaster and coarse  pumice. Pumice is incorporated into the plaster to weaken the matrix and make separation of the pour ed cast easier. It is this m atrix that supports the tray and edges of a final im pression made with an elastic im pression material of rubberbase, silicone, etc. 7.34.2. Maxillary Impression: 7.34.2.1. With a small piece of clay, support the tray  about 12 mm (1/2 inch) off the surface of the table. Take the tray with the attached clay and put it aside. Stack a slushy, yet cohesive, mound of the 50/50 plaster pum ice mix on a flat,  nonabsorbent surface. Make the patty about 12 mm larger than the diam eter of the im pression. Place the im pression and clay stop into the patty tissue side up. 7.34.2.2. Manipulate the m atrix mix so 1.5 m m of fl ange height is visible all the way around, exposing at least 6 m m of the im pression’s surf ace posterior to the vibrating line. Ensure enough of the matrix mix remains around the circumference of the impression to create a ledge at least 8 mm wide. 7.34.2.3. Let the m atrix achieve initial set. Hold a razor-sharp blade at right angles to the flanges and carefully (and uniform ly) cut to e xpose 3 m m of the flanges. After the m atrix reaches final set, trim a 6 mm land area around the circumference with a cast trimmer. 7.34.2.4. Paint the land area with two co ats of a suitable stone to stone separator such as Super Sep®. Wrap the m atrix with boxing wax that sta nds 15 m m (5/8 inch) above the im pression’s highest point and lute the wax to the matrix. Water test the boxed impression for leaks and pour the cast. 7.34.3. Mandibular Impression: andibular im pression the sam e as the m7.34.3.1. Box the mEXCEPTIONS: Use two pieces of clay—one on the right and the other on the left in the first molar areas—to hold the tray (especially the heels) 12 m m (1/2 inch) of f the table (Figure 7.17). 7.34.3.2. Before the m atrix reaches its initial set, try to create a sm oothly contoured tongue space. Complete the contouring of the tongue space with a sharp knife after the final set. Make a 6 mm wide land area. Extend it fr om the distal 1/3 of the buccal flange, across the posterior border of the retrom olar fossa, and down to  the retromylohyoid eminence on each heel. Paint two to three coats of separator onto the land and tongue space regions. axillary im pression. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 7.17. Plaster-Pumice Matrix, Box, and Pour System. 217   7.35. Pouring Master Casts: 7.35.1. Most final im pression m aterials do not require  a coating of separator before a cast is poured. However, impression plaster is the exception. Pouring a cast against im pression plaster without the use of an intervening separator causes the impression and the stone to bond together. 7.35.2. Before pouring a cast, proportion the water  and gypsum according to the m anufacturer’s directions. Spatulate the m ixture thoroughly to  obtain a hom ogeneous m ix. To obtain a dense, accurate cast, always vacuum  spatulate stone fo r final im pressions. Place a sm all quantity of the mix in the boxed im pression on the vibrator and m ake it flow around the im pression. Continue to add small quantities of stone until the tissue surface  of the impression is covered; somewhat more rapidly, fill the boxing to the desired level. 7.36. Separating and Trimming Master Casts: 7.36.1. After the stone has final set (according to the m anufacturer’s directions), rem ove the boxing materials. If a plaster-pum ice matrix was used, the m atrix should break away cleanly and easily. 7.36.2. Some dentists make their own m odeling plastic trays at chairside to carry corrective wash materials. Others use modeling plastic to form the borders of custom resin trays before they m ake a final im pression. If m odeling compound was used  in the final im pression procedure, place the 218  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 assembly in 140 oF water for 3 minutes so it will separate. After separating a cast from any kind of impression, always inspect the cast’s surface fo r inaccuracies (irregular voids and positive and negative bubbles). 7.36.3. Casts poured from  properly boxed im pressions require minimal trimming. Dip the cast in SDS, use the cast trim mer to f latten the base  (15 m m thick), and produce land areas of proper dimensions as discussed in paragraphs 7.23.4 and 7.23.5. Rinse the debris from the cast with SDS. indexing  grooves  into the base of  the cast. These 7.36.4.

Record bases with occlusion rim s (Figure 7.19) are a com bination of a base material that accurately fits the  cast (record base) and an arch-shaped wax buildup (occlusion rim ) that occupies the space formerly occupied by the patient’s natural teeth. 7.38.  Primary  Uses.  Primary uses for record bases with occlusion rim s (paragraphs 7.38.1 through 7.38.6) are to: 7.38.1. Help the dentist select and properly pospositions the labial surfaces of the occlusion required by the patient. The dentist then adjusts th e vertical length of the maxillary occlusion rim to indicate the length of the incisor teeth. Some dentists scribe marks on the occlusion rims as aids in choosing and positioning denture teeth (Figur e 7.20). The m arkings are usually m ade on the maxillary occlusion rim, but they occasionally carry over onto the mandibular rim. rims to approxim ate the am ount of lip support ition denture teeth. The dentist shapes and 7.38.1.1. Midline Marking. The m idline marking represents  the center of the patient’s face. The incisive papilla is also a good guide.  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 7.19. Record Base With Occlusion Rim. 219  Figure 7.20. Occlusion Rim Markings.  7.38.1.2. High Lip Line. Some dentists m ark the high lip  line on the m axillary rim. This line indicates the level to which the upper lip rises wh en the patient sm iles. It helps determ ine the gingivoincisal length of  maxillary denture teeth  so the patient displays a m inimum of denture base. 7.38.1.3. Canine Lines. Canine lines are placed on the right and left sides. They represent the estimated positions of the long axis of the canin es. The distance between the lines is used to select the proper width of the six anterior teeth. The usual procedure is to make a measurement around the labial surface of the occlusion rim, from canine line to canine line, and add 8 mm. If a tooth’s long axis roughly splits it down the m iddle, the 8 mm accounts for the distal halves of both canines. In addition, the combined width of the maxillary posterior teeth in a quadrant can be estimated by measuring between the canine lin e and the m esial beginnings of the maxillary tuberosity. 7.38.2. Help the dentist determ ine the corr ect occlusal vertical dim ension. (NOTE: If terms like correct occlusal vertical dimension, centric relation, and physiologic rest are unfamiliar, refer to 220  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 Chapter 5.) A dentist m ight use the following seque nce of steps to determ ine a patient’s correct occlusal vertical dimension. The dentist: 7.38.2.1. Makes it a point to start the procedure w ith occlusion rim s that obviously hold the jaws too far apart. It causes the patient to slur “S” sounds badly and the occlusion rim s to hit when he or she attempts to speak. 7.38.2.2. Makes a physiologic rest position m easurement and quickly reduces the vertical height of the wax rims to match the measurement. 7.38.2.3. From  this point on, very carefully cuts bcontinually tests the patient’s speaking abilities. 7.38.2.4. Reaches the correct occlusal vertical  dimension when pronunciation of the “S” sound is distinct and the occlusion rims barely miss each other when the sound is spoken. ack the height of the occlusion rim s and 7.38.3. Enable the dentist to m ake a com bined occl usal vertical dim ension and centric relation record. This is a type of lower to upper jaw relationship record consisting of occlusion rims locked together at the correct occlusal vertical dimension estimate in centric relation. The dentist: 7.38.3.1. Makes an estimate of the correct occlusal vertical dimension as described above. 7.38.3.2. Positions the mandible in centric relation. 7.38.3.3. Keys or seals occlusion rim s together  and, ideally, m akes a facebow transfer. The dentist removes the entire assembly from the patient’s mouth and gives it to the technician. 7.38.4. Enable the technician to use the occlusal vertical dim ension and centric relation record made from the record bases with occlusion rim s to m ount the patient’s casts on the articulator (Figure 7.21). 7.38.5. Act as a matrix or foundation for arranging denture teeth. 7.38.6. Develop a wax trial denture on the record base s. Before a denture is processed in plastic, the dentist uses the wax trial denture to verify that jaw relations and denture esthetics are correct.  Section 7G—Record Bases 7.39.  Construction  Characteristics.  To be used successfully, record bases should have certain construction characteristics because they are made to cover the identical surfaces the completed dentures cover. 7.39.1. The bearing areas in the m axillary arch are the  residual ridges and hard palate. Maxillary labial sulci, buccal sulci, pterygomaxillary notches, and record base borders are defined by the vibrating line. The dentist should have marked the vibrating line on the cast. 7.39.2. The bearing areas in the m andibular arch are the  residual  ridges,  retromolar  pads, and buccal  shelves. Mandibular denture base borders are defined by the labial  sulci,  buccal  sulci, lingual sulcus, retromylohyoid spaces, and posterior extent of the retromolar pads. 7.39.3. An accurate fit is vital. A record  base must be made to fit a cast  exactly. Once adapted to cast contours, the record base must keep its shape without breaking.  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 7.21. Use of Record Bases With Occlusion Rims to Mount Casts. 221  7.39.4. Record bases can be m ade from either light-cured material or autopolymerizing resin, but autopolymerizing resin is preferred because it is stronger and more stable. 7.39.5. In keeping with mandatory requirements for strength and stability, some mandibular record bases may need to be reinforced with a “U” shaped piece of coat hangar wire. The wire is adapted to the lingual sulcus area of the residual ridge, anteri or to the right and left  premolar regions. It is then embedded in the substance of the record base. 7.39.6. Last, but definitely not least, record bases must be neat, clean, and smooth enough to place in the patient’s mouth without causing discomfort. 7.40. Fabricating an Autopolymerizing Acrylic Record Base: 7.40.1. Sprinkle-On Method (Figure 7.22): 7.40.1.1. Use wax to block out the undercuts. Paint a tinfoil substitute onto the tissue surfaces and land areas of the m aster cast. After th e tinfoil substitute dries, use a spoon-shaped instrument or a shaker to sprinkle autopolym erizing acrylic resin evenly over a section of the cast. 222  Figure 7.22.

Do not bathe the polymer with m onomer because such a m ixture will flow uncontrollably. The suggested sequence of application is labial and buccal fl anges, lingual and palatal areas, and finally the ridge crests. 7.40.1.3. Continue the application until the cast supolymerize under water in a pressure pot with 110 and round the border of the record base with an arbor band or acrylic bur. 7.40.1.4.

Loosely adapt one sheet of baseplate wax to the cast. Extend the borders of the wax just shy of the peripheral rolls. Remove the sheet wax form and set it aside. Apply a coat of tinfoil substitute. 7.40.2.2. Mix a 2:1 ratio of polym er to m onomer. ( NOTE:  20 cc of polym er to 10 cc of monomer should be enough for most record bases.) Let the mix set until it develops some body. Place the resin into the peripheral roll areas firs t; put the rem aining resin in the wax form  and position it on the cast. Push down on the wax f orm lightly and evenly until the resin layer is thinned uniformly 1 to 2 m m thick under the wax  form. Ensure the peripheral roll is full and trim away excess resin on the outside of the wax form. 7.40.2.3. After the resin has set in  a pressure pot with 110  oF water at 15 lb/in 2 for 10 minutes, carefully remove the record base from  the cast.  Trim excess resin from  the record base with a cherry stone or an arbor band.  NOTE:  Do not polish acrylic resin record bases. The heat generated by polishing procedures often causes warpage. 7.41. Fabricating a Light-Cured Record Base (Figure 7.23): e m aster cast and apply a coating of 7.41.1. Block out any undesirable undercuts on thmanufacturer’s separator. Carefully adapt the record base material to the cast. 7.41.2. Ensure the peripheral roll is full and do not over  thin material over the crest of the ridge. If wax is used as undercut relief, cure the record  base in the curing unit for one m inute to “set” the material. Then remove the record base from the cast and remove any wax remaining on the record base to prevent melting of the wax during curing. 7.41.3. Apply the m anufacturers air barrier coating to  all surfaces and cure the record base for an additional 9 m inutes. Finish any excess m aterial from the borders leaving the peripheral roll full and rounded. 7.42.  Stabilizing  Record  Bases. Record bases are subject to distortion and m ay require stabilizing procedures to ensure a good fit.  Stabilization usually means lining the tissue surface of a record base with a secondary substance that reproduces cast contour s better than the original record base m aterial. This improves the fit, both on the cast and in the  mouth. Common stabilizing substances are zinc oxide-eugenol paste, rigid self-curing acrylic resin, and resilient self-curing resin. 7.42.1. Stabilization Using Rigid Lining Materials. These substances are used on casts with no natural undercuts or where existing undercuts are  blocked out. The following two m ethods can be used on acrylic resin record bases: 7.42.1.1. Zinc Oxide-Eugenol Paste Stabilization. Block out cast undercuts with wax. Apply a thin layer of petrolatum to the tissue surfaces of the cast, and adapt a sheet of .001-inch tinfoil to the cast’s contours. A piece of cotton roll m akes an effective burnisher and will not tear the tinfoil if used carefully. Mix zinc oxidemanufacturer’s directions and spread it evenly  over the tissue surface of  the record base. Place the record base over the tinf oiled areas of the master cast and seat firmly. Hold it in place until the paste sets. Rem ove the record base f rom the cast. The zinc oxide-eugenol paste will have stuck to both the record base and the foil, with the foil remaining attached to the record base. Trim and smooth the lose edges of the foil. -eugenol im pression paste according to the 224  Figure 7.23. Method of Fabricating a Light-Cured Record Base. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005   7.42.1.2. Rigid, Self-Curing Acrylic Resin. Fill in cast undercuts with the wax. Paint on the tinfoil substitute. Trim the record base 2 m m short of contact with the peripheral border of  the cast. Pour a polymer-monomer mix (use a 2:1 ratio) of self-curing resin on the tissue surface of the record base and spread it evenly. Seat the record base firm ly on the cast and allow it to set for 30 minutes. Remove the record base from the cast and trim away the rough edges. 7.42.2. Stabilization Using Resilient Autopolymerizing Resin. Record base stability is inversely proportional to the amount of blockout performed on a cast. As the amount of blockout increases, the stability of the record base decreases. A record  base adapted to fit into m oderate undercuts, which springs in and out of those undercuts  without perm anently deform ing, is close to being ideal. An excellent way to m eet this requirement is to make a record base that is a com bination of rigid and resilient autopolym erizing resins. The resilient resin com pletely fills in m oderate undercuts. The rigid resin form s the body of the r ecord base, and the two kinds of resin bond at their interface. As shown in Figure 7.24 and the following subparagraphs: AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  225 7.42.2.1. Apply tinfoil substitute to the cast and let it dry. 7.42.2.2. Mix resilient autopolym er, such as  Coe-Soft® (Coe Laboratories, Inc) or  Dura Base® (Reliance Dental Mfg Co), in a dappen dish.  Wait until the mixture reaches a semi-runny state. Apply the mix with a cement spatula and liberally fill cast undercuts. 7.42.2.3. Sprinkle on an autopolym erizing, hard acrylic  resin. (This part of the record base should be about 2 mm thick.) Follow the procedure outlined in paragraph 7.40.1. 7.42.2.4. Because resilient autopolym erizing resin  remains somewhat tacky after it sets, dust the cast with  talc to avoid “rolling up” the resilient part. This allows the record base to slide into the undercuts.  Figure 7.24. Stabilizing a Resin Record Base with Resilient Autopolymerizing Resin.  Section 7H—Occlusion Rims 7.43.

If an occlusion rim  former is used (Figure  7.25), apply petrolatum  jelly to the halves to prevent wax from sticking. Place the lubricated rim  former on a well lubricated glass slab and fill the rim  form er with m olten baseplate wax. The wa x can be heated in an electric wax pot or ceramic pickling dish held over an open f lame. Slightly overfill the rim former to compensate for solidification shrinkage.  Figure 7.25.

Another, less desirable technique is to socylinder, and place the softened wax cylinder betw een the two separated parts of the rim  former. Then force the halves together, and trim  the excess wax flush with the edge of the m old. Remove the wax horseshoe when it hardens. 7.44.3. In the freehand method, baseplate wax is simply rolled lengthwise into a tight cylinder, and then it is shaped to the cast’s arch form (Figure 7.26). 7.44.4. Whichever way the m ass of the rim  is m olded, it m ust be attached to the record base. A wax rim is centered over the crest of the residual ri dge and sealed to the record base with m olten wax.

Review Chapter 6 for a refresher on the types and uses of articulators. A Hanau® or similar semiadjustable articulator is commonly used for making removable prostheses.  7.46.2. At this point, the dentist has given the techni cian a centric relation and occlusal vertical dimension jaw relationship record. Included in this record are occlusion rim s that have been contoured to guide the positioning of teeth  faciolingually; a trimmed maxillary occlusion rim that will guide  vertical  positioning  of m axillary  anterior  teeth; and canine, high lip, and m idline markings on the m axillary occlusion rim  act as guides to  denture tooth selection. The m axillary and mandibular occlusion rim s also have been keye d or fused together at the patient’s occlusal vertical dimension and in centric relation. 7.46.3. The cast m ounting procedure is used to oriecondylar elements in the sam e way that the patie nt’s upper jaw relates to the tem poromandibular joints. The procedure is also used to duplicate the patient’s occlusal vertical dimension and centric relation. nt the m axillary cast to the articulator’s 7.47. Mounting the Maxillary Cast. The position of the cast in the articulator should approxim ate the position of the patient’s m axilla in relation to bot h temporomandibular joints. Depending on what the dentist thinks the case requires, the mmeasurement of the patient. ounting m ay be based on an educated guess or an actual 7.47.1. Arbitrary, Average, or Educated Guess Method: 7.47.1.1. Because an arbitrary m ounting is an estim ate of where the m axillary cast should be positioned, this type of m ounting has certain lim itations. The dentist cannot be confident that lateral excursion tooth contacts developed in the  articulator are correct when the patient m oves the m andible laterally. W hen testing a wax tria l denture in the patient’s m outh, the dentist sometimes discovers that the occlusal vertical dimension estimate was incorrect. 7.47.1.2. In cases where an  arbitrary mounting of the m axillary cast has been used, incorrect registration of the occlusal vertical dim ension requires the dentist to m ake a new occlusal vertical dimension estimate and a new record of  centric relation on the patient. This corrected jaw relationship record is then used to m ount the mandibular cast again. Of course, the teeth in the wax trial denture have to be set in new positions. 7.47.1.3. The procedures associated with an arbitr ary or average m axillary cast m ounting are to: 7.47.1.3.1. Key the casts. This allows the cast to  be accurately repositioned on the mounting when the need arises. 7.47.1.3.2. Attach mounting rings to the articulator. A pply a light coat of petrolatum jelly to the mounting rings to protect them from corrosion and extend their usefulness. 7.47.1.3.3. Use the centric locks to lock the condylar elements against the centric stops. 7.47.1.3.4. Check the articulator settings. Make the incisal guide pin flush with the top of the upper member. Set the horizontal condylar guida nce at 30 degrees on the horizontal scale. Rotate the posts to 15 degrees on the lateral c ondylar indicator scale. Set the incisal guide table and its wings at 0 degrees. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  229 ecord assem bly (Figure 7.28). Seat the 7.47.1.3.5.

Be sure the occlusion rim s are properly oriented, one to the other. Reinforce the asse mbly with pieces of coat hanger wire. Make sure there is no   trace of wobble am ong any of the co mponents of the assem bly. Apply separator to the keys of the casts only.  Figure 7.28. Preparing the Cast and Jaw Relationship Record Assembly.  7.47.1.3.6. Position the upper cast by placing a thin rubber band around the incisal guide pin and both posts. Position the band on the pin’s lo wer mark and m ake the rem ainder of the band parallel to the horizontal plane of the artic ulator. Then use clay to position the cast and jaw relationship record assembly between the upper and lower mounting rings. 7.47.1.3.7. Make points A and B of the assembly fall on the plane of the rubber band (Figure 7.29). Point B represents the incisal edge of a maxillary central incisor, and two A points are places measured two-thirds of the way up the re tromolar pads on the right and left sides of the mandibular cast. 7.47.1.3.8. Center the upper cast under the upper m ounting ring. Use the incisal pin as a guide to center the midline mark of the maxillary occlusion rim. 7.47.1.3.9.

A facebow is a caliper-like device. By maxillary cast can be positioned on an articulator  in three dimensions the same way a patient’s upper jaw relates to the tem poromandibular joints. Mounting the m axillary cast is no longer dependent on an educated guess. Instead, it is based on an actual m easurement of the patient. With a facebow transfer, there is a m uch better chance the lateral contact relations developed between maxillary and m andibular teeth in the ar ticulator will show up the sam e as when the patient moves the mandible laterally. using the facebow transfer procedure, a 230  Figure 7.29. Positioning the Upper Cast. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  7.47.2.2. If the dentist determ ines the patient’s o cclusal vertical dim ension was incorrectly registered, a new centric relation occlusal vertical dimension record may not be necessary.  7.47.2.3. W hen a m axillary cast is m ounted with a facebow, it is possible to mincreases or decreases in the occlusal verticalrequiring a new jaw relationship record from  the  dentist. Denture teeth are then reset into positions that correspond with the adjusted occlusal vertical dimension. 7.47.2.4. Parts of the facebow assem bly include the bow, jack clamp, jackscrew, slide bars and locks, facebow fork, and orbital pointer (Figure 7.30). 7.47.2.5. Procedures for a facebow transfer are as follows: ake slight  dimension (± 2 m m) on the articulator without 7.47.2.5.1. The dentist heats the facebow fork and fuses it to the m axillary occlusion rim , orienting the plane of the fork parallel to the  plane of the wax rim . Any one of a num ber of methods can be used to locate the patient’s  condyles, and their positions are m arked on the surface of the skin. 7.47.2.5.2. The m axillary occlusion rim  with attach ed facebow fork is inserted into the patient’s m outh, and the facebow is placed over the patient’s face with the stem  on the facebow fork entering the jack clam p. The ends  of the slide bars are locked over the skin marks that indicate the location of the condyles.  The facebow fork is then locked together with the jack clam p, and the entire assem bly is removed from the patient as a unit (Figure 7.31-A). AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 7.30.

Before placing the facebow on the articulreadings (30 degrees horizontal condylar guidance, 15 degrees lateral condyle guidance, and 0 degrees incisal guidance). Make sure the centric locks are secured. In alm ost all cases the distance between the f acebow’s slide bars w ill not m atch the length of  the articulator’s condylar shaft. Also, the readings on the slide bar scales may or may not be the same. 7.47.2.5.4. Before trying to attach the bow assem bly to the articulator, m ake a note of the readings on the slide bar scales. Move the slide bars in or out by the sam e amount until the facebow springs gently over the ends of thjackscrew until the plane of the occlusion rim is parallel to the base of the articulator (Figure 7.31-C). 7.47.2.5.5. Index the maxillary cast and apply separator into the keys. Carefully seat the cast in the record base. The weight of the cast a nd the stone used to m ount it must be supported. To counteract this weight, support the occlusion rim with a cast-supporting device or clay. 7.47.2.5.6. Attach the cast to the upper mounting ring with a slurry accelerated mix of dental stone (Figure 7.31-D). Loosen the jack clam p  after the stone has reached final set, and remove the facebow from the articulator.

The value of using a remount procedure. A dentist uses a facebow tr ansfer with a third point of reference for a first (or original) articulation. Then, interocclus al records or a pantographic tracing is m ade to set the condylar guidance. If a clinical rem ount procedure is needed at som e later date after the castings or prosthesis is done, the de ntist makes another facebow transfer using the same third point. 232  Figure 7.31. Facebow Mounting of the Maxillary Cast (Hanau H2 Articulator). AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  7.47.2.5.8. The technician can use the sam e condylar settings that were used the first tim e. The dentist does not have to m ake new intero cclusal records or m ake a new pantographic tracing. The specific point of reference  used with the Hanau facebow is the  orbital pointer, but the Whip-Mix® uses a nasion relator. (See Chapter 1, Volume 2, of this pamphlet.). The Hanau H2 also has an attachment called the orbital plane indicator which corresponds to the orbital plane of the patient. 7.47.2.5.9. In addition to procedures in paragraphs 7.47.2.5.1 and 7.47.2.5.2, the dentist positions the tip of the orbital point at the patient’s orbitale. After the technician receives the facebow transfer, he or she places the facebow  on the articulator and adjusts the jackscrew until the tip of  the orbital pointer touches the  articulator’s orbital plane indicator (Figure 7.31-C). 7.48. Mounting the Mandibular Cast: 7.48.1. If the arbitrary (educated-guess) method was used to  mount the maxillary cast (paragraph 7.47.1), the mandibular cast is now part of a cast a nd jaw relationship record assem bly stabilized with coat hanger wires. 7.48.2. To m ount the m andibular cast, invert the ar ticulator, using a stand if necessary (Figure 7.32). Be certain the condylar elements are locked against the centric stops. Remove the clay from between the base of the m andibular cast and mandibular cast. Attach the m andibular cast to th e lower mounting ring with a slurry accelerated the m ounting ring. Moisten the base of the AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  233 mix of dental stone.  The incisal guide pin must be in contact with the incisal guide table after the mounting is complete. Smooth the mounting with wet/dry sandpaper, and clean up the articulator.  Figure 7.32. Mounting the Mandibular Cast.   7.48.3. If  the facebow transfer method is used, the m axillary cast should first be attached to the maxillary m ounting ring according to directions in paragraphs 7.47.2.5.3 through 7.47.2.5.6. y. Be certain the condylar elem ents are locked Invert the articulator using a stand if necessaragainst the centric stops. Seat the centric relati on and occlusal vertical dim ension record on the maxillary cast and spot-lute the record base to the cast. Seat the m andibular cast in the mandibular record base and spot-lute to the record base. Make  absolutely sure the occlusion rims are properly oriented one to another. Reinforce the assem bly  with coat hanger wires. Adjust the top of the incisal guide pin flush with the top surface of the articulator.  7.48.4. Apply separator to the cast index keys, m oisten the base slightly, and use dental stone to attach the cast to the m ounting ring.  Before the stone reaches its initial set, check to see that the incisal  guide  pin  is  contacting  the  incisal  guide  table. Sm ooth the m ounting and m ake the articulator presentable. 234  Section 7J—Hanau H2 Articulator Settings in Complete Denture Construction 7.49. Using the Hanau H2 as a Fixed Guide Instrument (Arbitrary, Average, or Educated-Guess Method): AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 7.49.1. Mount the maxillary cast in an average manner according to paragraph 7.47.1. 7.49.2. Set the horizontal condylar guidances at 30 degrees on the horizontal scale. 7.49.3. Rotate the posts to 15 degrees on the lateral condylar indication scale. 7.49.4. During cast mounting procedures, set the incisal guide table at 0 degrees. The setting of the incisal guide table changes with the kind of com plete denture being m ade; for example, balanced complete dentures versus the m onoplane variet y. The use of the incisal guide table will be explained as part of the directions for the type of case being done. 7.50. Using the Semiadjustable Capabilities of the Hanau H2: 7.50.1. Facebow Transfer. Mount the maxillary cast by the facebow transfer method described in paragraphs 7.47.2.5.3 through 7.47.2.5.6.  7.50.2. Adjustment of Horizontal Condylar Guidance: 7.50.2.1. After the m andibular cast is m ounted usi ng the usual centric relation and occlusal vertical dimension record, set the horizontal condylar guidances with a separate,  protrusive jaw relationship record or checkbite (Figure 7.33). This checkbite is used to transfer the angulation of a person’s eminence, as it exists in the skull,  to the articulator. A protrusive checkbite gives this relationship with an accuracy of ± 5 degrees.  7.50.2.2. The dentist places the m axillary and m andibular record bases with occlusion rim s in the patient’s m outh, and m akes a record of a pr otrusive occlusal relationship. The technician then prepares the articulator to receive this r ecord. The technician will raise the incisal pin out of contact with the incisal guide table, loosen the centric locks, loosen the thum b nuts f or the horizontal condylar guide inclinations, and set th e lateral rotation of the condylar posts at 15 degrees. Unscrew the m ounted maxillary cast from  the upper m ember. Separate the cast from  the m ounting stone in a way that m aintains  the m ounting, the keys, and the cast intact. Separation should not present a problem if separator was applied to the cast before mounting.  7.50.2.3. Position the protrusive jaw relationship record on the lower cast and spot-lute the record base in place. Put the upper cast in its r ecord base and do the same. Reinforce the entire assembly with coat hanger wires. Screw the  maxillary cast’s m ounting back onto the upper member. Move the upper m ember of the articul ator to a place where the m ounting stone and the base of the maxillary cast seem to fit together best.  7.50.2.4. To adjust the right and left horizontal c ondylar guidances, rotate the guides back and forth in their housings. Carefully hunt for settings where the stone mounting and the base of the cast f it together  perfectly. Tighten the condylar guide inclination thum bnuts to preserve the adjustments. Record the settings. Rem ove the  protrusive record. The form al nam e for the method used to m ake the horizontal  condylar guidance adjustm ent is the  split cast technique. NOTE: Adjustment of the horizontal condylar guidance using a protrusive record is often done after receiving the wax trial dentur e or during a clinical rem ount procedure. If this is the case, refer to the procedures in Chapter 1, Volum e 2,  of this pam phlet for a description of that technique.  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 7.33.

In fact, there are thousands of possible com binations.  NOTE: Denture teeth m ay be stocked in varieties and 236  quantities appropriate to local usage. A denture tooth stock management system should be established to order and stock the teeth. For information about this system, see Attachment 4.  Figure 7.34.

Denture teeth are com mercially available in  m axillary anterior, m andibular anterior, maxillary posterior, or mandibular posterior matched sets made from porcelain or plastic. Anterior tooth sets consist of six teeth and are known as “1  x 6s.” Posterior tooth sets are called “1 x 8s” (Figures 7.36 and 7.37). 7.52.2. Differences in shape, size, and color (am ong other characteristics) m ake the sets distinct from one another. A full com plement of denture  teeth contains 28 teeth because third m olars are not used in the fabrication of complete and RPDs. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 7.36.

Porcelain is an inert m aterial that does not chem ically bond to acrylic resin. Therefore, m echanical retention in the form  of pins or undercut holes (diatorics) is necessary to retain porcelain teeth in a denture base. If there is very little room  between th e arches of a com plete denture setup, a slightly oversize porcelain tooth m ight be  ground to fit the space. However, care m ust be taken because a porcelain tooth is ruined the instant the m echanical retention is cut away. The following design features are associated with porcelain teeth (Figure 7.38):  238  Figure 7.38. Design Features of Artificial Teeth. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  nture tooth. Som etimes a part of the collar is 7.53.1. Collar. The collar is that area on the facial side of  a denture tooth, about 1 m m wide, that extends from the gingival edge to the groove acro ss the facial surface. The collar is em bedded in the plastic denture base. It helps retain the deintentionally left uncovered to simulate the root surface of a tooth. 7.53.2. Neck. The neck  of a denture tooth is the bulge on the facial side, that is just incisal or occlusal to the collar and its limiting groove. 7.53.3. Bite. The bite is the lingual surface of an anterior denture tooth. 7.53.4. Pins. Porcelain teeth do not bond to a  plastic denture base. Porcelain  anterior teeth have pins that keep the teeth seated in the base material. 7.53.5. Shut. The shut is that portion of the lingual surface of an anterior porcelain denture tooth where the pins are located. There are no shuts or pins on acrylic resin denture teeth. 7.53.6. Ridgelap. The ridgelap is that portion of the denture toot h between the shut and the collar that laps over the ridge of the cast. 7.53.7. Diatoric. A diatoric is a hole located in the ridgelap of a  posterior porcelain denture tooth that serves to hold the tooth to the denture base. Additional retention is obtained through vent holes, that extend from the diatoric to the mesial and distal surfaces of the porcelain denture tooth. 7.53.8. Lingual Finish Line. The lingual line of union between the tooth and the denture base is  the lingual finish line. 7.53.9. Identification Marks. Identifying marks are found on the mesial portion of the ridgelap of each posterior tooth. One raised dot identifies a firs t premolar or a first molar; two dots indicate a second premolar or second molar (Figure 7.39). 7.54.  Design  Features  of  Plastic  Denture  Teeth. Plastic denture teeth are retained within a denture base because the tooth and the denture base m aterial bond together chem ically. Ordinarily, there is no need for m echanical retention, but som e of the  newer filled resin plastic  teeth do not bond well and require chemical treatment or diatorics. The design features of porcelain and plastic teeth are essentially the same except for the following differences: 7.54.1. A plastic anterior tooth does not have a shut or pins. 7.54.2. The extent of the ridgelap on a plastic anridgelap carries over to the lingual finish line area. 7.54.3. Resin posterior denture teeth do not have diatorics. terior tooth is not lim ited by the shut.

Porcelain: 7.55.1.1. Porcelain teeth are m ore lifelike in appearance than plastic teeth. They are m ore stain and wear resistant and are unaffected by solvents. 7.55.1.2. On the other hand, porcelain denture teetConsequently, porcelain teeth are rarely used to  oppose natural teeth. Another problem  is that porcelain teeth are prone to fracture on im pact. If the occlusal vertical dim ension is excessive, opposing porcelain denture teeth m ay contact a nd “click” when the patient talks. Also, porcelain teeth cannot be custom ground for a space that is any smaller than leaving the pins or diatoric intact allows. h abrades the natural tooth structure. 7.55.2. Plastic: 7.55.2.1. Although plastic teeth (when com pared to  porcelain counterparts) are less lifelike, less stain and wear resistant, and m ore likely  to be dam aged by solvents, plastic teeth have highly significant advantages. They can be safely ground to fit sm all spaces because the shearing strength of plastic in thin sections is  much higher than porcelain. Also, som e plastic teeth chem ically unite with a denture base, mechanical retention. 7.55.2.2. Plastic does not abrade enam el and it is th e material of choice for denture teeth that oppose natural teeth. Further, when plastic teeth contact each other, they make almost no sound and are much less likely to chip or shatter than porcelain. and there are no worries about grinding away 7.55.3. Combination of Porcelain and Plastic Teeth in Complete Denture Setups. There is no objection to using  plastic anterior denture teeth and  porcelain posterior teeth in a m axillary and mandibular complete denture setup, but using  porcelain anterior teeth and  plastic posterior teeth is not recom mended. Because plastic abrades faster  than porcelain, the patient has a tendency to develop prem ature contacts between upper and lo wer anterior teeth. This condition is highly destructive to anterior residual ridges. 7.56. Esthetic Factors in Selecting Anterior Denture Teeth: 7.56.1. The primary factor in selecting anterior dentur e teeth is the esthetic  effect of the patient’s total image. It is vitally important to match the size, shape, color, and arrangement of denture teeth to a person’s anatomical measurements, face form, sexual characteristics, and age. 240  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  the patient’s original tooth shapes and have these types of casts in their possession, 7.56.2. Pre-extraction records are excellent guides toarrangement. The best kind of record is a plaster cas t of the patient’s dental arch m ade before the teeth were extracted. Although very few patients most can provide a full-face photograph showing their natural teeth.   in 7.56.3. In the absence of pre-extraction records, dentists and technicians categorize patientsvarious ways. Selecting, modifying, and arranging denture teeth are dictated by what usually holds true for the category of person. Selecting denture teeth for esthetic value centers around choosing the set’s general size, shape, and color. 7.56.4.  Modification  means making personalized alterations to  the size, shape, and color of the arrangement  means positioning teeth in a pleasing, functional teeth in the set. Denture tooth manner. Modification and arrangement considerations appear in paragraph 7.73. 7.56.5. See paragraphs 7.57 through 7.59 for an outline of  the principles associated with selecting and ordering a set of anterior denture teeth for esthetic value. 7.57. Selecting Maxillary Anterior Denture Teeth: 7.57.1.  Size. Denture tooth  size  is a com bination of facial length and width (Figure 7.40). To estimate the m axillary central incisor length, m easure the occlusion rim  between the occlusal plane and the high lip line. To find the collective width of the six maxillary anterior teeth, measure the distance between the canine lines and add 8 mm.  Figure 7.40. Selecting the Size of Maxillary Anterior Teeth.  7.57.2. Shape (Mold). Research has shown that an inverted m axillary incisor tooth has roughly the sam e shape as the person’s face, both in approximates the shape of a patient’s face looks good in that person’s mouth. In profile, individuals have either flat or convex  surfaces. Viewing people’s faces frontally,  four basic face forms and  three  subgroups  have been defined in Figure 7.41 and the following subparagraphs: (NOTE: This figure was adapted from  material presented in  A Portfolio on Prosthetics, Dentsply International Inc, York PA.) the profile and frontal view. A tooth that 7.57.2.1.  Square. In this basic form , the sides of th e cranium , the condylar areas, and the angles of the mandible fall on more or less straight, roughly parallel lines. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 7.41. Typical Face Forms. 241  7.57.2.2. Square Ovoid. In this subgroup of the square form , the character of the square tooth is softened (rounder incisal corners and line angles) which m akes it a m ore fem inine tooth form. 7.57.2.3. Tapering. In this basic form , the tapering face is  widest at the height of the sides of the cranium. The sides of the cranium , the condyl ar areas, and the angles of the m andible fall on more or less straight, converging lines. 7.57.2.4. Tapering Ovoid. In this subgroup of the tapering form , the tapering tooth is softened by a more rounded appearance, which makes it a more feminine tooth form. 7.57.2.5.  Square  Tapering. In this basic f orm, the sides of  the head are parallel fcondylar areas upward. The facial outline tapers condyles downward. 7.57.2.6.  Square  Tapering  Ovoid.  In this subgroup of the square tapering form , the square tapering tooth is softened by a more rounded appearance, which makes it a more feminine tooth form. 7.57.2.7. Ovoid. In this basic form , the ovoid face is  widest through the level of the condyles. The facial outlines curve inward above and below to form an oval. There is no subgroup for the basic, ovoid form. 7.57.2.8. Different Forms for Men and Women. The square, tapering, and square tapering face forms are highly angular and are usually asso ciated with males. Subgroups are softer, less angular versions of their basic groups and are m ore feminine in nature. On the other hand, the basic, ovoid form  m ay be characteristic of e ither a m an or a wom an. Each basic group and rom the toward the angles of the m andible from the 242  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 subgroup has a specific denture tooth m old associated with it. A dentist who believes in these theories makes a face form analysis and picks tooth shapes with  basic forms for men and tooth shapes with subgroup or ovoid forms for women. 7.57.3. Color (Shade). Teeth are blends of grays and yellows, but traces of other colors will m ost likely be present. Color choice is  mainly a function of the patient’s age. Natural teeth absorb food and tobacco stains as people get older. Teeth tend to get darker with advancing years. One sure way to create a false-looking denture is to use ve ry light teeth for an older person. An argum ent can be m ade for selecting light colored teeth would probably look unsightly. However, there is no justification for routinely choosing dark teeth for people with black hair and dark skins. A m an’s teeth might be a shade darker than a wom an’s teeth of the same age, but this is only a guide and is not universally true. for fair skinned, blond people because dark teeth 7.58. Ordering Anterior Maxillary Denture Teeth. Each m anufacturer publishes a tooth m old chart that presents pictures of available shapes along with  a statement of their sizes. The face form analysis of the patient helps develop a firm idea of the needs of the patient in terms of anterior tooth size, shape, and color. To order denture teeth, obtain the m anufacturer’s code f or the set of  maxillary anterior denture teeth that best fits the size and shape specifications. Then identif y the tooth color appropriate f or the patient on the manufacturer’s shade guide. 7.59.  Selecting  Mandibular  Anterior  Denture  Teeth. The m old chart indicates the m andibular anterior tooth size and shape that goes well with the  chosen maxillary anterior tooth m old. However, a mold chart is only a guide. For exam ple, a Class II  or Class III case could dictate a step up or down in size, while shape and color remain constant. 7.60.  Functional  and  Esthetic  Factors  in  Selecting  Posterior  Denture  Teeth. The em phasis in ifts f rom esthetics to f unction.  Esthetics  is still im portant, but selecting posterior denture teeth shfunction is more important when selecting posterior  denture teeth. The choice between porcelain and plastic posterior teeth as well as tooth shape (mold) is the dentist’s decision. Size can be the technician’s choice. 7.60.1. Posterior Denture Tooth Size. Size factors considered are crown height and m esiodistal length. For practical purposes, the distance between measured to get an estim ate of proper posterior tooth height. The com bined mesiodistal length of the first prem olar through the second m olar is de termined by m easuring the m illimeter distance from the distal of  the m axillary canine denture tooth to the front of the m axillary tuberosity on both sides. The lower number is used. 7.60.2.  Posterior  Denture  Tooth  Shape  (Mold). Posterior denture tooth shape  refers to the presence or absence of cusps (Figure 7.42). The  common denture tooth cusp angles are 33, 30, 20, and 0 degrees as follows: the record base and the occlusal plane is 7.60.2.1. The 33- and 30-Degree Denture Teeth (Anatomic). These posterior denture teeth look more natural in a patient’s m outh and seem  to have m ore chewing efficiency than teeth with smaller cusp angles. Com plete dentures  with anatomic denture teeth are m ore commonly made for patients with good residual ridges becaudisplaced when the m andible moves into lateral  excursions. Residual ridges m ust have at least moderate vertical height to oppose this tendency. se these dentures have a tendency to be  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 7.42. Denture Tooth Cusp Angles. 243  7.60.2.2. The 20-Degree Posterior Denture Teeth (Semianatomic). The 20-degree posterior denture teeth enjoy a great deal of popularity. Th ey cause less lateral, denture displacing force than 30-degree teeth and have better esthetics than 0-degree teeth. 7.60.2.3.  The  0-Degrees  Denture  Teeth  (Nonanatomic). These denture teeth have no cusp inclines; and they are supplied in porcelain, plastic, or plastic with m etal inserts. They are rarely used in cases that require articulation w ith natural teeth. The 0-degree teeth are favored in cases where the patients have poor muscle coordination or poor ridges or when the ridges are in crossbite. 7.60.3. Posterior Denture Tooth Color (Shade). Because natural posterior teeth are darker than the anterior teeth in the m ouths of m ost people, the dentist tends to choose a posterior denture tooth color that is one shade darker than the anterior shade selected. 7.61. Manufacturer’s Coding of Posterior Teeth (1 x 8 Sets): 7.61.1. After the dentist selects a shade, the shape and size of the posterior teeth are chosen from a manufacturer’s mold guide. A set of 1 x 8s has shade and m old codes printed on the m ounting card. Most manufacturers use their own unique codes. 7.61.2. One m anufacturer uses a num ber and a letter  to code posterior tooth m olds. The num ber refers to the tooth m esiodistal length in m illimeters of the f our maxillary posterior teeth of  one side. The letter refers to their relative occlusogingival height (“S” for short, “M” for m edium, and “L” for long). Short teeth measure about 7 to 8.5 mm. 7.61.3. As an exam ple, a m old labeled “30L” woul d be a m axillary posterior set whose overall mesiodistal width of the four teeth on one side is 30 mm and whose individual teeth are more than 10 mm in length. Mandibular posterior  denture teeth interdigitate only with m axillary posterior denture teeth of the sam e mold number; but they  can be set against dentur e teeth of a different length. Thus, 30L maxillary posterior denture teeth occlude perfectly with 30S or 30M mandibular posterior denture teeth, but they do not  occlude with 32L or 34L m old teeth.  NOTE: Although number and letter codes have not been standardized, conversion charts are available.  Section 7L—Denture Tooth Arrangement (General) 7.62. Responsibilities and Objectives. It is the dentist’s responsibility to get the proper jaw relationship records and accurate m easurements in the patient’s m outh. The technician m akes sure the arrangem ent (positioning) of the denture teeth harm onizes with  these lim iting factors. There are at least three objectives in setting or arranging denture teeth. The  first is to achieve the m aximum chewing f unction and stability, the second is to avoid any interference w ith the patient’s speech, and the third is to restore the natural appearance.  244  7.63. Gross Alignment of Anterior Denture Teeth: AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 7.63.1. The technician establishes a perm anent midline reference by extending the m idline mark on the maxillary occlusion rim onto the base of  the maxillary cast. The m axillary central incisors are set on each side of this midline mark which corresponds to the middle of the patient’s face. 7.63.2. The dentist has previously shaped the labial  contour of the occlusion rim  to give adequate support to the patient’s lips. The dentist adjusted the anterior portion of the occlusal plane (also called the incisal plane) to expose about 1 m m of occlusion rim wax when the patient’s lips were in a relaxed state. This is because the edges of the central incisors are normally visible when facial muscles are at rest. Due to progressive wear of natural dentition, m ore edge shows in the very young patient and less or no edge is visible in older patients. Finally, the dentist oriented the incisal plane parallel to an imaginary line drawn between the pupils of the patient’s eyes. 7.63.3. After the dentist’s efforts, the technician positions the labial surfaces of the m axillary anterior denture teeth on the occlusion rim ’s la bial surface. The edges of m ost of the upper anterior teeth are set to touch the occlusal plane as developed by the dentist (Figure 7.43). The technician positions the m andibular central inci sors on each side of the midline, and the mandibular anterior teeth should follow the labial shape of the mandibular occlusion rim.  Figure 7.43. Set Anterior Denture Teeth To Match Occlusion Rim Contours.  ple, vertical overlap usually ime m onoplane dentures that use 0-degree 7.63.4. The esthetic and functional requirem ents of the denture occlusion being organized dictate the horizontal and vertical overlaps. For examproves the appearance of a denture, but anterior teeth in somposteriors do not overlap vertically. Vertical ove rlap in a m onoplane denture tends to reduce the denture’s stability in lateral and protrusive occlusion. 7.63.5. The labial surfaces of m andibular anterior de nture teeth conform  to  the labial contour of the occlusion rim . ( EXCEPTION: The facial surfaces of lower anterior teeth m ust not be positioned further labially than a line extending fr om the depth of the m andibular labial sulcus, which is also perpendicular to the occlusal plan e [Figure 7.44].) Lower anterior teeth that are set forward of this line could be responsible for gross denture instability. 7.63.6. This guideline is m ost frequently violated  when dentures are m ade for a patient with a t or technician m istakenly tries to produce Class II (retrognathic) jaw relationship. The dentisdentures with a horizontal overlap that is characteristic of a Class I (norm al) case. In Class II cases, enough horizontal overlap m ust be used to  properly relate the lower incisors to the mandibular labial sulcus. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  245 7.63.7. If contoured occlusion rim s are not availabl e to assist placem ent of anterior teeth, follow purely anatom ical guidelines as a last resort. However, there is no assurance that com plete reliance on these guidelines will yield an acceptable esthetic result.  Figure 7.44. Maximum Labial Placement of Lower Anterior Teeth.  7.63.8. If using anatom ic guides, the incisive papilla  is an excellent guide to the m idline of the face. However, the m axillary labial frenum  should  not be used for such an estim ate because it is unreliable. 7.63.9. Next, determine the position of the occlusal pl ane. The posterior edge of the plane should be located two-thirds of the way up the retrom olar pad on both sides of the arch. Anteriorly, the plane is oriented equidistant between the upper and lower ridges, and the m easurement is made in the midline. The edges of  the m axillary central inci sors and canines are set to contact this plane. The labial faces of the m axillary anterior teeth  are made to fall on a line dropped vertically from  the depth of the labial sulcus, and perpendicular to the occlusal plane. In sim ilar fashion, the mandibular labial sulcus is used as a guide to position the mandibular anterior teeth. 7.64. Gross Alignment of Posterior Denture Teeth. In the anterior area, occlusion rim  features almost always take precedence over anatom ical landmarks as guides for setting teeth. W hen setting posterior teeth, the relative im portance of intraoral anatom ical guides increases because these guides have a very high level of reliability. If the posterior areas of occlusion rims are not fully contoured, posterior denture teeth can be confidently positioned by using key anatom ical features as references. Be very suspicious of occlusion rim  contours in posterior areas that deviate from  intraoral anatom ical guides. W hen questions arise, confer with the dentist. 7.64.1. Identifying Anatomical Guidelines on the Cast. On both sides, m ark the projection of the following anatomical landmarks on the land area of the cast where they can be seen: 7.64.1.1. On the maxillary cast, the anterior borders of the maxillary tuberosities (Figure 7.45). 7.64.1.2. On the mandibular cast, point “A” depicting the anterior border of the retrom olar pad and point “B” depicting the lingual border of mandibular cast, point “C” depicting a point retromolar pad which is measured from its anterior border. the retrom olar pad (Figure 7.46). Also on the two-thirds of  the wa y up the length of the 246  Figure 7.45. Maxillary Tuberosity Projection. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 7.46. Mandibular Cast Landmarks.  s that define a line over the crest of the 7.64.1.3. Mark the anterior and the posterior pointmandibular residual ridge (Figure 7.46, points “D” and “E”). This line passes through the canine region anteriorly, and the retrom olar  pad, posteriorly. Using points “D” and “E” as references, transfer this line to the occlusal surface of the mandibular wax rim (Figure 7.47). 7.64.2. Crests of the Residual Ridges. The crests of residual ridges are reliable for buccolingual positioning of posterior denture teeth as long as resorption is slight to m oderate. Reliability decreases as the amount of resorption increases (Figure 7.48): 7.64.2.1. Mandibular Residual Ridges: 7.64.2.1.1. There is less support for a denture in the m andibular arch than for a denture located on the m axillary arch. The m axillary  denture can take advantage of the support provided by the palate, which bears som e of  the chewing load. Mandibular ridges that support complete dentures can be expected to resorb faster than maxillary ridges. 7.64.2.1.2. One m ethod used to keep resorption to a m inimum is positioning m andibular posterior denture teeth as ideally as possible.  Therefore, as a guideline for setting posterior denture teeth, the crest of the ridge in the mandibular arch takes precedence over the crest of AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  247 the ridge in the m axillary arch. W hen resorption is slight to m oderate, position the buccal cusps of mandibular posterior denture teeth over the crest of the mandibular ridge. 7.64.2.1.3. In m any cases, m axillary posterior teeth  are set before the m andibular posterior teeth. The central grooves of the m axillary t eeth m ust be centered over the crest of the mandibular ridge (occlusion rim  line) so the  buccal cusps of the m andibular teeth fall over the crest of the mandibular ridge when the denture teeth contact in centric occlusion; that is, buccal cusps of the m andibular teeth in the fo ssae and em brasures of the m axillary teeth (Figure 7.49).  Figure 7.47. Crest of the Mandibular Ridge Marked on the Occlusion Rim.  Figure 7.48. Edentulous Ridge Resorption Patterns.  7.64.3. Maxillary Residual Ridges: 7.64.3.1. The buccolingual positioning of posterior denture teeth in the maxillary arch is largely dictated by the m ost favorable position for poste rior denture teeth in the m andibular arch. When following this rule, the m axillary posterior denture teeth will be m ore or less centered over the crests of the m axillary ridges. B ecause m andibular ridges resorb downward and outward (Figure 7.48), m axillary posterior de nture teeth are rarely placed too far when a technician sets them; the tendency is to place them too far buccally. 7.64.3.2. The buccal surfaces of m axillary posterior denture teeth must not be placed any m ore buccally than a line perpendicular to the occlussulcus. If ideal positioning of m andibular poste rior denture teeth forces placem ent of the maxillary posterior teeth m ore to the buccal than the rule allows, then it is not a normally al plane drawn into the depth of the buccal lingually 248  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 Figure 7.49. Mandibular Residual Ridge as a Landmark for Setting Teeth. related case. Under these circum stances, set de nture teeth in crossbite (Section 7P). A good indicator of a possible crossbite situation is wh en the arch of the m andibular residual ridge is much larger than its maxillary counterpart. 7.64.3.3. Although the tuberosities are the m ost distal  features of the m axillary edentulous ridge and are technically a part of m axillary posterior denture teeth extend on to the tuberoposterior tooth from the setup. First premolars are the teeth usually omitted.   it, denture  teeth are not set on tuberosities. Ifsities, select a sm aller size tooth or drop a   7.64.4. Retromolar Pad. The retromolar pad: 7.64.4.1. Is a guide to the com bined anteroposterior length of the mandibular posteriors on one side. Denture teeth m ust never be set on a retromolar pad. If the com bined anteroposterior length of a posterior mold is too great, either choose another size or drop a posterior tooth from the setup. 7.64.4.2. Can become a guide to the buccolingual pos ition of the m andibular posteriors. If the mandibular residual ridge is virtually gone and it becom es unreliable as a guide for setting mandibular posterior teeth, the lingual cusps of the mandibular posterior teeth should lie within a triangle form ed by the buccal and lingual boundari es of the retrom olar pad and the m esial surface of the mandibular canine (Figure 7.50). 7.64.4.3. Is a guide to the superior-inferior positioning of the occlusal plane within the interarch space. The occlusal plane of a natural dentition pr ojected from the anterior hits the retrom olar pads posteriorly about two-thirds of the way  up their length (Figure 7.51). Try to im itate this condition in com plete denture construction. The o cclusal plane is established by the first arch set. To establish the occlusal plane, position th e anterior teeth to m atch the occlusion rim  and use a flat metal plate to help position the posteriors (Figures 7.52, 7.53, and 7.54). AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure  7.50.  Retromolar  Pad  as  a  Landmark  for  Buccolingual  Positioning  of  Mandibular Posterior Denture Teeth. 249  Figure 7.51. Relationship of the Retromolar Pad to the Natural Dentition.  7.65.  Sequence  of  Arranging  Denture  Teeth. W hen individually arranging denture teeth in a systematic, regular sequence, the results are consistently better. One of the following sequences should be used: 7.65.1.  Sequence  #1  (Most  Popular). One of the m ost popular, this sequence uses m axillary anterior teeth f irst and then the m axillary  posterior, m andibular posteriors, and m andibular anterior teeth as follows: 7.65.1.1. Set the two m axillary central incisors firs t and then the lateral incisor and canine on one side. The lateral incisor and canine on the opposite side complete maxillary anterior setup. 7.65.1.2. Place the maxillary first premolar, second premolar, first molar, and second molar on one side. Repeat the sam e sequence for the oppos ite side. Set m axillary posteriors against the top of a metal template (Figure 7.52). 7.65.1.3. Place the m andibular posterior denture teet h (except the prem olars) in the following order: first, set the two first m olars, bila terally, next, position the second m olar and second premolar on one side, and then position the second m olar and second prem olar on the other side. 250  Figure 7.52. Use of a Flat Template (Sequence #1). AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  7.65.1.4. Place the mandibular anterior denture teeth in the same order as the maxillary anterior denture teeth. 7.65.1.5. Position the mandibular first premolar denture teeth last. 7.65.2.  Sequence  #2  (Used  For  0-Degree  Monoplane  and  20-Degree  Balanced  Occlusion). This sequence is com monly used for setting 0-degree posterior in m onoplane occlusions and occasionally used for setting 20-degree posteriors in  balanced occlusions. In this sequence, set the maxillary anterior teeth f irst and then m andibular anterior teeth. A f lat metal plate establishes the occlusal plane in m onoplane occlusions (Figur e 7.53) and a curved 20-degree plate forms a compensating curve for balanced occlusions (F igure 7.54). Set m andibular denture teeth against the undersurface of the approximate metal template. Set the maxillary posteriors last. 7.65.3. Sequence #3 (Alternate Method). This sequence is m axillary anterior teeth, m andibular anterior teeth, maxillary posteriors, and mandibular posteriors. 7.65.4. Additional Guidance for Sequences. Some dentists set m axillary anterior denture teeth on the occlusion rim in the patient’s mouth as a first step toward composing a complete setup. For all practical purposes, the rest of the arrangem ent is done on an articulator. In such situations, it is reasonable to follow arrangem ent sequence #1. A few dentists set the m axillary and m andibular anterior teeth while the patient is present. Depending on the dentist’s wishes, either sequence #2 or #3 will apply. 7.66.  Compensation  for  a  Lack  of  Interarch  Space. It is com mon for interarch space to be at a premium in complete denture construction. One solution  is to use plastic denture teeth. If that does not help enough, cut out the interfering part of the record  base, adapt a piece of tin foil to the cast slightly larger than the cut out area, and set the record base on the cast over the foil. Try to make as conservative a hole in the record base as possible. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 7.53. Use of a Flat Plate for Monoplane Occlusions (Sequence #2). 251  Figure 7.54.

The term  “silver-dollar” setup originated when technicians who prided them selves on their speed rapidly ali gned the incisal edges of upper anterior teeth to match the rim of a silver dollar. 252  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 7.67.2. Another characteristic of the basic arrangemmaxillary anterior teeth are m irror images of each other from  right to left side (Figure 7.55). This arrangement could represent an 18-year-old person who has perfectly formed teeth in ideal alignment. The arrangem ent is certainly possible,  but it is alm ost too good to be true. W hen it is placed in the m outh of an average com plete-denture patient who is 35 years or older, the silver-dollar setup stands out as false. ent is that the axial inclinations of the  Figure 7.55.

The guides and procedures f or aligning the m axillary anterior teeth are as follows: incisal edge contacts the incisal plane. This 7.68.1. Central Incisor. Cut out a block of wax large enough  to accommodate the central incisor and seat the tooth in soft wax (Figure 7.56). Po sition the m esial surface on the m idline. Position the tooth so the full m esiodistal width of the automatically tilts the long axis to the distal sligh tly, the neck of the tooth is som ewhat depressed, and the incisal and middle thirds of the labial face are flush with the labial contour of the wax rim. Secure the tooth in place by flowing a sm all amount of m olten wax around it. Position the other incisor in the same way. 7.68.2. Lateral Incisor. Prepare a cutout for the lateral inci sor and place it in a bed of soft wax (Figure 7.57). Set the long axis of the lateral at an angle that is m ore distal to the perpendicular than the central. The incisal edge should be about  1 mm above the incisal plane. The neck should be more depressed than the neck of the central in cisor. The incisal third should be flush with the labial contour of the wax rim. Seal the tooth in place. 7.68.3. Canine. The incisal tip of the canine rests on axis is cocked m ore distal to the perpendicular lateral incisor. From  a labiolingual point of view , the long axis is vertically oriented and the middle third of the labial surface is  flush with the wax rim. The canine tooth is located at a corner of the dental arch. In keeping with its position, the canine has two definite planes on its labial face, a mesial plane and a distal plane. Align the m esial plane to follow the curve of the anterior teeth. Align the distal plane with the posterior teetopposite side and be sure to follow the contour of the occlusion rim (Figure 7.59). the occlusal plane (Figure 7.58).

Maxillary Central Incisor. 253  7.69. “Basic” Arrangement (Mandibular): 7.69.1. When a standardized m andibular tooth arrangement is used, the teeth are positioned on or are slightly facial to the m andibular ridge. If th ey are lingual to the ridge, they encroach on the space the tongue norm ally occupies. If they are too  far facial to the ridge, the lower lip presses against them, and adverse leverages will tend to dislodge the denture. 7.69.2. The distance the m axillary anterior teeth ex tend over the m andibular anterior teeth in a vertical direction is the vertical overlap. The  distance the maxillary anterior teeth project beyond the m andibular anterior teeth in a horizontal diWhen teeth are in centric occlusion, the angle between the incisal edges of the upper and lower central incisors is the incisal guide angle.  7.69.3. Horizontal and vertical overlap varies (balanced versus m onoplane), the posterior tooth  mold used (20 degrees versus 30 degrees), and the tooth arrangem ent sequence em ployed. This pa mphlet explains the details of a num ber of different com plete denture occlusions. A suggest ed tooth sequence and specific directions for setting overlaps are given with the complete denture occlusion being described. rection is the horizontal overlap (Figure 7.60). formed with the occlusal plane by a line drawn with the kind of occlusion being organized 254  Figure 7.57. Maxillary Lateral Incisor. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  7.70. Guides and Procedures. The guides and procedures for aligning the mandibular anterior teeth are described much like the maxillary anterior teeth. 7.71. Arch Form and Axial Inclination. The basic, uncharacterized arch  form and axial inclination of  mandibular anterior denture teeth are shown in Figure 7.61 and as follows:  7.71.1. Central Incisor: 7.71.1.1. The labiolingual inclination is slightly depressed at the neck.  7.71.1.2. The mesiodistal inclination is perpendicular to the occlusal plane.  7.71.1.3. The arch alignment is on the curve of the arch (occlusion rim). 7.71.2. Lateral Incisor: 7.71.2.1. The labiolingual inclination is perpendicular to the occlusal plane. 7.71.2.2. The mesiodistal inclination is a slight disal inclination. 7.71.2.3. The arch alignment is on the curve of the arch (occlusion rim). 7.71.3. Canine: AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  255 7.71.3.1. The labiolingual inclination is inclined. 7.71.3.2. The mesiodistal inclination is more distally inclined than the lateral incisor. 7.71.3.3. In the arch alignm ent, the m esial half of  the labial face conform s to the curve of the arch initiated by the incisors. The distal half of the labial surface is angled to m atch the posterior buccal alignm ent.  NOTE:  The two central incisors are us ually set f irst, the lateral incisor and canine on a side are set next, and the lateral incisor and canine on the opposite side complete the setup.  Figure 7.58. Maxillary Canine.  7.72.  Characterizing  Anterior  Denture  Teeth. Characterization is an attem pt to coordinate the appearance of the prosthesis with the patient’s an atomical measurements, face form, sex, and age. Race is also a consideration when choosing the color of a denture base material. 7.73. Modifying a Tooth’s Basic Shape (Mold). The teeth in a set can be ground to produce special effects used for custom izing denture tooth arrangem ents. The objective of characterized arrangem ent is to harmonize the appearance of the denture teeth with  the unique features of the patient and existing dentition, as follows: 7.73.1. Sex. The m esial and distal corners of the m axillary incisors can be rounded to produce a more feminine appearance. 256  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 7.73.2. Age. Natural teeth wear down at varying rates as  people grow older. One characteristic of age is that the incisal edge of the m axillary la teral incisor touches the occlusal plane. Besides setting the maxillary lateral incisor in this manner, grind the edges of the anterior teeth to simulate wear that is appropriate for the person’s age.  Men usually show m ore wear than wom en of the same age. When grinding the teeth, it is not necessary to grind all of them and no two teeth should be ground in exactly the same way.  Figure 7.59. Completed Maxillary Anterior Setup.   7.74. Organizing a Unique Set of Anterior Teeth Using Size, Shape, and Color Combinations from Different Sets: 7.74.1. Size. Wide maxillary lateral incisors are generally thought to be a masculine characteristic. Small, narrow lateral incisors are associated with femininity. 7.74.2.  Shape. Square, angular m olds are associated  with m asculinity. The ovoid form s are suppose to suggest femininity. 7.74.3.  Color  (Shade). Marked differences in color am ong anterior teeth are com mon in older people. 7.75. Composing a Suitable Arrangement. Arrangement is the manner in which the teeth of a denture relate to the residual ridge and to other teeth within  the denture base. Some types of arrangements are as follows: 7.75.1.  Basic  Arrangement. This is the classical silver-dollar setup which has already been AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  257 discussed in detail (paragraph 7.67). It is com posed of teeth in perfect, sym metrical alignment. If an elderly patient is determ ined to have this  kind of arrangement, grinding individual teeth within the arrangement for sex characteristics and wear patterns makes the setup more believable.  Figure 7.60. Horizontal and Vertical Overlap.  Figure 7.61. Axial Alignment of Mandibular Anterior Denture Teeth.  7.75.2.  Vigorous  Arrangement. A vigorous arrangem ent introduces a m asculine elem ent if rounded, feminine teeth are used, or it intensifies the m asculine image when angular, m asculine teeth are used. Some features of a vigorous arrangement are as follows: 7.75.2.1. To show m ore or less of a tooth’s labial surface can m ake it look m asculine or feminine. The order of increasing m asculinity is  as follows: The labial face is parallel to the curve of the arch, the distal surface of a tooth is rotated outward, the m esial surface is turned inward, and the mesial surface is lapped by the tooth mesial to it (most masculine). 7.75.2.2. The incisal edge of the m axillary lateral incisor is on the sam e plane as the m axillary central incisor. NOTE: This is characteristic of masculinity and old age. 7.75.2.3. When the long axis of a maxillary canine is set vertically from a labiolingual view, the orientation is considered neutral. W hen the inc lination is m ore facial (protruded at the neck), the effect is more masculine. 258  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 7.75.2.4. The use of one or two s mall diastemas (spaces) can lend vigor to a setup. However , some patients have a fixation for ideal denture person would strenuously object to spacings between the teeth even though spaces were present before their natural teeth were extracted. Spacing effects should be used only at the direction of the dentist. setups with chalk-white teeth. This kind of 7.75.3.  Softened  Arrangement. Softened arrangem ents either in troduces a fem inine elem ent when angular masculine teeth are used or intensifies femininity if rounded feminine teeth are used. For the most part, the features of this arrangement are opposite the vigorous type, as follows: 7.75.3.1. The labial face exposure of a tooth, in order of increasing femininity, is as follows: the distal surface is ro tated inward to in crease mesial surface exposure and the mesial surface laps over the distal aspect of the tooth mesial to it (more feminine). 7.75.3.2. The incisal edge of the latera l incisor is raised above the  plane of the central incisor. (This is also a youthful characteristic.) 7.75.3.3. The long axis of a mconsidered neutral. Using this orientation as the baseline, the set of the canine is made feminine by depressing the neck. axillary canine set vertically from a  labiolingual view is 7.75.4. Asymmetrical Arrangements. All tooth arrangements should be somewhat asymmetrical when the right and left sides of the setup are co mpared. However, the variety called asymmetrical is very obviously so. Facial asymmetry is more noticeable in some people than in others. One side of the face may be more angular or maybe even larger than the other side. It is co mmon to assign male characteristics to  the shap e and arran gement of teeth on the hard side and fem ale characteristics to the tooth shapes and arrangem ent on the soft side. A te chnician might make a personal decision for a vigorous or a soft arrang ement, but the dentis t usually m akes a specif ic request for the asymmetrical variety. 7.75.5. Crowded Arrangement. Crowding is usually a result of natural teeth that are too large for the size of the arch. Also, a patient’s natural  mandibular anterior teeth becom e increasingly crowded as  the p atient becom es older. Th is  arrangement shows generalized, moderate, and proximal overlapping of many of the anterior teeth. 7.75.6. Spaced Arrangement: 7.75.6.1. In the natural state, crowding is probably the result of large teeth in a sm all arch. Looking at the opposite situation, sm all teeth situated in a large  arch often show considerable spacing among them. 7.75.6.2. Even though either condition could be there  naturally, it is difficu lt to get patients to accept such arrangements in dentures because th ey tend to think crowding or spacin g is ugly  and usually want these features eliminated in artificial setups. Do not take the liberty of putting such arrangements together without very specific directions from the dentist. NOTE: Trying to create a to tally masculine or totally f eminine effect is usu ally a m istake. Few m en present an absolutely perfect masculine image and the same  is true of wom en and fe mininity. Most teeth show a m ajority of characteristi cs associated with their respect ed sex and a few traits of th e opposite sex.  Section 7N—Balanced Complete Denture Occlusions  7.76. Goal of Complete Balanced Denture Occlusion: 7.76.1. The goal in co mpletely balanced den ture occlu sions is to p roduce m ultiple con tacts AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  259 between maxillary and mandibular teeth in anterior  and posterior areas,  on the right and on the left, in lateral and protrusive excursions. Cusped  teeth (33, 30, or 20 de grees) are usually used in balanced occlusions although 0-degree teeth can be used for this purpose. 7.76.2. In order for denture teeth to achieve maximum c ontact in all m andibular positions, a  compensating curve m ust be incorp orated into th e posterior segm ents of  the denture occlusion. When the molars are set with the compensating curve fully for med, the distobuccal cusp of the maxillary second molar must be no higher than the highest part of the retromolar pad. 7.76.3. Initial development of the occlusal plane begi ns with the incisors and prem olars. After the second premolars are set, the posterior projection of the occlusal plane should hit two-thirds of the way up the retrom olar pads. If the plane is not  properly begun with the incisors and prem olars, there is a chance of coming out too low or too hi gh in relation to the pad s after the compensating curve is formed. 7.76.4. Set the maxillary anterior teeth first (paragraph 7.67), followed by the maxillary posteriors. Center the fossae and central groove of the m axillary posteriors ov er the crest of th e mandibular ridge, buccolingually. The buccal aspect of the maxillary posteriors must not be set lateral to a line dropped perpendicular into the depth of the m axillary buccal sulcus. Do  not set teeth on the tuberosities. 7.76.5. Next, set the mandibular posteriors. Situate the buccal cusps over the crest of the ridge. Do not set teeth on the retrom olar pads. W hen setti ng th e low er te eth to develop late ral ex cursion balance, be sure to incorporate sideshift into the lateral test movements. To get full sideshift value, follow the directions in paragraph 6.21. Complete the setup by positioning the mandibular anterior teeth. 7.77.  Arrangement  of  Cusped  Maxillary  Posterior  Teeth. Re move the occlusion rim  from  the mandibular cast. Find the longest straight segm ent of the residual ridge on the right and left sides. Place reference marks on the anterior and posterior land areas of the cast. Return the mandibular occlusion rim to the cast. Using the reference marks as guides, register the right and left crests of the residual ridge on the top surface of the mandibular occlusion rim. Position each maxillary posterior denture tooth on one side, one at a time, relative to the crest of the mandibular ridge and in relation to a flat metal plate which represents the occlusal plane (Figures 7.47 and 7.52), as follows: 7.77.1. Recommend Space Inclusion. Create a 0.5 mm  space between  the distal surface of the maxillary canine and the mesial of the first premolar. The space makes the final positioning of the mandibular first premolar tooth easier. Set all upper posteriors in proximal contact. 7.77.2.  Forming  the  Compensating  Curve  Pattern  for  All  Cusped  Maxillary  Posteriors (Except Pilkington-Turner 30-Degree Teeth): (NOTE: See Figures 7.62 through 7.64.) 7.77.2.1. Maxillary First and Second Premolars. Place th e maxillary first prem olar with its  long axis at right angles to th e occlusal plane. Place the buccal and lingu al cusps on the plane.  Position the maxillary second premolar in a similar manner. 7.77.2.2. Maxillary Molars. Arrange the buccal cusps of the m olars to form an angle of about 6 degrees w ith the occlusal plan e, beginning at the  buccal cusp of the second premolar. Place the mesiolingual cusp o f the f irst molar on the  plane. Starting with this  cusp, the r emaining lingual cusps should form an angle of 6 degrees with the plane and be more or less parallel with the line of the buccal cusps. The mesiolingual cusp of the first molar touches the plane, and the mesiobuccal cusp is raised 0.5 mm out of contact. The distolingual cusp is raised 0. 5 mm and the distobuccal cusp is 1 mm off the  plane. The mesiolingual cusp of the second m olar is 0.75 260  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 mm off the plane, and the m esiobuccal cusp is 1.25 mm raised out of contact.

The buccal alignm ent of m axillary posterior denture teeth is the same for all cusped forms, as follows: 7.77.4.1. First Buccal Alignment. Align the labial ridge of the canin e, the buccal ridges of the first and second premolars, and the mesial buccal ridge of the first molar (Figure 7.63-C). AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  261 7.77.4.2. Second Buccal Alignment. Align all four buccal ridges of the molars so they are on a separate straight line from the first alignment (Figure 7.63-E). 7.77.5. Stabilizing the Alignment. After setting both sides of the maxillary arch, flow wax around the collars of the teeth to fix them in place secu rely. Few (if any) chang es should be necessary in the maxillary arch from this point on.  Figure 7.63. Setting Maxillary Left Posterior Teeth Using a Flat Template.  7.78.  Setting  Cusped  Mandibular  Posterior  Teeth  for  Balance. The procedures for developing balance are the sam e for all cusped teeth. To get an idea of what is expected, paragraphs 7.78.1.1 through 7.78.1.4 depict typical centric, working, balancing, and protrusive excursion contacts (occlusions), respectively. Carefully and closely follow these directions for setting each kind of tooth. 7.78.1. Mandibular Left First Molar: 7.78.1.1. Centric Occlusion (Figure 7.66). Attach a cone of soft  wax to the left m andibular first molar. Place th e tooth on the m andibular record base in the app roximate position it will assume in centric occlu sion. Close the articu lator. From the buccal view,  while the wax is still soft, position the tooth so the mesiolingual cusp of the maxillary first molar seats in the central fossa of the m andibular first m olar. The triangular ridge of the m esiobuccal cusp of the upper first molar rests in th e buccal development groove of the lower first molar. From  the lingu al view, the mesiolingual cusp of th e upper first molar is seated in  the central fossa of the lower and the mesiolingual cusp of the lower first molar fills the lingual embrasure between the upper second premolar and the first molar. 262  Figure 7.64.

After the right and left first m olars are placed, the working, balancing, and protrusive rises out  of centric occlusion are determ ined for the remaining teeth in the  setup. The incisal guide table and wings are then adjusted to prevent teeth from shifting in soft wax. The lower second molars and premolars are set to match the rises.

Use the basic alignm ent pattern discussed in paragraphs 7.72 through 7.75.6.2 and shown in Figure 7.61. Also see Figure 7.74. 7.79.1.2.  Horizontal  Overlap. Between 1 and 2 mm of horizontal ov erlap is an acceptable range in all cases where the ridges are normally related (Class I). Class II ridge relations require more than a 2 mm horizontal overlap. The incisors are edge to edge in Class III ridge relations. 7.79.1.3. Vertical Overlap. The amount of vertical overlap can  be expected to change directly with increases or decreases in po sterior cusp height. The 30-degree poster iors can g enerate as much as 2 mm of vertical overl ap between upper and lower an terior teeth. W hen 20-degree posteriors are used, the amount of  vertical overlap required m ight be 1 mm. The rule of thum b is since horizontal overlap is m ore or less standa rd for normal ridg e relations (1 to 2  mm), use enough vertical overlap to m ake the anterior te eth balance in working  and protrusive contact relations. 7.79.2. Working Occlusion (Figure 7.67). When the anterior tee th are in a righ t or left working test position, the lab ioincisal edges of the m andibular central and lateral incisors are in contact with the linguoincisal edges of th e maxillary central and lateral in cisors on the working side. The mandibular canine inter digitates with the d istal  portion of  the m axillary latera l in cisor’s in cisal edge and the mesial cusp ridge of the maxillary canine. In the posterior segments, the teeth show working side contacts characteristic of balanced occlusion. 7.79.3. Balancing Side Occlusion (Figure 7.68). The m axillary anterior teeth do not contac t the mandibular anterior teeth on the balancing side. Th e lingual cusps of the m axillary posterior teeth are in contact with the buccal cusps of opposing mandibular posterior teeth. 7.79.4.  Protrusive  Occlusion  (Figure  7.69). When the anterior teeth  are in  th e protrusiv e test position, the maxillary and mandibular incisors touch, edge to edge.

The maxillary anterior teeth are set to achie ve the desired es thetic result. The m andibular anterior teeth are arrang ed in centric occlusion w ith an am ount of horizontal overlap that fits the occlusal classification of the pa tient (for example, Class I is 1 to 2 mm). A slight am ount of vertical overlap is incorporated (0.5 - 1 mm). 7.80.2. The occlusal plane is form ed by using a 20- degree curved plate position ed on the incisal edges of (mandibular) anterior t eeth and the highest part of both retromolar pads (F igure 7.54). The buccal cusps of th e mandibular posteriors are pl aced in a s traight line over the crest of the ontact the undersur face of the mandibular ridge. The teeth are setemplate.

In the expression monoplane oc clusion it is im plied that 0-degree (no cusps) posterior teeth are used. In this denture occlusion, 0-degree teeth are set on a flat plane (no compensating curve).  7.82. Tooth Contact Characteristics: 7.82.1. Anterior Teeth. In centric occlusion, anterior teeth normally have a vertical overlap of 0.0 mm and 1 to 2 mm of horizontal overlap. 7.82.2. Working Side. There are is olated, unprogrammed contacts among a few upper and low er teeth on the working side. 7.82.3.  Balancing  Side. On the balancing side, there is usupper and lower teeth. 7.82.4. Protrusive. When the incisors are edge to edge, there is no contact posteriorly. ually no contact between any of t he 7.83. Advantages of Monoplane Dentures: 7.83.1. Monoplane dentures are somewhat easier to set than completely balanced dentures. 7.83.2. Monoplane dentures function well in almost all patients. It is the  denture occlusion of choice for patients with poor ridges. A set of m onoplane dentures minimizes horizontal pressures on the res idual ridg e. Due to the absence of inclined planes, the ridg es are sub ject to vertical pressures which are considered less damaging. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  271 7.83.3. The monoplane principle is the  denture occlusion of  choice for Class II  and Class III jaw relationships. It is the denture occlusion of choice for crossbite cases. 7.84. Disadvantages of Monoplane Dentures: 7.84.1. The 0-degree teeth don’t look as natural as cusped teeth. 7.84.2. The 0-degree teeth might not break up food as well as cusped teeth. 7.84.3. Monoplane dentures have more of a tendency  to tip than balanced  complete dentures. The lack of protrusive balance is a special invitation to tipping. 7.85. Articulator Settings. Horizontal condylar guidance is set at  30 degrees, lateral condylar guidance is set at 15 degrees, and the incisal guide table is set at 0 degrees. 7.86. Denture Tooth Setting Order.

Maxillary Anterior Teeth. Set the m axillary anterior teeth to m atch the c ontour of the occlusion rim. 7.86.2. Mandibular Anterior Teeth (Centric Occlusion Position). A standard alignment pattern is used with 0 mm vertical overl ap. The horizontal overlap is hi ghly variable and depends on the patient. (For example, Class I is  1 mm, Class II is 5 mm or more, and Class III is 0 mm.) The facial aspect of the mandibularnd f orward of a line dropped perpendicular from the occlusal plane to the mandibular labial sulcus. 7.86.3. Mandibular Posterior Teeth. The buccal cusps of the mandibular posteriors should be set over the crest of the ridge. The front part of a flat plate is set on the incisal edges of the mandibular anterior teeth, and the posterior pa rt of the plate  is s et at the  heights of the retrom olar pads. The mandibular posteriors area m anaged to contact  the undersurface of the plate (Figure 7.54). The distofacial plane of the mandibular canine and the buccal surfaces of the mandibular posteriors fall on a straight line (no second buccal alignment). 7.86.4.

The heels of m onoplane m andibular dentures ha ve a tendency to flip  up when anterior teeth are brought into protrusive contact.

The n ormal buccolingual relationsh ip of m andibular to m axillary posterior teeth is reversed. That is, instead of having the buccal cusps o f mandibular posteriors hitting in the fossae and marginal ridge areas of  maxillary teeth, the buccal cusps of the maxillary posteriors occlude in the fossae and marginal ridge areas of mandibular posteriors. 7.88.3. Crossbite Variations. Crossbite relations may be limited exclusively to the an terior area. The condition might be present in  the posterior area of one side onl y, in the anterior area on one  side only, or in the posterior segments of both sides and in the entire anterior region. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  7.89. Crossbite Condition in Complete Denture Construction. In this condition, the arch form  of the mandibular residual ridge appears to be la rger than the arch form of the m axillary. Two reas ons why maxillary and mandibular ridge relations might dictate denture tooth crossbite are as follows: 273 ssbite are extracted, the residual ridges will7.89.1. W hen natural teeth that have been in croprobably be in crossbite. 7.89.2. Maxillary and mandibular ridges that m ight have been norm ally oriented at one tim e can change into a crossbite relationship because of  drastic resorption in the maxillary and mandibular arches. (That is, the upp er arch narrows and the  lower arch widens.) Som etimes, crossbite ridg e relationships are only marginally abnormal. To make a rational deci sion for or against a crossbite denture occlusion, an imaginary line perpendicular to the occlusal plane is extended into the depth of the maxillary buccal sulcus. If the buccal surfaces of the maxillary posterior teeth have to be set laterally to that lin e for their sulc i to f all over the cres t of the mandibular ridge, the ridges a re in enough crossbite to justify setting a crossbite denture occlusion.  7.90. The 0-Degree Teeth Set in Crossbite (Monoplane Arrangement): 7.90.1. Articulator Settings. Horizontal condylar guidance is se t at 30 degrees, lateral condylar guidance is set at 15 degrees, and incisal table is set at 0 degrees. 7.90.2. Denture Tooth Setting Order. Centric occlusion is the onl y position in which the re are multiple, evenly distributed contacts between maxillary and mandibular posterior teeth as follows: 7.90.2.1. Maxillary Anterior Teeth. The maxillary anterior teeth are set to m atch the contour of the occlusion rim. 7.90.2.2.  Mandibular  Anterior  Teeth  (Centric  Occlusion  Position). Use a standard alignment p attern with  0 mm vertic al ove rlap.  The horizontal overlap is highly variable and depends on the type case being set Class I-1  mm; Class III-0 mm ) or  perhaps the use of a  negative horizontal overlap. A nega tive ho rizontal overlap  is where th e incis al ed ges of the  mandibular anterior teeth are forward of the m axillary anterior teeth in ce ntric occlusion. It is not unusual to need a mandibular an terior tooth for m with a larg er mesiodistal width than the manufacturer’s guide suggests. 7.90.2.3. Mandibular Posterior Teeth. The buccal cusps of the mandibular posterior teeth are set over the crest of the m andibular ridge. Set the  front part of a flat plate on the incisal edges of the mandibular anterior teeth and  situate the pos terior part of the plate at the heights of the  retromolar pads. Arran ge the m andibular poste rior teeth to contact the undersu rface of th e plate. Sometimes the posterior re sidual ridge segm ents in these  cases are so long that a third mandibular premolar is added to the setup. 7.90.2.4. Maxillary Posterior Teeth. The maxillary arch in these kinds of cases can be ra ther small. It m ight be necessary to omit prem olar teeth from  t he setup. Position the m axillary posterior teeth to m ake m aximum contact w ith th e mandibula r p osteriors. Be sure  to  incorporate at least 1 mm of ne gative horizontal overlap in the poste rior segments to prevent cheek biting. 7.90.2.5. Supplemental Considerations (Figure 7.77):  274  Figure 7.77. Flat Plane Posteriors Set in Posterior Crossbite. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  7.90.2.5.1. When a normal upper to lower ridge relationshi p exists in the anterior area, it is necessary to provide a “crossover” where the buccal cusps of m andibular teeth, which negatively overlap maxillary teeth, cross the line of the maxillary buccal cusps to blend with the incisal edges of mandibular anterior teeth. This is usually done by setting the mandibular second premolar in an end-to -end relationship to the m axillary first and second prem olars and completing the “crossover” with the mandibular first premolar (Figure 7.78).

The tooth setting sequence is m axillary anteriors, mandibular anteriors, mandibular posteriors, and maxillary posteriors. 7.91.1.2. Develop the o cclusal plan e by setting  the lower posterior teeth on the crest of the mandibular ridge, again st the undersurface of a 20- degree curved plate. The three points that determine the plane are the m andibular anter ior tee th a nd bilate rally the heigh ts of  the retromolar pads. The posterior teeth in the m axillary arch are set with th eir buccal cusps in the fossae and em brasures of the m andibular teet h, thus reversing the norm al stamp cusp and shearing cusp relationships. 7.91.1.3. It m ight be necessary to provide a “cro ssover” point—a specific area of transition, usually located in the prem olar regions, wh ere the negatively overlapping buccal cusps of mandibular poster ior tee th in cros sbite “c rossover” the line of  the m axillary bucc al cusps to  blend with the m andibular anterior teeth. Excep t for the significant differences m entioned, the arrangement of  the teeth is very sim ilar to th at of a nor mal case in characteristics such as compensating curve and  general alignm ent prin ciples. I t is  dif ficult, b ut possib le, to cr eate balanced complete dentures with this setup. 7.91.2. Standard Arrangement, Using 20-Degree Posteriors: 7.91.2.1. Denture teeth  occupy th eir ord inary places  in a dental arch   without the quadrant  reversal just described. However, the norm al stamp cusp and shearing  cusp relationships are reversed (Figure 7.79). When this m ethod is use d, a mandibular tooth one size larger than the maxillary tooth is  so metimes necessary,  de pending on  the d ifference in size  between the maxilla and mandible.  Figure 7.79. The 20-Degree Teeth in Crossbite (Standard Arrangement).  7.91.2.2.

A balanced  (bilateral) oc clusion is founded on m axillary posterior lingual cusps contacting mandibular posterior fossas. A lingualized  occlusion is a com promise, using anatom ic and nonanatomic posterior tooth forms. 7.93.  Lingualized  Denture  Occlusion  Technique. The lingualized denture  occlusion technique uses 20-, 30-, or 33-degree m axillary posterior teeth a rranged along a standard com pensating curve. The maxillary posteriors are set against 0-degree m andibular posterior teeth with only th e lingual cu sps of the m axillary posterior teeth con tacting their o pponents in  centric occlusion (F igure 7.80). In  lateral excursions, the overall effect resembles bilateral balance.  Figure 7.80. Posterior Tooth Relationship (Lingualized Occlusion).  7.94. Advantages of the Technique: 7.94.1. It can be used in most denture combinations and easily adapted for Class II and III patients. 7.94.2. It uses cusped  maxillary teeth. This is p articularly helpful when the p atient places a h igh priority on esthetics and a nonanato mic occlusal schem e is indicate d by oral conditions such as  severe alveolar ridge resorption. The cusp form is m ore natural in appearance com pared to nonanatomic tooth forms. 7.94.3. It maximizes cutting efficiency with minimized lateral forces. 7.94.4. Bilateral mechanical balanced occlusion is readily obtained. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  7.95. Disadvantages of the Technique: 277 7.95.1.

Ensure a 1 mm  vertical and horizontal overla p for esthetics. Vertic al overlap exceeding 1 mm may jeopardize the balance during excursive movements, causing denture dislodgment. 7.96.5. Open the occlusal vertical dimension prior to setting posterior teeth by lowering the incisal guide pin .5 mm. This will allow adequate room for selective grinding of posterior teeth. 7.96.6. Begin setting m andibular posterior teeth using a 20-degree curv ed template. Position th e posterior of the template at the height of the retromolar pads and ensure the anterior portion of the template rests on  the incis al edges of the mandibular anterior teeth.  Proceed with setting mandibular posterior teeth described in Sequence #2, ensuring the central sulcus is placed over the crest of the mandibular ridge. 7.96.7. Position m axillary posterior teeth on thguidelines: e occlusion rim  and observe the following 7.96.7.1. Position the stamp cusps into the central sulcus areas of the opposing mandibular teeth (Figure 7.81), which will ensure chewing forces are directed over the crest of the ridge only. 7.96.7.2. Elevate the shearing cusp approximately 1 mm to avoid any contact with the opposing denture teeth (Figure 7.81).

AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Section 7R—Wax Trial Dentures 7.99. Wax Pattern of the Denture Base (Wax-Up): 7.99.1. A wax-up is form ed around a completed tooth arrangement. The pattern is a sim ulation of soft tissues attached to the teeth, alveolar processes, and palate. The combination of teeth and wax-up on a record base is called a trial denture because the dentist tests its appearance and function in the patient’s mouth. 7.99.2. The trial denture then becom es a pattern fo r for ming a m old. Denture base plastic is converted from a dough to a solid in  the mold. Based on this series  of events, there are two places  in a complete denture procedure where soft tissue contours must be simulated in wax—the wax-up for try-in (paragraph 7.100) and the final wax-up (paragraph 7.101). 7.99.3. The dentist usually requests a try-in after  the denture teeth are se t in occlusion on the  record base. The wax-up is usually not characteri zed because the dentist often m akes changes to this trial denture. The evaluation of the wax trial denture in the pa tient’s mouth permits the dentist to establish the final tooth position. After the try-in and before wax denture investing procedures, a detailed final wax-up is done. 7.99.4. Waxing and contouring procedures reproduce th e appearance of natural gingival tissues as closely as possible. The external surfaces of th e denture bas es are shaped  to prom ote cleanliness and denture retention. 7.100.  Wax-Up  for  Try-In. The wax-up is  o f the bas ic, stand ardized variety with no provision for individual characterization. Procedures are as follows: 7.100.1. Spot-Luting the Record Bases to the Casts With Molten Wax. Start by locking down the righ t an d left condyle elem ents. Hold the m axillary and m andibular wax trial dentures in centric occlusion. Be sure the incisal guide pin is  touching the incisal guide table. Lute the bases down in enough places so they do not move, but when the time comes for try-in they can be easily removed from their respective casts. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  279 7.100.2. Bulk-Waxing the Facial and Lingual Surfaces. Because the record base probably won’t have enough wax covering the facial and lingual areas to do an adequate contouring job, more wax should be added. The easiest and fastest way to add a lot of wax is to use an eyedropper and an electric wax heater. To prevent  the wax from freezing in the dropper, warm the glass in a Bunsen burner flame. Use the dropper to carry wax and to sp read it onto the trial denture surfaces. A large wax spatula can be used, but the procedure beco mes more time-consuming. Procedural steps are listed individually for maxillary (paragraph  7.100.2.1) and mandibular (paragraph 7.100.2.2) trial  dentures. 7.100.2.1. Bulk-Waxing the Maxillary Trial Denture: 7.100.2.1.1. General. Fill all of  the interproximal areas with wax. Ensure wax is not added to the facial and lingual sections at the same time. When applying bulk wax, allow wax time to sufficiently cool on the facial surface befo re adding wax to the lingual surface.  This will avoid tooth movement in the trial denture wax-up. 7.100.2.1.2. Facial Surface. The wax over the collars of th e teeth should be 1.5 to 2 mm thick and extend from just above the collars down to the sulci of the cast (Figure 7.82). If the border of a flange does not fill a sulcus, correct the discrepancy by adding wax.  Figure 7.82. Bulk-Waxing Trial Dentures.   7.100.2.1.3. Lingual Surface. The wax layer starts occlusal  or incisal to the denture tooth finish lines and proceed s about 10 mm toward th e palatal v ault. Wax near the finish lines should be 1.5 to 2 mm t hick. The lingual wax is bl ended into the palata l area of the record base to make a smooth transition. 7.100.2.2.  Bulk-Waxing  the  Mandibular  Trial  Denture. After bulk-waxing the upper trial denture, check the occlusion be cause denture teeth tend to drif t in warm  wax. Maxillary and mandibular denture  teeth must meet in centric o cclusion while th e pin is on the tab le. Except for palatal b lending, which is not a consideratio n, the steps used for the m axillary setup may also be used for the facial and lingual surfaces of the mandibular trial denture. 7.100.3.  Performing  Gingival  Trimming  (Figure  7.83). In this pro cedure, the o bjective is to simulate the appearance of natural tissue near the necks of the denture t eeth without creating food 280  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 traps. In ke eping with this objec tive, the inte rdental papillae must always extend to  the area of  tooth contact and fill the gingival embrasure and the papillae must be convex in all directions. The following steps apply to both the upper and lower arches: ( NOTE: Keep the point of the carver against the denture tooth surface.)  Figure 7.83. Gingival Trimming.  7.100.3.1. Facial Gingival Trim. Hold the carver at 45 degrees to the horizontal. In one or two continuous, curving m otions, rem ove wax down to the junction between the crown and the collar.

Trim  around the lingual surfaces of the den ture teeth at a  level slightly occlusal o r incisal to th e denture tooth finish lines (about 0. 5 to 1 mm). Do not remove wax from under the finish lines. 7.100.4. Contouring the Wax Denture (Festooning): 7.100.4.1.  Wax-Contouring  Objectives.  The three objectives in wax-contouring are asfollows:  7.100.4.1.1. To sim ulate the root em inences (Fi gure 7.84) and attached gingiva (Figure 7.85). In the m outh, the attached gingiva is directly bound to the bone and is relatively immobile. It extends from the free gingiva toward the sulcus for a variable distance of 3 to 8 mm. The band of attached gingiva is widest in  the anterior regions and narrows posteriorly. The root emineces are most visible in the attached gingival areas. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 7.84. Maxillary Arch Root Eminences. 281  Figure 7.85.

W hen gingival trimming procedures were perform ed, a pointed instrument had to be used to m ake sharp, cl ean cuts. In contrast, contouring wax requires forming convexities and concavities that blend  with one another. To achieve these effects, round-ended instruments work best. The larg e end of a W oodson instrument or a #7 wax spatula should produce the desired result (Figure 7.86). of the denture base in a way that 7.100.4.2. Shaping Root Eminences. Proper root eminence form is an aid to creating a natural appearance for the denture base, as follows: 7.100.4.2.1. Facial Surface Eminences: 7.100.4.2.1.1. In the anterior area, the m axillary canine eminence is the longest and most prominent, the lateral incisor has the shortest eminence, and the central incisor em inence has an in termediate len gth (com pared to the e minence of the c anine and the  la teral incisor). 282  Figure 7.86. Shaping Root Eminences. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005   7.100.4.2.1.2. Looking at a m andibular trial denture,  the canine’s em inence is also the longest, the central incisor’s em inence is th e shortest, and the em inence of the lateral  incisor has a length midway between the length of the canine and the central incisor. 7.100.4.2.1.3. W hereas anterior root em inences are  relatively prom inent, posterior root eminences are less pro minent and generally s horter. P remolar em inences are slightly  longer than molar em inences. When creating the illus ion of root e minences, ensure the concave areas between the roots blend smoothly into the convex eminence areas. Produce eminences and concavities that are round and irregular in height.  Avoid deep, parallel, V-shaped concavities that look like ditches aligned with a ruler. 7.100.4.2.2. Lingual Surface Eminences. Eminences and concavities are m ore subtle th an the least prominent ones on the facial surface. In the maxillary arch, the lingual festooning is supposed to merge smoothly into the contours of the palatal vault. 7.100.4.2.3. Buccolingual Width of the Gingival Trim. After conto uring the em inences, the th ickness of  the gin gival tr im at the  junction between the wax  and t he de nture t eeth should equal a relatively uniform 1 mm around the arch. 7.100.4.3. Shaping Trial Denture Flanges. Muscle action on properly contoured flanges tends to seat dentures m ore firmly on the  residual ri dges and im prove their retention in the m outh (Figure 7.87). 7.100.4.3.1. Labial Flanges (Maxillary and Mandibular). Labial flanges are made slightly concave to accommodate the natural drape of the orbicularis oris muscle. 7.100.4.3.2.  Buccal  Flanges  (Maxillary  and  Mandibular). These flanges are m ade concave to allow for the natural drape of the buccinator muscle. The buccal shelf area of the mandibular buccal flange is somewhat more concave than its counterpart flange in the upper denture. 7.100.4.3.3. Lingual Flange (Mandibular Denture). Make the flange concave to allow for  the borders of the tongue.  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 7.87. Shaping Trial Denture Flanges. 283  7.100.5. Lightly Flaming the Gingival Trim and Mucosal Contouring. Apply the flame to one surface at a time. Generalized heating causes tooth movement. Remember that interdental papillae must be convex in all directions. Blunt the crests slightly; do not leave them needle-sharp. 7.100.6. Checking and Correcting the Occlusion. The teeth must meet in centric occlusion, and the incisal guide pin must touch the incisal guide table. Also, check the lateral excursions. 7.100.7. Touching Up the Wax. If the wax has been disturbed  or any excess wax is on the teeth or flange borders, now is the time for touching up these areas. The trial dentures are now ready for the dentist to evaluate while they are in the patient’s mouth. 7.101. Final Wax-Up. The assumptions at this point are that  (1) a basic wax-up  was done, and (2) the dentist performed a try-in, m ade adjustments, and returned  the wax trial denture to the laboratory. The basic wax-up’s gingival trim  has mo re or less b een ruined b y the neces sary adjustments. To pro duce a final, characterized wax-up, the steps in paragraphs 7.101.1 through 7.101.3 must be followed. 7.101.1. Perform the Maxillary Denture Final Wax-Up: ide for the dentist does not choose to do corporated into a maxillary denture to 7.101.1.1. Re move the m axillary wax trial d enture  from the cas t and set it asmoment. 7.101.1.2. Create a posterior palatal seal as follows:  7.101.1.2.1. A posterior palatal seal is a feature inoffset denture processing changes in th e acrylic and im prove denture retention. ( NOTE: This seal is not recom mended for the positiv e-pressure, injec tion-molded te chnique SR Ivocap®.) In processing, the dentom the cast s lightly. This shrinkage is m ost obvious along the posteriaxillary denture. If compensation is  not m ade f or th is distor tion, the posterio r borde r of  the dentu re will no t touch the p atient’s tissue when the denture is  placed in th e mouth. As a result, air enters  between the denture base and the mouth tissupatient’s ridge and the palate. 7.101.1.2.2. The dentist m ay develop a posterior pala tal seal in the fina l impression while the patient is present. If the this, he or she m ay ask the es, and the denture falls away from the ure acrylic shrinks away fror border of the mAFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 technician to create the seal. The seal is actual ly cut into th e master cast, and an acceptab le time to do this is af ter the dentist p erforms the wax denture try-in. Th e most desirable tim e to do this is before the record base is fabricated. 7.101.1.2.3. The last chance anyone has to do this is after the wax denture boilout procedure. The outline and depth o f the poster ior palatal seal preparation on the c ast depends on the anatomy of the m outh, condition of the tissues,  and desires of the dentist. This m akes it imperative for the dentist to assum e com plete responsibility for pres cribing the location, depth, width, and outline of the seal. If the den tist does not prepare the cast, he or she m ust furnish the technician com plete and explicit  instructions so no doubt rem ains about the procedures to execute. 7.101.1.2.4. The posterior border of the denture is determined at the vibrating line the dentist has marked on the cast. In the  absence of a m arking, the poster ior border of the denture is determined by using rig ht and left pterygom axillary notches and the p alatine foveae. The posterior border of the maxillary denture and the posterior edge of the posterior palatal seal must coincide. 7.101.1.2.5. The form and dimensions of a popular ki nd of posterior-palat al seal are shown in Figure 7.88. A #6 round bur and a Roach carver perform the job satisfactorily. 284   Figure 7.88. Shape and Dimensions of a Posterior-Palatal Seal.  7.101.1.3. Cut the palatal vault from  the wax trial denture (Figure 7.89). Following a U-shaped line that is 5 to 6mm palatal to the lingual finish  lines of the maxillary teeth, cut out the palatal area with a spiral plaster saw or p alatal cutting  bur. Apply as little pres sure as possible across the heels of the record base. The compression will break it. Smooth the cut edge o f the record base. Replace the wax denture on the cast and check the occlusion. 7.101.1.4. Completely seal the borders of the upper a nd lower record bases to their casts. Be sure to also seal down the pala tal cut edge of the maxillary record base (Figure 7.89-B). While performing the sealing  procedure, it is very  importan t to lock down the condylar elem ents, place the wax dentures in centric occlusion, and hold the pin in contact with the table. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 7.89. Uniform Palatal Thickness (Sheet-Wax Method). 285  7.101.1.5. Create a unif orm palatal thickness. T he pati ent’s speech is affected if the palatal vault of the denture is too thick. Make a vau lt area thick enough so it is reasonably strong, but not so th ick as to cause speech im pairment. The sheet-wax and plastic  pattern methods are as follows: 7.101.1.5.1. Sheet-Wax Method for Creating Uniform Palatal Thickness: 7.101.1.5.1.1. If the true rugae are to  be reproduced in the dent ure, place a piece of .003-inch tinfoil over the anterior palatal area of the cast within the cutout portion of the record base. Adapt and burnish the tinf oil to the cast to form a matrix of the rugae. Remove the matrix from the cast without distorting it. By flowing m elted baseplate wax into the  grooves, reinforce the side that was in cont act with the cast. Put  the tinfoil reproduction aside. 7.101.1.5.1.2. Flash-wax the rugae regi on on the cast. To obtain  a unif orm thickness in the palatal area, p lace a layer of  soft 28 gauge (ga) wax in th e cutout part of the rec ord base and ad apt the wax  to the cas t (Figure  7.89-C). Cover this layer of wax with a softened baseplate wax (Figure 7.89-D). Be careful not to stretch or sm ash the  wax sheets. Blend the edges of the wax sheets into the palatal contours. When the palatal area 286  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 is smoothly and uniformly waxed, position the prepared tinfoil matrix accurately over the rugae area. Secure it to the baseplate wax by luting the outer border with a hot spatula. 7.101.1.5.2.  Plastic  Pattern  Method. Flexib le pla stic pa tterns that im itate the  surf ace characteristics of the palatal vault, including ru gae, are av ailable in various sizes. To use them, pick one that m atches th e dim ensions of the pala tal cutout. Substitu te th e plastic  pattern for the layer of baseplate wax in patients like the feel of simulated rugae in the roof of a denture.

Use the basic, uncharacterized wax-up as  a point of departure for developing a more natural appearing denture base. The regularity of the gingival trim should be broken up by varying the height and shape of the scallops and interdental papillae (Figure 7.90). As the figure shows, it is typical for  the maxillary canine gingival m argin to be the h ighest in th e olar m argin to be slightly   lower. T his re lationship is  quadrant and for the first premfrequently ignored. Many technicians incorrectl y persist in producing a gross step between the heights of the canine and first premolar gingival margins.  Figure 7.90. Characterized Gingival Trimming.  7.101.1.7.2. The architecture of a person’s ging iva changes with age. (See Figure 7. 91 for the age factor in gingival trimm ing.) On young pe ople, use a half-circl e gingival trim. W ith middle-aged persons, use a half-circle and halfelderly persons, produce a combination of half-oval and blunted “V” gingival trim s.

Stippling effects m ake a denture base appear m ore natural by breaking up the continuity of large, reflective surfaces. The result is much more pleasing than a glossy, shiny look. Using these techniques, ther e should be no stippling within 1 mm of the gingival margins and 3 mm of the peripheral borders. While working with the wax-up, stippling may be accomplished by one of the following methods:  7.101.1.9.1.  Positive  Stippling  (Blow-On  Technique). P lace paper tape on the facial surfaces of the teeth. P ick up molten wax with an appropriate instrument (for example, a #7 wax spatula). Blow the wax off th e instrument onto the denture’s facial surfaces to impart a bumpy effe ct. Lightly flam e the denture wa x-up following the application of blow-on stippling to remove sharp corners from the stippled area. Stippling should be most evident in areas that replicate attached gingiva and concave portions of the denture base. 7.101.1.9.2.  Negative  Stippling  (Denture  Brush  Technique). Stab the denture brush repeatedly into the wax where stip pling is  desired, leaving m any tiny  holes and flecks of wax on the high and low contours of the wax denture. Carefully pass a low, brush flam e over the roughened areas. The objective is to  cause the wax flecks to disappear, the high contours to  glaze somewhat, and the m ost pr ominent stippling to rem ain in areas that replicate attached gingiva and concave portions of the denture base. 7.101.2.  Perform  a  Mandibular  Denture  Final  Wax-Up. W ith the exception of palata l contouring considerations, the rule s for characterizing a m axillary wax denture are essentially the same as its mandibular counterpart. See Figure 7.92 for a finished wax-up. 7.101.3. Check the Occlusion. No matter how good the characterized wax-up looks or how proud you might be of the results, the wa x-up is not finished  until the occlus ion is verified. Balanced complete dentures must show m ultiple, bilateral posterior contacts in centric occlusion with th e incisal guide pin touching the inci sal guid e tab le. Check la teral  excursions. Balanced com plete dentures should have both cross-tooth and cross-arch contacts in working excursions. 288  Figure 7.92. Completed Characterized Wax-Up. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Section 7S—Flasking (Investing) Wax Dentures 7.102. Overview. Dental laboratory technology techniques and procedures cont inue to grow at an ever-increasing pace. Technicians now have a m ultitude of  alternative techniques to cho ose from to proces s denture bases. Depending on the technique selected by the dentist, a technician can use different types of flasks. Therefore, this section includes a specif ic discussion of flask com ponents with their respective technique (that is, compression flask, positive pressure injection flask, a nd sleeved pour technique flask). 7.103. Definition. For general purposes, a flask is a metal or plastic (microwave safe) case used to make sectional molds for processing acrylic  resin during the fabrication of de nture bases and other prosthetic appliances. Flasking is the process of investing the final wax-up in a flask to make a sectional mold. 7.104. Flasking Compression Molded Denture Bases: 7.104.1. Types of Compression Flasks: compression flasks available.  The traditional flask is 7.104.1.1. There are varying types of composed of brass and is used for heat-curing the denture base m aterial (F igure 7.93). An alternate type of compression flask is a plas tic flask used wh en microwave processing denture base material (Figure 7.94). 7.104.1.2. The traditional brass compression fknockout plate in the bottommicrowaveable flask is composed similarly; however, does not have a knockout plate. 7.104.1.3. Flasking is perform ed in th ree steps. The first step, called lower half flasking, requires one pour of dental stone in a flask’s lower section. In the second step, the uppersection of the flask is position ed o n the lower  section and  dental ston e is poured up to the incisal edges and occlusal surfaces  of the teeth to for m the upper half flasking. The last step consists of pouring the occlusalflask. The best results are obtained when all three sections  are m ade in dental stone.  NOTE:  Except for the knockout plate, traditional brass flask part s are not interchangeable w ith parts from other flasks. Ensure all flask parts are num bered and the part num bers on the flask are identical. Failure to do so will create an unwanted processing error. (Microwaveable flask parts are all interchangeable.)  lask is  com posed of a lower section with a  cap and placing the lid on the  and an upper section with a separate lid. The plastic   AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 7.93. Brass Compression Molded Flask. 289  Figure 7.94. Microwaveable Compression Flask.  s after every use. Clean the flask with a properly seated in the upper half of the flask. 7.104.1.4. Clean, inspect, and lubricate all flask partmild detergent under running water. Inspect the fl ask parts for stone particles. When cleaning a brass flask, ensure the flask guide pins are (NOTE: The guide pins control the position of the upper  half flask in relation to the lower half flask. Improper seating of the guide  pins can cause flasking and de flasking errors.) A thin film of petrolatum or silicone spray applied to the flask makes stone removal easier. This action also prevents brass flasks from corroding. 7.104.1.5. Ensure the cast and final wax-up clears th e internal surface of the flask by certain  essential minimums. NOTE: The length, width, and height of a cast must be evaluated within a flask before the cast is indexed and mounted in an articulator. 7.104.2. Flasking the Maxillary Wax Denture (Figure 7.95): 7.104.2.1. Lower Half Flasking: 7.104.2.1.1. Try the m axillary wax denture in the bo ttom half of the flask. There should be at least a 6 mm clearan ce between  the base of the cas t and the s ides of the flask.  Place the  290  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 top half of the flask on the bottom half. Check for a minimum of 6 mm of clearance between the denture teeth and the rim  of the  top half . Remove the t op half and brush a separating liquid (green soap or commercial stone to stone  separator) on the base of the cast. This will ensure the dental stone separates cleanly from the master cast after the denture is processed.  Figure 7.95. Flasking the Maxillary Wax Denture.  7.104.2.1.2. When using a brass flask, position the  knockout plate in th e bottom half and make a fresh m ix of de ntal stone. F ill the bottom half of the flask about three-quarters full with stone. Press the c ast into the st one to within 3 mm of t he bottom. (NOTE: Ensure the denture’s occlusal plane is as parallel to the base of the bottom half as possible.) Smooth the area between the edge of the cast and the edge of the flask with your fingers. Do not produce undercuts in the stone. Ensure the land area of the cast and the entire rim  of the fl ask are cleanly and completely exposed. 7.104.2.2. Upper Half Flasking: 7.104.2.2.1. Check to see that there is 6 mm of cl earance between the te eth and the rim  of the top half. Make sure there is  metal-to-metal contact between the edges of the bottom and top halves. Apply a stone to stone separator flasking. Paint the wax denture with a surface tension reducing agent (debubblizer). 7.104.2.2.2. With the top half in place, pour stone to a level that barely covers the incisal edge and occlusal surfaces of the teeth. The obj ective is to ensure the stone flows into every detail of the wax-up in as bubbl e-free a m anner as possible. W hile the stone is still soft, expose the incisal edges and occlusal surfaces of  the teeth with two or three wipes of your finger. Do this quickly. A con tinual disturbance of dental st one that is s etting weakens the stone. to exposed stone surfaces on the lower half AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  291 7.104.2.2.3. Apply a coating of stone to stone separa tor to the top of th e second pour after it has set. Do not use a separator that discolors denture teeth; instead, use a fluid such as liquid green soap. 7.104.2.2.4. The next step is to pour the cap an d position the lid. Press  the lid dow n until there is definite metal-to-metal contact around the entire rim. Remove any excess stone after the stone reaches the final set. 7.104.3. Flasking the Mandibular Wax Denture (Figure 7.96):  Figure 7.96. Flasking the Mandibular Wax Denture.  7.104.3.1. Lower Half Flasking. Lower half fl asking a mandibular wax denture is done in the same way as a m axillary wax denture except as  f ollows: do not f low dental ston e into th e tongue space area, be sure to re inforce the heels of the m andibular cast with dental stone, and do not forget to orient the wax denture’s occlusal plane as parallel as possible to the base of the  bottom half. 7.104.3.2. Upper Half Flasking. The directions are the same as for the maxillary wax denture. To facilitate deflasking a lower denture, wipe  a trough into the tongue s pace of the upper half in the ston e surface.

Wax  Elimination. Let the dental stone in the flasks harden for at least 1 hour beforeattempting to eliminate the wax. 7.104.5. Silicone Insulating Paste. The use of t his material is widely accepted when  the method of processing the denture base does not involve  the use of microwave en ergy. Silicone insulating paste is used as an investm ent coating m aterial. After lower half flasking the cast, apply the silicone insulating paste to the wa x denture base and teeth. A pplication of the silicone material is followed by com pletion of full flasking procedures. Th e flexible silicone insulating material has several advantages. It facilitate s deflasking, reduces finishing tim e, serves as a m oisture barrier, and eliminates the need for acryl ic to stone separator in the uppe r mold cavity. Its disadvantages include the cost of the m aterial and the tendency for the denture teeth to be dislodged from  the mold. The procedures for full flas king the wax denture, using silico ne insu lating paste,  are as follows:  292  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 7.104.5.1. Apply a stone to stone sepa rator to the exposed stone  surfaces on th e lower half-flasking. 7.104.5.2. Mix the silicone insulating m aterial base  and catalyst together according to the manufacturer’s directions. Five cc of the m aterial are adequ ate for sm all dentures, but 10 cc  may be needed for larger dentures. 7.104.5.3. Using a mixing spatula or gloved finger, a pply the material to the denture base wax-up while m aintaining an approxim ate thicknes s of 1 to 2 mm  (Figure 7.97). Do not apply insulating paste to th e incisal edges  or occlusal  surfaces of  denture te eth. Gradually taper the material from the denture base  surfaces, taking care not to overlap the m aterial o nto thes e s urfaces.  NOTE:  Silicone insulating paste is a nonrig id material. Overlapping of the incisal edges and  occlusal surfaces can cau se vertical processing error and/or denture tooth dislodgment. to the incisal edges and occlusal Figure 7.97. Alternate Flasking Method Using Silicone Mold Material.  7.104.5.4.

Fill the upper half with(NOTE: Do not expose the incisal edges and occlusal  surfaces during upper half flasking using this technique.) Follow final flasking procedures by pourin g the stone cap and replacing the lid of the flask. 7.105. Flasking Positive Pressure Injection Molded Denture Bases: 7.105.1. Positive Pressure Injection Flask: 7.105.1.1. The flask is com posed of upper and lower sections with an accom panying plastic AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  293 cover for each (Figure 7.98). Flask ing is perform ed in two steps. The first step requires one pour of dental stone in a flask’s lower section  and is called lower half flasking. In the second step, the upper section of the flask is positioned on the lower section and dental stone is poured, covering the incisal edges and occlusal surfaces  of the teeth to form  the upper half flasking. The best results are obtained when all sections are made in dental stone. 7.105.1.2. Clean, inspect, and lubricate all flask parts after every use. Clean the flask with a mild detergent under running water while inspec ting for and rem oving stone particles. A thin film of petr olatum or silicone sp ray applied to the f lask makes stone re moval easier. NOTE: Flask parts are interchangeable with parts from other flasks.  Figure 7.98. Positive Pressure Injection Flask.  7.105.1.3. Make sure the cast and final wax-up clears the internal surface of the flask by certain essential minimums. NOTE: It is highly recom mended that the  length, width, and height of a  cast be evaluated within a flask before the cast is indexed and mounted in an articulator. 7.105.2. Flasking the Final Wax-Up: 7.105.2.1. Lower Half Flasking: 7.105.2.1.1. The cast must be thoroughly saturated with SDS prior to investing. Try the wax denture in the bottom half of the flask with the lower cover in place. There should be at least a 1 cm of clearance between the base of the cast and the sides of the flask. 7.105.2.1.2. Place th e top half of the flask on the bottom  half. There should be 16  mm of clearance from  the rim  of the upper half flask to the incisal edges an d occlusal surfaces.  Remove the top half and brush  a separating liquid (green soap  or commercial stone to stone separator) on the base o f the cast. (I t is very important to separate the cast cleanly from the investment after the denture is processed.) 7.105.2.1.3. Make a fresh m ix of de ntal stone and  fill the bottom  half about three-q uarters full with stone. Press the cast into the stone to within 3  mm of the bottom and position  the investment aid. Smooth the area between the edge  of the cast and the edge of the fl ask with your fingers. Be sure not to produce undercuts in the stone. The land area of the cast, tongue space on mandibular dentures, and the entire rim of the flask should be clean and completely exposed. To ensure an optim al investm ent cha nnel, level off the ston e to the top of the investment aid (Figure 7.99). NOTE: Ensure the denture’s occlusal plane is as parallel to the 294  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 base of the bottom  half as possible. Also en sure the dental stone does not extend above the top of the investment aid. 7.105.2.2. Upper Half Flasking: 7.105.2.2.1. Start by removing the investment aid and replacing it with the injection tube and funnel (Figure 7.100). It is very  important not to damage the edges of the injection channel. This area form s a seal to resist back pressu re during the injection process so the denture resin does not escape from the posterior shoulder of the flask.  Figure 7.99. Injection Mold Flasking the Wax Denture.  Figure 7.100. Injection Tube and Funnel Placement.  7.105.2.2.2. Position th e flask’s up per half ov er th e lower half with th e plastic cover in  place. Ensure there is m etal to m etal contact of  the flask halves and th e plastic cov er fully seats in the upper half of the flask.  NOTE: If the plastic cover does  not fully seat due to  interference of the denture wax-up, reinvestment of the lower half may be necessary. 7.105.2.2.3. The form ation of injection ch annels  is now necessary p rior to upp er half flasking. Depending upon the type of prostheses being invested, it may be necessary to form one or several injection channels. For com plete upper dentures and interim  RPDs, one AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  295 injection channel is usually sufficient (Figure 7.101). When investing a mandibular complete denture two  injection channels are necessary  (Figure 7.1 02.) For R PDs having isolated  denture base areas, numerous injection channels may be necessary (Figure 7.103).  Figure 7.101. Placement of Injection Channel (Maxillary Denture).  Figure 7.102. Placement of Injection Channel (Mandibular Denture).   7.105.2.2.4. When evaluating the need for and p lacement of investment channels, place the flask on end with the anterior te eth closest to the bench top a nd locate the highest areas of the wax-up (norm ally those areas c losest to the injec tion tube). These ar eas will req uire an injection channel. However, when evaluating prostheses with multiple isolated denture base areas an injection chan nel is required for each.  NOTE: The injec tion channel must be  located at the highest portion of the wax-up within the area being injected. 7.105.2.2.5. Formation of the injection channel is done by applying rolled baseplate wax 3 to 5 mm in diameter to the lower half flasking. Ap ply the channel from the tip of the injection tube to the exact loc ation on th e denture base wax-up previously  identified as requ iring an 296  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 injection channel. Using a hot in strument, seal the basep leate wax to th e injection tube tip  and the denture base. Complete the process by ensuring the wax-up is smooth paying special attention to the injection tube tip.  Figure 7.103. Placement of Injection Channel (Multiple Areas).  7.105.2.2.6. Begin the final stage of the flasking process by applying a stone-to-stone separator to the exposed stone surfaces on th e lower half flasking. Paint the wax denture with a surface tension reducing agent (debubblizer). 7.105.2.2.7. With the top half in place, pour stone to a level that barely covers the incisal edge and occlusal surfaces of the denture te eth. Once the stone reaches a level covering the denture teeth, place a thoroughly soaked paper in sert, which aids devestm ent, into the wet  stone in the  flask and continue to fill. W hen the flask is filled with sto ne, place th e flask cover into position in the upper half flask and press down until com pletely seated. Remove any excess stone from the exterior of the flask. 7.105.3.  Wax  Elimination. Let the dental stone in the flasks harden for at least 1 hour beforeattempting to eliminate the wax.  7.106. Flasking Liquid Pour Resin Denture Bases: 7.106.1. Pour Flask. The flask is composed of four major components with two flask spring clips and a pouring spout or reservoir (Figure 7.104). The outer flask sleeve is positioned over the inner flask sleev e with the to p and botto m plates in  place which for m a seal prev enting the m olten hydrocolloid from escaping the fl ask. The locating pins  found on the flask’s bottom  plate and top plate allow the technician to accurately reasse mble the flask during pr ocessing. The flask spring clips are used to hold the flask together during pouring and processin g, and the pour spout or reservoir allows the hydrocolloid additional material to draw from as it solidifies. 7.106.2. Cast Preparation. This technique employs the use of reversible hydrocolloid. Therefore, adequate cast preparatio n is neces sary to facilitate the withd rawal of the cast from  the solidified hydrocolloid and provide a means of accurately retu rning the cast to its proper o rientation within the prepared m old. The following capabilities of this technique: steps will help the technician take full advantage of the  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 7.104. Unassembled Pour Flask. 297   7.106.2.1. Prepare the cast by trimm ing the base at a slight convergence angle toward the land area of the cast. This is best done before mounting the cast to the articulator. 7.106.2.2. Clean the land area of the cast by removing any wax debris. T he land area must be 3 mm wide to provide an adequate seat when the cast is returned to the mold for processing. 7.106.2.3. Prepare the case for investm ent by evaluating areas of the cast not  in the design that could potentially tear the hydrocol loid when the cast is lifted from  the m old. Areas requiring blockout are usually located under the lingual bar of  an RPD and deep sulcus areas. The use of modeling clay is the recomm ended method of blockout. The blockout material used should not be removed once the hydrocolloid has solidified  within the mold, and the m aterial should stay in place throughout the entire processing of the denture base. 7.106.2.4. Soak the cast in a 110  oF (38  oC) SDS water ba th for 5 m inutes. This p repares the cast to receive the m olten hydrocolloid and allows  the material to flow into the m inute details of the wax-up. Presoaking the cast also prevents prem ature solidification of the duplicating material while investing. 7.106.3. Preparing the Hydrocolloid for Pouring: 7.106.3.1. If the labo ratory has an auto-dup licator, sim ply draw enough m aterial to fill th e flask. If the laboratory does not have an auto- duplicator, prepare a batc h of hydrocolloid using a pressure pot. A soldering stand, bunsen burner, pressure pot, and thermometer will be needed. 7.106.3.2. Start by placing diced cubes of  hydrocolloid m aterial into  the pressure pot, place it on the soldering stand, and apply heat by using the bunsen burner. Only apply enough heat to melt the hydrocolloid. Be careful not to overheat the material! 7.106.3.3. When the hydrocolloid is com pletely melted, pour the material into a 16 oz (473 cc) measuring cup and allow it to cool. Monitor the  hydrocolloid constantly, using a therm ometer. When the m aterial reaches a tem perature of 120  oF (49  oC), it is ready to pour. Pour the hydrocolloid into th e flask as soon as it reach es the desired pouring tem perature (parag raph 7.106.4). 298  7.106.4.

The sl it in the outer sleeve must be positioned over a solid area  these two com ponents are not positioned correctly, the molten hydrocolloid will escape the mold when poured. 7.106.4.2. Place the sleeves on the b ottom plate. When positioning th e sleeves on  the bottom plate, ensure the locating pin properly articula tes with the locating pin slot found on the inner sleeve (Figure 7.105).  Figure 7.105. Assembled Flask.  e flask (Fig ure 7.106).  ( NOTE:  Before the cast can  be 7.106.4.3. Position  the cast in thpositioned in the f lask, the te chnician must have  identified where the s prues will b e placed to pour the denture base.) W hen pouring som e dent ure base areas, it m ay be necessary to wax sprue vents prior to investing.  Figure 7.106. Spruing Attachment Sites.  7.106.4.4. Mount the top plate with the reservoir and spring clips in place. 7.106.4.5. Pour the hydrocolloid into the flask fill ing it completely (Fig ure 7.107). Then place AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  299 the flask in a cooling water bath. To promote rapid cooling of the hydrocolloid the flask should be immersed to three-quarters of its height.  Figure 7.107. Filling the Flask With Hydrocolloid.  7.107.  Wax  Elimination  for  Compression  and  Injection  Molded  Flasks. The purpose of wax elimination and mold preparation is to form a mold cavity into which acrylic resin can be packed. 7.107.1. Equipment and Materials. The following should be used: 7.107.1.1. Flask carrier. This equipm ent item safely carries flasks into and out of boiling water while maintaining constant compressive force on the flasks. 7.107.1.2. Boil-out tanks. A three-tank unit is most conve nient. The first tank is used to soften wax and remove the bulk wax, the second tank is used for the detergent rinse, and the third tank is used for flushing the mold cavity with clean, hot water. 7.107.1.3. Insulated gloves. Always use protective gloves when handling hot flasks because the flask and the boiling water can cause burns. 7.107.1.4. Two plaster knives. Use the “screwdriver” ends to pry flask open. 7.107.1.5. Large dipper. Use a dipper that has a hole in the bottom. 7.107.1.6. Medium stiff bristled brush and a powered household detergent containing no bleach additives. 7.107.1.7. Tinfoil substitute or appropriate acrylic to stone separating medium and a brush. 7.107.2. Wax Elimination Procedures (Figure 7.108): 7.107.2.1. Place the flask in boiling water for 5 m inutes. The i mmersion tim e can vary according to the number of flasks in  the water. Ideally, the wax should com e out in one piece when the mold is separated. Too little time in the tank results in dentur e teeth being pulled out of the mold along with the cold wax. Conversely, too much heating time causes the wax to melt and soak into the mold. 7.107.2.2. Remove the flask from the first tank and open it. Use two plaster knives and pry both sides of the flask at the same time. 7.107.2.3. Lift out the record base and softened wax with a knife or forceps. Hopefully, the wax will come out in one piece. 300  Figure 7.108. Wax Elimination Procedures. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  7.107.2.4. Using detergent solution from the second tank, clean and flush the mold. Use a brush that reaches into all of  the recesses of the m old. Watch for  denture teeth that might have come loose. Retrieve loosened teeth with forceps so they can be properly positioned later. 7.107.2.5. Flush the mold with clean, hot water from  the third tank. Avoid cross-contam ination of the th ree tanks. Ensure the wa ter taken from the detergent or the clean hot wate r tanks to  flush a mold runs off into the first, flask-hea ting tank. Because molten wax floats on water, use this trait to your advantage. W hen flushing a m old, do not use the last quarter inch of water in the dipper because it might contain suspended wax. 7.107.2.6. Set the mold on end to drain and dry. Let it cool enough to be handled safely. 7.108. Wax Elimination Using a Reversible Hydrocolloid Pour Technique Flask: 7.108.1. Equipment and Materials. (See paragraph 7.107.1). 7.108.2. Wax Elimination Procedures: following com plete solidification of the 7.108.2.1. Re move flask from the cooling bath hydrocolloid. Remove the flask clamps and rese rvoir and trim away exc ess material from the reservoir. 7.108.2.2. Using plaster knives, lift the cast from th e flask or hydrocolloid. (Be careful not to fracture the cast.) Remove the acrylic teeth and base plate from the wax-up. 7.108.2.3. Using detergent solution from  the sec ond tank, clean and flush the cast and teeth. Place the cast on the flask carrier and complete boilout procedures. Denture teeth can be placed AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  301 in a strainer and flushed with boiling water to ensure complete wax rem7.107.2.4). 7.108.2.4. Flush the cast and teeth with clean, hot water from the third tank. 7.108.2.5. Set the cast on end to drain and dry. Place the teeth in a safe area to ensure the teeth are not lost or destroyed. oval (paragraph 7.109. Mold Preparation for Compression and Injection Molded Flasks: 7.109.1.  Posterior  Palatal  Seal. P lacement of a posterio r palatal s eal is not reco mmended for injection molded processing. If tradition al compression heat curing is the m ethod of processing chosen, it is assumed that placement of the posterior palatal seal has already been accomplished on the maxillary cast (paragraph 7.101.1.2). 7.109.2. Relief Areas. Relief is occasionally required in a denture to reduce or eliminate pressure on selective and specific soft tissue  areas designated by the dentist. When relief is prescribed, the incisive papilla, median palatine raphe, mental foramen, or tori formations are the structures most likely to receive special attention. To get the  desired amount of relief, cut appropriate thicknesses of foil and glue them in place (Figure 7.109). Cyanoacrylate glue is recommended.  Figure 7.109. Median Palatine Raphe Relief.  7.109.3. Loose Teeth. Seat denture teeth that m ight have come loose during the wax elim ination step. 7.109.4. Applying Tinfoil Substitute: 7.109.4.1. Because plaster and stone absorb fluid, seal the surface of the mold to prevent acrylic resin monomer from soaking into it during proc essing. If the m onomer penetrates the m old’s surface, the polym erized denture bas e fuses with  the stone cast and the denture m old. If this  occurs, the denture base is ruined. 7.109.4.2. Gypsum surfaces that contact unprocessed  acrylic resin can be  sealed with various separating m edia. To date,  tinfoil is probably the best separa tor used. Applying tinfoil to a the m ost ex perienced waxed denture is a tedious and tim e-consuming process for all but technician. An alternative, popular m ethod of  preventing  the m old surface from absorbing  liquid resin is to paint the mold with a liquid alginate called tinfoil substitute. 7.109.4.3. To use the tinfoil substitute, elim inate all wax residue from the m old and carefully 302  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 apply the s eparating material to se al the su rface completely. The tinfoil s ubstitute flows m ore readily and penetrates the m old surface better. Th is separating medium reacts chemically with the surface stone, creating a microscopic layer sealing the surface of the cast. A visib le buildup of separator is not necessary for it to be effective. 7.109.4.4. The tinfoil su bstitute is rendered usel ess by gypsum particle contam ination. NOTE: Never dip a used swab or brush into the bulk supp ly of tinfoil substitute. Instead, pour as m uch tinfoil substitute as is needed into a separate container and discard the unused material. 7.109.4.5. While the mold is still warm , apply a coat of separating material to the lower half of the flask (cast side). P aint the separator af ter the steam ing action of the m old has stopped. (Steam escaping from the stone will cause sep arator that has been applied to lift from the stone surface.) Apply the second coat just before  procedures (paragraph 7.117). Using two coats at different tim es is a safety precaution. If the polyethylene sheet tears d uring packing, the first coat of sepa rating material prevents the acrylic resin from sticking to the cast in the area of the tear. 7.109.4.6. Paint two coats of separating m aterial on  the upper half of the flask (mold side). Apply the first coat after the clean mold has stopped steam ing, and i s still warm. Apply the second coat after the first coat dr ies. Try not to let th e separator pool in in terproximal areas. If tinfoil substitute has covered the ridgelap portion of the denture teeth,  let it dry. Use a cotton-tipped swab, damp with acrylic monomer, to remove the film. closing the flask during packing7.110. Mold Preparation Using a Reversible Hydrocolloid Pour Technique Flask: 7.110.1. First, remove the cast by gently prying up  on the base using two knifes (Figure 7.110-A). Next, rem ove the flask exterior sleeve to e xpose a window of solidified hydrocolloid m aterial (Figure 7.110-B).  Figure 7.110. Removal of the Cast and Hydrocolloid Flask Exterior Sleeve.  7.110.2. Using the appropriate spru e cutter (Figure 7.111), bore a  main pouring channel through the hydrocolloid window to the height of the dentur e base area being processed. This channel will allow the liquid acrylic to be poured into the mold cavity. The pouring channel should be attached to the denture base area as high on its border as  possible to enable air to escape the  mold while pouring. Also bore a slightly sm aller gauge auxiliar y channel in the opposite  side of the denture  base to allow the liquid acrylic to completely fill the mold cavity without entrapping air. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 7.111. Placement of Pouring Channels. 303  7.110.3. Rinse the entire m old cavity  with a sm all am ount of denatu red alcohol to rem ove all  surface contaminants from the hydrocolloid and allow to dry. 7.110.4.

Prepare the denture teeth for processing by dabbing  a m onomer-soaked cotton tip applicator. Place the to oth in the hydrocolloid mold  in its proper position. Carefully seat the cast with com ponents (c lasps and RPD frameworks) in to the f lask being  caref ul not to tear the hydrocolloid or dislodge the denture teeth.

Characterization is done afte r the wax denture is boiled  out, but before the mold is filled. Characterization of the denture base imparts the desired natural appearance to the denture. 7.112. Selecting a Primary Denture Base Color and Performing Supplemental Tinting: 7.112.1. Fine, superficial blood vessel com plexes are visible on natural mucosal tissues, and m ost good denture base resins come with red nylon fibers that simulate those blood vessels. 7.112.2. Oral mucosal color differs from person to person and is primarily related to the degree of pigmentation contained with the tis sue. In light skinned people, the free gi ngival areas are pale pink, the attached gingival is light red, and the al veolar mucosa and frenum attachments are dark red. Pigments such as brown, purple, black, and yellow may occur in persons of any race, but they happen more frequently in darker skinned people. 7.112.3. Acrylic resin denture base m aterial is avai lable in several differe nt shades. It can be blended to m atch the basic color of alm ost any  oral tissue. Som e manufacturers provide a shade  guide for the denture base resins they produce.  However, many dentists and technicians assem ble  Tinting a denture b ase resin is accom plished their own shade guides for a convenient reference.with various colored acrylic polymer powders. 304  7.112.4. Each of the following colored polymer powderscavity surrounding the denture teeth (Kayon® Denture Stains):  is used in a specifi c area of the m old AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 7.112.4.1. “F” (light red) for light foundation color. 7.112.4.2. “B” (brown) for dark foundation color. 7.112.4.3. “A” (medium red) for interdental papillae and sulci. 7.112.4.4. “H” (near white) for neck and eminence color. 7.112.4.5. No. 4 (dark red) for frenums and sulci adjacent to them. 7.113. Application of Tinted Resin: om 1 to 2 mm, depending on the color effect 7.113.1. The depth of the tinted veneer varies frdesired. The stains are sifted and blended around groups of three to four teeth at a time. Add drops of monomer after sprinkli ng enough loose polym er to warrant hol ding it in position. It is best to add the monomer drop by drop from a 2-cc hypodermic syringe, using a blunted 27-gauge needle.  Apply the monom er so it seeps into the polymer fr om the peripheral edge  of the stains and the wetting travels toward the teeth.  Flooding the stains with monom er causes the various colors to mix and lose their individuality. 7.113.2.

Apply the  7.113.2.1. Use “H” (near white) over labial and bupowder as a thin flashing that is barely visible (Figure 7.113). 7.113.2.2. Use “F” (light red) all over the “H” (plus m onomer). The “F” (light red) showing through the “H” gives depth to the coloring. 7.113.2.3. Use “A” (medium red) in the interseptal areas (plus monomer). 7.113.2.4. Use “H” for root em inences.

Perform the bulk of the tinting by coveri ng the open surfaces and completed areas almost to the borders with stai n “F” (plus monomer). Create thicknesses that range f rom 1 to 2 mm. Dust short red fibers into this layer from  the approximate middle of the attached gingiva  into the sulci. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 7.113. Applying Denture Base Stains. 305  7.113.2.6. Use “A” (plus monomer) for alveolar mucosa and border areas and sprinkle in a little No. 4 to accentuate frenums. 7.113.2.7. Put the tinted m old in a c overed container along with a m onomer-moistened cotton roll. Let the tinting set for 20 minutes before proceeding with the packing phase. 7.113.3. Denture base tinting for dark-skinned people is shown in Figure 7.114 and as follows:  Figure 7.114. Denture Base Tinting for Dark Skinned People.  7.113.3.1. Placing varied amounts of stain “B” (brown) satisfies most requirements. Follow the directions given for light skinned people (paragraph 7.113.2), but use stain “B” in place of stain “F,” either entirely or in part. For darker effects, black and blue stains are also available.  7.113.3.2. The most important effect is accomplished by selecting the most appropriate denture base m aterial that which will provide the b ackground shad e. The use of acrylic stains only accents features found on the m ucosa and will not  compensate for a poorly selected dentu re base shade. The use of denture base stains  alone when trying to duplicate heavily pigm ented tissue is not recommended. 7.113.3.3. If a silicone coating m aterial was used to  invest the case, it  is possible to practice tinting the flanges. The silicone material allows the tinting veneer to be removed from the mold for immediate evaluation. It is a good idea to study and practice different staining effects. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 306  Section 7U—Compression-Molded, Heat-Cured Denture Resin 7.114. Principal Kind of Resin. The principal kind of resin used for denture bases at the present time is polymethyl methacrylate. It is supplied as a m onomer (liquid) and polym er (powder) which are m ixed together in  accordan ce with m anufacturer’s instruc tions. T he resu lt is a dough-lik e m ass that can be easily shaped to fit a mold space. After the two halves of the m old are closed, th e chemical reaction between the m onomer and polym er continues to  completion. W hat was originally a pliable dough changes into solid plastic. 7.115. Chemically Activated Resins: 7.115.1. The chem ical reaction that takes p lace when  acrylic resin doug h is converted into solid , acrylic resin plastic is called  polymerization. There are two class es of  acrylic resin; heat-curing and chemically activated. The division is base d on how the monom er-polymer dough is changed into solid plastic. 7.11.5.2. W ith heat-curing acrylic re sins, polym erization takes place by a process of controlled heating. The m onomer-polymer contained in th e mold is raised to a temperatu re specified by th e manufacturer for a specific period of ti me to c reate a hard, dense, processed acrylic resin. The method of applying heat can be in the for m of water as the principal m eans of conducting heat or the use of microwave energy. 7.11.5.3. Chemically activated acrylic resins  are identified by other names like  self-curing, cold-curing, or  autopolymerizing  resin. In this case, polym erization ta kes place without the external application of heat. The m onomer portion of  a chem ically activated resin contains an addition al substance ( dimethyl  paratoluidine). This substance causes the monomer and polym er to polymerize without the need for heat to be applied to the acrylic resin. 7.115.4. Heat-curing resin is m ost commonly used for processing complete dentures in the dental laboratory. Autopolymerizing resins have more advantages (for example, less dimensional change) than heat-curing resins, and h eating equipm ent is not required for polym erization. Heat-curing acrylic resin s also hav e their own distin ct adv antages--greater color stab ility, gr eater s trength, more resistance to staining, and less absorption of oral fluids than autopolymerizing resins. 7.116. Mixing Heat-Curing Acrylic Resin. Meticulous cleanliness must be observed while mixing and packing acrylic resin to avoid introducing foreign materials into the dough. 7.116.1. The equipm ent needed for m ixing the acr ylic resin includes m onomer i mpermeable gloves, a glass m ixing jar with li d, a stainless steel m ixing spatula, and two graduated cylinders. Maintain one cylinder for monomer measurement and the other for powder. Do not switch the two and do not use a plastic graduated cylinder for the monomer. 7.116.2. In the absence of m anufacturer’s instruct ions, use one part monom er to three parts polymer. By volume, 10 cc of m onomer to 30 cc of  polymer represents the average unit measure for packing and processing one denture. CAUTION:  The use of  m anufacturer’s instructions  is critical when se lecting the curing method for the denture base m aterial. Microw ave curing of a denture base m aterial not  specifically designed fo r that app lication can  lead to po rosity, wa rpage, and in complete curing. Each manufacturer provides specific instructions and curing directions. 7.116.3. From this point on, use disposable gloves or  plastic sheets when  physically handling the resin. Using gloves protects the hands from  t he  possible health effects of handling uncured monomer, while protecting the resin from dirt and skin oils. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  307 7.116.4. Pour the monomer liquid into the jar. Sift most of the powder into the liquid. (Always add the powder to the liquid to reduce the a mount of entrapped air in the m ix.) Tap the jar on the bench top several times to bring the liquid to th e surface. Add the rem ainder of the powder. Stir, but do not whip the m ixture. Whipping the mixture increases the likelihood  of trapping air in the  acrylic resin during the m ixing process, which coul d cause difficulty in later fabrication steps. Place the lid on the mixing jar to prevent monomer evaporation during the time it takes for the mix to reach packing consistency. 7.116.5. Expect the mix to go through a series of stag es or changes in consistency. After allowing the mixture to stand for the approxim ate length of time recommended by the m anufacturer, open the jar and test the m aterial with a spatula. W hen the m ixture is no longer sticky and does not adhere to the walls of the m ixing jar, it is in  the dough stage and ready to pack into the m old. There are m any brands of heat-c ured ac rylic r esins, a nd ma nufacturer’s d irections som etimes recommend som e other indicator of packing consTherefore, it is important to read the directions and become thoroughly familiar with the material’s characteristics and behavior. 7.116.6. If acrylic resin is packed at  the sandy or stringy stage, th e material does not have enough body to pack well and will flow too readily from th e mold. Packing at too early a s tage can result in a porous denture base. Packing th e material at a very stiff stag e does not allow it to flow unde r the pressure the press generates. Delayed packing results in a loss  of denture base detail, possible  movement of the teeth, and probable opening of the occlusal vertical dimension. istency that is desira ble for their product. 7.117.  Procedures  for  Packing  Heat-Curing  Resin. The resin dough is handled with disposable gloves. The packing procedure is do ne confidently and without interr uption. To ensure success, arrange the equipment and materials in the order of use and follow these procedures: 7.117.1. Us e the following equipm ent and m aterials:  bench press, carrier press, wrench and handle, plastic sheets and gloves, and a tinfoil substitute and brush. 7.117.2. Roll the resin dough into a 1-inch diameter sa usage shape (roll) to a lign the fibers. Place the roll between two packing sheets and flatten it into a 3 mm thick slab. 7.117.3. Cut the m aterial into appropriate shapes for  the labial flange, buccal flange, and palatal areas of the m axillary mold cavity. Do the same  for the lab ial, buccal, a nd lingual flanges of the mandibular mold. Fiber alignm ent is im portant when the pieces are cut. Fibers in the labial, buccal, and  lingual flange pieces run parallel to the long axes of the teeth. Fibers in a palatal section run anterioposteriorly. Afte r placing the pieces in  the m old, there should be an excess of material (Figure 7.115-A). 7.117.4. The objective of the packing procedure is to  simultaneously have a densely filled m old and metal-to-metal contact between the flask halv es. The steps leading to this goal are called  trial packs  (Figure 7.115-B). Most heat-curi ng, denture base resins require  at least thre e trial packs before processing. In the first tria l pack, a plastic sheet is placed  between the halves of the flask. The flask is put together and hand pressure is applied to achiev e initial closure. T he flask is centered in a bench press, and the press is closed slowly (about a quarter turn every 10 seconds on a manual bench press). Slow closin g allows the resin to flow and  excess resin to escape between the flask halves. Slow closing also  creates less likelihood that the m old or denture teeth m ay be fractured or dislodged.  7.117.5. Bring the halves of the flask  to within 3 mm of m etal-to-metal contact.

Using the han dle and wrench, close the press until thcompressed and then back off a qua rter turn. This allows for the expansion of the carrier press during the curing procedure. W hen using the m icrowaveable flask, the m anufacturer normally encloses plastic nuts, bolts, and wrench to perf apply excessive force when tightening; it can cause stripping of the bolt. 7.117.9. Most dental laboratories have hydraulic or  pneumatic flask presses to m ake packing acrylic resin easier and quicker. The operation of this equipment is simple, requiring little more than a quick review of the operating instructions. However, it is importan t to m ention the  pounds per square inch (psi) of pressure  required to sufficiently close a properly  packed flask. The hydraulic flask press requires the operator to  pump the pressure handle until the pressure gauge reads between 1,000 and 1,500 psi for trial p acks. A pressure of 2,500 psi is required for final closure. Be sure not to exceed 3,000 psi. On the other hand, the pneum atic press is automated. It has preset packing pressures ofclosure. 7.117.10. Failure to adhere to the above guidelines  could result in m old distortion. Remember, the power p resses can  close qu ickly and easily fr acture cas ts or teeth if the flasks are not positioned properly. So me dentures with severe soft tissue undercuts cannot be safely packed with a power press.  1,500 psi for trial pack and 3,000 psi for final 7.118.

Flask and boil out the denture following Apply tinfoil substitute to the upper half flasking. 7.118.2. To control the thickness of the soft liner m aterial, a spacer duplicating the desired thickness of the finished soft liner is required. This can be done by one of the following methods: 7.118.2.1. Mix silicone putty m aterial and adapt it ont o the master cast to a uniform thickness of approximately 2 mm . After the material is set, remove the spacer from the m aster cast and trim excess with scissors or a bur. The finished spacer should include all peripheral borders and be uniform in thickness. 7.118.2.2. After boilout, wait until the flask has baseplate wax to the m aster cast to  act as th e spacer. Be sure there are no voidsbetween the wax and the cast. cooled and then adap t two thicknesses of   or spaces  7.118.3. Apply tinfoil s ubstitute to the lower half fl asking and allow it to dry. W ith the spacer in place, pack the heat-cu ring resin into the m old. Place p lastic over the s pacer and trial p ack the denture at least three times to ensure the mold is full. 7.118.4. Bench set the denture bas e while under pressu re until th e material becomes firm. This should take approximately 60 minutes depending on the type of denture base material. 7.118.5. Remove the wax or silicon e shim and pack the so ft liner material in its place. It is better to underpack during the first  trial pack and have to  add more material than to ove rpack initially and have to remove the denture base resin already in place. After the mold is fully packed, cure for 1 1/2 hours at 163  oF and then raise the temperature to 212 oF for 2 1/2 hours. Let the flask bench cool following curing. 7.119. Processing (Polymerizing) Heat-Curing Resin Denture Base: 7.119.1.  Overview. Heat-curing acrylic resins mpolymerization begins. Heat can be applied to ust be heated to58  oF before the flasks by using a Hanau Curing Unit (Figure  at least 1310  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 7.116) or a m icrowave oven with approved m icrowave acrylic resin. Using re sin not specifically designed f or microwave processing will yield a crylic that is porous in the th ickest areas of  the denture base. Using either of these methods will generate additional heat during polymerization. If the m onomer-polymer dough is heated to curing temperature too quickly, polym erization takes place faster. The heat of reaction can driv e the internal flask  temperature over 300  oF. Monomer boils at 212 oF, forms bubbles in the polymerizing dough, and creates unacceptable porosity in the processed denture base.   Figure 7.116. Hanau Model 2 Curing Unit.  7.119.2.  Methods  of  Polymerization. Heat-curing dentures are polym erized by the following methods and processes: 7.119.2.1. Long Cure Method: 7.119.2.1.1. Place the carrier p ress containing the flasks in  a room  temperature water bath. Heat the water slowly to 160  oF and maintain it at this temperature for 8 hours. In the water bath in which it was processed, let the flask assembly cool to room temperature.  7.119.2.1.2. To set the Hanau Model 2 curing unit (F igure 7.116) for a long cure, using the Stage 2 controls only. Set the temperature control at 160 oF and the timer for 8 hours and 45 minutes (45 minutes preheating compensation). 7.119.2.2. Short-Cure Method: 7.119.2.2.1. Place th e carrier press and flask in  a  room temperature water bath. Heat the water slowly to 160 oF and maintain at that temperature for 1 1/2 hours. Then, heat the water to 212 oF and maintain it at that temperature for 30 minutes to complete the polymerization. After polymerization, remove the flask assem bly from the water bath. Bench cool the flask assembly for 30 minutes and then cool it under running water for 20 minutes. 7.119.2.2.2. To set the Hanau Model 2 curing unit for a short-cure m ethod, set the first stage temperature control at 160 oF and the timer for 2 hours and 15  minutes. (Forty-five minutes oF equals 2 hours and 15 m inutes.) Set the second for preheating  plus 1 1/2 hours at 160 stage tem perature control for 3 hours and 10 minutes to com plete the polym erization. (Forty-five minutes preheating between 75  oF and 160  oF plus 1 1/2 hours at 160  oF plus 25 minutes preheating between 160  oF and 22  oF plus 30 minutes at 212  oF equals 3 hours and 10 minutes.) AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  311 7.119.2.3. Hanau Model 2 Curing Unit. The Hanau Model 2 curing unit is alm ost universally used in the dental laboratory  service (Figure 7.116). It provides  a positive means of controlling the rate of heating. The large volum e of water in  the unit acts as a heat  sink to dissipate the extra heat g enerated by the chem ical reacti on between the m onomer and the polym er. The  temperature in the flask m ust stay below 212  oF to prevent the m onomer from boiling. If the monomer boils, porosity of the  cured acrylic would result. Under normal conditions, the water oF per minute. If the presses and flask are temperature in a Hanau  curing unit rises about 2 placed in 75 oF (room temperature) water, the temperature reaches 160 oF in about 45 minutes. 7.119.2.4. Microwave Processing. Mirowave process ing is becom ing more widely accepted.  However, it is im portant to process only denture base m aterials sp ecially formulated for microwave processing. Using a material not designed for microwave processing will result in a porous denture base. The directions for processing dentures using the m icrowave are quite simple. Place the flask in the 500-watt m icrowave being sure to center the flask and  irradiate for 3 minutes. This will sufficiently cure the denture base material. 7.119.2.5. Flask Cooling. It is h ighly recommended that th e flasks be cooled slow ly because dimensional change in the processed denture is  smaller. When using the Hanau curing unit, the best way to cool flasks is to let the flask assembly reach room  tem perature in th e water in  which it was processed.  A less acceptable m ethod is to ben ch cool the flask assembly for 30  minutes and then place the assembly under lukewarm running water for 20 minutes. 7.120. Mixing Injection Molded Acrylic Resin:  7.120.1. This technique uses several item s specifi cally designed to acco mplish injection of polymethyl methacrylate. They are flask, insulating  sleeve, injection funnel, precapsulated acrylic resin (paragraph 7.121), acrylic m ixer and vibrat or, capsule plunger, cl amping frame, hydraulic press, injector press, and polym erization bath . The acrylic resin is supplied in premeasured capsules co ntaining exact am ounts of m onomer a nd polymer. The use of precapsulated acry lic resin eliminates the need for technicians to ha ndle unpolymerized acrylic  resin while filling the  mold--a dis tinct advan tage over tr aditional co mpression molded m ixing techn iques (par agraph 7.116).  7.120.2. During polym erization, the acrylic resin is unde r constant pressure feeding the m aterial into th e m old as it polym erizes. T his proce ss  of slowly f eeding res in into the mold during polymerization eliminates dimensional warpage due to shrinkage. 7.121. Mixing Precapsulated Acrylic Resin: 7.121.1. Remove the monomer container from the end of the acrylic injection capsule and open it by twisting off the sealed lid (Figure 7.117-A). 7.121.2. Open the capsule containing the polym er, pour the entire amount  of monomer into the injection capsule, and replace the cap. Return the  monomer container in the end of  the in jection capsule. The acrylic resin must be mixed and activated immediately  after the mono mer and  polymer are incorporated together. 7.121.3. Mount the injection  capsule to the acrylic m ixer or  vibrator by attaching the rubber securing thong. Mix the material for 5 minutes (Figure 7.117-B). 7.121.4. W hen m ixing tim e is reached, carefully in spect the acrylic resi n. W hen observing the material, lo ok f or the  a crylic r esin to be in a   ball and have no dry areas of polym er. If these conditions are not met, continue mixing the material until it reaches the correct consistency. 312  Figure 7.117. Mixing and Injecting Precapsulated Acrylic Resin. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  7.121.5. After the material is mixed, remove the empty monomer container and place the capsule  on the capsule plunger. The capsule plunger is designe d to help the technician remove all air from the injection capsule (Figure 7.117- C). It is important that no air be contai ned in the injection capsule. Failure to remove all of the air can result in voids in the processed denture base. Start by AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  pressing the capsule onto the plunger, using a sli ght rocking motion. As the  material moves to the end of the injection capsule, allow the air to escape by removing the cap. 7.122. Injecting Injection Molded Acrylic Resin: 313 essure reading from  the hydraulic press is 7.122.1. Prepare the flask for processing. Reassemble the two halves of the flask with the injection funnel and insulating sleeve position ed in the en d of the flask. Place the entire assem bly into th e clamping frame (Figure 7.117-D). 7.122.2. Place the flask and clam ping frame into the hydraulic press. The clamping ratchet should be in the upright position in the press (Figure 7.117-E). 7.122.3. Push the clamp lever to the right while applying pressure to the flask and clamping fra me until 80 bars of pressure is indicated on the pressure gauge. As pressure is applied, the ratchet will engage the locking m echanism and m aintain the   desired pressure. The ratchet m ust engage the locking m echanism to guarantee the 80-bar prmaintained during processing. 7.122.4. Remove the plug from the end of the injection capsule containing the mixed acrylic resin. Push the ca psule in to the insulatin g sleeve loc ated in the end of the flask until it engages the injection funnel (Figure 7.117-F). 7.122.5. Mount the pressure apparatus on the neck of  the flask and move the locking ring down to secure the apparatus to the flask. The pressu re apparatus is designed to maintain constant pressure of fluid resin during polym erization and will re quire an a ir pressure so urce. Ensure the plung er from the pressure apparatus properly engages the injection capsule (Figure 7.117-G). 7.122.6. Start the injection of resin and polymerizassure to the  injection capsule. This can be accurately measured by observing the pressure gauge located on the end of the pressure apparatus (Figure 7.117-H). A llow the case to bench set under pressure for 5 minutes. NOTE: Acrylic resin that has been in a m ixed state for several hours will require a 10-minute injection tim e. Acrylic resi n left over from previous proces sings can be reus ed for cases processed later, thereby reducing wasted material. 7.122.7. Place the clamping fram e into the preheated 212  oF polymerization bath (Figure7.117-I). The water level in the polym erization bath  m ust reach  the lin e lo cated on th e ex terior of the  clamping frame. The specified water level p rovides for a more contro lled polymerization of the acrylic resin within the flask. When placing the clamping frame into the bath, be careful not to trap and subm erge any plastic floats. The plastic fl heat insu lators for the polymerization bath. If trapped betw een the cl amping frame and bottom of the tank, they could melt. 7.122.8. The water level must reach the line indicated on the clamping frame and remain at 212 oF for the en tire pro cessing period  of  35 m inutes. Never in terrupt the  b oiling or po lymerization procedure by introducing other flasks into the  polymerization bath. The proper processing time  must be observed and the flask m ust not stay in the processing bath  longer than the prescribed 35 minutes. If flasks are p rocessed longer than the designated tim e, excess resin in the injection capsule could polymerize. 7.122.9. The final step in the polym erization process is controlled co oling of the acrylic resin to suspend further polymerization of the excess resin in the injection cylinder. Using the air pressure shutoff valve located at the top of the pressure a pparatus, move the valve to the closed position. It is now possible to disconnect the air supply line  from the apparatus and move the entire assem bly to the cooling bath while m aintaining 6 bars of  pressure on the cooling acrylic resin. During the tion by applying 6 bars of preoats are used as314  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 of pressu re m ust be m aintained to continu e first 20 m inutes of the cooling phase, the 6 bars feeding resin to the coo ling acrylic resin. After the initial 20 minutes of pressurized cooling time, the air valve may be opened to release the pressure and the apparatus may be removed for the final 10 minutes of cooling time. The total cooling time is 30 minutes. 7.123. Mixing and Pouring Acrylic Resin: 7.123.1. To properly m ix the acrylic resin, you w ill need m onomer and poly mer m easuring cylinders that are only  used for liquid pour resin m aterial, an acrylic m ixing jar, and an acrylic mixing spatula. 7.123.2. The m ixing ratio is 2.5 cc polym er to 1  cc monomer. When m ixing the monom er a nd polymer, proper m ixing ratios m ust be observed b ecause excessive sh rinkage could result du ring curing from excess monomer. 7.123.3. Place the appropriate am ount of monomer in an acrylic mixing jar and slowly sift in the  polymer (30 cc polym er to 12 cc m onomer for a com plete denture) and m ix for 8 to 10 seconds. The acrylic resin m ust be poured into the m old within 3 m inutes. When pouring RPDs, take care not to pour resin into the vent sprues. 7.123.4. Pour acrylic resin into the pouring spru e (Figure 7.118-A). When pouring, observe the vent sprues and watch f or the presence of resin. As the resin f ills the mold, it will d rive air from the mold out the vent sprue. When the vent sprues become filled, stop filling the mold and slightly rock the flask from  side to side to help di slodge any air rem aining in the flask (Figure 7.118-B) . NOTE: Take care not to tap the flask on the bench top or rock the flask m ore than 90 degrees. Failure to observe these precautions could result in denture tooth dislodgment.  Figure 7.118. Pouring and Processing Acrylic Resin.  7.124. Processing and Pouring Acrylic Resin: 7.124.1. Bench set the case sprue hole s up for 3 to 5 m inutes. Before processing the case in the pressure pot, the acrylic resin must be allowed to reach its optimum processing consistency. When the sprues have lost their gloss or sheen, the cast is ready to be processed. 7.124.2. Place one inch of 100 to 120 oF water in the pressure pot. 7.124.3.

Apply 20 pounds of air pressure and allow to set for 30 minutes to complete processing of the acrylic resin. 7.125. Removable Prosthesis Identification: 7.125.1. Requirements: 7.125.1.1. In relation to dentistry, the subject of forensics is increasing in im portance. Many shortcomings in person nel iden tification hav e surfaced as  a resu lt of findings during m ass casualty identifications. There are fewer problems when removable  dentures have the wearer’ s identification. 7.125.1.2. Every completed removable prosthodontic appliance  must carry the social security number (SSN) of the patient. The only exception  to using the full number is when physiologic, esthetic, or space considerations lim it its use. In that case, use as many term inal digits as  possible. To  be usef ul, the iden tification m ust be legib le. I n all ins tances, the id entification procedure should be done at the local level where the proper SSN of th e patient is easily verified. NOTE: An all-metal partial denture must have the patient’s SSN carefully engraved in metal in an appropriate area. 7.125.2. Paper Strip Technique: 7.125.2.1. Use this technique only during resin packing procedures. 7.125.2.2. Type the patient’s SSN on a piece of absorbent p aper sheet (for example, onion skin paper). 7.125.2.3. Before the last tria l pack and using an instrum ent, displace the acryli c resin in an area where subsequent denture base adjustm ents are unlikely. The prep ared area should be approximately 1.5 mm deep and long enough to accommodate the prepared SSN identification. 7.125.2.4. Trim off the excess paper around the patien t’s SSN and place the paper strip in th e prepared area. Wet the strip with monomer. 7.125.2.5. Mix clear orthodontic polym er or Class  A monomer in a sm all dappen dish, cover with plastic sheet, and allow to reach packing consistency. Apply th e prepared orthodontic resin and ac complish the f inal trial pack procedure. Be  sure to in spect the SSN prio r to f inal closure of the flask. 7.125.2.6. Proceed  with  the final closure.  NOTE: If a red ucing copy  m achine is available,  reduce the patient’s SSN so the label can be used in a limited area. 7.125.3. Shrinking Plastic Technique. Many dentists and technicians prefer to use a shrinking plastic sheet (for example, Shrinky Dinks® by Color Forms, Ramsey, NJ) for removable prosthesis identification. The material shrinks to one-third of the original size, yet increases in thickness nine times, m aking it idea l when space  is lim ited. The  shrinking plastic technique is not lim ited to preprocessing use, but m ay be used for post-processing as well. Because RPDs are packed differently from complete dentures, the only chance to perform the prosthesis identification is after the RPD is  finished.  Pre-pro cessing procedu res  using the shrinking plas tic mat erial ar e very similar to those described in the paper striprocedures are detailed (as follows): p technique; therefore, only the post-processing 7.125.3.1.

Type the patient’s SSN on a piece of the sh rinking plastic sheet and  trim the excess plastic away from around the SSN. 7.125.3.3. Using a pair o f hemostats, lightly pass the material over a bunsen burner flame until the material undergoes its shrinking process. 7.125.3.4. In an appropriate area of the denture base, cut a shallow recess that is deep enough to recess the identification label (F igure 7.119-A). Grind the back of  it to reduce the thickness of  the label.  Figure 7.119. Removable Prosthesis Identification. 316   7.125.3.5. Use the brush technique of adding  autopolymerizing acrylic because it works best with this type procedure. In one dappen dish,  place a small amount of monomer; place a small portion of clear polymer in another. Place the identification label in the recess. Dip the tip of an investment painting brush into the monomer and wet the recessed area and label. Dip the brush again in monomer and then dip the wet brush in the center of the powder in the dappen dish. Do not let the brush touch the side of the dish because monomer may leak down the side and cause the rest of the powder to be unusable. 7.125.3.6. Pick up a sm all a mount of polym er on th e brush tip and apply it to the label. Continue to repeat this step until the clear overlayer is slightly raised. oF water at 20 psi for 30 7.125.3.7.

E nsure the denture flask and its contents have reached room   temperature before deflasking. Equipm ent needed includes a plaster knife, two chisels, flask ejector unit, and plaster saw. 7.127. Removing the Investment Mold and Denture From the Flask: is to rem ove the denture from the asking procedure 7.127.1. Make sure the flask is cool. Remove the lid of the flask with a plaster knife (Figure 7.120-A). Place the flask in the ejecto r unit with  the knockout plate up. Close the unit and pass the chisels through the holes in the si des of the ejector into the slot s between the two halves of the  flask. Using inward and  downward pressur e, apply force until the ha lves of the f lask come apart AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  317 (Figure 7.120-B). The chisels act as levers, and the  sides of the ejector unit are the fulcrum s. Pull the handles of the chisels up in the other direction to separate the mold from the flask. 7.127.2. When using the hydrocolloid investm ent technique, it is as sim ple as cutting away the  solidified hydrocolloid after final polym erization. W hen using the inje ction flask, place the clamping frame on the hydraulic press to allow rel ease of the ratchet. When  the ratchet has been released, the flask should slide easily from the clamping frame.

Use the steps in 7.128. Removing the Denture and Cast From the Investment Mold: left canine areas and at the right7.128.1. Pry off the occlusion cap to expose the cusp  tips and incisal edges  of the denture teeth (Figure 7.120-D). In the right and  and left distal ends, cut the  outer walls of the stone mold with a plaster saw from top to bottom. Do not saw into the denture. 7.128.2. Pry the section ed stone mold away fro m the  facial surfaces of the  denture with a plaster knife (Figure 7.120-E and -F). Before try ing to re move the investing stone from  the m axillary palatal area or mandibular tongue space, trim the stone away from the lingual surfaces of the teeth (Figure 7.120-G). This trimm ing helps reduce the po ssibility of the dentur e lifting off the cast when the inner portion of the mold is removed and also guards against fracturing the denture teeth. 7.128.3. Take out the inner section of the m axillary or m andibular mold in a way that does not dislodge the denture from  the cas t (Figure 7.120-H). Rem ove the th in shell of stone covering the base of the cast and indexing grooves. Rem ove  all  debris  from the grooves. Clean away any remaining plastic bubbles or dental stone residue from around the denture teeth (Figure 7.120-I).  7.128.4. After deflasking, leave the denture firm ly seated on its cast. If there  is the slightest trace of wobble or other evidence that the denture has come loose from the cast, the dentist must decide if the case can be transfe rred to the articulator for rem ount. Do  not shellblast a denture on a cast during the deflasking procedure. The high pressure  air blast lifts the denture off the cast. Shells  wedged between the denture and the  cast prevents the denture from ever going back to its original position. Accurate remounting is impossible under these conditions. Section 7W—Correcting Changes Between Occlusal Surfaces and Incisal Edges 7.129.  Overview.  Remounting complete dentures  (Section 7X), with subsequent occlusal grinding (Sections 7Y and 7Z), corrects  any changes in the con tact relation of the occlusal surfaces an d incisal edges of the teeth that mpolymerization of the denture base. l w axing, investing, packing, and ight have occurred during the finacative of good packing and pr7.129.1. The change that is most typical of compression molded, heat-cured dentures is an increase in the occlusal vertical dim ension. Increases  of more than 0.25 - 0.50 mm per single denture are not acceptable and  are not indiocessing techniques. Another processing change occurs if the denture teeth shift position in relation to each other. 7.129.2. Changes can happen for many reasons. All ba seplate waxes are som ewhat unstable and denture teeth drift in a wax tria l denture. Setting expansion of the ston e used to flask the wax  denture contributes to tooth m ovement.

To elim inate interferences (high spots, defl ective contacts, or prem aturities), they first have to be found. The selective grinding process has  strict rules. Those rule s represent a precise, orderly way of  using ar ticulating paper to iden tify prematurities and e liminate them. The rea lly gross interferences are seen as white spots surrounded by carbon rings (Figure 7.122-A). This kind of mark shows a contact so heavy that the cusp has cut through the articulating paper. 7.131.3. As a few m ore contacts begin to devel op, the prem aturities ta ke the appearance of isolated, so lid dark sp ots or tracks.

Major Steps. The major steps are to correct th e vertical processing error and restore the centric occlusion (paragraph 7.134), correct the working and balancing occlusion (paragraph 7.135), correct the protrusive occlusion (paragraph 7.136), polish the  selectively ground denture  teeth (paragraph 7.137), and mill-in the dentures (paragraph 7.138).  320  Figure 7.122.

Ensure  the readings on the articu lator are the same as when the denture teeth were set  in wax. Also, ensure the condylar  elements of the  articulator are locked against the cen tric stops and  the incis al guide pin is  at the sam e setting as when the case was final waxed. 7.134.2. Evaluate the compensating curve. A ll cusp tips of the processed denture  should be on the compensating curve establish ed in the wax dent ure. Packing and processing forces can m ove individual denture  teeth grossly out of position. If a m axillary cusp tip is obviously protruding below the curve or a mandibular cusp tip is significantly above the curve,  grind those cups tips carefully to conform to the curve. NOTE: Do not use this step to reorient or “touch up “ an entire compensating curve; use it only on an isolated tooth that has clearly migrated out of line. 7.134.3. Check the am ount of opening between the in cisal guide pin and th e guide table (Figure 7.123). In a set of opposing com plete dentures, a pi n opening of 1 mm i s the lim it of reasonable acceptability. Beyond that point, ev ery bit of opening  requires that much more selective grinding  with consequent destruction of denture tooth anatomy. If 2 mm pin opening is present and isolated migration of a tooth is not rehing more to the  case  witho ut consulting the dentist. 7.134.4.

Clo se the articulator and on ly poin ts of contact between the denture teeth will transcribe marks from one arch to the other. This technique will very accurately show the areas of true contact. 7.134.5. Technicians are often m isguided by faulty  occlusal m arkings. For example, if the maxillary denture was designated with red and the mandibular with black, then any contacts of the opposite color located on the arch would be points  of true contact. Make  corrections by grinding fossae, proximal marginal ridges, and cusp inclines m arked by articu lating paper. Do not grind cusp  tips  during  this  step. Repeat th is procedu re until the in cisal guide pin touches  the inc isal guide table (Figure 7.124).  7.134.6. For the next step, rem ove the articulator  paper markings with a cotton tip applicator moistened with m onomer. Place bl ack articulating p aper on the righ t and left sid es and tap the denture teeth together. With the pin touching the table, there should be multiple, evenly distributed points of contact between m axillary and m andibular teeth (Figur e 7.125).

Pin Opening. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  7.135. Correcting the Working and Balancing Occlusion:  7.135.1. Two paths of travel are possible when newly remounted dentures are moved into working and balancing relations. One is a path which the  upper and lower teeth m esh best; the second is a path governed by the way articulator settings guide the upper member through lateral movements. (The teeth may or may not mesh well.) After wa xing the dentures and s ubsequent processing, the two paths should be the same. 7.135.2. An assum ption in the selective grinding pro cedure is that processi ng the denture base shifted the teeth into slightly incorrect positions. After remount,  there may be a path where the teeth mesh together r ather well, but this “too th-guided” path is totally  unreliable f or correcting interferences between denture te eth along that path. Instead, depe nd on the path dictated by the articulator settings as the standard. 7.135.3. When correcting working and  balancing occlusion, the objec tive is to once again m ake the tooth guided lateral paths and th e articulator guided lateral paths coincide. The way in which the articulator is manipulated is crucial to success. Every bit of sideshift at a given lateral condylar guidance setting  m ust be inco rporated into  ea ch lateral move ment. (S ee paragraph 6.21 for a description of the proper way to produce a lateral movement in a Hanau H2 articulator.) To correct the occlusion in eccentric positions: 7.135.3.1. Lock down the working side condyle and re lease the balancing si de condyle. Place  red  articulating paper on the right and left sider into  a latera l excursion, being sure to incorporate sideshift. Do not let the  denture teeth guide the movement.

On the working side, check for working mandibular anterior teeth that prevent posteriinterference exists, grind the facioincisal surface of the offendi ng lower anterior or the lingual  surface of the m axillary anterior teeth. Next, follow the buccal of the u pper and lingual of the lower (BULL) rule on the working side.

NOTE: The BULL rule only applie s to the working side. Do not grind any other marks on the working side that are not a part of the rule. 7.135.3.3. On the balancing side, note that the only  contacts possible occur between the buccal inclines of lingual cusps on m axillary teeth and the linmandibular teeth. The rule on the balancing side  is to grind articulating paper m arks found on gual  inclines of buccal cusps of AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  325 ing side corrections together. For example, placeinclines and cusp tips associated with the bu ccal cusps of the m andibular teeth. Dis regard all other marks on the balancing side. 7.135.3.4. Perform  working and balanc articulating paper between the maxillary and mandibular teeth on the right and left sides, move the upper member of the articulator into a late ral excursion, perform the indicated working and balancing side corrections, and repeat the previous three steps in sequence until num erous, well-distributed working and balancing side cont acts develop. The practical lim it of a lateral excursion test movement is cusp ridge contact. 7.135.3.5. Figures 7.126 and 7.127 show the possible pattern s of marks for right and left lateral excursion. Use these figures as guides in the selective grinding procedur e. Start with a right lateral excursion (Figure 7.126). T hen follow thes e steps: (1) Lock down the right condylar element and release the left element; (2) Place red articulating paper between the maxillary and mandibular teeth on the right and ral excursion--the right side becom es the working  side; and (4) Grind prem ature spots and track s using Figure 7.126 as a guide. (Notice that the figure conforms to the BULL and balancing side rules; that is, buccal of the upper and lingual of the lower on the working side and buccal of the lower on the balancing side.) Disregard all other marks.  7.135.3.6. Continually repeat steps 2 through 4 aresembles the figure develops on the working and  balancing sides. After selective grinding has been performed for a right latera l excursion, perform the procedure for a left lateral excursion, using Figure 7.127 as a guide. bove until a general contact pattern that left sides; (3) Move the articulator into a right late7.136. Correcting the Protrusive Occlusion. To correct protrusive interferences, grind the app ropriate inclines, but do not reduce the heights of any of the cusps. Also, the practical lim it of a pr otrusive excursion is when the incisors are edge to edg e and  the posteriors are just shor t of a cusp to cusp tip relationship. When correcting protrusive occlusion, the following two conditions are possible: 7.136.1. Contact between the upper and lower antericontact. Grind the  facioincisal surfaces of the m andibular anterior. As a last resort , modify the lingual surfaces and  incisal edges of maxillary anterior teeth. 7.136.2. Contact between the upper and  lower posterior teeth with no  anterior contact. Grind the  distal inclines of interfering maxillary buccal cusps and pre mature mesial inclines on mandibular lingual cusps. ors with no posterior 7.137. Polishing Selectively Ground Denture Teeth. Use rubber points impregnated with carborundum grit to sm ooth over cusp and fossa irregularities.  To get a high polish on denture teeth, use flour of pumice and a fine ab rasive commercial agent (for exam ple, Tru-Polish ® #3 by Dentsply, Inc). W hen polishing selectively ground denture  teeth, do not destroy the details of  the occlusal surfaces. Recheck the occlusal contacts prior to proceeding with the st eps in paragraph 7.138. Be pa rticularly careful with plastic teeth. 7.138. Milling-In the Occlusion. This is the process of covering the  occlusal surfaces of the teeth with abrasive paste and, with the teeth in contact, rubbing off any remaining, small interferences. For mill-in procedures, perform the following steps sequentially: 7.138.1. Raise the incisal guide pin a bove the incisal guide table. Re lease the centric locks so the upper member of the articulator moves freely.  326  Figure 7.126. Selective Grinding--Right Lateral Excursion. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005   7.138.2. Place abrasive paste on the occlusal surfaces of the teeth. 7.138.3. Slide the articulator from the centric occlusion to the right lateral position and back about five times. Perform the same movements to the left. 7.138.4. Move the dentures from the centric occlusi on into the protrusive position and back about five times. 7.138.5. Perform the above steps in sequence about three or four times. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 7.127. Selective Grinding--Left Lateral Excursion. 327  Section 7Z—Selective Grinding of Monoplane Complete Dentures 7.139. Procedures: 7.139.1. The objective in setting 0 de gree teeth on a m onoplane is to make the monoplane as flat as possible. That goal may be achieved in the  wax-up, but processing changes require touching up irregularities that inevitably develop. 7.139.2. The rule in selectively gri nding monoplane denture occlusions is to flatten the occlusal plane of one arch and then adjust the teeth in the other arch against that standard. After remounting the case, check the amount of the pin opening. If it is more than 2 mm, consult with the dentist. 7.139.3. Because the m andibular teeth are alm ost set on  a flat plane, p ick the mandibular arch as  the f irst a rch to ad just. A f lat alu minum plat e helps  detect teeth  th at do not confor m to the monoplane. 328  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 ch form, alum inum oxide transfers to the  7.139.4. When the plate is rubbed across the entire artooth surfaces and m arks the high  spots. Reduce the high spots with  the flat edge of an abrasive  wheel mounted in a straight handpiece. (A handpiece  gives infinitely more contro l than a lathe.) When the occlusal plane of the  mandibular arch is flat, do not  touch it again. Lock the condylar elements against the centric stops.  7.139.5. Another technique requires rem oving the  mandibular cast from  the articulator and sanding the occlusal surfaces of acrylic teeth against a sheet of 320-grit wet or dry sandpaper held flat against a glass slab. Perform all remaining corrections on the maxillary teeth. Always use two pieces of articulating paper, one on the right and the other on the left to find the high spots. 7.139.6. Continue to grind until the incisal gu ide pi n m eets the tab le. Be sure to m aintain a generally flat plane among all maxillary posteriors. NOTE: When grinding a high spot, do not just zero in on that place. If ditching and creation of pos terior vertical overlap are to be avoided, grind the immediate area around the high spot.  Section 7AA—Remounting Index 7.140. Constructing a Remounting Index: 7.140.1. When a dentist has the m axillary cast mount ed with a facebo w transfer, he or she w ill probably request a rem ounting index. The ind ex is a perm anent record of the facebow tran sfer. Using this index, a f inished maxillary complete denture that has been se parated from its origin al mounting can be remounted as if another facebow transfer has been made. 7.140.2. The usual reas on for re mounting a finished denture is a need for additional occlusal correction after the denture has been checked in  the patient’s m outh. Make a remounting index after com pleting a ll s elective grind ing corr ections, but before separating the denture from  its master cast and original mounting (Figure 7.128).  Figure 7.128. Fabricating a Remounting Index.  7.141. Procedures for a Remounting Index: 7.141.1. Use a remounting jig or a cylinder of boxi ng wax shaped around a m ounting plate on the lower member to suppo rt a m ix of a ccelerated dental stone. Make the su rface of the m ix capture only the incisal edges of the anterior teeth and th e occlusal surfaces and cusp tips of the posterior  teeth of the maxillary teeth when the articulator is closed. Ensure the occlusal surfaces and incisal AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  329 edges of the maxillary teeth are registered as shallow indentations in the soft stone. Take care not to lock the denture teeth in the index to prevent  fracture of the teeth or de stroying the accuracy of the index. After the dental stone sets, put the index aside for possible future use. 7.141.2. Recover the dentures from  their m aster  casts (paragraph 7.145)  and perform  routine  finishing and polishing procedures (Section 7A B). To prevent the acrylic resin from drying and subsequently undergoing dim ensional changes a nd warping, place the dedenture bag prior to delivery to the dentist. ntures into a m oist 7.142.  Use  of  a  Remounting  Index. Have the dentis t place the com pleted den tures in th e patien t’s mouth and evaluate them. If the teet h do not come together satisfactorily, the dentist will often ask for a denture remount with subsequent correction of the occlusion on the articulator. To do a remount without access to an  index, the dentist m ust supply a new centr ic relation reco rd and facebow transfer. If an  index is av ailable that duplicates  a prio r faceb ow tr ansfer, there is no  reason  to  do another transfe r procedures. First, m ake  remounting  casts.  Then rem ount the m axillary cast (us ing the previously  prepared index) and mandibular cast (using the new record of centric relation) (Figure 7.129). 7.143. Fabricating a Remounting Cast:  7.143.1. Because master casts are destroyed during denture recovery, construction of a remounting cast should make the remount procedure easier.  In a good remounting cast, the denture com es off the cast easily and seats on the cast with no trace of wobble. 7.143.2. To meet these goals, make a cast that accurately reproduces all of a denture’s borders. Fill in all undercuts in the tissue surface of denture  with wet paper towel m aterial, polyvinylsiloxane putty, or a sim ilar material (Figure 7.129-A). Invert the denture ont o a mount of wet plaster, and make sure the border coverage is adequate but not excessive (Figure 7.129-B). After the stone sets, trim it into the form of a cast and key the base (Figure 7.129-C). 7.144. Remounting Dentures With an Index and a Remounting Cast: 7.144.1. Use sticky wax to fasten the m axillary and mandibular dentures to their remounting casts (Figure 7.129-D). Place the index in  position on the articulator’s  lower member. Firmly seat the maxillary denture teeth in the indentations and use a mix of accelerated stone to attach the cast to the upper member (Figure 7.129-E and -F). 7.144.2. Aft er mounting the m axillary cast, rem ove the index and invert the articu lator onto an inversion s tand if  nec essary. Som e articu lators are  m anufactured to  allow the  low er m ounting procedure to be accomplished without an inversion stand. 7.144.3. Fit the dentures into the ce ntric relation record the dentis t provides. Stabilize the entire  assembly with pieces of coat  hangar wire attached with compound to the proximal surfaces of the base of the cast. (Usually three rods are sufficient.) Do not use tongue blades, cotton swabs, or any other wood products when stabilizing the casts. When stone is added to the base of the cast, it may come into contact with the wood, causing the w ood to expand and thereby altering the occlusal relation of the dentures to be mounted. 7.144.4. Open the incisal guide pin by  an amount estimated to equal  the thickness of the record. Attach the mandibular cast to the lower m ounting plate. After the stone sets, loosen the guide pin and close the denture teeth into contact.  330  Figure 7.129. Remounting a Maxillary Denture With an Index. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Section 7AB—Recovering, Finishing, Polishing, and Caring for Complete Dentures 7.145.  Recovering  a  Processed  Denture  From  the  Master  Cast. Most dentures  are undercut in varying amounts. Breakage or distortion of the denture is inevitable if an attempt is made to pry it off its processing (master) cast. Undercuts on the upper dent ure are m ost commonly f ound beneath the labial flanges, and less frequently in the tuberosity areas. Mandibular denture undercuts are most often located in the lingual flange regions bilaterally and under the labial flanges, anteriorly. Undercut casts must be sectioned with a saw to remove individual smaller pieces as careful as possible. 7.145.1. Equipment and Materials. Equipment and materials and their order of use are a plas ter saw and blades, a pneumatic chisel, a shell blaster, and sodium citrate solution (or a commercially available stone remover). 7.145.2. Denture Recovery Procedures: 7.145.2.1. Recovering a denture from  its processing cast requires c onsiderable care in sawing and a practical s ense of where and how to appl y pressure in dislodg ing the p ieces. Make th e initial cuts with a plas ter saw and remove the segments by gently wedging a knife blade in the cut. Figure 7.130 shows the sequence to follow when removing the different segm ents of maxillary and mandibular casts. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 7.130. Denture Recovery--Suggested Sequence of Cuts and Fragment Removal. 331  7.145.2.2. When using a plaster saw, it  is very easy to cut into the  resin without being aware of it. One way to improve visibility is to saw the  cast under a stream of water and flush the debris away as the cut deepen s. Saw a short distance, remove the saw from t he cut, and check for depth. Pay special attention to a maxillary denture with a h igh vault. Because the palate could be the same height or in som e cases slightly hi gher than the peripheral borders of the denture, inattention could cause irreparable damage to the newly fabricated denture. 7.145.2.3. After removing the bulk of  the base of the cast,  use a small pneumatic chisel to cut out the pieces that rem ain in ridge areas (Fig ure 7.131). Do not let the pneum atic chisel come  into contact with the newly process ed denture ba se because chipping or even a fracture of th e acrylic resin could result.  Figure 7.131.

Use a shell blaster to clean away the lastblaster blows a high pressure jet  of walnut shell particles, but  it is not intended for rem oving large masses of stone.) To prevent warping or burning the denture resin, do not hold the denture closer than 4 inches fro m the blaster’s nozzle.  As an added precau tion, keep the p iece of work moving while it is under the shell stream. 7.145.2.5. Soak a recovered denture in sodium citrate or one of the c ommercially available stone remover solutions to d issolve away th e last traces of  stone that m ay have been m issed with the blaster. 7.146. Finishing Complete Dentures. Finishing is the process of contouring  the denture to the desired shape and thickness (Figure 7.132). Only  a little finishing is required  if the final w ax-up was carefully waxed, packed, and polymerized. 7.146.1. Use abrasive m aterials to finish com plete  dentures, but never appl y an abrasive to the  tissue surfaces of a denture unless directed by the dentist to do so. from the peripheries  of the denture using 7.146.2. Remove all flash and sharp edges of resin carbide denture burs and stones specially made for finishing acrylic resin (Figure 7.132-A). Do not alter the height or width of a peripheral roll during this procedure. It is often more effective for the cautious tec hnician to u se a red wa x pencil to  trace out th e area to b e tr immed. Of ten subtle  changes in the peripheral contour can be mcompensate for the following polishing steps, asremoval by pumice and polish: issed and overtrimm ing can  result. Take care to  required, and leave a very sm all am ount for  7.146.2.1. Cut or carefully grind away resin bubb les from all surfaces (Figure 7.132-B). Check  the interior of the denture caref ully with a finger to locate  any nodules of acrylic resin and consult the dentist if relief is required. Re move any flash from around the necks of the teeth with right and left denture-trimm ing chisels. The denture resin that represents the free gingival margin should be about 1 mm thick and rounded in all directions. 7.146.2.2. Smooth the em inence contours at  the base of the denture  teeth with th e appropriate grade of finishing m aterial (for example, acr ylic bur, stone, or rubbe r point) (Figure 7.132-C). If necessary, continue shaping and smoothing the  denture surfaces out to the facial and lingual borders. Rem ember, the tim e spent preparing th e acrylic resin for polishing now m eans the  anatomical detail placed in the denture base is less likely to be pumiced away. 7.147. Polishing Complete Dentures. The polishing procedure rem oves all scratches from the denture base and produces a generally glossy finish (F igure 7.132-D through -L). After polishing, the denture tends to accum ulate less food debr is, is easier to  clean, and becom es m ore stain resistant. Polished surfaces feel better to a patient’s tongue and are less likely to irritate other surrounding soft tissues. 7.147.1. A series of progressiv ely finer abrasive  agents will be used to produce the required ) Each of t he denture base gloss. (A highly reflective, m irror-like appearance is not desirable.wheels and brushes used to apply these agents is ass igned for use  with a spec ific agent. Do not mix brushes and wheels with different types of ab rasives. During polishing, keep the denture base moving. Hold the denture firmly and do not press against a wheel too hard or the resin will get hot and scorch. Use adequate protective equipment. Always stay alert to potential hazards. 7.147.2. Protect the denture that has  acrylic resin teeth from  abrasive action. Cover the facial and lingual surfaces of the teeth with adhesive tape. Begin polishing the denture base with wet pumice applied to a course black brush wheel. Carefully  smooth the interproximal areas and the gingival trim areas. Control the location of  the brush wheel and be sure to  keep it m oving. If the wheel is allowed to remain in any one place for long periods of time, scorching of the resin could result. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 7.132.

If an anatomical palate has been placed in the denture, care  must be taken to prevent elimination of the contours.  7.147.4. Aft er com pletion of the palate, proceed to the buccal surfaces  of the m axillary, or mandibular dentures and the lingual flange secti ons of the m andibular denture. Begin by working from firm pressure to light pres sure. A lot of pum icing should not  be necessary if care was taken in the wax-up stage. Usually one pass over the eminences is sufficient. 7.147.5. Finish the bulk polishing of the denture base with a rag wheel running at low speed. Used properly, th is wheel can reach alperipheral borders, deep lingual flanges, and the termination point of the maxillary denture at the post palatal seal. 7.147.6. Rinse the pum ice from the dentures and insppresent, remove them with a rubber point and resmoothness of the resin is satisfactory, rempumicing. 7.147.7. Often, denture teeth can be scratched or dulled as a result of shell blasting. To remove the fine abrasions use a sof t white b ristle brush wheel.  Lightly pumice over the teeth and the en tire denture, taking care not to polish away the surface anatomy of the teeth or the acrylic resin denture base. 7.147.8. Next, polish the denture w ith  tripoli  on a different set of wheels and brushes. At this stage, inspect the dentu re for scratches and irre gularities not visible dur ing the pumice stag e and repeat earlier steps of pum icing and polish with  tripoli until the desired  smoothness is attained . Remember that the success of each polishing s tep is determined by the step before it, so atten tion to detail is critical for complete success. 7.147.9. Complete the f inal polishing of the denture  base using a soft, dry rag wheel im pregnated with commercial polishing compound and formulated for acrylic resin. 7.147.10. Use soap and water to scrub all polishing  compound residue from the denture surfaces.

To prevent the acrylic resin   from drying and subsequently undergoing dim ensional changes and warping, place the dentures in to a m oist denture bag prior to  delivery to the dentist. If mailing the dentures to another clinic, ship them in a plastic bag that contains a sufficient amount of water to keep  the dentures m oist.

Section 7AC—Maxillary Complete Denture Opposing a Natural Dentition  7.150. Overview. A maxillary denture opposing natural teeth requires changes to standard procedures in denture fabrication (Figure 7.133). The objective of this section is to identify those changes. 336  Figure 7.133. Maxillary Complete Denture Opposing a Natural Dentition. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  7.151. Casts. It is a good idea to pour the teeth on the m andibular cast in a low f using metal to reduce wear and  p ossible fracture of th e cast’s  surface. If  low f using m etal is not av ailable, dental stone is adequate. (The use of a stone hardener is also an option if no low fusing metal is available.) 7.152.  Mounting  the  Lower  Cast. The dentist will provide a jaw  rela tionship record with tooth  indentations of cusp tips and inci sal edges only. Trying to jam  an opposing cast into a jaw relationship record that laps onto the facial and lingual surface of  the teeth will lead to gr oss mounting inaccuracies. If a record shows a lot more than cusp tips and incisal edges, take a razor-sharp blade and carefully trim back the record until nothing but cusp  tip and incisal edge indentations  remain. When a cast of natural teeth is positioned against a jaw re lationship record, it m ust be trim med to see exactly where cusp tips and incisal edges are supposed to fit. 7.153. Denture Tooth Selection. Use plastic, cusped teeth to oppose  natural teeth. Particularly in older individuals, natural teeth  tend to be worn and have flattened o cclusal surfaces. Teeth with  lower cusp angles, such as 20-degree teeth, may articulate better with worn, natural teeth. 7.154. Denture Tooth Arrangement: 7.154.1. The occlusion scheme for dentures of this kind will be made with the mandatory multiple, well-distributed contacts in centric  occlusion. Tooth contacts in la teral and protrusive excursions AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  337  to achieve. Therefore, dentist who wants m ore characteristic of a balanced denture are difficultcontacts should give specific directions. 7.154.2. Most dentists provide detailed instructions on how the anterior teeth are to be set. Arrange the teeth for maximum esthetic value. Incorporate an acceptable amount of vertical and horizontal overlap. Increasing  the vertical  overlap usually im proves the app earance of an anterior too th arrangement. It is also true that the chances fo r lateral and protrusive excursion balance tend to diminish as vertical overlap increas es. An “acc eptable” compromise needs to b e drawn between these two considerations based on the dentist’s decisions. 7.154.3. When a denture is m ade to function agains t existing natural teet h, minor natural tooth irregularities usually prevent de velopment of the best possible cen tric occlusion. To com pensate for inadequate or marginally adequate posterior tooth occlusion: 7.154.3.1. Open the occlusal vertical dimension about 1.0 mm on the articulator. 7.154.3.2. Set the posterior denture teeth in the best centric occlusion possible. 7.154.3.3. Surround the posterior teeth with enough wax to make them stable. 7.154.3.4. Clean any wax drippings from the occlusal surfaces. 7.154.3.5. Put the incisal guide pin back at its original setting. (This places the pin 1 mm off the guide table.) 7.154.3.6. Use a handpiece, tap ered 203 stone, and #6  ball diamond to  selectively grind the posterior teeth for the centric occlusion position until the pin meets the table.  Section 7AD—Immediate Dentures 7.155. Overview: 7.155.1. An i mmediate denture is constructed to com pletion before all of the natural teeth have been extracted. The denture is in serted “immediately” after the la st extraction. Construction of an immediate denture can b e started with any num ber of teeth present in an arch. More comm only, construction is begun with only anteri or teeth remaining in the affected arch. The usual practice is to extract all of the posterior teeth first and wa it about 6 weeks for heal ing. Generally speaking, if there are fewer teeth removed at the time of insertion, there are greater chances for success. 7.155.2. The principle behind imm ediate denture construction is that a cast of the patient’s m outh with its na tural teeth present is s culptured into a shape th at represents the dentist’s best guess of what the residual ridge will look lik e after the teeth are extracted. The im mediate denture is made on this modified, sculptured cast. 7.156. Advantages of Immediate Dentures: 7.156.1. When making conventional complete dentures, it is best to wait at least 2 months after all the teeth have been rem oved before starting cons truction procedures. H owever, most patients are not willing to tolerate such an extended period of personal em barrassment. In the imm ediate denture treatm ent plan, the patient  walks into a dental office with  natural teeth that cannot be rehabilitated and walks out with a complete denture. 7.156.2. It is possible for the true occlusal vertical  dimension to be reproduced exactly. However, when opposing natural teeth are no t present at the start of a com plete dent ure procedure, the occlusal vertical dimension has to be estimated. 338  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 7.156.3. From the standpoint of im proved denture esthetics, a technician can re fer to a cast of the patient’s natural tooth arrangement for guidance. 7.156.4. When a denture base covers fresh extractipostoperative pain and healing progresses at a faster rate. on sites, patients seem  to experience less 7.157. Disadvantages of Immediate Dentures: 7.157.1. The cast on which an immediate denture is made is a sculptured estimate of how the ridge is supposed to look after the extractions. The denture fits as well as the dentist’s guess. 7.157.2. The bone surrounding extraction sites can be e xpected to decrease in height and width (resorb). Resorption is usually the greatest in the first 2 months after the extractions have been performed. It slows dow n to a gradual rate of ch ange after a year’s tim e. An imm ediate denture will become unstable and require relining within 3 to 10 months. 7.158. Impressions and Casts: e teeth. It is often advisable to pour the in delivery of the tient’s condition, fabricate a custom  t ray, and serve as a very 7.158.1. To fabricate the prelim inary impression and diagnostic cast, most dentists use alginate in a stock tray to make these impressions. The diagnostic cast is poured in the usual manner. The cast may be used to evaluate the pavaluable guide for selecting and arranging denturimpression that will serve as the opposing cast during later fabrication steps in an improved dental stone. (The use of a commercially available stone hardener is also advisable.) 7.158.2. If the dentist is not com fortable with the  first opposing cast m ade during the diagnostic impression appointment, then the opportunity to retake the impression will be available during the final im pression appo intment. This saves  the  pa tient unavoidable delays immediate denture. 7.158.3. For a final im pression, som e dentists use a  stock tray in combination with an elastic impression material; others use a custom tray. The tooth and tissue undercuts must be blocked out on the diagnostic cast and the custom tray adapted over them. As a rough guide, it takes at least 6 mm of relief for a tray to  satisfactorily accommodate an elastic impression material. In any event, the impressions described so far are made by the dentist in one step. 7.158.4. There is a very popular method of m aking immediate denture im pressions that requires two steps. F irst, a specialized cu stom tray is co nstructed to m atch outlines on the diagnostic cas t drawn by the dentis t. A tray of  this type usually takes in a ll of  the ed entulous areas. Af ter the dentist m akes the im pression of  th e poster ior edentulou s areas, he o r she tr ims the excess a nd returns the impression to the pati ent’s mouth. Using a stock tray, the dentist makes an alginate impression over the entire custom  tray. The anterior teeth and soft tissue areas are recorded in th e second im pression, and the custom  tray is rem oved from  the m outh e mbedded in the second impression. The result is a highly accurate combination impression of the dental arch. 7.158.5. To make a master cast, follow these guide lines: if the final impression can be boxed, box it; if the impression cannot be boxed, pour it in two stages. 7.159. Selecting Denture Teeth. The dentist will designate the shade and mold of the denture teeth. The mold can b e selected b y using  th e stone teeth on the cast  as a guide. Often, m ore than one mold is required. For example, a central incisor might be taken from one mold and a lateral incisor from another. Within the m echanical requirem ents of the prosth esis, every effort should be made to copy the arrangement of the patient’s own te eth. The dentist and the patient can  decide on slight modifications to improve the appearance of the den ture. Posterior te eth will be selected, usi ng the considerations for conventional complete dentures (paragraph 7.60). AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  7.160. Record Bases, Occlusion Rims, and Articulator Mounting. The steps associated with making record bases and occlusion rim s fo r imm ediate dentu res are essen tially the sam e as those used for making conventional dentures (Secti ons 7G and 7H). The only differen ce is that the portions of the record base occupied by the na tural teeth are excluded (Figure 7.134- A). The upper cast is mounted according to anatomical averages or with a facebow transfer supplied by the dentist. The dentist will use record bases and occlusion rims to make a jaw relationship record, and the technician will use the record to mount the lower cast (Figures 7.134-B through -D). 7.161. Arranging Denture Teeth: 339 7.161.1. Posterior Teeth. Posterior teeth are s et up on the reco rd base, but anterior teeth are not (Figure 7.134-E).

If the patient’s natural anterior to oth arrangement is acceptable, try t o copy it as closely as possible. The following steps provide guidance (Figure 7.134-F): 7.161.2.1. Mark the faciogingival a nd linguogingival junction betw een the tooth and the gum  tissue with a pencil. 7.161.2.2. Draw a long axis line on each stone tooth.  Extend this line onto the facial surface of the cast as far as the labial sulcus. 7.161.2.3. Consequentively num ber alternate teeth on  the cast. For example, num ber the left central incisor “1,” the right lateral incisor “2,” the left canine “3,” the right central incisor “4,” the left lateral incisor “5,” and the right canine “6.” 7.161.2.4. With the incisal guide pin touching the table, draw a line on the labial surfaces of the mandibular anterior teeth that indicates the am ount of m axillary inciso r and canine vertical overlap. 7.161.2.5. Measure the distance between the labial  surfaces of both canine with a Boley gauge. Record the measurement on the base of the cast. 7.161.2.6. Following the alternating tooth sequence as follows:  7.161.2.6.1. Use a saw or bur to cut down the m iddle of the tooth to the gingival pencil lines (Figure 7.134-G). 7.161.2.6.2.

Performing a Final Wax-Up. The final waxing and contouring of  an immediate d enture differs from a conventional denture in the following respects (Figure 7.136-C): 7.162.1. The palatal portion of  the record base is not sawed out  in a m axillary immediate denture final waxing procedure. Ensure the baseplate used for the posterior teeth try-in is no thicker than 2 to 3 mm. 7.162.2. The labial flange areas of an imm ediate denture require special  attention. If thick, bulky flanges are made to cover bony areas where virtua lly no resorption has occurred, the patient’s lips will appear ballooned and distorted.  If the resin is  too thin, the flanges will fractu re. Follow these suggestions for the labial flange areas of an immediate denture: 7.162.2.1. Fill the sulcu s rolls with  wax and co ntour the wax at the necks  of the teeth in the usual manner. 7.162.2.2. Make the depth of wax between the sulcus  rolls and the gingival contouring equal to one thickness of 28-gauge wax plus one thickness of baseplate wax.  7.162.2.3. Do not try to produce deep festooning . Instead, be content with surface irregularities resulting from the sheet wax following natural curvatures. 7.162.2.4. Stippling of the denture base for imm ediate dentures is not recommended. However, if stippling is used, be sure it is the positive, blow-on variety. 342  7.162.3. Be certain the teeth are in g ood centric occlusion and the incisal guide pin is touching the incisal guide table.  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 7.163. Flasking, Wax Elimination, Packing, Processing, and Finishing. Follow ordinary flasking and boilout practices. After the wax is eliminated, perform all of the following procedures that apply: 7.163.1. If the posterior palatal seal has not been cut into the cast, do it now (paragraph 7.101.1.2). 7.163.2. Imagine how the residual ridge  will look after the natural teeth are extracted. After the  wax is eliminated, wait until the flask is cool enough to handle (Figure 7.136-D). At this time, the dentist will trim off the faciogingival stone ledges and otherwise  modify the cast according to an estimate of alveolar bon e contours after the remaining natural teeth are rem oved. To do this, the dentist will usually draw a line on the cast, attempting to represent where the depth of the gingival sulcus can be found around each natural tooth. After cutting off the stone ledges, the dentist blends the contours of the cast into the pencil line (Figures 7.136-E and 7.137).  Figure  7.136.  Immediate  Denture  Fabrication  (Denture  Tooth  Setup  and  Preprocessing  Cast Corrections).  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 7.137. Trimming the Cast After Boilout. 343  7.163.3. After the dentist finishes trimming the case, he  or she may ord er a transparent surgical template. This template may be accomplished by two methods: 7.163.3.1. Vacuum Formed (Omnivac®) Method. Take a sheet of clear  plastic tray m aterial and suck it down over the cast and the half flask. Cut away the excess plastic tray material. 7.163.3.2. Compression-Molded Method: 7.163.3.2.1. After the dentist trim s the cast, m ake an alginate impression of the cast using a rim-lock tray. Pour a stone cast from this impression. Adapt two layers of pink baseplate wax to the duplicate cast for constructing a clear, surgical template. 7.163.3.2.2. Flask this cast in the us ual manner. Eliminate the wax. Appl y tinfoil substitute to the mold surfaces and to the surface of the cast. Pack and process using clear acrylic resin.  7.163.3.2.3. Finish and  polish the template. The tissu e surface of the templa te is used as a guide for surgically shaping the  ridge to conform  to the tissue  surface of the den ture. The principle behind the template is that skin  over bony areas is com pressed between the bone and the transparent plastic. L ooking through the plastic, th ese com pression areas appear white in contrast to the reddish coloration of the surrounding tissue. 7.163.4. Pack, cure, and deflask the im mediate denture. Restore the  denture’s occlusal vertical dimension. Finish and polish the denture (Figure 7.136-F).  Section 7AE—Cast Metal Denture Bases 7.164. Overview. The cast metal base denture is usually made of either chrome or an aluminum alloy. It is adaptable to either an upper or a lower denture. 7.165.  Advantages  of  Cast  Metal  Denture  Bases.  There are advan tages to us ing cast m etal bases.  Metal bases  are prim arily used in patien ts who c ontinually fracture their dentures during a norm al function. The strength factor allows  the denture to be m ade much thinner across the palate. As a result, the quality of the pa tient’s speech improves. Mouth tissu e tolerates chrome and alum inum alloy well.  Metal bases generally f it tissue con tours more accurately than processed resin. Metal is a m uch better conductor of temperature than acrylic resin, and many patients claim better taste sensations as a result. If a metal base is intentionally made to be heavy, the sheer weight helps keep the lower denture in place. 7.166. Disadvantages of Cast Metal Denture Bases. There are also disadvantag es to using ca st metal bases. Cast metal denture bases are more time-consuming to make and difficult to reline. All borders of AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 344  the denture that are made of metal must be accurately placed relative to limiting structures in the mouth because metal borders are difficult to adjust. 7.167. Metal Denture Base Designs. There are two basic designs for m etal denture bases. In the first design, all denture bearing  areas as well as all denture borders  are covered in m etal (Figure 7.138-A). (Note the retention beads and finish lines.) The second design is a combination of m etal and resin coverage. Metal reinforces only thos e critical areas of the denture ba se subject to fracture; processed resin accounts for the rest (Figure 7.138-B). The dentist chooses the design. 7.168. Combination Resin and Metal Maxillary Denture Base. Metal forms the palatal and posterior palatal seal portions of the denture and the rest is  resin (Figure 7.138-B). To construct this denture base, perform the following: 7.168.1. Read the instructions for relief, duplicframeworks described in Chapter 8.

If   the poster ior palata l sea l is to be in  m etal, it is  the respon sibility of  the dentis t to establish the boundaries of this area on the cast. Make  sure the posterior palatal seal has been cut into the cast. Following the dentis t’s design on the diagnostic cast,  block out the labial and buccal  undercuts, and seal the relief wax to the master cast in the appropriate areas. Make sure the palatal border of the relief wax is strai ght and well defined because it for ms the finish line for the acry lic resin on the tissue side of the denture. 7.168.3. Duplicate the master cast in investment. 7.168.4. Adapt a 26-gauge stipple sheet  to the palate. Add a retention  grid over the relief areas of the investment cast (Figure 7.139). Seal them together and to the cast.   AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 7.139. Cast Metal Denture Base (Wax Pattern). 345   7.168.5. Make the external finish line with 14-gauge half-round wax and sprue the pattern. 7.168.6. Coat the pattern with a w etting agent. Appl y the “paint-on” layer of investm ent in a  uniform 3 mm thickness. 7.168.7. After the paint-on layer of investment hardens, mix the outer investment and fill the flask. Submerge the pattern and cast in th e flask. W hen the investment hardens, elim inate the wax a nd make the casting. 7.168.8. Finish and polish the casting. 7.168.9. The finished metal base must be accurately  seated on the m aster cast. Continue with the denture tooth setup in the conventional m anner.  NOTE: The details of waxing a pattern and casting a metal palate are in Chapter 8 of this volume.  Section 7AF—Tooth-Supported Dentures (or Overdentures) 7.169. Overview. Occasionally, teeth purposely  cut down close to the level of  the g um line are left in  the alveolar bone to reduce the rate of ridge resorption. When a denture is m ade to fit “over” these  remaining teeth, the denture assumes the nam e overdenture (or  tooth-supported denture). The dentis t may choose to retain from  one to five teeth as ove rdenture abutments. Most commonly two abutm ents are chosen. The decision to save decay, potential for endodontic treatment, and their position in the dental arch. From a technical point of view, there is very little that is unusual about  these d entures. Th e difficulties associated  with overdentures arise due to the space limitations caused by the presence of abutment teeth. 7.170.  Increasing  Denture  Base  Strength. Tooth-supported dentures strengthening to prevent fracturing th e denture base, specifically in the area of the abutm ent teeth. This can be done by selecting a high impact resin using alternative packing techniques or by m aking a cast metal base. teeth as overdenture a butments is based on their periodontal health, (overdentures) often need 7.170.1.

NOTE: Even though the m anufacturer states th at Lucitone 199 acrylic does not need to be trial packed, standardized trial packing procedures generally yield more consistent results (paragraph 7.117). 346  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 7.170.2. Alternative Packing Techniques. Alternative packing techniques may also be utilized.  Improving the bonding between the denture base acrylic resin and the te eth can strengthen the denture base. The bonding surface area and chemical attachment are improved when the ridge laps of the teeth are prepared prior to packing. Prepare the posterior teeth by cutting dovetailed grooves approximately 2 mm wide and 2 mm d eep. Do not cut groo ves into the anterior teeth because th is may affect the shade of these teeth. Instead, drill  shallow holes with a round or inverted cone bur on the ridge laps of the anterior  teeth. Also, lightly roughen the pol ished ridge lap surface of the anterior teeth to remove the “glaze” layer. After completing the tooth preparations, carefully clean all deb ris f rom the m old, apply a tin f oil substitute to th e mold, rem ove any tin f oil subs titute applied to the teeth, and continue packing procedures. 7.170.3. Cast Metal Bases. Cast metal b ases can also be u sed to increase denture base strength. Strength is the basic purpose for making cast metal bases for a tooth-supported denture. Cast metal base designs are quite  different from  the one depicted in  Figure 7.138 for com plete dentures. Coverage is usually restricted to  the cres t of the alveo lar rid ge. Also, th ese bases are norm ally made to be com pletely covered with acryli c, showing no exposed m etal surfaces (paragraph 7.171). Cast m etal bases can be grouped into two categories; full arch bases and m inibases, as follows: 7.170.3.1.  Full  Arch  Bases. This design consists of a cross arch  cas ting using th e anterio r abutments bilaterally and including distal extensions to posterior  abutments or residual ridges  or both. In the m axillary arch, f ull pala tal cov erage o r a palatal s trap is added  to incre ase rigidity. 7.170.3.2. Minibases. These small unit castings may be individual covers for abutment teeth or they m ay be united  to  incre ase c ross arch str ength. Min ibases a re a lways lim ited to th e immediate areas of the abutment teeth. 7.171.  Fabricating  Cast  Metal  Bases. Cast metal bases for tooth-supported dentures are m ade of  chrome alloys. Full arch castings can be made by  using the partial denture fram ework fabrication sequence in Chapter 8. On the other hand, some m inibases may be s mall enough to be constructed by using the procedures for m aking base m etal fixed fr amework castings. This fabr ication sequence is as follows: 7.171.1. Survey the case and mark undesirable undercuts. vidual abutm ent teeth and tissue undercuts. 7.171.2.

Prepare the master cast for spruing and duplicate it in investment. 7.171.4. Transfer the design from the master cast to the refractory cast. 7.171.5. Adapt a layer o f 24-gauge sheet-casting wax to the refractory cast and trim to the outline scribed earlier. Seal the casting wax to the cast and lightly flame the pattern. Apply tacky liquid to the wax and  sprinkle tiny retention beads on th e surface. Two small 18-gauge wax wire hand les can also be added in the posterior area for the dentist’s use during jaw relation procedures.

Grind on any ar eas that prevent sea ting and then repolish them. 7.171.10. Note that the cast m etal base  may  need to be opaqued and will  probably need to be cemented to the cas t prior to pack ing. Opaquing the  retention side of the  metal base with a pink opaque (for example, Synfony®) is not usually a consideration unless there is a possibility of metal showing through a thin denture base. The dentist may ask that the casting be opaqued if conditions warrant it. 7.171.11. Lastly, the cast m etal base must be cemented to the cast to prev ent dislodgment during packing. This is especially im portant with m inibases because  they may not have any bracing qualities at all. A thin  mix of zinc phosphate cem ent is used  to hold the m etal base in place. Cyanoacrylate cement or Zap-It® may also be used. 7.171.12. After the cem ent has set, rem ove any excess. The denture can now be packed and completed in a normal manner. 7.172. Tooth-Supported Dentures With Retentive Attachments. This entirely special area of denture technology will not be discussed h ere. However, for an  authoritative reference, s ee Brewer, A.A. and Morrow, R.M., Overdentures, St. Louis, L.V., Mosby Co.  Section 7AG—Acrylic Denture Tooth Repairs 7.173. Tooth Repair Possibilities. There are at least two categories of denture tooth repair as follows: 7.173.1. The first category of denture  tooth repair is when the colla r area of the denture base (to include the facial and proxim al pl astic su rrounding the af fected too th) is still in tact. It is not necessary to alter the collar area of the denture base to perform the repair. 7.173.1.1. Reattach the original tooth  if it is still salvageab le. Sometimes a porcelain or plastic tooth may pop out of its seat in a denture base without damaging the base. 7.173.1.2. Replace a lost or broken tooth with a duplicate that has the exact collar and proximal shape. This is only possible if the collar and pr oximal contours of the or iginal tooth were not modified in any way and there is a duplicate handy. 7.173.2. The second category of denture tooth repair is when the collar area of the denture base (to include the facial and proxim al  plastic surrounding the tooth) m ust be altered to perform  the  repair.  7.173.2.1. The following possibilities m ay exist: the f acial plastic of the de nture base is still intact, the original denture tooth is lost o r broken, or the shape of th e available replacem ent tooth does not conform to the shape of the original “seat.” 7.173.2.2. In alm ost all repairs involving a plastic tooth, the original “seat” for the tooth is destroyed. A broken acrylic tooth  must be completely drilled out bef ore performing a repair.  Plastic teeth that are accidentally knocked out us ually carry some of the attached denture base with them. 7.174. Repair Procedures. Repair procedures are shown in Figure 7.140 and as follows: 7.174.1. Removing the Broken or Loose Tooth From the Denture Base. If a porcelain tooth is loose or broken, but it is still em bedded in the de nture base, free any mechan ical retention (pins, 348  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 diatoric) by cutting away the denture base material from the lingual surface. Do not cut through to h should easily and accura tely go back to its  the facial. P op the denture tooth loose. The tootoriginal position. In the case of an  acrylic tooth, the only choice is  to cut or grind the tooth out down to the denture base material. 7.174.2. Selecting a Replacement Tooth. If a new tooth is used, obtain the m old number of the  original tooth, indicating size and sh ape, from the  imprint of the ridgelap in the denture base. If this information is not available, select a replacement based on the apparent mold of the rest of the setup. Determine the shade from the adjacent teeth with the aid of a shade guide. 7.174.3. Preparing the Repair Site. Differences in preparation depend on whether the facial resin of the denture base is affected or not, as follows: 7.174.3.1. If the facial denture base resin is not affected: 7.174.3.1.1. Roughen the ridgelap of  acrylic teeth to guarantee good chemical bonding with the repair material. Cut a small diatoric into a plastic tooth as additional retention. 7.174.3.1.2. Make a “box” preparation in the denture  base lingual to the tooth to be repaired (Figure 7.140-A). 7.174.3.1.3. Position the tooth in its seat and stick y-wax it in place from  the lingual (Figure 7.140-B). 7.174.3.1.4. Construct a labial m atrix to hold the 7.140-C). 7.174.3.1.5. Remove the sticky wax after the stone is set (Figure 7.140-D). 7.174.3.1.6. Paint the matrix with a tinfoil substitute. 7.174.3.1.7. Reassemble the denture, tooth, and m atrix in correct alignm ent (Figure 7.140 -E). 7.174.3.1.8.

Position the tooth  by grinding eith er the de nture base or th e tooth, as required. Since denture base references for position ing a replacem ent tooth are un reliable, use a cast of the opposing natural teeth or opposing dent ure for positional reference. Sticky wax the replacement tooth in place from the lingual. 7.174.3.2.2. Reconstruct the missing facial denture base plastic in white (Ivory) wax. 7.174.3.2.3. Make a facial m atrix. During the progre ss of the repair, it holds the tooth in position and shapes the facial surface of the denture base. 7.174.3.2.4. Paint the matrix with a tinfoil substitute. 7.174.3.2.5. Remove all the wax from the teeth a nd denture base. Roughen the ridgelap area of resin rep lacement teeth. Cut a s mall diatoric  into a p lastic tooth as  additional retention insurance. 7.174.3.2.6. Lingual to the tooth to be repaired, m ake a box preparation in the denture base. Create butt joints between the denture base and the repair material where possible. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 7.140. Denture Tooth Repair. 349   7.174.3.2.7. Reassemble the denture, the tooth, and the matrix in proper alignment. 7.174.3.2.8. Sticky wax the tooth to the m atrix. Attach the matrix to the denture with sticky wax in two or three widely separated places. 7.174.4. Adding the Autopolymerizing Repair Resin: 7.174.4.1. Moisten the repair area with m onomer (Figure 7.140-F) and sprinkle with a layer of  polymer (Figure 7.140-G). Alternate the polymer and monomer until the repair resin is built up slightly higher than the susmall brush m oistened with monomer, remove any excess acrylic from  the li ngual and facial of the denture tooth (Figure 7.140-H and -I). rrounding denture base.

Let th e resin  cure in a pressure pot (Figure 7.140-J) Imm ersion of the repair in wa ter retards m onomer evaporation; while warm  water speeds up res in polymerization. In th e absence of directions, hold  water temperature to about 110 oF in the pot at a depth deep enough to cover  the repair. Secure the lid to the pot and apply a minimum 15lb/in2 of air pressure for 10 m inutes. Air pressure reduces bubble size and makes the resin denser. 7.174.5.  Finishing  and  Polishing  the  Repair. Use conventional finishing and polishing procedures to blend the repaired area to the existing denture base (Figure 7.140-K).  Section 7AH—Acrylic Denture Base Repair 7.175. Causes of Denture Breakage. Very often an already  existing weakness or fault in the prosthesis causes the breakage of the denture itse lf; and, unless this fault is rem edied at the tim e of the repair, it may soon break again from the same cause. 7.175.1. The dentist m ust make every effort to see  that causes such as faulty occlusion, poor fit due to mouth changes, or careless handling by the patient are corrected before proceeding with the repair. 7.175.2. Before the introduction of th e self-curing resins, m ost acrylic resin repairs were done by flasking. This frequently resulted in warpage of the  denture base caused by a release of strains in the original resin at curing temperature. The self-curing acrylic resins eliminate this hazard and are recommended for virtually all repair procedures. 7.176. Conditions for Success in any Repair Procedure. For a denture base repair to have a chance to be successful, the parts  m ust be perfectly clean, a ssembled with to tal accuracy, and kept ab solutely immobile while the repair resin cures. 7.177. Types of Denture Base Fractures: 7.177.1. Simple. In this type of fracture, the denture has usually been broken into pieces, and there is absolutely no doubt about how the pieces fit togeth er. The patient’s pres ence and clinical cooperation are not necessary. (See paragraph 7.178 for repair procedures.) 7.177.2. Complex. In this type of fracture, the p ieces cannot be made to fit against one another in precise relationships, and sometimes one or more fragments have been lost (for example, loss of a flange). The pieces can be realigt assis ts in the reconstruction and the patient is present. (See paragraph 7.179 for repair procedures.) ned or new resin added only if the dentis7.178. Repair Procedures for Simple Denture Base Fractures: 7.178.1. Assemble the parts of the denture. Apply s ticky wax to the fracture line to m aintain the pieces in correct apposition. It is a definite advantage to have a helper when joining the pieces. 7.178.2. Attach two or more old burs or pieces of co at hangar wire acro ss the fracture line of the denture to reinforce th e denture until the m atrix is m ade (Figure 7.141-A). Do not use wooden sticks, as wood tends to warp. 7.178.3. Block out all tissue su rface areas outside the  repair area with w et tissue or other suitable  material (Figure 7.141-B). Pour a cast of the denture to include generous areas on either side of the fracture line and on all denture bo rders (Figure 7.141-C). After the stone sets, rem ove the denture from the cast and trim the borders.  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 7.141. Denture Base Fracture Repair (Sprinkle-On Method). 351  7.178.4. Prepare the cast. Soak the cas t in SDS to rem ove the air. Blow  off the excess m oisture. Apply a tinfoil substitute to the cast at least 8 mm beyond the denture fracture line in all directions (Figure 7.141-D). Allow the tinfoil substitute to dry. 7.178.5. Rabbet and bevel the edges of the fracture line  on the pieces to be joined to increase the amount of bonding area between the old and new acrylic resin (Figure 7.141-E). 7.178.6. Rabbet along the edge of each fragm ent. Cu t a rabbet ch annel 3 to 4  mm  wide and  352  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 halfway through to the tissue surface of the denture. (The total width of the groove on the polished side of the denture should equal 6 to 8 mm.) 7.178.7. Bevel along the edge of each fragm ent. Straighten and smooth the edges of the fragments with an arbor band. Bevel the fractu re line so there is 2 mm of space on the tissu e side and 3 mm of space on the polished surface side. 7.178.8. Replace the denture fragments  on the cast in perfect alignment. Tack the fragments down with sticky wax (Figure 7.141-F). 7.178.9. Add the repair resin, using either autopolymerizing resin with both systems. the dough m ethod or the sprinkle m ethod. Use 7.178.9.1. Dough Method: 7.178.9.1.1. When using the dough m ethod, first soak ti ssue paper in warm  water to for m a soft pulp. Pack the pulp into the preparation and contour it to the desired shape. Prepare lingual and facial m atrices th at cover the tissue. (Before  making the m atrices, paint a separating medium onto the cast surfaces that come in contact with fluid plaster.) 7.178.9.1.2. Remove the hardened  matrices and we t tissue from  the cast.  Paint each m atrix with tinfoil substitute. Mix se lf-curing resin according to the m anufacturer’s directions and let it reach packing consistency. 7.178.9.1.3. Lightly m oisten the repair area w ith m onomer and press the doughy acrylic resin into th e repair area. Put the matrices  in place and ho ld with a rub ber band. Place th e assembly in a pressure pot and cure according to manufacturer’s directions. 7.178.9.2. Sprinkle Method. To use the sprinkle m ethod, start by m oistening the repair site with self-curing resin monomer (Figure 7.141-G). Sprinkle a layer of polym er over the desired area (Figure 7.141-H). Apply the monomer and polymer alternately until the material is built up to overfill the preparation slightly. (Overbuilding allows the finishing procedures after the resin cures.) Let the buildup stand for a few m inutes until the s heen disapp ears from the surface  (Figure 7.141-I). Place the assembly in a pressure pot. 7.178.10. Let the resin cure in a pressure pot accord ing to the m anufacturer’s directions (Figure 7.141-J). Immersion of the repair  in water retards m onomer evaporation; warm water speeds up resin polymerization. In the absence of  directions, hold water at about 110  oF in the pot at a depth deep enough to cover the repair. S ecure the lid to the pot and  apply a m inimum 15lb/in2 of air pressure for 10 minutes. Air pressure reduces bubble size and makes the resin denser. 7.178.11. Recover the repair and finishing. Release the pressure from  the pot. Carefully rem ove the repaired denture fro m the cast. Trim  the new m aterial so it is even w ith the o ld acrylic r esin (Figure 7.141-K). Assuming it already has the proper thickness, trim the old material no more than is necessary. Finish and polish the denture in the usual manner (Figure 7.141-L). 7.179. Repair Procedure for Complex Denture Base Fractures. In this type of repair, the most likely problem is that a piece of the denture is m issing  and m ust be replaced. Pa tients routinely fracture a denture flange and lose the fragm ent. The dentist will use a m aterial-like modeling plastic, add it to the denture’s fracture line, place the d enture in the patient’s mouth, and  shape a n ew section for the los t piece of the denture. The technician will receive a denture with a replacement area made from modeling plastic. The modeling plastic will be converted into resin, using the following sequence: 7.179.1. Use wet paper towels or wet tissue to pack undercut areas not involved in the repair. Pour a cast that includes all denture borders and the ti ssue surface of the m odeling plastic section, plus an additional 8 mm of denture tissue surface. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  353 from the cast. Cut the m odeling plastic away 7.179.2. After the stone is set, remove the denture from the denture and bevel the den ture’s broken margin. Paint tinf oil substitute onto the cast to take in all of the repair area and 8 mm beyond. 7.179.3. Replace the denture on the cast and tack it down with sticky wax. 7.179.4. Repair the denture by the dough or sprinkle method. 7.179.5. Finish and polish the denture.  Section 7AI—Relining a Complete Denture 7.180. Resurfacing the Tissue Side of a Denture: 7.180.1. A reline is the resurfacing of the tissue side of a denture, using new base material to make the denture fit more accurately. 7.180.2. The reline can represent a solution to two problems, and one or both problems can exist at the same time. The f irst problem is a den ture that is unstable on the re sidual ridge. The second problem is that a patient’s occlusal vertical dimension is showing progressive overclosure because of generalized denture tooth wear or ridge resorption. 7.180.3. There are a number of acceptable ways to perform a reline. Two methods are described in this chapter; the jig method (paragraph 7.182) and the flask method (paragraph 7.183). 7.181. Clinical Procedures. In the clinical part of the reline procedure, the dentist must first modify the denture by grinding out tissue surf ace undercuts and uniformly reducin g the flanges about 2 mm . Using the denture as a custom  tray, the dentist will make a new impression on the ar ch. The patient will hold the teeth  in  centric occlusion  and the m andible in   centric re lation w hile the  im pression m aterial is setting. This com bined denture im pression-jaw rela tionship record will be delivered to the dental laboratory (Figure 7.142-B). 7.182. Jig Method. The following procedures are included in the jig method: 7.182.1. Cast Fabrication. Box and pour the impression. Use e qual parts plaster and pum ice to box elastic im pression m aterials. Use conven tional wax beading and boxing for zinc oxide-eugenol impressions (Figure 7.142-C). After the cas t is poured, trim  it (Figure 7.142-D) and cut index notches in the base (Figure 7.142-E). Do not remove the denture from the cast at this time. 7.182.2. Mounting the Assembly in the Jig (Mandibular Denture): nture out of the tooth 7.182.2.1. Start by shaping a dental st one patty on the botto m half of the jig.  Gently press the  occlusal surfaces and incisal edges  into the m ix. Do not sink the denture past the greates t diameters of the teeth. Get a decen t imprint of occlusal surfaces and incisal edges . After the  stone sets, it should be possible to pull the deindentations without difficulty. 7.182.2.2. Assemble the jig. Tighten the locknuts a nd make certain the shoulders of the upper half fit flush on the  posts in m etal-to-metal contact. Make sure the denture teeth are perfectly  seated in the index and tack the teeth to the dental stone with sticky wax. 7.182.2.3. Remove the upper half of the  jig to attach the cast to th e jig. Apply dental stone to the base of the cast bein g sure to fill the i ndex notches. Replace th e upper half of the jig and tighten the locknuts. Make certain  the upper half  jig is m aking metal to metal contact with the posts and the undercut hole in the upper half is filled in completely. 354  Figure 7.142. Jig Relining of a Maxillary Complete Denture. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005   AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 7.142. Continued. 355   7.182.3. Mounting the Assembly in the Jig (Maxillary Denture): 7.182.3.1. A m axillary denture uses a slightly differe nt treatment. Make sure the vault of the denture is supported against forc es generated during the packing  phase of the reline procedure. Block out all undercuts on the linguogingival surfaces of the teeth and the palatal surface of the denture using a color of material that contrasts against white and pink (Figure 7.142-F). 7.182.3.2. Form a dental stone mound on the bottom half of the jig. Fill the palatal vault of the  denture with stone up to the leve l of the teeth (Figure 7.142-G). Ce nter the denture on the patty without burying the facial surfaces of the teeth (Figure7.142-H). off the index and rem ove every trace of 7.182.3.3. After the stone sets, take the denture blockout wax. Seat the denture b ack in the index and sticky-wax it down. Attach the cast to the upper half of the jig in the same manner described for the mandibular denture (Figure 7.142-I). 7.182.4. Preparing the Cast: 356  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 e denture or the cast. The 7.182.4.1. Remove the locknuts and lift the denture fr om the occlusal index. Carefully separate the denture from  the cast (F igure 7.142-J). Do not break thretromylohyoid area of a m andibular denture’s li ngual flange has the most potential for being severely undercut. If th e mandibular denture cannot  be removed from  its cast becau se of such an undercut, cut off the specific part of the li ngual flange. When removing an undercut flange, the cut extends through the plastic to the impression material. Be careful not to cut into the cast. 7.182.4.2. When dealing with a maxillary denture, as k the dentist to cut the posterior palatal seal (Figure 7.142-K). 7.182.4.3. Soak the cast in lukewarm SDS for 5 minutes. Flush the cast with hot water. 7.182.4.4. Paint the cast with a tinfoil substitute and let it cool (Figure 7.142-L). 7.182.5. Preparing the Denture: 7.182.5.1. Grind out the impression material from the denture (Figure 7.142-M). 7.182.5.2. If the dentist hasn’t already done it, relie ve all undercuts on the tissue su rface of the denture and create a butt joint at the flange borders (Figure 7.142-N). 7.182.5.3. Uniformly roughen the entire  tissue surface of the denture.  This helps improve the bond between the denture base and the new resin. 7.182.6. Mixing and Applying the Resin:  sin powder to one part liquid. The fluid 7.182.6.1. Use a ratio of two parts self-curing reconsistency this ratio produces is essential  for minimum entrapment of air and good bonding with the denture base material. 7.182.6.2. Put the liquid in a glass jar and slowly add the powder. Swirl the jar until the powder is saturated. Use a spatula to sp read the resin around th e buccal and labial su lci of the cast. Be sure to fill all undercuts with resin (Figure 7.142-O). Push the resin ahead of the spatula, being careful not to trap the air. 7.182.6.3. So far, the tissue surface of the denturbond between the new resin and the denture base. To enhance that bond even further, paint th e tissue surface of the den ture with monomer. Then spread the rem ainder of the fluid resin onto the tissue side of the denture (Figure 7.142-P). e base has been roughened to improve the 7.182.7. Packing the Denture: (NOTE: Always wear disposable gloves when handling acrylic resin.) 7.182.7.1. First, allow the remaining resin to gel until it no longer runs freely. Place the denture into the tooth index on the bottom  half of the jig (Figure 7.142-Q). Attach th e top plate of the jig with thumbnuts and close it ju st short (about 2 mm ) of the m etal-to-metal contact. Use a moistened-gloved finger or cotton tip applicator to push the resin back between the denture and the cast (Figure 7.142-R). 7.182.7.2. Wait until the resin is doughy porous reline. Tighten the thum bnuts, a lternating sides,  until there  is  m etal-to-metal conta ct between the top plate and the shoulders of the posts. Metal-to-metal contact must be achieved. and firm . Pre mature jig cl osure could result in a 7.182.8. Curing the Denture. Cure the denture in a pressure  pot with lukewarm  water (110  oF). Apply a minimum of 15 lb/in2 for at least 10 minutes (Figure 7.142-S). AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  7.182.9.  Finishing  and  Polishing  the  Denture. Finish and polish the procedures for complete dentures (Figure 7.142-T). 357 relined denture using 7.183. Flask Method: 7.183.1. Cast Fabrication. Box and pour the denture containing th e impression in  artificial stone in the same manner as the jig  method, except no index notches ar e required. Flask the denture the same way as in complete denture techniques (paragraph 7.104). 7.183.2.  Separating  the  Flask  Halves. To soften the impression m aterial, place the flask in boiling water for 4 minutes. Remove the flask from the water and open the flask. 7.183.3. Preparing the Cast. Flush the debris from  the cast a nd let the flask halves cool down. Give the ca st to the de ntist f or pla cement of  the poste rior palatal s eal. On return,  paint tinf oil substitute onto the cast surface and let it dry. 7.183.4.  Preparing  the  Denture. Grind out all rem aining im pression m aterial and uniform ly roughen the tissue surface of the denture with an acrylic bur. 7.183.5. Packing and Curing. Use self -curing resin as the reline material; with its use, ther e is less danger of warping the denture base.  Be sure the mold is cold before packing. Mix the acrylic resin according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Moisten the tissue side of the denture base with monomer and place th e new resin in  the mold. There is a relatively short working tim e with self-curing resins, so work efficiently to ensure at leas t one trial pack. Bench cure the resin in the flask press for 1 hour. 7.183.6.  Deflasking,  Finishing,  and  Polishing. Use the comm only accepted  pro cedures for complete dentures.  Section 7AJ—Rebasing (Duplicating) a Denture Base 7.184.  What  is  Rebasing?  Rebasing a denture involves refittiimpression (as in a reline) and replac ing all the denture base  material with new acrylic resin. It can be  done for those dentures whose base m aterial is discolored after being us ed for years or for dentures that have been repaired several times. ng the denture using a corrective 7.184.1. Rebasing is not done frequently because acrylic teeth in most old dentures show advanced wear and are not serv iceable. Ho wever, rebasing an old denture making a new one. Rebasing is the treatm ent of choice when the time factor is important or when the teeth are in good condition. A rebased denture serves as the perfect temporary prosthesis while a new denture is being made.  7.184.2. Because th e denture base material is com pletely removed in rebasing, th ere must be a means of maintaining the relationship of the teeth to each  other and to the ridge while the d enture teeth are without support. Articulators were exteoccasionally move or bend. The best option is to use a rigid relining jig. The procedures associated with using the reline jig are in paragraph 7.185. nsively used for this purpose, but their parts is a great deal quicker than 7.185. Procedures for Using a Reline Jig: 7.185.1.  Cast  Fabrication. Af ter the dentis t m akes the impression a s descr ibed f or a relin e (paragraph 7.181), box and pour the im pression. After the artificial stone has set, trim the cast and index the base. Replace the missing or broken teeth and wax them in position. 7.185.2.  Mounting  the  Assembly  in  the  Jig. Follow th e procedu res  outlined in paragraphs  7.182.2 and 7.182.3. 358  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 7.185.3. Recovering the Denture Teeth. Remove the denture from  the cast and then separate the  teeth from the denture base as follows: 7.185.3.1. Removing Porcelain Teeth. Heat the teeth and adjacent acrylic resin slowly with an alcohol torch. (Rapid heating will  cause the teeth to crack.) T o distribute the heat more evenly, apply a th in film of petroleum jelly on the tee th. When the acrylic resi n turns white, rem ove each dentu re tooth by prying it lo ose with an  in strument. Clean and place each tooth in its proper position in the stone index. Apply s mall amounts of baseplate wax to the lingual aspect of each denture tooth to join them together as a unit. 7.185.3.2. Removing Plastic Teeth. If the denture teeth are m ade of acrylic resin, do not use heat to remove the base. Separate acrylic resin  denture teeth from the old denture base in three sections; anterior, right posterior, and left poste rior. Use discs, burs, and abrasive wheels to perform the  separation. Re move all denture  base m aterial except a s mall am ount on the  ridgelaps of the denture teeth. Place the segments back in the index. teeth and up around the ridge of the cast. 7.185.4. Reconstructing the Denture Base in Wax. Place a softened roll of basep late wax on the teeth. Use enough wax so it presses down around the Make alternating turns on the thum bscrews and close the to p plate  of the jig down until it m akes contact with the shoulders  of the pos ts. Seal the baseplate wax to the teeth and the cast. W ax and contour a denture base in the  usual m anner.

Section 7AK—Duplicate Dentures (Dental Flask Method) 7.186. Overview. There may be occasions when  a duplicate of a complete denture must be m ade. This duplicate denture is a spare denture for the patient whose original dent ure is either lost or m ay need repair. Duplicate dentures m ade completely of self -curing acrylic resin can be constructed quickly and accurately. 7.187.  Equipment  and  Materials. The denture flask m ethod uses  the following equipm ent and materials, which are all readily availab le in the de ntal labo ratory: m andibular denture flask, alginate impression material, utility wax o r orthodontic tray  wax, to oth-colored acrylic poly mer, and reline o r repair self-curing acrylic (monomer and polymer). 7.188. Procedures: 7.188.1. Modifying the Denture Flask. Cut a large rec tangular opening in the rea r part of the  lower-half flask. In Figure 7.143-A,  notice that the flask is shown upside down and the knock out plate is removed. From this point on, the flasrelationship, not by their customary names. 7.188.2. Spruing the Denture. Sprue the denture by rolling strips  of utility wax toge ther to form sprues about 3 inches long and 1/2 inch in diam eter. Attach the sp rues to the lingual surface of k parts are referred to in this upside down AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  359 mandibular dentures and to the palatal surface of th e tuberosity area of maxillary dentures (Figure  7.143-B). Draw the ends of the sprues together so they meet in the center.  Figure 7.143. Duplicate Dentures (Denture Flask Method).  7.188.3. Preparing the Flask. Apply alginate adhesive to the in side of the flask. This adhesive  retains the alginate in  the flask during later pro cessing steps. Also, coat  the lip of the knockout plate so it can be firmly attached to the exterior of the flask. 7.188.4.  Lower-Half  Flasking  the  Denture. Mix the alginate for the lower h alf using a  mechanical spatulator. (Vacuum-mixing is preferred over hand-mixing). Coat the tissue surface of the denture with alginate, being careful to minimize voids (Figure 7.143-C). Fill the interior of the denture with alginate. Place the rem aining mix of alginate in the lower flask. Settle the denture in the alginate-filled flask and make sure the denture borders are covered (Figure 7.143-D). Let it set 15 minutes. 7.188.5.  Full  Flasking  the  Denture. Assem ble the upper half of the flask and make sure the sprues extend through the opening.  Mold the sprue wax extensions  over the opening to create a leak-proof seal (Figure 7.143-E). Make a larger m ix of alginate fo r the upper half. C oat the teeth with alginate and then pour al ginate through the knock out plate op ening. Let the alginate set for 15 minutes before removing the denture. 7.188.6. Preparing the Mold. Carefully separate the flask and rem ove the denture. Use a gentl e stream of air or absorbent tissue to remove moisture from the tooth imprints. 7.188.7. Processing the Resin:  7.188.7.1. Use the b rush techn ique described  in  paragraph 7.125.3.5 to place tooth-co lored resin into the tooth im prints (Figure 7.143-F). (U se an incisal shade and gingival tooth shade acrylic to make the dentures look more authen tic.) Fill the imprints to the cervical line, but do not overfill them. Allow the resin to set for a few minutes before reassembling the flask. 7.188.7.2. Carefully dry the alginate surface in  the lower flask. Place the flask halv es together and secu re them  with a heavy rub ber band.  Mi x the reline or repair acrylic using 2 parts AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 polymer to 1 part m onomer ratio. If  a pour-type resin (for exam ple, Pronto ® or Tru-Pour ®) is available, use it instead of the repair material. 7.188.7.3. Pour the resin mix into one sprue hole until it  fills the other sprue. Use a vibrator to  best accomplish this procedure. Attach two mounds of clay to the  front of the flask so it stands upright. Half-fill a press ure pot with  warm water (110  oF) and place th e flask in it. Cure the denture at a minimum of 15 lb/in2 for 10 minutes. 7.188.8.  Recovering,  Finishing,  and  Polishing  the  Denture. Recover the duplicate denture, desprue it, and finish and polish it in a norm al manner. Be more careful of these (d uplicate) teeth because they are softer than the standard denture teeth. 360   AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Chapter 8 361   CLASP-RETAINED REMOVABLE PARTIAL DENTURES (RPD) Section 8A—Classifications 8.1.  Definition  of  an  RPD. An   RPD  is a rem ovable replacem ent for m issing natural teeth, gingival tissue, and supporting bone when one or more natural teeth still remain (Figure 8.1).  Figure 8.1. Maxillary and Mandibular RPDs.  8.2. Purpose of an RPD. An RPD’s purpose is to restore a patient’s appearance and chewing ability without damaging the natural teeth and supporting tissues. 8.3. RPD Categories: 8.3.1.  Cast  Metal  Framework  RPD  to  Which  Denture  Plastic  and  Artificial  Teeth  are Attached. The m ilitary dental laboratories use a nickel chrom e-alloy, Ticonium® metal for RPD framework castings. Vitallium ®, a chrom e-cobalt alloy, is available for those with an allergy to nickel. Type IV gold might be used for a case that has special requirements. 8.3.2. All-Metal RPD. The entire RPD (frame, denture base, and teeth) is made from cast metal. 8.3.3. Interim or Transitional Acrylic RPD. Most or all of the RPD is m ade with acrylic and plastic denture teeth. This is called an “interim ” RPD and is intended to be tem porary in nature. Often, wrought wire clasps are added to the acrylic  body of an interim RPD to help retain it in the mouth. 8.4. Structural Requirements. If an RPD is to serve its stated purpose, it must be: 8.4.1. Retained. It must stay in place in the mouth. 8.4.2. Supported. The various RPD parts m ust not damage the tissues they m ight cover within a mouth. 8.4.3. Braced. Shifting movements of the RPD from  front to back or from  side to side should be restricted as m uch as possible. To a large  extent, RPDs are retained, supported, and braced by remaining natural teeth. (An abutment tooth is a natural tooth specifically used for RPD retention, bracing, or support.) 362  8.5. RPD Classifications Based on Patterns of Tooth Loss: AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 8.5.1. There are over 50,000 possible combinations of teeth and edentulous spaces in a single arch. Several m ethods of classifying partially edentu lous arches are in use today. Two m ethods are presented in this chapter—the W ord Pictur e classification (paragraph 8.6) and the Kennedy classification (paragraph 8.7). 8.5.2. All of the survey and design instruction in classification. The Kennedy system ,  with its m odifications, is the very elaborate classification taught in m ost dental schools. Although it has a high recognition factor am ong dentists, it is difficult to apply general survey and design rule s to all of the subgroups in the Kennedy system . Thus, using the Word Picture classification is the simpler option. this chapter is keyed to the W ord Picture 8.6. Word Picture Method. This classification is practical and si mple to remember. It recognizes eight basic patterns of tooth loss (Figure 8.2). An RPD is classified according to th e pattern of loss it m ost closely resembles. For example, an RPD made to restore a posterior unilateral toothborne pattern of loss becomes a posterior unilateral toothborne RPD. The basic classifications (pattern of loss) are as follows:  Figure 8.2. Word Picture and Kennedy RPD Classifications.  8.6.1. Toothborne RPDs. These RPDs are supported entirely by the remaining natural teeth. 8.6.1.1. Posterior Toothborne. No anterior teeth are m issing, and the defect is lim ited to the posterior area are as follows: 8.6.1.1.1.  Posterior  Unilateral  Toothborne. This is characterized by unilateral posterior edentulous space (or spaces) with both anterior and posterior natural teeth rem aining mesial and distal to the edentulous space (or spaces) (Figure 8.2-A). AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  363 8.6.1.1.2.  Posterior  Bilateral  Toothborne. This is characterized by bilateral posterior edentulous spaces with natural teeth both anterior (m esial) and posterior (distal) to the spaces (Figure 8.2-B). 8.6.1.2. Anterior Toothborne. Anterior defect is present,  and no posterior teeth are m issing (Figure 8.2-C). The residual ridge and the teeth ad jacent to it fall on a relatively straight line. More than one edentulous space m ight be pres ent, but the largest space does not span m ore than two adjacent missing teeth. 8.6.1.3.  Combination  Toothborne. This is a m ixture of anterior and posterior toothborne situations (Figure 8.2-D). 8.6.2. Extension RPDs. These RPDs are supported by the rem aining natural teeth and the tissues of the residual ridges. All extension RPDs have an  axis of rotation that runs through or near the rest nearest the extension base (Figure 8.3). Th e rotation occurs because the tissue beneath the extension base will com press m uch m ore than th e teeth when the partial denture is used fchewing. Classifications include: or 8.6.2.1.  Distal  Extension. This is the edentulous area is located posterior to the remnatural teeth. aining 8.6.2.1.1. Unilateral Distal Extension. The distal extension defect is present on one side of the arch (Figure 8.2-E). 8.6.2.1.2. Bilateral Distal Extension. The distal extension problem  is present on both sides of the arch (Figure 8.2-F).  Figure 8.3. Axis of Rotation for an Extension RPD.   8.6.2.2.  Anterior  Extension. This is a single edentulous area that crosses the m idline. It is located anterior to the rem aining natural teeth (Figure 8.2-G). The residual ridge and the teeth adjacent to it fall on a curved line.  To be placed in this category, m ost patients will have three or m ore adjacent anterior teeth m issing. The an terior extension defect can, and often does, include missing posterior teeth. 8.6.2.3. Combination Extension. This is a m ixture of anterior  and distal extension situations (Figure 8.2-H). NOTE: When a case shows a m ixture of extension and toothborne defects, the case is classified according to the kind of exte nsion situation it represents. (Extension defects are considered more serious than toothborne problems.) 364  8.7. Kennedy Classification: AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 8.7.1. In 1925, Kennedy devised a classification that c oncerned itself with the missing teeth rather than the type of RPD that woul d replace those teeth. Kennedy did research that showed the m ost frequently encountered RPD was the one replacing  the most posterior teeth bilaterally. He nam ed this bilateral distal extension situation ClKennedy was the unilateral distal extension basefrequently prescribed RPD today is not a Class excellent aid to remembering his classification system.  8.7.2. This classification system  (explained below)  will enable the laboratory technician to converse with the dentist, using the same terminology:  which he called Class II. Although the m ost I, the original rationale Kennedy used is an ass 1. The next m ost com mon situation found by 8.7.2.1. Class I—bilateral edentulous areas located posterior to the remaining natural teeth. 8.7.2.2. Class II—a unilateral edentulous area located posterior to the remaining natural teeth. 8.7.2.3. Class III—a unilateral edentulous area with  natural teeth rem aining both anterior and posterior to it. 8.7.2.4. Class IV—a single, but bilateral (crossianterior to the remaining natural teeth. There are no modifications to this situation. ng the m idline), edentulous area located 8.7.3. There are im portant points to rem ember wh en using the Kennedy classification. Do not include m issing teeth that are not to be replaced (for exam ple, third m olars). Choose the m ost posterior edentulous area (or areas) to determ ine the classification. Call any additional edentulous areas “modification spaces.”  Section 8B—RPD Components and Construction 8.8.  Overview.  An RPD consists of the following parts support elem ents (paragraph 8.10), retainers (par8.14), and artificial replacements for natural teeth and tissue (paragraph 8.15). 8.9. Connectors. A connector is a component that joins one part of the RPD to another, as follows: or com ponents: connectors (paragraph 8.9), agraphs 8.11 - 8.13), bracing elem ents (paragraph 8.9.1. Major Connectors. Almost all RPDs have a right side  and a left side. A m ajor connector joins the two sides of an RPD and distributes so me of the stress from  chewing on one side to structures on the opposite side. A rigid m ajor connector must unite retentive com ponents such as clasps; otherwise, the retentive com ponent doe s not perform  as intended. Major connectors are either maxillary or mandibular, as follows: 8.9.1.1. Maxillary Major Connectors (Figures 8.4 and 8.5): 8.9.1.1.1. Palatal Strap. The palatal strap major connector is a single wide strap that crosses the palate. It is m ost often used for sim ple bilateral posterior toothborne partial dentures. The strap m ust be 8 m m wide for adequate  strength. A palatal strap should not cross over maxillary tori. Therefore, when tori are present, a palatal strap may not be possible.  8.9.1.1.2.  Palatal  Bar. Sim ilar to a palatal strap, a palatal bar is narrower and thicker. Palatal bars are less comfortable for the patient and are rarely used. 8.9.1.1.3. Anterior-Posterior Palatal Strap. The anterior-posterior palatal strap is one of the most commonly used maxillary major connectors. The strap must be 6 to 8 m m wide. It is very rigid and well accepted by most patients.  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 8.4. Maxillary Major Connectors. 365  8.9.1.1.4.  Lingual  Plate  Design  Variations. The m ost im portant distinction between bar and strap m ajor connectors and plate-type m ajor connectors is the border of bar and strap major connectors is located at least 6 m m away from gingival margins, while the border of the plate m ajor connectors ends on the lingual surface of teeth. Plating m ay be used to stabilize periodontally weakened teeth, reciprocate retentive clasps, and provide easy addition of replacem ent teeth if additional natu ral teeth are lost in the future. W hen the connector must cross the gingival m argin, it must cross at a 90-degree angle. These designs are exemplified in the following connectors: 8.9.1.1.4.1. Horseshoe. This design is shaped like a hor seshoe placed around the vault of the palate. It is less desirable than the anterior-posterior palatal strap because it is less rigid. It is norm ally used when the dentist is  trying to avoid m axillary tori or when the palatal vault is very deep. 8.9.1.1.4.2. Closed Horseshoe. This connector is like a horseshoe with an added palatal strap connecting the two posterior sides. Anothe r way to visualize this connector is as an anterior-posterior strap with lingual plating. horseshoe or an anterior-posterior strap. This design is m ore rigid than either a 366  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 8.9.1.1.4.3. Full Palatal Plate. This design is som etimes used to gain m ore support for the removable partial denture. The full palatal plate m ay be used when m any teeth are missing or in com bination anterior or posterior extension cases. However, m any patients find the full coverage of the palate objectionable. 8.9.1.2. Mandibular Major Connectors (Figure 8.5):  Figure 8.5. Maxillary and Mandibular Major Connectors.  8.9.1.2.1.  Lingual  Bar. The lingual bar is the m ost com monly used m andibular m ajor connector. When there is no requirem ent for additional indirect retention or stabilization of  weakened teeth, it is the connector of choice.  A lingual bar must be located a minimum of 4 mm distant from the gingival m argin, must be 5 mm in width, and m ust not impinge on the floor of the mouth. Therefore, if 9 mm of space is not available from  the gingival margin to the floor of the mouth, lingual plating must be used. 8.9.1.2.2.  Sublingual  Bar. This is a variation of a lingual lingual bar turned 90 degrees to fit under the insufficient room  for a lingual bar and plating accommodate distal end extension cases. bar. It is best thought of as a tongue. It m ay be indicated if there is (or other alternatives) cannot be used to AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  367  Figure 8.6.

This variation of  the sim ple lingual bar design provides indirect retention if cingulae of the m andibular incisors, and it cprosthesis. It m ay be used if plating is the best choice for a m ajor connector. However, because of recession of the gingival, m any spaces exist in the lingual em brasures, making the metal of a lingual plating design visible from the front of the mouth.

A labial bar is used as a last resort when severe, bilateral, posterior lingual, or anterior oriented major connector. lingual undercuts prevent placem ent of a lingually ay create an unpleasant food trap that patients find  8.9.1.2.5. Cingulum Bar. This major connector runs across the cingulae of the teeth with its inferior border at least 3 m m away f rom the ti ssue. It m ay be used if  there is little or no lingual vestibule present. All of the bars except the lingual bar are rarely used. 8.9.1.2.6. Lingual Plate. When it is not possible to place the superior border of the lingual bar 4 m m away from  the gingival m argin, a li ngual plate is an excellent alternative. A lingual plate provides im proved horizontal stab ility of the RPD, stabilizes periodontally weakened teeth, and facilitates the future replacement of natural teeth. As is any plate design, metal covers the gingival tissues and m ay be less com fortable than a bar to som e patients. The plate can com promise esthetics if there are spaces between the teeth, allowing the metal to show. If  the incisors are rotate d or overlapped, it m ay not be possible to seal plating against the teeth unless the dentist reshapes the lingual surfaces of the teeth. 8.9.2. Minor Connectors. Minor connectors join a m ajor connector to other com ponents of the RPD. Minor connectors fall into two categories; (1 ) metal struts that join clasp assem blies and auxiliary rests to a m ajor connector, and (2) m etal grids that join resin denture base areas to the major connector. 8.10. Support Elements. Support elements prevent the RPD from  pushing gingivally into the tissue of the mouth. Support elem ents consist of rests  in contact with properly contoured rest seats and broad-based coverage of edentulous ridges. 368  8.10.1. Rests: AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 8.10.1.1. Rest Seats. Abutments are teeth used for support and retention. Before making a final impression for an RPD, the dentist cuts special depressions (rest seats) into abutm ent teeth (Figure 8.7). On a cast of the patient’s  mouth, partial denture units called rests  are constructed to fit into the rest seats. Types of rest seats are as follows:  Figure 8.7. Rest Seats.  8.10.1.1.1. Incisal rest seat--a preparation located on the incisal edge of an anterior tooth. 8.10.1.1.2. Lingual rest seat--a preparation located on the lingual surface of an anterior tooth. 8.10.1.1.3. Occlusal rest seat--a preparation located on the occlusal surface of a posterior tooth. 8.10.1.2. Types of Rests. Rests can be named or identified in either of the following two ways, clasp assembly or auxiliary, as follows: 8.10.1.2.1. Clasp Assembly Rest (Figures 8.8. and 8.9-A). A clasp assembly rest is part of an RPD component complex called a  clasp assembly. A clasp assem bly consists of a clasp, rest, and minor connector. (Some assemblies consist of more than one clasp.) According to the seats that clasp assem bly rests occupy, th ere are incisal clasp assem bly rests, lingual clasp assembly rests, and occlusal clasp assembly rests.  8.10.1.2.2. Auxiliary Rest (Figure 8.9-B). By exclusion, auxiliary rests are all rests that are not part of clasp assem blies. According to th e seats auxiliary rests occupy, there are incisal auxiliary rests, lingual auxiliary rests, and occlusal auxiliary rests. 8.10.1.3.  Rest  Requirements. All rests m ust be thick enough chewing forces without breaking. It is the denpatient’s teeth to ensure the interior of  the rest  is slightly deeper than the exterior and to m ake the seats deep enough (1 to 1.5 mresponsibility for fabricating the rests of adequate thickness shifts to the technician. m).

Tuberosities must be covered in m axillary distal extension cases. It is just as critical f or at least half of the retromolar pad area to be covered in  mandibular distal extension cases. Failure to properly extend the tissue replacement portion in extension cases can cause irreversible damage to gingiva and underlying bone.  Figure 8.8. Clasp Assembly.  Figure 8.9. Rests—Clasp Assembly (A) and Auxiliary (B).  8.11. Retainers. There are two broad categories of retainers, direct and indirect. Both varieties hinder movement of an RPD occlusally; the difference is in  how they do it. Direct retainers either grasp or are grasped by an abutment tooth to resist the removal of the RPD in an occlusal  direction. On an extension base RPD, it is best to place direct retainers only on abutmparagraphs 8.12 for the characteristics of direct retainers.) Indirect retainers are rests placed opposite the axis of rotation from the denture base on an extension base RPD to change the fulcrum when the denture base is moved occlusally, such as when eating s ticky foods. (See paragraphs 8.13 for the characteristics of indirect retainers.) 8.12. Direct Retainers: ent teeth on the axis of rotation. (See 8.12.1. Precision Attachments. Most precision attachment devices are retentive system s. A large 370  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 variety of precision attachm ents are available.  These vary from  ball and socket com ponents to miniature metal tracks, where a track (m ale), which is attached to the fram ework, slides into a keyway (fem ale) housed within  a m etal crown on an abutm ent tooth. Retention (resistance to occlusal movement) may be obtained by frictional  resistance, springs, O-rings, m agnets or other devices.  8.12.2. Clasps:  8.12.2.1.  Overview.  A clasp is the part of an RPD that acts as a direct retainer by partially encircling and contacting an abutm ent tooth. Th e clasp is the m ost commonly used m eans of direct retention. It is im portant to define so me term s before exam ining clasps in detail. A tooth’s greatest circum ference is called its  height  of  contour. The height of contour, when identified and m arked with a black pencil, becom es a  survey  line. The area occlusal to the survey line is called the  suprabulge or  nonundercut area; the portion of a tooth cervical to a survey line is called the  infrabulge or  undercut area (Figure 8.10). A clasp is m ade to flex in and out of an  undercut (Figure 8.11). The m etal’s resistance to flexing is responsible for m ost of the clasp’s retentive ability.   Figure 8.10. Survey Line.  Figure 8.11. Clasp-Engaging Undercut.  8.12.2.2. Groups of Clasps. There are two broad groups of cl asps—circumferential clasps and bar clasps. However, each may have three or more names that are used almost interchangeably. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  371 8.12.2.2.1. Circumferential Clasps (Suprabulge or Akers). The parts of a circum ferential clasp are the body, retentive arm , retentive tip,  reciprocal arm, and shoulders (Figure 8.12). The retentive tip of a circumferential clasp consists of the terminal one-third of the retentive arm; the shoulder is the one-third of a clcharacteristic of this clasp group is that the retentive arm approaches the undercut area of the tooth from above the survey line. asp arm  closest to the body. The distinguishing  Figure 8.12. Circumferential Clasp Parts.  8.12.2.2.2. Bar Clasps (Infrabulge or Roach). Bar clasps approaches the tooth’s undercut area from below the survey line. The approach arm usually exits the framework from an area designed to hold artificial teeth. Instead of th e retentive arm being continuous with the body as in the circumferential clasp, the retentive tip of a bar clasp is continuous with its approach arm (Figure 8.13). The parts of  a bar clasp m ay include the body, approach arm , retentive tip, bracing tip, reciprocal arm , and shoulder (as in the T-bar), or it m ay include only an approach arm and retentive tip (as in the I-bar). 8.12.3. Functional Requirements of a Clasp. Clasps are expected to perform  the following four functions: 8.12.3.1. Retention—the ability to resist removal of the RPD in an occlusal direction.  8.12.3.2.  Reciprocation—the means by which a nonretentive pa rt of an RPD counteracts the lateral forces exerted on the abutment tooth by the retentive arm.  8.12.3.3. Bracing—the resistance the clasp contributes to  anteroposterior and lateral shifting of the entire RPD. 8.12.3.4.  Encirclement—a design principle where m ore than  180 degrees of an abutm ent’s circumference is surrounded so the tooth does not drift from  the confines of the clasp (Figure 8.14).  372  Figure 8.13. Parts of a Bar Clasp. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 8.14. Encirclement.  8.12.4. Other Requirements of a Clasp. Clasps may be the most difficult component of the RPD to properly construct. As much as possible, they must be hidden from view in the patient’s mouth, be sufficiently strong, and blend into the existing contour of the natural teeth. 8.12.5. Relative Importance of Retention, Reciprocation, Bracing, and Support: 8.12.5.1. Retention prevents occlusal movement of the RPD.  8.12.5.2. Reciprocation prevents horizontal movement of individual teeth.  8.12.5.3. Bracing prevents the RPD from moving horizontally.  8.12.5.4. Support prevents vertical movement of the RPD toward the gingival tissues.  8.12.5.5. Of these factors, retention is the least important, because horizontal and tissue-ward movement can dam age the teeth, tissues, a nd underlying bone, causing loss of the rem aining teeth. Excessive retention m ay also cause dam age. In the absence of adequate bracing and support, the effectiveness of retention is reduced because the RPD m oves m ore when the AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  373 patient chews. Patients usually desire firm  rete ntion and m ay ask the dentist to increase the retention of the RPD, further aggrava ting the situation. Because patients often  may not notice the damage their RPD does to their m outh, it is usually desirable to use the least am ount of retention they can tolerate. 8.12.6. Mechanics of Retention and Reciprocation. An RPD tends to remain seated in the mouth because clasp arms that carry retentive tips resist  flexing when the tips are forced to m ove out of undercuts. The retentive tip of a clasp arm is the only part of an RPD intentionally made to fit into an undercut area. Alm ost all other parts of thust be constructed to avoid undercuts. The shoulder of a circumferential clasp’s retentive arm is the zone of transition between the rigid “body” and the flexib le “tip.” A shoulder has some spring to it, but not m uch. The parts of a clasp cannot be positioned random ly on an abutm ent tooth’s surface because each part has a definite relationship with the survey line.  e RPD are not supposed to flex and m8.12.6.1.

One way to effectively is m ore flexible and places less stress on thlengthen a clasp is to follow the gingival contour of the tooth. In addition to traveling the mesial-distal dim ension of the tooth, the clasp  also travels the occlusal-gingival distance. Because only the retentive tip should be below th e survey line and most natural teeth have a high survey line at the line angles, the dentist m ust alter the shape of the tooth to change the height of contour. This change will allow the technician to place all parts of the clasp except the retentive tip above the survey line.  8.12.6.1.2. Figure 8.15 illustrates an independent rewere constructed to engage undercut. The clasp resists rem oval from  the tooth with no assistance from other parts of the RPD.  Clasps are not ordinarily designed this way. This design would be used only if there are natural  teeth remaining on just one side of the mouth. If this clasp design is used, the retentive ar ms will push the abutm ent tooth laterally when the RPD is inserted or rem oved. This kind of stress can lead to irreparable abutm ent tooth and supporting bone damage.  tentive clasp unit in which both arm s  Figure 8.15. Independently Retentive Clasp.  8.12.6.1.3. Instead of having two arm s with rete ntive capability, clasps are built with one retentive arm  and one reciprocal arm .

This is how  the retentive and reciprocal arms of a simple circumferential clasp relate to a survey line m ost of the time (Figure 8.16). Observe that the shoulder of the retentive arm  is positioned above  the survey line and the retentive tip goes into undercut. The cervical border of the entire reciprocal arm falls on the survey line.  8.12.6.1.4. Figure 8.17 illustrates the way the arm s of  a bar clasp norm ally relate to the survey line. The approach arm  crosses gingival tissue at 90 degrees and m akes first contact with the tooth at the survey line. The retebracing tip (if present) is positioned in the supr abulge area.

The  Figure 8.17. Relationship of Bar Clasp Arms to the Survey Line.   AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  375 8.12.6.1.5. As stated in paragraph 8.12.6.1.2, clasps  with both arms engaging undercuts are independent retentive units. However, there are  serious drawbacks to using clasps this way. The typical circum ferential and bar clasps just described are not independently retentive. When considered in isolation from  other part s of the RPD, clasps with one arm  above the survey line and the other arm below the survey line may not be retentive. 8.12.6.2. Interactions Among Clasps: 8.12.6.2.1. The m ost effective retention is rea lized by selecting opposing undercut surfaces on two or m ore teeth, placing the retentive tip s of the clasps on those surfaces, and uniting the clasps with rigid connectors. The result is  a retentive com plex where the action of one clasp is opposed by the action of another to geReciprocation and bracing requirem ents of combinations of opposing surfaces are buccal  to buccal, cross arch (Figure 8.18-A), lingual to lingual, cross arch (Figure 8.18-B), and bu ccal to lingual on the sam e side opposed by a buccal or lingual surface undercut on the opposite side.  nerate retention for the RPD as a whole. the RPD are also satisfied. The possible  Figure 8.18. Examples of Opposing Clasps.  8.12.6.2.2. In Figure 8.19, the buccal undercut on th e right second m olar (A) opposes the lingual surface undercut of the second prem olar on the sam e side (B), and the buccal undercut of the right second m olar (A) also opposes the buccal undercut of the second premolar on the opposite side (C). 8.12.6.3. Reciprocal Plating as an Alternative to Reciprocal Arms (Figure 8.20). There are oral conditions that limit the use of a clasp arm for reciprocation purposes. Three such solutions are as follows: 8.12.6.3.1. In the first situation, the retentive arm  makes contact with the tooth m uch earlier than the reciprocal arm  as the partial dentur e is going to place. There is a need for m ore effective reciprocation than a reciprocal  clasp arm  can provide.  Conversely, during RPD removal the retentive arm  exerts pressure on the abutm ent long after the reciprocal arm  breaks contact. A second situation occurs when the abutm ent tooth is very short without enough room  for a reciprocal arm  of sufficient width. In the third situation, the gingival border of a reciprocal arm and the edge of a major connector are within 6 mm of each other, creating a food trap.   376  Figure 8.19. Opposing Undercuts on the Same and Opposite Sides. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 8.20. Proximal View.  8.12.6.3.2. When any of these situations exist, it is common to make the gingival border of a reciprocal arm and the edge of the m ajor connector continuous with one another. The result of this joining is called a reciprocal plate. The reciprocal plate has a different relationship to the survey line than a reciprocal arm . The supe rior edge of a reciprocal plate is slightly occlusal to the survey line.  8.12.6.4. Exceptions to the Usual Clasp Arm-Survey Line Relationships. When clasps are to be used for support, but not for retention, bot h buccal and lingual clasp arm s are placed above the survey lines like reciprocating arm s. In this  case, they function to prevent the tooth from  migrating away from  the supporting rest. Occasiona lly, a patient will have all of the teeth in one quadrant missing. Cross arch undercut antagonism is impossible. In this case, each clasp is made with two retentive arm s, one on the buccal  and the other on the lingual of the tooth the clasp engages. 8.12.6.5.  Generating  Specific  Amounts  of  Retention  With  Clasps. If clasps do not act to retain the RPD, the RPD tends to lift off the teeth. On the other hand, too m uch retention can cause severe tooth abrasion, intolerable tooth  soreness, loss of bone support around abutm ents, and varying amounts of difficulty when the RPD is put in or taken out. The amount of retention that the clasp shows depends on the flexibility of  the retentive arm and the amount of undercut engaged. 8.12.6.5.1.  Clasp  Arm  Flexibility. In this case, fexhibited by a retentive arm  passing over a tooth’s height of contour. The general lexibility is the resistance to bending AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  is that retention increases as frelationship between fdecreases. The following four factors that influence the clasp arm’s flexibility: lexibility and retention 377 lexibility 8.12.6.5.1.1. The first is the  length of the arm. As length increases, f lexibility increases and retention decreases.  8.12.6.5.1.2.  Cross-sectional  size  is another factor. As cross-sectional size increases, flexibility decreases and retention increases. Clasp arms must be made with a progressive reduction in cross-sectional size from shoulder to tip. This is why the tip can flex and the shoulder cannot flex. Progressive reduction in  cross-sectional size is called uniformity of taper. It is critical that there be no interrup tion in the uniformity of taper by thick or thin areas (Figure 8.21).  8.12.6.5.1.3. A third consideration is the clasp arm ’s cross-sectional shape. Clasp arm s with round cross-sectional shapes are m ore  flexible than clasp arm s with half-round shapes.  type  of  metal  used. A dentist has access to three 8.12.6.5.1.4. The fourth factor is the kinds of m etals for clasp construction;  cast chrom e-alloy, cast gold, and noncorrosive wires. (The wires are cut and bent into the shape of clasp arms and then incorporated into the chrome-alloy or gold castings.) Cast chrome-alloy is the stiffest per unit length, wires are the m ost flexible, and the relative f lexibility of cast gold f alls between the two. The stiffer the metal, the greater the retention.  Figure 8.21. Uniform Taper.  8.12.6.5.2. Tooth Undercut as a Factor in Retention. An undercut is the portion of a tooth that is cervical to the survey line. The am ount of undercut, progressing from the survey line cervically, usually increases. As retentive tips engage greater am ounts of undercut, the retention increases.  8.12.6.5.2.1. The dentist and the technician must be able to measure undercut to maintain control over the am ount of fram ework retention. The am ount of undercut at any given point on the infrabulge surface of a tooth is  the perpendicular distance between a vertical line that touches the tooth’s height of contour and the point in question (Figure 8.22-A).  8.12.6.5.2.2. The unit of undercut m easurement is  thousandths-of-an  inch. Undercut is measured with an undercut gauge m ounted in an instrum ent called a  surveyor. Undercut 378  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 gauges are produced in standard .010, .020 0.005 and .015 inch gauges are custom  made and have been found to be very satisfactory intermediate amounts of undercut for certain clasping situations.  and .030 inch sizes (Figure 8.22-B). The 8.12.6.5.3. Clasp Type and Retention. In general, bar clasps produce m ore retention per undercut unit than circumferential clasps, even though bar clasps tend to be longer and more flexible. An analogy would be pushing the tip pulling or dragging it. The tip of the bar clasp when an attempt is made to withdraw it. 8.12.6.5.4.  Integrating  Clasp  Arm  Flexibility  and  Tooth  Undercut  To  Achieve Retention. The retentive tip of a clasp is positioned on a tooth’s surface relative to a measured amount of undercut (Figure 8.22-C). of a stick along a sidewalk as opposed to tends to engage into the surface of the tooth 8.12.6.5.4.1. The ability to control the degree of framework retention depends on whether flexibility and undercut variables are m anipulated to advantage. All of the variables mentioned can be controlled, but the ones that  most immediately influence retention are the choice of m etal for clasp construction, length of the clasp arm , and am ount of undercut engaged.  Figure 8.22. Measurement of Undercut.  8.12.6.5.4.2. The relationship among these variables is important. For example, placing a cast chrome alloy clasp into .010 inch unde rcut should produce roughly the same amount of framework retention as placing the sam e sized gold clasp in an .020 inch undercut. Wrought wire would require .020 inch undercut to produce the sam e retention, but the dentist is usually attem pting to reduce the  stress on the abutm ent when using wire and will choose less undercut.  8.12.6.5.4.3. Clasp arm length is the variable that probably changes m ost from abutment tooth to abutment tooth. If the retentive ar ea on a tooth like a large m olar is longer than average, more undercut than the norm  for the  type of metal must be engaged to produce sufficient retention (.015 inch instead of .010 fo r chrome-alloy). The reverse is true when retentive arms are shorter than average (.005 inch to .010 inch for chrome-alloy metal).  8.12.6.5.4.4. It is the responsibility of the dentist to  prescribe the type of clasp assem bly and amount of retentive undercut to be used. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  379 8.12.6.6.  Clarification  of  Terms. The term   clasp  properly refers to an RPD com ponent consisting of a retentive part, reciprocacomplex of parts consisting of a clasp, restassembly (Figure 8.8). 8.12.6.7. Types of Circumferential Class Assemblies: , and m inor connector is correctly called a  clasp ting part, and body (Figures 8.12 and 8.13). The 8.12.6.7.1. Simple Circumferential Assembly (Figure 8.23). This assem bly is com posed of two clasp arm s, a rest and a m inor conn ector. It is the m ost com monly used clasp assembly. 8.12.6.7.2.  Embrasure  (Crib)  Assembly  (Figure  8.24). This assem bly consists of  two simple circumferential clasps, two rests, and  one minor connector. The rests are located in adjacent triangular fossae and m arginal ridges of two teeth; the sim ple circum ferential clasps are joined at their bodies. Em brasure clasps are weaker than other clasp assem blies and tend to fracture where the minor connectors cross the buccal or lingual marginal ridges. 8.12.6.7.3.  Ring  With  Supporting  Strut  (Ring  Clasp)  Assembly  (Figure  8.25). In this assembly, a single arm almost completely encircles the abutment tooth. A reinforcing strut is attached to the arm  midway between the m inor connector and the retentive tip. Mesial and distal occlusal rests are another feature of this assem bly. A com mon variations is to not place the supporting strut.  Figure 8.23. Simple Circumferential Assembly.  Figure 8.24. Embrasure (Crib) Assembly.  380  Figure 8.25.

This is basically a sim ple circumferential clasp assembly with a retentive arm that turns back on itself and engages an undercut gingival to its shoulder. This clasp c overs a lot of tooth structure and requires a long clinical crown. When used on the buccal of a m andibular tooth, it frequently interferes with the maxillary buccal cusps. This clasp should be avoided. 8.12.6.7.5.  Half-and-Half  (Split)  Clasp  Assembly  (Figure  8.27).

The distinctive feature of this assembly is that two sim ple circumferential clasps oppose each other and are joined at the terminal ends of the reciprocal arms. 8.12.6.7.7. Combination Circumferential Assembly (Figure 8.29). Instead of both arm s being cast in metal, this simple circumferential clasp assembly uses a wire retentive arm and cast reciprocating arm . This assem bly is com monly used on an abutm ent next to a distal extension space. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 8.27. Half-and-Half (Split) Clasp Assembly. 381  Figure 8.28. Multiple Circumferential Assembly.  Figure 8.29. Combination Circumferential Assembly.   8.12.6.8. Types of Bar Clasp Assemblies: 8.12.6.8.1. T-Bar Assembly (Figure 8.30). The T-bar clasp assem bly has a rest, reciprocal arm, and m inor connector as extensions from  the body. An approach arm  carries retentive and bracing tips. The approach arm  originates in a denture base of the RPD. The clasp gets its name from the appearance of the approach arm and its tips. 382  Figure 8.30. T-Bar Assembly. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  8.12.6.8.2. Modified T-Bar Assembly (Figure 8.31). This is merely a T-bar clasp assembly with the approach arm ’s bracing tip rem oved. Although the bracing effectiveness of the bar clasp depends on the stiffness of the recipro cal and approach arm s, some bracing action is lost by omitting the approach arm’s bracing tip.  Figure 8.31. Modified T-Bar Assembly.   8.12.6.8.3. I-Bar Assembly (Figure 8.32). The retentive and bracing tips associated with the approach arm  of a T-bar clasp are gone. Instead, the end of the approach arm  is the retentive tip of this kind of clasp. 8.12.6.8.4. RPI Clasp Assembly (Figure 8.33). This is a com mon variation of the basic I-bar form. It is com posed of a m esial rest and  a minor connector, a distal plate, and an I-bar retentive portion. The clasp has no reciprocal arm. Reciprocation comes from the distal plate and the m edial m inor connector. I-bar and  RPI clasp assem blies are com monly used on abutment teeth adjacent to distal extension  bases. One reason for changing the T-bar clasp assembly configuration into m odified “T” and  “I” bar varieties was to m ake the clasps less conspicuous in the mouth. 8.12.6.8.5. Combination Bar Assembly (Figure 8.34). The combination bar is another “I” configuration. It consists of a wire approach arm and a cast reciprocal arm.  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 8.32. I-Bar Assembly. 383  Figure 8.33. RPI Clasp Assembly.  Figure 8.34. Combination Bar Assembly.   8.12.6.9. Rationale for the Variety of Clasp Assemblies. Factors such as occlusion, esthetics, and the presence of gingival tissue undercuts can restrict the access of retentive tips to abutment tooth undercuts of proper location and depth. The dentist usually chooses a clasp assembly that will put the least stress possible on the abutment tooth next to an extension base. The variety of circum ferential and bar clasp asse mblies should be viewed as an assortm ent of options for retaining an RPD in the best manner possible. The details of using the assemblies to their best advantage are in paragraphs 8.27 and 8.35. 384  8.13.  Indirect  Retainers. Up to this point, characteristics ofHowever, indirect retention is another important principle in RPD design.  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  direct retention have been outlined. e axis of rotation (fulcrum  line), resulting in decreased 8.13.1. An indirect retainer is a part of an extension base RPD which inhibits the extension base from lifting off the ridge tissue. This  indirect retention occurs because the indirect retainer resists the rotation of the RPD around thmovement and increased stability of  the RPD.  The improved stability im proves the ef fectiveness of the direct retention. Movem ent of a toothborne  RPD in an occlusal direction is prevented by clasps on abutment teeth located at each end of the edentulous space.  8.13.2. Distal extension base RPDs tend to rotate around an axis that passes through the distal abutment on each side (Figure 8.35-A  and -B). In an anterior extension case, the axis of rotation passes through the most anterior abutment on each side of the arch. If stic ky food is acting to pull an extension base away from  the ridge tissue, th e part of the RPD on the  opposite side of the axis of rotation tends to rotate toward the gingival tissue if that part is unsupported.  8.13.3. The most effective indirect retention featur es are additional rests placed opposite the axis of rotation from  the extension base (Figure 8.36).  All extension base RPDs should have indirect retention built into them. The farther away from the axis of rotation the indirect retentive f eatures are, the more effective they are.   Figure 8.35. Axes of Rotation.  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 8.36. Principle of Indirect Retention. 385  8.14.  Bracing  Components.

The purpose of an RPD is to replace natural teeth and tissue. Natural tooth and tissue replacem ents must be joined to the framework in some way. The dentist indicates how the artificial replacement teeth and tissue are to be attached.  8.15.1. The replacem ents are generally com posed  of artificial denture teeth, acrylic resin replacement tissue, and metal support and retention components as follows: 8.15.1.1. Artificial teeth m ay be plastic, porcelai n, com posite resin, or m etal. (However, porcelain teeth are rarely used anym ore because  of their tendency to chip, break and wear opposing natural teeth.) Tooth replacem ents may be made using m etal, tooth-colored m ethyl methacrylate resin, or other esthetic com posite resin veneering m aterials, such as Sym phony®. But most commonly, stock denture teeth are used. 8.15.1.2. Pink acrylic resin (heat-cured or self-ctissue and attach artificial teeth to the framework. 8.15.1.3. Metal support and retaining com ponents may include beads, posts, rods, m esh, and bars.  uring) is norm ally used to replace m issing 8.15.2. Selection of the method of tooth and tissue replacement is based on the space available, the strength required, esthetic considerations, and futu re needs for m odifying or adding to the RPD. Common combinations of artificial teeth, denture ba se materials, and attachm ent methods are as follows: anterior areas where there is average or 8.15.2.1. Reinforced acrylic pontic (RAP) used in limited room and biting force is more than normal. This is one of the strongest replacements for anterior teeth. A RAP is m ade from a denture t ooth and is attached to the fram ework using a metal backing. 8.15.2.2. Plastic denture teeth em bedded in denture  resin retained by an open retention grid. Open retention may be constructed from mesh or ladder-type retention. Open retention is often selected when there m ay be a future need to relin e the denture base area. It is also used when the dentist anticipates difficulty arranging the t eeth. Mesh is weaker than ladder-type retention, but is easier to adjust and fabricate.  8.15.2.3. Plastic denture teeth em bedded in denture resin retained by m etal beads that are part of a metal base. These are used when space is somewhat limited and/or when a metal surface is AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  387 is required, but the tim e to set RAPs is not desired against the tissue or additional strength justified.  8.15.2.4. Tooth-colored resin processed to a spiral retention post on a m etal base. Frequently referred to as a braided post, it is often used with beads for added retention. It is stronger than metal and beads alone. 8.15.2.5. Metal replacem ent teeth and a m etal base cast  with the rest of the  frame. This is the strongest tooth replacement and is used when sp ace is very limited. Because metal facial tooth surfaces are unsightly, the tooth is usually hollowe d out from the facial before it is cast. After casting, the facial surface is restored with appropriately shaded, tooth-colored resin. 8.15.2.6. Tube tooth (teeth) retained by a post on a  metal base. This com plex technique offers little advantage over a braided post with beads and  is much more difficult to fabricate. A metal base and post are f abricated to f it an artif icial tooth the dentist has correctly fitted to the patient’s mouth. A finish line is prepared on th e tooth, and a post hole is drilled into the tooth before the framework is made. The tooth is bonded to the framework with a self-curing resin. 8.15.3. Other considerations when selecting and fa bricating replacement tooth and tissue areas are as follows: 8.15.3.1. Minor connectors should extend from  the o cclusal surface of the abutm ent tooth, down the guide plane, and about 1 m m onto the gi ngival tissues when a resin denture base is used. Because the tooth-tissue junction is considered  to be vulnerable to disease, m etal in this area is usually kinder to the tissue than acrylic resin. 8.15.3.2. The finish line, where the m etal of the fr amework ends and the acrylic resin of the tooth replacement area begins, is critical. If a borde r of resin ends in a thin edge, this area will be weak and m ay chip or break. Therefore, a  1 mm thick finish line is placed in m etal where the resin starts. This f inish line allows the re sin to blend sm oothly with the m etal section and creates in the resin a 90-degree butt joint in thisexternal, depending on the location and extent ofsame. Metal bases have only external finish lines.  critical area. Finish lines are internal or  the resin, but the requirem ents remain the 8.16.  Major  Steps  in  RPD  Construction.  The following inform ation (and Figure 8.37) outline the major steps required to make an RPD: 8.16.1. The dentist m akes preliminary impressions of  the patient’s dental arches. The technician pours and trims the diagnostic casts. 8.16.2. The dentist perform s a survey procedure  on a diagnostic cast and com poses a tentative design. 8.16.3. Using the survey lines and other m arks on  the diagnostic case as a guide, the dentist prepares rest seats and alters the survey lines of teeth in the patient’s mouth. 8.16.4. If the dentist m akes m ajor changes in th e patient’s m outh, an im pression for another diagnostic cast may be made. The cast is resurveyed  to determine if modifications to the original design are required. 8.16.5. The dentist m akes a final im pression. (Some dentists use stock trays; others order custom  trays.) Then the technician pours a master cast. A master cast must be a precise, positive duplicate of the patient’s dental structures from which a prosthesis can be made. 8.16.6. Depending on the nature of the case, m aster casts might be mounted in an articulator. The procedure could require record bases and occlusion rims. 388  Figure 8.37. Major Steps in RPD Construction.

Undesirable tooth and soft tissue undercuts aradapted to the ridge areas under proposed retention grids. The blockout procedure consists of using a surveyor to fill in selected undercuts on a master cast with wax, tissue, or modeling clay. 8.16.10. A reversible hydrocolloid im pression is made of the blocked out m aster cast so it can be duplicated and poured in a heat-resistant investm ent material. A duplicate cast is poured, using a investment material is known as a refractory cast. 8.16.11. The refractory cast is dehydrated in an  oven and sealed by wax im mersion. The water within the cast is eliminated by heating in an oven, and the cast is sealed with beeswax. 8.16.12. The design is transferred from the master cast to the refractory cast. 8.16.13. The framework is constructed on the refractory cast with inlay wax and plastic patterns. 8.16.14. The refractory cast with the wax fram ework is  invested in a ring of investm ent material and put in a heated oven. The wax burns out of th e investment material, leaving a hole precisely the size and shape of the desired partial denture. 8.16.15. Chrome-alloy metal is melted and cast with centrifugal force into the hole. 8.16.16. The metal frame is broken out of the investment, cleaned, finished, and polished. 8.16.17.

The remaining steps are (1) setting the artific ial teeth, (2) waxing the denture bases, and (3) processing the denture base.

RPD Survey and Design: t with a surveyor to select the m8.18.1.  Survey. The survey consists of analyzing a casost favorable path of insertion (the direction of  travel the proposed RPD takes when going to place) and then m arking cast features such as abutm ent tooth undercuts necessary for retention, the heights of contour of the remaining natural teeth, and soft tissue heights of contour. 8.18.2.  Design. The design procedure involves m aking  selections am ong various com ponents using the survey procedures as a basis for choice  and then combining component selections into a single, workable entity and drawing the design on the cast. 8.18.3.  Survey  Versus  Design.  If the definition of  design  is narrowly confined to drawing an illustration of the proposed RPD on a cast, then  designing does properly follow  surveying. What really happens is that a m ental picture of the de sign forms while the survey is in progress. W hen the survey is finished, the design should be virtually com plete in the m ind’s eye. Drawing the design is almost anticlimactic. 8.19. Dental Surveyor: 8.19.1. Purposes of a Surveyor: 8.19.1.1.  Survey  the  Cast.

This tool has no ability to m easure the amount of undercut. 8.19.3.2. Carbon Marker. The marker is a black pencil lead used to mark survey lines on teeth and soft tissue surfaces of the cast after the path of insertion has been chosen (Figure 8.40). 8.19.3.3.  Undercut  Gauges. Standard undercut gauges co me in three sizes; .010, .020, and .030 inch. Gauges of .005 and .015 inch are freque ntly custom made. The amount of undercut needed to produce a standard am ount of resistance to clasp rem oval is directly proportional to the f lexibility of  the retentive arm . To com pensate f or variations in clasp arm  f lexibility, different amounts of tooth undercut are engaged. A ten thousandth of an inch undercut (.010) is used most often. A twenty thousandth of an inch  undercut (.020) is used with long or delicate clasps, such as 19-gauge wrought wi re. A thirty thousandth of an inch undercut (.030) is rarely used.  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 8.39. Surveying Tools. 393  Figure 8.40. Marking a Survey Line With a Carbon Marker.   8.19.3.3.1. Desirable Undercuts. A desirable undercut  is an area of undercut on a tooth’s surface that has sufficient depth, suitable location, and reasonable accessibility in relation to clasp assemblies chosen for the RPD design. There are many zones on the infrabulge surface of a tooth where the retentive tips of various  clasp types m ight be positioned. For exam ple, I-bar clasps are frequently used to engage  undercuts located in the  midfacial surfaces of a tooth. The m ost com mon zones to check for desirable undercuts are the m esiofacial, midfacial, and distofacial (Figure 8.41). When undercuts are not available on facial surfaces, mesiolingual, midlingual, or distolingual undercuts may be used. 394  Figure  8.41.  Mesiofacial  (A),  Midfacial  (B),  and  Distofacial  (C)  Zones  of  Undercut  on  a  Lower Molar. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  8.19.3.3.2.  Undesirable  Undercuts. Undesirable undercuts are all tooth and soft tissue undercuts along the path of insertion that are not used for retention. The rigid parts of an RPD must not contact undesirable undercuts when  going to place. If the rigid parts of the RPD were constructed to conform  to tooth  and tissue undercuts, the RPD would not seat. Undesirable undercuts m ay also distort the  hydrocolloid during duplication. Undesirable undercuts are eliminated in the blockout and duplication phases of RPD construction. 8.19.3.3.3. Positioning a Clasp Tip Within a Zone of Desirable Undercut (Figure 8.42). Undercut gauges consist of a shaft and a lip. W hen contact of the shaft at the tooth’s height of contour and contact of the lip with the inf rabulge surface happen at the sam e time, the amount of undercut specified by the undercut gauge  is present at the lip’s point of contact with the tooth. The tip of a clasp’s retentive arm should be positioned on that spot. 8.19.3.4. Blockout Tools. All tooth and soft tissue undercuts are subject to blockout except in the infrabulge area between a retentive tip’s cer vical border and the survey line. The blockout procedure is accom plished with blockout tools m ounted in the vertical spindle of a surveyor. There are two types of blockout tools; (1) a parallel or (0 degrees) blockout tool, and (2) a tapered tool that ranges from  2 to 6 degrees. Ta pered tools are occasionally used to block out undesirable undercuts beneath m inor connectors that  are part of clasp assem blies or lead to auxiliary rests. 8.20. Knowledge of Survey and Design Principles: 8.20.1. A thorough knowledge of survey and design prin ciples has value for m any reasons. It is necessary to understand all types of instructions  and interpret the dentist’s design drawn on the cast. The technician is responsible for accurately  transferring a design from  the diagnostic cast to the master and refractory casts.  8.20.2. The starting point for this discussion is a diagnostic cast poured from  a prelim inary impression. No rest seats have been cut into th e patient’s natural teeth because m any acceptable designs are possible. The design process should indi cate the location of rest seats rather than the location of rest seats dictating the design.  8.20.3. Once the dentist cuts the rest seats, thindication that the dentist has a definite RPD design in mind. The RPD should be kept as simple as possible; components should not be added without a reason. e design possibilities are reduced. This is an AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 8.42.

Procedures for Arriving at an RPD Design Drawn on a Cast: (NOTE: The 17 procedures listed in the following subparagraphs are further detailed in paragraphs 8.22 through 8.38.) 8.21.1. Evaluate the relationship between the m axillary and mandibular casts in centric occlusion (paragraph 8.22). 8.21.2. Decide which artificial tooth and tissue repl acements are best suited to the case (paragraph 8.23). 8.21.3. Classify the case according to the Word Picture System (paragraph 8.24). 8.21.4. Determine the need for indirect retention (paragraph 8.25). 8.21.5. Tentatively pick a major connector (paragraph 8.26). 8.21.6. Determine how many clasp assemblies are needed and make a preliminary judgment about their placement (paragraph 8.27). 8.21.7. Identify surfaces to use as guide planes (paragraph 8.28). 8.21.8. Choose a path of insertion to confirm an occlusal plane tilt (paragraph 8.29). 8.21.9. Limit and improve the tilt (paragraph 8.30). 8.21.10. Place tripod marks on the cast (paragraph 8.31). 8.21.11.

Protect the design from smudging (paragraph 8.38). 396  8.22.  Evaluate  the  Relationship  Between  the  Maxillary  and  Mandibular  Casts  in  Centric Occlusion. A patient might require only one RPD, but a treatment plan should never be initiated without access to the opposing cast. W hen maxillary and mandibular casts are oriented in centric occlusion, the technician will: AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 ited, tissue and tooth replacem ents should be chosen 8.22.1. Observe how much vertical space is available  in the tissue and tooth replacem ent areas. If opposing ridges contact (the m axillary tuberosity t ouches the retrom olar pad in distal extension cases) or natural teeth touch an opposing ridge, an  RPD cannot be m ade until the dentist corrects the problem . If vertical space is limaccordingly. 8.22.2. When designing a m axillary RPD, indicate th e amount of vertical overlap between upper and lower anterior teeth by drawing a black line  on the lingual surfaces of  the maxillary anterior teeth where the m andibular teeth contact. This pe ncil line helps m ake the decision for or against maxillary major connectors with lingual plating. Th e line also shows the dentist which surfaces to avoid when cutting the rest seats. 8.22.3. Make a m ental note of those areas wher e the stam p cusps do not contact the opposing teeth. These areas best accommodate rests and clasp bodies that transverse occlusal embrasures. 8.23. Decide Which Artificial Tooth and Tissue Replacements Are Best Suited to the Case: 8.23.1.  Criteria. The criteria for choice am ong the com mon denture base and artificial tooth combinations are as follows: 8.23.1.1. The amount of space present between the cr est of the residual ridge and the opposing arch—a very important factor. 8.23.1.2. Esthetic values. 8.23.1.3. The presence of soft tissue undercuts. 8.23.1.4. The length of the edentulous span. 8.23.1.5. The general condition of the residual ridgeanticipated rates of bone resorption. A ridge proba bly resorbs m ost during the first year after extractions are performed. An RPD made at this time will probably require relining sooner than usual.  in term s of soft tissue health and 8.23.2.  Anterior  Area  Tooth  and  Tissue  Replacements  (Figure  8.43). A prim ary factor in selecting anterior replacements is esthetic acceptability.  8.23.2.1. RAP Retained on a Metal Base (Figure 8.43-A):  8.23.2.1.1. This system uses denture teeth that ar e ground to fit the edentulous space. They are then attached to the metal frame with tooth-colored resin.  8.23.2.1.2. RAPs look very natural, and there is a  great variety of denture tooth m olds and shades to choose from . Good three-dim ensional effects, such as overlapping the teeth, are possible. Repairs or additions with identical replacements are possible because stock denture teeth are used. The presence of facial soft tissue undercuts does not prohibit their use.    AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 8.43. Anterior Area Tooth and Tissue Replacement. 397  cated in cases where the residual ridge is 8.23.2.1.3. RAPs can be used when space between the residual ridge and opposing natural teeth is lim ited; however, they are not indisignificantly resorbed or severely dam aged. RAPs should not be used in long spans where they tend to get m ore support from  underlying  tissue than from  abutm ent teeth. Because RAPs have lim ited reline potential, residual ri dges should be well healed when RAPs are proposed.  8.23.2.1.4. RAPs require m ore preparation before  the RPD fram ework is m ade. The teeth must be selected, carefully ground to fit, and  set on the m aster cast. The dentist m ay desire to try the teeth in the patient’s m outh so th ey can be previewed before the fram ework is made. A m atrix must be prepared to relate the teeth to the m aster cast, refractory cast, and framework. Despite the extra work, RAPs are of ten the preferred anterior tooth replacem ent because of their strength, esthetics, and versatility. 8.23.2.2. Processed Tooth-Colored Resin Attached to a Metal Base:  8.23.2.2.1. One method is to first carve replacem ent teeth in white, nonstaining wax on the metal fram e as part of the denture base wax-up procedure. These teeth are subsequently processed in suitably shaded resin.  8.23.2.2.2. In another technique, the replacemframework. A window is carved out of the fplaced.

A third m ethod is to process light cu red composite resin around a braided post (Figure 8.43-B). This gives the technician great versatility as far as staining and contours are concerned.  8.23.2.2.4. As is true for RAPs, processed resin t eeth can be used if undesirable soft tissue undercuts are present or when space is lim ited; they cannot be used in cases where the residual ridge has becom e flabby or reduced in  size. A major drawback to this procedure is that carving and color characterizing the teeth strong, wear resistant or stain resistant as stoc k plastic denture teeth; but unusual situations sometimes require this technique be used. All things considered, RAPs are better solutions. 8.23.2.3.  Plastic  Denture  Teeth  Plus  Denture  Resin  Attached  by  Using  an  Open  Cast Metal Retention Grid (Figure 8.43-C): is difficult. The processed resin is not as 8.23.2.3.1. Uses:  8.23.2.3.1.1. This type of artificial substitute is used because it is an excellent way to compensate for grossly resorbed or m isshapen residual ridges. The tissue surface of the denture resin saddle can be relined. The coverage provided by a resin base serves support and bracing functions in long span edentulous areas.  8.23.2.3.1.2. Denture teeth em bedded in resin dent ure bases have their lim itations. The combination requires a lot of space between the residual ridge and opposing teeth. The denture base’s labial flange should extend to  the sulcus. This requirem ent cannot be m et when deep facial soft tissue undercuts are present.  8.23.2.3.1.3. Denture teeth em bedded in resin base s are not as esthetic as RAPs or facings. If the vertical junction line between the border of the denture base and the gingiva f alls near the m idline of  the ar ch, the junction will be visible. The only possibilities for concealing the junction line are flange without creating a knife edge and to m atch, as closely as possible, the color of the denture base to the adjacent tissue. to thin out the lateral borders of the 8.23.2.3.2. Types of Open Retention Grid: 8.23.2.3.2.1. Ladder retention is m ade of struts that  cross the edentulous ridge. It is the strongest open retention, very versatile, easily constructed, and the most commonly used. 8.23.2.3.2.2. Mesh retention is m ade from  com mercially prefabricated plastic patterns. These patterns can be applied quickly during the wax-up process. Mesh is useful when less vertical space is available than is ideal  for ladder retention. W hen denture teeth are being set on the fram ework, som e of the m esh m ay be cut away without significantly affecting the strength of the retention grid. Me sh does not retain the acrylic resin denture base as well as ladder retention.  8.23.2.4. Plastic Denture Teeth Plus Denture Resin Retained by Metal Beads on a Metal Base (Figure 8.43-D). This option is used when space is at a prem ium. Metal beads on a thin metal base take up less room  than resin retenti on grids. Metal beads do not retain the resin to the framework as well as open retention or RAPs.  A braided or “spiral” post is sometimes used to increase retention of the denture teeth to the metal base. 8.23.2.5. Commercial Facings Retained on a Metal Backing With a Cementing Medium:  8.23.2.5.1. Facings are prefabricated in m any molds and colors. One advantage of facings is AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  399 that repairs with identical replacem ents are re latively sim ple. The presence of facial soft tissue undercuts does not prohibit their use.  8.23.2.5.2. Facings can be used when space between the residual ridge and opposing natural teeth is extrem ely limited. Facings cannot be us ed where the residual ridge is significantly resorbed or severely damaged. They should not be used in long spans where they tend to get more support from underlying tissue than from abutment teeth.  8.23.2.5.3. Because facings have no reline potential, residual ridges should be well healed when facings are proposed.  NOTE: Facings are becom ing difficult to find because of the popularity of simpler methods, such as RAPs. 8.23.3. Posterior Area Tooth and Tissue Replacements (Figure 8.44). Space is alm ost always at a premium in posterior areas. The selection of  substitutes for missing posterior teeth and tissue is usually driven by a lack of space. Following are several options for posterior replacements: 8.23.3.1.  Plastic  Denture  Teeth  Plus  Denture  Resin  Attached  to  an  Open  Cast  Metal Retention  Grid  (Figure  8.44-A). Overall, this is the m ost com monly used replacem ent combination for long-span defects. It requireopposing arches for proper fabrication and is popular because: s a fair am ount of vertical height between 8.23.3.1.1.

Metal Teeth and a Metal Base Carved and Cast as a Unit with the Rest of the Frame  (Figure  8.44-B). Cast m etal bases fit against underlying tissue m ore accurately than processed plastic. In addition, this replacem ent combination needs the least am ount of room  between opposing arches and is by far the str ongest tooth replacem ent. Conversely, the tissue surface of the base cannot be relined, and the overwhelm ing display of m etal is often objectionable. Space perm itting, metal posterior t eeth can be cast as hollowed-out shells and tooth-colored resin used to form the facial surfaces.  Figure 8.44. Posterior Area Tooth and Tissue Replacements.  400  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 8.23.3.3. Processed Tooth-Colored Resin With Loop or Braided (Spiral) Post Retention on a Metal Base (Figure 8.44-C). This combination is ordinarily used in short span situations as a substitute for tube teeth. A possible advantage of the processed resin replacem ent is that it requires slightly less interarch space than a tube  tooth for proper fabrication and is m uch easier to make. 8.24.  Classify  the  Case  According  to  the  Word  Picture  System.  According to paragraph 8.6 and Figure 8.2-A through -H, decide whether the case is classified as posterior unilateral toothborne, posterior bilateral toothborne, anterior toothborne,  combination toothborne, unilateral distal extension, bilateral distal extension, anterior extension, or combination extension. 8.25.  Determine  the  Need  for  Indirect  Retention. Indirect retention should be part of the design whenever there is an extension base. Decide whether indirect retention is necessary and tentatively determine how to achieve it. An RPD rest can serve as indirect retention whether it is an auxiliary rest or part of a clasp assembly. Lingual plating generally doe s not provide adequate indirect retention because it rests on an inclined plane, unless rest seats are included in the plated anterior teeth. 8.25.1. Distal Extension Cases:  8.25.1.1. In the m axillary arch, the auxiliary rest s eats most often cut for indirect retention in distal extension cases are the cingulum  of a canin e; the m esial fossa of a first prem olar; and, possibly, the cingulum of a central incisor. In th e mandibular arch, they are the m esial fossa of a first prem olar; the m esio-incisal edge of a canin e; the m esio-incisal edge of an incisor; and, occasionally, the cingulum of the canine.  8.25.1.2. Incisal rests are not usually placed on maxillary anterior teeth. The rests are unsightly; and, in most cases, there is not enough room  for the minor connector of a maxillary incisal rest in centric occlusion.  8.25.1.3. In the m andibular arch, the m esial fossa of  the first prem olar takes precedence over the cingulum of a canine as a desirable rest seat because the cingulum enamel of a lower canine is relatively thin. The dentist runs a high risk  of cutting through enam el into the decay prone dentinal layer when preparing a rest seat. This  is not the case in the m axillary arch because the cingulum enamel of a canine is m uch thicker. Sometimes the dentist adds a cingulum  rest to a canine or incisor, using composite resin or other type of restoration. 8.25.2. Anterior Extension Cases. The rest seats m ost commonly used for indirect retention in anterior extension cases are bilateral occlusal rest  seats. They are placed as far posteriorly in the quadrants as possible. In these cases, the rests will almost always be part of a clasp assembly. 8.25.3.  Extension  Combination  Cases. It is dif ficult to achieve any indirect retention for the anterior extension-distal extension com bination situation. Because many natural teeth are m issing anterior and posterior to the axis of  rotation in  extension com bination cases, access to adequate indirect retention is severely limited. Minimal indirect retention is derived from broad coverage of displacement resistant tissue under denture bases and palatal major connectors. 8.25.3.1.  Maxillary  Arch. Anterior and posterior denture  bases (saddles) should cover the maximum area tolerable. (A full palatal m ajor connector is suggested.) If a closed horseshoe is used, the anterior part m ust cover the rugae and the posterior strap should be as broad as possible.  8.25.3.2. Mandibular Arch. The “teeter-totter” effect is more severe here than in the maxillary arch because no palatal strap is present to offset the m ovement of the anterior extension AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  401 incisally. Also, there are no firm  rugae to help  resist occlusal displacem ent of the distal extension. The only recourse available is m aximum coverage of anterior and posterior ridge areas, including as m uch of the buccal shelves and retrom olar pads as possible. There is nothing special about these m easures; such cove rage is required as good dental practice in many kinds of RPD cases. 8.26. Tentatively Pick a Major Connector: 8.26.1. Major Connector Choices in the Maxillary Arch: 8.26.1.1. Case Classification:  8.26.1.1.1. The anterior toothborne classification is probably the category that represents the least number of missing teeth, and the com bination extension is the category that represents the m ost m issing teeth. The edentulous spaces of caslength. Generally speaking, larger and sturdiermissing teeth increases.  8.26.1.1.2. W hile only a rough guide, the chart in Figure 8.45 shows as m any as three different major connectors that m ight be prope r for a m axillary RPD case. The size of  the edentulous spaces could be a factor that eliminates one of the choices. There are at least five more factors that would help an RPD designer “zero-in” on a single choice.  connectors are required as the num ber of es in an RPD classification vary in  Figure 8.45. Case Classification as a Factor in Choosing a Maxillary RPD Major Connector.  402  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 8.26.1.2. The Need for Indirect Retention in Distal Extension Cases. Such retention can be achieved by using an auxiliary rest suspended f rom the anterior edge of a strap or bar. Another method is to use the rests that are an integral part of the standard lingual plate design as indirect retainers. 8.26.1.3.  Occlusion. A lingual plate classically extends  one-third of the way up the lingual surfaces of the maxillary anterior teeth. Using  the vertical overlap line drawn on the lingual of the anteriors as a reference, any part of a lingua l plate that is positioned incisal to that line will probably interfere with normal contacts between upper and lower natural teeth. 8.26.1.4. Health of the Remaining Teeth. There are instances where som e of the rem aining to justify extraction. A lingual plate with its anterior teeth are loose, but not loose enough h in their sockets. If one or more of the associated rests can act to stabilize loose teetquestionable teeth under the plate are subsequen tly extracted, the RPD does not have to be remade. Instead, an artificial tooth can be attached to the plate. 8.26.1.5. Length of the Dental Arch. There is a large group of cases where a choice m ust be made between U-shaped m ajor connectors  and m ajor connectors having a closed “U” configuration. A long distance between an incisive papilla and the vibrating line favors selection of connectors having the additional rigi dity made possible by a posterior palatal bar segment. 8.26.1.6. Maxillary Torus. Avoid the torus by using horseshoe, anteroposterior palatal bar, or closed horseshoe connectors. Palatal straps and full palatal plates are contraindicated. 8.26.2.  Major  Connector  Choices  in  the  Mandibular  Arch. The choices are the lingual bar, lingual plating, and labial bar.  8.26.2.1. The basis for choosing is as follows: 8.26.2.1.1. The am ount of space between the sulcus and the gingival crests on the lingual aspect of the ridge. The conditions for use of  a lingual bar are (1) the superior border should clear the gingival m argins by 4 m m, and (2) the  inferior border should not  restrict the floor of the mouth’s normal mobility. If these conditions cannot be satisfied, select a lingual plate. 8.26.2.1.2. A need for indirect retention. Thelingual plate can act as indirect retainers in distal extension cases.   rests  that norm ally support the ends of a 8.26.2.2. Specific indicators for selecting a labial bar are: 8.26.2.2.1. Severe lingual inclination of mandibular incisors, 8.26.2.2.2. Severe, bilateral, lingual inclination of mandibular posterior teeth, 8.26.2.2.3. Lingual soft tissue contours that create unacceptably deep undercuts, or 8.26.2.2.4. The presence of very large m andibular  tori that cannot be rem oved for one reason or another. 8.27.

Rarely use m ore than two clasp assem blies per quadrant; one clasp assembly per quadrant is usually sufficient. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  403 8.27.1.2.  Location  of  Clasp  Assemblies. The preferred sites for clasp assem blies are teeth adjacent to edentulous spaces. Incisor teeth ar e a notable exception because they are weaker than posterior teeth and clasps placed on them tend to be visible. Incisors next to an edentulous space almost always have auxiliary rests placed on them, but are rarely clasped. 8.27.1.3.  Esthetics  of  Clasp  Assemblies. Patients do not like clasp assem blies that show. Sometimes, special clasp assem blies such as twin  flex clasps can be used to hide clasps. Canines can sometimes be clasped with a clasp  that engages a distobuccal undercut to hide the clasp from direct view. 8.27.1.4. Separation of Clasp Assemblies. If two clasp assem blies are indicated for use in a quadrant, use single clasps, separated by a distan ce of at least one tooth, to stabilize the fram e more effectively. (An embrasure clasp counts as two clasps.) 8.27.1.5.  Opposition  of  Retentive  Undercuts. Undercuts used for retention should oppose each other properly. Generally, buccal retention  on one side of the arch should be opposed by buccal retention on the other side. The same concept applies to lingual retention. 8.27.1.6.  Coverage  of  Tooth  and  Gingival  Tissues. Bar clasps contact less tooth area than circumferential clasps and m ay be a better choi ce if a patient has a high incidence of decay. Circumferential clasps cross the free gingival  margin fewer tim es than bar clasps and m ay create less food and plaque trap areas than bar clasps. 8.27.1.7. Periodontal Support. Circumferential clasps are stiffer than bar clasps or wrought wire clasps. Therefore, if the tooth has been w eakened from periodontal disease, a clasp that is less stiff may be desirable. 8.27.2. Clasp Assemblies Specifically Related to the Classification of the Case: 8.27.2.1. Toothborne RPD. A toothborne RPD allows a great  deal of flexibility in choosing the number and type of clasps. 8.27.2.1.1. Anterior Toothborne RPD. The first prem olar and first m olar in each quadrant are often clasped. Spreading the clasp assem blies as m uch as possible provides the best stability. 8.27.2.1.2.  Unilateral  Posterior,  Bilateral  Posterior,  and  Combination  Toothborne RPD:  8.27.2.1.2.1. In a quadrant where no posterior teeth are m issing, a clasp assem bly is placed on each of two posterior teeth and the a ssemblies are separated by a distance of at least one tooth. If a quadrant contains one posterior edentulous space, the teeth m esial and distal to the space are clasped. 8.27.2.1.2.2. If there are two posterior edentulous spaces on a side, the tooth mesial to the anterior space, and distal to the posterior space are normbetween  (intermediate  abutment)  is not clasped with a clasp that engages a retentive undercut. This is because this tooth is th e fulcrum around which the RPD m ay rotate and is subject to additional stress. The interm ediate abutment may be clasped if the arm s of the clasp are both constructed as reciprocal arms. ally clasped. The tooth in 8.27.2.2. Extension RPD: 8.27.2.2.1.  Unilateral  Distal  Extension  RPD. For unilateral distal extension cases, one clasp assembly is placed in the distal extension quadrant and one or two clasp assemblies are 404  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 placed on the toothborne side. On the side with  the distal extension defect, a clasp assem bly is placed on the most distal tooth present. On the toothborne side, follow rules already given for posterior toothborne RPDs (paragraph 8.27.2.1.2). 8.27.2.2.2.  Bilateral  Distal  Extension  RPD. One clasp assem bly is placed on the m ost distal tooth present in each quadrant. 8.27.2.2.3.  Anterior  Extension  RPD. The first prem olars and second m olars are clasped bilaterally. 8.27.2.2.4. Combination Extension RPD. With the canine tooth as the anterior limit, locate one clasp assembly as far anteriorly and anothe r as far posteriorly as possible on each side. Obviously, only one clasp assembly can be used in a quadrant if just one tooth remains. 8.28.  Identify  Surfaces  To  Use  as  Guide  Planes.  Generally, all tooth surfaces next to edentulous spaces and in areas where reciprocal elem ents of  the RPD will be placed should be used for guide planes. This m ay include proxim al areas, distal surf aces of distal abutm ents, and lingual surfaces. The exception is anterior teeth, because esthetics will usua lly not allow the change in contour. Guide planes are generally broad occlusogingivally and flat buccolingually, removing much of the gingival undercut. 8.29. Choose a Path of Insertion To Confirm an Occlusal Plane Tilt: 8.29.1.  Tentative  Design. W hen receiving a diagnostic cast,  examine it for a possible path of insertion that m inimizes undesirable undercuts, gives desirable undercuts where needed, and makes maximum use of guide planes. Then decide  on a tentative design before beginning to draw a design on the cast. Next place the cast on an adjustable tilt table to determ ine if the design is possible. If that is not possible, a change to the tentative design may be needed. 8.29.2. Path of Insertion:  8.29.2.1. The path of insertion (or path of placem ent) is the direction of travel an RPD takes from the instant its rigid parts contact abutm ent teeth to the tim e all rests are f ully seated. All RPD components effect the path of insertion, but guide planes have the most influence.  8.29.2.2. Different RPDs, each with a different rout e for going to place, can probably be used for the sam e case. The RPDs m ight not even  look alike. RPD design depends in part on the depth and location of tooth and soft tissue undercuts, both of which change as the proposed path of insertion changes. Because som e RPD  designs are better for certain situations than others, it follows that there is a path of placement that is better suited to a case than others.  8.29.3. Definition of Tilt:  8.29.3.1. When a cast is m ounted on an adjustable tilt  table in a surveyor, tilt is defined as the orientation of the cast’s occlusal plane to the long axis of the surveyor’s spindle. The angle that the spindle makes with the occlusal plane is a  representation of one possible path of insertion. By tilting the survey table at various anglesreasonable paths of insertion and can be evaluated and the best path can be chosen.  8.29.3.2. Undercut can be shifted from  one area to another by tilting the cast. The cast is tilted to increase undercut in desirable areas and d ecrease undercut in undesirable areas, but the sum  total undercut of all the structures of the dental arch cannot be increased or decreased by tilting the cast, only rearranged. The tilt of an occlusal  plane is a com bination of  its lateral and anteroposterior orientations to the spindle.  , the tooth and soft tissue undercuts along all AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  405 8.29.3.3. Five basic tilts are shown in Figure 8.46.  Look at the cast on the tilt table from  the posterior aspect. (This point of  reference holds true for either a maxillary or mandibular casts.) The positions (or tilts) are (A) horizontal (f lat or neutral), (B) right lateral, (C) lef t lateral, (D) anterior, and (E) posterior. There are an infinite  number of orientations possible between these basic tilts. One path of insertion (occlusal plane tilt) must be chosen as best.  8.29.4. Conditions for an Acceptable Tilt: 8.29.4.1. The more a tilt meets the following three conditions, the more acceptable it becomes:  8.29.4.1.1. Guide planes should be identified and be  made parallel to the path of insertion. The existence of natural guide planes at a tilt  where desirable undercuts exist is a m atter of chance. The dentist approaches this problem by first picking a tilt for the most advantageous location of tooth undercuts. He or she goes back to the patient’s mouth and creates opposing of insertion. The cuts are m ade on abutm ent flat surfaces that parallel the proposed path teeth in areas that will contact bracing or reciprocal com ponents. The dentist m akes new impressions and performs another survey. Guid e planes should now exist along the path of insertion where tooth undercuts are advantageously located.   Figure 8.46. Basic Occlusal Plane Tilts.   406  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 8.29.4.1.2. Desirable undercuts can be found on tabutments.  8.29.4.1.3.

Gross tissue or tooth undercuts that cause the superior  or inferior border of the m ajor connector or plating to stand away from tooth or tissue will create food traps.  eeth already identified as potential 8.29.5.  Locating  an  Acceptable  Tilt.  Of the three conditions for tilt acceptability (paragraph 8.29.4), the dom inant criterion is  finding  guide  planes  on  teeth  already  identified  as  potential abutments. Because locating an acceptable table tilt (path of insertion) is best perform ed in an organized manner, following is a suggested series of steps for accomplishing that purpose: 8.29.5.1. Set the cast to a horizontal tilt; that is, set the occlusal plane parallel to the horizon. Except for a few specialized designs, such as rotational path RPDs, virtually all paths of insertion will be very close to this tilt. The rem aining adjustments will be slight adjustments to this basic tilt to optimize the placement of the undercut. The analyzing rod placed in the spindle of the surveyor indicates the path of inserparallel to the proposed path of insertion. 8.29.5.2. Set the lateral com ponent of tilt (Figur e 8.47). The guideline for determ ining the lateral tilt is com mon to alm ost all cases, rega rdless of classification. Align as m any of the lingual guide planes with the path of insertion as possible. Distribute available undercut equally between the midfacial infrabulge zones on bilate rally opposing abutment teeth. It is necessary to adjust the tilt to balance am ong the three cond itions: guide planes parallel to the path of insertion, adequate retentive undercuts and minimal undesirable undercuts. tion. Any surface parallel to the analyzing rod is  Figure 8.47. Set the Lateral Component of Tilt.  8.29.5.3. Determine the anteroposterior component of tilt. The infrabulge area of a tooth can be divided into the following zones of undercut: m esiofacial, midfacial, distofacial, mesiolingual, midlingual, and distolingual.  8.29.5.3.1. The facial zones are most frequently used for developing retention in RPD cases. Consider the exam ple of a posterior bilatera l toothborne case. Such a case usually has two abutment teeth on each side of the dental arc h. With three facial zones per abutm ent, there AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  407 are nine com binations of facial zones possi ble in one quadrant alone. For exam ple, the mesiofacial zone or an anterior abutment might be used together with the distofacial zone on the posterior abutm ent. In another exam ple, the m idfacial zones m ight be used on both abutments in the quadrants. The possibilities in crease substantially when both sides of  the arch are being considered.  8.29.5.3.2. After the lateral com ponent of tilt has been set, the next task is to find the anteroposterior occlusal plane orientation th at provides the best com bination of zones on abutments suited to the classification of the case (paragraph 8.29.4). 8.29.5.4. Evaluate a zone of undercut or comfollows: bination of zones (undercut desirability) as is deep enough (0.010 inch for a chrom e 8.29.5.4.1. Check to see if undercuts are present on the abutments suited to the classification of the case. Rem ember, an interm ediate abutment is clasped for bracing and encirclem ent purposes only; the tooth’s undercuts are not ordinarily engaged. An intermediate abutment is a single natural tooth isolated between two ed entulous spaces in a quadrant; other natural teeth remain mesial to the anterior space and distal to the posterior space. 8.29.5.4.2. Make sure the zones of undercut are reasonably accessible. If the retentive tip of a clasp cannot get to them, do not use the zone. 8.29.5.4.3. Make sure the undercut in the zone clasp). Ideally, the distance between the height of contour and depth of retentive undercut should be between 1.5 m m and 2.5 m m when 0.010 in ch retentive undercut is used. This distance will be less for 0.005 and more for 0.020 inch retention. When the tooth shape does not allow this, consider changing the path ofmodifying the tooth).  8.29.5.4.4. Ensure the undercuts are located in zones where the flexing action of the clasps do not cause harm . For exam ple, using m idfacial or distofacial undercuts on a distal abutment in a distal extension situation is almost mandatory. The same can be said for using midfacial or m esiofacial undercuts on m esially located abutm ents in anterior extension cases. 8.29.5.4.5. Avoid the display of m etal on anterior  abutments. To do this, choose zones of undercut that can be engaged by the less noticeab le clasp types (sim ple circumferential and I-bar clasps). 8.29.5.4.6. As shown in Figure 8.48, when the reten tive arms of two clasps in a quadrant converge (A) or diverge (B), the overall retentiv e effect is som ewhat better than having the arms run in the same direction (C).  insertion (or ask the dentist to consider 8.29.5.5.

Depending on the classification of the case, desirable underc uts are m ost likely found within a predictable range of anteroposterior tilt. W ith the lateral  tilt of the case already determ ined, a zero degree (or horizontal anteroposterior orientation) is the place to start. 8.29.5.5.1. Unilateral and Bilateral Posterior Toothborne RPD. Set the tilt from zero to a few degrees either side of zero. 408  Figure 8.48. Use Zones of Undercut That Enable Clasp Arms To Converge or Diverge.

Whether an acceptable framework design can be composed to conform to this path remains to be decided. Notice how all the zones of undercut have changed in size and shape.

If reevaluation of the case shows the mesiofacial zones are not deep enough, try to find another suitable com bination of undercuts with the required depth.

The space at the m esial of the lateral incisor is too large and represents a potential food trap. The size of the space in the patient’s mouth might be obvious to the casual observer. The more exaggerated versions 420  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 of this problem  can seriously lim it the ability  to produce artificial teeth that are properly shaped. 8.30.2.3.2. In Figure 8.71, the proximal spaces distal to the dotted lines are roughly equal. If desirable undercuts are available for use, this  tilt is m ore acceptable than the one in Figure 8.70. A tilt having adequate undercuts in the right  places can be an elusive thing because it does not take m uch of a change to ruin its  distinctive features. When undesirable undercuts are extremely deep, slight tilt modifications of the kind described do not help much. Ask the dentist to resolve the problem in some other way.  Figure 8.71. Increased Potential for an Esthetic, Hygienic Adaptation of an Artificial Tooth.  8.31. Place Tripod Marks on the Cast. Tripoding is a m ethod of m arking a surveyed cast with three dots so the cast or its duplicate can be repositioned on any survey table at exactly the sam e tilt. This capability is essential when transferring a design from  a diagnostic to a m aster cast and for subsequent blockout procedures. 8.31.1.  Place  Tripod  Marks  as  Part  of  the  Initial  Survey  (Figure 8.72). After finding an acceptable tilt, lock the surveying table in that  position. Insert a carbon m arker into the surveyor spindle. Bring the tip of the carbon into contact with a feature on the cast, lock the vertical spindle, and mark the surface with a short horizontal lin e by m oving the surveying table on the surveyor base. After the first m ark is made, make a mark on two other cast features at the identical spindle height used to place the first dot by sliding the surveying table to bring the carbon m arker in contact with two additional areas on the cast.

Mark the Tooth and Soft Tissue Survey Lines With a Carbon Marker: 8.32.1. After choosing a path of insertion and tripoding th e cast, the next st ep is to m ake a “contour map” of the height of contour of tooth and tissue structures (Figure 8.73). Place a carbon marker in the vertical sp indle of the surveyor . Move the cast and carbon  marker, one against the other, by sliding the table around on the base of the surveyor.   422  Figure 8.73. Mark Heights of Contour With a Carbon Marker. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  8.32.2. To properly survey a cast, firs t trace survey lines at the heights of contour of the teeth by placing the side of the carbon m arker against the height of contour  of the tooth and the tip of the marker against the bottom of the undercut. Outline the entire undercut area.  8.32.3. Next, sim ultaneously m ark the soft tissue he ights of  contour with the side of a carbon marker and the lower limit of the undercut with the tip of the marker.  8.32.4. Survey lines have value for determs, m inor connectors, and m ajor connectors  in the overall design; choosing su itable substitutes for missing teeth and soft tissue; and bloc king out undesirable undercuts before  duplicating the m aster cast in refractory material. Survey lines also are a guide to the dentist to show w here tooth contours must be altered to eliminate or reduce undesirable undercuts or to establish guide plane prior to the final impression.  ining the proper location of clasp arm8.33. Decide Where Tooth Modifications Will Enhance RPD Function. Four components of the RPD usually require modification of tooth surfaces by the dentist prior to making the final impression. These components should be marked in red on the diagnostic cast. 8.33.1. Rests. Rest seats almost always require preparation. Embrasure clasp assemblies with their associated rests often require significant tooth reduction.  8.33.2. Guide Planes. Guide planes should be as  long and flat as possibl e. When the guide plane is next to an extension base, it is also kept flat in a buccolingual plane.  8.33.3. Clasps. Normally, the height of contour of the t ooth is high at the line angle of the tooth where the shoulder of the clasp co ntacts the tooth. In or der for a suprabulge clasp to drop down toward the gingival of the tooth  without crossing the undercut, the  dentist must reshape the toot h to lower the survey line. Abnormally high survey lines are most pronounced on mandibular molars that are the distal abutm ent in  a tooth-borne RP D. These areas m ust be adjusted for proper clasp placement, especially on the mesiolingual.  8.33.4.  Plating. Som etimes tooth undercuts   will interfere  with plating. This  is particu larly prevalent with crowded or rotated lower anterior teeth. These undercuts should be removed by the dentist, if possible. 8.34. Mark the Location of Retentive Tips. Now that the cast has been tripoded and surveyed and adesign decided upon, locate the depth of desired undercut using a suitable undercut gauge. Mark the proper depth of undercut with a discreet red dot. This  dot is the definitive location of the lower edge of the retentive clasp tip.  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  8.35.  Select  a  Clasp  Assembly  for  Each  Abutment  Tooth. Paragraphs 8.29.4 and 8.29.5 deal with finding an acceptab le tilt and m ake suggestions for z ones of undercut in  specific co mbinations for the different cas e clas sifications. The problem  is to select  clas p shapes th at are bes t able to  get to thos e zones. The ability of a clasp to eng age an undercut  located in a particu lar spot on a tooth’s su rface is limited by occlusion, esthetic considerations, presence of soft tissue undercuts, classification of the case, location of the undercut, incidence of decay associated with the clasp form, and perio dontal integrity of abutment teeth as follows: 423 8.35.1. Factors Influencing Choice of a Clasp Assembly: 8.35.1.1. Occlusion: 8.35.1.1.1. Circumferential Clasp Assemblies: 8.35.1.1.1.1. W hen upper and lower teeth are circumferential clasp requires a passage space 1.25 mm wide  and 1  mm high through an embrasure area. Embrasure clasps need a channel 2 mm wide and 1 mm high. If the space does not exist naturally, it is up to the dentis t to adequately open up embrasure channels to accommodate clasp parts (body and arm s). An 18-gauge round wire is about 1 mm in diameter. Dentists sometimes use one or two  of these wires to test if enough room  exist (Figure 8.74).  in centric occlusion, a simple  Figure 8.74. Embrasure Clasp Clearance.  8.35.1.1.1.2. Another important consideration is th at a high survey line on an abutm ent opposing tooth so closely that there is no tooth can approach the shearing cusp of an room for a clasp arm . When centric occlus ion is very “tight” (opposing teeth contact solidly and cusps overlap steeply), start thinking about infrabulge alternatives to circumferential clasping. 8.35.1.1.2. Bar Clasp Assemblies. A bar clasp cannot be used in posterior segm ents where  the approach a rm no teeth are m issing. The design f eatures of a  bar clasp require thatoriginate from  a denture base area. In areas  where edentulous spaces exist, a bar clasp  interferes w ith occlus ion less than  circum ferential clasps  because  a bar clasp d oes not penetrate through embrasures completely. 8.35.1.2. Esthetic Considerations: 8.35.1.2.1. Circumferential Clasp. A circumferential clasp is less visible on teeth with low 424  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 survey lines. If the retentive arm  is made to  approach a mesiofacial undercut from the distal aspect of an abutm ent tooth and the clasp arm  travels as c lose to the gingival margin as the survey line permits, the metal does not show as much. 8.35.1.2.2. Bar Clasp. A bar clasp’s approach arm crosses gingival surfaces on the way to a zone of undercut. To the extent that most people do not expose gum tissue when they talk or smile, I-bar clasps can be less conspicuous than many circumferential types. 8.35.1.3. Presence of Soft Tissue Undercuts. This consid eration affects the  use of  bar clasp s as follows: 8.35.1.3.1. The approach arm of a bar clasp should  contact tissue between its point of origin and place where th e arm crosses the gingiv al margin. The presence of an undesirable soft tissue  undercut  in  the  path  of  a  bar  clasp’s  approach  arm  is  one  of  the  most  serious contraindications to its use. Figure 8.75 shows a high, deep, soft tissue undercut.   Figure 8.75. Soft Tissue Undercut.  8.35.1.3.2. Given the condition  illustrated in F igure 8.75, the only  option for positioning a bar clasp’s approach arm is shown in Figure  8.76. This option is unacceptable. Given the  conditions shown in Figure 8.77, a proper relationship can be developed betw een an approach arm and underlying tissue (Figure 8.78).  8.35.1.3.3. There are instances where a tooth leans outsurface blocks satisfacto ry placem ent of an a pproach arm . The problem m ost frequently occurs in the canine area (Figure 8.79).  so far into the vestibule the facial 8.35.1.4. Classification of the Case:  8.35.1.4.1. Extension cases require special attention.  Clasp assemblies that use a m esial rest in conjunction with a distal undercut for distal extension case ab utments produce fewe r tilting forces on the teeth.  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 8.76. Incorrect Approach Arm Relationship. 425  Figure 8.77. No Soft Tissue Undercut.  Figure 8.78. Acceptable Approach Arm Relationship.  426  Figure 8.79. Bar Clasp Use Is Blocked. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  8.35.1.4.2. The same is true when using a distal rest  together with a mesial zone of undercut for anterior extension situations. Extension RPDs must be thought of in a different way than toothborne RPDs because part of th e support of the RPD com es from compressible tissues. As a result, the RPD moves m uch more when the patien t chews. The clasp assemblies must be chosen to consider this movement. There are three primary concepts for dealing with this movement; stress-breaking, stress-releasing, and stress-distribution. 8.35.1.5.  Location  of  the  Undercut. Most fo rms of circum ferential and bar clasps are best suited to engaging undercuts in  mesial or distal zones. The I-bar is an exception. It is specifically designed to engage midfacial or midlingual undercuts. 8.35.1.6. Incidence of Decay Associated With a Clasp Form. There are dental p atients who are unusually prone to developi ng cavities. Because bar clasps  generally contact less tooth surface than circumferential clasps, the chances for decay should be somewhat reduced. 8.35.1.7. Periodontal Integrity of Abutment Teeth: 8.35.1.7.1. Circumferential Clasps. Circumferential clasps are stiffer than bar varieties and have more potential to do dam age while the  RPD is being inserted or removed. Clasp arm s placed close to the occlu sal surface of a tooth be cause of high survey lines act to widen the chewing table. This increases the load an abutment must bear. The additional burden could be too much for the tooth’s supporting structures to tolerate. 8.35.1.7.2.  Combination  Clasps. T here is an authoritative body of opinion that believes combination clasps are less abus ive to teeth th an cast clasps because the wire reten tive arm of a combination clasp has a round cross-section  and can flex in many planes instead of just one. 8.35.2. Common Clasp Assembly Applications. Observe how the common clasp form s relate to survey lines and zones of undercut in the follo wing examples. Although it  is impossible to show every conceivable situation, these limited number of examples are supposed to represent principles that can be applied to a much larger range of possibilities: 8.35.2.1. Circumferential Clasp Assemblies: 8.35.2.1.1. Simple Circumferential:  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  427 8.35.2.1.1.1. Two arm s project from the clasp’s  body and term inate on the sides of the tooth opposite from the clasp assembly’s rest. A simple circumferential clasp is versatile, easily adjusted, and can be relatively  inconspicuous. Limiting factors perm itting, this is  the circumferential clasp of choice.  8.35.2.1.1.2. The undercuts used are the m esial or  distal zones on facial or lingual surfaces. Exam ple #1 s hows a toothborne quadrant and th e clasp arm s are convergent (Figure 8.80). Example #2 shows a t oothborne quadrant and the clasp arms are divergent (Figure 8.81). Example #3 shows a distal extension quadrant, distal abutment, mesial rest, and distofacial zone (Figure 8.82). Example #4 shows an anterior extension case, anterior abutment, distal rest, and mesiofacial zone (Figure 8.83).  Figure  8.80.  Simple  Circumferential  Clasp  Assemblies  With  Convergent  Retentive  Arms (Example #1).  Figure 8.81. Simple Circumferential Clasp Assemblies With Divergent Retentive Arms (Example #2).  8.35.2.1.2. Embrasure (Crib). This clasp asse mbly consists of two circumf erential clasps joined at th eir bod ies, and  a single m inor connector. The assem bly passes betw een two adjacent natural teeth. One retentive arm engages the mesial zone of undercut on the anterior abutment, and the other retentive arm  uses  a distal undercut on the posterior abutm ent (Figure 8.84). 428  Figure  8.82.

It logically follows that a properly braced ring clasp is contraindicated when there is an undesirable soft ti ssue undercut in the path of th e strut. Mesial zone undercuts on molars can be difficult to  get to. Braced ring clasps are a design com promise that can fulfill that purpose. The undercuts most fr equently inv olved are m esiolingual on mandibular molars and mesiofacial on maxillary molar teeth. Example #1 shows the ring clasp used to enter a m esiolingual zone on a mandibular molar; Figure 8.85 represents a lingual and buccal v iew. Example #2 shows the  ring clasp used to enter a m esiofacial zone on a maxillary molar; Figure 8.86 represents a buccal and a lingual view.  Figure 8.85. Ring Clasp Assembly, Mandibular Arch (Example #1).  Figure 8.86. Ring Clasp Assembly, Maxillary Arch (Example #2).  8.35.2.1.4. Reverse Action (Hairpin):  8.35.2.1.4.1. The distinctive feature of this circumfe rential clasp is that the retentive arm reverses itself on the face of the tooth (Figur e 8.87). The retentive tip of a hairpin clasp enters a zone of undercut immediately gingival to the retentive arm’s shoulder.  8.35.2.1.4.2. One problem associated with hairpin clasps is that they cover a great deal of  tooth surface. They are highly v isible and can not be used on teeth having short clinical crowns.  430  Figure 8.87. Hairpin Clasp Assemblies. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  8.35.2.1.4.3. Perhaps the m ost serious shortcom ing of the hairpin clasp is its susceptibility to breakage. It is very difficult  for the dental laboratory technician to shape and polish this retentive arm  without destroying its taper. As  a result, this  clasp usually flexes at the weakest point (th e angle of th e hairpin) and fractures. However, it m ay be used to enter distofacial unde rcuts on canines, distofacial u ndercuts on prem olars, and mesiofacial infrabulge zones of m olars when soft tissue undercuts prevent the use of bar approach arms. 8.35.2.1.5. Half-and-Half (Split). This clasp assem bly consists of m esial and distal m inor connectors, each of which bears a rest and an arm. The split clasp can engage most mesial or distal zone undercuts o n the  buccal or lingual.  Figure 8.8 8  represents buccal and  lingual views of a split clasp used in this manner.  Figure 8.88. Half-and-Half (Split) Clasp Assembly.   8.35.2.1.6.  Multiple  Circumferential. This clasp assem bly c onsists of two opposing circumferential clasps jo ined at the term inal end of the two reciprocal arm s. A separate minor connector attach es each of the joined cl asps to the fram ework. The recip rocal arms are united to provide increased support for two or  three weak or isolated teeth. Buccal and lingual views of the multiple circumferential clasp assembly are presented in Figure 8.89. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 8.89. Multiple Circumferential Clasp Assembly. 431   8.35.2.1.7. Combination Circumferential: 8.35.2.1.7.1. The com bination clasp consists of a  wrought wire retentive arm  and a cast reciprocal arm. The wr ought  wire arm may be em bedded in the fram ework during the waxing and casting procedures, the wire m ay be solde red to the f ramework af ter the  framework is cast, or the wire m ay be embedded in the acrylic resin denture base during processing.  8.35.2.1.7.2. Some authorities m aintain that a wr ought wire arm  is detrim entally altered by high temperature. Therefore it is  advis able to so lder th e wrou ght wir e to  the  framework at a point well away from the flexible retentive end of the wire.  8.35.2.1.7.3. The com bination clasp is believed to  exert less destructive force on an abutment because of its high flexib ility. By the same token, a wrought wire arm  is easily bent out of shape.  8.35.2.1.7.4. The m ost common uses of the combin ation clasp are on an abutm ent tooth adjacent to  a distal extension b the mesiofacial zone (F igure 8.90) and on periodon tally weak abutm ents. The com bination clasp may also be used to engage a m idfacial undercut with the m id-body portion of the clasp. In this case, both the shoulder and tip  of the clasp would be  above the survey line. The depth of undercut required is usually  .010 or .015 and rarely .020 inch.

A special variety of wrought wire clasps is the twin flex. It is used in interproximal retentive undercuts,  usually in the anterior wher e there is a desire to avoid display of m etal. The clasp extends underneath  the m ajor connector, wh ere it is soldered, into the proximal undercut (Figure 8.91). It requires significant vertical space and is difficult to construct.  432  Figure 8.90. Buccal View of Combination Circumferential Clasp Assembly. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 8.91. Lingual View of Twin Flex Clasp Beneath Lingual Major Connector.  8.35.2.2. Bar Clasp Assemblies: 8.35.2.2.1.  T-Bar  Clasp. This clasp ordinarily uses underc uts located in facial or lingual zones adjacent to an edentulous space. If su ch a clasp had a long approach arm and was cast in chrom e, it should engage .015 inch undercut.  When the retentive tip of a  T-bar clasp engages a distofacial undercut, the bracing tip f alls on the  t ooth’s highly visible m esial surface. However, this com ponent provides a v aluable bracing function . The T-bar clasp is not indicated on canines and firs t premolars. Two examples of T-bar clasp assembly use are in Figures 8.92 and 8.93. 8.35.2.2.2. Modified T-Bar. When esthetics is most important, the bracing tip of a T-ba r clasp can be omitted. When the bracing tip off a T-bar clasp is om itted, the result is called a modified T or 1/2 T. Because the modified T is som ewhat more esthetic than a T -bar clasp, the modified T may be used on anteriorly posi tioned abutments. Two examples of modified T bar clasp assemblies are shown in Figures 8.94 and 8.95.    AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 8.92. T-Bar Clasp Assemblies—Toothborne Quadrant. 433  Figure 8.93.

Stress-Releasing Clasp Assembly Applications. The stress-releasing concept is very popular with som e dentists. It uses various specialized clasp assem blies in an attem pt to minimize torquing forces on the term inal abutments of di stal extension RPDs. These include the I-bar, RPI, m odified T-bar, and RPA concep ts. While each of these techniques h as its own peculiarities, they all have in  common a m esial rest on th e terminal abutment and distal guide plane, and they use a m idbuccal, m esial-midbuccal, or distobuccal retentive undercut. The major connector on the lingual is kept at least 5 mm below the gingival margin. 8.35.2.3.1. I-Bar Clasp. This technique, originally described by Dr. Kratochvil, uses a long flat guide plane on the distal of the abutm ent that contacts the toot h from 1 to 2mm on the  tissue up to the occlusal surface.  There is no  relief under this m etal except for b lockout in undercut areas. The guide plane m ay wrap sli ghtly around the distolingual line angle. A distal rest accompanies the mesial rest on the  next anterior tooth. The I-bar clasp engages a midbuccal undercut. 8.35.2.3.2. RPI Clasp. Developed by Dr. Krol, RPI stands for rest, proximal plate, and I-Bar (Figure 8.97). 435 AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005   Figure 8.97.

A minor connector is attached to this rest in the m esiolingual embrasure. The minor connector is constructed to avoid touching the distolingual surface of the adjacent tooth. 8.35.2.3.2.2. Proximal Plate. The superior edge of the pr oximal plate engages abo ut 1 mm of the bottom  of the distal guide plane.  The lingual m argin of the plate follows the  curvature of the abutment far enough so the  remaining distance to the minor connector is  less than the width of the tooth.

The tissue under this step is relieved with one thickness of 30-gauge wax. 8.35.2.3.2.3. I-Bar. The reten tive tip of an I-bar has  a 2 mm span of c ontact with tooth surface, and the bottom of this contact is located at .010 inch undercut. The approach arm of the I-bar should be located at least 3 mm away from the gingival margin. 8.35.2.3.2.4.  Guide  Planes. Before a final impression is  made, the dentis t prepa res a  guide plane at the o cclusal 1/3 of the abutment’s distal surface. The distal guide plane is about 2 to 3 mm in height.

In mandibular posterior toothborne RPDs that use a lingual  bar major connector, the anterior part of the bar should be supported with auxiliary rests in the m esial fossa of the first prem olar teeth. tion where auxiliary rests are an excellent 8.37. Draw the Design in Appropriate Coded Colors. (NOTE: This is the las t step in the sur vey and design procedure.) The choices am ong RPD components have been made  as the survey procedure has progressed. All that rem ains is to draw an accurate  representation of the RPD on the cast. Per Figure 8.98, the prim ary guides for the drawing are the survey  lines, points of undercut m arked in red pencil, vertical overlap line drawn on the lingual surfaces of the upper anterior teeth, and anatomical features of the cast as follows:  Figure 8.98. Surveyed and Designed Casts.  8.37.1. RPD Design Color Code. Standard colors are reserved fo r drawing particular parts of an RPD design on a cast. These colors help to deli neate components clearly and i mprove the quality of communication between the dentist and the technician as follows: AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  8.37.1.1. Red: 437 8.37.1.1.1. Diagnostic Casts. The color  red is used to indicate areas in  the patient’s mouth that require preparation or reco ntouring such as rest s eats, interfering cusps in the o pposing arch, and guide planes. Red is used to m ark the point where the retentiv e tip of a clasp will be positioned. Tissue relief is also marked in red. 8.37.1.1.2. Master Casts. The use of the color  red on a master c ast is limited to m arking points of undercut for positioning clasp retentive tips, and tissue relief areas. 8.37.1.2.  Blue. The color  blue  is used to outline the excoverage. 8.37.1.3. Brown. The color brown is reserved for outlining metal parts of the RPD. 8.37.1.4.  Black. Tooth and soft tissue survey lines arblack.

The suggested order for the steps in drawing the design on a diagnostic cast are: 8.37.2.1. Rests. The rest seats are colored. 8.37.2.2. Clasps. No matter what kind of clasp is drawn, than 180 degrees of the tooth’s circumference. the full assembly m ust take in m ore 8.37.2.2.1. Circumferential Clasp: 8.37.2.2.1.1.  Retentive  Arm. The shoulder (proxim al one-thi rd) of a retentive arm  is  located above the survey line. The retentive  tip (terminal one-third) ends on the undercut previously marked in red. 8.37.2.2.1.2. Reciprocal Arm. The gingival edge of the reci procal arm conforms to the survey line. If the survey line appro aches the occlusal surface of a posterior abutm ent or the clinical crown is very short, consider us ing reciprocal plating.  The occlusal edge of reciprocal plating terminates about 0.5 mm occlusal to the survey line. 8.37.2.2.2. T-Bar and Modified T-Bar Clasps: 8.37.2.2.2.1. Approach Arm. As the approach arm  leaves the denture b ase, the gingival edge of the arm is located at leas t 3 mm from the abutment’s gingival crest. The edge of the arm nearest the sulcus m ust not dip below  any soft tissu e survey lines that m ight be present. The arm must not interfere with normal sulcus mobility. When the approach arm curves to make contact with the tooth surface, it is drawn so it intersects the gingival crest line at 90 degrees. The approach arm s of T- bar and m odified T-bar clasps m ake first contact with the tooth at the survey line. 8.37.2.2.2.2. Bracing Tip. (T-bar clasps only) The gingival edge of an approach arm ’s bracing tip falls on, or very close to, the survey line. 8.37.2.2.2.3. Retentive Tip. The retentive tip extends from the approach arm ’s contact with the survey line to the point of undercut  on the tooth’s surface  previously marked in red. 8.37.2.2.2.4.  Reciprocal  Arm.

I-Bar Clasps That Use Reciprocal Arms: 438  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 8.37.2.2.3.1. Approach Arm. The considerations for an I-bar approach arm ’s soft tissue relationship are the same as the T-bar and modified T-bar clasps (paragraph 8.37.2.2.2.1). 8.37.2.2.3.2. Retentive Tip. The I-bar’s r etentive tip is th e end of its approach arm . The tip m akes first contact with the tooth at the .010 inch undercut mark and extends occlusally or incisally for 2 mm. 8.37.2.2.3.3. Reciprocal Arm. The considerations are the same as for the circumferential clasp reciprocal arms (paragraph 8.37.2.2.1.2). 8.37.2.2.4. RPI Bar Clasp Assemblies (Figure 8.97): 8.37.2.2.4.1. Approach Arm and Retentive Tip. The considerations are the sam e as for I-bar clasps that use conventional reciprocal arms (paragraph 8.37.2.2.3). 8.37.2.2.4.2. Minor Connector. The m inor connector is dr awn so it does not touch an adjacent tooth. 8.37.2.2.4.3. Distal Plate. The plate is supposed to cont act the cervical 1 mm of the pre-prepared distal surface guidi ng plane. In clasps that engage m idfacial undercuts, the assembly plating starts at the abutment’s distofacial co rner.  It extends around the distolingual corner eno ugh so th e resu ltant space between the plate and the mconnector is less than the width of the tooth (encirclement). inor 8.37.2.3. Major Connectors: 8.37.2.3.1. Defining the Borders of Major and Minor Connectors: 8.37.2.3.1.1. Avoid adding to the prom inence of na tural convexities  by covering their crests with metal. 8.37.2.3.1.2. Cover gingival m argin tissue com pletely by an adequately relieved part of the RPD, or position the component at least 4 to 6 mm from the gingiva. 8.37.2.3.1.3. Cross gingival crest tissue at right angles to the gingival margin. 8.37.2.3.2. Maxillary Major Connectors: 8.37.2.3.2.1. Anterior Borders of Straps. Anterior borders of  straps should follow the valleys between rugae as much as possible. When crossing over rugae, do it at 90 degrees to their crests. Stay 6 mm f rom gingival margins where possible. W hen utilizing lingual plating, be aware of where the line of impact between upper and lower incisors is drawn; do not extend lingual plati ng incisal to that line. The lead ing edge of a li ngual plate is scalloped. The plate covers the lingual gingi val one-third of the tooth in the cingulum area and ris es to cover interproxim al spaces  up to th e co ntact poin ts. An exception is made when large diastemas are present. Cingulums are covered, but interproximal spaces are not. Make sure a rest supports each end of the plate. 8.37.2.3.2.2. Lateral Borders of a Maxillary Major Connector. Either plate the lingual surface of a tooth or stay 6 mm from the gingival border. 8.37.2.3.2.3.  Posterior  Border  of  a  Maxillary  Major  Connector. A strap should traverse the palatal vau lt anterior to the vib rating line. Fu ll palatal cov erage ends on the vibrating line in a manner similar to complete dentures. 8.37.2.3.2.4. Width of Straps. Maxillary strap major connectors should be made as wide as the combined width of the maxillary second premolar and first molar. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  439 8.37.2.3.2.5.  Placement  of  Straps  and  Horseshoes  Relative  to  the  Palatal  Vault (Figure 8.99). The hard palate m akes an ascent from the incisive papilla to the height of the vault. Then it pro ceeds more or less str aight back to the vibrating line. Try to d raw a strap or a h orseshoe so at leas t part of th e major connector straddles the place where the  palatal angle changes. A strap gets additional strength from the “angle iron” effect.

The superior edge of a mandibular lingual bar should clear the crests of the gingiva by 4 mm . The inferior edg e should be placed hig h enough th at it does not interfere with the norm al mobility of the floor of the mouth. In distal extension cases, lingual bars end clean ly on a vertical lin e with the d istal surface of the terminal abutment. 8.37.2.3.3.2. Lingual Plates. Mandibular lingual plates are  outlined in the sam e manner as their maxillary counterparts (paragraph 8.37.2.3.2.1). 8.37.2.4. Minor Connectors: 8.37.2.4.1.

Retention grids should always extend over the c rest of  the r idge to pr event m idline fractures of the denture base. G rids are constructed to avoid the retromolar pads in the mandibular arch. Adequate bulk and strength in the metal at the junction of the grid and the major connector is essential as follows: 8.37.2.4.2.1. Mesh.

Finish Lines. Finish lines show where there will be a 90-deg ree butt jo int between acrylic resin and metal. When the tissue surface of the denture base will be made of resin, there will be an interna l and external finish line. With metal bases, there will on ly be an external finish line. Internal and external finish retentive grid could be s eriously weakened. Normally, the external finish line is p laced toward the center of the arch from the internal finish line.  8.37.2.6.1. Internal finish lines should be placed about 1 to 2 mm  fr om the survey line adjacent to the proxim al areas of the edentulou s areas. This creates an  area of metal next to the gingival margin. Only mesh and ladder-type retention have internal finish lines. 8.37.2.6.2. External finish lines should be draw n, keeping in m ind where the denture teeth will be p laced. The m etal and  res in should  provide a sm ooth transition from  the m ajor connector to the denture teeth and should create a natural contour. 8.37.2.6.3.

To prepare the formula for a paint-on cast sealant, prepare a concentrated solution consisting of  50 gm of cellulose ac etate, 12.5 cc of diethylphthalate, and 1 pint of acetone. Mix the ingredients and let the solution set for 24 hours. Then dilute l part of the concentrate to 10 parts of the acetone. Paint this onto a de signed cast to protect the lines again st smudging.

Pouring a final impression to m ake a  master cast is one of th e most crucial steps in RP D fabrication. The cast has to be as accurate, dense, and strong as possible. To obtain these qualities, pour an alginate im pression within 10 m inutes of removing it from the patient’s mouth. This also means pouring a rubber base impression within the first hour.  8.39.2. For maximum density and strength, use a vacuum  spatulated mix of artificial stone to pour final im pressions. Use the two-step m ethod me ntioned in Chapter 7, paragraph 7.25, to pour impressions for RPD c onstruction, or box them  w ith a 50:50 m ix of plaster and pum ice before pouring th em according to Chapter 7, paragraphs 7.34 an d 7.35.

After he or she receives saqualified technician redraws the survey and design on the master cast.  8.41.2. First, the tripod m arks fou nd on the diagnostic cast are transferred to the m aster cast (paragraph 8.31.2). (The tripod m arks allow the m aster cast to be  oriented in the sam e position within the surveyor the diagnostic cast occupied during its survey.)  8.41.3. W hen the original tilt of the diagnostic cast has been duplicate d, the m aster cast i s surveyed. Then the color coded design is transfe rred from the diagnostic cast to the m aster cast (Figure 8.98).  NOTE:  The only difference in the code for a m aster cast is that  rest s eats are outlined in brown rather than being fully colored in red.  Section 8E—Refractory Cast Production, Design Transfer to the Refractory Cast, and Framework Wax-Up 8.42.  Producing  a  Refractory  Cast. A  refractory  cast  is a heat-resistant dup licate of a modified (blocked out and relieved) m aster cast. The refractory  cast is m ade from dental  casting investm ent. It serves as a base for form ing the RPD fram ework in wax and plastic. Subseque ntly, the refractory cast and attached framework pattern become part of a mold used for casting the framework in metal. The two major steps in producing a refractory cast are: 8.42.1. Preparing the Master Cast. Adjustments to the tongue sp ace and base should be done  before the master cast is placed on a survey table and tripoded. 8.42.1.1. Maxillary Arch Major Connectors. Maxillary arch m ajor connectors should have a prepared seal (beadline) along th e portions of the com ponent that border on soft tissue (Figure htly and prevents food im paction under the 8.102). The beadline displaces soft tissue sligconnector. Create the beadline by scraping a rounded groove, 1 mm wide and 0.5 mm deep, into the surface of the cast. The gro ove should follow the edges of the connecto r’s design on soft tissue. Be careful not to  cut a bead  line  into  th e te eth. Fea ther the  lin e o ut when it approaches a gingival crest area and stop it about 1.5 mm short of the gingival crevice.  Figure 8.102. Maxillary Major Connector Bead Line.  8.42.1.2.  Mandibular  Tongue  Spaces. Trim  the tongue space with  a pneum atic chisel, as necessary, to prepare a surface for sprue leads.  The tongue area should be just belo w the level  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  445 of the pattern (bottom  edge of the m ajor connector) to allo w for a 15-degree incline from  the sprue to the pattern. CAUTION: Be aware of the thickness of the base. If the base will be les s than 10 mm after trimming the tong ue space, it may be necessary to firs t add stone to the bas e first to strengthen it. 8.42.1.3. Bases: (CAUTION: When trimming a m aster cast, be  careful to preserve the labial sulcus in areas that will require acrylic flanges.) 8.42.1.3.1. Ensure the sides of the base are trimmed at a 90-degree angle to the bottom of the cast. An undercut in the base will cause disto rtion of the duplicating m aterial when the cast is rem oved from  the mold. Trim  a s necessary.  If there is not adequate land area to trim , rebase the cast or block out with baseplate wax. 8.42.1.3.2. Remember, the m aster cast m ust fit in  the duplicating flask. Trim  oversized or thick bases.  8.42.1.3.3. Occlude with the opposing cast. Ensure the excess stone in the posterior regions does not interfere with occlusion. Trim as necessary. 8.42.1.4.  Blockout  and  Ledging  (Figure  8.103). The procedures to accom plish next are blockout an d  ledging. The  blockout  step elim inates all undesira ble tooth and soft tissue undercuts; ledging is a method of exposing the portion of desirable undercut used for retention.  Figure 8.103. Blockout, Ledging, and Relief.  446    Figure 8.104. Blockout for a Proposed Lingual Bar. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 8.42.1.4.1. Formula for Blockout Wax. The formula for making blockout wax consist of 9 sheets of baseplate wax, 9 sticks of gutta-per cha, 10 sticks of sticky wax, 1 tablespoon of kaolin powder, and a trace of sudan red for color. (One-half a tube of  red lipstick can be substituted for sudan red.) 8.42.1.4.2.  Blockout  of  Gross  Undercuts  Peripheral  to  the  Design. Check the tripod marks to be sure the cast is still properly  tripoded. Block out deep undercuts with baseplate wax if the undercuts are not directly related to the design. (Figure 8.103-A). These undercuts are m ost common in anterior facial and m andibular lingual areas (F igure 8.104). Stay at least 4 mm away from pattern  areas. Blocking out deep underc uts peripheral to the design allows the cast to be removed from the duplic ating material with th e least am ount of drag and resultant distortion. 8.42.1.4.3.  Application  of  Blockout  Wax. The fra mework design drawn on the cast is known as the “pattern.” All undercuts in the patte rn must be blocked out with blockout wax. The com bination of ingredients in blockouwithstand the pouring temperature of the duplicating  material without melting. Even a s light softening of the wax  could cause the tooled area to sag, which could result in undercut. This is why it is important to avoid the undercuts in the undercuts within the pattern, including the ruga e, rests, and under the tori (Figure 8.103-A). Overbulk the wax slightly. 8.42.1.4.4. Subduing:  pattern with all other waxes. Flow blockout wax into all t wax enables it to 8.42.1.4.4.1. This procedure fills th e small tissue crevices within th e framework design, thus smoothing the tissu e surface of the fram ework without creating m easurable space between it and the tissue. This results in a more sanitary appliance.  8.42.1.4.4.2. Wax should be hot enough to flow easily when applied. Subdue all rough tissue surfaces including edentulous ridge areas that will not have a relief pad.  8.42.1.4.4.3. Once the wax is applied, reminstrument. Be very careful not to scrape the cast. The only wax rem aining should be  filling in the crevices and rough areas. If any large amounts are present, remove that wax and replace it with blockout wax. Flam e the wa x just enough to sm ooth it, but not so it soaks into the stone. This would defeat the  purpose. (Blockout wax  may be used instead of subduing wax, but will not scrape off the cast as easily.)  8.42.1.4.4.4. The formula for making subduing wax is  two sheets of base plate wax, two ropes of beading or utility wax, and sudan red to color. ove as  m uch as possible with a dulled 8.42.1.4.5. Tooling (Figure 8.103-B). Select a blockout to ol and secure it  in the spindle of AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  447 the surveyor to trim the excess wax  from around each abutment tooth to create  parallelism. Heat the tool by lifting a bunsen burner to the surveyor and applying the flame to the tool. 8.42.1.4.5.1.  Step  1—Warming  the  Wax. T he tem perature of th e tool is  ex tremely important. Heat the tool just hot enough to m elt the wax. W ith the edge of the tool at a right angle to the tooth, warm the wax with the tool without contacting the tooth. 8.42.1.4.5.2. Step 2—Carving Off Excess Wax. Do not reheat the t ool. While it is  still warm, guide it around the tooth again. This tim e the edge of the tool  should contact the tooth along the survey line. Hold the top of the  vertical arm in such a way that it can be moved up and down to follow the contours of th e tissue at the base of the wax. At the same time, turn the vertical arm to keep the carving edge of the tool at a right angle to the tooth. The wax will already be warm, and the t ool should take off any  wax that is not in an undercut. CAUTION: Be careful not to abrade the cast with the tool. 8.42.1.4.6.  Cleanup. All wax above the survey line m ust be rem oved. Also use a sharp pointed instrument to remove  the wax from the proximals contacts upward.

Cut a ledge into th e wax on each clasped abutm ent according to th e exact position the retentive tip (term inal one-third  of the retentive arm ) is going to occupy (Figure 8.103-C).

Relief m ay be required for  no relief between the metal and the cast in distal extension partial deof m astication, the dow nward movement of the free end of the denture base causes the lower part of the lingual bar or plate to rotate toward the ridge. If the connector hits soft tissue a s the denture rotates, the tissue may become sore and could ulcerate. The am ount of major connector  relief is directly proportional to the estim ated a mount of dentur e base rotation. The potential for rotation increases as the length of the dista l extension defect increases. Rotation is greater in case s where the soft tissue in the distal extension area is very mobile. (There is no way to evaluate this factor.) The a mount of relief required is  also directly proportiona l to the slope of the  tissue under the major connector. As the lingual surface of the ri dge approaches vertical, the need for relief lessens. Two examples of distal extension cases showing differing conditions are as follows: 8.42.1.5.1.1. Case #1. The distal extension defect is shor t; it is cove red with firm tissue; and the surface of the alveolar ridge under th e major connector makes a vertical d rop to the floor of the mouth. This case would require a mere “flash” of molten wax as relief for the major connector (Figure 8.105-A). 448  Figure 8.105. Lingual Bar Relief Conditions.

At least one layer of  24-gauge adhesive co ated casting wax should be used for the relief procedure. 8.42.1.5.2.1.  Adapting  and  Cutting  the  Wax  To  Fit  the  Edentulous  Area  (Figure 8.103-D). Cut the wax about 1 to 2 mm short of th e internal finish line pattern to allow the finish line wax to be a pplied directly to the cast. CAUTIONS: 1. Do not cut the cast!  2. Casting wax is pressure sensitive. Applying too much pressure while adapting the wax over high spots will cause a thinning of the wax and, therefore, a thin area in the acrylic. 8.42.1.5.2.2. Finish Lines. Acrylic-metal joints are strongest when they are squared. Mix half baseplate wax and half blockout wax to make finish line wax. Apply a bead of this as a border on the relief pad. Extend it to meet the internal finish line pattern, cut it at a right angle to the cast, and blend it down to the level of the reli ef pad. The resulting corner should be sharp and square (90 degrees) (Figure 8.103-D). 8.42.1.5.2.3. Tissue Stop. If the RPD is of the distal extension variety, cut a hole about 2 mm square into the relief  wax over the cre st  of the alveolar ridge to provide a m etal “stop.” A stop holds the distal extension rete ntive grid off the cast during denture base packing procedures.

Metal flow principles hould be considered when positioning a sprue cone, as follows: and duplicating procedures s8.42.1.6.1.1. Metal Flow Principles. For the metal to flow ideally into the mold, the long axis of the sprue cone should be at a right  angle to the cast surfac e where the sprue lead will be waxed. In the “sink trap” concept, a liquid (molten metal, in this case) will find its own level. By adjusting the tilt of the sprue cone, it is possi ble to adjust the plane of the pattern within the investment mold.  8.42.1.6.1.2. Duplicating Procedures. If the tilt of  the sprue cone resu lts in an und ercut when the ca st is s et on the dup licating base , it will cause  d istortion of  the dup licating material in that area.  8.42.1.6.2. Attaching the Sprue Cone. Place the sprue co ne in a “lyin g down” position so  the tip is co ntacting the pattern. Tilt the cone  back to a vertical position and tack it down with baseplate wax considering m etal flow pr inciples (Figure 8.107). Hold the cast so that the base is level, like it will b e in the duplicating flask base. If the posterior of the s prue pin cause an undercut adjust the tilt of the pin as  necessary. Seal around the base of the pin with baseplate wax.  Figure 8.107. RPD Sprue Cone Positioning.  450  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 8.42.2.  Duplicating  the  Master  Cast. The production of any RPD framework is “technique sensitive.” That is, directions for producing the fr amework must be followed to the letter with no deviation.

If duplicating is to be  done on a regular basis or in large am ounts, use the auto-duplicator m ethod.  However, if duplicating is to be done only occasionally and in small quantities, use the microwave method. 8.42.2.1.1. Auto-Duplicator Method. The preparation and  storage varies accord ing to the brand of duplicating material and type of storage unit. An auto -duplicator has a storage tank in which hy drocolloid duplicating material is  heated until it reach es a liqu id state. It then  maintains the m aterial at pouring  tem perature  until it is  ready for use. In addition to a heating element, there is usua lly a stirring m echanism and a  pouring valve on the m achine. Refer to manufacturer instructions for more specific details. 8.42.2.1.2. Microwave Method: 8.42.2.1.2.1. This method uses a m icrowave, glass cookware with a cover, therm ometer, and spatula.  NOTE: Cookware such as Vis ions® works well becaus e it retain s the heat, allowing the material to cool more uniformly instead of gelling around the sides.  8.42.2.1.2.2.

If air bubbles follow the spocolloid, first cut the duplicating atula when stirring it, the 8.42.2.2. Soaking the Cast. The preferred method to soak a cast is to stand it on end in SDS (6 mm deep) for 20 to 30 m inutes. Casts m ade  from i mproved stones require a m uch longer soaking time. The SDS is kept at 90  oF, plus or minus 2 oF. The cast will wet th rough capillary action. If large areas of the cast are relieved with sheet wax, soak the cast with the teeth pointed downward. This will enable the air to escape up through the porous stone base instead of lifting the wax off the tissue surfaces of the cast. 8.42.2.3. Assembling the Duplicating Flask. The duplicating flask (Figure 8.108) consists of the base, body, and spout. There are two flask sizes . Select the one that provides at least one-half of an inch clearance between the edge of the cast and the rim of the base (Figure 8.109-A). Place Ticene (clay) in the rim of the base. This serves the following two important purposes:  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  451 8.42.2.3.1. It forms a seal between the base and body of the flask so the colloid does not leak while the duplication is being made. 8.42.2.3.2. It acts as an insulator during the cooling process. Soak the cast completely, center it on the base of the flask, and secu re it with  a small piece of Ticene (clay) on each  side. Press the body firmly in place on  the base and  seat the spou t. Place a s mall ball of Ticene behind each of the vent holes on the body (Figure 8.109-B).  Figure 8.108. Duplicating Flask Parts.  Figure 8.109. Assembling the Duplicating Flask.  8.42.2.4.  Pouring  the  Hydrocolloid. Draw off a s mall amount  of duplicating m aterial (about 150 cc) to rem ove any cl ots or settled stone particles. Position the flask under the duplicator’s pouring valve and op en it until the duplicating m aterial flows in a stream  a s wide as a p encil (Figure 8.110). Fill the body  until the colloid reaches  the level of the two vent holes. Plug the vents with  Ticene. Continue fill ing the flask until th e spout is at least 2/3 full.  452  Figure 8.110.

For best results, cooling should start at the base of the flask and gradually work its way up. This pattern ensures the most intim ate contact between the duplicating m aterial and the surface of the  cast. Place the flask  in a flat pan that  circulates water. Regulate the level of the watetemperature of the water has to be below the te mperature of the room, but no less than 55 oF. A small flask usually cools in 30 minutes, while a large flask requires 45 minutes. 8.42.2.6. Extracting the Master Cast (Figure 8.111-B). After the flask is cool, remove the  pouring spout by twisting it out. Cut off the separate the body from the base. Insert a knife in to each of the depressions left by the dabs of Ticene used to hold the cast down. Using the flask walls as fulcrums, elevate the master cast out of the hydrocolloid with a  quick snap. Try to lift both side s of th e cast at the s ame time. (Lifting only one side tends to tear and otherwise distort the impression.) Check the impression for sprue cones and relief wax that might have been left behind. 8.42.2.7. Pouring the Refractory Cast. Use Ticonium investment (Investic) for the refractory cast. The properties of Investic have been mraction behavior of Ticonium metal.

Preparing a Dental Stone Duplicate of the Blocked Out Master Cast. Remove the “A” or “D” sprue cone and relief pads. Use a duplicating flask to make another reversible hydrocolloid impression of the blocked out m aster cast. Pour this im pression with a mix of vacuum spatulated dental stone. The major reason for the dental stone duplicate is to test f it the Ticonium casting. The initial test fitting of a framework is rarely done on the m aster cast itself for fear of dam aging the surface o f the cast. A nother purpose for using the duplicate blocke d out m aster cast is th at it can be mounted on  an articulator and used as a vehicle for occlusion adjustments on the casting. 8.44. Preparing the Refractory Cast for Pattern Fabrication. Before casting an RPD fram ework in metal, a fully representative pattern of the proposed framework is made from wax and preformed plastic patterns on the refractory cast. Next, the refractorencasement of additional investm ent. The whole asse mbly is subjected to high heat, burning out the pattern. This leaves a void into which m olten metal is cast, and it form s a metal reproduction of the original pattern. The refractory cast cannot be used in  its present state. The  cast is wet and porous, and its base is too big. Before a pattern can be fabricated on the investment cast, the cast must be prepared to receive it. Follow the steps below: y cast and associated pattern are covered by an 8.44.1. Trim the Cast (Figure 8.112-A). Use an indelible pencil to  draw an outline about 6 m m from the extremities of the proposed pattern. Adjust the cast trimmer’s table to a 45-degree angle. This angle makes the cast easier to hold during waxing and also allows it to “lock into” the outer investment mold.  Wet-grind the  cast to  the  pe nciled outline. Do  not touch the abutm ent teeth (Figure 8.112-A). Rubbing your fingers across an abutm ent tooth can drastically affect the fit of a clasp because the investment is soft and abrades very easily. Now, rinse the cast in SDS to remove any slush accumulation from the grinding procedure. 8.44.2. Dehydrate the Cast. Dry the investm ent cast in a vent ed dehydrating oven for 1 hour at 190 oF (Figure 8.112-B). The color of the cast will change from gray when wet to white when dry. 8.44.3. Wax-Dip the Cast (Figure 8.112-C):  ) it provides a sm ooth, dense surface on 8.44.3.1. The advantages of a beeswax dip are: (1which to construct a pattern, and (2) it does not absorb water from  secondary investments. This eliminates the need for soaking the cast before investing.  8.44.3.2. Melt refined beeswax in a therm ostatically controlled pot. The  dipping temperature should be 280 - 300  oF. A good indicator of proper tem perature is when the wax first begins to smoke. Place the cast on some kind of wire carrier (potato masher) and immerse it in the heated beeswax. Watch for a f oaming action. Let the re fractory cast stay subm erged for 15 seconds after the foaming begins.  8.44.3.3. Remove the cast, blow off any excess wax, and place the cast on a piece of absorbent paper to cool. Move it to another position after a few seconds so the wax does not collect on the base. After the refractory cast has cooled down completely, it is ready for pattern application. 8.44.4. Transfer the Design from the Master Cast to the Refractory Cast (Figure 8.113). It is very important to perform this procedure as accu rately as possible. W hen transferring the design, follow this sequence: m ajor connector, retention gr ids, resin veneer facings, reinforced acrylic pontics or facings, clasps and rests, and m inor connectors. The transferred lines must be v isible without scuffing the cast. All markings associated with the transfer of a design to a refractory cas t are made with a wax-base pencil. (If a graphite penc il is used, the particles could cause pits in the framework casting.) AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 8.112. Preparing the Refractory Cast for Pattern Fabrication. 455  Figure 8.113. Design Transfer to the Refractory Cast.  8.45.  Fabricating  the  Framework  Pattern  on  the  Refractory  Cast. The m ost popular m ethod of constructing a pattern for a fram ework consists of using ready-made, preformed wax (Figure 8.114) and plastic parts. Join the parts by  careful freehand waxing. Use freehand  waxing to modify areas of the  overall pattern where ad ditional strength and rig idity might be needed in m etal casting. Choose from  a large assortment of preformed shapes and sizes ranging from controlled thicknesses of sheet casting wax to plastic clasp arm s. Many cases can be waxed up so  the only freehand waxing necessary is to flow i n the rests, connect the preformed parts, and es tablish the finish lines. Besides the desirable convenience 456  factor, the use of preformed parts ensures a standard of quality in the finished framework that is difficult to achieve in any other way. Manufacturer’s catalogs provide a wide variety of choices.  Figure 8.114. Preformed Wax Shapes. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  8.45.1.  Principles  of  Pattern  Construction. The key factors in successful RPD pattern construction are as follows: 8.45.1.1. Follow the design accurately. 8.45.1.2. Use pliable preformed parts that readily conform to the surfaces of the refractory cast. 8.45.1.3. Be sure the parts are stuck down to a properly sealed cast. 8.45.1.4. Comply with a definite construction sequence where the larger components are placed first and the smaller ones are progressively placed in an orderly manner. 8.45.1.5. Contour th e junctions of v arious pattern parts into graceful cu rves to m inimize soft tissue abuse and tongue irritation. 8.45.1.6. Smooth the surfaces of the pattern  to reduce th e m etal finishing tim e. Use a tacky  liquid  to apply preform ed parts to a  refractory cast. The liquid binds  the pattern  to the cast.  There are many brand nam es of tacky liquid on the  commercial market. It is possible to m ake an adequate tacky liquid by dissolving old plas tic patterns in acetone. Som e technicians pain t the design with tacky liquid before they apply the preformed part. Others apply the tacky liquid to the part before they put it on the cast. This  is a matter of personal choice. However, keep in mind that any excess tacky liquid casts in metal and produces fins. 8.45.2. Waxing Framework Patterns. The suggested construction sequence is as follows: major connector, acrylic resin retention  grids, artif icial teeth (re sin ven eer facings, reinforced acrylic  pontics, or facings), clasps, rests, m inor connect ors, and external finish  lines. The final step  consists of sm oothing t he pattern with a piec e of nylon or with wax solvent on a cotton tip applicator followed by water. It is possible to f lame the pattern to rem ove small irregularities for those technicians with skill and courage. 8.45.2.1. Maxillary Framework Patterns. Before applying wax or plastic preform patterns, fill in the pa latal bead lines w ith inlay wax flush with the s urface of the cast. Flow wax along  the edges of  the relief pads, extending the wax  1 mm onto the relief pad. If the RPD m ajor connector is going to cover the rugae, flow a rugae. This will ensu re against thin spots wh en adapting sh eet-casting wax or stip pled sheet over the rugae. Waxing for a m axillary RPD framework pattern is shown in Figure 8.115. The  steps in the figure are as follows: A—Fill in the bead lines, relief pads, and flash wax over the small amount of wax on the high areas of the AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  457 rugae; B—Adapt the major connector; C—Flow  inlay wax to for m lingual plating; D—Adapt  retention grids; E—W ax the RAP site (detaiPlace rest and external finish lines; and H—Finish line detail in polished framework. ls in paragraph 8.46.1); F--Position clasps; G— Figure 8.115.

Finish Lines—A Special Note. Superimposing an external finish line directly over an internal f inish line tend s to  create a weak jun ction be tween a  retention grid and  the m ajor connector. Instead, see Figures 8.117 and 8.118 for  the proper relationship. Use the edentulous spaces as the reference and position the external finish lines  about 1.0 to 1.5 mm peripheral to (outside of) the internal lines.  Figure 8.116.

(NOTE: The primary credit for developi ng RAP is given to the US Army Dental Corps.) The RAP is an anterio r acrylic res in denture too th attached to  a specially  constructed retentive site on the  framework. The denture tooth is ad apted to the edentulous space on the master cast, and the retention for the tooth is incorporated into the framework pattern on the refractory cast. Procedures for fabrication are shown in Figure 8.120 and as follows: AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 8.117. Finish Line Detail Showing the Toothborne Area. 459  Figure 8.118.

The dentist should either index the upper and lower casts in MI or provide a jaw relationship record for mounting purposes. 8.46.1.2. Adapt the denture tooth (teeth) and wax-up for the RAP site as follows: 8.46.1.2.1. If the dentist agrees, prepare the sitetooth will contact the ridge. This is done by first rubbing a pencil over the edentulous area to  by scraping the cast where the artificial 460  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 completely color the area where the replacement tooth will be. With a Hollenbeck, or similar sharp carving instrument, lightly scrape off the pencil marks. Scrape only heavily enough to remove the pencil m arks. Do not attem pt to “l evel” the r idge irregularities, but f ollow the contours of the tissue. Repeat the process two more times or as directed by the dentist. 8.46.1.2.2. If the dentist does not adapt denture teeth to th e edentulous space and provide a matrix for positioning those teeth, follow his or her directions and select the mold and shade of the plastic denture teeth. 8.46.1.2.3. Grind as necessary to adapt the pro ximal and ridgelap areas of the teeth to the space (Figure 8.120-A). Next, cut a box-lik e recess into the tooth from the lingual. The box should be slightly dovetailed to ward the center of the tooth.  Take care when grinding the recess into the tooth; if the recess is too deep, the metal post may show through the facial of the finished RAP. The floor of the recess parall els the facial surface of the tooth. The incisal edge and the m esial and distal  marginal ridge areas of the toot h should be pr eserved intact (Figure 8.120-B).  8.46.1.2.4. Apply a separating medium to the cast. Using th e adjacent and opposing teeth as guides, temporarily position the denture teeth on the cast with utility wax. 8.46.1.2.5. Make a stone m atrix over the setup (F igure 8.120-C). Include in the matrix the incisal edges of the denture teeth and  abutment teeth. Do not bring the stone  over the incisal edge and onto the lingual surface of the abutm ent teeth. This may cause the stone abutm ent teeth to break when removing the m atrix.  Involve only one natural tooth on each end. Extend the facial of the m atrix as fa r as possi ble without entering areas of the m aster cast that are going to be blocked out. Do not cover m ore than two  thirds of the facial of the denture teeth because access to the necks will be needed to seal the RAP’s to the ridge.  8.46.1.2.6. Carefully remove the stone m atrix and trim away the excess stone. ( CAUTION: A matrix made on the diagnostic cast will usually not fit the master cast.) A matrix made of silicone putty will not allow wax to stick to it,  so the teeth will not stay in it and it flexes too much for an accurate seat. 8.46.1.2.7. Select a plastic backing m anufactured for facing support. Cut the backing material slightly smaller than the recess in the lingual aspect of a prepared denture tooth. 8.46.1.2.8. With the matrix and teeth position ed accurately on the refracto ry cast, tack the backing material into the recess of the dentur e tooth using a  small dot of utility wax. Next,  seal the backing to th e cast with inlay wax.

Avoid the prevailing tendency to place the finish line to o far to th e lingual. Ch eck the occlusion. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 8.120. RAP Fabrication. 461   8.46.1.3. Finish the RAP metal backing (Figure 8.120-H): 8.46.1.3.1. The casting is finished in the usual m anner and initially seated on a duplicate of the master cast. Notch the m esial and dis tal sides of the metal back ing with a thin , high-speed separating disc. F inally, lingually bevel th e incisal end of the backing about 45 to 60 degrees. This allows the backing more length for strength, and there is less possibility for the backing to punch through the resin used to fill in the recess. 8.46.1.3.2. Match the m aster cast, fra mework, dent ure teeth, and m atrix into their proper relationships. Verify the metal backings fit the denture tooth recesses acceptably. If there is any binding, remove metal as necessary. 8.46.1.4. Process the R AP as follows: ( NOTE: Before processing the RAP, coat the facial surface of the m etal backing with a suitab le opaque to prevent m etal showing through to the facial of the denture teeth.) 462  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 8.46.1.4.1. Autopolymerizing Resin Method (Figure 8.120-I). RAPs are routinely attached to fram eworks with autopolym erizing tooth-co lored resin. Paint the  residual ridge with a tinfoil substitute, sea t the f ramework on th e c ast, pos ition the tee th with the  m atrix, and apply the self-curing resin. Com plete the cure in a pressure pot containing water at about 110 oF at 15 psi for 10 minutes. 8.46.1.4.2. Heat-Curing Resin. When heat-curing denture base  resin is going to be used t o process posterior teeth to the framework, it is convenient to attach the RAP with heat-curing, tooth-colored resin at the same time. Place the denture teeth destined to become RAPs in the matrix and position  on the c ast. Wax-up the lingual contour of the d enture teeth with pink  baseplate wax. Place enough wax to completely fill in the recess and allow enough m aterial for finishing and polishing. During the packing pha se of the processing procedure, use heat-curing, tooth-colored resin in the RAP areas. 8.46.2. Braided Post Retention for Posterior Teeth:  8.46.2.1. Steps For Fabricating the Framework With a Braided Post: 8.46.2.1.1. Adapt a stipple sheet to  the edentulous space and s eal it down. Make a braided post from two 18 to 21-gauge round wax prefor ms. For strength, twis t the wax into  a tight spiral. 8.46.2.1.2. Proper placement of the wax post is esse ntial for processing th e denture tooth in the proper position. A post shou ld be positioned so it lies in  the center of each denture tooth (Figure 8.121). The technician waxing the fr amework must know where the denture tooth will be positioned. Use the teeth anterior and posterior as guides for spacing. Fasten the base of the post to the stipple sheet. Hold the refractory cast and the opposing cast together in MI. The tip of the post should fall over the line of stamp cusps in the opposing arch.   Figure 8.121. Braided Post Retention.  8.46.2.1.3. Stick retention beads down to the stipple sheet. 8.46.2.1.4.

If using autopolymerizing resin,  rem ember to m ake a m atrix f irst (paragraph 8.46.1.2.5). 8.46.2.2.6. Adjust the occlusion and polish. 8.46.3. Resin Veneer Substructures. A resin veneer is a light-cured com posite material that is retained on the fram ework by eith er mechanical or chem ical bonding (or possibly both). Several resin systems are available on the m arket today. Resin veneers are an alternative to denture te eth when the ed entulous space is  small and a den ture tooth would need to be  greatly reduced to f it. They also work well when special staining or co ntours are required to achieve the n ecessary end results. Procedures to fabricate a resin veneer are shown in Figure 8.122 and as follows: 8.46.3.1.  Resin  Veneer  Substructure  Design. Resin veneers are less  abrasive resistant than  commercially fabricated denture teeth and facings.  As such, the metal substructure portions of tooth replacem ents should be m ade to protect the acrylic ve neers from  abrasion and wear. Ensure metal guide planes are used f or lateral excursions. This will help to eliminate shearing stresses on the resin. M echanical retention for the veneer is ga ined by using retention beads, loops, or bar retention. Ch emical retention is achieved by a pplying a silicate layer to the m etal surface. This silicate layer then bonds to the resin.  8.46.3.2. Waxing the Pontic. Wax to full contour when a metal lingual or occlusal is necessary due to lateral excursion requirem ents (Figure  8.122-A). Pay special atte ntion to detail on the lingual and incis al or occlusal surfaces because  they will be in m etal on the finished product.  Check occlusal contacts and lateral excursions.  If a m etal lingual or occlusal is not necessary, simply position a braide d post in the center of  the area where the res in tooth will b e (Figure 8.122-B). It is essential that the  post is positioned in the center to  allow for adequate thickness of resin around the post. 8.46.3.3.  Cutting  Back  the  Full  Contour  Wax-Up  Pontic.  The facial of the w ax pontic substructure is hollowed out to a  minimum depth of 3 mm. Unlike porcelain, the com posite resin does not require an even thickness. The po ntic can be completely hollowed out, resulting in easier casting of the fram ework and a lighter final appliance.  An anterior pontic can be thin enough to begin to see light through it.  CAUTION: When the wax is this thin, it can easily be distorted. 8.46.3.4. Use of Mechanical Retention. If mechanical retention is to be used, place V-shaped columns of 20-gauge round wax in the hollowed  out area, taking care to leave enough space behind it for the com posite material to wrap around it (8.122-C). Beads m ay also be applied to the cutback and the columns (Figure 8.122-D).  CAUTION A minimum space of 1 mm m ust be m aintained between the m echanical retention and the restored facial surface. This space is needed to accommodate the opaque and minimal body shade of the resin m aterial. To determine if there is enough clearance, look directly down at the top of the occlusal  or incisal surface. No beads or colum ns should be visible. The m ost common area to find retention  that is too far facially is the incisal of anteriors. Remove beads or reposition columns if necessary. 8.46.3.5. After the fram ework is finished and polis hed, the resin can be  applied (paragraph 8.58). 464  Figure 8.122. Resin Veneer Fabrication. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  8.47.  Incorporating  Combination  Clasp  Retentive  Arms  into  a  Ticonium  Framework. Ticonium wire is used in military dental laboratories to make the wire arm on a combination clasp. Platinum-gold-palladium wire was once used quite extensively before precious metals became prohibitively expensive. Combination bar clasps can be m ade, but combinat ion circumferential clasps  are much m ore popular. The retentive arm of a com bination circumferential clasp is usually shaped fr om 18- or 19-gauge steel Ticonium wire. The heavier 18-gauge wire is used for long clasp arms, and the 19-gauge wire is used for shorter arms. The amount of undercut usually engaged by a wire retentive arm is 0.020 inches. 8.47.1. Advantages of the Combination Circumferential Clasp: 8.47.1.1. A cast clasp arm  flexes m ostly in the horizontal plane.  A wire clasp arm  flexes both vertically and horizontally and is thought to exert less destructive force on a tooth. 8.47.1.2. Some dentists believe a wire clasp covers  less tooth surface an d contributes less to decay. 8.47.1.3. Round wire is used in sm aller diam eters  than cast clasps. A reflects light in such a way that it is less noticeable than the larger cast clasp. smaller, round wire 8.47.2. Disadvantages of the Combination Circumferential Clasp: AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  465 8.47.2.1. Because wire clasp arm s are generally m ore flexible than cast clasp arms, they are more easily bent out of shape. 8.47.2.2. The wire clasp m ust be adapted to the cas t so contact with the tooth is maintained throughout the length of the wire. This is difficult to do.  Spaces rep resent food  traps and potential sites of decay. 8.47.2.3. The use of wire sacrifices some of the bracing provided by a completely cast clasp. 8.47.2.4. The m ost common ways to unite a wire  clasp arm with the fra mework when using Ticonium m etal are to cast m olten m etal a gainst the  wire or  to solder  the  wire to  the framework. Critics m aintain that th is reduces the flexibility of the wire b y at leas t 30 percent. This effect can be drastically reduced in the so lder method by using the “solder to the retentive grid area” method (paragraph 8.47.3.3). 8.47.2.5. When Ticonium  metal is cast to Ticonium or platinum -gold-palladium wire, no metallurgical union occurs between the casting and  the wire. Any resistance the wire shows to being pulled out of  the casting is strictly mechanical. The bends m ade in the nonclasp portion (tang) of the wire become critically important. (Mechanical retention depends on these angles.) 8.47.2.6. Cusp im pacts in centric occlusion frequen tly contraindicate the  use of wire. The 18-gauge wire and the cast metal necessary to surround it (sleeve) require considerable clearance. 8.47.3.  Procedures  For  Attaching  the  Wire  Clasp. The dentist’s opinion about the effects of heat on the physical properties of wire determines the way to attach a wire clasp arm  to the framework. Choices for attaching a wire clasp include the “cast to” method, “soldered to the minor connector” technique, or “soldered to the retentiv e grid area” method. In another method, the tang of a wire clasp arm  is buried in  the resin of the denture base.  This is the m ost common way to replace a broken clasp arm  (paragraph 8.70). No  matter which m ethod is used, a wire clasp arm must be ben t to conform to the sh ape of the tooth. Most of the tim e, the arm  will be  part of a circumferential clasp. Keep the tang long so it can be bent for use in one of these techniques: 8.47.3.1. “Cast-To” Method (Figure 8.123). The wire retentive arm is included in the wax-up on the refractory cast, and later molten metal is “cast to” the embedded wire as follows:  Figure 8.123. “Cast-To” Method.  8.47.3.1.1. Contour the wrought wire arm to the tooth on the master cast or on a duplicate. It is cr itically im portant to adap t the  entire leng th of  the c lasp to the tooth, including the shoulder of the clasp. Mechanical retention comes from a loop or well-defined bends placed in the tang of the wire. 466  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 8.47.3.1.2.

Figure 8.124. “Soldered to the Minor Connector” Technique.  8.47.3.3.  “Soldered  to  the  Retentive  Grid  Area”  Method  (Figure  8.125). This m ethod is  essentially the same as the one described for soldering the wrought arm to the minor connector. The difference is that the tang is left longer so  the wire can be soldered  to the retentive grid instead. An advantage is that application of heat is far removed from the clasp arm proper. 8.47.3.4. Twin-Flex Wires (Figure 8.126). When esthetics is a primary consideration (anterior tooth replacem ents) or when the only available abutment tooth, the twin-flex wire m ay be indi cated.

To create th e space in the plating for the  wire to flex, cover the p art of the wire that will flex with a “sleeve”  of blockout wax.

Section 8F—Spruing, Investing, Burnout, and Casting 8.48. Spruing the Wax Pattern: 8.48.1. Introduction:  8.48.1.1. Spruing provides a pathway through w hich molten metal can flow during the casting procedure. In addition, the sprue acts as a reservoir for m olten m etal  immediately after the framework is cast. Metal rem ains liquid longer  in the heavier parts of the casting. Because a sprue is the bulkies t part, it feeds the lighter sections while cooling cont raction is taking place (compensates for metal shrinkage).  8.48.1.2. The two ways to distribute  sprue leads to a pattern are  single and multiple. A single sprue is used on patterns that get progressively  smaller in volum e from the sprue’s point of attachment to the outer reaches. If m etal has to  flow throu gh a thin  section to reach a h eavy section, a secondary or “auxiliary” sprue lead may be run to the dependent area.  8.48.1.3. The Ticonium  Company maintains that m ost Ticonium castings can be m ade from a single sp rue. The m ain sprue f or a Ticonium  casting will eithe r f ollow the  overjet  spruing principle or take the shape of an oversprue. 8.48.2. Overjet Spruing. Because the m ain sprue in  this s ystem passes throug h the base of th e cast, overjet spruing is used f or mandibular patterns and f or maxillary patterns that do not f ully cover the palate. Instead of having wax leads come off the tip of the main sprue, the wax leads exit the main sprue below its tip (F igure 8.127). Run off as m any auxiliary wax leads from  the m ain sprue as the pattern requires.  Figure 8.127. Overjet Spruing.  8.48.2.1. Advantages of Overjet Spruing. Molten metal turbulence at the entrance to the mold cavity is reduced and the molten metal has less scuffing effect on the investment. The tip of the main sprue (overjet portion) acts  to catch particles of investment that might be broken loose by the initial rush of molten metal. These factors act to r educe the incidence of metal pitting and  miscast components in castings. O verjet sprues keep the line of feed open longer to supply molten metal to the casting. This tends to produce denser castings. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  8.48.2.2. Procedures for Overjet Spruing: 469 8.48.2.2.1. Attaching a Wax Lead to the Pattern. Make the wax lead  long enough so one end of it co ntacts the p attern and the other end of it slightly  projects over the m ain sprue hole. Use 6-gauge round wax for spru ing. Pinch one end to achieve the  garden hose effect. Attach the wax lead to  the m ajor connector. Se al all s ides of the wax lead. Use addition al wax to widen the lead to equal the width of the sprue cone. 8.48.2.2.2. Attaching the Main Sprue Cone. Take a stainless steel “C” sprue cone, heat the cone over a Bunsen burner, and in sert it through the refractory cast. Seal the wax lead to the sprue cone three-sixteenths (3/16) of an inch below the tip to produce the required overjet. Blend the junctions of the wax lead into the “C” cone and into the pattern . This will produce a wedge shape. Seal around the cone to ensure its stability. 8.48.2.3. Examples of Single and Multiple Lead Overjet Spruing: 8.48.2.3.1. A single sprue is used on fra meworks where molten metal does not have to pass through thin sections to bulkier sections (Figure 8.128-A).  Figure 8.128. Spruing Examples.  8.48.2.3.2. Multip le sp rues are u sed on cases where the m etal m ust flow through a thin  section to reach a bulk ier section. Som e cas es require do uble m ain leads to the m ajor connector. Two examples are: 8.48.2.3.2.1. Anterior-posterior palatal strap a(Figure 8.128-B). 8.48.2.3.2.2. Lingual bars with m inor connectors that  support anterior tooth backings or supplemental Kennedy bars. The sprue leads form  a “V.” Do not m ake the attachment or the sprues to the lingual bar directly in line  with the m inor connector or the bulky area. Always attach the sprue leads before or after the bulky spot. nd closed horseshoe m ajor connectors 8.48.2.3.3. Som e cases require a sm aller auxiliary  sprue lead to a dependent part of the pattern (10- to 12-gauge round wax pref orm) (Figure 8.128-C). Exa mples of thisrequirement are isolated, large clasps on molar abutments and the presence of heavy pontics. Attach the auxiliary sprue near the bulky area and arch the sprue so its highest point is above the top of the clasp or pontic. 8.48.2.3.4. Internal spruing can be u sed on maxillary RPDs to guide m etal directly to areas  that m ay be  at risk of not casting. These include approach arm s, ring clasps, RAPs, and metal dumm ies or resin veneer  substructures. Strategic p arts of  th e p attern a re th ickened internally, or under the component (major connector, denture retention), in the wax-up to aid the flow of metal to particular components when cast. 470  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 8.48.3.  Overspruing. Overspruing is used on full palate m axillary RPDs or in  an y case where  overjet spruing is difficult. Suspend a wax sprue cone inverted over the  pattern. The tip should extend just below the height of the pattern. A ttach 8- or 10-gauge round wax sprue leads three-sixteenths (3/16) of an inch from  the tip (Fig ure 8.129). U se 3 or 4 leads  attached to the outer  borders of the pattern. To prevent porosity and aid in finishing, add a tab made of wax or stipple to the pattern and attach the sprue lead there. Simply cut it off during the finishing process.  Figure 8.129. Overspruing a Maxillary Major Connector.  8.48.4. Troubleshooting Spruing Problems: 8.48.4.1. If the m ain sprue and its lead s are not sealed at their junc tions as described, there is serious potential for ledges of investm ent to pr otrude into the sprue channels. The current ofmolten metal breaks off any thin projections and  carries them into the casting. This causes pits in the m etal. If the particle of investm ent is big enough, it m ay block access to th e terminal parts of the mold. 8.48.4.2. After the pattern and cast are com pletely invested, heat the “C” cone before removal. The wax used to seal the cone is less likely to  pull par ticles of  inve stment into the spru e channel. 8.48.4.3. After flattening off the surface of the mol d, run a pencil size stream  of water into the sprue hole to blow out any investment that might have fallen in. 8.48.4.4. Keep the sprue pins absolutely free of set investment particles.  8.49. Selecting the Type and Amount of Ticonium Metal Needed: 8.49.1. Type of Ticonium Metal: 8.49.1.1. Number #100 Metal. This metal is used for routine RPD castings. An ingot com es in large (5/8 inch) and small (7/16 inch) diameters and in a variety of lengths. 8.49.1.2. Number #44 Metal. This type is use d for cast m etal, complete denture bases. The  ingot is grooved so it is easily distinguished from  Ti conium #100. The #44 m etal is not recommended for frameworks carrying cast clasps. 8.49.1.3. Number #25 Metal. This metal is used to cas t metal stru ctures that are going to be surgically implanted. It is form ulated to cause as little adverse tissue reaction as possible. The metal is not intended for routine RPD castings. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  8.49.2. Amount of Metal:  471 8.49.2.1. The best way to estim ate the am ount needed for a fram ework casting is to use the Ticonium metal m iser (Figure 8.13 0). The Ticonium  m etal m iser is  a circular ca lculator. It consecutively adds valu e for each part of the case and reads out the total directly. The  calculator also m atches  the total weight com puted to a m etal ingot size. The ingot size is written down for future reference.   Figure 8.130. Ticonium Metal Miser.  8.49.2.2. When the pattern and the refr actory cast are flasked, a wet  paper towel is used in the procedure. It is comm on practice to write the i ngot size on the towel w ith an indelible pencil and to keep the paper towel with the case until it is used. 8.50. Investing the Pattern and Refractory Cast. The cas e with its wax patte rn and attached sprue cone is em bedded in a m ix of refr actory casting investm ent (Investic). After the in vestment hardens, it oF) elim inates the  patte rn itse lf. The preserves the pattern form  ev en though the burnout heat (1350 requirements of the investm ent are strength to contain the rush of molten metal, surface smoothness so the resultant casting is smooth, a certain am ount of  porosity to allow gases in the m old to escap e, and expansion to compensate for shrinkage of the m etal after casting. Investing is acco mplished as follows: (1) apply the “paint-on” layer ov er the pattern and the cas t and (2) fu ll-flask the pattern and refractory cast (Figures 8.131 and 8.132). 8.50.1. Applying the “Paint-On” Layer: 8.50.1.1. Dip the waxed up refractory cast in a surface tension reducer agent (debubblizer). 8.50.1.2. Proportion and m ix the investm ent for  the paint-on layer (Figure 8.131-B). The correct water to powder ratio is 30 cc of room temperature distilled water to 100 gm of powder. Either hand spatulate the investment for 60 seconds or mechanically mix it for 30 seconds. This amount should be enough for about 4 cases. 8.50.1.3. Paint on the investment (Figure 8.131-C) as follows:  472  Figure 8.131. Investing the Pattern and Refractory Cast. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  8.50.1.3.1. Blow off any excess debubblizer that is puddled on the refractory cast. 8.50.1.3.2. Pick up some investment on a brush. Vibrate the investment ahead of the brush to cover the entire wax pattern and sprue uniform ly. A strong vibrator is needed for the job; small electromechanical vibrators are not adequate.  8.50.1.3.3. Keep the thickness of  the paint-on  layer as uniform as possible. (About 3 mm  is considered proper.) Avoid investment buildup in the palate of a maxillary cast. Avoid letting investment accumulate under a mandibular lingual bar pattern. Be careful not to trap any air bubbles. Painting on a thin layer is essential  to permit the escape of gases produced during burnout. An even layer helps contribute toward uniform expansion of the investment. 8.50.1.4. W ith the slotted end of a sprue down, rest the investm ent cast on a pouring spout taken from a duplicating flask or an ice cube tra y. Do not set the freshly painted cast where it may be affected  by bench vib rations becau se th e investm ent layer w ill flow and  lose its thickness and uniformity. 8.50.1.5. After the paint-on layer has reached final set  (about 10 minutes), it is ready to be full flasked. 8.50.2.  Full-Flasking  the  Pattern  and  Refractory  Cast. A set of Ticonium   flasks contains a  selection of seven sizes of stai nless steel flask f ormers (150 gm  to 700 gm ). They are split-type flask formers held together with a clip. Procedu res for flasking the pattern and refractory cast are as follows: AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  473 8.50.2.1. Select a flask that allows one-fourth (1/4 ) to one-half (1/2) inch of clearance between the refractory cast and the sides of the flask. 8.50.2.2. Proportion the investm ent with water to  powder ratio of 30 cc  water to 100 gm  of investment. Either hand spatulate the m ixture  for 60 seconds or do it m echanically for 30 seconds. Do not subject the mix to vacuum. 8.50.2.3. Put the flask o n a metal bench top o r glass slab and fill the flask about three-quarters  full. The metal bench top or glass slab will not absorb any water from the investment mixture. 8.50.2.4. Properly align the m old cavity with the cas ting machine’s direction of spin to aid the flow of metal. Line up the case with the flask seam during the investment procedure. The flask seam is a feature that always appears on the  surface of the mold. During casting, the seam  will be the leading edge when the casting arm spins. Investing the most distant parts of the pattern away from the seam will put them at the trailing edge, thereby forcing the metal into these parts using centrifugal force.  8.50.2.5. Dip the refractory cast in water and blow off the excess. This will prevent the paint on layer from absorbing water out of the investment mixture. 8.50.2.6. Grasp the refractory cast by the “C” cone and begin to settle the cast into the flask. Be  careful not to trap air in the palate or tongue space (Figure 8.131-D). 8.50.2.7. Use the following principles when spruing cases with “overjet” method: 8.50.2.7.1. If a cast has a single sprue lead, orient the lead toward the seam . EXCEPTION: If there is no pattern distal to the sprue pin, orient the lead away from the seam. 8.50.2.7.2. If an auxiliary sprue is used in addition lead toward the seam. to a m ain lead, always direct the m ain any distant or thin areas oriented away 8.50.2.8. “Oversprue” cases should be invested with from the seam. 8.50.2.9. Sink the cast in the investm ent material until the paint-on laye r is about 6 mm from the bottom of the flask for all “overjet” cases. (It is good practice to mark the stopping point on the sprue cone before sinking the refractory cas t.) For “oversprue” cases, do not hold the sprue to sink the cast becaus e this m ay break the sprue leads. The part of the sprue where the leadsattach must be at least 4 mm below the top of the investment. 8.50.2.10. Make sure the refractory cast displaces e nough investment so the flask is completely full. If more investment is required, it can eas ily be added. Just before the investm ent reaches initial set, use a wide flat edged blade to rem ove any excess investm ent above the top of the flask (Figure 8.132-A). Ensure the mold is exactly the sam e height as the investment ring. This will allow the mold to fit properly into the casting machine. Allow the investment to reach final set (15 minutes).  8.50.2.11. Remove the “C” cone by first heating it  and then placing the dull edge of  a brown-handled knife in the slot and twistin g slightly until the sprue cone drops out (Figure 8.132-B). Be sure the sprue hole opening is smooth and sh arp. If necessary, lightly sand the edges of the sprue hole until smooth. 8.50.2.12. Blow loose particles of investm ent out of  the sprue hole with a stream  of water. Visually inspect the sprue hole and repeat as necessary.  474  Figure 8.132. “Face Off” the Mold and Mark the Ingot Size. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  8.50.2.13. Remove the clip and slide off the flask former. 8.50.2.14. Mark the ingot size on th e bottom of the m old with  jeweler’s rouge (Figure 8.132-C). 8.50.2.15. Make sure the level of moisture within the m ass of the investment remains relatively constant. Store the molds in plastic bags to maintain their moisture content. 8.51.  Burnout  of  the  Pattern  and  Casting  the  Framework. The typical burnout and casting setup consists of a Ticonium  twin controller, an elec tric oven, and a Ticom atic casting machine. The burnout is perform ed in an oven. (For pho tographs of  this  equ ipment, see Volum e 2, Chapter 9. ) The twin  controller is the oven’s tim e and tem perature contro l unit. The word “twin” does not m ean t hat the controller monitors th e heating ti me and tem perature of the two ovens sim ultaneously. Two ove ns can be connected to the controller, but the unit program s and operates only one of the ovens at a tim e. One advantage might be that a large capacity and a sm all capacity oven can be connected to a co ntroller, giving the option of running up an ove n appropriate for the size of the  load. After a case is burned out, the Ticomatic casting machine melts and casts metal uniformly, precisely, and automatically. 8.51.1.  Purpose  of  the  Burnout. The burnout elim inates the enti re pattern from  the m old and produces the required thermal expansion (1.0 percent). Refractory investments are compounded so the combined setting, hygroscopic, and thermal expansion is equal to the percentage contraction of solidifying m etal (1.7 percent)hygroscopic expansion accounts for  0.3 percent, and therm al expansion (heating the m old 1350 oF) accounts for 1.0 percent (for a total of 1.7 percent). 8.51.2. Procedures for Burnout With the Ticonium® Twin Controller. Schedule the burnout whenever possible after working hours. This sa ves time and eliminates the odor from  the burning wax and plastic during working hours. . F or exam ple, setting expansion accounts for 0.4 percent, 8.51.2.1. Ensure the twin controller is plugged in for proper operation of the timer. 8.51.2.2. Flip the selector switch on the twin controller to the oven you want to control. 8.51.2.3. Turn the temperature on the twin controller indicator setting to 1350 oF (733 oC). 8.51.2.4. Estimate the burnout time. Generally, wax will require a burnout time of 1 hour once the oven has reached high tem perature and plas tic pattern s will require 2 hours. The tim e a  mold spends at 1350  oF is ref erred to as the  heat-soak cycle. The tim e required to raise the temperature to 1350 oF will vary according to brand and model of oven. Ticonium supplies two types of burnout oven: 8.51.2.4.1. The Ticonium ® burnout oven,  which has a capacity of nine m olds. The heatup time is 2 to 3 hours from room temperature to 1350 oF. Then heat soak for 1 to 2 hours for a total burnout time of 3 to 5 hours. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  475 8.51.2.4.2. The Ticonium® super oven, which has a capacity of 20 m olds. Because this oven has such a large capacity, the suggested burnout time is 6 to 8 hours. 8.51.2.5. Control the burnout time as follows: 8.51.2.5.1. For manual operation, remove the trippers. Then use the “on-off” lever below the time dial. 8.51.2.5.2. For automatic cycling: 8.51.2.5.2.1. Set the tim e clock. Pull the tim e dial outward and rotate it until the correct time of day is in alignment with the pointer marked “time.” 8.51.2.5.2.2. Count back the required num ber of bur nout hours from  the actual tim e of day you intend to cast. T o set the silver “on”  tripper, loosen the knur led screw, slide the tripper around the edge of the  yellow dial to the tim e the heat cycle is  supposed to start, and tighten the knurled screw firm ly. For exam ple, if the intended casting tim e using a  super oven for the burnout is 8:00 a.m ., set  the “on” tripper for 12:00 a.m . (midnight). The black “off” tripper is provided as a safety precau tion. Set the “off” tripp er for a time after the casting run should be completed. This tripper turns the oven off automatically, if it is not turned off manually first. 8.51.2.5.2.3.  Using the skipper whe el besid e th e yellow tim e dial prevents autom atic burnout cycling for the day or days of the w eek is not required. Use the skipper wheel by placing skipping screws in the whe el for the da y (or days) the oven is to rem ain turned off. 8.51.2.5.3. Manually tu rn the twin  controller “on-off” lever to the “ocasting run to prolong equipment life. ff” position after a  8.51.2.6. Load the oven. The following considerations are important when loading the ovens: 8.51.2.6.1. Always face the sprue hole down so the wax can be more easily eliminated. 8.51.2.6.2. Use shrouds or plugs to raise the m olds off the oven floor at least 1 inch and to separate successive layers. Do  not allow the m olds to touch the oven walls, each other, or the therm ocouple protective sh ield. This will cause “cold  spots” which could result inuneven expansion. 8.51.2.6.3. Keep each mold in a plastic bag to retaessential because th e s team helps produce m ore uniform  heat saturation and m inimize investment cracking. 8.51.2.6.4. Stagger the top layer of  the m olds so the wax being elim inated from the sprue holes of the top layer drains between the molds on the bottom layer. 8.51.2.6.5. Periodically check the oven vent holes.incomplete burnout of the molds.  Clogged vents can be responsible for in m oisture. Moisture in the mold is  8.51.3. Casting Procedures. The Ticomatic® casting machine is a centrifugal machine designed to melt metals by using high frequency electric current produced in a water-cooled induction heating coil. The coil surrounds the crucible that holds the metal. The molten metal is fed into the mold by centrifugal force to prod uce the  casting. Because the m achine can  be operated over a wide rang e of temperatures, it can be used for casting gold alloy as well as chrome alloys. 8.51.3.1. To prepare the unit for casting: 476  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 8.51.3.1.1. Balance the casting arm. To do this, slide the counterweight on the casting arm to a position that balances  out the size of the m old you intend  to cast. All molds of the same  size will balance out at about th e same counterweight setting. It  is efficient practice to cast all molds of the sam e size together, reset th e counterweight, and continue on to a group of molds of another size. 8.51.3.1.2. Turn on the main power supply. 8.51.3.1.3. Turn on the water for those units conn ected to an external water source.  NOTE: For those T icomatic units connected to an ex ternal water source, a llow a m inimum of 15 minutes warmup time before using the machine. 8.51.3.1.4. Turn the “on-off” switch in the sensing head to the “on” position. 8.51.3.2. To raise the control arm  for positioning the high frequency  coil to the lo cked (left) position: 8.51.3.2.1. Rotate the casting arm until it is parallel with the front of the cabinet and with the counterweight end to the left. 8.51.3.2.2. Retract the slide carrying heating coil. 8.51.3.2.3. Touch the toe switch to unlock the contposition around the crucible. There is a two-second delay circuit built into the unit so you do not have to keep your toe pressed against the toe switch;  you m erely need to touch the switch. the crucible until the crucib le is directly over the rol arm and raise the heating coil to a 8.51.3.3. Before you start the first m elt, ensure the ye llow pilot light in th e sensing head is lit, the relay range knob is set properly, and the blue pilot light in the control console is lit. 8.51.3.4. Mount the flask on the casting arm as follows: 8.51.3.4.1. Make sure the swivel plate yoke assem bly is hooked in the correct slot for the length of flask to be cast. 8.51.3.4.2. Verify the setting of the counterweight. 8.51.3.4.3. Raise the locking arm handle until it hits the stop. 8.51.3.4.4. Insert the flask in the opening between th e swivel plate and the front plate. Make sure the seam faces away from  the operato r. Hold the face of the flask  firmly against the  front plate and line up the sprue hole with the op ening. Adjust the height of the flask so the sprue hole is above the center line of the opening and toward the operator (the 2-o’clock position on a clock face). 8.51.3.4.5. Slowly lower the locking arm handle until the swivel plate comes in contact with the rear su rface of the flask. W hen the swivel  plate seats itself and resistan ce to f urther closure increases, press down firmly to lock the flask in position. 8.51.3.5. Proceed with the casting as follows: 8.51.3.5.1. Place the correct ingot size in the crucible. 8.51.3.5.2. Press the “start” button on the control console.  NOTE: Because the con trol arm is in the “locked” position, the red pilot should light, indicating the coil cannot be released. 8.51.3.5.3. Move the control arm  as far right as  it goes and m aintain a slight upward lift on the handle as it m oves. NOTE: The green pilot should light, i ndicating the arm will release AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  477 when the correct casting temperature is reached. Without further attention from the operator, the sensing head will measure the tem perature and release the arm  at the correc t time. The control arm will drop and the arm will spin for 15 seconds, making the casting. 8.51.3.6. Prepare for the next casting as follows: 8.51.3.6.1. Raise and lock the casting arm (paragraph 8.51.3.2). 8.51.3.6.2. Remove the flask from the arm. 8.51.3.6.3. Remove the oxide from the crucible. 8.51.3.6.4. Proceed with the next melt. 8.51.3.7. Shut down the machine as follows: 8.51.3.7.1. Place dummy flask in position on arm. 8.51.3.7.2. Turn off the main power supply. 8.51.3.7.3. Turn off the water on the units attached to an external water source. 8.51.4.  Setting  the  Molds  Aside  To  Cool. A m old should be cool  enough to be handled in 30 minutes. Never quench a mold in water because it can cause serious warpage of the casting.  Section 8G—Finishing, Polishing, and Fitting the Framework 8.52. Freeing the Casting of Investment Debris. Follow Figure 8.133 and the following steps:  Figure 8.133. Freeing the Casting of Investment Debris.  8.52.1. Tap the sides of the m old lightly with a  plaster knife. The outer investm ent should fall away easily, exposing the paint-on layer and the main sprue button. 8.52.2. Grasp the button with pliers while tapping the pliers with a hammer. Most of the remaining investment should fall away from the casting. 8.52.3. Use a sandblaster to rem ove surface oxide. Hold the case several inches belo w the nozzle. (If a casting is held directly under the nozzle of the sandblaster, the high pressure stream of air and zircon grit could cause the casting to warp.) 478  8.53. Finishing and Polishing the Ticonium (Nickel-Chrome Alloy) Framework: AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 8.53.1. Introduction:  8.53.1.1.When the wax pattern for the fra mework is carefully for med, extensive grinding and shaping efforts are not n ecessary. The effectiveness of a finishing and  polishing effort depends on the speed of the lathe, hardness and shape of the abrasive particles, a mount of pressure applied, and physical qualities of the object being polished.  8.53.1.2. Finishing and polishing chrome alloys requires a high speed lathe (24,000 revolutions per m inute [rpm ]). Metal finishing and polishing  procedures should be done system atically, moving from coarse to progressively finer abrasi ves. After rem oving all  of the scratches from  the surface of the framework, use an exceedingly fine polishing agent to generate a h igh luster. Two rules that apply to most metal finishing procedures are to: speed of the lathe  do the cutting. Avoid using heavy 8.53.1.2.1. Let the abrasive and the pressure because it heats the work and could possibly warp th e casting. Heavy pressure also crushes abrasive particles, slows cutting, and causes the abrasive to clog and glaze. 8.53.1.2.2. Be certain each successive finishing  operation removes all scratches left by the preceding abrasive. 8.53.2. Rough-Finishing Procedures (Figure 8.134). Use a series of  wheels, discs, and mounted points in finishing the casting as follows:  Figure 8.134. Rough-Finishing the Casting.  8.53.2.1. Cut off the sprue with a separating disc (Figure 8.134-A). 8.53.2.2. Us e a heatless stone or a triple-m ounted  cutoff wheel to rem ove the bulk of metal where the sprue was attached. Contour the grossly ragged edges on the major connector (Figure  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  479 s been reduced or lost, use a #2 bur to 8.134-B). On palates where the stipple effect hareproduce the stipple by cutting in  a “fish scale”  pattern. With a #1 or 2 round bur, slightly  relieve the area under the rest shoulders. 8.53.2.3. Restore the casting to finished wax-up stat e. Use mounted points and barrel stones to remove any remaining flash on the casting (F igure 8.134-C). Remove any positive bubbles on the casting with an  appropriate size round bu r (2, 4, 6, or 8 rd).  CAUTION: Never stone the tissue side of a m axillary framework, stay away from the clasps,  and treat them  as a sep arate entity in the next step. 8.53.2.4. Shape up the top and bottom  of a clasp by  removing any flash or sharp edges that might exist due to sealing, ove rwaxing, or careless  investing (Figure 8.134-D). Use a sm all tapered stone to  delicately clean the inside of th e clasp only if necessary.  Do not grind off a significant amount of metal or the retention aspect of the clasp may be ruined. 8.53.3.  Ti-Lectro®  Polishing  (Figure  8.135). The Ti-Lectro procedure polishes chrom e alloy castings by an electrolytic deplating process.   Figure 8.135. Ti-Lectro® Polisher.  8.53.3.1. Sandblast the casting. Rinse the casting in clean water and dry it thoroughly. Abrasive grit and water con taminates Ti-Lectro® polishing solution. Do not to uch the casting with bare hands. Skin oil is also a contaminant. 8.53.3.2. Heat the solution with a Ti-Lectro® heater until the temperature reaches 120 to 140 oF. (A heated p an of  water can be substitu ted f or an elec tric heating dev ice.) For exc eptionally large castin gs and cas tings with  deeply vaulted palates, use  a som ewhat lower temperature solution for better results. If a pan of  heated water is used to  raise the bo wl of solution to the proper temperature, remove the bowl from the pan before continuing to the next step. 8.53.3.3. Attach a cathode “alligator” clip to a wire that originates from the negative (black) terminal of the Ti-Lectro polisher’s control box.  A heavier clip known as  the anode is attached to a rod, which in turn is m ounted on a black B akelite platform. The wire leading to the rod’s mounting can be traced back to the positive (red) terminal on the control box.  8.53.3.4. Place the bask et-like, cathode grid assem bly in the bowl. Attach the catho de clip to 480  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 the assembly’s terminal tab. Attach the anode clip to the casting.  8.53.3.5. Submerge the casting and the tip of the anode clip in the Ti-Lectro ® solution. The rod to which the anode clip is join ed can be adjusted up or down  so only the anode tip is in the solution. Always attach the anode  clip to the posterior portion  of palatal castings to prevent escaping gases from pocketing. Do  not allow the casting to touch  the cathode basket grid. Be certain the framework is completely submerged in the solution. 8.53.3.6. Switch on the control box and regulate it to the proper amperage. For each square inch of surface on both sides of a case, allow 2 amperes of electrical current. NOTE: For most cases, 6 to 8 amperes should be sufficient. 8.53.3.7. Set the time clock to 6 m inutes for average castings immersed in electrolytic solution at 120 to 140  oF. Large horseshoes and those cases with  deeply vaulted palates m ight require more time (8 minutes). Also, reverse the position of  these cases in the anode clip after half the polishing time elapses. Take the fram ework out of the solution and inspect it. If  the case is not bright enough, put it back in the solution for 2 more minutes. 8.53.3.8. After the case is polished, switch off the  control box. Re move the Bakelite platform with its associated anode assembly from the bowl. Release the casting into the bowl containing an acid neutralizing solution. (A neutralizing solution may be made by dissolving 2 tablespoons of sodium bicarbonate in approximately one quar t of water.) Dry the f ramework with an air  blast.  8.53.3.9. As soon as po ssible, rinse the anode clip because th e Ti-Lectro® solution attacks and corrodes it.  NOTE: The Ti-Lectro ® solution should be effective for up to 200 castings. Used solution is considered to be a hazardous waste and must be collected and disposed of according to local hazardous waste disposal procedures. 8.53.3.10. Some common problems associated with Ti-Lectro ® polish are as follows: ( NOTE: Be sure the wiring on the unit is properly connected and inspect the unit for corroded contacts.) 8.53.3.10.1. If the casting whitens, but does not shine, ask the following questions: 8.53.3.10.1.1. Is the solution too cold? Is it stirred? 8.53.3.10.1.2. Is the solution contaminated with grinding and sandblasting dust? 8.53.3.10.1.3. Is too short a time allowed? 8.53.3.10.1.4. Is the amperage too low? 8.53.3.10.2. If the casting shows etching, ask the following questions: 8.53.3.10.2.1. Is the solution too hot? Was it stirred? 8.53.3.10.2.2. Is the casting in the solution too long? 8.53.3.10.2.3. Is the amperage too high? 8.53.3.10.3. If the polish is uneven, ask the following questions: 8.53.3.10.3.1. Is the case centered in the cathode basket grid? 8.53.3.10.3.2. Is the casting properly sandblasted? 8.53.3.10.3.3. Is the framework rinsed after sandblasting? 8.53.3.10.3.4. Is there oil contamcompressed air jet? ination fr om  the technician’s hands or from a  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  8.53.3.10.3.5. Are the teeth on the anode clamp corroded away? 481 8.53.3.10.4. If the casting has turned dark yellow-brown, water is in the polishing solution. 8.53.3.10.5. If areas of the casting ha ve turned black, use a cool er solution. This is m ost likely to happen on cases with deeply recessed areas. 8.53.4. Fine-Finishing:  8.53.4.1. The objective of fine-finishi ng is to elim inate the gross scratch patterns left on the casting by preceding abrasives. Again, leave the tissue side of the palate alone. 8.53.4.2. Apply a rubber wheel to all ar eas of the casting that are acc essible. Use rubber points or fine rubber wheels to get to the rem aining areas (Figure 8.136-A and 8.136-B). Re member, rubber wheels and points can be  modified into convenient shap es by holding a truing stone against them.  Figure 8.136. Fine-Finishing.  8.53.4.3.

Testing the Initial Fit of a Casting on a Duplicate Master (Fitting) Cast:  8.53.5.1. Do not attem pt the initial seating of a fram ework on the m aster cast itself (paragraph 8.43). 8.53.5.2. Under m agnification and adequate lighting,  thoroughly inspect th e natural tooth and soft tissue side of the casting for nodules, bubbles , or any other im perfections. Devote special attention to rests, minor connectors leading to rests, and guiding plane surfaces in general. 8.53.5.3. Carefully remove the imperfections with the  finest bur or abrasive  device that can do the job. 8.53.5.4. If the casting still does not seat, apply dicasting that m ight be keeping it  from seating c ompletely. Repeat app lication of the disclosing pigment, trial se at the c asting and c arefully relieve the spots that show  up until the casting is seated. This process can take m any repetitions  and requires patience. D o not force the casting onto the cast.

The rests and rest seats should be in complete contact. If not, repeat application of th e disclosing pigm ent, trial seat the casting, and carefully relieve the spots that show up (as was done to fit the casting to the duplicate cast) until fit has been achieved.  NOTE: Som e dentists do not want the original m aster cast touched by the casting. Honor such a request. 8.53.7. Correcting Major Occlusal Discrepancies:  The onl y way denture teeth can be accurately8.53.7.1. Notice discrepancies caused by the fra mework that prevent opposing teeth from  coming into full maximum intercuspation. These discrepancies must be eliminated at this time. This emphasis is important because the occlusion is corrected again after the dentu re teeth are processed to the framework.  8.53.7.2. Why the duplication of effort? positioned on a fra mework is for that fram ework to properly occlude against oppo sing teeth first. The o bjective in this step is to resto re  the patient’s occlusal ve rtical dim ension and to eliminate gross and obvious interferences in lateral and protrusive excursions.  8.53.7.3. Most of the tim e, the assum ption is that  the dentist will elim inate any rem aining interference when the f ramework is tried in  the patient’s m outh. However, if the interferences are not eliminated before denture teeth are set and processed, the denture teeth will also prevent the natural teeth from coming into contact, magnifying the error.  8.53.7.4. Laboratory correction of a framework’s occlusion does not ordinarily involve using an adjustable articulator set to match the patient’s actual anatomical characteristics. It is likely that some form of si mple, fixed-guided instrument will be selected for the job. Articu lator choice depends on what the dentist orders and whethele (facebow transfer, lateral and protrusive jaw re lationship records). In many instances, opposing casts that show a reproducible maximum intercuspation occlusion are mounted in that position. In other situations, record base s and occlusion rim s might be n ecessary to relate the casts an d perform the mounting.  8.53.7.5. For cast-m ounting considerations and articulator adjustm ent procedures, see Chapter 6 (paragraphs 6.12 and 6.13) and Chapter 8 (paragraphs 8.40.2 and 8.40.3). 8.53.7.6. All castings do not requidenture might be an example. For cases requiring correction: 8.53.7.6.1. Remove the framework from the master cast. 8.53.7.6.2. Mount the m aster cast accord ing to the de ntist’s prescription. (If the dentist did  not want the casting tried on the master cast, use the duplicate master cast.) 8.53.7.6.3. Seat the framework on the master cast. 8.53.7.6.4. Restore the occlusal vertical dim ension. Do all grinding on the casting. Continue the pro cedure until the incis al gu ide pin m eets  the incisal guide table.  Most of th e “hig h spots” will appear on rests and m axillary lingual plates. Metal in stress-bearing areas in its final, polished condition has to be at leasinclude (1) areas where rests come over the marginal ridge, or (2) the minor connector of an embrasure clasp as it crosses the occlusal surface. Nonstress-bearing areas may be thinned to 0.5 mm.  re occlusion correction. An RPD opposing a comr approp riate patient records are availabplete t 1 mm thick for strength.

The point is, if the rest or lingual plate is to the mcomponents still rem ain, the only option is to  stop grinding. Relieve the opposing natural tooth until the other natural teeth touch and draw a circle with a red pencil around the area of the opposing tooth that was relieve d to alert the dentist. The de ntist has to m ake a choice  between thinning out the rest or lingual platopposing tooth. 8.53.7.6.6. Correct interferences in excursions. Eliminate working, balancing, and protrusive contacts between the metal of the casting a nd the opposing teeth in the posterior quadrants. Also, contact should not occur  between the casting and opposing  anterior teeth in working and protrusive excursions. If this contact is unavoidable, it should be m ade as light as possible. 8.53.7.6.7.

Disinfect and send the framework to the dentist for trial and adaptation in the patient’s mouth.  Section 8H—Fabricating, Processing, and Finishing an RPD Denture Base 8.54. Introduction to Resin Base Fabrication:  8.54.1. After the dentist receives the finished fram ework from the laboratory, the casting is seated and adapted in the patie nt’s mouth. All occlus ion interferences attributable to th e framework are eliminated. Before artificial teeth can be positio ned, mount the lower cast in proper relation to the upper cast.  8.54.2. Occlusion rims are not usually necessary in cases where enough natural teeth are present to locate a reproducible maximum intercuspation. The dentist may determine that occlusion rims are needed to relate the low er cast to the upper. The occlusion rim s are ordinarily attached directly to the framework (Figure 8.138). NOTE: A separating medium must be placed between the cast and the wax when m aking occlusion rim s on a fram ework. Adapt a layer of tinfoil to the edentulous area, seat the framework, and apply the molten wax for the occlusion rim. Be sure to take the f oil out before flasking the RPD.   Figure 8.138. Occlusion Rims.  8.54.3. The dentist m odifies the occlusion rim s, makes a ja w relationship record on the patient, and then sends the fram ework to the laboratory fo r addition of resin dentur e base and artificial teeth.

Plastic den ture teeth are alm ost universally chosen for attachm ent to RPD rete ntion g rids. As f ar as th e esth etic  problem is concerned, the  dentist tries to choose artificial teeth that b lend with the c olor and sh ape of remaining natural teeth. If so few natural teeth remain that the only infor mation they provide  is basic shade, tooth selection considerations are the same as those for com plete dentures. The 0-degree posterior teeth are ra rely used because the cusped tooth forms (20- and 30-degree posteriors) are easier to arrange against natural teeth. 8.55.3. Arrange Denture Teeth: 8.55.3.1. Procedures for Arrangement:  8.55.3.1.1. Adapt tinfoil to the edentulous areas of the cast under the fram ework retention grids. This step is not necessary if the dentist does not ask for a try in.

Set posterior teeth a little high (0.5 mm) in occlusion. Grind the occlusal surfaces to develop the best possible occlusion with  tee th in  the  op posing arch. This setting and subsequent alteration procedure is  done on a tooth-by-tooth basis.  NOTE:  Remember, do not set den ture te eth on  a m axillary tuberos ity or a m andibular r etromolar pad. W hen all artificial teeth are set and adjusted, the incisal guide pin must touch the incisal guide table. 8.55.3.2. Denture Tooth Alignment and Occlusion Considerations: 8.55.3.2.1.  Anterior  Teeth. From  an alignm ent point of vi ew, artif icial ante rior te eth ar e supposed to blend with the remaining natural teeth. Denture teeth may be ground in any way to achieve that goal, short of grossly weakening or disfiguring them as follows: 8.55.3.2.1.1.  RPD  With  an  Anterior  Toothborne  Portion. Artif icial an terior teeth  should not be subjected to working excursion contact. If working side contact is 486  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  d not bear the full load of a protrusive unavoidable, it should be distributed am ong  as m any artificial and natural teeth aspossible. A n isolated artificial tooth shoulexcursion because it cannot stand s uch abuse for long. It will probab ly break out of the supporting denture base. 8.55.3.2.1.2. RPD With an Anterior Extension Portion. Arrange artificial anterior teeth to balance with the working ex cursions of the rem aining natural anterior and posterior teeth. Protrusive balance is also desirable in these situations. It tends to minimize anterior tipping forces and anterior residual ridge resorption. However, achieving protrusive  balance can generate esthetic problem s such  as incorrect alignm ent or shorten ing of artificial anterior teeth. When  making a choice between esthe tics and protrusive balance, the tendency is to  favor esth etic v alues b ecause they  usu ally represent the dom inant consideration in anterior areas. 8.55.3.2.2. Posterior Teeth: 8.55.3.2.2.1.  In  Maximum  Intercuspation  (MI). The m aximum number of contacts must be developed between upper and lower posterior teeth bilaterally. 8.55.3.2.2.2. In Lateral Excursions:  8.55.3.2.2.2.1. It is recommended that  natural teeth should bear  most of the contact load in a working excursion. The posterior teeth of an RPD should be po sitioned and shaped to avoid working and balancing co ntact with teeth in the opposing arch. For this recommendation to work well, the case must show at least some anterior guidance (adequate vertical overlap with almost no horizontal overlap between upper and lower natural anterior teeth). In cases with little or no anterior guidance, the occlusal surfaces of posterior denture teeth m ight have to be ground off subs tantially to conform to the recommendation.  8.55.3.2.2.2.2. In the previous paragraph,  notice the use of the word  recommendation, as opposed to a word like rections. There are situations where  balanced When in doubt, check the dentist’s diocclusion between the RPD and the teeth of the  opposing arch might be the occlusion scheme of choice (for exam ple, long, bila teral distal extensions, a com bination anterior and posterior extension case, complete denture).

There are m any schools of thought on this subject. and the RPD opposes a 8.55.3.2.2.3.  In  Protrusive  Excursions. Except for an RPD that involves an anterior extension or an RPD that opposes a com plete denture, straightforward protrusive balance is not desirable. 8.55.4. Wax Up the RPD. The principles followed for waxing up an RPD are similar to those that apply to waxing complete dentures (Chapter 7, Section 7R). A few differences are as follows: 8.55.4.1. Wax-Up for Try-In:  8.55.4.1.1. The assumption is that the dentist might mar the wax-up by making alterations in the denture tooth position. With a basic, uncharacterized wax up for try-in, gingival areas are waxed and carved the sam e as complete dentures. The borders of th e flanges should extend to the blue pencil outline placed on the cast by th e dentist at the time the design was drawn. In distal ex tension cas es, the dentu re base sho uld cover th e m axillary tuberos ity a nd the mandibular retromolar pads.  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  487 8.55.4.1.2. One of the places where the resin base joins with the framework is at an external finish line. The contour of the resin base m ust s moothly transition into the contour of a framework across a fin ish line. W hile the wax tr y-in is in p rogress, all changes th e dentist requests should be made. 8.55.4.2. Final Wax-Up:  returns the case to the laboratory for8.55.4.2.1.

Fully seat the fram ework and the wax ba se on the cast in the  articulator. Double check to be sure the fram ework is fully seated and no wax or debris has gotten betw een the framework and the cast.  8.55.4.2.3. With the artificial teeth in proper ma ximum intercuspation against the opposing arch, seal the wax base to the cast. Perform a fully characterized wax-up that blends with the patient’s gingival and alveolar mucosal features (Figure 8.140).  Figure 8.140. Denture Teeth Set and Denture Bases Waxed.  8.55.4.2.4. Remove wax from clasp arms so they do not become embedded in plastic during the packing and processing procedure. Extend a lines to allow for finishing the resin back to a smooth transition between the metal and resin. Also extend the borders of the flanges slig htly beyond the blue pencil ou tline drawn on the cast. The ov erextension allows for loss of re sin material during fini shing and polishing the processed denture base.  8.55.4.2.5. Extend the wax into the sulcus rolls if there is no guiding blue line.

Flasking an RPD is similar to flasking a complete denture (Chapter 7, Sec tion 7S), but the framework is held in position on the cast in the lower half of the flask during the entire boilout , packing, and processing procedure. Use a method of this kind to m aintain the cor rect relationship of the fra mework to the cast. A disadvantage of this method is that the presence of the fram ework complicates applying the separating m edium after the boilout but before the packing. The following procedures are used: 488  Figure 8.141. Flasking, Packing, and Processing RPD Bases. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  half of the flask. Trim the 8.56.1.1. Fit the cast into the lower cast to adequate ly clear the flask’s walls. Soak the cast in saturated SDS for about 15 minutes. Apply a separating medium, such as liquid soap, to the base of the cast to  protect the integrity of  any keying grooves tha t might be present. 8.56.1.2. Half-flask the case (Figure 8.141-A) by cove ring the tops of a ny stone teeth present on the cast. Also cover all clasp s, bars, and m etal plates. Do not  cover the denture teeth or the wax-up. W hen the dental stone sets,separating medium (liquid soap) to all exposed dental stone surfaces. 8.56.1.3. Use the stone cap method to full-flask the case. Let the  dental stone set for at least an hour (Figure 8.141-B). 8.56.1.4. Place the flask in boiling water for about 4 1/2 minutes to soften the wax denture base (Figure 8.141-C). From the boiling water, rem ove the flask, open it, and  eliminate all the wax from the mold. Use the sam e m ethod (wax bo ilout) for rem oving the wax from com plete dentures. 8.56.1.5. Apply a tinfoil substitute:  contour  the surface so there are no undercuts. Apply a 8.56.1.5.1. The presence of tinfoil or a tinfoil substitute on cast and mold surfaces during  acrylic resin processing is just  as necessary for an RPD as it  is for complete dentures. If a separating m edium is not app lied, the  proce ssed dentu re will b e cov ered with a  crus t of  acrylic resin mixed with stone particles.  8.56.1.5.2. Two coats o f tinfoil sub stitute are p ainted over all mold surfaces. Avoid getting  tinfoil sub stitute on the  ridge laps of  the dentu re te eth. Be  sure to p aint the den ture base  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  489 areas of the cast. W ork the tinf oil substitute under the retention grids. Do not use so  much that there is a heavy, obvious fluid buildup. T his is a  step where the advantages of open ladder retention as opposed to m esh are quickly  appreciated. It is m uch easier to get under the open f orm of  reten tion gr ids. Caref ully r inse any ex cess tinf oil substitute f rom the retention grid. 8.56.2. Mixing, Packing, and Processing the Acrylic Resin (Figure 8.141-D):  8.56.2.1. Follow the m anufacturer’s directions for m onomer-polymer proportions and determine the proper packing consistency (early  dough or “snap” stage) . Handle acrylic resin with gloved hands to prevent contamination.  8.56.2.2. After the resin  has reached packing cons istency, press som e of the m ass around th e denture teeth until the u pper half of the m old is about half full. Then work another portion of  the acrylic resin under and around the retention grid s until the lower half of  the mold is also partly filled. Use enough material to ensure overpacking on the first closure of the mold.  8.56.2.3. Place one or two sheets of separating film between the upper an d lower halves of the flask. Place the two flask halves togethe r ca refully. Follow the sam e tr ial pack ing r itual previously outlined for complete dentures. (Two or three trial packs are usually required before metal to m etal contact of the f lask halves is achieved.) Use fresh sheets of separating film for each successive opening and closing.  8.56.2.4. When com pleting the trial packing, moiste n the surfaces of the acrylic in the upper and lower molds with monom er. Discard the separator sheet, close th e flask, and process the case in the same manner as complete dentures are processed. 8.57. Finishing the RPD: 8.57.1. Deflasking the RPD. Use the ejector press to separate  the RPD mold from the flask. Saw through the outer walls of  the mold and pry the sectioned p ieces away from the cast and the RPD (Figure 8.141-E). Avoid lifting or ot herwise displacing the R PD from the cast. Pick off the gross do  not  shellblast  the  case. Shellb lasting debris and clean the dentur e teeth with a brush, but inevitably lifts the resin base  away from the cast and ruins the  opportunity for reestablishing the occlusion of the RPD at this time. 8.57.2. Remounting the RPD. Reposition the stone casts on the original plaster mountings, using the indexing keys that were cu t into the cast. Remount the defl asked RPD and the opposing cast on the articulator so processing errors can be corrected. 8.57.3.  Selective  Grinding  the  RPD  (Figure  8.142). W hen selectively grinding an RPD case, only artificial teeth can be alte red. Modify the directions given  for selectively grinding complete dentures to conform to the following: 8.57.3.1.  Reestablish  the  Occlusal  Vertical  Dimension. Bring th e incis al gu ide pin into contact with the incisal guide table. 8.57.3.2. Adjust the Eccentric Excursions. There should have been a  plan for eccentric tooth relationships when the artificial te eth were in itially arranged (anter ior guidance, unilateral balance, and bilateral balance). Grind the artificial teeth to conform to that original plan. 8.57.4. Recovering the RPD From the Cast. With a bur or a sharp knife, cut through the stone tooth under each clasp to reliev e the clasp of all  strain during the reco very process. After each clasp has been freed, carefully saw into the base of the cast in the same manner as for the recovery of a complete denture. Insert a p laster knife into the saw cu ts and gently fracture the cut sections . 490  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 Do not apply force to the clasps or connectors taking care not to distort the clasp arms, take the stone teeth out of the clasp assemblies.  while the sections are being rem oved. Finally, Figure 8.142. Restoring Occlusal Vertical Dimension.  8.57.5. Finishing the RPD. Fit an arbor band on a lathe and remove the flash of acrylic resin from the dentu re border. If th ere is any doubt about a border ex tension, leav e it long un til a d entist indicates otherwise. Use a sharp pick to rem ove any flash or stone from around the necks of the teeth. Finish the areas around the clasp assemblies and finish lines with special care so the parts of the fram ework are not m arred, weakened, or distor ted. Use burs, sandpaper disks, or abrasive strips that are specifically m ade for the purpose of freeing the arms of the clasps from the denture base material so their flexibility is not impaired (Figure 8.143).  Figure 8.143. Completed RPDs.   AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  8.57.6.  Polishing  the  RPD. Polishing RPDs is sim ilar to  polis hing a com plete denture, but is significantly more hazardous. There is danger that  the RPD could be d amaged. Wear protective eyeglasses. Cover the clasp tips with the fingers. Do not allow the arms of the clasps or other RPD projections to become entangled in the revolving brushes or wheels. Make certain the brush or rag wheel is spinning with the direction a clasp arm is taking. Produce a final, high luster on the resin and metal parts of the RPD. Clean off the polis hing compounds and disinfect the prosthesis. Place the case in a sealable plastic bag that contains a cotton roll moistened with a few drops of water. 8.58.  Veneering  an  RPD  Framework  With  Resin.  The substructure design characteristics for resin veneers are described in paragraph 8.46.3. Following are the procedures  for applying composite resin to a completed RPD framework: 491 8.58.1. Applying a Bonding Agent. Some composite resin systems use a chemical bonding agent that is applied to the metal substructure to strengthen the bond between th e metal and the resin. This is usually accom plished by bl asting a ch emical coating to the m etal that allows a chem ical bond between the metal substructure and the resin veneer (Figure 8.144-A).  8.58.2. Applying and Processing the Opaque:  8.58.2.1. The area to receive the veneer m ust be clean of all dirt, oil and debris. Seal any areas of the cast where the resin material may overlap onto the stone. 8.58.2.2. Select the opaque for the desired shade  and shake the bottle well. The opaque should have a creamy consistency. W ith a small sable brush, apply several thin , even coats of opaque to the casting (Figure 8.144-B). Allow each layer  to dry  at room  temperature for about 15 minutes. Close the bottle tightly afevaporates easily.  8.58.2.3. Recheck the opaque area for com plete coverage.

When the buildup is com pleted, remove the fram ework from the cast and place th e RPD into the curing unit (Figure 8.144-G). Close the lid and activate th e machine. Complete processing in the curing unit ta kes about 15 m inutes. If the ven eer will be m ore than 11 mm thick, process it in increm ents in the curing uni t as the th ickness of each layer approaches 11 mm.  8.58.3.5. After processing, the veneer m ay be shaped and contoured with stones, burs or disks (Figure 8.144-H and -I).  Carefully trim  around t he edges of the veneer to blend the resin in to the contours of the metal. After the veneer is cleaned of any dust and debris, it may be polished the same as any resin (Figure 8.144-J). AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Section 8I—Altered Cast Technique for Fabricating Distal Extension RPD Bases  8.59. Introduction. An altered (or corrected cast) is a master cast for an RPD framework that has had its tissue areas modified by a secondary im pression (Figure 8.145). After a m aster cast is m ade with the usual single impression, a dentist m ight choose to m ake another “corrected” or “functional” im pression in a case that involves unilateral orcorrected im pression is used to modify or alter distal extension areas on the master cast. The dentist makes the corrected impression and alters the master cast after confirming the framework fits in the patient’s mouth and before arranging the artificial teeth. The procedure is designed to ensureextension denture base.  the best possible soft tissue support for a distal 493  bilateral distal extensions. The 8.59.1.  Fabricating  the  Custom  Tray  Fabrication. To produce a corrected impression, the dentist needs a custom tray constructed over the framework’s distal extension retention grid. After he or she fits and adjusts the fram ework, the den tist returns the framework with a n outline of  a proposed impression tray on the master cast. The steps in making this tray are: 8.59.1.1. Block out large undercuts with baseplate wax. 8.59.1.2. Seat the framework on the master cast. Be sure the rests are fully  seated. Seated rests are the best indicators that the entire framework is in place. onsistency. Adapt the m aterial over the 8.59.1.3. Mix self-curing resin to a dough-like cedentulous areas  to form  a tray th at is firm ly  attached to the r etention grids.  Af ter th e r esin polymerizes, lift the fram ework with the attach ed tray from  the cast (Figure 8.145-A through   -E). 8.59.1.4. Trim the custom tray to the outline on the master cast. Trim away resin from the tissue side of the tray until it is alm ost even with the retention grid (Figure 8. 145-F). This will g ive room for the impression material. Smooth any sharp edges of the tray and return the tray to the  dentist. 8.59.2. Making the Corrected Impression. The dentist will make the corrected impression. He or she places an impression material of choice in the tray and the entire assembly (framework and all) is fully seated in the patient’s mouth. The impression is then sent to the laboratory. 8.59.3. Altering the Master Cast. A corrected im pression may have been m ade from any of a  number of impression materials subject to varying amounts of distortion from different influences. For example, impression wax is easily distorted by h eat or pressure. Zinc oxide eugenol is brittle  and fragile; rubber base can dist ort relatively quickly over tim e;  and polyvinylsiloxane is very stable, but m ay not adhere well to the cus tom tray. Handle the im pression accordingly. Alter th e cast to accept the new impression following these steps: extension tissue area 8.59.3.1. Use a spiral saw blade to cut across the di stal extension, from buccal to ling ual, on a line that passes 1 mm behind the distal abutm ent. Through the cast, make another cut that is parallel and lingual to the lingual su lcus to join anteriorly with the first cut. These two cuts are made to remove the distal (Figure 8.145-G). W ith the spiral saw or crosscut fissure bur, place m ultiple dovetails in th e cut surface of the cast  to form m echanical retention for the corrected addition (Figure 8.145-H). 8.59.3.2. Check to m ake sure there is no i mpression m aterial on the tissue surface of rests, minor connectors, or major connectors. Place the framework and corrected im pression on the prepared master cast. Check to see if any of the impression material touches the master cast. If it does, either the cast or the impression must be trimmed. It is usually best to trim the cast, but check with the den tist if there is a doubt. Ideally, there should be  1 to 2 mm  bet ween the 494  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 impression m aterial an d the cast.respective seats. Secure the metal framework to the dry master cast with sticky wax.   Be certain  a ll res ts a re in com plete contact with their Figure 8.145. Corrected Cast Technique.  8.59.3.3. Around the borders of the im pression, adapt a  beading of utility wax the sam e as it  was adapted for a com plete denture. Box the impr ession and the cast to  confine the flow of dental stone (Figure 8.145-I). Soak the base of  the cast for about 5 m inutes. Make sure the cut edges of the cast are moist so they do not absorb water from the new mix of stone. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  495 8.59.3.4. Prepare a m ix of vacuum  spatulated st one, place the boxed assem bly on a vibrator, and gently vibrate the stone in to the impression and retention  cuts of the cast (F igure 8.145-J). Check to be sure the framework is still seated properly on the master cast. 8.59.3.5. After the stone sets, rem ove th e boxing m aterial (Figure 8.145-K).  NOTE: So me dentists m ake a jaw relationship record right impression sets. If a jaw relationship record is present, pour the altered cast, rough trim and key the cast, and m ount the altered and opposing cast s before m aking any attem pt to rem ove the framework and tray from the altered cast. 8.59.3.6. Place th e altered cast  in a warm  bath (135  oF) to soften the corrective impression  material. Remove the f ramework and tr ay of f the cas t. Completely clean all d ebris f rom the altered cast (Figure 8.145-L). on top of t he plastic tray after the corrected 8.59.4.  Preparing  To  Mount  the  Altered  Cast. Trim , key, and m ount the cast if this has not already been done. 8.59.5. Removing the Acrylic Resin Tray. Flame the acry lic resin tray u ntil it sof tens. Peel the tray off the framework. Wait until the framework cools to clean it thoroughly. 8.59.6. Repositioning the Framework. Seat the framework on the cast with all the rests in place. The retention grid’s tissue stop m ay not touch the altered cast.  Important: To compensate for this discrepancy, place a drop of autopolym erizing resin between the stop and  the cast to take up the space. This prevents framework distortion when packing the denture base material.  Section 8J—Interim RPDs 8.60. Introduction. These prostheses were formerly called “temporary” RPDs. The word interim means “a period of time in between events.” Before a conventional RPD is constructed, extraction sites must be well healed. Also, to replace an RPD that is broken, or one that no longer fits, may take a while. An interim RPD is a quick , inexpensive substitute for replacing the missing natural teeth. An interim RPD may be ma de with autopolym erizing, heat-processed, or light -cured acrylic with plastic denture teeth attached (Figure 8.146). W rought wire clasps are frequen tly used to help retain the prosthesis in themouth.  8.61. Interim RPD Procedures:    if denture teeth are to8.61.1. The dentist draws a design on the casts and sends the casts to the laboratory. 8.61.2. It m aybe necessary to relieve the cast be butted against the edentulous ridge without the use of a facial flange (paragraph 8.46.1.2.1). Check with the dentist. 8.61.3. Bilaterally opposing unde rcuts on natural teeth and softundercuts that are not blocked out be fore prosthesis fabrication can  interfere with its placement in the patient’s mouth. Survey the cast at a neutral (0 degree) tilt and mark the heights of contour on the remaining natural teeth (Figure 8.146-A). Also,  mark the facial and li ngual soft tissue heights of contour. Perform a 0-degree blockout of lingual  and proximal tooth undercuts and flash a sm all amount of wax in the gingival  crevices (Figure 8.146-B). Block  out lingual soft  tissue undercuts on mandibular casts. Carve the wa x back 1 mm gingival to the su rvey line of each tooth. Round off any blockout wax ledges that might have been created. 8.61.4. Duplicate the cast, using the following steps (Figure 8.146-C):  tissue vary in depth. Deep 8.61.4.1. Stand the cast on end in SDS for about 1/2 hour. 496  Figure 8.146. Interim RPD Construction. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  8.61.4.2. Place the cast in a duplicating flask. Use re versible hydrocolloid or alginate as the duplicating material. If alginate  is chosen, m easure 2 to 3 tim es more water than the a mount recommended for standard water-to-powder proportions to obtain a conveniently runny mix. 8.61.4.3. Pour the duplicate cast in vacuum spatulated dental stone. 8.61.5. Mount the cast against its opposing cast on a simple articulator. 8.61.6. Adapt plastic denture teeth to the duplicate  cast (Figure 8.146-D). Grind the denture teeth to fit the edentulous spaces. Use the opposing cast for positional reference and construct a suitable matrix to record the placement of the teeth (Figure 8.146-E). 8.61.7. Bend the wrought wire clasps (Figure 8.146-F). The most commonly used wire clasp forms for interim  RPD are the C, the Ada whichever clasps are requested, being certain to in corporate an adequate terminal bend or loop for mechanical retention in the acrylic resin denture base. 8.61.8. Relate the teeth and clasps to the duplicate cast. Paint the duplicat e cast with tinfoil substitute. Use the matrix to reposition the denture teeth. Use sticky wax to attach the  teeth to the matrix. Orient the wrought wire clasps in their proper positions. Be  sure they do not interfere with ms, and th e ball (Chapter 9, paragraph 9.16.2). AdaptAFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  497 the teeth or matrix. Fasten the clasps to the cast by applying sticky  wax to the clasps on the facial surfaces of the abutments. Keep the wax from the denture-bearing areas.  8.61.9. Sprinkle autopolym erizing resi n to form  the denture base  portion of the interim  RP D (Figure 8.146-G and -H). The denture base should be 2 to 3 mm thick to minimize finishing. Place the assembly in a pressure pot under water at 110  oF, 20 psi for 10 m inutes. (Alternately, the base may be processed using heat cured or light cured resin.) 8.61.10. Finish and polish the interim RPD. Lift it off the duplicate cast with a controlled jet of air. Finish it to conform to the dentist’s outlin e. The finished denture base s hould be 2 to 3 mm thick. Polish the RPD. Try it onto th e master  cas t to  ensu re it f its prop erly a nd goes to place easily (Figure 8.1 46-I).

NOTE:  It is possible to perform   all of the procedures on th e blocked out m aster cast  without ever making a duplicate.  Section 8K—Performing an RPD Reline 8.62. Relining an RPD Resin Base. One convenient, satisfactory way of performing an RPD reline is to use autopolymerizing resin and a duplicating jig (Jectron, Hooper) as follows: 8.62.1. Relieve all undercuts on the tissue surfaces of the resin base  areas to be relined. Grind enough old resin out to m ake room  for a layer of im pression m aterial. Disinfect the RPD and return it to the dentist.  NOTE: The dentist makes an impression in the patient’s m outh, using the relieved denture base as the tray. The im pression material sets while the f ramework is se ated on the abutment teeth. 8.62.2. Box and pour the im pression  site only. Do not rem ove the resultant cast from  the impression site until after the cast is mounted in the jig (Chapter 7, paragraph 7.182). 8.62.3. Make a stone patty on the bottom  half of the  duplicating jig. Float the occlusal and incisal aspect of the RPD into the patty. Sink enough of th e denture teeth and m ajor connector to form a  perfectly reliable index. Do not si nk the fram ework so far th at its  delicate parts are b uried in the stone. The RPD must come out of the index without significant difficulty. 8.62.4. Moisten the base of the minicast poured in the sectional impression. Attach the minicast to the upper half of the jig. Be sure the top and bottom halves of the jig m eet in m etal-to-metal contact. 8.62.5. Proceed as with a complete denture reline (Chapter, 7 paragraph 7.182).  Section 8L—Review of the Swing-Lock System 8.63.  Prefabricated  Hinge  and  Lock  System.  There are ora l con ditions for which RPDs with conventional clasps are inadvisable.  Swing-Lock is the comm ercial name for a prefabricated hin ge and lock system that can be substituted for clasps in an RPD framework.  8.63.1. A Swing-Lock RPD consists of labial and li ngual sections. The labial  part is hinged and locked to the lingual portion around the rem aining teeth in the arch. The com pleted labial section can be all metal struts, a cosmetic gingival veneer or a combination of the two.  8.63.2. A Swing-Lock RPD may be indicated for the following reasons; (1) in the use of minimal, mobile, tilted, irregular, or splinting of  m obile tee th, (3)  in  th e cosm etic re placement of  lost gin gival tissues ; and  (4)  f or restoring cleft palates, post surgical, and accident cases.  otherwise questionable teeth as abutments for RPD; (2) for the AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 8.63.3. The Swing-Lock attachments (Figure 8.147), hinge (A), hinge positioner (B), and lock (C) come from  the com pany as p lastic patterns  th at  are then cast in the dentist’s alloy of  choic e (Ticonium, Type IV Gold). After casting, the  metal parts are position ed in the RPD fra mework wax-up, the rest of the fram ework (labial and li ngual sections) is castattachments become embedded in the metal.  , and the Swing-Lock  Figure 8.147. Plastic Patterns and Resultant Castings. 498   8.63.4. The first thought is that the fram ework casting will completely fuse the Swing-Lock parts and that nothing on tha t RPD will ever hinge  and lock. However, the hinge and lock develop  a natural oxide coating before the framework is cast. The molten metal for the frame casting hits the Swing-Lock parts and in timately molds to them. However, the oxide coating prevents the m olten metal from directly uniting with them. The result is a precision hinge and lock mechanism. 8.63.5. In the interests of familiarity, a review of the techn ique is presented in Figure 8.148. This technique is just another way the dentist can treat certain oral conditions.   Section 8M—RPD Repairs 8.64. Overview: 8.64.1. The repair of or addition to  an RPD is a very comm on laboratory request. Most repairs are not difficult; yet they require ingenuity, precision, and thoroughness to ensure long-term success.  8.64.2. For all bu t the s implest repairs, a s tone matrix is required to po sition parts correctly  so a proper fit in the mouth can occur. Sometimes for a fractured denture base or resin tooth, parts can be temporarily attached with sticky wax and then a matrix formed to align parts for the repair.  8.64.3. Quite often the dentist must do a pickup impression with the RPD in the m outh to produce a master cast or m atrix. Because th e prosthesis remains in the im pression when poured, critical areas, such as undercuts and clas ps, should be adequately blocke d out with soft wax to allow removal of the RPD from the master cast without damage to the cast or RPD.  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 8.148. Swing-Lock RPD Fabrication. 499   500  8.64.4. After disinfection and bloc kout, the pickup im pression should be poured immediately in  stone or plaster. If a soldering procedure is needed, it should be done on a duplicate refractory cast and the original cast used for final fitting and finishing. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 8.65. Repair and Addition to Denture Bases: type of repair are sim ilar to those for a 8.65.1. The laboratory procedures involved for this complete denture. 8.65.2. Pieces are approxim ated and a m atrix for med as previously described. After the stone matrix has reached its final set, the denture bas e fragments can be rem oved and the fractu re line prepared. The fracture site should be exam ined to help determine the cause of failure, if possible, to avoid a repeat fracture. If th e thickness of resin is less tha n 2 mm, the area should be trimm ed back to provide bulk (thickness) for the repaired section. Edges  of old resin should be prepared on  each side of the repair line in the s ame manner  as a com plete denture repair (Chapter 7, Sectio n 7AH). 8.65.3. Coat the matrix with tinfoil substitute and allow to dry. The fragments of the RPD base are then secured in position with sticky wax, and th e repair is accom plished using autopolym erizing acrylic resin. The rep air area should  be overbuilt  to allow for finish ing. Place the p rosthesis in a pressure pot containing warm water (110  oF) at 15 psi for 10 m inutes for polymerization to occur. After the resin has fully set, fi nish and polish the repair.8.65.4. Th e extension of a denture base section is done in a very sim ilar manner as desc ribed above, except the dentist must provide f or the new area to be covered. The R PD may be  extended with a com pound or polysulfide rubber  base or addition silicone im pression as it is positi oned in the mouth and then “picked-up” with an overlying alginate impression to allow pouring of a master cast for the addition. 8.65.4. The extension of a denture bain a very similar  manner as described above, except the dentist m ust provide for the ne w area to be covered. The RPD m ay be extended with a compound or polysulfide rub ber base or  addition silicone impression as it is position ed in the m outh and then “picked-up”  with an overlying alginate im pression to allow pouring of a master cast for the addition. 8.66. Resin Retention Repairs: se section is done t 1 mm resin bulk at the junction. T8.66.1. Where resin on a RPD joins to a polish ed metal surface, a finish lin e (or groove) in th e metal should be created to allow for at leashe bulk resin decreases th e tend ency for fluids to  seep  in to the gap betw een the m etal and the resin causing  discoloration and a space for m icroorganism growth. It is important to offset internal and external finish lines (that is, not directly overlying each other) to prevent overthinning of the metal (Figure 8.149). 8.66.2. Most resin (and tooth) additions can be attached chem ically and m echanically to the adjoining old denture base. At tim es, mesh fragments from scrapped frameworks or wrought wire loops must be added to the framework by soldering to provide a surface for addition of a new part. Also, where little or no contact area is available for connecting new resin to old, 1 to 2 mm slots or holes can b e made in the m etal of the m ajor connector to allow for mechan ical retention of the  added resin or denture tooth (F igure 8.150). Regardless, m echanical retention is essential for a  successful addition. 8.67. Repairing Broken Artificial Teeth: 8.67.1. Denture Teeth on a Resin Base. Prepare the fracture site as you would for a com plete denture tooth repair (C hapter 7, p aragraph 7.1 74.3). Select, adapt,  an d attach a replacem ent AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  501 tooth in a similar manner. If the old tooth is relatively intact, but just displaced from the denture base, it can be repositioned and reattached with autopolymerizing resin for a very simple repair. Mechanical retention in  the resin tooth and denture base should be made in the f orm of a  diatoric, dovetail, or grooves to optim ize the stre ngth of the repair because denture base resin does not fully bond to plastic denture teeth. A cast of the opposing dentit ion helps refine the occlusion.  Figure 8.149. Finish Line Cut Into an RPD Framework.  Figure 8.150. Retention Added to an RPD.  8.67.2. Reinforced Acrylic Pontic (RAP) Repair: 8.67.2.1. An alginate pickup im pression of the RPD is usually need ed for this repair. After  disinfection, the impression should be adequately blocked out and poured in stone. 8.67.2.2. A new denture tooth is adapted to the RAP site, using the adjacent and opposing teeth as a guide, and luted in p lace with sticky wax on its lingual surface. A light coat of separator is placed on the adjacent stone teeth, and a facial p laster matrix is made. When the matrix is fully set, the too th is removed and attach ed to the f acial matrix with sticky wax on its incisa l edge. The m aster cast is ca refully coated with tinf oil  substitute, and the denture tooth is attached using tooth colored autopolym erizing resin while  being held in p lace with the  f acial matrix. The repair is placed in a pressu re pot containing warm water (110  oF) at 15 psi for 10 m inutes. Then it is finished and polished. 8.67.3. Prefabricated “Channel and Post” Facings: 8.67.3.1. Use a high-sp eed diam ond bur to drill outcement from the repair site. 8.67.3.2. Choose a replacement facing of proper shade and size. Adapt the facing to its backing  fragments of the facing and clean the 502  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 on the framework. If it is obvious th at a great deal of m odification needs to be done, rub a #2 pencil lead across the metal backing of the framework. Slide the facing down the post. An area requiring grinding will show up on the facing as a mark. 8.67.3.3. After adapting as well as possible, give th e facing and fram ework to the dentist for final adjustments and cementation. 8.67.4. Repairing Braided Post Posterior Teeth:   out residue fragm ents around  the braided post to allow  8.67.4.1. Use a bur to carefully drillroom for replacement tooth. 8.67.4.2. Select a replacement acrylic resin denture tooth of proper shade and mold. 8.67.4.3. Take the tooth and drill a hole of a lesupporting post. 8.67.4.4. Rub a #2 pencil lead on the post and m etal seat for the tooth. Make the tooth confor m to the seat by grinding the black marks that transfer over to the tooth. 8.67.4.5. Use self-curing, tooth-colored acrylic resin to attach the tooth in place. ngth and diam eter that accommodates the 8.68. Addition of Artificial Teeth: 8.68.1. Adding a tooth to an RPD is sim ilar to replacing a broken resin toot h. An alginate pickup  impression of the prosthesis is needed for a master cast fo r the proced ure. A replacem ent resin tooth of proper shade and size is selected, ideally comparable to the tooth that was extracted or the contralateral tooth in the same arch.  8.68.2. Carefully adapt the tooth, as needed, and fabricate a facial or occlus al plaster m atrix to hold the tooth in position for luting with autopolym erizing denture resin. The m arginal ridges of  the added tooth (or teeth) shou ld b e even with  the ad jacent tooth  and the facial profile should  follow the curvatu re o f the arch. Do not plaalalignment by attempting to make occlusal contacts.  8.68.3. When possible, the dental ar ch should be relatively symmetr ical, and the contours created should be smooth with even transitions. Uneven c ontours or gross variati ons from the occlusal  plane decrease patient comfort and a daptation. Before attaching the new tooth, be sure to provide mechanical retention in the form of slots or dovetails in the adjacent metal, denture base resin, and each added tooth. ce a resin tooth in excessive m8.69. Repairing Metal Framework Fractures and Distortions: 8.69.1. Metal frameworks display many kinds of fract ures and distortions.  Electric soldering may repair some if the fragments are big enough or the damage is not in a highly flexible area.  8.69.2. Some of the m ore comm on problem s repair able by electric sold ering are (1) m inor connector leading to a clasp or auxiliary rest fractures, (2) distal extension grid fatigues and breaks off at the junction with the m ajor connector, or  (3) palatal strap or a lingual bar becom es twisted out of shape.  8.69.3. Although it is possible to m ake a rest out of solder or to solder a clasp arm  at its shoulder, the odds that this type of repair m ight fail are high. S oldering is ordinarily  done with the  framework aligned on a cast. The dentist first  makes an impression o f the RPD seated in th e patient’s mouth. The RPD stays in the impression, the parts of the frame and the base that have no influence on the repair are blocked out, and a cast is poured in dental stone.  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  503 s. Som etimes, however, wet tissue 8.69.4. Because soldering applies high  heat to the fracture site, th e resin components of the RPD must be ins ulated against damage. A common practice is to provi de protection by adapting wet  tissue over all acrylic resin partis not com pletely effective because the fracture site is too close to the resin area. Under these conditions, make a stone matrix to reco rd th e position o f the  denture teeth. Remove the teeth and base from  the fra mework, perform the soldering operation, and then reattach the teeth with new acrylic to the framework.  8.69.5. To guarantee the integrity of any repair is a gamble. Many times, the strength of a repair is open to question. Too often, a design deficiency is responsible for the problem  in the first place,  and the repair solves nothing. From  a practical point  of view, the com plexity and life expectancy of a repair must be weighed agai nst the advisability of m aking an  entirely new prosthesis. In the final analysis, highly complicated , time-consuming rep airs of  short- lived value are  not jus tified unless the opportunity, talent, and equipment to make a new RPD are not available. 8.69.6.  The electric form of soldering is especially useful for soldering ne ar an acrylic resin denture bas e because h eating is highly localized  and the need to remove the denture base i n performing the repair may be elim inated (Figure 8.151). An electric soldering m achine works on the principle that all conductors of electricity offer resistance to current flow and become heated as a result. To solder, you should:  cast under and around the break site, if 8.69.6.1. Prepare the framework by roughening the sections to be joined. 8.69.6.2. Adapt platinum foil to the dental stonenecessary. The foil serves as a backing against which solder flows (Figure 8.151-A). 8.69.6.3. Seat the broken pieces of the framework on the cast and secure them with sticky wax.  8.69.6.4. Use soldering investment to hold the parts of the framework in correct position, but do not use excessive amounts of investment. Expose as much metal as possible (Figure 8.151-B). 8.69.6.5. Boil off the sticky wax after the soldering i nvestment has set. Adapt wet tissue to the acrylic resin parts on both sides of the fracture line, if present. 8.69.6.6. Place the cast on a soldering stand. 8.69.6.7. Select a carbon tip that is adequate for th e size of the repair. Make sure you adjust the machine to the proper settings for the work you are doing. 8.69.6.8. Generously apply flux in the joint area and  over both sections. The application of flux is critical to the success of the repair. A flux with a watery consistency gives the best results. 8.69.6.9. Cut a piece of solder that is big enoug h to complete the repair on the first attem pt and place it on the jo int. The hea t generated to melt the first m ass of sold er causes oxid es to form that block the effective addition of m ore solder. Use  Ticonium  triple-thick white solder  f or electric soldering because the additio nal bulk  of this solder retards m elting long enough to let  the framework parts heat up as well. The parts to  be joined have to be  as hot as the m elting solder or satisfactory union does not occur. 8.69.6.10. Make the ground electrode contact the m etal framework and wet the carbon tip in a bowl of water to improve current conduction before you turn the current on. Place the electrode firmly against the solder (Figure 8.151-C). 8.69.6.11. Press the foot pedal and allow tim e for th e solder to flow fr eely. Release the foot pedal.  Never  remove  the  carbon  electrode  from  the  solder  while  the  foot  pedal  is  depressed (that is, while current is flowing through the case). Sparks will jump from the carbon tip to the solder causing surface pitting. 504  Figure 8.151. Soldering Procedures. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  8.69.6.12. Re move the soldered fram ework fr om the cast and finish and polish as needed (Figure 8.151-D). 8.69.7. Torch soldering is used when the solder joint is long, or unusually bulky or when you need a large m ass of solder to do the job. Use a gas that is a mTiconium standard solder for all torch soldering operations as follows: ixture of propane and oxygen and  proper relationship and tem porarily secure 8.69.7.1. Use a heatless stone to roughen the ends of the sections to be joined. 8.69.7.2. Adapt platinum foil to the stone cast so it extends under both sections. 8.69.7.3. Seat the broken sections on the cast inthem with sticky wax. Flow sticky wax into the joint to be soldered. 8.69.7.4. Pull the broken parts of the RPD from the cast as one unit. Lay old burs across the two sections with a liberal amount of sticky wax. Use as many burs as needed to keep the fragments accurately related. Do n ot use wood sticks as a s ubstitute for burs becau se, when th e case is invested, water may cause the sticks to warp, jeopardizing the accuracy of the repair. 8.69.7.5. Carefully remove the framework from the cast. The platinum foil should come with it. 8.69.7.6. Adapt baseplate wax to the tissue side of the platinum foil. The edges of the wax must end 2 mm short of the foil edge on both sides of the break. 8.69.7.7. Embed the fram ework in soldering investm ent. The investment m ust hold the pieces of the framework together in correct alignment when the burs are removed. Cover the baseplate AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  505 wax and platinum  foil, com pletely exposing the  oral side of the break and as much of the peripheral metal as possible. 8.69.7.8. After the investment sets, boil out the wa x. Put the case in a dehydration oven at 190 oF for 1 hour to remove the moisture from the investment. 8.69.7.9. Regulate the flame of a propane-oxygen torch until the blue green tip is visible. NOTE: This cone—the reducing part of the flame—is used for soldering. 8.69.7.10. Cover the joint thoroughly with flux. Next, lightly brush-flame the flux until it dries  and has a powdery appearance.  Heat th e 8.69.7.11. Pick up th e solder with  a pair of tw eezers an d dip it in to the flux.framework to a dull red glow with the reducing part of the f lame. Feed the str ip into the join t while you keep the framework hot with the torch . The heat of the metal pieces should melt the solder, not the direct application of the flam e to the strip. (Direct m elting of the strip causes over hea ting of  the so lder, which  c auses p itting.) Once you begin the so lder procedure, you must complete it. Do n ot remove the flame from the work because coo ling allows rapid ox ide formation. 8.69.7.12. Remove the case from  the investm ent and finish and polish it. Try the fram ework back on the cast for fit. 8.69.8. Common framework repairs are as follows: 8.69.8.1. Warped Mandibular Lingual Bar: 8.69.8.1.1. Use a disc to cut the lingual bar into separate right and left sections. 8.69.8.1.2. The dentist will seat th e ind ividual part s in th e patient’s  mouth and m ake the required impression. 8.69.8.1.3. With the RPD sections seated in the im pression, block out all fram ework and denture base undercuts that do not  affect the su ccessful completion of the repair. P our the cast. 8.69.8.1.4. Follow electric soldering procedures to rejoin the RPD parts. 8.69.8.2.  Warped  Maxillary  Palatal  Strap. This repa ir dif fers s ignificantly f rom the procedures used to repair the  lingual bar. The line of separation  between the m etal sections is much longer, and the strap is a candidate for to rch soldering rather than electric soldering. The denture teeth and all resin areas of the RPD must be removed and ultimately replaced. 8.69.8.2.1. Cut all the way through the m ajor connector along the m ost severe part of the bend to produce both left and right sections.

A separating medium is applied to the base of the cast, and a plas ter matrix that extends from the not ch onto the occlusal and incisal edges of the denture teeth is made. 506  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 8.69.8.2.4. Re move the RPD from the cast. Take the denture teeth off the base by any convenient means, making every effort to preserve them intact. Heat-soften the denture base resin and separate it from the framework. 8.69.8.2.5. Place the stripped fram ework sections b ack on  the cast.  Proceed to m end the major connector by the torch soldering method described earlier. 8.69.8.2.6. Finish and polish the fram ework, fit it to  the cast, and use the m atrix to align the denture teeth in their original positions. There  are two ways teeth can be reattach ed to the framework in a new denture base: (1) autopolyme rizing resin can be sprinkled into place, or (2) th e areas can be w axed to con tour and th en invested and proces sed with heat cured acrylic. 8.70. Clasp Assembly Repairs: 8.70.1. Clasp Arm Breaks. The most common kinds of clasp damage are for one of the arms of a circumferential clasp to break off or to fracture a bar clasp approach arm: 8.70.2. Circumferential Clasp Arm. When such a break occurs adjacent to an area that carries a resin denture base, the repair is simple. Bend 18-gauge Ticonium  wire into proper shape for a replacement arm and embed a substantial retentive loop in the denture base with self-curing resin. 8.70.3. Bar Clasp Approach Arm. Bar clasp ap proach arms always exit a denture base on their way to the surface of a tooth. There are two options in fixing such breaks . The first is to substitute an 18-gauge wrought wire circum ferential clasp ar m for the bar clasp approach arm  and proceed as in paragraph 8.70.2 above. However, this m ethod changes the m echanics of the RPD. If a bar clasp was used originally, there m ust have been  a reason. C onsult the dentist before m aking the change. In the second option, the  assumption is that the clasp frag ment was saved. Electrically solder a retention lug to the clasautopolymerizing resin. 8.70.4. Minor Connector Supporting All or Part of a Clasp Assembly Break. The following two conditions are possible: p fragm ent  and em bed the lug in the denture base with 8.70.4.1. The broken piece is salv ageable. W hen the m inor connecto r supports a clasp that occupies an embrasure, electrically solder th e piece directly to the fram ework. If the broken  part is an in tact circumferential clasp situated next to a resin denture base , electrically solder a retention lug to the body of the clasp and embed the lug in the denture with self-curing resin. 8.70.4.2. The broken p iece has been lost.  Under th is condition, a replacem ent clasp assembly must be made. Either cast a replacement or fabricate one from wrought wire and melted solder. Fasten the clasp assem bly to   the RPD by using a retention lug and self-curing resin or by electrically soldering the assembly to the framework. Pick the most appropriate method for the situation. 8.70.5. Rest Repair. Most rest repairs are a m atter of  having a fra mework properly seated on a  cast and electrically puddling solder in the place where the old rest was. Rests break because the y are too th in in th e first place or  because they are liter ally chewed off. This  frequently happens when rest seats are not deep eis weaker than cast m etal. Consequently, a solder rest has to be thicker th an its cast counterpart. Th e dentist must perfor m significant adjustments on opposing teeth to make the repair succeed. nough.

Orthodontic appliances m ay be rem ovable, fi xed, or a com bination of both. Most of the time, an appliance can be classified as fixed or removable depending on its anc horage. (A patient cannot rem ove a fixed appliance.) Fixed appliances are generally anchored by m etal bands cemented to anchoring teeth. A la rge group of rem ovable orthodontic appliances get anchorage from acrylic resin denture bases retained by wrought  wire clasps. The focus of our interest in this  Chapter is on sim ple fixed and removable orthodon tic appliances m ade by dental technicians in the laboratory. The devices described are capabl e of perform ing limited, minor tooth m ovements and holding functions. They do not com pare to  the highly com plex systems of bands and wires  assembled by orthodontists in a patient’s mouth. 9.1.2. Fixed and removable appliances are further classified as active or passive. Active devices are designed to move teeth into a m ore esthetic and  functional alignment in a dental arch. Move ment results from forces exerted by spring wire atattachments, or rubber bands, have to be “anchored” to stable dentition to make other teeth that are not as firm ly anchored change pos ition. One definition of a  passive appliance is th at it hold s or maintains teeth in the positions they already occupy. The concept of anchorage is just as important for passive orthodontic appliances as it is for active devices. A passive appliance’s anchorage must be more resistant to movement than the teeth the appliance is supposed to stabilize.  tachments or rubber bands. These spring wire  Section 9B—Orthodontic Materials 9.2. Orthodontic Wires: 9.2.1. Orthodontic appliances rely heavily on stainle ss steel wires to passive ly hold or actively move teeth. The 18-8 and  Elgiloy® are two types of stainless steel wire frequently used. Both are chrome-nickel-iron alloys. Elgiloy® contains substantial amounts of cobalt and m olybdenum, and it is supposed to be more resistant to breakage when bent at sharp angles. 9.2.2. The wires are manufactured by being drawn condition. They are available in round, rectangular, and square cross-sections and in various states of springiness. Besides the purchase options already mentioned, orthodontic wires come in a series of graduated sizes, generally measured in thousandths of an inch. 9.2.3. The wires used for the kinds of appliances made in military dental laboratories are ordinarily very springy and round in cross-section. The wi re sizes for common holding, m oving, and clasping applications vary from .014 to .036 inch.  NOTE: When selecting wire of proper size and temper, it is better to use wire that is too large a nd too soft rather than wire th at is too small and too highly tempered. 9.3. Orthodontic Bands:  through dies and are supplied in wrought 9.3.1. Orthodontic bands are most often made of stainless steel alloys. Molar bands are 0.005 inch (0. 127 mm) thick and 0.180 to 0.250 inch (4.6 to 6.3 mm) wide. Premolar  and anterior band materials are 0.003 to 0.004 inch (0.076 mm to 0.100 mm) thick and from 0.13 to 0.18 inch (3.3 to 4.55 mm ) wide. The width selected is determ ined  by the height of the clinical crown and the position the band is going to occupy on the tooth.  508  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 9.3.2. The use of bands  is m ost oft en associated  with fixed orthodontic appliances. Laboratory made, fixed orthodontic appliances are assembled on casts. Normally, the bands are first placed or fitted onto the necessary teeth by the dentist; then  a pickup i mpression is m ade. The subsequent cast then has the bands firmly positioned in the correct locations for the appliance to be fabricated. Various attachm ents and wires can  be sold ered or welded  to  bands for purposes  of holding or moving teeth.  9.3.3. The finished fixed appliance is then cemented into the patient’s mouth. The most commonly used bands  are prefabricated band s (stainless st eel). Prefabricated bands  are p reformed to f it maxillary and mandibular teeth. They come closed and do not require soldering or spot-welding to close them. The bands are available in a full range of sizes and are easily adapted to fit almost any tooth’s circumference (Figure 9.1).  Figure 9.1. Prefabricated Band. restoration or not. If the natura 9.4. Preformed Crowns. Preformed crowns are made of stainless steel. They come in a variety of sizes and shapes to fit almost any tooth in a dental arc h. Like orthodontic bands, the use of preformed crowns is also associated with fixed orthodontics appliances . Attachments and wires are  fastened to the crowns to form the applian ces. The decisio n to use a p reformed crown rather than a band usually depends on whether the natural tooth requires l tooth is badly broken down, a preformed stainless steel crown would probably be used to cover the tooth and retard its deterioration. 9.5. Attachments for Bands and Crowns. Hooks, eyelets, tubes, bracke ts, and other attachments m ay be soldered or welded to bands and crowns to en able the appliance to serve many purposes (Figure 9.2). Most of the time these attachments are chosen from prefabricated, commercially available stocks.  9.6. Acrylic Resin. Autopolymerizing resin is an integral pa rt of many kinds of removable orthodontic appliances. The plastic becomes the resistance or anchorage portion of the appliance against which other elements of the device act to m ove or hold teeth.  Orthodontic self-curing resi ns are usually m olded by the  sprinkle-on  method. Because the polym er powder is ex ceptionally fine, the polym er m ass stay s where it is put when wet down wicures. As a result, the plastic is nonporous, cleans well, and is strong. 9.7.  Solder. The joining of stainles s steel surfaces is  usually accom plished by spot-welding or silver soldering. Although the corrosion resist ance of silver solders is low  compared to gold solders, it isacceptable. Silver so lders melt at about 1150  oF; gold solders fuse at around 1400  oF. Temperatures in excess of 1250 oF cause stainless steel wire to soften and lose its springiness. 9.8. Soldering Flux. Silver soldering requires using a fluorand silver solder is a mechanical one. Besides ridding the stainless steel of its oxide layer, a fluoride flux etches the metal so that solder will bond to it better.  th m onomer. Autopolymerizing or thodontic resin is dense after it ide flux. The bond between stainless steel AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 9.2.

Arch former (Figure 9.3-E). This is a convenient template for making the primary curve in a labial bow. 9.10. Method of Bending Wire:  wire in the pliers with one hand and bend it 9.10.1. Gradual bends in orthodontic wire are made  with the fingers. Ac ute bends require the use of pliers as well. The pliers should be regarded as a vise to hold the wire while it is being bent.  9.10.2. Before bending the wire, pos ition the wire  on the working cas t and m ark where the bend should be m ade with a wax pencil. Hold the downward over a beak of the pliers with the free hand.  9.10.3. Never bend round wire over a sharp-edged bea k. Instead, bend it over the rounded beak of the pliers so that the wire does not become nicked.  9.10.4. Before making the next bend, place the wire  back on the working cast and check the bend just made. Try to keep all bends at right angles to  the long axis of the wire so the to rque will be incorporated into the wire and all bends will be in the same plane.  9.10.5. W hen bending short sections ofa clasp, start with the m ore  wire, such as a spring or critical areas (usually toothborne areas). Then  bend the easier sections. (This does not apply to a  labial bow or helical spring.)  9.10.6. When making a com plex series of bends, such  as used in a labial bow or helical spring, begin in the center of the wire and work to either end. 9.11.  Wire-Bending. Consider the following paragraphs as an  exercise in wire-bending and take the time to practice m aking the different bends, using shor t pieces of orthodontic  wire. A few of the m ore common wire-bending maneuvers are as follows: 9.11.1. Closed-End Loop: 9.11.1.1. Used as the mechanical retention portion  of orthodontic wires that are anchored in acrylic. One way to retain the wire in the acrylic is to use a large closed-end loop. 9.11.1.2. To fabricate a closed-end loop, first place th e bird beak pliers with the working end facing you and the square beak pointing up. Then firm ly grasp the end o f a piece of wire with  the pliers. T he size of the loop will depend  on where you place the wire in the jaws of the pliers. The smallest loop is made near the very tip end; the larger loops are m ade as you move the wire closer to the hinge. Hold the pliers in position and turn the wire around the beak of the pliers (Figure 9.4). W ith the pliers held still,complete the closed-end loop.  bend the wire back at a 45-degree angle to 9.11.2. Zigzag Bend: 9.11.2.1. This is another type of wire-bending maneuver that is used for mechanical retention in the acrylic resin. 9.11.2.2. To fabricate the zigzag bend, start with the three-prong pliers  facing you and the middle prong facing up. Firm ly grasp the wire. Squ eeze the wire to m ake a slight b end in th e wire. Reposition the pliers so th e middle p rong faces down. Make another bend. R epeat these procedures until you reach the desired length of pattern (Figure 9.5). AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 9.4. Closed-End Loop. 511  Figure 9.5. Zigzag Bend.  9.11.3. Right-Angle Bend: 9.11.3.1. Many tim es, when m aking a clasp or spring,  the direction of th e wire must change abruptly. This is another one of the many uses for three-prong pliers. 9.11.3.2. With the working end of th e three-prong pliers facing up,  grasp the wire. Squeeze the pliers with one hand and apply finger pressure to the wire with the other until a 90-degree angle has formed (Figure 9.6). 9.11.4. Semicircular Bend: 9.11.4.1. A way of m aking short springs do the work of  long springs is to  include spiral loops or multiple bends in their design (paragraph 9.17.1). The semicircular bend is one such method. 9.11.4.2. Perform this maneuver in a sim ilar manner to the one used with the closed-end loop, except place the bird beak pliegradually bend it downward until the semicircle is complete (Figure 9.7). Hold the wire still while you rs in the center of the wire. 9.11.5. Helical Bend: 9.11.5.1. The helical bend, like the sem icircular bend,  is used in m aking springs. T his is the preferred method of increasing the “spring action” to wire becau se the helix produces a lighter force over a longer period of time. 512  Figure 9.6. Right-Angle Bend. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 9.7. Semicircular Bend.  9.11.5.2. Begin by m aking a sem icircular bend in a pi ece of wire. Reverse the position of the wire within the loop so the working end is f acing up and the square end faces down. Bend the  wire around until a circle  is formed (Figure 9.8). Again, inve rt the pliers 180  degrees and turn the wire until the he lix is complete. A helical b end can be made by using either the bird beak pliers or the Young’s loop bending pliers.  Figure 9.8. Helical Bend.  9.11.6. Deflection Bend: 9.11.6.1. You m ay have occasion to use th is b end wh ere the wire is needed to  contact an  isolated tooth or clear the opposing occlusion. 9.11.6.2. Grasp a piece of wire with the bird beak p liers and bend one end of the wire sligh tly downward against the round beak. W ith the pliers  held firm ly, bend t he other end of wire  slightly upward until the two angles formed are equal (Figure 9.9). AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 9.9. Deflection Bend. 513  9.11.7. Smooth-Curve Bend: 9.11.7.1. This bend is used primarily to adapt orthodontic wire to soft tissue and teeth. 9.11.7.2. Grasp the wire at the point where you wantclose to the hinge to m ake the  largest curve possible. Slowly  apply finger pressure around the beak of the pliers and, if necessary, reposition the pliers as you go (Figure 9.10).  to start the curve. The wire should be Figure 9.10. Smooth-Curve Bend.   9.12.  Sprinkle-On  Technique  for  Fabricating  Removable  Appliance  Anchorage. Removable appliance anchorage in the form   of a resin denture base is easily m ade with autopolym erizing orthodontic resin. The procedures for fabricating an acrylic resin base from self-curing orthodontic resin are indicated in Figure 9.11 and as follows: that w ould prevent ooth and tissue undercuts 9.12.1. Survey the cast and block out lingual tplacement of the appliance. The presence of so me lingual tooth undercut is desirable. Carve blockout wax back 1 to 2 mm gingival to the survey line. Round off any wax ledges created. 9.12.2. Place the working cast in a saturated calcium  SDS t o remove the air from  the cast. Blo w off excess water. Air left in the cast could result in air pockets between the resin base and the cast during curing. 9.12.3. Paint the area of the cast to be covered by acrylic with tinfoil substitute and let it dry. 9.12.4. Secure all springs, guards, bows, and clas ps with sticky wax. Do not place wax on the loops that will retain them in the resin. Ensure  loops are approximately 0.5 mm off the surface of the cast. 9.12.5. Cover the active portion of all  springs with wax to prevent  entrapping them in hardened resin. Later, when the wax is removed, the spring will have space to function. 9.12.6. Apply alternate portions of  powder and liquid to the desire d thickness. To better control the resin, do about a third of the  total area at a tim e. As soon as  the surface sheen disappears, add acrylic resin to another third (a nd so forth). To avoid unnecessary  finishing, apply the resin in an even layer, 2 to 3 mm thick. 514  Figure 9.11. Sprinkle-On Technique for Removable Orthodontic Appliance Anchorage. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  9.12.7. After the surface sheen dulls, place the appliance upside down in a pressure pot containing 110  oF water. Placing th e cast up side down m inimizes porosity caus ed by air escaping from  the cast. Apply 15 psi for 10 m inutes as per m anufacturer’s directions to ensure a dens e, well-cured appliance. 9.12.8. When the resin has set, remove the cast from  the pressure pot and  check the acrylic for flaws. If the cast is satisfactoreful to avoid  distortion. Shape and polish the base as you would the resin base areas of a removable denture. Be careful not to nick the wires or distort them. 9.12.9. After finishing and polishing, the acrylic batissue and the lingual surfaces of the teeth. Ho wever, if the appliance is an active one and a tooth is going to be m oved, space  must  be  provided  between  the  tooth  and  the  base  to  allow  that  movement. The dentist usually creates such a space with the patient present.  ry, rem ove the  appliance from  the cast, being case rests against soft 9.13.  Fixed  Appliance  Anchorage.  In m ost cases, depending on the dentist, you will not have to adapt  bands or crowns for fixed orthodon tic appliances. The dentist will  have done that part of the proced ure at chairside in the patient’s  mouth. The dentist then makes an impression with the band or crown in place. After the impression is removed from the mouth, the dentist seats the band or crown in the im pression and sends  the assembly to the labo ratory. The im pression is poured in dental stone. When the cast is sep arated from the im pression, the band or crown will occupy the same position on the dental stone tooth as it di d in the mouth. You can now finish the appliance on the cast in terms of attaching wires, tubes, hooks, etc. preferences of an individual 9.13.1. Soldering. Soldering is defined as the process of  joining two pieces of m etal by using a  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  515 third piece of metal whose melting range is lower  than those of the two being join ed. Orthodontic soldering is m ost often accom plished using  a handheld butane to rch. However, orthodontic soldering can be carried out with a Hanau alcoho l torch, specially designed  orthodontic soldering burner (blowpipe), or gas-air torc h with an orthodontic tip. Most of the procedures consist of soldering stainless steel parts together with silver solder. 9.13.2. Soldering Requirements. Six rules must be observed for successful soldering: 9.13.2.1. The surfaces o f the m etals to be jo ined  must be clean and as free from  oxides as possible. 9.13.2.2. The parts to be joined should be accurately related as follows: 9.13.2.2.1. For wire to wire, use a soldering jig (Figure 9.12).  Figure 9.12. Soldering Jig.  9.13.2.2.2. For wire to band or crow n, seat the ba nd or crown on a dental stone cast. Adapt the wire to the cast according to the dentist’s prescription. What remains is to solder the wire to the band or crown. Hold the wire i mmobile with wet tissue molded to the cast o r a small amount of stone laid over the wires adjacent to both sides of the area to be soldered. This not only helps to secure the wires, but also helps to protect the cast from  unnecessary heat damage from the torch. Anothe r similar method is to relate the wire to the band or crown with investment material (Figure 9.13). 9.13.2.3. The parts to b e joined sh ould be in contact with  each other.  ( EXCEPTION:  The major exception to this rule is that the so ldering te chniques used in  f ixed partial dentu re construction require a slight space between the parts to be joined.) 9.13.2.4.  The soldering of stainless st eel requires a fluoride paste flux. Paste flux is easy to place and confine to th e exact area  where it is needed. It etches  the su rfaces of th e steel and improves bonding. When metals are heated, they acquire a strong affinity for oxygen in the air. Unless provision is made for preventing significant oxidation, an oxide film will develop on the stainless steel and  form a barr ier b etween the solder and the  metal. W hen this happens, th e solder may ball up and fail to flow. If it does fl ow, it m ight not m ake a strong joint. The flux will protect the surface of the  metal by preventing the for mation of oxide or by removing any oxide that forms. 516  Figure 9.13. Soldering a Cantilever Loop to a Band. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  9.13.2.5. The joint being soldered must be able to be reached by the flame (accessible). It must also be visible so that the progress of the soldering operation can be observed. 9.13.2.6. Use the reducing part of the flam e and perform the soldering procedure quickly. The assembly must be preheated. Only  a slight am ount of additional  heat will be needed to m ake the solder flow. Do not solder with the tip o r outer zone of  the f lame. When this part of  the flame is applied to metal surfaces, oxidation occurs, requiring the application of additional flux. Instead, move inward from the tip of the flame to its reducing zone. Remove the flame from the assembly as soon as the solder flows into the  joint. Overheating causes weak joints. Soldering is best done in subdued light. The appearance of  the metal and the appearance of the solder are harder to observe in a bright light. 9.13.3. Soldering Method: 9.13.3.1. Lay out all materials for maximum convenience and quick availability. 9.13.3.2. Relate the parts to be soldered. 9.13.3.3. Make sure the parts are clean and in contact. 9.13.3.4. Apply flux. 9.13.3.5. Using the redu cing part of a fla me, heat the two pieces to be joined and observe th e action of the fluoride flux. The flux will bubble up and then melt. As the flux melts, it will take on the appearance of liquid glass. Begin to concentrate th e flam e on the larger o f the two pieces. Apply fluxed solder at the proposed pl ace of union. The solder  should flow sm oothly and promptly. Remove the flame immediately. 9.13.3.6. Take the appliance off the cast. Finish and polish it. 9.14. Spot-Welding. Spot-welding is the process of joining two pieces of metal by using a machine that generates high voltage electric curre nt. The parts to b e joined are h eld together by electrodes. As the  electric current passes through the work, resistance builds, heat is generated, metal melts, and a union of the parts occurs. A true weld is form ed, and no solder  or flux is used. This technique is used only on stainless steel alloys and is less commonly used in most soldering procedures (Figure 9.14).  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 9.14. Electric Spot-Welder. 517  Section 9D—Removable Orthodontic Appliances 9.15. Parts of an Appliance. Removable orthodontic appliances are composed of three distinct parts: movable orthodontic  appliances consists of an 9.15.1. Effecting Mechanism. The first part is a device or m echanism that moves teeth into new positions or holds teeth in existing p osition. These mechanisms consist of active or p assive bows along with springs, screws, or rubber bands that mostly have active orthodontic functions. 9.15.2.  Anchorage. Anchorage for reautopolymerizing resin base form ed to fit both   the palate and lingual su rfaces of teeth in the maxillary arch, or the lingual aspect of the alveo lar process and teeth in the m andibular arch. The effecting mechanism is em bedded in the ancho rage. Since the anchora ge is built to have a great deal of resis tance to m ovement, the effecting m echanism has a solid base from  which to push, pull, or hold. 9.15.3.  Retention. Retention is accom plished by various  popular form s of wrought wire clasps  embedded i n anchorage and adapted to existing natural teeth. The purpose of the clasps is to maintain th e anchorag e in place. The  Hawley  retainer  was the forerunner of the variety of removable appliances presently in use. Most are modifications of the Hawley principle. 9.16. Hawley Retainer. See Figures 9.15 and 9.16 and as follows: 9.16.1. Effecting Mechanism (Labial Bow). The method of bending the bow is shown in Figure 9.17. The bow is composed of a bow portion and bilateral canine loops. Wire sizes are .030 to .032 inches. 9.16.1.1. Bow. Use an arch-forming template to develop the arch’s initial ideal curvature. Then adapt the bow to the rotations and inclinations of individual teeth by be nding the wire with the  fingers or with the help of the pliers. Start  in the center and move towards one side. Bend the other half keeping the wire parall el to the occlusal p lane. For  best results, be sure the wire contacts the teeth in the middle thirds of the crowns’ facial surfaces. 9.16.1.2. Canine Loop (Vertical Loop). At about the m esial third of the canine on one side, make a 90-degree bend in the wire toward the gi ngiva. Next, use wire bending pliers to bend the closing portion of the loop (Figure 9.18). Ma ke the loop long enough to clear the gingival crest, but not so long that it di ps into the bottom of the buccal su lcus. The loop’s distal upright should descend vertically to premolar. the bucco-occlusal em brasure be tween the canine and first 518  Figure 9.15. Hawley Retainer—Occlusal View Showing Anchorage and Clasps. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 9.16. Hawley Retainer—Facial View Showing Labial Bow.  9.16.1.3. Adapting the Wire into the Palatal Area. Bend the wire into the occlusal embrasure and adapt it to the em brasure as closely as possible. Be certain the wire does not in terfere with the occlusion. Shape the rem aining wire to the lingual em brasure and extend the wire onto the palate. End the bow with an angled bend or loop fo r retention in the resin base. The palatal part of the bow should be elevated abou t 1/2 mm  off the cast’s surface so it will becom e firmly embedded in the resin o f the anchorage.  NOTE: Repeat the canine loop and palatal adaptation steps for the other side of the bow. 9.16.2. Retention. The common clasp forms used for reta ining removable orthodontic appliances are the circumferential, Adams, and ball. They are  custom bent from  wrought wire (Figure 9.19) as follows: 9.16.2.1.  Circumferential  Clasp.  The circum ferential clasp com es out of an occlusal embrasure area, is adapted to the facial surface of the tooth, and engages a mesial or distal zone of undercut opposite the em brasure  of origin. W ire sizes are .028  to .030 inches. It is also common for a circumferential clasp to pass distal  to the terminal abutment in a quadrant on the way to a mesiofacial zone of undercut. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 9.17.

AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  9.16.2.2. Adams Clasp. The Adams clasp is the most retentive of the wr ought wire clasps and is probably the m ost popular. Wire sizes are  .022 to .025 inches. The  method of bending this clasp is shown in Figure 9.20. The bending sequence for the Adams clasp is as follows:  Figure 9.20. Bending an Adams Clasp.  9.16.2.2.1. Make a 90-degree bend about 1 1/2 inches from the end of the wire. Lay the wire against the tooth, m easure the m esiodistal wi dth, and m ake another 90-degree bend that parallels the first. 9.16.2.2.2. With a pair of pliers,  bend each leg back  up to form  a loop. Adjust th e legs so  they fall in the interproximal areas and fit snugly against the tooth. The horizontal part of the AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  521 act. Ma rk the  heigh t of  the wire should cross the m iddle th ird of the tooth with no contocclusal embrasure on each leg with a grease pencil. 9.16.2.2.3. Bend each leg into its respective occlusal embrasure and make the wire touch the occlusal aspect of the contact  area. The wires should not inte rfere with the occlusion. Be sure the horizontal bar of the clasp still crosses the middle third of the tooth with no contact. 9.16.2.2.4. Cut off the excess wire and contour the re mainder to the palate, ending with an angled bend or loop to pr ovide retention in the acrylic base. Le ave about ½ mm space between the cast and the wire. 9.16.2.2.5. Adjust the loops previously adapted to the buccoproximal areas to fit well against the tooth’s surface. 9.16.2.3. Ball Clasp. This clasp is usually prefabricated  and is available in diam eters of 0.024 inch (0.6 mm ), 0.028 inch (0.7 mm ), or 0.040 i nch (1.0 mm). It is bent su fficiently to spring into mesio or distofacial undercuts. The ball size increases with an increase in wire size. 9.16.3. Anchorage: 9.16.3.1. Block out lingual undercuts on the cast as  previously described.  Paint the cast with tinfoil subs titute. Seal the bow and clasp in p using the “sprinkle-on” method.

If the dentist is going to use the retainer as a passive appliance,  leave the resin in contact with the lingual surfaces of  the anterio r teeth.

Most of the m odifications of the Hawley principle are designed as active applia nces. The effecting m echanisms cons ist of  various sp rings, rubber band systems, screws, and ramps instead of or in addition to a conventional labi al bow . Passive retainers sometimes require the use of clear acrylic shield s added on the labial bow. This not only gives the wire additional occlusal-gingival stability, but also helps eliminate unwanted tooth rotation in anterior teeth. 9.17.1. Springs:  9.17.1.1. Overview. Springs produce force when a wire’s at tempt to return from  a stressed to an unstressed condition is resisted. If a technician m akes springs as part of a rem ovable orthodontic appliance, the springs are bent and  subsequently positioned on the cast in a passive condition. The dentist activates them  before  pl acing the appliance in  the patient’s m outh. Springs are supposed to produce gentle pressures  over as long a route of travel as possible. Long springs are better able to  satisfy these requirem ents than short ones, but space is alm ost always at a premium in the mouth. A short spring can be made to have the desirable qualities of a long one by incorporating spiral loops or multiple bends into the spring’s design: 9.17.1.2. Helical Loop Springs: 9.17.1.2.1. The word  helical  means “having the for m of a spiral.” T he basic sh ape of a tag  which is helical loop spring is s hown in Figure 9.21. It consists of three parts: a embedded in the anchorage; a spiral coil which acts to make the spring behave like a longer one without a coil; and an arm which contacts a tooth and transmits force to it. Figures 9.21-B and 9.21-C show that the route tooth m ovement takes is largely a function of how the arm is angled.  522  Figure 9.21. Helical Loop Spring. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  9.17.1.2.2. Notice in Figure 9.21  that the tooth moves at a right  angle to the initial point of  contact of the spring. It is im portant to note that the  tag has to be of sufficient size and bent  in a way that holds it in the anchorage and keeps it from twisting in the plastic. 9.17.1.3. Finger Springs: 9.17.1.3.1. Finger springs are generally designed to m ove teeth either m esially or distally. Wire sizes range between .014 and .032 inches. The versions of this  spring m ade with lighter gauge wire are used on  anterior teeth (Figure 9.22). Heavier gauge finger springs can perform tasks like retra cting o r uprighting a molar that has  migrated and closed needed space (Figure 9.23). In Figures 9.22 and 9.23, not e that the springs are protected by  guards. If it were not for the guards, the springs would be  less likely to maintain proper contact with the teeth they are supposed to move.   Figure 9.22. Finger Springs and Guards for Anterior Tooth Movement.  9.17.1.3.2. In the case of the molar-retracting spring (Figure 9.23), the guard also guides the path of the molar as it moves distally. In Figure 9.22, the labial bow acts to steer or guide the path of incisor movement. The bow itself may be either active or passive.  9.17.1.3.3. Guards for springs can be made two different ways. First, as described above, the guard is placed over top of the spring’s arm and guides the path of the tooth and the spring’s AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  523 arm. In this method the guard and spring arm are not imbedded into the acrylic; only the tag is in the acrylic. Another m ethod is to place the guard under th e spring’s arm, block out the arm and guard with wax, and th en cover the en tire spring with  acrylic (Figure 9.24). W ith this method, the guard guides the path of the  spring arm and the acrylic  guides the path of the tooth. When blocking out th e spring arm  and guard w ith wax, do not build up the wax any thicker than the thickness of the wire and do not blockout the retentive tag.  Figure 9.23. Finger Spring (A) and Guard (B) for Uprighting a Molar.  Figure 9.24. Figure Spring With Guard (Alternate Method).  9.17.1.4. Canine Retractor-Premolar Holder (Figure 9.25). The finger springs discussed so far are lingually oriented. Although the  canine retractor-premolar holder is obviously another style of finger spring, it is classified separately because it is facially oriented with respect to the teeth. Wire sizes are .030 to .032  inches. W hen the spring is an chored at point “A” in Figure 9.25, the spring will retract the canine.  If the spring is  anchored just distal  to the canine, it can be made to prevent the premolar from drifting forward. 9.17.l.5. “W” Spring (Figure 9.26-A). Although this spring has a helical loop in it, it takes its name from the terminal series of bends that  look somewhat like a “W .” Wire sizes are .014 to .020 inches. The “W” spring is mostly used to move teeth facially. Because it rests on inclined tooth surfaces, a guard is constructed over the sp ring to ke ep it f rom sliding a long an inclin e (Figure 9.26-B). Observe the labial  bow. It has been bent to st op the ce ntral incisor after the tooth has been moved to an acceptable position in the dental arch. 524  Figure 9.25. Canine Retractor Finger Spring.

Space-Closing or Space-Regaining Appliance.   Section 9F—Trimming and Finishing Orthodontic Casts 9.21. Overview:   9.21.1. Orthodontic casts are used as  a three-dimensional aid to expl ain treatment to the patient  prior to orthodontic treatm ent. Orthodontic casts can then be m ade after treatment is com plete to show the amount of change or development that has occurred.  9.21.2. Casts are trimmed and finished  differently from  removable  and fixed prosthetic working casts. The b ase and sid es are trimmed so the heel s of the maxillary and  mandibular casts can be positioned on a flat surf ace with the teeth in  maximum intercuspation. T hey can als o be tu rned onto their right or left sides and the teeth will remain in maxim um intercuspation (Figure 9.36) . NOTE: The angles and height of the orthodontic cas t in the following trimm ing procedures m ay vary among dentist. However, the order of the steps should remain the same.  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Figure 9.36. Trimmed Orthodontic Casts. 529  9.22. Procedures: ay be accurately occluded during  of the cast should now be9.22.1. Following disinfection, pour im pressions by th e one- or two-step m ethod in orthodontic plaster or dental stone as dire cted by the dentist (Figure 9.37).  Technicians generally use rubber base former molds to form  the bases of the cast . This provides for the bul k of stone needed for trimming the cast and e liminates a line of  demarcation between the impre ssion and base of the cast. 9.22.2. Re move all nodules and excess stone so the casts mcertain trimming steps. 9.22.3. Place the m axillary cast on the  cast trimmer’s table. Stand the  cast with its occlusal plane contacting a right angle guide plate. The base  directed toward the trimming wheel. Place a folded, damp paper to wel between the guide plate and the stone teeth to reduce the p ossibility of chipping. Trim  the base of  the maxillary cast un til it is parallel with th e occlusal plane and 40 mm in height. 9.22.4. Remove the right angle guide plate and position the maxillary cast on the trimming table so the back of the cast can be trimmed. 9.22.5. Trim the back of the cast pterygomaxillary notch. For symmetry of the completed cast to be correct, it is critical for the back to be perpen dicular to the median raphe. If it is  a class II m alocclusion case, m ore space distally will be needed to prevent overtrimming the mandibular cast when it is in occlusion. 9.22.6. Place the back of the m axillary cast against the a ngulator guide. Set the  angulator guide at 65 degrees (Figure 9.37). Trim  one side to th e deepest part of the m ucobuccal fold. Repeat this step for the other side. 9.22.7. Place the back of the m axillary cast against the a ngulator guide. Set the  angulator guide at 22 degrees. Trim  the anterior un til you reach the  depth of the labia l vestibule fold and the cut is  from the canine em inence to the m idline. Repeat this step on the opposite side. The point of the anterior cuts should fall on an i maginary line that follows the median raphe. Use caution to avoid damaging the anterior teeth during this step. perpendicular to the m edian raphe and 6 mm short of the 530  Figure 9.37. Trimming Orthodontic Casts. AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  9.22.8. Place the m andibular cast in occlusion with  the trimmed m axillary cast. The dentist may have supplied an interocclu sal record for this purpos e. If an interocclusal  record is not provided, extreme care must be taken to avoid breaking teeth. If necessary, trim some plaster from the heels of the mandibular cast to get the upper and lower casts together. 9.22.9. With the cas ts in occlusion,  place th e base of the m axillary cast again st the right angle guide plate. Trim  the base of the m andibular cast until th e combined height in occlusion of the casts is 70 mm. 9.22.10. Place the m andibular cast on the trimm ing tabl e with the m axillary cast in occlusion. Trim the mandibular heel area, using the maxillary cast as a guide. Trim the mandibular cast until the maxillary cast just starts to make contact with the trimming wheel. This should enable the casts to stay in occlusion while on their backs. AFPAM47-103V1    15 NOVEMBER 2005  531 9.22.11. Place the back of the mandibular cast against the angulator guide. With the angulation set at 55 degrees, trim  one side to the d eepest part  of the m ucobuccal fold. Repeat this  for the other  side. 9.22.12. Trim the anterior portion of the m andibular cast parallel to its back cut, stopping when you reach the depth of the lab ial vestibule. Fi nish the cu t by rounding to each can ine area. The completed anterior cut should be an evenly rounded symmetrical form that extends from canine to canine area at approxim ately the deepest part of  the labial vestibule fold. Use caution to avoid damaging the anterior teeth during this step. 9.22.13. Place the cast in occlusion with the base of the mandibular cast on the trimming table. Set the angulator guide to 1 20 degrees. Trim the h eel (corners) of both cas ts until you reach 6 mm from the distobuccal cusp of the m ost terminal molar. Repeat this step on the opposite side. After completing this step the casts should stay in occlusion while setting on either heel. 9.22.14. After establishing correct height  and proper trim , finish all si des of the casts with a fine  grit trimming wheel if available. 9.22.15. Rinse the casts under running  water. Use a soft toothbrush  on the anatom ical portion to  remove any slurry left from the trimming process. To remove any blobs of material, use a rounded scraper in the mucobuccal fold area and a sharp instrument around the teeth. 9.22.16. Use the finest grained wet- dry sandpaper on a glass slab to rem ove the cast trimmer  marks. Do this under ru nning water, holding the su rface of the cast firmly again st perfectly flat sandpaper. 9.22.17. Let the cast dry  overnight. Fill holes with dry plaster or ston e. Add water u sing a camel hair brush. After the holes are filled , allow the casts to d ry thoroughly before stoning or sanding. Use a m inimum of water during  stoning or sanding. Dip the cast in water and rub dry. W ipe the residue away. 9.22.18. If needed, repeat all of the above to produce an acceptable cast. 9.22.19. After the cast is free of holes and scratches, dry it thoroughly. 9.22.20. Place the patient’s nam e and the date printed onmaxillary and mandibular casts. If a cast marking machine is available, use it instead. 9.22.21. Place the casts in liquid soap for 30 to 45 m inutes. Remove the casts from the soap, and rinse them under running water until all exces s soap is removed. Polish the casts with a sligh tly damp cloth, paper towel, or dry chamois and rub them to a high gloss.  gumm ed l abels on th e base of the   Section 9G—Administrative Information 9.23.

Overview: A3.1.1. Cases sent to a base dental laboratory or  area dental laboratory (ADL) m ust be packaged properly to ensure every effort is taken to eliminate damage or loss. The time and effort the dentist or laboratory technician puts into packaging each cas e is an investment in quality fabrication of a prosthesis. Time, effort, and m oney are lost if a  cast is dam aged or m isrouted due to inadequate packing or shipping procedures. Guidelines and pro cedures in this attachm ent are set up to help eliminate the possible loss or damage of a case.  A3.1.2. Always make sure any contaminated item has been disinfected and placed in a sealed bag before shipping. Packing and shipping the casts are significant parts of prosthodontic service. These jobs must be done properly to ensure maximum care is given to each case as follows: A3.2. Packing Materials: A3.2.1. Mailing Boxes. The shipping container m ust be  crush proof and shock resistant, and it must prevent movement of the contents during shipm ent. Two-piece cardboard boxes reinforced by metal staples on the corners are the standard  mailing cartons to be used. These boxes have a polyurethane foam  insert ideal for m ailing casts  (Figure A3.1). The three-piece inserts (which include top and bottom  covers) com e with th e center portion slotted with two rectangular openings.  Figure A3.1. Packing and Shipping Boxes.  A3.2.2.  Small  Plastic  Bottles. Film  containers or pharm acy bottles m ake good containers for protecting smaller items, such as dies and completed crown and fixed partial dentures. These items should be packed in the container with gauze or cotton balls. A3.2.3. Insulation. Supplementary insulation m ay be obtaine d with the use of styrofoam  beans, air bubble plastic sheets, or foam sheets.  568  A3.3. Methods for Packing and Shipping Dental Materials:  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 A3.3.1.  Casts. The preferred m ethod is a standard m ailing box with inserts. Make sure the patient’s name is written in  waterproof ink on the back of each cast. All item s accompanying the cast, such as stone straps, jaw relationship records, sm all plastic containers, etc., m ust also be marked. To prevent the adhesion of packing m aterials, the cast must be dry prior to packing. (It is possible for cotton to stick to a cast when the cas t is wet or damp.) Place only two casts in the box and pack them base to base (Figure A3.1).  NOTE: Most casts broken in shipm ent either have too many items in the box or the casts are packed with the teeth facing each other. A3.3.2.  Dies. Ensure the m argins on all dies have been  marked with a red wax pencil prior to shipment. Do not ship dies m ounted in the master cast. Remove the dies from the master cast and place them individually in a small plastic bottle filled with cotton. This container should be placed in the opening opposite the cast. To avoid using two m ailing boxes for the case, use sm aller containers and place them in the same box with the master and opposing casts. A3.3.3. Impressions. Normally, impressions are not shipped. However, due to the durability of polyvinylsiloxanne, it m ay be sent with the case. W hen another type of m aterial is used, m ake a second pour of the impression and send that cast also. The second pour or duplicate cast should be a solid working cast, leaving the tissue areas intact. A3.3.4.  Completed  Prostheses. To avoid desiccation of acrylic prostheses, package com plete dentures, partial dentures, and all acrylic applian ces in a self-sealing plastic bag with a wet cotton ball. When shipping RPD frameworks, always place them on the master or duplicate cast to avoid any damage to the fram ework or cast. W hen shipping crowns or fixed partial dentures, separate the restorations from  the dies and place them  individually in a sm all plastic container filled with cotton. Ensure restorations are well cushioned to avoid movement during shipment. A3.3.5. Completion. Once a case is packed, place a prescription form  (DD Form  2322,  Dental Laboratory Work Authorization) in each box so the contents can be identified. Place the copy of the DD Form 2322 on top of the foam  in the box  to avoid wrinkling or tearing the form . Wrap the box with paper and secure it with m ailing tape (Figure A3.1). W hen you use m ore than one box on a case, wrap the boxes together as a single unit. These actions prevent the boxes from  being separated and decrease the possibility of  loss. Never apply any kind of  tape directly to the mailing boxes; only tape over the wrapping paper in  order to avoid dam age to the box. Questions about mailing restrictions can best be answered by mailroom or post office personnel. A3.4. Jaw Relation Records: A3.4.1. Jaw relation records are fragile, come in many different shapes and sizes, and require care when packed for shipm ent. The preferred jaw relations are those set chem ically, not in thermoplastic. Gypsum products, zinc oxide-eugenol pastes, and acrylic resin products are safe for shipping when properly packaged. A3.4.2. W ax cannot be used as a registration m aterial because the container m ust go through temperature fluctuations during shipm ent. This cau ses the wax index or registration to distort, rendering it inaccurate.  A3.4.3. All of the jaw relation record s mentioned so far are intraoral records. There is a particular form of articulation record that uses  stone straps external to opposing casts. ADLs prefer stone straps rather than intraoral records. Partially ed entulous cases that cannot be hand articulated with certainty should be mounted.  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  A3.4.3.1. Fabricating Stone Straps: 569 A3.4.3.1.1. Using a large pear-shaped acrylic bur , place two indexing dim ples in each side of the m axillary cast in the ar t portion of the base (Figure A3.2). Repeat this step for the mandibular cast as well. Using an interocclusal jaw relation record provided by the dentist, hand articulate the casts. Reinforce this asse mbly with steel wires or burs and com pound. Apply separator to the indices and surrounding area. Use wet tissues to block out the anatomical portions in the area the straps will occupy.  A3.4.3.1.2. Fashion a rectangle of dental stone a bout 10 mm thick to cover the four pairs of indices. After the stone is set, remove the stone straps and disassemble the casts. Remove all traces of com pound left on the casts. Hand articulverify their reliability as an articulation record. ate the casts, using the stone straps to  Figure A3.2. Stone Strap Fabrication.   A3.4.3.2. Packing Jaw Relation Records. Place the record bases on the m aster cast and wrap them securely with a suitable packing m aterial before placing them  in the f oam inserts. Ship small jaw relation records (covering only a few teeth) in a sm all plastic bottle. Place stone straps in the mailing boxes alongside the foam inserts. A3.5. Articulators. Do not  mail articulators to another base dental laboratory or ADL because proper packing is difficult and there are alternative procedur es that can be successful . Instead of shipping an articulator, use a f acebow mounting of the maxillary cast to relate the casts to a certain articulator. If  a Whip-Mix 2000-series articulator is used, both the  maxillary and mandibular cast may be mounted and sent. Make sure the receiving laborat ory has the sam e type of articulator. If the lab does not have the Whip-Mix 2000-series articulator, m ount only the m axillary cast on an articulator that is sim ilar to one at the receiving laboratory. W hen the dentist provide s appropriate jaw relation records or articulator settings, it is possible to program an alternative articulator as well as the original. A3.6.  Checklist  for  Case  Submission.  Before m ailing cases to dental laboratories, ask yourself the following questions: A3.6.1. For DD Form  2322 (according to AFI 47-101,  Managing  Air  Force  Dental  Services, Attachment 15): A3.6.1.1. Are mold, shade, shade guide type, and staining characteristics included? A3.6.1.2.

Overview. Denture teeth may be stocked in varieties  and quantities appropriate to local usage. A denture tooth stock m anagement system should be es tablished to order and stock the teeth. The dental laboratory officer or noncom missioned officer in charge (NCOIC) determ ines what those local requirements are and how the teeth are managed. A4.2. Procurement of Denture Teeth: A4.2.1. The Defense Supply Center (part of the De fense Logistics Agency) negotiates contracts and initiates blanket purchase order agreem ents with major tooth manufacturers for denture teeth. Copies of these contracts should be available to all command and base dental surgeons, area dental laboratory officers, base m edical materiel managers, and base contracting officers. Orders should only be placed from current contracts. A4.2.2. These contracts are for a pe riod of 1 year. The contractor m ust reach an agreem ent with the dealers in the vicinity of each base dental fvicinity, continental United States (CONUS) demanufacturer or principal depot. A4.2.3. The contracts should contain an exchange priv ilege that allows return of individual teeth or broken sets to the dealer or m anufacturer. Further, the exchange privilege that the local dealer implements should be thoroughly understood by all concerned. A4.2.4. Overseas bases that have no available dealdirectly from the manufacturer’s principal depot in the CONUS. acility.

Cut off the previous year’s file and stforward the m ost current stock level sheets and ailes. Dispose of contents that rem ain in the previ ous year’s file according to AFMAN 37-123 and the Air Force RDS. A4.4.3. Review stock level sheets annually. Date a nd initial each review. Adjust levels any tim e expenditure rates change. When adjustments are made, reaccomplish the stock level sheets. A4.4.4. Make use of the service stock level m ethod (maximum amount to be m aintained). Place orders as needed to keep stock on hand at the esta blished levels. Use the exchange privilege to the maximum (paragraph A4.2.3). Date orders for teet h when they are subm itted. When orders are received, verify them against the manufacturer or dealer invoice and date and initial the invoice. A4.4.5. Maintain the file in a single folder wher e possible. To provide easy comparison and usage data, arrange orders due in or received in a chronological sequence.  A4.5. Storage of Denture Teeth. For reasons of economy and efficiency, denture teeth will be stored in tooth cabinets. A4.5.1. Tooth storage cabinets can be ordered frnonmenclature and stock num ber: cabinet, t ooth assortment, compartmented, NSN 6520-00-511-0010. A4.5.2. Locally constructed cabinets m ay be used if  each set of teeth can be segregated in an individual compartment. A properly designed cabinet should have: om m edical logistics, using the following A4.5.2.1. Compartmented space for each stock level of teeth. A4.5.2.2. Space for a moderate increase in stock levels and broken sets of teeth. A4.5.2.3. Drawers that allow ready access to all compartments. A4.4.2.4. Labels on drawers and compartments. A4.5.3. Arrange sets of teeth in the cabinet, usi ng shade as the prim ary index. Follow the sam e sequence as the stock level sheets. Segregate m axillary and m andibular anteriors and posteriors for each type of tooth. File broken sets in the same drawer with complete sets to keep the breaking of complete sets to a minimum and to identify exchange options.  574  AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 Attachment 5 SUBJECT INDEX   erizing, 2.44 ic, 2.62 e, 2.63 2.59 conventional gold, 2.60 heat curing, 2.42 7.119 A Acids, 2.87 Acrylic resins   autopolym  processing, Alcohols, 2.82 Alginate impressions, 2.40.2 Alloys  ceram chrom  definition, Anatomy, bony cranial bones, 3.8  facial bones, 3.9  Anatomy, dental (tooth)    periodontium Anatomy, muscle, 3.20 Anatomy, oral (soft tissue), 3.8   tongue,  Angle’s classification, 5.6 Annealing, 2.56.2 Anterior guidance (see mutually protected occlusion), 5.26 Antifluxes, 2.80  Arrangement, artificial teeth       basic anterior, 7.67, 7.69 characterized anterior, 7.72 immediate denture, 7.161 landmark relationships, 7.64 posteriors , 7.77, 7.78 RPD denture base, 8.55 basic tooth features, 4.8 crown morphology, 4.6 lower jaw, 3.38 3.39 upper jaw, 3.37 , 4.5 tooth descriptions, 4.13 575 definition and purpose, 6.1 complete denture, 7.47.1.3.4 general comments, 6.5.5.1 ent, 7.62 advantages of plastic, 7.55 advantages of porcelain, 7.55 AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005  Articulators   types, 6.3 Articulator settings   Artificial teeth    arrangemdesign features, 7.53   selection factors, 7.56, 7.59 Asymmetrical occlusion pattern, 5.28 Autopolymerizing resin, 2.44 Auxiliary ligaments (temporomandibular joint), 3.50  B Balanced complete denture occlusion, 7.8 Base metal alloys, 2.6.4.1 Baseplates (see record bases), 7.40 Bearing areas, denture, 7.39.1, 7.39.2 Bennett angle, 5.21.5 Bennett movement (sideshift) 5.21.4 Beryllium hazards, 2.6.3.1.3 Blockout and ledging, 8.42.1.4 Blockout wax formula, 8.42.1.4.1 Boilout, 7.107 Bones of the skull, 3.7 Borders, complete denture axillary, 7.39.1  m mandibular, 7.39.2 Boxing, final impression, 7.32 Bracing components, 8.41 Burnout, RPD pattern, 8.51    AFPAM47-103V1     15 NOVEMBER 2005 ic, 2.62 e, 2.63 andibular, 7.48 axillary, 7.47 diagnostic, 7.25  2.19.1 trimming and finishing, 7.23, 7.26  2.19.3 master, 7.32  mounting, 6.12, 6.13, 7.46 pouring, 7.25, 7.26 ounting, 7.130 576  C Casting alloys  ceram chrom conventional gold, 2.60 Cast mounting, complete denture  facebow transfer, 7.47.2.1  m mCast mounting, RPD, 8.40  Casting procedures, RPD pattern, 8.51  Casts   erosion,     rem  wetting, Centric relation, 5.3 Ceramic alloys.
