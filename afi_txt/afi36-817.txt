Phased  Retirement  Policy.  This  instruction  establishes  a  process  under  which  an  Air Force employee may request phased retirement. 1.1.1.  The  provisions  of  phased  retirement  allow  management  officials  to  authorize  certain employees, who are otherwise eligible to retire, the option to work and be paid for a half-time schedule of 40 hours per pay period while drawing partial retirement benefits for a specified length of time.  The employee's work schedule changes from full-time to part-time status. 1.1.2.  The  purpose  of  phased  retirement  is  to  provide  a  period  of  transition  into  full retirement during which the employee mentors (transfers knowledge to) others for 20 percent (eight  hours)  of  the  half-time  work  schedule.    Phased  retirement  is  a  human  resources management tool.  It is not an employee entitlement. 1.1.3.  While an employee is in phased retirement, the employee continues to remain on the same position authorization the employee was on prior to phased retirement. 1.1.4.  Phased retirement employees are not to be moved to an over-hire billet or to another authorization while in phased retirement. 1.2.  Non-Discrimination  Statement.  This  instruction  is  to  be  administered  without  unlawful discrimination  because  of  race,  color,  religion,  sex  (including  pregnancy,  gender  identity,  and sexual  orientation),  national  origin,  age  (40  or  older),  disability,  genetic  information,  or  prior Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) activity. AFI36-817  28 JUNE 2017 3 Chapter 2 RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.

Hiring of a part-time employee to execute the remaining fifty (50) percent manning hours or the hiring of a full time over hire may only be accomplished if funding is available to support both the phased retiree's part-time salary and the part time/full time replacement. 3.9.  Time Limit Agreement.  As a condition for approval, an agreement between the employee and  supervisor  must  be  reached,  establishing  start  and  end  dates.    This  agreement  must  be documented  on  the  DD  Form  3018  and  signed  by  the  employee,  supervisor,  and  approving 8 AFI36-817  28 JUNE 2017 official PRIOR to the commencement of the phased retirement.

At the end of the time limit agreement, the phased retiree’s retirement is processed. 3.10.  Disapproved Applications.  Phased retirement is not an employee entitlement and not all employees  and/or  positions  are  suited  for  phased  retirement.    Authorized  approving  officials must  indicate  disapproval  on  the  DD  Form  3018,  section  B,  and  return  the  form  to  the employee’s  supervisor  for  filing  in  the  Supervisor’s  Employee  Work  Folder.    A  copy  is  to  be provided to the employee. (T-1) 3.11.  Ending Phased Retirement Status.  An employee may request to end phased retirement through the following methods: 3.11.1.

If the employee fails to take any action within three (3) calendar days prior to the end of the time limit agreed upon, the employee will be deemed to have elected full, immediate retirement and such separation will be considered voluntary, based on the written agreement IAW 5 CFR §831.1731(b) and 848.203. (T-0) AFI36-817  28 JUNE 2017 9 3.12.  Denial of an Employee’s Request to Return to Regular Employment.

Denial  of  a  request  to  enter  phased  retirement  or  a  request  to return  to  regular  employment  may  only  be  grieved  if  the  position  is  a  bargaining  unit  position and  covered  by  the  negotiated  grievance  procedure  under  the  collective  bargaining  agreement (CBA).  Decisions  surrounding  phased  retirement  are  not  considered  "adverse  actions"  under  5 U.S.C. Chapter 75 and are not appealable to the Merit Systems Protection Board, to include but not  limited  to  decisions  to  disapprove  the  employees  request  to  return  to  regular  full-time employment. 3.14.  Retirement.  A phased retiree who is not approved to return to full time status or able to obtain an extended agreement or is unable to transfer to a different agency by the expiration date of the phased retirement agreement will be considered to have elected full, immediate retirement and such separation will be  considered voluntary, based on the  written  agreement  IAW 5 CFR §831.1731(b) and 848.203. (T-0) 10 AFI36-817  28 JUNE 2017 Chapter 4 MENTORING IN PHASED RETIREMENT 4.1.  Mentoring Requirement.  Mentoring is an essential element of phased retirement intended to  allow  the  transfer  of  knowledge  and  skills  from  a  well-experienced  employee  to  other employees who are less experienced.  It  is  not  limited to those employees who may assume the duties of the phased retiree upon regular retirement. 4.1.1.  A minimum of 20 percent (i.e. 8 hours) of the employee’s part-time work hours each pay period are to be spent performing mentoring activities. 4.1.2.  Mentoring  hours  may  be  distributed  over  the  bi-weekly  pay  period  and  are  to  be recorded in the appropriate time and attendance system. 4.1.3.  The approving official is authorized to waive the requirement only in the event of an emergency or other unusual circumstances (including being called for active-duty, invocation of  the  Family  Medical  Leave  Act  (FMLA))  that  would  make  it  impractical  for  the  phased retiree to fulfill the mentoring requirement. 4.1.4.  The  phased  retiree  is  to  develop  a  mentoring  plan  that  identifies  the  mentee  to  be mentored, mentee objectives, activities for achieving objectives, and other supporting details. 4.1.4.1.  The mentoring plan is subject to the supervisor’s endorsement and the approving official’s approval. 4.1.5.  The employee is to carry out the mentoring requirement beginning the effective date on which the phased retirement commences. 4.1.6.  The performance standards of phased retirees are to be modified in writing to include the mentoring activities. 4.2.  Types of Mentoring.  Mentors may perform different roles which include: 4.2.1.  Advisor:  The  mentor  initiates  communication  and  helps  the  mentee  formulate  career goals. 4.2.2.  Coach:  The  mentor  supports  in  identifying  developmental  needs,  recommending training opportunities, and imparting skills and behaviors. 4.2.3.  Facilitator:  The  mentor  assists  in  finding  resources  for  problem  solving  and  career progression. 4.2.4.  Advocate:  The  mentor  recommends  opportunities  for  projects  allowing  others  to observe positive capabilities of the mentee. 4.3.  Mentoring  Expectations.  For  additional  information,  see  AFMAN  36-2643,  Air  Force Mentoring Program.  A phased retiree serving as a mentor should: 4.3.1.  Exemplify Air Force Core Values. 4.3.2.  Provide  practical  counsel  by  offering  guidance,  providing acknowledging accomplishment. feedback,  and AFI36-817  28 JUNE 2017 11 4.3.3.  Support  mentee’s  career  planning  and  goal  setting  by  using  a  developmental  plan, such as My Vector. 4.3.4.  Assist  mentees  in  assessing  institutional  and  occupational  competencies  to  identify both  strengths  and  areas  for  improvement.    For  additional  information  on  leadership competencies,  reference  AFMAN  36-2647,  Institutional  Competency  Development  and Management. 4.3.5.  Share relevant knowledge, experience, and resources with mentee. 4.3.6.  Identify and help mentee resolve potential issues encountered in development. 4.3.7.  Facilitate opportunities for mentee to gain new experiences and build skills. 4.4.  Performance Standards.  Mentoring activities are to be clearly defined in the employee’s performance standards.  Performance standards describe how the requirements and expectations are to be evaluated. Performance standards are to be written at the “Fully Successful” level. The standards  should  include  specific,  measureable,  achievable,  relevant,  and  timely  criteria,  which provide the framework for developing effective results and expectations. 12 AFI36-817  28 JUNE 2017 Chapter 5 PHASED RETIREE WORK SCHEDULES 5.1.  Hours  of  Duty.  Phased  retirees  are  permitted  to  work  a  maximum  of  forty  (40)  hours during  a  given  bi-weekly  pay  period.    Except  as  otherwise  expressly  provided  in  law  or regulation, a phased retiree is treated like any other employee on a part-time tour of duty. 5.2.  Work Schedule  .  The number of officially established hours per pay period to be worked by an employee in phased retirement status is equal to one-half the number of hours the phased retiree would have been scheduled to work had the phased retiree remained in a full-time work schedule and not elected to enter phased retirement status (i.e., forty (40) hours per pay period). 5.2.1.  With  supervisory  approval,  the  employee  may  participate  in  flexible  or  compressed work schedule program. 5.2.2.  A phased retiree: 5.2.2.1.  Is not permitted to work intermittent pay periods. 5.2.2.2.  Must have an officially established part-time work schedule. (T-0) 5.2.2.3.  Work time must equal forty (40) hours at the end of each bi-weekly pay period to include a minimum of eight (8) hours of mentoring activities (mandatory requirement) unless leave has been approved. (T-1) 5.2.2.4.  Phased  retirees  are  subject  to  the  Fair  Labor  Standards  Act  (FLSA).    Thus, unless they are working an approved alternate work schedule, they are limited to working 8  hours  per  scheduled  workday.    Hours  worked  in  excess  of  the  officially  established part-time  work  schedule  are  subject  to  overtime  rules  and  restrictions  as  identified  in paragraph  5.5.  5.3.  Pay.  The  phased  retiree  receives  half  of  their  gross  pay,  which  is  subject  to  employee withholdings  for  FEHB,  FEGLI,  Federal  Employees  Dental  and  Vision  Program  (FEDVIP), Federal Long Term Care Insurance Program (FLTCIP), Thrift Savings Plan (TSP), Federal and State tax, Social Security and Medicare tax, and CSRS or FERS deductions as appropriate.  The phased retiree also receives half of their retirement annuity from OPM. 5.4.  Leave.  The  employee  maintains  annual  and  sick  leave  balances  and  does  not  receive  a lump sum payment for annual leave upon transition to phased retirement. 5.4.1.  Leave accrual  is  prorated  at  fifty  (50) percent  of the full-time earnings (i.e., four (4) hours of annual leave per pay period; two (2) hours of sick leave per pay period). 5.4.2.  Annual leave ceiling remains unchanged. 5.4.3.  Accrues additional annual and sick leave on a prorated basis in emergency situations requiring the phased retiree to work excess hours. 5.4.4.  The  employee’s  sick  leave  balance  is  not  used  in  the  calculation  of  the  phased retirement  annuity.  The  sick  leave  balance  is  only  utilized  for  service  credit  when  the employee applies for full retirement benefits. AFI36-817  28 JUNE 2017 13 5.5.  Overtime and Compensatory Time.  Phased retirees are generally restricted from working more than 40 hours in a bi-weekly pay period.  However, the Approving Official may order or approve  a  phased  retiree  to  perform  hours  of  work  in  excess  of  their  officially  established schedule in rare and exceptional circumstances meeting ALL of the following conditions: 5.5.1.  The  work  is  necessary  to  respond  to  an  emergency  posing  a  significant,  immediate, and direct threat to life or property; 5.5.2.  The  authorized  agency  official  determines  that  no  other  qualified  employee  is available to perform the required work; 5.5.3.  The  phased  retiree  is  relieved  from  performing  excess  work  as  soon  as  reasonably possible (e.g., by management assignment of work to other employees); and, 5.5.4.  When  an  emergency  situation  can  be  anticipated  in  advance  agency  management should make advance plans to minimize any necessary excess work by the phased retiree. 5.6.  Holidays.  Phased retirees are subject to the same rules as part-time employees with regard to holidays.  In general, they are entitled to a paid holiday if it falls on a scheduled workday but not for a holiday that falls on a scheduled non-workday. 14 AFI36-817  28 JUNE 2017 Chapter 6 EFFECT OF PHASED RETIREMENT 6.1.  Performance  and  Conduct.  A phased retiree is considered a part-time employee, has the same performance and conduct requirements as in regular employment, and retains the same due process rights.  Removal prior to the end of the phased retiree’s time limit agreement could occur due to budget restrictions, performance, or conduct issues under existing workforce authorities. 6.2.  Health and Life Insurance Premiums.  Phased retirees are considered full-time employees for  the  purpose  of  health  (FEHB)  and  life  (FEGLI)  insurance  benefits,  premiums,  and contributions (see 5 CFR §§ 831.1715(a)(1) and 848.205(a)(1) for FEHB premiums; 5 CFR §§ 831.1715(a)(2)  and  848.205(a)(2)  for  FEGLI  premiums).    The  normal  rules  governing  health benefits  premiums  for  part-time  employees  in  5  U.S.C.  8906(b)(3)  do  not  apply.  Phased retirement is not considered a qualifying life event for allowing benefit changes outside of open season. 6.3.  Bargaining  Unit  Status.  Phased retirees are subject  to  the rules under 5 U.S.C.  Chapter 71.    Since  phased  retirees  convert  from  full-time  to  part-time  status,  bargaining  unit  coverage status  depends  on  whether  part-time  employees  are  included  or  excluded  from  the  local bargaining unit description. 6.4.  Bargaining Obligations.  Local collective bargaining obligations are to be fulfilled prior to implementation for bargaining unit employees. 6.5.  Outside  Employment.  Phased  retirees  remain  employees  of  the  Air  Force  in  accordance with  part 2635 of Title  5, Code of Federal  Regulations.  The phased  retiree is bound by  ethics rules and any restrictions on outside employment. 6.6.  Disability  Retirement.  Phased  retirees  may  not  apply  for  disability  retirement  after entering phased retirement. 6.7.  Court Orders  . Phased retirees are responsible for forwarding court orders to OPM.  DANIEL R.
