It defines authority lines,roles, and responsibilities for oversight and implementation of programs and procedures to ensure propercontrols and protection in preserving the integrity of intelligence collection systems. SUMMARY OF REVISIONSThis document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.Establishes requirement for AF development of automated systems for efficiency of SCI security man-agement.  Designates HQ USAF/XOIIS as Cognizant Security Authority for SCI.  Designates HQ USAF/XOIIS, Intelligence Security Division as SCI Security Policy Team, chartered to establish SCI controland release programs for AF.  Establishes one Base, one SSO policy.  Establishes HQ AIA/SO as OPR forcompilation and submission of quarterly intelligence information compromise and security educationtraining reporting.  Discontinues requirement for HAF-IN(Q) 9327, Results of Security ManagementInspection Report. 1. Intelligence information is crucial to an effective Air Force fighting force.  It must be controlled andprotected to preserve the integrity of the intelligence collection system.  Some intelligence informationdesignated as Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) requires additional control and protection.This Directive establishes policy for the control, protection, and dissemination of Air Force intelligenceinformation.2. The Air Force will maintain effective control of the dissemination of intelligence information amongUS intelligence community components, US forces outside the intelligence community requiring theinformation, foreign nationals, foreign governments, and contractors.3. Intelligence information will be secured, handled, and disseminated only by properly designated users.3.1. The Air Force will validate organizations authorized to receive and handle SCI, indoctrinate per-sonnel for access to SCI, and train them to protect against unauthorized disclosures.  In addition, the2AFPD14-3   1 MAY 1998Air Force will maintain SCI facilities and communications capabilities certified to support SCI han-dling.3.2. The Air Force will develop automated systems to sustain efficiency of intelligence security man-agement.3.3. The Air Force will develop procedures to report  compromises of classified intelligence informa-tion or  serious failures to comply with the provisions of security regulations which are likely to resultin compromise.  4. This directive establishes the following responsibilities and authorities:4.1. Director of Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance, DCS/Air and Space Operations, is theAir Force Senior Official of the Intelligence Community (SOIC), responsible for intelligence informa-tion security for the Air Force.4.2. HQ USAF/XOII (Associate Director for Intelligence) is the Air Force authority for issues involv-ing the release of intelligence information.4.2.1. HQ USAF/XOIIS is the Air Force Cognizant Security Authority (CSA) for SCI, the singleprincipal designated by the SOIC to serve as responsible official for SCI security program man-agement.   4.2.2. HQ USAF/XOIIS  will establish intelligence security control and release programs andoversee Major Command (MAJCOM), Field Operating Agency (FOA), and Direct Reporting Unit(DRU), intelligence security programs.  In addition, they will represent the Air Force in nationaland Department of Defense (DoD) intelligence security forums.4.3. Air Force activities will control intelligence information in accordance with governing directivesand report intelligence information security violations to HQ Air Intelligence Agency Security Office(AIA/SO). 4.3.1. Air Force activities will conduct quarterly security awareness training with emphasis onreducing or preventing recurrence of violations.  MAJCOM SSOs will report number of personnelreceiving security education training per quarter to HQ AIA/SO.    HQ AIA/SO will use trainingsatistics to identify and document correlations between security violation trends and the conductsecurity education training.     4.4. The host Major Air Command (MAJCOM) for an installation will ensure SCI communicationsand security management are provided as necessary to support any Air Force unit mission on thatinstallation.  The host command may contract with a tenant organization to provide SCI communica-tions and SCI security management oversight at an Air Force installation for the host command.  Ten-ant organizations will work with the host MAJCOM to ensure there is only one AF SSO perinstallation.  The Air Force Office of Special Investigations will retain a separate SSO to support itscounterintelligence and force protection responsibilities.   4.5. Commanders/Senior Intelligence Officers (SIO) will ensure facilities where intelligence infor-mation is used meet security requirements and that personnel are trained to protect the information.Commanders/Senior Intelligence Officers may enter into agreements (Memorandums Of Agreement)with other United States security organizations to provide or receive security services.  The sharing orconsolidation of security resources and skills required to meet the needs of the participantâ€™s individualgoverning directives is encouraged.AFPD14-3   1 MAY 199834.6. HQ USAF/XOIIS will establish objectives and requirements for the electronic exchange and dis-semination of security and intelligence information through automated security management systems.5. This policy applies to all Air Force activities and personnel who produce, receive, or disseminate intel-ligence information.5.1. Air Force Service Cryptologic Elements will also comply with National Security Agency direc-tives.  Conflicts will be resolved by the Cognizant Security Authorities. 6.

WHITTEN PETERSActing Secretary of the Air Force4AFPD14-3   1 MAY 1998Attachment 1 MEASURING AND DISPLAYING POLICY EFFECTIVENESS A1.1. The Air Force will measure the success of controlling, protecting, and disseminating intelligenceinformation by evaluating the number of intelligence information compromises occurring quarterly .  Thedata will be displayed on bar charts that show the number of certain, probable, or possible compromisesand the category of each compromise.  Analysis will focus on identifying trends in categories of compro-mise.  The objective is to reduce the number of intelligence information compromises.  A1.2. MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs will report all SCI security violations as defined in DoDS5102.21-M-1, Sensitive Compartmented Information Administrative Security Manual, and AFMAN14-304, The Security, Use, and Dissemination of Sensitive Compartmented Information. A1.3. HQ AIA/SO will provide a two-part quarterly report, RCS: HAF-XO(Q) 9326, that identifiestrends in security violations and the impact of  security education and training programs on security vio-lation trends.   Part I:  Compiled data from initial and follow-up security violations reports received fromMAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs.   Part II:  Compiled data reflecting number of individuals receiving  secu-rity education training.  Submit quarterly Intelligence Information Compromise and Security EducationReport to HQ USAF/XOIIS.  This report is designated emergency status code D.  Immediately discon-tinue reporting data requirements during emergency conditions.AFPD14-3   1 MAY 19985Figure A1.1.
