The global lines of latitude and longitude hearken to the original 20th Air Force patch and emphasize the global nature of the Air Force space mission. The thrusts and vectors behind the globe represent the dynamic and infinite space environment. The deltoid symbolizes the Air Force’s upward thrust into space, the reentry  vehicles of our Intercontinental Ballistic Missile  force and the launch vehicles that place satellites in orbit. The ellipses represent orbital paths traced by  satellites  in  earth  orbit;  the  satellites  symbolically  depicted  as  four-pointed  stars. The  symmetric  placement  of  the  satellites  signifies  the  Air  Force’s  worldwide coverage in accomplishing its mission.       BADGE CRITERIA Basic Space Badge will be awarded upon completion of the Enlisted Space Operations (ESO) course and award of the 1C631 specialty code.

This  Career  Field  Education  and  Training  Plan  (CFETP)  is  a  comprehensive  education  and training  document  that  identifies  life-cycle  career  development,  mentoring,  education/training requirements, training support resources, and minimum task requirements for all active duty, and Air  Reserve  Component  (ARC)  [Air  Force  Reserve  and  Air  National  Guard]  members  within this specialty.  Due to the operations diversity within the career field, the use of core tasks does not apply to the 1C6X1 AFSC or this CFETP.  This CFETP will provide personnel a clear career path  to  success  and  will  instill  rigor  in  all  aspects  of  career  field  training.    Note:    Civilians occupying  associated  positions  will  use  Part  II  to  support  duty  position  qualification  training.  Along  with  the  CFETP,  AFI  13-601,  Management  and  Development  of  Enlisted  Personnel  in Space  Systems  Operations,  provides  additional  direction  and  is  available  for  enlisted  space operators and all space leaders.    2.  The CFETP consists  of two parts.  Supervisors use both parts to plan, manage, and  control training within the specialty.    2.1.    Part  I  provides  information  necessary  for  overall  management  of  the  specialty.  Section  A explains  how  everyone  will  use  the  plan;  Section  B  identifies  career  field  progression information,  duties  and  responsibilities,  training  strategies,  and  career  field  path;  Section  C associates  each  level  with  specialty  qualifications  (knowledge,  education,  experience,  training, and other); and Section D indicates resource constraints. Some examples are funds, manpower, equipment, facilities; Section E identifies transition training guide requirements for SSgt through MSgt.    2.2.  Part  II includes the following: Section A identifies the Specialty Training  Standard (STS) and includes duties, tasks, requirements to support training, AETC-conducted training, wartime course  and  core  task,  and  correspondence  course  requirements.  Section  B  contains  the  Course Objective List (COL) and training standards supervisors will use to determine if airmen satisfied training  requirements.  Section  C  identifies  available  support  materials.  An  example  is  a Qualification Training Package, which may be developed to support proficiency training; Section D  identifies  a  training  course  index  supervisors  can  use  to  determine  resources  available  to support  training.  Included  here  are  both  mandatory  and  optional  courses;  Section  E  identifies MAJCOM  unique  training  requirements  supervisors  can  use  to  determine  additional  training required  for  the  associated  qualification  needs.  At  unit  level,  supervisors  and  trainers  will  use Part II to identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan.  2.3.    Using  guidance  provided  in  the  CFETP  will  ensure  individuals  in  this  specialty  receive effective and efficient training at the appropriate points in their career. This plan will enable us to train today's work force for tomorrow's jobs.   For Official Use Only  Page 4 of 97   3.    Training  Decisions.    The  CFETP  uses  a  building  block  approach  (simple  to  complex)  to encompass  the  entire  spectrum  of  training  requirements  for  the  1C6  career  field.  The  spectrum includes  a  strategy  for  when,  where,  and  how  to  meet  the  training  requirements.  The  strategy must  be  apparent  and  affordable  to  reduce  duplication  of  training  and  eliminate  a  disjointed approach to training.   Changes to training courses occur frequently.  Requests to change courses must  be  submitted  by  the  MAJCOM  HQ,  coordinated  with  HQ  Air  Force  Reserve  Command (AFRC) and the National Guard Bureau (NGB), and routed through the AFCFM at the Air Staff to HQ AETC for processing.

A  list  of  JPRs,  the  JPRL  identifies  specific system  tasks  and  subtasks,  and  the  proficiency  levels  required  for  mission  ready  status.    The JPRL  is  broken  down  by  Area/Task/Subtask,  Description,  Units  not  Affected  (when  used  for like-units), and Proficiency Levels A, B, or C (to include constraints, performance and standards as necessary).  JPRLs may  be  written for a specific mission area, a specific system, or  generic enough  to  cover  several  systems.    Unit/system  JPRLs  are  used  to  develop  the  IPOI  and  the Annual Plan of Evaluation (APOE).  Key Developmental Position (KDP).  A KDP is used to complement leadership qualifications. These  positions  are  utilized  to  provide  experience  necessary  for  KLPs  that  may  not  be  gained through the normal assignment system.  Key  Leadership  Position  (KLP).    A  KLP  is  defined  as  a  unique,  “no-fail”  position  with distinguishing responsibilities and education, training, experience, or performance requirements that  cannot  be  realized  through  normal  progression  planning,  and  may  not  be  prevalent  in  the majority of the career field.   Knowledge  Training.    Training  used  to  provide  a  base  of  knowledge  for  task  performance.  It may  also  be  used  in  lieu  of  task  performance  when  the  training  capability  does  not  exist. Learning gained through knowledge rather than hands-on experience.  Master Task List (MTL).  A comprehensive list (100%) of all tasks performed within a work center and consisting of the current CFETP or AFJQS and locally developed AF Forms 797 (as a minimum).  Should include tasks required for deployment and/or UTC requirements.  Mission  Qualification  Training  (MQT).    Also  known  as  OJT  (On-the-Job  Training).  The purpose  of  MQT  is  to  qualify  spacecrew  members  in  assigned  spacecrew  positions  to  perform the command or unit mission.   Master  Training  Plan  (MTP).    Employs  a  strategy  for  ensuring  the  completion  of  all  work center  job  requirements  by  using  a  Master  task  Listing  and  provides  milestones  for  task,  CDC completion, and prioritizes deployment/UTC, HST tasks, upgrade, and qualification tasks.  Mission  Ready  (MR).    This  term  only  applies  to  non-CMR  units.

Conducted every three years for enlisted AFSCs.  On-the-Job Training (OJT).  Hands-on, “over-the-shoulder” conducted to certify personnel in both upgrade (skill level award) and job qualification (position certification training).  For space operations, OJT is also known as MQT.  Plan  of  Instruction  (POI).  The POI is a training  guide outlining how the training program is applied  and  administered.    A  POI  can  be  as  simple  as  a  syllabus  of  day-to-day  events  or  as complex  as  using  Lesson  Plans  and  Student  Study  Guides.    Units  develop  local  methods  that provide verification from both instructors and students that training has been completed.  Position Qualification Training.  Training designed to qualify an Airman in a specific position that occurs after upgrade training.  Proficiency  Training.  Additional training, either in-residence or exportable advanced training courses,  or  on-the-job  training,  provided  to  personnel  to  increase  their  skills  and  knowledge beyond the minimum required for upgrade.  Qualification Training (QT).  Hands-on performance training designed to qualify an Airman in a specific position. This training occurs both during and after upgrade training to maintain up-to- date qualifications.  Ready  Spacecrew  Program  (RSP).    RSP  is  an  overarching  operations  training  program designed  to  enhance  the  knowledge  and  warfighting  capability  of  AFSPC  spacecrew  members after  MQT  and  throughout  a  spacecrew  member’s  tour(s)  in  a  given  MDS.  It  includes  continuation training (CT) and advanced training  (AT) and leverages the Weapons  and Tactics process to continuously develop, test and train innovative warfighting TTPs.  Resource  Constraints.    Resource deficiencies, such  as money,  facilities, time,  manpower,  and equipment that preclude desired training from being delivered.  RSP  Advanced  Training  Mission  (RAM).  RSP  advanced  training  missions  are  designed  to improve a spacecrew’s ability to operate the weapon system under challenging CDO conditions. RAMs will focus on overall mission effectiveness in a CDO environment rather than individual task performance. RAMs are conducted throughout the AT period and are the primary means of achieving AT objectives and currencies.    For Official Use Only  Page 13 of 97  RSP  Tasking  Message  (RTM).    AFSPC  directed  training  that  provides  the  baseline  training requirements  for  use  in  developing  a  realistic  training  program  tailored  to  operational  space squadron requirements.  Space  Mission  Forces  (SMF).    Akin  to  the  Air  Expeditionary  Force,  the  SMF  is  a  long-term overarching  initiative  to  prepare  and  present  space  forces,  primarily  those  operating  from garrison, as a ready force capable of operating in a contested, degraded and operationally limited (CDO) environment.  Space  Mission  Task  Force  (SMTF).    The  Air  Force’s  space  mission  force  presented  to CDRUSSTRATCOM  for  operational  use.  It  is  based  on  the  Air  Expeditionary  Task  Force (AETF)  concept,  but  acknowledges  most  space  forces  perform  operations  from  CONUS.  The SMTF uses Unit Type Codes as building blocks to aggregate the force. This force includes space operators,  mission  planning  personnel,  intelligence  professionals,  space  weapon  systems  and other necessary equipment.  Space  Professional  (SP).    Total  population  supporting  the  overall  DoD  space  effort.    SP includes all functional communities supporting space (operations, acquisition, communications, maintenance, weather, logistics, intelligence, security, etc.).

An  AF-level  personnel  development program designed to build space experts who thoroughly understand the medium of space--from concept  to  sustainment--including  design,  acquisition,  fielding,  operations,  maintenance.    The SPDP is a multi-faceted plan to ensure deliberate, purposeful individual development highlighted by expanded space education, training, and experience-building opportunities.  The elements of this program are formalized through a three-level certification program to create and manage a knowledgeable  community  of  SPs  to  meet  the  nation’s  space  needs  and  national  security objectives.  SPDP is the official AF response to the 2001 Space Commission’s recommendation to “develop the space cadre the nation needs.”    Specialty Training.  The total training process used to qualify airmen in their assigned specialty.  Specialty Training Requirements Team (STRT).  The primary purpose of the STRT is for the AFCFM  and  functional  leaders  to  determine  and  present  training  requirements  to  the  AETC Training Pipeline Manager (TPM) and AETC Course Training Manager (TM).  Specialty Training Standard (STS).  An AF publication that describes an AFS in terms of tasks and knowledge an Airman in that specialty may be expected to perform or to know on the job.

This is an executive decision meeting.   For Official Use Only  Page 16 of 97  Section A - General Information  1.    Purpose.    This  CFETP  provides  the  information  necessary  for  AFCFMs,  MFMs, commanders, training managers, supervisors and trainers to plan, develop, manage, and conduct an effective and efficient career field training program.  The plan outlines the training individuals in this AFS should receive in order to develop and progress throughout their career.  This plan identifies  initial  skills,  upgrade,  qualification,  advanced  and  proficiency  training.    Initial  skills training  is  the  AFS  specific  training  an  individual  receives  upon  entry  into  the  AF  or  upon retraining into this specialty for award of the 3-skill level.  This training is conducted by AETC at  the  technical  training  center  located  at  Vandenberg  Air  Force  Base.  AFSC  upgrade  training identifies  the  mandatory  courses,  task  qualification  requirements,  and  correspondence  course completion requirements for award of the 3-, 5-, 7-, 9-skill level.  Qualification training is actual hands-on  task  performance  training  designed  to  qualify  an  Airman  in  a  specific  duty  position.  This training program occurs both during and after the upgrade training process.  It is designed to provide  the  performance  skills  and  knowledge  required  to  do  the  job.    Advanced  training  is formal  specialty  training  used  for  selected  airmen.    Proficiency  training  is  additional  training, either  in-residence  or  exportable  advanced  training  courses,  or  on-the-job  training  provided  to personnel to increase their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required for upgrade . The CFETP has several purposes—some are:  1.1.  Serves  as  a  management  tool  to  plan,  manage,  conduct,  and  evaluate  career  field  training programs.    It  is  used  to  help  supervisors  identify  training  at  the  appropriate  point  in  an individual's career.  1.2.  Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in the specialty and recommends education and training throughout each phase of an individual’s career.  1.3.  Lists  training  courses  available  in  the  specialty,  identifies  sources  of  training,  and  the training delivery method.  1.4.  Identifies  major  resource  constraints  that  impact  full  implementation  of  the  desired  career field training process.  2.  Uses.  The plan will be used by MFMs and supervisors at all levels to ensure comprehensive and cohesive training programs are available for each individual in the specialty.  It is maintained by the specialty AFCFM.  The AFCFM leads a formal review of the CFETP during the U&TW or at a career field management conference to ensure currency and accuracy.  Identified changes are  forwarded  to  AETC  by  the  AFCFM.    MAJCOMs  must  not  create  training  programs  that duplicate  training  provided  by  existing  AETC  courses.    This  plan  will  be  used  at  all  levels  of training (where applicable) to ensure a comprehensive and cohesive training program is available and instituted for each individual in the career ladder.  2.1.   AETC training personnel will develop or revise formal resident, nonresident and exportable training  based  on  requirements  established  by  the  users,  validated  by  the  AFCFM,  and documented  in  the  Part  II  of  the  CFETP.    The  using  command  and  AETC  will  work  with  the   For Official Use Only  Page 17 of 97  AFCFM  to  develop  procurement  and  acquisition  strategies  to  obtain  resources  necessary  to provide the identified training.  2.2.  MFMs  will  ensure  their  training  programs  complement  the  CFETP  mandatory  initial, upgrade,  and  proficiency  requirements.  OJT,  resident  training,  and  contract  training  or exportable courses can satisfy identified requirements. MAJCOM-developed training to support this AFSC must be identified for inclusion into the plan.  2.3. Individual BMR/CMR certification is not linked to skill level award for the 1C6X1 AFSC.  However, each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in the Air Force  Enlisted  Classification  Directory  (AFECD)  and  AFI  36-2201  for  award  of  3-,  5-,  and  7- skill levels.  The list of courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training.  3.  Coordination and Approval.  The AFCFM is the approval authority. Also, the AFCFM will initiate  an  annual  review  of  this  document  to  ensure  currency  and  accuracy.  MAJCOM representatives  and  AETC  training  personnel  will  identify  and  coordinate  on  the  career  field training requirements. Using the list of courses in Part II, they will eliminate duplicate training.    For Official Use Only  Page 18 of 97  Section B - Career Field Progression and Information  1.

Authorized Duty Titles for Enlisted Personnel in Space Systems Operations.   To comply with  AFI  36-2618,  Enlisted  Force  Structure,  Chapter  7,  the  following  are  the  only  authorized duty  titles  for  the  1C6X1  career  field.    When  properly  applied,  duty  titles  facilitate  a  quick understanding  of  a  person’s  role  and  level  of  responsibility.    Standardized  duty  titles  support purposeful and deliberate development of space systems operations Airmen and are required to meet  the  CSAF’s  vision  of  mentoring  via  Enlisted  Developmental  Teams.    Enlisted  duty  titles will  be  assigned  based  upon  scope  of  responsibility  and  the  preponderance  of  duties  being performed.    A  consistent,  standard  approach  is  important  to  ensure  the  terms  are  meaningful.  Higher  fidelity  delineation  within  duties,  specific  missions,  systems,  roles  and  responsibilities will be distinguished through tailorable unit-derived duty descriptions, with unique experiences codified  via  Special  Experience  Identifiers  (SEI).    Deviations  from  or  alterations  made  to   For Official Use Only  Page 22 of 97  authorized  duty  titles  will  prevent  experiences  from  being  accurately  represented  in  Air  Force professional development  tools and databases.   The authority to waive adherence to authorized duty titles for the 1C6X1 specialty is the AFCFM.    4.2.1.  Figure 4.2. (Authorized Duty Titles for Enlisted Personnel in Space Systems Operations) depicts appropriate duty titles for each grade.

Space  education  does  not  end  at  the  ESO course.    Space  professional  development  is  a  continual  lifecycle  of  education  and  progressive experience  management  spread  throughout  a  space  systems  operator’s  career.    Development hinges on three areas: depth of experience, breadth of experience, and education and training, as depicted  in  Figure  5.1.  (Development  Matrix  for  Enlisted  Personnel  in  Space  Systems Operations).    Figure 5.1. Development Matrix for Enlisted Personnel in Space Systems Operations.   learning  professional  education  and  5.1.1.  Supplemental Space Education and Training.   1C6X1 personnel are offered a variety of in-resident,  correspondence,  and  distance training opportunities  (on  and  off  duty)  to  gain  breadth  and  depth,  maintain  a  high  degree  of  subject matter  expertise,  and  supplement  perishable  knowledge  and  skills.    Education  and  training opportunities include self-study of technical orders, professional papers, computer-based training offerings, etc.  5.1.2.    Formal  Education  and  Training  Delivery  Plan.    Figure  5.2.  (1C6  Formal  Education  and Training  Delivery  Plan)  illustrates  the  progression  of  in-resident  and  correspondence  formal instruction.  Following completion of the ESO course, 1C6X1 personnel are developed for both mission  depth  and  space  enterprise  depth.    Space  systems  operations  personnel  require  an intricate  understanding  of  the  weapon  system(s)  they  employ  and  the  mission(s)  they  directly   For Official Use Only  Page 25 of 97  support,  as  well  as  a  broad  perspective  of  the  collective  relationships  and  effects  of  the  space enterprise.      Figure 5.2. 1C6 Formal Education and Training Delivery Plan.  5.2.    Space  Education.    The  foundation  for  SP  development  is  a  continuum  of  educational courses.  These  courses  are intended to advance  the knowledge of officer, enlisted and civilian SPs.  The courses bring  members together at key increments in their careers to  stay  current on evolving space missions, technologies and capabilities, and to further professional relationships.          5.2.1.  Enlisted Space Operations (ESO) Course.  The ESO course is taught to personnel (usually accessions)  to  give  them  a  foundation  in  space  fundamentals  and  indoctrinate  them  into  this unique “space culture.” It provides core career field training and the basic knowledge needed to perform  the  duties  associated  with  the  space  systems  operations  career  field.    The  ESO  course includes an initial background in technical information in orbital mechanics, space environment, communications,  sensor  fundamentals,  organizations,  and  history.  The  students  receive instruction in: Missile Warning, Satellite Command and Control, Space Control, Spacelift/Range operations, and Space Surveillance.  After graduation from the ESO course, students will receive more specific mission area training (MQT) at their gaining unit, with the length of the training dependent  upon  the  weapon  system  trained.    This  course  is  part  of  the  Space  Professional Development concept. Graduation from IST results in award of the 1C631 AFSC.  ESO training is conducted by 381 TRG, Vandenberg AFB, CA.    5.2.2.    Ready  Spacecrew  Program  (RSP).    RSP  is  the  overarching  operations  training  program designed  to  enhance  the  knowledge  and  warfighting  capability  of  AFSPC  spacecrew  members   For Official Use Only  Page 26 of 97  after  MQT  and  throughout  a  spacecrew  member’s  tour(s)  in  a  given  MDS.    It  includes continuation  training  (CT)  and  advanced  training  (AT)  and  may  include  difference  training  as required.  5.2.2.1.  Advanced Training (AT).  Advanced Training is the set of formal training requirements, beyond  weapon  system  qualification  and  CT  to  advance  the  skills  required  to  ensure  mission accomplishment  in  a  Contested,  Degraded,  and  Operationally-limited  (CDO)  environment.  Advanced  Training  is  the  most  important  part  of  the  RSP  for  AFSPC  CMR  units.    Mission Planning, Execution, and Debriefing are critical to successful AT. Non-CMR units will adapt AT as necessary to meet mission needs.  5.2.2.1.1.  Weapon System Technical Knowledge.  Develop in-depth, technical  knowledge and skills,  to  the  sub-system  level,  on  individual  weapon  systems  and  their  associated  support infrastructure (ex. system architecture, capabilities, limitations, vulnerabilities, etc.).  5.2.2.1.2.    CDO  Challenges  to  Mission  Success.    Develop  comprehensive  knowledge  of  CDO challenges  threatening  mission  success.    Training  should  cover  the  following  topics  at  a minimum:  adversary  threats  and  systems,  adversary  doctrine,  adversary  tactics,  environmental impacts, and system degradation.  5.2.2.1.3.  Weapon System Employment TTPs.  Create in-depth knowledge and skills necessary to develop and employ weapon system capabilities to achieve current and emerging tactical and operational  objectives  under  a  wide  range  of  operating  environments  and  threat  conditions.  Training  should  allow  and  encourage  the  identification  and  initial  development  of  new employment TTP.  5.2.2.1.4.  Defensive TTPs.  Demonstrate ability  to overcome adversary  attempts to undermine mission success (ex. defensive capabilities, etc.) to the extent possible for the system.  Training should allow and encourage the identification and initial development of new defensive TTP.  5.2.2.1.5.    System  and  Operational  Integration.    Demonstrate  ability  to  effectively  and  rapidly integrate  operations  with  external  organizations  (Joint  Space  Operations  Center,  Air  and  Space Operations  Center  (AOC),  Space  Operations  Squadrons,  etc.).    Develop  comprehensive understanding of the broad impacts of CDO events to current and future supported missions (ex. Command  and  Control  relationships,  Operation  Orders,  crisis  action  planning,  theater commander and/or end-user requirements, AOC integration, etc.).  5.2.2.2.    RSP  Advanced  Training  Missions  (RAMs).    RSP  advanced  training  missions  are designed to improve a spacecrew’s ability to operate the weapon system under challenging CDO conditions.  RAMs will focus on overall mission effectiveness in a CDO environment rather than individual  task  performance.    RAMs  are  conducted  throughout  the  AT  period  and  are  the primary means of achieving AT objectives and currencies.  5.2.2.3.  The Comprehensive Task List (CTL) specifies what tasks are to be performed by each crew  position  and  to  what  level  the  task  should  be  understood  or  performed.    The  CTL  may specify different levels by experience level as required.   For Official Use Only  Page 27 of 97   5.2.3.  Education and Training for Types of Work.  1C6X1 professionals are offered education and  training  opportunities  that  are  targeted  for  application  in  specific  “types  of  work.”    Figure 5.2.  (Development  Matrix  for  Enlisted  Personnel  in  Space  Systems  Operations)  illustrates  the relationships  between  award  criteria  for  the  Space  Operations  Badge,  skill  levels,  training  and education opportunities and prerequisites, and Space Professional Development Program tiers.  5.2.3.1.    NSSI/RNSSI.    NSSI/RNSSI  is  the  DoD’s  single  focal  point  for  space  education  and training,  complementing  existing  space  education  programs  at  the  Air  University  and  the  Air Force  Institute  of  Technology.    The  cornerstone  of  SPDP  is  a  space  education  continuum  of learning (CoL) that reinforces space cultural awareness throughout a space professional’s career.  These courses are intended to advance the space knowledge of all officers, enlisted and civilian space professionals. https://www2.peterson.af.mil/nssi/public/   5.2.3.1.1.  Space 200.  Space 200 is usually taught to NCOs and SNCOs whose duties focus on the operational environment, the design and acquisition of space systems, and the integration of space  capabilities  into  joint  warfighting.    This  is  a  mid-career  course  for  space  professional continuing education.  It develops space professionals to think critically about the application of space power.

Air  Force  Institute  of  Technology  (AFIT).    The  Enlisted–to–AFIT  program  is  a  unique element  of  enlisted  space  professional  development.    In  conjunction  with  other  training  and education  programs,  resident  AFIT-sponsored  science,  engineering,  and  management  graduate degree  opportunities  further  develop  NCO  and  senior  noncommissioned  officers'  (SNCO) technical education and skills.  Applicants for advanced academic degrees are limited to specific AFSCs.  The 1C6X1 specialty is an approved AFSC for the AFIT Space Systems degree and the Systems Engineering degree programs.  6.  Professional Development  6.1.  Tactical Development (E-1 to E-7, Years 1 - 15).  During the initial phase enlisted Space Professionals (SP) should focus on developing depth in their assigned space system.  It is critical to acquire technical depth and knowledge breadth that will be built upon during an entire career.  The  primary  focus  is  on  becoming  a  systems  expert,  but  SPs  must  also  understand  when  key career  milestones  need  to  be  accomplished.    Communication  is  essential  during  this  phase.  Supervisors  and  mentors  must  understand  many  elements  of  the  space  enterprise  in  order  to provide feedback, evaluate strengths and weaknesses, and discuss career path options.  6.1.1.  Education.  Basic Military Training is followed by ESO, the first stage in the continuum of  space  education.    After  completing  Combat  Mission  Ready  (CMR)  certification  and  Career Development  Courses  (CDCs),  SPs  should  visit  the  base  education  office  to  determine  the amount  of  Community  College  of  the  Air  Force  (CCAF)  course  credit  they’ve  already  earned and the additional coursework they need to complete for a CCAF associate degree.  Continuous learning  is  necessary  throughout  an  enlisted  SP’s  career,  so  a  long-term  education  plan  is invaluable.  6.1.2.  Training.  Following the ESO course, operators attend training in their assigned weapon system.    Depending  on  the  complexity  of  the  system,  this  process  may  take  several  months.  After  attaining  CMR  status,  enlisted  SPs  are  immediately  enrolled  in  the  appropriate  CDCs  to increase their AF skill level.  Mission ready monthly recurring training may also be required.  In some  cases,  commanders  may  direct  ASOpS  advanced  course  attendance  within  a  particular mission area.  6.1.3.    Experience.    The  primary  driver  for  enlisted  assignments  is  mission  requirements.  Depending  on  mission  needs,  a  typical  airman  may  have  three  to  four  assignments  during  this   For Official Use Only  Page 32 of 97  development  phase  in  several  different  weapon  systems  and/or  mission  areas.    Therefore, personnel are expected to deepen their system experience through opportunities in the following positions:  line instructors, line evaluators, operational support staff, operational group evaluation positions  or  formal  instructor  duties.    When  the  assignment  process  allows,  SPs  should  also volunteer for positions that build on their mission depth.  Some examples:  6.1.3.1.    Complement  ground-based  missile  warning  experience  with  an  operational  tour  in  a space-based warning squadron.    6.1.3.2.  After a space surveillance assignment at the 20 SPCS, deepen this experience with an assignment to the JSpOC.   6.1.3.3.  After an assignment in the 50th Space Wing, move to the 460th Space Wing to deepen satellite systems experience with a space-based warning (systems) assignment.    6.2.    Operational  and  Integration  Development  (E-5  to  E-8,  Years  6  -  18).    In  this  stage  of development,  enlisted  SPs  transition  to  first  line  supervisor  and  mid-level  leadership  and management positions.  There are still opportunities for building tactical depth in crew positions, but  most  mid-level  NCOs  are  expected  to  broaden  their  experience  as  crew  chiefs  or  Non Commissioned  Officers  in  Charge  (NCOICs).    One  aspect  that  hasn’t  changed  is  job performance, which is still the most important factor in determining future progression.  6.2.1.  Education.  At this point, individuals are encouraged to complete their CCAF degree and consider enrolling in a bachelor’s degree or graduate-level program.  A STEM degree related to the space profession would be the most beneficial.  Space 200, Space 300 may be appropriate at this  time  to  prepare  an  enlisted  SP  to  integrate  space  capabilities.    The  AFIT  Graduate  Space Systems  degree  program  is  another  option  for  members  with  the  appropriate  prerequisites  to consider.    6.2.2.    Training.    Applicable  advanced  courses  (ASOpS)  may  be  appropriate  at  this  time  to support  technical  development  in  a  mission  area  or  weapon  system.    Advanced  courses  should complement the type of  work being performed and is optimally attended before or  early in the related assignment to realize the greatest return on the training investment.  6.2.3.  Experience.  The depth of experience gained as a technician is in very high demand.  SPs serve as subject matter experts, and in mid-level staff and leadership roles.  Deep understanding of  weapon  system  capabilities  and  mission  execution  is  expected  from  crew  chiefs  and  when serving in other key NCOIC positions.  Many opportunities outside the tactical unit are available that  can  continue  to  deepen  as  well  as  broaden  space  experience,  such  as:  instructor/evaluator duty at squadron, group, ESO, NSSI/RNSSI, and ASOpS; mission or enterprise expert at an Air Operations  Center,  experimentation  squadron,  aggressor  or  range  squadron,  or  operational test/evaluation  organization,  etc;  and  staff  positions  at  group,  wing,  Numbered  Air  Force,  or MAJCOM.  Joint  experiences  also  provide  unique  operational-level  perspectives  that  help develop  a  more  complete  portfolio  for  the  SP.    Adding  an  additional  mission  area  if  multiple assignments have been spent in a singular area is also an excellent way to broaden understanding of the space enterprise.  These positions help develop staff skills, the ability to apply expertise to   For Official Use Only  Page 33 of 97  space  issues  at  higher  levels,  and  expand  one’s  knowledge  and  perspective  of  the  space enterprise.    6.3.  Strategic Development (E-7 and above, Years 12 and higher).  In this stage of development, senior  enlisted  SPs  apply  the  depth  and  breadth  of  experience  gained  in  previous  phases, combined  with  leadership  and  management  skills.    These  individuals  compete  for  key developmental  and  key  leadership  positions  and  other  advisory  roles  within  squadrons,  groups and  wings,  or  serve  as  key  staff  members  throughout  the  space  enterprise  and/or  across  the greater Air Force institution.   6.3.1.    Education.    By  this  point,  enlisted  SPs  will  have  completed  their  CCAF  degree. Individuals  are  encouraged  to  consider  enrolling  in  a  bachelor’s  degree  or  graduate-level program.  A STEM degree related to the space profession would be the most beneficial.  Space 200,  Space  300  may  be  appropriate  at  this  time  to  prepare  an  enlisted  SP  to  integrate  space capabilities.  The AFIT Graduate Space Systems degree program is another option for members with the appropriate prerequisites to consider.  6.3.2.    Training.    Applicable  advanced  courses  (ASOpS)  may  be  appropriate  at  this  time  to support  technical  development  in  a  mission  area  or  weapon  system.    Advanced  courses  should complement the type of  work being performed and is optimally attended before or  early in the related assignment to realize the greatest return on the training investment.  6.3.3.    Experience.    SPs  apply  their  skills  to  serve  as  a  squadron  flight  chief,  squadron superintendent, group superintendent, MAJCOM Functional Manager, or Air Force Career Field Manager, etc.  6.4.    Enlisted  Professional  Military  Education  (EPME).    EPME  consists  of  resident  and  non-resident/distance learning (DL) courses for ALS, NCOA and AFSNCOA to prepare Airmen for increased  responsibilities  associated  with  promotion.    Figure  6.1.  (The  Continuum  of  Enlisted Professional Military Education) conveys the blended EPME learning and Time in Service (TIS) model.    Reference  AFI  36-2301,  Developmental  Education,  and/or  the  Air  University  Catalog and  Education catalog (https://etca.randolph.af.mil) for course descriptions and additional details on DL programs.  See also Table 12-1, Enlisted Professional Development Path.  6.4.1.  Airman Leadership School (ALS).  Airmen will first attend ALS between 3 and 6 years of TIS.    ALS  is  an  in-residence  experience  that  prepares  our  SrA  for  leadership  and  supervisory responsibilities.   6.4.2.  NCOA Distance Learning (DL) Course.  Once members have graduated ALS and reached the 7 year TIS point, they will receive notification to enroll in the NCOA DL Course to satisfy Basic EPME requirements.  Airmen must enroll and complete the distance learning course within 12 months to be eligible for promotion and reenlistment.  The course addresses the declarative and  procedural  knowledge  required  to  establish  a  foundation  for  continued  development  in  the NCOA  Intermediate  Leadership Experience (ILE) taught at OCONUS/CONUS  NCOAs.  After and  Training  Course  Announcement (ETCA) online   For Official Use Only  Page 34 of 97  successfully completing the NCOA DL Course, many NCOs will attend the NCOA ILE resident experience between 8 and 14 years TIS.    6.4.3.  NCOA Intermediate Leadership Experience (ILE).  ILE is a Comprehensive level EPME course designed to prepare junior enlisted Airmen to be adaptable, ethical and willing to execute assigned leadership responsibilities to overcome current and future leadership and management challenges  in  order  to  effectively  operate  in  complex  and  ambiguous  environments.    Students apply  their  understanding  of  concepts  covered  in  the  distance-learning  and  additional  concepts covered during the resident course to situations each will likely encounter after graduation.  The ILE prepares NCOs for increased leadership responsibility in their operating environment.  6.4.4.  SNCOA DL Course.  NCOs at 12 years TIS will also receive a notification to enroll and complete  the  current  SNCOA  DL  Course  within  12  months  or  be  ineligible  for  promotion  and reenlistment.  The distance learning course prepares NCOs/SNCOs for leadership responsibilities and  provides  the  foundational  knowledge  for  success  in  the  SNCOA  Advanced  Leadership Experience (ALE).  After successfully completing the SNCOA DL Course, SNCOs may attend the SNCOA ALE when they reach at least 13 but no more than 21 years TIS.   6.4.5.    SNCOA  Advanced  Leadership  Experience  (ALE).    ALE  provides  comprehensive education to prepare senior enlisted to be adaptable, ethical, critically thinking, and strategically relevant  leaders  in  diverse  operating  environments.    Students  apply  their  understanding  of concepts  covered  in  the  distance-learning  course  as  well  as  additional  concepts  covered  during the resident course to situations each will likely encounter after graduation.  The ALE prepares SNCOs  for  increased  leadership  responsibility  in  the  joint,  combined,  and  interagency operating/strategic environment.   6.4.6.  Chief’s Leadership Course (CLC).  CLC is the Air Force EPME capstone.  It is attended upon  promotion  to  Chief  Master  Sergeant  and  enhances  the  senior  enlisted  leader’s  strategic perspective  in  preparation  for  assuming  roles  and  responsibilities  requiring  a  comprehensive mastery of Air Force institutional competencies.    For Official Use Only  Page 35 of 97    Figure 6.1.  The Continuum of Enlisted Professional Military Education  6.4.7.    Enlisted  Joint  PME  (EJPME).    All  enlisted  personnel  should  be  exposed  to  EJPME  as they progress through their respective Services’ EPME system.  This exposure prepares them to succeed  in  the  complex  future  operating  environment  by  improving  their  ability  to  operate effectively  as  part  of  a  Joint  Force.    Some  senior  enlisted  personnel  may  require  a  more comprehensive  joint  education  to  prepare  them  for  an  assignment  to  a  joint  billet  at  the Senior Enlisted  Leader/CSEL  level.    EJPME  includes  four  educational  levels  that  span  an  enlisted member’s career and apply to all enlisted personnel.  Figure 6.2. (Enlisted Professional Military Education  Continuum)  depicts  how  EJPME  progressively  develops  the  knowledge,  skills, perspectives,  and  values  essential  for  enlisted  personnel  to  function  effectively  in  joint, interagency, and multinational operations and organizations.

Enlisted Professional Military Education Continuum  For Official Use Only  Page 37 of 97   6.5.    Continuing  Education.    Throughout  their  careers,  SPs  should  pursue  ongoing  continuing education to keep current on key developments in the space arena, as well as within their areas of expertise.    Professional  reading,  participation  in  space  seminars  and  symposia,  research, specialized courses and advanced degree studies are excellent means of sustaining SP knowledge in space subject areas.     6.6.  Career Paths.  To sum up enlisted guidance, sample career paths are provided in Figure 6.3 (1C6X1 Space Mission Area Depth Pyramid) and Figure 6.4 (Example 1C6X1 Career Pyramid).  These  are  merely  examples  and  do  not  imply  the  existence  of  any  ideal  career  path.    All  SP members  are  strongly  encouraged  to  work  with  a  mentor  in  building  an  achievable  timeline based  on  their  own  goals  and  circumstances.    When  diagramming  a  20+  year  career,  it  might seem a bit intimidating to consider all the important milestones that must be accomplished.      For Official Use Only  Page 38 of 97  6.6.1.

SEIs  support  force  management.    They  are  established when  identifying  space  systems  operations  training,  skills  or  experience  as  critical  to  matching the right skills to the right place at the right time.  SEIs related to each space operations mission area  and  level  of  responsibility  are  used  to  rapidly  identify  an  already  experienced  resource  to meet unique circumstances, contingency requirements or management needs.  They also provide a means to track individuals and identify positions requiring or providing unique experience or training that would otherwise be difficult to locate or identify.  SEIs will be managed IAW AFI 36-2101,  (Classifying  Military  Personnel).    SEIs  have  been  established  in  the  AFECD  for  the space systems operations specialty.

The focus of SPDP is to develop, through individual career management, a group of Space Professionals (SP) with a thorough understanding of the space medium and its effective application to joint warfighting.  SPDP’s goal is to build SPs who are skilled and knowledgeable in  the  development,  application  and  integration  of  space  concepts,  doctrine  and  capabilities  to achieve national security objectives.  Every aspect of this program addresses one or more of the “space  experience”  deficiencies  identified  in  the  2001  report  by  “The  Commission  to  Assess United States National Security Space Management and Organization.”    8.1.1.  The core of SPDP consists of five main elements:  8.1.1.1.  A continuum of space education spread throughout each SP’s career.  8.1.1.2.  Appropriate training for the SP’s duty position.  8.1.1.3.  Experience coding based on SPECs.  8.1.1.4.    A  database  system  that  tracks  individual  space-relevant  experience,  education,  and training milestones, space billet requirements and provides data for metrics on the state of Space Pros (SP) and SPDP effectiveness.   8.1.1.5.  A certification program that merges education, training and experience to establish three distinct levels of space expertise.  8.2.  SPDP Certification.  There are three levels of SPDP Certification, appropriately tailored for officers, enlisted and civilian personnel serving on active duty or in the ARC.  SPs progress from   For Official Use Only  Page 46 of 97  a foundation of technical competency (Level 1), through demonstrated depth of knowledge and experience  in  application  (Level  2),  to  extensive  knowledge  and  experience  in  space  and warfighting operations (Level 3).  Criteria for the various levels are tied to the three fundamental characteristics of AF personnel development--education, training and experience.   8.2.1.  Level 1 Certification Requirements.  Enlisted UST, current in position/CMR, one year of space experience, present Space Pro Certification Brief.  8.2.2.  Level 2 Certification Requirements.  5-skill level, at least one of the following: Space 200, Advanced  Space  Operations  course,  or  award  of  the  Air  &  Space  Operations  Technology (4VAS)  Community  College  of  the  Air  Force  (CCAF)  degree;  current  in  position,  6  years  of experience in space billets.  8.2.3.  Level 3 Certification Requirements.  7-skill level, Space 300 or a Bachelor Degree with a Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics (STEM) major; current in position, 10 years of experience in space billets.  9.  Strategy for Training, Education, Expertise and Professional Development (STEEP).    9.1.    Purpose.    The  strategy’s  goals  are  to:  deliberately  develop  technical  depth  and  breadth through  space  training,  education  and  experience;  instill  an  operational  understanding  of  how space  capabilities  are  best  woven  into  joint  warfare;  cultivate  a  space  warfighter  culture;  and equip  the  specialty  to  strategically  integrate  capabilities  into  joint  warfighting  and  intelligence operations.    STEEP  executes  force  development  by  connecting  training,  education,  and experience  opportunities  to  build  and  enhance  institutional,  occupational,  and  cross-functional competencies in individual Airmen.  It establishes a professional development model based on a combination  of  exposures,  experiences,  and  expertise  over  the  career  of  a  1C6X1,  and  directly supports  enterprise  and  institutional  force  development  programs  that  ensure  we  have  the  right person,  with  the  right  education  and  training,  in  the  right  job,  at  the  right  time  in  their  career.  See Figure 9.1. (Strategy for Training, Education, Expertise and Professional Development).  9.1.1.  Continuum of Learning.  Continuously developing current and future leaders is critical to achieving  the  Air  Force  mission.    This  requires  ongoing  occupational  skills  and  institutional competencies  development,  which  serve  as  the  building  blocks  for  developing  leaders.    The Continuum guides institutional competency development and:  9.1.1.1.    Provides  a  roadmap  for  development  through  education,  training,  and  experiential opportunities   9.1.1.2.

Synchronizes institutional leadership development programs  9.1.2.  Training.  AF training includes the following categories and is many times linked directly to the job, required by law or governance (and therefore, used AF wide) or is needed to boost a skill  set  or  deployment  activity.    AFI  36-2201,  AF  Training  Program,  is  the  instruction  for training programs across the AF.  9.1.2.1.  Ancillary Training  9.1.2.2.  Computer-based and on-line training   9.1.2.3.  Career Field Training  9.1.2.4.  Supplemental Training  9.1.3.    Education.    One  of  the  three  major  components  of  Force  Development  is  education.  Education programs will help prepare you to successfully do your job and to be able to anticipate and meet challenges across the range of military operations.  Look to the Continuum of Learning and  work  with  your  leadership  to  plan  and  execute  how  to  capitalize  on  the  educational opportunities available to you.  Many programs available are tied to career field and occupational development.  9.1.3.1.    Tactical  level  development  programs  are  designed  to  ensure  you  are  qualified  to perform primary duties and begin the process of developing leadership skills.   9.1.3.2.    Operational  level  development  is  designed  to  increase  occupational  qualifications  and mature individual leadership skills.   9.1.3.3. improvement and growth in the highest level of leadership.  9.1.4.    Experience.    Gaining  expertise  comes  from  the  active  participation/involvement  in positions,  events  or  activities  leading  to  the  accumulation  of  knowledge  or  skill  which  can  be utilized  to  meet  mission  requirements.    Experience  at  all  levels  includes  development  gained through an appropriate series of job assignments.  9.1.5.  Professional Development.  Professional development programs provide  the nation with personnel skilled in the employment of air, space and cyberspace power in the conduct of war, small  scale  contingencies,  deterrence,  peacetime  operations,  and  national  security;  provide USAF personnel with the skills and knowledge to make sound decisions in progressively more demanding  leadership  positions  within  the  national  security  environment;  and  to  develop strategic  thinkers,  planners  and  warfighters.    In  addition,  professional  development  programs strengthen the ability and skills of AF personnel to lead, manage and supervise.  See also Table 12-1 (Enlisted Professional Development Path).

The  SBM  program  identifies  unique  1C6X1  mission positions  at  the  7-  and  9-skill  levels  requiring  a  minimum  amount  of  technical  depth  within  a space  operations  mission  area  or  operational  breadth  across  the  space  enterprise.    Figure  9.2. (1C6X1 Space Battle Manager Development Matrix) illustrates notional SBM tracks.  9.2.1.  Enlisted space systems operators may be manually awarded the SBM SEIs upon meeting the requirements established in the AFECD for the space systems operations specialty IAW AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel.   9.2.2.    SBM  SEIs  are  built  upon  other  mission  related  SEIs  and  advanced  education/training.  1C6X1  personnel  awarded  the  SBM  SEI  may  be  assigned  to  positions  requiring  a  minimum number of prior experiences/exposures in the mission area.   9.2.3.    Graduated  SBM  (second  tier)  SEIs  are  built  upon  associated  SBM  experience  and advanced education/training.  1C6X1 personnel awarded these SEIs may be assigned to positions requiring prior experience as a SBM in the mission area.

When compatible to Air Force needs, career-minded Airmen should serve in a variety of duty positions that support the professional development of not only  themselves, but those they serve.    11.2.  Mentoring.  Mentoring is an inherent responsibility of supervision and leadership and is an essential  ingredient  in  developing  well-rounded,  professional  and  competent  future  leaders.  Mentors  are  advisors  and  guides  who  share  knowledge,  experiences,  and  advice  in  helping mentees  achieve  their  career  goals.    Space  professionals  are  encouraged  to  be  and  to  actively seek  mentors  both  internal  and  external  to  their  chain  of  command.    Follow  instructions  for mentoring provided in AFMAN 36-2643, Air Force Mentoring Program.   11.2.1.    MyVECTOR.    The  Air  Force  uses  the  MyVECTOR  web-based  career  planning  and force development tool for all Airmen (Officer, Enlisted, Guard and Reserve).  MyVECTOR is an  enterprise  solution  that  supports  the  Air  Force's  goal  to  provide  a  standardized  process available  to  all  Airmen  for  career  development  and  mentoring.  Airmen  can  be  proactive  about their career development and mentoring relationships.  11.2.1.1.  Mentoring.  MyVECTOR enables a web-based mentoring network that allows mentees to manage their career development with the input and guidance from a mentor.  Mentees will be able to, in real-time, invite participants to serve as mentors, select mentors based on preferences, chat  with  their  mentor  online,  and  complete  a  mentoring  plan.    The  goals  of  the  mentoring program are to promote growth and leverage human capital.  11.2.1.1.1.    Promote  Growth.    Create  an  environment  that  promotes  personal  and  professional growth  through  the  Continuum  of  Learning  and  enhancing  occupational  and  institutional competencies.  11.2.1.1.2.  Leverage Human Capital.  Provide a vehicle for leaders and subordinates to leverage strategic knowledge and intellectual capital throughout the Air Force.  11.2.1.2.  Career Planning.  MyVECTOR allows the user to view their duty experience through career field specific experience codes.  This structure also allows the user to build career plans based on real opportunities and to share these career plans with development teams and mentors.   11.2.1.3.  Knowledge Sharing.  MyVECTOR provides discussion forums and links to resources for online books and courses that discuss mentoring benefits, the differences between coaching and mentoring and techniques for managing mentoring relationships.  11.3.  Progression Planning.  Progression planning is the responsibility of the CFM and applies to all personnel in the career field.  For most AFSCs, the progression plan developed through the Specialty Training Requirements Team and the Utilization and Training Workshop is sufficient to technically develop Airmen in the ranks of Airman Basic through Master Sergeant.  The CFM utilizes input from the FAC and EDT to develop and adjust the career field progression plan as needed.   For Official Use Only  Page 54 of 97   11.4.    Succession  Planning.    Succession  planning  is  the  responsibility  of  EDTs  and  entails identifying  Key  Developmental  Positions  (KDPs)  and  Key  Leadership  Positions  (KLPs),  and ensuring a bench of qualified candidates is available to fill those positions.  Succession planning typically happens at the senior master sergeant and chief master sergeant ranks.  11.5.  Developmental Needs Analysis (DNA).  While individual records of performance may be compared  to  understand  and  trend  the  norms  within  the  specialty  (ex.  leadership  positions, mission  exposure,  education,  PME,  diversity  and  inclusion,  quality  force  indicators,  etc.),  the focus must be to derive the career opportunities that are in the best developmental interest of the individual  and  that  support  the  career  field’s  ability  to  fill  existing/projected  Air  Force requirements.    The  EDT  is  NOT  a  promotion  board.    Therefore,  records  are  not  scored  in  a fashion  that  may  be  perceived  as  a  collective  stratification,  endorsement,  or  a  promotion recommendation by the EDT.   11.6.    Vectoring.    The  vectoring  process  aims  at  purposefully  guiding  the  career  growth  of Airmen.    As  Airmen  develop  in  breadth  and  depth  of  technical  experience,  they  will  also progress through appropriate leadership positions and/or opportunities.  Assignment vectors are the EDT’s collective recommendation for an experience level or position type a member should be considered for during the upcoming EDT cycle (12 months following board execution).  The vectors  themselves  DO  NOT  constitute  an  actual  assignment,  but  are  added  fidelity  to requirements  provided  to  HQ  AFPC/DPAA3  (Space  Assignment  Team).    Assignments  are matched IAW AFI 36-2110 (Assignments).    11.7.    Broadening.    Space  systems  operations  professionals  should  pursue  opportunities  when available  and  appropriate  for  development,  both  within  the  specialty,  as  well  as  other institutional areas.  Professionals experienced in multiple space mission areas are better suited to serve  as  “operational  integrators”  and  “strategic  managers.”    Developmental  opportunities enhance leadership perspectives and prepare Airmen for “senior leader” roles.  11.8.  AF Developmental  Special Duty (DSD).   The  Air  Force has placed special  emphasis on certain special duties based on their broad impact on Airmen, families and the future of the Air Force.  DSD is a deliberate eligibility and selection process that allows commanders to nominate their best performers for special duties that create, develop and care for Airmen.  The nominative process is based on a minimum quota for each major command that is levied every six months.  12.  CMSgt Development.   12.1.  CMSgt Career Development Paths.  Space systems operations CMSgts are developed and utilized  in  functional  (Career  Field  Management  track)  and  institutional  (Command  CMSgt track)  duties  that  prepare  them  for  key  developmental  and  key  leadership  positions  within  the specialty  and  Air  Force  at-large.    Figure  12.1.  (CMSgt  Development  Paths  for  Space  Systems Operations) depicts the functional and institutional paths for the 1C600 CEM code.      For Official Use Only  Page 55 of 97  Figure 12.1. CMSgt Development Paths for Space Systems Operations.  12.2.  CMSgt Professional Development.  In addition to managing assignments and retirements, the  Chiefs’  Group  is  responsible  for  the  development  of  CMSgts.    Refer  to  the  Chiefs’  Group website for more information on the development courses.  This includes the following courses:  12.2.1.  Air Force Smart Operations (AFSO) 21 Senior Executive Leadership Course.  AFSO21 augments General Officer (GO), Senior Executive Service (SES), Career Field Manager (CFM), and Command Chief Master Sergeant (CCM) leadership skills with an understanding of how to manage  performance  and  strategically  align  continuous  process  improvement  using  AFSO21 tools.  This is a 2-day course, normally held at the University of Tennessee.  Attendance is based on nomination by the MAJCOM.    12.2.2.    Enterprise  Perspective  Seminar  (EPS).    EPS  gives  participants  executive  level  insights into  the  inner  workings  of  government.    Participants  will  examine  the  local  and  global implications  of  congressional  decisions;  Administration  policies  and  their  impact  on  DoD;  the Supreme Court and its role in policy; and issues in the economic, national security, and political arenas.    This  is  a  4-day  course,  normally  held  in  Washington,  D.C.    Attendance  is  based  on nomination by the MAJCOM.    12.2.3.  Gettysburg Leadership Experience (GLE).  GLE brings into sharper focus the dual role of  CMSgts  as  leaders  and  followers.  The  program  explores  the  changing  requirements  and challenges  of  the  CMSgt  role,  especially  considering  the  expanding  role  of  senior  enlisted leaders in today’s force.  12.2.4.    KEYSTONE.   KEYSTONE  is  the  enlisted  parallel  to  the  CAPSTONE  course  for  new General Officers tailored for the specific challenges of the Senior Enlisted Leaders (SEL).  The course is designed for Command Senior Enlisted Leaders (CSELs) currently serving in or slated to serve in a general or flag officer level joint headquarters or Service headquarters that could be assigned  as  a  joint  task  force.    Participants  visit  the  Combatant  Commands,  Joint  Task  Forces   For Official Use Only  Page 56 of 97  (JTF),  and  both  officer  and  enlisted  senior  leaders  in  the  Washington,  DC  area  to  explore  the relationships  and  challenges  of  operating  in  a  joint  environment.    The  course  covers  the  very special relationship between the Command Senior Enlisted Leader of a Joint Force Commander and the enlisted personnel from all the services operating under the Commander.  Attendance for Keystone is managed by the CMSAF’s office while the Chiefs Group solicits nominations from the MAJCOM CCC and COCOM SELs. CMSgts must have at least 2 years retainability.  12.2.5.  Leadership Enhancement/ Development Program (LEP/LDP) and Enterprise Leadership Seminar (ELS).  These two senior leader development courses are primarily targeted for CMSgts serving in the highest institutional and organizational CMSgt positions (to include CFMs, CCM and CCM candidates).  Because developmental opportunities are limited, CMSgts with at least 2 years  retainability  and  those  who  have  not  attended  a  developmental  opportunity  within  12 months are generally considered.  Once selected for a development course, the deferment request must be endorsed by the MAJCOM CV or equivalent.  Attendance is based on nomination by the MAJCOM.    12.2.5.1.  LEP/LDP is designed to enhance individual leadership capabilities and organizational impact  through  extensive  assessment,  group  discussions,  small  group  activities,  and  personal coaching.  12.2.5.2.  ELS provides a collaborative and powerfully engaging opportunity for participants to increase their effectiveness by gaining an understanding of business skills within the context of current Air Force issues and Washington AOR perspective.  Topics include Strategic Sourcing, Decision  Making,  Financial  and  Risk  Management,  Ethics,  Strategic  Human  Resource Management, Negotiation and Collaboration across Organizations, and Leading Change.  12.2.6.    Regional  Seminars.    The  Regional  Seminar  series  focuses  on  exploring  the  social, cultural, political, and economic developments of specific regions of the world.  This is a 3-day course,  normally  held  in  Washington,  D.C.    Attendance  is  based  on  nomination  by  the MAJCOM.    12.2.7.    Senior  Enlisted  Legal  Orientation  (SELO).    SELO  is  a  2-3  day  course  designed  to provide legal training to all first time Command Chiefs to ensure they are properly trained on the legal aspects of their position and to prepare them to advise their commanders on enlisted issues.  Training subjects include, courts-martial, Article 15, ethics, installation issues, fundraising, Non-Federal Entities, and a host of other topics.

Skill level training requirements in this specialty are defined in terms of tasks and knowledge requirements.  This section outlines the specialty qualification requirements for each skill level in broad, general terms and establishes the mandatory requirements for entry, award, and  retention  of  each  skill  level.    The  specific  task  and  knowledge  training  requirements  are identified in the STS at Part II, Section A and B of this CFETP.  In general, the 1C6 career field is made up of operational (crew jobs) and functional (staff jobs) requirements.    1.1.  Job Progression.  1.1.1.    Operational  Job  Progression.    This  section  applies  to  all  skill  levels.    When  personnel transfer  to  an  operational  squadron,  training  beyond  what  was  initially  received  at  the  ESO course  may  be  required.    This  training  may  be  waived  IAW  the  gaining  MAJCOM’s  policy(s) (for prior experience as an example).   1.1.2.    Staff  Job  Progression.    These  jobs  do  not  require  formal  AETC  training  but  do  require extensive experience within the career field.  Generally, it is beneficial for an individual to have been certified in one or more of the various operational jobs within the field before filling a staff position.  Tasks necessary to function in a staff position are trained and learned at the unit.    1.2.  General Skill Level Requirements.  1.2.1.  Personnel assigned to an operational unit are required to become mission-ready certified in the duty position commensurate with their grade.  If they fail to do so, the next skill level may not  be  awarded.    NOTE:    SMSgts  at  operational  units  are  not  required  to  be  mission-ready certified  to  be  awarded  the  9  skill  level.    However,  mission  requirements  may  necessitate positional certification.  1.2.2.    Personnel  assigned  to  staff  positions  (non-operational  duty  positions)  during  upgrade training must become duty position qualified in appropriate tasks for that position.  2.    Specialty  Qualification.    The  1C6  career  field  does  not  require  any  additional  special qualifications  other  than  those  described  in  Enlisted  Classification  Guide.    This  information  is located in the AFECD.  2.1.    Knowledge.    Knowledge  is  mandatory  of  the  following:  Satellite  C2  and  principles  of satellite  and  ground  systems;  space  warning  and  control  systems;  range  operations;  orbital mechanics; data analysis procedures; sensor theory; data transmission, receiving, recording, and relaying theory; and administrative practices.  2.2.    Education.    For  entry  into  this  specialty,  completion  of  high  school  algebra  is  required. Courses in physics, geometry, trigonometry, or computer science are highly desirable.  2.3.  Training.  For award of AFSC 1C631, completion of the ESO course is mandatory.     For Official Use Only  Page 60 of 97  2.4.  Experience.  The following experience is mandatory for award of the AFSC indicated:   2.4.1.  Apprentice (3) Skill Level.  Initial skills training in the enlisted space systems operations career field consists of task and knowledge training provided in the resident apprentice enlisted space  operations  course  listed  in  the  formal  schools  catalog.    Task  and  knowledge  training requirements are identified in the CFETP Part II STS.  In order to be awarded AFSC 1C631, an individual must complete the AFSC-awarding ESO course.         2.4.2.  Upgrade Training.  The 1C651 and 1C671 CDCs cover all major space operations mission areas  and  are  designed  to  take  students  beyond  what  was  learned  in  the  ESO  course  on  to  a greater understanding of space operations.   2.4.3.    Journeyman  (5)  Skill  Level.    Qualification  in  and  possession  of  AFSC  1C631.    To  be awarded AFSC 1C651, an individual must, if required by the duty position, pass an initial crew position evaluation, successfully complete the 5-skill level Career Development Courses (CDC), and  complete  the  required  time  in  the  skill  level  in  accordance  with  AFI  36-2201,  Classifying Military  Personnel.    Also,  experience  in  functions  such  as  C2  systems,  missile  warning,  space surveillance,  space  control,  telemetry  processing,  ground  systems  configuration,  mission planning, anomaly resolution, or range operations.  Active duty individuals will use the CDCs to prepare  for  promotion  testing  under  the  Weighted  Airman  Promotions  System  (WAPS).  Additionally, members at this point in their career should be working towards completing their Community College of the Air Force (CCAF) degree.   2.4.4.    Craftsman  (7)  Skill  Level.    Qualification  in  and  possession  of  AFSC  1C651.    To  be awarded  AFSC  1C671,  an  individual  must  be  a  SSgt,  and  if  required  by  the  duty  position, complete all CMR training as identified in the appropriate space operations system IPOI, pass an initial  crew  position  evaluation,  successfully  complete  the  7-skill  level  Career  Development Courses (CDC), and complete requirements in accordance with AFI 36-2201.  Also, experience performing or supervising space systems operations functions and activities.  2.4.5.  Superintendent (9) Skill Level.  Qualification in and possession of AFSC 1C671.  Also, experience  managing  space  systems  operations  activities.    To  be  awarded  AFSC  1C691,  an individual must be a SMSgt.   2.5.    Other.    The  following  are  mandatory  as  indicated  (reference  Air  Force  Enlisted Classification Directory):  2.5.1.    For  entry,  award,  and  retention  of  AFSCs  1C611/31/51/71,  physical  qualification  for space operations duty according to the Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory.   2.5.2.

Award of the 3-skill level without a completed SSBI is authorized provided an interim Top Secret clearance has been granted according to AFI 31-501.    For Official Use Only  Page 61 of 97  Section D - Resource Contraints  1.    Purpose.    This  section  identifies  known  resource  constraints  that  preclude  optimal  and desired  training  from  being  developed  or  conducted,  including  information  such  as  cost  and manpower.    Narrative  explanations  of  each  resource  constraint  and  an  impact  statement describing what effect each constraint has on training are included.  Also included in this section are  actions  required,  OPR,  and  target  completion  dates.    Resource  constraints  will  be,  as  a minimum, reviewed and updated annually.  2.    Apprentice  3-Level  Training:    No  constraints.    Changes  to  weapon  systems,  upgrades and/or  modifications,  and  requests  for  additional/new  training  may  drive  additional  resources; however,  these  will  be  addressed  through  the  Course  Resource  Estimate  (CRE)  process  once identified by the STRT, U&TW, TPT, or other formal meetings with appropriate coordination.  3.  Journeyman 5-Level Training:  No constraints.  4.  Craftsman 7-Level Training:  No constraints.  5.  Superintendent 9-Level Training:  Not applicable.  Section E - Transitional Training Guide    There are currently no transitional training requirements.  This area is reserved.    For Official Use Only  Page 62 of 97  PART II  Section A – Specialty Training Standard (STS)  1.    Implementation.    This  STS  will  be  used  for  technical  training  provided  by  AETC.  Implementation date varies for each weapon system initial skills training course.  2.  Purpose.  As prescribed, this STS:  2.1.  Lists in the column 1 (Task, Knowledge, and Technical Reference) the most common tasks, knowledge, and Technical References (TR) necessary for Airmen to perform duties in the 3-, 5-, and 7-skill level.  Column 2 (Core Tasks) would identify, by asterisk (*), specialty-wide training requirements;  however,  there  are  no  core  tasks  identified  for  this  specialty.    Due  to  the  wide variety  of  weapon  systems  and  associated  qualification  requirements  within  the  specialty,  the career field does not have any core tasks due to the wide variance of tasks and duties within the AFSC.  2.2.    Provides  certification  for  OJT.    Column  3  is  used  to  record  completion  of  tasks  and knowledge  training  requirements.    Use  automated  training  management  systems  to  document technician qualifications, if available.  Task certification must show a certification or completed date.   2.2.1.  Unlike other career fields, the 1C6 AFSC does not train and certify by individual tasks to attain  skill  level  award.    Certification  involves  the  performance  of  many  tasks  simultaneously.  Operational  crew  duty  position  certification  is  based  on  grade  and  meeting  qualification requirements, not skill level.  2.2.2.  Training example:  Individual training tasks, such as fire procedures, is not a standalone task.  Other stimuli (tasks) such as equipment overheating procedures will drive the performance requirement  for fire procedures.  Many such tasks are performed and  evaluated  simultaneously along with other crew positions.  2.2.3.    Grade  example:    A  retrainee  NCO  (3-level)  will  be  trained  and  certified  for  the  Crew Chief position as this position is designated for NCOs and above.  The individual’s 3-skill level will not affect this process, and there is no requirement to wait until the individual is awarded the 5-skill level to begin upgrading and certifying the individual to the Crew Chief position.  2.3.    Shows  formal  training  and  correspondence  course  requirements.    Column  4  shows  the proficiency to be demonstrated on the job by the graduate as a result of training on the task and knowledge and the career knowledge provided by the correspondence course.   2.4.  Contains Qualitative Requirements.  Contains the proficiency code key used to indicate the level of training and knowledge provided by resident training and CDCs.  2.5.  Is used to document task when placed in AF Form 623, On-The-Job Training Record, and according to AFI 36-2201, Chapter 6.     For Official Use Only  Page 63 of 97   2.6.  For the Active Duty component; is a guide for development of promotion tests used in the Weighted  Airman  Promotion  System  (WAPS).  Specialty  Knowledge  Tests  (SKTs)  are developed  at  the  AETC  Airman  Advancement  Division,  by  Senior  NCOs  with  extensive practical  experience  in  their  career  fields.    The  tests  sample  knowledge  of  STS  subject  matter areas  judged  by  test  development  team  members  as  most  appropriate  for  promotion  to  higher grades.    Questions  are  based  upon  study  references  listed  in  the  WAPS  catalog.  Individual responsibilities are in Chapter 1 of AFI 36-2605, AF Military Personnel Testing System. WAPS is not applicable to ARC personnel.  3.  Recommendations.

Measurement.    Each  objective  is  indicated  as  follows:  W  indicates  task  or  subject knowledge,  which  is  measured  using  a  written  test.    PC  indicates  required  task  performance, which is measured with  a  performance progress  check.   P indicates  required task performance, which  is  measured  with  a  performance  test.    PC/W  indicates  separate  measurement  of  both knowledge and performance elements using a written test and a performance progress check.  2.    Standard.    The  standard  is  75%  on  written  examinations.    Standards  for  performance measurement  are indicated in the objective  and  delineated on the individual progress  checklist.  Instructors  use  the  checklist  to  document  each  student’s  progress  on  each  task.    Instructor assistance may be provided during the progress check, and students may be required to repeat all or  part  of  the  behavior  until  satisfactory  performance  is  attained.    Students  must  satisfactorily complete all PCs prior to taking the written test.  3.    Proficiency  Level.    Most  task  performance  is  taught  to  the  “2b”  proficiency  level,  which means the student can do most parts of the task but does need assistance on the hardest parts of the task (partially proficient).  The student can also determine step-by-step procedures for doing the  task.    IST  mixes  classroom  instruction  with  hands-on  operation  through  the  use  of  a trainer/simulator/emulator.    A  fully  proficient,  MR  crewmember  is  attained  through  the  unit’s specific MQT.    4.    Course  Objectives.

The purpose of the Enlisted Space Systems Operations (1C6X1) Air Force Job Qualification Standard  (AFJQS)  is  to  identify  minimum  and  advanced  training  required  for  the  1C6X1 specialty.  The AFJQS will remain in effect until superseded or rescinded.  2.    Document  training  required  by  the  AFJQS  in  accordance  with  AFI  36-2201,  Air  Force Training Program.  The AFJQS will be filed in the AF Form 623, Individual Training Record, or electronic equivalent.  Use pencil when documenting paper based JQS.  2.1.    Individuals  are  trained  in  each  task  to  the  proficiency  code  key  (PCK)  level  indicated.  Trainers are qualified on the task to be trained and are in the grade of SrA and above.  2.2.    Upon  assignment,  the  supervisor  identifies  duty  position  requirements  of  the  member  by circling the paragraph number or letter of each task statement.  As the member begins training on each  task,  enter  a  start  date  (day,  month,  and  year).    Upon  completion  of  training,  enter  a completion date (day, month, year), and the trainee and trainers initials.  2.3.    If  the  trainee  is  assigned  an  additional  duty  or  task  not  in  the  JQS,  the  supervisor  will develop  an  AF  797  Job  Qualification  Standard  Continuation/Command  JQS.   The supervisor/trainer will then develop a plan for the member to receive training and become duty position qualified.  2.4.  Transcribing documentation to a new JQS is an administrative function, not a reevaluation of training.  Upon publication of a new JQS, use the following procedures to transcribe:  2.4.1.    For  tasks  previously  certified  and  required  in  the  current  duty  position,  circle  the subparagraph number next to the task statement and enter in the current date in the completion column.  Trainee initials in the trainee column and the current task certifier or supervisor/trainer initials in the trainer column.  2.4.2.  For tasks previously certified but not required in the current duty position, transcribe only the previous certification date.  Tasks are not circled or initialed.  2.4.3.  Annotate on AF Form 623a or approved electronic database (ex. AFTR, PEX, TBA, etc.) that the record was transcribed (i.e., “I certify the information contained in the JQS dated X was transcribed to the JQS dated XX, and then trainee was given the superseded JQS;” Signed, dated, supervisor and trainee).  3.

(PRINCIPLES) Can analyze facts and  principles and draw conclusions about the subject. (ANALYSIS) Can evaluate conditions and make proper decisions about the subject.  (EVALUATION) EXPLANATIONS Note:  All tasks and knowledge items shown with a proficiency code are trained during wartime.. *  A task knowledge value may be used alone or with a task performance scale value to define a level of a specific      task.  (Examples:  b and 1b) **  A subject knowledge scale value is used alone to define a level of knowledge for a subject not directly related to       any specific task or for a subject common in several tasks. /  This mark is used to show a difference between the career field training level desire and AETC’s limited training resources.  (Example:  2b/B.  The career field desire is 2b, but only a B level can be achieved due to resource limitations.)     No proficiency codes indicate no training is provided in the course or CDC.
