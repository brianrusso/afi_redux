This guide provides guidance for home station and deployed Air Force Services Prime RIBSpersonnel and base augmentees performing mortuary affairs search and recovery (S&R) operations. Itidentifies and provides home station and Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) contingency planning proce-dures for conducting search and recovery of deceased United States (US) military personnel, US noncom-batants, allied, coalition partner, third country, and adversary personnel. The guide addressesrequirements and approaches to S&R that should be considered by Services. It also addresses some of thecircumstances where a Services mortuary S&R team may have to either perform expedient S&R or pro-vide a non-Services unit with support for some type of expedient S&R. This publication is not directive innature. Records required by directive publications will be maintained according to applicable Air Forcerecord management programs and disposition schedules. Primary Sources. This handbook was developed from Air Force Services’ publications, Tyndall (SilverFlag) Services Combat Training and Air Force Institute of Technology mortuary affairs search and recov-ery course materials, contacts with their instructors, and contacts with AFSVA mortuary affairs personnel.Additional sources for this publication were after action report inputs provided by locations supportingoverseas deployments. The following publications and electronic guides were used for writing this publi-cation: the Silver Flag Exercise Site’s Prime RIBS Contingency Training Handbook; the Headquarters AirForce Services Agency (HQ AFSVA) Readiness web page (https://www-r.afsv.af.mil)]; AFI 10-214,Prime RIBS Program; AFI 34-242, Mortuary Affairs Program; drafts of the updated Joint Publication4-06, Joint Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Mortuary Affairs in Joint Operations; DoD Directive1300.33, Mortuary Affairs Policy; and safety publications AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports,and AFPAM 91-211, USAF Guide to Aviation Safety Investigation. In addition, valuable lessons learnedwere identified for the September 11th Pentagon recovery, as released in RAND PublicationCF-176-OSTP and the companion Columbia University Fathom seminar, Protecting EmergencyResponders: Lessons Learned from Terrorist Attacks. Mission of S&R. When there is an incident (such as a transportation mishap involving military vehicles),a fatal aircraft mishap, or mass casualties (normally five or more military deaths that could be associatedwith a mishap, terrorist attack, or a natural disaster) that involve Air Force/Department of Defense (DoD)personnel, all reasonable steps must be taken to recover and identify the individuals. Under the NationalResponse Plan (NRP), DoD may be tasked to provide assistance at a mass-fatality incident that does notinvolve military personnel. Military support is provided through specific tasking by the United StatesNorthern Command (USNORTHCOM). As determined by US policy or DoD requirements, military mor-tuary affairs support may also be provided for foreign humanitarian or mass-fatality efforts, whether ornot the US has a military presence in the country or area of responsibility. DoD policy is that every reasonable effort should be made to identify remains and account for unrecov-ered remains of US military personnel, employees, contractors, their dependents and others who die inmilitary operations, training mishaps, and other multiple fatality incidents. The mission of Services S&Ris to recover all the remains and do so in a manner that preserves dignity, respect, and evidence. The goalof the mortuary affairs program for outside the continental United States (OCONUS) contingency opera-6AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006tions is to complete the mortuary S&R mission, ensure that all remains are returned to CONUS as quicklyas possible, and preserve the remains for identification. With terrorist and guerrilla tactics focusingattacks on buildings and vehicles, Services’ ability to support S&R responses for fire and blast-damagedbuildings and vehicles takes on more significance. Services units must plan for and maintain a capabilityto conduct a greater variety of S&R operations, including while deployed and operating under increasedthreat. Due to the possibility of increased threat, OCONUS AEF contingency teams may have to adopt somemethods and techniques to expedite the typical S&R process (see Section 6). For mishaps in high threatareas, expedient S&R by a Services team or a unit or special team conducting remains recovery may haveto suffice. In these cases, security information on the location would be required for a follow-on S&R forany further remains. S&R personnel must develop plans for conducting S&R operations and maintain all required equipmentand protective gear. By following procedures, S&R teams provide for more thorough recovery of remainsand capturing of data, which may be crucial in identifying personnel and contributing to the process foridentifying the causes of mishaps. S&R may have to operate in locations that are very difficult to work inbecause of location and terrain. Figure 1.  S&R Operations May Have to Overcome Many Obstacles. Whether in CONUS, Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), U.S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), or even in someOCONUS AEF contingency locations, military S&R is not required for every mortuary case. Often whencivilian S&R occurred, the identification of an individual was determined by a civil jurisdiction throughthe hospital or coroner or medical examiner. The military must still determine how the identification wasestablished and obtain the appropriate documentation from the civil authority. The military must be con-vinced that the recovered human remains were recovered as completely as possible given the situation atthe location (i.e., loss-site, whether a mishap, attack, disaster, aviation mishap, etc.). The medical examiner will determine if follow-on military or civilian S&R is justified. If there are diffi-culties in making a decision or working with civilian authorities, the main source for obtaining support isthrough the Office of the Armed Forces Medical Examiner. The other appropriate contacts are with yourmajor command (MAJCOM) Services mortuary personnel and the Air Force Mortuary Affairs office(AFSVA/SVOM). Office of the Armed Forces Medical Examiner. The Office of the Armed Forces Medical Examiner(OAFME) is a tri-service military organization with personnel from the Departments of the Army, Navy,and Air Force, as well as American Registry of Pathology civilian employees. They provide on-scene sup-port for most fatal aircraft mishaps. Whether during peacetime or hostilities (whenever possible), a com-AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 20067plete autopsy must be performed on all aircrew involved in an aircraft mishap. OAFME’s medicalexaminers provide autopsy determinations of cause and manner of death, as well as interpretive opinionsthat relate observed injuries to the actual (aircraft) crash sequence. Services’ S&R efforts to recover allremains and personal equipment are an important contribution to the gathering of evidence. Besides beingof value for identifying fragmented remains, experts can obtain significant data from careful examinationof the casualty’s personal equipment. Scratches on hard items and tears of clothing may be correlated withinjuries found during the autopsy. Even the direction of blood flow from lacerations may help determinethe position the dead service member at the time of injury. Especially during contingencies, this may helpin determining if the mishap was the result of a mishap or hostile fire. Transitions in Capabilities.  This is primarily a concern for deploying forces that will be a part of anAEF or joint service contingency operation. Support for S&R basically builds with the flow of Unit TypeCodes (UTCs) within the overall force module flow for a deployment. Preliminary mortuary capabilitiesshould arrive during the initial 24 hours of a deployment with the LWRRA team and the LWRRG kit (seeFigure 2.). Figure 2.  Force Module Mortuary Transitions. Mortuary capabilities increase during the establish-the-base and operate-the-base phases. S&R capabili-ties are primarily built when sustainment operations begin, but Services personnel should train and becapable of providing at least an initial cadre capability for S&R during the establish-the-base phase ofbeddown. Section 6 of this handbook addresses the primary S&R requirement capabilities for deploy-ments and contingencies. Roles and Definitions. Most response team preparations have historically been based on responding to amishap involving military personnel, usually involving a DoD aircraft mishap. However, deaths causedby other various fatal occurrences (i.e., ground transportation mishaps, fires, enemy or terrorist attacks,mass casualty events, building collapses, or natural disasters) could require S&R. Response to these events should be handled with procedures similar to those involving aircraft mishaps.Especially when OCONUS for deployments, you must develop base and unit operating instructions (OIs)that define the roles of the major responding members. Be aware that wing plans for disaster responses8AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006will also cover many aspects of your responses where S&R operations will be employed. The wing plansand your OIs must be compatible. S&R pre-planning should address: (1) having a workable team rosterwith recall procedures; (2) an updated list of supporting agencies (including AFSVA/SVOM); (3) stan-dard sets of reporting procedures and locations; (4) a full set of checklists for confirming availability (orobtaining when it is not possible to have on hand) of the equipment, supplies, communications, and trans-portation requirements; (5) standard safety and security procedures; and (6) identifying the types of facil-ities for holding, tentatively identifying, and examining remains. Figure 3.  Terrorist Attacks on Vehicles and Buildings Add to Services’ S&R Efforts. The primary military representatives who may be involved with Services during the S&R timeframe arelisted in Table 1. Some parallel or responsible civil authority positions are also listed. Some of these posi-tions may not be relevant for every mishap or loss location, but do apply to most situations. AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 20069Table 1.

Team members must be trained andequipped to perform S&R line searches and marking, trainedin recognizing the need for and use of PPE, be trained for basichuman remains recognition, be able to recover fragmentedremains under supervision, and must have taken CISM PEPtraining.   1. Some members may be trained to create mishap    sketches-diagrams.   2. Some members may receive familiarization training in use     of cameras and handheld GPS units.    3. In some regions team members may be chosen for    familiarity and certification in specialties that may     be required for their locale (i.e., mountain or rock climbing,    SCUBA diving). AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 200613Role Interim safety board Medical Officers Related Responsibilities 4. Several members should be trained and assigned to create    and fill in the log of events for pre-response, response, and    in-field efforts.  They should have computer and software    skills to create and fill in data sheets needed to log in all    recovered remains, personal effects, and any specially    labeled equipment.  This board is convened by the individual wing or group commander to provide a response to a major mishap (normally other than Category A).  The interim safety board (ISB) members preserve evidence before the arrival of the formally appointed safety investigation board. Based on mishap investigation procedures, two medical officers and a bioenvironmental specialist are normally involved with a loss of life mishap where S&R is required: (1) the ISB Medical Officer, (2) the mishap safety investigation board (SIB) Medical Officer, and (3) the base Bioenvironmental Engineer.  Interim safety board (ISB) medical officer.  An initialresponder from the nearest medical treatment facility.  Theflight surgeon normally becomes the ISB medical member forthe mishap.  This medical officer’s main function ispreservation of medical evidence.  The ISB Medical Officermay recover remains and life-science items prior to the arrivalof the S&R team at the site.  If off-base, this may requireapproval of the off-base authority with jurisdiction (seeCoroner or Medical Examiner). 1. This member is also on the scene to render medical    attention to survivors and to provide ongoing     medical support to the investigation, including S&R.   2. When off-base medical authorities respond and have     jurisdiction, the ISB Medical Officer should work     with those medical authorities and the local coroner     or medical examiner per pre-established agreements.   3. For mishaps, the ISB Medical Officer contacts the OAFME    to coordinate any forensic pathology assistance.   4. For off-base mishaps where the local jurisdiction     efforts may be inadequate, the OAFME becomes a     medical member with secondary jurisdictional authority.     (See Safety Investigation Board (SIB) item 3 regarding     jurisdiction.) 14Role Civil Engineers AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006Related Responsibilities Mishap safety investigation board (SIB) medical officer.   1. Assists in the identification process and requests additional     support as necessary for positive identification. 2. Obtains medical related evidence and records, collects and     safeguards other records, and provides for photographic     evidence to support identification. Bioenvironmental engineer.  (The bioenvironmentalengineer operates per AFPAM 91-211).   1. Determines what respiratory protection is required at     the site and advises the medical member of site hazards.   2. Determines what hazards are present on site and obtains    assistance from civil engineer (CE) environmental and     readiness technicians to help mitigate the situation.   3. Ensures that personnel providing on-site support have     proper PPE for biological, chemical, and composite     hazards. 4. Establishes work/rest cycles based on weather conditions. There are typically five CE Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs) that respond to and support an Air Force or other designated loss of life event which requires S&R.  They are listed below.  When the S&R and investigation teams have to remain on site, such as due to remote location, other CE AFSCs may be present to provide life-sustaining support with Services. Engineer Assistant.  Engineer assistants (EAs) providesurveying support for development of a detailed mishap sitemap.   1. Trained in use of higher precision electronic survey     equipment (including GPS). 2. They use a variety of surveying equipment and techniques     to plot information on plan drawings, and may      create information within an electronic geographic     information system (GIS) for detailed plotting for      safety and mishap investigation boards.  AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 200615Role Related Responsibilities 3. They must know Services S&R requirements to capture     data and provide detailed S&R plan drawing plots. Fire Department.  Firefighters are typically first responders and may remain on site as long as there is a danger of reigniting or exposure to hazardous substances.   1. During the initial response, whether it is an AF fire chief     or the local civilian counterpart, they usually have control     of the scene for the initial emergency response, rescue and    lifesaving, and fire fighting efforts.   2. They are typically more aware of the hazards associated     with aircraft components, fuels, propellants, oxidizers,     composite materials etc., as well as with other chemical     hazards.   3. They are an excellent first choice for bioenvironmental     engineers to contact to ascertain the types of hazards to      be considered for S&R.  Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Specialist.  EODmembers respond primarily to aircraft mishaps, but mayrespond to any mishaps or terrorist attacks where there areexplosives involved.   1. They identify, safe, remove, or destroy explosive ordnance     that may be found in and around a mishap site if they are     unsure that it was consumed during the mishap.   2. They may have to remain on site when there is a risk of     exposure to unexploded ordnance.  3. Request a briefing from the EOD representative regarding    possible hazards and recognition requirements.  Environmental Specialist.  These members are more familiarwith the release of hazardous materials into the environmentsurrounding an mishap scene.   1. They may work with bioenvironmental engineers to    determine hazards, mitigation efforts, and protection.   2. They will normally take efforts to contain any hazardous     runoff or releases from spreading to other areas outside      of the crash site.  As such, they may find scattered remains     that have been carried off-site by flowing water.  16Role Safetyrepresentatives MishapInvestigations AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006Related Responsibilities Readiness Technician.

They may be on scene to help organize overall response     efforts and may coordinate for other CE support.   2. They often work with EOD, the bioenvironmental engineer,     firefighters, and environmental specialists to determine     precautions to take on site while working in the hazardous     environment. Primarily for aircraft mishaps, the tasked or responsible wing sends a trained flight safety officer, who may become the ISB Investigation Officer (IO).  1. The flight safety officer is at the mishap scene to ensure    there is preservation of physical evidence.   2. For other mishaps, a safety officer from ground safety may    be involved.   3. Safety officers should be directing photographers to     preserve the scene and to take photos and videos of any     efforts that may take place and could or will disturb the     scene. Air Force mishaps are identified in AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports, and the many categories are listed in Paragraph 1.6 Mishap Categories (see Appendix B-1).  Mortuary Officers supporting S&R should be aware of the categories, as the category could affect how you respond.  Be aware that there may be two boards.   The primary board is the safety investigation board (SIB).   The other board is for legal investigations –– an accident investigation board (AIB) for aerospace mishaps and a ground accident investigation board (GAIB) for ground mishaps not involving aerospace assets.  The accident investigation board may be conducted concurrent or in parallel with the safety investigation board.   Safety and legal investigations are not the same.  Services S&R may have to provide support to both boards.   AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 200617Role Related Responsibilities Safety Investigation Board (SIB).  The SIB is for mishap prevention and only the factual portion of the SIB report is releasable.  (The SIB operates per AFI 91-204.) 1. The SIB is the formal mishap investigation board appointed     by a MAJCOM commander.   2. The SIB is composed of the SIB President, an Air Force     Safety Center representative, an investigating officer, a     pilot member, a maintenance member, a medical member, a     commander’s representative, and a recorder. 3. Armed Forces Medical Examiner Teams are medical    members and may have primary or secondary jurisdiction     under federal law.   4. Experts in their field are added on as functional teams when    required.   5. Field investigation may be from a week to ten days.   6. Lower echelon commanders may convene an SIB when    broader expertise and objectivity are required to investigate     a less serious mishap.   7. A formal report is released but controlled.   Accident Investigation Board (AIB) and Ground Accident Investigation Board (GAIB).  AIBs and GAIBs are legal investigations to develop and report the cause or causes of the mishap and those factors that substantially contributed to the mishap.  AIB and GAIB reports are releasable in their entirety.  (The AIB operates per AFI 51-503 and the GAIB operates per AFI 91-507.) 1. The AIB or GAIB team is appointed and begins its     investigation as soon as it can do so without interfering with     the SIB team.   2. AIB and GAIB Presidents are usually field grade officers     (or civilian equivalent for GAIB), senior in grade to persons     involved in the mishap and come from outside the mishap     wing (for AIBs) or the squadron or group (for GAIBs),     unless waived.        a. For Class A aerospace mishaps involving a fatality, the         AIB President is a General Officer or Brigadier General         (select).   18Role Security Forces Other military-related personnel AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006Related Responsibilities      b. For aircraft mishaps, AIB Presidents are pilots or         navigators with experience in the aircraft involved.        c. For missile or space mishaps, AIB Presidents are a         missile or space operations officer with expertise and         experience in the system involved.      d. GAIB Presidents are individuals with sufficient          knowledge, skill, or training regarding the accident          subject area. 3. Team Composition.  Required AIB and GAIB members     include a President, a Legal Advisor, a Recorder (for     AIBs), plus others as required.  4. Legal investigations may follow up on the SIB investigation     and may be in the field longer than an SIB field team.   5. The AIB and GAIB investigation processes include     procedures for notifying the next of kin of persons killed      or seriously injured in the mishap and releasing the     investigation to the public.   Security Forces (SF) respond to secure the area and prevent intrusions.   1. Since many mishaps occur off base where SF have little or     no jurisdiction, they should have pre-coordinated security     arrangements with civil law enforcement personnel,     including:      a. Establishing liaison with local police authorities to         ensure prompt reporting of off-base mishaps.      b. Adequate traffic control en route to the mishap scene.      c. Security at the scene.      d. Help in communicating with people at remote mishap         locations, such as use of police radio nets to speed up         initial communications.   2. They may have to work with local or state wildlife officials     to obtain support for or to allow use of weapons to keep     varmints from removing remains at a mishap site.   Judge Advocate (JAG).   Memorandums of agreement and understanding (MoAs and MoUs) should be run past the JAG for review prior to being maintained by wing plans (XP).  AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 200619Role Related Responsibilities 1. A JAG representative at a mishap or off-base emergency     response (that involves S&R) may be more aware of all     existing MoAs and MoUs or know which office can assist     in locating any of these types of agreements.   2. The JAG is available for legal advice concerning various     legal questions, which may arise during S&R.  Advice may     include issues of jurisdiction over the remains to proper     handling of potential claimants.  Contingency Contracting Officer (CCO).   1. The CCO is an important element of the response, as they     can use contingency or emergency procedures to obtain     resources when base resources are exceeded.   2. They can help with obtaining contract support of water,     food, utilities, equipment, vehicles, and supplies that the     response, S&R, support, and mishap investigation teams     will require. 3. For bases that have converted (such as under A-76) to     contract support, many key emergency response positions     (i.e., CE operations and fire, Services, security) could be     affected.  The CCO may be able to authorize unforeseen     contract changes to provide proper support. Public Affairs (PA).  PA representatives maintain liaison with civilian media and manage media inputs for contingency operations.  1. They must be knowledgeable of mishap and other     contingency plans and respond to mishaps and incidents.   2. They may be of value in keeping media personnel informed     and help to avoid media intrusion in S&R efforts.  20Role MAJCOM or Component Forward/Rear  HQ Services representatives AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006Related Responsibilities Special Agents.  Office of Special Investigations (OSI) and other military special agents (as well as agents from various federal departments) could be in charge of the loss location when a criminal or terrorist act has caused the deaths.  Their procedures take precedence and S&R must be coordinated with them as a part of evidence gathering and preservation.  They may have control of the site, but work with OAFME, as the local medical examiner or OAFME retain control of the remains (See following section on Federal, state, or local investigation teams.) Airfield Management.  Airfield managers work with civil engineer (environmental planners, natural resource officers, and operations and maintenance technicians) and local and state authorities to determine the best methods to mitigate airfield hazards and bird/wildlife aircraft strike hazards (BASH).  While S&R efforts are underway, they may be better trained and equipped for supporting efforts to deter wildlife from scavenging the mishap scene based on their airfield BASH equipment, techniques, and professional contacts.  Alert Photographer.  Alert photographers are directed by the ISB Medical Officer and Investigating Officer; they assist S&R team efforts by documenting location and position of remains and personal effects.  Support includes still photos and video. Determine the lines of communications and the chain of command for reporting.  These will vary by type of incident, location, branches of service, and major commands involved.   1. Always start with your MAJCOM or theater Services     representative.   2. Determine the collateral commands and services to notify as     the authorities for actions (i.e., deployed unit, home station,     deploying command).  3. Determine the circumstances where you may be contacting     AFSVA/SVOM directly or through your higher chain of     command. AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 200621Role Civilian authorities  Local, state, or country authorities may have jurisdiction for Related Responsibilities all or various aspects of: emergency or mishap response, search and rescue, and search and recovery.  Work with the JAG and your military counterparts to these agencies when dealing with the following. Coroner or medical examiner (usually referred to herein as the ME).  The ME may own the mishap or mishap scene and are responsible for release or turnover of remains to the mortuary.   1. The ME may work with military medical authority as     coordinated under a MoA, MoU, or per agreement     coordinated by the OAFME.   2. Depending on the circumstances and location, the ME may     direct recovery operations within a hazardous situation. 3. The ME identifies the deceased. Federal, state, or local investigation teams may be involved with initial evidence gathering at an off-base mishap until it is determined that the military has jurisdiction or can share investigation responsibility.  They will also be involved with any mass fatality-casualty efforts tasked under the NRP.  Department of Homeland Security (DHS) directorates and agencies will have jurisdiction for various aspects of the response and investigation.  Military mortuary affairs support is a part of NRP support.    1. Work with Security Forces and OSI for any security related     issues.   2. A military safety coordinator may be appointed-provided by     the AF Safety Center to coordinate efforts with civilian     authorities for aircraft mishaps.   3. For suspected terrorist events and mass fatality incidents,     DHS agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation     (FBI), Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and     Explosives (ATF), and other federal investigatory agencies     may take over and direct actions in spite of normal state,     local, or military jurisdictional authority.  The OSI or     resident installation special agent and the OAFME are the     military’s points of contact for working on-scene Services     S&R efforts with federal involvement.   22Role AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006Related Responsibilities Local fire department crash rescue/recovery personnel and search and rescue (SAR).  They are usually the first responders responsible for firefighting, life saving, and SAR.   1. They may have to transition their efforts to assist Services in     S&R at hazardous locations.   2. In case of building fires or collapse of structures, local    departments may have to conduct criminal and arson    investigations and SAR concurrent with Air Force initial    responses.   3. They may remain on scene to support Services’ initial S&R. Law enforcement.  State and local law enforcement usually has jurisdiction for off-base responses.  Work with Security Forces and OSI for any security related issues.   Federal Aviation Agency or National Transportation Safety Board.  While not typically involved with a military mishap, they may be involved if the mishap also involved a collision with a civilian aircraft or the aircraft is a military charter.    NOTE: For bases that use A-76 contracts for operations and maintenance support, always closely review the statement of work for the contractor's specific capabilities, taskings, and support requirements as they directly relate to mishaps.  Develop and include mishap response plans in A-76 studies and contract documents to ensure that support will be adequate to support Services during on- and off-base mishap responses.  Contracting officers must be intimately knowledgeable of contract requirements and support capabilities during mishap responses.Civilian community initial response members (i.e., those that provide SAR , S&R, law enforcement, envi-ronmental, fire department, and coroner or medical examiner support) are usually involved in all off-basemishaps. For the most part, Security Forces, Medical Group, and Civil Engineer (CE) environmental andfire department personnel have knowledge of the cooperative agreements with their civilian counterpartsand can be of assistance. However, the jurisdictional medical examiner (ME) can own the scene of off-base mishaps and controlthe remains. What you do must be cleared with them; they may even assume some or most of the imme-diate responsibility for the remains. Coordinate with the OAFME to work issues of control of remains andS&R efforts. Ensure that you notify the ME that for deceased military, the ME’s office should not take action for thecare of the remains, as the Services Mortuary Officer will act as the agent for the person authorized toAFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 200623direct disposition of the remains. The ISB Medical Officer would normally provide them with similarguidance regarding control and disposition of clothing and other personal effects and life support relateditems, if remains had to be moved or removed from the site. NOTE: When local identification is adequate, the person authorized to direct disposition of the remains may use the mortuary of their choice as coordinated by Services.  If identification cannot immediately be made locally by the ME, OAFME, or OAFME working with the ME, then the remains or DNA samples may have to be shipped to Dover for further identification efforts.  If this presents difficulties, then OAFME can work within the ME’s facilities, but this can present legal and funds management issues regarding paying for unfunded expenses. For aircraft crash sites, unless the mishap is quite remote, members of the media are likely to be presentwhen S&R is conducted in CONUS, PACAF, or USAFE. It is a frequent occurrence that mishap responseteams have been hampered by news media helicopters hovering overhead or media vehicles blockingroads at the mishap. S&R responders may face some of the same difficulties with media representativesbeing present when S&R teams perform their duties. When off-base, unless an area has been declared aNational Defense Area (NDA), local law enforcement, MEs, and other emergency responders have theauthority and responsibility to protect the area from damaging intrusions, as well as to protect on-scenecrews from danger or injury. Work with them to provide as much isolation from the media as necessary todo your work. Figure 4.  S&R May be Quite Difficult Even without the Media Creating Additional Hazards. You will probably be working in a hazardous environment such as chemical or fuel spills, biomedical haz-ards of human remains (i.e., bloodborne pathogens), burned areas, loose debris, composite materials,other sharp objects, and dangerous terrain. It is important that media helicopters keep their distance. Lawenforcement personnel can usually advise media copter pilots of the conditions and warn them what/howto avoid or not to create any rotor downwash that would kick up toxic materials, rekindle fires, or createflying debris. If this does not work, then law enforcement, emergency management, or fire personnel cancontact the Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) Flight Standards District Office to keep media aircraft awayfrom or at higher altitudes near the mishap, even if the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) isnot investigating the mishap (i.e., solely a military aircraft). Memorandums of Agreement or Understanding. There may be several memorandums of agreement(MoAs) or understanding (MoUs) that apply to an off-base mishap. Depending on whether the aircraft ismilitary or a Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) aircraft, the investigation may be military, FAA, NTSB, or24AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006even an international effort. Memorandums may involve law enforcement, transportation authority, firedepartment, state-local search and rescue units, medical response and treatment, and ME agencies. Juris-diction varies depending on geographical areas, so determine with the JAG or the agency’s military coun-terpart if there is a MoA or MoU with the responding civilian authority. The Mortuary Officer and theMedical Group each have responsibility to ensure that there are MoUs (or an overall agreement orresponse plan) to provide support for and transitions between medical treatment, medical examiner sup-port, and mortuary responsibility. The Mortuary Officer should coordinate or develop MoUs with theMedical Group and obtain a copy of all MoAs and MoUs with local MEs. The local responding medicalofficer is normally the main point of contact for issues that may arise during the interim mishap board por-tion of a mishap response. When there is a death of a service member, jurisdiction must be determined. There are three kinds of juris-diction: exclusive federal jurisdiction (there is no civilian (local) authority), concurrent jurisdiction (eithercivilian (local) or military authorities can have jurisdiction), and proprietary jurisdiction (usually entirelycivilian (local)). For concurrent jurisdiction, a local ME with jurisdiction may waive jurisdiction to allowmilitary efforts. Deaths in areas of exclusive federal jurisdiction belong to the OAFME. Military bases arenot necessarily under exclusive federal jurisdiction. In all cases the local JAG should be consulted regard-ing authority. The individual with jurisdiction has authority to order and perform an autopsy on humanremains. Figure 5.  MoUs Are Very Important for Fatal Military Mishaps-Mishaps Off Base. Regardless of the jurisdiction, the OAFME must be notified (normally by the medical officer or OSI(when criminal or terrorist actions are suspected)). The OAFME will perform autopsies on all military air-craft mishaps for which it can obtain jurisdiction. Agreements on S&R, control of the mishap site, andpreservation and identification of the remains are of prime importance at military mishaps and terroristattacks. The OAFME must be contacted to make arrangements. AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 200625Agreements and procedures affecting S&R are not always clear-cut and geographic circumstances caninfluence agreements. S&R efforts may be dictated by where a mishap occurs. Many airlift supportrequirements are met using Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) aircraft (i.e., civil air carriers committed toprovide support by contract) and the location of the mishap may dictate the responsible parties and theprocedures used. The following S&R case study on the December 1985 Gander Newfoundland crashpoints out the importance of developing mutual agreements and having standard procedures to rely onbefore an emergency response. Table 2.  Case Study of a Complicated S&R Involving a Contract Military Transport Mishap. Action Mishap background Remarks During the early dawn of 12 December 1985, the Army’s 101st Airborne Division lost 248 personnel.   The aircraft was a DC-8 military contract charter flight(i.e., Arrow Air flight with a crew of eight). The  personnel  were  returning  from  a  six-monthdeployment to the Sinai as a part of a multinational force.They carried medical and dental records The aircraft crashed on takeoff at the end of the runway inGander, Newfoundland, after refueling. All on board were killed by the impact or the resulting fires(that burned for more than four hours).  Canadian teams provided most S&R and mishap investigation, with minimal U.S. military and federal assistance allowed. There was no initial memorandum of agreement to allowUS military or federal support. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) conductedrecovery operations at the crash site, mapping out the crashsite into an area 350 meters long by 50 meters wide.  Thearea was further broken down into 10-by-10 and 10-by-30meter grids. Initial S&R efforts 26Action Timeline of S&R Mortuary expert inputs Bargaining for an MoU AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006Remarks The first day after the crash was for S&R, where 125 bodies were discovered and 100 dead were removed to a temporary morgue set up in a hanger at Gander International Airport.   Three days after the crash, a US-Canadian MoU wassigned to allow military S&R tagging of remains andsending the remains and effects to Dover AFB. Four days after the crash, the RCMP announced that allremains were believed to have been removed from thecrash site.  A six-inch snowfall covered the crash sitebefore a final sweep could be made. Canadian and US Office of Armed Forces Medical Examiner (OAFME) pathologists at the Dover mortuary center jointly agreed that an adequate inventory of remains had been retrieved.  . Seven days after the crash, the decision was made topreserve the site. AFIP personnel visited the crash site to examine andphotograph the wreckage and document ground gouges,tree strikes and burn patterns. Eleven days after the crash, all autopsies of the collectedremains had been completed.  There were at least twobodies that had not been recovered. Seventeen days after the crash, planning began immediately to reopen S&R operations. Negotiations held on how to approach S&R and whatprocedures would be used for the crash site. AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 200627Action Second S&R Remarks Twenty-eight days after the crash, a second S&R effort was carried out primarily by five four-man teams composed of Army graves registration specialists.   An additional four-man team was added two weeks later toprovide for relief and rotation of the S&R teams. Approximately 10-meter square shelters were constructedfor use on the site to allow propane jet heaters to melt thesnow. Army graves registration teams divided the enclosed areasinto one-meter-wide lanes, with one specialist workingeach lane.  The specialists conducted the search on handsand knees with brick mason trowels and garden tools to siftthrough the soil and ash.   Because almost all medical and dental records were onboard the aircraft, recovery efforts included trying torecover these items as well as remains and personal effects. The second S&R lasted 26 days and was completed 54days after the crash.  Recovery consisted of the following. 1. Two complete remains. 2. Over 300 anatomical portions. 3. Approximately 100 health records.  4. Four  and  one-half  tons  of  personal  effects  and  unitequipment. 5. A  hanger  full  of  aircraft  parts  uncovered  during  thesecond recovery mission. 28Action Final identification results AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006Remarks All 256 souls on board were identified. 1. 226 were identified from fingerprint and dental com-parisons. 2. 22  were  identified  by  combinations  of  association  ofpersonal effects, anthropologic, medical, radiographicand  dental  comparisons,  and  facial  reconstructiondrawings. 3. 8 bodies, which lacked any type of identification, wereidentified by a comprehensive effort that reviewed orcreated data from oral pathology, anthropology gravesregistration (personal effects), mortuary affairs, pathol-ogy, radiology photography, facial reconstruction, andan FBI disaster squad fingerprint effort, using an auto-mated data processing and medical records/repository(library) system to sort and process the materials andinformation. While Air Force Services has standard S&R procedures and teams, each mishap or mishap is different.S&R procedures, equipment, and techniques must be tailored to the mishap, circumstances, weather, andthe jurisdictional authority’s requirements. Media Precautions. Since S&R teams can still be either in the media spotlight of a camera lens or amicrophone, teams must use precautions when conducting on-scene operations and communications.When possible, plan to use encrypted radios to avoid interception of sensitive information. While mega-phones may be useful and okay to use in some locations, and may be required for safety’s sake, teamchiefs and team leaders should usually consider using walkie-talkie type systems with hands-free micro-phones most of the time. They usually provide for better, quieter communications. Take precautions whenusing cell phones and carefully control your equipment if you must take photos during contingency oremergency situations. Take advantage of any existing or brought-in screening materials (vehicles, trees,tents) that can be used when setting up mortuary support equipment on scene. Be aware of where media are located and advise law enforcement of any immediately occurring sensitiveprocedures when recovering remains (i.e., picking up large body parts or intact remains). Law enforce-ment can help divert media intrusions, especially where the media may want to approach personnelremoving and carrying remains. In addition to normal pre-S&R team briefing on procedures and the stresses of the situation, it is advisableto let team members know the extent of press coverage at the site. This can help team members be moretempered in their actions, which could be misinterpreted or blown out of proportion by the media. Ensure that the on-scene Public Affairs representative is knowledgeable about your procedures, so mediapersonnel can be briefed regarding the basic processes being used and the stresses that can be placed onthe teams. Most media personnel will not be familiar with military S&R requirements and procedures. AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 200629Figure 6.  September 11th Pentagon Search and Rescue Followed by Search and Recovery Stress Emergency Responders. 30AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006S&R Notification Process. For most fatal incidents, proper notification normally starts with a wing com-mand post (CP) emergency operations controller (or similar function when deployed) following emer-gency action plans (EAPs) or operating instructions (OIs). The controller calls the Services Commanderin the capacities of Mortuary Affairs Officer (MO) and Search and Recovery (S&R) team chief. Whiledeployed, the contact may be through the Services Control Center. The CP continues EAP contacts tonotify the other primary response support participants, including civil engineers and logistics readiness,which Services will have to directly rely upon for initial S&R efforts. The CP would also notify the mis-sion support group commander, who coordinates and directs many overall support requirements for crisisactions, responses, and resource priorities. Initial notification procedures should identify the situation of the incident, the basic location, the numberof souls-on-board for aircraft mishaps or larger transportation mishaps or attacks (such as those involvinga transport ship, charter aircraft, train, bus, or van), and that mortuary and S&R support may be required.If confirmed loss of life is known, then this should also be passed on to the Mortuary Officer. Upon noti-fication, the S&R team chief needs to determine that there is an actual requirement for mortuary affairssupport and S&R efforts. Not every loss of life incident requires S&R. The Mortuary Officer shoulddetermine whether or not deceased service members have been or will be recovered by a civil authoritywith jurisdiction. If circumstances dictate that S&R is required, then the next step is to determine which type of response touse. There may be several detailed wing response plans to address loss of life based on mishap categoriesand the situation, such as related to a single seat or multi-seat military aircraft mishap, mass casualty froman mishap or hostile act, single or mass casualty deaths caused by natural disaster (such as a flash flood,tornado, etc.), or a terrorist attack. Whatever the type of loss, there are two initial actions required by theS&R team chief. The first action is to initiate a notification and alerting of both mortuary support personnel and S&R teammembers. A recall could be initiated for S&R team members (if required) based on known information. Ifdeployed, the Services Control Center can be fully activated. As a minimum, S&R OICs, NCOICs, andteam leaders should be notified to begin initial actions to (1) pull together the mandatory S&R suppliesand equipment and (2) identify any shortfalls in core and other S&R team personnel. The second action is to follow EAP response procedures to gain early access to the mishap scene to deter-mine the details of the loss situation. This is needed to refine requirements for the number of S&R teampersonnel, logistics support, personal protective equipment, vehicles, meals, water supplies, on-site mor-tuary holding-cold storage, etc. There are two additional actions that run concurrent with the first two efforts: begin a log of events(Appendix A) and the hazard assessment review process (Appendix B). Preparatory Notifications. With the initial team actions underway and with your present knowledge ofthe fatality situation (i.e., there is more than one fatality or there is dismemberment (even with a singlefatality)), the installation’s MO should request mortician assistance with the S&R efforts. This requestAFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 200631should be through the MO’s MAJCOM Services mortuary personnel notifying AFSVA/SVOM. This willalso allow the MO to press ahead with other initial efforts. It will also allow AFSVA/SVOM to initiateactions to provide assistance as requested. When more specifics are known on the fatality situation (i.e.,there are multiple fatalities from a single incident (usually three or more fatalities from the same base) andwhen all families are present at the installation), then the MO should request AFSVA/SVOM to provideassistance for working with and briefing the families. This will also help the MO to press ahead withmany other urgent taskings. Site-Specific Considerations.  While usually not a first responder, the Services commander or divisionchief should try to arrive on site as early as possible to conduct a site investigation. Services’ initialresponse is normally as the MO going on-site with the follow-on response element. When on site, the MOdetermines if S&R is appropriate. As the S&R team chief, the MO must consider many aspects of supportand hazard assessment (see Appendix B). After actually seeing the loss site and determining the conditionand number of remains that will be recovered, the S&R team chief needs to consider numerous responserequirements and support required for the various agencies (i.e., security forces, fire department, environ-mental and engineering technicians, etc.). When determining support-response requirements, especiallyfor those involving aircraft impacts, there are at least eight major areas to consider: time, terrain, tem-perature, trajectory, threats, transportation, teams, and training. Time. When can you get to the site and how much time do you have to work the first day and then eachfollowing day? What will be the travel time? What about the time that each team can be available on site(based on stress factors, meals, cleanup, etc.)? What is the expected total time for primary S&R? Whatabout total time on site to support investigation teams and be present during wreckage move-ment-removal? Terrain. The type of recovery is primarily based on the terrain and trajectory of impact as they affect scat-ter of wreckage and remains. The terrain also affects the S&R teams’ ability to approach the location,maneuver at the location, identify objects and remains, and then remove the remains. 32AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006Table 3.  Terrain-Based S&R Considerations. Terrain Type Open field Primary S&R Considerations 1. Typical S&R site sweep search patterns and recovery can be used. Brush land Desert 2. The extent of human remains scatter can usually be esti-mated easily based on scatter of aircraft wreckage (unless an ejection seat was used) 3. Except for impact craters, remains may be more accessi-ble for recovery. 4. The site can be more easily secured to protect against scavengers.  1. Depending on the height of brush and whether or not it burned, standard search patterns may have to be altered.  Rope or barrier tape-marked boundary lanes and grids may have to be used for S&R searches. 2. The extent of scatter is harder to determine for both human remains and wreckage.  Cadaver dogs can help identify the limits of search areas.  Determine if these animals are available in your area and what type of efforts they can support. 3. The site may pose hidden hazards from animals and rep-tiles.   4. Scavenging by varmints can be a major concern. 5. Some remains may be embedded within brush piles and bushes.  These may be hard to reach and may not be readily recognizable except by smell. 6. Mapping the location for remains is more difficult, but good results are possible using proper GPS survey meth-ods, lane marking, and alternate methods for marking and sighting. 1. Generally the same concerns as for brush land except for barren deserts with primarily sand and rock. 2. Barren deserts usually have the same concerns as open fields and may be searched using standard sweep pat-terns. 3. Temperature extremes may greatly shorten the ability to perform some S&R tasks when higher levels of PPE are required (i.e., full coveralls, Tyvek® suits, etc.) AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 200633Terrain Type Water (lake-river-ocean shore) Primary S&R Considerations 1. Water S&R normally requires immediate efforts to obtain support from special civilian S&R teams, Navy or Coast Guard dive teams with S&R training, or specially trained AF personnel who can provide support. 2. The type and depth of water are a major consideration due to submerged debris, unknown scatter of remains, and possible movement of remains and debris due to tides or water flow.  3. Typical S&R sweep search patterns and recovery may not be possible except in shallow water.   4. May require underwater cameras to allow videotaping of the scene and various aspects of the recovery process in lieu of other search techniques. 5. For rivers (or creeks, irrigation canals, etc.), rapid move-ment of remains downstream can be a major concern that requires action to have personnel pick up floating remains.  6. Requires boats and special purpose teams and equip-ment.   7. Scavenging can be a severe problem (by creatures great and small), especially in some salt-water locations. 8. Hazardous liquids can make the location a multi-hazard environment where special PPE is always required. 9. Mapping the location for remains can be quite difficult and only rough order GPS methods may be possible. 34Terrain Type Swamp AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006Primary S&R Considerations Other than operating under hostile fire, this is often the most hazardous place to conduct S&R operations and can cause more CISM concerns than many other recoveries of the same size.  1. Generally all the same concerns as would be expected by combining brush land and water body recoveries, except that the water may not be flowing. 2. Typical S&R search patterns and recovery may not be possible except in shallow water. 3. Depth of the water and hazardous reptiles can be major problems. 4. Fatigue- and temperature-related stresses are major lim-iting factors.  Heat stress is normally a critical factor. 5. Searching techniques that require feeling for remains (even with poles and tongs-grasps) in obscured waters can be an extreme CISM concern. 6. Hot weather swamps can pose extreme biomedical haz-ards due to exposure to decomposing remains and blood-borne pathogens, as well other environmental hazards. 7. Cadaver dogs maybe required to find scattered remains near the surface of the water. Exposure to floating or continuously released hazardous fuels or chemicals can create life-threatening situations when not immediately detected.  AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 200635Terrain Type Mountain-steep slopes Forest and tropical forest-jungle Primary S&R Considerations Mountainside recovery concerns vary by the degree of slope, the location on the slope, the rock and earth geology, and the wreckage and remains scatter.  (See Appendix B) 1. Typical S&R search patterns and recovery techniques may not be possible.  Lane and grid searches using teth-ered members may be required.  Special teams and assis-tance may be required immediately. 2. Talus is the accumulation of rock debris on a slope or at the base of a mountain or cliff.  Fractured-rock talus slopes can be made up of rock sizes that range from small boulders to gravel.  These loose talus slopes can be extremely dangerous due to unstable conditions that can cause gradual or sudden collapse.  The collapse can bury or injure S&R team members and further cover up remains and wreckage.  3. On lower slopes, up-slope overhangs can collapse on S&R team members. 4. Scavenging can be a problem. 5. Mapping the location for remains can be quite difficult and GPS and standard surveying methods may not be as useful or possible. The types of forest vary greatly.  All forests can create problems with sighting and recovering of remains caught within trees or dense tree canopies. 1. Generally the same concerns as for brush lands, except that dense forests and jungles create even greater visibil-ity problems and hazards for S&R teams. 2. Forests can pose major problems for obtaining GPS readings.  Lane and confined-area grid searches and manual marking for mapping may be required. 3. Scavenging can be a major concern. 4. Decomposition is a major concern.  5. Heat stress is a major concern in jungles and tropical for-ests. 36Terrain Type Buildings (including multistory buildings) AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006Primary S&R Considerations 1. Condition of the facility is a major concern and possibili-ties of collapse must be considered.   2. Ceiling and floor collapse risks must be ascertained prior to entry of each part of the building. 3. S&R may have to be done along with an accompanying shoring team and firefighters. 4. Specially trained urban search and rescue team structural technicians may have to accompany the Services S&R team. 5. Normal search methods are not practical for most build-ings.  Room-by-room confined area searches are normal.  Cadaver dogs may be required to find remains buried in debris. 6. Marking of remains and identifying personal items can be a problem, especially in very confined quarters.  Con-current marking, photo, and recovery-removal may be used to mark and bag remains. 7. Breathing apparatus and respirators may be required, especially when there has been a fire involved. 8. Hazardous materials such as asbestos or other insulation products must be considered along with possible com-bustion hazards.  As a minimum, all participants should be in coveralls. 9. Plotting of remains and personal effects within rooms and halls (corridors) is usually done by using tape mea-sures and estimating positions on floor plans or grid drawings for each room and hall. 10. S&R tagging nomenclature is changed to reflect the names or designations on the floor plans.  AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 200637Terrain Type Snow-covered areas Primary S&R Considerations 1. Requires special clothing for protection from overheat-ing, freezing, and wet snow and moisture buildup.   2. Normally requires special equipment and vehicles to access the site.  3. Access location normally has to be near but not at the site if helicopters are used, due to chances that down-wash will obliterate signs of remains and wreckage. 4. Special equipment for use on site such as snowshoes, ski poles, longer stakes, longer flags, shovels, large area tents, and large heaters to melt snow. 5. Cadaver dogs normally required to find buried remains in deeper snows. Temperature. The temperatures and humidity may have a drastic affect on how long remains are recogniz-able or identifiable. It also affects the type of equipment team members need and the number of teammembers required based on heat stress or cold stress. Trajectory (at impact). For aircraft mishaps, except for a mid-air breakup, the trajectory at impact is nor-mally a very deciding point on the type and scatter of remains. Vertical impacts tend to be very compactand may crater in soft soils. Shallow impacts are linear, but can cause a compact or very wide scatter ofwreckage and remains. Trajectory, speed, and terrain each play a part in scatter. The wider the scatter andthe more terrain covered with debris and remains, the larger the total team requirements and the amountof resources required for S&R. Figure 7.  Examples of Trajectory Impacts. 38AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006Threats. Whether CONUS or OCONUS, contingency responses must consider any possible threats toS&R team members at mishaps or other losses. These range from: fire hazards; biomedical bloodbornepathogen hazards; hazardous materials, chemicals, fuels, and objects; hostile threats from an enemy; pos-sible poisonous or deadly flora or fauna (i.e., mammals, insects, amphibians, reptiles, marine life (fish,mammals, invertebrates, etc.); conventional chemical contaminated remains; and chemical, biological,radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) contaminated remains. Assessing the threats will dictate if or whenyou can conduct normal S&R, the size and type of teams, the type of S&R recovery operations, the PPEthat will be required, and any other associated support personnel and equipment required. Threats can dic-tate the requirements for replacing or cleaning of PPE and clothing. Fire department, security forces, envi-ronmental specialists, and medical personnel all have a critical role in identifying threats and their impactson S&R. Transportation. What is needed to get the S&R teams to the site, sustain their mission, and support themas they shuttle back and forth to the site? Will travel back and forth from homestation be feasible or willlodging be required in the area? For some remote areas, contingency lodging may be required and contin-gency equipment sets moved forward. Consider maintaining serviceable home station training (HST)equipment (tents, feeding equipment, etc.) in a trailer, or have a pre-identified source where a trailer ortruck can be rented. Teams. Given the recovery area size, terrain, condition of the remains, number of remains, temperatureand PPE-related heat/cold stress factors, will the standard 13-/26-person teams be adequate? Will addi-tional military personnel have to be tasked, cleared, and trained as augmentees? Are military S&R teamsrequired from other bases? Will civilian teams be required to augment portions of the support or even con-duct some of the efforts? For mass casualty mishaps or incidents involving weapons of mass destruction,federal teams may have to be accessed. Training. Besides situational and critical incident stress management (CISM) briefings, what just-in-time(JIT) training may be required to meet the S&R situation and use of PPE? In addition to the above, it is a necessity to determine if there were other humans or animals killed at thelocation. Mishaps such as an aircraft crashing into an occupied residence, across a roadway, or in an openfield with cattle will all create other remains that may make it hard or impossible for S&R team membersto clearly distinguish the various military remains. It may also require that civil authorities maintain fullcontrol of S&R. Let the Services mortuary chain of command know if other losses are involved or sus-pected. OAFME may have to provide earlier support to help determine the type of remains during eveninitial S&R. Once you have identified the above site-specific considerations, then you move on to refiningthe basic plans for logistics support. Determining Basic Logistical Requirements. Services officers wear a dual hat for many mishaps andmishaps; they normally have to consider contingency site support for personnel at the scene (contingencymeals, water, lodging, etc.) as well as plan for mortuary S&R. The primary emphasis of this handbook isfor the S&R-specific efforts and does not address contingency site support in detail. Contingency sitesupport should be addressed in standard response plans. There is a minimum basis for having S&R supplies to be used in a field deployable S&R kit. Some S&Rsupplies are required by practice (i.e., they are mandatory for the operation). Other supplies are requiredbased on analysis of the situation and circumstances (i.e., personal protective equipment (PPE), terrain,temperature, condition of the remains, etc.). Table 4. lists mandatory and basic requirements for S&R.Bold text items are basic requirements or categories of support (depending on your geographic location).AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 200639Some items are listed based on field experience and common use. They are not necessarily addressed ineven the latest addition of AFI 34-242, Mortuary Affairs Program. Where experience has shown thatother items can be or have been used or substituted, and when additional items may be necessary, theseare presented in italics. Table 4.  Basic S&R Logistics (Supplies, Equipment, and Support) Requirements. Item Minimum Quantity S&R recovery items  Human Remains Pouch (HRP)  More than one HRP per soul-on-board will probably berequired for all mishaps and mishaps.  Being able to rapidlyobtain additional HRPs from Logistics Readiness supply is amust. Plastic Bags 18 inches x 12 inches  1. This is a standard GSA-type supply item. 2. The Military Specification requirement is for heavy duty,waterproof, greaseproof, transparent bags made frompolyethylene.   If additional bags are required, consider using top-closing,polyethylene-based: heavy duty freezer bags, hospital bio-medical  waste  or  specimen  bags,  and  commercial  gradefood storage and industrial parts service bags as suitablesubstitutes.  These come in a large assortment of sizes thatmay better meet the needs on site.   3.4. Bags are readily available locally or on a rush order frommany manufacturers and regional distributors. 5. Heat-sealable  bags  with  a  vacuum-sealing  machine  canprovide better protection from biohazards.   Grease pencil, china marker Standard opaque, permanent markers or laundry markers haveproved to be reliable for marking stakes, bags, tags, flagging,and flags.  Have these on hand in the same quantity as above,but also keep a few grease pencils and china markers.  Tag, shipping, cloth with wire tie  These are standard shipping tags (NSN 8135-00-178-9193). 8 each 1,000 each 24 each 5,000 each AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006Minimum Quantity 1,000 each 40Item Stakes, at least 4 feet long, locally manufactured (by contract or CE if necessary).  Large numbers of these stakes may not be readily available or useful at many mishap-mishap scenes.  Alternative products should be considered.  Examples can be found at http://www.quikstake.com/surveyor/surveyor.html or more commonly as shown.  See Section 4 Marking Stakes, Flags, and Tapes. 1. For confined areas, areas with many individual fragmented    remains, and remains in open fields without obstructions,    small marker flags can be used for much of the marking.       a. High visibility flags in various colors are readily         available from surveyor supply distributors.       b. Various colors         can be selected          for use at          mishap scenes to         more easily allow         mishap and safety         investigation teams         to see the layout of         tagged and          removed items and         remains (i.e.,         remains, personal         effects, critical aircraft parts, impact points).       c. Flags may be obtained with wire flagsticks of 15-, 21-,         and 30-inch lengths in various flag sizes, which can          aid in marking in high grass and brush. 2. Wire-type flags can be wrapped around objects to help with     siting marked remains and personal effects tagged locations    in dense brush or forest areas. 3. High visibility survey      flagging (matching the flags)      of 1-, 1 1/4-, and 2-inch widths     can be used to help with easier     siting of tagged remains and     personal effects in brush or     forest areas.  Permanent    markers can write upon them     for additional reference control. AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 200641Item Minimum Quantity 4. For areas with very hard soil, U-, T-, L-, and C-shaped    lightweight steel fence posts can be used in place of tall    wooden stakes to allow better driving into the soil.   5. Manual post drivers    can be used with    metal fence posts    and wood stakes to    aid in driving    markers.  They can    be purchased, made    by CE, or made     under a contract. Bed sheets, white (or a subdued color in a contingency environment) (flat, twin or double, same as used for normal bedding) Leather gloves (work type, cowhide, sizes small through large)  These are standard GSA-type supply items.  Local purchases may be necessary for on-site replacement of lost, damaged, or contaminated items or to meet sizing needs. Gloves, heavy duty (orthopedic) surgical gloves  Masks, surgical type 12 each 26 pairs 5 packages 5 packages 42AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006Item Minimum Quantity Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).  S&R teams must plan ahead for stocking or immediately obtaining PPE.  This is especially important when mishaps involve aircraft or combat losses involving other weapon systems (such as some Army special purpose vehicles) that include composite materials.  MAJCOMs and air components will procure and stock enough PPE to outfit a 10-person core team.   The recommended amounts/types are listed in AFI 34-242, Table 6.2 represent minimal PPE requirements to outfit one person for five days.  Refer to the Services Agency Readiness website and TO 00-105E-9, Emergency Rescue and Mishap Response Information, Chapter 3.  Additional sets should be obtained based on determinations made at the site investigation or where OCONUS bases may have to pre-position PPE due to possible supply line delays. The Bioenvironmental Engineer makes the final determination as to what type PPE (including respirators) are required based on the specific health risk assessment at the mishap site.  Also contact the Bioenvironmental Engineer for guidance when responding to an expedient S&R at a combat loss where a specific health assessment cannot be accomplished before entry.

Barrier tape to mark lanes being worked.  [Tape used rather than ropes as      any ropes used should only be for life-safety purposes.] AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 200647Item Minimum Quantity Cratered Impacts 1. Fire department’s exhaust fan or a large diameter (4 to 5 feet) circulation    fan used for fresh air or to remove fumes. Can be obtained from    building supply and fire-safety supply stores.  Generator support may    also be required. 2. Cool air may have to be ducted (with flexible ducts) to specific areas being    searched.  Flightline (equipment) air conditioners with ducts may     be required. 3. Rope ladders or extension ladders may be used to work on steeper slopes. Buildings 1. Hardhats and goggles to wear in areas that have been damaged by fire     or collapse.  2. Standard cotton coveralls in areas exposed to fire, unless Tyvek® coveralls    required for special hazards (asbestos, chemicals). 3. Colored adhesive duct or plastic lane tape, 2-inch    wide, to stick on walls and floor surfaces. Allows    marking on floors and walls to indicate remains and     personal effects tag numbers.

Large exhaust fans to remove    smoke or other pollutants and    provide fresh air.  Usually    initially used by fire    department, but large    diameter (4 to 5 feet) exhaust    or circulation fans can be    obtained from building supply    and fire-safety supply stores if    needed for longer term use.  Air may have to be ducted (with flexible ducts)    to specific areas being searched.  48Item AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006Minimum Quantity 6. Respirators and breathing masks for work in areas exposed to dust    (including concrete dust), smoke damage, asbestos, building insulation    materials, etc.  Temperature variations 1. Coveralls, general purpose (for warm weather) and insulated     (for cold weather).  Standard commercial cotton and cotton-polyester    coveralls used as S&R clothing in lieu of military uniforms when:     a. Site conditions are likely to damage or ruin uniforms and/or      b. Temperature conditions require either cooler or warmer outer clothing.  2. Extreme cold conditions warrant insulated steel    toe boots, arctic weather clothing (gloves,    coveralls or overalls and jackets), and extreme    cold breathing masks and/or oral filters.       a. Extreme cold weather items should be         stocked in locations that may support         extreme cold S&R.     b. Extreme cold items are available from         DSCP’s Warfighter Net at         http://ct.dscp.dla.mil using Search         term “extreme cold”. 3. Extreme heat may require using hot weather steel toed boots and broad    brimmed hats.  Items are available from DSCP’s Warfighter Net at     http://ct.dscp.dla.mil using Search term “hot weather”. 4. Snow conditions can increase not only cold but also create wet and     icy conditions.  Deep snows require snowshoes, ski poles, warming tents,     and large area tents and heaters to melt snow in a remains field search area     to allow finding and removal of remains.   Fragmented or Contaminated Remains Equipment (Always work with thebioenvironmental engineers when developing biomedical hazardous material(HAZMAT) related Services kit items.  Bioenvironmental engineers willdetermine PPE and disposal procedures for HAZMAT efforts.) 1. Barrels-drums, tarps, wheelbarrows, plywood, shovels, rakes.  Used to pick    up, catch, and move sifted materials at the location.  Common local     purchase items if not already available on base. AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 200649Item Minimum Quantity 2. Hazardous waste barrels.  May have to be used to contain sifted waste that     is environmentally contaminated material.  CE would provide and     remove waste and store in barrels after S&R sifting. 3. Hazardous waste containers.  Should be used to contain and transport     coveralls and other PPE apparel contaminated at the site.  Contents would     be taken to a laundry facility for cleaning or to a disposal site as required.  4. Hazardous Biomedical tags or bags.  Although fragmented remains are in     and of themselves hazardous substances for S&R members, remains that     have been exposed to hazardous chemicals or CBRN contamination     may require separate tagging or bagging to identify that there is     added concern.  See Section 4.  Some remains may require being placed     in heat-sealed vacuum bags in lieu of top closing bags. 5. Hand tools.  Garden tools and medical forceps can be used for removal     of embedded human remain fragments from craters and sifting boxes.  50Item AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006Minimum Quantity 6. Debris sifting boxes.     Constructed of wood frame    with expanded metal, woven    metal mesh, or welded mesh     sieve material in the bottom.    Wire mesh should be     suitable to the area soils    and conditions.  Mesh size    should be about 3/8 by 3/8    inch mesh for most soils.     Sandy or silty soils may    allow use of 1/4 by 1/4 inch    mesh, while gravel or clay soils may require 1/2 by 1/2 inch mesh.  Use the    larger diameter (smaller gauge number) wire sizes that are available in the    mesh size you need.  This will help avoid breakage during field use.  Sifting    boxes are available through local manufacture by contract or CE.  There    are typically two types.       a. Freestanding box using folding or rigid legs.  Can be larger, but may be       cumbersome to transport and assemble.  Leg attachment points may       require maintenance during use.      b. Box with extension handles.  Smaller boxes can rest on wheelbarrows         and drums.  Larger boxes can be used with folding saw horses and        provide more portability. AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 200651Item Minimum Quantity Other Common Equipment and Tools 1. Visual support.  Working in brush, deserts, and swamp-wetlands may     require having visual contact or oversight.  Lightweight 8-, 10-, and 12-foot    step-ladders can be very helpful during many situations where maintaining    visual contact is important.  They are also needed to use when driving in    longer siting poles and grid poles used for alignment and searches, as well     as searching the top portion of bushes and some trees. 2. Maneuvering while in a search line.  Swamps, sand, snow, brush, and rocky    hillsides can all cause members to fall due to unseen conditions or loose     soils.       a. Straight ski poles (various sizes about armpit height) with plastic         baskets bottom web for swamps, sand, and snow.     b. Adjustable length walking or hiking staffs (trekking poles) with carbide         tips (with or without small rock baskets) for hard soils with loose rocks         or rocky slopes.   3. Handling sharp objects.     Moving small debris    during the recovery    process may require more     than just protective gloves.     Several sizes of small    wrecking bars can help    pull or wedge debris away    from remains.4. Protection from sharp objects.  When actually    working up close or around composites or sharp    metals, additional protection may be required for    the lower legs. Baseball catcher shin guards are a    good choice, especially since they can go over a    Tyvek® coverall or standard chemical suits. 5. Removal of remains from debris or ashes.  Numerous    kinds of shovels prove useful and have different    purposes.  Long handle round point and short handle   utility shovels are good to dig the area around   remains for removal.  Short handle flat nose shovels   are good to lift loose remains scattered in debris and   ashes for placing in sifting boxes.  52Item AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006Minimum Quantity 6. Reach tools.  Various    types of (snake)    grabber tongs are    good for reaching into    bushes or other areas    where remains may    have lodged and    having a safe reach is    required.  Garden    rakes and cultivators also provide good reach and can be used to help move    small debris or wreckage away from remains. NOTE: The term "Tyvek® coverall" is used throughout Table 4. and this handbook.  There are various levels of protection afforded by Tyvek®, military Tyvek® F, and other manufacturers' Tyvek-type clothing.  These coveralls range from simple, inexpensive disposable coveralls (for protection against dust and some liquids - no CBRN protection) to semi impervious coveralls to fully encapsulated, impervious coated suits (for protection against fuels and almost all biological and chemical dust and liquid hazards).  Shelf life may range from 2-5, 10, or 15 years depending on storage, interim or intermittent use, and type of coverall.  Likewise, prices range from less than $10 for some coveralls to approximately $200 for a suit.  Coverall protection must be carefully chosen as a part of the overall personal protective equipment package.Choosing Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).  Common and more unique PPE items were identifiedin Table 4. or the cited references. It is important to identify the proper PPE prior to deploying to themishap location. Once S&R personnel are on site, there is little time to obtain PPE that adequately fitsthe team members. Also, one of the aspects of PPE is to ensure that personnel are trained in its wear anduse. Based on the earliest known information of the mishap, the Mortuary Officer-S&R team chief shouldconduct a hazard assessment review (see Appendix B) and discuss the on-scene hazards with the bioenvi-ronmental engineer, wing safety, and fire response personnel. The Bioenvironmental Engineer will iden-tify specific PPE requirements. PPE that are not already included as S&R emergency response kit itemsshould be obtained for team members as an emergency procurement if the item is not available otherwise.PPE are divided into three areas for protection: respiration, ocular, and dermal. Responses to aircraft orother mishaps that involve composite materials require special cautions when choosing respirators, eyeprotection, and skin protection (see Appendix C). While PPE physically protect the wearers, it can also help in the mental well-being of S&R team mem-bers. Even with excellent programs for handling critical incident stress, problems with post traumaticstress flashbacks and hyperarousal symptoms (i.e., panic attacks, severe headaches, nausea, and insom-nia) do occur as a result of more traumatic S&R efforts. Just putting on an everyday uniform item (such asa BDU or DCU, hats, and boots) that was also worn at a mishap scene S&R effort can trigger sensory andmemory flashbacks for affected members. This is especially so when: (1) the personal wear items becomeassociated with strong smells or stains at a mishap scene, (2) members have handled recognizableremains, or (3) members may have unintentionally stepped on or touched remains. AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 200653NOTE: For contingency locations, it may not be possible to use alternative outer protective equipment other than the standard chemical contamination protection suits and several pairs of leather and surgical gloves.  However, respirator choices will be determined by bioenvironmental engineers with consideration that the chemical protective masks may not be suitable for use at a mishap unless special filters are ordered based on more specific chemical-environment hazards. For rougher, longer S&R operations, PPE kits should include common team clothing items such asnumerous sets of dust or protective coveralls, pairs of gloves, a pair of protective boots, and a hat. Ahardhat may also be required if additional protection is necessary. These items should be available foreach team member who will be closely handling remains or conducting search efforts for remains, partic-ularly for S&R operations that are conducted under more traumatic circumstances. Figure 8.  There Are Many Choices and Levels of Appropriate PPE. The chances are great that S&R contamination will require replacement of clothing items. Also, a com-mon critical incident response practice, which is used to reassure victims of traumatic mishaps, is to pro-vide comfort, medical care, food, and replacement clothing. When possible, plan to have extra coveralls,safety boots and gloves, and hats readily available, as they may be needed by more than just core teammembers. Requiring S&R team members to have to justify and obtain new personal clothing items dam-aged during S&R can be regressive to critical incident stress practices. NOTE: Teams that have been in the field for a week (or more) at remote recovery operations have had problems with S&R team members being unable to maintain or clean normal BDUs/DCUs used during S&R.  Providing, washing, and replacing standard coveralls is usually a good hygienic practice and easier on team members.   Important parts of PPE are respirators, masks, and filter masks. For specific concerns on use of filtermasks, respirators, or self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), check with your BioenvironmentalEngineer for recommendations on use of these types of PPE. Personnel will have to be qualified and must54AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006have participated in mask fitting for use of respirators. They should have undergone preliminaryHAZMAT training for use of SCBA. Figure 9.  After Initial Fire Rescue Efforts, the Bioenvironmental Engineer Will Identify the Level of PPE Requirements. Bioenvironmental engineers are the primary experts on determining immediate hazards and whether S&Rmembers need to use SCBA at the scene. Life safety action-type training should be handled on a regularbasis prior to any emergency response, with only PPE-use refresher training attempted during JIT train-ing. SAFETY CAUTION – Disposable Dust Masks.  Some disposable dust masks can provide a sufficient level of protection for some work around non-combustion particulates found near mishap wreckage.  However, they should not be used in place of fitted respirators, which are required for work within mishap wreckage and for close handling of remains.  Disposable particulate masks must be chosen with caution, as many nuisance dust masks are not approved for use in any post-mishap environment due to either poor fit or not being adequate for filtering.  Only use the proper (oil and non-oil based particulate and aerosol environment) approved Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) N, P and R rated masks with 95 to 100 ratings (with or without an exhalation valve).  “N” designates not oil resistant,  “R” designates oil resistant, and  “P” designates oil proof.   The 95 to 100 rating designates the efficiency ofthe filter for filtering out particulates only, notgases or vapors.  Pre-Response Actions. As with any operational or emergency action plan, the primary training and deci-sions on how to handle problems and support should be done well ahead of any emergency response. Thiswill eliminate delays, shortfalls, or limiting factors. CE engineer assistants (EAs) and the base multimediacenter alert (or duty) photographers should be a part of an overall homestation S&R training program toensure they can function as needed with Services. Even with the best planning and contacts by commandpost controllers, some personal pre-response contacts should be made to clarify actions prior to fieldwork. Pre-response contacts or efforts normally fall into at least five areas: emergency procurement, S&Rteam assignments, field mapping support, photographic support, and S&R team JIT training. AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 200655Emergency Procurement. The S&R team chief should always touch base with the contracting office anddetermine if they will have a representative available or at the scene to obtain urgent contract support.Until someone has actually been at the site to determine what hazards and conditions exist, the adequacyof S&R resources is unknown. Services and the contracting office must have a clear understanding ofwhat can be done to obtain urgent or emergency procurement for contingency situations. Purchase, leas-ing, and rental are usually options for obtaining many vehicles and heavy or specialized equipment.Whenever possible, Services and contracting should pre-identify sources for replacement PPE items notavailable on base. These items may have to be ordered as needed based on the team composition and sit-uation. S&R team assignment. Circumstances will dictate whether (1) all core and assigned S&R team membersare needed at the same time, (2) members will work in shifts, (3) some members or teams will conduct thesearch while others work the recovery, and (4) additional augmentees are required for longer efforts. Thisalso leads to assignment of core team members as team leaders and trainers for the additional members.Untrained augmentees must be reviewed and brought into the CISM efforts and have proper PPE andtraining. Some members may have to be tapped for field recording, close handling of remains, fieldsketching, and administrative support for remains handling. Field mapping support. All mishap-site mapping must be accomplished in coordination with the ISB/SIBMedical Officer, Civil Engineers, and the S&R team. If the loss site is related to a possible criminal or ter-rorist investigation, then the investigating agency with jurisdiction must also be involved with any map-ping decisions. Contact CE to determine if qualified CE EAs will be available to conduct the S&Rmapping. A real world worst-case situation may be that the EAs are deployed and there are no CE civil-ians to perform this work. This situation should be considered during pre-deployment planning to ensurethat there is some remaining capability to respond to mishaps, even if CE must obtain contract civiliansurveyors or obtain support from another military unit. When EA survey support is initially limited, survey-grade GPS is not available, or standard (total station)survey equipment is not available, many CE EAs and officers can: (1) provide various forms of field mea-surement and mapping using grids to produce detailed measurement information (for later compilationand drawing), (2) use distance wheels and tapes and other measurement techniques, (3) create date tablesof the measurements, and (4) scale draw layouts for mapped objects and reference points based on all thedata tables. Figure 10.  CE and Services Have Requirements to Create Sketches and Maps. Be aware that CE personnel supporting S&R should also receive critical incident stress screening and bein on your S&R briefings. Last minute substitutes may not have had CISM related support and this couldpresent some problems on site. 56AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006When a CE EA team is either not available or able to support an S&R team, such as when conducting anexpedient recovery, Services personnel should make their own field sketches of the location and identifykey objects and the boundary of the mishap (see Section 4). Pre-identify team members that have a goodcapability for perspective drawing and practice with them as a part of normal S&R homestation training.If it is likely that S&R teams will have to complete all their own sketching, such as for some contingencyresponses, Services should build an S&R response kit that also contains drawing supplies (pen, pencils,rulers, erasers, adjustable protractor, gridline and plain drawing paper), measuring equipment (such as anassortment of tapes (12-, 25-, 50-, and 100-foot) and a measuring wheel), and a folding table and chairthat can be used for drawing in the field, or obtain this equipment from CE (through prior arrangements). In a non-contingency environment, realize that the shortfall of CE being unable to support surveying andmapping capability usually must be corrected in time to support an SIB. Work with CE to ensure that theyare also working early-on to provide mapping support for your S&R site mapping needs. If CE is unableto provide survey-grade GPS support, then standard field surveying and detailed measuring techniquesmay have to be used to create diagrams. For contingency situations where CE cannot respond, Servicesshould plan on creating the diagrams and sketches and can use a polar or grid diagram method to plotremains. Polar diagrams are normally used for compact mishaps. The center of the remains or major impact pointbecomes the center of the sketch and distances and directions are plotted out from this. You need a direc-tional compass as well as measuring equipment and drawing tools. Grid diagrams are more common and use field determined grids with corner stakes. Normally grids arerectangular and several grids may cover a remains field. Oftentimes strings are pulled between corner gridpoints to help identify grid locations (you also need drawing tools). [For the purpose of this handbook, theterm remains field is used to designate a large number of partially intact and fragmented remains that arelocated closely together on a mishap site.] Figure 11.  Compact Mishap Sites Can Present Challenges for Searching in Wreckage and Sketching the Scene. Grid searches may be followed up by CE using any survey-grade GPS, other surveying techniques, orsimple measuring equipment for distance marking from established grid corner points. AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 200657NOTE: When there are many remains in close proximity and no survey-grade GPS support is available, the above standard survey or manual distance measurement methods are preferable for marking numerous remains rather than trying to use a handheld precision lightweight mobile GPS receiver unit (PLGR GPS) or a similar handheld non-survey, non-mapping grade GPS unit.  Attempts to use non-survey-grade GPS readings to plot numerous individual remains in a tight remains field can introduce inaccuracies that are greater than the size of the remains field.  This happens primarily in mountainous and heavily forested or jungle areas and when there are unique atmospheric disturbances that make obtaining multiple satellite readings difficult or impossible.  To help increase accuracy and orientation, CE could take several extended-time readings with a PLGR GPS to establish longitude-latitude-altitude at primary features, key primary remains grid locations, and several search boundary locations to include on the final drawings.  CE should make sampling checks (with measuring tapes or distance wheels) to ensure that hand held GPS readings are providing accurate enough measurements to establish those points. Photographic support. Photographic support is a must have for forensic and SIB purposes. Contact thedeployed Joint Combat Camera representative or your CONUS or OCONUS base multimedia supportoffice’s alert photographer(s) who will cover the mishap scene. Determine their capability to remain onscene to support photo documentation of your marking efforts. Determine if they can provide still photoand video documentation. Photographers are normally under the initial control of the ISB MedicalOfficer (flight surgeon) and then under the ISB Investigation Officer (IO) before they transfer to supportthe SIB. However, they must also support S&R, so always contact the ISB IO to ensure the photographerswill still be available to provide support for S&R. NOTE: For events that require investigations of criminal or terrorist incidents, photographers may be provided and controlled by the military, federal, or state investigating organization.  Not all base photographers (whether military, civilian, or contract) are up to taking photos of the typeneeded to photo-document remains. Since they may be on scene for an extended time period, considerhaving a first response team member or augmentee trained for some photographic support in case the pho-tographer is no longer able to continue, such as due to injury or on-scene critical incident stresses. Atremote locations or in many terrain locations, the remains may not wait for a replacement base photogra-pher to show up or for the OAFME photographer to arrive and take their photos. The on-scene photogra-pher may require some type of support mechanism to continue working during S&R efforts. Determinewith the ISB IO or Medical Officer if the supporting photographer received critical incident briefings andpre-exposure preparation. The photographer may need to sit in on the S&R team’s CISM debriefings andaccompany the team as an S&R member. S&R teams have enough to do in the field and do not need totake on additional photographic responsibility if this can be avoided by keeping the photographers CISMhealthy. (See Appendix D if Services must provide their own photographic support.) S&R team JIT training. From the initial knowledge of the mishap and each team chief’s reports on teamstatus, begin to inform the team members of the situation and prepare them with any required necessaryJIT. This should include use and wear of PPE, other safety equipment, and expected search and recoverytechniques and equipment that may be needed. Team members should have already been screened and befamiliar with CISM. However, determine if there are any ongoing influences or problems that couldoverly stress them and conduct additional briefings and discussions to make sure they are ready. Assign58AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006team positions and responsibilities and review checklists to determine if there are any last training areasto review. Again as a reminder (if it was previously unknown during your initial notifications), when you determinethat the loss situation involves dismemberment and/or multiple fatalities, ensure that your pre-responseactions include the previously stated preparatory notifications.  AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 200659Mortuary Officer Initial Site Assessment. The Services commander (as the mortuary officer (MO)) is aprimary member of the follow-on support forces for a fatal mishap. The MO must respond when it hasbeen determined that local civilian authorities will not provide for initial or all S&R support. The MOshould also respond when the Air Force does not have jurisdiction in order to establish liaison with thecivil authorities and coordinate providing any Services’ related S&R support. The MO’s on-site assess-ment should include the major considerations of time, terrain, temperature, trajectory, threats, and trans-portation. Based on their locale (whether at a CONUS or OCONUS base or a deployed AEF location), theMO should develop response plan checklists to cover the above major consideration. After a detailed review, the MO develops working plans to cover mortuary field support. This normallyinvolves setting up a mortuary operation facility to temporarily process, identify, and store-hold remains.Ideally, if you have the resources you would set up a mortuary operation (1) using major items from anLWRRG UTC kit (or equivalent resources), (2) within either a four-section TEMPER tent or the SmallShelter System, (3) with either a military or equivalent commercial refrigerated storage (or insulated stor-age box with dry ice), (4) powered by a generator (if commercial power is not available), (5) with ade-quate area lighting, (6) with a water supply, (7) with access for truck and forklift operations, (8) with gooddrainage and runoff protection, and (9) with ventilation (such as an environmental control unit). A con-taminated waste collection tank would be required for most CONUS and OCONUS locations. Figure 12.  You May Need a Contingency-Type Mortuary at Some Mishaps. The MO must decide what is the necessary level of support and decide with the mission support groupcommander (or other equivalent designated mishap authority who may be responsible for overall support)if this is possible, or if there are other alternatives. If the location falls under a local jurisdiction, mortuary operations may not be required. In this case, coor-dinate with the medical examiner with authority to determine their plans and offer support as needed or beavailable for counsel if appropriate. If the mishap area is within a densely or rather densely populated area(especially for aircraft mishaps), the local emergency response procedures and authorities nearly alwaystake immediate precedence. This is a situation that normally requires not just MoAs and MoUs, but alsocoordinated response plans that have been thoroughly tested during joint exercises. Work with localauthorities in all ways possible. Normally the fire department is a major participant in joint responses.Develop a good working relationship with your base’s fire chief. Firefighting personnel can help provideon-scene guidance and information regarding overall emergency response situations involving casualties60AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006and the condition of remains. They normally work with the responding medical officer (flight surgeon) onthe condition of the remains. Figure 13.  Firefighters Can Provide Some of the Best, Earliest Assessments of the Situation. In a jurisdiction or at a site that will require remote temporary mortuary support, determine: (1) the levelof mortuary processing and support needed, (2) size of the support teams required, (3) whether mortuaryand S&R efforts will be shared, (4) the location and types of facilities and equipment that will be needed(including refrigerated storage), (5) the basic layout, (6) site access and control methods, and (7) security,including avoidance of direct public or media viewing. Since processing and tentative identification may extend until the OAFME has completed on-sceneefforts, do not limit support planning to just what is needed for S&R. Get with CE, logistics readiness, andthe contracting representatives as soon as possible to let them know the expected requirements and deter-mine how best to provide support. CE may have to deploy a support team with some electrical and utilitiessupport capability for beddown efforts. Determine if there are any limitations, such as lack of supportcapabilities. For legal issues, get with the JAG. Also discuss efforts with the mission support group com-mander, who can address filling requirements or identifying possible alternatives. Determining Mishap Related Information. If there is no formal on-site briefing, the S&R team chiefmust obtain information from the best sources available (whether they have jurisdiction or not) regarding:(1) the type of mishap or aircraft mishap, (2) the number of personnel involved or souls on board, (3) whatare the conditions of remains (obtained from the medical authority and responding fire rescue personnel),(4) what are the remaining biomedical and chemical hazards on scene, (5) are there any explosive ord-nance-propellant-fuel hazards on scene, (6) is there more than one area with remains, (7) if there is animpact crater are remains expected to be in the crater and is this a confined area that requires additionalPPE, (8) are composite materials involved, and (9) if any nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons areinvolved or suspected. View the site and determine if any other Services related support will be required in addition to S&R. Ifso, then make a decision now as to whether you will work related support or S&R operations. For com-plicated major mishaps, the responding Services officer should avoid trying to split early efforts into per-forming as the Services officer, commander, mortuary officer, log of events monitor, and S&R team chief.Trying to multitask these efforts can make it very dangerous for the S&R team. Assign others to workrelated support or place the S&R OIC or NCOIC in charge of S&R. As soon as possible while at the site,determine what basic teams will be required. Contact the S&R OIC or NCOIC and have the team leadersbegin notifying team members, placing them on standby, or recalling personnel. Let them know that theyneed to provide S&R support and whether they will be staying in the field or working from homestation.Have the team leaders initiate team leader actions and begin preparing for any just-in-time efforts. AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 200661Site Conditions and How to Conduct the Search. Based on the type of terrain and the scatter of wreck-age and remains, decide on the primary method or methods for search and recovery that are possible andfeasible. Details on actual search methods (i.e., standard area sweeps, lane sweeps, grid searches, cra-ter-impact area searches, and building room-hallway searches) are presented in Section 4. NOTE: Home station training should be where you review and practice search methods and recovery techniques.  Knowing your proven capabilities when on the scene for the initial site assessment will better allow you to determine how you can conduct the search as you are standing at the mishap site.   Consider (and enter into the log of events) the current weather conditions and temperature, as well as theexpected conditions (forecast) for the next few days. This may greatly influence the search methods andrecovery timing. Consider that for nearly vertical impacts that bury or crater, compact remains searchescan be used most effectively. However, determine if a crew member may have ejected unsuccessfullyprior to impact. This could drive several separate types of S&R. For more horizontal impacts that scatterdebris in a linear fashion (along the direction of the flight path), standard sweep searches are normallyused if not restricted by terrain. Figure 14.  A Linear but Broadly Scattered Mishap May Require Only One Search Technique. If the mishap involved numerous personnel, such as passengers on transport aircraft or a terrorist attackon a convoy or mass transit vehicle, consider that you could have concentrated remains near large fuse-lage or vehicle segments, but still have many scattered-fragmented remains caused by the impact orexplosion. This could drive the need to have separate types of S&R and additional S&R personnel. Figure 15.  One Mishap May Require Several S&R Techniques Based on Terrain, Type of Aircraft, and Trajectory. Take time when on site to visit what has been identified as a possible or actual remains location. Sketchthe mishap site and mark the tentative remains locations and major mishap features. Some locations may62AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006have identifiable and largely intact remains, as well as broad intervening areas with unrecognizableremains scattered amongst debris and wreckage. It is very important that (1) all search efforts be identi-fied, (2) separate efforts be coordinated, and (3) team leaders be assigned to specific areas with specificfunctions. Team leaders must follow specific techniques that are appropriate for their specific remainslocation. They must evaluate the current skill levels and the level of PPE needed for their specific remainslocation. Although the mishap may be one occurrence, as a safety practice each remains location should be evalu-ated to determine proper PPE and S&R procedures. All remains and personal effects markers must still beintegrated so there is no duplication (or confusion) between remains locations. Separate, detailed remainsrecovery sketches-diagrams can be drawn for each specific remains location at the overall mishap site.These would then be consolidated later into an overall mishap scene diagram for inspection report pur-poses. The normal S&R process (as assisted by others) is to (1) search for the remains and personal effects, (2)stake and S&R tag (see Appendix E) each finding, (3) shoot a survey point or take measurements for eachtag location, (4) photograph the remains close-up and in perspective to the major site features prior toremoving remains, (5) sketch the site, and (6) remove the remains (bag and attach tags). A detailed siteremains map-diagram can be completed later. Identification is determined by others whether in CONUSor OCONUS. These normal S&R events are shown only in basic order. The normal S&R process may not be possible or feasible for a given situation. Then you need to ask your-self what can you do to accomplish S&R? In some cases the local jurisdictional authorities may dictatemost or all of the procedures. However, when you have to run S&R and make the decisions, you and theincident or mishap on-scene commander must decide how to conduct the search and when to recoverremains. In some cases, conditions may require remains marking and recovery to be concurrent with the search. Doyou (and the other responders supporting the overall efforts) have the assets, authority, and training toconduct search, marking, photography, sketching-plotting-measuring, and removal as a concurrent effort?Especially during a contingency operation, you may be in a situation and under conditions where youhave to recover remains and personal effects expeditiously, including prior to any SIB or OAFME person-nel arriving on-scene. Concurrent recovery is normally the call of the ISB’s Investigation Officer, MedicalOfficer, and the responsible (on-scene) commander, who have to assume authority to safeguard both theremains and/or the ability to investigate the mishap. Although not an all-encompassing list, the followingconditions may require concurrent S&R. It is very important that the senior Services S&R team leader (on the scene of an OCONUS loss) advisethe acting authority (such as the SIB/AIB president) that remains should be kept refrigerated and heldat the site (or another central place) until S&R is complete. This does two things. It avoids having tomake multiple shipments to the port mortuary. More importantly, it helps to avoid unnecessary additionalstress on the person authorized to direct disposition (PADD) and other family members, who would worrymore about the death and the condition of the remains. Retaining remains during the S&R process helpsto limit or avoid the more tragic situation of the PADD being notified that partial remains have beenreceived at the port, that the remains have been identified as their service member, but the family shouldprobably wait before accepting the remains for burial, because there is a strong possibility that other areremains will be recovered during ongoing S&R efforts. AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 200663Table 5.  Reasons for Search and Concurrent Recovery. Reason Comment 1. The terrain and weather are such that    rain or extreme conditions may cause     the immediate loss of remains and    personal effects.   2. Individual team actions (ISB, S&R, SIB)    will create an imminent threat or cause    the loss of wreckage, remains, and    personal effects.   3. When the remains are in public plain     view, intact or substantially intact,     identifiable, not commingled, and     cannot be otherwise protected or     screened from view; the remains may be     removed to maintain dignity.   4. The remains are highly fragmented (even     if commingled) and are subject to rapid     decomposition due to heat and     humidity.   5. Remains will be subject to further    damage or loss by fire, exposure to     industrial type contamination or     chemicals (i.e., corrosives, oxidizers,     propellants or other fuels, etc.).   6. Remains are in a high threat contingency     location and expedient S&R is needed     (by Services or another unit).   7. The mishap scene or portions of it are     subject to uncontrollable scavenging by     predators or varmints 8. Due to bloodborne pathogen or other    biomedical hazards, leaving the remains    will present an undue hazard to    responding personnel who must be on    site.  Terrain such as steep or loose talus slopes, unstable earth slopes, unstable snow slopes, or areas with rocky overhangs can collapse with each effort of ISB, S&R, and SIB team members.  Caveat.  Based on jurisdiction, a competent medical authority should determine that investigation evidence would not be lost and that marking, photography, and removal would be adequate for investigation. This should not be a major consideration if training is adequate and proper PPE is available. Unless your base has developed and included directions for an ISB (within a comprehensive responseplan) on how and when to remove and mark remains, there are no definitive directions. Removal of64AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006human remains is addressed in Air Force Pamphlet 91-211, USAF Guide to Aviation Safety Investigations.The defining portion is stated here. Excerpt from AFPAM 91-211 (23 July 2001): 5.8.3. Site Preservation. The ISB and SIB must ensure the site is stabilized to prevent loss of evi-dence. However, there may be compelling reasons to remove some crucial evidence from the scene quickly. 5.8.3.1. Disposition of Human Remains. Ideally, human remains (as opposed to survivors) should be left in place until a trained investigator can document their locations, condition, etc. However, for humanitarian, jurisdictional, and practical reasons, there is usually pressure to remove human remains from a scene promptly, so the ISB and/or recovery/rescue personnel may not wait until the full SIB has assembled. Further, in some climates, it could be essential to the health and safety of those working in the vicinity of the wreckage to remove remains rapidly. The following steps should be conducted by or under the supervision of the ISB or SIB’s medical member: 5.8.3.1.1. Before moving any human remains, jurisdiction for those remains must be clarified. In most cases, the local coroner/medical examiner will have jurisdiction (legal control) over the remains. Ideally, jurisdiction issues for geographic areas surrounding military installations and ranges should be delineated ahead of time during mishap response planning. Most FAA Regional Medical Examiners maintain a database delineating the areas of jurisdiction and may be of assistance in clarifying these issues. 5.8.3.1.2. Proper personal protective equipment (PPE) must be worn to protect against blood-borne pathogens, composite materials and other potentially hazardous aerospace materials. The extent of PPE should be determined by the medical member with appropriate consulta-tion, as needed, by a bioenvironmental engineer. 5.8.3.1.3. Before moving any human remains, the medical member is responsible for detailed site diagramming coordinated with specific clearly labeled stakes and photographs showing pertinent detail. 5.8.3.1.4. Because personal life support and escape equipment is intimate with the remains, carefully photograph and examine these items if their removal is required. 5.8.3.1.5. Remove human remains only after completely documenting and closely scrutinizing all surfaces of remains with on-scene photography. Ensure photographs include adjacent struc-tures, which could account for traumatic injuries or objects which show evidence of tissue transfer. 5.8.3.1.6. The gross position, posture, and condition of crash victims are valuable evidence. Questions often can be resolved with photographic evidence of the location of human remains, e.g., the location of crew members in relation to the cockpit can help determine who occupied each crew position. In the case of multi-pilot aircraft without cockpit voice recorders, it is often difficult to determine who was flying the aircraft without such information. When possible, if remains must be removed prior to arrival of the SIB, then remains should be removedconcurrent with at least a preliminary marking effort. The ISB Medical Officer should meet with theS&R team chief and photographer to ensure that the remains are (1) marked, (2) photographed, and (3) thelocation can later be surveyed (or measured and recorded). Again, the senior Services S&R team leaderAFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 200665should advise, especially for OCONUS situations, that all the remains should be kept together and refrig-erated before release. If early removal of the remains is required, the alert photographer should shootvideo (whenever possible) of the scene prior to and periodically during concurrent S&R. However, it isnot a requirement to delay removal of remains to bring in the CE survey team when the site can be prop-erly staked (or flagged) and tagged by the ISB and S&R team. Efforts should be made to ensure that thestakes-flags will not be lost or removed prior to surveying. When properly marked, survey-grade GPSreadings can be made by CE EAs. If no GPS system is available, CE or Services should take readings forGPS locating purposes (even if only a PLGR GPS is available) within the best possible accuracy of thehandheld GPS unit. Take the readings on several key mishap scene parts or markers to provide longitude,latitude, and elevations (if possible on sloping terrain). Figure 16.  Assigning Responsibilities and Providing Proper PPE is Essential in Human Remains S&R. Since each type of terrain may present various options or limitations in using specific search methods,mapping and sketching efforts, and the timing for recovery, you should carefully review the primarysearch considerations and equipment needs that were presented in Table 3. and Table 4. Review these tomake sure the teams are ready and equipped for specific types of searches. Then, make your final deci-sions on search methods and team members. Determine Specific Logistical Requirements. Based on the just determined search methods and recov-ery techniques, the S&R team chief starts obtaining mishap-specific logistics. Begin with the team itselfand determine how many personnel will be required for how long. Then consider S&R support items,transportation of team members and remains, and near site support. Table 6. provides guidance. 66AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006Table 6.  Specific Logistics Requirements. Support Area Personal equipment and PPE 1.Specifics Identify to team leaders the expected details ofthe stay so they can ensure that all team mem-bers  possess  or  can  obtain  enough  personalitems to support them in the field and during theoperations.   Processing and Storing Remains 2. Common items may include sleeping bags, toi-letries,  suntan  lotions,  medications,  eyeglasses,and on and off duty clothing (to suit the locationand circumstances). 3. Personal items should mirror a standard deploy-ment kit, except that members may have to bringquite a few extra personal items such as under-wear, socks, and t-shirts to allow proper hygienein  conditions  that  may  not  warrant  laundry  forthese small items. 4. Members  need  to  make  personal  preparationsfor being away from homestation or the deploy-ment base.     5. Make  sure  that  there  are  enough  PPE  items  tosupport  the  core  and  other  participating  mem-bers in the operation (see Table 4. guidance onPPE requirements).   1. Off-base:  Determine  the  jurisdiction  require-ment for handling remains.  Temporary on siterefrigerated  storage  may  be  required  prior  tocivilian movement. If remote and off-base: A mortuary tent opera-tion  and  refrigerated  storage  may  be  required.Human remains pouches are required, as well asplastic bags for fragmented remains. 2.3. On-base:  Emergency  action  plans  shouldaddress this.  Unless there is a local agreementfor  off-base  support,  use  base  capabilities  asmuch  as  possible,  especially  if  it  will  take  alonger time to recover and identify fragmentedremains.    Consider  a  base  hospital  mortuary,  adeployment asset refrigeration unit, a section ofa refrigerated area, a refrigerated van, or an areathat can be isolated and have a portable refriger-ation unit brought in.  AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 200667Support Area Transportation of Remains Transportation of Personnel Specifics This may be an ongoing, phased effort that could involve local jurisdictions, Medical Group, Services, and Contracting. 1. On  site:  This  depends  on  the  location  andwhether the remains are intact, primarily intact,or fragmented. a. A closed or covered pickup truck, SUV, orambulance may be used to transfer remainsto an on-site mortuary operation for process-ing and refrigerated storage.   b. For  very  rough  terrain,  an  all-terrain  RVcapable  of  carrying  a  litter  with  humanremains pouches may have to be used. 2. Long  distance travel  without  refrigeration.Determine if using and obtaining transfer casesis  feasible  and  necessary  if  you  must  use  ice.Transfer  cases  are  normally  only  used  OCO-NUS,  but  may  be  required  based  on  circum-stances. 1.3. Other  transport  should  be  in  an  enclosed,  cov-ered  vehicle  with  either  air  conditioning  or  arefrigerated box (to suit the length of travel).   If S&R personnel  are traveling to the site as agroup,  they  should  be  transported  by  bus.    Aseparate vehicle, such as a truck, should be pro-vided  to  transport  supplies  and  equipment,  ifneeded. 2. Vehicles should be suitable to the conditions atthe S&R site and must be capable of being thor-oughly cleaned and decontaminated if personnelwill be exposed to hazardous materials and can-not be adequately decontaminated on site. If in the local base area, obtain motor pool trans-portation as tasked in base support plans.  3.68Support Area S&R Operations AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006Specifics 1. Search.    Determine  the  methods  and  areas  andthe specific field use equipment, marking meth-ods and equipment, and PPE required.   a. Determine  with  Communications  and  CEReadiness  the  methods  to  contact  the  mainsupport base (if remote).   b. On site  communications  with radios,walkie-talkies,  or  other  methods  must  beplanned  given  the  site  layout,  obstructions,and separation distances. 2. Recovery.    Determine  the  equipment,  PPE  (asdirected  by  the  Bioenvironmental  Engineer),marking  methods  and  supplies,  and  surveyingcapabilities.  Determine if Services may have toprovide their own distance marking for later usein official diagrams. 3. Sketches and diagrams.  Even if CE EAs will bepresent,  creating  your  own  initial  workingsketches for the location (and within individualgrid,  crater,  or  building  room-hallways)  canspeed things up for recovery members. 4. Special support.   a.

On-base.  Provide for MREs, box meals, or hotmeals at the location from the base dining facil-ity. 2. Off-base nearby.  Determine how to get meals topersonnel on site from local vendor or base din-ing facility.  MREs may be used initially.  Allowmembers to use personal quarters.  Set up a mor-tuary or support tent-shelter only if required.   3. Off-base remote.   a. Contract quarters for the team.   (ii)(i) When  commercial  lodging  is  used,meals  must  be  planned  for  morning,lunch, and dinner.   It may be possible to have the morningmeal near lodging or on site, lunch canbe  catered  or  purchased  from  closestvendors,  and  evening  would  be  nearlodging.   (iii) Set up a mortuary or support tent onlyif required. b. On-site tents or shelters.   (i) Use  deployable  assets  for  lodging,shower-shave,  and  latrine,  except  thatwater storage and waste holding tanksmay be required.   (ii) Meals would be prepared on site: traymeals  whenever  possible  but  boxlunches  okay.

Depending on the remoteness of the location, abeddown  operation  may  be  required  for  morethan just the mortuary operation.   2. Whether or not at-the-site lodging and meals areprovided  (which  would  necessitate  providingshower-shave and latrine units or support), con-sider the need for: a. Showers. b. Air conditioning for relief from heat or heat-ing for relief from cold. c. Sheltered chemical toilets or portable toilets.  d. Hand wipes (if water is in limited supply ordrainage is a problem) and trash containers.   This should be a coordinated Services and CE effort to determine the level of support on site for responders and S&R team members.  AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 200671Support Area On-siteAdministration Specifics You do not want to become a slave to providing hourly electronic updates of S&R.

Remote Locations and Mass Fatalities May Require Extensive Logistics Support and On-Site Mortuary Operations. Brief the Team on the Situation. The S&R team chief will normally provide this briefing upon return tothe base (unless required to remain at the site). The briefing should be based on the site visit and informa-tion obtained from the flight surgeon, fire department, EOD, and as discussed with the bioenvironmentalengineer. Identify the search area entrance and exit points. Provide information on the status of remainsand condition of remains. This should be expanded to include a short refresher (for previously trainedcore personnel) on anatomical recognition for any known to be missing or fragmented remains. Includeinformation on: (1) the team numbers and makeup, (2) the mishap location, (3) debris boundaries andknown or expected remains boundaries, (4) size, shape and terrain of search areas, (5) individual teamsearch areas, and (6) any special responsibilities or cautions. Tell them whether or not concurrent recovery72AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006will be required, and if so, who is detailed for specific tasks. It is appropriate to brief the believed-to-be(BTB) names (if known) in the event that an S&R team member knows, was close to, or worked with theBTB person. In that event, the S&R member could be removed from the search team PRIOR to going tothe scene. Identify who will be on site (i.e., the ISB, security, fire department, OSI or other special agents, etc.) andwho has jurisdiction or control if conducting a shared civilian-federal-military effort. Identify how thesearch areas will be marked, the initial direction of search and spacing between S&R team members, andthe patterns-methods-equipment to be used. Make sure that your teams know who the other teams are whowill be working on site and why they are on site. Confusion is dangerous and can also impact the supportfor next of kin when it is time to determine disposition of remains and (on-scene) personal effects. NOTE: OSI, state, and federal investigators may have their own marking procedures for evidence, which must be coordinated with your S&R procedures for remains and personal effects.Identify the S&R OIC and NCOIC who will be on site and what they will do. Team members should knowwho each S&R team’s leader is. For sweep searches, there should be two flankers and enough line peopleas designated to cover the search area. Depending on the location and separation, flankers should beequipped with portable megaphones, whistles, compasses, sketch maps, a machete or hand ax, and a radioor walkie-talkie. Each S&R team chief and team leader should have a walkie-talkie or portable radio for communication incase assistance is required. Ask if team members know of any other PPE needs or specific procedures thatshould be followed. Refresher Briefing on Critical Incident Stress Management (CISM) Concerns. Based on the situationbrief, team leaders should have a better idea of the stresses that members will be facing. There are at leastfour areas to review. AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 200673Table 7.  CISM Refresher Briefing Review Areas. # 1 Description of the Review Area Let yourself know you are feeling stress and let others know you are feeling stress.  Talk about your feelings of stress.  Stress repressed becomes stress expressed, but usually in a physical or emotional way that interferes with being able to perform.  Know and practice positive stress behaviors.  Know and stay in touch with your purpose, team members, and a chosen buddy.  Accurately identify what you can and cannot control on site.  Review some of the ineffective coping mechanisms (insufficient sleep, nourishment, or fluid intake; use of alcohol and abuse of medications or drugs; breakdown in respect for the chain of command, lawful orders, directives, and communication).   Review the more likely traumatic sites and surprise events that could happen during the recovery. 2 3 4 During the initial and follow-on CISM briefings, let team members know that they should contact the LifeSkills Support Center (LSSC) at any time if they have coping problems that develop after an S&R event.The LSSC can provide support or coordinate support with CISM-companion agencies to address prob-lems that arise related to CISM (i.e., anger, depression, anxiety, stress, couple and family coping, conflictresolution, etc.). Team Leader Actions. Based on the briefings and taskings, the team leaders need to take more specificactions. 74AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 20062 3 Table 8.  Team Leader Specific Actions. Description of the Specific Action # Ensure team members respond with sufficient personal items in the event1 of multi-day deployment.   Ensure the appropriate S&R equipment is assembled.   Acquire team transportation to and from the S&R area.  Try to limittravel by foot as much as possible.   Brief and account for all team members and determine any physicallimitation given the final taskings.   Coordinate with CE to go over the efforts that teams will use in thesearch areas and determine how to best document the efforts on maps.   Begin a detailed log of events and requirements.   Obtain primary and alternate communications frequencies and schedulesto be used at the mishap location and in route as necessary.   Assign individual task responsibilities for each team member to ensurethat as soon as you reach the site, you can begin beddown (as necessary)and distribution, deployment, and/or reading of equipment and PPE. 6 7 4 5 8  AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 200675Deploy the Team. It is always preferable to deploy all team personnel together along with their equip-ment. This prevents having to split kits and supplies and allows all equipment to be deployed. NOTE: Some base missions and locations make it more likely that limitations will be placed on the number of personnel and the amount of equipment that can initially deploy (such as when using helicopters or a limited number of heavy military trucks or special purpose vehicles).  When it is likely that remote S&R operation recovery is required using limited or special transportation, S&R teams should consider breaking their team kits into smaller, more transportable sets.  PPE and tools may still have to be pulled from a general stock of supplies and placed into kits, but this normally would not happen until the actual initial deploying members and the situation are known.  Table 9.  Suggested Transportable Sets. Kit Initial team kit Primary Requirement Provides limited capability (i.e., a small-scale initial response kit for one 13-person team) for search, tagging, staking, and marking, with some initial remains recovery and small-scale refrigerated storage. PPE and special tools pulled from inventory based on the situation. Remainder of search-tagging-staking-marking set. PPE and additional special tools pulled from inventory based on the situation. Infrastructure for long-term operations at a site (generators, rest and medical tents, supply storage, special purpose vehicles, additional tools, sifting boxes, etc.). Hazardous material and/or waste containers. Infrastructure for set up of field mortuary collection point for processing remains, short- or long-term refrigerated storage (refrigeration units, generators, refrigerated vans, etc.), and water. Waste collection/handling and hazardous material and waste containers. Measuring and drawing kit with paper, drawing supplies, measuring tapes and wheel, small folding table and chair. Large-scale team search kit  Large-scale recovery kit Mortuary set Site schematic set The S&R OIC/NCOIC and team leaders should use checklists for personnel, PPE, and equipment toensure that all required resources are loaded into transportation. If the length of travel is long, water and76AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006some snack items or meals may have to be loaded with the transport. Plan to bring at least one day’sworth of MREs and water when there are any concerns about possible delays in setup of resources. Formore remote locations, consider bringing additional water and MREs as well as small tented enclosureswith chemical (bucket) type toilets, toilet paper, and wet wipes. Site Setup and Beddown Actions. The initial site visit should reveal if and where local, nearby, orat-the-site support will be needed for lodging, food, mortuary, and emergency medical on-site support.Depending on where support will be provided and the amount of time available to begin operations, begineither beddown or setup. You may have to stage from (1) the mishap location, (2) your main support vehicle or a tent, or (3) nearbylodging. Determine where you will require setup and begin unloading and arranging team kits and PPE. Ifyou have to setup tents or shelters in addition to conducting S&R, make sure that CE has deployed suffi-cient support forces to help get this underway with enough Services personnel. Action plans should indi-cate how many CE and Services support personnel need to deploy. If Services S&R must beginimmediately, CE may have to perform more of the beddown efforts. Upon arrival at the mishap scene,determine where the entry checkpoint is and provide a list of personnel who will be taking part in S&Roperations. Also identify any key personnel and methods of contact. Receive an update on the conditionsand hazards. Clearance to Proceed at an Aircraft Mishap, Other Fatal Mishap, or Other Fatal Losses. Obtainingclearance to proceed with S&R will depend on the cause that necessitates an S&R response and whetherthe deceased member(s) include other branches of the armed forces. The approving authority to allowS&R entry may be the local off-base jurisdictional authority or the on-scene ISB authority (i.e., off- oron-base aircraft mishap), the military on-scene commander (such as for transportation mishaps or combatlosses), or military special agents and federal criminal investigating officials (such as for criminal acts andterrorist attacks) who may also be working with the OAFME. Decisions must be based on a formal deci-sion to allow entry after considering the remaining hazards. Whenever the S&R team chief is in doubt intoan area, ask to make sure that the location is still clear and if there are any hot spots (i.e., fires, chemicalor fuel spills, or other hazards) that require higher levels of PPE. Many normally benign items (i.e., tires,batteries, hydraulic accumulators, etc.) are potentially lethal in a post-crash environment and may have tobe avoided until they lose potential energy (such as created by an impact or fire). A bioenvironmental engineer on the response force, in conjunction with EOD and the fire department,provides guidance on the hazards specific for a given mishap prior to entry and for as long as required. AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 200677Figure 18.  Hazards Can be Easy to Miss, but Can Prove Dangerous to Searchers (flare on right). The following mishap investigation safety practices should be followed at most mishaps. Table 10.  Investigation Safety Practices. # 1 Safety Practices Expect HAZMAT to be present in any mishap until its presence has been ruled out.  Anyone authorized to work in and around a crash scene must constantly be alert to indications of the possible presence of HAZMAT, which should be marked with warning placards or signs, labels on packages, shipping papers, or verbal information from people at the scene.   2  Wait until potential energy transfers (such as fires, explosions, vapors, 3 4 breached radioactive materials containers, etc.) are eliminated, if HAZMAT is present.  Some benign items may not be initially evident and you could find them during the search.  Have them checked when found.   Stay away from wreckage containing HAZMAT until a competent expert has predicted the behavior of the HAZMAT at the mishap and ensured that it poses no threat to personal safety.  Obey any subsequent evacuation instructions of EOD, security forces/police, bioenvironmental engineers, and fire fighters.  In no event should S&R responders follow fire fighters or other emergency or rescue personnel into the wreckage area unless cleared to do so.  If on site and there is reigniting, stay at least 2,000 feet upwind from any fires burning in wreckage where HAZMAT are present and stay out of any plume of smoke from the site. Buildings and even shallow craters (under some weather conditions) can act as confined spaces whenS&R members need to recover remains. Always determine with a bioenvironmental engineer and the firedepartment if these type locations remain safe to enter. Working there may require wearing of higher lev-els of PPE and the use of exhaust fans to remove fumes or other pollutants and provide fresh air. 78AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006Search Methods: There are only a limited number of search methods that are employed for remainssearches. These are: (1) standard area sweep-cross sweep, (2) lane sweeps, (3) grid searches, (4) crater orcompact impact searches, and (5) building room and hallway searches. Figure 19.  A Standard Aircraft Mishap Scenario. Always remember that the responders and searchers must keep an accurate account (as best as possible with the on-site medical person) regarding the number count of remains. If there are a known number of souls-on-board and the search finds a total of the same number of souls (whether intact, primarily intact, or in the correct number of fragments), then the search could be terminated without covering the whole area. As with the clearance to proceed, termination of the search is a decision of the on-scene commander, civil authority with jurisdiction, or the authorized investigating officers. The on-scene medical officer or civil authority with jurisdiction (such as the ME) is to be informed of all remains being removed from the location. Even when a civil authority is in charge, the on-scene medical officer normally works with the local authorities to track and determine the status of remains. The S&R team chief must remain current on the status of remains recovery to provide status to S&R team members. This avoids teams from searching for remains they believe are still missing (i.e., remains not logged in) when the remains were actually recovered and transported off-site (without telling the search team). Figure 20.  Sweep Searches Are Best for Open Areas. Standard Area Sweep-Cross Sweep. This method is used when a larger area is open and unobstructedenough to allow a line sweep of personnel marching together. The bounded search area is traversed by ateam of personnel walking between two flankers. The team proceeds in a line along a set course andsearches for remains, each person responsible for a designated width in their line of march. When thesearch area (or box) has been searched in a parallel direction, then the sweeps are conducted for the searchbox in sweeps perpendicular to the first search. This is the search method that can be used most often andis also a faster method for searching open areas. AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006Figure 21.  A Standard Sweep Pattern. 79Lane Sweeps. This method is used in an area where the view is obstructed, there are obstacles that preventa line sweep, or there is a steep incline that prevents use of a line sweep. It is also used in snow fieldswhere a sweep will eliminate markings from the snow and greatly decrease the effectiveness of a crosssweep. When a lane search is used in an obstructed area, then tall siting posts (or poles or marker stakes)are driven into the ground and barrier rope or tape is stretched between the posts. A line of posts extendsfor the width on both ends of the search box. This breaks the search box into a series of marked narrowparallel lanes. S&R team personnel again form a search line that extends across the width of the lane andthere are additional search members in a team that trails the actual line. The search team line proceedsdown the lane. For areas that have many remains (i.e., a remains field) or are inaccessible and would dis-rupt the search team line, trailing members conduct a separate search at the obstacle or the remains field. Lane sweeps are also effective when working in swamp conditions, as standard sweeps and cross sweepsmay not be possible, feasible, or safe. Lane sweeps in swamps provide for lanes that can be physically laidout to better judge progress and location. Lane searches allow others to search the lane (such as in boatsor with cameras and divers) when the water becomes too deep for walking. It also allows a lane with moredebris to be sectioned off into smaller grids for more detailed searching and use of magnetometers, otherdetection equipment, and cadaver dogs. Deep-water lanes may require intermediate marker poles for ref-erence use by divers. 80AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006Figure 22.  A Standard Lane Sweep Scenario. Lane sweeps on a steep incline are sometimes used when the slope of a mountain or hillside will not allowteam members to climb the surface without using ropes and safety harnesses. The direction of the lanes(such as vertical to the slope or across the slope) depends on whether the slope is stable or unstable.Unstable slopes (i.e., loose talus, loose soil, or rock strewn mountainsides) often become more unstablefrom the aircraft impact and personnel walking on the surfaces. NOTE: A searcher walking on a loose talus or other unstable slope will normally cause the loose material to start sliding down the slope.  These slides can cover up debris or remains or injure search and investigation members lower on the slope.   AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006Figure 23.  Standard Lane Sweep Views. 81Except for life-saving efforts at the impact site, special approach methods must be considered when work-ing on unstable slopes. Approach is normally accomplished from the bottom of the slope workingupwards. Figure 24.  Lane Directions Can Vary Based on Stability and Type of Slope. SAFETY CAUTION – Slopes. When assessing and working any mishap or loss where slopes are involved, whether a mountainside or a crater, it is safer to start at the bottom and work up if it would be necessary to blindly step over obstructions. Obstructions could include wreckage, broken trees, or large rocks and boulders. You do not want to step blindly over an obstruction or wreckage, as you could be stepping on remains, jagged wreckage, evidence, hazardous materials, or a loose or slippery 82AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006surface (which could cause a fall and impalement of portions of the anatomy). Firefighting ladders can be used to traverse over some obstacles when there is no choice but to go down into a crater. Grid Search. A grid search is usually conducted in a smaller area that has limited accessibility, has poorvisibility, has a larger number of remains and wreckage, or is a remains field. This type of search is fre-quently used in snow-covered areas or areas that are heavily forested or have dense underbrush. Figure 25.  A Standard Grid Search Scenario. The overall search box is broken into a series of grids using corner marker stakes at each grid intersection.Individual grids are then searched by teams with fewer members who work side-by-side conducting adetailed search from one end of the grid box to the other. Figure 26.  Open (left photo) and Close-Quarter (right photo) Grid Searches. Crater and Compact Impact Area Searches. These searches are similar to a grid search in that the area ismarked off into several grid-marked areas. However, the large number of fragmented or fire-damagedremains, and often the large amount of wreckage, precludes the use of a normal grid search. AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 200683Figure 27.  A Standard Crater Search Scenario. Instead, search members move somewhat individually (or in buddy teams when working around compos-ite materials and jagged wreckage) from the outside of the grid toward the center. S&R team membersmay have to pull out small pieces of debris as necessary to further expose or free observable remains. Donot remove wreckage debris unless the actions are approved by an investigating officer. Figure 28.  Compact Impact Areas Require a Different Approach to Site Search Methods. For mishap areas that are within a crater, fuel and other hazardous materials may be present and are some-times more concentrated. Searchers may require forced fresh air, SCBA respirators, and higher levels ofPPE protection as determined by a bioenvironmental engineer. Craters also may present a greater problemwith uneven or unstable footing. 84Figure 29.  Crater View. AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006Building (Room and Hallway) Searches. Searches of buildings that have been damaged by natural events(tornadoes and earthquakes), fire, or explosives (terrorist bomb, aerial attack, or explosives handling mis-hap), must first be inspected for safety by specially trained personnel. Then, searching is usually accom-plished by small teams of Services S&R members who enter the buildings and move systematicallythrough each room and corridor, using grid or crater search techniques. Entering most damaged buildings(other than single story wooden structures and some lightweight steel, prefabricated structures) can placesearch members in an extremely dangerous situation. Greater levels of safety precautions must be usedand cadaver dogs may be required. Figure 30.  Typical Views of Some Damaged Building Interiors. Detailed On-scene Procedures.  In addition to the detailed procedures for the search, there are otherdetailed efforts that must be followed. Data sheets need to be kept while in the field for every tagged item of recovered remains, personal effects,and any specially labeled equipment. Include the tag number and a brief general description of theremains whenever chain of custody and evidence are required (examples: bag with white hand, bag withfoot in shoe, HRP with whole remains in uniform, bag with flight cap Captain’s rank, bag with charredflesh, bag with large leg bone and flesh, etc.). Oversight of tagging may even be a joint effort with militaryand federal investigators and medical examiners. The field data would be entered into the log of events,but must be created on site for investigations that require chain of custody trails. A signed copy of the logmay be required to remove remains and personal effects from cordoned, controlled areas where custodyof evidence is required. AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 200685Refine the site sketch for search methods. One of the first detailed efforts is to refine the sketch of theboundary and remains or remains fields. Then more closely establish the search area by driving stakes forboundaries, lanes, or grids. Mark the area for major sweep, grid, or lane points and plot those marks on thesketch (with a numbering system that fits your needs). If on site, CE can assist with or create the initialsketch and help drive stakes or other markers. CE can then shoot these key locations with a survey-gradeGPS while Services search teams are going into action. Mishap boards use these sketches and now cancoordinate them with photographic evidence. Electronic mishap reports use geographic information sys-tem (GIS) technology to associate information (i.e., photos, descriptions, shots of your markers, medicalexaminer (ME) or medical officer descriptions of the remains, and other attributes) with each mappedlocation. Official photographs are normally taken by others for the mishap boards (see Appendix D). S&Rteams should work with the photographer to make sure photos are taken of marked-tagged remains. Alternate data collection and sketch method. If CE does not have a survey-grade GPS or higher level totalsurvey station capability, or there are problems with equipment or personnel, consider using a grid-mea-surement approach to identify and mark objects, remains, and personal effects markers. A grid approachto data collection for the more critical remains locations allows CE, Services, or other personnel to usetape measures and record data. This data would be added to the mishap reports. A designated Services orCE person should sketch each numbered grid separately when more detail is required. NOTE: Some locations may be saturated with remains (i.e., a remains field, such as in a crater or burned out passenger fuselage section).  If it is not possible to plot each individual marker-point, plot the remains field and have the photographer carefully photograph the points and videotape the efforts if possible.   Refine your marking system methods. When there are many remains in a small area, trying to drive largerstakes can hinder operations. Large stakes should be used to designate grids, lanes, and intact or largelyintact remains. For a remains field with numerous fragmented remains, use standard stakes to designatethe outside of the area. Run barrier marking rope or tape or Occupational Safety & Health Administration(OSHA) flag banners to show where an area has many remains (and hazards if necessary). Then usesmall, high-visibility marker flags (on ground surfaces) or tape (such as on floors, walls, vehicle or air-craft metal surfaces). When you have completed searching a grid, then sketch the grid. At the end of theday (or search), combine the grids in one sketch or have CE do this as a part of their mapping effort. IMPORTANT NOTICE. Air Force Services Mortuary Affairs S&R nomenclature for marking intact remains, portions of remains, and personal effects has changed to the revised Joint Publication 4-06 nomenclature, with variations only as necessary. Depending on the mishap and your being able to obtain and stock resources ahead of time, you candevelop a color coding system using designated colors for flags, flagging, and tape for remains, personaleffects, and even any special equipment. See Appendix E for additional guidance on marking. Example.  Yellow, red, and orange for remains, portions of remains, and personal effects (respec-tively, except that you can limit remains and portions of remains to one color if needed). Investigators usually have their own marking methods, but if they need a different marking method, a blue flag could be used for special equipment identified by investigators. Permanent markers are used to write on the flag using the R-# designation for intact remains, P-# designation for portions of remains, and E-# designation for personal effects. If investigators do not have enough of their own marking kit des-ignations, then you can suggest that they also use a flag and another numbering system (such as an 86AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006S-#) for items ISB members or investigators designate as special equipment, personal effects (exam-ple: life support items), or evidence. (See Appendix E for specific marking procedures.) Figure 31.  Use of Flags for Remains, Personal Effects, and Investigator Marking. Detailed Techniques for S&R. This handbook does not present how-to detailed procedures for conductingS&R. General guidance is presented here and in Appendix F when considering S&R procedures. Detailed Procedures for a Standard Area Sweep-Cross Sweep. The search box is traversed by a team ofpersonnel, each of whom is responsible for a four-foot wide lane (i.e., two feet on either side of a line thatthe person is marching). Enough team members are used between two flankers (and with a team leader) toextend the width of a selected search width. The team proceeds in a line along a set course and stops itsforward movement as necessary to mark remains when found. Stakes or flags are typically used to iden-tify intact, primarily intact, and fragmented remains. The team leader or a designated follow-team mem-ber places an R-P-E-S designation on the stake or flag and records the item if known. Whenpredetermined, experienced line members may carry flags and flag the items. Upon reaching the end of adesignated search box, the team pivots around the inside flanker and travels in the opposite direction untilthe entire box is covered. This is then repeated if necessary starting at the end of the search box and mov-ing in a sweep line that is perpendicular to the first. This continues until the lengths and widths of the boxare again covered (if necessary). AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 200687Figure 32.  A Standard Sweep Line in Action. Detailed Procedures for Lane Sweeps. When there is an obstructed view or obstacles, then drive markerstakes or siting posts (taller grid marker stakes that can be seen better above brush) into the ground. Runbarrier rope or tape between the posts. The posts extend for the width of the search box. Lane searches canalso be used on rock-covered hillsides that are stable and not steeply sloped and for snow-covered loca-tions to better designate the location and line of march. NOTE: Because CE will need to survey the location lanes and marker points, it helps to have them on site to assist with the marking and clearing.  Because they could come into close proximity or contact with remains, CE personnel on site should all be under the CISM program.  They should only perform support with the assistance of the S&R OIC or NCOIC or a designated S&R core trained person, who is tasked to lay out the lanes for the location.  Figure 33.  Setting Marker Poles and Tall Stakes. Some lanes may have to be cleared with machetes and brush cutters to allow running lane and barrier ropeor tape. 88AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006Figure 34.  Brush Cutting to Allow Lane Marking. Within each narrow lane within the search box, S&R team personnel again form a search line that extends across the width of the lane. Flankers are used. Because it may not be possible to traverse the search box in the perpendicular direction, the width between members can be reduced from four-foot wide to just walking shoulder to shoulder when searching for and marking remains. Figure 35.  Lane Sweep in Brush. Other S&R team members walk directly behind the search line. The line proceeds down the lane andwhen they encounter an obstacle (such as a tree, bush, or large boulder), the line members continuearound the obstacle. However, the trailing S&R team members search the obstacle. For trees, this is nor-mally by viewing the tree with binoculars, climbing lower branches if necessary or possible, using a stepladder to clearly view the bush or tree, and marking trees (with colored flagging) to indicate that they mayrequire additional viewing from other angles (especially if remains are found nearby). For bushes and boulders, the obstacles are close searched to include: (1) using brush cutters and reachingdevices to gain access to some areas, (2) using ladders, or (3) climbing to confirm that there are no frag-mented remains present. AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 200689Figure 36.  Trailing S&R Team Searches Trees. When remains are found, the trailing team leader contacts the sweep line team leader to obtain the nextconsecutive number of the remains (or PPE or special identifications) and marks and tags the remains.Marking can include use of flags, stakes, and flagging to draw attention to the remains. Figure 37.  Trailing S&R Team Searches Obstacles. NOTE: Snakes may seek refuge from the search line by going under brush or other objects.  When trailing S&R team members search these areas, they need to show greater caution when in snake country.90AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006Figure 38.  Trailing S&R Team Members Also Have to Use Caution. Lane sweeps on steep inclines such as a mountain or hillside usually require special teams to assist orS&R trained team members to use climbing ropes and safety harnesses. The search direction must bedetermined as a part of determining PPE needs and search procedures. It is based on the location and thepossibility that rocks could be dislodged and create a hazard. Unstable slopes are the worst-case scenario,since they can collapse or slide under foot. When possible, searching of unstable slopes should be frombelow going up the slope. For more stable slopes, search members can use the lane approach going up or down the slope, but avoidstepping blindly over obstacles if going down a slope. Ropes are usually lowered down the slope fromsome advantageous location. When possible, ropes are manned by personnel at the top. If not possible, theropes must be anchored (such as from boulders), then search line team members can use a ratchet mecha-nism to raise themselves up the rope as they work the slope. The outside vertical edges of the expectedremains search area are marked with barrier tape. Another procedure that can be used if ropes cannot be extended down a slope is to suspend wire cables orclimbing ropes across the slope and have team members clip onto the rope with short tethered-ropes andharnesses. For stable slopes, barrier tape is used to mark lanes that extend up the slope from the bottom ofthe remains search area. Searchers in harnesses climb the face of the slope together in a line. Eachsearcher may have to look at an individual lane that could be at least six feet wide. Figure 39.  Experienced Personnel Use Standard Climbing and Anchoring Techniques. AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 200691SAFETY CAUTION – Use of Ropes on Slopes. Climbing rope and gear should be used to anchor search personnel. Only use barrier marking tape and not barrier rope to mark lanes unless the lane tapes can be anchored at the top (see Figure 40.). The only ropes used on a steep-slope location should be weight-certified climbing rope, except for small ropes that searchers can use to raise or lower light-weight equipment. Figure 40.  Stable-Slope Lane Searches Can Be Up and Down the Slope. For portions of slopes that are unstable, S&R efforts can be dangerous. Barrier tape should be run in nar-row lanes across the face of the slope (unless cross slope cables or climbing ropes with tethers are used). Figure 41.  Remains and Personal Effects Can be Hard to Find on Rocky Slopes. When required for safety, searchers wear harnesses and use climbing ropes to traverse across the face ofthe slope. Lower members of the search line take the lead and subsequent members follow at a safe dis-tance to prevent causing rock or debris to slide onto nearby personnel. Again, each searcher may have tolook at an individual lane more than six feet wide. 92AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006Figure 42.  A Standard Lane on a Steep Incline (Talus Slope). For loose, unstable slope conditions where remains can be covered up easily by shifting surface material(1) searching, (2) remains and personal effects photography, (3) key investigation debris and life-supportevidence identification, (4) marking with flags and flagging or tape, (5) shooting survey points, and (6)recovery of remains and some key evidence may have to be accomplished one lane at a time, basically asa closely sequenced or concurrent effort. ISB and support personnel may have to accompany the S&Rmembers to make decisions on tagging and removal of remains, personal effects, key equipment, and air-craft evidence if it is probable that slides could develop and cover evidence during S&R. Determine theneed to conduct concurrent efforts based on the movement of the slope and debris while entering the areaand consider that wet weather conditions could increase the slope instability. When possible, effortsshould be videotaped, as they may have to be used by SIB members to obtain information. Figure 43.  S&R May Have to be Concurrent with Surveying and Videotaping. SAFETY CAUTION – Fractured Composite Materials. Always be extremely cautious around composite materials on rocky or talus slopes, as they can be highly fractured due to the more vertical impact with the rocky surface. They can present a penetration hazard and, even if there was limited fire damage, can cause respiratory hazards. The fractured materials can slide down on searchers or be hidden among rocks, so it may be hard to avoid them when traversing the slope. Lane sweeps are used in deeper snows and allow a team of encumbered S&R personnel (wearing snow-shoes, carrying ski poles for balance, and wearing heavier clothing) to march slowly, shoulder to shoulderacross a lane looking for disturbed areas in the snow. Disturbed areas such as holes, discolorations, andAFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 200693surface scars in the snow may be indications of where wreckage, remains, and personal effects havelanded. Figure 44.  S&R in Snow May Require Some Adjustments in Procedures and Support. In deeper snows, lane sweeps can help clear larger areas more quickly, help eliminate them from furthersearching, and identify areas where more remains are concentrated. The remains field portion of the lanescan be further sectioned off and a grid search used. Access to and traversing the lanes can be difficult andexhausting. A warming and reconstitution tent may be required nearby. Detailed Procedures for a Grid Search. After determining the requirement for grid sizes and locations tocover the remains search area, begin creating the grids using corner marker stakes driven at each gridintersection and edge boundaries. The grids are marked with string, barrier or boundary tape, or even bar-rier rope to designate the area. Grids with hazardous materials or greater hazards should be bounded withOSHA barrier flags to designate that higher PPE should be used. The more remains in an area, the smallerthe number of grids that can be used. See Appendix E for guidance on marking and measuring withingrids. Grids are searched by smaller teams working side by side to conduct a detailed search from one end of thegrid box to the other. Searchers may have to use small tools and kneel down, so they should have PPE toprotect their knees, lower legs, and feet. Members may have to assist the person next to them in confirm-ing remains and marking them. For small areas with a larger number of fragmented remains, searchersmay have to work hunched over and carefully pick their footing to avoid stepping on remains. Someremains may have to be recovered concurrent with the search just to allow searchers to continue in asweep across the grid. In close quarters, CE EAs may have to take survey readings of the individualremains when removed. Otherwise, use flags as necessary to mark remains. 94AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006Figure 45.  Grid Search View with Many Fragmented Remains. Detailed Procedures for Crater (or Compact Impact Area) Searches. The area around a crater (or compactimpact area) should be roped off whenever possible to control site access. If necessary due to size, itshould be broken into grids to allow for better control and marking. See Appendix E for guidance onmarking and measuring within grids or craters. Because of the jigsaw nature of the remains and debris or crater materials, search members normally haveto move individually or with a buddy (especially when working around composite materials). When pos-sible, movement is from the bottom of the crater working upward or from the outside of an impact areaworking toward the center. Figure 46.  Control Crater Access with Barrier Tapes or Ropes. The initial search is for exposed or already observable remains. This method requires ISB investigationboard members (usually the IO and Medical Officer) to be present to identify key wreckage that should bephotographed and carefully preserved before being moved to gain access to the remains. EOD or firedepartment personnel may have to be nearby for safety. AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 200695Figure 47.  Crater Search with Observable Remains. NOTE: Crater or impact area searches are usually an initial search method for compact remains fields and partly observable remains.  It is not the same occurrence as during (or after) the SIB when a portion of wreckage is moved and additional hidden remains are found.  No matter which of the search methods are used, never search through and remove wreckage to allow removal of remains unless approved by investigating officers.When allowed to extricate remains from a debris or wreckage area, such as for marking the remains andmaking an anatomical determination of what the remains are, members may have to use hand tools, gar-den tools, reaching tools, and forceps to expose the remains. Using the proper tools and techniques willhelp preserve the remains and protect searchers from being exposed to bloodborne pathogens and sharpobjects. Figure 48.  Removal of Debris with Tools to Access Remains. For craters or impact areas with fuel and other hazardous materials, determine with bioenvironmentalengineers all the types of protection required. This could include bringing in fresh air, using different res-pirators (such as SCBA respirators), and changing the level of PPE. For crater slopes that are covered withsharp debris, searchers may have to use ladders to go down and over the slopes when searching forremains. When remains in craters have to be removed concurrent with the search, CE EAs may have totake survey readings of the key wreckage and individual remains when removed. Use flags as necessaryto mark individual remains and personal effects when they are concentrated in a small impact area. 96AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006Figure 49.  Take Precautions to Address Hazards in the Crater Such as Using Ladders, Ventilation, and Higher Levels of PPE. SAFETY CAUTION – Sifting Operations. Never begin a sifting operation, especially when there has been a fire, until it has been determined that composite materials are not involved. Fine composite materials can become airborne during sifting and this can create major respiratory hazards, cause injury to eyes, and lead to increased skin penetrations. If composite materials are present, the sifting operation may have to be located downwind from all other personnel and require higher levels of PPE, post-operation personnel decontamination, disposal of protective garments, and use of some form of fixant spraying to prevent dust. If the materials have been exposed to spilled fuel, be extremely cau-tious before beginning any sifting operations. Determine with the fire department if the sifting opera-tions could cause an increased risk of spontaneous combustion due to static electric sparking and increased oxygenation. Figure 50.  Take Precautions When Planning Sifting Operations. When a grid, crater, or compact area search is required in a snow-covered area where concentratedremains and wreckage are present, large tents may have to be used to enclose the area, protect the person-nel, and melt snow. Even if not used to melt the snow, snow may have to be loaded, sifted through withrakes or even large sifting boxes to find objects, and removed to a discard location. In some ways this typeof approach is like an archeological dig and close searching by removing layers of snow, debris, andremains may be required. Use caution around melting snow runoff from any melting operations, as theliquids can contain bloodborne pathogens and hazardous materials. Detailed Procedures for a Building (Room and Hallway) Search. While specially trained and equippedcounty, state, and federal urban search and rescue (USAR) personnel and canines often search damagedbuildings for survivors and for remains, few military personnel are fully USAR trained to provide thissupport. Air Force fire department personnel that respond to fire collapsed or damaged buildings havesome USAR training for search and rescue. Special local, state, and federal fire investigators may alsoAFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 200697enter these buildings with their special training. They may remove some remains when found, if theydetermine that it is safer and necessary for them to do so at the time. With the exception of a few types of single story structures, entering a damaged building can place searchmembers in an extremely dangerous situation. Depending on your location, a building structural assess-ment and USAR search should have been completed before a Services S&R team arrives. State and fed-eral teams are available to assist the military as a part of MoAs and other agreements. They would enterthe structure and mark for hazards (using a special FEMA USAR marking system to identify buildingcondition and body locations). The number of casualties is marked on the outside of the building. The sys-tem also identifies if and how it is safe to enter. Firefighters should be familiar with the FEMA USARmarking systems for structural assessment and victim identification. If not, be sure to enter only if you candetermine that a USAR search was conducted. If the building is at a location where there is no USAR support and search and rescue and search andrecovery are solely military efforts, then S&R may require variations in the pre-entry efforts. Searches forvictims and remains must still be a well-coordinated effort that ensures the building is safe. Usually athorough inspection is required and qualified CE personnel may have to brace and shore some sections toallow entry. Also, hazardous materials must be identified. Burned soot, asbestos or other fibrous materi-als, concrete dust, damaged pretension rods (which can fail explosively if touched), overstressed struc-tural members, and even composite materials can all be present within a damaged building and can varyconsiderably from hallway to hallway. NOTE: Search teams with supporting personnel should enter the facilities only with the proper levels of PPE.  This should be determined by checking with a bioenvironmental engineer after qualified inspectors and safety personnel have signed off on entry for the various locations within the building.   Figure 51.  Building Search Teams and Special Support Personnel May Enter as Teams. Even when the structure has been declared safe for entry, S&R teams should move through the damagedstructure accompanied by special support personnel. The S&R teams enter the buildings and move sys-tematically through each room and corridor using open or shoulder-to-shoulder lane and grid search tech-niques as applicable. Depending on the jurisdiction, especially when building damage is not related to anaircraft mishap, Services must determine if there are any ME, medical officers, or mishap or criminalinvestigation officers that must be present with the team and if there are any other requirements for mark-ing and removal of remains. 98AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006Figure 52.  Damaged Building Interior with Remains. Typically the teams should plan to mark remains as they encounter them if they were not already markedor indicated by USAR personnel. Marking may be a problem due to the surface materials not allowing(driven) stakes or flags to be used. Sometimes even high visibility marking tape will not stick to somedamaged surfaces. When this happens, use marking tape and flagging streamers to wrap around nearbyobjects when possible. The metal flagstick of colored flags can also be wrapped around pipes and othernearby objects to indicate remains. Then attach the S&R tags to the wrapped tape, flagging, or flags. Figure 53.  Damaged Building Interior and Marking Methods. For building searches where remains have to be removed concurrently to allow progress in the confinedspace, S&R should include photographing and bagging all identifying personal effects. Marking floorplan sketches is important. Mark on an individual grid type drawing of the floor plan layout for eachroom or hallway. Use floor plan nomenclature on the S&R tags to specify the room or hallway location.Combine the individual drawings into a final combined mishap diagram. For buildings where an explosion may have widely scattered remains (horizontally and vertically), recov-ery team members should enter, mark, photograph, and remove the remains as encountered in each roomand hallway. Entry and search efforts may require you to pick your way around debris such as furnitureand fallen ceiling materials. If there are no major hindrances within the room, then recover remains in amanner that (1) allows you to more accurately measure and sketch the locations and (2) creates the leasthindrance in case you have to evacuate the building in a hurry. With these objectives in mind, proceed firstfrom the room’s doorway floor area outward toward the two side walls. Also remove any loose-remainshanging from the walls or ceiling. AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 200699For smaller rooms, move search efforts along in a search line parallel to the doorway wall while workingtoward the opposite wall. For larger rooms, you may have to set up grid search patterns. Try to alwaysclear the grid areas away from the doorway (or other entry point) in a manner that allows forunhindered exit in case of evacuation. When the floor area has been cleared, then remove fixed-remainson the walls, ceiling, and above floor fixtures and structures. Use ladders and support stands. Figure 54.  Create Individual Sketches for Each Room and Hallway. For collapsed buildings, mark, photograph, and then remove remains in each cleared area (1) asapproved by either the USAR structural technicians or structural engineers and (2) as allowed by investi-gators who may be conducting initial or concurrent evidence gathering. When debris removal is under-way, mark, photograph, and remove remains as they become exposed during heavy equipment efforts oras debris removal teams uncover the remains. The USAR technician, structural engineer, and fire depart-ment SAR personnel may be able to identify which floor level the remains were associated with at col-lapsed building sites, but this is often only tentative. Long-term investigations are usually required.There is no one safe way to search collapsed buildings. Recovery is normally a part of the evidentiary anddebris removal processes. In some cases, only USAR team members may be capable of retrievingremains, so determine with USAR team leaders how you need to work with them. Marking Stakes, Flags, and Tape. There can be variations in the physical marking methods (stakes,flags, tape) to fit the circumstances of the remains, terrain, and the type and number of remains. However,the marking designations should always be consistent. Outside marking method for intact or nearly intact remains. For marking intact remains or primarily intactremains, a stake is the preferred method. Drive a stake at those locations and mark it with an “R” (for sin-gle intact remains) or “R - #” (for multiple intact remains). Use consecutive numbers for each stake. Us a“P - #” for fragmented (i.e., partial) remains (example, P-1). If identity is confirmed or known, such as fora recognizable portion of primarily intact remains, show this on the tag attached to the stake, but still usea “P - #” designation on the stake (whether known or unknown). See Appendix E, S&R Tags, Marking,and Recording, for more detailed guidance. NOTE: Other personnel who have been or are on site may use other specific marking scheme colors and designations as a part of the ISB and SIB investigating procedures for marking specific mishap investigation evidence types (instruments, flight controls, ejection seats, human remains, crash related landmarks, etc).  Contact the on-scene commander and/or ISB or SIB Investigating Officer to coordinate or deconflict flag color usage.  100AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006Outside marking method for fragmented remains. For marking multiple fragmented remains in a small orenclosed area (such as a crater), high visibility flags can be more readily used with the continuingsequence “P - #” designation. If the remains field appears to have a central area, drive a stake there with acircled sequence number to allow for coordinating with follow on surveying and GPS plots. Figure 55.  Numbered Stake in the Middle of Remains Field (for GPS Purposes). Inside building marking method. For marking in a building room or hallway when tape will stick to it, use12-inch lengths of colored, high-visibility plastic (adhesive) tape. If additional visibility is needed to findthe marking, attach about 18 inches of similar colored flagging to hang under the tape (see Figure 56.). Ifthe tape will not stick to the surface material, wrap a piece of high visibility flagging, tape, or the wireflagstick around the closest object to help highlight the location for recovery. Figure 56.  Typical Building Room Marking for Nearby Remains. Mark on the tape with an indelible marker to show the “R - #” or “P - #” designation plus the floor androom number. You may have to assign a temporary room number if the room is not designated on the floorplan. Make sure to write that assigned room number on your copy of the actual floor plan you use. Example. The search finds the eighth set of partial remains in a building on the second floor in room 240. The remains would be designated as “F2 Rm240 P-8”. For hallways, use the hallway designation on the floor plan (or the letter you have to assign to it if notmarked on the floor plan –– mark the letter that you assigned on the floor plan). Example. The search finds the twelfth set of partial remains in a building on the fourth floor, in the central hallway (you mark it as “C” on the floor plan), nearest to room 412. The remains would be designated as “F4 HC Rm412 P-12”. AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006101Continue to use consecutive numbers if possible, but if several teams are working multiple floors or areas,assign them a block of R-and P-numbers that they can use without having to constantly check back andforth. The S&R team chief must ensure that team leaders compare their marked floor plans to reconcileany assigned floor and hallway designations (1) before leaving the location and (2) before CE EAs visitthe location (to create official diagrams). Correct any duplications or errors. You can vary the mark-ing method as needed for your situation, but always ensure that your marking method for each building isconsistent. Remains Recovery Procedures. The recovery team must act as a unit to tag and designate remains andportions of remains. Due to physical stresses, exposure, and mental stresses, which can be considerableover the period of S&R, some S&R team members may have to be replaced. Do not expect team membersto remember which remains were where, even if they were on the original search team. Use standardmarking-tagging procedures throughout the effort and document findings on the sketches and in datatables. The recovery team makeup varies by circumstances, but is normally eight members, a photographer pro-vided by the base multimedia support office, and a team leader. If remains recovery must be concurrentwith search, then a CE engineer assistant or an S&R team member may have to accompany the team toprovide on-the-spot surveying for shots of the location. For many mishaps, remains are dismembered andburned and there may not be 100% recovery. Team members must handle remains with the utmost care toensure against loss or destruction of valuable identification media or evidence. Figure 57.  Handle Remains with Care, Placing on Sheets as Needed Before Placing in the Human Remains Pouch. NOTES:No remains should be moved or disturbed without the consent of the ISB or SIB Medical Officer, ISB or SIB President, or the on-scene commander.  This should also be done in coordination with the servicing JAG when possible.The standard tagging procedures presented in this section are not the same as those that may have to be used for an expedient or contingency recovery.For outdoor recoveries, use survey-grade GPS to survey each intact or primarily intact remains. Also plotas many as possible “R” (remains), “P” (fragmented or partial remains), “E” (personal effects), and“S-type” (an item or equipment (on or about the remains) identified by an inspector or investigator) des-ignations. Also plot the circled number center stake of any remains fields. If only a handheld PLGR-typeGPS is available, use it as previously discussed to identify the primary longitude-latitude-altitude forappropriate key locations. 102AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006Table 11.  Primary Steps for Remains Recovery (non-expedient). Step Tagging Primary Remains Recovery Procedures 1. Use three tags for portion of remains found.  a. The P-number must be written on each tag and thestake or flag.   b. Attach one tag to the remains portion.   c. Attach the second tag to the remains small plasticbag.  This tag can be eliminated if the remains bagscan be marked on directly.  d. Temporarily  attach  the  third  (second)  tag  to  thestake or flag. 2. Use two tags for each whole remains found or partialremains which are too large to fit into a small bag andmust be included in a separate HRP. a. The  R-  or  P-number  must  be  written  on  each  tagand on the stake or flag.   b. Attach one tag to the remains or on the remains (iffirst wrapped in a sheet).   c. Attach the second tag to the human remains pouch.   Photography  1. Ensure that a color photograph is taken of each remainswith the tag’s R- or P-number showing.   2. The  same  applies  to  any  E-  or  S-numbered  orISB-tagged items whenever possible. 3. Photographs and videotapes should include a close-upshot  of  the  remains  and  an  image  that  depicts  theremains in relationship to the majority of the wreckageor the mishap scene. GPS Position  When a GPS reading is possible, CE should take readings at: 1. All major remains and remains field,  2. The  boundary  points  of  the  various  search  methodsused, and  3. At  major  identification  points  within  and  near  thesearch area. If CE is not available to take the readings and PLGR-type GPS is available, then Services should take a reading for the major identification points and identify these on the sketch.  AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006103Step Retrieve Remains Detailed Search Attach Third Tags Preserve and Transport Primary Remains Recovery Procedures 1. Carefully place the remains in an HRP or plastic bag. 2. Minimize handling to prevent undue damage.  1. The  ground  beneath  the  remains  should  be  carefullyexamined and immediate area to assure that all portionsare recovered.   If  it  is  suspected  that  there  are  remains  mixed  withsmall debris and soil, a sifting box operation should beestablished to recover all possible remains and personaleffects.   2.3. Videotape  the  primary  operation  to  show  the  basiceffort,  but  a  constant  video  is  not  required  unless  theinvestigating officer requires this. a.It may not be necessary to photograph each uniden-tifiable desiccated, burned, or chemically damagedpiece of small remains.   b. The  local  medical  examiner  or  medical  officershould make the determination.   For portions of remains that are in plastic bags and then placed in a HRP, securely attach the third tag marked with the P-numbers (once a photo has been taken of the remains) to the outside of the human remains pouch. 1.Ice  or  refrigerate  the  remains  as  soon  as  possible  toreduce degradation.  Refrigerate at a temperature of 38to  40  degrees  Fahrenheit  (3.3  to  4.4  degrees  Centi-grade).    If  refrigeration  is  not  readily  available,  packHRP and plastic bag remains in ice or ice packs in insu-lated chests or in a transfer case, depending on the sizeof the remains.  Transfer cases are normally only usedOCONUS,  but  for  larger  mishaps  with  commingledremains, transfer cases can be obtained when shipmentis required to Dover AFB. 2. Transport  the  remains  by  mortuary  personnel  to  thetemporary collection point or morgue. Personal Effects Recovery Procedures.  [The personal effects (PE) referred to here are those PE foundat the site of a mishap.] PE are marked using the “E-#” designation and annotated on the site map. PE areplaced in plastic bags secured with wire-tie shipping tags. Those PE found near the remains and identifiedas being of the remains (i.e., personal associated remains that an investigating officer determines arerelated) are placed in a plastic bag and then placed in the same HRP. There is no different marking con-vention for PE associated with remains or partial remains. Mark these types of PE with a tag using an104AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006“E-#” designation, but write the words “Associated with” and the tag number of the associated remains(i.e., the “R-#” or “P-#”) as designated by the investigating or medical officer. Example. The detached right leg in a portion of a flight suit (listed as portion P-8) has a flight cap par-tially hanging across the right lower leg pocket. While moving wreckage, the cap appears to fall from the pocket. There are currently nine marked personal effects. If an ISB or SIB investigating officer deems that the portion of remains and the cap are related, then mark the flight cap as associated. Mark the flight cap with “E-10 Associated with P-8”. PE or other personal belongings found loose at the site will be marked and annotated on the site map andplaced in plastic bags secured with wire tie shipping tags. Place all loose PE into a separate HRP. Do notattempt to re-associate personal property or accouterments found loose at the mishap site until the remainsare processed and identified by a medical examiner. Always ask the investigating officer when in doubt.When conducting a contingency S&R without an investigating officer, always treat and label the item asan unassociated personal effect. The items must be safeguarded and delivered to the identification pro-cessing facility. Services personnel are responsible for loose personal effects and will inventory the PEand annotate them on a DD Form 1076, Military Operations Record of Personal Effects of DeceasedPersonnel. PE may be retained as evidence by civil and military law enforcement or federal investigativeauthorities until no longer needed. Continuing Remains Recovery. Remains may be found throughout an investigation or by circumstanceafter the investigation. Some locations (such as mountainsides) may experience movement that uncoversadditional remains. Weather conditions may affect remains exposure (i.e., remains can be uncovered byaction of running water or revealed under melting snow). Normally the most frequent reason to recoveradditional remains is the movement of mishap wreckage as a part of the final investigation or as a part ofthe site cleanup. Figure 58.  Some Remains Recovery May Require Extensive Efforts. Depending on the location and jurisdiction, Services S&R personnel should either retain a number of per-sonnel on scene throughout the investigation and until aircraft recovery, or place personnel on standby tobe called as required. The normal practice is to leave a team leader and at least five S&R team membersat the scene to be present during salvage operations should there be subsequent recovery. When recovery is complete and S&R terminated by the on-scene commander, notify HQ AFSVA/SVOMand the MAJCOM by telephone. The mortuary officer (MO) should not request disposition instructionsprior to termination of aircraft salvage operations without the approval of HQ AFSVA/SVOM. If there isa subsequent recovery of fragmented remains, the MO should contact HQ AFSVA/SVOM and contact theperson authorized to direct disposition of the remains. Subsequently recovered remains could be markedAFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006105with the in sequence P-number designation only if the MAJCOM Services mortuary office or AFSVA/SVOM instructs the team to do so. Otherwise use new P- or E-numbers, the date, location, and recoveringteam base designation. Write information on the tag that the site may be related to a previous mishap ifWing Safety identifies the site as a known previous mishap site. If the remains were found after anextended period of time after the mishap, contact AFSVA/SVOM to determine if remains recovered bythe Air Force (or a jurisdictional authority) should be sent to the OAFME for identification. Identification Process.  For aircraft mishaps, the ISB/SIB Medical Officer assists with the identificationprocess, which is made by the medical examiner (ME) with jurisdictional authority and with OAFMEwhen secondary jurisdiction is necessary. For recognizable remains, remains can be identified based on astatement of identification. However, presumptive identification from circumstantial evidence should notbe used. For remains identified based on a statement of recognition of the deceased, an Air Force mortu-ary specialist should still complete a review of the case prior to final disposition of the remains. For not recognizable remains, identification must be made by scientific means to establish a positive ID.Identification is made at the jurisdictional level, either by the local ME with or without assistance fromHQ AFSVA/SVOM, the base medical facility with the medical officer assisted as necessary, or throughOAFME or Dover AFB mortuary center. The medical examiner releases the remains to a mortuary or themortuary officer for processing following completion of all medical actions, including ISB/SIB medicalactions for aircraft mishaps. Remains transfer from the initial mishap investigation may be by vehicles owned by the jurisdictionalauthority to their serving mortuary facility, by base hospital medical transportation, or by an appropriate,adequate vehicle designated to transport the remains. Adequacy depends on the location and time to trans-port. AFI 34-242 applies for CONUS and OCONUS transportation of remains. Critical Incident Stress Management (CISM) Recognition and Debriefing. When an SIB is on scene,the medical officer normally assigns a trained peer stress debriefer to be on site for daily support, ifrequired. The medical officer may assign a peer stress debriefer to be on site to cover the primary aspectsof S&R. Determine with the on-scene medical officer if a peer stress debriefer will be available. If not, theS&R team chief, OIC, NCOIC, and team leaders need to be more aware of the daily aspects of stress andlook for signs of problems with participating members (see Table 12.). 106AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006Table 12.  Daily Concerns for Critical Incident Stress Management. (extracted from PEP guidance in AFI 44-153) Area of Stress Management About Stress Primary Guidance for Signs of Stress 1. Stress is inherent to survival. 2. Stress is necessary for human development and growth. 3. Stress is initially positive in generating action, but toomuch is unhealthy. Dealing with Stress Positive Stress Behaviors 4. Stress can affect physical health. 5. Stress is additive and a combination of stressful experi-ences can have as much effect as one traumatic stress-ful event. 6. Stress is manageable. 1. Everyone has stress reactions. 2. Reactions are NORMAL reactions to abnormal situa-tions. 3. Reactions must be dealt with to avoid performance dis-ruption and the development of physical and psycho-logical illnesses. If you don’t deal with stress, it will deal with you. In  many  cases,  there  are  effective,  simple  means  fordealing with stress. 4.5.1. Know and stay in touch with your purpose. 2. Be a team player and think US instead of ME. 3. Develop a sense of confidence about your group’s abil-ity to accomplish your mission. 4. Practice  your  spiritual  beliefs  and  utilize  them  assource of support. 5. Have a buddy. 6. Accurately identify what you can and cannot control. AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006107Signs of Ineffective Coping Insufficient sleep. 1.Insufficient nourishment. 2.Insufficient fluid intake, alcohol, and other drug abuse. 3.4. Breakdown  of  respect  for  those  in  the  chain  of  com-mand. 5. Breakdown of respect for lawful orders and directives. 6. Breakdown of communication within the chain of com-mand. 7. Not  taking  care  of  yourself  (i.e.,  getting  too  thirsty,tired, or hungry). Some precepts of pre-exposure preparation (PEP) guidance should be considered throughout S&R. Placeemphasis on the following (AFI 44-153) guidance for all members: “It is ultimately your responsibility to deal with your feelings of stress by knowing and using the methods most effective for you, but your ability to effectively deal with stress [is] greatly enhanced by letting others be a part of your efforts.” All personnel who were a part of the S&R operation, including any personnel from another unit thatdirectly assisted Services with S&R (i.e., on-site photographer and surveyors) must undergo structuredcritical incident stress (CIS) support. A CIS defusing is a more informal method conducted as soon aspossible (such as on the bus trip back if possible when an S&R group is being transported together), but atleast within 8 to 12 hours from return from S&R. A CIS debriefing is a more formal session to be heldwithin 24 to 72 hours of return from S&R. Both are conducted by or for the medical group by a trainedcritical incident stress manager. This can be somewhat problematic in keeping track of scheduling every-one if an S&R contingent remains on site to support continuing recovery. Do not delay CIS debriefinguntil all personnel return if this will delay the training for most personnel beyond 72 hours. Check withyour medical officer for a decision on scheduling team personnel for CIS defusing and debriefing ses-sions. Redeploy the Team to Home Station. When S&R has been terminated by the on-scene commander orhead of the investigating board, then the team must demobilize and recover field equipment that has beenused on site. Recovery of equipment and transportation back to station should be according to standardprocedures within wing plans or operating instructions. If exposed to bloodborne pathogens or other haz-ardous materials, some exposed materials may have to be treated as a hazardous material for transportback to station. Meet with representatives from the medical group (bioenvironmental engineer), readinesslogistics (transportation), civil engineers (environmental and readiness technicians), and contracting (ifnecessary) to arrange for encapsulating barrier materials or overpack barrels (see Figure 59.) to containcontaminated tent materials, refrigeration units, clothing, or field equipment that must be taken back tothe base and decontaminated or disposed of (as necessary). 108AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006NOTE: Be aware that if the site itself must be cleaned up due to hazardous wastes and debris, the clean-up contractor or military personnel may uncover additional small fragmented remains within the several months that it takes to organize and conduct the cleanup.  Recovery of a few highly fragmented remains may not be a critical incident to more seasoned members, but consider some form of CISM PEP and follow-up with the recovery team members. Figure 59.  Services May Require Overpack Barrels for Any Contaminated Clothing and Equipment. To avoid any chances of contaminating people and transportation, always try to ensure that returning teammembers have an opportunity to clean up and change into clean clothes or coveralls for the return trip tothe base. If this is not possible, at least provide for wet towelettes and other materials to help them cleanup. Team members may still have to wear surgical masks and barrier gloves to avoid contact during thetrip if unable to clean up and change. Try to provide stress relief and some refreshments on the way backto the base, especially if members will be traveling for a while from a remote site. If there is unit transpor-tation for all team members, then try to schedule a defusing session or have a medical officer peer stressdebriefer on board to observe members.  AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006109 One of the most important areas of concern during search and recovery (S&R) efforts is to make sure thatall responsible parties are informed. When within exclusive federal jurisdiction, it is easier for the Ser-vices mortuary officer to work mortuary affairs issues within the overall military system of notificationand support. It is a Services mortuary affairs responsibility to keep the person authorized to direct dispo-sition (PADD) informed of their entitlements and to provide necessary mortician assistance. AFSVA/SVOM is responsible for informing the PADD for OCONUS deaths when the PADD is in CONUS. When other jurisdictions have authority, then there is sometimes a loss of control due to other partiesreleasing information that has not yet been received by military authorities. Always work with your basepublic affairs and medical officers to make certain they are working with local media and medical exam-iners to ensure that information being released is factual and that the next of kin are not confused. Servicesis not the first point of contact for informing the next of kin on the results of S&R. Services is required toconduct S&R and keep the base and command authorities advised of status so they can make official noti-fications. Services should always work with the base and command authorities to ensure that S&R information ispresented in an efficient, consistent manner and that information is accurate and not speculation. How-ever, during a loss of life mishap or mishap, it is up to the proper base authorities to notify the next of kinof the status of their loved ones. Again, AFSVA/SVOM is responsible for informing the PADD for OCO-NUS deaths when the PADD is in CONUS. Mortuary affairs should not make contact with PADD untilproper casualty affairs notification has been made. Until then, it is better to make preliminary contact withthe deceased’s unit and provide the unit with the expected mortuary affairs contact information. Before taking any actions with the next of kin or PADD, the mortuary officer should actually obtain infor-mation listed in the deceased member’s records to determine the recorded PADD for remains and personalproperty. The recorded PADD may not be the same person or the apparent next of kin. The unit can helpemphasize that all of the military mortuary affairs efforts will be of the highest priority and that the mili-tary will take action when needed, even if a local jurisdiction is in charge of the initial efforts and themedia may be looking for a story. After official notification, it becomes a mortuary affairs effort and thePADD is provided information. If there are conflicts, immediately contact the JAG. Person Authorized to Direct Disposition (PADD).  The PADD is determined from the member’s record.If there is a question on who the PADD should be, there is an order of precedence established in AFI34-242. For conflicts or disputes, the determination of the PADD must be legally adjudicated. Once theyare known, it is important to keep the PADD informed of S&R efforts. However, S&R efforts do notalways equate to identification (ID) of the remains and the need to begin processing for entitlements. ThePADD needs to know this. AFI 34-242 relates that Air Force policy is to individually segregate and iden-tify the remains of deceased personnel to the fullest extent possible and to use all available means and sci-entific resources to accomplish this. This is especially important when multiple casualties are involved.No information concerning ID is to be released until final conclusions are established on all remains. Ifthe remains are recognizable, presumptive ID can be made. However, if remains are not recognizable, sci-entific means must be used to establish a positive ID. If local ID support is not available, the mortuaryofficer should contact HQ AFSVA/SVOM for ID assistance. A PADD briefing guide is available on the110AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006Services Mortuary Affairs website. Remains are not to be classified as unidentifiable or unknown until anAir Force mortuary specialist has reviewed the case and processed the remains. Remember: “The mortuary officer will not brief the PADD on mortuary entitlements until the remainshave been positively identified. In the interim, the PADD should be kept informed daily on the status ofidentification.” [Excerpt from AFI 34-242, paragraph 7.3] Chain of Command and Notifications. You need to have an operating plan and checklist to use upon ini-tial notification of a death and when S&R will be required. Services should have an official command orbase plan (or both) and checklist to address initial notification to your theater or supporting MAJCOMservices mortuary office. The Services Mortuary Affairs website has numbers and methods of communi-cations for outside your MAJCOM. Although not a frequent occurrence, notification procedures shouldbe taught to and well understood by alternate mortuary officers and staff. When S&R efforts are initiated,the primary mortuary officer has little time to initiate and send updates while working the various aspectsof the initial site visit and S&R preparations. The primary methods and points of contact are listed in AFI 34-242, including information required forinitial death reports and supplemental reports. Sample formats are available in the publication. Dependingon the type of mishap, notification would include the MAJCOM Services offices, AFSVA/SVOM, andAF/ILV. For overseas deployment situations, the deployed base’s Services Control Center will include the day’smortuary affairs status in the daily SITREP. For AEF deployments where Air Force personnel are on anAEF base or joint operating base, obtain notification details through the theater Services mortuary officefor Air Force and other branches of the armed forces, as well as authorized civilians and civilian contrac-tors. Follow-Up Actions. Of prime importance as a follow-up action is to ensure that all S&R participantsreceive follow-on CIS debriefings. The following is not a prioritized list, and some actions may be com-pleted by the mortuary officer, NCO, or technicians. 111AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006Table 13.  Follow-up Actions List. #  Action Coordinate actions related to disposition of the remains, mortuary entitlements, military honors, and Summary Court Officer. Maintain a mortuary case file for the deaths of all eligible personnel. Maintain a written record of all communications with the PADD. Complete any final message notifications to close out S&R. Document findings and conclusions (unless accomplished by AFSVA/SVOM) on AF Form 697, Identification Findings and Conclusions, and forward to the commander for signature. Close out the S&R log of events. Coordinate with CE for a final copy of the site diagram to include in your case records. Complete an after action report (see Section 7, After Action Reports and Lessons Learned) and forward copies per applicable AF, MAJCOM, and theater requirements. Institute changes and training based on lessons learned. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  112AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006Contingency Location S&R. In a contingency environment, basic S&R procedures should be used, butmodified for the theater and situation. S&R, tentative (Believed to Be (BTB)) identification, temporaryrefrigerated storage or interment-disinterment, and evacuation of remains must meet theater requirements.Services S&R is based on a designated 26-person team with an S&R OIC and NCOIC and 10 core-trainedServices personnel. Equipment and manning are per UTCs, with augmentees provided by other units,including other services for some joint service operations. [Theater components may only require a single13-person team.] AFI 34-242 provides much more definitive guidance to wing commanders regardingsupport for S&R teams. All augmentee members must also be trained and provided CISM preparation.Mortuary support is typically at the level of a mortuary collection point operation. AEF or joint service beddown bases with Air Force or primarily Air Force base operating support respon-sibility may conduct S&R in support of mishaps or incidents near their installation. For a fatal mishap orincident, the mortuary officer must contact the Component Headquarters Services staff to determineresponsibility for S&R. The Component Headquarters staff coordinates with the mortuary affairs leadService to make this determination. When the beddown location will conduct S&R operations, Servicesmanages them using core and tasked members. Wing Operational Instructions should be developed toidentify the tasking requirements and the levels of training and protection. If the location is too small tohave a full 26-person team and more personnel are required, contact the theater Services mortuary repre-sentative to obtain assistance from other units. S&R may only be conducted under conditions that do not endanger the S&R team. Sometimes localauthorities near the base, country and embassy officials, and groups like the Red Cross/Red Crescent havegood contacts in the immediate mishap area. They can lend assistance when contacting or dealing withlocal inhabitants who may also have been affected by the mishap. Under joint operations, local authoritiesand (non-hostile) military personnel may arrive on the scene and be ostensibly in charge for initial searchand rescue efforts. Work with military liaison personnel in country to help in assuming control for S&Roperations. Under non-hostile conditions, EOD, CBRN requirements, and Security Forces determine if/when the area is safe to conduct S&R operations. Use standard search and tagging and bagging proce-dures. Under hostile conditions, installation commanders must determine when it is safe to conduct S&Roperations. Expedient grab and bag procedures may have to be used. The mortuary officer coordinates with bioenvironmental engineering personnel, who will determine whatpersonal protective equipment (PPE) are required at the mishap site. When expedient S&R is required anda pre-site visit in not possible, a Bioenvironmental Engineer may have to rely on information from anyemergency responders or unit members with on-site information to help determine the use of PPE. The mortuary officer coordinates with Civil Engineers (CE) to determine if survey-grade GPS capabilityexists to plot remains and personal effects locations. Sketch the site and have CE finalize site diagrams. Use the search method that applies best to your location and the time available for searching. Normallyonly a standard area sweep, a lane search method with a trailing team, and a small grid search are consid-ered. Heat stress, work and rest cycles, lifting requirements, sanitation, and bloodborne pathogens mustall be considered as limiting factors when conducting S&R. AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006113Units conducting recovery operations OCONUS in a remote location must still take special precautions topreserve all items that might be useful in establishing a tentative identification of remains. When perform-ing recovery operations, use any means available to cover and contain all remains and portions of remainsrecovered. The policy is to not remove personal property and effects from the remains at the mishap site(i.e., official cards (line badge) and papers, nametags, and accouterments). Only weapons and/or ordnancemay be removed from the remains and this should be by Security Forces or EOD personnel. If normal recovery can be used, then use the tagging and bagging process. This uses the previously iden-tified methods for using stakes and flags marked with consecutive R- (while intact they may be unrecog-nizable) or P-numbers for fragmented-partial unknown remains. When possible, also mark all personaleffects (PE) with consecutive E-numbers. If survey-grade GPS is available, the location of each intact andportion of remains and PE should be plotted. These GPS coordinates will be annotated on both remainsand PE tags. If only a non-survey, non-mapping GPS is available and time is short, take as accurate a read-ing as possible on the most prominent feature at the mishap site and then hand draw maps or sketches (inrelation to that feature) so that the information can be used later to plot the location of remains and per-sonal effects. If sifting operations are required, the sifting boxes and any support stands should be made asportable as possible. Smaller sifting boxes with removable handles work well with folding sawhorses (seeFigure 60.). Figure 60.  Sifting Boxes May Be Required Even for Some Contingency Losses. Use two tags for each remains (intact or portion) and PE. If survey-grade GPS readings are available, theGPS coordinate must be written on both tags. If only a site feature GPS reading can be taken, then the R-,P-, and E-number should be written on both tags. Attach one tag to the remains or each portion of remainsor PE, and the other tag(s) to the human remains pouch (HRP) containing the remains, multiple associatedremains, or multiple PE bag(s). If a beddown location photographer or a combat camera photographer is not available to take photos, andthere is no investigating officer or other on-scene commander to take photos, then bring a digital camerato take photos of the primary mishap site, perspective shots of the site and primary remains (intact or pri-marily intact), and as many fragmented remains and PE as possible that are tagged. Fragmented remainsshould be placed in plastic bags and then into an HRP. Minimize handling to prevent damage. 114AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006Examine the ground beneath the remains and immediate area to assure that all observable remains arerecovered. Based on the number of souls involved, if analysis of the remains indicates that other remainsare still unaccounted for, and if you have the time and equipment to continue S&R, expand the search orcheck for buried remain fragments in a crater (such as with a sifting box), scattered in the area, or underwreckage. The site may have to be marked (usually by an identifying GPS coordinate for the site ratherthan a permanent marker). Later S&R efforts would be made to recover the unrecovered remains. Theproblem with not completing all S&R efforts in a contingency environment is the problem of animal scav-enging, human pilfering, or enemy intelligence gathering. PE associated with the remains are placed in plastic bags and then placed in the same HRP as the remains.All other PE are placed into plastic bags and then placed into a separate HRP. PE found loose at the siteshould be annotated on the site map and the PE placed in plastic bags secured with wire tie shipping tags.Do not attempt to re-associate personal property or accouterments found loose at the mishap site until theremains are processed and identified. Follow standard refrigeration or icing procedures for transport and storage. Transfer cases are used OCO-NUS and can be packed with ice for transport, but do not place ice directly on remains. Expedient S&R Situations.  Due to hostilities, this may require a grab and bag process. A small team ofcore Services personnel, Security Forces, EOD, and an investigating officer(s) and medical person (if pos-sible) are normally inserted into the site in armored vehicles or helicopters. Expedient S&R teams wouldhave a predetermined kit of PPE that is suitable for their geographic area. Based on the number of souls involved, the response kit would contain enough HRPs (example: doublethe number of souls when possible) and plastic bags to recover all primary observable remains that can besafely obtained within the mission on-ground times. If remains have become contaminated by hazardoussubstances, at least two HRPs should be used to contain the set of remains during transport back from themishap location. If there are limitations in transport, a single HRP may have to contain a larger number ofbagged fragmented remains than would be used with normal procedures. PE found on or associated with the remains are placed in plastic bags and then placed in the same HRP asthe remains. When possible, wrap the intact or primary remains together in a sheet and place in the HRPbefore placing in bags for smaller remains and PE. All other PE are placed into plastic bags and these areplaced into a separate HRP. If a photographer cannot accompany the team, bring a camera whenever possible and have someone pho-tograph the location. Also, have someone take a GPS reading for the site, especially if a GPS position ormap location cannot be determined by the helicopter pilot or vehicle operator. Have the pilot or vehicleoperators note any reference points that may help when returning to the location for follow-on S&R. Pho-tograph the major mishap items and the remains (intact and primarily intact) in perspective to the majormishap items. If flying into the location, try and take an aerial shot of the location during approach. NOTE: In a contingency environment, determine if a low light flash can be safely used.  If not, use a film camera with low light film or a digital camera where you can use a longer exposure setting.  Longer exposure fast speed-low light film and digital cameras can often be processed to enhance lighting details. Support for Non-Services Units Conducting S&R. Units that must recover the remains of their ownmembers may request guidance and assistance with supplies if they have to recover the remains due toAFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006115operations in a high threat area, mission security, or necessity. When this is a possibility for contingencybeddown bases, try to have a few handout kits available for release. Each single-person kit could include several pairs of surgical gloves, two surgical masks, five or six largeplastic baggies, a sheet (use a subdue color if a white sheet would be too visible during a contingency sit-uation), and a half dozen blank tags wrapped up inside a rolled up HRP. A separate HRP may also be pro-vided. This would either be tied together or sealed for easier transport in a backpack. If possible, providethem with a paper copy of this handbook’s Section 6 and Appendix F and highlight those portions thatthey should follow for an expedient S&R operation. Advise them that PE found on or associated with theremains should be placed in plastic bags and then placed in the HRP with the remains. Tell them that whenpossible, they should wrap the intact or primary remains together in a sheet and place this in the HRPbefore placing the plastic bags for smaller remains or PE. They should be told to place all other PE intoplastic bags and then place these into a separate HRP. Special (classified mission) units and other field operating units should recover the remains and bringthem back for processing following either their necessary classified procedures or the standard proceduresfor a beddown base location casualty collection point and mortuary collection point (MCP). Remainsreceive medical confirmations and mortuary affairs processing and return stateside to the Dover AFBmortuary center. If not a classified mission, have the unit write down on the tags any identifying informa-tion on the deceased, the unit, the date, and location. If they took a GPS reading at the site, include thatinformation on shipping tags and in the daily mortuary report. If a map location was available with anyidentifying local features, provide these on the tag or include a copy of the marked map in a sealed bagalong with the tag. NOTE: Ensure that remains being returned from hostile actions (to your MCP for processing and return stateside) have been or are checked if necessary for contamination and possible unexploded ordnance (UXO) before processing and placing in transfer cases.   116 AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006The When and Where of Providing Inputs. The mortuary officer will submit an after action report toHQ AFSVA/SVOM through their MAJCOM. The report will include the location of the incident, the startdate and end date of S&R operations, the number of fatalities, lessons learned and limiting factors. Thereport must be submitted NLT 30 days after recovery operations have been completed. Additional infor-mation can be extremely useful for analysis and determining of resources and training. When possible,also forward a copy of the log of events, which should identify the PPE and other special equipment, vehi-cles, and assistance that were used. Follow-on Update Actions. It is vitally important that each S&R effort be used as an opportunity toimprove efforts. There are always lessons learned, even if there is no formal requirement to submit alengthy lessons learned report outside of the after action report. Findings should be discussed and baseand Services organization plans, emergency response plans, and operating instructions (OIs) should all beupdated to correct any shortcomings in (1) response procedures, (2) notification efforts, (3) S&R tactics,techniques, and procedures, (4) training, (5) personnel, (6) transportation, (7) supplies, and (8) equipment.Even if new resources are not obtained and physically on hand, pre-identifying sources for emergencyprocurement or leasing is usually acceptable and can eliminate having to maintain a large quantity of sup-plies that are perishable. Updating plans and availability of resources and documenting this information isespecially important when deployed and AEF rotations can create a lack of continuity. Always includeimportant efforts in a continuity folder and up-to-date OIs.  AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006117 The following three pages identify suggested information for a log of events that can be used by Servicessearch and recovery (S&R) teams to document S&R actions. The first page is for the initial contact andthe next two pages are used by team chiefs. A running log of events is maintained by a recorder at the location for all mishaps. It is attached to the firstthree pages and may be copied for use in an after action report. Each entry on the running log should include the date, time, actions that occur, actions or support that isrequested, and the person who requested the action. For OCONUS deployments, the format for the log ofevents can be similar or the same as the Services Control Center’s (SCC) log of events, but should be keptas a separate portion of that log if maintained by the SCC. Provide other information such as weather conditions, time personnel/teams arrive or leave the site, dailyteam status, requests for other support or when support arrives, all CISM and safety briefings, and allactions taken to handle shortfalls or limiting factors. Reproducible copies of the three pages are available on the Services Mortuary Affairs website. 118AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006Completed by the Services Commander or other assigned position functioning as the Mortuary Officer-S&R Team Chief during the time of the mishap. AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006119Filled out by the Gold team’s Team Chief or a designated person-recorder.  120AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006Filled out by the Silver team’s Team Chief or a designated person-recorder. AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006121To safely conduct a search and recovery (S&R) operation, the Mortuary Officer-S&R Team Chief deter-mines with the Bioenvironmental Engineer what personal protective equipment (PPE) is required at themishap site. For normal aircraft mishaps, the Bioenvironmental Engineer will select PPE items based onfact finding from many sources, including the fire department, wing safety, aircraft maintenance, flyingoperations, local responding authorities, environmental engineers for the jurisdiction, and the primarypoint of contact subject matter experts. For responses to expedient S&R or where there are mass fatalities over a large area, such as during home-land security responses in support of National Response Plan supported efforts (such as declared disastersor terrorist attacks), a bioenvironmental engineer may not be on the immediate scene in your area. There-fore, you need to understand that determining the hazards is a multi-step process. 1. First responders control the mishap scene and conduct search and rescue (SAR). First respondersuse action plans and material safety data sheets (MSDS) in the initial response. 2. When there are fatalities, S&R efforts are required as a follow-on action at the scene. Hazards forclose  contact  support  must  be  evaluated  by  obtaining  information  from  initial  responders  andother knowledgeable sources of information (such as those mentioned above). 3. Follow on investigations or continuing recovery efforts may reveal additional on-scene hazardsand require additional S&R efforts and reevaluation of PPE. Appendix B-1 presents background information on safety mishap classifications. Appendix B-2 is suggested information for initial review of on-site hazards at a mishap scene. For mishap locations that are wetlands, swamps, or water bodies, determine if special dive teams will berequired. For mishap locations that have mountains and steep slopes, determine early whether the degree of sloperequires assistance or special teams to recover remains. Mountains with steeper slopes that require assis-tance may be traversable by military personnel with training. When the region is unknown, local climbingclubs may be able to provide the Yosemite Decimal Rating (YDR) for the location and help determinewhat PPE and climbing gear may be required. In North America, the YDR is generally stated as: Class 1: Hiking. Class 2: Simple scrambling, with possible occasional use of the hands. Class 3: Scrambling, a rope can be carried, but is usually not required. Class 4: Simple climbing, with exposure. A rope is often used. Natural protection can be easily found. Falls may well be fatal. Class 5: Technical free climbing. Climbing involves rope, belaying, and other protection hardware for safety. 122AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 20065.0 – 5.4:  A physically fit climber can actually climb at this level with little or no rock climbing skills, using only natural ability. 5.4 – 5.7: Requires use of rock climbing techniques such as hand jamming and or strength. 5.7 – 5.9: Rock climbing shoes, good skills, and some strength are usually necessary at this level. 5.9 to 5.14: Beyond 5.9, requiring excellent skills and strength, this level requires training for climbing techniques and commitment of time to maintain that level. Anything with a Class 4 or higher rating may require assistance, equipment, and use of slope techniques.Inclement weather, ice, and snow may prevent normal approach and require special assistance and trans-portation. AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006123There are five classes of Air Force mishaps: A, B, C, D, and E. A Class A fatal mishap would require aServices search and recovery (S&R) response. A Class A mishap results in one or more of the following: 1. Direct mishap cost totaling $1,000,000 or more. 2. A fatality or permanent total disability. 3. Destruction of a Department of Defense (DoD) aircraft (except Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV)unless above apply). Services S&R team chiefs should be familiar with the category of fatal mishaps to help determine whowill be the primary subject matter expert points of contact (POC) for determining hazards at the S&Rlocation when a bioenvironmental engineer representative may not be immediately present. Emergencyaction plans should have already been established on base for response to these categories, and the plansshould identify the primary POC for the initial responders. The Command Post and Fire Department Con-trol Center normally have this contact information. Contact Wing Safety, the Command Post, and the FireDepartment to help determine POCs for hazard evaluation. These are the primary categories and subcategories of Air Force mishaps. Nuclear: Nuclear Weapon, Reactor, and Radiological. Space: Pre-Launch, Launch, and Orbit. Aviation: Aircraft Flight, Aircraft Flight-Related, Aircraft Ground Operations, and UAV. Guided Missile Explosives and Chemical Agents Directed Energy: Directed Energy Weapon and Directed Energy Device. Afloat: On board or related to a DoD vessel and DoD diving or swimmer operations. Motor Vehicle: Government Motor Vehicle (GMV), Government Vehicle Other (GVO), and PrivateMotor Vehicle (PMV). Off-Duty Military: Sports and Recreation and Miscellaneous. Ground and Industrial: Fire, Combat Training, Physical and Athletic Conditioning, Contractor, NaturalPhenomena, Industrial Space, Industrial Aviation, Industrial Weapons, Industrial, and Miscellaneous. AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006124 AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006125 The following information was developed from an analysis of hazards at an F-117 crash, Air Force studies on composite materials, and the federal Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) technical report on composite materials.  S&R team members must have a PPE pre-briefing regarding the three areas of personal protection ––breathing, eyes, and skin (body, hands, feet), as well as weather-related work practice controls and protec-tion efforts. The Bioenvironmental Engineer provides this in conjunction with any EOD, fire department,or other technical expert inputs. These type briefings and operational practice reviews are especiallyimportant when composite materials are involved at a mishap where S&R efforts are required. When operating in a contingency environment, especially when joint service weapon systems and vehi-cles are involved, fully developed situational and PPE pre-briefings may not be possible. The followingare circumstances where a bioenvironmental engineer representative may not be present on-scene to pro-vide immediate direction or a pre-briefing and PPE selection. 1. Expedient S&R in a combat area, 2. Forward or other unit conducted S&R in a combat area, or 3. S&R in support of homeland security related responses. In these cases, S&R team members must be aware of composite material hazards, safety related practices,and common guideline considerations for PPE. They may have to rely on the inputs of other competentauthorities to safely continue operations. Fire department crash and rescue personnel have information on which aircraft, vehicles, and otherweapon systems have composite materials that require special actions during mishap responses. For civil-ian related disasters or terrorist responses, search and rescue (SAR) personnel will have been in the areabefore you enter for S&R and will have noted the hazards and losses. During the course of S&R efforts if you encounter suspected composite materials and the circumstancesare not as expected or covered in a pre-response PPE determination (by a bioenvironmental engineer or126AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006other responsible medical, fire, or safety personnel with jurisdiction at the scene), then leave the area.Next, determine as best a possible by contacting an appropriate authority if your PPE are still adequateand whether your safety and operating procedures should be changed. Composite Material Hazard Categories. These are the broad hazard categories that must be consideredat mishaps involving composite materials. 1. Organic Compound/Matrix Hazards (resins, adhesives, residual solvents, organic fibers) 2. Smoke and Fume Hazards 3. Reinforcement Hazards 4. Specific Carbon Fiber Hazards 5. Electrical Hazards to Equipment 6. Hazards to the Environment Definitive Guidance.  There is no definitive guidance for encountering these materials that will cover allcircumstances. Each mishap or event involving composite materials must be looked at individually. Ageneral rule is that unprotected personnel should avoid being downwind of areas with suspected compos-ite materials, especially when fire is involved. Composite Fiber Safety Awareness.  The following information regards composites. 1. Carbon fibers do not generally burn in fires, but this is dependent on the type of fibers. a.Impact damage (such as at a crash or a structural collapse) normally cracks the fibers andreleases small particles and dust. b. As the fibers heat up, they may oxidize and lose weight, in effect they become smaller parti-cles and increase the chances of being inhaled. c. The particles are very light and the heat generated by the fire can make them become airborne. 2. Graphite fibers are electrically conductive and the dust or fiber particles can cause shorts or otherproblems with electrical equipment. 3. Fibers which are still encased in resin are extremely stiff and sharp. It is very easy to get a graph-ite splinter by handling or contacting damaged composites. In case of expedient recovery or where common response kit items must be procured and stocked wellahead of time, you must have foreknowledge of the on-scene practices and equipment. Consider the rulesof thumb used by emergency first responders (see Table C). Then work with your bioenvironmental engi-neers to develop a specific response kit that includes their latest data on PPE and working near compositematerials. AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006127Table C. Safety PPE for Emergency Responders. Situation Burning/Smoldering Composites (primarily fire department and qualified HAZMAT workers) Broken or Splintered Composite Material (responders) Minimal Composite Exposure (responders) Requirement 1. SCBA 2. Aluminized Proximity Suits 3. Aluminized/puncture resistant gloves 4. No rubber gloves 1. Full -face respirator with dual car-tridge (HEPA & organic) filters. 2. Coated and hooded Tyvek® suit with optional booties (taped seams). 3. Leather work gloves (external). 4. Nitrile gloves (internal). 5. Hard-soled, leather work boots 1. BDUs with sleeves worn down. 2. Non-disposable and disposable HEPA respirators. 3. Safety glasses with side shields. 4. Leather work gloves (external wear). 5. Nitrile gloves (internal wear). 6. Hard-soled work boots. Adopt expedient recovery guidelines for operations on site when pre-site investigations may not be possi-ble. Based on previous AF weapon system study guidance also adopted by the Army for their weapon sys-tems, the following guidelines should be considered for contingency field use. 1. When personnel are within 25 feet of any burned composite materials or personnel may havebreak or cut either burned or unburned composite parts: a. Fitted full face respirators or fitted respirators and safety goggles are required. b. Safety goggles must be worn tight and have either no or small vent holes to minimize particu-late/fiber entry. c. Skin protection is required for the exposed areas of the body, hands, and feet. d. Coveralls should be as pre-selected by the bioenvironmental engineer given similar circum-stances. Wear external booties to eliminate possible boot contamination and reduce dermal128AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006contact potential. Seal any openings or attachment points, especially at the ankles and wrists,with duct-tape to keep out particulates. e. Gloves: should be puncture resistant leather gloves as a minimum with pre-approved hazardgloves worn as an insert to protect against bloodborne pathogens, solvent residue, and fuelspills. Caution: Do not wear Nitrile rubber gloves when handling burning or smokingcomposite materials. f. Boots: Steel-toed shoes and boots should be worn. g. Additional protection (i.e. SCBA, splash suits) as determined by the bioenvironmental engi-neer, fire department, safety, and maintenance personnel with appropriate weapon or back-ground specific training, will be worn when jet fuel/hydraulic fluid or other hazards exist. 2. Recommended PPE for personnel working in peripheral areas.  The on-scene commander shallestablish the limits as appropriate with the advice of appropriate primary emergency responders,emergency managers, subject matter experts, and safety and medical personnel. [As a guide, theperipheral area should be defined as more than 25 feet away from damaged composite parts. Thisdistance may vary depending upon environmental conditions (i.e. rain, dry, high winds, remotesite, etc.), which might help or hinder the situation.] a. A disposable or non-disposable fitted respirator. b. Safety glasses with side shields. c. BDUs with sleeves worn down and tightened. d. Hard soled shoes. e.If any debris is to be manipulated, the previously discussed glove ensemble is also required. If you encounter or believe that special conditions exist that would increase the hazard, obtain increasedprotection as determined by appropriate subject matter experts and bioenvironmental engineers is highlyrecommended. AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006129Military mishap safety investigators have developed a list of photographs that can be used for forensicanalysis of aircraft mishaps by safety and medical personnel. Initial photographic support is normally pro-vided by alert photographers under the initial direction of the ISB Medical Officer and ISB InvestigatingOfficer. The photographers also support the Services Mortuary Officer for documenting remains and per-sonal effects during the search and recovery process. For contingency situations where mishap safety photography is not available, Services should plan to pro-vide some photographic coverage. When possible, follow these four general coverage requirements. If adigital camera is not available, even disposable film cameras can provide adequate support if they canprovide somewhat wide angle and close-up shots. Remember to carry a small (at least 6 inch) ruler forperspective in close-up shots. 1. Wide view approach shots of the overall mishap site and the major mishap features from severalangles. 2. Closer broad area shots that capture the main points of emphasis (i.e., intact, major portions, andfragmented remains) with major mishap features somewhere in the background. 3. Close-ups of the individual remains (intact remains and nearly intact remains), personal effects,and fragmented remains. 4. For areas that have a large number of fragmented remains (i.e., a remains field), then take wideangle  photos  of  the  remains  field  and  close-up  photos  of  individual  remains  in  relation  to  theremains field. 130AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006Due to joint service commitments, the Air Force Services Mortuary Affairs search and recovery (S&R)nomenclature for marking intact remains, portions of remains, and personal effects will be the Joint Pub-lication 4-06 nomenclature, with variations only as necessary. Teams conducting S&R must completeS&R tags, which are blank tags with ties. NOTE: Try and obtain cloth tags (approximately 2-1/2 inch by 5 inch minimum, in white or manila) with either wire or twine ties for tagging remains, portions of remains, and personal effects.  The larger cloth tags are easier to write on in the field and there is less chance of them being damaged or becoming illegible when tagging portions of remains.  Shipping tags on the outside of human remains pouches should have reinforced holes and wire ties.  Some tags are available as National Stock Number items (NSN 8135-00-178-9193 or NSN 8135-00-292-2345), but tags are also available commercially.   Air Force markings on tags will follow the primary requirements of Joint Publication 4-06, Joint Tactics,Techniques, and Procedures for Mortuary Affairs in Joint Operations, which identifies the primary con-ventions for marking remains, portions of remains, and personal effects. Modify the markings only asnecessary to meet the mishap situation, maintain consistency, and provide for accurate records. The interim safety board (ISB) Investigating Officer and Medical Officer are to mark life support or per-sonal equipment on remains that must be removed to preserve evidence. For Class A fatal mishaps whenServices personnel are present for S&R, the marking method for any special equipment or items (desig-nated by an inspector or investigator) can be made using another designation. This should not disrupt nor-mal S&R marking using E-# designations for personal effects. Military and federal investigators may useother markers as necessary for marking during investigations, but may use another flag with a differentmarking designation or color (such as an “S-#” designation) if needed when many special markers arerequired. To ensure that the various ways of marking will be standardized and used on site, marking schemes shouldbe addressed and adopted in pre-mishap planning, such as emergency action plans, response plans, andoperating instructions. This will provide ISB members or other investigators with a knowledge of theother marking methods being used on site for marking and recovering remains, personal effects, and spe-cial equipment items that may have to be removed to preserve them. As previously noted, safety and otherinvestigating officers may use other specific marking scheme colors and designations for investigationpurposes. Contact the on-scene commander, authority with jurisdiction at the scene, ISB or SIB Investi-gating Officer, or criminal investigators to coordinate or deconflict the use of marking. Ensure that CEEAs are also aware of the final decisions on marking to ensure that their maps address the various typesof marking. Before beginning any S&R operation, you must decide on the chosen marking methods that fit the situa-tion, make sure they are consistent, and ensure that data will be recorded. For most S&R operations the information regarding the recovering unit designation and branch of serviceshould be used if the remains must be processed through another branch of the armed forces prior to ship-AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006131ping the remains to the place of final preparation and release, or to Dover for OCONUS and contingencydeaths. All tags should show the date when marked. NOTE: The primary exception to using the “R-#”, “P-#”, and “E-#” designation marking on tags and stakes is for contingency deployments when hostilities or unsafe conditions require an expedient recovery.  For expedient recoveries there is no required marking on stakes and tags in the field, although tagging should be accomplished as soon as possible from data gathered and recorded in the field. The following tables and figures provide additional information. Table E-1 identifies a marking systemfor remains (by type), personal effects, and any specially identified equipment. Figure E-1 identifies asuggested S&R tag marking system. Table E-2 identifies a suggested format for recording data on mark-ers. Figure E-2 identifies marking conventions for grid or crater marking.

Each grid should be designated with a number and/or letter, which should be shown in a simple legend. The normal convention for stating a grid coordinate can use an X and Y coordinate system. This avoids having to force your efforts to fit a North-South grid system (like latitude and longitude), if using latitude and longitude does not present the best alignment for search efforts or your plotting.    134AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006Figure E-2. Standard Convention for Grid or Crater Measurement. AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006135The procedures you use in training for a search and recovery (S&R) operation should be similar andfamiliar enough that S&R team members are comfortable with using and modifying them (as needed) inthe field. It is not possible to train for all contingency situations that you could encounter. Standard sweepsearches versus obstructed area lane searches versus grid searches share some common procedures andtechniques, while the separation between team members is a primary difference. Most searches have someform of a follow-up team for bagging, tagging, and recovery. Searching within an obstructed area canrequire having a dedicated, well-equipped follow-up team to take the time necessary to search around anobstacle, tree, or other impediment. [They do this while the sweep portion of the lane search continues.]Grid searches are constricted areas and require that personnel work closer together in an even closer line.Bagging, tagging, and removal are fairly standardized. Some issues may arise as to the width of a searchline or lane, how to maintain separation, and how to mark remains and personal effects. There have beenquestions raised on directing the march and whether there should be talking or voice directions for eachmovement. There is no prime directive –– you use what you have to use to get the job done properly andsafely. As a guide, the following information (based on sweep and lane searches) can be used for practiceand in the field. Forward Progress: The line must proceed together. The line does not have to progress across the searcharea or down a lane using one large lock-step at a time. The line should proceed at a slow, halting pacethat allows members adequate time to look left, look right, look down, look up (if trees, bushes, or otheroverhangs exist), and look toward their line buddies. This takes practice and should be practiced not onlyon an open field, but also in deep grass and low brush or ground cover. When members are trying to takeone lock-step at a time through rough ground, tall grass, low or taller brush, or a crop field, they maybecome preoccupied with taking each step to keep pace and not look at how-where they are going. Sweep teams should progress together about 24 to 30 inches at a time, taking one progress step forwardat a time (i.e., either one large or two to three small steps as needed to avoid obstacles and slippery sur-faces). While watching for and avoiding sharp objects, line members may have to (learn to) shuffle theirfeet somewhat to work their way through taller grass, crops, or ground cover. This helps to part the vege-tation and not push it down on top of remains. It is the job of the team leader, flankers, S&R OICs/NCOICs, or S&R team chief that may be present to oversee the march and communicate together to makesure the line speed is not too fast, and that line members are not being overcome by stress or fatigue. Personal Lane Widths. Marching in formation may be a military tradition on a parade field or at a cere-mony. However, it is not a normal process to march in a fixed line through brush, forests, grasslands,swamps, snow fields, hillsides, cactus-covered deserts, or plowed agricultural fields while also searchingfor remains, personal effects, and hazardous materials. Movement becomes even more difficult whensome or all members are encumbered with ropes, machetes, hiking staffs, or snowshoes and ski poles.S&R members must keep together in a line and maintain the same relative spacing to avoid missingremains and personal effects. Make provisions for a trailing team with tools and equipment to cover anobstructed area when the line cannot penetrate some locations within the forward sweep. 136AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006Figure F-1. Adequate Lane Widths. Peripheral Vision. Members often misjudge the distance between them and their line buddies when justusing their peripheral view. You cannot rely strictly on peripheral vision to maintain separation. Linemembers need to look at their line buddies after every few steps. This is especially true when members areworking farther apart due to wearing or carrying equipment or working in brush. A search line is a buddycare situation, as you may be the first person to see that something is wrong with your line buddy, such asheat exhaustion, dizziness, mental stress, ticks and other biting insects, leaches, hazardous liquids andother substances, or cuts and scrapes. When walking through brush, it is even possible to pick up smallscattered human remains or waste on your clothing. Available team leaders, flankers, and trailing teammembers can help keep members in line. When working in tall grass or swamps, having a spotter (with aradio) elevated on a ladder may be necessary to help keep members in line and spaced. AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006Figure F-2. Perception of Lane Widths.  137Cross sweeps. Using a sweep and cross sweep technique can be a thorough, relatively fast method tosweep an area for remains and personal effects. However, in some locations, a cross sweep may not be asvaluable a technique as using more personnel working closer together and having them proceed only onetime across an area. This is often the case when working in agricultural areas where crops are in denserows. By having one person walk in the lane between crop rows, each S&R member would search theground surface and through the crop on both sides. In taller grass and grain fields, it is important to nottramp down the grass or grain stems. Shuffle and walk between them like the teeth on a giant comb. Youshould be able to see about the same amount of ground surface before and after you pass through. Lookfor areas of the grass or grain crop that show signs of having been knocked down. What do remains look like? A sweep or lane search may find scattered larger fragments of the body(such as a foot, hand, leg, head, main torso), while a crater or impact area search often finds charredremains (whether whole or partial) and highly fragmented remains. Often clinging dirt and soot make theremains look more like dampened clods of soil. Charred remains may look little different than somecharred structural or fabric debris or wreckage. Always have the medical officer, experienced core teammembers, or fire rescue personnel brief the team on the status of the remains and what they should belooking for. Rule of thumb: When in doubt, mark and collect it. S&R members and inexperienced person-nel, including fire rescue and medical personnel should err on the side of caution by collecting anythingthat might be human remains and then letting the medical examiner and anthropologist make the finaldeterminations. Who should mark remains? A sweep line can call trailing members forward to mark and tag remains.However, if using colored flags and flagging materials, these materials are small, lightweight, and com-pact. The flags and flagging can be carried by experienced sweep line personnel and used to markremains upon finding during each progress step. Small remains can be marked after notifying the closestteam member with radio communications such as the team leader, a flanker, or a follow team member138AFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006such as the S&R officer or NCO. Larger remains may require more than marking the remains with a flag.If there are issues of dignity or recognition by the news media or others, consider having a follow membercover the remains with a sheet or portions of a sheet until remains can be recovered. Sheets also drawattention and let any investigators or medical personnel know that larger remains are present. When work-ing in taller grass, crops, brush, or among trees, use a flag and add streamers of same-colored flagging(tied to the flag or nearby crop, brush, or tree) to draw additional attention. Notify the nearest team leader,flanker, or follow-team member that remains have been found. Using hand signs, voice, loudspeakers, radios and other methods to control search procedures.Using loud commands and oral procedures may be necessary for safety’s sake during some sweeps. How-ever, control procedures that work in an open field may not work when personnel are encumbered withequipment, vision is obscured by brush and trees, and there are inclement weather conditions. Some handsigns and shouting commands at locations within public view may appear irreverent to onlookers whenS&R members march together and raise their hands in a thumbs-up sign after each pace forward. Loudvoices trying to yell line commands, especially over a long period of time when voices begin to wear out,can also be misinterpreted by team members and the public or media. With too much noise and effortaround, an S&R member who raises a hand upon finding remains and yells to gain attention may not beseen or heard. They can be visually lost even on a sweep line if the line is using a raised arm, thumbs-upsigns (to signify no remains) or in denser tall brush or trees where a raised arm is lost in the foliage. Theirvoice may be drowned out (when there are many other raised voices present at or on site or in the line) orjust from the wind blowing through trees and brush. Whatever you determine are the best communicationmethods for your possible locales (whether mountains, plains, swamps, brush lands, etc.), practice themfrequently. If possible, especially when working in public view, try to use enough small radios (i.e., check with basecommunications regarding use of palm size FRS/GMRS two-way radios if secure radios are in short sup-ply) with headsets to allow positive line control. Two-way radios can help in conducting quieter line com-munications. However, even using simple whistles on the line (one medium blast for remains, two shortblasts for personal effects, and a loud long blast to obtain advice or safety-medical support) can be usedvery effectively everywhere. Whistles may be unadvisable in a higher threat contingency situation. [Letother personnel on site know if whistles will be used and what the signals mean.] Try to maintain a somewhat quiet line sweep without yelling commands. Expect and allow some low-key,controlled line chatter, as low volume talk can be an important coping mechanism during a critical inci-dent. It also keeps members from clamming up – they are better prepared to speak up with concerns orproblems and gain help. Line chatter should still be somewhat limited and always avoid gallows humor,as other line members, survivors, relatives, friends, and bystanders could overhear and may not under-stand or appreciate what was said. Joking can become excessive, so control humor. It could cause nervousor emotional laughing from over-stressed individuals and this could also be misinterpreted. Chattershould not be loud enough to prevent someone from gaining attention. There should be no chatter overthe radio. Using tools. Hand tools (such as rakes, shovels, and gardening hand tools) and reach tongs should be usedto handle remains to the extent that the remains are extricated from something (such as imbedded in theground, debris, larger wreckage, or brush and trees). The tools are used to remove the ground surfacematerials or debris from around the remains until the remains can be picked up with gloved hand(s) ormedical forceps. Long reaching (snake grabber) tongs can be used to grasp some remains (such as in trees,bushes, swamps) and stabilize them to allow dignified removal by personnel. When required for safetyAFH10-247V4   20 JANUARY 2006139reasons, these reaching tools may have to be used to extricate some remains, such as lifting the remainsfrom fuel-covered water, hazardous materials, or from a location where wreckage or debris could causecrushing injuries to recovery personnel. Whenever possible, always try to use ladders, reach vehicles orstands, or bucket trucks to reach and lower remains from trees or other elevated locations. NOTE: If the use of tools changes or damages remains or other personal effects or equipment, note this in the log of events and on the remains marking log.  This will help prevent false interpretation of injury by the medical examiner.  Shovels, picks, and hand tools can cause extensive remains and other artifact damage that is difficult to differentiate from actual injuries or accident related damage. ARTHUR J.
