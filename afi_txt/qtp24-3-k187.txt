Keeping a foot on the service brake pedal, shift the transmission gearshift lever to reverse (R).  5.6.9.3.  Release service brake pedal and gradually depress the accelerator pedal.  Note:  The vehicle’s speedometer does not indicate reverse speeds.  The operator must estimate the vehicle’s speed and use good judgment when driving in reverse.  5.6.10.  Drive the vehicle in four-wheel drive (4WD).  5.6.10.1. Shift from two-wheel drive (2WD) to 4WD by shifting the transfer case from 2H to 4H.  5.6.10.2. Drive the truck forward.      Note:  If it is not possible to move vehicle to shift transfer case, it can be shifted by shifting the transmission gearshift lever to neutral (N) then shifting the transfer case control lever firmly but not forcefully.  If shifting the transfer case is difficult, it may be necessary to temporarily shift the transmission gearshift lever to D then back to N and try again to shift the transfer case.  5.6.10.3. Shift the transfer case from 2H to 4H to 4L.  Table 5.1.  Transfer Case Gears.  Gear 2H 4H 4L Description Used for driving on normal, improved roads.  Only the rear wheels are driving the vehicle. This gear is for driving in 4WD through snow and mud but road conditions are not severe. This gear is for driving in 4WD when conditions are severe.  Example – Off-road through several inches of mud or when pulling a towed trailer through mud or when the vehicle is stuck in mud or snow.  5.6.10.4. Stop the vehicle and set the parking brake.  5.6.10.5. Shift transmission gearshift lever to N.  5.6.10.6. Release parking brake.  5.6.10.7. Shift the transfer case control lever firmly, but not forcefully, to 4L.  5.6.10.8. Return to 2WD from 4WD.  5.6.10.8.1.   Return 2H from 4H.  5.6.10.8.2.   Shift the transmission gearshift lever to D or appropriate forward gear.  5.6.10.8.3.   With  the  vehicle  in  motion,  momentarily  release  the  accelerator  and, firmly but not forcefully, shift the transfer case control lever according to the pattern indicated on the lever.  5.6.10.9. Return to 2H or 4H from 4L.  5.6.10.9.1.   Stop the vehicle and set the parking brake.  5.6.10.9.2.   Shift the transmission gearshift lever to N.   5.6.10.9.3.

Note:  Do not shift transmission gearshift lever to park (P) on a hill before setting parking brake.  This puts force on the transmission and makes it difficult to shift the transmission gearshift lever out of P.  Make sure that the transfer case is in gear.  5.6.11.1. Bring vehicle to a complete stop.  5.6.11.2. Set  parking  brake  by  depressing  the  service  brake  pedal  with  right  foot,  and holding it while setting parking brake with left foot.  Caution:  If the transfer case control lever is in N, the transfer case is disengaged and shifting the transmission gearshift lever to P will not stop the truck from moving and result in injury or property damage.  5.6.11.3. Ensure that the transfer case is in gear.  5.6.11.4. Shift the transmission gearshift lever to P.  5.6.11.5. Move all switches to the OFF position.  5.6.11.6.
