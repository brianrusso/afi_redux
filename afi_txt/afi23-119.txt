There are two types of GFP: Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) and Government Furnished Material (GFM). 1.1.2  GFE consists of property, special tooling, or special test property provided to the contractor for activities such as research and development, acquisition, repair, maintenance, overhaul, or modification. 1.1.3  GFM is another form of Government property that is provided to the contractor in the performance of a contract. GFM consists of raw titanium, nuts, bolts, washers, screws, spares, and reparable assets. GFM does not include property, special tooling, or test property and is consumed or expended by the contractor during the performance of the contract. •  NOTE: Contractor Acquired Property (CAP) becomes government property upon delivery and acceptance by the government.  2.0  Purpose and Scope.  2.1  This guide provides clear processes and guidance for the proper management and accountability of government property provided to the contractor. 2.2  This process guide defines the roles and responsibilities of each functional area and all stakeholders involved in the accountability process. 2.3  AFMC/A4 is the “Central” Point for providing and managing all AF property and government furnished property in the AF inventory; therefore this guide is applicable to all MAJCOMs, to include Air Force Space Command (AFSPC), Program Executive Offices (PEOs), and AFMC centers requiring property be furnished to a contractor for the performance of a contract. 3.0  GFP Process Flow. 3.1  Entry Criteria  3.1.1  GFP required for contract. See reference Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) Procedures, Guidance, and Information (PGI) 245.103-70 “Furnishing Government Property to Contractors.” 3.1.2  The requiring activity or program management office of primary responsibility (OPR) will identify the property and provide justification for providing it to the contracting office IAW the elements attached in FAR Part 45.102   “Government Property Policy” and PGI 245.103-70 “Furnishing Government property to contractors.”  See References in Tables Below. 3.1.3  Existing contracts enter the GFP Process Flow when applicable GFP process activities occur, such as contract modifications affecting GFP or disposition of GFP at contract completion. 3.2  Inputs: Complete identification and documented justification of GFP.  GFP clauses included in the contract, pursuant to FAR 45.107 - “Contract Clauses”, DFARS 211.274.6 - “Contract Clauses”, and DFAR 245.107 - “Contract Clauses.” 3.3  Outputs: Accountability in the Accountable Property System of Record (APSR) and completed inventory reports. 3.4  Exit Criteria 3.4.1  GFP is removed from the contract when no longer required for the performance of that contract. IAW Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 45 and FAR 52.245-1, the contractor will promptly perform and report to the property administrator contract property closeout, to include reporting, investigating, and securing closure of all loss of government property cases; physically inventorying all property upon termination or completion of contract; and disposing of items at the time determined by the government to be excess to the contract. 3.4.2  FAR 45.6 “Reporting, Reutilization, and Disposal,” establishes policies and procedures for the reporting, reutilization, and disposal of contractor inventory excess to contracts and of property that forms the basis of a claim against the Government (e.g., termination inventory under fixed-price contracts).    Figure 1.

GFP Process Flow Activities Step  Activity Description OPR 1 2 3 4 4.1 5 5.1 6 7 The Need for a contract  Requirements generator has established a new requirement that will require a contract. Program Office (Contracting) GFP Required; yes or no? Identify known GFP requirements  Form Integrated Product Team and Determine GFP Supportability and Conduct Justification Analysis and Include Disposition Instructions in Draft SOW.  Product Support Manager/LG Involvement GFP Justified and Supportable; yes or no? Contactor must provide; enter the CAP process Conduct Acquisition Strategy Panel (ASP)  When yes, continue to step 3. When no, then the contractor is responsible for providing all equipment for the performance of the contract.  Begin the Contractor Acquired Property (CAP) process (Ref Table 4). The contractor may also furnish the required equipment for the performance of the contract.   When GFP is found to be applicable at a later date, return to step 2. Program Office prepares a list of all known GFP requirements IAW AFI 63-101 - “Government Furnished Property.” (Added 20-101); AFMAN 17-1203 “IT Asset Management” Program Manager (PM) / Logistics Management Specialist (LMS) forms an IPT of all stakeholders to include at a minimum: the contracting officer, resource manager, the engineer, the equipment specialist, and, if required, the requiring activity / major command.  This IPT determines if the known list of GFP is supportable and provides documentation to the contracting officer. The Program Office develops the Government Property Decision Document and ensures it addresses each element required by DFARS PGI 245.103-70 “Furnishing Government Property to Contractors.” Program Office provides the Decision Document to the Contracting Officer as part of the Requirements Package. Product Support Manager provides support to the justification analysis as required.  When GFP is determined to be justified and supportable, move to step 6. When GFP is determined not to be supportable, begin the CAP process (reference Table 4). When GFP is determined not to be justified, the contractor provides the property at no cost to the government.  When GFP is found to be applicable at a later date, return to step 2. The contractor must provide the property when GFP is determined not to be supportable for the performance of the contract. FAR Part 7 - 7.105 -- Contents of Written Acquisition Plans - Government-furnished property. Indicate any Government property to be furnished to contractors, and discuss any associated considerations, such as its availability or the schedule for its acquisition (see FAR 45.102).  DFARS PGI 245.103-70 Furnishing Government Property to Contractors. The requiring activity (project or program manager, or purchase request generator), as part of its responsibility for acquisition planning (FAR part 7, Acquisition Planning), is the decision point as to whether or not to furnish property to contractors. The basis for any decision to provide Government Property is documented per step 4..  Program Office (Program Management) Program Office (Program Management) Product Support Manager/LG Program Office (Program Management) Contractor  Program Office (Program Management) Submit approved initial GFP Attachment to contracting  The GFP attachment is prepared using DOD’s mandatory Government Furnished Property Attachment format, IAW DFARS PGI 245.103-72, for inclusion in the draft Request for Proposal (RFP).

GFP Process Flow Return Activities Step  Activity Description Requiring activity establishes GFE is no longer required for contract performance.  This can happen in a variety of ways: 1.  Program office identifies GFE on the contract that is no longer required. 2.  The end of the period of performance for the contract to which the GFE is accountable is imminent. 3.  The end of the loan for an authorized piece of GFE is imminent. 4.  The Contractor identifies GFE no longer required for the contract and sends a request for disposition into the program office. Program Office forms a team to develop disposition instructions for GFE no longer required for contract performance.  Program Manager / Logistics Management Specialist (LMS) will form an IPT to include at a minimum: the contracting officer, resource manager, product support manager (PSM), LCO, AFMC/A4, and, if required, the requiring activity / major command, equipment specialist, and engineering.    NOTE: AFMC/A4 notifies the program office via email when GFE is due within 60 calendar days and follow-up when not resolved within 30 calendar days and again when overdue.   Contracting receives disposition instructions from Program Office.

GFP Process Flow CAP Step  Activity Description 1 Potential for CAP identified. Contractor acquires property titled to the Government, by virtue of contract type, financing provisions, specific requirements of the contract, or by the identification of property as a deliverable item. Potential for delivery and acceptance; yes or no? Reference PGI  245.402-71 (ii)(B) The requiring activity GFE IPT reviews Addendum B to assess when a delivery requirement for CAP may arise during contract performance. The requiring activity bases the assessment on program history or knowledge of requirements to include, ST and STE with special storage requirements; or equipment meeting or exceeding the DoD capitalization threshold; and the mandate to deliver and accept CAP before (1) transferring CAP to another contract for use as GFP (to include the follow-on contract), (2) transitioning CAP to GFP under the current contract, or (3) delivering CAP to the AF as government property. When yes, move to step 3.  When no, continue with GFE process and address unanticipated delivery of CAP, as needed. OPR Program Office (Program Management/ Contracting) Program Office (Program Management) Develop CAP management approach The requiring activity decides on a CAP management approach, considering the potential need for reporting requirements, the type of CAP to be delivered (Equipment, ST/STE), any specific marking requirements, or delivery instructions, known at the time. The requiring activity provides any unique CAP management requirements to the contracting office. Program Office (Program Management) Incorporate CAP requirements into contract Immediate need for CAP delivery; yes or no? Initiate CAP Delivery and Acceptance  Execute CAP Delivery Instructions Execute according to disposition instructions  Compile CAP records  Contracting ensures solicitation and contract reflect CAP management approach developed by requiring activity, to include data reporting requirements, the line item structure and descriptive data, IUID marking requirements, and any other specific instructions needed to facilitate the delivery of CAP on a contract line item of the contract. Program Office (Contracting) When no, continue with GFE process until delivery requirement arises. When yes, proceed to step 6.

Addendum A   Manual Upload of GFP Attachments to the Electronic Document Access (EDA)   This addendum describes the process to upload Government Furnished Property (GFP) attachments into EDA. This process provides a standardized, repeatable method to ensure GFP attachments post to EDA in the correct attachment type and as a separate and distinct document from the contract. The process assumes the Program Office provides a complete attachment in the format required by DFARS 245.103-72. Unless all steps of the process occur, the property information contained in the GFP attachments will not flow to the IUID Registry. MAJCOM or local procedures may centralize the upload process, but responsibility resides with the individual Contracting Officer.   Step 1. Role Authorization. Uploading contract attachments requires approval and authorization beyond the “View Only” access to EDA most users have. To obtain the “Contract Attachment” capability, request the “Upload Attachments/Admin Docs” role from your EDA Point of Contact. Request this role as soon as  possible.  Confirm  assignment  to  the  appropriate  issuing  office  DODAAC,  as  EDA  limits  upload attachment rights by this code.   Step 2. Contract Assembly. Assemble contacts in accordance with existing contract writing system (CWS) processes and procedures. Use only properly completed attachments, in the format required by DFARS 245.103-72 and provided by the Program Office (Program Management OPR, requiring activity, etc.). Incorporate  an  image-based  (human-readable,  scanned)  copy  of  the  GFP  attachment  during  contract assembly, if the CWS cannot utilize the text-based (machine extractable, “smart form”) version of the GFP  attachment.  Ensure  the  text-based  attachment  manually  uploaded  to  EDA  is  an  accurate representation of the image-based attachment incorporated in the underlying contract.  Step 3. Contract Distribution. Distribute the contract document IAW existing procedures. Centralized contract automation does not resolve the contracting officer’s contract distribution responsibility, which includes uploading attachments to EDA.  Step 4. Manual Upload. Upload a text-based (machine extractable) version of the GFP attachment within 5 business days of the contract posting to EDA. If a centralized distribution function completes Step 4, then proceed to Step 5. If not, start the upload step by finding the applicable contract in EDA and clicking   the “Add" link in the “Attachments” column.  If attachments already exist on the contract, the screen displays a "View (#)" link with a number which represents the quantity of attachments. When uploading a GFP attachment, label it correctly. In the “Attachment Type” drop down selection, select “Government Furnished  Equipment  List”  for  the  GFP  attachment.  In  the  “Attachment  Description,”  name  GFP attachments as “Government Furnished Property”. See Table 1 for visual guidance.    Table 1 - Enter Attachment Data: GFP Example  GFP (GFP) Attachment                       Step 5. Verification. Verify completion of an upload to EDA using the simple three-step process. First, check  EDA’s  contract  list  “Attachments”  column  to  make  sure  a  "View  (#)"  link  appears.  This  link indicates  a  proper  attachment  upload.  However,  these  attachments  may  be  GFP  attachments  or  other contract  attachments,  such  as  the  signed  front  page  of  the  contract.  Next,  click  the  link  to  open  the attachments folder to see if it includes a “Government Furnished Equipment List” for the GFP attachment. Click on the link(s) to open the attachment. If the text-based (machine extractable) GFP document opens, then the upload process was correctly followed. See Table 2.           Table 2 - Steps to Verify Attachment Upload: GFP Example   1. Attachment column displays   "View(#)" link indicating upload 2. Folder contains link to GFP Attachment   3. Link opens text-based (machine extractable) GFP attachment      Step 6. Maintenance.  Contract modifications changing a GFP attachment follow the same process.  Do  not use EDA’s “Modify” or “Delete” attachment functions for previously uploaded   Addendum B       Table 1 - CAP Risk Table  Management of Contractor Acquired Property (CAP)   Improperly delivered contractor acquired property (CAP) negatively affects AF accountability and auditability objectives. This addendum sets forth management options for avoiding negative outcomes and facilitating delivery and acceptance of CAP in a disciplined manner. Accordingly, representatives of  the  Government  Furnished  Equipment  (GFE)  Integrated  Product  Team  (IPT)  should  review Sections 1 and 2 early in the acquisition process.  Step 1 - Managing CAP, outlines the relationship between CAP and AF property accountability requirements and Section 2 - Options to Proactively Manage CAP, provides several flexible, tailorable approaches to control CAP, sooner rather than later. If a review of both sections does not indicate a need for proactive management approach, then the GFE IPT will rely on a reactive, ad hoc approach. In such cases, Section 3 - Mandatory Requirements for  CAP  Delivery  clarifies  the  minimum  requirements  to  deliver  and  accept  unanticipated  CAP. Finally, Section 4 - Delivery Not Required, describes actions and events that do not necessitate delivery and acceptance.   Section  1.  Managing  CAP.  Program  Managers/Requesting  Activities  have  the  responsibility  to manage CAP (Reference (a)) and contracting officers must award and manage contracts in accordance with  the  FAR,  DFARS,  and  AFFARS  (Reference  (b),  (c),  (d)).  Effective  management  requires  a balance  of  two  competing  interests.  On  the  one  hand,  “Accountable  property  records  shall  not  be established  for  CAP  until  delivery  to  the  Department  of  Defense  has  occurred”  (Reference  (e)). Acquisitions  that  do  not  require  delivery  and  acceptance  of  CAP  have  no  effect  on  AF  property accountability. Therefore, the AF Accountable Property System of Record (APSR) does not include records for this portion of Government Property and oversight is limited only to reviews and audits of contractor accounting and property management systems. On the other hand, if delivery occurs, or should  have  occurred,  then  the  AF  inherits  an  immediate  accountability  requirement.  In  such circumstances, the GFE IPT must deliver and accept each item of CAP under a contract line item and create a corresponding record in the APSR (Reference (a)). This applies when delivering CAP to the AF and when converting CAP to GFP for use under the current contract, a follow on contract, or by another contractor. Only through formal delivery and acceptance under a contract line item will the AF obtain the information necessary to establish an accountable record, clear rights to ownership, and the key  supporting  documents  needed  for  audit  readiness.  Section  2  provides  a  deliberate  approach  to manage CAP, with these two interests in mind, based on specific risk factors inherent to an acquisition (see Table 1).              Section 2. Options to Proactively Manage CAP. In most situations, existing policies, regulations, and contract clauses adequately manage CAP. Throughout contract performance, the contractor manages, consumes, expends, purchases, returns, or otherwise disposes of CAP, transparent to the AF. In such cases, Program Managers and Requesting Activities gain little from above-and-beyond management practices, such as recurring CAP reports. In fact, DFARS PGI 245.402-70(1) explicitly states, “Ad-hoc contractor  generated  reports  of  contractor-acquired  property  used  by  government  personnel  for ‘property  accountability’  can  result  in  duplicate  accountability  records,  inefficient  operations,  and increased program costs, and are discouraged.” Nonetheless, GFE IPT members supporting complex weapon systems programs, contracts with significant amounts of CAP or CAP of significant value, should assess CAP more closely. This includes programs or contracts with critical, highly useful items, those with a history of improperly “rolling over” CAP into successor contracts without formal delivery, and those containing items on a GFP attachment’s reimbursable list. In any of these cases, the GFE IPT could use the following proactive options to identify and manage CAP long in advance of a delivery requirement, streamline the acceptance process, and facilitate records population in the APSR.  a. Contract Reporting Requirements   i. Type. When the Program Office (Program Management OPR, requiring activity, etc.), decides to identify CAP via recurring reports, the preferred option is a CAP-only Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL) (see attachment 1). This deliverable provides a report of CAP for the requiring activity to review and consider for delivery at the appropriate time. Reporting includes data elements needed to create a record in the APSR, if and when those items are delivered. If program requirements dictate additional reporting of Government Furnished Property (GFP), consider using the CAP and GFP CDRL (see attachment 2). Both reports require information over and above the FAR and DFARS property clauses, and likely result in additional cost to the program and require added Government resources to review and take action on the information reported by the contractor.   ii. Timing. When using a CDRL, the Program Office , should consider when initial and final reports should occur along with the frequency of interim deliverables, and then adjust CDRL timing as needed (i.e., DD 1423 Blocks 10, 12, and 13). Adjustments should take into account period of performance, program complexity, and anticipated amount of property acquired, fabricated, or otherwise provided by the  contractor.  The  final  submission  should  occur  within  60-90  days  of  contract completion/termination.  iii. Tailoring. The Program Office may tailor or limit the reporting to those items, types, or classes of property most likely to have a delivery requirement, or would otherwise benefit from reporting. For example, CAP in overseas or contingency locations, or historically prone to improper “roll over” on to follow-on contracts. Also, consider requiring the contractor to submit a reutilization and disposition recommendation along with the final submission. To maximize standardization across the AF, tailoring should focus on the flexibilities contained in this process guide and the administrative requirements of the requiring activity.   b. Pre-established Contract Structure   i.  Type.  The  Contracting  Office  should  consider  a  pre-established  contract  structure  to  facilitate delivery and acceptance of CAP under a contract line item based on requirements provided by the Program Office. The structure should use a mix of parent Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs), sub line item numbers (SLINs), and exhibit line item numbers (ELINs) appropriate to the circumstances If the Program Office provides a CAP-only or CAP-GFP CDRL in the requirements package, then the   contract  structure  must  allow  for  CAP  identification  on  ELINs  (see  attachment  3).  If  a  CDRL  is unnecessary, the GFE  IPT may still consider incorporating  a basic parent CLIN/subCLIN  contract structure  (see  attachment  4).  The  structure  must  follow  FAR  and  DFARS  line  item  structure requirements  and  should  include  additional  administrative  information  provided  by  the  requiring activity.  ii. Timing. Establish a CAP CLIN structure as soon as it is apparent that CAP will be delivered. This includes situations when CAP converts to GFP under the current contract, a follow-on contract, or any other contract. Creating a CLIN may occur as early as a draft solicitation, through the point when a delivery requirement arises, right up to contract completion.  See Section 3 if adding a line item after physical completion of the contract.   iii. Tailoring. The Program Office should inform the contracting office (1) whether the anticipated CAP is equipment, special tooling, special test equipment, or material, (2) if they intend to require reporting  via  CDRL,  and,  if  known,  (3)  the  rough  magnitude  of  potentially  delivered  CAP.  The contracting office uses this information to create a parent CLIN for the delivery of each CAP type, the CDRL requirement, and structure any subordinate CLINs. In general, a subCLINs may accommodate delivery of a limited number of items, whereas ELINs would streamline delivery of a lengthy list. In addition,  the  contracting  office  should  establish  Parent  CLINs  to  clarify  deliverables  are  (1)  “Not Separately Priced (NSP)”, (2) delivered F.O.B. destination, and (3) to be marked in accordance with Item Unique Identification (IUID) requirements. Also, IAW DFARS PGI 245.402-71 each distinct item (i.e., Sub-CLIN, ELIN) must include the following data elements, to include serial number/ Unique Item Identified (UII), if known:                 c. Early Identification of CAP Required for Delivery If the Program Office can identify the individual CAP items or groups of items required for delivery, then the contract line item description could identify the items in advance of delivery. Note this step provides details beyond the rough magnitude described in paragraph b. Although some data elements will remain unknown until delivery, a basic outline of the identifying data and assignment of line item numbers (e.g., ELIN, sub-CLIN) may streamline delivery and acceptance. At such time, the contractor would provide the remaining information for each item of CAP, as required. The contract should not incorporate CAP not anticipated for delivery, for example, by incorporating the contractor’s proposed Bill of Materials (BOM) into a contract line item or attachment.   Section  3.  Mandatory  Requirements  for  CAP  Delivery.  The  AF  must  have  accountability  of delivered and accepted CAP. The proactive management approach at Section 2 integrates with Section 3 to reduce the burden during the delivery phase. Nonetheless, in the event of unanticipated delivery requirements or times if proactive management did not occur, the GFE IPT should execute an expedited approach to deliver and accept CAP via contract line item. Follow this section to determine if delivery is required, properly deliver and accept, populate the APSR with information on delivered items, and modify the contract.

Decision to Require Delivery The  added  burden  and  liability  inherent  to  GFP  requires  a  disciplined  approach  to  CAP  delivery requirements. However, if delivery requirements arise, then delivery and acceptance must occur in accordance with DFARS 245.402-71 requirements. When the contractor requests retention of CAP for use on a follow on contract, and the GFE IPT approves, then delivery under a line item must occur.  As another example, if the requiring activity or logistics function requires return of excess items on the RGFP  attachment’s  Reimbursable  List,  or  items  reported  via  the  CAP  CDRL,  then  delivery  and acceptance must occur under a contract line item. All of these examples necessitate formal delivery and acceptance. Regulations do not permit undocumented, informal “roll over” of CAP from one contract to another, CAP becomes GFP in this case.    b. Delivery and Acceptance Event Taking delivery of CAP is much the same as the delivery of any other item purchased by contract. The contractor invoices and reports delivery of CAP items via iRAPT (Invoicing, Receipt, Acceptance and Property Transfer) and ships the marked items to the desired delivery location, in accordance with Wide Area Workflow  (WAWF),  IUID, and  GFP clauses and any additional requirements dictated in  the contract. An authorized representative of the Government accepts these items through iRAPT, at which point the CAP business rules (Reference (f)) no longer apply, the property becomes accountable to the AF, and Product Support Manager/Logistics OPR, must establish a record of the property in the APSR. When subsequently  furnished to a contractor, or immediately in the case of shipment-in-place, the property becomes GFP and must be documented and processed IAW GFP regulations and policies.    c. Populating the APSR An accountable record of delivered and accepted CAP must exist in the APSR. The Program Office provides property data and records of delivered CAP to Product Support Manager/Logistics OPR, who in turn uses the information to populate the APSR. The CLIN descriptive data contains the minimum data elements of an accountable property record; however, a CDRL could be tailored to a specific APSR’s data fields in order to streamline population of a specific APSR (e.g., AFEMS). Delivery also creates key documents, for example the DD 250 (Material Inspection and Receiving Report), to support the audit trail of delivered CAP residing on the AF property books.    d. Contract Modifications  The specific circumstances dictate the required contract modification(s). For example, when converting CAP to GFP with the current contractor, the contracting office modifies the contract to deliver and accept CAP on a CLIN and add the transitioned CAP items as GFP. When transferring CAP to a follow-on contract, the contracting office modifies the current contract to deliver and accept CAP, provide the delivery location of the follow-on contractor, and then ensure the follow-on contract appropriately adds the transitioned CAP as GFP. When the AF takes possession of CAP, the contracting office modifies the contract to deliver and accept CAP and provides the delivery information of the AF location. In all cases, the requiring activity ensures delivered CAP has an appropriate IUID marking (Reference (g)). Regulations provide no exemption or shortcut from following all GFP regulations and requirements (justification, clauses, attachments, etc.), simply because the property started as CAP.   Section 4. Delivery Not Required. When contractors consume CAP during contract performance or dispose of it via the plant clearance and screening process, the delivery and acceptance requirements do not apply. The same is true for contractor purchases or sales of CAP and approved exchanges (not contractual transfer) of acquired material with contractors via a credit/debit process authorized, but contractually  transparent,  to  the  AF.  In  such  cases,  the  contractor  follows  disposition  instructions contained the contract. The property administrator, Plant Clearance Officer (PLCO) and Administrative   Contracting  Officer  (ACO)  handle  disposition  of  CAP  and  notifies  the  contracting  office  when decisions are required. The decisions made by the AF requiring activities, logistics, and contracting personnel involved in the disposition process may consider CAP items. However, when there is no requirement to deliver the items, there is no need to create a CAP contract line item, populate the APSR, or execute other steps associated with the delivery and acceptance process.

Program Objective. Exchange/sales authority: (See DoD 7000.14-R, Volume 2A, Chapter 1, Para-graph 010210.) 9.1. Permits the Air Force to reduce funding requirements when acquiring replacement personalproperty by applying the exchange allowance or sales proceeds from property being replaced to theacquisition of similar replacement property. 9.2. Enables agencies to avoid the costs associated with holding and processing property through thenormal disposal cycle. 9.3. Enables the Air Force to retain exchange allowances or sales proceeds in lieu of having disposalsales proceeds sent to the miscellaneous receipts account at the U.S. Treasury. 10. General Guidance.  10.1. This section provides procedures for implementing DoD Materiel Management Regulation,DOD 4140.1-R, authority to apply the exchange or sales proceeds from eligible nonexcess items whenacquiring replacement items. 10.2. All exchanges/sales will comply with these procedures, DOD 4140.1-R, Section 6.2. If the AFacquires personal property using both Government personal property and appropriated funds as con-sideration, the acquisition must also comply with DFARS 217.7000. 10.3. Nonexcess personal property may be sold/exchanged only after a determination that the per-sonal property: 10.3.1. Is still needed to perform missions/duties, 10.3.2. Does not adequately perform all of the tasks for which it was procured and used, 10.3.3. Was not originally acquired for the purpose of conducting an exchange, and 10.3.4. Isn’t in a prohibited federal supply class. 10.4. The System Program Director (SPD) for major end items and the managing DoD IntegratedManager/Inventory Control Point (ICP) for secondary items determine whether centrally managed eli-gible nonexcess items qualify for exchange/sale. 10.5. SPDs will coordinate proposed end item exchanges or sales with the ICPs managing installedcomponents/parts. AFI23-119   5 JUNE 2001910.6. Bases, Air Force Reserve, and Air National Guard units may use exchange/sales provisionswhen procuring like replacement items for eligible noncentrally managed items and for centrally man-aged items when prior approval is obtained from the managing ICP. 10.7. All centrally managed items must be reported to the appropriate ICP for disposition determina-tion in accordance with existing supply policy in AFI 23-501. 10.8. Prior to contracting for replacement property, the holding activity will contact Federal Agenciesknown to use or distribute similar property to determine if an agency wants the property by means ofa reimbursable transfer. The price negotiated must not be greater than the best estimate of what wouldhave been received in a sale or exchange. 10.9. Prior to contracting for replacement property, a determination will be made of which method –exchange or sale – will provide the greater return to the Government. This determination will becomepart of the contract file. When estimating the return under each method, all administrative and over-head costs will be considered. If the exchange allowance or estimated sales proceeds for propertywould be unreasonably low, property will be turned in for disposal in accordance with existing supplypolicies. 10.10. Proceeds from exchange/sale of nonexcess materiel may only be used to acquire materiel thatis similar to the materiel exchanged/sold. (See DoD 7000.14-R, Volume 2A, Chapter 1, Paragraph010210.) 10.11. Property acquired must be authorized for an approved program. 10.12. The number of items exchanged/sold must be equal to the number of items acquired unless: 10.12.1.

Section D—Domestic Technology Transfer Programs Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs) 12. Program Objective. The Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 authorized CRADAs as a meansto help improve the way Federal agencies transfer commercially useful technologies to the private sector.This section provides guidance for Air Force activities to provide temporary custody of Air Force prop-erty to CRADA applicants. 13. Authority. CRADAs between laboratories and applicants (collaborators) are authorized by 15 U.S.C.3710a. DoD policy in DoDD 5535.3, May 21, 1999, DoD Domestic Technology Transfer (T2) Program,and procedures in DoDI 5535.8, May 14, 1999, DoD Technology Transfer (T2) Program, provide over-arching guidance for CRADAs. AFI 61-302, July 26, 1994, establishes AF policy and procedures for exe-cuting CRADAs. 14. General Guidance.  AFI23-119   5 JUNE 20011314.1. A military-use CRADA is an agreement between a DoD laboratory and/or technical activityand an industrial partner to utilize existing unique capabilities and facilities at the DoD laboratory in aproduct or process intended primarily for DoD or other military use. A "laboratory" means any facilityor group of facilities that is owned, leased, or otherwise used by DoD and funded by the Government,whether operated by the Government or by a contractor. 14.2. Under a CRADA the laboratory/technical activity may provide personnel, services, facilities,equipment, or other resources with or without reimbursement, but not funds to the non-Federal party. 14.3. The non-Federal party may provide funds, personnel, services, facilities, equipment, and otherresources toward the conduct of specific R&D efforts that are consistent with the missions of the lab-oratory. 14.4. A CRADA, as provided in 15 U.S.C. § 3710(d), is not a procurement contract or a cooperativeagreement as Section 6303 et seq. of Title 31 of the United States Code uses these terms. FAR proce-dures shall not be used in providing materiel to CRADA collaborators. 14.5. The Air Force shall not make monetary payments to the collaborating party under a CRADA. 14.6. Equipment, maintenance or other sustainment support shall not be provided for the laboratoryequipment furnished by the CRADA. 15. Responsibilities:  15.1. The head of the laboratory shall:15.1.1. Determine which laboratory property is suitable and available for temporary and exclu-sive use by a CRADA collaborator.15.1.2. Ensure property is nonexcess, but not for the time needed by DoD, by screening within theDoD laboratory/scientific community to determine whether there are other immediate governmentrequirements for the property. 15.1.3. Ensure proper controls are applied to prevent unauthorized release of property havingenvironmental regulations, U.S. Department of State or Commerce export license restrictions,demilitarization requirements or trade and security control risks. 15.1.4. Ensure property provided by custodial transfer is managed in accordance with proceduresin AFI 61-301. 15.1.5. Ensure leased property is managed in accordance with procedures in AFI 64-103. 15.1.6. Ensure the laboratory retains title/accountability for property provided to collaborators,accomplishes required CFO reporting, and ensures, after termination or expiration of the agree-ment/lease, that property is returned in the condition in which it was provided, normal wear andtear excepted. 15.1.7. Ensure all reporting is accomplished as required by DoDI 5535.8. 15.2. The laboratory supply activity shall: 15.2.1. Use the federal catalog (FED LOG) to obtain item characteristics for stock-listed propertyto identify items requiring controls. 14AFI23-119   5 JUNE 200115.2.2. Obtain item characteristics/controls data from the manufacturer for nonstock-listed prop-erty. 15.2.3. Contact the Defense Logistics Information System (DLIS) Demilitarization Coding Man-agement Office (DCMO), Battle Creek, MI, to obtain assistance identifying security and tradecontrol requirements for property being considered for lease or custodial transfer under aCRADA. 15.2.4. Ensure property is not released to the collaborator until the CRADA document is formal-ized and the laboratory director, or his representative, has authorized release of the property. 15.2.5. Maintain accountable records, accomplish CFO reporting, and inspect the property uponreturn by the collaborator. 15.3. Air Force inventory control points (ICP) will normally not be involved in educational partner-ship property transactions since the property is laboratory-owned and on the laboratory’s accountablerecords. Requests for ICP involvement in CRADA property transactions will be referred to HQAFMC/LGIA. Educational Partnerships 16. Program Objective. The educational partnership is a vehicle whereby Air Force laboratories under-take joint tasks with educational institutions for the purpose of encouraging and enhancing study in scien-tific disciplines of interest to the Air Force. Such partnership agreements provide educational institutionsaccess to laboratory resources (laboratory equipment, personnel, facilities, etc.) and provide a uniqueopportunity for students to work on projects and equipment not otherwise available within the educationalinstitution. This section provides guidance for Air Force activities to authorize the use of Air Force prop-erty in conjunction with an educational partnership agreement. 17. Authority. 10 U.S.C. 2194 authorizes the Secretary of Defense to allow defense laboratories to enterinto one or more educational partnership agreements and to transfer excess laboratory equipment to par-ticipating educational institutions at all levels of education. 15 U.S.C. 3710(i), commonly known as theStevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act, also provides transfer authority for a laboratory, agency,or department to donate excess research equipment to educational institutions and non-profit organiza-tions for technical, scientific education, and research activities. DoD policy in DoDD 5535.3, May 21,1999, DoD Domestic Technology Transfer (T2) Program, and procedures in DoDI 5535.8, May 14, 1999,DoD Technology Transfer (T2) Program, provide overarching guidance for these partnerships. AFI61-301 and AFI 61-302 provide implementing procedures. . 18. General Guidance.  18.1. Property shall be made available to public and private schools and nonprofit educational insti-tutions located in the U.S. by means of a lease, custodial transfer agreement or donation agreement. 18.1.1. Property provided by custodial transfer agreement or lease shall be nonexcess. 18.1.2. If property is surplus, it may be provided by donation in accordance with DoD4160.21-M. 19.
