This  instruction  establishes  requirements  and  grading  criteria  for  ground  and flight phases of initial, requalification and periodic flight evaluations.  Aircrew evaluations will be  conducted  in  accordance  with  (IAW)  this  instruction  and  AFI  11-202V2,  Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation  Program,  as  supplemented.    Specific  areas  for  evaluation  are prescribed  to  ensure  an  accurate  assessment  of  proficiency  and  capabilities  of  aircrews.  (T-1)  Flight  examiners  and  instructors  will  use  this  AFI  while  conducting/preparing  for  aircrew evaluations. 1.1.1.  Due  to  the  diverse  nature  of  UH-1N  units,  all  references  to  MAJCOM,  NAF  or  a particular  MAJCOM  or  NAF  office  are  intended  to  mean  that  office  or  equivalent.  MAJCOM supplements to this AFI will indicate if there is a different office of responsibility. 1.1.2.  For  purposes  of  this  instruction,  the  Air  Force  District  of  Washington  (AFDW)  and Air National Guard (ANG) are considered a MAJCOM. 1.2.  Responsibilities. 1.2.1.  Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC). 1.2.1.1.  Develops  this  instruction  consistent  with  the  USAF  Standardization  and Evaluation  Program  and  unique  requirements,  according  to  AFPD  11-2,  Aircrew Operations.    AFGSC  will  coordinate  operational  procedures,  evaluation  criteria  and guidance published in this instruction with user MAJCOMs. (T-2) 1.2.1.2.  Convene  conferences  and working  groups,  as  necessary to  review  and  improve UH-1N standardization/evaluation procedures. (T-2) 1.2.1.3.  Develops, in coordination with user MAJCOMs, and publishes a UH-1N Master Question File (MQF). (T-2) 1.3.  Evaluators. 1.3.1.  Evaluators must be instructor qualified in a given event prior to acting as an evaluator in the event. (T-2) 1.3.2.  Evaluators  who  subsequently  add  instructor  certified  events  listed  in  AFI  11-2UH-1NV1,  UH-1N  Helicopter  Aircrew  Training,  or  qualifications  are  automatically  certified  to evaluate the new certification(s)/qualification(s). (T-2) 1.4.  Evaluation Procedures. 1.4.1.  Evaluators will use evaluation criteria contained in each crew chapter for conducting all  flight  and  emergency  procedures  evaluations  (EPEs).    To  ensure  standard  and  objective evaluations, evaluators will be thoroughly familiar with the prescribed evaluation criteria. 1.4.2.  Prior  to  the  aircrew  briefing,  the  evaluator  will  brief  the  examinee  on  specific evaluation  areas,  purpose  and  conduct  of  the  evaluation,  and,  if  applicable,  will  inform  the Aircraft  Commander  of  special  requirements.    The  examinee  will  execute/delegate appropriate flight planning/mission preparation duties.  Evaluators will be furnished copies of   6  AFI11-2UH-1NV2  18 MARCH 2015 mission  materials  to  include  necessary  maps  (only  one  map  per  aircraft  is  required),  flight logs, etc. 1.4.3.  Evaluators  will  ensure  all  required  training  and  documentation  is  complete  prior  to conducting an evaluation. (T-3) 1.4.4.  Unless  specified,  the  examinee  or  evaluator  may  fly  in  any  seat  (within  their  crew qualification), to include the cabin, that will best enable the evaluator to conduct a thorough evaluation.    EXCEPTION:  During  pilot  initial  or  requalification  evaluations  a  qualified evaluator will be at a set of controls. (T-2) 1.4.5.  Evaluators will not intentionally fail any equipment during flight evaluations, but may deny  the  use  of  systems  not  affecting  safety  of  flight.  (Exception:  During  evaluations conducted in ATDs, equipment may be failed or disabled.) (T-2) 1.4.6.  Evaluators will use a locally produced AF IMT 3862, Flight Evaluation Worksheet, or equivalent,  while  performing  the  flight  evaluation/emergency  procedure  evaluation  (EPE).  (T-3) 1.4.7.  When  it  is  impossible  or  impractical  to  evaluate  a  required  area  in  flight,  the  Flight Evaluator  (FE)  may  elect  to  evaluate  area(s)  by  an  alternate  method  (simulator,  procedural trainer,  or  verbal  examination  following  guidance  in  para.  1.16.  Verbal  Evaluation  of  Sub-areas). Alternate methods are not authorized for initial evaluations. 1.4.8.  During  an  actual  emergency,  the  evaluator  will  determine  when  to  terminate  an evaluation. 1.4.9.  The evaluator will thoroughly debrief all aspects of the evaluation.  This debrief will include the overall rating, specific deviations, area grades assigned (if other than qualified), and required additional training (if applicable). (T-2) 1.5.  Grading  Instructions.  To  ensure  standard  and  objective  evaluations,  evaluators  will  be thoroughly  familiar  with  the  prescribed  evaluation  criteria.    Evaluator  judgment  will  be  the determining factor in arriving at the overall grade. 1.5.1.  Grading  instructions  and  performance  criteria  are  contained  in  AFI  11-202V2  and crew chapters in this instruction. 1.5.2.  Base  tolerances  for  in-flight  parameters  on  conditions  of  smooth  air  and  a  stable aircraft.    Do  not  consider  momentary  deviations  from  tolerances,  provided  the  examinee applies  prompt  corrective  action  and  such  deviations  do  not  jeopardize  flying  safety  or violate  regulatory  guidance.    The  evaluator  will  consider  cumulative  deviations  when determining the overall grade. 1.5.3.  Areas not applicable to the unit or mission need not be performed; however, all areas performed will be graded. (T-2) 1.5.4.  The  evaluator  will  compare  examinee  performance  for  each  required  area accomplished  during  the  evaluation  with  the  evaluation  criteria  provided  in  each  crew chapter and assign an appropriate grade.  Derive the overall flight evaluation grade from the area grades based on observed events and tasks IAW this publication. 1.5.5.  Evaluator  judgment  will  be  exercised  when  the  wording  of  areas  is  subjective  and when specific situations are not covered. AFI11-2UH-1NV2  18 MARCH 2015   7  1.5.6.  The AF Form 8, Section IV., Examiner’s Remarks, A. Mission Description., will be of sufficient content to verify that the required areas for the evaluation were completed. 1.6.  Critical  Areas.  Critical areas require adequate accomplishment by the aircrew member in order  to  successfully  achieve  the  mission  objectives.    If  an  aircrew  member  receives  an unqualified  grade  in  any  critical  area,  the  overall  grade  for  the  evaluation  will  also  be unqualified. (T-1)  Critical areas are identified by (CRITICAL) in the area title. 1.7.  Evaluations.  Evaluators will conduct flight evaluations as specified in AFI 11-202V2, the specific crew position chapter and associated tables of this volume. (T-2) The evaluator will not conduct  two  consecutive  evaluations  in  the  simulator.  (T-2)  (EXCEPTION:  Instrument (INSTM)  evaluations).  Examinees  must  accomplish  Initial  Qualification  (QUAL),  Initial Mission (INIT MSN) and Requalification  (RQ QUAL  or  RQ MSN) evaluations in the aircraft. (T-2) 1.8.  Ground  Phase  Requisites.  IAW  AFI  11-202V2  and  MAJCOM  supplements,  during  all qualification  evaluations,  crewmembers  are  required  to  complete  a  Qualification  Open  Book examination, Qualification Closed Book examination, EPE and Boldface examination. (T-1) All pilots  must  complete  an  Instrument  examination  during  all  instrument  evaluations.  (T-1)  All crew members must complete a Mission Open Book and EPE during all mission evaluations. (T-1) 1.9.  Examinations.  Conduct  examinations  IAW  AFI  11-202V2  and  MAJCOM  supplements.    (T-1) 1.9.1.  Units  may  generate  a  unique  test  for  each  crew  member  using  appropriate  computer software programs.  The minimum numbers of test questions are: 1.9.1.1.  Qualification  Open  Book  examination  (Qual  Open),  (Pilot  (P)/Flight  Engineer (FE)) — 50 questions. 1.9.1.2.  Qualification Closed Book examination (Qual Closed) (P/FE) — 25 questions. 1.9.1.3.  Mission Open Book examination (Msn Open) (P/FE) — 50 questions. 1.9.1.4.  Instrument Open Book examination (Instrument)(P) — 50 questions. 1.9.1.5.  Flight Surgeon — as required by AFMOA/SG3P. 1.9.2.  Boldface Exam. IAW T.O. 1H-1(U)N-1 and AFI 11-202V2. 1.9.2.1.  Q.  Able  to  recite/write  the  proper  emergency  boldface  actions  in  the  correct sequence with no discrepancies (spelling error is ok as long as intent does not change). 1.9.2.2.  U.  Failed  to  recite/write  emergency  boldface  items  in  the  correct  sequence. Discrepancies in the procedure. 1.10.  Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE).  The purpose of the EPE is to discuss systems knowledge  and  evaluate  emergency  procedures,  allowing  for  an  in-depth  investigation  of systems knowledge and scenario driven circumstances.  An EPE is a requisite for all QUAL and MSN evaluations. (T-1)  This evaluation will include areas commensurate with the examinee’s Ready  Aircrew  Program  (RAP)  training  level.    EPEs  may  be  performed  individually  or  as  a crew, in-flight, in a simulator, verbally, or by another method determined by the examiner or unit   8  AFI11-2UH-1NV2  18 MARCH 2015 standardization/evaluation.    Operations  Group  standardization/evaluation  may  develop  EPE guides for each crew position for flight examiner use. 1.10.1.  EPEs should be scenario driven, tailored to the specific crew position, and emphasize emergency  procedures,  special  interest  items  and  systems  knowledge.    Evaluators  may  use one  continuous  scenario  throughout  the  EPE  or  different  scenarios  for  each  emergency procedure. 1.10.2.  Examinees may use publications that are normally available in flight. The examinee must recall all boldface items from memory IAW AFI 11-202V2. (T-1) 1.10.3.  Include the following items on all EPEs: (T-2) 1.10.3.1.  Aircraft  general  knowledge  including  operation  of  systems,  limitations,  and capabilities. 1.10.3.2.  Crew coordination and risk management. 1.10.3.3.  Mission evaluation scenarios should be tailored to unit tasking and any current special interest items.  The following additional items will be included on the EPE given as a requisite to the mission evaluation: (T-2) 1.10.3.3.1.  Mission equipment malfunctions and emergencies. 1.10.3.3.2.  Evasive action/threat reaction/degradation, as applicable to unit mission. 1.10.4.  The following additional items will be included on pilot EPEs given as a requisite for the QUAL/INSTM combined evaluation. (T-2) 1.10.4.1.  Procedures and publications required to proceed to alternate/divert airfields. 1.10.4.2.  Unusual attitude recoveries.  This also fulfills the Area 31 (Unusual Attitudes) requirement if accomplished in a simulator. 1.10.5.  The evaluator will assign an overall grade (1, 2, or 3) for the EPE in the Qualification Ground Phase Block of the AF Form 8 IAW the qualification levels in paragraphs 1.10.5.1. – 1.10.5.3. (T-1) 1.10.5.1.  (1)  Satisfactory  systems/procedural  knowledge.  Operated  within  prescribed limits  and  correctly  diagnosed  problems.  Performed  and/or  explained  proper  corrective action, in the proper sequence, for each type of malfunction. Accomplished all required checklists and/or effectively used available aids. Thoroughly described the location, use and limitations of emergency equipment. 1.10.5.2.  (2)  Marginal  systems/procedural  knowledge.  Slow  to  analyze  problems  or apply  proper  corrective  actions.  Did  not  effectively  use  checklist  and/or  available  aids. Minor  omissions  or  deviations  in  describing  the  location,  use  and  limitations  of emergency equipment. 1.10.5.3.  (3)  Unsatisfactory  systems/procedural  knowledge.  Failed  to  analyze  problem or take corrective action. Failed to accomplish required checklists and/or unable to locate information  in  available  aids.  Major  omissions  or  deviations  in  describing  the  location, use and limitations of emergency equipment. AFI11-2UH-1NV2  18 MARCH 2015   9  1.11.  Publications  Check.  Units may specify additional publications to be evaluated in  a unit supplement.  The personal copies of flight publications that are issued (electronic or paper copy) by MAJCOMS that will be checked for currency and proper posting are: (T-2) 1.11.1.  T.O. 1H-1(U)N-1, UH-1N Flight Manual (All) 1.11.2.  T.O. 1H-1(U)N-1 CL-1, Pilot’s Flight Crew Checklist (All) 1.11.3.  T.O. 1H-1(U)N-1 CL-2, Crewmember’s Flight Crew Checklist (All, if applicable to unit assigned mission equipment) 1.11.4.  T.O. 1H-1(U)N-5, Basic Weight Checklist and Loading Data (FE) 1.11.5.  AFI 11-2UH-1NV3, UH-1N Helicopter Operations Procedures (All) 1.11.6.  AFI  11-2UH-1NV3  CL-1,  UH-1N  Helicopter  Crew  Briefing  Guides  and  Checklists (All) 1.11.7.  AFI 11-202V3, General Flight Rules (All) 1.11.8.  AFMAN 11-217V1, Instrument Flight Procedures (Pilot) 1.11.9.  Local in-flight guide/SOPs (All, if applicable) 1.11.10.  AFMAN 11-217V2, Visual Flight Procedures (Pilot) 1.12.  Cockpit/Crew  Resource  Management  (CRM).  In  accordance  with  AFI  11-290, Cockpit/Crew Resource Management Training  Program, crew resource management skills will be evaluated during initial and periodic evaluations. (T-1) CRM skills are integral to all phases of flight;  therefore,  no  specific  area  titled  CRM  exists.    CRM  skills  are  imbedded  within  specific grading  criteria  (mission  planning,  airmanship/situational  awareness,  crew  coordination, communication,  risk  management/decision  making,  task  management,  and  briefing/debriefing) and include all of the skills listed on the AF IMT 4031, CRM Skills Criteria Training/ Evaluation Form.  Therefore, use of the AF IMT 4031 is unnecessary for evaluations. 1.13.  Formal  Course  Evaluations.  Conduct  evaluations  IAW  syllabus  mission  profile guidelines, or on a mission profile developed from syllabus training objectives.  Formal course guidelines  may  be  modified  based  on  local  operating  considerations  or  evaluator  judgment.  Grade training objectives and related areas using the performance criteria in this volume. (T-3) 1.14.  Mission  Evaluations.  Mission evaluations will normally be flown using unit formations and tactics.  Examinees will be evaluated in the position of their highest qualification.  If briefed, at  the  evaluator’s  discretion,  portions  may  be  flown  in  another  position,  but  the  emphasis  is  to have examinees evaluated at their highest qualification level. (T-2) 1.14.1.  Evaluations  during  exercises  or  non-contingency  deployments  are  encouraged.  Evaluations  during  contingencies  are  authorized  with  the  concurrence  of  OG/CC  or equivalent. (T-3) 1.14.2.  CMR aircrew should accomplish their periodic mission evaluation during the unit’s most demanding sortie (i.e. Night Vision Goggles (NVG) tactical, NVG Formation/Tactical, etc.). At a minimum, aircrews will be evaluated on NVG mission events every other mission evaluation cycle. (T-2)   10  AFI11-2UH-1NV2  18 MARCH 2015 1.14.3.  For CMR aircrew to complete an evaluation, all areas in the crew event tables (Table 2.1, Table 3.1, and Table 4.1), annotated with an “R” must be accomplished.  BMC aircrew will only be evaluated on those missions routinely performed and in those areas which they are qualified to perform unsupervised.  Only those areas the examinee is qualified/certified to perform or areas gaining requalification in will be evaluated. (T-2) 1.14.4.  Evaluation profiles will be based on Designed Operational Capability (DOC) tasking, training sorties, and operational missions normally flown by the unit. (T-1) 1.14.5.  All  aircrew  will  complete  a  mission  evaluation  prior  to  being  designated  as  BMC. (T-2) 1.14.6.  Difference  Qualification.  Upon  successful  completion  of  the  Qualification  (QUAL) and  Instrument  (INSTM)  flight  evaluations,  existing  Mission  (MSN)  qualifications  and certifications (except FCF and evaluator certification) transfer between H-1 series aircraft (or as specified by MAJCOM supplement). 1.15.  SPOT  Evaluations.  Any  flight  examiner  may  administer  an  aircrew  SPOT  evaluation. Instructional  ability  should  be  evaluated  during  the  SPOT  evaluation  (if  applicable).  If  the examiner  is  administering  a  SPOT  evaluation  to  a  person  in  another  aircrew  specialty,  only boldface,  safety/judgment,  aircrew  discipline,  and  airmanship/situational  awareness  will  be evaluated. (T-2) 1.16.  Verbal Evaluation of Sub-areas. 1.16.1.  For initial evaluations, all required items must be performed by actual demonstration.  (T-2) 1.16.2.  During  requalification/periodic/recurring  evaluations,  when  it  is  impossible  or impractical  to  evaluate  a  required  area  in-flight,  the  evaluator  may  elect  to  evaluate  the area(s)  by  an  alternate  method  (simulator,  procedural  trainer,  or  verbal  examination).  Document  why  required  area(s)  were  not  evaluated  in-flight  and  the  alternate  method  of evaluation used in the additional comments paragraph of the examiner’s remarks section of the AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification. (T-2)  If, in the evaluator’s judgment, a required  item  cannot  be  adequately  evaluated  by  an  alternate  method,  complete  the evaluation on an additional flight. 1.17.  Unsatisfactory Performance. 1.17.1.  If  a  flight  examiner  observes  an  aircrew  member  jeopardizing  safety,  the  examiner will assume the duties of that  aircrew  member if in  like crew position. (T-1)   If not  in  like crew position, the flight may continue if crew compliment allows.  This does  not  mean  the examiner  must  assume  the  examinee’s  position  any  time  unsatisfactory  performance  is observed. 1.17.1.1.  If  the  examiner  feels  the  examinee  can  continue  safely  with  supervision,  the examiner  is  not  required  to  assume  the  examinee’s  duties.    However,  if  the  flight examiner  assumes  the  examinee’s  duties,  assign  a  Qualification  Level  3  (Q-3)  as  the overall grade. (T-2) 1.17.2.  Evaluators  must  report  unsatisfactory  deviations/discrepancies  from  established procedures/directives  in  any  area,  regardless  of  the  individual’s  crew  specialty,  to  the AFI11-2UH-1NV2  18 MARCH 2015   11  squadron  commander,  operations  officer  and/or  group  commander,  along  with  evaluator’s recommendation for corrective action, IAW AFI 11-202V2 and MAJCOM supplement.

Flight examiner objectivity evaluations are SPOT evaluations used by any flight examiners to observe a flight evaluation and evaluate the objectivity and performance of a lower echelon flight examiner. The examinee must demonstrate the ability to perform evaluations in a safe and effective manner. (T-2) 5.2.  Requirements.  Any  flight  examiner  may  administer  aircrew  flight  examiner  objectivity evaluations.  Evaluators  will  evaluate  flight  examiners  (all  crew  positions)  on  areas  listed  in Table 5.1. (T-2) Evaluators will only use Q-1 or Q-3 qualification levels. (T-2) Award a Q-3 if a grade  of  U  is  awarded  in  any  area.  Consider  cumulative  Q-  deviations  when  determining  the qualification level. The OG/CC will determine the future status of any flight examiner receiving a Q-3. (T-3) Units will not use flight examiner objectivity evaluations to fulfill the requirements of  periodic  evaluations.  (T-2)  Evaluators  will  document  flight  examiner  objectivity  evaluations on the AF Form 8. (T-2) 5.2.1.  An evaluator receiving an unqualified rating will not sign the AF Form 8 for the direct evaluation examinee.  If the higher echelon evaluator is the same crew position as the direct evaluation  examinee,  the  higher  echelon  evaluator  will  sign  both  the  lower  echelon evaluator’s and the direct examinee’s AF Form 8 as the Flight Examiner.  If the examiner is administering  an  evaluation  to  a  person  in  another  aircrew  specialty,  the  direct  examinee’s evaluation will be terminated. 5.2.1.1.  If the direct examinee was receiving a recurring evaluation (QUAL, INSTM or MSN),  the  higher  echelon  evaluator  is  responsible  for  ensuring  all  requisites  and  items are  completed  for  the  evaluation,  or  the  evaluation  will  be recorded  as a  SPOT  and  not count for the 17-month recurring evaluation requirement. 5.2.2.  If  an  examinee  assigns  an  incorrect  area  grade  or  assigns  an  incorrect  qualification level, the flight examiner administering the flight examiner objectivity evaluation will assign the  appropriate  area  grade  or  qualification  level  and  complete  the  documentation  for  the evaluation being administered by the examinee.

Emergency  Procedures  Evaluation  (EPE)—A  flight,  aircrew  training  device  or  verbal evaluation used to evaluate emergency procedures and systems knowledge. Evaluation Profile—Defines the required items of an evaluation to include a scenario. Deviation—Performing  an  action  not  in  sequence  with  current  procedures,  directives,  or regulations.  Performing action(s) out of sequence due to unusual or extenuating circumstances is not considered a deviation.  In some cases, momentary deviations may be acceptable; however, cumulative  momentary  deviations  will  be  considered  in  determining  the  overall  qualification level. Error—Departure from standard procedures.  Performing  wrong actions or recording incorrect information. Initial  Evaluation—The first evaluation of any type for a crew position in an MDS (i.e., INIT QUAL/INSTM, INIT MSN, INIT INSTR). MSN Evaluation—Qualifies an individual to perform the unit’s operational mission. Minor—Did  not  detract  from  mission  accomplishment,  adversely  affect  use  of  equipment,  or violate safety. Q—The desired level of performance.  The examinee demonstrated a satisfactory knowledge of all  required  information,  performed  aircrew  duties  within  the  prescribed  tolerances,  and accomplished the assigned mission. Q-—The  examinee  is  qualified  to  perform  the  assigned  area/subarea  tasks,  but  requires debriefing  or  additional  training  as  determined  by  the  flight  examiner.    Deviations  from established standards must not exceed the prescribed Q- tolerances or jeopardize safety of flight. U— A breach of flight discipline, performance outside allowable parameters, or deviations from prescribed  procedures/tolerances that  adversely  affected  mission  accomplishment  or compromised flight safety.  An examinee receiving an area/subarea grade of U normally requires additional training.
