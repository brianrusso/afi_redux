SUMMARY OF CHANGES This is a new instruction that consolidates guidance and supersedes AFI 14-2CR, Volumes 1-3, and updates policies and procedures for intelligence support to CR operations.  The Mobility Air Forces Intelligence Formal Training Unit attendance policy is clarified.  MQT Knowledge tests are  not  mandatory  during  training  but  remain  an  evaluation  requirement.    The  Advanced  Air Mobility  Intelligence  Course  is  no  longer  an  intelligence  evaluator  requisite,  but  units  are  still required  to  send  some  personnel  to  the  course.    Continuation  Training  requirements  have expanded to clearly define CT and annual training topics.  Chapter 1— OVERVIEW  1.1.

Initial  Qualification  Training  (IQT)  Formal  Course.  IQT  consists  of  multiple  courses including:  the AMC Mobility Air Forces (MAF) Intelligence Formal Training Unit (IFTU), the AF  Force  Protection  (FP)  IFTU,  Anti-Terrorism/Force  Protection  Level  II  (AT/L2)  and Contingency  Response  Mission  Orientation  Course  (CR-MOC).    When  possible,  IFTU attendance should occur prior to reporting to the duty station or as soon as possible after arrival at  the  duty  station.    When  a  seat  in  IFTU  is  not  readily  available,  the  unit  should  begin  MQT prior to IFTU attendance. 3.1.1.  MAF  IFTU [USAF Education and Training Course Announcements (ETCA) Course ID:  AMC MAF IFTU].  In-residence attendance is mandatory for all intelligence personnel at  their  first  mobility  assignment.    Personnel  who  have  attended  AMC  MAF  IFTU  in  a previous mobility assignment will repeat the IFTU if the break between mobility assignments is more than five years (T-1). 3.1.2.  FP  IFTU  [ETCA  Course  ID:    AF  FP  IFTU].    In-residence  FP  IFTU  attendance  is mandatory  for  all  intelligence  personnel  at  their  first  CR  assignment.    Personnel  who  have attended  FP  IFTU  in  a  previous  assignment  will  repeat  FPIFTU  if  the  break  between  CR assignments is more than four years.  When possible, FP IFTU attendance should occur prior to  reporting  to  the  duty  station  or  as  soon  as  possible  after  arrival  at  the  duty  station.  Individuals only need to attend the FP IFTU once during consecutive CR assignments. 3.1.3.  AT/L2 [ETCA Course ID:  ACC ATFPLV2].  Certification guidance is managed IAW AFI 10-245, Antiterrorism (AT). 3.1.4.  Prerequisites are noted in ETCA IAW the formal course syllabus. 3.2.  IQT Timelines. 3.2.1.  Personnel in full-time status (RegAF, ART, AGR, IMA on active orders) who attend IFTU after arriving at duty station must complete IFTU within 120 days.  Personnel not on full-time  status  (traditional  reservist/guardsman/IMA)  have  180  days  to  complete  IFTU.  Units unable to meet this timeline require a waiver from AMC/A2. 3.2.2.  Waiver.  The waiver request includes the reason the CWI was not able to obtain a seat within  the  timeline,  the  actions  taken  to  obtain  the  seat,  and  the  individual’s  scheduled attendance  date  (see  example  in  Attachment  3).    AMC  units  will  route  waiver  requests directly to AMC/A2 Force Management Division; non-AMC units will route waiver requests through their MAJCOM for endorsement before forwarding to AMC/A2 Force Management Division (T-2). 3.3.  IFTU Course Development and Maintenance.  The MAF IFTU develops and maintain its courseware and materials IAW the Instructional System Design (ISD) process.  The formalized course  content  is  published  via  the  ISD  Report  which  includes  the  course  syllabus,  course training standard and course resource estimate.  This report is available for MAJCOM and unit review. AFI14-2CR  6 SEPTEMBER 2016 11 3.4.  IQT  Completion.  Individuals  are  provided  a  completed  AF  Form  4350,  upon  IFTU graduation.  CWIs will ensure documentation in the individual’s qualification training record (T-2).  Personnel are considered Basic Qualified (BQ) upon completion of all IQT course requisites. 12 AFI14-2CR  6 SEPTEMBER 2016 Chapter 4 MISSION QUALIFICATION 4.1.  Timeline.  All  MAF  personnel  will  be  Basic  Mission  Capable  (BMC)  or  Combat  Mission Ready  (CMR)  by  the  180th  day  of  assignment  to  their  unit  (T-2).    If  mission  qualification exceeds 180 days, units will route the training shortfall report (see Attachment 3) through their MAJCOM channels to AMC/A2 (T-2). 4.2.  MQT  Program  Structure.  MQT  applies  specific  unit  and  mission  context  to  those skills/knowledge  gained  in  IQT.    Units  may  further  tailor  their  programs  for  intelligence personnel  with  current  qualifications,  prior  experience,  currency,  documented  performance  or formal training.  SIOs may use applicable portions of MQT to create a re-qualification program for  personnel  who  have  regressed  from  CMR  or  BMC  to  specifically  address  deficiencies  that caused regression. 4.2.1.  Intelligence personnel must complete IQT before concluding MQT, but subject areas may be trained concurrently IAW AFI 14-202 when logical (T-2). 4.2.2.  Personnel  in  MQT  may  participate  in  exercises  and  perform  intelligence  functions while supervised by a current and qualified individual. 4.2.3.  Personnel  may  complete  other  local  area  orientation  and  training  while  completing MQT. 4.3.  Knowledge  and  Task  Training.  Develop  unit blocks of instruction from lead command-provided  and/or  unit-developed  training  materials  to  include  unique  local  area  procedures relevant  to  the  tasks  and  areas  pertinent  to  the  mission.    At  a  minimum,  MQT  programs  will include: (T-2) 4.3.1.  Knowledge MQT. 4.3.1.1.  Threat  Training.

RIP tasks are addressed under qualification currency. 36 AFI14-2CR  6 SEPTEMBER 2016 Chapter 7 STANDARDIZATION/EVALUATION PROGRAM 7.1.  Evaluation Procedures. 7.1.1.  Prior  to  any  formal  evaluation  conducted  by  a  qualified  IE,  the  examinee  must  have completed  all  Mission  Qualification  Training  or  Specialized  Training  requirements,  as outlined in this instruction (T-2). 7.1.2.  Evaluators will give the examinee no less than four hours’ notice of the subject matter or briefing topic for the evaluation (T-2). 7.1.3.  Prior to beginning the evaluation, the IE briefs the examinee on how the evaluation is to  be  conducted,  requirements  and  applicable  criteria.    The  examinee  will  accomplish required planning IAW the duty position being evaluated and provide the IE with a copy of necessary data or materials (T-2). 7.1.4.  IAW  AFI  14-202  Volume  2,  evaluations  should  be  performed  in  a  realistic environment  (real  world  contingencies  may  provide  a  unique  opportunity  to  conduct  an evaluation;  however,  factors  beyond  the  control  of  the  examinee  and  IE  may  preclude  its successful  completion.).    When  evaluation  in  a  realistic  environment  is  not  possible, examinations  may  be  conducted  via  an  alternate  method  (i.e.,  ,  simulated,  staged,  or  by verbal examination) in order to complete the evaluation.  Document the reasons and type of alternate method used in the Comments section of the AF Form 4350 (T-2). 7.1.5.  The IE will thoroughly debrief all aspects of the evaluation to include:  the examinee’s overall  rating,  specific  deviations,  area  grades  assigned  (if  other  than  qualified)  and  any required additional training (T-2). 7.2.  Grading  Instructions.  IEs  will  conduct  the  evaluation  to  include  the  requisite  events  as listed in Tables 4.12 and 5.5, addressing the gradesheet elements and associated grading criteria included  in  Chapters  4  and  5  (T-1).    IEs  are  expected  to  use  their  personal  experience  and knowledge in the assessment of examinee performance and determination of overall grade. 7.2.1.  Each  of  the  main  numbered  elements  on  the  gradesheet  is  expected  to  receive  an individual grade of 1-3 (per the AF4381 instructions).  Sub-elements  are not  required to  be graded individually, but  are integral to the completion of the numbered element and should be considered in the grading. 7.2.2.  Individual  element  grades  are  considered  in  the  aggregate  to  determine  the  overall grade for the event (Q, Q-, U). 7.2.3.  Event  grades  are  compiled  to  determine  the  overall  qualification  level  (Q1,  Q2,  Q3) earned from the evaluation. 7.3.  Additional  Training.  IEs  are  responsible  for  recommending  additional  training  as necessary. 7.4.  Unsatisfactory Performance.  Examinees receiving an overall unqualified grade (Q-3) are be  placed  in  supervised  status  until  recommended  additional  training  is  completed  and/or  a reevaluation  is  successfully  accomplished.    If  an  examinee  receives  a  Q-3  on  a  mission AFI14-2CR  6 SEPTEMBER 2016 37 evaluation,  he/she  may  not  perform  mission  duties  or  specialized  duties  unsupervised  until remedial  actions are accomplished.  If an examinee receives a Q-3 on a specialized evaluation, he/she  may  not  perform  specialized  duties  until  remedial  actions  are  accomplished,  but  he/she may perform mission duties unless specifically restricted. 7.5.  Intelligence Mission Qualification Evaluation. 7.5.1.  Knowledge  Evaluation.    Knowledge  evaluations  are  conducted  as  part  of  the  initial and periodic mission qualification evaluations to evaluate the examinee’s proficiency in CR threat knowledge, VR, PR and FP academics.  For mission qualification evaluations (initial and periodic), examinees will complete a knowledge test from the unit’s master question file that  covers:    CR  threat  knowledge,  PR,  and  intelligence  support  to  ground  forces  (T-2).  Examinees will take a separate visual recognition test (T-2).  Knowledge examinations may also be required during specialized qualification evaluations. 7.5.2.  Task  Evaluation.    Assemble  evaluation  materials  using  current  intelligence,  unit tasking  and  AOR  scenarios  that  incorporate  all  appropriate  evaluation  requirements.    RAD involves  knowledge  intelligence  personnel  should  be  applying  throughout  all  areas  of  the evaluation  and  are  evaluated  as  subsets  of  each  applicable  graded  area  as  indicated  on individual  gradesheets.    The  following  guidelines  are  provided  to  assist  in  constructing evaluation materials: 7.5.2.1.  Manual Order of Battle.  The number of coordinates in the OB plotting exercise should be of sufficient volume to be challenging, yet not so overwhelming that the time taken is beyond that necessary to determine proficiency.  Examinee should have a variety of  threats/items  to  plot  to  ensure  correct  symbology  is  used.    The  exercise  will  include both  geocoords  and  MGRS  coordinates  (T-2).    The  scenario  may  include  erroneous information  to  mirror  the  fog  of  war  by  including  intentionally  incorrect  coordinates  or types of threats for that particular AOR, thereby allowing the IE to assess the examinee’s ability to identify errors and question the validity of information. 7.5.2.2.  Automated  OB.    Examinee  should  be  provided  with  a  variety  of  OB  sources from which to pull data.  Evaluate the examinee’s ability to develop and save threat files, insert accurate data, load, update and purge data to ensure quality control of the displayed data  and  question  the  information’s  accuracy  for  a  particular  AOR.    Ensure  the opportunity exists for the examinee to be evaluated on his or her ability to manipulate OB displays  and  print  using  the  intelligence  support  systems  available.    Evaluate  the examinee’s  ability to  convert  coordinates  between  geocoords  and  MGRS  and DD/MM/SS to DD/MM.mm. 7.5.2.3.  Intelligence  Briefings.    Briefings  should  be  assembled  from  information provided  by  the  evaluator;  message  traffic,  intelligence  reports,  imagery,  and  other sources  that  are  used  to  evaluate  other  mission  areas  may  be  used  to  fulfill  this requirement.
