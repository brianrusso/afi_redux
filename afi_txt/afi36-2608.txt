War  and  Mobilization  Military  Personnel  Records  System  Procedures.  During contingency or emergency conditions, certain procedures are implemented to ensure integrity of the  military  personnel  records  system  and  to  streamline  procedures  to  meet  mission requirements. 2.22.1.  Record custodians will develop local procedures to destroy the Command Records in their custody IAW AF Records Disposition Schedule in AFRIMS if security of the records is jeopardized and it is not feasible to relocate them. (T-3)  If it becomes necessary to destroy or relocate the records, notify AFPC/DPSIRP as soon as possible. 2.22.2.  If eUPRGs are destroyed IAW AF Records Disposition Schedule, in AFRIMS or are otherwise  unavailable,  and  the  situation  allows  for  maintenance  of  eUPRGs  to  resume, establish an Emergency Personnel Record to record significant personnel actions as follows: 2.22.2.1.  On whatever type of folder available, type or print the person's last name, first name, middle initial, and SSN. 2.22.2.2.  Place  an  Emergency  Military  Personnel  Record  (figure  A4.1)  in  the  folder.  This form should contain the Airman's name, grade, SSN, present address, home phone number, PAFSC, date prepared and by whom. 2.22.2.3.  Record only personnel actions that do not have source documents available for placement in the Emergency Personnel Record under Personnel Actions. 2.22.2.4.  When  feasible,  prepare  and  maintain  personnel  actions  on  micro  or  mini computers to make records easier to manage, store, or transfer. Safeguard micro or mini AFI36-2608  26 OCTOBER 2015   17  computers  (laptops)  used  to  transfer  or  store  personal  data  to  avoid  loss/theft  and  PII compromise. 2.22.2.5.  Maintain until the situation allows for reconstruction of the UPRG and normal maintenance resumes. 2.22.3.  Record  and  data  review  programs  are  not  considered  essential  during  these conditions.  The MPS Chief or ANG Director of Personnel determines when to suspend these programs.  Reinstate them when conditions cease. 2.22.4.  The Emergency Action Book contains specific guidance on the above procedure.   18  AFI36-2608  26 OCTOBER 2015 Chapter 3 HANDLING COMMANDER’S OR SUPERVISOR’S ASSIGNED PERSONNEL 3.1.  General  Information.  These  files  are  maintained  and  kept  under  authority  of  Title  10, U.S.C., Section 8013.  The discretion for the PIF is solely up to the unit commander for creation and maintenance.  Set up PIF using the AF Form 10A.  Keep the PIF current, correct in content, and safeguarded to ensure the PIF is not misused or that unauthorized access occurs. 3.2.  Record  Content.  Effective 1 February 1996, PIFs are mandatory for officers who receive Letters  of  Admonishment  or  Letters  of  Counseling  which  are  not  filed  in  their  Unfavorable Information File (UIF).  In determining  what, if any, changes to make regarding what to file or not  to  file,  such  as  routine  correspondence  maintained  elsewhere  in  a  PIF,  commanders  are strongly encouraged to seek the advice of their servicing Staff Judge Advocate (SJA) in order to preserve  their  critical  command  options  in  military  justice  (disciplinary)  and  administrative quality  force  actions.    Enlisted  Performance  Reports/Officer  Performance  Reports  cannot be maintained in the PIF. 3.3.  Record Storage.  Keep records in a locked area or container, except when being used. 3.4.  Record  Access.  The  member  may  gain  access  to  their  PIF  at  any  time  per  AFI  33-332.  The  PIF  contents  must  be  available  for  commanders,  raters,  first  sergeants,  senior  raters,  OSI, and Staff Judge Advocate personnel as warranted.  The release and review of the PIF contents in these instances are for “Official Business” or “routine use” in accordance with AFI 33-332. 3.5.  Retaining and Disposing.  Guidance provided in IAW AF Records Disposition Schedule in AFRIMS. AFI36-2608  26 OCTOBER 2015   19  Chapter 4 RECORDING AND CHANGING BASIC IDENTIFYING DATA 4.1.  General Information.  The SSN serves as the numerical identifier for all Air Force military personnel.    The  Defense  Finance  Accounting  Service  (DFAS)  also  uses  it  for  reporting contributions  withheld  from  Airmen  under  the  Federal  Insurance  Contributions  Act  (FICA).  Executive  Order  9397  and  Executive  Order  13478,  November  22,  l943,  and  Executive  Order 13478, November 20, 2008 requires disclosure of one’s SSN to enter the Air Force.  Applicants for  appointment  or  enlistment  in  the  Air  Force  require  SSN  cards.    The  SSN  is  entered  on  all records requiring a numerical identifier: 4.1.1.  For input into the MilPDS, enter it as an eleven character number, with a hyphen after the third and fifth digits; for example, 123-45-6789. 4.2.  Replacing the SSN Card.  The MPS/FSS Customer Service element assists the member in filling out all items on SS Form 5, Application for a Social Security Card. 4.3.  Resolving  SSN  Discrepancies.  If  the  number  on  an  Airman’s  SSN  card  is  incorrect,  the MPS/FSS Customer Service element follows the directions in Table A7.1 to resolve the issue. 4.4.  Recording  and  Changing  Name  in  Official  Records.  Air  Force  military  personnel records  use  the  name  shown  on  a  birth,  baptismal,  marriage,  or  naturalization  certificate,  civil court order, or other legal document. 4.4.1.  The  name  that  appears  on  the  appointment  memorandum  or  DD  Form  4/1  and  DD Form 4/2, is the official name in Air Force files until changed under this instruction. 4.4.2.  Record the name in order of last name, first name, middle initial or middle name, and any  designation,  such  as  “Junior,  Senior”  or  a  numerical  designator.    Exceptions  are documents whose governing directives require the full name. 4.4.2.1.  Example:  Stephen Maxwell Smith is normally recorded as “Smith, Stephen M.”  At his request, however, record the name as “Smith, Stephen Maxwell. 4.4.2.2.  Abbreviate designations such as “Jr.” for “Junior.” 4.4.3.  When entering the name into MilPDS, do not include hyphens, apostrophes, or spaces between  sections  of  a  compound  name.    The  name  “David  E.  O’Brien,”  for  example,  is reflected  in  the  MiLPDS  as  OBRIEN,  DAVID  E.” “SANTAANA TERESA M”; “Lee Halsey-Jones” is "HALSEYJONES LEE.”   “Teresa  M.  Santa  Ana”  is                                         4.4.4.  Names  typed  or  written  on  forms  and  documents  are  written  to  reflect  any  hyphens, apostrophes,  or  space  in  the  Airman’s  name.

The  MHRRs  contain  personal  information  and  may  only  be  disclosed  to authorized  persons  conducting  official  Air  Force  business.    Authority  to  obtain  copies  of, information from, or possess MHRRs is limited to those persons with an official requirement for the information.  Rank, position, or title alone does not authorize access to personal information about  others.    ARMS  is  the  final  approval/disapproval  authority  for  access.    Routine  access offices  are  shown  in  Table  A8.1.    Other  DoD  offices  may  be  permitted  access  as  approved  by ARMS. 6.1.1.  Users  have  the  responsibility  to  provide  adequate  justification  for  receipt  of  records and  should  show  a  valid  need  to  review  or  obtain  information  from  them  in  the  course  of official duties. 6.2.

Destruction is outlined in AFI 33-364.  The ARPC Form 291, Record Transmittal, is kept attached to MHRRs returned to AFPC and ARPC, respectively. 6.3.  Penalties for Misuse of MHRRs.  Under the Privacy Act of 1974, persons who knowingly and willfully disclose personal information from an Air Force record, regardless of media, to a person  or  agency  not  entitled  to  receive  it,  without  the  advance  consent  of  the  subject  of  the record,  are  subject  to  a  fine.    Under  Title  44,  U.S.C.,  Section  2107,  persons  who  willfully  and unlawfully  conceal,  remove,  mutilate,  obliterate,  or  destroy  Air  Force  records  are  subject  to dismissal and disqualification from further Federal service in addition to a fine, imprisonment, or both.  Unauthorized disclosure of “For Official Use Only” information may result in disciplinary action. 6.4.  How  to  Establish  Routine  Access  to  MHRRs,  or  predessor  files.  All  activities  or persons,  not  listed  in  table  A8.1,  requiring  routine  access  to  the  MHRRs  maintained  at  AFPC submit a memorandum request to AFPC/DPSIRP, 550 C Street West, Suite 19, Randolph AFB, TX  78150-4721.    Include  the  following  information  in  the  request:  justification  for  access  and requester’s name, SSN, grade, office symbol and duty phone number.   6.4.1.  Requests for access to MHRRs maintained at the National Personnel Records Center (NPRC),  St  Louis,  Missouri,  by  any  activity  not  listed  in  table  A8.1  require  approval  by AFPC/DPSIRP.

Memorandum requests require annual revalidation.   Note:   AFPC offices requesting Regular Air Force MHRRs need only revalidate request when their office symbols change. 6.5.  How to Request MHRRs. 6.5.1.  AFPC  and  ARPC  users  should  use  the  Automated  Records  Management  System (ARMS) on-line request system. 6.5.2.  All others see table A8.2. AFI36-2608  26 OCTOBER 2015   25  Chapter 7 ARTICLE 15, RECORD OF NONJUDICIAL PUNISHMENT, PROCEDURES 7.1.  Article 15 and  Promotion   Procedures.  A commander imposing nonjudicial punishment (NJP) under Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice decides whether to file the NJP in  the  OSR  or  NSR  for  officers  and  applicable  enlisted  members.  NJP,  and  selection  record decision based on the NJP, are recorded on an  AF Form 3070B for NCOs meeting a promotion selection board and on AF Form 3070C for officers.  The commander's determination regarding the OSR also applies to filing the NJP in the OCSRGp. 7.1.1.  Who Makes the NJP Filing Decision. 7.1.1.1.  If  an  NJP  for  a  senior  NCO  results  in  a  reduction  to  a  grade  below  master sergeant, the commander makes a filing determination because the NJP was received as a senior NCO. 7.1.1.2.  In  a  joint  command,  if  a  commander  from  a  different  Service  imposes nonjudicial  punishment  on  a  member  of  the  Air  Force  element,  the  senior  Air  Force officer  or  commander  of  the  element  decides  whether  to  file  an  NJP  in  the  selection record,  provided  that  official  is  senior  to  the  commander  imposing  the  nonjudicial punishment. 7.1.1.2.1.  If the senior Air Force officer or commander of the element is unavailable, or is not senior to the commander imposing the nonjudicial punishment, the general court-martial  convening  authority  (GCMCA)  of  the  Air  Force  host  command  (see AFI  25-201,  Support  Agreements  Procedures)  that  is  senior  to  the  commander imposing nonjudicial punishment makes the filing decision.  If there is not a GCMCA in  the  Air  Force  host  command  senior  to  the  commander  imposing  punishment,  a GCMCA of the host service, who is senior to the commander imposing punishment, makes the filing decision. 7.2.  When a Senior Commander’s Review is Necessary. 7.2.1.  The decision to file the NJP in the appropriate selection record is subject to review by the  next  senior  Air  Force  commander  to  the  commander  imposing  the  NJP.    There  are  two exceptions to this rule: 7.2.1.1.  If the commander imposing NJP punishment exercises GCMCA or is a superior of  the  officer  who  exercises  GCMCA,  the  decision  to  file  in  the  appropriate  selection record is not subject to review. 7.2.1.2.  In a joint command if an officer other than the senior Air Force officer assigned (host command or service GCMCA as described above) makes the decision, the decision to file is not subject to review. 7.2.2.  The review authority may either concur or nonconcur with the commander imposing the  NJP  and  this  decision  is  final.      Note:    References  to  "commander"  or  "commander imposing the NJP" include the decision authority described above in joint commands where a commander of a different service imposes the nonjudicial punishment.   26  AFI36-2608  26 OCTOBER 2015 7.2.3.  If the review authority decides not to file the NJP in the selection record, the review authority completes block 10 and returns the NJP to the commander imposing punishment. 7.2.4.  If  the  review  authority  agrees  to  file  the  NJP  in  the  selection  record,  the  review authority  completes  block  10  of  the  NJP  (AF  Form  3070)  and  returns  it  with  related correspondence to the commander imposing punishment. 7.3.  Who Conducts the Senior Commander Review. 7.3.1.  The  Deputy  Chief  of  Staff  (DCS)  or  comparable  level  organizational  head  performs the review for Airmen assigned to the Air Staff. 7.3.2.  The  senior  Air  Force  officer  assigned  performs  the  review  for  Airmen  assigned  to commands, activities, or agencies outside the Department of the Air Force. 7.3.2.1.  If the NJP recipient is the only Air Force member assigned (or is the senior Air Force  officer  assigned),  the  office  of  primary  responsibility  (OPR)  in  HQ  USAF  or MAJCOM  headquarters  appoints  an  officer,  senior  to  the  member  imposing  the nonjudicial punishment, to complete the review. 7.3.3.  For an NJP imposed by the host commander on a TDY or tenant member, conduct the review through the host Air Force commander’s chain. 7.3.4.  A  commander,  who  is  a  general  officer  or  exercises general  court-martial convening authority  (GCMCA),  may  delegate  his  or  her  review  authority  to  a  principal  assistant  (see AFI 51-202, Nonjudicial Punishment). 7.4.  When a Commander Decides Not to File the Record of NJP in the Selection Record. 7.4.1.  The  commander  imposing  NJP  records  that  decision  by  initialing  the  appropriate selection record decision block on the AF Form 3070. 7.5.  Commander’s Process for Selection Record Decision. 7.5.1.  The  commander  imposing  NJP  punishment  notifies  the  individual  in  writing  of  the intent to file by initialing the appropriate block on the AF Form 3070. 7.5.2.  The  individual  acknowledges  receipt  of  the  notification  and  right  to  submit  a statement, if any, of rebuttal, mitigation, or circumstances for consideration on the AF Form 3070. 7.5.3.  After  reviewing  the  individual’s  statement  and  circumstances,  the  commander determines whether the NJP is appropriate for filing in the selection record. 7.5.3.1.  If  the  commander  decides  not  to  file  the  NJP  in  the  selection  record,  the commander  annotates  the  decision  on  the  AF  Form  3070,  Nonjudicial  Punishment Proceedings and returns the AF Form 3070 to the servicing staff judge advocate. 7.5.3.1.1.  The servicing staff judge advocate forwards a copy of the AF Form 3070 to MPS/FSS Career Development Element after review according to AFI 51-202. 7.5.3.1.2.  The  AF  Form  3070  is  filed  in  the  MPerRGp,  but  not  in  the  individual’s selection record. 7.5.3.2.  If the commander decides to file the NJP in the selection record, the commander annotates the AF Form 3070 and: AFI36-2608  26 OCTOBER 2015   27  7.5.3.2.1.  Forwards  it  to  the  senior  commander  for  review,  if  a  senior  commander review is necessary, (refer to paragraphs 7.2 and 7.3) or 7.5.3.2.2.  If  a  senior  commander  review  is  not  necessary,  forwards  the  NJP  and related correspondence to the servicing staff judge advocate, who forwards a copy to Airman’s MPS/FSS Career Development Element after review according to AFI 51-202. 7.6.    The  MPS/FSS  Career  Development  Element  suspense’s  the  NJP  until  final  action  is complete, then forwards a copy of the review authority’s decision memorandum and/or the NJP to the OCSRGp custodian, if the commander’s decision is to file the NJP in the selection record, and forwards the decision memorandum and/or NJP to the MPerRGp custodian IAW table 7.1. or table 7.2.

Custodians  will  place  their  office  symbol,  initials,  and  date  in  the  upper  right  hand corner of each NJP sent to DPSIRR. (T-3) 7.8.  NJPs  are  filed  in  the  unfavorable  information  file  of  all  officers  effective  1  Feb 1996.  When an NJP is imposed on a colonel or above (including selectees), forward the NJP to AF/DPO and SAF/IG for processing of a determination placing the unfavorable information in a Senior  Official  Unfavorable  Information  File  (SOUIF).    The  decision  to  place  an  NJP  in  the selection record need not parallel the decision to place the NJP in a UIF in accordance with AFI 36-2907, Unfavorable Information File (UIF) Program. 7.9.  The  decision  to include or  exclude the  NJP in  a selection  record may  not  be revoked once it is filed in the MPerRGp. 7.10.  NJP Retention Period.  For lieutenant colonels and below, keep the NJP in the selection record until the officer is afforded one in promotion zone (IPZ) or above promotion zone (APZ) consideration.    For  colonels,  keep  the  NJP  in  the  selection  record  for  the  first  or  subsequent consideration  to  brigadier  general.    Remove  NJP  from  a  selection  record  upon  receipt  of  an approved  appeal  to  have  the  NJP  removed  from  the  selection  record.    If  an  officer  does  not appeal  to  have  the  NJP  removed  from  the  OSR  after  an  IPZ  or  APZ  consideration,  the  NJP  remains  in  the  OSR  until  the  officer  retires,  separates  from  all  military  service,  or  dies.    For senior  NCOs,  keep  for  2  years  after  effective  date  of  punishment  or  after  one  senior  NCO evaluation board. 7.10.1.  Lt  Colonels  and  below  may  request  removal  of  the  NJP  through  an  appeal  process after one IPZ or APZ consideration (for colonels it is the first or subsequent consideration to brigadier  general).    The  appeal  should  be  submitted  to  the  commander  or  review  authority who  originally  directed  the  NJP  placement  in  the  OSR,  or  successor  in  command.      Senior NCOs  may  request  early  removal  of  the  NJP  through  the  commanders  who  originally decided to place the NJP in the selection record, or from successors in command. AFI36-2608  26 OCTOBER 2015   29  7.10.2.  Removal of NJP from the OSR has no bearing on the permanent filing of the NJP in the  Airman’s  military  human  resource  record  (Correspondence  and  Miscellaneous  Group).  All  NJPs  are  permanently  retained  in  the  military  human  resource  record  (Correspondence and Miscellaneous Group) unless set aside in their entirety in accordance with AFI 51-202. 7.11.  When  to  Remove  an  Article  15  from  an  Officer  Selection  Record  or  an  NSR  and  a MPerRGp. 7.11.1.  Introduction:  Use the following information to determine when to remove an Article 15 from appropriate selection record. 7.11.2.  Removal procedures for officers. 7.11.2.1.  An Article 15 issued to an officer after 1 February 1996 that has been placed in their OSR may not be removed until receipt of an approved request for its removal from the  OSR  or  early  removal  is  approved  by  the  appropriate  authority  (see  paragraph 7.11.3.1).    Unless  requested  under  the  early  removal  as  an  exception  to  policy  (see paragraph 7.11.3), the requests for removal are not processed until the officer is afforded one (1) In the Promotion Zone (IPZ) or Above the Promotion Zone (APZ) consideration (Lt  Colonels  and  below)  or  the  first  subsequent  consideration  to  brigadier  general  for Colonel. 7.11.2.2.  If an officer whose Article 15 is placed in the OSR after 1 February 1996 does not  appeal  to  have  it  removed  after  an  IPZ  or  APZ  consideration,  or  consideration  to brigadier general, the Article 15 remains in the OSR until the officer retires, is discharged (complete severance from military status), or dies. 7.11.2.3.  The Article 15 is  permanently  retained in  the MPerRGp (Correspondence and Miscellaneous  Group)  unless  set  aside  in  its  entirety  IAW  AFI  51-202,  Nonjudicial Punishment, or its removal is directed by the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records (AFBCMR). 7.11.3.  Early removal procedures for officers.  Early removal constitutes removal of Article 15 from the OSR prior  to  an IPZ or  APZ consideration.  This  should be considered in  rare instances, as an exception to policy. 7.11.3.1.  The  wing  commander  or  review  authority  that  has  the  authority  to  direct placement of an Article 15 in the OSR, may direct early removal of the Article 15 from the OSR. 7.11.3.2.  The wing commander or review authority makes the early removal decision via a  memorandum  forwarding  the  approved  early  removal  decision  to  the  officer’s immediate commander. 7.11.3.3.  The  wing  commander  or  review  authority  provides  the  officer  an  information copy of the approved early removal decision and forwards the original to the MPS Career Development  Element.    The  Career  Development  Element  forwards  the  original approved  early  removal  decision  to  AFPC/PBR1,    AF/DPO  (for  Colonels  and  Colonel selects)  and  a  copy  to  the  COM/FOA  records  custodian.    For  IMAs  and  Individual Participating  Reservists,  forward  to  HQ  ARPC/DPT,  18420  E.  Silver  Creek  Ave.,  Bldg 390,  Buckley  CO  80011,  with  an  information  copy  to  the  appropriate  program/element manager.   30  AFI36-2608  26 OCTOBER 2015 7.11.3.4.  AFPC/PBR1, AF/DPG, AF/DPO, or ARPC/DPBR as appropriate, removes the Article  15  from  the  OSR  with  destruction  IAW  AF  Records  Disposition  Schedule  in AFRIMS  and  forwards to AFPC/DPSIR for file in the Military Human Resource Record. the  approved  early  removal  decision  memorandum 7.11.3.5.  The  MAJCOM/FOA  records  custodian  removes  the  Article  15  from  the  OSR upon  receipt  of  their  copy  of  the  approved  early  removal  decision  memorandum  and destroys the Article 15 IAW AF Records Disposition Schedule.   Note:  Early removal of the Article 15 has  no bearing  on the permanent filing of the Article 15 in  the Airman’s MHRR.  All Article 15s are permanently retained in the MHRR unless set aside in their entirety IAW AFI 51-202. 7.11.4.  Removal procedures for Senior NCOs. 7.11.4.1.  Remove  from  NSR  2  years  after  effective  date  of  punishment  or  after  one senior NCO evaluation board. 7.11.5.  Early  removal  is  authorized  for  senior  NCOs  only  if  approved  by  the  current commander. 7.11.6.  The  Article  15  is  permanently  retained  in  the  MPerGp  (Correspondence  and Miscellaneous  Group)  unless  set  aside  in  its  entirety  IAW  AFI  51-202  or  its  removal  is directed by the AFBCMR. 7.12.  How to Process a Request to Have an Article 15 Removed from an OSR. 7.12.1.  Colonels cannot submit a request to have an Article 15 removed from the OSR until they have been afforded first or subsequent consideration to a brigadier general. 7.12.1.1.  Lt  Colonels  and  below  cannot  submit  a  request  for  removal  of  an  Article  15 from  the  OSR  until  they  have  been  afforded  an  IPZ  or  APZ  consideration.    Airmen cannot request early removal; only the wing commander or review authority may request early removal as an exception to policy (paragraph 7.11.3). 7.12.2.  Procedures: The affected officer requests removal of the Article 15 from the OSR via memorandum to wing commander or review authority. 7.12.2.1.  The decision authority reviews the officer’s request for removal of the Article 15 from the OSR. If the request for removal of the Article 15 from the OSR is denied, the decision authority notifies the officer’s commander via memorandum, who provides the original memorandum to the officer. 7.12.2.2.  If  the  request  for  removal  of  the  Article  15  from  the  OSR  is  approved,  the decision authority forwards the approved request for removal of the Article 15 from the selection record via memorandum to the officer’s commander, who provides the officer a copy  of  the  approved  appeal  and  forwards  the  original  to  MPS  Career  Development Element. 7.12.2.3.  For  Lt  Colonels  and  below,  the  MPS/FSS  Career  Development  Element forwards  original  approved  request  for  removal  of  the  Article  15  from  the  selection record  to  AFPC/PBR1  or  ARPC/DPT.  For  Colonel  and  Colonel  selectees,  request  for removal of the Article 15 from the OSR is forward to AF/DPO. AFI36-2608  26 OCTOBER 2015   31  7.12.2.4.  MPS/FSS Career Development Element also forwards a copy of the approved request  for  removal  of  the  Article  15  from  the  OSR  to  the  officers’  MAJCOM/FOA OCSRGp  custodian.    MAJCOM/FOA  OCSRGp  custodian  removes  Article  15  from OCSRGp and destroys IAW AF Records Disposition Schedule in AFRIMS. 7.12.2.5.  AFPC/PBR1,  AFGOMO,  AF/DPO,  or  ARPC/DPTT  as  appropriate,  removes Article  15  and  AF  FORM  3070C  from  OSR  and  forwards  with  approved  request  for removal of the Article 15 from the OSR to AFPC/DPSIR. 7.12.2.6.

An  officer  who  receives  a  LOR  on  or  after  1  February  1996  is  notified  by  the immediate commander by memorandum that the officer’s senior rater decides whether to file the LOR in the OSR.  The memorandum provides the officer 3 duty days in which to submit written comments as to why the LOR should not be filed in the OSR.  The memorandum also directs the officer to return the written statement to the immediate commander, who, in turn, forwards the memorandum with a recommendation to the senior rater.  The decision to place the LOR in the OSR also applies to filing the LOR in the OCSRGp for LAF officers in grade of  captain  when  they  complete  7  years  of  active  commissioned  service,  4  years  for  ANG computed from the PSD and for non-line officers upon promotion to rank of captain. 8.3.2.

LOR retention period.  LORs filed in the OSR remain until the officer is afforded one IPZ or APZ consideration unless a request is submitted and approved under the early removal as an exception to policy (see paragraph 8.3.15).  The officer may appeal to his or her senior rater for removal after one IPZ or APZ consideration.  Airmen cannot request early removal; only the wing commander or issuing authority, in grade of 0-7 or higher, may request early removal as an exception to policy (paragraph 8.3.15). 8.3.9.  LOR Appeal Procedures.  The appeal is made via memorandum to the officer’s senior rater.    If  approved,  the  senior  rater  forwards  the  appeal  approval  decision  to  the  officer’s immediate commander. 8.3.10.  The  immediate  commander  provides  the  officer  an  information  copy  of  the  appeal approval  letter  and  forwards  the  original  to  the  MPS  Career  Development  Element.

If the officer does not appeal removal of the LOR after an IPZ or APZ consideration, the LOR remains in the OSR until the officer is discharged-complete severance from military status, retires, or dies. 8.3.15.  Early removal procedures.  The wing commander or issuing authority, in the grade of 0-7  or  higher,  may  direct  early  removal  of  the  LOR  from  the  OSR.      Early  removal constitutes removal of the LOR from the OSR  prior  to  an IPZ or  APZ  consideration.  This should be considered in rare instances,  as  an exception to  policy, e.g., evidence is  obtained demonstrating the officer did not engage in the misconduct. 8.3.15.1.  Upon approval, the wing commander or issuing authority, whichever is higher, forwards the approved early removal decision to the officer’s immediate commander via memorandum 8.3.15.2.  The commander provides the officer an information copy of the approved early removal decision and forwards the original to the MPS Career Development Element. 8.3.15.3.  The  Career  Development  Element  forwards  the  original  approved  early removal  decision  to  AFPC/DPSIRR,  ARPC/DPT,  AF/DPO  (  for  Colonels  and  Colonel   34  AFI36-2608  26 OCTOBER 2015 selects) and a copy to the MAJCOM/FOA records custodian.

The MAJCOM/FOA records custodian removes the LOR from the OSCR upon receipt of their copy of the approved early removal decision memorandum and destroys the LOR IAW AF Records Disposition Schedule in AFRIMS. 8.3.15.5.  Early removal of the LOR has no bearing on the permanent filing of theory in the  Airman’s  MHRR.    AFPC/PBR1  forwards  the  LOR  filed  in  the  OSR  for  file  in  the MHRR.  LORs filed in the OSR are permanently retained in the MHRR. AFI36-2608  26 OCTOBER 2015   35  Chapter 9 REQUESTING DEROGATORY DATA FROM THE MHRR 9.1.  Introduction.
