Purpose. This AFMAN has been issued to provide users with application, selection, installation, andmaintenance guidance for valve-regulated lead-acid (VRLA) batteries. The purpose of the requirementscontained in this AFMAN is to assure the most reliable system possible with VRLA batteries. VRLA bat-teries are relatively new to the market and they have exhibited different aging and failure modes than tra-ditional vented batteries.  For this reason, this AFMAN provides a detailed explanation of VRLA batterydesign, degradation, and failure.  Traditional vented lead-acid batteries are discussed only to the degreenecessary to explain key differences between vented and VRLA batteries.  The background information iseducational in nature and is intended to provide insight into the purposes of the requirements for VRLAbattery application, installation, and maintenance.1.2. Need for Special Maintenance Procedures. VRLA batteries are more likely to fail before the endof their stated service life than are traditional vented lead-acid batteries, and their failure can be harder todetect by conventional methods.  The maintenance requirements contained in this AFPAM are necessaryto detect the onset of individual cell failures before the reliability of the entire battery is jeopardized.Detailed maintenance procedures are included to facilitate the required maintenance.1.3. Material Covered. The complete life cycle of VRLA batteries is covered in this AFPAM, includingselection, application, installation, periodic maintenance, testing, and eventual replacement.1.4. Applicability:1.4.1. Authority.  This AFPAM complies with Air Force Instruction 32-1080, Electric Power Sys-tems.1.4.2. Type of Systems Covered.  Compliance with the AFPAM is mandatory for VRLA stationarybatteries in exterior and interior electrical systems that are the responsibility of the Base Civil Engi-neer at all facilities and bases. This AFMAN does not apply to motive power, air ground equipment(AGE), or aircraft batteries.AFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 19995Chapter 2 LEAD-ACID BATTERY FUNDAMENTALS2.1. Electrochemical Process:2.1.1. A battery provides electrical power by converting its stored chemical energy into electricalenergy.  This energy conversion is achieved by a chemical reaction in the battery that releases elec-trons.  The process is reversible in a stationary battery.  If a load is placed across the battery terminals,the chemical reaction produces electrical power.  If electrical energy is directed into the battery(charging the battery), the chemical reaction reverses and restores the battery to a fully charged condi-tion.2.1.2. The generation of electrical current from a cell originates from a difference in electrochemicalpotential between two compounds inside the cell that are not in direct contact, but are connected by anelectrically conducting medium.  The two compounds are installed in the cell as positive and negativeplates, and the connecting medium between the two plates is referred to as the electrolyte.  As theplate materials chemically react with the electrolyte, a potential difference is created between theplates and the electrolyte.  The positive plates have a positive potential in relation to the electrolyte;the negative plates have a negative potential in relation to the electrolyte.  The electrochemical pro-cess between the plates and electrolyte creates a voltage between the positive and negative plates ofthe cell.2.1.3. In a lead-acid battery, the positive plate material is lead dioxide (PbO2) and the negative platematerial is lead (Pb).  The plate material is often referred to as the active material.  The electrolyte isa sulfuric acid solution (H2SO4).2.1.4. The overall chemical reaction within a lead-acid battery is described as the full cell reaction,and is given by:PbO2 + Pb + 2H2SO4  «  2PbSO4 + 2H2O2.1.5. Several observations can be made regarding the electrochemical process of a lead-acid battery:2.1.5.1. When the battery terminals are connected to an external circuit, the current that flowsfrom the battery is proportional to the potential difference of the plates and is limited mainly bythe circuit resistance.  The external connection provides a flow path for electrons, and therebyfacilitates the conditions needed to sustain the chemical reaction.  If the external circuit resistanceis too small (short circuit), the current flow is limited mainly by the efficiency of the chemicalreaction.2.1.5.2. The sulfuric acid electrolyte is consumed in the discharge reaction and water is produced.Thus, the acid is continuously diluted during discharge.  The decreasing concentration of acid inthe electrolyte represents a decrease in the state of charge of the battery.2.1.5.3. The active materials of both plates, lead and lead dioxide, are consumed during the dis-charge reaction and lead sulfate is produced.  The lead sulfate is deposited onto both positive andnegative plates as it is produced.  Thus, the material composition of the plates changes during dis-charge.6AFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 19992.1.5.4. The cell becomes less able to sustain the chemical reaction as the concentration of activematerial and acid decreases during discharge.  Eventually, the quantity of active material or sulfu-ric acid (depending on which is limiting) is not sufficient to maintain the reaction at a rate that pro-duces measurable current flow.2.1.5.5. The injection of electrical energy into a battery during charging reverses the chemicalreaction in the cell.  To drive the chemical reaction in the charge direction, the battery must absorbenergy.  Thus, during charging, electrical energy is transformed to chemical energy.2.1.5.6. Because the electrolyte is conductive, the chemical reaction can occur without an externalcircuit, and is referred to as self-discharge or local action.  Self-discharge is usually a slow pro-cess; an open-circuit cell might take several months to over a year before it fully discharges.2.2. Lead-Acid Battery Construction:2.2.1. Basic Construction:2.2.1.1. A lead-acid battery consists of individual cells connected together to provide the desiredoutput voltage.  A single cell consists of positive and negative plates assembled inside a containerthat is filled with a sulfuric acid electrolyte.  The following basic components are assembled tomake a cell:2.2.1.1.1. Container2.2.1.1.2. Lead dioxide positive plates2.2.1.1.3. Lead negative plates2.2.1.1.4. Separators and retainers2.2.1.1.5. Sulfuric acid electrolyte2.2.1.2. These components make up the basic building blocks of a lead-acid cell; their design andthe method of construction vary according to the intended application.  The following characteris-tics are commonly changed to tailor a battery to a specific application:2.2.1.2.1. Plate and grid alloy material, alloy concentration, or geometry2.2.1.2.2. Number of plates2.2.1.2.3. Separator material type and thickness2.2.1.2.4. Retainer design2.2.1.2.5. Electrolyte specific gravity2.2.1.2.6. Post seal design (copper inserts) or number of posts2.2.2. Plate Design:2.2.2.1. Lead-acid cells are defined by their plate construction and the alloys used in the plates.The pasted flat plate is the most common design for vented and VRLA cells.  When a pasted flatplate is assembled, lead oxide (PbO) paste is applied to a lead alloy grid structure, and thenallowed to dry in place.  The lead oxide paste is called the active material.  A grid structure con-taining the active material is a plate.  Typical grids for a pasted flat plate are shown in figure 2.1..After the lead oxide paste has dried, the plates are immersed in a dilute sulfuric acid solution andAFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 19997current is passed through them, with opposite polarities for the positive and negative plates.  Thelead oxide (PbO) is converted to lead dioxide (PbO2) in the positive plates and to lead (Pb) in thenegative plates.  Figure 2.2. shows typical pasted flat plates with the active material in place.8AFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 1999Figure 2.1. Typical Positive and Negative Grids.AFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 1999Figure 2.1.  Continued.910AFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 1999Figure 2.2. Typical Positive and Negative Pasted Flat Plate.AFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 1999Figure 2.2.  Continued.112.2.2.2. Pasted flat plates are installed vertically in the cell.  The plates are fused at the top of thecell to straps and posts, which conduct current from the plates to external cell connections.  Posi-tive plates might hang from the positive plate straps or container sidewalls, or might be cantile-vered from the negative plates.  The negative plates are usually supported by the negative platestraps and by feet that rest on the floor of the battery case.  The plate support design is an impor-tant part of cell long-term battery reliability.  Positive plates gradually grow larger during the ser-vice life.  This plate growth must not place excessive internal stress or pressure on the container.A typical assembly of the plates into a cell container is shown in figure 2.3.12Figure 2.3. Plate Assembly in Cell.AFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 19992.2.2.3. The grid structure of the cell has two functions:2.2.2.3.1. To provide mechanical support for the active material, which does not by itself havethe strength to be self-supporting.2.2.2.3.2. To act as a conductor to transmit current from all parts of the active material to theplate terminal.  The ideal grid design should maintain a uniform current distribution through-out the active material.  An uneven current distribution could result in buckling of the platesduring charge and discharge cycles.2.2.2.4. The ideal grid has the following characteristics:2.2.2.4.1. High conductivity2.2.2.4.2. High strength2.2.2.4.3. Corrosion resistance2.2.2.4.4. Compatibility with the active materials2.2.2.4.5. Manufacturability2.2.2.5. Simultaneously achieving the above ideal grid characteristics is part of the art of batteryconstruction.  The grid is usually composed of a lead alloy in which the lead is hardened by theAFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 199913alloy so that the grid can support the plate assembly.  Lead calcium-based grids are commonlyused for VRLA cell designs.  Other materials might also be added to the basic lead calcium designto improve operational or manufacturing performance.   For example, tin (0.3% to 0.6%) has beenadded to some lead calcium grids to:2.2.2.5.1. Increase the grid alloy tensile strength.2.2.2.5.2. Improve the ease of handling during manufacturing.2.2.2.5.3. Inhibit passivation (a high resistance boundary) between the grid and active mate-rial on the positive plate.2.2.2.6. Stationary batteries normally have n positive plates and n+1 negative plates.  In thisdesign, negative plates are on both sides of each positive plate to ensure that the positive platechemical reaction is balanced.  Otherwise, the more age-sensitive positive plate could expandabnormally or buckle because of an uneven chemical reaction rate.2.2.3. Electrolyte:2.2.3.1. The electrolyte in a lead-acid battery is a mixture of sulfuric acid and water.  Specificgravity is a measure of the density of a liquid. The specific gravity of the electrolyte indicates theamount of sulfuric acid in the cell.  Pure water has a specific gravity of 1.0 and the specific gravityof other liquids is usually expressed in relation to that of water.  The lead-acid cell electrolyte spe-cific gravity typically varies from 1.210 to 1.300, depending on the particular cell design.  Mostvented stationary cells have a specific gravity between 1.210 to 1.240.  VRLA batteries commonlyuse electrolyte with a higher specific gravity (typically between 1.250 to 1.300) to compensate fora smaller quantity of electrolyte in the cell.2.2.4. Separators:2.2.4.1. Separators are installed between the plates to prevent the plates from touching and short-ing.  A separator is constructed of a porous, nonconductive, inert material that allows conductionof electrolyte ions between the plates.2.2.5. Container Construction:2.2.5.1. The battery components are enclosed in a plastic jar that functions as a leak proof con-tainer for the electrolyte.  The top cover is bonded to the jar and a flame arrestor vent is installedon the cover to allow charge gases to escape.2.2.5.2. The positive and negative cell terminals are usually designed for bolted connections andare often constructed of alloyed lead.  Some batteries contain copper reinforcement inserts toimprove conductivity and optimize high discharge rate performance.  Copper inserts are typicallyused on the larger cells.2.2.5.3. Jar-to-cover and terminal post seals are critical features of a cell design.  A poor seal cancontribute to the following problems:2.2.5.3.1. Acid creepage up the post causing increased corrosion2.2.5.3.2. Acid creepage up the post causing increased connection resistance, which can affectcapacity or, in severe cases, result in post meltdown during discharge2.2.5.3.3. Cell gases venting without the protection of a flame arrestor14AFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 19992.2.5.3.4. Electrical faults which can lead to fire or electrical shocks2.2.5.3.5. Air in-leakage to a VRLA cell that can lead to self-discharge2.3. Electrical Characteristics:2.3.1. Voltage:2.3.1.1. A fully charged lead-acid cell has an open circuit voltage (OCV) of approximately 2.05 Vto 2.15 V; the exact voltage varies with the electrolyte specific gravity and temperature.  The OCVincreases as the specific gravity increases, and decreases as the temperature decreases.  The OCVvaries with electrolyte specific gravity by the following relationship:OCV = Specific gravity + 0.8452.3.1.2. For example, the OCV of a cell with an electrolyte specific gravity of 1.215 is 2.06 V(1.215 + 0.845 = 2.06).  The OCV of a cell with an electrolyte specific gravity of 1.300 is 2.15 V(1.300 + 0.845 = 2.15).2.3.1.3. The charging float voltage must be greater than the cell OCV to overcome the cell’s inter-nal resistance and allow charging current to flow through the cell.  The actual difference betweenthe cell OCV and the desired charging float voltage is a function of the grid alloy type, specificgravity, and temperature, but is usually in the range of 0.10 to 0.20 V at 25°C (77°F).2.3.1.4. When a lead-acid battery is at full capacity, receiving a trickle charge from the batterycharger, it is said to be on a float charge.  A float charge overcomes the battery’s natural tendencyto self-discharge, thereby keeping it fully charged.  The float voltage for a lead-acid batterydepends on the individual cell design and temperature.  The optimal float voltage is determined bythe manufacturer.  An equalizing charge is intended to recharge the battery quickly and to com-pletely restore the active materials in the plates.  An equalizing charge is performed at a highervoltage than a float charge; the recommended equalize voltage value varies with the battery designand electrolyte specific gravity.2.3.2. Discharge Characteristics:2.3.2.1. The expected voltage profile for a battery undergoing a constant current discharge isshown in figure 2.4.  The battery experiences an initial drop in voltage when it begins to dis-charge.  After the voltage stabilizes from its initial drop, the voltage gradually decreases with timeas the active materials and sulfuric acid are consumed in the chemical reaction.  Toward the end ofdischarge, insufficient quantities of active material or sulfuric acid exist to sustain the chemicalreaction and the voltage declines rapidly.  AFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 199915Figure 2.4. Typical Cell Voltage Profile During Constant Current Discharge.2.3.2.2. A battery is often considered to be discharged when its voltage reaches 1.75 VPC duringa discharge at its rated capacity.  However, the system design could require a higher voltage (orallow a lower voltage) to meet the voltage requirements of all components.  For some high-ratedischarge applications, the battery manufacturer might provide discharge ratings for end voltagesas low as 1.5 VPC.  Manufacturers rarely provide discharge ratings below 1.5 VPC; once voltagehas fallen this low, the rate of voltage decline is very rapid and little additional energy can beremoved from the battery at that discharge rate.2.3.2.3. Notice that figure 2.4. shows an initial voltage drop that quickly recovers, followed by along slow discharge thereafter.  Figure 2.5. shows in greater detail the discharge voltage character-istic at the beginning of the discharge.  The initial voltage drop observed during discharge occursbecause of two effects.  First, the loss of the battery charger float voltage causes the battery voltageto fall to its open circuit voltage, or lower; the amount of voltage drop depends on the dischargerate.  An additional temporary voltage dip might be also observed in which the battery voltage ini-tially falls to some minimum level, followed by a slow recovery to a slightly higher voltage duringthe first few minutes of discharge.  This initial voltage dip is referred to as the coup-de-fouet andits effect is primarily observed on stationary lead-acid batteries that have been maintained on along-term float charge.16AFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 1999Figure 2.5. Typical Voltage Dip at Beginning of Discharge.2.3.2.4. The coup-de-fouet primarily occurs with batteries on long term float for the followingreason.  The float charge process maintains the positive plates in a nearly fully charged condition,in which the active material is all lead dioxide, PbO2, with very little lead sulfate, PbSO4, presentunder ideal conditions.  During discharge, lead dioxide is converted to lead sulfate.  However, thechemical reaction is better facilitated when a lead dioxide molecule is located adjacent to a leadsulfate molecule.  In other words, the chemical reaction process improves in efficiency as lead sul-fate sites are generated.  During the initial moments of discharge, the chemical reaction is slightlyless efficient, with the result that the voltage can dip to a lower than expected value and slowlyrecover from this voltage dip during the first few minutes of discharge as these lead sulfate sitesare created.2.3.2.5. The coup-de-fouet effect is described here because it can limit the high-rate dischargecapability of a particular cell design.  Some users have been caught by surprise during the firstminute of a high-rate discharge.  In the 1980s, some UPS users experienced a high rate dischargeon their system in which battery voltage would fall below the low-voltage cutout of the UPS dur-ing the first minute of discharge.  After resetting the low-voltage cutout, the UPS would performnormally without again actuating its low-voltage cutout.  After further investigation, it was dis-covered that the coup-de-fouet dip during the first discharge had fallen low enough to trip thelow-voltage cutout.  But, in so doing, enough lead sulfate sites had been established that the sub-sequent battery discharge at the same rate would not experience as low of a dip.  Some batterymanufacturers were forced to derate their cell ratings to account for this effect.2.3.2.6. In summary, the ideal long duration discharge has the following discharge characteristics:2.3.2.6.1. An initial prompt voltage drop, followed by2.3.2.6.2. A modest recovery in voltage during the first few minutes of discharge, followed byAFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 1999172.3.2.6.3. A gradual and almost linear voltage drop during most of the discharge period, and2.3.2.6.4. A rapid nonlinear voltage drop at the end of discharge2.3.3. Capacity:2.3.3.1. The rate (amperes or power) at which a lead-acid battery is discharged directly affects theampere-hours that the battery can deliver—as the discharge rate increases, the ampere-hours thatcan be realized from the battery decreases.  Decreased capacity at higher discharge rates is due tothe following effects:2.3.3.1.1. Less time is available for diffusion of electrolyte into the porous lead plates.  Thehigher the discharge rate, the more the chemical reaction is limited to the surface of the plates.2.3.3.1.2. The discharge chemical reaction process forms larger lead sulfate on the surface ofthe plates, which tends to close pores in the plates, thereby slowing electrolyte access to theremaining active material.2.3.3.1.3. Voltage loss occurs more quickly because of increased cell internal resistance dur-ing discharge.2.3.3.2. Battery capacity is normally described in terms of the number of ampere-hours or wattsthat the battery can supply for a specified time before voltage falls below a minimum value.  Abattery capacity rating for a typical battery is provided in table 2.1.  If the battery depicted in thetable is discharging at 360 amperes, it is said to be discharging at the 5-hour rate.  The table showsthat total capacity is reduced at higher loads, as discussed previously.  For example, a load of 250amperes can be sustained for 8 hours (total capacity = 250 amperes x 8 hours = 2,000ampere-hours).  However, a load of 950 amperes can be maintained only for 1 hour (capacity =950 ampere-hours). Table 2.1. Typical Capacity Rating.Discharge Time(hours to end voltage)Capacity(ampere-hours)85312,0001,8001,500   950Effective Discharge Rate (amperes)2503605009502.3.3.3. The available battery capacity depends on the minimum allowed cell voltage during dis-charge.  Manufacturers often provide capacity values referenced to 1.75 VPC end voltage at 25°C(77°F).  If the user’s application requires a higher minimum voltage, such as 1.81 VPC, the cellwill not be able to provide the rated discharge for as long as it can to 1.75 VPC.  Thus, the celleffectively has less available capacity as the minimum voltage requirement is increased.2.3.4. Temperature Effects:2.3.4.1. Temperature affects lead-acid battery performance.  For the sake of standardization, bat-tery performance ratings are normally specified at a temperature of 25°C (77°F).  A lead-acid bat-tery is an electrochemical device whose characteristics vary with temperature; heat accelerateschemical activity and cold slows it down.  A change in the electrolyte temperature from the refer-ence temperature has two significant effects on lead-acid battery performance:18AFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 19992.3.4.1.1. The battery capacity decreases as the temperature drops below 25°C (77°F).2.3.4.1.2. The battery life decreases as the temperature rises above 25°C (77°F).2.3.4.2. At temperatures lower than 25°C (77°F), the battery cannot provide its rated capacity.  Ingeneral, a lower temperature increases the viscosity of the electrolyte, and thus restricts its abilityto circulate into the plates.  Also, the efficiency of the chemical reaction decreases as temperaturedecreases.2.3.4.3. Temperature variations have an opposite effect on battery life.  The battery’s positiveplate corrosion rate increases exponentially as the electrolyte temperature rises above 25°C(77°F); sustained battery operation above 25°C (77°F) shortens battery life.  For example, a com-mon rule of thumb for lead-acid batteries is that an 8.3°C (15°F) average temperature risedecreases battery life by 50%.  2.3.4.4. The temperature characteristics of the battery must be evaluated at the design stage on thebasis of the expected temperature environment.  A battery located in a cold area might require der-ating to ensure that sufficient capacity is available to power the connected load for the specifiedduration.  A battery in a high-temperature area will fail before reaching its advertised service life.Rated capacity and life are simultaneously obtained only when the battery is operated near 25°C(77°F).2.4. Valve-Regulated Lead-Acid (VRLA) Battery Design:2.4.1. Introduction to the VRLA Battery:2.4.1.1. The previous sections provided technical information generally applicable to all lead-acidbatteries, including both vented and VRLA types.  This section provides design features unique tothe VRLA battery.2.4.1.2. The VRLA battery is an innovative design with many useful applications.  It is effec-tively sealed such that the user can not gain access to the electrolyte.  And, the electrolyte is immo-bilized so that it is not a free liquid as in a vented cell, with the result that a VRLA cell will leaklittle or no electrolyte if the container case is damaged. 2.4.1.3. Traditional vented lead-acid battery maintenance practices such as verifying electrolytelevel and adding water cannot be performed on a VRLA battery because each cell is effectivelysealed and the interior is inaccessible. VRLA batteries have been called sealed batteries becausethey are completely sealed except for a pressure relief valve that opens as needed to vent excessinternal pressure.  They have also been called maintenance-free batteries because periodic wateraddition is not allowed by the design.  However, VRLA batteries are neither truly sealed nor main-tenance free.  The term starved electrolyte has also been used to describe VRLA batteries, refer-ring to a lack of excess electrolyte.  As the term starved electrolyte implies, the capacity of aVRLA battery can be limited by its electrolyte quantity.  The term valve-regulated has become thestandard name for this type of lead-acid battery.  A typical VRLA cell is shown in figure 2.6.AFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 1999Figure 2.6. Typical VRLA Cell.192.4.1.4. A bank of VRLA cells is often configured very differently than is a conventional ventedbattery bank.  Vented cells must sit upright on racks to prevent electrolyte from spilling out of theflame arrestor or service ports.  VRLA batteries have fewer limitations on cell orientation becausethe electrolyte has been immobilized.  Manufacturers have capitalized on this feature to reduce theoverall installed battery footprint.  By installing the cells sideways in stackable modules, manufac-turers have reduced the total required floor space for an installation.  A horizontal installation ofVRLA cell modules is shown in figure 2.7.20AFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 1999Figure 2.7. VRLA Battery Installed Horizontally (Shown With and Without Protective Covers).AFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 1999Figure 2.7.  Continued.212.4.2. Recombination Cycle:2.4.2.1. The internal charge and discharge chemical reaction of a VRLA cell is the same as that ina vented cell.  During discharge, lead on the negative plate and lead dioxide on the positive platecombine with sulfuric acid in the electrolyte to form lead sulfate on the plates and release elec-trons:PbO2 + Pb + 2H2SO4  «  2PbSO4 + 2H2O2.4.2.2. The above chemical reaction represents the net overall process; the actual chemical reac-tion on each plate is considerably more complex.  The chemical reaction is also reversible so thatthe cell can be recharged.  During standby float-charge operation, the applied charge is intended tomaintain the cell in a fully charged condition.  In either a vented or VRLA cell, charging currentbeyond that necessary to overcome the cell’s tendency to self-discharge causes water to be disas-sociated into oxygen and hydrogen.  In a vented cell, this lost water must periodically be replaced.VRLA batteries provide a means of recombining these charge gases, which reduces water loss.22AFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 1999Oxygen gas that evolves at the positive plate is allowed to migrate through the electrolyte to thenegative plate, where the recombination reaction occurs.  In a properly operating VRLA cell, oxy-gen is generated at the positive plate, but hydrogen generation at the negative plate is suppressedby the recombination process.  The primary factor in a VRLA cell’s ability to recombine chargegases is its efficiency in transporting the oxygen generated at the positive plates to the negativeplates.  When operating properly, a VRLA cell can recombine charge gases with an efficiencyapproaching 100%.2.4.3. VRLA Cell Construction:2.4.3.1. Absorbed Electrolyte Construction:2.4.3.1.1. Two VRLA cell designs are available and they are completely different in theirapproach to immobilizing the electrolyte.  The two types are the absorbed electrolyte and thegelled electrolyte.2.4.3.1.2. An absorbed electrolyte design is constructed with the liquid electrolyte containedin highly absorbent glass mat separators positioned between the plates.  This type of cell iscalled an absorbed glass mat (AGM) cell by some manufacturers.  Absorbed electrolyte sys-tems generally have a low internal resistance that allows the cell to provide a very high ratecurrent.2.4.3.1.3. The mat holds the electrolyte in place by capillary action, similar to the way asponge holds water.  The electrolyte is distributed throughout the mat and the mat is com-pressed between the plates to maintain the electrolyte in contact with the active material of theplates.  2.4.3.1.4. Achieving oxygen transport for an absorbed electrolyte cell involves creating voids,or gas channels, in the liquid-saturated mat through which the oxygen can migrate from thepositive to the negative plates.  Voids exist because the mats are filled to only 90% to 95% oftheir total capacity.  With 5% to 10% of a mat’s volume not filled, there are channels that allowoxygen migration.  2.4.3.1.5. One consequence of only partially filling the mat is that AGM cells can be limitedin their capacity by the quantity of sulfuric acid in the electrolyte.  A vented cell has a largeelectrolyte reserve, with the electrolyte level well above the top of the plates, and it is rarelycapacity-limited by the electrolyte.  At best, an AGM cell starts with the electrolyte level at thetop of plates because the mat is wrapped around the plates and is not fully saturated with elec-trolyte.  This makes the AGM cell particularly susceptible to a loss of capacity if any electro-lyte is lost.  The gradual loss of water from an AGM cell is referred to as dryout and isdescribed in detail in paragraph 3.2.1.2.4.3.2. Gelled Electrolyte Construction:2.4.3.2.1. The gelled electrolyte cell design is similar to a vented cell except that the electro-lyte has been gelled to immobilize it in place.  The electrolyte is combined with a silica com-pound to create the gelled solution.  In addition to gelling the electrolyte, the silica alsofacilitates oxygen transport from the positive to the negative plates.2.4.3.2.2. The primary method of oxygen transport in a gelled electrolyte cell is throughmicroscopic cracks created in the gel after a short period of operation.  Initially, the gel has fewcracks; therefore, oxygen transport is poor and the cell recombination efficiency is low whenAFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 199923the cell is first placed in service.  This condition results in some water loss during the earlystages of operation.  The water loss causes the gel to contract, forming microscopic cracks inthe gel structure.  As the cracks are formed, oxygen transport is facilitated and the recombina-tion efficiency increases to a steady-state level.  Water loss is minimized after the cell entersthe recombinant mode of operation.  The silica added to the electrolyte also tends to increasethe rate of oxygen transport by allowing oxygen to move over the surface of the silica chains,fibers, or filaments.2.4.3.2.3. One consequence of the gelled electrolyte design is that it vents gases during thefirst several months of operation until it finally becomes recombinant.  This means it ventshydrogen just like a vented cell during its early life.  Manufacturers’ literature might state thatVRLA cells vent little or no hydrogen during normal operation, but the literature often doesnot address the potential for hydrogen emission when first placed in service.2.4.3.2.4. The gelled electrolyte cell can have a higher internal resistance than the absorbedelectrolyte cell, and might not be as effective for high rate/short duration discharges.  In somerespects, the gelled design can be thought of as a vented cell in which the liquid has beenimmobilized by gelling it.  The gelled design has a greater electrolyte reserve than the AGMcell and is usually better suited for long duration applications.  A gelled electrolyte cell is typ-ically heavier and larger than an absorbed electrolyte cell for a given capacity.  2.4.3.2.5. The gelled electrolyte cell is not as widely used as the AGM cell.  The AGM cell iseasier to manufacture and recycle.  Also, the AGM cell usually has a higher power density ina smaller footprint.2.4.3.3. Pressure Relief Valve:2.4.3.3.1. The VRLA cell is sealed such that the user can not add water to it.  But, the VRLAis not completely sealed; its design includes a pressure relief valve to limit the maximum inter-nal pressure of the cell, maintain a minimum internal pressure to promote recombination andminimize water loss, and prevent atmospheric oxygen from entering the cell and dischargingthe negative plates.2.4.3.3.2. Depending on the design, VRLA cells typically operate with a positive internalpressure of 0.5 to 6 psig.  The pressure relief valve vents any pressure exceeding the designlimit.2.4.3.3.3. The pressure relief valve must be able to open and reseal within a fairly narrowpressure band.  Although the pressure relief valve must be capable of opening to prevent cellover-pressurization under abusive conditions, it is also critical that it recloses properly.  Air(containing oxygen) entering through an open pressure relief valve will eventually dischargethe negative plate by a chemical reaction with the oxygen in the air and cause a permanent lossof capacity.  Proper pressure relief valve operation is vital to continued operation of the cell.Typical design constraints placed on the pressure relief valve by manufacturers include:2.4.3.3.3.1. Vent pressure should be low to minimize pressure bulging of the container.2.4.3.3.3.2. Vent pressure should change very little as the gassing rate increases.2.4.3.3.3.3. Vent outlet should be as large as possible to insure rapid venting.2.4.3.3.3.4. Valve elastomer material should be resistant to ozone cracking and acid.24AFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 19992.4.3.3.3.5. Under static conditions, air must not be able to enter the cell.2.4.4. Operational Characteristics:2.4.4.1. Electrolyte Concentration:2.4.4.1.1. A vented lead-acid cell has a substantial electrolyte reserve and its capacity is usu-ally limited by the quantity of active material in its plates.  The term starved electrolyte hasbeen used to describe VRLA batteries, typically referring to the limited quantity of electrolytein an AGM cell.  Depending on the design, the capacity of a VRLA cell can be limited by itselectrolyte quantity.2.4.4.1.2. Manufacturers have attempted to improve VRLA battery capacity by increasing theelectrolyte specific gravity of some AGM cells to as high as 1.300 (typical vented stationarybatteries have a specific gravity of 1.210 to 1.240).  A higher specific gravity means that moresulfuric acid is available to participate in the chemical reaction during discharge.  Increasingthe specific gravity also affects VRLA operating characteristics such as float voltage range andrated life.  The gelled electrolyte design typically has a greater electrolyte reserve than theAGM design and generally does not require as high of a specific gravity to compensate forelectrolyte-limited capacity.2.4.4.2. Electrical Characteristics:2.4.4.2.1. The electrical characteristics described in paragraph 2.3. apply to both vented andVRLA cells.  The principal electrical difference between the two types is how the float voltageis distributed across the positive and negative plates.  This section explains this key differencebetween vented and VRLA cells.2.4.4.2.2. Float voltage is applied by the charger to maintain each cell fully charged.  If thefloat voltage is too low, the cells can self-discharge and slowly lose capacity.  If the float volt-age is too high, the cells are overcharged, causing gassing and premature aging.  Each batterytype has a particular float voltage range within which optimal performance is expected—thebattery remains fully charged without significant overcharging.2.4.4.2.3. The open circuit voltage (OCV) is the voltage across the cell terminals when noth-ing is connected to it.  Part of the OCV is made up by the positive plate positive potential withrespect to the electrolyte.  The remainder of the OCV is made up by the negative plate negativepotential with respect to the electrolyte.  The total OCV is the potential of the positive platewith respect to the negative plate.  2.4.4.2.4. If a cell is left on open circuit, it will slowly self-discharge and the OCV will dropas the cell discharges.  When charging current is applied to the cell, the positive and negativeplates polarize (develop an added potential) relative to their open circuit potential.  The polar-ization does not occur immediately because some small amount of charging current is neededto offset the cell’s tendency to self-discharge.  As the charging current is increased, the cell’stotal voltage rises to be the sum of the OCV, the positive plate polarization, and the negativeplate polarization.  The total plate polarization is that potential on the plate in excess of itsOCV potential.2.4.4.2.5. Figure 2.8. shows a typical example of plate polarization as a function of chargingcurrent.  Plate polarization is typically described with respect to the OCV plate potential.  Forthe cell shown in figure 2.8., suppose that the cell OCV is 2.06 V.  As shown for the specificAFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 199925condition of float charging, the total cell voltage is 2.22 V with a polarization (overvoltage) of0.16 V (or 160 mV).  In this case, the polarization voltage is shared between the positive andnegative plates, with 70 mV on the positive plate and 90 mV on the negative plate.  This is atypical arrangement for a vented cell.Figure 2.8. Vented Cell Plate Polarization.2.4.4.2.6. The VRLA cell functions differently than the vented cell.  During normal operation,oxygen is generated at the negative plate, the oxygen migrates to the negative plate, and sup-presses hydrogen evolution at the negative plate.  This recombination process effectivelydepolarizes the negative plate, meaning that the excess charging voltage is applied almostcompletely to the positive plate.2.4.4.2.7. Figure 2.9. shows the typical polarization voltage of a VRLA cell.  As can be seen,very little polarization voltage is applied to the negative plates under normal conditions.  Thecharging current must be abnormally high before significant negative plate polarization is real-ized.  Once the negative plate polarizes, the cell performs similar to a vented cell, with the neg-ative plate also producing hydrogen.  At this point, the rate of gas production exceeds therecombination ability of the cell and it will periodically vent gas through the pressure reliefvalve to relieve the internal pressure.  A fine balance has to be maintained; the voltage has tobe high enough to keep the negative plates from self-discharging, but not so high that the cellvents periodically.  The proper float voltage is very important for VRLA cells.  Paragraph 3.1.provides additional information regarding the detrimental effects of improper float voltages.26AFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 1999Figure 2.9. VRLA Cell Plate Polarization.2.4.4.3. Gas Generation During Operation:2.4.4.3.1. Hydrogen and oxygen gases can be released from a battery during operation.  Oxy-gen evolves at the positive plate and hydrogen at the negative plate.  Gases are generated pri-marily during battery charging; the rate of gas evolution depends on the charge voltage and thecharge current that is not absorbed by the battery.  The excess charge current causes electroly-sis of the water in the electrolyte into hydrogen and oxygen.2.4.4.3.2. Overcharge is the period after which the battery is fully charged when charging cur-rent mainly results in gas generation.  The worst condition for hydrogen generation existswhen maximum current is forced into a fully charged battery.  Charging voltages at or abovethe equalizing charge level encourage gas evolution.2.4.4.3.3. Some typical rules of thumb regarding hydrogen gas generation are providedbelow:2.4.4.3.3.1. Gassing will double for each 0.05 V increase in float voltage for a fullycharged cell.2.4.4.3.3.2. Gassing will double for each 8.3°C (15°F) rise in temperature.2.4.4.3.3.3. Gassing will increase by 10% for each 2,000-ft (610-meter) elevation change.2.4.4.3.3.4. When all charging current is expended to liberate gases, each ampere-hourproduces 25.51 cubic inches (0.418 liters) of hydrogen gas.2.4.4.3.3.5. Per IEEE 1187, the maximum hydrogen generation rate is 0.000269-ft3/minute/ ampere/cell (0.0076 liters/minute/ ampere/cell).AFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 1999272.4.4.3.4. Some battery manufacturers’ literature markets “little or no hydrogen gas emission”as one more attractive design feature of the VRLA cell.  Although it is true that a VRLA celloperating in the recombinant mode will vent very little gas, there are conditions under whichthe VRLA cell can vent as much hydrogen as a vented cell.  For this reason, IEEE standardsspecify that VRLA battery installations should include adequate ventilation to avoid hydrogenbuildup in the area.  2.4.4.3.5. Under the following conditions, a VRLA cell will vent hydrogen:2.4.4.3.5.1. During an equalize charge or elevated float charge.2.4.4.3.5.2. Whenever float voltage is set significantly higher than recommended by themanufacturer regardless of the reason—deliberately set, set in error, charger setpoint drift,or charger failure.2.4.4.3.5.3. During the first few months of operation for a gelled electrolyte cell until itvents enough water to finally become recombinant.  The same consideration applies to anAGM cell that was overfilled at the factory.2.4.4.3.6. The system design must account for the possibility of hydrogen generation even forVRLA batteries.  Not accounting for hydrogen gas emission from a VRLA cell is dangerousand can lead to personnel injury or equipment damage.28AFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 1999Chapter 3 VRLA BATTERY AGING, DEGRADATION, AND FAILURE3.1. Introduction:3.1.1. VRLA batteries exhibit the same aging and degradation characteristics as vented lead-acid bat-teries.  But, they have additional failures modes that are a result of the new technology.  Paragraph 3.2.provides an overview of traditional aging mechanisms for vented lead-acid and VRLA batteries.Paragraph 3.3. discusses additional aging and failure mechanisms specific to VRLA batteries.3.2. Traditional Lead-Acid Battery Aging:3.2.1. Service Life Considerations:3.2.1.1. The lead-acid battery is a sacrificial design, destined to eventually wear out even in idealconditions.  And, when abused, it can fail even sooner.  Under ideal conditions, both vented andVRLA batteries fail by natural aging due to the following causes:3.2.1.1.1. Expansion and corrosion of the positive grid structure due to oxidation of the gridand plate materials.  This degradation mechanism is unavoidable and is the most common nat-ural failure mode for lead-acid batteries maintained on a float charge.3.2.1.1.2. .Loss of active material from the positive plate.3.2.1.1.3. Loss of capacity due to physical changes in the active material of the positive plate.3.2.1.2. Some vented batteries survive longer than 20 years with little loss of capability.  Othersfail within a few years of service.  Several factors combine to affect battery life; examples arelisted below.3.2.1.2.1. Design life.  Stationary batteries are typically available with a design life rangingfrom 5 to 20 years.   Longer life batteries generally cost more.3.2.1.2.2. Temperature.  Elevated temperatures reduce battery life.  An increase of 8.3°C(15°F) can reduce lead-acid battery life by 50% or more.3.2.1.2.3. Cycle service.  Excessive deep discharge cycles reduce life.  Lead calcium batteriesmight be rated for as few as 50 deep discharge cycles.3.2.1.2.4. Overcharging.  Excessively high float voltages cause a higher positive plate corro-sion rate.  Overcharging also causes excessive gassing.3.2.1.2.5. Undercharging.  A low float voltage reduces capacity because of self-discharge.Undercharging can also result in sulfation, which can damage the plates.3.2.1.2.6. DC ripple current.  Excessive DC ripple current might contribute to battery aging.VRLA batteries are considered more susceptible to ripple current than vented lead-acid batter-ies.3.2.1.2.7. Manufacturing variations.  Lot-to-lot processing variations can shorten battery life.3.2.1.2.8. Improper storage.  Storing wet cells beyond the manufacturer’s recommended dura-tion promotes sulfation, and decreases cell capacity and life.AFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 1999293.2.1.2.9. Misapplications.  Batteries are commonly designed for a specific use.  If the batteryis not designed for a given application, it might not meet its life or performance expectations.3.2.1.3. If properly designed, built, and maintained, a battery can provide several years of reliableservice.  The ideal profile of capacity during a lead-acid battery’s operational life is shown in fig-ure 3.1.  A new battery might not initially provide 100% capacity.  The capacity typicallyimproves over the first few years of service, reaches a peak, and declines until the battery reachesits end of life.  A reduction to 80% of the rated capacity is usually defined as the end of life for alead-acid battery.  Below 80%, the rate of battery deterioration accelerates, and it is more prone tosudden failure resulting from a mechanical shock (such as a seismic event) or a high dischargerate.  Note that even under ideal conditions, a battery is expected to eventually wear out.Figure 3.1. Ideal Battery Life Curve.3.2.1.4. Figure 3.1. shows the ideal life curve for a lead-acid battery.  The aging factors discussedabove can combine so that the battery never attains 100% capacity.  The effects can be dramatic;for example, a battery with an advertised life of 20 years can fail in less than 4 years in a harshenvironment without proper maintenance.  Figure 3.2. shows how the actual life can vary from theideal case. 30AFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 1999Figure 3.2. Possible Variations From the Ideal Battery Life Curve.3.2.1.5. RLA battery technology has come a long way in the last 15 years; however, it is stilldeveloping and the degradation mechanisms are still not fully understood.  What is known so faris that, in general, these batteries will fail before vented batteries if exposed to the same serviceconditions and environment.  VRLA batteries usually have a much tighter operating window thantheir vented counterparts, making them more prone to degradation.  VRLA batteries are also muchless tolerant of the following conditions:3.2.1.5.1. High temperature3.2.1.5.2. Overcharge3.2.1.5.3. Float voltage variations3.2.1.5.4. Discharge3.2.1.6. Section 3.3. provides information regarding VRLA failure modes.3.2.2. Temperature Effects:3.2.2.1. Anticipated battery life is specified by the manufacturer for batteries installed in an envi-ronment at or near the reference temperature of 25°C (77°F).  Above this temperature, battery lifeis reduced.  The chief aging mechanism is accelerated corrosion of the positive plates, grid struc-ture, and strap, which increases exponentially as a function of temperature.  3.2.2.2. A general rule of thumb for a vented lead-acid battery is that the battery life is halved forevery 8.3°C (15°F) above 25°C (77°F).  Thus, a battery rated for 20 years of operation under idealAFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 199931conditions at 25°C (77°F) might only last 10 years at 35°C (95°F).  Figure 3.3. shows the typicalexpected reduction in service life as a function of temperature.Figure 3.3. Temperature Effect on Lead-Acid Battery Life.3.2.3. Discharge Cycle Service:3.2.3.1. Battery failure rates, as defined by a loss of capacity and the corrosion of the positiveplates, increase with the number of discharge cycles and the depth of discharge.  Lead-acid batter-ies having lead calcium grid structures are particularly susceptible to aging due to repeatedcycling.3.2.3.2. A deep discharge cycle is defined as any discharge over 80% of the rated capacity.  Somemanufacturers provide warranties on lead calcium batteries based on the number of deep dischargecycles or the frequency of shallower discharge cycles.3.2.4. Overcharging:3.2.4.1. Overcharging accelerates corrosion of the positive plate grids and produces excessivegassing, which can loosen active material in the plates.  Active material that becomes loose cancause mossing and excessive sediment buildup.3.2.4.2. Occasional charging at higher voltages, such as an equalizing charge, can benefit the bat-tery by removing plate sulfation and refreshing the plates.  However, habitual overcharging dam-ages the plates.3.2.5. Undercharging:32AFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 19993.2.5.1. Batteries lose capacity because of self-discharge if they are consistently undercharged.An undercharge condition is indicated by a low specific gravity, low cell voltage, or lighter coloron the plates.  An undercharged battery might not be at full capacity and can become permanentlydamaged from sulfation.3.2.5.2. Chronic undercharging results in a harmful buildup of lead sulfate on the plates, calledsulfation.  Lead sulfate formed as a result of undercharging is inherently different in structure fromlead sulfate formed during normal cell discharge.  The lead sulfate formed during normal dis-charge has a very fine crystalline structure that is easily broken down by charging current.  Thelead sulfate crystals formed as a result of undercharging continue to grow and eventually reach asize that cannot be easily broken down by charge current.  Additionally, the lead sulfate crystalsphysically occupy more space than the original active material.  An excessive buildup of lead sul-fate can make the plates warp or buckle.3.2.6. Overdischarge:3.2.6.1. Hydration occurs in a lead-acid battery that is overdischarged and not promptlyrecharged, or a battery that remains in a discharged condition for an extended time (such as mightoccur during long-term storage).  Hydration results when the lead and lead compounds of theplates dissolve in the water of a discharged cell and form lead hydrate, which is deposited on theseparators.  When the cell is recharged, multiple internal short circuits occur between the positiveand negative plates.3.2.6.2. Once hydration is evident, the cell is permanently damaged.  Hydration is visible in trans-parent vented cells as a white “bathtub ring” approximately halfway up the jar.  Hydration is notvisible in VRLA cells because the containers are opaque.3.3. VRLA Battery Failure Modes:3.3.1. Dryout:3.3.1.1. Loss of water from a VRLA cell is irreversible in most designs.  As a VRLA cell loseswater, it can experience loss of capacity due to dryout.  Water addition is not normally allowed bythe VRLA design.  These batteries have been referred to as starved electrolyte, meaning that thedischarge capacity can be limited by the electrolyte.  In this case, any loss of electrolyte canadversely affect capacity.  A vented battery is expected to require periodic watering to restore lostwater; however, any water loss from a VRLA battery is irreversible because water cannot nor-mally be added to the cell.  One study determined that a 10% water loss could correlate to a 20%loss of capacity.  Any water loss from a VRLA cell is cause for concern.3.3.1.2. The recombination process tends to be somewhat self-regulating in that recombinationefficiency tends to improve as water is lost.  In theory, a VRLA cell would lose water until itreached optimal recombination efficiency, with little water loss thereafter.  However, other effectsthat occur during normal and abnormal operation also cause water loss:3.3.1.2.1. Overcharging.  This results in gassing that exceeds the recombination ability of thebattery.  Thus, gases are vented from the battery through the pressure relief valve and the vol-ume of the electrolyte solution declines over time.  Small amounts of gas are vented duringnormal float operation.  Larger gas quantities are vented during higher charging rates, such asan equalize charge.  Battery charger setpoint drift or failure can also cause increased gas vent-ing.AFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 1999333.3.1.2.2. Corrosion process.  The grid corrosion process that occurs during normal aging of alead-acid battery consumes part of the water in the electrolyte throughout the cell’s operationallife.  One study showed that this normal aging process alone could consume enough of theelectrolyte water to limit capacity.3.3.1.2.3. High temperature.  The gassing rate increases with temperature.  At high tempera-ture, some gases are vented rather than recombined inside the cell.3.3.1.2.4. Failure of the pressure relief valve.  A failure of the valve to fully shut causes thebattery to operate like a vented cell; it continuously vents.  Charge gases are then allowed toescape and the recombination process is ineffective.  3.3.1.2.5. Water vapor diffusion through the container.  As the temperature increases, thewater vapor diffusion rate through the cell container also increases.  The diffusion rate varieswith the type and thickness of container materials, operating temperature, and relative humid-ity around the cell.  Most manufacturers have selected container materials that minimize watervapor diffusion.3.3.1.2.6. Leakage.  A cracked battery case or failed terminal post seal is similar to failure ofthe pressure relief valve; the cell can continuously vent.3.3.1.3. Two of the above causes of dryout—pressure relief valve failure and container leakage—actually represent another potential failure mode for a VRLA battery.  The recombination processcauses the negative plate to be maintained in an almost depolarized condition.  Air in-leakagethrough a pressure relief valve, post seal leak, or container crack can cause eventual discharge ofthe negative plate.  The cell will lose capacity as the negative plate discharges.3.3.2. Thermal Runaway:3.3.2.1. Thermal runaway is a failure mode in which a battery on a constant voltage charge at anelevated temperature destroys itself through internal heat generation due to high internal current.Under normal operating conditions, a VRLA battery on a float charge remains in a fully chargedcondition and most gases that are produced are recombined internally.  Any overcharge energyresults in heat generation.  If the design of the battery in conjunction with its installed location issuch that the generated heat can be dissipated without a rise in the battery temperature, thermalrunaway is unlikely.  However, if the battery temperature increases, higher current is required tokeep the float voltage at the set level.  The additional current results in more gas generation insidethe cell, which generates more heat during recombination and further raises the battery tempera-ture.  If the situation is not corrected, the battery can overheat and destroy itself.  The thermal run-away sequence is shown in figure 3.4.34AFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 1999Figure 3.4. Thermal Runaway Sequence.3.3.2.2. The design of VRLA batteries increases the probability of thermal runaway.  Actually,thermal runaway can occur even in vented lead-acid batteries, but does so only rarely because oftheir better heat dissipation capability.  In general, vented cells have the best heat dissipation char-acteristics, followed in order by gelled electrolyte cells and absorbed electrolyte cells.  Inadequateheat dissipation is compounded by the installation design.  Vented batteries are usually installedwith some separation between cells, whereas VRLA batteries are often packed into the smallestpossible footprint, and so have restricted airflow around the cells.  In recent years, manufacturershave improved VRLA installations by including more air space around each cell.3.3.2.3. Improper float voltage appears to be the greatest contributor to thermal runaway.  Ahigher than recommended float voltage results in greater float current and thus battery overheat-ing.  The initial battery temperature influences the speed at which thermal runaway can occur;however, an improper float current and voltage alone can cause thermal runaway.  3.3.3. Complexity of the Recombination Process:3.3.3.1. Although the principle of the recombination process might be conceptually simple for theuser to understand, the actual implementation in a VRLA cell is quite complex.  A delicate balanceis maintained at the negative plates between oxygen recombination, hydrogen evolution, and platesulfation.  This complexity places stricter constraints on the design, manufacture, application, anduse of these cells compared to an equivalent vented cell.  VRLA batteries are more sensitive tofloat voltage variations.  The proper float voltage is necessary to maintain each cell within theproper operating range.  If the float voltage is too low, the negative plates might be undercharged,leading to capacity loss.  If the float voltage is too high, the aging process will be accelerated andthe rate of dryout will increase.AFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 1999353.3.3.2. Figure 2.9. shows the typical polarization voltage of a VRLA cell.  As can be seen, verylittle polarization voltage is applied to the negative plates under normal conditions.  The chargingcurrent must be abnormally high before significant negative plate polarization is realized.  Thislow level of polarization means that the negative plates can experience a loss of capacity over timeby partially discharging if the level of polarization is inadequate to prevent self-discharge.3.3.3.3..If the charging voltage is too high, the negative plate polarizes and the cell performs sim-ilar to a vented cell, with the negative plate also producing hydrogen.  At this point, the rate of gasproduction exceeds the recombination ability of the cell and it will periodically vent gas throughthe pressure relief valve to relieve the internal pressure.3.3.3.4. If the float voltage (and float current) is too high, the life of a VRLA cell will also bereduced, partly because of accelerated aging of the positive plate by the higher float current andpartly because of the increased rate of internal dryout by more frequent gas venting.  For this rea-son, the manufacturer typically specifies a maximum allowable float voltage and some manufac-turers set limits on the frequency and duration of periodic equalizing charges.  One manufacturer’soperating manual predicts a 50% reduction in battery life if float voltage is continuously 2 mVabove the specified range, and a 75% reduction in battery life if float voltage is continuously 6 mVabove the specified range.3.3.4. Temperature Effects:3.3.4.1. VRLA batteries tend to be more susceptible to degradation and accelerated aging athigher temperatures than are vented lead-acid batteries.  The recombination process that allowsthese batteries to operate without the need for water addition also releases heat.  Older VRLAinstallations tend to have the cells tightly packed, further limiting heat dissipation capability.  InUPS applications, these batteries are often enclosed inside a cabinet with little allowance providedfor heat dissipation.  All of these factors can combine to cause the battery to operate at ahigher-than-ambient temperature, thereby decreasing its life.  Higher temperatures also increasethe rate of dryout and increase the susceptibility to thermal runaway.  Abnormally high tempera-tures can cause a VRLA cell to fail completely.3.3.5. Electrolyte Concentration:3.3.5.1. The electrolyte in VRLA cells is a limited resource that can not normally be replenished.Any loss of electrolyte during normal and abnormal operating conditions can reduce capacity.  Insome cases, manufacturers have attempted to improve capacity by increasing the electrolyte spe-cific gravity up to 1.300 (typical vented batteries have a specific gravity of 1.215 to 1.240).Increasing the specific gravity increases capacity at the expense of cell life.  A higher specificgravity results in increased chemical activity, thereby causing an increased positive plate corrosionrate.3.3.6. Absorbed Glass Mat Compression Effects:3.3.6.1. VRLA batteries of the AGM design can experience changes in the mat position over timeresulting in loss of compression between the mat and the plates.  Compression between theabsorbed glass mat and the plates is necessary to ensure that the plates are in constant contact withthe electrolyte.  Over time, small voids can develop between the mat and the plates, increasing theinternal resistance and decreasing the available capacity.  This effect is referred to as loss of com-pression and causes a permanent loss of capacity in an AGM cell.  This loss of compression can becaused by manufacturing errors, improper design or design tolerances, and dryout.  In particular,36AFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 1999the design and manufacturing process have been important contributors to loss of compressionbecause battery manufacturers did not fully appreciate the importance of compression on the per-formance of a cell.  Dryout is an inevitable aging effect that also changes the level of compressionover a cell’s service life.3.3.7. Negative Strap Corrosion:3.3.7.1..Some VRLA batteries have shown a tendency for the negative plate straps to corrode andfail prematurely.  In an AGM VRLA cell, the negative strap is not immersed in the electrolyte;instead, it is exposed to a nearly pure hydrogen environment in the void space above the plates.With the negative strap exposed and the negative plates normally depolarized by the recombina-tion process, the negative strap can experience sulfation that ultimately leads to its fracture andfailure.  Some manufacturers have redesigned their batteries to be more resistant to negative strapcorrosion.  Design changes have included wrapping the negative strap with absorbed glass matmaterial to help keep it wetted or more carefully matching the grip, strap, and post alloys.3.3.8. VRLA Failure Characteristics:3.3.8.1. Although it is a type of lead-acid battery, the VRLA battery is distinctly different from avented lead-acid battery with regard to how it ages, degrades, and ultimately fails.  The variousfailure modes described in the previous sections readily demonstrate these differences.  Accord-ingly, VRLA cell failures tend to show up differently than do vented cell failures.  A high-qualityvented lead-acid battery tends to have its cells age at about the same rate.  When periodic dis-charge tests are performed, it is not uncommon to find that all of the vented cells perform in a verysimilar manner during discharge.  VRLA cells tend to exhibit a different behavior during dis-charge.  Although many of the cells might perform quite well, some of the cells often randomlyfail, with rapid voltage decline during discharge.3.3.8.2. What this means for those users that perform periodic discharge tests is that a capacitytest becomes more of a tool to find bad cells rather than a trending tool to determine overall batterycapacity.  Failed cells obviously require replacement; however, cell replacement can lead to otherproblems also.  Refer to the previous discussion regarding the complexity of the recombinationprocess; new replacement cells will usually have different float characteristics than the older cellsalready in service.  Some battery manufacturers’ literature attempts to address this inherent limita-tion of float charge behavior with the following recommendations:3.3.8.2.1. Minimize the number of cells in series to reduce the likelihood that some cells areundercharged while other cells are overcharged.3.3.8.2.2. Use cells of the same age and type in each string.3.3.8.2.3. Avoid installing the battery near hot spots (or any location that can cause a temper-ature differential across the battery).3.3.8.2.4. If necessary, break up the string into smaller charging groups (seldom done for sta-tionary applications).3.3.8.3. Although the above recommendations are well intended, they are not always achievablein the field.  For example, replacement cells for failed cells will be of a different age than theremaining already installed cells.  This will contribute to float voltage variations, but cannot beavoided because replacement cells are required.  Usually, replacing the entire battery just becausea few cells failed is not acceptable from a budget perspective.  As more cells are replaced withAFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 199937each year, the chances of having equal float characteristics across the battery become less and lessprobable.  Figure 3.5. shows an extreme case of float voltage variations; notice that some cells arebelow the desired charging voltage while other cells are overcharged to the point of extreme gas-sing.  Note that none of the cells are operated at the manufacturer’s recommended float voltage of2.25 V per cell.Figure 3.5. Float Voltage Variation Observed at One Site.3.3.8.4. Many VRLA batteries are installed throughout the world and the industry is beginning toacknowledge that a 20 year VRLA battery life is unlikely to realize.  Recent industry experienceindicates that a 4 to 7 year VRLA battery life is more likely, regardless of cell size or warrantyclaims.  3.3.8.5. In one study of almost 25,000 VRLA cells from 9 different manufacturers, the failurerates ranged from 27% to 86%, depending on the manufacturer.  These cells were only 3 to 7 yearsold.  The average failure rate was 64% for the entire tested population.  This study concluded thatthe failures were generic and appeared to be independent of size or manufacturer over a rangefrom 25 to 1,000 ampere-hours.3.3.8.6. A European study of over 1,000 installations, of various system voltages and cell capaci-ties, containing about 35,000 cells concluded that VRLA batteries require replacement after 5 to 8years of operation.  The shorter lifetime (5 years) was associated with batteries operating at 110 Vor higher system voltages.  The longer lifetime (up to 8 years) was applicable to better quality bat-teries and those of lower system voltages.  AGM-type cells demonstrated a higher failure rate thandid gel-type cells.  No single or systematic factor was determined to cause this short lifetime.3.3.8.7. Representatives of a major battery company recently provided an update regardingVRLA cells’ expected life.  Four different VRLA cells were tested, including three different AGMtypes and one gel-type.  It was concluded that 20-year class AGM cells actually have an expectedlife of 5 years at 25°C (77°F), dropping to about 3 years at 32°C (90°F).38AFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 19993.3.8.8. In summary, VRLA batteries can have a shorter-than-advertised life and some manufac-turers have acknowledged this limitation.  With each generation, VRLA batteries will likely con-tinue to improve.  However, their greatest strengths that make them so popular for use are alsotheir greatest weaknesses in terms of the user’s ability to identify cell failures.AFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 199939INDUSTRY STANDARDS APPLICABLE TO VRLA BATTERIESChapter 4  4.1. Introduction:4.1.1. The Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) provides comprehensive guidancefor stationary batteries.  IEEE has issued three standards to address the particular needs of VRLA bat-teries, including application, selection, installation, maintenance, and testing.  Each standard isdescribed in the following sections.  The purpose of discussing these standards is to provide an over-view of the type of inspection, testing, and maintenance that has been recommended by industryexperts.  The issues addressed by these IEEE standards have been considered in the development ofthis manual.4.2. IEEE 1187-1996:4.2.1. IEEE 1187-1996, IEEE Recommended Practice for Installation Design and Installation ofValve-Regulated Lead Acid Storage Batteries for Stationary Applications, provides recommendationsfor the design and initial installation of a VRLA battery.

This recommended practice represents animportant contribution to the industry by providing specific maintenance recommendations for VRLAbatteries.  The following topics are discussed in this recommended practice.40AFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 19994.3.1.1. Safety precautions4.3.1.2. Monthly general inspections:4.3.1.2.1.

In several instances, the above recommendations represent a significant departure from tradi-tional maintenance for vented batteries as well as from the recommended maintenance contained insome battery manufacturers’ operating manuals.  In particular, the scope and frequency of inspectionsand tests have been increased. 4.4. Other IEEE Standards:4.4.1. IEEE 1189, Guide for Selection of Valve Regulated Lead-Acid Storage Batteries for StationaryApplications, provides information related to VRLA technology and should be considered a compan-ion document to IEEE 1187 and IEEE 1188.  Although maintenance information is not provided inthis document, it does describe the technology in some detail.  4.4.2. IEEE 1184, IEEE Guide for the Selection and Sizing of Batteries for Uninterruptible PowerSystems, also provides technical information related to selection and use of VRLA batteries.42AFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 1999Chapter 5 APPLICATION CONSIDERATIONS 5.1. VRLA Battery Desirable Features. The VRLA battery is an innovative design with many usefulapplications.  It is effectively sealed such that the user can not gain access to the electrolyte.  And, theelectrolyte is immobilized so that it is not a free liquid as in a vented cell, with the result that a VRLA cellwill usually leak little or no electrolyte if damaged.  When they were first developed, VRLA batterieswere intended for “install and forget” truly maintenance-free applications in which battery failure wouldbe an inconvenience, not a catastrophe.  Because of some of their desirable design features, VRLA batter-ies are becoming increasingly used in stationary battery systems to the point that they are now commonlyfound in critical applications.  The VRLA battery market has grown to fill the demand for a battery withthe following characteristics:5.1.1. Immobilized electrolyte to prevent or minimize the potential for electrolyte leakage.  Thisallows users to avoid the imposition of some environmental regulations regarding sulfuric acid spillcontingencies in some states.  This also allows users to install batteries in commercial buildings andother locations that would not normally have vented batteries installed.5.1.2. Smaller installation footprints than vented equivalents.  By immobilizing the electrolyte, thebattery can be installed in different configurations.  A typical installation has the VRLA cells orientedon their side rather than upright so that they can be stacked vertically.  The result is that less floorspace is required for the installation.5.1.3. No maintenance.  Because the battery is sealed and the electrolyte is inaccessible, water can notbe added to a VRLA cell.  This feature was referred to as maintenance-free in early literature; how-ever, this term is less commonly used today because other types of maintenance are still necessary.5.1.4. Higher power density for high-rate discharge UPS applications.  Manufacturers have devel-oped new designs and electrolyte concentrations to boost the high-rate capability.5.2. Allowed Applications. VRLA batteries are allowed to be used in the following general types ofapplications:5.2.1. Installations with small footprints such that a vented battery will not fit within the availablespace.5.2.2. Locations in which the consequences of electrolyte leakage cannot be allowed.  For example,commercial buildings cannot tolerate the consequences of electrolyte leakage into the internal wiringspaces between floors.  A vented lead-acid cell can leak all of its electrolyte if the container fails; aVRLA battery will have little or no leakage upon container failure.5.2.3. Installations in which the power density requirement exceeds the capability of a vented batterywithin the allowed footprint.5.3. Excluded Applications. Just as VRLA batteries have applications in which they will be preferen-tially used, there are also applications in which their use should be avoided.  Do not use VRLA batteriesin the following general types of applications:5.3.1. Unregulated environments that can experience abnormally high and low temperatures.AFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 1999435.3.2. Unmonitored locations that seldom receive periodic maintenance checks.5.3.3. Critical applications, unless the system design requires the features available only in a VRLAbattery.5.4. Vented Lead-Acid Batteries. As a general practice, do not use a VRLA battery if a vented lead-acidbattery will satisfy the design requirements.  VRLA batteries have exhibited a shorter service life thanvented equivalents and have shown a tendency to fail without warning.  A life-cycle analysis will usuallyselect a vented lead-acid battery over a VRLA battery if actual expected lifetimes are used.5.5. Monitoring and Maintenance. If the application requires the use of a VRLA battery, the periodicmonitoring and maintenance requirements of this manual must be followed.44AFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 1999Chapter 6 PERSONNEL AND EQUIPMENT SAFETY6.1. General Precautions:6.1.1. Batteries and DC system components are different from AC electrical system equipment.  Bat-teries contain acid, which is harmful to skin and eyes, and the electrical shock hazards associated withDC power can be more severe than those associated with AC power for equivalent voltages and cur-rents.6.1.2. Only authorized personnel who have been familiarized and trained on battery fundamentalsand maintenance procedures are allowed to perform maintenance-related activities on a battery.6.1.3. The following equipment shall be available for the safe handling of the battery and protectionof personnel:6.1.3.1. Safety glasses with side shields, goggles, and/or face shields6.1.3.2. Acid-resistance gloves6.1.3.3. Protective aprons and safety shoes6.1.3.4. Portable or stationary water facilities for rinsing eyes and skin in case of contact with acidelectrolyte6.1.3.5. Class C fire extinguisher6.1.3.6. Bicarbonate of soda to neutralize any acid spillage (0.1 kg/L or 1 lb/gal of water)6.1.3.7. Adequately insulated tools6.1.3.8. Lifting devices of adequate capacity, when required6.2. Explosion Hazards:6.2.1. Hydrogen and oxygen gases can be released from a battery during operation.  Oxygen is gener-ated at the positive plate and hydrogen is generated at the negative plate.  Gases are created primarilyduring battery charging; the rate of gas evolution depends on the charge voltage and the charge currentthat is not absorbed by the battery.  The excess charge current causes electrolysis of the water in theelectrolyte into hydrogen and oxygen.6.2.2. Overcharge is the period after which the battery is fully charged and charging current mainlyresults in gas generation.  The worst condition for hydrogen generation exists when maximum currentis forced into a fully charged battery.  Charging voltages at or above the equalizing charge levelencourage gas evolution.6.2.3. VRLA batteries are a potential source of hydrogen gas.  Under normal operating conditionswith a VRLA cell recombining gases internally, very little hydrogen gas is generated.  However, dur-ing equalize charge conditions, the rate of hydrogen gas generation can exceed the recombinationability of the cell, resulting in hydrogen venting through the pressure relief valve.  Drift in the chargeroutput voltage can also cause the battery voltage to be higher than normal.  For these reasons, VRLAcells should be designed as if they will periodically vent hydrogen gas.  The following summarizes thepotential for hydrogen generation under different operating conditions:AFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 1999456.2.3.1. Open circuit—Virtually no gas emission6.2.3.2. Float charge—Minimal gas emission6.2.3.3. Equalize charge and recharge—Potential for high gas emission6.2.3.4. Discharge—Virtually no gas emission6.2.4. Because of the electrochemical behavior of a VRLA cell, the space above the plates inside thecell contains almost entirely hydrogen gas.  Any vented gas from a VRLA cell likely contains a highhydrogen percentage.6.2.5. Cells are equipped with flame arresters designed to allow gases to escape the battery while pre-venting external sparks from igniting any gases inside the battery.  A 4% hydrogen concentration isflammable.  The ventilation system in a battery area should be designed to keep hydrogen concentra-tion under 2%.6.3. Short Circuit Hazards:6.3.1. Personnel can become complacent when working around batteries.  DC systems are often mis-takenly considered to operate at innocent voltages.  But, DC current represents a more severe shockhazard than an equivalent AC current because the current has no zero crossing, thus making it harderto break away from an electrical shock.  Batteries can produce lethal currents.  Also, the effects of ashort circuit across battery terminals can create other personnel and equipment hazards, includingdamage from vaporized or molten metal fragments, and flash burn damage to the skin and eyes.6.3.2. Because of the potential for personnel injury, the following safety precautions are required: 6.3.2.1. Wear proper safety clothing to prevent contact with acid or live electrical connections.Whenever working around batteries, wear a rubber apron and rubber gloves.  Ensure goggles andface shields are available for personnel.6.3.2.2. Use only insulated tools in the battery area to prevent accidental shorting across batteryconnections.  Never lay tools or other metal objects on cells; shorting, explosion, or personalinjury could result.  As a general rule, the length of the exposed metal for any tool should be lessthan the distance between the positive and negative posts of each cell. 6.3.2.3. Wear only nonconductive hard hats near batteries.  Metal hard hats can fall across the bat-tery terminals or connections and create short circuits.6.3.2.4. Remove all jewelry, wristwatches, or clothing with metal parts that could come into con-tact with the battery terminals.  6.3.2.5. Do not make or break series connections within an operating group of cells.  Before pro-ceeding, open the battery system circuit breaker to minimize the possibility of arcing.  6.3.2.6. Because batteries can generate hydrogen gas that, in sufficient concentrations, can beexplosive if ignited, never bring burning materials such as lighted matches, cigarettes, or sparks ofany kind near the battery.  Avoid the use of spark-producing equipment near batteries.  Residualgases can remain within cells during storage and shipment.  Take these precautions at all timeswhile handling batteries.6.3.2.7. Ensure that the exit from the battery area is unobstructed.6.3.2.8. Minimize access to the battery by personnel unaware of battery safety precautions.46AFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 1999Chapter 7 PERIODIC MAINTENANCE7.1. VRLA Battery Inspections That Can and Cannot Be Performed:7.1.1. All stationary batteries require periodic inspection and maintenance.  Older literature fromsome battery manufacturers refers to VRLA batteries as maintenance free.  Many users misinterpretedthis terminology; the term maintenance free only meant that electrolyte checks could not be per-formed, other maintenance is still required.  Because of their design, not all of the traditional inspec-tions performed on vented lead-acid batteries can be performed on VRLA batteries.  The followinginspections and maintenance that would periodically be performed on a vented cell cannot be per-formed on a VRLA cell:7.1.1.1. Electrolyte level checks.  The electrolyte level can not be checked in a VRLA cell; theelectrolyte is suspended in microporous mats or a gel surrounding the plates.  Access to the elec-trolyte is not allowed.7.1.1.2. Water addition.  Water can not normally be added to a VRLA cell.  The access port issealed by a pressure relief valve.  Furthermore, the cells are often installed on their side that wouldcomplicate water addition even if access was allowed.7.1.1.3. Visual internal inspection.  The opaque container of a VRLA cell does not allow for acheck of the sediment space, or color and condition of the plates.7.1.2. The electrolyte checks and visual inspection are valuable for vented lead-acid batteries.  Justbecause these checks cannot be performed on a VRLA cell does not mean that the checks are notimportant.  Other means of assessing the interior of a VRLA cell have been developed to compensatefor the inability to perform electrolyte checks and the internal visual inspection.7.1.3. The following general checks can still be performed on VRLA batteries:7.1.3.1. External visual inspection7.1.3.2. Float voltage checks7.1.3.3. ntercell connection integrity7.1.4. In addition to the above checks, technology has been developed to monitor each cell’s internalresistance.  The quarterly inspections described in Section 7.3. provide additional information regard-ing this relatively new technology and its role in VRLA battery maintenance.7.1.5. The following sections describe how the above checks are integrated into a periodic mainte-nance program.7.2. Monthly Inspection:7.2.1. Purpose of Inspection:7.2.1.1. The purpose of the monthly inspection is to assess the general condition of the battery andbattery area.  This monthly inspection is intended to be a general quick check for the more con-spicuous problems that can be encountered.  The following types of battery degradation can bedetected during the monthly inspection:AFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 1999477.2.1.1.1. Abnormal battery area ambient temperature (high temperature can reduce batterylife and contribute to dryout)7.2.1.1.2. Improper operation of the battery area ventilation system7.2.1.1.3. Improper float voltage7.2.1.1.4. Electrolyte leakage from pressure relief valve, cracked container, or post seal7.2.2. Inspection Procedure:WARNING:  Observe safety precautions for working with energized DC equipment and batteries. NOTE: Whenever performing maintenance inspections, ensure that the manufacturers’ instruction man-uals for the battery and charger are available for review.7.2.2.1. Verify that the battery area safety equipment is available and operational.  This includesthe eye wash station, shower, and fire extinguisher, as applicable.7.2.2.2. Verify that personal safety equipment is available and in good condition.  This includesgoggles, face shields, plastic or rubber aprons, and gloves.7.2.2.3. Verify that battery cleaning and acid neutralization supplies are available.  Baking soda,water, a nonconductive container for mixing, and wiping cloths are recommended.CAUTION:  Use only clean water for cleaning battery components.  Solvents and greases can damage the cell containers.  Follow the manufacturer’s instruc-tions closely to avoid inadvertent harm to the battery.7.2.2.4. Visually inspect the battery area for cleanliness.  Assure that the area is dry and clear ofdebris.7.2.2.5. Measure and record the battery area ambient temperature.  The desired temperatureshould be in the range of 21°C (70°F) to 27°C (80°F).NOTES:If the battery is located in an enclosure, the ambient temperature should be measured inside the enclo-sure, not in the surrounding area.Extended operation at a high temperature shortens battery life.  In general, VRLA battery life isreduced by at least 50% for every 8.3°C (15°F) of continuous operation above 25°C (77°F).  At veryhigh temperatures, VRLA batteries are also more susceptible to other failure modes such as dryout orthermal runaway.If a battery is normally maintained at a temperature significantly different than 25°C (77°F), verify thatthe float voltage is set in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations.7.2.2.6. Verify that the battery area ventilation system is operating by checking for airflowthrough the ventilation exhaust ducts.  If the battery is enclosed in a cabinet, ensure that the cabi-net ventilation is working properly (if so equipped) and that ventilation panels are not blocked.48AFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 1999WARNING: Inadequate ventilation can result in the dangerous buildup of hydrogen gas.7.2.2.7. Visually inspect all cell jars or battery modules, and the battery rack for cleanliness andany signs of distortion or damage.7.2.2.8. Verify that the cells have protective covers in place to minimize short circuit safety haz-ards.  Figure 2.7. shows an example of a VRLA installation with and without the protective cov-ers.7.2.2.9. Visually check for cracks or signs of electrolyte leakage in each cell.  Check for signs ofelectrolyte leakage from the pressure relief valve in each cell.  Inspect the flooring below the cellsfor symptoms of past leakage.  Figure 7.1. shows an example of floor corrosion caused by electro-lyte leakage.  If electrolyte leakage is observed, contact the manufacturer to determine if the cellsrequire replacement.  Electrolyte leakage can cause a loss of capacity and can lead to other VRLAfailure modes.Figure 7.1. Signs of Electrolyte Leakage From a VRLA Battery.7.2.2.10. Visually inspect the cell posts for corrosion and damage.  Wipe off any signs of corro-sion from the posts.  Regrease the post with anticorrosion grease, if necessary.  Corrosion on thecell posts can indicate a loss of post seal integrity, which can result in rapid dryout and failure of aVRLA battery.  Consult with the manufacturer if post seal failure is suspected.7.2.2.11. Verify that the voltmeter calibration has not expired.  Use a calibrated voltmeter with anaccuracy of at least 0.5% of the measured voltage.  Assure that the voltmeter test leads are wellAFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 199949insulated and securely attached to the meter to prevent their falling onto a cell and causing a shortcircuit.CAUTION:  Because float voltages are accurate cell indicators only when taken on a fully charged battery, be sure that at least 72 hours have elapsed since the system was discharged or equalized.7.2.2.12. Record the charger output voltage and current.  Verify that the output voltage is withinthe desired range.CAUTION:Observe the proper polarity when taking voltage measurements to avoid positive and negative calibration differences in the voltmeter.7.2.2.13. Measure and record the voltage at the battery terminals.  Divide this measurement by thenumber of cells in the battery to confirm that the average individual cell voltage is within the rangerecommended by the manufacturer.7.2.2.14. If float voltage is outside the recommended range, adjust the charger output to the rec-ommended value in accordance with facility procedures.7.3. Quarterly Inspection:7.3.1. Purpose of Inspection:7.3.1.1. The quarterly inspection provides confirmation that the battery and individual cells arebeing maintained within recommended operating limits.  Also, the quarterly inspection for aVRLA battery is intended to confirm that excessive internal battery degradation has not occurred.The following checks are specified on a quarterly basis:7.3.1.1.1. Monthly inspection as described in Section 7.2, except the float voltage checks areperformed on all cells7.3.1.1.2. Cell internal ohmic measurements7.3.1.1.3. Temperature of the negative terminal of each cell7.3.1.2. Cell internal ohmic measurements are intended to identify degraded or failed cells.  Sec-tion 7.3.2. provides additional information regarding these measurements.7.3.1.3. A check of cell temperature is prudent because a high cell temperature can indicate any ofthe following potential problems:7.3.1.3.1. High temperatures reduce battery life by accelerating the internal corrosion rate.  Acommon rule of thumb for vented lead-acid batteries is that a 8.3°C (15°F) rise in temperaturedecreases the expected life by 50%.  For the same temperature rise, a VRLA battery experi-ences at least the same life reduction as a vented cell.7.3.1.3.2. High battery temperatures can contribute to thermal runaway, a condition in whicha battery on a constant voltage charge at an elevated temperature destroys itself through inter-nal heat generation due to high internal current.  7.3.1.3.3. If the float voltage is too high for the actual cell temperature, the cell will be over-charged, leading to internal gassing and periodic venting of gases through the pressure relief50AFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 1999valve.  A VRLA battery can suffer from thermal runaway due to overcharge at high tempera-tures.7.3.1.3.4. A cell (or group of cells) with an abnormally high temperature in comparison toother cells can indicate that significant dryout has occurred or that a localized temperature dis-sipation problem exists.7.3.2. Internal Ohmic Measurements Background Information:7.3.2.1. Internal ohmic measurements are taken to determine the internal resistance of a battery.An internal ohmic measurement can be obtained in different forms—resistance, impedance, orconductance.  Compared to the many decades that the lead-acid battery has been in use, the appli-cation of internal ohmic measurements is still a relatively new technology.  The following explainswhy this technology has been specified for VRLA batteries:7.3.2.1.1. VRLA batteries cannot be visually inspected internally; in vented batteries, thevisual inspection often provides early visual indication of several possible battery problems.  7.3.2.1.2. Cell voltage measurements do not indicate internal problems until significant celldamage or degradation has occurred.7.3.2.1.3. Dryout is a recognized failure mechanism for VRLA batteries.  Traditional inspec-tions are unable to detect this condition.7.3.2.1.4. VRLA batteries have shown a tendency to be more susceptible to sudden death (anunexpected failure when a load is placed on the battery) than vented lead-acid batteries.  Yet,the VRLA battery design precludes monitoring for this failure mode by conventional means.7.3.2.1.5. VRLA batteries are more sensitive to high temperature, float voltage variations,overcharge, and over-discharge than vented lead-acid batteries.  Therefore, some method ofmonitoring the internal rate of degradation has been needed.7.3.2.1.6. Other conventional battery inspections do not necessarily provide a true indicationof battery health.  For example, specific gravity and cell voltage measurements do not indicatethe available capacity.  Either of these measurements offers general information regarding thequality of the electrolyte and the adequacy of the float voltage; however, neither providesinformation regarding the internal cell conduction paths or the actual cell capacity.  In anyevent, specific gravity measurements are not possible for VRLA batteries. 7.3.2.1.7. Finally, there is no other measurement technique that offers the user any ability to“see” inside the cell.  Some type of internal monitoring is needed.  In some respects, an inter-nal ohmic measurement of a VRLA battery is a limited substitute for the visual inspection of avented lead-acid battery.7.3.2.2. Three types of internal ohmic test equipment are available, capable of measuring conduc-tance, impedance, or resistance, respectively.  The following provides a brief description of eachtype.  All three types are considered technically acceptable for use in stationary battery monitor-ing.  7.3.2.3. Conductance describes the ability of a circuit to facilitate current flow.  In a typical con-ductance test, an AC voltage of known frequency and amplitude is applied across a cell or battery,and the AC current that flows in response to the applied voltage is observed.  The measured con-ductance is the ratio of current to voltage, where the current is the component in-phase with theAFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 199951AC voltage.  The measured conductance value varies with battery manufacturer, type, and size.The Midtronics Celltron Plus is an example of a commercially available conductance tester (seefigure 7.2.).Figure 7.2. Internal Conductance Tester.7.3.2.4. A battery impedance tester capacitively couples a low-frequency current to the batteryand measures the small AC voltage drop across the battery terminals.  The voltage measurement isdivided by the AC current passing through the battery to calculate the battery impedance.  Consist-ing basically of a transmitter and receiver, an impedance tester applies an AC current to the batteryunder test.  The AC test current is applied via a series capacitor (capacitive couple) to block theDC voltage of the battery.  The receiver is clamped around a battery terminal and probes are usedto measure the AC voltage across the battery.  The instrument circuitry measures the rms currentand voltage, then computes and displays these values as an impedance (milliohm).  Figure 7.3.shows the Biddle Enhanced Battery Impedance Test Equipment (EBITE) test system.52AFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 1999Figure 7.3. Internal Impedance Tester.7.3.2.5. A battery resistance measurement is taken by monitoring the instantaneous change involtage when the battery is discharged by a specific amount.  When a load is applied to a battery,an instantaneous voltage drop occurs and, when the load is removed, a voltage recovery subse-quently occurs.  By monitoring the current and cell voltage just prior to removal of the load andthe recovered cell voltage, the internal cell resistance can be calculated by Ohm’s Law.  The AlberCellcorder resistance tester is shown in figure 7.4..  This tester provides a resistance measurementin terms of micro-ohms.Figure 7.4. Internal Resistance Tester.7.3.2.6. Each type of test equipment described above measures some form of the cell’s internalresistance.  The goal of an internal ohmic measurement is to measure changes in the internal resis-tance as the cell ages.  As a VRLA cell ages from new to end-of-life, the internal resistance isexpected to change significantly.  It is important to understand that a cell’s internal resistance canchange by a number of factors in addition to the expected aging process.  The following parame-ters affect the measured internal resistance:AFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 1999537.3.2.6.1. Natural aging and degradation.  Internal resistance increases with age.  The goal ofan internal ohmic measurement is to monitor the extent of this degradation.7.3.2.6.2. State of charge.  Internal resistance increases as a cell is discharged.  To ensure con-sistency, internal ohmic measurements should only be taken on fully charged cells while onfloat charge.7.3.2.6.3. Temperature.  To the extent possible, measurements should be taken in the range of18°C (65°F) to 29°C (85°F).  Low temperatures cause increased resistance which could appearas a degrading performance trend by internal ohmic measurements.7.3.2.6.4. Rated cell capacity.  Internal resistance tends to decrease as the cell capacity isincreased.  In general, internal ohmic measurements taken on one size cell can not be com-pared to measurements taken from another cell size.  The best method is to compare the mea-surements of all cells in a particular battery.7.3.2.6.5. Cell-to-cell variations.  Minor manufacturing and operating variations will contrib-ute to minor differences in the measured internal resistance between cells.7.3.2.6.6. Test equipment.  Each type of test equipment performs its measurement by a differ-ent technique, and at a different test frequency and applied current.  Thus, the various testinstruments will provide different readings on the same cell.  Although the different measure-ments can be correlated, they are not identical.7.3.2.6.7. Measurement uncertainty.  The test equipment calibration, rated accuracy, types oftest probes, and quality of test connection all contribute to variations in the measurement.7.3.2.7. Despite the above variations, internal ohmic measurements have demonstrated the abilityto identify failed or low capacity cells.  IEEE 1188 recommends investigating internal resistancechanges of 20% or more.  The following provides specific guidance regarding the interpretation ofinternal ohmic measurements:7.3.2.7.1. Compare measurements to the reference value (internal ohmic value of the cellwhen new) for the particular cell size and type.  The test equipment supplier or battery manu-facturer can provide information regarding the expected reference value.  Care must be takenthat the selected reference value applies to the cell under test.7.3.2.7.2. A conductance decrease >30% from the reference value likely indicates a lowcapacity cell.  A conductance decrease >40% from the reference value likely indicates a failedcell.7.3.2.7.3. An impedance or resistance increase >50% from the reference value likely indicatesa low capacity cell.  An impedance or resistance increase >80% from the reference value likelyindicates a failed cell.7.3.2.7.4. If the reference value for a particular cell type is not available, compare the internalohmic measurements for all cells in the battery under evaluation.  Even in degraded batteries,there are often good cells that still have an internal ohmic value near the reference value forthat cell type.  Estimate the reference internal ohmic value by selecting the average of the low-est impedance (or resistance) cells or the average of the highest conductance cells, dependingon the test equipment used.  Apply the guidelines described above using this estimated refer-ence value.547.3.3. Inspection Procedure:AFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 1999WARNING:  Observe safety precautions for working with energized DC equipment andbatteries.7.3.3.1. Perform the monthly inspection as specified in paragraph 7.2.7.3.3.2. Use a temperature measurement device such as an electronic meter with attached temper-ature probe to measure the temperature of each cell.  Verify that the calibration has not expired andthat the calibrated measurement accuracy meets or exceeds ±0.6°C (1°F).  Measure and recordeach cell temperature to the nearest whole degree by placing the temperature probe against thenegative terminal of each cell.WARNING:  Be sure the uninsulated portion of the temperature probe is not long enough to simultaneously touch the positive and negative posts.7.3.3.3. Investigate any higher than expected temperatures.  If any cell temperature is more than3°C (5°F) above the ambient temperature, investigate further. NOTE: High cell temperatures can contribute to thermal runaway in a VRLA battery.  Every effortshould be made to keep the cell temperatures within the design limits.7.3.3.4. Measure and record each cell float voltage.  Compare the cell voltages to the range rec-ommended by the manufacturer.  Ensure that the voltage readings are within the tolerance speci-fied by the manufacturer for the particular battery.  If any individual cell measurement exceeds themanufacturer’s recommended tolerance, investigate for abnormal conditions.7.3.3.5. In accordance with the test equipment manufacturer’s instructions, measure each cell’sinternal resistance, impedance, or conductance, as applicable.  Take the internal ohmic measure-ment with the battery in a fully charged, steady state condition while on float charge.  Readingstaken on a discharged battery or a battery undergoing recharge are not indicative of the actual con-dition of the battery.7.3.3.6. Evaluate the internal ohmic measurement taken on each cell and investigate any readingthat varies from the cell’s reference value by more than 25%.  A conductance decrease >30% fromthe reference value likely indicates a low capacity cell.  A conductance decrease >40% from thereference value likely indicates a failed cell.  An impedance or resistance increase >50% from thereference value likely indicates a low capacity cell.  An impedance or resistance increase >80%from the reference value likely indicates a failed cell.7.3.3.7. If the cell internal ohmic measurements indicate possible low capacity cells, perform oneof the following:7.3.3.7.1. Replace the cells that have poor internal ohmic values.7.3.3.7.2. Perform a capacity discharge test to confirm the low capacity cell(s); proceed fur-ther based on the capacity test results.7.3.3.7.3. Contact the battery manufacturer for guidance.7.4. Annual Inspection:AFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 19997.4.1. Purpose of Inspection:557.4.1.1. The annual inspection includes the monthly and quarterly inspections.  The additionalinspections conducted annually allow a more detailed assessment of the battery condition.  Thefollowing inspections are included in the annual inspections:7.4.1.1.1. Monthly and quarterly inspections on all cells7.4.1.1.2. Detailed cell and battery rack inspection7.4.1.1.3. Connection resistance checks7.4.1.2. Connection resistance checks are considered necessary for high-rate discharge applica-tions.  A high connection resistance can cause excessive heating or abnormal voltage drop duringdischarge, and can lead to severe damage during periods of high-rate discharge.  The integrity ofall battery electrical connections should be confirmed annually to ensure that all connections areacceptable; this inspection includes cell-to-cell (intercell) and external circuit terminations.  Theadequacy of electrical terminations is best determined by connection resistance measurements.Connections should be disassembled, cleaned, and reassembled only when resistance measure-ments indicate a high-resistance termination.7.4.2. Inspection Procedure:WARNING:Observe safety precautions for working with energized DC equip-ment and batteries.7.4.2.1. Perform the monthly and quarterly inspections as specified in paragraph 7.2. and 7.3,respectively.  Perform a detailed visual inspection of each cell to identify any signs of leakage,container cracking, or post seal failure.7.4.2.2. Perform intercell connection resistance checks in accordance with paragraph 7.4.3.  If amicro-ohmmeter is not available, check the torque of each connection in accordance with the man-ufacturer’s instructions.7.4.3. Intercell Connection Checks:7.4.3.1. The procedure provided in this section assumes that a micro-ohmmeter is available toperform the specified checks.  If this test equipment is not available, check the torque of each con-nection in accordance with the battery manufacturer’s instruction manual.7.4.3.2. Normal termination resistance varies with the battery size and termination technique.Normal resistance values can range from less than 10 micro-ohms for a large battery to well over100 micro-ohms for a small battery.  Review the battery manufacturer’s instruction manual todetermine acceptable values for a particular battery.7.4.3.3. Intercell and termination resistance values are recorded as a baseline upon initial installa-tion.  Thereafter, annual measurements are trended against the baseline data to identify any degra-dation in the battery connections.  Acceptance criteria should be established for resistance values;corrective action is required whenever the acceptance criteria are exceeded.  The urgency of thecorrective action should be based on the extent to which the measured resistance exceeds theacceptance criteria.  For example, two levels can be established:56AFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 19997.4.3.3.1. An absolute upper limit requiring immediate corrective action regardless of facilitystatus7.4.3.3.2. A lower limit requiring correction as a routine scheduled activity7.4.3.4. Connection resistance measurements are normally taken with a micro-ohmmeter.Micro-ohmmeter measurements should be recorded to the nearest micro-ohm.  Any digital read-ings in the milliohm range should be converted to micro-ohms.  For example, a reading of 0.050milliohm would be recorded as 50 micro-ohms.  The micro-ohmmeter must be calibrated andshould be accurate to within ±2 micro-ohms.7.4.3.5. Micro-ohmmeter measurements are normally limited to bolted connections.  Some man-ufacturers use multicell jars in which the internal connections are welded in place.  In this case,only the bolted connections on each end of the multicell jar are normally checked because theinternal welded connections are inaccessible.7.4.3.6. In principle, intercell measurements are always taken from the post of one cell to the postof the next cell.  The cell is not included in the measurement; the resistance check is intended todetermine the resistance of the bolted connection between the two posts.  Micro-ohmmeters arecapable of precise resistance measurements to a fraction of a micro-ohm (10-6 ohm).  Care must betaken during micro-ohmmeter measurements; figure 7.5. conceptually shows the proper test con-nection method for a micro-ohmmeter.  It is important that the micro-ohmmeter probes touch onlythe posts, not the intercell connector hardware.  The resistance of the connection between the postto the hardware is the concern, not the resistance of the connecting hardware.Figure 7.5. Proper Micro-Ohmmeter Measurement.7.4.3.7. The micro-ohmmeter is very sensitive and can be permanently damaged if connectedacross a cell.  Care must be taken to prevent the test leads from simultaneously touching the posi-tive and negative posts of a single cell, or ends of a series of cells.  7.4.3.8. Because of the many cell designs and termination methods, it is not practical to cover allpossible connection resistance configurations.  Instead, a few common methods are presented asexamples of how the measurement can be accomplished.  Maintenance personnel should reviewthe battery installations for their facility and determine the most suitable test method for each bat-tery.AFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 1999577.4.3.9. The intercell resistance measurement is simplest for cells containing one post each for thepositive and negative terminal.  The intercell connection resistance is determined by measuringthe resistance from each cell’s positive post to the next cell’s negative post (see figure 7.6.).  Thereading must be obtained with the probe actually on the post, not on the intercell connector.Figure 7.6. Single Terminal Post Resistance Measurement.7.4.3.10. Another common design has two terminal posts on each end of the cell.  The intercellconnection bolts onto both posts as shown in figure 7.7.  Because there are four posts total, taketwo measurements as follows:7.4.3.10.1. Terminal Post A to Terminal Post C7.4.3.10.2. Terminal Post B to Terminal Post DFigure 7.7. Two Terminal Post Resistance Measurement.7.4.3.11. Inter-tier or inter-rack connections are sometimes made with cables because of the dis-tance between cells.  A lug is attached to each end of the cable and the lugs are bolted onto theappropriate cell posts.  This post configuration is shown in figure 7.8.  In this case, a post-to-postmeasurement is still appropriate, but because the cable resistance is included in the measurement,termination problems can be masked by the cable resistance contribution to the measurement.58AFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 1999Figure 7.8. Cable Bolted to Terminal Post.7.4.3.12. As a minimum, record the post-to-post resistance for a simple one post cell as shown infigure 7.9.  In addition, take post-to-lug measurements at each post to remove the cable resistancefrom the measurement.  This measurement is also shown in Figure 7.9.Figure 7.9. Inter-Tier or Inter-Rack Resistance Measurement.7.4.3.13. A two post cell normally has a termination plate that bolts onto both posts.  Cables con-necting the two cells attach to the termination plate.  The method of measurement in this case isAFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 199959fundamentally the same as for the two-post cell method; post-to-post measurements are takenbetween the two cells.  In addition, post-to-lug measurements can be recorded at each cell toobtain a more accurate measure of the actual termination resistance.7.4.3.14. Some VRLA cell designs do not allow access to the post.  Taking an intercell connectionresistance measurement on the connecting hardware will be ineffective; the measurement willrecord only the resistance of the hardware, not the resistance of the connection.  In these cases,check the torque of the connections in accordance with the battery manufacturer’s instructionmanual.7.4.4. Correcting High Resistance Connections:WARNING:Observe safety precautions for working with energized DC equip-ment and batteries.7.4.4.1. If a resistance measurement exceeds the acceptance criteria, perform the following stepsbefore resorting to disassembling the connection.7.4.4.1.1. Inspect the connection for signs of corrosion.7.4.4.1.2. Check the torque of the high-resistance bolted connection.  If the connection hard-ware is a bolt and nut assembly, use two insulated wrenches to minimize stress on the connec-tion.  One of the two wrenches has to be a calibrated torque wrench.  Do not exceed themanufacturer’s recommended torque values.  Recheck the resistance measurement afterretorquing the connection.7.4.4.2. If retorquing the connection provides acceptable results, take no further action.  If thereare signs of corrosion or if the resistance measurement still exceeds the acceptance criteria afterretorquing, disassemble, clean, and repair the connection per the following steps. 7.4.4.3. Determine which connection is the source of the high resistance by taking additionalresistance readings, as appropriate.NOTE:  By taking additional readings, the source of the high resistance can frequently be isolatedto a single connection.  This technique minimizes the number of connections that must be disas-sembled.7.4.4.4..Establish proper conditions and remove the battery from service.CAUTION:  Do not break the connection between an operating group of cells.7.4.4.5. Disassemble the connection to be repaired.7.4.4.6. Clean the connector and cell posts using a soft plastic-bristle brush or other soft tool untilno signs of corrosion or dirt remain.  Small imperfections in the lead can be carefully removedwith a fine file if the imperfection is preventing good contact between the mating surfaces.CAUTION:  Do not use a steel brush, brass brush, steel wool, emery cloth, sand-paper, metal file, or other abrasive device to clean connections; they will damage the lead plating on the connectors and posts.60AFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 1999 NOTE: If the cleaning results in exposing copper underneath the lead plating, a new connector shouldbe installed.  Terminal posts must be cleaned carefully because the posts cannot be replaced.7.4.4.7. Reapply anticorrosion grease onto the connectors and posts in accordance with the man-ufacturer’s instructions.WARNING:  Apply anticorrosion grease strictly in accordance with the manu-facturer’s instructions.  If the anticorrosion grease is overheated, it can exceed its flash point and start a fire.7.4.4.8. Reinstall the connectors and torque the bolts to the manufacturer’s required values. 7.4.4.9. Perform the connection resistance measurement again to confirm that the cleaning hascorrected the problem.7.5. Special Inspections:7.5.1. The purpose of a special inspection is to ensure that the battery has not been damaged by anunusual condition or event.  The annual inspection, including monthly and quarterly checks, should beperformed whenever the battery has experienced an unusual condition.  Examples of cases where aVRLA battery should receive a special inspection include:7.5.1.1. Severe discharge7.5.1.2. Severe overcharge7.5.1.3. Exposure to extreme high temperature7.5.1.4. Seismic event7.5.1.5. Exposure to abnormal environments, such as storm leakage through the roof onto a bat-teryAFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 199961Chapter 8 PERIODIC TESTS8.1. Capacity Discharge Test (Performance Test):8.1.1.  Background Information:8.1.1.1. A capacity test determines the extent to which a battery is capable of supplying the man-ufacturer’s rated discharge current for a given duration under a specific set of conditions.  It isdesigned to allow trending of the battery’s capacity by discharging the battery at a constant currentor power to a predefined endpoint voltage and comparing the actual discharge time to the manu-facturer’s rated discharge time.8.1.1.2. If the data has been properly obtained and recorded, the capacity test provides the mostinformation about the battery’s capacity and degree of internal deterioration.  Even more impor-tant, the user has a means of estimating where the battery is along its life curve.8.1.1.3..In general, the capacity test duration should correspond to the duty cycle duration asclosely as possible.  For example, if the battery was sized to provide a certain load for 2 hours, thecapacity test should also be conducted at the manufacturer’s 2-hour discharge rate.  Because of themargins normally designed into the battery size, a capacity test duration corresponding to the dutycycle duration should provide reasonable assurance that the battery can meet its design require-ments.8.1.2. Test Frequency:8.1.2.1. A capacity test should be performed as part of the acceptance testing of a new installa-tion.8.1.2.2. Perform a capacity test as necessary to resolve discrepancies in internal ohmic measure-ments (see paragraph 7.3.2).  Depending on the warranty, the battery manufacturer might requirecapacity test data rather than internal ohmic measurement data before a warranty claim will behonored.8.1.2.3. For critical installations, perform a capacity test every 2 years.  The basis for this test fre-quency (longer than specified in IEEE 1188) is that quarterly internal ohmic measurements shouldalso identify signs of degradation.  As noted above, internal ohmic measurement test results canlead to the performance of a capacity test.8.1.2.4. For non-critical applications, quarterly internal ohmic measurements are considered ade-quate; periodic capacity tests are not specified.  However, a capacity test might still be required toresolve signs of degradation from the internal ohmic measurement data.8.1.2.5. With regard to capacity testing, each facility is responsible for determining whether a par-ticular installation is designated as critical or non-critical.  A critical installation is one in which aloss of power can not be tolerated.8.1.2.6. If a capacity test is specified and the test equipment is not available, perform a continuitytest instead in accordance with paragraph 8.2.8.1.2.7. A stationary battery used in an engine starting application does not require a capacity testif the battery periodically starts the engine.  The monthly, quarterly, and annual inspections are62AFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 1999still required for stationary engine starting batteries.  Note that this manual does not apply tomotive power batteries.8.1.3. Initial Conditions for Test:8.1.3.1. Equalize the battery only if recommended by the manufacturer and return it to floatcharge for a minimum of 72 hours but less than 30 days before the start of the test. NOTE: Some manufacturers do not recommend equalizing VRLA batteries to minimize gassing andwater consumption.  In general, an equalize charge should not be required specifically for a capacity test.8.1.3.2. Check all battery connections and ensure that battery connection resistance measure-ments are within the expected tolerances.  Correct any potential problems before starting the test. 8.1.3.3. Measure and record the float voltage of each cell just prior to the test.8.1.3.4. Measure and record the cell temperature of 10% or more of the cells just prior to the testto establish an average temperature.8.1.3.5. Measure and record the battery terminal float voltage.8.1.3.6. Take adequate precautions (such as isolating the battery to be tested from the DC system)to ensure that a failure will not affect other equipment.8.1.4. Capacity Test Procedure:WARNING:Observe safety precautions for working with energized DC equip-ment and batteries.8.1.4.1. Verify that the pretest requirements described in paragraph 8.1.3. have been completed.8.1.4.2. Verify that the battery area ventilation is operating normally.8.1.4.3. Determine the discharge rate by dividing the manufacturer’s rated discharge (for thedesired duration) by the appropriate temperature correction factor (based on the cell temperaturereadings).  Consult the manufacturer for the proper discharge temperature correction factors for aspecific battery.8.1.4.4. Set up a test discharge load capable of maintaining the required constant current or con-stant power test discharge rate.  The load bank typically generates a considerable amount of heatduring the test; locate the load bank where it will not overheat other installed equipment.8.1.4.5. Disconnect the battery charger from the battery and connect the load bank to the battery.CAUTION:  Be careful not to short-circuit the battery while making the con-nections to the load bank.  One approach is to connect the cables first to the load bank, followed by the connection to the battery.  The reason for this order of events is that the connection of the positive and negative leads at the load bank can be very close together with little room for error.NOTES:If the battery charger cannot be disconnected from the battery, the test discharge rate must be adjustedto compensate for the battery charger contribution.AFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 199963Cell jumpering equipment should be available and ready for use in case a cell(s) needs to be jumperedduring the test.8.1.4.6. Start the timer and begin the load test at the temperature-corrected test discharge rate.8.1.4.7. Monitor the test current throughout the test and adjust the load bank as needed to main-tain a constant test current.8.1.4.8. Measure and record individual cell voltages and the battery terminal voltage.  Take thereadings just prior to starting the test, at the beginning of the test when load is first applied, at peri-odic intervals during the test, and at the completion of the test.  At least three sets of readingsunder load should be taken.  Measure individual cell voltages between respective posts of likepolarity of adjacent cells, as shown in figure 8.1., to include the intercell connector voltage drop. Figure 8.1. Typical Cell Voltage Measurement.8.1.4.9. Maintain the test discharge rate until the battery terminal voltage decreases to the speci-fied average end of discharge voltage per cell times the number of cells in the battery.  Do not con-tinue the test below the specified cutoff point; stop at the cutoff point to ensure that the batterycapacity is always calculated with the same reference conditions from test to test, and to preventoverdischarge of some cells.EXAMPLE:  A test performed on a 60-cell battery with a specified end voltage of 1.75 V per cell would terminate at 105 V per the following equation:Vend = (1.75 V) x  (Number of connected cells)8.1.4.10. Use the following criteria to determine whether a test should be terminated because of alow-voltage cell(s).8.1.4.10.1. If a cell is approaching cell reversal (1.0 V) and the test is >90% complete, con-tinue the test until the specified battery terminal voltage is reached.8.1.4.10.2. If the test is not near completion, an individual cell is approaching cell reversal(1.0 V), and the battery has not yet reached the specified terminal voltage, stop the test.  Dis-connect the low-voltage cell from the battery and bypass it by installing a jumper of adequateampacity between the adjacent cells.64AFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 19998.1.4.10.3. Calculate the new battery end terminal voltage limit due to removal of the cell andrestart the test.EXAMPLE:  If the test termination voltage was 105 V for 60 cells based on 1.75 V per cell, the new test termination voltage would be 103.25 V if one cell is jumpered out.NOTES:Once a cell has reached 1.0 V, the cell voltage drops rapidly and the cell is nearing or has reached com-plete exhaustion.  Continuing the test without jumpering the cell is acceptable only if the test is nearcompletion.The time required to jumper a cell and restart the test should be minimized.  The downtime should beless than 10% of the intended test duration or 6 minutes, whichever is shorter.  A longer downtimeallows the battery to recover capacity.  The downtime should not be included as part of the total dura-tion of the capacity test.Only one downtime is allowed per test.  Additional downtimes allow the battery to recover and falselyindicate a higher battery capacity.8.1.4.11. Observe the battery during the test for intercell connector heating.8.1.4.12. Terminate the test when the battery terminal voltage decreases to the calculated endvoltage.  Record the total test time.8.1.4.13. Disconnect the test equipment.8.1.4.14. Recharge the battery in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions and restore it tonormal standby service.8.1.4.15. Calculate battery capacity using the following equation for discharge times greater than1 hour:Percent capacity (77°F) = (Ta/Ts) x 100where:Ta = actual time of test to specified terminal voltageTs = manufacturer’s rated time to specified terminal voltage8.1.4.16. Compare the battery capacity to that obtained by previous capacity tests to determinethe trend in battery capacity.  A lead-acid battery typically requires replacement when its capacityhas fallen to 80% of its rated capacity.  Determine whether battery degradation is sufficient to war-rant more frequent capacity testing.  Evaluate the performance of individual cells to identify unac-ceptable cells.8.2. Continuity Test:8.2.1. Background Information:8.2.1.1. A continuity test is a short duration test of the battery’s capacity by having the batterycarry the system load.  A continuity test is normally initiated by turning off the associated batterycharger.AFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 1999658.2.1.2. A continuity test is to be performed instead of a capacity test (see paragraph 8.1) if capac-ity test equipment is not available.8.2.1.3. A continuity test requires close monitoring of battery voltage throughout the test toensure that a loss of power does not occur.8.2.2. Procedure:CAUTION:Conduct a continuity test during stable system conditions (no thunderstorms or other events that might require battery backup power).  Because the battery is partially discharged by the continuity test, stable system conditions are needed to ensure that the battery is recharged as soon as possible.8.2.2.1. Before starting a continuity test, check the charger output current to determine the systemload.  Review the manufacturer’s data sheet for the battery to predict how long the battery shouldbe capable of carrying this load.  Based on the total load and the battery’s rated capability, deter-mine how long to conduct the continuity test; it is not intended that a continuity test fully dis-charge the battery.  The battery should have greater than 50% of its original capacity when the testis complete.  Also, determine the minimum allowed DC voltage and establish test termination cri-teria above this minimum voltage.8.2.2.2. Initiate the continuity test by turning off the battery charger.CAUTION:Monitor battery voltage closely at the beginning of the test.  Immediately restore power to the charger if battery voltage is falling rapidly.8.2.2.3. Constantly monitor battery voltage during the continuity test.  Terminate the test byre-energizing the battery charger if the battery voltage falls to the low voltage limit established forthe test.  Otherwise, terminate the test when the battery has discharged for the planned duration.8.2.2.4. Evaluate the test results by comparing the discharge rate and discharge time to the manu-facturer’s rating for the battery.66AFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 1999Chapter 9 INSTALLATION AND REPLACEMENT9.1. Replacement Criteria:9.1.1. Over the life of any backup power system, the installed battery eventually requires replace-ment.  When the predicted end of life for a battery is less than 2 years away, the impending need forreplacement should be identified and budgeted.  Larger battery installations should be planned as farin advance as possible.  Smaller batteries might not need as much lead-time for evaluation.9.1.2. Any of the following conditions can require a battery replacement:9.1.2.1. Capacity below, at, or approaching 80% (as determined by a capacity test)9.1.2.2. Age approaching the manufacturer’s predicted service life9.1.2.3. Continuity test indicating low battery capacity9.1.2.4. Excessive number of individual cell failures such that the entire battery should bereplaced rather than individual cells9.1.2.5. Load growth that prevents the battery from meeting its load requirements9.1.2.6. New or revised design requirements9.1.2.7. Severe battery degradation9.1.3. Except for cases of sudden battery degradation, trending of battery performance should allowmaintenance personnel to predict when replacement will be necessary.9.1.4. Individual cells might require replacement when a capacity test or an internal ohmic measure-ment determines that they are degraded.  Unless the battery is nearing the end of its service life ormany cells in the battery are degraded, it is acceptable to replace individual cells within the battery.Based on industry experience to date, it is likely that some cells will require replacement in the first 4years of service.9.2. Battery Size Verification:9.2.1. Some well-built and well-maintained batteries can last for many years.  For a battery that wasoriginally installed several years ago, it is possible that the design of other equipment in the facility orthe design criteria for the facility has changed.  Consider the following sizing guidelines for replace-ment batteries:9.2.1.1. The facility might have more load on the battery than anticipated when it was originallysized.  A load check should be performed as part of a battery replacement to confirm that thereplacement battery is properly sized.9.2.1.2. The original criteria for battery sizing might have assumed a shorter duty cycle thandesirable for newer installations today.  Replacement batteries could require a larger size just tomeet the current criteria for the facility.9.2.1.3. Verify the manufacturer’s performance ratings for the battery.  In the years since the lastbattery was installed, battery manufacturers might have changed the battery ratings.  AFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 1999679.2.1.4. Verify, if possible, that the original battery was properly sized, including allowances foraging, temperature, and design margin.  It is possible that the battery was too small to fulfill itsoriginal design requirements with all factors considered.9.3. Design Verification for a Replacement Battery Larger Than the Original:9.3.1. If the decision is made to replace a battery with a larger battery, check the following systemdesign features:9.3.1.1. Verify that the larger battery, including the new battery rack will physically fit within theavailable footprint and that the allowable floor loading is not exceeded.9.3.1.2. Check the new battery fault current and determine if protective devices and distributionequipment are still within their interrupting or withstand ratings.9.3.1.3. Determine if the existing charger can recharge the battery in a reasonable time.  A largercharger might be required as part of the battery replacement.9.3.1.4. Verify that the battery cables are large enough to carry the larger battery output current.9.4. Check of Other Equipment:9.4.1. For a good battery installation, a battery replacement is a relatively rare event.  The rest of thesystem should be inspected and upgraded, as needed, as part of the battery replacement.  While thebattery is out of service for replacement, perform the following:9.4.1.1. Inspect DC system breakers.9.4.1.2. Inspect cabling for aging or damage.  Replace as necessary.9.4.1.3. nspect the battery rack for damage or corrosion.  Replace as necessary.9.4.1.4. Replace older fuses in the DC system as a precautionary measure.9.4.2. The charger should receive special attention as part of a battery replacement.  Complete the fol-lowing:9.4.2.1. If the new battery has a larger capacity, confirm that the charger size is still adequate.9.4.2.2. Check the voltmeter calibration at the float and equalize voltages.9.4.2.3. Check for loose connections and evidence of overheating.9.4.2.4. Check the charger failure alarm by opening the AC breaker.  Check the setting of othervoltage relays.9.4.2.5. Inspect contacts on relays for signs of pitting or burning.9.4.2.6. Evaluate the output filter capacitors and replace if necessary.9.4.3. As part of the battery replacement, make everything in the system as new as possible, not justthe battery.  The other equipment also ages.  If it is not inspected and upgraded during the batteryreplacement, it might be many years before it is looked at closely again.9.5. Maintenance Checks of a New Battery:68AFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 19999.5.1. Review all manufacturer’s recommendations for the installation and operation of the battery.The installed location and configuration must comply with the manufacturer’s requirements.9.5.2. Perform the following maintenance-related tasks as part of the installation:9.5.2.1. Inspect all cells for damage before installation.  Verify that the cells were stored in accor-dance with the manufacturer’s recommendations.9.5.2.2. Once the battery is installed, apply an initial charge in accordance with the manufac-turer’s recommendations.9.5.2.3. Torque all intercell connections in accordance with the manufacturer’s specifications.  Ifa micro-ohmmeter is available, take a baseline set of intercell and termination resistance measure-ments.  These resistance measurements will form the basis for future acceptance criteria.  9.5.2.4. Record baseline internal ohmic measurements for all cells.9.5.2.5. A capacity test is recommended as part of the installation if the manufacturer did not per-form an acceptance test before shipment.  The purpose of this capacity test is to confirm adequatebattery capacity and to identify any failed cells.  If a capacity test is not performed, evaluate theinternal ohmic measurements to ensure that all cells are consistent.  Abnormal internal ohmicmeasurements might still require a capacity test to ensure that the battery is acceptable.9.6. Warranty Considerations:9.6.1. Most manufacturers offer a 1 or 2 year complete replacement warranty with a pro-rated war-ranty thereafter for larger stationary batteries.  If the battery fails during the full-replacement period,the manufacturer will usually replace it at no charge.  After the full-replacement period, the warrantyis pro-rated based on the number of months in service, with the pro-rated amount based on the originalbattery cost.  The pro-rated amount is normally applied as a credit to the current price of a replacementbattery.  Shipping and installation costs are usually excluded from the warranty.9.6.2. The Power Conditioning and Continuation Interfacing Equipment (PCCIE) Special Mainte-nance Team (SMT) has negotiated a different warranty for certain uninterruptible power system(UPS) equipment.  The contract was written with a full replacement of the battery within the first 3years for any defects in materials and workmanship.  After the first 3 years, the battery has a pro-ratedwarranty for an additional 3 years.9.6.3. The manufacturer’s warranty usually specifies required maintenance that must be performedand records that must be kept so as to document that the battery was properly maintained.  Theremight also be restrictions on the average ambient temperature or the number of cycles placed on thebattery.9.6.4. The warranty, including full-replacement and pro-rated periods, is a commercial considerationestablished by the manufacturer.  The warranty period might not have a direct relationship to theactual expected service life.  For example, several studies have shown that VRLA cells often failwithin 4 to 7 years, despite having a 20-year warranty.9.7. Life Cycle Management:9.7.1. A good system design balances the technical requirements with the cost and ongoing mainte-nance requirements.  Consider the following factors when selecting the battery size and type:AFPAM32-1186   1 AUGUST 1999699.7.1.1. Application and duty cycle requirements9.7.1.2. System interface limitations9.7.1.3. Service environment9.7.1.4. Initial equipment cost9.7.1.5. Installation cost9.7.1.6. Ongoing maintenance cost9.7.1.7. Periodic replacement cost9.7.2. Some battery life cycle work sheets have shown a substantial savings for VRLA batteries(based on the assumption of a 20-year life and virtually no maintenance).  An assessment of a battery’sactual cost must be based on realistic life projections; consider the following costs:9.7.2.1. Initial purchase of battery and rack, including freight.9.7.2.2. Estimated installation cost, if different for the various battery types.9.7.2.3. Periodic maintenance expense.  The cost of monthly, quarterly, and annual maintenanceshould be assessed.  Estimate maintenance costs for VRLA batteries based on the requirements ofthis AFMAN.9.7.2.4. Periodic replacement.9.7.3. Assume a service life of 8 years for life cycle calculations of VRLA batteries.  This is typicallyshorter than the warranty life, but is based on the industry experience to date.9.7.4. For life cycle planning, schedule replacement of long-life VRLA batteries every 8 years.  Thereplacement schedule can be extended if maintenance records indicate acceptable performance.JOHN W.
