Response Force (CRF) Mission. The  CRF  provides  first  respondercontingency response (CR) forces to the joint force commander, regardless of Service. CRFs maybe composed of a scalable contingency response group (CRG), contingency response element(CRE), and contingency response team (CRT). CR missions include the air component to the jointtask force-port opening (JTF-PO), air base opening (ABO), and support to the Global Air MobilitySupport System (GAMSS). A CRF may also have mobility advisory roles that include air mobilitydivision (AMD) augmentation or stand-alone capability, partner service mobility liaisons, andbuilding partnership capacity. For more details on air advising, refer to AFTTP 3-4.5, AirAdvising. CRFs may also be tasked with defense support of civil authorities (DSCA) andnoncombatant evacuation operation (NEO) missions. Refer to AFI 10-202, Contingency ResponseForces for more information on CRF organization, mission sets, deployable capabilities andfunctions.1.2 Mission Planning. Mission planning is the comprehensive understanding and build-up of anexpected operation to include mission analysis, logistics, and mission execution considerations.The desired end state of mission planning produces the best possible picture of the mission, thedeployed environment, the operational plans for deployment, employment and redeployment, andthe required or desired timelines.1.3 Designating Planning Team. The planning team should consist of a lead planner and keypersonnel needed for the mission; to include at a minimum functional area leads/subject matterexperts (SME).1.4 Mission Orders. Planners should clearly understand the command authority as identified inthe planning directives such as a warning order (WARNORD) or standing execute order(EXORD) as described in Joint Publication 5-series. See Table 1.1, Mission Orders.Table 1.1 Mission Orders (1 of 2)Order TypeIntended ActionWarning Order WARNORD • Initiates development and evaluation of courses of action (COA) by supported commander.• Requests commander’s estimate be submitted.Planning OrderPLANORD • Begins execution planning of anticipated President  or Secretary of Defense (SecDef) selected COA.• Directs preparation of OPORD or contingency plan.SecDef Approval Required• Not required when WARNORD includes deployment or deployment preparation actions.• No.• Conveys anticipated COA selection by the President or SecDef.1-2Table 1.1 Mission Orders (2 of 2)Order TypeIntended ActionAlert Order ALERTORD • Begins execution planning on AFTTP 3-4.7, 30 September 2017President or SecDef selected COA.• Directs preparation of OPORD or contingency plan.• Increase/decrease deployability posture of units.Prepare to Deploy OrderPTDOSecDef Approval Required• Yes.• Conveys COA selection by the President or SecDef.• Yes, refers to five levels of deployability posture deployment/redeployment order.• Yes, required for movement of unit personnel and equipment into combatant commander’s area of responsibility (AOR).• Yes.• Specific to the OPORD.Deployment/ Redeployment OrderExecute OrderOperation OrderFragmentary OrderDEPORD • Deploy/redeploy forces.• Establish C-day/L-hour.• Increase deployability.• Establish joint task force (JTF).• Implement President or SecDef decision directing execution of a COA or OPORD.• Effect coordinated execution of an operation.EXORDOPORDFRAGORD • Issued as needed after an OPORD to change or modify the OPORD execution.• No.1.5 Sample Mission Execution Timeline. Concept of operations (CONOPS) begin when theunit is notified to deploy. The unit or higher headquarters initiates planning. CR leadership andplanners should be familiar with deployment requirements from AFI 10-403, DeploymentPlanning and Execution, and local operating instructions (e.g., installation deployment plan[IDP]), in order to ensure adequate predeployment preparation on a compressed timeline. Thisplanning sequence starts with notification hour (N-hour), followed with arrival hour (A-hour), andends with redeployment hour (R-hour). The following example is for an alert force, incorporatedwith an assessment team (AT), which is directed to deploy within 12 hours of receiving adeployment order or tasking. See Table 1.2, Mission Execution Timeline.AFTTP 3-4.7, 30 September 2017Table 1.2 Mission Execution Timeline1-3Timing (Hour)N-hourN+1N+6N+12A-hourA + 4A + 12A + 12A + 12+30A + 24A + 24DeliverableReceive deployment/redeployment order/voice  command (VOCO).Mission analysis brief and/or commander selects course of action (COA).Predeparture brief.Personnel manifested/equipment joint inspected.

Mission planning is a disciplined process for making key decisions andagreeing on actions that will shape and guide what an organization is, what it does, and why itdoes it. Planning is an important aspect of strategic thinking and management. By working on amission plan together a team can: (1) think creatively about the focus and direction of theorganization’s work; (2) strengthen team approaches by defining together a clear focus anddirection; (3) develop plans collaboratively with partner organizations, beneficiaries and otherorganizations; (4) provide a framework against which to monitor progress, learn from experience,and make the changes necessary to improve effectiveness and impact; and (5) enable decisions tobe made about the best use of the human and financial resources available. Understand that yourmission plan will be a unique reflection of your organization. Mission plans are as different fromeach other as the organizations for which they are developed. See Table 1.3, Mission PlanningChecklist and Table 1.4, Host Base Checklist for sample checklists that can provide CRFs with abaseline of mission planning.

Transition of the airbase is a critical and deliberate process that should beidentified and resourced during mission planning for follow-on forces, subsequent roll up, andreconstitution. Transition for a CRF can include two phases depending on the operation: (1)handoff of the airbase from the seizure force, and (2) CRF transition of the airbase tofollow-on-forces or the host nation (HN).3.2 Transition from Seizure to CRF. Transition from seizure force to CRF initial airfield and/orairbase opening begins either with elements of the CRF imbedded or non-imbedded with theseizure force. Seizure force operations may be characterized by forcible entry, such as anamphibious assault, airborne assault, or air assault operation led by joint land and/or maritimeforces or a deliberate land offensive operation. Non-imbedded CRFs are those elements that arenot part of the planned assault but are called upon to provide airfield and/or airbase openingcapabilities following seizure by joint land and/or maritime forces.3.2.1 Initial Actions. CRF should make every effort to contact an Air Mobility LiaisonOfficer (AMLO) first, if one is part of the operation. If the seizure force is still engaged in thefight, do not expect the land force commander to initially meet the assessment team or CRFcommander at the airfield. Expect the commander of seizure force unit occupying airfield toprovide initial SITREP. Discussion topics for the initial SITREP are provided in Table 3.1,Sample Handoff Checklist for Seizure Force to CRF. The items in the checklist are prioritizedto aid with brevity, depending on the conditions of the operational environment, and should becompleted prior to the formal hand over between the land force commander (if possible) ordesignated representative (i.e., S3 or XO) and CRF commander.NOTE: This checklist is intended to be a guide and not meant to be run to completion for allsituations. Be mindful of operational environment and use judgment to determine what must bediscussed. This checklist is also available as an attachment to this PDF.Table 3.1 Sample Handoff Checklist for Seizure Force to CRFA. Priority 11.

A significant, but often overlooked, process inthe operations life cycle is transition to follow-on forces and subsequent roll up plan.Consideration should be given to the long-term use of the airfield. Refer to AFTTP 3-2.68,Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Airfield Opening, Appendix C, SampleAirfield Transition Checklist and AFTTP 3-4.4, Contingency Airfield Operations.

Roll up should be done whether returning to home station or forwarddeploying. CRTs, aerial porters, and logistics personnel make good leads for the roll up plan. Plansshould be based on the advice from each functional SME. This facilitates a smooth transition andensures coverage of all areas of concern in airfield and airbase operations. Most roll up plansrevolve around returning to home station. Consideration should be given to preparing equipmentas best as possible before returning to home station to make reconstitution quick and easy.3.5.1 Timeline Example. Roll up should begin 12 hours prior to the last estimated aircraftdeparture for redeployment. However, most actions will begin upon redeployment notification(i.e., airlift request). See Table 3.4, Timeline Example for an example roll up—an actual rollup timeline with be based on actual airlift schedule.Table 3.4 Timeline Example (1 of 2)ZuluLocalActionImplement/distribute roll up plan.Notify host nation (HN) representatives.Coordinate specialists and war readiness spares kit (WRSK) support.Identify personnel/cargo by load.Coordinate fuel load.Establish actual seats available by chalk.Develop vehicle turn-in plan/schedule.Marshall non-essential equipment.Coordinate with tanker airlift control center (TACC) for support aircraft.Publish passenger-processing plan by chalk, location, and time.Inspect/weigh/mark equipment.Not Later Than (NLT)R - 12R - 11R - 11R - 11R - 10R - 10R - 10R - 10R - 10R - 8R - 63-20Table 3.4 Timeline Example (2 of 2)AFTTP 3-4.7, 30 September 2017ActionMarshall cargo by chalk.Final meals and billeting check out.Work area phase down.Final crew alerts.Cargo loading.Work areas and vehicles cleaned.Passenger processing/loaded.Last aircraft departs.ZuluLocalNot Later Than (NLT)R - 6R - 4R - 4R - 4R - 3R - 2R - 1+30R3.5.2 Roll Up to Forward Deploy Checklist. It is important that the unit arrives at theforward deployed location with a full gear load out and ready for the next mission. Forwarddeployment can be difficult due to time constraints. Resupplying used stock can take time;begin inventory and resupply ordering as soon as possible when forward deployment isimminent. See Table 3.5, Roll Up to Forward Deploy Checklist.

Team leads are responsible for ensuring reconstitution of personnel andequipment is accomplished. Key considerations should be made to provide support for returningforces allowing transition back to the normal environment and reconstitution for futuredeployments. This process entails planning that will return units back to their full combatcapability in a short time. While there is no one set way to conduct reconstitution, considerationsmust be given to prioritizing and restoring levels of consumables expended during themission/tasking, and the recovery of lost training. Every base/unit will have to assess their ownsituation based on variables such as the magnitude, duration, and intensity of a mission/tasking,consumption rates, and the operational location (i.e., fixed vs. austere base).3.6.1 Sample Reconstitution Checklist. Build a schedule based on aircraft/truck return time.To the maximum extent, personnel and equipment should be returned to a deployable statewithin 72 hours of return to home station. Sometimes this may not be possible due to phasedredeployment or extended travel times of equipment. See Table 3.6, Sample ReconstitutionChecklist.

Commanders at all levels use terrorism threatassessments plus their own threat analyses as a basis for developing plans and programs to protectassets within their area of responsibility (AOR). These are called force protection conditions.FPCONs describe progressive levels of terrorist threats and initiate preplanned defensive ormitigation actions. FPCON declarations are normally provided through the chain-of-command,public address system, and other available resources. See Table 4.3, Force Protection Condition(FPCON).4-4AFTTP 3-4.7, 30 September 2017Table 4.3 Force Protection Condition (FPCON)ConditionFPCON NORMALFPCON ALPHA(Air Force Modified)FPCON BRAVOFPCON CHARLIEFPCON DELTADescriptionThis condition applies when a general global threat of possible terrorist activity exists and warrants a routine security posture. At a minimum, access control will be conducted at all Department of Defense (DOD) installations and facilities.This condition applies when there is an increased general threat of possible terrorist activity against personnel or facilities, the nature and extent of which are unpredictable, and circumstances do not justify full implementation of FPCON BRAVO measures. However, it may be necessary to implement certain measures from higher FPCONs resulting from intelligence received or as a deterrent. The measures in this FPCON must be capable of being maintained indefinitely.This condition applies when an increased or more predictable threat of terrorist activity exists. Sustaining BRAVO measures for a prolonged period may affect operational capability and military-civil relationships with local authorities.This condition applies when an incident occurs or intelligence is received indicating that some form of terrorist action or targeting against personnel or facilities is likely. Prolonged implementation of CHARLIE measures may create hardship and affect the activities of the unit and its personnel.This condition applies in the immediate area where a terrorist attack has occurred or when intelligence has been received that terrorist action against a specific location or person is imminent. FPCON DELTA is usually declared as a localized condition. FPCON DELTA measures are not intended to be sustained for an extended duration.AFTTP 3-4.7, 30 September 20174-54.4 Attack Warning Signals.

J2 emphasis is on the enemy. Activities may include human intelligence (HUMINT) and counterintelligence, target identification and selection, and electronic intelligence gathering and analysis.The J3 division assists the joint force commander (JFC) in the direction and control of operations. Its work begins with the initial planning and extends through the integration and coordination of joint operations.The J4 division develops logistics plans and coordinates and supervises supply, maintenance, repair, evacuation, transportation, construction, and related logistics activities. Responsibilities may include weapons surety, civil engineering support, transportation management, etc. Because logistics support is primarily a Service responsibility, the thrust of joint logistics operations may be to coordinate Service programs and integrate them with the joint commander’s concept of support. Knowledge of Service policies and doctrine is essential.The J5 division does the long-range planning. It prepares campaign, concept, and operation plans, and the associated commander’s estimate of the situation. The J5 is often responsible for special weapons planning. In commands without a separate J5 division, the operations division performs the function.The J6 division may be found with a variety of names and designators. The functions of the division include handling command responsibilities for communications and frequency control, tactical communications planning and execution, and management and development of electronics and automatic information systems.4-14AFTTP 3-4.7, 30 September 2017Figure 4.3 Enlisted Rank Insignia of the US Armed ForcesE-1   E-2   E-3   E-4 E-5    E-6 E-7 AIR FORCE  E-8                E-9  SEA No Insignia Airman Basic (AB)     Airman (Amn)  Airman First Class (A1C)   Senior Airman (SrA) Staff Sergeant (SSgt)  Technical Sergeant (TSgt)  Master Sergeant (MSgt)  First Sergeant (FS)  Senior Master Sergeant (SMSgt)  First Sergeant (FS)   Chief Master Sergeant (CMSgt) First Sergeant (FS)   Command Chief Master Sergeant (CCM) Sergeant of Chief Master the Air Force   Command Sergeant Major (CSM) Sergeant Major of the Army (SMA) ARMY  Sergeant First Class (SFC)  Master Sergeant (MSG)  First Sergeant (1SG)   Sergeant Major (SGM) MARINES        Gunnery Sergeant (GySgt) Master Sergeant (MSgt) First Sergeant (1stSgt) Master Gunnery Sergeant (MGySgt) Sergeant Major (SgtMaj) NAVY  Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps (SgtMajMC)  Private E-2 (PV2)   Private First Class (PFC)     Corporal (CPL)  Sergeant (SGT)  Staff Sergeant (SSG)   Specialist    Private First Class (PFC) Lance Corporal (LCpl) Corporal (Cpl) Sergeant (Sgt) Staff Sergeant (SSgt)     No Insignia Private E-1 (PV1)   No Insignia  Private (PvT)     No Insignia   Seaman Recruit (SR)      Seaman Recruit (SR)        Seaman Apprentice (SA) Seaman (SA) Petty Officer 3rd Class (PO3)  Petty Officer 2nd Class (PO2)          Chief Petty Officer (CPO) Senior Chief Petty Officer (CPO) Petty Officer 1st Class (PO1) Master Chief Petty Officer (MCPO) COAST GUARD   Force Command Master Chief Petty Officer (FORMC)    Fleet Command Chief Petty Officer (FLTMC) Seaman Apprentice (SA) Seaman (SA) Petty Officer 3rd Class (PO3)) Petty Officer 2nd Class (PO2) Petty Officer 1st Class (PO1)Chief Petty Officer (CPO) Senior Chief Petty Officer (CPO Master chief Petty Officer (MCPO) Command Master chief (CMC)   Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy (MCPON) Master Chief Petty Officer of the Coast Guard (MCPO-CG) AFTTP 3-4.7, 30 September 20174-15Figure 4.4 Officer Rank Insignia of the US Armed ForcesO-1 O-2 O-3 O-4 O-5 O-6 AIR FORCE O-7 O-8 O-9 O-10 Special         Second Lieutenant (2d Lt)  First Lieutenant (1st Lt)  Lieutenant Second (2LT)  Lieutenant First (1LT)  Second Lieutenant (2ndLt)  First Lieutenant (1stLt)      Ensign (ENS)   Lieutenant Junior Grade (LTJG) Ensign (ENS)   Lieutenant Junior Grade (LTJG) Warrant Officer (WO1) The grade of Warrant Officer (WO) is no longer in use.

Personnel will proceed to the armory and properly turn in your weapon and ammunition and proceed to their quarters.All personnel must maintain their PIN cards. Upon entering a facility, the PIN cards will be given to the door guard and returned upon departure of facility. Consideration should be given to obtain small stickers that can be placed on members ID’s that display their PIN #. This does two things, it allows the military ID to act as the entry authorization and it allows a member to be identified if something happens inside the building.Accountability of personnel on duty during increased force protection conditions (FPCON) will be conducted after any significant incident/attack or as directed by the commander.Figure 4.6 Work/Rest Cycle and Fluid IntakeWork Rest Cycles and Fluid Replacement GuidelinesHeatCategoryWBGT1Index (ºF)Light (Easy) WorkModerate WorkHard (Heavy) WorkWork/Rest2NL4NLNLNL78-81.982-84.985-87.988-89.9>9050/10minWater Intake3(Quart/Hour)1/21/23/43/41Work/Rest2NL50/10min40/20min30/30min20/40minWater Intake3(Quart/Hour)Work/Rest2Water Intake3(Quart/Hour)3/43/43/43/4140/20min3/430/30min30/30min20/40min10/50min111112345NOTES:1.
