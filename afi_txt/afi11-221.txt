SUMMARY OF CHANGES This  document  is  substantially  revised  and  must  be  completely  reviewed.    Major  changes include:  the  Air  Refueling  Management  System  (ARMS)  as  the  sole  vehicle  for  receiver  units and  other  requesting  agencies  to  submit,  change,  or  cancel  Chairman  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff (CJCS) Priority 1 and 2 AR requests; the Air Refueling Liaison Office (ARLO) which provides enterprise-wide  visibility  of  both  tanker  capacity  and  emerging  receiver  AR  training  requests; and  the  Air  Refueling  Scheduling  Tool  (ARST)  as  the  USAF  system  of  record  for  matching receiver training air refueling needs for CJCS Priority 3 and 4 to tanker capacity. AFI11-221  13 JULY 2016 3 Chapter 1 TANKER SCHEDULING RESPONSIBILITIES 1.1.  Single  Manager.  Commander,  USTRANSCOM  (CDRUSTRANSCOM)  is  DoD  single manager  for  transportation  other  than  service-unique  or  theater-assigned  assets,  IAW  DoD Directive 5158.04.  Air Force designates HQ AMC as the Component-MAJCOM in support of  CDRUSTRANSCOM  and  as  the  USAF  Lead  Command  for  KC-10,  KC-46,  and  KC-135  air refueling operations  IAW AFPD 10-21. When servicing global  force management air refueling requirements, Combatant Commanders (CCDRs), through their respective Air Operations Center (AOC),  use  the  procedures  defined  in  this  instruction  to  determine  projected  receiver  AR requirements and task tanker units to fill those requirements. 1.1.1.  All  AR  support  will  be  based  on  CJCS  priority  of  the  receiver  mission,  IAW Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 4120.02D, List of Priorities - DOD Transportation Movement Priority System. (T-0).   In order to qualify as a priority 1, 2, or 3 requirement AR must be necessary to complete the mission or deployment. 1.2.  Responsibilities.  USTRANSCOM Operations and Plans Directorate-Air Refueling Branch (USTC/J3WR)  serves  as  the  single  focal  point  within  USTRANSCOM  for  AR  validation  and management  of  deployment,  redeployment,  employment,  and  sustainment  of  mobility  forces through the Unified Command Plan.  Priority 1 and 2 AR requirements (and all AR requirements supporting Coronets  regardless of priority – see  Chapter 3) will be validated by USTC/J3WR, and  will  be  supported  to  the  limit  of  global  capacity.  (T-0).    Priority  3  and  below  AR requirements  are  normally  validated  and  allocated  at  the  appropriate  component  command.  MAJCOMs/CCMDs/NAFs/Services may request USTRANSCOM validation of select priority 3 AR requirements. 1.2.1.  Receiver agencies (Services, CCMDs, MAJCOMs, NAFs, FOAs,  DRUs, and wings) must  designate  an  Air  Refueling  Manager  (central  agency  or  office)  for  coordinating  AR support. (T-1).   In addition, receiver unit scheduling offices have primary responsibility for detailed scheduling. 1.2.2.  Tanker Reporting:  Various tools are used to collect AR mission activity data.   AMC Fuel  Tracker,  AF  Form  791,  Aerial  Tanker  In-flight  Issue  Log,  Fuel-tracker  Air  Refueling Module (FARM), and AFTO Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document, are the primary reporting instruments for ensuring AR mission data is accurately compiled.  The tanker  aircrew  is  responsible  for  ensuring  the  accuracy  and  completeness  of  all  of  these forms. Tanker planners will ensure aircrews have accurate receiver and mission data prior to launch.  (T-2).    Post-mission  paperwork  should  be  retained  and  turned  in  to  appropriate accounting agencies upon return to home station.  All post-mission data will be entered into the Global Decision Support System (GDSS) as soon as possible after sortie completion. (T-2). 1.2.3.  Foreign  Military  Sales  (FMS)  case  tanker  units  will  send  completed  AF  Forms 781s/791s,  flight  orders,  and  paid  travel  vouchers  to  include  crew  and  mission  essential personnel  (MEP)  directly  to  AMC/Financial  Management  and  Comptroller/Financial Services (FMFF) within 5 workdays after mission completion. (T-1). 4 AFI11-221  13 JULY 2016 1.3.  Air Refueling Delays  and Cancellations.  All receiver and tanker units scheduled for AR should coordinate delays or cancellations as soon as possible. 1.3.1.  Tankers  should  make  every  effort  to  accommodate  their  receiver  if  the  receiver experiences a delay before tanker launch, crew duty day permitting.  However, the tanker is not  required  to  delay  more  than  4  hours  to  accommodate  Formal  Training  Unit  or Replacement Training Unit training and 3 hours for all other training. 1.3.2.  Tanker  aircraft  should  plan  to  arrive  at  the  Air  Refueling  Control  Point  (ARCP)  no earlier than Air Refueling Control Time (ARCT) minus 20 minutes and depart no later than (NLT) ARCT plus 10 minutes unless specifically cleared by the appropriate air traffic control (ATC)  facility  for  an  extended  delay,  as  prescribed  in  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration Handbook 7610.4S, Special Military Operations and ATP-3.3.4.2.(B), Air To Air Refuelling.  Tankers are not required to delay for receivers at the ARCP longer than 30 minutes after the ARCT.  (T-1).  Tanker  crew  should  coordinate  with  command  and  control  (C2)  agencies before  departing  ARCP  in  the  event  of  a  late  receiver.    When  operating  under  an  altitude reservation (ALTRV), aircraft must depart within the assigned “ALTRV Void if Aircraft Not Airborne by” (AVANA) time. 1.4.  Deviations  and  Waivers.  Unless  otherwise  directed,  waiver  authority  for  the  contents  of this instruction is AF/A3X. AFI11-221  13 JULY 2016 5 Chapter 2 TANKER VALIDATION, ALLOCATION, AND SCHEDULING 2.1.  Air Refueling Request Procedures. 2.1.1.  Air  Refueling  Management  System  is  the  sole  vehicle  for  receiver  units  and  other requesting  agencies  to  submit,  change,  or  cancel  CJCS  priority  1  and  2  (operational)  AR requests.   Use  of  any  other  alternate  method  must  be  specifically  approved  by USTRANSCOM.  (T-1).    Unless  otherwise  specified  in  this  instruction,  ARMS  is  the  sole vehicle for submitting, changing, or cancelling all Coronet AR requests, regardless of CJCS priority. 2.1.1.1.  All users will establish and maintain individual user accounts in  ARMS.  (T-1).  Receiver  units  will  request  ARMS  accounts  through  their  MAJCOM  or  Service validators.  (T-2).  ARMS  can  be  accessed  on  the  Consolidated  Air  Mobility  Planning System  (CAMPS)  Web  Portal  on  the  Nonsecure  Internet  Protocol  Router  Network  at   https://campsweb.maf.ustranscom.mil/Portal/UnprotectedForms/logout.aspx  or  the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network at https://campsweb.maf.ustranscom.smil.mil.  ARMS request procedures and information are delineated in the online help file. 2.1.2.  Air  Refueling  Scheduling  Tool  is  the  USAF  system  of  record  for  matching  receiver training  air  refueling  needs  (normally  CJCS  priority  3  and  4)  to  tanker  capacity.    See Chapter 4, ARLO Program, for support for these requests. 2.1.3.  Request  For  Forces  (RFF).    CCDRs  may  submit  an  RFF  for  tankers,  crews,  and/or associated  support  forces  to  support  theater  AR  requirements.    In  these  cases  an  operation order (OPORD) is normally generated, or if an enduring requirement, identified in the Global Force Management Allocation Plan.  Operational Control (OPCON) is normally transferred to the requesting CCDR upon Secretary of Defense approval for a specified period.  The use of ARMS or ARST is not required. 2.1.4.  Service Level Missions.  MAJCOMs/NAFs/CCMDs/Services may request AR support for receiver requirements that may otherwise go unsupported.   618 AOC (TACC)/Mobility Management  Directorate,  Long-Range  Scheduling  Division  (XOBL)  schedules  service missions IAW the AMC/A3 Commander Air Forces Apportionment and Allocation Process (CAAP)/OPORD/Concept of Operations (CONOPS). 2.1.5.  Non-Tanker Mission.  If a tanker is performing another primary mission (i.e., Special Assignment Airlift Mission (SAAM), Channel Airlift, Aeromedical Evacuation) and is being considered to accomplish AR training requirements, the requestor or ARLO must coordinate the  event  with  the  responsible  planning  directorate.    The  primary  mission  has  priority  and will not be delayed to accommodate the receiver’s training requirements. 2.2.  Validation  (CJCS  Priority  1  and  2).  Air  refueling  requests  are  validated  at  multiple levels.    USTRANSCOM  is  the  USAF  and  Department  of  Defense  (DoD)  final  Validator.    Air refueling  request  validation  protocols  are  based  on  CJCS  priority,  request  timing,  origin  of request,  MAJCOM/NAF/CCMD/Service,  and  the  nature  of  the  refueling  operation.    The requesting  MAJCOM/NAF/CCMD/Service  will  designate  a  validator  to  review  requests originating from assigned units prior to being pushed to the next level in ARMS. (T-1). 6 AFI11-221  13 JULY 2016 2.2.1.  All  validators  will  ensure  AR  requests  are  complete,  accurate,  and  reflect  the  proper air  refueling  support  priority  IAW  CJCSI  4120.02D,  before  validation  in  ARMS.  (T-0). MAJCOM validators will ensure the accuracy of all AR data, authenticate requester contact information, and provide a comment within ARMS stating the request is accurate and what impact to the mission will result if tanker support is delayed or not provided. (T-1). 2.2.2.  Filling  short-notice  user  requests  requires  balancing  and  resolving  competing  user demands and priorities to achieve optimum tanker utilization. 2.2.2.1.  To reduce turbulence at the unit level, all CJCS Priority 1 and 2 ARMS requests made within 96 hours of Air Refueling Control Time (ARCT) must have a General/Flag Officer  endorsement/justification  included  with  the  request.  (T-0).    Reference  CJCSI 4120.02D, page B-1, for instructions. 2.2.2.2.  AR  requests  made  within  24  hours  of  required  tanker  takeoff    time  cannot  be requested/validated  through  normal  channels.    Direct  contact  with  USTRANSCOM  for validation and the tanker execution authority is  required.  (T-2).   AR requests within 24 hours will not normally be supported. 2.2.3.  USTRANSCOM  validation  is  not  required  when  AR  requests  between  tankers  and receivers, under the same OPCON, perform AR within the owning CCDR’s geographic Area of  Responsiblity  (AOR)  and  are in  applicable  Air  Tasking  Order.  EXCEPTION:  All Coronets must be validated by USTRANSCOM. (T-1). incorporated 2.2.3.1.  If  additional  tankers  are  required,  the  MAJCOM/CCMD/NAF/Service  will submit a request to USTRANSCOM via ARMS or submit an RFF for additional forces, as required. (T-1). 2.2.4.  Air  refueling  requests  for  intertheater  ARs  in  multiple  AORs  (e.g.  Global Power/Strike  missions,  RC-135  and  National  Airborne  Operations  Center  deployments), must  be  validated  by  the  MAJCOM/NAF/CCMD/Service  with  OPCON  of  the  receiver aircraft.  Air Force and DoD level validation will be accomplished by USTRANSCOM, who will  then  push  the  requirements  to  the  appropriate  MAJCOM/NAF/CCMD/Service  tanker allocation authority (barrel) for those ARs in their respective areas of responsibility. (T-1).  If the appropriate MAJCOM/NAF/CCMD/Service is unable to meet the requirement with their own air refueling assets, they will shortfall/non-support to USTRANSCOM via ARMS.  For multi-theater  air  refueling  requests  using  tankers  from  multiple  AORs,  a  lead  AOC  will  be designated.  (T-1).    The  lead  AOC  will  act  as  the  lead  planning  agency,  serve  as  the  single point of contact for the requesting agency, and monitor all tanker missions to ensure overall mission success.  (T-1).    Unless  otherwise coordinated, 618 AOC (TACC) will  normally be the  lead  AOC  for  multi-theater  AR  requests  involving  tankers  from  multiple  AOCs.  (T-1).  Once  an  AR  requirement  has  been  validated  by  USTRANSCOM,  the  requestor  should coordinate directly with the assigned AOC in the event only minor changes are required. 2.3.  Tanker  Allocation.  Available  KC-10,  KC-46,  and  KC-135  aircraft  will  be  allocated  to support  validated  AR  requirements  IAW  the  CJCSI  4120.02D  priority  system.  (T-0)    When short-notice  requests  require  canceling  previously  scheduled  missions,  the  CJCSI  4120.02D priority system will be used by tanker allocators to identify potential cancellations. (T-0). 2.3.1.  Tanker  Allocation  Timeline.    For  CJCS  Priority  1  and  2  requirements,  and  all Coronets,  receiver  units  will  initiate  the  tanker  allocation  process  by  submitting  an  ARMS AFI11-221  13 JULY 2016 7 request NLT 60 days prior to the start of each execution month (for Coronet missions, ACC AOS  will  normally  submit  the  ARMS  requests  NLT  60  days  prior  to  the  start  of  each quarter).  (T-1).    Coronet  requests  must  be  broken  out  by  leg.    These  air  refueling requirements  are  consolidated,  and  then  matched  with  available  tankers  in  the  618  AOC (TACC)’s  long-range  scheduling  process.    The  long-range  process  is  completed  when  618 AOC  (TACC)  publishes  the  final  long-range  schedule  30  days  prior  to  the  start  of  each month. or temporary duty 2.3.2.  Mission  Taskings  Inside  30  Days.    For  missions  requiring  deployment  of  tanker aircraft the MAJCOM/NAF/CCMD/Service validated request at least 30 calendar days prior to mission date or longer depending on area clearance requirements.  For CJCS Priority 1 and 2 requests inside 30 days of mission start, refer to short-notice scheduling process, section 2.5. personnel,  USTRANSCOM receive should 2.4.  Long-Range  Scheduling  Process.  618  AOC  (TACC)’s  long-range  scheduling  process  is used to match air refueling requirements with available tanker resources more than 30 days prior to the start of each execution month. 2.4.1.  USTRANSCOM validated air refueling requests will be forwarded to the appropriate MAJCOM/NAF/CCMD/Service tanker barrel for tanker sourcing.  (T-1). 2.4.2.  618  AOC  (TACC)  will  run  the  ARMS  “scheduler”  to  match  tanker  availability  with non  pre-coordinated  air  refueling  requests  and  initiate  the  ARMS  on-line  trading  period  60 days prior to the start of each execution month. (T-1). 2.4.3.  The  on-line  trader  provides  tanker  units  the  opportunity  to  buy,  sell,  or  trade requirements  with  other  tanker  units.    During  this  period,  new  requirements  may  still  be submitted as “Conference Added” requests. 2.4.4.  On-line trading will terminate and the long-range schedule will be published NLT 30 days before the execution month. (T-1).   The long-range schedule can be downloaded from the 618 AOC (TACC)/Mobility Management Directorate, Tanker Barrel (XOBK) website at https://tacc.us.af.mil/?action=xobk&XOBK  or  through  a  link  on  the  618  AOC  (TACC) home page (https://tacc.us.af.mil/).  All units will carefully review the published long-range schedule to identify deviations from submitted air refueling requests. (T-1). 2.4.5.  For  USTRANSCOM  validated  air  refueling  requirements  not  filled  prior  to,  or generated after publication of, the long-range schedule, sourcing efforts will continue via the short-range allocation process. (T-1).  Tanker barrels will continue to attempt to task unfilled requirements using the CJCSI 4120.02D priority system utilizing tanker assets authorized for allocation   Lower  priority  requirements  not  validated  by USTRANSCOM,  and  not  filled  prior  to  or  identified  after  publication  of  the  long-range schedule, will not be actively sourced.  Support for these lower priority requirements may be obtained as soft ARs coordinated directly between tanker and receiver units using ARST (see Chapter 4). through  CAAP.  (T-1). 2.5.  Short-Notice Scheduling Process.  Short-notice air refueling requirements are those single event  ARs  submitted  inside  30  days  of  tanker  execution,  for  priority  1  and  2  missions  per  the CJCSI, or those the receiver cannot forecast far enough in advance to be included in the monthly long-range  schedule.    Because  these  requirements  can  often  be  met  only  at  the  expense  of carefully  forecasted  and  planned  long-range  scheduling  requirements,  schedulers  should 8 AFI11-221  13 JULY 2016 minimize the use of the short-notice system.  Receiver units should make every effort to forecast and plan these missions far enough in advance for inclusion in the monthly long-range schedule. 2.5.1.  Mission  taskings inside 10 days but  not  inside 96 hours.  For missions not  requiring deployment  of  tanker  aircraft  or  personnel,  USTRANSCOM  must  receive  the  MAJCOM-validated request at least 10 calendar days prior to mission date. 2.5.2.  Mission taskings inside 96 hours.  Missions validated within 96-hours must have the approval  of  the  AOC/CC  with  Tactical  Control  of  the  tankers  in  addition  to  requirements stipulated in paragraph 2.2.2. 2.5.3.  Mission  taskings  within  24  hours  of  execution.    The  normal  request,  validation, scheduling process is impossible.  These requests will normally not be supported.  There are times in which the interval between mission tasking and required departure time is less than 24 hours.  When this happens, these missions are in execution and may be supported by the execution  authority  via  in-system  select.    Serious  consideration  to  the  importance  of  the mission  versus  impact  on  unit/aircrew  schedules  must  be  made.    Every  attempt  should  be made  to  delay  the  mission  outside  the  24-hour  period  before  attempting  to  gain  inside-24 hour approval.  Approval process is the same as for inside-96 hour requests. 2.5.4.  Normally,  lower  priority  single  event  AR  requests  (CJCS  Priority  3  and  4)  are  not validated by USTRANSCOM, and will not be supported through the Short-Notice scheduling process.  See Chapter 4, ARLO Program, for support to these requests. AFI11-221  13 JULY 2016 9 Chapter 3 CORONETS 3.1.  Mission Description.  Coronet identifies aircraft movements that are operating under ACC AOS  Movement  Control  (MOCON),  and  typically  have  a  transoceanic  leg.    Requests  for Coronet  AR  support  for  movements  that  do  not  meet  this  criterion,  including  movements between continental United States (CONUS) and Alaska, will be evaluated by USTRANSCOM on a case-by-case basis prior to validation.  Tanker support for over-land legs as part of multi-leg Coronets that include an extended over-water leg will normally be supported; however, limited tanker availability may require that fighters “hop” on the over-land legs and only receive tanker support for the extended, over-water legs. 3.1.1.  Coronets  entail  complex  coordination,  planning,  supervision,  and  execution  of  all functions  required  to  provide  AR  support.    AMC  is  the  single  manager  for  Coronet  tanker support.    As  such,  they  work  with  ACC  (single  manager  for  DoD  Coronet  movements)  to develop  movement  schedules  and  coordinate  all  Coronet  tanker  allocation,  planning,  and execution  functions.    CCDRs  with  OPCON  of  their  own  tankers  make  them  available  to AMC (to the max extent possible) to support Coronets transiting their AORs. 3.1.2.  AR  support  for  bombers,  airlifters,  and  other  large  aircraft  are  not  classified  as Coronets. 3.2.  Basic  Authority.  618  AOC  (TACC)  is  the  primary  point  of  contact  for  Coronet  AR support.    618  AOC  (TACC)  provides  oversight  of  all  tanker  agencies  conducting  Coronet planning  or  execution.    The  618  AOC  (TACC)  coordinates  as  necessary  with  other MAJCOM/NAF/CCMD/Services,  Department  of  State,  embassies,  foreign  governments,  ANG, AFRC,  and  various  other  Coronet  planning  agencies.    If  foreign  governments  or  international organizations  are  involved,  refer  to  AFMAN  16-101,  International  Affairs  and  Security Assistance Management. 3.2.1.  618  AOC  (TACC)  will  coordinate  for  all  Coronet  tanker  mission  requirements,  to include  determining  tanker  staging  locations  and  en  route  actions  necessary  to  support Coronets. 3.2.2.  There  is  no  change  of  OPCON  for  tanker  aircraft  as  a  result  of  supporting  Coronet operations.  CCMDs and MAJCOMs exercise OPCON of owned tanker assets through their respective  AOCs,  with  scheduling,  employment,  and  C2  of  all  tankers  participating  in  a Coronet provided by AMC via the 618 AOC (TACC). 3.2.3.  618  AOC  (TACC)  provides  standardized  Coronet  tanker  planning  and  execution guidance  and/or  templates,  which  is  used  for  all  Coronet  planning  and  execution  to  ensure standardization. 3.2.4.  All  tanker  aircraft  supporting  Coronet  movements  will  fly  according  to  applicable flight manuals, AFI 11-2 Mission Design Series (MDS) specific-instructions, and applicable MAJCOM guidance, whichever is more restrictive. (T-1). 3.3.  Request  for  Support.  ACC  AOS  is  responsible  for  requesting  Coronet  tanker  support.  Agencies  requiring  Coronet  support  should  follow  procedures  in  AFI  11-207,  Combat  Aircraft 10 AFI11-221  13 JULY 2016 Delivery.    ACC  AOS  is  responsible  for  providing  618  AOC  (TACC)  the  deploying  fighters’ flight plans.   requirements  and  timelines.  (T-1). 3.3.1.  Units  requesting  Dual  Role  support  must  comply  with  AFI  11-2MDS  Volume  3-specific   Units  must  route  requests  through USTRANSCOM, providing accurate cargo and passenger details (e.g. cargo weight, number of pallets,  and number of passengers).   Dual  Role cargo is  not  contractual  or guaranteed in any way.  The AR requirement must be met first, without regard to protecting ancillary Dual Role  cargo.    Additional  tanker  hours,  sorties,  or  allocation  days  will  not  be  expended  to protect Dual Role cargo. 3.3.1.1.  Last-minute  changes  to  mission  parameters  may  require  some,  or  all,  of  the user’s Dual Role cargo to be downloaded and left behind at the departure airfield, or any en route stop.  Users requiring guaranteed cargo movement should purchase a dedicated, funded SAAM. 3.3.1.2.  All waiver requests to Dual Role restrictions will be accomplished by the single manager for Coronet tanker support (AMC). (T-1).  Comply with AFI 11-2MDS Volume 3-specific waiver guidance. 3.4.  Scheduling  Coronet  Tanker  Support.  618  AOC  (TACC)  shares  overall  Coronet scheduling responsibility with ACC AOS.  After MAJCOM validation of Coronet AR requests, units requiring Coronet missions will process requests through ACC AOS. (T-1).  ACC AOS is the  single  manager  of  the  aircraft  delivery  mission.    ANG  and  AFRC  tanker  units  wishing  to volunteer to support fighter deployments should contact 618 AOC (TACC)/XOBK or volunteer through ARMS. 3.4.1.  ACC  AOS  will  submit  Coronet  AR  requests  (via  ARMS)  on  a  quarterly  basis  or  as soon as requirements are known for short notice requests. (T-1).  Following USTRANSCOM validation of the ARMS request, 618 AOC (TACC) will normally ensure supporting tanker units  are  identified  and  tasked  NLT  10  calendar  days  prior  to  tanker  launch  date.  (T-2). Exception:    Movement  of  straggler  aircraft  or  undelivered  fighter  aircraft  from  previously validated Coronets may require tasking inside 10 calendar days prior to tanker launch date or 3 calendar days prior to diplomatic clearance lead times, whichever is greater. 3.4.2.  Tanker  units  supporting  Coronets  will  provide  properly  configured/equipped  aircraft to  meet  Coronet  requirements  as  specified  by  618  AOC  (TACC).  (T-1).    KC-135s  on Coronet  missions  will  carry  a  drogue  for  possible  subsequent  Navy/Marine/FMS  Coronet support (N/A for round-robin missions from home station).  (T-1).  Tanker units desiring to transport  cargo  or  passengers  on  a  Coronet  mission  must  coordinate  their  requests  through 618 AOC (TACC). (T-2). 3.4.3.  Due  to  the  complexity  of  Coronets,  aircraft  commanders  will  be  formation  lead certified  before  participating  in  a  Coronet  mission.  (T-2).    Formation  leaders  and  mission commanders  (MCs)  will  ensure  all  formation  actions  have  been  properly  briefed  and  are understood by all formation members. (T-2).  All aircrews in the formation must be prepared to assume formation lead responsibilities. (T-2). 3.4.4.  A tanker MC will be identified on all active Coronet legs IAW AFI 11-2MDS Volume 3-specific instructions. (T-2).  Tanker MCs are responsible for the safe and effective conduct of  Coronet  missions,  and  will  perform  duties  IAW  AFI  11-2MDS  Volume  3-specifics AFI11-221  13 JULY 2016 11 instructions  and  618  AOC  (TACC)  guidance.  (T-1).    Tanker  MCs  will  monitor  weather  at receiver abort bases, destination, and alternates and provide timely updates to receiver flight lead.  (T-1).    Tanker  MCs  will  ensure  all  formation  actions  have  been  properly  briefed  and understood by all formation members.  (T-2). 3.4.5.  The ACC AOS Delivery Control Officer (DCO) normally conducts a mission briefing prior  to  each  Coronet  mission  leg.    This  briefing  is  normally  given  within  24  hours  of departure and provides detailed receiver mission information.  Tanker crews and MCs should attend this briefing if co-located and mission timing permits. (T-2). 3.4.6.  One 24-hour delay (slip) per Coronet is authorized for missions that do not launch as scheduled,  as  long  as  CAAP  tanker  capacity  exists.    Additional  delays  may  require rescheduling the mission.  Supporting tanker units will be released upon 618 AOC (TACC) approval. (T-2). 3.5.  Tanker  Go/No-Go  Launch  Decisions.  Coronet tanker launch decisions are made by 618 AOC (TACC), in conjunction with the mission commander, prior to tanker launch time. 3.6.  Tanker  Escort  Procedures.  Tankers  will  escort  receiver  aircraft  on  trans-oceanic  legs until  receivers  can  maintain  two-way  radio  communication  with  ATC  and  navigate  to  their destination or abort base. (T-1).  For a mid-ocean rendezvous, tankers will escort receivers until the receivers have confirmed two-way radio communications and positive radar or visual contact with  the  joining  tankers.  (T-1).    Plan  rendezvous  with  joining  tankers  so  that  receivers  move forward  to  complete  the  hand-off  whenever  possible.    Plan  to  perform  formation  breakups  in visual  conditions  prior  to  weather  penetration.    When  escorting  fighters  to  landing  location, tankers should land last. 3.7.  Abort and Divert Procedures.  When fighter aircraft are required to abort or divert, tanker MCs and ACs must ensure they understand the intentions and capabilities of aborting/diverting aircraft in order to provide proper escort support. (T-2). 3.7.1.  For air aborts, aborting aircraft will notify the tanker MC of their requirements. (T-2). Tankers  will  provide  information  (e.g.  arrival  weather  and  ATC  data)  and  other  necessary escort  support  to  aborting  receivers.  (T-2).    Tanker  MC  will  notify  618  AOC  (TACC)  as soon as practical. 3.7.2.  The fighter flight lead will notify the tanker MC in an emergency.  Tankers will notify ATC and obtain necessary clearances for non-emergency aircraft.  If a fighter aircraft ditches or goes down, tanker aircraft will provide cover as long as fuel reserves allow.  Remaining fighter aircraft will continue on the mission with remaining tankers or proceed unescorted to the nearest abort base.  Tanker MC will notify 618 AOC (TACC) AR Execution Cell as soon as practical. (T-1) 3.8.  Foreign  Military  Sales.  Coronets  must  have  a  valid  FMS  case  code  or  Acquisition  and Cross-Servicing  Agreement  (ACSA).  (T-0).    Coronet  Detail  Planners  will  ensure  all  FMS electronic  mission  folders  have  appropriate  FMS-specific  instructions.  (T-2).    FMS  case  will reimburse tanker flying hours, fuel offloaded, and flight crew Per Diem. (T-0). 3.9.  Coronet  Detail  Planners.  Planners  who  are  qualified  in  mobility  aircraft  may  fly  as  additional  crew  member,  IAW  AMC  directives,  when  traveling  with  Coronets.    Coronet  detail planners who were previously qualified in mobility aircraft, but no longer maintain qualification, 12 AFI11-221  13 JULY 2016 are  authorized  to  travel  using  MEP  status  IAW  AFI  11-401,  Aviation  Management,  and/or Command Supplement.  Coronet detail planners, traveling in MEP status on active Coronet legs, are exempt from any requirements to process through the passenger terminal, since they require direct access to tanker flight crews during mission planning, filing, and preflight. AFI11-221  13 JULY 2016 13 Chapter 4 ARLO PROGRAM 4.1.  The  Air  Refueling  Liaison  Office.  The  ARLO  program  is  administered  by  618  AOC (TACC).  It is an Air Refueling Optimization Program developed to ensure the most efficient use of  limited  air  refueling  resources  through  internet  technology  enabled,  standardized  processes.  ARLO  provides  enterprise-wide  visibility  of  both  tanker  capacity  and  emerging  receiver  AR training  requests.    The  ARLO  program  uses  the  ARST  and  acts  as  a  “clearinghouse”  for  all priority  3  and  4  AR  training  requests.    They  schedule  regional  business  efforts  and  coordinate with tankers/receivers located within a region to maximize efficiencies. 4.2.  Air Refueling Scheduling Tool.  The ARST was designed to work within and enhance the existing tanker-receiver unit relationships  through which the majority of  CJCS priority 3 and 4 AR  training  missions  are  created.  This  web-based  tool  is  the  USAF  system  of  record  for matching  receiver  training  air  refueling  needs  to  tanker  capacity,  and  its  use  is  mandatory  to maintain  visibility  and  allow  the  ARLO  to  maximize  training  opportunities.    ARST  is  a  user-friendly,  web  based  system  that  is  easily  accessed  from  any  “dot-mil”  account  and  requires minimal training.  “How to” guides for both tanker and receiver units are available for download from  the  Mobility  Air  Forces  Operations  website    https://mafops.us.af.mil/    under  the  AR scheduling  tab,  home  section.    If  assistance  is  needed  the  ARLO  is  available  M-F  0730-1630 CST at DSN 779-7613. 4.3.  To  ensure  maximum  visibility,  receiver  units  will  enter  all  CJCS  priority  3  &  4 training mission requests into the ARST (except CJCS priority 3 & 4 Coronets).  (T-2).  All tanker units will use the ARST to "buy" these requests. Tanker units are required to build all unit training missions in GDSS and provide "AR Details" when AR is performed.  JOHN W.
