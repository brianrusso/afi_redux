General.  Units  selected  by  their  MAJCOM  will  certify  aircrews  and  ground  support personnel for FARP operations using the guidance in this instruction.  (T-2) 1.1.1.  FARP  is  the  overall  mission  with  the  primary  purpose  of  transferring  fuel  from  a tanker  aircraft  with  one  or  more  engines  running.    The  FARP  aircraft  and  crew  bring  all required equipment to conduct the specific refueling operation, and will include some or all of  the  following:    refueling  hoses,  manifold  cart,  fire  extinguishers,  water  jugs,  and  hose deployment  personnel  (HDP).    Hot  refueling  is  receiving  fuel  from  any  source  with  one  or more engines operating.  Hot refueling includes fuel transfer from internal aircraft fuel tanks, auxiliary  tanks,  or  internally  loaded  fuel  bladders,  such  as  the  Aerial  Bulk  Fuels  Delivery System  (ABFDS)  with  or  without  Alternate  Capability  Equipment  (ACE).    When  the ABFDS is equipped with ACE, fuel transfer to another aircraft is possible.  FARP operations are  normally  conducted  at  night  in  an  austere  environment.    A  comprehensive  mission briefing and strict compliance to guidance and procedures will ensure an expeditious and safe refuel or defuel operation.  (T-2) 1.2.  Requirements.  The  following  actions  are  mandatory  prior  to  any  type  aircraft  being employed in FARP or hot refueling operations: 1.2.1.  A  System  Safety  Engineering  Analysis  (SSEA)  of  the  operation  is  performed  by AFMC/SES  in  coordination  with  the  MAJCOM  safety  office.    Reference  TO  00-25-172, Ground  Servicing  of  Aircraft  and  Static  Grounding/Bonding,  and  AFI  91-202,  The  US  Air Force Mishap Prevention Program.  AFMC/SES is the approval authority for SSEA reports.  (T-2) 1.2.1.1.  Technical  data  for  performing  these  operations,  including  appropriate  aircrew procedural  checklists,  are  written,  validated  (validation  often  occurs  in  association  with the SSEA), and published.  (T-2) 1.2.2.  The following actions are mandatory prior to the employment of FARP operations by designated unit personnel: 1.2.2.1.  The  requirements  of  Paragraph  1.2  are  completed  for  designated  unit  aircraft type. 1.2.2.2.  Completion and certification of FARP site survey.  (T-2) 1.2.2.3.  MAJCOM  certification  of  unit  execution  of  required  training  using  the MAJCOM or unit produced training program.  (T-2) 1.2.2.4.  MAJCOM certification of initial  cadre personnel  performing FARP operations.  (T-2) 1.3.  Waivers.  Waiver  authority  for  the  contents  of  this  instruction  is  MAJCOM/A3.    The MAJCOM  processing  the  waiver  will  coordinate  with  all  participating  MAJCOMs  possessing aircraft, equipment, and personnel involved in the FARP operation.  (T-2) 1.3.1.  Tier requirements refer to waiver authority based on level of risk. AFI11-235  8 APRIL 2015   5  1.3.1.1.  Tier  0”  (T-0):    Requirement  has  been  determined  by  non-AF  authority;  waiver authority is non-applicable or external to AF.   Non-compliance  with 1.3.1.2.  “Tier  1”  (T-1): this  requirement  puts  Airmen, commanders  or  the  USAF  strongly  at  risk  of  mission  or  program  failure,  death,  injury, legal  jeopardy  or  unacceptable  fraud,  waste  or  abuse.    The  waiver  authority  is  the MAJCOM/CC, delegable no lower than MAJCOM Director, with the concurrence of the AFI Certifying Official. 1.3.1.3.  “Tier  2”    (T-2):    Non-compliance  with  this  requirement  may  degrade  mission  or program  effectiveness  or  efficiency  and  has  potential  to  create  moderate  risk  of  mission  or program  failure,  injury,  legal  jeopardy  or  unacceptable  fraud,  waste  or  abuse.    The  waiver authority is the MAJCOM/CC (delegable no lower than MAJCOM Director). 1.3.1.4.  “Tier  3”    (T-3):    Non-compliance  with  this  requirement  may  limit  mission  or program effectiveness or efficiency and has a relatively remote potential to create risk of mission or program failure, injury, legal jeopardy or unacceptable fraud, waste, or abuse.  The waiver authority is the Wing / DRU / FOA CC (delegable no lower than Group/CC or equivalent).   6  AFI11-235  8 APRIL 2015 Chapter 2 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.

(T-2)    Exception:    The  frequency  of  use  is  not  restricted  for  temporary  sites certified  for  combat/contingency  operations  and  do  not  require  permanent  certification; however,  units  will  ensure  no  changes  have  occurred  on  the  ground  prior  to  returning  to  a previously certified site.  (T-2) 3.5.  Environmental  Impact  Analysis  (Temporary  Site).  The  airfield  manager  will  confirm that  all  local  environmental  standards  and  criteria  have  been  met.    Exercise  sponsor  is responsible for ensuring that the environmental impact analysis has been completed. 3.6.  Certification  Criteria.  Consider  the  following  criteria  when  conducting  FARP  site certification: 3.6.1.  Minimum  distance  between  tanker/receiver  aircraft  and  aircraft  parking  areas, buildings,  and  mass  refueling/unit  parking  area  is  200  feet  as  prescribed  in  TO  00-25-172, Table 3-2 (see Attachment 2).  (T-2) 3.6.2.  Distance between refueling aircraft and taxiing aircraft is 50 feet; however, part of any aircraft may pass within 50 feet of a FARP operation as long as the operating engines of the taxiing aircraft do not penetrate the 50-foot criteria as prescribed in TO 00-25-172, Table 3-2 (see Attachment 2).  (T-2) 3.7.  FARP Layout: 3.7.1.  Minimum  distance  between  tanker  Single  Point  Refueling  (SPR)  and  receiver  SPR will  be  300  feet  (see  Attachment  2).    (T-2)  Exception:    Modified  Two  point  (A/MH-6 receivers only) will be 200 feet.  (T-2) 3.7.2.  Minimum  distance  between  refueling  points  is  200  feet  (See  Attachment  2).    (T-2) Exception:  Minimum  distance between refueling points when refueling  two fixed wing or two V-22 receiver aircraft will be 400 feet.  (T-2) 3.7.3.  When able consider positioning tanker aircraft 45°off centerline.  This should reduce engine blast sustained by the Hot Refueling Supervisor (HRS), HDPs and receiver aircraft. 3.7.4.  Make  every  effort  to  position  Forward  Area  Manifold  (FAM)  Cart  and  refueling points  on  hard  surface.    Mission  scenario  and  FARP  site  location  will  dictate  placement  of FAM Cart and refueling points.  (T-2)   12  AFI11-235  8 APRIL 2015 3.7.5.  Certify site for the largest type tanker aircraft and the maximum number of refueling points  the  site  can  support.    Consider  the  length,  width  and  weight  bearing  capacity  of runway and FARP site.  (T-2) 3.7.6.  Certify site for the largest type rotary/tiltrotor receiver aircraft.  Consider the V-22 as the  largest  rotary/tiltrotor  receiver  aircraft  and  if  able  certify  the  site  for  V-22  and  smaller.  (T-2) Note:  Current FARP surveys that authorize C-130 tanker (or larger) to C-130 receiver, requires no written or verbal approval to FARP the V-22 as a single receiver. 3.7.7.  Ensure  area  will  allow  spilled  fuel  to  drain  away  from  the  aircraft  and  FARP equipment.  Spilled fuel will not be allowed to drain into a stream, river, or drainage ditch.  Servicing within 120 feet of drainage ditches/low lying areas and pressurized fuel servicing components shall be avoided due to explosive fuel vapor accumulation (see Attachment 2).  (T-2) 3.7.8.  Emergency  Egress  and  Reassemble  Area.    Ensure  both  tanker  and  receiver  aircraft have a minimum unobstructed egress distance of 1,000 feet to taxi from the FARP site in the event  of  an  emergency.    Rotary-wing/Tiltrotor  aircraft  may  have  a  flyaway  egress  route  in lieu  of  taxi  distance.    If  the  distance  is  less  than  1,000  feet  or  egress  area  is  obstructed, tanker/receiver aircraft will perform FARP in a cold environment only.  (T-2) 3.7.9.  Identify type surface (concrete, asphalt, clay, grass, dirt, etc.). 3.7.10.  Identify and list obstacles and hazards within the vicinity of the FARP site. 3.7.11.  Rescue  and  fire  coverage.    Ensure  vehicle  and  equipment  availability  for  largest aircraft using the site.  Ensure fuel spill response capability to include HAZMAT response.  The  installation  fire  chief/designated  representative  will  determine  the  best  location  to posture fire protection vehicles.  An Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) vehicle will be  on  scene  (or  on  alert  as  determined  by  the  base  fire  chief)  prior  to  commencing  FARP operations.  When required, the ARFF vehicle will be positioned in clear view of the FARP operation to monitor visual signals from FARP team members and if possible, maintain radio contact with the ST controller, tanker/receiver aircraft, or tower.  (T-2) Note:  For exercises and contingencies ARFF coverage may not be available. 3.7.11.1.  When  performing  FARP  operations,  always  position  a  fire  extinguisher, minimum  of one 20-pound dry  chemical or  equivalent, in  the immediate vicinity of the tanker SPR panel, at each receiver point, and at the FAM Cart, when used.  (T-2) 3.7.11.2.  When  the  site  specific  contingency  plan  is  implemented  follow  AFI  10-2501, Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning and Operations.

FARP Site Survey Minimum Distance Criteria. Item Tanker Aircraft Receiver Aircraft Mass Refueling Unit Taxiing Aircraft Inhabited Buildings Aircraft Parking Areas/Uninhabited Buildings Drainage Ditches/Low Lying Areas/Pressurized Fuel Servicing Components Receiver Aircraft (Rotary Wing) Receiver Aircraft (Fixed Wing) Receiver Aircraft (Tiltrotor) Note: 200’ *50’ 200” 200’ 120’ **300’ **300’ **300’ 200’ *50’ 200” 200’ 120’ 200’ 400’ 400’ 1.  Distance criteria are measured as the closest distance between any part of an aircraft and building or facility involved.  For parking areas, measure from the closest authorized parking positions. 2.  Ensure both tanker and receiver aircraft have a minimum unobstructed egress distance of 1,000 feet to taxi from the FARP site in the event of an emergency.  Rotary-wing aircraft may have a flyaway egress route in lieu of taxi distance.  If the distance is less than 1,000 feet or egress area is obstructed, tanker/receiver aircraft will perform FARP in a cold environment only. *Part of an aircraft may pass within 50 feet of a FARP operation as long as the operating engine(s) of the taxiing aircraft do not penetrate the 50-foot criteria. **Distance between tanker SPR and receiver SPR.  AFI11-235  8 APRIL 2015   25  Figure A2.1.
