As a trainer, the QTPs provide you with the breakdown of tasks into teachable elements. The teachable elements will help you to guide the trainee toward sufficient proficiency for task performance without assistance. QTPs are also used by the task certifiers/certification official to evaluate trainees concerning tasks which need third-party certification. 2. Review each volume and identify which modules of QTPs are needed for the trainee’s job position. Core task itemsare identified with the number “5” on the STS Column 2; these items are the minimum mandatory skills which are required for all 4N0X1 personnel to be proficient in performing. You have the flexibility to arrange training for each module in the order that you decide. 3. Review the subject-area tasks in each module with the trainee. Direct the trainee to review the training references togain a better understanding of the objective for each module. If the trainee has any questions about the objective, clarify the behavior that is expected in the objective. Review the performance checklist with the trainee, and allow him/her sufficient time to learn each step (some objectives may take longer to teach). Remember--the objective of each QTP is to standardize training and to allow sufficient time for the trainee to learn each task thoroughly in order to perform the task without assistance. 4. When the trainee receives sufficient training and is ready to be evaluated on an objective, follow the evaluationinstructions. The performance checklist must be used as you evaluate each task objective. When the trainee successfully accomplishes the objective, document task completion appropriately in AFTR. The QTP task completion is to be annotated on AF Form 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training,5.filed in Part 3, Section B in AFTR. NOTE: The individual checklists are not filed in each member’s AFTR. A master checklist is filed in Part 3, Section B of the hardcopy Master Training Plan (MTP) folder. If the trainee does not accomplish the objective, review the areas which need remediation. Conduct a feedback6.concerning each module with the trainee, and document appropriately in AFTR. As the trainer, when you are satisfied that the trainee is qualified to perform the task, he/she will be re-evaluated until the objective is met. 7.If the task which is being trained requires third-party certification by a task certifier/certifying official, the trainerfirst must ensure that the trainee is qualified to perform the task without assistance. Then the trainee will be evaluated by a task certifier/certifying official. The tasks which require third-party certification are denoted with a “^” in Column 3E of the Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP). After third-party certification, training qualification is documented appropriately in AFTR. The QTPs are a necessary tool for standardizing refresher/sustainment training. Such standardization will benefit8.the CFETP training concept throughout each member’s career. These documents also will be utilized for assessing/certifying the Aerospace Medical Service Specialist each time that he/she is assigned to a new duty position. The QTP developers’ goal is to publish a usable document for certifying officials, trainers, and trainees for the purpose of enhancing on-the-job training for Aerospace Medical Service Specialty personnel. We value your first-hand expertise, and we encourage your feedback.

EQUIPMENT REQUIRED: Blood pressure cuff (appropriate size), Noninvasive blood pressure monitor (optional), Stethoscope (if blood pressure will be taken manually), Clock with second hand (if pulse will be taken manually)  TRAINING REFERENCE(s): Mosby's Nursing Skills/Kx, current edition, Postural Vital Signs  REMARKS/NOTES: Vital signs must be taken in the same extremity for each of the three readings. A difference of 5 to 10 mmHg is common with blood pressure readings between arms. Normal range for blood pressure: Systolic – 95-140 mmHg Diastolic – 60-90 mmHg The systolic pressure is expected to fall 10 to 15 mmHg and the diastolic pressure is expected to rise slightly (by 5 mmHg) when changing between positions for orthostatic vital signs.  OBJECTIVE: Given the training resources and trainer demonstration, perform orthostatic vital signs measurement IAW the attached Aerospace Medical Service Specialty Performance Checklist Volume 1, Fundamentals of Nursing Care, Module 2, Postural Vital Signs Measurement.  EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS: 1. After the trainee has received instruction and has observed the task demonstration, allow sufficient practice time for each task element.

Verify physician’s order. 2. Gather supplies/equipment. 3. Perform hand hygiene. 4. Verify the correct patient using two identifiers per institution policy.  5. Determine the patient's medication history, because certain medications—such as sympatholytic drugs, diuretics, nitrates, narcotics, antihistamines, psychotropic agents, barbiturates, antihypertensive, and anticholinergics—can predispose a patient to orthostatic hypotension in the absence of hypovolemia.  6. Have the patient lie in a supine position for 5 to 10 minutes before taking the initial measurements. Prevent unreliable results by avoiding invasive or painful procedures during the measurement of postural vital signs.  7. Measure blood pressure and heart rate after the patient has been in a supine position for 5 to 10 minutes. Be sure to use the appropriate size of blood pressure cuff. The correct cuff size is determined by arm circumference.  8. Have the patient move from the supine to the standing position. If the patient is unable to stand for a blood pressure measurement, try either the high Fowler or the sitting position, although the results may be less credible. A supine-to-standing measurement is more accurate than a supine-to-sitting measurement.  9. Question the patient about weakness, dizziness, or visual dimming associated with a change of position. Note any pallor or diaphoresis. These symptoms are as important as the measurement of vital signs. Terminate the measurement if the patient becomes extremely dizzy and needs to lie down or experiences syncope.  10. Take the standing or sitting blood pressure (in the same arm as the initial readings), and determine the heart rate at 1 and 3 minutes after the position change. Support the patient's forearm at heart level when taking the blood pressure to prevent an inaccurate measurement. When measuring orthostatic vital signs, one or more of the following findings may indicate intravascular volume loss in adults:     a. Decrease in systolic blood pressure of 20 mm Hg or more.     b. Decrease in diastolic blood pressure of 10 mm Hg or more.     c. Increase in heart rate of 20 bpm or more.                                                               10 Vol.1 Module 2                                                                     Postural Vital Signs Measurement (cont)      11. If an intermediate sitting measurement was taken, have the patient move into the standing position and repeat the two previous steps.  12. Return the patient to a supine or sitting position.          13. Monitor for the resolution of symptoms such as dizziness, visual changes, or hypotension if any occurred during the measurement of postural vital signs.  14. Perform hand hygiene.  15. Document the results in the patient's record.  FINAL RESULT:                 NOTE: The evaluator will STOP the procedure immediately and correct the trainee if performance could become detrimental to personnel safety at any time.                               11 Volume 1                                                                                                                           Module 3 CARDIAC MONITOR SETUP AND LEAD PLACEMENT  SUBJECT AREA: Medical Examinations/Special Procedures  TASK NAMES: Set-up cardiac monitor/defibrillator.

V6 horizontal level to V4 at the midaxillary line 17. Attach the lead wires to the electrodes. 18. Turn the ECG machine on and program the machine.    a. Paper speed: 25 mm/sec    b. Calibration: 10 mm/mV    c. Filter settings: 0.05 to 100 Hz 19. Obtain a 12-lead ECG recording.    a. Instruct the patient to remain still while the machine senses and translates the electrical activity of the heart to electrical waveforms on paper.    b. Obtain a rhythm strip if needed. Refer to the manufacturer's manual for instructions on obtaining a rhythm strip. 20. Examine the 12-lead ECG tracing to ensure that it is clear; repeat the ECG if it is not clear. Obtain approval from provider for adequacy of strip to determine whether the recording must be repeated when the patient is still connected to the machine. 21. Disconnect the equipment, clean the gel off of the patient, and prepare the equipment for future use. Follow the manufacturer's directions and institution policy for electrode use and removal. 22. Discard supplies, remove gloves, and perform hand hygiene. 23. Document the procedure in the patient's record.
