ATARS Categories (defined): 2.2.4.1.  Military - Aircraft belonging to a nation's armed forces. 2.2.4.2.  General Aviation - Aircraft of any national registry operated by a private person, company, public company, government agency, or flying club not conducting air carrier or air taxi operations. 2.2.4.3.  Air Carrier or Air Taxi - Aircraft conducting operations for compensation or hire (e.g.,  World  Air,  Tower  Air,  DHL,  Federal  Express,  U.S.  Commercial  Airlines  and charter services such as Tango Cessna TN4426E). 2.2.4.4.  UAS  -  UAS  operations  controlled  from  a  location  other  than  the  aircraft. Includes operations conducted in IFR or VFR. 2.2.4.5.  HELO  -  Military  helicopter  operations.    Included  operations  conducted  in  IFR and VFR. 2.2.4.6.  Other - Operations wherein a VFR Tower receives a point-out for an IFR aircraft executing  an  instrument  approach  to  another  (adjacent)  airport  or  as  otherwise coordinated  and  approved  for  use  by  MAJCOM.  This  area  constitutes  a  non-countable category  and  values  tabulated  in  this  area  will  not  affect  the  "Type  Operations"  sub-categories totals (e.g., IFR arrivals, IFR departures, etc.). 8 AFMAN13-215V1  6 FEBRUARY 2014 2.2.5.  Type of Activity (defined): 2.2.5.1.  IFR Departure - IFR or Special VFR (SVFR) departures and IFR, SVFR or VFR aircraft flying an instrument approach that terminates in other than a full-stop landing and continues to receive IFR service. 2.2.5.2.  IFR  Arrival  -  IFR,  SVFR  and  VFR  aircraft  that  fly  an  instrument,  visual,  or contact approach to an airport or point-in-space. 2.2.5.3.  VFR  Local  (Tower Only)  -  VFR  aircraft  that arrive or depart an airport  served by the control tower. 2.2.5.4.  VFR  Itinerant  (Tower  Only)  -  VFR  aircraft  that  originate  outside  Class  D airspace and fly through it without making an approach. 2.2.5.5.  VFR Service (Radar Only) - VFR aircraft that receive services but do not make an instrument approach. 2.2.5.6.  Overflight - IFR or SVFR aircraft that originate outside the area of jurisdiction and  fly  through  the  area  without  flying  an  approach.    For  ATARS  purposes,  “area  of jurisdiction”  is  defined  as  the  total  designated/depicted  airspace  (lateral  and  vertical) boundaries  over  which  an  ATC  facility  has  authority,  including  all  subdivided  sectors.  Aircraft transitioning the area of jurisdiction will not  be counted as multiple overflights and/or  Special-Use  Airspace  activities  when  tabulating  one  aircraft’s/flight’s  route  of flight. 2.2.5.7.  Special Use  - Aircraft that conduct  activities in  airspace of defined dimensions identified  by  an  area  on  the  surface  of  the  earth  wherein  activities  must  be  confined because  of  their  nature  and/or  wherein  limitations  may  be  imposed  upon  aircraft operations that are not a part of those activities. 2.2.5.7.1.  Count  activities  conducted  in  alert  areas,  controlled  firing  areas,  Military Operating  Areas  (MOAs),  prohibited  areas,  restricted  areas,  and  warning  areas  as special use operations. 2.2.5.7.2.  Any other area/activity not listed requires MAJCOM approval. 2.2.5.7.3.  Counting  of  SUA  operations  will  only  occur  when  an  aircraft/flight employs the SUA  intended purpose. 2.2.5.7.4.  Use  of  multiple  sectors  within  the  same  MOA  by  the  same  aircraft/flight will only be counted as one SUA operation.  This includes aircraft/flights authorized to  work  combined  sectors  within  the  same  MOA,  or  those  which  transition  from working  one  sector  to  working  another  sector  within  the  same  MOA.    Exception:  When  elements  of  a  flight  operating  in  assigned  SUA  require  separate  ATC identification  and  services,  count  each  operation  as  a  separate  SUA  activity.    For counting purposes, the key determinant is after flight split-up, each element requires separate ATC identification and services apart from previous flight activities.  In this case,  count  each  operation  as  separate  SUA  activity  using  the  provisions  of  this paragraph. 2.2.5.8.  An aircraft/flight may be counted as either an overflight or a SUA activity, but not both. AFMAN13-215V1  6 FEBRUARY 2014 9 2.2.6.  Type of Approach (defined): 2.2.6.1.  PAR - Any aircraft that conducts a PAR approach. 2.2.6.2.  ASR - Any aircraft that conducts an ASR approach. 2.2.6.3.  Instrument  Landing System (ILS) or Microwave Landing System (MLS)  - Any aircraft that conducts an ILS or MLS approach. 2.2.6.4.  Tactical  Air  Navigation  (TACAN)  -  Any  aircraft  that  conducts  a  TACAN approach. 2.2.6.5.  Area Navigation (RNAV) - Any aircraft that conducts an RNAV approach. 2.2.6.6.  Global Positioning System (GPS) - Any aircraft that conducts a GPS approach.  HARRY C.
