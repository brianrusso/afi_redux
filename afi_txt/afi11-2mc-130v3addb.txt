General.  Those  who  use  this  instruction  should  bear  in  mind  that  an  infinite  number  of variations  are  available  and  that  the  cargo  compartment  configurations  listed  here  are  the  most typical encountered day-to-day. 1.1.1.  Tier requirements refer to waiver authority based on level of risk. 1.1.1.1.  “Tier  1”  (T-1)  requirements  are  reserved  for  requirements  that  non-compliance may  put  airman  or  mission  strongly  at  risk,  and  may  only  be  waived  by  the MAJCOM/CC or delegate.  This AFI contains Tier 1 requirements. 1.1.1.2.  “Tier 2” (T-2) requirements are reserved for requirements that potentially put the mission at risk or potentially degrade the mission or program, and may only be waived by the MAJCOM/CC or delegate. 1.1.1.3.  “Tier  3”  (T-3)  requirements  are  reserved  for  requirements  that  non-compliance has  a  remote  risk  of  mission  failure,  and  may  be  waived  by  the  Wing/CC  but  no  lower than the OG/CC.  There are no Tier 3 requirements in this AFI. 1.2.  Responsibilities.  Personnel  engaged  in  planning  operations  must  consider  the  most appropriate configuration that will satisfy mission requirements and permit minimum variations and  man-hours  to  change.    Units  performing  services  on  the  MC-130H  aircraft  (e.g., maintenance,  aircrew  flight  equipment)  are  responsible  for  configuring  the  aircraft  IAW  this instruction and as outlined in mission directives to include the stowage/installation of equipment IAW the configuration and equipment tables outlined herein.  (T-2) 1.3.  Codes.  Use  the  following  codes  when  referring  to  MC-130H  cargo  compartment configuration.  The letter code will be followed by a number identifying configuration capability.  (T-2) 1.3.1.  AE - Aeromedical Evacuation 1.3.2.  C - Cargo 1.3.3.  CP - Cargo and Passengers 1.3.4.  LP - PSYOPS 1.3.5.  P - Passenger 1.3.6.  RAPID - Infil/Exfil Equipment or Personnel 1.3.7.  TAC - Tactical Airdrop Cargo 1.3.8.  TAP - Tactical Airdrop Personnel 1.4.  Modifications.  The coded configurations of this regulation may require modification for a specific  mission.    Each  modification  must  be  carefully  evaluated  prior  to  mission  execution  to ensure maximum flight safety and compatibility with aircraft equipment.  Each mission directive will identify the basic configuration by code and the modification, if necessary, to satisfy mission requirements.  For example, a cargo mission may require additional seats or equipment such as a   6  AFI11-2MC-130V3ADDB  20 APRIL 2015 bulldog winch not in the C-cargo configuration.  Indicate the mission directive configuration C (number as applicable) and modification, e.g., two additional seats and bulldog winch required.  (T-2) 1.5.  Weight and Balance. 1.5.1.  Configuration  and  necessary  equipment  changes  to  conduct  special  operations missions  affect  the  weight  and  balance  of  the  aircraft.    To  standardize  equipment  and  the location of equipment, items shown in Table 2.1 will be included in the basic weight of the aircraft  and  remain  on  the  aircraft  except  for  maintenance,  inspection  and  when  removal  is directed by this AFI.  Equipment listed in Table 2.2 will be added as necessary and entered on DD Form 365-4, Weight and Balance Clearance Form F – Transport/Tactical, reference 5, 6, or 7.  For simplicity the loadmaster will (when preparing the DD Form 365-4 Form F) enter  the  weight  contained  in  the  equipment  tables  for  the  applicable  configuration.  Adjustments  will  be  made  when  the  actual  on-board  weight  of  an  item  varies  from  data shown.  DD Form 365-4 will be completed IAW instructions in Chapter 5.  (T-2) 1.5.2.  When a configuration change that removes items listed in Table 2.1 is accomplished at a Forward Operating Location (FOL) and no Quality Assurance Branch (QA) weight and balance authority is deployed to the location, maintenance personnel will put an info note in the  AFTO  Form  781A,  Maintenance  Discrepancy  and  Work  Document,  indicating  the weight,  fuselage station  and moment  of any  equipment  added or removed.  The loadmaster will add or subtract the listed weight and moment from the last entry in the DD Form 365-3, Chart  C  –  Basic  Weight  and  Balance  Record.    Annotate  the  new  weight  and  moment  in Block  1  of  DD  365-4.    Configuration  changes  accomplished  at  home  station  require  a  QA update  to  the  DD  Form  3653.    Exception:    Minor  equipment  changes  after  crew  reporting may be annotated on the DD Form 365-4, by the loadmaster.  (T-2) 1.6.  Distribution.  Commanders are responsible for bringing this publication to the attention of all affected personnel.  At least one copy will be maintained in the unit operations section.  It will be  readily  accessible  to  operations  and  aircrew  personnel.    Additional  distribution  will  be  as follows: (T-2) 1.6.1.  Staff operations, all levels. 1.6.2.

This chapter contains reference data to assist personnel in load planning. 4.2.  Emergency  Exits  and  Safety  Aisles.  Load  aircraft  in  such  a  manner  that  the  following emergency exits and safety aisles are available. 4.2.1.  At least one cabin emergency exit is unobstructed. 4.2.2.  At least  one unobstructed emergency  exit is  available for each 20  passengers/troops.  This does not restrict overwater flights if the three overhead escape hatches are available for egress.    Litters  and  seats  erected  across  an  emergency  exit  are  not  considered  as  an obstruction. 4.2.3.  When passengers are being airlifted, an unobstructed aisle way will be maintained in the wheel-well (pallet positions 3 & 4) and ramp area (pallet position 6) to provide access to emergency exits.  In the wheel-well area the aisle way will be a minimum of 14 inches wide between the outer edge of the cargo and the aircraft and will begin at the cargo floor (Figure 4.1  A).  Tie-down equipment (463L nets, straps, chains, and devices) shall not normally be considered an obstruction.  The aisle way should normally be on the left side of the aircraft.  If the aisle way is placed on the right side of the aircraft, then clearance to the right side of the  aircraft  must  be  maintained.    The  dual  rail  outboard  frame  provides  8  inches  of  the  14 inch requirement on the main cargo floor.  In the ramp area the aisle way will be a minimum of  8  inches  beginning  at  the  outboard  edge  of  the  dual  rail  frame.    Access  to  aft  latrine facilities requires an 18-inch clear area on the forward right side of the cargo loaded on the ramp.  (T-2) 4.2.4.  If  safety  aisle  requirements  in  Paragraph  4.2.3  cannot  be  achieved  on  missions carrying  crew  only  or  mission  essential  personnel  authorized  by  operations  order/plan  or Commander Air Force Special Operations Forces (COMAFSOF), then a safety aisle will be maintained in the wheel-well area to provide the following minimum clearance: (T-2) 4.2.4.1.  At least 14 inches between the outer edge of the cargo and the aircraft beginning no higher than 36 inches above the floor/pallet/platform. 4.2.4.2.  Or a minimum of 30 inches between the outer edge of the cargo and the aircraft beginning no higher than 60 inches above the floor/pallet/platform. 4.2.5.  During  airdrop  missions,  loadmasters  shall  have  access  to  the  rear  of  the  aircraft  to accomplish tactical checklists.  (T-2) 4.2.6.  On all missions, cargo will be loaded in such a way that the crew will have access to the rear of the aircraft.  The aircraft commander will be the final authority for determining if safety  aisles  and/or  access  aft  of  cargo  is  adequate.    Cargo  loads  in  Section  VI  of  TO  1C-130A-9 are specific and do not require a waiver.  (T-2) AFI11-2MC-130V3ADDB  20 APRIL 2015   39  Figure 4.1.  Wheel-Well Safety Aisle. Table 4.1.

Introduction.  This  chapter  provides  instructions  for  computation  and  completion  of  the DD Form 365-4.    The  Form  F  will  be  computed  using  simplified  moments.    All  entries  and signatures must be legible.  (T-2) 5.2.  Load Planning.  The cargo load must be planned so that the center of gravity (CG) of the loaded  aircraft  will  be  within  the  specified  forward  and  aft  limits  for  any  given  operating condition.  Consideration must be given to offload sequence, aircraft limitations, and emergency jettisoning.  (T-2) 5.3.  General Instructions.  These instructions apply to forms using simplified moments. 5.3.1.  DD  Form  365-4  Heading.    Enter  date,  mission  number,  aircraft  type,  serial  number, departure  and  destination  station  (name  or  international  civil  aviation  organization  (ICAO) identifier), aircraft’s home station and pilot's rank and last name. 5.3.2.  Limitations Column.  Enter appropriate weight and CG limits for the planned mission using  the  following  criteria:    The  maximum  gross  weight  and  CG  limits  specified  in TO 1C130(M)H-1, Flight Manual MC-130H, will not be exceeded.  Gross weight may also be limited by operating conditions; i.e., obstacle clearance, rate-of-climb, weather conditions, altitude,  runway/taxiway  bearing  capacity,  or  any  other  published  restrictions.    The pilot/flight  engineer will inform  the loadmaster of any  gross  weight  restrictions prior to  the mission so an accurate allowable cabin load (ACL) may be obtained.  (T-2) 5.3.2.1.  Takeoff  ACL.    Unless  other  restrictions  are  imposed,  use  155,000  allowable gross  weight  for  MC-130  aircraft,  and  subtract  the  total  aircraft  weight  (Reference  12).  (T-2) 5.3.2.2.  Landing  ACL.    Unless  other  landing  restrictions  are  imposed,  use  155,000  for MC130 aircraft, and subtract operating weight plus estimated landing fuel (References 9 and 23).  (T-2) 5.3.2.3.  Limiting  Wing  Fuel.    Compute  IAW  limiting  wing  fuel  charts  in  Table  5.1  of this instruction or the charts in Section V of TO 1C-130(M)H-1 for takeoff and landing.  The  most  restrictive  weight  will  be  used.    Note:    The  limiting  wing  fuel  chart  in  this instruction is based on a 2.5 G maneuver load factor with indicated airspeed restrictions outlined  in  area  "C"  of  the  flight  manual  limiting  wing  fuel  charts.    When  specific mission requirements exceed the limitations outlined in area "C" of the limiting wing fuel charts,  the  loadmaster  must  compute  limitations  using  the  appropriate  flight  manual limiting  wing  fuel  chart  in  Section  V  of  TO 1C130(M)H1.    (T-2)    Note:    Enter  the allowable  gross  weight  for  limiting  wing  fuel  and  subtract  the  operating  weight (Reference 9) to determine limiting wing fuel ACL. 5.3.2.4.  Permissible  CG  Takeoff  and  Landing.    Compute  the  forward  and  aft  center  of gravity  limitations  using  the  center  of  gravity  table  in  TO  1C-130(M)H-5,  Handbook, Basic  Weight  Checklist  and  Loading  Data.    The  permissible  CG  and  zero  fuel  weight blocks will be left blank.  (T-2)   46  AFI11-2MC-130V3ADDB  20 APRIL 2015 5.3.3.  Signature Block: 5.3.3.1.

Table  5.1  may  be  used  to  determine  maximum  limiting  wing  fuel ACL  for  a  given  fuel  load  when  in  primary  fuel  management.    Comply  with  the  requirements outlined  in  Paragraph  5.5.1  when  using  Table  5.1.    Fuel  weights  are  expressed  in  thousands.  For  fuel  weights  between  chart  weights,  go  to  nearest  fuel  weight  to  determine  base  weight.  Both takeoff and landing conditions must be calculated.  The most restrictive will be placed on the DD-365-4.  (T-2) 5.5.1.  Instructions  for  primary  fuel  management.    Table  5.1  is  based  on  the  recommended areas  (Areas  A,  B,  and  C)  of  the  Weight  Limitations  Chart  (Primary  Fuel  Management) (Non-Air  Refueling  Mission,  Non  MCARS  aircraft)  With  Foam  In  Fuel  Tanks.    For Operations  that  do  not  meet  these  criteria,  use  the  appropriate  chart  in  TO  1C-130(M)H-1, Section V, to determine ACL.  (T-2) Table 5.1.  Limiting Wing Fuel Primary Fuel.
