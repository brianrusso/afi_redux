Mission.  Provide  a  safe  and  effective  Aircrew  Flight  Equipment  (AFE)  Contingency Operations  program.    Protect  and  sustain  the  lives  of  aircrew  members  and  AFE  personnel during contingency operations. 1.2.  Program Objectives: 1.2.1.  Develop and prepare Aircrew Flight Equipment Superintendents (AFES), supervisors and technicians, to support, conduct, and sustain operations during exercises and real world contingencies. 1.2.2.  Aid  in  preparation,  deployment,  employment,  and  recovery  of  personnel  and equipment to support the full range of operational environments. 1.3.  Operational Environment 1.3.1.  An  operational  environment  (OE)  is  a  compilation  of  interrelated  conditions, circumstances,  and  influences  that  affect  the  employment  of  capabilities  and  bear  on decisions.  An assessment of the OE consists of a detailed analysis of the aircrew chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (ACBRN) threats and hazards and the political, military, economic,  social,  information,  infrastructure,  physical  environment  and  time  (PMESII-PT) variables. 1.3.2.  Threat and Hazard Assessments are used to assist commanders and planning functions in determining what threats or hazards may be faced at an installation or a deployed location. 1.3.3.  PMESII-PT  is  a  joint  systems  approach  that  allows  commanders,  planners,  and support  staff  to  understand  the  OE.    The  PMESII-PT  variables  provide  a  framework  for understanding, characterizing, and managing ACBRN threats and hazards specific to an OE. 1.3.4.  It is imperative that AFE personnel understand the OE to ensure proper equipment is deployed and postured appropriately to support AFE and customer needs.  Unit Intelligence activities  provide  the  proper  resources  to  gain  this  knowledge  needed  to  support  deployed operations. 1.3.5.  When  deploying  into  a  CBRN  area  or  OE  refer  to  AFMAN  11-301,  Aircrew  Flight Equipment (AFE) Operations in a Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Environment. 1.4.  Communications: 1.4.1.

(T-2) 3.2.  Deployment Requirements. 3.2.1.  AFE  sections  will  preassemble  mobility  packages  to  support  contingency  plans  and recurring  deployments  to  the  maximum  extent  possible  at  all  times.    Mobility  packages should  be  kept  in  a  “ready”  state  for  deployment  to  prevent  unnecessary  delays.  Additionally, these packages will be maintained to meet assigned UTC and LOGDET based on the MDS-specific pilot unit standards.  (T-2) 3.2.2.  When  units  are  deploying  with  other  units,  they  must  coordinate  with  each  other,  as well  as  their  respective  MAJCOMs,  to  ensure  appropriate  and  adequate  equipment  and supplies  are  deployed.    Units  will  contact  the  AFCENT  AFE  Functional  Manager  and  the AOR AFE Superintendent at the deployed location for additional location specific guidance and requirements. (T-2) 3.2.3.  Items maintained in mobility packages are separate and in addition to those possessed for normal day-to-day operations. (T-3) 3.2.4.  Mobility packages will be inventoried and inspected for serviceability before or after each use and at least once a year.  AF Form 2411, Inspection Document, a locally developed form,  or  Flight  Equipment  Records  Management  Systems  (FERMS)/Defense  Property Accountability System (DPAS) product will be used to document this inspection.  (T-2) 3.2.5.  Test  equipment,  time  change  items,  hazards,  accountable  equipment,  and  high  value items may be stored separate from the mobility bin.  (T-3) 3.2.6.  Ensure  mobility  Test  Measurement  and  Diagnostic  Equipment  (TMDE)  items  are placed on a WRM inspection cycle.  If TMDE items are not on a WRM inspection cycle the items, supporting the UTC should be calibrated to the maximum extent possible.  Inspection should  be  staggered  to  prevent  all  TMDE  coming  due  at  the  same  time.    TMDE  will  be carefully and adequately packaged to prevent damage.  Ensure mobility TMDE identified as WRM has inspection cycles established accordingly. (T-3) 3.2.7.  When SPINS or reporting instructions dictate, aircrews deploying into chemical threat areas will hand carry their individual fit ACBRN D-1 bag ensemble with them.  As directed, the  remainder  of  ACBRN  D-bags  will  be  shipped  with  the  rest  of  the  unit’s  equipment.  NOTE  –  Group  Commanders  may  direct  the  palletization  of  ACBRN  D-1  bags  when sufficient  space  on  the  aircraft  does  not  permit  these  bags  to  be  hand  carried  on  aircraft  or when there is not an immediate need for these assets at the deployed location. (T-2) 3.3.  Deployment Personnel Levels. 12 AFI11-301V3  1 FEBRUARY 2016 3.3.1.  Deployment  personnel  levels  are  determined  by  the  UTC's  tasked  commander  and deployed commanders, based on OPLANs, tasked UTCs, and capabilities and limitations at the  deployed  location.    Before  deploying,  units  must  review  their  requirements  to  ensure adequate personnel will be available. (T-2) 3.3.1.1.  An AFE supervisor, Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) 1P071 should be among the  first  to  deploy  on  the  advanced  echelon  (ADVON)  team.    This  person  is  tasked  to coordinate efforts with agencies necessary to establish AFE operations.  (T-2) 3.3.1.2.  AFE Superintendent  (E-7, E-8, or E-9) will deploy in  support of UTC 9ALCS.  Additional ACCA support will be tasked through UTC 9ALCW.  AFE CMSgts (1P000) will provide additional theater leadership through UTC 9ALCM. (T-2) 3.3.2.  When  operational  requirements  exceed  available  in-place  personnel,  the  AFE superintendent  will combine the efforts of deployed units under his  or her supervision.    In the  absence  of  a  designated  AFE  Superintendent,  the  senior  ranking  AFE  supervisor  will assume responsibility for actions normally taken by the superintendent. (T-2) 3.3.3.  Deployment  personnel  must be fully qualified  IAW CFETP  1P0X1 to  the maximum extent possible. (T-2) 3.3.4.  Personnel  postured  to  support  UTC  9ALCW  will  receive  initial  and  reoccurring training  on  all  ACBRN  related  core  tasks  identified  in  CFETP  1P0X1  (e.g.,  ACCA operations, equipment maintenance, etc…) regardless unit mission, location, and command. (T-1) 3.3.5.  ACCA Rapid Response teams will consist of 18 personnel tasked using UTC 9ALCW and one Shelter Manager tasked under UTC 9ALCS.  Based on current war plans, AFE will maintain sufficient funded military manpower positions to support 24 simultaneous locations.  (T-1) 3.4.  Deploying Aircrew Equipment. 3.4.1.  When mission requirements dictate, operations group commanders (or equivalent) are authorized  to  add  only  T.O.  authorized  or  MAJCOM  approved  survival  components  or increase  aircraft  equipment  configurations  provided  the  changes  complies  with  AFI  11-301 series  and  MDS  AFI.    This  instruction,  applicable  T.O.s,  and  allowance  standards  serve  as the basis of authorization to obtain equipment required to meet mission needs. (T-2) 3.4.2.  Ensure  AFE  deploying  into  combat  zones  has  accompanying  inspection  forms,  to include IPI forms.  Sanitization of equipment or inspection forms (on the equipment) of data pertaining  to  unit  of  assignment  or  activity  will  be  determined  by  combatant  commander guidance.  (T-2) 3.4.3.  All deploying aircrews will have individual equipment configured for combat prior to the first employment mission. (T-2)  Reference SPINS for the most current information. AFI11-301V3  1 FEBRUARY 2016 13 Chapter 4 PREPARATION, DEPLOYMENT AND EMPLOYMENT 4.1.  Purpose.  This chapter provides guidance for planning AFE tasks and workloads in support of the OPLAN.  It includes information on the pre-deployment actions and workloads associated with both home-station and deployment activities. 4.2.  General.  During increased tension, readiness levels will increase and deploying units will have  to  perform  specific  preparation  tasks  during  heightened  defense  condition  levels.    As  a minimum, AFE units will maintain the following documentation to assist mobility planning and preparations:  4.2.1.

Shelter Facilities 14 AFI11-301V3  1 FEBRUARY 2016 4.4.2.1.  AFE  is  the  designated  agency  for  ACCA  operations.    Before  any  deployment, AFE  personnel  will  contact  the  AFEO/AFES  of  the  deployed  unit  to  ask  questions concerning applicable processing procedures, capabilities, and other operational aspects. (T-2)  A review of the base support plan should also be conducted.  Personnel deploying to locations where shelter facilities already exist must recognize and be prepared for the considerable responsibilities they will have related to ACCA operations. 4.4.2.2.  AFE  personnel  deploying  to  locations  where  collective  protection  sheltering exists  will  be  responsible  for  coordinating  the  use  of  these  systems  with  the  deployed commander  and/or  Emergency  Operations  Center  (EOC).    Individuals  assigned  this responsibility  must  be  trained  and  qualified  through  the  436  TS  as  hardened,  semi-hardened, and transportable type processing systems have significant differences in their capabilities and operating procedures. (T-2) 4.4.3.  Unit AFE personnel will maintain individual aircrew sizing information in FERMS or DPAS,  and  be  prepared  for  the  responsibility  for  requisitioning,  fitting,  and  maintaining ACBRN  equipment,  and  be  readily  available  for  donning  and  doffing  operations  once deployed. (T-2) 4.4.4.  When  requested,  unit  AFES  personnel  will  provide  training  to  aircraft  maintenance personnel for donning of CB transient layer (i.e., overcapes and overboots, etc.). 4.5.  Deployment. 4.5.1.  The Deployment Phase of the operation will be the combination of preparation and a time-limited  execution  of  actions.    These  deployment  actions  will  normally  start  with  a tasking  notification  and  continue  until  all  AFE  personnel,  equipment  and  aircraft  have  left home  station.    Refer  to  USAF  AFE  SharePoint®  for  a  list  of  actions  and  items  to  be completed for deployment (forthcoming). 4.5.2.
