Introduction.  “If you lived here, you’d be home by now.”  We’ve all seen that sign outside military air installations.  Military airfields attract development – people who work on base want to  live  nearby  while  others  want  to  provide  services  to  base  employees  and  residents.    When incompatible development occurs near an installation or training area, affected parties within the community  may  seek  relief  through  political  channels  that  could  restrict,  degrade  or  eliminate capabilities  necessary  to  perform  the  defense  mission.    The  Department  of  Defense  (DoD) established  the  AICUZ  program  to  promote  proactive,  collaborative  planning  for  compatible development to sustain mission and community goals. 1.2.  The History of AICUZ. 1.2.1.  Most  Air  Force  installations  were  built  during  or  prior  to  the  1940s  in  relatively remote areas.  This remoteness allowed flight training, air combat maneuvering and bombing practice all in the same county.  In the years since, aircraft have steadily evolved from riveted aluminum-skinned  airframes  to  exotic  metal  and  composite  platforms  that  operate  at significantly higher speeds and generate exponentially more noise.  Today’s aircraft operate in all weather and take advantage of the night.  These aircraft can network together and strike targets over the horizon – where before, their training footprint may have been located within a single county, today’s aircraft often train over multiple states. 1.2.2.  While  Air  Force  aircraft  and  missions  have  evolved,  the  surrounding  communities have  not  stood  still.    Following  the  end  of  World  War  II  (WWII),  the  United  States population  surged,  riding  the  baby  boom  wave  of  the  late  ‘40s  and  early  ‘50s.    The population  of  the  United  States  grew  from  144  million  in  1947  when  the  Air  Force  was formally established, to 320 million in 2015.  The population spread out from urban centers, aided  by  the  National  Interstate  and  Defense  Highways  Act  of  1956.    Veterans  who  had trained  throughout  the  southwest  during  WWII,  returned  to  the  scorched  regions  tamed  by the  advent  of  air  conditioning,  establishing  thriving  communities  outside  once  remote military installations. 1.2.3.  The  origins  of  the  AICUZ  program  go  back  to  the  early  1950s  when  a  series  of civilian  aircraft  accidents  prompted  President  Truman  to  appoint  General  James  Doolittle (USAF  Ret.)  to  establish  a  commission  to  review  these  accidents  and  develop  flight  safety recommendations.  The  report, “The Airport and  Its  Neighbors,” included a comprehensive analysis  of  airport  land  use,  planning  and  airfield  safety  considerations,  including  effective zoning  regulations  to  control  land  use  near  airports.    The  report  noted  similarities  between civilian and military airports and their effects on surrounding communities. 1.2.4.  As early as 1957, the Air Force established procedures for estimating noise exposure and gauging community reaction to aircraft operations.  By 1964, the Air Force was working on the relationship  between land use planning and aircraft noise.  Even  then, the Air  Force recognized the need to address noise from a land use planning perspective. 1.2.5.  The  late  1960s  and  early  1970s  saw  the  beginning  of  the  environmental  movement.  Emphasis  on  incorporating  environmental  concerns  into  the  planning  process  was  a  major push.  Notable events included Air Force research on sonic boom exposure in the 1960s, the 6 AFH32-7084  2 NOVEMBER 2017 Federal  Aviation  Administration’s  (FAA)  civilian  aircraft  certification  requirement  and passage  of  the  National  Environmental  Policy  Act  (NEPA)  of  1969,  and  the  Noise  Control Act  of  1972.    These  developments  increased  DoD  awareness  of  noise  exposure  issues, encouraging the institutionalization of its programs. 1.2.6.  In  1971,  the  Air  Force  introduced  the  “Greenbelt”  concept  to  address  the  growing problem  of  incompatible  development  around  airfields  (encroachment).    The  idea  behind greenbelts  was  to  establish  buffer  zones  around  installations  through  the  purchase  of  real property.  For obvious cost and budget considerations, the concept proved to be economically infeasible. 1.2.7.  The Noise Control Act of 1972 initiated a Federal program to regulate noise pollution with the intent of protecting human health and minimizing annoyance of noise to the general public.  While this was a significant step forward in reducing the public’s exposure to aircraft noise,  the  Act  did  not  apply  to  military  weapons  or  equipment,  effectively  exempting  the DoD from having to comply. 1.2.8.  In 1973, DoD established the AICUZ program.  This program established policies and guidelines  to  protect  military  operational  capability.    It  accomplishes  this  goal  by  avoiding incompatible  development  that  would  prevent  military  installations  from  changing  or expanding operations to meet new mission requirements.  The Air Force and Navy released their first AICUZ studies in the mid-1970s followed by individual service instructions. 1.2.9.  Through  the  AICUZ  program,  the  Air  Force  has  been  successful  in  encouraging  the adoption  of  state-level  enabling  legislation  for  planning  compatible  development  around military  airfields  throughout  the  United  States,  including  Arizona,  Texas,  Florida,  and Alabama.    Other  states,  such  as  California,  have  adopted  legislation  after  recognizing  the need to  protect  all airfields from  encroachment.   The Air Force encourages the adoption of enabling  legislation  for  this  purpose  and  cooperates  with  the  appropriate  state  and  local authorities regarding its implementation. 1.3.  Program Objectives.  The goals of the AICUZ program are simple – to protect the health, safety  and  welfare  of  our  neighbors  from  the  effects  of  aircraft  operations  while  ensuring  the continued  viability  of  the  defense  flying  mission.    To  achieve  these  goals,  AICUZ  promotes development compatible with aircraft operations. 1.3.1.  The  AICUZ  study  must  be  consistent  with  current  land  use  planning  principles  and procedures  as  well  as  current  techniques  in  noise  assessment  methodology.    It  must  also describe  current  –  and  often  projected  –  air  operations,  provide  recommendations  for compatible  land  use  development,  and  support  local  long-range  land  use  planning  efforts adopted  in  accordance  with  nationally  recognized  standards.    The  AICUZ  should  relate  to state laws, enabling legislation, and local economic and political conditions.  The AICUZ is not  an  end  in  itself  but  rather  one  of  many  tools  used  by  planners  (on  base  and  off)  and decision  makers  to  make  reasonable  land  use  decisions.    The  AICUZ  study  must  have  a factual and rational basis.     AFH32-7084  2 NOVEMBER 2017 7 1.4.  Governing  Documents.  Several  documents  provide  the  regulatory  basis  for  the  AICUZ program: 1.4.1.  General  Services  Administration  (GSA)  Federal  Management  Circular  (FMC)  75-2, Compatible Land Uses at Federal Airfields, requires federal agencies that operate airfields to develop an “airfield land use plan” which shall contain an analysis of land use compatibility problems and potential solutions. Federal agencies must also work with local, regional, state, and other federal officials on compatible land use planning.  Finally, other federal  agencies having programs which affect or may affect the use of near federal airfields must ensure their programs  serve  and  foster  compatible  land  use  according  to  plans  (such  as  AICUZ) developed by the federal agency operating an airfield.  Agencies such as Housing and Urban Development  (HUD),  Veterans  Affairs  (VA),  Federal  Housing  Administration  (FHA)  and other federal agencies achieve this through their loan programs checking to see if homes they are financing are within the APZs or noise zones. 1.4.2.  AFI 32-7063, Air Installations Compatible Use Zones Program, sets forth the policy, responsibilities,  and  requirements  of  the  program.    Topics  covered  include  program objectives,  roles  and  responsibilities,  technical  criteria,  acquisition  of  real  estate  interests, land use compatibility guidelines, and applicability to overseas installations. 1.5.  Using the  AICUZ Program Manager’s Guide.  This handbook provides the technical and practical  information  the  AICUZ  program  manager  (PM)  needs  to  manage  the  installation’s AICUZ program.

AICUZ studies are prepared by the Air Force to assist local communities planning development near air installations through implementation of land use controls.  The study describes airfield operations and depicts zones  of  greatest  accident  potential  and  high  noise.    The  study  also  identifies  other  land  use-related concerns and contains recommendations for compatible development. 2.1.1.  The  recommendations  within  the  studies  are  non-binding  –  local  communities  have responsibility  for  land  use  development.    Since  Air  Force  recommendations  are  only advisory,  it  is  important  that  the  installation  take  an  active  role  with  the  community  in AICUZ program implementation (discussed in the Chapter 5). 2.1.2.  Details on the AICUZ study content, including a study template, may be found at the AFCEC/CP  Regional  Development  SharePoint®  site  under  the  AICUZ  Program  Toolbox Tab at https://portal.afcec.hedc.af.mil/CP/CPP/CPPR/SitePages/Home.aspx. 2.2.  Accident Potential  .  On 3 April 2006, a C-5B Galaxy crashed short of the runway, while attempting a heavyweight emergency landing at Dover Air Force Base, Delaware.  The aircraft took off from Dover AFB 21 minutes earlier and reported an in-flight emergency 10 minutes into the  flight.    All  17  people  aboard  survived  but  two  received  serious  injuries.    Upon  impact,  the aircraft  broke  apart  into  three  major  pieces  on  a  grassy  area  surrounding  the  base’s  fenced perimeter.  No one on the ground was injured because the land had been left undeveloped as part of the AICUZ program. 2.2.1.  While  the  chances  of  an  accident  are  remote,  mishaps  do  occur  and  proper  land  use planning can reduce risk to persons on the ground.  In the 1970s and 1980s, recognizing the need to identify areas of accident potential, the military conducted studies of historic accident and  operations  data  throughout  the  military.    An  analysis  of  aircraft  accidents  within  10 nautical miles of an airfield for the period of 1968-1972 led to defining areas of high accident potential  known  as  the  Clear  Zone,  Accident  Potential  Zone  I  (APZ  I),  and  Accident Potential Zone II (APZ II).  CZs and APZs are areas where accidents are most likely to occur if they occur – they are not predictors of accidents. 2.2.2.  Clear Zone.  The Clear Zone begins at the end of the runway and is the area of highest accident potential; it has few land uses that are compatible.  The Air Force concluded that the Clear  Zones  warranted  special  attention  due  to  the  high  incidence  of  accident  potential severely limiting acceptable land uses and, consequently, has spent tens of millions of dollars to acquire real property interests within the Clear Zone. 2.2.3.  Accident Potential Zones.  The percentages of accidents within the two APZs are such that, while purchase is not necessary, some type of land use control is essential.  APZ I lies beyond  the  Clear  Zone  and  is  of  lower  but  still  considerable  accident  potential.    APZ  II  is beyond  APZ  I  and  possesses  less  accident  potential  than  APZ  I  but  still  warrants  land  use restriction  recommendations.    The  Air  Force  recommends  limiting  the  number  of  people within APZs through focused land use planning. 2.2.4.  Figure  2.1  shows  Clear  Zones  and  APZ  dimensions  for  Class  “A”  and  Class  “B” runways.  See AFI 32-7063 for definitions and guidance on modifying these zones (including AFH32-7084  2 NOVEMBER 2017 9 their  application  to  rotary  wing  aircraft).    The  AFCEC/CP  Regional  Development at SharePoint® Toolbox https://portal.afcec.hedc.af.mil/CP/CPP/CPPR/aicuz/Forms/AllItems.aspx) has additional reference guidance on Clear Zones and APZs. tab also Program site: (under the AICUZ Figure 2.1.  Clear Zones and Accident Potential Zones for Fixed Wing Aircraft.  2.3.  Aircraft  Noise.  Although  there  are  a  number  of  noise  sources  on  an  air  installation, AICUZ  studies  generally  do  not  include  noise  from  military  or  civilian  vehicles,  generators  or Aerospace  Ground  Equipment  (AGE)  as  aircraft  noise  often  dominates  the  noise  environment.  Joint  Bases  are  likely  to  have  military  noise  sources  other  than  aircraft  that  may  need  to  be included  (i.e.,  small  arms  firing,  demolitions,  etc.)  in  their  AICUZ  study.    Discussions  of incorporating  ground  weapons  noise  into  an  AICUZ  study  are  included  in  this  chapter  and  in Section 3.5.2 of the AFI 32-7063. 2.3.1.  When  DoD  implemented  the  AICUZ  program  in  1973,  the  services  adopted  the NOISEMAP  computer  program  to  describe  noise  impacts  created  by  aircraft  operations.  NOISEMAP is one of two Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approved programs for measuring noise in the airfield environment.  The other is the Integrated Noise Model (INM) that was used until recently by the FAA for civil airports.  FAA has since incorporated INM into their new Aviation Environmental Design Tool (AEDT). . 2.3.2.  While some civil airports use live noise monitoring along with noise modeling, the Air Force uses only modeled contours.  Modeling allows for anticipated changes in aircraft and operational tempo.  This is important for beddown studies prepared under NEPA and allows bases  to  project  a  planning  contour  several  years  into  the  future,  which  will  provide communities with stability for their long term planning (see Section 2.5). 10 AFH32-7084  2 NOVEMBER 2017 2.3.3.  The next  significant  event  in  the development of  the military noise program  was the 1974 EPA designation of the noise descriptor “DNL”, or Day-Night  Average Sound  Level.  DNL does not reflect the actual sound level experienced at any point in time.  It refers to the average sound level exposure, measured in decibels (dB) on the A-weighted scale, over a 24-hour period, with a  10-dB penalty  for operations occurring during the hours of 10:00 p.m. to 7:00  a.m.    The  penalty  accounts  for  the  increased  annoyance  created  by  noise  events  that occur during this time.  In 1974, the Administrator of the EPA, under authority in the Noise Control  Act  of  1972,  recommended  all  federal  agencies  adopt  the  DNL  noise  descriptor system.  The Air Force and EPA agreed that all AICUZ studies would be prepared in DNL. 2.3.4.  The  development  of  DNL  was  an  important  milestone  in  the  AICUZ  program.    It provided  a  single  descriptor  for  the  noise  level  that  provides  noise  contours  for  land  use planning.    This  reduced  confusion,  increased  credibility,  and  allowed  for  comparative research efforts on the effects of noise. 2.3.5.  DNL  is  used  today  throughout  the  United  States,  with  the  exception  of  California which uses a similar metric called Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL).  CNEL adds an additional 5 dB weighting for aircraft operations during the evening hours of 7:00 p.m. to 10:00  p.m.    In  general,  CNEL  contours  average  a  little  larger  than  DNL  contours.    While State law may require the use of a different descriptor (such as CNEL in California), DNL is always  used  for  on-base  contours.    Noise  contours  for  the  off-base  aviation  noise environment  at  overseas  bases  are  prepared  only  in  consultation  with  the  overseas  Major Commands. 2.3.6.  Noise  is  represented  on  an  AICUZ  map  using  contours.    Just  as  a  topographic  map connects  points  of  equal  elevation  in  contours,  the  AICUZ  map  contour  connects  points  of equal noise value.  All AICUZ maps using DNL will display noise contours of 65, 70, 75, 80, and  85  dB  DNL  to  analyze  land  use  compatibility  in  the  AICUZ  study.    For  California installations, the maps should  display 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, and 85 dB CNEL contours.  State law  requires  airport  maps  in  California  to  display  a  60  dB  CNEL  noise  contour.    Outside California,  contours  less  than  65  dB  DNL  are  not  required  but  may  be  provided  if  local conditions  warrant  discussion  of  lower  noise  levels,  such  as  in  rural  and  desert  areas,  or where  significant  noise  complaints  have  been  received  from  areas  outside  the  65  dB  DNL contour.    AFCEC/CP  is  available  to  assist  installations  in  determining  whether  lower contours are warranted. 2.3.7.  DNL/CNEL noise contours reflecting the current mission operations are developed by using an installation’s aircraft operation and maintenance data and the latest DoD approved version  of  the  NOISEMAP  noise  model.    DoD  is  currently  developing  a  new  program,  the Advanced  Acoustic  Model  (AAM),  for  an  eventual  replacement  of  NOISEMAP.    Once approved for use, the Air Force will use AAM alone or in combination with NOISEMAP (as appropriate) to generate airfield noise contours. 2.3.8.  DNL/CNEL  noise  contours  are  based  on  Average  Annual  Day  (AAD)  of  airfield operations in accordance with AFI 32-7063.  This requirement is based on the fact that land use  compatibility  tables  were  created  using  AAD.    AFCEC/CP  archives  copies  of  noise model input and output files for all AICUZ studies. 2.3.9.  Military and civilian noise planning efforts have benefited from mutual interest.  One area is research and development.  Developing quieter engines for the KC-135, for example, AFH32-7084  2 NOVEMBER 2017 11 came about through commercial efforts to reduce fuel costs and noise impacts of the Boeing 707.    Other  efforts  have  gone  into  developing  hush  houses,  where  engines  can  run  at  full power  with  dramatically  reduced  noise  effects  to  the  surrounding  environment.    Noise abatement  procedures  can  be,  and  often  are,  integrated  into  flight  scheduling  and  aircraft operating  procedures.    Modifications  to  flight  tracks,  imposition  of  quiet  hours  and  use  of preferential  runways  are  all  techniques  used  by  both  the  military  and  civilian  airfields  to reduce  noise.    Most  installations  have  used  noise  reduction  techniques  to  their  maximum degree, and compatible land use planning and controls are the answer for further protection of the community. 2.4.  Ground Weapons Noise.  With the inception of Joint Bases within DoD, we now see more bases  where  both  aircraft  operations  and  ground  weapons  training  activities  (small  arms,  large caliber weapons or explosives) occur, adding another dimension to military noise that should be disclosed to the public.  For the most part, the different noise sources use separate delimiters and metrics and cannot be merged into a single set of master contours for all noise sources but should each  be  plotted  separately.    Many  bases  have  small  arms  ranges,  and/or  Explosive  Ordnance Disposal  (EOD)  proficiency  training  ranges.    Small  arms  ranges  may  employ  a  variety  of weapons  under  .50  caliber.    EOD  proficiency  ranges  may  include  areas  for  training  with  small amounts  of  explosives  (up  to  five  pounds  net  explosive  weight)  and  for  demolition  of  old munitions in an emergency.  Because range planners base the noise zones for these ranges on the loudest weapon (or the largest allowed munition charge) and not the number of annual operations conducted  at  the  range,  peak  contours  are  used  to  reflect  the  loudest  level  that  occurs  at  each receiver location. 2.4.1.  Since the sound of small arms is relatively localized when compared to other weapon systems,  noise  is  typically  only  a  concern  up  to  1000  meters  behind  the  firing  point.  However,  since  the  direction  of  fire  may  not  always  be  directly  away  from  the  boundary, installations  should  model  the  noise  when  the  range  footprint  is  within  3000  meters  of  the boundary.  NOTE: Ground ranges are defined using metric measures;  therefore, do not  use standard  United  States  measurement  systems  for  distances  associated  with  ground  training ranges. 2.4.2.  Noise from small arms ranges, demolition or EOD proficiency ranges may be included in  an  AICUZ  study  as  a  way  to  provide  information  to  local  communities  about  this  noise source.  Unless the training tempo has the possibility of increasing in the future, installations that  use  these  ranges  infrequently  should  consider  whether  asking  local  communities  to incorporate land use  controls for these noise sources is  warranted.      See  AFI  32-7063, Air Installations  Compatible  Use  Zones  Program,  section  3.5.2,  for  guidance  on  these  noise sources in AICUZ studies. 2.5.  Planning Contours.  Long-range planning by local land use authorities involves long-range strategies  to  influence  present  and  future  land  uses.    Frequent  AICUZ  updates  and  changes  to land use recommendations by the Air Force can undermine a community’s willingness to adopt AICUZ land use recommendations into their comprehensive plan or enact land use controls over the AICUZ footprint.  See Section 3.5.3 of AFI 32-7063 for planning contour guidance. 2.5.1.  A planning contour is a long range projection (usually 5-10 years) of the future flying mission at the installation.  Long range planning requires local land use authorities to project as far into the future as is practicable, changes that would influence the development for their community.  If the military only provides a noise contour reflecting present mission, it leaves 12 AFH32-7084  2 NOVEMBER 2017 the  community  in  a  quandary.    Should  they  adopt  land  use  controls  for  a  contour  that  may change  with  the  next  mission?    The  planning  contour  alleviates  uncertainty.    By  projecting possible  mission  changes  as  far  into  the  future  as  practicable,  the  Air  Force  can  help  add stability to the community planning process. 2.5.2.  Planning  contours  are  the  best  available,  realistic  long-range  projections  of unclassified estimates of future mission requirements.  They start with the low hanging fruit – are there any decisions on an aircraft beddown or realignment that have been made but the action has not  started, or it is only partially  completed?  Another consideration might  be to include  newly  proposed  beddowns  or  mission  change  actions,  or  the  retirement  of  legacy aircraft, that could affect the noise contours.  Planning contours must be based on reasonable conclusions  of  how  the  flying  mission  will  evolve,  and  cannot  be  based  on  classified information..  They are not commitments of future operations, nor should one portray it that way in the AICUZ study (e.g., the study should not state that a new aircraft will be based at that installation). Guidance for developing planning contours, and when not  to  use them, is included in Section 3.5.3 of AFI 32-7063. 2.5.2.1.  If  an  assumption  used  in  the  development  of  the  planning  contours  actually becomes  a  proposed  Air  Force  action,  the  proposal  and  reasonable  alternatives  will  be appropriately analyzed in compliance with the Air Force’s EIAP guidance.  Conversely, if the operations at  a base using planning contours in its AICUZ study change in a way that was not part of the assumptions, or the current operations at the base are otherwise modified, the AICUZ study may need updating. 2.5.2.2.  In situations where reasonable estimates of projected aircraft operations are not available, the local land use authorities are not open to long-range projections, or where little  or  no  change  to  aircraft  operations  is  expected  in  the  next  five  to  10  years,  the current  contours  may  be  used  to  represent  the  installation’s  noise  impact  instead  of  a separate planning contour. 2.6.  Hazards  to  Aircraft  Flight  Zone  (HAFZ).  Certain  land  uses  and  activities  can  pose potential hazards to flight.  The HAFZ is defined as the area within the Imaginary Surfaces that are described in the UFC 3-260-01, and in Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) Part 77, Objects Affecting Navigable Airspace, Subpart C, Obstruction Standards.  Examine land uses proposed in this area for compatibility. 2.6.1.  Height.  Tall objects can pose significant hazards to flight operations or interfere with navigational equipment  and radar systems.   This concern can be  further  complicated where there  are  major  changes  in  terrain  elevation  close  to  the  military  airfield.    Objects,  such  as building can block radar but also, along with transmission lines, cell towers, and even trees, can create a flight hazard by penetrating navigable airspace.  City/County agencies involved with  construction  permit  approvals  should  require  developers  to  submit  calculations,  which show that projects meet the height restriction criteria of FAA Part 77, for the specific airfield described in the AICUZ study. AFH32-7084  2 NOVEMBER 2017 13 Figure 2.2.  Imaginary Surfaces for Class B Runway. 2.6.2.  Visual  Interference.  Activities that  result in smoke, dust, or steam or may otherwise cause  interference  with  flight  activities  are  generally  not  compatible  with  air  operations.  Smoke  or  steam  generated  by  nearby  businesses,  industry,  or  field-burning  operations  can create severe visual interference during air operations.  Dust and smoke can be created by fire (controlled  burns,  agricultural  burning),  ground  disturbance  (agricultural  operations, grading),  industrial  activities,  or  similar  processes.    While  these  uses  may  be  initially incompatible,  mitigation  may  reduce  the  severity  of  the  impact.    For  instance,  watering before plowing will reduce dust.  14 AFH32-7084  2 NOVEMBER 2017 2.6.3.  Light  Emissions.    Bright  lights,  either  direct  or  reflected,  in  the  airfield  vicinity  can impair a pilot’s vision, especially at night.  A sudden flash from a bright light causes a spot or “halo”  to  remain  at  the  center  of  the  visual  field  for  a  few  seconds  or  more,  rendering  a person virtually blind to all other visual input.  This is particularly dangerous at night when the  flash  can  diminish  the  eye’s  adaptation  to  darkness.    The  eye  usually  achieves  partial recovery in minutes, but full adaptation typically requires 40 to 45 minutes.  Sources of direct or  indirect  (reflected)  light  emissions  are  a  land  use  compatibility  issue  when  Aircrew, maintainers,  air  traffic  controllers  or  airfield  operations  personnel  are  unable  to  obtain necessary  distance  of  view,  distinguish  airfield  surfaces,  markings  or  lighting,  cannot  see other  air  traffic  or  obstructions;  or  cannot  properly  train  due  to  artificial  light  sources affecting nighttime training activities.  Light sources can include spotlights, streetlights, laser light  shows,  fireworks,  buildings  with  reflective  glass  surfaces,  and  some  solar  energy technologies. 2.6.3.1.  Glint/Glare potential from Photovoltaic (PV) Panels.  The potential for glint and glare from PV panels is extremely rare.  However, depending on materials or the siting of the panels,  there may be the potential for  glint  and glare impacts  to  Air  Traffic Control (ATC) cabs and/or pilots on approach or departure to airfields.  To find out if glint/glare from  PV  arrays  in  relation  to  the  HAFZ  may  pose  a  problem,  the  Air  Force  uses  the Department  of  Energy’s  Sandia  National  Laboratory  Solar  Glare  Hazard  Analysis  Tool (SGHAT), in accordance with AFI 32-7063. 2.6.3.1.1.  Standards for Objection. 2.6.3.1.1.1.  Due  to  the  fixed  location  of  air  traffic  control  facilities,  prolonged exposure  to  glare  has  the  potential  to  affect  safety  of  operations;  therefore,  zero glare from PV panels is the compatibility standard at the ATC cab. 2.6.3.1.1.2.  The  standard  for  glint/glare  on  approach  or  during  other  tactical maneuvers  near  the  airfield  is  to  eliminate  any  potential  for  glint/glare  or  low potential  for  after-image  along  the  final  approach  path  or  landing  thresholds.  SGHAT can only evaluate straight in approaches using a three-degree glide path.  At  installations  where  military  aircraft  execute  tactical  approaches  or  overhead patterns, to include closed patterns, or have glide slopes other than three degrees, supplement  the  standard  SGHAT  analysis  to  ensure  there  are  no  operational impacts  from  proposed  PV  arrays.    Analysis  must  include  plotting  a  series  of observation  points  along  the  alternate  final  approach  paths  and  conduct  an SGAHT analysis for each point. 2.6.3.1.2.  Mitigating  circumstances  may  be  present  which  would  warrant  a determination  that,  notwithstanding  the  results  of  an  SGHAT  or  other  glint/glare analysis,  the  potential  mission  impact  associated  with  a  proposed  solar  PV  array  is within  an  acceptable  range.    See  AFI  32-7067  for  more  information  on  SGHAT.  Contact AFCEC/CP for assistance with the SGHAT analysis. 2.6.4.  Bird/Wildlife  Aircraft  Strike  Hazard  (BASH).    Assess  the  development  of  potential bird  attractants,  such  as  storm  water  management  ponds,  landfills,  waste  transfer  stations, wildlife refuges, and  agricultural  uses against BASH criteria.  The  AICUZ PM needs to  be familiar with the installation BASH plan.  The installation BASH program manager and the Natural  Resource  Manager  need  to  be  members  of  the  Installation  Encroachment AFH32-7084  2 NOVEMBER 2017 15 Management  Team.    See  the  Air  Force  Safety  Center  website  for  further  information  on BASH,  at  http://www.afsec.af.mil/aviationsafetydivision/bash/index.asp  and  on  the  Air Force https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af/USAF/ep/globalTab.do?channelPageId=s6925EC1334F60FB5E044080020E329A9. portal at 2.6.5.  Electromagnetic  Interference  (EMI).    New  generations  of  military  aircraft  and  their associated  weapons  systems  are  highly  dependent  on  complex  electronic  systems  for navigation and other critical flight and mission-related functions.  Consequently, use caution in  siting  any  activities  that  create  EMI.  EMI  can  be  induced  intentionally,  as  in  forms  of electronic warfare, or unintentionally, as a result of spurious emissions and responses, such as high-tension line leakage.  Impacts from EMI also include the masking of radar targets and interference in communications.  As the civil sector need for bandwidth increases, EMI will become  an  increasingly  important  concern.    It  is  important  the  installation  frequency manager be involved in the review of all projects that have the potential for EMI. 2.7.  Areas  of  Critical  Concern  Beyond  the  AICUZ  Footprint.  The  AFEM  program  has identified  areas  of  additional  land  use  compatibility  concerns  beyond  the  traditional  AICUZ footprint pursuant  to  the encroachment  challenge areas defined in  AFI 90-2001,  Encroachment Management.    AFI  32-7063  identifies  the  possibility  of  needing  to  define  Line  of  Sight/Look Angle  Zones  to  protect  the  viability  of  radar/radio  relay  sites,  telemetry  equipment,  radio antennas,  etc.    This  provision  also  leaves  open  the  ability  to  identify  other  areas  of  concern, especially  as  a  consultation  zone.    If  an  installation  feels  that,  they  have  a  unique  mission compatibility  issue  that  is  critical  enough  to  require  a  separate  compatibility  zone,  contact  the AFCEC  AICUZ  Program  Manager  who  will  elevate  the  issue  with  the  appropriate  MAJCOM EMT and the AF/A4CPI AICUZ Program Manager. 2.8.  Land  Use  Compatibility  Guidelines.  The  AICUZ  composite  footprint  for  an  air installation—the combination of noise contours, Clear Zones, APZs and the HAFZ—defines the minimum  acceptable  area  in  which  land  use  control  measures  are  recommended  to  protect  the public’s health, safety, and welfare and sustain the Air Force flying mission.  Local governments ultimately decide controls over land use and development in areas neighboring air installations; accordingly,  through  the  AICUZ  Program,  local  governments  are  encouraged  to  plan  for  and promote compatible development. 2.8.1.  In 1980, the Federal Interagency Committee on Noise (FICON) published Guidelines for Considering Noise in Land Use Planning and Control.  The purpose of these guidelines is to  encourage  the  best  land  use,  consistent  with  community  planning  objectives,  while minimizing exposure to  excessive noise levels.    These  guidelines have evolved for military airfields  through  the  DoDI  4165.57,  Air  Installations  Compatible  Use  Zones  (AICUZ),  and further  adjusted  through  the  individual  Services.    Air  Force  AICUZ  land  use  compatibility guidelines  for  Clear  Zones,  APZs,  and  aircraft  noise  zones  may  be  found  in  AFI  32-7063 (Attachments  2  and  3).    See  Tables  A3.2  and  A3.3  of  this  handbook  for  land  use compatibility  guidelines  for  noise  zones  from  small  arms,  large  caliber  munitions  and explosives.  AFI 32-7063, sections 3.8 through 3.13 provide additional guidance on land use compatibility. 2.8.2.  The  land  use  recommendations  in  these  tables  are  based  on  the  Federal  Highway Administration’s  Standard  Land  Use  Coding  Manual  (SLUCM).    The  SLUCM  standards, including  their  codes  and  sub-codes,  provide  planners  with  detailed  information  describing specific land use categories.  The Air Force has integrated additional land uses that did not 16 AFH32-7084  2 NOVEMBER 2017 exist when the original SLUCM categories were created into the land use compatibility tables in Attachments 2.  These additions reflect additional land uses and clarify the categorization of certain land uses for the purposes of the AICUZ study.  The Clear Zones, APZs and noise guidelines were developed specifically for airfield operations.  The SLUCM standards only group similar types of land use and do not  reflect  noise sensitivity or population  density in APZs that may influence whether a particular land use is compatible or incompatible. 2.8.3.  To  ensure  accurate  review  of  land  use  plans,  zoning  ordinances  or  development proposals,  it  is  critical  that  the  AICUZ  PM  is  aware  which  land  use  classification/coding system a local government uses:  SLUCM or the Land Based Classification System (LBCS).   Today,  many  communities  rely  on  the  LBCS,  so  the  AICUZ  PM  may  need  to  cross-walk local land use classifications with the two-digit SLUCM codes used in the AICUZ land use recommendation  tables  to  make  it  easier  to  identify  potentially  incompatible  land  uses.  Additionally,  AICUZ  PMs  should  be  familiar  with  the  more  detailed  three-  and  four-digit SLUCM breakout to get a better understanding of the full range of land use activities that fall under the broader two digit categories used in the AICUZ tables.  Copies of the SLUCM and LBCS,  including  a  cross-walk  of  the  two  coding  systems,  may  be  found  at  the  AFEM SharePoint® at https://portal.afcec.hedc.af.mil/CP/CPP/CPPR/SitePages/Home.aspx. Program Toolbox the AICUZ site under tab 2.9.  Interpreting Land Use Compatibility Guidelines.  The compatibility guidelines represent the  minimum  compatibility  recommendations  for  military  airfield  operations.    The  guidelines provide  a  direct  ‘Yes’  or  ‘No’  answer  to  whether  a  land  use  is  or  is  not  compatible.    Whether reviewing  the  compatibility  tables  in  AFI  32-7063  or  local  land  use  regulations,  check  the footnotes  to  see  if  there  are  any  conditions  or  exceptions  as  to  whether  a  land  use  is  or  is  not compatible.    Ancillary  uses  to  a  designated  compatible  land  use  may  not  necessarily  be compatible.  For instance, rapid rail is compatible within the APZs but aboveground rail stations, an ancillary use, are incompatible.  Cemeteries are also compatible, but cemetery chapels are not. 2.10.  Clear  Zone  Land  Use  Compatibility  .  The Clear Zone is the area that has the greatest risk of accidents after the runway itself based on analysis of historic aircraft accident locations near military airfields.  Because of this high risk, the Clear Zone warrants special attention.  The potential for accidents is so high that land use restrictions necessary to ensure compatibility can prohibit an otherwise reasonable economic use of the land.  Therefore, it is DoD and AF policy to own the land within the Clear Zone or control the land through restrictive use easements. 2.11.  Accident  Potential  Zone  Land  Use  Compatibility.  The  percentage  of  accidents  that have historically occurred within APZ’s I and II is such that the purchase of the property within the APZs by the Air Force is not necessary; however, some type of land use control is essential.  The  DoD  and  Air  Force  recommends  limiting  the  number  of  people  living  or  working  in  the APZs through proper land use planning.  The land use guidelines for APZs are founded on the concepts  of  population  density  and  building  size  near  airfields.    In  addition  to  limiting  density and  building  footprints,  the  DoD  considers  certain  types  of  land  use  (such  as  residential, educational  facilities,  and  medical  facilities)  incompatible  and  strongly  discourages  them  in APZs.    To  assist  local  governments  in  implementing  land  use  controls  in  APZs,  AFI  32-7063 provides  recommended  floor  area  ratios  (FARs)  for  select  commercial  uses.    The  following sections provide a general characterization of the recommended types of land use for each APZ. 2.11.1.  The  accident  potential  in  APZ  I  is  less  than  the  Clear  Zone  but  APZ  I  still  poses  a significant  risk  factor.    This  area  has  land  use  compatibility  guidelines  that  are  sufficiently AFH32-7084  2 NOVEMBER 2017 17 flexible  to  allow  reasonable  economic  use  of  the  land,  such  as  industrial/manufacturing, transportation,  communication/utilities,  wholesale  trade,  open  space,  recreation,  and agriculture.  However, uses that generate high concentrations of people in small areas are not appropriate. 2.11.2.  The  accident  potential  in  APZ  II  is  less  than  APZ  I  but  APZ  II  still  possesses  a significant potential for accidents. Within APZ II, acceptable uses include those compatible within APZ I, as well as low-density single family residential, personal and business services, and  commercial/retail  trade  uses  of  low  intensity  or  low  scale  of  operation.    High-density functions  such  as  multi-story  buildings,  places  of  assembly  (theaters,  churches,  schools, restaurants, etc.), and high-density office uses are not considered compatible. 2.11.3.  Floor Area Ratio (FAR) is used as a guide to density in some land use classifications within  the  APZs.    Many  communities  use  FAR  to  limit  the  intensity  or  scale  of  a  use, particularly non-residential uses with the potential to conflict with surrounding residential or less intense uses already in existence.  Early DoD policy recommended that density for non-residential land uses in APZ I be based on not more than 25 persons per acre and in APZ II not  more  than  50  persons  per  acre.    However,  land  development  can  occur  on  multiple properties  and  in  phases  over  time,  making  efforts  to  control  development  solely  based  on density hard to enforce.  Consequently, DoD conducted studies using required parking spaces to  determine appropriate FARs  to achieve the not  more than 25  and 50 persons per  acre in APZs I and II, respectively. 2.11.3.1.  Parking  requirements  can  be  based  on  number  of  employees,  building  floor area, type of use or other factors.  AFI 32-7063 ties FARs to standard parking generation rates  for  various  land  uses,  vehicle  occupancy  rates,  and  desired  people  intensity  in  the APZs  I  and  II.    For  APZ  I,  the  formula  is  FAR  =  25  people  an  acre/(Average  Vehicle Occupancy x Average Parking Rate x (43560/1000)).  The formula for APZ II is FAR = 50/  (Average Vehicle  Occupancy x Average Parking Rate x (43560/1000)), resulting in FARs ranging from .11 to.56, depending on the APZ and the land use. 2.11.3.2.  See  figure  2.3  for  an  example  of  how FARs  work.    For  determining  the  FAR for land use compatibility, the FAR equals the total floor area of a building in square feet divided by the total lot size in square feet.  For example, a two–story building has 5,000 square feet of floor on each level, totaling 10,000 square feet of floor.  The lot is 20,000 square feet.  Thus, If the building had only one story with 5,000 ft 2 and the lot was 20,000 ft 2, the FAR would be 0.25. 10,000 ft2  = 0.5 FAR 20,000 ft2 18 AFH32-7084  2 NOVEMBER 2017 Figure 2.3.  Calculating Floor Area Ratios (FARs).  2.12.  Land  Use  Compatibility  for  Aircraft  Nois  e.  Long-term  land  use  compatibility  with noise  resulting  from  the  operation  of  military  aircraft  should  minimize  the  effects  on  people, animals  (domestic  and  wild),  and  structures  on  or  in  proximity  to  the  installation.    Nearly  all studies on residential aircraft noise compatibility recommend no residential uses in noise zones above  75  dB  DNL.  Generally,  most  land  uses  exposed  to  noise  levels  below  65  dB  DNL  are considered compatible with airfield operations.  The area between 65-75 dB DNL noise contours may  not  qualify  for  Federal  mortgage  insurance  in  residential  categories  according  to  HUD Regulation 24 CFR Part 51, Environmental Criteria and Standards, Part B Noise Abatement and Control.    In  many  cases,  HUD  approval  requires  noise  attenuation  measures,  the  Regional Administrator’s  concurrence,  and  an  Environmental  Impact  Statement.    The  Department  of Veterans Affairs (VA) also has airfield noise and accident APZ restrictions that apply to its home loan guarantee program.  Whenever possible, residential land use should be located below 65 dB DNL.    Many  communities  near  military  air  installations  are  aware  of  Federal  Home  financing programs  that  have  limitations  or  guidelines  against  financing  loans  for  homes  in  high  noise areas and advise local citizens seeking to develop property. 2.12.1.  Although  AFI  32-7063  Table  A3.1  states  that  residential  land  uses  can  be  made compatible by adding adequate noise attenuation to reduce the interior noise level to 45 dB DNL  with  the  windows  closed,  the  exterior  noise  levels  cannot  be  reduced.    DoD  and  Air Force  guidelines  recommend  that  local  communities  determine  whether  their  need  for housing  cannot  otherwise  be  met  before  allowing  residential  development  in  high  noise zones. 2.12.2.  Noise  Level  Reduction  (NLR).    The  numbers  25,  30,  or  35  refer  to  noise  level reduction  (NLR)  levels.    NLR  (outdoor  to  indoor)  is  achieved  through  the  incorporation  of noise  attenuation  into  the  design  and  construction  of  a  structure.  Land  use  and  related structures  are  generally  compatible  in  certain  noise  zones  above  65  dB  DNL/CNEL; however, measures to achieve NLR of 25, 30, or 35 (depending on the noise zone) must be AFH32-7084  2 NOVEMBER 2017 19 incorporated into the design and construction of structures.  However, measures to achieve an overall  noise  reduction  do  not  necessarily  solve  noise  difficulties  outside  the  structure  and warrant  additional  evaluation.    Also,  check  the  footnotes  to  see  how  they  may  affect  NLR recommendations.    Guidelines  for  NLR  are  included  in  Guidelines  for  Sound  Insulation  of Residences  Exposed  to  Aircraft  Operations  (U.S.  Navy,  2005)  and  ARCP  Report  89—Guidelines  for  Airport  Sound  Insulation  (Transportation  Research  Board,  2013).    Both documents  are  available  on  the  AFCEC/CP  Regional  Development  SharePoint®  site  at https://portal.afcec.hedc.af.mil/CP/CPP/CPPR/SitePages/Home.aspx  under  the  AICUZ Program Toolbox tab. 2.12.3.  Most  industrial/manufacturing  land  uses  are  compatible  in  the  airfield  environs.  Exceptions  are  uses  such  as  research  or  scientific  activities  that  require  lower  noise  levels and/or  uses  sensitive  to  vibration.    The  Air  Force  recommends  the  addition  of  noise attenuation measures to those areas of buildings devoted to office  use, receiving the public, or those areas where the normal background noise level is low. 2.12.4.  The  transportation,  communications  and  utilities  categories  have  a  high  noise  level compatibility  because  they  generally  are  not  people-intensive  and  the  presence  of  people associated with these land use categories is usually of short duration.  Additional evaluation is warranted, however, when buildings are required for these uses. 2.12.5.  The  commercial/retail  trade  and  personal  and  business  services  categories  are compatible without restriction  up to  70 dB DNL; however, they are  generally incompatible above  80  dB  DNL.  Between  70-80  dB  DNL,  noise  level  reduction  measures  should  be included in the design and construction of buildings. 2.12.6.  The nature of most  uses in  the public  and quasi-public services category  requires a quieter environment, and attempts should be made to locate these uses below 65 dB DNL or else to provide adequate noise level reduction. 2.12.7.  Although  recreational  use  has  often  been  recommended  as  compatible  with  high noise  levels,  in  areas  above  75  dB  DNL,  noise  becomes  a  factor  that  limits  the  ability  to enjoy  such  uses.    Where  the  requirement  to  hear  is  a  function  of  the  use  (i.e.,  music  shell, etc.), compatibility is limited.  Buildings associated with golf courses and similar uses should be  noise  attenuated.    People  who  are  outdoors  in  areas  above  80  dB  DNL  should  consider wearing hearing protection when aircraft noise is present. 2.12.8.  With  the  exception  of  livestock  farming,  most  uses  in  the  resource  production  and extraction land use category are compatible with some restrictions. However, land uses that require  residences  or  offices  may  require  noise  level  reduction  for  compatibility.    If  these land  uses  or  activities  require  people  be  outdoors  in  in  the  80  dB  DNL  and  higher  noise zones, hearing protection should be worn when noise sources are present. 2.13.  Energy Related Land Uses.  Because of the changing needs of military test and training, the  broad  array  of  energy  related  land  uses,  and  the  continual  emergence  of  new  energy technologies, there are no pre-defined or generic “energy development zones” for airfields nor is there  a  definitive  yes/no  answer  when  it  comes  to  energy  compatibility.    Typically,  land  use plans and zoning maps do not identify energy-related land, so AICUZ PMs and others involved in  encroachment  management  need  to  be  actively  watching  for  these  kinds  of  development proposals. 20 AFH32-7084  2 NOVEMBER 2017 2.13.1.  Land uses related to energy development, including support infrastructure, fall under a range of SLUCM codes.  See AICUZ AFI 32-7063, Section 3.12 for more details. 2.13.2.  Typically,  utility  related  land  uses  may  not  be  identified  on  a  local  land  use  map; AICUZ PMs may learn about local incentives to attract renewable energy development to the area  or  local  or  state  permits  for  energy  development.    Like  any  other  type  of  land development  proposal,  evaluate  proposed  energy  projects  for  mission  compatibility  issues. There are no specific land use compatibility criteria for energy related land uses outside the APZs;  however,  energy  projects  proposed  within  the  HAFZ  can  be  evaluated  using  the potential effects identified in sections 2.6 and 2.8 of this handbook as a starting point. 2.13.3.  The following three factors must be considered when evaluating the compatibility or potential for mission impacts of proposed energy development or transmission line projects:  The  technology  (solar,  wind,  geo-thermal,  and  biomass),  the  location  of  the  proposed development  and  the  mission  requirements.  Consider  the  following  mission  compatibility concerns  for  various  types  of  energy  projects  when  evaluating  the  compatibility  of  a proposed development: 2.13.3.1.  Wind  turbine  projects  will  be  evaluated  for  possible  radar  interference  to airfield  and  weather  radar,  long-range  radar,  aircraft-borne  radar,  and  for  hazards  to flight; 2.13.3.2.  Geothermal projects should be evaluated to determine whether the height of the steam  towers  would  create  hazards  to  flight,  and  if  the  steam  could  create  visual interference.  Depending on the type of geothermal technology and location of the plant, evaluate the potential for ice fog; 2.13.3.3.  Solar  energy  technologies  such  as  photo  voltaic  (PV)  panel  arrays  or concentrating  solar  power,  which  use  reflective  materials  like  mirrors  and  lenses  to concentrate sunlight to generate thermal energy, need to be evaluated for glint and glare issues  for  pilots  and/or  the  air  traffic  control  tower.    Some  solar  facilities  have  the potential  to  create  thermal  updrafts  and  this  possibility  should  be  evaluated.    However, such updrafts will typically dissipate at distances beyond 50 feet, so standard separation distances between aircraft and objects on the ground may mitigate this concern; 2.13.3.4.  Evaluate biomass power generating plant designs and locations to determine if the  emissions  stacks  will  create  an  obstruction.    Assess  whether  or  not  the  emissions (dust/smoke/steam)  will  obscure  pilot  or  ATC  vision;  and  whether  the  design  of  the biomass  feedstock  storage  area  could  attract  birds,  wildlife  or  their  prey  and  therefore contribute to increased potential for BASH; 2.13.3.5.  All  electricity  producing  energy  projects  (conventional  as  well  as  clean)  also include transmission lines.  `The project evaluation should also evaluate the compatibility of any new above ground transmission lines that would be required to connect the source to  the  electrical  grid.  AFI  32-7063,  Table  A2.1  includes  compatibility  criteria  for transmission lines in the APZs; 2.13.3.6.  Installations can engage with energy developers if they find out about proposed energy  development  projects  that  may  have  the  potential  to  impact  their  mission; however,  there  are  limits  to  what  installation  personnel  can  tell  the  developer.    Should installation  personnel  find  out  about  a  proposed  energy  development  prior  to  it  coming through  the  OSD  Clearinghouse  process,  it  is  highly  recommended  that  the  issue  be AFH32-7084  2 NOVEMBER 2017 21 elevated  to  the  MAJCOM  EMT  lead  for  further  guidance.    The  DoD  Siting Clearinghouse  of  the  Office  of  the  Deputy  Undersecretary  of  Defense,  Installations  and Environment,  coordinates  the  DoD  assessment  of  all  renewable  energy  projects  to prevent or mitigate adverse impacts on military operations, in accordance with 32 CFR, Part 211.  See AFI 13-201, Attachment 15, for additional information. 2.14.  Conclusion.  The  overall  goal  of  the  Air  Force  AICUZ  program  is  to  protect  the  health, safety, and welfare of our neighbors while preserving our defense missions.  We seek to achieve these goals by promoting compatible development.  Chapter 3 discusses preparing the AICUZ Study. 22 AFH32-7084  2 NOVEMBER 2017 CHAPTER 3 PREPARING AN AICUZ STUDY 3.1.  Introduction.  This  chapter  discusses  in  detail  the  five  phases  for  preparing  an  AICUZ study, shown in Table 3.1.  The preparation of AICUZ amendments is not applicable until Phases IV and V. Table 3.1.   5 Phases for Preparing an AICUZ Study. Phase I Data Collection Phase II Operational Data Review and Validation Phase III Development of Noise Contour Map Phase IV Preparing an AICUZ Study Phase V Public Release of the AICUZ Study or Amendment 3.1.1.  Implementation of the AICUZ program is ongoing process.  Nearly all air installations have  completed  and  released  AICUZ  studies,  although  some  installations  may  be  exempt (see  Section  4.2).    Installation  Commanders  are  responsible  for  ensuring  that  each  air installation has an active AICUZ program.   The Base Civil  Engineer normally  appoints the AICUZ  PM,  although  the  program  may  fall  under  another  organization.    Duties  of  the AICUZ  PM  include  preparing  and  releasing  updated  AICUZ  studies,  data  validation  and program implementation (these duties are discussed in detail in Section 6). including Installation/Wing 3.1.2.  An accurate AICUZ study requires the full support and participation of all installation functions leadership,  Civil  Engineering,  AICUZ  PM, Bioenvironmental  Engineering,  Legal,  Public  Affairs  (PA),  Base  Operations,  the  flying wings, Air Traffic Control, Aircraft Maintenance, Safety, Weather, Comptroller, tenant units, and other appropriate functional areas.  Support and participation by each functional area are particularly  important  during  the  data  collection  and  analysis  phase  but  should  occur throughout  the  entire  AICUZ  process.    See  chapter  2  of  AFI  32-7063  for  more  details  on these shared roles and shared responsibilities. 3.2.  Phase I:  Data Collection.  A successful AICUZ program is built on accurate information.  There  are  two  types  of  data  gathered  at  this  stage:    Operational  data  and  local  land  use information.    The  operational  data  comes  from  aircraft  flying  and  maintenance  units.    The collection  team  will  also  interview  units  that  conduct  ground  testing  and  training  activities,  if applicable.    The  team  will  then  focus  outside  the  fence  for  information  on  existing  and  future local land use and development data, such as comprehensive plans, zoning regulations, economic development  goals,  population  changes,  master  plans  and  planned  developments,  capital improvement projects, etc. 3.2.1.  In most instances, the data gathering and preparation of the AICUZ will be performed by an Architect/Engineer (A/E) firm under contract to the Air Force – this section will cover responsibilities of the base, MAJCOM AFCEC, and the contractor and the preparation steps required  when  the  data  collection  is  contracted  out.    All  contact  with  the  A/E  should  be through  the  Contracting  Officer  Representative  (COR)  unless  otherwise  specified  by  the COR.  If the AICUZ study is contracted through AFCEC, AFCEC/CP will appoint the COR.  AFH32-7084  2 NOVEMBER 2017 23 When  contracted  through  the  HQ  AFRC  or  HQ  ANG,  the  COR  will  be  appointed  by  the appropriate organization.  In all cases, AFCEC/CP will provide technical and review support.  Note:  AFCEC/CP may choose to develop the AICUZ noise contours in-house in some cases rather than use an A/E firm. 3.2.2.  A  post-award  telephonic  pre-kick-off  meeting  with  the  A/E  contractors,  installation representatives,  MAJCOM  representatives,  and  AFCEC/CP  personnel  should  immediately follow  acquisition’s  Notice  to  Proceed.    This  meeting  allows  all  the  players  to  review  the project statement of work and ensure mutual understanding of the work, the schedule, and the deliverables. 3.2.2.1.  It  also  serves  as  an  opportunity  to  introduce  the  Government  and  contractor personnel associated with the project; discuss the contractor’s plan for accomplishing the work; identify any special requirements for interviews, documents or other information; and, identify all Government furnished materials needed  to perform the work, including previous AICUZ, ICEMAP and JLUS studies, if applicable. 3.2.2.2.  Among  the  Government-provided  material  is  the  Operational  Data  Gathering Handbook that describes the information required during the data gathering phase.  The Handbook  will  help  the  installation’s  Point  of  Contact  (POC)  to  determine  the  staff required during data gathering and allow the POC to start filling in the basic information.  The  AICUZ  Data  Collection  Handbook  is  available  at  the  AFCEC/CP  Regional Development at https://portal.afcec.hedc.af.mil/CP/CPP/CPPR/SitePages/Home.aspx. the  AICUZ SharePoint® Toolbox tab site under 3.2.3.  The AICUZ PM normally serves as the installation’s POC for the contracted AICUZ study effort.  They should be familiar with the AICUZ Study Update task order and prepare for the A/E data-gathering visit by coordinating the effort through the IEMT to ensure all key players attend the on-base project kickoff. 3.2.4.  The data gathering week begins with an on-site kickoff meeting.  To ensure situational awareness  and  secure  project  support,  brief  both  the  Installation/Wing  leadership  and  the IEMT prior to the AICUZ kickoff. 3.2.5.  The  kickoff  meeting  will  include  the  following  representatives  from  the  installation:  Base and/or wing leadership; flying and maintenance units; legal; public affairs; the AICUZ PM;  and members of the  IEMT.  Also attending will be the COR; representatives from  the MAJCOM  (if  applicable);  representatives  from  AFCEC/CP;  and  contractors  from  the  A/E firm.  This meeting is restricted to Air Force personnel and their contractors.  While the data collection team will later meet with off-base stakeholders to gather community land use data, these stakeholders do not have a role in defining the noise contours.  The meeting starts with a project overview, including COR, A/E, and installation responsibilities, the week’s agenda, and project milestones.  Data gathering interviews are set up with installation personnel and the A/E firm while the AICUZ PM works with the local communities to set up the off-base interviews necessary for the land use portion of the AICUZ study. 3.2.6.  Most data gathering interviews take less than an hour.  Use these interviews to build on  the  data  gathered  after  the  initial  telephonic  pre-kickoff  meeting.    Limit  the  number  of operators/support  personnel  in  each  interview  session.    This  encourages  individual participation and perspective, discouraging “group think” and information by consensus.  If 24 AFH32-7084  2 NOVEMBER 2017 you have several operators in the same interview period, having someone in their leadership chain present will help ensure all interviewees participate. 3.2.7.  All  affected  land  use  planning  authorities  should  be  included  in  the  data  review including  local  communities,  counties,  regional  planning  organizations,  and  councils  of government (COG).  If the community has already established a JLUS, be sure to interview someone  of  authority  from  the  JLUS  committee.    For  the  meetings  with  off-base stakeholders, always have a representative from the base present (usually the AICUZ PM and possibly a public affairs specialist).  Information gathered during this phase includes current and  future  land  use  plans,  zoning  information,  community  populations,  and  necessary  GIS layers.  Interviews also include discussions of any airport or military overlays, if applicable. 3.2.8.  To  keep  the  project  on  schedule  it  is  important  that  wing  and  base  leadership  stay involved  in  the  process.    Normally,  the  data  collection  team,  through  the  AICUZ  PM, schedules an out brief with wing/base leadership for the end of the week.  At that time, with concurrence  from  leadership,  the  data  collection  team  establishes  deadlines  for  any outstanding data gaps. 3.3.  Phase  II:    Data  Review  and  Validation.  The  AICUZ  program,  like  any  successful activity, is dependent on the quality, accuracy, and completeness of its data inputs.  The AICUZ program  requires  a  comprehensive  review  and  validation  process  because  recommendations based on the data may eventually be incorporated into local land use regulations or ordinances.  There  is  also  the  possibility  the  data  could  be  challenged  in  litigation.    Phase  II  provides  the quality assurance the AICUZ program requires. 3.3.1.  During  Phase  II,  the  contractor  and  base,  along  with  the  MAJCOM  and  AFCEC/CP personnel, review the Phase I data package for adequacy.  Data packages will vary from base to base.  A comprehensive review helps to identify and correct deficiencies before the public release.    Some  portions  of  the  program  require  the  AICUZ  PM  to  exercise  a  significant degree of judgment, particularly when it comes to analyzing land use compatibility.  This is especially  true  where  installations  experience  extreme  development  pressure  or  where multiple jurisdictions control land use.  There is no “one size fits all” approach to assessing or  evaluating  data.    Local  conditions  vary  from  one  place  to  another,  generating  unique circumstances  for  each  installation  and  its  surrounding  community.    In  addition  to determining the content and quality of Phase I data, Phase II offers the opportunity to identify instances where assistance is required to close data gaps.  Errors or omissions in Phase I can easily compromise subsequent phases. 3.3.2.  There are five basic steps in Phase II: 3.3.2.1.  Determine  if  all  elements  of  Phase  I  have  been  completed.    After  the  data gathering  trip,  the  COR  should  set  up  a  meeting  (online,  conference  call  or  in  person) between  the  COR,  A/E,  AICUZ  PM,  MAJCOM,  and  AFCEC/CP  to  identify  any  data gaps  where  information  is  still  pending  and  then  proceed  through  the  AICUZ  PM  to contact those units’ individuals responsible for the missing data. 3.3.2.2.  Ensure  flight  and  maintenance  data  and  the  non-aviation  operational  elements are accurate. 3.3.2.3.  Review  the  non-operational  land  use  elements  in  detail.    Check  the  data  for accuracy.  When required, the COR will request further information from the appropriate internal and external stakeholders. AFH32-7084  2 NOVEMBER 2017 25 3.3.2.4.  Correct the errors and augment insufficient data with the information obtained. 3.3.2.5.  Finally, review results of the corrected data package to ensure they are accurate and return the data package to the A/E to begin analysis. 3.3.3.  Once it has been determined that all the elements of Phase I have been completed and data gaps closed, the contractor will turn to the internal and external stakeholders to validate the data.  The Noise Model Operational Data Documentation (NMODD) captures all of this information (see section 3.5.1, below).  For the operational data, ask flight and maintenance personnel  and  personnel  from  appropriate  non-flying  missions  (such  as  ground  weapons ranges) if the data sheets properly captured the information.  Wherever possible, ensure that the same personnel who provided the information for the data sheets review them. 3.3.4.  To validate the land use data gathered from local governments, the applicable portions of the data package should be brought to the appropriate land use authorities by the AICUZ PM.    Off-base  stakeholders  should  review  only  those  parts  of  the  package  to  which  they contributed.  Remember, all conclusions and noise contours remain draft and are official use only until the updated AICUZ study is approved. 3.4.  Phase III:  Preparation of the Noise Contour Map.  Preparation of the noise contour map is the “long pole in the tent” when preparing an AICUZ study update.  Until the contour map is complete, land use analysis cannot begin. 3.4.1.  The  noise  contour  maps  are  developed  either  by  an  A/E  contractor  or  AFCEC/CP AICUZ  staff  and  initially  focus  on  current  operations.    A  technical  review  of  the  noise contours is carried out by the COR, base, MAJCOM, and AFCEC/CP AICUZ staff.  If any concerns  are  identified,  the  COR  will  set  up  a  meeting  of  the  stakeholders  to  resolve  the concern. 3.4.2.  Once  the  current  mission  noise  contour  is  defined,  the  A/E  will  prepare  a  planning contour based on assumptions provided by the base that have concurrence from AFCEC/CP AICUZ staff.  See section 2.5 of this handbook and section 3.5.3 of AFI  32-7063 for more information and guidance on planning contours. 3.5.  Phase IV:   Preparation of AICUZ Study.  At this stage, all the collected data have been reviewed;  noise  contours  and  the  Noise  Model  Operational  Data  Documentation  (NMODD) prepared  and  validated;  and,  the  A/E  has  been  given  approval  for  preparation  of  the  AICUZ study and its associated products. 3.5.1.  The AICUZ study contract deliverable consists of the following:  The AICUZ study, the NMODD, the AICUZ map brochure, the AICUZ public brochure, and the AICUZ poster station deliverables. 3.5.1.1.  The  audience  for  the  AICUZ  study  consists  of  the  public,  land  planning agencies, and elected officials.  The AICUZ study gives an overview of the AICUZ at a particular installation to include noise contours, APZs, HAFZ, off-base land use analysis, and  recommendations  for  achieving  compatible  development.    Additionally,  the  study will  give  an  overview  of  the  base  history,  mission,  and  economic  impact.    The  study should  be  written  for  a  layperson  with  little  knowledge  of  the  base  mission  or  AICUZ.  An  AICUZ  study  template  is  available  at  the  AFCEC/CP  Regional  Development SharePoint® at https://portal.afcec.hedc.af.mil/CP/CPP/CPPR/SitePages/Home.aspx. Program Toolbox AICUZ site under the tab 26 AFH32-7084  2 NOVEMBER 2017 3.5.1.2.  The NMODD is a compilation of the aircraft operational data used for the noise modeling. It contains points of contacts for the providers of information, all assumptions, spreadsheets  used  to  calculate  daily  operations,  aircraft  configurations  (i.e.,  flight profiles) for aircraft operations in  the airfield and SUA/ASU, as well as  information  on engine  runs  and  munitions  usage  for  ranges.  For  models  using  BASEOPS,  this information  can  be  generated  from  the  report  module.    See  AFI  32-7070  for  more information on the NMODD. 3.5.1.3.  The  AICUZ  map  brochure  is  the  size  of  a  foldable  highway  travel  map  and briefly covers the topics in the AICUZ study.  It provides a detailed street map of the base environs  and  shows  the  composite  AICUZ  map  (noise  zones,  APZs  and  HAFZ).    The map  often  serves  as  a  tool  for  real  estate  professionals  to  discuss  AICUZ  with  their buyers and sellers. 3.5.1.4.  The AICUZ public brochure covers the topics of the AICUZ map brochure in a condensed  version  with  a  small  scale  composite  AICUZ  map.    Normally  the  size  of  a sheet of legal-sized paper, it is tri-folded to create six columns for text and maps and to fit in a #10 envelope.  The AICUZ public brochure is of a size easily mailed or distributed at meetings. 3.5.1.5.  The AICUZ poster station deliverables usually consist of five large posters that can be displayed on easels for AICUZ public release: 3.5.1.5.1.  Poster 1 addresses the Base mission, history and economic impact; 3.5.1.5.2.  Poster  2  discusses  flight  operations  at  the  installation,  to  include  flight track overlays and based aircraft flight frequency; 3.5.1.5.3.  Poster  3  will be  an  overview  of  the  noise  safety  zones,  APZs,  height  and obstruction criteria, and compatible land use recommendations; 3.5.1.5.4.  Poster 4 is a map of the previous approved AICUZ noise contour overlaid with  the  new  AICUZ  noise  contour  on  a  community  map  showing  existing  zoning.  The noise contours will show gradational shading down to 50 dB DNL/CNEL; and 3.5.1.5.5.  Poster  5  will  address  the  roles  and  responsibilities  for  Air  Force,  local governments, real estate professionals, developers, and public involvement. 3.5.1.6.  If there are additional topics that should be discussed (such as ground weapons noise, weapons danger zones or an auxiliary field), a sixth poster station may be added.  For meetings where aircraft noise may prove of high interest, a second poster 4 should be prepared and displayed. 3.5.1.7.  These laminated posters shall be mounted on foam board and any maps shall be presented at a large enough scale for the public to locate their property in reference to the noise contours, APZs and flight paths. 3.5.2.  The COR for the  AICUZ task order will normally schedule two reviews of the draft AICUZ  (at  50%  and  90%).  The  NMODD  will  be  used  during  air  operations  validation.  Normally,  the  implementation  tools  (AICUZ  map  brochure,  public  brochure,  and  poster station deliverables) undergo their 50% review later as they must be based on the reconciled AICUZ 50% review.  The 90% review addresses all AICUZ products. AFH32-7084  2 NOVEMBER 2017 27 3.5.3.  The  reviews  will  be  accomplished  by  the  COR,  base,  MAJCOM,  and  AFCEC/CP staff.  After each review, staff comments will be reconciled with the A/E. 3.5.4.  AICUZ  Study  Amendments.    Up  to  this  point,  the  preparation  process  has  applied only to situations that require significant revisions to AICUZ studies.  When the changes are few  and  minor  in  nature,  the  change  requires  little  explanation,  or  if  no  controversy  exists, amendments to AICUZ studies may be prepared. 3.5.4.1.  Amendment  typically  consists  of  corrected  pages,  labeling  of  maps,  etc.    The approval process for AICUZ amendments begins with preparation of the draft submittal package.  The package consists of any corrected pages and draft of the transmittal letter to the local communities. 3.5.4.2.  If  the  installation  AICUZ  PM  thinks  they  have  a  need  to  amend  the  AICUZ study, they should contact AFCEC/CP to discuss whether an AICUZ amendment would be  advisable.    If  the  consensus  is  to  move  forward,  the  AICUZ  PM  will  work  with AFCEC/CP to prepare the draft submittal package for IEMT coordination.  If the IEMT concurs,  they  will  forward  the  draft  package  to  the  MAJCOM  EMT  for  their coordination.  Any changes to the package will be coordinated with the AFCEC AICUZ PM.  If there are no changes, the installation AICUZ PM will have the commander sign the transmittal letter and number.  The installation will ensure that AFCEC/CP receives a copy of the final amendment package for its files. 3.6.  Phase  V:    Public  Release  of  an  AICUZ  Study  or  Amendment.  Phase  V  places  the AICUZ  program  into  the  public  forum.    During  this  phase,  a  coordinated  team  effort  is imperative to ensure that the public, local governments and agencies who may be affected by the AICUZ are brought into the release process.  At the same time, the release of an updated AICUZ study  or  amendment  gives  the  air  installation  a  chance  to  “kick  start”  the  AICUZ  program through the momentum provided by the public release.  Increased community awareness opens opportunities to pursue new land use strategies that will benefit both the community and the air installation. 3.6.1.  Public  Release  of  the  AICUZ  Study  Amendment.    The  public  release  of  an amendment  is  primarily  accomplished  through  public  notification  through  newspapers  and other media and through the distribution of the amendment in the same way an AICUZ study update is released (see section 3.6.5).  Although public meetings on the amendment are not required,  the  base/wing  leadership  should  consider  such  a  meeting  if  they  feel  there  is significant  public  interest.    AFCEC/CP  can  provide  assistance  with  organizing  a  public meeting. 3.6.2.  Public Release of the AICUZ Study Update.  The public release of an update includes public  notification,  distribution  of  the  study  and  culminating  in  the  Installation/Wing leadership releasing the AICUZ study in public release meeting.  The members of the IEMT will  assist  Installation/Wing  leadership  in  all  phases  of  the  public  release,  with  the  AICUZ PM, Public Affairs and Legal playing major roles. 3.6.3.  Waiving  the  public  release  meeting.    For  unique  cases,  the  MAJCOM  EMT,  on  the recommendation of AFCEC/CP, may consider waiving the public meeting requirement.  To receive a waiver, the installation commander must prepare and submit a waiver request along with full explanation and justification to MAJCOM EMT.  If the EMT approves the waiver, the notification of the release of the update is still published in papers and other appropriate 28 AFH32-7084  2 NOVEMBER 2017 media.  The installation should simultaneously distribute copies of the study to all the same parties  that  normally  would  have  received  copies  (Section  3.6.4)  who  would  have  been invited  to  the  public  meeting  or  who  received  a  previous  study,  or  would  have  received copies.    Since  AICUZ  amendments  do  not  require  a  public  release  meeting,  a  waiver  is unnecessary. 3.6.4.  Preparing for an AICUZ public release.  The public release includes both distribution of  the  update  or  amendment  as  well  as  the  public  meeting.    It  is  critical  to  coordinate  all elements of the public release effort to meet a series of tight deadlines.  Once the installation receives  A/E  AICUZ  update  deliverables,  a  firm  release  date  can  be  scheduled  and arrangements can be made for the venue for the AICUZ public meeting. 3.6.4.1.  The  first  task  is  preparation  of  the  AICUZ  release  notice  for  publication  in  the local newspapers and the media plan.  Both should be coordinated through the IEMT, if applicable,  noting  all  the  deadlines  that  must  be  met  for  a  successful  AICUZ  public release.    Public  notification  about  the  AICUZ  release  should  start  14  days  prior  to  the public  release  meeting.    Make  use  of  broadcast,  print  and  social  media  to  get  out  the message. 3.6.4.2.  External Distribution.  The installation should simultaneously send copies of the AICUZ  study  or  amendment  to  the  applicable  agencies,  local  governments,  key organizations, State single points of contact and interested parties listed in Table 3.2, and Table  6.1  as  well  as  to  local  libraries  and  individuals  known  to  have  an  interest.  AFCEC/CP  will  ensure  copies  of  the  AICUZ  are  sent  to  the  appropriate  regional  HUD and VA offices for use in federally guaranteed loan programs.  The general public may be provided with copies (hard or electronic) upon request. 3.6.4.2.1.  HQ USAF/LLP distributes the update or amendment to the Congressional delegation  in  Washington,  DC.    The  COR  (i.e.,  AFCEC/CP,  NGB,  AFRC,  etc.) provides  copies  of  the  AICUZ  study  and  citizen’s  brochure/map,  or  amendment  to HQ USAF/A4CIP at least 15 days prior to the public release of an updated study or the public notification of an amendment. 3.6.4.3.  Internal Distribution. In addition to the public release activities, the AICUZ PM should  distribute  copies  of  the  AICUZ  study  or  amendment  to  Public  Affairs,  Legal Office,  and  Civil  Engineering.    Provide  an  enlarged  copy  of  the  AICUZ  map  to  the Housing Management Office and base library for display in a conspicuous area to ensure Air Force personnel seeking off-base housing are aware of the noise or accident potential impacting adjacent land areas.   AFH32-7084  2 NOVEMBER 2017 29 3.6.5.  Public  Release  Meeting.    Typically,  the  public  release  meeting  is  held  off  base  to encourage maximum participation and avoid the perception of undue influence by the base.  Carefully consider the location for the public release.  A good or bad venue could set the tone for the entire meeting. 3.6.5.1.  Timing.  The timing of the meeting is important.  Normally, the meetings run 3-4  hours,  starting  in  late afternoon  and  going  into  early  evening,  to  allow participants  to attend after work.  Tuesday and Thursday normally work best, with Thursdays preferred.  Avoid Mondays, Fridays, holidays and holiday-shortened weeks as people tend to make other plans.  Check to make sure there are no conflicting community meetings (i.e., City Council, Planning Commission, etc.) scheduled for the time of the release. 3.6.5.2.  Audience.  Make a list  of agencies, organizations, elected officials,  community leaders,  local  planners,  and  other  key  individuals  who  should  be  invited  to  the  release meeting  (see  Table  3.2).    Consultation  with  the  MAJCOM  and  AFCEC/CP,  and networking  with  other  nearby  air  installations  can  help  you  identify  stakeholders, anticipate questions, and develop your message.

Format.  The AICUZ public meeting is an information session normally held in an  “Open  House”  format.    Traditionally,  government  agencies  have  used  “Town  Hall” meetings to provide information to the public but it may also be perceived as “us against them” and may become adversarial.  Town hall meetings limit the amount of information presented and public participation and interaction.  The open house meeting is less formal and  has  no  set  presentations.    Instead,  it  allows  the  public  to  interact  one-on-one  with various  subject  matter  experts  at  poster  stations  and  allows  the  public  to  access information  at  their  own  pace  (see  figure  3.1  for  the  layout  of  a  typical  open  house meeting layout). Figure 3.1.  Open House Format Meeting.  3.6.6.  Remember the following key points when it comes to the AICUZ open house: 3.6.6.1.  Take  advantage  of  the  meeting  to  help  stakeholders  better  understand  the defense  mission.    Remember,  the  AICUZ  release  open  house  is  both  educational  and informational. 3.6.6.2.  When discussing the base mission, always include its place in the economy, i.e., number of employees, total economic impact, etc.; 3.6.6.3.  In a situation of low trust and high concern by the public, keep messages simple and  straight  forward.    Make  no  more  than  three  main  points,  each  backed  up  by  three facts; and, 3.6.6.4.  Respect  stakeholders  with  differing  viewpoints  and  look  for  areas  of  common ground. 3.6.7.  AFCEC/CP  will  assist  the  base  with  planning  and  execution  of  the  public  release meeting.  The AFCEC staff will typically arrive on base the day before the public meeting to be  available  to  brief  Installation/Wing  leadership  and  provide  training  in  AICUZ  and  risk communications  for  the  installation  staff  who  will  be  participating  in  the  AICUZ  public release. AFH32-7084  2 NOVEMBER 2017 31 Chapter 4 WHEN TO UPDATE OR AMEND AN AICUZ STUDY lose  confidence in the the  community  may 4.1.  Introduction  .    There  is  an  art  to  knowing  when  to  update  an  AICUZ  study.    Too  long between  updates  and information  and recommendations contained in an existing study.  Too frequent updates may cause a community to  lose confidence in  its ability to  make informed, long-term planning decisions beneficial to  a base  and  its  missions.    While  priorities  within  local  communities  may  change  with  respect  to land  use  and  property  rights,  the  procedures  set  forth  within  the  AICUZ  Program  can  provide future  planning  stability  for  both  the  community  and  the  base.    This  chapter  discusses  AICUZ study  maintenance,  including  when  operational  data  should  be  reviewed  and  when  an  AICUZ study or update is or is not required.  Operations will vary depending on missions, world events, and  budgetary  considerations.    Installations  will  receive  new  airframes  –  will  the  new  aircraft expand  or  contract  the  contours?    Will  changes  in  training  tactics  increase  night  operations  or expand noise contours?  Will a new departure affect a new noise sensitive area?  These are the types of things that might drive an AICUZ update. 4.2.  AICUZ  Exemptions.  As  mentioned  in  section  3.1.1,  not  all  installations  require  AICUZ studies.    Before  you  decide  whether  an  AICUZ  amendment  or  update  is  needed,  you  need  to know  if  the  installation  is  exempt  from  preparing  and  releasing  an  AICUZ.    Exemptions  are provided for the following circumstances: 4.2.1.  The installation’s AICUZ footprint does not extend beyond the installation boundary.  Review  current  mission  and  planning  noise  contours,  as  well  as  APZs,  HAFZ  and  any identified  areas  of  critical  concern  to  determine  the  full  geographical  extent  of  the  AICUZ footprint. 4.2.2.  Noise zones may not extend off base if the installation has extensive acreage and the airfield is located well within the installation boundaries.  At smaller installations, the noise zones will not typically extend outside the installation’s boundaries if there are less than 10 jet  or  25  propeller-driven  aircraft  operations  or  less  than  250  helicopter  operations  on  an average annual day. 4.2.3.  The installation is located on a civilian owned and operated Airfield (See section 1.3 of AFI 32-7063 for more detail). 4.3.  Just  because  a  base  is  exempt  from  preparing  an  AICUZ  study  and  releasing  it  to surrounding  communities  doesn’t  mean  the  base  cannot  prepare  a  study.  Depending  on local conditions and the base’s relationship with the community, an AICUZ study could be the basis  for  a  protective  overlay  zone  or  other  development  control  that  promotes  land  use compatibility or a collaborative Joint Land Use Study (JLUS).  The local IEMT should consider these possible benefits  of preparing an AICUZ in  cases where a study is not  required.  Section 4.4  of  AFI  32-7063  outlines  the  process  for  exempting  an  installation  from  preparing  and releasing an AICUZ. 4.4.  Review  of  AICUZ  Currency.  Having a published AICUZ or an AICUZ exemption does not  permanently  end  an  installation’s  AICUZ  responsibilities.    All  installations  must  annually review the AICUZ Update Checklist to determine if an installation needs an AICUZ update. In addition  to  operational  data  that  could  affect  noise  zones,  the  checklist  also  covers  operational 32 AFH32-7084  2 NOVEMBER 2017 changes  that  could  affect  APZs,  major  changes  in  off-base  land  use  and  changes  to  AICUZ guidance  (particularly  on  land  use).    During  the  annual  review,  the  AICUZ  PM  examines  the data  to  see  if  their  study  requires  updating  while  installations  with  AICUZ  study  exemptions determine  if  the  criteria  used  to  establish  the  exemption  remain  valid.    If  an  existing  AICUZ study is outdated or the exemption criteria are no longer valid, the installation must initiate Phase I  of  a  new  study  –  AICUZ  data  collection.    The  AICUZ  Update  Checklist  is  available  on  the AFCEC/CP Regional Development SharePoint® site under the AICUZ Program Toolbox tab at https://portal.afcec.hedc.af.mil/CP/CPP/CPPR/SitePages/Home.aspx.   Among  the  items covered by the checklist are the qualitative and quantitative processes for noise contours. 4.4.1.  The  Qualitative  Noise  Contour  Screening  Process.    A  cursory  review  of  operational changes in the NMODD since the last AICUZ may reveal if an update to the AICUZ noise contours is warranted.  Generally, the noise contours will not have changed enough if there have  been  no  major  changes  to  flight  tracks  near  or  overflight  of  noise  sensitive  areas;  no changes  in  operational  aircraft  mix;  a  less  than  25%  increase  or  decrease  in  annual operations;  or  a  less  than  15%  increase  in  night  operations  (from  10:00  PM  to  7:00  AM).  However, these changes may not necessarily mean that you need an update.  If the increase or  decrease  is  due  to  a  temporary  change  (i.e.  shifting  operations  to  or  from  a  base  due  to temporary  runway  closure,  increase  in  training  or  readiness  operations  due  overseas contingencies, temporary deployment of squadrons, etc.), examine the overall trend to see if the change is just an aberration.  See AFI 32-7070, Attachment 4, for more information. 4.4.2.  The  Quantitative  Noise  Contour  Screening  Method.    This  method  requires  a  full operational data collection and the generation of a noise contour and would normally be done if  the  qualitative  screening  process  shows  a  possibility  of  a  significant  change  in  noise contours.    The  threshold  for  AICUZ  updating  actions  is  a  change  in  Day-Night  Average Sound Level (DNL) or Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL, California only) of 2 dB or more in a noise sensitive or controversial area identified in the last publicly released noise exposure map.  The noise modeling computer program, NOISEMAP, can determine if the dB threshold  has  been  exceeded  at  selected  critical  locations.    AFCEC/CP  can  also  assist  the base with a complete analysis to determine if the installation needs to update their AICUZ. 4.5.  Relationship  with  EIAP  Program  .    There  could  be  changes  to  noise  contours  that  will drive an AICUZ study update because of a decision on a proposed action analyzed through the Air Force EIAP. Sometimes, a number of smaller operational changes may drive an update of the noise  zones.    While  these  changes  may  have  qualified  for  categorical  exclusions  (CATEX), cumulatively, they may warrant updating the AICUZ study. AFH32-7084  2 NOVEMBER 2017 33 CHAPTER 5 AICUZ PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION 5.1.  Introduction.  “We  must  train  the  way  we  fight”  is  more  than  a  platitude.    Today’s  Air Force requires bases capable of day, night and all-weather operations that can accommodate next generation  aircraft.    It  requires  training  areas  with  unencumbered  airspace  and  the  necessary bandwidth for joint operations, net-centric fighters and remotely piloted aircraft.  Ranges that can handle standoff weapons and provide realistic threat training are also required.  Where the needs of  a  modern  Air  Force  and  a  growing  community  meet,  there  exists  the  possibility  for  friction and conflict – or opportunity.  While a fence separates the base and community, what we do can impact our neighbors and what they do can impact our mission.  The AICUZ Program provides an  opportunity  for  collaboration  where  both  the  base  and  community  can  not  only  coexist  but thrive. 5.1.1.  That brings us to the Principles of Preservation of Military Bases: 5.1.1.1.  Axiom  I.    Military  bases  do  not  operate  in  a  vacuum  but  are  subject  to  the influences  of  nearby  political  bodies.    These  bodies  will  follow  the  courses  most expedient to their needs.  Cities must look out for the needs of their citizens and ways to keep their growth healthy.  At the same time, developers, landowners and special interest groups will use their influence with elected officials to achieve their own land use goals. 5.1.1.2.  Axiom  II.    Changing  the  course  of  a  political  body  in  motion  will  sometimes create  friction.    The  further  a  body  deviates  from  the  prescribed  course,  the  greater  the energy  required  to  redirect  that  body.    The  first  time  you  insert  your  installation’s interests  into  the  planning  process,  it  may  cause  friction.    The  military,  however,  has  a right  to  an  active  role  in  the  land  use  planning  process.    Over  time,  the  installation’s interests  and  its  role  in  the  community  will  be  recognized  and  you  will  be  viewed  as  a legitimate stakeholder and accepted as part of the process. 5.1.1.3.  Axiom III.  Urban encroachment will slow when a political body assumes your course is most expedient to its needs. 5.1.2.  Working  mission  compatibility  issues  requires  a  proactive  effort.    The  sooner  you enter  the  planning  process  on  an  issue  the  more  open  a  developer  is  to  changes  in  its proposal.   Once the developer commits resources and money to  the project,  they will often fight  any changes tooth  and nail.  An installation  that works with  the community  and is  an active member in the community will thrive. 5.2.  Terminology.  Before  we  get  too  far  into  the  process,  let’s  define  some  key  terms.  Additional terms and acronyms are in Attachment 1. 5.2.1.  According  to  the  Meriam  Webster  dictionary,  the  term  ‘encroachment’  means  “to gradually  take  or  begin  to  use  or  affect  something  that  belongs  to  someone  else  or  that someone  else  is  using.”    Remember  –  encroachment  doesn’t  mean  the  same  to  everyone.  Perceptions of what encroachment is or is not can vary from community to community.  We – the Air Force – must ensure communities understand what encroachment means to us and we must understand what encroachment means to them. 34 AFH32-7084  2 NOVEMBER 2017 5.2.1.1.  AFI  90-2001,  Encroachment  Management,  defines  encroachment  as  “any deliberate action by any governmental or non-governmental entity or individual that does, or is likely to, inhibit, curtail, or impede current or future military activities or deliberate military  activity that is,  or is  likely to be, incompatible with  the community’s use of its resources.”  In simple terms, encroachment is what others do to us (DoD), what we do to others, and what we do to ourselves.  Encroachment is a two-way street.  While we may look at new housing in a high noise zone as an encroachment, it is very likely that people within the community who find their dream home in a noise zone that has expanded due to a mission realignment or new aircraft beddown may feel it is the Air Force doing the encroaching.    Also  note,  we  can  create  self-encroachment  through  Air  Force  or  DoD activities that interfere with a military mission. 5.2.2.  Installation  Encroachment  Management  Team  (IEMT).    The  IEMT  serves  as  the base’s focal point for encroachment issues.  It is a cross-functional decision-making team for long-term,  collaborative  planning  and  problem  solving.    The  team  will  analyze  issues, develop responses, monitor activities, coordinate with higher EMTs, and engage internal and external stakeholders. 5.2.2.1.  The  IEMT  Executive  Director  acts  as  the  installation  lead  for  coordinating AFEM  Program  activities,  reports  to  the  installation  commander,  and  serves  as  the primary  advisor  to  leadership  on  encroachment  challenges  and  proposed  management strategies. 5.2.2.2.  IEMT  members  are  cross-functional  and  drawn  from  foundational  programs already  supporting  encroachment  management.   Tenant  and/or  mission  partner participation in the IEMT is important. 5.2.3.  Installation  Complex/Mission  Footprint  (IC/MF).    The  land,  facilities,  airspace,  and ranges  providing  direct  mission  support  compose  the  Installation  Complex  (IC)  and  are owned, managed or controlled by the installation. 5.2.3.1.  Traditionally,  we  have  focused  on  the  area  around  the  air  installation  when attempting  to  address  encroachment  challenges  or  concerns.    While  the  airfield  is  of primary importance, most of the training mission is accomplished using military training routes,  airspace  training  areas,  and  ranges  that  fall  within  the  mission  footprint.    The encroachment  challenges  within  the  IC/MF,  away  from  the  airfield  environs,  are  the normally  the  responsibility  of  the  IEMT  unless  assigned  to  the  AICUZ  Program Manager. 5.2.3.2.  Depending on an installation’s training requirements, owned or controlled assets may  not  adequately  allow  for  completion  of  training  requirements  and  the  installation may  need  to  use  other  assets.    The  MF  is  composed  of  the  IC  plus  any  land,  facilities, airspace, and ranges which are not managed by the installation but which provide direct, routine support to the mission.  For example, Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands used for training would fall into the MF. 5.2.4.  Region of Influence (ROI).  The ROI is the geopolitical area the installation operates within,  including  both  the  base  and  other  assets,  such  as  airspace  and  training  areas.    This may  include  communities  and  agency-controlled  lands  at  any  government  level.    The  ROI Priority Area is a geographic area where critical mission operations take place or stakeholder AFH32-7084  2 NOVEMBER 2017 35 actions  incompatible  with  mission  operations  are  more  likely.    It  defines  priority  areas  for encroachment concerns and also helps prioritize key stakeholders. 5.3.  Understanding  the  Ground  Rules.  Many  of  the  ground  rules  for  working  with communities  are  based  in  the  law  –  the  law  defines  what  installations  can  and  cannot  do  in everyday  interaction  with  the  public  (see  Table  5.1).    Whenever  you  have  any  concerns  as  to what you legally can or cannot do, ask your Legal Office which has reach-back to AFLOA/JACE for specialized support. Table 5.1.

General.  Preparing and releasing an AICUZ study is just the first step in implementing the AICUZ program as part of the installation’s comprehensive efforts to prevent and minimize the impacts of encroachment.  As a foundational program for the AFEM program, it is not surprising to see the same three elements: organizing, engaging and monitoring are common to both.  The AICUZ  program  focuses  primarily  on  the  area  around  the  air  installation,  while  the  AFEM program  looks  beyond  the  airfield  to  cover  all  aspects  of  the  installation  complex  and  mission footprint, examining a variety of encroachment challenges (see AFI 90-2001).  Since the AICUZ preexists  the  AFEM  program  by  four  decades,  bases  may  not  have  fully  integrated  operate  the two  programs.    In  certain  circumstances,  the  programs  may  operate  separately,  specifically  at installations  especially  those  who  are  exempt  from  preparing  an  AICUZ  study.    Those installations  will  be  organizing,  engaging  and  monitoring  encroachment  threats  through  the AFEM program.  For those installations that do have an active AICUZ program,  chapters 6, 7 and 8 show how both programs can work together in a synergistic approach. 6.1.1.  The  AICUZ  Program  Manager  (PM).    Traditionally,  the  base  planner  served  as  the AICUZ  PM.    While  this  is  still  true  in  many  cases,  Section  2.23.1  of  AFI  32-7063  gives responsibility to appoint the AICUZ PM to the Base Civil Engineer.  However, the AFI also recognizes  the  program  may  fall  under  another  organization.    In  either  case,  the responsibilities  of  the  AICUZ  PM  remain  the  same.    See  Section  2.23.6  in  the  AFI  for AICUZ  PM  responsibilities.    The  AICUZ  PM  must  be  skilled  in  the  AICUZ  and  AFEM programs, as well as knowledgeable of mission operations and urban planning. 6.1.2.  AICUZ  PM  Training.    Few  AICUZ  PM’s  enter  into  the  position  with  the  requisite skill sets but training is available through many sources. 6.1.2.1.  AFCEC/CP  provides  “live”  webinars  of  both  programs  annually  with  more  in-depth  training  for  specialized  topics  offered  several  times  a  year.    Recordings  of  these webinars,  scheduled  future  webinars,  and  self-paced  computer  learning  are  available  on the  AFCEC/CP  Regional  Development  SharePoint®  site  under  the  Training  tab  at https://portal.afcec.hedc.af.mil/CP/CPP/CPPR/SitePages/Home.aspx.   AFCEC/CP staff is available for assistance and mentoring on these topics. 6.1.2.2.  Understanding  the  principles  of  urban  planning  is  essential  since  land  use planning  is  the  primary  means  by  which  the  program  achieves  its  goals.    Joining  a professional  organization  serving  community  planners,  such  as  the  American  Planning Association  (APA),  is  a  good  step  in  that  direction  (official  endorsement  of  this organization  is  neither  expressed  nor  implied).    APA  has  webinars  as  well  as  State chapters  and  more  localized  sections  within  these  chapters.    The  APA  website  contains free  educational  and  training  materials,  including  books  and  publications,  which  will benefit  the  AICUZ  PM.    Also  check  with  your  municipalities  –  they  often  hold orientation training for new planning commissioners.  They may allow you to attend. 6.1.2.3.  The AICUZ PM can learn about  topics, such as installation master planning or the  National  Environmental  Policy  Act  (NEPA),  through  the  Air  Force  Institute  of Technology (AFIT).  Risk Communications and NEPA courses are also offered through 38 AFH32-7084  2 NOVEMBER 2017 the Navy’s Civil Engineer Corps Officers School (CECOS).  The websites for AFIT and CECOS are:  https://www.afit.edu/ and http://www.netc.navy.mil/centers/csfe/cecos/ , respectively. 6.1.2.4.  Public speaking and working with the public outreach team are essentials skills for the AICUZ PM.  If you feel uncomfortable talking before an audience, take a course in  public  speaking  at  a  local  community  college  and  join  an  organization  that  offers public speaking opportunities.  AFH 33-337, The Tongue and Quill (19 November 2015), is  a  very  good  resource  for  learning  basic  communications  skills.    Working  with  the public is  an acquired skill,  developed by experience but  there are resources available to help with this task.  Help in this area is often available through your PA office and with environmental personnel, both of which should have experience in this area.  The FAA’s Community  Involvement  Manual  (February  2016)  provides  a  good  overview  and  is available on the AFCEC/CP Regional Development SharePoint® site in the Outreach and Engagement at https://portal.afcec.hedc.af.mil/CP/CPP/CPPR/SitePages/Home.aspx.  Assistance and guidance  is  also  available  from  the  AICUZ  and  encroachment  management  planners  at AFCEC/CP. the  AICUZ Program folder under Toolbox tab 6.1.2.5.  The  military’s  operational  side  is  often  a  mystery  to  people  without  military service  experience.    The  AICUZ  PM  should  spend  time  visiting  with  flying  units, attending  their  open  houses  and  air  shows.    In  addition,  the  AICUZ  PM  should  learn about  the  installation’s  assigned  aircraft,  flying  missions  and  the  type  of  air  operations performed  at  the  base.    Attend  Airfield  Operations  Board  meetings;  build  interpersonal relationships  with  Airfield  Ops  staff;  regularly  visit  the  Airspace  Manager  and Standardization/Evaluation  offices  and  ask  operational  units  for  mission  briefings.  Consider  enrolling  in  Air  Force  Professional  Military  Education  and  join  the  Air  Force Association.  Take  advantage  of  the  Base  Library  for  military  professional  reading  lists. Visit  the  air  traffic  control  tower  and  have  TERPS  explain  your  base’s  published departures, arrivals and flight publications.  Learning the “language” and terms unique to the operators and understanding their culture will build trust and credibility with them. 6.1.3.  Resources.  The following resources are useful to the AICUZ PM: 6.1.3.1.  AFCEC/CP  publishes  a  bi-weekly  compilation  of  worldwide  AICUZ  and encroachment-related  articles  to  provide  a  glimpse  of  public  and  media  perceptions  of AICUZ and encroachment. Additionally, CP publishers the biannual AFEM Newsletter.  The  Newsletter  provides  the  reader  with  case  studies,  lessons  learned,  frequently  asked questions,  and  technical  articles  on  AICUZ,  encroachment  and  mission  sustainability.  Archived issues of the  AICUZ and encroachment-related articles and the newsletter  are under the Media Monitoring tab at  the AFCEC/CP Regional Development  SharePoint® site at https://portal.afcec.hedc.af.mil/CP/CPP/CPPR/SitePages/Home.aspx. 6.1.3.2.  The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) has sponsored a series of primers on  planning,  outreach  and  engagement  that  will  assist  the  AICUZ  PM  in  working  with various governmental agencies.  These primers include:  Working with State Legislators; Working with Local Governments; Working to Preserve Farm, Forest and Ranch Lands; Commander’s  Guide  to  Community  Involvement;  Collaborative  Land  Use  Planning; Working  with  Regional  Councils;  Outreach  for  Mission  Sustainability:  Working  with Conservation  Districts;  A  Practical  Guide  to  Compatible  Civilian  Development  near AFH32-7084  2 NOVEMBER 2017 39 Military  Installations,  and,  A  Guide  for  Military  Installations.    These  primers  are available on the AFCEC/CP Regional  Development  SharePoint® site under the AICUZ Program  Toolbox and  Engagement at https://portal.afcec.hedc.af.mil/CP/CPP/CPPR/SitePages/Home.aspx. the  Outreach folder) tab (in 6.1.4.  AICUZ  PMs  must  be  familiar  with  all  land  use  studies  associated  with  their  base:  Read the AICUZ study, Installation Development Plan, Installation Complex Encroachment Management Action Plan (ICEMAP), and, if available, the Joint Land Use Study (JLUS). 6.1.5.  The  AICUZ  PM  must  also  engage  with  the  Installation  Encroachment  Management Team  (IEMT).    Find  out  how  your  IEMT  is  organized  and  visit  with  the  IEMT  Executive Director to find out the role the AICUZ PM will play on the team.  Learn your encroachment chain  of  command  and  meet  with  your  PA  and  Legal  offices  to  ensure  you  understand  the rules  for  working  outside  the  fence  and  representing  your  base  to  your  counterparts  in  the community.   If  you need to  establish an  IEMT, AFCEC/CP regional planners can help  you get organized. 6.1.6.  The  AICUZ  PM  should  prepare  and  maintain  a  formal  presentation  of  the  AICUZ program.  Customize the presentations for various audiences, such as citizens’ groups, local planning  commissions,  city  councils,  county  legislatures,  county  planning  commissions, councils of government and other interested agencies. These presentations should inform the public on AICUZ issues, installation mission, installation economic impact, and the need for collaborative land use planning.  The presentation may also be given to  organizations (e.g., Chamber  of  Commerce,  Real  Estate  Board,  neighborhood  associations,  service  clubs,  etc.), elected  officials  and  the  general  public.    Elected  officials  are  ultimately  responsible  for compatible land  use recommendations from a planning commission (made up of appointed local citizens) advised by a planning department.  The biggest impact for elected officials, however, comes from the concerns of the public as well as vested interests.  Review your presentation frequently and keep  it  up  to  date.    Tailor  your  presentations  (consider  various  versions  of  it)  to  meet  the needs of your audience.  If you need help, the AICUZ staff at AFCEC/CP is available to help with sample presentations, graphics, videos and advice. land  use  development.  However, typically receive they 6.2.  Research.  At  this  stage,  the  AICUZ  PM  must  ensure  the  AICUZ  study  is  current  (see section  4.4).    Learn  and  understand  the  local  political  and  planning  environment  in  which  one must operate. 6.2.1.  Research  past  encroachment  issues  and  current  concerns  to  better  understand  the relationship between the base and the community. 6.2.2.  Next,  identify  government  agencies,  organizations  and  individuals  the  AICUZ  PM must  work  with  to  successfully  execute  the  AICUZ  program.    Aside  from  federal,  state, regional and local governments and planning bodies, other organizations often play a role in the process.  Table 6.1 provides a list of agencies that may have an interest in the program.  It is by no means inclusive.  Talk to your counterparts at other bases in the region, as they may be able to identify locally unique players in the process. 6.2.3.  Learn how your local governments are organized.  Know who can educate you on the planning process.  Know the decision makers. 6.2.4.  Find  out  who  are  the  key  staffers  and  planners  who  advise  the  local  government leadership on issues. 40 AFH32-7084  2 NOVEMBER 2017 6.2.5.  Become  familiar  with  the  municipal  plans  and  learn  how  the  local  planning  process operates.    For  instance,  know  which  boards,  commissions,  and  committees  perform  project review  and  approval.  Identify  opportunities  for  the  base  to  enter  into  the  planning  process.  For airports in your ROI, review any Part 150 studies and Airport Improvement Plans – these documents  should  show  you  how  commercial  and  municipal  airports  approach encroachment.  Finally, review your state statutes for military compatibility legislations. Table 6.1.

Obtain calendars and agendas for key meetings.  This can be done by visiting a city or county website, as they have codified this practice as part of the notification process.  Some communities  allow  you  to  sign  up  for  alerts  automatically  sent  to  your  email.    Learn  the procedures for submitting written comments and giving oral testimony.  Times for submittal or  even  signing  up  to  testify  vary.    If  you  don’t  submit  comments  in  time,  the  Air  Force viewpoint will not be heard. 6.2.7.  While the AICUZ PM will spend considerable time working with local governments, make sure you’ve identified the various other organizations involved in the land use planning process.  Real estate professionals, homebuilders’ associations, NGOs and activists all have a role in these processes. 6.2.8.  Identify  the  opinion  leaders  within  the  community.    Opinion  leaders  are  not necessarily elected officials – they are the ones the elected officials and citizens listen to as a voice  of  reason.    Often  they  may  be  a  retired  general  officer  but  could  also  be  a  business leader or community activist. 6.2.9.  Finally, learn who in the community supports your base and its mission and those who have concerns. 42 AFH32-7084  2 NOVEMBER 2017 CHAPTER 7 ENGAGEMENT 7.1.  Introduction.  At this point, it is time to share Air Force mission needs and concerns with the  community  and  to  work  collaboratively  on  land  use  planning.    The  AICUZ  PM  is  the linchpin  of  this  effort,  serving  as  a  liaison  and  bringing  two  diverse  cultures  with  differing perspectives  –  the  military  and  the  community  –  together  on  issues  of  land  use  compatibility.  Remember  that  liaison  goes  both  ways  –  it  is  just  as  important  that  installation  leadership understands  the  community  position  on  land  use  issues  as  it  is  that  the  community  understand why the Air Force must train and fly. 7.2.  Attitude.  “Pardon  my  jet  noise;  it’s  the  sound  of  freedom.”    For  many  years,  this  was  a common sign outside the gate at military airfields.  While some may agree with this sentiment, it may  be  perceived  as  a  slap  to  those  citizens  living  nearby.    As  noted  earlier,  what  we  do  (on-base) can affect our neighbors and what they do (off-base) can affect our mission.  Encroachment management  is  not  about  two  parties  facing  down  each  other  across  a  table.    Encroachment management is a team effort where diverse interests work towards mutually acceptable decisions with  mutually  beneficial  outcomes.    We  build  our  relationships  and  credibility  with  the community  by  being  a  good  neighbor,  participating  and  volunteering  in  local  activities  and events.  We best engage advocacy groups when we understand their motivations and concerns.  We keep the public informed when we temporarily extend our operations hours or flying tempo.  We  are  responsive  to  queries  and  treat  everyone  with  respect—we  are  professional.    Less  than two percent of the U.S. population has served in the military and their only contact with the Air Force  may  be  when  you  respond  to  a  question  at  a  public  meeting.    At  that  time,  you  are representing the Air Force and you do not get a second chance to make a first impression. 7.3.  Proactive  Engagement  .    Encroachment  management  often  requires  a  quick  reaction  to unfolding  events  to  ensure  the  community  hears  the  Air  Force  viewpoint.    Axiom  II  of  “The ‘Principles’ for Conservation of Military Bases” discussed in  Chapter 5 states:  “The further a body deviates from the prescribed course, the greater the energy required to redirect that body.”  To  be  truly  proactive  in  the  encroachment  management  process,  the  AICUZ  PM  must  find  an early entry point into the planning process.  At that point, when developers are looking to move their  project  forward,  they  are  most  receptive  to  working  with  the  military  to  resolve compatibility concerns.  However, once developers have spent time and money on a project they will be less willing to compromise.  Ideally, the AICUZ PM will participate in the early meetings between local  planners  and the developer.   Not only  are developers more willing to  work with the Air Force at this stage, but early engagement also gives the installation time to formulate a response.    Taking  a  proactive  approach  through  early  participation  in  the  planning  process reduces friction and increases the likelihood of a successful collaboration.  This in turn leads to a solid relationship between the installation and the community. 7.4.  Internal Training/Education.  A proactive approach is just as important on base as it is off base.  Developing relationships and regular communications with off-base stakeholders increases the chances of success.  Developing and holding regular AICUZ and encroachment management training on base also increases your chances of success. AFH32-7084  2 NOVEMBER 2017 43 7.4.1.  AICUZ  and  encroachment  management  training  needs  to  start  at  the  top  with Installation/Wing leadership, emphasizing how compatible development helps to protect the defense missions. 7.4.2.  As a foundational program to AFEM, basic training in AICUZ is essential for IEMT members to ensure they have an understanding of how compatible land use guidelines work with the encroachment challenges. 7.4.3.  Education  for  the  operational  units  is  also  essential.    Educating  the  flying  units  on community concerns gives them an awareness of public concerns and why noise abatement techniques are essential. 7.4.4.  Webinar  recordings  of  AICUZ  and  AFEM  seminars  are  available  on  AFCEC/CP Regional  Development  SharePoint®  site  under  the  Training  tab.    Additional  AICUZ resources,  including  videos,  are  available  under  the  AICUZ  Program  Toolbox  tab  at https://portal.afcec.hedc.af.mil/CP/CPP/CPPR/SitePages/Home.aspx.  Two of the videos, AICUZ:  The Commander’s Role and The AICUZ Program, are particularly useful for giving an overview of the program and command responsibilities.  Additionally, AFCEC/CP staff is available for assistance and mentoring. 7.5.  Boots on the Ground.  The AICUZ program cannot be implemented solely from behind a desk; it is important that the AICUZ PM go to the field. 7.5.1.  Every  day,  read  the  local  papers  and  review  planning  meeting  announcements  and legal  notices  to  determine  if  any  of  the  upcoming  actions  have  the  potential  to  affect  your installation’s defense missions.  Visit local government websites for public meeting agendas.  Sign  up  for  automated  alerts  and  invitations  to  public  hearings.    Check  with  your  PA  to ensure you are on the distribution list for media monitoring articles concerning your base. 7.5.2.  At  least  weekly,  get  out  of  the  office  and  drive  your  installation  perimeter  and  the AICUZ  footprint,  looking  for  rezoning  notices,  large  tracks  of  property  for  sale,  freshly cleared land and other signs of potential development.  Proposed utility expansions, such as sewers and waterlines, are also indicators of potential development.  Look for new buildings, such  as  fire  stations  or  police  substations,  as  indicators  of  future  population  growth.    Note buildings or large tracts  of land for sale or available for development  that could  potentially harbor incompatible uses.  Finally, watch existing development for changes in use that may be incompatible with the installation mission. 7.5.3.  To successfully monitor and evaluate off-base land use development plans, installation personnel must establish and maintain contact with planning and other officials at appropriate municipal  and  county  offices  where  land  use  issues  are  handled.  Establish  lines  of communication with other applicable government agencies (councils of government, airport authorities,  other  military  installations,  utility  districts,  etc.)  and  area  offices  of  federal  and state  agencies  (State  Airport  Board,  State  Real  Estate  Commission,  Office  of  Economic Planning  and  Development,  HUD,  VA,  FHA,  FAA,  etc.).  These  agencies  can  influence proposed developments near air installations. 7.5.4.  Like any other landowner, the Air Force has the right to express concern for planning and  zoning  issues.    The  Air  Force  needs  representatives  at  these  meetings  to  convey  Air Force  interests.  Regularly  attend  and  participate  in  appropriate  zoning  commission,  city council,  county  board,  and  other  meetings  and  hearings,  which  could  potentially  affect  the installation. In order to obtain additional information on future development plans or changes 44 AFH32-7084  2 NOVEMBER 2017 in use affecting the installation, attend and participate at meetings of local airport authorities, council  of  governments,  utility  districts,  real  estate  associations,  homebuilder  associations, etc.    Are  elected  and  appointed  officials  discussing  potential  development  issues  not  yet  in the  planning  process?    Does  the  public  testimony  include  possible  development  issues  or issues of concern about your base’s missions? 7.5.5.  When  a  possible  encroachment  challenge  is  identified,  the  IEMT’s  cross-functional approach  can  assist  in  the  preparation  of  the  installation’s  response  to  the  appropriate decision-making  authority.    When  needed,  enlist  additional  support  from  the  flying  wings, base  operations,  etc.    Remember  too,  that  reach-back  support  is  available  from  the  AICUZ planners  at  AFCEC/CP.    Maintain  complete  records  of  all  AICUZ  actions  and  enter  those records in the IEMT’s minutes. 7.5.6.  Once  a  land  use  proposal  has  been  determined  as  incompatible  with  the  AICUZ guidelines, the installation must assess the impact and inform the appropriate agencies of its concerns.  Be sure to coordinate with Legal and PA before stating any preliminary or official position or making a presentation at a public meeting. 7.5.6.1.  Open  and  early  discussions  with  the  applicant  will  determine  if  modifications can be made to the proposal to avoid impacting the installation’s operations.  If a public hearing is held, the AICUZ PM should attend to voice specific concerns.  If the decision-making body is a board or commission, such as a local planning board, members should be  briefed  prior  to  the  hearing.  Some  boards  hold  executive  sessions  prior  to  a  public hearing.    If  the  process  allows,  present  the  installation’s  concerns  both  verbally  and  in written  form.    The  installation  should  be  prepared  to  provide  information  to  the  news media  explaining  the  facts,  reasons  and  key  messages  for  not  supporting  the  proposed development. the concerns installation’s 7.5.6.2.  Presenting involving Installation/Wing  leadership,  the  AICUZ  PM,  Public  Affairs,  Legal,  and  any  necessary Subject  Matter  Experts  (SMEs),  such  as  the  Airspace  Manager,  Frequency  Spectrum Manager, Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection, etc.  The team should determine who should speak,  what  information  should  be  released,  and  to  whom  it  should  be  directed.    The installation should negotiate with the decision-making body to achieve a result protecting the vital interests of the installation. is a team effort 7.6.  Networking.  Networking  is  a  form  of  interaction  regularly  practiced  by  urban  planners.  Networking  is  an  informal  interaction  and  free  flow  of  information  that  builds-effective relationships.    It  occurs  at  chance  encounters  or  during  down  time  at  meetings.    Because  it  is unstructured, networking may cover a wide range of topics, leading to serendipitous discoveries.  Networking  is  one  of  the  most  productive  means  of  communication.    Take  advantage  of networking opportunities by meeting regularly with planning professionals, going out for coffee or even lunch.  You will gain clearer insight into community issues while informally educating others on your installation’s missions and concerns. 7.7.  Communication, Outreach and Engagement.  The ability to formulate and communicate complex  thoughts  sets  humankind  aside  from  the  rest  of  the  animal  kingdom.    Sometimes communication  is  succinct  and  to  the  point  –  other  times  it  is  not.    In  1863,  Edward  Everett delivered  a  13,607-word  speech  to  dedicate  a  battlefield  cemetery  at  a  previously  little  known crossroads  community in Pennsylvania.  Known as the  “finest  orator in  the country,” Everett’s AFH32-7084  2 NOVEMBER 2017 45 two-hour oration was eclipsed by ten sentences – 271 words – delivered by President Abraham Lincoln in a speech known today as the Gettysburg Address.  Few communicators are as skilled as  President  Lincoln.    In  our  business,  poor  communication  skills  and  unclear  messaging  can lead to misunderstandings, community discord and even affect our mission. 7.7.1.  Communication is basically one-way or two-way.  The one-way approach allows the sender to frame a specific message often on short notice but, by nature, this approach allows little  distribution  control  and  allows  no  direct  feedback  such  as  in  press  releases.    These communications  are  normally  prepared  by  PA,  vetted  through  the  base  legal  office,  and approved by installation leadership. 7.7.2.  Outreach  is  a  limited  two-way  communication  approach  that  is  presentational  in nature, typically conducted by Air Force personnel and crafted for a specific audience.  The briefings  are  informational  with  stakeholder  questions  following  the  presentation.    These presentations  are  generally  prepared  by  the  AICUZ  PM  with  assistance  from  PA  and, depending on the level of audience, conducted by either the AICUZ PM or Installation/Wing leadership.    Build  your  outreach  briefing  off  a  stable  of  existing  presentations  and  tailor  it toward  a  specific  issue  and/or  stakeholder.    Section  6.1.6  of  this  handbook  discusses  the AICUZ brief. 7.7.3.  Engagement is two-way communication and conversational,  involving true dialogue between the Air Force and stakeholders.  Because of its open and direct nature, engagement requires  a  high  level  of  preparation,  possibly  involving  Air  Force  SMEs  and  coordination with the legal and public affairs offices (see Table 7.1 for some basic rules of engagement).  Direct  engagement  is  beneficial  to  both  the  installation  and  stakeholders  as  it  helps  build  a collaborative  environment.    There  are  many  venues  suitable  for  engagement  on  AICUZ issues – the following are just a few examples: Table 7.1.  Rules of Engagement. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. Treat all attendees with respect. Determine when Installation/Wing leadership should be involved in engagement and when it is appropriate for staff and the AICUZ PM. Utilize Air Force approved themes and messages to educate stakeholders about the role of the installation in the community. Identify stakeholders and establish relationships. Build on and sustain those relationships. Coordinate internally with tenant units and mission partners to fully understand all mission requirements and related encroachment impacts. Learn to identify decision makers and opinion makers. Do: 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. Stay on message. Attend public meetings to raise awareness of installation issues and understand community concerns. Ensure installation messages and communications are consistent with past language/interactions. Reach back for SME support as appropriate. Arrive early, leave late. Answer all questions. If you don’t know the answer, let them know you will get back to them and do. Provide concise answers. Upset people will hear what they expect to hear. 46 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. Ignore community complaints or conversations regarding encroachment challenges. Use contradictory statements. View community concerns/complaints regarding Air Force missions as reflecting a lack of patriotism. Respond to community criticisms with attacks. Shift blame or responsibility for Air Force encroachment upon the community. Accept or receive gifts from stakeholders. Don’t: 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. AFH32-7084  2 NOVEMBER 2017 Approach community meetings with aggressive, rigid demands. Brief community members with unfamiliar jargon or acronyms. Express personal opinions. Assume that external stakeholders understand Air Force missions or installation requirements. Allow professional disagreements to dissolve into personal conflicts. 7.7.3.1.  A  Land  Use  Forum  is  a  half-day  to  full-day  event  where  external  land  use stakeholders (i.e., land use agencies, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), developers, etc.)  and  Air  Force  representatives  participate  in  presentations  and  panels  to  discuss strategies  for  achieving  compatible  development.    These  forums  develop  a  sense  of collaboration between all stakeholders 7.7.3.2.  Community  Leaders’  Forums  are  hosted  by  Installation/Wing  leadership  and provide  local  stakeholders  a  chance  to  meet  key  leadership  and  staff  to  learn  about encroachment  concerns  and  upcoming  events  and  exercises.    The  stakeholders  may  be opinion  leaders,  senior  staff  from  local  and  regional  governments,  and  representatives from homeowners associations, NGOs, and Chambers of Commerce.  After the Air Force presents issues of interest, the stakeholders participate in a roundtable discussion of these and other issues. 7.7.3.3.  Installation Air Shows.  Air shows and open houses present unique opportunities for  an  installation  to  host  the  community  on  base,  foster  a  better  understanding  of  our mission  and  to  meet  our  men  and  women  in  uniform.    Often,  with  air  shows  and  other special  events,  we  provide  opportunities  for  elected  officials  and  community  leaders  to meet  in  a  relaxed  atmosphere  with  the  base/wing  leadership.    Air  shows  often  have  a practice day with a full air show – without the public.  Meet with your leadership and PA to  propose  inviting  the  staffers,  planners,  and  community  volunteers  out  with  their families to get to know us and learn what we do for a living. 7.7.3.4.  Open House Meetings (other than the public release meeting).  An open house is an  excellent  venue  for  two-way  communications  between  the  community  and  the  Air Force.  The open house can be set up with poster stations and Air Force SMEs to discuss issues of concern and interest  to  both  the installation  and the community.  Stakeholders could  include  elected  officials  or  staff  from  federal,  state,  regional  and  local governments,  real  estate  professionals, land  use  planning  agencies,  developers, landowners, and the public.  See section 3.6 for an example of the AICUZ open house. 7.7.3.5.  Additional  resources  on  Outreach  and  Engagement  are  available  on  the AFCEC/CP Regional Development SharePoint® site under the AICUZ Program Toolbox tab at https://portal.afcec.hedc.af.mil/CP/CPP/CPPR/SitePages/Home.aspx.   AFH32-7084  2 NOVEMBER 2017 47 7.8.  Special  Stakeholders.  Table  4.1  presents  a  list  of  potential  invitees to  the  AICUZ  public release  and  Table  6.1  presents  a  list  of  potential  agencies  and  organizations  with  an  interest  in AICUZ.    There  are,  however,  certain  groups  who  should  be  included  in  your  daily  outreach including: 7.8.1.  Elected  and  Appointed  Officials.    While  much  of  the  communication  with  elected officials  will  occur  at  the  Installation/Wing  leadership  level,  the  AICUZ  PM  needs  to  stay involved to ensure the Air Force message on encroachment is seamless and consistent.  One way  to  stay  connected  with  elected  officials  is  through  their  staff.    Staff  serve  the  elected officials  by  helping  formulate  positions  and  assist  with  constituent  communications.    The AICUZ  PM  should  look  for  opportunities  to  network  with  staff  and  educate  them  directly.  One  venue  for  educating  elected  and  appointed  officials  and  their  staff  is  through  public workshops for city councils and planning commissions.  These meetings are normally open to  the  public  as  a  condition  of  Sunshine  Laws,  which  generally  prohibit  a  “quorum”  (a numerical majority of an elected body) from meeting and discussing official business without public participation. 7.8.2.  Planners.  Local and regional government planners help formulate land use policy and advise  elected  officials  on  land  use  development.    However,  few  planners  have  a  general understanding of our national security mission or have direct experience with the AICUZ or AFEM  programs.    Opportunities  exist  for  outreach  and  engagement,  such  as  setting  up AICUZ training directly with planning organizations or participating in national, chapter and section  meetings  and  events  held  by  professional  planning  organizations.    If  you  are  in  a region  with  multiple bases, consider partnering in  your outreach efforts  or jointly hosting a planning section meeting with  AICUZ/AFEM training that includes viewpoints and lessons learned  from  other  bases/services.    AICUZ  PMs  and  community  planners  should  become intimately familiar with and speak fluently about development codes and zoning ordinances of their neighboring jurisdictions.  This  is  critical  for constructive  conversations about  land use controls, districts, annexations, and local government strategies to implement protective measures supporting the flying mission. 7.8.3.  Real Estate Professionals.  Real estate professionals play an important role in ensuring potential  buyers  are  aware  of  noise  and  other  impacts  from  nearby  military  installations.  While  not  all  communities  require  fair  disclosure  of  noise  and  other  military  impacts,  real estate professionals still have a fiduciary responsibility to ensure their clients understand any potential issues that could affect their enjoyment of a new home.  However, few real estate professionals  have  awareness  of  the  military  mission  or  AICUZ,  leaving  open  the opportunity  for  training.    Almost  every  Tuesday  or  Wednesday,  real  estate  brokers  hold training  for  agents  and  they  are  always  looking  for  guest  speakers.    Local  chapters  of  real estate  organizations,  such  as  the  National  Association  of  Realtors®  (NAR),  typically  hold annual training workshops and often seek articles of interest for their respective newsletters and publications. 7.8.3.1.  The  AFCEC/CP  Regional  Development  SharePoint®  site  contains  a  video designed to educate real estate professionals on AICUZ and the need for disclosure.  This video  is  available  at  the AFCEC/CP  Regional  Development  SharePoint® site  under  the AICUZ at https://portal.afcec.hedc.af.mil/CP/CPP/CPPR/SitePages/Home.aspx.

Real  estate  professionals  also  present  a  good  opportunity  for  collaboration.  Brokers subscribe to Multiple Listing Services (MLS) that allows them to access a list of homes for sale and the details of each property.  The AICUZ PM should work with the real estate professionals to ensure that prospective buyers see noise zones and APZs for affected properties. 7.8.4.  Developers.  Like real estate professionals, developers have little understanding of the AICUZ  program.    However,  through  homebuilder  associations,  opportunities  open  up  for training.    Of  particular  interest  is  how  incorporating  noise  level  reduction  into  homes  can increase the quality of life for those impacted by aircraft noise.  See section 2.12.2 for further information for resources on sound insulation. 7.8.5.  Media.    At  times,  some  may  perceive  the  media  as  hostile  –  more  likely,  they  are uninformed  about  the  military  with  little  experience  in  working  with  the  armed  services.  Work with your PA to develop and release ‘good news’ stories about the base to educate the public,  provide  base  tours,  and  develop  ‘background’  briefs  about  the  AICUZ  and  AFEM programs  for  the  media.    The  concept  of  media  has  evolved.    Today,  anyone  with  a  smart phone can be considered media.  A smart phone thrust in your face at a public meeting can lead  to  a  posting  on  YouTube  ®.    Work  with  your  PA  on  how  to  handle  requests  for impromptu interviews and where you can go for training. 7.8.6.  The Public.  Often the public’s concern over our operations could be as simple as late night operations keeping the baby awake.  The AICUZ PM should look for opportunities to present  the  base  mission,  AICUZ  and  AFEM  programs  to  the  public.    Often,  homeowner associations  are  looking  for  relevant  presentations  for  their  meetings.    When  attending meetings, you are the ‘eyes and ears’ of your command.  Listen to your neighbors and bring their  concerns  back  to  the  base  for  resolution,  if  possible.    Often,  just  listening  will  reduce their concerns. 7.9.  Working  with  Other  Bases.  In  regions  where  multiple  bases  and  services  are  located, ensure that community efforts are coordinated.  All services experience encroachment challenges to  some  degree,  particularly  those  resulting  from  urban  growth.    The  DoD  message  must  be consistent and this requires cooperation. AFH32-7084  2 NOVEMBER 2017 49 CHAPTER 8 MONITORING AND CONCLUSION 8.1.  Monitoring.  Monitoring  for  operational  changes  is  critical  to  a  successful  AICUZ program.    Change  is  the  only  constant  in  our  temporary  world.    Operational  tempo  varies depending  on  budget,  mission  and  world  events.    New  aircraft  enter  the  inventory  and  legacy aircraft  retire.    Maintaining  situational  awareness  is  critical  to  mission  preservation  and sustainability.  As missions and communities change and public perceptions evolve, we need to adapt our AICUZ implementation strategies to compensate. 8.1.1.  The  AICUZ  PM  is  responsible  for  monitoring  AICUZ  implementation,  which  will generally involve the airfield environs.  These responsibilities should be coordinated with the IEMT to ensure that there are no gaps in coverage and that overlap is minimal. 8.1.2.  While  we  continue  to  monitor  encroachment  indicators  through  media  monitoring, networking,  and  participation  in  the  planning  process,  there  are  some  events  that  may  be game changers: 8.1.2.1.  Changes on the airfield can be caused by new missions, addition or closure of a runway, introduction of a new aircraft, changes in flight tracks, etc., possibly leading to changes in the AICUZ footprint.  Be alert for operational changes that could alter flight tracks, runway preference, and operational tempo. 8.1.2.2.  Updates to the noise contours and revisions to the AICUZ study might require a change  in  strategy  when  working  with  the  community.    Communities  seldom  consider temporary operational changes, such as deployments or runway repairs, in their land use policy.  Communities think long term when considering their development and growth in much  the  same  way  we  think  long  term  when  considering  the  sustainability  of  our installations and missions. 8.1.2.3.  Changes  in  federal  or  state  legislation  or  regulations  may  also  impact  the mission.    Federal  air  quality  requirements  could  negatively  affect  aircraft  basing  by restricting operations in a non-attainment area.  State legislation can result in granting or broadening  zoning  authority  to  local  communities.    However,  legislators  can  also  roll back  existing  enabling  legislation  and  prevent  communities  that  want  to  help  protect bases  and  missions  from  adopting  land  use  controls  beneficial  to  our  missions.    As discussed in Chapter 6, you should become familiar with the elected representatives for your community. 8.1.2.4.  On the local level, emerging city development plans and even annexations could impact our AICUZ implementation strategies. 8.1.2.5.  Political climates also change.  The next election could bring in a pro-growth or no  growth  City  Council.    Each  election  cycle  will  likely  require  an  update  of  your stakeholders’  list  and  changes  in  outreach  strategy.    It  is  essential  that  the  AICUZ  PM introduces  themselves  to  newly  elected  officials  or  their  staff,  establishes  positive relationships and seizes opportunities to advise and educate them about the base, the base missions and the AICUZ program. 50 AFH32-7084  2 NOVEMBER 2017 8.1.2.6.  Finally, emerging technologies may create new encroachment challenges similar to  the  way  renewable  energy  resources  and  personal  communication  systems  have presented new challenges in the past two decades. 8.1.3.  As  changes  occur,  we  improvise,  adapt,  and  overcome.    To  stay  relevant,  we  must modify  implementation  strategies  when  necessary  to  effectively  promote  and  achieve compatible development. 8.2.  Conclusion.  The  AICUZ  program  provides  the  tools  to  achieve  compatible  development.  In practice, we – the Air Force – may not achieve all the land use controls we seek.  We need to know when to compromise – sometimes getting something is better than getting nothing.  There are also  times we cannot reach agreement.  At that point, we need to  re-evaluate our strategies and our relationship with the community and try another approach. 8.2.1.  This  handbook  provides  the  tools  you  need  to  implement  an  AICUZ  program.  However, it is not the end all in AICUZ and managing encroachment.  Network with other AICUZ  PMs  to  learn  their  strategies  and  what  has  or  has  not  worked  for  their  base.    Take advantage of available training and reach back support. 8.2.2.

AAD is calculated by dividing the total annual airfield operations by 365 days. Attenuation—A decrease in a property, as energy, per unit area of a wave or a beam of particles, occurring as the distance from the source increases as a result of absorption, scattering, spreading in three dimensions. BASEOPS—A computerized program for entering operational data needed to compute the total noise exposure around an installation. C-weighted Day-Night  Average Sound Level  (CDNL or symbol-LCdn)—CDNL is used for low  frequency  impulsive  sounds,  such  as  sonic  booms,  heavy  weapons,  and  other  explosions because  they  are  perceived  by  humans  not  only  by  the  ear,  but  also  by  the  whole  body  as pressure  or  vibration.  When  experienced  indoors,  impulsive  sounds  can  create  secondary  noise from rattling and vibrations of the building.  See DNL for additional discussion.  (See ANSI S1.1 for scientifically agreed upon definition.) Community  Noise  Equivalent  Level  (CNEL  [symbol  Lden])—CNEL  is  similar  to  DNL  but adds an evening penalty of 5 dB to all operations occurring between the hours of 7:00 p.m. and 10:00  p.m., in  addition to the night  penalty of 10 dB from  10:00  p.m. until 7:00 a.m.  CNEL is used  for  land  use  planning  and  environmental  analysis  for  all  installations  in  the  State  of California. (See also DNL.).  NOTE:  The symbol Lden should not be confused with the noise descriptor  used  in  Japan,  Day,  Night,  Evening  Level,  abbreviated  Lden.    Although  CNEL  and Lden  are  similar,  in  that  each  has  an  evening  penalty,  CNEL  defines  evening  as  a  three-hour period and Japan defines evening as a four-hour period.   AFH32-7084  2 NOVEMBER 2017 55 Day  Night  Average  Sound  Level  (DNL  [symbol—Ldn]—A  twenty  four  hour  average  A-weighted sound level for a given day after the addition of a 10 dB weighting is added to account for the increased sensitivity of humans to noise from such things as aircraft operations for sound levels that occur between the hours of 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. because ambient sound levels  at night are typically lower than during the daytime hours. (See ANSI S1.1 for scientifically agreed upon definition.) Hazards  to  Aircraft  Flight  Zone—This  zone  is  defined  as  the  area  on  the  ground  within  the “Imaginary  Surfaces”  that  are  described  in  the  UFC  3-260-01,  and  in  Federal  Aviation Regulation  (FAR)  Part  77,  Objects  Affecting  Navigable  Airspace,  Subpart  C:  Obstruction Standards.  This  is  the  area  that  will  be  evaluated  for  compatibility  related  to  height,  visual interference, glint/glare, bird/wildlife aircraft strike hazard, and radio frequency/electromagnetic interference. Installation  Complex—The  land,  facilities,  airspace  and  ranges  providing  direct  mission support  to  and/or  are  managed  by  the  installation.  This  includes  a  combination  of  land  and facilities  comprised  of  a  main  installation  and  its  noncontiguous  properties  (auxiliary  airfields, annexes,  and  missile  fields)  that  provide  direct  support  to  or  are  supported  by  that  installation. Installation complexes may comprise two or more properties (e.g., a major installation, a minor installation, or a support site), each with its associated annexes or support properties. Installation  Complex  Encroachment  Management  Action  Plan  (ICEMAP)—The  ICEMAP is  a  planning  product  that  documents  the  results  of  a  comprehensive  encroachment  study addressing  current  and  future  encroachment  and  sustainment  challenges  facing  the  installation complex and surrounding communities. Installation Encroachment Management Team (IEMT)—A cross-functional team established in  accordance  with  section  3.3.2.3  of  AFI  90-2001,  designed  to  address  encroachment  issues within the installation complex. Land  Based  Classification  System—The  Land  Based Classification Standards (LBCS) model extends  the  notion  of  classifying  land  uses  by  refining  traditional  categories  into  multiple dimensions,  such  as  activities,  functions,  building  types,  site  development  character,  and ownership constraints. Each dimension has its own set of categories and subcategories. Noise contour line—Lines on a map connecting points of equal noise levels. NOISEMAP—A suite of computer programs developed for prediction of noise exposure in the vicinity of an installation due to aircraft flight, maintenance, and ground run-up operations. Noise  Zone—A  range  of  noise  levels  generally  bounded  by  two  noise  contours,  e.g.  65-70  dB DNL or >75 dB DNL. Operational  Data—Operational  data  covers  multiple  types  of  data  associated  with  aircraft operations (i.e., type of aircraft, power setting, altitude, flight track, etc.). Peak  Sound  Pressure  (symbol—Lpk)—Level  of  peak  sound  pressure  with  stated  frequency weighting, within a stated time interval. The decibel version of the peak overpressure that is used as needed to describe a noise event such as a sonic boom or blast for the purposes of relating it to human and animal  response.    For impulsive sounds, it is  the true instantaneous sound pressure (e.g., the peak pressure of the shock wave for sonic booms). This pressure is usually presented in physical  units  of  pounds  per  square  foot.  DoD  uses  un-weighted  peak,  so  make  sure  the weighting factor is denoted.  (See ANSI S1.1 for scientifically agreed upon definition.) 56 AFH32-7084  2 NOVEMBER 2017 Standard  Land  Use  Coding  Manual—Published  in  1965  by  the  Federal  Highways Administration  and  the  Department  of  Housing  and  Urban  Development,  the  SLUCM  manual provided  a  detailed  listing  of  land  use  categories  with  numeric  codes  assigned  to  them.    This numeric coding system used two, three, four, or more digits to identify land use activities.  AFH32-7084  2 NOVEMBER 2017 57 LAND USE COMPATIBILITY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR APZS Attachment 2 A2.1.  Suggested  land  use  compatibility  guidelines  in  the  Clear  Zone  and  APZs  are  shown  in Table  A2.1.    Additions  to  some  land  use  categories  have  been  incorporated  into  Table  A2.1 subsequent  to  issuance  of  the  SLUCM  to  reflect  additional  land  uses  and  to  clarify  the categorization of certain uses.

A “Yes” or a “No” designation for compatible land use is to be used only for general comparison.  Within each, uses exist where further evaluation may be needed in each category as to whether it is clearly compatible, normally compatible, or not compatible due to the variation of densities of people and structures.  In order to assist air installations and local governments, general suggestions as to FARs are provided as a guide to density in some categories.  In general, land use restrictions that limit occupants, including employees, of commercial, service, or industrial buildings or structures to 25 an acre in APZ I and 50 an acre in APZ II are considered to be low density.  Outside events should normally be limited to assemblies of not more than 25 people an acre in APZ I, and maximum assemblies of 50 people an acre in APZ II.  Recommended FARs are calculated using standard parking generation rates for various land uses, vehicle occupancy rates, and desired density in APZ I and II.  For APZ I, the formula is FAR = 25 people an acre/ (Average Vehicle Occupancy x Average Parking Rate x (43560/1000)).  The formula for APZ II is FAR = 50/ (Average Vehicle Occupancy x Average Parking Rate x (43560/1000)). 2.  The suggested maximum density for detached single-family housing is two Du/Ac.  In a planned unit development (PUD) of single family detached units, where clustered housing development results in large open areas, this density could possibly be increased slightly provided the amount of surface area covered by structures does not exceed 20 percent of the PUD total area.  PUD encourages clustered development that leaves large open areas. 3.  Other factors to be considered:  Labor intensity, structural coverage, explosive characteristics, air-pollution, electronic interference with aircraft, height of structures, and potential glare to pilots. 4.  No structures (except airfield lighting and navigational aids necessary for the safe operation of the airfield when there are no other siting options), buildings, or above-ground utility and 62 AFH32-7084  2 NOVEMBER 2017 communications lines should normally be located in Clear Zone areas on or off the air installation.  The Clear Zone is subject to the most severe restrictions.   5.  Roads within the graded portion of the Clear Zone are prohibited.  All roads within the Clear Zone are discouraged, but if required, they should not be wider than two lanes and the rights-of-way should be fenced (frangible) and not include sidewalks or bicycle trails.  Nothing associated with these roads should violate obstacle clearance criteria. 6.  No above ground passenger terminals and no above ground power transmission or distribution lines.  Prohibited power lines include high-voltage transmission lines and distribution lines that provide power to cities, towns, or regional power for unincorporated areas. 7.  Development of renewable energy resources, including solar and geothermal facilities and wind turbines, may impact military operations through hazards to flight or electromagnetic interference.  Each new development should to be analyzed for compatibility issues on a case-by-case basis that considers both the proposal and potentially affected mission.  8.  Within SLUCM Code 52, maximum FARs for lumberyards (SLUCM Code 521) are 0.20 in APZ-I and 0.40 in APZ-11;  the maximum FARs for hardware, paint, and farm equipment stores, (SLUCM Code 525), are 0.12 in APZ I and 0.24 in APZ II. 9.  A shopping center is an integrated group of commercial establishments that is planned, developed, owned, or managed as a unit.  Shopping center types include strip, neighborhood, community, regional, and super-regional facilities anchored by small businesses, a supermarket or drug store, discount retailer, department store, or several department stores, respectively.   10.  Ancillary uses such as meeting places, auditoriums, etc. are not recommended. 11.  No chapels or houses of worship are allowed within APZ I or APZ II. 12.  Big box home improvement stores are not included as part of this category. 13.  Facilities must be low intensity, and provide no playgrounds, etc.  Facilities such as clubhouses, meeting places, auditoriums, large classes, etc., are not recommended.   14.  Activities that attract concentrations of birds creating a hazard to aircraft operations should be excluded. 15.  Factors to be considered: labor intensity, structural coverage, explosive characteristics, and air pollution. 16.  Lumber and timber products removed due to establishment, expansion, or maintenance of Clear Zone lands owned in fee will be disposed of in accordance with applicable DoD guidance. 17.  Controlled hunting and fishing may be permitted for the purpose of wildlife management. 18.  Surface mining operations that could create retention ponds that may attract waterfowl and present bird/wildlife aircraft strike hazards (BASH), or operations that produce dust or light emissions that could affect pilot vision are not compatible. 19.  Naturally occurring water features (e.g., rivers, lakes, streams, wetlands) are pre-existing, nonconforming land uses.  Naturally occurring water features that attract waterfowl present a potential BASH.  Actions to expand naturally occurring water features or construction of new water features should not be encouraged.  If construction of new features is necessary for storm water retention, such features should be designed so that they do not attract waterfowl. 20.  Amusement centers, family entertainment centers or amusement parks designed or operated at a scale that could attract or result in concentrations of people, including employees and visitors, greater than 50 people per acre at any given time are incompatible in APZ II.    AFH32-7084  2 NOVEMBER 2017 63 RECOMMENDED LAND USE COMPATIBILITY FOR NOISE ZONES Attachment 3 A3.1.  Suggested  land  use  compatibility  guidelines  for  noise  zones  are  shown  in  Table  A3.1.  Additions  to  some  land  use  categories  have  been  incorporated  into  Table  A3.1  subsequent  to issuance of the SLUCM to reflect additional land uses and to clarify the categorization of certain uses.  Tables A3.2 and Table A3.3 provide land use compatibility recommendations in relation to ground  training  noise  sources  such  as  small  arms  and  blast  noise  from  large  caliber  munitions and  explosives.    The  land  use  compatibility  recommendations  are  provided  for  local governments as well as AF for on-base planning. Table A3.1.  Land Use Compatibility in Aircraft Noise Zones.

NLR (outdoor to indoor) is achieved through the incorporation of noise attenuation into the design and construction of a structure.  Land use and related structures are generally compatible; however, measures to achieve NLR of 25, 30, or 35 must be incorporated into design and construction of structures.  However, measures to achieve an overall noise reduction do not necessarily solve noise difficulties outside the structure and additional evaluation is warranted.  Also, see notes indicated by superscripts where they appear with one of these numbers. DNL – Day-Night Average Sound Level. CNEL – Community Noise Equivalent Level (normally within a very small decibel difference of DNL) Ldn – Mathematical symbol for DNL. NOTES:   1.  General      a. Although local conditions regarding the need for housing may require residential use in these zones, residential use is discouraged in DNL 65-69 and strongly discouraged in DNL 70-74.  The absence of viable alternative development options should be determined and an evaluation should be conducted locally prior to local approvals indicating that a demonstrated community need for the residential use would not be met if development were prohibited in these zones.  Existing residential development is considered as pre-existing, non-conforming land uses.      b. Where the community determines that these uses must be allowed, measures to achieve outdoor to indoor NLR of at least 25 decibels (dB) in DNL 65-69 and 30 dB in DNL 70-74 should be incorporated into building codes and be considered in individual approvals; for transient housing, an NLR of at least 35 dB should be incorporated in DNL 75-79.        c. Normal permanent construction can be expected to provide an NLR of 20 dB, thus the reduction requirements are often stated as 5, 10, or 15 dB over standard construction and normally assume mechanical ventilation, upgraded sound transmission class ratings in windows and doors, and closed windows year round.  Additional consideration should be given to modifying NLR levels based on peak noise levels or vibrations. AFH32-7084  2 NOVEMBER 2017 67      d. NLR criteria will not eliminate outdoor noise problems.  However, building location, site planning, design, and use of berms and barriers can help mitigate outdoor noise exposure particularly from ground level sources.  Measures that reduce noise at a site should be used wherever practical in preference to measures that only protect interior spaces. 2.  Measures to achieve NLR of 25 must be incorporated into the design and construction of portions of these buildings where the public is received, office areas, noise sensitive areas, or where the normal noise level is low. 3.  Measures to achieve NLR of 30 must be incorporated into the design and construction of portions of these buildings where the public is received, office areas, noise sensitive areas, or where the normal noise level is low. 4.  Measures to achieve NLR of 35 must be incorporated into the design and construction of portions of these buildings where the public is received, office areas, noise sensitive areas, or where the normal noise level is low. 5.  If project or proposed development is noise sensitive, use indicated NLR; if not, land use is compatible without NLR. 6.  Buildings are not permitted. 7.  Land use is compatible provided special sound reinforcement systems are installed. 8.  Residential buildings require an NLR of 25 9.  Residential buildings require an NLR of 30. 10.  Residential buildings are not permitted. 11.  Land use that involves outdoor activities is not recommended, but if the community allows such activities, hearing protection devices should be worn when noise sources are present. Long-term exposure (multiple hours per day over many years) to high noise levels can cause hearing loss in some unprotected individuals.   68 AFH32-7084  2 NOVEMBER 2017 Table A3.2.

Land Use Compatibility for Artillery Explosives.   AFH32-7084  2 NOVEMBER 2017 73   74 AFH32-7084  2 NOVEMBER 2017   NOTES:  Note 1: LUPZ- Land Use Planning Zone is a subdivision of Land Use Zone I and functions as a buffer for Noise Zone II. Communities and individuals often have different views regarding acceptable or desirable levels of noise. To address this, some local governments have implemented land use planning measures beyond Noise Zone II limits. In addition to mitigating current noise impacts, implementing such controls within the LUPZ can create a buffer to prevent the possibility of future noise conflicts.  Note 2: Although local requirements for on- or off-base housing may require noise-sensitive land uses within Noise Zone II, such land use is generally not compatible within Noise Zone II. Measures to achieve overall noise level reduction inside structures do not solve noise difficulties outside the structure. Barriers are not effective reducing the noise from artillery and armor, the detonation of either large caliber military munitions or a large quantity of explosives. Additionally, noise level reduction inside structures does not mitigate the vibration generated by the low-frequency energy of large caliber weapons firing and detonations.   AFH32-7084  2 NOVEMBER 2017 75 Note 3: Within Zones, existing “noise sensitive land uses are considered as pre-existing incompatible land uses. In most cases these uses are not a risk to either mission sustainment or a community’s quality of life. Most long-term members near Army installations or activities acknowledge hearing military operations and activities but they are usually not alarmed or bothered by the noise. Note 4: Although noise levels may be compatible, caution should be exercised in siting any activity which may be sensitive to vibration.  76 AFH32-7084  2 NOVEMBER 2017 ATTACHMENT 4 GEOSPATIAL DATA A4.1.  General.  The  AICUZ  program  is  heavily  reliant  on  geospatial  data  when  it  comes  to analyzing  the  compatibility  of  land  uses  and  mission  activities.  Most  of  the  AICUZ  area  of influence lies outside the installation and will require the acquisition and use of geospatial data that comes from external sources, as well as Air Force generated geospatial data layers. A4.1.1.  The  Air  Force  has  developed  a  suite  of  AICUZ  geospatial  data  layers,  map templates,  and  guidance  to  support  enterprise  program  management  and  analysis  (i.e. graduated  noise  levels,  incompatible  land  use,  real  property  interests,  and  safety  hazards).  Other AICUZ geospatial data layers are generated externally.  The standardized AICUZ data and map templates enable simple to complex queries from the tactical to the strategic level in desktop  –  to  –  enterprise  applications  and  facilitate  integration  into  broader  more  complex enterprise  planning  and  analysis  applications  and  scenarios.    All  geospatial  data  used  in support  of  the  AICUZ  program  must  adhere  to  the  latest  AICUZ  geospatial  model  as maintained by Air Force GeoBase Program and AFCEC/CP. A4.2.  AICUZ geospatial data layers created by the Air Force or its contractors.  Layers are available in a point (_P), line (_L), and/or polygon (_A) formats. A4.2.1.  Historic, Current, and Planning aspects of the DNL/CNEL noise contours-plotted in 5 dB increments starting with 65 dB DNL and going to 80 dB.  May start at 60 dB in some locations.    NoiseZone  A  and  NoiseZone  L  -  An  area  (or  the  external  boundary  of  an  area) describing the sound levels attributed to a noise source. The following descriptions come the naming  convention  provided  by  the  OSD  Defense  Installation  Spatial  Data  Infrastructure (DISDI) office. A4.2.2.  Historic  and  Current  aspects  of  the  CDNL  noise  contours  plotted  in  the  following increments  57-62  dB  CDNL,  62-70  dB  CDNL,  and  70+  dB  CDNL.    NoiseZone_A  and NoiseZone_L  -  An  area  (or  the  external  boundary  of  an  area)  describing  the  sound  levels attributed to a noise source. A4.2.3.  Historic  Peak  and  Current  Peak  Noise  Contours  for  Small  Arms  Ranges:  two contours, 87-104 dB Peak, and >104 dB Peak.  NoiseZone_A and NoiseZone_L - An area (or the external boundary of an area) describing the sound levels attributed to a noise source. A4.2.4.  Safety zones, to include Clear Zones, APZs I and II.  AirAccidentZone_A - Areas at the  end  of  runways  or  beneath  approach  and  departure  flight  paths  where  there  is  a  higher potential for aircraft accidents. These areas include clear zones, and accident potential zones (APZ) I and II. Clear zones are areas immediately beyond the end of the runways with a high potential for accidents.  The clear zones are traditionally acquired by the Government in fee or  controlled  through  restrictive  easements  so  they  are  clear  of  both  vegetation  and development.  All of these zones are included in the analysis of land use compatibility with surrounding communities. A4.2.5.  Hazards  to  Aircraft  Flight  Zone  (defined  by  the  airfield  imaginary  surfaces).  AirfieldImaginarySurface_A - The hypothetical surfaces above and around an airfield where there  are  height  restrictions  that  prohibit  obstructions  to  navigable  airspace.  These  surfaces include approach zones, transition zones, etc. AFH32-7084  2 NOVEMBER 2017 77 A4.2.6.  Any  approved  Line  of  Sight/Look  Angle  Zone.      RadarEquipment_A  and RadarEquipment_P – These layers will give the location of equipment used for determining the  presence  and  position  of  an  object  by  measuring  the  direction  and  timing  of electromagnetic waves. A4.2.7.  Non-Conforming  Uses  with  Airfield  Criteria-location  of  obstructions  within  the HAFZ.  AirfieldObst_P - Features whose height intrudes into navigable airspace (SOURCE 2.6 BROWSER). to flight tracks A4.2.8.  Primary include  departure,  arrival  and  closed  pattern.  MilFlightTrack_L  –  Flight  paths  in  and  out  of  the  airfield  traffic  area  on  the  installation.  MilTrainingRoute_L  –  Layer  contains  Low  level  military  training  airspace.    Flights Regulations governing the airspace are conducted under either Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) or Visual  Flight  Rules (VFR).  The airspace is  classified as (IFR) Military  Training Routes (IR),  VFR  Military  Training  Routes  (VR),  or  Slow  Speed  Military  Training  Route  (SR).  This Feature Class represents the turn point and the ends of the edges of each segment within the  route  based  on  the  AP/1B  published  by  the  National  Geospatial-Intelligence  Agency (NGA).    MilLocalFlying_A  -  Airspace  in  the  local  area  to  an  installation  that  supports routine, training activity. These areas are normally developed in conjunction with local FAA controllers and airspace managers and are de-conflicted with other airspace such as Class B, C,  or  D  airspace  or  Special  Use  Airspace  (SUA).    Note:  These  areas  are  separate  from Special Use Airspaces (SUA) and Military Training Routes (MTR). easements.  A4.2.9.
