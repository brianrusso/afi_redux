General. Conduct all evaluations in accordance with (IAW) the provisions of AFI 11-202 Vol 2, theACC supplement to Vol 2 and this instruction. 1.2.  Waivers. Waiver authority for this instruction is the MAJCOM A3. Waivers will be requested fromthe parent MAJCOM A3 through appropriate Stan/Eval channels 1.3.  Procedures.  1.3.1.  The Flight Examiner (FE) will brief the examinee on the purpose of the evaluation and how itwill be conducted prior to the sortie. The examinee will accomplish required flight planning in accor-dance with the flight position during the evaluation. FEs will assist in mission planning/briefing astasked and will be furnished a copy of necessary mission data and mission materials. 1.3.2.  Unless specified, the examinee may fly in any flight position/seat which will best enable the FEto conduct a thorough evaluation. 1.3.3.  If an actual emergency occurs, at a minimum the initial reaction will be evaluated. The FE willuse discretion to determine when to suspend/terminate an evaluation. The FE may, at his or her discre-tion, choose to continue the evaluation. If the evaluation is continued, the evaluator will explicitlyinform the crew of the change. 1.3.4.  FEs should use authorized recording devices (e.g. Air Combat Maneuvering Instrumentation(ACMI), Range Integration Instrumentation System (RIIS), or digital recording) to re-construct/eval-uate the mission. When used, these recordings will be managed as official electronic records IAWAFMAN 33-363 and disposed of only IAW the AF RDS. Contact supporting records professionals. 1.3.5.  The FE will thoroughly critique all aspects of the flight. During the critique, the FE will reviewthe examinee's overall rating, specific deviations, assigned area grades (if other than qualified), andassign any required additional training. 1.3.6.  Required areas are shown in Table 2.1. When it is impossible to evaluate a required areain-flight, it may be evaluated by an alternate method (i.e. Weapons System Trainer (WST) or verbalexamination). FEs will document areas not evaluated in flight, the alternate methods used and justifi-cation in the Additional Comments portion of the AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification. 1.4.  Grading Instructions. Standards and performance parameters are contained in AFI 11-202V2 andthis volume. 1.4.1.  Compare examinee performance for each area accomplished during the evaluation with thearea performance standards contained in AFI 11-202V2 and provided in this volume before assigningan appropriate grade. Exercise judgment for subjective areas and specific situations not covered. 1.4.2.  The FE will base tolerances for in-flight parameters on conditions of smooth air and a stableaircraft. Do not consider momentary deviations from tolerances, provided the examinee appliesprompt corrective action and such deviations do not jeopardize safety. The FE will consider cumula-tive deviations, compare to area grading criteria, and apply judgment when determining overallgrades. AFI11-2B-1V2   13 JUNE 200851.4.3.  FE judgment is the determining factor in arriving at the overall grade. 1.4.4.  General Criteria. The following general criteria apply during all phases of flight except asnoted for specific events and instrument final approaches: Table 1.1.  General Criteria Q Altitude Airspeed/Mach Navigation Tacan Arc Altitude Airspeed/Mach Navigation Tacan Arc Exceeds Q- tolerances + 200 feet + 5% + 3NM + 2NM + 300 feet + 10% + 5 Miles + 3NM  Q-  U 1.5.  Emergency Procedures Evaluation. Conduct EPEs in the Weapons System Trainer (WST). If theWST is unavailable, the EPE may be given verbally. EPEs are commensurate with the examinee's missionstatus (Combat Mission Ready [CMR] or Basic Mission Capable [BMC]). (Note: Airspeed and altitudetolerances are increased 50% for evaluations conducted in the WST.) 1.5.1.  FEs will evaluate crewmembers of like specialty. 1.5.2.  FEs will administer EPEs in the WST as integrated crews. The OG/CC may grant waivers per-mitting an independent mode EPE on a case by case basis. The OG/CC may grant an independent EPEwaiver only for recurring evaluations. Post the MFR in the FEF until AF Form 8 completion, andannotate in the Additional Comments section of the AF Form 8. In no case will two consecutive EPEsbe conducted in independent mode. 1.6.  Documentation of Weapons Employment Results. Document weapons employment results in theMission Description section of the AF Form 8. The abbreviations used to document weapons scores are inaccordance with AFI 11-2B1 Vol 1, B-1 Aircrew Training or current MAJCOM RAP tasking message. 1.6.1.  Air-to-Surface. Record delivery type and weapons grades for each air-to-surface delivery.Weapons delivery hit criteria for MSN evaluations is IAW AFI 11-2B-1V1, B-1 Aircrew Training. Onunmanned ranges where precise scoring is not available or for simulated deliveries, FEs will assessweapons employment results based on procedures. Document results using "Hit/Miss" as in Table 1.2.(Note: Impacts exceeding AFI 11-2B-1V1 hit criteria will be documented as a "Miss.") 6AFI11-2B-1V2   13 JUNE 2008Table 1.2.  Weapons Employment Grades. Weapons employment grades were: LASD HASD *Miss Miss *FE Assessed GD *Hit DD Miss SD *Miss 1.6.2.  FE Judgment. FEs will apply judgment when determining the weapons employment grade.FEs will not consider WSO performance as less than qualified based solely on unreliable/substandardscores. FEs may override substandard weapons scores when weapon delivery procedures are satisfac-tory. Conversely, if the evaluatee uses marginal or unacceptable procedures, the FE will grade accord-ingly regardless of scores. The FE will include justification for such an award in the AdditionalComments Section of the AF Form 8. 1.7.  Examinations:  1.7.1.  Emergency Procedures Examination (Closed Book):  1.7.1.1.  General Knowledge. This exam consists of a minimum of 20 questions and includesinformation applicable to the individual's crew position and the unit's mission. Units may increasethe number of questions to provide an in-depth evaluation of the examinee's knowledge. 1.7.1.2.  Boldface. This exam will consist of written recitation of each boldface procedure appli-cable to the individual's specialty. Each answer must contain all critical action items in propersequence. Verbatim responses are not required; however, answers must clearly state the intendedcourse of action. 1.7.2.  Qualification Examination (Open Book). This examination will be derived from all flightmanuals and governing command directives. The exam will consist of at least 50 questions. Units mayincrease the number of questions to provide an in-depth evaluation of the examinee's knowledge. 1.7.2.1.  WSO exams will consist of questions applicable to both Offensive Systems Officer(OSO) and Defensive Systems Officer (DSO) positions. 1.8.  Instructor Evaluations:  1.8.1.  An instructor on a SPOT, RQ, or periodic evaluation who receives an area grade of U or Q-with additional training in any area will receive a QUAL grade of “Q3”. 1.8.1.1.  An individual on an INIT INSTR evaluation receiving an area grade of U or Q- with addi-tional training in any area will receive an INSTR grade of “3”. QUAL, INSTM or MSN may begraded “1”, “2” or “3” accordingly. 1.8.2.  An instructor receiving an area grade of U or Q- with additional training in any grading areawill not perform instructor duties until additional training is complete. The FE will check the “Restric-tions” block and annotate the restriction on the back of the AF Form 8 1.9.  Records Disposition. Dispose of records IAW AFI 33-364, Records Disposition – Procedures andResponsibilities.  AFI11-2B-1V2   13 JUNE 20087Chapter 2  EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS 2.1.  General. Evaluation requirements are depicted in Table 2.1. and Table 2.2. All areas marked withan “R” are required and must be accomplished. 2.1.1.  Mission Data. If using pre-planned products, the evaluatee is responsible for ensuring the databriefed and used in the aircraft is accurate and effective for mission accomplishment. 2.1.2.  Currency of Flight Publications. During all evaluations, FEs will evaluate all required T.O.sand in-flight publications for currency and accuracy IAW AFI 11-202V2 and AFI 11-215, USAFFlight Manuals Program. Units may specify additional publications to be evaluated in the unit supple-ment to AFI 11-202V2. 2.2.  Instrument/Qualification Evaluations. Pilot instrument, pilot qualification, WSO qualification,and instructor evaluations are generally flown in conjunction with MSN evaluations for efficiency. How-ever, each evaluation type may be administered on any compatible training mission with the approval ofthe Chief of Stan/Eval and the commander's concurrence. 2.2.1.  Pilot Instrument Requirements. The requirements for completion of the pilot instrumentevaluation are delineated in Table 2.1. with specific area evaluation criteria in Chapter 3. 2.2.2.  Pilot Qualification Requirements. In addition to the requirements delineated in Table 2.1.and specific area evaluation criteria in Chapter 3, the following applies: 2.2.2.1.  Emergency Traffic Patterns/Approaches/Landings . FTU and FIC maneuver qualifiedinstructors may either accomplish a No Flap/Slat Touch and Go in flight or a SimulatedTwo-Engine Out Approach/Go-Around in flight or in the simulator. (Note. Ref Table 2.1. Areas21 and 22). All other pilots are required to accomplish a No Flap/Slat Touch and Go in flight. 2.2.2.1.1.  For FTU/FIC qualified instructors, the WST may be used to complete this portionof the evaluation provided an emergency traffic pattern was accomplished in flight during theprevious evaluation. The usage of the WST for a evaluation does not include emergency trafficpatterns flown during an EPE. 2.2.3.  WSO Qualification Requirements. WSO completion requirements are delineated in Table2.1. and Chapter 3. 2.3.  Mission Evaluation. Mission evaluation items are delineated in Table 2.1. with specific area evalu-ation criteria in Chapter 3. FEs will evaluate examinees at their highest qualification level. Evaluationsduring exercises or deployments, where permitted, are encouraged. (Note: BMC pilots and WSOs shouldonly be evaluated on those missions they routinely perform. Examinees will only be evaluated on thoseareas for which they are current and qualified.) 2.3.1.  Evaluation Profiles. Mission evaluations will reflect Designed Operational Capability (DOC)tasking scenarios. Mission evaluations will demonstrate the individual's ability to accomplish combattaskings to include special missions. Units will attempt to schedule actual weapon releases and forma-tion for mission evaluations however single ship sorties may be used if necessary. 8AFI11-2B-1V2   13 JUNE 20082.3.2.  Weapons Employment. Any bomb run, actual or simulated, satisfies this requirement. Allplanned/attempted releases will be evaluated. Degraded delivery procedures can meet the require-ments of the evaluation. 2.3.3.  Electronic Warfare Mission Evaluation Requirements. Accomplish requirements delin-eated in Table 2.1., column 6. Squadrons will schedule at least one defensive action electronic attack(EA) event. The run should be scheduled against a Multiple Threat Emissions Systems (MUTES)capable site, simulators, emulators, or actual EA assets. Threat scenarios should represent unit task-ings. If the scheduled activity is attempted and not flown to completion due to circumstances beyondthe aircrew's control, the requirements of this paragraph may be satisfied by accomplishing any por-tion of an EA run if the FE observes sufficient activity. 2.4.  Offensive Systems Officer (OSO)/Defensive Systems Officer (DSO) only. Individuals qualifiedas OSO only will use Table 2.1. columns 4 and 5. DSO only qualified individuals will use Table 2.1. col-umns 4 and 6 2.5.  Instructor Evaluation. Flight evaluations will include a thorough evaluation of the examinee'sinstructor knowledge and ability. Instructors are required to demonstrate instructor ability on all evalua-tions. For evaluations conducted in flight or the WST, the examinee will conduct a student critique fol-lowing the crew debrief. Evaluators will provide the examinee a performance critique following thestudent critique. 2.5.1.  For evaluations not accomplished in conjunction with an INSTM/QUAL/MSN evaluation, theexaminee will brief, instruct, and debrief a flight or WST profile representative of the unit’s mission.(Note: Do not accomplish Instructor Pilot evaluations in the WST.) 2.5.2.  For scheduled instructor evaluations, the evaluator may require the examinee to present verbalexplanations of equipment operations and procedures pertinent to crew duties and responsibilities.Special demonstrations or instruction requested by the evaluator should not interfere with normal mis-sion accomplishment. Evaluators will provide sufficient time for the instructor to prepare for critiques. 2.5.3.  Instructor Pilot Evaluations. All initial and recurring instructor pilot evaluations may beadministered in conjunction with INSTM/QUAL/MSN evaluations. Except for the requirementsdelineated in Table 2.1., specific profiles and/or events will be determined by the FE. 2.5.4.  Instructor WSO Evaluations. All initial and recurring instructor WSO evaluations may beadministered in conjunction with QUAL/MSN evaluations. The initial Instructor WSO evaluationmay be conducted in flight or in the WST. The instructor examinee must demonstrate instructor abili-ties in both the OSO and DSO positions. As a minimum, the scheduled profile will include bombingand EA. If qualified as an OSO or DSO only, the examinee will perform duties for the respective posi-tion being evaluated. AFI11-2B-1V2   13 JUNE 20089Table 2.1.
