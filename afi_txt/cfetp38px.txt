Purpose. The 38P CFETP provides a development strategy for the Career Field Manager (CFM), commanders, training managers, supervisors, and trainers to plan, develop, manage, and conduct 38P education and training.  The outcome of this development strategy is to produce 38Ps capable of delivering Force Support capabilities across the AF and Joint environment at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels.  In addition, 38Ps should be developed to provide sound advice on Airmen and family issues to AF and DoD leadership.  In sum, this plan outlines the purposeful execution of education, training, and experience opportunities to ensure successful development of 38Ps into proficient managers of human capital assets.  1.1.  Commanders and supervisors must take an active role in an officer’s professional development by providing mentoring and career planning.  Officers should review career goals with their commander and supervisor or senior 38P officer during frequent mentoring sessions and performance feedback sessions.  They should discuss career development and progression using the 38P Officer Education and Training Roadmap in Figure D and the 38P Experience Pyramid in Figure E.  2.  Use. All 38Ps will complete the foundational education and training requirements in their appropriate stage of development as specified in this plan.    3.  Coordination and Approval. The Deputy Chief of Staff, Manpower, Personnel and Services is the approval authority for this CFETP.  The Ira C. Eaker Center, USAF Personnel Professional Development School (USAF PPDS) and 335th Training Squadron personnel will identify and coordinate on the career field training requirements.  The 38P CFM will initiate reviews of this document to ensure currency and accuracy.    Section B – Force Support (FS) Enduring Principles For 38Ps to develop appropriately they must understand the Human Capital Lifecycle, Combat Support (CS) Core Processes and CS Capabilities, FS Capabilities, and KSAs.  1.  Introduction to FS Enduring Principles. FS shapes the manner in which Airmen are postured, employed, sustained, and recovered in order to support the Air Force’s mission.  It defines requirements, acquires and develops specific skills, postures them into an organizational and individual utilization strategy, sustains them for combat operations, and finally transitions them back to home station operations.  FS provides unique capabilities for CS.  FS is, by design, not self-sustaining; it depends upon other CS Capabilities for security, health, and infrastructure support.  FS is an integral part of the structure employed to open, establish, and operate air bases worldwide and subsequently redeploy forces to their home installations.  It is an enabler by delivering agile, responsive, and efficient approaches to deliver combat Airmen to any theater or environment.  In order to accomplish this mission-set effectively, 38Ps must understand the Human Capital Lifecycle and FS Capabilities.  1.1.  Human Capital Lifecycle (HCL).  HCL is the way FS defines, shapes, develops, sustains, and delivers Airman capability to the Total Force.  Different versions of this lifecycle have  7 Figure A. HCL Lifecycle appeared in many forms over the years (see Figure A).  All aspects of this lifecycle are interdependent, each influencing the other in some way.  Capable Airmen do not just happen: they are the end result of this complex and purposeful process that accounts for our human resources from the time they are recruited to the time they separate or retire.  This lifecycle provides capable Airmen to the warfighter who globally project airpower.  It first appeared in the 1960’s and again in detail within USAF Personnel Plan 1, 1978.    1.1.1.  Define.  The lifecycle begins by determining and defining what the force requirements are in terms of abilities and skill sets for the Air Force.  This involves thorough identification of the current state of our workforce, what gaps exist within that workforce, and future force requirements.  This examination is the foundation in determining the needs for balancing and shaping the force to meet current and future demands.    1.1.2.  Shaping.  As the Air Force evolves, changes in requirements create inventory imbalances in affected career fields.  The Air Force has a variety of tools available to correct these imbalances and shape the force as necessary.  These tools include recruiting, enlisting, commissioning, hiring, retaining, formal crossflow programs, reclassifying, etc.  Together these programs help address career field manning imbalances with institutionalized methodologies to shape the officer, enlisted and civilian force within authorized, funded end-strength.  Additionally, Airmen are provided the initial skills and level of competence to be productive and then continuously trained and development throughout their careers.     1.1.3.  Develop.  As Airmen progress, emphasis is placed on enhancing capabilities through numerous educational and training opportunities.  This is where deliberate development shapes Airmen through a continuous learning environment to prepare them to be effective leaders and followers.  It uses a combination of developmental education, skills training, and work experiences to mold Airmen into dynamic contributors in any environment or battlefront.    1.1.4.  Sustainment.  FS provides continued efforts to meet the psychosocial, physical, and economic needs of Air Force personnel and their dependents.  Functions included (but not limited to) in this phase are feeding, sheltering, evaluating, promoting, regenerating, compensating, recognizing, and motivating.    1.1.5.  Deliver.  This is where Airmen are contributing to the Air Force mission.  It effectively classifies Airmen and assigns them to organizations where their required skills are utilized.    1.1.6.  Airman Capability.  This lifecycle produces an Airman capable to support our national security objectives.  This is where FS operates and applies its capabilities to provide (in expeditionary and peacetime environments) combat Airmen for Air Force missions.    2.  Combat Support (CS) Doctrine.  In order to fully understand how FS Capabilities support the Air Force mission, it is critical to grasp where they fit into the Combat Support role.  CS includes Core Effects, CS Core Processes, and CS Core Capabilities.  CS contains multiple functional communities that uniquely contribute to the readiness of the most important asset the Air Force has  8 – its Airmen, the common denominator in projecting global combat power.  CS does this by delivering the effects necessary to ensure every Airman is mission-ready.  A Readied Force A Prepared Operational Environment A Positioned Force Readying the Force Preparing the Operational Environment Positioning the Force Field Forces Base Forces Posture Responsive Forces CORE EFFECTS CORE PROCESSES CORE CAPABILITIES An Employed Force A Sustained Force A Reconstituted Force Employing the Force Sustaining and Recovering the Force Reconstituting the Force Protect Forces Generate the Mission Support the Mission, Forces, and Infrastructure   Sustain the Mission, Forces, and Infrastructure      FUNCTIONAL COMMUNITIES Airfield Operations Analyses, Assessments, and Lessons Learned Chaplain Corps Civil Engineer Force Support Financial Mgmt/Comptroller Health Services Judge Advocate Logistics Planning Materiel Management Munitions Mgmt Postal Services Public AffairsSafety Science/TechnologySecurity Forces Test and EvaluationWeather ServicesFigure B. Combat Support Doctrine    2.1.  CS Core Processes.  These processes are the standardized, overarching macro procedures using core capabilities to produce CS effects.  These macro procedures are the primary means of arranging CS practices due to their cyclical nature.  The six CS Core Processes are: Readying the Force, Preparing the Operational Environment, Positioning the Force, Employing the Force, Sustaining and Recovering the Force, and Reconstituting the Force.     9 2.2.  CS Core Capabilities.  Include Field Forces, Base Forces, Posture Responsive Forces, Protect Forces, Generate the Mission, Support the Mission/Forces/Infrastructure, and Sustain the Mission/Forces/Infrastructure.  A more detailed description of each is located in Annex 4-0, Combat Support.  Each FS Capability directly supports one or more CS Capabilities.  2.2.1.  CS Capabilities result from the proper employment and integration of all functional communities within the CS construct.  As part of this interdependent construct, FS contributes to executing CS processes and capabilities by delivering numerous roles within the CS construct (see Annex 4-0, Combat Support, Appendix: Functional Communities).    3.  Force Support Capabilities.  38Ps must be deliberately developed to apply their skills in an operational environment and articulate, in operational terms, how FS Capabilities impact CS and affects the Air Force mission.  Understanding the following list of capabilities along with their master processes and effects is the first step in 38P development.  FS has separate and distinct capabilities in order to accomplish the roles that enable CS to deliver its total capabilities.  Each capability is delivered through activities, programs or both to achieve the desired effect.  Some activities or programs may support more than one capability.  There are a total of 17 total FS Capabilities.  Two capabilities (3.1 and 3.2) produce effects within the Air Force enterprise as a whole on the macro level.  The remaining 15 Combat Effects capabilities produce operational and tactical - Right Number of       effects.    3.1.  Shaping and Balancing the Force.   Shaping and balancing the force is accomplished by analyzing the needs of the Air Force, providing the necessary capabilities, and retaining or transitioning Airmen according to the needs of the Air Force.  Leveraging technology and other innovations are necessary to support our evolving human resource management, compensation, and total force policies.  Properly executing this capability keeps the human capital requirement at the appropriate strength to accomplish the AF’s current and future missions.  It includes recruiting, retraining, reorganizing, and force shaping/sizing activities to place the right amount of combat Airmen where they are needed.  The right balance of these activities must be properly applied in the Regular Air Force (RegAF), Air National Guard (ANG), and the Air Force Reserve (AFR) as particular needs may vary.  CS Capabilities supported are: Field Forces, Base Forces, and Support the Mission, Forces, and Infrastructure.   3.2.  Force Development.  “Force development is a deliberate process of preparing Airmen through the continuum of learning with the required competencies to meet the challenges of the 21st Century” (Annex 1-1, Force Development).  Force development is both an individual and institutional responsibility.  The force development continuum focuses on developing Airmen to thoroughly understand the Air Force mission, organization, and doctrine.  It consists of three principle areas (training, education, and experience).  Force Development works to foster critical thinking, encourage exploration, and Master Processes - Recruit - Train - Educate  - Assign - Promote - Retain  - Transition  Master Processes - Analyze - Balance - Retain   - Transition  Airmen, Right AFSCs  - Retain the Right Airmen with the Right Skills and Experience  Requirements/ Targets Combat Effects - Mission Accomplishment: Skills/Leadership  - Build Future Force - Meet Manpower    10 Org Structure    Combat Effects - Valid/Defendable Requirements - Balanced Net Worth  - Funded Target  - Consistent, Efficient Master Processes - Define - Model - Validate  - Record - Program - Analyze  - Structure  creative problem-solving.  This capability provides a structured skill set to Airmen to be confident and competent in any scenario at the tactical, operational, or strategic level.  Additionally, it involves development through assignments, promotions, retention and transition programs by providing reference and information resources (i.e., Transition Assistance).  CS Capabilities supported are: Field Forces and Support the Mission, Forces, and Infrastructure.  3.3.  Manpower and Organization.  Commanders are provided the manpower and organization tools necessary to effectively and efficiently use their manpower resources.  As this capability projects outward, it provides services such as establishing organizational structure and requirements of locations as determined by the Commander, Air Force Forces (COMAFFORs).  Additionally, manpower and organization actions can activate, inactivate, or redesignate a unit, or enable a unit to vary from a standard organizational structure.  It systematically identifies minimum and essential manpower required for the most effective and economical accomplishment of assigned missions and functions within organizational and resource constraints.  CS Capabilities supported are: Field Forces, Base Forces, Posture Responsive Forces, and Support the Mission, Forces, and Infrastructure.  3.4.  Personnel Readiness and Accountability.  Foremost, this capability builds a system which ensures personnel are eligible to deploy, prepared for deployment, and properly accounted for during deployment.  It involves the tracking of every Airman, whether at home station or in a deployed location, giving commanders across the entire force knowledge of what type and how many people are under their control.  Personnel Readiness ensures all Airmen and their families are ready for deployments. This requires not only personal readiness responsibilities such as financial, child care, etc., but supportive programs for single Airmen, single parents, and families to better prepare and mitigate potential adversity.  CS Capabilities supported are: Field Forces, Base Forces, Posture Responsive Forces, Protect Forces, Generate the Mission, Support the Mission, Forces, and Infrastructure, and Sustain the Mission, Forces, and Infrastructure.  3.5.  Feeding Operations.  Feeding operations procure, receive, inspect, store, sanitize, prepare, serve, and dispose of food items.  During beddown operations, forces are provided with meals ready to eat (MREs).  As operations progress, unitized group rations (UGRs) are prepared.  The final capability goal is to transition to hot meals using fresh and frozen food items or A-rations.  Food operations provides the fuel Airmen need to perform their Master Processes - Procure - Receive Inspect -- Store  - Sanitize - Prepare  - Serve - Waste Disposal  - Deploy/Receive In-process - - Store Data  - Analyze - Redeploy - Feed Airmen Weapon System  - Bolster Immune  - Higher Energy Systems - Planning Enabler - Effective Fighting  Force for JFC - JFC Command Responsibilities Enabler Levels - Feel Good - Low GI Rates  Combat Effects - Accurate Force/Skill Inventory Master Processes - Prepare Airmen & Families  Combat Effects  11 Systems - Safe Environment  - Clean Uniforms Combat Effects - Rest & Recuperate - Prevent Sleep Deprivation - High Energy Levels  - Support Immune Master Processes - House - Run Locator - Supply Occupants - Procure/Store Linens  - NAF Resale - Laundry  combat missions.  Every mission requires a healthy and diverse choice of options, despite the location or the hardships involved.  CS Capabilities supported are: Protect the Forces, Generate the Mission, Support the Mission, Forces, and Infrastructure, and Sustain the Mission, Forces, and Infrastructure.  3.6.  Lodgment of Forces.  Lodging operations house personnel, supply furnishings and necessary items, provide a personnel locator, manage NAF resale, and provide laundry operations for Airmen.  It adapts available fixed facilities, erects tents, and/or procures contracts to provide housing for Airmen.  This capability provides an environment where Airmen can rest and regenerate to perform future missions.  By considering the rest factor, sanitation, fire, and ground safety, FS personnel can ensure successful sustainment of human resources in any environment or location.  Without proper rest, Airmen lose their effectiveness.  CS Capabilities supported are: Protect Forces, Generate the Mission, Support the Mission, Forces, and Infrastructure, and Sustain the Mission, Forces, and Infrastructure.  3.7.  Keeping Airmen Fit to Fight.  Fitness operations include designing exercise programs (directed and self-directed), procuring and maintaining equipment, enhancing mental and physical health, and creating healthy diversions from combat activities.  It adapts both outdoor/indoor facilities to provide opportunities to keep Airmen fit to fight.  It operates in all environments and locations to deliver mentally and physically capable Airmen across the full spectrum of military operations.  CS Capabilities supported are: Protect Forces, Generate the Mission, Support the Mission, Forces, and Infrastructure, and Sustain the Mission, Forces, and Infrastructure.  3.8.  Casualty and Mortuary Affairs. Casualty provides notification to leadership and family members of service-members that have been ill, injured, deceased or have been wounded or killed in action. Mortuary operates under extreme conditions to identify, track deceased personnel, and care for the remains of fallen personnel.  Mortuary will care for and arrange the shipment of our fallen Airmen to their families with the dignity and respect they deserve.  CS Capability supported is: Support the Mission, Forces, and Infrastructure.  Master Processes - Report - Notification - Collect - Recover  - Store - Prepare - Ship - Waste Disposal  - Honors  Combat Effects - Mental & Physical Health Maintenance - Strengthen Immune  - High Energy Levels  - Stress Relief - Effective Job Performance Master Processes - Procure Equipment - Maintain Equipment - Design Exercise  Programs (Directed and Self-Directed) - No One Left Behind  Combat Effects - Dignity and Respect for Airmen & Families    Systems  - Sanitize    12 Mediums  Combat Effects - Healthy Diversions - Relief of Family  - Decompression  - Low Discipline Rates Separation Anxiety Master Processes - Connectivity - Library - Professional  Development    Master Processes - Programs (Directed and Self-Directed) - Market/Advertise  - Entertainment  - Procure/Store/Display - Use of Multiple 3.9.  Airmen Regeneration.  Airmen Regeneration procures entertainment and creates alternative diversions from work stress and family separation anxiety by allowing for decompression and regeneration of Airmen.  This capability is provided through multiple mediums (virtual, tactile, creative, developmental) and programs (directed and self-directed).  Airmen Regeneration efforts begin once the base is open for operations, providing diversion from the hardships and family separations our Airmen must endure.  This capability is very difficult to perform in a deployed environment and requires great creativity and marketing efforts to make it successful.  When developing programs, consider diverse interests as well as events for both recurring and special occasions.  CS Capabilities supported are: Protect Forces, Support the Mission, Forces, and Infrastructure, and Sustain the Mission, Forces, and Infrastructure.  3.10.  Developing and Connecting Airmen to the Outside World.  Developing and Connecting Airmen to the Outside World delivers intellectual pursuits for both continued professional development, as well as mental diversions from the daily realities faced during combat duty.  This capability connects Airmen and their families, facilitates professional military education, and provides recreational reading.  It supports Airmen by delivering both digital and hard copy access (when available) to various media.  The end effects are Airmen who continue their professional and self-development efforts.  CS Capability supported is: Support the Mission, Forces, and Infrastructure.  3.11.  Alternative Resource Sourcing.  Alternative Resource Sourcing provides the ability to capitalize on various financial resources and NAF and Appropriated Fund (APF) contracts, commercial sponsorship, private organizations, partnerships in alternate resourcing and NAF memorandums of agreement.  These different resources provide alternative options to achieve commanders’ objectives.  These alternative resources enable FS to offer programs, maintain service standards, consistent program execution, and provide backfill options during crisis or contingency deployments.  CS Capability supported is: Support the Mission, Forces, and Infrastructure.     - Maintain Service  - Capability Execution Levels - Relief from Family  Separation Anxiety and Stress - Continued Personal Validation  - Budgeting   - Coordination  - Contract Management Master Processes - Requirements Combat Effects - Right Resources at the Right Time and Professional Development  Combat Effects - Healthy Mental Diversions     - T-MOAs   13 DV Visits  Combat Effects - Facilitate Successful - Enable Networking at  - Positive Showing of Senior Levels Boss’ Hospitality  - Consistent Standards Master Processes - Programs (Directed and Self-Directed) - Budget   - Obtain Sponsorship - Market/Advertise - Family & Team Building Activities Combat Effects - Focus on Mission  - Esprit de Corps - Individual & Family Comfort Knowledge of Support Systems - Sense of Belonging Master Processes - Plan  - Schedule - Coordinate  - Conduct  - Budget  3.12.  Hosting Official Functions.  Hosting Official Functions includes planning, scheduling, coordinating, and conducting distinguished visitor (DV) events with Airmen and visits to base senior leaders.  It develops plans, procedures and budgets to cover special events, meetings, and entertainment where DVs are involved.  It facilitates both visits to the Airmen and visits to base senior leadership.  Additionally, this capability ensures a synergy and economy of force by avoiding conflicts in the use of NAFs and APFs, contingency funds, special representation funds, and special morale and welfare funds.  CS Capability supported is: Support the Mission, Forces, and Infrastructure.  3.13.  Building a Sense of Community.  Building a Sense of Community strengthens relationships through programs that develop Airmen, civilians, dependents, and retirees by promoting individual development and family unity.  This is accomplished by providing physical and mental stimulation in a societal environment designed to support the unique needs of military members and associated family members.  Community building is accomplished through directed and self-directed activities, budgeting, sponsorship, marketing, advertising, hosting official and unofficial functions, family and team building activities.  This enables Airmen to focus on the mission by providing peace of mind in the knowledge that families at home station have access to support systems that meet their needs.  CS Capability supported is: Support the Mission, Forces, and Infrastructure.  3.14.  Infant to Teenager Development.  Infant to Teenager Development offers available, affordable, quality child care and youth development programs that are a workforce enabler.  These programs generate a sense of well-being that family members are well cared for in a quality environment, thus enabling Airmen to clearly focus on training and mission accomplishment. This capability provides multiple avenues for infant through teenager care and development (i.e. child development centers, family child care homes, school age care programs, youth programs, Exceptional Family Member Program (EFMP) respite care, community-based programs/partnerships).  Properly employing this capability reduces the stress of families who have the primary responsibility for the health, safety and well-being of their children and helps them balance the competing demands of family life and the Air Force mission.  The end result is a mission-focused Airman whose family has the skills to thrive in a military environment.  CS Capability supported is: Support the Mission, Forces, and Infrastructure.  Master Processes - Nurture - Environment Exploration Children & Teens - Positive Interaction in Military & Family  Environments Combat Effects - Well-Adjusted - Feed  - Safe/Secure/Healthy Locations - Train  - Registration/Fees     14 Coordination  Combat Effects - Prevention of Family Violence - Reduce Suicidal  - Offset Post-Event Ideations Combat Effects Depression & Maladjustment  Increased Retention Master Processes - Program  - Budget - Sponsorship - Market/Advertise  - Outside Agency Master Processes - Awareness - Prevention - Training  - Victim Advocacy - Outreach  - Risk Reduction  3.15.  Airmen and Family Reunification.   Airmen and Family Reunification provides opportunities for healthy reunions after remote tours and deployments.  The expeditionary nature of the Air Force necessitates the orchestration of reuniting Airmen with their families and units to mitigate post-event depression, maladjustment, suicidal ideations, family violence, and other negative impacts.  FS, through existing and targeted special programming, concentrate resources to create positive outcomes in the reuniting process.  Special effort may be required to build community between Air Reserve Component (ARC) families who may not have the same unit connectedness as RegAF families.  Additionally, wounded, ill and injured (WII) warriors and their families are provided valuable non-medical care to assist in their recovery/rehabilitation.  CS Capability supported is: Support the Mission, Forces, and Infrastructure.      3.16.  Prevent and Respond to Sexual Assault.  This capability provides direction, planning, and management for installation-wide sexual assault prevention and response programs.  This encompasses creating awareness, sexual violence prevention, and outreach.  It also provides assistance to victims through advocacy programs and coordination of services such as medical treatment, mental health support and legal services.  CS Capability supported is: Support the Mission, Forces, and Infrastructure.  3.17.  Prevent and Respond to Equal  Opportunity issues.  This capability provides direction, planning, and management for installation-wide equal opportunity (EO) programs impacting all Airmen (military and civilian).  This encompasses creating awareness, reduction of associated risks, and outreach.  In addition, it includes training for individuals and organizational leadership.  CS Capability supported is: Support the Mission, Forces, and Infrastructure.  4.  FS Critical Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities (KSAs).  4.1.  Knowledge is defined as a cognizance of facts, truths, and principles.  Application and sharing of one's knowledge base is critical to individual and organizational success.  A skill is a developed proficiency or dexterity in mental operations or physical processes that is often acquired through specialized education and training; the execution of these skills result in effective performance. Ability is the power or aptitude to perform physical or mental activities that are often affiliated with a particular profession.   4.2.  38Ps should strive to develop and master the following critical eight KSAs which span the Master Processes - Awareness - Prevention  - Training - Outreach  - Risk Reduction  - Mutual Trust & Responsibility  - Camaraderie  - Fairness - Discipline  - Accountability - Trust  - Camaraderie  - Fairness - Discipline  -   Combat Effects  15 entire community.  The following KSAs are essential for the effective delivery of FS Capabilities to the CS structure: Advisor Skills, Analysis/Continuous Process Improvement (CPI), Creative Thinking, Critical Thinking, Customer Service, Future Thinking, Project Management, and Performance Measurement.  4.3.  Advisor Skills (Organizational).  AF/A1 provides critical personnel advice to our military, DoD, and elected leadership. That advice is based on staff work, and the multiple skill sets and experiences of those that advise the AF/A1 staff. The AF/A1 staff receives advice from the MAJCOMs and field.  Even the best advice may not be taken if the source is perceived as not being credible.  Credibility is earned through consistent delivery of accurate, well-thought out, and disciplined provided at the right time and place.  4.3.1.  Advisor Skills (Individual).  A 38P leader who develops good advisor skills is better able to influence superiors, peers, and subordinates in the decision-making process.  Once credibility and trust is built with those he/she works with, a 38P will become the “go to” person leadership relies on for sound recommendations.  If your boss comes to you and asks you what you think…you are on the right track.

Topics include:  Six Sigma, LEAN, Organizational Analysis, Basic Statistical Concepts, Auditing, Problem Solving, and Continuous Process Improvement.  4.4.1.  Analysis/CPI (Individual).  This skill helps you select the right data and facts to ensure you are making well-informed decisions before implementing new programs or changes. A common issue many 38P leaders will deal with is adjusting hours of operation.  Asking your team for the right data such as usage rates and operating costs per hour will help you determine the most effective hours of operation and provide justification for your change.        16 ANALYSIS/CPI DEFINITION  To analyze is to examine data and facts to uncover and understand cause-effect relationships, thus providing basis for problem solving and decision making.  A constant process by which processes and activities are continually evaluated and improved to meet current and future demands.

Synthesizes requirements for and implements and assesses improvement efforts utilizing sound approaches to manage and minimize complexity, paradoxes, risks and contradictions and their impact on improvement initiatives.  4.5.  Creative Thinking (Organizational).  In an era of decreasing resources, we must find creative solutions to deliver and improve personnel programs and services.  A1 programs and activities directly contribute to Air Force quality of life, readiness and resiliency.  Creative thinking skills are required to evaluate and develop new and improved ways to support our Air Force family.  4.5.1.  Creative Thinking (Individual).  As a 38P, you will be required to find answers and solutions not always found in AFIs or checklists.  To be successful in this career field you will need to use innovation, ingenuity, and imagination to work through issues that are not clearly defined.  As a leader you will be expected to find solutions to problems, like maintaining services during a deployment cycle when your unit is 50% manned.  CREATIVE THINKING DEFINITION Creative thinking is a way of looking at problems or situations from a fresh perspective that suggests unorthodox solutions or innovation.  Creative thinking can be stimulated both by a loosely structured process such as brainstorming, and by a more rigid, structured process such as lateral thinking.

Critical Thinking (Organizational).  The 38P community is responsible for implementing Air Force-wide personnel programs and manning solutions.  Many initiatives have service-wide impact and require detailed analysis and disciplined reasoning prior to implementation.  Even then, these initiatives can result in unforeseen second and third order effects.  Critical thinking skills allow the 38P community to ask the right questions, provide well-reasoned Air Force solutions, and anticipate consequences so they can be taken into account prior to implementation.  Senior 38Ps  17 will be involved in Air Force-wide personnel solutions and must possess disciplined reasoning skills to arrive at optimum enterprise solutions.    4.6.1.  Critical Thinking (Individual).  Critical thinking starts with the individual. It is a skill that, when practiced, allows people to make informed decisions by using logical, well-reasoned thinking.  38Ps will be leading large organizations and are often assigned to positions where they do not possess all the background/knowledge to be experts in their domain.  This limitation can be overcome by knowing the right questions to ask, who to ask, and using a disciplined thought process prior to making decisions.  CRITICAL THINKING DEFINITION Critical thinking is the art of analyzing and evaluating thinking with a view to improving it.  It is self-directed, self-disciplined, self-monitored and self-corrective thinking.

The A1 community has an arduous task: to continually support and take care of people at home and abroad.  Policies and processes should be developed with an approach that fosters an environment where customers feel positive and confident about the service received and the organization providing it.  Creating a customer service culture across the A1 portfolio is accomplished by keeping the customer and their perspective in mind in all we do.  4.7.1.  Customer Service (Individual).  A customer service focus helps you understand the relationship you and your team has with the customer in order to anticipate customer needs and adjust services accordingly.  Good customer service promotes repeat business and can mean the difference between an activity meeting financial goals or going out of business.  You can be that one person that gives that customer a positive impression of your activity and/or organization.   CUSTOMER SERVICE DEFINITION To provide customer service is the ability to provide a service or product in the way that it has been promised; Customer service is about treating others as you would like to be treated yourself; It is an organization's ability to supply their customers' wants and needs.

ADVANCED  Creates a shared vision that describes a future state.  Anticipates, formulates, and evaluates solutions to threats and opportunities impacting vision and mission accomplishment. Compares, evaluates, and approves new ideas based on organizational strategy and vision. 4.8.  Future Thinking (Organizational).  When implementing enterprise solutions and personnel policy, the A1 community should ensure polices are sustainable and congruent with long-term Air Force objectives.  For example, a 38P leader working changes to the overall end strength must understand what the future missions will be, what jobs will be required, and how much the personnel needed for those additional positions will cost over the years and into retirement.    4.8.1.  Future Thinking (Individual).  Future thinkers are able to predict changes in the environment and spend more time driving change vice reacting to change.  Future thinking allows FS leaders to look beyond today’s roadblocks and plan for an uncertain future.  Future thinking drives technology and resource priorities.  Individuals with this skill can better dictate mission tempo and focus efforts or resources to shape a new path for themselves and their units.  In other words, be visionary.  DESCRIPTIVE BEHAVIOR COMPETENCIES  4.9.  Performance Measurement (Organizational).  Measurements/metrics are critical in determining an organization’s health.  Many officers are proficient in measuring individual performance; however, they struggle to find answers when asked how well an organization is doing. The first step is to set expectations and then design methods to monitor results.  Determining the right data to collect will provide a solid measurement of your organization.  Whether it is the Air Force or a Force Support Squadron, organizational performance can and should be measured.   4.9.1.  Performance Measurement (Individual).  How do you know how well you are doing?  What about your subordinates?  Individual performance measurements are more common and come in the form of feedback, OPRs, awards, etc.  However, 38Ps should not simply rely on those formal mechanisms.  Developing yourself and those working for you requires a more in-depth look.  Like organizational measurement, it starts with setting expectations for yourself and those around you.          19 PERFORMANCE MEASURMENT DEFINITION The ongoing monitoring and reporting of program accomplishments, particularly progress towards pre-established goals.  Performance measures may address the type or level of program activities conducted (process), the direct products and services delivered by a program (outputs), and/or the results of those products and services (outcomes).  A “program” may be any activity, project, function, or policy that has an identifiable purpose.

Project Management (Organizational).  An organization which practices solid project management is able to plan, prioritize resources, organize, and complete projects across the enterprise on time and on schedule.  Disciplined project management is required to manage Air Force level programs.    4.10.1.  Project Management (Individual).  38Ps are often tasked with managing projects.  A 38P leader needs to learn and implement project management tools to successfully complete initiatives while effectively leading teams.  Everyday projects such as the deployment processing line, or the more complex projects like reorganization of manpower on the base, require project management skills to be successful  DESCRIPTIVE BEHAVIOR COMPETENCIES PROJECT MANAGEMENT DEFINITION Project management is the body of knowledge concerned with principles, techniques, and tools used in planning, control, monitoring, and review of projects.

The CoL is the deliberate process of combining education, training, and experience to produce the right expertise and competence to meet the Air Force’s operational needs is the key element of developing an Airman. (Annex 1-1, Force Development).    1.1.  Education, training, and experience are the components of the CoL. These complementary aspects of force development are essential in tailoring the right development for the right person at the right time.  This is an ongoing process and is continuously being examined for new needs.  Education and training represent a large investment of resources and are the primary tools in developing Airmen for leadership levels.  Education, training, and experience are distinct but related force development activities.   1.2.  Education. Provides critical thinking skills, encourages exploration into unknown areas, and promotes creative problem solving.  Its greatest benefit comes in unknown situations or new challenges; education prepares the individual for unpredictable scenarios.   1.3.  Training.  Is focused on a structured skill set, and the results of training performance should be consistent.  Thus, training provides the individual with skill expertise.  Education and training together provide the tools for developing Airmen.   1.4.  Experience. The continuously growing part of any Airman’s career is where the synthesis of education and training occurs.   1.5.  The Air Force believes in learning across the continuum of an Airman’s career beginning with the knowledge obtained from accession sources and continuing throughout a career.  Through the CoL, the Air Force exposes Airmen to a broad-based education, training, and experience framework that equips them with the competencies to serve as leaders as they progress in rank and responsibility.    2.  Force Support Education.  Professional development is more than just assignments.  The completion of professional continuing education (PCE), foundational and job-specific courses, professional military education (PME), and relevant advanced academic degrees facilitate professional development.   2.1.  FS PCE Objectives.  The objective of PCE is to equip students with the tools, techniques, and theories necessary to think critically, be creative, measure performance, analyze complex issues, and project visionary collaborative solutions.  PCE delivers systematic foundational education and job-specific courses that are current, relevant, and effective for our manpower, personnel, and services professionals.  PCE is key to developing multi-disciplined, critical-thinking leaders, and professionals who are warrior-scholars.    21                                                     Location: 335th Training Squadron Distance Learning Distance Learning Distance Learning USAF PPDS Distance Learning USAF PPDS USAF PPDS 2.2.

The Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced KSAs Courses are posted on this site. https://usafprod.skillport.com/skillportfe/main.action  3.4.  Home Station Readiness Training (HSRT).  Effective HSRT is critical to provide deployed commanders with fully-qualified Prime Readiness in Base Services (RIBS) team members capable of accomplishing the wide variety of FS deployed responsibilities.  Prime RIBS team members must be trained and ready for deployment to austere bare-base locations with limited or no facilities and transition to sustained operations.  HSRT should challenge Prime RIBS team members to improve their individual and UTC team capabilities for deployed operations.  HSRT consists of computer-based training enhancements, self-study guides, classroom education, hands-on equipment training, duty-specific training based on UTC assignment, and ancillary training such as weapons qualification, Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical warfare defense training, and Self-aid Buddy Care.  See AFI 10-214 Air Force Prime RIBS Program for specific requirements and training intervals.   3.5.  Deliberate and Crisis Action Planning and Execution Segments (DCAPES) (E3A2R35051 AA2B in-res / E7A2T35051 OA1B MTT).  All 38Ps serving in Installation Personnel Readiness (IPR) and those selected for specific deployment missions must complete a formal DCAPES course.  This course introduces wing/base-level DCAPES users to the knowledge and skills needed to manage deployment requirements.  This course provides introductory Global Command and Control System (GCCS) and DCAPES training, focusing on personnel deployments processes for installation contingency and exercise requirements.  Newsgroups and chat tools enhance the course, putting the user in direct contact with experts from MAJCOMs and the Air Force Personnel Center.  A comprehensive base exercise scenario practical exercise completes the training experience.  This course satisfies the formal training requirement for wing/base echelon personnel to hold DCAPES write permission.  The DCAPES Course is held at Keesler AFB, MS.   3.6.  Personnel in Support of Contingency Operations (PERSCO) Training.  38Ps will participate in PERSCO training to include in-house training IAW AFI 36-3802 Personnel Readiness Operations.    4.  38P Officer Education and Training Roadmap.  The roadmap details the foundational PCE courses that make up the educational continuum that 38Ps will participate in during their careers.  All courses may not apply to ANG and AFR 38P officers due to limited training allocations and course attendance challenges.  Job-specific PCE courses, training, PME, and AAD opportunities are also presented (see Figure D).    27  Figure D. 38P - Personnel Officer Education & Training Roadmap 28 5.  FS Experience.  In addition to foundational and job-specific education and training, experience plays an important role in development.  Successful senior officers build their careers one assignment at a time, always keeping in mind that their current assignment is the most important assignment for career progression.  Each assignment offers valuable experience to enhance breadth and develop depth.    5.1.  Experience Timeline.  38Ps should develop depth early in their career with appropriate assignments.  Subsequently, officers will gradually broaden their knowledge and experience baselines within and outside the personnel career field.  In order to develop depth in the initial four years, commanders and supervisors should keep officers in their assigned duties for no less than 12-18 months.  During the first 10 years, officers should develop a solid technical and operational experience in a broad range of FS capabilities supported by appropriate PCE, PME, and AAD.  38Ps should strive to complete leadership assignments in a least two flight commands within the FSS. We believe that the flight command experience provides significant tests in leadership, organization, and resource management further enhancing functional expertise across all FS KSAs.  5.2.  Core Assignments.  The majority of CGO 38P functional opportunities are in the FSS.  These assignments provide the deeper knowledge and experience across all the FS Capabilities and KSAs.  Joint, HAF, MAJCOM/A1, State Headquarters, Joint Force Headquarters (JFHQ), National Guard Bureau (NGB), and FOAs provide additional growth and broadening opportunities.     5.3.  Out of Core Assignments.  Out of core assignments include any assignment where the duty AFSC is  not 38P.  While out of core assignments are important growth opportunities, core assignments should take precedence in officer development and care must be taken to not allow out of core assignments to hinder an officers career progression.  An officers’ first two assignments should be focused on developing depth in FS Capabilities and KSAs.   5.4.  Deployments.  The experience gained with Air Force and joint deployment tours adds to an officers’ operational credibility and further enhances one’s understanding of FS KSAs.  The opportunities to work in austere environments will provide operational challenges requiring critical thinking and resourcefulness that will benefit future development.  5.5.  38P Experience Pyramid.  The following pyramid displays assignment opportunities available at different times in a 38P career.  Experiences may vary for ARC 38Ps.  The pyramid is only a guide and it cannot possibly represent every career path or road to success.  This pyramid should be used as a planning guide by senior leaders, mentors, commanders, supervisors, and individuals in conjunction with other planning tools, to include AFI 36-2110, Assignments.  Ultimately, an officer’s career path will be influenced by personal aspirations and Air Force needs. 29    Figure E. 38P Experience Pyramid  Section D – Proficiency Training and Experience Requirements  1.  Purpose. Proficiency training requirements in this career field are defined in terms of tasks and knowledge requirements.  This section outlines the specialty qualification requirements for entry, award, and retention of each Air Force Specialty level.      2.  Qualified Level (38P3).  For award of the 38P3 AFSC, completion of BPOC is mandatory. A waiver from the CFM is required if any portion of BPOC is not completed.  In addition, a minimum of 24 months of experience is mandatory. Within the 24 months of graduating BPOC, an officer must also complete the Follow-On Unit Training (FOUT), Basic KSA Course, and Basic Contingency Course.  All requirements must be certified by the FSS commander or senior career field leader assigned to the organization.  A waiver from the CFM is required if the FOUT or other tasks cannot be completed within the 24-month period. ANG and AFR personnel will coordinate waivers with their component CFM and the RegAF CFM.  3.  Staff Level (38P4).  Awarded based on position.  Officers must be appointed to a staff position at the Air Staff, MAJCOM, Numbered Air Force, Field Operating Agency, Direct Reporting Unit, State JFHQ, NGB, or Combatant Command to achieve the Staff Level 38P4 AFSC.  Section E – Resource Constraints  1.  Purpose. This section identifies known resource constraints that preclude optimal/desired education and  training from being developed or conducted.  30    2.  Constraints. 2.1.  Education Constraints.  PCE foundational courses will be either centrally funded under the Air Force Educational Requirements Board (AFERB) process, funded by AF/A1, or MAJCOM or unit funded.  Job-specific courses will be funded by the AFERB process, funded by AF/A1, or MAJCOM or unit funded.   2.2.  Training Constraints.  BPOC quotas are determined and funded based on annually projected new accessions and officer cross flows.  PART II Section A – Basic Personnel Officer Course, Course Training Standard (CTS)  1. Task, Knowledge, and Proficiency Level Requirements.  The tasks and corresponding training proficiency levels on the BPOC CTS (Annex A) were reviewed and validated during the January 2016 Specialty Training Requirements Team (STRT) and Utilization and Training Workshop (U&TW).  The qualitative requirements for each task are based on the proficiency values listed below.     2.  Records Documentation.  Upon completion of BPOC, students will receive a certificate of completion and a training report (AF Form 475, Education/Training Report).   Section B – Follow-On Unit Training (FOUT).  1.   Purpose.  FOUT is designed to teach new officers operating procedures, requirements, and common practices that will enhance knowledge already gained at BPOC. Officers must complete FOUT prior to being awarded the 38P3 skill level.     1.1.  Concept. The intent of FOUT is to provide officers with a more detailed, in-depth, and working knowledge  31 of A1 enduring principles and core competencies.  When used correctly as a tool to manage training for a 38P, it can significantly enhance the job knowledge and application of key tasks and processes.    1.2.  How to Use.  The FSS Commander or senior career field leader assigned will appoint the appropriate member to serve as the officer training manager.  This individual will track completion of the FOUT in Air Force Training Record (AFTR) (e.g. Operations Officer, UTM, or Staff Division Chief).  The officer training manager is encouraged to use task experts (i.e. Flight Commanders and SNCOs/NCOs) to conduct this training.  Recommended trainers are provided on the attached FOUT.  However, units may select other subject matter experts to conduct training, as long as they can validate the trainee understands the information and have successfully completed the corresponding task.  Upon completion of each training item, AFTR will be updated accordingly.  Each task is annotated as it applies to RegAF, AFR, and/or ANG 38Ps. For certain tasks there are separate and distinct requirements for AFR and ANG officers. In addition, there are specific tasks that are not mandated for AFR and/or ANG officers. These tasks are listed as “not required”.    1.3.  Flow of FOUT.  The FOUT is organized accordingly to the two enterprise FS Capabilities and 15 operational FS Capabilities (see paragraphs 3.1. and 3.3.).  1.4.  Implementation.  Each unit has a distinct ops tempo and will have to determine how and when to implement FOUT.  The officer training manager and trainee must work together to ensure all tasks are completed within 24 months of the trainee’s BPOC graduation.   1.5.  Certification.  Once the officer training manager confirms the trainee has achieved the required levels of understanding for all FOUT tasks and AFTR has been updated accordingly, he/she will track the completion of the other 38P3 level requirements (24 months of experience, Basic KSA Course, and Basic Contingency Course).  The officer training manager will notify the Squadron Commander or equivalent leader when all upgrade requirements have been completed, and ensure an AF Form 2096 Classification/On-The-Job Training Action is prepared for signature and processed.  1.6.  A Note to 38P Trainees.  While working through this plan take notes, ask lots of questions, and request clarification on any training item.  The FOUT includes guidance references to allow you to conduct research on the topic before and after your training sessions.  This is your plan, designed for and by other 38Ps to help increase your effectiveness.  Enjoy, learn, and network across your organization!                          32 Reference PSD Guide document Force Support Squadron Personnel Service, Delivery, Execution, Organization, and Responsibilities, 1A-3.3.1.
