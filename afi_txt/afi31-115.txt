Headquarters United States Air Force (HQ USAF).  HQ USAF/A7S determines how SF members conduct criminal investigations throughout the USAF. 1.2.  Headquarters  Air  Force  Office  of  Special  Investigations  (HQ  AFOSI).  HQ  AFOSI organizes,  trains  and  equips  its  field  units,  which  are  responsible  for  conducting  criminal investigations,  counterintelligence  activities  and  specialized  investigative  and  force  protection support  for  the  Air  Force.  HQ  AFOSI  also  develops  guidelines  concerning  the  division  of investigative responsibility within the USAF and manages the USAF’s Polygraph and Technical Services Programs 1.3.  Headquarters  Air  Force  Security  Forces  Center  (HQ  AFSFC).  HQ  AFSFC  provides installation DFC with guidance on investigative matters. 1.4.  Major  Command  (MAJCOM)  Security  Forces  (A7S).  Establishes  command  unique programs and policies to ensure the effective use of the SF Investigators and Department of the Air  Force  Civilian  Police  (DAF/CP)  Detectives  in  the  protection  of  command  installations, personnel and resources. 1.5.  Installation  Defense  Force  Commander.  The  DFC  will  establish  an  SF  Investigations Section (S2I) within their squadron to manage incidents and/or crimes as delineated in AFI 71-101, Volume I, Criminal Investigations Program. The AFOSI and Security Forces Investigative matrix  used  in  AFI  71-101,  volume  1,  is  a  guideline  to  determine  investigative  responsibility; however,  AFOSI  must  be  notified  immediately  concerning  all  incidents  falling  within  OSI’s investigative  purview  and  also  must  be  notified  when  S2I  initiates  a  criminal  investigation. AFOSI has the authority and independent discretion to assume investigative responsibility, join an S2I investigation or monitor the progress of an S2I investigation when it involves Air Force or DOD personnel, property or resources. The DFC should give consideration to having S2I report directly to him/her in order to prevent any possible conflict of interest with internal investigative processes.  The  title  Defense  Force  Commander  is  synonymous  with  Chief  of  Security  Forces (CSF) and Senior Anti-Terrorism Officer (ATO) may be used interchangeably. (T-0) 1.6.  Noncommissioned Officer in Charge (NCOIC) or Chief of Investigations, if civilian. 1.6.1.  Ensure  liaison  is  maintained  with  AFOSI  and  other  local  military  bases.  Coordinate with  federal,  state  and  local  civilian  police  agencies,  when  required.  Ensure  liaison  is  also maintained with  the installation’s legal  office.  It  is  recommended that  a  weekly meeting be established  among  SFS/S2I,  AFOSI  and  base  Legal  Offices to  discuss  ongoing investigations. (T-2) 1.6.2.  Coordinate with Security Forces Reports and Analysis (S5R) section and local AFOSI detachment to monitor any criminal trend analysis. (T-2) 1.6.3.  Review  daily  blotter  for  incidents  requiring  investigative  follow-up  outside  of  flight operations and assign cases to be investigated. (T-3) 1.6.4.  Ensure quarterly accountability has been conducted on stored evidence. (T-2)   6  AFI31-115  10 NOVEMBER 2014 1.6.5.  Review/sign the Report of Investigation (ROI). (T-2) 1.7.  Investigator or Detective, if civilian. 1.7.1.  Assist  in  immediate  dissemination  of  any  potentially  dangerous  or  pertinent information to squadron leadership that is received. (T-2) 1.7.2.

Off-duty DAFC Detectives who witness a crime occurring on base will only act within the provisions of their Core Performance Description (CPD). 1.8.  Joint Drug Enforcement Teams (JDET). 1.8.1.  AFOSI and SFS work jointly to establish JDETs. These teams cover drug enforcement and participation is at the discretion and agreement of the local DFC and local AFOSI field unit commander or Special Agent-in-Charge (SAIC). More information about this team can be found in Chapter 4 of this publication. AFI31-115  10 NOVEMBER 2014   7  Chapter 2 ESTABLISHING AN INVESTIGATIONS PROGRAM 2.1.  Investigative Jurisdiction.  SF members investigate all crimes, offenses or incidents falling within their investigative jurisdiction, both on/off the installation, as set forth in attachment 2 of AFI  71-101, volume  I. Some cases may involve  coordination with  federal,  local  or host nation law  enforcement  agencies/forces  to  complete  a  thorough  investigation.  SF  may  investigate matters normally falling within AFOSI’s jurisdiction IAW AFI 71-101, volume 1, only after the local AFOSI field unit commander/SAIC has declined to investigate. 2.1.1.  With  prior  coordination,  the  DFC  or  designated  representative  may  agree  to  work other cases with local AFOSI not listed under S2I in AFI 71-101, volume 1. If S2I initiates a case  and  it  is  later  determined  AFOSI  will  assume  responsibility  for  it,  S2I  will  generate  a written memorandum detailing the transfer of investigative responsibility and file it with the final S2I case file. AFOSI or S2I will then transfer all case file information and evidence to the other agency. (T-1) 2.1.2.  S2I  may  provide  investigative  assistance  to  AFOSI,  if  the  local  AFOSI  field  unit commander or SAIC and DFC jointly make a determination of need. 2.1.3.  Investigators  will  promptly  notify  unit  commanders  each  time  an  investigation  is initiated  on  persons  under  their  control,  unless  there  is  a  need  to  maintain  strict  security controls  over  an  investigative  operation.  In  such  cases,  unit  commanders  are  briefed  and provided written notification when there is no longer a need to maintain strict security. (T-2) 2.1.4.  DFCs will ensure AFOSI is notified upon initiation of all criminal investigations IAW DODI  5505.16,  Criminal  Investigations  by  Personnel  Who  Are  Not  Assigned  to  a  Defense Criminal Investigative Organization. (T-0) 2.1.5.  Internal  Security  Forces  Investigations.  Not  all  complaints  against  Security  Forces members should be immediately referred to S2I.  While S2I is the SF commander’s POC for fielding complaints against Security Forces members and DAF/CP for incidents occurring on or  off-duty,  only  allegations  of  criminal  activity  clearly  within  S2I’s  investigative responsibility will be referred to S2I. Any matters within AFOSI’s investigative purview will be referred to AFOSI. In addition, the DFC will ensure OSI is notified when S2I initiates a criminal  investigation  involving  an  SF  member.  Discipline  and  general  misconduct  issues will  be  handled  via  a  Commander-Directed  Inquiry  (CDI)  assigned  by  the  DFC  to  a  unit Senior Noncommissioned Officer (SNCO) or Officer.” (T-1) 2.2.  Training.  SF investigators/detectives must complete one of the following: Military Police Investigator  (MPI)  Course  or  AFOSI  Basic  Special  Investigator  Course  (BSIC).  NOTE:  The DFC may temporarily assign SF members that have not attended formal training to investigator positions;  however,  they  must  complete  a  locally  derived  On  the  Job  Training  (OJT)  program documented on a memorandum for record (MFR) and AF Form 797, Job Qualification Standard, until a class date can be acquired. Formal training for these individuals is the goal. (T-1) 2.2.1.  As  a  minimum,  S2I  should  have  locally  developed  AF  Forms  797  indicating investigator  certification/training.  See  attachment  2  for  a  sample  AF  Form  797.  If  any   8  AFI31-115  10 NOVEMBER 2014 additional  training  is  required  in  support  of  the  specific  position/environment,  this information must be annotated on the AF Form 797. (T-2) 2.2.2.  IAW  the  requirements  outlined  in  the  Air  Force  Enlisted  Classification  Directory (AFECD),  an  investigator  is  awarded  the  Special  Experience  Identifier  (SEI)  after completion  of  either  L5AZA3P071  0S5A,  Military  Police  Investigations  (Personal  Data System  (PDS)  code  RZ4),  or  5T5ALO7S031  005,  Basic  Special  Investigator  Course  (PDS code I90), and after obtaining both 12 months of experience as a full time SF investigator and DFC recommendation. 2.2.2.1.  After completion of SEI requirements, the unit training manager must initiate an AF Form 2096, Classification/On-the-Job Training Action, and obtain the investigator’s and DFC’s signatures on the form. The AF Form 2096 is then given to the Force Support Squadron to update the appropriate SEI in the Military Personnel Data System (MilPDS). (T-2) 2.2.2.2.  If the DFC disapproves the SEI, a justification must be added by the DFC in the comments section of the AF Form 2096. (T-2) 2.3.  Credentials. 2.3.1.  The DFC issues the following credentials to members of the S2I section: (T-1) 2.3.1.1.  AF Form 688A, Security Forces Investigator Credential. 2.3.1.2.  AF Form 688B, Security Forces Detective Credential, to civilian personnel. 2.3.2.  Credentials  may  be  issued  to  graduates  of  one  of  the  approved  courses  identified  in paragraph 2.2. 2.3.3.  The  DFC  may  issue  credentials  to  members  who  they  believe  have  the  necessary technical  expertise,  formal  education  and/or  training.  NOTE:  In  the  absence  of  a  qualified investigator/detective, the DFC may issue credentials to persons with less experience or part-time investigators. All credentials issued to part time investigators will be maintained within the S2I section when part time investigators are not performing investigative duties. Destroy part time investigator credentials as outlined in paragraph 2.3.5. 2.3.4.  The  DFC  ensures  investigators  and  detectives  carry/utilize  the  respective  AF  Form 688A/B only while in  the performance of their official  duties. Credentials  are valid only  as long  as  the  holder  is  performing  investigative  duties  within  the  issuing  unit.  The  credential expiration date should generally not exceed three (3) years from date of issue. (T-2) 2.3.5.  Destroy  withdrawn  credentials  upon  a  person’s  change  in  status,  such  as  Permanent Change  of  Station  (PCS)  or  reassignment  to  a  different  duty  section.  Document  credential destruction  on  AF  Form  310,  Document  Receipt  and  Destruction  Certificate,  and  maintain the  certificate  with  other  AF  Form  688A/B  accountability  records.  NOTE:  The  DFC  may present  an  investigator/detective  their  credential  as  a  PCS  or  retirement  memento.  In  doing so,  the  commander  must  render  the  credential  unserviceable.  Marking  the  credential  in  red block letters "INVALID" or encasing them in poured acrylic are just two possible options. (T-2) 2.3.6.  Ensure control and protection of blank credential forms against theft and unauthorized use.  If blank or issued credentials  are lost or stolen, an investigation will be conducted and AFI31-115  10 NOVEMBER 2014   9  documented  via  an  ROI  or  AF  Form  3545A,  Security  Forces  Incident  Report.  Blank credentials  will  be  stored  in  a  lockable  drawer,  safe  or  filing  cabinet.  The  S2I  NCOIC  will conduct  an inventory quarterly of all unissued credentials  and notify the  DFC in  writing of any discrepancies. (T-2) 2.4.  Badges and Shields. 2.4.1.  SF  investigators  will  utilize  the  SF  shield  along  with  the  AF  Form  688A  when identifying themselves in performance of their official duties. 2.4.2.  Civilian  detectives  will  utilize  the  DAF  Detective  badge  along  with  the  AF  Form 688B when identifying themselves in the performance of their official duties. 2.4.2.1.  DAF/CP  0083  Detectives  are  employed  by  the  DFC.  They  will  be  issued  a Department  of  the  Air  Force  Detective  Badge  (example  in  attachment  3)  in  lieu  of  the DAF/CP  badge.  The  detective  badge  will  be  funded  by  the  issuing  unit.  DAF/CP  0083 Detectives have the same authority, jurisdiction and limitations covering SF members. 2.4.3.  For information on the wear/display of the badge or shield, see paragraph 2.5.1. and 2.6.4. of this instruction. 2.5.  Uniform Wear/Civilian Attire.  It is highly encouraged that SF investigators/detectives not wear  the  military  uniform  with  the  SF  shield/badge  while  performing  investigative  duties.  If approved  by  the  DFC,  SF  investigators/detectives  are  authorized  to  wear  civilian  clothes  when performing  investigative  duties.  Civilian  attire,  when  worn,  will  be  casual  and  in  good  taste. Protecting the grades of the SF investigators/detectives through wear of civilian clothing is part of  an  overall  effort  to  achieve  efficiency  in  the  investigative  office.  SF  investigators/detectives interact daily, often in an adversarial role, with individuals who are junior and senior in grade to them.  NOTE:  To  avoid  confusion  with  AFOSI  agents  or local  police  personnel, investigators/detectives  conducting  investigative  activity  while  wearing  civilian  clothing  will clearly  identify  themselves  as  “Security  Forces  Investigators  or  Detectives”  unless  doing  so would reasonably compromise operational security. 2.5.1.  Investigators and detectives in  civilian attire will wear/display their respective shield or  badge  affixed  to  their  belt  or  otherwise  prominently  displayed  while  armed  and  on  duty when it does not interfere with the performance of their duties as stated in paragraph 2.6.4. of this instruction. (T-3) 2.5.2.  Military active duty personnel permanently assigned as SF investigators may be, at the discretion of the DFC, authorized a one-time initial civilian clothing allowance IAW AFI 36-3014,  Clothing  Allowances  for  Air  Force  Personnel,  and  DOD  Regulation  7000.14-R, Volume 7A, Military Pay Policy And Procedures - Active Duty And Reserve Pay, Chapter 29. 2.5.3.  The DFC may authorize the use of locally procured clothing items with the SF shield or  “POLICE”  embroidered  on  them  for  use  while  on  duty  in  civilian  clothes  for  certain situations.  The  DFC  may  also  authorize  the  appropriate  winter/cold  weather  attire  for  SF investigators, as deemed appropriate. 2.5.4.  Military  investigators  will  maintain  proper  military  uniforms  and  have  SF  duty  gear immediately available. 2.6.  Weapons.  SF  investigators/detectives  often  respond  to  incidents  within  moments  of  an initial  patrolman scene.  SF secure  a  crime immediately response in  order to   10  AFI31-115  10 NOVEMBER 2014 investigators/detectives will be armed IAW DODD 5210.56, Carrying of Firearms and the Use of  Force  by  DOD  Personnel  Engaged  in  Security,  Law  and  Order,  or  Counterintelligence Activities. (T-0) 2.6.1.  The  DFC  is  the  approval  authority  for  S2I  members  to  bear  and  use  firearms  both openly  and  concealed.  The  NCOIC  or  Chief  of  Investigations  (S2I)  has  the  same discretionary arming authority as an SF operations flight sergeant and can dictate verbally or in writing when S2I personnel will be armed to perform official duties. Compliance with AFI 31-117, Arming and Use of Force by Air Force Personnel, and AFMAN 31-222, Air Force Use  of  Force  Manual,  is  mandatory  for  all  S2I  personnel  when  carrying  weapons  either openly  or  concealed.  SF  investigators/detectives  not  in  uniform  who  have  to  openly  bear firearms  when  performing  official  military  duties  must  obtain  an  AF  Form  523,  USAF Authorization to Bear Firearms, IAW AFI 31-117. (T-1) 2.6.2.  Approved https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/AF-ED-00-29/default.aspx. and  weapons holsters equipment can be found at: 2.6.3.  Training.  IAW  AFI  36-2226,  Combat  Arms  Program,  credentialed  SF  investigators will be assigned, as a minimum, the USAF service pistol (M9 or M11 if available), as their primary duty weapon. (T-1) 2.6.4.  Open  Carry.  When  armed,  SF  investigators/detectives  must  carry  their  credentials, appropriate badge/shield and an approved AF Form 523, if the weapon is concealed. When a weapon  is  openly  displayed  while  in  civilian  clothes,  the  SF  Shield  or  DAF  badge  will  be clipped next to the holster, on a chain around the neck or otherwise prominently displayed for quick visual identification. (T-1) 2.6.5.  Concealed  Carry.  SF  investigators  will  be  trained  and  certified  to  carry  concealed weapons  IAW  AFI  36-2226.  SF  investigators/detectives  do  not  routinely  conceal  their weapons unless necessary to protect the integrity of an investigation and only with the prior approval of the DFC or designee. (T-1) 2.6.6.  Weapons  Storage.  The  DFC  may  authorize,  in  writing,  the  storage  of  SF investigator/detective  firearms  and  ammunition  within  their  duty  section,  if  all  storage requirements  of  AFI  31-101,  Integrated  Defense,  are  met.  If  S2I  stores  weapons  outside  of the SF Armory, local procedures must be developed to ensure that security standards of the weapons and proper clearing procedures are being met. Place a small portable clearing barrel for  proper  loading  and  clearing  of  weapons  stored  at  the  S2I  duty  section  next  to  the approved storage container. Provide proper Hazardous Classification Marking for the type of weapons items stored. 2.6.7.  Issuing the AF Form 523, USAF Authorization to Bear Firearms. 2.6.7.1.  The  AF  Form  523  must  have  standardized  permit  numbers.  For  example,  802 SFS  10-0002  (CONCEALED)  refers  to  the  second  concealed  permit  issued  in  2010  by the 802d Security Forces Squadron at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland, Texas. (T-3) 2.6.7.2.  The  AF  Form  523  issued  for  off-base  operations  requires  full  frontal  face photographs.  All  others  contain  the  statement  "VALID  ON  (INSTALLATION  NAME) ONLY”. (T-3) AFI31-115  10 NOVEMBER 2014   11  2.6.7.3.  The expiration on the AF Form 523 will coincide with the expiration date of the AF Form 688. It will not exceed the expiration date on the investigator’s/detective’s AF Form 688 unless authorized in writing by the DFC. (T-3) 2.6.7.4.  Surrender the form to the issuing authority upon completion of duties requiring authority to bear a concealed firearm or change of assignment from S2I section. (T-2) 2.6.8.  Loading  and  Unloading  Firearms.  Loading  and  unloading  firearms  will  be  IAW AFMAN 31-229, Air Force Weapons Handling Manual. 2.6.9.  Non-Lethal  Use  of  Force.  IAW  AFI  31-118,  Security  Forces  Standards  and Procedures,  when  SF  investigators/detectives  are  armed  with  a  lethal  capability  they  will also  have  at  least  one  type  of  non-lethal  capability.  They  will  be  trained  and  employ  non-lethal  methods  and  equipment  to  the  greatest  extent  possible.  The  OC  spray  is  ideal,  but collapsible  batons  are  also  an  option.  Investigators/detectives  may  use  manufacturer approved ankle holsters  for batons  and the z-205 OC spray.  NOTE: When using the z-205 OC  spray,  measures  must  be  taken  to  prevent  the  immediate  use  of  the  Taser  on  a  suspect who has been sprayed. The Taser may cause the suspect to ignite if the individual has been be sprayed within 30 seconds of Taser employment. (T-1) 2.7.  Reimbursement.  SF investigators/detectives will submit a Standard Form 1164, Claim for Reimbursement  for  Expenditures  on  Official  Business,  for  all  reimbursable  expenses  incurred while conducting an official investigation. DFCs must pre-approve reimbursement for expenses incurred  while  conducting  an  investigation.  Refer  to  DOD  Financial  Management  Regulation (FMR), volume 10, for specific guidance. (T-2) 2.7.1.  Contact  local  Staff  Judge  Advocate  (SJA)  and  the  base  Comptroller  Squadron  to ensure all financial management instructions and procedures are followed. 2.8.  S2I  Office  Recommendations.  While these items are not required, these additional items may increase the effectiveness of the S2I program. It is highly encouraged that DFCs attempt to procure each or any combination of the following items: 2.8.1.  Specific computer resources. 2.8.1.1.  Unrestricted internet access. 2.8.2.  A landline dedicated to receiving “anonymous” tips. 2.8.3.  A dedicated landline with an “unlisted” number. 2.8.4.  One marked and/or unmarked vehicle for emergency response. 2.8.4.1.  A vehicle with tinted windows would be ideal for this purpose, as investigators need  proper  storage  capability  to  keep  various  tools  and  investigative  kits  readily available.  MAJCOMs  will  define  specific  vehicle  authorizations  to  support  S2I operations. When feasible, local state and/or host nation license plates (cover plates) can be used instead of government plates. When cover plates are used, they must be removed and replaced with the government license plate prior to servicing or supporting any other SF operation as directed by the DFC. 2.8.4.2.  Vehicle  Equipment.  As  a  minimum,  S2I  vehicles  should  be  equipped  with  low profile emergency lights, siren, mobile radio and PA system.   12  AFI31-115  10 NOVEMBER 2014 2.8.4.3.  Emergency  Vehicle  Operations.  Investigators  must  comply  with  all  the  same requirements  as  marked  patrol  units.  Unmarked  vehicles  will  not  be  used  in  a  pursuit. Off-base emergency operations are prohibited unless a memorandum of understanding is coordinated  through  the  base  legal  office  and  approved  by  the  installation  commander and local authorities. 2.8.4.4.  Specialized  Vehicles.  Based  upon  need/utilization,  DFCs  may  authorize  S2I  to be  assigned  a  specialized  marked  vehicle  for  Crime  Scene  Processing,  Crisis/Hostage Negotiation and on-scene confrontation management processing. 2.8.5.  A portable clearing barrel is to be utilized in the event that weapons are stored within the S2I section IAW paragraphs 2.6.5. and 2.6.7. of this instruction. AFI31-115  10 NOVEMBER 2014   13  Chapter 3 EVIDENCE HANDLING/PROCESSING & STORAGE 3.1.  Evidence  Custodians  (EC).  DFCs  will  appoint  ECs  in  writing.  ECs  must  positively identify and strictly account for evidence to assure admissibility at legal proceedings. (T-1) 3.1.1.  Conduct  inventories  of  all  evidence  at  least  quarterly,  more  frequently  if  determined locally, and inform the DFC in writing of discrepancies. (T-2) 3.1.2.  When  changing  ECs,  regardless  of  whether  the  primary  or  alternate  is  changing, complete the following items: (T-2) 3.1.2.1.  Conduct an inventory of all evidence. 3.1.2.2.  Document the transfer of custodians in the front of the evidence logbook. 3.1.2.3.  Change all applicable storage/locker combinations. 3.2.  Handling Evidence. 3.2.1.  S2I must ensure the following procedures are met: 3.2.1.1.  Evidence handling procedures and search and seizure are defined in AFI 31-118. S2I  members  who  receive  evidence  must  take  caution  in  order  to  prevent  cross-contamination of evidence at all levels of evidence processing. 3.2.1.2.  Except  in  unusual  circumstances,  physical  evidence  will  be  released  to  the  EC no later than the first working day after it is acquired. The evidence will be controlled by the  person  securing  it  until  released  to  the  custodian.  Activities  served  by  an  EC  in  a separate  location  will  release  the  evidence  either  physically,  by  registered  mail  or  by  a recognized  major  US  commercial  shipping  service  with  an  accountable  tracking  system (e.g., United States Postal Service®) to the servicing EC normally within 2 working days after  the  evidence  is  acquired.  Local  agencies  or  US  Magistrates  may  allow  for  the immediate  return  of  a  person’s(s’)  personal  property.  With  prior  coordination,  evidence involving  civilians  committing  minor  or  non-violent  crimes  can  be  photographed  and released. This must be captured in local policy. (T-2) 3.2.1.3.  Record  all  evidence  in  ink  in  a  permanently  bound  evidence  log  with consecutively  numbered  pages.  Do  not  remove  pages  from  the  log  or  erase  entries.  Do not  use  correction  fluids  or  correction  tape.  Draw  a  line  through  mistakes  and  initial them.  If  an  evidence  tracker  (log)  is  developed  in  a  Security  Forces  Information Management  System  (SFMIS)  release,  it  will  be  the  only  electronic  evidence  log authorized and evidence accountability will be done via an MFR. In lieu of a handwritten log book, the DFC may authorize the S2I to utilize an electronic evidence logging system if available. (T-2) 3.2.1.4.  Store  evidence  in  lockers,  safes  or  rooms  designated  solely  for  that  purpose. Designate  such  areas  as  controlled  areas  and  comply  with  the  requirements  of  AFI  31-101. Develop procedures to make evidence storage containers or rooms accessible only to the  EC(s).  If  stored  in  same  room,  found  property  must  be  stored  separately  from evidence. (T-2)   14  AFI31-115  10 NOVEMBER 2014 3.2.1.4.1.  When  evidence  is  temporarily  released  from  the  evidence  room  for  any reason  (e.g.,  an  Article  32  hearing  or  courts-martial),  the  original  AF  Form  52, Evidence  Tag,  will  accompany  the  evidence.  Annotate  the  evidence  log  with  the location  of  the  evidence.  Exception:  United  States  Army  Criminal  Investigations Laboratory (USACIL) and some state laboratories do not accept the AF Form 52. In these  cases,  the  original  AF  Form  52  will  remain  with  the  case  notes  until  the evidence is returned from the lab. (T-2) 3.2.1.5.  Store  firearms  and  ammunition  evidence  in  approved  containers,  as  defined  in AFI 31-101, in the SF armory or S2I office. Storage of this type of evidence outside the armory must be approved by the DFC in  writing.  Explosives (military and commercial) and  explosive  materials  will  be  properly  stored  within  the  munitions  storage  area. Evidence  collection  and  custody  receipt  agreements  between  SF  and  the  MSA commander  will  be  in  place  to  assure  there  is  no  break  in  the  chain  of  custody  or tampering with the evidence. (T-2) 3.2.1.6.  Secure controlled substances (other than residue and paraphernalia) away from other evidence.  If  the  evidence  room  does  not  meet  physical  security  requirements,  controlled substances will be secured in a Government Services Administration (GSA) approved Class 5 safe. The approved safe may be located in the same room as evidence. (T-1) 3.2.1.6.1.  Storing  drug  evidence  with  military  working  dog  training  aids  is prohibited. (T-1) 3.2.1.7.  Obtain written approval from the SJA before disposing of evidence. This may be in  the  form  of  an  official  memorandum  or  digitally  signed  email.  Document  the  final disposition  on  evidence  tags  in  the  evidence  logbook.  Have  one  witness  present  when destroying drugs or other items  not  returnable to the owner.  It  is  recommended that the local  police  department  or  another  local  law  enforcement  agency  destroy  drugs  and/or weapons. For those who witness the destruction of evidence, document their participation by printing on the back of the AF Form 52 the date of destruction and the name, duty title and organization of the witness. Have the witness sign above their printed name. If there is not enough room on the back of the AF Form 52, use a new AF Form 52 to capture this information. (T-1) 3.2.1.8.  US  Army  Criminal  Investigation  Laboratory  (USACIL)  Forensic  Examination Procedures.  Requests  for  USACIL  forensic  evidence  laboratory  examination  must  be  made using  Department  of  Defense  (DD)  Form  2922,  Forensic  Laboratory  Examination  Request (see attachment 4), and the evidence being submitted must be accompanied by Department of the Army (DA) Form 4137, Evidence/Property Custody Document. Download the DD Form 2922 at http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/infomgt/forms/formsprogram.htm. Download the DA Form 4137 at http://www.apd.army.mil/Forms/browse_forms.asp. 3.2.1.8.1.  Packaging the Evidence. Attach a plain envelope marked “invoice” on the inner  wrapping  of  the  shipping  container  and  place  the  DD  Form  2922  and  the  DA Form 4137 inside. NOTE: Failure to place these forms in the invoice envelope or to place the invoice envelope on the inner wrapping of the box of evidence may result in unnecessary delays in evidence processing. (T-2) 3.2.1.8.2.  Submitting Evidence to USACIL. Attach a photocopy of the respective AF Form  52  evidence  tag  to  the  evidence  submitted  to  USACIL.  Store  the  original AFI31-115  10 NOVEMBER 2014   15  evidence  tag  in  the  S2I  evidence  room  during  the  laboratory  examination.  If  the evidence is sealed in an individual container, attach a copy of the evidence tag on the outside  of  the  respective  container.  Refer  to  paragraph  3.2.1.11.2.  for  additional information on proper packaging and shipping evidence to USACIL. (T-2) 3.2.1.8.2.1.  Use  the  DD  Form  2922  to  transmit  evidence  to  a  laboratory  and  to describe  the  types  of  examinations  and  analysis  needed.  File  a  copy  of  the completed DD Form 2922 in the case file. (T-2) 3.2.1.8.2.2.  If  a  large  quantity  of  evidence  is  available,  determine  how  much  is needed by the laboratory for the desired examination. 3.2.1.8.2.3.  If only a small quantity of the material is available for analysis, and it is  possible  the  entire  sample  may  be  consumed  by  the  laboratory  in  testing, coordinate with the laboratory and servicing SJA before analysis. 3.2.1.8.2.4.  Segregate  and  individually  wrap  and  seal  items  being  sent  for analysis. Identify each item on the DD Form 2922 and place a copy of the form in the container. Do not send evidence from more than one case, subject or victim in the same container. Do  not  ship  the subject’s and victim’s evidence in  the same container. (T-2) 3.2.1.8.3.  Completing  the  DD  Form  2922,  Forensic  Laboratory  Examination Request. (T-2) 3.2.1.8.3.1.  Select the “USACIL” box if sending evidence to United States Army Criminal Investigation Laboratory (USACIL), or select the “Other” box and insert the appropriate laboratory name and address in block 1. 3.2.1.8.3.2.  If  the  SF  unit  uses  an  Army  Post  Office  (APO)  address,  list  the geographical location of the unit after the complete address in block 2. 3.2.1.8.3.3.  Complete  block  3  with  the  appropriate  unit  address,  even  if  the evidence is to be returned to the submitting unit. 3.2.1.8.3.4.  Indicate the exam priority in block 4.

Identify the examinations requested in block 13. 3.2.1.8.3.15.  Identify the lead investigator in block 14. 3.2.1.8.3.16.  SF  investigators  may  contact  the  local  OSI  unit  for  assistance  in completing the DD Form 2922, as needed. 3.2.1.9.  DA Form 4137, Evidence/Property Custody Document. All evidence, associated to  the  same  case  file,  being  sent  to  USACIL  for  examination  will  be  listed  on  the  DA Form  4137  in  the  “Description  of  Articles”  block  (see  Figure  2.1.).  The  Description  of Articles  block  must  contain  the  evidence  tag  number  and  the  description,  condition, identification  and  location  from  where  it  was  seized.  The  description  must  match  the description on the original AF Form 52. (T-2) 3.2.1.9.1.  If  additional  space  is  needed  on  the  DA  Form  4137,  continue  on  another DA Form 4137. The item numbering of the second form will remain successive to the item numbering of the first form. For example, if item “3” was the last entry on the first  DA  Form  4137,  item  “4”  will  be  the  first  entry  on  the  second  DA  Form  4137. Annotate “Page X of Y” for the “Document Number” at the bottom of DA Form 4137. X and Y represent the current page and total number of pages, respectively. (T-2) 3.2.1.9.2.  When sending evidence to USACIL, the EC will annotate the following on the original copy of the AF Form 52, Chain of Custody Receipt: the releasing agent will sign and date the ‘Released By’ block; the ‘Purpose’ block will contain “Sent to USACIL” and the registered mail number; the ‘Condition’ block will contain the item number as reflected on the DA Form 4137; and the ‘Received By’ block will contain “Refer to DA Form 4137.” (T-2) 3.2.1.9.3.  Upon  return  of  the  evidence,  the  EC  will  annotate  the  following  on  the original  AF  Form  52.  The  ‘Released  By’  block  will  contain  “Refer  to  DA  Form 4137”; the ‘Purpose’ block will contain “Returned from USACIL” and the registered mail number; the ‘Condition’ block will contain the item number as reflected on the DA Form 4137; and the receiving agent will sign and date the ‘Received By’ block. The  EC  will  inventory  all  items,  to  include  breaking  seals  if  the  evidence  count cannot be verified visually. If the evidence is drug evidence, the EC will re-weigh the sample and annotate condition changes in the ‘Condition’ block. (T-2) 3.2.1.9.4.  Upon return of the evidence from USACIL, the EC will attach the original DA Form 4137, or a copy thereof for multiple items, to the original AF Form 52 and attach both documents to the respective evidence. (T-2) AFI31-115  10 NOVEMBER 2014   17  3.2.1.10.  Submitting  Evidence  to  State  Laboratories.  State  laboratories  may  require  the use  of  their  own  departmental  forms.  In  those  instances,  the  EC  will  use  the  state laboratory forms in lieu of DD Form 2922 and DA Form 4137. Complete the appropriate blocks  on  the  laboratory  forms  to  document  the  specifics  of  the  case,  evidence accountability  and  requested  analysis.  The  DFC  will  codify  local  guidance  for  specific procedures. (T-2) 3.2.1.10.1.  Upon return of the evidence, the EC will properly complete the following blocks  on  the  original  AF  Form  52  to  document  the  chain  of  custody  changes:  the ‘Released  By’  block;  the  ‘Purpose’  block;  the  ‘Condition’  block;  and  the  receiving agent will sign and date the ‘Received By’ block. The EC will inventory all items, to include  breaking  seals  if  the  evidence  count  cannot  be  verified  visually.  If  the evidence  is  drug  evidence,  the  EC  will  re-weigh  the  sample  and  annotate  condition changes in the ‘Condition’ block. (T-2) 3.2.1.11.  Shipping Evidence. USPS® Registered Mail™ or FedEx® must be used when shipping  evidence  to  forensic  laboratories.  In  situations  when  expediency  is  important and  when  appropriate  USPS®,  FedEx®  or  Military  Airlift  services  are  not  reasonably available,  other  commercial  carriers  may  be  used.  In  such  instances,  Base  Information Transfer Center (BITC) regulations may require that sending units bypass BITC and pay for  shipment  costs  using  unit  funds.  Consult  the  local  BITC  for  further  guidance. Commercial  carriers  must  meet  the  following  criteria  to  be  used  for  shipping  evidence. (FedEx®  is  a  registered  trademark  of  FedEx  Corporation.)  Explosives  and  hazardous materials must be shipped in accordance with Department of Transportation (DOT) rules and regulations, 40 CFR 260 through 266, and 49 CFR 300-302. (T-1) 3.2.1.11.1.  The carrier  must use a method of tracking the evidence during shipment that preserves the chain of custody. (T-1) 3.2.1.11.2.  The  carrier  must  have  demonstrated  an  ability  to  consistently  deliver  all packages to their required final destination on time and undamaged. 3.2.1.11.3.  When  shipping  evidence,  enter  the  USPS  registration  number,  tracking number  or  BITC  accountable  container  number  in  the  ‘Purpose’  block  of  the  AF Form 52. (T-2) 3.2.1.12.  Packaging  and  Sending.  Double  wrap  evidence  with  the  caption  “To  Be Opened by Evidence Custodian Only” marked on the inner wrapping. Show no indication on the outer wrapping that the package contains evidence. (T-2) 3.2.1.12.1.  For laboratory analysis, mark the inside wrapper “EVIDENCE.” Affix an envelope marked “INVOICE” to the inner wrapper. Address the outer wrapper to the lab section. If drugs, do not mark “NARCOTICS SECTION,” use “CHEMISTRY” or leave  blank.  See  paragraph  3.2.1.9.  for  more  information  when  sending  evidence  to USACIL. 3.2.1.12.2.  Use  laboratory  procedures  when  sending  probable-cause  urine  samples. (T-1) 3.2.1.12.3.  Consult  USPS®  to  ensure  compliance  with  firearm  and  ammunition shipment regulations.   18  AFI31-115  10 NOVEMBER 2014 3.2.1.12.4.  Affix “SHARP  HAZARD”  or “BIOHAZARD,”  to  inner  packages  containing  dangerous  or  potentially  infectious evidence. (T-0) appropriate labels, such as 3.2.1.12.5.  When  receiving  evidence  from  forensic  laboratories  or  other  sources, request  that  the  evidence  be  shipped  via  USPS®  Registered  Mail™,  FedEx®  or  a proven and reliable commercial carrier (see paragraph 3.2.1.11.). Enter the Registered Mail™ number or the tracking number in the ‘Purpose’ block of the AF Form 52 if the releasing agency or laboratory failed to do so. (T-2) 3.3.  Receipt/Disposition  of  Property.  When  appropriate,  SF  may  take  custody  of  private  or government property not requiring the same degree of legal accountability as evidence. SF will generally  not  take  custody  of  property  (except  for  dangerous  weapons,  such  as  firearms,  stun guns  or  other  destructive  devices)  left  with  another  installation  agency  (i.e.,  luggage  left  by passengers at the passenger terminal; personal property left in or around barracks, exchanges and commissaries).  MAJCOM/A7S  should  establish  guidelines  on  conditions  and  circumstances under which their units accept lost, found or acquired property. 3.3.1.  Use  an  AF  Form  52  as  a  receipt  for  lost,  found  or  acquired  property.  Items  with indeterminate  value  and  no  risk  of  liability  to  Security  Forces  members  (i.e.,  found identification cards), units can develop local procedures in lieu of the use of AF Form 52. (T-1) 3.3.2.  Use locally developed procedures to log and track this type of property. Use separate log books for acquired and evidential property. (T-1) 3.3.3.  Store  lost,  found  and  acquired  property  separately  from  evidence.  Lost  or  found property  may  be  stored  in  an  evidence  room;  however,  it  must  be  clearly  separated  (i.e., separate bin or shelf) from stored evidence. (T-1) 3.3.4.  The  Base  Property  Disposal  Board  may  choose  to  dispose  of  property  in  one  of  the following manners. NOTE: The formation of the board is not inherently an SF responsibility and specific guidance on the formation and role of the board can be found in DOD Manual 4160.21-M, Defense Material Disposition Manual: 3.3.4.1.  Turn  the  item(s)  over  to  the  Defense  Reutilization  and  Management  Office (DRMO) in accordance with DOD Manual 4160.21-M. (T-0) 3.3.4.2.  Donate  the  item(s)  to  a  military  or  private  charity.  Military  munitions  (parts, pieces,  casing,  fuses,  etc.)  will  not  be  donated  to  any  agency,  military  or  private. Although  casings  may  appear  to  be  safe,  the  mechanics  surrounding  its  operations  or residue associated with its previous explosive components may be present. (T-1) 3.3.4.3.  As otherwise directed by the  Installation Commander with  guidance from  SJA. For  example,  destroy,  convert  to  government  use  or  transfer  through  a  no  cost  contract with local business/agency (for disposal of abandoned vehicles). 3.3.5.  Regardless  of  the  disposal  option  selected,  units  must  still  comply  with  the requirements  of  DOD  4160.21-M,  Defense  Material  Disposition  Manual,  and  DODI 4140.62,  Material  Potentially  Presenting  and  Explosive  Hazard  (MPPEH),  regarding identification  and  notification  of  owners  and  the  time  frames  required  for  holding  property before disposition. (T-0) AFI31-115  10 NOVEMBER 2014   19  3.3.6.  Demilitarize  all  unclaimed  firearms.  Do  this  through  turn-in  to  DRMO  or  through destruction procedures found in DOD 4160.28-M-V3, Defense Demilitarization: Procedural Guidance.    Demilitarize  all  major  assemblies  to  preclude  reuse  or  reassembly  with  other parts. (T-0) 3.3.7.  The  disposition  of  funds  will  be  determined  using  guidance  received  from  the  local Comptroller  and  SJA.  Complete  DD  Form  1131,  Cash  Collection  Voucher,  annotate disposition and have the finance representative sign the AF Form 52, if the funds are released to the Comptroller. (T-1) 3.4.  Special Storage Considerations for Evidence. 3.4.1.  Perishable  items  will  be  immediately  photographed  and  kept  as  long  as  feasible. Attach  the  photograph  to  the  AF  Form  52.  If  items  become  rotten  or  evaporate  due  to extensive amount of time in storage, annotate the circumstances in the log book and AF Form 52.  Items  that  could  be  considered  a  health  hazard  if  maintained  will  be  photographed  and properly  disposed  of  after  coordination  with  the  SJA.  In  addition,  coordinate  with  SJA  to determine if items can be released back to base stores (e.g., the commissary). (T-1) 3.4.2.  Flammable  material  will  be  dealt  with  immediately  by  contacting  the  on-call investigator who will make the decision on the safest place for storage. Coordination will be made  with  SJA  for  approval  to  take  photographs  of  the  item  instead  of  storing  item  in  the evidence  room  and  risking  contamination.  Ensure  the  evidence  room  is  rated  to  store flammable  material  and  provide  proper  Hazardous  Classification  Marking  for  the  type  of flammable  material/items  stored  in  evidence  room.  Coordinate  movement  of  flammable material/items with installation Fire Chief. (T-1) 3.4.3.  Explosives  not  suitable  for  storage  in  the  SF  Armory  evidence  locker  will  be photographed  and,  if  possible,  stored  at  the  munitions  storage  area.  Military  munitions  and military  explosives  deemed  as  unstable  or  too  dangerous  for  storage  will  be  photographed and  then  disposed  of  by  Explosive  Ordnance  Disposal  (EOD)  personnel  upon  coordination with  the  SJA.  EOD  may  not  dispose  of  fireworks  without  special  permission  from  their MAJCOM or other authority having jurisdiction. (T-2) 3.4.4.  Special Considerations for Controlled Substances and Drug Paraphernalia. (T-1) 3.4.4.1.  Suspected drugs will not be placed in temporary evidence storage containers. An on-call  investigator  will  be  summoned  to  take  custody  of  and  properly  store  all  drug evidence. (T-1) 3.4.4.2.  Upon  receipt  of  marijuana/hashish/cocaine  or  other  illegal  drugs  that  are  not pills, the investigator/detective weighs the item using a calibrated scale and annotates the approximate gross weight (in grams) on the AF Form 52. If the weight is so small as to be negligible, state this on the AF Form 52. Ensure the description indicates if the weight includes  packaging  or  storage  container.  Drugs  in  the  form  of  pills  will  be  counted instead of weighed. (T-1) 3.4.5.  Special Considerations for Firearms and Ammunition. 3.4.5.1.  If  firearms  and/or  ammunition  are  seized  as  evidence,  an  investigator  will immediately  respond  and  assume  custody  of  the  item.  Firearms  will  not  be  placed  in  a temporary  storage  container.  Firearms  and  ammunition  will  not  be  stored  in  the  same   20  AFI31-115  10 NOVEMBER 2014 containers.  During  collection  of  evidence  gathered  from  improvised  explosive  devices (IED), military ordnance or other explosively enhanced materials, extreme caution should be  used  and  all  explosive  safety  handling  rules  should  be  followed.  Contact  the installation’s  EOD  unit  or  closest  Service  EOD  unit  to  assist  in  the  collection  of  the evidence if there are any concerns or unknowns associated with the material. During IED incidents, the EOD team will assist in the collection of evidence by providing appropriate safety  measures  and  oversight.  EOD  teams  will  not  take  custody  of  evidence  nor  sign collection evidence reports or receipts. (T-1) 3.4.5.2.  If  the  evidence  is  considered  a  legal  (and  properly  registered)  weapon,  which was used in the commission of a crime, the SJA will determine its disposition. (T-1) 3.4.5.3.  If  the  evidence  is  a  legal  weapon  which  was  not  used  in  the  commission  of  a crime,  it  will  be  released  back  to  its  rightful  owner,  providing  the  individual’s commander and the SJA concur with the disposition. (T-1) 3.4.5.4.  Any  illegal  firearm  (or  if  a  firearm  is  ordered  forfeited  by  the  court)  will  be destroyed upon coordination with SJA. Weapons should only be returned when they no longer have evidentiary value or are otherwise needed for the justice process. (T-1) 3.4.5.5.  Upon seizure, conduct  a National  Crime  Information  Center (NCIC) query  and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) eTrace database check on all firearms to determine status, legal ownership and other pertinent details. (T-0) 3.4.5.6.  For storage of confiscated firearms the following applies: 3.4.5.6.1.  Non  DOD  weapons  are  not  required  to  be  stored  with  the  same  physical security  standards  as  DOD  weapons.  MAJCOMs  or  DFCs  will  create  security standards for the storage of non DOD weapons. 3.4.5.6.2.  DOD weapons will be stored IAW AFI 31-101. AFI31-115  10 NOVEMBER 2014   21  Chapter 4 ADDITIONAL SUPPORT 4.1.  Joint  Drug  Enforcement  Team  (JDET).  AFOSI,  in  coordination  with  the  DFC  and Installation Commander, may establish an AFOSI/SF JDET. Once formed, these teams become the focal point for the USAF anti-drug efforts at the installation level. After JDET establishment, the AFOSI field unit commander/SAIC has tactical control over the team and therefore decides the  type/extent  of  direct  participation  the  SF  member  will  have  in  AFOSI  operations.  JDET members  are  operationally  controlled  (OPCON)  and  administratively  controlled  (ADCON)  by the host SFS, but tactically controlled (TACON) by the AFOSI detachment. JDET members are considered part of S2I. 4.1.1.  An  official  MOA  between  the  local  AFOSI  field  unit  commander  or  SAIC  and  the DFC, outlining personnel numbers and caseload, must be established and reviewed annually. A  copy  must  be  submitted  for  Major  Command  Security  Forces  Director  (MAJCOM/A7S) review. No additional SF manpower will be earned for JDET support. (T-1) 4.2.  Field Testing Controlled Substances.  If specifically trained (i.e., MPI, other formal drug course(s) or localized training), SF can field-test suspected illegal narcotics. Contact AFOSI if a suspected substance tests positive for an illegal substance. (T-1) 4.2.1.  SF  investigators/detectives  can  obtain  field-test  kit  training  from  their  local  AFOSI detachment or through local civilian law enforcement agencies. Annotate the training on the AF Form 623A, On-The-Job Continuation Sheet. This training is a one-time requirement and does not need to be re-accomplished. Once trained, a member may train other personnel on how to properly conduct field-tests. 4.2.1.1.  Training  in  field-testing  for  narcotics  must  address  reading  and  recording  of results, safety practices and environmental considerations. 4.2.2.  S2I  will  notify  the  local  AFOSI  detachment  anytime  they  are  conducting  a  drug related investigation. (T-1) 4.3.  Polygraph  Support.  Only  AFOSI  can  conduct  polygraph  examinations  in  support  of  SF investigations. Request polygraph support in accordance with guidelines outlined in AFI 71-101, volume I. HQ AFOSI/XRZP is the office responsible to approve this support. 4.4.  Technical  Surveillance  Equipment.  AFOSI  is  the  sole  USAF  agency  authorized  to conduct  interceptions  of  communications  for  law  enforcement  purposes  as  outlined  in  DODD 5505.9,  Intercept  of  Wire,  Electronic  and  Oral  Communication  for  Law  Enforcement,  and  AFI 71-101,  volume  I.  This  prohibition  does  not  affect  administrative  telephone  monitoring  and recording  (i.e.,  taping  of  all  calls  terminating  at  the  BDOC),  closed  circuit  television  for monitoring personnel  entry into USAF restricted or controlled areas, monitoring confinees in  a corrections facility or overt video or audio equipment installed in a marked patrol vehicle. 4.4.1.  S2I may engage in overt still photographic and video surveillance as long as the audio pickup on all equipment is disabled. Before engaging in any surveillance operation, the DFC must review the surveillance plan and consult with the local SJA to ensure privacy concerns are  addressed.  If  there  is  a  need  to  use  either  photographic  or  video  equipment  covertly, assistance  must  be  obtained  from  AFOSI.    Per  AFPD  71-1,  Criminal  Investigations  and   22  AFI31-115  10 NOVEMBER 2014 Counterintelligence, AFOSI is the sole Air Force agency authorized to conduct covert video and photographic surveillance activities. (T-1) 4.4.2.  S2I  is  authorized  to  use  overt  video  equipment  with  the  audio  pickup  enabled  to document crime scenes, accident scenes, line ups and interview sessions. Coordinate the use of video equipment with audio pickup through the local SJA to ensure privacy concerns are addressed. Entrance to  interview rooms or any other office space under surveillance should be marked with posted signs that state: “Attention: All persons are subject to audio and video monitoring and/or recording while in this facility.” (T-1) 4.5.  Information  Technology  (IT)  Support.  Email addresses may mask the rank by allowing the identification  as  Investigator or Detective as  appropriate. Non-investigative correspondence and official paperwork will still reflect the military investigator member’s rank in the signature block. AFI31-115  10 NOVEMBER 2014   23  Chapter 5 CONDUCTING INVESTIGATIONS 5.1.  Interviews.  Conduct  Interviews IAW AFI 31-118. The AF Form 3985, Interview Record, may be used by investigators/detectives to note a suspect’s desire to invoke their right to counsel. 5.2.  Line  ups.  Line up policy can vary depending upon jurisdiction, location and local policy. Contact the local SJA office for guidance about line up procedures. 5.3.  Report  of  Investigation  (ROI)  (RCS:  DD-P&R(M)  1973).  There  are  two  forms  of documenting  investigative  results:  a)  AF  Form  3545A;  or  b)  a  formal  Report  of  Investigation. For  uniformity  in  reporting  under  the  Defense  Incident  Based  Reporting  System  (DIBRS), complete a report via SFMIS and attach the completed AF Form 3545A to all completed ROIs. If the  report  is  initiated  at  the  flight  level,  then  the  case  number  will  stay  the  same  as  the  initial report. Initiating a new case is the only time a new case number will be generated for a report. When writing an ROI, use the format in attachment 5 to maintain consistency with other DOD investigating  agencies.  When  a  formal  ROI  is  written,  only  the  background  and  synopsis  are required  on  part  IX  of  the  AF  Form  3545.  The  AF  Form  3545  will  include  the  following statement: “For additional information, refer to the Report of Investigation”. 5.3.1.  Cover  Sheet.  When  forwarding  completed  ROIs  and  AF  Forms  3545A  outside  SF channels,  cover  these  documents  with  an  AF  Form  445,  Security  Forces  Report  of Investigation  Cover  Sheet.  This  cover  sheet  draws  attention  to  the  report  and  the responsibility  on  the  part  of  the  recipient  to  protect  the  potentially  sensitive  information contained in the report. 5.3.2.  SF  Notes  and  Supporting  Documentation.  All  case  notes,  supporting  documentation and other case related material that are not an exhibit must be placed in  an AF Form 3987, Case File Documents Inner Envelope, to prevent them from getting lost and also keep them together. In order to restrict access to case notes to those with a need-to-know, seal and initial the  AF  Form  3987.  Once  complete,  place  the  AF  Form  3987,  AF  Form  3545,  ROI  and exhibits into the larger AF Form 3986, Case File Documents Outer Envelope, and submit to S5R. 5.3.3.  S2I must maintain accurate records of their investigations. All assignments requiring investigative  steps  must  be  recorded  in  chronological  order  and  monitored  from  date  of assignment until the date the ROI is submitted to S5R. 5.4.  Records  Checks.  SF  may  access  personnel,  Defense  Eligibility  Enrollment  Reporting System  (DEERS),  medical,  dental  and  financial  records  in  the  performance  of  official investigations. Investigators may use the AF Form 686, Substantive Investigations Record Check Summary,  to  collect  detailed  information  as  required  on  each  subject  during  the  investigation. Maintain this form with the completed ROI. (T-1) 5.5.  Release  of  Information.  AFI  51-201,  Administration  of  Military  Justice,  outlines  USAF policy  on  the  release  of  statements,  confessions  and  other  forms  of  information  relating  to criminal proceedings. Consult the local SJA for clarification if needed. 5.6.  Informants.  S2I  may  gather  information  through  the  use  of  informants.  When  used, establish  a  central  informant  information  file.  Maintain  complete  security  over  this  file  by   24  AFI31-115  10 NOVEMBER 2014 securing it in a locked file cabinet and limit access to only the SF investigator/detective and the DFC,  or  as  directed  by  court  order.  The  DFC  and  lead  SF  investigator/detective  will  brief  the host installation commander on the nature, scope and purpose of the S2I informant program. The briefing will be documented and retained within the S2I office. (T-2) the  SF for  any investigator/detective 5.6.1.  Instructions  will  be  given  to  the  informant  to  ensure  they  know  when  and  how  to contact type  of  emergency.  The  SF investigator/detective  should  also  know  when  and  how  to  contact  their  informant.  All informants’  training  will  be  documented  in  the  informant  file.  The  informant  will  be  given specific instructions and training before any tasks are given. They will be briefed on all safety precautions, what to do in an emergency and their limitations. The SF investigator/detective will ensure the informant understands the difference between providing an opportunity for a suspect to violate the law versus providing the inspiration. They will additionally be trained on the law regarding entrapment. Contact the local SJA prior to conducting a non-custodial interview if any questions concerning the suspect’s status exists. (T-2) 5.6.2.  Generally, the defense of entrapment exists when the design or suggestion to commit the offense originated with the government and the accused had no predisposition to commit the  offense.  The  “government”  includes  agents  of  the  government  and  individuals cooperating with the government, such as informants. The fact that individuals acting for the government  afford  opportunities  or  facilities  for  the  commission  of  an  offense  does  not constitute  entrapment.  Entrapment  occurs  when  the  criminal  conduct  is  the  product  of  the creative activity of government law enforcement agency activities. If there is concern about entrapment, contact the local SJA office. 5.6.3.  Maintain  all  known  information  on  informants,  including  their  background,  current and  previous  occupation(s),  attitude  and  motivation  for  cooperation,  criminal  record  (if applicable),  reliability  and  data  on  each  case  for  which  the  informant  has  provided information. Also maintain information on each contact with the informant. This includes the time and place of each  contact,  individuals present,  information  provided by the informant, direction  or  tasking  given  by  the  SF  investigator/detective  and  money  spent,  if  any,  for  the information  provided.  When  documenting  information  on  informants,  use  the  format  in attachment  6.  Ensure  preapproval  is  received,  in  writing,  from  the  DFC  prior  to  any expenditure  of  funds  while  working  confidential  informants.  Request  reimbursement  for expenditures as outlined in paragraph 2.7. (T-2) 5.6.4.  The  informant  file,  because  of  its  confidential  nature,  is  exempt  from  Non-Inspector General Inspections unless specifically authorized by the DFC. 5.6.5.  Contact  AFOSI  if  an  informant  desires  to  provide  information  for  financial  gain, provides information not in the investigative purview of SF or has access to criminal activity that could result in them being threatened or harmed. 5.6.6.  S2I  will  provide  AFOSI  the  name  and  unit  of  potential  informants  prior  to recruitment. S2I will also brief OSI on the nature of the criminal investigation in which each informant  is  being  or  will  be  used  and  any  additional  information  requested  by  OSI.  On  at least  a  monthly  basis,  or  more  often  if  requested,  S2I  will  provide  updated  informant information to OSI to eliminate conflicts. Should the local OSI field unit commander/SAIC disagree  with  S2I’s  intent  to  recruit  an  individual  as  an  informant,  he/she  will  discuss  the matter with the DFC to seek resolution. S2I will not pursue recruitment if the OSI field unit AFI31-115  10 NOVEMBER 2014   25  CC/SAIC indicates either to do so would interfere with an OSI investigation/operation or the informant  is  currently  working  on  behalf  of  OSI  or  another  federal  agency.  Should  the informant  provide  information  on  crimes  within  OSI’s  investigative  responsibility,  S2I  will refer  the  matter  to  OSI  and  will  work  with  OSI  to  secure  the  informant’s  cooperation.  OSI will subsequently apply its rules governing the handling of informants. 5.7.  Field Interview Data.  AF Form 3907, Security Forces Field Interview Data, will be used to  record  interactions  with  suspicious  individuals  and  people  being  interviewed  as  part  of  the investigative process in the field. Data obtained from the AF Form 3907 should be compared by S2I  against  reported  criminal  activity  to  obtain  possible  leads.  Refer  to  S5R  section  for disposition. 5.8.  Defense  Clearance  and  Investigations  Index  (DCII).  The  purpose  of  indexing  a participant  (Subject  and  Deceased)  or  entity  (company)  in  DCII  is  to  ensure  that  pertinent information  contained  in  an  ROI  is  retrievable  during  future  law  enforcement  or  security inquiries.  AFOSI  is  the  designated  agency  for  the  USAF  to  enter  and  retrieve  data  from  DCII. Further information can be found in AFI 31-118.  NOTE: AFOSI is responsible for indexing the participants of SF investigations into DCII IAW the indexing standard described in Department of Defense Instruction (DODI) 5505.7, Titling and Indexing Subjects of Criminal Investigations in the Department of Defense. 5.8.1.  The  SF  investigator/detective  is  responsible  for  providing  complete  and  accurate identifying information for each participant that must be indexed. The local S5R will provide AFOSI with all original documents for indexing and archiving. (T-0) 5.8.2.  Searching.  The  DCII  has  a  central  file  search  and  retrieval  capability.  SF investigators/detectives may request searches of DCII through their local AFOSI detachment. This search discloses any DOD investigative files on individuals. Such searches may provide valuable in  ongoing investigations or individuals considered for use as informants. leads  and  background  on investigative individuals involved 5.8.2.1.  DCII search results only shows case file numbers and the status of the person as associated with  the file (subject,  victim or incidental). A DCII  file number may show a person  as  a  ‘subject’  of  a  file,  but  the  file  may  only  pertain  to  a  counterintelligence polygraph, a background investigation or other activities. The presence of a file number may  not  be  a  direct  indication  that  a  person  has  been  or  is  currently  involved  in  actual criminal activity. Upon S2I’s request, the local AFOSI detachment may search additional federal agency databases as needed to provide more information. 5.8.3.  Indexing.  S5R  will  provide  originals  of  all  completed  ROIs,  AF  Forms  3545A  and USDCVN 1805, United States District Court Violations Notice, for crimes meeting the DCII indexing  standard  IAW  DODI  5505.7,  to  the  local  AFOSI  detachment.  AFOSI  will  be responsible for the filing and storage of these documents. S5R will be responsible to answer any Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests made concerning these reports until AFOSI has taken complete control of the case and a copy of the report is no longer available. (T-0) 5.8.4.  SF  will  only  utilize  AFOSI  to  index  in  DCII  until  the  capability  is  developed  into SFMIS.   26  AFI31-115  10 NOVEMBER 2014 5.9.  Financial  Investigations.  Refer  to  DODI  5400.15,  Guidance  on  Obtaining  Information from  Financial  Institutions,  for  the  DOD  policy  on  gaining  access  to  financial  records maintained by financial institutions. 5.10.  Investigation of Sexual Misconduct.  See attachment 2 of AFI 71-101, volume 1, for the types of sexual misconduct cases S2I may investigate. 5.10.1.  Misconduct  allegations  brought  to  SF  against  DOD  civilian  and  military  personnel involving  only  adult  private  consensual  sexual  acts  will  be  referred  by  SF  to  an  action authority  (normally  the  suspect’s  commanding  officer  or  supervisory  chain  of  command), unless  the  consensual  sexual  acts  involve  an  authority  figure  as  defined  in  AFI  71-101, volume 1. AFOSI investigates unprofessional relationships involving an authority figure and either  vaginal  intercourse,  oral  or  anal  sodomy,  penetration  of  the  vagina  or  anus,  or  the fondling of the genitalia or female breasts, in violation of Article 92. (T-2) 5.10.1.1.  An  action  authority  evaluates  allegations  involving  only  adult  private consensual  sexual  misconduct  according  to  DODI  5505.8,  Investigation  of  Sexual Misconduct  by  the  Defense  Criminal  Investigative  Organizations  and  Other  DOD  Law Enforcement Organizations. Action authorities normally act on such allegations without the investigative services of AFOSI or S2I. 5.11.  Sex Crimes.  Refer to AFI 71-101, volume 1, attachment 2, to determine whether OSI or S2I  has  investigative  responsibility  for  a  specific  offense.  Security  Forces  will  not  investigate Sexual Assaults IAW AFI 71-101, volume 1. 5.12.  Fingerprinting Suspects under Investigation.  Refer to AFI 31-118. 5.13.  DNA Collection Requirement for Criminal Investigations.  Refer to AFI 31-118. 5.14.  Obtaining  Bad  Checks  from  Army  and  Air  Force  Exchange  Service  (AAFES).  SF investigators/detectives  may  obtain  copies  of  bad  checks  from  a  local  AAFES  via  the  Fraud Watch  program.  The  documentation  can  be  provided  by  either  loss  prevention  personnel  or management. 5.14.1.  If S2I receives a copy of a check, it may be placed in the case file as an exhibit. (T-1) 5.15.  Computer Crimes.  SF investigators/detectives may seize a government computer, laptop, Blackberry  or  other  electronic  device  upon  coordination  with  the  Information  Technology  (IT) section  of  the  suspect’s  unit  and  in  coordination  with  the  servicing  legal  office.  Seizure  of  the electronic  equipment  should  be  logged  via  AF  Form  52.  IAW  AFI  71-101,  volume  1,  AFOSI provides  computer  crime  investigative  expertise  for  all  investigations  in  which  computers  are used as a tool in the commission of a crime, may contain evidence of a crime or are the target of a  crime.  When  seizing  a  personal  computer, investigators  may  contact  AFOSI  for advice/assistance  if  necessary.  Agents  are  trained  to  prevent  loss  of  information  during  seizure and are armed with tools enabling them to identify and collect probative digital evidence. 5.15.1.  When seizing a government computer, investigators/detectives will photograph what is immediately displayed on the desktop (monitor) and unplug the computer from the power source.    DO  NOT  power  off  a  computer  as  this  will  write  to  files  on  the  computer.  When seizing  a  personal  computer  contact  AFOSI  for  assistance.  AFOSI  has  equipment  to  image the device preventing the loss of information. AFI31-115  10 NOVEMBER 2014   27  5.15.2.  Do not make any attempts to copy or view hard drives or cell phones associated with computer  crimes  and  other  matters  AFOSI  investigates  per  attachment  2  of  AFI  71-101, volume 1. Refer the allegation to AFOSI. S2I must also immediately notify AFOSI when it is determined  a  computer  has  been  used  to  commit  a  crime  falling  within  S2I’s  investigative responsibility. 5.15.3.  If  S2I  requires  assistance  for  computer  crimes,  contact  the  local  AFOSI  office, Defense  Computer  Forensics  Laboratory  (DCFL)  or  coordinate  via  MOA/Memorandum  of Understanding (MOU) with local civilian crime lab. 5.16.  Fatal  Vehicle  Accidents.  Fatal  vehicle  accidents  without  suspected  homicide  or  suicide are investigated by a certified traffic investigator. Due to the extreme nature of the accident, S2I may  assist  the  traffic  investigator.  For  further  information  on  accidents  refer  to  AFI  31-218(I), Motor  Vehicle  Traffic  Supervision,  and  AFMAN  31-116,  Air  Force  Motor  Vehicle  Traffic Supervision. 5.17.  Crime Scene Investigations.  There is no steadfast rule that can be applied to defining the dimensions  of  a  crime  scene.  Every  crime  scene  is  dynamic,  so  the  information  following  is  a rule  of  thumb  to  assist  investigators  with  decision  making.  Valuable  physical  evidence  is normally  found  at  or  near  the  site  where  the  most  critical  action  was  taken  by  the  criminal against  the  victim  or  property.  Crime  scene  processing  is  important  because  it  meets  legal requirements concerning evidence when the SF investigator/detective can identify each piece of evidence,  describe  the  exact  location  of  the  item,  indicate  when  the  item  was  collected,  and maintain  and  demonstrate  proper  chain  of  custody.  The  SF  investigator/detective  or  a  trained crime laboratory technician must also describe changes that may have occurred in the evidence between the time it was collected and its introduction as evidence before the court. 5.17.1.  Assess  the  Scene.  Crime  scene  assessment  is  necessary  to  allow  the  SF investigator/detective in  charge to  determine the  type of incident  to be investigated and the level  of  investigation  to  be  conducted.  Plan  accordingly  for  the  coordinated  identification, collection  and  preservation  of  physical  evidence,  and  for  the  identification  of  witnesses. During  the  scene  assessment,  an  exchange  of  information  between  law  enforcement personnel  can  occur.  Immediately  upon  notification,  document  the  time,  date  and  incident. Upon  arrival,  document  the  time  and  weather  conditions.  The  SF  investigator/detective  in charge  identifies  specific  responsibilities,  shares  preliminary  information  and  develops investigative plans according to USAF policies, federal, state, local laws and the laws of the host nation when applicable. 5.17.1.1.  Evaluate  search  and  seizure  issues  to  determine  the  necessity  of  obtaining consent  to  search  and/or  the  requirement  of  obtaining  a  search  authority  on  a  base  or installation. 5.17.1.2.  Evaluate  and  establish  a  path  of  entry  and  exit  to  the  scene  to  be  used  by authorized  personnel,  such  as  medical,  Hazardous  Material  (HAZMAT)  and  other  law enforcement agencies, if not already accomplished by first responders. 5.17.1.3.  Determine  and  prioritize  the  number  and  size  of  the  scenes.  Establish  and maintain communication with first responders when multiple scenes exist. 5.17.1.4.  Determine  and  request  additional  investigative  resources  as  required,  such  as personnel, specialized units, legal consultation, prosecutors and equipment.   28  AFI31-115  10 NOVEMBER 2014 5.17.1.5.  Ensure  witnesses,  suspects  and/or  victims  to  the  incident  are  identified  and separated. 5.17.1.6.  Ensure the surrounding area is canvassed and the results documented. 5.17.1.7.  Ensure the preliminary documentation, such as notes, photographs and sketches of the scene, is complete. The initial photographs should include any injured individuals and vehicles involved in the incident. 5.17.2.  Crime Scene Photographs. The crime scene is photographed as soon as possible and before any evidence is disturbed. Photographs are not a substitute for crime scene sketches. All  photographs  are  documented  in  a  photograph  log  with  camera  positions  indicated  on  a sketch.  The  crime  scene  photograph  log  records  the  photograph,  describes  the  type  of photograph, the precise photograph location and the identifying data recorded as each shot is taken. Base alert photographers may be used with S2I accompanying to ensure proper photos are captured. 5.17.2.1.  One of the most important elements in investigative photography is maintaining perspective.    Photographs  must  reproduce  the  scene  as  it  would  appear  to  someone standing  in  the  photographer’s  shoes  with  the  same  impression  of  relative  position  and size  of  visible  objects.  Any  significant  distortion  in  perspective  will  reduce,  or  destroy altogether, the evidentiary value of the photography. 5.17.2.2.  Photograph evidence before recovery. 5.17.2.2.1.  Ensure that a progression of overall, medium and close-up photographs of any objects of evidence are taken. 5.17.2.3.  Photograph  the  interior  crime  scene  using  a  series  of  overlapping  360° photographs and a wide-angle lens. 5.17.2.4.  Photograph the exterior crime scene establishing the location of the scene by a series  of  overall  photographs  including  landmarks.  Photographs  should  have  360° coverage. 5.17.2.4.1.  Consider aerial photography to capture large areas, roads and other means of  approach  or  departure.  Coordinate  with  the  installation  photography  office  on proper aerial-photography techniques. 5.17.2.5.  All  evidence  should  be  photographed  three  times.
