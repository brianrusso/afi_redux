Purpose. This instruction describes the set of performance management indicators, and associatedreporting requirements, necessary to indicate successful accomplishment of the mission of the UnitedStates Air Force Academy (USAFA), as set forth in AF Policy Directive 36-35, United States Air ForceAcademy. 1.2.  AFI Organization. Individual sets of measures, both in aggregate and alone, are designed to provideinsight into one of the four major areas identified in AFPD 36-35 United States Air Force Academy: Char-acter Development, Educational Development, Leadership Development, and Physical Development. Thesets of measures are designed to provide insight into admissions, the performance of the preparatoryschool and general governance of the USAFA. 1.3.  Reporting Requirements. The unique reporting requirements, goals and thresholds are presentedwithin each chapter, along with the appropriate performance measures. In addition, the goals and thresh-olds associated with each measure are listed in Appendix A of this AFI. Reporting is on primarily an aca-demic year (AY) basis, and reports are required quarterly, by semester, or annually. The total list ofreporting requirements by time is listed in Chapter 9 of this AFI. 1.3.1.  Delegation of Performance Management. Individual measures will be managed by USAFAto the pre-established thresholds. Any time a measure is not within the threshold at the requiredreporting time, USAFA will submit the corresponding raw data (in addition to the pictorial graph/chart) for that measure at that reporting period. The submittal will only indicate that the measure waswithin the threshold. This reporting procedure will not apply to the following measures:                   - Measure 3C1 Sexual Assault Allegations                   - Measure 3D Cadet Incident Report                   - Measure 3E Cadet Climate Survey                   - Measure 5E Graduate Active Duty Performance                   - Measure 7D Permanent Party Climate Survey                   - The Summary-at-a-Glance Report 1.4.  Procedures. All data will be collected based upon the Academic Year (Graduation – Graduation)except as required due to special circumstances that dictate a distinctive reporting period to properlypresent required information. USAFA will collect and analyze the data required by each of the perfor-mance measures, and submit both the pictorial graphs/charts (Para 1.8.) for each measure and the Sum-mary-at-a-Glance Report (Chapter 9) to AF/DPLA. Several measures have predetermined thresholds thatwill require immediate notification of HAF if they are breached. Any time submittal does not meet orexceed the established goal for a given measure USAFA will include an explanation as to why the goalwas not met, and a description of any appropriate corrective action plan. 1.5.  Assessment Reports. USAFA will submit an annual Academy Assessment Report covering theAcademy and the Academy Preparatory School to AF/DPLA no later than 10 November of each year that6AFI36-3502   10 MARCH 2005complies with DoDD 1322.22 Section 6, para 6.1, Academy Assessment Report and para 6.2 PreparatorySchool Assessment Report. 1.6.  USAFA Oversight. This Performance Management Program will not limit the flow of informationbetween USAFA and HAF. USAFA may supplement the information required by this AFI with any dataUSAFA leadership deems is necessary. Conversely, submittal of the information required by this AFIdoes not eliminate the requirement for USAFA to respond to requests for information from elements ofUSAFA Oversight, such as the General Officer Steering Committee, the Executive Steering Group, theBoard of Visitors, SAF/MR or AF/DP. The complete oversight structure for USAFA is described in AFI36-3501 Headquarters Air Force Leadership Guidance for the United States Air Force.  1.7.  Demographics. Demographics are considered in monitoring the results of Air Force leaderships’efforts to enhance performance, sustain excellence in each of the Air Force’s core competencies, and toidentify indicators of potential personnel concerns. 1.8.  Presentation of Performance Measure Data. Data from each performance measure will be pre-sented in the form of pictorial graphs/charts. The graphs/charts will be created and portrayed in a mannerthat best illustrates what the performance measure was designed to ascertain. To ensure accurate units ofcomparison, particularly when the base group is susceptible to change, use rates per thousand rather thancomparing raw total numbers. To ensure each performance measure provides a broad enough comparison,include a bar (or other graphic illustration) in each graph/chart that represents an average of the precedingyears. The ideal average would capture the previous ten years however, at a minimum capture the averageof the previous four-years, when available. AFI36-3502   10 MARCH 20057Chapter 2     ADMISSIONS MEASURES 2.1.  Purpose. Maintain a set of performance measures by which the Academy and Air Force leadershipcan assess the incoming class of cadets to maximize the Academy’s effectiveness in attracting talentedapplicants from all segments of society and admitting outstanding young men and women who possessthe potential to excel during the Academy four year experience and graduate as commissioned officers inservice of the Air Force and the nation.

Purpose. Maintain a set of performance measures by which the Academy and AF leadership canassess the progress of cadet character development: 3.1.1.  Maintaining a Cadet Honor Code that establishes in each cadet a sense of personal integrity thatwill serve as the cornerstone for a life of dedication to our country. 3.1.2.  Developing in each cadet a standard of values and those qualities and skills, such as a strongsense of honor, duty, integrity, moral-ethical strength, intellectual interests, discipline, strength ofcharacter, the ability to maintain equitable relationships within a diverse workforce, and the ability tobuild and maintain trust, individually and organizationally, necessary to progressive and continuingdevelopment as a person of integrity and a professional military leader. 3.1.3.  Teaching cadets that loyalty to the values of the institution of the Air Force must be placedabove loyalty to any individual or peers. Commissioning only officers of integrity and outstandingmoral character. The following performance measures will be used: 3A1 Honor Cases by Wing 3A2 Honor Cases by Class 3A3 Annual Honor Probation Outcomes 3B Cadet (MEO) Military Equal Opportunity Cases by Category 3C1 Cadet Sexual Assault Allegations 3C2 Sexual Assault Report Formal vs. Confidential 3D1 Cadet Incident Report 3D2 Unfavorable Information File (UIF) Status 3E Cadet Climate Survey Results 3F Interactive Learning 3G Prevention and Awareness Training 3.2.  Performance Measurement Area: Honor System. The number of cadet honor violations is oneindicator of character development within the Cadet Wing. Note: To ensure data is not misleading,USAFA will include the total number of cadet offenders (i.e. one cadet may commit multiple infractions)and the total number of adjudicated incidents of misconduct where formal action was taken (i.e. allega-tions vs. confirmed incidents). 3.2.1.  Performance Measure 3A1: Honor Cases--By Wing. This measure presents the number ofhonor cases as defined in the Air Force Cadet Wing Honor Code Reference Handbook and USAFAI36-168. USAFA will present data from the previous 3 years to show a 4-year trend. 3.2.1.1.  Reporting Requirements. USAFA will be required to collect, analyze and submit thisdata quarterly and annually. The annual submittal will present annual totals, and be submitted NLT30 days after the end of the spring semester. 10AFI36-3502   10 MARCH 20053.2.1.2.  Threshold. The threshold is: Total violations >2% of the cadet population. (Note: atrend of low or no violations could be an indication of tolerance.) 3.2.1.3.  Rationale. This measure may indicate negative or positive trends in character develop-ment. 3.2.2.  Performance Measure 3A2: Honor Cases--By Class. This measure presents the number ofmonthly honor cases (e.g. violations, probations, disenrolled, other) for each class. USAFA willpresent data from the previous 3 years to show a 4-year trend. 3.2.2.1.  Reporting Requirements. USAFA will be required to collect, analyze and submit thisdata monthly and annually. The annual submittal will present annual totals, and be submitted NLT30 days after the end of the Spring Semester. 3.2.2.2.  Thresholds. The thresholds are: Fourth-Class violations >2% of the class population;First, Second, and Third Class violations >1% of the class population. (Note: A trend of low or noviolations could be an indication of tolerance.) 3.2.2.3.  Rationale. This measure will indicate negative or positive trends in Honor Code viola-tions. 3.2.3.  Performance Measure 3A3: Honor Probation Outcomes--By Wing. This measure com-pares the number of wing honor probation outcomes in the following category: unsuccessful proba-tion completion. USAFA will present data from the previous 7 years with each report to show an8-year trend. 3.2.3.1.  Reporting Requirements. USAFA will be required to collect, analyze and submit thisdata annually, NLT 30 days after the end of the Spring Semester. 3.2.3.2.  Goals and Thresholds. The goal for this measure is: >95% successful completion. Thethreshold is: When successful probations are <80% of the number of cadets on probation. 3.2.3.3.  Rationale. This measure will indicate negative or positive trends in regarding the reha-bilitative effect of probation. 3.3.  Performance Measurement Area: Cadet MEO Case. MEO cases reflect the degree to whichUSAFA cadets maintain equitable relationships within a diverse workforce and adhere to Air Force poli-cies concerning discrimination. 3.3.1.  Performance Measurement 3B: Cadet MEO Cases--By Category. This measure comparesallegations and substantiated cases of sexual harassment and unlawful discrimination in the followingcategories: race, gender, national origin, color, and religion. USAFA will present data from the previ-ous 3 years to show a 4-year trend. Note: USAFA will include the number and nature of sexual harass-ment allegations and substantiated cases that required the involvement by the Academy ResponseTeam (i.e. as a supplement to MEO involvement); as well as including all cadet complaints, even if theperson(s) complained of are faculty and staff or other Air Force personnel. 3.3.1.1.  Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected, analyzed, and reported both quarterly,and annually. The annual submittal will present annual totals and be submitted NLT 30 days afterthe end of the Spring Semester. 3.3.1.2.  Threshold. The threshold is: >0 MEO cases. (Note: A trend of low or no violationscould be an indication of tolerance.) AFI36-3502   10 MARCH 2005113.3.1.3.  Rationale. These indicators enhance leaderships’ ability to increasingly narrow theirfocus until root causes of perceptions of personnel are properly identified and addressed. Leader-ship also gains invaluable insight about USAFA’s culture and environment from the cadets’ per-spective. 3.4.  Performance Measurement Area: Cadet Sexual Assault Allegations. The numbers of allegedsexual assaults are one indication of USAFA cadets’ maintenance of equitable relationships within adiverse workforce and adherence to Air Force policies concerning sexual assault. 3.4.1.  Performance Measure 3C1: Cadet Sexual Assault Allegations--By Wing. This  measureincludes the number and nature of sexual assaults alleged each month by USAFA cadets and reportedto the Academy Response Team (ART). The ART shall confirm that their report includes all allega-tions reported to them during the relevant period by the Office of Special Investigations (OSI), Secu-rity Forces Squadron and any other non-confidential entity. This measure does not include anonymousor confidential reports to the Chaplains or to off-base organizations or any reports of sexual assaultthat occurred before the cadet arrived at the Academy. USAFA will present data from the previous 3years with each report to show a 4-year trend. Note: Distinguish between alleged perpetrators that arecadets, other alleged perpetrators associated with the Academy, and alleged perpetrators not associ-ated with the Academy (e.g., off-base civilians etc.). Also, clearly annotate and distinguish allegationsof sexual assault from command or judicial determinations that a sexual assault occurred (i.e. percep-tions vs. substantiated incidents). 3.4.1.1.  Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected, analyzed, and reported quarterly andannually. The annual submittal will present annual totals and be submitted NLT 30 days after theend of the spring semester. USAFA leadership will immediately notify the SecAF or CSAF anytime they become aware of an alleged sexual assault involving a cadet. 3.4.1.2.  Threshold. The threshold is: >0 allegations/month. (Note: a trend of low or no allega-tions could be an indication that victims are unwilling to report.) 3.4.1.3.  Rationale. This measure will indicate sexual assault allegation trends. 3.4.2.  Performance Measure 3C2: Sexual Assault Report: Formal vs. Confidential. This  mea-sure will reflect the number of sexual assault allegations made through confidential avenues comparedto sexual assault allegations made to non-confidential entities (including the Office of Special Investi-gations and Security Forces) and submitted as an aggregate report by the Academy Response Team(ART). This only includes reports of sexual assaults that occurred while the victim was a cadet.USAFA will present data from the previous 3 years with each report to show a 4-year trend. Note: Dis-tinguish between alleged perpetrators that are cadets, other alleged perpetrators associated with theAcademy, and alleged perpetrators not associated with the Academy (e.g., off-base civilians etc.).Also, clearly annotate and distinguish allegations of sexual assault from command or judicial determi-nations that sexual assault offenses occurred (i.e. perceptions vs. substantiated incidents). 3.4.2.1.  Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected, analyzed, and reported quarterly andannually. The annual submittal will present annual totals and be submitted NLT 30 days after theend of the spring Semester. USAFA leadership will immediately notify the SecAF or CSAF anytime they become aware of an alleged sexual assault involving a member of USAFA. 3.4.2.2.  Rationale. This measure will indicate to USAFA leadership a fuller picture of the healthof the formal and informal reporting systems. 12AFI36-3502   10 MARCH 20053.5.  Performance Measurement Area: Cadet Incident Report. The number of instances of cadet dis-cipline problems is one indication of the development of cadet character. 3.5.1.  Performance Measure 3D1: Cadet Incident Report. This measure will present the numberof instances of cadet discipline problems in the Cadet Wing in the following categories: assault,harassment, improper use of government network, drugs, destruction of private/ government property,theft/larceny, DUI/DWAI, providing alcohol to minors, false ID, underage drinking, other alcoholrelated incidents, “other” (e.g. any misconduct not otherwise stated that would be chargeable underthe UCMJ). Data will be displayed for each of the four quarters and will include annual totals in eachcategory. Note: To ensure data is not misleading, USAFA will include the total number of cadetoffenders (i.e. one cadet may commit multiple infractions) and the total number of adjudicated inci-dents of misconduct where formal action was taken.  3.5.1.1.  Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected, analyzed, and reported quarterly andannually. The annual submittal will present annual totals and be submitted NLT 30 days after theend of Spring Semester. 3.5.1.2.  Goals and Thresholds. The goal for this measure is: less than 1% of the cadet popula-tion per quarter. The threshold is: >2% of cadet population per quarter. 3.5.1.3.  Rationale. This measure will indicate negative and positive trends in cadet adherence toAir Force Core Values. 3.6.  Performance Measurement Area: Unfavorable Information Files. The number of UnfavorableInformation Files (UIFs) created on cadets every semester is an indicator of character development. 3.6.1.  Performance Measure 3D2: Unfavorable Information Files--By Class. This measure willpresent the number of UIFs created each year, by class. Trends regarding the character of the infrac-tions will also be included, by class, for insight into the nature of the cadet behaviors involved.USAFA will report significant trends from the previous 3 years, to show a 4-year trend. 3.6.1.1.  Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected, analyzed and reported NLT 30 daysfollowing the end of each semester. 3.6.1.2.  Goals and Thresholds. The goal for this measure is: <.2% of cadet population persemester. The threshold is: >.4% of the cadet population per semester. 3.6.1.3.  Rationale. This measure will indicate negative or positive trends in cadet adherence toAir Force Core Values and insight into the nature and patterns of inappropriate cadet behavior. 3.7.  Performance Measurement Area: Cadet Climate Survey. The  Survey  is  a  tool  to  enhanceUSAFA leaderships’ ability to rapidly identify and correct root causes of misperceptions or negative orga-nizational and interpersonal behaviors/conditions. Consequently, the indicators revealed by the Surveyrequire further exploration by USAFA leadership. The annual Cadet Climate Survey will be conductedIAW AFI 36-2601 and will assess multiple factors. USAFA will send raw data to AFPC/DPA for analysis.AFPC/DPA, in turn, will analyze, store, and submit the results to AF/DPLA. To ensure perceptions ofminorities are not overlooked, data should not be presented using an “80% positive – 20% negative rule”as a gauge (i.e. minority groups tend to make up less than 20% of the cadet population). Do not use per-centages (present the actual number of cadets/survey responses) when presenting data pertaining to zerotolerance policies (e.g. unlawful discrimination, hostile environment, sexual harassment/assault etc.).Include a sample of both positive and negative cadet comments with the statistical data for each categoryAFI36-3502   10 MARCH 200513of questions to enhance leadership insight into cadet perceptions. Provide root causes of misperceptionsor negative organizational and interpersonal behaviors/conditions identified after further exploration ofthe indicators, corrective measures taken, and the method leadership used to close the feedback loop withcadets. 3.7.1.  Performance Measure 3E: Cadet Climate Survey Results--By Year.  This measure will consist of the complete data and associated analysis from the annual cadet climatesurvey. 3.7.1.1.  Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected and reported to AFPC/DPA in rawform. AFPC/DPA will analyze and report results annually NLT 30 days after the end of the FallSemester. 3.8.  Performance Measurement Area: Interactive Learning Process. The effectiveness of the Centerfor Character Development (CCD) efforts are enhanced by character based instruction that permeates theUSAFA training spectrum and capitalizes on interactive learning processes designed to engage cadetsphysically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. 3.8.1.  Performance Measure 3F: Average Number of Hours--By Class. This measure presents ananalysis of cadet feedback, by class, pertaining to the degree CCD character based instruction perme-ates the USAFA training spectrum and capitalizes on interactive learning processes designed toengage cadets physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. 3.8.1.1.  Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected, analyzed, and reported annually NLT30 days following the end of the spring semester. 3.8.1.2.  Goals and Thresholds. The goal for this measure is: 100% of cadets engage in interac-tive character based learning processes each year. The threshold is: <90% of cadets receive 8hours of character-based instruction each year. 3.8.1.3.  Rationale. This measure will indicate negative or positive trends regarding the effective-ness of CCD’s approach to character development. It will provide USAFA leadership with a fullerpicture regarding the extent CCD permeates the USAFA training spectrum and capitalizes oninteractive learning processes that engage cadets physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. 3.9.  Performance Measurement Area: Sexual Assault Prevention, and Reporting. USAFA requiresannual cadet training on preventing and reporting sexual assault for cadets. 3.9.1.  Performance Measure 3G: Number of Hours for Instructor and Cadets. This  measurepresents the number of hours of training cadets receive annually, by class, and the number of hours oftraining each instructor receives annually. USAFA will present data from the 3 previous years to showa 4-year trend. 3.9.1.1.  Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected, analyzed, and reported annually NLT30 days following the end of the Spring Semester. 3.9.1.2.  Goals and Thresholds. The goal for this measure is: 3 hours per person. The thresholdis: <90% of either cadets or instructors receive <3 hours of training in a year. 3.9.1.3.  Rationale. This measure will indicate negative or positive trends in annual training. 14AFI36-3502   10 MARCH 2005Chapter 4     EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT MEASURES 4.1.  Purpose. Maintain a set of performance measures by which the Academy and AF leadership canassess the progress of the educational development of cadets. The following performance measurementswill be used to collectively indicate the degree to which USAFA cadets are developing educationally andmaximize USAFA effectiveness in: 4.1.1.  Providing a broad education in the arts and sciences leading to a Bachelor of Science degree. 4.1.1.1.  Orienting, structuring, and maintaining the core academic curriculum, as well as require-ments associated with academic majors, to emphasize mastery of the scientific and technical sub-jects in order to develop Air Force officers who can conceptualize, acquire, test, deliver andsustain new and innovative technologies. 4.1.1.2.  Developing future Air Force officers with international insight, foreign language profi-ciency, and the cultural understanding to meet the requirements of the expeditionary air and spaceforce concept. For those cadets who pursue degrees in the humanities and social sciences, observestringent requirements for the study of foreign languages. 4.1.1.3.  Fostering in each cadet, in the prescribed subject areas, the acquisition of knowledge thatfocuses on mastery of reasoning processes, clarity of expression, the ability to make sound deci-sions, and the ability to weigh, integrate, and apply such knowledge and skills to problems ofnational security and military operations. 4.1.2.  Motivating cadets to seek and excel in initial assignments as operational professionals perform-ing the front line warfighting mission of the Air Force before branching off into non-combat relatedfunctional career fields. 4.1.3.  Developing within each cadet, a thorough understanding of, respect for, and full and active sup-port of military to civilian relationships inherent in military service.

Processing  time  of  honorcases is one indicator of the governance of the Honor System. The goal is 60-days total processing fromthe time, after clarification, that a cadet is alleged to have violated the honor code until the case is com-pleted. Completion is defined as the time when final decision is reached by the appropriate USAFAauthority. 7.3.1.  Performance Measure 7B: Honor Cases Processing Times--By Wing. This measure pre-sents the average processing time of honor cases each month, as well as a summary of every case thatexceeded 90 days.  USAFA will present data from the 2 previous years to show a 3-year trend. NOTE: USAFA will also provide present the average processing time of disenrollment cases eachmonth. 7.3.1.1.  Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected, analyzed, and reported quarterly. Inaddition, USAFA will submit a monthly report to SAF/MRM showing any case currently over 90days along with an explanation for the excessive processing time, and a projection for completionof each case. If no honor cases exceed the 90-day limit, no monthly report to SAF/MRM isrequired. 7.3.1.2.  Goals and Thresholds. The goal for this measure is: all cases processed in ≤60 days.The threshold is: 1 or more cases taking ≥90 days to process. 7.3.1.3.  Rationale. This measure provides USAFA leadership with positive or negative trendsregarding the efficiency of the honor system. 7.4.  Performance Measurement Area: Faculty and Staff Demographics. Maintaining a healthy mixof backgrounds on the USAFA faculty and Staff could be important to the overall development of cadets. 7.4.1.  Performance Measure 7C: Faculty and Staff Demographics. This measure presents thepercent of the USAFA Faculty and Staff (excluding 10 ABW personnel) that are AFA graduates/non-AFA graduates, minorities (e.g. American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or AfricanAmerican, Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, Hispanic or Latino) /non-minorities, male/female, andrated/non rated, civilian faculty (not retired military)/civilian faculty (retired military). USAFA willpresent data from the 3 previous years to show a 4-year trend. 7.4.1.1.  Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected, analyzed, and reported NLT 30 daysfollowing the end of the Spring Semester. 7.4.1.2.  Rationale. This may indicate institutional issues warranting further analysis. 7.5.  Performance Measurement Area: Permanent Party Survey Results. One indication of the suc-cess of the governance of USAFA is the results of the annual survey of permanent party members. 7.5.1.  Performance Measure 7D: Permanent Party Climate Survey--By Year. This measure pre-sents the complete results and analysis for the annual permanent party survey. The survey is a tool toenhance USAFA leaderships’ ability to rapidly identify and correct root causes of misperceptions ornegative organizational and interpersonal behaviors/conditions. Consequently, the indicators revealedby the survey require further exploration by USAFA leadership. The annual climate survey will beconducted IAW AFI 36-2706. USAFA will send raw data to AFPC/DPA for analysis. AFPC/DPA, inturn, will analyze, store, and submit the results to AF/DPLA. To ensure perceptions of minorities arenot overlooked, data should not be presented using an “80% positive – 20% negative rule” as a gauge28AFI36-3502   10 MARCH 2005(i.e. minority groups (e.g. American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American,Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, Hispanic or Latino) tend to make up less than 20% of the popula-tion). Do not use percentages (present the actual number of cadets/survey responses) when presentingdata pertaining to zero tolerance policies (e.g. unlawful discrimination, hostile environment, sexualharassment/assault etc.). Include a sample of both positive and negative comments with statistical datafor each category of questions to enhance leadership insight into perceptions. Provide root causes ofmisperceptions or negative organizational and interpersonal behaviors/conditions identified after fur-ther exploration of indicators, corrective measures taken, and the method leadership used to close thefeedback loop with permanent party. 7.5.1.1.  Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected and reported to AFPC/DPA in rawform. AFPC/DPA will analyze and report results annually NLT 30 days after the end of the SpringSemester. 7.5.1.2.  Rationale. This measure may provide indicators that lead to root causes of mispercep-tions or negative organizational and interpersonal behaviors/conditions. It also may indicate theneed for adjustments in leadership's response to indicators. 7.6.  Performance Measurement Area: Voluntary Disenrollment. The desire of cadets to depart theAcademy of their own volition can be an indication of management of USAFA, and USAFA responses tovarious cases could provoke analysis that may identify issues not otherwise apparent. 7.6.1.  Performance Measure 7E: Voluntary Disenrollment--By Class. This measure presents theraw numbers for voluntary disenrollment, by class, and may include the former cadet’s rationale forleaving. 7.6.1.1.  Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected, analyzed, and reported annually. 7.6.1.2.  Rationale. This may indicate areas within USAFA requiring additional exploration. 7.7.  Performance Measurement Area: Medical Turn-back. In the course of the USAFA program,some cadets develop medical conditions affecting their ability to successfully participate in Academyactivities. Those cadets who desire to complete their education with USAFA but need time to recover areturned-back medically. The number of cadets in medical turn-back status and the reason why can be anindication of management of USAFA, and USAFA responses to various cases could provoke analysis thatmay identify issues not otherwise apparent. 7.7.1.  Performance Measure 7F: Medical Turn-back--By Reason. This measure presents rawnumbers of cadets who have been medically turned back, by reason for the turn back (injury, preg-nancy, etc.) 7.7.1.1.  Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected, analyzed, and reported annually NLT30 days following the end of the Spring Semester. 7.7.1.2.  Rationale. This may indicate areas within USAFA requiring additional exploration. 7.8.  Performance Measurement Area: Administrative Turn-back. In the course of completing therigors of the USAFA program, some cadets are administratively turned back. Those cadets who desire tocomplete their education with USAFA but need time to address other issues are turned-back administra-tively. The number of cadets in administrative turn-back status and the reason why can be an indication ofAFI36-3502   10 MARCH 200529management of USAFA, and USAFA responses to various cases could provoke analysis that may identifyissues not otherwise apparent. 7.8.1.  Performance Measure 7G: Administrative Turn-back--By Reason. This measure presentsraw numbers of cadets who have been administratively turned back, by reason for the turn back (fam-ily emergency, hardship, etc.) 7.8.1.1.  Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected, analyzed, and reported annually NLT30 days following the end of the Spring Semester. 7.8.1.2.  Rationale. This may indicate areas within USAFA requiring additional exploration. 7.9.  Performance Measurement Area: Significant Incident Reporting. It is imperative senior AirForce leaders are informed of significant incidents in a timely manner. 7.9.1.  Performance Measure 7H: Significant Incident Reporting. This  measure  presents  theamount of time that transpires when anyone in the USAFA chain of command becomes aware of asignificant incident until either the SecAF or CSAF have been notified. 7.9.1.1.  Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected, analyzed, and reported on a quarterlybasis. 7.9.1.2.  Rationale. This measure will indicate positive or negative trends in USAFA’s senior leader notification process. 7.10.  Performance Measurement Area: OSI Investigation Times. OSI investigations must be accom-plished in a timely manner to enhance USAFA leadership efforts to instill good order and discipline. 7.10.1.  Performance Measure 7I: OSI Investigation Times. OSI will track and report the elapsedtime from the moment OSI is notified of an incident that requires investigation until the report of theinvestigation is delivered to USAFA leadership. 7.10.1.1.  Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected, analyzed, and reported on an annualbasis. 7.10.1.2.  Rationale. This measure will indicate positive or negative trends in OSI investigation timeliness. 7.11.  Performance Measurement Area: Tour Lengths. USAFA tour lengths should be limited to pre-vent the Academy from being insulated from the operational Air Force and a broader range of experiencesand perspectives. This measure will include all Sequential Tour Officers (STO) and Permanent Profes-sors. 7.11.1.  Performance Measure 7J: Tour Lengths. This measure presents the number of enlistedpersonnel with over 4 years time on station and the number of officers with over 3 years time on sta-tion at USAFA. 7.11.1.1.  Reporting Requirements. Data will be collected, analyzed, and reported annually NLT30 days following the end of the Spring Semester. 7.11.1.2.  Rationale. This measure will indicate positive or negative trends regarding success ofmeasures to prevent USAFA from being insulated from the operational Air Force. 30AFI36-3502   10 MARCH 2005Chapter 8     USAFA PREPARATORY SCHOOL MEASURES 8.1.  Purpose. Maintain a set of performance measures by which the Academy and AF leadership canassess the accomplishment of the USAFA Preparatory School mission.
