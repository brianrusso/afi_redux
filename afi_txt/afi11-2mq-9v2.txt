References, Abbreviations, Acronyms, and Terms. See Attachment 1.  1.2.  Procedures.  1.2.1.  Standardization/Evaluation Flight Examiners (FEs) will use the evaluation criteria in thisinstruction for conducting all flight and emergency procedure evaluations. To ensure standard andobjective evaluations, flight examiners will be thoroughly familiar with the prescribed evaluation cri-teria. 1.2.2.  All evaluations fall under the Instrument (INSTM), Qualification (QUAL), Mission (MSN),Instructor (INSTR), or SPOT criteria in AFI 11-202V2. INSTM applies to pilots only. Schedule allevaluation activity to occur on one sortie to the greatest extent possible. 1.2.3.  FEs may use video recording (VR) devices to reconstruct/evaluate the mission. 1.2.4.  FEs will brief examinees on the evaluation purpose, conduct and the evaluation areas prior toflight. Examinees will accomplish required flight planning for the evaluation IAW requirements fortheir crew position. Examinees will furnish FEs a copy of necessary flight logs, target folders, andother required mission materials. 1.2.5.  FEs should not occupy a primary crew position during evaluations except when it would affordthe best opportunity to conduct INSTR evaluations. 1.2.6.  Areas required to complete an evaluation are indicated with an "R" on applicable evaluationcriteria tables. When a required area cannot be evaluated in flight, it will be evaluated by an AircrewTraining Device (ATD) or by oral examination in order to complete the evaluation. Document the useof alternate evaluation methods in the AF Form 8 comments section. If an alternate evaluation methodwas used in a flight evaluation required area, the next evaluation cannot use an alternate method forthat area 1.2.7.  FEs will thoroughly debrief all aspects of the flight. The debrief will include the examinee'soverall rating, specific deviations, area grades assigned (if other than qualified) and any recommendedadditional training. 1.3.  Grading Instructions. Performance standards are in AFI 11-202V2 and this instruction. 1.3.1.  FEs will compare examinee performance for each area accomplished during the evaluationwith the standards provided in this volume and assign an appropriate grade for the area. FEs willderive the overall flight evaluation grade from the area grades based on a composite for the observedevents and tasks IAW this volume. 1.3.2.  FEs will base tolerances for in-flight parameters on conditions of smooth air and a stable air-craft. Do not consider momentary deviations from tolerances provided the examinee applies promptcorrective action and such deviations do not jeopardize flying safety. FEs will consider cumulativedeviations when determining an overall grade. 1.3.3.  When grading criteria specify evaluation of airspeed and the flight manual lists only a mini-mum/maximum airspeed for that area, the examinee will brief the desired airspeed. AFI11-2MQ-9V2   15 APRIL 200851.3.4.  FEs must exercise judgment when the wording of areas is subjective and when specific situa-tions are not covered. 1.3.5.  An unqualified grade in any of the critical areas identified by this instruction requires an overallunqualified grade. 1.3.6.  FE judgment will be the determining factor in arriving at the overall grade. 1.3.7.  The following general criteria apply during all phases of flight except as noted for specificevents and instrument final approaches: 1.3.7.1.  Q:  1.3.7.1.1.  Altitude: +/-150 feet. 1.3.7.1.2.  Airspeed: +10/-5 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS). 1.3.7.1.3.  Course: +/-20 degrees/1.5 nautical miles (NM) (whichever is greater). 1.3.7.2.  Q-:  1.3.7.2.1.  Altitude: +/- 200 feet. 1.3.7.2.2.  Airspeed: +15/-7 KIAS. 1.3.7.2.3.  Course: +/-30 degrees/3 NM (whichever is greater). 1.3.7.3.  U: Exceeded Q- limits. 1.4.  Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE). FEs will use an ATD to conduct EPEs, if available andEPE capable. If not using an ATD, administer the EPE orally. This evaluation will include areas commen-surate with examinee's qualifications. 1.4.1.  Include the following items on all EPEs: 1.4.1.1.  Evaluate Pilots and Sensor Operators (SO) on general aircraft and mission systemsknowledge as required by their crew position. 1.4.1.2.  Evaluate at least two emergency procedures and all CAP per applicable phase of flight,eight emergency procedures minimum. Crewmembers will not be evaluated on events in whichthey are not specifically trained (e.g. pre-takeoff, takeoff, landing emergency procedures and asso-ciated CAP will not be evaluated unless conducting a QUAL for Launch and Recovery (L/R)).Units will publish a list of EPs for which crew are responsible IAW above direction. 1.4.1.3.  Evaluate crew coordination where applicable. 1.4.1.4.  Evaluate unusual attitude recoveries on all pilot EPEs. 1.4.2.  Tailor MSN evaluation scenarios to unit tasking and include areas not normally evaluated inflight. FEs should include the following additional items on the EPE given as a requisite to the mis-sion evaluation. 1.4.2.1.  Basic sensor systems operation. 1.4.2.2.  Safe passage procedures/threat avoidance. 1.4.3.  Unqualified EPE 6AFI11-2MQ-9V2   15 APRIL 20081.4.3.1.  Place examinees receiving an overall unqualified grade in supervised status until com-pleting recommended additional training and/or successfully accomplishing a reevaluation. 1.4.3.2.  Examinees receiving an overall unqualified grade because of unsatisfactory CAP accom-plishment will not be permitted to fly in their crew position until a successful reevaluation isaccomplished. 1.4.4.  Use the following grading criteria to grade individual items on EPEs: 1.4.4.1.  Q. Correct performance. Recognizes and corrects errors. 1.4.4.2.  Q-. Safe Performance, but limited in proficiency with errors of omission or commission. 1.4.4.3.  U. Performance is unsafe or indicates lack of knowledge or ability. 1.5.  Crew Resource Management (CRM).

General.  2.1.1.  Evaluation Procedures. All evaluations will follow the guidelines set in AFI 11-202V2 andthis volume. Before the mission briefing, the flight examiner will brief the examinee on specific eval-uation areas and, if applicable, will inform the pilot in command of any special requirements. Use cri-teria in the chapter for the appropriate crew position for evaluations. Units may modify evaluationprofiles based on local operating considerations or FE judgment to complete the evaluation. 2.1.2.  Evaluation Requirements.  2.1.2.1.  FEs must evaluate all required areas in order to complete the evaluation. 2.1.2.1.1.  Document use of alternate evaluation methods in the AF Form 8, Comments sec-tion. 2.1.2.1.2.  If the FE determines the required item cannot be adequately evaluated by an alter-nate method, the examinee will require an additional flight to complete the evaluation. 2.1.2.2.  An asterisk (*) indicates critical areas (1, 2, 3, 4). A grade of U awarded in any criticalarea requires an overall Q-3 for the evaluation. 2.1.2.3.  Grade all observed areas. 2.2.  Pilot Instrument Evaluation. A mission flown according to instrument flight rules (IFR) (to theextent practical) best fulfills the objective of the INSTM evaluation. The instrument flight phase will nor-mally be combined with the qualification flight phase. Units may elect to administer this evaluation onany compatible training mission or combined with the mission evaluation. (NOTE: For pilots not quali-fying in aircraft L/R operations, certain elements of the INSTM evaluation are not required provided theappropriate documentation is included on the AF Form 8, IAW Table 4.1.). Minimum ground phase req-uisites are: 2.2.1.  Instrument examination. 2.2.2.  CAP examination. 2.3.  Qualification Evaluation. A mission evaluating the examinee’s ability to safely and effectivelyoperate the aircraft and associated subsystems.

NOTE: Basic Mission Capable (BMC) crewmembers will only be evaluated on those missions routinelyperformed by the examinee. Evaluate only those areas in which they are qualified. 10AFI11-2MQ-9V2   15 APRIL 20082.5.  Formal Course Evaluation. Fly evaluations IAW syllabus mission profile guidelines or on a mis-sion profile developed from syllabus training objectives. Units may modify formal course guidelinesbased on local operating considerations or FE judgment to complete the evaluation. Grade training objec-tives and related areas using appropriate performance criteria. 2.6.  Instructor Evaluations.  2.6.1.  INSTR flight evaluations will include a thorough evaluation of knowledge, judgment, instruc-tor ability (including error analysis of student activity) and use of grading documents, as well as pro-ficiency in their crew specialty. During the initial INSTR evaluation the examinee must demonstratethe ability to instruct in some phase of the unit's mission. The instructional topic/area will be anno-tated in the comments section of the AF Form 8. Except for requirements delineated in Table 3.2., theflight examiner will determine specific profiles and/or events. Subsequent periodic evaluations (forexample, INSTM/QUAL, QUAL, or MSN) will include instructor portions during the evaluations. 2.6.1.1.  Instructors must demonstrate proficiency by instructing a student (or qualified individualacting as a student). The evaluator may require the examinee to present verbal explanations ofequipment operations, procedures, and techniques pertinent to crew duties and responsibilities. 2.6.1.2.  During any phase of the flight portion of the evaluation, the evaluator may require theexaminee to demonstrate (not instruct) and/or present verbal explanations of system operationsand/or procedures. Evaluators must ensure oral questions/instructions are clear, concise, pertinentto the individual's crew duties, and do not interfere with normal mission accomplishment. 2.6.2.  FEs may administer a periodic INSTR/MSN check on a Formal Training Unit (FTU) instructorduring a FTU training sortie. 2.6.3.  Periodic FTU INSTR checks conducted with a FTU student will comply with the student FTUevaluation requirements. 2.6.4.  An instructor receiving an area grade of U or Q- with additional training in any graded area willnot perform instructor duties until the required additional training is complete. This restriction will bewritten into the comments section and the restrictions block will be marked on the AF Form 8.
