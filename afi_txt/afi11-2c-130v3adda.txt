Sound  Judgment.  Instructions  in  this  AFI  are  mandatory  and  provide  the  best  possible operating instructions under most circumstances, but cannot account for every possible situation that  a  crewmember  may  encounter  during  contingency  operations.    During  these  times,  the loadmaster must use his/her sound judgment and operational  risk management to  meet  mission demands. 1.2.  General.  This  instruction  establishes  basic  cargo  compartment  configuration,  standard equipment, and location of such equipment aboard the C-130E(H)/H/(K)H/(L)H and WC-130H aircraft.  In order to meet HQ AF guidance toward conserving fuel, equipment will be removed to reduce the aircraft weight In Accordance With (IAW) Tables 2.1., 2.2., and 2.3.  Aircraft will not have tool boxes larger than the standard crew chief tool box, nor large garbage cans onboard the aircraft.  Some C-130 aircraft have additional approved equipment installed that may affect configuring the aircraft as listed.  For operational planning purposes, each configuration has an average time annotated and number of personnel to configure the airplane.  The times quoted are approximate  figures  and  are  configuration  times  only.    They  do  not  include  de-configuration times.  (For example, to reconfigure from a P-1 configuration, 92 sidewall and center aisle seats to a C-1 configuration (clean floor) requires more than one-half hour for one person, which is the time allocated to configure a C-1 configuration. 1.3.  Responsibility.  Operational  plans  must  consider  the  most  appropriate  configuration  that satisfies mission requirements and permits the minimum amount of variations and man-hours to change.    USAF  units  performing  services  on  the  C-130  aircraft  (i.e.,  maintenance,  aerial  port, and  aircrew  flight  equipment)  are  responsible  for  configuring  the  aircraft  IAW  this  instruction and as outlined in mission directives, to include the stowage/installation of the equipment IAW the  configuration  and  equipment  tables.    Maintenance  personnel  will  ensure  all  required  and mission specific equipment is positioned on the aircraft to meet mission requirements according to Tables 2.1 and 2.2. Some equipment listed in Table 2.2 is roll on/roll off equipment controlled by  unit  designated  personnel  (i.e.  CDS/EPJS  kits,  etc.).  Aircrew  Flight  Equipment  (AFE) personnel will ensure all life sustaining equipment is positioned on the aircraft to meet mission requirements according to Table 2.3. Before home station departure, maintenance personnel are responsible  for  configuring  the  aircraft  (including  modifications)  to  meet  mission  requirements in  accordance  with  Figures  3-1  thru  3-30.    For  the  CP-2  through  CP-5  configurations,  the sidewall seats will be stowed to facilitate preflight of the dual rails and then lowered by aircrew with maintenance assistance.  After departure from home station, the aircrew will accomplish all configurations  with  assistance  by  maintenance/aerial  port  personnel  if  available.    Aircrew personnel,  during  preflight,  will  ensure  required  mission  equipment  has  been  provided  and  is properly installed.  When the aircraft configuration is not completed prior to aircrew show time, the  loadmaster  will  assist  in  the  completion  of  the  configuration,  after  accomplishing  required pre-departure  duties  (i.e.,  preflight,  loading,  etc.).    Loadmasters  have  overall  responsibility  for configuration management and proper installation of equipment on the aircraft. 1.4.  Standard  Configuration  Codes.  Use the  following codes when referring to  C-130  cargo compartment configurations.  The number that identifies the configuration capability will follow 8 AFI11-2C-130V3ADDA  13 AUGUST 2009 the  letter  code  (i.e.,  TAC-2).  Standard  codes  for  items  listed  in  Table  2.2.,  Mission  Specific Equipment, are listed in Attachment 2. Use the codes when equipment is required for a specific mission type. 1.4.1.  A* - Armor Equipped Aircraft 1.4.2.  AE - Aeromedical Evacuation 1.4.3.  C - Cargo 1.4.4.  CP - Cargo and Passengers 1.4.5.  P - Passengers 1.4.6.  TAP - Tactical Airdrop Paratroop 1.4.7.  TAC - Tactical Airdrop Cargo 1.4.8.  WX - Weather 1.4.9.  NASA - National Aeronautics and Space Administration 1.5.  Modifications  .    Configuration  codes  of  this  instruction  may  require  modifications  for  a specific  mission.    Each  modification  must  be  carefully  evaluated  prior  to  mission  operation  to ensure maximum flight safety and compatibility with aircraft equipment.  Each mission directive will  identify  the  basic  configuration  by  code  and  the  modification,  if  necessary,  to  satisfy  the mission requirement.  For example, an aeromedical evacuation mission may require more litters than available in configuration AE-1.  Consult the appropriate configuration charts to determine at what location the desired additional litters can be installed and which seats must be removed.  Indicate  in  the  mission  directive,  by  position  (left  or  right,  and  number)  which  seats  are  to  be deleted and (by alphabetical position) the litter tier provisions to be installed; i.e., configuration AE-1(Mod), remove seats 12, 13, 14, and 15 left and right, install litter tier provisions C and D. 1.6.  Weight  and  Balance.  Configuration  equipment  and  necessary  supply  changes  affect aircraft weight and balance.  To standardize equipment and the location of the equipment, items shown in Table 2.1 will be included in the basic weight of the aircraft and remain on the aircraft except for maintenance and inspection.  Equipment listed in Tables 2.2 and 2.3 will be added as necessary and entered in references 5, 6, or 7 of DD Form 365-4, Weight and Balance Clearance Form  F-Transport/Tactical.  DD Form 365-4 will be completed IAW instructions in Chapter 5. When  the  fuel  load  is  unknown,  load  plan  for  a  20-22  percent  of  Mean  Aerodynamic  Chord (MAC)  zero  fuel.  NOTE:    The  addition  of  aircraft  defensive  systems,  armor,  and  other modifications produces an extreme forward CG which must be countered by adjusting the load center of balance within the range of F.S. 550 to F.S. 575. 1.7.  Revisions  .    To  recommend  changes,  conflicts,  suggestions,  or  recommendations  to departmental publications, use the AF Form 847 and route it through the publishing channels to the OPR for the publication. 1.8.  Aircraft  Configuration  Waivers  and  Supplements.  Follow  waiver  protocol  in  AFI  11-2C-130, Volume 3.  MAJCOMs forward approved requests to HQ AMC/A3V. AFI11-2C-130V3ADDA  13 AUGUST 2009 9 Chapter 2 CONSOLIDATED EQUIPMENT TABLES 2.1.  General  .  Configure all models of C-130 aircraft with the equipment listed in Table 2.1., Required  Equipment.    Items  listed  in  Table  2.2.,  Mission  Specific  Equipment,  are  added,  as necessary,  to  attain  a  specific  configuration/comply  with  mission  directives.  Configure  with standard quantities of aircrew flight equipment (AFE) IAW Table 2.3., Aircraft Installed Aircrew Flight Equipment Configuration. 2.1.1.  During  aircraft  contingency/deployment  generations,  it  is  imperative  aircraft  deploy with the full complement of AFE.  This equipment must be at forward operating locations to allow maximum  mission flexibility  when  aircraft are away  from  home station.  In the event installed  AFE  inspection  dates  expire  while  the  aircraft  is  on  alert  status  or  away  from operating  location,  place  these  items  in  the  AF  Form  781A  on  a  red  dash  until  the  aircraft goes off alert or returns to operating location. When aircraft is released from alert or returns to operating location, upgrade to a red X IAW TO 00-20-1. 2.2.  Aircrew Flight Equipment Aircraft Transfer Requirements.  When transferring aircraft; position  life  sustaining  equipment  IAW  permanent  transfer  configuration.    Losing  unit  will contact the gaining organization’s AFE section and initiate transfer of required aircraft-installed AFE  and  inspection  records.    The  gaining  organization  will  conduct  an  acceptance  inspection and  forward  a  copy  of  discrepancies,  to  include  any  equipment  shortages,  to  their  respective MAJCOM  IAW  TO  00-20-1.  Without  documented  coordination  and  approval,  do  not  transfer aircraft  with  less  than  the  required  equipment.    The  losing  organization  must  make  up  any shortages from on-hand assets to ensure transferring aircraft has required equipment. 2.3.  Aircrew  Flight  Equipment  Life  Sustaining  Equipment  Overhead  Racks.  Handle AFE with care to avoid damage to this life sustaining equipment.  AFE life sustaining equipment will always be placed in the overhead racks, unless stowed elsewhere for airplane CG limitations for all airplanes.  The primary purpose of all overhead racks is  for AFE life  sustaining equipment.  Other  items  of  equipment  placed  in  the  overhead  racks  must  not  interfere  with  AFE  life sustaining  equipment  and  be  easily  secured.    Oil,  hydraulic  fluid  or  other  liquids  will  not  be placed on the rack when AFE life sustaining equipment is installed. 2.4.  Aircraft Returning From Off station.  To minimize AFE reconfiguration time upon return from off station operations, crewmembers must return parachutes, kits, and AFE life sustaining equipment  to  their  primary  position  after  each  mission.  Upon  return  from  off  station  operations, AFE  personnel  will  ensure  the  aircraft  is  returned  to  local  training  configuration  at  earliest opportunity not to exceed five work days. Maintenance personnel will ensure any mission specific equipment is removed from the aircraft at earliest opportunity not to exceed five work days. The five work day rule does not apply if the aircraft will not be flown during that period. In this case the aircraft will be in the proper configuration prior to next flight. All added equipment will be removed; under  no  circumstances  will  an  aircraft  be  flown  in  a  partial  configuration.  EXCEPTION:    109 OG/CC  with  concurrence  of  theater  commander  may  tailor  the  equipment  onboard  LC-130 aircraft for polar missions. EXCEPTION:  OG/CCs with aircraft considered ―Restricted‖ due to center wing box cracks may remove equipment onboard to maximize local training requirements. Any removed equipment must be placed back onboard the aircraft before departing home station for a scheduled mission that may require the equipment. 10 AFI11-2C-130V3ADDA  13 AUGUST 2009 Table 2.1.

One EPOS per passenger/patient will be available regardless of planned flight altitude. EPOS do not have to be stationed at each seat, they may be placed throughout the cabin/cargo area so that any passenger/patient has quick access to oxygen regardless of where they are should loss of pressurization occur. 2.  One attached to the inboard seat belt mount of flight deck lower bunk and two stowed on parachute rack. 3.  Required for overwater flights. When parachutes are carried LPU-10/P quantities will match parachutes.  LPU-10/Ps are designed to integrate with AFE used by aircrew personnel.  A/C LPUs are not compatible and shall not be used with parachutes, survival vest, ABA, and Aircrew Eye Respiratory Protection System (AERPS). 4.  Four PBEs will be placed on the flight deck and two in the cargo compartment. 5.  Only required on contingency missions. 6.  Any unit scheduled to conduct operations above 78 degrees north or below 60 degrees south (IAW federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) Part 135, Part 135.98, Operations in the Polar Area and FAR Part 121, Appendix P, Requirements for ETOPS and Polar Operations) will configure the aircraft with the appropriate quantity of anti-exposure suits prior to mission execution. 7.  Preposition parachutes during contingency missions with hostilities and hazardous functional/acceptance check flights. When carried, aircraft will have one parachute per crewmember. Each crewmember will wear or fit and have readily accessible for bailout. ML-4 kits are required only for overwater flights when parachutes are carried. 18 AFI11-2C-130V3ADDA  13 AUGUST 2009 Chapter 3 FLOOR PLANS AND REQUIRED EQUIPMENT WEIGHT AND BALANCE DATA 3.1.  General  .    This  chapter  contains  basic  cargo  compartment  configuration  in  floor  plan format and weight, location, and moment data for associated required equipment. 3.2.  Configuration  .  Although modifications to the basic configurations are authorized to meet special requirements, the following factors should be considered. 3.2.1.  Single  sidewall  seats  shall  not  be  used  unless  connected  to  a  double  sidewall  seat (except  for  specific  configurations).  Seats  are  numbered  for  identification  and  will  be referred  to  as  sidewall  seat  1-left/1-right  or  center  aisle  seat  1-left/1-right,  etc.  To  allow unrestricted access to the flight deck and/or crew entrance door, seats 1-left and 2-left, will be stowed when they are not needed to accomplish a specific mission. 3.2.2.  Passengers/ambulatory  patients  may  not  be  seated  closer  than  30  inches  in  front  of palletized,  netted  cargo.  This  does  not  apply  to  palletized,  netted  cargo  supplemented  with chains  or  chain  bridle  assemblies.  When  palletized  or  non-palletized  cargo  is  secured  with aircraft tie down chains, the 30-inch spacing is not required.  EXCEPTION:  When carrying litters, 30-inch spacing will always be maintained regardless of cargo type or restraint used. 3.2.3.  The normal spacing for paratroopers is 24 inches; however, spacing will be as mission dictates. Aircraft without accommodations for 24-inch spacing may be configured in 20-inch spacing. 3.2.4.  The  height  of  cargo  in  pallet  position  one  may  be  restricted  if  overhead  equipment racks are installed which protrude into the cargo area. This restriction will be 76 inches and will  begin  at  the  inboard  side  of  the  dual  rails  and  extend  inboard  for  12  inches.  This restriction could be on either or both sides of the aircraft. 3.2.5.  For flight, the weight limit on the aircraft ramp is limited to 4,664 pounds of palletized cargo  in  pallet  position  six,  including  the  weight  of  pallet  and  nets,  or  4,824  pounds  floor loaded cargo (ramp intermediate conveyors removed and stowed forward of ramp). See T.O. 1C-130A-9, Cargo Loading Manual, for other restrictions. 3.2.6.  Changes  in  configuration  may  affect  the  overall  aircraft  center  of  gravity  (CG).  NOTE:  The addition of aircraft defensive systems, armor, and other modifications produces an  extreme  forward  CG  which  must  be  countered  by  adjusting  the  load  center  of  balance within the range of F.S. 550 to F.S. 575. 3.2.7.  To allow access to aft latrine facilities, a 20-inch clear area is required on the forward left or right side of a pallet in position six (C-130H, 83-0486 and up have the latrine facilities on the right side). A safety aisle is required in pallet positions one (AMP only), three, four, and six.  (Para 4.2.3 and Figure 4.1) 3.2.8.  Parachutes  will  be  carried  as  required  IAW  Table  2.3.  When  passengers/troops  are carried  with  parachutes  onboard,  up  to  four  seats  will  not  be  available  in  the  cargo compartment. AFI11-2C-130V3ADDA  13 AUGUST 2009 19 3.2.9.  Portable  cargo  winches  will  only  be  carried  on  combat/contingency  missions  unless tasked by mission requirements.  Trashcans, other than the integral refuse containers, will not be carried (except on WC-130 airplanes). 3.2.10.  Location  of  dual  rail  locks  and  seat  stanchions  is  provided  in  Table  4.4  for  load planning information. the  final 3.2.11.  For  aeromedical  evacuation  (AE)  configurations, litter  equipment configuration and aeromedical evacuation crewmember (AECM) seating will be determined by the Medical Crew Director (MCD) and Charge Medical  Technician (CMT). AECM seat locations  may  vary  in  the  cargo  compartment  based  on  patient/cabin  observation requirements.  Overhead  equipment  racks,  missile  defense  system  modifications,  AMP mission processors, and secure voice communications system will decrease litter capacity in the litter tiers adjacent to their installation. Six seats are required for AECMs/loadmaster. For all AE configurations, the seats are numbered for identification from the front to the rear and will be referred to as seat 1-left, or seat 1-right, etc. Litter tiers are identified alphabetically and  litter  spaces  identified  numerically  from  the  lowest  (1)  to  the  highest  (5).  On  litter  tier configuration  illustrations,  the  number  in  parentheses  indicates  the  total  litters  per  tier.  For AE configurations, roller conveyers will be removed from the area where litters and seats are rigged.  They  will  be  stowed  on  top  of  restraint  rail  assemblies,  (and/or  under  center  aisle seats for some configurations) and forward of the troop doors, except for those required for the baggage pallet.  EXCEPTION:  If no other option is available but to stow conveyors in the troop door area, stack them no more than two high. Available seating may be limited by AE  equipment,  which  may  be  secured  in  unused  seats  if  floor  space  is  limited.  Portable therapeutic liquid oxygen (PTLOX) must be stowed so as not to come into contact with fuels or hydraulic fluids.  NOTE:  Five oxygen walk around bottles/PBEs will be available for AE personnel on AE configurations. 3.3.  Legend of Configurations: 3.3.1.  Some  aircraft  may  be  nose  heavy  due  to  armor  installation  and  other  modifications. Actual amount of passengers/litter patients/paratroopers/cargo allowed onboard may vary as determined by  aircraft center of  gravity limitations.  EXAMPLE: Sidewall  litter spaces may not be available due to installation of aircraft equipment. 3.3.2.  Consideration should be given to cargo size to allow adequate legroom for passengers when loading rolling stock next to passengers.  For cargo width up to 76 inches, passengers can be seated on both  sides of the cargo;  for cargo  widths 77-96 inches,  passengers can be seated  on  one  side  of  the  cargo  if  the  cargo  is  offset  to  one  side;  and  for  cargo  widths  97 inches or greater, no passengers can be seated next to the cargo. For pallet positions three and four (wheel well): for cargo width up to 52 inches, passengers can be seated on both sides; for cargo widths 53-72 inches, passengers can be seated on one side of the cargo if the cargo is offset; and for cargo widths 73 inches and greater, no passengers can be seated next to the cargo. 3.3.3.  Drawings in this chapter are not drawn precisely to scale with respect to actual aircraft locations.  Clear  space  depicted  forward  of  center  aisle  seat  number  one  and  aft  of  seat number 20 on TAP-1 configuration is unusable. 20 AFI11-2C-130V3ADDA  13 AUGUST 2009 3.3.4.  Seat  totals  listed  in  the  various  configurations  include  those  seats  designated  for aircrew loadmasters. 3.4.  Troop  Life  Preserver  .  When  paratroopers  are  configured  to  jump  near  or  over  large bodies of water; the service being airdropped will furnish required life preservers. Life preservers indicated  in  the  applicable  configurations  will  only  be  provided  for  emergency  ditching operations when paratroopers are not configured with their own. 3.5.  Crew/Passenger/Troop  Drinking  Water.  Each  basic  configuration  provides  for  an adequate  amount  of  drinking  water.  For  example,  a  two-gallon  water  container  will  always  be provided; and for missions requiring more water IAW with Table  5.5, additional containers are available. Table  5.5 is provided to assist in determining  minimum water  quantities. The gallon amounts are based off of 16 oz per person up to six hours and 8 oz every three hours thereafter. The  table  is  not  provided  as  an  absolute  requirement  and  should  not  be  used  to  cause  mission delay or refusal to airlift passengers. At no time will a mission be flown with no water aboard.  NOTE:  When deploying to an austere environment or locations where a potable water source is unavailable, ensure a sufficient amount of water is onboard to complete the mission. 3.6.  Configuration Floor Plans.  Configuration floor plans are depicted on Figure 3.1 through Figure 3.30 AFI11-2C-130V3ADDA  13 AUGUST 2009 21  Figure 3.1.  Configuration AE-1.  Table 3.1.

General.  This chapter contains information to assist personnel in load planning. 4.2.  Emergency  Exits  and  Safety  Aisles.  Load  aircraft  in  such  a  manner  that  ensures  the following emergency exits and safety aisles are available: 4.2.1.  Equipment  will  not  be  positioned  in  a  manner  that  obstructs  the  side  emergency escape hatches.  An obstruction is any equipment that prevents the effective means of rapid evacuation.  Litters  and  seats  erected  across  an  emergency  exit  are  not  considered  to  be  an obstruction. 4.2.2.  One  unobstructed  emergency  exit  will  be  available  for  each  20  passengers/troops.  (This does not restrict overwater flights if the three overhead escape hatches are available for egress.) 4.2.3.  When  passengers  are  being  airlifted,  an  unobstructed  aisleway  will  be  maintained  in the  pallet  positions  one  (C-130  AMP  only)  three,  four  (wheel  well)  and  six  (ramp  area)  to provide access to emergency exits. In pallet positions one, three and four,  the aisleway will be a minimum of 14 inches wide between the outer edge of the cargo and the aircraft and will begin  at  the  cargo  floor  or  dual  rail  outboard  frame.  The  dual  rail  outboard  frame  provides eight  inches  of  the  14-inch  requirement  on  the  main  cargo  floor  (Figure  4.1.).  Tiedown equipment  (463L  nets,  straps,  chains,  and  devices)  shall  not  normally  be  considered  an obstruction. In pallet position six (ramp area) the aisleway will be a minimum of eight inches beginning  at  the  outboard  edge  of  the  dual  rail  outboard  frame.    The  aisleway  should normally be on the left side of the aircraft.  If the aisleway is placed on the right side of the aircraft, clearance to the right side of the aircraft must be maintained.  Additionally, access to aft  latrine  facilities  requires  a  20-inch  clear  area  on  the  forward  left  or  right  side  of  cargo loaded on the ramp.  On C-130 E(H), and H (prior to 83-0486) the clear area must be on the left side of the pallet.  On C-130H (83-0486 and up) the clear area must be on the right side of the pallet. 4.2.4.  If  the  aisleway  requirement  in  paragraph  4.2.3.  cannot  be  achieved  on  missions carrying crew only or mission-essential personnel (MEP) authorized by operations order/plan or DIRMOBFOR, then an aisleway will be maintained in  pallet positions one (C-130 AMP only), three and four (wheel well) that provides a minimum of 14 inches between the outer edge  of the floor/pallet/platform  or  a  minimum  of  30  inches  between  the  outer  edge  of  cargo  and  the aircraft  beginning  no  higher  than  60  inches  above  the  floor/pallet/platform  (Figure  4.2).  MAJCOM  A3/DO  is  authorized  to  waive  this  requirement  based  on  MAJCOM  Stan/Eval evaluation and recommendation. the  cargo  and  aircraft  beginning  no  higher than  36 inches  above 4.2.5.  During  airdrop  missions,  loadmasters  shall  have  access  to  the  rear  of  the  aircraft  to accomplish tactical checklists. 4.2.6.  On all missions, cargo will be loaded in such a way that the crew will have access to the rear of the aircraft.  Cargo in Chapter 6 of T.O. 1C-130A-9 are specific and do not require a waiver. 58 AFI11-2C-130V3ADDA  13 AUGUST 2009 4.3.  Miscellaneous Data  .

Table weights are expressed in thousands. When using this chart, round off takeoff and landing fuel to the lowest thousand pounds, subtract the remaining fuel from the charted base weight to arrive at the corrected base weight. The following example is provided: Takeoff fuel is 25,800 pounds, round off fuel to 25,000, at 25,000 pounds of fuel chart base weight is 130,000, subtract remaining fuel, 800 pounds, corrected base fuel weight is 129,200 pounds. Use this procedure for both takeoff and landing fuel. Enter the most restrictive weight in the fuel block in the limitations column.  2. Both takeoff and landing conditions must be calculated. The most restrictive will be used on the  Form F.  NOTE: This chart may be used under normal operations. If for any reason the aircraft gross weight is restricted, operating at overload gross weights, or the fuel balance is not IAW the primary/secondary fuel charts, then the appropriate charts in T.O. 1C-130X-1, Section V, must be used to determine ACL.
