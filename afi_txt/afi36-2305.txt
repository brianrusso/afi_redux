The  system  of  regional  and  national  accreditation  recognizes  educational institutions  and  professional  programs  affiliated  with  those  institutions        for  level  of performance,  integrity,  and  quality  which  entitles  them  to  the  confidence  of  the  educational community and the public they serve. The Air Force recognizes schools with regional or national accreditation  and  candidacy  for  education  level  updates.  Other  schools  require  additional recognition as outlined in this AFI. at the 3.1.1.  The  Department  of  Education  provides  a  directory  of  accredited  programs  and institutions website https://www2.ed.gov/admins/finaid/accred/index.htmlhttp://www.ed.gov/admins/finaid/accred/index.html. The Council on Higher Education Accreditation published website with accreditation information is http://www.chea.org/. The office accomplishing education level update  uses  one  of  these  publications  to  verify  accredited  institutions  and  candidates  for accreditation. Contact the appropriate accrediting body to verify additions to the guide since its  last  publication.  Address  any  further  questions  concerning  the  accreditation  status  of institutions to AFIT/ACB.  (T- 1) following 3.1.2.  Universities, colleges, or training schools not meeting any of the criteria mentioned in paragraph  3.1. must submit  a request  to  the appropriate accrediting agency/association for inclusion in the Department of Education guides. It is the school’s responsibility to provide AFIT/ACB  with  necessary  documentation  to  prove  accreditation,  candidacy,  or  federal degree  granting  authority.    This  information  will  be  forwarded  to  AFPOA/DPRMT  for addition into MilPDS. 3.1.3.  Non-accredited Institutions. Accept documentation for education level update only if the  Airman  pays  for  and  obtains  it  from  an  accredited  institution  stating  it  will  accept education credits from that school on the same basis as it would from accredited schools.  (T- 1) 3.1.4.  International Institutions. Accept documentation for education level update of courses completed  when  the  Airman  obtains  an  external  (commercial)  evaluation  of  course  work taken at foreign institutions. Foreign institutions that issue acceptable transcripts are listed in the Accredited Institutions of Postsecondary Education, published by the American Council on Education (ACE). Enter educational achievement obtained at international institutions in official  records  if  properly  evaluated.  An  accredited  school  (other  than  AFIT)  or  a  private evaluation  agency,  such  as  the  National  Association  of  Credential  Education  Services (NACES), must accomplish the evaluation.  (T- 1) 3.2.  Letter of Intention to Graduate.  For individuals that have completed all the requirements for a degree, but the college has not  yet awarded/conferred degrees, a 90 day temporary update may  be  requested.  Members  must  request  the  institution  send  an  official  letter  on  institution letterhead  stationary  signed  by  the  university  registrar's  office  which  includes:  the  student’s name, degree (or major area of study), degree or program level (i.e., certificate), number of hours completed  or  date  of  completion  of  degree  requirements,  and  the  date  the  degree  will  be awarded/conferred.  Indiviuals  must  ensure  an  official  degree  posted  transcript  is  provided  to 8 AFI36-2305  OCTOBER 5, 2017 AFIT/ACB (Officers) or ETS (Enlisted) once available but no later than 90 days after conferral or  the  update  will  be  removed  from  the  member’s  record.  If  the  degree  has  already  been awarded, official transcripts must be sent for record updates. NOTE: Letters will not be accepted if they contain pending actions by the university to include financial, academic or other audits.  (T- 1) 3.2.1.  High School.  Accept high school diploma from accredited institution or high school equivalency  certificate.  Certification  of  the  General  Educational  Development  Test, academic education level B, may be entered when the individual achieves a standard score of 35  on  each  test  and  an  average  standard  score  of  45  on  all  five  parts.  For  prior  service members  enlisting  in  the  AF  Reserve,  DD  Form  214,  Certificate  of  Release  or  Discharge From  Active  Duty,  is  an  acceptable  source  document  for  verifying  high  school  completion.  NOTE:  Degree  levels  below  the  bachelor  level  are  not  updated  for  AF  officers  unless specifically  required,  i.e.,  ANG  Nurse  Corps  personnel.  Technical/Occupational  certificates are not updated for AF officers.  (T- 1) 3.2.2.  Associate  Degree.    Accept  official  transcript  from  an  accredited  institution.  For  a CCAF degree  an  automated process  updates the  member’s  education level  based on CCAF credit hours recorded and graduation status. A CCAF degree progress report from the on-line system may be used to verify education levels E through H (Attachment 4). NOTE:  Degree levels below the bachelor level are not updated for AF officers unless specifically required, i.e., Air National Guard (ANG) Nurse Corps personnel.  Technical/occupational certificates are not updated for AF officers.  (T- 1) 3.2.3.  Less than Bachelor’s Degree.  Accept education credit from accredited institutions as shown on an official  transcript or other official  documentation directly from the institution. NOTE:  Degree  levels  below  the  bachelor  level  are  not  updated  for  AF  officers  unless specifically  required,  i.e.,  ANG  Nurse  Corps  personnel.  Technical/Occupational  certificates are not updated for AF officers.  CCAF degrees are not maintained for AF officers.  (T- 1) 3.2.4.  Bachelor’s Degree and above.  Accept official transcript from an accredited institution or when the institution has federal degree-granting authority and is identified as offering the appropriate degree level (masters, doctorate, etc.).  (T- 1) 3.2.5.  Certificate.    Professional  certificates  are  a  designation  earned  by  members  to  certify that  they  are  qualified  to  perform  a  job.    For  example,  a  person  with  a  degree  in  general education  could  qualify  for  an  education  specialty  code  in  secondary  teaching  based  on possession  of  a  teaching  certificate  (Code  7  only).    MilPDS  also  will  accept  certain certificates for inclusion in an enlisted Airman’s military record.  (T- 1) AFI36-2305  OCTOBER 5, 2017 9 Chapter 4 EDUCATION LEVEL UPDATE PROCESS 4.1.  Officer  Updates.  Officers  are  responsible  for  ensuring  the  accuracy  of  their  education records  annually.  It  is  the officer’s responsibility to  contact  the issuing institution  and fund the cost of any requested transcript/documentation (see paragraph 3.2.) for update and/or correction of  military  records.  Transcript  fees  are  not  reimbursable  by  the  Air  Force.    Transcripts/ documentation  must  be  mailed  or  sent  electronically  from  the  issuing  institution  directly  to AFIT/ACB.  NOTE:  Transcripts  issued  to  students  will  be  accepted  if  they  are  in  an  originally sealed  unopened  envelope  from  the  issuing  institution  or  the  ETS  can  verify  the  transcript  as official, not maintained by student, and signs/dates copy of transcript with statement verifying its official nature in the ETS office.  (T- 1) 4.1.1.  Initial  Accession.    AFIT/ACB  will  accomplish  education  level  update  into  MilPDS and  input  source  documents  into  AFAEMS  for  audit  purposes  after  receipt  of  official transcript as outlined in Table A2.1 and details in paragraph 2.5. (T- 1) 4.1.2.  After Initial Entry and Initial Education Level Update.  See paragraph 3.2. AFIT/ACB will  accomplish  education  level  update  into  MilPDS  and  input  source  documents  into AFAEMS after receipt of appropriate documentation.  (T- 1) 4.1.3.  For AFIT-sponsored programs (Civilian Institution), AFIT/ACB updates the Airman’s record  upon  receipt  of  official  transcripts  and  AFIT/CIG  (Civilian  Institution)  source document reflecting the academic specialty code (ASC) for which the Airman was sponsored to  receive.  Airmen  requesting  an  ASC  change  must  first  obtain  approval  from  AFIT/CIG, who  will  forward  appropriate  source  document  change  to  AFIT/ACB.    For  AFIT  graduate programs,  AFIT/ACB  updates  the  Airman’s  record  upon  receipt  of  official  transcript  and AFIT/CIM  source  document  reflecting  the  ASC  for  which  the  Airman  was  sponsored  to receive.    Airmen  requesting  an  ASC  change  must  first  obtain  approval  from  AFIT/CIM through HQ USAF.  (T- 1) 4.1.4.  For medical service officers attending AFIT-sponsored graduate programs, at civilian institutions,  AFIT/ACB  updates  the  Airman’s  record  upon  receipt  of  official/source documentation  from  AFIT/CIM.    AFPC/DP2ND  (for  AFSC  47XX),  DP2NN  (for  AFSC 46XX), DP2NP (for AFSCs 44XX, 45XX, and 48XX), DP2ND (for AFSC 41AX), DP2NW (for AFSCs 42XX and 43XX) must approve exceptions to this procedure.  (T- 1) 4.2.  Enlisted  Updates  .    Enlisted  Airmen  are  responsible  for  ensuring  the  accuracy  of  their education records annually. It is the Airman’s responsibility to contact the issuing institution and fund the cost of any requested transcript/documentation for update and/or correction of military records. Transcript fees are not reimbursable by the Air Force. Transcripts/documentation must be  mailed  or  sent  electronically  from  the  issuing  institution  directly  to  the  base  ETS.  ETS  will accomplish  education  level  update  into  AFAEMS/MilPDS  and  input  source  documents  into AFAEMS  for  audit  purposes.  (The  source  document  must  include  the  conferral  date).  NOTE: Transcripts  issued  to  students  will  be  accepted  if  they  are  in  an  originally  sealed  unopened envelope  from  the  issuing  institution  or  the  ETS  can  verify  the  transcript  as  official,  not maintained  by  student,  and  signs/dates  copy  of  transcript  with  statement  verifying  its  official nature in the ETS office.  (T- 1) 10 AFI36-2305  OCTOBER 5, 2017 4.2.1.  Initial Enlistment.  DD Form 1966-2, with transcript attached, substantiates education data  for  those  accessed  into  the  Air  Force.  The  737  TRSS  staff  files  the  forms  in  the Automated  Records  Management  System.  NOTE:  For  ARC  members,  official  transcripts must  be  sent  to  the  servicing  Reserve  military  personnel  flight/education  and  training function.  (T- 1) 4.2.2.  After Initial Enlistment.  The base ETS evaluates education achievements for enlisted personnel and updates records as described in paragraph 4.2.  The base ETS inputs data in MilPDS/AFAEMS.  (T- 1) 4.2.3.  Senior  Noncommissioned  Officers  (SNCO)  (Master  Sergeants  and  Senior  Master Sergeants)  Eligible  for  Promotion.    If  a  SNCO  is  meeting  a  promotion  or  other  selection board, or is eligible for assignment, and official transcripts are not immediately available, the base  ETS  will  accept  an  official  letter,  on  school  letterhead  stationery,  signed  by  the institution’s  registrar  verifying  education  accomplishment.    The  letter  must  include  the following  information:  student’s  name,  name  of  the  board,  name  of  degree/program,  major area of study, number of hours completed or date of completion of degree requirements, and the date of graduation/degree award if different from degree completion requirements.  The base  ETS  may  use  the  earlier  date  of  degree  completion  for  education  level  update.    The respective  boards  establish  final  cutoff  dates  for  records  update;  consequently,  inclusion  of last  minute  updates  in  the  consideration  process  cannot  be  assured.    Upon  receipt  of information  on  official  letterhead,  the  ETS  can  notify  the  board  indicated,  if  requested  by Airman.  These updates are valid for a 90-day temporary update. (T- 1) AFI36-2305  OCTOBER 5, 2017 11 Chapter 5 EDUCATION CLASSIFICATION AND CODES Education data entries in MilPDS/AFAEMS consist of three sets.  One set is for coding academic education  specialty  (classification),  another  for  coding  the  education  level,  and  a  third  for  the method/resource  used  to  obtain  the  education  level.    Entries  of  letters  X,  Y,  and  Z  in  the education coding process indicate ―other, ―not applicable, and ―unknown, respectively.  The letters X and Y are most often entered in the last two positions of the specialty code to identify no specialization or specialization in an area for which no precise identifier exists.  The letter Z in the education level high position will prompt periodic output of an action-due notice at base level, instructing individuals to provide proof of education accomplishment. 5.1.  Coding  of  Academic  Specialty.  Terms  used to  define  an  education  specialty (classification) conform generally to civilian usage.  The education specialties consist of a four-character  alphanumeric  code to  identify (in order) general  area of study,  major education field, specialization,  and  sub-specialization.  Together  they  form  an  individual’s  education  specialty code.  Review of the school’s catalog, discussions with the school, and student consultation may be necessary to determine education specialty (Attachment 3). 5.1.1.  General  Area  of  Study.    There  are  10  groupings  of  education  areas  of  study (Attachment  3).    A  person  coded  4YYY,  for  example,  would  be  identified  as  having,  or working toward, a general engineering degree with no major education field, specialization, or sub-specialization. 5.1.2.  Major.    This  character  identifies  a  related  specialization  within  the  general  area  of study and consists of 18 or more semester hours.  This term usually identifies the education degree title awarded by a college or university and is considered a person’s major.  Building on the preceding example, a person coded 4AYY would be identified as having, or working toward, a degree in aeronautical engineering with no specialization or sub-specialization. 5.1.3.  Specialization.  Persons who have a concentration, reflected on the official transcript, in a particular education area may qualify for identification of specialization. Again building on  the  preceding  example,  4AAY  would  identify  a  person  with  a  degree  in  aeronautical engineering  with  specialization  in  aerodynamics.    Specificity  to  this  level  is  reserved  for those  who  have  completed  advanced  undergraduate  or  graduate  work  (a  CCAF  associate degree is an exception). 5.1.4.  Sub-specialization.    This  character  identifies  a  group  of  courses  or  on-the-job professional experience associated with a given specialization.  Graduate study with specific research is an example of readily identifiable sub-specialization.  Sub-specialization may also be  identified  on  the  basis  of  professional  competency  gained  by  experience  on  the  job  or documented  self-initiated  study.    In  the  preceding  4AAY  example,  sub-specialization  in aerodynamic loads would be identified by the code 4AAA. 5.2.  Coding of Education Level. 5.2.1.  Each  education  level  has  a  one  alpha  or  numeric  character  code  in  MilPDS.  (See attachment 4) 12 AFI36-2305  OCTOBER 5, 2017 5.2.2.  Education  Levels  within MilPDS.  The standard measures for determining education levels are semester hours and degrees.  Quarter hours are converted to semester hours.  One quarter hour equals two-thirds of one semester hour. MilPDS (Headquarters Air Force (HAF) Table  0228)  and  Attachment  2  of  this  instruction  show  the  various  education  levels  and corresponding codes. 5.2.2.1.  A maximum of five education levels may be assigned and coded for each officer and enlisted person. 5.2.2.2.  A  person  with  two  degrees  at  the  same  education  level  is  coded  first  with  the degree earned most recently. 5.2.2.3.  Individuals  receiving  dual  majors  will  only  be  updated  as  having  one  degree level as they are considered one degree.  In order to receive credit for both, the university will need to assign individual graduation dates for each major.  (T- 1) 5.3.  Coding of Method/Resource Used to Obtain Education. 5.3.1.  This code is a one alpha or numeric character code to show major source of funding used to obtain a particular education level. 5.3.2.  Even though MilPDS data field is labeled “―method” this code must reflect funding source  before  consideration  of  the  program.    The  most  common  codes  are  “T—  tuition assistance” and “None-N/A.”  Examples of funding as primary method is the choice of “T” for Tuition Assistance (TA) Program  or “J” for CCAF if TA is  not  used for CCAF degree.  (See  PDS,  HAF  Table  0102  and  Attachment  5  of  this  instruction).    NOTE:    For  officer records, the method “T” will not be used.  DANIEL L.
