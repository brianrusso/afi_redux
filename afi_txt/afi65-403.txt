Followup files must contain all confirmation documents.  Authorizedofficials may not close audit recommendations until management completes all corrective actions anddocuments realized monetary benefits. Decided—The status when an agreement reached between management and auditors on previouslyundecided (nonconcurred with) findings, recommendations, or monetary benefits or a decision made by asenior Air Force official to resolve a disagreement.  This definition applies to Air Force-level andinstallation-level audit reports.Decision Process—The process that management and auditors use to reach agreement on undecidedfindings, recommendations, or monetary benefits.  Representatives must decide all nonconcurrenceswithin 6 months of the date of the audit report.Disallowed Cost—A questioned cost that management decides or agrees not to charge to thegovernment.  (This term is applicable only to incurred cost audits such as those about defective pricing ondefense contracts.)Final Action—The completion of all agreed-on management actions that implement recommendations inan audit report.  If management concludes no action is necessary, final action occurs following amanagement decision.  Management must document actual realized monetary benefits for any completedaction.Finding—As defined in the US Comptroller General’s Government Auditing Standards, a statementmade on the basis of analyzed or evaluated information about an organization, program, activity, function,12condition, or other auditing matter.  Inspection organizations may refer to findings as "observations."Followup Focal Point—An Air Force management-level representative designated to assist the followupofficial in implementing the followup program.  Normally, this representative also serves as the focalpoint for processing audit announcements, draft reports, management comments, and so on.Followup Program—A  program  ensuring  that  management  implements  agreed-on  auditrecommendations, corrects agreed-on deficiencies and, if applicable, documents realized monetarybenefits.  The followup program officially begins when the audit is published and ends when managementgives explicit written confirmation that the corrective action or on-site verification is complete.Followup Records—Audit report records that document the status and completion of managementactions and the PMB that management either realizes or estimates will accrue from implementing therecommendation.Funds Put to Better Use—The financial impact of an audit recommendation.  Funds that organizationscould use more efficiently if management takes action to implement and complete  n auditrecommendation.  The vast majority of potential monetary benefits resulting from internal audit fall intothis category.  Examples:• Reducing outlays.• Deobligating funds from programs or operations.• Withdrawing interest subsidy costs on loans or loan guarantees, insurance, or bonds.•Implementing  recommended  cost-saving  improvements  related  to  operations  of  the  establish-ment, a contractor, or grantee.• Avoiding unnecessary expenditures noted in preaward reviews of contract or grant agreements.• Gaining any other specifically identified savings. Calculate these savings on the basis of statisticalprojections, when appropriate.Management Response—Management comments (concurrence or nonconcurrence) and planned actionson the findings, recommendations, and monetary benefits included in an audit report. Monetary Benefits—Questioned costs or funds put to better use.Open Recommendation—Agreed-on  audit-report  recommendations  that  management  hasn’timplemented or documented for realized monetary benefits.Questioned Cost—An incurred cost the auditors question because of any of these findings:• An alleged violation of a provision of a law, regulation, contract, grant, cooperative agreement, orother agreement or document governing the expenditure of funds.Inadequate documentation at the time of the audit. •• Unnecessary  or  unreasonable  expenditure  of  funds  for  the  intended  purpose.    (Applies  only  toincurred cost audits such as those about defective pricing on defense contracts.) RCS: DD-IG(SA)1574, Followup Status Report—A report submitted semiannually to the OIG, DoDcontaining statistical information  or AFAA Air Force-level audit reports.Realized Monetary Benefits—The measurable and documented amount of monetary benefits actuallyachieved after the cognizant manager has completed corrective actions.  Documentation normallyincludes references to official budget and accounting data.  If such documentation isn’t feasible, managers13may use an updated estimate and its rationale as support for the realized amount.  Management considersmonetary benefits that are associated with specific recommendations as closed (actually realized) after thecognizant manager completes the related corrective actions and furnishes explicit written confirmation ofthe amount actually realized. Subordinate Command Level—All levels below the commander of a MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU thatreceive audit reports. Tracking Summary—An  AFAA-prepared  document  that  SAF/FMPF  uses  for  tracking  anddocumenting management’s completed recommendations and realized monetary benefits on AirForce-level audit reports.  The tracking summary also documents management’s reasons for not meetingestimated completion dates and, when necessary, establishes a revised completion date.Undecided—The status of final audit findings, recommendations, or estimated PMB when managementhasn’t commented on or concurred with the audit report or when audit officials don’t agree with themanagement position.  Designated managers, auditors, and senior officials must decide all issues within 6months of the date of the audit report.14Attachment 2 SAMPLE RCS: DD-IG(SA)1574, FOLLOWUP STATUS REPORTPART IAIR FORCE FOLLOWUP OFFICIAL’S NARRATIVE SUMMARYA2.1.
