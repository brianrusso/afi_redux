General.  This instruction provides information for computed air release systems for airdrop ofequipment and personnel.1.2.  Applicability. This instruction applies to all US Air Force aircrew members directly involved incomputing air release points for airdrop operations of parachutists, equipment, supply bundles, and train-ing bundles. HQ AMC is the lead command for this instruction. Individual major commands (MAJCOM)may supplement and waive elements of this instruction for operational necessity. Send information per-taining to any supplement or waiver to this instruction to the lead command as soon as practical. Individ-ual MAJCOMs will be responsible for providing HQ AMC ballistic data specific to their command ormission. Additionally, all lead MAJCOMs must identify which items in this AFI apply to their aircrewsfor use in their specific mission. Note: Some aircraft are capable of computing wind adjusted releasepoints solutions through onboard mission computers without the use of procedures contained in theinstruction.1.3.  Administration. Organization commanders will ensure distribution of one copy per aircrew mem-ber who is directly involved in calculating air release points and one copy per operations section of air-drop tasked units. Holders are responsible for posting revisions and changes.1.4.  Recommended Changes. Use AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication,according to AFI 11-215, Flight Manuals Program (FMP), to recommend a change to this instruction.All AF Forms 847 must be approved by HQ AMC/DOV, through respective MAJCOM channels.1.5.  Deviations. Deviations to this instruction are authorized for safety or protection of aircrew or air-craft. As soon as possible, inform respective MAJCOM of reason for deviation and course of action taken.For other types of deviation, submit waiver requests through normal channels to respective MAJCOM.File approved waivers in the back of this instruction until expired or rescinded.1.6.  Individual Circular Error Record (does not apply to AFSOC or C-17 units).   Each  unit  willmaintain Circular Error (CE) records for aircrew members (primarily navigators) who are responsible forCARP computations and who initiate the airdrop sequence. Use AF Form 4012, Individual Air DropCircular Error Record. Compute a separate CEA for each category listed below. Use the last ten (10)airdrops for each category or those recorded within the last six months (whichever is less). Record a dropscore over 600 yards as a 600 yards Circular Error Average (CEA). Aircrew members, defined in thisparagraph, must receive supervised training if their CEA exceeds 225 yards. Confirmed equipment mal-functions, troop exit delays, releases not controlled by the aircrew (such as jumpmaster directed airdrops),and racetracks will not be included in the computations. Use the following categories:1.6.1.  Actual personnel - visual day and night separately.1.6.2.  Actual heavy equipment - visual day and night separately.1.6.3.  Actual Container Delivery System (CDS) - visual day and night separately.AFI11-231   31 AUGUST 200591.6.4.  Standard Airdrop Training Bundle (SATB) - visual day and night reported together.1.6.5.  Zone Marker or SKE timing - all.1.6.6.  AWADS or AUTOCARP - all.NOTES:Included SATBs released on actual CARPs for sight angle training in the appropriate actual load com-putations.Units may track CEAs for pilots flying the aircraft as well as by tail numbers (to determine or verifytrends in alignment or equipment performance).1.7.  Successful Airdrop Criteria:1.7.1.  Unilateral training. Successful criteria is governed by applicable MAJCOM instructions or sup-plements.1.7.2.  Other than unilateral training. Score airdrop events as successful if 90 percent of the loads landwithin the boundaries of the surveyed DZ and are recovered in usable condition by friendly forces.10AFI11-231   31 AUGUST 2005Chapter 2  COMPUTED AIR RELEASE POINT (CARP) SYSTEM2.1.  General.  The CARP solution is based on average parachute ballistics and fundamental dead reckon-ing principles. These principles, laid out in this instruction, minimize errors while providing ease of pre-flight and inflight mission planning.2.2.  Responsibility. The aircrew member who initiates the airdrop sequence computes the release pointsolution for all airdrops. The actual computation of the computed release point may be accomplished fora formation by a designated qualified aircrew member. However, each individual aircrew is responsiblefor its accuracy. The pilot flying the aircraft assumes responsibility for maintaining drift offset andrequired track during run-in. The navigator (or pilot not flying the aircraft when a navigator is not part ofthe crew) controls the time to airdrop sequence initiation, “Green Light.” This crewmember also controlsthe end of usable drop zone time “Red Light” and updates the required drift offset for the pilot to fly. Air-crew members must have a thorough understanding of this system. Complete cooperation and teamworkbetween these crew positions is essential for best results. Exception: HC-130 unique airdrops maybe ini-tiated IAW mission specific procedures.Exception: C-17 Procedures. The C-17 utilizes an onboard mission computer (MC) system to compute a CARP solution. Both pilots are responsible for ensuring all computer entries are correct. The MC controls the time to airdrop sequence initiation, “Green Light.” It also controls the end of usable drop zone time, “Red Light,” and updates the required drift offset for the pilot to fly.2.3.  Methods of Airdrop. 2.3.1.  Personnel and Door Bundle. This type of airdrop load either exits, is pushed, or is skidded fromthe paratroop door or aircraft ramp and door.2.3.2.  Gravity. The aircraft maintains a “nose-high” attitude (if required) and inflight release of loadrestraint allows the load to roll out of the aircraft. A rigging system may be used to initiate and accel-erate load movement.2.3.3.  Extraction. An extraction parachute pulls the load from the cargo compartment.2.4.  Types of Airdrop. 2.4.1.  Free-Fall. Delivery of non-fragile items without the use of parachutes. Loads require specialpreparation to prevent damage from impact.2.4.2.  High Velocity (Hi-V). Delivery of certain supply items rigged in containers with an energy dis-sipater attached to the underside and supported by a ring-slot parachute. The ring-slot parachute stabi-lizes the load and retards the rate of fall to the point of acceptable landing shock. This system mayinclude equipment loads dropped using reefed parachutes.2.4.3.  Low Velocity. Delivery of personnel and various items of supply and equipment by use ofcargo parachutes. Loads are prepared for airdrop by packing items in airdrop containers or by riggingthem on platforms.AFI11-231   31 AUGUST 20052.5.  Governing Factors:112.5.1.  The CARP is based on the first load to exit the aircraft (Exception: When door bundles precedepersonnel, compute separate CARPs for the personnel and for the bundle. Release the bundle on thepersonnel CARP after ensuring that the bundle will impact on the surveyed DZ).2.5.2.  The actual ground pattern of sequentially airdropped loads depends on the following:2.5.2.1.  Time lapse between “Green Light” and time of exit of last item.2.5.2.2.  Aircraft stability from release to “Red Light.”2.5.2.3.  Uniformity of loads and/or parachutes within an element.2.5.2.4.  Glide angle of individual parachutes.2.5.2.5.  Ability of jumper to see desired landing point and steer to it.2.5.2.6.  Aircraft track from “Green Light” to “Red Light”2.5.2.7.  Aircraft altitude and speed.2.5.2.8.  Weather (primarily winds).2.5.3.  Accurate airdrop requires timely drop zone or drop zone target acquisition to assure properalignment. The alignment or cross track drift offset, based on the most current winds, must be main-tained during the final approach to the release point and throughout the drop period.2.6.  Parachute Characteristics:2.6.1.  Parachute Ballistics. Each parachute has its own peculiarities. The ballistics given in thisinstruction are acceptable averages. This testing is conducted by the US Army Airborne Board, USArmy Quartermaster Corps, and US Army Natick Laboratories. USAF Aeronautical Systems Centerat Wright-Patterson Air Force Base validates the tested ballistics for aircrew use.2.6.2.  Gliding Angle. Some parachutes (e.g., T-10) glide randomly in direction. Others (e.g., MT-1)are designed to glide in one direction. Unless the direction and speed of the glide are known, this fac-tor cannot be accounted for in the CARP.2.7.  Drop Winds. Use a composite of altitude and surface winds (if known) to determine drift effect. Themost accurate drop wind is one obtained at drop altitude and airspeed shortly before the drop. When inter-polating a mean effective wind (vectorial average from all sources), take care to consider direction as wellas velocity, and consider weather or other phenomena that may cause wind shear between drop altitudeand the surface. Remember, the higher the drop altitude, the greater the drift effect per knot of wind. Note:When averaging winds to arrive at a ballistic wind, use a vectorial wind average. Using a mathematicalaverage will introduce errors into the CARP solution. Wind sources include, but are not limited to the fol-lowing:2.7.1.  Forecast winds.NOTE: Weather facilities report winds in true bearing.2.7.2.  Inflight visual indications of wind (smoke, dust, etc.).2.7.3.  Electronic and navigation systems (Doppler, SCNS, INS, GPS, LIDAR, etc.).12AFI11-231   31 AUGUST 20052.7.4.  Ground party (CCT, STT, and DZC) furnished magnetic winds. Normally, the ground partyreports winds as a Mean Effective Wind (MEW). The MEW is a theoretical wind, referenced in con-stant speed and direction, extending from the DZ surface to drop altitude. When verified with inflightdata, aircrews should consider the MEW a very desirable source.2.8.  Drop Zones. AFI 13-217, Assault Zone Procedures, Chapter 2 contains DZ information.AFI11-231   31 AUGUST 2005Figure 2.1.  CARP Diagram.1314AFI11-231   31 AUGUST 2005Chapter 3  COMPUTED AIR RELEASE POINT SOLUTIONS3.1.  General.  The primary solution for computing the air release point is the basic computer solutionwhere all requirements are solved using the MB-4 or MAJCOM approved computer software. Note: ForC-17 operations, all computations are stored in the computer and no paper documentation is required.Chute ballistic data is contained in a database within the MC.3.2.  Basic Computed Air Release Point (CARP) Solutions (Does not apply to C-17).  The AF Form4018, Computed Air Release Point Computation, or MAJCOM approved software generate products,will be used to solve and record data. Figure 3.1. provides sample CARP solutions for CDS, HeavyEquipment and Personnel. The basic steps for the AF Form 4018 are as follows:3.2.1.  Item 1. Drop altitude: Selected AGL drop altitude (absolute altitude) in feet. 3.2.2.  Item 2. Terrain Elevation: Elevation, in feet, of the highest point on the surveyed DZ.3.2.3.  Item 3. True Altitude: Computed mean sea level (MSL) drop altitude, in feet (item 1 plus item2). True altitude is the altitude to be flown when the altimeter setting is derived by in-flight altimetercalibration.3.2.4.  Item 4. Pressure Altitude Variation (PAV): The pressure difference, in feet, between mean sealevel and the standard datum plane. PAV is computed by taking the difference between the forecast DZaltimeter setting and the standard day pressure (29.92 in Hg) and multiplying by 10. PAV is positive ifthe forecast altimeter setting is less than 29.92 and negative if the forecast altimeter setting is greaterthan 29.92 (formula A).3.2.5.  Item 5. Pressure Altitude: Drop altitude, in feet above the standard datum plane (item 3 plusitem 4). Used to compute true airspeed and corrected drop altitude.3.2.6.  Item 6. Corrected Drop Altitude: Drop altitude corrected for air density by using formula B andthe ALTITUDE CALCULATIONS window on the MB-4 computer. True Alt Temp     =           Drop Altitude       Pressure Altitude        (Corrected Drop Altitude)3.2.7.  Item 7. Terrain Elevation: Same as item 2.3.2.8.  Item 8. Indicated Altitude: The altitude to be flown with the DZ altimeter setting set in thebarometric scale of the aircraft altimeter.3.2.9.  Item 9. True Altitude Temperature: Temperature in degrees Celsius. Used to compute item 6and item 11.3.2.10.  Item 10. IAS/CAS/EAS: Indicated airspeed (IAS) for the drop as specified by the appropriatedirectives. Calibrated airspeed (CAS) equals IAS corrected for pitot static error, aircraft attitude, andinstrument error. Equivalent airspeed (EAS) equals CAS corrected for compressibility. Log CAS/EASonly when different from IAS.3.2.11.  Item 11. True Airspeed: True airspeed (TAS) is computed on the MB-4 using the DENSITYALTITUDE COMPUTATIONS window and the formula:AFI11-231   31 AUGUST 200515   Temperature   =     (TAS)         Pressure Altitude       EAS3.2.12.  Item 12. Rate of Fall (RF): Extracted from the parachute ballistic data. This velocity isexpressed in feet per second.3.2.13.  Item 13. Adjusted Rate of Fall: RF corrected for air density. Compute on the MB-4 computerusing the DENSITY ALTITUDE COMPUTATIONS window and formula C.  Average Temperature   =     (Adjusted Rate of Fall)           Average Pressure Alt.                Rate of FallNOTE: Average Pressure Altitude is calculated by taking item 5 minus one-half of item 1.3.2.14.  Item 14. Altitude Above Point of Impact: The difference in feet between the PI and the highestpoint on the DZ (terrain elevation) measured in feet AGL (formula D).3.2.15.  Item 15. Vertical Distance: Extracted from the parachute ballistic data.3.2.16.  Item 16. Stabilization Altitude: Item 14 minus item 15.3.2.17.  Item 17. Time of Fall: The elapsed time, in seconds, it takes for the load to fall from stabiliza-tion altitude to the PI. Compute using formula E. Adjusted Rate of Fall        =               1.0           Stabilization Altitude              (Time of Fall)3.2.18.  Item 18. Time of Fall Constant: Extracted from the parachute ballistic data.3.2.19.  Item 19. Total time of Fall: Item 17 plus item 18.3.2.20.  Item 20. Ballistic Wind: The expected wind, interpolated from all available sources, whichwill affect the load on its way the ground.NOTE: CCT/STT furnished surface and mean effective winds are reported as magnetic, while onboardcomputers may provide winds in magnetic, true or grid reference.3.2.21.  Item 21. Drift Effect: Distance in yards computed using formula F.

With the development of new equipment and procedures, additional methods of CARPsolutions have been designed. Four modified CARP solutions and aids are the wind circle, Doppler Gridand Circle Overlay, and AF Form 4014. Alternate methods of updating CARP inflight, including tech-niques for wind analysis and T-CARP constant-angle timing, are included in this chapter. These solutionsincorporate special techniques and tabulated data as aids to expedite the solution of the final CARP whenclose-in to the DZ.4.1.1.  All personnel involved in airdrop must realize aerial delivery using a CARP system is not anexact science. The system permits revisions close to the DZ and takes into considerations winds atvarious levels through which the parachute and load pass. When the aircrew member has a graphicpresentation of the wind vectors and understands the characteristics of the parachutes used, they arebetter able to estimate the best release point. 4.1.2.  Aircrew should be alert for changes in surface and altitude winds in the vicinity of the DZ.Often it is possible to spot a wind shear by observing a column of smoke. Information on winds at thedifferent levels may not always be available. If not, the aircrew member still can use the best knowndrop altitude and surface winds.4.1.3.  Last minute CARP changes may preclude detailed study of the CARP track by the pilot. Theaircrew member should be prepared to give directions and assist the pilot flying the aircraft in estab-lishing the desired cross track drift offset.4.2.  AF Form 4013 Modified CARP Solution. Use the AF Form 4013, Modified CARP Solution, orMAJCOM approved software for modified CARP solutions. The AF Form 4013 is based on a forwardtravel computation and the formula D=KAV, where D is the drift effect in yards/meters, K is an averageconstant value for the type load being airdropped, A is the drop altitude in feet AGL divided by 1000, andV is the ballistic wind velocity in knots. The AF Form 4013 is designed primarily to provide all the datarequired for an airdrop mission computer (SCNS, INS, GPS, etc.). Figure 4.1., provides an example of afilled-in AF Form 4013:4.2.1.

AF Form 4014, Grid Overlay Plotter, Solution.AFI11-231   31 AUGUST 2005214.3.1.  Description. AF Form 4014 is a clear plastic overlay depicting both grid plotter and genericwind circle cut-outs. The generic wind circle contains two rings scaled to match both the timing graphand the sight angle tables on AF Form 4018 (Reverse). The outer ring is marked with azimuth lines at30 degrees intervals. At the center of the inner circle is a dot used to position the wind circle correctlyon AF Form 4018 (Reverse).4.3.2.  Use of the grid plotter is prescribed later in this instruction. To use the wind circles, clip outalong the dotted line. The loose wind circles can now be overlaid on the AF Form 4018 (Reverse).Using either side of the AF Form 4018, measure FTD back from the depicted PI. Place the dot in thecenter of the wind circles on this point. Turn the wind circles so the surveyed DZ course (on the cir-cles) is overlaid along the DZ axis (depicted on the AF Form 4018). Magnetic or true course can beused depending on whether the aircrew member is using magnetic or true winds to plot the CARP Plotthe drift effect along the wind azimuth. This is your CARP. Converting the CARP to an elapsed timeor a sight angle is discussed in paragraph 4.4.NOTES:The wind circles are calibrated to multiples of 400 yards on the timing graph and multiples of 200yards on the sight angle graph. Use caution when interpolating drift effect.Use formula H (AF Form 4018, CARP Computation). The wind circle size can be converted to a windspeed for ease of inflight plotting.4.4.  Inflight use of AF Form 4018 (Reverse). AF Form 4018 (Reverse) allows for inflight CARP deter-mination. This form depicts a generic drop zone mosaic modified with the addition of a timing graph. Thefrom is designed to be used with the wind circle cut-out from AF Form 4014.4.4.1.  Timing Graph.4.4.1.1.  Plot the PI location on the depicted DZ axis so the bottom of the DZ grid equates to theselected timing point (distance from bottom of grid to block letter equals distance from selectedtiming point to surveyed PI).4.4.1.2.  Plot the CARP in accordance with para. 4.3.4.4.1.3.  Along a line perpendicular to the DZ axis, move the CARP to the column on the rightequating to the aircraft groundspeed.4.4.1.4.  Proceed diagonally along the timing lines to obtain the stopwatch timing. Interpolatebetween whole seconds. Result is the elapsed time from the selected timing point to the releasepoint.NOTE: If the AF Form 4014 overlay is not available, plot the drift effect from the PI location and deter-mine a raw time in accordance with 4.4.1.3. and 4.4.1.4. above. Subtract forward travel time from rawtime to obtain stopwatch time.4.5.  Wind Circle Solution. The wind circle solution is designed to permit the aircrew member to evalu-ate wind conditions very close to the DZ and at levels other than drop altitude. All work in constructingthe wind circle is done on the ground. The drift effect for three or more wind velocities (usually 10, 20 and30 knots) is drawn on the DZ depiction centered on the point of impact, or on the FTD plot. Wind circlesmay also be constructed using any convenient distance increment (usually 200 yards). A true or magnetic22AFI11-231   31 AUGUST 2005north arrow is drawn through the center of the circle with azimuth lines, normally at 30 degree incre-ments, around the circle to facilitate speedy plotting of wind directions. In-flight, the aircrew memberdetermines winds, plots them on the wind circle, and applies FTD (if required) to provide an instanta-neous CARP. It is possible to completely re-evaluate the CARP inside the one-minute advisory.4.5.1.  Preflight4.5.1.1.  Select a properly scaled DZ chart, photograph or drawing. The wind circle may be drawnon clear acetate or similar material for reproduction. These reproductions may be attached to DZphotos for in-flight use.4.5.1.2.  Complete the AF Form 4018. TTF is needed to construct the wind circle, except whenconstant wind circle spacing is used.4.5.1.3.  Determine the drift effect for a 10 knot wind using the formula:               TTF    =     (Drift Effect)               1.78                  104.5.1.4.  Draw circles on the DZ depiction representing the drift effect for selected wind velocitiesup to 40 knots. Wind circles should be centered on the PI. It may be centered on the FTD plot, butan error is induced along the run-in axis for any in-flight change from the original preflight valueof groundspeed used to make the plot. Even though small errors (2.8 yards each second of FTT foreach 5 knots change in preflight CARP groundspeed) are induced by positioning the wind circleson the FTD plot, such errors may be acceptable in relation to possible plotting and computationerrors made possible by attempting to do so inflight.4.5.1.5.  Draw azimuth lines from the PI or FTD plot outward to the outer circle each 30 degreesor selected increment. Label each with the appropriate value. Magnetic values are desirable sinceDZCT winds are passed as magnetic values.4.5.1.6.  Label the DZ depiction or acetate overlay with the constants used to construct the windcircles; i.e., type parachute, load weight, TTF, or size of constant wind circles used. The aircrewmember should always recompute the CARP before each mission to verify the wind values.4.5.1.7.  Plot the preflight drift effect from the PI or FTD plot.4.5.1.8.  Measure the distance from the end of the drift effect plot or the CARP to the timing lineand convert to time using the preflight groundspeed. If the wind circle is centered on the FTD plot,the result is the timing point time. If the wind circle is centered on the PI, subtract the FTT fromthis time. The result is the timing point time.4.5.2.  In-Flight Wind Determination.4.5.2.1.  The wind circle allows aircrew members to average and plot a number of different windswith relative ease and speed. These include surface, intermediate, mean-effective, drop altitude,forecast, and estimated winds. The aircrew member is encouraged to obtain and plot several windsfrom different sources in order to get the best picture possible of actual wind conditions. The deci-sion on which wind or combination of winds to use is up to the individual. Aircrew members mustinsure they compute drop altitude drift and groundspeed for line up and timing. During combatconditions, drift effect is normally plotted based on an average of surface wind indications andnavigation computer readouts.AFI11-231   31 AUGUST 20054.5.3.  Sample Problem:234.5.3.1.

Grid Overlay Solution. The grid overlay solution is a mathematically derived, visual presentationfor rapid computation of a CARP in-flight. Its use is preceded by completing the CARP computations, AFForm 4018. Small deviations from preflight values computed are acceptable. Wind information (GS anddrift), obtained at and below drop altitude, can be used to compute the in-flight CARP. After the finalslowdown and arrival at drop altitude, the CARP can be reconfirmed or adjusted for winds over the DZ.The basic idea of the solution is to provide the aircrew member an instantaneous CARP for any combina-tion of head/tail winds and drift effect.4.6.1.  Preflight:4.6.1.1.  Complete the AF Form 4018. TTF, FTT, and aircraft TAS are needed to construct theoverlay.4.6.1.2.  Determine the cross track drift effect offset, in yards, for two degrees of drift using the"AC" constant, see Figure 4.3. for the values, and the formula:              Chord("AC")      =        (2o Offset Distance)                  1.78                                    TTF            (1.94 for meters)4.6.1.3.  Determine the head/tail wind effect distance, in yards, for 5 knots of wind using the for-mula:                 5    =  (Head/Tail Wind Distance)              1.78                   TTF + FTTNOTE: FTT is added to compensate for changes in the forward travel vector caused by changes ingroundspeed.4.6.1.4.  Select a properly scaled DZ depiction to be used for the airdrop. Insure that all plots usethe corresponding scale. Grid overlays may be drawn on clear acetate or similar material for repro-duction. These reproductions may be attached to DZ photos for in-flight use.4.6.1.5.  Plot the FTD based on drop TAS using the formula:              TAS  =  (FTD)             1.78        FTT4.6.1.6.  Starting with the FTD plot, mark the desired number of 5 knot head/tail wind distancefore and aft of this plot on the run-in axis. A maximum wind circle may be drawn to determine thesize desired; however, five in each direction normally are drawn. Graduations (see (A), Figure4.4. ) are provided to measure the distance between plots and leading edge of the grid overlay plot-ter as a guide for drawing the groundspeed lines.NOTE: Drift angle is accurate only at drop airspeed. The 5kt groundspeed increments represent differ-ences from "CARPed" true airspeed. When off true airspeed a reasonably accurate correction can be madeby applying planned and actual true airspeed differences to the actual groundspeed.4.6.1.7.  On a line perpendicular to the run-in axis and running through one of the head/tail windplots, mark the desired number, normally five, of the 2o offset distances on each side of the axis.The graduations/lines, (see (B), Figure 4.4.) are provided for measuring and drawing the lines.26AFI11-231   31 AUGUST 2005Figure 4.3.

Complete the grid overlay, as shown in Figure 4.4., using the grid overlay plotter.NOTE: The grid overlay may be drawn using dividers to mark all plots (see (C), Figure 4.4.), and thestandard air navigation plotter to draw in the lines. Groundspeed lines are 5o from the perpendicular to therun-in axis (see (D), Figure 4.4.).4.6.1.9.  The line through the FTD plot is a zero head/tail wind effect line and will be labeled withthe computed drop TAS (for any CARP on this line, GS = TAS) or with "0" head/tail wind effect.Succeeding lines will be labeled with the appropriate groundspeed, in 5 knot increments, or withthe appropriate head/tail wind effect (i.e., -5, -10, +5, +10, etc.).NOTE: Labeling head/tail wind effect lines with groundspeed increments normally is the most desirable.It eliminates conversion of Doppler readouts into TAS - GS differences, thereby making last secondchanges to the timing problem simple by having to monitor only a single instrument.4.6.1.10.  Label each parallel drift offset line with the appropriate offset value. Care must be takento label with the correct +/- drift correction (left drift to the right of the DZ and vice versa).4.6.1.11.  Label the grid overlay with the constants used in its construction; Type parachute, loadweight, TTF, FTT, and TAS.4.6.1.12.  Insure the preflight drift effect is plotted from a FTD plot using preflight groundspeed.28AFI11-231   31 AUGUST 20054.6.2.  Sample Problem.

Head/Tail Wind Distance - 154 yards.                 5     =  (154)              1.78        54.84.6.2.4.  Forward Travel Distance - 234 yards.              130  =  (234)              1.78       3.24.6.3.  In-flight Use:4.6.3.1.  The aircrew member will determine from all available sources the effective wind actingupon the parachutist/load from drop altitude to ground level. It will be necessary to convert thismean wind to drift and groundspeed values. The intersection of these two values is the CARP.4.6.3.2.  The aircrew member should be aware that final wind drift values (as read from the gridoverlay) will not necessarily represent the drift value used to determine the heading to fly atrelease. Also, the direct groundspeed readouts of navigation computer systems may not corre-spond to the values which affect the object dropped.4.6.3.3.  One disadvantage of the grid overlay, when used alone, is the time required to convert thewind selected into drift and groundspeed values; however, it does interface with the close-in solu-tion of the CARP using direct navigation computer system readouts, especially in solving the tim-ing problem.4.6.3.4.  Once the CARP is plotted, measure the distance from the timing line to the CARP andconvert it to time (using formula H on the AF Form 4018) to determine timing point time.4.7.  Modified Grid Overlay Solution. The modified grid overlay combines the grid overlay with thewind circle method. It allows the aircrew member to take into account the navigation system supplieddrift and groundspeed, as well as other wind information such as DZCT MEW, surface winds, etc., andproject them on the DZ depiction. A rapid determination of the CARP can be made from this graphic pre-sentation, well within the one-minute advisor.4.7.1.  Preflight:4.7.1.1.  Select a properly scaled DZ chart, photo or drawing.AFI11-231   31 AUGUST 2005294.7.1.2.  Compute a CARP using preflight wind information and the standard computer solution.4.7.1.3.  Construct the grid overlay IAW paragraph 4.6.4.7.1.4.  Draw the wind circle IAW paragraph 4.5. The wind circle is centered on the FTD plotused for the grid overlay.NOTE: An option is to make the wind circle an ellipse. Based on the groundspeed increments at 6 and 12o'clock and the wind circles at 3 and 9 o'clock. This method is the most accurate for drops with high for-ward travel times4.7.1.5.  Plot the preflight ballistic wind using preflight FTD.4.7.1.6.  Convert the distance from the CARP to the timing point to time using preflight ground-speed. Enter this distance and time in the AF Form 4018, Items 33 and 34.4.7.1.7.  The CARP may be plotted using one of three methods:4.7.1.7.1.  Plot the drift effect from the FTD plot computed using preflight (110 knots) ground-speed (see (A), Figure 4.5.).4.7.1.7.2.  Plot the ballistic wind azimuth (200o) and velocity (20 knots) on the wind circle(see (B), Figure 4.5.).4.7.1.7.3.  Plot ballistic wind drift (- 6o) and the groundspeed (114 knots) values using the gridoverlay (see (C), Figure 4.5.).30AFI11-231   31 AUGUST 2005Figure 4.5.  Modified GRID Overlay Sample.NOTE: As indicated, these plots will not necessarily fall at the same point. The only time a commonCARP occurs is when a direct 25 knot head or tail wind is used.4.7.1.8.  To reduce the clutter of the numerous lines drawn on the DZ depiction, it may be desir-able to omit the circles or to plot the Grid and circles in different colors. A quick method to plotwind direction and velocity is available by using the dividers to arc the distance/velocity measuredon the run-in axis (the interval between grid overlay groundspeed lines equals five knots of veloc-ity) to the appropriate azimuth line. Omitting alternating grid overlay line will also reduce clutter,yet provide a usable solution to the wind plotting problem.4.7.1.9.  See Figure 4.5. for a completed solution. Use the same data as paragraph 4.6.2.4.7.2.  In-flight:4.7.2.1.  Plot navigation system drift and groundspeed, surface winds, MEW, and any other avail-able wind information. Evaluate the winds to determine the CARP you plan to use.AFI11-231   31 AUGUST 2005314.7.2.2.  Compute timing point distance using the current or projected groundspeed.4.8.  Timing Graph Solution. The timing graph combines the wind circle and grid overlay methods witha groundspeed-time graph. This provides the aircrew member a form upon which a PI-Timing point con-figuration for any DZ may be constructed. The in-flight CARP can be plotted to allow the aircrew mem-ber to extract a final timing point time quickly. The groundspeed-time graph (Figure 4.6., right hand sideof figure) may be duplicated to use in conjunction with a DZ chart/photo, provided it is constructed usingthe same scale. This form may be best used for use with timing panels or lights. This does not restrict itsuse when timing from any prominent surface feature.4.8.1.  Preflight:4.8.1.1.  Plot the point of impact the required number of yards away from the timing line. The linemay be an extension of timing light/panels or a selected geographical timing point.4.8.1.2.  Complete wind circle, grid overlay or modified grid IAW paragraphs 4.5.,4.6. or 4.7.4.8.1.3.  Predominate DZ features may be annotated to aid line-up.4.8.2.  In-flight:4.8.2.1.  Timing point time may be obtained by plotting the drift effect from the point of impact,proceeding horizontally to groundspeed, then diagonally to timing point time. Subtract the for-ward travel time to obtain actual timing point time. The procedure is recommended since it mini-mizes the forward travel distance error induced by the difference in preflight and actualgroundspeed.4.8.2.2.  Plot the CARP based on FTD and drift effect, proceeding horizontally to groundspeed,then diagonally to timing point time in seconds.NOTE: A negative number indicates a CARP prior to the timing line.4.8.2.3.  The timing graph may be used to compute UDZL.4.8.3.  Sample Problem:4.8.3.1.  Given:4.8.3.1.1.  FTT - 3.2 secs4.8.3.1.2.  TAS - 130 knots4.8.3.1.3.  GS - 110 knots4.8.3.1.4.  W/V - 200o/20 kts4.8.3.1.5.  Drift Effect - 580 yards4.8.4.  The CARP is plotted from the forward travel distance plot and drift effect from the point ofimpact. The offset is the same for both methods, 370 yards left and 16.9 seconds is the resultant timingpoint timing. If the FTD is not plotted, a time of 20.1 seconds would be extracted from the chart.When the FTT of 3.2 seconds is subtracted, the resulting solution is the same 16.9 seconds as in thefirst method. The wind circle, grid overlay or modified grid from the point of impact or FTD plot wasnot shown to avoid confusion.32AFI11-231   31 AUGUST 20054.9.  Other Timing Graphs. Timing graphs may be constructed to be used in conjunction with othertypes of drops using a specific parachute. FTT is the governing factor. Figure 4.6. is an example for per-sonnel (T-10 parachute) which incorporates FTT to provide the aircrew member a final timing point timereadout once drift effect is plotted.4.9.1.  Construction.4.9.1.1.  Refer to Figure 4.6.. A FTT of 3.2 seconds was used to determine the points in construct-ing the one second timing line. Use the formula:              GS (90 and 190)  =      (Distance)                         1.78                4.2(3.2 + 1 sec)4.9.1.2.  Plot and join these distances (212 and 448 yards) on the graph. Repeat procedures foreach additional second; i.e., 5.2, 6.2, etc., or find the yardage for a one second interval using thefollowing formula, then plot succeeding lines:                                                    (Distance)              GS(90 and 190)   =   [51 and 107 yds]                       1.78                            14.9.1.3.  Plot distances as applicable to complete the GS/Time graph. Use the same procedure andapplicable FTT when constructing a graph for other type parachutes.4.9.2.  Preflight. Complete graph using the desired modified CARP solution. Insure the followingrules are followed:4.9.2.1.  Wind Circle - Must be centered on the PI.4.9.2.2.  Grid Overlay - The preflight TAS line is plotted through the PI. Use the following for-mula instead of the formula in paragraph 4.4.1.3.; i.e., do not add FTT to TTF in that formula:                  5    =   (5 Knot Head/Tail Wind Distance)               1.78                             TTF4.9.3.  In-flight. The same data as in paragraph 4.8.3., above was used in this example. Plot drift effect,proceed vertically to the GS (at release) line, then diagonally to the final timing point time. This graphmay be used to convert distance, timing point to the drift effect plot, from a separate DZ depiction pro-vided the same rules as in paragraph 4.9.2., above, are followed on the depiction. Distance may alsobe converted to time, using this graph, when used in conjunction with a grid overlay drawn on the DZdepiction. To do so, measure the distance from the CARP to the timing point, extract timing point timefrom the graph and add FTT.AFI11-231   31 AUGUST 2005Figure 4.6.

Use the formula - Sighting Distance = D = (TAN @) x (A/3)                D = Distance measured directly below the flight deck at the moment the designated target                         intersects an internal reference point.                @ = Angle of inclination from flight deck to designated target                 A = Absolute altitude in feet AGL above the designated targetNOTE: Angle @, is measure using a clinometer or is specified through established techniques for eachaircraft (i.e., the technique for the C-141B is to use an angle of 75.5 degrees when the deck angle is zerodegrees and the top of the aircrew member’s head is against the center overhead panel and is sighting overthe Flight Command Repeater (FCR) box).4.10.1.14.  Given a C-141B with a two degree deck angle and using the formula in paragraph4.10.4, we solve for the following: D = (TAN (75.5 +2)) x (650/3) = 977 yards.36AFI11-231   31 AUGUST 2005Figure 4.8.

The high altitude release point (HARP) solution is a basic CARP solution with the addi-tion of a third (high-velocity, free fall) vector. High altitude-low opening (HALO) drops are primarily per-sonnel drops, although CDS may be dropped using a timer or barometrically actuated second-stageparachute release. The reverse side of the AF Form 4018, CARP Computation, or MAJCOM approvedsoftware product, will be used to solve and record HARP data.Exception: C-17 MC will compute HARP5.2.  Responsibilities:5.2.1.  Compute a HARP for every high altitude airdrop. For multiple passes, recompute the HARPwhenever drop altitude, actuation altitude, or significant wind changes occur. 5.2.2.  An experienced parachutist can maneuver approximately 500 feet horizontally for each 1000feet of free fall. In the event a parachutist cannot maneuver after exiting the aircraft (due to loss ofvisual ground references, injury, unconsciousness, or uncontrollable attitudes), or in the case of equip-ment delivery, an accurate HARP will ensure the load arrives in the vicinity of the intended point ofimpact. Additional modified HARP procedures are included in this chapter.5.2.3.  Due to the altitudes involved in this type of airdrops, visual methods of directing the aircraft tothe HARP are normally less accurate than other electronic methods. These methods include INS/SCNS, GPS, GRADS, radar and radar beacon. All of these systems still require use of HARP compu-tations, but they generally lead to better results. If the objective area or surrounding area is obscured,the airdrops when the ground is obscured there may be no way to steer toward the computed releasepoint. Operational procedures and directives may require use of these systems for high altitude deliv-eries.5.3.  Equipment:5.3.1.  HALO personnel. Personnel parachutes normally used are the MC1, the MC3 Para-Com-mander, the MT1X, and the MT1S Ram-Air. The standard United States Army free fall parachuteassembly (Type AP 28S-3) consists of a main pack and canopy, reserve pack and canopy, and harness.An F-1B automatic ripcord release is incorporated into the assembly to automatically open the para-chute during preplanned jumping. This release allows automatic actuation down to an altitude of4,500 feet. When lower actuation is desired, a modified F-1B, designated the FF-1, can be used. TheFF-1 release can be set for altitudes down to 3,000 feet. The barometric device activates an adjustable0-13 second timer which automatically pulls the ripcord. The FF-2 release is used with the MC3 para-chute. Any of these automatic systems can be used; however, manual ripcord actuation is normal pro-cedure.5.3.2.  HALO CDS:5.3.2.1.  Stabilized. Containers are rigged with a small stabilization parachute which, wheninflated, is used to achieve a high velocity rate of fall, 200+ feet per second, to a selected altitudeAFI11-231   31 AUGUST 200543where a barometric sensing device actuates a timing device and cutter to deploy a larger cargoparachute.5.3.2.2.  Reefed or Confined Ballistic System (CBS). Containers are rigged with a 22 or 28 footring slot, G-12D or similar type cargo parachute which is reefed down to a specific diameter andequipped with one or more dereefing devices. The load descends with the chute in a reefed condi-tion at approximately 130 feet per second until a predetermined burn time has expired and actua-tion of the cutter system occurs. This system cuts the reefing lines, allowing the chute to inflatefully and slow the load descent to approximately 70 feet per second for the 22 or 28 foot ring slotand 26 feet per second for the 12 foot ring slot. 5.3.3.  High Velocity CDS. These loads are rigged with a ring slot parachute and descend at approxi-mately 65-100 feet per second. Loads normally consist of indestructible type supplies which can with-stand the high velocity impact. Normally, staging devices are not utilized.5.3.4.  High Altitude Airdrop Resupply System (HAARS). The HAARS delivers containers from anaircraft flying at altitudes up to 25,000 feet. The containers can be dropped singly or in multiples totwo. Up to 16 containers can be dropped from the C-130 aircraft and up to 40 from the C-141 . Whenthe container leaves the aircraft, a modified 68 inch pilot chute opens and keeps the load upright whileit falls at a terminal velocity of 250 feet per second. when the right altitude is reached, the sensor cutsa sheer web. This allows a cargo parachute to open and the load to land at an acceptable rate of speed.5.4.  Basic Assumptions. The deployment altitude obtained from the jumpmaster is considered to be thealtitude where full parachute deployment occurs and a constant rate of descent is established. Actuationaltitude (for manual ripcord pull) is normally considered to be 500 feet above the deployment altitude.The aircrew member should confirm which altitude, deployment or actuation, corresponds to the altitudefigure received. When the FF-1, FB-1, or similar device is used for HALO CDS, actuation altitude is thealtitude at which the ripcord/cutter starts deployment of the second stage parachute.5.5.  Altitudes:5.5.1.  Pressure altitude or indicated true altitude is used as the aircraft drop altitude reference. Thedrop altitude and actuation altitude must be converted to absolute altitudes for HARP computations.Indicated altitude is the altitude to be flown with an externally supplied (surface) DZ altimeter setting.Pressure altitude is the altitude to be flown with an altimeter setting of 29.92.5.5.2.  The HALO parachutist can use any of three altimeter types to determine desired parachuteactuation/deployment altitude:5.5.2.1.  An adjustable pressure altimeter with a Kollsman window. This enables parachutists tomanually activate their own parachute, based on indicated true altitude or indicated pressure alti-tude.5.5.2.2.  An adjustable pressure altimeter without Kollsman window. The parachutist will usuallyadjust this type of altimeter so that it displays altitudes with respect to point of impact elevation.This enables parachutist to normally activate their own parachute, based on indicated altitudeabove ground level. This is the most common method used by US Army personnel.5.5.2.3.  A non-adjustable pressure altimeter (29.92 in Hg/1013.2 Mb). This enables parachutiststo manually activate their own parachute, based on indicated pressure altitude.44AFI11-231   31 AUGUST 20055.6.  Wind Determination:5.6.1.  There are two winds used in HARP computations:5.6.1.1.  Ballistic Wind. The vectorial average of the winds from drop altitude to actuation altitudeor ground level when single stage drops are made.5.6.1.2.  Deployed Wind. The vectorial average of the winds from actuation altitude to the ground.5.6.2.  Normally, the weather forecaster is not trained to calculate the vectorial average of winds;therefore, the aircrew member should request winds at the required altitudes and compute the average.Ballistic winds are computed using winds for every 2,000 feet from drop altitude down; deployedwinds are computed using winds for ever 1,000 feet or less from actuation altitude down to the sur-face.5.7.

SCNS requires Deployed Rateof Fall, High Velocity Rate of Fall, Deceleration Time, Deceleration Distance, Vertical Distance, Timeof Fall Constant, and Forward Travel Time. All other items SCNS requires to compute its HARP solu-tion can be found on the AF Form 4017.54Figure 5.2.  HARP Diagram.AFI11-231   31 AUGUST 2005AFI11-231   31 AUGUST 2005Figure 5.3.  AF Form 4017 Sample. 5556AFI11-231   31 AUGUST 20055.12.  Modified High Altitude High Opening (HAHO) General. The  square  ram-air  parachutesHAHO jumpers use have considerable maneuverability and forward speed. The ram-air parachute designis an air inflated airfoil allowing it to glide in a controlled direction. The jumper operates hand controlsthat allow turns and attitude changes. Square parachutes have approximately a 8:1 glide ratio; even in stillair, these parachutes can travel at a forward speed of 20.8 knots. Three square parachutes are currently inuse. The MT1-X is a 7 cell, 370 ft2 canopy with a maximum suspended weight of 450 lbs. It has the slow-est descent rate and the highest glide ratio. For this reason, it is normally selected as the main canopy. TheMT1-S is slightly smaller (5 cell, 280 ft2 and a maximum suspended weight of 350 lbs) than the MT1-Xand is normally used as the reserve parachute. The MT1 is the smallest chute (7 cell, 270 ft2 and a maxi-mum suspended weight of 350 lbs) and has the highest rate of descent. The total time of fall determineshow far a parachutist can travel, consequently, the higher the drop absolute altitude, the greater the dis-tance the jumper(s) can travel.5.12.1.  Release Point Considerations. The parachute drive distance is computed at 20.8 knots. In a nowind condition, the drop could be made anywhere inside an imaginary circle with radius equal to thedrive distance, and centered on the intended point of impact, Figure 5.4. However, wind adds driftdistance upwind of the PI, so the drop circle is shifted upwind the distance of the wind drift, figure5.4b. The PI will be inside the circle unless the average wind speed exceeds the parachute's forwarddrive velocity of 20.8 knots. On a drop outside of the circle, the parachute drive will not overcome thewind drift, so the jumper cannot reach the PI.5.12.2.  There are two methods of computing a HAHO solution. The first is as follows:5.12.2.1.  The acceptable release area is a circle within which it is possible for the jumper to exitthe aircraft and reach the objective area. In a no-wind situation, this area will be centered on theend of the forward travel vector and will have a radius equal to the no-wind parachute glide dis-tance. In a wind condition, two separate computations must be performed. First, compute ano-wind glide distance using “X” in the formula below. Then make another computation using“V” in the same formula. This gives the required distance to move the center of the acceptablerelease area UPWIND from the PI. A no-wind acceptable release area will be precomputed foreach planned drop altitude and will be recomputed for any change in drop altitude. A maximumglide distance will be computed for each drop and will be expressed in nautical miles upwindalong the average ballistic wind vector.5.12.2.2.  Use the following formula and contents to compute the HAHO acceptable release area:(A-2)(V or X)/K = Maximum glide distance in nautical milesA = AGL drop altitude in thousands of feet (item 7 of AF Form 4015).V = Wind speed in knotsX = Parachute forward speed (20.8)K = 48 for MT1X parachutes       60 for MT1S parachutes       66 for MT1 parachutesWind drift distance = (A-2)(V/K)Acceptable release area radius = (A-2)(X/K)AFI11-231   31 AUGUST 200557(X/K) = .43333 for MT1X parachute           = .34666 for MT1S parachute           = .31515 for MT1 parachute5.12.2.3.  Use a standard 300 meter forward travel vector.5.12.3.  The second HAHO solution method is as follows:              D = (A - SF) x(20.8 + V)                             K x 1000D = Total Drive Distance in nautical milesA = Absolute Altitude in feetSF = Safety Factor in feet (A safety buffer from exit to assembly of parachutists under canopy and forassembly at a certain altitude once the "flight" arrives over the drop zone, normally 2,000; 1,000 feetfor assembly and 1,000 feet for approach).20.8 = A Constant for parachute forward velocityV = Average Wind Velocity in knotsK = Parachute Glide Constant:            = 48 (MT1-X)            = 60 (MT1-S)            = 66 (MT1)NOTE: The aircrew member must calculate for the lowest performance parachute. If the jumpers areusing MT1-X main canopies, but MT1-S reserves, calculate total drive distance using the lower perfor-mance (higher K factor) parachute glide constant (i.e., use K = 60 in the above example).58AFI11-231   31 AUGUST 2005Figure 5.4.  HAHO Drive Distance Example.5.12.3.1.  Required Radial HAHO Computations. Tactics may dictate that drops cannot be madeon the upwind line. In a situation where the release location is determined by a restricted area, bor-der, or threat ring, plan to drop on a "required radial," figure 5.4c. Pick a radial or sector centeredon the point of impact and passing through the allowed area for release. Plot area on a 1:250,000scale chart or larger. Solve the wind drift vector (in nautical miles) using the formula:D = (A - SF) X (V)           K x 1000AFI11-231   31 AUGUST 200559Plot the wind drift vector on the chart upwind of the point of impact.  Next, solve the drive dis-tance (in nautical miles):D = (A - SF) X (20.8)          K x 1000Use the drive distance as a radius and plot from the end of the wind line.  If the circle crosses therequired radial or sector in an area where the drop can be done, then you have an acceptable solu-tion.5.12.3.2.  Plotting Instructions:5.12.3.2.1.  Select a properly scaled chart (1:250,000 scale or larger scale is recommended).5.12.3.2.2.  Plot the total drive distance upwind of the PI using the averaged wind vector. Ifthere is a significant change in wind direction (i.e., a wind shear), it may be necessary to com-pute the drive distance as two rather than one vector. Should this occur, inform the jumpmasterof where the shear occurs and the desired dogleg headings to optimize drive distance.NOTE: The aircrew member must examine the parachutists' descent profile in relation to surroundingterrain, if intervening terrain exists, an alternate approach to the drop zone may be required.5.12.3.2.3.  Move the plot the computed FTD in the reciprocal direction of the run-in course tocompensate for forward throw. This is the release point.5.12.4.  In-flight AF Form 4015 Completion Requirements.

All other items SCNS requires to com-pute its HARP solution can be found on the AF Form 4017.62AFI11-231   31 AUGUST 20055.13.  Modified High Altitude Low Opening (HALO) General. Modified High Altitude Low Opening(HALO) personnel airdrops are similar to a basic CARP solution with an additional free fall/high velocityvector. The MT1 Ram-Air and MC-1/3 paracommander parachutes are normally used. When the Ram-Airparachutes are used, a combination of HAHO and HALO solutions are used in computing the HARP.When the MC-1/3 paracommanders are used, the standard D = KAV/1000 formula may be applied tocompute the high velocity and deployed vectors to solve the HARP.5.13.1.  Release Point Considerations. Regardless of the type of parachute used, the high velocity/freefall drift vector is computed using D = KAV/1000, where K equals a ballistic constant equal to three.The ram-air parachute drive distance is computed as in a HAHO solution using the actuation altitudeminus the desired approach altitude. This is an accurate approximation of drift/drive the parachute iscapable of in determining the HARP. The same wind velocity considerations discussed in paragraph5.12.1. apply. The MC-1/3 paracommanders are round steerable parachutes with limited maneuveringcapability. Since these parachutes lack the performance of the ram-air parachutes, the computed drift/drive under canopy is considerably less. Compute the deployed drift using D = KAV/1000, with K =25, and A equal to the actuation altitude, in feet, above ground level. When using the D = KAVmethod, the forward travel vector must be applied to the equation to determine the HARP.5.13.2.  HALO Computations:5.13.2.1.  The formula D = KAV/1000 is an accurate approximation of drift effect where:D = drift effect in metersK = a ballistic constantA = altitude in feetV = average wind velocityWARNING: The forward travel vector must be applied to the D = KAV equation to accurately determinethe HARP.WARNING: The D = KAV/1000 method can be used to compute personnel HALO release points whenMC1-1 and MC1-3 parachutes are used. Use the AF Form 4015 to compute and record HARP computa-tion data. When the MT1-X, MT1-S, or MT1 ram-air parachutes are used, a modification of the HAHOformula can be used to calculate the deployed drift/drive, see paragraph 5.3.2.3. Method used will bedetermined between the aircrew member and the jumpmaster prior to takeoff.5.13.2.2.  MC-1/3 parachutes:5.13.2.2.1.  The HARP computation is divided into three components:5.13.2.2.1.1.  .High velocity drift effect (HVDE). Determined by computing the averagewind velocity and direction from exit to opening altitude and using the formula D = KAV/1000, where K = 3.5.13.2.2.1.2.  Deployed drift effect (DDE). Determined by computing the average windvelocity and direction from activation altitude to the ground and using the formula D =KAV/1000, where K = 25.5.13.2.2.1.3.  Forward travel distance (FTD). Computed using Item 25, 26 and formula Con the AF Form 4015.5.13.2.3.  Ram-Air Parachutes:AFI11-231   31 AUGUST 2005635.13.2.3.1.  The HARP computation is divided into three components:5.13.2.3.1.1.  The high velocity/free fall vector is computed as in paragraph 5.13.2.2.1.1.and the formula D = KAV/1000 as described above.5.13.2.3.1.2.  Deployed drift effect is computed using the HAHO formula:D = (A - SF) x (20.8 + V)               K x 1000D = Drive distance in nmA = Actuation altitude, in feet, above ground levelSF = Safety Factor, in feet (a safety buffer to enable the parachutist to maneuver for DZapproach and landing).20.8 = A constant for parachute forward velocityV = Average wind velocity in knotsK = Parachute glide constant:       = 48 (MT1-X)       = 60 (MT1-S)       = 66 (MT1)Since this equation yields a result in NM, it may be desirable to convert this to meters forease of plotting (1nm = 1852 meters). NOTE: The aircrew member must calculate for the lowest performance parachute. If the jumpers areusing MT1-X main canopies, but MT1-S reserves, calculate total drive distance using the lower perfor-mance (higher K factor) parachute glide constant (i.e., use K = 60 in the above example).5.13.2.3.1.3.  Forward travel distance (FTD). Computed using Item 25, 26, and formula Con the AF Form 4015.5.13.3.  Plotting Instructions:5.13.3.1.  Select a properly scaled chart (1:50,000 scale or larger scale is recommended).5.13.3.2.  Plot the total DDE upwind of the PI using the averaged deployed wind vector.5.13.3.3.  Plot the HVDE upwind from the deployed drift effect plot.5.13.3.4.  Move the plot the computed FTD in the reciprocal direction of the run-in course to com-pensate for forward throw. This is the release point.5.13.4.  Inflight AF Form 4015 Completion Requirements. Use the AF Form 4015, High AltitudeRelease Point Considerations, to solve and record in-flight personnel HARP data. Obtain and recordactual in-flight winds, the ballistic winds (averages) used to compute the HARP, and the groundspeedand drift at drop altitude.5.13.5.  Sample Problems. Figure 5.2., columns 2 and 3, includes a representative HALO solution forboth the ram-air, and paracommander parachutes.5.13.5.1.

Modified High Altitude CDS, General. High altitude container delivery system airdrops may beconducted as single or two-stage deliveries. A single stage delivery consists of load rigged with a stabiliz-ing, high velocity or reefed parachute that allows the load to descend at approximately 65-250 feet persecond. A high velocity CDS, or BLU-82 are examples of single stage airdrops. A two-stage delivery con-sists of a load rigged with a stabilizing, or reefed parachute allowing the load to descend at approximately65-250 feet per second to a selected altitude. Once this altitude is reached, a barometric sensing deviceactuates a timing device or cutter to deploy a larger cargo parachute, or dereef the partially inflated cargoparachute. The confined ballistic system (CBS) and high altitude airdrop resupply system (HAARS) usetwo-stage recoveries.5.14.1.  High Altitude CDS Computations.

Ground Radar Aerial Delivery System (GRADS) , General. GRADS was developed to providean all weather system for aerial delivery using a ground radar to position the aircraft at an air release point.This system is currently not in use. However, this paragraph will serve as an historic document for futureoperational use. Two radar systems are available for positioning, the SEEK POINT (TBP-1) and the SKYSPOT (MSQ-77 or equivalent). The SKY SPOT is the radar system used during RBS-directed airdrops.6.1.1.  GRADS Terms:6.1.1.1.  Acquisition Point. A preplanned point at which the ground based radar will acquire theaircraft and commence guidance. 6.1.1.2.  Miss Distance. The lateral distance from the planned CARP or HARP to the aircraft'sactual position at release, as measured by the ground radar providing guidance.6.1.2.  GRADS Procedures:6.1.2.1.  Complete the applicable CARP or HARP computations. When plotting FTD and drifteffect on a graph or a DZ depiction with a meter scale, it may be desirable to convert these values,in yards, to meters by using the formula:               .914 = (meters)                1.0        yards6.1.2.2.  Plot the CARP or HARP and determine its position in terms used by the radar controller.See Figure 6.1.6.1.2.2.1.  SEEK POINT: The aircraft position will be expressed in distance north or south anddistance east or west from the PI. Insure the position is based on true cardinal directions. Sincethe winds and course used on the AF Form 4018 are magnetic, draw a magnetic north line onthe depiction for use in plotting wind vectors and the DZ axis.6.1.2.2.2.  SKY SPOT: The aircraft position will be expressed as true bearing and distance tothe PI.6.1.2.3.  The selection of the type DZ depiction is left up to the navigator and may be based onavailability of map, photo, etc., coverage. Graph paper is acceptable, especially for IMC or nightdrops when ground features are obscured or unavailable and when aircraft altitude limits their use-fulness.6.1.3.  Sample Problem:           DZ Axis = 360o Mag or 010o True           Drop Wind Direction = 044o Mag           Drift Effect =300 yds(274 meters)           FTD = 212 yds (194 meters)AFI11-231   31 AUGUST 200571The CARP for the SEEK POINT controller would be relayed as 34 meters south, 191 meters east.The same CARP will be relayed to a SKY SPOT controller as 100o at 627 feet.  Specific terminologywill be IAW operational procedures.Figure 6.1.  GRADS Graph Sample.6.2.  Radar Beacon Delivery Procedures, General. Radar I, J and K-Band transponder beacons providea positive means to locate, recognize and align on the DZ, LZ, or RZ. Airborne radar approaches and air-drops can be accomplished successfully by using the beacon as a terminal reference. Note: C-17s, seeT.O. 1C-17A-1-2 for Radar Beacon Delivery Procedures.6.2.1.  Beacons are omni-directional or directional, depending on beacon and mode selected. Normalaircrew procedures for airdrop and airland are not affected by the use of radar beacons as a terminalreference.6.2.2.  Equipment:72AFI11-231   31 AUGUST 20056.2.2.1.  The SST-181X (UPN-25) radar beacon transponder is a line-of-sight receiver and pulsetransmitter operating in the I-Band frequency range. The radar beacon provides identification byeither a coded pair of output pulses or a single pulse. The double pulse can be coded with distancesbetween pulses from 4 to 12 nm. This provides 10 different combinations which the receptioncommittee can set to control the pulse coding that appears on the aircraft radar. When double pulseis used, the innermost radar return is used for range and bearing determination. The outermostreturn is for authentication.6.2.2.2.  The GAR/I radar beacon transponder is a line-of-sight receiver and pulse transmitteroperating in the I, and K-Band frequency ranges. A Ka-Band signal triggers the transmitter whichresponds with a series of I-Band pulses. The first pulse provides range and bearing, the subsequentpulses (up to four) are for authentication. The transponder is set for horizontal and linear polariza-tion and has an antenna pattern of 25 degrees azimuth and 50 degrees elevation either side of cen-terline. Effective range is 20 nm under optimum conditions.6.2.2.3.  The PPN-19 radar beacon transponder is a line-of-sight receiver and pulse transmitteroperating in the I, K, or J-Band frequency ranges. The PPN-19 can provide omni-directional ordirectional radiation capability. There are seven operator selectable codes, and four selectabletransmit modes. The PPN-19 can receive and transmit in I-Band, J-Band, I and J-Bands simulta-neously, or receive K-band and transmit in I-Band (GAR/I). The first pulse provides range andbearing, with subsequent pulses provided for authentication.6.2.3.  Problems and Solutions:6.2.3.1.  Scope ringing should be anticipated at close range to the SST-181X (UPN-25) beacon.This phenomenon is caused by the increased energy received from the beacon at close range.Scope ringing can be minimized by reducing radar gain and adjusting antenna tilt. Ringing isdependent upon a multitude of factors; however, as a general rule of thumb, ringing can beexpected at the following ranges for the selected altitudes:ALT (AGL)1,500 feet1,200 feet1,000 feet500 feet300 feet150 feetRANGE1.5 nm1.0 nm0.8 nm0.6 nm0.5 nm0.1 nmAnticipation of scope ringing is important for two reasons.  First, it is necessary to be establishedon the final drift corrected heading prior to scope ringing.  Second, release timing for airdropsmust begin before the radar pulse is obscured by ringing.  Therefore, timing for  release shouldbegin, or the final update for AUTOCARP should be inserted, before the beacon return starts toring.  Timing should be initiated or restarted at the nearest forward range to improve accuracy.6.2.3.2.  Slant range versus ground range needs to be clearly understood.  Slant range is thestraight line distance between the aircraft and target.  Ground range is the distance from the pointon the earth's surface directly below the aircraft to the target.  The radar provides slant range.AFI11-231   31 AUGUST 200573Unfortunately, ground range is required for beacon computations.  The slant range correction dis-tance for various altitudes and ranges is listed in Figure 6.2.NOTE: Applies to slant-range radar displays only.6.2.4.  Beacon Placement and Timing:6.2.4.1.  Standard beacon placement procedures for the ground reception committee are in JointPublication 3-05.1. The tactical environment will frequently require modification of these stan-dard placements. Ensure that both the ground reception committee and the aircrews are briefedwhere beacons are placed.6.2.4.2.  Timing Point Timing. Because the possibility for scope ringing exists, timing point timingto the release point must be calculated for pessimistic and optimistic ranges (normally 2 and 1nm).NOTE: The APQ-170 radar set (MC-130H) corrects the beacon return to ground range prior to display,using standard beacon delay values (1.0 microseconds for I-band, 0.3 microseconds for J-band). There-fore, no range correction is required unless a non-standard beacon delay is used.6.2.4.3.  Sample Problem:Drop Alt = 1000 feet AGLDrop Groundspeed = 130 knots6.2.4.3.1.

BLU-82B/C-130 Weapon System Delivery Procedures, General. The BLU-82B/C-130 weaponsystem, nicknamed Commando Vault, is the high altitude delivery of a 15,000 pound general purposebomb from a C-130. This system depends upon the accurate positioning of the aircraft by either a fixedground radar or onboard navigation equipment. The ground radar controller or aircrew navigator as appli-cable, is responsible for positioning the aircraft prior to final countdown and release. Primary aircrew con-siderations include accurate ballistic and wind computations provided by the navigator, and precisioninstrument flying with strict adherence to controller instructions. The minimum altitude for release due toblast effects of the weapon is 6,000 feet AGL. A HARP will be completed by the aircrew for each dropusing the procedures in Chapter 5 and as outlined below.6.3.1.  Computations:6.3.1.1.  The AF Form 4018, Computed Air Release Point Computations, will be used to solve theHARP. Generally, the same procedures apply as for other single stage high velocity drops (refer toChapter 5 for form completion requirements).6.3.1.2.  The determination of a mean effective ballistic wind involves averaging of both azimuthand velocity at intermediate altitudes between drop altitude and the surface to determine the ballis-tic wind to be used in the release point computation.6.4.  C-130 Sight Angle Airdrop Technique. Sight angle dropping is based on a visual release using thepoint of impact marking as the visual computed air release point. A basic understanding of the sight angledropping theory is necessary to grasp the concept of airdropping from different altitudes. These tech-niques are provided as a basis to work from and do not preclude units from modifying or developing alter-nate methods.6.4.1.  The theory behind sight angle dropping is the geometrical triangle. The three sides of the trian-gle are the altitude above the point of impact, the release point distance short of the point of impactand the line of sight from the aircraft to the point of impact, Figure 6.3. The angle used to determinethe release point is the angle formed by the sides "line of sight" and "altitude above PI", Figure 6.3.The "altitude above PI" is calculated by adding the drop altitude to the drop zone highest elevationminus the point of impact elevation, or by using the "altitude above point of impact" from Item 14 onthe AF Form 4018. The "distance short of PI" is the airdrop forward travel distance corrected for thewind vector. Once the altitude above the PI and the distance short of the PI are determined, the sightangle may be calculated. 6.4.2.  Preflight:6.4.2.1.  Compute the (CARP) on the AF Form 4018 as normal.6.4.2.1.1.  Plot the location of the CARP relative to the PI on a blank sheet of paper (or graphpaper if available) using any appropriate scale.6.4.2.1.2.  Determine the distance (in yards) the CARP falls prior to, or after, the PI. Thisbecomes the CARP distance or forward travel distance corrected for wind.6.4.2.2.  Depression Angle Calculations Method One:6.4.2.2.1.  Figure 6.4. gives the depression angle for a given forward travel distance and alti-tude above the point of impact. Enter the chart with both the distance above the PI and the for-ward travel distance corrected for wind. The resultant angle is the sight angle or depressionangle for the airdrop.76AFI11-231   31 AUGUST 2005NOTE: For CDS drops where the aircraft is normally flown with 7o nose up attitude, you must subtractthis deck angle from the angle extracted from Figure 6.4.6.4.2.2.2.  Translate this angle to a visible reference in the cockpit. There are numerous waysto do this; marking the foot pedal windows with a grid to equate to yardage, using either a plot-ter or a clinometer to measure the angle and mark the reference point with a grease pencil orvisual aid marker. The easiest method for measuring the angle in the cockpit is by using theplotter. All that is required is the plotter, string and a weight. Set up the plotter by threading thestring through the center of the plotter and tie the weight to the string. The plotter is properlyset up if when looking horizontally down the edge of the plotter, the weighted string measures90 degrees on the plotter compass and 0 degrees looking vertically at the ground.6.4.2.3.  Depression Angle Calculations Method Two:6.4.2.3.1.  At the aircraft, determine the airdrop sight angle using a simple ratio:eye altitude above the ground*    =     pace distance     planned airdrop altitude                  CARP distNOTE: Eye altitude above the ground is the sum of the height of the aircraft floor and the navigator'sheight in his airdrop crouch or whatever position he plans to release from. All C-130s are 7'11" from cock-pit floor to tarmac. Example: With the navigator's head next to the corner of the flight engineer's overheadpanel, his eye is 5'7" from the floor. Therefore, use 13.5' as eye altitude above the ground.AFI11-231   31 AUGUST 2005Figure 6.3.  Sight Angle Triangle.7778AFI11-231   31 AUGUST 2005Figure 6.4.  Depression Angle Chart.6.4.2.3.2.  Compute and record the pace distance for personnel or equipment airdrops using theratio described above.NOTE: For CDS airdrops, a correction must be applied for the increased deck angle. For CDS airdropsat 600 feet AGL, subtract 128 yards from the CARP distance plot and compute pace distance, asdescribed.AFI11-231   31 AUGUST 2005796.4.2.3.3.  Starting at the aircraft forward jack stand location, measure the pace distance, deter-mined using the formula described above, and mark the position with a checklist, briefcase orwhatever (either step it off or know the size of the ramp concrete squares). Repeat the proce-dure, pacing the same distance at an angle as shown in Figure 6.5.(the angle selected is notcritical, but must be sufficient to account for any expected aircraft drift on approach to theDZ). The two markers can be referred to as “scaling markers.”6.4.2.3.4.  With the two scaling markers in place, return to the aircraft cockpit. With your headin the same position from which the airdrop will be made (e.g., against the bend in the flightengineer's overhead panel), sight through the appropriate window to the first scaling marker.Place a grease pencil mark on the window at the intersection point. Repeat this for the otherscaling marker. Connect the two window grease pencil marks with a line (note that the lineslopes up somewhat from the nose of the aircraft to the aft). This is the "green light" line forthat particular airdrop.6.4.2.3.5.  To avoid having to scramble when in-flight conditions change the CARP location,one technique is to reaccomplish the appropriate steps for groundspeeds ten knots higher andlower than planned. Plot the 10 knot high and low "green light" adjustment lines above andbelow the preflight "green light" line. You may also consider repeating the above proceduresfor the left side of the cockpit as well.6.4.2.4.  Inflight Actions. The navigator updates the CARP location and advises the pilot of therevised location. The pilot is responsible for maintaining the desired lateral displacement offset.The navigator makes minor corrections to his "green light" line and positions himself in the air-drop position on which the preflight was based. He watches the PI or timing point and call "greenlight" or starts his stopwatch timing when the point passes through the line.6.4.2.5.  Error Sensitivity. Accurately positioning the aircraft at the release point is the most criti-cal phase of the airdrop mission. Sight angle airdrop methods reduce the possibility of gross air-drop errors; however, the sight angle method is only as accurate as the geometry used. Examplesof error and resultant effect on aircraft positioning relative to the PI include:6.4.2.5.1.  Head Positioning.

Placement of Scaling Markers.6.5.  Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) Airdrop Techniques (MC-130).6.5.1.  General. The FLIR may be used to determine the release point on blind or marked DZs as theprimary airdrop method or as an alternative to a planned AUTOCARP. Improved accuracy on airdropscan be obtained by performing the line-up visually and accomplishing the release on the FLIR.6.5.2.  Preflight Procedures. Complete the AF Form 4018 IAW Chapter 3. Plot the CARP. Convertthe 10 second warning time to yards using formula H and enter the result at the bottom of the column,Figure 6.7. Plot the location of the 10 second warning on the DZ diagram, if able. Divide Items 31 and32 in two as shown in Figure 6.7. The top half of each item is used for the 10 second warning and thebottom half for the CARP. If these items are already in use for visual timing information, use an adja-cent column for the FLIR data. Using all available imagery and chart information and the criteriabelow, select FLIR targets for line-up and release and annotate on a DZ photo, mosaic, diagram, orrun-in chart (JOG or larger scale preferred):6.5.2.1.  Line-up Targets. The line-up targets chosen must be prominent enough to allow positiveidentification early enough to allow final line-up corrections to be made using the FLIR alone,making allowance for the limited field of view and the difficulty of judging aircraft track relativeto the FLIR monitor presentation. The line-up targets may be beyond the PI, short of the PI, or thePI itself. If available, select two or more line-up targets so that the line-up may be judged by com-paring their relative positions. Additional targets between the IP and the DZ should also beselected as an aid in maintaining course centerline and acquiring the DZ.AFI11-231   31 AUGUST 2005816.5.2.2.  Release Targets. The 10 second warning and release may be accomplished by one of threemethods; depression angle (Figure 6.6.), azimuth (Figure 6.7.), or timing (Figure 6.8.). Differentmethods and targets may be required for the 10 second warning and the CARP, depending on thelocation of each. Depression angle is the primary method. The azimuth method is used to avoid thepossibility of not reaching the calculated depression angle due to a line-up error when the 10 sec-ond warning location or the CARP is too close to the FLIR target. To determine which method touse, plot two lines from the FLIR target at 50 degrees either side of the DZ course (Figure 6.7.,and Figure 6.8.). Use the azimuth method to determine the 10 second warning or the CARP ifeither falls in the sectors abeam the target, otherwise use the depression angle method. The timingmethod is least preferred and should only be used when adequate targets are not available in theDZ area or when the depression angles for either the 10 second warning or the CARP are less thanapproximately 10 degrees. Because of the high groundspeed and low drop altitude (resulting in alow FLIR depression angle) used for HSLLADS, the timing method is best suited for determiningthe HSLLADS 10 second warning.6.5.2.2.1.  Depression Angle Method. Select an easily identifiable target as close to DZ center-line as possible. Measure the direct distance, in yards, from the FLIR target to the 10 secondwarning location or the CARP and enter in Item 31. Using the corresponding distance in Item31, obtain the depression angle value of the warning or the CARP from Figure 6.4., subtractthis value from 90 degrees, and enter the result in Item 32 as appropriate (Figure 6.6.).6.5.2.2.2.  Azimuth Method. Enter "AZ" in Item 31, in the section (10 second warning orCARP) that the azimuth method is used for. Measure the relative bearing to the FLIR target atthe 10 second warning or CARP location and enter along with the direction in Item 32 (Figure6.7.).6.5.2.2.3.  Timing Method. Select an easily identifiable target between the 10 second warninglocation and not more than two minutes prior to the CARP. Calculate the distance in yardsfrom abeam the target to the warning location or CARP and enter in Item 31. Convert this dis-tance to timing point time using formula H and enter in Item 32. If both the warning and theCARP will be determined using the timing method, omit the top half of Item 31 and computethe top half of Item 32 by subtracting 10 seconds from the bottom half of Item 32 (Figure6.8.).6.5.3.  Inflight Procedures.WARNING: The MC-130E FLIR turret is not stabilized for pitch, roll or drift. Elevation and azimuthreadings will be accurate only during straight and level flight. Track angle error must be applied to turretazimuth when checking DZ alignment. If the aircraft pitch angle at release can be determined during mis-sion planning, the aircraft pitch angle should be added algebraically to the planned depression angle.Example: If aircraft pitch angle is 7 degrees nose up, and the depression angle from Figure 6.4. is 18 degrees, then the corrected depression angle is 25 degrees. After the slowdown or three minute warning, the left navigator plots the CARP and 10 second warning location (if it falls on the DZ diagram) using the best available wind information. The navigator acquires the line-up target(s) on FLIR and provides the pilot with headings to the CARP.6.5.3.1.  Depression Angle or Azimuth Method. The navigator obtains either the depression angleor relative bearing for the warning location and CARP and records these values on the AF Form4018. Using a grease pencil, the right navigator marks the face of the FLIR turret position indica-82AFI11-231   31 AUGUST 2005tor with depression angle and relative bearing for the warning and the CARP, acquires the releasetarget on the FLIR, and maintains it in the center of the FLIR monitor. The navigator monitors theturret position indicators and calls the 10 second warning and the release when the indicators passthe respective elevation or azimuth marks (Figure 6.6. and Figure 6.7.).6.5.3.2.  Timing Method. The navigator calculates the distance from abeam the target to the 10second warning location or CARP, recalculates the timing point time based on in-flight ground-speed, and records these values on the AF Form 4018. The right navigator acquires the target onthe FLIR and maintains it in the center of the FLIR monitor. The navigator monitors the turretposition indicator, begins timing abeam the timing target, and calls the 10 second warning andrelease based upon stopwatch timing.Figure 6.6.

HC-130 Rescue Airdrop Procedures.6.6.1.  Introduction. A capability to deliver medical personnel, survival gear, and supplies is importantto keeping a survivor on the ground viable until a rescue can be effected. HC-130 aircrews maintainAFI11-231   31 AUGUST 200585qualification to airdrop personnel and rescue equipment during peacetime and contingencies using avariety of available procedures, depending on the situation.6.6.2.  HC-130 Airdrop Options.6.6.2.1.  Threat Environment. During contingencies, avoiding/minimizing detection and time nearthe survivor location may be a mission requirement, depending on the location and intensity of thethreat relative to the location of the survivor. In an environment where the threat is unknown orwhen it dictates that a single pass over the survivor is desirable to airdrop pararescue personnel(PJs) and/or equipment, Computed Air Release Point (CARP)/High Altitude Release Point(HARP) procedures will likely be employed6.6.2.2.  Non-Threat/Threat-Suppressed. In situations where multiple passes over a survivor areacceptable, standard rescue airdrop procedures have historically proven to be an effective meansto deploy PJs and/or rescue-related equipment to a survivor. A variety of patterns to deploy per-sonnel and/or deliver equipment to the survivor may be flown, depending on wind and sea condi-tions, terrain, weather, and load to be delivered.6.6.3.  Equipment Delivery ParametersRescue equipment may be deployed with MA-1/2 Kits, dropped as para-bundles, or dropped free-fall.Each of these will be discussed. Typical chute types, drop altitudes, and load weight capacities for thisequipment are listed below.Figure 6.9.

The aircraft will be maneuvered at 150 KIAS or below in a racetrack pattern(aircraft may be flown on autopilot). Deployment airspeed is 125 KIAS. Static line deployments atairspeeds above 130 KIAS are prohibited due to parachute limitations.6.6.4.3.  Surface Wind Limits.6.6.4.3.1.  Static Line - 13 knots for land, 22 knots for water, 17 knots for tree penetrationjumps.6.6.4.3.2.  HGRP - 17 knots for land, 25 knots for water, 22 knots for tree penetration jumps.6.6.4.4.  Crew Duty Differences From C-130E/H Airdrop Mission. 6.6.4.4.1.  Spotting Device Requirements. Spotter chute/streamer deployments prior toPJ-directed airdrops are required. Spotting devices may be either chute or streamer. The spot-ter chute used by USAF pararescuemen is the standard J-1 (12 foot diameter) wind-drift deter-mination parachute. The spotter chute weight can be one provided by the PJ or a MK 6 MOD3 smoke. Streamers are 20 foot lengths of crepe paper weighted on one end with a 3/4 to 1ounce metal rod.6.6.4.5.  Fixed Target Pattern.In most cases, PJs will deploy to a stationary (fixed) target. The normal flight pattern will be aracetrack pattern, with the final approach extending from the spotting device to the target. The pat-tern must be large enough to allow for heading corrections on final approach. Normally, the down-wind leg will not exceed one and a half minutes. The crosswind leg will be made as soon aspossible after the spotting device or jumper clears the aircraft. It is important that the target arearemains in sight at all times. 6.6.4.6.  Target is stationary.Pattern is aligned so that final course extends into the direction of the wind.6.6.4.7.  Fixed Target Pattern Procedures.AFI11-231   31 AUGUST 2005Figure 6.10.

Situation permitting, the aircrew will maintain visual or radio contact with the pararescueteam and maintain surveillance of the area for possible hazards. Every effort will be expended toensure that the pararescue team is covered by rescue aircraft until the party is assured of surfaceassistance. However, surface assistance for land operation is not required as long as sufficient sup-plies are available.

The airdrop of leaflets in support of psychological warfare operations (PSYOPS) requiresthe solution of wind drift and dispersion problems measured in nautical miles rather than yards. Thesesolutions are based on average leaflet characteristics and fundamental dead reckoning principles, compli-cated by the extremely long falling time from even relatively low drop altitudes. The following discussioncovers the procedures for computing the best track, altitude and release point for leaflet drops.7.2.  Mission Planning. Leaflet versus CARP Theory. Leaflets move horizontally with the air mass untilthey reach ground level, offering little or no air resistance. Each type of leaflet has a characteristic rate offall that can be used along with the ballistic wind vector to determine the release point for a given targetcenter. Unlike parachute supported loads, however, leaflets have no forward travel vector. They do havean additional ballistic, called the spread factor that determines the size of the leaflet pattern when it hitsthe ground. This factor, combined with the size of the target and the wind speed, determines the drop alti-tude for low altitude drops. The size and shape of the target, combined with the ballistic wind direction,determines the release track of the aircraft. Leaflet operations are far more affected by in-flight conditionsthan CARP aerial delivery, since the actual ballistic wind affects not only the release location, but theinbound track, and for low altitude drops, the release altitude. Because of this, an accurate weather fore-cast is the single most important requirement for a successful leaflet mission.7.2.1.  Rate of Fall (V). Leaflets are affected by up-drafts and down-drafts after their release, but over-all they will fall at fairly constant rate of a few feet per second. The actual rate of descent (V) varieswith altitude due to the change in air density, but for low altitude drops, the rate is essentially equal tothe constant sea level rate of fall (Vo). Average wind speed and rate of fall can be used to calculate thehorizontal drift distance for the leaflets from their release point until ground contact.7.2.2.  Spread Factor (RtTo). If the air was stable and all leaflets fell at exactly the same rate, theywould drift with the wind in a tightly packed group to land on one spot. Instead, there is a predictablevariation in the descent rates of the individual leaflets. For a given size and weight leaflet, the coeffi-cient of variation, called RtTo or spread factor, is the ratio of the range of descent times for 90% of theleaflets to the average descent time. The larger this value, for a given drift distance, the more the leaf-lets will spread apart. In addition, the leaflets will spread a small amount, even in still air. The spreadfactor is independent of the total number of leaflets in the release, so that releasing a larger number ofleaflets affects only the density of leaflets on the ground, and not the size of the ground pattern.7.2.3.  Target Coverage Planning:7.2.3.1.  Ground Pattern Size. The ground pattern from a single point release is elliptical in shapedue to the variation in descent rates (Figure 7.1.). Drift distance is measured along the ballisticwind direction to the center of the major axis, which is also parallel to the ballistic wind. In addi-tion to the spread from still air dispersion, this axis is lengthened by a factor equal to RtTo timesthe drift distance. At low altitude, the length of the minor axis (width of the ground pattern) is dueonly to still air dispersion and is approximately equal to one-half the drop altitude - about 0.5 nmfor a drop altitude of 6,000 feet. Because of the small size of the minor axis, a single point releasewill be adequate only for narrow targets such as lines of communication and coastlines.92AFI11-231   31 AUGUST 2005Figure 7.1.  Sequence of Events in a Leaflet release.7.2.3.2.  Multiple Release Planning. A continuous release hopper may be used if available, other-wise a series of bundles or delayed-opening packages may be dropped to cover the entire area. Thearea covered will always be a parallelogram, with two sides parallel to the ballistic wind directionand two parallel to the aircraft track, Figure 7.2. The mission planner must determine the opti-mum parallelogram to cover the target with a minimum of spillover. To determine the requiredground pattern, start by drawing two lines parallel to the average wind direction at each end of thetarget, Figure 7.3.A. These form the extreme pattern start and end points. Pick the track axis bydrawing two parallel lines to en-close the target area but as little of the outside area as possible,Figure 7.3.B. Finally, if excessive numbers of leaflets will be wasted in order to include a smallportion of the target area, the mission planner may elect to reduce the size of the selected parallel-ogram to optimize expended leaflets, Figure 7.3.C. The distance along the track axis (from pointA to B in Figure 7.3.C) is the target length, and is used to determine the number of releases. Thedistance along the wind axis (from point C to D) is the major axis length, and is used to determinethe drop altitude. AFI11-231   31 AUGUST 2005Figure 7.2.  Multiple Bundle Release.93Figure 7.3.  Determination of Major Axis and Target Length.7.2.4.  Low versus High Altitude Releases. High altitude leaflet drops permit a larger target area to becovered for a given number of leaflets. High level wind patterns, however, may place the release pointinside denied airspace or expose the aircraft and crew to threats. A low altitude release may also bepreferable if the target area is small, the number of leaflets is limited, or spillover into adjacent terri-tory must be avoided. In general, targets five miles in diameter or smaller are acceptable for low alti-tude drops.94AFI11-231   31 AUGUST 20057.3.  Low Altitude Release Procedures (Method 1).7.3.1.  Winds. For low altitude leaflet drops, the ballistic wind affects the inbound track and the releasealtitude, as well as the location of the release point. Also, in a threat area, a climb to check winds overthe target may not be possible. Mid-altitude winds can be checked en route or during the climb to dropaltitude. The computations shown below make it possible to update the release point using windsobtained in the climb, as long as the actual wind direction is fairly close to those used in preflight plan-ning. Changes in wind speed, but not direction, will affect the drop altitude more than the required off-set. These changes can be adjusted for after the climb to drop altitude has begun. Changes in the winddirection, on the other hand, are practically impossible to readjust close to the target area. This isbecause both the track axis and the required major axis length are changed, affecting the drop altitudeand the offset distance. For these reasons, an accurate preflight wind is extremely important. Afterobtaining preflight winds, consider the effect of any terrain in the target area and up to five to ten milesupwind of the target.7.3.2.  Wind Averaging (Figure 7.4.). Obtain forecast winds at the surface and at each 1,000 footincrement up to 4,000 feet above target elevation. Using the DR computer wind face or graph paper,determine the net wind direction and velocity from the surface to each 1,000 foot altitude up to 4,000feet.Figure 7.4.

The netwind velocities from the averaging example above are used in the following example. While winddirection is not used directly in the calculations, the net wind direction at 4,000 feet (107 degrees) isused to determine the required major axis length, Figure 7.2. and Figure 7.3.7.3.3.1.  Enter the preflight data for the example shown below on AF Form 4011, Figure 7.5.Major axis of target  (along net wind dir.):  3.0 nmLength of target (along desired track):  4.0 nmLeaflet type:  8.5" X 3.2" / 20# paper7.3.3.2.  If the paper weight is unknown, follow the instructions in the NOTE at the end of Figure7.6. With the leaflet size and paper weight, enter the reverse side of AF Form 4011, Figure 7.6., tofind the spread factor (RtTo) and ground rate of fall (Vo) (0.43 and 1.7 ft/sec in the example).Enter these values in block 11, and enter the spread factor in the "1 nm drift distance" block on thegraph as well. This value corresponds to 1 nm of drift distance. Mark the horizontal scale with atick mark at the value of RtTo. Use dividers (or multiply RtTo by 2, 3, 4, ...) to mark tick marks atequal intervals along the rest of the horizontal scale. Label mark in intervals of 1 nm drift distance,Figure 7.5.7.3.3.3.  Calculate (RtTo)/Vo and enter the result in the "1 knot Wind Velocity" block on the graph(0.253 in the example). This value corresponds to 1 knot of wind velocity. As with the drift dis-tance, mark the vertical scale in intervals of 1 knot. Label the marks in intervals of 1 or 5 knots, asdesired.NOTE: Steps (1) and (2) above need not be repeated for each mission if the leaflet size and weightremains unchanged. The graph with marked and labeled scales may be reproduced and reused.7.3.3.4.  Mark the forecast surface wind on the vertical wind scale. Using the preflight net windvelocities calculated in paragraph (2) above, plot each net wind on each slanted altitude line, Fig-ure 7.5. If necessary, obtain wind forecasts for higher altitudes and calculate additional net windsto extend the wind line as close as possible to the right side of the chart.7.3.3.5.  Mark a point (P on Figure 7.5.) at the intersection of the wind line and the curved verticalline corresponding to the required major axis, interpolating as necessary. Project from point P ver-tically down to find the required offset distance upwind from the target track axis (6.4 nm in theexample). Interpolate point P between the slanted altitude lines to find the required drop altitude(3000 feet in the example).

Figure 7.7. to Figure 7.12. contain 19 descent rates (V0) that apply to many leaflets of varioussizes and paper weights. Once the descent rate has been determined for a given leaflet, the drift dis-tance to the center of the leaflet pattern or mass can be determined. For example, when dropping at3000 feet the (V0) for the 6”x3” leaflet (20 lb) is 2.5' per second (see Figure 7.6.). For a 10 knot wind,reading across figure Figure 7.7. to the 2.5 feet per second column, we find the total drift to the centerof impact is 3.8 nm.7.4.2.  The length of the leaflet pattern or major axis can also be determined by multiplying the spreadfactor (RTOT0) found on the reverse side of AF Form 4011 (Figure 7.6.) by the total drift distance.For example, as determined above, center of mass for the 6”x3” leaflet in 20 lb. paper weight drifted3.8nm in a 10 knot wind. To find the major axis of the leaflet pattern, multiply the spread factor(RTT0) of 1.11 times the drift distance of 3.8 nm and the answer is 4.2 nm. To this add 1/2 of therelease altitude which is 1500' or .25nm for a total major axis of 4.45 nm. The minor axis is then com-puted at 1/2 the release altitude. In this example the minor axis is .25 nm.7.4.3.  If a last minute decision is made to fly at a lower altitude due to high winds or low hangingclouds, an adjustment can be made to account for the change. Using the above example, if the drop ismade from 2,000 feet, the drift distance is then 2/3rds of the answer shown or if from 500 feet, 1/6thof the answer shown.7.4.4.  The distance of ground elevation above sea level must also be taken into consideration. Thedata in figures Figure 7.7. to Figure 7.12. are from the specified altitude to sea level.

High Altitude Release Procedures. High altitude leaflet releases present unique problems to themission planner, since even a moderate change in wind direction or speed can cause the leaflet releasetrack to be displaced several miles. Depending on the characteristics of the leaflet, the average descenttime from 25,000 feet can be over five hours. Wind information, therefore, must take into account changesexpected in the lower altitude winds several hours after the planned release time. Missions may be tar-geted for well defined urban/border areas, or for large expanses of sparsely populated rural territory. Cov-erage of the required area is so dependent on the falling characteristics of the leaflet that the selection ofAFI11-231   31 AUGUST 2005107size and paper weight should be confirmed only after study of the required flight profile, wind patterns,and required target coverage has been made.7.5.1.  Instructions for completing AF Form 4016, High Altitude Leaflet Computations (Figure7.13.):7.5.1.1.  Enter the table on the back side of AF Form 4016 (Figure 7.6.) with the leaflet size andpaper weight to find Vo and RtTo. Also note whether the leaflet is an autorotator or non-autorota-tor. Enter the results at the top of Section I of AF Form 4016.7.5.1.2.  Obtain forecast winds in 5,000 foot intervals up to the highest anticipated drop altitude.Enter in the wind speed and direction columns of the AF Form 4016, Section I.7.5.1.3.  .Enter the table on the back side of AF Form 4016 (Figure 7.14.) with the leaflet type(autorotator/non-autorotator) and ground rate of descent (Vo). Find the time factor in hours foreach 5,000 foot altitude block and enter in Section I. If the average target elevation is above 1000feet MSL, multiply the time factor for the 0-5,000 foot block by the factor (5,000 - Target Elev)/5,000.7.5.1.4.  For each 5,000 foot block, calculate the drift distance and enter in Section I. Starting withthe lowest altitude block, plot the drift vectors (drift distance and wind direction) end to end on anappropriately scaled chart (1:1,000,000 scale or larger). Each vector is plotted into the wind direc-tion, and the first vector originates from the center of the target area, Figure 7.13.7.5.1.5.  .Measure the distance and azimuth from the end of each vector to the target center andenter in Section II. Calculate the length of the major axis for each 5,000 foot drop altitude incre-ment on Section II as shown in Figure 7.13.7.5.1.6.  On the chart, compare the required target area with the major axis length for each 5,000foot block to determine the required drop altitude. Note that the major axis is to be measured alongthe Measured Net Wind Direction for that drop altitude. Enter the selected drop altitude in SectionIII. If at maximum drop altitude the major axis is still too small, either:7.5.1.6.1.  Select a new leaflet size or weight with a larger coefficient of variation or slowerrate of fall.7.5.1.6.2.  Reduce the required major axis by making two or more passes, Figure 7.16.7.5.1.6.3.  Postpone the mission until stronger winds are forecast.7.5.1.6.4.  Use a different drop platform with a higher altitude capability.7.5.1.7.  Determine the desired release track(s). The release track start and end points (A and B inFigure 7.16.) are located at the drift distance (52.2 nm in Figure 7.13.) upwind along the drop alti-tude net wind direction from points a and b.108AFI11-231   31 AUGUST 2005Figure 7.13.

Use Section III of AF Form 4016 to calculate the minor axis as follows:110AFI11-231   31 AUGUST 20057.5.1.8.1.  Divide the selected drop altitude by 12,152 to obtain the no-wind minor axis in nm(2.1 in Figure 7.13.).7.5.1.8.2.  To adjust for minor axis spread caused by changing wind direction between surfaceand drop altitude, measure the maximum lateral distance the wind vectors deviate from the net(drop altitude) drift vector (1.8 nm in Figure 7.15.).7.5.1.8.3.  Add the spread factor (Rt/To) to the sum of (a) and (b) to obtain the minor axis.7.5.1.8.4.  Use the bottom section of AF Form 4016, High Altitude Leaflet Computations, tocalculate and record the items in the Drop Information Summary for use in the mission andin-flight briefings.AFI11-231   31 AUGUST 2005Figure 7.15.  Drift Vector Plot.111Figure 7.16.  Using Multiple Passes to Expand Major Axis.7.6.  Accuracy Limitations. The accuracy of the low altitude and high altitude leaflet computation meth-ods are only as good as the wind data upon which they so heavily depend. If complete coverage of adefined area is more critical than avoiding spillover, points A and B, in Figure 7.16., can be defined far-ther apart to account for possible wind direction variation. The required major axis length can also beexpanded by 10% to allow for variation in wind speed. In addition to wind variations, other factors canprevent the target audience from receiving the desired density of leaflets. Mountains will create a112AFI11-231   31 AUGUST 2005"shadow" effect downwind, as leaflets land on their upwind side. High humidity during printing and pro-cessing may cause leaflets to stick together or even freeze at high altitudes, causing them to fall nearlystraight down. The average rate of fall may vary significantly from the values shown in Table 1 for vari-ous reasons. To allow for these variations, select leaflets with a relatively high spread factor so the proba-bility of covering the target area will improve. Normally, the use of leaflets with spread factors less than0.20 should be avoided. AFI11-231   31 AUGUST 2005113Chapter 8  C-141/C-17/C-5 AERIAL DELIVERY DATA8.1.

C-130 Aerial Delivery Airspeeds. Aerial delivery airspeeds are a function of the force required toinflate the parachute and the airdrop altitude to minimize damage to the airdropped object. For AFSOConly, when the mission requires use of airspeeds other than those recommended, ensure airspeed fallswithin the parachute airspeed range listed in Chapter 10. All crewmembers will be briefed on the dropairspeed.Table 9.1.  C-130 Aerial Delivery Airspeeds.

For combination drops, use the higher airspeedKIAS. 9.2.  C-130 Aerial Delivery Altitudes. The altitudes listed in Table 9.2. are the minimum altitudes abovethe highest point on the drop zone. Commanders may agree to higher altitudes. For formation drops, noaircraft will drop at a lower altitude than a preceding aircraft in the formation. When load compatibility oroperational considerations permit, stack elements beginning with the lowest drop altitude. No aircraft willdrop lower than its computed drop altitude. For combination drops, the load requiring the highest dropaltitude determines the aircraft drop altitude. Airdrops at or above 3,000 feet AGL will be conducted withhigh altitude parachutes, either high velocity ring slot or high altitude high/low opening (HAHO/HALO).Minimum altitudes shown are intended to provide guidance and do not restrict the Army and Air Forcecommanders in their planning of combat operations. Altitudes are based on the technical design character-istics of the parachutes and represent the minimum at which the parachutes may be expected to performtheir intended function with acceptable reliability. Use of lower altitudes than shown may result in theAFI11-231   31 AUGUST 2005129parachute(s) failing to achieve their design performance and introduce safety hazards to jump personnelor result in unacceptable damage to loads.Table 9.2.

NOTES:1.If the following criteria are not met, the minimum altitude is 1,000 feet AGL: (1) Static lines are used. (2) Para-chutes are equipped with anti-inversion devices. (3) When using T-10 parachutes, use established exit control pro-cedures. (4) When using MC1-1A/B/C parachutes, use alternating door exit procedures (ADEPT). ADEPT doesnot apply to combat operations or special tactics personnel. 2.

Aerial Delivery Wind Limitations. Aerial delivery wind limits and restrictions will be based on theinformation contained in Table 9.3. and Table 9.4. When surface winds are known, airdrop decisions willbe based solely on surface wind limitations. When surface winds are unknown (e.g., blind drops tounmanned DZs), the jumpmaster and army airborne mission commander (if designated) will be advisedwhen drop altitude winds exceed 30 knots for personnel drops. For blind equipment and bundle aerialdeliveries to unmanned DZs, the aircraft commander will make the decision to drop. For operational res-cue missions, the decision to deploy the jumpers is determined by the jumpmaster and aircraft com-mander.AFI11-231   31 AUGUST 2005131Table 9.3.

Aerial Delivery Parachute Ballistics. The ballistics of different types of parachutes vary. Eachparachute is designed for a specific purpose and has its own peculiar characteristics. The data representsaverage information derived from aerial delivery test run by the US Army Airborne board, US Army Nat-ick Laboratory, and the US Air force Mobility Center (USAFMOBCENT). Where exact data is notdepicted, interpolate between given values. In all cases: Load Weight = Suspended Weight + ParachuteWeight. Aircrews will not make airdrops using parachutes for which this instruction does not list ballisticsunless the user provides approved ballistic data or "K" factor. The ballistics or "K" factor must beapproved by the above mentioned agencies or the MAJCOM. This does not apply to formal tests132AFI11-231   31 AUGUST 2005Table 9.5.
