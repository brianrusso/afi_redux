Training  Objective.  This  instruction  prescribes  basic  policy  and  guidance  for  training United  States  Air  Force  Operational  Support  Airlift/Executive  Airlift  (OSA/EA)  crewmembers according to AFI 11-202, Volume 1, Aircrew Training. 1.1.1.  The overall objective of the training program is to develop and maintain a high state of mission  readiness  for  immediate  and  effective  employment  in  exercises,  peacekeeping operations, contingencies, and war;  and to  provide safe,  comfortable, and reliable air travel for national and world leaders. 1.1.2.  The  secondary  objective  is  to  standardize  Regular  Air  Force  (RegAF),  Air  Force Reserve Command and Air National Guard training requirements into a single document to in  AFI  11-200,  Aircrew  Training, meet Standardization/Evaluation, and General Operations Structure. for  a  basic  document requirements 1.1.3.  This publication refers to training requirements controlled by other AFIs and provides guidance derived from those AFIs.  The controlling AFI may be updated after the publication of this volume, so it is necessary to refer to the source document AFI for current guidance. If a  conflict  is  identified  for  an  ancillary  training  requirement,  comply  with  the  source document that establishes the training requirement. 1.1.4.  The authorities to waive wing/unit level requirements in this publication are identified with a Tier (“T-0, T-1, T-2, T-3”) number following the compliance statement.  See AFI 33-360,  Publications  and  Forms  Management,  for  a  description  of  the  authorities  associated with  the  Tier  numbers.  Submit  requests  for  waivers  through  the  chain  of  command  to  the appropriate  Tier  waiver  approval  authority,  or  alternately,  to  the  Publication  OPR  for  non-tiered compliance items.  Additional guidance can be found in paragraph 1.5. 1.2.  Key Words Explained. 1.2.1.  Will” and “shall” indicate a mandatory requirement. 1.2.2.  “Should”  is  normally  used  to  indicate  a  preferred,  but  not  mandatory,  method  of accomplishment. 1.2.3.  “May” indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment. 1.2.4.  “Note” indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., which are considered essential to emphasize. 1.3.  Responsibilities.  AFI 11-202 Volume 1 outlines responsibilities for aircrew training. 1.3.1.  Lead  Command.  Air  Mobility  Command  (AMC)  is  designated  lead  command  for OSA/EA  aircraft  according  to  AFPD  10-9,  Lead  Operating  Command  Weapon  System Management,  AFPD  11-2,  Aircraft  Rules  and  Procedures,  and  AFPD  10-21,  Air  Mobility Lead  Command  Roles  and  Responsibilities.    The  lead  command  is  responsible  for establishing and standardizing aircrew flying training requirements in coordination with user commands.  AMC/A3  delegates  AMC/A3T  the  authority  to  manage  all  training  course requirements, training tasks, and Aircrew Training System (ATS) in Chapter 6. AMC/A3TA 8 AFI11-2EAV1  21 APRIL 2017 is the OPR for this AFI. The Air National Guard is considered a MAJCOM for purposes of this instruction. 1.3.1.1.  Courses.  AMC/A3T,  in  coordination  with  other  MAJCOMs,  approves/fields initial  qualification,  mission  certification,  continuation  training,  and  locally  taught upgrade courses. 1.3.1.2.  Realistic  Training  Review  Board  (RTRB).  AMC/A3T  will  host  a  RTRB biennially, or more frequently  as required. The RTRB reviews all training programs for currency, applicability, compliance, and effectiveness. Attendees should include training representatives from the OSA/EA community including:   AMC/A3T/A3V/A3D, USAF Expeditionary  Center,  AETC,  AFRC,  ANG,  PACAF,  USAFE,  NAF,  standardization offices, and selected unit training representatives as applicable. 1.3.2.  Training Command. 1.3.2.1.  AMC/A3T  is  responsible  for  commercially  contracted  school  syllabi  and  is  the approval  authority  for  any  formal  school  curricula  changes  in  coordination  with  user commands according to AFI 11-202V1.  AMC oversees commercially contracted courses and  syllabus  management  in  coordination  with  the  contractor.  AMC/A3T  develops  and publishes  the  Programmed  Flying  Training  (PFT)  IAW  the  AF/A3XI  Flying  Training CONOPS.  AMC  determines  formal  school  requirements  in  coordination  with  user commands. 1.3.2.2.  For EA, the term ‘formal school’ refers to formalized aircrew training conducted outside  the  unit,  either  at  a  commercially  contracted  facility  or  at  an  FTU,  and  not intended  to  be  completed  in-unit  (i.e.  C-40  pilot  initial  qualification,  Flight  Attendant BFA, etc.). This does not include routine continuation or refresher training. 1.3.3.  User Commands. 1.3.3.1.  Student  Management.    MAJCOM  training  staff  will  manage  student  training requirements  according  to  the  individual  training  contract  requirements  and  paragraph 1.14. 1.3.3.2.  Recall Procedures. Formal requests to recall students from a formal school will be sent from the student's SQ/CC to OG/CC, to MAJCOM A3TA (or equivalent) and the MAJCOM Contracting Officer for approval and coordination with the training contractor. Emergency  recall  during  non-duty  hours  may  be  coordinated  directly  with  applicable training  contractor,  with  follow  up  coordination  with  AMC/A3TA  and  MAJCOM Contracting Officer on the next duty day. 1.3.4.  Wing Commander.  WG/CC will ensure unit/local level agencies and facilities support aircrew  ground  training  programs.    Host  and/or  co-located  units  will  develop  local agreements to consolidate aircrew training support base-wide. 1.3.5.  Operations/Airlift Group. 1.3.5.1.  The OG/CC (or equivalent) will convene a Training Review Panel (TRP) to be chaired  by  the  OG/CC  or  a  designated  representative.  Panel  members  should  include representatives  from  squadron  training,  tactics,  operations,  safety  and  other  areas  as determined by the commander [e.g. Host Aviation Resource Management (HARM) and AFI11-2EAV1  21 APRIL 2017 9 Squadron Resource Management (SARM)].   PAG/CC is the OG/CC equivalent for this instruction. 1.3.5.1.1.  TRP  Requirements.  As  a  minimum,  the  OG/CC  will  convene  the  TRP semi-annually  and  maintain  minutes  for  a  period  of  two  years.  Squadrons  and detachments  not  collocated  with  their  OG  may  conduct  their  own  panel  or  provide representation to the OG TRP. Panel minutes from non-collocated squadron TRP will be forwarded to the OG for inclusion in the OG TRP. 1.3.5.1.2.  TRP Format.  The TRP should review staff and crewmember management actions  necessary  to  complete  squadron  flight  and  ground  training  programs.  Suggested  TRP  topics  include,  but  are  not  limited  to:  current  and  forecast  Flight Training Levels (FTL), upgrade and Continuation Training (CT) status, semi-annual requirement completion rates, crew position gains/losses, Aircraft Commander (AC), Instructor and Evaluator upgrades. OG/CC’s will review all “X” events for relevancy to  the  unit’s  mission  during  the  TRP.  This  review  will  be  documented  in  the  TRP minutes. 1.3.5.2.  OG/CC will develop and maintain procedures with their local servicing Military Personnel  Flight  (MPF)  for  individual  crewmember  counseling  and  personnel  system updates  affecting  an  Active  Duty  Service  Commitment  (ADSC)  incurred  from  training described  in  this  AFI.  See  AFI  11-202V1,  AFI  36-2107,  Active  Duty  Service Commitments (ADSC), and course listing in ETCA for more information. 1.3.5.3.  OG/CC  may  develop  additional  training  requirements  and/or  programs  as necessary  to  meet  unit  mission  requirements.  Units  may  include  such  requirements  in  a local supplement to this AFI. 1.3.5.4.  The operations group, in coordination with the flying squadrons and presidential unit, will determine the functions and responsibilities of the operations support squadron (OSS)  training  flight,  where  established.    Any  operations  group  training  functions stipulated  in  this  instruction  may  also  be  performed  by  appropriate  OSS  training  flight personnel. 1.3.5.5.  OG/CC  is  responsible  for  establishing  and  maintaining  the  academic  training program  for  non-ATS  courses  (may  be  delegated  to  squadron  level).  The  OG  (or squadron) OPR will: 1.3.5.5.1.  Appoint  primary  and  alternate  instructors  for  each  non-ATS  course  to  be taught. 1.3.5.5.2.  Publish  a  ground  training  schedule  (ANG/AFRC,  as  required)  to  include date,  time,  location,  instructor  and  designated  crewmembers  for  each  course  (both ATS and non-ATS). Units may include such details in a local supplement to this AFI. 1.3.5.5.3.  Use  MAJCOM,  ATS,  or  unit  developed  training  products  and/or  syllabus for all courses, as applicable. 1.3.5.5.4.  Develop a procedure to monitor the academic training program for course content,  currency  of  materials,  instructor  availability,  and  status  of  training  aids. Squadrons  recommend  to  the  commander  changes  to  existing  courses  or  additional academic training courses required, based on crewmember feedback. 10 AFI11-2EAV1  21 APRIL 2017 1.3.5.6.  Instructor Selection and Training. OG/CC will select course instructors for non-ATS  courses  on  the  basis  of  professional  qualifications  and  aptitude  to  teach.  Local academic  instructor  program  will  follow  guidance  in  AFMAN  36-2236,  Guidebook  for Air  Force  Instructors.  An  individual  who  instructs  a  class  receives  credit  for  that academic training requirement. 1.3.5.7.  Send recommendations for changes, additions, and deletions of courses through appropriate  channels  to  appropriate  MAJCOM  with  an  information  copy  to  HQ AMC/A3T. 1.3.6.  Squadron. SQ/CC (or designated representative) will: 1.3.6.1.  Select  DOT Chiefs from the most highly qualified and experienced instructors. Previous  Evaluator  or  FTU  experience  is  highly  desired.  ARC  units  with  a  single squadron may use the OST Chief for this purpose. 1.3.6.2.  Squadron  DOT  should  be  manned  with  a  minimum  of  one  instructor  in  each crew position. Instructors should be selected based on experience, availability, and time on station to ensure continuity of operations. ARC units with a single squadron may use the OST Chief for this purpose. 1.3.6.3.  Convene a Squadron Training Review Panel (STRP) to be chaired by the SQ/CC and/or  SQ/DO.    Panel  members  should  include  representatives  from  squadron  training, squadron  stan/eval,  ADOs  and  instructors.    SQ/CCs  should  utilize  the  STRP  to  focus training objectives, ensure standards are being met, select upgrade candidates, and ensure completion of required continuation training. 1.3.6.3.1.  STRP  Requirements.    Squadrons  will  convene  a  STRP  at  least  quarterly and maintain minutes for a period of two  years.  STRP minutes will be approved by the SQ/CC and may be produced/distributed/stored electronically by the SQ/DOT. 1.3.6.3.2.  STRP  Format.  The  STRP  should  review  staff  and  crewmember management  actions  necessary  to  complete  squadron  flight  and  ground  training programs. The STRP will review the current status of aircrew training to ensure that current  training  objectives  are  being  met  and  that  those  individuals  selected  for upgrade training are the best candidates after reviewing their experience, proficiency level, and retainability. To accomplish these goals, suggested STRP topics include but are not limited to: crew position gains/losses, current upgrade/requalification training (i.e. crewmembers in an active training status), recently completed training (including performance  during  training  and  current  certification  status),  future  training (individuals  already  approved  via  STRP),  upgrade  candidates,  current  waivers, projected waivers, and continuation training status. 1.3.6.4.  Ensure crewmembers complete training in accordance with Table 1.2.  Training Time Limitations. Failure to reasonably progress may require action for removal. 1.3.6.5.  Assign  Flying  Training  Levels  (FTL),  and  levels  of  qualification  (evaluator, instructor,  etc.)  to  assigned  and  attached  crewmembers  before  each  semiannual  training period. Base TL assignments on experience and aircraft proficiency.  Use the date of the initial  qualification  in-  flight  evaluation  for  determining  an  individual’s  time  in  the Mission Design Series (MDS). AFI11-2EAV1  21 APRIL 2017 11 1.3.6.6.  Ensure  effective  training  continuity  and  supervision  of  assigned  and  attached crewmembers.  Unit commander may assign additional requirements based on individual crewmember’s experience and proficiency. 1.3.6.7.  Review  training  and  evaluation  records  of  newly  assigned  crewmembers  and those  completing  formal  training,  to  determine  the  necessary  training  required  to complete/certify  the  individual  as  Basic  Aircraft  Qualified  (BAQ),  Basic  Mission Capable (BMC), or Mission Ready (MR). 1.3.6.8.  Approve squadron-level aircrew certifications described in this instruction. 1.3.6.9.  Progress  Review  Board  (PRB).    If  at  any  time  during  a  trainee’s  flight instruction,  progress  is  considered  unsatisfactory,  the  responsible  unit  will  convene  a PRB to review the trainee’s record and determine whether to continue, modify, terminate training,  or  conduct  a  Flight  Evaluation  Board  or  Aircrew  Evaluation  Board.  For  ATS instruction, see Chapter 6. 1.3.6.10.  Coordinate with the group training function in developing training programs. 1.3.6.11.  Review  qualifications  and  monitor  training  requirements  for  Flight  Surgeons (FS). 1.3.6.12.  Ensure  DOT  or  DOT  designated  representatives  monitor  quality  of  training, document waivers, identify training deficiencies, and advise SQ/CC of additional training needs.  Ensure,  to  the  maximum  extent  possible,  that  flight  training  sorties  (including those conducted when all Vol 1 training requirements for all crew positions have already been met) are required to meet aircrew, unit, or external user requirements. 1.3.7.  Formal School with Aircrew Training System (ATS) Contractor. ATS contractors are responsible  for  academic  and  aircrew  training  device  (ATD)  instruction  at  the  ATS  sites. This responsibility includes developing, updating and publishing courseware and the formal school  syllabus  in  accordance  with  the  ATS  contract.  AFI  11-202V1  contains  additional guidance. 1.4.  Waiver Authority. 1.4.1.  Do  not  deviate  from  the  policies  and  requirements  in  this  instruction.  Report deviations or exceptions without waiver through channels to MAJCOM/A3T (or equivalent) who, in turn, should notify AMC/A3T for follow-on action, if necessary. 1.4.2.  Unless specified in this instruction, MAJCOM/A3T is the designated waiver authority for specific aircrew training requirements in this instruction that are not governed by AFI 11-202 Volume 1 or other AFIs. (T-2) OG/CCs are designated as the waiver authority for semi-annual  requirements  mandated  in  Chapter  4  of  this  AFI.  (T-3)  Waivers  for  semi-annual requirements missed in consecutive periods will require MAJCOM/A3T approval. (T-2) 1.4.3.  The  OG/CC  is  designated  waiver  authority  for  minimum  flying  hour  and  time requirements for entry into formal upgrade courses (see Table 5.1). (T-3) 1.4.3.1.  The 201 AS/CC will submit waiver requests to this volume through NGB/A3M. The  932  OG/CC  will  submit  waiver  requests  to  this  volume  through  AFRC/A3M. NGB/A3M and AFRC/A3M will send information copies to AMC/A3TA. A copy of the 12 AFI11-2EAV1  21 APRIL 2017 MAJCOM  approved  waiver  will  be  placed  in  the  individual’s  training  folder  and  a squadron training waiver log. 1.4.4.  Senior Officer Course (SOC). See formal course syllabus and AFI 11-202V1. Waiver authority for specific SOC syllabus events is AMC/A3T.  (T-2) 1.4.5.  Continuation Training Waiver. The OG/CC is designated waiver authority for training requirements  in  Chapter  4  for  assigned  or  attached  crewmembers  on  a  case-by-case  basis (see  paragraph    4.9).  (T-3)    Waivers  for  training  events  missed  in  consecutive  training periods will require MAJCOM/A3T approval. (T-2) 1.4.6.  In-Unit Training Waiver. MAJCOM/A3T (or equivalent) is approval/waiver authority for in-unit training via secondary method in coordination with AMC/A3T. Before requesting a waiver, review the appropriate syllabus or training guide and consider availability of formal instruction and ATD requirements. In the text of the waiver request, identify the shortfall of formal training availability and the operational impact if an in-unit waiver is not approved. 1.4.7.  Waiver  Format.    Waivers  for  training  events  missed  in  consecutive  training  periods will  require  MAJCOM/A3T  approval.  (T-2)  For  AMC  waivers,  use  on-line  waiver  request service on Graduate Training Integration Management System (GTIMS), or ANG procedures as  appropriate.  For  AFRC  waivers,  staff  AF  IMT  1786  to  AFRC/A3M  via  email  to HQAFRC.A3M.Workflow@us.af.mil.

Use of Training Flying Hours. 1.5.1.  Structure  unit  flying  training  missions  to  achieve  optimum  training.  Any  by-product airlift  opportunity  resulting  from  training  must  not  degrade  the  intended  training  and  will comply  with  applicable  Department  of  Defense  (DoD)  Regulation  4515.13-R,  Air Transportation Eligibility, AFI 11-401, Aviation Management and AFI 11-202, Volume 1. 14 AFI11-2EAV1  21 APRIL 2017 1.5.1.1.  It  is  essential  that  all  personnel  at  all  levels  prevent  the  misuse  of  air  mobility resources as well as the perception of their misuse when planning and executing local or off-station training missions. 1.5.1.2.  The approval authority for an off-station training flight is the WG/CC and may not  be  delegated  lower  than  OG/CC.    (T-3)    Coordinate  with  appropriate  scheduling agency  (HQ  USAF/Assistant  Vice  Chief  of  Staff/Special  Air  Missions  (CVAM),  ANG, 618th  Air  Operations  Center  (618  AOC),  Joint  Operational  Support  Airlift  Center (JOSAC),  Air  Mobility  Operations  Control  Centers  (AMOCC),  or  theater  equivalent whichever  is  appropriate.  Forward  a  copy  of  the  planned  itinerary  to  the  appropriate agency  (18  AF/CCE  or  MAJCOM/DOT/A3T).  NOTE:  The  approval  authority  for  201 AS  off-station  OCONUS  training  flights  is  113  WG/CC.    The  approval  authority  for CONUS training flights is 113 OG/CC. 1.5.1.3.  By  virtue  of  signature  on  the  Flight  Authorization,  unit  commanders  (or  their designated representatives) are verifying that training sorties (including those conducted when  all  Vol  1  training  requirements  for  all  crew  positions  have  already  been  met)  are required to meet aircrew, unit, or external user requirements. 1.5.2.  Training on Operational Missions.  Aircraft Commander will depart home station with a  list  of  required  currency  events.    All  crew  members  will  take  full  advantage  of opportunities  to  accomplish  required  currency  events  on  operational  missions.  Unless specifically  prohibited  or  restricted  by  MDS  operating  procedures  or  specific  theater operations  order  (OPORD),  upgrade,  qualification  or  special  qualification  training  may  be accomplished on operational missions. Commanders will ensure the training will not impact mission effectiveness and the crewmember receiving training is under the supervision of an instructor  of  like  specialty.  See  passenger-  carrying  restrictions  in  AFI  11-401.  NOTE: Unqualified  pilots  are  not  allowed  access  to  the  controls  with  passengers  on  board  the aircraft. 1.5.3.  Unit  Commanders  will  utilize  available  aircrew  training  devices  (Operational  Flight Trainer,  Boom  Operator  Weapons  Systems  Trainer,  etc.)  for  continuation  training  to  the maximum extent possible. 1.6.  In-Unit  Training  Time  Limitations.  Comply  with  the  time  limitations  in  Table  1.2. Crewmembers entered in an in-unit training program leading to qualification, requalification or certification will be dedicated to that program on a full-time basis. 1.6.1.  Training time starts with one of the following events: 1.6.1.1.  The  first  significant  training  event,  i.e.  a  training  event  directly  contributing  to qualification,  certification,  or  upgrade:  e.g.  Computer-based  training  (CBT),  ground, classroom,  simulator,  flight,  or  Mission  Communications  System/Mission  Data  System (MCS/MDS)  training.    NOTE:    This  does  not  include  squadron/mission  orientation events, or contracted pilot/flight engineer initial or requalification training. 1.6.1.2.  Or  45  calendar  days  (90  days  ANG/AFRC)  following  a  member’s  reporting  to the unit following completion of a formal school, whichever occurs first (or as specified in MAJCOM supplement). 1.6.2.  Training time ends with one of the following events: AFI11-2EAV1  21 APRIL 2017 15 1.6.2.1.  The flight  evaluation (if required). Crewmembers should begin  their evaluation within 30 days after being recommended. 1.6.2.2.  Or  instructor  validation  of  successful  certification  program  completion  (i.e. Differences, SAP, etc.). 1.6.2.3.  Sq/CC  may  extend  training  time  up  to  60-days  (120-days  ARC)  through  a Memorandum For Record (MFR) or waiver website documentation in training folder; no notification to MAJCOM/A3T (or equivalent) is required. Extensions exceeding 60-days (120  days  ARC)  require  MAJCOM/A3T  (or  equivalent)  approval  (AMC  AD  use AMC/A3T  waiver  website)  and  will  be  requested  before  the  crewmember  exceeds upgrade training time limits in Table 1.2.  (T-2) 1.6.3.  For  extended  delays  awaiting  evaluation,  Sq/CCs  or  DOs  may  authorize  additional training  events  (flights/ground  training)  to  maintain  proficiency.    These  additional  events must be documented in the Form 4022 or web-based training record. Table 1.2.  In-Unit Training Time Limitations.

If required, CSO mission qualification training will begin after completion of all Information Technology course requirements.   2.  Mission qualification for VC-25 is 360 days. 3.  May run concurrently with mission qualification training 1.7.  Training Documentation.  Units will use the AF Form 4324, Aircraft Assignment/Aircrew Qualification  Worksheet  to  update  aircrew  certifications  in  Aviation  Recsource  Management System  (ARMS).  Block  22  will  be  used  to  document  award  of  specific  ARMS  “Q”  code identifiers  and  contain  the  following  minimum  information:  “Q”  code  (i.e.,  QXXX), Certification  Name,  and  date  of  certification.  See  Chapter  7  for  specific  “Q”  codes.    See Attachment 2 for additional training documentation requirements. 1.8.  Flight  Examiner  Usage  .  Use flight evaluators for any phase of training to capitalize on their  expertise  and  experience.  Units  may  use  flight  evaluators  as  instructors  for  qualification, local upgrade, or corrective-action training. If an evaluator is used as a primary instructor to train an individual, the same evaluator should not administer the associated evaluation. 1.9.  Instructor Training and Supervision Requirements. 1.9.1.  All instructors should be MR (wing-level and below). Instructors must be current and qualified in any event that they instruct. 1.9.2.  When  performing  crewmember  duties,  the  following  personnel  will  be  under  direct supervision of an instructor of like specialty: 1.9.2.1.  All non-current crewmembers (see paragraph 4.2.5 for exceptions). 1.9.2.2.  All  crewmembers  in  initial,  upgrade  (to  include  special  mission  qualification training) or requalification flying training unless Syllabus or Training Guide states direct supervision is not required. 1.9.2.3.  All crewmembers performing restricted flying events listed on the AF Form 8 as prescribed  by  AFI  11-202,  Volume  2,  Aircrew  Standardization/Evaluation  Program Organization and Administration. 1.9.2.4.  For unqualified, non-current, and FTL E crewmembers, an instructor will be at a set of controls or providing supervision during critical phases of flight. 1.9.2.5.  Any other personnel designated by the wing, OG, or SQ/CC. 1.10.  Distribution  . Units will establish distribution requirements of this AFI. 1.11.  Transfer  of  Aircrews  .    When  a  crewmember  transfers  from  one  unit  to  another,  the gaining  unit  will  review,  assess  and  assign  the  appropriate  FTL.  Certified/qualified  MR crewmember will only accomplish unit specific training and any applicable events in which they AFI11-2EAV1  21 APRIL 2017 17 have  lost  currency.  See  Chapter  3  for  additional  information  in  regards  to  transfer  of  aircrew members. 1.12.  Aircrew Training While DNIF and Alert. 1.12.1.  Crewmembers  whose  status  is  "duty  not  involving  flying  (DNIF)"  may  complete ground  training  events,  including  simulator  training,  if  the  member's  physical  condition allows  it.  Consult  the  flight  surgeon  initiating  DD  Form  2992  (prescribed  by  AFI  48-123, Medical  Examinations  and  Standards)  if  the  DNIF  status  includes  ground  training limitations. 1.12.2.  Crewmembers  may  complete  ground  training  while  on  alert  status  if  it  does  not interfere with rest cycles or alert responsiveness. 1.13.  Aircrew Rated Management Overview. 1.13.1.  Programmed Flying Training (PFT). AMC/A3T fulfills the training command’s role IAW AFI 11-202V1. A key product of this process is the PFT. The PFT balances available training quotas, ATS throughput, schoolhouse capacities and course requirements on a Fiscal Year  basis.  Annually,  units  will  send  projected  PFT  requirements  to  their  respective MAJCOM  quota  managers,  who  in  turn  compile  and  forward  projections  to  AF/A3XI,  for inclusion into the Graduate Program Requirements Document (GPRD). Training commands will determine training capacity and report shortfall in the GPRD to AF/A3XI. 1.13.1.1.  AF/A3XI sponsors an annual PFT conference for attendees to balance training capacity,  MAJCOM  training  requests,  and  pipeline  Undergraduate  Flying  Training students  (Rated  and  CEA)  against  Formal  Training  Unit  (FTU)  capacity.  The  training command  allocates  approved  quotas  to  user  commands,  which  in-turn  allocate  training quotas  to  subordinate  units.    The  training  command  publishes  the  annual  PFT  quota workbook. 1.13.1.2.  Throughout  the  training  year,  MAJCOM  training  staff  and  PFT  managers  use assigned/allocated  training  quotas  to  assign  individual  crewmembers  to  formal  training quotas.  Daily  student  quota  adjustments  to  the  annual  PFT  are  made  on  quota management documents. 1.13.2.  Programmed  Flying  Training  (PFT).  AMC/A3TA,  in  coordination  with  A3TF  and 763 SCONS, balances commercial contractor training capacity and unit training requirements on an annual basis (FY or calendar year depending on the contract). Annually, units will send projected PFT requirements to their respective MAJCOM training staff. 1.13.2.1.  Throughout the training year, MAJCOM training staff, contract managers, and unit training managers use funded training quotas to assign individual crewmembers into formal schools. 1.14.  Information Management.  AMC/A3T functions as host of aircrew information and will maintain  an  electronic  library  of  aircrew  training  (syllabus,  training  guides  and  MOU)  on  a secure website. 1.15.  Failure to Progress or Complete Training. 1.15.1.  ATS contractors will identify students who fail to progress IAW the applicable ATS contract  as  outlined  in  Chapter  6.  If  a  crewmember  fails  to  complete  a  formal  course  the 18 AFI11-2EAV1  21 APRIL 2017 formal  school  will  notify  the  individuals  unit  as  well  as  AMC/A3TA  for  training determination. 1.15.2.  If  a  student  fails  to  progress  according  to  syllabus,  training  guide  or  requirements outlined  in  this  volume,  the  trainee’s  gaining  unit  SQ/CC  will  conduct  a  Progress  Review Board (PRB).  A PRB will review the trainee’s records and recommend continuing training, re-training,  modify  training,  or  action  IAW  AFI  11-402,  Aviation  and  Parachutist  Service, Aeronautical Ratings and Badges. 1.16.  Career Enlisted Aviators (CEA).  CEA are not tied to AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted), and skill level upgrade. All enlisted aircrew qualifications are separate  and  distinct  from  skill  level  qualification.    When  AF  Form  8,  Certificate  of  Aircrew Qualification,  as  prescribed  in  AFI  11-202,  Volume  2,  Aircrew  Standardization/Evaluation Program is completed for the applicable flight evaluation, then that crewmember is qualified to perform all duties assigned to that crew qualification regardless of skill level. Aircrew instructor qualification  and  flight  examiner  certification  are  also  separate  and  distinct  from  on-the-job trainer  (OJT)  trainer  or  certifier  designation  and  are  reflected  in  AFSC  by  use  of  “K”  prefix (aircrew instructor) and “Q” prefix (aircrew flight examiner). 1.17.  Aircrew  Training  Quota  Management.  The  following  information  describes  AMC’s policy and procedures for quota management.  This policy was developed from requirements in AFI  36-2201,  Air  Force  Training  Program  Training  Management;  AFI  36-2107,  and  AFI  11- 412, Aircrew Management, and is mandatory for all AMC units. PACAF and USAFE units will follow MAJCOM/A3T guidance. 1.17.1.  Programmed Flying Training (PFT).  The annual PFT requirement is established by the Operations Group based on unit projections of training needs for the following training year. The OSS/OST (or equivalent) forwards projected PFT/contractor training requirements for the next training year to the appropriate MAJCOM Contracting Officer and AMC/A3TA training manager by 15 June. With advanced notice, commercial contractor training capacity is normally sufficient to meet all PFT requirements. Late requirements may require flexibility on training dates and training times. 1.17.2.  Unit training PFT responsibilities are as follows: 1.17.2.1.  Schedule  students  for  contracted  ground  school,  simulator  training,  and  flight training through their flying unit. Units will contact the contractor’s scheduling office to schedule/confirm  each  training  class.  Normally  provide  the  class  start  date  to  attendees no  later  than  30  days  prior  to  class  start.    Unit  training  schedulers  will  comply  with individual contract scheduling lead time requirements. 1.17.2.2.  When  a  scheduled  training  class  cannot  be  filled,  the  Unit  will  notify  their respective OSS training office so the class may be reallocated.  If circumstances prevent an  identified  candidate  from  attending  the  training  (e.g.,  DNIF,  unable  to  complete prerequisite  training,  etc.),  inform  the  ATS  contractor  and  the  MAJCOM  contracting officer  immediately.    Every  effort  should  be  made  to  fill  a  vacated  slot.  Unit  training schedulers  will  be  familiar  with  contract  lead  time  requirements  for  cancelling  training without  incurring  a  financial  penalty.  Cancelling  training  inside  of  the  contract  cutoff date may lead to the contractor billing the Government (unit training funds) for the class. AFI11-2EAV1  21 APRIL 2017 19 1.17.2.3.  No-shows  and  late  cancellations  (outside  of  individual  contract  cancellation policies) must be explained.  Forward an initial report of circumstances to the MAJCOM contract manager, info AMC/A3TA within 24 hours of course start date. 1.17.3.  Issue applicable publications to attendees prior to start of training (gaining unit). 1.17.3.1.  Do  not  request  a  training  quota  until  host  MAJCOM  approves  request  for attachment.  Each  aircrew  member  scheduled  for  training  will  provide  an  endorsement letter signed by the supervisor certifying the individual is available for the required TDY and  there  is  no  known  pending  change  (permanent  change  of  station,  rated  position identifier code, etc.) that would preclude retention in a flying position for at least 2 years after course completion. 1.17.4.  Senior  Officer  Training  coordination.    All  Senior  Officer  training  is  directed  by AF/DPO,  AF/DPG  offices  in  coordination  with  MAJCOM  Senior  Leaders  Management office and AMC/A3TF.  Questions regarding Senior Officer training course, availability and prerequisites  can  be  forwarded  to  AMC/A3TF  @  DSN  779-3577.  No  formal  actions  to schedule  training  will  be  taken  until  directed  by  AF/DPO  or  AF/DPG  in  conjunction  with MAJCOM Senior Leaders Management offices. 20 AFI11-2EAV1  21 APRIL 2017 Chapter 2 INITIAL QUALIFICATION TRAINING 2.1.  General  Requirements.  AFI  11-202V1  defines  initial  qualification training.  This  chapter specifies  minimum  training  requirements  for  initial/mission  qualification,  re-qualification, conversion/difference qualification, and senior officer courses.  The primary methods of aircrew qualification  are  to  complete  the  appropriate  formal  contractor  training  course  described  in  the ETCA or when a formal course is unavailable, complete MDS specific training in-unit. 2.2.  Initial  Qualification  Training  Prerequisites.  Complete  initial  qualification  prerequisites in accordance with AFI 11-202V1, the ETCA website, this instruction, and the course syllabus or training  guide.  The  student  may  begin  training  (e.g.,  CBT)  prior  to  the  start  of  a  formal  initial qualification course. 2.2.1.  Initial qualification.  On completion of initial qualification training, crewmembers will be classified as basic aircraft qualified (BAQ). Crewmembers must then comply with mission qualification (Chapter 3) and continuation training (Chapter 4) requirements.  Navigators, CSOs,  FEs  and  FAs  may  train  on  operational  missions.  Therefore,  initial  qualification  and mission qualification training may occur simultaneously. 2.2.2.  In-unit training in lieu of formal school. When training classes are not available, units may request waivers to conduct in-unit qualification training using formal school courseware. In-unit training for ARC personnel should begin no later than 90 days after reporting or being attached  to  a  new  duty  station  or  unit.    The  appropriate  MAJCOM/A3T  (DOT/A3T)  or NGB/A3M is the waiver authority. 2.3.  Ground  Training  Requirements.  Complete  ground  training  requirements  for  initial qualification in accordance AFI 11-202V1 and this instruction. 2.3.1.  Events in Table 2.1 must be completed in-unit. This AFI is not the directive authority for all ground training. Individuals are responsible for completing additional ancillary ground training requirements as specified in AFI 36-2201 and other applicable instructions. Table 2.1.

Complete  flying  training  requirements  for  initial qualification in accordance with AFI 11-202V1 and this instruction. 2.5.  Conversion/Difference  Qualification  Training  Requirements.  Conversion/Difference Training guidance may be found in AFI 11-202V1.  When possible, qualified personnel in other units  will  provide  the  initial  cadre.  In  some  instances,  it  will  be  necessary  for  units  to  form  an initial  cadre  of  aircrew  personnel  for  whom  certain  training  qualification  requirements  may  be waived.    Initial  cadre  should  be  restricted  to  only  those  instructors  and  evaluators  required  to establish a core training force and not to alleviate training difficulties or shortfalls. The following conditions will apply to the management of initial cadre aircrew qualification: 2.5.1.  Conversion  Training.    Form  a  nucleus  of  instructor  and  flight  examiner  personnel (initial cadre) to begin aircrew conversion. Converting units may request initial cadre waiver of  PAI  time  requirement.  Send  waivers  request  through  MAJCOM/A3TA  or  NGB/A3M  in the format in paragraph 1.5.7.  Additionally, include the most recent aircraft flown and total time in that aircraft in the remarks section. 2.5.1.1.  Initial cadre will not be designated in a crew position higher than currently held unless previously qualified in the conversion aircraft. 2.5.1.2.  After  final  approval,  publish  a  unit  letter  to  identify  initial  cadre  of  instructors and flight examiners by crew qualification. 2.5.2.  Difference  Training.    Complete  difference  qualification  training  (DQT)  to  certify crewmembers in a different model aircraft within the same Mission Design Series (MDS) in-unitor in conjunction with simulator training. When crewmembers complete DQT for a MDS aircraft having the same mission as their current model, there is no requirement for additional mission qualification training.  Apply DQT for major modifications (i.e., Global Air Traffic Management  (GATM)-compliant  avionics,  flight  management  computer  differences)  as directed  by  MAJCOM.  Difference  training  may  be  applied  to  EA  MDS  transfers  (see  11-2EAV2 for specific MDS guidance). For fleet-wide modifications, apply initial cadre criteria in paragraph 2.5.1. 2.5.2.1.  Crewmembers will meet all initial qualification requirements in one aircraft prior to  entering  differences  training  in  another  model  aircraft.  EXCEPTION:  FAs  may accomplish simultaneous training in all C-20 and C-37 models and are considered current and  qualified  on  all  C-20  and  C-37  models  upon  completion  of  this  initial  qualification training.    CSOs  may  accomplish  simultaneous  training  in  the  C-32  and  C-40  and  are 22 AFI11-2EAV1  21 APRIL 2017 considered  current  and  qualified  on  both  aircraft  upon  completion  of  this  initial qualification  training.    FAs  may  accomplish  difference  training  between  the  C-32  and VC-25  when  already  mission  qualified  in  one  aircraft.    C-32  and  C-40  FAs  may accomplish  difference  training  following  an  initial  evaluation  in  one  aircraft  type  and simultaneous  training  for  all  future  upgrade  training  on  these  airframes.    Concurrent Pilot/FE C-37 A and B training is authorized. 2.5.2.2.  C-40  series  aircraft  (B  and  C)  are  considered  same  type  MDS  for  pilot qualification  and  evaluation  purposes.  There  is  no  requirement  for  C-40B/C  pilot differences training. FAs will complete a Differences Certification. 2.5.2.3.  Upon qualification/differences completion, an entry will be made in the aircrew member’s  Flight  Evaluation  Folder  (FEF)  or  unit  Letter  of  X’s,  reflecting  this qualification/difference training IAW AFI 11-2EAV2. 2.6.  Multiple Qualifications  . AFI 11-202V1 contains multiple qualification training guidance. Crewmembers maintaining multiple qualifications in different model aircraft will, as a minimum, maintain FTL A currency requirements in each aircraft qualified for pilots and navigators (N/A for senior officers; see paragraph 2.7.). See Table 4.3 for requirements. 2.7.  Senior  Officer  Qualification  Training  Requirements  .  AFI  11-202V1 identifies senior officer  qualification  requirements.  These  officers  are  assigned  FTL  E  for  continuation  training purposes and will not fly unsupervised in a primary crew position (see paragraph 4.3.1.4). 2.7.1.  After  qualification  IAW  AFI  11-202V1,  and  with  OG/CC  approval,  senior  officers (assigned  or  attached)  may  seek  training  which  leads  to  a  higher  FTL  and/or  qualification. The unit OSS/OST office is responsible for determining training requirements based on the senior officer’s flying experience and familiarity with the weapons system.  HQ AMC/A3T or  appropriate  MAJCOM  DOT/A3T  will  approve  the  proposed  training  plan  prior  to execution. 2.7.2.  Senior  Officers  that  complete  full  qualification  training  requirements  will  maintain FTL A continuation training requirements. 2.8.  Flight Surgeons  .  Flight Surgeons are allowed to fly locally as defined by OG/CC and log time  while  in  training  for  initial  (mission)  qualification.    See  AFI  11-202V1  for  training requirements. 2.9.  Re-qualification  Training  (RQT).  An aircrew member is unqualified upon  expiration of the qualification evaluation, loss of currency exceeding 6 months (for currency items specified in Chapter  4),  or  completion  of  a  qualification  evaluation  in  a  different  MDS  (EXCEPTION: When authorized multiple qualification).  The duration of unqualified time is from the date the aircrew  member  became  unqualified  until  the  specific  retraining  start  date.  For  Active  Duty Service Commitments for aircrew training, see  AFI 36-2107. See AFI 11-202V1 for additional re-qualification training limits and requirements. 2.9.1.  Unqualified crewmembers (up to 39 months at the end of a non-flying assignment or up  to  51  months  at  the  end  of  any  active  flying  assignment)  will  complete  in-unit  re-qualification course  and  a flight  evaluation.  (Note:  A waiver is  not  required for this in-unit re-qualification).  As  a  minimum,  unqualified  crewmembers  will  complete  training  in  all AFI11-2EAV1  21 APRIL 2017 23 delinquent  items,  additional  training  as  directed  by  the  squadron  commander,  and  a  flight evaluation. 2.9.2.  Basic  and  instructor  re-qualification  may  be  conducted  simultaneously  to  award  the highest  crew  qualification  previously  held  at  the  SQ/CC’s  discretion.  When  used,  the squadron  DOT  will  compare  basic  re-qualification  and  instructor  courses  and  provide  a recommended training outline to the SQ/CC that culminates in an instructor evaluation. 24 AFI11-2EAV1  21 APRIL 2017 Chapter 3 MISSION QUALIFICATION AND CERTIFICATION TRAINING 3.1.  Description.  This  chapter  establishes  minimum  criteria  and  training  requirements  for mission qualification and certification training. Except where specifically stated, squadrons may arrange  mission  sequence  or  sequence  of  items  as  necessary  to  use  flying  training  hours effectively and accomplish the unit mission. 3.2.  Time  Periods  for Mission Certification Training.  See paragraph 1.7 and Table 1.2. A crewmember  will  be  mission  ready  (MR)  after  completion  of:  all  ground  training  and  flying training  requirements,  review  and  certification  by  SQ/CC,  or  Review  and  Certification  (R&C) Board for aircraft commander (AC) according to AFI 11-202V2 AMC Supplement. 3.2.1.  Mission  ready  (MR)  requirements  must  be  completed  prior  to  being  designated mission  ready.  Local  training  or  operational  missions  may  be  flown  before  completing  all MR  items  provided  the  qualified  aircrew  member  has  a  current  flight  physical  and  has completed  physiological,  initial  ground  egress,  marshaling  (Pilot/FE),  and  aircrew  flight equipment familiarization. 3.2.2.  Prior  Qualification.  Upon  arrival  to  a  gaining  unit,  qualified  aircrew  members  in  the same  model  aircraft  as  the  gaining  unit  may  be  considered  qualified  at  the  same  level, however  local  area  orientation  must  be  accomplished.    Refer  to  MAJCOM  Supplement  for additional guidance. 3.3.  Ground  Training  Requirements.  All  crewmembers will accomplish events in  Table 3.1 (not  applicable  to  senior  officers  or  staff  officers  maintaining  BAQ).

BAQ crewmembers pursuing MR status will be assigned a Flight Training Level (see paragraph  4.3)  and  accomplish  continuation  training  requirements  IAW  Chapter  4. Continuation  training  requirements  will  be  prorated  based  on  the  training  time  start  date  as defined in paragraph 1.7.1.  Crewmembers will credit events accomplished during Mission Certification Training (MCT) IAW paragraph 4.4.1. 3.4.2.  Local  Area  Orientation.  After  arrival  at  duty  station  all  crewmembers  will  receive  a local  area  briefing.  Additionally,  pilots,  navigators  and  flight  engineers  will  receive  a  local orientation  flight.  This  orientation  will  familiarize  crewmembers  with  the  local  flying  area, local  area  flying  procedures,  and  introduce  any  unit/mission  unique  procedures.  This  flight may be completed in conjunction with initial/mission qualification sorties. 3.4.2.1.  Crewmembers  do  not  have  to  be  at  the  controls  to  complete  this  event.  More than  one  crewmember  may  be  trained  at  a  time.  With  OG/CC  (or  equivalent)  approval, the orientation may be completed on operational missions on a non-interference basis. 3.4.3.  Categories  II  and  III  ILS  Aircrew  Training.  This  prescribes  the  training  program  for pilots in aircraft that are command-certified for category II/III ILS.  This training should be conducted  at  ATS  contracted  simulator.    If  not  accomplished  during  initial  qualification training  and  annotated  on  AF  Form  8,  Cat  II/III  training  and  certification  will  be accomplished during Mission Qualification Training. 3.4.4.  Enhanced  Vision  System  (EVS)  Aircrew  Training.  This  prescribes  the  training program for pilots and copilots in aircraft that are equipped for EVS operations. This training and certification will be conducted at ATS contracted simulator. If not accomplished during initial qualification training and annotated on AF Form 8, EVS training and certification will be accomplished during Mission Qualification training. 3.4.5.  Aircraft  Defensive  Systems.    Does  not  need  to  be  tracked  as  a  separate  certification but  should  be  included  in  local  orientation  or  differences  training.  Training  should  include academic  and  flight  training.

Flight  Surgeon  Mission  Qualification  Requirements.  Flight  Surgeon  requirements  are outlined in and will be accomplished IAW AFI 11-202V1. AFI11-2EAV1  21 APRIL 2017 27 Chapter 4 CONTINUATION TRAINING 4.1.  Description.  This  chapter  establishes  the  minimum  flying  and  related  ground  training requirements  to  maintain  currency.  The  unit  commander  will  ensure  crewmembers  receive sufficient continuation training to maintain individual proficiency. 4.2.  Aircrew  Status.  Crewmembers  are  assigned  to  Mission  Ready  (MR),  Basic  Mission Capable (BMC), Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ), or Non-Mission Ready (NMR) status. 4.2.1.  Mission Ready (MR).  A mission-ready crewmember is defined as one who is current, qualified,  and  if  required,  certified  in  the  squadron’s  mission  (completed  mission qualification and certification training for applicable crew position). 4.2.2.  Non-Mission  Ready  (NMR).    A  crewmember  who  is  unqualified,  noncurrent  or incomplete in required continuation training, or not certified to perform the unit mission. See paragraph 4.9 for specific guidance on crewmembers who are non-current or incomplete in required continuation training. 4.2.3.  Basic  Mission  Capable  (BMC).    A  non-mission  ready  crewmember  assigned  to MAJCOM,  NAF,  EC,  DRU  or  FTU  who  has  satisfactorily  completed  mission  qualification training and does not  maintain MR status,  but  maintains  familiarization in  the command or unit  operational  mission.    The  crewmember  may  maintain  qualification  in  some  aspects  of the  unit  mission  and  is  able  to  attain  full  qualification  in  the  unit  mission  within  45-days. BMC  crewmembers  may  log  instructor  or  evaluator  time  for  the  portion  of  the  mission  for which they are current and qualified. 4.2.4.  Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ). A crewmember that has satisfactorily completed initial qualification training and is qualified to perform aircrew duties in the unit’s aircraft. 4.2.5.  MR,  BMC,  and  BAQ  crewmembers  must  accomplish  and/or  maintain the requirements in AFI 11-202V1 (for their respective status) and the appropriate events in the ground and semi- annual flying continuation tables Chapter 4. 4.3.  Flying Training Levels (FTL)  . 4.3.1.  The SQ/CC or designated representative determines the FTL before each semiannual period. Assign new unit crewmembers a FTL during in-processing. Base FTL determinations on experience and proficiency. 4.3.1.1.  FTL A - Highly Experienced Crewmembers (including BAQ highly experienced crewmembers pursuing MR status). This may include MR or NMR MAJCOM staff and NAF  personnel,  USAF  EC  instructors,  WG/OG/SQ/CCs,  operations  officers,  personnel assigned  to  OG  evaluation  positions,  and  any  instructors  assigned  primarily  to  staff duties. 4.3.1.2.  FTL  B  -  Experienced,  mission  ready  crewmembers  (As  a  guide,  crewmembers having between 5 and 10 years of operational flying experience). 4.3.1.3.  FTL  C  –  Mission  ready  crewmembers.  (As  a  guide,  crewmembers  having  less than  5  years  of  operational  flying  experience).  Initially  assign  inexperienced  MR 28 AFI11-2EAV1  21 APRIL 2017 crewmembers  and  individuals  pursuing  MR  status  after  initial  qualification  training  to FTL C. 4.3.1.4.  FTL E - BAQ or BMC non-instructor staff. FTL E may include senior officers, MAJCOM,  or  NAF  staff  who  are  not  maintaining  MR  or  instructor  status.  FTL  E requirements are insufficient for MR status and crewmembers assigned to this FTL will fly with an instructor of like specialty at all times. 4.3.2.  Change of FTL.  Once the semi-annual period begins, do not move a crewmember to a level  requiring  fewer  events.  EXCEPTION:    Units  associating  FTLs  with  crew  positions may  change  FTLs  after  upgrade  i.e.  instructor  upgrade.    Place  BAQ  crewmembers  into  a different  FTL  any  time  after  attaining  MR  status.  Prorate  events  upon  changing  training levels. 4.4.  Training  Events/Tables.  Standardized  ARMS identifiers  and descriptions are located in Chapter 7. Unit defined requirements will be designated “X” events (i.e., X020) and described in local training procedures. training  requirement   Credit  events  accomplished  on 4.4.1.

Initial  event  training  establishes  the  due  date  for  recurring training  (ex:  SS32  establishes  due  date  for  SS05).  Use  date  of  evaluation  as  the  date  of accomplishment  for all flying training currency  events  that were successfully accomplished during  the  formal  course  evaluation.  Continuation  training  events  accomplished  during upgrade  training,  prior  to  the  evaluation,  may  be  credited  towards  the  requirements  for  the current crew position.  Events accomplished during a successful evaluation may be credited towards  volume  training  in  the  upgrading  crew  position.    Use  the  evaluation  date  when logging these events. For aircraft that are considered same MDS (i.e. C-20H and C-37A), log continuation training events accomplished during differences training. 4.4.2.  Unsatisfactory  flight  evaluation.    Do  not  log  continuation  training  requirements  for those qualifications graded Q-3 until re-qualified. 4.4.3.  Satisfactory  make-up  training  (ground  or  flying)  is  creditable  towards  the  current training period. 4.4.4.  Instructor  training  requirements  and  responsibilities.  Instructors  and  flight  examiners may  credit  50  percent  of  their  total  requirements  while  instructing  or  evaluating. EXCEPTION: Instructor and flight examiner pilots may not credit any takeoffs, landings, or air refueling flown by another pilot. 4.4.5.  Documenting Aircrew Training. 4.4.5.1.  All training events will be recorded in ARMS. Training events conducted during block  training  may  be  consolidated  under  one  ARMS  entry.  Combined  training  events may  have  only  one  ARMS  entry.    Input  all  one-time  events  and  events  required  for permanent change-of-station (PCS) in the ARMS database. Units may maintain one-time events on the crewmember’s currency report. 4.4.6.  Simulator  Credit  for  Training  Events.  Crewmembers  may  log  continuation  flying events accomplished in the simulator unless otherwise specified in Tables 4.3 or Chapter 7.  Pilots may maintain or regain currency through events accomplished in the simulator. AFI11-2EAV1  21 APRIL 2017 29 4.4.7.  Simulator  Refresher  Course  Requirements.  ARC  pilots  may  credit  one  semiannual refresher  currency  requirement  during  an  individual’s  non-military  proficiency  training provided:  the  training  meets  all  USAF  performance  maneuvers  standards;  the  individual  is current and qualified on the same FAA type rated aircraft; and the individual’s non-military academic/simulator  training  plan  is  approved  by  AFRC/A3M  or  NGB/A3M.  NOTE:  Does not apply to semi-annual periods requiring a flight evaluation. 4.5.  Continuation Training Requirements. 4.5.1.  Completion and tracking of continuation training is ultimately the responsibility of the individual crewmember. Crewmembers will work with unit schedulers and training offices to ensure their continuation training is accomplished as described in this chapter. 4.5.2.  Ground Training Events.  Crewmembers will  comply with  requirements  of  Table  4.1 see Chapter 7 for event descriptions. 4.5.2.1.  Failure to accomplish requirements in Table 4.1 will result in non-mission ready status. See paragraph 4.9 to regain mission ready status. 4.5.2.2.  Failure to complete mobility training requirements shown of Table 4.2 does not lead to non-mission ready status but may restrict crewmember from certain missions. 4.5.2.3.  Ancillary  training  events  do  not  affect  mission  ready  status  nor  restrict crewmembers from any mission. 4.5.2.4.  Attached  crewmembers  (i.e.  AMC,  CVAM,  etc.)  may  accomplish  ground training  events  at  locations  other  than  their  units  of  attachment.  The  event  must  be approved  (i.e.,  meets  training  standards)  by  the  MAJCOM/A3TA.  Individuals  are responsible  for  reporting  all  accomplished  training  to  their  unit  of  attachment  ARMS office 30 AFI11-2EAV1  21 APRIL 2017 Table 4.1.

The AC or  their  designated  crewmember  must  also  give  FS  a  briefing  on  oxygen  equipment  and egress procedures prior to flight. Note: Initial Qualification requirements (in Chapters 2 and 3) only apply to the Flight Surgeon's primary aircraft. 4.6.1.1.  For  contingency/AOR  missions,  Flight  Surgeons  must  also  be  current  in  the following  events  (in  their  primary  aircraft):  SS02,  SS03,  SS05,  SS20  (S-V80-A),  and G120. 4.7.  Ancillary  Training  .  Ancillary  training  is  guidance  or  instruction  that  contributes  to mission accomplishment, but is separate from an Air Force Specialty or occupational series. AFI 11-2EA Volume 1 is not the governing directive for completion of ancillary training events.  In accordance  with  AFI  11-202,  Volume  1,  the  source  AFI  provides  training  frequency  for  these events  unless  an  approved  waiver  has  been  authorized.    See  Unit  Deployment  Manager representative to ensure compliance with additional non-aircrew specific training requirements. 4.8.  Proration of Training  . AFI 11-202, Volume 1 outlines proration of training requirements for  crewmembers  not  available  for  flying  duties  or  those  changing  training  levels.  Perform  the following  formula  steps  to  determine  training  requirements  for  a  select  training  period:  See Figure 4.1. Figure 4.1.  Formula Steps to Determine Training Requirements. Step 1 – Convert number of days available to number of months available (See Table 4.4.). Step 2 – Look up event currency required. Step 3 – Determine prorated event volume required using the following formula:                   Number of Months Available               X Event Volume               ÷ 6 (Number of Months in the Semiannual training period) = Prorated event volume required (round down to nearest whole number but not less than 1) 4.8.1.  Use Table 4.7 to determine the number of months available. Prorate only if absence is at least 15 cumulative days. 4.8.2.  When  an  individual  permanently  changes  station  (PCS)  to  a  unit  flying  the  same model  aircraft  and  enters  the  same  training  level  or  lower,  credit  may  be  taken  for  training accomplished at the previous base.  Prorate training requirements based on the time available (time at former base, plus time at new base, minus number of days not available) during the training period.  Time available starts 7 days after sign-in for CONUS and 14 days after sign-in  for  OCONUS.  Subtract  previous  accomplishments  from  the  prorated  total  to  determine remaining requirements. AFI11-2EAV1  21 APRIL 2017 37 4.8.3.  Units  may  also  prorate  requirements  for  individuals  changing  training  levels.    If requirements are prorated do not credit events accomplished while in the former FTL. Table 4.4.

Designate individuals NMR if they 1) fail to  maintain  flying  currencies  from  Tables  4.3,  2)  fail  to  complete  semi-annual  flying continuation training requirements from  Tables  4.3, or 3) fail to  complete  ground  continuation training requirements from Table 4.1. The following guidance applies: 4.9.1.  Failure to Maintain Flying Currency (Tables 4.3). 4.9.1.1.  Flight  Training  Currency.  Flight  currency  is  associated  with  those  events denoted in  the flying continuation training tables by  a  specific period of time (monthly, quarterly,  semi-annual,  or  annually)  within  which  an  event  must  be  accomplished.  A currency event must be accomplished at least once within that specified time in order to maintain the currency. 4.9.1.2.  Loss of Currency. Place individuals non-current in one or more currency events in  supervised  training  status  for  that  event  and  designate  them  NMR  in  those  unit missions  requiring  that  event.    Crewmembers  are  “non-current”  the  following  calendar day  after  event  currency  expires  (i.e.  a  crewmember,  who  accomplished  a  monthly currency event on 5 September, becomes non-current on 1 November). 4.9.1.2.1.  For  all  non-current  events,  place  individuals  in  supervised  training  status for  that  event  and  declare  them  NMR  in  unit  missions  requiring  the  event.  Loss  of currency prohibits an individual from accomplishing unsupervised in-flight duties in the non-current event(s).  See paragraph 1.5.5 for waiver authority. 4.9.1.2.2.  A  pilot  non-current  in  Takeoff  (P020),  Approaches  (P070),  or  Landings (P190) will not fly unsupervised on any sortie. 4.9.1.2.3.  Flight  surgeons  that  exceed  60  days  between  sorties  require  a  review  of aircraft  exits  and  oxygen  systems  conducted  by  a  member  of  the  flight  crew 38 AFI11-2EAV1  21 APRIL 2017 designated  by  the  Aircraft  Commander  (AC)  prior  to  the  flight  to  regain  flying currency. 4.9.1.2.4.  The egress review will be signed off by the AC on a copy of the AMC/SGP memo  or  other  approved  form  (e.g.,  AF  1522,  locally  generated  form/memo,  etc.). Note: documentation on AFTO 781 is not acceptable. The Flight surgeon must submit this  documentation  to  the  local  Squadron/Host  Aviation  Resource  Manager (SARM/HARM) office after the flight or upon return to home station if the flight is in conjunction with a TDY. The HARM or SARM will place the documentation in the flight surgeon‘s training folder. 4.9.1.2.5.  Failure  to  complete  and  document  required  training  before  the  flight  will result in the loss of ability to log primary flight surgeon time. 4.9.1.3.  Regaining Currency. 4.9.1.3.1.  Loss  of  Currency  up  to  6-Months.  Crewmembers  maintain  their  current training  level  and  no  training  folder  is  required.  Crewmember  must  demonstrate proficiency in the aircraft or ATD (as appropriate) in all delinquent items while under supervision  of  an  Air  Force  instructor  (or  ATS  contract  instructor  when  Table  4.3 permits regaining currency in the ATD). 4.9.1.3.2.  Loss  of  Currency  exceeding  6-Months.  Crewmember  is  designated Unqualified for a loss of currency for events specified in Table 4.3. The crewmember will  complete  Sq/CC  directed  requalification  training  (and  evaluation,  if  required) according  to  AFI  11-2EAV2.  For  all  other  currency  events,  regain  currency  by demonstrating  proficiency  in  the  aircraft  or  simulator  to  the  satisfaction  of  an  Air Force instructor (or contract instructor when Tables 4.3 permits regaining currency in the ATD) in all delinquent items. 4.9.2.  Failure to Complete Semi-annual Flying Training Events (Tables 4.3). 4.9.2.1.  The Sq/CC will review ARMS products at the end of each semi-annual training period.  For  individuals  who  fail  to  accomplish  training  requirements,  the  Sq/CC  will place individuals in supervised training status for the event(s) and designate them NMR in  those  unit  missions  requiring  the  event(s),  or  request  an  OG/CC  Waiver  for  the requirement (T-3, paragraph  1.5.8). 4.9.2.1.1.  If  an  OG/CC  waiver  is  not  accomplished,  place  individuals  who  have failed  to  complete  semi-annual  flying  training  events  in  supervised  status  for  the event(s) (crewmember flies with an instructor of like specialty) until SQ/CC directed re-training  is  accomplished.  Failure  to  complete  semi-annual  flying  training  events prohibits  an  individual  from  accomplishing  unsupervised  in-flight  duties  in  those events.  This  includes  aircrew  members  in  MCT  training  assigned  a  FTL  C  upon completion of their evaluation. 4.9.2.2.  Notify  the  MAJCOM/SG  when  Flight  Surgeons  fail  to  meet  semi-annual  or annual  sortie  requirements.  MAJCOMs  establish  procedures  to  assess  continued  active flying  authorization.  Place  a  copy  of  the  MAJCOM/SG  notification  in  the  member’s flight training folder. 4.9.3.  Failure to Complete Ground Training Events (Table 4.1). AFI11-2EAV1  21 APRIL 2017 39 4.9.3.1.  Individuals  who  fail  to  complete  ground  training  requirements  are  designated NMR. The crewmember cannot fly unsupervised until currency is  regained (Exception: Noncurrent crewmembers may fly unsupervised on local, routine, and CONUS missions according to Table 4.1 on sorties not requiring the ground training event.). 4.9.3.2.  Waivers  for  Ground  Training  Events.  The  OG/CC  or  equivalent  may  waive ground continuation training events identified by Note 5 of Table 4.1. (T-3) The decision to  grant  a  waiver  will  be  based  on  the  individual  crewmember‘s  experience  and proficiency level (i.e. waivers will not be based on a crewmember‘s availability). OG/CC will determine the allowable time period of the waiver. The make-up training should be accomplished  at  the  earliest  opportunity.  This  waiver  is  for  unforeseen  circumstances only and only for events that will not degrade mission accomplishment. 4.9.3.3.  An  individual  NMR  for  failure  to  complete  Hazardous  Cargo  Training  (G182) may fly unsupervised on local training missions only with Sq/CC approval until training is completed. 4.9.4.  Make-up training (ground or flying) is creditable towards the new training period. 4.10.  Requirements Before PCS or TDY by Rated Members on Active Flying Status.  AFI 11-202V1 specifies requirements before PCS or TDY. 4.11.  Requirements  Before  Removal  from  Active  Flying  Status.  AFI  11-202V1  specifies requirements before removal from active flying. 4.12.  Requirements  While  in  Inactive  Flying  Status.  AFI  11-202V1  specifies  requirements while in inactive flying status. 4.13.  Retraining.  AFI  11-202V1  specifies  retraining  restriction  before  separation,  retirement, or mandatory inactive flying status. 4.14.  Aircrew Flying in Non-US Air Force Aircraft and with Non-US Air Force Units.  AFI 11-202V1 addresses individuals flying in this status. 4.15.  Training  Period.  Continuation  training  program  is  based  on  static  6-month  periods  (1 January - 30 June and 1 July - 31 December). 40 AFI11-2EAV1  21 APRIL 2017 Chapter 5 UPGRADE TRAINING 5.1.  Description.  This  chapter  identifies  general  prerequisites  and  training  requirements  for upgrade. 5.1.1.  General.    The  flying  time  prerequisites  for  upgrade  are  based  on  the  crewmember having  gained  the  knowledge  and  judgment  required  to  effectively  accomplish  the  unit’s missions.  SQ/CCs  will  ensure  their  continuation  training  programs  emphasize  these  areas. Flying experience must include left seat time before entering formal school upgrade training. Crewmembers  will  have  an  in-depth  knowledge  of  systems,  procedures,  and  instructions before entering the formal upgrade program. 5.1.2.  OG/CC  is  designated  waiver  authority  for  flying  hour  prerequisites  for  entry  into formal upgrade courses.  (T-3) Table 5.1.  Upgrade Prerequisite Summary (Pilot).

Pilots remaining in BAQ status (certain staff positions, etc.) are required an Initial  Instrument/Qualification flight evaluation and unit commander certification board. Pilots  progressing onto mission ready status do not require a certification board for initial  instrument/qualification. 2.  Recommended by an instructor with the concurrence of the operations officer. 3.  Total/PAA time may be further restricted by OG/CC. See MAJCOM Supplement. 4.  All flying-hour requirements must be attained prior to starting an IP upgrade program. 5.  The unit training chief must ensure AF Form 63, is signed prior to beginning initial or  upgrade training according to AFI 36-2107.  Prior MDS instructor crewmembers going  through instructor upgrade in-unit incur no ADSC. Total flying hours represents all flying time logged aboard a fixed wing aircraft as a  “military” pilot including UPT, Student, and “Other” time (TFT does not include time in another aircrew specialty or RPA time).  Simulator time is creditable to meet TFT requirement.  6.  Flying time in C-37A and B may be credited towards required PAA time for upgrade.  7.  Previous MDS experience as required, per AFRC & NGB guidance.  5.2.  Mobility  Pilot  Development  (MPD).  MPD  is  the  AMC  continuous  upgrade  process designed to develop Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training (SUPT) graduates through aircraft commander  qualification.    OSA/EA  pilots  that  have  been  aircraft  commanders  in  other  major weapon  systems  (MWS)  enter  training  as  cross  flow  pilots.  However,  OSA/EA  pilots  should follow  the  MPD  program  timeline.  The  MPD  program  includes  the  Pilot  Initial  Qualification (PIQ) formal training course, continuation training, and upgrade to Mission Pilot (MP) training. All MPD pilots will be dual-seat qualified. MPD pilots are not Aircraft Commanders but should be  considered  in  continuous  aircraft  commander  training  upon  graduation  from  the  PIQ  course until MP certification. Training timelines are based on Table 5.1 and should be tailored to match an individual’s capabilities and experience level. 5.2.1.  Mobility Pilot Development (MPD) Overview. 5.2.1.1.  Squadrons  must  ensure  that  PIQs  get  balanced  exposure  to  the  left  and  right seats to ensure proficiency and currency with the flying and non-flying duties in both seat positions.  Squadron  Commanders  will  ensure  pilots  receive  sufficient training opportunities to gain experience prior to Aircraft Commander Upgrade. 5.2.1.2.  MPD  Continuation  Training.  This  training  involves  both  refresher  and  pilot proficiency  simulator  sorties  as  well  as  flying  training  conducted  during  local  and mission sorties. 5.2.1.3.  Certification.  A crewmember will be mission ready (MR) after completion of all ground  training  and  flying  training  requirements.  Additionally,  Aircraft  Commanders 42 AFI11-2EAV1  21 APRIL 2017 must  be  certified  by  the  SQ/CC  or  Review  and  Certification  (R  &  C)  Board  before performing duties as MP. 5.2.2.  Mobility Pilot Designation Codes.  Mobility pilot designation codes are IAW AFI 11- 401 AMCSUP 1, Aviation Management, AMC pilot designation codes. 5.3.  Aircraft Commander (MP)  . See minimum flying-hour requirements in Table 5.1. 5.3.1.  General.    The  flying  time  prerequisites  for  upgrade  are  based  on  the  pilot  having gained  the  knowledge  and  judgment  required  to  effectively  accomplish  the  unit’s  missions.  SQ/CCs  will  ensure  their  continuation  training  programs  emphasize  these  areas.  AC candidates will have an in-depth knowledge of systems, procedures, and instructions before entering  the  formal  upgrade  program.    Units  are  encouraged  to  develop  pilot  checkout programs  that  provide  and  track  seasoning  in  order  to  prepare  pilots  for  upgrade.  The following guidance applies: 5.3.1.1.  AC Candidate. All pilots are in continuous aircraft commander upgrade training and are considered AC candidates. 5.3.1.2.  Pilot  Checkout.  The  process  for  aircraft  commander  certification  consists  of completion  of  the  in-unit  upgrade  course  which  culminates  in  an  Operational  Mission Evaluation. 5.3.1.3.  AC Certification. Pilots  will not  be designated pilot  in  command until  certified as  an  aircraft  commander  by  the  SQ/CC.  Pilots  will  complete  all  “tasks  and  events required” in Table 5.1. 5.3.2.  Global Ready Aircraft Commander Course (GRACC). GRACC is a multi-step process designed to familiarize the new mobility aircraft commander with the intricacies of operating in the AMC enroute system.  GRACC is not required for OSA/EA pilots, however, pilots are invited to attend if not previously accomplished. One time course completion is transferable between  all  AMC  weapons  systems.  Previous  or  current  MAF  aircraft  commanders  do  not have to take this course. Waiver authority is OG/CC or equivalent. 5.3.2.1.  GRACC training guides can be downloaded from the AMC/A3T web site, AMC enroute  training  link.  HQ  AMC  Orientation  Tours  can  be  scheduled  via  email  with AMC/A3TF (A3T.quotamanagement@scott.af.mil) or at DSN 779-3576. 5.4.  Aircrew  Instructor  Program.  Course  is  designed  to  teach  selected  crewmembers fundamentals  and  concepts  of  instructing.  Instructor  candidates  will  be  selected  based  on experience, judgment, ability to instruct, flying skill, and technical knowledge. In-unit upgrade is the primary method for IP qualification training. 5.4.1.  Prerequisites.    See  Table  5.1,  Table  5.2  and  this  section  for  instructor  upgrade prerequisites. 5.4.1.1.  Instructor  Preparatory  Course  (IPC).    All  instructor  candidates  must  have attended an IPC at a formal Air Force school or at the unit level. 5.4.1.1.1.  IPC  Guidance.    Unit  level  IPC  will  be  conducted  according  to  a  plan submitted  to  and  approved  by  the  appropriate  operations  group  and  MAJCOM training  office.  Primary  instructors  will  maintain  course  content  and  update  when necessary.  A  record  of  course  attendees  will  be  maintained  for  at  least  2  calendar AFI11-2EAV1  21 APRIL 2017 43 years. An AF Form 1256, Certificate of Training will be issued to each graduate and signed by the primary instructor. Unit level  IPC operating instructions are permitted and encouraged. 5.4.1.1.2.  Unit level IPC. Each IPC program will have a primary instructor appointed by  the  applicable  squadron  commander  to  be  responsible  for  course  content, scheduling, records, and training of new IPC instructors. IPC staff may be of any size but should be limited to only enough to accomplish unit requirements. 5.4.2.  Ground Training. 5.4.2.1.  An instructor must be thoroughly familiar with aircraft systems and equipment, normal  and  emergency  operating  procedures,  prohibited  maneuvers,  and  aircraft performance  under  all  conditions  of  flight.    Instructor  candidates  will  demonstrate knowledge by organizing and conducting ground briefings on a cross-section of subjects from  applicable  directives.  Briefings  may  be  conducted  as  part  of  the  existing continuation  training  or  flying  safety  program,  but  the  briefing  must  be  critiqued  by  a same crew position instructor for content, organization, and delivery. 5.4.2.2.  The instructor candidate will receive ground training on training documentation requirements. 5.4.2.3.  Instructor candidates from all crew positions will satisfactorily complete written examinations  prior  to  qualification  or  requalification.  Examinations  will  be  prepared, administered and controlled by the ATS contractor or unit A3V/CCV, according to AFI 11- 202V2 and AFI 11-2EAV2.  Record examination results on an AF Form 8. 5.4.3.  Flying Training. 5.4.3.1.  IP candidates may occupy either seat during training. Emphasis will be on right-seat proficiency, maneuver techniques, practice instruction, practical emergency situation set-up, and operating aircraft systems. A minimum of one touch and go landing should be accomplished in the left seat, emphasizing the differences in  cockpit layout and aircrew duties that affect left seat instructing. 5.4.3.2.  An  initial  instructor  flight  evaluation  is  required  and  validated  by  certification board. Instructor candidates will demonstrate to a flight examiner their ability to instruct and perform selected maneuvers and items according to applicable directives. 5.4.3.3.  Instructor  proficiency  guidelines.    In  the  first  quarter,  following  upgrade, emphasis  should  be  placed  on  flying  the  newly  certified  IP  in  the  local  pattern  to reinforce upgrade training and to gain experience in the local flying environment. 5.5.  Flight  Examiner  Certification.  Squadron  commanders  will  identify  instructors  for  flight examiner  certification.  Instructors  identified  for  certification  as  flight  evaluator  must  possess satisfactory  knowledge  of  AFI  11-202,  Volume  2,  AFI  11-2EAV2,  and  applicable  MAJCOM supplements.  All  flight  examiners  must  be  fully  qualified  instructors  (EXCEPTION:  NAF/CC or OG/CC). 5.6.  Upgrade Prerequisite Summary (Pilot & All other crew Positions).  Refer to Table 5.1, Table 5.2, and MAJCOM Supplement for upgrade prerequisites. 5.6.1.  Mission Ready Upgrades. 44 AFI11-2EAV1  21 APRIL 2017 5.6.2.  Aircraft Commander (MP).  Flying time prerequisites required for upgrade are based on  an  FP  having  gained  knowledge  and  judgment  required  to  effectively  command  unit missions.  Upgrade  to  MP  requires  demonstrated  proficiency  in  mission  planning,  pre-departure,  in-flight,  and  post-flight  procedures,  special  procedures  and  systems  before certification. In-Unit Upgrade is the primary method for MP qualification training. 5.6.3.  Mission  Ready  Flight  Engineer  (MF).    Upgrade  to  MF  requires  demonstrated proficiency  in  mission  planning,  predeparture,  in-flight,  post-flight  procedures,  special procedures and coordination, and aircraft taxi procedures (if required) before certification. 5.6.4.

Prior MDS instructor crewmembers going  through instructor upgrade in-unit incur no ADSC. 4.  VC-25 Flight Engineer 5.7.  Special  Qualifications  and  Certifications.  Certain and certifications are trained after completion of formal qualification and do not affect mission ready status.  Special  qualifications  and  certifications  may  require  an  evaluation  or  only  an  AF  Form 4324 update. These programs are usually taught at the unit level by Air Force instructors of like specialty. aircrew  qualifications 5.8.  Pilot  Tactics  Program  .  This section outlines the training and continuation requirements for  a  pilot  to  fly  tactical  flight  procedures.  NOTE:  Maneuvering,  to  include  threat  response, beyond pilot, flight manual, or aircraft limitations is prohibited. PAG is exempt. 5.8.1.  Prerequisites.  Aircraft  Commanders  and  above  shall  receive  tactics  procedures training.  Mission-qualified  pilots  (FPQ)  may  receive  tactics  training.  Initial  training  should be  conducted  via  simulator  and  may  be  incorporated  into  AC  upgrade  training.    Recurrent training/currency  may  be  completed  in  aircraft  or  simulator.  Tactics  events  may  be accomplished  from  the  left  or  right  seat.  Tactical  events  may  not  be  credited  by  observing from the jump seat. 5.8.2.  Training Program.  Unit Commanders are responsible for implementing their tactical maneuver  training  program.    As  a  minimum,  this  program  should  include  ground  training that  emphasizes  aircraft  defensive  capabilities/limitations,  inflight  contingencies  when operating  in  a  potential  threat  environment,  and  specific  flight  maneuvers  to  be  conducted when a threat is encountered. Initial training should be accomplished in the simulator. 5.8.3.  Training  Documentation.    Units  are  encouraged  to  include  this  training  as  part  of Aircraft Commander upgrade, or initial/mission qualification training. This training program is not required to be tracked via a letter of X’s. 5.8.4.  Continuation  Flying  Requirements.    Once  qualified,  currency  requirements  may  be accomplished in the simulator, or in the aircraft on a non-interference basis.  Emphasis is on using  the  simulator  to  maintain  currency.  A  separate  local  training  sortie  will  not  be generated  to  accomplish  this  training.  For  flying  continuation  training  requirements,  see Table 4.3. 46 AFI11-2EAV1  21 APRIL 2017 Chapter 6 AIRCREW TRAINING SYSTEM (ATS) 6.1.  Description.  OSA/EA  training  contractors  provide  academic,  simulator,  and  technical training to USAF crews operating commercial derivative aircraft.  The Air Force conducts flight training and evaluations. 6.1.1.  Training  is  conducted  at  the  contractors  Federal  Aviation  Administration  (FAA) approved  training  center  by  FAA  certified  instructors.  Initial  training  shall  be  to  the commercial  Airline  Transport  Pilot  (ATP)  Type  Rating/Certification  standard.  USAF difference training is conducted in unit. 6.2.  Applicability  .  As  defined  in  AFI  11-202V1.  The  ATS  is  civilian  contractor-provided aircrew training in  concert with Air Force instruction. This chapter applies to all crewmembers attending  formal schools using  ATS courseware  or attending ATS initial, upgrade, or  refresher training.  Simulator training contracts govern USAF-contractor relationships and obligations and may only be modified by the contracting officer. Units will not levy additional requirements on contractors.  Contact  the  MAJCOM  training  office  with  recommended  changes  to  the  aircrew training program. 6.3.  Dedicated Training Time.  As defined in AFI 11-202, Volume 1. 6.3.1.  It  is  imperative  that  students  complete  their  training  in  a  timely  and  uninterrupted manner.  Students  will  enroll  on  a  full-time  basis  and  be  relieved  from  duties  not  directly related to training.
