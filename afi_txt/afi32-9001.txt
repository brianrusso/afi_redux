Army  and  Air  Force  Exchange  Service  (AAFES).  In  general,  Air  Force  appropriated funds  cannot  be  used  for  AAFES  for  real  property.    However,  this  does  not  prevent  Air  Force exchanges  from  using  public  buildings  or  public  transportation  that,  in  the  opinion  of  the SECAF,  are  not  needed  for  other  purposes.    Reference  10  USC  §  9779(b),  Use  of  Public Property  and  AFI  65-106,  Appropriated  Fund  Support  of  Morale,  Welfare,  and  Recreation (MWR) and Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities (NAFIS).  1.12.1.

Appropriated  funds  are  authorized  for  the  use  or  possession  of non-DoD  lands,  buildings,  and  their  improvements  and  installed  equipment  for  a  specified period  through  contract,  lease  agreement,  or  other  legal  instrument  for  AAFES  when authority  is  granted  through  appropriate  channels.    Reference  AFI  34-201,  Use  of Nonappropriated Funds (NAFS), and AFI 65-106. 1.13.  Title  Sufficiency.  No  money  may  be  expended  to  purchase  land  or  any  interest  in  land that meets the requirements listed below unless the sufficiency of title to the land, for the purpose for  which  it  is  being  acquired,  has  been  approved  in  accordance  with  delegations  from  the Department  of  Justice  (40  USC  §  3111,  Approval  of  Sufficiency  of  Title  Prior  to  Acquisition).  Direct USACE to initiate the title sufficiency when an acquisition meets the following criteria: 1.13.1.  Fee simple. 1.13.2.  Easement. 1.13.3.  Lease that has a term of greater than 30 years. AFI32-9001  28 SEPTEMBER 2017 15 1.13.4.  Construction on non-fee land. 1.14.  Air Installation Compatible Use Zone (AICUZ).  The Air Force may need to acquire RP interests to ensure the operational integrity of military airfields in the US and in territorial areas administered  by  the  US.    Reference  AFI  32-7063,  Air  Installation  Compatible  Use  Zones Program. 1.15.  Relocatable  Conversion.  Conversion  of  relocatable  buildings  (i.e.,  equipment)  to  RP  is accomplished  in  accordance  with  AFI  32-1021,  Planning  and  Programming  Military Construction (MILCON) Projects. 1.16.  Decision  Matrix  .    To  determine  the  appropriate  real  estate  instrument  and  interest required to satisfy the mission needs, use the matrix provided below at Table 1.1.  This matrix is intended to be a guide and provided for real estate planning purposes.  This does not convey any authority to execute a real estate instrument. Table 1.1.

When  only  the  minimum  interest  in  land  is  required, non-exclusive use should be obtained.  When the Air Force has acquired non-exclusive use from a property owner, that property owner may also  convey non-exclusive rights to other parties in the same area that has been acquired by the Air Force.  The Air Force may pay a nominal fee. 2.2.  Licenses  .  The License is the instrument for acquiring temporary, non-exclusive interest in non-federal property and provides the Air Force the privilege to use or pass over another party’s real estate for a specific purpose.  A license is typically used for training purposes, such as field training exercises and temporary drop zones.  It may also be used for tree topping, construction laydown areas, and temporary access. 2.2.1.  Licenses are short term, typically less than one year and not to exceed a 5-year term.  Any request for more than a 5-year term must be approved by AFCEC/CI.  (T-1) 2.2.2.  Licenses  for  environmental  monitoring  have  specific  rules.    Each  instrument  for continued  use  shall  not  exceed  five  years.    However,  if  monitoring  is  required  for  longer durations, a new instrument must be accomplished at the end of every 5-year term.  Contact AFCEC/CIT for further guidance. 2.2.3.  In place of clearance easements, a license may be acquired to remove or stop natural growth protruding into aircraft glide paths. 2.2.4.  If  construction  is  required,  a  license  cannot  be  used.    See  Chapter  3  for  rules governing exclusive use. 2.2.5.  Right  of  Entry.    A  Right  of  Entry  (ROE)  is  a  form  of  license  and  grants  the  least interest available through a real estate instrument.  The Air Force may obtain rights of entry for uses such as surveys, environmental sampling, and for temporary access. 2.2.6.  Include all pertinent requirements found in Chapter 1, paragraph 1.4, and evaluate for compliance. 2.3.  Congressional  Notification.  Regardless  of  the  instrument  issued  to  the  Air  Force,  where substantial investment has been made by the Air Force, notify Congress prior to any termination or modification of the instrument.  Reference 10 USC § 2662(a)(1)(F). 2.4.  Permits  .  Permits are agreements between federal agencies and can be acquired for non-exclusive use.  A permit is required if acquiring interest in another Federal property.  The Permit process is discussed in Chapter 4. 2.5.  Easements  .  Easements may be acquired for a term or in perpetuity.  When acquired for a term  (i.e.,  a  short  term  right  of  way),  these  are  considered  temporary  interests.    Easements  in perpetuity are the preferred interest for utilities and roadways.  The  Air Force may also acquire restrictive easements in perpetuity for purposes such as encroachment protection, safety arcs, or avigation.  For easements required in perpetuity, see Chapter 5.   AFI32-9001  28 SEPTEMBER 2017 17 2.5.1.  Easement Consent.  A consent grants permission to the Air Force to cross over another easement,  owned  by  anyone  other  than  the  Air  Force.    These  are  often  required  when acquiring  linear  easements.    Consent  is  the  written  permission  granted  to  the  Air  Force  to cross  all  existing  easements  and  is  required  prior  to  easement  execution.    A  copy  of  the consent from the easement-holder(s) should be retained in the easement acquisition file. 2.5.2.  Installation REOs are responsible to  verify  the need for and must  request  and obtain the written consent from the easement holder prior to easement execution. 2.5.2.1.  Include  all  pertinent  requirements  found  in  Chapter  1,  paragraph  1.4  and evaluate for compliance. 2.5.3.  When  acquiring  a  term  easement,  request  AFCEC/CI  approval  prior  to  any construction of permanent improvements. 2.5.3.1.  Construction  on  Land  Not  Owned  by  the  United  States.    Requests  for construction  on  term  easements  must  be  forwarded  to  AFCEC/CI  for  appropriate  level approval. 18 AFI32-9001  28 SEPTEMBER 2017 Chapter 3 TEMPORARY, EXCLUSIVE USE 3.1.  Leases.  GSA is the primary leasing agent for the United States (see para 4.3); however, the Air  Force  may  enter  into  leases  up  to  12  months  using  O&M  funds  when  it  is  not  possible  to arrange lease of buildings and/or facilities through GSA. 3.2.  General.  The United States may enter into leases, subject to approvals and available funds.  It must pay rentals when due.  When proposing to lease property, an Air Force activity must: 3.2.1.  Ensure  that  the  buildings  and  facilities  are  compliant  with  the  Americans  with Disabilities Act (ADA). 3.2.2.  Give preference to  leasing buildings that use solar heating and cooling equipment  or other renewable energy sources. 3.2.3.  Ensure the lease provides for the right to terminate in whole or in part, at the option of the  Government,  allowing  the  Government  the  greatest  flexibility  to  vacate  the  premises.  Negotiate the terms  of the lease so there are no  penalties or costs  associated with  the early termination  of  a  lease.    If  costs  or  penalties  are  associated  with  early  termination,  contact AFCEC/CIT Action Officer for additional information. 3.2.4.  Ensure the property is compliant with occupational safety, fire, and health hazards. 3.2.5.  REO must ensure funds are available before executing any lease or option to renew. 3.2.6.  Include all pertinent requirements found in Chapter 1 and evaluate for compliance. 3.3.  Lease  Acquisition  Authority.  The  Air  Force  may  acquire  direct  leased  space  for  the following categorical uses as delegated by GSA in 41 CFR Part 102-73.155, What types of space can  Federal  agencies  acquire  with  a  categorical  space  delegation?    A  non-inclusive  list includes: 3.3.1.  Hangars  and  other  airport  operating  facilities  including,  but  not  limited  to,  flight preparation space, aircraft storage areas, and repair shops. 3.3.2.  Housing (temporary), including hotels (does not include quarters obtained pursuant to temporary duty travel or employee relocation). 3.3.2.1.  Family  Housing  (FH)  Lease.  FH  leases  are  authorized  and  budgeted  through Military  Family  Housing  (MFH)  authorities.    Adhere  to  procedures,  controls,  and reporting requirements set forth in AFI 32-6001, Family Housing Management. 3.3.3.  Hospitals, including medical clinics. 3.4.  Lease Acquisition Approval.  If mission requirements determine that acquisition of leased space is  necessary, the  following list  of actions  must be approved through AFCEC/CI, prior to considering the acquisition of any lease involving (T-1): 3.4.1.  Leasehold condemnations. 3.4.2.  RP requiring a certificate of necessity (See paragraph 3.10.). 3.4.3.  Land intended for construction (See paragraph 3.15.). AFI32-9001  28 SEPTEMBER 2017 19 3.4.4.  Commercial (industrial-type) property. 3.4.5.  RP on which a purchase option is required. 3.4.6.  RP within the limits of a civil airport. 3.4.7.  RP that is subject to recapture or reversionary clause. 3.4.8.  Port storage facilities (land or water) affecting the transfer or interchange of cargo. 3.4.9.  RP within the National Capital Region (NCR). 3.4.10.  RP planned for flying activities. 3.4.11.  GSA leased space. 3.4.12.  Firm term leases longer than one year. 3.5.  Options for Renewal.  Leases are term documents.  Options for renewals must be included within  the  conditions  of  the  original  lease.    The  absence  of  this  language  within  the  lease document  may  prohibit  the  Air  Force  from  executing  renewals  under  the  original  lease.  Successive leases of the  same property beyond the original  term  requires  higher level  approval through AFCEC/CI. 3.6.  Leasing  Unaccompanied  Housing.    MAJCOMs  may  authorize  installations  to  lease  or contract  for  Unaccompanied  Housing  (UH)  facilities  for  Priority  1  and  2  personnel  when adequate government-owned quarters are unavailable.  Adhere to procedures set forth in AFI 32-6005, Unaccompanied Housing Management. 3.7.  Limitations on Rents: 3.7.1.  The fair market rental value will be determined by an appraisal that considers the lease term and FMV. 3.7.2.  The present value of the minimum lease payments over the life of the lease shall not exceed 90 percent of the fair market value of the asset at the beginning of the lease term. 3.7.3.  If the rental payments over the term of the lease or any subsequent lease at the same location  approach  75  percent  of  the  FMV,  consideration  must  be  given  to  purchase  of  the property in lieu of a lease prior to entering into a lease. 3.8.  Limitations on Alteration, Improvement, and Repair of Leased Facilities (T-0): 3.8.1.  This limitation applies to leases that include facilities or land with improvements.  It does  not  apply  if  the  lease  is  for  unimproved  land.    Cost  for  altering,  improving,  and repairing a leased facility must not exceed: 3.8.1.1.  30% of the rent for the first year of the rental term. 3.8.1.2.  30% of the total rent, if the term is less than one year. 3.8.1.3.  30% of the term of the lease and options to renew. 3.8.1.4.  30% limitation above applies to leases of non-FH.  For limitations on FH leases reference AFI 32-6001, Family Housing Management. 3.8.2.  Nominal  Consideration  and  Rent-Free  Leases.    The  cost  for  altering,  improving,  or repairing  is  considered  "rent"  under  nominal  consideration  leases.    Spend  no  more  than 20 AFI32-9001  28 SEPTEMBER 2017 $2,000  or  20%  of  the  fair  market  value  of  the  leased  premises,  whichever  is  greater,  each year of the rental term.  Use the FMV of all the buildings included in the lease rather than the value of one building when determining the maximum amount to spend on one building.  Do not split alteration or construction projects into segments that do not provide a complete and usable facility. 3.8.2.1.  The limitation on nominal or rent-free leases above applies to leases of non-FH.  For limitations on FH leases, see AFI 32-6001, Family Housing Management. 3.8.3.  See Chapter 6 for specific OCONUS leasing requirements and limitations. 3.9.  Exceptions  to  Limitations.  Spending  limitations  for  altering,  improving,  or  repairing leased buildings do not apply to the cost of: 3.9.1.  Installed equipment and other detachable items. 3.9.2.  Restoration at the end of a lease. 3.9.3.  Repairs needed because of malicious mischief by Government employees or damages not covered by the lease. 3.9.4.  Alterations and improvements that come under the MILCON Authorization Act. 3.10.  Certificate  of  Necessity.  A certificate of necessity is permission to exceed the limits set in  paragraphs  3.7  and  3.8.    Installations  must  send  requests  for  a  certificate  of  necessity  to AFCEC/CI  for  approval.    Do  this  before  obligating  funds  that  exceed  these  limitations.    With your request, include (T-1): 3.10.1.  Completed  DD  Form  1391  or  other  approval  documentation  as  required  by  the project. 3.10.2.  Single-line drawing. 3.10.3.  Statement of cost, scope, and type of work already done. 3.10.4.  Identification  of  work  not  classified  as  leasehold  improvements,  such  as  movable partitions and shelving. 3.10.5.  The installation must keep records of alterations, improvements, or repairs for each leased building, portion of a building, or other RP improvements.  These records serve as a basis  for  determining  the  need  for  a  certificate  of  necessity  when  the  cumulative  total  of expenditures has reached the allowable limit. 3.10.6.  Once the certificate of necessity is issued, stay within its limitations in terms of work and  cost.    Request  a  new  certification  to  do  additional  unspecified  work  or  request  an amendment if costs exceed original approved amounts. 3.10.7.  For  OCONUS  leases,  a  certificate  of  necessity  will  be  processed  through AFCEC/CFE for USAFE and AFCEC/CFP for PACAF installations. 3.11.  Payment  for  Leases.  Installations  must  designate  a  finance  office  to  make  payment  for leases executed by or for the Air Force. 3.11.1.  For  airport  property  rentals,  Joint  Use  Agreements  cover  costs  associated  with  the specific jointly used flying facilities (runways, taxiways, etc.).  Other costs must be covered under the lease.  Reference AFPD 10-10, Joint Use of Military and Civilian Flying Facilities. AFI32-9001  28 SEPTEMBER 2017 21 3.11.2.  Do not pay leasehold rents in  advance except in foreign countries (see  Chapter 6).  The Air Force may pay rent in advance to states and state agencies. 3.11.3.  Support Services.  Payment for utilities and other services not included in the cost of the lease rent must be paid through an appropriate agreement.  Typically, this is done with a services contract or operating agreement. 3.12.  Restoration  of Leased  RP.  The Air Force pays costs associated with the restoration per conditions of the lease. 3.13.  Recording  Leases.  Air  Force  does  not  always  record  its  leases  in  public  land  records.  Recording  them  may  be  beneficial,  however,  in  cases  where  the  Air  Force  determines  that  a failure  to  record  them  might  prejudice  Air  Force  rights  under  the  lease.    Reference  RET Playbook. 3.13.1.  If  required,  leases  may  be  recorded  in  public  land  records  through  the  use  of  a Memorandum of Lease.  Contact AFCEC/CIT for additional information and assistance with preparing a Memorandum of Lease for purposes of recording. 3.14.  AAFES Leases  : 3.14.1.  Do not use appropriated funds to lease property for activities of AAFES facilities in the  United  States  and  in  territorial  areas  administered  by  the  United  States.    Reference  10 USC § 9779, Use of Public Property. 3.14.2.  In  foreign  countries,  use  appropriated  funds  to  lease  structures  and  related  RP  for AAFES  facilities  for  five  years  or  less.    This  requirement  does  not  preclude  assignment  of space in Air Force-leased buildings to AAFES, even though non-appropriated funds are used for AAFES leases in the United States.  For more information on AAFES leases, see AFI 34-211(I), Army and Air Force Exchange Service General Policies. 3.15.  Construction  on  Land  Not  Owned  by  the  United  States.  Installations  must  send requests for construction on land not owned by the United States to AFCEC/CIT for appropriate level  approval.  (T-1)  Exception:    On  leased  property  for  ANG,  construction  of  facilities  is allowed if the Air Force has 25 or more years remaining on the term of the lease.  Reference 10 USC § 2852, Military Construction Projects: Waiver of Certain Restrictions.  The following data must be included: 3.15.1.  Summary of the lease term and conditions. 3.15.2.  Map showing location of construction. 3.15.3.  Rental value of the property. 3.15.4.  How long the RP is needed. 3.15.5.  Estimated  cost  of  existing  Government  facilities  and  proposed  new  Government construction. 3.15.6.  Estimated cost to restore the RP to the condition that existed when it was leased or to a condition stated in the lease document. 3.15.7.  Special circumstances that SAF/IEI needs to approve. 3.15.8.  Justification for special terms or conditions. 22 AFI32-9001  28 SEPTEMBER 2017 3.16.  Subordination,  Nondisturbance  &  Attornment  (SNDA).  SNDA  is  a  multi-party agreement  between the  United States of America, property owner, and a third party in  interest, typically  a  mortgage  lienholder  that  has  a  financial  interest  in  the  leased  property.    When acquiring through lease in order to protect the Governments interests, an SNDA is required.  This will usually be necessary when a leased property is being sold.  (T-2)  Reference RET Playbook. 3.17.  Parking Space for Privately Owned Vehicles of Military and Civilian Personnel  .  Do not  acquire  parking  spaces  by  lease  unless  it  is  associated  with  a  lease  of  a  facility  or  space within a facility.  (T-1) 3.17.1.  To  request  exceptions  to  this  rule,  installation  commanders  send  requests  for exceptions with justification for AFCEC/CI approval.  Request exceptions for: 3.17.2.  Civilian volunteer workers. 3.17.3.  ADA Compliance. 3.17.4.  Visitors. 3.17.5.  Property in areas with local zoning ordinances that prohibit commercial parking lots. 3.17.6.  Assigned personnel to whom the rule causes substantial hardship. 3.18.  Lease  Purchase.  The  Air  Force  may  acquire  certain  facilities  through  a  lease  purchase when  the  purchase  offers  economic  and  other  advantages  to  the  Government.    It  must  be consistent with the Government’s goals and mission requirements.  The Government must be the sole  or  major  tenant  of  the  building,  and  have  a  long  term  need  for  the  property.    Any  lease purchase may not exceed 32 years.  Reference 10 USC § 2812, Lease-Purchase of Facilities. 3.19.  Operating  Leases  and  Capital  Leases.  The Office of Management  and Budget  (OMB) Circular  No.  A-11,  Preparation,  Submission,  and  Executing  the  Budget,  Appendices  A  and  B, define the criteria for an operating lease.  Operating leases must meet all the criteria listed below.  If the criteria are not met, the lease will be considered to be a capital lease or a lease-purchase as appropriate and must be scored by OMB.  (T-0) 3.19.1.  Ownership of the asset remains with the lessor during the term of the lease and is not transferred to the Government at or shortly after the end of the lease term. 3.19.2.  The lease does not contain a bargain-price purchase option. 3.19.3.  The lease term does not exceed 75% of the estimated economic life of the asset. 3.19.4.  The present value of the minimum lease payments over the life of the lease does not exceed 90% of the fair market value of the asset at the beginning of the lease term. 3.19.5.  The  asset  is  a  general  purpose  asset  rather  than  being  for  a  special  purpose  of  the Government and is not built to the unique specification of the Government as lessee. 3.19.6.  There is a private sector market for the asset. 3.20.  Scoring  of  Operating  Leases.  Operating leases that include termination costs should be evaluated as described by OMB Circular A-11, Appendix A.  (T-0) AFI32-9001  28 SEPTEMBER 2017 23 Chapter 4 UNIQUE ACQUISITION PROCESSES 4.1.  Permits From Other DoD or Federal Government Agencies.  The Air Force may request permits  from  other  DoD  or  Federal  Government  agencies  granting  either  exclusive  or  non-exclusive use of RP under the agencies' control. 4.1.1.  Request approval through AFCEC/CI if construction is anticipated on the property. 4.1.2.  Permits  acquired  from  a  DoD  agency  will  be  at  no  cost.    A  support  agreement  is required  and improvements, maintenance, utilities, custodial, and other services. typically  provides  reimbursable  costs  associated  with 4.1.3.  Permits  acquired  from  Non-DoD  agencies  may  be  at  fair  market  value  rent,  only  if required by the host agency, in addition to support services. 4.1.4.  Include all pertinent requirements found in Chapter 1, paragraph 1.4, and evaluate for compliance. 4.2.  Withdrawals  of  Public  Land.  Send  all  requests  for  withdrawals  of  public  land  through AFCEC/CI for SAF/IEI approval.  If the proposed withdrawal is more than 5,000 acres, comply with  the  Federal  Land  Policy  and  Management  Act  of  1976,  Congressional  Declaration  of Policy (43 USC § 1701); and 43 USC § 155, Withdrawal, Reservation, or Restriction of Public Lands for Defense Purposes; “Public Lands” Defined; Exception).  The following data must be included with all requests for withdrawals: 4.2.1.  Name and address of the applicant. 4.2.2.  A statement of the authority delegated by the SecAF to act as a representative. 4.2.3.  Type of withdrawal action. 4.2.4.  Detailed description of exterior boundaries. 4.2.5.  Color-coded map showing boundaries, public domain, and excepted areas. 4.2.6.  Gross and net land and water acreage. 4.2.7.  Proposed use of land (if classified, so state). 4.2.8.

Include a legal description of the area to be overlapped or added to the existing withdrawal. 4.2.9.  Describe extent and duration of any temporary segregation (43 CFR Part 2300,  Land Withdrawals, General), and recommend land use allowable during segregation. 4.2.10.  Explain  why  the  withdrawal  is  necessary,  and  why  a  right  of  way  or  a  cooperative agreement would not serve. 4.2.11.  State the duration of withdrawal. 24 AFI32-9001  28 SEPTEMBER 2017 4.2.12.  State whether any suitable alternative sites are available as well as suitable sites for the uses the action will displace. 4.2.13.  If suitable alternative sites are available, include a cost analysis. 4.2.14.  Indicate whether you need to bring in water to fulfill the purpose of the withdrawal. 4.2.15.  Identify the repository for records on the property. 4.3.  GSA Controlled Space: 4.3.1.  All  requests  for  GSA  general  purpose  space  (GSA-owned  or  leased)  outside  the National  Capital  Region  (ONCR)  must  be  submitted  to  AFCEC/CI.    Use  SF  Forms  81, Request  for  Space,  and  81-A,  Space  Requirements  Worksheet,  to  request  approval.  AFCEC/CI will approve requests as appropriate and submit to GSA for acquisition. 4.3.2.  Send  requests  for  space  within  the  National  Capital  Region  (NCR)  to  SAF/AAO safaao.workflow@pentagon.af.mil to start the fact finding process and investigate beddown options.    Request  should  contain  organization’s  mission,  vision,  UMD/positions  listing  and adjacency needs.  Reference DoDI 5305.05, Space Management Procedures for the National Capital  Region  and  AFI  32-9010,  Management  and  Reporting  of  Air  Force  Space  and Building Services in OSD Assigned Facilities and in the Washington DC Area. 4.3.3.  Space  Alterations.    GSA  works  with  the  Air  Force  during  design  development  to ensure that the design meets Air Force needs.  GSA pays for the initial space alteration and charges this back to the user by amortizing the cost over the OA term. 4.3.4.  Relocating From GSA Space.  If GSA directs an ONCR Air Force activity to relocate to another GSA space, AFCEC/CI approval is not necessary, unless annual rent for the new space exceeds: 4.3.4.1.  The rent of the old space; or 4.3.4.2.  $200,000 per year. 4.3.5.  GSA  Reimbursable  Work.    GSA  is  reimbursed  for  work  such  as  alterations,  guard service, and special cleaning services. 4.3.5.1.  Submit  work  requests  for  GSA  space  outside  the  NCR  to  the  GSA  building manager on GSA Form 2957, Reimbursable Work Authorization.  This form is available from the GSA building manager responsible for the space the Air Force is using. 4.3.5.2.  Submit  work  requests  for  GSA  within  the  NCR  to  SAF/AAO  in  according  to AFI 32-9010. 4.3.6.  Payment  for  GSA-Controlled  Space  and  Services.    Air  Force  activities  using  GSA-controlled space must pay for all space and services.  Reference 40 USC § 586, Charges for Space and Services. 4.3.6.1.  GSA sends annual rent bills as well as a "reconciliation" bill to: 4.3.6.1.1.  AFCEC/CI, for ONCR space. 4.3.6.1.2.  WHS, for NCR space.   AFI32-9001  28 SEPTEMBER 2017 25 4.3.7.  AFCEC/CR  or  DoD,  as  appropriate,  pays  the  GSA  rent.    However,  GSA  sends  bills for  both  recurring  and  nonrecurring  reimbursables  directly  to  the  paying  office  of  the  Air Force  activity  occupying  the  GSA-controlled  space,  as  cited  on  GSA  Form  2957.    All  Air Force activities occupying GSA-controlled space must transfer funds to AFCEC/CR who is the OPR for all Air Force GSA payments. 4.3.8.  Termination  of  Assignment  of  GSA  Space.    Submit  all  notifications  of  intent  to terminate ONCR and NCR GSA space to AFCEC/CIT or WHS, as appropriate.  GSA must receive written notice 120 days before the termination date. 4.3.8.1.  The  OA  includes  the  termination  notice  required,  typically  a  minimum  of  120 days.  The Air Force activity is responsible for the rent until the OA is terminated. 4.3.9.  Restoration of GSA Space.  GSA pays for restoration of GSA space.  The Air Force activities using GSA-controlled space must pay  for damages that  go beyond "fair wear  and tear."  Send any disagreements over restoration to AFCEC/CIT (for ONCR space) or WHS (for NCR space). 4.4.  Lease Acquisition Through USACE.  The USACE may obtain space on behalf of the Air Force provided that: 4.4.1.  GSA grants authority to the USACE; or 4.4.2.  GSA designates the space as "special purpose" suitable only for Air Force or DoD use. 4.5.  Acquisition by Reversion  .  The Air Force may reacquire land previously disposed either through  special  legislation  or  BRAC  disposal  only  if  the  quitclaim  deed  included  specific language authorizing a reversion.  AFCEC/CIT is responsible for initiating a reversionary action.  Installation  needs  to  request  AFCEC/CIT  support  in  writing  and  provide  the  appropriate information as requested. 4.6.  Acquisition by Recapture  .  Recapture by the Air Force is limited to recapture of certain disposed  properties  needed  for  national  defense.    A  recapture  clause  is  a  pre-negotiated, temporary condemnation of former federal property triggered by a specific condition, usually a declaration of war or national emergency.  Reference RET Playbook for additional information. 4.6.1.  Certain properties may have significant value to the DoD should a national emergency such  as  a  natural  disaster  or  proclamation  of  war  occur.    Many  of  the  DoD  properties disposed at the end of World War II contained recapture clauses. 4.6.2.  Once the condition triggering the recapture has been resolved, the Government returns the property to the owner. 4.6.3.  Use leases to obtain the use of RP subject to recapture. 4.6.4.  Do  not  pay  for  rental  of  such  property  during  a  national  emergency.    Reference National  Emergencies  Act  of  1976,  50  USC  §  1601,  Termination  of  Existing  Declared Emergencies, et seq. (National Emergencies Act). 4.6.5.  Pay  for  rental  of  such  property  if  the  owner  constructed,  added  to,  and  paid  for  the property with non-Federal funds. 26 AFI32-9001  28 SEPTEMBER 2017 4.7.  Mineral Rights  .  Air Force policy is to have Government ownership of the mineral rights when acquiring title to RP.  Government owned mineral rights give the Air Force administrative control of mineral exploration and extraction activities on Air Force property. 4.7.1.  Mineral  rights  are  not  always  acquired  with  the  acquisition  of  surface  rights.    A mineral  right  estate  is  severable  from  a  land  estate.    In  the  event  the  mineral  rights  are severed,  installation  must  submit  a  written  request  to  AFCEC/CIT  to  work  with  SAF/GCN for a recommendation on acquisition of those mineral rights before any final decision is made on the mineral estate. 4.7.2.  Acquisition of lands from the public domain through formal withdrawal grants the Air Force use of the surface rights for a specific purposes and duration.  All subsurface mineral rights  remain  under  the  jurisdiction  of  BLM  and  BLM  should  consult  with  the  Air  Force prior to granting public access to those subsurface minerals. 4.7.3.  While BLM has authority over  all federal  subsurface mineral  rights, an out-lease for mineral  exploration  or  extraction  on  an  Air  Force  installation  cannot  be  done  without  Air Force written consent. AFI32-9001  28 SEPTEMBER 2017 27 Chapter 5 ACQUIRING PERMANENT INTERESTS 5.1.  Authorization.  The Air Force is authorized to acquire a permanent interest in RP under 10 USC  §  2663,  Land  Acquisition  Authorities;  2684a,  Agreements  to  Limit  Encroachments  and Other  Constraints  on  Military  Training,  Testing,  and  Operations;  2802,  Military  Construction Projects; or 2803, Emergency Construction. 5.1.1.  All permanent interest acquisitions require AFCEC/CI notification regardless of value.  At the time of AFCEC/CI notification, approval authority will be determined in accordance with current delegations. 5.1.2.  Acquisitions greater than $1M in value or 1,000 acres are not authorized, pursuant to DoDI  4165.71,  Real  Property  Acquisition,  without  advance  approval.    All  acquisitions meeting or exceeding this threshold must have OSD approval before any public disclosure of the proposed acquisition is made.  Reference Chapter 1, paragraph 1.4.6.  (T-0) 5.2.  MILCON Land Requirements.  MILCON programmers must notify the installation REO and  identify  needed  land  interests  as  part  of  a  MILCON  project.    Installation  MILCON submittals  are  done  in  compliance  with  AFI  32-1021,  Planning  and  Programming  Military Construction (MILCON) Projects.  5.2.1.  Acquisitions  with  an  estimated  value  exceeding  $750,000  require  Congressional Notification through the MILCON program.  Reference Chapter 1, paragraph 1.5. 5.2.2.  MILCON  programmers  must  include  appropriate  administrative  costs  in  the  cost estimate for land acquisitions. 5.2.3.  The Installation REO will prepare a Directive for the USACE Engineering District to prepare a REPR.  Send AFCEC/CIT a copy of the Directive. 5.2.4.  The Installation REO will provide the REPR to the MILCON programmer to prepare the DD Form 1391. 5.2.5.  After  a MILCON project  is  approved, the  Installation may direct  USACE to acquire the RP required for the project on behalf of the Air Force.  Air Force provides USACE funds from the MILCON appropriation to acquire the RP for the project. 5.2.5.1.  If  the  approved  MILCON  project  increases  by  10%  of  acreage  or  space  or  by 25% of the original MILCON project cost, ensure the MILCON programmer is notified before proceeding with final action. 5.3.  Land  Acquisitions  Under  $750,000.  Reference  10  USC  §  2663,  Land  Acquisition Authorities. 5.3.1.  The  Air  Force  may  acquire  permanent  interest  in  un-programmed  land  requirements costing less than $750,000.  This amount does not include administrative costs. 5.3.2.  Installations  must  request  approval  for  the  acquisition  through  AFCEC/CI  prior  to entering into negotiations for purchase of the RP. 28 AFI32-9001  28 SEPTEMBER 2017 5.3.2.1.  ANG installations must request approval for the acquisition through NGB/A4A prior  to  entering  into  negotiations  for  purchase  of  the  RP.    NGB/A4A  will  forward  to AFCEC/CI for SAF/IEI approval. 5.3.3.  The Air Force may acquire permanent interest for larger requirements that cannot wait for a MILCON project because the need is urgent.  The urgent acquisition must be approved by SAF/IEI through AFCEC/CI.  (T-1) 5.3.3.1.  If the urgent acquisition is approved, SAF/IEI, through AFCEC/CI, shall submit  Congressional  Notification  containing  a  description  of  the  property  and  interest  to  be acquired and the reasons for the urgent acquisition. 5.3.3.2.  Notification must be submitted within 10 days of approval. 5.4.  Gifts.  The Air Force may accept gifts of RP for military use.  Reference AFI 51-601, Gifts to the Department of the Air Force. 5.4.1.  Send all gift offers of RP through AFCEC/CIT for AFCEC/CI or SAF/IEI acceptance. 5.4.1.1.  Send  all  RC  gift  offers  of  RP  through  NGB/A4.    NGB/A4  will  forward  to AFCEC/CIT for AFCEC/CI or SAF/IEI acceptance. 5.4.2.  All gift offers involving construction should include all relevant bonds and insurance. 5.4.2.1.  If the  gift offer  does not  include bonds  or insurance, the  installation must state why the donor will not provide. 5.4.2.2.  Upon construction completion, the donor will transfer title to the Air Force and complete a DD Form 1354 or provide equivalent information. 5.4.2.3.  Maintain,  on  behalf  of  the  Air  Force,  an  accurate  and  complete  real  property inventory  in  accordance  with  DoDD  4165.06,  DoDI  4165.70,  and  DoDI  4715.14.    A complete real property inventory consists of all sites, including all lands and facilities, for which the Air Force has real property accountability, regardless of the organization using or  funding  the  facility  or  land.  (T-0).    Reference  AFI  32-9005,  Real  Property Accountability and Reporting. 5.4.3.  If  the  gift  is  title  to  land,  ensure  title  sufficiency  is  provided  before  sending  the  gift offer to AFCEC/CIT.  Ensure that there are no title defects or outstanding liens. 5.5.  Transfers  From  Another  Military  Department.  The  Air  Force  may  acquire  property from  other  Military  Departments  without  compensation.    Request  SAF/IEI  approval  through AFCEC/CI for all transfers of RP.  Reference 10 USC § 2696, Real Property: Transfer Between Armed Forces and Screening Requirements for Other Federal Use. 5.6.  DoD  Excess  RP.  Installations  may  find  property  previously  declared  excess  by  the  Air Force  or  another  military  service  that  satisfies  a  new  or  current  mission  requirement.  Installations  shall  forward  to  AFCEC/CIT  requests  to  recall  disposal  directives  if  property declared excess is found to be suitable for a mission requirement.  All attempts will be made to acquire the DoD excess property.   AFI32-9001  28 SEPTEMBER 2017 29 5.7.  Non-DoD  Excess  RP.  To  acquire RP that non-DoD agencies report  as excess,  follow the guidelines set in 41 CFR Chapter 101, Federal Property Management Regulations. 5.7.1.  The  Air  Force  must  pay  100%  of  the  property's  appraised  fair  market  value,  unless OMB waives the requirement.  (T-0) 5.7.2.  When  the  Air  Force  wants  to  acquire  such  excess  RP  to  meet  an  Air  Force requirement, Installation Commander must: 5.7.2.1.  Submit request to AFCEC/CIT to notify GSA within the time limit specified in the screening letter. 5.7.2.2.  Explain why the acquisition is necessary. 5.7.2.3.  Provide the Declaration of Excess (DE) if the acquisition replaces other RP.  See AFI 32-9004, Disposal of Real Property, for details on preparing a DE. 5.7.3.  The  Installation  Commander,  with  advance  knowledge  that  another  Government agency is to report RP as excess, may ask for a transfer.  Request can occur before the other agency reports the excess to GSA's federal property resources service. 5.8.  Bombing  and  Gunnery  Ranges.  To  acquire  land  for  bombing  and  gunnery  ranges, comply  with  this  Instruction  and  AFIs  13-212,  Range  Planning  and  Operations,  and  32-7064, Integrated Natural Resources Management. 5.9.  Restrictions  on  Using  Non-appropriated  Funds.  DoDD  1015.6,  Funding  of  Morale, Welfare,  and  Recreation  Programs  prohibits  the  purchase  of  RP  with  nonappropriated  funds unless the purchase involves privately owned buildings located on Government property.  (T-0) 5.9.1.  Installation  Commander  must  request  exceptions  from  the  Air  Force  Headquarters Board  of  Directors  or  the  Chief  of  the  respective  central  nonappropriated  fund  activity (examples are the Air Force Services Council; the AAFES; or the Air Force Civilian Welfare Fund) and the SecAF.  (T-1) 5.9.2.  Use  nonappropriated  funds  according  to  current  Air  Force  funding  guidelines.    See AFIs  32-1022,  Planning  and  Programming  Nonappropriated  Fund  Facility  Construction Projects and 34-205, Services Nonappropriated Fund Facility Projects for more guidance. 5.10.  Perpetual Easements.  Easements provide the Air Force the use of another party’s RP for a specified purpose in perpetuity, while the landowner continues to use the balance of the surface rights.  Easement may also be acquired for a term.  See Chapter 2 for details on term easements. 5.10.1.  Easements  are  often  linear  in  nature  (roads,  utilities,  pipelines)  and  can  be  called  a right of way. 5.10.2.  Construction on Land Not Owned by the United States.  Requests for construction on perpetual  easements  are  not  required  as long as the easement conveys the specific  rights  to construct, operate and maintain the infrastructure to be constructed. 5.10.3.  Restrictive, conservation, avigation, clearance,  clear zone, and safety  easements  are all examples of easements that should be acquired in perpetuity whenever possible to protect current and future missions at the installation.   30 AFI32-9001  28 SEPTEMBER 2017 5.10.3.1.  Readiness  and  Environmental  Protection  Integration  (REPI)  Program.    The REPI  Program  supports  cost-sharing  partnerships  between  the  Air  Force,  private conservation  groups,  and  state  and  local  governments  to  preserve  compatible  land  uses and  sustain  wildlife  habitat  near  installations  and  ranges  where  the  Air  Force  operates, tests,  and trains.   Reference 10 USC § 2684a, Agreements  to  Limit Encroachments  and Other Constraints on Military Training, Testing and Operations. 5.10.4.  Include  all  pertinent  requirements  found  in  Chapter  1,  paragraph  1.4  and  evaluate for compliance. 5.11.  Easement  Consent  .    Consents  grant  permission  to  the  Air  Force  to  cross  over  another easement,  owned  by  other  than  the  Air  Force.    These  are  often  required  when  acquiring  linear easements.    Consent  is  the  written  permission  granted  to  the  Air  Force  to  cross  all  existing easements  and  is  required  prior  to  easement  execution.    A  copy  of  the  consent  from  the easement-holder(s) should be retained in the easement acquisition file. 5.11.1.  All consents issued by the Air Force after the easement is acquired shall be retained in the acquisition file. 5.11.2.  Installation REOs are responsible to verify the need for and must request and obtain the written consent prior to easement execution. AFI32-9001  28 SEPTEMBER 2017 31 ACQUIRING RP IN TERRITORIAL AREAS AND FOREIGN COUNTRIES Chapter 6 6.1.  Roles and Responsibilities  . 6.1.1.  Installation REO 6.1.1.1.  The REOs will submit all known or anticipated real estate requirements for each fiscal year to the appropriate OCONUS points of contact (POC) by 15 January. 6.1.1.1.1.  The requirements will be separated into existing leases that are continued, leases that are canceled and proposed new leases to include the anticipated costs for the coming fiscal year. 6.1.1.1.2.  The REO will inform the installation budget office of changes to projected costs of leases. 6.1.1.2.  The  REO  coordinate  any  questions  or  changes  arising  during  the  course  of  the lease  with  the  appropriate  base  level  agencies,  as  well  as  with  the  OCONUS  POC  for final approval and signature. 6.1.2.  OCONUS POC 6.1.2.1.  The OCONUS POC for all Air Force real estate actions in foreign countries are AFCEC/CFE for USAFE-AFAFRICA and AFCEC/CFP for PACAF, or the person acting in their capacity. 6.1.2.2.  The OCONUS  POC may lease structures and related RP within their delegated authority.  This does not include "build to lease" projects. 6.1.2.3.  The  OCONUS  POC  will  decide  whether  existing  government-to-government agreements or other arrangements with the host country will meet requirements. 6.1.2.3.1.  Where  applicable,  the  Joint  Committee,  established  by  Status  of  Forces Agreement  (SOFA)  or  other  international  agreement  between  the  United  States  and the  host  nation,  shall  serve  as  a  means  for  consultation  in  determining  the  facilities and  areas  required  by  the  United  States  in  the  host  nation  for  carrying  out  the purposes of the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation or multilateral international agreement, and security. 6.1.2.3.2.  The in-theater Air Force Component Commander is the primary authority for  determining  facility  requirements  for  Air  Force  Forces  stationed  in  the  host country. 6.1.2.4.  The OCONUS  POC ensures rent  paid  for leased property is  fair, the leases  are legal,  and  the  acquisition  complies  with  the  terms  of  the  foreign  military  rights agreement. 6.1.2.5.  The  OCONUS  POC  forwards  a  copy  of  the  executed  acquisition  documents  to AFCEC/CI, if applicable. 32 AFI32-9001  28 SEPTEMBER 2017 6.1.2.6.  The  OCONUS  POC  must  keep  records  on  all  leased  properties  held  overseas.  The Air Force should attempt to relocate activities into no-cost host nation or US funded facilities and dispose of excess leaseholds when possible. 6.2.  OCONUS  Territorial  Acquisition.  RP  acquisitions  within  the  US  territorial  areas  are similar  to  acquisitions  within  the  Continental  United  States  (CONUS),  except  the  applicable Installation  must  first  coordinate  its  request  for  government-owned  RP  with  the  local representative  from  one  of  the  following  agencies  depending  on  the  jurisdiction  of  the  land involved: 6.2.1.  Bureau of Land Management. 6.2.2.  Department of Interior. 6.2.3.  Department of the Navy. 6.2.4.  The  Federal  Aviation  Administration  (FAA)  regional  office  for  RP  under  FAA control. 6.2.5.  Other applicable agencies. 6.3.  OCONUS  Foreign  Acquisitions.    Within  foreign  countries,  the  Air  Force  may  lease structures  and  RP  related  to  structures  that  are  needed  for  military  purposes  or  for  FH.  Installations may also  consider a lesser interest, such as a license or easement, if the Air Force does not require exclusive use of the RP.  Reference 10 USC §§ 2675 Leases: Foreign Countries and 2828, Leasing of Military Family Housing. 6.4.  Methods of Foreign Acquisition.  There are three methods of acquisition: 6.4.1.  No cost through host nation, including follow-on construction. 6.4.2.  Joint use with a host nation whose construction criteria may not match US standards. 6.4.3.  Lease of privately owned property. 6.5.  Acquiring  Property  within  OCONUS  Commands'  Jurisdiction  .    If  the  requirement falls under existing agreements, process the RP acquisition as follows: 6.5.1.  The  OCONUS  POC  obtains  host  country  approval  in  accordance  with  existing government-to-government  agreements.    The  OCONUS  POC  sends  a  formal  acquisition request through established channels to the host country. 6.6.  Acquiring  Property  outside  OCONUS  Commands'  Jurisdiction.  If  the  proposed  land requirement falls outside the OCONUS Command jurisdiction or cannot be met within existing agreements, then process the RP acquisition as follows: 6.6.1.  The  OCONUS  POC  sends  the  proposal  to  AFCEC/CI.    AFCEC/CI  processes  the requirements through DoD and the Department of State. 6.6.2.  OCONUS POC must provide complete information and justification in the request, as with  all  requests  for  RP.    Exercise  care  not  to  take  any  action  that  might  jeopardize  the transaction. 6.7.  Acquisitions  outside  Foreign  Government  Agreements  .    Property  should  be  acquired within the framework of any existing government-to-government and subsidiary agreements.  If a RP requirement arises in a country without an agreement or if the requirement falls outside the AFI32-9001  28 SEPTEMBER 2017 33 scope of existing agreements, the OCONUS POC will refer to the General Information Volume of DoD 4500.54-E, DoD Foreign Clearance Program (FCP), Chapter Four: “Requests for USAF Foreign Operating Rights, Foreign Military Rights, and Foreign Surveys.” 6.7.1.  Negotiating  with  foreign  governments  requires  approval  from  the  correct  authorized   Reference  AFI  51-701,  Negotiating, entity  (State  Department,  Ambassador,  etc.). Concluding, Reporting, And Maintaining International Agreements. 6.8.  Leasing.  AFCEC/CFE  and  AFCEC/CFP  may  lease  property  in  the  private  sector,  if  the government-to-government agreement or foreign military agreement allows it.  They may lease directly from private or corporate owners or indirectly through a government agency of the host nation. 6.8.1.  USAFE-AFAFRICA  Installations  prepare  lease  packages  IAW  Attachment  2  and submit lease packages to AFCEC/CFE for processing. 6.8.2.  Installations  must  prepare  lease  packages  in  Hawaii  and  Alaska  IAW  Chapter  3  of this AFI.  PACAF Installations must submit to AFCEC/CFP for processing. 6.9.  Advance  Approval.  Approval  “In  Principle”  (AIP)  for  Leases  in  USAFE-AFAFRICA.  AFCEC/CFE  approves  in  principle  leases  in  foreign  countries  when  the  lease  best  meets  Air Force  requirements.    Submit  AIP  request  to  AFCEC/CFE  prior  to  taking  any  actions  towards locating a facility or entering noncommittal negotiations. 6.9.1.  Advance  approval  for  Family  Housing  leases  in  foreign  countries  is  required.  Reference AFI 32-6001, Family Housing Management. 6.10.  Payment of Leases.  The rent for each annual period may be paid from funds appropriated to the Air Force for that year.  Leases in foreign countries are paid  as local customs dictate, to include payment in advance.  Reference 10 USC § 2396, Advances for Payments for Compliance With  Foreign  Laws,  Rent  in  Foreign  Countries,  Tuition,  Public  Utility  Services,  and  Pay  and Supplies of Armed Forces of Friendly Foreign Countries and DoD FMR, Volume 10, Chapter 12, Contract Payment Policy and Procedure.   6.10.1.  To  make  advance  rental  payments  for  RP  in  foreign  countries  above  the  local approval level, send a justification certificate to AFCEC/CI for approval. 6.11.  Leasing AAFES Facilities.  If adequate facilities are not available within the confines of a base, appropriated funds may be used for leasing structures and related RP that are exclusively required for AAFES activities in foreign countries.  However, the lease cannot exceed limitations as  described  in  HAF  MD  1-18  and  associated  delegation  letters.    This  does  not  prevent assignment  of  space  in  Air  Force  leased  buildings  to  AAFES.    Reference  10  USC  §  2675, Leases: Foreign Countries and AFI 65-106. 6.12.  Construction  on  Leased  Property  in  Foreign  Countries  (O&M  leases  or  non  FH leases).  Where  construction,  alteration,  or  improvement  of  facilities  is  proposed  on  RP  in foreign  countries,  leases  (including  options  to  renew)  must  be  for  the  maximum  term  allowed under 10 USC § 2675, Leases: Foreign Countries so that the US may maximize its return on its capital improvement investment. 6.12.1.  Construction, alteration, and improvement of leased property in  foreign countries is allowed, provided such work is done at the lowest cost and is consistent with the US planned requirement and the maximum period of use. AFI32-9001  28 SEPTEMBER 2017 6.12.2.  The Installation REO will submit an approval request to the OCONUS POC for any construction, alteration, and improvement of leased property that exceeds 30% of the cost of the annual lease rent.  See Chapter 3 for specific requirements.  (T-2) 6.12.3.  The Installation REO will prepare a request for a certificate of necessity, as detailed in  Chapter  3,  paragraph  3.10,  and  submit  to  the  OCONUS  RE  POC  for  processing  and SAF/IEI approval.

Usually, owners of the property continue in possession and can use it so long as such use does not interfere with the  purpose  for  which  easement  was  granted.    An  example  is  a  right  of  way  easement,  which provides for the right to pass over property of another for a specific purpose.  Such use could be for constructing a road or for installing pipelines, pole lines, or telephone cables.  An easement differs from a license in that:  The privilege granted usually cannot be withdrawn during its term. It is considered to be a "permanent" interest in the property if the term exceeds 1 year.

Lesser interests shall be considered before acquiring fee title and vary by level of interest conveyed, organization relationship, time duration, and ease of termination.  Leases are also considered lesser interests, but due to their complexity, leases are addressed separately in Chapter 3. Lessor—One  who  holds  title  to,  and  conveys  the  right  to  use  and  occupy  a  property  under  a lease. License—Grants nonexclusive use or right to pass over private property for a specific purpose.  Unlike an easement, it may be revoked at will.
