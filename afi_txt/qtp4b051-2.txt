Notes: *This QTP is limited to the task steps involved with calculating the mean, median, and mode of a given set of numbers.     7                  Journeyman Training Guide:  Basic Mathematics  TASK STEPS AFQTP 4B051-2    1.  Determine the mean.1 2.  Determine the median.2 3.  Determine the mode.3   LOCAL REQUIREMENTS:    NOTES:   The equation for calculating the mean can be given as:  1.  The mean is usually symbolized as 𝑥𝑥̅ and called “ x bar.” 𝑥𝑥̅= ∑𝑥𝑥𝐺𝐺                       Where: x   = the mean value                                    Σx = sum of all values for x                                     n  =  total number of data points  Example: Find the mean of the set of values:  5, 2, 3, 6.                       First add all the numbers in the set (x1 to xi).                       5 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 16                       Secondly, count the total number of values (find n)                       n = 4                       Finally, divide the sum of the values (x1 to xi) by the number of                       values in the set (n).                                  mean  =  x   =  16  =  4                                                            4 2.  Consider the following sample data:  50  35 20 65 90 120 100 45 35 90 40 8                  Journeyman Training Guide:  Basic Mathematics  𝑥𝑥̅= ∑𝑥𝑥𝐺𝐺 = 69011 =62.73 AFQTP 4B051-2   The average, or mean:         The median would be determined by aligning the data with the smallest number at one end and the highest at the other:  20  35 35 40 45 50 65 90 90 100 120 In this case the median will be at 50.  Note the difference between mean and median. 3.  The value that occurs most frequently is called the mode.  There may not be a mode (if no value repeats), or there may be more than one mode (if more than one value is repeated.  Using the same set of numbers:        35 There are two modes, 35 and 90. 20  35  40  45  50  65  90  90  100  120   9  AFQTP 4B051-2                     Journeyman Training Guide:  Basic Mathematics  TRAINEE REVIEW QUESTIONS  STS Line Item 3.2.6:  Use basic statistics.   1.
