The ever-changing Air and Space Expeditionary Force (AEF) environment requires vision, preparation, and attention to ensure people have the right skills and tools to deliver the capabilities and the support required by the war fighter in meeting the Air Force (AF) mission of today and vision of the future.  Declining resources, expanding mission diversity, and new technologies in the AF are impacting the readiness of our most valuable resource—people.  These factors will continue to exist in the future, making it essential for the workforce to be effectively and efficiently trained to perform duties within each skill level of an Air Force Specialty (AFS).  To meet the challenges of tomorrow, the AF must place a greater emphasis on career field training today.   2. This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive education and training document that identifies life-cycle education and training requirements, training support resources, and minimum core task requirements for the deliberate development of the 4E0X1 Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC).  The CFETP will provide Public Health (PH) personnel with a clear career path to success.  NOTE: Civilians occupying associated positions will use Part II to support duty-position qualification training.  3. The CFETP consists of two parts.  Supervisors use both parts to plan, manage, and control 4E0X1 training.  3.1. Part I provides information necessary for overall specialty management.  3.1.1. Section A explains how everyone will use this plan.  3.1.2. Section B identifies career field progression information, duties, responsibilities, training strategies, and provides a developmental pathway.  3.1.3. Section C associates each skill level with the specialty qualifications for knowledge, education, training, and experience.  3.1.4. Section D indicates resource constraints.  3.1.5. Section E is used if two or more specialties are merging.  Outline the specialty requirements to satisfy transition training needs.   3.2. Part II provides a comprehensive list of training courses and standards available to support career  field training requirements.  There are six sections to Part II:  Specialty Training Standard (STS), Course Objectives List (COL), On-The-Job Training (OJT) Support Material, Training Course Index, MAJCOM-Unique Requirements, and Training Development & Documentation.  3.2.1. Section A contains the most current version of the STS.  This revised STS identifies 3-, 5-, and 7-skill level training requirements and indicates those tasks determined to be "core" 4    tasks.  The STS also includes duties, tasks, technical references, United States Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine (USAFSAM) conducted training, wartime emergency "surge" training curriculum, and correspondence course requirements.  3.2.1.1. The 3-skill level column lists the topics and proficiency levels to which entry-level students are trained in the Public Health Apprentice Course.  3.2.1.2. The 3-skill level column should be used by supervisors to conduct course graduate evaluations in accordance with AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program.  3.2.2. Section B contains the COL.  Supervisors use this list to determine the scope of training Airmen receive from these courses.  3.2.3. Section C identifies available training support materials.  3.2.4. Section D contains the Training Course Index, listing mandatory "in-residence" courses, field training, education, logistics, and communications courses, and exportable courses used to support training within the 4E career field.  Supervisors use this index to determine resources available to support  training.  Both mandatory and optional courses are listed here.  3.2.5. Section E identifies any MAJCOM-unique requirements, if any.  3.2.6. Section F is specific to medical AFSCs.  It describes the master training plan and training documentation.  3.3. At unit level, supervisors and trainers use Part II to identify, plan, and conduct training in line with the overall goals of this CFETP.  4. Use of the guidance provided in this CFETP provides the foundation for effective and efficient training of individuals in the 4E0X1 career field at the appropriate points in their career.  5    ABBREVIATIONS/TERMS EXPLAINED  Advanced Training:  Formal course which provides individuals who are qualified in one or more  positions of their Air Force Specialty (AFS) with additional skills/knowledge to enhance their expertise in the career field.

Purpose of the CFETP:  This CFETP provides information necessary for the PH CFM, PH MFMs, USAFSAM, commanders, training managers, supervisors, and trainers to plan, develop, manage, and conduct an effective career field training program.  This plan outlines the training that individuals in the 4E0X1 AFSC will receive to develop and progress in the 4E career field.  This plan identifies initial skills, upgrade, qualification, advanced, and proficiency training. 1.1. Initial skills’ training, conducted at USAFSAM, is the AFSC-specific training an individual receives upon entry into the 4E career field.  Course graduates are awarded the 3-skill level. 1.2. Upgrade training identifies the mandatory courses, task-qualification requirements, Career Development Course (CDC) completion, correspondence course completion, core and duty tasks, retraining of duties, and minimum experience required for award of the 5-, 7-, and 9-skill levels. 1.3. Qualification training is actual "hands on" task performance training designed to qualify an airman in a specific duty position.  This training occurs both during and after the upgrade training process. It is designed to provide the knowledge, skill, ability, and confidence required to do the job. 1.4. Advanced training is formal specialty training provided to select airmen. 1.5. Proficiency training is additional training either through in-residence, exportable, or on-the-job provided to increase an airman's skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required for upgrade. 2. Uses of the CFETP:  The plan will be used by PH MFMs and supervisors of 4E Airmen at all levels  to ensure comprehensive and cohesive specialty training. 2.1. USAFSAM PH staff develop and revise formal resident, nonresident, field and exportable training  based on requirements established during U&TWs and other curriculum reviews.  They also work with the PH CFM to develop acquisition strategies to obtain resources needed to provide the identified  training. 2.2. PH MFMs will ensure MAJCOM-unique training programs complement 4E CFETP requirements. 2.3. Each 4E Airman will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan for their respective upgrade training. 2.4. Scope of Practice/Responsibility:  Total force PH enlisted personnel may be asked to perform tasks beyond their normal training and scope of practice and responsibility.  Scope of practice and responsibility is outlined in terms of this CFETP and is defined as the range of 11         subject knowledge, task knowledge, and task performance that PH personnel apply in the performance of duty at the appropriate skill level.  2.4.1. When the Medical Group (MDG) leadership team validates requirements to utilize 4E0X1 Airman to perform tasks not listed in the 4E CFETP (clinical or non-clinical), the organization must request approval for scope of practice/responsibility waiver.  Scope of practice/responsibility waivers, in this context, should not be confused with utilization of human capital for Unit/CC approved and validated short-term manpower support to efforts commonly referred to as ‘details’ or projects.  In accordance with AFI 36-2101, “Commander and Supervisor shall:  Assign personnel to authorized positions consistent with requirements, Airman’s grade, and skill/qualification level”.  Procedures to request a scope of practice/responsibility waiver are outlined in AFI 44-119, Medical Quality Operations, and also highlighted in the following paragraphs 2.4.2. – 2.4.4.:  2.4.2. The utilization of total force 4E0X1 technicians for extended scope of practice must meet three (3) criteria: 2.4.2.1. The expanded scope of practice/responsibility of the task must be mission essential.  2.4.2.2. The member must be trained and certified for the expanded scope by a competent and certified trainer and the training must be documented.  Training requirements must meet the standards established in AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program. 2.4.2.3. The expanded role is restricted solely to military mission performance and it requires annual review and approval.  2.4.3. The AFCFM is the final waiver authority for enlisted scope of practice/responsibility waivers.  Contact the AFCFM prior to formal coordination to ensure the chain of command is aware of AF-wide mission and resources needs and changes.  When requesting the scope of practice/responsibility waivers for 4E0X1, the enlisted waiver routing process is as follows: 2.4.3.1. Scope of practice/responsibility waivers are required to authorize the use of 4E0X1 personnel outside of 4E CFETP tasks.  For example, routing should be approved through 1.) MTF PH Officer; 2.) MTF/CC; 3.) MAJCOM PH FM or Officer; 4.) 4E0X1 CFM for concurrence or non-concurrence.  2.4.4. Waiver requests will include the following:  2.4.4.1. Rationale for expanding practice to include human capital and location/host MTF. 2.4.4.2. Specific task(s) to be added.  2.4.4.3. Task checklist/algorithm.   2.4.4.4. Training plan, protocol(s), and references.   12         2.4.4.5. Procedures for competency validation/certification/periodic certification.  2.4.4.6. Plan for obtaining and sustaining competency for expanded practice. 2.4.4.7. All waiver requests must be resubmitted annually for re-verification and approval.  2.4.5. In all cases, training and periodic requirement, knowledge and skill certifications are formally certified on AF IMT 797, Job Qualification Standard Continuation/Command JQS or AF IMT 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training, and maintained in the individual’s electronic Air Force Training Record (AFTR).  Training references for all tasks beyond any individual’s scope of practice/responsibility or the CFETP will be maintained in the duty section where these tasks are performed.   2.5. Use Outside of CAFSC:  The Military Personnel Section may authorize using Airman through Senior Master Sergeant (SMSgt) outside their Control AFSC (CAFSC).  However, to negate any career regression, the basis for an airman’s prolonged assignment outside of the normal career progression pattern must be limited and rotational.  Reference AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted) for guidance on the amount of time that a member can be utilized.  2.5.1. Members with a Selective Reenlistment Bonus (SRB) must request a waiver through the Military Personnel Section (MPS) prior to performing duties outside of their CAFSC in accordance with (IAW) AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted).  Reference AFI 36-2606, Reenlistment in the United States Air Force for guidance on the amount of time that a member can be utilized.  (Note: This does not apply to deployment taskings).  2.5.2. Reference AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted) for guidance on the amount of time that a member without a SRB can be utilized and waiver requirements.  3. Coordination and Approval of CFETP:  The AFCFM is the approval authority for this CFETP.  4E MFMs and USAFSAM PH staff will identify and coordinate career field training requirements.  The Superintendent Public Health Education Division will coordinate with the 4E CFM and 4E MFMs as needed to complete an annual review of the 4E CFETP to assure document currency and accuracy.

Journeyman (5-Skill) Level:  For award of the 5-skill level, 4E Airmen must (1) complete a minimum of 12 months OJT (9 months for retrainees), (2) complete the 4E051 CDC’s and pass end of course test, (3) be signed off on  all STS specified "core" tasks and duty tasks, and (4) be recommended by their supervisor before upgrade to the 5-skill  level.  Once upgraded to the 5-skill level, a journeyman will enter into continuation training.  4E051s are typically assigned duties of increased responsibility such as program manager, food safety and facility inspector, communicable disease interviewer, and instructor.  PH Journeyman-level Airmen are also fully qualified for deployment service.  Most 4E051s will attend Airman Leadership School (ALS) 15   within the 3-6 year time-in-service window (for specifics, see AFI 36-2301, Developmental Education).  Following completion of ALS, 5-skill levels will be considered for appointment as supervisors and, rank permitting, element-level Noncommissioned Officer in Charge  (NCOIC).  4E051s should complete their CCAF in Public Health Technology.  2.3. Craftsman (7-Skill) Level:  Individuals must be an SSgt select or above to enter 7-skill level upgrade training.  They must complete a minimum of 12 months (6 months for retrainees who currently or previously held a 7-skill level)  OJT and a combination of formal and distance learning courses (see Table 1, Mandatory 7-skill level Training Requirements). The Center for Disease Control and Prevention Epidemiology distance learning course must be completed at any time following award of the 5-skill level.  A 4E071 can expect to fill various supervisory and management positions such as NCOIC of a flight or element.  They may also be assigned to higher headquarters staff positions or as a technical training instructor.  Additionally, they can expect career broadening experiences beyond the 4E career field (i.e. USAFSAM, PME instructor, first sergeant, recruiter, etc.).  Increasing PH management experience, deployment service, and additional duty at squadron level are strongly recommended for senior noncommissioned officer (SNCO) promotion.  Continued education leading to award of a PH- related bachelor's degree (i.e. Air University Associate-to-Baccalaureate Cooperative degree program) is highly encouraged.  Table 1.  Minimum Requirements for 7-Skill Level Upgrade: • Complete in residence Operational Entomology Course • Complete minimum 12 months upgrade training (minimum 6 months for retrainees who currently or  previously held a 7-skill level) •  All core tasks and duty tasks signed off •  Complete Center for Disease Control and Prevention Epidemiology Distance Learning Course •  Receive supervisor and training manager recommendation •  Current Hearing Conservation Certification  2.4. Decertification at 3-, 5-, or 7-skill level can occur if Hearing Conservation Certification or any required requirements are not maintained.  See Part II, Section F, 1.2.5. for details on decertification and recertification.  2.5. Superintendent (9-Skill) Level:  AFSC 4E091 will be awarded upon promotion to SMSgt, and after satisfying the requirements of AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted).  A 4E091 can be expected to fill positions such as MAJCOM PH Functional Manager, Superintendent, Public Health Flight and may include additional duty as a squadron superintendent (SQ/CCC).  Additional training in the areas of budget, manpower, resources, and personnel management should be pursued through continuing education.  Higher education, deployment experience, and greater responsibility within the medical treatment facility and in the host unit, base, or community are all expectations of SNCOs.     16  3. Duty Titles:  Duty titles for personnel working in this specialty are governed by AFI 36-2618, The Enlisted Force Structure, and based on rank, skill level, and actual duty position as specified on the Unit Manning Document (UMD).  Enlisted personnel will have a duty title that most accurately reflects their day-to-day duties (i.e. Public Health Technician, NCOIC, Occupational Health, and Flight Chief, Public Health).  When published, duty titles specified in functional directives will be utilized.  3.1. Authorized Duty Titles:  Authorized duty titles shall not be confused with additional duties such as ‘program monitor’ or ‘program manager’.  Appointed additional duties and responsibilities are subordinate to the day-to-day duties and PH operational execution requirements for which the position is authorized, funded, and filled.  Those additional duty appointments are expected to follow a standard developmental building block approach detailed in this CFETP.  PH personnel must focus their attention on achieving competence demonstrated through performance throughout the continuum of learning (CoL) (i.e. education, training, and experience); focus on this CFETP expressed minimum CoL requirements rather than focusing on the duty title.  As such, and when properly utilized/applied, the following duty titles provide clear understanding of the institutional and occupational experience needed for career progression and succession counseling, mentoring, developmental education, and duty vectoring for future duty assignments by all parties concerned (individual, supervisor, CCs).  Additional transparency is gained because the entire 4E0X1 career field is aligned to a common operating practice that meets the people and mission resourcing needs and prepares more than one qualified and eligible candidate for developmental opportunities.  3.1.1. Personnel in the 4E0X1 AFS are restricted to one (1) duty title; instances where personnel hold two (2) significant duties (i.e. NCOIC, Community Health/Force Health Management, etc.), the duty title reflected should be the ‘primary’ position (i.e. where more than 50% of the member’s time is spent performing).   3.1.2. The authorized enlisted duty titles for 4E0X1s performing specific functional requirements and their explanations are as follows:  3.1.2.1. Technician:  Limited instances when a person’s position or duties do not meet the criteria listed below.  In such circumstances, enlisted personnel will have a duty title that most accurately reflects their day-to-day duties (for example Public Health Technician).  3.1.2.2. Supervisor:  Used for junior enlisted Airmen and NCOs who are first line supervisors.  Junior enlisted Airmen will not have the duty title “Supervisor” unless they are at least a SrA, an ALS graduate, and supervise the work of others.  3.1.3. NCOIC:  Use of the NCOIC title must be strictly limited.  The NCOIC title is reserved exclusively for NCOs and SNCOs in charge of a work center or element.  In the PH career field, the authorized NCOIC duty titles are determined by the individual’s designated duty position of responsibility and are as follows.  NOTE:  The Assistant NCOIC title is not authorized for use.  3.1.3.1. NCOIC, Public Health.  An instance where a NCO/SNCO is responsible for managing the Public Health Flight the title, NCOIC, Public Health Flight, is appropriate.  17   3.1.4. Section Chief.  Used for NCOs and SNCOs in charge of a section with at least two subordinate work centers or elements.  3.1.5. Flight Chief, Public Health.  An instance where a SNCO is responsible for managing the PH Flight, the title, Flight Chief, Public Health, is appropriate.  3.1.6. Superintendent, Public Health.  The title Superintendent is strictly limited for use by SMSgts/4E091s.  Typically, Superintendent/4E091s serve at the larger operational flights/MTFs and/or at the AF Materiel Command (AFMC) Air Logistics Centers.  Superintendent/4E091s are expected to fill the role of Unit CC appointed 4E0X1 FM for the MTF.  Exception:  MSgts who fill a 4E091 position based on the UMD may use the title Superintendent.  MSgts and below filling validated MSgt and below positions will NOT use the title Superintendent.  3.1.7. Squadron Superintendent, (i.e.18th) Aerospace Medicine Squadron.  Used by SNCOs who are the SEL of a squadron (i.e. Squadron Superintendent, 18th Aerospace Medicine Squadron).  Only SNCOs will hold the duty title of Squadron Superintendent.  3.1.8. Manager, Public Health.  SNCOs appointed as MFMs may use the title Manager, Public Health as the 4E MFM.  Manager positions are considered KDPs in the PH Functional Advisory Council for Enlisted Development Teams (eDT) and limited to the following UMD authorizations.  3.1.9. Chief Master Sergeants (CMSgts):  There are five 4E000 CMSgt positions authorized:  (1) HQ AFMSA (DHHQ), Falls Church, VA; (2) USAFSAM, (3) HQ ACC, JB Langley-Eustis, VA; (4) 559 MDG, JB San Antonio-Lackland, TX; and (5) 779 AMDS, JB Andrews, MD.  3.1.9.1. Chief positions at 779 AMDS, JB Andrews, MD and 559 MDG, JB San Antonio-Lackland, TX are earned positions and members must have a primary duty title of Superintendent, Public Health. If assigned additional duties then that duty is secondary in the duty title (i.e. Superintendent, Public Health/Squadron Superintendent).   3.1.10. Manager, Public Health Flight.  CMSgt 4E000s may use the title, Manager, [FILL IN] Flight.  A SMSgt/4E000 assigned to a CMSgt billet may also use this Manager title.  Although authorized, this duty title is rarely used.  4. Training Decisions:  The training decisions for the 4E0X1 career field were made during the 5-8 May 2015, Utilization & Training Workshop (U&TW).  The CFETP uses a building block approach (simple to complex) to encompass the entire spectrum of training requirements for the 4E0X1 career field.  The spectrum includes a strategy for when, where, and how to meet the training requirements.  The strategy must be apparent and affordable to reduce duplication of training and eliminate a disjointed approach to training.   4.1. Initial Skills training (3) Skill Level:  There were multiple proficiency code changes.  4.2. Five (5) Skill Level: The 4E051 CDC will be revised and updated to meet new training  18    requirements, and update new technology and regulatory information.  Completion of CDCs is mandatory before member is eligible  for upgrade to the 5-skill level.  4.3. Seven (7) Skill Level: Members of the May 2015 U&TW streamlined the mandatory upgrade training requirements.  Additionally, the proficiency codes for many 7-skill level tasks were adjusted based on results from the Occupational Job Analysis and recommendations from SMEs.   5. Community College of the Air Force:  Enrollment in the CCAF occurs upon completion of basic military training.  CCAF provides the opportunity to obtain an Associate in Applied Science degree.  In addition to its associate degree program, the CCAF offers the following:  5.1. CCAF Instructor Certification (CIC) Program:  CCAF offers the CIC program for qualified active instructors who teach CCAF collegiate-level courses at a CCAF-affiliated school.  The purpose of the certification is to recognize the instructor's extensive faculty development training, education and qualification required to teach a CCAF course and formally acknowledges the instructor's practical  teaching experience.  5.2. CCAF ISD Certification Program:  CCAF offers the ISD Certification Program for active qualified individuals who develop and/or manage CCAF courses or curriculum at CCAF affiliated schools.  The  purpose of the certification is to recognize the training and education required for individuals to be qualified to develop and manage CCAF collegiate courses.  The certification also recognizes the individual's ISD qualifications and experience in planning, developing, implementing, and managing instructional systems.  Qualified officer, enlisted, civilian, and other service curriculum writers and managers are eligible for this certification.  5.3. AF COOL Program:  Credentialing has two purposes.  First, it continues to professionalize the enlisted force by providing up-to-date industry-recognized credentials in an airman’s AF job.  Second, it provides a way for airmen to prepare for civilian life by ensuring that they are ready for work in the civilian sector.  There are many aspects to credentialing including certifications and licenses.  In addition, there are a variety of agencies that provides credentialing. Some are at the National level while others are State or industry driven.  Additional information on AF COOL can be found on the Air Force Virtual Education Center website.  5.4. Professional Manager Certification (PMC):  CCAF offers the PMC for qualified senior Air Force enlisted personnel who have demonstrated an advanced level of professional accomplishment.  The purpose of the certification is to recognize the individual’s outstanding education and training required to lead and manage Air Force personnel and critical national defense assets.  The certification also formally acknowledges the individuals management qualifications and experience.  Qualified Air Force enlisted personnel are eligible for this certification.  Additional information on PMC can be found on the Air University website @ http://www.au.af.mil/au/barnes/ccaf/certifications.asp.  6.  Degree Requirements:  All airmen are automatically entered into the CCAF program.  Public Health degree program requirements are shown in Table 3.

The Language Enabled Airman Program (LEAP).  The LEAP is a career-spanning program to sustain, enhance and utilize the existing language skills of all Airmen.  The objective of LEAP is cross-culturally competent leaders across all AF specialties with working level foreign language proficiency – leaders that can meet AF global mission requirements.  LEAP is a volunteer program open to officers and enlisted Airmen in most AFSCs.  To become a participant in LEAP, Airmen must already possess moderate to high levels of proficiency in a foreign language specified on the AF Strategic Language List.  LEAP is managed by the Air Force Culture and Language Center, part of AU’s Spaatz Center at Maxwell AFB, AL.  For more information, visit http://culture.af.mil/leap/index.aspx   6.5. International Health Specialist (IHS).  Teaming with the IHS professionals fits well with the PH occupation.  The IHS experience strengthens individual institutional competencies, PH occupational competencies and makes both the unit and individual a global asset that may be leveraged when needed.  PH craftsman who possess the highest level of demonstrated proficiency and mastery of the occupational and institutionally- valued competencies, and who possess foreign language and cultural communication skills make excellent candidates to support this diverse and challenging global health engagement opportunity.  The IHS works closely with U.S. embassy personnel to coordinate U.S. military support, interagency HADR and health care infrastructure development.  Additional opportunities exist to broaden experiences through the IHS professional program through the defense attaché, courier, and embassy SDI positions.  6.6. Air Force Virtual Education Center (AFVEC).  Airmen may access multiple CCAF self-service options via the AFVEC application on the AF Portal or via the AU CCAF website at http://www.au.af.mil/au/ccaf/catalog/2008cat/deg_req_two.htm or refer to the CCAF General Catalog for specific degree requirements.  7.

MyVector.  MyVector provides a clear picture of the PH enlisted career field and the key developmental and leadership building opportunities within it such as:  core PH functional developmental areas, key PH roles, KLPs/KDPs, and opportunities for progressive movement in the career field and the USAF.  Using MyVector, in conjunction with the CFETP and other support tools/resources, empowers the PH enlisted force to identify with current functional roles and/or current institutional roles.  Additionally, using the MyVector helps Airmen understand how their role fits in the AF, the AFMS, and the career field force development pathway.  MyVector assists Airmen with establishing individual career readiness goals by helping them understand where they are now versus where they want to be in the future.  7.1.1. MyVector may be used for a variety of purposes.  For individual use, these five key steps are suggested as a starting point:  7.1.1.1. Identify current role on MyVector and how role fits in the AF, AFMS, and PH function.   25  7.1.1.2. Investigate career options and career goals.  7.1.1.3. Identify ultimate career goals, career path, and the knowledge, skills and abilities required to achieve goals.  7.1.1.4. Identify opportunities for development which will provide for career progression.  7.1.1.5. Identify opportunities for development, professional or otherwise.  7.2. MyVector may be accessed on the AF Portal: https://afvec.langley.af.mil/myvector    7.3. Mentorship.  Mentorship is a critical component of the AF's Force Development construct.  Mentorship is normally a relationship in which a person with greater experience and wisdom guides another person to develop both personally and professionally and is designed to prepare Airmen for increased responsibilities.   7.3.1. Mentoring Benefits:  There are several benefits to a mentoring relationship, to include receiving further professional career development, enhancing capacity to translate core values and strategies into productive actions, and increasing mastery of the institutional and occupational competencies.  Enlisted members are encouraged to engage in building and maintaining a productive relationship with a mentor.  A logical choice for a mentor is a supervisor.  While the immediate supervisor should be a logical choice for a professional mentor, they may not always be the best one.  Should the immediate supervisor not be a good fit, Airmen might instead look for a professional mentor a couple of levels higher up the career ladder.  This person may be a PH enlisted, commissioned officer or civilian, or work in a completely different AFSC.  7.4. Military Life Cycle Transition Assistance Plan (TAP):  The key to a successful transition is career readiness planning, which requires a carefully thought out Individual Transition Plan (ITP) incorporated into the entire span of a service member’s career.  In the past, transition and preparation for the civilian workforce occurred late in a service member’s time in the military – near the point of separation.  Under this new program, these concepts will be incorporated earlier to ensure that the counseling, assessments, and access to resources to build skills or credentials occur at earlier stages of a service member’s military tenure.  The ITP provides a framework to achieve realistic career goals based upon an assessment of personal and family needs as well as unique skills, knowledge, experience, interests and abilities.  Airmen create and maintain their ITP with assistance from supervisors, mentors, and other advisors.  The ITP coincides with the Transition GPS outcome-based curriculum and provides a means to discover and explore individual skills and interests which may lead to potential post-transition career paths.  The ITP helps Airmen identify critical activities associated with transition and will assist through the process of organizing transition into manageable tasks.  The ITP also helps Airmen to establish a timeline for completing all required activities prior to separation – it is a living document and can be modified at any time.  The ITP is the individual Airman specific road map for attaining employment, education, technical training, and entrepreneurial objectives and can help make a successful transition to civilian life.  To develop a successful career ready ITP, consider the following critical elements depicted in Figure 2 in your planning process:   26  Figure 2.  Military Life Cycle TAP with Career Readiness Standards     27  Section C – Skill Level Training Requirements  1. Purpose.  Skill level training requirements in this career field are defined in terms of task and  knowledge requirements.  This section outlines the specialty qualification requirements for each skill level in broad terms and establishes the mandatory requirements for entry, award, and retention of each  skill level.  The specific task and knowledge training requirements are identified in the STS at Part II, Sections A and B of this CFETP.  1.1. Rotational Training:  To ensure maximum training benefits, at all times possible, the public health apprentices will rotate through the various duty areas with regards to their CDCs (i.e. if working on Food Technology and Sanitation Evaluation CDC, trainee would also be working in that area).  Trainees in 5-skill level UGT will stay in each functional area (Force Health Management and Community Health) for a  minimum of 4 months.  Once the 5-skill level is obtained, the Public Health Journeyman will rotate  through each functional area as described in Table 5.  This will ensure each journeyman has the opportunity to master all tasks prior to achieving his/her 7-skill level.  Once the 7-skill level is obtained, the Public Health Craftsman will rotate through each functional area as described in Table 6.  Rotational- based performance ensures stability within each functional area and allows the Craftsman to perfect  his/her craft while providing appropriate training to others in UGT.  1.2. Qualification Training Packages (QTPs):  There are currently 2 volumes of QTPs that consist of 34 modules available for the 4E0X1 career field.  Any additional QTPs will be addressed with MFMs and USAFSAM representatives, and will be identified during periodic updates of this CFETP.  Table 5. Qualification Training Packages Title  Volume Modules QTP 4E0X1-1, Community Health Special Procedures QTP 4E0X1-2, Force Health Management Special Procedures 1 2 18 16  1.3. Proficiency Training:  Any additional knowledge and skill requirements, which were not taught through initial skills or UGT, were assigned to continuation training.  The purpose of the continuation-training program is to provide additional training exceeding the minimum UGT requirements with emphasis on present and future duty positions.  PH supervisors and managers must develop a continuation-training program that ensures individuals in the PH career field receive the necessary training at the appropriate point in their career.  The training program will identify both mandatory and optional training requirements.  Supervisors can use the PH Task Breakdown library, found on the PH CFM Knowledge Exchange site @ https://kx2.afms.mil/kj/kx6/PublicHealthCFM/Pages/home.aspx as a proficiency training resource.  PH supervisors must be familiar with available training courses listed on AETC Education and Training Course Announcements (ETCA), and highly encourage and support attendance of these courses.    28  1.4. Recommended Rotation:  To maximize career broadening opportunities, the following rotation schedule is highly recommended for 4Es working at an MTF.  These are only recommendations and deviations may be required to meet the specific mission requirements of each facility.  Table 6.

In addition, this section includes actions required, office of primary responsibility, and target completion dates.  Resource constraints will be, as a minimum reviewed and updated annually.  There are currently no resource constraints.   2. Reporting Job Proficiency Training Constraints – Units/MAJCOMS. 2.1. Supervisors should report known resource constraints that prevent personnel from completing the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan, to their unit EST manager.  The authority for requesting waivers is AFI 36-2101.   2.2. In the waiver, provide a brief description of the resource constraints which adversely affect the training program and include the impact this constraint has or will have on training.  Identify the specific STS line item and core task code (s) affected.  Also provide a brief description of the resource needs to resolve the problem, including expenses, the corrective actions taken or to be taken, and the estimated completion date.  2.3. If the constraint may be resolved at the local level, the report will be coordinated with the senior 4E0X1, and if the impact affects unit war skill requirements, the group CC.  If the constraint needs MAJCOM support, forward the report through your MDG/CC to the 4E0X1 MFM.  Constraints that cannot be resolved at the unit or MAJCOM level, or have a long term estimated completion date, must be forwarded to the 4E0X1 AFCFM as a request for waiver or deferment of CFETP requirements.       35            Section E- Transition Training Guide:  There is currently no transition training requirement.

Measurement.  Each objective is indicated as follows: 1.1. “W” indicates task or subject knowledge, which is measured using a written test. 1.2.  “PC” indicates required task performance, which is measured with a performance progress check. 1.3. “P” indicates required task performance, which is measured with a performance test. 1.4. “PW/C” indicates separate measurement of both knowledge and performance elements using a written test and a performance progress check. 2. Standard.  The standard is 70% on written examinations.  Standards for performance measurement are indicated in the objective and delineated on the individual progress checklist.  Instructor assistance is provided as needed during the progress check, and students may be required to repeat all or part of the behavior until satisfactory performance is attained. 3. Proficiency Level.  Most task performance is taught to the “2b” proficiency level, which means the student can do most parts of the task but does need assistance on the hardest parts of the task (partially proficient).  The student can also determine step-by-step procedures for doing the task. Section C – Support Material 1.

Section E  MAJCOM-Unique Requirements 1.  The Air Reserve Component (ARC) comprised of Air National Guard and Air Force Reserves have a  medical standards and profiles management exception to policy.  Medical standards, profile/duty-limiting conditions/waiver management, and audiometric testing (non-deployable mission requirements) will be retained by the 4N0X1, 4N0X1F or 4A0X1 as decided by the MAJCOM ARC.  The 4E0X1 positions within the ARC are maintained by UTC requirement.  The STS indicates core and non-core tasks applicable to the total force.  Those core/non-core tasks designated with an asterisk (*) 51        are not applicable to the ANG and those with a hashtag (#) are not applicable to AFRES. 2. ARC members called to active duty will receive training for asterisk (*) and hashtag (#) designated tasks as applicable. 2.1. Prior to performing audiometric testing, ARC members must receive initial Hearing Conservation  Certification (HCC) training. USAFSAM will allow ARC 4E0X1s, 4N0X1s or 4A0X1s (or civilian  equivalent) to attend HCC courses (initial or recertification). Section F - Training Development & Documentation (Medical Specific) 1. Work Center Training Plan.  The purpose of this section is to provide guidelines and examples of proper documentation for the many electronic forms used in training of all enlisted medical personnel. Training documentation helps to assess readiness capability, individual strengths and weaknesses.  It also aids compliance with all Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care, The Joint Commission,  and Health Services Inspections regulatory requirements.  The enlisted training documentation has migrated from the hard copy to electronic AFTR.  AFTR is accessible from the ADLS via the AF Portal.  Refer to your unit training manager for the most current policies and guidance on training documentation.  1.1. Master Training Plan (MTP) 1.1.1. A MTP is a reference guide developed for each section that includes all facets of training for individuals assigned.  It is used as a reference source for the type of training and training documentation that occurs with each assigned member.  The MTP is used to standardize training and provide trainers, trainees, supervisors, and NCOICs an overview of the training process for the duty section.  Training managers will incorporate the MTP into AFTR. 1.1.2. The MTP is an overview of training for the duty section, and should include all information involved in the training process for the duty section.  Training will vary from section to section and person to person; however, certain documents will be a standard requirement for all MTPs.  They are listed below: 1.1.2.1. Master task list (MTL).  The MTL identifies all day-to-day mission (duty position) requirements, core tasks, local and contingency tasks, and additional duties performed by work center personnel. 1.1.2.2. Current CFETP or AFJQS (if available). 1.1.2.3. Locally developed AF Form 797, which is now accessible in AFTR. 1.1.2.4. Milestones for tasks and CDC completion (identify the projected time frame the trainee will complete their core tasks and each set of CDCs as required). 1.1.2.5. Unit-Specific Orientation Checklist 1.1.2.6. Job descriptions/performance standards  1.1.2.7. QTPs required to perform peacetime/wartime duties.  Recommendation:  Each MTP should have an official memorandum from the work-center supervisor addressing key issues particular to the work center, and implementation of the MTP.   52     1.2. AFTR 1.2.1. AFTR serves as the single, automated repository for all medical enlisted specialty training. Consult the most current AFTR training message for detailed instructions regarding automated training documentation requirements. 1.2.2. Documentation.  Use the automated AFTR to document all technician qualifications.  NOTE:  An AFJQS may be used in lieu of Part II of the CFETP only upon approval of the AFCFM.  The AFCFM may supplement these minimum documentation procedures as needed or deemed necessary for their career field. 1.2.3. USAFSAM will initiate an AFTR records upon enrollment of all students into the Public Health Apprentice Course.  Students and staff will review and sign entries when required.  Additionally, USAFSAM will upload training progress documentation and, upon graduation, forward the AFTR record to the gaining base. 1.2.4. Decertification and Recertification.  The AFCFM-directed special task certification requirements are designated core tasks from the STS and/or foundational to individual competencies needed in support of UTC METs.  When a supervisor determines an Airman is unqualified on a task previously certified for in their duty position, the supervisor deletes certification when using the automated AFTR system.  Appropriate remarks pertaining to the reason for decertification are entered on the AF Form 623A, On-The-Job Training Record Continuation Sheet, or automated version.  Begin recertification (if required) following procedures in AFI 36-2201, paragraphs 6.9.6.4 and 6.9.6.1.3.  Taking a proactive approach, with all parties’ engaged in the AF Training Program, training managers and supervisors should support proper staff development and training needs before a 3rd Party Certification is scheduled to occur.  Doing this may assist in avoiding unnecessary decertification and may continue to boost the confidence and willingness in members’ competencies to expand to greater challenges.  53
