This  Directive will  assist in the timely  publication of the Air  Force  Program Objective Memorandum (POM) and the President’s Budget (PB),  and applies to all personnel involved in the acquisition or use of Air Force resources.  The process by which DoD conducts strategic planning, program development, resource determination and execution analysis is known as the Planning,  Programming,  Budgeting,  and  Execution  (PPBE)  process.    Use  this  Directive  in conjunction  with  Department  of  Defense  (DoD)  Instruction  5000.02,  Operation  of  the  Defense Acquisition  System,  December  8,  2008,  AFPD  10-9,  Lead  Command  Designation  and Responsibilities  for  Weapons  Systems,  8  March  2007,  and  AFPD  90-11,  Strategic  Planning Systems, 26 March 2009. 2.  Responsible  resource  allocation  serves  as  the  foundation  for  all  successful  Air  Force (AF) activities.  The AF allocation process must be compatible with the Department of Defense (DoD) methodology and processes, orderly, and designed to achieve the highest capability with available assets.   The Air Force must accurately determine requirements, successfully integrate all  activities  competing  for  limited  fiscal  resources,  and  support  DoD  strategy  to  achieve  the greatest Air Force and overall military capability. 3.  The PPBE process is a cyclic process containing four distinct, but inter-related phases: 3.1.  Planning  identifies  capability  requirements  through  planning  and  programming guidance. 3.2.  Programming creates the AF portion of DoD’s Future Years Defense Program (FYDP). 3.3.  Budgeting formulates and controls resource allocation and use. 3.4.  Execution evaluates spending to determine the extent desired capabilities are achieved. 4.  The  Office  of  the  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  and  Headquarters  Air  Force  are responsible  for  the  administration  and implementation  of  the  Air  Force  PPBE process.  Related and specific responsibilities and instructions are included in AFI 16-501. 5.  Adopted Forms: AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication.  MICHAEL B.
