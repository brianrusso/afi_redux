INTRODUCTIONThe helicopter sling load method of carrying cargo andequipment overcomes many of the obstacles that hinderother modes of movement.  Helicopter sling load opera-tions are used extensively in the ship-to-shore movementof cargo and equipment during amphibious operations,movement of supplies and equipment over the battle-field, vertical replenishment of ships, and firepower em-placement.  The purpose of this chapter is to discusshelicopter employment considerations, request proce-dures, responsibilities, safety, and planning for sling loadmissions.1-2.  EMPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS  a.  Advantages of Sling Load.  The sling load methodof moving cargo and equipment has some advantagesover other methods.  These advantages are:     (1)  The rapid movement of heavy, outsizedequipment, or emergency supplies directly to the user.        (a)  The ability to bypass surface obstacles.        (b)  The rapid relocation of supplies andequipment.(2)  The use of multiple flight routes and landingsites to enhance sustainability and security of groundunits.     (3)  The establishment of multiple landing sites tosupport the maneuvering unit requirements.(4)  Greater movement flexibility for the ground com-mander to accomplish the tactical mission. b.  Limitations of Sling Load.   The sling load methodof Aerial Delivery includes the following drawbacks:     (1)  The weight of the load is restricted to theaircraft’s operating capability.     (2)  Load instability during flight may restrictaircraft airspeed or maneuvering capabilities.     (3)  Adverse weather and darkness (low visibility)may limit sling load operations.     (4)  Atmospheric conditions (pressure, altitude,temperature, and winds) affect the helicopter’s liftcapacity.     (5)  A limited number of helicopters are availablefor sling load missions.     (6)  Landing site surface conditions may restrict he-licopter operation.  Loose debris, dust, and snow aresafety hazards that also limit pilot visibility.     (7)  Landing site size must be increased during thehours of darkness or reduced visibility to allow the pilotmore room to maneuver.1-3.  FACTORS AFFECTING HELICOPTERLIFT PERFORMANCEThe supported unit should coordinate with the aviationunit prior to any sling load mission to determine the ac-curate lifting capability of the helicopter.  Several fac-tors affect how much weight a helicopter can carry.  a.  Altitude.  The helicopter loses rotor efficiency athigher altitudes and requires more power to hover thanat lower altitudes.  This means less capability to lift cargo.1-1FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2A  b.  Temperature.  High air temperature has an ad-verse effect on the power output of helicopter engines.An  increase  in  temperature  decreases  engine  perfor-mance.  This means decreased lift capability.   c.  Humidity.  As the relative humidity increases, thehelicopter’s lift performance decreases.   d.  Wind.  Wind affects helicopter performance byincreasing rotor lift without an increase in engine power.Therefore, less power is required to hover into the windthan when no wind conditions exist; also, with constantpower, the helicopter can hover                                                 into the wind withhigher payloads. This is why wind conditions and direc-tion are important to the performance of the helicopter.1-4.  REQUEST PROCEDURESAerial support request procedures depend on whetherthe request is a preplanned mission or an immediatemission.  a.  Preplanned Missions.   Aerial resupply missionsthat are based on known or projected requirements andare programmed  in advance are preplanned requests.The force commander establishes the amount of timerequired to coordinate preplanned support.  These re-quests are submitted through the S4/G4 logistical chan-nels.  Once validated, the request is passed by the S3/G3to the aviation operations.  b.  Immediate Missions.   Immediate requests are forunanticipated, urgent, or priority missions.  In order toreduce delays, immediate requests are submitted throughthe S3/G3 operational channels to aviation operations.   c.  Request Forms.  Support requests should be pro-cessed using DD Form 1974 (Joint Tactical Airlift Re-quest) or in an appropriate format in accordance withstanding operating procedures (SOP).  Marine Corps mis-sion requests are also submitted to the appropriate com-mand using the Assault Support Request Form.  Thisform may be obtained from each service’s respectiveoperations section.1-5.  RESPONSIBILITIESThere are normally three elements involved in sling load1-2operations: the                        supported unit that requests the mis-sion, the aviation unit that provides the aircraft, and thereceiving unit that receives the cargo.  Sometimes, asduring a unit relocation, the supported and receiving unitare the same.  The responsibilities and functions of eachelement are discussed below.  a.  Supported Unit.  The supported unit is respon-sible for the following sling load applications:     (1)  Landing site selection and control (includingcommunications).  The flight deck is the landing siteduring shipboard operations and will be controlled byship personnel.     (2)  Rigging the cargo using procedures in theappropriate rigging manual.    (3)  Providing qualified inspectors and inspectionforms (Appendix I) to inspect the rigged load.     (4)  Distributing completed copies of the Sling LoadInspection Record prior to the time of the sling load mis-sion according to Appendix I.     (5)  Connecting the rigged load to the aircraft cargohook unless that responsibility has been assigned to an-other unit.     (6)  Verifying the total weight of the load (includingrigging equipment).  The supported unit relays the loadweight along with any other information that may affectthe load’s flight stability to the pilot.WARNINGMake sure you accurately determine and re-port the load’s weight to the aircrew.  Loadsthat you report inaccurately could cause thepilot to lose control of the aircraft.     (7)  Providing instructions, as required, to theaviation unit on the location of the delivery pointlanding site.     (8)  Providing disposition instructions to both theaviation and receiving units for return of cargo slings,A-22 cargo bags, cargo nets, containers, and other rig-FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2Aging equipment.      (9)  Securing and protecting sensitive items ofsupply and equipment.     (10)  Providing communications and terminalguidance during small scale operations.      (11)  Ensuring proper supervision of the sling loadoperation including load rigging.

Appendix A describes hand-and-arm  signals.  (This  paragraph  implements  STANAG3117.)         (b)  Requisitioning, storing, inspecting, andmaintaining all the rigging equipment needed for slingload operations.  Appendix B includes a national stocknumber listing for sling sets, cargo nets, and miscella-neous equipment.(c)  (USA) Designating a safe rendezvous pointaway from the helicopter emergency landing area.        (a)  Establishes liaison with aviation and receiv-ing units.        (b)  Provides slings, nets, and related items forrigging cargo.        (c)  Provides personnel for rigging, hookup, andstaging cargo.        (d)  Provides personnel for organizing landingsite and related duties.  Personnel augmentation fromthe supported unit may be required.        (e)  Provides landing site control.        (f)  Ensures a corpsman and radio operator areavailable at each landing site or that each landing sitehas access to them for immediate support.        (g)  Provides accurate cargo weight informationto pilot.  b.  Aviation Unit.  The aviation unit is responsiblefor:     (1)  Coordinating with the supported and receivingunits and, when required, appointing a liaison officerwho is familiar with sling load operations.      (13)  (USN) Providing a qualified sling load teamthat is aware of the following information:      (2)  Advising the supported unit on the helicoptercapabilities and limitations.         (a)  When afloat, the supported unit provides alllifting and rigging equipment.      (3)  Advising the supported and receiving units onthe suitability of the selected landing site.         (b)  Certain cargo slings may not be available tothe supported unit.  Coordination is required with a ver-tical onboard delivery unit for using 15,000-pound and40,000-pound cargo slings.  A                                               chain link conversionchart for the various sling sets is at Appendix C.      (14)  (USMC) Provides material used for preparingthe cargo such as padding, tape, and rope.      (15)  (USMC) Establishes helicopter support team(HST) as outlined in FMFM 6-21 and FMFM 4-3.  Thefollowing are specific responsibilities of the HST:     (4)  Providing comments or recommendations onoverall operations relative to safety.NOTE: The pilot makes the final decision on whetherthe cargo will be moved.      (5)  Providing assistance, if possible, for recoveryand return of the rigging equipment as required by thesupported unit.     (6)  Arranging for the aircraft to be at the landingsite on schedule.1-3FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2A     (7)  (USMC) Providing the HST with personnel andequipment for the helicopter control element (HCE)during large scale operations or when the HST nucleusis provided by the landing support company.     (8)  (USMC) Providing pathfinders to the helicop-ter assault landing zone contact team, when required.reach pendant, even when insulated lineman gloves areworn.  To avoid the possibility of a ground crewmanbeing shocked by this static charge, a static dischargewand is used to ground the helicopter.  Contact betweenthe  wand  and  cargo  hook  must  be  maintained  untilhookup is completed.  Appendix D contains fabricationinstructions for a field expedient static discharge wand.     (9)  (USCG) Providing cargo slings, nets, and otherrigging equipment as required.NOTE:  A helicopter will generate static electrictywithin 5 seconds after grounding is disconnected.  c.  Receiving Unit.  The receiving unit is responsiblefor:     (1)  Selecting, preparing, and controlling the land-ing site (to include communications).     (2)  Receiving and derigging the load.     (3)  Ensuring proper supervision of the deriggingoperation.     (4)  Coordinating the return of lifting equipmentand support personnel to the supported unit, if required.     (5)  Preparing, coordinating, and inspecting back-loads, such as slings, cargo nets, and A-22 cargo bags,and preparing them for hookup or loading.1-6.  SAFETYIn order to safely conduct sling load operations, eachindividual must be aware of the safety hazards he willface, such as static electricity, rotor wash, and other op-erations involving close proximity to the aircraft.  Thehelicopter crew will conduct the flight in accordancewith applicable service procedures and regulations.  a.  Static Electricity.  In flight, a helicopter generatesand stores a charge of static electricity.  When the heli-copter lands, this charge passes to the ground throughthe helicopter grounding system.  However, in flight,this charge remains stored in the helicopter until a pathis provided to ground.  Static electricity must be dis-charged in all helicopters prior to connecting a cargosling or net to the aircraft’s hook, except when using a1-4WARNINGStatic electricity is dangerous and maycause injury or death.  b.  Rotor Wash.  Rotor wash is the high velocity airmovement under a hovering helicopter.  Large helicop-ters, such as the CH-47 and CH-53, can generate rotorwash in excess of 120 knots.  This strong wind may causeground crew personnel difficulty in walking or standingand its force can move unsecured material.  The greatestrotor wash velocity occurs between 20 and 60 feet out-side the rotor disc and will diminish once the aircraft isover the ground crew.  Before conducting sling load op-erations, brief the ground/deck crew on the rotor washpotential of the helicopter.WARNINGPersonnel working beneath a hovering heli-copter will wear personal protective equip-ment.  Ground personnel who inadvertentlyencounter high velocity rotor wash shoulddrop to a sitting or prone position to keepfrom being injured.1-7.  PLANNING  a.  Purpose of Planning.  A very important part of thesling load mission is prior planning.  Prior planning, alongwith the coordination of plans with the aviation liaisonofficer, is essential for a smooth, safe operation.  Duringthe planning phase, the entire mission is reviewed toinclude aircraft limitations, landing site selection, anditems to be lifted along with their weights.  For example,helicopter lift capacity may change depending on envi-FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2Aronmental conditions.  Consequently, coordination ismade with the aviation unit as to the helicopter’s liftcapacity.  If a particular item of equipment presents aproblem that cannot be resolved, it should be referred tothe operations department/section of the participatingunits or another mode of movemnet considered.Consider the following planning factors:     (1)  Number of ground crew personnel.(2)  Equipment to be moved (for example, weight,size, quantity, and destination).     (3)  Alternate means of movement available.     (4)  Number of aircraft and sorties required.     (5)  Landing site and required delivery time.     (6)  Special lifting devices required.    (3)  The amount of time that the unit has to relo-cate or resupply other units.    (4)  How often the unit will move equipment byhelicopter.  c.  Equipment Requirements.   A complete inventoryof unit equipment should be made to determine quantityof rigging material and number of helicopter sorties re-quired to move the unit.  Rigging procedures for com-mon equipment are found in FM 55-450-4/FMFRP 5-31,  VOL  II/NWP  42-1,  VOL  I/AFR  50-16,  VOL  I/COMDTINST M13482.3 and FM 55-450-5/FMFRP 5-31, VOL III/NWP 42-1, VOL III/AFR 50-16, VOL III/COMDTINST M13482.4 (see Preface).  The unit SOPshould contain rigging and loading plans to assist theground crew and reduce confusion at a time when speedand control are needed.  Army units must requisition therequired number of sling sets and cargo nets to moveunit equipment.     (7)  Primary and alternate radio frequencies andquantity of radios required.1-8.  COORDINATION     (8)  Ground crew and aircraft emergency proce-dures.     (9)  Review of maps, landing site description, andlocal terrain features.     (10)  Safety hazards.     (11)  Landing site condition and security.  b.  Personnel Requirements.   The number of groundcrew personnel needed for sling load operations dependsprimarily on how the commander plans to accomplishhis mission.  Selected personnel or all unit members canbe trained as ground crew members.  Helicopter supportteams are the primary source of ground support for theMarine Corps, but selected Marine unit members shouldbe trained as ground crew personnel in case the HST isnot available.  Consideration for the number of crewsneeded (including HST) should include:As plans are being finalized, the information is providedto the aviation unit.  The liaison officers from the sup-ported, aviation, and receiving units must agree that themission is supportable prior to execution.1-9.  TRAININGProper training of personnel involved in sling load op-erations is essential in maintaining an adequate levelof proficiency and knowledge, especially in the areas ofsafety, rigging, and sling load inspection.  a.  Training Responsibility.   Unit commanders areresponsible for training their personnel and determining                                                                    involved inthe level of proficiency for those personnelsling load operations.

Communications Security (COMSEC).   Radio se-curity is an important part of ground crew training.  In ahostile area, the safety of both the helicopter and groundcrew is at risk if the enemy determines your position.1-10.  OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENTgram must be implemented to determine safety risks andconsiderations in order to conduct smooth, safe sling loadoperations.  a.  Risk and Accidents.  Risk is defined as an expected/estimated loss, danger or peril, due to or resulting froma hazard.  Risk is expressed in terms of hazard severityand probability; the consequences (loss or injury) of anaccident.  Historically and in general, accidents havetaken a heavy toll of U.S. Army resources.  Current ex-perience indicates that projection of accident losses us-ing relevant historical records, especially for wartimescenario, the impact of equipment/personnel losses andaccident costs will be significantly greater in future op-erations.  These losses are a measurement of loss of com-bat effectiveness and fighting potential of a force.  Adefinite cause to 80 percent of all Army accidents, groundand air, in military and civilian operations, has been de-termined to be by human error.  Material/system failureor inadequate precautions for environmental factors ac-count for additional accidental mishaps.  b.  Risk Management.  Risk management approachreduces losses in both combat and training consistentwith objectives of mission, operation, training, collec-tive/individual tasks employed, and system(s) used bybuilding safety into these activities.  Consequently, riskmanagement is defined as the process of making “high”risk operations safer by eliminating or reducing riskswhile retaining overall mission benefit.  Formal risk man-agement process encompasses the following actions:(1)  Identify the risks in unit mission, collective andindividual tasks, and routine unit activities that point toaccidental potential.(2)  Assess the risk associated with each hazard.  De-velop, review, and assess alternative techniques, prac-tices, procedures, or plans which allow mission accom-plishment while minimizing accidental risk.(3)  Make decisions and develop control measures.Select and implement the techniques, procedures, or planmost likely to eliminate unnecessary accident risks whileaccomplishing the unit mission, collective and individualtasks, or operation in question.Beginning in the planning cycle, a risk management pro-    (4)  Make safety and the use of risk control proce-1-6FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2Adures standard practice by executing the following acts:(a)  Stress the ties between leadership responsibili-ties/awareness and safety.  Each member of the chain ofcommand must keep in mind that the overall purpose ofunit safety is to keep soldiers free from injury.(b)  Embed risk control measures in unit SOPs, train-ing, job aids, etc..(c)  Conduct all training to standard.  Safe perfor-mance is a result of training to standard.  Failure to trainto standard or to enforce standards is the cause of manyhuman-error-related accidents.(d)  Supervise.  All leaders in the chain of commanddown to the individual soldier responsibility are to ad-vise on safety matters which may effect soldiers andequipment in accomplishing the mission.  Use the “ToughCaring” approach to safety enforcement by incorporat-ing safety and risk control techniques into After ActionReviews and, then, incorporate any safety lessons learnedinto SOPs, training, and future operations.  c.  Risk Management for Sling Load Operations .There are numerous hazards and the potential for acci-dents inherent to sling load operations and proceduresfor conducting those operations.  For example, the riskof static discharge increases when the operating distancebetween the aircraft and the sling load is extremely small.As a risk-reducing control measure, the use of a reachpendant (instead of a static discharge wand) would in-crease the safety margin, assist in ease of hook-up (de-creasing the time the aircraft and hook-up crew are close),and decrease the number of personnel required for hook-up.1-7FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2ACHAPTER 2AIRCRAFT CARGO HOOK SYSTEMS2-1.  INTRODUCTIONHelicopters rapidly move troops and supplies where theyare needed.  They can aerial deliver cargo inside theaircraft or below the aircraft suspended from the cargohook.  This chapter covers capabilities, limitations, andcharacteristics of the utility and cargo helicopters thatare capable of sling load operations.2-2.  DEFINING CARGO HOOK SYSTEMSCargo hooks are attached to the bottom of the aircraftand are opened manually and/or electrically by the air-crew or, in an emergency, manually by the ground crew.During hookup, the cargo sling or cargo net apex fitting/web ring is attached directly to the cargo hook.  Thespring-loaded keeper prevents the apex fitting/web ringfrom slipping off the load beam/cargo hook.  Descrip-tions of the types of hookups are as follows:  •  Single-point rigged loads are connected to a cargohook on the bottom of the helicopter.  •  Normally, dual-point loads are connected to the for-ward and aft cargo hooks.  •  Multiple-point loads are connected to three ormore attachment points or cargo hooks.2-3.  CARGO HOOK CROSS DESIGNATIONNatick Research, Development, and Engineering Cen-ter (NRDEC) has indicated that any single point slingload certified under a specific aircraft is also certifiedfor any aircraft with suitable lift capability.This certification is limited to single-pointCAUTIONloads only.  a.  Lifting Capability.   The load must be within thelifting capability of the desired helicopter model and notexceed the rated capacity of the sling set being used.  b.  Rigging Procedure.  The load shall be rigged inaccordance with the certified rigging procedure.  c.  Airspeed.   The recommended stable airspeed isspecified for the load in the applicability section of therigging procedure.WARNINGWhen working below a helicopter, do not exitto the rear of the aircraft because the tailrotor or tail boom may descend low enoughto strike personnel causing injury or death.2-4. HELICOPTER PENDANT SYSTEMS (USMC,USN)The cargo sling or net apex fitting can be connected di-rectly to the cargo hook or to a releasable swivel hookpendant sling assembly, commonly called a pendant (Fig-ure 2-1).  Pendants provide greater clearance betweenthe helicopter and the load.  Load hookup is faster andthe  added  clearance  provides  more  protection  to  thehookup team.  Some helicopters use pendants that arespecifically                 designed for that aircraft.  Those types ofpendants are discussed in the section dealing with thathelicopter.2-5.  RELEASABLE SWIVEL HOOK PENDANTSLINGThe Marine Corps/Navy AC6000500 Mod-1 pendant isattached to the helicopter cargo hook system and sus-pended under the helicopter.  The swivel prevents theload lifting sling from wrapping up if the load twists.The pendant is 8 feet long and weighs about 53 pounds.2-1FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2A  SAFETY SNAP HOOK  LANYARD "T" HANDLE  LANYARD BREAKAWAY LINK  SLING LEG ASSEMBLY  KEEPER  HOOK (CLOSED POSITION)Figure 2-1.

The aviationunit will provide the pendant.NOTE:  The pendant cargo hook cannot be openedelectrically.  The aircrew opens the hook by pullingon the lanyard inside the aircraft.  The ground crewmust relatch the cargo hook each time the hook isopened.2-6.  HELICOPTER CARGO HOOK SYSTEMSHelicopter cargo hooks have  maximum rated capacitieswhich are shown in this paragraph.  Several factors af-fect a helicopter's lifting capability (see paragraph 1-3).NOTE:  Contact the supporting aviation unit to ob-tain accurate sling load weights for the aircraft beingused.2-2FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2ATable 2-1 identifies the helicopter and its correspondingcargo hook system.  In the cases where the mission sym-bol is not given, the information applies to all the mod-els of that particular helicopter design number.

The AC6000500 pendant can be used with this cargohook(USMC, USN).(2)  The UH-1 does not have an opening in the cabinfloor for the crewman to easily see the cargo hook andmonitor the load.  Therefore, the ground signalman isvery important during the load hookup.

INTRODUCTIONCurrent concepts for our armed forces require a highlymobile logistical support structure to maintain our fast-moving fighting forces.  As such, units will be involvedin  helicopter  support  operations.    Some  units  will  bemoved  while  others  will  be  resupplied  by  helicopters.Ground crew teamwork and proficiency are very impor-tant to the success of a sling load operation.  How wellground crew personnel are trained and how familiar theyare with their equipment may determine the final out-come of the mission.  All units should have an ongoingsling load training program to keep their ground crewscurrent on unit equipment and to train new ground crewpersonnel.  The implementation of a ground crew train-ing program is a command responsibility.  This chapterdiscusses the ground crew, their equipment, and respon-sibilities.3-2.  GROUND CREWGround crew teams are classified by their locations:the hookup team at the supported unit landing site andthe receiving team at the receiving unit landing site.a.  The Hookup Team.   The hookup team consists ofa minimum of either four  (USMC, USN) or three per-sons (USA, USAF, USCG).  The team is made up of thesignalman, static wand person, and the hookup man.  TheUSMC and USN hookup team also has a team supervi-sor as the fourth person.  Aboard ship, the landing signalofficer/enlisted  (LSO/LSE)  will  perform  the  duties  ofthe  signalman.    Additional  hookup  men  are  requiredwhen using dual and multiple-hook aircraft, such as theCH-47D and H-53E.  The H-53E requires a separate staticwand  person  for  each  cargo  hook,  while  the  CH-47Drequires only a single static wand person.b.  The Receiving Team.  The receiving team consistsof a signalman to direct the placement of the load, ahookup man familiar with manual release procedures,and when required, a static wand   person.  The hookupman and static wand   person are necessary if they haveto manually open the cargo hook.c.  The Helicopter Support Team (HST).    Helicop-ter support teams are the primary source of ground sup-port for the Marine Corps, but selected Marine unit mem-bers should be trained as ground crew personnel  in casethe HST is not available.d.  Responsibilities.  Since the unit owning the equip-ment is responsible for properly rigging the equipmentand using correct procedures during the sling load op-eration, the ground crew must be thoroughly trained inthe complete operation.  Ground crew duties include thefollowing:(1)  Clear the landing site.(2)  Rig and derig the loads.(3)  Direct the aircraft over the load for hookupand over the landing point for load release.(4)  Hook up the load to the cargo hook.NOTE:  Large items of equipment may require morethan three people to prepare, rig, and hook them upto the helicopter.  Although each crew member hasspecific  duties  during  the  operation,  each  personshould be trained to perform all duties.e.    Safety  Considerations.    Ground  crew  personnelmust be careful and alert at all times while working nearoperating aircraft because the hazards found in operat-ing under a hovering helicopter are not always apparent.Only trained crews should be used to rig loads and hookthem to the aircraft.  The following safety considerationsare provided to minimize the chances of injury during ahookup operation.  They should be read, practiced, and3-1FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2Aincluded in the unit’s applicable training program.(1)  Avoid flying debris and foreign object damage.(2)  Avoid cargo sling leg entanglement.(3)  Avoid sharp objects protruding from loads or air-craft.(4)  Avoid top-heavy or unbalanced loads.(5)    Avoid  being  caught  between  the  load  and  theaircraft.(6)  Always watch the aircraft and be ready toquickly move out of the way in the event the helicop-ter has an emergency.(7)  Avoid moving and protruding parts of the aircraftsuch        as main rotor blades, tail rotor blades, landinggear, and cargo hooks.(8)  Stay clear of swinging cargo hooks and cargo.(9)  Avoid tripping over static discharge wand ground-ing cable.(10)  Be alert for vehicles without brakes, with faultybrakes, or brakes not engaged.(11)   Be alert for loads with damaged lifting provi-sions.(12)  Take special care on slippery and wet surfaces,pitching decks, and in high winds.(13)  Wear all required safety equipment.(18)  Double check the load for proper rigging andsling attachment.(19)  Do not participate in or allow horseplay.(20)    Know  your  position  in  relation  to  thehelicopter(s)  at  all  times,  especially  during  shipboardoperations.(21)  Watch movement of the aircraft and signals fromthe aircrew in case of an emergency.  Remember, youwill be under it!(22)  Follow established emergency procedures.  Bealert for signals from the signalman in case of an emer-gency.(23)  Make sure brakes or chock blocks are engagedor installed as required.(24)  Keep the area clear of loose equipment whichcould damage the aircraft or injure personnel.(25)  Remain clear of the hookup area unless youare participating.(26)  (USA) Know where the rendezvous point is incase of an emergency.f.  Team Supervisor Safety Considerations.   Theteam supervisor has specific safety related duties.  Hemust perform the following actions:(1)  Inspect sling equipment for serviceability.(2)    Establish  and  maintain  radio  communicationswith the aircrew, if applicable.(14)  Be aware of procedures being performed; knowwhat you are doing.(3)  Appoint a signalman to give hand-and-armsignals to the aircrew.(15)  Use static discharge wand as required.(16)    Be  aware  of  obstacles  on  the  ground  or  deckthat may cause you to fall.(17)  Keep an eye on your fellow crew members; theirsafety is important.(4)  Conduct a safety briefing with the aircrew, ifthe situation permits.(5)  Make sure all ground crew/HST personnel havethe proper protective equipment.(6)  (USMC, USN) Make sure static wand personsand hookup men wear electrician/lineman gloves.3-2FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2A(7)  (USA, USAF, USCG) Make sure hookup menwear leather gloves.(Appendixes E and F have checklists to assist him.)  Toaccomplish coordination, he:(8)  Abort the operation if conditions are present thatwould injure personnel or cause a safety hazard.  Informthe aircrew if time permits.(1)  Coordinates with the supported unit to determinetype  of  mission,  location  of  the  cargo,  and  equipmentrequired to conduct the operation.(9)  Brief ground crew/HST on safety hazards andmake sure that proper safety procedures are followed.(2)  Establishes liaison with the aviation unit to in-clude a preoperation briefing.3-3.  PREPARING FOR THE OPERATIONThe unit commander must provide local security for theoperation (this task is not the responsibility of the groundcrew).  Once the commander has designated the areas tobe used for sling load operations, ground crew person-nel clear the zone and set up markings to identify thearea from the air.a.  Inspection.  Before the operation starts, the groundcrew must make sure that the cargo to be transportedhas been correctly prepared, rigged, and inspected forsling load movement.  All loads must be inspected be-fore rigging.  Give special attention to the lifting points.Bolts and retention pins in lifting shackles must be ser-viceable and properly installed.  Equipment with unau-thorized repairs or improper replacement parts on lift-ing provisions are unsafe to sling load.  Equipment couldbe damaged if it is not prepared and rigged properly.b.  Breakaway Safety Ties.  Breakaway taping is usedto hold lines and sling legs in place before the aircraftarrives in the pickup area.  The tape temporarily holdsthe legs in place and prevents them from entangling or                          projecting items, mirrors, exhaustwrapping aroundstacks,  or  steering  wheels  during  hookup  and  lift-off.When the aircraft puts pressure on the lifting legs, thetape  pulls  off  or  breaks  away  from  the  place  where  itwas taped.3-4.  HOOKUP TEAM RESPONSIBILITIESFor  more  detailed  instructions  for  each  member,  seeChapter 5.  a.  Team Supervisor (USMC/USN Only).   The teamsupervisor is responsible for overall team coordination,equipment, logistic support, communications, and safety.(3)  Organizes and assigns duties to each ground crewmember based on the mission.(4)  Directs and supervises the ground crew in pre-paring and inspecting all HST equipment.(5)  Ensures that ground crew personnel are properlyequipped with individual safety equipment.(6)  Directs and supervises all rigging and deriggingoperations.(7)  Establishes and maintains communications withthe aircraft commander at all times throughout the op-eration.(8)  Organizes the landing site to include avenues ofapproach  and  exit;  establishes  staging  areas  (vehiclesand cargo) and marshaling areas (personnel); and selectslanding points within the landing site.(9)  Supervises all operations within the landing site.b.  Signalman.   For USMC HST operations, the out-side director is referred to in this manual as the signal-man.(1)  The signalman initially identifies the load to belifted and provides hand-and-arm signals to the pilot toposition  the  aircraft  over  the  load.    As  the  helicopterapproaches the load, the signalman moves to a positionapproximately 45 degrees off the nose of the aircraft.(2)  The signalman moves with the aircraft to makesure that the pilot can see the signals.  The signals mustbe precisely given to prevent any misunderstandings be-tween the signalman and the pilot. (Hand-and-arm sig-nals are explained in Appendix A.) The pilot uses an3-3FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2Aaircrew member for primary directions when the aircraftis over the load.  The signalman is used as an additionalreference.  The signalman clears the aircraft for depar-ture  once  the  load  is  off  the  ground.    He  maintains  acontinuous watch for other aircraft entering the landingsite  area  or  vehicles  that  may  affect  the  safety  of  theoperation.c.    Inside  Signalman  (If  Required)  (USMC  HSTAshore Only).   The inside signalman is especially im-portant when conditions make it difficult for the signal-man to see the hookup crew and  load.  The inside sig-nalman assists in properly positioning the aircraft overthe load.  He positions himself to best observe the air-                                                            and uses hand-craft cargo hook in relation to the loadand-arm signals which are relayed by the signalman tothe aircraft crew.d.  Static Wand Person.  The static wand person mustbe thoroughly familiar with the effects of static electric-ity.  He provides the primary protection against severeelectrical shock for the hookup/manual release crew bytouching  the  static  discharge  wand  to  the  cargo  hookand maintaining contact until the hookup/manual releasecrew clears the load.e.  Hookup Man.   The hookup man positions himselfon or near the load in a stable position and attaches thesling or net apex fitting to the cargo hook.  If required,he performs the manual release of the cargo hook.legs become entangled in the load.g.  Additional Personnel.   Any extra personnel, suchas equipment operators, will be positioned so that theyare clear of the maneuver area and away from the land-ing points.  The rendezvous point is a good position forthese additional personnel (USA).3-5.  PERSONNEL BRIEFINGAll personnel involved with the mission should be thor-oughly briefed on their duties and responsibilities.  Thebriefing  should  include,  but  not  be  limited  to,  discus-sion of the following items:  •  Cargo to be carried.  •  Operating area description and peculiarities.  •  Aircraft approach direction, cargo hookup/release,and aircraft departure.  •  Ground/aircrew duties including communications,static grounding, personnel approach/exit procedures, andspecial safety precautions.  •  Procedures to follow in the event of aircraft emer-gency.3-6.  RECEIVING TEAM RESPONSIBILITIESf.  Sling Leg Crew (If Required).   The sling leg crewis used when there is not enough time or equipment topermit breakaway taping or the load has many obstruc-tions which could entangle the sling legs.  The sling legcrew personnel perform the following actions:The receiving team, along with the HST team supervi-sor, is responsible for:  • Locating, clearing, and marking the receiving land-ing site.(1)  Position themselves on or near the load on a stablesurface.  •  Establishing and maintaining required communica-tions.(2)  Hold the sling legs clear of obstructions until theaircraft has lifted enough to apply tension to the slingwhich will remove all slack from each leg.(3)  Exit the area of the load and move to the team’srendezvous point or exit direction.(4)  Stand by to return to the load on the team leader’ssignal, in case the helicopter dips down and the sling  •  Directing and controlling helicopters within the land-ing site.  •  Discharging static electricity if manual release is re-quired.  •  Conducting manual release of the sling from the cargohook, as required.3-4FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2A  •  Derigging delivered cargo.  •  Providing vehicle and personnel ground control.  •  Ensuring recovery of all sling equipment.3-7.  PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENTGround personnel involved in helicopter sling load op-erations are exposed to hazards that could cause seriousinjury.  These hazards include noise, rotor wash, staticelectricity,  flying  debris,  and  operations  around  sus-pended cargo.  Certain items of personal protective equip-ment must be worn to provide for maximum personnelsafety.a.  Head and Neck Protection.   A helmet or cranialprotector is required to provide protection from flyingdebris and other objects.  It also offers some protectionif personnel are struck by the helicopter or cargo hook.The helmet must be securely fastened to ensure that itcannot be blown off or lifted up into the helicopter blades.Appendix  G  has  a  component  listing  for  the  MC-140helmet.b.  Eye and Ear Protection.   A protective mask oreye goggles are required to protect ground crewmen’seyes  and  to  allow  them  to  see  well  enough  to  operateeffectively.  Hearing protection, such as ear plugs, mustbe used to protect ears from noise and the entry of sandor dust.  The MC-140 multiple-purpose helmet providesprotection against all the hazards listed above.  This hel-met also includes a shroud for neck protection.c.  Hand Protection.  Marine Corps/Navy static wandperson/hookup men are required to wear electrical work-ers gloves for static discharge burn protection.  All otherpersonnel  (USA/USAF/USCG)  should  wear  leathergloves to help protect their hands and fingers.  If electri-cal workers gloves are available, all static wand personsshould wear them for added protection from static dis-charge burns.  To ensure adequate protection from staticelectric  shock,  electrical  workers  gloves  must  be  in-spected before and after each operation.  They should bechecked  for  excessive  wear,  fraying,  holes,  and  tears.Do not use a glove that is torn.  Even a small hole leavesa person unprotected from static electric shock.  Glovescan be checked for holes by filling them with water andsqueezing while holding the open end closed.  The glovescan also be checked by blowing air into them like a bal-loon.  Submersion in water will indicate whether thereare leaks.d.  Clothing.   To prevent clothing from flapping orsnagging on cargo, the ground crew will roll their sleevesdown and button their shirts and jackets.  Military-ap-proved combat, flight, or safety boots will be worn dur-ing sling load operations ashore.  During shipboard slingload operations, shoes with rubber heels and soles arerequired.  Personnel should remove watches, rings, andjewelry to prevent them from being caught in the slingset or load.  Army personnel must wear their identifica-tion tags during a sling load operation.NOTE: During a sling load operation with an H-53E,all personnel should wear body armor (flak jacket)because of the amount of debris blown by the rotorwash.e.  Flotation Equipment (Life Vest).   All personnelinvolved in shipboard operations or operations  near watermust wear flotation equipment.f.  Other Equipment.   The static discharge wand isused to protect the hookup man from static electric shock.Smoke  grenades  are  used  to  mark  the  location  of  thelanding site and/or indicate wind direction.  Flashlightswith  wands  are  used  to  give  hand-and-arm  signals  atnight.    Figure  3-1  shows  equipment  that  is  normallyneeded.  The equipment national stock numbers (NSN)are listed in Appendix B.3-8.  DISCHARGING STATIC ELECTRICITYIn flight, the stored static electric energy of any helicop-ter increases with helicopter weight, low humidity, andamount of debris blown by the rotor system (for instance,dust, sand, or snow).  Extremely high static electric dis-charges may also occur when operating in or near thun-derstorms.  When the helicopter touches the ground, thischarge is grounded out.  However, while the helicopteris in flight, this charge remains stored in the aircraft.  Aground crewman provides a path for this charge to fol-low into the ground when he connects the apex fitting tothe cargo hook.  This charge may cause severe electricalburn or injury.3-5FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2A3-6FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2ANOTE:  The static discharge wand is not requiredwhen a reach pendant is used.NOTE:  Qualified medical personnel should be avail-able during sling load operations involving multiplepickups or deliveries.  If medical personnel are notavailable,  a  member  of  the  ground  crew  should  bethoroughly familiar with basic lifesaving procedures.A first-aid kit should be included in the crew’s equip-ment.a.  Static Discharge Wand.   To avoid the possibilityof a static electric shock, ground crewmen use dischargewands (field expedient and manufactured) to ground thecargo hook.  Since these wands connect the helicopterto the ground, the static electric charge is dissipated andthe hookup man will not receive a shock when he con-nects the apex fitting to the cargo hook.  Figure 3-2 showsa manufactured static discharge wand.  This wand maybe ordered through supply procedures.  Appendix D pro-vides instructions, materials list, and a diagram neededto fabricate a field expedient static discharge wand.b.  Manufactured Static Discharge Wand Inspec-tion.  The manufactured grounding wand consists of aninsulated plastic tube with a metal hook on one end andan attached grounding cable and clamp on the other end.A ground rod is also included.  The grounding wand isnot intended to be repaired.  If the wand or first 10 feetof  cable  (closest  to  the  wand  handle)  is  punctured  orcracked, discard the wand.  If either of the black plugson the ends of the wand come out (they are allowed torotate), discard the wand.  Never attach metal fittings tothe wand or cable.  The following maintenance will pre-serve the electrical capability of the wand and cable:(1)  Remove fuel, grease, or oil from wand.  Removesalt water residue or dirt.  Wipe dry.  Contaminants onthe wand may be conductive and allow an electrical dis-charge to travel the outside surface of the wand and reachthe operator.(2)  Store the wand in a dry place out of direct sun-light.  Turn the wand upside down and coil the cablelariat-style into several loops (12-inch diameter).  Withthe last remaining loop, interlace the cable around theloops several times and attach the clamp to the end plug.Hang the wand upright by the wand hook.  Do not attachclamp  jaws  to  the  grounding  cable  because  you  maypuncture the cable insulation.c.  Operating Instructions for All Static DischargeWands.   Inspect static wand to make sure it is in ser-viceable condition.  Select the grounding rod location.The  recommended  location  is  on  the  side  of  the  loadopposite from rendezvous point or ground crew exit di-rection so that the hookup team will not trip over thecable as they depart the load.(1)  Drive the rod into the ground until firmly seated.A minimum of 6 to 8 inches is required in firm ground,24 inches in sandy or loose soil.  Drive the groundingrod in at a 45-degree angle away from the side of theload.  This angle will cause the rod to bend, resulting inFigure 3-2.  Manufactured Static Discharge Wand3-7FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2Aa less severe injury if someone should fall on it.  Con-nect  the  cable  clamp  to  the  vertical  shaft  of  the  stake(Figure 3-3).(2)  When operating on concrete or asphalt surfaces,position loads as close to the edge of the surface as pos-sible so that the grounding rod can be driven into theground.  For shipboard operations, the cable clamp isattached to a deck pad eye or designated grounding point.(3)  Do not hold the discharge wand within 14 to 16inches of the metal hook end.  A strong static charge canjump up to 12 inches.  To be effective, the groundingwand must maintain contact with the cargo hook duringthe hookup operation (Figure 3-4).  If contact is lost, allpersonnel will pull back from the hook until contact isreestablished between the wand and the aircraft’s cargohook.3-9.  (USA) GROUND CREW RENDEZVOUSPOINTThe most dangerous phase of the sling load operationoccurs as the aircraft hovers over the load; therefore, theground crew must clearly understand the emergency exitprocedure.  The first area to identify is the aircraft emer-gency area, because the rendezvous point location is di-rectly  influenced  by  the  aircraft  emergency  area  loca-tion.a.  Aircraft Emergency Area.   In an emergency situ-ation, the pilot will attempt to maneuver the aircraft toan  open  area  that  affords  the  crew  the  best  chance  ofsurvival.  In other words, if the pilot has any control ofthe aircraft, he will not land in an area that has trees,wires, or buildings.  Therefore, try to keep an open areaclear of any loads and designate that area as the aircraftemergency area.  Since the terrain at each landing siteTO DRIVE STAKE:STRIKE WITH HAMMEROR PUSH ON CROSSHANDLE.THIS CONNECTION PROVIDESMAXIMUM HOLDING AND ALLOWSCLAMP TO SWIVEL ABOUT THE STAKE.ALTERNATEPOSITIONCONNECT CLAMP BELOWCROSSHANDLEFigure 3-3.

Hence, you mustdesignate and identify the aircraft emergency area foreach  landing  site  through  prior  coordination  with  theaviation unit.b.  Rendezvous Area.   The NCOIC must identify arendezvous point where his ground crew can assembleafter each hookup or in the event of an emergency.  Therendezvous point should be well away from the aircraftemergency area.  During an emergency, the ground crewCARGO HOOKDISCHARGEWANDELECTRICALLINEMANGLOVESTO GROUNDING STAKEFigure 3-4.  Positioning the Static Discharge Wandon Aircraft's Hookshould be as far away from the aircraft emergency areaas possible.  The rendezvous point is also a good loca-tion for all personnel not involved with the hookup op-eration.  The rendezvous point should be an area that iseasily  identified  (for  instance,  tree,  bunker,  building,vehicle, wooded area) by the ground crew because theymay be disorientated during an emergency.NOTE:  If the wind direction changes from when youinitially positioned the loads in the landing site, youmay have to redesignate the aircraft emergency area                                point because the aircraft ap-and the rendezvousproach direction may change.c.  Coordination.   If at all possible, coordinate boththe  aircraft  emergency  area  and  the  rendezvous  pointwith the aviation liaison officer or helicopter crew be-fore  the  start  of  the  operation.    Helicopter  emergencyprocedures depend on terrain, wind direction, and pilotchoice.  Good prior coordination will prevent the heli-copter and the ground crew from moving in the samedirection.d.  Working Area.   Ground  crew  personnel  shouldmake every effort to work at the side of the load closestto the rendezvous point so that during an emergency theycan clear from under the aircraft without climbing overor moving around the load.  Ground personnel may ormay not be told to clear the aircraft by a crew memberin the event of an emergency.  If the pilot is able, he willrapidly flash the landing light as a visual warning to theground crew to clear the aircraft.  All personnel involvedwith the sling load mission must exercise sound judg-ment and common sense in positioning themselves sothat if the load should be accidentally dragged or lifted,they can move clear immediately to avoid injury.  Fig-ure 3-5 shows a typical layout for a landing site and agood location for the emergency landing area and ren-dezvous point.  The landing site must be policed to pre-vent a flying object hazard.  Any object that can be liftedby the rotor wash could become a missile and cause dam-age to equipment or injury to personnel.3-10.  HAND-AND-ARM SIGNALSThe radio is the initial means of communication and alanding zone control net should be established for slingload operations.  However, the signalman uses hand-and-arm  signals  to  communicate  with  the  aircrew.    These3-9FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2A3-10FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2ACHAPTER 4LANDING SITE SELECTION ANDPREPARATION4-1.  INTRODUCTION4-2.  LANDING ZONE DESIGNATIONThe selection of a usable landing site is extremely im-portant.  Logistical and tactical considerations must beanalyzed and taken into account to assure that the land-ing sites are located at the best place to support the mis-sion.  The area must also be accessible to the aircraftthat are going to use the site.  Since helicopters carryingsling loads may also be carrying internal loads and there-fore have to land, this chapter covers the selection andpreparation of a complete landing site.  The supportedor receiving unit commander, in coordination with theaviation liaison officer, if available, selects and preparesthe landing sites.  The aviation unit liaison officer oraircraft pilot makes the final decision concerning mini-mum requirements or the suitability of the sites.  A land-ing site is an area within a landing zone (LZ) that con-tains one or more landing points.An LZ is an area used for helicopter landing operations.The aircraft may not actually have to land on the groundbut may only need to hover over a load. An LZ mayinclude a number of  landing sites with various  landingpoints for individual  helicopters (Figure 4-1).  Landingzones may be designated by a series of code names.Landing sites and points are marked as designated bythe aviation unit.  Marine Corps landing sites are desig-nated by color and landing points are identified by two-digit numbers such as 11, 15, or 32.  The number oflanding sites required for an operation depends upon themission, terrain, number of aircraft, and the amount ofequipment to be lifted.4-3.  LANDING SITE SELECTIONThe supported or receiving unit, with  advice from theFigure 4-1.  Typical Landing Zone Layout4-1FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2Aaviation unit liaison officer, selects the location of thehelicopter landing sites to best support the operation.The following factors should be considered in the selec-tion of a landing site:a.  Security and Concealment.   Landing sites shouldbe located in areas that allow for maximum security orprotection.  They should be shielded from enemy obser-vation by wooded areas or by masking the terrain.  Theselection of the approach and exit routes should also bebased on the availability of good masking features.b.  Convenience.  Landing sites that are used prima-rily for supply or resupply should be located near stor-age or supply points to reduce ground movement of cargoafter it is delivered.c.  Size.  The size of the landing site depends upon thenumber of landing points within it, the size of the land-       points, the obstructions near or around the landingingsite, and the tactical dispersion required between the land-ing points.  Minimum distance between landing pointswithin a landing site is measured from the center of onelanding point to the center of another.  The diameter ofthe landing point for each type helicopter is shown inTable 4-1.Table 4-1.

CLEARING OBSTACLESEach landing point must be level and firm enough tokeep a fully loaded aircraft’s landing gear from sinkinginto the ground.  The ground is firm enough for size 1and 2 helicopters if it can support a 1 1/4-ton truck.  Ifthe ground can support a 5-ton truck, size 3 through 5helicopters can land without risk of sinking.  The entirelanding point must be cleared of any loose material ordebris to prevent it from being blown into the groundcrew or rotor blades, or drawn into the helicopter en-gines.  Figure 4-2 shows the three different areas andconditions for each size landing point.CAUTIONAll trees, brush, stumps, or other obstaclesthat could cause damage to the rotor bladesor  the  underside  of  the  aircraft  must  becleared around the landing points.  If treesmust be cut, stumps in the immediate vicin-ity of the landing points must be cut as closeto ground level as possible.  It may be neces-sary to use axes, machetes, chain saws, ordemolitions to clear underbrush and trees.                                            grass shorterIt is not necessary to clear                                                                     athan 1 foot that covers a level field unlessfire risk exists.

SLOPE OF SURFACEAlthough helicopters can touchdown hover (one or twobut not all of the wheels are placed on the ground) onany sloping ground which also provides the necessaryrotor clearance, landing sites should be selected that areas level as possible.  Where a slope is present, it should                                    You must confirm the landingbe uniform (Figure 4-3).site with the aviation unit, if the following criteria can-not be met:a.  Daylight Approaches.  During daylight approaches,FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2A4-3FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2AFigure 4-3.  Determining Ground Slope(171 feet).  The 10:1 ratio (a field expedient formula) isthat for every meter of vertical obstacle, you must have10 meters from the center of the landing point to theobstacle.  That is, a landing point center must be 200meters from a 20-meter (66-foot) tree if the helicoptermust approach or depart directly over the tree.4-4FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2Apoint (Figure 4-6).  The V-shaped approach and exit pathis depicted by the dashed and dotted line in the illustra-tion.  The 4-degree maximum obstruction angle appliesto the entire area within the approach and exit path (boththe dark and light shaded area) measured from the land-ing point center to a distance of 3,000 meters.d.  Night Operations.  During night operations, as thepilot gets closer to the landing point, he needs a widerarea for a safe approach than just the 16-degree sector.Therefore, the minimum width of the approach and exitpath, illustrated by the darker shaded area, must be equalto or wider than the width of the landing point that mustbe cleared to a maximum height of 2 feet (Figure 4-2).The length of the minimum width area, dimension X,will vary depending on the size of the landing point.See Table 4-2.Table 4-2.

Table 4-1 identifies the UH-60 Blackhawk as asize 3 helicopter.  Next we must determine the landingpoint area that must be free from obstructions and grasscut to maximum height of 2 feet. Figure 4-2 indicates 50meters as that  area for a size 3 landing point.  There-fore, the minimum width of the night approach and exitpath is 50 meters.  The minimum width distance inter-sects the 16-degree V-shaped arc (night approach andexit path) 180 meters from the center of the landing point.In other words, the night maximum obstruction angleapplies to the complete approach and exit path; both therectangular-shaped wedge (dark shaded area of the dia-gram) as well as the 16-degree V-shaped arc (light shadedarea and dotted line).4-5Figure 4-4.  Maximum Angle of  Approach(Daylight)b.  Night Approach.  Within the night approach andexit path, the maximum obstruction angle should notexceed 4 degrees measured from the center of the land-ing point to a distance of 3,000 meters (9,843 feet) (Fig-ure 4-5).  The maximum obstacle height at 3,000 metersis 210 meters (689 feet).  The field expedient formula isthat for every meter of vertical obstacle, you must have14 meters of distance from the center of the landing pointto the obstacle.  That is, a landing point must be 280meters from a 20-meter tree if the helicopter must ap-proach or exit directly over the tree.  Another night op-eration planning consideration is the helicopter approachand exit path area and the maximum obstacle heightwithin that area.  Remember, this criteria applies to boththe approach path to the landing point as well as the exitpath      from the landing point.  First we must define thearea that is the approach and exit path.Figure 4-5.  Maximum Angle of Approach(Night)c.  Approach and Exit Path.   The approach and exitpath is a 16-degree (277 mils) sector or arc extendingoutward and is measured from the center of the landingFM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2AFigure 4-6.  Approach and Exit Path4-7.  AIRCRAFT FORMATION APPROACH(USA)In large tactical relocations or resupply missions, thehelicopters will normally fly in formation.  The landingsite and the ground crew must be prepared to receivethem.  When possible, helicopters should land in the sameformation in which they are flying.                                                        However, plannedformations may require modification for helicopters toland in some areas.  If a modification in flight formationis required for landing, the change requiring the leastshift of helicopters should be used and the flight leadernotified as soon as radio contact is made.  For commonaircraft formations, see Figure 4-7.  Figure 4-8 illustratesa landing site for three size 3 helicopters landing in avee formation.  Many times size 4 helicopters will notfly in standard flight formations and therefore will bereceived one or two at a time.  In such cases, the landingsite configuration in Figure 4-9 is suggested.  Each air-craft initially approaches and hovers at the inverted “Y”light formation and is then guided to its cargo pickuppoint by the signalman.a.  Daylight Markings.   The landing site should bemarked with marker panels or other visual means.  Smokemay be used, but it also may disclose your position tothe enemy.  If marker panels are used alone, the winddirection is indicated by placing the crossmembers ortop of the “T” into the wind.  The marker panels must besecurely fastened to prevent the helicopter rotor washfrom tearing them from the ground.  If smoke is used,only release it after the pilot requests smoke.  The pilotwill then identify the color and relay it to the groundcrew.  Make sure the smoke canister is far enough awayfrom the landing point that the rotor wash does not pickup the smoke and obstruct the aircrew’s vision.b.  USMC  Markings.   When using marker panels toidentify landing sites, the panels must correspond to thecolor name of the landing site.  If a wind sock is used,position it securely in the center of the landing site.  Land-ing points are indicated by placing the correspondingcolored marker panels in the form of a cross on the land-ing point (Figure 4-10).  Smoke may also be used toidentify landing points.c.  Army Markings.   Army signalmen identify thelanding site by either holding both arms vertically over-head or by holding a folded VS-17 marker panel (NSN8345-00-174-6965) chest high.  He then points to the4-6FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2A4-7FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2A4-8FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2A4-9FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2Amark the landing site.  These lights (Figure 4-13) areplastic tubes filled with a liquid chemical and a glassvial inside containing another chemical.  When the glassvial is broken (by squeezing the plastic tube), a chemi-cal reaction between the two liquids produces a glowinglight.  Depending upon the size of the tube, the glowlasts from 30 minutes to 12 hours.  The chemlights canbe taped or tied to stakes and positioned in the landingsite.  Chemlights are available in different colors andglow times (see Appendix B).i. Glide Angle Indicator Light (GAIL).   (USMC) TheGAIL system is used whenever possible (Figure 4-15).The GAIL is positioned to project its beam along thepreferred direction of approach.  The glide path anglemust provide clearance over the highest obstacle alongthe avenue of approach.  Glide path angles from 3 to 8degrees are common and acceptable.  Angles greater than8 degrees are considered too steep and could cause diffi-culty in maintaining the aircraft on the glide path.  Sincethe GAIL has a narrow beam width, assist the pilot infinding it by placing additional lights in the landing site.Remember, the preferred direction of approach is intothe wind.  However, when the landing site size does notallow the glide path to be directed into the wind withoutexceeding 8 degrees, the GAIL system should be shiftedleft or right to a glide path of less than 8 degrees.  Ap-proach azimuth and glide                                       path angle information aretransmitted to the pilot in the briefing.  When adjustingthe GAIL scope, make sure that it is far enough awayfrom the front marker lights (normally 30 meters) to givethe pilot enough distance to maneuver over the landingpoint.  It may be necessary to secure the GAIL scope tothe ground using sand bags or tent pins, so that it is notblown over by the helicopter rotor wash.Figure 4-13.  Chemlight Stickh.  Emergency Lighting.  During an emergency, vari-ous lighting patterns can be used with proper coordina-tion between the aircrew and ground personnel.  A com-mon method using vehicles is shown in Figure 4-14.  Thismethod should only be used in an emergency because itimpairs the pilot’s night vision and can disclose the land-ing site position.

INTRODUCTIONThis chapter discusses general load hookup and releaseprocedures and related operations including types andpreparation of some loads.  It also discusses operationsunder difficult conditions, such as desert, snow, aboardship, and at night.5-2.  GENERAL HOOKUP PROCEDURESPositions in relation to the aircraft are referred to by ano’clock system (Figure 5-1): 12 o’clock position is the       of the aircraft, 3 o’clock position is the right (star-noseboard) side, and 9 o’clock is the left (port) side.  Avoidapproaching or departing under the aircraft from the 4o’clock position clockwise around to the 8 o’clock posi-tion due to hazards presented by landing gear, tail rotor,and the inability of the aircrew to monitor the groundcrew.4Figure 5-1.  Helicopter Station Diagram5-1FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2Agested areas and provides optimum safety.  Avoid areasof dust, mud, snow, or ice.b.  Surface Conditions.  Grassy fields, edges of run-ways, ramps, or paved roads normally provide good sur-face for sling load operations.  Once the commander hasdesignated the areas to be used, ground crew personnelclear the landing site and set up markings to identify thearea from the air.  When the situation permits, they co-ordinate with the pilot to determine which way the heli-copter will go in an emergency.c.  Cargo Preparation.   Before the operation starts,the ground crew must make sure that the cargo has beencorrectly prepared, rigged, and inspected for sling load-ing.  If vehicles or equipment are not prepared properly,they could be damaged when lifted by the helicopter.Loads should be pre-positioned to expedite hookup.d.  Static Wand.  The static wand person drives thegrounding rod into the ground on the side of the loadopposite the rendezvous point/exit path.  See Chapter 3for detailed instructions concerning the grounding rodand static discharge wand.e.  Positioning Personnel (Army).   As the helicopterapproaches the landing site, the ground crew personnelput on their equipment and take up their positions.  Thesignalman positions himself at the aircraft’s 12 o’clockposition, upwind of the load, facing the load and theaircraft (Figure 5-2).  The USMC outside director is re-ferred to as a signalman.f.  Positioning Personnel (USMC).    Marine CorpsHST operations require different positions for the HSTpersonnel (Figure 5-3).  As the helicopter approachesthe landing site, the outside director is at a position of 2(or 10) o’clock upwind of the load.  From this positionhe is able to guide the helicopter over the load  withassistance from the                              inside director.  The helicoptercrewman may also provide directional information tothe pilot as the helicopter approaches the load when im-mediate response is required.g.  Positioning Hookup and Static Wand Personnel.The hookup man and static wand person go to their po-sitions on top of the load.  The hookup man is the first todepart the load; therefore, he should be on the side ofthe load closest to the rendezvous point exit path.  The5-2Figure 5-2.  Ground Crew Initial PositionFigure 5-3.  HST Initial Positionstatic wand person is the last person to leave the load, sohe should be on the opposite side of the load.  The hookupteam may be stationed on the ground along the side ofFM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2Athe load if the load is difficult or unsafe to stand on.Any extra personnel, such as equipment operators, willbe positioned so that they are clear of the hookup areaand away from the approach and exit paths.  No person-nel should be positioned on the ground in the approachpath between the load and the aircraft.h.  Hookup Team Procedures.  Hookup team person-nel should kneel down, brace themselves, and hold se-curely to the load because of the rotor wash.  The hookupman will have the apex fitting/web ring in his hands readyfor hookup.  The static wand person will hold the staticdischarge wand so that the red line or the DO NOTHOLD area is above the hookup team’s helmets, as inFigure 5-4.(1)  The signalman identifies himself and the loadfor the pilot by holding up both arms,5-3FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2Amaintain  visual  contact  at  all  times  throughout  thehookup.(3)  If the signalman cannot determine which pilot isflying the aircraft, he should position himself at a 45-degree angle from the nose of the aircraft in an openarea so the pilot can clearly see him and his hand-and-arm signals.  The signals must be precisely given to pre-vent any misunderstandings between the signalman andthe pilot.  While the helicopter is hovering, the signal-man is responsible for the safety of the hookup team.The hookup team must alertly watch the helicopter dur-ing the complete operation (Figure 5-6).     (4)  The helicopter approaches the load with the pen-dant or hook prepared for hookup.  The pilot maneuversin position over the load as directed by the signalmanand the aircrew member.  The aircrew member normallygives final maneuver and hookup instructions to the pi-lot over the aircraft interphone.(5)  After the aircraft passes over the hookup team,the rotor wash decreases.  At that time, the hookup teamstands up and watches for the cargo hook or moves un-der the aircraft for hookup on signal from the aircrew ifnot pre-positioned on or by the load.  Once the helicop-Figure 5-6.  Relationship of Aircraft, Signalman, and Hookup Crew5-4FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2AFigure 5-7.

Ifthe  problem  can  be  easily  corrected,  he  signals  thehookup team or sling leg team to return to the load toguide the sling legs as described in the previous para-graph.  If the problem is more serious, he signals thepilot to release the load so that the sling legs can beuntangled and the hookup repeated.  The pilot hoversaway from the load, if required, so that the ground crewand sling legs are not blown about by the rotor wash.5-3.  SAFETY PRECAUTIONS FOR HOOKUPPERSONNELThe following safety precautions are recommended forhookup personnel:•  Clear the area around the load of all objects thatcould be blown around by the rotor wash.•  Limit the number of personnel involved in the hookupoperation.•  Wear protective equipment.  A protective mask orhelmet with a visor, such as the MC-140 helmet, is rec-ommended to aid vision during high winds and turbu-lence caused by the rotor wash.  At a minimum, weareye goggles.  Wear clothing that will protect againstblowing sand and dust and not become snagged on thecargo.•  Place the apex fitting/web ring and sling legs on topof the load (or to the side of the load) so that during thehookup or lift-off, the legs will not become entangledon the load.  •  Use hand-and-arm signals to direct the helicopter asshown in Appendix A.  •  Maintain adequate clearance between the hoveringhelicopter and ground personnel at all times.•  Wear electrical workers gloves as applicable anduse a static discharge wand during all hookups.5-6•  Exercise sound judgment and common sense whenstationing yourself by or on a sling load so that if theload is either accidentally dragged along by the hover-ing helicopter or prematurely lifted from the ground, youcan move clear to avoid injury.•  For more details concerning these safety precautionsand the designated rendezvous point (USA), see Chap-ters 1 and 3.5-4.  LOAD RELEASE PROCEDURESLanding site preparation, safety precautions, protectiveequipment, and ground crew requirements for load re-lease are similar to those required for hookup.  The sig-nalman is located in the same position with respect tothe helicopter and landing point and directs the pilot tothe load release point.  When the load is over the releasepoint, he signals the pilot to lower the load to the groundand hover to the side before giving the pilot the “re-lease-load” signal.  The pilot hovers to one side of theload to prevent the apex fitting from falling on the loadand causing damage.  If spreader bars are used in rig-ging the load, the pilot should hover low enough to restthe spreader bars on the load before releasing the apexfitting.  If the aircrew cannot open the cargo hook, thepilot will notify the signalman.  After the aircrew sig-nals to the ground crew, they approach the cargo hookto manually release the load.  The static wand personuses the static discharge wand to contact the cargo hook.The  hookup  man  either  depresses  the  spring-loadedkeeper on the cargo hook or rotates the manual releaseknob/lever.  When the load is released, the signalmangives the “affirmative” signal, followed by the “take-off’ signal.5-5.  DUAL-POINT HOOKUP PROCEDURESThe same basic safety and hookup procedures apply dur-ing  dual-point  load  hookup  as  during  single-pointhookup.  An extra hookup person is required for the ad-ditional apex fitting.  The H-53E requires a static wandperson for each cargo hook.  Since the CH-47D requiresonly one static wand person, he may maintain contactwith any one of the three cargo hooks, but because nohookup man is at the center hook, it usually is the easi-est hook to contact.FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2Aa.  Dual-point Procedures.   Dual-point load riggingprocedures may be different from single-point riggingprocedures, When possible, coordinate with the aircrewbefore attempting a dual-point hookup.  Either cargo hookcan be connected first.  Do not mistakenly connect oneof the slings to the center cargo hook.b.  Aircraft Position.   The hookup teams must con-                                                                           cargostantly be aware of the position of the aircraft andhook.  It is difficult for the aircrew member to watchboth hookup teams as the aircraft hovers over the load.The pendant system on the H-53E (Figure 5-8) enhanceshookup team safety by increasing load separation.WARNINGUse extreme caution when attaching the apexfitting to the cargo hook during a dual-pointhookup. The aircraft must hover close to theload which could cause the aircraft to strikethe load or personnel.  Special care must betaken when connecting the aft hook. The rearof the aircraft has a tendency to dip down ifthe pilot has to move to the rear.5-6.  MULTIPLE SINGLE-POINT LOAD PREPA-RATIONCargo nets, fuel drums, and water drums are commonmultiple single-point loads transported by the CH-47D(Figure 5-9).  Load height and weight must be consid-ered during the planning phase. Keep in mind that whenthe aircraft is at a hover, the rear cargo hook is lowerthan the front hook. In order to keep the aircraft center ofbalance within the allowable limits, if the loads will bereleased at different landing sites, the heaviest load shouldbe connected to the center hook and the lightest load tothe aft hook.5-7.  PIGGYBACK/ACCOMPANYING LOADSPiggyback or accompanying loads are used to expeditethe movement of weapon systems and ammunition at thesame time.  Small quantities of ammunition are bundledon the howitzer trails.  Larger quantities are carried in5-7FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2A5-8FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2A(for example, a  howitzer, ammunition, and assigned guncrew).  This system eliminates the need for a  static wand                                       electricity is discharged whenperson because the staticthe aircraft lands.  Also, all of the equipment, crew, andaccompanying ammunition can be moved in one lift.  Avertical pendant is connected to the apex fitting of thenormally rigged load.  A second apex fitting is used onthe other end of the vertical pendant to hook to the heli-copter (Figure 5-11).  A polyester roundsling of suitablecapacity or a leg from a 25,000-pound capacity sling setmay be used.  The helicopter lands next to the riggedload.  The hookup man takes the apex fitting, crawlsunder the helicopter, and places the apex fitting on thecargo hook.  The entire crew, to include the signalmanand hookup man, waits for the aircrew member to signalthem to board the aircraft.  Make sure you follow theirFigure 5-11.  Extended Sling System5-9FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2A5-10.  COLD WEATHER OPERATIONSWhen helicopter sling load operations are conducted ina cold climate, ground personnel must know cold weather                             practices.  Cold weather adverselyhazards and safetyaffects personnel performance which increases the haz-ards of conducting helicopter sling load operations.  Per-sonnel could become careless and that could lead tomisrigging cargo and improper hookup.  Personnel mayalso be more likely to fall off equipment.a.  Special Considerations for Operating in ColdWeather.  When conducting sling load operations incold weather, maintain a high level of combat readinessand morale, by doing the following:(1)  Plan ahead.  Know the immediate environment,weather conditions, emergency medical procedures, andsupport sources.(2)  Prepare personnel and equipment for cold weatherexposure.(3)  Use heated shelters, if available.  If constructionis limited, rotate personnel to a heated shelter.  Ten-mantents with a heater can serve this purpose.(4)  Ensure ground crew wears required protectiveequipment.  Clothing should provide protection from theelements, including rotor wash, snow, water, and ice par-ticles, without restricting movement of personnel.  Inorder to prevent hands from freezing to cold metal sur-faces, personnel should wear anticontact gloves.  Forthe Marine Corps, the cold weather squad survival kit isrequired for each ground crew team.b.  Windchill Precautions.  Cold weather causes yourbody to lose heat through convection and the loss is ac-celerated as wind velocity increases.  The combinedcooling effect of wind and cold air is called windchillfactor.  Table 5-1 shows the effect of wind on tempera-ture.  Helicopter rotor wash has the same windchill ef-fect as wind.  Arctic windchill near a hovering aircraftcan freeze exposed flesh quickly.  Personnel must beaware of this hazard and must be briefed on the increasedchances of frostbite.  All personnel should be trained torecognize the signs of hypothermia and frostbite and howto apply proper first aid.  c.  Static Discharge Precautions.   In dry arctic air,static electricity from a hovering helicopter can producea large voltage shock.  The dry air, colder temperatures,and blowing snow increase the amount of static electric-ity generated by and stored in the aircraft.  Proper ground-ing of the aircraft’s cargo hook is absolutely essential.Snow and low temperatures increase the problem withproper grounding due to snow depth and frozen ground.WIND SPEED(KNOTS)AIRTEMP   40Table 5-1.

This may require the ground crewto dig out the snow and break up the ground so that thegrounding rod can be properly inserted.(5)  If more than one helicopter will be landing si-multaneously, the landing points should be at least 100meters apart to prevent blowing snow from obstructingthe view of other helicopter crews.d.  Equipment Precautions.  Do not store cargo slingsand nets in extremely cold weather for long periods oftime.  Store them in heated areas, if possible.  It is espe-cially important to keep all lifting devices dry in coldweather operations.  The coating on the 40,000-poundcapacity sling set may become brittle.  Slings and netsmay also become brittle, reducing their useful life andincreasing the chances of sling failure.  All sling loadsshould be moved slightly before pickup to ensure thatthey are not frozen or otherwise held fast to the surface.If the load is icy, use extreme caution to keep your foot-ing when walking or standing on it, especially duringhookup.e.  Landing Site Preparations.  Information in Chap-ter 4 also applies to landing site selection considerationsin cold weather.  Blowing snow from the rotor wash(whiteout) causes a loss of vision for the aircrew andground crew.   Site preparation and marking may devi-ate from standard operations because of snow conditions(for instance, depth of snow, extent of coverage, pres-ence of ice, frozen ground, and possible low visibility).To prepare a snow covered landing site, follow theseprocedures:(1)  The ground crew determines the depth of thesnow in the appropriate locations for helicopter landingpoints.(2)  If time and snow density allow, pack the snow orcompress the snow to prevent it from blowing and toprovide a solid surface for the helicopter to land.(3)  Make sure all personnel remain clear of the rotorblades, as they may be closer to the ground than normalbecause of the snow height.(4)  Probe the snow under the landing point for ob-stacles such as large rocks, stumps, and uneven or steepterrain which could damage the helicopter.  If the area           be cleared for safe landing, select a new landingcannotpoint.f.  Marking the Landing Site.   Marking the landingsite and landing points is critical because of the rotorwash which causes blowing or driven snow (whiteoutcondition).  This condition can blind both the aircrewand ground crew.  The helicopter crew must be providedwith markings to be used as reference points at eachlanding point.(1)  The landing site or point can be marked usingconventional panels, GAIL lights, strobe lights, or simi-lar indicators.  The area can also be marked by usingrescue survival dyes, food coloring (or food items suchas Kool-Aid), dirt sprinkled in the snow, or any darkmaterial.(2)  A smoke grenade can be used to mark the land-ing site or point and also to indicate wind direction, butit must be placed on a hard surface to prevent it fromsinking or melting into the snow.  Do not use whitesmoke.(3)  (USMC) Landing guides are used to guide thepilot to a safe landing or hover at each landing point.Landing guides are ground personnel who stand at thehelicopter’s 12 o’clock position and act as additionalreference points.  They do not provide hand-and-armsignals.  The landing guides should wear internationalorange vests and face masks.  If landing guides are notavailable, large, dark colored bags filled with snow andplaced in the landing guides’ positions may be used aslanding point indicators.  Advise the aircraft unit as tothe depth of snow (packed or unpacked), type of snow(powder, crusted, or hard), and any special considerationsthat will delay hookup.5-11.  DESERT OPERATIONSMany of the same problems or considerations found incold weather operations are also present in desert opera-tions.  Brownout (loss of vision from blowing sand) pre-sents the same visual and reference problems as whit-eout.  The procedures of using additional reference pointsand paddles are considered essential for safe and effi-cient sling load operations.  High temperatures and ex-5-11FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2Acessive dust particles greatly increase the buildup of staticelectricity.  Again, proper grounding is required to ad-equately protect the ground crew.  Drive the groundingrod as far into the ground as possible and wet the areaaround the base of the grounding rod to increase con-ductivity.5-12.  NIGHT OPERATIONSa.  General Considerations.  Since it is more danger-ous to conduct sling load operations during darkness,extensive training and detailed planning become increas-ingly important. It is important to realize that certainproblems will exist at night that do not occur during day-light operations.  Common night problems include in-creased time required for hookup, tendency for helicop-ter to drift during hover, and lack of depth perceptionfor crew members and ground personnel.  During nightoperations, hand-and-arm signals are the same as in dayoperations except that flashlight wands with night vi-sion  goggles  (NVG)  compatible  lighting  or  infraredchemlites are used.b.  Night Equipment.  Whenever possible, and if thetactical situation permits, personnel should wear reflec-tive vests.  At a minimum, the signalman should wearNVG.            Chemlights attached to the top of the load assistthe aircrew in identifying the load; likewise, a chemlightattached to the cargo hook aids the hookup team duringthe hookup operation.  Some helicopters are equippedwith lights positioned by the cargo hook.  The aircrewidentifies which cargo hook to use by illuminating thecorresponding light.c.  NVG Operations.   The preferred method of con-ducting night sling load operations is with fully trainedground crews or HST support and with utilization of nightvision goggles (NVG).  Normal nighttime illumination(white or red lights) can temporarily blind personnelwearing NVG.  Therefore, you must use NVG-compat-ible lights (blue-green) when conducting NVG sling loadoperations.  Infrared  chemlights, blue-green chemlights,or flashlights with blue-green lens covers and plasticwands are effective during NVG operations.5-13.  SHIPBOARD OPERATIONS AND SAFETYPROCEDURESa.  Operations.   Helicopter sling load operations5-12aboard ships require a greater level of awareness thanshore operations because of the increased hazards.  Someof the major hazards are:(1)  Confined helicopter operating area.(2)  Pitching and rolling decks.(3)  Wet and slippery decks.(4)  Helicopter rotor wash and ship’s movement.(5)  Potential of being blown overboard.(6)  Increased instability of hovering helicopters dueto winds and turbulence.(7)  Increased potential of being struck by helicopterrotor blades.b.  Training.  The most important factor in shipboardsling load operations is thoroughly trained personnel.During shipboard operations, designated ship personnelare responsible for supervising and controlling all slingload operations.  On a landing ship dock (LSD), landinghelicopter assault (LHA), landing platform helicopter(LPH), landing ship tank (LST), and landing platformdock (LPD), embarked Marines or soldiers are assignedto assist the combat cargo officer (CCO) and the flightdeck officer.NOTE: Other services' equipment may be differentfrom the Navy’s and require different hookup proce-dures.  It may be necessary to request modification ofthe safety requirements listed in NWP-42, ShipboardHelicopter Operating Procedures.  Personnel partici-pating in sling load operations must be thoroughlytrained and wear the required protective clothing.  Inall cases, safety is the primary consideration.c.  Types of Operations.   Shipboard operations in-volve three types of sling load missions: vertical replen-ishment (see Chapter 9), vertical on board delivery, andlogistical missions involving ship-to-shore movement.All of these missions require strict adherence to estab-lished shipboard safety procedures.d.  Planning.  During planning for shipboard sling loadoperations,  the  supported  unit  and  transporting  unitFM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2Ashould  review  NAVAIR  00-80T-106,  LHA/LPHNATOPS manual; or when sling load operations are tobe conducted from an LPD or LSD, review NWP-42.  Aliaison meeting should be conducted with a representa-tive from the following ship’s divisions: operations, air,deck, and combat cargo.  A complete inventory of eachunit’s equipment is contained in the unit’s embarkation/debarkation plan and specific equipment that is plannedto be lifted by helicopter should be provided to the CCO.e.  Safety Procedures.  During sling load operations,personnel must be thoroughly trained on safety proce-dures and wear appropriate protective clothing.  Duringshipboard operations, all personnel must adhere to thefollowing:(1)  Strict compliance to signals by the landing sig-nal enlisted (LSE).(2)  During hookup, all personnel except the LSE,the hookup man, and static wand person must clear thepickup or delivery area.(3)  Flight deck personnel and ground crew must wearapproved life jackets, helmets with chin straps and fas-teners, goggles, safety shoes, and ear protection.  Loosearticles of clothing should not be worn.  Personnel mustremove all loose articles (such as covers and rags) fromtheir pockets.(4)  All personnel in the vicinity of the helicoptermust remove their soft covers/hats while the helicopterrotors are turning.(5)  Observe the aircraft carefully for any sign of mal-function and immediately report any such conditions toflight deck personnel in charge.(6)  Personnel must be instructed concerning the dan-ger created when rotor blades strike a solid object.(7)  The flight deck must be cleared of all objectswhich can be blown around by the rotor wash or ingestedinto the engines.(8)  Do not attempt to steady a load or move towardsthe load until the load is on the deck.5-13FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2ACHAPTER 6CARGO SLINGSTHIS CHAPTER IMPLEMENTS STANAG 29496-1.

If a part is damaged,each component of the sling set is replaceable.a.  Apex Fitting.  The metal apex fitting (Figure 6-2)gathers the sling legs and attaches the sling set to thehelicopter hook.  Each apex fitting consists of a clevis,pin, spacer, and castelated nut and cotter pin.  The 10,000-pound capacity clevis is made of aluminum and uses a 11/8-inch diameter pin.  The 25,000-pound capacity cle-vis is made of alloy steel and is fitted with a 1 1/2-inchdiameter pin.NOTE:    The  use  of  any  sling  load  lifting  devicenot  listed  in  this  manual  is  not  authorized.6-1FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2A6-2FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2AFigure 6-2.  Apex Fitting Components(1)  The pin on both apex fittings is secured with a 3/8-inch bolt and a castellated nut and cotter pin.(2)  The castellated nut and a cotter pin are a morepositive means of securing the bolt since the cotter pinis easily visible.  Tighten the nut until the cotter pin can                  through a castellation in the nut and the holebe placedin the bolt.  Spread the ends of the cotter pin apart tokeep the nut from loosening.(3)  The apex fitting pin is placed directly onto thecargo hook, except for the UH-1.  A 3-foot nylon aerialdelivery sling or 10-inch nylon donut must be used be-tween the sling and aircraft hook because of the uniqueshear pin design on the UH-1 hook.  Use a basket hitchto place the 3-foot nylon aerial delivery sling on the apexfitting (Figure 6-3).(4)  All new sling sets are furnished with an improvedapex  fitting  assembly  which  includes  an  aluminumspacer.  This spacer is required on the 10,000-pound ca-pacity apex fitting when the load is lifted by a UH-60helicopter.  The spacer prevents the apex fitting fromworking under and raising the spring-loaded keeper.  Thespacer also centers the apex fitting on any cargo hookand reduces the shock load to the cargo hook caused byFigure 6-3.  Three-foot Sling, Basket-Hitched onApex Fitting for UH-1oscillating and rotating loads.  Since these spacers aremade of aluminum, some deformation or gouging of thesurface is to be expected.  This in no way affects theserviceability of the apex fitting.  File down any burrs orgouges.(5)  You can continue to use apex fittings withoutspacers on other aircraft, but you should update yoursling sets by ordering the proper spacer.  The 25,000-pound capacity apex fitting with a spacer will not passthrough the opening in the UH-60 cargo hook.NOTE:  The pin always goes up and attaches onto theaircraft cargo hook (Figure 6-4).6-3FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2Ab.  Nylon Rope Assembly.  The nylon rope assemblyis made from double-braided nylon rope with an eyesplice at each end.  Cutting and splicing of the rope iscarefully controlled to produce an assembly which isapproximately 12 feet long.  During manufacture, theouter braid is covered with a liquid nylon which, whendry, provides protection against scuffing and shields therope against ultraviolet radiation.  This process and otherenvironmental conditions during shipment and storagecan result in considerable shrinkage in the rope assem-bly length.  Much of this shrinkage is temporary and thespecified length should be restored with use.  To ensureproper load distribution, the variation in length of therope legs used in a sling assembly should not exceed 6inches.  The 10,000-pound capacity sling set has olivedrab colored ropes while the 25,000-pound capacity slingset ropes are black.                            Each sling leg assembly has one-fourth of the capacity of the complete sling set.  There-fore, the capacity of one sling leg from a 10,000- and25,000-pound sling set is 2,500 and 6,250 pounds, re-spectively.  Outer jacket yarns in the olive drab 2,500-pound capacity rope are identified by a braided strandabout 3/32 inch in diameter.  In the black 6,250-poundcapacity rope, yarns are about 1/8 inch in diameter.  Anadditional polyurethane coated outer braid is used as athimble at each eye splice to protect the nylon rope fromcuts or abrasion.  Polyurethane is also potted into the V-shaped portion of the eye splice to prevent sand or othermaterial from entering and damaging the rope fibers.The part number, NSN, manufacture date, and capacityof the individual legs are embossed on one side of thiscone-shaped potting.  The part number and NSN of thecomplete sling set is embossed on the other side of thepotted area.  Figure 6-6 shows two cross-sectional draw-ings that are the actual size of the rope legs used withthe 10,000- and 25,000-pound capacity sling sets.  c.  Grabhook Assembly.  The grabhook assembly (Fig-ure 6-7) is attached to the lower eye of the nylon ropeand attaches the nylon rope assembly to the chain.  It isused to adjust the chain length.  The upper part of thegrabhook (the yoke) contains a pin and spacer that areused to attach the nylon rope to the grabhook.  A snapring holds the pin in place.  The spacer provides a largediameter surface for the eye of the nylon rope.  The bot-tom part of the grabhook has an eye at one side.  Theattached coupling link connects the chain to the grab-hook assembly.  Opposite the eye is a hook into whichany selected chain link is inserted to vary the length of1342Figure 6-4.  Proper Orientation of Apex Fitting(6)  Four nylon rope legs are usually attached to theapex fitting.  Six rope legs can be attached to one apexfitting if the load requires it.  In order to keep the slinglegs from becoming tangled, sling legs are numbered inthe following sequence: 1 and 2 are the outer sling legs,3 and 4 are the inner sling legs, and if necessary, 5 and 6are the innermost sling legs (Figure 6-5).  Odd-numberedsling legs are connected to the left side of the load; there-fore, they are on the left side of the apex.  Apex fittingscan be interchanged between both sling sets as long asthe apex fitting capacity is greater than the load weight.If a load is rigged with only one sling leg, you can attachthe top eyelet of the sling leg directly on the cargo hook,eliminating the need for the apex fitting.Figure 6-5.

Rig-gers must ensure that the attachment pointson all equipment are sound and that properrigging procedures are used.  Chapter 8 con-tains information on connecting sling legsused as vertical pendants.10,000-pound capacity sling set.  Every tenth link ispainted olive drab to  help when you count the links.The chain is attached to the grabhook so that the freeend  will contain 10 links to the first painted link  (Fig-ure 6-8).  If the tenth link is not painted,  you may wantto remove the paint from all of  the painted links andrepaint the links  making sure you paint each tenth linkstarting from the free end.  When rigging a load, alwayscount the chain links from the free end.  If an additionalchain length is required by the rigging procedures, use acoupling link to add it to the existing chain.CAUTIONNylon cord or pressure-sensitive tape shouldbe used to secure the excess chain.  Tying offthe excess links just below the grabhook willhelp keep the chain in the slot and preventthe  chain  from  damaging  the  item  beinglifted. If the rigging procedures prescribe a10,000-pound capacity sling set, but a 25,000-pound capacity sling set is the only one avail-able, use the conversion table in Appendix Cto cross-reference the chain links.WARNINGDo not use a 10,000-pound capacity sling setwhen a 25,000-pound capacity sling set is re-quired.e.  Making the Sling Set Fit the Load.   A completesling set comes with four legs.  However, some loadsmay have more than four lifting provisions and othersmay have less.  The following information explains indetail how to add or remove legs from either sling set.6-6FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2A(1)  The overall capacity of the sling set changes aswe add or subtract sling legs.  If you add legs to a slingset, the capacity of the clevis does not change.  There-fore, a six-legged 10,000-pound capacity sling set willstill safely carry only 10,000 pounds.  If one leg is re-moved, the 10,000-pound capacity set will be able tocarry only 7,500 pounds while the 25,000-pound capac-ity sling set can carry 18,750 pounds.WARNINGEach  of  the  four  legs  of  the  10,000-  and25,000-pound capacity sling sets will carryonly one-fourth of the overall capacity of theset.     (2)  You may rig a load such as a fuel drum that hasonly two lift points.  In this case, run two chains througheach hookup point.  This will allow the full capacity ofthe sling to be used.  If the load is less than half thecapacity of the sling set, you can use just two sling legs,one leg to each hookup point as shown in Figure 6-9.(3)  You may also use this method when hooking upa load with only three lift points (Figure 6-10).  Routethe extra chain leg through one of the hookup points anduse the same chain link number.  You will be less likelyto lose the fourth sling leg, and the sling set will be readyfor another load.(4)  Some loads use six lift provisions.  Figure 6-11shows that the apex fitting was disassembled and twoadditional legs were added.(5)  Remember, this sling set can still only transport10,000 pounds of cargo.  Even though the six sling legscould carry 15,000 pounds, the apex fitting can only carry10,000 pounds.     (6)  Some loads can be carried in the dual-point con-figuration.  Dual-point loads require an additional apexfitting for the extra sling set (Figure 6-12).Figure 6-9.  Load with Two Lift PointsFigure 6-10.  Load with Three Lift Points6-7FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2AFigure 6-11.  Six-leg Sling SetFigure 6-12.  Dual-Point Loadf.  Adding or Subtracting Sling Legs.   Follow thesefive steps when adding or subtracting sling legs:(1)  Remove cotter pin and nut from the apex fittingpin bolt.(2)  Remove the bolt from the pin (Figure 6-13).(3)  Pull the pin and spacer out of the clevis.(4)  Add or remove the sling legs as required.6-8Figure 6-13.  Bolt Assembly     (5)  Place the apex fitting spacer in the clevisopening.  Install the pin, bolt, and nut and secure withthe cotter pin.CAUTIONCheck to make sure the nut is tight and thecotter pin is installed on the castellated nutbefore every lift.NOTE:  If the nylon rope portion of the sling legis  severely  damaged,  you  must  replace  the  ny-lon  rope  assembly  of  the  sling.    Besides  remov-ing  one  end  from  the  apex  fitting,  you  must  alsoremove  the  other  end  from  the  grabhook  assem-bly.    When  replacing  a  nylon  rope,  make  surethe  replacement  rope  length  is  within  6  inchesof  the  other  sling  legs.g.  Disassembling the Grabhook Assembly.   The fol-lowing steps explain how to replace a rope assembly orcomponent of the grabhook assembly.  Disassemble thekeeper and pin as follows:     (1)  Using a pin punch and hammer, drive out the rollpin.  If the roll pin has been replaced by a bolt and nut,unscrew the nut and remove the bolt (Figure 6-14).(2)  Tilt the grabhook and remove the spring andkeeper (Figure 6-15).FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2AFigure 6-14.  Removing Bolt and Nut from Grabhook(3)  Position the small end of the keeper so that thenotch cut is centered on the protruding portion insidethe hook.  Push down on the other end of the keeper toalign the holes.(4)  Use a pointed tool, such as an ice pick or awl, tohelp align the spring, grabhook, and keeper.  Slowly with-draw the tool as you install the roll pin or bolt.(5)  Install the nut on the bolt.  Do not overtightenthe nut because the keeper must be free to move.  i.  Removing and Reinstalling Coupling Links.   Re-moving and reinstalling the coupling link is a simpleoperation.  Use a hammer and a small pin punch to re-move the securing pin from the coupling link or ham-mer lock.  A spring inside the spacer secures the pin.Drive out the pin.  Reassemble the coupling link in re-verse order of disassembly.  Replace the coupling link ifthe spring does not secure the pin inside the spacer.  Fig-ure 6-16 shows the coupling link that is used to attachthe chain leg to the grabhook.Figure 6-15.  Spring-Keeper Assembly(3)  Remove the snap ring that secures the pin.  Donot over-expand the snap ring because this may cause itto break or not spring back into shape.(4)  Remove the pin and the spacer bar.(5)  Replace the sling leg, if necessary.h.  Reassembling the Grabhook.   Reassemble thegrabhook as follows:(1)  Place the spacer inside the sling leg eyelet andposition the sling leg in the grabhook opening.  Installpin through grabhook and spacer so the head of the pinis on the keeper side.  Reinstall the snap ring.  Do notreuse a snap ring if it does not seat uniformly into thesnap ring groove.(2)  Position the long end of the keeper spring againstthe inside edge of the keeper with the short end againstthe pin.   Figure 6-16.  Coupling Link  j.  Sling Set Proof Load Testing.   Neither initial norperiodic proof load testing of the 10,000- and 25,000-pound capacity sling sets is required to be performed byusing units.  Each sling set component is proof load testedby the manufacturer before delivery.  In addition, break-ing strength testing of the rope assemblies is done on asampling basis.  Proof load testing of repaired sling setsis not required since the only authorized repair is byreplacement of  tested components.  The above prooftesting satisfies the requirements of Army TB 43-0142for the 10,000- and 25,000-pound capacity sling sets.  Ifthese slings are inspected according to the requirements6-9FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2Aof the next paragraph and Table 6-2 that follows, thereshould be no fear of dropping a sling load through fail-ure of the sling components.k.  Sling Set Inspection.  Inspect the sling set by usingthe procedures in TM 10-1670-295-23&P.  Table 6-2 isa guide to assist in determining the type of damage on asling set.(1)  Before using a sling set, inspect all metal com-ponents for proper operation, rust, corrosion, cracks,bends, distortions, burrs, sharp edges, grease, oil, acid,or foreign matter.  Check for any missing components.If bends, cracks, distortions, or other damages are present,the sling cannot be used until you have compared thedamage with the damage criteria chart.  Replace anycomponents that are damaged beyond the allowable limit.(2)  Determining the servicability of the sling legs isthe most difficult and important part of inspecting thesling set.  Serious damage or weakening of sling legscan occur without visual damage to the fibers.  Ropesthat are known to have been severely overloaded or shockloaded, such as the remaining legs of a sling set afterone leg has broken, should be removed from service.Ropes can also be severely weakened by exposure tocertain chemicals.  Ropes with rust stains or stains ofunknown origin should be removed from service.  Eachsling leg should be individually inspected for cuts, snags,or worn strands.  Pulled strands should be worked backinto the rope.  The outer braid of the leg is constructedwith 24 strands which allows for a certain amount ofdamage as listed in Table 6-2.  No damage to the corebraid is allowed.  Some fuzziness on the outer surface ofthe nylon leg is normal.  If surface roughness increasesor nylon slivers or splinters are present, remove the legfrom service.  If any doubt exists as to the condition ofthe sling leg, remove it from service.(3)  Each link of the chain should be inspected fordamage such as denting, bending, and stretching.  If anylink is damaged, the complete chain section must be re-placed.  This type of damage will normally occur wherethe links contacted the load lift provision where the chainwas inserted in the grabhook.  The best time to inspectthe chain is when derigging a load.l.  Sling Set Care and Storage.   The ground crew orunit personnel may perform maintenance on the 10,000-6-10and 25,000-pound capacity sling sets.  The sling sets areinspected by the user before and after each use.  At thepresent time, these sling sets have no predetermined ser-               The six basic steps to prepare slings for stor-vice life.age at the organizational level are as follows:(1)   Wash off dirt and corrosive fluids with a milddetergent or hand soap.(2)  After washing, rinse thoroughly and then air drythe sling sets. (Do not wring water out of the rope nordry the legs in the sun.)(3)  Remove corrosion from metal parts with a wirebrush or emery cloth.(4)  Remove burrs or sharp edges from metal partswith a file.(5)  Replace any defective components.(6)  Store the sling sets in the aviator’s kit bag that isfurnished with each sling set.  Store the sling sets in adry area that has good air circulation.  Do not store thesling sets in direct sunlight or on concrete floors.  Storethem on wooden pallets  if possible, because air can cir-culate under and around the slings.m.  Quality Deficiency Report.  Misuse or poor work-manship can cause equipment to break or malfunction.To help identify these problems, the user must informthe materiel developer/procurer of any malfunctions us-ing Standard Form 368 (Quality Deficiency Report) ac-cording to DA Pam 738-750.  All services should sub-mit reports on equipment failures and/or recommenda-tions for improvements to the sling sets or any associ-ated equipment to Commander, US Army Troop Com-mand, ATTN: AMSAT-I-MDO, St. Louis, MO 63120-1798.6-4.  15,000-POUND CAPACITY NYLON ANDCHAIN MULTILEG SLING SETThe 15,000-pound multileg cargo sling (nylon and chainleg) has four sling legs (Figure 6-17).  Each sling leg iscomprised of 15 feet of nylon strap, a grab link, and 6feet of chain.  At one end of the nylon leg is a nylon webring which attaches the sling set to the aircraft cargohook.

Three of the keepers are sewn to the nylon loopsand the other two are called floating web keepers.  Thefloating web keepers are located at either end of the ny-lon leg where they can slide back and forth to act as acinch.  All web keepers are held together by a no-sewfitting as shown in Figure 6-19.  c.  Grab Link Assembly.   The next item on the slingset, the metal grab link, is attached to the lower end ofthe nylon web sling leg.  This grab link is equippedwith a spring-loaded keeper as shown in the inset ofFigure 6-20.  At the lower end of the grab link youwill see the coupling link that is used to connect thechain leg to the grab link.  d.  Chain Assembly.   The last part of the sling set isthe 6-foot chain which has 64 links.  These links areused to vary the length of the sling legs.  To accommo-date the load, leg length is adjusted by passing the freeend of the chain through the attachment point on theload and then through the wide end of the grab link untilthe desired length is obtained.  Then the chain link thatis in the grab link is slipped past the spring keeper and6-13BOLTSPRINGNUTKEEPERKeeper bent orbroken.Bent.Burrs.NoneNone                                APEXweb ring.

Nylon Web Ring.  The nylon web ring has a maxi-mum capacity of 15,000 pounds.  Figure 6-18 shows thatthe web ring is held together by a connector link.  Acotton/nylon buffer, sewn on the inside of the nylon webstrap, helps prevent wear to the ring.  There are alsocotton/nylon buffers sewn to the inside of each end ofthe sling leg.  Figure 6-18 shows the four legs attachedto the web ring.  Notice how the nylon loops of the slingleg are positioned under the retainer strap to prevent thelegs from moving around the web ring.  b.  Nylon Sling Leg.  The maximum capacity of eachsling leg is 5,560 pounds.  Each sling leg is made from anylon web loop, 15 feet long, that is connected to itself                                                             connector linkby a connector link (Figure 6-19).

Inspection.  The unit can conduct its own inspec-tion.  Each nylon and chain multileg sling must be markedwith 1-inch  letters showing the date that the set wasfirst placed in use (Figure 6-23).  This means the firstday the sling is used, not the day of issue.  The markeddate is used in determining when the next required in-spection is due.  Although the slings are routinely in-spected before and after each use, they must be thor-oughly inspected every 6 months.(1)  If the sling is found satisfactory for further use,the old date is marked over and the new date applied.The date can be the calendar date or Julian date as shownin Figure 6-23.  The dates will be applied using eitherorange-yellow parachute marking ink, orange                                                                       tube-type marker, strata blue parachute marking ink, or stratablue tube-type marker.  If the old date was marked withstrata blue, mark over the area with strata blue ink andapply the new date using orange-yellow ink.  Do just theopposite if the old date was marked with orange-yellowink.  Only one date should appear on the sling.  An alter-nate method for recording the inspection date is to at-tach a metal tag to the sling set to identify the last in-spection date.     (2)  If the sling is unserviceable, stencil "unservice-able" on it and dispose of it through supply channels.The sling set is unserviceable if one of the followingdefects is found:(a)  Three or more consecutive broken and/or loosestitches (Figure 6-24).6-15Figure 6-20.  Grab Link with Spring Keeperinto the narrow                        end of the grab link.  The chain is heldin this position by the locking action of the chain linkson either side of the grab link and prevented from slip-ping out of the grab link by the spring keeper.  The leglength is determined by counting the number of linksfrom the free end of the chain and fastening this link inthe grab link.  e.  Making the Sling Set Fit the Load.   A completenylon and chain sling consists of four legs.  However,legs may be removed to make a two- or three-leggedsling (Figure 6-21).  The safe working capacity of atwo-, three-, and four-legged sling set is 11,120, 15,000and 15,000 pounds respectively.  The capacity of themultileg sling set is different from other sling sets be-cause of the sling leg design.  The six steps for adding orsubtracting a sling leg are as follows:FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2A6-16FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2A6-17FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2Aslings may be spot cleaned with a solution of 1/2 cup ofhand washing detergent dissolved in 1 gallon of warmwater.  Rinse the area thoroughly by repeating the pro-cedure with  fresh clean water and then let it air dry.  Donot wring out the area or try to heat the slings to reducedrying time.  This could damage the sling.  Remove allgrease, oil, rust, corrosion, or foreign matter on slingmetal parts by brushing or wiping them with a cloth orfine emery cloth.  File all burrs and sharp edges smooth.(3)  Storage.  Store the sling sets in a dry area pro-tected from direct sunlight, in a manner to prevent rust,corrosion, or contact with sharp abrasive objects and theground.i.  Quality Deficiency Report.  Anyone discovering adeficiency with the multileg sling set should submit SF368 to Commander, Defense Industrial Supply Center(Code DISC-OIBE/XC), Philadelphia, PA 19111.NOTE:  USMC should submit QDR in accordancewith MCO 4855.10.6-5.  40,000-POUND CAPACITY SLING SETThe Marine Corps and Navy heavy lift sling is the 40,000-pound capacity sling set.  The sling assembly consists ofthree major subassemblies: apex shackle, four Kevlarsling legs, and four grab links.  The chain section andcoupling are considered part of the sling leg subassem-bly.  Figure 6-26 shows one sling leg for clarity.NOTE: Due to low stretch characteristics, do not usethe 40,000-pound capacity sling set with the CH-47.However, one leg may be used as a vertical pendantwhen connected to a nylon sling and the load weighsless than 10,000 pounds.For detailed technical information on the 40,000-poundsling set, refer to USMC TM 3940-15/1, Operations andMaintenance, Sling, Multileg, Helicopter, External Lift,40,000-pound capacity.  a.  Apex Shackle Fitting.  The 40,000-pound capacitysteel apex shackle fitting holds the sling leg assembliesand attaches directly to the helicopter cargo hook (Fig-ure 6-27).  The apex fitting can be easily disassembledto allow for the removal or addition of sling legs as nec-essary.  The spacer helps to center the apex fitting onFigure 6-25.  Sling Leg Numbering Sequence for theMultileg Sling Set(1)  Repair.  Normal repair will consist of removaland replacement of damaged or defective components.Defective components will be removed from the slingassemblies and maintained at the unit supply until a com-plete unserviceable sling assembly is constructed forsurvey.  Components salvaged from damaged multilegsling assemblies will be inspected, and if found service-able, used to construct a serviceable sling.CAUTIONDo not attempt to repair any part of the sling,other than removal and replacement of com-ponents.(2)  Cleaning.  Spot clean the slings by gently brush-ing or rubbing the soiled area with a soft bristle brush orclean  cloth  dampened  with  dry  cleaning  solvent(tetrachloroethylene).  Rinse the soiled area by repeat-ing the procedure with more of the solvent and then al-low the sling to air dry.  Do not wring out the rinsedarea.  If dry cleaning solvent is not readily available, the6-18FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2Athe cargo hook.b.  Sling Leg Assembly.

Life Expectancy.  Active sling assemblies (thosein use) have a life expectancy of 5 years.  Inactive slingfastened              to the lower eye of the sling leg with a boltand spacer which are held in place by a castellated nutand cotter pin.  The bottom of the grab link has an eyethrough which a coupling link is inserted to attach thechain leg.  The length of the chain is varied by passingthe chain through the lifting provision, back through thecenter opening of the grab link, and inserting the chainlink that matches the desired leg length into the slot be-low the keeper.  The keeper is not a load bearing com-ponent, but only serves to keep the chain in the grab linkunder a no-load condition.  The chain leg is held in po-sition by the locking action of the chain link in the slotunder the grab link keeper.Figure 6-29.  Grab Link and Attached Chain Legassembles (those maintained in storage at Marine CorpsLogistics Base (MCLB)) have a life expectancy of 7years.  Sling assemblies issued to the Fleet Marine Force(FMF) from storage have a total life expectancy (stor-age plus active) of no more than 7 years.f.  Serialization.  Each 40,000-pound capacity slingset is assigned a serial number by the manufacturer.  Themanufacturer’s identification code and part number ispermanently marked on metal parts (except chain links)                       by etching, metal stamping, or raisedof the sling setcharacters.  Metal parts include the apex shackle, shacklepin and spacer, grab link, and coupling link.  The slinglegs  are  rubber  stamped  or  stenciled  with  themanufacturer’s identification code, part number, serialnumber, and date of manufacture.Figure 6-28.  Grab Link  d.  Chain Assembly.  The 8-foot chain assembly has70 links.  Starting from the free end, every tenth link ispainted olive drab to help in counting links.  If addi-tional lengths of chain are necessary, they can be joinedto the existing chain leg using a coupling link.  The chainlink identified in the rigging procedures is inserted inthe slot of the grab link (Figure 6-29).6-20FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2Ag.  Inspection.  Inspect all 40,000-pound capacity slingsets annually during their manufacture anniversary monthfor proper cleaning, storage, damage to components, anddefects or missing components.  Annual inspections andload testing will be conducted and recorded in accor-dance with USMC TM 3940-15/1.  Requirements forannual load testing of slings will be deleted based onmanufacturer’s testing requirements, life expectancy foractive and/or inactive sling assemblies, and because theonly authorized repair is by replacement of tested com-ponents.  Custodial commands have the option to ran-domly load test sling assemblies in accordance with MIL-S-29398 (USMC) and extend the life expectancy beyondthe 5 to 7 year time period, if deemed appropriate as aresult of inspections.h.  Maintenance.   If these sling assemblies are in-spected and maintained according to the requirementsof the damage and corrective action criteria listed inTable 6-3, there should be no fear of dropping a slingload through failure of the slings or components.  Thirdechelon level of repairs are authorized in the field at theGeneral  Support  Maintenance  Company  (GSM  Co),Force Service Support Group (FSSG) by replacement ofcomponents or entire assembly (Appendix B) obtainablethrough the Marine Corps Logistics Base (Code 838-2),Albany, GA 31704.i.  Preventive Maintenance Checks.   Before and af-ter using the sling set, check metal parts for rust, corro-sion, cracks, bends, distortions, burrs, sharp edges, andsigns of wear and tear.  Look for dirt, grease, oil, andany other foreign matter on the components.  Clean, pro-tect, and properly store the sling set when it is not inuse.  See USMC TM 3940-15/1 for detailed informationon preventive maintenance checks and services, storage,and surveying procedures.j.  Maintenance Materials and Procedures.   Proce-dures and materials used for field maintenance of thesling set are as follows:(1)    Use  a  brass-bristle  wire  brush  to  clean  apexshackle and grab link.(2)  Use mild detergent to clean sling assembly.(3)  Rinse thoroughly and air dry to protect metalparts.(4)  Use lubricating oil to protect metal parts.(5)  Use polyolefin preservative to protect sling legs.k.  Storage.  After performing preventive maintenancechecks and necessary cleaning, place the sling assemblyin a sturdy container and store in a dry area away fromdirect sunlight.CAUTIONKeep the sling set away from direct sunlightduring storage.  The polyolefin sling leg coverprotects the sling leg from ultraviolet light.Ultraviolet light will weaken the Kevlar fi-bers.  Always ensure that the polyolefin slingleg cover is complete and damage free.  l.  Quality Deficiency Report.  Anyone finding a defi-ciency in the 40,000-pound sling set should submit anSF 368 to CG, Marine Corps Logistics Base (Code 838-2), Albany, GA 31704.NOTE: USMC should submit QDR in accordancewith MCO 4855.10.6-6.  NYLON FLAT-WEB SLINGSNOTE:  The Type X family of aerial deliveryslings are being phased out of sling load use.Effective 1 January 1998 Type X nylon slingswill not be authorized for use on sling loads.The Multi-loop Line, Type XXVI aerial de-livery sling is the authorized replacement.Currently, two types of nylon flat-web slings used to rigloads for airdrop may also be used to rig loads for slingload.  They are the Type X nylon aerial delivery slingsand their replacement, the Type XXVI nylon multilooplines.  Appendix H is a listing of flat-web slings used toaerial deliver Tactical Air Command shelter systems.NOTE:  Army units are encouraged not to rig slingloads using flat-web slings but rather use the 10,000-or 25,000-pound capacity sling sets due to greater re-liability and ease in rigging.6-21FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2ATable 6-3.

Slings are attached tothe loads using one of the following methods:(1)  The most common form of load attachment isthe sling-to-clevis (vertical hitch) attachment shown inFigure 6-31.  This method is preferred because it is thequickest and easiest to remove.a.  Type X Nylon Aerial Delivery Slings.   The 1 3/4-inch Type X aerial delivery slings are manufacturedin 3-, 8-, 9- 11-, 12-, 16-, and 20-foot lengths.  Eachaerial delivery sling is constructed with two, three, orfour concentric loops.   Due to revised safety factors,when using the aerial delivery slings for rigging a slingload, the maximum rated capacity for two-, three-, andfour-loop slings is 3,500, 5,250, and 7,000 pounds, re-spectively.WARNINGUSING TYPE X AERIAL DELIVERY FLAT-WEBSLINGS AS PENDANTS IS PROHIBITED.  REFERTO  CHAPTER  8  FOR  APPROVED  VERTICALPENDANTS.b.  Type XXVI Nylon Multi-loop Lines.   The TypeXXVI nylon multi-loop lines are available in 3-, 9-, 11,12-, 16-, and 20-foot lengths (Figure 6-30).  Each multi-loop line is constructed of two or four concentric loops.Three- or six-loop 60-foot and two- or six-loop 120-footType XXVI nylon multi-loop lines are also available.See Appendix B for NSN information.Figure 6-31.  Sling-to-Clevis Attachment (VerticalHitch)(2)  The basket hitch (Figure 6-32) attaches sling legsto the load or to the ring.  It is easy to remove this hitch6-25FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2Aload.  Do not use a choker hitch around an item with acircumference of less than 8 inches or a diameter smallerthan 2 1/2 inches.  The uneven tension placed on thesling when a choker hitch is used around smaller diam-eter items, such as a lifting ring, may cause sling failure.The disadvantage of this hitch is that it draws up tightlyand is difficult to remove.The completed sling set is made up of sling legs and a 3-foot sling (ring) (Figure 6-35).  The sling legs reach fromthe lifting points on the load to the apex ring.  Eachsling leg may be one or more sling leg segments.Figure 6-35.  Three-Foot Apex Ring(1)  The apex ring joins the slings to form the slingapex and attaches the slings to the helicopter cargo hook.The apex ring is made by joining the two ends of a 3-foot sling with either a Type IV connector link (Figure6-36) or a two-point link assembly (Figure 6-37).  Anapex ring made from a three-loop Type X nylon or two-loop Type XXVI nylon sling has a maximum capacityof 10,000 pounds.  When two apex rings are used to-gether, the two apex rings have a combined maximumcapacity of 17,500 pounds.  Use the 10,000-pound ca-pacity sling set apex fitting with the aluminum spacer toattach the apex ring to the UH-60 cargo hook.Figure 6-33.  Choker Hitchd.  Rigging a Load.  The type and quantity of slingsused to rig loads vary with the weight and configurationof the load to be lifted.  Figure 6-34 shows a four-leggednylon sling.Figure 6-34.  Four-Legged Nylon Sling6-26Figure 6-36.  Type IV Connector LinkFM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2Alifting the rigged load with a hoisting device (for ex-ample, a wrecker truck or a truck-mounted crane).  Thistest would have the same effect, except for drag, as thatof having the load lifted by a helicopter.  Unless stan-dardized rigging procedures are available to the riggingpersonnel (such as those in FM 55-450-4/FMFRP 5-31,VOL  II/NWP  42-1,  VOL  I/AFR  50-16,  VOL  I/COMDTINST M13482.3 and FM 55-450-5/FMFRP 5-31, VOL III/NWP 42-1, VOL III/AFR 50-16, VOL III/COMDTINST M13482.4), it is advisable that the sus-pension-attitude test be run on all sling loads that couldpossibly create an undesirable suspension attitude.(4)  When rigging vehicles, the desired attitude ofload suspension is normally “nose low” for prime mov-ers, towed loads, and coupled vehicles (prime mover withtrailer).(5)  When rigging the load, make one complete twistof the sling for each 3 feet of sling length.  The twiststend to hold the sling loops together better, which keepsthe slings from flapping in the wind and setting up avibration that could cause damage.  Hitches should bemade as small and neat as possible.(6)  To prevent damage to slings during helicoptersling load operations, any sling connected next to or rest-ing against an abrasive surface should be wrapped withpadding or cushioning material (such as felt sheets orcellulose padding).  Secure the padding to the sling withtape or nylon cord (Figure 6-38).Figure 6-38.  Padding the Sling Leg(7)  Sling legs should be taped or tied together (break-away technique) to prevent fouling or entanglement ofthe slings during hookup.  Pressure-sensitive tape or6-27Figure 6-37.  Two-Point Link Assembly(2)  The four-loop Type XXVI nylon multi-loop lineis too large for the Type IV connector link.  Use a two-point link assembly to join the two ends of a four-loopType XXVI nylon multi-loop line together.  An apexring made from a four-loop Type XXVI nylon sling andtwo-point  link  has  a  maximum  capacity  of  25,000-pounds.  A 25,000-pound capacity web ring, similar tothe web ring on the 15,000-pound capacity multileg slingset, can also be used as the apex fitting.  Use cautionwhen rigging a load with nylon flat-web slings becausefew standardized procedures are available.  Generally,the nearer a load’s sling leg arrangement approaches anequilateral triangle, the better the load suspension.  Thesling legs should be of the shortest feasible length be-cause:(a)  The flight characteristics of a helicopter with aparticular load can be improved by having the load sus-pended closer to the underside of the helicopter.(b)  Supply economy of slings may be an opera-tional factor.(3)  Generally, the length of each sling leg is ad-justed as necessary to assure that the load maintains anacceptable attitude when lifted.  Since the center of bal-ance of a load suspended from a single point will alwaysfall directly below the suspension point, the initial rig-ging of a particular load might result in the load’s tiltingto an unacceptable degree at lift-off.  It may be neces-sary, therefore, to test the attitude of load suspension byFM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2A  e.  Inspection, Maintenance, and Storage.   The twoends of each loop of nylon flat-web slings are sewn to-gether.   Figure 6-39 illustrates the sewn splice and howto inspect for broken or loose stitches.  Use the require-ments and criterion of the 15,000-pound multileg slingset when marking, inspecting, cleaning, and storing theaerial delivery slings and multiloop lines.6-28FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2ACHAPTER 7CARGO NETSTHIS CHAPTER IMPLEMENTS STANAG 29507-1.  INTRODUCTIONThis chapter covers the flat-web nylon cargo net, alongwith the 5,000- and 10,000-pound capacity knotless ny-lon cord cargo nets.  These nets are used to carry sup-plies, equipment, and loose cargo.  The characteristicsof each net are discussed in detail.7-2.  FLAT-WEB NYLON CARGO NETThe flat-web nylon cargo net was designed to carry loosecargo when loading or offloading ships.  It was not de-signed nor tested for helicopter sling loading, althoughit is commonly used during sling load operations.  Thenet weighs 50 pounds and has a flat surface area mea-suring 14 feet x 14 feet.  The mesh size is 8 inches square.A 10 foot x 10 foot and 12 foot x 12 foot net are alsoavailable.  The rated capacity of the net is 2,500 pounds(Figure 7-1), downgraded from 4,500 pounds due to anincreased safety margin.  The net has four steel hoistlinks with one link attached to each corner of the net.  A7-foot loop of nylon rope may be attached to each linkto help the riggers spread out the net.  Refer to Chapter 9when using the net during vertical replenishment opera-tions.  It is important to position the load diagonally at a45-degree angle to the sides                                            of the net so that thecorners of the net are positioned at the sides of the load.Rig the net using the following procedures:• Spread the net evenly on the ground or other flat sur-face.  If the load has sharp edges that could damage thenet, place a piece of canvas on the net so the load cannotshift and tear the net.• Place the heavier items of cargo in the center of thenet so that the net will ride evenly.• Arrange the cargo so the net covers at least three-Figure 7-1.  Flat-Web Nylon Cargo Netfourths of the height on all sides of a single item or theentire height of a mixed load.  • Tie the net around the top of the cargo with nyloncord (Figure 7-2) or other material by routing the cordthrough the net mesh.  Tighten and secure the cord toprevent the net from hanging loose and cargo fallingout.• Use one, two, or four sling legs to suspend the loadednet below the helicopter.  Loop the chain end of the slingleg through one or more steel hoist links and insert link3 into the grabhook/grab link.  • If one sling leg is used, loop the chain end through allfour hoist links.  If two sling legs are used, loop eachchain through two steel hoist links.  If four sling legs areused, loop one chain through each steel hoist link.  Re-member, do not exceed the rated capacity of the slingleg.7-1FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2AFigure 7-2.  Rigging A Loaded Net7-2FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2A7-3FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2ANOTE:  When carrying loads that are not palletized,it is suggested that you weave the top portion of theborder cord with 550-pound nylon cord to preventitems from failing out of the net (weave and tie).Follow these instructions when rigging the net:(1)  Spread the net out on the ground.  Have fourpersons pull evenly on each of the four lifting legs toopen the net to its fullest extension over the spot wherethe net is to be loaded (Figure 7-5).  This will preventthe net from shifting under the pallets or load when thehelicopter lifts the net.(2)  Inspect the net.  Repair as necessary.  Inspect thepallet or load and make sure that the banding materialand pallet frame will not puncture, cut, or tear the net.Tape over sharp edges with pressure-sensitive tape.NOTE:  When forklifts are used to move pallets ontothe nets, move the lifting legs to one side so that theywill not be damaged by the tires.  Do not allow thepallet or the undercarriage of the forklift forks to dragon the net surface.  The forklift forks could tear thenet and pull it out from under the load.  If the net ispulled out, the load may not be centered or could beunstable in flight.(3)  Align the load on the net so that the sides of theload are parallel with the yellow cord (Figure 7-6).  Theload may overlap the yellow cord if the load is biggerthan the yellow cord marked area.  If the load is placed7-4FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2AIf the load is small, you may have to tape or tie the nettogether above the load.  The tighter the net is aroundthe load, the less possibility there is of damage to thenet.  Tape or tie the legs and net so that the net does notsnag on the load as the helicopter lifts the net (Figure 7-9).  Use breakaway technique so that the tape or tie canbreak after the slack is removed from the legs and net.Figure 7-7.  Legs Hooked in SequenceFigure 7-9.  Taping Lifting Legs     (7)  Lift the sides of the net up while taping the legsso that the net does not get caught on the pallet or loadprotrusions (Figure 7-10).Figure 7-8.  Taped Hookson top of the load hold the apex up and another persontape or tie all 16 lifting legs together at 3- to 4-foot in-tervals until no more slack can be pulled up on the legs.7-5FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2A(8)  After you finish taping the legs and net on top ofthe load, pull the net outward at each corner, grasp theborder cord from each side near the corner of the load,and tape them together to tighten the sides of the net.Take the excess netting at the corner and tape to theadjoining side.  At each side, pull the net up as high aspossible and tape it to itself to prevent it from snaggingon the load and tearing the net (Figure 7-11). Use onlyenough tape to hold the net in place on the load.  DONOT tape the net to the load.Figure 7-12.  Lifting Legs Coiled on Top of LoadFigure 7-11.  Excess Net Taped to Itself(9)  Coil the lifting legs on top of the load.  The net isnow ready for hookup to the helicopter (Figure 7-12).  Ifthe load must be moved after it is rigged, carefully guidethe forklift forks through the net and into the pallet slots.Pallets can be stored temporarily with nets rigged aroundthem.  However, they should not be stored on concrete.Placing an empty pallet on the concrete surface and set-ting the rigged net on top of the empty pallet helps toreduce the possibility of damage from the net sliding onthe concrete when the helicopter lifts the load.(10)  Normally the net apex fitting is directly attachedto the cargo hook.  If the load is a large one, the liftinglegs may not be long enough to allow the hookup manto perform a safe hookup to the aircraft.  If you cannotlift the apex fitting at least 6 feet above the top of theload, add a reach or vertical pendant (Figure 7-13).Remember, the capacity of the vertical pendant must begreater than the weight of the load.7-6Figure 7-13.  Adding a Vertical Pendant(11)  Before hookup to the aircraft, make a final in-spection of the apex fitting, netting, and taping to en-sure the net and the load are still secure.c.  Repairing the Nets.   All repairs will be accom-plished according to procedures in TM 10-1670-295-23&P.7-4.    PLACING  ALL  NETTED  LOADS  FORPICKUPLoads for sling load pickup should be arranged in theFM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2Alanding site for ease of pickup.  Loads should be placedon level ground, away from obstacles (see Chapter 4),and prearranged for the type of aircraft being used.  Mul-tiple net loads can be carried up to the helicopter’s capa-bility.  If a sling set is used to carry a cargo net, route thesling chain through the net apex fitting, and insert link 3in the sling grabhook.  Remember that the weight of theload determines the number of sling legs attached to eachnet.  Figure 7-14 shows how more than one 5,000-poundcargo net could be carried by a 25,000-pound sling set.The weight of the load must not exceed the capacity ofthe sling leg(s).  For example, a fully loaded 10,000-pound cargo net can be carried by all four sling legsfrom a 10,000-pound sling set or two sling legs from a25,000-pound sling set.NOTE:  When using an aircraft equipped with mul-tiple cargo hooks, several combinations of slings andnets may be used depending on the situation.  Makesure the loads will fit under the helicopter.  Load os-cillation will cause the loads to bump against eachother if they are too close.  If you are unsure of howto arrange the loads in the landing site, contact thesupporting aviation unit operations department/sec-tion for additional7-7FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2ACHAPTER 8A-22 CARGO BAG, PALLET SLINGS, PENDANTS, AND SUPPLEMENTAL EQUIPMENT8-1.  INTRODUCTIONThis chapter discusses the components of an A-22 cargobag, pallet slings, sling leg pendants, and their riggingprocedures.  It also discusses equipment used with slingsand other lifting devices.8-2.  A-22 CARGO BAGThe A-22 cargo bag is an adjustable cotton duck cloth/nylon and nylon webbing container consisting of a slingassembly, cover, and four suspension webs (Figure 8-1).The bag is used to aerial deliver palletized loads, loosecargo,  ammunition,  drums,  and  other  general  cargo.Maximum weight capacity is 2,200 pounds.  The weightof the A-22 is 58 pounds.  You may rig the cargo in thebag with or without the cover. Inspect the container forserviceability in accordance with Table 2-1, PreventiveMaintenance Checks and Services, in TM 10-1670-298-20&P.  The best way to learn about this carrying deviceis to rig and derig it several times.  The following stepsand Figures 8-2 through 8-6 explain how to rig an A-22cargo bag:   a.  Sling Assembly.  Spread the sling assembly on theground near the cargo to be aerial delivered.  Make surethe lateral straps are facing the ground.  The fat lip por-tion of the friction adapter on the suspension web assem-bly must be face down to ensure correct rigging whenthe cover and suspension assembly are folded up aroundthe load.   b.  Cover Assembly.  Center the cover (lacing loops/eyelets down) on the sling assembly, making sure thatthe cover edges are even with the scuff pad of the sus-pension web assembly.   c.  Positioning the Load.   Center the load on the can-vas/nylon cover (Figure 8-2).  Place the load so that anysharp corners or objects are toward the center of                                                                            theload if possible.  Use cushioning material to protect thecover, if necessary.Figure 8-2.  Centered Load   d.  Closing the Cover.  Fold the panels of the canvas/nylon cover over the top of the load.  Fold any excesscover material under the top flap.  Using lacing cord orType III nylon cord, secure the cover at each corner byrunning the cord through the lacing loops in a figure-eight design (Figure 8-3).  Tie the cord ends with a bowknot and secure.  The purpose of the cord is to tighten thecover around the load so that small items cannot fall out.8-1Figure 8-1.  A-22 Cargo BagFM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2Athe sling assembly D-rings.  Make sure the open or hookside of each snap is facing inward.  Tape each snap toprevent the hooks from becoming entangled on the ny-lon cord or straps.Figure 8-3.  Securing the Cover with Lacing Cord  e.  Closing the Sling Assembly.   Route the 188-inchstrap over top of the load.  Route the free end under thefloating safety bar (smooth side) and back over the fric-tion adapter (rough side).  Tighten the strap, fold in 4 to5 inch loops, and secure (Figure 8-4).Figure 8-5.  Fastening Upper Lateral Straps  g.  Attaching  the Suspension Clevis.   Attach the foursuspension web strap D-rings to a medium clevis in aclockwise sequence.  Tape the nut with pressure sensi-tive tape.  Each strap can have a                                                 maximum of one twistto connect to the clevis (Figure 8-6).Figure 8-4.  Securing the StrapPull the lower lateral straps to the corners of the load.Route the free end under the floating bar and back overthe friction adapter.  Attempt to tighten all four lowerlateral straps equally.  Repeat this step using the middlelateral straps.  Fasten the upper lateral straps in the samemanner as in Figure 8-5.  If the load is not high enoughfor the upper lateral straps to go around the side of theload, pull the suspension webs to their full height andfasten the upper straps diagonally across the top cornerof the load.  Strap fasteners should be tightened to within4 to 5 inches of the upper lifting legs.  f.  Attaching the Suspension Webs.   Connect the foursnap fasteners on the 24-inch suspension web straps to8-2Figure 8-6.  Upper Sling and Medium ClevisFM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2A  h.  Adjusting the Lateral Straps.   Adjust all strapsuntil the sling assembly fits snugly around the load.  Foldand secure any excess webbing.  i.  Preparing the Load for Pickup.   Prepare the loadfor pickup by looping the chain end of a sling leg throughthe medium clevis and inserting link number 3 in slinggrabhook.  Several A-22 cargo bags can be carried at thesame time (Figure 8-7).  Secure the bags together with atemporary tie of Type III nylon cord around the upperlateral straps of each container at the inside corner wherethey meet.  Attach slings or sling legs to each containerthrough the medium clevis.  Adjust the sling leg lengthsso that all the bags are carried at the same level.  Usu-ally link number 3 is placed in the grabhook.  This willmake pickup and release easier since all loads will leavethe ground at the same time.  To derig the A-22 cargobag, remove the sling legs and clevis assemblies.  Untieor cut the taped or tied strings.  Unfasten the web strapsand spread out the cover.Figure 8-7.  Load of Three A-22 Cargo Bags8-3.  PALLET SLINGSA  pallet  sling  has  a  4,000-pound  carrying  capacity,weighs about 14 pounds, and carries a standard 40- x48-inch  pallet  (Figure  8-8).    The  two  most  commonmodels of pallet slings are the Mk100 and the Mk86.The only diference between the two is how high you canstack the cargo on the pallet.  The Mkl00 carries a palletwith a load height of 48 to 70 inches and the Mk86 car-ries a pallet with a load 29 to 40 inches high.  Figure 8-8 identifies the parts of a pallet sling.  Become familiarwith each part and where it is located.                                                             The tubing onthe cable between the two lifting eyes is color coded toidentify the pallet model; black designates the Mk86 andyellow designates the Mkl00.NOTE: Make sure the load extends at least to theedge of the pallet wing.  If the load does not extend tothe end of the pallet, the cable lifting on the unsup-ported board ends may cause the boards to break re-sulting in loss of the load.  a.  Rigging Pallet Slings.   Take the following stepswhen using a pallet sling to carry a load:NOTE:  Wear leather gloves when handling the cableto protect your hands.     (1)  Place the bridle across the load perpendicular tothe pallet boards and parallel to the pallet wings.     (2)  Route the plastic covered wire rope under thepallet wing formed by the upper boards on the sides ofthe pallet.  Pull the ends of the cable containing the swagestops through the tensioner (Figure 8-9).     (3)  Feed the swage stops (adjusting beads) on thecable basket leg through the tensioner to tighten the plas-tic covered wire ropes against the underside of both pal-let     wings.  Keep the bridle centered on top of the load.     (4)  Snap shut the latch bar on the tensioner stirrupwhile  keeping  the  basket  leg  tight  against  the  palletwings.CAUTIONPosition the plastic covered wire ropes tightlyunder the pallet wings.  If they are not underthe pallet wings, the pallet sling could slip offthe pallet when it is lifted.  Secure the cargoto the pallet to prevent any of the items fromsliding off in flight.8-3FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2A8-4FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2ACAUTIONThe last swage on the end of the basket leg(wire rope leg) is a safety stop and must notbe used for adjustment.  Two pallets may becarried at one time using all four legs of  thesling set as shown in Figure 8-11.Figure 8-11. Multipallet Load  b.  Cleaning and Lubricating Pallet Slings.   To cleanand lubricate Mk86 and Mk100 pallet slings, you needfresh water, a wire brush, dry cleaning solvent (P-D-680), clean rags, and lubricating grease and oil.  Step bystep procedures are as follows:    (1)  Remove salt residue and other foreign matterfrom tensioners, tubing, and fittings with water or sol-vent, if necessary.    (2)  Clean exposed areas of wire rope using awire brush.  Make sure all foreign matter and lubricantsare removed from the valleys between the standards andthe spaces between outer wires.    (3)  Apply at least three drops of oil to the pivotareas, spring, and locking detent.  Wipe off any excessoil.  Exercise latches when lubricating to distribute lu-bricant.     (4)  Lubricate exposed areas of wire rope.NOTE: Lubrication should be thin enough to pen-etrate the strands to the core, but not so thin as to runoff the rope or not so thick that it merely covers therope.(5)  Store the sling hanging up off the ground.  c.  Inspecting Pallet Slings.   Inspect pallet slings be-fore using and after exposure to salt water spray.  Alsoinspect inactive pallet slings every 6 months.  Use leathergloves  to  protect  your  hands  from  any  broken  wirestrands.  Perform the inspection by following these steps:     (1)  Verify that the following test data is stenciled onequipment or etched on the metal test tag attached toequipment:      (a)  Testing facility.      (b)  Safe working load.(c)  Date tested.    (2)  Verify that the date tested is within past 18months.    (3)  Inspect plastic tubing on basket legs fortears, cracks, and deterioration.    (4)  Inspect rubber or plastic tubing on bridlefor cracks and deterioration.  Verify that color coding iscorrect.    (5)  Inspect each swage stop for cracks, deforma-tion, and looseness.     (6)  Engage and release both tensioners on aminimum of three different swage stops.  Verify that:      (a)  Latches function easily.(b)  Latches lock firmly.      (c)  Some effort is required to unlock latches.    (7)  Inspect wire rope and fittings for:      (a)  Outside wires worn to approximately one-half their original diameter.8-5FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2A8-6FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2A  c.  Inspection.  Inspect the reach pendants BEFOREAND AFTER use.  Check for cuts and tears in the ny-lon-urethane plastic sheath on each loop.  If the whitestrength member (3rd layer) is visible, remove the pen-dant from service.  d.  Cleaning.  Clean the reach pendant with a mixtureof warm water and mild dish or laundry detergent. Oiland grease may be removed by using varsol or mineralspirits.  The top and bottom eyes may be treated withsilicone spray.  Do not use silicone spray on the reachtube.CAUTIONDo not use chemical cleaners on  reach pen-dants.  Chemicals may weaken the strengthmembers of the pendant.  If a pendant be-comes contaminated with chemicals, removeit from service.  e.  Storage.  Store reach pendants in a clean, dry areaout of direct sunlight.  Prolonged exposure to sunlightwill deteriorate the strength of reach pendants.8-5.  VERTICAL PENDANTSRoundslings, sling legs, and Type XXVI nylon aerialdelivery equipment (ADE) slings  used as vertical pen-dants are used in some helicopter sling load operationsto increase the clearance between the helicopter and theload.  These pendants are helpful  in situations whereblowing dust/snow, tall surrounding obstacles, or reducedvisibility impairs the aircrew’s ability to see the loadand/or hookup team.  Vertical pendants are used betweenthe helicopter hook and the sling set used to rig the loador the load itself.  Vertical pendants differ from pen-dants provided by the aviation unit (refer to Figure 2-1)in that the vertical  pendants do not have a supplementalreleasable swivel hook that allows the aircrew to release                                                                            pen-the load without dropping the pendant.  Verticaldants also differ from reach pendants  in that no rigidportion is provided to assist in ground hookup.  Itemsused for vertical pendants in order of preference are thepolyester roundsling, sling legs from the 10,000-poundand  25,000-pound  sling  sets,  and  Type  XXVI  ADEslings. a.  Polyester Roundslings.   Polyester roundslings areused  as  the  primary  vertical  pendant  (Figure  8-13).Roundslings can be attached to the load using the threehitches described in Chapter 6.  The lifting capacity ofpolyester roundslings vary with the size of the sling andthe type of hitch used to attach the load.  Each sling hastwo identification tags permanently sewn to the eye andeye sleeve identifying the size and capacity, as well asother important  information necessary for the safe useof roundslings. These slings are also color coded to des-ignate the size of the sling.  Refer to Table 8-1 for slinglengths and lift capacities.    (1)  Inspection.  Inspect the polyester roundsling be-fore and after each use. Remove the roundsling fromservice if any of the following are found:      (a)  Both identification tags are missing or are notreadable.      (b)  Acid or alkali burns.       (c)  Melting, charring or weld splatter of any part ofthe roundsling.      (d)  Holes, tears, cuts, snags, embedded particles,or abrasive wear that exposes the core fibers.(e)  Broken or worn stitching in the cover that ex-poses the core fibers.       (f)  Knots in any part of the roundsling.      (g)  Distortion, excessive pitting, corrosion or bro-ken fitting(s).(h)  Any condition which causes doubt as to thestrength of the roundsling.CAUTIONDo not drag roundslings on the floor or overrough  sufaces.    Do  not  twist  or  joinroundslings together using knots.    (2)  Storage.  Store roundslings in a clean, dry,8-7FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2ATable 8-1.  Safe working loads for Polyester RoundslingsPART NO.

Prolonged exposure tosunlight will deteriorate the strength of roundslings.b.  10,000- and 25,000-Pound Capacity Sling Sets.Each nylon rope sling leg has stored energy because thenylon rope stretches when carrying a load.  If the liftingprovision on the load, or the sling leg itself, were to break,this stored energy would cause the sling leg to reboundupward and possibly damage the helicopter.  Thereforewhenever possible, avoid connecting single sling legstogether end to end.  If your situation requires more thanone sling leg length, join pairs of sling legs side by sideusing a sling set apex fitting instead of just single slinglegs connected end to end.  The safe working load ca-pacities of a sling leg from a 10,000- or 25,000-poundcapacity sling set when used as a vertical pendant are3,800 and 7,500 pounds, respectively.  Sling legs in asling set are generally routed at an angle from the liftingprovision to the apex fitting.  The resultant force on thesling leg is a combination of both vertical and horizon-tal forces.  The maximum safe working load of the slinglegs in a sling set, identified in Chapter 6, is based uponthe maximum sling leg angle permitted.  Since the slingleg pendant is only used in a vertical direction, the maxi-mum capacity of a sling leg pendant is greater than theFM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2Amaximum capacity of the same sling leg when used asone of the sling legs in a sling set.  This section containsrigging and safe working capabilities of sling legs thatare used as vertical pendants.  Do not confuse the slingcapacities in this section with the capacities of the slinglegs in Chapter 6. Chapter 6 contains rigging and safeworking capacity information for the sling legs whenused as a part of a sling set.  c.  Nylon and Chain Multileg Sling Set.   The nylonstrap portion of the sling leg does not stretch as much asa nylon rope sling leg.  Single legs from the multilegsling set can be connected end to end using a large cle-vis (MS 70087-3) or a Type IV link connector.  Eachsling leg, when used as a vertical pendant, has a safeworking load capacity of 8,800 pounds.    d.    Flat-Web  Nylon  Slings.    Type  XXVI  nylonmultiloop aerial delivery slings are discussed in this sec-tion.  A colored thread, stitched lengthwise down themiddle of the strap, identifies the strap as a Type XXVInylon multiloop line.     (1)   Use a Type IV link connector or large clevis(MS 70087-3) to join the ends of  two-loop Type XXVInylon multiloop lines.     (2)  Multiloop lines that are made of three or moreloops will not fit in the Type IV link connector.  Instead,use a 5 1/2-inch, two-point link to join the ends together.The 5 1/2-inch, two-point link has a safe working loadcapacity of 12,500 pounds.  Therefore, the safe workingload capacity of any sling leg pendant using a two-pointlink cannot exceed 12,500 pounds.     (3)  The Type IV link connector has a maximum safeworking load capacity of 12,500 pounds.  Therefore thesafe working load capacity of any sling leg pendant us-ing     a Type IV link connector cannot exceed 12,500pounds.     (4)  Safe working load capacities for Type XXVInylon multiloop lines when used as vertical pendantsare shown in Table 8-2.8-6.

Tape.  Pressure-sensitive tape is used to hold looseequipment in place and also to provide temporary re-straint that will break away when the load is lifted offthe ground.  Do not use tape as a load bearing item.  Ifyou want to form a piece of tape into a string to tie to-gether, just fold a piece of tape lengthwise.  The tapeshould be woven cloth tape (duct tape), pressure-sensi-tive, waterproof, and at least 2 inches wide.  The tapehas a breaking strength of 80 pounds.  Some of the mostcommon applications of tape are as follows:       (1)  Several wraps of tape are used to gather to-gether and hold the sling legs on top of the load after thesling is attached to the load and before it is hooked up tothe helicopter.  This breakaway technique taping reducesthe risk of the sling legs becoming entangled duringhookup.  The tape will break, freeing the sling legs dur-ing the lifting operation.       (2)  To prevent loose chain ends from whippingand damaging equipment.       (3)  To attach protective padding to slings or theload itself.       (4)  To secure chain loop or sling legs in place be-fore load is lifted.8-9FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2A  b.  Cotton Webbing.   Cotton webbing is used as analternative to pressure-sensitive tape.  The 1/4-inch wideType I cotton webbing (Figure 8-14) is rated at 80 poundsbreaking strength.  Cotton webbing is also used to com-bine and hold the legs of the cargo sling on top of theload after the sling legs are attached.  Once tension isapplied to the sling, the webbing will break, freeing thesling legs for normal weight-carrying configuration.  Thisbreakaway technique reduces the risk of the sling legsfouling on the load during hookup and lift-off.chain to pass through the lifting points.  Large, medium,small, and small screw-pin clevises may be used in slingload operations.CAUTIONThe nut and bolt assemblies of different sizedclevises are not interchangeable.  See Appen-dix B for bolt and nut NSNs for each clevisassembly.     (1)  Large Clevis.   The large clevis (Figure 8-15)can be used to lift a load that weighs up to 12,500 poundsif it has only one attachment point.  If the load has fourattachment points and a large clevis is used at each lift-                                             weight that can be lifteding point, the maximum loadis 31,500 pounds.  If the load has two or three attach-ment points, the maximum load weight is 15,750 and23,625 pounds, respectively.  The large clevis is oftenused as a junction point when suspending an accompa-nying load under a howitzer.  The large clevis uses a 1-inch bolt and nut.Figure 8-15.  Large Clevis Assembly (Part No.MS 70087-3)     (2)  Medium Clevis.   This clevis (Figure 8-16) canlift single lift point loads up to a maximum weight of6,250 pounds.  It also can be used to attach sling legs ofa four-legged sling set to a load weighing up to 15,000pounds.  If the load has two or three attachment points,the maximum load weight is 7,500 and 11,250 pounds,respectively.  It is commonly used to join the four sus-pension web straps on the A-22 cargo bag.  The mediumclevis has a 3/4-inch bolt and nut.Figure 8-14.  1/4-Inch Cotton Webbing  c.  Nylon Cord.  Type III nylon cord has a breakingstrength of 550 pounds.  Because of its high breakingstrength, nylon cord is not used in situations that requirethe breakaway technique.  Nylon cord is used to secureloose equipment, padding, and excess chain.  d.  Protective Padding.   To prevent chafing damageto equipment during sling load operations, any chain endof a sling connected to or  resting against the lightweight                            piece of equipment should be wrap-metal surface of aped with padding to prevent damage.  The padding isalso wrapped around the nylon portion of the sling legsand taped or tied to protect the legs from sharp objectswhich could damage the sling legs or cause fusing ormelting of the nylon due to friction.  The padding mayalso be secured to the load to prevent damage.  Cellu-lose  padding  is  commonly  used  and  recommended.Cellulose, however, can easily be damaged by water.Felt sheeting may also be used as padding.  Other mate-rials may be used, such as rags and inner tubes, but theymust be able to withstand rotor wash and wind duringflight.  e.  Clevises.  Clevises may be used to rig equipmentthat does not have lifting shackles attached to the liftingprovisions or lifting provisions not large enough for the8-10FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2Aof several sizes of anchor shackels are listed in Table 8-3.  The capacity of the anchor shackle is marked on theshackle.Figure 8-16.  Medium Clevis Assembly (Part No.MS 70087-2)     (3)  Small Clevis.  The most common use of the smallclevis (Figure 8-17) is on the M151 truck wheel hubs.The maximum load weight that can be lifted using asmall clevis at the ends of a four-legged sling set is 15,000pounds.  If the load has two or three attachment points,the maximum load weight is 7,500 and 11,250 pounds,respectively.  The small clevis can also be used to lift aload that weighs up to 6,250 pounds if it has only oneattachment point.  The small clevis is identified by a 5/8-inch bolt and nut.Figure 8-17.  Small Clevis Assembly (Part No.  MS70087-1)     (4)  Anchor Shackles  (Figure 8-18).  Anchor shack-les are used to attach sling legs to equipment that doesnot have shackles attached to the lift provisions.  Afterinstalling the shackle, place the nut on the bolt and  safetythe nut with the cotter pin.  This keeps  the pin frombacking out in flight.  The safe working load capacitiesFigure 8-18.  Anchor Shackles  f.  15-Foot Tie-Down Strap.   The 15-foot tie-downstrap is made of 1 3/4-inch wide Type X or Type XVcotton webbing with a D-ring at one end.  The cargo tie-down straps are used with quick-fit strap                                                           fasteners andload binders to secure bulk or palletized cargo makingup a single load or for lashing cargo to a vehicle.  g.  Quick-Fit Strap Fasteners.   The quick-fit strapfasteners are fitted on the strap’s free ends.  Load bind-ers attach the strap fastener to an attachment point.  Eachfastener consists of a metal fitting forged in a V-shapewith a double bar and a friction grip crossbar.  Usually,load binders are used to tighten a tie-down strap that ispassed through, around, or over cargo items.  When loadbinders are not available, the quick-fit strap fastener canbe used for this purpose.                                         The procedure for using thequick-fit strap fastener is outlined in the followingsteps:     (1)  Pass the free end of the 15-foot strap around orthrough the first fitting or fixture (or through its own D-ring) and pull it tight.      (2)  Pass the free end of the strap between the lowerdouble bar and friction grip crossbar of the strap fas-tener, then around or through the second fitting or fix-ture.     (3)  Pass the free end of the strap back between thelower double bar and friction grip crossbar of the strapfastener.8-11FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2ATable 8-3.

The load binder (Figure 8-19) is alocking device which is used to tighten and secure lash-ing straps.  Each binder consists of two body plates whichattach at one end to a short hook and at the other end to ahandle that holds a pivoting long hook.  Use the follow-ing instructions to use a 15-foot tie-down strap with thequick-fit strap fastener, load binder, and a 15-foot cottonwebbing tie-down strap (Figure 8-20).(1)  Pass the free end of the tie-down strap up, over,around, or through the tie-down provision, then back to-ward the tie-down strap D-ring.(2)  Attach a quick-fit strap fastener, with the pro-truding edge of the friction bar facing up, to the free endof the tie-down strap.8-122,5705,1008,30012,20016,70021,8003,8507,70012,50018,30025,00032,7005,10010,30016,70024,40033,40043,600Figure 8-19.

INTRODUCTIONTransferring cargo from or to a ship by helicopter usinga  cargo  sling  is  called  vertical  replenishment(VERTREP).  VERTREP is often more practical thanreceiving the helicopter on deck, so it is used in mostNavy and Coast Guard sling load operations.  VERTREPincreases the capability of the alongside replenishmentoperation.  This chapter provides general instructionsand specific rigging procedures for VERTREP opera-tions.  For more detailed information on VERTREP, re-fer to NWP 14, NWP 42, or COMDTINST M3710.2.Should conflicts arise between the procedures found inthis  chapter  and  those  found  in  NWPs  andCOMDTINSTS, the NWPs and COMDTINSTs will gov-ern.  The decision to land the aircraft or use VERTREPwill depend on various factors: size, shape, and weightof the cargo; stability of the flight deck; and urgency ofthe mission.9-2.  VERTICAL REPLENISHMENT AIRCRAFTThe  Navy  and  Coast  Guard  use  several  aircraft  forVERTREP operations.  The H-46 is the most widely usedNavy VERTREP helicopter; its tandem rotor configura-tion allows maneuverability without the wind restric-tions of tail rotor helicopters.  Therefore, the ships mayvary course and speed while undergoing VERTREP.  TheH-2, H-3, and H-60 helicopters have VERTREP capa-bilities but their use is limited due to mission design andrequirements.  The H-53 is used by the Marine Corpsfor vertical lifts and by the Navy for vertical onboarddelivery (VOD) operations.  The UH-1 has a weight-limited VERTREP capability.  All Coast Guard heli-copters have VERTREP capability.  Refer to NWP 42,COMDTINST M3710.2, and Chapter 2 of this manualfor each helicopter’s general capabilities.9-3.    COAST  GUARD  DANGEROUS  CARGOVERTREPWhen  moving  dangerous  cargo,  the  provisions  ofAFJMAN 24-204 must be followed.  Although AFJMAN24-204 specifically prescribes rules for carrying danger-ous materials internally aboard military aircraft, the CoastGuard applies the rules to sling load cargo as well.  Airmovement of hazardous materials (internal and exter-nal) will be in accordance with AFJMAN 24-204.  How-ever, the preferred method to move such cargo is by slingloading.  Waivers to the provisions of AFJMAN 24-204and authorization to move hazardous materials not listedin AFJMAN 24-204 may be requested from Comman-dant (G-OAV) via the chain of command.NOTE: When operating in remote areas, when themission is adversely affected, or when the health andwelfare of personnel is jeopardized by a delay in ob-taining a waiver, the Commanding Officers of the aircapable  cutters  may  authorize  the  movement  of"single dagger" items (as annotated in Table 4-1,AFJMAN 24-204) aboard their deployed aircraft.9-4.  FACTORS AFFECTING VERTREPa.  Wind.  For VERTREP, the helicopter must hoverover the ship.  The difference between engine powerrequired to hover without a load and maximum avail-able engine power is the excess power which can be usedto carry cargo.  A relative wind of 15 to 30 knots isconsidered ideal.  The helicopter should take off, makeapproaches, and hover into the relative wind.b.  Temperature and Atmospheric Pressure.   Anyincrease in temperature or decrease in atmospheric pres-sure will decrease maximum lift capability.  This loss inlift is a result of reduced engine performance and re-duced  aerodynamic  performance  of  the  rotor  blades.Thus, a cold, dry day with high barometric pressure and9-1FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2Aa strong, steady relative wind is ideal for VERTREP.c.  Helicopter Fuel Loading.  A full load of fuel addssubstantial  weight  to  the  helicopter  and  reduces  theamount of cargo that can be lifted.  As the fuel is used,more cargo can be lifted.  The amount of cargo to betransferred, distance to be flown, and wind and weatherconditions are some of the factors to be considered indetermining the fuel load.9-5.  VERTICAL REPLENISHMENT EQUIPMENTCertain  cargo-handling,  load-carrying,  and  auxiliaryequipment is needed for VERTREP.  Some items havebeen used for alongside replenishment or cargo handlingfor a number of years.  A few have been designed spe-cifically for VERTREP.  The VERTREP equipment isgenerally different from other equipment used to slingload cargo and equipment (Chapters 6, 7, and 8).a.  Pallets.  Four-way pallets are platforms 40 inchesby 48 inches by approximately 4 inches high, constructedof welded steel (Figure 9-1) or hardwood, usually oak.They are designed to be lifted by a forklift truck fromeither side.  Cargo should be banded or strapped to pal-lets to provide a stable and secure load.Figure 9-2.  Hoisting Sling Hooked to Cargotainerc.  Cargo Nets.  Most VERTREP cargo is moved innylon cargo nets made of 1 1/2-inch wide nylon web-bing (Figure 9-3).  Overall net size is 12 feet by 12 feetor 14 feet by 14 feet.  Oval metal rings on each of thefour corners are used to lift the net.  Rough handling,such as dragging, causes extensive damage to nylonwebbing and should be avoided.Figure 9-1.  Four-way Pallet (Nestable TubularSteel)9-2Figure 9-3.  Nylon Cargo Net, Mkl06 Mod 0Cargo Pallet Net, and BecketFM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2Ad.  Pallet Sling.   The pallet sling is a two-loop wirerope sling used to lift loaded pallets without using a cargonet (Figure 9-4).  Lifting eyes provide the attachmentpoints for the hoisting sling used to carry the load byhelicopter.  There are four models of this sling; eachmodel accommodates a different size load and a color-coded tube on the cable between the two lifting eyesindicates the sling size (see Table 9-1).Figure 9-4.  Pallet Slinge.  Hoisting Sling Mk105.  This sling, called the mul-tileg-pole pendant or reach pendant, is approved for alltypes of VERTREP loads up to 6,000 pounds (Figure 9-5).  The Mk105 consists of two parts: the pendant sec-tion and the leg assemblies.(1)    The  pendant,  made  of  1  1/8-inch  diameter,double-braided nylon rope, is approximately 12 feet long.The silicone-impregnated eye at the lower end of thependant aids in removing the attached legs from the pen-dant.  The upper eye is encased in flexible tubing andallows the pendant to slip off or on the cargo hook whenreleased or attached.  A 6-foot plastic reach tube en-cases the upper portion of the pendant and provides therigidity needed to place the upper eye over the cargohook.(2)  The legs are made of color-coded, 15/16-inchdiameter, double-braided nylon rope with an open eyesplice at one end and a positive-closing, self-lockingcargo hook at the other end.  The regular leg (orange) is85 inches long and the long leg (green) is 116 incheslong.    As  many  as  six  legs  may  be  attached  to  thependant’s lower eye by means of choker hitches (Figure9-5 inset).  The number of legs used is determined bythe number of attachment points on the load.  Four regu-lar legs are provided with each pendant at the time ofissue.

This actionstretches the pendant and the result is a smooth loadpickup with minimum shock and stress to the aircraftand load.f.  Hoisting Sling Mkl28 Mod 0.   This sling consistsof two parts: the pendant and the legs (two per unit).The pendant has a spliced eye at each end and a stiffen-ing tube to allow for extended hookup (Figure 9-6).  Oneeye attaches to the cargo hook.  The other eye is forattachment of the leg assembly.  The legs, color-codedgreen, have a spliced eye at one end and a hook at theother end.  The legs are fastened to the eye of the pen-dant with a choker hitch.  The entire assembly with oneor more legs is rated at 4,000 pounds.CAUTIONComponents of different load capacity or typesling  assemblies  are  not  interchangeable.Mixing of components of different capacityor type slings can result in unpredictable lift-ing characteristics or failure of the sling as-sembly.9-6.  LOAD PREPARATIONThe primary concern in load preparation is to provide aload that will ride safely in flight and arrive at the desti-nation undamaged.  VERTREP loads are subject to ex-tremely high winds from rotor wash during hover andflight.  Detailed procedures in NAVSEA S9751-AA-MMA-010,  used  for  preparing  ordnance  loads  forVERTREP, can also be used to prepare other loads ofsimilar configuration.a.  Pallet Assembly.  In assembling loads to be movedon pallets, the following rules apply:(1)  Stack and strap small boxes and crates to thepallets to provide a stable and secure load.  Looselypacked loads on pallets are a safety hazard and shouldnot be transported by helicopter.(2)  Interlace load layers whenever possible.(3)  Band pallet loads tightly and adequately.  Addnylon strapping to prevent the load from shifting whenthe pallet is moved by forklift truck or while it is inflight.Figure 9-5.  Mk 105 Hoisting Sling (Multi-leg Pole)9-4FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2APENDANTASSEMBLYPROTECTORLEGASSEMBLYFigure 9-6.  Hoisting Sling Mk 128 Mod O(4)  Check for load integrity of any cargo that waspalletized at the Naval ammunition depot or supply cen-ter.  Reband as necessary.b.  Cargotainer Loading.   When preparing cargot-ainer loads, remember the following:(1)  Raise and lock the  sides  of the cargotainer.(2)  Avoid lightweight (less than 100 pounds) loadsbecause of their instability during flight.  It is possiblethat a lightweight load may be blown against the bottomof the helicopter.c.  Cargo Net Loading (Loose Cargo).   Use nets fortransferring general cargo.  Observe the following ruleswhen loading cargo nets:(1)  Avoid lightweight (less than 100 pounds) loadsbecause of their instability during flight.(2)  Do not load small cartons on the bottom of thenet where they could be forced out through the openingsin the net.(3)  Cover or secure lightweight or small items to-gether to keep them from blowing out of the net.  Oncethey are packed together, place them on top of the largerloads.NOTE:  One method of safeguarding small itemsagainst loss in flight is to secure the corners of the nettogether by taking opposing corner rings and weav-ing them through at least two web straps in the web-bing below the opposite rings.  Figure 9-7 illustratesthe steps to be used.  Fasten the sling leg through allfour corner rings.  When the helicopter lifts the net,the weight of the load will cinch the net and preventthe items from being lost through the net.d.  Palletized Cargo.  The following procedure is thepreferred method for loading palletized cargo in a net:(1)  Band or strap cargo securely to the pallet.(2)  Lay the cargo net out on the deck and place theloaded pallet in the center.(3)  Draw the net up around the load and lay the cor-ners of the net loosely on top of the load.(4)  Secure the net (corners) rings with a becket.9-5FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2A9-6FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2ACAUTIONPaired loads should be approximately thesame configuration to reduce the possibilityof tipping over on pickup or delivery.9-8.  ATTACHING SLINGS TO LOADSa.  Adjustable Pallet Slings.  Palletized ordnance maybe transferred without cargo nets using the adjustablepallet sling (Figure 9-8).  In order to attach the sling tothe load, follow these steps:(1)  Select the proper (color-coded) sling length ac-cording to the height of the load. (Refer to Table 9-1.)(2)  Pass each loop of the sling under the overhangmade by the upper boards on the sides of the pallet.(3)  Pull the ends of the sling cable containing theswage stops through the sling tensioners (Figure 9-9)until the bridle is tight across the top of the load andslack is out of the cable.(4)  Adjust the sling so that the lifting thimbles arecentered and at an equal height from the pallet.(5)  Place each tensioner over the nearest swage stop,lower the latch to the stirrup, and lock the tensioner.CAUTIONThe last swage stop in each sling leg is a safetybead and will not be used.b.  Safety Hook Operation.   The safety hook is theonly moving part of the hoisting sling assembly legs(Figure 9-10).  You must be able to operate the safetyFigure 9-8.  Adjustable Pallet Sling Mk85, 86, 87, and 1009-7FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2AFigure 9-9.

(4)  For loads with four attachment points, such as acargotainer, use the Mk105 hoisting sling with four legs.When pairing loads (from two to six lifting points), usethe Mk105 hoisting sling with a leg for each lifting point(Figure 9-12).CAUTIONRemove any legs on the Mk105 that are notattached to a lifting point on the load.  d.  Special Procedures for Nonstandard Loads.   Re-fer  to  NAVSEA  S9750-AA-MMA-010  for  attachingadapters to containers and rigging missile dollies forVERTREP.  Large, bulky, or odd-shaped loads that can-not be carried on a pallet or in nets will be provided withslings or lifting eyes for attaching pendant/sling.  Thepilot will always be consulted about the feasibility ofmoving nonstandard loads.CAUTIONWhen rigging a special load, carefully inspectthe load attachment points to ensure that theyare the correct/designated points.  What ap-pears to be a lifting eye or lifting point maybe a provision for other purposes (for ex-ample, a tie-down point) and may not be in-tended for helicopter external lifting.9-9.  CARGO STAGINGPrior to actual flight operations, the maximum possibleamount of cargo is staged on the flight deck.  Primaryconsiderations in preparing and executing the flight deckcargo staging plan follow:•All  cargo  must  be  staged  within  the  hover  areabounded by marked lines and/or hover limit line(s) andbe accessible for pickup by the helicopter.•When possible, allow sufficient room between loadsfor the hookup man to move about freely and have anemergency escape route.9-9Figure 9-11.  Operation of Safety Hook (Continued)c.  Hoisting Slings.(1)  For loads with a single lifting point, such as acargo net, use an Mk105 hoisting sling with one singlesling leg.  Connect the sling leg safety hook to the load’sapex fitting or lifting provisions.CAUTIONThe single leg on the Mk105 hoisting slingreduces the safe working load of the slingfrom 6,000 pounds to 3,000 pounds.     (2)  For loads with two attachment points, such as apallet rigged with a pallet sling, attach two legs to thelower eye of the Mk105 hoisting sling by means of achoker hitch; then connect the safety hooks on the legsto the lifting thimbles on the pallet sling—one leg toone thimble.  An alternate hoisting sling for a load withtwo attachment points is the Mkl28 Mod 0. Attach it inthe same manner as the Mk105 sling.  After the hooksare attached, secure the legs with the hook-and-pile fas-tener strap to ensure that the strap legs do not work looseunder the load and tip over during pickup.(3)  When using the Mk105 hoisting sling to lift loadswith two attachment points, ensure that both lifting legsFM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2A9-10FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2Aand pickup zone, except for the hookup men.  Hookupmen take their position alongside the LSO on a CoastGuard cutter or beside the load in a Navy operation tohold the pendant up to signal the location of the load tothe pilot.  The helicopter crew chief, viewing the pickupzone through the open cargo hook access hatch or air-craft door, advises the pilot via the helicopter’s internalcommunications  system  as  to  the  final  maneuveringneeded to place the helicopter exactly over the load.  TheCoast Guard crewman signals the hookup team to ap-proach the load and prepare for hookup.  As the helicop-ter hovers over the load, the hookup man grounds thehelicopter hook.  He then raises the pendant, slips theeye over the helicopter’s hook, and returns to his posi-tion beside the LSO/LSE.b.  When conditions prevent the hookup man from plac-ing the pendant/sling on the aircraft cargo hook, thehookup man passes the pendant/sling to the crew chiefand then clears the area, moving toward the LSE.  Thecrew chief then places the pendant over the helicopterhook and ensures that the load is secure and ready forlifting.WARNINGHookup personnel must never stand on theload or between the load being picked up andanother load unless operational requirementsdictate.c.  The aircrew member aboard the helicopter directsload  placement  while  the  helicopter  hovers  over  thepickup or drop area.  The LSO/LSE continues givinghand-and-arm signals as a backup to internal communi-cation and to indicate any emergencies to the pilot oraircrew.  Radio transmissions to the pilot hovering overthe VERTREP zone are distracting and should be of anurgent nature only.WARNINGPersonnel must not enter the flight deck land-ing zone or attempt to steady the load whilethe load is suspended above the deck.d.  After the sling load is hooked up and the hookupteam is clear, the crew member aboard the helicopterthen gives pickup and lift-off directions to the pilot inorder to clear the load from the pickup area.9-12.  LOAD DELIVERYDuring the final approach to the ship, the pilot is guidedby the LSO/LSE and the helicopter crew member.  Onceover the VERTREP area, the pilot follows the LSO/LSEand his crew member’s directions to position the loadover the cargo landing point.  He relies on the crewmember’s directions for precision spotting and lower-ing the load.  As soon as the load is on deck, the crewmember informs the pilot.  When the pendant slackens,the LSO/LSE signals the pilot.  The pilot or crew mem-ber releases the cargo hook.  The crew member informsthe pilot when the load is released.CAUTIONDo not release the load before there is slackin the sling legs.  Premature release can causethe pole pendant to damage the load or causepersonnel injury.WARNINGPersonnel clearing stores must remove allbanding strips, paper, and other debris fromthe VERTREP area before the next helicop-ter approaches to prevent injury to person-nel and damage to helicopter engines and ro-tor blades.9-13.  CLEARING THE VERTREP AREAa.  Unloading the Cargo.   Once the load is releasedand the helicopter has departed, cargo handlers will pre-pare the load for distribution to the users or relocate itclear of the landing area.(1)  Nets, beckets, and cargo wraparound straps shallnever be cut.  Assigned men open the net and cut anybanding or strapping on the load.  Cargo handlers whohave been standing by clear of the VERTREP area, movein,  pick  up  a  portion  of  the  cargo,  and  leave  theVERTREP area.  The last ones remove the net and loosedebris from the VERTREP area, and place them in astaging area.  The nets are folded for later return to thehelicopter.9-11FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2A(2)  Do not wave off a loaded helicopter with a slingload solely because the VERTREP area is not completelyclear of the previous load.  If space is available for addi-tional cargo, the load being worked should be tempo-rarily secured by pulling the net up over the load andthreading the hoisting sling leg through the net ends.All personnel must then clear the area while the nextload is being deposited.  Speed is second only to safetyin clearing the VERTREP area.b.    Retrograde  Operations.    As  pallets,  nets,cargotainers, and hoisting slings accumulate on the flightdeck, cargo handlers should assemble and prepare theVERTREP equipment for return.  Retrograde operationsmust start at the request of the delivery ship.(1)  Pallets.  Prepare pallets for return in the follow-ing manner:(a)  Stack pallets to assemble a load between 16and 68 inches high.  Four to 14 wooden pallets or six ormore metal pallets may be stacked to make up the load.(b)  Rig the pallets with the appropriate size palletsling.  Secure pallets to prevent loss during flight.(c)  Attach a hoisting sling (two attachment points)to the pallets.CAUTIONWhen preparing tubular steel pallets for re-turn, use a minimum of six pallets per stackto ensure flight stability.NOTE: Three loads of pallets may be returned in thesame lift if there is sufficient clearance to lift the loadclear of the flight deck.  In this case, attach the hoist-ing sling (six sling legs) after the loads are spotted onthe flight deck (Figure 9-12).(2)  Nets and Pallets.   If you are moving nets andpallets together, follow these procedures:(a)  Stack four or more wooden pallets or six ormore metal pallets in the center of the net.(b)  Fold the unused nets to the same width and9-12length as the pallets and place them on top of the pal-lets.(c)  Pull the bottom net corners up around the en-tire load and secure the rings.(d)  Attach a hoisting sling (one attachment point).(3)  Cargotainers.  Return cargotainers by foldingand placing them inside one cargotainer.  Place extrastraps and slings inside the cargotainer.  Connect onesling (four attachment points) to the load.  An alternatemethod is to place folded cargotainers in a net.WARNINGDo not, under any circumstances, hook anempty net to the helicopter without at leastfour wooden or six metal pallets or equiva-lent weight in the net.  To do so could causedamage to the helicopter by allowing the netto be blown into the helicopter’s rotors.  If indoubt, consult the pilot.(4)  Slings and Pendants.  Slings and pendants mustbe returned to the delivering unit/platform so that theycan be used for future VERTREP missions.  Thread oneleg of a sling through the lifting eyes of the pendants/slings that will be moved.  A minimum of 10 pendants/slings with legs attached is recommended in order tomaintain stability in flight.  Attach a safety hook aroundthe sling legs to keep them together during flight.  Pro-ceed with hookup.9-14.  SAFETYSafety is the primary consideration in all VERTREP op-erations.  The following precautions must be taken:a.  All personnel except the LSO/LSE, static wand per-son, and hookup man (when required) must clear thelanding area during delivery, pickup, takeoff, and land-ing.  Do not attempt to steady the load.b.  Cargo handling personnel must wear life jackets,helmets with chin strap, goggles, safety shoes, and earprotection.  Loose articles of clothing will not be worn.Remove covers, rags, and other loose articles from pock-ets.FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2Ac.  All personnel in the vicinity of the helicopter mustremove their covers when the rotors are turning.(1)  Obstructions in the vicinity of the VERTREParea should be illuminated.d.  All personnel at the landing area must be trained toclear the area around the helicopter immediately on com-mand of the officer in charge.e.  Personnel working near the helicopter must observethe aircraft carefully for any sign of a malfunction suchas smoke, oil, or a hydraulic leak, and immediately re-port any such conditions to the pilot or VERTREP of-ficer.f.  The flight deck must be cleared of all objects whichcan be blown about by rotor wash or ingested into thehelicopter engines.9-15.  NIGHT VERTREPNight  VERTREP  operations  take  longer  than  dayVERTREP  operations  because  of  reduced  visibility.Night VERTREP is carried out in the same manner asday VERTREP, subject to the limitations set forth inthis chapter.  The final decision regarding whether aparticular ship can be vertically replenished at night isleft to the pilot.  Factors affecting night VERTREP areas follows:a.  Helicopter Limitations.   The helicopter must becapable of instrument flight.b.  Weather/Sea State.   Adverse weather conditionsfurther reduce night VERTREP capabilities.c.  Ship Lighting.  Ships certified for night helicopteroperations are properly lighted.  As a minimum, shipsshall use lights as  follows:(2)  Red flood lights should be focused on the flightdeck at a point forward of the cargo VERTREP area.9-16.  NIGHT VERTREP PROCEDURESEssentially  the  same  procedures  are  used  for  nightVERTREP as during the day.  However, night cargopickup and delivery require increased care and preci-sion.  A wider flight pattern is necessary under low vis-ibility conditions.  Delivery rates, therefore, are lowerthan during daylight hours.a.  Coordination.  The commanding officer is respon-sible for employing a course that will keep the ship’sstack gases away from the helicopter in the VERTREParea, as night vision may be affected.b.  Communications.  The following communicationsprocedures must be performed in night VERTREP:(1)  The LSO must use green or white/yellow tintedwands for helicopter direction signals.(2)  The LSO must use the landing signal light kit(battery powered).(3)  Information concerning identification such as,bearing, distance, and load weight must be transmittedby radio.  USN uses other methods during emergencycommunications (EMCOM) such as placards, notes, ormessengers relaying information to the pilot.9-13FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL

EXPEDIENT STATIC DISCHARGE WANDAPPENDIX DDischarging static electricity is an important step to theoverall safety of the hookup team.  You can assemble afield expedient static discharge wand using the follow-ing components:  •Cut a 20-inch and a 16-inch section from the genera-tor grounding rod.  The 20-inch section will be the staticdischarge  wand  and  the  16-inch  section  will  be  thegrounding rod.  •Grounding rod, NSN 5975-00-240-3859.  This 1/2-inch grounding rod or equivalent is used for the staticdischarge wand and grounding rod.  •Using the conductor splice, clamp one end of the cableto the 20-inch section of rod approximately 11 inchesfrom the end of the rod (Figure D-1).  •Conductor splice, NSN 5975-00-233-9022.  The con-ductor splice clamps the grounding cable to the wand.  •Grounding cable, NSN 4010-00-286-2681.  If you donot want to order this 1000 foot roll of cable, contact thenearest petroleum handling or ground power section toobtain a length of grounding cable.  •Electrical clip, NSN 5999-00-260-0447.  You will re-ceive electrical clips for five static discharge wands.  •Rubber hose, NSN 4720-00-277-8985.  Order enoughof this 5/8-inch inside diameter rubber hose to cut a 12-inch section for each static discharge wand.Use the following steps to assemble the field expedientstatic discharge wand:  •Cut a section of grounding cable approximately 20feet long.  Strip 1 inch of insulation off both ends of thecable.  •Slide the 12-inch piece of rubber hose over the cableand grounding rod so that the rod is approximately 1inch from the end of the rubber hose.  Fill the end of thehose with silicone sealant to provide insulation protec-tion from the bare end of the rod (Figure D-2).  If arubber hose is not available, wrap electrical tape or pres-sure-sensitive tape around the clamp and the lower por-tion of the rod so that the tape is approximately 1/2-inchthick.  •Bend the last two inches of the rod 90 degrees to forma hook to connect to the helicopter cargo hook (FigureD-3).  •Sharpen one end of the 16-inch ground rod into a pointto make it easier to drive into the ground.  •Attach an electrical clip to the other end of the 20-foot cable.  Connect the clip to the grounding rod (Fig-ure D-4).Figure D-1.  Cable Clamped to RodD-1FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2AFigure D-2.  Insulation Around RodFigure D-3.  Static Discharge Wand HookWARNINGKeep hands away from the bare metal por-tion of the static discharge wand when con-tacting the cargo hook to discharge the staticelectricity.  Severe electrical shock can resultfrom improper static discharge wand opera-tion.Inspect the wand for serviceability before and after eachtime you use the wand.  Pay particular attention to anycondition that may prevent good continuity, such as cor-rosion, broken cable, loose clamp, or broken insulation.Repair as necessary.Figure D-4.  Clamp Connected to Grounding Rod  •Use a multimeter to perform an electrical continuitycheck between the hook end of the static discharge wandand the electrical clip on the grounding rod.  Isolate andrepair or replace the affected part.  Lack of continuitycan be a safety hazard to the hookup team.D-2FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2AE-1FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2AE-2FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2Acargo hook.load)E-3FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2AAPPENDIX FZONE INSPECTION, PLANNING, PREPARATION, AND OPERATIONEVALUATION BRIEF FORMAT (NWP 55-9-ASH)(ZIPPO)(Use only appropriate lines, this is the entire format)Mission NumberUnit Supported/Call SignALO Call SignHC(A) Call SignTAC(A)/AFAC Call SignHelo Transport Cmdr Call SignAttack Helo Flight Coordinator/Leader Call SignF/W Call SignNumber and Type of HelosPick-Up CoordinatesLZ DescriptionDrop CoordinatesLZ Description//////F-1FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2A       Approach Retirement Routes      Total Troops/Heliteam Size       Internal Cargo Loads: Type/Weight      External Cargo Loads: Type/Weight///       Assault FM                                                                                          PRI                        /SEC       Assault UHF                                                                                        PRI                        /SEC       Ground Tactical/LZ Control Call Sign                                                 PRI                         /SEC///////////#                                       MINS      F/W Control FM/UHF      Weather Minimums/Alternate Plan      Pick-Up Time/Latest Acceptable      L-Hour/Latest Acceptable      Arty Prep Time/End of Mission      F/W Flights/TOS/Ordnance      F/W Cap/TOS/Ordnance     Rules-of-Engagement/Clearance to Fire      Intelligence      Refuel   Min BingoF-2FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2A#MINSMINS# WT                         LIFTS                   # WTLIFTS   Mission Undertake   Length of (estimated)MEDEVACPriority   PrecedenceResupplyInternalExternalF-3FM  10-450-3/MCRP 4-23E, VOL I/NWP 3-04.11/AFJMAN 11-223, VOL I/COMDTINST M13482.2AAPPENDIX GMC-140 HELMET, COMPONENT LISTING (USMC HST)  TAMCN C4992This appendix lists the components of the MC-140 helmet.
