This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive education and training document that identifies life-cycle education/training requirements, training support resources and minimum core task requirements for this specialty.  The CFETP will provide personnel a clear career path to success and instill rigor in all aspects of career field training. 2.  The CFETP consists of two parts; both of which are used by management to plan, manage, and control training within the career field. 2.1. Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty.  Section A explains how everyone will use the plan; Section B identifies career progression information, duties and responsibilities, training strategies, and career field path; Section C associates each level with specialty qualifications (knowledge, education, training, and other); Section D indicates resource constraints.  Some examples are funds, manpower, equipment, and facilities.  Note:  The Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory (AFECD) and AFI 36-2101 Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted) contain the specialty descriptions. 2.2.  Part II includes the following: Section A identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS) and includes duties, tasks, technical references to support training, Air Education and Training Command (AETC) conducted training, and correspondence course requirements.  Section B contains the course objective list and training standards supervisors will use to determine if Airmen satisfy training requirements.  Section C identifies available training support materials.  Section D identifies a training course index that is used to determine resources available to support training. Included here are both mandatory and optional courses.  Sections E and F identify MAJCOM unique training requirements. 2.3.  Attachment 3 to the electronic version of the CFETP is a career path chart.  This chart provides a visual depiction of the Loadmaster AFSC, Career Enlisted Flyers Incentive Pay gates and years of aviation service, and key information to education, training and qualification.  It also contains promotion information specific to the Loadmaster AFSC, such as average time in grade, time in service, as well as Air Force averages.  This chart provides a timeline for achieving additional qualifications such as instructor, evaluator, Flying Training Unit (FTU) assignment, and leadership opportunities within the Squadron, Group, Wing and MAJCOM and HQ/USAF. 3.  This CFETP is designed to ensure individuals in AFSC 1A2XX receive comprehensive and effective training at the appropriate phases of their career.

This CFETP provides information necessary for the Air Force Career Field Manager (AFCFM), MAJCOM functional managers (MFMs), commanders, training managers, supervisors, and trainers to plan, develop, manage, and conduct an effective and efficient career field training program.  The plan outlines the training that individuals must receive in order to develop and progress throughout their career.  For the purpose of this plan, training is divided into four areas:  initial skills, upgrade training (UGT), qualification training (QT), and continuation training (CT).  Initial skills training is the Air Force Specialty specific training an individual receives upon entry into the Air Force or upon retraining into this specialty for award of the 3-skill level.  Upgrade training identifies the mandatory courses, task qualification requirements, and correspondence course completion required for award of the 3-, 5-, 7-, and 9- skill levels.  Qualification training is actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an airman in a specific duty position.  This training program occurs both during and after the upgrade training process.  It is designed to provide the performance skills/knowledge training required for the job.  Continuation training is additional training either in-residence or exportable advanced training courses, or on-the-job training, provided to personnel to increase their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required.  The CFETP has several purposes, some are: 1.1.  Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field training program.   1.2.  Identifies task and knowledge training requirements and recommends education and training for each skill level and phase of an individual’s career in this AFS. 1.3.  Lists training courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of training, and the training medium. 1.4.  Identifies major resource constraints that impact full implementation of the desired career field training program. 2.  Uses.   The CFETP will be used by MFMs and supervisors at all levels to ensure comprehensive and cohesive training programs are available and/or instituted for each individual in the specialty. 2.1.  AETC training personnel will develop and revise formal resident, non-resident, field and exportable training based on requirements established by the user and documented in Part II of the CFETP.  They will also work with the AFCFM to develop acquisition strategies for obtaining resources needed to provide the identified training. 2.2.  MFMs will ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial and upgrade skills requirements.  OJT, resident training, contract training, or exportable courses can satisfy identified requirements.  MAJCOM-developed training to support this AFSC must be identified for inclusion in this plan and must not duplicate available training resources. 2.3.  Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan.  The list of courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training. 2.4.  Personnel in AFSCs 1AXXX or 1U0X1 are exempt from maintaining OJT Training Folders (AF Form 623). All training is certified via AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification, by trained flight examiners.  Certification on the Form 8 eliminates the requirement to document STS items in this CFETP.  EXCEPTION: Some 1A2XX members assigned to Aerial Delivery Flights may require OJT folders to track events specific to that particular job. 3.  Coordination and Approval.  The AFCFM is the approval authority.  MAJCOM functional managers and AETC training managers will identify and coordinate on the career field training requirements.  The AFCFM will initiate an annual review of this document and coordinate with AETC and MFMs to ensure currency and accuracy. Using the list of courses in Part II, they will eliminate duplicate training. Send applicable inputs/changes to this CFETP through MAJCOM functional managers to HQ USAF/A3OIM, 1480 Air Force Pentagon, Washington D.C. 20330-1480 or the following organizational email address:  usaf.pentagon.af-a3.mbx.a3oim-workflow@mail.mil    8 CFETP 1A2X1 19 January 2016 Section B - Career Progression and Information 4.

The locations, course lengths, and titles are subject to change.  Changes will be updated in the Education Training Course Announcement by the course owner. 8.1.1. The course flow has been developed and agreed upon by the MAJCOM functional managers to minimize days students are awaiting training and to ensure survival training is typically completed prior to AFSC award--minimizing the impact of not having the prerequisites completed before entering weapons system training. 8.1.2. Personnel graduating from the Lackland AFB course are awarded AFSC 1A231 and are authorized to wear the Basic Aircrew Member Badge. Wear and permanent awarding requirements of the Basic Aircrew Member Badge will be IAW AFI 11-402, Aviation and Parachutist Service Aeronautical Ratings and Badges and MAJCOM supplements.  Failure to complete initial qualification training (IQT) is justification for supervisors to recommend revocation of wear of the Aircrew Member Badge. 15 CFETP 1A2X1 19 January 2016   Figure 2  1A2X1 Training Path 2 of 2   16 Table 6  1A2X1 Enlisted Education and Training Path CFETP 1A2X1 19 January 2016 Enlisted Education and Training Path Education and Training Requirements Rank  Earliest Sew-on Basic Military Training School (BMTS) Apprentice Technical School (3-Skill Level)  Amn A1C  6 months 10 months GRADE  REQUIREMENTS Air Force Average   1A2X1 Average   High Year of Tenure (HYT)    SSgt TSgt 3 years 3 years 8 years  28 4.50  years 4.51  years 3  years SrA months 15  years Amn A1C SrA Upgrade To Journeyman  (5-Skill Level) - Completion of Initial/Mission Qualification Training Airman Leadership School (ALS) - At least 3 years TIS but no more than 6 years TIS - Resident graduation is a prerequisite for SSgt   sew-on (RegAF Only)  Upgrade To Craftsman  (7-Skill Level) - Minimum rank of SSgt - 12 months OJT - 6 months OJT for retrainees Basic EPME Phase 2 Distance Learning - At least 7 years to 8 years TIS - Required to reenlist and compete for promotion EPME intermediate Learning Experience (ILE) - Minimum 8 years TIS no more than 12 years - Complete/Pass EPME DL Phase 2 - Must be SSgt, TSgt, or TSgt select to attend Basic EPME Phase 3 Distance Learning (DL) - At least 12 years to 13 years TIS - Required to reenlist and compete for promotion EPME Advanced Learning Experience (ALE) - Minimum 13 years TIS, no more than 18 years - Complete/Pass EPME DL Phase 2 & 3 - Must be a MSgt, SMSgt, SMSgt select to attend Upgrade to Superintendent (9-Skill level) - Minimum rank of SMSgt Chief Leadership Course FDL - No TIS requirements - Required for re-enlistment and development opportunities - Must be a CMSgt or CMSgt select to attend Chief Enlisted Manager (CEM) - Minimum rank of CMSgt - Completed EPME ALE   (RegAF Only) Data current as of 1 August 2015 Reference:  AFI 36-2301 AFGM2014-01 Developmental Education; AFI 36-2201 Air Force Training Program; and https://mypers.af.mil 10.53 years 15.16 years 30  years 11  years 14  years 26  years 24  years 15.16 years 19.12 years 21.84 years 5  years 8  years 23.43 years    MSgt SMSgt 9.79 years 19 years 20 years CMSgt  17 CFETP 1A2X1 19 January 2016 Section C - Skill Level Training Requirements 9.
