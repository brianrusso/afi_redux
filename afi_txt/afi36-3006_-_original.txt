General  Plan  Information.  Military  pay  stops  when  a  member  dies.    The  SBP  is  a Government  program  which  makes  it  possible  for  retiring  members  to  ensure  that  after  their death,  their  eligible  survivors  receive  a  portion  of  their  military  retired  pay  in  the  form  of  a monthly annuity.  The Plan was structured so that a surviving spouse cannot outlive the annuity and  it  has  Cost-of-Living  Adjustments  (COLAs)  incorporated  so  the  annuity  increases  with inflation. 1.1.  An active duty member who has eligible dependents is automatically covered by SBP at the maximum level at no cost to the member while he/she remains on active duty (reference paragraph 2.1). 1.2.  Prior  to  retiring,  each  member  must  decide  whether  to  continue  SBP  coverage  into retirement.  The retired pay of those members who elect to participate is reduced by monthly premiums.  The SBP is a unique Plan:  Government-subsidized premiums are deducted from a  participating  member’s  retired  pay  before  taxes.    SBP  is  the  sole  means  for  a  member  to AFI36-3006  7 OCTOBER 2009 5 continue  a  portion  of  their  military  retired  pay  to  their  eligible  survivors.    If  a  member chooses  (with  the  concurrence  of  their  spouse)  not  to  participate  in  the  SBP,  an  annuity cannot be paid. 1.3.  The Plan may provide an annuity to certain surviving spouses of members who retired and died before the implementation of the SBP, or in the case of a Reserve member, before the implementation of the Reserve Component SBP (RCSBP) (reference paragraph 3.9). 1.4.  Instruments  such  as  a  Power  of  Attorney  (POA)  may  not  be  used  to  make  an  SBP election on behalf of a member, nor may a POA be used to provide a spouse’s concurrence. 2.  Provisions Applicable to Active Duty Members. 2.1.  Active Duty Death Provision.  All members with eligible dependents are automatically covered by the SBP at no cost while they remain on active duty.  The member’s death must be classified in line of duty (LOD) in order for an annuity to be payable if the member is not yet  retirement  eligible  (had  not  accrued  20  years  of  active  duty)  on  the  date  of  death.    The annuity  payable  is  55  percent  of  the  retired  pay  the  member  would  have  been  entitled  to receive if retired with a total disability rating on the date of death.  (Exception:  Reference section E if the spouse or former spouse is age 62 or turns age 62 prior to 1 April 2008.)  An annuity  may  also  be  payable  when  the  member’s  death  is  classified  not  in  LOD,  if  the member was eligible for retirement (had accrued at least 20 years of active duty) on the date of death.  In this case, the annuity payable is 55 percent of the retired pay the member would have been entitled to receive if retired for years of service on the date of death.  (Exception:  Reference  section  E  if  the  spouse  or  former  spouse  is  age  62  or  turns  age  62  prior  to 1 April 2008.) 2.1.1.  Active Duty Death Coverage Types. 2.1.1.1.  Spouse Only  -  This coverage is automatic when an active duty member dies and  there  is  an  eligible  spouse  but  no  eligible  children  (unless    former  spouse  SBP was    court  ordered).    A  spouse’s  SBP  annuity  is  reduced  by  the  amount  of Dependency  and  Indemnity  Compensation  (DIC)  authorized  by  the  Department  of Veterans Affairs (VA) as a result of the member’s service connected death (reference paragraph  16.2)  payable  on  behalf  of  the  spouse.    If  DIC  is  not  awarded  (death  not service-connected as determined by the VA), the full SBP annuity may be paid. 2.1.1.2.  Child Only  -  This coverage is automatic when an active duty member dies and there is an eligible child(ren) but no eligible spouse (unless  former spouse SBP was    court  ordered).    Children  receive  the  annuity  in  equal  shares  while  eligible (reference paragraph 6.2.1 for definition of an eligible child).  The annuity payable to a child(ren) is not reduced by their entitlement to DIC. 2.1.1.3.  Spouse and Child  -  This coverage is automatic when an active duty member dies and there is an eligible spouse and an eligible child(ren) (unless  former spouse SBP  was    court  ordered).    The  spouse  is  the  primary  beneficiary.    Eligible  children are  contingent  beneficiaries  and  only  receive  the  annuity  if  the  spouse  dies  or remarries prior to age 55.  Children receive the annuity in equal shares while eligible. 2.1.1.4.  Child Only - Spouse Excluded  -  This coverage is not automatic.  Under the provisions of Public Law (PL) 108-136, 24 November 2003, for deaths in the line of 6 AFI36-3006  7 OCTOBER 2009 duty occurring on or after the effective date of the law, the Secretary of the Air Force, after consulting with the member’s surviving  spouse, may determine that an eligible child(ren)  receive the  annuity as the primary beneficiary instead of the spouse.  HQ AFPC/DPPRT  processes  these  active  duty  cases.    Children  receive  the  annuity  in equal  shares  while  eligible.    The  annuity  terminates  when  the  last  child  loses eligibility  and  CANNOT  be  switched  to  the  spouse.    Subsequently,  PL  109-364,  17 October 2006, retroactively expanded the SAF’s authority pay the child(ren) instead of the spouse in cases of active duty deaths in the line of duty that occurred on or after 8 October 2001. Interest the provisions –  Under 2.1.1.5.  Insurable 108-136, 24 November 2003, the Air Force can make this election on the deceased active duty member’s  behalf  for  a  survivor  who  was  the  member’s  dependent  for  ID  card purposes  at  the  time  of  the  member’s  death,  unless    there  is  an    eligible  spouse  or dependent child(ren). of  PL 2.1.1.6.  Former  Spouse  –    If  the  member  was  required  by  court  order  to  elect  SBP coverage at retirement for a former spouse, the active duty death SBP annuity may be payable  to  the  former  spouse  instead.    Court  ordered  former  spouse  SBP  coverage precludes payment of an annuity to a current spouse, child(ren), or insurable interest beneficiary. 2.2.  The active duty death provision also applies to a retired member recalled to active duty, who dies while on that active duty. 2.3.  Active Duty SBP When Retirement Eligible Member Died Prior to 21 September 1972.  PL  96-402,  9 October 1980,  widened  the  active  duty  death  benefit  by  extending  it  to surviving  spouses  of  members  who  died  on  active  duty  before  SBP  was  initiated (21 September 1972),  who  had  served  on  active  duty  for  at  least  20  years,  and  who  were eligible to retire at the time of death.  Entitlement to the annuity began on 1 December 1980.  The annuity was the difference between the spouse’s DIC entitlement and 55 percent of the retired pay the member would have been entitled to if retired for years of service on the date of  death  (adjusted  by  COLAs  applied  to  retired  pay  from  the  date  of  the  member's  death through 30 November 1980). 3.  Provisions  Applicable  to  Retiring  Members.  Before  retiring,  each  member  must  decide (concurrence  of  spouse  may  be  required)  whether  to  continue  active  duty  SBP  coverage (maximum for all eligible dependents) into retirement and pay the associated monthly premiums.  SBP  premiums  are  deducted  from  participant’s  retired  pay  and  are  not  counted  as  taxable income. 3.1.  Automatic Coverage.  If a member fails to make a valid SBP election prior to retiring, the law requires maximum coverage be established for all eligible beneficiaries (e.g., spouse, children,  or  spouse  and  children)  effective  the  date  retired  pay  begins.    Appropriate premiums will be deducted from the member’s retired pay. 3.2.  Spouse Notification Letter.  If the retiring member is married, it is a legal requirement that  a  letter  be  sent  to  his/her  spouse  regardless  of  the  status  of  the  marriage  (i.e.,  pending divorce, separated, legal separation, etc.) (sample letter at  attachment 2).  The letter  and an AFI36-3006  7 OCTOBER 2009 7 SBP fact sheet (sample at attachment 3) are sent so the spouse can become familiar with the SBP prior to the one-on-one pre-retirement SBP briefing. 3.3.  One-On-One  Pre-Retirement  SBP  Briefing.    Title  10,  United  States  Code,  section 1455(b) requires that the Service  fully inform each retiring  member and their spouse about the options and effects of the SBP so they understand the Plan in order  to make an informed decision.  These briefings are to be given by Air Force SBP counselors, who are trained on all aspects of the Plan.  Every retiring member, including unmarried members and members without eligible dependents, are required to receive this briefing.  This briefing is in addition to any mass briefing, and must be a private briefing (no more than one retiree and spouse at a time).  All items on the SBP RIP are to be briefed including future options available in the event of a change in marital or dependent status. 3.4.  Spouse Concurrence.  Effective 1 March 1986, PL 99-145 requires the spouse’s written concurrence  if  a  married  member  elects:    to  decline  coverage  at  retirement;  to  provide  a reduced annuity; or to provide an annuity to a child, but not the spouse.  If the spouse is not collocated with the member or cannot visit the Military Personnel Flight (MPF), concurrence can be accomplished by mail (sample transmittal letter at attachment 4).  If the spouse cannot visit  an  MPF,  the  spouse’s  signature  must  be  notarized.    The  spouse’s  concurrence  is  not required  if  the  retiring  member  elects  maximum  spouse  coverage  or  elects  former  spouse coverage. 3.4.1.  In  order  for  an  election  to  be  valid,  the  required  spouse  concurrence  must  be obtained after the member makes the election, but before the member’s retirement date.  If  the  concurrence  is  not  obtained  before  the  member's  retirement  date,  maximum  SBP coverage is automatically established for the following: 3.4.1.1.  For  the  spouse  if  the  member  declines  coverage  or  elects  to  provide  a reduced spouse annuity. 3.4.1.2.  For  the  spouse  and  eligible  child(ren)  if  the  member  elects  reduced  spouse and child coverage, elects child only coverage, or fails to make an election. 3.4.2.  If a retiring member is married and elects SBP coverage for a former spouse, or a former spouse and child(ren), neither spouse nor former spouse concurrence is required; however,  both  the  member's  current  spouse  and  former  spouse  must  be  notified  of  the election.  Attachment 5 contains a sample of the letter which must be sent to the spouse.  Attachments 6 and 7 contain samples of the letter and fact sheet which must be sent to the former spouse. 3.5.  Waiver of Spouse Concurrence.  The Secretary of the Air Force (SAF) may waive the requirement  to  obtain  the  spouse’s  written  concurrence  if  the  member  satisfactorily establishes  that  the  spouse’s  whereabouts  cannot  be  determined  or  that,  due  to  exceptional circumstances,  the  requirement  for  the  member  to  seek  the  spouse’s  concurrence  would  be otherwise inappropriate. 3.5.1.  Marital  discord,  pending  divorce  proceedings,  or  legal  separation  do  not  in themselves justify requesting a waiver of the spouse’s concurrence. 3.5.2.  To apply, the member completes an AF Form 2037, Request for Waiver of Spouse Concurrence in Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) Election, not later than 60 days prior to the 8 AFI36-3006  7 OCTOBER 2009 effective  date  of  retirement,  and  supplies  supporting  documentation  (e.g.,    copy  of missing  person’s  report;  notarized  statements  from  spouse’s  family  members  verifying whereabouts are unknown, etc.). 3.5.3.  The SBP counselor annotates Item 30a of the DD Form 2656, Data for Payment of Retired  Personnel,  with  the  notation  ―Request  for  waiver  of  spouse  concurrence submitted (date).‖  The SBP counselor sends the original AF Form 2037 with supporting documentation,  and  the  DD  Form  2656  to  Headquarters  (HQ),  Air  Force  Personnel Center (AFPC), Retiree Services Branch (HQ AFPC/DPPRT), 550 C Street West, Suite 3, Randolph Air Force Base TX  78150-4713. 3.5.4.  The  SBP  counselor  sends  a  copy  of  the    DD  Form  2656  to  the  Defense  Finance and  Accounting  Service  –  Cleveland  Center  (DFAS-CL)  at  DFAS-CL,  US  Military Retirement  Pay,  PO  Box  7130,  London  KY    40742-7130  for  use  in  establishing  the member’s retired pay account. 3.5.5.  A  waiver  request  not  properly  completed  will  be  returned  without  action.    If  the SAF  does  not  approve  the  waiver  request  before  the  member’s  retirement,  maximum coverage will be established as in paragraph 3.1, above.  If the SAF approves the waiver request after the member’s retirement, any excess costs deducted before the approval will be  refunded  to  the  member.    If  the  SAF  approves  the  waiver  request  and  it  is  later discovered  the  member’s  statement  concerning  the  spouse’s  whereabouts  at  the  time  of retirement  was  untrue,  maximum  spouse  coverage  will  be  established  with  cost  and interest collected retroactive to member’s date of retirement. 3.6.  Two Military Members. 3.6.1.  Two military members, married to one another, may elect spouse coverage for the other.    Two  military  members,  divorced  from  one  another,  may  elect  former  spouse coverage for each other.  Receipt of an SBP annuity will not affect the surviving spouse’s or former spouse’s receipt of retired pay on their own record. 3.6.2.  Two  military  parents  may  each  elect  child  SBP  coverage  for  eligible  child(ren), and  the  eligible  child(ren)  will  be  paid  two  annuities  in  the  event  both  military  parents die. 3.7.  Secretarial Election for Mentally Incompetent (MI) Member. 3.7.1.  The  SAF  makes  the  SBP  election  on  behalf  of  a  member  determined  to  be incompetent  by  medical  officers  of  the  Uniformed  Services  or  VA,  or  by  a  court  of competent  jurisdiction.  The election request  should  be made by the next-of-kin  (NOK) identified  on  the  disability  retirement  order.    As  the  person  most  knowledgeable  of  the service  member,  the  NOK’s  recommendation  about  the  SBP  coverage  they  believe  the member would select if able to  act on their own behalf is  an important  consideration in the SAF's decision.  Therefore, the NOK must be thoroughly briefed on the options and effects  of  the  SBP.    The  designated  NOK  makes  the  SBP  election  in  Section  IX  of  the DD  Form  2656.    Section  X  must  be  annotated  ―NOK  REQUESTS  THE  SAF CONSIDER THIS SBP ELECTION.‖  The designated NOK signs in Item 32a, and dates the form in Item 32b. AFI36-3006  7 OCTOBER 2009 9 3.7.2.  The SBP counselor should immediately fax the completed DD Form 2656 and any other  pertinent  documents  to  HQ  AFPC/DPPRT,  then  mail  the  originals    to  HQ AFPC/DPPRT, 550 C Street West, Suite 3, Randolph AFB, TX  78150-4713.  A copy of the  package  should  be  mailed  to  DFAS-CL  (DFAS-CL,  U.S.  Military  Retirement  Pay, PO Box 7130, London KY  40742-7130) at the same time. 3.7.3.  The  SBP  counselor  should  inform  the  NOK  that  if  the  member’s  condition improves  and  appropriate  medical  authorities  later  determine  the  member  to  be competent,  the SAF  election made on the member’s behalf may be changed or revoked within  180  days  after  the  competency  determination.    The  member’s  request  for  an election change and a copy of the competency determination should be sent to DFAS-CL.  Upon  approval,  the  request  becomes  effective  on  the  first  date  of  the  month  following receipt of the member’s request by DFAS-CL.  SBP costs paid before the effective date of revocation or change are not refunded. 3.8.  Overseas  Pre-Retirement  Processing.    Pre-retirement  processing  (including  the  SBP one-on-one briefing and completion of the DD Form 2656) for members assigned outside of the  Continental  United  States  (CONUS)  must  be  finalized  before  the  member’s  departure from the overseas station.  If the member later changes his/her mind, the SBP election can be changed at a CONUS base up to the day prior to the date of retirement. 3.9.  Air  National  Guard  (ANG)/USAF  Reserve  (USAFR).    A  member  of  the  ANG  or USAFR is required to make a Reserve Component SBP (RCSBP) election when notified by the Air Reserve Personnel Center (ARPC) of his/her eligibility for retired pay, except for not yet being age 60.  The RCSBP is administered by the ARPC.  Any member without a valid RCSBP election on file must make a SBP election upon applying for retired pay at age 60. 3.9.1.  If  a  member  of  the  ANG  or  USAFR  who  previously  elected  coverage  under  the RCSBP is recalled to active duty and becomes eligible to retire from active duty for years of  service,  that  member  is  required  to  make  an  election  under  the  SBP.    The  RCSBP election  remains  valid  until  the  member's  active  duty  retirement  becomes  effective.  However,  if  a  member  who  has  been  recalled  to  active  duty  dies  while  on  that  active duty,  an  annuity  may  be  payable  under  the  active  duty  death  provision  (reference paragraph 2.1) if more favorable to the survivors. 3.10.  Temporary Disability Retired List (TDRL)/Permanent Disability Retired List (PDRL).  A  member  being  placed  on  the  TDRL  or  PDRL  is  eligible  to  make  an  SBP  election regardless  of  length  of  active  service.    If  a  member  is  later  removed  from  the  TDRL  and placed on the PDRL, the election remains in effect and there is no refund of premiums paid during  the  period  the  member  was  on  the  TDRL.    In  this  case,  the  member  is  simply transferred from one retired list to the other.  The base amount may be affected if there is a change  in  the  method  or  disability  percentage  used  to  compute  retired  pay  (reference paragraph 5.4). 3.10.1.  If  a  member  is  removed  from  the  TDRL  and  returns  to  active  duty,  their  SBP election is  voided.   There is  no refund of premiums  paid  during the period the member was  on  the  TDRL.    A  member  returned  to  active  duty  (for  as  little  as  one  day),  who subsequently retires for years of service, must make a new SBP election. 10 AFI36-3006  7 OCTOBER 2009 3.10.2.  If a member is placed in a retired pay status on a date other than the first day of a month and participates in SBP, premiums begin the first day of the following month. 3.11.  Members who are recalled to  an active duty status  after  retirement are not  eligible to make a new SBP election (reference paragraph 4.3.2) when they revert to retired status. 4.  Provisions Applicable to Retired Members. 4.1.  Evidence  of  Participation.    Neither  certificates  nor  policies  are  issued  as  evidence  of SBP participation.  DFAS-CL sends the retiree a pay statement which reflects the deduction of  SBP  premiums  when  the  retired  pay  account  is  established,  annually  following  COLAs, and each time there is a change to the retired pay. 4.2.  Disenrollment Provision. 4.2.1.  Under  the  provisions  of  PL  105-85,  18  November  1997,  effective  17 May l998, members who elect SBP coverage at retirement have a one-year period during which they can  choose  to  voluntarily  discontinue  participation.    The  one-year  period  begins  on  the second  anniversary  of  the  date  of  commencement  of  retired  pay.    The  date  of commencement  of  retired  pay  is  defined  as  the  date  that  the  retiree  becomes  entitled  to receive retired pay.  A recall to active duty following retirement will not alter this date.  Neither DFAS-CL nor the Service will notify the member at the second anniversary date; it  is  the  member's  responsibility  to  submit  a  request  to  disenroll.    After  the  member’s third  anniversary,  the  election  becomes  irrevocable  as  long  as  there  is  an  eligible beneficiary. 4.2.2.  A participant eligible to disenroll must submit a written request to DFAS-CL using a  DD  Form  2656-2,  Survivor  Benefit  Plan  (SBP)  Termination  Request.    A  request  for information or a request  for termination that is not on a DD Form 2656-2 is not a valid request to disenroll and will not be honored. 4.2.3.  Participation  is  terminated  the  first  day  of  the  month  following  the  month  the properly  completed  form  (valid  and  timely)  is  received  by  DFAS-CL.    Example:    A member who retires 1 March 2005 submits a DD Form 2656-2, it is received by DFAS-CL on 29 April 2007, costs terminate 1 May 2007, and the pay adjustment will be in the payment received on 1 June 2007. 4.2.4.  SBP premiums paid before the termination effective date are not refunded. 4.2.5.  A covered spouse must concur in writing with the member’s decision to disenroll (reference  paragraph  4.2.7,  below).    This  requirement  may  not  be  waived  except  as described  below. 4.2.5.1.  If it is determined a spouse is unable to complete the concurrence section of the DD Form 2656-2 because of a verified medical condition (e.g. advanced stages of Alzheimer’s  disease,  etc.),  the  SAF  may  approve  the  member's  request  to  disenroll.  The member must submit the DD  Form 2656-2 to HQ AFPC/DPPRT, 550 C Street West,  Suite 3, Randolph  Air  Force  Base TX   78150-4713 with  documentation  from medical  authority or a court of competent  jurisdiction that defines and describes the severity  and  permanence  of  the  medical  condition.    The  termination  form  must  be submitted  during  the  above  one-year  period  in  order  to  be  considered  a  valid termination request. AFI36-3006  7 OCTOBER 2009 11 4.2.6.  Coverage  for  a  former  spouse  may    be  terminated  under  this  disenrollment provision only with proper documentation.  If former spouse coverage was court ordered, an amended court order releasing the member of any obligation to provide former spouse coverage is  required.  The former spouse’s concurrence is not required in this situation.  If  former  spouse  coverage  was  established  voluntarily  or  to  honor  a  written  agreement that was not incorporated in a court order, the former spouse’s concurrence is required. 4.2.7.  The DD Form 2656-2 is  valid only if the spouse or former spouse concurrence is witnessed  by  a  Service-designated  SBP  counselor  or  notary  public.    A  photo  bearing identification must be presented to the witness to verify the spouse’s or former spouse’s identity and signature on the DD Form 2656-2. 4.2.8.  A member has 30 days following submission to withdraw a request to disenroll. 4.2.9.  If a member disenrolls under this provision, all coverage is terminated.  No person (e.g., spouse, child, former spouse) will receive an annuity in conjunction with previous coverage,  and  the  member  may  not  participate  in  the  SBP  at  any  future  time  for  any category of beneficiary. 4.3.  Irrevocability of Election. 4.3.1.  A member may change his/her election up to the day before the date of retirement.  However, after retiring, a member may not arbitrarily change or discontinue participation in  the  SBP  except  under  the  disenrollment  provision  (reference  paragraph  4.2),  total disability condition (reference paragraph 26), or when authorized because the status of a beneficiary changes. 4.3.2.  SBP elections are not voided by recall to active duty.  If retired pay is suspended by  recall  to  active  duty  for  more  than  30  days,  SBP  premiums  are  suspended  the  day before  entry  on  active  duty  and  member  is  not  required  to  remit  premiums  for  SBP coverage  while  on  active  duty.    If  a  member  who  has  been  recalled  to  active  duty  dies while on that active duty, an annuity may be paid based upon the SBP election or under the active duty death provision (reference paragraph 2.1), whichever is more favorable to the survivors. 4.4.  Procedure  to  Change  SBP  Coverage  After  Retiring  when  the  Status  of  a  Beneficiary Changes. 4.4.1.  It  is  the  retired  member’s  responsibility  to  notify  DFAS-CL  (DFAS-CL,  U.S. Military  Retirement  Pay,  PO  Box  7130,  London  KY  40742-7130)  if  the  member’s marital status changes and when the status of a beneficiary changes.  Notification should be made immediately after the change occurs so that available options do not expire and appropriate  adjustments  may  be  made  to  the  member’s  retired  pay  account  in  a  timely manner. 4.4.2.  Notification  can  be  made  on  a  DD  Form  2656-6,  Survivor  Benefit  Plan  Election Change Certificate, or in the form of a signed and dated letter with specific information on  the  action  requested.    Appropriate  documentation  should  be  included  (reference Attachment  8).    Additional  documents  may  be  required  if  DFAS-CL  determines  it necessary to process a requested action. 12 AFI36-3006  7 OCTOBER 2009 4.4.3.  .  If requesting coverage be converted from spouse or spouse and child to former spouse or former spouse and child (reference 6.4.4 and 6.5), the retiree should submit a DD  Form  2656-1,  Survivor  Benefit  Plan  (SBP)  Election  Statement  For  Former  Spouse Coverage, and a copy of the divorce decree including property settlement (if applicable) to  DFAS-CL  within  one  year  following  divorce.    A  valid  election  for  former  spouse coverage becomes effective the date following the date the divorce was finalized. 4.4.4.  A DD Form 2656, Data For Payment of Retired Personnel, may NOT be used to update or change an election AFTER a member retires. Section B—Election Options 5.  Base  Amount.  The retiring member must elect the level of retired pay (base amount) to be covered  by  SBP.    Any  amount  less  than  the  maximum  (gross  retired  pay)  requires  spousal concurrence.    The  base  amount  is  used  to  calculate  both  the  member’s  cost  and  the  survivor’s annuity.  The base amount is increased at the same time and by the same COLA as the member’s retired pay.  The largest base amount (maximum coverage/full coverage) a member may elect is normally their gross retired pay.  However, if the member received a Career Status Bonus (CSB) (reference paragraph 5.1, below), they may elect a base amount up to the amount of retired pay the member could otherwise have been entitled to  receive had he/she not elected to receive the CSB.  The smallest base amount a member may elect is $300.  If their gross retired pay is less than  $300,  they  must  designate  the  whole  sum.    The  member  may  elect  any  dollar  amount between maximum coverage and $300. 5.1.  Base  Amount  Which  May  Be  Elected  by  Members  Who  Receive  the  CSB.    PL  106-65, 5 October 1999,  allows  members  with  a  Date  Initial  Entry  Military  Service  (DIEMS)  on  or after  1 August 1986  to  choose  one  of  two  retirement  options:    (1)    Retire  under  the  High-Three System and their retired pay multiplier will be 2.5 percent for each year of service; or (2)  Retire under the provisions of PL 99-348, 17 March 1986 (the 1986 Military Retirement Reform Act (MRRA) also knows as REDUX) and receive a $30,000 CSB at the completion of 15 years of active duty service.  If the member chooses to receive the CSB, they agree that their retired pay multiplier at retirement will be 2.5 percent for each year of service less one percent for each  year less than 30  years (restored to  the same  as the High-Three System  at age  62).    They  also  agreed  to  a  reduced  inflation  adjustment  equal  to  COLA  minus  one percent each year with a one-time catch-up at age 62, and then reverted back to COLA minus one percent each year thereafter. 5.2.  Base  Amount  When  Electing  Insurable  Interest  Coverage.    The  base  amount  for insurable interest coverage (reference paragraph 6.6) must be the member’s gross retired pay or,  if  the  member  received  a  CSB  at  the  completion  of  15  years  of  active  duty  service (reference paragraph 5.1), the amount of retired pay the member could otherwise have been entitled to receive had he/she not elected to receive the CSB. 5.3.  Only One Base Amount Authorized.  A member may not designate one base amount for the spouse or former spouse and another base amount for eligible child(ren) in a spouse and child or former spouse and child election. 5.4.  Base  Amount  When  Change  From  TDRL  to  PDRL.    If,  upon  change  from  TDRL  to PDRL,  the  member’s  retired  pay  is  reduced  to  less  than  the  current  base  amount,  the  new AFI36-3006  7 OCTOBER 2009 13 base amount must be the new gross retired pay entitlement.  If maximum coverage had been elected  and the member’s retired pay  entitlement is  increased  as a result  of the  change, the base amount will be increased to the member’s new gross retired pay entitlement.  Otherwise, the  member’s  base  amount  will  remain  the  same  regardless  of  a  change  in  retired  pay entitlement and only be increased by interim COLAs. 5.5.  Base Amount When Advanced in Grade After Retiring.  A member who elects maximum coverage at retirement and who is later advanced in grade on the retired list keeps maximum coverage;  therefore,  the  base  amount  is  increased  to  the  member’s  new  retired  pay entitlement.    When  the  election  is  for  reduced  coverage,  advancement  in  grade  will  not change the reduced base amount. 6.  Beneficiary Options.  A member may elect coverage for one of the following: Table 1.  Available Beneficiary Options and Levels of Coverage/Base Amounts. Beneficiary option Level of coverage Base amount Spouse Only (note 1)  Maximum SBP Coverage  Gross retired pay (note 5)  Reduced SBP Coverage Child Only (note 2) Maximum SBP Coverage Reduced SBP Coverage Spouse and Child (notes 1 and 2)  Maximum SBP Coverage Reduced SBP Coverage Former Spouse Only (note 1)  Maximum SBP Coverage Any dollar amount between $300 and the member’s gross retired pay (note 5) Gross retired pay (note 5)  Any dollar amount between $300 and the member’s gross retired pay (note 5)  Gross retired pay (note 5)  Any dollar amount between $300 and the member’s gross retired pay (note 5)  Gross retired pay (note 5)  14 AFI36-3006  7 OCTOBER 2009 Reduced SBP Coverage Former Spouse and Child (notes 1 and 3)  Maximum SBP Coverage Reduced SBP Coverage Insurable Interest (note 4) Maximum SBP Coverage Decline None.  Retired pay stops and survivors receive no benefits. Any dollar amount between $300 and the member’s gross retired pay (note 5)  Gross retired pay (note 5) Any dollar amount between $300 and the member’s gross retired pay (note 5) Gross retired pay (note 6)  None NOTES: 1.  A member may not cover both a current and a former spouse at the same time. 2.  Covers ALL the member’s eligible children. 3.  An election for former spouse and child coverage protects only the eligible children (reference paragraph 6.2.1 for definition of eligible child) resulting from the marriage of the member and that former spouse. 4.  An insurable interest election may be made only when there is no eligible spouse or dependent children at retirement.  Exception:  A member who does not have a spouse but has only one dependent child may elect insurable interest coverage for that child. 5.  If the member received a CSB at the completion of 15 years of active duty service (reference paragraph 5.1), that member may elect a base amount up to the amount of retired pay the member could otherwise have been entitled to receive had he/she not elected to receive the CSB. 6.  If the member received a CSB at the completion of 15 years of active duty service (reference paragraph 5.1), the base amount must be the amount of retired pay the member could otherwise have been entitled to receive had he/she not elected to receive the CSB. 6.1.  Spouse  Only  Coverage.    A  member  who  is  married  but  declines  spouse  coverage  at retirement  may  not  elect  spouse  coverage  after  retirement  for  the  same  or  a  later  acquired spouse except  when authorized during  an open  enrollment period (reference paragraph 28).  When two or more retirees name the same individual as an SBP spouse and/or former spouse beneficiary,  the  annuitant  may  receive  only  one  annuity  at  a  time  and  must  choose  which annuity to receive. 6.1.1.  Eligible Spouse.  A spouse married to the member on the date of retirement is an eligible  beneficiary  regardless  of  the  length  of  the  marriage.    A  spouse  married  to  the member  after  retirement  becomes  an  eligible  beneficiary  the  earlier  of  the  first anniversary of marriage, or the birth of a child of the marriage.  Adoption of the spouse’s child  prior  to  the  first  anniversary  of  marriage  does  not  satisfy  this  requirement (Comptroller  General  (CG)  Decision  B-257180,  29 September l994).    Exception:    A spouse divorced from the member who later  remarries the member becomes an  eligible beneficiary  immediately  upon  remarriage  if  the  member  had  elected  coverage  for  that spouse  at  retirement,  or  if  the  member  retired  before  21 September 1972  and  elected AFI36-3006  7 OCTOBER 2009 15 coverage  for  that  spouse  during  the  initial  SBP  enrollment  period  (21 September l972  - 20 March 1974). 6.1.2.  Spouse  Acquired  After  Retirement  When  No  Spouse  at  Retirement.    A  member who  is  unmarried  on  the  date  of  retirement  may  elect  spouse  SBP  coverage  if  he/she marries  after  retiring.    The  election  request  with  appropriate  documentation  (reference paragraph  4.4  and  attachment  8)  must  be  received  by  DFAS--CL  before  the  first anniversary of the marriage in order to be considered valid. 6.1.2.1.  Spouse  coverage  may  be  added  to  an  existing  election  for  child(ren).  Coverage then becomes spouse and child coverage.  A member with prior child only coverage  cannot  terminate  coverage  for  the  child  nor  increase  or  decrease  the previous base amount.  The eligible spouse (reference paragraph 6.1.1) becomes the primary beneficiary and eligible child(ren) become the contingent beneficiary. 6.1.2.2.  A  member  with  former  spouse  coverage  may  change  coverage  to  a  new spouse, child, or spouse and child only under conditions listed in paragraph 6.4.9, and with appropriate documentation listed in table 2 6.1.2.3.  A member may terminate insurable interest coverage to elect coverage for a new spouse before the  first  anniversary  of the marriage.  However, if the insurable interest beneficiary is  a former spouse (reference paragraph 6.6.9), the member may terminate coverage for the former spouse only with appropriate documentation listed in table 2. 6.1.3.  Changes  Authorized  in  Spouse  Coverage  After  Remarriage.    Spouse  coverage  is not terminated when the spouse loses eligibility (through death or divorce).  Instead, it is suspended  pending  the  member’s  remarriage.    Following  remarriage,  the  member  must notify DFAS-CL prior to the first anniversary of the new marriage (reference paragraph 4.4) and choose one of the following three options: 6.1.3.1.  Resume Suspended Coverage After Remarriage.  A member with suspended spouse  coverage  who  remarries  may  elect  to  resume  his/her  prior  level  of  SBP coverage.  The base amount, cost, and annuity amounts will have increased during the interim by applicable COLAs.  A member may not reduce the base amount, nor can child coverage be added or eliminated by virtue of this provision alone. 6.1.3.2.  Increase  Coverage  After  Remarriage.    A  member  with  suspended  spouse coverage, who previously had reduced coverage, may increase the base amount up to and  including  gross  retired  pay.    The  increase  will  also  apply  to  existing  child coverage, if any. 6.1.3.2.1.  The  member  must  pay  to  DFAS-CL  the  difference  between  the  SBP cost  for  existing  coverage  and  the  costs,  with  interest,  that  would  have  been incurred if the higher level of coverage had been  originally elected.  Payment of these  additional  premiums  and  interest  must  be  completed  prior  to  the  first anniversary  of  marriage  in  order  for  the  spouse  to  be  eligible  for  the  increased coverage.    Payments  may  be  deducted  from  the  member’s  retired  pay  if  the member so desires.  If payment is not completed prior to the first anniversary of marriage, the election increase is null and void and spouse coverage is resumed at the  previous  level  of  coverage.    If  this  occurs,  the  member  will  be  refunded  the 16 AFI36-3006  7 OCTOBER 2009 additional premiums and interest that may have been remitted. 6.1.3.2.1.1.  Should the member die prior to the first anniversary of marriage, the  election  for  increased  coverage  is  null  and  void,  and  any  payments  that had been remitted to increase the coverage will be refunded with the arrears of pay.    Additionally,  the  new  spouse  will  NOT  be  paid  an  annuity  unless  the spouse is an eligible beneficiary (reference paragraph 6.1.1) on the member’s date of death, in which case the annuity would be based on the previous level of coverage.  Otherwise, no spouse annuity is payable. 6.1.3.3.  Terminate Suspended Spouse Coverage  After Remarriage.   A member with suspended  spouse  coverage  may  elect  not  to  resume  spouse  coverage  upon remarriage.  This election will not affect existing child coverage, if any.  To be valid, the  request  to  terminate  suspended  spouse  coverage  must  be  received  by  DFAS-CL before  the  first  anniversary  of  the  remarriage.    An  election  under  this  paragraph  is irrevocable. 6.1.4.  Effects  of  Failure  to  Comply  With  Provisions  of  Paragraph  6.1.3  Following Remarriage.  Failure to notify DFAS-CL of the remarriage prior to the first anniversary of  the  new  marriage  will  result  in  the  prior  level  of  coverage  being  automatically reinstated  effective  the  date  the  new  spouse  becomes  an  eligible  beneficiary.    If  the notification is  not timely, when DFAS-CL is  later notified or obtains verification of the remarriage,  a  debt  of  delinquent  premiums  plus  interest  will  be  levied  against  the member. 6.2.  Child Only Coverage.  A member who has an eligible dependent child(ren), but declines child  coverage  at  retirement,  may  not  elect  child  coverage  after  retirement  for  the  same  or later acquired child(ren) except  during an open enrollment period (reference paragraph 28).  In an election for child only coverage, only one annuity is payable.  If there is more than one eligible child (reference paragraph 6.2.1 for definition of eligible child) the annuity is divided in equal shares (reference paragraph 17 and Figure 5). 6.2.1.  Eligible  Child(ren).    Children  are  eligible  for  SBP  annuity  payments  as  long  as they  are  unmarried  and  under  age  18  (including  children  under  18  who  are  serving  on active duty in the Uniformed Services); unmarried and at least 18 but under 22 and a full-time student in an accredited school (paragraph 6.2.2, below); enrolled in an institution of higher  learning  under  a  military  subsistence  scholarship;  or  serving  as  a  cadet  or midshipman at  a service academy.  A child continues to  be considered a student during the  interim  between  school  semesters,  but  not  for  periods  longer  than  150  days.    While pursuing a full-time course of study or training, a child whose 22nd birthday occurs before 1 July or after 31 August of a calendar year is considered to be 22 years of age on the first day of July after that birthday. 6.2.1.1.  A  dependent  child  may  be  a  natural  child,  adopted  child,  stepchild, grandchild, foster child, or ward who lived with the member in a regular parent-child relationship.  To qualify as a dependent child, a grandchild, foster child, or ward must have been in the care and custody of the member by court order at the time of death, receiving over one-half of his or her support from the member, and not be cared for under a social agency contract.  If financial support by other than the retiree is court-ordered, it cannot exceed one-half of the child’s total support. AFI36-3006  7 OCTOBER 2009 17 6.2.1.2.  A child who is disabled and incapable of self-support remains eligible for life or  as  long  as  disabled  and  unmarried  if  the  disability  occurred  before  age  18  (or before age 22 if a full-time student when the disability occurred). 6.2.1.3.  Marriage  at  any  age  permanently  terminates  a  child’s  eligibility  for  an annuity, including an incapacitated child entering into a valid marriage with another incapacitated  individual  (CG  Decision  B-221945,  4  August  1986).    However,  if  a child’s  marriage  is  ended  not  by  divorce  or  death  of  the  spouse,  but  rather  by  an annulment  or  judicial  decree  that  voids  the  marriage,  the  child’s  coverage  may  be reinstated.    The  member  must  notify  DFAS-CL  and  provide  proper  documentation (reference paragraph 4.4 and attachment 8). 6.2.1.4.  All the member’s dependent children are covered beneficiaries in an election for  child  only  or  spouse  and  child  coverage,  including  child(ren)  from  previous marriages.  The member cannot  exclude  a specific child or children from  receiving  the annuity.  However, if child coverage is added to former spouse coverage, only the children resulting from the marriage of the member to that former spouse are covered. 6.2.1.5.  Child  coverage,  which  has  been  suspended  because  the  last  eligible  child between the ages of 18 and 22 no longer attends school full-time, is reinstated if the child reenters school on a full-time basis. 6.2.1.6.  A new child(ren), added to an existing election for child coverage, becomes an eligible beneficiary(ies) on the date  acquired  by the member.  The member must notify  DFAS-CL  and  provide  proper  documentation  (reference  paragraph  4.4  and attachment 8). 6.2.1.7.  Eligible  child(ren)  can  be  covered  under  more  than  one  SBP  (e.g.,  both military  parents  may  elect  SBP  coverage  for  the  child(ren)  (reference  paragraph 3.6.2). 6.2.1.8.  If  an  eligible  child  is  adopted  after  the  death  of  the  member,  the  adoption does not terminate the child’s entitlement to the SBP annuity. 6.2.1.9.  A member may terminate insurable interest coverage to elect coverage for a new  child  within  the  first  year  of  acquiring  the  eligible  child  (reference  paragraph 6.2.1  for  definition  of  an  eligible  child).    However,  if  the  insurable  interest beneficiary is the former spouse, the member may terminate coverage for the former spouse to elect coverage for a new child only with appropriate documentation listed in table 2. 6.2.2.  Accredited  Schools.    Accredited  schools  include  high  school,  trade  school, technical  or  vocational  institute,  junior  college,  college,  university,  or  comparable recognized educational institute (the final decision will be made by DFAS-CL when the SBP annuity application is processed). 6.2.3.  Child(ren)  Acquired  After  Retirement  When  No  Eligible  Child  at  Retirement.    A member  who  did  not  have  an  eligible  child  on  the  date  of  retirement  may  provide coverage for a child(ren) acquired after retirement.  An election must be filed within the first year after acquiring the first child in order to provide coverage (reference paragraph 4.4.  and  attachment  8).    Coverage  is  effective  upon  receipt  of  the  election  request  by 18 AFI36-3006  7 OCTOBER 2009 DFAS-CL.    If  spouse  coverage  was  previously  elected,  the  new  election  must  be  for spouse and child coverage. 6.3.  Spouse and Child Coverage.  Reference paragraph 6.1.1 for definition of eligible spouse and paragraph 6.2.1 for definition of eligible child(ren).   Only one annuity is payable under the  spouse  and  child  option.    The  spouse  is  the  primary  beneficiary.    If  the  spouse  loses eligibility due to death or remarriage prior to age 55, the annuity is paid in equal shares to the remaining  eligible  children.    When  the  last  eligible  child  loses  eligibility,  the  SBP  annuity stops pending the end of the spouse’s disqualifying marriage. 6.4.  Former Spouse Coverage.    This paragraph applies to former spouse elections effective on  or  after  1 March 1986  and  elections  converted  from  former  spouse  coverage  of  the insurable  interest  type  to  former  spouse  coverage  of  the  spouse  type.    Refer  to  paragraph 6.6.9  for  information  on  former  spouse  coverage  of  the  insurable  interest  type  that  was established prior to 1 March 1986. 6.4.1.  A former spouse election precludes payment of an annuity to a spouse. 6.4.2.  When two or more retirees name the same individual as a spouse or former spouse SBP beneficiary, the annuitant may receive only one annuity at a time and must choose which annuity to receive. 6.4.3.  Former Spouse Election by Retiring Member.  A member who has a former spouse may  elect  to  provide  SBP  coverage  for  that  former  spouse  upon  retiring.    If  a  retiring member is  married and  elects  SBP coverage for  a former spouse, the member’s  current spouse  must  be  notified  of  the  election  (reference  attachment  5);  however,  neither  the spouse’s nor the former spouse’s concurrence is required on the DD Form 2656. 6.4.3.1.  A  retiring  member  may  elect  child  SBP  coverage  in  conjunction  with  a former spouse election (paragraph 6.5, below). 6.4.4.  Changing  from  Spouse  to  Former  Spouse  Coverage  When  Divorced  After Retirement.  A retired member with spouse coverage who divorces may elect, within the first  year  following  divorce,  to  change  the  election  from  spouse  coverage  to  former spouse  coverage.    A  person  who  was  the  member’s  former  spouse  when  the  member retired may not be named a beneficiary under this paragraph.  An eligible former spouse is  a  person,  who  was  the  member’s  spouse  on  the  date  the  member  became  entitled  to retired pay, and was divorced from the member after the member retired; or married the member after retirement and remained married to the member for at least one year before becoming divorced; or married the member after retirement and became divorced within one year, but is the parent of issue of that marriage.  A retired member who does not have spouse coverage cannot elect former spouse coverage under this paragraph. 6.4.4.1.  If the member was ordered by a court to elect former spouse coverage before 14 November l986,  a  second  court  order,  issued  on  or  after  14 November l986, enforcing  the  original  order  which  requires  a  former  spouse  election,  constitutes  a modification  of  the  previous  order  and  establishes  a  new  one-year  period  during which the election can be changed from spouse to former spouse coverage.  However, a modification of a court order dated after 14 November 1986 that merely restates the previous  provision  and  imposes  no  new  obligation  on  the  member  does  not  begin  a new  one-year  period.    A  subsequent  court  order  holding  a  member  in  contempt  of AFI36-3006  7 OCTOBER 2009 19 court for failing to fulfill the prior agreement cannot be used to begin a new one-year period (CG Decision B-244101, 3 August 1992).  In these cases, the member should be  advised  that,  in  some  cases,  a  correction  of  military  record  may  be  an  avenue  of administrative appeal. 6.4.4.2.  A  valid  election  for  former  spouse  coverage  terminates  any  previous coverage and prevents payment of an annuity to a spouse. 6.4.4.3.  The SBP base amount cannot be changed nor can the court award a level of coverage greater than the base amount before the divorce. 6.4.4.4.  A retired member may elect child SBP coverage in conjunction with former spouse coverage (paragraph 6.5, below). 6.4.5.  DD  Form  2656-1,  Survivor  Benefit  Plan  (SBP)  Election  Statement  For  Former Spouse Coverage.  To request former spouse coverage either at retirement or following a divorce after retirement, a completed DD Form 2656-1, signed by both the member and the former spouse, must be submitted to DFAS-CL with a copy of the finalized divorce decree including property settlement (if applicable), setting forth whether: 6.4.5.1.  The  election  is  being  made  pursuant  to  the  requirements  of  a  court  order incident to a proceeding of divorce, dissolution, or annulment; or 6.4.5.2.  The  election  is  being  made  pursuant  to  a  written  agreement  entered  into voluntarily by the member as part of or incident  to  a proceeding of divorce, but  the agreement  was not  incorporated in,  ratified, or approved by a court order.  Both  the member and former spouse must sign and date the written agreement statement; or 6.4.5.3.  The member is making the election voluntarily (not required by a court order or written agreement). 6.4.6.  Deemed Election Request by a Former Spouse for SBP Coverage.  If a member is required to elect former spouse SBP coverage either to comply with a court order dated after  13 November l986  or  written  agreement  filed  with  the  court  of  appropriate jurisdiction in  accordance with  applicable State law, and the member fails or  refuses to do so, former spouse coverage may still be established by DFAS-CL if the former spouse submits  a  valid  deemed  election  request  within  one  year  after  the  date  of  the  decree  of divorce,  dissolution,  or  annulment.    This  method  does  not  require  the  member’s  active participation. 6.4.6.1.  A  deemed  election  is  a  letter  submitted  by  the  former  spouse  to  DFAS-CL requesting that an election for former spouse SBP coverage be deemed to have been made.  The former spouse must make the request within one year of the divorce or it cannot  be  honored.    If  an  election  for  former  spouse  coverage  was  agreed  to  or ordered  by  an  earlier  court  order,  a  subsequent  order  or  modification  that  merely restates  the  previous  provision  and  imposes  no  new  obligation  on  the  member  does not  begin  a  new  one-year  period.    A  subsequent  court  order  holding  a  member  in contempt of court for failing to fulfill the prior agreement cannot be used to begin a new one-year period to deem an election (reference paragraph 6.4.4.1). 6.4.6.2.  The  former  spouse’s  request  must  include  the  following:    member’s  name; SSN; whether the member is retired or on active duty; the former spouse’s full name; 20 AFI36-3006  7 OCTOBER 2009 SSN; date of birth; and mailing address, and a certified copy of the court order issued after 13 November l986 which requires the member to elect to provide an annuity to the  former  spouse;  or  a  certified  copy  of  the  member’s  written  agreement  to  make such  an  election  along  with  a  statement  from  the  clerk  of  the  court  or  other appropriate  official  that  the  written  agreement  was  filed  with  the  court  as  the applicable state law requires. 6.4.6.3.  No election may be deemed to have been made which could never have been made  by  the  member  concerned    (e.g.,  if  the  retiree  did  not  previously  have  spouse coverage,  former  spouse  coverage  cannot  be  deemed  following  a  divorce).  Furthermore,  a  request  for  a  deemed  election  will  be  rejected  if  the  court  order contains language that is otherwise unenforceable. 6.4.6.4.  If more than one former spouse makes a qualifying request, the first request received with complete documentation is the one honored. 6.4.6.5.  Since  1 March 1986,  a  former  spouse  may  request  child  coverage  in conjunction with a deemed election. 6.4.7.  Former Spouse Coverage Suspended.  Former spouse coverage is suspended if the former spouse remarries before age 55.  In order to suspend the premiums, the member must  include  a  copy  of  the  former  spouse’s  remarriage  certificate  with  notification  to DFAS-CL.    While  the  former  spouse  coverage  is  suspended,  the  election  cannot  be changed or terminated unless the member files a valid election to change to spouse, child, or spouse and child coverage (paragraph 6.4.9, below) or the former spouse dies.  If the member  dies  during  the  period  the  former  spouse’s  coverage  is  suspended  because  of remarriage before age 55, the former spouse would be eligible for an annuity in the event the disqualifying remarriage subsequently terminates. 6.4.8.  Suspended  Former  Spouse  Coverage  Reinstated.    Former  spouse  coverage suspended as a result of the former spouse’s remarriage prior to age 55 is reinstated if the former  spouse’s  remarriage  terminates  unless  in  the  interim  the  member  filed  a  valid election  to  change  to  spouse,  child,  or  spouse  and  child  coverage  (paragraph  6.4.9, below).    To  reinstate  suspended  former  spouse  coverage,  the  member  must  provide DFAS-CL documentation that shows the former spouse’s marriage has terminated (e.g., divorce  decree  or  the  death  certificate  of  the  person  to  whom  the  former  spouse  was married) (reference paragraph 4.4.1). 6.4.9.  Changing  Former  Spouse  to  Spouse,  Child,  or  Spouse  and  Child  Coverage.    A member  may  request  former  spouse  coverage  be  changed  to  cover  a  spouse,  child,  or spouse and child by submitting a signed letter of request with appropriate documentation (reference  table  6.2)  to  DFAS-CL.    An  election  request  for  child  coverage  must  be received by DFAS-CL within one year of acquiring the eligible child(ren).  A request to change an election from former spouse to spouse coverage may be made at any time after the member remarries without regard to the one-year time limitation previously imposed by  Federal  statute  (reference  PL  105-85,  National  Defense  Authorization  Act  for  Fiscal Year  1998,  18 November 1997).    The  former  spouse  coverage  is  terminated  when  the spouse  becomes  an  eligible  beneficiary  (reference  paragraph  6.1.1).    If  the  member remarries the former spouse, the former spouse immediately becomes an eligible spouse beneficiary.  This applies whether or not the former spouse coverage was court ordered, AFI36-3006  7 OCTOBER 2009 21 required  by  a  written  agreement,  or  voluntary.    If  court  ordered,  no  amended/modified court order is required. 6.4.9.1.  If the election change request is received by DFAS-CL within the first  year of  remarriage,  the  previous  level  of  coverage  can  be  increased  (reference  paragraph 6.1.3.2).    However,  if  the  member  requests  the  election  change  after  one  year  of remarriage, the base amount cannot be changed, and the spouse coverage is effective on the date the election change request is received by DFAS-CL. 6.4.10.  Former Spouse Coverage Terminated.  Former spouse coverage is terminated in the event of the former spouse’s death. Table 2.  Documentation Required to Terminate Former Spouse Coverage in Order to Elect Spouse, Child, or Spouse and Child Coverage. If former spouse election was: Required by court order incident to a proceeding of divorce, dissolution, or annulment Required by a written agreement that was not incorporated in a court order Voluntary Any of the above, and the former spouse dies In order to change that election, the following is required: The retired member must furnish DFAS-CL a written request with a certified copy of a court order that amends/modifies all previous court orders relating to such election so as to permit the member to change the election.  Exception:  If the member remarries the covered former spouse, no amended/modified court order is required to change the election to spouse coverage. The member must furnish DFAS-CL a written request with a notarized statement signed by the former spouse that evidences the former spouse's agreement with termination of coverage and certified by the member that the statement is current and in effect.  The member must furnish DFAS-CL a written request.  In this case, the former spouse’s concurrence is not required in the change; however, the former spouse will be notified by DFAS-CL of the termination of former spouse coverage. Copy of the former spouse’s death certificate. 6.5.  Former  Spouse  and  Child  Coverage.    A  member  who  elects  former  spouse  SBP coverage  may  also  elect  to  provide  coverage  for  eligible  children.    Only  one  annuity  is payable  under  the  former  spouse  and  child  option.    The  former  spouse  is  the  primary beneficiary.  If the former spouse loses eligibility due to death or remarriage prior to age 55, the  annuity  is  paid  in  equal  shares  to  any  eligible  children  (reference  paragraph  6.2.1  for definition of an eligible child).  In a former spouse and child election, only eligible children resulting  from  the  marriage  of  the  member  and  that  former  spouse  are  covered.    When  the last eligible child loses eligibility, SBP payments stop.    If the  former spouse lost eligibility due  to  remarriage  prior  to  age  55,  the  former  spouse  would  again  become  eligible  for  the annuity if the disqualifying marriage ends.  This paragraph applies to former spouse elections effective on or after 1 March 1986 and elections converted from former spouse coverage of the  insurable  interest  type  to  former  spouse  coverage  of  the  spouse  type.    Reference paragraph 6.6.9 for former spouse coverage of the insurable interest type. 22 AFI36-3006  7 OCTOBER 2009 6.5.1.  Changing from Former Spouse and Child to  Spouse, Child, or Spouse and Child Coverage.  A member may change former spouse and child coverage to spouse, child, or spouse and child coverage under the conditions described in paragraph 6.4.9.  An election for  child  or  spouse  and  child  coverage  includes  all  the  member’s  eligible  children (reference paragraph 6.2.1 for definition of an eligible child). 6.6.  Insurable  Interest  Coverage.    A  member,  who  has  neither  a  spouse  nor  a  dependent child at  retirement, may  elect  SBP  coverage  for  a natural  person  with  an insurable interest.  (Exception:  A person who does not have a spouse at retirement and has only one dependent child may elect insurable interest coverage for that dependent child [CG Decision B-179465, 19 July l974]).    However,  the  member  may  not  by-pass  one  dependent  child  and  elect coverage  for  another  insurable  interest  person.    An  insurable  interest  person  (also  called natural  person  with  an  insurable  interest)  is  one  who  has  a  basis  to  expect  some  financial benefit or advantage from the continuance of the member’s life.  This can be either a family member or a non-related person. 6.6.1.  Family  members  with  an  insurable  interest  include  a  parent,  stepparent, grandparent,  grandchild,  brother,  sister,  aunt,  uncle,  cousin,  one  dependent  child  who would  have  qualified  under  paragraph  6.2.1  (reference  paragraph  6.6,  above),  or  a  non-dependent  child  (e.g.,  adult  capable  of  self-support).    Non-related  insurable  interest parties may include a close business associate, who would be financially affected by the member’s death, a business partner, a joint property owner, etc.  Documentation that an insurable  interest  exists  is  required  for  all  non-related  persons  and  family  members related as distantly as a cousin.  If the election is subsequently disapproved by DFAS-CL (because it is determined the person designated is not an eligible beneficiary), any costs collected will be refunded to the member. 6.6.2.  Only one person can be named as an insurable interest beneficiary. 6.6.3.  A member with no spouse and no dependent child, who has several adult children, can elect insurable interest coverage for one of those adult children, or can bypass those adult children and elect coverage for another insurable interest beneficiary (e.g., brother, sister, etc.). 6.6.4.  An insurable interest beneficiary’s SBP eligibility is not affected by that person’s age, student status, financial, or marital status. 6.6.5.  A member must elect maximum coverage (reference paragraph 5.2) when electing insurable interest coverage. 6.6.6.  A  former  spouse  could  not  be  named  a  beneficiary  under  this  option  after 1 March l986 (reference paragraph 6.6.9, below). 6.6.7.  Insurable  Interest  Authorized  Changes.    Insurable  interest  coverage  can  be changed to  coverage for a spouse and/or dependent  child(ren) acquired after retirement.  The member must make the election change within 1 year of acquiring the spouse and/or child(ren).    A  member  changing  from  insurable  interest  coverage  to  spouse,  child,  or spouse and child may change the base amount at the same time.  The costs for insurable interest coverage stop effective the date costs for the new coverage become effective. 6.6.8.  Terminating Insurable Interest Coverage. AFI36-3006  7 OCTOBER 2009 23 6.6.8.1.  Coverage  terminates  upon  the  death  of  the  covered  insurable  interest beneficiary.  The member must provide a copy  of the death  certificate  to  DFAS-CL (DFAS-CL, U.S. Military Retirement Pay, PO Box 7130, London KY  40742-7130).  The member may not name another insurable interest beneficiary. 6.6.8.2.  Insurable  interest  coverage  for  a  person  who  is  not  the  member’s  former spouse can be arbitrarily discontinued at any time by submitting a written request to DFAS-CL.  The member’s written request must be signed, include his/her SSN, and state  that  the  member  wants  to  terminate  SBP  participation.    A  request  for information  will  not  be  considered  a  request  to  terminate  SBP  participation.    When DFAS-CL receives a request to terminate coverage under this provision, the member will  be  mailed  a  cover  letter  with  fact  sheets  that  explain  the  advantages  and disadvantages  of  participation  and  the  disadvantages  of  terminating  participation.  The member has 30 days from the date of the cover letter to withdraw a termination request.    If  the  member  does  not  respond  within  the  prescribed  30-day  period,  the member’s  participation  will  be  terminated  effective  the  first  day  of  the  month following  the  month  in  which  the  member’s  request  was  received  by  DFAS-CL.  When  coverage  is  terminated  under  this  provision,  another  insurable  interest beneficiary cannot be named. 6.6.8.3.  A  member  who  terminates  insurable  interest  coverage  may  subsequently elect coverage for a new spouse or dependent child within one year of acquiring the eligible family member. 6.6.9.  Insurable  Interest  Elections  for  Former  Spouse  Coverage.    Elections  for  former spouse coverage under the insurable interest option were permitted for retiring members after  8 September l982  and  for  retired  members  after  24 September  l983.    As  of 1 March 1986,  no  new  elections  for  former  spouse  coverage  under  this  option  were permitted.  Participants were given the opportunity to change insurable interest elections for  former  spouse  coverage  to  coverage  under  the  same  provisions  (options,  cost,  and annuity  payment)  as  spouse  coverage  during  a  one-year  period  (8 November  1985  - 7 November 1986) if the former spouse concurred in the change.  As of 1 March 1986, all new former spouse elections are under the same provisions as spouse coverage (reference paragraph 6.4). 6.6.9.1.  Former  spouse  elections  of  the  insurable  interest  type  could  not  have  been ordered by the divorce court unless the member had agreed to provide SBP coverage for the former spouse. 6.6.9.2.  The election could not include child coverage. 6.6.9.3.  Changing  Insurable  Interest  Elections  for  Former  Spouse  Coverage  to Spouse, Child, or Spouse and Child Coverage.  A member may change former spouse elections of the insurable interest type to coverage for a spouse, child, or spouse and child under the same conditions described in paragraph 6.4.9. Section C—Coverage Costs 7.  General  Premium  Information.  DFAS-CL  deducts  monthly  SBP  premiums  from  a participant’s  retired  pay  in  accordance  with  DoD  Financial  Management  Regulation  (FMR), 24 AFI36-3006  7 OCTOBER 2009 volume 7B, Military Pay Policy and Procedures For Retired Pay.  Premiums are deducted when there  is  an  eligible  beneficiary  (reference  paragraph  14).    Premiums  deducted  from  retired  pay are not subject to Federal income tax.  COLAs applied to the member’s military retired pay also apply to his/her SBP premiums.  Participants who waive military retired pay must remit monthly premiums directly to DFAS-CL.  A member whose retired pay is offset by VA compensation for a  service-connected  disability  may  submit  a  DD  Form  2891,  Authorization  for  Retired Serviceman’s  Family  Protection  Plan  (RSFPP)  and/or  Survivor  Benefit  Plan  (SBP)  Costs Deduction,  to  the  VA  to  request    the  premiums  be  deducted  from  the  member’s  VA  disability compensation.  If a member is placed in a retired pay status effective on a date other than the first day of a month (such as TDRL or PDRL) and participates in the SBP, premiums begin the first day of the following month (reference paragraph 3.10.2). 8.  Premiums  for  Spouse  Coverage.  One of two formulas may be used to compute premiums for spouse coverage.  For all members who initially entered active duty after 28 February 1990 and who are not retiring for disability, the only formula used for computing spouse premiums is 6.5 percent of the base amount (reference paragraph 5 for definition of base amount).  However, a previous formula (referred to herein as the ―old formula‖) may be used if more beneficial for members  who  initially  entered  active  duty  on  or  before  28 February 1990,  and  members  who retire  for  disability  (regardless  of  the  date  of  entry  on  active  duty).    The  old  formula  is  2.5 percent  of  the  threshold  amount  (reference  paragraph  8.1,  below,  for  definition  of  threshold amount), plus  10 percent of the base amount in  excess  of the threshold amount.  1.   Threshold Amount.    The  threshold  amount  is  the  low-cost  portion  of  the  base  amount  multiplied  by  2.5 percent when the old  formula is used.  The threshold amount was $300 until 28 February l986, and has risen since then by active duty pay increases.  After a member’s retirement, the threshold amount  is  increased  by  COLAs  applied  to  the  member’s  retired  pay.    Table  3.,  below,  lists  a history  of  all  threshold  amounts  through  1 January 2007  with  effective  dates.    Contact AFPC/DPPRT  for  subsequent  threshold  amount  information.    Figure  3.,  below,  shows  sample spouse premium computations using both the old and new formulas. Table 3.  History of Threshold Amounts.

Suspension or Reinstatement of Spouse Premiums. 8.2.1.  Suspension  of  Spouse  Premiums.    Premiums  for  spouse  coverage  are  suspended the first day of the month following the date of the loss of the spouse beneficiary due to divorce,  death,  or  annulment.    If  the  member  fails  to  advise  DFAS-CL  in  a  timely manner,  any  refund  of  premiums  he/she  paid  after  the  spouse  lost  eligibility  may  be subject to the 6-year statute of limitation. 8.2.2.  Reinstatement  of  Spouse  Premiums  after  Remarriage.    Unless  a  member  with suspended  spouse  coverage  elects  to  terminate  spouse  coverage  after  remarriage (reference  paragraph  6.1.3.3),  spouse  costs  resume  effective  the  first  day  of  the  month following the date the new spouse becomes an eligible beneficiary (reference paragraph 6.1.1).  (Exception:  If the spouse becomes an eligible beneficiary on the first day of the month, costs are collected for that month.)  If a member elects to increase the SBP base amount upon remarriage, refer to paragraph 6.1.3.2. 26 AFI36-3006  7 OCTOBER 2009 9.  Premiums  for  Child  Only  Coverage.  To  compute  child  only  costs,  multiply  the  base amount by the cost  factor from  the SBP Child Only cost  factor table (each SBP counselor will maintain a copy of the cost factor table) using the ages of the member and the youngest child on their birthdays nearest the effective date of the election.  See Figure 2., below, for a sample child only premium computation.  A disabled child, age 18 or older, is considered to be age 17 for cost factor  purposes.    Age  17  is  also  used  when  there  is  an  incapacitated  child  over  age  18  and  a competent child also over age 18 but younger than the incapacitated child. Figure 2.  Sample Child Only Premium Computation. Using a $1,000 base amount Base amount Child cost factor for member age 48 and youngest child age 12 Monthly cost   $1,000  X .0031     $3.10 9.1.  Adding an Additional Child.  Adding a child acquired after retirement to the member’s original  election  for  child  only  coverage  will  not  change  the  cost  unless  coverage  and premiums  are suspended because all previously  designated children have become ineligible (paragraph 9.3.2, below). 9.2.  Child(ren) Acquired After Retirement When No Eligible Child At Retirement. 9.2.1.  A  member  without  a  dependent  child  on  retirement  may  provide  coverage  for  a child  acquired  after  that  date  (reference  paragraph  6.2.3).    The  election  must  be  filed within the first year after acquiring the first child.  Costs for the child coverage begin the first day of the month following the date the election is received by DFAS-CL. 9.3.  Suspension or Reinstatement of Child Premiums. 9.3.1.  Suspension  of  Child  Premiums.    The  member  may  provide  a  written  request  to DFAS-CL  to  suspend  child  coverage  if  the  last  remaining  eligible  child  marries,  if  the last eligible child between the ages of 18 or 22 is not enrolled as a full-time student, or if the  disabled  child  over  18  becomes  capable  of  self-support  (reference  paragraph  6.2.1).  Premiums for child coverage are suspended effective the first day of the month following the  end  of  the  child’s  eligibility.    If  the  last  eligible  child  age  18  or  older  becomes ineligible  because  of  not  attending  school  on  a  full-time  basis,  it  is  the  member’s responsibility  to  notify  DFAS-CL  of  the  last  date  the  child  attended  school.    If  a  child loses  eligibility  due  to  marriage,  a  copy  of  the  marriage  certificate  is  required.    If  the child  dies,  a  copy  of  the  death  certificate  is  required  (reference  paragraph  4.4  and attachment 8). 9.3.2.  Reinstatement of Child Premiums.  If child premiums had been suspended because all children previously covered became ineligible and the member acquires a child(ren), the  cost  is  recomputed  based  on  the  ages  of  the  member  and  youngest  newly  acquired child on their birthdays nearest the date the child is acquired. 9.3.2.1.  Cost  for  child  coverage  suspended  because  the  child  no  longer  attended school full-time may be reinstated if the unmarried child between the ages of 18 and 22  reenters  school  on  a  full-time  basis.    Cost  is  effective  the  first  day  of  the  month AFI36-3006  7 OCTOBER 2009 27 after the date the child resumes school attendance.  To reinstate coverage, the member notifies DFAS-CL of the date the child reenters school (reference paragraph 4.4). 9.4.  Recomputation of Child Costs When Spouse Coverage Is Added.  A member who had no eligible spouse at retirement and elected child only coverage who later marries may elect to add the new spouse  within the first  year of marriage (reference paragraph 6.1.2).  The new election must be for spouse and child coverage, and the child cost will be recalculated.  Any additional children acquired as a result of the remarriage would also be covered. To compute the new child cost, multiply the base amount times the cost factor from the SBP Spouse and Child  cost  factor    table  (each  SBP  counselor  will  maintain  a  copy  of  the  cost  factor  table) using the ages of the member, spouse, and youngest child on their birthdays nearest the date the new spouse becomes an eligible beneficiary, and add this cost to the spouse portion of the cost  (reference  paragraph  8).    The  recalculated  cost  is  effective  the  first  day  of  the  month following the month in which the spouse becomes an eligible beneficiary. 10.  Premiums for Spouse and Child Coverage.  Monthly premiums for the spouse portion of the coverage are computed as shown in paragraph 8.  A charge for the child coverage is added to the  spouse  premium.    To  compute  the  child  portion  of  the  premium,  multiply  the  base  amount times the cost factor from the SBP Spouse and Child cost factor table (each SBP counselor will maintain a copy of the cost factor table) using the ages of the member, spouse, and the youngest child  on  their  birthdays  nearest  the  effective  date  of  the  election.    See  Figure  3.,  below,  for  a sample spouse and child premium computation. Figure 3.  Sample Spouse and Child Premium Computation. Using a $1,500 base amount Member’s age 48, spouse’s age 45, and youngest child’s age 12 Base Amount  Spouse Cost:  Base Amount Cost factor for child Child Cost    $1,500   X .065   $97.50    $1,500 X.00016         .24 Total Cost $97.74 10.1.  Suspension or Reinstatement of Spouse and Child Premiums. 10.1.1.  Suspension  of  Spouse  and/or  Child  Premiums.    The  spouse  portion  of  the premium is suspended effective the first day of the month following the date the spouse beneficiary loses eligibility.  The election reverts to child only coverage while there is no eligible spouse.  The cost for the child portion of the coverage is recomputed at that time.  To compute the child cost in this case, multiply the base amount by the cost factor from the  SBP  Child  Only  cost  factor  table  (each  SBP  counselor  will  maintain  a  copy  of  the cost factor table) using the ages of the member and the youngest child on their birthdays nearest the date of the loss of the spouse beneficiary.  The recalculated cost for the child coverage becomes effective the first day of the month following the date of the loss of the 28 AFI36-3006  7 OCTOBER 2009 spouse beneficiary.  The  child  portion  of  the  premium  is  suspended  effective  the  first  day  of  the  month following  the  date  the  last  remaining  child  loses  eligibility  (reference  paragraph  9.3.1.) and the election reverts to spouse only coverage as long as there are no eligible children. 10.1.2.  Reinstatement of Spouse and/or Child Premiums.  Reference paragraph 8.2.2 for reinstatement of the spouse portion of the premiums following a remarriage.  The election reverts back to spouse and child coverage.  The child portion of the cost is recalculated at that time.  To compute the child portion of the cost when an eligible spouse beneficiary is added, multiply the base amount by the cost factor from the SBP Spouse and Child cost factor table (each SBP counselor will maintain a copy of the cost factor table) using the ages  of  the  member,  spouse,  and  youngest  child  on  their  birthdays  nearest  the  effective date of the election.  That premium is added to the spouse premium. 10.1.2.1.  If the child portion of the premium had been suspended because all children previously covered became ineligible and the member acquires a new child(ren), the election reverts back to spouse and child coverage if there is also an eligible spouse.  To compute the child portion of the cost, multiply the base amount by the cost factor from the SBP Spouse and Child cost factor table (each SBP counselor will maintain a copy  of  the  cost  factor  table)  using  the  nearest  ages  of  the  member,  spouse  and youngest child on their birthdays nearest the date the child is acquired.  That premium is added to the spouse cost.  The change in cost is effective the first day of the month after the date the new child is acquired. 11.  Premiums  for  Former  Spouse  Coverage.  Former  spouse  premiums  are  computed  using the same formulas used to compute spouse costs (reference paragraph 8). 11.1.  Suspension, Termination, or Reinstatement of Former Spouse Premiums. 11.1.1.  Suspension  or  Termination  of  Former  Spouse  Premiums.  Former  spouse coverage is suspended if the former spouse remarries before age 55.  Premiums can be suspended  by  sending  a  copy  of  the  former  spouse’s  marriage  certificate  with  written notification  to  DFAS-CL  (reference  paragraph  4.4.1).    Former  spouse  coverage  is terminated  if  the  former  spouse  dies.    The  member  must  send  a  copy  of  the  former spouse’s  death  certificate  with  written  notification  to  DFAS-CL  to  terminate  the premiums  (reference  paragraph  4.4.1).    Premiums  stop  the  first  day  of  the  month  after the  date  there  is  no  longer  an  eligible  former  spouse  beneficiary.    If  the  member  dies during  the  period  the  former  spouse  coverage  is  suspended  because  of  the  former spouse’s remarriage before age 55, the former spouse becomes eligible for the annuity in the  event   Appropriate documentation must be provided to DFAS-CL, (DFAS-CL, U.S. Military Annuitant Pay, PO Box 7131, London KY  40742-7031) with an application for the annuity. the  disqualifying  remarriage  subsequently terminates. 11.1.2.  Reinstatement of Former Spouse Premiums.  Premiums suspended as a result of the former spouse’s remarriage prior to age 55 are reinstated effective the first day of the month after the date the former spouse’s remarriage terminates, unless in the interim the member  had  filed  a  valid  election  to  change  to  spouse,  child,  or  spouse  and  child coverage with  appropriate documentation (reference paragraph 6.4.9 and table 6-2).  To reinstate  former  spouse  premiums,  the  member  should  include  a  copy  of  the  former spouse’s divorce decree or the death certificate of the person to whom the former spouse AFI36-3006  7 OCTOBER 2009 29 was married, whichever is appropriate, with written notification to DFAS-CL (reference paragraph 4.4.1). 12.  Premiums  for  Former  Spouse  and  Child  Coverage.  Cost  for  former  spouse  and  child coverage  are  computed  using  the  same  formulas  used  to  compute  costs  for  spouse  and  child coverage (reference paragraph 10). 12.1.  Suspension, Termination, or Reinstatement of Former Spouse and Child Premiums. 12.1.1.  Suspension or Termination of Former Spouse and Child Premiums.  The former spouse portion of the cost is suspended if the former spouse remarries before age 55 and terminated  if  the  former  spouse  dies.    If  a  child  resulting  from  the  marriage  of  the member  and  that  former  spouse  is  still  eligible,  the  cost  for  the  child  portion  of  the coverage is recomputed.  The recalculated cost for child only coverage becomes effective the  first  day  of  the  month  following  the  date  the  former  spouse  loses  eligibility.    To compute  child  costs,  multiply  the  base  amount  by  the  cost  factor  from  the  SBP  Child Only cost factor table (each SBP counselor will maintain a copy of the cost factor table) using  the  ages  of  the  member  and  the  youngest  eligible  child  on  their  birthdays  nearest the effective date of the election.  The child portion of the cost is suspended effective the first day of the month following the date the last remaining eligible child loses eligibility (reference paragraph 6.2.1). 12.1.2.  Reinstatement  of  Former  Spouse  and  Child  Premiums.    If  the  former  spouse portion  of  the  cost  was  suspended  as  a  result  of  the  former  spouse’s  remarriage  before age  55  and  that  marriage  terminates,  costs  for  former  spouse  coverage  are  reinstated effective  the  first  day  of  the  month  after  the  date  the  former  spouse’s  remarriage terminates.  If there is an eligible child (reference paragraph 6.2.1), the cost for the child portion of the coverage is recomputed at that time.  To compute the child cost, multiply the base amount by the cost factor from the SBP Spouse and Child cost factor table (each SBP  counselor  will  maintain  a  copy  of  the  cost  factor  table)  using  the  ages  of  the member,  former  spouse,  and  youngest  eligible  child  on  their  birthdays  nearest  the effective date of the election.  The recalculated cost for the child portion of the coverage becomes  effective  the  first  day  of  the  month  following  the  date  the  former  spouse becomes an eligible beneficiary. 13.  Premiums for Insurable Interest Coverage.  The premiums are computed as 10 percent of the member’s gross retired pay (reference paragraph 5.2 if the member received a CSB) plus an additional 5 percent for each full 5 years the beneficiary is younger than the member.  The total cost  may  not  exceed  40  percent  of  member’s  retired  pay.    See  Figure  4  below  for  a  sample insurable interest premium computation. Figure 4.  Sample Insurable Interest Premium Computation. Using a base amount of $1,000 Member age 45 and beneficiary age 32 Age difference is 13 years (which is two full 5-year periods).  Therefore, the cost percentage of this member’s retired pay is 20 percent.  Cost Computation:  30 AFI36-3006  7 OCTOBER 2009 Base amount Multiply by cost percentage Monthly cost $1,000   X  .20     $200 13.1.  Terminating Insurable Interest Premiums. 13.1.1.  A retiree with insurable interest coverage for a person who is not the member’s former spouse may  arbitrarily discontinue  coverage at  any time by submitting a  written request  to  DFAS-CL.   In this case, costs terminate the first  day of the  month following receipt  of  the  member’s  request  by  DFAS-CL  (reference  paragraph  6.6.8.2).    No premiums, properly collected, will be refunded as a result of terminating coverage under this provision. 13.1.2.  Premiums  for  insurable  interest  coverage  terminate  the  first  day  of  the  month after the date the insurable interest beneficiary dies.  The member must provide a copy of the death certificate to DFAS-CL. 13.2.  Premiums  for  Insurable  Interest  Elections  for  Former  Spouse  Coverage  Prior  to 1 March 1986.  As of 1 March 1986, a former spouse cannot  be  named  a beneficiary under the  insurable  interest  option.    Premiums  for  insurable  interest  elections  for  former  spouse coverage were computed as in paragraph 13, above. 14.  Paid-Up  Provision.  PL 105-261, Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal  Year  1999,  17 October 1998,  stipulates  that  effective  1 October 2008,  retired  members, who are age 70 or older, whose retired pay has been reduced for SBP premiums for 360 months (reference paragraph 14.1) will be considered ―paid-up.‖  No further premiums will be deducted from their retired pay, but an annuity remains payable to their covered beneficiary. 14.1.  Effect of Change in Level of Coverage.  If a retired member increased the level of SBP coverage during either the 1981-1982 or the 1992-1993 open enrollment  periods (reference paragraph  28),  only  that  portion  of  the  premium  shall  be  discontinued  that  pertains  to  the qualifying level of coverage.  For example, a member retired on 1 October 1978 and elected reduced SBP coverage for his/her spouse.  The member increased his/her level of coverage to full  on  1 October 1992  (during   As  of 1 October 2005, the member has paid approximately 156 monthly premiums for the full level of coverage (currently $130 a month [example premium  amount only]), and 324 months of premiums  relating  to  the  original  base  amount  (currently  $15  [example  premium  amount only]).    Only  $15  of  the  member’s  monthly  premium  will  be  discontinued  effective 1 October 2008, and the additional $115 ($130 minus $15) of premiums must continue to be deducted  for  another  168  premium  payments  following  that  date.    (Exception:    Members who  enrolled  or  increased  their  coverage  during  the  1999-2000  or  the  2005-2006  open enrollment  periods  will  be  given  credit  for  the  months  covered  by  their  lump-sum  buy-in payment.) the  1992-1993  open  enrollment  period). Section D—The Annuity 15.  General  Annuity Information.  The Defense Finance and Accounting Service - Cleveland Center (DFAS-CL, U.S. Military Annuitant Pay, PO Box 7131, London KY  40742-7131) is the point of contact to establish, suspend, reinstate, and terminate annuity payments.  Payment of an annuity  is  not  automatic.    A  properly  completed  DD  Form  2656-7,  Verification  For  Survivor AFI36-3006  7 OCTOBER 2009 31 Annuity has to be completed and submitted in accordance with instructions contained in AFI 36-3002, Casualty Services. 15.1.  An  annuity  is  payable  to  the  eligible  beneficiary(ies)  beginning  the  day  after  the member’s  death  unless  death  occurs  on  the  30th  day  of  a  31-day  month.    In  that  case,  the annuity starts on the first day of the next month. 15.2.  The  annuity  increases  at  the  same  rate  and  time  retired  pay  is  increased  by  COLAs; however, if the member received a CSB (reference paragraph 5.1), the annuity increase will be  equal  to  the  COLA  minus  one  percent  with  a  one-time  readjustment  when  the  deceased member  would  have  been  age  62.    After  the  increase  is  applied  to  the  annuity,  if  the increased annuity is not a multiple of $1, it will be rounded to the next lower multiple of $1.  The  annuity  terminates  on  the  last  day  of  the  month  before  the  month  in  which  the beneficiary  becomes  ineligible.    Example:    If  the  annuitant  dies  on  15 April,  the  annuity terminates 31 March. 15.3.  When two or more retirees name the same individual as an SBP spouse and/or former spouse  beneficiary,  the  annuitant  may  receive  only  one  annuity  at  a  time  and  must  choose which  annuity  to  receive.    An  eligible  child,  however,  may  receive  more  than  one  SBP annuity  if  named  as  a  beneficiary  by  more  than  one  military  member  (reference  paragraph 3.6.2.). 15.4.  An annuity will not  be paid  directly to  a  mentally incapacitated adult annuitant  or an annuitant determined to  be incompetent to manage their financial affairs.  The annuity may be  paid  to  a  third  party  on  behalf  of  the  incapacitated  annuitant  if  the  third  party  has  been appointed  as  guardian,  custodian,  or  other  fiduciary  pursuant  to  a  state  court.    The  annuity may also be paid to a representative payee, who is responsible for the care of the annuitant, as  determined  by  DFAS-CL.    A  representative  payee  will  not  be  established  solely  on  the basis of a written request from a third party that an annuitant is incapable of handling their own financial affairs.  DFAS-CL must receive a determination of incompetence made either by  a  state  court,  or  by  a  physician  or  psychologist  before  the  annuitant  will  be  considered unable to handle their financial affairs.  A representative payee is required to spend or invest the annuity solely for the benefit of the annuitant and must certify on a representative payee application  form  submitted  to  DFAS-CL  that  the  annuity  will  be  used  for  the  annuitant’s benefit. 15.5.  Annuity payments cannot be paid directly to a trust.  For income tax purposes, annuity payments must be made payable using the annuitant’s SSN. 16.  Spouse Annuity.  The annuity paid to a spouse is 55 percent of the base amount.  (Note:  If the  surviving  spouse  is  or  turns  age  62  prior  to  April 1, 2008,  the  annuity  may  be  subject  to  a temporary reduction [reference section E, below]). 16.1.  Suspension, Reinstatement, or Termination of Spouse Annuity. 16.1.1.  Suspension.    Effective  14 November 1986,  a  surviving  spouse’s  annuity  is suspended if he/she remarries before age 55.  The annuity is suspended the last day of the month  before  the  month  of  remarriage.    Prior  to  14 November 1986,  the  annuity  was suspended if remarriage occurred before age 60. 32 AFI36-3006  7 OCTOBER 2009 16.1.2.  Reinstatement.    An  annuity  suspended  because  of  the  surviving  spouse’s remarriage  prior  to  age  55  may  be  reinstated  if  the  remarriage  terminates.    The  annuity begins the first day of the month in which the remarriage terminates. 16.1.3.  Termination Due to Death of Spouse Annuitant.  The annuity terminates effective the last day of the month before the month in which the annuitant dies.  The NOK should notify DFAS-CL at their toll-free number (1-800-321-1080) to avoid an overpayment. 16.2.  DIC Offset.  If the surviving spouse is awarded DIC by the VA based on the service-connected death of the same member who provided the SBP coverage, DFAS-CL reduces the spouse’s SBP annuity by the amount of the DIC award.  The SBP annuity is not reduced if the spouse’s DIC is derived from the service of another member (U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, 87-1037, Gertrude M. Croteau vs United States). 16.2.1.  For  offset  purposes,  the  DIC  award  includes  any  additional  amount  paid  to  the spouse by the VA because of the veteran’s total disability rating for a continuous period of at  least  8  years preceding death.   To be eligible, the spouse had to  be  married to  the member  for  those  same  8  years.    It  does  not  include  any  amount  attributable  to  child entitlement  or  additional  VA  payments  to  the  spouse  for  aid  and  attendance  or housebound. 16.2.2.  DIC payments normally begin on the first day of the month following the month of the member’s death (reference paragraph 16.2.5).  The SBP annuity is reduced by DIC on  the  date  DIC  payments  begin.    The  DIC  offset  to  the  SBP  increases  each  time  DIC rates increase. 16.2.2.1.  If  the  DIC  award  is  greater  than  the  SBP  annuity,  no  SBP  annuity  is  paid and  the  SBP  premiums  for  spouse  coverage  paid  by  a  retiree  are  refunded  to  the surviving spouse.  The spouse must apply for the SBP annuity in order to receive the SBP premium refund. 16.2.2.2.  If  the  DIC  award  is  less  than  the  SBP  annuity,  the  spouse  is  paid  an  SBP annuity  equal  to  the  difference  between  the  full  annuity  and  the  DIC.    A  refund  of SBP  premiums  is  made  based  on  the  difference  between  the  costs  actually  incurred and the costs that would have been incurred in order to provide the annuity payable after the DIC reduction. 16.2.3.  The cost refund does not include premium additions attributable to the 1992-1993 open enrollment; any lump sum buy-in premiums attributable to the 1999-2000 or 2005-2006 open enrollments; or any interest charges due to delinquent costs. 16.2.4.  A spouse whose DIC award is suspended because of remarriage prior to age 57 may  have  the  full  SBP  annuity  reinstated  if  the  remarriage  occurs  after  age  55.    The spouse must repay any SBP premiums refunded at the time DIC was awarded.  The SBP annuity is reinstated effective the date the DIC is suspended.  The spouse may repay the premiums in a lump sum or monthly installments.  If the surviving spouse elects to make repayment  in  installments,  DFAS-CL  will  deduct  installment  payments  from  the  SBP annuity payable.  The deductions will be in the amount of 50 percent of the DIC amount or  50  percent  of  the  gross  annuity,  whichever  is  less.    No  interest  will  accrue  until  the date  of  the  first  readjusted  annuity  payment.    Thereafter,  interest  accumulates  on  any unpaid balance until the full amount has been repaid.  If the marriage later terminates and AFI36-3006  7 OCTOBER 2009 33 the spouse again becomes eligible for DIC, the SBP annuity will again be reduced by the amount of the DIC, but no second refund of SBP premiums will be paid. 16.2.5.  When a claim for DIC is not filed within one year after the member’s death, the effective date of the DIC award is the date of receipt of the DIC claim by the VA.  In this case, the surviving spouse receives the full amount of the SBP annuity until the effective date of the DIC award and no SBP premiums will be refunded. 16.3.  Certificate of  Eligibility (COE).  Once the  annuity is  established, DFAS-CL mails an annual  COE  to  the  annuitant  that  must  be  completed  and  returned  in  order  to  certify continued eligibility.  Prompt return of the statement will ensure there will be no interruption in the annuity payments. 17.  Child Annuity.  The annuity payable is 55 percent of the base amount and is paid in equal shares to eligible children beginning the day after the member’s death (reference paragraph 6.2.1 for  definition  of  an  eligible  child).    See  Figure  5.,  below,  for  an  example  of  annuity  paid  to several children. Figure 5.  Example of Annuity Paid to Several Children. 4 $1,100 $275 each eligible child  Number of children Annuity amount Annuity divided by number of children ($1,100  4) =  As one of the children loses eligibility because of age, marriage, or because he/she is over 18 and no longer a full-time student, the remaining 3 children share the annuity.  The annuity amount per child will then be as follows: Number of children Annuity divided by number of children ($1,100  3) =  All annuity payments terminate when the last child loses eligibility  A child may receive more than one SBP annuity if named as the beneficiary by more than one military member (reference paragraph 3.6). Marriage at any age terminates a child’s eligibility for the annuity.  An annulment of a child's marriage which renders the marriage void and invalid, or a judicial decree by a court of competent jurisdiction declaring the marriage void, would serve as a basis for reinstating a child's eligibility for the annuity prospectively from the date of the judicial decree.  Termination of a child's marriage by death or divorce does not restore annuity eligibility. A child’s SBP annuity is not reduced by the child’s DIC entitlement, if applicable. 3 $366 each eligible child   17.1.  Suspension, Reinstatement, or Termination of Child(ren) Annuity. 17.1.1.  Suspension of Annuity.  A child’s annuity is suspended if the child marries, if the child between the ages of 18 or 22 is not enrolled as a full-time student, or if a disabled child over 18 becomes capable of self-support (reference paragraph 6.2.1). 34 AFI36-3006  7 OCTOBER 2009 17.1.2.  Reinstatement of Annuity.  A suspended annuity may be reinstated when a child between  the  ages  of  18  and  22  reenters  school  on  a  full-time  basis,  the  recurrence  of  a disability incurred before the child’s 18th birthday (or before the 22nd birthday if disability incurred  while  a  full-time  student)  which  again  renders  the  child  incapable  of  self-support,  or  the  child’s  marriage  is  properly  annulled.    DFAS-CL  must  be  provided appropriate documentation before the annuity can be reinstated (reference attachment 8).  Divorce  or  death  of  the  child’s  spouse  does  not  reinstate  a  previously  married  child’s eligibility for the annuity. 17.1.3.  Termination of Annuity.  The annuity terminates the last day of the month before the month the last remaining child’s eligibility ends. 17.2.  Annuity  Payments  for  Minor  Child.   An  SBP  annuity  may  not    be  paid  directly    to  a minor.  Annuity payments for a minor child are paid to the legal guardian; or, if there is no legal guardian, to the natural parent, who has care, custody, and control of the child; or to a representative  payee  of  the  child  as  determined  by  DFAS-CL  (reference  paragraph  15.4).  The annuity can be paid directly to an eligible child only when the child is considered to be of majority age under the laws in the state of residence.  The child is then considered an adult for annuity purposes and a custodian or legal fiduciary is no longer required unless the child is incapacitated (reference paragraph 17.3, below). 17.3.  Annuity Payments to a Mentally Incapacitated Adult Child or Adult Child Determined by Medical Authority to be Incapable of Managing Own Financial Affairs.  In this case, the annuity may  be paid to a legal guardian; or if there is no legal guardian, to the natural parent who has care, custody, and control of the child;  or to a representative payee of the child as determined by DFAS-CL (reference paragraph 15.4). 17.4.  Verification  of  Continued  Eligibility  of  Child(ren).    DFAS-CL  requires  students between  the  age  of  18  and  22  to  complete  a  DD  Form  2788,  Child  Annuitant’s  School Certification, to provide certification of intent to continue full-time study or training for each school semester or other period in which the school year is divided.  A separate certificate is required for each term/semester in which the school year is divided.  Payments to a student continue during any interval between school semesters that does not exceed 150 days if the student demonstrates, to the satisfaction of DFAS-CL, that he or she has a bona fide intention of  continuing  a  full-time  course  of  study  or  training  at  a  recognized  educational  institution (reference paragraph 6.2.2) immediately after that interval. 17.4.1.  An  otherwise  eligible  child,  properly  enrolled  in  a  full-time  course  of  study  or training at a recognized educational institution, who becomes ill or requires non-elective surgery during a school term, retains his/her student status for the rest of that school term. 17.4.2.  DFAS-CL  confirms  eligibility  of  a  disabled  child  every  2  years.    If  medical documentation shows that the disability is permanent, further documentation may not be required. 18.  Spouse and Child Annuity.  Only one annuity is payable.  It is paid first to the spouse, who is  the  primary  beneficiary.    If  the  spouse  loses  eligibility  due  to  remarriage  prior  to  age  55  or death, the annuity is paid in equal shares to any eligible child(ren).  When the last eligible child loses  eligibility,  SBP  payments  stop.    The  annuity  can  be  reinstated  for  the  spouse  if  the remarriage ends.  Reference paragraph 16 for the annuity amount paid to a spouse and paragraph AFI36-3006  7 OCTOBER 2009 35 17 for annuity amounts paid to an eligible child(ren). When an election is for spouse and child coverage  and  a  DIC  refund  is  made  under  paragraph  16.2,  the  refund  to  the  spouse  does  not include  any  additional  amounts  the  member  paid  for  child  coverage.    If  the  spouse  remarries before  age  55  or  dies,  the  full  SBP  annuity  is  paid  in  equal  shares  to  any  eligible  child(ren) (reference paragraph 6.2.1). 18.1.  Suspension, Reinstatement, or Termination of a Spouse and Child Annuity.  Reference paragraph 16.1 for information on suspending, reinstating or terminating a spouse’s annuity.  Reference paragraph 17.1 for information on suspending, reinstating, or terminating a child’s annuity. 19.  Former  Spouse  Annuity.  The  same  rules  that  apply  to  a  spouse  annuity  also  apply  to  a former spouse annuity (reference paragraph 16). 19.1.  Suspension,  Reinstatement,  or  Termination  of  a  Former  Spouse  Annuity.    The  same rules  that  apply  to  the  suspension,  reinstatement,  or  termination  of  a  spouse  annuity  also apply to a former spouse annuity (reference paragraph 16.1) unless  the member dies during the  period  the  former  spouse  coverage  and  premiums  are  suspended  because  of  the  former spouse’s remarriage prior to  age 55, the former spouse regains  eligibility  for the annuity in the event the remarriage subsequently terminates. 20.  Former  Spouse  and  Child  Annuity.  Only  one  annuity  is  payable.    It  is  payable  to  the eligible former spouse, who is the primary beneficiary.  If the former spouse becomes ineligible, it  is  paid  in  equal  shares  to  any  eligible  child(ren).    Only  eligible  children  resulting  from  the marriage of the member and that former spouse are eligible to  receive  the annuity.  Reference paragraph 19 for the annuity amount payable to the former spouse.  Reference paragraph 17 for the annuity amount payable to eligible child(ren). 20.1.  Suspension, Reinstatement, or Termination of a Former Spouse and Child Annuity.  A former  spouse  and  child  annuity  is  suspended,  reinstated,  or  terminated  under  the  same conditions as a spouse and child annuity (reference paragraph 18.1). 21.  Insurable  Interest  Annuity.  The  annuity  is  55  percent  of  the  member’s  retired  pay remaining  after  the  monthly  cost  has  been  deducted.    See  Figure  6.,  below,  for  a  sample insurable interest annuity computation.  Payment of the annuity is not affected by the annuitant’s marriage, age, or student status.  Payments are increased by COLAs at the same time and by the same percentage as retired pay is increased. Figure 6.  Sample Insurable Interest Annuity Computation. Base amount Minus monthly cost (10 to 40% - reference paragraph 13)  Multiply remainder by 55% Monthly annuity $1,000  - $200     $800   X  .55     $440 21.1.  Termination  of  Insurable  Interest  Annuity.    The  annuity  terminates  effective  the  last day of the month before the month in which the annuitant dies.  DFAS-CL should be notified at their toll-free number (1-800-321-1080) to avoid an overpayment. 36 AFI36-3006  7 OCTOBER 2009 Section E—Provisions Which May Be Applicable to the Annuity of a Spouse or Former Spouse Age 62 or Older Prior to 1 April 2008. 22.  Spouse  or  Former  Spouse  Annuity  Reduction  at  Age  62.  Until passage of PL 108-375, dated 28 October 2004, the annuity payable to a surviving spouse or former spouse who was age 62 or older was reduced from 55 percent to 35 percent of the base amount.  The spouse or former spouse  of  any  member  who  was  already  retired  or  retirement  eligible  prior  to  2 October 1985, was  grandfathered  under  an  older  Social  Security  Offset  reduction  method  (55%  of  the  base amount minus the Social Security entitlement based upon the member's military service time) if that provided a larger annuity.  (Exception:  The annuity for a former spouse of a retiree who was retired  or  eligible  to  retire  prior  to  2 October 1985  and  whose  divorce  from  the  member  was finalized before 30 November 1989 was not subject to reduction when the former spouse attained age 62.) PL 108-375 authorized the elimination of the age 62 reduction to a surviving spouse’s or former spouse’s SBP annuity according to the following annuity increase schedule: Table 4.  Phased Annuity Increase Schedule. Annuity paid: Annuity computed Any month prior to Oct 2005 Oct 2005 through Mar 2006 Apr 2006 through Mar 2007 Apr 2007 through Mar 2008 Apr 2008 35% of the base amount (unless grandfathered and the Social Security Offset reduction method provides a larger annuity - see Note) 40% of the base amount (unless grandfathered and the Social Security Offset reduction method provides a larger annuity - see Note) 45% of the base amount (unless grandfathered and the Social Security Offset reduction method provides a larger annuity - see Note) 50% of the base amount (unless grandfathered and the Social Security Offset reduction method provides a larger annuity - see Note) all Spouse annuities will be 55% without regard to the annuitant's age. Note:  The spouse or former spouse of any member who was already retired or retirement eligible on or before 1 October 1985, was grandfathered under the older Social Security Offset reduction method (55% of the base amount minus Social Security entitlement based upon the member's military service time) if that provided a larger annuity. 22.1.  Initial Annuities Computed.  Effective 1 October 2005 and ending on 31 March 2008, for an annuitant who is age 62 or older upon initial commencement of the SBP annuity, the annuity was computed using the above Phased Annuity Increase Schedule percentage.  The annuity  was  subsequently  recomputed  each  annuity  increase  period.    All  annuities commencing on or after 1 April 2008 are computed at 55 percent of the base amount selected by the member. AFI36-3006  7 OCTOBER 2009 37 22.2.  Existing  Annuities  Recomputed.    A  surviving  spouse  who,  on  1 October 2005,  was receiving  an  SBP  annuity,  had  their  annuity  recomputed  on  1 October 2005  so  that  the annuity reflected the percentage amount in the above Phased Annuity Increase Schedule.  A recomputation  occurred  each  of  the  above  periods.    To  compute  the  increased  annuity,  the annuity amount being paid on 30 September 2005 was used to determine an ―implied‖ base amount at death.  The implied base amount was divided by the percentage of the base amount being  paid  on  that  date.    The  product  became  the  ―implied‖  base  amount  at  death.    The implied base amount was multiplied by the appropriate percent in the above Phased Annuity Increase Schedule each increase period.  Applicable COLAs for each year were then added to determine  the  new  annuity  amount  each  increase  period.    However,  if  the  annuitant  was grandfathered  under  the  older  Social  Security  Offset  reduction  method  (reference  NOTE, above) and that provided a larger annuity, the annuitant received that annuity amount during that  annuity  increase  period.    This  comparison  was  done  each  period  until  the  annuity payable was larger using the above Phased Annuity Increase Schedule percentage. 23.  Supplemental  SBP  (SSBP).  PL  101-189,  29 November l989,  established  the  SSBP effective 1 April 1992.  An election for SSBP allowed a member to supplement the standard 35 percent SBP annuity that was payable to an otherwise eligible spouse or former spouse who was age  62  or  older.    SSBP  was  payable  in  an  amount  equal  to  5,  10,  15,  or  20  percent  of  the member’s gross retired pay, depending on the percentage of SSBP the member elected (5, 10, 15, or 20 percent).  SSBP paid a spouse or former spouse who was age 62 or older an extra benefit of 5, 10, 15, or 20 percent  in  addition  to the 35 percent  normally paid.   If full SSBP (20 percent) was elected, the annuity would remain at 55 percent after the spouse or former spouse turned age 62.    Any  member  who  elected  SSBP  coverage  waived  the  right  to  have  the  SBP  annuity computed under the Social Security Offset method (reference NOTE, above).  Effective 1 April 1992 retiring members who elected SBP coverage for a spouse or former spouse at the maximum level could simultaneously elect SSBP coverage.  An election to provide SSBP coverage was not valid if the base amount for spouse or former spouse SBP coverage was less than full retired pay.  PL  101-189,  29 November 1989,  also  authorized  a  one-year  open  enrollment  period (1 April 1992 – 31 March 1993) for members who were already retired.  Members with full SBP coverage or members who increased their SBP to  full during the open enrollment period could elect SSBP coverage. 23.1.  SSBP Premiums  The SSBP was designed to operate on an actuarially-neutral basis so the SSBP was not Government subsidized.  SSBP premiums were based upon the member’s age and were in addition to premiums paid for standard SBP coverage.   The phased age-62 annuity  increase  (reference  table  22-1)  authorized  by  PL  108-375,  28 October 2004 prohibited  any  new  election  for    SSBP  coverage  effective  1 November 2004.    For  those retired members who were paying for SSBP coverage, the reduction in their retired pay for SSBP premiums was terminated effective 1 November 2004. 23.2.  SSBP Annuity Payable. 23.2.1.  Members who retired prior to 28 October 2004, who elected some level of SSBP continued  to  have  that  coverage  through  the  age  62  phased  annuity  increase  schedule (reference Figure 22-1) but without further payment of SSBP premiums.  The annuity for a spouse or former spouse who was covered by SSBP, was increased by the appropriate amount of SSBP coverage.  However, the annuity could not be greater than 55 percent of the base amount.  (Example:  If the member elected 5 percent SSBP, the 1 October 2005 38 AFI36-3006  7 OCTOBER 2009 annuity  recomputation  was  at  45  percent  and  not  40 percent;  the  1 April 2006 recomputation was at 50 percent and not 45 percent; the 1 April 2007 recomputation was at 55 percent and not 50 percent; thereafter it remained at 55 percent as the annuity could not  be  larger  than  55  percent  of  the  base  amount).    Spouse’s  or  former  spouse’s  of members  who  retired  prior  to  28 October 2004  who  did  not  elect  SSBP  were  subject  to the age 62 reduction and phased annuity increase schedule (reference table 22-1). 23.2.2.  Members who retired after 28 October 2004, who elected FULL spouse or former spouse SBP coverage had free full SSBP coverage (called ―presumed coverage‖) during the  period  28 October 2004  to  1 April 2008  UNLESS  they  retired  for  disability.    If  the member  retired  for  disability,  full  SSBP  coverage  only  applied  if  the  member  lived  for one  year  following  disability  retirement  or,  if  they  died  within  the  first  year  following disability retirement, the cause of death was not related to a medical condition for which they  were  medically  retired.    Members  who  retire  after  28 October 2004,  who  elected reduced  spouse  or  former  spouse  SBP  coverage  could  not  be  considered  to  have  SSBP and their beneficiary is subject to the age 62 reduction and phased annuity increases. 23.2.3.  SSBP  was  not  applicable  to  active  duty  deaths,  so  the  phased  annuity  increase schedule  (above)  was  applicable  if  the  spouse  or  former  spouse  was  or  turned  age  62 prior to 1 April 2008. 23.2.4.  The  following  chart  shows,  by  group,  the  presumed  SSBP  coverage  during  the period 28 October 2004 to 1 April 2008: Table 5.  Presumed SSBP Coverage.       Category ·      Currently Retired with SSBP  ·      Currently Retired without SSBP ·      Retired after 28 Oct 04 with full Spouse or Former Spouse SBP ·      Retired after 28 Oct 04 with reduced Spouse or Former Spouse SBP ·       Presumed SSBP  ·       Yes ·       No ·       Yes ·       No ·      Disability retired after 28 Oct 04 with full Spouse or Former Spouse SBP and die within  ·       No   one year of cause for which retired ·      Disability retired after 28 Oct 04 with full Spouse or Former Spouse SBP and live one ·       Yes   year or if death is within one year cause of death is not related to medical reason for   which retired ·      Member dies on active duty ·       No Section F—Miscellaneous Provisions 24.  Taxes. 24.1.  Federal Income Tax. AFI36-3006  7 OCTOBER 2009 39 24.1.1.    Taxability  of  Premiums.    Members  do  not  pay  Federal  income  tax  on  monthly premiums deducted from retired pay for SBP coverage.  A member whose pay is subject to tax withholding will, while in a pay status, receive the tax savings through a reduction in  the amount of taxable income that is  reported  to  the  Internal  Revenue  Service (IRS).  The  taxability  of  the  member’s  retired  pay  has  no  bearing  on  the  taxability  of  annuity payments to the survivor or cost refund to the surviving spouse. 24.1.2.  Taxability of Annuity.    The SBP  annuity is subject to Federal income tax when paid  to  the  beneficiary.    A  refund  of  premiums  resulting  from  an  administrative  error, correction  of  record,  or  the  awarding  of  DIC  is  taxable  to  the  annuitant.    DFAS-CL withholds  Federal  income  tax  from  the  annuity  using  married  status  with  three exemptions unless the beneficiary contacts DFAS-CL with the desired marital status and number of exemptions.  A beneficiary has the right to elect no withholding.  At the end of the  year,  DFAS-CL  provides  the  beneficiary  an  income  tax  form  to  show  gross  SBP  income and the amount of Federal tax withheld. 24.2.  Non-Resident Alien Beneficiary.  Non-resident alien SBP beneficiaries living in foreign countries are subject  to  a withholding  tax by the US  government on their monthly  annuity.  The withholding tax rate is 30 percent of the payable annuity.  The tax levy is not part of the SBP  laws,  but  results  from  individual  tax  treaties  between  the  US  government  and  various foreign  countries.    The  30  percent  is  a  fixed  tax  that  must  be  withheld  by  DFAS-CL.  However, there may be tax treaties with individual countries exempting the annuity from this tax  or  specifying  a  withholding  rate  other  than  30  percent.    An  IRS  Form  W-8BEN, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficiary Owner for United States Tax Withholding, can be used to request the SBP annuity be tax exempt or to specify a withholding rate other than 30 percent  based  on  a  tax  treaty.    If  non-resident  alien  beneficiaries  desire  more  information concerning  this  matter,  they  should  contact  the  IRS,  DFAS-CL,  or  the  nearest  American Embassy. 24.3.  Federal Estate Tax.  The value of the SBP annuity at the time of the member’s death may  be  subject  to  Federal  estate  tax.    Beneficiaries  should  address  tax  questions  to  a  legal assistance officer or their nearest IRS office. 24.4.  State Taxes.  Whether SBP annuities are subject to state inheritance or income tax and the  method  of  calculating  such  tax  depend  upon  the  laws  of  the  state  concerned.    Current statutes, however, do not allow DFAS-CL to withhold state income taxes from an annuity. 25.  Options for Future Civil Service Retirement. 25.1.  A  retiree  who  is  an  SBP  participant  and  who  subsequently  retires  from  Civil  Service and  waives  military  retired  pay  to  combine  civilian  and  military  service  credits  may  not participate in both the military SBP and the Civil Service survivor annuity program.  Such a member may: 25.1.1.  Decline  the  Civil  Service  survivor  coverage  and  continue  in  SBP,  sending  SBP premiums directly to DFAS-CL, or 25.1.2.  Participate in the Civil Service survivor program at any level and  SBP coverage will be suspended.  If the waiver of military retired pay is terminated for any reason, SBP coverage resumes when the member again begins to receive retired pay. 40 AFI36-3006  7 OCTOBER 2009 25.2.  An  SBP  participant  who  does  not  waive  military  retired  pay  upon  retirement  from Civil Service must continue SBP participation.  The member may also elect coverage under the Civil Service annuity plan and a survivor may receive annuities from both plans. 26.  Withdrawal  Provision  For  Totally  VA  Disabled  Members.  PL 96-402, 9 October 1980, permits a member who is  rated totally disabled by  the VA from a service-connected cause and who has been so rated continuously for 10 years, or a lesser period of at least 5 years from the date  of  last  discharge  or  release  from  active  duty,  to  withdraw  from  SBP.    The  initial  date  for determining the 5- or 10-year period is the effective date of the VA rating of total disability.  The eligible survivor(s) of a member, who meets the criteria for withdrawal, may be entitled to DIC upon  the  member’s  death  even  if  the  member  dies  of  a  nonservice-connected  cause.    The member should contact  the VA to  verify the survivor’s entitlement to  DIC before submitting a withdrawal request.  A member whose rating is later reduced to less than total (therefore, DIC to member’s  survivors  will  not  be  assured),  may  apply  to  have  the  SBP  reinstated.    Survivors  of members  who  die  while  participation  is  withdrawn  under  this  provision  are  barred  from receiving an SBP annuity. 26.1.  The retiree should send a withdrawal request to DFAS-CL with a statement authorizing DFAS-CL  to  verify  the  length  of  the  member’s  total  disability  rating  with  the  VA  and  the beneficiary’s written and notarized consent to the withdrawal.  Should the beneficiary(ies) be a  dependent  child  or  children,  written  consent  may  be  accepted  from  the  other  parent,  a stepparent,  foster  parent,  guardian,  or  an  individual  appointed  by  a  court  of  competent jurisdiction. 26.2.  DFAS-CL  provides  the  member  a  statement  of  the  advantages  of  participating  in  the SBP and the possible disadvantages of discontinuing participation. 26.2.1.  Possible Advantages of Continuing Participation: 26.2.1.1.  If  the  SBP  annuity  is  greater  than  the  DIC  entitlement,  the  spouse  is  paid SBP  in  an  amount  equal  to  the  difference  between  the  SBP  and  the  DIC.    SBP premiums  attributable  to  the  amount  of  SBP  not  received  are  refunded  (reference paragraph 16.2.2.2 and 16.2.3). 26.2.1.2.  Although  a  spouse’s  DIC  entitlement  is  suspended  for  remarriage  prior  to age  57,  a  spouse  may  retain  the  SBP  annuity  if  the  spouse  is  age  55  or  older  at  the time  of  remarriage.    This  would  result  in  the  full  SBP  annuity  being  reinstated (having  previously  been  offset  by  the  DIC)  after  the  annuitant  repays  the  SBP  cost refund. 26.2.1.3.  In the event  a  spouse (whose SBP annuity is  being offset  by DIC) dies or remarries  before  age  55,  the  full  SBP  annuity  becomes  payable  to  any  eligible child(ren) if the SBP election is for spouse and child coverage. 26.2.1.4.  If  the  SBP  election  is  for  child  only  coverage,  the  child(ren)  will  be  paid both DIC and the full SBP annuity.  This is an important consideration when a child is permanently disabled. 26.2.2.  Possible Disadvantage of Withdrawing.  If member’s disability rating is reduced to less than total and he or she fails to reinstate SBP coverage, the survivors receive no benefits from SBP and possibly no benefits from DIC. AFI36-3006  7 OCTOBER 2009 41 26.2.3.  A member may withdraw a request for discontinued participation within 30 days after the request is received by DFAS-CL. 26.3.  The  withdrawal  request  will  not  take  effect  until  the  member  confirms  receipt  of  the information, acknowledges that he/she still wishes to withdraw, and the member’s disability rating is verified.  DFAS-CL will terminate all coverage effective the first day of the month following the month the valid request was received by DFAS-CL.  The member is refunded any  costs  paid  after  the  effective  date  of  withdrawal.    Costs  deducted  or  paid  before  the effective date of withdrawal are refunded to the surviving spouse upon the member’s death (reference  paragraph  26.5,  below).    If  the  spouse  does  not  survive  the  retiree,  no  refund  is authorized. 26.4.  If a member dies after the date a request for withdrawal has been received by DFAS-CL, but before the effective date of that request, the beneficiary is entitled to the annuity. 26.5.  Upon the death of a member who has discontinued participation under this provision, a refund of SBP premiums, without interest, shall be paid to the widow or widower. 26.6.  A  member  whose  disability  rating  is  reduced  to  less  than  total  may  again  elect  to participate in SBP by making application within 1 year of the effective date of the lowered disability  rating.    Resumption  of  participation  is  limited  to  the  previous  type  and  level  of coverage  elected,  allowing  only  authorized  changes.    To  be  valid,  the  application  must include  documentation  that  the  VA  has  reduced  the  member’s  service-connected  disability rating.  If the member, who applies for resumption of participation, dies before the effective date,  the  beneficiary  is  entitled  to  an  annuity  on  the  date  the  election  would  have  been effective. 27.  Payment of Annuity When Retiree Is Missing and Presumed Dead.  An SBP beneficiary may apply for the annuity if the participating member’s retired pay has been suspended because the member is missing and presumed dead.  For the purpose of initiating SBP payments, the SAF is authorized to determine if a member is presumed dead.  The member may be presumed dead if missing for at least 30 days under circumstances that would cause a reasonably prudent person to believe the member is dead. 27.1.  The  DFAS-CL  calculates  the  SBP  annuity  in  accordance  with  the  base  amount previously  elected  by  the  missing  retiree  as  if  the  member  died  on  the  date  the  retired  pay was  suspended  or  would  have  been  suspended  if  no  retired  pay  is  payable  (e.g.,  full  VA waiver). 27.2.  SBP annuity payments stop if the member is later found to be alive.  All past payments constitute a debt to the US, which will be collected or offset from any retired pay otherwise payable  or  from  any  other  payment  from  the  US  to  which  the  member  is  entitled.    If  the member  should  die  before  liquidating  the  debt,  the  balance  may  be  collected  from  the beneficiary  if  that  beneficiary  had  received  the  annuity  during  the  period  the  member  was presumed dead. 28.  Open  Enrollment  Periods.  An  open  enrollment  period requires  Congressional authorization.  During an open enrollment  period, changes in  coverage  which are not  normally authorized may be allowed.  Each open enrollment period carries separate guidelines. 42 AFI36-3006  7 OCTOBER 2009 the  SBP.   The  open  enrollment  period,  originally  scheduled 28.1.  PL  92-425,  21 September 1972,  repealed  the  RSFPP  (reference  paragraph  31)  and established from 21 September 1972  –  20 September 1973  was  later  extended  to  20 March 1974  by  PL  93-155,  16 November 1973.    A  member  with  RSFPP  coverage  could  keep  RSFPP  and  also participate in the SBP or cancel the RSFPP and participate in the SBP.  A spouse, married to the  retiree  at  the  time  of  retirement,  was  automatically  covered  on  the  effective  date  of  the election. 28.2.  PL 97-35, 13 August 1981, authorized an open enrollment period from 1 October 1981 –  30 September 1982  for  members  who  were  entitled  to  retired  pay  on  or  before 13 August 1981.    Members  could  enroll  or  increase  their  coverage  if  they  previously  had reduced coverage.  Members who submitted an open enrollment election had to live for two years before the election was valid. 28.3.  PL  101-189,  29 November 1989,  originally  authorized  a  one-year  open  enrollment period to begin 1 October 1991; however the beginning date was delayed until 1 April 1992 by  PL  101-510,  5 November 1990.    Members  could  enroll,  increase  their  coverage,  and/or elect  SSBP  if    they  had  or  increased  their  SBP  coverage  to  maximum  spouse  or  former spouse coverage.  Members who submitted an open enrollment election had to  live for two years before the election was valid.  Members were required to pay a premium addition (up to  4.5  percent)  based  on  the  number  of  years  that  elapsed  since  the  member’s  date  of retirement. from 28.4.  PL  105-261,  17 October 1998,  authorized  an  open  enrollment  period 1 March 1999 – 29 February 2000.  Members who submitted an open enrollment election had to live for two years before the election was valid.  A one-time buy-in premium was required in addition to the monthly premiums.  The amount was determined by the date the retiree was first eligible to enroll. 28.5.

Retired  Serviceman’s  Family  Protection  Plan  (RSFPP)  (reference  paragraph  31, below)  or  SBP  annuity  based  on  the  military  service  of  this  or  any  other  deceased member. 44 AFI36-3006  7 OCTOBER 2009 30.4.3.  DIC from the VA. 31.  Retired  Serviceman’s  Family  Protection  Plan  (RSFPP).  The  RSFPP  was  the  DoD survivor  program  in  effect  prior  to  21 September l972  when  it  was  replaced  by  the  SBP.    This section provides MPFs the information needed to respond to retiree and survivor inquiries about the RSFPP. 31.1.  Election Options. Option 1 - Spouse only Option 2 - Child only. Option 3 - Spouse and child.  A member who elected option 3 could  elect  a single annuity (paid to the spouse until death or remarriage and thereafter to eligible dependent children in equal shares) or 2 separate annuities (a combination of option 1 for spouse and option 2 for child). Option 4 - Option (which carried an additional cost) that permitted an RSFPP participant to terminate, withdraw, or reduce participation.  A member who retired before 13 August l968 had  to  select  option  4  in  order  to  terminate,  withdraw,  or  reduce  coverage.    Each  member who retired on or after 13 August 1968 automatically had option 4. 31.2.  Features of RSFPP. 31.2.1.  The member had to elect RSFPP coverage prior to completing 18 years of service for pay purposes.  If enrollment occurred after the 18th year of service, a member had to serve  an  additional  3  years  on  active  duty  for  the  election  to  be  valid  upon  retirement (changed  to  19th  year  of  service  and  2  additional  years  on  active  duty  effective 1 November 1968).    The  member  could  elect  coverage  based  on  a  percent  of  expected retired pay (one-half, one-fourth, or one-eighth); however, the annuity could not be less than $25 a month.  The cost was based on the member’s expected age at retirement and the relative age of the spouse (years spouse was younger or older than the member).  The age of the youngest child was also factored in to compute spouse and child costs. 31.2.2.  Neither  RSFPP  premiums  nor  the  annuity  paid  to  the  beneficiary  are  subject  to COLAs (reference paragraph 31.8 for exception); therefore, both remain at the same level as originally established on the date of the member’s retirement. 31.2.3.  RSFPP  premiums  deducted  from  a  member’s  retired  pay  are  not  subject  to Federal income tax.  The annuity, however, is subject to Federal income tax. 31.2.4.  Only the spouse married to the member and the dependent children the member had  on  the  date  of  retirement  could  be  covered.    A  spouse  or  child  acquired  after retirement may not be covered by the RSFPP. 31.2.5.  There are no provisions under the RSFPP for former spouse coverage. 31.3.  Payment  of  Annuity.    An  annuity  is  payable  to  the  eligible  beneficiary  beginning  the first  day of the month in  which the member’s death  occurs.  The  annuity terminates on the last day of the month prior to the month in which the beneficiary loses eligibility. 31.4.  Period of Eligibility. AFI36-3006  7 OCTOBER 2009 45 31.4.1.  Spouse.    A  covered  spouse  is  an  eligible  RSFPP  annuitant  for  life  or  until remarriage before age 60.  An annuity terminated due to  remarriage before age 60 may not  be  reinstated.    (Exception:    If  the  marriage  is  not  ended  by  divorce  or  death  of  the spouse,  but  rather  by  an  annulment  or  judicial  decree  that  voids  the  marriage,  the widow’s coverage may be reinstated when DFAS-CL is provided a certified copy of the annulment decree or court order declaring the marriage void.)  An RSFPP annuity is not terminated if the spouse remarries after age 60. 31.4.2.  Child(ren).    Unmarried  children  are  eligible  beneficiaries  until  age  18  if  the member  retired  before  1 November l968.   If  the  member  retired  on  or  after 1 November l968, unmarried children are eligible beneficiaries until age 18, or age 23 if attending school  full time.  Unmarried mentally  or physically incapacitated children are eligible  beneficiaries  for  life  if  the  disabling  condition  rendered  them  incapable  of  self-support and the incapacitating condition existed before the child reached age 18. 31.5.  Terminate, Withdraw, or Reduce RSFPP Coverage:  Only members with option 4 are allowed to terminate, withdraw, or reduce RSFPP coverage. 31.5.1.  Terminate  Coverage  (When  No  Eligible  Beneficiary).    It  is  the  member’s responsibility  to  send  a  termination  request  to  DFAS-CL,  (DFAS-CL,  US  Military Retirement  Pay,  PO  Box  7130,  London  KY   40742-7130)  with  substantiating documentation  (e.g.,  copy  divorce  decree  or  death  certificate).    There  is  no  refund  of premiums properly collected. 31.5.1.1.  Spouse  premiums  and  coverage  are  terminated  upon  loss  of  the  spouse beneficiary through death or divorce. 31.5.1.2.  Child only premiums and coverage are terminated when the last remaining dependent child becomes ineligible due to age, marriage, or death. 31.5.1.3.  Spouse and Child (Single Option) premiums and coverage continue as long as  there  is  an  eligible  spouse  or  child  beneficiary  if  the  member  retired  before 1 November 1968.  If the member retired after 31 October 1968, all costs cease on the loss of the spouse, and the eligible child(ren) continue to be covered until no longer eligible at no cost to the member. 31.5.2.  Withdraw Coverage (When Beneficiary Still Eligible).  The member must submit the request to HQ AFPC/DPPRT, 550 C Street West, Suite 3, Randolph AFB, TX 78150-4713.  Costs and coverage terminate effective the first day of the seventh month after the application is received by HQ AFPC/DPPRT. 31.5.3.  Reduction of Annuity.  The retiree may request to reduce the survivor annuity to an amount not less than 12 ½ percent of the member’s retired pay or not less than a $25 monthly annuity.  The reduction is effective the first day of the seventh month following the month HQ AFPC/DPPRT receives the request. 31.6.  Impact  of  Other  Federal  Benefits  on  the  RSFPP  Annuity.    An  RSFPP  annuity  is  not subject  to  offset  by  DIC.    Exception:    The  survivor  of  a  member,  retired  for  physical disability with less than 19 years of service (18 years of service before 13 August 1968), may not be paid an RSFPP annuity if entitled to DIC from the VA.   In this case, the survivor is refunded premiums paid by the member for the RSFPP annuity. 46 AFI36-3006  7 OCTOBER 2009 31.6.1.  An RSFPP annuity is not subject to a reduction when the surviving spouse attains age 62. 31.6.2.  There  is  no  conflict  between  Civil  Service  survivor  payments  and  an  RSFPP annuity.  A beneficiary may receive both even though the retiree waived military retired pay  for  Civil  Service  retirement  and  elected  survivor  coverage  under  the  Civil  Service program.    A  retiree  who  waives  military  retired  pay  for  Civil  Service  retirement  remits RSFPP premiums directly to DFAS-CL. 31.7.  Evidence  of  RSFPP  Participation.    Neither  certificates  nor  policies  are  issued  as evidence  of  RSFPP  participation.    DFAS-CL  sends  the  retiree  a  pay  statement  each  time there is a change to the retired pay which verifies RSFPP participation. 31.8.  COLA  Adjustments  for  Certain  Beneficiaries.    The  RSFPP  annuity  of  a  beneficiary whose sponsor died before 21 March 1974 is adjusted proportionately by the COLAs applied to  military  retired  pay.    The  annuity  for  the  survivor  of  a  participant  whose  death  occurred after  21 March 1974  is  a  fixed  percentage  of  the  member’s  retired  pay  as  of  the  date  of retirement and is not cost-of-living adjusted. 31.9.  Application Process.  Payment of this annuity is not automatic.  A properly completed DD  Form  2656-7,  Verification  for  Survivor  Annuity,  has  to  be  completed  and  submitted  in accordance with instructions contained in AFI 36-3002.

The Survivor (Spouse’s Name  Street Address City, State, ZIP Code)  Dear ______________   Benefit Plan (SBP) is a program that provides survivors a monthly annuity that starts when the member dies.  Although you may not have been aware of it, you are automatically covered by the SBP at the maximum level while your (husband/wife) remains on active duty.  The government provides this protection at no cost to the member while (he/she) remains on active duty.  Before retiring, your (husband/wife) must decide whether or not to continue SBP coverage into retirement because, after retiring, SBP coverage is no longer free.   By law, you will be protected by maximum SBP coverage after your (husband/wife) retires unless you concur in (his/her) decision to elect lower coverage, to decline coverage, or to elect coverage only for your dependent children.  If SBP coverage is elected, a monthly premium will be deducted from (his/her) Air Force retired pay.  If coverage is declined for eligible family members at retirement, arbitrary enrollment at a later date is prohibited.  Members cannot enroll in the SBP after retiring; however, if coverage is elected at retirement, it can be permanently terminated between the 25th and 36th month after retiring if the protection is no longer needed or in the event of a financial crisis.  The Air Force urges you and your (husband/wife) to carefully weigh the many advantages of the SBP and it’s importance in your estate planning.    Because your financial security will be significantly affected by your (husband’s/wife’s) SBP  decision, it is important that you understand the Plan.  Please read the enclosed handout which explains beneficiary categories, amounts of coverage, costs, annuity amounts, etc.  In addition, the Air Force strongly encourages you to attend an SBP briefing with your (husband/wife) which is scheduled on (   date   ) at (   time and location   ).   You may contact me at (telephone number) for further information or if you have any questions.   Sincerely                SBP Counselor’s Name and Grade Title       Attachments: 1. 2.

Your spouse’s military retirement pay will stop when he/she dies.  SBP was designed to The law requires your written concurrence if your husband/wife declines coverage, elects All members with a spouse or dependent children are automatically covered by the SBP at the maximum level while they remain on active duty.  If your spouse dies in the line of duty while on active duty, you would currently be eligible for a monthly annuity valued at 55 percent of the retired pay he/she would be entitled to receive if retired on the date of death.  This coverage is provided at no cost while he/she remains on active duty.  Prior to retiring, the member must decide whether to continue that SBP coverage for you into retirement.  The retired pay of members who elect to participate is reduced by monthly premiums.  If he/she chooses not to participate in the SBP, an annuity cannot be paid to you.  Spouse Concurrence.   to provide reduced coverage, or to provide an annuity to a child, but not to you.  Your concurrence is not required if he/she elects former spouse coverage.    Base Amount.   amount‖ the retiring member elects.  The base amount is not the amount of the annuity - it is the amount used to compute the cost and the annuity.  The base amount can be equal to the member’s gross monthly retired pay or just a portion, down to as little as $300.  When retired pay increases because of cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs), so does the base amount, and as a result, so do premiums and the annuity payable.  Beneficiary Categories Available When Retiring Member Is Married.  SBP premiums and the amount of the annuity depend on the level of coverage or ―base Coverage is elected for a category of beneficiary, not a specifically named person.  For example, spouse coverage covers not only the retiring member’s present spouse, but any future spouse if the current marriage ends in death or divorce.  A married member can elect one of the following categories of beneficiary:  Spouse Coverage  -  An annuity will be payable for the lifetime of the spouse, and is not interrupted if remarriage occurs after age 55.  The annuity, however, is suspended if you remarry before age 55 and resumes if that remarriage ends by death or divorce.   A spouse married to a member at retirement is eligible for SBP regardless of the length of marriage.  However, divorce terminates the spouse’s eligibility to receive the annuity.  In order 56 AFI36-3006  7 OCTOBER 2009 to maintain coverage following a divorce, the beneficiary category has to be changed from spouse to former spouse.    Former Spouse Coverage  -  This option may be taken voluntarily by a retiring member, or mandated by a divorce agreement.  Because the provisions of the SBP do not allow a member to elect coverage for both a former spouse and a spouse, election of this coverage precludes coverage for a spouse.    Child Coverage  -  Eligible children may also be SBP beneficiaries.  The member may elect child only coverage or add child coverage to spouse or former spouse coverage.  Only one annuity is payable.  In an election for spouse and child, or former spouse and child, eligible children are paid the annuity only if the spouse or former spouse dies or remarries before age 55.  When child coverage is included with former spouse coverage, only children of the marriage to that former spouse are covered.  Any other children will not be paid benefits under this option.  In a child only option or when children are included with spouse coverage, all eligible children are covered.  Eligible children include dependent adopted children, stepchildren, foster children,  grandchildren, and recognized natural children who live with the retiree in a regular parent-child relationship.  To qualify as a dependent child, a grandchild must be in the care and custody of the retiree grandparent by court order and meet dependency requirements.  To qualify as a dependent child, a foster child must receive over one-half support from the member and such support must not have been provided under a social agency contract.  Children qualify for payments only during the time they are unmarried and: Under age 18; or Over age 18, but under age 22 and still in school full time; or Suffer a mental or physical incapacity incurred while still eligible as defined above.   SBP Costs.   the attached SBP cost and annuity estimate for costs specific to you and your family. To maintain SBP coverage, SBP premiums must be paid after the member retires.  See   Premiums are paid by reducing retired pay, and they are not counted in taxable income.  This means less tax and less out-of-pocket cost for SBP.  Also, the overall plan is funded (subsidized) by the government, so the average premiums are well below cost.  Child coverage is relatively inexpensive because children are normally eligible for benefits for a short time.  Premiums are suspended when there is no longer an eligible beneficiary in a premium category, such as:  A spouse is lost through death or divorce, or All eligible children marry or become too old for benefits    Annuity Payable to Beneficiary(ies).  The annuity payable to a spouse beneficiary is 55 percent of the selected base amount.   AFI36-3006  7 OCTOBER 2009 57  Eligible children equally divide the annuity which is 55 percent of the base amount.  EXAMPLE:  If five children are eligible, each is paid one-fifth of the annuity.  When the first child reaches age 18 with no incapacity and if no longer in school, each of the remaining four children are paid one-fourth of the annuity.  This process continues until the youngest child is no longer eligible to receive benefits.  Estate Planning Information.   SBP protects part of the retired pay against the risks of:  The member’s early death  -  SBP is designed to protect against the complete loss of military retired pay when the member dies; and The widow(er) outliving the benefits; and The ravages of inflation  -  Inflation erodes the value of fixed incomes, making them worth less and less as time goes by.  SBP protects against this risk because of COLAs.  Still, SBP alone is not a complete estate plan.  Other insurance and investments are   important in meeting needs outside the scope of SBP.  For example, SBP does not have a lump sum benefit that some survivors may need to meet immediate expenses upon a member’s death.   On the other hand, insurance and investments without SBP may be less than adequate.  Investments may be risky and rely on a degree of financial expertise many people don’t have.  Consider everything carefully.  Don’t expect SBP to do it all, but give it full credit for what it does.    Is SBP a Good Buy?   Given the government subsidy, the answer to this question is yes!  Whether SBP is a good buy for your family depends on personal preferences and the age, sex, and health of the member and spouse.  Beyond this, the answer lies in such questions you should ask yourself.  First, is a subsidized, lifetime, inflation-protected income something that could help my family? Second, how much SBP can I use?   If you know when your spouse will die, how long you will outlive your spouse, and how much inflation will occur, you have the answer.  The unknown future is the problem, but SBP meets the need!  Even if the member dies shortly after retiring and you live for 50 more years and if inflation is higher than expected, SBP will still be paying.  It will probably be paying a lot more than anyone ever expected because inflation has a strong impact over a long period of time.  In fact, survivors who began to get SBP benefits in the early 1970s have seen their benefits tripled through COLAs! Third, is SBP affordable?  Due to the subsidy and lack of administrative costs and profit, the Plan is very reasonable.  And remember:  the tax advantage on premiums reduces the out-of-pocket cost.  58 AFI36-3006  7 OCTOBER 2009 Age 62 Annuity Reduction Eliminated.  Public Law 108-375 was signed into law Recent Plan Improvements.   28 October 2004.  It authorized the phased elimination of the age-62 reduction to a spouse’s SBP annuity.  Effective 1 April 2008. every surviving spouse, regardless of age, will receive 55 percent of the base amount elected.   Disenrollment Provision.  A survey of non-participating retirees indicated the main reason they did not elect SBP at retirement was uncertainty regarding post-service employment and fear of making a decision that could not be changed.  This led to one of the latest improvements in the Plan - making it more flexible.  Retirees are now authorized a one-year window between their second and third anniversary of receiving retired pay in which they can disenroll.  That allows members who may have a financial crisis or simply decide they no longer need the SBP protection for their survivors to permanently get out of the Plan.  This requires the concurrence of the spouse, there is no refund of premiums, and they will be forever barred from reentering.  Once the window closes, the election is irrevocable as long as the beneficiary remains eligible.    Paid-Up Provision.  Public Law 105-261 was signed into law 17 October 1998.  It stipulates that effective 1 October 2008, retired members age 70 or older, who have paid premiums for a level of coverage for at least 30 years, will be considered ―Paid-Up.‖  No further premiums will be deducted from their retired pay for that level of coverage, but their eligible beneficiary will still receive an SBP annuity when they die.   Affects of receiving VA Disability Compensation.  If the member dies of service-connected causes, a spouse may qualify for Dependency Some people think a retired member can join SBP years after retiring, during a so-called and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) from the VA.  This tax-free benefit reduces, dollar-for-dollar, the basic SBP benefit for a spouse.  When all or part of an SBP annuity is offset by DIC, premiums for the offset portion are refunded to the spouse.    Can my spouse enroll in the SBP after he/she retires?   "open season."  In the 30-plus-year history of SBP, only four times have retirees had a second chance at SBP.  Each time was after major plan improvements.  The second time, premiums were raised for new enrollees to help make up for the missed premiums.  The last two times, new enrollees were required to pay all missed premiums with interest, plus an additional amount to protect the solvency of the Plan.  Open enrollment elections have typically required a two-year waiting period before the election went into effect.  This was to prevent new enrollees from having an adverse effect on the Plan (people joining with short life expectations).  Although an open season may be enacted by special law, they are not part of the regular Plan.  There may not be another.  Note:  This is not a contract document.

A member who makes an election for former spouse coverage is prohibited from concurrently electing coverage for his/her present spouse.  Child coverage can be included in a former spouse election; however, only children resulting from the marriage of the member and the former spouse are eligible in a former spouse and child election.  In this case, the former spouse is the primary beneficiary; eligible children receive an annuity only if the former spouse remarries before age 55 or dies.   Benefit Payments. The amount of the monthly SBP annuity is determined by the level of coverage or ―base amount‖ elected.  The base amount is not the amount paid to the former spouse; rather, it is the amount used to compute both the monthly cost and annuity.  The base amount may range from a minimum of $300 up to a maximum of the member’s gross retired pay.  The annuity payable is 55 percent of the base amount elected for former spouses.   Suspension of Coverage and Premiums Due to Former Spouse’s Remarriage Before Age 55. If a former spouse remarries before age 55, SBP coverage is suspended for the duration of that marriage.  The member must notify the Defense Finance and Accounting Service - Cleveland Center (DFAS-CL, U. S. Military Retirement Pay, PO Box 7130, London, KY  40742-7130) and provide a copy of the former spouse’s remarriage certificate in order that premiums can be suspended.    If the former spouse’s remarriage ends, coverage is reinstated the day following the termination of the former spouse’s remarriage.  Former spouse premiums are reinstated effective the first day of the month after the date the former spouse’s remarriage terminates.  The member must immediately notify the Defense Finance and Accounting Service - Cleveland Center (DFAS-CL, U. S. Military Retirement Pay, PO Box 7130, London, KY  40742-7130) and provide a copy of the former spouse’s divorce decree or the death certificate of the person to whom the former spouse was married so that coverage and premiums can be reestablished in a timely manner to avoid a debt of premiums.    If the member dies during the period the former spouse coverage is suspended because of the former spouse’s remarriage before age 55, the former spouse would be eligible for the annuity in the event the remarriage subsequently terminated.  The former spouse must notify the Defense Finance and Accounting Service - Cleveland Center (DFAS-CL, U. S. Military Annuitant Pay, PO Box 7131, London, KY  40742-7131) and provide a copy of the divorce decree or the death certificate of the person to whom the former spouse was married so the annuity can be established.      64 AFI36-3006  7 OCTOBER 2009 A former spouse who remarries at age 55 or older remains eligible to receive the annuity.  SBP coverage and premiums remain in effect.  Coverage For Former Spouse And Child(ren). The eligible child(ren) resulting from the marriage of the member and designated former spouse are covered when an election is made for former spouse and child coverage.  Eligible child(ren) are contingent beneficiaries and receive the SBP annuity if the former spouse remarries before age 55 or dies.  Eligible child(ren) divide the annuity in equal shares.  Children remain eligible as long as they are unmarried and under age 18, or at least 18 but under 22 if a full-time student in an accredited school.  A child who is disabled and incapable of self-support remains eligible for life or as long as disabled and unmarried if the disability occurred before age 18 (or before age 22 if a full-time student when the disability occurred).  Changes in Former Spouse Coverage. A member may terminate former spouse or former spouse and child coverage in order to elect coverage for a spouse, child(ren), or spouse and child(ren).  In order to elect child coverage, the election change must be submitted within 1 year of acquiring the dependent child(ren).  If the election change is from former spouse to spouse coverage, there is no time limitation on the election period.  If the member elects to change from former spouse to spouse coverage after 1 year of remarriage, the coverage is effective on the date the election is received by DFAS-CL and the associated premium is effective on the first day of the month after election receipt.  Former spouse coverage, however, can be terminated ONLY under one of the following conditions:   certified copy of a court order that modifies all previous court orders relieving the retiree of a court-ordered former spouse election must be furnished to DFAS-CL (DFAS-CL, U. S. Military Retirement Pay, PO Box 7130, London, KY  40742-7130) along with a request to convert to spouse, child, or spouse and child coverage; or   voluntarily by the member and former spouse as a part of or incident to the proceedings of a divorce, a modified written agreement signed by the former spouse agreeing to the change must be furnished to DFAS-CL (DFAS-CL, U. S. Military Retirement Pay, PO Box 7130, London, KY  40742-7130) along with a request to convert to spouse, child, or spouse and child coverage.   written agreement), the election CAN be changed to cover a new spouse, child, or spouse and child without submitting an amended court order or modified written agreement. The member must submit a request to convert to spouse, child, or spouse and child coverage to DFAS-CL (DFAS-CL, U. S. Military Retirement Pay, PO Box 7130, London, KY  40742-7130).  The former spouse is notified of the change in election.  Annuity Payments To Surviving Former Spouse. A surviving former spouse who is receiving an annuity may remarry at age 55 or older and continue to receive the annuity payments.  If remarriage occurs before age 55, SBP annuity a.
