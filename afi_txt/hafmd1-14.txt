BY ORDER OF THE  SECRETARY OF THE AIR FORCE HAF MISSION DIRECTIVE 1-14  29 DECEMBER 2016   GENERAL COUNSEL AND THE JUDGE ADVOCATE GENERAL    1.1. The General Counsel of the Department of the Air Force (SAF/GC) is established within the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) by Title 10 United States Code Sections (U.S.C. §§) 8014 and 8019.  SAF/GC,  subject  to  the  direction  and  control  of  SECAF,  serves  as  the  chief  legal  officer  and Designated Agency Ethics Official (DAEO) of the Department of the Air Force. SAF/GC also serves as the civil administrator of Wake  Island and performs such other duties as assigned to assist the SECAF in carrying out his/her responsibilities under 10 U.S.C. § 8013. SAF/GC assists the SECAF, the Assistant Secretaries, the Chief of Staff (CSAF), Secretariat and Air Staff offices, and other Air Force offices in carrying out their responsibilities to provide legal services for the Department of the Air Force. Within his/her  areas  of  responsibility,  SAF/GC  prepares  policies  for  approval  and issues  official guidance/procedures, via official Air Force (AF) publications, to ensure implementation of these policies.  1.2. The Judge Advocate General (TJAG), pursuant  to  10  U.S.C. §§ 8031-8038, and as documented by Paragraph 4.3.5. of AFMD-1,  is established as part of the Air Staff. Under 10 U.S.C. § 8037, TJAG is the legal advisor of the SECAF and of all officers and agencies of the Department of the Air Force. TJAG assists the SECAF, the Assistant Secretaries, the CSAF, Secretariat and Air Staff offices, and other Air Force offices in carrying out their responsibilities to provide legal services for the Department of the Air Force.  Within  his/her  areas  of  responsibility,  TJAG  prepares  policies  for  approval  and  issues  official guidance/procedures, via official AF publications, to ensure implementation of those policies. TJAG also assists the CSAF in his/her role, pursuant to 10 U.S.C. § 151, as a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS).   2. Organizational Relationships. The SECAF is responsible for, and has all legal authority necessary to conduct, the affairs of the Department of the Air Force. The Secretariat, the CSAF, and Air Staff offices perform their Department of the Air Force functions subject to the authority, direction, and control of the SECAF.  2  HAFMD1-14   29 DECEMBER 2016 2.1. The SAF/GC reports directly to the SECAF and serves as agent of the SECAF within assigned policy and program domains, but also provides support to the Secretariat, the CSAF and other Air Staff offices, and provides guidance, direction, and oversight for all matters pertaining to the formulation, review, and execution of plans, policies, programs, and budgets within his/her area of responsibility. The SAF/GC is accountable to the SECAF for results achieved within the policy and program domains assigned by this Directive or otherwise delegated by SECAF to SAF/GC.   2.1.1. The SAF/GC and the Office of the SAF/GC work in cooperation with TJAG, the Office of The Judge Advocate General, and Air Force Legal Operations Agency (AFLOA) offices (collectively referred to as AF/JA), that share functional areas with SAF/GC, as well as other Air Force organizations, which are responsible, pursuant to Chapters 803 and 805 of Title 10 (10 U.S.C. §§ 8013-8023 and §§ 8031-8038), for assisting the SECAF in carrying out his/her responsibilities.  2.2. TJAG reports directly to the CSAF, but  also  provides support to the SECAF, the Secretariat, and other Air Staff offices, and provides guidance, direction, and oversight for all matters pertaining to the formulation,  review,  and  execution  of  plans,  policies,  programs,  and  budgets  within  his/her  area  of responsibility.  The  SECAF  may  re-delegate  authority/assign  responsibility  to  TJAG,  but  the  SECAF, through  the  CSAF  and,  as  appropriate,  Assistant  Secretaries  of  the  Air  Force,  retains  ultimate responsibility.    2.2.1. TJAG is part of the Air Staff and as such works closely with other HAF offices to assist the SECAF and the CSAF in carrying out their responsibilities. TJAG and AF/JA offices work in cooperation with SAF/GC, as well as other HAF organizations, which are responsible, pursuant to Chapters 803 and 805 of Title 10 (10 U.S.C. §§ 8013-8023 and §§ 8031-8038), for assisting the SECAF and the CSAF in carrying out their responsibilities.  2.3. Pursuant to Headquarters Operating Instruction (HOI) 90-1, Headquarters Air Force Mission Directive – Delegations of Authority and Assignment of Responsibilities, two or more HAF 2-letter organizations with responsibilities in the same functional area are encouraged to develop “standard operating procedures (SOP)” that set forth procedures enabling covered organizations to fulfill and carry out their respective missions,  roles,  and  responsibilities.  The  SOP  entered  into  between  the  GC  and  TJAG  is  included  at Attachment 4 (Functions List) of this HAF Mission Directive.  In the event of conflict between the SOP and other provisions of this mission directive GC and TJAG will personally resolve the conflict.  2.4. Reporting to the TJAG is a field operating agency, the Air Force Legal Operations Agency (AFLOA).  3. Responsibilities. Both SAF/GC and TJAG are responsible for providing legal services consistent with the  authorities  and  limitations  of  this  Mission  Directive.  The  areas  of  legal  practice  and  the  specific, respective responsibilities of both offices are described below and in the SOP at Attachment 4.  3.1.  The  relationship  between  SAF/GC  and TJAG  is  based  on  the  complementary  roles  that  Congress intended for these offices when it established SAF/GC as part of the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force and TJAG as part of the Air Staff. Both are legal advisors to SECAF and CSAF, with right of direct access and the ability to provide independent legal advice to those officials. SAF/GC and TJAG are independent of each other for the purposes of rating, reporting, and the accomplishment of their responsibilities. They perform their missions in an environment of collaboration and information sharing. In the event that an office of SAF/GC or AF/JA is aware of a significant legal issue, including a matter of first impression, or an issue that can foreseeably be a matter of significant interest to senior Air Force leadership, the White House, Congress, the Department of Defense, other federal agencies, the public, or the media, that office will ensure that the corresponding office in SAF/GC or AF/JA is made aware of the matter and provided an opportunity to comment.  HAFMD1-14   29 DECEMBER 2016  3   3.1.1. AF/JA leads most civil litigation efforts on behalf of the Air Force. SAF/GC and AF/JA closely collaborate on civil litigation involving contract fraud remedies, special access programs, major weapon-system acquisition programs, and significant policy implications to determine who is best suited to lead a specific litigation  effort  in  one  of  these  areas.  SAF/GC  and  AF/JA  will  keep one  another  informed  of substantive case developments and provide an opportunity to offer input on key decisions.   3.1.2. AF/JA and SAF/GC will provide one another with timely notice of the initiation or pendency of significant or potentially significant litigation and will provide updates and an opportunity to comment quarterly and whenever a major event in that civil litigation matter occurs (e.g., a dispositive ruling by a judge).  3.1.3. Both within and outside the Air Force, for matters other than civil litigation, the office having a “Focal Point” (FP) designation described in the SOP at Attachment 4, determines and conveys Air Force legal  positions.  In  doing  so,  collaboration  and  information  sharing  is  encouraged.  When  a  function  is designated  as a  “Shared  Function” (SF),  or  when,  in  the  opinion  of  SAF/GC  or  TJAG,  circumstances otherwise warrant, SAF/GC and TJAG, through their staffs, will seek to agree on the legal positions to be taken, on which office will convey the position, and how the legal position will be communicated. This process may include consultation with the Department of Defense Office of the General Counsel. In the rare situation when agreement is not reached, SAF/GC and TJAG may both offer independent advice to the Secretary.   3.2. The SAF/GC is specifically responsible, and has all necessary authority, for duties including:  3.2.1. Assisting the SECAF in his or her capacity as a member of the President’s Administration.  3.2.2. Serving as the DAEO of the Department of the Air Force.  3.2.3.

General. These standard operating procedures (SOP) are entered into pursuant to paragraph 2.3. of Headquarters Air Force (HAF) Mission Directive (MD) 1-14. This SOP applies to the SAF/GC and the Office of the SAF/GC and to TJAG, the Office of The Judge Advocate General, and Air Force Legal Operations Agency (AFLOA) offices that share functional areas with SAF/GC (collectively referred to as AF/JA).  It  is  intended  to  facilitate  staff  interactions,  the  performance  of  functions,  and  promote  the fulfillment of client needs in an effective and efficient manner.   A4.1.1. Working Relationships. Members of SAF/GC and AF/JA will conduct their activities in a manner that maintains an environment of collegiality and mutual respect and support. Differences of view will be resolved at the lowest possible level and elevated within respective supervisory chains only as necessary.   A4.1.2. Duplication of Effort. Unnecessary duplication of effort will be avoided.   A4.2. Focal Points and Shared Functions. SAF/GC and TJAG have examined each field of practice within the HAF and have agreed upon an allocation of responsibilities using the terms Focal Point (FP) and Shared Function (SF). This allocation applies, except as may be otherwise provided by SECAF or MD 1-14 and its attachments.  A4.2.1. Focal Point. For each legal function within the HAF, there may be a single SAF/GC or AF/JA office established  as  the  FP.  Coordination  or  issuance  of  opinions  by  that  office  will  constitute  all  legal coordination that is required (“one chop”), to include two-letter coordination. The term FP connotes one formal coordination office, but may involve SAF/GC and AF/JA collaboration and information sharing.   A4.2.2. Shared Function. Where neither office is designated as an FP, the function is designated as an SF. SF functions normally require the coordination, opinion, or other action of both offices (“two chops”). When a function is an SF, the respective offices will agree to provide clients with a single legal response on behalf of both offices whenever feasible.   A4.3. Functions List. Table A4, attached, describes each HAF field of practice function, the SAF/GC and AF/JA office ordinarily responsible for each function, and FP and SF designations in the “GC Role” and “JA Role” columns. The “Notes” column may include specific instructions concerning how the function will be carried out between SAF/GC and AF/JA. As to SF designations, if there is no note, action regarding that function requires the coordination or action of both offices.     HAFMD1-14   29 DECEMBER 2016  17 A4.4. Revisions to Standard Operating Procedures. This SOP may be reviewed and revised as deemed necessary by SECAF. SAF/GC or TJAG may also initiate a revision in consultation with the other office. Offices  of  primary  responsibility  (OPRs)  must  follow  revision  procedures  as  mandated  in  HOI  90-1, Headquarters  Air  Force  Mission  Directives  –  Delegations  of  Statutory  Authority  and  Assignment  of Responsibilities.    //signed 28 Nov 2016/// GORDON O.

All HAF actions remain a GCQ "single chop."    40  HAFMD1-14   29 DECEMBER 2016 Item # 275 GC Dep GCQ JA Office JAQ  Major Function Sub-Function Acquisition Policy and Legislation  Advice to AQ GC Role FP JA Role  276 GCQ JAQ  277 GCQ JAQ Field Support General Acquisition Legal Advice to Government Members of Acquisition Teams    FP FP 278 GCQ JAQ Commercial Litigation  FP All Commercial Litigation – i.e., Bid Protests (GAO and COFC), ASBCA Claims, COFC Claims, IP-Related Litigation, and Bankruptcy Matters.   279 GCQ JAQ 280 GCQ JAQ Mergers and Acquisitions (including CFIUS and FOCI) Multi-Functional Independent Review Team   FP SF  NOTES GCQ will obtain JAQ input when coordinating on significant acquisition policy matters (e.g., policies impacting AFJAGC personnel providing acquisition legal support).  When appropriate, JAQ shall offer views from contract field support and litigation field support to inform acquisition policy.    Unless otherwise provided, JAQ advises Government members of Acquisition Teams. JAQ will be the FP for reach-back acquisition law support to the field for procurements other than those managed by a PEO.  For major defense acquisition programs and other procurements managed by a PEO, JAQ shall coordinate with GCQ before providing support or legal advice to the field.  JAQ shall provide GCQ with periodic reports summarizing the types of field support provided, trends identified, and subject matter areas requiring policy changes or training requirements.  When GCQ is not part of the immediate legal team, but the legal issue affects SAF/AQ, then GCQ should be notified. JAQ will keep GC informed on the status of ongoing litigation.  For protests of ACAT I programs and programs where GC is the legal advisor to the source selection team, claims greater than $25M, and litigation of special interest, GC and JA share these functions.  Special interest litigation (e.g. media, OSD, SAF interest) often requires high-level coordination on aggressive timelines.  GCQ may designate a GCQ POC to ensure effective coordination and ability to meet litigation deadlines.  SF  When SAF/AQ, local business clearance authorities, MAJCOMs, or any other relevant authority requests a Multi-Functional Independent Review Team (MIRT) with HAF-level legal membership, GCQ and JAQ shall consult and mutually determine the identity of the legal membership. HAFMD1-14   29 DECEMBER 2016  41 Item # 281 GC Dep GCQ JA Office JAQ GC Role SF JA Role SF Major Function Sub-Function Extended Debriefing Pilot Program In an effort to dissuade unsuccessful offerors from filing protests based on speculation, the Air Force is conducting a pilot program to utilize extended debriefings in appropriate cases. 282 GCQ JAQ 283 GCQ JAQ 284 GCQ JAQ 285 286 287 288 289 290 291 292 GCR GCR GCR GCR GCR GCR GCR GCR JAQ JAQ JAQ JAQ JAQ JAQ JAQ JAQ 293 GCR JAQ 294 GCR JAQ 295 296 GCR GCQ GCR JAQ JAQ Intellectual Property Issues (including Data Rights, Commercial Software, Licenses and Patents) Acquisition Issues Related to Cybersecurity  Acquisition Issues Related to Special Access Programs  Suspension and Debarment       Fraud Remedies        Intake and Review of ROI/Information  Coordinate Lead Agency Develop Record for Decision SDO Decision on Suspension or Debarment Review/Defend Decision as Needed Conduct World-Wide Training  Review Incoming Investigative Materials Coordinate with DOJ, AUSAs, Investigators, Auditors, DCMA, and Contracting Reps Qui Tam Support Administrative Agreements  SF SF FP FP FP FP FP FP FP FP SF SF SF              SF SF SF  NOTES GCQ and JAQ will work together to assess the success of the pilot program, to develop and finalize the Concept of Operations, and draft and implement policy and regulations concerning the process.
