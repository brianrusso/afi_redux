This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive education and training document that identifies life-cycle education and training requirements, training support resources and minimum core task requirements for this special duty identifier (SDI).  The CFETP will provide personnel a clear career path to success and will instill rigor in all aspects of special duty training. 2.  The CFETP consists of two parts; both parts of the plan are used by supervisors to plan, manage and control training within the SDI. 2.1.  Part I provides information necessary for overall management of training in the SDI.  Section A explains how everyone will use the plan; Section B identifies SDI progression information, duties and responsibilities, training strategies and SDI path; Section C illustrates SDI training requirements;  Section D indicates resource constraints such as funding, manpower, equipment and facilities. 2.2.  Part II includes the following:  Section A identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS) and includes duties, tasks, and technical references to support training.  Sections B, C and D are not used. 3.  Using guidance provided in the CFETP will ensure individuals in this SDI receive effective and efficient training.  At unit level, supervisors and trainers will use Part II to identify, plan and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan. 1 Abbreviations/Terms Explained Air Force Career Field Manager (AFCFM) - Individual on the Air Staff charged with the responsibility for overseeing all training and career field management aspects of an Air Force specialty or group of specialties. Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) - A combination of numbers and alpha characters used to identify  an Air Force specialty.  Enlisted AFSCs consists of five characters. Career Field Education Training Plan (CFETP) - A CFETP is a comprehensive, multipurpose document encapsulating the entire spectrum of training for a career field or Special Duty Identifier  (SDI). It outlines a logical growth plan that includes training resources and is designed to make career  field or SDI training identifiable, to eliminate duplication, and to ensure this training is budget  defensible. Core Task - Tasks the AFCFM identifies as a minimum qualification requirement within an AFSC, regardless of duty position. Facility Manager OJT Instructor - Instructor who provides qualification, recurring and remedial training of management tasks. Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) - Minuteman III missile weapon system. Indoctrination Training - Initial training required for performing FM duties; normally completed on base. Missile Alert Facility (MAF) - Provides lodging, protection, and a controlled environment for launch control operation personnel and equipment. Noncommissioned Officer in Charge MAF (NCOIC) - FM responsible for the effective management, supervision and training of assigned MAF managers. Missile Alert Facility Manager (FM) - SDI personnel who manage the MAF.  Directly responsible to the MAF Senior FM and flight commander for the effective performance of the MAF management tasks. Missile Squadron - Unit FMs are assigned to. Operations Group (OG) - Group missile squadrons are assigned to. On-The-Job Training (OJT) -  Hands-on, over-the-shoulder training conducted to certify personnel  in job qualification (duty position certification) training. Operations Support Squadron (OSS) - The unit the missile alert facility manager training instructor  is assigned to. 2                Resource Constraints - Resource deficiencies, such as money, facilities, time, manpower and  equipment that preclude training from being delivered. Qualification Training - Task training provided through OJT at the MAF. Special Duty Assignment Pay (SDAP) – Incentive to induce enlisted members to qualify for and serve in designated duties involving the performance of extremely difficult duties or duties demanding an unusual degree of responsibility.  Special Duty Identifier (SDI) - A four or five-digit code and title used to identify manpower positions and persons performing duties not clearly within a specific career field. Specialty Training Standard (STS) - An Air Force publication that describes an Air Force specialty/SDI in terms of task and knowledge which an individual in that specialty may be expected to perform or to know how on the job, and identifies the training provided to achieve a 3-, 5-, and 7-skill level with an enlisted AFS.  It further serves as a contract between AETC and the functional user to show which of the overall training requirements for an Air Force specialty code (AFSC) are taught in  formal schools and correspondence courses. Operations Group FM Superintendent MAF Management - Responsible to the group commander for ensuring quality MAF management, training and evaluation programs. Squadron Superintendent - Person assigned as single point of contact within each missile squadron concerning MAF management issues. Standard - An exact value, a physical entity, or an abstract concept, established and defined by  authority, custom, or common consent to serve as a reference, model, or rule in measuring quantities or  qualities, establishing practices or procedures, evaluating results.  A fixed quantity or quality. Training/Technical Reference (TR) - Any documentation used to support training. Trainer - A trained, certified person who teaches personnel to perform certain tasks through OJT methods or equipment that the trainer uses to teach personnel specified tasks. 3          PART I Section A – GENERAL INFORMATION 1.  Purpose. 1.1.  This CFETP provides information that SDI functional managers, training managers, commanders, supervisors and trainers use to plan, develop, manage and conduct an effective and efficient SDI training program.  The plan standardizes training for all facility managers.  This CFETP accurately  reflects what is necessary for facility manager (FM) qualification training to prepare for missile alert  facility duties.  This plan does not address ancillary training.  The CFETP has several purposes: 1.1.1.  Serves as a management tool to plan, develop, manage and conduct a SDI training program. Establishes baseline training requirements for initial qualification for SDI 8S000 duties. 1.1.2.  Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for performing facility manager and support duties. 1.1.3.  Identifies progression opportunities within the FM SDI and describes the duty requirements for each major position within the SDI. 1.1.4.  Identifies the requirements for attending professional development. 1.1.5.  Identifies major resource constraints that impact implementation of the desired SDI program. 2.  Uses. 2.1.  This plan is used by managers in all FM programs to ensure comprehensive, standardized training programs which develop qualified FMs able to meet the unique requirements of each facility manager  and support position. 2.2.  Operations  Group  FM  Superintendents  MAF  Management,  OSS  FM  Instructors,  and  Squadron Superintendents  will  ensure  their  training  programs  compliment  the  mandatory  facility  manager qualification training  requirements. 2.3.  OSS FM Instructors will use the CFETP to program training requirements for personnel engaged  in FM OJT training and evaluating facility managers. 2.4.  Individual must ensure he/she completes mandatory training requirements specified in this plan. Part II identifies mandatory training requirements and identifies sources for the required training. 3.  Coordination and Approval. 3.1.  20 AF/A3NF must conduct an annual review of the CFETP and report inadequacies to the AFCFM not later than 45 days prior to the anniversary date of the CFETP (as printed in the upper right corner of the CFETP).  Negative replies are required.  20 AF/A3NF will  consolidate inputs for submission to the AFCFM. 4                  3.2.  AFCFM will serve as the OPR for the CFETP.  20 AF/A3NF will host U&TW as directed by  the AFCFM, to determine 8S000 training requirements and revise and/or develop an effective CFETP.  20 AF/A3NF will maintain the CFETP, suggest necessary revisions and submit new or revised  CFETP versions to the AFCFM for action. 3.3.  The AFCFM, by letter, has delegated the authority to review and coordinate the CFETP to 20 AF/A3NF.  The AFCFM will request 20 AF/A3NF conduct a U&TW when it appears major revision or replacement of the CFETP is necessary to meet mission requirements.  Upon approval by  the AFCFM, 20 AF/A3NF will publish, issue, announce and index the CFETP in accordance with AFI 36-2201, Volume 5, Air Force Training Program Career Field Education and Training.   5 Section B – Facility Manager Opportunities and Information  4.  Specialty Descriptions. 4.1.  The purpose of this section is to identify opportunities and duty positions within the Facility Manager SDI 8S000.  By evaluation of what is available and the specific demands of each position, NCOs can decide:  (1) if they want to apply for FM duty and/or (2) where they would like to be assigned. 4.2.  Unlike “typical” career fields such as security forces, maintenance or supply, a career progression ladder does not exist for the FM SDI 8S000.  Since individual’s perceptions and values control how we see a particular move within facility management, rather than a systematic evolution of training and experience, it is impossible to identify a standardized or typical career path an 8S000 might follow as  they progress within the SDI.  “Opportunities” are functionally organized in three basic areas: management, facility managers and support. 4.3.  FM positions (management, facility managers, and support) are controlled duty tours.  Tour  length is standardized at 4 years.  Special duty tour extensions are requested and approved on a case-by-case basis by AFPC. 4.4.  FM Duty Titles and Job Descriptions.  Note:  The duty titles Manager MAF Operations and OG FM Superintendent MAF Management are reserved for specific positions and are not authorized for general use as optional duty titles.  The following duty titles and their accompanying job descriptions are intended to describe positions available throughout  the 8S000 SDI for those performing like duties.  The duty description, not the title, may be modified to  meet the unique local conditions and/or additional duties.  These examples are provided merely as  illustrations and are not intended to limit a commander’s/superintendent’s authority to clearly identify  duty requirements within an operational group. 4.4.1.

A degree program does not exist for the 8S000 SDI, however, individuals are highly encouraged to complete their secondary AFSC degree if not previously awarded. 6.2.  A detailed list of indoctrination and qualification training requirements can be found in   AFGSCI13-5305, Missile Facility Management.  6.3 Selection Criteria 6.3.1.  This section establishes broad policy guidelines for those involved in recruiting and selecting individuals for Facility Manager duty.  Its purpose is to ensure that only the highest quality candidates, who meet mission essential criteria, are selected for FM duty.  It identifies mandatory requirements for 8S000 duties and desirable qualifications, which should be considered when screening FM applicants. 6.3.2.  The mandatory hiring practices apply to all 8S000 managers engaged in recruiting, screening,  and selecting personnel for FM duties.  The qualifications specified apply to all potential 8S000s, not  just those slated for full-time facility manager positions. 7 Section C – 8S000 Training Requirements  6.  Facility Manager Training Requirements. 6.1. Although the 8S000 SDI is awarded upon entry into FM special duty, certain training requirements must be met by all 8S000 personnel to be considered fully qualified.  To ensure individuals are properly prepared for MAF management duty they are required to complete a two-phase training program.  The first phase is indoctrination training and the second phase is task qualification training.  The first phase is normally provided by the OG FM Trainer (i.e. MAF safety, CPR) or an outside agency (i.e. fuels management, weather) and includes ancillary training.  The second phase provides OJT on MAF management tasks listed in the STS.  Indoctrination and task qualification training are two separate, yet simultaneous requirements each FM must successfully complete.  Indoctrination  training will normally be completed before task qualification training is started.  Facility managers m a y  not perform unsupervised MAF management duties until they have completed both phases of  training. However, tasks listed under section 8.4, MAF Helicopter Refueling Operations, are NOT required to be completed prior to performing unsupervised MAF management duties.                              6.3.3.  The selection criteria may not be waived locally.  Any requests for waivers/deviations from this policy must be submitted by the unit commander to the AFCFM or AFPC/DPAA4 IAW AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted). 6.3.4.  Individuals selected for FM duties must meet the following qualifications for entry, award and retention of the SDI. 6.3.4.1.  Must be in the grade of SSgt through MSgt. 6.3.4.2.  Must have a skill level commensurate with grade in current AFSC. 6.3.4.3.  Must not possess a record of emotional instability, disciplinary action, or financial irresponsibility. 6.3.4.4.  Must meet requirements for 8S000 SDI entry per Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory. 6.3.4.4.1.  Aptitude - Mechanical 40 6.3.4.4.2.  Strength Aptitude Test – 50 lbs. 6.3.4.4.3.  Physical Profile 6.3.4.5.  Must meet PCS eligibility requirements. 6.3.4.6.  Must meet current fitness standards. 6.3.4.7.  Copies of last five performance reports. 6.3.4.8.  Ability to obtain 48 months retainability as of the reporting month. 6.3.4.9.  Must be a United States citizen and possess a current Secret security clearance. 6.4.  Core Task Requirements.  SDI 8S000 currently does not have any core or critical tasks. Section D – Resource Constraints  7.  Purpose.  This section identifies known resource constraints, which preclude optimal desired training from being developed or conducted, including information such as funding, manpower, equipment and facilities.  A narrative explanation of resource constraints and an impact statement describing what effect each constraint has on training is included.  Resource constraints will be reviewed and updated annually.  7.1.  General Information:  FM duty is a selectively-manned special duty requiring 4-year controlled tours and mandatory training requirements to gain proficiency to be fully qualified.  All training requirements are outlined in this CFETP.  8     7.2.  Constraints: 7.2.1.  One limiting factor affecting 8S000 qualification training is manpower availability.  Even  though entry into the 8S000 SDI is similar to retraining, currently there is no formal “pipeline”  manning process which allows newly hired facility managers to complete training prior to the date they  are required to begin FM duties.   7.2.2.  AFPC/DPAA4 must ensure this constraint is a priority with the SDI AFCFM to establish a “facility manager pipeline” allowing unit manning levels to accommodate facility manager training.  This pipeline must also assign FMs to gaining units far enough in advance of the date they are required to allow for near completion of training.  At a minimum, new FMs should not be counted against unit manning levels and should be assigned to the gaining unit a minimum of four weeks prior to their  required date of availability.  This would allow for completion of indoctrination and minimal  qualification training.  The OG FM Superintendent MAF Management shall ensure AFPC/DPAA4 is aware of unit needs.  OG FM Superintendent MAF Management must prepare for personnel losses well  in advance by reviewing manning documents and forwarding projected losses to AFPC/DPAA4. 9 Part II  Section A – Specialty Training Standard  1.  Implementation. This Specialty Training Standard (STS) is for use by personnel who possess SDI 8S000 and is mandatory for those performing FM duties.           2.  Purpose.  As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, Volume 5, Air Force Program Career Field Education and Training, this STS: 2.1.  Provides documented certification for OJT. 2.1.1.  Column 1 (Task and Technical Reference) lists the most common tasks and technical references (TR) necessary for individuals to perform duties in the 8S000 SDI.  Identify current duty position requirements by circling letters and numbers where applicable.  To identify additional 8S000  requirements, create an entry or entries on an AF Form 797. 2.1.2.  Column 2 (Core Tasks) identifies specific core tasks.  SDI 8S000 currently does not have any core tasks.  Column 8 (Certifying Official Initials) is also not used, as only core tasks require certification. 2.1.3.  Column 3 is used to record the date tasks are begun.  Column 4 is used to record the date task training is completed.  Columns 5 and 6 are where the trainee and trainer initial once task is completed. 2.2.  Becomes a job qualification standard (JQS) for on-the-job training when placed in AF Form 623, Individual Training Record, and used according to AFI 36-2201.  When used as a JQS, the following requirements apply: 2.2.1.  Documentation.  Document completion of training and qualification.  Identify duty position requirements by circling the subparagraph number next to the task statement.  As a minimum, c o m p l e t e  the following columns in Part 2 of the CFETP:  Start Date, Completion Date, Trainee Initials,  and Trainer Initials. 2.2.1.1.  Converting from Old Document to New CFETP.  Use the new CFETP to identify and qualify all past and current qualifications.  For those tasks previously qualified and required in the  current duty position, circle the task and enter current date as completion date and enter trainee’s and trainer’s initials.  For previous qualification on tasks not required in the current duty position, carry forward only the previous completion dates.  If and when the task(s) become a duty position requirement, re-qualify with circles, current date and trainee’s and trainer’s initials.  Annotate the AF  Form 623a, (for example, “I certify the information contained in the CFETP dated XX was transcribed  to the CFETP dated XX, and the trainee was given the superseded CFETP.” Signed, dated, supervisor and trainee). 2.2.1.2.  Decertification and Recertification. When an individual is found to be unqualified on a task previously qualified for his or her assigned  position,  the  supervisor/trainer erases the previous trainer’s initials.  Appropriate remarks are entered on the AF Form 623A, On-The-Job Training Record 10 Continuation Sheet, as to the reason for decertification.  The individual is re-qualified (if required) by erasing the remaining old entries and writing in new. 2.2.2.  Training Standard.  Tasks are trained and qualified to the “GO/NO GO” level.  “GO” means the individual can perform the task without assistance and meet local demands for accuracy, timeliness and correct use of procedures.
