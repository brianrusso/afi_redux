Airmen  pending  promotion  consideration  to  the  rank  of SMSgt  must  complete  Phase  3  SNCOA  or  equivalent/sister  service/international  EPME (correspondence  or  in-residence)  on  or  before  the  Promotion  Eligibility  Cut-off  Date  (PECD). PME  deferments  may  be  processed  for  Airmen  in  situations  described  in  Table  1.2,  Note  4.     (T-3). In the case that an Airman has a promotion sequence number and has not completed their required  distance  learning,  he  or  she  will  be  placed  into  a  promotion  withhold  status.    The withhold  status  will  be  removed  upon  course  completion  or  it  will  expire  at  the  end  of  the promotion cycle where the line number will be cancelled. 1.13.  Community  College  of  the  Air  Force  (CCAF)  Requirements.  Airmen  eligible  for promotion  to  SMSgt  and  CMSgt  must  have  a  conferred  two  year  CCAF  degree  on  or  before PECD.  CCAF degree may be in any discipline. 1.14.  Correcting  Enlistment  Grades.  The  Skills  Management  Branch  (AFPC/DPSOA),  approves enlistment grade corrections and AFPC/DPSOE updates MilPDS accordingly. 1.15.  Correcting  Promotion  Effective  Dates  and  Dates  of  Rank  .    AFPC/DPSOE  corrects promotion effective dates as a result of promotion withhold actions and supplemental promotion selections  through  the  Case  Management  System  (CMS).  Airmen  may  be  authorized  to promotion  effective  date  corrections  for  the  following  reasons:  supplemental  promotion selection, PME withhold, EPME waivers, retainability withhold, investigation (military/civilian) withhold,  and  Primary  Air  Force  Specialty  Code  (AFSC)  Skill  Level  waivers.  Retroactive effective date corrections are not authorized: ALS academic failure, failed to complete ALS due to  disciplinary  reasons,  commander  non-recommended  retroactive  promotion  due  to  fitness failure.  AFPC/DPSOE will decide all other retroactive effective date correction requests. 1.15.1.

For ineligibility of Airmen entering commissioning programs, see paragraph 4.1. 2.  Airmen will not receive supplemental promotion consideration for any cycle for which they were ineligible under this rule.  PES code “R” will automatically expire one-day prior to PECD/SCOD (if no other PES code applies).  Airmen exceeding  Time-in-Grade  (TIG)/Time-in-Service (TIS) requirements for promotion to Amn through SrA  may be promoted  the day the ineligibility condition no longer exists.  Reference paragraph  4.2.2.3. 3.  TSgt, MSgt, and SMSgt with a retirement date effective the 1st day of the month promotion increments begin remain eligible for promotion consideration. 4.  Promotion reinstatement is not authorized and MPS changes PES to code “X” (if no other PES  code applies).  For approved withdrawal of PCS declination statement (PES code “C”), effective date is the day AFPC approves withdrawal of PCS declination statement.  For Airmen in grades SrA through SMSgt with a court martial conviction, PES code “F” expires 12 months from date  sentence is adjudged or longest period of punishment, whichever is later. Airmen in grades A1C and below with a court martial conviction, PES code “F” will apply only if punishment is imposed and will expire upon completion of the longest period of punishment.  Airmen convicted by court   martial receiving a discharge as punishment who are approved for the Return to Duty Program (RTDP) will undergo suspended court martial punishment (PES code “F”) while serving a 12- month probationary period beginning the completion date of the RTDP.  While undergoing  suspended court martial punishment, Airmen are ineligible for promotion. 5.  In cases where reenlistment denial appeals are successfully approved, or cases where court- martial/Article 15 punishment is set aside (includes suspended reduction), the PES code will revert to the original PES code unless another applies.  The MPS notifies AFPC/DPSOE via email in cases where reinstatement applies.   6.  Airmen in grades AB through A1C meeting TIG/TIS promotion requirements in paragraphs 2.1. and 2.2 can be promoted no earlier than the close out date of an EPR that is not a referral, if otherwise eligible and approved by the commander.  Airmen in grades SrA through SMSgt regain promotion eligibility for future promotion cycles only after  receiving a report that is not a referral report and closes out on or before the next PECD/SCOD,  if otherwise eligible. Reinstatement is not authorized. 7.  Commanders may request waiver of PES code “Q” for TSgts meeting all requirements for upgrade to the 7-skill level, but are awaiting attendance to 7-level school.  MPS forwards  approved waiver requests to AFPC/DPSOE. (T-3). 8.  Members who have an approved HYT extension are eligible for promotion, however, member must be able to obtain the necessary retainability associated with the promotion; if member is  unable to obtain retainability then he/she is ineligible during the promotion cycle. Promotion  eligibility reinstatement is not authorized for an Airman whose approved retirement date is wi thdrawn  or changed (this includes HYT extensions). 9.  Reinstatement of promotion eligibility is authorized if the decision to discharge is reversed  and R I 9 A 3 0 0  is removed. 10.  One year of enrollment begins when officially notified to enroll in DL. 11.

Commanders will withhold a projected promotion of an individual in the ADAPT Program  (PES Code “E”).  The Commander has the discretion to release the withhold action at any  time  and either recommend or non-recommend the Airman for promotion. 2. Commanders should consider recommendations from the Treatment Team (TT).  The  promotion authority retains final decision. 3. A commander will withhold an Airman's promotion if he or she is under investigation, or  the  subject of a military or civil criminal law inquiry (formal or informal) which may result in action under UCMJ or prosecution by civil authorities. The commander may continue to  withhold the promotion when the investigation or inquiry is complete but no AFI36-2502  12 DECEMBER 2014 19 determination has  been made as to the action the military or civil authorities will take.

For Airman Leadership School, wing commander or equivalent (Equivalent level Commander is defined as the first Senior Rater in the rating chain) is the approval and disapproval authority for EPME waivers (cannot be further delegated). They may defer EPME requirements for a maximum of 179-days for Airmen who lack EPME completion for promotion to SSgt. This waiver process does not waive any other withhold conditions. Process these requests through the chain of command (squadron commander, group commander, and wing commander) to AFPC/DPSOE who acts as the final approval authority.

They may defer EPME requirements for a maximum of 179-days for Airmen who lack EPME completion for promotion to SSgt.  This waiver process does not waive any other withhold conditions. Process these requests through the chain of command (squadron commander, group commander, and wing commander) to AFPC/DPSOE who acts as the final approval authority.  The only exception for waivers beyond 179 days is for Airmen on TDYs/deployments that exceed 179 days, on short tour locations with no EPME available, and Airmen who cannot complete required EPME before promotion due to circumstances beyond their control (i.e., retraining, medical issues, personal hardship, EFMP, etc). Commanders use Attachment 3 to request a promotion waiver for deserving Airmen who meet these scenarios.  Route these requests through AFPC/DPSOE.  If approved, AFPC/DPSOE will update MilPDS and, if required, will grant a retroactive effective date IAW paragraph 1.15. Commanders may only approve one EPME waiver per Airman; approval authority for subsequent EPME waiver requests are at the discretion of AF/A1D. (T-3).  5.  Commanders  will  withhold  an  individual’s  projected  promotion  following  a  failed  a fitness assessment after the promotion eligibility cutoff date (PECD), or after having been selected for promotion (line number). Commanders consult AFI 36-2905 for administrative options for Airmen who fail to maintain fitness standards throughout the year. Update PES Code “N” when the commander non-recommends promotion; update PES Code “Y” when the commander withholds promotion.

NOTES: 1.  These dates reflect the normal promotion cycle increment months; however, due to budget constraints or other unforeseen actions, these dates may be extended.  Anyone promoted beyond the normal cycle will be allowed to assume the higher grade effective the date his/her PSN is incremented.  The Airman’s DOR will equal the first day of the last month of the normal promotion cycle.  Those Airmen promoted beyond a normal cycle are not entitled to apply for correction of military records under the provisions of AFI 36-2604, Service Dates and Dates of Rank, to have their effective date retroactively adjusted to their DOR. AFI36-2502  12 DECEMBER 2014 21 Chapter 2 REGULAR AIR FORCE AIRMAN PROMOTIONS TO GRADES AMN THROUGH CMSGT 2.1.  Airman and A1C Promotions (see Table 1. 3) 2.1.1.  An  AB  is  eligible  for  promotion  to  Amn  at  6  months  TIG.  An  Amn  is  eligible  for promotion to A1C at 10 months TIG. 2.1.2.  Individuals initially enlisting for a period of 6 years are promoted from AB or Amn to A1C upon completion of either technical training or 20 weeks of technical training (start date of the 20 week period is the date of Basic Military Training (BMT) completion), whichever occurs first. The DOR for A1C is then adjusted to the date completed BMT without back pay and allowances. 2.1.3.  The promotion authority must recommend the promotion in writing before the Airman assumes the grade. 2.2.  SrA Promotions (see Table 1.3): 2.2.1.  Airmen (fully qualified) are promoted to SrA upon meeting minimum requirements in Table 2.1, when recommended by the promotion authority in writing, and have completed 36 months TIS and 20 months TIG or 28 months TIG (whichever occurs first). 2.2.1.1.  In  situations  where  an  RegAF  Airman  is  unable  to  obtain  their  3-skill  level before the projected promotion date and training delay was due to no fault of the Airman, the  Unit  Commander  must  ensure  retroactive  promotion  is  requested  through  the  MPS upon the Airmen obtaining their 3-skill level. (T-3). 2.3.  SrA Below-The-Zone (BTZ) Promotion Program: 2.3.1.  SrA BTZ is a one-time promotion consideration to advance to SrA 6 months prior to the  fully  qualified  phase  point  listed  in  paragraph    2.2.1  above.  Host  wing  commander  (or senior  Air  Force  officer  serving  in  that  capacity)  establishes  written  administrative procedures  for  small  units  serviced  by  their  installation,  and  may  do  so  for  large  units  if desired. Procedures must ensure all eligible Airmen receive fair, equitable, and timely BTZ consideration. Airmen must meet skill level requirements in Table 2.1. 2.3.1.1.  Commander must review EPRs, Personal  Information  Files (PIF) (if available), and  discuss  nominations  with  the  member’s  supervisors/rating  chain  prior  to  making  a nomination  decision,  regardless  if  the  Airman  is  meeting  a  large  unit  or  a  small unit/Central Base Board (CBB). 2.3.1.2.  AF Form 1206, Nomination for Award, is required for all A1Cs being nominated to  the  CBB  for  BTZ  consideration.  Note:  DBH  reports  are  no  longer  required  or authorized.  2.3.2.  Airmen are identified during the processing month and SrA BTZ promotion selections are made during the months indicated in Table 2.6.  2.3.3.  Airmen  must  be  “considered”  by  the  losing  unit  if  their  report  not  later  than  date (RNLTD) is the 1st day of the first processing month or later. 22 AFI36-2502  12 DECEMBER 2014 2.3.4.  Personnel  Systems  Management  Section  (PSM)  provides  an  automatic  quarterly  end of month (EOM) output product to the Career Enhancement Element within the first 10 days of the first processing month (i.e. Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct). The roster identifies all A1Cs who meet or exceed the TIS and TIG requirements, regardless of promotion ineligibility conditions (i.e. on the control roster, PAFSC skill level too low, undergoing Article 15 suspended reduction, etc.), and whose grade status reason (GSR) does not equal code ―5Q (previously considered for SrA BTZ). This output product automatically updates the GSR to ―5Q to prevent them from  appearing  on  future  SrA  BTZ  listings.  Remove  names  of  those  exceeding  TIG/TIS requirements. (NOTE:    A1Cs  with  GSR  “YY”  or  “ZZ”  may  not  show  on  roster.)  The output product produces an MPS alphabetical listing and a three-part unit listing: 2.3.4.1.  Part  I: Identifies A1Cs with no quality indicators in their record. 2.3.4.2.  Part  II:  Lists  “questionable  eligibles”  (individuals  with  quality  indicators)  who may not be qualified for BTZ promotion. 2.3.4.3.  Part  III:  Lists  A1Cs  who  meet  the  TIG  and  TIS  requirements,  but  cannot  be selected due to promotion ineligibility conditions listed in Table 1.1. 2.3.4.4.  Using the Military Personnel Section (MPS) listing, verify the eligibility of each individual  to  ensure  they  meet  the  TIG  and  TIS  requirements  for  the  current  quarter.  Only  verify  the  TIG  and  TIS  requirements  and  do  not  consider  normal  promotion ineligibility  conditions.    This  will  ensure  only  those  meeting  the  TIG  and  TIS requirements are considered and possibly prevent someone from being considered more than  once  for  SrA  BTZ  promotion.    Remove  any  names  of  those  who  do  not  meet  the current quarter TIG and TIS requirements and ensure the GSR 5Q is  corrected to allow the member to show up on a future roster.  Remove any names of those exceeding TIG and  TIS  requirements  and  determine  if  the  member  was  considered  during  a  previous quarter’s  board.    If  the  member  was  serviced  by  the  current  MPS,  review  the  previous quarterly  rosters.    If  not,  contact  the  previous  MPS  to  verify  if  they  were  considered  at that location.   For individuals not  considered during the quarter in  which they met TIG and TIS eligibility and are recommended by the commander, request supplemental BTZ consideration. 2.3.4.4.1.  Host wings with enough eligible students (7 or more) to earn a quota (CBB or large unit) may request an exception to policy to hold a “student only” BTZ board. Requests are forwarded through the MPS, Career Development Section, and MPS/CC for approval.  Technical  Training locations apply.  If request  is  not  approved or there are  less  than  7  eligible  technical  training  students  they  will  be  considered  at  the central base board since they contribute to the quota authorization. 2.3.4.4.2.  All  ROTC/USAFA  eliminees  who  were  given  credit  toward  their  DOR (DOR is prior to the Effective Date) are ineligible for BTZ consideration.  They are eligible for SrA after 1 year on entered active duty (EAD)and have obtained a 3-skill level. 2.3.4.4.3.  All  ROTC/USAFA  eliminees  that  were  NOT  given  credit  toward  their DOR (DOR and Effective Dates are the same) are eligible for BTZ consideration. 2.3.4.4.4.  Verify  BTZ  eligibility  of  all  A1C  departing  PCS  and  prepare  a  BTZ selection  folder  for  airmen  departing  prior  to  the  1st  processing  month  for  the  BTZ AFI36-2502  12 DECEMBER 2014 23 quarter  they  are  TIG/TIS  eligible  and  whose  RNLTD  is  the  1st  day  of  the  first processing month or later. 2.3.5.  SrA BTZ quotas are based on the total TIG and TIS eligible population listed on Parts I, II, and III of the quarterly BTZ roster. Large units (7 or more eligibles) are excluded from the eligible population  when calculating the CBB quotas.  Distribute CBB quotas based on 15  percent  of  eligibles  (eligibility  for  distribution  of  quotas  is  based  on  TIG  and  TIS  only, regardless  of  normal  ineligibility  conditions).    Obtain  host  wing  commander  approval  for CBB  quota.    Host  wing  commander  may  delegate  approval  of  quota  distribution  no  lower than the MPS Commander.  Large unit (7 or more eligibles) quotas are based on 15 percent of their unit’s eligible population. 2.3.5.1.  Units cannot aggregate above the unit level. If a unit commander (not group) is the commander having promotion authority for more than one organization, the eligibles are combined at the unit level and the unit remains a small unit or becomes a large unit (7 or more eligibles). 2.3.5.2.  In  cases where there is  a large unit (7 or more eligibles based on TIG and TIS only)  and  there  are  not  enough  eligibles  from  all  the  small  units  to  meet  the  1-quota requirement based on 15 percent of the eligible population, the large unit and small units will combine to meet at the central base board.  Do not deviate from established written procedures for these boards. 2.3.5.3.  In cases where there are no large units and there are only 2-6 eligibles from all the small units, the base is authorized to hold a central base board and allowed 1-quota. 2.3.5.4.  In  cases  where  there  are  no  large  units  and  there  is  only  1  eligible  out  of  the entire  base  population  eligibles,  the  MPS  Promotions  office  will  notify  the  MPS/CC  to determine if a board should be held.  The MPS/CC may authorize 1-quota. 2.3.6.  Large units  (7 or  more eligibles)  receive their own quotas and promote at  unit level. Unless the host wing commander establishes written procedures, commanders of large units will  establish  written  selection  procedures  that  ensure  the  SrA  BTZ  program  is  fair, equitable, and provides timely promotion consideration. Once selections are made, large unit commanders underline the selectee(s) name, sign, date, and return the BTZ eligibility listing to the MPS no later than the last day of the selection month (i.e. 31 Mar, 30 Jun, 30 Sep, 31 Dec). 2.3.7.  Small  units  (6  or  less  eligibles)  are  combined  into  one  pool  of  eligibles  to  form  the CBB population. The host wing commander will establish written BTZ selection procedures to  include  method  of  nominating,  number  of  nominations,  time  table  to  complete  required actions, board composition, areas to be considered, scoring scale, announcing selections and any  other  required actions necessary to  ensure the SrA  BTZ program  is  fair, equitable, and provides  timely  promotion  consideration.  The  MPS,  Career  Development  Section,  will ensure they have received all nomination packages from units with eligibles; if a unit is not going to nominate, ensure negative reply is received. 2.4.  Central Base Board (CBB) Process. 2.4.1.  Units will consider all individuals meeting TIS and TIG requirements, even if they are TDY, on leave, have PCA'd, or have a report not later than date (RNLTD) on or after the first 24 AFI36-2502  12 DECEMBER 2014 day of the first processing month (i.e., Jan, Apr, Jul, and Oct) for that quarter selections.  All individuals  appearing  on  the  eligibility  listing  must  be  “considered”;  as  stated  earlier,  this means that the commander must review any EPR(s) the Airman may have, PIF, discuss the consideration  with  the  supervisor  and  chain  of  command,  etc.,  before  making  a  BTZ recommendation.    The  MPS  will  verify  BTZ  eligibility  of  A1Cs  departing  PCS  (determine the quarter the individual is BTZ eligible) and ensure a BTZ selection folder is prepared prior to PCS departure.  MPS Career Development Section must coordinate on the AF Form 907, Relocation  Preparation  Checklist,  for  all  A1Cs  departing  PCS.    When  a  selection  folder  is not prepared prior to an individual’s PCS departure, the gaining MPS must make every effort to obtain a copy of the individual’s AF Form 1206 and decoration citations by contacting the losing MPS. 2.4.1.1.  Adjustments  will  not  be  made  to  the  gaining  unit/base  quota  if  the  error  is discovered  and  an  individual  should  have  been  considered  by  their  losing  base.    Every effort should be made to ensure the individual is considered by their losing unit/base.  If the losing unit/base has  already  announced selections, supplemental  consideration (with current commander recommendation) should be requested by the gaining base. 2.4.2.  The host wing commander will establish board procedures for the CBB (see paragraph 2.3.1 and 2.3.7). (T-3) 2.4.2.1.  Host  wing  commander  may  require  all  units  under  their  command  (not  tenant units)  to  nominate  to  the  CBB.  Tenant  units  remain  large  units  unless  host  wing commander allows them to compete at the CBB. 2.4.2.2.  Commanders  must  review  any  EPR(s)  the  Airman  may  have,  his/her  Personal Information  File  (PIF)  if  available,  and  discuss  nominations  with  the  member’s supervisors/rating chain prior to making a nomination decision. 2.4.2.3.  AF  Form  1206  is  required  for  all  A1Cs  being  nominated  to  the  CBB  for  BTZ consideration. Note: DBH reports are no longer required or authorized.  2.4.2.4.  After  CBB  convenes,  a  board  report  will  be  accomplished.    The  board  report should contain a list of board members, board recorder, order of merit (identifying total score and select/nonselect status), and cutoff score.  The report should be signed by the board  president  and  board  recorder,  and  approved  by  the  host  wing  commander,  unless the host wing commander is the board president; then only one signature is necessary. 2.4.3.  If  an  Airman  was  not  considered  during  their  eligibility  time  frame  and  the  error  is discovered  before  BTZ  selections  are  announced,  large  unit  commander  will  consider  the Airman  and  adjust  selections  accordingly.    The  CBB  will  reconvene  to  consider  small  unit eligibles  and  selections  are  adjusted  accordingly.    If  the  error  is  discovered  after  selections are announced, request supplemental BTZ consideration IAW paragraph 2.5. 2.4.4.  Alternates may be selected in the event a selectee is removed before the effective date. SrA BTZ promotions cannot be placed in withhold. Projected promotions must be removed for any quality indicators listed in  Table  1.1 (including under investigation).  If extenuating circumstances  exist,  request  reinstatement  in  accordance  with  paragraph    4.3.    If  the  first alternate's SrA BTZ DOR has already passed, they will receive the original BTZ DOR and an effective  date  of  unit  commander  approval.  MPS  assists  the  airman  in  applying  for  a retroactive promotion effective date according to paragraph 1.15. AFI36-2502  12 DECEMBER 2014 25 2.4.5.  After  selections  are  made,  unit  commanders  provide  a  written  promotion recommendation prior to the promotion effective date. 2.4.6.  Update  SrA  BTZ  promotions  immediately  upon  receipt  of  selections  in  MILPDS  in accordance with Enlisted Promotions PSD Guide. 2.5.  Supplemental BTZ Consideration. 2.5.1.  Unit  Commanders may request  supplemental BTZ consideration for individuals who should have been considered by a previous board and the error was not discovered until after selections are announced or promotions are updated. Unit commanders provide justification for members not receiving a fair consideration and forwards fully documented supplemental request to the MPS for consideration. 2.5.2.  Supplemental consideration will not be given for the following reasons: 2.5.2.1.  Incorrect data reflected on the BTZ RIP. 2.5.2.2.  Denied  BTZ  nomination  due  to  incorrect  data  reflected  on  the  BTZ  output products or in the ARMS record. 2.5.2.3.  BTZ  eligibility  listing  not  returned  to  the  MPS  or  individuals  were  overlooked on the listing. 2.5.2.4.  Nomination packages or decoration not completed/turned in/approved in time to meet the board. 2.5.3.  Supplemental  BTZ  nominees  receive  an  extra  quota  for  themselves,  ONLY.      If supplemental  nominee  is  not  selected,  the  extra  quota  goes  away.    DO  NOT  give  the  extra quota to other nominees. 2.5.4.  Supplemental BTZ must be requested and approved prior to the next convening BTZ board.    The  supplemental  nominee  will  be  considered  along  with  the  other  eligibles  in  the next quarter. 2.6.  SSgt, TSgt, and MSgt Promotions (see Table 1.  3).  Airmen compete and test under the Weighted Airmen Promotion System (WAPS) in the Control Air Force Specialty Code (CAFSC) held on the PECD.  Table 2.2 outlines WAPS factors and formulas. 2.6.1.  AFPC/DPSOE  : 2.6.1.1.  Makes promotion selections using WAPS (promotion file) and data in MilPDS. Only EPRs received during each grade’s period of promotion eligibility (maximum of 3 Force  Distributed  reports)  are  used  to  compute  the  EPR  weighted  factor  score.    All eligibles are required to have an EPR that closes out within one year of the PECD on file to  compete  for  promotion.    If  a  member  does  not  have  an  EPR  on  file,  they  cannot  be considered  for  promotion  until  their  EPR  closes  out.    At  that  time,  the  member  will  be considered supplementally. 2.6.1.2.  Considers Airmen automatically eligible (see Table 2.3, Rule 3, Note 4) if they are in a retraining status without a PAFSC skill level (Table 2.3.) in their current grade. 2.6.1.3.  Applies the quota to each promotion Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC), with the highest scores in each AFSC selected. (T-0) 26 AFI36-2502  12 DECEMBER 2014 2.6.1.4.  Promotes Airmen in  chronic critical  shortage (CCS) skills  at  a higher selection rate  than  those  of  non-CCS  skills.    AF/A1  approves  and  provides  promotion  allocation rates to AFPC/DPSOE for each promotion AFSC based on A1P promotion analysis and CCS skills review prior to each promotion cycle. (T-1). 2.6.1.5.  Considers  Airmen  with  SKT  exemptions  in  one  of  two  promotion  AFSCs (00XXX  CCS  or  00XXX  for  non-CCS).  (See  Table  2.4,  Note  1.)    EXCEPTION:  Retrainees in AFSCs without SKTs compete along with all other Airmen in that AFSC. 2.6.1.5.1.  After  serving  in  an  awarded  AFSC  for  at  least  1  year,  Airmen  are  SKT- Exempt  for  24  months  if  they  are  determined  as  not  fully  qualified  (SrA  =  5 level/SSgt  = 7 level) upon return to  their previously awarded AFSC. Update a Date Initially Entered Retraining (DIERT) to the date the Airman returned to the previous AFSC. For periods of less than 1 year, ensure the Airman takes the SKT (if AFSC has SKT for particular cycle). 2.6.1.6.  Accomplishes  an  order  of  merit  list  in  each  promotion  AFSC  from  the  highest score  to  lowest  score  and  applies  the  promotion  quota.    Selects  all  Airmen  with  tied scores at the cutoff for their AFSC.  (T-0) 2.6.1.7.  Conducts  data  verification  on  selects  NLT  10  days  after  virtual  promotion release and notifies MPS when errors are identified.   (T-0) 2.6.2.  The MPS: 2.6.2.1.  Instructs  eligible  Airmen  to  review  their  records  in  PRDA,  and  obtain/review their  DVR/score  notices  on  vMPF  to  verify  the  data  used  in  the  promotion  selection process.  (T-3) 2.6.2.2.  Schedules and tests Airmen using the CAFSC held on the PECD.  IAW AFI 36-2605, Air Force Military Personnel Testing Program, Attachment 9, Airmen who fail to show for scheduled promotion testing without a valid reason are ineligible for promotion consideration  during  that  particular  promotion  cycle  (Table  1.1,  Rule  9).    Ensure  the Airman  signs  a  statement  in  accordance  with  paragraph    1.11,  or  the  AF  Form  1566, WAPS Test Verification, used to administer tests, to document declination.  (T-3) 2.6.2.3.  Notifies  Airmen  in  writing  when  a  data  error  is  found  during  data  verification that  could  result  in  nonselection,  and  directs  individuals  to  not  assume  the  new  grade until AFPC/DPSOE confirms the selection status.   (T-3) 2.6.2.4.  Monitors  and  resolves  non-weighable/“data  errors”  before  testing  window begins as outlined in this AFI and supplementary program guidance published on myPers and in the latest Personnel Services Delivery (PSD) Guide. 2.6.3.  Unit Commanders: 2.6.3.1.  Advise  selects AFPC/DPSOE as outlined in paragraph  2.6.1.7.  (T-3) that  promotions  are tentative  pending  verification  by 2.6.3.2.

Test for promotion as outlined in AFI 36-2605.  Failure to report for scheduled testing  (which  includes  both  tests,  if  applicable)  renders  an  Airman  ineligible  for promotion  consideration  unless  rescheduling is  approved.  A  second  no-show automatically renders an Airman ineligible for promotion. 2.6.5.  Airman  prepares  for  promotion  testing  (includes  obtaining  testing  material,  knowing testing  window  and  date,  knowing  promotion  AFSC),  which  is  solely  an  individual responsibility  and  should  not  be  considered  an  item  for  enlisted  professional  development.  Group study in any forum or format is prohibited. 2.6.6.  Airman retrieves his/her WAPS score notice after promotions are announced.  WAPS score notices are a means to give Airmen a report of their relative standing in the promotion consideration  process  and  must  never  be  provided  to,  or  used  by,  anyone  other  than  the individual  and  his/her  commander.    Commanders  may  request  an  airman’s  scores  from  the airman  or  the  MPS.    Commanders  must  restrict  their  use  of  the  scores  to  notification  and advisory  counseling  on  the  airman’s  behalf  and  must  not  allow  further  dissemination  of scores or their use for purposes other than advisory counseling. 2.7.  MSgt  Promotions:  TSgts  eligible  for  promotion  to  MSgt  compete  and  test  under  the WAPS in the CAFSC held on the PECD. Individuals with a reporting identifier (RI) or special duty  identifier  (SDI)  designated  as  their  CAFSC  on  the  PECD  will  compete  within  that  RI  or SDI.    Consideration  for  promotion  to  the  grade  MSgt  is  comprised  of  a  two-part  process consisting of WAPS factors and a central evaluation board.  See Table 2.7 for WAPS factors and formulas. 2.7.1.  AF/A1: 2.7.1.1.

In  such  cases,  Airmen  become  selects  without supplemental board evaluation. 2.8.4.3.  Those  personnel  requiring  a  board  score  greater  than  the  maximum  allowable board score (450 points) will not be granted supplemental promotion consideration. 2.8.5.  The MPS: 2.8.5.1.  Schedules  and  tests  Airmen  using  the  CAFSC  held  on  the  PECD  to  determine test  requirements.  Airmen  who  fail  to  show  for  scheduled  promotion  testing  without  a 32 AFI36-2502  12 DECEMBER 2014 valid  reason  may  be  ineligible  for  promotion  consideration  during  that  particular promotion cycle (Table 1.1, Rule 9) IAW AFI 36-2605. MPSs notify AFPC/DPSOE by message  of  Airmen  who  already  tested,  but  later  desire  to  decline  promotion consideration. Ensures the Airman signs a statement in  accordance with paragraph 1.11 or the AF Form 1566 used to administer tests to document their declination. (T-3). 2.8.5.2.  Notifies unit commanders of each eligible individual's promotion status. (T-3). 2.8.5.3.  Instructs Airmen to review their record in PRDA, obtain and review their DVR along  with  their  score  notice  on  the  vMPF  to  verify  the  data  used  in  the  promotion process. (T-3). 2.8.6.  Airmen: 2.8.6.1.  Must meet the eligibility criteria outlined in paragraph 2.6.4, Table 2.1, Rules 5 & 6 and have an EPR closing out within the last 12 months prior to the PECD. 2.8.6.2.  Obtain and review DVRs along with score notices on the vMPF, review PRDA selection folder to  ensure data is  correct,  and notify the appropriate MPS workcenter or agency for correction of any errors. 2.8.6.3.  The MPS: 2.8.6.3.1.  Ensures selects assigned a .9 PSN obtain the required 2 years retainability for promotion to  MSgt  or SMSgt,  and 3  years retainability for promotion to  CMSgt from effective date of promotion, and may apply for a change to their ETS once the retroactive effective date is processed.  (T-3) 2.8.6.3.2.  Instructs  commanders to  make  a written promotion recommendation.  (T-3) 2.8.6.4.  The Unit Commander: 2.8.6.4.1.  Instructs selects with a .9 PSN that they are not to assume the higher grade until they obtain retainability (if required).  (T-3) 2.8.6.4.2.  Notifies selects with  a .9 PSN they may  assume the next  higher  grade on the  date  of  written  approval,  if  data  verification  is  complete  and  they  have  required retainability.  (T-3) 2.8.6.4.3.  AFPC/DPSOE will grant a retroactive effective date correction to match an Airman’s DOR in accordance with paragraph  1.14. 2.9.  Supplemental Promotions for SSgt Through CMSgt.  AFPC/DPSOE conducts in-system supplemental  promotion  consideration  monthly  after  initial  promotion  selection  and  announces supplemental  selection  board  dates  for  eligible  Airmen.    See  paragraph  1.15  for  DOR  and effective date corrections.  Supplemental promotion consideration will not be granted if the error or omission appeared on/in the Airman’s DVR, PRDA/ARMS record, or senior NCO selection folder  and  no  corrective  or  follow-up  action  was  taken  by  the  Airman  prior  to  the  promotion selection date for SSgt through TSgt and prior to the original evaluation board for MSgt through CMSgt.  Fully documented supplemental consideration requests will be submitted in writing, to include  the  Airman’s  unit  commander’s  recommendation  to  the  MPS.    MPSs  will  review  and forward requests to AFPC/DPSOE via CMS.  (T-3). AFI36-2502  12 DECEMBER 2014 33 2.9.1.  If an Airman missed one or more testing cycles (due to deployment or hospitalization, etc.),  he/she  is  considered  retroactively.  This  is  done  using  scores  from  the  first  available WAPS tests upon return. If selected for previous cycles, the Airman will receive a retroactive date of rank and back pay. 2.9.1.1.  Airmen  must  complete  Airman  Leadership  School  before  being  considered  for STEP  promotion  to  SSgt,  or  the  resident  NCO  Academy  before  being  considered  for STEP promotion to MSgt (this requirement cannot be waived). 2.9.1.2.  A  minimum  of  12  months  TIG  is  required  for  STEP  promotion  to  TSgt  and MSgt; promotions to SSgt must have a minimum of 6 months TIG. 2.9.1.3.  Commanders may waive other promotion eligibility requirements in  Table 2.1. (T-3) 2.9.2.  A separate written request is not required when an individual has indicated his or her desire to  apply for supplemental  consideration in  conjunction  with  the EPR appeal  process. NOTE: Ensure Blocks 9 and 10, on the AF Form 948, Application for Correction/Removal of Evaluation Reports, are completed. 2.9.3.  Supplemental promotion may be granted for those individuals who are recommended by their unit commander and are non-weighable, had a change to the weighted data elements (see  Table  2.2.)  (must  be  effective  prior  to  PECD),  or  had  wrong  or  missing  data  for  a specific cycle. 2.9.3.1.  A supplemental request based on a missing decoration must have a closeout date on or before PECD, and the commander’s recommendation date on the DECOR 6 must be  before  the  date  AFPC  makes  the  selections  for  promotion.  Resubmit  decorations (downgraded,  lost,  amended,  etc.),  to  verify  the  original  submission  was  placed  into official channels prior to the selection date. 2.9.3.1.1.  If the date of  the special  order is  prior to  the month promotion selections are made, the decoration will automatically update the promotion master file. 2.9.3.1.2.  If  the  date  of  the  special  order  is  the  month  selections  are  made  or  later, send  the  following  documents  to  AFPC/DPSOE:  Written  request  with  unit commander’s  recommendation,  citation,  DECOR  6  (both  pages),  amendments  (if any), documentation verifying when decoration was placed into official channels, and documentation of corrective/follow-up action taken by the Airman. 2.9.3.2.  AFPC  considers  MAJCOMs,  FOAs,  and  DRUs  without  a  quota  (less  than  300 SrA through TSgt) and announces procedures via annual STEP message. (T-0) 2.9.3.3.  Updates all STEP promotions into MilPDS.  The effective date and DOR are the date the selection authority announces the selections.  (T-0) 2.9.4.  MSgt  thru  CMSgt  Supplemental  Procedures:    There  are  no  automatic  approvals  for supplemental  promotion  consideration.    Table  2.5  is  used  to  determine  whether  or  not  a request  for  supplemental  promotion  consideration  is  authorized,  and  if  so,  whether  or  not mandatory  scoring  is  required.    Final  decisions  for  approval  of  supplemental  consideration requests rest with the AFBCMR or AFPC/DPSOE. 34 AFI36-2502  12 DECEMBER 2014 2.9.4.1.  TSgt,  MSgts,  and  SMSgt  meeting  one  of  the  reasons  in  Table  2.5  may  be considered supplementally.  These individuals will receive supplemental selection board consideration, if approved in accordance with Chapter 3. 2.9.4.2.  Supplemental board consideration is not provided when corrected data increases an Airman’s weighted factor score so that the total revised promotion score is at or above the  cutoff  needed  for  selection.  In  such  cases,  Airmen  become  selects  without supplemental board evaluation. 2.9.4.3.  Those  personnel  requiring  a  board  score  greater  than  the  maximum  allowable board score (450 points) will not be granted supplemental promotion consideration. 2.9.5.  Score  notices  are  not  provided  for  Airmen  who  receive  supplemental  board consideration to MSgt, SMSgt, and CMSgt, unless they were not considered by the original board.  Weighted scores only are provided (not a board score). 2.9.6.  Supplemental Processing Instructions: 2.9.6.1.  Individuals  supplementally  selected  for  promotion  to  grades  SSgt  through CMSgt  receive  PSNs  of  .9  (on  increments  previously  announced)  or  .5  (unannounced future increment). 2.9.6.2.  Individuals  selected  and  assigned  a  .9  PSN  are  automatically  projected  for promotion the first day of the month following the month they were considered/selected in.  This  is  to  ensure  data  verification  is  completed  and  the  commander  recommends promotion prior to the promotion automatically consummating. 2.9.6.3.  The MPS: 2.9.6.3.1.  Ensures selects assigned a .9 PSN obtain the required 2 years retainability for promotion to  MSgt  or SMSgt,  and 3  years retainability for promotion to  CMSgt from effective date of promotion, and may apply for a  change to their ETS once the retroactive effective date is processed. (T-3). 2.9.6.3.2.  Instructs  commanders  to  make  a  written  promotion  recommendation.  (T-3). 2.9.6.4.  The Unit Commander: 2.9.6.4.1.  Instructs selects with a .9 PSN that they are not to assume the higher grade until they obtain retainability (if required). (T-3). 2.9.6.4.2.  Notifies selects with  a .9 PSN they may  assume the next  higher  grade on the  date  of  written  approval,  if  data  verification  is  complete  and  they  have  required retainability. (T-3). 2.9.6.4.3.  AFPC/DPSOE will grant a retroactive effective date correction to match an Airman’s DOR in accordance with paragraph  1.15. 2.10.  Promoting  Under  Stripes  for  Exceptional  Performers  (STEP).  This  program supplements  existing  Airman  Promotion  programs  and  is  designed  to  accommodate  unique circumstances that, in  the commander’s judgment,  clearly warrant  promotion.   It  is  intended to provide a means to promote Airmen for compelling, although perhaps not quantifiable, reasons.  Isolated  heroic  acts  or  specific  achievements  should  not  be  the  sole  basis  for  promotion  under AFI36-2502  12 DECEMBER 2014 35 this  program.  STEP  promotions  are  authorized  to  grades  SSgt  and  TSgt.    Airmen  are  not supplementally considered for STEP.  DOR and effective date are the date the selection authority announces the promotion. 2.10.1.1.  Airmen must complete Airman Leadership School before being considered for STEP promotion to SSgt (this requirement cannot be waived). 2.10.1.2.  A  minimum  of  12  months  TIG  is  required  for  STEP  promotion  to  TSgt  and promotions to SSgt must have a minimum of 6 months TIG. 2.10.2.  Selections  will  be  based  on  recommendations  from  subordinate  commanders  or personal  knowledge  of  the  individual.    Time  consuming  administrative  boards  are discouraged. 2.10.3.  AFPC/DPSOE: 2.10.3.1.  Distributes STEP quotas to MAJCOMS, FOAs, DRUs and Air Force Elements with 575 or more SrA and SSgts assigned.  (T-1). 2.10.3.2.  AFPC considers MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs without a quota (less than 575 SrA through SSgt) and announces procedures via annual STEP message. (T-1). 2.10.3.3.  Updates all STEP promotions into MilPDS. The effective date and DOR are the date the selection authority announces the selections. (T-0). 2.10.4.  The MPS: 2.10.4.1.  Completes  P-series  orders  and  notifies  AFPC/DPSOE  by  message  of  STEP selections  within  72  hours.  Include  name,  SSN,  grade  promoted  to,  effective  date, CAFSC, assignment unit, special order number, and date. (T-3). Table 2.1.  Minimum Eligibility Requirements for Promotion (See Note 1). R U L E If promotion  is to the grade of (see note 2) and the PAFSC as of PECD is at the and the TAFMD is on the first  day of the last month of  the promotion cycle (see note 3) and time in current grade is computed  on the first  day of the  month before the month promotions are made and the Airman has then and following mandatory education is  complete (see note 9) 1  SrA (see para.  2.2.) 3 level (see  note 4) not applicable (see para. 2.2.1. for requirements) 1 year (see para. 2.2.1. for TIG/TIS requirements)  See note 9 the Airman is eligible for promotion if recommended in writing, by the promotion 36 2  SSgt (see T a b l e  2 . 3 a n d  para. 2.6 and  notes 5, 6) 5 level (see  note 5) 3  TSgt (see para.  2.6.) 4  MSgt (see para.  2.6.) 7 level (see note 5) 7 level AFI36-2502  12 DECEMBER 2014 6 months 3 years See note 9 23 months 5 years See note 9 24 months 8 years  See note 9 authority.

Use this table to determine standard minimum eligibility requirements for promotion consideration.  HQ USAF may announce additional eligibility requirements.    The individual must serve on enlisted AD and must have been on a continuous active duty as of PECD. (T-0) 2.  The high year of tenure (HYT) policy applicable as of PECD may affect promotion eligibility in  grades SrA and above.  (T-0). 3.  Use years of satisfactory service for retirement in place of TAFMSD to determine promotion eligibility for Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve Airmen ordered to extended active duty (EAD). Exception:  Active Guard Reserve (AGR or Statutory tours).  Reserve or Guard Airmen are eligible for  promotion if EAD is on or after PECD.  (T-0). 4.  A1Cs must meet skill-level requirements by the effective date of promotion for SrA.  However,  an A1C in lengthy tech school training, or in a hardship situation, who doesn’t possess the  minimum required PAFSC can be granted a skill level waiver (SLW) to pin on SrA.  The technical  training squadron commander or for Airmen in a hardship/medical situation, the unit commander  may submit a request for SLW stating the extenuating circumstances (i.e., awaiting training,  medical delays, etc.) to AFPC/DPSOE.  (T-0). 5.  SrA must meet skill-level requirements by the PECD for SSgt, except for those individuals in PES “Q.”    SSgts test and compete for promotion to TSgt if they have a 5-skill level as of PECD; however, they must have a 7-skill level before promotion.    Commanders may waive the 7-skill 7-level school.  TSgts without the appropriate skill level are ineligible to test unless they have a valid DIERT date.  MSgts and SMSgt must meet minimum skill-level requirements listed above. MSgt and SMSgt skill levels may be waived according to Table 2.3. to allow them to compete for promotion.  Demote Airmen promoted with a PAFSC waiver who fail to obtain or maintain grade skill relationship as outlined in Chapter 6.  (T-0). 6.  Airmen demoted to SrA, SSgt, or TSgt will not have their HYT adjusted to make them eligible to  compete for promotion.  Airmen who are demoted past their HYT for that grade will not be afforded an opportunity to promotion test.  If demoted, an Airman’s HYT will be established in accordance with AFI 36-3208.  (T-0). 7.  Service in a commissioned, warrant, or flight officer status is creditable for pay but it cannot be utilized to satisfy the TEMSD requirement (38 Comptroller General 598).  Airmen may be considered for  promotions who meet this requirement on the 1st day of the last month promotions are normally  made in the cycle.  Actual promotion does not occur earlier than the 1st day of the month following  the month the Airman completes the required enlisted service.    This applies if the select had a  sequence number in an earlier promotion increment; however, if the Airman meets the required  enlisted service on the first day of the month, the DOR and effective date is that date.  (T-0). 8.  If a TDY student meets the requirements of this table, but does not maintain satisfactory proficiency, the MPS that services the Airman's TDY unit informs the MPS servicing the Airman's unit of assignment.  (T-3). 9.  To satisfy promotion eligibility requirements, EPME will be completed by in-residence for promotion to SSgt and by correspondence for promotion to SMSgt.  All PME may be  completed in-residence or by correspondence.  If selected, the projected promotion will be placed into withhold, if the 12-month EPMPE enrollment expires before the promotion sequence number (PSN) consummates.  The PSN will be removed if EPMPE is not completed by the end of the promotion cycle (T-0). 10.  Completion of the United States Army Sergeants Major Academy, the United States Navy 38 AFI36-2502  12 DECEMBER 2014 Senior Enlisted Academy, the United States Coast Guard Chief Petty Officers Academy, United States Marine Corps Staff NCO Academy, or approved comparable international courses are equivalent to SNCOA.  (T-0). 11.  The CCAF degree can be in any discipline.  Degree must be conferred (awarded) by CCAF on or before the promotion eligibility cut-off date.  (T-0).  Table 2.2.

Award 0.05416667 points for each month of TAFMS up to 20 years, as of the last day of the last month of the promotion cycle. Example:  The last day of the last month of the cycle (31 Jul 03 minus TAFMS date (18 Jul 96) equals 7 years 14 days (inclusive dates considered equals 7 x 0.05416667 = 0.37 points). (note 1) 20 points. Award 0.16667 point for each month in grade up to 10 years, as of the first day of the last month of the promotion cycle (count 15 days or more as 0.16667 point; drop periods less than 15 days). Example: The first day of the last month of the promotion cycle (1 Jul 03) minus current DOR (1 Jan 00) equals 3 years 6 months 1 day (inclusive dates considered) equals 42 x .0.16667 = 7.00 points.

Multiply  each  EPR’s  point  value  (note  4),  preceding  the PECD, not to exceed the last three Force Distributed EPRs in the Airman’s current grade, by the time-weighted factor for that specific report.  When the  maximum  three  Force  Distributed  EPRs  are  calculated  the  time weighted factors begins with 50 percent (.50) for the most recent report, 30 percent  (.30) for the middle or second most recent  report, and 20 percent (.20)  for  the  bottom  report  (50%  -  30%  -20%).  After  calculating  each report, add the total weighted point value of each report for a sum.  When an  Airman  is  in  his/her  second  year  of  eligibility,  and/or  when  only  two reports  are  calculated,  the  time  weighted  factor  begins  with  60  percent (.60) for the top or most recent report and 40 percent (.40) for the bottom report (60% - 40%). When an Airman is in his/her first year of promotion eligibility  and/or  when  only  one  EPR  is  calculated,  the  time  weighted factor is 100 percent.

The  decoration  closeout  date  must  be  on  or  before  the  PECD.    The  signed  date  by  the higher official endorsing the recommendation on the DECOR 6 must be before the date HQ AFPC  announced  the  selections  for  promotion.    Fully  document  resubmitted  decorations (downgraded,  lost,  etc.)  and  verify  they  were  placed  into  official  channels  before  the selection date.  (T-0). 4.  Promote Now = 250, Must Promote = 220, Promote = 200, Not Ready Now – 150,  Do Not Promote = 50.  (T-0). 5.  Only count evaluations received during each grade’s period of promotion eligibility. Do not count non-evaluated periods of performance, such as break in service, report removed through appeal process, etc., in the computation.  However, if one of the last three Force Distributed EPR ratings have been removed or reflects a nonrated period, and the Airman is on a third or subsequent eligibility the fourth EPR, if a Force Distributed report will become the third EPR in the last three reports used in the weighted calculation score.

Authorized (see note 2).  Notes: 1.    Do  not  allow  prior  service  enlistees  and  former  officers  skill  level  waivers  except  as indicated in paragraph 7.3.   (T-0). 2.    Process  PAFSC  skill-level  waivers  as  outlined  in  this  AFI  and  supplementary program guidance published on myPers and in the latest Personnel Services Delivery Guide. (T-3). 3.    Airmen  in  these  RIs  (except  for  RI  9S100)  as  of  the  PECD  must  meet  skill  levels established by the Air Force  Technical Applications Center (AFTAC).  Airmen who fail to meet  the  requirements  imposed  by  the  unit  commander  are  ineligible  for  a  skill-level waiver.  Airmen  with  these  RIs  as  their  PAFSC must meet the  skill-level  criteria indicated on the certificate from  AFTAC.  An Airman m u s t  have the certificate before promotion to MSgt.  (T-3). 4.    Since  the  majority  of  Airmen  are  in  a  retraining  status  (SSgt  through  MSgt)  and promotion  to  SMSgt  and  CMSgt  are  routinely  approved  for  a  PAFSC  skill-level  waiver, the  promotion  record  is  built  as  "eligible"  during  the  promotion  file  build.    The promotion  authority may  still deny the  Airman promotion consideration by disapproving a PAFSC skill-level waiver.  (T-3).     5.  Normally, do not  permit Airmen in  normal upgrade training a skill-level waiver.  Grant PAFSC  skill  level-waivers  before  PECD  for  significant  documented  interruptions  (beyond the Airman’s control) in current training that prevents the Air Airman from upgrading. (T-3).

Consider Airmen who are SKT exempt for promotion in one of two promotion AFSCs, one for non-chronic critical skills (non-CCS) and another for CCS.  When there is not an SKT for the specialty, then all Airmen in that AFSC compete for promotion together, regardless of their training status (i.e., retrainees, etc.).  All Airmen who are SKT exempt and are in an AFSC where an SKT exists can take the SKT by signing a statement.  Once signed, do not reverse the decision without unit commander and MPS commander concurrence.  Once the promotion test is administered, do not reverse the decision.  Refer to TCO memorandums for other SKT exemptions.   2. Airmen must fulfill PAFSC skill-level requirements according to Table 2.3.   3. Allow Airmen who return to a previously awarded AFSC for which they are not assigned within the last year and do not have the required skill level (SrA = 5 level, SSgt = 7 level, & TSgt = 7 level) a 24-month SKT exemption.  Update a DIERT date equal to the date the Airman returned to the previous AFSC.  Approve a PAFSC skill-level waiver according to Table 2.3.   4. Allow SKT exemptions for 24 months regardless of training status.  Airmen can elect to take the SKT by signing a statement.  Do not reverse the Airman's decision to take, or not to take, the SKT without unit commander and MPS commander concurrence.  Do not reverse the decision once the promotion test is administered.  5. MPS updates MilPDS Training Status Code (TSC) "I" with a Date Initially Entered Retraining (DIERT) equal to the date of return into the previous awarded AFSC (ref AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel [Officers and Enlisted]) if within 6 months of PECD.  Airmen may elect to take the SKT.  Do not place prior service Airmen or former officers in TSC "I". Table 2.5.

PME was last used for CMSgt during cycle 94E9 and for SMSgt during cycle 96E8.  3.  Mandatory scoring eliminates the need for optional review; the record goes directly to a supplemental panel to score the record.    4.  Prior to rescoring the record, the panel considers the type of error, the degree of impact on the promotion score, and the number of points needed for selection.  Those records the panel considers but chooses not to rescore are rendered nonselects.  Table 2.6.

This  chapter  provides  guidance  and  outlines  operating  procedures  to  be  used  in the administration and conduct of RegAF central senior noncommissioned officer evaluation and supplemental  boards  for  the  United  States  Air  Force  at  AFPC,  USAF  Selection  Board Secretariat.  Selection  Board  Secretariat  personnel  are  responsible  for  conducting  central evaluation and supplemental boards for promotions to Master Sergeant, Senior Master Sergeant, and Chief Master Sergeants on the active duty list. 3.2.  Responsibilities.  Board  members  and  alternate  board  members  should  familiarize themselves with applicable portions of this instruction.  Board members will be provided a link to  the  site  that  contains  this  AFI  in  their  board  member  notification  letter.    Alternate  board members will remain on stand-by for the duration of the board. 3.3.  Board  Membership.  Board  membership  will  reflect  the  eligible  population  in  terms  of minority and gender, MAJCOM of assignment, and career area. Career areas, when practical, are broken into four categories: Support, Operations, Maintenance, and Medical.  The largest AFSCs within each career area garner a board member when practical. 3.4.  Board  Organization  .    Boards  will  be  constructed  with  a  Board  President  (at  least  a Brigadier  General)  and  at  least  one  panel.  Panels  will  consist  of  one  colonel  (current  or “graduated”  group  commander,  when  practical)  and  two  chief  master  sergeants  from  the  same career area (defined in paragraph  3.3.).  AFSCs and CEM codes will be scored by panels with representatives from the AFSCs or CEM codes under consideration or from the same career area as those being evaluated.  All members of an AFSC or CEM code will be evaluated by the same three board members. 3.5.  Board  Member  Preparation.  The  Selection  Board  Secretariat  will  pre-brief  the  Board President  (BP)  on  the  board  agenda,  Formal  Charge,  BP  responsibilities,  and  the  trial  run exercise  (practice  scoring  session).    Board  recorders  will  conduct  the  first  day  administrative briefing to the board.  The BP will then read the Formal Charge verbatim to the board and a copy will be provided to  each board member.  Each board member will initial  a copy of the Formal Charge to be maintained in the permanent record.  Oaths are administered to board members and to  the  recorders  and  administrative  staff.    A  trial  run  exercise  will  then  be  conducted  to familiarize  board  members  with  the  selection  board  records  and  situations  the  board  may encounter during actual scoring 3.6.  Scoring  Records.  Board  scores  are  based  upon in  each  eligible’s Noncommissioned  Officer  Selection  Record  (NSR).  Board  members  will  not  have  access  to objective  WAPS  data  to  include  United  States  Air  Force  Supervisory  Examination  (USAFSE) scores. the  material 3.6.1.  Board  members  will  assign  each  eligible  member  a  board  score  reflecting  their assessment of relative leadership potential. Select/Non-Select decisions are made based upon the totality of the eligible’s scores in WAPS, not just their board score. (See Table 2.2 and Table 2.7). AFI36-2502  12 DECEMBER 2014 49 3.6.2.  Scoring  is  by  secret  ballot  and  without  benefit  of  discussion,  unless  a  significant disagreement (a "split") occurs in the scores on a particular record. 3.6.2.1.  If  a  board  member  identifies  a  record-based  matter  that  causes  concern,  he/she will surface the matter to the board recorder who will discuss it with the BP. The BP may approve bringing that matter to the attention of the board members. Such records may be rescored after discussion. 3.6.2.2.  Board members may discuss their own personal knowledge and evaluation of the professional  qualifications  of  eligible  Airmen  as  long  as  they  discuss  only  matters documented in the NSR. 3.6.2.3.  Board  members  may  not  discuss  or  disclose  the  opinion  of  any  person  not  a member of the board concerning the member. Figure 3.1.  Scoring Scale.  Boards will use the following scale Score 10.0 9.5 9.0 8.5 8.0 7.5 7.0 6.5 6.0 Potential Absolutely superior Outstanding Few could be better Strong Slightly above average Average Slightly below average Well below average Lowest 3.7.  Defining  "Splits".  A  "split"  is  a  significant  disagreement  between  board  members  about the score of a record. A "split" is considered a difference in a score of 1.5 or more points between any two panel members (e.g., 6 and 7.5, or 8 and 9.5). 3.8.  Resolving  "Splits".  All  scoring  stops  and  all  voting  panel  members  must  be  present  and may discuss the records involved in a "split."  Only panel members with split scores may change their scores in the process of resolving a split. A "split" is resolved when there is a difference in a score of 1.0 or less points between any two panel members (e.g., 6 and 7.0, or 8 and 8.5). 3.9.  New  Documents.  If  new  information  (e.g.,  decoration  citation,  enlisted  performance report, updated SNCO evaluation brief) concerning individual records is acquired during scoring, the affected records will be brought back to the panel for rescoring.  New documents will not be accepted after the panel has adjourned. 3.10.  Not Fully Qualified (NFQ) for Promotion.  Board members are charged to identify any Airman who, in their opinion, is NFQ for advancement to the next higher grade. Board members, when  assessing  the  Airman’s  record,  may  recommend  to  the  Board  President  the  Airman  be rendered  NFQ  for  promotion  if,  in  their  evaluation,  they  do  not  believe  the  Airman  has demonstrated  the  potential  for  advancement.    NFQ  is  a  mechanism  designed  to  preclude promotion by default in small career fields; however, it should not normally be used to supplant the 6 to 10 scoring methodology with a pass-fail methodology.  It shall not be used to “send” a message to the eligible or the eligible’s chain of command. 50 AFI36-2502  12 DECEMBER 2014 3.10.1.  The Board President will review the record of any Airman a panel renders NFQ.  If the  board  president  believes  the  record  has  been  inconsistently  scored,  the  board  president may send the record back to the panel for verification.  Although a board member’s rationale for determining an eligible to be NFQ is not releasable, he/she should be prepared to explain the  logic  behind  the  decision  to  the  BP.    Those  individuals  which  a  majority  of  the  panel believes  are  NFQ  are  identified  as  such  in  the  board  report  and  are  not  considered  for promotion. 3.10.2.  For those AFSCs with  only one Airman eligible and that Airman is  rendered NFQ, the AFSC will be deactivated from the promotion cycle. 3.10.3.  AFPC/PB provides a list of Airmen rendered NFQ by the board to AFPC/DPSOE.  If the  board  determines    an    Airman  is    NFQ    based    on  an  evaluation    of    the    record,  the  Airman  is rendered ineligible for the promotion cycle. 3.11.  BP  Quality  Review.  In  order  to  assure  consistency  of  scoring,  the  Board  President reviews  records  from  each  AFSC  or  CEM  code  under  consideration.    To  do  this,  the  Board Secretariat takes the following actions: 3.11.1.  Prior  to  the  board,  the  staff  works  with  the  Enlisted  Promotion  &  Military  Testing Branch  and  the  Air  Staff  to  determine  (as  closely  as  possible)  the  number  of  projected promotions, as well as those AFSCs and CEM codes on the Chronic Critical Shortage Skills Listing for that promotion cycle. 3.11.2.  After the panel finishes scoring each AFSC or CEM code, the Board Secretariat staff will produce the board score relative order of merit listing for the specialty.  They will then identify  the  area  on  the  order  of  merit  corresponding  to  the  projected  promotion  quota  for that specialty by: 3.11.2.1.  Drawing  a  line  at  the  score  category  that  comes  closest  to  fulfilling  the projected quota without exceeding it. 3.11.2.2.  Drawing another line one score category lower on the order of merit. 3.11.2.3.  The Board President will then receive the following:  a representative sampling of records directly above, below, and in the identified area; the highest scoring record in the specialty; and any records found to be NFQ by the panel. 3.11.2.4.  During  his/her  review,  if  the  Board  President  believes  one  or  more  records from  this sampling were scored inconsistently, he/she then reviews all records from  the affected score categories involved and may direct rescore of any record he/she deems fit.  The  BP  will  review  the  resulting  scores  and  determine  whether  the  first  score  or  the rescore shall be the final score for the record (the BP may only direct one rescore for a particular record considered). 3.12.  Board  Report  .    AFPC/PB  prepares  board  proceeding  reports  and  handles  as  FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY, under provisions of DoD Regulation 5400.7-R_AFMAN 33-302, DoD Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Program, and retains them for the period specified in the Air Force Schedule, at https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm Disposition Records available on-line 3.12.1.  Provides a board report to AFPC/DPSOE, Enlisted Promotions and Military Testing Branch, which will discuss the proceedings of the board and identify those Airman found to AFI36-2502  12 DECEMBER 2014 51 be  NFQ  for  promotion.    Board  scores  will  flow  electronically  into  WAPS  from  the boardroom.    All  board  members,  recorders,  and  administrative  assistants/support  personnel will sign the board report.  (T-0). 3.13.  Outbrief  Board  Members.  Board  recorders  out-brief  board  members  on  the  rules  of disclosure  of  board  proceedings,  providing  some  cautions  about  what  can  and  cannot  be discussed as well as collecting all notes.  It is important that personal observations not jeopardize the credibility of the board process and that Airmen receive a consistent Air Force message. 3.13.1.  The Selection Board Secretariat staff will inform board members and administrative assistants  that  all  involved  with  the  board  process  are  prohibited  from  ever  sharing  their observations  of  board  proceedings  i.e.,  how  members  voted,  discussions  about  members’ records, lists or statistics of results, who served on which panel. 3.13.2.  Board  members  and  administrative  assistants  are  encouraged  to  use  the  briefing slides  provided  by  the  Board  Secretariat  Staff  to  brief  the  board  process  and  structure  i.e., numbers considered, board organization, steps followed. 3.14.  Board  Anomalies.  Procedural  anomalies  occurring  during  a  board  that  may  require variation from established procedures require BP resolution. During the board, the BP may bring any matter to the attention of the CSAF or AFPC/CC, if he or she determines that such decision is  required.    The  need  for  an  alternate  board  member  being  called  to  replace  a  primary  board member  will  be  treated  as  an  anomaly  and  will  follow  guidelines  specified  in  this  paragraph.  The Board President will make determinations on availability of a primary board member and an alternate board member and is the authorizing official for directing that an AFPC/CC-approved alternate replace a board member. 3.15.  Supplemental  Boards.  The  following  differences  in  procedure  apply  to  supplemental boards: 3.15.1.  Board  Organization.    Boards  will  be  constructed  with  a  Board  President  (at  least  a Brigadier  General)  and  at  least  one  panel.  Each  panel  will  be  composed  of  board  members from  one  of  the  four  career  areas.    For  example,  one  panel  could  have  a  mission  support group  commander,  an  operations  chief  master  sergeant,  and  a  maintenance  chief  master sergeant.    Panels  will  not  be  confined  to  scoring  specific  AFSCs  or  CEMs.    Similarly,  one panel will not necessarily see all the records from a specific AFSC or CEM. 3.15.2.  Determining Select/Non-Select Status.  AFPC/DPSOE determines what board score an eligible would have needed in order to beat the promotion cutoff from the original board.  See paragraphs 2.7 and 2.6.2. 3.15.2.1.  An  eligible  Airman’s  record  is  compared  to  benchmark  records.  Benchmark records are: three records with the same required score as identified in paragraph  3.15.3 (“plus”  benchmark)  and  three  records  a  half  point  below  (“minus”  benchmark).    All records are “aged” to appear as they would have on the original board, and all records are scored together. 3.15.2.2.  The panel compares the supplemental record against the benchmarked records to determine selection status. 3.15.2.3.  An eligible is a “Select” if he/she outscores all “minus” benchmarks and ties or outscores  at  least  one  of  the  “plus”  benchmarks.    Unlike  evaluation  boards,  there  is  no 52 AFI36-2502  12 DECEMBER 2014 quota on supplemental boards.  The decision tree at Figure 3.2 will be used to determine select/non-select status. 3.15.3.  Differentials.    When  benchmark  records  are  not  available  at  the  required  “minus” scores,  AFPC/DPSOE  will  go  to  the  next  available  lower  score  categories  for  “minus” benchmarks.    When  this  occurs,  the  point  differential  (difference  between  the  required benchmark score and the actual benchmarks used) must be accounted for when applying the decision tree.  The differential will not exceed minus 3 points. 3.15.4.  Inversion.  Some degree of inversion is to be expected.  Only the most extreme cases warrant  a potential  rescore of the records.  The enlisted supplemental  decision tree outlines those cases and directs when a rescore is allowed, subject to BP approval. 3.15.5.  New Documents.  New documents are not applicable in the supplemental process. Figure 3.2.  SNCO Supplemental Decision Tree 3.16.  Disclosure  of  Board  Proceedings.  The  list  of  board  members  will  be  released  in conjunction  with  the  release  of  the  board  results  (approximately  3-4  weeks  following  board adjournment).    At  that  time,  board  members  may  discuss  the  board  process  and  procedures, board organization, and the number of eligibles considered.   Board members may never disclose how board members voted, who sat on each panel, or what AFSCs they scored.  In addition, they may  not  keep  lists  or  statistics  from  the  board.    Board  members  are  also  prohibited  from discussing their personal observations about the strengths and weaknesses in the records. 3.17.  Summary.  These evaluation board procedures were developed to give all eligible Airmen fair and equitable consideration, not for ease of administration.  While it in many ways mirrors the officer selection board process, SNCO evaluation boards are not governed by law and are not  AFI36-2502  12 DECEMBER 2014 53 the sole determinant of promotion and as such bear significant differences. These procedures will remain in effect until otherwise modified in writing. 54 AFI36-2502  12 DECEMBER 2014 Chapter 4 *REGULAR AIR FORCE AIRMAN PROMOTION ACTIONS 4.1.  Officer Training Candidates. 4.1.1.  MPS: 4.1.2.  Notify  Airmen  they  are  ineligible  for  promotion  consideration  when  entering  Air Force  commissioning  programs  on  or  before  PECD.    If  Airmen  enter  an  Air  Force commissioning  program  after  PECD  but  before  selections  are  made,  they  will  not  be considered for promotion.  (T-3) 4.1.3.  Promote  Airmen  entering  the  Airman  Education  and  Commissioning  Program (AECP),  Officer  Training  School  (OTS),  Nurse  Enlisted  Commissioning  Program  (NECP), Physician Assistant (PA) or Academy of Military Science (AMS) programs as follows: 4.1.3.1.  Promote  Airmen  in  grades  SrA  and  below  to  SSgt  effective  1  day  before  their scheduled PCS or TDY departure.  (T-3) 4.1.3.2.  Airmen  entering  AECP,  OTS  or  NECP  with  a  projected  promotion  to  TSgt  or above will retain PSN and be promoted when incremented regardless of whether it occurs before or after the Airman enters the commissioning program. 4.1.4.  Promote Airmen selected for the Air Force Academy with a PSN before entry.  Do not promote  Airmen  with  PSNs  after  program  entry;  place  memorandums  in  their  records  to show selected grade, cycle, and PSN.  Prior service disenrolled Airmen receive their former grade  and  DOR  with  the  effective  date  as  the  EAD  date;  second  year  disenrolled  Airmen receive the grade determined by AFI 36-2604, Service Dates and Dates of Rank.  (T-3) 4.1.5.  Demote  eliminated  Airmen  to  their  former  grades  per  Chapter  6,  and  then  promote them to the highest grades entitled effective the day following demotions.  The DOR of the higher grades are the original DORs (AFI 36-2014, Commissioning Education). (T-3) 4.1.6.  Notify Airmen promotion eligibility may be reinstated (see paragraph  4.3.) if they are eliminated  from  training  through  no  fault  of  their  own.    The  training  facility  commander must make a recommendation for reinstatement.  (T-3) 4.1.7.  Discharge Airmen selected for the Airman Scholarship  and Commissioning Program (ASCP)  and  enlist  them  into  the  AF  Reserve.    Airmen  with  PSNs  that  increment  prior  to entry  into  ASCP  will  be  authorized  to  assume  the  grade.    Place  memos  with  PSNs  in  the records of Airmen who  have PSNs that will increment after entry (listing  grade and cycle).  For those who do not complete ASCP, see AFI 36-2604, Service Dates and Dates of Rank, to determine active duty grade and DOR.  (T-3) 4.1.8.  Airmen selected for the Technical Degree Scholarship Program (TDSP) will enlist in the Regular Air Force for a period of 48 months, serve in the grade of A1C while completing the degree requirement, and receive basic pay and privileges of that grade.  These Airmen are not  entitled  to  promotion  to  SrA  or  SrA  BTZ  while  completing  the  TDSP  academic  phase.  After completion of the degree requirement, Airmen will attend OTS and will be promoted to SSgt effective 1 day before departure, but no earlier than 11th day before report no later than date.    Upon  graduation  from  OTS,  Airmen  will  be  discharged  from  enlisted  status  and AFI36-2502  12 DECEMBER 2014 55 tendered  a  commission  as  a  Regular  officer  in  the  United  States  Air  Force  in  the  grade  of second lieutenant. 4.1.8.1.  Eliminees from the TDSP academic phase will choose a 4-year commission or a 2-year  enlistment.    2-year  enlistees  entitled  to  a  grade  higher  than  A1C  due  to  prior service will require grade and service date verification to determine the appropriate grade and  DOR  the  Airman  is  entitled  to.    2-year  enlistees  with  no  prior  service  will  be promoted to A1C with a DOR equal to the Basic Military Training start date. 4.1.9.  ROTC  disenrollees  will  serve  a  2-year  enlistment  and  will  be  accessed  to  the appropriate grade prior to entering active duty.  Airmen will receive a DOR equal to date of entry into the ROTC program and an effective date equal to the date of EAD. 4.1.9.1.  After  accessed,  Airmen  are  authorized  one  promotion  to  Amn  or  A1C  base  on their  assessed  DOR    per  TIG  requirements  in  paragraph    2.1.    The  DOR  and  effective date for this one promotion is  the EAD. Consecutive promotions based on the accessed grade and DOR prior to EAD are not authorized (Airmen cannot be promoted from AB to A1C). AFPC/DPSOE updates the one promotion via CMS. Their next promotion is based on the TIG requirement in paragraph 2.1 or 2.2. Accessed A1Cs who receive an adjusted DOR will be eligible for SrA after 28 months TIG, but must also serve a minimum of 12 months from EAD prior to pinning on SrA.  These members will not be eligible for SrA BTZ.  This also applies to United States Air Force Academy Cadet disenrollees. 4.2.  Nonrecommending,  Deferring,  and  Withholding  Promotions.  The  action  may  be initiated and approved by the unit commander or director of civilian led units for Airman in the grades  AB  -  TSgt.  The  nonrecommendation,  deferral,  or  withhold  can  be  initiated  by  the  unit commander, but is approved by the promotion authority for Airmen in grades MSgt and SMSgt (see paragraph  1.5.). 4.2.1.  Unit Commanders: 4.2.1.1.  Inform  Airmen  of  adverse  actions  in  writing  or  verbally  before  promotion effective  date  (confirm  verbal  notification  in  writing  within  5  duty  days).    The notification  memorandum  must  include  reasons,  dates,  occurrences,  and  duration  of  the action.  If the Airman is notified verbally prior to effective date, and written notification is  followed  up  after  effective  date  of  promotion,  include  a  statement  confirming  the Airman was verbally notified not to assume the higher grade prior to the effective date of promotion.      For  actions  on  those  in  grades  SrA  through  SMSgt,  include  the  affected promotion cycle. Obtain promotion authority approval for Airmen in grades of MSgt and SMSgt.  (T-3) 4.2.1.2.  Obtain the Airmen’s written acknowledgment.  (T-3) 4.2.1.3.  Forward  the  written  notification  to  the  MPS  to  send  for  file  in  the  Airman’s ARMS record and updates MilPDS.  (T-3) 4.2.2.  Nonrecommending  Promotion.  Nonrecommendation  for  promotion  should  be  used when  an  Airman’s  behavior  does  not  adhere  to  established  standards.    Promotion reinstatement  is  not  authorized.    For  promotion  nonrecommendation  actions/ineligibility conditions: 56 AFI36-2502  12 DECEMBER 2014 4.2.2.1.  Separate  written  nonrecommendations  are  not  required  for  Airmen  otherwise ineligible according to Table 1.1. (except for Rule 8, where the ineligibility condition is specifically “nonrecommendation for promotion”). 4.2.2.2.  A1Cs and below, ineligible for promotion under Table 1.1. (except for Rule 8), will  become  eligible  for  promotion  upon  completion  of  the  ineligibility  condition  if otherwise eligible and recommended by the commander. 4.2.2.3.  Promotion  DOR  will  be  the  date  the  Airman  became  eligible  and  the  effective date will be the date of written recommendation by the commander for those exceeding TIG/TIS  requirements.    A  retroactive  promotion  effective  date  may  be  requested according to paragraph  1.14. 4.2.2.4.  Nonrecommend A1Cs and below in monthly increments up to 6 months (Table 1.1, Rule 8). 4.2.2.4.1.  Promotion  DOR  and  effective  date  will  be  the  anniversary  day  of  the original  promotion  date,  but  only  if  the  anniversary  day  falls  after  the  date  the commander recommends promotion in writing.  EXAMPLE:   If  DOR to Amn is 9 Mar 06 and  commander  recommends promotion  in  writing  10 Mar 07 or  later, then DOR to A1C is 9 Apr 07; if commander recommends promotion in writing 8 Mar 07 or earlier, then DOR to A1C is 9 Mar 07. 4.2.2.4.2.  Six-year  enlistees  with  a  contract  guaranteeing  A1C  upon  completion  of Basic  Military  Training  and  Technical  Training  who  are  nonrecommended  for promotion will have their contract voided. 4.2.2.4.3.  Remove  BTZ  selects  from  a  selection  list  and  inform  them  they  remain ineligible until fully qualified (see paragraph  2.2.).  (T-3) 4.2.2.5.  Nonrecommendation for Airmen in grades SrA and above (for pin-on or testing) only applies for one promotion cycle at a time. 4.2.2.5.1.  MPS must send a copy of the nonrecommendation to AFPC/DPSOE when the  promotion  authority  (see  paragraph    1.5.)  approves  the  nonrecommendation  for promotion (to include testing) for a MSgt or SMSgt. 4.2.3.  Deferring  Promotion.  Deferring  a  promotion  delays  the  promotion  and  pay  past  the original effective date to allow the commander to determine if the Airman meets acceptable behavior or performance standards.  For deferring promotion to SSgt through CMSgt: 4.2.3.1.  The deferral duration is for 1 to 3 months. 4.2.3.2.  Wing or equivalent level commanders may approve deferring promotion beyond 3 months to SSgt through MSgt.  Equivalent level commander is the first senior rater in a commander’s position in the Airman’s reporting chain. 4.2.3.3.  The promotion authority (see paragraph  1.5.) approves deferring promotions to SMSgt and CMSgt. 4.2.3.4.  The  promotion  authority  must  make  a  promotion  decision,  in  writing,  upon completion  of  the  deferral  period.    DOR  and  effective  date  is  the  1st  day  of  the  month after the deferral period ends and cannot be retroactive. AFI36-2502  12 DECEMBER 2014 57 4.2.3.5.  If  a  promotion  is  deferred  and  then  withheld,  the  DOR  is  the  1st  day  of  the month after the deferral  period ended and  cannot be retroactive to  the what  the original DOR would had been if no deferral was taken. 4.2.4.  Withholding Promotion  . Commanders must be advised withholding a promotion is not used as a punishment or inducement for an Airman to conform to acceptable standards of performance.  Withholding action is taken after promotion selection but before the effective date of promotion.  For withholding promotions: 4.2.4.1.  The promotion of any Airman is  withheld when he or she possesses any of the conditions  listed  in  Table  1.2.    Written  commander  notifications  are  required  for  all conditions  listed  in  Table  1.2.    Commanders  will  clearly  state  specific  reasons  for  all withholding actions.  MPS will return memorandums not stating the specific reasons for withholding actions to commanders and reference this paragraph. 4.2.4.2.  Wing  or  equivalent  level  commanders  may  approve  withholding  promotions longer than 1 year.  Equivalent level commander is the first senior rater in a commander’s position in the Airman’s reporting chain.  The promotion authority (see paragraph   1.5.) approves withholding promotions to SMSgt and CMSgt. 4.2.4.3.  Airmen receive their original DOR; the effective date is the date the commander terminates  the  withhold  action  and  recommends  promotion.    See  paragraph    1.15  for corrections to effective dates. 4.2.4.4.  Airmen  whose  promotions  were  withheld,  and  later  changed  to  a  deferral,  will receive a DOR no later than the 1st  day of the third month after the original  promotion effective  date.    NOTE:    Wing/CC  or  equivalent  must  approve  deferring  promotion beyond 3 months. (T-3) 4.3.  Promotion  Reinstatement.  This  procedure  only  applies  to  Airmen  removed  from  the control  roster  or  who  completed  Article  15  suspended  reduction.  Reinstatement  includes promotion  testing,  consideration  for  promotion  if  tests  are  on  file,  or  for  previous  selects  that become ineligible. 4.3.1.  Wing or equivalent  level  commander (equivalent  level  commander is  the first senior rater  in  a  commander’s  position  in  the  Airman’s  reporting  chain)  may  approve:  (EXCEPTION:  Reinstatement to the grades of SMSgt and CMSgt must be forwarded to the promotion authority. (see paragraph  1.5.)  (T-3) 4.3.1.1.  For  reinstatement  requests  for  Airmen  who  were  found  ineligible  because  their records  had  incomplete  or  wrong  data,  the  DOR  is  the  date  of  original  increment  and effective  date  is  date  of  reinstatement  approval.  Individuals  may  request  a  retroactive promotion effective date according to paragraph  1.15. 4.3.2.  Commanders: 4.3.2.1.  Should  initiate  reinstatement  requests  for  Airmen  ineligible  for  promotion  to grades  SSgt  through  CMSgt  for  only  the  most  deserving  cases  (including  Airmen  who were selects), and send reinstatement requests through the MPS for processing. 4.3.2.2.  Requests for reinstatement  should not  be approved solely  because commanders reverse decisions that originally rendered Airmen ineligible. 58 AFI36-2502  12 DECEMBER 2014 4.3.3.  DOR  and  effective  date  for  approved  promotion  sequence  number  (PSN) reinstatements  to  grades  SSgt  through  CMSgt  are  the  1st  day  of  the  month  following  the month  the  commander  initiated  reinstatement  action  if  promotion  increment  has  passed.  MPS send a copy of the reinstatement to AFPC/DPSOE providing the Airman’s name, SSN, cycle,  date  commander  initiated  reinstatement,  date  reinstatement  was  approved,  and circumstances surrounding the reinstatement. AFPC/DPSOE will provide testing instructions if  tests  were  not  previously  administered  supplemental  consideration  if  tests  are  on  file,  or update grade data in MilPDS if the Airman was a previous select. 4.3.4.  An  Airman  or  the  Airman’s  unit  commander  may  request  reinstatement  for  reasons not  covered  above.    This  exception  is  not  intended  for  use  as  a  rehabilitative  tool  for improved  behavior.    Requests  should  be  limited  to  those  extreme  cases  that  warrant reinstatement.    MPS  forward  fully  documented  exception  to  policy  requests  through  the Airman’s  wing  commander,  or  the  promotion  authority  for  SMSgt  and  CMSgt,  to AFPC/DPSOE for final decision. All levels of command may disapprove these requests and discontinue further processing.  The DOR and effective date for approved reinstatements to grades  SSgt  through  CMSgt  are  the  1st  day  of  the  month  following  the  month  the commander initiated reinstatement action. 4.4.  Applying for Correction of Records.  Airmen who believe they have suffered injustice in their  promotion  consideration  are  encouraged  to  exhaust  all  administrative  remedies  prior  to applying  to  the  Air  Force  Board  for  Correction  of  Military  Records  (AFBCMR)  under  the provisions of AFI 36-2603, AFBCMR.  The application for correction of military records should be  filed  within  3  years  after  discovering  the  alleged  error  or  injustice;  however,  the  AFBCMR may waive untimely filing in the interest of justice. AFI36-2502  12 DECEMBER 2014 59 Chapter 5 THE USAF BAND ENLISTED PROMOTION AND PROPRIETY REVIEW PROCESS 5.1.  Premier  Band.  The  United  States  Air  Force  Band  (The  USAF  Band),  Joint  Base Anacostia-Bolling, DC, is the Air Force’s sole Premier Band. 5.2.  Background.  To support CONUS and worldwide mission requirements, The USAF Band accesses  fully  qualified  professional  musicians.    The  USAF  Band  members  are  by-pass specialists  who  do  not  enter  into  formal  upgrade  training  to  attain  craftsman  (7-skill  level) designation.  The USAF Band competes with the other services' premier bands and the civilian sector in recruiting fully qualified professional musicians.  While assigned to The USAF Band, members  are  deferred  from  rotational  PCS  moves.    Special  enlisted  promotion  authority  is granted only for band members assigned to the USAF Band because: 5.2.1.  Recruiting fully qualified professional musicians saves training costs and time. 5.2.2.  Recruiting  and  retaining  fully  qualified  professional  musicians  to  The  USAF  Band requires an incentive. 5.2.3.  Members are deferred from rotational PCS moves and must compete for promotion to internal vacancies rather than external quotas. 5.3.  Promotion Authority.  The Commander, Air Force District of Washington (AFDW/CC) is The USAF Band promotion authority. 5.4.  Promotion  Objective.  The  objective  of  The  USAF  Band  promotion  process  is  to  fill existing  and  forecasted  vacancies  based  on  authorized  unit  manning  with  the  best-qualified candidates.    All  assigned  members  who  have  shown  potential  for  increased  responsibility  and meet the minimum eligibility requirements will be considered for promotion. 5.4.1.  Due  to  the  highly  specialized  nature  of  positions  in  the  USAF  Band,  it  conducts  a separate promotion process based on internal unit vacancies.  Promotion to TSgt is effective upon  the  day  the  member  first  reports  for  duty  with  The  USAF  Band  and  requires  the approval  of  the  promotion  authority  or  its  designated  representative.    There  are  no  TIS  or TIG requirements. 5.4.2.  Promotion to the grades of MSgt, SMSgt, and CMSgt are made one grade at a time to an  existing  vacancy.    The  number  of  personnel  selected  for  promotion  is  based  on  existing and  forecasted  vacancies  during  the  promotion  cycle  under  consideration.    All  selects  not promoted  prior  to  the  end  of  the  promotion  cycle  will  be  promoted  the  first  day  of  the following month. 5.5.  The  USAF  Band  Promotion  Cycle.  The  PECD  for  all  cycles  is  31  March.    Promotion testing  for  The  USAF  Band  members  will  be  conducted  during  normal  scheduled  Air  Force promotion testing cycles.  The promotion board will meet in the month of June and evaluate the selection records for all eligible members for MSgt, SMSgt and CMSgt.  Promotion dates begin on 1 August and end on 31 July of the following year.   AFDW/A1, Director of Personnel, will provide eligible members a copy of the promotion fact sheet. 5.6.  Promotion  Quotas.  The USAF Band promotion quotas for each grade are determined by AFDW/A1 based on existing and forecasted vacancies during the promotion cycle as of 31 May.  60 AFI36-2502  12 DECEMBER 2014 A vacancy is defined as an existing unfilled authorization.  A forecasted vacancy is defined as an authorization which will become unfilled as a result of retirement, separation, PCS, etc., during the  promotion  cycle.    Unforecasted  vacancies  which  occur  after  31  May  are  not  added  to  the promotion quota. 5.7.  Eligibility  Requirements.  To  be  eligible  for  promotion  under  this  authority,  members must  possess  Control  Air  Force  Specialty  Code  (CAFSC)  and  Duty  Air  Force  Specialty  Code (DAFSC) 3N2X1.  To be eligible for the next higher grade, members of The USAF Band must meet minimum time in service and time in grade requirements (see Table 5.1). 5.7.1.  Eligibility for PFE/USAFSE Testing.  Due to the variation between Air Force PECDs and The USAF Band PECDs, different criteria must be used to determine eligibility to test.  To be eligible to test for the next higher grade, members of The USAF Band must meet the eligibility  requirements  in  Table    5.1  and  must  not  be  declared  ineligible  on  the  basis  of Table 5.2. 5.8.  Deferring,  Withholding  and  NonRecommending  Promotions.  Band  members  must  be recommended for promotion by The USAF Band Commander.  The commander will forward the eligibility/ineligibility roster to the AFDW/A1 staff no later than 15 April.  See paragraph   4.2. for nonrecommending, deferring, and withholding promotions. 5.9.  Data Collection and Verification.  Upon PECD, the AFDW A1 staff will initiate actions to begin the promotion consideration process. 5.9.1.  By  15  April,  each  eligible  member  should  verify  their  Promotion  Data  Verification Brief  (DVB)  by  logging  into  vMPF  on  the  AFPC  web  page.    Members  must  identify  any discrepancies on the DVB to their servicing MPS or Base Education Office. 5.10.  The Promotion Board  .  The promotion board is an essential element in The USAF Band promotion  process.    Selection  records  are  evaluated  based  on  the  whole  person  concept  with  a maximum  board  score  of  450  points.    All  eligible  members  will  have  their  selection  record reviewed and scored by the promotion board. 5.10.1.  The  promotion  board  will  be  chaired  by  a  General  Officer  or  Brigadier  General Select  (if  a  General  Officer  is  unavailable,  a  colonel  may  chair  the  promotion  board).    The three  voting  members  of  the  promotion  board  will  be  a  colonel  from  a  non  band  AFSC,  a CMSgt  from  a  non  band  AFSC  and  a  CMSgt  band  manager  who  is  not  and  has  not  been assigned as a member of The USAF Band.  The promotion board members will be nominated by the AFDW A1 staff and appointed by the promotion authority.  No board members will serve on consecutive boards and no member assigned to The USAF Band will be appointed to the promotion board. 5.11.  Determining  Selects,  Promotion  Sequence  Numbers  and  Establishing  Dates  of Rank.  Promotion selections are based on the promotion quota (see paragraph  5.6).  AFDW/A1 will release promotion sequence numbers.  Selects are promoted in sequence to the first available vacancies at the appropriate grade until all selects are promoted.  Unfilled vacancies are carried over to the next promotion cycle. 5.11.1.  Promotion  Dates  of  Rank.    When  vacancies  occur  on  the  first  day  of  the  month, promotions  are  made  on  that  day.    When  vacancies  occur  after  the  first  day  of  the  month, promotions are made on the first day of the following month. AFI36-2502  12 DECEMBER 2014 61 5.12.  Selection List.  The promotion selection list is prepared by the AFDW staff and routed to the promotion authority for final approval. 5.13.  Supplemental  Promotions.  Current  Air  Force  policy  will  be  used  when  determining supplemental  consideration.   Each  individual  must  submit  a  request  for  supplemental consideration in writing to AFDW A1. 5.13.1.  The  three  voting  members  of  the  supplemental  promotion  board  will  consist  of  the Chief Enlisted Force Policy (HQ USAF/A1PPE), a Colonel and another CMSgt.  The AFDW A1 will appoint and convene the panel. 5.14.  Promotion Propriety Review.  As stated in paragraph  5.2, members of The USAF Band are  fully  qualified  professional  musicians  and  are  granted  the  privilege  of  promotion  under  the authority of this instruction while assigned to The USAF Band.  In order to be assigned to The USAF  Band,  each  member  underwent  an  extensive  audition  and  interview  process.  Should  the member fail to continue to meet these high standards, they may be involuntarily removed from the  organization.    Any  member  determined  by  the  commander  to  have  failed  to  maintain  The UASF  Band standards can voluntarily  apply  for  retraining into  a different  Air  Force Specialty.  Any  member  may  also  request  a  voluntary  reassignment.    A  grade  determination  will  be conducted through the Promotion Propriety Review Board (see paragraph   5.14.2) for members being  reassigned  voluntarily  or  involuntarily  from  The  USAF  Band.  Members  voluntarily  or involuntarily  released  from  the  band  will  be  reclassified  in  accordance  with  AFI  36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel (Officers and Enlisted). 5.14.1.  Statement  of  Understanding.    Members  will  be  required  to  sign  the  Statement  of Understanding  (see  Attachment  2)  as  part  of  their  in-processing  when  first  assigned  to  The USAF  Band.    This  will  be  filed  in  the  member's  Automated  Records  Management  System (ARMS). 5.14.2.  Promotion  Propriety  Review  Board.    The  function  of  the  Promotion  Propriety Review  Board  is  to  perform  a  grade  propriety  review  (GPR)  on  enlisted  members  of  The USAF  Band  who  will  be  reassigned  to  a  new  career  field  or  to  a  regional  band.    Members assigned to a new career field will be assigned in accordance with AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel  (Officers  and Enlisted).   The assessment process  seeks to  determine the grade and/or date of rank (DOR) appropriate to the member upon entry into the new  career field or change of assignment. 5.14.2.1.  Promotion  Propriety  Review  Board  Members.    For  The  USAF  Band,  the AFDW/CV  (or  their  appointed  colonel  designate),  The  USAF  Band  Commander  and AFDW/CCC  (or  their  appointed  CMSgt  designate)  will  comprise  the  Promotion Propriety  Review  Board.    A  representative  from  the  AFDW/A1  staff  will  serve  as  the facilitator and a member from The USAF Band will serve as the technical representative. 5.14.2.2.  Review Package. AFDW/A1 staff will prepare a review package, to be used by the Promotion Propriety Review Board, as the basis for its assessment.  As a minimum, the  review  package  should  contain  data  comparing  the  member  under  review  to  the USAF  at  large  and  the  new  career  field  (average  Air  Force  time-in-grade  and  time-in-service  phase  points),  Individual  Data  Review  RIP,  Security  Clearance  Eligibility Record,  Assignment  Notification,  PCS  orders  to  The  USAF  Band,  copies  of  all performance reports, copies of all award citations and a copy of the signed “Statement of 62 AFI36-2502  12 DECEMBER 2014 Understanding.”   NOTE:  The member under review may submit, in  writing, their own assessment  to  the  AFDW/A1  staff  for  inclusion  in  the  review  package.    This  written assessment should address the factors in the board’s decision. 5.14.2.3.  The  senior  board  member  will  forward  the  board’s  recommendation  to  the AFDW/A1,  who  will  forward  it  to  the  band  career  field  manager  (SAF/PAR)  for coordination  no  later  than  90  days  prior  to  the  member’s  departure  for  the  new assignment.    In  turn,  SAF/PAR  will  forward  the  board’s  recommendation  to  HQ USAF/A1PPE for final  determination and approval.   HQ USAF/A1PPE will inform  the AFDW/A1  of  its  decision.    The  USAF  Band  Commander  may  verbally  inform  the member of the board’s recommendation upon completion of the propriety review. 5.14.3.  The AFDW/A1 will notify The USAF Band Commander of the final  determination made by HQ USAF/A1PPE.  The commander will immediately notify the member in writing of  the  GPR  determination  by  memorandum.    The  commander  will  forward  a  copy  of  the notification memorandum to the AFDW A1 staff for inclusion in the member’s ARMS.  The AFDW/A1  staff  will  ensure  demotion/date  of  rank  adjustment  orders  are  completed  and distributed  appropriately  (i.e.,  gaining  MPS,  member,  AFPC/DPSOE).    Grade  and  DOR changes  take  effect  on  the  day  the  member  arrives  at  their  new  duty  station  (Date  Arrived Station). 5.14.4.  GPR  Objective.    The  GPR  will  be  based  on  the  whole  person  concept.    As  a minimum, the Promotion Propriety Review Board should consider the following factors: 5.14.4.1.  Has the member received the proper training to serve in the new career field at the rank which they presently hold? 5.14.4.2.  Does  the  member  have  the  kinds  of  duty  experiences  at  the  grade  level commensurate with the new career field position? 5.14.4.3.  Has  the  member  demonstrated  the  leadership  and  management  skills  required in the new career field? 5.14.4.4.  Has  the  member  achieved  the  average  TIS  and  TIG,  both  in  the  new  career field  and  in  the  Air  Force  at  large,  to  avoid  creating  an  unfair  promotion  competition advantage over their new career field peers?  NOTE:  Members being assigned to a new career field will not retain any grade for which they do not meet the  minimum Air Force TIS  requirements  in  Table  2.1  or  be  given  DOR  earlier  than  possible  under  those  TIS requirements. 5.14.5.  GPR Board Recommendations.  The Promotion Propriety  Review Board may make any of the following recommendations: 5.14.5.1.  Allow the member to retain their current rank and time in grade. 5.14.5.2.  Allow the member to retain their current rank, but have their DOR adjusted in accordance  with  determinations  made  with  respect  to  paragraph    5.14.4.    NOTE:    A member’s downward-adjusted DOR may extend to any period including present date of rank. 5.14.5.3.  Demote to a rank and DOR commensurate to members with similar TIS in the new career field or the Air Force at large.  The DOR for the grade to which demoted may be either the average date of rank held  by other  Airmen in  that grade in  the new career AFI36-2502  12 DECEMBER 2014 63 field or the DOR actually held if previously promoted to the grade under other Air Force promotion  systems.    NOTE:    A  member  cannot  be  demoted  below  a  grade  previously earned under the Air Force promotion system governing the gaining career field. 5.14.6.  GPR  Resulting  Administrative  Actions.    AFDW/A1  staff  notifies  the  local  FSS  to publish  any  required  demotion/DOR  adjustment  guidance  for  the  gaining  MPS,  and  AFPC/DPSOE to project DOR. Table 5.1.  Minimum Eligibility Requirements for The USAF Band Promotion R U L E 1 2 3 4 If promotion is to the grade of TSgt MSgt SMSgt  (see note) CMSgt (see note) and the time in current grade computed on the first day of the month before the month promotions are made N/A 24 months 20 months 21 months and the TAFMS date on the first day of the last month of the promotion cycle then DAS 6 years 10 years 14 years the Airman is eligible for promotion if recommended, in writing by the promotion authority  NOTE:  SNCO Academy (correspondence or in-residence) and Associates Degree from Community College of the Air Force (CCAF) must be completed prior to PECD for promotion eligibility.  Table 5.2.

Do  not  use  administrative  demotions  when  it  is  more  appropriate  to  take actions specified by the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). 6.1.l.  The home station unit commander recommends demotion action to the demotion authority (paragraph 6.2).  Deployed commanders must send demotion actions to the home station unit commander for action.  The home station unit commander will complete coordination with the appropriate demotion authority.  (T-0). 6.1.2.  Do not demote Airmen who have separated. 6.1.3.  Begin  administrative  demotion  for  action  during  the  term  of  enlistment  when  the reason  for  the  action  occurred,  except  when  the  commander  is  not  aware  of  the  facts  and circumstances until after that term of enlistment expires. 6.1.4.  If  the  commander  has  sufficient  reason  to  initiate  demotion  action,  use  the  entire military record in deciding whether demotion is appropriate. 6.1.5.  When appropriate, give Airmen an opportunity to overcome their deficiencies before demotion  action  is  initiated.  Commanders  should  maintain  supporting  documentation  of  all rehabilitation and probationary actions. 6.1.6.  Do  not  suspend  administrative  demotions.  The  demotion  authority,  with administrative  jurisdiction,  can  restore  the  individual’s  original  grade.  If  the  demotion authority restores the Airman’s original grade following the demotion, he or she must do so sometime between 3 months and 6 months after the effective date of the demotion. 6.1.6.1.  Restoring grade should be an uncommon occurrence. The effective date and the date of rank (DOR) are the date on which the demotion authority approves restoration in writing. 6.1.6.2.  Do not revoke demotion orders.  File the demotion order in the Airman’s ARMS record  along  with  the  memorandum  approving  the  restoration.    Create  a  CMS  case  and include restoration package/memorandum and refer the case to AFPC/DPSOE.  (T-0). 6.1.6.3.  Initiating restoration beyond 6 months  after the effective date of  demotion  will require an exception to policy.  This exception is not intended for use as a rehabilitative tool  for  improved  behavior.    Requests  should  be  limited  to  those  extreme  cases  that warrant restoration.  MPS forward fully documented exception to policy requests initiated by the demotion authority through the Airman’s wing commander with coordination from JA  (if  they  are  not  the  demotion  authority)  to  AFPC/DPSOE  for  final  decision  by AF/A1P.  All levels of command may disapprove these requests and discontinue further processing.  (T-1). 6.2.  Who Can Demote. 6.2.1.  The  group  commander,  or  equivalent  level  commander,  may  demote  MSgts  and below. Equivalent level  commander is  defined as a senior Air  Force officer in  the  grade of colonel.  EXAMPLE:    An  Air  Force  officer  in  charge  of  an  Air  Force  Element  or  a AFI36-2502  12 DECEMBER 2014 65 commander above the squadron level.  NOTE: Higher levels of command may also demote, but group commander is the lowest level of authority. 6.2.2.  The  MAJCOM  commander,  FOA  commander  and    DRU  commander,  may  demote those in the grades of SMSgt and CMSgt. This demotion authority may be delegated to the MAJCOM  vice  commander,  Deputy  Chief  of  Staff  for  Manpower,  Personnel  and  Services, Numbered  Air  Force  (NAF),  or  equivalent  level  commanders,  but  may  not  be  further delegated. 6.2.3.  The  appellate  authority  is  the  next  higher  level  commander  and  handles  demotion appeals. 6.2.4.  The Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) may demote to significantly reduce strength, grade levels, or both. 6.3.  Reasons to Demote. 6.3.1.  Student  Status  Termination.  Airmen  are  demoted  to  their  former  grade  when  their student status ends if they were promoted in anticipation of completing additional training, or to obtain a commission. 6.3.1.1.  Demote  officer  trainees  or  pipeline  students  to  their  former  grade  if  they  are eliminated from training. 6.3.1.2.  Delay the demotion when an Airman would lose authorization to ship household goods,  move  dependents,  or  both,  until  he  or  she  arrives  at  the  new  duty  location (permanent  change  of  station  [PCS]).    The  gaining  commander  completes  demotion action  using  the  effective  date  as  the  date  when  the  Airman  arrives  at  the  new  duty location. 6.3.1.3.  Demote  Airmen  attending  temporary  duty  (TDY)  Air  Force  schools  to  their former  grade  when  the  school  commandant  informs  the  base  that  their  student  status  is terminated. 6.3.2.  If a member is promoted to SSgt, TSgt, or SMSgt with an approved EPME waiver and later is dismissed for cause, declines DL or in residence PME. 6.3.3.  Demotion  Based  on Skill  Levels.  Demote Airmen, when  appropriate, to  a  grade that corresponds to their skill level. 6.3.3.1.  Demote Airmen, including Airmen promoted with a Primary Air Force Specialty Code (PAFSC) waiver, if they cannot achieve a skill level appropriate to their grade. 6.3.3.2.  Demote Airmen to the highest possible grade allowed for the skills they have if their  Air  Force  specialty  (AFS)  skill  level  is  downgraded  for  substandard  performance. Use the date their skill level was reduced as the effective date of demotion. 6.3.4.  Failure  to  fulfill  Responsibilities.  Airmen  may  be  demoted  for  failing  to  fulfill Airman,  noncommissioned  officer  (NCO),  or  senior  noncommissioned  officer  (SNCO) responsibilities under AFI 36-2618, The Enlisted Force Structure, Chapters 3 through 5. 6.3.5.  Failure to  Keep Fit.  Airmen may be demoted for failing to  maintain  or demonstrate the  ability  and  willingness  to  attain  physical  standards,  according  to  AFI  36-2905,  Fitness Program. 66 AFI36-2502  12 DECEMBER 2014 6.3.6.  Failure  to  Perform.  Demote  Airmen  under  the  policies  of  the  Personnel  Support Division (AFDW/A1K), and this instruction, if they do not perform at USAF or USAF Space Command bands standards (applies to AFSC 3N2X1). 6.3.7.  Voluntary  Reassignment  or  Reclassification.  Demote  Airmen  under  the  policies  and procedures established by AFDW/A1P if they volunteer for reassignment or reclassification out of AFSC 3N2X1. 6.4.  How to Process a Demotion. 6.4.1.  The Unit Commander: 6.4.1.1.  Signs the notification memorandum informing the Airman of intent to demote. 6.4.1.2.  Cites  this  instruction,  the  specific  paragraph,  demotion  authority  if  other  than initiating  commander,  the  recommended  grade  for  demotion,  the  specific  reasons  for demotion, and provides a summary of the facts. 6.4.1.3.  Ensures the following information is included in the notification memorandum: 6.4.1.3.1.  “I  (concur)(do  not  concur)  with  the  proposed  demotion;  I  (will  or  have) (will  not  or  have  not)  (submit  or  submitted)  written  materials  on  my  behalf.  I (request)(waive)  a  personal  hearing  before  the  initiating  commander.  I  (have)(have not) consulted with counsel.” 6.4.1.4.  Advises the Airman that he or she may seek legal counsel. The unit commander provides  the  name  and  number  of  the  local  Area  Defense  Counsel  who  can  assist  with written and oral statements. 6.4.1.5.  Informs the Airman (if eligible) of the right to  apply for retirement in lieu of a demotion,  effective  no  later  than  the  1st  day  of  the  4th  month  following  the  initial notification of demotion, as follows: 6.4.1.5.1.  Within  3  working  days  of  Airman’s  acknowledgement  of  demotion memorandum,  if  eligible  to  retire,  indicate  the  member  understands  the  option  to apply for retirement in  lieu of demotion.   Also indicate whether Airman is  applying for retirement in lieu of demotion. 6.4.1.5.2.  Member  must  have  completed  at  least  20  years  of  active  duty  service  by the 1st day of the 4th month after the initial notification date of demotion. 6.4.1.5.3.  Member  must  apply  for  retirement  within  3  working  days  of  receipt  of demotion  notification memorandum,  or the demotion  will take effect  as  the date the demotion  authority  approved  the  demotion.  The  unit  commander  may  approve,  in writing, an extension of time to submit the retirement application.  See paragraph  6.6. and contact AFPC/DPSOR for additional instructions on applying for and processing an application for retirement in lieu of demotion. 6.4.1.6.  Makes sure the  Airman endorses the demotion  when he or she  receives it. The Airman must agree or disagree within 3 working days. 6.4.1.7.  Informs  the  Airman  that  if  he  or  she  does  not  agree,  statements  may  be presented, orally or written, within 3 work days after receiving this.  The unit commander may approve extensions, in writing. AFI36-2502  12 DECEMBER 2014 67 6.4.2.  The Initiating Commander: 6.4.2.1.  After receiving the Airman's acknowledgment, the commander decides whether or not to terminate the demotion action or continue processing it. 6.4.2.2.  If  the  commander  terminates  the  demotion  process,  he  or  she  needs  only  to inform the Airman. 6.4.2.3.  If the commander decides to continue processing the demotion action, he or she notifies the affected Airman of the decision in writing. The commander summarizes the written  or  oral  statements,  and  sends  the  entire  case  file  to  the  servicing  MPS  for processing. 6.4.3.  Demotion Authority: 6.4.3.1.  The  demotion  authority  can  take  additional  grade  reductions  other  than  the initiating  commander's  recommendation.  Request  a  written  legal  review  from  the servicing staff judge advocate (SJA) before deciding the demotion. Return the entire case file to the Airman's servicing MPS. 6.4.4.  MPS: 6.4.4.1.  The  MPS  informs  the  Airman's  unit  commander,  in  writing,  of  the  demotion decision and gets the Airman's written acknowledgment.  (T-3) 6.4.5.  The Commander: 6.4.5.1.  Informs the Airman that his or her current grade is retained if the demotion is not approved.   (T-3) 6.4.5.2.  Informs  the  Airman  of  the  grade  to  which  he  or  she  is  demoted,  including  the DOR and the effective date.  (T-3) 6.4.5.3.  Informs  the  Airman  that  he  or  she  must  acknowledge  the  decision  within  3 working days.  (T-3) 6.4.5.4.  Informs  the  Airman  that  he  or  she  can  appeal  the  demotion  to  the  appellate authority within 3 working days.  (T-3) 6.4.6.  The Airman: 6.4.6.1.  Acknowledges receipt by endorsing the document. 6.4.6.2.  Includes the date. 6.4.6.3.  Indicates if he or she will appeal the decision. 6.5.  How  to  Process  an  Appeal.  The  MPS  forwards  the  case  to  the  demotion  authority  for review.    The  demotion  authority  can  reverse  the  previous  decision  and  restore  the  Airman’s original  grade, or forward the case to  the appellate authority without comment.  If the  appellate authority  approves  the  appeal,  the  appellate  authority  directs  the  MPS  to  restore  the  Airman’s previous grade and revoke demotion orders. 6.6.  How  to  Apply  for Retirement.  An Airman eligible for voluntary retirement as set out in paragraph  6.4.1.5.2  can  elect  to  “retire  in  lieu  of  demotion.”    The  requested  effective  date  of retirement  will  be  no  later  than  the  1st  day  of  the  4th  month  following  the  date  the  Airman received the initial  demotion  notification.  An application to  retire in  lieu of demotion  must be 68 AFI36-2502  12 DECEMBER 2014 processed approval/disapproval. to  Secretary  of the  Air  Force  Personnel  Council (SAFPC) for final 6.6.1.  An application to retire in lieu of demotion is not submitted through vMPF.  Airmen apply to retire in lieu of demotion using a hardcopy AF 1160.  When an Airman submits an AF Form 1160 to retire in lieu of demotion, all demotion action stops until SAFPC acts on the retirement application.  Contact AFPC/DPSOR for additional instructions on applying for and processing retirement in lieu of demotion application.. 6.6.2.  The  demotion  process  is  terminated  if  SAFPC  approves  the  retirement  in  lieu  of application.    If  SAFPC  disapproves  the  retirement  in  lieu  of  application,  the  demotion process continues. 6.7.  Grades to Demote Airmen. 6.7.1.  Demote  a  SrA  or  higher  no  lower  than  Airman  First  Class  (A1C).    EXCEPTION:  Airmen under paragraph  6.3.1. can be demoted to the grade of AB. 6.7.2.  Demote an A1C no lower than Amn. 6.7.3.  Demote an Amn to AB. 6.7.4.  Demote by three or more grades only when no reasonable hope exists that the Airman will ever show the proficiency, leadership, or fitness that earned the initial promotion. 6.8.  How to Determine the DOR. 6.8.1.  DOR for Airmen demoted under paragraph    6.3.1.  is  the first date served in  reduced grade (i.e., original date of rank). 6.8.2.  DOR for Airmen who are demoted under paragraph  6.3.2 is the original date of rank and the effective date is the date the commander approves the demotion. 6.8.3.  DOR for Airmen demoted under paragraphs  6.3.3. through  6.3.5. is the effective date of the demotion action (i.e., the date the demotion authority approves the demotion). 6.8.4.  AFDW/A1P  determines  the  DOR  for  Airmen  demoted  under  paragraphs    6.3.6.  and  6.3.7. 6.9.  When to Announce and Revoke Demotions. 6.9.1.  Publishing  Orders.  The  MPS  publishes  orders  after  the  demotion  authority  (not  the appellate  authority)  approves  the  demotion,  but  not  earlier  than  4  working  days  after  the Airman acknowledges it.  Forward one copy of each demotion order under this instruction to AFPC/DPSOE. 6.9.2.  What  to  do  if  the  Airman  is  Eligible  to  Retire  in  Lieu  of  Demotion.  Publish  orders only  if  the  Airman  does  not  submit  an  application  for  retirement  within  3  working  days following acknowledgment (not including the date of acknowledgment). 6.9.2.1.  Stop  demotion  proceedings  for  an  Airman  who  applies  for  retirement  pending the outcome of the application. 6.9.2.2.  If SAFPC turns down the application for retirement in lieu of demotion, publish the  demotion  orders  after  the  demotion  authority  approves  the  demotion.    The  effective date and DOR of the demotion are the approval date of the demotion. AFI36-2502  12 DECEMBER 2014 69 6.9.3.  Revoking  Demotion  Orders.  Revoke  demotion  orders  and  restore  the  Airman’s original  grade,  DOR  and  effective  date  if  the  demotion  authority  determines  that  the  order was published without basis of authority. 6.10.  How  to  Publish  Demotion  Orders.  The special order series is  “AA” for administrative demotions. 6.10.1.  The MPS: 6.10.1.1.  Gets written confirmation of verbal order as soon as possible. 6.10.1.2.  Publishes the administrative demotion special order. Include: 6.10.1.2.1.  Grade, name, SSN, unit, major command, and address of unit. 6.10.1.2.2.  Grade  from  which  he  or  she  was  demoted,  showing  that  the  grade  was permanent. 6.10.1.2.3.  Grade  to  which  he  or  she  is  demoted,  showing  that  the  grade  is permanent. 6.10.1.2.4.  Effective date and DOR of the grade demoted to. 6.10.1.2.5.  Paragraph under which the Airman was demoted. EXAMPLE:  Demotion of  An  Airman:  SSGT  OZZIE  R.  TOOLE,  123-45-6789,  56th  Logistics  Support Squadron  ACC,  Langley  AFB  VA,  is  demoted  from  permanent  grade  of  SSgt  to permanent grade of SrA effective and with date of rank 15 August 1992.  Authority:  AFI 36-2502, paragraph  6.3. (Reference sub-paragraph referring to specific demotion reason). 6.10.1.2.6.  Why  orders  were  not  requested  in  advance.  EXAMPLE:    The  verbal orders  of  the  commander  on  (date)  are  confirmed;  circumstances  prevented  written orders in advance. 6.10.1.3.  Distributes  the  demotion  order  to  the  individuals  and  organizations  on  the order. 6.10.1.4.  Forwards  one  copy  of  the  demotion  order  to  AFPC/DPSIRR,  550  C  Street West, Suite 21, Randolph AFB TX 78150-4723 for ARMS. 6.11.  The Demotion Authority: 6.11.1.  Directs  revoked  demotion  orders  published  under  this  instruction  if  the  appellate authority determines that demotion action is inappropriate.  EXAMPLE: Paragraph 4.10. of Special  Order  AA-141,  this  HQ,  10  August  1992,  purporting  to  demote  SSGT  EARL TRAVER,  123-45-6789,  this  HQ,  to  grade  of  SrA,  which  has  been  determined  by Commander,  AETC,  to  be  without  original  basis  and  null  and  void,  is  revoked.  Authority: AFI 36-2502, paragraph 6.3. (reference sub-paragraph referring to specific demotion reason). 6.11.2.  Retains  demotion  orders  if  the  Airman’s  grade  is  restored  according  to  paragraph  6.1.6.  6.12.  Documenting Demotion Actions.  The MPS: 70 AFI36-2502  12 DECEMBER 2014 6.12.1.  Updates  the  demotion  in  the  personnel  data  system  (MilPDS)  according  to  the Enlisted  Promotions  PSD  guide  immediately  after  the  demotion  authority  (not  appellate authority) approves the demotion.  (T-3) 6.12.2.  Sends  a  copy  of  the  entire  case  file  to  AFPC/DPSIRR,  550  C  Street  West  Ste  21, Randolph AFB TX 78150-4723 to have documents scanned into ARMS.  (T-3) 6.13.  Dual  Status  Airmen.  Airmen can also hold a commission as an officer in the Air Force Reserve.   If demoted, the MPS forwards the completed demotion report with  the commander’s termination  of  appointment  (AFI  36-3209,  Separation  and recommendation  regarding Retirement Procedures for Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve Members), directly to HQ Air  Reserve  Personnel  Center  (ARPC),  Separations  Branch  (DPTTS),  18420  E.  Silver  Creek Avenue, Bldg 390 MS68, Buckley AFB, CO 80011. AFI36-2502  12 DECEMBER 2014 71 Chapter 7 TOTAL FORCE SPECIAL PROMOTION PROGRAMS 7.1.  Promoting RegAF Airmen in Missing Status  .  For Airmen declared “missing in action” (MIA)  or  “prisoner  of  war”  (POW),  the  MPS  forwards  the  unit  commander's  promotion recommendation or nonrecommendation to ARMS for inclusion in member’s electronic record, forwards a copy to AFPC/DPSOE, determines promotion eligibility using Table 2.1, and waives all  other  requirements.    The  AFPC  Commander  (Executive  Director  in  the  Commander's absence)  determines  promotion  for  these  Airmen.    AF/A1PP  determines  promotion  for  other categories of Airmen declared in a missing status. 7.1.1.  AFPC/DPSOE: 7.1.1.1.  Promotes  recommended  Airmen  in  the  grades  of  A1C  and  below  when  they meet TIG and TIS requirements in paragraphs  2.1. and  2.2.  (T-0) 7.1.1.2.  Considers  SrA  through  SMSgt  for  promotion  during  the  first  or  next  normally scheduled  cycle  based  on  the  TIG  and  TIS  eligibility  requirements.    The  Airman's  TIG and TIS must meet or exceed the average TIG and TIS phase points for those selected in their  AFSC  or  CEM  code.    Selects  those  meeting  or  exceeding  TIG  and  TIS  for promotion, if recommended by the unit commander, and assigns a PSN.  (T-0) 7.2.  Promoting  RegAF  Medal  of  Honor  Recipients.  AFPC/DPSOE  automatically  promotes Medal  of  Honor  recipients  one  grade  unless  they  currently  serve  in  the  grade  of  CMSgt.    The effective date is the 1st day of the month following the date of the order.  If the Airman is on a promotion selection list, the effective date of the additional promotion is the 1st day of the month following the normal selection list promotion. 7.3.  Promoting RegAF Prior-Service Airmen  and Former Officers  . AFPC/DPSOA (Skills Management Branch) initially classifies Airmen and identifies their skill-level on entry to active duty.  NOTE:  Initial classification and later skill-level upgrade are the only basis for satisfying the skill level requirement in Table 2.1. However, those personnel in the grades of SrA through TSgt  returned  to  duty  in  an  AFSC  skill  level  that  does  not  make  them  eligible  to  test  for promotion (SrA = 5 level, SSgt = 5 level, and TSgt = 7 level) are authorized a DIERT date equal to their EAD.  The DIERT date will expire 24 months from their EAD. 7.4.  Promoting  RegAF  Airmen  During  Declared  National  Emergency  or  War  .    The  Air Force uses Title 37, U.S.C., Section 201; DoDD 1304.20; War and Mobilization Plan, Volume 1 (WMP-1),  Annex  G;  Deputy  Chief  of  Staff  for  Manpower  and  Personnel  (DCS/P)  Emergency Actions Book (EAB) to determine enlisted promotions under emergency or war conditions. 7.4.1.  The  Air  Force  Combat  Operations  Staff/Contingency  Support  Staff,  Military Personnel Readiness Center (AFCOS/CSS MPRC), with AFPC Personnel Readiness Center (PRC), implement instructions by priority message.  Use the staff guidance and preformatted messages outlined in the DCS/P EAB whenever possible. 7.4.2.  AF/A1PP may: 7.4.2.1.  Suspend  existing  promotion  programs  and  accelerate  existing  promotion increments to meet emergency wartime grade requirements. 72 AFI36-2502  12 DECEMBER 2014 7.4.2.2.  Initiate a decentralized system of temporary promotions.  The selection authority is the MAJCOM commander, who may further delegate this authority.  See Table 2.1. for minimum TIG and TIS at the time of promotion to determine eligibility. 7.4.2.3.  Select  Airmen  on  a  best-qualified  basis  subject  to  limitations  or  requirements specified by the MAJCOM commander.  HQ USAF specifies any changes from current eligibility  requirements.    Make  promotions  to  fill  vacancies  (unit,  wing  commander,  or MAJCOM, depending on the level  promotion authority delegated) in  approved wartime grade  requirements.    Reservists  mobilized  from  the  inactive  status  list  and  recalled retirees must serve a minimum of 6 months continuous active duty following recall to be eligible for promotion.  The DOR for promotion will equal the effective date. 7.5.  RegAF Wounded Warrior (AFW2) Program. 7.5.1.  Promotion to SSgt, TSgt and MSgt will use the following procedures: 7.5.1.1.  Once  awarded  RI  9W200  IAW  36-2101,  AFPC/DPSOE  will  consider  AFW2s for promotion provided they are promotion eligible and they WAPS test. The status of RI 9W200  will  be  verified  by  AFPC/DPSOE  through  AFPC/DPF  prior  to  the  testing window  for  each  cycle.  The  AFW2s  will  compete  for  promotion  with  other  Air  Force-wide  Specialty  Knowledge  Test  (SKT)  exempt  Airmen;  testing  only  on  the  Promotion Fitness  Examination  (PFE).    At  any  time  an  AFW2  may  decline  their  SKT  exemption, they will be required to take the SKT commensurate within their most recent Control Air Force Specialty Code (CAFSC); SKT exemption elections will be annotated on AF Form 1566. 7.5.1.1.1.  For  Promotion  to  MSgt,  regardless  of  testing  status,  the  AFW2  selection record will meet the central evaluation board and compete for promotion among other AFW2s.  In the event  an AFW2 is selected for promotion, AF/A1 must approve the promotion action prior to public release. 7.5.1.2.  The  MPS/TCO  must  provide  a  copy  of  the  AFW2’s  AF  Form  1566  to AFPC/DPSOE  for  them  to  make  appropriate  changes  in  WAPS/WIRE.    Once  the promotion test has been administered, the decision (to elect PFE only, or PFE and SKT testing) cannot be reversed.  NOTE:  When there is not an SKT for the specialty, then all Airmen in that AFSC compete for promotion together, regardless of their status, testing on the Promotion Fitness Examination. 7.5.1.3.  AFPC/DPSOE will assist the AFW2’s nearest MPS to schedule testing and help meet the AFW2’s testing needs, IE., if physically incapable of WAPS testing alone,  yet desiring to test.  MPS will contact AFPC/DPSOE for additional guidance and approval. 7.5.1.4.  DELETED 7.5.2.  Special promotion considerations to SSgt and TSgt. 7.5.2.1.  To  ensure  AFW2s  are  considered  for  promotion  and  are  promoted  along  with their  peers,  the  following  promotion  procedures  will  apply  if  the  AFW2  is  promotion eligible, but cannot WAPS test as documented by a medical authority due to catastrophic injuries.    A  catastrophic  injury  is  defined  as  a  permanent,  severely  disabling  injury, disorder,  or  disease  that  compromises  the  Service  Member’s  ability  to  carry  out  the activities  of  daily  living  to  such  a  degree  that  the  Service  Member  or  Veteran  (SM/V) AFI36-2502  12 DECEMBER 2014 73 requires  personal  or  mechanical  assistance  to  leave  home,  bed,  and/or  requires  constant supervision  to  avoid  physical  harm  to  themselves  or  others.    The  medical  authority’s documentation identifying a SM/V with a catastrophic injury must be processed through AFPC/DPF commander  promotion recommendation  with  wing  commander  approval  must  accompany  the  medical authority’s documentation.   Additionally,  unit to  AFPC/DPSOE. 7.5.2.1.1.  AFPC/DPSOE  considers  each  AFW2  (if  unable  to  test  as  documented  by competent medical authority) for promotion based on RI 9W200 and select them for promotion upon reaching the average TIG of selectees in their CAFSC.  The AFW2 must be eligible for promotion and meet minimum eligibility requirements as outlined in Table 2.1 to be considered for promotion 7.5.2.1.2.  AFPC/DPSOE  verifies  AFW2  promotion  eligibility  and  ensures individuals meet the minimum TIG and TIS requirements.  If the AFW2’s TIG as of the  most  recent  PECD,  meets  or  exceeds  that  of  selectees  in  their  most  recent CAFSC,  the  AFW2  is  eligible  for  promotion  consideration  by  AF/A1.    If  approved for  promotion,  the  DOR  and  effective  date  will  be  the  first  day  of  the  month following  AF/A1  written  promotion  approval.    AFPC/DPSOE  will  make  promotion approval notification to the AFW2’s wing and unit commander. 7.5.2.1.3.  DELETED 7.5.3.  Promotion to MSgt, SMSgt, and CMSgt will use the following procedures: 7.5.3.1.  Once  awarded  RI  9W200,  AFPC/DPSOE  will  consider  the  AFW2  for promotion. Regardless of testing status, if the AFW2 is promotion eligible their selection record will meet the promotion evaluation board and compete for promotion among other AFW2 personnel in their respective grade using WAPS eligibility factors.  AFW2’s who are  declared  fit  to  test  and  meet  the  promotion  evaluation  board  will  be  considered  for evaluation board separately from those AFW2’s who only meet the evaluation board and who  are  declared  unfit  to  test.    If  the  member  is  the  only  promotion  eligible,  the promotion evaluation board will determine if the member is fully qualified.  AF/A1 and AF/CCC through AF/A1P, will approve promotion results for AFW2 MSgt, SMSgt, and CMSgt selects prior to public release. 7.5.4.  Rare and exceptional cases may be considered as an exception to this policy by AF/A1 with AF/CCC coordination. 7.5.5.  Eligible  Airmen  may  receive  promotion  consideration  in  multiple  grades  while  they are participating in the AFW2 Program. 7.5.6.

The MAJCOM/FOA/DRU A1 sends promotion recommendations to ARPC/DPAA for staffing to    AF/RE  for  approval/disapproval.    Promotion  recommendations  for  AF/RE  Promotion Authority must arrive at ARPC/DPAA not later than the 10th  day of the month proceeding the  month  the  promotion  is  effective.    ARPC/DPAA  verifies  grade  ceilings  for  SMSgt  and CMSgt promotions, processes RSC contracts for MSgt through CMSgt promotions, updates MilPDS, and prepares and distributes promotion orders.  For those Airmen not recommended the  AF/RE  lines  through  the  name(s)  of  Airmen  not  recommended  for  promotion,  and annotates the reason for non-recommendation on the form/roster, and notifies the Airmen in writing. 8.9.  Air Force Reserve Stripes for Exceptional Performers II (STEP II).  STEP II authorizes promotion  of  outstanding,  well-deserving  Airmen  one  grade  over  the  Unit  Manning  Document 82 AFI36-2502  12 DECEMBER 2014 (UMD) position grade to which assigned; or members in a higher graded position who are being blocked for promotion who are otherwise eligible can be considered for STEP  II.   Note: PIRR while not assigned to a position are eligible for STEP II. 8.9.1.  Members must meet the following criteria for STEP II consideration: 8.9.1.1.  Meet  eligibility  requirements  as  outlined  in  Table  8.2,  with  the  exception  of being in a higher graded position.  This requirement does not apply to PIRR.  However, a member in a higher graded position blocked for promotion who is otherwise eligible for promotion is also eligible to be considered for STEP II. 8.9.1.2.  Have no unexcused absences within the preceding 12 month period. 8.9.1.3.  Be  nominated  by  the  immediate  supervisor  and  have  first  endorsement  by  the unit commander or designated representative. 8.9.1.4.  Not be an AGR. 8.9.2.  A  member  may  be  promoted  no  more  than  one  grade  over  the  authorized  position grade.    Since  PIRR  do  not  occupy  a  position  with  an  authorized  grade,  only  one  STEP  II promotion is allowed while in the PIRR. 8.9.3.  STEP II promotion boards will be held annually, with a promotion effective date of 1 October. 8.9.4.  STEP  II  promotees  will  be  assigned  overgrade  code  L,  and  will  be  leveled  by  the squadron, group, wing commander, or PM as soon as possible.  PIRR members, while not in a UMD position, require the code to identify a STEP II promotee. 8.9.4.1.  When a STEP  II promotee is  reassigned to  a position of equal  or higher  grade, remove overgrade code L from the system. 8.9.5.  Do  not  use  STEP  II  promotions  when  computing  vacancies  for  unit  vacancy promotions. 8.9.6.  A central  board process  at  ARPC/DPA determines promotions to  the grades of TSgt through CMSgt. 8.9.7.  AFRC/A1 establishes yearly promotion quotas as approved by AFRC/CC or designee. 8.10.  Airmen mobilized under Title 10, U.  S.C. Section 12304 (Presidential Reserve Call Up) or  Section  12302  (Partial  Mobilization  compete  for  promotion  within  the  normal  Reserve promotion program. 8.11.  Reserve  Service  Commitment.  Promotion  to  the  ranks  of  MSgt,  SMSgt,  and  CMSgt require 2-years of retainability.  If the Airman is unable to obtain the full 2-year retainability, he or she is not authorized the promotion to the next higher grade.  This is not waiverable.  The unit forwards  the  RSC  contract  to  the  MPS,  if  applicable  for  Unit  Reservists,  or  IR/RIO  for IMAs/IRRs for updating and distribution.  (T-0). 8.12.  Publishing Promotion Orders.

All eligibility requirements stated in paragraph 8.3 Eligibility Requirements, apply as well as the information listed in this Table. Local promotion boards are not authorized to select enlisted members for unit vacancy promotions.  The Promotion Authority may solicit input from supervisors/chain of command officials.  The Promotion Authority makes final decision on the promotion approval.  For Airmen not recommended for promotion, the commander annotates the reason for non-recommendation and notifies the individual in writing. Promotion effective date is the first day of the month except for promotions to E-2 through E-4.  The effective date for those grades is the date in which all eligibility conditions are met. (This note applies to all Rules, i.e. Rule 1 – 8 of Table 8.2.)  2.  The Promotion Authority may waive the PAFSC skill level requirement for Airmen performing in a Special Duty Identifier (SDI, for example: SDI 8R000 Recruiter).  On reassignment from duty in SDI, Airmen must qualify for the skill level required in Column B, within the time limits specified in AFI 36-2201, Volume 3, Air Force Training Program, On-the-Job Training Administration. (T-0).  3.  Airmen must complete basic military training. TIG for Airmen enlisted in the grades of AB, Amn, or A1C begins on the date the Airman entered IADT. (T-0).  4.

Demotions are administrative and apply to Reserve Airmen in the ranks of Amn through CMSgt.  Do not use demotions actions when action under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) is jurisdictionally authorized and when punitive action is more appropriate. 9.1.1.  Do not demote Airmen who have separated. 9.1.2.  Initiate  administrative  demotion  action  during  the  term  of  enlistment  in  which  the reason(s) for the action first occurred, unless the facts and circumstances are not discovered until the next enlistment period. 9.1.3.  If the commander has sufficient  reason to  initiate demotion  action, use the Airman’s entire military record in deciding whether demotion action is appropriate. 9.1.4.  When appropriate, give an Airman an opportunity to overcome his or her deficiencies before demotion action is initiated. Commanders should maintain supporting documentation of all rehabilitation and probationary actions. 9.1.5.  Do not suspend administrative demotions.  However, for those Airmen who have been recalled to Active duty under 10 U.S.C. 12310, if the demotion  authority  decides to  restore the Airman’s original grade following demotion, he or she must do so sometime  between 3 and 6 months after the effective date of the original demotion.  Restoring an Airman’s earlier grade should be an uncommon occurrence.  The effective date and the date of rank in such cases are the date on which the demotion authority approves restoration in writing. 9.1.6.  Do not reassign an Airman for whom a demotion is in process until after completing the  demotion.    If  an  Airman’s  participation  is  unsatisfactory,  consider  demotion  before reassigning  or  separating  the  Airman.    Demote  Airmen  to  grades  in  accordance  with paragraph 9.10. 9.2.  Demotion  Authority.  For  Airmen  serving  in  the  ranks  of  Amn  through  MSgt,  the commander  in  the  chain  of  command  succeeding  the  initiating  commander  is  the  demotion authority. 9.2.1.  For voluntary demotion under paragraph 9.3., the Wing commander is the Demotion Authority.  For IR/RIO personnel, the demotion authority is the IR/RIO commander. 9.2.2.  For Airmen in the ranks of SMSgt and CMSgt, AFRC/CC is the demotion authority.  The demotion authority may be delegated to NAF or equivalent level commanders in writing but may not be further delegated except for demotion cases that fall under paragraph 9.2.1. 9.2.3.  For  Airmen  serving  on  10  U.S.C.  12310  tours  (except  recruiters  and  Air  Guard Reserve (AGR), the AFRC/A1 is the demotion authority. 9.2.4.  For AFRC Recruiters, AFRCRS/CC is the demotion authority. 9.2.5.  For Airmen assigned to the following categories, the demotion authority is ARPC/CC: PAS  S7  Personnel  including  Non  Participating  IRR,  Inactive  Status  List  Reserve  Section, Ready  Reinforcement  Personnel  Section  (RRPS)  and  Non-Affiliated  Reserve  Section (NARS) (Key Federal Employees).  This may be delegated to ARPC/DPTSC. AFI36-2502  12 DECEMBER 2014 89 9.2.6.  For  Individual  Mobilization  Augmentees  (IMAs)  and  Participating  Individual  Ready Reservists  (PIRRs)  who  are  in  the  rank  of  MSgt  and  below,  the  member’s  immediate commander initiates demotion action, and the demotion authority lies with IR/RIO/CC. 9.2.7.  For  IR/RIO  assigned  staff  members  including  AGRs,  ARTs,  IMAs  and  PIRRs assigned to IR/RIO, its detachments and OLs, the IR/RIO/CC is the demotion authority. 9.3.  Reasons for Voluntary Demotion. 9.3.1.  Demote Airmen when they volunteer for reassignment to a position with an authorized grade below what they currently hold.  If the Airman accepts reassignment to a lower grade, the Airman confirms such acceptance in writing as follows:  “The lower grade [state grade] with DOR of [list DOR in accordance with AFI 36-2604, Service Dates and Dates of Rank] is accepted.”  Advise the Airman that the demotion action will not preclude promotion under Chapter 8 of this instruction. 9.3.2.  For Airmen who apply for an Air Reserve Technician (ART) position that has a lower grade, the following process applies: 9.3.2.1.  The  initiating  commander  forwards  a  copy  of  the  Airman’s  application memorandum to the servicing MPS directing the demotion. 9.3.2.2.  The  MPS  publishes  a  demotion  order  after  receiving  the  Airman’s  acceptance statement. 9.3.2.3.  The  losing  MPS  ensures  that  the  Airman  receives  and  signs  the  voluntary demotion statement before issuing orders or updating MilPDS. 9.3.3.  For  Airmen  who  apply  for  positions  other  than  ART  positions,  including  submitting any  applications  for  voluntary  recall  to  extended  active  duty,  the  losing  MPS  publishes demotion orders. 9.3.4.  For an Airman assigned to AGR positions the MPS forwards the signed statement and the  last  two  promotion  orders  to  ARPC/DPAA.    ARPC/DPAA  forwards  the  package  to ARPC/PBO for update and publication of the demotion order. 9.3.5.  For  an  Airman  reassigned  from  a  nonparticipating  Reserve  section  to  an  AFRC  unit position,  the  gaining  MPF  forwards  the  signed  statement  to  ARPC/DPSRA,  6760  E. Irvington PL, Denver CO 80280-3200. 9.3.6.  Reorganization  or  Mission  Change.  When  an  Airman’s  position  is  downgraded, unfunded or eliminated because of a command or Air Force organization or mission change, the  overgrade  Airman  will  receive  a  waiver,  take  a  voluntary  demotion,  retrain,  or  accept reassignment  to  a  nonparticipating  reserve  section.    Ensure  that  these  actions  comply  with this instruction and AFI 36-2115, Assignments Within the Reserve Components. 9.4.  Reasons for Involuntary Demotion. 9.4.1.  Unsatisfactory Participation in Reserve Training.  Demote unsatisfactory participants holding  a  grade  higher  than  Amn.    (NOTE:    After  five  unexcused  absences  (Category  “A” unit  program)  or  one  unsatisfactory  participation  year  (Category  “B”  IMA  or  category  “E” PIRR), the commander sends the Airman a certified memorandum, return receipt requested, stressing the seriousness of the situation and advising the demotion action is being initiated.  The demotions will be effected as soon as practicable after the Airman has been provided the 90 AFI36-2502  12 DECEMBER 2014 opportunity to exercise his or her rights as defined in the memorandum advising of the intent to  demote.    The  demotion  action  must  be  completed  prior  to  separating  the  Airman).    For demotion purposes only: 9.4.1.1.  For  Category  “A”  reservists,  unsatisfactory  participation  is  defined  as  accruing five  or  more  unexcused  periods  from  scheduled  Unit  Training  Assemblies  (UTAs)  (4 hours per  UTA period)  within any  continuous 12-month period.  Prior to demotion,  the unit  must  have  complied  with  the  provisions  of  AFI  36-2254VI,  Reserve  Personnel Participation,  paragraph  4.14.2,  by  making  every  reasonable  effort  to  locate  the  absent Airman during each scheduled UTA period in which the Airman has been absent. 9.4.1.2.  For  Category  “B”  IMA  s  and  Category  “E”  PIRR  reservists,  unsatisfactory participation is based on their FY obligation as defined in AFI 36-2254VI ,Table 1.1. and paragraph 1.3.2.1 and  1.3.2.2. (one unsatisfactory participation year).  After confirmed unsatisfactory year, initiate notification procedures as defined in paragraph 9.4.1. 9.4.2.  Failing  to  Fulfill  NCO  Responsibilities.    Demote  Airmen  who  do  not  fulfill noncommissioned  officer  (NCO)  responsibilities  under  AFI  36-2618,  The  Enlisted  Force Structure.  In the demotion memorandum, site the specific reasons regarding how the Airman did not fulfill NCO responsibilities and the applicable paragraphs of AFI 36-2618. 9.4.3.  Failing to Complete Training.  Demote an Airman to the previous grade if the Airman was promoted as an officer trainee under AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program, or AFI 36-2013,  Officer  Training  School  (OTS)  and  Enlisted  Commissioning  Programs(ECPS)  or because the Airman was expected, and failed, to complete other training. Demote Non-Prior Service Airman to the rank of A1C prior to reclassification or separation. 9.4.3.1.  The commander of the relevant Armed Forces school demotes officer trainees or pipeline students eliminated from training to the grade previously held. 9.4.3.2.  For  an  Airman  attending  Armed  Forces  schools  in  a  TDY  status,  the  school commandant  informs  AFRC  if  his  or  her  student  status  terminates.    The  Airman’s commander takes appropriate action to demote the Airman to the grade previously held.  NOTE: Delay the demotion when an Airman would lose authorization to ship household goods, move dependents, or both, until he or she arrives at the new duty location or TDY station.    The  losing  MPS  includes  a  cover  memorandum  or  notes  on  PCS  orders  that  a demotion  is  pending  against  the  Airman.    The  gaining  commander  completes  demotion action  using  the  effective  date  as  the  date  when  the  Airman  arrives  at  the  new  duty location. 9.4.4.  Failing to Achieve or Maintain Skill Levels.  Demote Airman if he or she: 9.4.4.1.  Does not achieve or maintain a current skill level appropriate to his or her grade. 9.4.4.2.  Was  promoted  or  enlisted  with  a  PAFSC  waiver  and  does  not  qualify  for  the PAFSC award at the indicated skill level. 9.4.4.3.  Was  reclassified  to  a  skill  level  below  the  awarded  AFSC.    See  AFI  36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted).  Demote the Airman to the highest possible grade for the reduced skill level. 9.4.4.4.  Failed  to  qualify  in  the  specialty  for  which  he  or  she  was  trained  or  is  being trained.    Prior  to  demoting  an  Airman  for  failure  to  qualify  (e.g.,  two-time  Career AFI36-2502  12 DECEMBER 2014 91 Development Course failure), unit leadership must have complied with the rehabilitative provisions of AFI 36-2201. 9.4.5.  Failure to Keep Fit. 9.4.5.1.  Airmen may be demoted when, after entry into the fitness program, they do not maintain fitness standards as outlined in AFI 36-2905, Fitness Program.  Specifically, an Airman may be demoted if he or she fails to attain or maintain Air Force fitness standards after three unsatisfactory tests.  If an Airman has been administratively demoted in grade, and  is  still  failing  to  make  satisfactory  progress,  the  unit  commander  must  make  a recommendation  to  the  wing  commander  to  retain  or  initiate  separation  action  of  a member  on  his  or  her  fourth  fitness  failure  and  each  subsequent  unsatisfactory  fitness test. 9.4.5.2.  Airmen  may  be  demoted  for  failing  to  maintain  or  demonstrate  the  ability  and willingness to attain physical standards. 9.5.  Who  Notifies  the  Airman  of  Demotion  Action.  The initiating commander consults with the servicing SJA and informs the Airman in person or by certified mail, return receipt requested, of the intention to recommend demotion, or to demote. 9.5.1.  The  memorandum  will  (see  Attachment  13  for  example  demotion  letter  without prejudice, see Attachment 14 for example demotion letter with prejudice):  (T-0). 9.5.1.1.  Contain specific reasons and a complete summary of the supporting facts. 9.5.1.2.  Contain instructions for acknowledging receipt of the notification memorandum within 30 calendar days. 9.5.1.3.  Notify the Airman that, if he or she disagrees with the proposed action, he or she may  submit  a  statement,  and  can  request  a  personal  hearing  before  the  initiating commander. Advise the Airman that he or she must pay all travel and other expenses for a personal hearing. 9.5.1.4.  Advises  the  Airman  that  he  or  she  may  seek  legal  counsel,  military  or  civilian (civilian at  the Airman’s own expense).  Provides the name and number  of the Reserve Area Defense Counsel, who can assist with written and oral statements. 9.5.1.5.  Inform the Airman (if eligible) of the right to apply for retirement in-lieu of the demotion.  If retirement is approved, the Airman must retire not later than the 1st day of the 4th month after the first demotion notification. 9.6.  Processing  Demotions.  The  Airman  acknowledges  receipt  of  the  demotion  notification memorandum  within  30  calendar  days  of  receipt.    The  Airman  should  indicate  if  he  or  she concurs or non-concurs, and may submit an application to retire in-lieu-of the demotion, if he or she qualifies. 9.6.1.  At the end of the 30 calendar day period (or sooner if the Airman responds before the end of the 30 calendar days), the following actions occur. 9.6.1.1.  Airman Concurs.  After receiving the Airman’s acknowledgement, the initiating commander forwards the entire case file to the servicing MPS (IR/RIO/DP for IMAs or PIRRs) for processing by the demotion authority. 92 AFI36-2502  12 DECEMBER 2014 9.6.1.2.  Airman  Non-concurs.    The  Airman  can  submit  materials,  or  request  a  personal hearing,  or  both.    The  initiating  commander  considers  all  materials  presented  by  the Airman  before  recommending  further  action  to  the  demotion  authority.    The  initiating commander notifies the  Airman, in  writing, of the decision to  continue or terminate the demotion. 9.6.1.3.  Airman Applies for Retirement.  If the Airman elects to apply for retirement, the effective date of retirement will be the 1st day of the 4th month after the first demotion notification.    The  Airman  must  submit  the  retirement  application  no  later  than  30 calendar days after the demotion action was initiated to avoid publication of the demotion orders. The retirement application is processed in compliance with AFI 36-3203, Service Retirements.  The demotion process terminates if the retirement application is approved.  The demotion process continues if the retirement application is disapproved. 9.6.1.4.  No Response.  If the Airman does not respond, process the demotion as if he or she concurs; the demotion action goes to the demotion authority.  The demotion package will state that the Airman was provided the opportunity to submit statements, but that he or she has not done so. 9.6.2.  Demotion  Action  Continues.    The  initiating  commander  writes  a  summary  of  the personal  hearing  (if  any),  which  becomes  a  part  of  the  case  file.    He  or  she  forwards  the entire  case  file  to  the  servicing  MPS  (or  IR/RIO  for  IMAs/PIRRs)  for  processing  by  the appropriate demotion authority.  The demotion authority obtains a written legal review from the servicing SJA before making a final demotion decision. 9.6.3.  Demotion  Authority  Approves  the  Demotion.    The  demotion  authority  notifies  the Airman’s  servicing  MPS  by  letter.    The  MPS  (IR/RIO  for  IMAs/PIRRs),  endorses  the demotion authority’s memorandum and sends it to the initiating commander. 9.6.3.1.  The initiating commander informs the Airman in writing by certified mail or in-person of the grade to which he or she is demoted, to include the date of rank (DOR) and effective date. 9.6.3.2.  The initiating commander informs the Airman that he or she must acknowledge receipt of the demotion decision within 30 calendar days and indicate to the MPS/CC (or IR/RIO/CC for IMAs/PIRR) whether he or she intends to appeal the final decision, or, if eligible,  submit  an  application  to  retire  in  lieu  of  the  demotion  to  avoid  publication  of demotion orders.  (T-0). 9.6.3.3.  The Airman acknowledges receipt of the memorandum within 30 calendar days by  endorsing  the  memorandum  to  include  the  date  he  or  she  acknowledges  receipt, indicating  he  or  she  will  appeal  the  decision  and,  if  he  or  she  intends  to  submit  an application, to retire in lieu of demotion as applicable. 9.6.4.  Demotion Authority Disapproves the Demotion.  The demotion authority writes to the Airman’s  servicing  MPS  or  to  IR/RIO,  as  applicable.    The  authority  notifies  the  Airman through  the  initiating  commander  by  endorsing  the  document.    For  IMAs/PIRRs,  the demotion  authority  notifies  the  Airman  through  the  member’s  IR/RIO,  Program  Manager and/or Airman’s active duty commander. 9.7.  How to Appeal  . AFI36-2502  12 DECEMBER 2014 93 9.7.1.  Demoted  Airmen.    A  demoted  Airman  must  state  his  or  her  intention  to  appeal  in writing. 9.7.2.  USAFR  Unit  Assigned.      Members  will  submit  any  written  appeals  to  the  servicing MPS commander within 30 calendar days after acknowledging the final demotion decision, unless the initiating commander authorizes an extension. 9.7.2.1.  The  servicing  MPS  commander  sends  the  case  file  to  the  demotion  appellate authority.  The demotion appellate authority obtains a written legal review before acting on the appeals. 9.7.2.1.1.  For USAFR enlisted members in grades Amn through MSgt, AFRC/CV is the demotion appellate authority (unless AFRC/CV has delegated demotion authority to someone subordinate to their position of AFRC/CV). 9.7.2.1.2.  For  USAFR  enlisted  members  in  the  ranks  of  SMSgt  and  CMSgt,  the AFRC/CC  is  the  demotion  appellate  authority  (unless  AFRC/CC  has  delegated demotion authority to someone subordinate to their position of AFRC/CC). 9.7.3.  IMAs  and  Participating  Individual  Ready  reserve  (PIRR)  will  submit  an  appeal through the initiating commander to the Program Manager.  This action must be sent by the member  to  the  demotion  authority  within  30  calendar  days  after  acknowledging  the  final demotion decision, unless there is an authorized delay from the initiating commander.  The demotion authority sends the case file to the appellate authority. 9.7.4.  Notification  procedures.    When  the  appellate  authority  disapproves  the  Airman’s appeal, the servicing MPS or IR/RIO notifies the Airman in writing, via command channels, and the initiating commander endorses the notice. 9.7.5.  Appeal Approval.  When the appellate authority approves the appeal, he or she directs the servicing MPS or IR/RIO to restore the Airman’s grade and revoke the demotion order.  Through the initiating commander, the MPS or  IR/RIO sends  a memorandum  notifying the Airman that the appellate authority approved the appeal and that the Airman’s previous grade was restored. 9.8.  How  to  Apply  for  Retirement.  An  Airman  eligible  to  retire  may  elect  to  apply  for “retirement  in-lieu-of demotion.”  The  effective  date of retirement will be no later than the 1st day of the 4th month after initial notification of demotion action.  The retirement application is processed in compliance with AFI 36-3209. 9.8.1.  When  an  Airman  submits  an  application  to  retire  in-lieu-of  demotion,  all  demotion action stops until the authorities act on the retirement application. 9.8.2.  The retirement application is processed in compliance with AFI 36-3203. 9.8.2.1.  The demotion process terminates if the retirement application is approved. 9.8.2.2.  The demotion process continues if the retirement application is disapproved. 9.9.  Determining Date of Rank (DOR).  MPS are required to ensure they comply with AFI 36-2604  when  completing  an  adjusted  DOR  for  members  who  are  voluntarily  demoted.    Use  the adjusted  DOR  for  Airmen  demoted  voluntarily  under  paragraph  9.3.    Determine  the  DOR  of Airmen demoted involuntarily under paragraph 9.4 in accordance with AFI 36-2604.

The  fact  a  member  meets  each  of  the  eligibility  criteria  outlined  in  this instruction does not automatically guarantee promotion to the next higher grade.  Meeting minimum eligibility criteria only indicates that a member can be considered eligible for promotion.  Promotion  is  not  a  reward  for  past  performance,  but  recognition  of  the member’s potential to successfully serve in the higher grade. 10.1.1.2.  A promotion recommendation must be based upon a period of time sufficient to permit  a  substantive  evaluation  of  the  airman's  total  performance.    An  essential  part  of this evaluation includes the airman's attendance at Unit Training Assemblies (UTA) and Annual  Training  (AT).    Before  recommending  promotion,  the  commander  must  also ensure  that  the  airman's  duty  performance  and  training  progress  clearly  indicate  the member’s potential to serve at the higher grade. 10.1.1.3.  In  the  Noncommissioned  Officer  (NCO)  grades,  particular  emphasis  must  be placed on demonstrated technical skills, present and future supervisory skills, willingness to accept more responsibility and leadership potential. 10.1.1.4.  Each promotion to TSgt and above must be considered in light of its impact on the  unit  and  state  force  management  plans  in  addition  to  the  immediate  and  long  range potential of the member to serve in the higher grade. 10.1.1.5.  When  assessing  a  member’s  potential  to  assume  the  next  higher  grade, commanders  should  refer  to  AFI  36-2618,  Enlisted  Force  Structure,  for  responsibilities of the specific enlisted tier and grade. 10.1.2.  Authority. 10.1.2.1.  The  authority  to  promote  ANG  airmen  as  Reserves  of  the  Air  Force  is delegated  to  The  Adjutant  General  (TAG)  of  the  State  or  Territory  in  accordance  with policies and procedures established by this instruction. 10.1.2.2.  The authority to promote through the grade of TSgt may be delegated to wing or equivalent commanders. 10.1.3.  Wing  or  equivalent  commanders  may  further  delegate  this  authority  to  each individual group, unit or squadron commander. 10.1.3.1.  The authority to approve promotions to the grades of MSgt, SMSgt, and CMSgt is  TAG.    TAG  may  delegate  authority  to  promote  airmen  in  these  grades  to  the  State Assistant  Adjutant  General  for  Air  (AAG  for  Air).  However,  the  AAG  for  Airman delegate  this  authority  to  the  State  Director  of  Staff  (DoS).    This  authority  cannot  be delegated below the DoS.  There will be no exceptions to this policy. 10.1.4.  First Sergeants or immediate supervisors will not have promotion authority. 96 AFI36-2502  12 DECEMBER 2014 10.1.5.

Position  Vacancy  Promotion  (PVP).    For  the  purpose  of  this  instruction,  a  position vacancy  is  a  personnel  assignment  condition  in  which  the  total  number  of  valid  manpower 104 AFI36-2502  12 DECEMBER 2014 positions in a unit (by AFSC and grade) does not exceed the number of personnel assigned to a unit in the same AFSC and grade (to include overgrade assignments in a higher grade in the same AFSC). 10.3.1.1.  Eligibility  . 10.3.1.2.  Airman must meet all eligibility requirements as defined in Table 10.1. 10.3.1.3.  For promotions above the  grade of SSgt,  a position vacancy  must  exist in  the specific AFSC in the grade to which promotion is contemplated, and the individual must be the sole occupant of that valid manpower position. 10.3.2.  Process. 10.3.2.1.  Unit  commanders  will  forward  their  recommendation  through  their  servicing FSS no earlier than 30 days prior to the requested effective date.  This allows sufficient lead-time for administrative processing for promotion recommendation. 10.4.  Mandatory  Promotion  Requirements  for  promotion  to  Amn,  A1C  and  SrA  while attending a lengthy Technical Training School  (TTS). 10.4.1.  Eligibility. 10.4.2.  An AB, Amn or A1C attending a lengthy technical training school in excess of 139 days (BMT length not included) who has not had sufficient time or training to upgrade to the appropriate  3-skill  level  may  be  promoted  while  at  technical  training  school  provided  all other criteria in Table 10.1 has been met. 10.4.3.  Their  military  and  technical  training  school  scholastic  record  must  be  at  least satisfactory and the Airman must demonstrate leadership potential by being an Airman leader or in a signified leadership position by the wearing of an Airman rope (chapel assistant, drill team, band or special activities team). 10.4.4.

To  verify  military  and  TTS  scholastic  records,  the  promotion  approving authority  at  the  unit  will  contact  the  Base  Education  Training  Manager  (BETM)  within  the    servicing  FSS.  The  BETM  must  contact  the  ANG  Liaison  at  the  appropriate  TTS center approximately 60 days prior to the member’s eligibility for promotion. 10.4.5.2.  The promotion recommendation will not be processed by the unit until receipt of the approved promotion checklist. 10.4.5.3.  Under  no  circumstances  will  a  member  be  promoted  prior  to  completion  of each of the requirements above.   In the event a member is erroneously promoted prior to arrival  at  TTS,  the  state  will  revoke  the  erroneous  promotion  action.    No  waivers  or exceptions to this policy will be authorized. 10.5.  ANG Stripes for Exceptional Performers Promotions Program (TSgt – MSgt)  [STEP I].    This  program  was  developed  to  provide  a  promotion  opportunity  only  for  those  highly qualified  and  most  deserving  based  on  demonstrated  potential.  ANG STEP I  promotions  AFI36-2502  12 DECEMBER 2014 105 must  be  reserved  for  a  very  limited  number  of  truly outstanding and deserving members who have demonstrated potential for positions of increased responsibility.  A  deserving  airman  promotion  is  not  a  reward  for  past  service,  nor  is it authorized solely due to an airman’s attainment  of  the  minimum  eligibility  requirements.    This    program    allows  members  to  be promoted to TSgt or MSgt without regard to the UMD authorized grade.  A force management plan  must  be  in  place  so  that  promotions  under  the  STEP  I  do  not  prevent  the  promotion  of eligible  NCOs,  occupying  valid  vacancies,  under  the  unit    vacancy  promotion  program.    This program does not apply to members serving on a full-time Statutory Tour. 10.5.1.  Eligibility. (All of the non-waiverable criteria must be met) 10.5.2.  The airman must be the sole occupant of a UMD position with an authorized grade identical to their current grade (e.g., a TSgt being considered for deserving airman promotion to  MSgt  must  be  the  sole  occupant  of  the  TSgt  position,  no  waivers  or  exceptions).    The airman must be immediately assigned to the first available compatible UMD position (must be equal to or higher to their STEP I grade) that will resolve the overgrade status. 10.5.3.  The airman must be fully qualified in the Duty Air Force Specialty Code (DAFSC)  to which assigned. 10.5.4.  The  promotion  must  not  result  in  the  airman  becoming  senior  in  grade  to  their immediate supervisor. 10.5.5.  The  airman  must  meet  the  requirements  listed  in  Table  10.1.  in  addition  to  those listed in Table 10.3 (STEP I)  This also applies to AGR promotions under this program. 10.5.6.  Airmen  previously  involuntarily  demoted  from  the  grade  of  TSgt  or  MSgt  are  not eligible for promotion under the STEP I promotion program. 10.5.7.  Airmen  previously  promoted  under  this  program  may  not  be  deserving  airmen promoted to the same grade. 10.5.8.  Promotions  resulting  from  this  program  must  be  within  the  manning  constraints  of ANGI 36-2101. 10.6.  Process. 10.6.1.  The ANG STEP I promotion will not to be used as a substitute for position vacancy promotions. As this promotion action will cause an overgrade assignment, commanders must have a force management plan in effect to resolve this condition by the member’s ETS or 24 months, whichever is less. 10.6.2.  Commanders must objectively evaluate and rank order all ANG STEP I nominees so that only truly deserving airmen are promoted. Table 10.3.  Supplemental Mandatory Requirements for ANG STEP I Promotions Promotion to the grade of Status The minimum TIS is and must have served in the ANG for a minimum time of 106 TSgt Military Technician or  Traditional Guard AGR MSgt Military Technician or  Traditional Guard AGR AFI36-2502  12 DECEMBER 2014 24 months  (2 years) 36 months  (3 years) 144 months  (12 years)  of Satisfactory Service for retirement 144 months  (12 years)  of Total Active Federal Military Service (TAFMS) 216 months  (18 years)  of Satisfactory Service for retirement. 216 months  (18 years) TAFMS 10.7.  Officer Training Promotion Program (OTPP). 10.7.1.  Promote  airmen  in  grades  SrA  and  below  accepted  for  the  Academy  of  Military Science  (AMS)  or  the  Flight  Screening  Program  (FSP)  to  SSgt  without  regard  to  the requirements listed in Table 10.1 or UMD authorization.  Such promotions will be effective 1 day before departure, but  no earlier than the 11th day before the established report no later than date to training. 10.7.2.  Airmen  who  eliminated  or  not  commissioned  will  be  demoted  to  their  previously held grade concurrent with termination of their student status in accordance with Chapter 11 of this instruction. The DOR will be the former DOR.   The effective DOR will be the date of the demotion action. 10.8.  Retraining  Promotion  Program  (RPP).  This  program  was  developed  to  provide commanders the ability to recommend promotion for airman who are new to the career field but have demonstrated the ability to serve in the next higher grade 10.8.1.

Airman must meet all eligibility requirements as defined in Table 10.1. 10.8.4.  Any airman who is  retraining may be promoted on the basis of his or her currently held PAFSC, subject to the following: AFI36-2502  12 DECEMBER 2014 107 10.8.5.  The  airman  must  be  fully  qualified  in  the  previous  AFSC,  be  approved  by  the commander  for  retraining,  and  obtain  a  3-skill  level  in  their  current  DAFSC  prior  to promotion recommendation. 10.8.6.  Process. 10.8.6.1.  Airman  must  be  accepted  by  the  unit  commander  into  a  valid  UMD  position vacancy. 10.8.6.2.  Airman must sign the statement of understanding (Attachment 5). 10.8.6.3.  Unit  commanders  will  forward  their  recommendation,  including  member’s completed statement of understanding through their servicing FSS no earlier than 30 days prior to the requested effective date.  This allows sufficient lead-time for administrative processing for promotion recommendation. 10.8.6.4.  Failure to Meet Requirement of RPP. 10.8.6.5.  Airmen promoted under RPP will retain the grade if, for reasons beyond their control,  the  AFSC  into  which  they  have  retrained  is  deleted  (e.g.,  NGB  Directed  Unit Realignment or Reorganization, not a commander directed reassignment). 10.8.6.6.  Airmen promoted under this provision  will be demoted to  the previously held grade in accordance with Chapter 11 of this instruction under the following conditions: 10.8.6.7.  Voluntarily leave the AFSC in which being retrained. 10.8.6.8.  Involuntarily reassigned by a commander for documented and/or substantiated performance related reasons. 10.8.6.9.  Voluntarily  separate or retire before attaining the required grade/skill level. 10.8.6.10.  Fails  to  obtain  the  required  skill  level  by  the  time  limit  approved  by  the commander. 10.9.

Airman may be promoted on the basis of his or her currently held PAFSC and be approved by the commander for retraining prior to promotion recommendation. 10.9.2.  Process. 10.9.2.1.  The unit must have a new Unit Manning Document for conversion in place 10.9.2.2.  Airman  must  be  accepted  by  the  unit  commander  into  a  valid  UMD  position vacancy. 10.9.2.3.  The member must have a request for a 3 level Technical Training School (TSS) on file. 108 AFI36-2502  12 DECEMBER 2014 10.9.2.4.  Airman must sign the statement of understanding (Attachment 5). 10.9.2.5.  Unit  commanders  will  forward  their  recommendation,  including  member’s completed  statement  of  understanding  and  a  copy  of  the  3  level  TSS  request    through their  servicing  FSS  no  earlier  than  30  days  prior  to  the  requested  effective  date  of promotion.  This allows sufficient lead-time for administrative processing for promotion recommendation. 10.9.2.6.  Failure to Meet Requirement of RPP Due to Unit Conversion 10.9.2.7.  Airmen promoted under RPP due to unit conversion will retain the grade if, for reasons  beyond  their  control,  the  AFSC  into  which  they  have  retrained  is  deleted  (e.g., NGB  Directed  Unit  Realignment  or  Reorganization,  not  a  commander  directed reassignment). 10.9.2.8.

All  requests  must  contain  the  appropriate  source document to support the request for correction. 10.12.1.1.  The  (DOR)  of  an  airman  promoted  to  a  grade  not  previously  held  is  the effective date of the promotion. 10.12.1.2.  The DOR of airmen previously demoted as a result of a voluntary change of assignment will be adjusted upon promotion to give credit for previous time satisfactorily served  in  that  grade.      For  example,  a  prior  Master  Sergeant  who  voluntarily  accepted demotion to Staff Sergeant would have his or her date of rank adjusted to give credit for previous time upon promotion again to Technical Sergeant and Master Sergeant. 10.13.  Orders.  Promotions are announced using an AF IMT 2096, or composed special orders (examples in  figure 10.2) published by the  FSS or other orders issuing authority in  accordance with ANGI 33-101, Air National Guard Administrative Orders.

General. 11.1.1.  Program Objective. 11.1.1.1.  Do  not  use  administrative  demotions  when  it  is  more  appropriate  to  take actions specified under the applicable state military code or the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), when applicable. 11.1.1.2.  Do  not  demote  airmen  who  have  separated.    An  administrative  demotion action  cannot  be  initiated  unless  the  reason  for  the  action  occurred  during  the  current enlistment (including extensions).  EXCEPTION: The facts and circumstances were not known  by  the  commander  until  after  reenlistment.    If  the  commander  has  sufficient reason  to  initiate  the  demotion  action,  consider  the  entire  military  record  in  deciding whether demotion is appropriate. 11.1.1.3.  When  appropriate,  airmen  will  be  given  an  opportunity  to  overcome  their deficiencies  before  demotion  action  is  initiated.    Commanders  will  maintain  supporting documentation of all rehabilitation and probationary actions 11.1.1.4.  Suspended  demotions  are  not  authorized  under  this  instruction.      Once demoted, that action reflects the member’s appropriate grade and may not be suspended conditioned on future conduct. 11.1.1.5.  Other  than  demotion  under  paragraphs  11.1.4.1.1.,  11.1.4.1.2.,  11.1.4.2.1, 11.1.4.2.2.,  to  authorize  demotion  of  an  enlisted  ANG  member,  the  demotion  authority must be convinced by a preponderance of the evidence that such action is warranted.  The demotion  authority  may  consider  all  matters  in  the  case  that,  in  their  judgment,  have probative value and need not be influenced by the possibility that some of those matters may not be admissible in a judicial proceeding. 11.1.2.  Authority.  The unit commander may recommend the demotion of an enlisted ANG member under his/her command. 11.1.2.1.  Unit  Level  Airmen.    The  authority  to  demote  enlisted  ANG  members  as Reserves of the Air Force is vested in The Adjutant General (TAG) of the State according to  the  policies  and  procedures  stated  herein.    TAG  will  exercise  demotion  authority  for enlisted  members  serving  in  the  ranks  of  Master  Sergeant  (MSgt),  Senior  Master Sergeant (SMSgt), and Chief Master Sergeant (CMSgt).  This authority may be delegated to the Assistant Adjutant General (AAG) for Air.  (T-0) 11.1.2.1.1.  Demotion  authority  for  enlisted  ANG  members  serving  in  the  ranks  of Technical Sergeant (TSgt) and below may be further delegated to the Wing/ Group/ Base  commander  or  the  commander  of  a  geographically  separated  unit  (GSU),  and may not be further delegated.    (T-3) 11.1.2.2.  Statutory  Tour  Airmen.

(T-0) 11.1.2.3.  Depending on an ANG enlisted member’s military status, a member reduced in grade  by  court  martial,  judicial  or  non-judicial  punishment  under  the  UCMJ  or  State Military  Code,  is  demoted  to  the  same  grade  as  a  Reserve  of  the  Air  Force  in  the  Air National Guard of the United States (ANGUS). 11.1.2.4.  Demotion Reasons 11.1.2.4.1.  Voluntary Demotions. 11.1.2.4.1.1.  Voluntary Change of Assignment. 11.1.2.4.1.1.1.  A  voluntary  change  of  assignment  to  a  UMD  position  which has  a  lower  grade  authorization  than  that  currently  held  by  the  airman  will result in demotion to the lower UMD grade.  Demotions IAW this paragraph is  affected  by  the  publication  of  demotion  orders  by  appropriate  authority.  Orders  affecting  voluntary  demotions  will  contain  the  phrase  “without prejudice.”  There will be no waivers or exceptions to this policy. 11.1.2.4.1.1.2.  Demotion to a lower grade resulting from a voluntary change of  assignment.    An  airman  must  acknowledge  in  writing  that  the  lower military  grade  (state  specific  grade)  is  accepted.    The  demotion  will  not preclude subsequent promotion under Chapter 10 of this instruction. 11.1.2.4.1.2.  Completion of First Sergeant Tour for Full-Time Airmen. 11.1.2.4.1.2.1.  The maximum tour length for full-time personnel serving as a first  sergeant  is  outlined  in  the  appropriate  Air  National  Guard  assignments instruction.  Upon completion of the tour as a first sergeant, the member must be  reassigned  to  a  compatible  military  position.    When  such  a  reassignment (either  prior  to  or  at  the  completion  of  the  maximum  tour)  results  in  a demotion, that demotion will be considered voluntary. 11.1.2.4.1.2.2.  The demotion order will cite this paragraph as the authority for the  demotion.    Orders  effecting  voluntary  demotions  will  contain  the  phrase “without prejudice.” 11.1.2.4.1.2.3.  If  such  reassignment  is  based  on  substandard  performance, demotion would then be effected under 11.1.2.4.2. of this instruction. 11.1.2.4.2.  Involuntary Demotions. 11.1.2.4.2.1.  Failure to Complete Training. 11.1.2.4.2.1.1.

Demote  the  airmen  to  the  highest  grade  that corresponds to the skill level awarded at the time of enlistment. 11.1.2.4.2.2.2.  Reclassification  to  a  lower  skill  level.    Demote  airmen  to  the highest  possible  grade  allowed  for  the  skills  they  have  if,  under  Air  Force Instruction  (AFI)  36-2101,  Classifying    Military    Personnel    (Officers    and Airmen),    Chapter    4,    their    Air    Force  Specialty  is  downgraded  for substandard performance.  As the effective date of demotion, use the date on which their skill level was downgraded. 11.1.2.4.2.3.  Unsatisfactory Participation. 11.1.2.4.2.3.1.  For  demotion  purposes  only,  unsatisfactory  participation  is defined  as  having  six  or  more  unexcused  absences  from  scheduled  unit training assembly [UTA] periods [4 hours per UTA period] in any continuous 12-month period. 11.1.2.4.2.3.2.  After  six  unexcused  absences,  the  commander  may  send  the airman  a  certified  memorandum  (Attachment  12),  return  receipt  requested, stressing the seriousness of the situation and advising that demotion action is being initiated. 11.1.2.4.2.3.3.  The demotion will be effected as soon as practicable after the airman has been given the opportunity to exercise his or her rights as defined in  the  memorandum  advising  of  the  intent  to  demote.    Pending  demotion actions will be completed prior to the administrative separation of Airman. 11.1.2.4.2.4.

Orders  effecting  this  reduction  will  contain  the  statement “without prejudice.” 11.1.2.4.2.5.  Overgrade Assignment Expiration. 11.1.2.4.2.5.1.  When an authorized period of overgrade assignment expires in accordance  with  the  Assignments  instruction  for  the  Air  National  Guard  and no other assignment option is available, the airman must be demoted. AFI36-2502  12 DECEMBER 2014 115 11.1.2.4.2.5.2.  Orders  effecting  this  demotion  will  contain  the  statement “without prejudice”. 11.1.2.4.2.6.  Failure to Fulfill Responsibilities. 11.1.2.4.2.6.1.

Process. 11.1.3.1.  Notifying Airman of Impending Action.  (See Attachment 11 and 12) 11.1.3.1.1.  After  consulting  with  the  servicing  Staff  Judge  Advocate  (SJA),  the immediate commander will inform the airman in writing to the airman’s last known address,  either  by  personal  delivery  (with  written  receipt  acknowledged)  or  by certified mail  (return receipt requested), of the intent  to  recommend demotion, or to demote if the unit commander is also the demotion authority.  If the airman does not acknowledge  receipt  within  the  specified  time  or  if  the  memorandum  is  returned  as undeliverable, the unit commander may proceed to process the demotion action.  The memorandums will contain the following information: 11.1.3.1.1.1.  Specific  reasons  for  the  proposed  action  and  applicable  paragraphs of this instruction. (T-3) 11.1.3.1.1.2.  A complete summary of the supporting facts.  (T-3) 11.1.3.1.1.3.  Instructions  that  the  airman  will  acknowledge  (in  writing)  the notification memorandum within five calendar days of receipt by certified mail or immediately  upon  receipt  if  personally  delivered  by  the  commander  or  his designated representative.  (T-3) 11.1.3.1.1.4.  Instructions  that  the  airman  will  either  concur  or  non-concur,  in writing, with the proposed action no later than the end-of-day roll call following the second UTA (4-hour period) after acknowledgment of the memorandum. 116 AFI36-2502  12 DECEMBER 2014 11.1.3.1.1.5.  An  explanation  that  the  airman  may  consult  with  counsel  before electing to concur or non-concur with a recommendation for demotion.   Counsel will  be  provided  by  the  SJA,  appointed  by  the  airman’s  immediate  commander, and identified by name in the initial notification memorandum.  Counsel may also assist  in  preparing  a  written  response  by  the  individual  if  the  member  so  elects.  Expenses  incurred  in  connection  with  the  appearance  or  assistance  of  civilian counsel on behalf of the airman is the responsibility of the airman and will not be paid  by the  government.   Airmen being  considered for demotion  will be offered representation by counsel who is either: 11.1.3.1.1.5.1.  A  military  lawyer  (within  the  meaning  of  article  27(b)(1)  of the  UCMJ  or  designated  Judge  Advocate  (JA)  under  Title  10  USC  8067(g), different  from  the  military  counsel  advising  the  commander,  if  available;  or  (T-3) 11.1.3.1.1.5.2.  If  a  military  lawyer  is  not  available,  a  disinterested  officer from  the  unit  other  than  the  airman’s  unit.    This  officer  must,  in  the commander’s  judgment,  possess  the  knowledge  and  judgment  necessary  to provide  comprehensive  and  accurate  advice  to  the  airman  on  the  procedures and  alternate  courses  of  action  available.    If  possible,  the  officer  should  be well versed in personnel matters. (T-1) 11.1.3.1.2.  If  the  airman  non-concurs  with  the  proposed  demotion  action  then  he must  decide  whether  or  not  to  submit  documentation  on  his  or  her  behalf.      If  the decision is to submit documentation,  it  must  be  received  within  20  calendar  days  after  the  date  the  airman responds indicating his or her decision to non-concur with the demotion action. 11.1.3.1.3.  An explanation that the airman may request a personal interview with the immediate commander.   If the airman chooses to make an oral presentation, counsel may be present during the interview. 11.1.3.1.4.  Explanation  that  a  lack  of  response  will  be  construed  as  concurrence  by the  individual.  Failure  to  respond  will  be  construed  as  a  waiver  to  both  the  right  to appear before the airman’s immediate commander and representation by counsel. 11.1.3.1.5.  An  explanation  that  the  airman,  if  eligible,  may  request  resignation  or retirement IAW AFI 36-3209, Separation Procedures for Air National Guard and Air Force  Reserve  Members,  in  lieu  of  demotion  at  any  time  before  publication  of demotion orders.  Obligors or airmen who have incurred service commitments are not eligible to resign or retire. 11.1.3.2.  Action by the Immediate Commander after Receipt of Airman’s Reply or if  the  Airman  Fails  to  Respond  to  the  Notification  of  Intent  to  Demote.  (See Table 11.1) 11.1.3.2.1.  If the airman concurs with the demotion action or fails to respond to the notification  of  intent  to  demote,  and  if  the  immediate  commander  is  the  demotion authority, the commander will obtain a legal review of the case file from the servicing SJA.  (T-3) AFI36-2502  12 DECEMBER 2014 117 11.1.3.2.1.1.  If it is determined that the case file is legally sufficient for demotion the immediate commander will proceed with the demotion action.  (T-3) 11.1.3.2.1.2.  If the immediate commander is not the demotion authority, forward the  package  and  demotion  recommendation  through  channels  to  the  appropriate demotion authority.  (T-3) 11.1.3.2.1.3.  If  the  airman  non-concurs  with  the  demotion  action  and  submits matters  on  his  or  her  behalf,  or  requests  a  personal  interview,  or  both,  the immediate commander will consider all matters presented by the airman. 11.1.3.2.2.  An  immediate  commander  who  is  also  the  demotion  authority  will consider each and all of the matters presented and then: 11.1.3.2.2.1.  Terminate the demotion action; or  (T-3) 11.1.3.2.2.2.  Request  SJA  review  for  legal  sufficiency  prior  to  effecting  the demotion.    If  the  SJA    determines    there    is    legal    sufficiency    to    support    a  finding    for    demotion,    the  immediate  commander  may  proceed  with  the demotion action.   If the case lacks legal sufficiency, it will be terminated and the airman advised in writing by certified mail or by personal delivery.  (T-3) 11.1.3.2.3.  An  immediate  commander  who  is  not  the  demotion  authority  will consider each and all of the matters presented and then: 11.1.3.2.3.1.  Terminate the demotion action, or   (T-3) 11.1.3.2.3.2.  Prepare  a  written  summary  of  that  personal  interview  (if  any), include  that  summary  in  the  case  file,  and  forward  the  case  file  to  the  demotion authority  with  an  appropriate recommendation.    The immediate  commander will immediately notify the airman in writing by certified mail or by personal delivery of the decision to continue processing the demotion action or to terminate it.

The    demotion    authority    will    obtain    a    legal    review    from    the  servicing    SJA    before  rendering  a  final  decision  on  the  immediate  commander’s demotion recommendation.    (T-3) 11.1.3.3.2.  The  demotion  authority  will  notify  the  airman  and  servicing  Force Support Squadron (FSS) in writing of the decision to concur or non-concur with the immediate  commander’s  demotion  recommendation.  The  FSS  will  then  notify  the airman of the decision by endorsement through the airman’s immediate commander.  (T-3) 11.1.4.  Administrative Actions. 11.1.4.1.  Announcing and Revoking Demotions: 11.1.4.1.1.  Demotions  are announced in  special  orders published by the  appropriate headquarters in  IAW ANGI 33-101, Air National Guard Administrative Orders. The effective date for the demotion is the date specified by the demotion authority. 11.1.4.1.2.  Demotion orders may be revoked only with the approval of TAG when it has  been  determined  that  the  order  was  published  without  the  proper  authority.  Revocation orders are published in accordance with ANGI 33-101. 11.1.4.1.3.  Instructions  regarding  voluntary  demotions  are  found  in  paragraph 11.1.4.1. 11.1.4.2.  Notifying  the  Airman  of  an  Approved  Demotion  Action.    The  demotion authority  (who  is  not  the  airman’s  immediate  commander)  will  notify  the  airman’s immediate commander in writing through the FSS of the decision to effect the demotion.  The  airman’s  commander  will  then  notify  the  airman  in  writing  by  certified  mail  or personal delivery of the decision.  A copy of the demotion order will be included with the notification.  If the immediate commander is not available,  the  next  higher  commander  in  the  chain  of  command  (up  to  and  including  the demotion authority) will notify the airman. 11.1.4.3.  Grades to Which Airman May be Demoted.  See Table 11.2. Table 11.2.  Grades to Which Airmen May be Demoted R U L E 1 2  If airman is E-4 or higher E-3  then demotion will be to a grade no lower than E-2 E-1 11.1.4.3.1.  A  reduction  of  three  or  more  grades  should  only  be  used  in  an extraordinarily  unique  case  when  there  appears  to  be  no  reasonable  hope  that  the airman will again exhibit the proficiency, leadership, or fitness previously possessed.   In this case, commanders may consider separation or discharge action under AFI 36-3209. 11.1.4.4.  Date of Rank DOR will be determined in accordance with Attachment 10. AFI36-2502  12 DECEMBER 2014 119  DANIEL R.

Statement of Understanding 1.  Because my rank upon entry into The United States Air Force Band is governed by AFI 36-2502, Airman Promotion/Demotion Programs,   I understand that if I no longer meet the performance standards of The USAF Band or if I voluntarily request transfer from AFSC 3N2X1 (3N200), I will be considered for administrative demotion or date of rank (DOR) adjustment.   2.  If demoted, I may be demoted to the average grade held by other Airmen with similar time-in-service (TIS) in the new AFSC, but not below an enlisted grade previously earned under regular promotion programs.  If demoted, my DOR in the grade to which demoted will be determined by the recommendation of the Promotion Propriety Review Board with the concurrence of HQ USAF/A1PP.  3.  I understand that I may not be permitted to retain any grade for which I do not meet the minimum Air Force TIS requirements for consideration under general promotion programs.  These TIS requirements (contained in AFI 36-2502, Table 2.1) are Total Active Federal Military Service of 1 year for SrA, 3 years for SSgt, 5 years for TSgt, 8 years for MSgt, 11 years for SMSgt, and 14 years for CMSgt.    ______________________________________________________________________________ Member’s Printed Name (Last, First, MI)    ______________________________________________________________________________ Witness' Printed Name (Last, First, MI)   Signature Date Signature Date AFI36-2502  12 DECEMBER 2014 127 Attachment 3 ENLISTED PME ATTENDANCE WAIVER FOR PROMOTION Figure A3.1.

Use  the  following  sample  matrix  table  to  compute  the  promotion  opportunities  for  your State.  The authorized/ assigned figures below are for example only and simply demonstrate the arithmetic process. Replace these figures with current authorized/assigned strengths by grade in your  State,  Wing  or  Unit  including  all  over  grades  and  excesses.  Do  not  count  those  members promoted under ANG STEP I and ANG STEP II. Table A4.1.  Sample Matrix Table to Compute the Promotion Opportunities. Grade Authorized Assigned CMSgt SMSgt 10(a) 17(c) 8(b) 18(d) Allowable Percentage (ANGI 36-2101) 100 100 MSgt 25(e) 30(f) TSgt 40(g) 56(h) 120 125 Adjusted Effective Manning Percentages 80% (b divided by a) 96% total of b+d(26)divided by total of a+c (27) 108% total of a+c+e (52) 122% total of b+d+f+h+(112) divided by total of a+c+e+g (92) A4.2.  To determine if the State in this example can promote a member to MSgt, divide the total number  assigned  in  grades  MSgt,  SMSgt,  and  CMSgt  by  the  total  authorized  in  grades  MSgt, SMSgt,  and CMSgt.  In the above example, 56 divided by 52 equals  108%. Since this is  below the  120%  maximum  allowable  for  MSgt,  this  member  may  be  promoted.  To  determine  if  this State  can  promote  a  member  to  TSgt,  we  total  the  authorized  and  assigned  figures  for  TSgt through  CMSgt  and  then  divide  the  total  assigned  (112)  by  the  total  authorized  (92).  The adjusted  effective  manning  percentage  is  122%.  Since  this  is  below  the  125%  maximum allowable for TSgt, this member may be promoted. These percentages must be recomputed with each  promotion  or  demotion,  each  change  in  assigned  strength,  and  each  change  in  authorized strength.  AFI36-2502  12 DECEMBER 2014 129 Attachment 5 ANG - STATEMENT OF UNDERSTANDING--RETRAINING PROMOTION PROGRAM Figure A5.1.
