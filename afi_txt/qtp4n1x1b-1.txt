This qualification training package (QTP) was developed to make available a training aid which will assist Surgical Service Technicians  to develop technical skills essential to performing specialized tasks.  The tasks are broken down into teachable elements, which help the trainer guide the trainee into becoming proficient with the tasks.  The QTP will also aid the task certifier when evaluating trainees for task certification.  2.  As a trainer, go through each module (lesson) and identify which QTP tasks are appropriate for the trainee’s duty position (items identified in the CFETP as core tasks are mandatory), then determine the order in which you want the trainee to learn about each subject area.  Direct the trainee to review the training references to better understand the objective of each module.  Go through the steps in the task performance with the trainee and allow for enough time to learn each step; some objectives may take more time than others.  Remember, the objective of the QTP is to ensure the trainee can perform each task thoroughly.  When the trainee receives enough training and is ready to be evaluated on an objective, follow the evaluation instructions.  Use the performance checklist as you evaluate each objective.  If the trainee successfully accomplishes the objective, document appropriately in the individual’s training record.  If the trainee does not accomplish the objective, review the areas needing more training until the objective is met.  Conduct a feedback with the trainee on each module.  After the trainer has ensured and documented that the trainee is qualified to perform the task, the trainee should be evaluated by a certifier.  3.  The goal of the developers of this QTP is to publish a useful document for trainers and trainees that will meet Air Force needs under the concepts outlined in the Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP).  We value your expertise in meeting this goal. If you find discrepancies in this QTP, or have suggestions for its improvement, or if you have suggestions for other areas that may benefit from a QTP, please let us know about them by contacting the below individual:   MSgt Derrick Weese 59 MDOG/SGCXG 2200 Berquist Ave, Suite 1 JBSA Lackland, TX 78236 DSN 554-5769 Email: derrick.weese@us.af.mil   SMSgt Judy Hickman 60 SGCS/CCC Travis AFB, CA 94535                                                          DSN 799-2385                                                          Email: judy.hickman@us.af.mil    ii  Volume B1         Module 1 PERFORM CLINICAL PROCEDURES CATHETERIZATION OF THE URINARY BLADDER - FEMALE SUBJECT AREA:  TASK(s):  CFETP/STS REFERENCE(s):  TRAINING REFERENCE(s):  EQUIPMENT REQUIRED:  OBJECTIVE:  REMARKS/NOTES: Perform Clinical Procedures  Catheterization of the Urinary Bladder in the Female Patient  19.5.1 Catheterizations  Lippincott Manual of Nursing Practice, 10th Edition  Sterile gloves Disposable sterile catheter kit with single-use packet of lubricant Antiseptic solution Sterile Drape Sterile container for culture  In a clinical setting, perform a catheterization of the urinary bladder in a female patient.  The principal danger of catheterization is urinary tract infection, which is associated with increased morbidity and longer, more costly hospitalization.  Catheterization requires the same aseptic precautions as a surgical procedure. Ensure trainee follows strict aseptic technique.  Use the smallest catheter capable of providing adequate drainage.   EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS:  1.  This QTP should be evaluated during actual performance of the tasks.  2.  After the trainee has received instructions, allow sufficient practice on each part of the task.  The trainee must satisfactorily perform all parts of the task without assistance.  3.  Use the appropriate checklist when evaluating the task to ensure all steps of the task are accomplished.    4.  Document competency upon satisfactory completion of the evaluation.  Initial evaluation should be documented in the Specialty Training Standard (STS).  All recurring evaluation should be documented using AF Form 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training, or using an approved substitute record.  1  Volume B1         Module 1 PERFORM CLINICAL PROCEDURES PERFORMANCE CHECKLIST CATHETERIZATION OF THE URINARY BLADDER – FEMALE  Preparatory Phase 1.

Since approximately 20% of patients who visit a primary physician’s office have a urological problem, it is important for the urology technician to have a broad knowledge of the laboratory methods available to test appropriate specimens and to know that the method of collection may vary depending on the test required   Volume B1   SUBJECT AREA:  TASK(s):  CFETP/STS REFERENCE(s):  TRAINING REFERENCE(s):  EQUIPMENT REQUIRED:     OBJECTIVE:  REMARKS/NOTES: EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS:  1.

List and describe the types of urine specimen commonly requested: a. Clean voided urine specimens are usually adequate for routine examination.  Most patients are able to collect this type of specimen independently.  Routine urine examination is usually done on the first voided specimen in the morning.  At least 10 mL of urine is generally sufficient for a routine urinalysis.     b. Clean catch or midstream urine specimen. This decreases contamination from organisms in the urethra.  Procedure fairly simple for males, difficult for females; involves cleaning urethral meatus and surrounding area, then, avoiding contamination, following procedure for standard mid-stream collection using a sterile specimen container.  The patient passes the first 15-30 mL of the urine stream and collection is obtained after that into a sterile specimen cup.    c. Catheterized specimen.  It is obtained by catheterizing the bladder to obtain a urine specimen which is collected into a sterile container. 2.  Obtain urine specimen, Multistix reagent strips, and color chart. PERFORMANCE PHASE 1.  Wash hands and don clean gloves.  Check reagent strip expiration date on bottle. Note:  Follow manufacturer’s instructions for reagent strip use.  The following instructions/interpretations in this checklist are general guidelines only. 2.  Quickly dip reagent strip into the urine and immediately remove it.  Ensure all chemically impregnated areas are immersed in the urine.  Start timing.     3.  Touch the rim of the urine container with the strip as it is withdrawn from the container. (This removes excess urine.) 4.  Briefly blot the edge of the strip on absorbent paper towel or tissue. 5.  Compare each test pad to the corresponding row of color blocks on the bottle label.        a. read each pad at the time shown on the label, starting with the shortest time.        b. hold the strip close to the color blocks and match carefully      c. read the pads in good light FOLLOW-UP PHASE 1.  List the chemical elements screened for and some possible indications of abnormal/positive results. a. Glucose:  Most patients with a positive reading have diabetes mellitus, which may result in specific urinary tract manifestation such as renal papillary necrosis, recurrent urinary tract infection, or impotence. b. pH:  Freshly voided is normally somewhat acidic.  Alkaline urine may indicate a state of alkalosis, UTI, or a diet high in fruits and vegetables.  A low pH is found in starvation, with diarrhea, or with a diet high in protein foods or cranberries.  Patients with calcium stones, nephrocalcinosis, or both, may have renal tubular acidosis; patients with uric acid stones rarely have a urinary pH over 6.5 c. Protein:  Persistently elevated protein levels in the urine (>150mg/24 hours) may indicate significant disease. d. Hemoglobin:  The dip-strip test for hemoglobin is not specific for red cells, and should be used only to screen for hematuria. e. Blood:  Blood may be present in the urine of patients who have UTI, kidney  10                                                PERFORM MACROSCOPIC URINALYSIS disease, or bleeding from the urinary tract. f. Specific Gravity:  Concentrated urine has a higher specific gravity; diluted urine has a lower specific gravity.   g. Leukocytes:  An increase in leukocytes  in the urine are an indication of pyuria and is found in nearly all diseases of the kidney and urinary tract.
