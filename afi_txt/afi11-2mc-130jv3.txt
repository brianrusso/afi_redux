This Air Force Instruction (AFI) provides operational guidelines and restrictions for  MC-130J  aircraft.    It  is  a  compilation  of  information  from  aircraft  flight  manuals,  Flight Information  Publications  (FLIP)  and  other  Air  Force  directives,  and  is  an  original  source document  for  many  areas.    This  instruction  is  regulatory  in  nature  and  takes  precedence  over guidance  in  Air  Force  Tactics,  Techniques,  and  Procedures  (AFTTP).    Air  Force  Special Operations  Command  (AFSOC)  Standardization/Evaluation  (AFSOC/A3V)  has  overall responsibility for the administration of this volume. 1.2.  Applicability.  This instruction is applicable to all individuals and units operating MC130J aircraft  and  AFSOC  units  operating  Special  Operations  Forces  (SOF)  C-130J  variant  airlift  or tanker aircraft. 1.3.  Key Definitions: 1.3.1.  “Will” and “Shall” indicate a mandatory requirement. 1.3.2.  “Should” indicates a preferred, but not mandatory, method of accomplishment. 1.3.3.  “May” indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment. 1.3.4.  “WARNING”  indicates  operating  procedures,  techniques,  etc.,  which  may  result  in personal injury or loss of life if not carefully followed. 1.3.5.  “CAUTION”  indicates  operating  procedures,  techniques,  etc.,  which  may  result  in damage to equipment if not carefully followed. 1.3.6.  “Note” indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., which are considered essential to emphasize. 1.3.7.

Do not deviate from the policies and guidance in this instruction except when the situation demands immediate action to ensure safety.  The OPR grants waivers only  in  accordance  with  (IAW)  with  this  instruction.    MAJCOMs/DRUs/FOAs  will  forward proposed MAJCOM/DRU/FOA-level supplements to this volume to HQ AFFSA/XOF, through HQ AFSOC/A3V, for approval prior to publication IAW AFPD 11-2.  (T-1) 1.4.1.  Although  this  publication  provides  guidance  for  aircraft  operations  under  most circumstances, it is not a substitute for sound judgment.  When it is necessary to protect the crew and aircraft from a situation not covered by this instruction and when immediate action is  required,  the  Pilot  In  Command  (PIC)  has  ultimate  authority  and  responsibility  for  the course  of  action  to  be  taken.    Report  deviations,  without  waiver,  through  channels  to MAJCOM/A3 within 48 hours, followed by a written report, if requested.  Unless otherwise indicated,  AFSOC/A3  is  the  waiver  authority  for  operational  procedure  requirements contained  in  this  volume.    Request  waivers  through  Standardization/Evaluation  (stan/eval) channels.  (T-2)   14  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 1.4.2.  In  the  absence  of  a  designated  Commander  Air  Force  Special  Operations  Forces (COMAFSOF); the AFSOC/A3 may grant COMAFSOF waiver authority to an individual in writing.  (T-2) 1.4.2.1.  When  waiver  authority  is  delegated,  AFSOC/A3V  will  receive  a  copy  of  all approved waivers.  (T-2) 1.4.3.  This  instruction  is  a  source  document  for  guidance  and  procedures  within  AFSOC.  The  dynamic  nature  of  flying  operations  demands  crew  members  and  mission  planners reference the parent source documents.  Parent source documents are listed in order to ensure the  operators  have  the  most  current  and  accurate  information  available  to  conduct  flying operations.  (T-2) 1.4.4.  Tier requirements refer to waiver authority based on level of risk. 1.4.4.1.  “Tier 0”  (T-0) requirements are reserved for requirements that non-compliance is determined and waived by respective non-Air Force authority. 1.4.4.2.  “Tier 1”  (T-1) requirements are reserved for requirements that non-compliance may  put  airman,  mission,  or  program  strongly  at  risk,  and  may  only  be  waived  by  the MAJCOM/CC  or  delegate  with  concurrence  of  publication  approver.    When  multiple MAJCOMs are affected, then T-1 is appropriate. 1.4.4.3.  “Tier  2”    (T-2)  requirements  are  reserved  for  requirements  that  potentially  put the  mission  at  risk  or  potentially  degrade  the  mission  or  program,  and  may  only  be waived by the MAJCOM/CC or delegate. 1.4.4.4.  “Tier 3”  (T-3) requirements are reserved for requirements that non-compliance has  a  remote  risk  of  mission  failure,  and  may  be  waived  by  the  Wing/CC  but  no  lower than the OG/CC. 1.5.  Distribution. 1.5.1.  All MC-130J aircrew members will maintain a full copy of this instruction.  (T-2) 1.6.  Supplements.  Major  Commands  (MAJCOM)  may  supplement  this  volume  according  to AFI  11-200.    These  supplements  will  not  duplicate  or  be  less  restrictive  than  the  provisions  of this  instruction.    Forward  MAJCOM  supplements  to  AFSOC/A3V  and  Air  Force  Flight Standards Agency (AFFSA)/XOF for approval before publication and provide AFFSA/XOF one copy  after  publication.

(T-2) AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   15  Chapter 2 COMMAND AND CONTROL 2.1.  General.  The  AFSOC  Command  and  Control  (C2)  system  is  based  on  the  principles  of centralized monitoring and decentralized control and execution.  The result is  a C2 mechanism which  keeps  the  AFSOC  Commander  (CC)  informed  of  the  current  status  of  AFSOC  forces while enabling the Wing or Group Commander to exercise control over day-to-day operations. 2.1.1.  Waiver request will be the responsibility of the C2 agency with the operational control of the mission.  Operational waivers will be coordinated through the Stan/Eval channels.  (T-2) 2.2.  Operational  Control  (OPCON).  Absent  an  approved  command  relationship  to  the contrary,  AFSOC  is  designated  as  the  controlling  agency  for  United  States  Special  Operations Command  (USSOCOM)-assigned  Air  Force  SOF  aircraft,  while  Theater  Special  Operations Commands  (TSOCs)  have  OPCON  of  theater-based  assets.    In  practice,  responsibility  for planning  and  executing  AFSOC  missions  is  routinely  delegated  to  the  Wing  or  Group Commander.    The  Wing  or  Group  Commander,  in  turn,  exercises  control  of  non-close-hold missions  through  the  command  post  supporting  the  wing  or  group.    In  the  event  that  assigned forces  undergo  a  Change  in  Operational  Control,  responsibility  for  mission  monitoring  passes from the wing or group C2 facility to the gaining command.  Changeover will be accomplished IAW the pertinent Operational Plan, Operational Order, or deployment or execution order. 2.3.  Waiver and Approval Authorities. 2.3.1.  Wg/CCs or equivalent hold waiver/approval authority for items normally authorized at or below wing level.(T-3) 2.3.1.1.  Deployments. 2.3.1.2.  Air Apportionment Allocation Conference taskings. 2.3.1.3.  Joint Air Apportionment Allocation Conference (JAAAC) taskings. 2.3.1.4.  Joint  Combined  Exchange  Training  (JCET)/Counter  Narcotics  Training missions. 2.3.1.5.  Other  specified  missions  as  tasked  via  the  SOF  Air  Tasking  Order  (ATO)  in SOFAPPS. 2.3.1.6.  CONUS  and  OCONUS  forces  depart  a  Theater  Special  Operations  Command (TSOC)/Joint  Special  Operations  Air  Component  (JSOAC)  Area  of  Responsibility (AOR) en route to United States Northern Command (NORTHCOM) AOR. 2.3.1.7.  ARC forces (under Title 10). 2.3.1.8.  Depart  home  station  for  AFSOC-directed  contingencies/deployments/exercises (under Title 10). 2.3.2.  Operational waivers will be coordinated through Stan/Eval channels.  Waiver requests will  normally  be  the  responsibility  of  the  C2  agency  with  the  operational  control  of  the mission.  (T-2)   16  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 2.3.3.  Wg/CC  OPCON  terminates  when  forces  enter  a  TSOC/JSOAC  AOR  and  picks  up when forces exit a TSOC/JSOAC AOR. 2.4.  Mission  Monitoring.  The  AFSOC  Operations  Center  monitors  all  off-station  AFSOC aircraft  via  Theater  Battle  Management  Core  Systems  (TBMCS)  –  Execution  Status  and Monitoring (ESTAT), the Global Decision Support System (GDSS2), Theater Situation Reports, and aircrew Deployed Status Reports (DSR).  Aircraft equipped with Blue Force Tracker (BFT) devices  are  tracked  near  real  time  via  the  Common  Operating  Picture  (COP).    Inputs  to  these various tracking tools are provided by the C2 agency with OPCON. 2.4.1.  PIC or mission commander flight reporting duties: 2.4.1.1.  Stations With MAF C2 Agency.  Aircrews will provide a  “Thirty Minute” Out Call.    Transmit  a  UHF  or  VHF  arrival  advisory  to  the  destination  C2  agency approximately  30  minutes  prior  to  arrival.    Provide  Estimated  Time  in  Blocks  (ETB).  Local MAF C2 agents will enter mission data (arrival, departure, and advisory messages) in  GDSS2  when  applicable.      Additionally,  aircrews  must  keep  their  controlling  C2 agency  appraised  of  all  actual  takeoff  and  landing  times,  projected  takeoff  times,  and other related information within 30 minutes after landing.  (T-2) 2.4.1.2.  Stations  Without  MAF  C2  Agency.    Transmit  mission  data  (arrival,  departure, and advisory messages) to the controlling C2 agency, within 30 minutes after landing, by any  means  available.    (preference  in  the  following  order:    Defense  Switched  Network (DSN)/  commercial  telephone,  high  frequency  (HF)  phone  patch,  Iridium  Phone).    For critical C2 communications (i.e., aircraft waiver request, maintenance delay, etc.), voice communications are the primary method. 2.4.1.3.  Provide controlling C2 agency with daily DSR. 2.4.1.4.

Designation  of  a  COMAFSOF.  The  Commander,  USSOCOM,  or  Theater  Special Operations Command (TSOC) may designate a  COMAFSOF.  This  should be done in  writing, and  the  designation  letter  will  include  the  individual  by  name,  and  the  geographic  area  of authority.    In  the  absence  of  a  USSOCOM  or  TSOC/CC  designated  COMAFSOF,  AFSOC/A3 may designate an individual with waiver authority equivalent to a designated COMAFSOF.  This must be done in  writing, and the designation letter should include the individual  by  name, and the  geographic  area  of  authority.    The  designation  letter  should  be  updated  to  reflect  any personnel changes as a result of prolonged deployments.  (T-2) 2.6.  Mission  Commander.  A  mission  commander  will  be  designated  when  more  than  one aircraft or crew is deployed away from home station for training, exercises, or other operations.  The mission commander will be rated,  and should be  a field  grade officer.  The mission or  air mission  commander  will  not  be  a  primary  crew  member  for  exercises,  but  may  fly  as  a  crew member  on  non-exercise  related  missions.    Mission  commanders  are  responsible  for  overall mission execution as well as aircraft and personnel  supporting the mission.  Duties include but are not limited to: (T-2) 2.6.1.  Briefing crews on local operating procedures. 2.6.2.  Coordinating with Air Traffic Control (ATC), Combat Control Team (CCT), Special Tactics  Squadron  (STS),  range  control,  users,  and  others  that  may  have  an  impact  on  the mission. 2.6.3.

Airborne  Mission  Commander  (AMC).  The  individual  responsible  for  the  overall employment  of  all  air  assets  assigned  to  the  mission.    Required  for  multi-element,  multi-event formations,  and/or  where  mission  complexity  dictates.    The  AMC  will  not  be  a  primary  crew member and should be on headset.  (T-2) 2.9.  Deputy  Mission  Commander  (DMC).  Required  on  all  missions  employing  a  dedicated AMC,  on  all  multi-element  formation  missions,  and  on  all  single-element  formations  of  three aircraft or more.  The DMC assumes command if conditions prevent the AMC from controlling the  mission.    The  DMC  may  be  a  primary  crew  member,  and  is  usually  the  Formation Commander  on  AMC  controlled  missions.    The  DMC  will  not  be  on  the  same  aircraft  as  the AMC.    On  missions  not  employing  a  dedicated  AMC,  the  DMC  is  chosen  from  the  PICs,  and Combat Systems Operators (CSO) involved in the formation.  (T-2) 2.10.  Mission  Clearance  Decision.  The final  decision to  delay a mission may be made either by the agency with OPCON or the PIC when, in the opinion of either, conditions are not safe to start or continue a mission.  Final responsibility for the safe conduct of the mission rests with the PIC.  If the PIC refuses a mission, it will not depart until the conditions have been corrected or improved so that the mission can operate safely.  Another PIC and aircrew will not be alerted to take the same mission under the same conditions.  (T-2) 2.10.1.  Diverting  or  rerouting  a  mission  must  be  authorized  by  the  commander  with OPCON,  except  in  an  emergency  or  when  required  by  en  route  or  terminal  weather conditions or facilities. In the event of an emergency or weather related divert or reroute, the mission commander PIC must notify the controlling authority as soon as possible.  (T-2) 2.10.1.1.  The  controlling  agency  directing  the  diversion  or  rerouting  is  responsible  for ensuring  destination  requirements  or  facilities  are  adequate  for  the  aircraft  and  aircrew.  (T-2) 2.10.1.2.  The PIC will notify the controlling agency of any aircraft or aircrew limitations that may preclude diverting or rerouting the mission.  (T-2) 2.10.2.  When directing an aircraft to an alternate airfield, the controlling agency will ensure the PIC is provided existing and forecasted weather for the alternate.  If the planned alternate is unsuitable upon arrival at destination, the controlling agency will advise the PIC of other suitable alternates.  (T-2) 2.11.  Civilian  Law  Enforcement  Support.  It  is  the  policy  of  the  Department  of  Defense  to cooperate  with  civilian  law  enforcement  officials  to  the  maximum  extent  practicable.    AFI  10-801,  Defense  Support  of  Civil  Authorities,  incorporates  the  appropriate  directive  and  provides uniform  policies  and  procedures  service  members  must  follow  when  supporting  federal,  state, and local civilian law enforcement agencies.  It establishes specific limitations and restrictions on the  use  of  Air  Force  personnel,  equipment,  facilities,  and  services  by  civilian  law  enforcement organizations.    Report  all  requests  for  assistance  and  coordinate  all  requests  from  civilian  law enforcement authorities through the appropriate C2 channels.

The final responsibility regarding equipment required for a mission rests with the PIC.  If one crew accepts an aircraft to operate a mission or mission segment without an item or system, this acceptance does not commit that crew, or a different crew, to accept subsequent operations with the same item or system inoperative.  When the PIC considers an item essential, designate  the  component  Mission  Essential  (ME)  on  the  Air  Force  Technical  Order  (AFTO) Form  781A,  Maintenance  Discrepancy  and  Work  Document,  and  the  item  will  be  repaired  or replaced prior to departure.  (T-2) 4.2.  Policy.  This chapter provides guidance on how to operate with degraded equipment.  If the PIC  elects  to  operate  with  degraded  equipment  or  aircraft  system(s),  coordinate  mission requirements  (i.e.,  revised  departure  times,  fuel  requirements,  maintenance  requirements,  etc.), prior to flight with the mission control agency to ensure the decision does not adversely impact follow-on missions. 4.3.  Minimum  Equipment  List  (MEL)  Policy.  The  MEL  is  a  prelaunch  document  that  lists the  minimum  equipment/systems  to  operate  the  aircraft  prior  to  takeoff.    It  is  impractical  to prepare  a  list  that  would  anticipate  all  possible  combinations  of  equipment  malfunctions  and contingent  circumstances.  Consider equipment/systems with  no listed  exceptions as  grounding items.    A  PIC  who  accepted  an  aircraft  with  degraded  equipment/systems  is  not  committed  to subsequent operations with the same degraded equipment.  PICs are not committed to operations with degraded equipment accepted by another PIC. 4.3.1.  The  PIC  shall  account  for  the  possibility  of  additional  failures  during  continued operation with inoperative systems or components.  The MEL is not intended for continued operation over an indefinite period with systems/subsystems inoperative.  (T-2) 4.3.2.  All  emergency  equipment  will  be  installed  and  operational  unless  specifically exempted by mission requirements/directives.  (T-2) 4.3.3.  PICs  operating  with  waiver(s)  for  degraded  equipment  shall  coordinate  mission requirements  (revised  departure  times,  fuel  requirements,  and  maintenance  requirements).  (T-2) 4.3.4.  If beyond C2 communication capability, or when it is necessary to protect the crew or aircraft from a situation not covered by this chapter and immediate action is required, the PIC may  deviate.    Report  deviations  (without  waiver)  to  Operations  Group  (OG)/CC  within  48 hours, if requested. 4.4.  Waiver  Protocol.  Waivers to operate with  degraded equipment are granted on a case-by- case basis. 4.4.1.  MAJCOM/A3  or  COMAFSOF  (mission  execution  authority)  is  the  MEL  waiver authority unless designated otherwise in this chapter.  Initiate the request with MAJCOM C2 agency.  (T-2) 4.4.2.  The waiver request will include: 4.4.2.1.  Reason for the request.   26  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 4.4.2.2.  Individual crew member qualifications. 4.4.2.3.  Mission leg(s) requiring the waiver. 4.5.  Technical  Assistance  Service.  The  PIC  may  request  (at  anytime  in  the  decision  process) technical  support  and  additional  assistance  from  their  home  unit,  MAJCOM  staff,  and maintenance representatives. 4.6.  One-Time  Flights.  Refer  to  TO  00201,  Aerospace  Equipment  Maintenance  Inspection, Documentation, Policies, and Procedures, for downgrade authority and procedures. 4.6.1.  One-time  flight  approval  authority  is  OG/CC  or  COMAFSOF.    The  owning Maintenance  Group  (MXG)/CC  (or  designated  official),  the  senior  maintenance  officer,  or the on-site chief of an AFMC repair team must first authorize the release.  PIC concurrence is required before the aircraft can be flown.  (T-2) 4.7.  Fuel  System.  The  primary  concern  with  inoperative  fuel  boost  pumps  or  quantity indicators is fuel balance and wing loading.  Degraded operation is permissible; however, flight crews  must  consider  potentially  trapped  fuel  and  decreased  range  should  further  degradation occur.    This  paragraph  and  the  MEL  provides  guidelines  for  degraded  fuel  system  operations under  most  circumstances.    (T-2)              Note:    Although  the  fuel  quantity  indications  can  be displayed  on  multiple  Heads  Down  Display  (HDD)  System  Status  Displays  as  well  as  on  the hard  panels,  repetitions  in  excess  of  one  indication  per  tank  are  not  relevant.    The  ‘number installed’  includes  one  indication  per  tank  and  the  ‘number  required’  specifies  the  number  of tanks that must have an operative indication.  (T-2) 4.7.1.  In-flight, fuel will not be transferred into or out of a main fuel tank with an inoperative indicator or its symmetrical tank except for the following: (T-2) 4.7.1.1.  Fuel transfer into a main tank with an inoperative indicator may be accomplished during  contingency  or  emergency  fuel  need  situations.    All  transfers,  under  these conditions,  require  more  than  one  crew  member  to  monitor  and  coordinate  the  fuel transfer. 4.7.1.2.  A reliable source of known quantity transferred must be available.  This source can be either the internal aircraft operating fuel quantity indicators or in-flight refueling tanker fuel onload data.  (T-2) 4.7.1.2.1.  Begin  cross-feed  operation  when  the  symmetrically  opposite  quantity indicator has decreased to 1,500 pounds (inboards) and 2,500 pounds (outboards). 4.7.1.3.  Engine  out  training  using  the  engine  corresponding  to  the  inoperative  indicator or its symmetrically opposite will not be conducted during tank to engine operation.  (T-2) 4.7.1.4.  Maintain symmetrical engine fuel flow. 4.7.1.5.  Plan to land with a minimum of 4,000 pounds calculated main tank fuel. 4.7.2.  When an external tank indicator is inoperative and the tank cannot be visually checked empty due to foam modification, comply with the following prior to flight: 4.7.2.1.  Check pressure with each pump in the external tank.  If no pressure is obtained, the tank is verified empty. AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   27  4.7.2.2.  If  pressure is obtained, ground transfer the fuel from the external tank.  Defuel the external tank if unable to ground transfer. 4.7.2.3.  When unable to verify an external tank is empty prior to engine start, place the tank on cross-feed until no pressure is obtained.  This will be completed prior to takeoff. 4.7.3.  Maintain symmetrical tanks within 1,000 pounds at all times.  If small amounts (4,000 pounds or less) must be transferred, then transfer up to 1,000 pounds into the tank with the inoperative  indicator  followed  by  an  equal  amount  into  the  tank(s)  with  operative indicator(s).  If large amounts of fuel must be transferred, then transfer 1,000 pounds into the tank with the inoperative indicator, then up to 2,000 pounds as needed into the tank(s) with the operative indicators, then up to 1,000 pounds as needed into the tank with the inoperative indicator to bring all tanks symmetrical, or continue up to 2,000 pounds as needed, repeating the cycle until desired fuel quantity and balance is achieved in applicable tanks.  (T-2) 4.7.4.  Fuel  may  be  transferred  from  main  or  external  tanks  with  inoperative  fuel  quantity indicators  only  if  the  receiver  requires  emergency  fuel.    In  this  situation,  the  following procedures will apply: 4.7.4.1.  The  fuel  flow  counter  for  the  refueling  pod  being  used  must  be  operational  to track the amount of fuel transferred.  (T-2) 4.7.4.2.  Transfer from only one tank at a time. 4.7.4.3.  Transfer  no  more  than  1,000  pounds  at  a  time  between  the  tanks  with  the inoperative indicator and its symmetrical tank to monitor fuel balance. 4.8.  Landing  Gear  System:  If  a  landing  gear  system  or  position  indicator  malfunction  is encountered, only a full  stop  landing will be made.  The discrepancy  will be corrected prior to the  next  flight.    Exception:    If  repair  capability  does  not  exist  and  a  positive  determination  is made that further flight can be accomplished with the gear down and locked, the aircraft may be flown  to  a  destination  where  repair  capability  exists  provided  the  gear  is  not  moved  from  the down and locked position.  Required en route stops are authorized.  (T-2) 4.9.  Navigation Systems.  Refer to Table 4.14 4.10.  Soft Panel Operations. 4.10.1.  For  partial  or  complete  hard  panel  failures,  aircrews  may  revert  to  soft  panel operations.  Normally, if a soft panel is selected due to hard panel failure, it should be used for the remainder of the flight.  Doing so will mitigate the hazards associated with restoring hard  panel  functionality  for  an  item  when  the  mission  computer  commanded-state  is unknown. the  ENGINE  SHUTDOWN  and  BEFORE  LEAVING AIRPLANE checklists after the aircraft is parked will ensure the soft panel retains control of the  particular  item  throughout  shutdown.    In  all  cases,  PICs  must  consider  the  increased workload associated with using soft panels.  (T-2)   Accomplishing 4.10.2.  Hard panel failures may be the result of a physical failure or loss of communication with  the  Mission  Computer  (MC),  an  aircraft  reboot  may  recover  hard  panel  functionality.  To determine if hard panel functionality can be regained, the following procedures must be followed in sequential order: (T-2)   28  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 4.10.2.1.  Completely  power  down  when  accomplishing  the  BEFORE  LEAVING AIRPLANE checklist. 4.10.2.2.  Complete all checklist items in the POWER UP checklist.  Do not proceed past the  POWER  UP  checklist  until  it  can  be  determined  if  the  hard  panel  has  recovered.  Depending  on  the  system  effected  (such  as  Auxiliary  Power  Unit  (APU),  bleed  air, landing gear, etc.), do not apply bleed air or hydraulics until hard panel functionality can be determined. 4.10.2.3.  To  determine  if  a  hard  panel  has  recovered,  ensure  hard  panel  and  soft  panel selections/settings are identical.   Press  the Line Select  Key (LSK)  to  turn the soft panel OFF.  If a Communication/Navigation/Identification  (CNI) “Check (CHK) HARD PNL” or  a  referenced  hard  panel  fault  Advisory  Caution  and  Warning  System  (ACAWS) message  (i.e.,  “APU  PNL  FAULT”,  “DEF  SYS  PNL  FAULT”,  etc.),  does  not  appear, press the “VERIFY OFF” LSK.  If feasible, check hard panel functionality. 4.10.2.4.  If  a  CNI  “CHK  HARD  PNL”  or  a  referenced  hard  panel  fault  ACAWS message  appears,  the  hard  panel  has  not  recovered.    The  “CHK  HARD  PNL”  message indicates there is a mismatch between the soft panel and hard panel commands to the MC independent of physical switch positions.  Referenced hard panel fault messages are self-explanatory. 4.10.2.5.  If it is determined that the hard panel has not recovered, at the PIC discretion, the  mission  may  continue  to  a  station  supporting  a  repair  capability,  including  en  route stops.  Do not reselect the hard panel.  If a flight must continue under the control of two or more soft panels, a waiver is required.  (T-2) 4.10.3.  After  returning  to  home  station  or  repair  facility  with  a  hard  panel  malfunction, aircrews  will  shut  down  and  turn  the  aircraft  over  to  maintenance  personnel  for  required actions.  (T-2) 4.11.  MEL Table Definitions/Column Identifiers. 4.11.1.  Installed – Number of components or systems installed. 4.11.1.1.  In some cases, a component can be controlled from either a hard panel or from a soft panel.  Similarly, some indications can be viewed on either a hard panel or a soft panel.    Since  switch  functions  (or  indications)  may  be  duplicated  on  each  of  the  three Communication/Navigation/Identification  Management  Unit  (CNI-MU)  displays,  the number  of  switches  (or  indications)  installed  may  not  always  be  clear.    To  clarify  this condition,  switches  (or  indications)  are  listed  as  ‘1’  in  the  installed  column  even  when they are duplicated on a soft panel. 4.11.1.2.  Although the indications on each pilot‘s (HDD) can be repeated on more than one HDD, repetitions of data in excess of one per pilot are not relevant for flight and are not counted in this MEL.  In general, the flight deck is designed to provide one set of data for the pilot  and one set of data for the copilot  (in addition  to the standby instruments).  Thus, for most HDD indications, the number installed is listed as ‘2’ one for each pilot. 4.11.2.  Required – The minimum number (quantity) of items required for operation provided the conditions specified in the remarks or exception column are met. AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   29  4.11.2.1.  Unless  otherwise  noted,  when  the  item  is  a  switch  (or  indication)  which  is duplicated on a soft panel, the number required for dispatch may be satisfied by either the hard  panel  switch  (or  indication)  or  by  the  switch  (indication)  on  one  of  the  associated soft panels.  For HDD indications, the number required is ‘2’ if both pilots must have an indication, ‘1’ if only one pilot must have an indication and ‘0’ if neither pilot is required to have the indication.  For essential flight data (heading, altitude, airspeed, attitude and when required, navigation data), the pilot’s and copilot’s displays must have independent sources.  (T-2) 4.11.3.  Remarks and Exceptions.  Some technical information and procedures are contained in this column.  This is not all-inclusive; crew members shall refer to the flight manual and other directives for procedures, techniques, limitations, etc. Table 4.1.  Air-Conditioning and Pressurization  (T-2).

Flight Plan/Data Verification. 5.8.1.  Computer  Flight  Plan  (CFP):    Use  CFP  as  the  official  source  of  performance, navigation, and climatic data, including en route wind information.  If stand-alone computer based plans are used, each mission segment should utilize best wind data available.  Use only AFSOC validated CFPs. 5.8.1.1.  Use  CFPs  to  the  maximum  extent  practical.    Flight  crews  may  manually compute  flight  plans.    The  PIC  has  final  responsibility  for  flight  plan  accuracy  and diplomatic clearance compliance. 5.8.1.2.  Verify CFPs for route of flight and fuel computation accuracy before departure.  All  waypoint  data  retrieved  from  a  database  should  be  verified  by  one  or  more  of  the following methods: AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   63  5.8.1.2.1.  Latitude/longitude from current FLIP. 5.8.1.2.2.  Bearing/distance from a flight plan. 5.8.1.2.3.  Ground Based NAVAIDs. 5.8.2.  When conducting Drop Zone (DZ)/Landing Zone (LZ) operations, both pilots or one pilot and CSO will verify CNI-MU CARP/LZ information with a valid DZ/LZ survey.  Refer to  AFI 13-217,  Drop  Zone  and  Landing  Zone  Operations for  DZ/LZ  survey information/requirements/applicability.  (T-2) 5.9.  Communications  Security  (COMSEC)  and  Classified  Material.  Obtain  and  safeguard  COMSEC  and  other  classified/keying  material  required  for  the  mission.    Carry  authenticators and  IFF  Mode  IV  codes,  when  flying  into  an  Air  Defense  Identification  Zone  (ADIZ), participating  in  exercises,  on  overseas  missions,  deployments,  and  when  specified  in  operation plans. 5.9.1.  The base COMSEC custodian has access to the AFKAG 44/AFKAG 14 and can assist in  obtaining  the  material  required  for  the  mission.    Squadrons  maintain  the  COMSEC material  used  on  most  missions.    All  squadron  members  that  require  access  to  COMSEC material  will  be  properly  trained.    Base/squadron  COMSEC  Responsible  Officer  (CRO)  is the Point of Contact for current training requirements.  (T-2) 5.9.2.  Command  and  Control  Center  (CCCs)  will  provide temporary  storage  for COMSEC/classified  materials  during  ground  time  at  en  route  stops.    Issue  and  turn-in  of COMSEC is normally a function of the squadron CRO.  (T-2) 5.9.2.1.  Remove  classified/sensitive  information  (such  as  secure  voice/DAMA,  IFF, mission information) stored in all aircraft systems. 5.9.3.  If possible destroy classified material and equipment prior to crash landing or bailout. 5.10.  Briefing  Requirements.  Refer  to  the  appropriate  AFSOC  briefing  guides  for  content. Crew members will not fly unless they attend the crew briefing.  Exception:  When pre-mission requirements  dictate,  PIC  may  excuse  certain  crew  members  from  the  briefing.    The  PIC  will ensure that those personnel receive a face-to-face briefing prior to engine start.  (T-2) 5.11.  Call  Signs.  Use Voice Call Sign Listing  or as specified  in mission directives/tasking for all  missions  except  local  area  training  missions.    Use  squadron  or  wing  static  call  signs  as directed for local area training missions. 5.11.1.  Aeromedical Evacuation.  Preface normal call sign with "AIR EVAC" when patients are on board. 5.11.2.  Search and Rescue.  When tasked to participate in SAR operations, use the call sign "AIR FORCE RESCUE" plus the last five digits of the aircraft tail number. 5.12.  Departure/Arrival  Planning.  Comply  with  AFI  11-202,  Vol  3,  and  AFMAN  11-217, Vol 1, Instrument Flight Procedures.  If using a flight plan furnished by another agency, the PIC and CSO will verify routes and flight altitudes to ensure proper terrain clearance.  (T-2) 5.13.  TOLD Verification Requirement. 5.13.1.  To verify CNI TOLD, both pilots will cross-check CNI TOLD INIT entries.  (T-2)   64  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 5.13.2.  TOLD  ENTRIES  Takeoff  Page  3/4  and  4/4.    For  an  IFR  departure,  aircraft  weight must be less than or equal  to  the calculated maximum aircraft weight  for  the type of three-engine departure listed (normal or 50-flap at obstacle clearance speed).  (T-2) 5.14.  Adverse Weather. 5.14.1.  Flight into areas of forecast or reported severe turbulence is prohibited. 5.14.1.1.  Anytime  wind  shear  may  be  encountered  on  departure  or  approach,  it  is recommended that aircrews select weather mode on one NAV RADAR display and wind shear mode on another NAV RADAR display. 5.14.1.2.  The  PIC  is  responsible  for  ensuring  all  passengers  are  seated,  with  seat  belts fastened,  when  areas  of  moderate  or  greater  turbulence  are  encountered  or  anticipated.     WARNING: Serious injury may occur if passengers do not have their seat belts fastened and the aircraft encounters moderate or severe turbulence. 5.14.2.  Flight  into  areas  of  forecast  or  reported  severe  icing  is  prohibited.    Prolonged operation, such as cruise flight or holding, in areas of moderate icing should be avoided. 5.14.2.1.  Do not takeoff under conditions of freezing rain or freezing drizzle. 5.14.2.2.  Freezing  precipitation,  snow,  freezing  fog  (consider  equivalent  to  moderate icing),  or  temperatures  near  0°  C,  may  cause  ice  or  frost  to  accumulate  on  aircraft surfaces.    When  an  aircraft  requires  de-icing/anti-icing  prior  to  takeoff,  refer  to  the following: 5.14.2.2.1.  Aircrews will only use de-ice and anti-ice fluids listed in their respective flight  manual.    Aircrews  will  be  familiar  with,  and  follow  all  restrictions  in  their associated  flight  manual  with  respect  to  anti-ice/de-ice  procedures  and  holdover times.  (T-2) 5.14.2.2.2.  Military (MIL)-A-8243 Type I and Type II de-icing fluids do not provide any anti- icing benefit, and therefore do not have holdover times. 5.14.2.2.3.  In  all  cases,  PICs  will  ensure  a  visual  inspection  of  the  aircraft  is completed within 5 minutes of departure.  (T-2) 5.14.3.  Do not fly directly above (within 2,000 feet) thunderstorms or cumulonimbus clouds.  If  unable  to  clear  thunderstorms  or  cumulonimbus  clouds  by  at  least  2,000  feet  vertically, avoid them by at least: 5.14.3.1.  20 nm at or above flight level (FL) 230. 5.14.3.2.  10 nm below FL 230. 5.14.3.3.  5 nm for tactical low-level operations.  Avoid gust fronts and winds preceding a rapidly moving thunderstorm.      CAUTION:  Aircraft damage may occur 20 nm or more from  any  thunderstorms.    Aircrews  must  familiarize  themselves  with  information  on thunderstorm  development  and  hazards.    Refer  to  AFH  11-203,  Vol  1,  Weather  for Aircrews.  (T-2) 5.14.4.  The use of ground-based radar as a means of thunderstorm avoidance should only be used to assist in departing an inadvertently penetrated area of significant weather.  It should never  be  considered  a  normal  avoidance  procedure.    When  relying  exclusively  on  ground-AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   65  based radar for weather avoidance, and the ground controller is unable to provide avoidance instructions, attempt to maintain VMC by: 5.14.4.1.  Changing routing. 5.14.4.2.  Diverting to alternate. 5.14.4.3.  Declaring an emergency and requesting priority assistance. 5.15.  Operational Risk Management (ORM).  ORM is a logic based, common sense approach to  making  calculated  decisions  on  human,  material,  and  environmental  factors  before,  during, and after  all operations.  USAF policy  on ORM  is  contained in  Air Force Pamphlet  (AFPAM) 90-902,  Operational  Risk  Management  (ORM)  Guidelines  and  Tools.    PICs  will  accomplish ORM  worksheets  IAW  AFSOC/MAJCOM  and  local  guidance  as  part  of  preflight  activities.  (T2) 5.15.1.  Flying  units  will  develop  a  local  ORM  program  to  include  personal  ORM  risk assessment for all missions.  (T-2) 5.15.2.  The PIC will ensure an ORM risk assessment is accomplished by all crew members as part of preflight activities. 5.16.  AFTO Form 781, Aerospace Vehicle Flight Data Record.  Review the AFTO Form 781 before  applying  power  to  the  aircraft  or  operating  aircraft  systems.    The  Exceptional  Release (ER)  must  be  signed  before  flight.    A  maintenance  officer,  maintenance  superintendent,  or authorized  civilian  normally  signs  the  ER  If  one  of  these  individuals  is  not  available,  the  PIC may sign the ER.   Ensure that the DD Form  1896,  DoD Fuel Identaplate and AIR card are on board the aircraft.  (T-2) 5.16.1.  One-Time Flights.  An aircraft may be released for a one-time flight with a condition that might be hazardous for continued use, provided the aircraft is airworthy for one flight to a repair station.  Refer to TO 00-20-1 for downgrade authority and procedures. 5.16.1.1.  One-time  flight  approval  authority  is  OG/CC  or  COMAFSOF.    The  owning MXG/CC (or designated official), the senior maintenance officer, or the on-site chief of an AFMC repair team must first authorize the release.  The PIC's concurrence is required before the aircraft can be flown.  (T-2) 5.16.2.  Authority to Clear a Red X.  Aircrew are not normally authorized to clear a Red X.  If  a  situation  is  encountered  where  the  aircraft  is  on  a  Red  X  and  qualified  maintenance personnel  are not  available to  clear it, the PIC  may obtain authorization to  clear the Red X from  the  home  station  Maintenance  Group  (MXG)/CC  or  designated  representative,  in accordance with TO 00201. 5.16.2.1.  At  en  route  stations,  loadmasters  are  authorized  to  clear  Red  X  symbols  for; intake  and  exhaust  inspections,  dust  covers  and  plugs  installed,  and  aircraft  panels removed  and  installed  to  facilitate  other  maintenance  when  qualified  maintenance personnel are not available. 5.16.2.2.  In-Process  Inspections.    Loadmasters  must  be  aware  of  their  responsibility  to perform  in-process  inspections  when  clearing  Red  X  symbols.    During  the  assembly where  further  assembly  will  prevent  the  required  inspection  of  the  item,  an  in-process   66  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 inspection will be performed.  The inspection will be documented IAW TO 00-20-1.  (T-2) 5.17.  Forms  Management.  In  addition  to  the  procedures  in  TO  00-20-1  and  AFI  11-401,  the CSO/LM will assist the PIC in maintaining the AFTO Form 781.  Verify the exceptional release is signed before flight and resigned, if necessary, at en route stops. 5.17.1.  After  each  flight,  ensure  the  number  of  discrepancies  (if  any),  landings,  and  flight duration time(s), etc., are entered on the AFTO 781H,  Aerospace Vehicle Flight Status and Maintenance  Document.    Review  all  AFTO  781A  discrepancies  to  ensure  symbols,  date discovered,  and  clear,  detailed  entries  were  entered  and  the  discovered  by  blocks  are completed for each discrepancy. 5.17.2.  IAW,  DoD  Manual  4140.25M  Vol  II,  DoD  Management  of  Bulk  Petroleum Products,  Natural  Gas,  and  Coal;  AFI  23-201,  Fuels  Management;  and  AFI  23-111, Management  of  Government  Property  in  Possession  of  the  Air  Force;  AFMAN  23-110, USAF  Supply  Manual,  Vol.  1,  Pt  3;  and  AFI  11-253  Managing  Off-Station  Purchases  of Aviation Fuel and Ground Services, all off-station fuel purchases (to include FARP and in-flight  refueling)  will  be  logged  on  AFTO  781H  and  AF  Form  664,  Aircraft  Fuels Documentation Log if applicable.  (T-2) 5.17.3.  IAW AFMAN 23-110, Vol 1, USAF Supply Manual, Part 3, Chapter 1, Paragraph 1.26. An aircrew member will record all in-flight transfers from C-130 tanker aircraft to any receiver aircraft on the AF Form  791,  Aerial Tanker In-Flight  Log.  This form  will also  be accomplished for Forward Area Refueling Point (FARP) offloads and fuel jettison in excess of 1,000 lbs.  IAW AFMAN 23-110, Vol 1, USAF Supply Manual, Part 3, Chapter 1, 1.27 and 1.37.  Turn completed forms in during maintenance debrief.  (T-2) 5.18.  Dash One Preflight.  The aircrew Dash One preflight inspection, once completed, is valid for 72 hours provided the aircraft is sealed. 5.18.1.  When  an  aircrew  assumes  a  preflighted  spare  or  quick-turn,  a  thorough  visual inspection will be performed, paying particular attention to areas affected by maintenance or servicing.  (T2) 5.18.2.  Except  to  prepare  for  OREs,  ORIs,  and  contingencies/evacuations,  Dash  One preflight inspections are normally done in preparation for flight by the aircrew assigned to fly the mission designated for that aircraft, that day. 5.18.2.1.  The  following  guidelines  apply  to  aircrew  assigned  to  preflight  and/or  seal aircraft.  A crew should not preflight more than 4 aircraft in a 12-hour period.  Refer to crew  rest/flight  duty  period  guidance  in  AFI  11-202,  Vol  3.    Aircrews  performing preflight duties will be afforded 12 hours rest between preflight shifts. 5.18.2.2.  Duties Not Including Flying crew members may accomplish preflights with the concurrence  of  the  flight  surgeon.    It  is  the  responsibility  of  the  crew  member  to  know his/her duty limitations.  Crew members should have the flight surgeon document the AF Form  1042,  Medical  Recommendation  for  Flying  or  Special  Operational  Duty, appropriately IAW with AFI 48-123, Medical Examinations and Standards. 5.19.  Alert Aircraft Procedures.  Maintain aircraft on alert status as follows: 5.19.1.  Park the aircraft in a designated alert parking area to expedite taxi and takeoff. AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   67  5.19.2.  Aircraft  preflight  times  should  align  the  alert  period  and  aircraft  preflight  validity period, eliminating the need to update the preflight during the alert period. 5.19.3.  The alert aircraft may be flown for purposes other than actual alert missions provided the following conditions are met: 5.19.3.1.  Ensure sufficient fuel remains on board to meet alert commitments. 5.19.3.2.  Maintain communications with the primary controlling agency. 5.19.3.3.  If  maintenance  actions  are  not  required,  the  aircraft  can  be  resealed  for  alert once the thru-flight inspection is completed.  In all cases, a new preflight is not required until the end of the initial preflight period. 5.19.4.  If  the  alert  aircraft  is  changed  to  a  different  preflighted/sealed  aircraft,  or  an  alert crew change occurs and the same aircraft remains on alert, the preflight or alert crew will, as a minimum, apply power to the aircraft and check the following systems (as applicable): 5.19.4.1.  AFTO Form 781. 5.19.4.2.  Interior and exterior for proper configuration and special equipment. 5.19.4.3.  Fuel quantity. 5.19.4.4.  Survival and emergency equipment. 5.19.4.5.

A crew member or ground controller may act as fireguard. 5.20.6.  Propulsion System Checks (Engine Runs).  When conducting maintenance-requested propulsion system checks, comply with the following: 5.20.6.1.  Prior  to  conducting  the  checks,  complete  an  operational  risk  management (ORM) assessment and review risk mitigation actions.  The minimum crew complement for  the  checks  will  be  the  crew  complement  required  for  aircraft  taxi.    Start  with  the preflight  checklist  and  accomplish  all  checklists  through  before  leaving  the  aircraft checklist.  (T-2) 5.20.6.2.  During the propulsion system checks, follow normal flight manual procedures and limitations (do not combine maintenance procedures/limitations into the checks).  Set power as requested and relay instrument readings, but limit troubleshooting to the scope of the aircraft flight manual.  Checks requiring functional check flight (FCF) procedures will be performed by FCF-qualified crews.  (T-2) 5.20.6.3.  When conducting propulsion system checks in areas of reduced traction, ensure all personnel on board are seated with lap belts fastened. 5.20.7.  Towing.  Aircrew members will not normally participate in towing operations.   The PIC  will  coordinate  with  the  senior  maintenance  officer  or  superintendent  to  ensure  the towing  supervisor  and  crew  are  qualified.    At  non-USAF  installations,  the  PIC  must  have approval from the airfield operations officer or manager prior to towing.  The PIC will ensure the  tow  team  supervisor  briefs  all  personnel  on  their  duties  and  the  associated  hazards.  Proper  checklists  will  be  used.    If  any  doubt  exists  as  to  the  qualification  of  tow  team personnel  or the safety of the operation, make no attempt to  tow the aircraft until  qualified Air Force personnel can be located. Under no circumstances will any crew member act as the towing supervisor.  (T-2) 5.20.8.  When  thunderstorms  are  reported  within  10  nm  of  the  airfield,  only  operations leading to an immediate engine start and departure may continue.  However, personnel must be  prepared  to  cease  all  activities  in  the  event  lightning  within  5  nm  is  declared.    When advised  of  lightning  within  5  nm  of  the  airfield,  all  flightline  activities  will  cease  and personnel will seek shelter.  (T2) 5.20.9.  Aircraft  taxiing  to  parking  or  hot  cargo  when  lightning  is  declared  within  5  nm should  not  expect  a  marshaller.    The  aircrew  will  hold  in  place  or  proceed  to  parking  if clearance  is  assured.    Remain  in  the  aircraft  if  ground  transportation  cannot  be  arranged.  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   69  Time permitting, coordinate with Base Operations if the aircraft will be parked in a location other than the one assigned.

(T-2) 5.23.3.  If Mode 4 fails in-flight, crews may continue to their intended destination if use is no longer required.  If use is required, the aircraft will land and repairs will be accomplished at the first repair facility.  (T-2) 5.24.  Traffic  Collision  Avoidance  System/Enhanced  Traffic  Collision  Avoidance  System (ETCAS) Operations. 5.24.1.  Traffic  Alerting  and  Collision  Avoidance  System.    It  is  imperative  to  follow Resolution  Advisories  (RAs)  to  obtain  aircraft  separation  computed  by  TCAS.    Failure  to follow  the  computed  RA  may  increase  the  probability  of  a  midair  collision.    Pilots  who deviate  from  an  ATC  clearance  in  response  to  an  RA  shall  notify  ATC  of  the  deviation  as soon  as  practical  and  promptly  return  to  the  ATC  clearance  when  the  traffic  conflict  is resolved or obtain a new clearance.  (T-2) 5.24.2.  Mission  requirements  may  allow  selection  of  Traffic  Advisory  (TA)  only  when operating  from  parallel  runways,  in  the  visual  traffic  pattern,  air  refueling,  or  in  formation   72  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 since the proximity to aircraft may result in unwarranted RAs.  Excessive climb and descent rates could lead to inadvertent TA/RA.  Reducing climb/descent rates near level off can limit inadvertent TCAS advisories. 5.25.  Navigational Aid Capability. 5.25.1.  Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum Airspace.  Airspace where RVSM is applied is considered special qualification airspace.  Both the operator and the specific aircraft type must be approved for operations in these areas.  Crews will refer to FLIP AP/2.  (T-2) 5.25.2.

Aircraft spraying is accomplished, if required (see Paragraph 5.53). 5.48.1.9.  En  route  to  the  US,  the  loadmaster  has  distributed  personal  customs declarations  to  all  passengers  and  crew  members;  has  briefed  passengers  and  crew members  on  customs  regulations;  and  has  prepared  and  compiled  necessary  border clearance forms for the PIC’s signature. 5.48.1.10.  En route to the US, the base of intended landing is notified of any change in ETA, to ensure border clearance is accomplished as soon as possible after landing. 5.48.1.11.  A Permit to Proceed is obtained when the mission requires an aircraft, which has  landed  in  the  US  for  customs  clearance,  to  proceed  to  another  US  base  to  obtain border clearance.  The permit delays customs inspection of cargo, passengers, and crew until arrival at the offload station, saving intermediate offloading and reloading normally required  for  customs  inspection.    The  Permit  to  Proceed  is  valid  only  to  the  airport  of next  landing, where the  border clearance must be completed, or  a new permit  obtained.  Do not make intermediate stops unless required by an emergency situation, or directed by AFSOC.  (T-2) 5.48.1.12.  When  an  aircraft  lands  for  a  US  border  clearance,  a  US  Customs representative  normally  meets  the  aircraft  to  obtain  the  required  documents.    Do  not deplane passengers or crew members, except a scanner, unless necessary for safety.  Do not  unload  until  approved  by  customs  and  agriculture  personnel  or  their  designated representatives.  This procedure applies to the initial landing in the US and all subsequent landings until crew, passengers, and cargo complete final border clearance. 5.48.2.  Exercise and Contingency Operations. 5.48.2.1.  General.   Certain  missions, which do not  transit normal  ports of entry or exit, require  special  procedures  to  expedite  compliance  with  customs,  public  health, immigration,  and  agricultural  requirements.    A  joint  memorandum  of  understanding establishes procedures and waivers. AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   85  5.48.2.2.  Implementation.  Traffic and border clearing agencies implement all or part of the  agreement  as  necessary  for  each  operation.    Inspection  and  clearance  may  be accomplished at the CONUS onload or offload base instead of the normal port of entry, or at the foreign onload or offload base. 5.49.  Customs Procedures. 5.49.1.  Outbound. General Declaration (Outward/Inward), is waived.   No  requirements.   Filing  of  a  Customs  Form  (CBP)  7507, 5.49.2.  Inbound.  Prepare one copy of the following documents before arrival. 5.49.2.1.  CBP 7507 (passenger list not required). 5.49.2.2.  Cargo manifest. 5.49.2.3.  For troops out of country less than 140 days. 5.49.2.3.1.  Troop commander’s certificate from examination of troop baggage. 5.49.2.3.2.  One  copy  of  DD  Form  1854,  US  Customs  Baggage  Declaration,  or Customs  Form  (CF)  6059B,  Customs  Declaration,  for  each  passenger  not  under command of the troop commander, to include observers, support personnel, civilians, news reporters, and crew members. 5.49.2.3.3.  Upon  arrival  at  a  CONUS  offload  base,  a  Customs  representative  meets the  aircraft  and  accepts  the  troop  commander's  certificate  with  respect  to  troop baggage.    Individual  baggage  declarations  are  not  required.    The  troop  commander should  have  inspected  troop  baggage.    Troops  debark  under  the  observation  of  the Customs representative with only a spot check of articles and baggage.  The Customs officer may elect to make a more extensive inspection. 5.49.2.4.  For troops out of the country 140 days or more. 5.49.2.4.1.  One  copy  of  DD  Form  1854,  US  Customs  Baggage  Declaration,  or  CF 6059B,  Customs  Declaration,  for  each  passenger.    This  includes  observers,  support personnel, civilians, news media personnel, and crew members. 5.49.2.4.2.  Upon  arrival  at  a  CONUS  offload  base,  a  Customs  representative  meets the aircraft and collects all declarations.  Troops debark under the observation of the Customs representative, who may make discretionary examination of the baggage. 5.50.  Immigration Procedures. 5.50.1.  Outbound.  No requirements. 5.50.2.  Inbound.  Submit the following to the Immigration inspector. 5.50.2.1.  One copy of CBP 7507. 5.51.  Customs, Immigration and Agricultural Inspections. 5.51.1.  Obtain  Customs,  Agriculture,  and  Public  Health  clearance,  as  required,  prior  to opening any doors, hatches, or windows, other than the crew entrance door, or enplaning and deplaning personnel.   86  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 5.51.2.  Proceed  directly  from  the  aircraft  to  Customs,  Immigration,  or  Agricultural inspection for processing when required by the inspector. 5.51.3.  US  military  aircraft  are  sovereign  territory.    When  cleared  to  overfly  or  land  in foreign  territory,  it  is  US  policy  to  assert  that  military  aircraft  are  entitled  to  the  privileges and  immunities  which  customarily  are  accorded  to  warships.    These  privileges  and immunities include, in the absence of stipulations to the contrary, exemption from duties and taxation,  immunity  from  search,  seizure,  and  inspections  (including  customs  and  safety inspections); or other exercise of jurisdiction by the host nation over the aircraft, personnel, equipment,  or  cargo  on  board.    The  PIC  will  not  authorize  search,  seizure,  inspection  or similar exercises of jurisdiction enumerated above by foreign authorities except by direction of HQ USAF or the American Embassy in the country concerned. 5.51.3.1.  The  PIC  will  not  permit  the  inspection  of  their  aircraft  by  officials  of  any foreign government.  If requested to submit to these actions, the PIC and crew will deny access to the aircraft and seek aid from the senior AFSOC (or other USAF) representative in the US Embassy or Consulate within the host nation.  Customs or other officials will be informed of the above policy and requested to confirm their request through their own government and with US Department of State representatives.  If necessary, the crew will seal the aircraft, the crew entered into crew rest, and departure intentions will be canceled until resolution of the matter by the appropriate authority.  Inform C2 authorities by the fastest available means should this situation occur.  (T-2) 5.51.3.2.  When confronted with a search request by foreign authorities, aircrews should consider the following procedures: 5.51.3.2.1.  In  most  cases,  search  attempts  may  be  stopped  by  a  statement  to  the foreign  officials  that  the  aircraft  is  sovereign  and  not  subject  to  search  without consent of HQ USAF or the chief of mission in the country concerned.  This should be clearly conveyed in a polite manner so as not to offend foreign authorities that may honestly, but mistakenly, believe they have authority to search USAF aircraft. 5.51.3.2.2.  If foreign authorities insist on conducting a search, the PIC must negotiate to delay the search until contact is made with HQ USAF or the appropriate embassy.  The  PIC  should  unequivocally  state  that  they  have  no  authority  to  consent  to  the search and that they must relay the host nation request to these agencies for decision.  The  PIC  should  then  notify  these  agencies  of  the  request  by  the  most  expeditious means  available.    Thereafter,  the  PIC  should  follow  instructions  provided  by  the appropriate embassy and HQ USAF.  (T-2) 5.51.3.2.3.  If foreign officials refuse to desist in their search request, the PIC should indicate  that  they  would  prefer  to  fly  the  aircraft  elsewhere  (provided  fuel  and mechanical considerations permit a safe departure) and request permission to do so. 5.51.3.2.4.  If permission is refused and the foreign authorities insist on forcing their way on board  an aircraft, the PIC should state that  they protest the course of  action being pursued and that they intend to notify both the appropriate American Embassy and HQ USAF of the foreign action.  The PIC should then allow the foreign agents onboard the aircraft, without physical resistance, and thereafter report the incident to HQ USAF and appropriate embassy, as soon as possible. AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   87  5.51.3.3.  In all instances, specific instructions may be briefed because of sensitive cargo or equipment.  These instructions and applicable provisions of classified supplements to the FCG should be followed, where applicable. 5.52.  Military Customs Preclearance Inspection Program: 5.52.1.  The  military  customs  program  outlined  in  DTR  4500-9-R  Part  5,  Chapter  506,  was developed to assist the DoD and other US Government agencies in the control of narcotics, contraband, and prohibited agricultural products, and to expedite entry of DoD personnel and material into the customs territory of the United States. 5.52.2.  Military  Customs  Inspectors  will  accomplish  this  inspection  immediately  prior  to departure  and  may  conduct  more  than  one  preclearance  inspection  on  CONUS-bound aircraft.    When  security  considerations  necessitate  deviation  from  this  policy,  mission planners  must  coordinate  with  the  appropriate  agency  to  ensure  the  mission  is  not jeopardized(T-2) 5.53.  Insect and Pest Control (Aircraft Spraying). 5.53.1.  The PIC will ensure required spraying is accomplished (if applicable), and certify the spraying on required forms.  (T-2) 5.53.2.  Aerosol  normally  is  dispersed  at  a  flow  rate  of  10  seconds  per  1,000  cubic  feet.  Direct  the  nozzle  toward  the  ceiling  of  the  compartment  or  space  being  sprayed.    Do  not spray any plastic surface or allow the spray to wet it. 5.53.3.  Spray  spaces  inaccessible  from  within  the  aircraft  after  completely  loading  fuel, baggage,  cargo,  and  passengers,  including  baggage  compartments,  wheel  wells,  and  other similar spaces. 5.53.4.  Spray the cabin, cockpit, and other spaces accessible from within the aircraft after the crew  is  on  board  and  after  closing  all  doors,  windows,  hatches,  and  ventilation  openings.    CAUTION:  If the insecticide label directs disembarkation after use, spray prior to boarding crew or passengers.  Close all doors and hatches for 10 minutes after dispensing and ventilate for 15 minutes before allowing anyone on board. 5.53.5.  Spray  for  50  seconds  unless  longer  periods  are  specified  for  the  country  being transited. 5.53.5.1.  When  spraying  is  required,  use  insecticide,  aerosol  d-phenothrin-2  percent, National  Stock  Number  (NSN)  6840-01-067-6674  (or  equivalent),  to  spray  the  aircraft.  Wear leather or Nomex gloves while spraying. 5.53.6.  When  seeing  any  insect  or  rodent  infestation  of  the  aircraft  in-flight,  notify  the destination  CCC,  base  operations,  or  airport  manager  of  the  situation  before  landing  so  the proper authorities can meet the aircraft. 5.53.7.  Upon  arrival,  do  not  open  cargo  doors  or  hatches  except  to  enplane  officials inspecting  the  aircraft  for  insect  or  rodent  infestation.    Do  not  onload  or  offload  until  the inspection  is  satisfactorily  completed.    This  procedure  may  be  altered  to  satisfy  mission  or local requirements, as arranged by the base air terminal manager.   88  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 Chapter 6 AIRLAND OPERATIONS 6.1.  Aircraft  Maximum  Gross  Weight.  Aircraft  maximum  gross  weight  is  164,000  pounds.  Waiver authority for operations above 164,000 pounds is  MAJCOM/A3 or COMAFSOF.  The maximum  waiverable  gross  weight  is  175,000  pounds.    Operations  above  164,000  pounds require  an  AFTO  Form  781A  entry  with  the  actual  gross  weight  at  which  the  aircraft  was operated. 6.2.  Checklists.  Aircrews  must  be  familiar  with  notes,  warnings,  and  cautions  without  direct reference to TO.  (T-2) 6.2.1.  The  only  pages  (or  inserts)  authorized  in  checklist  binders  are  C-130  series  TO aircrew  checklists,  AFSOC  approved  checklists,  briefing  guides,  and  unit  approved information  guides.

The PIC may authorize passengers (except patients) to visit the flight deck during non- critical phases of flight. 6.5.  Takeoff and Landing Policy. 6.5.1.  The PIC will occupy the left seat for all takeoffs and landings.  A certified Instructor Pilot may act as PIC from either seat.  (T-2) 6.5.2.  The  left  seat  pilot  will  land  during  aircraft  emergencies.    A  certified  Instructor  Pilot may takeoff or land from either seat under any condition.  (T-2) 6.5.3.  A MP or FP may takeoff and land from either seat. 6.5.4.  A MP, or FP during AC upgrade with  IP/EP  in the right  seat,  will takeoff/land from the left seat under the following conditions: (T-2) AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   89  6.5.4.1.  During formation departures and recoveries. 6.5.4.2.  During maximum effort or substandard airfield operations. 6.5.4.3.  Pilots in “Instructor Pilot” upgrade training may takeoff and land from the right seat under the supervision of an  Instructor Pilot  during  formation  departures and recoveries and during maximum effort or substandard airfield operations. 6.5.4.4.  During  missions  operating  in  areas  of  hostile  activity.    For  units  operating  in defined combat zones, COMAFSOF or equivalent may authorize landings from the right seat at specific airfields. 6.5.4.5.  At airfields that require any waiver  approval.    Exception:  Non-Department  of Defense (DoD) approach waivers. 6.5.4.6.  At  certification  airfields  specified  in  the  HQ  Air  Mobility  Command  Airfield Suitability and Restrictions Report (ASRR) via GDSS. 6.5.4.7.  PICs  who  possess  less  than  100  hours  in  command  in  C-130J  variant  aircraft since initial aircraft commander certification will make all takeoffs and landings when the right seat is occupied by a Copilot (CP) or FP. 6.6.  Copilot/First  Pilot  Landing  Policy.  Except as specified in  Paragraph 6.5, and provided no patients or DV4 or higher are on board, copilots may takeoff or land: 6.6.1.  From either seat if an Instructor Pilot or EP occupies the other seat. 6.6.2.  From the right seat if the PIC has accumulated at least 100 hours in command in a C-130J variant aircraft since initial aircraft commander certification. 6.6.3.  Current and qualified MCs may accomplish Night Vision Goggle (NVG) takeoffs and landings (non-maximum effort) from the right seat provided the pilot occupying the left seat is NVG airland current and qualified. 6.7.  Landing Gear and Flap Operation. 6.7.1.  The  PM  will  operate  the  landing  gear,  landing,  and  taxi  lights.    Actuate  the  landing gear only after the command of the PF the aircraft.  Prior to actuation of the landing gear, the PM will acknowledge the command by repeating it.  (T-2) 6.7.2.  PM operate the flaps only after the command of the PF.  Prior to operating the flaps, acknowledge the PF’s command by repeating it. 6.8.  Use  of  Outside  Observers.  Use  crew  members  to  assist  in  clearing  during  all  taxi operations and in-flight during arrivals and departures. 6.9.  Seat  Belts.

Exception:    Evaluators,  Instructors,  Mission  Commanders,  crew  members performing  scanner  duties,  outside  observers  during  taxi,  LMs  and  medical  personnel performing required duties; however, those individuals will have a designated seat (spot for combat loading procedures) and required restraint available.   90  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 6.9.2.  Provide a safety belt for all occupants over 2 years of age.  Occupants will fasten seat belts securely when turbulence is encountered or anticipated, or in areas of forecast clear air turbulence. 6.9.3.  Floor  loading  is  authorized  to  support  dedicated  unconventional  forces  and  foreign counterparts  during  operations,  exercises,  and  training.    This  procedure  will  not  be  used  in lieu  of  providing  normal  seating  when  available.    Exception:    Group  commander (COMAFSOF  for  contingency  operations)  may  authorize  Rapid  Infil/Exfil  procedures  and floor loading with non-SOF personnel. 6.10.  Aircraft  Lighting.  For  single  ship,  non-tactical  operations  refer  to  AFI  11-202V3.    Use landing lights  at  night  in  unlighted areas.  Use taxi lights  in-flight  any time the landing  gear is extended unless reflections cause pilot distractions. 6.10.1.  NVG operations may dictate that external lights are turned off or Infrared (IR) lenses used.  Conduct training operations with reduced or no external lighting within the confines of designated Restricted  or  Warning areas or host nation approved  areas  IAW AFI 11-202V3.  Single ship aircraft will display normal aircraft lighting outside Special Use Airspace (SUA). In  standard  formation,  all  aircraft  except  the  last  in  the  formation  will  display  formation lights  with  brightness  set  and  IR  anticollision  lights  as  required.    The  last  aircraft  in  the formation will display lights in accordance with AFI 11-202, Vol 3.       Note:  Formations may  vary  lighting  as  necessary  provided  adequate  visual  identification  of  the  formation  is maintained. 6.11.  Advisory/Required  Calls.  The  PF  will  announce  changes  to  the  level  of  automation, flight  director  and  autopilot  mode  section,  and  mode  transition,  (e.g.,  “Autopilot  engaged”, “Altitude  hold”,  “Auto-throttles”,  “Nav-Capture”,  etc.),  and/or  when  circumstances  require deviating  from  normal  procedures.    Tables  6.1    through  Table  6.4    depict  mandatory  calls  for takeoff, climb out and descent, non-precision  and precision approaches.  (T-2) Table 6.1.  Takeoff  (T-2). PHASE OF FLIGHT Takeoff – prior to Refusal Speed PF CALL  PM RESPONSE “Reject” 1 At Refusal Speed At Rotation Speed Notes:   “Go” 2 “Rotate” 2 1.  Prior to Refusal Speed, any crew member noting a safety of flight condition/malfunction will state “Reject” and give a brief description of the malfunction. 2.  If Rotation Speed and Refusal Speed are equal then state “Rotate”. Table 6.2.  Climb Out and Descent  (T-2).

The PF will announce intentions to land or go-around no later than the MAP. Table 6.4.  Precision Approach  (T-2). PHASE OF FLIGHT 100 feet above FAF/GSI altitude and Decision Height (DH) At DH with: Runway environment in sight Approach lights in sight (CAT 1 ILS) PM Call “100 Above”  “Land” “Continue” 1 PF RESPONSE “100 Above"  “Landing” “Continuing” “Going Around” Neither in sight Any condition requiring a go-around “Going Around” Note 1.  With weather at CAT 1 minimums on a CAT 1 ILS, the pilot may only see the initial portion of the Approach Lighting System (ALS).  The pilot may continue to 100 Height Above Touchdown (HAT) but may not descend below 100 feet above touchdown zone elevation using the ALS as a reference unless the red termination bars or the red side row bars are also visible and identifiable. “Go-around” “Go-around” 6.11.1.  Deviations:   92  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 6.11.1.1.  The PM will inform the PF when heading or airspeed deviations are observed, or when altitude is more than 100 feet from the desired and no attempt is being made to correct the deviation.  (T-2) 6.11.1.2.  Any  crew  member  seeing  a  deviation  of  200  feet  altitude  or  10  knots  in airspeed,  or  a  potential  terrain  or  obstruction  problem,  will  immediately  notify  the  PF.  Deviations from prescribed procedures will also be announced. 6.12.  Wind  Limitations.  Maximum  crosswind  limits  are  in  accordance  with  aircraft  TO limitations.  Remain within the “Recommended” or “Caution” areas of the crosswind charts for normal takeoffs and landings.  All maximum effort operations and simulated engine out landings must  fall  within  the  “Recommended”  area  unless  otherwise  approved  by  the  Group Commander/COMAFSOF (for contingency operations).  (T-2) 6.13.  Runway  Condition  Reading  (RCR)  and  Runway  Surface  Condition  (RSC).  The performance  charts  used  to  determine  braking  action  are  based  on  concrete  runways.    The runway  surface  should  be  considered  wet  when  water  on  the  runway  causes  a  reflective  glare. The  RCR  values  for  the  following  runway  surfaces  in  Table  6.5    are  estimates  based  on operational experience and should be used only as a guide. Table 6.5.  RCR Values. TYPE SURFACE Asphalt Aluminum Matting M8A1/With Antiskid Pierced Steel Plank (PSP) M8A1/Without Antiskid (PSP) Clay/Crushed Rock/Coral RCR (DRY) 23 20 20 13 16 RCR (WET) 12 10 8 3 5 6.13.1.  Limit  MC-130J  operations  into  and  out  of  slush  or  water  covered  runways  to  a covering of one inch.  This  number is  based on performance  charts where an RSC of 10 is equal to one inch of slush or water.  Performance data where more than one inch of slush or water is present may not be accurate. 6.14.  Wake  Turbulence  Avoidance.  Adhere  to  aircraft  wake  turbulence  avoidance  and separation criteria contained in DoD FLIP planning (General Planning Chapter 5). 6.15.  Landing  Zone  (LZ)  Markings.  LZ  markings  may  vary  depending  upon  the  supporting agency  (refer  to  AFI  13-217,  Drop  Zone  and  Landing  Zone  Operations).    The  markings  to  be used  must  be  firmly  established  during  mission  planning  and  included  in  the  aircrew  briefing.  (T2) 6.16.  Aircraft  Rescue  Fire-Fighting  Requirements  (ARFF).  ARFF  requirements  at  non- USAF active flying bases are as follows: 6.16.1.  Up  to  four  takeoffs  and  landings  within  seven  consecutive  days  may  be accomplished  at  a  LZ  or  airfield  without  ARFF.    This  is  an  airfield  restriction.    Each  unit should  track  totals  at  airfields  under  their  control.    If  totals  are  not  tracked  at  airfields owned/controlled by other agencies, Wing/Group current operations will track to ensure the restriction is not exceeded for assigned aircraft.  (T-2) AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   93  6.16.2.  For  more  frequent  operations  at  an  LZ  or  airfield,  refer  to  AFPAM  32-2004, Aircraft Fire  Protection  for  Exercises  and  Contingency  Response  Operations,  to  calculate ARFF  requirements.          Note:    Non-USAF  ARFF  vehicles  may  be  used  if  the  agent  and pumping capabilities are equivalent. 6.16.3.  Waivers  to  the  ARFF  requirements  will  be  considered  on  a  case-by-case  basis.  Required information for waiver request can be found in AFPAM 32-2004.  (T-2) 6.17.  Communications  Policy.  The  Air  Force  does  not  give  a  promise  of  confidentiality  to aircrews regarding their recorded aircraft crew communications.  Crew members are expected to maintain a high degree of cockpit professionalism and crew coordination at all times.   Primary  crew  members  will  monitor  Voice  Operated 6.17.1.  Aircraft  Interphone. Transmitter  and  interphone  during  all  phases  of  flight.    Crew  members  will  advise  the  PF before checking off interphone.  Crew members will ensure personnel  on headset or within listening distance are cleared prior to discussing classified information over interphone.  (T-2) 6.17.2.  Radios: 6.17.2.1.  The PM normally makes all ATC radio calls. 6.17.2.2.  In  terminal  areas,  all  crew  members  (if  able)  will  monitor  the  primary  ATC radio  unless  directed  otherwise.    A  crew  member  will  be  designated  to  monitor  C2 frequencies on the inbound and outbound legs.  (T-2) 6.17.2.3.  The pilot operating the radios will notify the crew which radio is primary, and update the crew when the primary radio changes.  (T-2) 6.17.2.4.  One of the pilots or CSO will record and read back all ATC clearances.  This may  be  disregarded  when  ATC  instructions  require  immediate  execution  or  when  such action interferes with timely completion of more important duties.  (T-2) 6.17.2.5.  Both  pilots  will  monitor  UHF  and  VHF  guard  emergency  frequencies  to  the maximum extent possible.  (T-2) 6.17.2.6.  The  Federal  Communications  Commission  prohibits  the  use  of  unauthorized frequencies for interplane, HAVE QUICK, or SECURE VOICE training. 6.18.  Crew  Resource  Management  (CRM).  CRM  is  a  critical  part  of  the  successful employment  of  the  MC-130J.    Due  to  the  MC-130J  architecture,  aircrew  should  insure  they coordinate  any  manipulation  of  the  CNI-MU,  Radar,  TAWS,  fuel  panel,  etc.    The  Pilot-in-Command will insure CRM is covered during the aircrew briefing.  (T-2) 6.18.1.  “Time Out" is the common assertive statement for use by all crew members.  The use of "Time Out" will: (T-2) 6.18.1.1.  Provide a clear warning sign of a deviation or loss of situational awareness. 6.18.1.2.  Provide an opportunity to break the error chain before a mishap occurs. 6.18.1.3.  Notify  all  crew  members  when  someone  sees  the  aircraft  or  crew  departing from  established  guidelines, is  simply uncomfortable with the developing conditions. the  briefed  scenario,  or that  someone   94  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 6.18.2.  As  soon  as  possible  after  a  "Time  Out"  has  been  called,  the  aircrew  will  take  the following actions: (T-2) 6.18.2.1.  Safety permitting, stabilize the aircraft and ensure terrain clearance. 6.18.2.2.  The initiating crew member will voice their concerns to the crew. 6.18.2.3.  The  PIC  will  provide  all  other  crew  members  with  the  opportunity  to  voice inputs relative to the stated concerns. 6.18.2.4.  After  considering  all  inputs,  the  PIC  will  direct  the  aircrew  to  continue  the current course of action or direct a new course of action. 6.18.3.  ACAWS  crew  coordination.   Preface  all  ACAWS  messages  by  stating “ADVISORY”, “CAUTION”, or “WARNING” followed by reading the displayed message verbatim prior to silencing the audio alert. 6.18.4.  Fuel Panel.  The fuel panel is considered a “verification panel.”  The PM/Loadmaster (LM)/CSO  should  advise  the  PF  before  operating  the  panel  (i.e.,  priming,  cross-feeding, tank-to-  engine,  transferring,  nonstandard  configurations,  and  dumping).    After  completing the task, the PM should verify the panel is set correctly.  To facilitate this coordination, pilots should plan to make changes to the fuel panel during periods of low workload such as before taxi and during cruise segments. 6.18.5.  Critical Action Coordination. 6.18.5.1.  Flight  critical/irreversible  actions  should  always  be  confirmed  by  two  crew members.    These  actions  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  pulling  the  engine  fire  handle, placing  the  engine  start  switch  to  stop,  moving  a  propeller  control  switch  to  feather, discharging  agent,  dumping  fuel,  and  pulling  ECBs.    The  crew  member  performing  the action points to the affected switch/handle and verbally seeks confirmation from a second crew  member  (i.e.,  “CONFIRM  NUMBER  ONE”).    The  crew  member  confirming  the action  looks  at  the  affected  switch/handle  and  acknowledges  (i.e.,  “NUMBER  ONE CONFIRMED”). 6.18.5.2.  Once the fire handle is pulled, the ACAWS messages indicating the shutdown condition/situation  may  disappear.    Verifying  and  verbally  confirming  associated ACAWS  messages  prior  to  engine  shutdown  will  assist  the  aircrew  to  determine  if  the engine can be restarted or if a greater emergency arises. 6.19.  Automation.  Aircraft  automation  will  not  command  crew  actions.    The  automated systems will recommend/perform actions and the crew will determine/verify the proper course of action.  (T-2) 6.19.1.  The PF will determine the most desirable level of automation for a given situation. 6.19.2.  If  the  AFCS/Flight  Director  provides  unexpected  commands  to  the  flight  controls, the  PF  will  revert  to  lower  levels  of  automation  or  manual  flight  as  necessary  before attempting to resolve system problems.  (T-2) 6.19.3.  Crews will follow the guidance below, except  for cruise flight  (above 3,000 AGL): (T-2) AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   95  6.19.3.1.  The PF will fly the aircraft and maintain a dedicated head-up lookout.  If the PF intends to be head-down, aircraft control shall be transferred to the PM, who will remain head-  up.    Head  down  time  does  not  include  momentary  scanning/manipulation  of  the CNI-MU, HDDs and panels. 6.19.3.2.  Any crew member that observes both  pilots head-down at the same time shall alert the PF. 6.19.3.3.  If  the  PM  must  divert  attention  away  from  normal  clearing  and  monitoring duties  for  an  extended  period  of  time,  the  PM  will  state  “Head-Down”.    The  PF  will verbally  acknowledge  this  call.    The  PM  will  verbalize  “Head-Up”  after  completion  of duties.  The PF will then update the PM on current status as required.  (T-2) 6.19.4.  A closed loop system of entering data and verifying the correct data is entered before allowing the aircraft automation to perform a function is critically important.  Regardless of who initiates the action, the other pilot must verify the data and both pilots will monitor the aircraft for the appropriate response.  (T-2) 6.19.4.1.  Table  6  6    and  Table  6.7    provide  standard  actions  for  both  pilots  during Automated and Manual flight. 6.19.4.2.  Automated Flight  is  defined as the  autopilot fully engaged and coupled to  the Flight  director.    Use  auto-throttles  as  desired.    CAUTION:    If  the  auto-throttles  are disengaged  for  sustained  descents  during  automatic  flight,  it  is  possible  that  Altitude Capture may occur with the power levers at or near Flight Idle and result in an approach to stall condition. 6.19.4.3.  Manual Flight is defined as the PF providing manual input to the flight controls or autopilot.  Use auto-throttles as desired. Table 6.6.  Automated Flight  (T-2).

When a GCAS  TERRAIN or TAWS TERRAIN/OBSTACLE AHEAD alert occurs and terrain/obstacle clearance cannot be assured visually, immediately change the flight path AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   97  (within 3 to 5 seconds) by initiating a takeoff power climb.  Continue the climb until a safe altitude  is  reached  or  until  exiting  the  alert  envelope.    With terrain  and  obstacles  clearly  in sight, the PF will call terrain/obstacle in sight, state intentions, and visually remain clear of terrain/obstacles. the  situation  degrades  and  a  GCAS  PULL  UP  or  TAWS TERRAIN/OBSTACLE  PULL  UP  alert  occurs, the  Wind Shear/GCAS/TAWS  alert  recovery  in  the  flight  manual.    (T-2)              WARNING:    Do  not delay pull-up for diagnosis of the low-altitude warning. immediately  execute   If 6.20.2.  In  TACTICAL  mode,  several  GCAS  alert  envelopes  are  modified  to  allow  for maneuvering in close proximity to terrain.  Normally, this mode is most suitable for modified contour flight and VFR low-altitude arrivals but, at the PIC discretion, may be used for any tactical operation. 6.21.  Radar Altimeter. 6.21.1.  Instrument Approaches. 6.21.1.1.  Precision Approaches. 6.21.1.1.1.  Set RADALT reference to HAT minus 50 feet. 6.21.1.1.2.  CAT II ILS.  Set published Radar Altimeter minimums. 6.21.1.2.  Non-Precision Approaches.  Setting the RADALT as prescribed below is meant to adequately alert the crew to an unsafe terrain clearance condition (Altitude-Altitude) in the  absence  of  a  Minimums-Minimums  alert.    Setting  the  RADALT  to  a  higher  setting than  prescribed  may  result  in  premature/unexpected  Altitude-Altitude  advisories  and prevent the GCAS Minimums alert. 6.21.1.2.1.  Straight-In  Approaches.    Normally  set  RADALT  reference  to  250  feet (minimum setting). 6.21.1.2.2.  Circling  Approaches.    Normally  set  RADALT  reference  to  300  feet (minimum setting). 6.21.1.3.  When  established  on  a  published  approach  in  IMC,  or  at  night  when  terrain clearance  cannot  be  assured,  and  an  Altitude-Altitude  special  alert  is  heard,  initiate  an immediate Goaround.  Once terrain clearance is confirmed, resume normal operations.  In day  VMC,  the  aircrew  will  evaluate  the  alert  and  determine  the  appropriate  course  of action (continue the approach or go-around).  (T-2) 6.22.  Runway  and  Taxiway  Requirements.  Use  normal  takeoff  and  landing  procedures whenever  practical.    For  mission  accomplishment,  if  approach  end  overruns  are  available  and stressed or authorized for normal operations, they may be used to increase the runway available for  takeoff.    All  speeds  and  distances  will  be  computed  “without  nose  wheel  steering.”    For mission  accomplishment  the  PIC  may  authorize  “with  nose  wheel  steering”  corrections  on  dry hard-surfaced  runways.    Minimum  runway  width  is  60  feet  or  19  meters.    Minimum  taxiway width is 30 feet or 9 meters. 6.22.1.  Use of wheel brakes.  Any time wheel brakes are used on landing rollout greater than that  defined  in  the  Dash  1  as  a  “partial  brake  landing”,  the  PIC  will  ensure  the  BRAKE COOLING  CHARTS  (Dash  1-1)  time  constraints  are  complied  with.    Brake  cooling  times may be disregarded if the runway available is equal to or greater than Critical Field Length   98  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 Adjusted  Minimum (CFL)/ Takeoff (AMFLMETO)/Minimum  Field  Length  Maximum  Effort  Takeoff  (MFLMETO)  using  an RCR of 2.  For operational missions, the squadron/mission commander may waive both the brake cooling times and CFL/AMFLMETO/MFLMETO.  (T-2) Length  Maximum Field Effort 6.22.2.  Normal Operations (Non-Training): 6.22.2.1.  Takeoff.  Minimum runway length is critical field length. 6.22.2.2.  Landing.    The  minimum  runway  required  for  normal  landings  is  the  charted landing  distance  over  50  foot  obstacle  with  outboard  engines  in  high  speed  ground  idle and inboard engines in  max reverse (2OB HGI;  2IB REV. in the Performance Manual), and maximum anti-skid braking. 6.22.2.2.1.  If  runway  length  available  for  landing  is  less  than  required  by  the previous criteria,  crews may use landing  ground roll plus  1,500 feet  when approved by the squadron commander. In this case, ensure the landing touchdown is in the first 500 feet of the runway. 6.22.3.  Short Field Operations. 6.22.3.1.  Only maximum effort landing qualified crews may use short field procedures.  Use  of  non-hard-surfaced requires  Group  Commander (COMAFSOF for contingency operations) approval.  Groups may list approved locations in Chapter 10. runways  or taxiways 6.22.3.2.  Runway  length.    Max  effort  qualified  Aircraft  Commanders  are  authorized  to use MFLMETO.  Aircrew should use AMFLMETO when runway is available. 6.22.3.3.  Takeoff  and  Obstacle  Clearance  Speeds:    When  obstacles  are  a  factor,  use maximum  effort  takeoff  speed  (Vmeto)  and  climb  out  at  maximum  effort  obstacle clearance speed.  Use Adjusted Max Effort Rotation Speed (AMAX) whenever possible.     WARNING:  Aircraft performance and obstacle clearance is based on obtaining and then maintaining obstacle clearance speed as quickly as possible.  Aircraft performance below obstacle clearance speed may not allow safe clearance of obstacles. 6.22.3.4.  Landing.  Minimum runway length is ground roll plus 500 feet.  If the zone is unmarked, minimum runway length is ground roll plus 1,000 feet.  Group Commanders (COMAFSOF for contingency operations) may approve unmarked 500 foot zones. 6.22.3.4.1.  Always  compute  landing  performance  with  2  engines  in  reverse,  2 engines in ground idle, and max antiskid braking.  Group Commanders (COMAFSOF for contingency operations) may approve the use of all 4 in reverse. Table 6.8.  Normal Operations and Maximum Effort Operations.

MAJCOM/A3/DO may waive runway length/width and taxiway width requirements. 2.  Use maximum effort takeoff procedures if available runway length is less than CFL. 3.    Minimum  runway  length  for  maximum  effort  operations  is  the  ADJUSTED  MFLMETO.  Squadron Commander may approve the use of MFLMETO not corrected for VMCA and VMU3 if mission necessity dictates. 4.    Minimum runway required for normal landings is the charted landing distance over 50 foot obstacle  with  outboard  engines  in  HSGI  and  inboard  engines  in  max  reverse.    Runway  Visual Range  (RVR)  less  than  40  (3/4  mile)  –  add  1,000  feet.    RVR  equal  to  or  greater  than  40  (3/4 mile) – add 500 feet.  If runway length available for landing is less than required by the previous criteria,  crews  may  use  landing  ground  roll  plus  1,500  feet  when  approved  by  the  squadron commander.  In this case, you must ensure the landing touchdown is in the first 500 feet of the runway. 5.    Use  maximum  effort  landing  procedures  whenever  the  runway  available  for  landing  is  less than  that  required  for  a  normal  landing  with  outboard  engines  in  HSGI  and  inboard  engines  in Max Reverse (2OB HGI; 2IB REV in the performance manual) and max anti-skid braking.  Plan the touchdown within the first 500 feet of usable runway. 6.  Minimum runway length using max effort procedures is ground roll plus 500 feet if a 500 foot touchdown  zone  is  clearly  marked  on  the  runway.    If  the  touchdown  zone  is  greater  than  500 feet, or unmarked, minimum runway length is ground roll plus 1,000 feet. 7.    LZ  markings  may  vary  depending  upon  the  supporting  agency  (refer  to  AFI  13-217,  Drop Zone  and  Landing  Zone Operations).    Markings  being  used  will  be  established  during  mission planning and included in the aircrew briefing. 8.  On non-marked (AMP-4) runways, a go-around point will be identified to all crew members prior to execution. 6.22.3.5.  Training. 6.22.3.5.1.  Minimum  runway  length  is  3,000  feet  or  IAW  Paragraph  6.22.2  and 6.22.3, whichever is greater.   100  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 6.22.3.5.2.  Takeoff speed will be AMAX.  Squadron commanders may  approve the use  of  actual  max  effort  speeds  (takeoff  and  obstacle  clearance)  on  a  case-by-case basis during training. 6.22.3.5.3.  Simulated obstacle clearance height will not exceed 50 feet.  (T-2) 6.22.3.6.  NVG  Operations:        WARNING:  On  blacked-out  runways,  a  go-around  point will be identified to all crew members prior to execution.  (T-2) 6.23.  Aircraft Taxi Obstruction Clearance Criteria. 6.23.1.  Without wing walkers, avoid taxi obstructions by at least 25 feet; with wing walkers, by at least 10 feet.  Exception:  Locally based aircraft may taxi within 25 feet of obstacles without a wing walker when fixed taxi routes are marked and the obstruction is permanent, but will still be no closer than 10 feet.  Taxi routes must be used by the same model aircraft for  which  they  were  designed  and  in  the  specifically  designed  parking  spots.    Support equipment shall be located in appropriately designated areas.  (T-2) 6.23.2.  Whenever  taxi  clearance  is  doubtful,  use  a  wing  walker.    If  wing  walkers  are unavailable, deplane a crew member to ensure obstruction clearance. 6.23.3.  Use  low-speed  ground  idle  when  practical.    If  Foreign  Object  Damage  (FOD)  is  a problem, the outboard engines may be shut down provided gross weight, taxiway conditions, and weather are favorable. 6.23.4.  After landing and clearing the runway, with the approval of the pilot, the loadmaster may open the aft cargo door and lower the ramp to 12” above horizontal to prepare for cargo offload or onload.  Ensure all equipment, cargo, and passengers remain secured in the cargo compartment. 6.23.5.  Pilots  will  be  advised  of  any  known  obstructions  that  penetrate  shaded  area  in Figure 6.1.  (T-2) AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   101  Figure 6.1.  Ground Operations Obstruction Clearance Criteria  (T-2).  6.24.  Reverse Taxi. 6.24.1.  The  pilot  will  coordinate  engine  status/utilization  with  CP  and  taxi  directions  and signals with the loadmaster and marshaller prior to commencing reverse taxi operations.  (T-2) 6.24.2.  Secure all cargo and ensure all passengers are seated with seat belts fastened prior to aircraft movement. 6.24.3.  Open the cargo door and lower the ramp to approximately horizontal. 6.24.4.  The loadmaster will be on the aircraft ramp in the best position to direct reverse taxi, report  any  hazards,  and  provide  the  pilot  with  timely  interphone  instructions  on  turns, distance remaining, conditions of the maneuvering area, and stopping point.  If four or five ground  loading  ramps  or  three  canary  slides  are  installed,  at  least  one  will  be  removed  to allow  unobstructed  vision  from  the  cargo  ramp  while  backing.    During  night  reverse  taxi operations, the pilot and loadmaster will ensure that visibility in the taxi area is sufficient to conduct safe taxi operations.  Do not taxi within 25 feet of an obstacle nor stop less than 25 feet from an obstruction, even if using wing walkers.  (T-2) 6.25.  Takeoff and Landing Obstruction Clearance Criteria. 6.25.1.  PICs  will  comply  with  the  ASRR  requirements  prior  to  operating  at  airfields classified as “special PIC airports” or “certification airfields” by the ASRR. 6.25.2.  An  airfield  is  considered  suitable  for  C-130  operations  when  no  obstructions penetrate into the shaded area of Figure 6.2.  This ensures obstruction clearance only if the aircraft  is  maintained  within  35  feet  of  runway  centerline  and  the  angle  of  bank  does  not exceed 5°.   102  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 6.25.3.  When an obstruction penetrates the shaded area of  Figure 6.2, specific approval by the  Group  Commander/COMAFSOF  (for  contingency  operations)  is  required  and  the  PIC must be advised of the height and location of the obstruction, as well as specific procedures to avoid the obstacle (i.e., landing beyond the obstacle).  (T-2) Figure 6.2.  Takeoff and Landing Obstruction Clearance Criteria.  6.26.  Operations Over Arresting Cables. 6.26.1.  Avoid  landing  on  (touching  down  on)  arresting  cables  (does  not  include  recessed cables). If the aircraft lands on or before the cable, the crew should contact the tower to have the cable inspected. 6.26.2.  Operations  on  runways  where  the  arresting  cable  has  less  than  eight  tie-downs  are authorized when required for mission accomplishment. 6.26.3.  For all operations over arresting cables, cross the cable on runway  centerline at the minimum  practical  speed  to  minimize  the  potential  for  damage  to  the  aircraft.    Maintain appropriate back pressure on the aircraft yoke during taxi operations to reduce nose landing gear downforce. 6.27.  Three-Engine Takeoffs.  Actual engine-out takeoffs require MAJCOM/A3 (COMAFSOF for contingency operations) waiver. 6.28.  Aircraft Recovery from Unprepared Surfaces.  Aircrews should not attempt to recover an aircraft after inadvertent entry onto surfaces that are not suitable for taxi.  Ground crews using appropriate  equipment  will  normally  recover  the  aircraft.    Aircrews  may  recover  the  aircraft  at austere locations if, after thorough inspection, the PIC is sure there is no aircraft damage and the surface will support the aircraft. 6.29.  Engines  Running  Onload  or  Offload  (ERO).  Do  not  use  ERO  procedures  when explosive  cargo  (hazard  class  1.1-1.4)  is  involved  unless  authorized  by  the    exercise  operation AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   103  order or contingency air tasking orders.  Exception:  Small arms ammunition hazard class 1.4S may  be  on/offloaded  using  ERO  procedures  providing  the  total  NEW  does  not  exceed  airfield restrictions at the assigned on/offload location. 6.29.1.  The  ERO  procedures  in  this  paragraph  may  be  used  for  any  mix  of  personnel  or cargo.  The aft cargo door and ramp is preferred when more than 10 passengers are involved.  The  PIC  will  assess  prevailing  weather,  lighting  and  parking  location  to  ensure  safe operations. 6.29.2.  General Procedures: 6.29.2.1.  The PIC will brief crew members on the intended ERO operation, emphasizing specific crew member duties. 6.29.2.2.  The parking brake will be set and one pilot will monitor brakes, interphone and radio.  (T-2) 6.29.2.3.  Operate  engines  in  ground  idle  (low-speed,  if  applicable).    If  conditions warrant, consider using Hotel mode to further reduce propeller blast. 6.29.2.4.  Turn wing leading edge lights on during night EROs.  Taxi lights may be used at the discretion of the pilot. 6.29.2.5.  Complete  passenger  and  cargo  manifests,  crew  lists  and  DD  Form  365-4, Weight and Balance Clearance Form F, for the subsequent sortie.  Note:  DD Form 365-4 is not required for the subsequent sortie if the aircraft will depart empty. 6.29.2.6.  Resume taxi after the LM states the aircraft is “clear to taxi”. 6.29.2.7.  Do  not  onload  or  offload  through  two  different  doors  simultaneously.  WARNING:  Due to the hazards involved (i.e., propeller blast, proximity to engines and propellers, lack of paratroop door steps, etc.), only hand transferable items of cargo may be on/offloaded through the paratroop doors during EROs. 6.29.3.  Personnel onload and offload through the crew entrance door. 6.29.3.1.  The pilot will give clearance to open the crew entrance door. 6.29.3.2.  During  on/offload,  station  a  crew  member  (normally  the  LM)  on  interphone (cord held taut) approximately 25 feet and at a 45° angle from the aircraft axis. 6.29.3.3.  Brief deplaning personnel to remain forward of the interphone cord. 6.29.4.  Personnel or cargo on/offload through the aft cargo door and ramp. 6.29.4.1.  After the  aircraft has slowed to  taxi  speed, the  LM may  remove all tie-downs except  one  forward  and  one  aft  restraint.    Remove  remaining  restraints  only  after  the aircraft  is  stopped  and  vehicle  drivers  are  in  place.    Drivers  will  not  release  vehicle parking brakes until all restraints are removed and cleared to proceed by the LM.  (T-2) 6.29.4.2.  Upon clearance from  the pilot,  open the aft cargo door and lower the ramp  to 12” above horizontal. 6.29.4.3.  The  LM  will  direct  all  on/offload  operations  using  prebriefed  signals.  Passengers will be directed by a crew member when enplaning or deplaning.  (T-2)   104  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 6.29.4.4.  Other  qualified  LMs  may  direct  the  operation,  if  available,  but  the  crew loadmaster retains overall responsibility for the operation. 6.29.5.  Engine  Running  Crew  Change  (ERCC).    Authorized  during  unit  training  missions.  The  enplaning  crew  will  not  approach  the  aircraft  until  the  deplaning  LM  is  in  position  on headset outside the aircraft.  Keep ERCC to the absolute minimum necessary to accomplish the mission.  (T-2) AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   105  Chapter 7 AIRCRAFT SECURITY 7.1.  General.  This  chapter provides  guidance  for aircraft security  on the ground  and in-flight. AFSOC  MC/C-130J  aircraft  are  Protection  Level  "C"  resources.    This  security  priority designation applies to operational aircraft, wherever they are located, worldwide.  Some aircraft contain  equipment  and  documents  that  require  protection  per  DoD  5200.1-R  and  AFI  31-401, Information Security Program Management. 7.2.  Procedures.  The  PIC  is  ultimately  responsible  for  the  security  of  their  aircraft  when located away from US military installations.  Air Force Joint Instruction (AFJI) 31-102, Physical Security,  covers  security  arrangements  when  US  Air  Force  aircraft  are  located  on  other  DoD installations.  Arrangements must be made to protect the aircraft during crew rest status at non- US  protected  locations.    If  US  military  security  forces  are  not  available,  the  US  embassy assigned  to  that  country  must  be  consulted  to  ensure  security  arrangements  are  made.    For missions  involving  a  planning  agency,  the  agency  must  coordinate  with  the  PIC  to  ensure  the planned  security  measures  conform  to  mission  requirements.    The  amount  of  security  required will vary, depending on location and ground time.  (T-2) 7.2.1.  For  non-permissive  or  uncertain  environments,  airfield  and  LZ  security  is  the responsibility  of  the  agency  requesting  the  airlift.    Crews  will  work  with  the  agency requesting the airlift to insure security meets the requirement for the mission. 7.2.2.  For  permissive  environments,  PIC  will  receive  a  threat  assessment  and  force protection  capability  evaluation  briefing  at  home  station  prior  to  departure  and  receive updates en route, if required.  When landing at a DoD component installation, the installation commander  is  responsible  to  provide  adequate  security  for  the  aircraft.    The  PIC  will determine  if  security  is  adequate.    Planning  agencies  and  PIC  will  use  Table  7.1  to  help assess  the  risk  to  parked  aircraft  for  planned  overnight  stops  located  at  non-US  military installation  overseas  and  civilian  airfields.    Note:    Aircrews  do  possess  the  training  to provide the appropriate security when present at the aircraft.  For unscheduled or emergency landings at non-USAF installations, PIC will assess the aircraft security situation and take the following actions, if force protection capability appears insufficient: 7.2.2.1.  Aircrew  surveillance.    If  the  aircraft  is  not  remaining  overnight,  aircrews  are capable  of  maintaining  appropriate  aircraft  security.    The  PIC  will  direct  armed  crew members  to  remain  with  the  aircraft  and  maintain  surveillance  of  aircraft  entrances  and activities in the aircraft vicinity. 7.2.2.2.  Area Patrol.  Request area patrol coverage from local security forces to include back-up  response  forces.    If  local  authorities  request  payment  for  this  service,  use  AF Form 15, USAF Invoice. 7.2.2.3.  Departure  without  Crew  Rest.    If  local  security  forces  are  unacceptable  or unavailable,  the  PIC  may  waive  Flight  Duty  Period  restrictions  and  depart  as  soon  as possible for destination with  adequate  force protection.   If unable to  depart the location due to system malfunction, the aircrew must secure the aircraft to the best of their ability.  In no case, will the entire crew leave the aircraft unattended.  Crew rest requirements will be  subordinate  to  aircraft  security  when  the  airframe  may  be  at  risk.    The  PIC  should   106  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 rotate  a  security  detail  among  the  crew  to  provide  for  both  aircraft  protection  and  crew rest until relief is available.  PIC will coordinate through home station channels to acquire additional security.  (T-2) 7.2.3.  Tailored Security Measures.  Standard physical security measures may be impractical at  times  due  to  mission,  terrain,  climate,  sociopolitical  sensitivities,  or  other  factors.    For example,  some  countries  don't  allow  armed  security  personnel.    On  other  deployments,  the mission  may  rely  on  maintaining  a  low  profile  and  attracting  as  little  attention  as  possible.  At such locations, tailor security measures to meet unique requirements when necessary.  As a minimum, lock aircraft entry points and hatches.  If it is not possible to lock aircraft, secure aircraft entry points and hatches in a manner to indicate unauthorized entry, i.e., taping hatch release handles or using seals.  The PIC is the final authority for determining tailored security measures.    Contact  with  US  Embassy  personnel  is  required  at  locations  where  security agreements are not in existence. 7.2.4.  Ground  security  teams.    Ground  security  teams  may  be  considered  to  guard  the aircraft for planned overnight stops.  Teams may travel in MEP status and are responsible to the PIC at all times.  The PIC will ensure security team members receive a mission briefing, aircraft egress, and passenger briefings, as appropriate.  The squadron commander is the final approval authority for the need of ground security teams for their aircraft and authority may be delegated no lower than the PIC.  (T-2) 7.2.4.1.  Ground  security  teams  will  comply  with  AFMAN  24-204(I)  at  all  times  when carrying weapons, ammo, and equipment onboard the aircraft.  (T-2) 7.2.4.2.  Due  to  the  sensitivity  of  weapons  in  foreign  countries,  ground  security  teams will keep their weapons  inside the aircraft  and out-of-sight of  foreign nationals,  even if the FCG allows them to be carried outside the aircraft.  If a destination requires weapons be carried outside the aircraft, the controlling MAJCOM must approve such action prior to deployment.  (T-2) 7.2.5.  Unauthorized  entry.    If,  in  the  PIC’s  judgment,  the  aircraft  needs  to  be  locked  and sealed as a measure to detect unauthorized entry: 7.2.5.1.  Use  the  aircraft  lock.          Note:    The  aircraft  should  be  locked  during  all  off-station missions remaining overnight. 7.2.5.2.  If the aircraft lock is unavailable, comply with Paragraph 7.2.2.  Close and seal the  main  crew  entrance  door  or  left  troop  door  using  a  metal  boxcar  seal  or  other controllable  device  to  identify  forced  entry.    Wipe  the  immediate  area  around  the  seal clean  to  help  investigate  forced  entry.    If  the  seals  are  damaged  or  have  been  tampered with,  notify  the  appropriate  local  authorities,  the  controlling  agency,  and  inspect  the aircraft thoroughly. 7.2.5.3.  Coordinate  with  the  local  base  operations  representative  on  procedures  for servicing the aircraft while the crew is away.  If a padlock is used, the key or combination will  be  left  with  base  operations  or  the  representative  for  servicing  and  maintenance personnel.  (T-2) 7.2.6.  Security  awareness  is  crucial  to  effective  mission  accomplishment.    Aircrews  must always remain vigilant to their surroundings, especially at high threat, low security locations.  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   107  During  preflight  activities,  aircrews  will  inspect  accessible  areas,  to  include  aircraft  wheel-wells,  air-  conditioning  compartments,  and  cargo  compartment  for  unauthorized  packages, personnel, or other unfamiliar devices.  Report any suspicious items to host security forces.  Aircrews  will  maintain  a  heightened  security  posture  throughout  all  pre-takeoff  activities.  (T-2) 7.3.  Aircraft  Security  Risk  Assessment  Matrix.  Planning agencies and the PIC will use this matrix to help assess the risk to parked aircraft in a permissive environment.  This matrix will be used for planned overnight stops at non-US military installations overseas and civilian airfields.  A cumulative score of less than 55 implies that normal unmanned aircraft security measures are adequate.    A  score  of  55  to  90  implies  moderate  security  risk.    Commanders  may  consider additional  security  measures.    If  the  cumulative  score  is  greater  than  90,  commanders  should consider  deploying  or  contracting  security  personnel.    The  squadron  commander  or  mission commander  is  the  final  approval  authority  for  aircraft  security  issues.    Authority  may  be delegated  no  lower  than  the  PIC.    Exception:    during  unscheduled  or  emergency  landings  the PIC is the final approval authority for aircraft security.  The PIC should contact the US Embassy or  United  States  Defense  Attaché  Office  for  security  assistance.    Note:    Normally,  additional security  for  the  aircraft  is  not  required  at  military  installation  within  a  NATO  country  or  US civilian airfields approved by the FAA/TAS.  (T-2) Table 7.1.  Aircraft Force Protection Risk Assessment Matrix  (T-2).

Derive the local threat from valid intelligence sources only.  2.  “Adequate lighting” is equal to the illumination provided by one standard USAF light cart. 3.  If a security response team and security patrol is not present, commanders should consider  employing or contracting security personnel. 7.4.  Protective  Standards  for  Aircraft  Carrying  Distinguished  Visitors.  This  paragraph applies specifically to aircraft transporting DV Code 4 or above.  PICs are responsible for aircraft security at en route stops. 7.4.1.  DoD Installations.  Notify the base security forces of estimated arrival and departure times.    Request  continuous  security  surveillance  during  the  entire  ground  time.    If  the installation is unable to comply, arrange for the best protection available. 7.4.2.  Non-DoD  Installations.    Contact  the  airport  manager  or  installation  commander  to arrange for force protection.  If available security is inadequate, purchase additional security using AF Form 15. 7.5.  Arming of Crew Members.  Crew Members will be armed IAW with AFI 31-117, Arming and Use of Force by Air Force Personnel.  When directed, at least one crew member each from the flight deck and cargo compartment will carry weapons.  (T-2) 7.5.1.  Issue.  Before departing home station, authorized crew members will obtain weapons, ammunition,  lock,  and  key.    Crew  members  must  present  a  current  AF  Form  523,  USAF Authorization to Bear Firearms, to be issued a weapon.  Crew members will be reissued the same weapon until the mission terminates at home station.  If an armed crew member must leave the crew en route, transfer the weapon to  another authorized crew member, using AF Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt.  (T-2) 7.5.2.  Loading  and  Transfer  of  Weapons.    Load  and  unload  weapons  at  approved  clearing barrels/facilities if available.  To transfer a loaded weapon to another crew member, place the weapon on a flat surface.  Do not use a hand-to-hand transfer. AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   109  7.5.3.  Wearing of Weapons.  Wear weapons in a holster, concealed at all times to protect the identity of armed crew members.  Do not wear weapons off the flightline, except to and from the  CCC,  armories,  and  other  facilities  associated  with  aircrew  activities  such  as  base operations, fleet service, cargo or passenger terminals, flightline cafeterias, snack bars, etc. 7.5.4.  Weapons Storage.  Crew members will be armed before beginning preflight or onload duties.  When no passengers are on board and after a satisfactory stowaway check, weapons may  be  stored  in  the  gun  box  in-flight.    If  no  gun  box  is  available,  retain  weapon  for  the duration  of  the  flight.    Crew  members  will  rearm  before  landing.    Weapons  need  not  be unloaded before being placed in the gun box.  (T-2) 7.5.5.  Crew  Rest.    During  crew  rest,  store  weapons  in  the  most  secure  facility  available, normally  the  base  armory.    If  a  weapons  storage  facility  is  unavailable  or  the  country prohibits or restricts the entry of weapons, secure firearms and ammunition in the gun box. 7.5.5.1.  Aircraft  Without  a  Gun  Box.    If  an  aircraft  without  a  gun  box  must  remain overnight at a location where a government-owned storage facility is unavailable, use the nearest  acceptable  facility.    Acceptable  storage  facilities  are  US  or  Allied  military services  armories,  US  National  Guard  and  Reserve  armories,  and  US  civil  law enforcement  armories.    If  none  of  these  are  available,  or  the  PIC  believes  weapons security may be compromised, crew members may secure their weapons in their quarters, one  crew  member  will  remain  with  the  weapons  at  all  times.    In  this  case,  turn  the ammunition over to the PIC.  (T-2) information  concerning 7.6.  General  Antihijacking  Guidance.  Aircrews  must  make  every  reasonable  effort  to  resist an  aircraft  hijacking  attempt,  resistance  may  vary  from  dissuasion,  to  direct  physical confrontation,  including  the  use  of  deadly  force.    Due  to  the  sensitive  nature  of  antihijacking procedures,  crew  members  should  reference  AFI  13-207,  Preventing  and  Resisting  Aircraft Piracy (Hijacking) For Official Use Only (FOUO), and the FIH for specific guidance.  Aircrews will  not  release  any those  procedures  or  hijacking  attempts.  Antihijacking is  a crew  duty performed  exclusively by  aircrew personnel.  The  hijacking of an AFSOC  aircraft  could  create  a  serious  international  incident  and  jeopardize  the  safety  of passengers  and  property.    An  aircraft  is  most  vulnerable  when  the  crew  is  on  board  and  the aircraft  is  ready  for  flight.    Hijackers  cannot  be  dealt  with  as  ordinary  criminals.    Some  are mentally  disturbed,  emotionally  unstable  individuals  for  whom  the  threat  of  death  is  not  a deterrent, but a stimulus to crime.  Delay tactics have been most successful in saving lives and property.  Detection of potential hijackers before they board the aircraft is the best solution to the problem.  (T-2) 7.6.1.  Acceptance  of  Passengers.    The  host  station  passenger  processing  and  manifesting facility should conduct antihijacking inspections.  Do not board passengers unless the PIC is fully  satisfied  with  these  inspections.    Exception:    Supporting/supported  forces  may  be antihijack inspected at the aircraft by the aircrew. 7.6.1.1.  Aeromedical Procedures.  Military medical facility commanders are responsible for the antihijacking inspection of patients.  When patients are delivered to the aircraft by civilian sources, the aircrew will perform required inspections before departure.  (T-2)   110  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 7.6.1.2.  Contingency  and  exercise  movements.    During  contingencies  in  support  of combat operations and exercises involving the movement of large numbers of personnel, the supported unit should manifest passengers and perform antihijacking inspections. 7.6.2.  Arms  and  Ammunition.    Passengers  (including  MEP)  will  not  carry  weapons  and/or ammunition  on  their  person  or  in  hand-carried  baggage  on  board  an  aircraft.    Exception:  Special  agents/guards  of  the  Secret  Service  or  State  Department,  and  other  individuals specifically authorized to carry weapons with coordination of the PIC.  In all cases the crew will be aware of location of weapons and ammunition.  (T-2) 7.6.2.1.  If individuals must  clear their weapons  before boarding the aircraft, and access to clearing barrel/facilities is limited, as a minimum, direct them to: (T-2) 7.6.2.1.1.  Move to a safe, clear area at least 50 feet from any aircraft, equipment, or personnel before un-holstering/un-slinging their weapons. 7.6.2.1.2.  Clear their weapons in accordance with standard safety procedures. 7.6.2.2.  Troops and deadhead crew members will not retain custody of ammunition on an aircraft but  will turn it in to  the troop commander or PIC.    Exception:   During  combat operations,  troops  may  carry  unloaded  weapons  and  ammunition  on  board  the  aircraft.  When  the  tactical  situation  dictates,  personnel  who  will  engage  an  enemy  force immediately  upon  deplaning  at  the  objective  may  carry  loaded  weapons  aboard  the aircraft at the discretion of the troop commander/team leader, with the PIC’s concurrence.  Weapons will not be breached until clear of the aircraft.  (T-2) 7.7.  Specific Antihijacking Guidance.  It is imperative that all crew members are familiar with the  ground  and  in-flight  resistance  actions,  covert  communications  and  forced  penetration  of unfriendly  airspace  procedures  in  AFI  13-207  and  the  FIH.    In  the  event  of  a  hijacking,  crew members  must  act  immediately  and  resourcefully,  without  instruction,  in  order  to  counter  the attacker successfully.  (T-2) AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   111  Chapter 8 OPERATIONAL REPORTS AND FORMS 8.1.  General.  This  chapter  contains  a  description  of  applicable  reports  and  forms.    For assistance in completing safety forms contact the wing/group, unit, or local flight safety officer. 8.2.  AF  Form  457,  USAF  Hazard  Report.  Refer  to  AFI  91-202,  The  USAF  Mishap Prevention  Program.    The  USAF  hazard  reporting  system  provides  a  means  for  Air  Force personnel  to  alert  supervisors  and  commanders  to  hazardous  conditions  requiring  prompt corrective  action.    A  hazard  is  any  condition,  act,  or  circumstance  that  jeopardizes  or  may jeopardize  the  health  and  wellbeing  of  personnel,  or  which  may  result  in  loss,  damage,  or destruction of any weapons system, equipment, facility, or material resource. 8.3.  AF  Form  651,  Hazardous  Air  Traffic  Report.  Refer to  AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program, Attachment 3. 8.3.1.  The Air  Force Hazardous Air Traffic Report  (HATR) program  provides a means  for personnel  to  report  all  near  midair  collisions  and  alleged  hazardous  air  traffic  conditions.  Use information in HATR reports only for mishap prevention. 8.3.2.  Procedures: 8.3.2.1.  Make an airborne report of the hazardous condition to the nearest ATC agency (e.g.,  center,  FSS,  control  tower,  or  aeronautical  radio  station),  and  give  the  following information as appropriate: 8.3.2.1.1.  Identification or call sign. 8.3.2.1.2.  Time and place (radial/DME, position relative to the airfield, etc.). 8.3.2.1.3.  Altitude or flight level. 8.3.2.1.4.  Description of the other aircraft or vehicle. 8.3.2.1.5.  Include  a  verbal  statement  as  soon  as  possible  after  occurrence  that  a written HATR report will be filed upon landing.    Note:  ATC agencies (e.g., FAA, etc.) must know if an official report is being filed.  (T-2) 8.3.2.2.  File the HATR as soon as possible (within 24 hours) using any available means of  communication.    Normally,  it  should  be  filed  at  the  base  operations  office  at  the landing  airport.  If  this  is  impractical  and  if  communications  permit,  notify  the  safety office of the Air Force base where the condition occurred, the safety office at the home station, or as prescribed by the overseas MAJCOM.  In any case, provide the safety office with  all  available  information  needed  to  prepare  AF  Form  651,  Hazardous  Air  Traffic Report.    Turn  in  a  completed  copy  of  AF Form 651  to  the  wing/group  safety  office.   Note:    HATR  reports  are  not  privileged  information  and  may  be  released  outside  the USAF. 8.3.3.  Individuals  submitting  a  HATR  are  granted  immunity  from  disciplinary  action provided: 8.3.3.1.  Their violation was not deliberate.   112  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 8.3.3.2.  They committed no criminal offense. 8.3.3.3.  No mishap occurred. 8.3.3.4.  They properly reported the incident using the above procedures. 8.4.  AF  Form  711B,  USAF  Aircraft  Mishap  Report  Worksheet.  Refer  to  AFI  91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports. 8.4.1.  Responsibilities.  Notify the appropriate authorities of any mishap involving aircraft or crew.    When  notified,  AFSOC  units  will  initiate  investigative  and  reporting  actions  in accordance with AFI 91-204.  (T-2)    Note:  Do not attempt to classify a mishap. 8.4.2.  Reportable Mishaps: 8.4.2.1.  Report damage to the aircraft, or injury to the crew or passengers; as well as any damage  or  injury  to  another  organization’s  equipment  or  personnel  resulting  from  the movements or actions of an aircraft or crew. 8.4.2.2.  Report the following occurrences: 8.4.2.2.1.  A  physiological  episode.    A  physiological  reaction,  near  accident,  or hazard  in-flight  due  to  medical  or  physiological  reasons.        Note:    In  the  event  of  a physiological  episode,  all  crew  members  and  passengers  involved  will  report  to  a flight surgeon as soon as practical.    Reportable incidents include: 8.4.2.2.1.1.  Proven or suspected case of hypoxia. 8.4.2.2.1.2.  Carbon monoxide poisoning or other toxic exposure. 8.4.2.2.1.3.

All  cases  of  departure  from  intended  takeoff  or  landing  surface  onto adjacent surfaces. 8.4.2.2.9.  Any incident which does not meet the established criteria for a reportable mishap  but,  in  the  judgment  of  the  PIC,  needs  to  be  emphasized  in  the  interest  of flight safety. 8.5.  Reports  of  Violations/Unusual  Events  or  Circumstances.  Violations  identified  in AFI 11-202, Vol 3, and navigation errors (including overwater position errors exceeding 24 nm, border, and ATC violations) will be reported. 8.5.1.  Include the following:  factual circumstances, investigation and analysis, findings and conclusions, recommendations, and actions taken. 8.5.1.1.  Attachments  should  include;  notification  of  incident,  crew  orders,  statement  of crew members (if applicable), and documenting evidence (logs, charts, etc.). 8.5.2.  In addition to the information listed, the historical flight plan will be downloaded onto a floppy disk and turned in to the C2 center or owning standardization and evaluation office. 8.5.3.  The  following  OPREP-3,  Event  or  Incident  Report,  reporting  procedures  for  all aircraft notified of navigational errors exceeding 24 nm will be reported under AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting: 8.5.3.1.  On  notification  of  a  navigational  position  error,  the  PIC  (or  agency  receiving notification)  documents  the  circumstances  surrounding  the  incident  (report  content below) and ensures submission of an OPREP-3 report through C2 channels. 8.5.3.2.  Include the following: 8.5.3.2.1.  Name  and  location  of  unit  submitting  report,  mission  identification number, reference to related OPREPs-3, type of event (e.g., state "navigation position error."), date, time (Zulu), and location (e.g., Air Route Traffic Control Center area). 8.5.3.2.2.

Include  aircraft  type  and  tail number,  unit  (wing/group  or  squadron  assignment  of  crew),  home  base,  route  of flight, point of alleged deviation, and miles off course. 8.5.3.2.3.  PICs must keep the appropriate agencies apprised of any unusual events or circumstances  impacting  their  missions.    Examples  of  reportable  events  include meaconing, jamming, intrusion, interception, fuel dumping, loss of multiple engines, hostile  fire,  injury  to  passengers  or  crew  members,  etc.    This  list  is  not  exhaustive.    114  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 Some  events  may  require  the  C2  agency  to  forward  OPREP  reports  to  higher headquarters.  The old adage, "when in doubt, report it," applies.  (T-2) 8.6.  Petroleum,  Oil,  and  Lubricants  (POL)  -  Aviation  Fuels  Documentation.  This  section prescribes  Aviation  Petroleum,  Oil,  and  Lubricants  (AVPOL)  procedures  that  ensure  correct documentation,  form  and  invoice  processing,  and  program  supervision.    Reference  DoDM 4140.25-M,  DoD  Management  of  Bulk  Petroleum  Products.    Use  the  Multiservice  Corporation (MSC)  air  card  for  the  purchase  of  aviation  fuel  and  ancillary  ground  services  at  commercial airports (and some military installations) worldwide.  The air card is authorized for use by all US government  aircraft,  state,  and  local  law  enforcement  aircraft,  and  some  foreign  government aircraft.    All  PICs  should  plan  to  use  the  platinum  MSC  card.    In  most  cases,  there  will  be  no changes when refueling at non-Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) contract locations.  The MSC card is accepted at approximately 4,800 locations worldwide.  A list of all MSC-accepting merchants can be found at https://www.airseacard.com.  It replaces the Standard Form (SF) 44, Purchase Order-Invoice-Voucher, at locations that accept the MSC card. 8.6.1.  Responsibilities.    Aircrew  and  maintenance  personnel  will  be  familiar  with  AVPOL procedures and documentation requirements of this chapter.  Improper use of the MSC card could create financial liability for the purchaser.  (T-2) 8.6.2.  Refuel/defuel  USAF aircraft at  DoD locations  whenever possible.

This  chapter  outlines  requirements  and  restrictions  for  training  and  evaluation to  AFI  11-202V1,  Aircrew  Training,  AFI  11-202V2,  Aircrew missions. Standardization/Evaluation  Program,  AFI  11-2MC-130JV1,  MC-130J  Aircrew  Training,  and AFI 11-2MC-130JV2, MC-130J Aircrew Evaluation Criteria for additional information.   Refer 9.2.  Instructor/Flight Examiner Briefings.  Before all training/evaluation missions, the PIC or instructors/flight  examiners  will  brief  their  crew  on  the  training/evaluation  requirements, objectives, planned profiles, and seat changes.  (T-2) 9.3.  Debriefing.  Review and assess overall training performed.  Each student or crew member should thoroughly understand what training has been accomplished.  All required documentation should be completed as expeditiously as possible. 9.4.  Simulated Emergency Flight Procedures (EPs). 9.4.1.  Simulate EPs (engine shutdown, placing switches in other than their normal positions, or  an  abnormal  configuration  such  as  no  flap  landings  or  simulated  engine  failure)  only during training, evaluation, or currency flights when an instructor or flight examiner pilot is in one of the pilot seats.  Instructor pilot candidates who occupy a pilot seat and are under the supervision of a flight examiner pilot, not in a pilot seat, may practice simulated emergency procedures  during  initial  or  requalification  upgrade  evaluations.    Preface  all  simulated emergencies  with  the  word  "simulated"  and  terminate  simulated  emergencies  if  an  actual emergency arises. 9.4.2.  One power lever may be retarded to FLIGHT IDLE at not less than Vmca (one-engine inoperative  out of ground effect) and not less than 300 feet AGL. 9.4.3.  Turns  into  the  simulated  inoperative  engine(s)  should  be  minimized.    Such  turns require a higher degree of pilot skill than with actual inoperative engines and must be smooth and  coordinated.    WARNING:    Improper  rudder  or  power  application  can  lead  to  an immediate out- of-control condition where recovery may not be possible.  (T-2) 9.4.4.  Simulated  EPs  are  prohibited  with  passengers  on  board  unless  such  personnel  are required for mission accomplishment, such as FCFs and test missions.  Limit personnel to the absolute minimum required. 9.4.5.  Conduct  simulated  EPs  in  accordance  with  AFI  11-202,  Vol  3,  Chapter  5,  and  this instruction.  Use a realistic EP scenario and do not compound EPs.  Limit simulated EPs to noncritical  phases  of  flight  when  possible.    Notify  the  controlling  agency  if  a  nonstandard traffic pattern or pattern requiring special sequencing is anticipated. 9.5.  Maneuver Restrictions.  All the following maneuvers discussed in Paragraph 9.5 require an instructor or flight examiner pilot unless otherwise specified. 9.5.1.  Simulated  Engine-Out  Takeoff.

Any pilot from either seat provided an instructor pilot, instructor pilot candidate on initial  or requalification instructor  evaluation, or  flight  examiner pilot  is  in  the other seat. 9.6.1.3.  If the PIC is touch-and-go certified and is touch-and-go designated on the flight orders,  any  current  and  qualified  pilot  may  conduct  flight  idle  touch-and-go  landings.  NVG  touch-and-  go  landings  may  be  performed  by  current  and  NVG  landing  qualified pilots. 9.6.2.  Touch-and-go landings are authorized when crosswind component corrected for RCR is  within  the  recommended  zone  of  the  landing  crosswind  chart.    Ceiling  and  visibility (RVR) must be at least 300 feet and 3/4-mile (40).  (T-2) 9.6.3.  Touch-and  go  landings  are  normally  performed  at  flight  idle.    Brief  the  crew  if performing a ground idle touch-and-go landing.  Do not perform no-flap ground idle touch-and- go landings. 9.6.4.  Touch-and-go landings are not authorized when normal wake turbulence criteria is not met  or  when  intercepting  or  crossing  the  flight  path  of  a  large  multi-engine  jet  during approach or landing. 9.6.5.  Minimum runway length for 50% flap flight idle touch-and-go landings is 5,000 feet.  Minimum runway length for all other touch-and-go landings is 6,000 feet. 9.7.  Stop-and-Go Landings. 9.7.1.  Authorized only on designated training, evaluation, or currency missions.  Any MC-130 qualified pilot may perform stop-and-go landings if: 9.7.1.1.  The  crosswind  component  corrected  for  RCR  is  within  the  recommended  zone of the landing crosswind chart.  Ceiling and visibility (RVR) must be at least 300 feet and 3/4-mile (40).  (T-2) 9.7.1.2.  Minimum braking is used to stop. 9.7.1.3.  The runway remaining for takeoff is greater than CFL. 9.7.2.  Stop-and-go landings are not authorized: 9.7.2.1.  In conjunction with no-flap landings. 9.7.2.2.

Landing  Restrictions  with  Airdrop  Loads.  Pilot  proficiency/multiple/maximum  effort landings  will  not  be  accomplished  with  non-unilateral  airdrop  loads  onboard  the  aircraft  (i.e., Combat  Rubber  Raiding  Craft  (CRRC),  Bike  Bundles,  Rigging  Alternate  Method  Zodiac (RAMZ)) in order to prevent damage to actual loads.  If landings are accomplished with training loads  (i.e.,  SATB,  55  gallon  drum  CDS  loads,  concrete  blocks)  on  the  aircraft,  the  loadmaster will reinspect the load prior to airdrop.  If any damage is noted on the honeycomb, skid board, ties,  lashings,  etc.,  the  load  will  be  returned  to  Aerial  Delivery.    Training  loads  may  remain onboard during assault landings and may be dropped after they are reinspected by the loadmaster prior  to  the  airdrop.    The  intent  is  not  to  negatively  impact  training,  but  at  the  same  time, minimize maximum effort landings with training loads on board.  (T-2) 9.10.  Simulated  Instrument  Flight.  Simulated  instrument  flight  may  be  flown  and  logged without use of a vision-restricting device.  The use of a hood or other artificial vision-restricting device for any phase of flight is prohibited. 9.11.  Air-to-Air  Refueling  Training  Restrictions.  During  training  missions  the  override signal amplifier will not be used.   122  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 Chapter 10 LOCAL OPERATING PROCEDURES 10.1.  General.

The  title  will  indicate  the  unit  concerned (e.g., “10.2.  522  Special Operations Squadron Local Operating Procedures.”) (T-2) 10.1.1.  Procedures in this chapter will not duplicate, alter, amend or be less restrictive than those in this instruction.  (T-2) 10.1.2.  After validation, send final copies to HQ AFSOC/A3V. AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   123  Chapter 11 NAVIGATION PROCEDURES 11.1.  General. 11.1.1.  Definitions and Terminology. 11.1.1.1.  Category I (CAT I) Route.  Any route that does not meet the requirements of a CAT II route, including tactical navigation and overwater routes. 11.1.1.2.  Category  II  (CAT  II)  Route.    Any  route  on  which  the  position  of  the  aircraft can  be  accurately  determined  by  the  overhead  crossing  of  a  radio  aid  (NDB,  VOR)  or intersection  of  at  least  two  radio  aid  radials  (VOR,  TACAN)  or  one  radial  (VOR, TACAN) and one DME at least once each hour. 11.1.1.3.  Controlling  Navigation  Solution.    The  controlling  EGI  (INAV)  navigation solution  the  mission  computer  is  using  for  en  route  navigation.    The  SHIP  SOLN, selected via the NAV SELECT page of the AMU, determines which will be used to steer the aircraft either manually or with the autopilot.  (T-2) 11.1.1.4.  First  Suitable Airfield (FSAF) and  Last  Suitable Airfield (LSAF).  Utilized in the equal time point (ETP) calculation.  These are represented as the “First Nearest” and the “Last Nearest” airports in the ETP calculation in the PROGRESS pages of  the CNI.  They  are  airports  closest  to  the  coast  out  and  coast  in  waypoints  that  meet  applicable criteria  for  C-130J  operations.    Forecast  weather  for  the  FSAF  and  LSAF  must  meet destination weather minimum filing requirements.  (T-2) 11.1.1.5.  Equal  Time  Point  (ETP).    Geographic  point  along  the  route  from  which  the flight time to the FSAF or the LSAF is equal. 11.1.1.6.  Required Navigation Performance (RNP).  RNP accuracy standards require an aircraft  to  remain  within  a  specific  number  of  nautical  miles  of  its  cleared  course centerline for 95% of the duration of the flight.  The associated track containment limit is twice the RNP value and represents the maximum limit of protected airspace.  Airspace where RNP is applied is considered special qualification airspace.  Both the operator and the specific aircraft type must be approved for operations in these areas.  RNP airspace is being  incorporated  around  the  world  to  increase  air  traffic  capacity  by  decreasing separation requirements between routes.  Refer to FLIP Area Planning publications/charts to determine RNP airspace.  (T-2) 11.1.1.7.  Minimum  Navigation  Performance  Specifications  (MNPS)  Airspace.    MNPS airspace exists in both the North Atlantic Region (NAT) and certain Canadian portions of the  North  American  Region.    Refer  to  FLIP  Area  Planning  publications/charts  to determine  MNPS  airspace.    The  C-130J  must  comply  with  all  MNPS  equipment requirements when flying within the lateral dimensions of this airspace.  Aircraft meeting the  North  Atlantic  MNPS  requirements  also  meet  the  Canadian  MNPS  requirements.  Aircraft  entering  MNPS  airspace  are  required  to  have  two  Long  Range  Navigation Systems (LRNS) capable of staying within 12.6 nm of cleared track for 95 percent of the flight.  Gross navigation errors are those that exceed 24 nm from track center line.  Prior to  entering  MNPS  airspace,  both  INSs  must  be  fully  operational  to  meet  the  MNPS   124  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 requirement  of  having  two  fully  serviceable  LRNSs.    In  order  to  signify  that  a  flight  is approved to operate in NAT MNPS airspace, the letter “X” will be inserted within item 10 of the DD Form 1801 flight plan.  (T-2) 11.1.1.8.  NAT  Tracks.    Contained  within  the  North  Atlantic  MNPS  airspace  is  an organized track system (NAT Tracks) between FL 285 and FL 420 to optimize air traffic flow  between  the  North  American  and  European  continents.    NAT  tracks  are  designed based on meteorological data and are updated twice daily.  When flying over the North Atlantic, crews should obtain a copy of the North Atlantic Tracks (NAT tracks) valid for their coast out time from the DoD NOTAM internet site. 11.1.1.9.  Reduced  Vertical  Separation  Minimum  (RVSM)  Airspace.    This  airspace requires special certification and exists to increase airspace capacity, safely, by reducing vertical  separation  from  2,000  to  1,000  between  suitably  equipped  aircraft.    RVSM  has been  implemented  in  the  CONUS,  Europe,  Africa,  and  Middle  East.    RVSM  airspace typically extends from FL 290 through FL 410.  Consult AP/1 and AP/2 for locations and lateral and vertical dimensions of this airspace. 11.2.  Mission Planning Procedures. 11.2.1.  Mission/Route  Planning.    Aircrew  will  normally  accomplish  and  verify  mission planning while in a flight planning facility/base operations; the data is then loaded manually (or via the data transfer card) into the CNI.  Pilots will also calculate and verify the required ramp fuel load.  (T-2) 11.2.1.1.  When  practical,  aircrew  will  plan  the  most  direct  routing  possible  or  utilize wind optimized CFP routing to enhance fuel conservation.  (T-2) 11.2.1.2.  Computer  Flight  Plan  (CFP).    Optimized  routing  with  applied  forecast  winds can  be  obtained  from  ACFP  (USAF)  or  OPARS  (USN).    ACFP  4.0  can  produce  a Computer  Flight  Planning  Software  (CFPS)  .rte  file  that  Portable  Flight  Planning Software (PFPS) can recognize and open.  Use initial ATC cruise ceiling for the en route altitude when not restricted by fuel temperature freezing limits.  Update actual flight level winds using the N-PFPS WX utility if necessary. 11.2.1.3.  Verify the CFP for route definition and accuracy, paying particular attention to adherence with over flight clearances. 11.2.1.4.  Refer to Chapter 12 to accomplish fuel planning. 11.2.2.  Equal Time Point (ETP) Computations. 11.2.2.1.  Refer  to  Chapter  12  for  ETP  Computations.    The  ETP  provides  crews  a  tool for  recovery  airfield  decision-making  when  in-flight  emergencies  occur.   ETP computations  are  required  on  CAT  I  routes  when  the  total  time  between  the  LSAF  and FSAF  is  5  hours  or  more.    ETPs  must  be  annotated  and  plotted  on  the  MPC  and  MFP prior to the coast-out waypoint.  Computer programs which use similar algorithms as the manual  computation  may  be  used.    Enter  ETP  information  into  the  CNI  PROGRESS page  during  preflight.    CNI-computed  ETPs  only  become  accurate  upon  reaching  the PERF  CRUISE  altitude.    CNI-computed  ETPs  can  be  obtained  for  different  airspeeds (i.e., 260 KTAS for a 3-engine scenario).  (T-2) AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   125  11.2.2.2.  The blocks provided on top of the C-130J PFPS CFP should be used to record information needed by the CNI to compute an ETP.  These blocks and provided formulas also serve as a worksheet for crews to do the manual ETP computation.  The ACFP flight plan has information  on  the bottom  of the flight  plan for manual  ETP  calculations (See Figure  14.2  for  sample  CFP).    If  using  the  computer  programs  or  the  CNI,  annotate applicable  information  on  the  Master  Flight  Plan  (MFP).    If  the  CNI  is  used,  annotate “CNI” in the master flight plan blocks for which the CNI does not present a number. 11.2.2.3.  To compute a manual ETP: 11.2.2.3.1.  Identify  and  record  the  LSAF,  coast-out  point,  approximate  midpoint  of the  CAT  I  portion,  coast-in  point,  and  FSAF.    The  coast-out  point,  approximate midpoint,  and  coast-in  point  are  actual  waypoints  on  the  flight  plan.    The  coast-out point for ETP purposes must occur after initial level-off.  (T-2) 11.2.2.3.2.  Determine and record the distance from the LSAF to the FSAF (entering the two airfields and approximate midpoint into PFPS is an easy way to do this). 11.2.2.3.3.  Determine  and  record  the  average  groundspeed  (GS)  for  the  first-half (coast-out to midpoint) and second-half (midpoint to coast-in) of the CAT I portion.  Divide the respective en route distance by the en route time to/from the midpoint to determine accurate average GS. 11.2.2.3.4.  Calculate  a  wind  factor  (WF1  &  WF2)  for  each  half  by  subtracting  the flight-planned average TAS  from  the averaged GS.   If  a tailwind  is  experienced the WF will be positive.  If a headwind is experienced the WF will be negative.  (T-2) 11.2.2.3.5.  Use the provided formulas in Figure 11.1 to compute the time it takes to fly  from  the  ETP  to  the  FSAF.    Use  this  time  and  the  second-half-averaged  GS  to calculate a distance from the FSAF that the ETP occurs. Figure 11.1.  Formula to Calculate Time From ETP to FSAF. 11.2.2.3.6.  The  INDEX  FROM/TO  and  PROGRESS  pages  may  also  be  utilized in-flight to update times and distances to diversion  bases along the route of flight.  An accurate GS must be entered in order to obtain correct ETE calculations.  (T-2)    126  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 Figure 11.2.  ETP Calculations.  11.3.  Master Flight Plan and Master Plotting Chart. 11.3.1.  One CFP and one plotting chart will be used as master copies for each flight utilizing CAT I procedures.  Both will be labeled ”MASTER COPY” and will be referred to as Master Flight Plan (MFP) and Master Plotting Chart (MPC).  (T-2) 11.3.2.  MFP Usage.  The MFP is normally maintained by the CSO or PM but should be kept readily available to both pilots.  It will be used to record the following in-flight: (T-2) 11.3.2.1.  All ATC clearances and changes to clearances. 11.3.2.2.  The  wind,  temperature,  altitude,  fuels  remaining,  and  the  bearing/range between  the  INAV  solutions  over  waypoints  bordering  and  within  CAT  I  Navigation airspace. 11.3.2.3.  Any loss or degraded navigation/avionics equipment. 11.3.2.4.  Compass deviation checks. 11.3.2.5.  Oceanic Navigation Accuracy Check. 11.3.3.  MFP Symbology.  Use the following symbology to ensure that both pilots/CSO can easily  determine  which  waypoints  have  been  programmed  into  the  CNI-MU,  which programmed waypoints have been verified, and which waypoints have been transitioned in-flight. 11.3.3.1.  Place  a  check  mark  next  to  the  waypoint  to  signify  the  waypoint  has  been entered into the CNI-MU and the course and distance have been verified. AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   127  11.3.3.2.  Circle  the  check  mark  to  signify  the  coordinates,  course  and  distance  in  the CNI-MU have been verified by another crew member. 11.3.3.3.  Draw one diagonal line through the circled check mark to signify the waypoint has  been  passed,  reported,  and  all  applicable  annotations  associated  with  waypoint passage have been completed. 11.3.3.4.  Cross  the first  diagonal  line with  another to  signify that the aircraft‘s position has  been  plotted  on  the  MPC  approximately  60  nm  (10  to  15  minutes  depending  on groundspeed) after waypoint passage. 11.3.4.  MPC Usage.  The use of a plotting chart is required on every route requiring CAT I Navigation.  Use an appropriate JNCA or higher chart with Lambert Conformal Conic (LCC) projection.  During mission planning, draw the course line representing the planned route of flight  on  the  MPC  and  highlight  the  associated  suitable  emergency  airfields.    The  PIC  will verify  this  information  and  annotate  the  chart  with  his/her  signature,  date,  and  mission number/call  sign.    During  flight,  10  to  15  minutes  (depending  on  groundspeed)  after  each CAT I waypoint, the PM/CSO will Mark Position and then plot the INS-only position on the MPC  (using  a  dot  surrounded  by  a  triangle)  and  annotate  the  marked  time  and  position coordinates adjacent to the plot.  The PM/CSO should compare the plotted point to the course line.    This  procedure  confirms  that  the  navigation  system  is  steering  the  airplane  to  the correct waypoint.  (T-2) 11.4.  Preflight Procedures. 11.4.1.  Preflight  procedures  must  include  a  UTC  time  check  and  resynchronization  of  the aircraft  master  clock,  if  necessary.    Aircraft  clock  errors  resulting  in  position  report  time errors can lead to  an erosion of actual longitudinal separation between aircraft.  Acceptable time standards that can be used include GPS (corrected to UTC), Naval Observatory Master Clock (DSN 762-1401/1069 or 560-6742), and WWV (2,500, 5,000, 10,000, 15,000, 20,000 kHz).  (T2) 11.4.2.  Preflight Communications Check.  A pre-flight check of the SATCOM (if equipped) and  HF  radios  should  be  made  to  a  suitable  agency  (operating  authority,  command  post  or ATC).  At least one HF radio must be confirmed operational prior to coast out or the mission must be terminated.  (T-2) 11.4.3.  Navigation  Initialization  and  Solutions.    Both  the  AUTONAV  and  manual  GC alignment of the INSs result in the required navigation performance needed for RNP RNAV operation.  The GPS positions may be used as initial positions as long as they agree within one-tenth of one minute.  If GPS is not available, use precision parking coordinates or, as a last resort, obtain coordinates from an airfield diagram published in an approved instrument approach book.  This position must be checked and verified by both pilots and recorded on the MFP.  (T-2) 11.4.4.  Communication/Navigation/Identification  Management  System  (CNI-MS).   In addition to Chapter 5 requirements, when configuring for CAT I operations, both pilots will verify that the INAV Position Alert 1 is set to 4.0 miles and INAV Position Alert 2 is set to 8.0  miles  on  the  CNI  PROGRESS  page.    This  will  generate  an  INAV  POS  DIFFERENCE Advisory at 4.0 miles and an INAV POS MISCOMPARE Caution at 8.0 miles.  (T-2)   128  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 11.4.5.  Loading the Route of Flight.  Because CAT I routes usually involve the manual input of waypoints not found in the database, and often require aircraft maximum range capability, it is critical that both pilots and CSO work in sequence and independently to  enter accurate route-of-flight data.  It is not sufficient for one crew member to simply observe another crew member entering the data.  The following steps will be completed by the pilots and CSO: (T-2) 11.4.5.1.  The CSO or one of the pilots will: (T-2) 11.4.5.1.1.  Load  the  route  of  flight  directly  from  the  filed  flight  plan,  MFP  or  data transfer card into the CNI and verify both the magnetic course and the leg distance for each  waypoint  with  the  MFP.    Loading  the  route  directly  from  the  filed  flight  plan may  minimize  pilot/controller  clearance  loop  (misinterpretation)  errors.    Label waypoints so they can be readily identified for subsequent position reporting.  If the courses  differ  by  more  than  2°  or  the  distances  differ  by  more  than  2  nm,  the  pilot will resolve the discrepancy prior to flight.  Completion of this step will be annotated with a check mark next to the waypoint. 11.4.5.1.2.  Using  the  LEGS  pages,  insert  the  forecast  winds  (if  available)  at  each waypoint. 11.4.5.1.3.  Verify the total distance to the destination on the CNI PROGRESS page.  Any significant disparity (more than 25 nm to allow for SIDs/STARs and approaches) in  the  total  distance  between  the  CNI  and  MFP  will  require  a  recheck  of  the  ramp position and waypoint coordinates. 11.4.5.2.  The  other  pilot  or  CSO  will  verify  the  waypoint  coordinates  and  course  and distance  information  from  the  opposite  side  CNI  to  the  MFP.    Completion  of  this  step will be annotated with the check mark being circled on the MFP.  (T-2) 11.4.5.3.  If  the  planned  route  of  flight  is  a  stored  route  or  one  loaded  during  a  data transfer,  verification  of  waypoint  coordinates  must  still  be  accomplished  by  both pilots/CSO in the same manner.  (T-2) 11.5.  CAT I Navigation Procedures. 11.5.1.  This  section  provides  general  procedures  and  guidance  for  the  operation  of navigation  systems  on  CAT  I  routes.    For  navigation  system  requirements,  consider  all oceanic  airspace  as  MNPS  airspace.    Specific  procedures  for  RNP  RNAV  airspace  are addressed in subsequent sections. 11.5.2.  Refer to Chapter  4 for the navigation Minimum Equipment  List (MEL) for CAT I and RNP RNAV operations. 11.5.3.  Navigation System Accuracy Checks. 11.5.3.1.  Ground.  After leaving the ramp, perform the INS/INAV groundspeed check by stopping  the  aircraft  and  checking  each  pilot‘s  groundspeed  on  the  CNI-MUs  or HDDs/HUDs.    Groundspeeds  in  excess  of  1  knot  while  the  aircraft  is  stationary  may indicate a faulty INS. 11.5.3.2.  Airborne.    Determine  INAV  position  accuracy  by  comparing  it  to  en  route NAVAIDs. AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   129  11.5.3.3.  Compass  Deviation  Check.    Perform  a  compass  deviation  check  using  both INSs  and  the  standby  compass  prior  to  entering  CAT  I  airspace.    Perform  subsequent checks after heading changes of 30° (or greater) or every 3 hours.  Record the deviation in  the  appropriate  block  of  the  MFP.    Apply  this  correction  to  headings  to  be  flown whenever it is necessary to use the standby compass as the sole source for navigation. 11.5.3.4.  Oceanic Navigation Accuracy Check.  Prior to coast-out, evaluate/compare the accuracy of all navigation solutions. In the event of discrepancies, greater than 4 nm, the crew should investigate the cause and determine if CAT I flight is feasible.  Record this gross  error  check  in  the  appropriate  block  of  the  MFP.    If  a  pure  INS  position  is determined  to  be  more  than  4  miles  in  error,  an  in-flight  alignment  (IFA)  may  be accomplished  provided  sufficient  time  is  available  prior  to  entering  RNP  RNAV  or oceanic airspace.  If coast-out is made at a radial/DME fix, the appropriate radial should be  selected  on  the  non-active  CDI  as  a  further  check  that  the  navigation  system  is tracking to the fix. 11.5.4.  Communications.  In addition to guidance in Chapter  5, crews will accomplish the following: (T-2) 11.5.4.1.  Emergency Frequency Monitoring.  In the interest of safety during oceanic and remote  area  operations  (100  nm  offshore),  flights  should  maintain  a  listening  watch  on 121.5 and 243.0 MHz and the VHF common frequency. 11.5.4.2.  BIU Backup.  Ensure that one of the pilots place their transmission switch to an HF  radio  so  that  the  crew  can  transmit  on  HF  in  case  of  BIU  Backup.    The  other  pilot should  select  VHF  2  for  the  same  reason.    VHF  1  will  be  available  on  the  Get  Home Control and crew can attempt to relay transmissions to other aircraft on 121.5 until within VHF range of ATC. 11.5.5.  Oceanic Clearance:    If not  received before takeoff, the  oceanic  clearance should be obtained prior to the boundary of oceanic airspace IAW FLIP. 11.5.5.1.  The clearance will be recorded on the MFP, and reviewed by both pilots/CSO.  If  the  oceanic  clearance  received  is  different  from  the  planned  clearance,  use  the following procedures: (T-2) 11.5.5.1.1.  Record  the  new  route  on  the  MFP  to  include  applicable  updates  to  ETP data. 11.5.5.1.2.  Enter  the  new  waypoints  into  the  CNI  in  accordance  with  the  preflight procedures in this chapter. 11.5.5.1.3.  Ensure  fuel  will  still  be  sufficient  to  arrive  at  the  destination  waypoint with required reserves. 11.5.5.1.4.  Mark out the old plotted track and draw the revised plot on the MPC. 11.5.5.1.5.  In no case should this process simultaneously engage the attention of both pilots during flight. 11.5.6.  Approaching Coast-Out.  Prior to coast-out and outside of RNP RNAV airspace it is permissible and recommended to use the EGI or GPS (INAV source in AUTO mode) as the INAV solution for both CNI-SPs if NAVAIDs are available for monitoring.  Prior to losing   130  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 NAVAID reception, the INAV solution that is not the controlling solution must be placed to INS.  This ensures there is constant comparison of the controlling solution to an independent INS solution.  Beginning at the coast-out waypoint and continuing through coast-in, CNI-MU bearing/range  between  INAV  solutions  should  be  recorded  at  each  waypoint  to  provide  a running record of INS drift relative to the controlling solution.  (T-2) 11.5.7.  IFF.  Reset Mode 3A code to 2,000, 30 minutes after entering Category I airspace. 11.5.8.  MFP and MPC Procedures. 11.5.8.1.  After  takeoff,  record  the  takeoff  time  in  the  Actual  Time  of  Arrival  (ATA) block of the departure airfield on the MFP.  As soon as practical after takeoff, determine a revised Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) for each line of the MFP using flight-planned leg times and the actual departure time. 11.5.8.2.  Prior  to  waypoint  transition,  check  the  MFP  magnetic  course  and  distance  to the  next  waypoint  against  the  CNI-MU.    The  courses  should  be  within  2º  and  the distances should agree within approximately 2 nm. Check and verify that the subsequent waypoint is properly programmed.  Update ETAs to the next two waypoints. 11.5.8.3.  Overhead  the  waypoint,  confirm  the  ATA  and  determine  the  minutes ahead/behind by  comparing it to  the ETA.  Record the CNI-MU bearing/range between INAV  solutions  to  provide  a  running  record  of  INS  drift  relative  to  the  controlling solution.  Record the actual fuel remaining above the flight-planned continuation fuel and write the difference between continuation fuel and actual fuel remaining in the EXCESS block  of  the  MPF.    See  the  in-flight  fuel  management  section  of  Chapter  12  for additional guidance and definitions. 11.5.8.4.  Immediately after waypoint passage, and as soon as the aircraft has intercepted its new course, confirm that the aircraft is outbound on its flight planned magnetic course to the next waypoint and record the bearing/range between INAV solutions found on the INAV 1/3 page. 11.5.8.5.  Record the actual in-flight conditions (altitude, wind, and static air temperature (SAT))  above  the  forecast  conditions  on  the  next  line  of  the  MFP.    Update  these conditions as well as fuel flow as needed on the PERF CRUISE and LEGS pages in the CNI-MU. 11.5.8.6.  If required, complete a position report to the controlling agency in accordance with FIH procedures.  The layout of the CNI PROGRESS page supports the format of the position  report;  however,  ensure  that  ETAs  passed  to  the  controlling  agency  match  the ETAs on the MFP.  This will enable the pilots to determine if an ETA has changed from what  was  previously  reported.    If  an  ETA  changes  by  more  than  3  minutes,  notify  the controlling agency.  (T-2) 11.5.8.7.  Draw a diagonal line through the waypoint on the MFP to indicate it has been passed,  reported,  and  all  applicable  annotations  associated  with  waypoint  passage  have been completed. 11.5.8.8.  Approximately  60  nm  (10  to  15  minutes  depending  on  groundspeed)  after waypoint  passage,  MARK  the  aircraft  position  and  plot  the  INS-only  position  on  the MPC.    Record  the  mark  time  and  position  coordinates  next  to  the  plot.    If  the  plotted AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   131  position  is  not  within  2  nm  of  the  course  centerline,  check  waypoint  coordinates  for accuracy, ensure the autopilot is tracking correctly in NAV mode, recheck the accuracy of the charted course-line, and recheck that the position was plotted correctly. 11.5.8.9.  Cross  the  first  diagonal  on  the  MFP  to  indicate  that  the  aircraft  position  has been plotted. 11.5.8.10.  When the frequency of waypoints along CAT I route segments is greater than one every thirty minutes, full-line entries and plotting can be limited to a minimum of one every hour.  Full-line entries with the corresponding position plot are required for every waypoint involving a change of heading over 20°. 11.5.9.  Routine Monitoring 11.5.9.1.  Because  of the altitude/steering modes, regular checks of correct engagement with the navigation system should be made. the  autopilot  disconnecting  from the  possibility  of 11.5.9.2.  Crews  should  monitor  aircraft  performance  and  outside  parameters,  suspect potential problem areas, and review the performance manual if the following conditions are encountered: 11.5.9.2.1.  The fuel remaining is less that the planned continuation fuel. 11.5.9.2.2.  Any Low Calculated Fuel CNI-MU advisory. 11.5.9.2.3.  ATA at any MFP fix is off by more than ± 5 minutes. 11.5.9.2.4.  SAT differs by more than ± 5º C from flight planned. 11.5.9.2.5.  Actual winds differ by more than 30º or 15 knots from flight-planned. 11.5.9.2.6.  Any Ahead/Behind Time more than 10% of total planned en route time to that point. 11.5.9.2.7.  Hazardous meteorological conditions. 11.5.10.  Approaching Landfall.  Use the radar to help identify the coast-in position.  When the  aircraft  is  approaching  the  first  landfall  NAVAID,  tune  and  identify  the  navigation facility  and  cross-check  the  aircraft  position.    If  coast-in  is  made  at  a  radial/DME  fix,  the appropriate  radial  should  be  selected  on  the  non-active  CDI  as  a  further  check  that  the navigation system is tracking according to the current clearance.  Once NAVAID reception is assured and flight is not being conducted in RNP RNAV airspace, all INAV solutions can be returned  to  AUTO.    If  entering  BRNAV  airspace,  AUTOTUNE  the  NAVAIDS,  select INS/RAD as the controlling solution, and place the other INAV solution in AUTO.  Revert to CAT II procedures. Reset POS ALERT and IFF Mode 3 as appropriate. 11.6.  Special Certification Airspace Requirements and Procedures. 11.6.1.  The  GPS  currently  installed  in  the  C-130J  navigation  suite  does  not  meet  FAA certification requirements for IFR navigation.  AFI 11-202, Vol3, allows the GPS to be used as a mission enhancement system for en route instrument navigation, if it is used to update a self-contained navigation system, such  as  INS  or  mission computer, and is checked  against other approved sources (in this case an RNP-10 certified INS).  Therefore, on CAT II routes (not  including  operations  in  BRNAV  airspace),  the  EGI  or  GPS  can  be  used  as  the   132  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 controlling  solution  for  en  route  instrument  navigation  if  NAVAIDs  are  available  for monitoring.    The  NAVAIDs  must  be  operational  and  actively  monitored.    If  deviations  are observed,  crews  should  revert  to  navigation  via  ground  based  NAVAIDs.    For  operations over  CAT  I  routes  (not  including  operations  in  RNP-10  airspace),  the  EGI  or  GPS  can  be used  as  the  controlling  solution  providing  the  pilot  can  monitor  its  performance  using  the offside  INS  as  an  independent  navigation  source.    The  EGI  or  GPS  cannot  be  used  as  the controlling solution in BRNAV or RNP-10 airspace, even when using INS as the sole input source for the EGI.  (T-2) 11.6.2.  The C-130J is certified for RNP-10 and Basic RNAV (BRNAV)/RNP-5 airspace, but with operational time restrictions.  These certifications are based on raw INS data. 11.6.2.1.  RNP-10  airspace  requires  a  track  keeping  accuracy  of  10  nm  for  95%  of  the flight.    The  track  containment  limit  is  20  nm.    The  C-130J  navigation  system  has  been certified to meet the requirements of RNP-10 airspace for up to 10 hours from the time the  controlling  INS  was  commanded  to  the  NAV  mode.    The  pure  INS  solution  is  the only  certified  navigation  solution  for  flying  in  this  airspace.    Annotate  the  letter  “R”  in Block 10 of the DD Form 1801 or appropriate block of the ICAO flight plan to indicate RNP-10 certification. 11.6.2.2.  BRNAV/RNP-5 airspace requires a track keeping accuracy of 5 nm for 95% of the flight.  The track containment limit is 10 nm.  Minimum equipment to operate in this airspace is one INS capable of updates.  The INS/RAD or INS-only solution will be the controlling INAV solution in this airspace.  The INS/RAD solution can be used without time  restrictions  if  the  solution  is  being  updated  from  NAVAIDs.    If  the  NAVAIDs become unreliable, either through radio failure or denial, the INS-only solution will still maintain  BRNAV  accuracy  for  2.6  hours  from  the  time  the  controlling  INS  was commanded to the NAV mode.  If needed, an in-flight alignment may be used to restart the  time-in-NAV  of  an  INS  prior  to  entry  into  this  airspace.    INS/RAD  or  INS-only solution will be selected prior to entering BRNAV airspace.  The AUTOTUNE function of  the  CNI-MS  must  be  enabled.    BRNAV  airspace  currently  exists  throughout  the European  Region.    Because  BRNAV  airspace  exists  only  where  NAVAID  reception  is available, CAT I procedures are not required.  Annotate the letter “R” in Block 10 of the DD  Form  1801  or  appropriate  block  of  the  ICAO  flight  plan  to  indicate  BRNAV certification.  (T-2) 11.6.3.  Reduced  Vertical  Separation  Minimum  (RVSM)  Airspace.    Airspace  where  RVSM is  applied  is  considered  special  qualification  airspace.    Both  the  operator  and  the  specific aircraft type must be approved for operations in these areas.  Pilots will refer to FLIP AP/2 and the following for RVSM requirements: (T-2) 11.6.3.1.  Both primary altimeters, at least one autopilot, the altitude advisory system, and the transponder, must be fully operational.  The AC will request a new clearance to avoid this airspace should any of this equipment fail.  (T-2) 11.6.3.2.  Have  the  autopilot  engaged  during  level  cruise,  except  when  circumstances such as the need to re-trim the aircraft or turbulence require disengagement. 11.6.3.3.  Cross-check  the  altimeters  before  or  immediately  upon  coast  out.    Record readings of both altimeters. AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   133  11.6.3.4.  Continuously  cross-check  the  primary  altimeters  to  ensure  they  agree  ±  200 feet. 11.6.3.5.  Limit  climb  and  descent  rates  to  1,000  feet  per  minute  when  operating  near other aircraft to reduce potential TCAS advisories. 11.6.3.6.  Immediately notify ATC if any of the required equipment fails after entry into RVSM airspace and coordinate a plan of action. 11.6.3.7.  Document  in  the  aircraft  forms  malfunctions  or  failures  of  RVSM  required equipment. 11.7.  Navigation Malfunctions and Failures. 11.7.1.  Should INAV solutions noticeably separate and exceed 8 nm, determine and use the INS  solution  considered  most  accurate  by  evaluating  both  INSs  using  available  radio  aids, ground mapping radar, and GPS.  Highest validity should be given to positions referenced via radar.  Next highest validity should be given to positions derived via radio aid fixing.  When left to determine the most probable position (MPP) via navigation solution comparisons, two agreeing INS positions are more valid than two agreeing GPSs; and two agreeing GPSs and one agreeing INS indicate a probable INS problem.  Consider INS-radar/NAVAID, INS-INS, and  INS-GPS  position  comparisons  that  are  less  than  4  nm  difference  to  be  valid  and  in agreement.   Once the most accurate  INS  is  determined, select  it as the controlling solution.  Update ETAs to ATC if required. 11.7.2.  Situations  may  arise  when  crews  cannot  identify  the  faulty  navigation  system  by simple  comparison  of  positions  between  navigation  solutions.    Fly  the  aircraft  halfway between  the  disagreeing  INS  solutions.    Plot  both  CNI-SP  solutions  at  least  once  every  30 minutes on the MPC, labeling the pilot CNI-SP navigation solution MPP1 and the copilot’s MPP2.    Continue  to  evaluate  outputs  from  each  INS  and  try  to  use  plotted  position information to identify adverse trends. 11.7.3.  Malfunctions and failures in MNPS airspace: 11.7.3.1.  Crews  experiencing  deterioration  or  failure  of  navigation  equipment  that reduces  the  capability  to  comply  with  MNPS  prior  to  MNPS  entry  will  return  to  a suitable airfield with a maintenance repair facility.  (T-2) 11.7.3.2.  Crews experiencing deterioration or failure of navigation equipment after entry into MNPS airspace should immediately report the malfunction to the controlling agency and  subsequent  agencies  throughout  the  route  of  flight.    Once  the  aircraft  has  entered oceanic  airspace, the PIC should continue to  operate the aircraft in  accordance with  the Oceanic  Clearance  already  received,  appreciating  that  the  reliability  of  the  total navigation  system  has  been  significantly  reduced.    The  PIC  should  also  prepare  a proposal to ATC with respect to the prevailing circumstances and consult with ATC as to the most suitable action. 11.7.3.3.  If an aircraft in MNPS airspace is unable to continue flight in accordance with its ATC clearance for reasons such as severe turbulence, aircraft performance problems, or pressurization failure, a revised clearance should  be obtained  as soon  as possible.   If unable  to  obtain  a  new  clearance,  offset  30  nm  from  the  assigned  route  by  turning  90°   134  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 from track and maintain altitude if possible.  Once offset 30 nm, climb or descend to an altitude which differs from those normally used by 500 feet. 11.7.4.  Malfunctions and failures in RNP-10 or BRNAV airspace: 11.7.4.1.  Aircraft unable to maintain RNP-10 or BRNAV RNAV tolerances must advise controlling agency immediately and take appropriate coordinated action.  (T-2) AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   135  Chapter 12 FUEL PLANNING 12.1.  General.  A  fuel  plan  is  required  for  all  flights  except  local  area  flights  with  established standard fuel  loads.  The CFPS Computer Flight  Plan (CFP) and 1C-130(M)J-1-1 Performance Manual  are  the  primary  method  of  fuel  planning.    All  preflight  planning  must  be  verified  with aircraft mission computer (MC) performance prior to departure.  Missions should be planned at altitudes, routes, and airspeeds to minimize fuel usage.  (T-2) 12.1.1.  MC-130J Management.  All MC-130J flight operations will use fuel planning and en route  fuel  management  procedures.    (T-2)        Note:    The  flight  planning  computer configuration  is  approved  by  AFSOC  and  the  Special  Operations  Mission  Planning  Office.  Uncertified,  untested,  or  beta  versions  of  developing  software  will  not  be  used  for  actual mission planning.  (T-2) 12.2.  Definitions.  The  following  definitions  apply  to  fuel  planning,  and  take  precedence  over similar definitions published elsewhere. 12.2.1.  CAT  1  Route:    Any  route  that  does  not  meet  the  requirements  of  a  CAT  II  route, including tactical navigation and overwater routes. 12.2.2.  Contingency Fuel:  An identified extra to compensate for unforeseen circumstances during any phase of flight (i.e. unforecasted weather, launch delay, etc.). 12.2.3.  Required  Ramp  Fuel  Load  (RRFL):    Minimum  fuel  required  at  engine  start  to complete tasked mission. 12.2.4.  Depressurization Fuel:  Additional fuel required to protect the aircraft and occupants in  the  event  of  a  cabin  depressurization  followed  by  an  extended  diversion  to  an  alternate airport at low-altitude where fuel consumption is increased. 12.2.5.  Tankered  Fuel:    Additional  fuel  carried  through  a  primary  destination  for  use  on  a subsequent leg. 12.2.6.  Wing  Relieving  Fuel:    Additional  fuel  kept  in  the  main  tanks  intended  to  counter wing bending moments and keep the aircraft within flight manual weight limitations. 12.3.  Alternate  Selection.  Plan  fuel  to  an  alternate  only  when  AFI  11-202,  Vol  3,  or AFI 112MC130J, Vol 3, require the filing of an alternate. 12.3.1.  When only one alternate is required, use the closest suitable airfield meeting mission requirements  (such  as  special  requirements  for  hazmat  or  patients)  and  AFI  11-202,  Vol  3, weather criteria. 12.3.2.  If  two  alternates  are  required,  use  the  two  closest  suitable  airfields  meeting AFI 11202, Vol 3, weather criteria and fuel plan to the more distant of the two. 12.3.3.  When selecting an alternate, suitable military airfields are preferred if within 75 nm of destination. 12.4.  Fuel  Planning  Profiles.  En  route  cruise  airspeed  normally  should  be  planned  at  a constant TAS IAW the performance manual.  Missions planned using Long Range Cruise (LRC) provide  little  flexibility  in  the  air  when  faced  with  actual  fuel  critical  situations  requiring  the   136  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 conservation of additional fuel.  Divert profiles should be fully fuel planned and represent what will  actually  be  flown.    Altitudes  should  be  no  higher  than  the  ATC  cruise  ceiling  per  the performance manual or fuel freezing temperature limitations, whichever is lower. 12.4.1.  CFPS CFP Planning Profile.  The C-130J performance module of PFPS is certified to calculate  accurate  fuel  planning  information.    Crews  should  use  the  C130JHI.frm  or C130JHI.xls  form  when  printing  the  CFP  so  both  the  route  of  flight  and  fuel  planning information can be recorded.  Use the fuel planning blocks on the top of the flight plan and Table  12.1  for  fuel  planning.    En  route  and  Minimum  Landing  Fuel  will  be  automatically printed.    Pilots/CSO  will  ensure  an  accurate  Recovery  Fuel  is  input  on  the  CFPS Premission/Configuration/Fuel screen so calculated Continuation Fuels used during in-flight fuel monitoring are valid.  When alternates are required, pilots may need to accomplish and print two iterations of the flight plan to incorporate an accurate Recovery Fuel.  For example:  after the first calculation, pilots will extract the en route fuel to the alternate from the last line of  the  flight  plan  and  add  this  to  the  initial  Recovery  Fuel.    A  second  flight  plan  will  be calculated  once  the  Premission/Configuration/Fuel  screen  is  updated  with  the  correct Recovery  Fuel.    If  an  alternate  is  required,  use  the  Turnpoint/Additional  Points  screen  to insert the designated airfield as a DVT (divert) type after the intended landing airfield.  See Figure  14.2  for  a  sample  of  a  completed  CFPS  CFP  and  Figure  14.3  for  a  sample  of  a completed fuel planning worksheet.  (T-2) 12.4.1.1.  If  AARs  are  required,  multiple  iterations  of  the  flight  plan  will  need  to  be printed.    A  singular  flight  plan  for  every  segment  of  the  flight  (i.e.  “T/O  to  EAR  #1  to DVT”,  “ARIP  #1  to  EAR  #1  to  Dest”)  will  be  needed.    In  order  to  get  accurate Continuation Fuel on the CFP, use the following example.  (T-2) 12.4.1.1.1.  The  initial  segment  flight  plan  will  include  all  waypoints  from  takeoff through the Air-to-Air Refueling Exit Point (AREP), then routing to the A/R #1 Abort Base.  (T-2) 12.4.1.1.1.1.  Do not include any tanker onloads on this flight plan. 12.4.1.1.2.  Create a second flight plan starting with the Air-To-Air Refueling Initial Point (ARIP).  This flight plan will include all waypoints from the ARIP through the destination.  (T-2) 12.4.1.1.2.1.  Include a tanker onload at the AREP. 12.4.1.1.3.  Perform similar iterations if more than one AAR is required. 12.4.2.  C-130J Mission Computer Profile.  The C-130J Mission Computer plans a complete climb, cruise, descent, approach, and landing profile based on the inserted LEGS DATA and PERF  CLIMB,  CRUISE,  and  DESCENT  factors.    Accurate  leg  fuels,  as  calculated  by  the MC,  are  dependent  on  pilots  ensuring  that  airspeed,  altitude,  winds,  temperature,  and  fuel flow  are  correctly  represented  for  each  leg  of  the  route  and  updated/corrected  as  in-flight conditions  change.   Because the flight  profile is  more than a planning tool,  pilots  must use good  judgment  when  inputting  forecast/planned  information  versus  actual  performance  and conditions.  During preflight and at each waypoint, the Fuel On Board (FOB) for remaining legs  will  be  compared  against  the  flight  planned  Continuation  Fuel  to  ensure  there  is sufficient fuel to continue the mission as planned in order to meet or exceed destination fuel requirements.  Once airborne, the FOB on the PERF INIT WEIGHT page is calculated (not AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   137  sensed) using sensed Fuel Flow versus Time.  Update the FOB on the PERF INIT WEIGHT page to the amount indicated by the totalizer only when the totalizer amount is less than the calculated FOB.  Use the most conservative of the FOB or totalizer readings when recording fuel remaining during in-flight fuel monitoring.  The CNI will provide a FUEL QTY ERROR advisory  when  the  PERF  INIT  WEIGHT  FOB  and  totalizer  readings  differ  by  more  than 2,500 lbs for more than 10 minutes. Reserve Fuel (FIXED on PERF INIT WEIGHT) should be set to the Recovery Fuel value.  The CNI supplies a Low Calculated Fuel advisory when the calculated EXTRA fuel on the PERF INIT WEIGHT page falls below zero.  Destination and Alternate Landing Fuel can be obtained from the MC.  Flight crews will use the MC to evaluate  and  verify  destination  landing  fuel  status  after  mission  changes  and  reroutes  and whenever a divert is required and/or extensive weather avoidance routing is required.  (T-2) 12.5.  Fuel Planning Procedures.  Aircrew and mission planners will manage aviation fuel as a limited commodity and  precious  resource.  Fuel  optimization will be considered throughout  all phases  of  mission  planning  and  execution.    Excessive  ramp  and  recovery  fuel  adds  to  aircraft gross  weight  and  increases  fuel  consumption.    Do  not  ferry  extra  fuel  beyond  optimum requirements  for  safe  mission  accomplishment  and  training  objectives.    Aircrew  and  mission planners  will  optimize  flight  plans  and  flight  routing  for  fuel  efficiency.    In-flight  procedures such  as  climb/descent  profiles  and  power  settings  should  also  be  considered  for  efficient  fuel usage.    Aircrew  should  employ  the  following  aviation  fuel  optimization  measures  without compromising flight safety or jeopardizing mission/training accomplishment: (T-2) 12.5.1.  Plan  a  45-minute  fuel  reserve  at  destination  or  alternate  (when  an  alternate  is required). 12.5.2.  For remote destinations, holding is authorized in lieu of an alternate airport.  In such situations, use 2+00 hrs reserve fuel (1+15 holding in lieu of an alternate and 0+45 reserve). 12.5.3.  For  all  missions,  calculate  an  additional  30  minutes  of  contingency  fuel.  Contingency fuel should not be considered reserve fuel since crews may burn some or all of their  contingency  fuel.    Contingency  fuel  will  be  included  in  the  initial  required  ramp  fuel load (RRFL).  (T-2) 12.5.3.1.  Reserve  and  contingency  fuel  will  be  computed  using  consumption  rates providing  maximum  endurance  at  10,000  feet  MSL.    When  computing  reserve  and contingency  fuel  for  remote  destinations,  use  consumption  rates  providing  maximum endurance at 20,000 feet MSL.  (T-2) 12.5.4.  Calculate CAT 1 fuel reserve as 10% of flight time fuel over the CAT 1 route/route segment, not to exceed 1+00 fuel at normal cruise. 12.5.5.  Thunderstorm forecasts will be based on the DD Form 175-1 or equivalent.  Where weather forecast conditions dictate, add the following fuel corrections: (T-2) 12.5.5.1.  1,000 lbs if the route of flight has known or forecast icing conditions. 12.5.5.2.  1,500 lbs if forecast thunderstorms are scattered or numerous along the route of flight. 12.5.6.  Minimum  landing  fuel  is  3,000  lbs.  This  fuel  accounts  for  gauge  errors.    Do  not include this 3,000 lbs  of fuel  in  the 45-minute fuel  reserve and 30 minute contingency fuel calculations.   138  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 12.5.7.  Routes  will  be  planned  at  320  KTAS  (260  KTAS  below  10,000  MSL),  except  for oceanic crossings.  For oceanic crossings, routes will be planned at 300 KTAS or 290 KTAS, optimized for gross weight.  (T-2) 12.5.8.  Using  all  available  planning  tools  (including  ACFP)  and  guidance  in  this  chapter, PICs will determine the RRFL.  When actual fuel load exceeds the RRFL by more than 2,200 lbs, defuel the aircraft to the RRFL.  (T-2) 12.5.9.  Wing Relieving Fuel.  Calculate Wing Relieving Fuel using the flight manual weight limitations chart for the aircraft’s planned cargo load.  Enter the chart with the aircraft empty weight  and  cargo  weight,  then  read  across  to  determine  the  fuel  required  to  remain  within limits.  Add enough Wing Relieving Fuel, if required, to ensure that Recovery Fuel does not fall below the fuel required to remain within limits. 12.5.9.1.  All  missions  flying  low-level  should  initially  takeoff  with  main  tanks  full  to reduce  the  effects  of  wing  upbending  and  increase  the  center  wingbox  service  life.  Decreased takeoff fuel in the main tanks can decrease the center wingbox service life as much as 47%. 12.5.10.  Optimize fuel loads.  Mission plan for the required ramp and recovery fuel.  Ensure ramp fuel is correct upon arrival at aircraft. 12.5.11.  Minimize use of APUs.  Use ground power units when practical. 12.5.12.  Delay engine start time. 12.5.13.  Minimize aircraft weight through optimized fuel loads and reduction of equipment not necessary to accomplish the mission. 12.6.  Depressurization Fuel.  During all flight portions crews are to consider the possibility of exercising depressurization procedures. 12.6.1.  Crews  are  to  calculate  the  fuel  required  to  reach  a  recovery  airfield  in  the  event  of depressurization at the ETP.  Plan to arrive at the recovery airfield with 0+30 minutes reserve fuel  at  optimal  cruise  speed  for  the  depressurization  transit  altitude.    Transit  should  be planned at 10,000 feet MSL.  Plan on burning all other fuel. 12.6.2.  Prior  to  flight,  crews  must  compare  the  calculated  depressurization  fuel  with  the RRFL to determine if additional fuel is required.  (T-2) 12.7.  In-Flight  Fuel  Management.  For  a  flight  plan  and  corresponding  fuel  log  to  be  most meaningful for in-flight fuel monitoring, the actual cruise altitude should be no lower than 2,000 feet  below  planned  altitude  and  the  airspeed  no  lower  than  planned  airspeed  –  10  KTAS  or higher  than  planned  airspeed  +  10  KTAS.    If  initial  cruise  conditions  do  not  fall  within  these parameters, the PIC should strive to reach (or beat) them as soon as possible. 12.7.1.  Fuel  consumption  will  be  monitored  by  comparing  the  FOB  to  predicted  Fuel Remaining  and  the  required  Continuation  Fuel  on  the  flight  plan.    At  a  minimum, consumption  comparisons  will  be  accomplished  and  recorded  on  the  Master  Flight  Plan (MFP): (T-2) 12.7.1.1.  As soon as practical after initial level off. 12.7.1.2.  At convenient waypoint intervals not to exceed 1 hour. AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   139  12.7.1.3.  At  convenient  waypoint  intervals  not  to  exceed  30  minutes  if  aircraft performance  is  critical  or  marginal  (actual  fuel  is  less  than  Continuation  Fuel,  icing conditions, weather avoidance, etc.). 12.7.1.4.  Any time rerouting occurs or a lower  altitude than what  was flight  planned is required to be flown. 12.7.2.  If  AAR  onload  is  required,  update  required  fuel  onload  as  follows  at  the  ARIP  on “ARIP  #1  to  EAR  #1  to  Dest”  or  “ARIP  #2  to  EAR  #2  to  Dest”  flight  plan:      ACTUAL FUEL – CONT FUEL = Required Onload. 12.7.3.  The  fuel  recording  portion  of  the  master  flight  plan  may  be  discontinued  at  the discretion of the PIC when ALL of the following conditions have been met: 12.7.3.1.  The Equal Time Point (ETP) has been crossed (CAT I routes). 12.7.3.2.  Fuel systems and quantity indicators are functioning normally. 12.7.3.3.  There is obvious extra fuel and the +EXCESS fuel trend is favorable. 12.7.3.4.  All AARs have been completed. 12.7.4.  On  CAT  I  routes,  prior  to  the  ETP,  if  the  EXCESS  fuel  becomes  negative  the  PIC will consider and accomplish one of the following recommended actions: (T-2) 12.7.4.1.  Change the flight profile to ensure planned performance is reacquired and Fuel Reserves at destination will be met or exceeded.  (T-2) 12.7.4.2.  Continue and land short of the intended destination (i.e., First Suitable Airfield (FSAF)) or proceed to intended destination based on an updated weather forecast that no longer requires an alternate. 12.7.4.3.  Return to the departure base or the Last Suitable Airfield (LSAF). 12.7.5.  Flight  Plan  Changes  and  Diversion.    When  mission  requirements  or  ATC  dictate  a change  to  the  planned  mission  or  route,  the  fuel  must  be  recalculated  to  ensure  safe completion of the flight.  It is not practical to complete a new flight plan fuel log so the MC is the primary method of deciding if a mission change or reroute can be accommodated.  (T-2) 12.7.5.1.  For  an  unplanned  or  directed  en  route  divert,  the  FROM/TO  page,  with  an associated  cruise  ground  speed,  can  be  used  to  determine  an  Estimated  Time  En  route (ETE).    Using  a  4,500  lbs/hr  or  LRC  speed  from  OPTIMAL  CRZ  1/2  fuel  burn,  crews should  be  able  to  decide  if  the  new  routing  is  achievable  without  adverse  effects  on destination fuel.  Do not accept a reroute that adversely depletes the destination Reserve Fuel as prescribed in this chapter. 12.7.5.2.  If  the  en  route  change  does  not  affect  the  intended  destination,  then  in-flight fuel monitoring will consist of comparing the MC predicted Remaining Fuel with Flight Plan  Continuation  Fuel  at  the  next  point  common  to  the  reroute  and  the  original  flight plan.  After any route alteration, crews should actively monitor fuel state by recording the Fuel  Remaining  values  at  abeam  positions  of  the  original  flight  plan  and  using  the “Abeam” function of the INDEX/FIX INFO PAGE to cross-check fuel status.  (T-2)   140  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 12.7.6.  Declare “Emergency Fuel” when it is determined that the aircraft will land with less than 4,000 lbs.  Declare ”Minimum Fuel” to ATC when it is determined that the aircraft will land with less than 4,000 lbs plus the Required Reserve.  (T-2) Table 12.1.  Fuel Load Components  (T-2). FUEL PLANNING EN ROUTE STTO CLIMB CRUISE APPR CAT I RESERVE ALTERNATE Fuel required from engine start through landing at the intended destination.  Components include engine start/taxi/takeoff (STTO), climb, cruise, approach fuel.  En route fuel will be obtained from the CFPS CFP, or Performance Manual. A component of en route fuel.  Fuel required for engine start, taxi, and takeoff. Normally 800 lbs.  For known taxi delays or additional engine running ground time in excess of 30 minutes, add 30 lbs/min. A component of en route fuel.  Fuel required from takeoff through climb to initial cruise altitude.  If a manual calculation is required, the applicable Performance Manual’s Fuel to Climb charts will be used.  Unless required for mission accomplishment, plan to climb no higher than ATC cruise ceiling per the Performance Manual. A component of en route fuel.  Fuel required from TOC to overhead intended destination.  If a manual calculation is required, the applicable Performance Manuals’ charts will be used. A component of en route fuel.  Fuel required for approach, and landing from overhead destination.  Normally 700 lbs, which accounts for one instrument approach of no longer than 10 minutes.  For longer approaches, follow-on visual, and/or radar pattern work, compute fuel burn at 85 lbs/min. Fuel for 10% of en route time along a CAT I route/segment computed at cruise fuel flow, not to exceed 1 hour of flight time. Fuel required from intended destination to alternate, or most distant alternate when two are required.  Flown at optimum cruise altitude, using direct routing to the alternate at LRC airspeed.  Fuel for a missed approach (2000 lbs) and second approach at the alternate airfield is required when the visibility-only weather criteria is used to determine the suitability of the original destination. REQUIRED RESERVE  45 minute reserve, using maximum endurance airspeed at 10,000 feet MSL (20,000 feet remote fields.).  Required overhead destination or alternate (if alternate is needed.) CONTINGENCY FUEL 15 minutes, using max endurance airspeed at 10,000 feet MSL DEPRESSURIZATION FUEL (20,000 feet MSL for remote fields.) Fuel from the ETP to a recovery airfield, with 30 minute reserve.  Calculated at LRC airspeed and 10,000 feet MSL.  Plan on burning all other fuel.  Compare with RRFL to see if additional fuel is required before flight. AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   141  FUEL PLANNING MINIMUM LANDING FUEL RECOVERY FUEL CONTINUATION FUEL TANKERED FUEL UNIDENTIFIED EXTRA WING RELIEVING FUEL WEATHER AVOIDANCE ICING KNOWN HOLDING DELAYS 3,000 lbs (Required.) If it is determined that the aircraft will land with less than this amount, a fuel emergency exists and ATC must be informed.  This entry is separate from required reserve and contingency fuel. The minimum planned landing fuel at intended destination.  This is the sum of the Minimum Landing Fuel, Required Reserve, Wing Relieving Fuel (if required) and Alternate Fuel (if required).  This fuel is critical to calculating accurate Continuation Fuels for each leg; it must be updated in the Premission Configuration screen of PFPS if using a CFPS CFP. Fuel required at the beginning of each leg to be able to proceed to the intended destination and land with the required Recovery Fuel. Fuel for succeeding legs without refueling. The difference between RRFL and actual ramp fuel.  This figure should include all offload fuel (HAAR, FARP/RGR, etc.) Additional fuel kept in the main tanks intended to counter wing bending moments and keep the aircraft within flight manual weight limitations. 1,500 lbs if forecast thunderstorms are scattered or numerous along the route of flight. 1,000 lbs if the route of flight has known or forecast icing conditions. Fuel for anticipated/planned holding, including remote destinations.  Compute at Four-Engine Maximum Endurance Fuel Flow.   142  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 Figure 12.1.

The  loadmaster  (LM)  coordinates  loading  or  offloading  with  air  terminal operations  or  shipping  agencies;  plans  loads;  supervises  loading,  tie-down,  and  offloading operations;  performs  preflight  and  postflight  of  aircraft  and  systems;  computes  aircraft  weight and  balance;  provides  for  the  safety  and  comfort  of  passengers/troops  and  security  of  cargo during  flight;  prepares  and  rigs  equipment  for  airdrop;  participates  in  the  aerial  delivery  of equipment,  supplies,  and  personnel.    In  addition  to  the  duties  listed  in  the  flight  manual,  other applicable  technical  orders,  tactical  manuals,  and  this  instruction,  the  PIC  may  assign  other mission-related duties as necessary. 13.2.  Aircraft Loading Responsibilities. 13.2.1.  The  LM  is  responsible  for  aircraft  preflight,  load  planning,  certifying  load  plans, operating  aircraft  equipment,  supervising  and  directing  loading  and  offloading  operations, and cargo tie-down.  He or she is also responsible for entering weight and balance data into the      CNI-MU  Weight  and  Balance  pages.    The  LM  coordinates  with  the  loading  crew supervisor to verify cargo against manifests, supervises loading operations, and is responsible for  the  safe  movement  of  cargo  into  and  out  of  the  aircraft.    The  LM  will  notify  the  PIC, command  post,  or  the  terminal  operations  officer  if  loading  personnel  are  injured  or  cargo, aircraft  equipment,  or  aircraft  structure  is  damaged  during  loading  or  offloading.    The  LM will brief the PIC on any hazardous cargo and cargo jettison ability prior to engine start.  (T-2) 13.2.2.  Loads  planned  by  qualified  load  planners  will  be  accepted  by  the  aircraft  LM  and loaded  aboard  the  aircraft  as  planned,  unless  the  load  or  any  portion  of  it  will  compromise flight  safety  or  does  not  comply  with  applicable  aircraft  technical  orders  or  USAF publications.  The aircraft LM may also deviate from load plans to facilitate ease of onload or offload of cargo and to alleviate unnecessary aircraft reconfiguration.  (T-2) 13.2.3.  The  LM  is  the  on-scene  expert  for  load  planning  and  accepting  cargo  for  airlift.  Some  loads  are  not  specifically  detailed  in  applicable  directives  and  require  the  LM  to  use their best judgment, based on training, experience, and knowledge, to determine the best and safest method of loading the cargo.  When difficulties arise, they should seek advice of other personnel  (i.e.,  available  LMs  and  squadron,  group,  wing,  or  AFSOC  standardization personnel.) 13.2.4.  At  locations  without  air  terminal  or  traffic  personnel,  the  shipper  assumes  the responsibility  for  ensuring  cargo  is  properly  weighed,  marked  and  is  accompanied  by  the correct documentation. 13.2.5.  During Joint Airborne Air Transportability Training (JA/ATT), Special Assignment Airlift  Mission  (SAAM),  USAF  mobility,  and  contingency  missions,  the  LM  can  accept DD Form 2133, Joint Airlift Inspection Record, as a valid pre-inspection of equipment being offered for air  shipment.  This form, validated by two joint inspection signatures (user and transporting  force),  may  be  used  in  lieu  of  the  applicable  portions  of  the  TO  1C-130(H)J-  146  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 9CL-1.  The DD Form 2133 will not be used to document preparation of hazardous materials.  This will be accomplished using the Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous Goods.  (T-2) 13.2.6.  Participates  in  the  aerial  delivery  of  equipment,  supplies,  and  personnel,  to  include manually assisting the exit of door bundles (i.e., CRL, RAMZ, Bike Bundles, etc.), from the ramp  and  door/paratroop  door(s).    Additionally  the  loadmaster,  when  required,  will participate  in  the  loading,  tie-down,  and  offloading  of  cargo/equipment  as  mission  dictates.  (T-2) 13.2.7.  The loadmaster shall be thoroughly familiar with the normal and emergency airplane capabilities,  associated  airplane  systems,  all  aerial  delivery  systems,  and  shall  be  able  to accomplish airplane emergency procedures. 13.3.  Emergency  Exits  and  Safety  Aisles.  Safety  aisles  will  be  maintained IAW AFI 112MC130J,  Vol  3,  Addenda  A,  MC-130J  Configuration/Mission  Planning  and  this chapter.  (T-2) 13.3.1.  At  least  one  unobstructed  emergency  exit  will  be  available  for  each  20 passengers/troops.    (This  does  not  restrict  overwater  flights  if  the  three  overhead  escape hatches are available for egress.)  Litters and seats erected across an emergency exit are not considered an obstruction.  (T-2) 13.3.2.  Passengers/ambulatory  patients  may  not  be  seated  closer  than  30  inches  in  front  of palletized  netted  cargo  or  cargo  secured  with  straps.    When  the  cargo,  either  palletized  or non-  palletized,  is  secured  with  chains,  the  30-inch  spacing  is  not  required.        Exception:  Maintain 30 inch spacing on AE missions, when carrying occupied litters. 13.4.  Flight  Monitoring.  The  loadmaster  will  monitor  all  applicable  aircraft  systems.    Notify the PIC of all abnormal indications and take appropriate action.  (T-2) 13.5.  Weight  and  Balance.

Channel Cargo and Passenger Missions. 13.8.1.  Channel  Cargo.   AFSOC aircraft do not  routinely  airlift  channel  cargo;  however, if so  tasked,  contact  the  Air  Terminal  Operations  Center  (ATOC),  Airlift  Control  Element (ALCE),  or  air  freight/passenger  service  to  obtain  the  cargo  and  passenger  breakdown  and assist  in  planning  of  proposed  load.   If  required,  security  requirements  for  the cargo/passengers  being  carried  will  be  briefed  to  the  loadmaster  during  the  initial  load briefing at ATOC.  At stations where aircraft tie-down equipment is exchanged, make every effort  to  ensure  that  a  one-for-one  exchange  occurs.    If  this  is  not  possible,  the  loadmaster will inform the PIC of lost or missing equipment and annotate missing items on the aircraft Dash 21 Equipment Inventory, refer to AFTO  Form 781.  (T-2) 13.8.2.  Passenger Missions.   148  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 13.8.2.1.  AFSOC aircraft will not normally be tasked to support Air Mobility Command passenger missions, nor will passengers be manifested or loaded aboard AFSOC aircraft without the prior approval of the PIC/mission commander.  (T-2) 13.8.2.2.  Prior  to  releasing  seats,  ensure  terminal  operations  passenger  handling personnel are aware that passenger comfort latrine facilities are extremely limited, and of the possibility of an in-flight diversion. 13.9.  Passenger  Handling.  The  loadmaster  is  the  key  figure  concerning  good  passenger relations.    Be  aware  of  the  doubts  and  fears  that  may  arise  in  the  minds  for  passengers  and anticipate their questions and actions. 13.9.1.  Passengers  may  move  about  the  cargo  compartment.    Good  judgment  must  be exercised  on  the  number  of  passengers  allowed  out  of  their  seats  at  one  time.    Encourage passengers to keep seat belts fastened when seated.  (T-2) 13.9.2.  Do not allow passengers to lounge on or tamper with equipment, cargo, or baggage. Ensure passengers are not allowed access to checked baggage. 13.9.3.  Ensure  that  classified  equipment  remains  covered  during  the  entire  mission  when passengers are onboard and ensure passengers are denied access to this equipment. 13.10.  Troop  Movements.  Most  personnel  carried  aboard  AFSOC  aircraft  are  aboard  to perform a specific mission.  Every effort should be made to advise them of mission progress and deviations.  The troop commander will be identified prior to boarding.  (T-2) 13.10.1.  Determine if the troop commander has any special requirements prior to departure, and advise the PIC of these requirements, if appropriate. 13.10.2.  Determine  if  specific  communications  requirements  exist  and  coordinate  these requirements with the PIC. 13.10.3.  Determine if there is a need for the troops to perform any type of in-flight rigging. Ensure  the  aircraft  is  loaded  to  accommodate  in-flight  rigging  if  required.    Inform  the  PIC prior to in-flight rigging.  If turbulence is anticipated, the PIC should inform the loadmaster as much in advance as possible. 13.10.4.  Ensure  that  troops  do  not  have  access  to  aircraft  classified  equipment  during  the mission.    If  troops  require  access  to  classified  equipment,  the  requirement  should  be  made known to the PIC prior to the mission. 13.10.5.  Passenger  Combat  Loading.    Floor  loading  is  authorized  to  support  dedicated unconventional  forces  and  foreign  counterparts  during  operations,  exercises,  and  training.  Standard  seating  configurations  listed  in  applicable  addenda  should  be  used,  if  practical.      Exception:    Group  commander  (COMAFSOF  for  contingency  operations)  may  authorize Rapid  Infil/Exfil  procedures  and  floor  loading  with  non-SOF  personnel.            Note:    This procedure  will  not  be  used  in  lieu  of  providing  normal  seating  when  available.    (T-2)      WARNING:  During passenger combat loading, the loadmaster will ensure all occupants are provided restraint IAW AFTTP 3-3.MC-130J.

This  volume  establishes  procedures  for  AFSOC  Direct  Support  Operators (DSO)  for  employment  of  MC-130J  aircraft.    In  addition  to  the  duties  listed  in  applicable technical  orders,  directives,  and  this  instruction,  the  PIC  may  assign  other  duties  as  necessary.  The DSO is primarily responsible for providing inputs to enhance aircrew situational awareness. 16.2.  Mission Planning Factors. 16.2.1.  Mission  Planning.    Detailed  information  on  mission  planning  can  be  found  in AFTTP 31.General  Planning(S),  General  Planning  and  Employment  Considerations, AFTTP 31.Threat Guide, Threat Reference Guide and Considerations, AFTTP 3-1.MC-130J, Tactical Employment MC-130J, and AFTTP 3-3.MC-130, Combat Aircraft Fundamentals. 16.2.2.  The  DSO,  after  coordinating  with  the  supporting  analyst  and  other  appropriate agencies,  will  conduct  mission  planning  with  the  aircrew  of  all  combat  mission  scenarios.  The DSO will brief expected scenario inputs based on the analytical data, as required.  (T-2) 16.2.3.  The  DSO  is  responsible  for  coordinating  with  all  appropriate  agencies  to  obtain  all required or anticipated mission planning, professional, and SILENT SHIELD equipment for the duration of the flight/deployment.  The DSO will ensure all equipment is inventoried and inspected prior to flight/deployment.  (T-2) 16.3.  Preflight/In-Flight Responsibilities.  The DSO will: (T-2) 16.3.1.  Brief  the  crew  on  the  SILENT  SHIELD  equipment  configuration  and  anticipated inputs. 16.3.2.  Ensure the crew is aware of SILENT SHIELD capabilities and limitations, as well as operational security considerations. 16.3.3.  Monitor  situational  awareness  information  and  relay  pertinent  information  to  the crew. 16.3.4.  Advise the crew of any change in the status of mission equipment. 16.3.5.  The  DSO  is  responsible  for  knowing  approximate  aircraft  location,  altitude,  and intentions at all times. 16.3.6.  Be colocated with the SILENT SHIELD equipment. 16.4.  Communications  Procedures.  When  missions  require  the  DSO  to  communicate,  they will obtain proper frequencies, time hack, schedules, and call signs prior to flight.  Depending on the nature of the mission and the communications, the DSO will keep the crew updated on any pertinent information and will coordinate with the PIC for authorization to transmit.  On MC130J aircraft,  the  DSO  will  coordinate  with  the  crew  during  mission  planning  regarding  interphone connectivity.  (T-2) 16.5.  Post Mission.  In addition to appropriate debriefs, the DSO will also ensure: (T-2) 16.5.1.  Equipment write-ups are passed on to maintenance. AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   157  16.5.2.  Post mission Technical Summary inputs are provided to the supporting analyst. 16.5.3.  Provide information to their units summarizing mission events, as required. 16.6.  Augmentation.  Some contingency  operations may require operators from other units, or in  some cases, non-aircrew personnel  to  provide tactical cryptologic support.   In these cases, a mission-ready  instructor-qualified  DSO  will  fly  as  primary  DSO,  and  be  responsible  for  DSO inputs.  (T-2)   158  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 Chapter 17 TACTICAL EMPLOYMENT PROCEDURES 17.1.  General.  This chapter describes the specific equipment requirements, training restrictions, and  regulatory  guidance  for  employment  procedures  for  the  MC-130J.    It  is  not  a  stand-alone reference and should be used in conjunction with AFTTP 3-3 MC-130J and other publications.  In the case of any  conflict  between AFTTP  3-3 MC-130J (or equivalent), this instruction takes precedence. 17.2.  Crew Duties. 17.2.1.  Pilot Flying (PF) maintains contour altitude and ensures terrain clearance.  The PF is responsible for time control once time status is within one minute of the Time Over Target (TOT)/Time of Arrival (TOA). 17.2.2.  Pilot  Monitoring  is  responsible  for  backing  up  the  PF.    The  PM  runs  all  checklists once airborne unless delegated to another crew member.  The PM should be primary for all ATC  communications,  to  include  landing  zone  personnel,  and  provides  nonsecure communications  IAW  the  Command  Electronic  Order  of  Information  (CEOI).    The  PM monitors  aircraft  instruments;  and  cross-checks  aircraft  altitude  and  terrain  clearance  using NVGs, radar scope interpretation, and the radar altimeter.  The PM also assists the CSO with maintaining  proper  flight  path,  acquiring  controlling  terrain,  and  identifying  the  objective area. 17.2.3.  CSO  directs  the  crew  along  the  planned  route,  providing  terrain  and  climb/descent advisories to the pilots, briefing turn points and time advisories, and time control when time status is greater than one minute early/late.  They are responsible for maintaining the desired flight path via radar scope interpretation and all other situational awareness tools.  If use of the  radar  is  denied,  the  CSO  will  use  EO/IR,  NVGs,  and  other  passive  sensors  to  assist  in terrain  clearance.  The CSO programs and monitors the ECM gear and is primary for radio communication with C2, tactical control agencies (e.g., range and drop zone personnel), and other ground parties during mission events.  The CSO provides secure communications IAW the CEOI.  (T-2) 17.2.4.  Loadmaster.    Responsible  for  rear  quadrant  visual  threat  detection.    Ensures  that cargo  compartment  lights  (except  EL,  if  installed)  are  off  from  ingress  to  egress  in  hostile areas at night.  When in a threat environment, the ALE-47 portable flare fire buttons will be held.  (T-2) 17.2.5.  The following duties are divided between all crew positions:  CNI-MU programming and  updating,  time  control,  mission  planning,  monitoring  of  fuel  status  (fuel  should  be checked at least once every 60 minutes), and communications with C2.  The PIC will ensure all  navigation/communication  duties  are  clearly  understood  prior  to  flight.    This  includes assigning  responses  for  particular  equipment  in  the  tactical  checklists.    Emphasis  will  be placed on all dual use controls (CNI-MU, Radar, Fuel panel, Refuel Control panel, etc.).  (T-2) 17.2.6.  Heads Down Displays (HDD).  The standard HDD configuration for tactical flying is radar  on  1,  4,  and  (5  or  6)  with  the  full  channel  dedicated  to  Ground  Map  or  Monopulse AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   159  Ground  Mapping  (MGM)  mode.    The  crew  member  who  is  primary  for  navigation  will  be responsible  for  the  ranges  on  the  different  sensors  to  help  support  the  PF.    HDDs  2  and  3 should  be  set  to  Digi-Map  and  Terrain  Awareness  and  Warning  System  (TAWS), respectively.   At a minimum,  TAWS will have RWR overlay selected for threat situational awareness.  It is up to the PIC to determine any deviations from this standard configuration.  (T-2) 17.3.  Aircraft Preparation.  Non-essential equipment should be removed from the aircraft prior to combat missions. 17.4.  Survival and Protective Equipment.  All personnel will wear the survival and protective gear as directed by the mission commander, local directives, or SPINs.  (T-2) 17.5.  In-Flight  Use  of  Portable  Electronic  Devices.  EMI  Certified  devices  and  software  are allowed in-flight IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 3. 17.6.  Equipment  Requirements.  Table  17.1,  Tactical  Operations, the  minimum equipment  required  for  various  mission  events.    Aircrew  experience  level  and  the  mission scenario may dictate additional equipment requirements than those listed. lists Table 17.1.  Tactical Operations.

If aircraft do not possess the minimum equipment listed, they are restricted to flying MSA or to the wing position in a formation. 2.  Either Map or MGM mode must be operational. 3.    If  APN-241  is  inoperable,  crews  may  fly  NVG  LL  (VMC)  over  flat  and  rolling  (non-mountainous) terrain. 4.  Either the APN-241 or the EO/IR is required. 5.  EO/IR must be operable for threat penetration over land. 6.  Operable APN-241 not required with EGI FOM 2 or better. 7.    Minimum  of  1  x  EGI  navigation  solution  required  for  mission  computer-directed  airdrops (FOM 4 or greater requires an update). 8.  Visual airdrops require 1 x operable INU. 17.7.  Mission Planning.  All pilots and CSOs will conduct a route study prior to any low-level operations.  The route study will emphasize NVG limitations and performance factors and their impact on terrain and obstacle clearance.  (T-2) 17.7.1.  A daylight route survey will be conducted for all unpublished training routes prior to night/IMC  operations  below  500  feet  AGL.    Any  route  or  route  segment  not  surveyed  or routinely flown within the last 12 months will be considered unsurveyed.  (T-2) 17.7.2.  En  route  Planning.    Crews  should  fly  tactical  missions  at  the  highest  altitude commensurate with the threat environment(s).  During training, FLIP, ICAO procedures, or training considerations may dictate greater weather or altitude minimums. 17.7.3.  Mountainous terrain is defined as a 500 foot or greater terrain differential in 1/2 nm or less. 17.7.4.  Threat analysis.  Refer to AFTTP 3-1.General Planning, and 3-1.Threat Guide for in-depth information of threat system capabilities and limitations, as well as threat employment techniques. 17.7.5.  Mission  employment.    Refer  to  AFTTP  3-1/3.MC-130  for  detailed  information  on MC130 tactical techniques and procedures until a AFTTP 3-1/3 MC-130J is released. 17.7.6.  Chart  requirements.    Planned  routes  will  be  drawn  on  a  1:500,000  (TPC)  or  larger scale  chart.    Use  a  1:250,000  (JOG)  or  larger  scale  chart  for  overland  threat  penetration operations,  mountainous  NVG  low-level  operations,  and  the  objective  area,  unless  not available  or  of  an  inferior  quality  to  a  TPC.    If  a  TPC  is  used  for  planning,  adjust  MSA altitudes to account for the larger contour interval unless terrain elevation can be positively verified by other means.  Every effort must be made to minimize chart clutter.  If electronic charts  are  used,  a  backup  paper  chart,  prepared  IAW  chart  requirements,  must  be immediately available for each crew member using electronic charts.  (T-2)     WARNING:  Aeronautical charts do not depict man-made obstacles less than 200 feet AGL or a change in terrain until it exceeds the chart contour interval.  The worst situation would occur if a 199-foot  tower  sat  on  terrain  with  an  elevation  just  below  the  next  higher  contour.    For  a AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   161  1:500,000  (TPC)  with  a  contour  interval  of  500  feet,  this  results  in  an  uncharted  obstacle existing 698 feet above charted terrain.  Additionally, the highest spot elevation on any given leg may not be the highest terrain as in the case of gradually rising elevations.    Note:  If a NVG route (any terrain condition) has been planned using a JOG and elevations and altitudes are verified, the route may be flown with reference to a TPC. 17.7.6.1.  Color  copies  and  laminated  charts  are  acceptable  provided  the  contour  and contrast  remain  intact  and  the  chart  is  used  for  preflight  route  study  and  the  flight.    If laminated  charts  are  used,  the  crew  will  ensure  that  the  laminate  does  not  degrade  the quality or readability of the chart and that all data remains intact.  (T-2) 17.7.6.1.1.  Minimize chart clutter.  NVG altitudes will be annotated on charts when NVG low-level is planned.  Start climb points and the controlling terrain location will be  annotated  on  charts  if  required  due  to  mission  factors  such  as  terrain  elevation changes, hidden terrain, reduced visibility or low lunar illumination.  (T-2) 17.7.6.1.2.  NVG  Altitudes.    NVG  altitudes  are  an  altitude  designed  to  provide  a degree  of  terrain  masking  and  clearance  along  the  planned  flight  path.    Base  NVG altitudes  on  terrain  elevation  0.5  nm  either  side  of  flight  planned  route,  adding  the planned en route AGL altitude. 17.7.6.1.3.  Start  climb  points  are  determined  to  identify  where  along  the  planned route of flight a climb must be initiated to maintain a specific NVG altitude profile in mountainous  terrain.    These  points  are  determined  by  working  backwards  from  the NVG altitude along the planned route of flight using a preplanned climb gradient.  (T-2) 17.7.6.2.  The chart series, scale, and edition will be annotated on the chart.  The current Chart Updating Manual (CHUM) review date will also be annotated on the chart.  (T-2) 17.7.6.3.  Place the ESA in bold numbers on the chart.  When multiple ESAs are used, or when  strip  charts  are  used,  the  ESA  will  be  annotated  on  each  chart  segment.    Place  a double box around the obstacle or terrain that defines each ESA.  (T-2) 17.7.6.4.  For each leg, place a box around the obstacle or terrain that defines the MSA.  MSA, magnetic course, and leg distance will be annotated on the chart for each leg. 17.7.6.5.  Operational Advisory Arrows are optional on pilot charts. 17.7.6.6.  When transitioning from one chart to another, allow a sufficient route overlap. 17.7.6.7.  The pilot  and  copilot  may  share a single low-level chart during flight.    If this option  is  used,  both  the  pilot  and  copilot  must  participate  in  pre-mission  route  analysis using the single chart.  (T-2) 17.7.6.8.  Order  of  Battle.    In  an  exercise  or  actual  combat  situation,  it  is  required  to depict  threat  information  directly  on  the  navigational  route  chart.    Inclusion  of  threat capabilities may classify the chart.       Note:  Classify charts depending on information sources  and  methods  used  to  obtain  this  data  (required  only  if  classification  is Confidential or higher). 17.8.  Preparation for NVG Operations.   162  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 17.8.1.  General.  Aircraft are normally configured for NVG operations prior to departure.  In addition  to  the  normal  aircraft  preflight,  crew  members  have  specific  tasks  to  prepare  the aircraft for NVG landing missions.  Additional equipment is necessary to prepare the aircraft and  crew  members  for  missions  that  require  NVG  operations.    The  recommended  aircraft equipment requirements and aircrew responsibilities are listed in this section. 17.8.2.  Aircraft Equipment Kit. 17.8.2.1.  Aircraft blackout and eyebrow curtains. 17.8.2.2.  Porthole covers for the cargo compartment. 17.8.2.3.  Chem lights for use in marking emergency exit handles. 17.8.3.  Aircrew Equipment Kit. 17.8.3.1.  NVGs.    Mission  requirements  and  duration  of  the  deployment  will  be determining  factors  for  the  total  number  of  NVG  sets  required.    The  PIC  must  ensure there is one spare set of preflighted NVGs for the flight deck crew members.  When the mission requires the loadmasters to use NVGs, a spare set will be available for their use as well.  All crew members will perform a thorough preflight of their NVGs.  (T-2) 17.8.3.2.  Helmets with mounts for NVGs. 17.8.3.3.  IR filtered flashlights, finger lights, lip lights, or chem lights, if required. 17.8.4.  Ensure  both  interior  and  exterior  lights  are  correctly  set  and  are  as  dim  as  possible commensurate with safety and visibility. 17.9.  Low-Level Operations. 17.9.1.  AFTTP 3-3 MC-130J augments procedures in this instruction.      WARNING:  The CSO or PM must continually keep the PF apprised of flight progress and anticipated terrain elevations, obstructions, climb points, and descent points.  (T-2) 17.9.2.  Emergency Safe Altitude (ESA).  ESA is an altitude that will provide positive terrain clearance during situations that require the exiting of the low-level environment.  To compute ESA,  add  1,000  feet  (2,000  feet  in  mountainous  terrain)  to  the  highest  obstacle  or  terrain feature  within  10  nm  of  route  centerline  or  intended  flight  path  (whichever  is  greater), rounded  to  the  next  100  foot  increment.    Use  of  area  ESAs  is  recommended  whenever possible;  however,  a  single  ESA  is  sufficient  when  there  are  no  significant  changes  in topography.  ESA will be annotated on all flight charts.  (T-2) 17.9.3.  Minimum  Safe  Altitude.    MSA  provides  terrain  clearance  and  limited  threat avoidance during situations that require the interruption of low-level operations.  To compute MSA  for  each  leg  or  leg  segment,  add  500  feet  to  the  elevation  of  the  highest  terrain  or obstacle within 3 nm of route centerline or the planned flight path (whichever is greater), and round up to the next 100- foot increment. 17.9.4.  Low-Level Weather Requirements.   In  accordance with  AFI11-202, Vol 3.  During training  operations,  FLIP,  ICAO  procedures,  or  training  considerations  may  dictate  higher weather  minimums.    Higher  minimum  visibility  may  be  required  to  identify  and  clear obstacles.    Note:    Lack  of  sufficient  illumination  may  prevent  NVG  contour  operations  in otherwise VMC conditions. AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   163  17.9.5.  Missions planned when the lunar illumination is forecast to be less than 0.8 millilux or  10%  effective  illumination  during  the  mission  require  an  additional  level  of  ORM.    The squadron CC/DO will be made aware of the ORM assessment and risk mitigation conducted for missions planned to be flown in low illumination conditions.  (T-2) 17.9.6.  Low-Level Altitudes. 17.9.6.1.  Day VMC Low-Level Altitude.  300 foot AGL contour. 17.9.6.2.  NVG  Low-Level  Altitudes.  The minimum  en route altitude is  300 feet  AGL.  Squadron commanders may restrict crews to 500 feet AGL in mountainous terrain.  The minimum  in-flight  visibility  is  3  sm.    Higher  minimum  visibility  may  be  required  to identify and clear obstacles.   Exception:  During terminal area operations (airdrops and approaches),  do  not  descend  from  en  route  altitude  until  the  objective  is  identified  and adequate terrain clearance is assured.  Higher altitudes should be flown if terrain-masked. 17.9.6.3.  Night  VMC  (Non-NVG).    Minimum  altitude  is  MSA.    When  the  altitude  for the  next  leg  or  segment  is  higher  than  the  altitude  currently  being  flown,  complete  the climb prior to the turn point or segment.  When the altitude for the next leg or segment is lower than the current altitude, do not initiate descent until established on the new leg or segment.  Exception:  During terminal area operations (airdrops and approaches), do not descend  from  en  route  altitude  until  the  objective  is  identified  and  adequate  terrain clearance is  assured.  Conduct  night  VMC  (non-NVG) HAAR/TAAR operations with  a refueling altitude at MSA or higher. 17.9.6.4.  Crews  may  fly  low-level  in  IMC  at  MSA  altitudes.    During  training,  conduct planned IMC routes under instrument flight rules (IFR) on a published or surveyed route unless FLIP or host nation rules define other procedures. 17.9.6.5.  Threat  Penetration  (TP).    Must  be  pre-planned  and  is  restricted  to  flat/rolling (non-mountainous) terrain and coastal penetrations.  Limit the time at TP altitude to the duration needed to avoid/negate the threat.  Minimum TP altitude is 100 feet AGL.  (T-2) 17.9.7.  Climb to MSA when either pilot must leave the seat or loses NVGs during low-level flight.  Exception:  If performing a planned seat swap for training with an Instructor Pilot in the seat, climb to a safe altitude.  (T-2) 17.9.8.  Altimeter Settings.  Use the best available altimeter setting.  It is vital that aircrews accurately update all altimeters prior to low-level/objective area operations.  When a current local altimeter setting is not available, or a reliable altimeter update (ALT UPDATE) cannot be accomplished, use the lowest forecast altimeter setting. 17.9.8.1.  An  ALT  UPDATE  altimeter  setting  derived  in-flight  should  only  be  used outside ATC controlled environments.  An ALT UPDATE should be performed prior to all airdrops or landings.  Obtain an ALT UPDATE as close to the objective area and as near  the  objective  altitude  as  possible.    Use  sound  judgment  when  updating  aircraft altimeters and cross-check elevations and new settings with all available information. 17.9.8.1.1.  If a valid GPS position is available (FOM 2 or better), the PM will update the  aircraft  altimeter  setting  to  equal  the  GPS  altitude  once  established  on  drop altitude.  For tactical approaches, set altimeters to the reported surface QNH setting, if available.    If  surface  QNH  is  not  available,  conduct  an  altimeter  update  if  ingress   164  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 altitude  is  within  1,000  feet  of  field  elevation;  otherwise,  set  the  forecasted  lowest altimeter setting.  (T-2) 17.9.8.1.2.  If  a  valid  GPS  altitude  is  unavailable  (FOM  3  or  greater),  the  CSO  will update the pressure altimeter by recording the current altimeter setting, AGL altitude from  the  radar  altimeter,  and  the  MSL  altitude  from  the  pressure  altimeter  over  a known elevation and  computing a  new setting or use the minimum  altimeter setting for  the  objective  area.    This  works  well  when  flying  over  a  body  of  water,  or  flat terrain.  Ensure the radar altimeter is fully operational and use sound judgment when updating aircraft altimeters.  (T-2)     WARNING:  Obtaining an ALT UPDATE at a significantly higher or lower altitude than the target  can induce substantial  altimeter error.  Use extreme caution when updating the pressure altimeter to a higher setting, as lower absolute altitudes will result.  (T-2) 17.9.8.1.3.  Apply  cold  weather  altimeter  corrections  IAW  AFI  11-202,  Vol  3, AFSOC Supplement to all non-GPS derived barometric altitudes. 17.10.  Low-Level Emergency Procedures. 17.10.1.  Crew  Disorientation.    Threat  permitting,  start  a  climb  to  ESA    when  a  crew becomes disoriented on a low-level  mission.  Continue the climb  until  ESA is  reached or a positive  fix  is  obtained.    After  obtaining  a  positive  fix,  descend  and  resume  low-level operations.  The CSO/PM will cross-check timing and adjust as necessary.  (T-2) 17.10.2.  Spatial  Disorientation.    The  PM  will  be  ready  to  immediately  take  control  of  the aircraft if the flying pilot experiences spatial disorientation or a NVG malfunction.  In either event,  start  a  climb  to  at  least  MSA  until  the  pilot  experiencing  the  problem  is  ready  to assume PM duties.  (T-2) 17.10.3.  Inoperative NVGs.  During an NVG takeoff or landing, the PM must react quickly to  assume  control  and  execute  the  appropriate  action,  regardless  of  qualification  or  pilot position.    The  crew  must  be  ready  to  turn  on  overt  landing  and  taxi  lights  to  assist  in  the maneuver.  (T-2) 17.10.4.  Aircraft  System  Failure.    Begin  a  climb  to  MSA  when  a  known  or  suspected malfunction prevents continued safe low-level operations. 17.10.5.  Emergency Climb.  Consider this procedure in cases of (but not limited to):  certain equipment  malfunctions,  spatial  disorientation,  inadvertent  weather  penetration,  critically low  aircraft  altitude  and/or  airspeed,  and/or  loss  of  situational  awareness  during  low-level operations.  Any crew member may initiate this procedure by stating “Emergency Climb.”  If required/called for, execute the procedure as soon as possible.  Table 17.2  lists the steps for the Emergency Climb procedure. Table 17.2.  Emergency Climb Procedure. 1.  Announce “emergency climb” to the crew over interphone. 2.  Execute the 1C-130(M)J-1 Wind Shear Procedures. 3.  Close ramp and door (if open). 4.    Turn  away  (with  consideration  for  stall  margin)  from  terrain  if  feasible.    If  not  possible, AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   165  climb straight ahead for the maximum climb angle. 5.  The PM will monitor and call airspeed as appropriate.  Pilots must monitor stall caret. 6.  The CSO will state an MSA or ESA as appropriate, monitor terrain  (via radar,  chart,  etc.) and “clear of terrain” when above all critical terrain. 7.  When clear of all terrain, adjust pitch, power, and airspeed for a normal climb out and level off. WARNING:  If impact with terrain is imminent, use 100% flaps, 10 knots above the stall caret and crash the aircraft straight ahead. 17.11.  Radar Altimeter Usage. 17.11.1.  Set  radar  altimeter  no  lower  than  20%  below  the  planned  en  route  altitude.  Depending on required altitude profile, illumination, and proficiency, a higher radar altimeter setting may be appropriate. 17.11.1.1.  Set radar altimeter no lower than 100 feet for threat penetration. 17.11.2.  The  PF  will  make  an  immediate  correction  any  time  the  system  provides  an “altitude” annunciation.  (T-2)   Note:  Regardless of the radar altimeter setting used, do not wait for an annunciation to begin a correction. 17.12.  Defensive Maneuvers and Equipment. 17.12.1.  Practice Combat Maneuvers.  All crew members will be prebriefed and advised of the time period/portion of the flight when practice threat maneuvers will be executed.  Crew coordination  is  essential  in  avoiding  injury  to  crew  members  during  practice  threat maneuvers.  (T-2) 17.12.2.  Expendables/ECM  Training.    Conduct  all  expendables  training  IAW  CJCSM 3212.02, Performing Electronic Attack in the United States and Canada for Tests, Training, and Exercises, AFI 11-214, AFI 10-706, Electronic Warfare (EW) Operations, AFI 13-212, Range Planning and Operations, and applicable host nation directives.  Dispense only when approved  by  the  controlling  agency  IAW  agency  procedures  and  restrictions.    When  over open  water,  do  not  drop  expendables  below  500  feet  AGL  or  within  3  nm  of  any  surface vessel, platform, or landmass.  Operational electronic attack (EA) software can only be used for training missions in CONUS, but only after the signal collection risk has been evaluated (see  CJCSM  3212.02  OPSEC  considerations).        WARNING:    Practicing  defensive  threat maneuvering does not constitute authority to deviate from limitations in the flight manual or this instruction. 17.12.3.  Formation Threat Maneuvering.  The optimal situation occurs when the on-board or off-board equipment gives advance warning and all that is required is a deviation around the threat.    As  the  immediacy  of  the  threat  increases,  more  maneuvering  may  be  required.  Maneuvering abruptly or at  high  “G” loads or high bank  angles should be done only when the threat is in sight and no other course of action is available.  During training, emphasis on defensive maneuvering (both single-ship and in formation) should be on early identification and avoidance of threats.  Any threat breaks in formation must be thoroughly briefed prior to flight,  executed  smoothly,  and  terminated  immediately  if  flight  safety  is  compromised.    In   166  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 training,  if  you  lose  sight  of  the  preceding  aircraft  during  a  threat  maneuver,  make  a  radio call  with  your  altitude  and  trend  if  climbing  or  descending,  e.g.,  “RAID  81,  2’s  blind, climbing  through  2,000 feet”.    All  aircraft  will  bring  up  their  lights  and  lead  will  direct altitude separation until the blind aircraft has the preceding aircraft in sight.  (T-2) 17.12.4.  Threat  Penetration.    Visual  pilotage  is  the  primary  height  reference.    Pressure  and radar  altimeters  are  secondary  height  references.    Limit  the  time  spent  at  threat  penetration altitude to the duration needed to avoid the specific threat.  During peacetime, the following restrictions apply: 17.12.4.1.  A  certified  mission  pilot  must  be  in  the  left  seat  or  a  mission  Instructor Pilot/EP in either seat.  (T-2)      WARNING:  Bank angles are restricted below 200 feet AGL; therefore, descending turns must be avoided.  (T-2) 17.13.  Degraded  Systems  Training  (DST).  DST  is  used  to  prepare  crews  to  accomplish  the mission  simulating  certain  pieces  of  equipment  inoperative  (or  intentionally  turned  off  for emission  control).    On  nonlocal  routes,  designate  leg  segments  during  the  route  brief.    The following restrictions and procedures are designed to maximize training and safety. 17.13.1.  Restrictions: 17.13.2.  Visibility must be 5 sm in mountainous terrain.  (T-2) 17.13.3.  One radar altimeter must be operational and on.  (T-2) 17.13.4.  The APN-241 radar must be operational.  (T-2) 17.13.5.  Mission instructor or evaluator must be in either the pilot or CSO position.  (T-2) 17.13.6.  An Instructor (P/CSO) must display/monitor the APN-241 during DST of the radar.  (T2) 17.13.7.  PICs will brief the following items: (T-2) 17.13.7.1.  Equipment simulated inoperative. 17.13.7.2.  Aircrew coordination. 17.13.7.3.  Disorientation and emergency procedures. 17.14.  Self-Contained Approach (SCA). 17.14.1.  Planning. 17.14.1.1.  SCA procedures may be used for approaches to  all landing surfaces, and  for either  overt  or  covert  airland  operations.    Comply  with  local  ATC  restrictions  and  host nation agreements, as appropriate. 17.14.2.  En  Route  Altitude.    The  altitude  profile  may  consist  of  MSL  altitudes,  NVG altitudes, or any combination.  In all cases, an MSL altitude profile will be planned.  (T-2) 17.14.3.  Weather minimums. 17.14.3.1.  SCAs  must  be  conducted  in  VMC  unless  HQ  MAJCOM/A3  approves  IMC operations.    If  approved,  IMC  SCA  weather  minimums  will  be  no  lower  than  200  feet and 1/2 sm.  (T-2) AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   167  17.14.3.2.  For  National  Geospatial-Intelligence  Agency  (NGA)-published  SCAs,  use published minimums. 17.14.4.  Minimum Descent Altitude (MDA).  To compute MDA for VMC operations, add a minimum  of 100 feet  to the Touchdown Zone Elevation (TDZE).  For approved  IMC SCA operations, add a minimum of 200 feet to the TDZE. 17.14.5.  Missed  Approach  Point  (MAP).    The  MAP  will  be  placed  no  further  than  zero distance to go on the mission computer or as required for obstacle clearance on the SCA plate at MDA.  (T-2) 17.14.6.  A full SCA plate for landing runway is required.  Construct  an approach plate for the landing runway using the AF Form 4118, Approach Planning Tool (APT) software, or an OGV-approved planning form. 17.14.7.  Approach Path and Glideslope Construction.  Plan IMC SCAs with a 3° glideslope from  en  route  altitude  unless  terrain  or  obstructions  dictate  a  different  glideslope.    Avoid using  glideslopes  greater  than  5°.    Plan  initial  VMC  SCA  glideslopes  commensurate  with terrain,  obstructions,  threat,  and  aircraft  limitations.    Plan  to  intercept  a  3°  glideslope  at  or before the MDA. 17.14.8.  Chart  Preparation.    Use  the  largest  scale  chart  available  from  10  nm  inbound.    A 1:50,000  chart  is  preferred,  but  in  no  case  will  it  be  larger  than  1:250,000.    Select  position and  altimeter  update  points  and  brief  the  position  to  the  crew  during  route  study.    Chart construction  will  be  IAW  this  chapter  and  include  the  following  additional  items:    The  IP, slowdown  points,  descent  point,  and  the  missed  approach,  departure,  and  go-around  paths.  Ensure update points for the mission computer  and altimeter are  annotated.   It  is  of utmost importance to have sufficient, reliable position and altitude update points prior to the IP and final run-in.  (T-2) 17.15.  SCA Template Construction. 17.15.1.  Use  the  most  current  sources  for  topographic  point  obstruction,  and  airfield information.   Consider using radar  reflectors,  radar beacons, or existing airfield NAVAIDS to increase the reliability of the approach. 17.15.2.  En Route Altitude.  In all cases, an MSL altitude profile will be planned.  (T-2) 17.15.3.  Obstacle  Clearance.    The  location  of  terrain  and  obstructions  will  dictate  the glideslope and altitude profile used.  Use the following procedures to analyze obstacles: (T-2) 17.15.4.  Straight-in  SCAs.    Draw  the  horizontal  obstacle  clearance  template,  depicted  in Figure 17.1, on a 1:250,000 or larger scale chart, if available.  The template begins 0.3 nm either side of LZ centerline at the touchdown point, extending outward to 1 nm either side of centerline  at  3 nm  from  the  touchdown  point  and  then  extended  1  nm  beyond  the  planned descent point (For example, a 3.2 nm planned descent point requires a 4.2 nm long template).  If the planned descent point is less than 2 nm from the touchdown zone, then the standard 3 nm template will not require extension.  (T-2)     Note:  These are minimum distances and may be increased.  Consider such factors as the availability of radar or EO/IR targets, recent NAVAID performance, and time of last system position/altitude update.   168  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 Figure 17.1.  SCA Horizontal Obstruction Clearance Template.  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   169  Figure 17.2.  Turning SCA Horizontal Obstruction Clearance Template (Note  Not to scale)  (1of 2).    170  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 Figure 17.3.  Turning SCA Horizontal Obstruction Clearance Template  (Note  Not to scale)  (2 of 2). 17.15.5.  Turning  and  Circling  SCAs.    The  obstacle  template  for  a  turning  or  circling  SCA consists of a modified version of the straight-in template.  Draw the turning SCA horizontal obstacle clearance template, depicted in  Figure 17.3, on a 1:250,000 or larger scale chart if available.  Draw the straight-in portion of the SCA template as if planning a straight-in SCA.  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   171  Select the feeder distance where the aircraft will intercept runway centerline.  From the pre- planned  radius  intercepting  the  feeder  distance  draw  an  inner  and  outer  corridor.    For  the outer corridor, draw a concentric circle with radius 1.0 nm greater than the planned radius of turn.    For  the  inner  corridor,  draw  a  concentric  circle  with  a  radius  1.0  nm  less  than  the planned radius of turn.  Connect the inner and outer corridors with a line that is perpendicular to  the  approach  path at  the  point  1  nm  prior  to  glideslope    intercept.    When  the  glideslope  intercept occurs  prior to intercepting the turning path, draw lines parallel  to the offset course tangent  to  the  outer  and  inner  corridors.    When  using  a  large  radius  with  a  short  feeder distance,  draw  a  tangent  line  from  the  inner  corridor  to  the  template  0.3  nm  abeam  the runway.  See Figure 17.2 example B.  (T-2) Figure 17.4.  Critical Obstacle Chart. 17.15.6.  Significant  and  Critical  Obstacles.    Using  current  large-scale  charts,  airfield diagrams, airfield sketches, approach plates, and imagery, locate significant obstacles within the  boundary  of  the  horizontal  template.    Significant  obstacles  are  those  within  300  feet  of the desired glideslope.  Determine the HAT for each obstacle by subtracting TDZE from the MSL  elevation  of  the  obstacle.    For  each  obstacle,  plot  the  along-course  distance  from touchdown  and  HAT  on  the  critical  obstacle  graph  as  shown  in  Figure  17.4,  Critical Obstacle Chart.   An obstacle is considered critical if it falls above the reference line for the planned glideslope or its extension along the depicted baseline.    172  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 17.15.7.  For each critical obstacle identified, preplan and brief a specific means of avoidance to  be  used  during  the  approach.    The  following  examples  may  be  used  separately  or  in combination: 17.15.7.1.  Use  a  steeper  glideslope.    Glideslopes  exceeding  4.0°should  be  carefully considered due to the high rate of descent required. 17.15.7.2.  Move the touchdown point further down the runway. 17.15.7.3.  Increase MDA. 17.15.7.4.  Establish  an  intermediate  step-down  altitude  above  the  MDA  at  which  the aircraft will level off until positive separation from the obstacle is assured.  (T-2) 17.15.7.5.  Change  the  approach  to  the  opposite  end  of  the  runway,  to  a  crossing  runway, parallel runway, etc. 17.15.8.  SCA Vertical Template Construction.  Starting at the touchdown zone, construct a glideslope using the desired gradient (feet/nm) to a point along the final approach course (or transition  path,  if  applicable)  where  it  intercepts  the  planned  approach  altitude  (refer  to Figure 17.5) Annotate the glideslope MSL and AGL altitudes for each 0.5 nm distance-to-go increment out to the planned descent point. AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   173  Figure 17.5.  SCA Vertical Template.  17.15.9.  Draw the relative position of each critical obstacle on the template and annotate its distance-to-go, distance abeam final course centerline, and height (AGL and MSL). 17.15.10.  Missed Approach and Departure.  For planning, allow a minimum of 0.3 nm along track error and 0.3 nm cross-track error at the MAP.  Assume IMC when choosing the missed approach/departure flight path.  Construct a horizontal obstacle clearance template beginning at the MAP and incorporating the planned missed approach/departure flight path.  Use TDZE as the MSL start point for the missed approach.  If the terrain along this flight path (including the above errors) rises at a rate greater than 200 feet/nm, refer to the performance manual to verify  that  three-engine  climb  out  will  clear  terrain.    Use  the  three-engine  climb  angle  in place of glideslope.  (T-2) 17.15.11.  The  horizontal  obstacle  clearance  template  for  climb  out  extends  from  the approach end of the runway out to 1.0 nm past level off at the initial escape en route altitude.  The lateral limits of the climb out template are the same as for the straight-in approach. 17.15.12.  If  any  critical  obstacles  are  identified,  consider  using  turns  during  climb  out  to avoid  them.    Ensure  that  the  three-engine  climb  path  provides  sufficient  clearance  from obstacles and terrain along the flight path.   174  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 17.16.  SCA Execution. 17.16.1.  The  Infil/Exfil  checklist  is  mandatory  for  all  SCAs,  with  both  pilots  monitoring system/CSO  guidance.    When  the  mission,  local  ATC  restrictions,  and  host  nation agreements  allow  use  of  covert  lights,  mark  the  runway  as  depicted  in  AFI  13-217,  if required. 17.16.1.1.  General.    Depending  on  the  type  of  landing,  the  Pilot  will  set  lighting  as required.  If the PF requires lights to acquire the LZ, he may call for additional lights as required.    Each  pilot  will  ensure  NVG  batteries  are  operational  during  the  Infil/Exfil checklist.  (T-2) 17.16.1.2.  Instrument  Approaches  using  the  Infil/Exfil  Checklist.    When  the  tactical situation  dictates  flying  an  instrument  approach  while  utilizing  the  Infil/Exfil  checklist, ensure all briefing items from the approach checklist are covered. 17.16.2.  Aircraft  lighting  will  be  as  briefed/directed  by  ground  parties  if  required  for authentication purposes.  The use of covert lighting will be thoroughly briefed in respect to threat, runway environment and authentication procedures.  (T-2) 17.17.  SCA Crew Actions. 17.17.1.  Required warnings and calls. 17.17.1.1.  “20  minute  warning”;  “10  minute  warning”;  “30  seconds  to  slowdown”; “slowdown;” distance call at “2 nm” (from  the landing zone); “begin descent”; “missed approach  point”  (if  other  than  approach  end  of  runway);  and  “100  feet,”  “50  feet,”  “25 feet,”  and “10 feet”  above touchdown.  Additionally, the CSO will update the pilots  on course, distance-to-go, and glidepath profile every 1 nm until 3 nm to go, then every 1/2 nm until the “minimums” call.  (T-2) 17.17.1.2.  The CSO will call additional time advisories as required by the user.  (T-2) 17.17.2.  The PM will back up the flying pilot on the displays and confirm terrain clearance using all available means.  (T-2) 17.17.3.  At the Initial Point: 17.17.3.1.  The CSO will verify final course guidance accuracy.  (T-2) 17.17.3.2.  The CSO will confirm  LZ  alignment  with  the radar and EO/IR (if available) and give final headings as required.  (T-2) 17.17.3.3.  Maintain en route profile until descent for landing. 17.17.4.  Slowdown Procedures. 17.17.4.1.  Slowdown  should  be  initiated  approximately  3  nm  prior  to  the  planned glideslope intercept point.  The slowdown is normally initiated by a call from the CSO. 17.17.4.2.  Slowdown points will be planned and briefed  for tactical  approaches.  Pilots should initiate their own slowdowns for overhead and downwind approaches.  (T-2) 17.17.4.3.  Maintain  a  minimum  of  threshold  speed  for  the  given  flap  configuration (approach speed for turning).  Once the gear is down and locked, track flaps to 100% (if required), and slow no lower than max effort threshold speed (approach speeds for turns). AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   175  17.17.5.  Glideslope Intercept. 17.17.5.1.  The PF will begin descent upon CSO direction or following the flight director cue unless directed otherwise by the CSO.  (T-2) 17.17.5.2.  At glideslope intercept, the CSO will state “Begin Descent” and should repeat the desired initial descent angle.  The CSO will monitor course and glideslope deviation using a PFD.  Report deviations greater than 50 feet vertically, or 50 yards horizontally, along with an advisory as to whether the aircraft is correcting to, paralleling, or diverging from  course/glidepath.  (T-2)     WARNING:   The obstacle clearance procedures in  this chapter  are  not  applicable  to  NVG  operations  conducted  in  a  visual  pattern.    The  pilot must maintain visual contact with the LZ and with surrounding terrain in order to execute a successful approach.  (T-2) WARNING:  The PM and CSO must closely monitor radar altimeters to  ensure  accuracy  of  altimeter settings to  prevent  inadvertently flying below planned AGL minimums.  (T-2) 17.17.6.  Setting  Radar  Altimeters.    Radar  altimeters  should  be  set  no  lower  than  50  feet below decision height or height above touchdown once slowdown has commenced. 17.17.7.  Set the MDA in the Ref Set panel.    WARNING:  Use of a 5° glideslope can cause descent rates in excess of 1,000 feet per minute. 17.17.8.  Descent.    Do  not  descend  below  MDA  until  the  LZ  environment  is  identified visually and confirmed by both pilots.  Whoever identifies the LZ first will call out “ZONE IN SIGHT,” its clock position, and any discrepancies noted (i.e., any lights out, etc.).  Both pilots will then confirm the zone and cross-check the alignment for the proper heading.  (T-2) 17.17.9.  The CSO will use the EO/IR (if available) after completing the final position update to verify the runway has been correctly identified and is clear of obstructions.  (T-2) 17.17.10.  After  Touchdown.        Note:    During  the  initial  Infil/Exfil  brief,  the  pilot  may prebrief the opening of the ramp and door upon reversing of the engines. 17.17.10.1.  The copilot and CSO will assist the pilot in locating the offload/onload point once taxi speed is reached and clear for other aircraft and obstructions.  (T-2) 17.17.10.2.  Use  overt/covert  taxi  and  landing  lights  to  the  minimum  extent  required  to maintain visual references. 17.17.11.  Takeoff. 17.17.11.1.  Accomplish the ON THE RUNWAY portion of the INFIL/EXFIL checklist. 17.17.11.2.  The  CSO  will  provide  a  departure  heading,  altitude,  and considerations.  (T-2) terrain 17.17.11.3.  The PF will make the takeoff wearing NVGs.  The PM will wear NVGs and be prepared to fly the planned departure on NVGs or transition to instruments and fly the CSO’s directions in the event of NVG failure.  (T-2) 17.17.11.4.  Use  IR  taxi  and  landing  lights  to  the  minimum  extent  required  to  maintain visual references during takeoff roll.  Interior lighting is the same as for the approach and landing.  The PF and PM will clear the LZ for obstacles.  (T-2)   176  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 17.17.11.5.  Use normal  takeoff performance unless max effort performance is required.  At refusal speed, the copilot calls "Go."  At takeoff speed, the copilot calls "Rotate."  If takeoff and refusal speed are equal, the copilot will only state "Rotate." (T-2) 17.17.11.6.  At takeoff speed, the PF will rotate the aircraft to establish a positive climb rate.  The PM checks the pitch attitude and will raise the landing gear on the command of the PF after ensuring a positive rate of climb.  The PM may take control of the aircraft if directed by the PF and continue the climb out to the egress route altitude.  (T-2) 17.17.11.7.  The  CSO  will  advise  the  pilots  of  the  initial  on  course  heading  and  call altitudes climbing from 100 through 300 feet AGL in 100 foot increments.  (T-2) 17.17.11.8.  As soon as conditions permit, the loadmaster will check equipment restraint and condition/needs of the onboard user.  (T-2) 17.17.12.  Go-Around and Departure Procedures.     CAUTION:  Pilots are more susceptible to spatial disorientation during NVG go-arounds and departures. 17.17.12.1.  When  executing  a  go-around  or  departure,  the  CSO  will  state  the  initial heading  and  “Climb  to  XXX  feet”  or  MSA.    State  radar  altimeter  values  when  passing through “100”, “200”, “300” feet.  (T-2) 17.17.12.1.1.  If an immediate approach and landing are not feasible, state intentions, complete the After Takeoff Checklist and proceed as planned. 17.17.12.1.2.  If  an  immediate  landing  is  feasible  and  desired,  the  PF  will  announce intentions and maneuver to  a VFR pattern.  Maneuver the  aircraft to  be  wings level and configured at a minimum of 300 feet AGL and 1 nm final for an SCA or AMP-4 CR.  Pilots will call the zone “in sight” as they turn final and CSO will make standard altitude advisory calls on descent.  (T-2) 17.17.13.  Loss of NVGs: 17.17.13.1.  Before  Landing.   If the pilot  or copilot  loses use of their NVGs inside of 1 nm, perform a go-around. 17.17.13.2.  After  Takeoff.    The  PF  should  transfer  aircraft  control  and  continue  the climb out.  Consider transitioning to instruments or overt lighting. 17.17.13.3.  On  the  Ground.    The  PF  will  determine  whether  to  continue  the  landing rollout or takeoff roll as applicable.  The PM should be prepared to turn on overt lighting at the direction of the PIC in case of NVG failure during takeoff or landing roll.  (T-2) 17.18.  Airdrop Operations. 17.18.1.  General Airdrop. 17.18.1.1.  Each CSO performing an airdrop will compute a CARP/HARP.  (T-2) 17.18.1.1.1.  The  CSO  will  plot  and  brief  the  CARP/HARP  location  on  a drop  zone mosaic.  Drop  Zone  mosaic  will  be  annotated  with  run-in  course,  CARP/HARP location,  load  type/weight/chute,  visual  references  (as  required),  red  light  location, 10-second  location,  ballistic  winds,  drop  safety  box,  escape/racetrack,  and  all  other requirements outlined in AFI 11-231. AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   177  17.18.1.2.  Airdrops will normally be system-directed drops backed up by the pilots and CSO.  (T-2) 17.18.1.3.  Airdrops may be conducted in IMC or VMC.  For detailed information on DZ sizes, markings, types, weather, and wind limits, refer to AFI 13-217.  For information on aerial delivery airspeeds, altitudes, and computations refer to AFI 11-231. 17.18.1.4.  Airdrop  Kits.    The  loadmaster  will  refer  to  the  Loadmaster  Procedures (Chapter 13) of this instruction for items contained in airdrop kits.  (T-2) 17.18.1.5.  Specific  in-flight  visual  signals,  verbal  signals,  and  interphone  procedures between  the  jumpmaster  and  loadmaster  must  be  coordinated  during  the  jumpmaster briefing.  (T-2) 17.18.1.6.  Required Navigation Accuracy.  The navigation accuracy required for a given mission  will  vary  depending  on  the  type  of  mission  and  other  considerations.    For airdrops,  to  provide  an  early  indication  of  degraded  navigation  accuracy,  set  the  POS ALERT(s)  at  0.03  nm  (~  55  yards;  FOM  2)  and  0.05  nm  (~  110  yards;  FOM  4).  Normally,  airdrop  accuracy  requirements  (300  yd  Computed  Air  Probability)  are  met  if the ship solution is FOM 4 or better and no POS ALERT is indicated.  If these conditions are  not  met,  further  action  (radar  or  visual  cross-check/update)  is  necessary  to verify/improve navigation accuracy prior to performing airdrops.  (T-2) 17.18.1.7.  Minimum  en  route  time  from  takeoff  to  time  over  release  point  will  be sufficient  to  safely accomplish  all required checklists.  For airdrop involving personnel, the jumpmaster must approve en route time of less than 25 minutes.  (T-2) 17.18.1.8.  Jumpmaster  Directed  Airdrop (JMD).  Jumpmaster  directed  (JMD) personnel  airdrops  require  OG/CC    approval.    The  OG/CC  may  delegate  to  the  unit  or mission commander.  The user accepts all responsibility for airdrop accuracy and damage to equipment or injury to personnel. 17.18.1.8.1.  During  JMD,  the  jumpmaster  determines  the  release  point  (RP) mathematically or by wind drift indicator.  The jumpmaster directs the aircraft to the RP using steering commands to the aircrew.  CSOs will accomplish CARP or HARP calculations  to  back  up  the  computations  and  in-flight  directions  given  by  the jumpmaster.  (T-2) 17.18.1.8.2.  Jumpmaster  directed  drops  are  limited  to  single-ship  airdrop  operations only.  The following conditions apply: 17.18.1.8.2.1.  After the slowdown checks are completed, the loadmaster permits the jumpmaster access to the door to begin "spotting procedures."  The slowdown should be adjusted to allow the jumpmaster to begin spotting procedures at least two minutes out from the HARP.  The jumpmaster visually relays steering signals to the loadmaster, who verbally relays these signals to the pilot.  The jumpmaster may spot from the aircraft ramp or a paratroop door. 17.18.1.8.2.2.  Upon  entering  the  leading  edge  of  the  updated  LAR  (or  as coordinated  with  the  Jumpmaster),  the  PM  turns  on  the  green  light  to  indicate clearance for the jumpmaster to  make  a  final  decision as to  the  exact  exit point.  Jumpers  may  exit  on  the  jumpmaster’s  direction  while  the  green  light  is   178  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 illuminated.  The red light is turned on at the end of the CSO’s computed usable DZ  distance  (or  green  light  time  IAW  AFI  13-217,  AFSOC  Supp)  or  when  the last jumper or load exits, whichever occurs first.  No jumpers should exit after the red light is turned on. 17.18.1.8.2.3.  JMD  releases  will  not  be  mixed  with  any  other  type  of  airdrop method,  i.e.,  GMRS,  VIRS,  or  standard  Computed  Air  Release  Point  (CARP) drops.    If  JMD  drop  procedures  are  utilized,  the  crew  will  follow  the jumpmaster’s instructions, while adhering to normal safety concerns.  Should the crew believe the drop would occur outside of safe parameters, they will call “no drop” and ensure the red light is illuminated.  (T-2) 17.18.2.  Airdrop Planning. 17.18.2.1.  Crews  will  not  perform  airdrops  using  parachutes  for  which  AFI  11-231, Computed Air Release Point Procedures, does not list ballistics unless the user provides ballistic data or K factor that has been verified by HQ AFSOC/A3V.  This does not apply to  formal  test  missions  where  the  purpose  of  the  test  is  to  derive  ballistic  data  for  a specific load.  (T-2) 17.18.2.2.  The PIC and the CSO will review the DZ survey during mission planning.  (T-2) 17.18.3.  Airdrop Communications Procedures. 17.18.3.1.  During airdrop, after acknowledgement of the 20-minute warning and donning of the helmet, loadmasters may clear off interphone, with the PIC’s approval, to facilitate movement  around  large  platforms  or  CDS  loads.    The  CSO  will  accomplish  the  brief associated  with  the  20-  minute  warning.    After  completing  the  required  20-minute checklist  items,  the  primary  loadmaster  will  remain  on  interphone  throughout  the remainder of the airdrop.  (T-2) 17.18.3.2.  Training Operations.  Limit radio transmissions with the DZ to those required for  safety  of  flight  considerations  or  factors  affecting  airborne  force  employment.    This includes ATC directions, range clearance, unsafe surface conditions or mission changes.  When the mission  dictates radio  silence, transmission of wind information and range or drop clearance is not required.  Coordinated radio silence procedures will be coordinated prior to mission execution.  (T-2) 17.18.3.3.  Drop clearance is normally inherent with mission clearance to unmanned DZs.  The  aircrew  observing  the  proper  briefed  authentication  confirms  drop  clearance  in VMC. 17.18.3.4.  In  VMC,  a  no-drop  or  mission  cancellation  is  communicated by  the  absence of  prebriefed  markings  (visual  or  electronic),  jumbled  block  letter,  observation  of  the block letter X, or red smoke, light, flare, or as briefed. 17.18.3.5.  In  IMC, drop clearance is confirmed via radio call or beacon acquisition.  In IMC,  a  no-drop  or  mission  cancellation  is  communicated  by  an  authenticated  radio transmission or absence of the beacon. AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   179  17.18.4.  Ramp and Door and Paratroop Door Operations.    WARNING:  The ramp and door and  paratroop  doors  will  not  be  open  at  the  same  time.    High  speed  operations  with  the paratroop doors open will not be accomplished during training missions.  (T-2) 17.18.4.1.  Air Deflector Doors.  If an air deflector door cannot be opened, its respective paratroop door will not be used.  (T-2) 17.18.4.2.  Clearance to Open.  The PIC may direct ramp and door opening any time after the Six-minute advisory for personnel drops, or as mission requirements dictate for non-personnel  drops.    After  the  ramp  and  door  are  open,  the  loadmasters  are  cleared  to complete their slowdown checklist. 17.18.4.2.1.  High-Speed  Low-Level  Delivery  System  (HSLLADS).    The  pilot  may direct  the  CSO  to  call  the  three-minute  warning  as  early  as  mission  requirements dictate.    This  option  must  be  planned  and  pre-briefed  prior  to  execution.    Consider added drag, power available, climb requirements, built up areas, airdrop rigging, and the possibility of dropped objects when the door is opened.  (T-2) 17.18.4.3.  Do not open the ramp and door to accomplish SATB/simulated airdrops with loads rigged with an extraction parachute in the bomb rack or HSLLADS sling attached.  If  the  actual  airdrop  loads  cannot  be  dropped,  the  extraction  parachute  will  be  removed from  the  bomb  rack  and  secured  forward  of  the  load  and  HSLLADS  slings  will  be disconnected.  (T-2)   After  completion  of  the  Slowdown 17.18.4.4.  Loadmaster-Jumpmaster  Control. Checklist, the primary loadmaster will relinquish control of the paratroop doors/ramp and door to the jumpmaster.  The loadmasters will then take a position on the cargo ramp in such  a  manner  as  to  provide  maximum  maneuverability  for  jumpmasters  and  safety personnel to perform their duties.  For ramp and cargo door exits, the loadmaster(s) will take  a  position  to  prevent  interference  with  exiting  jumpers.    Upon  seeing  the  red  light illuminate, the primary loadmaster will notify the jumpmasters or safety personnel of the red  light  condition.    The  loadmaster  will  take  no  further  action  to  stop  any  of  the remaining parachutists.  The loadmasters will count (if possible) any parachutists that exit the aircraft after the red light has illuminated.  Control of the paratroop doors/ramp and door  will  revert  back  to  the  loadmasters  after  all  parachutists  have  exited  or  remaining parachutists  have  been  stopped  by  the  jumpmaster  or  safety  and  cleared  from  the  door area.    For  multiple  passes  (racetracks),  after  assuming  control  of  the  paratroop doors/ramp  and door from  the jumpmaster, the loadmasters will maintain control of the doors  until  completion  of  subsequent  Slowdown  Checklists.    (T-2)            WARNING:  During  personnel  airdrops,  the  loadmasters  will  not  position  themselves  directly  under the  aft  anchor  cable  supports  (A-Frame,  FS  737).    (T-2)          WARNING:    Ensure  all personnel aft of FS 737 are secured to the aircraft or have a static line connected prior to opening  the  ramp  and door.  HALO/HAHO personnel  must be  configured and  ready  to jump. 17.18.4.5.  Multiple  Passes/Racetracks.    When  performing  multiple  equipment  airdrops across  the  same  DZ,  all  airdrop  checklists  will  be  accomplished.    When  performing multiple  personnel  drops  across  the  same  DZ,  checklists  may  resume  at  the  6  minute warning assuming no airdrop parameters or aircraft configuration changes are made from the  previous  drop.    Ensure  the  loadmaster  has  adequate  time  to  complete  all  checklist   180  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 items before the drop.  (T-2)     Exception:  During non-JMD airdrops, the checklist may be initiated at a point commensurate with the available time and type of drop.  This will be coordinated at the Pilot/ Loadmaster/Jumpmaster/Troop Commander Briefing.  When airdrop  parameters  or  aircraft  configuration  changes  are  made  between  drops,  all checklists  will  be  accomplished.    Airdrop  time  advisories  and  checklists  may  be compressed, except for the one minute warning.  Doors may remain open at the discretion of the PF.  (T-2) 17.18.4.6.  Tailgate Drops.  The following restrictions apply: 17.18.4.6.1.  Rig both anchor cables and both static line retrievers prior to takeoff (if applicable). 17.18.4.6.2.  Use one anchor cable for each pass and limit each pass to a maximum of 20 static lines (19 personnel with a CRRC or 18 with a RAMZ). 17.18.4.6.3.  Use the opposite anchor cable if another pass is required. 17.18.4.6.4.  Retrieve static lines and deployment bags prior to each additional pass. 17.18.5.  Airdrop Execution. 17.18.5.1.  Positioning.  Accurately positioning the aircraft at the release point is the most critical  phase of the airdrop mission.  Crew coordination is  of the utmost importance to ensure that all checklists are completed, proper DZ line-up is maintained. 17.18.5.2.  System/Visual Airdrops.  The primary method for aerial delivery is automatic release at the computer derived release point.  Visual Airdrops are authorized. 17.18.5.3.  CSOs  will  update  the  jumpmaster  in-flight  on  actual  wind  information  and any changes to the crew’s preflight computed CARP/HARP location.  The crew will also update  the  jumpmaster  with  the  local  altimeter  setting  for  the  planned  drop  zone  (if available) at the 10minute warning.  The jumpmaster will reconfirm this setting with the aircrew.  (T-2) 17.18.5.4.  Approved  computer-aided  CARP  and  HARP  software  may  be  used,  but  the CSO must verify the results.  (T-2) 17.18.5.5.  The CSO will verify the actual number and type of parachutes, load weights, sequence of delivery, and position of loads in the aircraft.  Recalculate  CARP/HARP if actual  conditions  differ  from  the  preplanned  configuration.    (T-2)            WARNING:  Military CYPRES AADs require both a descent below 1,500 feet AGL and 115 feet per second  (6900  vvi)  descent  rate  threshold  before  it  will  deploy  the  reserve  parachute.  Jumpmasters will program the CYPRES in flight if en route time exceeds one hour to the drop  zone,  and  require  an  accurate  local  altimeter  setting  to  do  so.    A  programmed altimeter  setting  significantly  different  from  the  actual  local  altimeter  can  result  in unintended  deployment  of  the  reserve  canopy  or  failure  to  deploy  when  needed, endangering MFF personnel.  Use of auto-pressurization can also cause activation of the CYPRES AAD just after take-off in certain situations. 17.18.5.6.  Safety Device.  Provide safety personnel with parachutes carried on board the aircraft.    They  may  use  a  restraint  harness  at  their  discretion,  if  available.    Provide  a restraint harness to other personnel required to be mobile in the cargo compartment. AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   181  17.18.5.7.  A  DD  Form  1748,  Joint  Airdrop  Inspection  Record,  will  be  accomplished prior to  all equipment  airdrops.  Completion, retention, and disposition of the form  will be in  accordance with  the AFJ 13-210(I), as supplemented.  (T-2)     Exception:  A-7A and  A-21  containers  rigged  for  door  bundles.    The  aerial  delivery  unit  supporting movement of equipment and supplies will ensure current publications are available to the loadmaster  to  ensure  standardization  of  joint  inspections.    Aerial  delivery  units supporting  AFSOC  unilateral  airdrop training  will  provide  copies  of  required publications.  (T-2) 17.18.5.8.  In-flight  Rigging  Procedures.    In-flight  rigging  is  a  safe  procedure  if accomplished  under  a  controlled  situation.    Accomplish  in-flight  rigging  only  when  the safety  of  the  personnel  required  to  be  mobile  in  the  cargo  compartment  is  not jeopardized.  The aircraft may have to depart the formation or change altitude.  Use the following procedures on airdrop missions that require in-flight rigging: 17.18.5.8.1.  Two  loadmasters  are  required,  except  for  SATB.    At  least  one loadmaster  will  remain  on  interphone  at  all  times.    When  only  one  loadmaster  is assigned to the crew and in-flight rigging of an SATB is required, a crew member on interphone  will  observe  the  in-flight  rigging  from  a  forward  position  in  the  cargo compartment.  (T-2) 17.18.5.8.2.  The use of a pendulum rigging step is optional. 17.18.5.8.3.  Make  an  in-flight  check  of  the  rigged  items  using  the  DD  Form  1748.    WARNING:  For personnel airdrops, the pilot must be aware of paratroopers standing and avoid drastic pitch, bank, and power changes after the Ten Minute Warning.  Use of  autothrottles  may  cause  drastic  speed  changes  resulting  in  an  unstable  platform.  (T-2) 17.18.5.9.  Airspeed adjustments should be completed prior to slowdown. 17.18.5.10.  If the IP is visible from a distance and time control permits, overfly the IP on run-in  heading.    Otherwise,  fly  a  curved-path  leg  to  the  DZ.    If  required,  update navigation equipment at the IP. 17.18.5.11.  After  departing  the  IP,  the  PM  assists  the  CSO  in  maintaining  the  desired track inbound by confirming aircraft position with the planned run-in update points. 17.18.5.12.  The  CSO  provides  headings  that  will  position  the  aircraft  the  required distance upwind from centerline track so that large corrections will not be required on the final approach to the release point.  (T-2) 17.18.5.13.  Slowdown  Procedures.    During  airdrop  operations,  the  CSO  will  direct  the slowdown  maneuver  at  a  predetermined  point.    Begin  slowdown  at  a  distance commensurate  with  aircraft  performance  and  proficiency  of  the  crew.    Decrease slowdown distance as proficiency increases and the threat dictates.  If known threats are in  the  objective  area,  decrease  the  slowdown  distance  to  reduce  the  time  the  aircraft  is vulnerable at drop altitude and airspeed.  After the CSO calls for the slowdown: (T-2) 17.18.5.13.1.  The PF normally retards the power levers to flight idle. 17.18.5.13.2.  The PM lowers the flaps on speed.   182  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 17.18.5.13.3.  For  paratroop  door  drops,  the  PM  opens  the  air  deflector  doors  upon slowing  below  150  KCAS.    Once  air  deflector  doors  are  called  open,  this automatically clears the LM to open the paratroop doors. 17.18.5.13.4.  For  tailgate  drops,  the  CSO  will  call  “30-seconds  to  slowdown—DOORS”  as  part  of  the  30-second  warning,  followed  by  the  PF  stating  “clear  to open”, the LM opens the cargo door and ramp. 17.18.5.13.5.  For CDS drops, reset the flaps IAW the CDS flap setting chart. 17.18.6.  Airdrop Execution.  During the final  seconds of the approach to  the release point, the PM places a hand near the jump light switch.  Ten seconds prior to release, the CSO will give a preparatory call of “10 seconds.”  At this call, if the aircraft location is not within pre-coordinated parameters, a “no-drop” condition exists. 17.18.6.1.  At the release point: 17.18.6.1.1.  The CSO will state “green light”.  (T-2) 17.18.6.1.2.  The PM will either monitor or turn on the green light and verbally calls the light “ON” as directed by the pilot.  (T-2) 17.18.6.1.3.  During the drop: 17.18.6.1.4.  The loadmaster will not deploy equipment or personnel until hearing and seeing  the  green  light.    If  mission  dictates  during  contingency  operations,  aircrews may  coordinate  for  loadmasters  to  only  require  visual  or  aural  green  light confirmation.  (T-2) 17.18.6.1.5.  The pilot will make any small corrections required to maintain the track.  (T-2) 17.18.6.1.6.  The CSO will monitor the time to “red light.” (T-2) 17.18.6.1.7.  The  loadmaster  will  advise  the  pilot  when  the  load  is  clear  and  of  any delay or malfunction.  (T-2) 17.18.7.  IMC Airdrop. 17.18.7.1.  IMC  Drop  Altitude.    Plan  minimum  IMC  drop  altitudes  at  MSA  or  as specified in AFI 11-231, whichever is higher. 17.18.7.2.  IFR Drop Corridor.  As defined in FAR Exemption 4371L, operations must be conducted at 250 feet (with TF/TA radar systems) above the highest obstacles along the route of flight,  or 500 feet  (without  TF/TA) above the highest  obstacles within 3 nm of the  course  to  be  flown  over  mountainous  or  other  areas.    (T-2)          Note:    Crews  may segment drop corridor MSAs as mission requirements dictate. 17.18.7.2.1.  DZ  Entry  Point.    The  DZ  entry  point  is  a  fixed  point  on  DZ  run-in course where an aircraft or formation of aircraft may safely begin descent from IMC en route altitude to IMC drop altitude.  The DZ entry point is a maximum of 40 nm prior  to  the  DZ  exit  point  according  to  FAA  FAR  exemption  4371C.    Formation descent will not begin until the last aircraft in the formation is at or past the DZ entry point.    (T-2)          WARNING:    Analyze  pre-drop  gross  weight  to  determine  if obstructions  can  be  cleared  on  three-engines  from  DZ  Entry  through  DZ  Exit.    If AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   183  obstructions  cannot  be  cleared,  adjust  the  number  of  aircraft,  reduce  aircraft  gross weight, revise run-in and/or escape course, or increase drop altitude. 17.18.7.2.2.  DZ  Exit  Point.    The  DZ  exit  point  is  a  fixed  point  on  the  DZ  escape flight path centerline, established during pre-mission planning, at which the formation will  be  at  the  minimum  IMC  en  route  altitude.    Calculate  the  exit  point  based  upon three-engine performance at airdrop gross weight.  This point will be planned no less than 4 nm track distance beyond the DZ trailing edge.  (T-2) 17.18.8.  Visual Airdrops.  Reserved for Future use. 17.18.9.  No-Drop Decisions.  In addition to TO 1C-130(M)J-1 No-Drop conditions: 17.18.9.1.  Prior  to  the  1-  or  2-minute  (for  high-altitude)  warning,  notify  the  PIC  when any condition exists that could jeopardize a safe drop. 17.18.9.2.  After  the  1-  or  2-minute  (for  high-altitude)  warning,  any  crew  member observing  a  condition  that  would  jeopardize  a  safe  drop  will  transmit  "No-drop"  on  the interphone.  (T-2) 17.18.9.3.  Stopping  a  Drop  In  Progress.    Any  crew  member  recognizing  an  unsafe condition  during  an  airdrop  will  state  "red  light".    The  PM  will  turn  on  the  red  light  to signal the airdrop termination.  (T-2) 17.18.9.4.  On personnel airdrops where surface winds are unknown, (such as unmanned DZs) advise the jumpmaster and Army airborne mission commander when drop altitude winds  exceed  30  kts.    In  this  instance,  the  decision  to  drop  is  at  user's  discretion.   WARNING:    Coordination  between  the  PF  and  Loadmaster  should  be  accomplished prior to the airdrop to prevent injury of aircrew in the back of the aircraft once the power levers are advanced to max power for the escape. 17.18.10.  Departure  from  DZ  (Escape).    The  CSO  will  call  “red  light”  at  the  expiration  of the  “green  light”  time.    When  the  LM  calls  “load  clear”,  immediately  begin  the  escape maneuver by tracking flaps as required, turn to the departure heading, and climb or descend to the escape altitude.  Do not exceed 140 KCAS (except HSLLADS) until the static lines are retrieved  to  facilitate  static  line  retrieval  and  preclude  entanglement.    Close  all  doors,  raise flaps, and accelerate to en route airspeed.  It is imperative that the aircraft be configured for high speed evasive maneuvers.  Therefore, after the static lines have been retrieved or cut, the doors and air deflectors closed, and flaps raised, the remainder of the post-drop checklist may be deferred to a more convenient time while returning to the recovery base.  (T-2) 17.18.11.  Static Line Retrieval.  KCAS.  Loadmasters should allow a few moments for static lines  to  wrap  together  before  retrieving  static  lines.    Designated  aircrew  members  will retrieve static lines as soon as possible after parachutist or bundle exit is completed or exiting is suspended.  During combat, static lines that cannot be retrieved will be cut so doors can be closed.    If  the  static  line  retriever  fails,  static  lines  will  be  manually  retrieved  using  a  tie-down  strap  as  follows.    (T-2)        Note:    A  maximum  of  ten  static  lines  may  be  retrieved manually per paratroop door.  A maximum of 20 static lines per cable may be retrieved with a static line retriever winch. 17.18.11.1.  Static Line Retriever alternate recovery procedures:   184  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 17.18.11.2.  The  following  procedures  will  be  used  when  the  Static  Line  Retrieval System is unavailable.  (T-2) 17.18.11.2.1.  Paratroop Door. 17.18.11.2.1.1.  Secure  the  hook  end  of  a  cargo  strap  to  a  point  far  enough forward  in  the  cargo  compartment  to  allow  static  lines  to  completely  enter  the aircraft. 17.18.11.2.1.2.  Insert the other end of the cargo strap from the bottom up, making a "U" around the static lines. 17.18.11.2.1.3.  Pull the strap forward to retrieve the static  lines into the aircraft.  Loadmasters may require assistance to pull the strap forward. 17.18.11.2.2.  Ramp and Door. 17.18.11.2.2.1.  If  the  static  line  retriever  fails  following  a  combination/tailgate drop,  use  the  Prusik  Knot  as  described  below.    Refer  to  Figure  17.15,  Prusik Knot. 17.18.11.2.2.2.  Take a 30 inch piece of 1/2-inch tubular nylon cord that is tied in a loop.  Loop the cord around the static line retriever cable as shown in the figure.  Use a minimum of three wraps around the retriever cable to ensure locking of the 1/2-inch tubular nylon cord. 17.18.11.2.2.3.  Pull  to  tighten  the  knot  around  the  retriever  winch  cable  to prevent slipping.  Attach the hook end of a 5,000 pound strap into the loop's end and pull in the static lines.  The 1/2-inch tubular nylon cord will remain locked in place under tension.  (T-2) 17.18.11.2.2.4.  More than one 1/2-inch tubular nylon cord may be attached to the winch  cable  using  the  Prusik  Knot  to  facilitate  static  line  retrieval.    The  Prusik Knot may be adjusted up or down the cable as required.  The knot will not slip as long  as  it  is  wrapped  tightly  with  a  minimum  of  three  turns  (more  wraps  equal more friction), and tension is applied.  (T-2) 17.18.11.2.2.5.  To prevent cutting the 1/2-inch tubular nylon cord with the hook on  the  5,000-  pound  strap,  a  carabineer  may  be  attached  to  the  1/2-inch  tubular nylon cord loop and the hook attached to carabineer. AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   185  Figure 17.6.  Prusik Knot.  17.18.12.  Airdrop  Malfunction  and  Emergencies.    Specific  emergency  procedures  for  each type  airdrop  are  located  in  the  TO  1C-130(M)J-1  checklists,  or  appropriate  MAJCOM-approved  guidance.    After  all  appropriate  emergency  actions  are  complete,  accomplish  the COMPLETION OF DROP checklist.   Note:  Prior to stations time, the pilot will ensure all crew  members  have  reviewed  the  emergency  procedures  for  the  proposed  airdrop.    The aircrew will conduct detailed emergency briefings.  Loadmasters will brief visual and verbal signals  and  establish  coordinated  tasks  for  their  crew  position  prior  to  the  first  airdrop warning.  (T-2) 17.18.13.  Combination  Drops.    Combination  drops  are  when  parachutists  exit  after  the airdrop load.  The item requiring the highest altitude will determine the drop altitude.  (T-2) 17.18.13.1.  Restrictions.    A  maximum  of  20  personnel  static  lines may  be  deployed  on each pass  and only one  anchor  cable  will be used for these static lines.   Static lines for   186  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 equipment will be attached to opposite anchor cables and must be rigged for breakaway.  (T-2)    Exception:  When airdrop loads are rigged with pilot chutes packed in T-10 bags, they  will be  attached to  the same  anchor cable as personnel.   Maximum  static lines per cable are 20.  Static lines will be retrieved after each pass.  (T-2) 17.18.13.2.  Procedures.    In  addition  to  the  equipment  CARP,  the  CSO  will  compute  a personnel  CARP  down  track  from  the  equipment  release  point  using  the  computed  exit time for the equipment drop as the interval between the equipment and personnel CARP.  Use  the  same  airspeed  and  altitude  as  for  the  equipment  for  this  computation.    If  the computed  release  point  will  result  in  any  jumper  landing  within  150  yards  of  any boundary  of  the  DZ,  inform  the  jumpmaster.    Release  the  equipment  at  the  equipment CARP, followed by the  parachutists when the door is  clear.  (T-2)       Exception:  For door and ramp bundles, use release points as specified in Paragraph 17.18.18.2.3. 17.18.14.  Low-Altitude Airdrops.  For detailed information,  refer to  AFTTP  3-3 MC-130J.  Refer to the expanded checklist for normal and emergency airdrop procedures. 17.18.15.  High-Altitude Airdrop Procedures. 17.18.15.1.  Airdrops  conducted  above  3,000  feet  AGL  are  considered  high-altitude drops.    For  HALO,  positive  identification  of  the  drop  zone  area  must  be  confirmed electronically or visually prior to calling the release.  For HALO or HAHO, all available navigational aids will be used to assist in positioning the aircraft over the HARP.  (T-2) 17.18.15.1.1.  To  the  maximum  extent  possible  on  training  and  exercise  missions, unless prevented by airspace restrictions or other mission factors, update the preflight winds at each altitude used to compute the HARP.  Obtain these winds as near the DZ as possible.  Refer to Paragraph 17.18.21.3.1 for use of dropsonde wind data. 17.18.15.1.2.  Drop  scores  are  required  after  each  pass  in  order  to  ascertain  the presence  or  previously  unobserved  wind  phenomena  (i.e.,  wind  shear)  or  other environmental considerations  in  the  vicinity of the drop zone.  Aircrews conducting military free fall training operations will coordinate with drop zone control personnel to  obtain drop scores after each pass  in  order to  make any necessary  adjustments to subsequent  passes.    Crews  will  pass  this  information  to  the  jumpmasters  for consideration prior to each subsequent pass.  (T-2) 17.18.15.1.3.  High-Altitude  Mission  Requirements.    In  addition  to  the  normal mission planning requirements, the following are unique to high-altitude operations: 17.18.15.1.4.  Aircrew will ensure all aspects of HALO/HAHO airdrops are discussed in  detail  at  the  aircrew/jumpmaster  briefing.    Insist  on  positive  feedback  when discussing  HARP  location  and  wind  data  as  well  as  resolving  what  items  will  be passed  to  the  jumpmaster  during  flight.    Terminology  should  be  clear  and unambiguous.  (T-2) 17.18.15.1.5.  For  high-altitude/MFF  training  operations,  crews  will  program  the CNI-MU with either a safety factor of no less than 80%, or an approach/safety of not less than 1,000 feet.  (T-2) 17.18.15.1.6.  For  all  HALO/HAHO  operations,  CSOs  will  provide  the  jumpmaster with  a magnetic course  ± 5° and a distance from  the release point to  the drop zone.  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   187  In-flight changes to the HARP location or significant wind changes will be relayed to the jumpmaster as soon as possible.  (T-2) 17.18.15.1.7.  During  all  MFF  drops  once  the  green  light  is  on,  crews  may  delay turning on the red light until they reach the trailing edge of the updated LAR, minus an appropriate safety percentage, if applicable.  During crew directed drops the green light shall be turned on at the computed release point or at  a point coordinated with the jumpmaster, provided if falls within the LAR.  During JMD drops the crew will turn  on  the  green  light  upon  entering  the  leading  edge  of  the  updated  LAR,  or  as coordinated  with  the  Jumpmaster.      At  any  point  during  the  airdrop  sequence  if  the crew believes the drop may occur outside safe parameters turn on the red light.  (T-2) 17.18.15.1.8.  Cabin  differential  pressure  will  be  managed  to  have  cabin  altitude equal  to  the  ambient  pressure  prior  to  completion  of  the  10-minute  checklist.  Depressurization will not exceed 3,000 feet per minute.  Pressurization after the drop will  be  maintained  in  accordance  with  mission  requirements,  but  should  return  to  a cabin altitude commensurate to the flight profile and duration as detailed in AFI 11-202, Vol 3, or below 10,000 feet MSL as soon as possible.  (T-2) 17.18.15.1.9.  High-Altitude  Oxygen  requirements.    Only  essential  personnel  should be  carried  on  mission  aircraft  during  airdrop  operations.    AFI 11-202,  Vol  3,  is  the source document for oxygen requirements for unpressurized and pressurized aircraft operations  and  the  associated  time  limitations.    AFI  11-409,  High-Altitude  Airdrop Mission  Support  Program,  is  the  source  document  for  high-altitude  oxygen,  pre-breathing, and Physiology Technician (PT) requirements/restrictions. 17.18.15.1.10.  Incident  Notification.    USAF/SGPA  and  MAJCOM/SG  will  be notified by the most expeditious manner of any physiological incident.  (T-2) 17.18.15.1.11.  General  Emergency  Procedures. decompression sickness or unusual pain, the pilot will: (T-2)  If  any  person  experiences 17.18.15.1.12.  Abort the mission and begin a descent (pressurization and descent will be determined by the type and degree of sickness or pain). 17.18.15.1.13.  Proceed  to  the  nearest  base  at  which  qualified  medical  assistance  is available.    Advise  the  control  tower  of  the  emergency  and  request  a  flight  surgeon and an ambulance to meet the aircraft. 17.18.16.  Personnel Drops: 17.18.16.1.  Aircraft Configuration.  The loadmaster will ensure the configuration of the anchor  cables  and  seats  are  consistent  with  the  number  of  personnel  to  be  airdropped.  During  aircraft  preflight,  the  loadmaster  will  ensure  that  all  seats  have  a  serviceable retaining  strap  attached.    Fit  seats  without  a  serviceable  retaining  strap  with  a  suitable length  of type  III  nylon, premeasured for sufficient  length  to  secure the  seat  in  a raised position  to  the  seat  back  support  frame.    For  single  pass  drops,  ensure  that  parachutists have secured all seats  (as required) and no part  of the seat  protrudes into the aisle.   On multiple  passes,  the  number  of  parachutists  to  be  dropped  on  that  pass  determines  the number of seats raised.  Troop seats will be raised and secured, or lowered, as required,   188  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 by  personnel  under  the  supervision  and  instruction  of  the  loadmaster.    Floor  loading  is authorized in accordance with Chapter 6.  (T-2) 17.18.16.2.  Aircraft Emergency During Personnel Airdrop.  When an aircraft emergency occurs  during  or  after  the  time  the  parachutists  stand  and  hookup,  the  following procedures will apply: (T-2) 17.18.16.2.1.  Under  acceptable  conditions  when  parachutists  bailout  is  required, maintain  an  acceptable  altitude  and  attitude  for  the  parachutists  to  evacuate  the aircraft.  The minimum acceptable altitude is as briefed.  If the jump airspeed will be in  excess  of  150  KCAS,  advise  the  parachutists  of  the  airspeed  and  altitude.    Order evacuation of the aircraft by giving the pre-briefed bailout emergency signals. 17.18.16.2.2.  When conditions are not acceptable for parachutists bailout or a drop is aborted for other reasons, the following procedures apply: 17.18.16.2.2.1.  The  red  light  will  be  turned  "ON"  and  will  remain  on  until  exit doors are closed.  (T-2) 17.18.16.2.2.2.  The  PF  will  advise  the  loadmaster,  who  in  turn  will  advise  the jumpmaster  to  have  the  parachutists  unhook,  take  their  seats,  and  fasten  safety belts.  (T-2) 17.18.17.  Container  Delivery  System  (CDS).    Container  delivery  system  is  designed  to airdrop  A-7A,  A-21,  A-22,  Stretch  A-22,  Double  A-22,  and  LCADS  containers  and  loads rigged  on  combat  expendable  platforms.    The  weight  of  each  container  and  type  parachute used should be IAW TO 13C7-1-11 Field Manual 10-501 and USSOCOM 350-series rigging manuals. 17.18.17.1.  CDS  rigging  procedures.    Utilize  rigging  procedures  outlined  in  TO1C-130(M)J-9.    The  following  describes  the  types  of  CDS  releases  that  may  be  used  on AFSOC MC-130J aircraft. 17.18.17.2.  Normal  System  Release.    A  normal  system  release  utilizes  the  static  line retriever and guillotine knife to cut/release the CDS gate.  When using this method, the loadmaster  may  assist  the  release  by  pulling  down  sharply  on  the  static  line  retriever winch cable. 17.18.17.3.  Manual Gate Cut.  A manual gate cut is defined as using a knife or V blade type  knife  to  cut/release  the  CDS  gate  for  all  container  loads.    Loads  rigged  with  type XXVI/VIII nylon may be manually cut using these procedures. 17.18.18.  CDS/CRRC/RAMZ  Specific  Procedures:          WARNING:    The  aircraft  tends  to pitch up as the load exits the aircraft.  This pitch must be anticipated and controlled to allow no more than 2 or 3° additional pitch.  Do not over control to the point that negative G forces are encountered.  (T-2) 17.18.18.1.  Escape.    Departing  the  DZ,  set  flaps  to  50  percent,  accelerate  to  en  route airspeed,  climb  or  descend  as  briefed,  and  perform  the  completion  of  drop  checklist.  Flaps may be called up at the discretion of the PF in lieu of going to 50 percent. 17.18.18.2.  Combat  Rubber  Raiding  Craft  Drop.    CRRCs  may  be  dropped  in  a  stacked configuration  allowing  up  to  four  CRRCs  to  be  dropped  on  a  single  pass.    One  CRRC AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   189  platform  can  be  dropped  using  the  standard  CDS  or  CRS  checklist.    When  two  CRRC platforms  are  dropped  on  a  single  pass,  use  the  CDS  checklist.    Two  CRRC  platforms with up to 18 personnel or one CRRC platform with up to 19 personnel can be airdropped on  one  pass.    Rigged  IAW  TO 13C7-51-21.    If  aircraft  gross  weight  exceeds  120,000 pounds, use 140 KCAS CDS/CRS flap setting chart.  Exception:  For combination drops use 130 KCAS and 130 KCAS flap setting chart. 17.18.18.2.1.  Emergency Procedures.  Use CDS airdrop emergency procedures. 17.18.18.2.2.  Training and Exercises.  One or more recovery boats will be in position to  recover  platforms,  parachutes,  and  personnel.    The  boat  should  be  displaced  400 yards or more from the DZ axis.  The CSO or PM can confirm the release point and offset distance visually or by using radar returns.  (T-2) 17.18.18.2.3.  DZ Axis.   Unless  requested different  by the user, the  DZ  axis  will be into  the  drop  altitude  wind  (±  30°)  when  the  wind  is  5  knots  or  greater.    The jumpmaster will be advised if this cannot be done.  (T-2) 17.18.18.2.4.  Backup  Drop  Platform.    The  raiding  party  exits  when  the  pilot  chute deploys.  In operational employments, a second platform may be carried as a backup in  case  the  main  chute  fails  following  pilot  chute  deployment.    Backup  platform release  point  and  aircrew  or  raiding  party  communication  and  procedures  will  be coordinated prior to the mission.  Procedures and tactics will also be coordinated for airdrop of a second platform and party, if applicable.  (T-2) 17.18.18.2.5.  The following will apply when dropping two CRRCs on one pass: (T-2) 17.18.18.2.5.1.  The forward release gate must be manually cut by the loadmaster.  (T-2) 17.18.18.2.5.2.  The second loadmaster must be positioned in  the paratroop door prior to completion of the ten-minute warning.  (T-2) 17.18.18.2.5.3.  NVGs are required for the airdrop of two CRRCs on one pass at night. 17.18.18.3.  Rigging Alternate Method Zodiac.  The RAMZ consists of a deflated Zodiac F470  combat  rubber  raiding  craft.    The  RAMZ  engine  is  configured  in  a  plywood  box and secured in a standard A-22 container using two T-10 parachutes.  When rigged, the RAMZ package weighs between 600 and 1,000 pounds. 17.18.18.3.1.  Emergency Procedures.  Follow either the CDS emergency procedures or fouled parachutist procedures. 17.18.18.3.2.  Aircraft  Preparation.    Aircraft  preparation  will  be  in  accordance  with TO 1C130(M)J9.    The  RAMZ  package  will  be  delivered  rigged  and  prepared  for loading.    The  loadmaster  is  responsible  for  aircraft  rigging,  attaching  the  static  line, and  securing  the  package.    When  the  bundle  is  used  in  conjunction  with  SAR operations,  it  is  not  uncommon  for  the  STS  or  PJ  team  to  require  the  flexibility  to determine  method  of  deployment  (static  line  or  MFF)  after  they  determine  weather conditions at the recovery site.  In this case, the loadmaster should prepare the aircraft to allow for either option and complete all bundle rigging with the exception of static   190  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 line  attachment.    In-flight  prior  to  the  20  minute  warning,  the  team  along  with  the crew  will  determine  the  method  of  deployment.    At  this  point,  the  loadmaster  will attach  the  anchor  cable  to  the  appropriate  static  line  and  comply  with  Paragraph 17.18.5.8  (In-flight  Rigging  Procedures).    The  package  is  rigged  and  dropped  using normal  CDS  combination  procedures,  or  rigged  on  the  ramp  using  ramp  bundle procedures.  (T-2) 17.18.18.3.3.  Deployment.    Checklist  items  up  to  and  including  the  six-minute advisory  may  be  accomplished  prior  to  identifying  the  target.    Accomplish  the slowdown using normal slowdown procedures. 17.18.18.3.4.  DZ Axis. If possible, the DZ axis will be into the wind (± 30°) for MFF drops  if  drop  altitude  wind  is  5  knots  or  greater.    The  jumpmaster  will  be  advised when this cannot be complied with.  Release for static line deployments can be either into  the  wind  or  downwind.    (T2)        WARNING:    MFF  jumpers  will  not  exit  until RAMZ static lines have been retrieved.  (T-2) 17.18.18.3.5.  Release Point.  The CSO determines the release point.  If the bundle is rigged  using  ramp  bundle  procedures  the  loadmaster  will  manually  cut  the  RAMZ bundle loose which will signal the jumpers they are clear to jump.  MFF jumpers will exit  approximately  6  seconds  after  load  release.    Static  line  jumpers  will  exit immediately after the load release.  (T-2) 17.18.19.  Heavy  Equipment  (HE)  Drops.    Only  equipment  rigged  in  accordance  with TO 13C71-5,  Airdrop  of  Supplies  and  Equipment:    Rigging  Airdrop  Platforms,  and Field Manual  10-500  series  or  USSOCOM  350-series  rigging  manuals  will  be  airdropped.  Nonstandard  equipment  and instructions  and  waivers  from HQ AFSOC/A3V prior to airdrop.  (T-2) loads  require  specific 17.18.20.  Door Bundle.  A7A or A-21 containers weighing up to 500 pounds are referred to as door bundles and may be dropped through the paratroop door or ramp and door using the personnel airdrop checklist.  Door bundles may be dropped independently or in conjunction with  personnel.    Bundle  airdrops  are  limited  to  one  bundle  per  paratroop  door.    When dropped with personnel, the bundle will be the first object to exit the aircraft.  The maximum bundle size in inches is 66 (height) x 48 (width) x 30 (length) for paratroop door loads.  JAI is not required for door bundles.  (T-2) 17.18.20.1.  Paratroop  Doors  (Personnel  Checklist).    Remove  restraint  and  position  the bundle  in  the  paratroop  doors  prior  to  completion  of  the  slowdown  checklist.    Ensure door bundles are not equipped with breakaway static lines. 17.18.20.2.  Ramp Bundle (Personnel Checklist).  Door bundles dropped off the ramp and door  will  be  equipped  with  breakaway  static  lines  in  accordance  with  TO  13C7-1-11, Airdrop  of  Supplies  and Equipment:    Rigging  Containers, or with  parachutes packed in T-10  bags.    Door  bundles  dropped  from  the  ramp  and  door  that  exceed  the  weight  or dimensions  specified  in  Paragraph  17.18.20  will  be  equipped  with  a  skid  board compatible with the intermediate roller conveyors.  (T-2) 17.18.20.3.  Container Ramp Load (Personnel/CDS Checklist).  Load dimensions will be in accordance with above referenced directives.  The total rigged weight of the load will not  exceed 2,335 lbs.   Ramp  bundles will be rigged in  accordance with  TO 13C7-1-11, AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   191  Field Manual  10500, and USSOCOM 350-series directives and dropped  as on-the-ramp loads.    Remove  vertical  and  aft  restraint  at  the  10-minute  warning.    Remove  forward restraint prior to the completion of the slowdown checklist.  The loads will be released by the  loadmaster  and  may  be  followed  by  parachutists.    These  procedures  can  be accomplished  from  either  side  of  the  cargo  ramp  or  from  centerline.    Specific  aircraft preparations and rigging procedures are contained in TO 1C130(M)J-9.  (T-2) 17.18.20.4.  Release  Point.    When  door/ramp  bundles  are  dropped  with  personnel, compute a personnel CARP.  Compute an additional CARP for the door bundle and plot the  vectors  from  the  personnel  release  point  to  ensure  it  will  impact  within  the  DZ boundaries.    Release  the  bundle  at  the  personnel  CARP,  followed  by  the  parachutists when the door is clear.  An alternate procedure is to add the exit time of the bundle to the personnel  CARP,  and  release  the  bundle  at  this  point,  followed  by  the  jumpers.    If  this method  is  used,  the  crew  must  coordinate  with  the  user  to  ensure  the  load  lands  at  the desired location.  When a door bundle is the only object being dropped, base the release on the CARP for the bundle.  (T-2) 17.18.20.5.  Only equipment rigged in accordance with TO13C7-series and Field Manual 10-500 series or USSOCOM 350-series rigging manuals, properly marked with accurate weights and shipper’s declarations will be airdropped.  Nonstandard equipment and loads require specific instructions and waivers from HQ AFSOC/A3V prior to airdrop.  (T-2) 17.18.21.  Joint Precision Airdrop System (JPADS) Procedures. 17.18.21.1.  The term JPADS refers to GPS-guided equipment, I-CDS and MFF airdrops that are planned using the Consolidated Airdrop Tool (CAT). 17.18.21.2.  JPADS  Restrictions.    Wind  data  derived  from  the  JPADS  four  dimensional wind  model  is  suitable  for  mission  use,  but  the  CAT  does  not  calculate  MFF  HARP correctly.  AFSOC crews will not use CAT as the sole source for personnel MFF HARP calculations  until  authorized.    Aircrews  will  use  sound  judgment  and  evaluate  the dropsonde  derived  winds,  forecasted  winds,  and  preflight  HARP  location  before conducting MFF operations.  (T-2) 17.18.21.3.  JPADS certified aircrews are authorized to use the CAT laptop and software (a stand-alone system) to calculate release points for JPADS operations. 17.18.21.3.1.  MFF airdrops only, aircrews can input dropsonde collected winds into onboard airdrop systems, utilize the Air Force Weather Agency forecast/model during mission planning, and incorporate dropsonde collected winds when calculating HARP in AFSOC-approved airdrop planning software for personnel. 17.18.21.3.2.  The  collected  winds  may  be  entered  into  the  wind/temperature summary layer for use in HARP calculation.      Note:  JPADS winds are collected in magnetic  or  true  so  winds  may  require  conversion  to  true  before  entry  into  mission computers. 17.18.21.3.3.  For  JPADS-certified  crews,  Low  Cost  Aerial  Delivery  System (LCADS)-high velocity (HV) is currently included in the CAT.  When using the CAT to compute and I-CDS release point and utilizing LCADS-HV parachutes, ensure the chute system selected is “LCADSHV.”   192  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 17.18.21.4.  JPADS  certified  crews  are  authorized  JPADS  airdrop  operations  in  VMC and  IMC  above  3,000  feet  AGL  without  the  use  of  a  Radar  Beacon  or  Ground  Radar Aerial Delivery System (GRADS). 17.18.21.5.  Drop zone size criteria during contingency operations are at the discretion of the user.  Ultimately, the user accepts responsibility for the accuracy and the condition of these airdrop loads. 17.18.21.6.  The  planned  release  point  for  actual  JPADS  training  airdrops  must  be executed within the lateral  and vertical  limits  of a restricted area, unless waived by HQ AFSOC/A3.  (T-2) 17.18.21.7.  During the dropsonde release, use of zero flaps at speeds between 170 – 180 KCAS  is  required  to  preclude  dropsonde  tail  strikes.    Loadmasters  should  release  the dropsondes from the corners of the cargo ramp. 17.18.21.8.  Wind Limits.  Wind limitations are unrestricted for dropsonde operations, 18 knots for JPADS 2K and 10K and as published for all other parachutes. 17.18.21.9.  Altitude Restrictions. 17.18.21.9.1.  I-CDS/JPADS:  Maximum altitude 25,000 feet MSL. 17.18.21.9.2.  JPADS 2K and 10K minimum drop altitude is 8,000 feet AGL. 17.18.21.9.3.  JPADS 2K and 10K minimum drop altitude is 3,500 feet AGL. 17.18.21.9.4.  Dropsonde minimum drop altitude is 3,000 feet AGL. 17.18.21.10.  For all training drops the dropsonde will be planned to land in the intended impact/drop  area  using  the  release  point  determined  by  the  JPADS-MP.    The  planned release point will be programmed in the CNI-MU into the mission computer as a normal (non-drop)  leg.    Aircraft  position  will  be  confirmed  either  by  GPS  with  a  FOM  of  3  or better or via aircraft sensor updates.  (T-2) 17.18.21.11.  Equipment  Drops.    CSOs  will  program  the  planned  release  point  into  the mission computer as a normal (non-drop) leg.  Aircraft position will be confirmed either by GPS with  a FOM of  3 or better or via aircraft  sensor updates.  For non-GPS guided drops CSOs will validate the JPADS-MP release point via normal CARP procedures.  (T-2) 17.18.22.  Low  Cost  Aerial  Delivery  System  (LCADS):    The  Low  Cost  Aerial  Delivery System  is  a  one-time  use,  stand-alone  airdrop  system  consisting  of  a  modular  suite  of  low cost airdrop items, and be comprised of parachutes, containers, platforms, and other air items configured for low-velocity, high-velocity, and free-fall drop aerial delivery of loads. 17.18.23.  Low Cost Aerial Delivery System-Low Velocity (LCADS-LV). 17.18.23.1.  LCADS-LV  Ballistics.    LCADS-LV  will  be  dropped  using  the  ballistics IAW AFI 11-231  or  published  Air  Transportation  Test  Loading  Agency  (ATTLA) memorandum.  Exit times will be IAW AFI 11-231 Table 9.19  (T-2) 17.18.23.1.1.  Drop  Zone  Size.    The  drop  zone  size  will  be  IAW  AFI  13-217.    The minimum reliable drop altitude is 1,000 feet AGL (drops below 800 feet AGL pose a significant  risk  of  failure  or  damage).    The  maximum  drop  altitude  is  13,000  feet AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   193  MSL  (drops  above  10,000  feet  MSL  are  restricted  to  a  maximum  of  1,700  lbs suspended weight).  (T-2) 17.18.23.1.2.  Rigging.    Breakaway  static  lines  will  be  used  regardless  of  altitude.  The static line break tie will be full strength type III nylon (550) cord for all LCADS-LV parachutes.  (T-2)   Note:  Use of gutted type III nylon (550) cord will result in chute  deployment  failure.    Joint  airdrop  inspectors  will  ensure  proper  static  line configuration, including anti-oscillation ties.  (T2) 17.18.23.2.  Low Cost Aerial Delivery System-High Velocity (LCADS-HV). 17.18.23.2.1.  LCADS-HV  is  not  authorized  for  training  use.    LCADS-HV  is authorized  for  contingency  missions  and  developmental/Developmental  Test  and Evaluation/(OT&E) missions. 17.18.23.2.2.  LCADS-HV  Parachutes  are  factory-rigged  in  a  breakaway  static  line configuration and must always be rigged for breakaway on the aircraft regardless of drop  altitude.    Failure  to  use  breakaway  will  result  in  damage  to  the  aircraft.    The static  line  break  tie  will  be  gutted  Type  III  nylon  (550)  cord  for  all  LCADS-HV parachutes.    Joint  airdrop  inspectors  will  be  vigilant  and  ensure  proper  static  line configuration, including anti-oscillation ties.  (T-2) 17.18.23.3.  Low Cost Aerial Delivery System-Low-Altitude (LCLA). 17.18.23.3.1.  LCLA  is  one  of  the  Army's  low  cost  airdrop  systems.    LCLA  was designed  to  provide  very  low-altitude  aerial  resupply  using  small  fixed-wing  and rotary-wing aircraft. 17.18.23.3.2.  LCLA  parachutes  are  compatible  with  A-7A    and  A-21  containers.  Containers  may  be  rigged  with  a  single  parachute  or  with  clusters  of  up  to  three parachutes.  LCLA parachutes will be rigged with non-breakaway static lines.  (T-2) 17.18.23.3.3.  All  AFSOC C-130 variants  will conduct  LCLA airdrops at  130 KIAS using personnel/container ramp load checklist procedures.  EXCEPTIONS:  1.  Use 50 percent flaps for all LCLA drops.  2.  Position anchor cable stops at FS 803.  (T-2) 17.18.23.3.4.  LCLA drop altitude will be no lower than 150 feet AGL.  For airdrops below  approved  en  route  low-level  altitudes,  descent  to  drop  altitude  will  begin  no earlier  than  the  IP.    Situation  permitting,  notify  the  user  if  airdropping  above  the expected LCLA altitude range (150-300 feet AGL).  (T-2) 17.19.  Formation Procedures. 17.19.1.  General.    Formation  is  used  to  get  mass  to  an  objective/target    and  facilitates escort/safe  passage  requirements.    The  need  to  get  mass  to  an  objective/target  must  be calculated  against  putting  multiple  aircraft  in  close  proximity  to  each  other.    If  the  mission necessitates flying low level to deliver mass at an objective/target in minimum time, consider flying independent routes prior to the objective/target area.  (T-2) 17.19.1.1.  These procedures are primarily designed to be used in VMC.  IMC procedures may be employed in extraordinary circumstances when IMC is encountered inadvertently or when the mission demands that IMC must be penetrated.  During training in an ATC environment,  accomplish  IMC  formation  IAW  FAA  or  host  nation  procedures.    (T-2)      194  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 WARNING:    Operation  under  VFR  clearance  in  IMC  conditions  is  an  emergency procedure  during  training  and  exercise  operations,  requiring  appropriate  IFF  and  radio calls to the area air traffic control agency.  During contingency or combat missions, the necessity  of  flying  “comm-  out”  in  IMC  must  be  weighed  against  terrain  clearance capability and the increased mid-air potential.  (T-2) 17.19.2.  Ground operations.  Minimum taxi interval is one aircraft length. 17.19.3.  Takeoff.    Minimum  takeoff  interval  is  15  seconds.    For  simultaneous  departures, aircraft separation must be at least 3,000 feet between aircraft.  Lead must have at least 3,500 feet of useable runway for takeoff.  Minimum visibility for formation takeoff is 1 mile (RVR 50). 17.19.4.  Rejoins.    Aircraft  joining  a  formation  en  route  will  rejoin  as  briefed  to  en  route position. Remain at least 500 feet above or below the formation until the formation is in sight and clearance to rejoin is granted.  (T-2) 17.19.5.  En Route Procedures. 17.19.5.1.  En  route  formation  will  not  normally  be  flown.    Additionally,  degraded systems  (Table  17.1)  operations  or  DST  will  not  normally  drive  the  use  of  en  route formation.    Only  when  the  tactical  situation  requires,  and  there  is  no  other  way  to accomplish  the  mission  tasking,  visual  en  route  formation  position  will  be  500  -  6,000 feet  between  aircraft  utilizing  fluid  trail  geometry.    The  visual  primary  formation employment  method  will  be  single-ship  ingress  with  a  rejoin  at  the  pre-initial  point  for the  objective  area,  followed  by  single-ship  egress.    (IMC  formation  spacing  will  be  no closer  than  6,000’.    Formation  spacing  minimums  for  airdrop  operations  are  IAW Paragraph  17.19.6.1  of  this  instruction;  formation  spacing  minimums  for  refueling operations are IAW ATP-56B, once past the Pre-IP.)  (T-2) 17.19.5.2.  At night or in IMC, lead will announce unplanned airspeed changes of greater than 15 knots, unless briefed otherwise.  (T-2) 17.19.5.3.  Aircraft  aborting  after  assembly  will  notify  lead  and  turn  away  from formation.  The aborted aircraft will either rejoin at the end of the formation or proceed to a suitable recovery field.  Aircraft within a flight will reposition as briefed.  (T-2) 17.19.6.  Formation Objective Area Procedures. 17.19.6.1.  VMC  Airdrop  Spacing.    MC-130  crews  are  authorized  to  conduct  all  high-speed and 50% flap airdrops in visual formation.  Minimum spacing for visual formation airdrop  is  2,000  feet  (Exception:    MCADS  minimum  spacing  is  500  feet).    Minimum spacing for reduced flap setting drops (e.g., CDS and CRS) is 6,000 feet between aircraft.  Waiver authority for reduced airdrop spacing is the Group Commander or COMAFSOF. 17.19.6.2.  IMC  Airdrop  Spacing.    Minimum  spacing  for  formation  IMC  airdrops  is 6,000 feet. 17.19.6.3.  Formation Airdrop Altitude Separation.  Subsequent aircraft will select a drop altitude at least 50 feet above the preceding aircraft.  (T-2) 17.19.7.  Landings.  For 50% flap minimum interval landings, the desired landing interval is 20 seconds;  minimum  landing  interval  is  15  seconds.    For  100%  flap  minimum  interval AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   195  landings, the desired landing interval is 30 seconds, minimum landing interval is 20 seconds.  Consider  extending  these  intervals  for  strong  crosswinds,  narrow/short  runways,  or  other adverse conditions.  For simultaneous landings, planned touchdown point separation will be 3,000  feet  minimum  using  100  percent  flaps.    Consider  extending  the  landing  interval  for excessive  wind  conditions  or  wet/slippery  runway  conditions.   A  combination  of simultaneous and min-interval landings may be planned.  Unless otherwise briefed, for other than  simultaneous  landings,  bring  throttles  into  the  ground  range  at  3,000  feet  remaining, brakes and reverse at 2,000 feet remaining. For simultaneous landings, followers will slow to a  safe  taxi  speed  prior  to  the  preceding  aircraft's  touchdown  point.    Minimum  spacing between simultaneous landing elements is 90 seconds.  Use 30 seconds minimum spacing for a minimum interval element following a simultaneous element.  Touch-and-go landings out of formation  recoveries  are prohibited.  Minimum  visibility for formation landing is  1 mile (RVR 50).  (T-2) 17.19.8.  Dissimilar Formations.  All AFSOC C-130 variants are authorized to fly formation with  other  AFSOC  C-130  aircraft  when  mission  requirements  dictate.    500  feet  lateral separation is the minimum spacing for different MDS aircraft.  This is IAW with all AFSOC fixed-wing aircraft procedures.  For formation HAAR/TAAR, use geometries, positions and lost contact procedures described in ATP 56B, Air-to-Air Refueling, Part 3/4.  For formation AAR use geometries and positions described in ATP 56B. 17.19.9.  Command  and  Control.    Clear  lines  of  command  must  be  established  during formation flight.  Personnel in the following roles will be identified during mission planning and will be annotated on the flight orders (unless noted otherwise): (T-2) 17.19.9.1.  Air  Mission  Commander  (AMC)  and  Deputy  Mission  Commander  (DMC).  For AMC and DMC formation duties see Paragraphs 2.8 and 2.9. 17.19.9.2.  Formation  Commander.    Required  on  every  formation  mission.    The designated commander of a formation of aircraft is responsible for successful completion of the formation's portion of the mission and is chosen from the PICs, or CSOs, involved in  the  mission.    The  formation  commander  works  closely  with  the  AMC  (if  one  is utilized)  to  accomplish  the  overall  mission  and  is  usually  designated  DMC  in  missions employing a dedicated AMC. 17.19.9.3.  Formation  Lead.    The  lead  aircraft  in  a  formation  flight  is  responsible  for proper mission execution and other immediate action events during a formation flight. 17.19.10.  Dissimilar Formation Briefings.  A face-to-face briefing between all involved crew members is highly desired.  As a minimum, dissimilar formation briefings must be attended by  all  PICs  and  the  CSO  from  each  crew.    When  geographic  separation  between  units precludes a face-to-face briefing, the AMC will coordinate directly with each PIC to ensure each crew receives all appropriate formation and mission information prior to their individual crew briefings.  At a minimum, brief the following items: (T-2) 17.19.10.1.  Communications.    Air-to-air  TACAN  assignments,  aircraft  lighting,  power settings (differences between E/H/P and J), speeds, inadvertent weather penetration, and formation geometry.      Note:  Inadvertent weather penetration speeds for MC-130E/H/P range from 160180 KIAS/KCAS.  Consider using slower speeds (180, 170, 160 KCAS)   196  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 during  dissimilar  formations  due  to  aircraft  performance  and  limitations.    Inadvertent weather penetration speeds will be agreed upon and briefed prior to flight.  (T-2) 17.19.11.  Inadvertent  Weather  Penetration.    Upon  entering  marginal  VMC  or  IMC,  the following  procedures  apply:            WARNING:    Inadvertent  weather  penetration  procedures must  be  briefed.    These  procedures  are  designed  for  use  from  visual  trail  formation  during straight  and  level  flight  with  no  more  than  3  aircraft.    It  may  be  necessary  to  modify  these procedures  due  to  formation  geometries,  terrain,  airspace  restrictions,  etc.    Inadvertent weather penetration in  mountainous terrain  may be extremely hazardous.  Mission planners must devise and brief procedures that best suit the situation.  (T-2)        Note:  Inadvertent weather  penetration  procedures  are  for  emergency  use  and  do  not  constitute  authority  to violate  AFI  11-202,  Vol  3,  or  Federal  Aviation  Regulations.    Exercising  these  procedures under actual weather conditions is a violation subject to appropriate action by the Air Force and  FAA.    Individual  aircraft  should  maintain  VFR  if  there  is  sufficient  warning  to  take evasive  action.    Flight  leads  will  take  all  practical  measures  to  avoid  entering  controlled airspace without clearance.  (T-2) 17.19.11.1.  Wing  aircraft  immediately  initiates  a  climbing  turn  as  required  for  its position  in  the  formation  and  gives  "Call  Sign”  then  “IMC  Break"  three  times  over  the primary  interplane  radio.    The  lead  aircraft  responds  with  call  sign,  heading,  and  base altitude.  Base altitude will be as follows:  MSA, if position is within the MSA corridor; or ESA, if not.  (T-2)     Note:  During training and exercise operations, the IMC Break call  will  be  made  on  a  non-secure  radio.    Lead’s  response  will  be  made  on  the  same nonsecure radio by the CSO (unless briefed otherwise), and the response should be called twice to ensure all wingmen copied the heading and altitude.  (T-2) 17.19.11.2.  All aircraft turn navigation lights to bright and turn transponder modes 1 and 3 to normal (if the threat environment allows). 17.19.11.3.  Lead  aircraft  uses  power  as  required  and  climbs  straight  ahead  at  a  base airspeed of 220 KCAS until reaching base altitude or VMC conditions, whichever occurs first.  Upon reaching this altitude, maintain base airspeed of 220 KCAS.  If lead is unable to  climb  at  220 KCAS,  the  aircraft  commander  will  establish  a  new  base  airspeed  and inform the formation over interplane frequency.  (T-2) 17.19.11.4.  The #2 aircraft immediately turns right 10° or more (if feasible), sets power as required and climbs at base airspeed minus 20 KCAS to base altitude plus 500 feet or VMC  conditions,  whichever  occurs  first.    After  30  seconds,  resume  original  heading.  Upon reaching altitude, accelerate to base airspeed. 17.19.11.5.  The #3 aircraft immediately turns left 10° or more (if feasible), sets power as required and climbs at base airspeed minus 40 KCAS to base altitude plus 1,000 feet or VMC  conditions,  whichever  occurs  first.    After  30  seconds,  resume  original  heading.  Upon reaching altitude, accelerate to base airspeed. 17.19.11.6.  If  VMC  conditions  are  encountered  and  can  be  maintained,  rejoin  the formation visually after obtaining permission from Lead.        WARNING:  The direction of turn for IMC breaks is based on a “no terrain” situation.  Terrain, threats, or fluid trail position may dictate a direction of turn different from what your formation position calls for.    Situational  awareness  is  critical  to  terrain  and  threat  avoidance  when  weather  is AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   197  inadvertently encountered.       Note:  If the altitude to which the formation is climbing is only several hundred feet above en route altitude, a less aggressive climb profile (Vertical Velocity  Indicator)  may  be  appropriate.    Remember,  the  climbing  turn  and  speed differential are what get the desired separation and the amount of power set gives you the desired climb away from terrain.      Note:  All IMC maneuvering should be smooth and deliberate with reference to flight instruments to prevent spatial disorientation. 17.19.12.  Preplanned Weather Penetration.  These procedures enable weather penetration en route to a VMC objective area.  They are designed to transition a formation from visual trail to Radar Trail prior to entering weather and permit continued formation flight in IMC.  Using these  procedures,  it  is  possible  to  fly  an  IMC  route  segment  at  a  preplanned  safe  altitude while still maintaining formation integrity. 17.19.12.1.  On lead’s signal, lead accelerates 20 KCAS, #2 maintains en route airspeed, and #3 reduces speed 20 KCAS.  The formation maintains this airspeed differential for 3 minutes,  then  resumes  en  route  airspeed.    This  should  establish  approximately  1  mile separation between aircraft.  On the same signal, lead maintains/climbs to base altitude, #2 climbs at 1,000 feet per minute to base altitude plus 500, and #3 climbs at 1,000 feet per  minute  to  base  altitude  plus  1,000  feet.    Base  altitude  will  be  as  follows:    MSA,  if position  is  within  the  MSA  corridor;  ESA  if  outside  the  corridor,  or  an  appropriate  en route  altitude  if  outside  the  low-level  environment.    Depending  on  the  environment, altitudes may be amended (i.e., base plus 100 feet, base plus 200 feet or all aircraft at co-altitude).    (T-2)            Note:    Radar  Trail  requires  the  lead  aircraft  to  report  all  heading, altitude,  and  airspeed  changes  on  interplane  radio  when  operating  in  a  permissive environment  or  requires  these  changes  be  thoroughly  preplanned  and  flown  precisely when operating in a hostile, comm-out environment. 17.19.13.  Assembly.  The formation commander will brief how rejoins and position changes are to be accomplished in the VFR pattern.  If multiple formation recoveries are planned for the VFR pattern, it may  be preferable to  brief that  rejoins in the pattern are directly to  trail and for wingmen to call “in” when in position.  (T-2) 17.19.14.  Lead Considerations: 17.19.14.1.  During visual trail formation, wingmen maintain position strictly by a visual reference  to  the  preceding  aircraft.    Because  of  this,  it  is  essential  that  lead  maintain  a stable reference platform by  flying  constant  power settings  as much as possible.  Small climbs should be made by changing pitch and leaving power set.  For climbs in excess of 500  feet,  set  power  and  adjust  pitch  as  necessary  to  avoid  obstacles.    For  descents  in excess  of  500  feet,  set  power  not  less  than  approximately  1,000  HP  (approximately  1.5 knob width)  and adjust pitch to maintain the desired airspeed or rate of descent.  Under normal  circumstances,  lead  should  avoid  using  flight  idle  or  maximum  power  settings, since  they  may  outperform  the  ability  of  the  wing  aircraft.    Power  Lever  movement should be smooth and relatively slow to allow adjustments by wingmen.       WARNING:  Pilots  must  keep  in  mind  the  risks  of  overrunning  the  lead  aircraft.    Use  all  means  to notify Lead of an overrun situation in order to avoid a collision.  (T-2) 17.19.14.2.  During  fluid trail formation,  climbs  and descents  should be  made much the same as visual trail.  Small climbs should be made by changing pitch and leaving power set.    For  climbs  in  excess  of  500  feet,  set  power  and  adjust  pitch  as  necessary  to  avoid   198  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 obstacles.    Lead  should  use  climb  power  minus  one  knob  width  to  give  wing  aircraft  a power  advantage.    For  descents  in  excess  of  500  feet,  set  power  not  less  than approximately 1,000  HP  (1.5 knob) and adjust pitch to  maintain the desired airspeed or rate of descent.  Like visual trail, lead should be smooth with power changes; however, a greater range of high and low settings are available due to the spacing of the aircraft.  The formation  commander may brief alternate rates and power settings  for fluid  trail climbs and descents. 17.19.15.  Aircraft Lighting: 17.19.15.1.  Departure  and  Recovery.    Normal  or  reduced  lighting  is  authorized  IAW AFI 11202, Vol 3. 17.19.15.2.  En  route.    In  the  ATC  environment,  during  other  than  actual  combat operations, all aircraft not in a standard formation (standard formation is defined as less than 1 mile horizontal separation and less than 100 feet vertical, IAW FAA) will be fully lighted as required by AFI 11202, Vol 3.  (T-2) 17.19.15.3.  Night Vision Goggles (NVGs).  Refer to Table 17.3  for exterior and interior light settings when using NVGs.  The signal to transition to/from NVG lighting will be as briefed.  (T2)   Note:  When other than standard AFI 11-202V3, lighting is required due to mission constraints, Table 17.3  provides a reference for light configurations and light signals to be used during formation and helicopter air refueling operations. Table 17.3.  Lighting Chart  (T-2). 1.  Day Formation.  All aircraft will have lighting IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 3. 2.  Night Formation without NVGs.  All aircraft will have lighting IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 3. 3.  Echelon Formation, Night, Using NVGs: a.  Master Switch - COVERT, Covert/Formation – as required b.  Navigation Lights – OFF c.  Anti-Collision/Strobe Lights – OFF d.  Pod and Hose Illumination Lights – OFF e.  Leading Edge Lights – OFF f.  UARRSI Lights – OFF 4.  Fluid Trail:  Same as item 3 except, spacing and illumination may require higher formation light setting. Note:    For  training  and  exercise  flights  (with  or  without  NVGs),  the  last  aircraft  in  the formation will be lighted IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 3.  At night aircraft may turn off the pod and hose  illumination,  leading  edge,  and  fuselage  lights,  to  aid  night  vision.    During  training  and exercise flights, all aircraft will have lighting IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 3, when not in fluid trail or echelon formation. Note:    Formations  may  vary  lighting  as  necessary  provided  they  maintain  adequate  visual identification of the formation. AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   199  17.19.16.  Lead  Changes.    When  necessary  to  change  formation  lead,  use  the  following procedures:    On  command  of  the  formation  leader,  the  lead  aircraft  will  maintain  airspeed, altitude, and heading.  The #2 aircraft will increase airspeed by approximately 10 KCAS and move  out  to  the  right  side  of  the  formation  (unless  briefed  otherwise)  to  provide  sufficient clearance  while  moving  abeam  of  lead.    When  the  #2  aircraft  passes  and  assumes  lead position, the old lead will be appropriately notified (by verbal or light signal).  The previous #3 aircraft will move out with the new lead to maintain the same relative position.  The old lead falls back to his briefed position.  If it is necessary to switch lead and two, while leaving three in his position, two will move up and to the right and the old lead will slide aft to trail on the new leader.  Three must leave sufficient space for the preceding aircraft to maneuver.  If  this  option  is  used,  it  must  be  briefed,  as  it  is the  exception  to  the  rule.    Using  the  same general procedures, the #3 aircraft can also become the lead by pulling out and ahead of the two  aircraft  in  front.    New  order  would  then  be  #3,  #1,  #2.    The  signal  to  change  these positions should be precise, e.g., “(Call Sign), #2, take lead,” or use appropriate light signal.  During  a  lead  change,  do  not  rejoin  to  the  right  echelon  position.    (T-2)            WARNING:  There is  a natural  tendency to  turn the aircraft in  the direction a pilot  is looking.  During a position  change,  this  causes  a  tendency  for  the  aircraft  to  develop  a  vector  towards  each other.    During  position  changes,  closely  monitor  bank  angle  and  closure  with  the  other aircraft.    Note:  Lead changes should be done on a route segment where no turns or other maneuvers are required.      Note:  If difficulty is encountered in working an IFR clearance for  the  formation,  a  short  term  solution  is  to  get  a  single  IFR  clearance  and  have  the  #2 aircraft stack level at 1 mile in trail.  This only works with a two ship due to the constraints of a standard formation. 17.19.17.  Any  wingman  losing  radar  in  IMC,  (TCAS  is  not  on  or  operational)  should immediately notify the formation commander and turn away from the formation heading (if not  in  a  safe  position)  toward  permissive  terrain.    If  TCAS  is  operational,  the  degraded aircraft may continue in IMC conditions as number two.  If VMC, move to a trail position.  Loss of systems while en route should be thoroughly covered in the formation briefing. 17.20.  Tanker Air-to-Air Refueling.  Conduct IAW TO 1C-130(M)J-1 and ATP-56(B). 17.20.1.  Minimum  Altitudes.    Select  a  refueling  altitude  based  on  the  threat  environment. Minimum  HAAR/TAAR  altitude  is  500  feet  AGL,  without  a  waiver.    Low-altitude HAAR/TAAR training below 1,000 feet AGL will not be conducted at tanker gross weights above 130,000 pounds or without three engine climb capability of at least 500 FPM.  (T-2)   Note:    A  minimum  vertical  separation  of  500  feet  will  be  maintained  when  conducting rendezvous to another C-130 aircraft simulating HAAR/TAAR.  (T-2) 17.20.2.  HAAR Minimum Separation/Ingress.  The receiver join-up altitude will be at least 300 feet  below  the  refueling  altitude  for  all  receiver  low  procedures  and  at  least  200  feet above  the  refueling  altitude  for  all  receiver  high  procedures.    Ingress  should  be  at  AAR altitude.  (T-2) 17.20.3.  TAAR  Minimum  Separation/Ingress.    Prior  to  positive  identification,  a  minimum vertical  separation  of  500  feet  will  be  maintained  between  tanker  and  receiver  during  all rendezvous, except a minimum vertical separation of 1,000 feet will be maintained between tanker  and  receiver  during  tanker  orbit  rendezvous  procedures.    Once  the  receiver  is   200  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 positively  identified,  minimum  vertical  separation  may  be  reduced  to  300  feet.    Ingress should be at rendezvous altitude.  (T-2) 17.20.4.  Minimum  Safe  Altitude  (MSA)  for  HAAR/TAAR.  Heading  and  altitude  must provide at least 1,000 feet of clearance above all obstacles within 5 nm of course to be flown in non-mountainous terrain, 2,000 feet of clearance in mountainous terrain. 17.21.  Receiver Air-to-Air Refueling.  Conduct IAW TO 1C-130(M)J-1 and ATP-56(B). 17.21.1.  Communication.    Unless  directed  otherwise  by  a  specific  exercise  operations order/plan, or during contingencies, communication capability between tankers and receivers will  be  maintained  during  all  normal  rendezvous  and  air  refueling  operations.    Voice transmissions  will  be  IAW  the  emission  control  option  used.    (T-2)      CAUTION:    Air refueling  operations  will  not  be  conducted  when  radio  communications  capability  between the  tanker  and  receiver  is  lost,  except  during  emergency  fuel  situation.    If  radio communications  are  lost,  or  unreadable  between  the  boom  operator  and  receiver  pilot, contacts will not be attempted.  (T-2) 17.21.2.  Use  manual  boom  latching  procedures  only  during  fuel  emergencies  and contingency operations.     Exception:  Manual boom latching procedures are authorized for all  refueling  operations  with  the  KC-10  if  the  tanker's  independent  disconnect  system  is operational. 17.21.3.  Altitude Reservations (ALTRV).  Whenever practical, refueling operations are done on  tracks  or  anchor  areas  published  in  the  DoD  FLIP.    ALTRVs  are  used  when  certain missions  or  operational  considerations  may  require  air  refueling  operations  in  areas  not published in FLIP.  For specific ALTRV procedures, refer to FLIP and FAA Special Military Operations 7610.4H, 3. 17.21.4.  Special Operations Air-to-Air Refueling Procedures.  Refer to AFTTP 3-3.MC-130J and  AFI  11-2KC-135,  Vol  3,  Addenda  C,  KC-135  Special  Operations,  for  specific procedures. AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   201  Chapter 18 LEAFLET AIRDROP 18.1.  General.  Leaflet airdrops are accomplished in both hostile and permissive environments. 18.2.  Mission  Description.  Mission  requirements  vary  widely  depending  on  the  volume  of leaflets  airdropped,  leaflet  packaging,  and  the  altitude  of  the  airdrop.    Loads  will  normally  not exceed  25,000  pounds.    Drop  altitudes  may  vary  from  500  feet  AGL  to  the  aircraft  service ceiling.    Leaflet  drops  require  the  movement  of  boxes  of  various  weights  from  throughout  the cargo  compartment  via  intermediate  rollers  (if  required)  to  the  ramp  area  for  dispersal  off  the ramp.    If  specific  mission  requirements  dictate  deviation  from  information  contained  in  this publication,  modify  procedures  to  meet  specific  requirements.    (T-2)      Note:    All  airdrops conducted  above  FL250  require  a  waiver  to  AFI  11-202,  Vol  3.    Long  duration  high-altitude drops  will  require  the  aircraft  remain  open.    Consider  outside  air  temperature  and  clothing requirements prior to step.  (T-2) 18.3.  Equipment.  In  addition  to  normal  aircraft  equipment,  the  following  items  may  be required to perform leaflet drops: 18.3.1.  Parachutes  or  restraining  harnesses  must  be  available  for  use  by  all  personnel working in the cargo compartment.  (T-2) 18.3.2.  A portable oxygen console with a minimum of four regulators and output hoses with sufficient  length  to  reach  throughout  the  entire  cargo  compartment  must  be  available  for high-altitude airdrops (as required by AFI 11-409).  (T-2) 18.3.3.  An  interval  timer  is  desirable  (alternating  red  and  green  jump  lights  may  serve  for sequencing the drops or as briefed). 18.4.  Aircraft Configuration.  Determine if leaflets are to be floor loaded or are configured on pallets.  Based on how the leaflets are prepared and the volume of leaflets to airdrop, there are several possible configurations. 18.4.1.  Palletized Loads.  Preload large volumes of leaflets on pallets and load as palletized cargo.    Resources  permitting,  this  is  the  recommended  procedure  for  large  volumes  of leaflets. 18.4.1.1.  Use modified pallets with warehouse rollers attached to the top of the pallets in two sticks. 18.4.1.2.  Stack  the  leaflet  boxes  on  the  pallets  in  two  sticks  and  secure  them  to  the pallets before loading aircraft. 18.4.1.3.  In addition to the modified pallets, provide a bridge to span the gap between the last floor pallet and the ramp pallet. 18.4.1.3.1.  Construct the bridge so the rollers on it are the same height as the rollers on top of the pallets when loaded in the ECHS. 18.4.1.3.2.  Install  the  bridge  after  the  ramp  is  lowered  to  the  airdrop  position  and before completion of the Slowdown/Three-minute checklist.   202  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 18.4.2.  Floor  Loads.    Leaflets  may  also  be  loaded  directly  on  the  aircraft  intermediate conveyors,  if  available.    Employ  this  procedure  for  smaller  loads  of  leaflets  or  when  the equipment mentioned above is not available. 18.4.2.1.  Individual boxes have to be hand loaded and each group of boxes individually secured using aircraft tie-down equipment. 18.4.2.2.  Configure the aircraft IAW AFI 11-2MC-130J, Vol 3, Addenda A. 18.4.2.2.1.  Install the HSLLADS rollers if the size of the leaflet boxes permit. 18.4.2.2.2.  If the HSLLADS rollers are not available the boxes may not roll or may be damaged if loaded on only one roller conveyor.  Consider using CDS skid boards or sheets of plywood as skids under the leaflet boxes. 18.4.2.2.2.1.  If  using  this  option,  secure  each  skid  of  leaflets  individually  using aircraft tie-down equipment. 18.4.2.2.2.2.  Drift each skid back to the ramp hinge during the airdrop, exercising caution not to let the skid board exit the aircraft. 18.4.2.2.2.3.  Secure  the  empty  skids  against  the  side  wall  until  the  airdrop  is completed. 18.5.  Preparation  for  Loading.  Complete  applicable  portions  of  the  appropriate  TO1C-130(M)J-9 checklists as follows: 18.5.1.  Cargo Loading Preparation. 18.5.2.  Cargo Loading (Palletized/Floor Load/Winching Vehicle). 18.5.3.  Airplane Preparation for Container Delivery System (CDS) Airdrop. 18.5.4.  Anchor Cables.  Rig one anchor cable on each side of the aircraft. 18.5.4.1.  Attach the aft latch of each anchor cable to the inboard U-bolt on the aft anchor cable support on each side of the airplane. 18.5.4.2.  Position  the anchor cable stops to  the very forward or  aft end of the cable, or remove and stow the stops, unless they are used as stops for the restraint harness restraint strap. 18.5.4.3.  Attach  the  forward  latch  to  the  center  U-bolts  on  the  forward  anchor  cable support. 18.5.4.3.1.  If the center U-bolts are not  accessible because of aircraft configuration, attach the forward latch to the outboard U-bolts. 18.5.4.3.2.  If  connecting  the  forward  latch  to  the  outboard  U-bolts,  leave  additional slack in the cable to allow anchor cable installation in the outboard location on the A-frame during the airdrop. 18.5.4.3.3.  Lower  the  center  anchor  cable  supports  and  lock  them  in  the  vertical position with  the tubular supports.  Do not  connect  the anchor  cable to  the A-frame during  rigging.    The  cable  may  block  the  cargo  door  from  properly  opening  and closing. AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   203  18.5.4.3.4.  The  aft  anchor  cable  support  arm  micro  switches  should  be  isolated  so that the cargo ramp will operate with the anchor cables lowered.  (T-2) 18.5.4.3.4.1.  Isolate  the  aft  anchor  cable  support  arm  micro  switches  by  pulling ECB 834  (L ANCHOR LINE ARM) and ECB 835 (R ANCHOR LINE ARM). 18.5.5.  Static  line  Retrievers.    Suspend  oxygen  hoses  from  static  line  retriever  cables  for high-altitude missions (as required). 18.5.5.1.  Unwind static line retriever cable(s). 18.5.5.2.  Install quick disconnects on the aft end of cable(s). 18.5.5.3.  Secure the quick disconnects to the inboard side of the A-frame with two turns of  1/4  inch  cotton  webbing.    Make  this  tie  approximately  18  inches  above  the  anchor cable  attaching  point.    If  the  static  line  retriever  is  inadvertently  rewound,  the  tie  will break and will prevent damage to the A-frame or static line retriever.  (T-2) 18.5.5.4.  Remove all slack from static line retriever cables. 18.5.6.  Oxygen  Hoses  and  Interphone  Cord.    Tape  or  tie  extended  oxygen  hoses  and interphone  cords  together  and  suspend  from  static  line  retriever  cables  with  G-13  clevis  or suitable substitute. 18.5.6.1.  Ensure that approximately 12 G-13 clevises or suitable substitutes are available to tie oxygen hoses to the static line retriever cable(s). 18.5.6.2.  Recommend the kicker use the oxygen regulator and interphone cord aft of the left paratroop door.  Route the cord and hose up and over the overhead structural beams, and  back  down  next  to  the  overhead  ADS  release.    This  technique  keeps  the  hose  and cord off the floor preventing them from  becoming tangled or  damaged.   It also  keeps it out of the kicker's way while kicking boxes and retrieving static lines. 18.6.  Securing Boxes.  Secure five boxes on the ramp for airdrop.  If loading preloaded pallets, two sticks of five boxes each, are secured on the ramp pallet. 18.7.  Connecting Static Lines.  Connect static lines to the anchor cable aft of the A-frame. 18.8.  Restraint  Strapping.  Place a single length of Type III nylon, as final restraint, over the stick of boxes.  The cargo restraint strap over the boxes on the ramp is removed at the 1-minute warning.  The Type III nylon final restraint is cut at the release point.   204  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 Figure 18.1.  Leaflet Box Rigging Procedures. 18.9.  Leaflet  Box  Rigging  Procedures.  Rigging  boxes dissemination. for  high-altitude  static line  18.9.1.  Using a punch, cut four holes approximately 2 1/2 inches by 3/4 inches as indicated in Figure  21.1.   If a punch is not available, a knife can be used.  When using a punch, the box  must  first  be  placed  upon  an  object  slightly  deeper  and  smaller  than  the  box  so  that  a hard-surface is provided when striking the punch.  (T-2) 18.9.2.  Cut through the box from one hole to another as illustrated in Figure 18.1. 18.9.3.  Place  a  2-inch  wide  length  of  webbing  through  the  holes.    The  length  of  webbing depends upon the size of the box, but must be long enough to tie after the box has been filled with leaflets.  (T-2) 18.9.4.  Place a 3- or 4-inch strip of masking tape over the 2-inch wide webbing. 18.9.5.  Cut all four corners of the box from the top to about three-fourths of the way down (or less). 18.9.6.  Again  using  masking  tape,  tape  one  strip  up  the  cut  portion  and  two  across,  as illustrated. 18.9.7.  After filling the box with leaflets, tie the two strips of webbing. AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   205  18.9.8.  Attach  one  end  of  the  static  line  to  the  webbing  ties.    The  length  of  the  static  line should  be  a  minimum  of  15  feet  long.    The  box  is  rolled  out  of  the  aircraft  and  as  the container comes to the end of the static line, the sides of the box split.  In effect, it is turned inside out.  The leaflets fall away followed by the empty box. 18.9.9.  This  is  one  method,  and  may  not  be  the  method  suited  for  your  mission.    Other variations do exist; however, this is the most universal and least complex. 18.10.  Preparation  for  Airdrop.  After  takeoff,  take  the  following  actions  before  starting  the leaflet airdrop checklist. 18.10.1.  Cover the cargo door switch with a length of tape to prevent accidental operation of the door with the aft anchor cable support arm down. 18.10.2.  Lower  anchor  cables  and  connect  them  to  the  outboard  side  of  the  anchor  cable supports. 18.10.3.  Isolate  the  aft  anchor  cable  support  arm  micro  switches  by  pulling  ECB  834  (L ANCHOR LINE ARM)  and ECB 835 (R ANCHOR LINE ARM). 18.10.4.  Position/don emergency equipment and survival gear. 18.10.5.  Begin Leaflet Airdrop checklist. 18.11.  Aircrew  Procedures.  Normally  leaflet  airdrops  requires  two  PTs  (for  high-altitude airdrops)  and  three  additional  crew  members  to  act  as  feeders.    The  primary  loadmaster  will assign specific positions for activity in the cargo compartment.  (T-2) 18.11.1.  Drop  Configuration/Maneuvering.    Base  configuration  on  desired  coverage  and airframe airspeed limitations.  All personnel should be constantly aware of the possibility of an emergency break upon encountering a threat. 18.11.1.1.  Flaps.  Flaps are normally set at 50% and flap settings should not be changed during  the  drop  unless  the  loadmaster  is  notified.      Note:    At  very  high-altitudes,  the aircraft  may  not  be  able  to  maintain  drop  airspeed  with  50%  flaps.    Under  these conditions, use an intermediate flap setting that allows for aircraft performance and also produces an acceptable deck angle for the drop.  A flap setting near 20% gives the best aircraft wing performance while providing high rudder boost for controllability. 18.12.  Static Lines.  To increase speed of closing the ramp if a hostile threat is detected and to prevent damage to the aircraft, the static lines should be stowed after each box goes out.  Do this if the interval between boxes permits safe operation.  Static lines may be cut in an emergency.   206  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 Chapter 19 SEARCH AND RESCUE PROCEDURES 19.1.  General.  Most searches are part of an effort to save life; therefore, make every effort to complete  the  search  as  rapidly  and  efficiently  as  possible.    A  thorough  scan  of  the  search  area and accurate navigation significantly increase the probability of detection.  Reactions to sightings must  be  timely  and  accurate.    This  section  outlines  operational  procedures  for  conducting effective  searches  in  the  C-130  aircraft.    Refer  to  the  International  Aeronautical  and  Maritime Search and Rescue Manual (IAMSAR) Volumes I/II for additional information.  (T-2) 19.1.1.  Search  and  Rescue  Satellite-Aided  Tracking  (SARSAT).  SARSAT  is  an international satellite system for Search and Rescue (SAR).  It consists of a constellation of seven satellites in low earth orbit, 5 geostationary satellites and a network of earth stations, which  provide  distress  alert  and  location  information  to  appropriate  rescue  authorities anywhere  in  the  world  for  users  in  distress.    The  SARSAT  satellites  detect  beacons broadcasting  on  406.025  MHz.    The  current  SARSAT  system  consists  of  64  Local  User Terminals (LUT) and 26 Mission Control Centers in 32 countries, including 12 in the United States.  SARSAT coverage on 406 MHz is worldwide.  The RCC at Langley Air Force Base (AFB), VA, maintains a deployable LUT capability (camper sized, air transportable vans) to provide contingency coverage.

Search Altitude (Table 19  7).  Select an optimum search altitude based upon the object of  search,  weather  in  the  search  area,  electronic  or  visual  location  aids  used,  and  any  other known factor, which  would  affect  the search  altitude.  Generally, the lower the search altitude, the  better  the  chance  of  seeing  an  object,  provided  the  altitude  is  not  so  low  that  the  aircraft speed  becomes  detrimental.    During  preliminary  searches,  the  altitude  will  be  higher  to  detect possible signals at greater distances.  (T-2) 19.3.  Search Procedures. 19.3.1.  Rescue  missions  often  involve  commitment  based  upon  calculated  risks.    Give  full consideration to all safety factors.  Timely reaction to all search missions is essential to the safety  of  personnel  or  equipment.    Do  not  jeopardize  safety  by  inadequate  preparation  or short cuts to expedite takeoff, or arrival at search areas.  For search missions use the Search Checklist.    Aircrews  will  comply  with  all  other  applicable  directives,  which  govern  their duties, such as: (T2) 19.3.1.1.  Accomplish  complete  pre-departure  flight  planning  except  for  scramble missions.  On scramble missions, complete essential flight planning prior to and shortly after takeoff. 19.3.1.2.  Use in-flight procedures in accordance with the appropriate theater of operation flight regulations. 19.3.1.2.1.  Aircraft  will  maintain  vertical  and  horizontal  separation  in  the  search area.  This is critical when several aircraft are searching within close proximity.  (T-2) Table 19.7.

Scanners  who  are  not  aircrew  members  will  receive  a  briefing  on  the  search objective.  (T-2) 19.3.2.3.  The  PIC  will  supervise  and  coordinate  activities  of  crew  members  during preparation for search, as follows: (T-2) 19.3.2.3.1.  Plan the search. 19.3.2.3.2.  Discuss scanning procedures. 19.3.2.3.3.  Discuss the procedures for making search pattern turns. 19.3.2.3.4.  Discuss the radio communication procedures with the CSO and copilot. 19.3.2.3.5.  Discuss  the  preparation  of  flares,  sea  dyes,  and  smoke  signals  for deployment with the loadmaster. 19.3.2.3.6.  Discuss the preparation of personnel and equipment for airborne delivery with  the  loadmaster  and  pararescuemen.    Ensure  all  crew  members  are  thoroughly familiar with the checklists to be used for various airborne delivery options. 19.3.2.4.  The  PIC  will  coordinate  crew  member  activities  during  prosecution  of  the search by: (T-2) 19.3.2.4.1.  Ensuring  completion  of  the  Search  Checklist  prior  to  commencing  any low-level search. AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   211  19.3.2.4.2.  Alerting  the  scanners  to  begin  scanning  when  approaching  the  search area. 19.3.2.4.3.  Directing crew members to put on their LPUs prior to descending below 2,000 feet overwater. 19.3.2.4.4.  Checking with crew members to  ensure all equipment  and personnel  are ready for action in the event of a sighting. 19.3.2.4.5.  Making  periodic  checks  of  fuel  remaining  to  ensure  sufficient  fuel remains for return to home station. 19.3.2.5.

Initiate recovery  action  or  assistance  when  the  survivors  are  located  and  inform  appropriate agencies of the progress. 19.3.2.7.  The CSO will: (T-2) 19.3.2.7.1.  Maintain an accurate record of area searched. 19.3.2.7.2.  Direct the aircraft to ensure proper coverage of the search area. 19.3.2.7.3.  Continually  cross-check  headings,  drift,  time,  airspeed,  and  altitude  to maintain the best possible search coverage. 19.3.2.7.4.  Use  a  large-scale  chart  when  searching  over  land  to  ensure  terrain  and obstacle clearance.  Use a search pattern graph as a suitable reference while searching overwater. 19.3.2.7.5.  Record sighting information on log and plot position on navigation chart. 19.3.2.7.6.  Monitor equipment during radar and electronic searches. 19.3.2.7.7.  Debrief  controlling  agency  with  an  accurate  depiction  of  any  areas searched. 19.3.2.7.8.  When other aircraft are involved, track and assign search areas for other aircraft. 19.3.2.8.  The  PIC  will  insure  radio  communications  are  maintained  with  other  search aircraft and the controlling agency.  (T-2) 19.3.2.9.  The  loadmaster  will  assume  supervision  of  the  scanners  and  will  schedule rotation and rest periods.  Scanners should be rotated every 30 to 45 minutes of scanning and rested after two hours, if enough scanners are available.  (T-2) 19.3.2.10.  All crew members will assist with the scanning duties when possible.  (T-2) 19.3.2.11.  When a search is completed with negative results, consider searching the area again.  Normally, position subsequent  search legs between or 45° to the previous search legs.  This procedure, in effect, results in smaller track spacing. 19.3.3.  In the search area: 19.3.3.1.  Descend to search altitude (Table 19.7).   212  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 19.3.3.2.  Have  CSO  obtain  the  wind  at  search  altitude.    To  visually  cover  the  area thoroughly,  slow  the  airspeed  during  search  patterns  (refer  to  the  Aircraft  Performance Manual). 19.3.3.3.  Notify ATC of arrival on scene and estimated endurance. 19.3.3.4.  Vector other aircraft to the scene. 19.3.3.5.  Use radar (some life rafts carry reflectors). 19.3.3.6.  Assume  on-scene  command  until  relieved  by  another  duly  appointed  SAR aircraft.  As other aircraft arrive, do the following: 19.3.3.6.1.  Establish contact on channels other than Guard. 19.3.3.6.2.  Obtain aircraft type identification, endurance, and rescue capability. 19.3.3.6.3.  Assign altimeter settings, frequencies, search areas, patterns, and altitude separation. 19.3.3.7.  If leaving the search area because of lack of fuel, assign another aircraft as on-scene commander. 19.3.4.  Determine an accurate wind prior to and throughout the search.  Use  Table  19.9 to estimate wind velocity near the surface. 19.3.5.  When  flying  search  patterns,  turns  must  be  accurate  and  uniform  as  possible.    The following procedures are provided to assist the aircrew in making precise turns: (T-2) 19.3.5.1.  Fly the aircraft on autopilot when possible. 19.3.5.2.  Prior  to  starting  the  pattern,  the  CSO  will  brief  the  crew  on  the  direction  and rate of turn and the turn command procedure used.  (T-2) 19.3.5.3.  Normally, all turns are standard rate (3° per second) unless track spacing is less in  distance  than  the  diameter  of  a  standard  turn  at  a  given  speed.    In  this  situation, continue turn to 180° and adjust turn rate as required to remain within the pattern. Table 19.8.

If survivors are in life jackets, make attempts as soon as possible to furnish them with life rafts or other survival equipment and signaling devices. 19.3.5.5.  Direct  potential  rescue  or  recovery  vessels  and  other  aircraft  to  the  scene  by radio  or  visual  signals.    Radio  and  visual  signals  you  may  use  to  direct  a  vessel  to  the scene to include: 19.3.5.6.  Radio message to the vessel. 19.3.5.6.1.  ADF  to  take  bearings  on  a  vessel's  Low  Frequency  (LF)  or  Medium Frequency (MF) transmissions. 19.3.5.6.2.  VHF  or  UHF  direction  finder  to  take  bearings  of  VHF  or  UHF transmissions. 19.3.5.6.3.  Radar and IFF. 19.3.5.6.4.  Signal light. 19.3.5.6.5.  Dropping message containers.   214  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 19.3.5.6.6.  Pyrotechnic flares. 19.3.5.6.7.  When radio communications are not possible, establish self-identification, then indicate location of the target by: 19.3.5.6.7.1.  Circling the vessel at least once at low-altitude. 19.3.5.6.7.2.  Flying across the bow of the vessel at least once, and rocking wings at the same time. 19.3.5.6.7.3.  Sending  a  message  by  signal  light  or  dropping  a  message,  if possible. 19.3.5.6.7.4.  Heading  in  the  direction  of  the  target.    Repeat  this  procedure  until the vessel acknowledges by following the aircraft, or indicates that it is unable to comply  by  hoisting  the  International  Flag,  November  (the  International  Flag, November,  is  a  blue  and  white  checkerboard).    Crossing  the  wake  of  the  vessel close  astern  at  a  low-altitude  means  that  the  service  of  the  vessel  to  which  the signal is directed is no longer required. 19.3.5.7.  In daytime, use any of the following means to inform survivors they have been sighted: 19.3.5.7.1.  Fly low over survivors with landing lights on. 19.3.5.7.2.  Blink a signal light in the direction of survivors. 19.3.5.7.3.  Drop two marker signals a few seconds apart. 19.3.5.8.  Aircrews sighting survivors at night should: 19.3.5.8.1.  Mark  the  position  by  dropping  marker  smoke  or  strobe  lights  with floatation collars. 19.3.5.8.2.  Request assistance from other search aircraft or ships. 19.3.5.8.2.1.  If a rescue vessel arrives in the area, direct it to the scene by giving the target position in relation to the float light.  Drop parachute flares to assist the rescue or recovery vessel in sighting the target. 19.3.5.8.2.2.  If  the  objective  has  not  been  located,  but  its  position  is  fairly  well established, drop two strobe lights or datum marker buoys to outline the limits of the  search  area,  the  most  probable  position  of  target  being  halfway  between  the lights.  Start the search from one light to the other, dropping parachute flares for illumination. 19.3.5.8.2.3.  If no surface vessel is available, but two aircraft are on-scene, have one aircraft fly over the area at 3,000 feet dropping flares at 2- or 3-mile intervals.  Station the other aircraft 3 miles behind the illuminating aircraft, slightly upwind at 500 feet to search. 19.4.  Departing Search Area. 19.4.1.  Notify  ATC  and  the  appropriate  SAR  agency  on-scene,  SAR  aircraft,  Rescue Coordination Center, etc. AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   215  19.4.2.  If  other  search  aircraft  have  not  arrived,  reconfirm  position,  and  advise  survivors when further assistance will arrive, if known.  (T-2) 19.5.  Rescue  Airdrops.  Rescue  airdrops  of  rescue  equipment  allow  rapid  deployment  of  Sea Rescue  Kits,  pyrotechnics,  emergency  equipment,  etc.,  in  an  unplanned  and  rapidly  changing environment.    An  example  would  be  dropping  a  Sea  Rescue  Kit  to  a  helicopter  that  ditched during  helicopter  air  refueling.    Specific  patterns  are  Sea  Rescue  Kit  deployments  and Parabundle and Freefall equipment drops. 19.5.1.  The pilot will always brief the pattern and delivery to be flown.  (T-2) 19.5.1.1.  As  a  minimum,  brief  the  type  of  equipment  to  be  delivered,  delivery  method (pattern shape, relationship to wind, etc.), altitudes, airspeeds, commands to be used, and required actions for malfunctions. 19.5.2.  Sea  Rescue  Kit  Deployment.    The  Sea  Rescue  Kit  is  designed  to  meet  conditions, which require aerial delivery of emergency floatation and survival gear.  The kit is dropped free-fall  and  abeam  during  a  crosswind  pass  over  the  target.    When  correctly  dropped,  a straight line is formed on the water with an inflated raft at each end.  After delivery, the two rafts  with  their  high  freeboard  will  begin  to  drift  downwind  until  retarded  by  the  partially submerged supply containers.  Thus, when the kit is properly deployed, wind conditions will cause the kit to form a "U," partially encircling the target.  (T-2) 19.5.2.1.  Surface wind will affect the kit and target in varying amounts in proportion to the  area  exposed  above  the  water  and  displacement  below  the  water.    The  kit  will  drift faster  than  nearly  all-seagoing  vessels  (outboards,  cabin  cruisers,  trawlers,  heavy displacement deep draft vessels, and 1 man life rafts) but slower than a 6-, 7-, or 20-man raft.  If a kit drifts faster, it will be delivered upwind.  If the target drifts faster, the kit will be delivered downwind.  When the surface wind is less than 15 knots, the delivery pass will be offset approximately 50 feet.  Distance will be increased 25 feet for each 10 knots in  excess  of  the  15-knot  base.    (T-2)    Exception:    Downwind  kit  drops  will  always  be offset approximately 50 feet.  Do not correct for wind.  (T-2) 19.5.2.2.  When deploying a Sea Rescue Kit in high winds, the kit may be deployed with the rafts deflated to improve drop accuracy.  See  Paragraph 19.11.2 for special rigging instructions. 19.5.2.3.  Pyrotechnics  may  be  useful  in  determining  wind  strength  and  direction,  and maintaining pattern orientation. 19.5.2.4.  Standard Sea Rescue Kit Pattern Procedures (Figure 19.10). 19.5.2.4.1.  Maneuver  the  aircraft  onto  a  flight  path  that  is  crosswind  and approximately 50 feet from the target on the side opposite to that of the intended kit delivery.  Maintain drop altitude and airspeed.   216  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 Figure 19.2.  Standard Sea Rescue Kit Pattern.  19.5.2.4.2.  When abeam the target, begin the count (use seconds).  Two seconds past the target, release a smoke marker (if available).  The PF will count over interphone, "One thousand one, one thousand drop." On the command of "drop," the loadmaster will manually launch a smoke marker.  (T-2) 19.5.2.4.3.  Maintain  heading  for  10  seconds  and  drop  second  timing  signal  (if available).  Turn 45° to the right and hold that heading for 15 seconds.  Make a 180° left-hand standard rate turn.  Adjust turn to final so as to pass upwind or downwind of the target (as required for the delivery).  Distance will vary with the type of target and wind velocity.  Rolling out, the pilot will notify the crew:  "30 seconds to target." (T-2) 19.5.2.4.4.  Approximately  10  seconds  from  the  smoke  marker,  the  pilot  will  notify crew:    "10 seconds."  Just  prior  to  abeam  the  smoke  marker,  the  PF  will  command "Ready," and then abeam the marker, "Drop." (T-2)     Note:  Aircraft without marker signals should fly the pattern as described and attempt to drop the kit 4 seconds prior to the target. 19.5.2.5.  CSO  Assistance for Sea Rescue Kits.  The CSO can assist the pilot by the use of onboard systems.  The CSO will advise the pilot when the aircraft approaches the final delivery track.  (T-2) 19.5.2.5.1.  The CSO should set up the CNI-MU as follows: 19.5.2.5.1.1.  During  the  flight  plan  programming  portion  of  the  preflight,  the AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   217  CSO should load two dummy waypoints that will later serve as the IP and target.  (The target will be the location of the survivor or position to which the kit will be delivered.).   (T-2)     Note:  This  step will save time in-flight  by eliminating the need to modify the flight plan sequence.  (T-2) 19.5.2.5.1.2.  As the aircraft flies over the target on the initial pass, the CSO will mark  this  position  and  store  it.    The  wind  (e.g.,  180/015)  should  be  noted  and recorded at this time.  The onboard system will allow the CSO to direct the pilot perpendicular to the wind on the final run-in to the target.  (T-2) 19.5.2.5.1.3.  Go to the plan page.  Call up the dummy waypoint that was initially designated the target and redesignate it as the mark point (stored target position).  Verify this waypoint. 19.5.2.5.1.4.  Go to the preceding waypoint and redesignate it as the mark point. 19.5.2.5.1.5.  Define  an  Initial  Point  (IP)  using  a  range  and  bearing  from  the original mark point and save it as the waypoint prior to the target.  Use a bearing that is the reciprocal of the desired run-in heading (e.g., 090/270°) and a range of 5 to 10 nm and verify.  The pilot must confirm the final run-in heading before the CSO can load the bearing.  (T-2)    Note:  Keep in mind that the target will drift.  This  is  basically a visual maneuver; the nav systems  are used  as a backup.  The pilot should make every attempt to keep the target in sight.  (T-2) 19.5.2.5.1.6.  The pilot will use the system to help maintain situational awareness and  line  up  on  the  target  for  the  delivery  pass.    During  the  run-in,  the  pilot  will offset upwind or downwind as necessary (see Paragraph 19.10.2.1).  (T-2) 19.5.3.  Parabundle and Freefall Deployment: 19.5.3.1.  When practical, use a racetrack pattern with the drop heading into the wind for equipment  drops;  however,  circumstances  may  dictate  a  modified  pattern.    Equipment may  be  dropped  from  the  paratroop  doors  or  the  aft  cargo  door  and  ramp.    The  first bundle dropped is, in  effect, a spotter bundle; therefore, it should be the least critical to the survivors.  Water deliveries must consider wind, drift, and sea state.      WARNING:  The  delivery  of  equipment,  no  matter  how  vital,  must  never  endanger  the  lives  of  the receivers.  (T-2) 19.5.3.2.  Equipment deliveries to land drop zones should be planned to impact within 50 yards of the target.   Water deliveries should be planned to  impact  within 5  yards of the target  or  within  a  45°  sector  centered  on  the  drift  line  for  100  yards.    In  any  case, deliveries should never be in excess of 5 yards up-drift of the target. 19.5.3.3.  Pilot  Procedures.    Pilots  are  responsible  for  determining  the  mode  of deployment;  drop  location,  and  type  pattern  to  be  flown.    They  must  ensure  the loadmaster is aware of the desired point of impact (PI).  When the situation permits, the pilot will make an observation pass over the drop zone.  Final freefall altitude will be no lower  than  150  feet  AGL.    Final  parabundle  altitude  should  be  no  lower  than  300  feet AGL.  Minimum altitude for all night airdrops is 500 feet AGL.  (T-2)      WARNING:  Keep turns below 300 feet AGL to a minimum.   218  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 19.5.3.3.1.  Aircraft  altitude,  attitude,  course,  and  airspeed  should  be  established  by 30 seconds to  target  and no later than 10 seconds to  target.   The pilot  will keep the crew apprised of their position in the pattern.  As a minimum, on final the pilot will state "30 seconds to target," then "10 seconds."  Once the loadmaster spots the target, he  will  state,  "Target  in  sight"  and  provide  the  pilot  with  course  corrections  if  time permits.  (T-2) 19.5.3.4.  Loadmaster  Procedures.    Loadmasters  must  understand  the  location  of  the desired PI. When looking for the target, the loadmaster will use either paratroop door.  If the PI is difficult to spot, ask the pilot to give a countdown to the PI on the run in.  (T-2) 19.5.3.4.1.  The loadmaster will hook up the restraint harness as described in Chapter 6.    The  jump  platform  will  be  extended  and  the  air  deflector  doors  opened.    The loadmaster  may  align  the  aircraft  for  the  airdrop  by  sighting  down  the  edge  of  the jump  platform  to  the  drop  zone  and  steering  the  aircraft  with  standard  calls  of “Steady,”  “Right,  (number  of)  degrees,”  or  “Left,  (number  of)  degrees.”  (T-2)     Note:  If the loadmaster places their head on the jump platform to sight and align the aircraft,  they  should  place  their  head  toward  the  forward  edge  for  parabundle airdrops,  and  move  their  head  aft  for  freefall  airdrops  and  to  compensate  for  higher altitudes. 19.5.3.4.2.  Bundle  dimensions  for  paratroop  door  drops,  including  the  parachute, must not exceed 48 by 30 by 66 inches.  Bundles in excess of 100 pounds require a second  pusher  and  those  between  350-500  pounds  require  two  additional  pushers.  For equipment to be delivered from the paratroop door, attach the static line (if used) to tie-down ring 26-B or 26-F.  Secure equipment until it is ready for delivery.  (T-2) 19.5.3.4.3.  If equipment cannot be delivered from the paratroop door, the loadmaster may  prepare  and  position  the  equipment  on  the  ramp  for  delivery,  and  use  another thoroughly  briefed  crew  member  to  release  the  equipment.    The  equipment  will  be secured until ready for delivery.  For equipment to be delivered from the ramp, attach the static line (if used) to a tie-down ring in row 30.  (T-2) 19.5.3.4.4.  The loadmaster will normally spot the target 8 seconds prior to the release point, and give the preparatory command  "Ready"  and the deployment command of "Drop."  After each delivery, the loadmaster will report status of drop (load clear or status) and impact point whenever possible.  (T-2) 19.5.3.5.  Equipment  Delivery  in  Forested  Areas.    Due  to  the  possibility  of  equipment hang-up  in  trees,  consideration  should  be  given  to  attaching  drop  lines  to  equipment intended to  be delivered by parachute.  The drop line needs to  be long enough to  allow the chute to hang-up in treetops, and still permit ground forces to recover the equipment.  In addition to the drop lines now in use by units (local design and manufacture), consider the possibility of using equipment already maintained on the aircraft, such as Sea Rescue Kit  buoyant  rope  (210  feet  long).    Drop  lines  will  be  secured  to  the  parachute  riser snaps/connectors  and  equipment  package  "D/V  rings"  with  carabineers  or  equivalent.  The  drop  line  will  be  assembled  into  accordion  "S"  folds,  secured  with  retainer  bands, and attached to the equipment package.  (T-2)   Note:  Final approach altitude should be adjusted to compensate for tree height, but never less than 150 feet above the treetops. AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   219  19.5.3.6.  Pattern  for  Night  Aerial  Delivery.    NVGs  may  be  used  for  night  operations.  Aircrews will accomplish the Combat Entry checklist to configure the aircraft for NVG operations.  (T-2) 19.5.3.7.  Night  Delivery.    Equipment  to  be  delivered  at  night  will  have  marker  lights attached.  For water drops, attach the light by securing a double 5-foot length of type III nylon (550/cord) to the marker light, then attach the other end to the equipment.  Stabilize the light to the equipment with type number 5 cord.  Pass the parachute static line under the  type  number  5  cord  to  ensure  light  breakaway  when  deployed.    For  land  drops, chemlites are recommended.  Attach chemlites securely to prevent detachment.  (T-2) 19.6.  Sea Rescue Kits: 19.6.1.  The Sea Rescue Kit consists of five bundles: 19.6.1.1.  The  two  end  bundles  (1  and  5)  contain  either  a  six,  seven  or  20  man  raft.  Bundles 2 and 4 contain emergency radios and bundle 3 contains medical gear. 19.6.1.2.  The total weight of all five bundles is 232 lbs for a MA-1 kit and 311 lbs for a MA-2 kit. 19.6.1.3.  Each bundle is connected by 210 feet of buoyant rope. 19.6.1.4.  The kit is deployed manually off the cargo ramp. 19.6.2.  Rigging Sequence. 19.6.2.1.  Rigging sequence will be as shown in Figure 19.3.  (T-2) 19.6.2.2.  During in-flight rigging, the cargo ramp and door will remain closed.  Attach a tie-down strap across the kit to prevent movement.  (T-2) 19.6.2.3.  Unsnap the inflation lanyard protection flap of container #1 (raft), marked 1 of 5  and  leave  open.

General. launching pyrotechnics.    Refer  to  TO  11A10-24-7,  Storage  and  Maintenance  Procedures-Aircraft Parachute  Flares  TO 11A10-26-7,  Storage  and  Maintenance  Procedures-Pyrotechnic Signals,  TO 11A10277, Specialized  Storage  and  Maintenance  Procedures-Simulators information in  preparation  for   222  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 (Battlefield  Effects)  and  TO  11A10-28-7,  Storage  and  Maintenance  Procedures-Infrared TRKG Flares. 19.7.2.  Hazards.    In  general,  pyrotechnics  contain  materials  of  a  hazardous  nature.    Even though each of the ingredients in a pyrotechnic composition may be relatively stable within itself, it may react with one or more of the other materials to cause deterioration and create an even greater hazard.  Pyrotechnics are more dangerous than many other types of ammunition because  they  are  more  easily  activated.    These  items  should  not  be  handled  roughly  or exposed to moisture.  When subjected to fire, most pyrotechnics burn with intense heat. 19.7.2.1.  Toxic Hazards.  Many chemicals used in pyrotechnic devices are poisonous if taken  internally.    This  also  applies  to  the  residues  of  burned  pyrotechnics.    From  an inhalation standpoint, the products of pyrotechnic devices and smoke generators present a serious problem.  Although most of the smoke and fumes given off by pyrotechnics are considered nontoxic, heavy concentrations in closely confined spaces are dangerous and may be lethal, for they reduce the amount of available oxygen in the air. 19.7.3.  Handling.  Besides the hazardous basic compositions, pyrotechnics contain sensitive elements such as fuses, friction compositions, and primers.  Pyrotechnics should be handled with  care  and  protected  against  moisture,  shock,  friction,  or  heat.    Care  should  be  taken  to avoid  premature  ignition  or  damage  that  may  cause  failure  when  fired.    Boxes  containing pyrotechnics  should  not  be  dropped  or  thrown.    Protective  or  safety  devices  should  not  be removed until just before use.  Care should be taken to avoid damage to fiber cases and rip cords  located  outside  the  casing  of  flares.    Pyrotechnics  should  be  handled  so  as  to  avoid denting or deforming the barrel or case.  Do not use pyrotechnics that are dented, deformed, cracked, broken, or have signs of advanced rust, looped closing, or have shipping covers with an  illegible  lot  number,  manufacture  date,  or  other  required  identifying  information.  Pyrotechnics  will  be  handled  only  under  the  supervision  of  a  competent,  qualified  person.  Most pyrotechnics burn with intense heat; therefore, personnel should be adequately prepared to handle an emergency situation (e.g., heat resistant gloves and broom).  (T-2) 19.7.4.  Storage.  Units that have a requirement for storing pyrotechnics will obtain a license from the host base.  (T-2) 19.7.5.  Issue  Procedures.    Pyrotechnics  that  have  been  issued  for  training  purposes  will  be marked in bold capital letters with the word TRAINING.  These pyrotechnics will always be stored separately from operational stock within storage areas.  (T-2) 19.7.6.  Safety.    All  of  the  pyrotechnics  described  contain  combustible  chemicals  which, when  ignited,  generate  a  flame  or  smoke  (or  combination  of  both)  for  a  broad  variety  of purposes.    These  purposes  include  visual  signaling,  area  or  target  illumination,  and  point marking.  Most are intended to burn with intense heat. 19.7.6.1.  Initiation  Mechanism.    Pyrotechnic  devices  normally  are  equipped  with  some type of safety pin, lock, or tape designed to prevent accidental activation of the initiation mechanism.    Any  pyrotechnic  which  shows  sign  of  damage  to  safety  features  is considered  unserviceable  and  must  be  carefully  segregated  for  prompt  disposition  by EOD.  (T-2) 19.7.6.2.  Accidental Initiation.  If a pyrotechnic device should be accidentally ignited, in all  cases  its  functioning  will  result  in  a  fire  hazard.    The  gases  generated  by  this AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   223  combustion could present a serious toxic hazard.  Signaling devices containing propellant charges create an extremely dangerous missile hazard if accidentally ignited.  (T-2) 19.7.6.3.  Fighting  Pyrotechnic  Fires.   Pyrotechnic  compositions  characteristically contain  their  own  oxidants,  and  therefore  do  not  depend  upon  atmospheric  oxygen  for combustion.  For this reason, excluding air from a pyrotechnic fire usually is ineffective.  Many  pyrotechnic  mixtures,  particularly  illuminating  flare  compositions,  burn  with intense heat up to 4,500° F.  Normally, available extinguishers are of little or no value in fires of this kind, and in addition, may produce toxic or poisonous gases. 19.7.6.4.  Safe Altitudes and Distances.  Flares not entirely burned out and cooled when they land may ignite combustible material.  Safe altitudes and distances depend upon the burning  time,  rate  of  descent,  and  drift  of  the  flare.    Such  factors  will  be  considered  in determining minimum altitudes and distances of release.  Signal flares are also a potential fire hazard when the parachute fails to support the signal properly.  (T-2)     CAUTION:  Flares will not be launched over areas subject to fire except in an extreme emergency.  If such  an  emergency  exists,  flares  should  be  dropped  from  sufficient  altitude  to  allow complete burnout before hitting the surface.  (T-2) 19.7.6.5.  Reporting  Instructions.    Prepare  instructions  for  mishaps,  accidents,  and incidents  in  accordance  with  AFI  91-204,  Safety  Investigations  and  Reports.    Prepare unsatisfactory  reports  in  accordance  with  TO00-35D-54,  USAF  Deficiency  Reporting, Investigation, and Resolution. 19.7.7.  Pyrotechnics Launching: 19.7.7.1.  Personnel  launching  pyrotechnics  through  open  doors  or  hatches  will  wear  a restraint harness or parachute, and will have armored or heat resistant gloves and a broom or wood stick readily  available  in  case of fire.   Wearing nomex gloves  when deploying pyrotechnics  is  recommended.    When  manually  launching  parachute  flares  from  the aircraft, only the cargo ramp will be opened unless the mission dictates otherwise.  (This is to assist in eliminating pyrotechnics missile hazard.) (T-2) 19.7.7.2.  The  aircraft  will  be  prepared  for  flare  jettison  prior  to  handling  any pyrotechnic.    Only  the  cargo  ramp  will  be  opened  unless  mission  requirements  dictate otherwise.  All parachute flares hand-launched from the ramp will use a 10-foot lanyard (Refer to Figure  19.13).  The flare will be hand-launched upon command of the PIC or designated crew member.  (T-2)      CAUTION:  Personnel  launching flares will ensure the  lanyard  system  is  clear  of  extremities  and  equipment  before  launching.    Excess lanyard should be accordion folded and held against the body of the flare or taped with paper tape.  (T-2) 19.7.8.  Pyrotechnics Description and Operation: 19.7.8.1.  LUU-2/B, 2A/B; Flare, Aircraft Parachute. 19.7.8.1.1.  Description.  The LUU-2/B, 2A/B is an air-launched parachute flare.  It is 36  inches  long,  4.875  inches  in  diameter  and  rated  as  providing  2-million candlepower illumination for approximately 300 seconds (5 minutes).  Some uses are illumination of areas for crash landing, ditching, landing, target, dropping of supplies, hovering of rescue aircraft, etc.   224  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 19.7.8.1.2.  Operation.  Remove the flare from the shipping container and set desired feet of fall in the flare timer end cap.  A setting of 500 feet represents a time delay of 6.3 seconds.  A launch altitude of 3,000 feet AGL is recommended and will provide a light at 2,500 feet AGL.  The flare descends approximately 2,500 feet during burning and will burn out and dump at ground level.  The snap hook in the lanyard package of the  flare  shipping  container  may  be  used  for  the  flare  attaching  end.    The  10-foot lanyard secured to a tie-down ring near the aft end of the ramp will be attached to the lanyard or to the timer dial knob.  Upon launch signal, toss the flare overboard from the rear of the ramp, or floor jettison port with ignition end out first (ignition end is opposite from the timer end cap).  A force of 30 to 35 pounds is required to extract the timer dial knob and drogue cover strip.  The knob and cover strip will remain with the static line.  Retrieve the static line and remove the timer dial knob from the snap hook.  Stow the timer dial knob until mission is over; then dispose of all residue.  (T-2) 19.7.8.2.  LUU-4B; Flare, Aircraft Parachute: 19.7.8.2.1.  Description.  The LUU-4/B is an air launched parachute flare.  It is 25.5 inches long, 4.875 inches in diameter, and rated as providing 1.6-million candlepower illumination  for  approximately  180  seconds  (3  minutes).    Uses  are  the  same  as  the LUU-2/B, 2A/B. 19.7.8.2.2.  Operation.  The flare altitude should be planned so as that burnout occurs approximately 300 feet AGL overwater and higher over land.  Recommend maximum deployment  airspeed  of  200  KIAS/KCAS  due  to  possible  failure  of  the  parachute system.  Manual launch procedures are the same as LUU-2/B procedures. 19.7.8.3.  LUU-2/B, LUU-2A/B, LUU-4/B Emergency Procedures: 19.7.8.3.1.  Premature  timer  release/ignition  in  aircraft  or  storage  container:    Nylon cord  -  Cut;  Container  -  Taped;  Pilot  -  Notified.              WARNING:    In  the  event  the timer  end  cap  is  separated  from  the  flare,  do  not  pull  on  the  nylon  cord  or  the parachute.    An  approximate  50-pound  pull  on  one  of  the  suspension  cables  of  the parachute will cause the flare to ignite.  Return the flare to the shipping container and turn flare over to EOD at mission completion.  (T-2) 19.7.8.3.2.  Pre-ignition  of  Flare:    Jettison  flare  or  container  immediately;  Pilot-notified.          WARNING:    In  the  event  of  flare  ignition,  an  attempt  will  be  made  to jettison the flare.  In event of candle ignition, intense light, heat, and lethal gas will be experienced.  Adequate respiratory, eye, and hand protection will be sought  as soon as emergency permits.  Flare suppression will be attempted as a last resort.  (T-2) 19.7.8.3.3.  Flare  breakaway  fails  to  release:    Static  line  -  Cut;  Pilot  -  Notified.     WARNING:    Packaged  aircraft  parachute  flares  dropped  in  excess  of  3  feet  or unpackaged flares dropped in excess of 1 foot shall be considered unserviceable. 19.7.8.4.  MK-6 MOD 3; Signal, Smoke, and Illumination, Aircraft: 19.7.8.4.1.  Description.  This signal marker provides long burning (approximately 40 minutes)  surface  smoke  and  illumination  for  day  or  night  use.    It  is  used  to  mark sightings at sea, make sea evaluations, marking a sea lane for night water landing, and AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   225  to  simulate  targets  for  the  firing  of  weapons.    It  may  be  used  to  provide  smoke  on land surfaces if a fire hazard does not exist. 19.7.8.4.2.  Operation.    Prior  to  launching  the  signal  marker,  remove  the  adhesive tape  covering  the  pull  ring.          WARNING:    The  smoke  signal  has  a  90  second ignition delay and must be launched immediately after the igniter has been actuated.  (T-2)          WARNING:    Packaged  signal  markers  dropped  in  excess  of  10  feet  or unpackaged signals dropped in excess of 5 feet shall be considered unserviceable, and reported  to  OO-ALC/MMWR,  Hill  AFB,  UT  84056-5609.        WARNING:    Do  not prepare more than 2 marks at a time, and do not remove more than 4 marks at a time from the storage container in-flight.     Note:  Do not remove the four square patches of  adhesive  tape  covering  the  metal  caps  in  the  holes  from  which  flame  and  smoke issue  after  ignition  of  the  candle.    At  the  time  the  signal  is  launched,  the  pull-type igniter is actuated by hand. 19.7.8.5.  MK-25 MOD 3; Marker, Location Marine: 19.7.8.5.1.  Description.    This  marker  was  designed  for  day  or  night  use  for  all surface reference point  marking purposes that call for smoke and flame  in  the 13 to 18 minute range. 19.7.8.5.2.  Operation.    To  activate  the  marker,  the  base  plate  must  be  rotated  from the safe to the armed position to allow the battery cavity ports to be opened.  Open the ports  by  pressing  the  two  brass-colored  port  plugs  into  the  battery  cavity  using  the thumb and forefinger.  A one-pound force is required for plug removal.  This device is considered to be a sealed unit until either or both base plugs have been pushed in.  (T-2)           WARNING:  The MK-25 must not be returned to storage with the base plugs pushed in.  The nose end of this marker must be kept out of line with the body or with other personnel at all times.  If marker is initiated, the nose plug is expelled with considerable force creating a missile hazard.  (T-2) 19.7.8.5.3.  Special Precautions.  This marker may be converted for use in fresh water by  adding  1/2  or  3/4  ounces  of  table  salt  or  two  salt  tablets  through  the  base  plugs.    WARNING:    Converted  markers  must  be  used  after  adding  salt.    They  must  not  be returned  to  storage.    If  not  used,  they  must  be  jettisoned  in-flight,  overwater.    (T-2)        CAUTION:  Be sure salt is not exposed to moisture before and during the conversion process, as moist salt may cause marker to ignite.        CAUTION:  Packaged flares dropped in excess of 6 feet or unpackaged flares dropped in excess of 3 feet shall be considered  unserviceable.    Report  to  OO-ALC/MMWR,  Hill  AFB,  UT 840565609.      Note:  Converted markers will not perform as reliably in fresh water as unconverted markers in seawater.  (T-2)   226  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 Figure 19.5.  Rescue Lanyard.  TOD D.

Infil/Exfil  Procedures.    Use  this  guidance  when  conducting  infil/exfil  operations.  These procedures are only authorized when conducting infil/exfil operations with dedicated unconventional forces and foreign counterparts.  All personnel in the cargo compartment will be seated and secured except those crew members having valid duties to perform.  (T-2) A2.1.1.1.  Rapid  Infiltration  (“Rapids”).    Rapids  are  a  tactical  method  of  onloading  or off-  loading  dedicated  unconventional  and  Special  Operations  Forces.    Spring-loaded, latch-activated,  folding  ramps  (canary  slides),  or  ground  loading  ramps  are  used  to offload  and  onload  vehicles,  personnel,  and  H-6  series  helicopters  in  minimal  time.  Selection of the onload/offload point and aircraft orientation impacts total ground times.  Extensive premission planning/static load training may be required for large or complex loads.    Exception:    Group  commander/COMAFSOF  (for  contingency  operations)  may authorize Rapid Infil/Exfil procedures and floor loading with non-SOF personnel to meet unit training requirements. A2.1.2.  Preparation.  Prepare aircraft for Infil/Exfil IAW TO 1C-130(M)J-9. A2.1.3.  Loadmaster Preflight: A2.1.3.1.  Blackout  covers  should  be  in  place  for  all  missions  flown  in  a  hostile environment at night. A2.1.3.2.  Chemical lights will be attached to each emergency exit handle.  Apply tape to allow a small amount of light to shine through.  (T-2) A2.1.3.3.  Emergency exit lights will be armed/off (as required).  (T-2) A2.1.3.4.  Cargo compartment lights will be set (as required).  (T-2) A2.1.3.5.  Door warning lights will be taped (as required).  (T-2) A2.1.3.6.  Turn off cargo floor, crew entrance door, and nose gear inspection lights. A2.1.3.7.  Jump lights will be taped (as required).  (T-2) A2.1.4.  Approved Deviations.  Personnel inside vehicles will be properly secured either with vehicle  seat  belts  or  personnel  restraining  devices  (e.g.,  Swiss  Seats)  for  takeoffs  and landings.  Do not exceed maximum vehicle gross weights.  All other personnel in the cargo compartment will be seated and secured using personnel restraint device or passenger combat loading procedures.  Crew members with valid duties (such as scanning) to perform are not required to be seated.  (T-2)    Note:  Users will provide their own personal restraint device.  If  user  does  not  provide  their  own  restraining  devices,  secure  personnel  using  passenger combat loading procedures.  (T-2) A2.1.4.1.  Loadmasters.  Loadmasters are normally positioned in the paratroop door and secured in a troop door seat or with a modified restraint belt or Swiss Seat for takeoff and landings when using infil/exfil procedures.   250  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 A2.1.4.2.  Drivers.  All vehicle drivers will wear NVGs when driving vehicles on or off the aircraft under blacked-out conditions or when cargo compartment EL/NVG lighting is in  use.   If a vehicle driver does not  have NVGs, the vehicle will be pushed or winched on/off the aircraft.  (T-2) A2.1.4.3.  Aerial Delivery System (ADS).  ADS arms will be disconnected/disengaged at the 10- minute warning.  Reconnect/reengage ADS arms after takeoff as soon as mission requirements permit.   (T-2)     Note:   If airdrop  operations are to  be conducted over the ramp after the ADS arms have been disconnected/disengaged, loadmasters will check the ramp/door  in  the  ADS  position  (to  facilitate  checking  the  ADS/no-go  light)  prior  to taking off/departure, if mission requirements allow.  (T-2) A2.1.4.4.  Ramps.    Canary  slide  ramps  or  auxiliary  ground  loading  ramps  may  be installed  in-flight  and  remain  installed  during  all  phases  of  flight.        Note:    It  may  be impossible to remove the auxiliary ground loading ramps from the outboard fittings with the  ramp  rails  installed  and  the  ramp  on  the  ground.    If  this  occurs,  raise  the  ramp  to horizontal to remove the loading ramps. A2.1.5.  Prohibited Actions. A2.1.5.1.  Open  carriage  vehicles  such  as:    quads,  mules  (6-wheeler),  motorcycles,  and mini- bikes will not allow drivers on vehicles for takeoffs and landings.  (T-2) A2.1.5.2.  Personnel will not be inside helicopters for takeoff or landings.  (T-2) A2.1.5.3.  For loads that have an item restrained to both the cargo floor and cargo ramp, open only the cargo door until the aircraft comes to a complete stop.  The cargo ramp will not be lowered until the aircraft arrives at the offload point and all restraints are removed.  (T-2) A2.1.5.4.  Vehicles  will  not  be  started  in-flight.    (T-2)        CAUTION:    To  prevent  the possibility of carburetor vapor-lock, vehicles will not be started in- flight. A2.1.5.5.  The cargo ramp will not be lowered below horizontal until the aircraft comes to a complete stop at the offload point.  (T-2) A2.1.5.6.  Vehicles will not be onloaded/offloaded while the center anchor cable supports are in the installed position.  (T-2) A2.1.5.7.  Vehicle IR lights will not be used in or around aircraft.  (T-2) A2.1.5.8.  Personnel will not loiter between vehicles while on the aircraft.  (T-2) A2.1.5.9.  Personnel will not sit or extend arms or legs under vehicles.  (T-2) A2.1.5.10.  Chemical lights attached to side escape hatch/crew entrance door handle will not be removed in-flight at any time.  (T-2) A2.1.6.  Ordnance Procedures. A2.1.6.1.  2.75-inch  rockets  and  other  missile-type  arms  may  be  taken  out  of  shipping containers and shipping tubes.  Safety rings must remain attached.  They may be secured in the vehicle for storage or maintained by the user.  (T-2) AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   251  A2.1.6.2.  Machine  gun/Gatling  gun  ammunition  may  be  kept  readily  available  but  will not be breached (chambered) until exiting the aircraft.  (T-2) A2.1.6.3.  Troops may maintain their own small arms ammunition, but weapons will not be breached (chambered) until exiting the aircraft.  (T-2) A2.1.6.4.  All weapons will be cleared and on SAFE with muzzles pointing down prior to boarding the aircraft.  (T-2) A2.1.7.  Fuel Limitations. A2.1.7.1.  Vehicle  fuel  tanks  will  not  exceed  75%  full  when  positioned  on  the  cargo  floor.  Fuel tanks for vehicles transported on the cargo ramp will not exceed 50% full.  (T-2) A2.1.7.2.  The H-6 series helicopters’ main and auxiliary tanks will not exceed 75% full.  (T-2) A2.1.7.3.  Spare gas cans (DOT 5L, jerry type) must have serviceable rubber gaskets in place and be secured inside the vehicle.  (T-2)    Exception:  Some types of vehicles provide for the  storage  of  spare  fuel  cans  outside  of  the  vehicle.    They  will  be  secured  to  prevent puncture  in  the  event  of  contact  with  the  aircraft  or  another  vehicle).    In  all  cases,  do  not place fuel cans on the front or rear bumpers.  Spare gas cans may be filled to their capacity.  If  placed  on  the  aircraft  floor,  metal-to-metal  contact  is  not  allowed.    (T-2)        Note:    Total combined fuel quantity for a vehicle and DOT 5L jerry cans cannot exceed twice the vehicle fuel tank capacity. A2.1.8.  Aircraft Configuration.  See AFI 11-2MC-130J, Vol 3, and Addenda A as required.  Note:  Due to the unique requirements needed to perform infiltration/exfiltration procedures sound  judgment  and  coordination  with  user  personnel  will  dictate  specific  aircraft configuration beyond the basic aircraft configurations.  (T-2) A2.1.8.1.  Cargo  ramp  and  minimum  necessary  canary  slides/ground  loading  ramps should  be  left  extended  until  the  latest  possible  time  to  facilitate  bump  plans  at  the intermediate staging base (ISB). A2.1.9.  General Considerations. A2.1.9.1.  Tape  chemical  lights  to  emergency  exit  handles  to  allow  a  small  amount  of light  to  shine  through.        WARNING:    Chemical  lights  attached  to  exit  doors  and emergency escape hatch handles will remain in place until mission completion.  (T-2) A2.1.9.2.  Tape may be used on the cargo compartment floor and tie-down rings to mark vehicle  locations  and  tie-down  points  for  exfil  operations.        Note:    Tape  is  usually installed at the ISB during static loading for exfil operations. A2.1.9.3.  Tying  pairs  of  auxiliary  ground  loading  ramps  together  with  1/2-inch  tubular nylon or 550 cord can expedite closing operations. A2.1.9.4.  The following are considerations for H-6 series helicopters. A2.1.9.5.  Remove  paratroop  door  jump  platforms  to  prevent  the  tail/tail  rotor  from contacting them on rapid onload/offload operations. A2.1.9.6.  If  dual  rails  are  unable  to  be  removed  from  the  aircraft  due  to  short  notice tasking/mission requirements, up to three H-6 series helicopters may be loaded safely (if   252  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 not  equipped  with  modified  tail  boom).    Extreme  caution  is  needed  during  loading  to ensure  the  tail/tail  rotor  of  the  last  aircraft  will  not  contact  the  cargo  door  and ramp/canary slides or ground loading ramps when in the closed position.  (T-2) A2.1.10.  Restraint  Requirements.    All  vehicles/helicopters  will  be  restrained  IAW  Table A2.1, Restraint Requirements.  (T-2) Table A2.1.  Restraint Requirements. Weight of Vehicle (pounds)  Restraint Required Less than 5,000 5,001 to 7,500 7,501 to 11,500 11,501 to 12,100 4 x 5,000-/10,000-pound straps (2 forward/2 aft) 6  x  5,000-pound  straps  (4  forward/2  aft)  or  4  x  10,000-pound straps/chains and devices (2 forward/2 aft) 6 x 10,000-pound straps/chains and devices (4 forward/2 aft) 10 x 10,000-pound straps/chains and devices (6 forward/4 aft) Note:    The  rapid  all-terrain  vehicle  (RATV)  will  be  restrained  using  a  minimum  of  six 5,000/10,000 pound tie-down straps (four forward and two aft).  The tie-down attachment points on the RATV are only rated at 5,000 pounds.  (T-2) A2.1.10.1.  Restrain  motorcycles  and  mini-bikes  with  one  5,000  pound  tie-down  strap each.    Restrain  quads  with  three  5,000  pound  tie-down  straps.    (The  vertical  strap centered over the seat will be left on during taxi, fwd and aft straps may be removed after 80 knot call).  (T-2) A2.1.10.2.  Motorcycle, quad and mini-bike restraint may be attached to a prepositioned chain connected to the aircraft sidewall tie-down rings. A2.1.10.3.  Restrain  H-6  series  helicopters  with  five  5,000  pound  tie-down  straps  (two forward, two aft, and one tail boom, or as identified by the user).   Note:  10,000 pound straps may be used in-lieu of the 5,000 pounds straps for H-6 series helicopters.  Users will provide straps when the 10,000 pound strap is  used.  (T-2)     WARNING:  Chains positioned  across  side  emergency  exits  will  be  connected  to  the  sidewall  tie-down  ring with a tie-down device to expedite removal in case of emergency egress.  (T-2) A2.1.10.4.  Leave approximately 24 inches of slack in the excess portion of the tie-down strap if possible.  After the vehicle is restrained, the excess strap will be rolled and taped.  Do not tape the excess portion to the taut side of the strap.  Exception:  The 5,000 pound straps used to tie-down H-6 series helicopters will have slack folded and taped to the taut side of the strap with enough slack to allow removal/installation.  (T-2) A2.1.11.  Static Load Training.  Conduct static load training prior to all infil/exfil operations.  Conduct  static  load  training  during  daylight  (or  white  lights),  blacked-out,  and  high  noise environments (e.g., APU, cheek rack blowers).  For training, conduct static load training to your situation (e.g., day rapids only require day static load training).     Note:  Ensure vehicle and passenger configuration/load sequence is thoroughly validated by user and loadmaster. AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   253  A2.1.11.1.  Generation  IV  ground  loading  ramps/bi-fold  ramps  (canary  slides)  will  be used.    Canary  slide  ramps  are  primary  for  helicopter  onload/offload  but  facilitate on/offloading  for  all  types  of  cargo.    During  helicopter  onload  use  a  full  set  of  canary slides  or  five  ground  loading  ramps  if  canary  slides  are  not  available.    Five  auxiliary ground  loading  ramps  or  three  canary  slide  ramps  will  be  used  unless  mission requirements  allow  fewer  numbers  to  be  used.    (See  TO 13C10-8-1  for  limitations  and preflight inspection requirements.)  (T-2) A2.1.11.2.  Install/stow ramps using a minimum of two people. A2.1.11.3.  Ramp  intermediate  roller  conveyors  should  not  be  installed  when  canary slides are being used. A2.1.11.4.  Ensure canary slides do not contact the cargo door during opening or closing. A2.1.11.5.  Secure  installed  ramps  with  1,000  pound  tubular  nylon  (or  suitable substitute), route through cable guides (canary slide ramps) or through structural member (auxiliary ground loading ramps) to ramp tie-down rings. A2.1.11.6.  The  loadmaster  will  notify  personnel  at  60,  30,  20,  10,  6,  1  minute(s),  and immediately  prior  to  landing.    The  1  minute  will  be  initiated  when  the  CSO  calls  “2 MILES”  or  “EXPECT  DESCENT  IN  1  MILE.”  Give  a  “PREPARE  TO  LAND”  call when the CSO calls “MINIMUMS” or “100 FEET ABOVE TOUCHDOWN.” (See TO 1C-130(M)J-1 for expanded infil/exfil checklist.) (T-2) A2.1.12.  Aircraft Egress, Familiarization, and Destruction Training. A2.1.12.1.  Aircraft  egress,  familiarization,  and  destruction  training  will  be  conducted with  the  user  participating  in  infil/exfil  operations.    This  training  is  mandatory  for  all personnel  prior  to  the  mission  and  will  be  conducted  during  static  load  training.    The aircraft  loadmasters  are  responsible  for  conducting  this  training  on  their  aircraft.    (T-2)   Note:  In cases where the crew which performed static load/egress training does not fly the  mission,  another  crew  from  the  same  MDS  may  execute  the  mission,  provided  a detailed face-to- face briefing is conducted prior to execution with the original crew and the user. A2.1.12.2.  Egress  drills  will  be  conducted  during  static  load  training.    They  will  be conducted  during  daylight  (or  white  light)  and  blacked-out/minimum  EL/NVG  lighting conditions.  (T-2) A2.1.12.3.  All  user  personnel  will  practice  the  use  of  emergency  exits  and  equipment.  (T-2)      CAUTION:    When  demonstrating  the  use  of  overhead  emergency  exits,  ensure user personnel are fully briefed on equipment that may be damaged during egress. A2.1.13.  Offload Operations. A2.1.13.1.  Vehicles will be backed onto  the aircraft.   Park vehicles in  lowest  gear  (neutral for diesel powered).  Put automatic vehicles in park.  (T-2) A2.1.13.2.  Loadmasters  will commander/departure airfield controlling officer (DACO).  (T-2) time  warnings/advisories pass to the troop A2.1.13.3.  All personnel will prepare for landing at the 6-minute advisory.  (T-2)   254  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 A2.1.13.4.  A  loadmaster  will  remain  on  headset  at  all  times  (normally  the  left  side loadmaster).  (T-2) A2.1.13.5.  Loadmasters will use NVGs for all infil/exfil operations.  (T-2) A2.1.13.6.  Cargo  compartment  EL/NVG  lighting  will  be  adjusted  to  the  minimum setting required at  the 6-minute advisory.   Aircraft not  equipped with  EL/NVG lighting will turn the red lights off at the 6-minute advisory.  Do not turn off/readjust lights until the  troop  commander/DACO  confirms  checks  are  complete.    (T-2)      Note:    EL/NVG lighting may be adjusted to minimum setting prior to the 6-minute advisory, provided the user is notified. A2.1.13.7.  User personnel will initiate their “80-knot” procedures upon hearing the “80-KNOT” call or when the aircraft ramp and door start to open.  (T-2) A2.1.13.8.  All  restraint  devices  except  one  forward  and  one  aft  (opposite  corners)  may be removed during taxi to the offload point (one strap over seat for motorcycles, quads, and mini- bikes will remain installed).  Self-propelled vehicles must have drivers in place with  brakes  set  prior  to  removing  restraints.    Exception:    All  restraints  will  remain  on helicopters except for the tail boom until the aircraft has come to a complete stop.  (T-2) A2.1.13.9.  Do not position the cargo ramp below horizontal until the aircraft comes to a complete  stop  at  the  offload  point.    For  areas  where  ground  threats  or  mission requirements dictate minimum time on the ground, the loadmaster and the AC will brief a countdown  for  movement  of  the  ramp  below  horizontal.    Caution  must  be  exercised  to ensure the ramp does not contact the ground before the aircraft stops.  (T-2) A2.1.13.10.  Do  not  deploy  canary  slides/ground  loading  ramps  until  the  ramp  is positioned below horizontal and the aircraft has stopped. A2.1.13.11.  Clearance  to  offload:    A  loadmaster  will  be  positioned  on  the  vehicle driver’s side of the cargo ramp  and raise both  arms  to  signal  clearance to offload.   The loadmaster will drop both arms to signal vehicle drivers to halt offload operations.  (T-2) A2.1.13.12.  Offload vehicles and personnel as trained during statics. A2.1.13.13.  Clear a stalled vehicle immediately to the aircraft right (engines 3 and 4) or as static trained to allow the offload to continue.     Note:  If a time delay occurs before onloading/departure, turn off all EL/NVG lighting  and raise the ramp  approximately 12 inches to allow the aircraft to be taxied in the event of an emergency. A2.1.14.  Onload Operations. A2.1.14.1.  A  loadmaster  will  remain  on  headset  at  all  times  (normally  the  left  side loadmaster).  (T-2) A2.1.14.2.  Loadmasters will use NVGs for all infil/exfil operations.  (T-2) A2.1.14.3.  EL/NVG lighting will be adjusted as required for the onload.  (T-2) A2.1.14.4.  A  loadmaster  will  be  positioned  on  the  vehicle  driver’s  side  of  the  cargo ramp.  The loadmaster will advise the troop commander/DACO when ready for loading.  The troop commander/DACO will not clear personnel or vehicles to load until cleared by the loadmaster.  (T-2) AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   255  A2.1.14.5.  A  loadmaster  will  be  in  the  cargo  compartment  to  marshal  vehicles  into position with IR chem-lights.  (T-2) A2.1.14.6.  Load vehicles and personnel as trained during statics. A2.1.14.7.  The loadmaster will coordinate with the troop commander/DACO to confirm all personnel and equipment are onboard and the onload is complete.  (T-2) A2.1.14.8.  When  the  loadmaster  has  determined  sufficient  restraint  has  been  applied  to the load, (minimum of one forward and one aft) and it is safe to do so, the loadmaster will advise the crew “CLEAR TO TAXI.” Once the ramp and door are closed and locked, the cargo compartment  EL/NVG lights may be turned to the maximum setting (if required).  After  all  cargo  and  personnel  restraint  is  checked,  the  loadmaster  will  advise  the  crew “SECURE.” (T-2)    256  AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015 Attachment 3 COMBAT OFFLOAD PROCEDURES A3.1.  The method of combat offload will be determined by the aircrew based on the conditions at the offload site.  (T-2) A3.2.  Cargo pallets, airdrop platforms, and CDS containers can be offloaded without damage to the  aircraft  with  the  cargo  ramp  in  the  horizontal  position.    Use  the  following  methods  for combat offload operations. A3.2.1.  Method  A.    Use  this  method  to  offload  single,  multiple,  ramp  or  married  pallets, airdrop  platforms,  and  CDS  containers.    Pallets,  platforms,  or  CDS  may  be  offloaded  in  a train like fashion or one-by-one as the situation dictates.    Note:  When quickly offloading fragile items  (such as computers), loadmasters may install ground loading ramps  and lower the  ramp  to  a  position  approximately  18  inches  above  the  ground  to  lessen  the  chances  of damage.  As a technique, loadmasters can restrain the load with a drift strap while the pilot slowly taxis from underneath the load.     WARNING:  Many explosive items have specific "drop" criteria that, if exceeded, render the item useless or dangerous to the user.  With the exception  of  small  arms  ammunition  (hazard  class  and  division  1.4),  explosives  and munitions shall not be combat offloaded without approval of MAJCOM/A3.      Exception:  Explosives and munitions rigged for airdrop may be combat offloaded without MAJCOM/A3 approval.    CAUTION:  A taxiway or ramp at least 500 feet long is required; however, 1,000 feet  is  desired  to  provide  a  margin  of  safety.    When  pallets,  platforms,  or  containers  are offloaded one at a time, use a longer taxiway based on the number to be offloaded. A3.2.1.1.  Single or double/triple married pallets may be offloaded, without ballast, using this method provided their weight does not exceed 12,000 pounds, and the height of the pallets fall within cargo height jettison limit in section III of the flight manual or Chapter 5 of the cargo loading manual. A3.2.1.2.  Airdrop  rigged  platforms  up  to  24  feet  in  length  may  be  offloaded,  without ballast, using this method provided their weight does not exceed 12,000 pounds.    Note:  Single  or  married  pallets  and  airdrop  rigged  platforms  over  12,000  pounds  may  be  off- loaded  using  this  method,  provided  ballast  or  cargo  equal  to  the  difference  between 12,000 pounds and the weight of the pallets or platforms (to be offloaded) remains in C through F compartments during offload.   EXAMPLE:  A 17,000 pound married pallet or airdrop  platform  requires  5,000  pounds  of  ballast  or  cargo  to  remain  in  C  through  F compartments during the offload. A3.2.1.3.  CDS  bundles  may  be  combat  offloaded  using  this  method.    The  static  line retriever will be used via manual activation; manual gate cut may be done if the retriever is  inoperative.  With  the  Centerline  Vertical  Restraint  (CVR),  offload  must  be accomplished one side at a time if the total bundle weight exceeds 12,000 pounds.  Non-CVR  single  stick  may  be  offloaded  if  the  total  weight  is  less  than  12,000  pounds.  Without  the  CVR,  if  the  total  weight  of  the  bundles  exceeds  12,000  pounds,  bundles should be restrained in groups of four or less and offloaded one group at a time.  For the unplanned combat offload of non-CVR bundles, restrain the bundles as described above.  Perform an initial offload via the static line retriever, and on sequential off- load remove aft restraint before clearing the pilot to taxi.  Consider the slope of the offload site, which AFI11-2MC-130JV3  29 APRIL 2015   257  may  cause  bundles  to  roll  aft  upon  removal  of  restraint.    (T-2)            CAUTION:    When using method "A" on excessively rough, sharply undulating, or battle- damaged surfaces, damage to the aircraft ramp may occur.  Reducing forward taxi speed on these surfaces will  reduce  aircraft  oscillation.    The  PIC  must  determine  if  the  offload  area  will  permit the offload operation to be conducted without damage to the aircraft or equipment.  (T-2) A3.2.2.  Method B.  Use this method to offload married pallets that do not fit the category for method A or for which no ballast is available for married pallets weighing between 12,000 to 15,000 pounds.  Use four serviceable steel 55-gallon drums under each pallet to be offloaded.  The correct number of steel drums needed to complete this type of offload must be available at  the  offload  site  or  must  accompany  the  load  when  conditions  at  the  offload  site  are unknown.  (T2)      WARNING:  The maximum weight for pallets to be offloaded across the ramp at any one time when using method B is 15,000 lbs.     WARNING:  Do not use method B  for  airdrop-rigged  platforms  to  prevent  binding  the  platform  under  the  vertical  restraint rails. A3.2.3.  Aircrew Procedures: A3.2.3.1.  Prior to commencing combat offload operations, the pilot will brief each crew member  on  the  method  to  be  used.    Specific  procedures  are  in  the  expanded  checklist.  (T-2) A3.2.3.2.  All  crew  members  participating  in  the  offload  will  refer  to  the  checklist.  Report any problem to the pilot immediately.  (T-2) A3.2.3.3.
