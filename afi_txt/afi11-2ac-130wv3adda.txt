General.  This  instruction  establishes  basic  cargo  compartment  configuration,  standard equipment, and its location aboard the AC-130W aircraft.  Those who use this instruction should bear in mind that an infinite number of variations are available and that the cargo compartment configurations listed here are the most typical encountered day-to-day. 1.2.  Responsibilities.  Personnel  engaged  in  planning  operations  must  consider  the  most appropriate configuration that will satisfy mission requirements and permit minimum variations and  man-hours  to  change.    Units  performing  services  on  the  AC-130W  aircraft  (e.g., maintenance,  Aircrew  Flight  Equipment  (AFE)  personnel)  are  responsible  for  configuring  the aircraft in accordance with (IAW) this instruction and as outlined in mission directives to include the  stowage/installation  of  equipment  IAW  the  configuration  and  equipment  tables  outlined herein.  (T-2) 1.3.  Codes.  Use  the  following  codes  when  referring  to  AC-130W  cargo  compartment configuration.  The letter code will be followed by a number identifying configuration capability.  (T-2) 1.3.1.  AE – Aero-medical Evacuation. 1.3.2.  C – Cargo. 1.3.3.  CP – Cargo and Passengers. 1.3.4.  P – Passenger. 1.4.  Modifications.  The coded configurations of this regulation may require modification for a specific  mission.    Each  modification  must  be  carefully  evaluated  prior  to  mission  execution  to ensure maximum flight safety and compatibility with aircraft equipment.  Each mission directive will identify the basic configuration by code and the modification, if necessary, to satisfy mission requirements.  For example, a cargo mission may require additional seats or equipment such as a bulldog winch not in the C-cargo configuration.  Indicate the mission directive configuration C (number as applicable) and modification, e.g., two additional seats and bulldog winch required.  (T2) 1.5.  Weight and Balance. 1.5.1.  Configuration  and  necessary  equipment  changes  to  conduct  special  operations missions  affect  the  weight  and  balance  of  the  aircraft.    To  standardize  equipment  and  the location of equipment, items shown in Table 2.1 will be included in the basic weight of the aircraft  and  remain  on  the  aircraft  except  for  maintenance,  inspection  and  when  removal  is directed by this Air Force Instruction (AFI) Equipment listed in Table 2.2, will be added as necessary and entered on DD Form 365-4, Weight and Balance Clearance Form F, reference 5, 6, or 7.  For simplicity the aerial gunner will (when preparing the DD Form 365-4) enter the weight contained in the equipment tables for the applicable configuration.  Adjustments will be made when the actual on-board weight of an item varies from data shown.  DD Form 365-4 will be completed IAW instructions in Chapter 5.  (T-2) AFI11-2AC-130WV3ADDA  23 APRIL 2015   5  1.5.2.  When a configuration change that removes items listed in Table 2.1 is accomplished at a Forward Operating Location and no Quality Assurance (QA) branch weight and balance authority is deployed to the location, maintenance personnel will put an info note in the Air Force Technical Order (AFTO) Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document indicating the weight, fuselage station and moment of any equipment added or removed.  The aerial gunner will add or subtract the listed weight and moment from the last entry in the DD Form  365-3,  Chart  C,  Basic  Weight  and  Balance  Record.    Annotate  the  new  weight  and moment  in  Block  1  of  DD  365-4.    Configuration  changes  accomplished  at  home  station require a QA update to the DD Form 365-3, Chart C.  (T-2)  Exception:  Minor equipment changes after crew reporting may be annotated on the DD Form 365-4, by the aerial gunner. 1.6.  Distribution.  Commanders are responsible for bringing this publication to the attention of all affected personnel.  At least one copy will be maintained in the unit operations section.  It will be  readily  accessible  to  operations  and  aircrew  personnel.    Additional  distribution  will  be  as follows:  (T-2) 1.6.1.  Staff operations, all levels. 1.6.2.  All levels of aircrew standardization offices. 1.6.3.  Aircraft maintenance squadrons/units, Dash 21 equipment sections, Quality Assurance sections. 1.6.4.  AFE sections. 1.6.5.  One located in the supplemental weight and balance handbook binder on each aircraft. 1.7.  Revisions.  All  revisions  will  consist  of  electronic  interim  change  or  new  publication.  Personnel at all echelons are encouraged to make recommendations to improve this instruction.  Direct  proposed  changes  to  AFSOC/A3V  in  accordance  with  AFI  11-202,  Vol  2,    Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation  Program,  and  AFI  11-215,  USAF  Flight  Manual  Program.    Use AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication.  (T-2) 1.8.  Supplements.  Subordinate  unit  supplements  to  this  instruction  that  change  the  basic policies,  procedures,  or  formats  prescribed  herein  are  prohibited.    Exception:    Groups  may supplement  Table  2.2  with  additional  items.    They  may  also  supplement  Chapter  3  with specified  configuration  modifications  to  accommodate  theater  unique  requirements.    Forward supplements to Headquarters (HQ) AFSOC/A3V for approval.  (T-2) 1.9.  Aircrew  Flight  Equipment  Requirements.

When the load consists of palletized netted cargo or is secured with straps, maintain a 30-inch space between cargo and the nearest  forward litter, occupied seat  or nuclear  cargo.  When cargo, either palletized or non-palletized, is secured with chains, 30-inch spacing is not required.  (T-2)    Exception:  Always maintain the 30-inch spacing on AE missions, when carrying litters.  (T-2) 3.2.  Legend of Configurations.  These configurations are the most common, but may be altered to  meet  mission  requirements.    If  all  weapon  systems  are  removed  from  the  aircraft  (i.e.,  Gun Pallet  and  MOP  are  removed)  individuals  responsible  for  configuring  the  cargo  compartment may refer to AFI 11-2MC-130, Vol 3, Addenda B, MC-130H Operation Configuration/Mission Planning,  for  additional  configuration  options.    The  configurations  contained  in  AFI  11-2MC-130, Vol 3, Addenda B may be restricted due to availability of cargo compartment equipment. 3.2.1.  AE-1.

Emergency  Exits  and  Safety  Aisles.  Load  aircraft  in  such  a  manner  that  the  following emergency exits and safety aisles are available.  (T-2) 4.2.1.  At least one cabin emergency exit is unobstructed.  (T-2) 4.2.2.  At least one unobstructed emergency exit is available for each 20 personnel on-board.  This does not restrict overwater flights if the three overhead escape hatches are available for egress.    Litters  and  seats  erected  across  an  emergency  exit  are  not  considered  as  an obstruction.  (T-2) 4.2.3.  When passengers are being airlifted, an unobstructed aisle way will be maintained in the wheel-well, next to the aft right cheek rack (pallet positions 3 & 4) and ramp area (pallet position 6) to provide access to emergency exits.  In the wheel-well area the aisle way will be a minimum of 14 inches wide between the outer edge of the cargo and the aircraft and  will begin at the cargo floor Figure  4.1  A.  Tie-down equipment (463L nets, straps, chains, and devices) shall not normally be considered an obstruction.  The aisle way will be on the right side of the aircraft due to MOP installation.  If the aisle way is placed on the right side of the aircraft,  then  clearance  to  the  right  side  of  the  aircraft  must  be  maintained.    The  dual  rail outboard frame provides 8 inches of the 14 inch requirement on the main cargo floor.  In the ramp area the aisle way will be a minimum of 8 inches beginning at the outboard edge of the dual rail frame.  Access to aft latrine facilities requires an 18-inch clear area on the forward right side of the cargo loaded on the ramp.  (T-2) 4.2.4.  If  safety  aisle  requirements  in  Paragraph  4.2.3  cannot  be  achieved  on  missions carrying  crew  only  or  mission  essential  personnel  authorized  by  operations  order/plan  or COMAFSOF,  then  a  safety  aisle  will  be  maintained  in  the  wheel-well  area  to  provide  the following minimum clearance (Figure 4.1 B).  (T-2) 4.2.4.1.  At least 14 inches between the outer edge of the cargo and the aircraft beginning no higher than 36 inches above the floor/pallet/platform. 4.2.4.2.  Or a minimum of 30 inches between the outer edge of the cargo and the aircraft beginning no higher than 60 inches above the floor/pallet/platform. 4.2.5.  During  all  missions,  aerial  gunners  shall  have  access  to  the  rear  of  the  aircraft  to accomplish checklists.  (T-2) 4.2.6.  On all missions, cargo will be loaded in such a way that the crew will have access to the rear of the aircraft.  The Aircraft Commander will be the final authority for determining if safety aisles and/or access aft of cargo are adequate.  Cargo loads in  Chapter  6 of TO 1C-130A-9 are specific and do not require a waiver.  (T-2) AFI11-2AC-130WV3ADDA  23 APRIL 2015   19  Figure 4.1.

Introduction.  This  chapter  provides  instructions  for  computation  and  completion  of DD Form  365-4  Form  F.    The  Form  F  will  be  computed  using  simplified  moments.    The transport or tactical side of the Form F may be used.  (T-2) 5.2.  Load Planning.  The cargo/ammunition load must be planned so that the center of gravity of the loaded aircraft will be within the specified forward and aft limits for any given operating condition.  Consideration must be given to offload sequence, aircraft limitations, and emergency jettisoning.  (T-2) 5.3.  General Instructions.  These instructions apply to forms using simplified moments, entries on the form may be either typed or handwritten.  Approved computer generated Form Fs are also authorized (Automated Form F (AFF) or approved Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) programs). 5.3.1.  DD  Form  365-4  Heading.    Enter  date,  mission  number,  aircraft  type,  serial  number, departure and destination station (name or International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) identifier), aircraft’s home station and pilot's rank and last name.  (T-2) 5.3.2.  Limitations Column.  Enter appropriate weight and Center of Gravity (CG) limits for the planned mission using the following criteria:  The maximum gross weight and CG limits specified  in  TO   1C-130(A)W-1,  Flight  Manual  AC-130W,  will  not  be  exceeded.    Gross weight  may  also  be limited by operating conditions ( i.e., obstacle  clearance, rate of climb, weather  conditions,  altitude,  runway/taxi-way  bearing  capacity,  or  any  other  published restrictions).    The  pilot/flight  engineer  will  inform  the  aerial  gunner  of  any  gross  weight restrictions  prior  to  the  mission  so  an  accurate  Allowable  Cabin  Load  (ACL)  may  be obtained.  (T-2) 5.3.2.1.  Takeoff  ACL  (Transport  Form  F).    Unless  other  restrictions  are  imposed,  use 155,000  allowable  gross  weight  for  AC-130W  aircraft,  and  subtract  the  total  aircraft weight (Reference 12).  (T-2) 5.3.2.2.  Landing  ACL  (Transport  Form  F).    Unless  other  landing  restrictions  are imposed,  use  155,000  for  AC-130W  aircraft,  and  subtract  operating  weight  plus estimated landing fuel (references 9 and 23).  (T-2) 5.3.2.3.  Limiting  Wing  Fuel  (Transport  Form  F).    Compute  IAW  limiting  wing  fuel charts in Table 5.1 of this instruction or the charts in section V of TO 1C-130(A)W-1 for takeoff and landing.  The most restrictive weight will be used.  (T-2)            Note:  The limiting wing fuel chart in this instruction is based on a 2.5 G maneuver load factor with indicated airspeed restrictions outlined in area "C" of the flight manual limiting wing fuel charts.  When specific  mission requirements exceed the limitations outlined in  area  "C" of  the  limiting  wing  fuel  charts,  the  aerial  gunner  must  compute  limitations  using  the appropriate  flight  manual  limiting  wing  fuel  chart  in  section  V  of  TO  1C-130(A)W-1.  (T-2)          Note:  Enter the allowable gross weight for limiting wing fuel and subtract the operating weight to determine limiting wing fuel allowable cabin load (ACL).   24  AFI11-2AC-130WV3ADDA  23 APRIL 2015 5.3.2.4.  Permissible  CG  Takeoff  and  Landing.

Enter  landing  fuel  weight  and  moment  obtained  by  determining estimated fuel in all tanks for landing.  Refer to Paragraph 5.4.1.2 or 5.4.1.3.  Calculate fuel moments  using  fuel  tables  in  TO  1C-130(M)W-5  Figure  3.3  or  by  multiplying  total estimated wing fuel on board by 0.552.  (T-2) 5.6.15.  Reference 16.  Determine the estimated landing condition by subtracting the fuel and expendables weight and moment of reference 14 from the takeoff condition (reference 9 or 12), then adding reference 15.  (T-2) 5.6.16.  Reference 17.  Enter landing CG in percent of MAC.  (T-2) 5.7.  Limiting  Wing  Fuel.  Table  5.1  may  be  used  to  determine  maximum  limiting  wing  fuel ACL  for  a  given  fuel  load  when  in  primary  fuel  management.    Comply  with  the  requirements outlined  in  Paragraph  5.7.1  when  using  Table  5.1.    Fuel  weights  are  expressed  in  thousands.  For  fuel  weights  between  chart  weights,  go  to  nearest  fuel  weight  to  determine  base  weight.  Both takeoff and landing conditions must be calculated.  The most restrictive will be placed on the DD-365-4, Weight and Balance Clearance Form F - Transport.  (T-2) 5.7.1.  Instructions  for  primary  fuel  management.    Table  5.1  is  based  on  the  recommended areas (Areas A, B, and C) of the Weight Limitations Chart (Primary Fuel Management) with Foam In Fuel Tanks in TO 1C-130(A)W-1, Section V.  For Operations that do not meet these criteria, use the appropriate chart in TO 1C-130(A)W-1, Section V.  (T-2) Table 5.1.  Limiting Wing Fuel Primary Fuel.
