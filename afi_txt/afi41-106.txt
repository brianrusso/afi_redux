Mission Overview. 1.1.1.  The  Air  Force  Medical  Service  (AFMS)  provides  seamless  health  service  support  to AF  and  Combatant  Commanders  (CCDR)  and  assists  in  sustaining  the  performance,  health and  fitness  of  every  Airman  in-garrison  and  while  deployed  within  the  Continental  United States (CONUS) or overseas (OCONUS) in support of global operations.  This capability is summarized  by  the  phrase  “global  medical  readiness”  which  includes  the  full  spectrum  of medical  operations  (expeditionary  deployment  operations,  humanitarian  assistance,  all-hazards response, and global health engagement to support building partnerships and stability operations).    It  also  includes  the  necessary  planning,  training,  and  readiness  support functions, such as readiness reporting, associated with these operations.  Components of this global system are fully integrated, with forward-deployed health services, and en-route care to facilities providing comprehensive, definitive medical specialty care. 1.1.2.  The  foundational  emphasis  is  on  prevention  of  illness  and  injury.    When  illness  or injury  does  occur,  the  AFMS  provides  a  rapidly  responding  modular  medical  capability, which can be tailored to meet specific requirements.  If more definitive care is required, the AF supports an effective “evacuate and replace” policy through aeromedical evacuation (AE) of joint and combined forces.  With this focus on preventive medicine, superior health care, and aeromedical  evacuation,  the AFMS promotes and advocates the optimization of human performance  sustainment  and  enhancement,  including  the  optimal  integration  of  human capabilities  with  operational  systems.    To  achieve  the  mission,  the  AFMS  developed processes  to  support  operational  strategies,  emergency  management,  medical  readiness training,  manpower  and  equipment  force  packaging,  medical  readiness  resourcing, aeromedical  evacuation  and  global  medical  operations  plans  and  reporting.    The  following sections will introduce these areas: 1.2.  Operational Strategies. 1.2.1.  The AFMS employs multiple planning strategies to ensure capabilities are organized, trained, equipped, and available to meet contingency requirements. 1.2.1.1.  Modular  Capabilities.    The  AFMS  provides  a  light,  lean,  modularized  medical capability that can be deployed rapidly to support operations overseas and at home. 1.2.1.2.  Most  initial  medical  support  begins  with  either  the  Global  Reach  Laydown (GRL) team or the Squadron Medical Element (SME).  The GRL unit type code (UTC) FFGRL  consists  of  four  personnel  and  is  assigned  to  the  Contingency  Response  Group (CRG)  to  provide  medical  support  during  rapid  opening  of  contingency  airfields.    The purpose of the CRG is to bring significant order, foresight, speed, and safety during the critical  opening  days  of  a  contingency.    The  SME  is  a  small  team  embedded  within  a Line of the AF (LAF) aviation unit, designed to provide aerospace medicine support to an AF flying squadron.  This team deploys with the squadron and provides care and initial preventive  medicine  surveillance.    As  support  to  the  expeditionary  squadron  grows,  the SME  can  be  augmented  with  additional  capabilities,  such  as  independent  duty  medical AFI41-106  9 JUNE 2017 7 technicians (IDMTs) and preventive aerospace medicine (PAM) teams.  The PAM team provides  aerospace  medicine  support  during  the  opening  of  a  contingency  airbase, including performing the GRL role described in this Instruction if that UTC is not tasked.  If the bed down site becomes a more permanent  operating site or the population  at  risk (PAR)  increases,  the  AFMS  can  deploy  the  Expeditionary  Medical  Support  (EMEDS) system.  The scalable nature of EMEDS allows the AF to deploy capabilities from small teams that can provide highly skilled medical care for a limited number of casualties, to a medical  system  as  large  as  an  Air  Force  Theater  Hospital  (AFTH)  that  can  provide specialized medical care to a PAR of several thousand. 1.2.1.3.  For casualties requiring more definitive care than that provided by the EMEDS, the  Global  Patient  Movement  System  can  provide  rapid  movement  of  patients  to  the appropriate  level  of  care.    As  a  component  of  the  USAF  Mobility  Air  Forces  (MAF) system, AE crews provide en-route medical care to stabilized patients during transport on MAF aircraft.  Critical Care Air Transport Teams (CCATTs) provide advanced specialty medical  capability  to  evacuate  critically  ill,  injured,  or  burned  patients  requiring continuous stabilization and advanced care during transport. 1.2.1.4.  These  modular  capabilities  are  organized  by  force  modules  to  complement increases  in  combat  capability.    As  a  bed  down  grows,  predetermined  support  assets, including  medical  assets,  are  deployed  to  that  location.    These  predetermined  modules provide  an  organized  expansion  capability,  offer  predictability  to  the  supporting  units, and simplify the planning process. 1.2.1.5.  In  addition  to  missions  associated  with  aircraft  bed  down  locations,  AFMS forces  may  deploy  in  support  of  stability  operations  to  build  partner  nation  governance and security capacity as well as provide humanitarian aid and disaster relief. 1.2.2.  Capabilities-based Planning.  The AF has shifted from a programs/platforms mentality to  capabilities-based  planning.    Commanders  and  their  planners  identify  requirements  for specific capabilities not for units, and those capabilities are then associated with trained and available  unit  type  codes  (UTCs).    In  order  to  quantify  capabilities,  the  Office  of  the Secretary  of  Defense  (OSD)  has  directed  that  all  Services  observe,  assess,  and  report  their units’ ability to perform through mission essential tasks (METs) measured against a specific standard. 1.2.3.  AFMS  Force  Presentation.    AFMS  personnel  assigned  to  warfighting  organizations are  placed  in  either  a  standard  deployable  UTC  or  an  associate  UTC  and  given  an  AEF assignment in  accordance with  the Medical  Resource  Letter (MRL) and  Medical  Readiness Decision Support System (MRDSS).  Personnel assigned to institutional force (IF) units (e.g. HAF, MAJCOM, training units) will have an AEF Indicator (AEFI) of X. 1.2.3.1.  UTC  assigned  medical  forces  are  presented  as  Health  Service  Support  (HSS) Demand  Force  Teams  (DFTs)  to  meet  CCDR  requirements  and/or  AF  missions.    AC capabilities  are  managed  at  a  minimum  1:2  deploy-to-dwell  ratio  and  ARC  capabilities are  managed  at  a  1:5  mobilization-to-dwell  ratio.    Medical  DFTs  are  presented  in  five categories, as described below, to provide the full range of HSS to deployed and in-place warfighters  and  enable  global  patient  movement  with  CCATTs  and  patient  staging capabilities. 8 AFI41-106  9 JUNE 2017 1.2.3.1.1.  Home  Station  Health  Service  Support  Teams  provide  and  enhance  a healthy and fit force including maintaining health/fitness of deployed in-place forces and restoring the physical and mental health of redeployed service members. 1.2.3.1.2.  Expeditionary Medical Support Teams provide rapidly deployable medical capability  for  forward  operating  locations  of  varying  sizes  in  support  of  an  Air Expeditionary Task Force or other contingency operations. 1.2.3.1.3.  Expeditionary En-route Care Teams provide patient movement capabilities and equipment in support of the global patient movement mission. 1.2.3.1.4.  Special  Operations  Medical  Support  Teams  provide  small,  highly  skilled, tactically trained medical  teams  that  utilize lean and tailored equipment  packages in support of US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) missions. 1.2.3.1.5.  The  National  Guard  Homeland  Response  Force/CBRNE  Enhanced Response Force Package (NG HRF/CERFP) provide unique military and civilian life saving capabilities and expertise to assist the Governors in responding to a CBRNE or other  mass  casualty  incident,  which  may  include  large  numbers  of  fatalities.    These NG  HRFs/CERFPs  can  be  available  24  hours  a  day,  7  days  a  week  for  regional  or national deployment for response operations.  Guidance for the HRF/CERFP mission can  be  found  in  NGR  500-4/ANGI  10-2504,  National  Guard  CBRNE  Enhanced Response  Force  Package  Management,  and  NGB  HRF/CERFP  Yearly  Guidance.  These  documents  prescribe  policies,  procedures,  training,  and  responsibilities governing  the  deployment  and  employment  of  HRF/CERFP  in  support  of  the National Guard Homeland Security mission. 1.2.3.2.  All  UTC  assigned  personnel  will  be  aligned  to  a  specified  HSS  DFT  and postured  in  AEF  vulnerability  periods  in  accordance  with  the  approved  AFMS Prioritization and Sequencing Guidance and the AFMS Medical Resource Letter (MRL). 1.2.4.  Constant  Deployer  Model  (CDM).    The  AFMS  supports  the  Air  and  Space Expeditionary  Force  (AEF)  strategy  and  ensures  personnel  are  postured  evenly  across  the AEF.  These deployable forces are mainly assigned to large medical treatment facilities using a CDM.  The model maximizes laydown of key teams at facilities most able to provide the complex  clinical  caseload  required  for  clinical  currency  while  simultaneously  providing sufficient  copies  of  a  UTC  to  support  each  AEF  vulnerability  period.    By  concentrating deployment  capability  at  large  facilities,  individuals  and  teams  are  able  to  leverage  their home-station  responsibilities  to  maintain  readiness  currency  in  individual  tasks,  and  to  a large  degree,  team  METs.    Additional  guidance  and  information  may  be  found  in  AFI  10-401,  Air  Force  Operations  Planning  and  Execution,  AEF  On-line  page,  and  the  AFMS Posturing and Sequencing Guide. 1.2.5.  Consultant  Balanced  Deployments  (CBD).    The  CBD  concept  ensures  AEF deployment  requirements  are  met  using  the  most  qualified  individuals  available  at  any  one time  from  across  the  AFMS  by  balancing  deployments  for  their  specialty,  primarily  those considered  critical  operational  readiness  Air  Force  Specialty  Codes  (AFSC).    Additionally, this concept limits interruptions to home station health care and maximizes individual career development and growth.  Refer to the AFMS Posturing and Sequencing (P&S) Guidance for additional information. AFI41-106  9 JUNE 2017 9 1.2.6.  Stability  Operations.    The  term  “stability  operations”  refers  to  various  military missions, tasks, and activities conducted outside the United States in coordination with other instruments of national power to maintain or reestablish a safe and secure environment, and provide  essential  government  services,  emergency  infrastructure  reconstruction,  and humanitarian relief.  The Air Force must be prepared to work with other Services to conduct stability  operations  throughout  all  phases  of  conflict  in  both  combat  and  non-combat environments.  Stability operations may be small or large scale, lasting for the short or long-term. 1.2.6.1.  Integrated  military  and  civilian  operations  are  essential  to  successful  stability operations;  consequently,  the  Air  Force  will  collaborate  with  other  Services  and  US governmental and nongovernmental organizations, and private sector firms  as directed to plan, prepare for and  conduct  stability  operations.    The  AFMS  has  a  critical  role  in  supporting  stability operations by providing essential medical services and providing humanitarian assistance. international  government agencies, foreign  governments, 1.2.6.2.  AF  medical  personnel  and  capabilities  must  be  prepared  to  meet  military  and civilian  health  requirements  in  medical  stability  operations.    To  meet  this  requirement, training will be provided to prepare personnel for stability operations in accordance with DoDI  3000.05,  Stability  Operations,  and  DoDI  6000.16,  Military  Health  Support  for Stability Operations. 1.2.7.  Joint  Interoperability.    The  AF  fights  jointly.    In  recent  years,  OSD  has  reinforced commitment to joint interoperability and joint training in most strategic planning and training documents.    This  commitment  is  seen  in  using  METs  for  training  and  expanding  training opportunities  through  the  use  of  joint  field  exercises  as  training  venues  for  AFMS  teams, when  appropriate.    Teams  that  are  likely  to  deploy  with  medical  teams  from  a  different Service, or in  direct  support of a joint  operation such as casualty staging  and CCATTs, are prime candidates for a joint exercise operation. 1.3.  Installation Medical Response. 1.3.1.  AF  fixed  medical  facilities  worldwide  plan  for  conducting  their  home  station  and expeditionary missions simultaneously.  Home station missions include protecting the airbase population, reducing harmful effects, assisting in the sustainment of critical missions, facility expansion, which can increase the bed capacity of some MTFs to receive and care for large numbers  of  casualties;  medical  surveillance;  Chemical,  Biological,  Radiological,  Nuclear (CBRN)  detection  and  analysis;  patient  decontamination;  and  medical  response/support  to contingencies  confined  to  the  installation  or  involving  Federal,  State,  Local,  or  Tribal agencies, or Host Nation governments, including CBRN incidents. 1.3.2.  The AFMS participates in the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) through Air Force  Federal  Coordinating  Centers  (FCCs).    AF  FCCs  are  designated  MTFs  that  are responsible for day-to-day coordination of planning and operations in one or more assigned geographic  NDMS  Patient  Reception  Areas  (PRA).    PRAs  are  designated  airfields  that provide adequate patient staging facilities, local patient transport assets, and patient reception and  transport  to  local  voluntary,  pre-identified,  non-federal,  acute  care  medical  facilities capable  of  providing  definitive  care  for  domestic  disaster  victims.    FCCs  also  serve  as Primary  Receiving  Centers  and  Secondary  Centers  capable  of  receiving,  treating,  holding, and  disbursing  military  patients  resulting  from  a  military  or  homeland  contingency.    In 10 AFI41-106  9 JUNE 2017 addition,  the  AFMS  provides  patient  staging  to  include  critical  care  staging  (through  a composite  capability  with  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services)  to  prospective evacuees  in  support  of  NDMS.    It  is  equipped  and  staffed  with  patient  care  and  support personnel for a throughput-planning factor of 140 patients in a 24-hour period per supported Aerial Port of Embarkation (APOE); a total of four (4) APOEs may be established for patient movement  operations.    Additional  information  on  NDMS  can  be  found  on  the  AF  Medical Readiness SharePoint Site. 1.3.3.  Air  National  Guard  medical  personnel  may  be  tasked  to  serve  at  the  Joint  Force Headquarters (JFHQ) Joint Operations Center as planners and liaison officers to provide state level Defense Support to Civil Authorities (DSCA).  To maintain a capability to respond to all  contingencies,  the  ANG  relies  on  highly  trained  medical  warriors  and  state-of-the-art, light, ruggedized medical equipment.  Comprehensive planning and realistic exercises ensure personnel are prepared to support globally integrated operations (GIO). 1.3.4.  Overarching  guidance  for  the  AF  emergency  response  program  and  the  AF  Incident Management  System  (AFIMS)  is  contained  in  AFI  10-2501,  Air  Force  Emergency Management  Program.  Specific details on the AFMS emergency management mission are provided  throughout  this  Instruction  and  in  AFI  10-2519,  Public  Health  Emergencies  and Incidents of Public Health Concern. 1.4.  Comprehensive Medical Readiness Program. 1.4.1.  Expeditionary  medics  must  be  “Readiness  Current”  to  provide  the  best  care  to  our patients.    The  “Readiness  Currency  Continuum”  is  built  on  three  interlinking  processes: Clinical  Currency  for  Readiness  (Category  I),  Readiness  Skills  Training  (Category  II),  and Unit Type Code (UTC) Readiness Training (Category III).  Each builds upon the other and assumes a capability of experience with which to proceed to the next level. 1.4.2.  Readiness currency starts with Clinical Currency, the ability of our medics to provide quality  healthcare  in  support  of  the  readiness  mission.    Medics  build  on  their  clinical currency by adding individual readiness skills that will enable them to perform the functions of their AFSC in a deployed setting.  Next is UTC readiness training, which enables medics to execute AFMS expeditionary missions. 1.5.  Manpower  and  Equipment  Force  Packaging  (MEFPAK)  Responsible  Agencies (MRA). 1.5.1.  To maintain the viability and effectiveness of its deployable medical capabilities, the AFMS  has  assigned  MEFPAK  responsibilities  to  specific  MAJCOM/SGs.    Air  Combat Command  is  the  MRA  for  medical  ground-based  unit  type  codes  (UTCs)  and  the  lead MAJCOM for the Medical Counter-CBRN program.  Air Mobility Command is the MRA for en-route  care,  the  Patient  Movement  Items  (PMI)  program,  and  En-route  Care  Safe-to-Fly program.  Air Force Special Operations Command is the MRA for special operations medical UTCs. 1.5.2.  Additional  MAJCOMs  with  mission  or  theater-unique  capabilities  or  requirements may  also  serve  as  a  MRA  with  AF/SG3/5X  approval.    Pilot  units  work  closely  with  the MRAs  to  construct  UTCs,  associated  mission  capability  statements  (MISCAPs),  and manpower details. AFI41-106  9 JUNE 2017 11 1.6.  Medical Readiness Resourcing. 1.6.1.  To maintain a robust medical readiness capability, the AFMS manages the funding for training, exercises, personnel and equipment through an internal planning, programming, and budgeting system. 1.6.1.1.  Readiness  Requirements  Planning  and  Resourcing  (RRPR).    The  goal  of  the RRPR  is  to  program  for  and  execute  Line  of  the  Air  Force  Working  Capital  Fund Medical  Dental  Division,  Line  of  the  Air  Force  O&M,  and  Defense  Health  Program (DHP) Medical Resources.  The primary objectives of the RRPR process is to:  (1) create a knowledgeable, cross-functional decision process that enables and tracks the execution of  AFMS  readiness  programs;  (2)  capture  the  AFMS  specific  capability  requirements needed by CCDRs to support joint war fighting medical support, (3) focus resource needs for  organize,  train  and  equip  functions;  (4)  provide  a  validation  mechanism  to  review requirements  and  apply  resources;  (5)  communicate  AF/SG  intent  regarding  application of  resources;  and  (6)  provide  best  possible  recommendations  to  the  AF/SG  regarding readiness programs. 1.6.1.1.1.  Medical  Readiness  Panel  (MRP).    The  MRP  is  the  AFMS  center  of expertise  for  all  readiness-specific  organize,  train,  equip  and  plan  functions  and serves as the first level of corporate review.  The panel is the initial point of entry for issues from PEMs and MRAs that require corporate review.  The panel reviews and develops  options  for  presentation  to  the  corporate  board.    Throughout  the  year,  the MRP focuses upon information collection and meets as required.  The MRP is chaired by AF/SG3/5X. 1.6.1.1.2.  The  MRP  ensures  resources  are  provided  across  the  AFMS  to  create  and maintain  global  response  initiatives.    Medical  readiness  resources  are  provided  by Defense Health Programs (DHP) funding for operations and maintenance (O&M) and PMI, and LAF funding for War Reserve Materiel (WRM) and HSMR assets. 1.6.1.2.  Business  Planning.    Medical  treatment  facility  commanders  execute  a  business plan that maximizes the use of assigned personnel and available resources.  This strategy allows a commander to plan and execute effective training at a predictable cost in terms of both resources and medical treatment facility production in three ways: readiness case analysis,  currency  case  analysis,  and  business  case  analysis.    Readiness  is  a  critical element  of  business  planning  and  should  include  training  requirements,  exercise opportunities, and deployment and contingency response obligations. 1.6.1.3.  MC-CBRN  Resources.    The  AFMS  plans  for  contingencies  that  exceed  the normal  operating  capacity  of  field  units.    The  AFMS  utilizes  LAF  MC-CBRN  funds  to provide additional materiel needed to execute the mission during these situations.  These HSMR  assets  are  presented  as  886  allowance  standards  (AS)  for  AC  and  reserve  units, and  976  AS  for  ANG  (Attachment  3)  to  enable  standardized  logistics  and  maintenance support.    This  materiel  will  continue  to  be  modernized  and  funded  within  the  DoD Chemical  Biological  Defense  Program  (CBDP)  and  AF  Operations  &  Maintenance (O&M)  program  element  (PE)  28036F  (Medical  Counter-CBRN)  (AC  and  non-collocated AFRC units) and ANG O&M PE 58036F (MC-CBRN), but will be fielded as all-hazards installation medical response resources in support of the Medical Contingency Response Plan (MCRP), Installation Emergency Management Plan (IEMP) 10-2 or sister 12 AFI41-106  9 JUNE 2017 service  emergency  management  (EM)  plans,  DSCA  or  local  support  agreements.    LAF funding may only be used to replenish items for shelf life  management and to replenish those  consumed  during  contingencies,  exercises,  and  training  involving  CBRN  hazards.  Replenishment  of  AS  materiel  consumed  during  contingencies,  exercises,  and  training not  involving  CBRN  hazards  will  be  replenished  using  appropriate  exercise  funding  or DHP  if  an  MTF  Health  Services  related  mission  requirement.    Note:    The  term  MC-CBRN  refers  to  the  funding  and  resourcing  associated  with  all-hazard  home  station medical response (HSMR) capabilities/functions. 1.6.1.3.1.  For full-time non-collocated AFRC bases, HSMR assets are maintained by the  Bioenvironmental  Engineering/Public  Health  Office.    For  ANG  Medical  Units, this  capability  will  be  assigned  under  the  976  MC-CBRN  program  to  the  full-time medical staff. 1.6.1.3.2.  MC-CBRN  resources  are  programmed  at  the  AF/SG  and  NGB/SG  levels by  consolidating  input  from  MAJCOMs  and  DRUs,  and  advocating  for  MC-CBRN requirements  through  the  AF  Installation  and  Mission  Support  Center  (AFIMSC) Agile Combat Support Panel and ANG Installation Support Panels. 1.6.2.  Unit  Medical  Operations  Resourcing.    The  unit  Medical  Readiness  Committee (MRC),  or  Executive  Management  Committee  (EMC)  for  ARC  units,  identifies  unit readiness training and resource requirements and provides a consolidated document to their respective  MAJCOM.    For  a  full  discussion  of  medical  resource  processes  and  procedures, see AFMAN 41-120, Medical Resource Management Operations 1.7.  Aeromedical Evacuation (AE). 1.7.1.  The  AFMS  partners  with  the  Operations  (A3)  community  to  provide  global  patient movement capability.  AMC/A3 provides comprehensive operational AE readiness guidance in AFI 10-2912, Aeromedical Evacuation Readiness Programs, while the SG is responsible for clinical  guidance for AE crews and medical/training guidance for SG managed en-route care  UTCs.    AMC/SG  manages  WRM  medical  equipment  allowance  standards  associated with en-route care. 1.7.2.  Training, plans, and reporting requirements listed in this instruction for medical units do not apply to AE units. 1.8.  Special Command Considerations. 1.8.1.  Policy guidance for commanders of Limited Readiness Capability (LRC) units differs from  other  MTFs  in  this  Instruction.    LRC  units  are  medical  functional  flights  and  small medical  squadrons  that  do  not  provide  the  full  scope  of  readiness  capabilities  or  resources found  in  a  typical  Medical  Group.    Major  Command  Surgeons  identify  and  designate appropriate  units  within  their  MAJCOM  as  LRC  units  in  Medical  Readiness  Decision Support System (MRDSS). 1.8.1.1.  LRC  units  are  often  assigned  to  non-medical  squadrons  or  to  groups  (e.g.  Air Base Squadrons, Mission Support Groups or Air Base Groups).  In some cases, the LRC units may report directly to the wing. AFI41-106  9 JUNE 2017 13 1.8.1.2.  Tenant units on bases where at least two Services share resources are considered LRC  units.    Joint  Base  MTFs,  in  which  AF  is  the  host  unit,  are  not  considered  LRC MTFs. 1.8.2.  ARC  medical  units  are  considered  LRC  units.    This  does  not  include  Aeromedical Evacuation (AE) units. 14 AFI41-106  9 JUNE 2017 Chapter 2 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.  Purpose. 2.1.1.

Special Planning Considerations. 4.3.1.  LRC and Deployed MTFs are not required to prepare an MCRP.  However, these units will  conduct  a  realistic  assessment  of  their  contingency  response  capabilities  (including HSMR) and incorporate them into the IEMP 10-2, or sister service equivalent.  (T-2)  Use the MCRP annex framework in  table 4.2 as a  guide in preparing the unit’s installation medical response input.  Clearly identify the unit’s capabilities, roles and responsibilities in support of a  collaborative  installation  response,  including  support  provided  via  MOU/MOA/MAA,  as appropriate.    Ensure  assigned  personnel  are  trained  and  record  this  training  in  MRDSS ULTRA  utilizing  existing  MCRP  team  names  as  applicable.    Local  MCRP  team  training requirements  may  be  added  to  allow  for  tracking  of  unit-unique  training.    Contact  the MRDSS Help Desk for assistance. 4.3.2.  ARC  and  Aeromedical  Evacuation  (AE)  units  collocated  with  an  AC  MTF  are considered available medical resources and may be, with prior coordination, included in the AC MTF’s MCRP as such. 4.3.3.  Depending  on  local  capabilities,  particularly  for  OCONUS  units,  support  may  be provided by another AF MTF. 4.3.4.  Units in multi-service or multi-unit areas, e.g. San Antonio or Colorado Springs, will develop an integrated MCRP, addressing a unified response to a citywide event or incident, as well as interaction between units and with local emergency management officials.  (T-2) 4.3.5.  FCCs will identify where the FCC PRA plan is maintained through an MCRP Annex labeled “FCC PRA Plan”. 4.4.  Medical Continuity of Operations (COOP). 4.4.1.  Medical  COOP  involves  the  evacuation  and  dispersal  of  patients  from  the  MTF  as rapidly  and  safely  as  possible,  staging  them  in  a  pre-designated  location  and  providing necessary medical care only until dispersal activities are complete.  Medical COOP does not involve  relocating  vast  amounts  of  supplies  and  personnel  to  an  alternate  location  for  the purpose  of  continuing  routine  patient  care,  although  units  that  have  the  capacity  or responsibility to continue to provide services to AD base populations may plan to do so. 4.4.2.  For Medical COOP, the core mission essential functions (MEF) to be addressed in the MCRP include: 1) medical command and control for the evacuation and dispersal; 2) patient support,  to  include  facility  evacuation,  dispersal,  transportation,  tracking,  and  pandemic response, at a minimum; 3) staff support, to include evacuation, dispersal, and accountability; 4) medical response activities, to include critical installation support; 5) Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Information (C4I), to include relocation and continuity of medical  command  and  control,  as  well  as  information  sharing  with  beneficiaries,  staff,  and higher  headquarters.    Units  may  add  additional  MEFs  based  on  their  unique  missions, capabilities, and beneficiary population needs.  List and prioritize all MEFs in the MCRP. 4.4.3.  See AFI 10-208, Air Force Continuity of Operations (COOP) Program, for additional non-medical specific guidance. 4.5.  MCRP Coordination. 4.5.1.  All  offices  and  agencies  tasked  to  provide  any  kind  of  support  in  the  MCRP  must coordinate on the plan, specifically approving their roles and responsibilities.  (T-2) 50 AFI41-106  9 JUNE 2017 4.5.2.  If unable to obtain coordination with an off-base agency, develop a memorandum for record  (MFR)  and  attach  all  correspondence  (e-mails,  memos,  phone  records,  etc.)  to document their attempts to gain formal coordination. 4.5.3.  Submit a copy of the draft MCRP to the parent MAJCOM/SGX for review after full coordination  with  applicable  agencies  and  MRC/EMC  approval,  but  prior  to  publication.  MAJCOM/SGXs will accomplish plan reviews within 60 days; concurrence is implied if no comments are received within that period. 4.6.  MCRP Review. 4.6.1.  Units  will  review  the  MCRP  and  supporting  checklists  annually  for  currency  and make  changes  as  necessary.    (T-3)    Coordinate  changes  with  all  affected  agencies  and distribute according to the original plan distribution. 4.6.2.  The MCRP will be rewritten when there is significant change in the wing's mission or unit  capabilities.    The  plan  must  be  reviewed  annually  by  Team  Chiefs  and  the  MRC  and documented in MRC minutes.  (T-2)  If changes are made, ensure they are coordinated with all impacted agencies.  Update the MCRP publication date in MRDSS ULTRA whenever the plan is re-published. 4.7.  MCRP Distribution. 4.7.1.  Distribute copies  of the MCRP and appropriate checklists to  each  office that plays  a role in its execution. 4.7.2.  The  MR  Office  will  maintain  additional  copies  for  transfer  to  the  shelter,  Medical Continuity  of  Operations  (COOP)  alternate  command  and  control  (C2)  location,  and  the installation EOC, as applicable.  (T-3) 4.8.  Memoranda  of  Understanding  (MOUs),  Memoranda  of  Agreement  (MOA),  and Mutual Aid Agreements (MAAs). 4.8.1.  Support  to  the  MTF  from  off-base  agencies  must  be  coordinated  in  writing,  in  the form  of  an  MOU,  MOA,  or  MAA,  in  accordance  with  AFI  25-201,  Support  Agreements Procedures.    (T-2)    Do  not  duplicate  existing  agreements  and  contracts,  such  as  the TRICARE contract. 4.8.2.  Approval  of  an  MOU/MOA/MAA  constitutes  agreement  with  the  MCRP  contents; therefore, an additional staff summary sheet is not required. AFI41-106  9 JUNE 2017 51 Chapter 5 MEDICAL READINESS TRAINING 5.1.  Training Philosophy. 5.1.1.  All medical personnel must be fully trained to meet the task requirements associated with  globally  integrated  operations  (GIO).    Leaders  at  all  levels  have  an  inherent responsibility  to  ensure  their  personnel  receive  the  full  spectrum  of  required  training,  from individual level through collective and unit level readiness training. 5.1.2.  The  Comprehensive  Medical  Readiness  Program  (CMRP)  divides  medical  readiness training  into  categories  to  support  targeted  application  of  requirements  for  specific specialties,  personnel,  and  missions  across  the  full  spectrum  of  AF  military  medical operations.    Category  I,  Clinical  Currency,  and  Category  II,  Readiness  Skills  Training,  are levied using CMRP checklists developed by specialty consultants, corps directors and CFMs.  Category III, UTC Training, is levied by the Category III Training Guide maintained on the AF  Medical  Readiness  SharePoint  Site.    Category  IV,  MCRP  Team  Training,  consists  of standardized  training  required  for  all  like  teams  across  the  AFMS  as  well  as  unit-specific training requirements. 5.1.3.  Recognizing all medical personnel must maintain a baseline training standard, medical personnel  assigned  to  non-medical  units  will  complete  the  Category  I  (if  applicable)  and  II training  requirements  in  this  chapter,  as  well  as  any  specialized  training  for  their  unique medical missions.  (T-1) 5.2.  Initial Medical Readiness Training. 5.2.1.  Airmen are trained to initial proficiency upon entry into the Air Force, or join the Air Force  with  verifiable  AFSC-specific  credentials.    Enlisted  personnel  receive  initial  medical readiness  training  through  Expeditionary  Medical  Readiness  Course  (EMRC)  or  Basic Expeditionary  Medical  Readiness  Training  (BEMRT)  in  conjunction  with  their  AFSC-awarding  courses.    Officers  receive  initial  medical  readiness  training  as  part  of  COT  or Reserve  Commissioned  Officer  Training  (RCOT)  courses,  or  through  a  commissioning program  such  as  a  service  academy,  Reserve  Officer  Training  Corps  (ROTC)  or  Officer Training School (OTS). 5.2.2.  Curricula  for  these  courses  provide  the  initial  medical  readiness  training  elements listed in Table 5.1., at a minimum. Table 5.1.  Initial Medical Readiness Training Topics.

Non-standard Training Situations. 5.3.1.  Training  While  Deployed.    Personnel  are  required  to  be  fully  trained  prior  to deployment.    Therefore,  deployed  units  are  not  expected  to  conduct  medical  readiness training.    However,  personnel  should  take  full  advantage  of  any  training  opportunities provided,  to  include  joint  training  with  coalition  partners,  sister  services,  and  host  nation medical  forces.    Upon  return  to  home  station,  members  may  request  credit  for  training accomplished  during  deployment,  with  appropriate  documentation,  in  accordance  with  this Instruction. 5.3.2.  Students.  Members in a formal training or student status are exempt from all medical readiness  training  requirements,  including  Comprehensive  Medical  Readiness  Program (CMRP) training.  Training or student status includes but is not limited to students, interns, residents, fellows, and those enrolled in Health Professions Scholarship Program (HPSP) or similar  programs.    Participation  in  local  readiness  training  venues  and  exercises  is  highly recommended whenever available. 5.3.3.  Medical Institutional Forces (IF).  Personnel assigned to higher headquarters, such as MAJCOMs,  certain  Field  Operating  Agencies  (FOA)  and  the  Air  Staff  will  complete  the CMRP requirements identified in this chapter when assigned to a standard deployable UTC or when tasked to deploy. 5.4.  Training Documentation  . 5.4.1.  All medical readiness training, including equivalency training credit (as applicable), is documented in MRDSS ULTRA for: (T-2) 5.4.1.1.  Assigned unit personnel. AFI41-106  9 JUNE 2017 53 5.4.1.2.  IMAs that are attached to the unit.  Assign IMAs to the FFAZZ Associate UTC in  MRDSS  ULTRA  for  tracking  purposes.    They  do  not  count  against  unit  training statistics. 5.4.1.3.  Other  medical  personnel  on  or  off  base  who  do  not  work  within  the  medical facility (e.g. Squadron Medical Element (SME) personnel).  These individuals are tracked by  associating  their  unit’s  Personnel  Accounting  System  Code  (PASCODE)  with  the MTF  within  MRDSS  ULTRA.    Doing  so  will  ensure  personnel  do  not  affect  MTF training  statistics.    For  remotely  located  medical  personnel  (e.g.  recruiters),  the  nearest MTF will assume responsibility for tracking their training.  (T-3)  Obtain the PASCODE for the unit to be associated and contact the MAJCOM/SGX MRDSS Administrator for assistance.  If coordination of training events or dates with these units is not successful, document  associated  communications  in  a  memorandum  for  record.    Exception:  AF Special  Operations  Command  (AFSOC)  Operational  Support  Medicine  (OSM)  flights and  AFSOC  medical  personnel  assigned to  Special  Tactics  Groups/Squadrons (STG/STS) track their own training in MRDSS ULTRA. 5.4.2.  Air Force Training Record (AFTR).  AFSC functional managers will review and print CMRP  checklists  and  AF  Forms  1098  from  MRDSS  ULTRA,  ensuring  all  training requirements  have  been  completed  and  properly  documented  prior  to  an  enlisted  member’s deployment.  (T-1)  Upload these documents into the member's AFTR following the review.  Upon  the  member's  return  to  home  station,  the  functional  manager  will  determine  if  any relevant training was accomplished during the deployment and, if so, document it in AFTR and upload any AF Forms 1098/AF Forms 623a provided.  (T-3) 5.5.  Training Equivalency. 5.5.1.  Formal Courses.  A list of training requirements that may be met through attendance of  formal  courses,  such  as  EMRC,  BEMRT  and  Commissioned  Officer  Training  (COT),  is provided  on  the  Medical  Readiness  Training  Equivalency  Matrix  on  the  AF  Medical Readiness SharePoint Site in the AFI 41-106 Toolbox. 5.5.2.  Exercises.  A list of exercises the MRAs have approved for sustainment training credit may  be  found  on  the  MRA’s  SharePoint  Site.    Sustainment  training  credit  may  also  be approved  by  the  appropriate  MRA  for  local  UTC  Mission  Essential  Task-driven  exercises validated  by  a  qualified  team  not  to  include  exercise  participants  (i.e.  WIT,  MR  office members,  other  medics  not  participating,  etc.).    Local  exercises  must  use  UTC  equipment packages  and  follow  the  checklists  and  timelines  found  on  the  MRA’s  SharePoint  site  to qualify  for sustainment  training credit.  Upon  completion of the exercise, an exercise AAR listing personnel and equipment UTCs utilized in the exercise and a list of participants must be  submitted  within  30  days  to  the  appropriate  MRA  for  sustainment  training  approval.  When approved, the MRA will update the sustainment training in MRDSS ULTRA using the exercise end date as the training completion date.   Members  may  request  UTC  sustainment 5.5.3.  Deployments. training  credit  for participation in real world operations and/or deployments.  Members who have deployed and performed  duties  consistent  with  their  assigned  UTC,  utilizing  the  UTC’s  assigned  war reserve  materiel  (WRM)  equipment  assemblages  in  an  expeditionary  (Bare  Base) environment  may  request  UTC  sustainment  training  credit.    Requests  will  be  forwarded through the parent MAJCOM/SGX to the appropriate MRA for approval. 54 AFI41-106  9 JUNE 2017 5.6.  CMRP Category I, Clinical Currency for Readiness. 5.6.1.  Clinical  Currency  for  Readiness  is  defined  as  the  fundamental  clinical  skills  of  an Airman,  usually  obtained  through  medical  education  and  in-garrison  care  that  form  a foundation  on  which  to  build  readiness  skills.    It  is  the  foundation  of  the  Comprehensive Medical  Readiness  Program  (CMRP)  and  applies  to  all  medical  personnel  with  clinical specialties  who  are  required  to  have  up-to-date  clinical  skills  in  a  practice  environment.  Clinical  currency  tasks  are  defined  by  specialty  consultants  and  CFMs  and  may  involve tracking the level of patients/procedures (volume, acuity, and diversity) to advance along the currency continuum.  There are multiple venues for maintaining clinical currency including, but not limited to, local TAAs, SMART, and C-STARS.  Unit Functional Training Managers will document Category I training using the CMRP checklist in MRDSS ULTRA and update the clinical currency verification date in accordance with consultant or CFM guidance. 5.6.2.  All  Category  I  training  will  be  current  prior  to  entering  a  deployment  vulnerability period  (DVP).    Any  clinical  currency  training  that  will  expire  during  the  DVP  must  be reaccomplished prior to entry into the DVP.  Personnel who are considered deployed in place and those who are required to maintain a high state of readiness (assigned an AEFI of YR) must be current on Category I training at all times.  (T-1) 5.6.3.  Privileged  providers  and  non-privileged  medical  professionals  will  also  follow  the policies  in  AFI  44-119,  Medical  Quality  Operations,  pertaining  to  licensure,  credentials, privileges,  and  certification  requirements.    In  addition,  personnel  holding  certain  clinical AFSCs  may  be  required  to  maintain  currency  in  Basic  Life  Support  (BLS),  Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS), Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS), National Registry of Emergency  Medical  Technicians  (NREMT),  Prehospital  Trauma  Life  Support  (PHTLS),  or other life support training, in accordance with AFI 44-102, Medical Care Management. 5.6.3.1.  Education  and  Training  (E&T)  office  personnel  will  validate  requirements  for each specialty  and track this training for military members, civilians, and contractors in MRDSS  ULTRA.    (T-1)    Representatives  from  the  E&T  office  will  be  given  MRDSS ULTRA  accounts  for  this  purpose.    Larger  facilities  may  designate  a  second  MRDSS ULTRA  Unit  System  Administrator  in  the  E&T  office  specifically  to  manage  E&T accounts. 5.6.3.2.  For  personnel  tasked  to  deploy,  licensure,  credentials  or  certifications  with expiration  dates  during  the  projected  deployment  vulnerability  period  must  be reaccomplished prior to departure.  Certifications expiring during unplanned deployment extensions may be waived until the individual returns to home station.  (T-1) 5.7.  CMRP Category II, Readiness Skills Training (RST). 5.7.1.  Readiness Skills Training is defined as the skills specific to an AFSC, which allow an Airman  to  perform  within  the  full  scope  of  their  AFSC  in  a  deployed  setting.    There  are multiple  venues  for  accomplishing  RST,  including  but  not  limited  to  local  training,  C-STARS,  and  the  Emergency  War  Surgery  Course.    Refer  to  the  CMRP  matrix  on  the  AF Medical  Readiness  SharePoint  Site  and  CMRP  checklists  for  additional  guidance.    Unit Functional Training Managers will document Category II training using the CMRP checklist MRDSS  ULTRA  and  update  the  clinical  currency  verification  date  in  accordance  with consultant or CFM guidance. AFI41-106  9 JUNE 2017 55 5.7.2.  Personnel  will  complete  Category  II  training  for  their  Control  AFSC  (CAFSC)  for enlisted  or  Duty  AFSC  (DAFSC)  for  officers.    (T-1)    Contact  the  appropriate  specialty consultant,  corps  director  or  CFM  to  determine  Category  II  training  requirements  for commanders on G series orders. 5.7.3.  Personnel who are utilized as authorized substitutes on a standard UTC must complete Category II training for the AFSC they are filling on the UTC, as well as their own AFSC.  (T-1)  Waivers or  exemptions  to  this policy must  be approved by the specialty  consultants, corps directors or CFMs for both  AFSCs.   Exception:  For UTCs that allow AFSC neutral substitutions  (e.g.  FFGLB  and  FFHSR),  authorized  substitutes  complete RST  for  their  own AFSC only. 5.7.4.  For  personnel  required  to  complete  Category  II,  training  will  begin  as  soon  as individuals  report  to  their  first  duty  station,  after  completing  technical  training  or professional education.  Category II training is required as follows: 5.7.4.1.  All  personnel  assigned  to  a  standard  deployable  UTC  will  be  current  on Category  II  training  prior  to  entering  their  deployment  vulnerability  period  (DVP)  and remain current for the duration of the DVP. 5.7.4.2.

Exercise Requirements. 6.1.1.  Non-medical  exercise  requirements  may  be  met  by  participating  in  wing/installation exercises.  If the wing/installation does not accomplish all exercises listed in AFI 90-201, the MTF/LRC  unit  is  not  expected  to  accomplish  them  independently.    However,  if  wing exercises  that  are  conducted  do  not  adequately  test  the  unit’s  capabilities  (for  example,  the exercise stops at the entrance to the medical facility), units will develop internal scenarios to supplement or extend the exercise. 6.1.2.  Units  should  make  every  effort  to  maximize  participation  in  exercises  while minimizing disruptions to patient care. 6.1.3.  The following are medical-specific exercise requirements: 6.1.4.  Recalls.  Recall exercises demonstrate the unit’s ability to return to duty in response to a  contingency  situation.    Acceptable  response  standards  are  generally  established  by  the wing.  If no wing standard exists, the MRC must establish the standard and include it in the Basic Plan of the MCRP.  Conduct each of the following recall types at least once annually: MCRP  Teams,  UTCs,  deployment  support  teams,  and  one  unit-wide  recall.    The  unit-wide recall may alternate between telephonic voice or text only and report-to-duty each  year and may be combined with other exercises, as appropriate.  (T-2) 6.1.5.  Installation  Medical  Response.    Units  that  publish  MCRPs  are  required  to  conduct installation  medical  response  exercises.    (T-0:  The  Joint  Commission  (TJC)  Emergency Management Standards)  At the commander’s discretion, annexes may be exercised together, as part of a comprehensive exercise, as functionally appropriate to support realistic scenarios and response, while minimizing impact to wing operations and patient care.  Units that do not publish MCRPs, but provide input to the IEMP 10-2 or sister service equivalent IEM plans, must  also  exercise  this  capability  annually.    (T-0:  TJC  Emergency  Management  Standards)  Emergency  response  exercises  will  include  an  influx  from  outside  the  organization  of volunteer  or  simulated  casualties.    Enough  casualties  should  be  used  to  adequately  test  the organization's resources and reactions under stress. 6.1.6.  Comply  with  reporting  and  documentation  requirements  in  this  Instruction  for  all exercises. (T-1) 6.1.7.  Additional information is provided in the AF Medical Readiness Guide. 6.2.  Exercise Credit. 6.2.1.  Medical units may take exercise credit for a real world response of similar scope and magnitude  to  the  exercise  requirements.    For  example,  a  response  to  a  bus  accident  with multiple  casualties  utilizing  numerous  MCRP  teams  may  satisfy  a  major  accident  exercise requirement. 6.2.2.  Credit  may  be  taken  only  when  objectives  are  met  for  the  specific  exercise  type  or subsequent corrective action is successful. AFI41-106  9 JUNE 2017 61 6.3.  Special Exercise Considerations. 6.3.1.  LRC units will work with their wing/base/installation IG (or equivalent) to determine the best way to conduct required exercises.  Exercises should be combined with sister service or wing/base/installation exercises to the greatest extent possible.  Exercise scenarios must be developed collaboratively to test medical response capabilities as they would realistically be employed.  In addition, LRC units will conduct each of the following recall types annually: installation  medical  response  teams,  UTCs,  deployment  support  team(s),  and  one  unit-wide recall.  The unit-wide  recall may alternate between telephonic only  and report-to-duty each year and may be combined with other exercises, as appropriate.  (T-2)  LRC units may also be required to participate in host unit/service exercises. 6.3.2.  Deployed  MTFs  should  participate  in  the  host  wing/base/installation’s  exercise program,  as  mission  requirements  permit,  especially  major  accident  response.    Deployed MTFs  are  not  expected  to  plan  or  conduct  large-scale  exercises  on  their  own;  however, deployed MTFs will conduct  a unit-wide  recall,  or personnel  accountability exercise, every three months.  (T-2) 62 AFI41-106  9 JUNE 2017 Chapter 7 MEDICAL READINESS REPORTING 7.1.  Readiness Reports. 7.1.1.  Resource  and  capability  readiness  reports  provide  higher  headquarters  and  other interested  organizations,  up  to  and  including  the  Office  of  the  Secretary  of  Defense  and National  Command Authority, necessary information to  make critical  decisions with  regard to deployments and resource requirements. 7.1.2.  The first two reports described below are updated at the unit level each month, giving commanders the opportunity to  assess  and report their unit  resources  and capabilities.  The remaining  reporting  processes  are  accomplished  as  needed  to  relay  vital  information  to higher headquarters before, during, or after a deployment or major event, as directed in this Instruction and referenced governing directives. 7.2.  Resource Readiness Reporting. 7.2.1.  Resource  readiness  reporting  is  accomplished  using  the  AF  Input  Tool  (AF-IT)  in Defense  Readiness  Reporting  System  (DRRS).    Personnel  (total  and  critical),  training, equipment  and  supplies  on-hand  are  reported  in  accordance  with  the  AF  Tables  in  DRRS.  (T-0: DoDI 7730.66, CJCSI 3401.02B, AFPD 10-2, CJCSM 3150.01, CJCSI 3401.02) 7.2.1.1.  Reference AFI 10-201, Force Readiness Reporting, for reporting guidance. 7.3.  Capability Readiness Assessments. 7.3.1.  Capability  readiness  assessments  are  accomplished  in  DRRS  and  focus  on  the  full scope of the unit’s core mission capabilities assessed against mission essential tasks (METs), which are informed by the resource readiness report and UTC readiness assessments (ART).  Medical  unit  commanders  will  assess  unit  mission  capabilities  in  accordance  with  AFI  10-201, and the following: (T-0: DoDI 6055.17, DoDI 7730.66, CJCSI 3401.02B, AFPD 10-2, CJCSM 3150.01, CJCSI 3401.02) 7.3.1.1.  For deployment missions, consider the deployability, availability, and training of personnel assigned to applicable UTCs, and critical percentages for assigned contingency materiel.    Contingency  materiel  maintained  for  other  units  will  be  assessed  by  the “owning/using” units. 7.3.1.2.  For  in-place/generation/homeland  response  missions,  consider  all  assigned  unit personnel,  to  include  military  members,  civilians,  and  contractors,  and  their  required training (e.g. UTC and MCRP team training), when assessing mission capability. 7.3.1.3.  Consider  mission  manning,  training,  resources,  as  well  as  results  of  exercises and inspections when assessing the unit’s mission capabilities. 7.3.1.4.  Units with more than one “copy” of a UTC will assess the mission as a whole. (T-2) 7.3.1.5.  For units with fragmented (shared/split) UTCs, the parent/supported unit, as the “owner”  of  that  mission,  assesses  the  fragmented  mission  capability  as  a  whole.  Supporting units (those providing manpower to another unit’s UTCs) will not assess their AFI41-106  9 JUNE 2017 63 portion(s)  of  that  mission  in  their  capability  assessment.  (T-2)    Note:    This  is  different from resource readiness reporting, in which a unit is reporting the readiness of assigned resources, rather than assigned missions. 7.3.1.6.  Assessment  of  the  All-hazard  Installation  Medical  Response  MET  should  be informed by RTAP TDs, wing/medical response plans, exercise AARs, team status, and equipment  availability  to  assess  the  unit’s  overall  unit  installation  medical  response capability against likely hazards and threats. 7.3.1.6.1.  Annually,  brief  capability  assessment  to  the  MRC  (or  EMC)  and  to  the installation’s  Emergency  Management  Working  Group  (EMWG).    (T-0:  DoDI 6055.17)  Note:  This briefing will be classified SECRET. 7.3.1.6.2.  Reference  the  Medical  Readiness  Guide  for  additional  information  on Capability Assessment Factors. 7.3.2.  All  reporting  medical  units  will  include  a  monthly  overall  Unit  Mission  Assessment Comment in the capability assessment, comparing the unit’s resource readiness C-level to the capability readiness assessment.  If the resource readiness C-level aligns with the capability readiness  assessment  level  (e.g.,  resource  readiness  is  C-1  and  capability  readiness  is  Y-Green) state so in the comment.  If resource readiness C-level does not align with capability readiness  assessment  (e.g.  resource  readiness  is  C-3  and  capability  readiness  is  Y-Green) provide rationale for the difference in ratings in layman’s terms. 7.3.3.  Once the AFMS Core METL template has been copied to the unit’s core METL, non-applicable METs and performance measures may be deleted only after obtaining MAJCOM FAM approval.  Update the unit’s core METL anytime the unit’s MRL or mission changes.  (T-0: DoDI 7730.66, CJCSI 3401.02B, AFPD 10-2, CJCSM 3150.01, CJCSI 3401.02)  Units will  make  no  other  alterations  or  modifications  to  the  unit’s  core  METL,  but  may  submit recommendations for updates or changes to the parent MAJCOM FAM. (T-2) 7.4.  Medical Report for Disasters, Emergencies and Contingencies (MEDRED-C). 7.4.1.  The  MEDRED-C  provides  information  on  USAF  Medical  Service  unit  operational readiness  status,  availability,  and  patient  care  activities  during  in-garrison  and  deployed contingency  operations.    MEDRED-Cs  also  apply  to  medical  units  influenced  by  unusual occurrences (e.g., natural disasters or other emergencies).  MEDRED-Cs are completed using the input tool provided on the AFMS DRRS Dashboard (T-1). 7.4.1.1.  Part A – Deployed Units.  Deployed units will complete a MEDRED-C Part A within  24  hours  of  establishing  initial  operations  and  provide  updates  on  a  daily  basis thereafter.    MEDRED-C  updates  will  cover  the  PREVIOUS  24-hour  period  (0001-2359Z). 7.4.1.2.  Part B – In-Garrison Units.  In-garrison AF medical units complete a MEDRED-C  Part  B  during  all  exercises  and  real-world  events  that  adversely  impact  the  unit’s normal  operations,  capabilities,  or  otherwise  impairs  the  unit’s  ability  to  carry  out  its mission.    Submissions  are  required  within  two  hours  of  initial  impact  from  the  event.  Significant  MTF  events  include,  but  not  limited  to,  natural  disasters,  prolonged  power outages, technological disasters, covert attack, active shooter, and/or a CBRN event that affects the unit.  Follow-on MEDRED-Cs providing status updates will be accomplished 64 AFI41-106  9 JUNE 2017 every  24  hours  for  as  long  as  the  event  persists,  and  a  final  submission  will  be accomplished  upon  resuming  normal  operations.    Notify  the  parent  MAJCOM  upon submission of a Part B MEDRED-C. 7.4.2.  Additional  guidance for completing the MEDRED-C is  provided on the AF Medical Readiness SharePoint Site. 7.5.  After Action Report (AAR). 7.5.1.  Accomplish  AARs  after  deployments,  contingencies,  and  exercises,  in  accordance with  AFI  90-1601,  Air  Force  Lessons  Learned  Program.    (T-3)    After  action  reports  will document  observations,  which  have  or  can  result  in  improvements to  military  operations  at the strategic, operational, or tactical level.  AARs are intended to be more than a summary or rollup  of  unit/tactical  actions.    AAR  observations  should  describe  how  the  mission  could be/was  improved,  potential  risks  to  mission  degradation/how  to  mitigate  those  risks,  and include  recommended  Doctrine,  Organization,  Training,  Materiel,  Leadership,  Personnel, Facilities  and  Policy  (DOTmMLPF-P)  changes  and  corrective  actions,  as  appropriate.  Examples  may  be  found  on  the  AF  Medical  Readiness  SharePoint  Site.    Additional information, including submission guidance is provided in the AF Medical Readiness Guide. 7.5.1.1.  Deployment After Action Reporting. 7.5.1.1.1.  All  deploying  AFMS  personnel  will  complete  a  post-deployment questionnaire  concerning  deployment  preparation  and  training.    Instructions  for completing the questionnaire can be found in the Medical Readiness Guide. 7.5.1.1.2.  Deployed  medical  unit  commanders  will  collect  input  from  their  unit personnel  and  compile  a  consolidated  AAR  covering  the  time  period  of  their command  prior  to  return  to  home  station.    After  action  reports  will  be  submitted  in AF-Joint  Lessons  Learned  Information  System  (JLLIS)  at the  appropriate classification  level  (NIPRNET  or  SIPRNET);  AFMSA/SG3X;  and  the  organization sponsoring the deployment. (T-2)  Instructions for using AF-JLLIS and sample after action reports can be found on the AFMS Kx lessons learned page. 7.5.1.2.  In-Garrison  After  Action  Reporting.    Medical  units  will  compile  after  action reports  after  each  exercise  or  real  world  incident.    AARs  will  be  compiled  by  the  MR office within 30 days of the event if medical inputs are not fully incorporated into a Wing AAR.  AARs  for real  world incidents  will be submitted in  AF-JLLIS.  Examples of in-garrison after action reports can be found on the AFMS Kx lessons learned page. 7.5.2.  The MRC will review AARs, identify best practices, lessons observed, and corrective actions  from  AARs.    Unit  commanders  will  elevate  issues  that  cannot  be  resolved  at  the installation level to the parent MAJCOM/SGX.  MARK A.

using  organic  and/or  contracted  aircraft with medical aircrew trained explicitly for that mission.  AE forces can operate as far forward as aircraft  are  able  to  conduct  air  operations,  across  the  full  spectrum  of  globally  integrated operations (GIO), and in all operating environments.  Specialty medical teams may be assigned to work with the AE aircrew to support patients requiring more intensive en-route care. Community  Recovery—The  process  of  assessing  the  effects  of  an  Incident  of  National Significance, defining resources, and developing and implementing a course of action to restore and revitalize the socioeconomic and physical structure of a community. Core requirements—Those essential individual training requirements needed to accomplish the AFMS mission. Critical Infrastructure—Systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the US that the  incapacity  or  destruction  of  such  systems  and  assets  would  have  a  debilitating  impact  on security,  national  economic  security,  national  public  health  or  safety,  or  any  combination  of those matters. Defense  Support  of  Civil  Authorities  (DSCA)—Refers  to  DoD  support,  including  Federal military  forces,  DoD  civilians  and  DoD  contractor  personnel,  and  DoD  agencies  and components, for domestic emergencies, and for designated law enforcement and other activities. Disease  Prevention—Encompasses  the  anticipation,  prediction,  identification,  prevention,  and control  of  preventable  diseases,  illnesses,  and  injuries  caused  by  exposure  to  biological, AFI41-106  9 JUNE 2017 73 chemical,  physical  or  psychological  threats  or  stressors  found  at  home  station  and  during deployments. Emergency  Operations  Center  (EOC)—The  physical  location  at  which  the  coordination  of information  and  resources  to  support  domestic  incident  management  activities  normally  takes place.  An EOC may be located in a permanent or temporary location.  EOCs may be organized by  major  functional  disciplines  (fire,  law  enforcement,  medical  services,  etc.),  by  jurisdiction (Federal, State, regional, county, city, tribal), or by some combination. Emergency  Responders  (medical)—Disaster  Response  Force  members  who  deploy  after  first responders and provide additional support.  They include follow- on medical personnel including additional ambulances, physicians, nurses, technicians, and other specialized teams.  Teams such as radiology, laboratory, pharmacy, surgery, and nutritional medicine would not ordinarily leave the facility and are therefore not considered emergency responders.  Examples of MCRP teams in  the  emergency  responder  category  would  be  the  Field  Response  Team,  Triage  Team,  the Public Health Team, and the Nursing Services Team. Emergency  Support  Function—A  grouping  of  government  and  certain  private  sector capabilities  into  an  organizational  structure  to  provide  the  support,  resources,  program implementation, and services to help communities recover following domestic incidents. Federal  Coordinating  Center  (FCC)—A facility located in  a metropolitan area of the United States,  and  Puerto  Rico,  responsible  for  day-to-day  coordination  of  planning  and  operations  in one  or  more  assigned  geographic  NDMS  Patient  Reception  Areas  (PRA).    Note:  The  main difference  between  the  FCC  and  the  Primary  Receiving  Center  (PRC)  mission  is  FCCs coordinate  planning,  training,  exercising,  and  operations  of  one  or  more  NDMS  PRAs.    PRCs receive; triage, stage, transport, and track patients affected by a disaster to participating NDMS inpatient hospitals capable of providing the required definitive care. Homeland  Security  Exercise  and  Evaluation Program  (HSEEP)—Provides a set of guiding principles  for  exercise  programs,  as  well  as  a  common  approach  to  exercise  program management, design and development, conduct, evaluation, and improvement planning.  HSEEP principles  are  applicable  for  exercises  across  all  mission  areas—prevention,  protection, mitigation,  response,  and  recovery.    HSEEP  principles  should  be  utilized  in  the  development, assessment, and review of all exercises. Installation  Medical  Response—Term  that  encompasses  the  full  spectrum  of  installation medical  response  activities,  including  medical  contingency  response,  defense  support  of  civil authorities, civil support, and disaster response. The  Joint  Commission—Previously  called  the  Joint  Commission  on  Accreditation  of Healthcare Organizations.  The name change reflects the Joint Commission’s continuing efforts to improve the value of accreditation and its utility as a mechanism for improving the quality and safety of patient care in all organizations. Patient  Reception  Area  (PRA)—A  geographic  locale  containing  one  or  more  airfields,  bus stations,  or  airfields;  adequate  patient  staging  facilities;  and  adequate  local  patient  transport assets to support patient reception and transport to pre-identified, non-Federal, acute care NDMS hospitals capable of providing definitive care for victims of a domestic disaster, emergency, or military contingency.  Generally, these hospitals are within a 50-mile radius. 74 AFI41-106  9 JUNE 2017 Primary  Receiving  Center  (PRC)—A  Military  Treatment  Facility  (MTF)  or  Veterans Administration  (VA)  Medical  Center  (VAMC)  designated  for  coordinating  and/or  providing treatment  to  sick  and  wounded  military  personnel  returning  from  armed  conflict  or  national emergency.    The  main  difference  between  the  FCC  and  the  PRC  mission  is  FCC’s  coordinate planning,  training,  exercising  and  operations  of  one  or  more  NDMS  Patient  Reception  Areas.  FCCs  receive;  triage,  stage,  transport  and  track  already-inpatients  affected  by  a  disaster  to participating  NDMS  inpatient  hospitals  capable  of  providing  the  required  definitive  care.    The patients may not be eligible for care in a Federal treatment facility.  The mission of a PRC is to receive and treat sick and wounded military personnel returning from armed conflict or national emergency. Secondary Support Center (SSC)—Military Treatment Facility (MTF) or VA Medical Center (VAMC)  designated  to  accept  transfers  from,  or  sharing  resources  with,  a  Primary  Receiving Center (DoD or VA Only) to maximize health care services support to the DoD. Wound  and  Casualty  Management—Wound  management  refers  to  those  medical  skills  that are  needed  to  care  for  trauma  and  disease  non-  battle  injury  patient  conditions.    Casualty management refers to those skills that are needed to triage and regulate casualties, to include land and air medical evacuation, and staging. AFI41-106  9 JUNE 2017 75 Attachment 2 APPLICATION OF THE LAW OF ARMED CONFLICT A2.1.  General. A2.1.1.  As  a  matter  of  Air  Force  policy,  medical  personnel  may  deploy  as  either noncombatants or combatants.  The protections afforded under the Geneva Conventions are different  for  each  category,  and  therefore,  medical  personnel  should  verify  their  status  and the consequences of that status prior to deployment. A2.2.  Noncombatants. A2.2.1.  Medical personnel are considered noncombatants if they are exclusively engaged in performing  medical  duties.    This  includes  supporting  duties  such  as  medical  records, administration,  disease  prevention,  and the  variety  of  missions  performed  by Bioenvironmental  Engineering  personnel  for  the  purposes  of  prevention  of  disease/sickness through  health  risk  assessment  and  control.    Noncombatants  may  carry  weapons  for  self-defense,  defense  of  patients,  or  defense  of  other  noncombatants  such  as  their  co-workers.  However,  medical  personnel  may  not  engage  in  actions  that  are  harmful  to  lawful  enemy combatants,  such  as  offensive  military  operations,  convoy  operations,  or  laying  minefields, without losing their noncombatant status for the duration of their deployment and subjecting themselves to being targeted by the enemy.  If captured, true non-combatants are considered retained personnel and not prisoners of war. A2.3.  Combatants. A2.3.1.  Medical  personnel  may  deploy  as  combatants  and  as  such  are  prohibited  from appearing as noncombatants while deployed in a combatant capacity.  This means that while serving in a combatant role: A2.3.2.  Medical personnel will not wear the large Red Cross armband. A2.3.3.  Medical  personnel  will  not  carry  a  common  access  card  (CAC)  displaying  a  red cross. A2.3.4.  Medical  personnel  are not  entitled to  special protection against enemy  attacks.  (In this scenario, medical personnel are lawful targets.) A2.3.5.  Upon capture, medical personnel in combatant roles are considered prisoners of war rather than retained personnel.  However, the capturing force may elect to use the captured medical  personnel  in  their  medical  capacity  instead.    In  that  event,  the  medical  personnel would be entitled to the same treatment as retained personnel. A2.4.  Disclaimer. A2.4.1.  This section is not intended to answer all of the possible scenarios for medical-legal issues  relating  to  combatants  and  noncombatants.    The  Air  Force  Judge  Advocate  General should be consulted for answers to specific questions.  Also, AF/JAO has published specific legal  reviews for medical  personnel  and those documents should be reviewed (see  AF/JAO Memorandums dated 08 Sep 08 at on the AF Medical Readiness SharePoint Site assessable through the AF Portal.
