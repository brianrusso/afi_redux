OVERVIEW. 1.1.  Purpose. 1.1.1.  This  Air  Force  Instruction  (AFI)  implements  the  hazards  of  electromagnetic radiation to ordnance (HERO) certification and management requirements of the Weapon System Safety and Explosives Safety Programs. AFI91-208  1 FEBRUARY 2017 3 1.1.2.  With  the  exception  of  the  Eastern  and  Western  Space  Test  Ranges,  the  HERO program encompasses the establishment and implementation of explosives reliability and safety standards, criteria, instructions, regulations, and electromagnetic emission control procedures  of  electromagnetic  radiation  (EMR)  emitters  throughout  the  Air  Force  in accordance  with  (IAW)  the  organization  and  general  responsibilities  assigned  by  this instruction. (MIL-STD)-464,  Electromagnetic  Environmental  Effects 1.1.3.  Military-Standard Requirements for Systems, latest revision, general requirements indicate that each system, i.e.,  aircraft,  ground  vehicles,  ordnance  containing  electrically  initiated  devices  (EIDs), etc., will be electromagnetically compatible among all subsystems and equipment within the system and with environments generated by EMR emitters and other electromagnetic sources  external  to  the  system  to  ensure  safe  and  proper  operation  and  performance.  Design  techniques  used  to  protect  ordnance  against  EMR  effects  must  be  verifiable, maintainable, and effective over the rated lifecycle of the system.  Verification addresses all lifecycle aspects of the system, including (as applicable) normal in-service operations, checkout, maintenance, storage, transportation, handling, packaging, loading, unloading, launch, and normal operating procedures associated with each aspect. requirement  of intra-system  electromagnetic  compatibility 1.1.4.  MIL-STD-464 indicates the system will be electromagnetically  compatible with  itself such that  system operational performance requirements are met.  Verify compliance by system-level test, analysis,  or  combination  thereof  IAW  guidance  provided  by  Military-Handbook  (MIL-HDBK)-240,  Hazards  of  Electromagnetic  Radiation  to  Ordnance  Test  Guide,  latest revision.  Integration of individual components shown to be HERO SAFE does not imply the resulting system is a HERO SAFE system. 1.1.5.  MIL-HDBK-240  defines  HERO  as  the  situation  in  which  exposure  to  external electromagnetic environments (EMEs) results in specified safety or reliability margins of EIDs  or  electrically  powered  ordnance  firing  circuits  to  be  exceeded,  or  EIDs  to  be inadvertently  actuated.    External  EMEs  may  originate  from  intentional  transmitting sources  (e.g.,  radios,  radars,  electronic  countermeasures  equipment)  or  unintentional sources  (e.g.,  arcing,  high  current  switching  transients).    Consequences  include  both safety functional characteristics) effects. (EID  dudding  or  altered (premature firing)  and reliability 1.1.6.  MIL-STD-464 and  MIL-HDBK-240 SUSCEPTIBLE, and HERO UNSAFE as follows: define  HERO SAFE,  HERO 1.1.6.1.  HERO SAFE.  Any ordnance item that is sufficiently shielded or otherwise so protected that all EIDs contained by the item are immune to adverse effects (safety and reliability) when the item  is  employed in  the radio  frequency (RF) environment delineated in MIL-STD-464.  The general HERO requirements defined in the hazards from EMR manuals must still be observed. 1.1.6.2.  HERO SUSCEPTIBLE.  Any ordnance item containing EIDs proven by test or  analysis  to  be  adversely  affected  by  EMR  to  the  point  that  the  safety  and/or reliability  of  the  system  is  in  jeopardy  when  the  system  is  employed  in  the  EME delineated in MIL-STD-464. 4 AFI91-208  1 FEBRUARY 2017 1.1.6.3.  HERO  UNSAFE.    Any  ordnance  item  containing  EIDs  not  certified  as HERO  SAFE  or  HERO  SUSCEPTIBLE  as  a  result  of  a  HERO  analysis  or  test.  Additionally, any ordnance item containing EIDs (including those previously certified as  HERO  SAFE  or  HERO  SUSCEPTIBLE)  that  has  its  internal  wiring  exposed; when  tests  are  being  conducted  on  that  item  resulting  in  additional  electrical connections  to  the  item;  when  EIDs  having  exposed  wire  leads  are  present  and handled or loaded in any but the tested condition; when the item is being assembled or  disassembled;  or  when  such  ordnance  items  are  damaged  causing  exposure  of internal wiring or components or destroying engineered HERO protective devices. 1.1.7.  Percussion-initiated ordnance have no HERO requirements and shall be notated as no HERO requirement (NHR). 1.2.  Requirement. 1.2.1.  To address  HERO as stated in  Department  of Defense  (DoD)  Instruction (DoDI) 3222.03,  DoD  Electromagnetic  Environmental  Effects  (E3)  Program,  latest  revision, DoD Directive (DoDD) 6055.09E, Explosives Safety Management (ESM), latest revision, and  DoD  Manual  6055.09-M,  Volume  2,  DoD  Ammunition  and  Explosives  Safety Standards:    Explosives  Safety  Construction  Criteria,  latest  revision.    Air  Force  shall ensure  all  programs  conform  to  MIL-STD-464.    Exceptions  to  such  certification  are commercial space launched type EID applications. 1.2.2.  Per DoDI 3222.03, the Air Force shall ensure all E3 issues, which include HERO, shall  be  identified  and  assessed  prior  to  entering  the  Systems  Demonstration  and Production and Deployment phases and are addressed during critical design reviews.  The Air  Force  shall  ensure  ordnance  is  not  deployed  or  released  for  Service  use  until  it  is HERO certified (HERO SAFE, HERO SUSCEPTIBLE, or HERO UNSAFE). 1.3.  Scope. 1.3.1.  The HERO program includes, but is not limited to, vulnerable assets and sources.  Vulnerable  assets  include  nuclear  weapons  and  conventional  ordnance  such  as  gun systems and their munitions, missiles, bombs, flares, aerial target drones, depth charges, mines,  torpedoes,  and  other  materials  embodying  EIDs  (e.g.,  cable  cutters,  chaff  and munitions  dispensers,  self-destruct  devices,  aircraft  engine  fire  extinguishing  systems, aircraft  ejection  seats,  etc.).    Sources  include  aircraft  and  store  EMR  emitters,  radars, antennas,  RF  identification  (RFID)  systems,  wireless  laptops,  handheld  communication devices, etc. 1.3.2.  Ordnance applicable to this instructions consists of all equipment, subsystems, and materials  containing  EIDs,  which  affects  safety  and/or  mission  reliability.    Safety  or mission  critical  EIDs  are  typically  used  to  initiate  explosives,  chemicals,  pyrotechnics, and similar stores carried on airborne, sea, space, or ground systems. 1.3.3.  An  EID  is  a  single  unit,  device,  or  subassembly  that  uses  electrical  energy  to produce  an  explosive,  pyrotechnic,  thermal,  or  mechanical  output.    Examples  include electro-explosive  devices  such  as  hot  bridgewire,  exploding  bridgewire,  semiconductor bridge, carbon bridge, and conductive composition, as well as, laser initiators, burn wires, fusible  links,  and  exploding  foil  initiators  (EFIs),  such  as  slapper  detonators  and  low energy EFIs. AFI91-208  1 FEBRUARY 2017 5 1.3.4.  Ordnance  test  variants  that  contain  EIDs  and  include  temporary  instrumentation, such  as  measurement  hardware,  telemetry,  flight  safety  systems/flight  termination systems, etc., are subject to this instruction and require a HERO assessment. 1.3.5.  This  instruction  applies  to  research,  development,  testing,  operations,  and equipment utilized during all six phases of the stockpile-to-safe separation sequence (S4) as  defined  in  MIL-HDBK-240;  transportation/storage,  assembly/disassembly,  staged, handling/loading,  platform-loaded,  and  immediate  post-launch.    Furthermore,  the program applies during the disposal of ordnance. 1.4.  Applicability. 1.4.1.  All ordnance, except for percussion or non-electrically initiated ordnance, used in or  on  Air  Force  installations,  ground  vehicles,  aircraft,  etc.,  including  Foreign  Military Sales (FMS) items only if they are also fielded for Air Force use. 1.4.2.  Responsible  ordnance  Program  Managers  (PMs)  will  ensure  certification  of complete  rounds  (CRs)  and  any  systems  containing  EIDs  at  the  appropriate  assembly level.  Ordnance components do not require HERO certification and shall be considered HERO  UNSAFE.    PMs  may  request  HERO  certification  of  components  to  alleviate assembly/  disassembly  operations  in  the  field.    A  CR  is  any  combination  of  DoD Identification Codes (DODICs) to form a higher assembly.  Identify CRs by using the CR Code (CRC) in the CR Dictionary maintained by the Global Ammunition Control Point at Hill Air Force Base. 1.4.3.  Ordnance  EIDs  and  EMR  emitters  used  by  the  Eastern  (45th  Space  Wing)  and Western (30th Space Wing) Ranges are addressed by Air Force Space Command Manual (AFSPCMAN)  91-710,  Range  Safety  User  Requirements  Manual,  latest  revision,  local Space  Wing  instructions,  and  Air  Force  Manual  (AFMAN)  91-201,  Explosives  Safety Standards,  latest  revision.    PMs  will  ensure  deviations  that  affect  Launch  Safety Requirements Relief Requests are IAW AFSPCMAN 91-710 requirements. 1.4.4.  Foreign  ordnance  to  be  fielded  by  the  Air  Force  requires  HERO  certification.  Foreign ordnance used by the Air Force as part of a joint development effort and/or usage requires a HERO assessment. 1.4.5.  PMs  employing or transporting ordnance on their platforms and/or transportation vehicles, e.g., aircraft, ground vehicles, drones, etc., are subject to this instruction. 1.5.  Implementation. 1.5.1.  The  primary  objective  of  the  HERO  program  is  to  have  all  Air  Force  ordnance certified  as  HERO  SAFE.    Until  ordnance  systems  are  HERO  certified,  guidance  in Attachment 10 shall apply to all HERO uncertified ordnance.  Ordnance PMs have until May  2018  to  achieve  certification.    If  funding  is  not  received  until  May  2018,  the responsible  ordnance  PM  has  until  May  2020  to  have  the  ordnance  certified appropriately.    Uncertified  ordnance  shall  be  considered  HERO  UNSAFE  and  listed  on the HERO website, https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/afsec/HERO/default.aspx. 1.5.2.  Ordnance PMs must ensure all existing ordnance, including nuclear weapons, are certified IAW this instruction.  For ordnance having HERO test data and/or analysis, the responsible ordnance PM shall submit a certification request to Air Force Safety Center, 6 AFI91-208  1 FEBRUARY 2017 Weapons  Safety  Division,  (AFSEC/SEW)  (Attachment  6).    For  ordnance  not  having HERO test data, analysis, or a combination thereof, the responsible ordnance PMs shall have the ordnance HERO tested, analyzed, or a combination thereof IAW this instruction. 1.5.2.1.  If HERO test data, analysis, or a combination thereof, for existing ordnance indicates  a  certification  of  HERO  SUSCEPTIBLE  or  HERO  UNSAFE,  the responsible ordnance PM shall attempt to resolve the issue and achieve HERO SAFE certification.    If  unable  to  achieve  HERO  SAFE  certification,  the  responsible  PM submits  a  certification  request  IAW  this  instruction  and  the  ordnance  is  certified  as either  HERO  SUSCEPTIBLE  or  HERO  UNSAFE,  depending  on  the  information provided. 1.5.2.2.  To  HERO  certify  legacy  ordnance,  an  assessment  of  the  existing  data, supporting analysis, or a combination thereof, will be required to show the ordnance satisfies  the  HERO  requirements  per  MIL-STD-464  and  the  host  platform  EME.  Existing  data  needs  to  address  the  ordnance  item  in  all  configurations  (i.e.,  storage, transportation, loading/installation, and operation) including the appropriate margins.  Operational  history  alone  does  not  provide  justification  for  HERO  certification  no matter how much time has passed without incident. 1.5.2.3.  For ordnance certified as either HERO SUSCEPTIBLE or HERO UNSAFE, Major Commands (MAJCOMs) will ensure separation distances from EMR emitters are greater than the determined safe separation distance (SSD) for the EMR emitters.  Other  means  of  protecting  the  ordnance  from  EMR  emitters  may  be  used  if  the ordnance  is  within  the  SSD.    This  is  applicable  for  all  S4  phases.    For  ordnance  on aircraft,  ground vehicles, etc., maintain a standoff distance  greater than the SSD for EMR  emitters  at  fixed  locations  to  mitigate  the  risk  of  HERO.    Guidance  for determining  SSDs  is  provided  by  Attachment  2.    For  HERO  uncertified  nuclear weapons  and  conventional  ordnance,  follow  guidance  provided  by  Attachment  10 until the ordnance is HERO certified.  After May 2018, uncertified ordnance shall be certified as HERO UNSAFE. 1.5.2.4.  Foreign  ordnance  requires  HERO  certification.    Ordnance  PMs  having foreign  ordnance  under  their  cognizance  may  request  test  data  and/or  analysis  from the  country  of  origin  indicating  compliance  with  MIL-STD-464  EME  levels  for HERO certification.  Otherwise the item shall be certified as HERO SUSCEPTIBLE or HERO UNSAFE, depending on the information provided. 1.5.3.  The  PM,  Acquisition  Manager,  or  Installation  Activity  employing  ordnance  on their  platforms  (aircraft,  ground  vehicles,  etc.)  shall  ensure  platform  EME  has  been characterized  either  by  test,  analysis,  and/or  a  combination  thereof.    The  EME characterization  shall  verify  that  intra-system  EME  does  not  pose  a  hazard  to  platform carried ordnance.  EME characterization shall be accomplished by May 2018.  If funding is not received until May 2018, EME characterization shall be due by May 2020.  System modifications  may  alter  the  baseline  EME  characterization.    Evaluate  modifications  for EME impact and adjust the baseline throughout the system lifecycle.  Resulting platform EME characterization will include all documentation achieved through testing, analysis, and/or  combination  thereof.    Additional  guidance  for  platform  EME  characterization  is provided in paragraph 4.3. AFI91-208  1 FEBRUARY 2017 7 1.5.4.  The  installation  Weapon  Safety  Manager  (WSM)  shall  prepare  and  maintain  the HERO survey package (Attachment 4).  (T-1). 2.  RESPONSIBILITIES. 2.1.

This  chapter  provides  guidance  on  the  procedures  used  to  obtain  HERO certification for ordnance. 3.1.2.  This  process  is  used  by  Air  Force  programs  responsible  for  the  design, development, test and evaluation, and sustainment of ordnance. 3.2.  Process. 3.2.1.  DoD  Manual  6055.09-M,  Volume  2,  requires  HERO  certification  of  all  DoD ordnance.    This  certification  covers  all  six-phases  of  the  S4  in  the  EME  identified  in MIL-STD-464, Table 9, and applies during the disposal of ordnance. 3.2.2.  The six-phases of the S4, as defined in MIL-HDBK-240, are as follows: AFI91-208  1 FEBRUARY 2017 11 3.2.2.1.  Transportation/Storage.    The  phase  in  which  the  ordnance  is  packaged, containerized,  or  otherwise  prepared  for  shipping  or  stored  in  an  authorized  storage facility.  This includes transporting of the ordnance. 3.2.2.2.  Assembly/Disassembly.    The  phase  involving  all  operations  required  for ordnance build-up or breakdown and typically involves personnel. 3.2.2.3.  Staged.  The phase where the ordnance has been prepared for loading and is pre-positioned in a designated staging area. 3.2.2.4.  Handling/Loading.    The  phase  where  physical  contact  is  made  between  the ordnance  item  and  personnel,  metal  objects,  or  structures  during  the  process  of preparing,  checking  out,  performing  built-in  test,  programming/reprogramming, installing, or attaching the ordnance item to its end-use platform/system; e.g., aircraft, launcher,  launch  vehicle,  or  personnel.    These  procedures  may  involve  making  or breaking  electrical  connections,  opening  and  closing  access  panels,  and removing/installing  safety  pins,  shorting  plugs,  clips,  and  dust  covers.    This configuration  also  includes  all  operations  required  for  unloading;  i.e.,  removing, disengaging, or repackaging the ordnance item. 3.2.2.5.  Platform-Loaded.  The phase where the ordnance item has been installed on or attached to  the host platform/system (e.g., aircraft, ground vehicle, and personnel and so forth) and all loading procedures have been completed. 3.2.2.6.  Immediate  Post-Launch.    The  phase  where  the  ordnance  item  has  been launched from its platform/system, but up to its SSD with regards to the actuation of its explosives, pyrotechnics, or propellants. 3.2.3.  PM  of  new  or  modified  ordnance  will  provide  information  to  the  HERO evaluation  organization  concerning  the  design,  development,  and  evaluation  schedules for items under their cognizance. 3.2.4.  PM will provide a list  of all affected CRCs, if applicable, anticipated deployable aircraft, ground vehicles, etc., with applicable launcher or bomb racks, and designates all subsystems containing EIDs be evaluated individually.  PM provides item nomenclature, CRC, DODIC, National Stock Number (NSN) (for existing ordnance), cognizant branch, field station, or contractor concerned with development or modification of the ordnance (Attachment 5), and anticipated period for various development phases.  This information is essential for planning and scheduling consultation, analysis, and/or test. 3.2.5.  HERO evaluation organization shall be either a DoD facility, e.g., Naval Surface Warfare  Center,  Dahlgren  Division  Laboratory,  E3  Assessment  and  Evaluation  Branch, B52, HERO PM, (540) 653-3445; United States Army White Sands Test Center, E3 Test Facility,  Electromagnetic  Effects  Division,  (575)  993-0885;  and  United  States  Army Redstone Test Center, System Engineering Directorate (256) 876-3556; or an appropriate contractor.  (T-1). 3.2.5.1.

PM  will  request  HERO  certification  (Attachment  6)  and  will  provide  the  HERO test and/or analysis report as rationale.  For HERO SUSCEPTIBLE or HERO UNSAFE certification, the PM will also provide a risk assessment.  PM will provide system CRC, if applicable, and component NSNs and DODICs.  This ensures production design is the same as the tested configuration with respect to HERO. 3.2.7.  Results  of  the  risk  assessment/acceptance  process  IAW  AFI  91-202  and  MIL-STD-882,  System  Safety,  latest  revision,  for  determining  the  relative  level  of  risk associated consequence and probability shall be submitted for all HERO SUSCEPTIBLE and  HERO  UNSAFE  certifications.    (T-1).    The  PM  will  ensure  the  risk  assessment  is based  upon  the  currently  available  set  of  E3  test  data  and/or  analysis  or  a  combination thereof and is assessed against the completeness, or lack thereof, versus Table A2.2 EME levels, illustrated in Figure A2.2, for HERO SUSCEPTIBLE and Table A2.1 EME levels, illustrated in Figure A2.1, for HERO UNSAFE. 3.2.8.  AFSEC/SEW  will  review  the  HERO  certification  request  along  with  supporting data and/or analysis and either approves or rejects the request as follows: 3.2.8.1.  If the ordnance is certified as HERO SAFE, the ordnance will be included in the  next  change/revision  of  JOERAD,  and  listed  by  AFSEC/SEW.    (T-1).  AFSEC/SEW retains the HERO certification on file and provides the PM a copy. 3.2.8.2.  If  not  certified  as  HERO  SAFE,  AFSEC/SEW  provides  justification.    The PM  may  authorize  corrective  actions  to  rectify  the  hazards  identified  by  the  HERO test, analysis, or combination thereof.  Funding for this activity is the responsibility of the  PM.    (T-1).    Otherwise  the  ordnance  shall  be  certified  as  HERO  UNSAFE  or HERO SUCEPTIBLE depending on the information provided.  The PM shall prepare AFI91-208  1 FEBRUARY 2017 13 a risk assessment as described in paragraph 3.2.7.  The ordnance will be included in the  next  change/revision  of  JOERAD  and  listed  by  AFSEC/SEW.   (T-1).  AFSEC/SEW retains the HERO certification on file and provides the PM a copy. 3.2.8.3.  If  the  system  requires  use  due  to  operational  necessity,  the  ordnance  is treated as HERO UNSAFE, until suitable modifications are fabricated, evaluated, and retrofitted.  (T-1). 3.2.9.  HERO certification is mandatory prior to fielding. 3.3.  HERO Assessments. 3.3.1.  A  HERO  assessment  is  necessary  to  support  test  and  evaluation  (e.g.,  to  support aircraft/store  compatibility)  any  time  prior  to  low  rate  initial  production  or  production approval. 3.3.2.  The  PEO/PM  requests  a  HERO  assessment  (Attachment  6)  from  AFSEC/SEW and provides test data and/or analysis to support the assessment. 3.3.3.  If  the  test  asset  contains  telemetry,  ensure  an  intersystem  HERO  test  and/or analysis is accomplished.  Provide AFSEC/SEW the telemetry antenna’s characteristics, such as frequency, antenna gain, and EMR emitter power to establish appropriate SSDs. 3.3.4.  Test  data  and/or  analysis  used  to  support  the  HERO  assessment  may  be  used  to support final HERO certification if modifications performed after HERO assessment do not directly affect the EIDs and/or their EMR susceptibility (Attachment 5). 3.3.5.  At  a  minimum,  the  PEO/PM  shall  provide  test  data  and/or  analysis  regarding  all EIDs that have a safety consequence.  If the PEO/PM accepts the risk that EIDs having a reliability consequence  might  dud or inadvertently fire, test data and/or  analysis are not required and the item shall be assessed for safety only. 4.  MAINTAINING SAFE HERO OPERATIONS. 4.1.  Overview. 4.1.1.  The  primary  method  to  protect  ordnance  from  EMR  hazards  is  to  ensure  the ordnance is never located where EMR electric field/power density is sufficiently high to couple  enough  electrical  energy  into  the  device  to  initiate  the  device  or  degrade performance.  In addition, shielding, filtering, bonding, grounding, or a combination may be used if an approved analysis and/or test supports protection against EME. 4.1.2.  HERO SAFE ordnance is considered unserviceable after exposure to EME above those defined in MIL-STD-464 and Attachment 9 of this publication due to the potential for  both  direct  EMR  induced  actuation  of  the  EIDs  and  inadvertent  activation  of  an electrically  powered  firing  circuit.    Report  the  unserviceable  condition  through appropriate Service channels. 4.1.3.  HERO SUSCEPTIBLE ordnance may not necessarily be susceptible to the levels in  Table  A2.2.    The  susceptibility  may  be  a  level  between  Table  A2.2  levels  and  MIL-STD-464  levels.    HERO  SUSCEPTIBLE  ordnance  is  considered  unserviceable  after exposure  to  EME  above  those  determined  by  analysis  or  testing  resulting  in  a  HERO SUSCEPTIBLE certification, due to the potential for both direct EMR induced actuation 14 AFI91-208  1 FEBRUARY 2017 of  the  EIDs  and  inadvertent  activation  of  an  electrically  powered  firing  circuit.    Report the unserviceable condition through appropriate Service channels. 4.1.4.  HERO  UNSAFE  ordnance  is  considered  unserviceable  after  exposure  to  EME above  those  defined  in  Table  A2.1  due  to  the  potential  for  both  direct  EMR  induced actuation of the EIDs and inadvertent activation of an electrically powered firing circuit.  Report the unserviceable condition through appropriate Service channels. 4.1.5.  The WSM shall clearly mark with warning symbols areas where the levels of RF electromagnetic  fields  constitutes  a  radiation  hazard  to  military  munitions  (Attachment 8).  (T-1). 4.2.  General  HERO  Requirements.    The  following  must  be  implemented  when  conducting operations  with  any  ordnance,  regardless  of  HERO  certification.    Personnel  handling ordnance shall: 4.2.1.  Plan  ordnance  operations  so  that  the  ordnance  has  a  minimal  exposure  to  EME.  Use the HERO survey package for guidance.  (T-1). 4.2.2.  Not  alter  ordnance  or  handle  umbilical  cables  and  cable  connectors  unless authorized or approved by technical order or higher authority.  (T-1). 4.2.3.  Not expose internal wiring and firing circuits by assembling or disassembling the ordnance, unless authorized by item technical order or higher authority.  (T-1). 4.2.4.  Transport all HERO UNSAFE and HERO SUSCEPTIBLE ordnance in sealed, all-metal  containers  whenever  possible,  which  is  considered  a  HERO  SAFE  configuration.  When transporting ordnance in a vehicle, the minimum SSD requirements are applicable.  (T-1). 4.2.5.  Treat  ordnance  containing  disassembled  EIDs  or  when  exposed  EIDs,  firing circuits, or wiring are present as HERO UNSAFE.  (T-1). 4.2.6.  Maintain a minimum SSD of 10 feet for HERO SAFE ordnance unless the EMR emitter effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) and frequency meet the criteria of Table A2.5,  then  the  minimum  SSD  listed  applies.    (T-1).    For  MME  SSD,  refer  to  guidance provided in paragraph 4.5.  For ordnance on a delivery platform, where a minimum of 10 feet may not be possible, platform PM must conduct an analysis and/or test proving the maximum  allowable  environment  (MAE)  of  the  ordnance  is  not  exceeded  (paragraph 4.3).  (T-1). 4.2.7.  Maintain  the  appropriate  SSD  for  HERO  UNSAFE  or  HERO  SUSCEPTIBLE ordnance.  If relying on a RADHAZ survey, ensure the EME does not exceed Table A2.1 levels  for  HERO  UNSAFE  ordnance  and,  when  no  measured  data  are  available,  Table A2.2 levels for HERO SUSCEPTIBLE ordnance.  If a RADHAZ survey is not available or  does  not  take  into  account  all  EMR  emitters  present,  determine  the  appropriate  SSD using guidance provided in Attachment 2.  (T-1).  If the EMR emitter is a MME, refer to guidance  provided  in  paragraph  4.5.    For  ordnance  on  a  delivery  platform,  where  the calculated SSD is not possible, platform PM must conduct an analysis and/or test proving the MAE of the ordnance is not exceeded (paragraph 4.3).  (T-1). 4.3.  EME Characterization Process for Platforms. AFI91-208  1 FEBRUARY 2017 15 4.3.1.  The characterization process for the host platform’s EME is a key step in weapon system  integration  process  and  supports  compliance  to  the  HERO  certification requirements.    This  process  is  applied  to  both  ground-based  and  airborne  platforms (airworthiness  requirements  are  defined  by  AFI  62-601  and  specifically  for  HERO  by MIL-HDBK-516,  Airworthiness  Certification  Criteria,  latest  revision).    Regardless  of ordnance  HERO  certification,  ordnance  must  be  integrated  onto  the  host platform  so  as not  to  exceed  the  safe  exposure  levels  of  EME  dictated  by  the  ordnance  certification.  This integration process is an assessment looking at the balance of locating the ordnance at a sufficient distance apart from on-board emitters in order to adhere to the SSD criteria of  the  given  ordnance.    To  properly  manage  that  balance,  knowledge  is  required  of  the ordnance  capability  to  withstand  EME  (i.e.,  HERO  certification)  and  the  host  platform emitters’ capability to produce EME. 4.3.2.  The following steps outline the platform EME characterization process.   The data can be acquired by accessing existing historical data, component/system testing, analysis, or a combination thereof: 4.3.2.1.  Ordnance  Locations.    A  full  list  of  ordnance  locations,  i.e.  station  (STA):  fuselage  station  (FS)/butt  line  (BL)/water  line  (WL),  on  the  platform  need  to  be known and cataloged prior to performing this analysis. 4.3.2.2.  Platform  Emitter  Data.    Obtain  the  following  data  for  each  emitter  on  the host platform to support EME characterization: 4.3.2.2.1.  Emitter  antenna FS/BL/WL. location(s)  on the  host  platform, i.e.,  STA:  4.3.2.2.2.  Emitter antenna transmit patterns, including side lobes and gain. 4.3.2.2.3.  Emitter  transmitter  power  characteristics,  i.e.,  peak  power,  average power, and duty cycle (DC). 4.3.2.2.4.  Frequency(ies) of operation of emitters and associated bandwidths. Note:  Item 4.3.2.2.1 is typically supplied by the host platform integrator.  Items 4.3.2.2.2, 4.3.2.2.3, and 4.3.2.2.4 are typically determined by examination of the emitter’s certification data sheet, i.e., DD Form 1494, Application for Equipment Frequency Allocation. 4.3.2.3.  SSD  Determination.    From  the  data  acquired  in  4.3.2.2,  determine  the EME/SSD at each ordnance location as it related to each of the three HERO ordnance certifications.  For HERO SAFE ordnance, EME levels must be less than MIL-STD-464  levels.    For  HERO  SUSCEPTIBLE  and  HERO  UNSAFE  ordnance,  calculate SSDs  IAW  Attachment  2  guidance.    In  cases  where  the  EME/SSD  is  not  met,  a corrective action to remedy the conflict must be accomplished or limitations shall be placed on the host platform to reduce or eliminate risk.  If a correction action cannot be  accomplished  and  the  situation  impacts  airworthiness,  ordnance  reliability,  or ordnance  premature  firing,  the  limitation  placed  upon  the  host  platform  or  the ordnance  to  reduce  or  eliminate  risk  shall  be  coordinated  and  accepted  by  the appropriate risk acceptance authority IAW AFI 62-601. 4.3.2.4.  Documentation.    Each  characterization  package  must  contain  a  cover memorandum with a cumulative HERO summation for the platform based on test or 16 AFI91-208  1 FEBRUARY 2017 engineering  analysis.    This  summation  is  the  most  restrictive  HERO  certification  of all  involved  ordnance.    A  risk  acceptance  package  is  required  for  each  ordnance location  not  meeting  MIL-STD-464  EME  levels  for  HERO  SAFE  ordnance.    Also, document  if  the  platform  cannot  accommodate  HERO  SUCEPTIBLE  or  HERO UNSAFE  ordnance  or  what  mitigation  steps  to  be  taken  to  reduce  the  EME  to accommodate such ordnance. 4.3.3.  The platform EME characterization process has been outlined to assist the weapon system integrator understand the key/critical aspects that the host platform EME plays in safe  weapon  integration.    There  are  several  caveats,  exceptions,  and  variables  that  can play into this process that are not explicitly defined herein. 4.3.3.1.  Typically, the platform EME characterization is performed using computer-based  calculations/equations  because  of  the  complexities  of  a  typical  host  platform geometry.    The  EME  and  resulting  SSDs  have  very  strong  dependency  upon  the geometry  of  the  platform,  the  complexity  of  the  emitter  radiation  patterns  and  side lobes,  reflections,  multiple  antenna  locations  and  cavities/enclosed  weapons  bays.  Also, variables such as transmitter DCs, modulations, power settings, and equipment with classified performance parameters add to the overall complexity of the analysis.  In  some  cases,  it  is  prudent  and  sufficient  to  make  simplifying  assumptions  to  keep calculations in a first order line of sight SSD calculation (Attachment 2).  When these simplifications yield noncompliant EME, SSDs, or overly severe limitations, a more detailed analysis or in some cases testing will be required. 4.3.3.2.  EME  characterization  process  shall  be  performed  by  an  experienced  E3 engineer  who  has  detailed  knowledge  of  the  host  platform’s  electromagnetic performance  characteristics.    This  responsibility  typically  falls  upon  the  platform’s PM technical staff such as the Chief Engineer, or the platform contractor responsible for  E3  integration.    Additional  technical  support  for  consultation  and/or  performing these assessments can be provided by the Air Force E3 subject matter experts.  Their contact at https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/AFLCMCEZA/E3/SitePages/Home.aspx. information found can be 4.4.  Traditional Fixed-Location Emitter (TFE)/Mobile Emitter (ME). 4.4.1.  TFEs are in a fixed location, usually mounted on a tower, mast, or rooftop.  MEs are similar to TFEs except they can be moved to different locations. 4.4.2.  Determine  the  EME  utilizing  the  RADHAZ  survey  or  determine  the  SSD  using guidance  provided  in  Attachment  2.    If  the  minimum  distance  (SSD)  is  maintained between  the  ordnance  and  the  TFE/ME,  the  EMR  electric  field/power  density  at  the location of the ordnance, even under optimal transmission and coupling conditions, is too low to provide sufficient energy to initiate or degrade the EIDs within the ordnance. 4.4.3.  WSM  shall  evaluate  the  potential  for  HERO,  i.e.,  HERO  certification,  SSD, RADHAZ  survey  results,  etc.,  for  all  explosive  locations  with  ordnance.    This information is documented in the HERO survey package. 4.5.  Modern  Mobile  Emitter  (MME).    MMEs  may  emit  lower  power  levels  than conventional EMR emitters (TFEs/MEs), but may also be brought much closer to ordnance AFI91-208  1 FEBRUARY 2017 17 even into the near-field of their antenna.  MMEs, such as cellular telephones, active pagers, tablets, and some walkie-talkies automatically emit EMR without operator action. 4.5.1.  Use of  a MME less  than a SSD of 10 feet requires  approval  from  AFSEC/SEW, which determine SSDs using Table A2.5. 4.5.1.1.  The  installation  safety  office,  the  unit  needing  to  use  the  MME,  or  the  PM responsible  for  purchasing  and/or  issuing  the  MME  shall  request  approval  for  use from  AFSEC/SEW  and  provide  the  average  output  power,  antenna  gain,  and frequency(ies),  actual  EMR  test  data,  and/or  Federal  Communications  Commission (FCC) identification to AFSEC/SEW. 4.5.1.2.  AFSEC/SEW  responds  with  an  approval  memorandum  documenting  the appropriate SSDs thirty days after receiving the request. 4.5.1.3.  A  list  of  approved  MMEs  is  maintained  by  AFSEC/SEW  at  the  HERO website, https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/afsec/HERO/default.aspx. 4.5.1.4.  Organizations  employing  these  devices  must  address  other  hazards  and security  concerns  with  their  MAJCOM.    Final  authority  for  use  resides  with  the MAJCOM. 4.5.2.  MMEs  authorized  for  use  in  storage,  build-up,  and  assembly  areas  where ammunition and explosives are present, shall not be connected to power via power cords.  Batteries  shall  not  be  charged  in  the  magazines,  in  storage,  build-up,  or  assembly  areas when  ammunition  and  explosives  are  present  due  to  the  possibility  of  the  batteries exploding. 4.5.3.  Multiple  MMEs  (two  or  more)  are  not  authorized  in  enclosed,  reflective  spaces such  as  magazines  or  facilities  where  ordnance  is  stored  or  built-up;  the  aggregated effects on the ambient or volumetric electromagnetic field in those spaces may increase as  a  results  of  complex  cavity  effects,  unless  authorized  by  AFSEC/SEW.    If  the RADHAZ survey included the use of two or more AFSEC/SEW approved MMEs while maintaining  EME  levels  that  did  not  exceed  HERO  EME  levels  for  ordnance  (HERO SAFE, HERO SUSCEPTIBLE, or HERO UNSAFE), multiple MMEs are permissible. 4.5.4.  All  remote  entry  devices  including  car  entry  keys  in  compliance  with  Code  of Federal  Regulations  (CFR),  Title  47,  Telecommunication,  Part  15,  Radio  Frequency Devices, paragraph 15.231, Periodic operation in the band 40.66-40.70 MHz and above 70 MHz, are only restricted from coming into physical contact with ordnance, regardless of certification.  Remote entry devices not in compliance with regulations or not properly labeled must maintain a SSD of 10 feet.  If a planned operation occurs outside the United States where FCC regulations are not applicable, request assistance from AFSEC/SEW. 4.6.  Other EMR Emitters. 4.6.1.  The PM Joint-Automatic Identification Technology (PM J-AIT) is testing radiated emission  from  RFID  and  AIT  equipment  for  near-field  operation  using  worst-case guidance limitations.  Observe the SSD calculated, approved, and published by PM J-AIT for individual pieces of equipment applicable to munitions operations. 4.6.2.  Items,  such  as  desktop  computers,  laptops,  tablets,  associated  hardware  (such  as printer,  mice,  etc.),  etc.,  not  configured  with  radiating  wireless  capability,  e.g.,  cellular, 18 AFI91-208  1 FEBRUARY 2017 Wi-Fi,  Bluetooth,  etc.,  are  authorized  for  use  in  storage,  build-up,  and  assembly  areas where ordnance are present with the following restrictions: 4.6.2.1.  Items shall be certified to meet CFR, Title 47,  Telecommunication, Part 15, Radio Frequency Devices, Class A or B limits and labeled accordingly.  They require no  SSD  and  can  be  used  in  close  proximity  but  cannot  come  in  direct  contact  with ordnance regardless of certification.  If the item is not properly labeled or cannot be determined to meet the appropriate regulation, a SSD of 10 feet applies.  If a planned operation occurs outside the United States where FCC regulations are not applicable, request assistance from AFSEC/SEW. 4.6.2.2.  Items with RF wireless capabilities are considered MMEs and paragraph 4.5 applies. 4.7.  Nuclear Weapons. 4.7.1.  Guidance  for  maintaining  safe  HERO  operations  when  nuclear  weapons  and components are involved is provided in Attachment 7. 4.8.  X-Rays. 4.8.1.  Damage  to  explosives,  resulting  from  exposure  to  X-ray  radiation,  is  related  to total dose, exposure time (dose rate in some instances), and the physical properties of the material.  With the addition of a safety margin, the X-ray rate dose will not exceed 1,400 rads/minute,  and/or  the  total  dosage  will  not  exceed  100,000  rads.    Under  these conditions,  no  HERO  problems  are  expected  and  explosives  should  remain  safe  and reliable.  Total doses exceeding 100,000 rads will likely change decomposition rates and increase the time to explosion.  ANDREW M.

receive electromagnetic energy. Antenna  Gain—Antenna gain  (G) is  a performance figure combining the antenna’s directivity and electrical  efficiency.   In an antenna, antenna gain  describes how well  the antenna converts input  power  into  electromagnetic  fields  headed  in  a  specific  direction.    In  a  receiving  antenna, antenna  gain  describes  how  well  the  antenna  converts  electromagnetic  fields  arriving  from  a specific  direction  into  electrical  power.    For  the  purposes  of  this  instruction,  antenna  gain  is expressed in dBi, unless otherwise noted. Bridgewire—A  metal  wire  heated  by  the  passage  of  electrical  current,  which  initiates  the deflagration or detonation charge surrounding the wire. Continuous  Signal—An  emitter  producing  uninterrupted  electromagnetic  energy.    Amplitude modulation, frequency modulation, and phase modulation are considered continuous because the electromagnetic  energy  is  continuously  present.    The  power  may  vary  with  time  due  to modulation, but electromagnetic energy is always present. Dudding—The  inability  of  the  EIDs  to  function  as  intended  because  the  physical/electrical properties have been altered due to the application or repeated application of energy below that required to initiate the device. Effective Isotropic Radiated Power—Effect isotropic radiated power (EIRP) is the amount of power  in  watts  a  theoretical  isotropic  antenna  would  emit  to  produce  a  peak  power  density observed in the direction of maximum antenna gain. Electric Field Strength—Electric field strength (E) is the magnitude of the electric field vector with units of volts (V) per meter (V/m). Electromagnetic  Environment—Electromagnetic  environment  (EME)  is  the  resulting  product of  the  power  and  time  distribution,  in  various  frequency  ranges,  of  the  radiated  or  conducted electromagnetic emission levels that may be encountered by a military force, system, or platform when  performing  its  assigned  mission  in  its  intended  operational  environment  (in  the  case  of ordnance,  during  its  S4).    It  is  dynamically  comprised  of  electromagnetic  energy  from  a multitude  of  natural  sources,  such  as  lightning,  precipitation  static  (p-static),  electrostatic discharge, galactic and stellar noise, and so forth, and man-made sources, such as electrical and electronic  systems,  RF  systems,  electromagnetic  devices,  ultra-wideband  systems,  high-power microwaves  systems,  and  so  forth.    When  defined,  the  EME  will  be  for  a  particular  time  and place.  Specific equipment characteristics, such as operating frequencies and EMR emitter power levels,  operational  factors,  such  as  distance  between  items  and  force  structure  and  frequency coordination, all contribute to the EME. Electromagnetic  Environmental  Effects—Electromagnetic  environmental  effects  (E3)  is  the impact  of the EME upon the operational  capability of military forces, equipment,  systems,  and platform/systems.    It  encompasses  all  electromagnetic  disciplines,  including  electromagnetic compatibility;  electromagnetic  interference;  electromagnetic  vulnerability;  electromagnetic pulse; electronic protection; electrostatic discharge; and hazards of electromagnetic radiation to personnel, ordnance, and volatile materials such as fuel; and includes the electromagnetic effects 24 AFI91-208  1 FEBRUARY 2017 generated by all EME contributors including RF systems; ultra-wideband devices; high-powered microwaves systems; p-static; and so forth. Frequency—For a period function, frequency (f) is the number of cycles or events per unit time measured in hertz (Hz) or cycles per second.   Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance—MIL-HDBK-240 defines hazards of electromagnetic radiation to ordnance (HERO) as the situation in which exposure to external EME results in specified safety or reliability margins of EIDs or electrically powered ordnance firing circuits to be exceeded, or EIDs to be inadvertently actuated.  MIL-STD-464 and MIL-HDBK-240 define HERO SAFE, HERO SUSCEPTIBLE, and HERO UNSAFE as follows:  HERO Safe—Any ordnance item that is sufficiently shielded or otherwise so protected that all EIDs contained by the item are immune to adverse effects (safety and reliability) when the item is employed in the RF environment delineated in MIL-STD-464.  The general HERO requirements defined in the hazards from EMR manuals must still be observed.  HERO Susceptible—Any ordnance item containing EIDs proven by test or analysis to be adversely affected by EMR to the point that the safety and/or reliability of the system is in jeopardy when the system is employed in the EME delineated in MIL-STD-464.  HERO Unsafe—Any ordnance item containing EIDs not certified as HERO SAFE or HERO SUSCEPTIBLE as a result of a HERO analysis or test.  Additionally, any ordnance item containing EIDs (including those previously certified as HERO SAFE or HERO SUSCEPTIBLE) that has its internal wiring exposed; when tests are being conducted on that item resulting in additional electrical connections to the item; when EIDs having exposed wire leads are present and handled or loaded in any but the tested condition; when the item is being assembled or disassembled; or when such ordnance items are damaged causing exposure of internal wiring or components or destroying engineered HERO protective devices.  HERO Margin—HERO margin is the difference between the maximum no-fire stimulus and the permissible EID response level.  For EIDs used in conventional ordnance, the margin is AFI91-208  1 FEBRUARY 2017 25 defined in MIL-STD-464 as 16.5 dB for EIDs having a safety consequence and 6 dB for EIDs having a reliability consequence.  For nuclear weapons, the margin is defined as 16.5 dB for EIDs having a safety consequence only.  For Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs), when exposed to the EME levels specified in MIL-STD-464, the maximum root-mean-squared (rms) current in its bridgewire shall be 20 dB below the maximum no-fire current of the EIDs having a safety consequence only.  No HERO Requirement—No HERO requirement (NHR) is a category of ordnance that do not contain EIDs.  The ordnance may be totally inert or it may contain explosive material that cannot be initiated by RF energy.  These items are not subject to HERO testing/analysis or the HERO requirements of Services’ publications.  These items may be included in the ordnance databases as NHR ordnance.  Maximum Allowable Environment—Maximum allowable environment (MAE) is the highest radiated electric field strength levels to which ordnance can be exposed to without exceeding EID HERO margins.  Mission Critical—Unless otherwise defined in the procurement specification, a term applied to a condition, event, operating, process, or item which if performed improperly, may:  1) prohibit execution of mission, 2) significantly reduce the operational capability, or 3) significantly increase system vulnerability.  Mobile Emitter—Mobile emitters (MEs) are similar to a TFE except they can move, e.g., mobile ATC system, AN/TPS-75 radar system, etc.  MEs must be tracked by the ISM and WSM.  Mode Stirring and Reverberation—Mode stirring and reverberation testing are RF techniques whose goals are to describe an enclosed space stochastically in terms of the distribution of the electric fields due to energy that may be within the space, either through internal EMR emitters or leakage into the space from external sources.  They are particularly useful for describing the frequency response of aircraft weapon compartments which are often very complex structures.  The tests are performed such that the boundary conditions of the compartment are maintained constant while the frequency of the RF radiation is allowed to vary over a narrow interval about some center frequency.  The contributions of each reverberant mode to a given spatial point in the compartment, known as eigen-modes, are averaged over each narrow frequency band tested resulting in an approximation of the field homogenicity within the compartment.  The results allow an evaluation of the likelihood of fields at, above, or below certain levels.  Modern Mobile Emitter—Modern mobile emitters (MMEs) have the capability of moving with respect to the location of the EIDs, as well as any other low power EMR emitters, part of modern communication and data systems, e.g., cellular telephones, barcode readers, RFID devices, wireless laptops, tablets, network access points, and any other EMR emitter potentially brought close to EIDs.  Ordnance—Explosives, chemicals, pyrotechnics, and similar stores, e.g., bombs, guns and ammunition, flares, smoke, or napalm). 26 AFI91-208  1 FEBRUARY 2017 Power Density—Power density (Pd) is the power flow per unit area with units of W/m2 or mW/cm2.  Average power density is the quantity related to the heating properties of EMR and, hence, to personnel and other hazards, while peak power density becomes important in the study of the effects to electromagnetic fields on EIDs and on fuel hazards.  Pulse-Modulated Signal—Electromagnetic energy transmitted by pulse-modulated radars consists of a series of equally spaced pulses separated by very short but relatively long periods during which no electromagnetic energy is transmitted.  The pulse width (pw) is the duration of the radar pulse.  The pulse repetition frequency (prf) is the number of pulses per second.  Peak power of the system is the power of the transmitter contained in the radiated pulses.  Because the radar is resting for a time that is long with respect to the operating time, the average power delivered during one cycle of operating is relatively low compared with the peak power available during the pulse time.  The operating cycle of the radar can be described in terms of the fraction of the total time electromagnetic energy is radiated.  This time relationship is the DC.  Reliability Consequence—The inadvertent actuation of an EID that does not result in a safety consequence, but degrades system performance; i.e., renders the ordnance item either ineffective or unable to function as intended.  In addition, the definition has been expanded to include dudding where the system would no longer be reliable.  Safe Separation Distance—Safe separation distance (SSD) for HERO is the calculated distance, in feet or meters, from an EMR emitter beyond which the radiated power density from the EMR emitter has decreased to a level too low to couple enough energy into the EIDs to initiate detonation.  Measurements of the SSD may take into account both the horizontal and vertical difference in length and height between the EMR emitter and the EIDs.  Safety Consequence—The inadvertent actuation of an EID that creates an immediate catastrophic event with the potential to either destroy equipment or injure personnel, such as the firing of an inline rocket motor igniter by EMR energy; or the inadvertent actuation of an EID that increases the probability of a future catastrophic event by removing or otherwise disabling a safety feature or the ordnance item.  This, e.g., might be caused by the EMR initiation of a piston actuator that removes a lock of the safety-and-arming rotor of an artillery fuze, thus allowing a sensitive detonator to rotate-in-line with the explosive train.  Stockpile-to-Safe Separation Sequence—Stockpile-to-safe separation sequence (S4), which consists of six phases as defined in MIL-HDBK-240, are as follows:  Transportation/Storage—The phase in which the ordnance is packaged, containerized, or otherwise prepared for shipping or stored in an authorized storage facility.  This includes transporting of the ordnance.  Assembly/Disassembly—The phase involving all operations required for ordnance build-up or breakdown and typically involves personnel.  Staged—The phase where the ordnance has been prepared for loading and is pre-positioned in a designated staging area. AFI91-208  1 FEBRUARY 2017 27 Handling/Loading—The phase where physical contact is made between the ordnance item and personnel, metal objects, or structures during the process of preparing, checking out, performing built-in test, programming/reprogramming, installing, or attaching the ordnance item to its end-use platform/system; e.g., aircraft, launcher, launch vehicle, or personnel.  These procedures may involve making or breaking electrical connections, opening and closing access panels, and removing/installing safety pins, shorting plugs, clips, and dust covers.  This configuration also includes all operations required for unloading; i.e., removing, disengaging, or repackaging the ordnance item.  Platform-Loaded—The phase where the ordnance item has been installed on or attached to the host platform/system (e.g., aircraft, ground vehicle, and personnel and so forth) and all loading procedures have been completed.  Immediate Post-Launch—The phase where the ordnance item has been launched from its platform/system, but up to its SSD with regards to the actuation of its explosives, pyrotechnics, or propellants.  Symbols and Units—The following are symbols and units used in this instruction: c–speed of light (3x108 meters/second) cm–centimeter d–antenna maximum linear distance dB–decibel dBd–decibels related to dipole antenna dBi–decibel isotropic dBm– decibel milliwatt dBW–decibel watt E–electric field strength EMAE–maximum allowable environment electric field strength f–frequency FF–far-field region G–antenna gain GdBd–antenna gain relative to a dipole antenna GdBi–antenna gain expressed in decibel isotropic GHz–Gigahertz Gt–numerical (far-field) antenna gain ratio Hz–Hertz i–number of traditional fixed-location emitters kHz–kilohertz AFI91-208  1 FEBRUARY 2017 28 λ–wavelength MHz–Megahertz m–meter mW–milliwatt NFr–reactive near-field region NFrad–radiating near-field region Ω–ohm π–pi (3.14159) Pa–average power Pd–power density Pp–peak power Pt–EMR emitter power r–distance or range from an antenna SSDi–safe separation distance for each traditional fixed-location emitter SSDm–safe separation distance for multiple traditional fixed-location emitter ∑–summation operator V–volt V/m–volts per meter V/m-rms–volts per meter-root-mean-squared W–watt Z0–intrinsic impedance of free space, approximately 120π Ω or 377 Ω  Traditional Fixed-Location Emitter–Traditional fixed-location emitters (TFEs) are all EMR emitters traditionally tracked by the ISM.  These EMR emitters are in a fixed location, usually mounted on a tower, mast, or rooftop.  United States–The several States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealths of Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, Guam, Midway and Wake Islands, the U.S. Virgin Islands, any other territory or possession of the United States, and associated navigable waters, contiguous zones, and ocean waters of which the natural resources are under the exclusive management authority of the United States.  AFI91-208  1 FEBRUARY 2017 29 Attachment 2 SAFE SEPARATON DISTANCE (SSD) A2.1.  Maximum Allowable Environment (MAE). A2.1.1.  For ordnance certified as HERO UNSAFE, the MAE electric field strength (EMAE) is defined in Table A2.1 and illustrated in Figure A2.1. Table A2.1.  EMAE for HERO UNSAFE Ordnance. Figure A2.1.  HERO UNSAFE EMAE Curve.  A2.1.2.  For ordnance certified as HERO SUSCEPTIBLE, the minimum EMAE is  defined in Table A2.2 and illustrated in Figure A2.2.  30 AFI91-208  1 FEBRUARY 2017 Table A2.2.  EMAE for HERO SUSCEPTIBLE Ordnance. Figure A2.2.  HERO SUSCEPTIBLE EMAE Curve.  A2.1.3.  Ordnance  certified  as  HERO  SUSCEPTIBLE  may  have  a  MAE  that  is  less restrictive  than  the  MAE  presented  in  the  general  HERO  curve  given  in  Table  A2.2  and illustrated  in  Figure  A2.2.    Equations  given  in  Table  A2.4  allow  for  a  calculated  SSD  for HERO SUSCEPTIBLE when no measured data are available.  A2.2.  Near- and Far-Field Regions. A2.2.1.  The  electromagnetic  fields  around  an  antenna  are  divided  into  three  regions:    the reactive  near-field,  radiating  near-field  (Fresnel  Region),  and  the  far-field  (Fraunhofer Region) which are illustrated in Figure A2.3. AFI91-208  1 FEBRUARY 2017 31 Figure A2.3.  Antenna Field Regions.  A2.2.2.  The reactive near-field always exists around a radiating antenna.  But if the antenna is small compared to the wavelength (λ > 10d), the radiating near-field (Fresnel Region) will not  exist.    λ  is  the  wavelength  and  d  is  the  largest  linear  dimension  of  the  antenna.    If  an antenna is not radiating, no fields exist. A2.2.3.  The reactive near-field is closest to the source (i.e., EMR emitters).  In this region, the electromagnetic energy does not behave like EMR because it does not radiate away from the  source.    The  changing  electrical  potential  in  the  antenna  separates  the  moving  charges thereby  producing  an  electric  dipole  field  (i.e.,  electric  charge  of  equal  magnitude  but opposite signs, positive versus negative) and magnetic dipole field (i.e., a closed circulation of  electric  current)  where  the  electromagnetic  energy  oscillates  back  and  forth  so  that  any energy not received by a receiver is returned to the source instead of radiating away from it.  The reactive near-field is capable of only affecting receivers close by (e.g., feedback within the  source,  magnetic  induction  inside  a  nearby  electrical  transformer,  increased  load  in  the source, etc.). A2.2.3.1.  The reactive near-field extends from the antenna a distance of:  A2.2.3.2.  For  the  reactive  near-field  region,  the  equation  is  valid  for  all  types  of antennas.    This  guidance  assumes  that  most  radar  antennas  behave  as  aperture  type antennas and most communication antennas behave as wire antennas. A2.2.4.  In the radiated near-field, the EMR travels away from the source in a straight beam about the size of the aperture’s projected area with the power level remaining fairly constant with  distance.    In  this  region  the  source’s  terminal  voltage,  impedance,  and  driver  current affect the electric and magnetic fields comprising the EMR causing them to vary at different rates  where  one  field  becomes  dominant.    This  means  that  these  field  do  not  exhibit  a 32 AFI91-208  1 FEBRUARY 2017 constant  ratio  of  120π  Ω,  approximately  377  Ω,  the  intrinsic  impedance  of  free  space.  However,  as  the  EMR  approaches  the  far-field,  the  ratio  of  the  two  fields  begins approximating 377 Ω, the variation between them lessens, and they settle into phase. A2.2.5.  The  vast  majority  of  radar  antennas  can  be  treated  as  aperture  antennas  while  the vast majority of communication antennas can be treated as wire antennas. A2.2.5.1.  For  most  radar  antennas  (apertures  antennas),  the  near-field  (radiating  near-field if it exists, otherwise the reactive near-field) extends from the antenna a distance of:  A2.2.5.2.  For  communication  antennas  (wire  antennas)  the  near-field  extends  to  one wavelength (λ) from the antenna:  A2.2.6.  The far-field is the region in which the antenna is focused.  At the leading edge of the  far-field  the  radiated  beam  from  the  source  starts  to  spread  out.    This  means  that  the power density along the beam axis decreases with distance until the antenna becomes a point source and the power density obeys the inverse square law. A2.2.6.1.  The boundary between the near-field and the far-field for apertures antennas is:  AFI91-208  1 FEBRUARY 2017 33 A2.2.6.2.  The boundary between the near-field and the far-field for wire antennas is:  A2.2.7.  The antenna maximum linear dimension is the length of the longest dimension of the antenna itself.  For example, a parabolic dish, the dimension is the diameter of the dish.  For any  other  shape,  use  the  longest  single  dimension,  which  could  be  diagonal  across  a rectangular element such as a grid sectional parabolic antenna. A2.2.8.  In the far-field region of an antenna, the power density and electric field are related to each other by the intrinsic impedance of free space: A2.2.8.1.  In the far-field, assuming a lossless system, the power density of a directional antenna is:   A2.2.8.2.  This equation is generally accurate in the far-field of an antenna but will over-predict power density when close to the antenna, or in the near-field, making worst case or conservative prediction. A2.2.9.  Most  EMR  emitters  either  produce  continuous  or  pulse-modulated  signals.    A continuous EMR emitter produces uninterrupted  RF such as  from  an oscillator.  Amplitude modulation, frequency modulation, and phase modulation are considered continuous because the RF is continuously present.  The power may vary with time due to modulation, but RF is 34 AFI91-208  1 FEBRUARY 2017 always present.  For pulse-modulated signals, typically radars, have differences between peak and average rms power. A2.2.9.1.  Determine the average power by using the ratio of time-on and time-off over an interval.  The time-on/off is the DC: A2.2.9.2.  The product of the peak power and DC is the average power:   A2.2.9.3.  EMR emitter power is equal to peak power for pulse-modulated systems with pw one millisecond or greater or average power for pw less than one millisecond. A2.2.10.  The numerical (far-field) antenna gain ratio, not the dBi value, of an antenna can be determined from the antenna gain expressed in dBi:  A2.2.10.1.  Decibel isotropic is the measurement of antenna gain in a directional antenna compared  with  a  theoretical  isotropic  antenna  radiating  the  exact  same  energy  in  all directions.  Gain may also be expressed relative to a dipole antenna with units of dBd. A2.2.10.2.  Convert from dBd to dBi:  A2.2.11.  Assuming  a  lossless  system,  EIRP  is  the  product  of  EMR  emitter  power  and numerical (far-field) antenna gain ratio: AFI91-208  1 FEBRUARY 2017 35  A2.2.11.1.  For EIRP in terms of power ratio, EMR emitter power to a milliwatt, with a unit of decibel milliwatt (dBm), or EMR emitter power to one watt, with a unit of decibel watt (dBW), use the following equations to convert from dBm or dBW to watts:  A2.2.11.2.  In some cases, the EMR emitter power may be expressed in terms of effective radiated power (ERP) instead of EIRP.  EPR is referenced to a half-wave dipole radiator instead  of  an  isotropic  radiator.    To  convert  ERP  to  EIRP,  multiply  ERP  by  a  factor  of 1.64, the antenna gain of a half-wave dipole antenna relative to an isotropic radiator:  A2.2.12.  In  the  near-field  region  of  an  antenna,  determination  of  electromagnetic  field characteristics is more complicated.  The electric and magnetic fields are generally dependent on the source of the radiation and can vary with both angular position and distance around an antenna.  Furthermore, the wave impedance of the radiation is no longer a constant value, as it  was  in  the  far-field  region.    Determine  the  electric  field/power  density  at  the  near-field using  guidance  provided  in  Technical  Order  31Z-10-4,  Joint  Services  Command,  Control, Communication, and Computer Systems Electromagnetic Radiation Hazards, latest revision, or MIL-HDBK-235-1, Military Operational Electromagnetic Environment Profiles, Part 1C, General Guidance, latest revision. A2.2.13.  A prediction  for electric field/power density in  the far-field  of the antenna can be made by using the equations in paragraph A2.2.8.  These equations are generally accurate in the far-field of an antenna but will over-predict electric field/power density when close to the antenna,  or  in  the  near-field.    In  this  case  they  are  used  for  making  a  worst  case  or conservative  prediction.    Therefore,  equations  in  paragraph  A2.3  take  this  assumption  into consideration and the resulting SSD equations are considered conservative predictions. A2.3.  TFE/MEs. A2.3.1.  The  following  SSD  determinations  apply  to  situation  involving  TFEs/MEs  and HERO  certified  ordnance.    (T-1).    A  RADHAZ  survey  provides  actual  measured  data  and 36 AFI91-208  1 FEBRUARY 2017 can  be  used  if  the  EME  exceeds  the  required  levels.    Otherwise  use  the  following  to determine the SSD in situation involving TFEs/MEs and HERO certified ordnance. A2.3.2.  HERO SAFE ordnance.  Maintain a minimum SSD of 10 feet.  If the EMR emitter EIRP  and  frequency(ies)  meet  the  criteria  of  Table  A2.5,  the  minimum  SSD  listed  applies; otherwise the minimum SSD is 10 feet. A2.3.3.  HERO UNSAFE ordnance.  If the EMR emitter EIRP and frequency(ies) meets the criteria of Table A2.5, the minimum SSD listed applies.  Otherwise calculate the SSD using equations in Table A2.3.  If the calculated SSD is less than 10 feet, then the resulting SSD is 10 feet. A2.3.4.  HERO  SUSCEPTIBLE  ordnance.    If  the  EMR  emitter  EIRP  and  frequency(ies) meets  the  criteria  of  Table  A2.5,  when  no  measured  data  are  available,  the  minimum  SSD listed  applies.    Otherwise  calculate  the  SSD  using  equations  in  Table  A2.4,  when  no measured  data  are  available.    If  the  calculated  SSD  is  less  than  10  feet,  then  the  resulting SSD is 10 feet. A2.3.5.  For TFEs/MEs  that operate over a frequency band and maintain similar power and antenna gain over the frequency band, apply the following guidance: A2.3.5.1.  If  the  EMR  emitter’s  frequency  band  has  a  start  or  lower  frequency  greater than 80 MHz, use the lowest frequency to determine the SSD for the frequency band. A2.3.5.2.  If the EMR emitter’s frequency band has an end or upper frequency less than 2 MHz, use the highest frequency to determine the SSD for the frequency band. A2.3.5.3.  If  the  EMR  emitter’s  frequency  band  has  a  start  or  lower  frequency  greater than or equal  to 2 MHz and an end or upper frequency less  than 80 MHz, calculate the SSD using the formula for the frequency range of 2.0 MHz ≤ f < 80 MHz because this is the worst case SSD for the frequency band. A2.3.6.  For  continuous  systems  and  pulse-modulated  systems,  with  pw  less  than  one millisecond, the EMR emitter power is average power and for pulse-modulated systems with pw one millisecond or greater the EMR emitter power is peak power. A2.3.7.  For  frequency(ies)  outside  the  range  specified  in  Tables  A2.3,  A2.4,  and  A2.5, request assistance from AFSEC/SEW. AFI91-208  1 FEBRUARY 2017 37 Table A2.3.  Equations for Computing SSDs for HERO UNSAFE Ordnance.  38 AFI91-208  1 FEBRUARY 2017 Table A2.4.  Equations for Computing SSDs for HERO SUSCEPTIBLE Ordnance. A2.4.  Multiple TFEs/MEs. A2.4.1.  For  multiple  TFEs/MEs  that  are  collocated  and  operating  in  phase,  the  SSD  is determined as:   A2.4.2.  For  multiple  TFEs/MEs  operating  at  different  frequency/bands,  the  largest individual SSD applies.   AFI91-208  1 FEBRUARY 2017 39 A2.5.  Minimum SSD Exceptions. A2.5.1.  There are exception whereby EMR emitters are expected to be, or are required to be, closer than 10 feet to HERO certified ordnance.  Their proximity to HERO certified ordnance and low-power EMR emitters require different techniques for mitigating HERO. A2.5.2.  Table A2.5 is  used for TFEs/MEs  if the EIRP  and frequency(ies) requirements are met.    AFSEC/SEW  uses  Table  A2.5  when  determining  the  appropriate  SSD  for  MMEs.  Multiple  MMEs  (two  or  more)  are  not  allowed  in  enclosed,  reflective  spaces  or  facilities where  conventional  ordnance  are  stored  or  undergoing  maintenance;  the  aggregated  effects on the ambient or volumetric electromagnetic field in those spaces may increase as a result of complex  cavity  effect,  unless  a  RADHAZ  survey  proves  otherwise  and  if  approved  by AFSEC/SEW.  (T-1). Table A2.5.  Minimum SSD Exceptions for HERO Certified Ordnance. A2.6.  Examples for Calculating SSDs. A2.6.1.  Scenario  1.    HERO  SUSCEPTIBLE  ordnance  exposed  to  power  density  of  450 W/m2 at a frequency of 200 MHz. Step 1.  Using the formula for electrical field strength, paragraph A2.2.8, convert the power density to the electric field strength (V/m-rms):  40 AFI91-208  1 FEBRUARY 2017 Step 2.  Using Table A2.2, determine EMAE for HERO SUSCEPTIBLE ordnance:  Step 3.  Compare the EMAE and the electric field strength, determined from the power density.  The ordnance exposure is 412 V/m-rms.  The EMAE is 5 V/m-rms.  The situation is unacceptable.  Therefore, the ordnance must be moved to an area where the electric field is lower than 5 V/m-rms or power density is less than 0.066 W/m2 or the EMR emitter must be turned off.  A2.6.2.  Scenario 2.   HERO SUSCEPTIBLE ordnance exposed to  continuous EMR emitter having  a  frequency  of  300  MHz,  EMR  emitter  power  of  1,000  W,  and  antenna  gain  of  15 dBi. Step 1.  The numerical (far-field) antenna gain ratio is: Step 2.  Determine the EIRP (W) using the numerical antenna gain ratio and Pt = 1,000 W:  Step 3.  The ordnance is certified as HERO SUSCEPTIBLE, therefore use the formula from Table A2.4.  Because the frequency is 300 MHz, the applicable formula, in feet, is:  A2.6.3.  Scenario 3.  Considered the site where the antennas are collocated on a tower, where two  of  the  five  antennas  are  operating  in  phase  and  at  the  same  frequency,  and  have characteristics listed in Table A2.6.  Table A2.6.  Scenario 4.  Antenna Characteristics. Step 1.  Convert EIRP from dBm to watts using the formula from paragraph A2.2.12, resulting in values listed in Table A2.7:   AFI91-208  1 FEBRUARY 2017 41 Table A2.7.  Scenario 4.  EIRP (W). Step 2.  Calculate the SSDs based on equations from Tables A2.3 and A2.4 for HERO UNSAFE and HERO SUSCEPTIBLE ordnance, respectively, resulting in values listed in Table A2.8.  Table A2.8.  Scenario 4.  Individual TFE SSDs. Step 3.  For the two antennas, antennas 1 and 2, operating at 1,930 MHz, in phase, and are collocated, the SSD based on multiple TFEs is determined using the formulas from paragraph A2.4. Step 3.a.  For HERO UNSAFE ordnance, the SSD in feet is based on multiple TFEs is:  Step 3.b.  For HERO SUSCEPTIBLE ordnance, the SSD in feet and based on multiple TFEs is:   Step 4.  Compare all of the determined SSDs (Table A2.9) and apply the largest value to the situation because the other antennas (antennas 3, 4, and 5) are not operating at the same frequency as antennas 1 and 2. Table A2.9.  Scenario 4.  Final SSDs. Note:  For this scenario, the SSD value of 374 feet would apply if all ordnance items were certified as HERO UNSAFE.  The SSD value of 94 feet would apply if all ordnance items were certified as HERO SUSCEPTIBLE.  If the site has mixed certifications, the worst SSD value  42 AFI91-208  1 FEBRUARY 2017 applies and in this case a SSD of 374 feet.  If all ordnance items were certified HERO SAFE, the SSD would be 10 feet. A2.6.4.  Scenario  4.    Consider  a  monopole  antenna  with  a  frequency  of  450  MHz,  EMR emitter  power  of  2  W,  and  antenna  gain  of  2  dBi.    The  EMR  emitter  is  considered  a continuous system and the EMR emitter power is the average power. Step 1.  For HERO SAFE ordnance, guidance provided in paragraph A2.3.2 indicates a SSD of 10 feet unless the EIRP and frequency meets Table A2.5 criteria:  Step 2.  According to Table A2.5, if the EIRP is less than 5 watts for all frequencies, the minimum SSD is 5 feet.  Therefore for this scenario the SSD is 5 feet. Step 3.a.  For HERO UNSAFE ordnance, use Table A2.3 to determine the SSD.  Because the EMR emitter frequency is greater than 80 MHz, the SSD is: Step 3.b.  For HERO SUSCEPTIBLE ordnance, use Table A2.4 to determine the SSD.  Because the EMR emitter frequency is greater than 80 MHz, the SSD is:  Step 3.c.  Because the EIRP does not meet the criteria of Table A2.5 and the calculated SSD is less than 10 feet, the resulting SSD is 10 feet.  A2.6.5.  Scenario  5.    Consider  a  parabolic  antenna  with  a  frequency  of  1,030  MHz,  peak power of 500 W, pw of 0.008 ms, prf of 375 Hz, and antenna gain of 10 dBi. Step 1.  For HERO SAFE ordnance, guidance provided in paragraph A2.3.2 indicates a SSD of 10 feet. Step 2.a.  Because the system is pulse-modulated and the pw is less than 1 millisecond the average power is determined.  First determine the DC: Step 2.b.  Second, determine the average power:   Step 2.c.  Third, determine the EIRP: Step 3.a.  For HERO UNSAFE ordnance, use Table A2.3 to determine the SSD.  Because the EMR emitter frequency is greater than 80 MHz, the SSD is determined using:  Step 3.b.  For HERO SUSCEPTIBLE ordnance, use Table A2.4 to determine the SSD.  Because the EMR emitter frequency is greater than 80 MHz, the SSD is determined using:   AFI91-208  1 FEBRUARY 2017 43 Step 3.c.  Because the EIRP does not meet the criteria of Table A2.5 and the calculated SSD is less than 10 feet, the resulting SSD is 10 feet.  44 AFI91-208  1 FEBRUARY 2017 Attachment 3 EMR ANALYSIS ASSISTANCE A3.1.  Assistance Requests. A3.1.1.  When a HERO situation is suspected or the minimum SSD for a particular location is  in  question,  request  assistance  from  MAJCOM/SEW.    When  classification  of  an  EMR emitter as a TFE, ME, or a MME is unclear, request assistance from AFSEC/SEW. A3.1.2.  MAJCOM/SEW may request assistance from AFSEC/SEW A3.1.3.  Assistance  requests  require  all  of  the  information  needed  for  a  complete understanding of the situation.  Minimum requirements are as follows: A3.1.3.1.  Type  of  platform  (aircraft,  ground  vehicle,  etc.),  ordnance,  and  applicable EIDs involved (HERO certification). A3.1.3.2.  Installation  layout  of  the  area  showing  transportation  routes  of  EIDs  and ordnance  subsystems,  locations  of  ordnance,  and  EIDs  maintenance,  storage,  and assembly/disassembly  areas,  and  locations  of  all  EMR  emitters  and  characteristics  as listed in the HERO survey package. A3.1.4.  Decisions  are  sent  to  the  originating  installation  or  command,  with  information copies sent to all agencies involved in the decision process. A3.2.  EMR Tools.  The WSM shall use the AFSEC SSD calculator for all HERO certified and uncertified ordnance under their cognizance.  The calculator determines SSDs based on the TFE/ME characteristics, records the TFE/ME characteristics, and generates EMR emitter lists.  The calculator is available at the HERO website, https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/afsec/HERO/default.aspx.  AFI91-208  1 FEBRUARY 2017 45 Attachment 4 HERO SURVEY PACKAGE A4.1.  Requirement.  The  WSM  shall  prepare  and  maintain  a  HERO  survey  package  and perform an annual review of its contents.  (T-1). A4.2.  Purpose. A4.2.1.  To  prescribe  through  advanced  planning  the  easiest  and  most  efficient  method  of managing  the  conflict  between  the  EME  created  by  EMR  emitter  equipment  and  HERO certified ordnance. A4.2.2.  The  purpose  of  listing  and  identifying  the  location  of  the  ordnance  present  is  to determine  their  HERO  certification  and  make  note  of  EMR  concerns  at  their  respective locations.    Ordnance  locations  include  all  locations  represented  in  the  S4  for  a  specific ordnance  item;  e.g.,  storage  areas,  assembly  areas,  transportation  routes,  staging  areas,  and deployment  locations.    AFSEC/SEW  provides  HERO  certifications  and  list  them  on  the HERO website, https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/afsec/HERO/default.aspx.  Ordnance not having a  HERO  certification  is  treated  as  HERO  UNSAFE  until  a  HERO  status  is  provided  by AFSEC/SEW.    This  ordnance  may  include  components  or  subsystems  or  all-up  rounds  or HERO  untested  ordnance.    In  all  instances,  observe  the  protective  requirements  outlined  in paragraph 4.2 of this instruction. A4.2.3.  The purpose of the HERO survey package is to document all the EMR emitters on an  installation,  document  ordnance  HERO  certification,  calculate  the  appropriate  SSD  for each  EMR  emitter,  and  determine  which,  if  any,  EMR  emitters  pose  a  HERO  risk  to operations involving ordnance. A4.2.4.  The  purpose  of  completing  an  EMR  emitter  list  is  to  gather  all  installation  EMR emitter information, a HERO survey.  The EMR emitter list for TFEs/MEs is created using the AFSEC SSD calculator.  Specific emitter characteristics are necessary for calculating the SSD for each TFE/ME.  SSDs for approved MMEs are provided by AFSEC/SEW and must be documented on a separate listing.  Each entry is identified by military nomenclature or if appropriate  manufacturer  and  model,  location,  and  calculated  SSDs.    The  EMR  emitter  list must be available ninety days prior to the intent-to-install of any EMR emitter. A4.2.5.  The  purpose  of  completing  an  ordnance  list  is  to  identify  ordnance  used  during operations on the installation, document their HERO certification, and ensure identified EMR emitters to not pose a hazard. A4.3.  Contents. A4.3.1.  The HERO survey package shall consists of the EMR emitter list  consisting of the EMR  emitter  list  for  TFEs/MEs  generated  by  the  AFSEC  SSD  calculator,  the  MME  list consisting  of  all  AFSEC/SEW  approved  MMEs  used  closer  than  10  feet  during  operations involving  ordnance  at  the  installation,  and  ordnance  list  identifying  the  ordnance  at  the installation and their HERO certification. A4.3.2.  The D-8 map showing potential EMR zones that could affect munitions operations.  Plot  only  those  zones  that  actually  impact  munitions  operations  to  include  primary  and alternate  explosive  routes.    The  review  must  be  documented  and  maintained  by  the  WSM.  46 AFI91-208  1 FEBRUARY 2017 Munition  operations  include  storage,  handling,  maintaining,  loading/unloading,  explosive ordnance  disposal  (EOD),  and  assembly  areas  of  explosives,  delivery  routes,  and  weapons loading operations. A4.3.3.  An  assessment  must  be  completed  by  the  WSM  in  writing  for  existing  and  new EMR emitter hazards to operations.  If required, the assessment shall be included as part of the  site  plan  submittal  and  for  new  EMR  emitters,  an  assessment  will  be  added  to  the  site plan. A4.3.4.  The RADHAZ survey results, if applicable. A4.3.5.  Provide the HERO survey package to installation users, EOD, Munitions Supervision/Control, fire department, and any other organization deemed necessary. A4.4.  Collecting Data. A4.4.1.  For  each  TFE/ME  document if  appropriate manufacturer  and  model,  location,  signal  type  (continuous  or  pulse-modulated),  frequency type (single or band), EMR emitter power (average power for continuous and peak power for pulse-modulated), and antenna gain, in addition pw and prf for pulse-modulated systems. the  military  nomenclature  or A4.4.2.  The  pw  and  prf  are  calculated  from  radar  modes  producing  the  highest  average power.    EMR  emitter  power  is  peak  power  for  pulse-modulated  system  with  pw  one millisecond or greater or average power for pulse-modulated system with pw less than one-millisecond. A4.4.3.  For  each  MME,  document  the  manufacturer,  model,  and  SSDs  provided  by AFSEC/SEW. A4.4.4.  Determine HERO certification for all ordnance containing EIDs. A4.4.5.  EMR emitters providing fire alarm systems, giant voice systems, and remote pump control/metering do not require individual identification but shall be evaluated for HERO to installation operations. A4.5.  ISM.  Communication Squadron and/or ISM must inform the WSM and/or the installation safety office of an EMR equipment increase ninety days prior  to the change.  This information consists of data required to calculate SSDs IAW this instruction, determine ordnance operational impact, and update existing HERO survey package and EME.  The WSM and/or the installation safety office updates the EMR emitter list. A4.6.  Munition  Accountable  Systems  Officer  (MASO).  WSM  consults  with  the  MASO  to determine  the  type  and  locations  of  ordnance  items  and  ensures  Operational  Security  and security certification requirements are enforced.  Identify ordnance location on the installation D-8  map,  as  well  as  the  ordnance  transportation  routes.    This  information  is  useful  when performing RADHAZ surveys. A4.7.  RADHAZ Survey. A4.7.1.  Include the latest RADHAZ survey in the HERO survey package, if applicable. A4.7.2.  The  installation  Commander  will  request  a  RADHAZ  survey  when  the  installation safety officer cannot take into account all sources of EMR, needs to evaluate the attenuation AFI91-208  1 FEBRUARY 2017 47 of  the  surrounding  environment,  and/or  cannot  comply  with  minimum  calculated  SSDs because of the lack of real estate or other limitations. A4.7.3.  The RADHAZ survey consists of performing EME measurements and documenting the results with relevant technical data.  Conclusions and recommendation regarding the use of  EMR  emitters  during  ordnance  operations  are  included  and  presented  with  supporting documentation.    The  organization  performing  the  RADHAZ  survey  prepares  a  report  and provides their assessment to the WSM. A4.7.4.  A  RADHAZ  survey  provides  measurements  of  EMR  fields,  as  well  as  a  more detailed  look  at  the  operational  environment.    In  some  instances,  data  gathered  by  the RADHAZ survey alleviates some restrictions imposed by this instruction. A4.7.5.  The  RADHAZ  survey  may  be  performed  by  MAJCOMs,  the  85th  Engineering Installation  Squadron  (EIS),  or  the  Naval  Surface  Warfare  Center,  Dahlgren  Division,  E3 Assessment and Evaluation Branch (B52), (540) 653-2931.  The 85th EIS, Keesler Air Force Base,  is  the  Air  Force  provider  of  electromagnetic  compatibility,  electromagnetic interference, EMR and electromagnetic pulse field measurements, and analytical capabilities.  For  technical  information,  contact  85  EIS/SCYM,  (228)  377-3920/3926,  DSN  597-3920  or email 85EIS.SCYM.1@us.af.mil. A4.7.6.  Ensure the RADHAZ survey consists of applicable ordnance certifications/locations and  EMR  emitters  on  the  installation  to  include  those  that  may  have  security  classification restrictions.    Ensure  that  Operations  Security  (OPSEC)  and  Communications  Security (COMSEC)  requirements  adhere  to  AFI  10-701,  Operations  Security  (OPSEC),  latest revision  and  AFMAN  33-283,  Communication  Security  (COMSEC)  Operations,  latest revision. A4.8.  Preparing Data. A4.8.1.  Calculate the SSD using the AFSEC SSD calculator.  For  MMEs use the approved SSDs provided by AFSEC/SEW.  If a RADHAZ survey has been performed, determine if the measured EMR levels are acceptable at the locations in question. A4.8.2.  Identify all ordnance and their location.  Refer to the HERO website, https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/afsec/HERO/default.aspx, to determine ordnance HERO certification.  The ordnance items are subject to the HERO survey package and their location is compared to the locations of the EMR emitters listed. A4.8.3.  Changes  to  the  EMR  emitters,  and/or  ordnance  can  necessitate  the  update  or modification of an existing HERO survey package.  The deletion of either ordnance or EMR emitters is simply a matter of removing the item from the existing HERO survey package. A4.9.  Analyzing Data. A4.9.1.  Compare  the  calculated  distance  to  the  actual  distance  between  each  EMR  emitter and the various ordnance locations.  This process allows for identification of potential HERO problems.    If  a  RADHAZ  survey  has  been  performed,  determine  if  the  resulting  EME  is acceptable. A4.9.2.  Once  EMR  emitters,  ordnance,  and  their  respective  locations  have  been  identified, use  the  installation  D-8  map  to  determine  the  distances  between  the  EMR  emitters  and  the various ordnance locations.  Identify the TFE/ME systems requiring HERO EMR control for 48 AFI91-208  1 FEBRUARY 2017 each ordnance location if required.  HERO EMR control (radio silence) is necessary.  Impose this  HERO  EMR  control  condition  when  conducting  ordnance  operations,  if  necessary.  Different locations may have identical HERO conditions as a result of this process, i.e., the same  TFE/ME  systems  are  restricted  by  HERO  EMR  control  imposed  in  more  than  one location.  In these instances combine the same HERO EMR control condition by applying to more than one location in order to limit the number of HERO conditions imposed. A4.9.3.  Upon  receipt  of  new  ordnance,  identify  its  location  and  HERO  certification  to determine  if  the  existing  HERO  survey  package  needs  modification.    If  the  ordnance  is percussion  initiated  or  non-explosive,  there  is  no  EMR  control  requirement.    For  ordnance, match its location to the location description and specific conditions and procedures provided in  the  existing  HERO  survey  package.    Similarly,  when  ordnance  items  are  relocated  to  an additional  area,  evaluate  the  ordnance  location  and  add  the  results  to  the  HERO  survey package under the new location. A4.9.4.  The  following  applies  to  new  EMR  emitters  as  well  as  relocated  or  upgraded existing  EMR  emitters.    Add  relocated  or  upgraded  EMR  emitters  to  an  existing  HERO survey  package  when  system  parameters  change,  e.g.,  EMR  emitter  power  or  antenna  gain increase, results in changes to the SSDs.  Assess whether the SSDs encompass the ordnance location outlined in the existing HERO survey package.  Assess the SSDs and identify EMR emitter  location,  then  compare  these  distances  with  the  distances  from  known  ordnance locations  outlined  in  the  existing  HERO  survey  package.    If  the  SSDs  encompass  any  of these ordnance locations, as outlined in the existing HERO survey package incorporate EMR control restrictions (radio silence) into the existing HERO survey package for the appropriate location.  AFI91-208  1 FEBRUARY 2017 49 Attachment 5 ORDNANCE MODIFICATION GUIDANCE A5.1.  Introduction.  Use  the  following  as  guidance  to  determine  when  changes  in  ordnance usually result in a recommendation for a HERO test.  Most changes to firing circuits result in a recommendation to conduct a HERO test. A5.2.  Guidance. A5.2.1.  EID  changes  that  require  HERO  evaluation  consist  of  changing  firing  stimulus response  characteristics,  changing  the  type  of  transducer  that  converts  electrical  input  to energetic  output,  changing  the  fit  or  form  of  the  EID,  changes  to  EMR  suppression components,  and  relocating  EID  to  within  ¼  λ,  approximately  0.667  inches,  of  wiring  that enters or exits ordnance envelope. A5.2.2.  Firing  circuit  changes  that  require  a  HERO  evaluation  consist  of  all  non-direct current  firing  circuits  (always  require  testing),  relocating  firing  circuits  within  ¼  λ, approximately  0.667  inches,  of  wiring  that  carries  signal  or  enters  or  exits  ordnance envelope, changes to EMR suppression components, and most changes to firing circuits. A5.2.3.  Ordnance envelope changes that require a HERO evaluation are any added aperture or  antenna,  changes  to  corrosion  protection  at  mating  seams,  changes  to  wiring  running outside the ordnance envelope, changes to EMR absorber coatings or gaskets, and relocating connects involving ordnance subassemblies that contain EIDs. A5.2.4.  S4  changes  that  require  a  HERO  evaluation  consists  of  changes  in  EMR  levels  in authorized assembly/disassembly spaces for operations that expose EIDs to internal wiring of ordnance subassemblies that contain EIDs and changes in shipping/storage containers where the container is intended to provide protection from EMR.  50 AFI91-208  1 FEBRUARY 2017 Attachment 6 REQUEST FOR HERO CERTIFICATION OR ASSESSMENT A6.1.

A7.1.1.  The  Air  Force  Nuclear  Weapons  Center  (AFNWC)  ensures  military  characteristics (MCs)  and  stockpile-to-target-sequence  (STS)  include  MIL-STD-464  EME  levels.    The Department of Energy (DOE), National Nuclear Security Administration, certifies a nuclear weapon (the articles under their cognizance) and delivers it to DoD.  AFNWC is responsible for  having  the  nuclear  weapon  HERO  certified  by  providing  AFSEC/SEW  the  appropriate HERO evaluation and/or analysis from the design agency. A7.1.2.  AFNWC shall submit  certification requests to  AFSEC/SEW (Attachment 6) for  all current  nuclear  weapons,  including  test  and/or  analysis  regarding  nuclear  weapon  systems compliance with MIL-STD-464 EME by May 2018 or May 2020 if funding is not received until  May  2018  or  after.    For  DOE  ordnance  not  meeting  the  criteria  for  certification  of HERO  SAFE,  AFNWC  shall  take  the  necessary  action  to  resolve  the  issue.    Until  legacy nuclear weapons are HERO certified,  guidance in Attachment 10 applies.  Safety standards outlined  in  this  Attachment  shall  apply  after  nuclear  weapons  have  been  HERO  certified.  After May 2018, uncertified nuclear weapons shall be certified as HERO UNSAFE. A7.2.  MAJCOMs.  MAJCOMs  will  treat  nuclear  weapons  in  maintenance  configurations  and components,  e.g.,  limited  life  components  containing  EIDs,  as  HERO  UNSAFE,  unless specifically  certified  as  HERO  SAFE.    This  includes  removed  shielding  from  EID  sensitive external  connectors.    Conduct  maintenance  operations  under  HERO  UNSAFE  conditions  only when  the  EME  is  restricted  and  does  not  exceed  levels  in  Table  A7.1  and  illustrated  in  Figure A7.1. A7.3.  Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center (AFNWC).  AFNWC will: A7.3.1.  Ensure  IAW  AFMAN  91-118,  Safety  Design  and  Evaluation  Criteria  for  Nuclear Weapon Systems, latest revision, the design of nuclear weapons delivery systems, such as Air Force  and  foreign  aircraft,  cruise  missiles,  Intercontinental  Ballistic  Missiles  (ICBMs), transportation  aircraft,  etc.,  will  minimize  undesired  EMR  emissions  that  could  cause  a nuclear hazard or ordnance ignition. A7.3.2.  Specify  MIL-STD-464  EME  levels  in  nuclear  weapon  MCs  and/or  STS  to  ensure DOE ordnance is HERO SAFE. A7.3.3.  Ensure  design  of  nuclear  weapons  to  be  HERO  SAFE  IAW  MIL-STD-464  HERO aspects during all phases except assembly/disassembly, if appropriate. A7.3.4.  Ensure  when  changes  to  DOE  ordnance  are  proposed  that  requests  for  HERO evaluation  (test,  analysis,  or  a  combination  thereof)  are  IAW  this  instruction  when  the changes  involve  the  EIDs  directly,  any  modification  that  affects  the  EIDs  susceptibility  to EMR, or adds EMR devices to the nuclear weapons (Attachment 5). A7.3.5.  Require  nuclear  weapons  entering  the  Phase  6.X  or  DoD  5000-series  acquisition process  (life  extension  program  or  major  modifications)  undergo  HERO  certification  IAW with this instruction and MIL-STD-464 HERO aspects. 52 AFI91-208  1 FEBRUARY 2017 A7.3.6.  Ensure  DOE  ordnance  variants  or temporary instrumentation  such  as  measurement  hardware,  telemetry,  flight  safety  systems/flight termination  systems,  etc.,  that  contain  EIDs  or  add  EMR  emitters  are  subject  to  this instruction. items,  which test include A7.4.  Certified HERO Nuclear Weapons. A7.4.1.  A  HERO  certified  nuclear  weapon  is  certified  as  HERO  SAFE  in  an  ultimate  user configuration, as an all up round, whereby all EIDs contained by the weapon are immune to adverse  effects  from  the  EME  delineated  in  MIL-STD-464.    Weapon  maintenance configurations  shall  be  deemed  HERO  UNSAFE  unless  specifically  certified  as  HERO SAFE, this includes removed shielding from EID sensitive external connectors.  (T-1). A7.4.2.  Nuclear systems, e.g., ICBMs and cruise missiles, consist of components containing EIDs, e.g., reentry vehicles, fuzes, cruise missile warhead, etc.  HERO certification of these components shall be based on their particular configurations during the nuclear system’s STS phases.  (T-1). A7.4.3.  HERO  certified  nuclear  weapons  are the  HERO  website, https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/afsec/HERO/default.aspx.  Violations of SSD and/or exposure to EMR  levels  higher  than  HERO  SAFE  or  HERO  UNSAFE,  depending  on  configuration,  is cause for rejection of any or all weapons involved in the non-compliance condition.  Rejected weapons  will  be  reported  IAW  Technical  Order  11N-5-1,  Unsatisfactory  Reports,  and AFMAN 91-221, Weapons Safety Investigations and Reports, latest revision. listed  at A7.5.  HERO  Requirements.  The  following  requirements  shall  be implemented  when conducting operations in facilities where nuclear weapons are intended to be stored or undergo maintenance.  Personnel handling nuclear weapons shall: A7.5.1.  Plan operations so that the nuclear weapons have a minimal exposure to EME.  Use the HERO survey package for guidance.  (T-1). A7.5.2.  Not  alter  nuclear  weapons  or  handle  umbilical  cables  and  cable  connectors  unless authorized or approved by technical order or higher authority.  (T-0). A7.5.3.  Not  expose  internal  wiring  and  firing  circuits  by  assembling  or  disassembling  the nuclear weapons or components in EME unless authorized by the nuclear weapon’s technical order or higher authority.  (T-0). A7.5.4.  Not  transport  HERO  UNSAFE  nuclear  weapons.    (T-0).    HERO  UNSAFE components  shall  be  transported  in  sealed,  all-metal  container  whenever  possible  which  is considered  a  HERO  SAFE  configuration.    (T-0).    When  transporting  components  in  a platform, the minimum SSD requirements are applicable.  (T-0). A7.5.5.  Treat nuclear weapons as HERO UNSAFE when they contain disassembled EIDs or when  an  exposed  EIDs,  firing  circuit,  or  wiring  are  present.    (T-0).    Components  shall  be treated as HERO UNSAFE when they contain a disassembled EID or when an exposed EID, firing circuit, or wiring is present.  (T-0). A7.5.6.  Maintain  a  minimum  SSD  of  10  feet  for  HERO  SAFE  nuclear  weapons  and components unless the EMR emitter EIRP and frequency meet the criteria of Table A7.3 then the  minimum  SSD  listed  applies.    (T-1).    If  the  EMR  emitter  is  a  MME,  refer  to  guidance provided in paragraph A7.7.  For nuclear weapons on a delivery platform, where a minimum AFI91-208  1 FEBRUARY 2017 53 of 10 feet is not possible, the platform PM must conduct an analysis and/or test that proves the  MAE  of  the  nuclear  weapons  is  not  exceeded.    (T-1).    When  transporting  nuclear weapons on a trailer or forklift external to a maintenance/storage facility or within an aircraft, the minimum SSD requirements apply.  (T-1). A7.5.7.  Maintain  the  appropriate  SSD  for  HERO  UNSAFE  nuclear  weapons  and components  and  verify  that  the  EME  is  below  HERO  UNSAFE  levels  utilizing  the RADHAZ survey.  If a RADHAZ survey is not up to date or does not take into account all EMR emitters present, determine the appropriate SSDs using Table A7.2.  (T-1).  If the EMR emitter is  a MME, refer  to  guidance provided in  paragraph A7.8.   (T-1).   HERO UNSAFE nuclear  weapons  and  components  are  only  authorized  in  approved  mobile  maintenance platforms, i.e., Weapons Maintenance Truck (WMT) and Secure Transportable Maintenance System (STMS) and facilities maintaining an EME at or below HERO UNSAFE levels.  (T-1).    The  WMT  and  STMS  do  not  provide  sufficient  protection  against  EMR  and  during maintenance  the  appropriate  SSD  for  HERO  UNSAFE  Nuclear  Weapons  must  be maintained. A7.6.  HERO UNSAFE. A7.6.1.  HERO UNSAFE nuclear weapons and components shall not be exposed to electric fields  exceeding  levels  given  in  Table  A7.1  and  illustrated  in  Figure  A7.1.    (T-1).    A RADHAZ  survey  shall  be  performed  IAW  paragraph  A7.9  to  ensure  the  HERO  UNSAFE EME is not exceeded when all sources of EMR cannot be taken into account, the attenuation of the surrounding environment is unknown, and/or minimum SSD cannot be complied with. Table A7.1.  EMAE for HERO UNSAFE Nuclear Weapons.  54 AFI91-208  1 FEBRUARY 2017 Figure A7.1.  HERO UNSAFE Nuclear Weapon EMAE Curve. A7.6.2.  The WSM shall ensure the EME reported by the RADHAZ survey is below HERO UNSAFE  levels.    If  a  RADHAZ  survey  is  not  up  to  date  or  does  not  take  into  account  all EMR  emitters  present,  the  WSM  shall  determine  the  appropriate  SSDs  as  follows:    If  the EMR emitter EIRP and frequency meets the criteria of Table A7.3 the minimum SSD listed applies.  Otherwise calculate the SSDs using equations in Table A7.2.  If the calculated SSD is less than 10 feet, then the resulting SSD is 10 feet. AFI91-208  1 FEBRUARY 2017 55 Table A7.2.  Equations for Computing SSDs for HERO UNSAFE Nuclear Weapons. A7.6.3.  For  TFEs/MEs  that  operate  over  a  frequency  band  and  maintain  similar  EMR emitter power and antenna gain over the frequency band, apply the following guidance: A7.6.3.1.  If  the  EMR  emitter’s  frequency  band  has  a  start  or  lower  frequency  greater than 8 MHz, use the lowest operation frequency to determine the SSD for the frequency band. A7.6.3.2.  If the EMR emitter’s frequency band has an end or upper frequency less than 8 MHz, use the highest operation frequency to determine the SSD for the frequency band. A7.6.3.3.  If the EMR emitter band has a start or lower frequency less than or equal to 8 MHz and an end or upper frequency greater than or equal to 8 MHz, calculate the SSD at 8 MHz because this is the worst case SSD for the frequency band. A7.6.4.  For  continuous  systems  and  pulse-modulated  systems  with  pw  less  than  one-millisecond the EMR emitter power is average power and for pulse-modulated systems with pw one-millisecond or greater the EMR emitter power is peak power. A7.6.5.  For  frequencies  outside  the  range  specified  in  Table  A7.2  request  assistance  from AFSEC/SEW. A7.7.  Minimum SSD Exceptions. A7.7.1.  There are exceptions whereby  EMR emitters are expected to  be,  or are required to be,  closer  than  10  feet  to  HERO  certified  nuclear  weapons.    Their  proximity  to  HERO 56 AFI91-208  1 FEBRUARY 2017 certified  nuclear  weapons  and  low-power  EMR  emitters  require  different  techniques  for mitigating HERO. A7.7.2.  Table A7.3 may be used for TFE/MEs if the EIRP and frequency requirements are met.  AFSEC/SEW uses Table A7.3 when determining the appropriate SSDs for MMEs. Table A7.3.  Minimum SSD Exceptions for HERO Certified Nuclear Weapons. A7.8.  MME Safety Procedures. A7.8.1.  This  instruction  provides  only  guidance  for  using  MMEs  in  proximity  to  nuclear weapons and serves only as part of the safety evaluation required to gain approval for use.  If approved by AFSEC/SEW for use, maintain the determined SSD.  Organizations employing these devices must address other hazards and security concerns. A7.8.2.  If  approved  by  AFSEC/SEW,  MMEs  may  be  authorized  for  use  around  HERO SAFE and HERO UNSAFE nuclear weapons if the required SSD is maintained and as long as  they  are  not  connected  to  power  via  power  cords.    Batteries  shall  not  be  charged  in  the magazines, in storage, build-up, or assembly areas when nuclear weapons are present due to the possibility of the batteries exploding. A7.8.3.  Multiple  MMEs  (two  or  more)  are  not  authorized  in  enclosed,  reflective  spaces  or facilities  where  nuclear  weapons  are  stored  or  undergoing  maintenance;  the  aggregated effects on the ambient or volumetric electromagnetic field in those spaces may increase as a result of complex cavity effects, unless authorized by AFSEC/SEW.  If the RADHAZ survey included the use of two or more AFSEC/SEW approved MMEs while maintain EME levels AFI91-208  1 FEBRUARY 2017 57 that  do  not  exceed  HERO  EME  for  HERO  SAFE  or  HERO  UNSAFE  nuclear  weapons, multiple MMEs are permissible. A7.9.  Other  EMR  Emitter  Safety  Procedures.  Items,  such  as  desktop  computers,  laptops, tablets,  associated  hardware  (such  as  printer,  mice,  etc.),  etc.,  not  configured  with  radiating wireless capability, e.g., cellular, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc., are authorized for use in storage, build-up and assembly areas where nuclear weapons are present with the following restrictions: A7.9.1.  Items  shall  be  certified  to  meet  CFR,  Title  47,  Telecommunication,  Part  15,  Radio Frequency Devices, Class A or B limits and labeled accordingly.  They require no SSD and can  be  used  in  close  proximity  but  cannot  come  in  direct  contact  with  nuclear  weapons, regardless  of  certification.    If  the  item  is  not  properly  labeled  or  cannot  be  determined  to meet  the  appropriate  regulation,  a  SSD  of  10  feet  applies.    If  a  planned  operation  occurs outside the United States where FCC regulations are not applicable, request assistance from AFSEC/SEW. A7.9.2.  Items  with  RF  wireless  capabilities  are  considered  MMEs  and  paragraph  A7.8 applies. A7.10.  HERO Survey Package.  The WSM responsible for nuclear weapons shall prepare and maintain a HERO survey package IAW guidance provided in Attachment 4.  (T-1). A7.11.  RADHAZ Survey. A7.11.1.  RADHAZ  survey  as  defined  in  paragraph  A4.7  shall  be  performed  when  the installation safety officer cannot take into account all sources of EMR, needs to evaluate the attenuation of the surrounding environment, and/or cannot comply with minimum calculated SSDs because of the lack of real estate or other limitations.  (T-1). A7.11.2.  RADHAZ  survey  will  be  performed  at  all  areas,  e.g.,  dock,  transportation  routes, maintenance  facilities,  etc.,  where  HERO  certified  nuclear  weapons  are  employed  during their STS. A7.11.3.  For HERO SAFE nuclear weapons, the EME cannot exceed MIL-STD-464 levels.  For  HERO  UNSAFE  nuclear  weapons,  the  EME  at  the  particular  time  and  place  cannot exceed levels indicated in Table A7.1 and illustrated in Figure A7.1. A7.12.  Test Articles. A7.12.1.  Test articles used in the development/flight testing of nuclear weapons, e.g., Joint Test Assemblies, do not require HERO certification but require HERO assessment.  AFNWC requests  a  HERO  assessment  from  AFSEC/SEW  and  provides  test  data  and/or  analysis  to support the assessment.  AFSEC/SEW will determine compliance with MIL-STD-464 levels and advise AFNWC in writing within thirty days after receipt of the request. A7.12.2.  At a minimum, AFNWC shall provide test data and/or analysis regarding all EIDs having  a safety consequence.    (T-1).    If  AFNWC, design laboratories, and users accept  the risk  that  EIDs  having  a  reliability  consequence  might  dud  or  inadvertently  fire,  test  data and/or analysis for the EIDs that pose only a reliability consequence are not required and the test article shall be assessed for safety only. A7.13.  HERO  Margin.  For  nuclear  weapons,  HERO  margin  is  defined  as  16.5  dB  for  EIDs having  a  safety  consequence  only.    For  ICBM  systems,  when  exposed  to  the  EME  levels 58 AFI91-208  1 FEBRUARY 2017 specified in MIL-STD-464, the maximum rms current in its bridgewire shall be 20 dB below the maximum no-fire current of the EIDs having a safety consequence only. AFI91-208  1 FEBRUARY 2017 59 Attachment 8 HERO WARNING SYMBOLS A8.1.  HERO  Warning  Symbol.  Warning  symbols  shall  be  posted  by  units  operating  any location  where  an  EMR  emitter  creates  the  potential  for  premature  initiation  or  dudding  of ordnance  due  to  HERO.    (T-1).    An  example  of  a  HERO  warning  symbol  is  shown  in  Figure A8.1.    Units  conducting  ordnance  operations,  e.g.,  missile  assembly,  ammunition  storage,  etc., may  place  these  symbols  along  ordnance  transportation  routes  at  prescribed  locations  to  alert emitter operators, such as radios, cellular telephones, etc., to a potential hazard when using these devices past this point. A8.2.  Availability.  HERO  warning  symbols  are  available  from  Defense  Logistics  Agency, (877) 352-2255, http://www.documentservices.dla.mil/, for information on how to requisition. Figure A8.1.  HERO Warning Symbol. 60 AFI91-208  1 FEBRUARY 2017 Attachment 9 MIL-STD-464 REQUIREMENTS A9.1.  Introduction.  MIL-STD-464  HERO  tables  are  included  for  reference  only  and  will  be updated if the parent document changes. A9.2.  Requirements.  EIDs in ordnance shall not be inadvertently actuated during or experience degraded  performance  characteristics  after  exposure  to  the  external  EME  levels  listed  in  MIL-STD-464, Table 9 (Table A9.1), for both direct RF inducted actuation of the EID and inadvertent activation or an electrically powered firing circuit.   (T-1).  Relevant ordnance phases involving unrestricted and restricted levels in MIL-STD-464, Table 10 (Table A9.2). A9.3.  Certification.  In  order  to  receive  a  HERO  SAFE  certification  at  the  all-up  round  or appropriate assembly level, the ordnance or system under test must be evaluated against and be in compliance with MIL-STD-464, Table 9 (Table A9.1).  (T-1).  Compliance shall be verified by test and/or analysis using the methodology in MIL-HDBK-240. AFI91-208  1 FEBRUARY 2017 61 Table A9.1.  Maximum External EME Level for Ordnance. 62 AFI91-208  1 FEBRUARY 2017 Table A9.2.  Ordnance Phases and Associated Environment. A9.4.  Environment.  The unrestricted environment represents the worst case levels to which the ordnance may be exposed.  The restricted environment involves circumstances where personnel are  directly  interacting  with  the  ordnance  (assembly/disassembly,  loading/unloading).    For  the special  case  of  handling  operations,  the  environment  is  intentionally  restricted  to  prevent personnel from being exposed to hazardous levels of EMR energy or contact currents.  However, those operations also tend to increase coupled levels into the ordnance because of actions such as mating  and  de-mating  of  electrical  connectors.    Therefore,  ordnance  must  be  designated  to  be safe under these types of actions at the lower fields associated with the restricted levels. AFI91-208  1 FEBRUARY 2017 63 Attachment 10 HERO PROTECTION OF UNCERTIFIED ORDNANCE A10.1.  Overview. A10.1.1.  This Attachment, formerly chapter 9 in AFMAN 91-201, provides guidance for all HERO uncertified ordnance. A10.1.2.  The  installation  WSM  shall  prepare  and  maintain  the  HERO  survey  package (Attachment 4) for ordnance under their cognizance.  Guidance for determining SSDs in this Attachment applies when HERO uncertified ordnance is involved. A10.2.  TFE/ME  Safety  Procedures  (Conventional  Ordnance).  The  following  outlines  the procedures  for  ensuring  the  EMR  from  a  TFE/ME  does  not  cause  inadvertent  EID  initiation.  This is done by maintaining SSDs between the EMR emitters and the EIDs. A10.2.1.  Collect  and  review  the  following  information  prior  to  performing  any  operation involving HERO uncertified conventional ordnance: A10.2.1.1.  Determine the configuration of the ordnance during the planned operation. A10.2.1.2.  Determine  the  EME  at  the  location  of  the  planned  operations.    This information should be available from the HERO survey package, the ISM, or installation safety office. A10.2.1.3.  Use the RADHAZ survey to determine if the EME at the location of ordnance operations is acceptable, otherwise determine the SSD from each known TFE/ME using Table A10.1.  Conduct the planned operations at locations greater than the SSD for each TFE/ME.  If the calculated SSD is less than 10 feet, the SSD is 10 feet. A10.3.  TFE/ME  Safety  Procedures  (Nuclear  Weapons).  The  following  outlines the procedures  for  ensuring  the  EMR  from  a  TFE/ME  does  not  cause  inadvertent  EID  initiation.  This is done by maintaining SSDs between the EMR emitters and the EIDs. A10.3.1.  Collect  and  review  the  following  information  prior  to  performing  any  operation involving HERO uncertified nuclear weapons: A10.3.1.1.  Determine  the  configuration  of  the  nuclear  weapon  during  the  planned operation. A10.3.1.2.  Determine  the  EME  at  the  location  of  the  planned  operations.    This information should be available from the HERO survey package, the ISM, or installation safety office. A10.3.2.  Use  the  RADHAZ  survey  to  determine  if  the  EME  at  the  location  of  nuclear weapons operations is  acceptable, otherwise determine the SSD from  each known TFE/ME using  Table  A10.2.    Conduct  the  planned  operations  at  locations  greater  than  the  SSD  for each TFE/ME.  If the calculated SSD is less than 10 feet, the SSD is 10 feet. A10.4.  MME Safety Procedures and Considerations.  If any commercial, common-use EMR emitters  fitting  the  category  of  MMEs  are  present  in  the  location  where  EID  operations  are planned apply the following additional guidelines: 64 AFI91-208  1 FEBRUARY 2017 A10.4.1.  Most of the EMR emitters considered MMEs are governed by the FCC and CFR, Title 47,  Telecommunication.  Common commercially obtained sources of RF energy, such as  cellular  telephones,  remote  key  fobs,  etc.,  are  normally  governed  for  emission  levels  by FCC Part 15 or Part 22 and are identified accordingly.  If compliance cannot be ascertained via  markings  on  the  device  or  within  the  owner’s/user’s  manual  or  if  a  planned  operation occurs outside the United States where FCC regulations are not applicable, request assistance from AFSEC/SEW. A10.4.2.  MMEs  are  not  authorized  within  10  feet  of  any  exposed  EID,  or  any  weapons system containing an EID except those specific items that have been individually researched and addressed in writing by AFSEC/SEW.  When a lesser distance is allowed, keep MMEs at least  10  feet  away  whenever  possible.    Using  any  EMR  emitter  device  closer  than  10  feet must only take place if required for the proper use of the EMR emitter device or if required to complete the planned and approved operation and is not justified by issues of convenience or for the sole purpose of ease of operations. A10.4.2.1.  All remote entry devices, including car entry keys, in compliance with Code of  Federal  Regulations  (CFR),  Title  47,  Telecommunication,  Part  15,  Radio  Frequency Devices, paragraph 15.231, Periodic operation in the band 40.66-40.70 MHz and above 70 MHz, are only restricted from coming into physical contact with ordnance, regardless of configuration.  Remote entry devices not in compliance with regulations must maintain a  SSD  of  10  feet.    If  a  planned  operation  occurs  outside  the  United  States  where  FCC regulations are not applicable, request assistance from AFSEC/SEW. A10.4.2.2.  If  the  operator  is  unsure  a  device  should  be  defined  as  an  MME  or  the operator has an MME not  specifically addressed in  this section, request  assistance from AFSEC/SEW.  AFSEC/SEW will analyze and distribute information regarding decisions, approved use guidelines, and SSDs for specified devices on a case-by-case basis. A10.5.  Maximum  Power  Density  Criteria.  When  the  minimum  SSD  cannot  be  achieved because  of  lacking  real  estate  or  any  other  limitation,  a  RADHAZ  survey  must  be  made  at  the location where the operations are planned to occur.  Compare the measured power density with the recommended maximum  power density calculated from  Table A10.1 for HERO uncertified conventional  ordnance  or  Table  A10.2  for  HERO  uncertified  nuclear  weapons.    The  measured power density must be no greater than the maximum power density provided in the appropriate table. AFI91-208  1 FEBRUARY 2017 65 Table A10.1.  Power Densities and SSDs for HERO Uncertified Conventional Ordnance. Notes Table A10.1: 1. For the formulas in this tablef = frequency (MHz) 66 AFI91-208  1 FEBRUARY 2017 Pt = EMR emitter power (W) which is equal to peak power for pulse-modulated systems with pw one-millisecond or greater or average power for pw less than one-millisecond and continuous systems. Gt = numerical (far-field) antenna gain ratio Power density conversion:  10 W/m2 = 1 mW/cm2 2. When more than one EMR emitter is operating in an area, each at a different frequency, themaximum allowable power density is the greatest power density calculated for each of the EMR emitters. 3. For frequencies outside the ranges specified in this table request assistance fromAFSEC/SEW. 4. Maximum allowable power densities for HERO uncertified conventional ordnance do notinclude personnel exposure limit considerations.  While “Exposed EID” values are all below personnel exposure limits as specified in AFI 48-109, Electromagnetic Field Radiation (EMFR) Occupational and Environmental Health Program, latest version, review additional guidance for operations involving EIDs “In Storage or Ground Transport in a Non-Metallic Container,” for EIDs “In Storage or Ground Transport in a Metallic Container,” or for EIDs “In or On an Aerial Delivery Platform.” 5. Configuration Descriptions:“Worst-Case.”  When EIDs are unshielded or the leads or circuitry could inadvertently be formed into a resonant dipole or loop antenna or the configuration of the EIDs is unknown. “Exposed EID.”  When EIDs are exposed due to maintenance, assembly, or disassembly or the item or munition which contains the EID is exposed due to maintenance, assembly or disassembly. “In Storage or Ground Transport in a Non-Metallic Container.”  When EIDs are stored or in a ground transport configuration inside a conductive (metallic) container.  This includes EIDs assembled in a weaponized configuration when the weapon case provides a conductive shield. “In or On an Aerial Delivery Platform.”  When EIDs or the item or munition containing them are in a transport configuration inside cargo aircraft, externally loaded on an aircraft, or on a drone. “Leadless EID.”  When EIDs do not have lead wires and are in original shipping configurations and/or containers. 6. When handling or installing EIDs use “Exposed EID” configuration even though leadlessEIDs are involved because weapon system wiring could form a resonant antenna during installation. 7. When unclear about the appropriate configuration to apply use the most conservative, i.e., thegreatest distance or largest power density. AFI91-208  1 FEBRUARY 2017 67 Table A10.2.
