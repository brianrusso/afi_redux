Introduction.  Linked  throughout  history,  military  operations  have  succeeded  or  failed based  on  the  ability  of  commanders  to  incorporate  environmental  conditions  into  their  tactics.  Just as weather has had effects  on past  operations, the atmosphere also  has the ability to  either enhance or reduce the performance of aircraft and weapon systems.  To effectively accomplish the AF mission, and maintain the advantage in the operational environment, aircrews must have a thorough awareness and understanding of the air or space domains in which they operate.  AF weather  personnel  deliver  accurate,  consistent,  relevant,  and  timely  environmental  information, products, and services as part of the joint team.  The goal is to provide the AF, Army and other Department of Defense (DoD) organizations and their personnel the knowledge needed to exploit the  weather  for  military  operations.    Weather  operations  facilitate  characterization  and exploitation  of  the  air  and  space  environment  through  the  processes  of  collection,  processing, analyzing,  predicting,  tailoring,  and  integrating  weather  information  into  the  commander’s decision  making  cycle,  mitigating  the  effect  weather  may  have  on  military  operations.    Vast amounts of weather data and information are available to you from various unofficial providers via  web  technology,  but  the  timeliness  and  reliability  is  not  guaranteed,  especially  for  sparsely populated overseas locations.  This text will summarize AF and government services, charts, and weather codes from authoritative sources. 1.2.  Strategic  and  Global.  AF strategically-focused units provide worldwide atmospheric and space weather products and support necessary to conduct military operations. 1.2.1.  Headquarters,  United  States  Air  Force.    The  Director  of  Weather  Operations  (HQ USAF/A3W)  functionally  manages  weather  operations,  services  and  support  for  the  AF, Army  and  specified  DoD  organizations.    This  includes  weather  policy,  weather  resources, interagency  and  interservice  coordination  of  meteorological  and  space  environmental matters, integration into strategic and wartime planning scenarios. relevant to  aircrews 1.2.2.  2nd Weather Group (2 WXG).  2 WXG, through its subordinate squadrons, produces global weather products and services to meet the requirements of the AF, Army and specified DoD  missions  including  dedicated  weather  history  (climatology),  current  global  weather analysis,  global  weather  predictions,  and  space  environment  characterization  and  forecasts.  Specific  services imagery, meteorological  guidance,  aviation  automated  flight  planning,  and  computations  for  ballistic missile  systems.  Additionally,  the  Space  Weather  Flight,  and  globally  dispersed  solar observing  locations,  provide  24-hour,  7  days  per  week,  space  environmental  support  for worldwide  operations  as  a  specialized  function.    Space  weather  includes  the  analysis  and predicted  effects  of  solar  storms,  geomagnetic  storms,  and  ionospheric  disturbances.  Products  include  alerts  and  assessments  that  may  impact  operations.    Space  weather  can adversely  affect  high  frequency  communications,  Ultra  High  Frequency  (UHF)  satellite communications, precision navigation and timing, surveillance and weapon systems, as well as high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft, to include radiation dosages. include  meteorological  satellite 1.2.3.  618th  Air  Operations  Center  (AOC).    The  618  AOC,  Tanker  Airlift  Control  Center (TACC),  provides  weather  products,  services,  and  briefings  for  mission  planning  and 8 AFH11-203V2/ARMY TC 3-04.14-2  13 AUGUST 2015 execution phases managed by 618 AOC (TACC) for strategic airlift and air refueling crews operating  worldwide.    These  include  mission  execution  forecasts  for  U.S.  Transportation Command-tasked  missions  and  other  selected  missions  flown  by  Air  Mobility  Command (AMC) and AMC-gained Air Reserve Component (ARC) flying units. 1.2.4.  23rd Special Operations Weather Squadron (23 SOWS).  The 23 SOWS is Air Force Special Operations Command's (AFSOC) reachback weather squadron.  It is responsible for providing  24/7  global  weather  support  and  services  to  specified  Joint,  Army  and  Air  Force Special Operations Forces missions. 1.3.  Regional.  In  order  to  eliminate  duplication  within  space  and  time,  regional  products  are produced and/or further tailored from global information and products. include  regional  and 1.3.1.  Operational  Weather  Squadrons  (OWSs),  or  specified  organizations,  provide centralized operational-level support primarily through, and in coordination with, AF weather personnel assigned or deployed within the respective region or theater.  OWSs are generally aligned to support a geographic Combatant Commander’s Area of Responsibility (AOR), or portion, thereof.  OWS support is oriented toward AF and Army service component missions and landing-zone/range/air refueling/target  forecasts,  flight  weather  briefings,  weather  watches,  warnings,  and advisories,  and  Terminal  Aerodrome  Forecasts  (TAFs)  for  designated  airfields  within  their region.  The OWS provides briefing support to transient aircrews or aircrews not supported by a designated Weather Flight  (WF), or  equivalent.    AF  Visual  Aid  (AFVA)  15-137,  Air Force  Operational  Weather  Squadron  Areas  of  Responsibility,  illustrates  current  OWS AORs.    OWS  phone  numbers  are  in  the  DoD  Flight  Information  Publication  (FLIP) Supplement and Flight Information Handbook (FIH). theater  scale  forecasts,  drop  and 1.3.2.  Geographic AOCs.  Within an AOC, weather personnel supporting geographic AOCs are  typically  administratively  aligned  under  the  combat  operations  division  but  integrate weather  throughout  all  AOC  divisions  and  operations.    The  size  of  the  weather  support element  is  flexible  and  responsive  to  the  changing  requirements  of  the  operation.    For example, at a geographic AOC, weather personnel support other specialty teams, such as the battlefield  coordination  detachment  and  the  joint  personnel  recovery  center.    The  AOC’s weather  element  normally  reaches  back  to  a  supporting  OWS  for  a  significant  portion  of weather information needed to support AOC operations. 1.4.  Local.  Typically  at  the  base  or  tactical  level,  weather  organizations  organize  as  a  WF within  an  Operations  Support  Squadron  (OSS)  to  support  AF  operations  or  as  a  WF  or Detachment  in  a  Weather  Squadron  (WS)  to  support  Army  operations.    The  WFs  and Detachments are the main direct support to the combat or combat support mission.  WFs provide aircrew  and  flight  safety  briefings,  Pilot-to-Metro  Service  (PMSV)  support,  Mission  Weather Products  (e.g.,  Commander  Update  Briefs,  planning  forecasts,  and  Tactical  Decision  Aids [TDAs]), MISSIONWATCH (deliberate process for monitoring weather or space conditions for specific  mission-limiting  factors),  METWATCH  (deliberate  continuous  process  for  monitoring weather  or  space  conditions  in  a  general  area  or  region),  and  surface  weather  observations.  Other  responsibilities  include  providing  resource  protection  products  in  the  form  of  weather watches,  warnings  and  advisories  for  AF,  Army  and  specified  DoD  assets  and  providing mission-tailored weather briefings for each phase of flight.  Briefings are available in-person, via telephone/fax  or,  in  some  circumstances,  other  remote  video  or  teleconferencing  capabilities.  AFH11-203V2/ARMY TC 3-04.14-2  13 AUGUST 2015 9 Most  WFs  are  only  manned  for  weather  briefing  services  during  airfield  hours  at  controlled military airfields.  If weather services are unavailable at your location, contact the regional OWS or an approved source. 1.4.1.  Reserve Component Weather Support.  Reserve component weather personnel consist of those forces within the ANG and AFRC.  These resources primarily support AF and Army wartime  deployment  and  employment  requirements.    AFRC  also  conducts  tropical  storm weather reconnaissance.  Selected ARC resources will support rotational (i.e., Air and Space Expeditionary  Force)  commitments  on  a  volunteer  basis  and  sustainment  missions  as requirements dictate.  To the maximum  extent possible, ARC personnel  will train  with  and support their wartime units.  Most ANG weather personnel are designated as combat support to Army National Guard units. 1.5.  OWS-WF-Aircrew  Interface.  It  is  highly likely that  your main interaction as an  aircrew member is with the local WF and the regional OWS.  Mission support improvement and mission success depends on the continuous interchange between the OWS, WF and the aircrew.  OWSs create  products  and  monitor  weather  for  its  theater  AOR.    OWS  personnel  develop  long-term weather knowledge and sustain a persistent presence of International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)/World  Meteorological  Organization-qualified  aeronautical  meteorological  forecasters that  improve  theater  forecast  quality  and  mission  support.    An  example  of  OWS-WF  interface occurs  during  the  forecast  process.    An  OWS  coordinates  forecast  content  with  the  local  WF before issuing the TAF for their aerodrome.  The WF monitors the TAF and notifies the OWS when  observed  conditions  may  drive  a  TAF  amendment  based  on  operational  or  other established criteria. 1.6.  WF-Aircrew  Interaction.  Interaction  between  WFs  and  aircrews  is  crucial  to  the enhancement of mission support.  WFs work with aircrews to learn aircraft capabilities, tactics, techniques  and  procedures  along  with  mission  profiles  to  ensure  WF  personnel  and  leadership understand  weather  mission  impacts.    WFs  use  this  information  to  create  Mission  Weather Products (MWPs) that enable decision makers to plan and execute weather-optimized courses of action (COAs) at every decision point in the mission planning and execution process.  Ensuring post-mission feedback from aircrews is a critical step in relating encountered weather features to evaluate effectiveness of each MWP.  WFs use this to adjust future products, including the next “go”, and other services resulting in improved mission support. 1.6.1.  Weather  Briefings.    Weather  briefings  are  a  three-phase  process:  planning,  mission execution,  and  post-mission  debrief.    Your  home  installation  WF  is  the  primary  source  for weather  briefings,  however  some  MAJCOMs  have  established  a  centralized  flight  weather briefing facility for  certain  missions.  If the WF is unavailable or the aircrew is  away  from home  base,  use  the  regional  OWS  to  obtain  or  update  your  weather  brief.    OWSs  support transient  aircrews  or  aircrews  without  WF  support.    Aircrews  should  use  other  approved sources only when the primary points of contact  are unavailable to provide support.  Table 1.1  provides  a  prioritized  list  of  authorized  weather  sources  to  obtain  weather  briefings.  Contact  information  for  the  servicing  OWS  and  base  WFs  in  the  region  of  operations  are located in Section C of the FIH.  Aircrews obtain briefings in-person, via telephone, or on-line  depending  on  the  situation.    It  is  imperative  aircrews  obtain  a  mental  picture  of  the airspace.  Ask yourself, “How will weather affect my flight or weapon system performance?”  Understanding  weather’s  operational  impacts  is  essential  to  mission  success,  especially  if emergency actions become necessary.  Spend the time needed to gather data, especially when 10 AFH11-203V2/ARMY TC 3-04.14-2  13 AUGUST 2015 adverse weather is a factor.  Forming this mental picture of the weather situation is often vital to a successful mission.  Never hesitate to consult weather personnel about any item that you believe needs clarification.

Regional OWS (Note:  Contact information for the servicing OWS and/or installation weather flight is located in Section C of the FIH) 3.  Other DoD weather sources (i.e., U.S. Navy/U.S. Marine Corps) 4.  Other published MAJCOM-approved weather sources 5.  Other U.S. Government (USG) weather facilities/services (i.e., NWS, FAA) 6.  Foreign Government Weather Service (Use only when DoD military resources or USG services are unavailable outside U.S. territory) 1.6.1.1.  Web-based  Aircrew  Briefings.    Web-based  programs  and  portals  provide  a means to facilitate the aviator’s understanding of weather affecting their mission, not to replace  the  input  or  weather  personnel.    Aircrews  using  these  tools  should  contact weather  personnel  to  obtain  additional  information,  clarify  the  products,  or  to  ask questions.  These web-based tools provide the standard weather data, graphics, satellite, and  RADAR  information.    This  includes  airfield  observations,  forecasts,  winds,  and applicable  weather  hazards,  pilot  reports,  and  current  weather  warnings.    WFs  include information  on  how  to  access  and  use  web-based  tools  in  the  Instrument  Refresher Course and can provide additional training upon request. 1.6.1.2.  DD Form 175-1, Flight Weather Briefing.  The DD Form 175-1 is the standard briefing  form.    WFs  and  OWSs  may  use  this  form,  or  a  MAJCOM  or  another  locally-derived alternative; but, whether you receive a verbal or written briefing, it should cover much  of  the  data  contained  on  this  form.    Some  blocks  may  not  be  completed  or  extra information  may  be  added.    Alternatively,  many  bases  produce  a  mission  execution forecast  or  weather  flimsy  that  serves  as  a  weather  briefing  used  by  multiple  flights during local flying missions.  In some cases, this may substitute for an individual weather brief  for  your  flight.    See  Attachment  2  for  an  example  of  the  DD  Form  175-1  and explanation of the form data. 1.6.1.3.  Requesting  Weather  Briefings.    A  unit  flight  scheduler  will  usually  notify  the WF of all planned flights.  If your flight is not scheduled with the WF, provide upcoming flight  notification by website, phone, or other locally  established procedures.  Transient aviators  or  aircrews  without  WF  support  should  request  OWS  support  on-line  or  by phone if web access is not available.  OWSs need a minimum of 2-hours notification to prepare  a  weather  briefing,  however  real-world  short-notice  requirements  (e.g., Aeromedical  Evacuation)  will  still  be  fulfilled  but  may  cause  delays  for  other  aircrews.  You should never leave  your home base without knowing whom to  contact  for weather support and updates.  Military weather briefing facilities and phone numbers are listed in the FLIP and are available at the WF.  When requesting a briefing be prepared to provide as much information as possible.  At a minimum include: AFH11-203V2/ARMY TC 3-04.14-2  13 AUGUST 2015 11 Table 1.2.  Minimum Information Required for Weather Briefing. Your name (Always identify yourself as a crew member) Aircraft type/call sign En route plan (stops, low levels, landing zones, targets, ranges, etc) Proposed altitude Estimated time of departure/return Destination Estimated time of arrival at destination Alternates as required Contact Information (e-mail, fax, etc., for delivering briefing) 1.6.2.  Mission Weather Products (MWP).  MWPs fuse theater and small-scale products with operations,  enabling  the  direct  inject  of  weather  impacts  into  planning  and/or  execution.  MWPs  are  living  documents  and  any/all  feedback  will  be  applied  to  internal  processes  to enhance training, weather personnel proficiency, and product accuracy.  MWPs include flight weather briefings, Intelligence Preparation of the Operational Environment (IPOE) products, mission  planning  briefs,  environmental  inputs  to  mission  analysis,  environmental  staff estimates, and any other weather product prepared to meet the needs of a supported unit. 1.6.3.  Post-Mission  Debrief.    After  pre-mission  interface  with  the  WF,  the  post-mission debrief is the next best way an aircrew can influence and improve weather support.  Aircrew-provided  feedback  of  actual  weather  encountered  helps  the  WF  evaluate  the  mission execution  forecast  process  and  improve  support  and  product  accuracy.    Furthermore,  since airborne crews see a broader horizon and experience phenomena which may not be apparent from the ground-based sensing systems or observers, feedback is extremely important to the next  “go”.  Debriefings  can  be  made  in  person  (ideally),  via  telephone,  locally  established procedures, or other available means. 1.6.4.  Pilot-to-Metro Service Voice (PMSV).  The PMSV is the UHF/VHF radio contact or phone  patch  used  to  obtain  updates  on  current  and/or  forecast  weather  conditions  and  as  a means  for  aircrews  to  provide  weather  inputs  encountered  en  route.    The  FIH  has  PMSV facility locations, frequencies, and instructions.  WFs will immediately respond to all PMSV contacts.    Only  qualified  personnel  will  respond  to  PMSV  calls,  although  trainees  may respond with proper supervision.  Weather personnel will not vector aircraft. 1.7.  Civil  Aviation  Weather  Services.  Providing  weather  services  to  aviation  within  U.S. territory  is  a  shared  effort  between  the  National  Weather  Service  (NWS),  the  Federal  Aviation Administration  (FAA),  the  DoD,  and  other  aviation-oriented  groups  and  individuals.    The following  paragraphs  discuss  the  civilian  weather  agencies  of  the  U.S.  Government  and  their services to the aviation community.  When aircrews are unable to contact their supporting WF or OWS,  they  may  use  NWS,  FAA,  or  other  DoD  services  or  published  MAJCOM-approved sources according to AF Instruction (AFI) 11202, Volume 3, General Flight Rules, and AFMAN 11-217,  Volume  1,  Instrument  Flight  Procedures.    Pilots  should  be  aware  that  unlike  military weather  forecasts,  these  products  are  not  tailored  to  specific  military  aircraft  or  missions; therefore, e.g., turbulence and icing hazard conditions will be more generalized. 1.7.1.  Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers (VAAC).  The NWS operates two of the nine global VAACs:    One  in  Anchorage,  Alaska,  and  the  other  in  Washington,  DC,  at  the  National 12 AFH11-203V2/ARMY TC 3-04.14-2  13 AUGUST 2015 Centers  for  Environmental  Prediction.    The  VAACs  provide  specialized  volcanic  ash advisory products,  both  text  and graphic, and coordinate with  surrounding  VAACs  in  Asia, Europe,  and  the  Southern  Hemisphere  on  long-lived  volcanic  ash  plumes.    These  forecasts are authoritative and may not be altered by military personnel. 1.7.2.  National Hurricane Center (NHC).  As one of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), the NHC (and Joint Typhoon Warning Center east of the dateline in the Pacific Ocean) produce authoritative forecasts for hurricanes and tropical cyclones so USAF forecasters may not deviate from those official products. 1.7.3.  Center  Weather  Service  Unit  (CWSU).    CWSUs  are  units  of  NWS  meteorologists under contract  with  the FAA that are stationed at  and support the FAA’s Air Route Traffic Control  Centers  (ARTCCs).    CWSUs  provide  timely  weather  consultation,  forecasts,  and advice to managers within ARTCCs and to other supported FAA facilities.  This information is based on monitoring, analysis, and interpretation of real-time weather data at the ARTCC through  the  use  of  all  available  data  sources  including  RADAR,  satellite,  Pilot  Weather Reports (PIREPs), and various NWS products such as TAFs and inflight advisories.  Special emphasis is given to those weather conditions hazardous to aviation or which would impede the  flow  of  air  traffic  within  the  National  Aerospace  System  (NAS).    Rerouting  of  aircraft around  hazardous  weather  is  based  largely  on  forecasts  provided  by  the  CWSU meteorologist.    They  issue  the  following  products  in  support  of  their  respective  ARTCC:  Center Weather Advisories and Meteorological Impact Statements. 1.7.4.  Weather  Forecast  Offices  (WFOs).    NWS  WFOs  provide  warnings  and  forecasts throughout the U.S. and it’s territories, including Puerto Rico and Guam.  These 122 offices are responsible for providing TAFs to over 630 airports. 1.7.5.  Flight  Service  Station  (FSS)/Automated  Flight  Service  Station  (AFSS).    FSSs  and AFSSs  provide  pilot  weather  briefings,  en  route  weather,  receive  and  process  Instrument Flight  Rules  (IFR)  and  Visual  Flight  Rules  (VFR)  flight  plans,  relay  air  traffic  control clearances,  and  issue  Notices  to  Airmen.    They  also  provide  assistance  to  lost  aircraft  and aircraft in emergency situations, and conduct VFR search-and-rescue services.  Aircrews can access the FSS/AFSS services listed below via radio or phone as printed in the FLIPs. Information 1.7.5.1.  Hazardous In-flight Weather Advisory Service (HIWAS).  HIWAS is a national program  continuously  broadcasting  (24  hours  per  day)  hazardous  weather  information over selected navigational aids  (NAVAIDs).  The broadcasts include  advisories such as Airman’s  Meteorological (AIRMETs),  Significant  Meteorological Information  (SIGMETs),  convective  SIGMETs,  and  urgent  PIREPs.    These  broadcasts are  only  a  summary  of  the  information,  and  pilots  should  contact  an  FSS/AFSS  or  En Route Flight Advisory Service (EFAS) for detailed information.  The HIWAS broadcast area is defined as the area within 150 NM of the HIWAS outlets.  HIWAS broadcasts are not  interrupted  or  delayed  except  for  emergency  situations,  when  an  aircraft  requires immediate  attention,  or  for  reasonable  use  of  the  voice  override  capability  on  specific HIWAS  outlets  in  order  to  use  the  limited  Remote  Communications  Outlet  (RCO)  to maintain en route communications.  An announcement is made for no hazardous weather.  When a HIWAS broadcasts an update, a one-time HIWAS update announcement is made on all communications/NAVAID frequencies except emergency, EFAS, and navigational frequencies  already  dedicated  to  continuous  broadcast  services.    In  the  event  a  HIWAS AFH11-203V2/ARMY TC 3-04.14-2  13 AUGUST 2015 13 area is  out  of service, broadcast all communications/NAVAID  frequencies  except  on  emergency,  EFAS,  and  navigational frequencies already dedicated to continuous broadcast services. is  made  on announcement an 1.7.5.2.  En  Route  Flight  Advisory  Service  (EFAS).    The  purpose  of  EFAS,  radio  call “FLIGHT  WATCH”  (FW),  is  to  provide  en  route  aircraft  with  timely  and  pertinent weather  data  tailored  to  a  specific  altitude  and  route  using  the  most  current  available sources  of  aviation  meteorological  information.    When  conditions  dictate,  EFAS specialists  provide  information  on  weather  for  alternate  routes  and/or  altitudes  to  assist the pilot in the avoidance of hazardous flight conditions.  The pilot is advised to contact the  adjacent  flight  watch  facility  when  adverse  weather  conditions  along  the  intended route extend beyond the Flight Watch Area (FWA).  EFAS is provided on 122.0 MHz to aircraft below FL180. An assigned distinct frequency is used to provide EFAS to aircraft at FL180 and above.  This frequency can also be used for communications with aircraft below FL180 when communication coverage permits. 1.7.5.3.  Telephone Information Briefing Service (TIBS).  TIBS is a service prepared and disseminated  by  selected  Automated  Flight  Service  Stations.    It  provides  continuous telephone recordings of meteorological and aeronautical information.  Specifically, TIBS provides  area  and  route  briefings,  as  well  as  airspace  procedures  and  special announcements, if applicable.  It is designed to be a preliminary briefing tool and is not intended to replace a standard briefing from a flight service specialist.  The TIBS service is available 24 hours a day and is updated when conditions change.  The phone numbers for the TIBS service are listed in the Airport/Facility Directory. 14 AFH11-203V2/ARMY TC 3-04.14-2  13 AUGUST 2015 Chapter 2 WEATHER PRODUCTS Section 2A—GRAPHIC CHARTS 2.1.  Overview.  Graphical  analysis  and  forecast  products  provide  the  most  efficient  means  of relaying complex weather information to a wide audience.  To improve effectiveness, optimized graphical  forecasts  provided  by  an  OWS  facilitate  military  decisions  and  depict  features  or thresholds  unique  to  military  operations.    For  these  reasons,  AFI  15-128,  Air  Force  Weather  – Roles and Responsibilities, states that OWSs provide the authoritative source for environmental characterizations  for  their  assigned  geographic  regions.    Although  internet-enabled  graphical forecast charts are available from a variety of government or civilian sources, the differences in specification,  amendment  and  depiction  standards  vary  greatly  from  AF  standardized  products.  As outlined in Table 1.1., do not use civilian (government or commercial) products for military decisions  under  routine  circumstances.    The  preferred  source  for  obtaining  graphical  forecast products  on either NIPRNET or higher security  enclaves is  through the  primary  weather portal service,  AF  Weather  Web  Service  (AFW-WEBS),  or  OWS  homepages  until  AFW-WEBS integrates those websites.  (AFW-WEBS offers users dynamic content generation with multiple overlay  and  mapping  presentations  whereas  OWS  websites  generally  specialize  in  presenting static imagery with a limited degree of overlay capability.)  NOTE:  Development is underway to provide access via mobile applications, such as those referred to as the “electronic flight bag”. 2.2.  Accessing  Air  Force  Graphic  Products.  Users may access AF weather graphics through AFW-WEBS,  at  https://weather.af.mil  for  NIPRNET  or  https://weather.af.smil.mil  for SIPRNET.  OWS websites may be accessed from the AFW-WEBS main page or from the list in Table  2.1.  AFW-WEBS  does  require  users  to  register  for  an  account  and  is  Common  Access Card-enabled. Table 2.1.  OWS Website Addresses. 15 OWS, Scott AFB – Northeastern NORTHCOM:   https://15ows.us.af.mil  17 OWS, Hickam AFB – PACOM and Alaskan NORTHCOM:  https://17ows.us.af.mil 21 OWS, Kapaun – EUCOM and AFRICOM:  https://21ows.us.af.mil 25 OWS, Davis-Monthan AFB – Western NORTHCOM or SOUTHCOM:  https://25ows.us.af.mil 26 OWS, Barksdale AFB – Southern NORTHCOM:  https://26ows.us.af.mil 28 OWS, Shaw AFB – CENTCOM:  https://28ows.us.af.mil 2.3.  Standard  Weather  Symbols  .    Weather  phenomena  presented  on  graphical  analysis  and forecast  products  are  displayed  on  C2  systems  in  a  standardized  depiction  and  color  coding scheme to ensure common understanding by DoD and coalition partners.  The latest version of MIL-STD-2525,  Joint  Military  Symbology,  defines  commonly  used  representations.    Figures 2.1,  2.2, and   2.3 illustrate the most common MIL-STD depictions for planning and executing aviation operations.  Products depicting these features are available as static imagery or dynamic (e.g.,  common  operating  picture  overlay)  content.    Meteorological  depictions  from  non-DoD sources may not employ the same symbology or the symbols could have different meaning.  Use caution  when  viewing  these  sources,  especially  if  the  products  do  not  have  a  legend,  e.g., AFH11-203V2/ARMY TC 3-04.14-2  13 AUGUST 2015 15 date/time  group  (DTG).    Graphical  products  may  also  be  available  as  high-resolution  products with non-MILSTD depictions.  These products will employ color filled regions and a legend to facilitate ease of use.

Frontal boundaries are indicated on charts according to Figure 2.3.  The semi-circles and triangles on the frontal line are known as “pips.”  “Pips” indicate front type and point the heading of the front.  Pips on both sides identify a stationary front and suggest little or no movement.  Figure 2.3.  Symbols for Meteorologically Significant Features. Note:  Max wind lines, trough axes, and ridge axes are optional on standard weather charts.  AFH11-203V2/ARMY TC 3-04.14-2  13 AUGUST 2015 19 2.3.2.  Winds.  Wind plots use the “Shaft-Barb-Pennant” method (Figure 2.4).  The “shaft” or  a  line  represents  the  direction  from  which  the  wind  is  blowing.    The  barb  or  pennant represents  the  wind  speed.    A  short  barb  represents  5  knots  and  a  long  barb  represents  10 knots.    Pennants  are  50-knot  winds.    Plotted  wind  directions  are  to  the  nearest  10  degrees relative to true north. Figure 2.4.  Sample Wind Plots.  2.3.3.  Station Symbols.  Station Symbols provide a detailed graphic representation of present weather  at  individual  stations  to  include  cloud  type,  sky  coverage,  sea-level  pressure  in millibars  (mb),  3-hour  barometric  change,  pressure,  present  weather,  past  6-hour  weather, temperature, dew point, visibility (SM), wind speed (knots) and direction.  Weather stations commonly filter the various elements on the station model to make the symbol less cluttered and easier to read.  This capability also provides elements that are relevant to the user.  Note:  Station plots, such as those in Figure 2.5, indicate only the height of the lowest cloud base, designated by a representative code based on the height reported in feet above ground level (AGL).  An “X” shows sky cover without a height entry.  A solidus (/) is encoded for a total surfaced-based obscuration. Figure 2.5.  Complete Station Model. 2.3.4.  Weather  Symbols.    Weather  Symbols  provide  a  detailed  graphic  representation  of weather types (Figure 2.6).  20 AFH11-203V2/ARMY TC 3-04.14-2  13 AUGUST 2015 Figure 2.6.  Basic Weather Symbols. 2.3.5.

Flight-Level Wind Products.  Extracted from meteorological models, flight-level wind products  are provided  for mission  planning and execution.  These products are available in varying  intervals  from  surface  to  over  100,000  feet  above  mean  sea-level  (MSL).  When viewed  via  AFW-WEBS,  wind  products  can  be  displayed  on  an  aeronautical  chart, meteorological  map,  or  earth  background.    Flight-level  wind  forecasts  are  also  available  as gridded  data  fields  for  use  by  machine-to-machine  applications  generating  computer  flight plans or mission weather packages for strategic airlift. 2.4.1.1.  How to use this product.  Select the wind forecast product for the nearest flight level and mission valid time.  Most mission planning systems use the wind forecast valid for  the  mid-point  of  a  mission  and  a  flight  level  most  representative  of  the  mission profile.  Read the wind speeds using the wind barb breakout in  Figure 2.4.  Overlaying aviation  hazards  with  wind  forecasts  at  various  flight  levels  provides  a  single  look  at potential  mission  impacts  and  assists  aviators  during  mission  planning  and  route optimization. 2.4.1.2.  Strengths.    Recent  advances  in  meteorological  modeling  have  significantly improved  the  accuracy  of  flight-level  wind  forecasts,  especially  for  flight  levels  above 10,000  feet  MSL,  providing  more  accurate  forecast  data  for  route  planning  and  fuel consumption calculations. 2.4.1.3.  Weaknesses.    Flight-level  wind  products  are  based  on  meteorological  forecast models which provide output at constantly spaced data points.  Converting the data points to a constant flight level wind chart requires interpolation between the data points which, in  some  cases  may  introduce  small  errors  in  forecast  winds,  especially  in  layers  with dramatic shifts in wind direction or changes in speed.  Flight-level winds less than 10,000 feet  MSL  may  have  operationally  significant  errors  in  some  cases  due  to  incomplete modeling  of  terrain  and  planetary  boundary  layer  effects;  usually  wind  speed  forecasts stronger than actual conditions.  Machine-to-machine applications extracting flight level wind  forecasts  from  gridded  data  may  employ  simple  “nearest  data  point”  systems  to populate flight plans and provide winds not as representative of the actual route of flight. 22 AFH11-203V2/ARMY TC 3-04.14-2  13 AUGUST 2015 Figure 2.8.  Flight Level Wind Product (FL300 Winds with Aeronautical Chart Background) (AFW-WEBS). 2.4.2.  Turbulence Products 2.4.2.1.  Turbulence Forecasts Products  2.4.2.1.1.  How to use this product.  Turbulence forecasts are graphical depictions of the maximum expected turbulence independent of thunderstorms.  These graphics are generated and issued in 3-hour time steps out to the 30-hour point (EUCOM AOR: 6-hour  time  steps  out  to  60  hours)  and  are  continuously  monitored  and  amended  as required.   Extended forecast  turbulence products use model information  for forecast periods  out  to120  (EUCOM  144)  hours,  divided  into  two  levels;  low  level  (below FL180  MSL)  and  high  level  (FL180-500  MSL).    Plan  mitigating  strategies  for mission routes which intersect a bounded area during the valid period of the forecast.  Note:    Clear  Air  Turbulence  (CAT)  areas  on  the  forecast  product  will  contain information on the base, top, and intensity of turbulence with areas of mountain wave turbulence highlighted and depicted separately. 2.4.2.1.2.  Strengths.    Different  types  of  aircraft  have  different  sensitivities  to turbulence.  Table  2.2  lists  the  turbulence  categories  for  military  fixed-wing  and rotary-wing  aircraft  at  their  typical  mission  profile  and  cruise  altitude  followed  by civilian  aircraft.    Turbulence  forecasts  in  TAFs  and  hazard  charts  are  specified  for Category  II  aircraft.    Table  2.3  is  a  guide  to  convert  turbulence  intensities  for different categories of aircraft.  AFLCMC validates and coordinates the authoritative determination. Table 2.2.

The table therefore should be considered authoritative; however, an aircraft’s weight, airspeed, and/or altitude may change its turbulence category from its default value found in this table.  Original source document is AFWAL-TR-81 3058.  For updates and aircraft additions, contact AFLCMC/XZIG, DSN 785-2299/2310.  Note 2:  If an aircraft is not listed, the following conservative Turbulence Categories can be made: Jets and multi-engine prop/turbo-prop aircraft that fly at/above FL180 can be considered Category II.  All other aircraft should be considered Category I (not related to AIRMETs/SIGMETs).  Note 3:  Turbulence Categories for helicopters is primarily determined from aircrew feedback.  The methodology used for fixed-winged aircraft is not applied to helicopters due to their added complexity.  Note 4:  The CV-22 displays aspects of flight that include rotor-wing operations and therefore objective gust load calculations and turbulence categorization are not possible for rotor phase of flight (e.g. takeoff/landing).   Note 5:  Turbulence categories for aircraft with gust alleviations systems (passive or active) are likely less susceptible to turbulence than their computed category.  AFH11-203V2/ARMY TC 3-04.14-2  13 AUGUST 2015 27 Note 6:  Turbulence categories for Small UAVs (Mean Aerodynamic Chord < 2 ft), cannot be determined using the Gust Loads Formula and therefore should be considered Category I. Table 2.3.  Aircraft Turbulence Intensity Conversion Chart.  2.4.2.1.3.  Weaknesses.    Clear  Air  Turbulence  (CAT)  is  a  transitory  event  resulting from  the  formation  and  collapse  of  unstable  atmospheric  waves  and  vortices  over time.  For this reason, turbulent areas on turbulence forecast products depict regions where  environmental  conditions  are  most  favorable  for  repetitive  generation  and collapse  of  the  atmospheric  waves  and  vortices  responsible  for  the  majority  of turbulence events. 2.4.2.1.3.1.  Turbulence  charts  are  specified  for  Category  II  aircraft  with  a  clean airframe  cruising  in  level  flight  at  the  most  efficient  cruising  airspeed  at  a “typical” weight with a crew that has taken no precautions to mitigate CAT.   The  minimum  resolvable  feature  on  standard  products 2.4.2.1.3.2.  The  MIL-STD  depiction  used  in  these  products  degrades  product resolution. is approximately  60  nautical  miles  (108  kilometers).    Higher  definition  products rendered  as  color  fills  (see  Figure  2.11)  are  displayed  at  significantly  finer resolutions as high as 2 to 7 nautical miles (4-12 km) and may be used to execute missions,  especially  in  the  lower  levels  of  the  atmosphere  where  mechanical  or terrain induced turbulence is more prevalent. 28 AFH11-203V2/ARMY TC 3-04.14-2  13 AUGUST 2015 Figure 2.9.

AIRMET/SIGMET Summaries.  2.4.2.2.1.  How  to  use  this  product.    Use  graphical  presentations  of  AIRMET  or SIGMET  bulletins  in  the  same  fashion  as  other  turbulence  forecasts.    Users  should pay  close  attention  to  the  valid  times  of  the  product  and  apply  them  if  the  intended route of flight intersects with the area designated on the product. 2.4.2.2.2.  Strengths.  AIRMETS and SIGMETS are event-based products and rapidly issued,  amended,  and  cancelled,  making them  a  very  efficient  means  of communicating threats. 2.4.2.2.3.  Weaknesses.  AIRMETS and SIGMETS issued in some parts of the world give no consideration to the type of aircraft reporting turbulence; a single report from a  light  aircraft  operating  in  vicinity  of  mountains  is  sufficient  to  warrant  issuing  a SIGMET  for  a  much  larger  geographic  area  affecting  every  category  of  aircraft intending to operate in the airspace. AFH11-203V2/ARMY TC 3-04.14-2  13 AUGUST 2015 31 Figure 2.12.  AIRMET Summary Overlaid with a RADAR Mosaic (AFW-WEBS). 2.4.3.  Icing Products.  2.4.3.1.  How  to  use  this  product.   Icing forecasts depict maximum  icing conditions  not associated with  thunderstorms.   Forecaster generated products  are issued  in  3-hour time steps out to the 30-hour point and are continuously monitored and amended as required.  Extended  forecast  icing  products  are  produced  for  the  33-120  hour  time  frame  using meteorological  models.    These  forecasts  are  based  on  meteorological  models  and  are updated every six hours. 2.4.3.2.  Strengths.    Air  Force  graphical  icing  forecast  products  are  tailored  for  military decisions  to  ensure  a  high  probability  of  detection  of  atmospheric  conditions  most favorable for icing.  Air Force graphical forecasts are sub-divided into low level (surface to FL180) and upper level (FL180-FL500); graphical forecast from civilian agencies are usually not available below FL150.  All flight level graphics are measured in MSL.  AF weather  personnel  routinely  update  graphical  forecasts  products  and  amend  incorrectly specified  icing  areas  as  required.  In  addition,  the  underlying  digital  data  fields  are updated  for  consumption  by  weather-enabled  C4ISR  systems  via  machine-to-machine transfer. 2.4.3.3.  Weaknesses.  The MIL-STD depiction  used in  these products  degrades product resolution.    The  minimum  resolvable  feature  on  standard  products  is  approximately  60 nautical  miles  (108  kilometers).    Higher  definition  products  rendered  as  color  fills  (see Figure  2.15)  are  displayed  at  significantly  finer  resolutions  of  approximately  2  to  7 nautical  miles  (4-12  km).    Basis  of  icing  intensities  depicted  on  graphical  forecast products  (civilian  or  military)  focus  on  an  idealized  aircraft  cruising  through  the  icing 32 AFH11-203V2/ARMY TC 3-04.14-2  13 AUGUST 2015 area  without  taking  preventative  steps  to  reduce  or  prevent  ice  accumulation  on  the airframe.    Aircraft  climbing  or  descending  through  the  icing  layer  may  experience different  icing  effects  than  an  aircraft  cruising  through  the  same  layer.    Employment  of anti-icing  or  de-icing  equipment  significantly  impacts  the  accumulation  of  icing.    For these reasons, apply context while evaluating icing forecasts when PIREPS of no icing or lower intensity icing occur in forecasted areas. Figure 2.13.

How  to  use  this  product.    Air  Force  standard  thunderstorm  forecast products depict the total area affected and the maximum instantaneous thunderstorm coverage  over  a  3-hour  period  starting  with  the  valid  time.    Thunderstorm  forecast graphics  provide  military  decision  makers  with  the  maximum  storm  tops  and  the broadest coverage within the forecast area for the valid period.  See  Table 2.4 for a breakdown  of  the  coverage  categories.    Areas  specified  with  numerous  coverage (NMRS) are  generally  considered to  be those in  which thunderstorms  are not  easily circumnavigated  while  still  leaving  proper  avoidance  distance  at  altitude.    Mission profiles  intersecting  areas  designated  at  risk  for  thunderstorms  may  need  to  be adjusted  to  avoid  the  thunderstorm  threat  depending  on  the  area  coverage  of  the threat.    Operating  in  thunderstorms  is  generally  restricted  in  all  AF  11-2  Mission Design Series (MDS) instructions and Army Regulation (AR) 95-1, Army Regulation Aviation Flight Regulations and most publications restrict takeoffs and landings when thunderstorm  activity  is  within  5NM  of  an  airfield.    In  addition  to  lightning;  severe turbulence, severe icing, hail, and wind shear are implied when operating in  or near thunderstorms.    These  forecasts,  issued  in  3-hour  blocks  for  both  mission  planning and  execution  within  the  first  30-hour  time  frame,  are  continuously  monitored  and amended for rapidly changing or unforecast conditions.  Products for the 33-120 hour time frame use meteorological model forecasts and are not amended, but reissued as the meteorological models update each 12-hour period. AFH11-203V2/ARMY TC 3-04.14-2  13 AUGUST 2015 35 Table 2.4.  Thunderstorm Forecast Coverage. Isolated (ISOLD)  Few (FEW)  Scattered (SCT)  Numerous (NMRS)    Maximum instantaneous coverage greater than 45%  Maximum instantaneous coverage of 1-2%  Maximum instantaneous coverage of 3-15%  Maximum instantaneous coverage of 16-45% 2.4.4.1.2.  Strengths.  Thunderstorm forecast products are consistently monitored and adjusted  when  conditions  are  not  correctly  specified  in  the  original  forecast.    The graphical forecast is a compilation of the 3 hours for the valid period of the forecast which  enables  weather  personnel  to  depict  thunderstorms  with  short  life  cycles.   Thunderstorm coverage values on the graphical thunderstorm forecast are the same as those used in flight weather briefings and no conversion is necessary.  Thunderstorm coverage  and maximum  tops  are more extensive  than similar products  from  civilian sources which may only depict organized thunderstorm complexes or thunderstorms which intersect international routes or airways. 2.4.4.1.3.  Weaknesses.    The  graphical  thunderstorm  forecast  cannot  be  used  as  a stand-alone  product.    The  forecast  graphic  depicts  a  3-hour  compilation,  or  time phasing, of an entire area affected by thunderstorms during the 3-hour valid period of the  forecast  graphic.    Taken  in  isolation,  the  thunderstorm  graphic  will  generally provide a pessimistic representation of any single time frame within the 3-hour time phased  window.    Figure  2.17  shows  how  an  organized  area  of  rapidly  moving thunderstorms will be depicted on the thunderstorm forecast; at first glance it would seem that the entire area shown within the MIL-STD display is covered with 3-15% thunderstorms,  but  since  the  thunderstorms  are  moving  through  the  area,  it  may  be possible to operate in the western regions of the area late in the valid period or in the eastern portions of the region early on in the valid period of the forecast.  Figure 2.19 depicts  lightning  strike  location  and  timing  data  overlaid  on  a  meteorological  map background. 36 AFH11-203V2/ARMY TC 3-04.14-2  13 AUGUST 2015 Figure 2.17.

SOUTHCOM Area High-Resolution Extended Period Thunderstorm Forecast (Color-fill Method of Depiction).  2.4.4.2.  Weather  RADAR  mosaics.  RADAR  mosaics  are  compilations  from  multiple RADARs  within  a  network  with  slightly  different  sample  times,  so  a  mosaic  date  and  38 AFH11-203V2/ARMY TC 3-04.14-2  13 AUGUST 2015 time stamped for a specific valid time may contain RADAR data from some RADARs in the  network  that  is  slightly  older  (usually  not  more  than  10  minutes).    Imagery  from single site RADARs are more suited for making critical decisions regarding resource or force protection actions. 2.4.4.2.1.  How to use this product.  RADAR mosaics, looped or overlaid with other forecast  products,  improve  situational  awareness  and  assist  in  short-term  decision making.    These  products  depict  the  RADAR  returns  at  any  point  in  the  atmosphere during  the  valid  period  of  the  product  and  are  color  coded  to  quickly  highlight precipitation type or areas with the strongest RADAR returns (Figure 2.21).  Figure 2.22 also shows the RADAR mosaic accompanied by storm reports and current OWS warnings for a Total Force location in CONUS.  More detailed information on ground weather RADAR is found in Section 2E. 2.4.4.2.2.  Strengths.    Produced  and  displayed  in  near  real  time,  this  product  is  an efficient and effective means of relaying weather RADAR information. 2.4.4.2.3.  Weaknesses 2.4.4.2.3.1.  Many  parts  of  the  world  lack  sufficient  RADAR  coverage  to  create mosaics.  In some cases, host nations treat RADAR data as proprietary and delay release  to  the  international  aviation  community  for  several  minutes  after collection.  Paying customers may receive the data in near real time. 2.4.4.2.3.2.  Even in dense RADAR networks, terrain blocking, interference from wind power generators, or other beam propagation effects may cause “dead spots” or  gaps  in  RADAR  coverage.    These  areas  may  appear  as  echo  free  when RADAR detectable features are actually present. AFH11-203V2/ARMY TC 3-04.14-2  13 AUGUST 2015 39 Figure 2.21.

How to use this product.  Use lightning data in concert with other products to gather a complete picture of the threats posed by the natural environment.  When overlaid  with  RADAR  or  satellite  imagery,  lightning  data  can  be  used  to  quickly determine  the  location,  movement,  and  intensity  of  thunderstorms.    Figure  2.23 displays  lightning  strikes  from  the  preceding  60  minutes  and  is  overlaid  on  a meteorological  satellite  image.    Lightning  strikes  are  color-coded  based  on  the  time observed. 2.4.4.3.2.  Strengths.    Lightning  data  can  be  quickly  collected,  geolocated,  and displayed  for  situational  awareness  and  to  facilitate  personnel  protection  and  flight safety decisions. 2.4.4.3.3.  Weaknesses. 2.4.4.3.3.1.  The  most  common  lightning  detection  systems  in  use  today  rely  on ground  stations  to  detect  the  electromagnetic  signatures  of  cloud-to-ground lightning strikes and record the position, strength and polarity of the signal from the  lightning  strike.    The  more  ground  stations  that  detect  the  strike,  the  more accurate the geographic placement of the strike will be. 2.4.4.3.3.2.  Lightning  detection  systems  collect  cloud-to-ground  lightning  with varying  capabilities  for  collecting  cloud-to  air,  in-cloud,  or  cloud-to-cloud lightning posing a direct hazard to airborne aircraft. AFH11-203V2/ARMY TC 3-04.14-2  13 AUGUST 2015 41 Figure 2.23.

These  forecast  products  show  the  lowest  ceiling  or visibility condition during the cardinal hour of the marked forecast valid time.  Mission profiles that intersect a bounded area during the valid period of the forecast can expect to experience cloud ceilings or visibilities less than or equal to the criteria specified in the forecast.    These  point-in-time  forecasts  depict  the  predominant  combined  ceiling  and 42 AFH11-203V2/ARMY TC 3-04.14-2  13 AUGUST 2015 visibility conditions at the cardinal hour of the forecast and are monitored for significant deviation  from  anticipated  conditions.    The  entire  product  suite  is  updated  every  six hours.  Note:  This product set is not produced by the 21 OWS. 2.4.5.2.  Strengths. 2.4.5.2.1.  These forecast products are tailored for military aircraft using the mission planning  criteria  from  AFI  11-202V3  or  AR  95-1.    By  comparison,  similar  looking forecast products from civilian agencies are scaled to accommodate general aviation ceiling and visibility criteria that are not completely compatible with military decision making.  Areas on AF standard products marked with red color fills designate areas with  forecast  ceiling  or  visibility  conditions  prompting  an  aircrew  to  file  for destination alternates on an instrument flight plan. 2.4.5.2.2.  AF  graphical  forecast  products  are  available  at  a  greater  frequency  than similar  looking  products  from  civilian  sources  and  are  continuously  revised  or amended during rapidly changing conditions.  Civilian forecasts, such as those from the Aviation Weather Center  are issued four times a day valid in  6-hour  increments out to 24 hours and are not amended for rapidly changing or unexpected conditions.  Rather  than  amend  graphical  forecasts,  civilian  agencies  issue  AIRMETS  and SIGMETS to supplement the graphical forecasts.  AF weather personnel monitor the graphical forecasts and will amend the products for significant deviations as required; the entire suite is routinely updated on six-hour intervals.  In addition, the underlying digital  data  fields  are  updated  for  consumption  by  weather-enabled  C4ISR  systems via machine-to-machine transfer. 2.4.5.3.  Weaknesses.    Point-in-time  depictions  require  user  interpolation  for  mission profiles intersecting ceiling/visibility areas in time frames between the valid time of the forecast.  NOTE:  Temporary conditions are not depicted in this forecast product. AFH11-203V2/ARMY TC 3-04.14-2  13 AUGUST 2015 43 Figure 2.25.  Ceiling and Visibility Forecast (17 OWS). 2.4.6.  Surface and Sensible Weather Forecast Products.  2.4.6.1.  How to use this product.  These products  depict common weather elements  for situational awareness.  The sensible weather areas (rain, rain showers, snow, etc.) depict the total area affected for the designated weather phenomena during the cardinal hour of the valid time of the forecast product.  These point-in-time forecasts are issued in 3-hour time  steps  for  both  mission  planning  and  execution  with  the  first  30-hour  time  frame continuously  monitored  and  amended  for  rapidly  changing  or  unforecasted  conditions.  The products issued for the 33-120 hour time frame are based on meteorological model forecasts  and  are  not  amended,  but  will  be  reissued  as  the  underlying  meteorological model is updated.  In most cases, the longer range forecasts will be updated at least every 12 hours and perhaps as frequently as every 6 hours. 2.4.6.2.  Strengths.  This product is easily understood and simple to use. 2.4.6.3.  Weaknesses. 2.4.6.3.1.  Weather  personnel  manually  render  surface  fronts  and  sensible  weather fields through the first 30 hours of the forecast period.  Machine rendering of surface fronts  is  not  practicable  at  this  time.    Forecasts  for  hours  33-120  do  not  contain surface frontal boundaries. 2.4.6.3.2.  Surface  fronts  on  AFW-WEBS  globally  fused  products  may  not  always line  up  on  the  boundary  between  two  OWS  regions  of  responsibility.    These mismatches  are  due  to  translation  differences  between  the  AFW-WEBS  mapping 44 AFH11-203V2/ARMY TC 3-04.14-2  13 AUGUST 2015 system and the map projections used at the different OWSs when the products were originally  created.    Development  and  fielding  of  better  rendering  technologies  will minimize these geospatial rendering errors.  Sensible weather fields are created via a separate process not subject to rendering errors when fused into a global view. Figure 2.26.  Standard Surface Features and Weather Forecast (CONUS).  Section 2B—TEXT PRODUCTS 2.5.  Aviation  Routine  Weather  Report  (METAR)  Code.  METAR  is  the  observation  code used to report meteorological conditions for aviation operations.  Full code details are found in AFMAN  15-111,  Surface  Weather  Observations,  and  an  aircrew  guide  to  translating  METAR code is found in Air Force Pamphlet (AFPAM) 11-238, Aircrew Quick Reference to the METAR and  TAF  Codes.    Elements  within  the  METAR  report  include:    wind,  visibility,  runway  visual range,  present  weather,  sky  condition,  temperature,  dew  point,  and  altimeter  setting.    Plain language  information  (Remarks)  may  be  appended  to  the  report.    METAR  was  adopted  by international  agreement  for  worldwide  use,  but  each  country  can  modify  the  code  (e.g.,  use statute  miles  versus  meters  for  surface  prevailing  visibility).    The  majority  of  METAR observations are collected, compiled, and transmitted by airfield automated sensing systems with minimal  to  no  human  involvement.    AF  weather  personnel  perform  detailed  augmentation  and backup/supplementing  of  the  airfield  observing  system  when  sensors  are  inoperative  or  when AFH11-203V2/ARMY TC 3-04.14-2  13 AUGUST 2015 45 conditions that cannot be sensed by the system are expected or are occurring.

AUTO  refers  to  an  observation  taken  from  an  unattended  Automated Meteorological  Observation  System  (AMOS)  i.e.,  AN/FMQ-19,  AN/TMQ-53,  Automated Surface  Observing  System  (ASOS).    AO1  is  an  AMOS  without  a  rain  vice  snow discriminator.  AO2 is an AMOS with a rain vice snow discriminator.  AO2A indicates that a human  observer  is  logged  on  to  the  observing  system  and  augmenting  or  backing  up  the airfield observing system. 2.5.4.1.  Determining  Augmentable  Observation  Elements.    AF  weather  personnel typically only augment for those items listed in AFMAN  15-111,  Table 3.1.,  and those that  would  adversely  impact  flight/ground  operations,  based  on  local  requirements.  These  criteria  are  those  that  may  be  unreliably  measured  by  an  automated  sensor.    AF weather  personnel  use  manual  observing  methods  (e.g.,  prevailing  visibility  reporting, thunderstorm  reporting)  when  augmenting  an  AMOS.    AF  weather  personnel  will  also back-up specific observation elements that are missing or incorrect due to sensor and/or communication failures. AFH11-203V2/ARMY TC 3-04.14-2  13 AUGUST 2015 Figure 2.29.  METAR Observation specifying an Automated Observation with Human Augmentation. 47  2.5.5.  Wind Speed and Direction.  See AFPAM 11-238, page 7.  Reported wind direction is the direction from which the winds are blowing.  Wind direction relayed by air traffic control agencies  is  in  magnetic  north.    The  wind  will  be  reported  as  prevailing,  gust,  or  squall.  Prevailing  (sustained)  is  the  most  common  and  is  the  average  direction/speed  over  the  2 minutes immediately preceding the observation.  Gusts are a sudden, brief increase in speed (with  a  variation  of  10  knots  or  more  between  peaks  and  lulls)  during  the  10  minutes immediately preceding the observation.  Squalls are characterized by a very large variation in wind  speeds,  with  showers  or  thunderstorms  often  accompanying  it.    The  term  “squall”  is used when the wind speed increases by at least 16 knots and is sustained at 22 knots or more for at least 1 minute.  The first three wind group digits will be the true (from) direction to the nearest  10  degrees  and  the  next  two  digits  are  speed.  If  winds  are  gusting,  the  next  two  or three digits immediately following the letter “G” will be the gust speed or peak wind speed.    Example:  The 25015G30KT group is the wind direction and speed. Therefore, 250 degrees is the direction (true), 15 knots is the sustained wind speed and 30 knots is the gust. Figure 2.30.

Visibility reports in Air Force METAR observations provide the prevailing visibility  at  the  airfield  observing  system  visibility  sensor.    See  AFPAM  11-238,  page  9.  Prevailing  visibility  at  other  sensor  locations  (usually  the  inactive  end  of  the  runway)  is carried in a METAR as a surface discontinuity group.       Example:  3/8SM (statute miles) is  the  prevailing  visibility.    To  convert  from  statute  miles  to  meters,  use  this  formula:  meter(s) = statute mile(s) x 1609.344  Figure 2.31.  METAR Observation Specifying Visibility. 2.5.8.  Runway Visual Range (RVR).  RVR is reported when the prevailing visibility is one statute mile or less and/or the RVR for the designated runway is  6,000  feet/1500 meters or less.  Based on a ten-minute average, RVR follows the visibility and begins with “R.”  See AFPAM 11-238, page 10. 2.5.9.  Type of Weather.  See AFPAM 11-238, page 11. 2.5.10.  Clouds.

Temperature and dew point affect pressure altitude and density altitude, which are used to determine runway length needed and helicopter power settings.  See AFPAM 11-238, page 14. 2.5.12.  Altimeter Setting.  See AFPAM 11-238, page 15.  International locations may report altimeter settings in hectopascals (hPa) or millibars (mb).  To convert from inches of mercury (in Hg) to mb or hPa, use this formula:  mb/hPa = in Hg * 33.8639. 2.5.13.  Remarks (RMK).  Remarks may be encoded in plain language and will contain any supplementary data.  See AFPAM 11-238, page 16. 2.6.  Terminal  Aerodrome  Forecast  (TAF).  Terminal  forecasts  for  Air  Force  and  Army airfields  are  provided  by  the  OWS  in  the  AF  standard  code  form  to  provide  advance  notice  of changes in  weather conditions  within a designated aerodrome complex.  TAFs include weather phenomena  within  a  5-statute  mile  radius  around  the  center  of  a  runway  complex  and  cover  a period  of  time  up  to  30  hours.    Forecast  parameters  include:  wind,  prevailing  visibility, precipitation and/or obstruction to visibility, sky coverage (eighths), icing, turbulence, minimum altimeter setting and pertinent plain language remarks.  Full code details are found in  AFMAN 15-124,  Meteorological  Codes,  and  an  aircrew  guide  to  translating  TAF  code  is  found  in AFPAM 11-238, Aircrew Quick Reference to the METAR and TAF Codes. 2.6.1.  Location.  See AFPAM 11-238, page 20. 2.6.2.  Type of Report.    TAF  is  an  airport  forecast  for a specific period (usually 30 hours).  See AFPAM 11-238, page 19. 2.6.3.  Forecast  Date  and  Valid  Times.    See  AFPAM  11-238,  page  21.    In  a  civilian  TAF (KSTL), the next  two groupings following the identifier are the date/time the  forecast  was prepared  (05  is  the  date,  and  1155Z  is  the  issuance  time)  and  the  forecast  valid  times (from 5/12Z to 6/18Z).  In a military TAF (KBLV), the group following the ICAO identifier will be the valid period of the forecast (from 5/12Z to 6/18Z).  With the advent of internet based  weather  data  retrieval  and  display  systems,  it  is  possible  that  the  computer  may  be displaying a TAF product stored in the computer cache, so it is very important to verify the date/time group of the forecast to ensure it is the most current product. Figure 2.33.  Example TAF specifying Forecast Date and Valid Time.  AFH11-203V2/ARMY TC 3-04.14-2  13 AUGUST 2015 49 2.6.4.  Change Groups.  See AFPAM 11-238, page 22.  The first line in any TAF shows the initial  or  current  conditions  prevailing  at  the  airfield;  subsequent  groups  indicate  an operationally significant change in weather conditions.  The type of change group designates the  characteristic  of  the  change.    TEMPO,  or  “temporary  groups,”  indicates  temporary fluctuations to the forecast meteorological conditions expected to occur at least once during the specified time period, for less than 30 consecutive minutes, and to cover less than half of the  period.    BECMG,  or  “becoming  groups,”  designates  a  gradual  change  in  predominant weather conditions starting at the date time group specified in the TAF and concluding at the end  time  specified  in  the  TAF.    The  time  period  described  by  a  BECMG  group  in  an  AF-issued TAF will usually be for one hour and never exceed two hours.  Foreign meteorological services permit two or more hour-long BECMG groups.  TAFs generated by NWS forecast offices do not use BECMG groups.  FM (or “from groups”), designate a more rapid change in  the  environmental  conditions,  usually  taking  place  in  less  than  30  minutes.    FM  groups specify  the  time  in  hours  and  minutes  when  the  change  in  conditions  is  complete;  in  the example from the KSTL TAF, FM060000 indicates a rapid change to the weather conditions that  will  occur  by  06/0000Z  whereas  later  in  the  TAF  period,  the  from  group  FM060830 indicates  a  rapid  change  in  predominant  conditions  concluding  by  06/0830Z.    Foreign meteorological  services  and  the  NWS  employ  PROB  groups  to  indicate  the  probability  of specified  conditions  to  occur  during  the  time  frame  of  the  change  group.    In  the  example provided, the NWS forecast office issuing the KSTL forecast is specifying that there is a 30% probability of thunderstorm conditions with a prevailing visibility of 2 statute miles between 06/0000 and 06/0600Z.  NWS forecasts will not contain PROB groups in the first 9 hours of a forecast and AF forecasts will not use PROB groups in TAF products. Figure 2.34.  TAF Change Group Examples. 2.6.5.  Wind  Speed  and  Direction.    See  AFPAM  11-238,  page  23.    VRB  represents  wind directions that are variable due to several factors:  1) forecasting a wind direction with great reliability  due  to  thunderstorms  is  not  possible,  2)  wind  speeds  are  6  knots  or  less  and  the direction  cannot  be  determined,  or  3)  wind  direction  is  varying  for  more  than  60  degrees.  The  latter  has  a  group  depicting  the  direction  range  (i.e.  210V300).                Example:  14005KT,  16010KT,  VRB15G30KT,  29008KT,  31012G22KT  and  30008KT  are  the direction and speed groups. In the first group, 140 degrees (true) is the direction, 05 knots is speed. VRB are winds with variable directions (thunderstorms) at 15 KT, with 30 KT gusts.  50 AFH11-203V2/ARMY TC 3-04.14-2  13 AUGUST 2015 Figure 2.35.  TAF Wind Examples.  2.6.6.  Forecast Visibility.  See AFPAM 11-238, page 24. 2.6.7.  Forecast Weather.  See AFPAM 11-238, page 25. 2.6.8.  Clouds.  See AFPAM 11-238, page 26. 2.6.9.  Icing Conditions.  See AFPAM 11-238, page 28.  Icing forecasts are for phenomena not  associated  with  thunderstorms.    When  multiple  layers  of  icing  occur  or  the  coding appears complex, consult weather personnel for clarification. 2.6.10.  Turbulence Conditions.  See AFPAM 11-238, page 29.  The turbulence group is for surface  up  to  10,000  feet,  non-thunderstorm  associated,  CAT  II  aircraft.    When  multiple layers of icing occur or the coding is complex, consult weather personnel for clarification. 2.6.11.  Lowest  Altimeter  Setting.    See  AFPAM  11-238,  page  30.    Forecast  minimum altimeter  settings  are  only  found  in  military  forecasts.    These  begin  with  QNH  (minimum) and end with INS (inches).     Example:  QNH2958INS, QNH2952INS and QNH2950INS are  read  as  minimum  altimeter  setting  of    29.58,    29.52  and    29.50  inches  of  mercury, respectively.    Internationally,  some  countries  use  hectopascals  or  millibars  (Q1016)  to measure  pressure.    See  Section  2.5.12  for  conversions.    Note:    minimum  altimeter  is  not included  in  TEMPO  groups.    Minimum  altimeter  forecast  during  TEMPO  groups  is  in previous BECMG group encompassing the time period. 2.6.12.  Forecast  Volcanic  Ash.    Volcanic  ash  is  included  when  U.S.  assets  fall  within  the boundaries  of  a  VAAC  ash-plume  forecast.    Volcanic  ash  is  encoded  with  the  contraction, VA, followed by the 3-digit height of the base of the volcanic ash, and the height of the top of the volcanic ash layer (both heights in hundreds of feet AGL).        Example:  VA100200 is volcanic ash with a base height of 100 (10,000 feet above the ground) and a plume top of 200 (20,000 feet above the ground). Figure 2.36.  Volcanic Ash Remark. 2.6.13.  Forecast Wind Shear.  See AFPAM 11-238, page 27. 2.6.14.  Temperatures.   See AFPAM 11-238, page 31.   Forecast high and low temperatures are routinely found only in military TAFs. 2.7.  Pilot  Reports  (PIREPs).  A  PIREP  is  an  aircrew  report  of  weather  conditions  at  altitude. The  FIH  has  the  format  for  transmittal  by  aircrews.    PIREPs  are  extremely  important  to operations since airborne crews can see a broader horizon and experience phenomena which may not be apparent from ground-based sensing systems or observers.  For example, cloud bases and  AFH11-203V2/ARMY TC 3-04.14-2  13 AUGUST 2015 51 tops,  turbulence  and  icing  may  only  be  evident  to  airborne  crew  but  the  levels  at  which  these occur  are  meteorologically  significant  to  other  aircrews  and  the  forecast  process.    Air  traffic control facilities may also submit PIREPs for worldwide dissemination.  PIREPS can be viewed in text or graphical format on AFW-WEBS. 2.7.1.  PIREP Text.  The format includes a “message type” (UUA:    urgent;  UA:    routine) and text element indicators preceding data groups.  Aircraft position is relative to an ICAO or VHF  NAVAID  (omni-directional  radio  range  [VOR]  or  combined  VOR/Tactical  Air Navigation [VORTAC] facility) with a six-digit group giving the relative bearing (first three digits) and distance (last three digits) from the ICAO or NAVAID.  “DURC” (during climb) or “DURD” (during descent) may be used as applicable.  Full code details  can be found in AFMAN 15-124. Figure 2.37.  PIREP Indicators. Table 2.6.  Elements for Issuance of Urgent PIREPs (UUA). Tornado/waterspout (+FC) or funnel cloud (FC) Severe icing Severe/extreme turbulence, including CAT Widespread duststorm/sandstorm Low-level windshear Hail (GR or GS) Volcanic eruption and/or ash (VA), in the air or on the ground Any condition that, in the judgment of the person entering the PIREP into the system, would   present an extreme hazard to flight. Example:  Routine PIREP 45 nautical miles northwest (315 degrees) of Scott AFB at 2224Z, and an unknown flight level. Aircraft is a C-21, observed a broken line of thunderstorms aligned north to south with occasional lightning from cloud to cloud and from cloud to ground.  Cloud bases are at 3,000 ft, unknown total sky cover and cloud tops at 34,500 feet.  Figure 2.38.  PIREP Example.   2.8.  Significant  Meteorological  Information  (SIGMET).  Non-Convective  SIGMETs  are  a concise  description  of  the  occurrence  or  expected  occurrence  of  specified  en  route  weather phenomena  which  may  affect  the  safety  of  aircraft  operations.  SIGMETs  are  an  unscheduled product issued any time conditions reaching SIGMET criteria are occurring or expected to occur within a 4-hour period. 52 AFH11-203V2/ARMY TC 3-04.14-2  13 AUGUST 2015 Table 2.7.  Non-Convective SIGMET Hazards. Severe (or greater) turbulence Severe icing Widespread duststorm Widespread sandstorms Volcanic ash Figure 2.39.  Non-Convective SIGMET Example.  2.9.  Convective  SIGMET.  Convective  SIGMETs  are  issued  by  time  and  region,  and  specify aviation hazards associated with thunderstorms.  Convective SIGMETs are issued hourly and are valid for 2 hours or until superseded.  If no Convective SIGMET criteria exist, then the bulletin will be issued saying “CONVECTIVE SIGMET…NONE.”  Convective SIGMETs cover one of three areas:  Eastern (E), Central (C), and Western (W), defined by longitudinal boundaries of 87 and 107 degrees west.  An hourly outlook is issued for each region.  The outlook is a 2-6 hour forecast of expected Convective SIGMET issuances and is updated as required.  See FAA AC-00-45, Section 6, for detailed information regarding Convective SIGMETs. Table 2.8.  Convective SIGMET Hazards. A line of thunderstorms at least 60 miles long with thunderstorms affecting at least 40 percent of its length. An area of active thunderstorms affecting at least 3,000 square miles covering at least 40 percent of the area concerned and exhibiting a very strong RADAR reflectivity intensity or a significant satellite or lightning signature. Embedded or severe thunderstorm(s) expected to occur for more than 30 minutes during the valid period regardless of the size of the area. Tornado, hail greater than or equal to 3/4 inch, or wind gusts greater than or equal to 50 knots are reported. Indications of rapidly changing conditions, if in the forecaster’s judgment, they are not sufficiently described in existing Convective SIGMETs. AFH11-203V2/ARMY TC 3-04.14-2  13 AUGUST 2015 53 Figure 2.40.  Convective SIGMET Example.  2.10.  Airmen’s  Meteorological  Information  (AIRMET).  An  AIRMET is  a  concise description  of  the  occurrence  or  expected  occurrence  of  operational  interest  and  potentially hazardous to aircraft having limited capability.  AIRMETs concern weather of less severity than that  covered  by  SIGMETs  and  usually  affect  at  least  a  3,000  square  mile  area.    AIRMETs  are issued every 6 hours, while unscheduled updates and corrections are issued as necessary.  Use of larger regional coverage means that only a small part of the area could be affected at any given time.    Graphical  AIRMETs  (G-AIRMETs)  are  graphical  forecasts  of  en  route  weather  hazards valid at discrete times no more than 3 hours apart for a period of up to 12 hours.  Forecasts valid for the first  6 hours correspond to  the text  AIRMET bulletin while forecasts valid for the 6-12 hours correspond to the text bulletin outlook. Table 2.9.  AIRMET Designators.

METSATs provide from space a wealth of flight planning information – e.g., cloud  top  heights,  thunderstorms,  turbulence,  jet  stream  locations,  fog,  and  terrain  features.  While  most  people  would  recognize  some  of  these  features,  consult  with  your  weather technicians  for  an  in-depth  analysis.    Weather  personnel  rely  on  two  types  of  METSATs  for weather information – polar orbiting and geostationary. 2.11.1.  Polar  orbiting  METSATs,  such  as the  Defense Meteorological  Satellite  Program,  circle  the  Earth  in  a  sun-synchronous  orbit  about  850km (450  miles)  high,  providing  most  mid-latitude  locations  two  passes  a  day  with  overlap  at upper latitudes. launched those through 2.11.2.  Geostationary  METSATs,  such  as  the  Geostationary  Operational  Environmental Satellites,  orbit  over  a  fixed  point  along  the  Equator.    These  orbits,  at  approximately 42,000km  (22,300  miles)  high,  provide  the  user  with  enough  images  to  animate  except  at high latitudes. 2.12.  Imagery Types.  Weather personnel use five different types of satellite imagery:  visible, infrared, multi-spectral, microwave, and water vapor. 2.12.1.  Visible  Satellite  Imagery.    Visible  satellite  sensors  record  solar  radiation  reflected from the Earth.  The recorded data is then converted into an image that looks approximately the same as a photograph (Figure 2.42). 2.12.2.  Infrared (IR) Satellite Imagery.  All objects emit some amount of infrared radiation.  Infrared  sensors  detect  radiation  emitted  from  the  Earth  and  its  atmosphere.    The  energy emitted by individual objects is directly proportional to the temperature of the object (Figure 2.43). Standard infrared pictures show the coldest temperatures as white (such as cirrus cloud tops) and the warmest temperatures (such as land and water) as black.  The temperatures in between  are  displayed  on  a  gray  scale.    Some  imagery  may  be  color  enhanced  to  highlight the  contrast.    Small  temperature  differentials  between  over-lapping  elements  make  analysis difficult  (i.e.  warm  stratus  cloud  tops  and  fog  over  warm  land/water,  or  cold  stratus  clouds over snow-covered terrain). 2.12.3.  Multi-spectral  Imagery (MSI).  MSI combines Visual  and  IR into  a color-enhanced 3-dimensional  image  (Figures  2.44  and    2.45) used to  discriminate between low, mid, and high-level clouds, as well as fog. 2.12.4.  Microwave  Imagery.    Microwave  imagery  is  used  to  see  through  cirrus  to  detect lower  clouds,  calculate  ocean  surface  winds,  rain  rates,  snow  coverage/depth  and  soil moisture.  Microwave imagery can produce RADAR-like images of weather systems, such as severe storms and hurricanes (Figure 2.46). 2.12.5.  Water  Vapor  (WV)  Imagery.    WV  sensors  view  radiation  at  wavelengths  that  are readily absorbed by water vapor in the atmosphere (Figure 2.47).  This allows an image of the concentration of atmospheric water vapor to  be taken without interference from surface features or other clouds.  WV can detect moisture movement into (or out) of a region even in the absence of clouds. AFH11-203V2/ARMY TC 3-04.14-2  13 AUGUST 2015 55 Figure 2.42.

Special  Support  Product  Types.  Weather  technicians  can  provide  a  broad  variety  of special  support  products.  Products  used  for  any  given  mission  depend  on  the  aircraft  type  and mission profile.  Low-level tactical airlift missions require different products than strike missions using  precision-guided  munitions.    Examples  of  special  support  products  are  Space  Support, TDAs,  volcanic  ash  advisories  and  forecasts,  Computer  Flight  Plans  (CFPs),  blowing  dust imagery, and snow coverage/depth charts.  Aircrews can find Space Support (including solar and lunar data) and volcano products on OWS or AFW-WEBS websites.  CFPs can be requested by following  your MAJCOM’s directives.  TDAs are usually classified and may be available over the  secure  web.    Local  weather  personnel  can  provide  an  in-depth  orientation  to  the  specific special support products used for your wing’s mission and how to acquire them. 2.14.  TDAs.  Weather  personnel  use  TDAs  to  translate  weather  data  into  mission  impact descriptions  (e.g.,  stoplight  charts  or  “go/no  go”  charts),  or  to  compute  weapon  system acquisition and lock-on ranges, illumination levels, and temperature contrasts between the target and background.  TDAs products may range from simple look-up tables and graphs to complex software programs.  Aircrews and Intelligence personnel interaction with the weather personnel is  essential  to  obtain  the  necessary  mission  and  target  data  required  to  generate  TDAs.    These TDAs  may  be  used  in  mission  planning  to  assist  weapon  system  choice  based  on  weather impacts  and/or as part of the Army’s  Intelligence Preparation of the Battlefield process  to  gain situational awareness.  TDA output is often classified because it discloses details of the mission or performance of the weapon system. 2.14.1.  Target Acquisition Weather Software (TAWS).  TAWS output predicts the impact of weather  and  time  of  day  on  the  performance  of  electro-optical  weapons  and  navigation.  These  predictions  assist  mission  planners  when  evaluating  tactics  and  making  “go/no  go” decisions.   TAWS can calculate sunrise/set, moonrise/set, and illumination levels for Night Vision  Goggle  operations,  to  include  atmosphere-induced  effects  on  illumination.    DoD employs  a  standardized  algorithm  for  solar  and  lunar  calculations,  therefore  aircrews  must employ  caution  when  using  other  sources  and  consider  time  zones  (Note:    Calculations  for Army  operations  are  often  converted  to  local  time;  whereas  AF  operations  employs  the Universal Time Coordinate).  It offers decision aids tailored for routes and areas. Table 2.10.  Sample Solar and Lunar Data.

This  is  a  rule-based  TDA  application  to provide critical friendly and threat weapon systems performance impacts (both positive and negative) for Army and some Air Force mission planning and execution. 2.15.  Volcanic Ash  Advisory Products.  The effects of a volcanic eruption can greatly impact operations  and  damage  aircraft,  particularly  engines.    VAAC  products  are  the  authoritative source  for  volcanic  ash  products.    VAAC  products  vary  by  AOR.    The  AF  provides instantaneous  eruption  notification  and  supplements  the  VAAC  products  for  a  consistent worldwide  analysis.    Products  are  available  on  AFW-WEBS  in  the  forms  of:    a  text  bulletin (Figure 2.48), animated graphics (Figure 2.49.) and/or an 8-panel forecast (Figure 2.50). Figure 2.48.

Section 2E—GROUND WEATHER RADAR AND PRODUCTS  2.16.  Ground Weather RADARs.  Imagery and data from weather RADARs are valuable tools for  obtaining  situational  awareness  and  identifying  weather  threats.    Modern  RADARs  employ sophisticated  signal  processing  techniques  to  improve  detection  and  provide  detailed  imagery.  This  enables  weather  personnel  to  interrogate  weather  and  non-weather  features  to  help 62 AFH11-203V2/ARMY TC 3-04.14-2  13 AUGUST 2015 characterize  the  state  of  the  natural  environment.    Products,  data,  and  imagery  from  weather surveillance RADARs are readily available via commercial, government, or military websites to meet  the  majority  of  mission  planning  and  execution  needs;  additionally,  detailed  imagery  is available  to  weather  personnel  via  dedicated  image  and  data  processing  terminals  to  assist  in threat identification and weather warning activities. 2.16.1.  Weather  Surveillance  RADAR  Networks.    Many  nations  operate  a  network  of weather surveillance or storm detection RADARs and provide U.S. forces with access to data or  imagery;  the  most  familiar  RADAR  data  source  is  the  Weather  Surveillance  RADAR, 1988  Doppler  (WSR-88D)  fielded  under  the  Tri-Agency  Next  Generation  RADAR (NEXRAD) program operating in the CONUS, Alaska, Hawaii and select territories and U.S. military  bases.    Doppler  weather  RADAR  networks  are  also  operated  by  Canada,  many European  Union  nations,  Japan,  South  Korea  and  Australia;  these  nations  release  some  of their  weather  RADAR  imagery  or  data  for  use  by  U.S.  Forces.    Other  nations  may  operate single site Doppler or non-Doppler RADARs with limited access by U.S. Forces.  In addition to  fixed  RADAR  systems,  the  AF  has  a  small  inventory  of  portable  weather  RADARs  for expeditionary  use.    Data  from  these  RADARs  is  typically  not  networked  and  the  RADAR site  may  not  be  operating  24/7  depending  on  mission  needs.    In  addition  to  the  portable RADAR  sets,  weather  RADAR  returns  that  have  been  “stripped”  from  tactical  air  control RADAR systems may be available for display at forward operating locations or bare bases. 2.16.2.  Basic  Weather  RADAR  Products.    Doppler-enabled  weather  surveillance  RADARs are  the  most  complex  of  weather  RADAR  systems  and  provide  a  variety  of  specialized imagery  for  interrogation  of  weather  conditions.    Doppler  RADARs  provide  three  main categories  of  information:    reflectivity,  velocity,  and  derived  products  based  on  the reflectivity and velocity returns.  RADAR reflectivity products will be most commonly used to  make  the  majority  of  decisions  for  aviation  operations.    Weather  personnel  will  use  the other  categories  of  products  to  interrogate  threats  and  make  decisions  affecting  weather watch, warning or advisory services. 2.17.  Reflectivity Products.  Reflectivity data is normally displayed in a plan position indicator fashion  with  the  RADAR  antenna  position  in  the  center  of  the  display,  but  it  can  also  be displayed  as  a  vertical  cross  section.    The  most  common  presentation  displays  the  RADAR returns  on  azimuth  and  range  bearings  from  the  antenna  at  ranges  out  to  248NM  from  the RADAR  antenna.    Advanced  Doppler  RADARs  employ  new  beam  geometry  and  signals processing  which:    1)  minimizes  display  error;  2)  provides  weather  personnel  with  a  better approximation of the physical state of the precipitation (liquid or frozen); and 3) better estimates the precipitation’s droplet size, shape, and distribution. 2.17.1.  Base Reflectivity Products. 2.17.1.1.  How to use this product.  Base reflectivity products depict the RADAR returns along  a  single  elevation  cut  through  the  atmosphere  (the  antenna  angle  at  time  of collection).    This  product  is  compiled  by  grouping  the  RADAR  returns  into  data  bins along  the  scan  azimuth  and  displaying  the  strongest  return  on  a  graphical  display.    The RADAR  product  is  available  in  a  variety  of  resolutions;  the  most  common  for  flight briefing  purposes  is  .54NM  which  offers  a  concise  view  of  the  RADAR  returns  out  to 124NM  from  the  RADAR  antenna.    The  full  capability  of  the  WSR-88D  Doppler AFH11-203V2/ARMY TC 3-04.14-2  13 AUGUST 2015 63 RADAR  depicts  RADAR  reflectivity  returns  in  .13NM  data  bins  out  to  248NM maximum range.  (See Figure 2.49) 2.17.1.2.  Strengths.    Base  reflectivity  products  depict  fine-scale  features  and  color coding  of  the  product  identical  to  that  of  the  composite  reflectivity  products  and  draws the user’s attention to the strongest RADAR returns.  The most commonly used products are those collected from the three  lowest  elevation scans of the RADAR (normally 0.5, 1.5, and 2.4 degrees elevation) since these elevation cuts provide the best views of near surface and lower tropospheric conditions most responsible for significant weather.  Most modern  weather  surveillance  RADARs  operate  in  clear  air  or  precipitation  mode depending  on  circumstance.    Clear  air  mode  permits  identification  of  weather  features such as cold fronts, sea breeze fronts, or other wind shift lines.  Biological targets (flocks and swarms of bats, birds, insects, etc.) are readily visible in clear air mode products as well as non-meteorological returns such as smoke plumes and chaff release.  If in doubt about the content of any RADAR product, consult with weather personnel. 2.17.1.3.  Weaknesses.  Images from the lower elevation scans may be contaminated with ground  clutter  in  the  early  morning  hours  or  in  nearby  storm  environments  due  to anomalous  propagation  of  the  RADAR  beam.    Strong  to  intense  RADAR  returns  with minimal to no motion should be viewed skeptically.  Images from higher elevation cuts (8.5  degrees  and  higher)  normally  show  RADAR  returns  30-60NM  from  the  RADAR even though the product display extends to 120NM.  Additionally, due to the continually rising  nature  of  the  RADAR  beam  (the  lowest  slice  is  elevated  by  0.5  degrees),  targets close to the ground near the edge of the RADAR’s range may be missed.  For example, at 100  NM  from  the  RADAR  site,  the  RADAR  beam  is  over  10,000  feet  AGL,  and  thus misses any features below. 2.17.2.  Composite Reflectivity Products. 2.17.2.1.  How  to  use  this  product.    Composite  reflectivity  is  created  by  processing  the base  reflectivity  data  from  three  volume  scans  to  produce  an  image  of  the  highest reflectivity  value  at  each  data  geographic  resolution  point.    Designed  to  provide situational awareness, composite reflectivity is a “one glance” product highlighting areas with the greatest reflectivity.  (See Figure 2.52) 2.17.2.2.  Strengths.  Composite reflectivity products are easy to understand; color coding of  the  reflectivity  values  is  designed  to  highlight  areas  of  potential  concern.    Red, magenta,  and  white  color-filled  regions  represent  areas  with  reflectivity  normally associated with significant weather. 2.17.2.3.  Weaknesses.    This  product  should  not  be  used  in  isolation  as  it  may  obscure storm  structure  features.    Reflectivity  returns  may  be  associated  with  severe  convective storms,  heavy  stratiform  rain,  or  non-precipitation  echoes  (i.e.,  biological  targets  or terrain  effects  due  to  anomalous  propagation  of  the  RADAR  beam).    Likewise,  the reflectivity may obscure lower level signatures, such as light precipitation. 2.17.3.  Other  reflectivity  products  .  There are varieties of reflectivity RADAR products created by the various RADAR systems that may be used in flight weather briefings.  These products are usually derived by post-processing the RADAR reflectivity returns and are used to assist in feature interrogation and threat assessment by skilled weather personnel. 64 AFH11-203V2/ARMY TC 3-04.14-2  13 AUGUST 2015 2.17.3.1.  Echo  Tops.    The  most  common  derived  product  depicts  thunderstorm precipitation echo tops.  This product is color coded for ease of use and is used to rapidly identify  precipitation  complexes  with  significantly  high  altitude  development.    (See Figure 2.53) 2.17.3.1.1.  How  to  use  this  product.    Echo  tops  products  are  available  as  standard resolution and “super resolution” products.  The most common product used in flight weather briefings resolves echo tops at 1.1NM resolution and is color coded for quick reference. 2.17.3.1.2.  Strengths.  The product is easy to read and fairly self-explanatory. 2.17.3.1.3.  Weaknesses.    The  echo  tops  product  represents  the  height  of  RADAR returns  exceeding  18dBz  (the  minimum  sensitivity  of  previous  generation  analog weather  surveillance  RADARs)  to  facilitate  storm  interrogation.    For  this  reason, cloud  tops  are  generally  significantly  higher  than  the  heights  displayed  on  the  echo tops  product.    The  product  may  have  a  “stair  stepped”  appearance  due  to  RADAR beam  geometry  effects  that  are  enhanced  by  the  way  the  algorithm  creating  this product collects and displays data. Figure 2.51.  Doppler Base Reflectivity.  AFH11-203V2/ARMY TC 3-04.14-2  13 AUGUST 2015 65 Figure 2.52.  Doppler Composite Reflectivity (Same Time and Location as Figure 2.51. Figure 2.53.  Doppler Echo Tops.   2.18.  Velocity  Products.  Modern  RADARs  employ  RADAR  pulse  strategies  and  signal processing  schemes  to  provide  measurements  of  atmospheric  motion.    The  RADAR  products generated to depict these motions are velocity products.  The CONUS WSR-88D network is the most extensive network of Doppler weather surveillance RADARs in the world and the product set provided is representative of the types of velocity products encountered elsewhere.  Doppler RADARs provide wind profiles of the atmosphere near the RADAR site or provide plan position view  images  of  larger  scale  atmospheric  motions.    AF  weather  personnel  are  trained  to interrogate these images and identify thunderstorm dynamics and locate weather features such as wind shift lines, frontal boundaries, or areas of low-level wind shear.  Note:  Weather personnel 66 AFH11-203V2/ARMY TC 3-04.14-2  13 AUGUST 2015 are trained to interpret Doppler velocity products.  Do not attempt to interpret a velocity product without the assistance of qualified personnel. 2.18.1.  Base  Velocity  Products.    The  most  common  velocity  product  is  the  base  velocity product.    This  product  depicts  the  average  radial  velocity  in  the  data  bins  arrayed  down  an azimuth (See Figure 2.54). 2.18.1.1.  How to use this product.   Base velocity  products  are color  coded to  show the inbound and outbound radial velocity relative to the RADAR antenna site which is in the center of the image.  Unlike conventional weather charts and diagrams which depict the direction  from  which  the  wind  is  blowing,  base  velocity  products  show  the  direction towards which the air is moving. 2.18.1.2.  Strengths.  This product is color coded to highlight areas with the highest radial velocities  within  the  scanned  range  of  the  RADAR.    The  scale  of  the  product  allows trained users to rapidly appraise the relative motion of the atmosphere over a wide area.  Velocity couplets are areas of inbound and outbound radial velocities in close proximity to one another.  The couplets are key elements in identifying wind shear, microbursts and for determining thunderstorm severity. 2.18.1.3.  Weaknesses.  Skill and experience is required to effectively employ information extracted from these products  in  military  decision making.  Since velocity  is relative to the  RADAR  antenna,  maximum  wind  speeds  may  be  significantly  greater  than  the indicated  velocity  and  determining  a  wind  direction  can  be  difficult.    In  addition,  these products are based on single elevation cuts and are subject to the same negative effects of RADAR beam geometry and propagation effects listed for the base reflectivity products (see paragraph 2.17.1.3). 2.18.2.  Velocity Azimuth Display (VAD) Wind Profile (VWP).  A VWP is created by post processing  the  radial  velocity  data  and  compiling  an  upper  level  wind  picture  of  the atmosphere within a 20NM radius from the Doppler RADAR antenna complex (See Figure 2.55). 2.18.2.1.  How  to  use  this  product.    VWP  depicts  atmospheric  velocities  in  a  format resembling  a  vertical  wind  cross  section.    This  product  also  offers  the  output  from  the preceding 10 volume scans of the RADAR to provide time continuity; the vertical array of wind barbs on the right side of the image is the most recent data.  Wind barbs are color coded  to  represent  data  reliability;  wind  barbs  color  coded  yellow  or  red  have  been created  from  radial  velocity  fields  with  higher  degrees  of  variability  than  those  color coded blue or green.  Gusty winds or wind fields with directional variability are common in the atmosphere. 2.18.2.2.  Strengths.  This product is intuitive and easy to use in determining climb winds or locating low-level wind shear. 2.18.2.3.  Weaknesses.    1)  The  product  displays  the  derived  winds  in  a  sample  volume nearest  to  the  RADAR  antenna  and  may  not  be  representative  of  conditions  at  a  more distant point.  2) Data fields marked with “ND” indicate sections of the atmosphere with insufficient  volume  of  RADAR  scatterers  to  accurately  derive  a  wind;  significant  wind speeds  may  still  be  encountered  in  that  layer.    3)  Derived  winds  on  the  VWP  may  be significantly less than environmental conditions if the 20NM sample volume around the AFH11-203V2/ARMY TC 3-04.14-2  13 AUGUST 2015 67 RADAR  antenna  is  disrupted  by  a  wind  shift.    This  effect  is  most  common  during  the period  immediately  surrounding  passage  of  a  strong  frontal  boundary  when  there  is significant  deviation  in  wind  fields  north  or  south  (or  east  or  west)  of  the  RADAR antenna  array.    Consult  with  trained  weather  personnel  when  the  derived  wind  data  is ambiguous. 2.18.3.  Other  Velocity-based  RADAR  Products.    Weather  personnel  employ  many  other velocity-based  products  to  interrogate  the  character  of  the  environment,  determine  storm structure  and  dynamic  effects  or  verify  features  detected  on  RADAR  reflectivity-based products.  Normally these products are not used in flight weather briefings. Figure 2.54.  Base Velocity with Wind Speed in Knots.  68 AFH11-203V2/ARMY TC 3-04.14-2  13 AUGUST 2015 Figure 2.55.
