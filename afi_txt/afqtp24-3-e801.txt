Spotters must be trained and use hand signals IAW AFMAN 24-306.  5.6. Warehouse Tug Vehicle Operation.  5.6.1.  Principals of operation.  5.6.1.1.  The operator must know the size of load that the vehicle will provide power for movement,  and  the  minimum  weight  ratings  for  the  pintle  hook.    The  specific  weight ratings for the vehicle can be found in  the  manufacturer’s operator’s manual.   This  will vary from vehicle to vehicle.  5.6.2.  Starting the engine.  5.6.2.1.  Set parking brake.  Parking brake lever must be set when the engine is not running.  5.6.2.2.  Ensure the transmission is set to N (neutral).  The engine will not start unless the transmission direction control lever is in neutral position and the battery disconnect switch is ON.  5.6.2.3.  Do not operate the starter motor continuously for more than 30 seconds.  If the engine fails to start after 30 seconds, allow the starter motor to cool for at least 2 minutes before attempting to start the engine again.  5.6.2.4.  Turn the ignition  switch fully clockwise, against spring tension, to  the START position, and hold while the starter cranks the engine.  As soon as the engine starts, release the switch.  5.6.2.5.  Depress the accelerator pedal steady and allow the engine to warm up at a fast idling speed.  5.6.2.6.  Check instruments and gauges for proper operation.  5.6.2.7.  As  engine  begins  to  warm  up,  gradually  push  in  on  choke  control;  as  soon  as engine is warm, push choke control all the way in.  5.6.2.8.  Remove foot pressure from the accelerator pedal.  5.6.3.  Towing operations.  See Pintle Hook Lesson Plan for additional information.  5.6.3.1.  During  towing  operations,  keep  the  vehicle  in  a  gear  range  that  will  provide adequate torques for negotiation of grades.  5.6.3.2.  Vehicle speed should not exceed 15 mph or the max speed limit allowed for the flightline (check SOP).  Speed should allow the vehicle and load to be safely stopped within an assured, cleared distance.  5.6.3.3.  Check the pintle hook connection to see that the hook is properly engaged with the drawbar eye or coupling.  Ensure quick release pin is fully installed.  5.6.3.4.  When  towing  loads  at  or  near  maximum  capacity,  and  operating  in  low  range continuously, closely monitor transmission oil temperature warning light.  This light will come on when the oil temperature reaches 250° F.  If the temperature reaches 250° F, stop the vehicle, shift to neutral range and run the engine at a fast idle until the oil temperature drops back down to a normal level.  5.6.4.  Stopping procedures.  5.6.4.1.  Remove foot from accelerator pedal.  5.6.4.2.  Apply gradual foot pressure to the brake pedal to bring the vehicle to a smooth, safe stop.  Avoid sudden application of full braking effort except in cases of emergency.  5.6.4.3.  Shift to neutral range and apply parking brake.  5.6.5.  Normal shutdown procedures.  5.6.5.1.  Idle engine for at least 3 minutes before stopping the engine.  5.6.5.2.  Turn-off all of the lights and accessories.  5.6.5.3.  Turn the ignition switch to OFF.

Check Engine Compartment Procedure  o Review the AF Form 1800. Ensure any discrepancy has been corrected. Vehicle Management annotated the discrepancy was completed. Approaching the vehicle. Damage or vehicle leaning to one side. Fresh leakage of fluids. Hazards around vehicle. Note:  Check that the parking brakes are on and/or wheels chocked.  The operator may have to raise the hood, tilt the cab (secure loose things so they don't fall and break something), or open the engine compartment door. Check the following: Engine oil level. Coolant level in radiator; condition of hoses. o o      o o o o   o  Windshield washer fluid level. o Battery fluid level, connections and tie-downs (battery may be located elsewhere). Check belts for tightness and excessive wear (alternator, water pump, air compressor)--learn how much "give" the belts should have when adjusted right. Leaks in the engine compartment (fuel, coolant, oil, power steering fluid, hydraulic fluid, battery fluid). Cracked, worn electrical wiring insulation. 3.  Start Engine and Inspect Inside the Cab (Get in and Start Engine) Make sure parking brake is on. Put gearshift in neutral (or park if automatic).  Start engine; listen for unusual noises. Look at the gauges. Oil pressure.  Should come up to normal within seconds after engine is started. Coolant temperature.  Should begin gradual rise to normal operating range. Engine oil temperature.  Should begin gradual rise to normal operating range. Warning lights and buzzers.  Oil, coolant, charging circuit warning, and antilock brake system lights should go out right away. Check Condition of Controls.  Check all of the following for looseness, sticking, damage, or improper setting: Steering wheel. Clutch. Accelerator (gas pedal). Brake controls. Foot brake. Parking brake. Transmission controls. Horn(s). Windshield wiper/washer. Lights. Headlights. Turn signal. Four-way flashers. Check mirrors and windshield. Inspect mirrors and windshield for cracks, dirt, illegal stickers, or other obstructions to seeing clearly.  Clean and adjust as necessary. Check emergency equipment. Check for safety equipment: List of emergency phone numbers Accident reporting kit (packet).    o o o o o               o  o    4.  Turn-off Engine 5.

Condition of tires--properly inflated, valve stems and caps OK, no serious cuts, bulges, tread wear, tires not rubbing each other, and nothing stuck between them. Tires same type, e.g., not mixed radial and bias types. Suspension. Brakes. Lights and reflectors. Side-marker lights clean, operating, and proper color (red at rear, others amber). Rear. Lights and reflectors. Rear clearance and identification lights clean, operating, and proper color (red at rear). Reflectors clean and proper color (red at rear). Taillights clean, operating, and proper color (red at rear). Right rear turn signal operating, and proper color (red, yellow, or amber at rear). License plate(s) present, clean, and secured.

Get in and turn-off all lights.  Turn-on stop lights (apply trailer hand brake or have a helper put on the brake pedal). Turn-on left turn signal lights. Get out and check lights. Left front turn signal light clean, operating and proper color (amber or white on signals facing the front). Left rear turn signal light and both stop lights clean operating, and proper color (red, yellow, or amber). Get in vehicle. Turn-off lights not needed for driving. Check for all required papers, trip manifests, permits, etc. Start the engine. Brake system. Test parking brake. Fasten safety belt. o o o o o  o o o o o        o o o   o  6.  Check Signal Lights 7.  Start the Engine and Check Test for Hydraulic Leaks o o o o  o o o o o  o o o o o   Set parking brake (power unit only). Release trailer parking brake (if applicable).  Place vehicle into a low gear. Gently pull forward against parking brake to make sure the parking brake holds. Repeat the same steps for the trailer with trailer parking brake set and power unit parking brakes released (if applicable). If it doesn't hold vehicle, it is faulty; get it fixed. Test service brake stopping action. Go about 5 miles per hour. Push brake pedal firmly. "Pulling" to one side or the other can mean brake trouble. Any unusual brake pedal "feel" or delayed stopping action can mean trouble. If the trainee finds anything unsafe during the vehicle inspection, get it fixed. Federal and state laws forbid operating an unsafe vehicle. Check vehicle operation regularly: Instruments. Mirrors. Tires. Cargo, cargo covers. Lights, etc. If the trainee sees, hears, smells, or feels anything that might mean trouble, he/she should check it out. Safety inspection. Document any discrepancy on AF Form 1800.  Sign-off AF Form 1800 to signify accomplishment of inspection.
