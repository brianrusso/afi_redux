At  least  two  crewmembers  must  be  awake  at  all times. (T-0). 18.3.  The installed LCP must be coded only with the operational inhibit code. (T-0).  LCPs with  operationally  coded,  launch  code  MCUs  may  be  installed  at  predetermined  levels  of advanced readiness as directed by higher headquarters or EAP. (T-0). 18.4.  Both  MCCs  must  authenticate  an  execution  order  before  initiating  an  enable  or  an execute launch command. (T-0). 18.5.  A fully programmed spare HDA must be available in case of failure. (T-0). 19.  Simulated  Electronic  Launch-Minuteman  Tests:  During  SELM  tests,  the  rules  in paragraph 4 through 16 apply except those in paragraph 15.1. These rules also apply: 19.1.  RS Removal. Remove the RS from the test LF(s) when: (T-0). 19.1.1.  Any ordnance item will be expended. 19.1.2.  Only one LCC is used in the test configuration. 19.1.3.  An anomaly occurs that is nuclear safety related or increases the possibility of an abnormal environment. 19.2.  Isolation Procedures. 19.2.1.  Cable  interconnectivity  between  operational  flights  must  be  such  that  a  single fault will not result in single LCC control of an operational flight or LF(s). (T-0). 19.2.2.  Electrically disconnect test LFs and test LCCs from the nontest LFs and LCCs on the command circuits of the hardened intersite cable network: (T-0). 19.2.2.1.  Isolate  LCC  command  lines  by  removing  the  corresponding  connecting links in the LF interconnecting box and installing command-line isolators. 19.2.3.  Verify inhibit command isolation immediately before airborne and ground tests. (T-0). 19.3.  Codes. 19.3.1.  Administrative  controls  and  procedures  must  positively  distinguish  code  media and devices containing test codes from those with operational codes. (T-0). 19.3.2.  Operationally keyed SDUs must be used during SELM tests. (T-0).  Replace all other operational  codes  at  test  LFs and test  LCCs with  test codes before  SELM testing. (T-0). 19.3.3.  Install test-coded LCPs in the test LCCs before the last-look inspection. (T-0). 12 AFI91-114  30 JUNE 2015 19.3.4.  For SELM tests involving ALCS use excluded test "X," "Y," and "L" code files to generate codes installed in test LFs and test LCCs. (T-0). 19.4.  Commands. 19.4.1.  After the test ALCS aircraft issues the first enable command, determine the status of each LF in the MAJCOM.  After verifying the nontest LFs did not process the enable command, the ALCS aircraft must transmit the inhibit launch command and poll the test squadron to ensure that no nontest facility received the inhibit launch command. (T-0). 19.4.2.  If  nontest  facilities  in  the  MAJCOM  respond  to  test  commands,  proceed  only after determining cause and completing necessary corrective actions. (T-0). 19.5.  Safing Actions. 19.5.1.  Missile  safing  pins  will  be  installed  in  all  test  LFs  from  SELM  posture  until Emergency  War Orders (EWO) reposture. (T-0). 19.5.2.  During  the  ground  test,  manually  safe  any  nontest  LF  in  the  same  squadron  for which status monitoring is lost. (T-0). 19.5.3.  Before or during the ALCS test, if status monitoring is lost for any nontest LF in the same wing, manually safe that LF.  Stop the test until safing is completed. (T-0). 19.6.  Airborne Launch Control System (ALCS). 19.6.1.  Make sure the test ALCS aircraft transmits only proper commands by verifying: (T-0). 19.6.1.1.  The  coded  portable  storage  unit  and  volatile  keying  assemblies  (VKA)  on board the test ALCS aircraft contain only test data. 19.6.1.2.  All commands transmitted from the ALCS aircraft to the test LFs are on the frequencies and tones designated for the SELM tests. 19.7.  Status Monitoring. 19.7.1.  For test LF s with an RS, two LCCs in the test squadron must monitor the status of  and  be  able  to  inhibit  each  such  test-configured  LF.  (T-0).    If  less  than  two  LCCs retain the ability to monitor or inhibit, stop the test until the condition is corrected. (T-0). 19.7.2.  For  nontest  LFs  at  least  two  nontest  LCCs  in  the  test  squadron  must  be operational  and  able  to  monitor  the  status  of  and  inhibit  nontest  LFs.    If  less  than  two nontest LCCs retain the ability to monitor or inhibit, stop the test.  The remaining nontest LCC must begin single LCC operations (paragraph 17.). (T-0). 19.7.3.  Do  not  start  testing  again  until  the  proper  number  of  LCCs  are  available  to monitor the status of and inhibit test and nontest LFs. (T-0). 19.8.  Last-Look  Inspection.    Before  testing,  a  Two-Person  Concept  team  composed  of individuals who were not on the maintenance team that configured the test LF must conduct a last-look inspection. (T-0). 19.8.1.  The last-look inspection must physically verify that personnel: (T-0). 19.8.1.1.  Disconnected  the  first-stage  ignition  branch  of  the  lower  umbilical  cable from the D-Box and capped the branch. AFI91-114  30 JUNE 2015 13 19.8.1.2.  Properly  pinned  all  safe  and  arm  devices  and  arm/disarm  devices,  and disconnected and capped the RS cable. 19.8.1.3.  Configured the test LF(s) properly. 19.8.1.4.  Removed the missile guidance set battery from the missile. 19.8.1.5.  Installed all command-line isolators properly. 19.8.2.  The  last-look  inspection  must  be  performed  again  if  the  launch  tube  is subsequently entered. (T-0). 19.8.3.  If  only  the  Launcher  Equipment  Room  (LER)  is  entered  (launch  tube  is  not entered) after the last-look inspection, another inspection must be accomplished to verify that personnel: (T-0). 19.8.3.1.  Configured the test LF(s) properly. 19.8.3.2.  Installed all command-line isolators properly.  KURT F.
