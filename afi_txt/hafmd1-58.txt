Williams)  Supersedes: HAFMD1-58, 12 September, 2012           Pages: 9 ______________________________________________________________________________ SUMMARY OF CHANGES  This  revision incorporates  changes  resulting  from  a  Headquarters  Air  Force  (HAF) reorganization.  Specifically, it incorporates AF/A9’s new role as Executive Agent for RAND Project Air Force (PAF) and removes all references to lessons learned, in accordance with the transfer  of  that  mission  set  to  the  Curtis  E.  Lemay  Center  for  Doctrine  Development  and Education.    This  revision  also  removes  all  references  to  wargame  support  and  support  for international  modeling  and  simulation  efforts.    A  statement  was  added  clarifying  AF/A9’s responsibility  to  ensure  analytically  relevant  data  is  captured  and  retained.    Additionally,  the organizational  chart  and  directorate  responsibilities  in  attachment  2  were  updated  to  reflect internal  restructuring.    Finally,  this  revision  incorporates  minor  administrative  and  structural changes to improve clarity and readability.  1. Mission: The Director, Air Force Studies, Analyses and Assessments (AF/A9), pursuant to 10 U.S.C.  §§  8031-8038,  and  as  authorized  by  paragraph  4.3.7  of  AFMD  1,  Headquarters  Air Force, and this Headquarters Air Force Mission Directive, assists the Secretary of the Air Force (SecAF), other Secretariat offices, and the Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF), in leading, carrying out, reviewing, and ensuring the analytic integrity of studies, analyses and assessments across air, space, and cyberspace domains.  The AF/A9 represents both the SecAF and CSAF in senior analytic venues as the Air Force (AF) chief analyst, and he/she serves as a member of the Air Force Corporate Structure (AFCS) and the Air Force Council.  The SecAF retains ultimate responsibility for all policies related to the Department of the Air Force (DAF).  Within his/her areas  of  responsibility,  the  AF/A9  prepares  policies  for  approval  and  issues  official  guidance, procedures, compliance items, and directed actions to ensure implementation of those policies.  2  HAFMD1-58  7 May 2015 The AF/A9 also assists the CSAF in his/her role, pursuant to 10 U.S.C. § 151, as a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS).  2.
