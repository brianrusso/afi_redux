General Concepts.  1.1.1.  The flow process charting technique shows a picture of the sequence of all operations, transpor-tation, delays, inspections, and storage of a work procedure. It includes information for analysis suchas time needed and distance moved. It is a simple device for visualizing each step of a procedure thatis often too long and complicated to be described in words. 1.1.2.  Like several other charting techniques, flow process charting can be used in a variety of appli-cations. This guidance aids the study craftsman by noting general applications, advantages, and limi-tations of this technique. 1.1.2.1.  Use flow process charting to study processes involving either personnel or material. Per-sonnel charting shows the process in terms of movements and actions done by work center person-nel. The activity shown on such a chart includes all forms of effort, mental and physical. A chartthat follows material can show the steps in an office, like processing forms or records as they passfrom one worker to another, or any material being processed in a shop, plant, or warehouse. 1.1.2.2.  When preparing the flow process chart, it is important to separate the events that occur tothe material from the activity of the person. Do not chart both on the same chart. 1.1.2.3.  Cost reductions most often happen as a result of simplifying, eliminating, combining orchanging the sequence of activities of the operators as they take part in a process. Focus attentionon steps done by individuals; however, do not overlook analysis of travel, delays, storage, etc.,that affects the overall time. 1.1.2.4.  A flow chart shows “hidden” costs, such as excess distances traveled, delays, and tempo-rary storage. Once these costs are found, improvements can be made. 1.1.2.5.  A chart shows steps in a process that may be deleted, combined, or changed to improvethe sequence and make the procedure more effective. 1.1.2.6.  A chart also helps improve the process by showing the steps (operations, inspections,etc.) that need to be given to another person. 1.1.2.7.  In general, the flow process chart contains a lot of detail. It is not easily adapted to a com-plicated process. Use the chart to study individual components of an assembly or one part in anoverall process. To avoid suboptimization (simply passing costs to another work center) ensurerevisions to a process do not cause an adverse effect on the overall process. 1.1.2.8.  The flow process chart gives most of the information needed to identify potential methodsimprovement, but it does not pictorially show the flow of work. Sometimes, however, such addedinformation is needed to develop a new method. For example, before a transportation step can beshortened, it may be necessary to see where floor space can be changed to reduce distances. Like-wise, it helps to visualize work stations, temporary storage points, and the overall layout of thefacilities. Thus, the flow process chart is often used with other techniques such as flow or stringdiagrams. AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003151.1.3.  Paragraphs 1.2. through 1.4. detail flow process charting and show how to use DD Form 1723,Flow Process Chart. 1.2.  Defining an Activity. The basic steps in flow process charting are the same ones that apply to allwork simplification. After identifying a process to be analyzed, determine the beginning and ending of theparticular process and stick to it. Don't be sidetracked by other processes that may occur at the same timeand place. Record all details of the process. Describe each step in the process and classify it as one of fivetypes of activities: operation, transportation, inspection, delay, or storage. 1.3.  Flow Process Charting Procedures.  1.3.1.  Enter each step in the process on the DD Form 1723. Use this form to record both present andproposed work processes. 1.3.2.  The first step in preparing a DD Form 1723 is to complete the data in the upper left corner ofthe chart. Be specific in identifying the process to be charted, persons or materials being tracedthrough the process, and the place and time the process begins and ends. 1.3.3.  Next, list steps in the process in brief narrative form in the column under the heading Details ofPresent or Proposed Method. Include every detail and verify this information with personnel doing thework. It is important to remember when listing the steps to cover the essential job parts (make ready,do, and put away). Refer to paragraph 1.4.4. for clarification of these “parts”. 1.3.3.1.  Make sure details are clear, specific, and listed in the order they occur. 1.3.3.2.  Enter distances when transportation steps occur. 1.3.3.3.  List quantity and time with operations, inspections, and delays. Use a standard unit oftime throughout the chart. 1.3.3.4.  If distance, quantity, or time varies in any given step, enter an average figure. 1.3.3.5.  Include every specific detail on the chart, or the chart will be of little value. Accurateanalysis and good improvements depend on an entire picture of current procedures. 1.3.4.  After all steps have been identified and listed, classify each according to the standard symbolsin column 12b. Draw a line from each symbol to the next. After giving each step a symbol, enter thetotal number of steps by each type in the summary box in the upper right corner of the chart. 1.4.  Work Flow Analysis. Analyze work flow as follows. 1.4.1.  When studying the data on the chart of the present method, ask these questions for each step. 1.4.1.1.  Can it be eliminated? Will elimination of this step simply mean another work center mustcomplete the task? 1.4.1.2.  Should it be combined with another step? Will this reduce overall cycle time? 1.4.1.3.  Should the sequence be changed? How does this change current delays and affect thequeues? 1.4.1.4.  How can it be simplified? Can technology be inserted to ease the workload? 1.4.2.  Use the checklist in Figure 1.1.. to analyze the present method flow process chart. 16AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003Figure 1.1.  Flow Process Analysis Checklist. CHECKLIST FOR ANALYZING A FLOW PROCESS CHART 1.  Apply the following questions to each step in the flow process:  1.1.  WHY is it necessary?  Can the entire process or some of the steps be eliminated? 1.2.  WHAT is actually done?  Are all steps included?  What should be done?  1.3.  WHERE should the step be done?  Should it be done in another place? 1.4.  WHEN should it be done?  Is it done in the right sequence?  Can it be combined or simplified by moving ahead or back? 1.5.  WHO should do it?  Is the right person (skill) handling it, or can some other skill do it better? 1.6.  HOW is it being done?  Can it be done better with different equipment or layout? 2.  Apply the following additional questions to the overall work process: 2.1.  Have proper administrative controls of the work been set up?  2.2.  How often is work checked for accuracy? 2.3.  When would an error be caught if present checks were left out?  Are there fail-safes that can be put in place to eliminate the need for human detection, harm, or error? 2.4.  How serious is the result of errors that are not found? 2.5.  Is a sampling check for errors enough? 2.6.  What inspections can be merged with operations? 2.7.  Can storage locations be moved or cut out?   2.8.  Can transportation be shortened or cut out? 2.9.  What are the causes of interruptions and exceptions to the work?  How can they be cut down or cut out? 2.10.  Will a new layout or use of a machine cut out the necessity for moving work? 2.11.  Can work be given to a location in a prearranged sequence? 2.12.  Are equipment and supplies properly arranged? 2.13.  Is there duplication of effort in whole or in part? 1.4.3.  Be careful when simplifying, eliminating, combining, or changing steps. Avoid haste whenmaking changes and showing results. Study and analyze the effect of each action. Do not combineoperations that require thinking with those of a routine nature. A change in sequence at one point maycause a problem at another. Oversimplification may impair controls. Placing too much responsibilityat one point may affect the quality of work. Be thorough in data gathering, accurate in charting, delib-erate in analyzing, and thorough in recommending changes. 1.4.4.  Every job has three parts: "make ready," "do," and "put away." "Make ready" is the time andactivity involved in preparing for a job, such as securing materials, going to the files for papers, orreceiving a work request. "Do" is the productive phase of work. "Put away" is the time involved incleaning up, such as returning papers to file, stacking and packaging finished work, or placing work indistribution. When analyzing the chart, it is helpful to mentally group all steps accordingly. Study "do"AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 200317steps first because if they are eliminated or changed, they automatically cut out or change accompany-ing "make ready" and "put away" steps. 1.4.5.  Question each step and make notes on the chart indicating possible improvements. Check typesof potential changes in column 12h. Check the form several times because second and third checksmay reveal possible improvements previously missed. 1.4.6.  After completing the analysis, prepare a new DD Form 1723 to show details of the proposedmethod. Show improvements in the summary in the upper right-hand corner of the form. Use the pro-posed process chart to help sell improvements. It may also be used as a permanent record of standardpractices for work center personnel to follow. 1.4.7.  The addition of a flow diagram chart can support the flow process chart, since flow charts bythemselves show little about the physical picture of the work area. 1.4.8.  In addition to or in place of DD Form 1723, it is permissible to accomplish flow process chart-ing using available computer software. The same kind of analysis outlined in Figure 1.1. should beapplied to the computer-generated flow process chart. Section 1B—Layout Analysis 1.5.  General Concepts.  1.5.1.  Layout analysis studies are used to improve production, ease physical exertion, and shorten dis-tances of travel for material and personnel. They concentrate on the physical flow of work. They maylead to substantial improvements and are very useful as an aid to other method improvement tech-niques. A layout study is defined as a systematic method to analyze procedures and facilities and todevelop a plan that gives an optimum workable arrangement of personnel and equipment. 1.5.2.  The primary objective of a layout study is to arrange equipment and facilities to achieve mate-rial flows at the lowest cost, with the least amount of handling, and in the shortest amount of time.Additional objectives include: 1.5.2.1.  Increasing efficiency by getting a straight-line flow of work and minimizing backtrackingin work processing. 1.5.2.2.  Providing each employee with enough space to work efficiently while, at the same time,minimizing total space. AFOSH/OSHA standards specify minimum work space requirements. 1.5.2.3.  Providing the best working conditions in the space available. 1.5.2.4.  Allowing expansion, reduction, and rearrangement of space to meet changing needs. 1.5.2.5.  Eliminating items of furniture and equipment not needed in the work center operation. 1.5.3.  Potential benefits of an effective layout are: 1.5.3.1.  Improved production. Streamlining the flow of work increases production and improvesquality. Labor costs are correspondingly lowered. Every moment saved in travel and delays aids inincreasing the production rate. 1.5.3.2.  Increased employee comfort and safety. A more comfortable employee in a safe environ-ment generates higher productivity and takes less time off. 18AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 20031.5.3.3.  Reduced labor turnovers. A more comfortable, attractive office helps recruit betteremployees and helps keep present employees. Consideration of the individual employee often pro-duces pride and loyalty. 1.5.3.4.  Improved supervision. Careful layout planning makes controlling the work flow andinspecting easier for the supervisor. 1.5.3.5.  Improved quality. Better layout reduces distractions and worker fatigue, eliminates frus-tration and undue pressures, and improves the quality of workmanship. 1.5.3.6.  Better space utilization. Valuable floor space is used more efficiently through effectiveplanning and layout. 1.5.3.7.  Reduced costs. Cost is the most important benefit. Speeding production, controllingwaste, and reducing labor expenses all save money. 1.6.  Layout Analysis Applicability.  1.6.1.  Steps necessary to conduct a layout study will vary with each situation. The techniques pre-sented in this chapter may give more information than necessary for a given study, but all might apply.Flexibility is the key word. 1.6.2.  The mere drawing of a proposed layout does not constitute a layout study. A hasty examinationof the work center or function may reveal inadequacies in the present layout, but a thorough analysisof procedures and facilities usually reveals underlying causes for problems that create low productiv-ity. Accurate and detailed definition of the problem is essential for problem solution. 1.6.3.  Normally, layout studies are originated due to problems caused by one or a combination ofthese: Ineffectiveness of current layout or work flow; changes in volume of production or services;changes in mission, product, service, or equipment; changes in the number of people in the work cen-ter; computerization; poor work environment; frequent accidents; obsolete facilities; or new facilities. 1.6.4.  Classify layout analysis studies according to the magnitude of the effort. 1.6.4.1.  Minor change to present layout. 1.6.4.2.  Major rearrangement of existing layout. 1.6.4.3.  Relocating into other existing facilities. 1.7.  Familiarization and Data Collection.  1.7.1.  Familiarization Phase. 1.7.1.1.  Define precise objectives and limits of the study. 1.7.1.2.  Check current organization, mission statements, and authorized and assigned manpower. 1.7.1.3.  Check current operating directives and previous studies completed within the function. 1.7.1.4.  Define individual responsibilities. An effective way to define who is doing what is tohave work center personnel prepare activity lists. 1.7.1.5.  Define machine and equipment needs. AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003191.7.1.6.  Consider any additional needs such as safety and security. AFI 91-302, Air Force Occu-pational and Environmental Safety, Fire Protection, and Health (AFOSH) Standards, containsguidance and direction for accident prevention. Other 91-series instructions address specificsafety environments. The 31-series instructions specify security considerations. 1.7.2.  Observation and Data Collection Phase. 1.7.2.1.  Document the present layout. A layout of the current arrangement of equipment, furni-ture, and elements of the physical space (walls, windows, doors, electrical outlets, lights, miscel-laneous structural obstructions, etc.) forms a background for comparative purposes duringdevelopment of improvements. A study of the present layout helps in determining where expan-sion or change is needed most, sets the relationship between various operations, and aids in iden-tifying the existence of duplicate or overlapping functions. It also serves as a checklist of existingequipment and furniture. Make sure the present layout is a graphic representation of the work cen-ter as it exists. Use one of three common methods: scaled drawings, two-dimensional cutout orstick-on templates, or three-dimensional models made to a convenient or standard scale. 1.7.2.2.  Prepare the current layout. 1.7.2.2.1.  Measure floor space involved. This may be done with a tape measure or by use ofblueprints. Be sure to validate any blueprint before use. 1.7.2.2.2.  Prepare a sketch of the floor plan, locating doors, windows, posts, fixed and mov-able partitions, light fixtures, and utility outlets. 1.7.2.2.3.  Sketch furniture, equipment, etc., showing types and distances from fixed refer-ences. 1.7.2.2.4.  Show any peculiar details such as floor drains, electrical outlets, plumbing, etc. 1.7.2.2.5.  You may show names of individuals or duty positions relative to furniture andequipment. 1.7.2.3.  Analyze results. Select relevant techniques to analyze work flows, personnel movements,and methods and procedures as they relate to the problems under study. How individuals relate tooperations must be a governing factor in any layout. Systematic study of operations, processes,and procedures involves individual (or group) activities. Two of the more common techniquesused for layout analysis are flow diagrams and string diagrams that are discussed in paragraph1.8.. There are numerous other acceptable layout analysis techniques available that may be bettersuited. Procedures for using these other techniques are described in various industrial engineeringperiodicals and books available at your library. 1.8.  Two Common Techniques Used for Layout Analysis. Other techniques can be found in the Hand-book of Industrial Engineering, 1992 edition, Chapter 67. 1.8.1.  Flow Diagrams. 1.8.1.1.  Prepare a scaled layout chart of the area under study. Use a standard scale when preparingthe chart (for example, 1/4 inch = 1 foot). 1.8.1.2.  Record on the layout, as near the point of occurrence as possible, each step in the workprocess. Use the same symbols as on a flow process chart. 20AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 20031.8.1.3.  Number each symbol in sequence. If the diagram is being used in conjunction with a flowprocess chart, match each step to the chart. 1.8.1.4.  Connect the symbols with a line to show the path traveled by the person or material underobservation. 1.8.1.5.  When presenting two or more work flows, use a different color for each flow. 1.8.1.6.  Study the flow diagram, along with the DD Form 1723, for improvement possibilities.Use the diagram checklist in Figure 1.2.. Figure 1.2.  Diagram Checklist. 1.  Work Flow: 1.1.  Does work flow follow a relatively straight line with minimum backtracking and crossover?  Where are the bottlenecks? 1.2.  Has each step been questioned and analyzed? 1.3.  Have other work flows been considered? 1.4.  Does furniture and equipment spacing consider at least minimum space requirements per worker as outlined in AFI 32-1024? 1.5.  Does layout consider person-person and person-equipment work flow relationships? 1.6.  Is there excess furniture or equipment?          1.7.  Would movement of furniture or equipment reduce or eliminate the number of moves or distances?  1.8.  Does layout recognize nature of work such as privacy or security considerations? 2.  Diagram: 2.1.  Does diagram portray its story clearly? 2.2.  Is diagram too elaborate and/or cluttered? 2.3.  Is it easier to understand than a chart or narrative description?  Is it more effective? 1.8.2.  String Diagrams. 1.8.2.1.  Mount a scaled layout chart (e.g., 1/4 inch = 1 foot) on material such as plywood or corkthat will hold pins, nails, tacks, etc. 1.8.2.2.  Insert pins, etc.; on the layout at each place people or material stop along the path throughoperations and processes in the work area. Put a pin on each exact location. Additional pins maybe placed along the path to show the exact route. 1.8.2.3.  Starting with the entry point in the flow, connect the pins with a string by looping eachpin, in correct sequence, to the end point of the flow. 1.8.2.4.  Label or otherwise identify each step. 1.8.2.5.  Use different colors or types of string to represent different workers, products, or materi-als. 1.8.2.6.  String may be measured to get distances, using the same scale as on the layout chart. AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003211.8.2.7.  Analyze the completed diagram for areas needing improvement (and congested masses ofstring indicating process bottlenecks). Refer to the diagram checklist in 1.2.. 1.9.  Layout Analysis Development.  1.9.1.  Analyze all data collected. This systematic approach is recommended. 1.9.1.1.  Determine facility location. 1.9.1.2.  Plan overall layout. 1.9.1.3.  Plan detailed layouts. 1.9.1.4.  Plan processes and machinery around material functions. 1.9.1.5.  Plan the layout around processes and machinery. 1.9.2.  Consider these needs. 1.9.2.1.  Set up space, storage, production, service, safety, people, and type of work. 1.9.2.2.  Furnish better working conditions to include lighting; use of colors; ventilation; noiselevels; safety; access areas; walls, partitions, and floors; communications; and location of breakareas, lavatories, water fountains, and locker rooms, etc. 1.9.2.3.  Set up telephone/information system needs including: number and placement of phonesand lines, intercom systems, and cabling, etc. 1.9.2.4.  Set up a work flow that follows the simplest and shortest path. 1.9.3.  Prepare proposed flow process and work distribution charts to optimize work flows and travel.Document the proposal on a revised flow or string diagram. 1.9.4.  Check all recommendations, discuss them with work center personnel and the functional super-visor, solicit recommended changes, and delete impractical data from analysis. 1.9.5.  Look at the differences between the proposed layout and present layout and evaluate these dif-ferences. Does the proposed layout: 1.9.5.1.  Produce a better product or increase production? 1.9.5.2.  Smooth the flow of work or reduce effort? 1.9.5.3.  Minimize material handling? 1.9.5.4.  Reduce costs, waste, and scrap? 1.9.5.5.  Release floor spaces or reduce wasted space? 1.9.5.6.  Decrease maintenance? 1.9.5.7.  Eliminate congestion or improve housekeeping? 1.9.5.8.  Facilitate scheduling or reduce quality checks? 1.9.5.9.  Make supervision easier? 1.9.5.10.  Reduce accidents or improve morale? 1.9.5.11.  Allow for future expansion? 22AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 20031.9.6.  Finalize proposed layouts, charts, and graphs necessary to present study recommendations.Include a concise implementation plan in enough detail for systematic implementation. 1.10.  Implementing the Proposed Plan.  1.10.1.  Present all recommendations and the proposed implementation plan to the supervisor, then toother key senior leadership personnel. Recognize that it is the unknown rather than the new that cre-ates apprehension. Sell major ideas of the study in the order of their anticipated acceptability to man-agement. Start off with those of a less controversial nature and follow with those most likely toinvolve more client hesitance. A close alternative will often be readily accepted, thereby avoidingcomplete rejection of an idea or proposal. 1.10.2.  On acceptance of final implementation plans, make sure all affected personnel are fullyinformed of the entire plan and their specific responsibilities. Set up a trial period to test new proce-dures and layout arrangements. Continued contact during the test period is necessary to make sure allwork center personnel understand, and to revise any aspects of improvement actions that are contraryto study objectives. Recommendations must be instituted as planned. Section 1C—Systems and Procedures Analysis 1.11.  General Concepts.  1.11.1.  Systems and procedures analysis is a specific technique used to solve information and paperflow problems. Systems and procedures are essential parts of the management process. They put man-agerial decisions into action. They provide for routine handling of recurring situations. 1.11.2.  Systems and procedures analysis is well suited for looking at paper flow and clerical activi-ties. This analysis studies the flow of paperwork, the forms used, and where and how work is done. 1.11.3.  The following terms are used in systems and procedures analysis: 1.11.3.1.  System. A network of related procedures integrated to meet an organization's objectives. 1.11.3.2.  Procedures. A sequence of operations set up to get uniform processing by telling whatactions are to be taken, who takes them, the sequence to be followed, and the tools to be used. 1.11.3.3.  Method. A manual, mechanical, or electronic means for individual operations. 1.12.  Preparing a System Diagram. A system diagram is a chart made to aid comprehension of a gen-eral activity and its components. It is used for doing relatively coarse analysis of an entire system. Thereis no specified form; however, the form used should give a framework for the procedures making up asystem. The elements in a system diagram should include the system description; procedures action; orga-nizational elements; skills; equipment; information inputs, resources, and outputs; and objectives andgoals. Information for doing a system diagram is collected through normal fact-gathering methods.Entries for each of these recommended sections are described below. 1.12.1.  System Description. Tell how the system is related to the mission, functional activities, andmanagerial goals. 1.12.2.  Procedures Action. Summarize what is in each procedure. Use one sentence for each proce-dure. AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003231.12.3.  Organizational Elements. List all the elements responsible for doing the procedures actionstatement in enough detail for clarity. 1.12.4.  Skills. List the Air Force specialties needed. 1.12.5.  Equipment. List the equipment used. 1.12.6.  Information Inputs. List information entering the system or procedure. The entry identifies thesource of the information. There is not always an input to each major action, nor is it necessary to listthe output of the preceding step as an input. 1.12.7.  Information Resources. List data sources such as reports, files, records, guides, and directives.Include in this section information resources added to, or updated as part of, the action. 1.12.8.  Information Outputs. List all information created or dispatched as a result of the procedure.Identify the format and destination of the outputs if going outside of the procedure. There is notalways an output from each major action. 1.12.9.  Objectives and Goals. Rank, for each procedure, the qualitative aspects of performance andthe quantitative measures used. 1.13.  Preparing a Procedure Chart.  1.13.1.  A procedure chart is specifically designed to give, in symbol format, the type of work foundin an administrative environment. 1.13.2.  It follows the flow of information between work stations and shows decisions made andactions taken by individuals in these stations. It also shows interrelationships between two or moreforms, forms and material, or forms and workers. 1.13.3.  A procedure chart gives a quick, accurate, and comprehensive picture of the total activity. It isused to show both existing and proposed procedures. When properly done, a chart is clear and can eas-ily give a complete and correct picture. The objective is to chart normal routine action, recognize pos-sible alternatives, and stay in the main stream of the procedure. If done well, the procedure chart willshow the following information about a procedure: 1.13.3.1.  The title, number of copies, and source of each document entering the procedure. 1.13.3.2.  The method of preparation, organizational element, and person preparing each docu-ment originating in the procedure. 1.13.3.3.  A symbol, with a short explanation to show each step in the procedure. 1.13.3.4.  Processing times and movement distances (optional). 1.13.3.5.  Final disposition of each copy of each document involved in the procedure. 1.13.4.  Figure 1.3. shows common chart symbols and their uses. 24AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003Figure 1.3.  Common Procedure Chart Symbols and Their Use. FOR PAPERWORK ACTIVITY Origination:  When a new document is created. Operation:  When some physical operation on the document is performed. Move:  When a document changes location or personnel. Delay:  When a document is idle. File:  When a document is placed in or removed from a formally organized file. Inspection:  When a mental verification process is performed. Information Take-Off:  When data is moved from one document to another. Destroy:  When a document is destroyed. Gap:  To omit activity not pertinent to the study. Cross Over:  To show that a document has taken a non-intersecting horizontal. Item Change:  To show that a document has taken on a different meaning. FOR PERSONNEL ACTIVITY Operation Inspection Move AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003251.13.5.  Preparing a procedures chart starts with completing a narrative that describes the work beingdone in step form, who is doing the work, and where it is being done. 1.13.5.1.  Chart preparation begins with entering basic information on the chart such as: ProcedureTitle, Data, and Analyst. 1.13.5.2.  All charting starts in the upper left corner and goes down and across to the right on thechart. The personnel activity flow is always on the left side of the procedure chart. Vertical col-umns are drawn to keep apart each individual organizational element used on the chart. 1.13.5.3.  There is only one personnel column per chart, but there is a document column for eachorganizational element on the chart. Explanatory comment generally goes with each symbol. 1.13.5.4.  Use present tense with personnel symbols (what the person does) and use past tense(what is done to the document) with the document symbols. 1.13.5.5.  If pertinent to the study, give the estimated processing time after each document symboland show the distance moved with each move symbol. 1.13.6.  Procedure charts are prepared on a DD Form 2050, Procedures Chart. Follow the rules inFigure 1.4. to prepare a procedure chart. 26AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003Figure 1.4.  How to Prepare a Procedure Chart. - A document can be introduced into a Procedure Chart in only three ways:                    Origination Gap (from outside the procedure area), or File (removed from a formal file). - When a document is introduced by     origination, provide the following:                      Title (Form Number, if Any)     Number of copies - Method of Preparation                     (1) For Example:                     Request for Personnel Action (SF 52)      3 - copies - typed - When documents are introduced from outside the procedural area, a     in this manner.     gap symbol is used AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003                  Title (Form Number, if Any) - Number of copies                    (1)  For Example:                                     Request for Personnel Action (SF 52) - 3 copies  Organizational Source                     (2)  To introduce existing logs or registers: Organizations Division 27        - When documents are introduced into the procedure by removal from a formal file, the file symbol is used as follows:                                            File Title                     (1) For Example:                                        Contract File Method of arrangement   by contract number 28AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003                  (2)  Example of a document being removed from a formal file and not immediately returned                   but used separately in the procedure:                     (3)  Example of a document being used and immediately returned to the form file: AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 200329- When action on a document is delayed, the D Delay symbol is used in this manner.

For example:        AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003- Flowlines are the connecting links between symbols.  The following rules apply in their use:                   (1)  Solid flowlines go into the top of symbols and out of the bottom as follows:33                         (2)  An exception to the above is the                   to show horizontal flow as follows: Move symbol.

This relationship is shown by always having the minor flow document move to                   join the major flow when they combine.  For example:                   (5)  All symbols fill the space between two guidelines on the chart form except the                    Item Change symbol which fills only half.

(6)  Each time a new vertical document flow line is begun, the contents of that flow should be                   listed.

Gap symbol is used to show a document leaving the procedural area.  It Section 1D—Work Distribution Analysis 1.14.  General Concepts.  1.14.1.  Division of work is a potential area for productivity enhancement and is an aspect of skilldetermination for manpower standards. 1.14.2.  Work distribution analysis is a technique used to evaluate specific steps and find each individ-ual's contribution to work center activity. This technique is useful when the work center consists ofseveral people and skills contributing to the same product or service. 1.14.3.  Work distribution analysis looks at work counts and man-hours associated with each respon-sibility. 1.14.4.  This technique is a good tool to check and compare present and proposed procedures duringstudy familiarization and consultant studies. 1.15.  How to Prepare a Work Distribution Chart.  1.15.1.  Preparing this chart takes three basic steps, and each step must be done accurately and indetail. 1.15.2.  First, have each person in the work center complete a DD Form 2030, Activity/Task List. Usethis form to record each duty activity and type of work done and estimate the average number of hoursspent on each. 1.15.2.1.  The DD Form 2030 does not merely quote an Air Force Specialty (AFS) or job classifi-cation statement. Use the task list to record a complete description of what each worker actuallydoes. Do not include ambiguous phrases like "checking," "administration," or "make contacts." 1.15.2.2.  Number tasks by activity (Col. e) to help in developing a work distribution chart. Thework unit volume (Col. d) will aid in work distribution analysis. 1.15.3.  The second step is to complete a work center DD Form 2030 for the activities. This listrecords the basic processes that are done by the work center. It includes all the major activities that aredone to meet assigned objectives. 1.15.4.  The third step is preparing a DD Form 1724, Work Distribution Chart. The DD Form 2030gives the information needed to do the chart. AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003371.15.4.1.  First, list the activity of the work center in the left column of the chart, in order of rela-tive importance. Leave space between each line. 1.15.4.2.  The columns headed "Tasks" are for listing the work done by each person. Complete acolumn for each person in the work center, listing each of the tasks in summary form. Relate eachtask to the activity list in the left column. Clearly separate the different tasks, since analysis isimpossible if a miscellaneous task is placed on the same line as the major job or operation of thework center. 1.15.4.3.  For purpose of analysis, list individuals doing the activities in the first column by grade,beginning with the person in charge. 1.15.4.4.  Record the hours per week spent by each person on each task in the proper column. 1.15.4.5.  Enter work count data on the chart when relevant. If possible, enter the work count asthe number per week to be consistent with hours shown on the DD Form 1724. If a weekly countis not representative, enter the natural frequency of occurrence (e.g., /MO or /YR). 1.15.4.6.  Sum the hours spent by all workers on each operation and enter the total in the columnbeside each item in the operation or process list. 1.15.4.7.  Total the hours for each person. 1.16.  Work Distribution Analysis.  1.16.1.  After completing an initial work distribution chart, do a systematic analysis of the recordedfindings. These questions help in examining the detail. 1.16.1.1.  Are skills being used properly? Is everyone being used in the best possible manner, orare special skills and abilities being wasted? Persons with higher skills should not do tasks that canbe done by lower skill levels. 1.16.1.2.  Is work distributed evenly? Measure the relative importance of tasks assigned to personsengaged in similar tasks. For example, two clerks of equal ability and grade normally should becharged with similar volumes of work. Spread the urgent and important tasks as evenly as possibleto make certain that all work is done according to schedule. 1.16.1.3.  Are tasks spread too thinly? Performances of the same task by many workers may meanduplication of effort. The assignment of a task to one person sets responsibility and enriches thejob. 1.16.1.4.  Are individuals doing too many unrelated tasks? A large number of tasks in any one col-umn may show that the individual has too many different tasks. Greater efficiency results if work-ers are assigned related tasks. 1.16.1.5.  Are the work center’s efforts misdirected? Is the work center spending too much time onrelatively unimportant operations or unnecessary work? Instances of misdirected effort are veryoften found in "miscellaneous" or "administrative" processes. 1.16.1.6.  Are there excessive supervision or consultation tasks? Resistance to delegation ofauthority can restrict creativity and cause unnecessary delays. 1.16.1.7.  What activities take the most time? Are they the ones that should take the most time?Normally, the largest total time is spent on what is considered the major activity in the organiza-38AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003tion. If the activity is a continuing one with several steps, the engineer may make a more detailedanalysis by preparing a DD Form 1724. Circle such man-hour totals to mark them for future pro-cess analysis. 1.16.2.  The answers to the above questions help develop improvement proposals. Prepare a newresponsibility chart or distribution chart that shows the recommended process and division of work.This will best display proposed changes and compare them with present procedures. Associatedreductions in man-hour requirements should be displayed to support the change. Section 1E—Histogram Chart 1.17.  General Concepts. A Histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of a series ofquantitative observations. The graph is usually a bar chart showing how the same parameter, measured ondifferent components, is distributed within certain minimum and maximum limits. The histogram is con-structed by dividing the range of a variable into equal intervals. A bar chart is then drawn showing howmany data are located in each of the intervals. A histogram provides information by means of the shape ofthe distribution and the dispersion. See Figure 1.5.. AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003Figure 1.5.  General View of a Histogram. 391.18.  Procedures to Develop a Histogram.  1.18.1.  Count the number of samples (n) for the process you are analyzing and record the total counts.  7.9 7.3 8.0 7.5 7.7 7.7 7.6 7.3 7.8 7.4 8.3 7.7 7.8 8.7 7.4 7.5 7.4 7.7 8.7 8.3 8.0 8.1 7.9 7.9 8.2 8.3 7.6 8.0 7.8 8.2 7.9 7.9 7.7 (n = 75)  7.8 7.8 7.7 7.5 7.8 7.8 7.9 7.4 7.5 7.9 7.3 7.4 8.1 7.0 8.0 8.0 7.6 8.1 8.4 7.7 8.1 7.7 7.5 8.1 7.8 7.8 7.4 8.4 7.7 8.1 8.3 7.3 7.5 7.6 8.1 7.2 7.8  7.7  8.2  7.7  7.9  8.2 1.18.2.  Identify the range (R) of data you have gathered. This number is the difference between thelargest (XL) and smallest (Xs) value in the data. R = XL - XS = 8.7 - 7.0 = 1.7 1.18.2.1.  Separate the data into classes (K). Use this table to identify the number of classes for dif-ferent numbers of data points. 40AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003     Points Counted             Classes (K) To Use                       51 - 100          101 - 250                              Over 250    Less than 50                         5 - 7        6 - 10        7 - 12       10 - 20 1.18.2.2.  Determine the width of each class (H) using the formula, H = R/K. Since the number ofsamples in the example is 75, use 10 as a convenient divisor. For the data used in this example, theclass width is 1.7/10 = 0.17. After rounding to the nearest tenth, H = 0.20. 1.18.2.3.  Identify the boundaries for each of the classes in the Histogram. Begin with the value ofXS, the smallest number in the range of counts, and add the class width H. Continue to add theclass width until the number of classes selected in the example is reached. In this example, XS =7.0 as the lower boundary. Adding 0.20 yields the 1st class ranging from 7.0 to 7.20. The nextclass begins at 7.20 and extends to 7.40. NOTE: To avoid having the same point as both the upper value of a class and the lower value of the nextclass, decrease the upper value by the correct decimal. Therefore, in this example, the range of the 1stclass is from 7.0 < X < 7.2, the 2nd class from 7.20 < X < 7.40, etc. 1.18.2.4.  Identify the number of samples in each class to determine the frequency of occurrenceand enable the construction of the Histogram. These counts give a horizontal Histogram.  Class Number of Counts Total  7.00 - 7.19  7.20 - 7.39  7.40 - 7.59  7.60 - 7.79  7.80 - 7.99  8.00 - 8.19  8.20 - 8.39  8.40 - 8.59  8.60 - 8.79  1 / ///// 5 /////  ///// //                           12 /////  ///// /////                         15 ///// ///// ///// ///                      18 ///// ///// //                               12 ///// ///                                      8 //                                               2 // 2          n = 75    1.18.2.5.  Construct the Histogram to show the samples in each class for this example. The data inthis example is centered around a value of 7.90 and is very close to a bell shaped curve. The His-AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 200341togram gives a view of where the counts are centered and the amount of dispersion of the data. SeeFigure 1.6.. Figure 1.6.  Histogram of Data. 1.18.3.  The data in a Histogram will not always be symmetrical as depicted in the example. The datacould be tightly centered around a point or greatly dispersed, or even bi-modal (having two distinctclusters around separated frequencies) potentially indicating two separate populations under study. Ineach case, evaluating the results of the chart furnishes useful information about the event or processbeing analyzed. See Figure 1.7.. 1.18.4.  Be aware of twin or multiple peaks. Their appearance indicates that the data is coming fromtwo or more different sources. If this is the case stratify the data so that the histogram uses only onedata source. 42AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003Figure 1.7.  Four Histograms Displaying Potential Results. Section 1F—Pareto Chart 1.19.  General Concepts. A Pareto chart identifies the problems that should be solved first in terms ofcomplaints, defects or cost. The Pareto chart is useful because it shows the areas that are experiencing themost problems and should be addressed first for correction. See Figure 1.8.. AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 200343Figure 1.8.  Pareto Chart. 1.20.  Procedures to Construct a Pareto Chart.  1.20.1.  Determine what factor (cost, defects, etc.) you want to use to evaluate different processes. Thesamples for this factor are itemized into the processes you'll evaluate. For example, if errors are occur-ring in a supply organization you can evaluate the number of errors in the processes of Receiving,Shipping, Storage, Delivery, etc. For documentation and validation purposes, specify the source of allcounts. 1.20.2.  Select a period of time to evaluate. The time period can range anywhere from a day, week,month, quarter to years. The samples for each process evaluated should come from the same timeperiod for meaningful evaluation. 1.20.3.  Draw horizontal and vertical axis for the diagram. The processes are listed along the horizon-tal line. The samples for the factor being evaluated are scaled on the left vertical axis. Values of 0 to100% are scaled along the right vertical axis. 1.20.4.  Total the samples for each process and use bars to represent the process. The process with thelargest total of samples is placed first on the far left. The remaining processes are entered, rangingfrom those with the largest samples to the smallest. If several processes each have few samples, theycan be combined and identified as other. 1.20.5.  Use a line to show the cumulative total when adding each additional process. The line goesfrom the tallest bar to the right and up until it reaches the right axis at the 100% point. 1.20.6.  Usually, the tallest bars indicate the largest contributors to the overall problem. Dealing withthese areas first is logical. However, most frequent doesn’t necessarily equate to most important. 44AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 20031.21.  How to Use a Pareto Chart. Use care when selecting the factor to evaluate different processes aspotential candidates for problem solution. Using total defects can show one process as a potential candi-date. But, by selecting cost of defects, a different process may show a larger impact. When a change ismade to a process as a solution to a problem, draw another Pareto chart after operating under the new pro-cess and check if the process has decreased in relation to the other processes evaluated. Section 1G—Scatter Diagram 1.22.  General Concepts. The scatter diagram shows the relationship between two variables. The rela-tionship is termed correlation or the influence one variable has on the other. The variables could comefrom the potential workload factors of a standard study, a cause-and-effect diagram, or any other sourcegenerating variables. The diagram is composed of an x-axis and y-axis. The effected variable is placed onthe y-axis and the cause variable is placed on the x-axis. 1.23.  Procedures to Develop a Scatter Diagram.  1.23.1.  Draw a scatter diagram by collecting the data to plot the samples. The individual samples areformed by the intersection of the (x,y) values. 1.23.2.  Collect 50 to 100 (x,y) data pairs that will form the samples on the diagram. See Figure 1.9.for a partial listing of point pairs. Figure 1.9.  A Partial Listing of Data Point Pairs. Number Bearing Size (mm) Cutter Speed (rpm) 1 2 ... 49 50 22.0 22.1 21.9 21.9 3600 3640 3550 3550 1.23.3.  Draw and label the x-axis and y-axis. 1.23.4.  Plot the individual samples on the scatter diagram. If samples overlap, place concentric circlesaround the point, with a circle representing each additional point. See Figure 1.10. for an example ofhow to plot the samples and a scatter diagram. AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003Figure 1.10.  Plotting a Scatter Diagram. 4546AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 20031.24.  How to Interpret a Scatter Diagram. After the samples are plotted on the chart, observe if onevariable affects the other. See Figure 1.11. for a variety of possible results. Figure 1.11.  Scatter Diagram Outcomes. 1.24.1.  If, as one variable increases in value the other also increases, there is a positive relationship orcorrelation. The closer the samples are to an imaginary line extending from the lower to the higherAFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 200347samples the stronger is the impact of one variable on the other. The more dispersed the samples fromthe imaginary line the weaker the relationship. 1.24.2.  The diagram indicating No Correlation shows the data points scattered all over the diagram.There is no indication of a distinguishable impact of one variable on the other. 1.24.3.  The diagram indicating Negative Correlation shows as one variable increases in value, theother decreases. As with Positive Correlation, the closer the samples are to an imaginary line extend-ing from the lower to the higher samples, the stronger the impact of one variable on the other. Section 1H—Cause-and-Effect Diagram 1.25.  General Concepts. A cause-and-effect diagram (also known as an Ishikawa Diagram) is used notonly to identify a potential problem but also to analyze it as well. Any problem can have many possiblecauses. The cause-and-effect diagram allows the user to identify potential causes of a problem in logicalgroups depending on the problem type. The primary factors that cause a product or service quality prob-lem usually relate to unwanted changes in manpower, work processes, equipment, or raw materials. Tofind the elements that come into play, follow a logical approach to identify the potential causes of a prob-lem. Figure 1.12. illustrates the structure of a cause-and-effect diagram. Figure 1.12.  Cause-and-Effect Diagram. 1.26.  Procedures to Develop a Cause-and-Effect Diagram.  1.26.1.  Identify what the problem is and briefly state it on the right side of the diagram. Enclose thisstatement in a box. Draw an arrow towards the problem statement extending to the left. 48AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 20031.26.2.  Identify the major categories of causes that potentially could cause the problem. Connectthese categories to the line pointing to the problem statement. 1.26.3.  List the factors in each of these categories that could cause the problem, using an idea gener-ating methodology such as the Nominal Group Technique or Brainstorming. Each of these branchescan have branches identifying more specific causes of the stated problem. See Figure 1.13. for anexample of this branching. Figure 1.13.  Detailed Listing of Causes. 1.26.4.  A very important element of identifying the potential causes of a stated problem is to havepersonnel that are familiar with the needs for completing the product or service. If a knowledgeablegroup of people is present, a very detailed breakdown of potential causes can be identified. If the per-sonnel are not familiar with the processes or needs, then too generalized a listing of potential causescould result. See Figure 1.14.. AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 200349Figure 1.14.  Detailed and Generalized Listing of Causes. 50AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 20031.27.  Benefits of Using a Cause-and-Effect Diagram.  1.27.1.  Any type of problem can be displayed on a cause-and-effect diagram. It doesn't have to relateto quality or timeliness. For example, personnel, safety, and scheduling problems can also be analyzedusing this diagram. 1.27.2.  The level of knowledge about the factors that influence the problem is soon evident by thelevel of detailed breakdown of the potential causes of the problem. The more branches to the causesthe greater the depth of knowledge of the personnel generating the causes. 1.27.3.  The cause-and-effect diagram allows the participants to visually focus on the various catego-ries of causes that could impact a problem. This makes it easier for the group to focus on generatingpotential causes. 1.27.4.  All personnel participating in the analysis gain from the interaction of ideas produced in thegroup. This interaction not only serves the purpose of generating ideas for solving a problem, but alsoaids in educating the participants about the various factors that impact the problem being addressed. Section 1I—Control Chart1.28.  General Concepts. A control chart is an effective tool for determining if samples come from thesame population and if the variation between samples is sufficiently small to allow the use of the mean asthe sole descriptive statistic of the population. 1.28.1.  Control charts (see Figure 1.15.) give important graphical information that can help deter-mine where variation in a process might be normal or abnormal with the latter case requiring furtheranalysis. By plotting the sample points in time order (the sequence in which they occurred), controlcharts can identify unusual changes in the process indicating the need for further analysis. There areseveral distinct data patterns that indicate whether we should explore data to include in our analysis -these patterns are shown in Figure 1.18. AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 200351Figure 1.15.  Examples of a Control Chart. 1.28.2.  There are two main types of control charts - for attributes data and for variables data. Attributecontrol charts are used to plot "go" or "no-go" factors such as an output being in or out of tolerance.Variable control charts plot specific measurements of a variable characteristic such as size, time, orweight of an output. 1.29.  Description of Terms.  1.29.1.  Assignable Cause. Any force/situation, not deemed part of the defined population that causesa sample to deviate significantly (exceeding established control limits) from the mean. For example,we may define a certain population of proportions as being "the level of daily productivity associatedwith the production of 40 to 60 units." If one day's productivity exceeded the Upper Control Limit(UCL) and the associated workload was 75 units, we'd know some force, not inherent to the definedpopulation, was at work. 1.29.2.  Common Cause. A host of small, independent, and elusive forces that act on events or mea-surements. Chance is normally responsible for the unassignable variation between elements of a pop-ulation. 1.29.3.  Observation. The selection of one element of a population. 1.29.4.  Population. Any set of objects that we may care to define. Each member of a population iscalled an element. 1.29.5.  Range. The difference between the highest and lowest value of any set of elements or obser-vations. 52AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 20031.29.6.  Sample. In this context, sample is assumed to be a random sample. A random sample is theselection of one or more elements of a population - each element having the same probability of beingselected. 1.29.7.  Sample Size (n). A sample may consist of one or more observations - the number of observa-tions is the size of the sample. For example: 23 (sample size is 1); 23, 27, 22, 21 (sample size is 4); and20, 22 (sample size is 2). 1.29.8.  Standard Deviation.  The square root of the variance.  The formula is s = 1.29.9.  Variance (s2 ).  The average of the squared deviation from the mean.  It's written as . Use n-1 when the sample size is 30 or less.  The formula is  s2 =  1.30.  Control Chart Description. Descriptive statistics enable us to compile information in numericalform about populations. Two characteristics of populations lend themselves to numerical description - thecentral tendency and the dispersion of populations. By combining a visual representation of data withnumerical descriptions, control charts enable us to make a visual and numerical analysis of the population. 1.30.1.  A control chart is a graph with a centerline, upper and lower control limits (LCL), and samplepoints. The center line is usually the average (central tendency) of the samples. The control limits arethe expected limits of the population based on the number of samples and their dispersion. The mostused measure of central tendency is the mean and the measure of dispersion is the standard deviation.Control limits are determined by adding and subtracting one or more standard deviations from themean (see Figure 1.15.). They are derived mathematically by sampling data from the process. In Fig-ure 1.15., the process is within specifications, but it's not stable. To meet the customer's needs, all pro-cess samples should be within the UCL and LCL. The variation displayed in the chart can bedecreased further by improving the process used to furnish the product or service to the customer. 1.30.2.  The normal curve (see Figure 1.16.) has 68.3% of the data points falling within one standarddeviation (plus or minus) from the mean; 95.5% of the data points fall within two standard deviationsfrom the mean; and 99.7% of the data points fall within three standard deviations. Construct a controlchart to display data samples using the steps outlined below. AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003Figure 1.16.  Standard Deviation Curve. 531.30.2.1.

Plot and connect the sample data points. 1.30.2.7.  Analyze the data by looking for out-of-control and unnatural conditions. 1.30.3.  If samples are within three standard deviations, analyze their variation to determine if themean can be used as the sole descriptive statistic of the population. Some populations have such broadlimits that the mean alone has little value as a description of the population. Observe how the standarddeviation compares to the size of the mean. If the standard deviation is small compared to the mean,the mean can be used as the sole descriptive statistic of the population. 1.31.  Analyzing Control Charts. After building a control chart and plotting the data on it, analyze whatthe data is saying about the process. As mentioned earlier, if the data on the control chart forms a normalcurve (natural pattern), the points will fluctuate at random and settle around the mean (center line). A fewpoints may fall near the control limits (UCL, LCL), but none of the points should exceed the control lim-56AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003its. A normal curve shows there is a steady, stable process that is not being disturbed by assignable causesfrom outside the process. 1.31.1.  If one of the data points exceeds the UCL or falls below the LCL, the process is "out-of-con-trol". When this condition exists, investigate the process to identify the cause of the variation and cor-rect it. Assignable causes of variation (e.g., machine out of alignment, fatigued worker, etc.) can becorrected bringing the process back into control. 1.31.2.  When the correction or adjustment for assignable cause is made, the process variation shouldresume its normal distribution pattern between the UCL and LCL of the control chart. This normalamount of variation (normal distribution) is due to common causes of variation. Common causes ofvariation, unlike assignable causes, cannot be entirely eliminated from a process. However, manage-ment can take action to improve the overall process and reduce the amount of variation due to com-mon causes by setting up process action teams, or providing training. 1.31.3.  Having data points fall outside of the control limits is not the only indicator of an out-of-con-trol condition. Data that fluctuates too widely or fails to fall around the mean can be classified asunnatural patterns of variation. An unnatural pattern usually shows that an abnormal condition isoccurring or beginning to occur in the process. It needs to be investigated as a problem source or areaof concern. There are several types of unnatural patterns of variation (see Figure 1.18.). AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 200357Figure 1.18.  Examples of Unnatural Patterns of Variation. 1.31.3.1.  Cycles. A short trend in the data that occurs in a repeated pattern where the patternbecomes predictable or systematic. This is an indication of an assignable cause because a charac-teristic of a normal (random) pattern is that it does not repeat. A cycle is caused by a process vari-able that comes and goes on a regular basis. 1.31.3.2.  Instability. Is identified by wholly erratic fluctuations that go beyond the control limitsor show erratic upward and downward movement. 58AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 20031.31.3.3.  Mixture. A pattern that falls near the control limits with an absence of points near thecenter line. This pattern is more commonly known as the "sawtooth" effect. A mixture is actuallya combination of two different populations on the same chart. 1.31.3.4.  Trends. A series of points showing a steady change in one direction, either up or downthe control chart. Even if there is up and down movement of successive points, if the general direc-tion of the points exhibit either an upward or downward movement, it can also be considered atrend. 1.31.4.  There are some other out-of-control or abnormal condition indicators. They each show thatsomething unusual is happening in the process that needs to be investigated (see Figure 1.19.). Figure 1.19.  Abnormal Data Point Occurrences. 1.31.4.1.  Two out of three successive points in Zone 3, on the same side of the center line. 1.31.4.2.  Four out of five successive points in Zone 2 or beyond, on the same side of the centerline. 1.31.4.3.  Nine successive points on one side of the center line. 1.31.5.  After building the control chart, plotting the data points, and interpreting the results, if no outof control conditions are found, the process is considered in control and free of assignable causes ofvariation. Continue using control charts to monitor the process and make sure it stays in control. Con-AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 200359centrate your efforts on reducing the common (random) causes of variation. This is how to achievecontinuous improvement in a process. 1.31.6.  This brief introduction on control charts with respect to their construction and use, givesenough information to allow us to look at some specific types of control charts. The number of sam-ples used in each example shouldn't be considered to be a "sufficient" number for analysis. Stronganalyses and conclusions depend on many more samples than used in the examples. 1.32.  Control Charts for Attribute Data. Attribute data are usually obtained by counting the number ofitems in one of two categories; e.g., go or no-go, pass or fail. For example, a light bulb either lights up orit doesn't light. In attributes data, the item either has the characteristic or it doesn't. 1.32.1.  Attribute control charts are useful in analyzing factors such as effectiveness, efficiency, docu-ment errors, reducing backlog and other forms of manpower analysis. These charts are useful whenthere are many processes to monitor. There are basically four types of attribute control charts: twotypes count the number of nonconforming parts or items, and two types count the number of noncon-formities on a particular part or item. 1.32.1.1.  The two types of attribute control charts that count nonconforming parts or items are theNP and the P-Charts. The NP-Chart plots the number of nonconforming parts or items in a sampleand is used when the sample size is constant (5 items repaired each day). The P-Chart plots thepercentage of nonconforming parts or items and is used when the sample size varies (15 items onday 1, 20 items on day 2, 25 items on day 3, etc.). 1.32.1.2.  The two types of attribute control charts that count the number of nonconformities on aparticular part or item are the C-Chart and the U-Chart. The C-Chart plots the number of noncon-formities per sample and is used when the sample size is constant. The U-Chart plots the numberof nonconformities per individual unit and is used when the sample size varies such as comparingdocuments that differ in size. 1.32.2.  Using a P-Chart. The P-Chart should be used when it's necessary to determine if sample pro-portions come from the same population. For example, we use the P-Chart in work sampling to ana-lyze the stability of daily productivity (the daily ratio of productive time to available or assignedtime); and we can use the P-Chart to determine what proportion of a given number of items we canexpect to be effective. The latter use is valuable if a work center's output is produced by defectiveitems; we can take samples of the items, plot the sample proportions of defective items to total items,evaluate the P-Chart, and arrive at a reasonable conclusion about the stability of the mean and disper-sion of the population. As an example, let's analyze the proportions of defective widgets produced atan Air Force base. There are 800 widgets produced each day of the study (n = 800). 60AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003     SAMPLE             NO.

Another type of control chart for attribute data is the C-Chart. The letter cdenotes the number of defects per item or group of items. The c symbol (c-bar) represents the meannumber of defects. The standard deviation of the population is estimated by the square root of c. 1.32.3.1.  Use the C-Chart when these two conditions are present: first, the average number ofdefects are far less than could occur if everything went wrong; and second, the area of opportunityfor defects is the same. The latter condition means that when you group elements, always use thesame number of elements per group. 1.32.3.2.  As an example, let's analyze the number of defects per group of five ARC-34s benchchecked by the personnel of a Com/Nav work center. We meet the conditions described abovebecause each group of five ARC-34s bench checked have considerably fewer defects than they62AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003could have if everything went wrong, and each group of five units gives a constant area of oppor-tunity.

Control Charts for Measurement Data. Measurement data are recorded observations of theextent or amount of a characteristic associated with a given element or group of elements. Some funda-mental characteristics are length, weight, and time. Workload data such as units produced, sorties flown,or items received can also be considered measurement data. The two types of variables control charts usedin quality improvement are the X (X-bar) and R charts. The bar above the X means an average is used andthe chart is called an "X-bar" chart. The R stands for range. The X charts are created separately but areused together since they each measure a different aspect of the process. The chart plots the average or64AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003mean of measurements in a sample. The R chart plots the range or variation of measurements in the sam-ple. 1.33.1.  Typical X-bar and R charts are shown in Figure 1.22.. They include basic elements commonto all control charts; i.e., the mean (center line), UCL and LCL. The X and R control charts are oftenused, since they give more information on the variation within a process than the charts that measureattributes. Figure 1.22. shows a fairly stable process. All the points are within the calculated controllimits and move in a random pattern. Figure 1.22.  Typical X and R Control Charts. 1.33.2.  If the plotted values of X and R fall on or above the UCL, or fall on or below the LCL, anunexpected event has occurred and should be investigated. It might be due to worn machine parts,AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 200365deviating from accepted methods of processing, a change in material, or fatigue on the part of theworker. 1.33.3.  Constructing an X Chart. The steps in constructing an X chart are: 1.33.3.1.  Collect the data. 1.33.3.2.  Compute the mean. Each mean is the sum of the measurements for the sampling period(i.e., daily, weekly, etc.) divided by the number of measurements taken during the samplingperiod. 1.33.3.3.  Compute the range, or R for each data point. For each sample, the range is determinedby subtracting the smallest value from the largest value. 1.33.3.4.  Compute the center line (mean) for each chart. Add all the values of the X data anddivide by the number of X data points. Each sample size should be the same size. Do the same forthe R data points. 1.33.3.5.  Compute the control limits (UCL, LCL) for each chart (X and R) by using the formulasthat apply. (See Table 1.1.) 1.33.3.6.  Draw the x (horizontal) axis and y (vertical) axis for each chart. Mark the scale on thex-axis of each chart. (The distance between the control limits on the X chart is roughly similar tothe control limits of the R chart.) 1.33.3.7.  Draw the X and R center lines and draw the control limits for each chart. 1.33.3.8.  Plot the X and R values on the chart. 1.33.3.9.  Analyze the control charts. 1.33.4.  Using the X and Range Charts. These steps show the development of an X chart and R chartfor five weeks of daily numbers of work orders completed.

Examples of X and R Control Charts. 1.33.4.8.  Analyze the control charts. Each chart should be analyzed for data "in control" beforethe data is assumed to come from the same population. 1.33.5.  Advantages and Disadvantages of X-bar & R Charts. AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003711.33.5.1.  The main advantage of the X and R chart is that it gives specific data about a single char-acteristic of a product or process that gives clues on how to isolate a particular problem. 1.33.5.2.  A disadvantage of the X and R chart is that, if used to measure products or processes thathave many variables, many charts are needed (One for each variable that is considered important).This can be very costly, so the X and R control charts are often used together with attributes con-trol charts. 1.34.  When To Use Control Charts. Deciding when to use control charts and which type to use isn'talways easy. It's not economical nor is there enough time to chart every variable for every process. There-fore, determine which key areas or characteristics of a process really need to be monitored and concen-trate on them. Take these steps: 1.34.1.  Flow chart the process. Identify the key areas or elements. 1.34.2.  Select the key areas or elements to monitor. Focus your efforts to prevent defects rather thanjust detecting them. 1.34.3.  Select the pertinent control chart and determine the sample size. Then begin collecting data. 1.34.4.  Construct a control chart and analyze the information. 1.34.5.  Continue monitoring the process. Constantly seek ways to reduce assignable and randomcauses of variation. 1.34.6.  Periodically reevaluate how closely you need to monitor the process using the control chartselected and the results being achieved. If there is too much variation in the process, work on improv-ing it and eventually providing increased customer service and satisfaction. Section 1J—Group Ware1.35.  Group Ware.  1.35.1.  Recently a technology has become available which can support and enhance the traditionalworkshop data collection process. “Group Ware” is a term used to describe technology which inte-grates multiple computers so that communication, data collection, and decision making can be accom-plished more efficiently. Familiar Group Ware tools include e-mail, conference call, videoteleconferences, while less familiar Group Ware programs may be online (Internet-based) brainstorm-ing tools or software-based data collection and consensus tools used in traditional face-to-face meet-ings. 1.35.2.  Several types of Group Ware meeting options are possible, based on the time and location ofparticipant involvement. 1.35.2.1.  Synchronous/Face-to-face: Participants are working at the same time, in the same loca-tion (e.g., meeting room). 1.35.2.2.  Synchronous/Distributed. Participants are working at the same time, but are located indifferent places. Imagine brainstorming with people located all over the world, and all of yourinputs are showing up on everyone else’s computer screens immediately. 1.35.2.3.  Asynchronous. Participants are making their inputs at different times (e.g., whenevertheir schedules permit, over the course of a week), typically done in a distributed manner. 72AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 20031.35.3.  These consensus tools (both Internet-based and in face-to-face environments) potentially offerthe most promise. An example of a face-to-face Group Ware system would be a conference roomwhere each participant has his or her own computer which is networked to all the others by a server.The individual respondents enter their respective data, ideas, opinions, or comments, and this infor-mation is combined as appropriate for decision making, and presented to the group for discussion. Thebenefits of Group Ware workshops of this type are: 1.35.3.1.  Cost savings. Recently, many Group Ware products have been made Internet-ready, sothat actual meetings or data collection (part of a meeting) can be conducted on-line with partici-pants from anywhere in the world. Obviously, travel costs can be greatly reduced. Many organiza-tions use such a capability for collecting data prior to workshops, such as having participantscomplete on-line surveys, brainstorm, prioritize, vote, or make comments using this Internet inter-face, so that the group’s information is consolidated and summarized when the traditional work-shop begins. 1.35.3.2.  Increased anonymity. Respondent ideas can be contributed for group discussion withoutthe author being identified. The group addresses the content of the submitted idea, without muchof the personality or rank dynamic present in open brainstorming. 1.35.3.3.  Increased speed of data collection and analysis. Rather than verbally commenting oneperson at a time (often allowing more “vocal” or “aggressive” individuals to monopolize thetime), a Group Ware workshop lets people contribute their perspective simultaneously (throughthe keyboard). Substantially more information can be collected in the same amount of time as tra-ditional open discussion. Additionally, the computer involvement allows for immediate documen-tation and calculations to be performed, eliminating much of the administrative burden of theworkshop. The group can get to the point of discussion much faster and have an automatic runninglog of the data and decision points reached by the group. 1.35.3.4.  More control over the workshop. The Group Ware programs often restrict participantsfrom drifting away from the workshop agenda or topic by controlling what they are working onand the way they can input data. Likewise, statistical analysis is usually available in Group Wareprograms that “flags” data which meets a criteria set by the meeting owner, such as low level ofconsensus by the group or data points which exceed a certain standard deviation. 1.35.4.  With some level of technical insight and effort, traditional desktop programs can be net-worked together to create a Group Ware platform. For example, AFMIA has developed an Excel pro-gram for collecting PAT and Frequency data from a group of people by networking computers andcreating “macros” which automatically consolidate the inputs. Other more “off the shelf” programsare designed to consolidate multiple inputs, but are less “manpower focused,” which may or may notbe an issue. 1.35.5.  In all cases, this technology requires adequate planning and competency to implement. Thecost savings, time savings, increased buy-in, and better documentation are all very valuable outcomes,but they will not be achieved if the tool is not properly understood and utilized. AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 200373Chapter 2 DATA ANALYSIS AND COMPUTATIONS Section 2A—Correlation and Regression (C&R) Analysis 2.1.  General Concepts.  2.1.1.  There are many uses for C&R analysis in the MEP. Some of these are the selection of workloadfactors and the development of man-hour equations, functional estimating equations, and functionalmodels. 2.1.2.  Before starting C&R, verify the accuracy of the input data and purge it of any collection errors.The use of previously discussed techniques, such as control charts and scattergrams, will aid you indetermining if data is good and logical. The end result of C&R is only as good as the data it's based on. 2.1.3.  Although correlation and regression are separate processes, they are usually done together.Regression statistics yield the equation and correlation statistics tell how good the equation is. 2.1.4.  Use C&R to evaluate the mathematical relationship between variables. Regression results in alinear or curvilinear equation that can be used for prediction purposes. For example, suppose that thenumber of line items processed in a base supply activity affects the number of man-hours needed inthat function. The man-hours can then be expressed as a mathematical function of the number of lineitems processed. 2.2.  Equation Forms.  2.2.1.  Introduction to Equation Forms. A mathematical equation provides useful information aboutthe relationship between varying levels of workloads and measured man-hours. The equation can beused to predict man-hours. There are various forms the equation can take. Each form has a dependentvariable (Y). This is the variable you are trying to predict. Y usually stands for man-hours. Each formalso has one or more independent variable (X or Xs), that are used to help predict the dependent vari-able. X usually stands for workload. The equations also have a set number of coefficients (a, b1, b2, ...,bn) that are developed with regression analysis. Commonly used equation forms and their individualcharacteristics follow. 2.2.2.  Linear Equation. The most direct relationship between two variables is the linear equation Y =a + bX. This equation shows a constant slope (b) in a line. A linear equation has two coefficients, "a"and "b", to be estimated with regression. 2.2.3.  Parabolic Equation. A relationship between two variables that allows for a change in the way Xis influencing Y can be represented by a parabola, Y = a + bX + cX². This allows the straight line, Y= a + bX, to curve up if the value of c is positive, or down if the value of c is negative. This equationform has three coefficients (a, b, and c) that will be estimated with regression analysis. 2.2.4.  Multivariate Equation. 2.2.4.1.  The equation form for two independent variables is Y = a + b1X1 + b2X2; for three vari-ables, Y = a + b1X1 + b2X2 + b3X3; and for any number (n) of variables, Y = a + b1X1 + b2X2 … +bnXn. 74AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 20032.2.4.2.  Each coefficient (b-value) of the individual independent variables represents an amountof influence from its corresponding X-variable given that all of the other independent variables(Xs) are held at a constant value. For example, the coefficient for X1 in the equation Y = a + b1Xlwould not be the same as the coefficient estimated for the same X1 in the equation Y = a + b1X1 +b2X2. 2.2.4.3.  Negative values for the coefficients may occur even when correlation between the depen-dent variables is positive. This may occur due to multicollinearity explained in paragraph 2.2.4.4..Negative b-values are acceptable, providing they pass the t-test of significance that shows if a par-ticular independent variable should be included in the model. 2.2.4.4.  Sometimes two or more of the independent variables are highly correlated. This is calledmulticollinearity. In such situations, these independent variables add similar information to themodel. Since the model is used for prediction, don't do anything if the correlation between theindependent variables continues into the future. 2.2.5.  Special Equation Forms. 2.2.5.1.  The two special curvilinear forms are the ratio and power. Use them with caution. Eachrestricts the prediction line through the origin and can unduly influence the form of the line. Theseforms must meet the same statistical criteria as for the linear and parabola. 2.2.5.1.1.  Ratio. This is a hyperbolic curve, Y = X/(a + bX), that requires the dependent vari-able (Y) of a line, to be transformed to (X/Y). Convert the ratio to a linear form by taking thereciprocal of both sides of the equation and then multiply each side by X. The resulting equa-tion is X/Y = a + bX. 2.2.5.1.2.  Power. This is an exponential curve, Y = aXb, that requires both the dependent andindependent variables to be transformed. Transform the equation by taking the log of eachside. The resulting equation becomes log Y = log a + b(log X). 2.2.5.2.  While the ratio and power curves are legitimate mathematical forms, they cannot bedirectly compared statistically to the linear and parabolic forms because of the transformationsinvolved. Transformation changes the distributional properties that the statistical tests are basedupon. Therefore, use these models with caution. Use a special equation form when: 2.2.5.2.1.  A parabola fits the data better than a linear equation, and the apex is within the datarange. One of the special curved equation forms may represent the data in the same manner asthe parabola but without an apex. 2.2.5.2.2.  A parabola fits the data better than a linear equation, and the apex is just outside thedata range. The parabola in this case restricts the utility of the standard and should not be used.However, one of the special curve forms may fit the data almost as well and give an acceptableextrapolation range. 2.2.5.3.  No-Intercept Equation. In situations where the range of the observed data is near zero, theuse of a no-intercept model (Y = bX) can be supported statistically. The intercept (a) from a linearequation must not be significantly different from zero for a no-intercept from to be used. 2.3.  Regression Analysis.  AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003752.3.1.  Least Squares Criteria. The regression technique used in the MEP is based on the "leastsquares" criterion for determining the equation (Yc) that best fits the observed data (Y). This methodestimates the regression coefficients (a, b1, b2, ... bn) of the general equation Yc = b1x1 + b2x2…bkxk insuch a manner as to guarantee the quantity å(Y-Yc)² is minimized—hence, the name "least squares"regression.. 2.3.2.  Specific Terms. Specific terms are used in regression analysis. Figure 2.1. shows the relation-ship between the equation forms and the regression analysis terms. Figure 2.1.  Relationships Between Equation Forms and the Regression Analysis Terms. EQUATION TERMS USED IN REGRESSION ANALYSIS VALUE OF m (Regression Coefficients) LINEAR PARABOLIC MULTIVARIATE - - two independent      variables — three independent     variables POWER (after     transformation) RATIO (after     transformation) m = 2 (a, b) m = 3 (a, b, c) m = 3 (a, b1, b2) m = 4 (a, b1, b2, b3) m = 2 (log a, b) m = 2 (b, a) 2.3.3.  The Dependent Variable. In regression analysis, the dependent variable is the variable of inter-est. The notation for this is "Y." Most commonly in the MEP, the dependent variable is man-hours.However, it could be any type of measurement about which a prediction is needed. Measuredman-hours for the dependent variable are usually costly to get. Therefore, try to find a relationshipwith a more easily obtainable variable that can be used to predict the dependent variable without mea-surement. 2.3.4.  The Independent Variable. Independent variables mathematically change with the dependentvariable. Therefore, they can be used to predict the dependent variable. Notation for the independentvariable is "X." These can either be the actual measurements of the independent variable or a transfor-mation of the independent variable, for example, X², log X, 1/X, or X. 2.3.5.  Regression Coefficients. Regression coefficients are the values resulting from regression anal-ysis and are used to form the regression equation. In the general equation form, 76AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003Y = a + b1X1 + b2X2 + ... + bkxk, there are m regression coefficients (where m = k + 1). The m-coeffi-cients (a, b1, b2, ..., bk) include the "b" coefficients for the independent variables, as well as the "a,"that is the Y-intercept. 2.3.6.  Regression Analysis Assumptions. 2.3.6.1.  The form of the equation is linear with respect to the coefficients (b). This still allows forthe transformation of the independent variables (X) into a power (X²), reciprocal (1/X), or log Xas needed for an equation form. 2.3.6.2.  The values of the independent variables can be measured with little or no variability. 2.3.6.3.  The residuals are defined as the difference between the observed and calculatedman-hours (Y-Yc). Assumptions regarding residuals follow. 2.3.6.3.1.  Residuals are independent of each other. 2.3.6.3.2.  Residuals are normally distributed and have the same variance regardless of thevalue of the independent variable. 2.3.7.  Single Location Regression Analysis. Use time series regression when multiple data sets can beobtained by one of these methods. 2.3.7.1.  Use historical data when reliable monthly man-hour and workload accounting recordsexist. Regress a minimum of 6 months, preferably 12 months, historical man-hour data againstmonthly workload data for each of the monthly periods. An example is a base that has accuratereporting systems for flying hours (X) and productive man-hours (Y). Use the historical data forthe past year to get an equation that relates flying hours to productive man-hours. Evaluate theequation with the R² and V criteria, and the F-test. Figure 2.2. shows an example of this use ofregression analysis. AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 200377Figure 2.2.

The second way to get multiple data sets is to set up a collection cycle to gather the nec-essary measurement data over a given time period. 2.4.  Number of Input Points.  2.4.1.  The number of input points in regression analysis becomes important in testing the significanceof the regression line. To have a meaningful test, there should be enough inputs to allow a good esti-mation of the variability within the data after the coefficients are estimated. 78AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 20032.4.2.  Using only the statistic R² (coefficient of determination) as a measure of “goodness” can bemisleading when the number of coefficients is very near the number of input data sets. Mathemati-cally, any number of points can be fit exactly with enough coefficients in the equation. For example,three points fit exactly an equation with three coefficients (Y = a + bX + cX²), thus producing R² = 1. 2.4.3.  Input points are needed for regression analysis. 2.4.3.1.  When the total number of locations is two, three, or four, it is a small population. Measureall locations. Statistical tests (F-test and t-test) are not needed. 2.4.3.2.  When the total population consists of five or more locations, use the minimum number ofinputs, outlined in AFMAN 38-208, Volume 1, Table 3.4, as a guide and get one or two more ifpossible. 2.4.3.3.  In regression analysis, statistical tests are based on (n-1) and (n-m), called degrees of free-dom. The total number of observations or data points is n, and m is the total number of coeffi-cients. Therefore, the more points in the sample, the more information for the statistical test. 2.4.3.4.  The inputs should adequately portray the behavior of the data at various levels of work-load. 2.5.  Correlation Analysis.  2.5.1.  Correlation Statistics. The statistics (R², Syx, and V) are needed to evaluate how well an equa-tion represents the observed data (Y). These measures are derived from the variation within the mea-sured man-hours. The sums of squares and the types of variation used to form these overall statisticsare presented here and summarized in Figure 2.3.. AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 200379Figure 2.3.

Total Sum of Squares (TSS). When it is necessary to predict man-hours (Y), the best predictoris Y-bar, the mean of measured man-hours. Hence, the total variation within the system is associatedwith the total sum of the squared deviations (TSS) of the Y-values about its mean.  80AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 20032.5.3.  Standard Deviation of Y (sy). The standard deviation of the measured man-hours (Y) is esti-mated by the square root of TSS divided by the degrees of freedom (n-1).  This expression can be put in a form that is easier to compute:  2.5.4.  Sum of Squares Explained by Regression (SSR). When the information in the X-values is usedto form a prediction equation (Yc = a + bX), the best estimate of a new Y-value is Yc instead of Y-bar.The amount of reduction is defined as the SSR. The degrees of freedom for SSR are (m-1).  2.5.5.  Sum of Squares Unexplained by Regression (SSE). The remaining variation in Y is defined asthe SSE.  2.5.6.  Standard Error of the Estimate (Syx). When SSE is divided by the degrees of freedom (n-m), thevariation that remains in the regression system is estimated. The square root of this is defined as thestandard error of the estimate. This is used to calculate the coefficient of variation.  2.5.7.  Coefficient of Variation (V). The standard error of the estimate gives a measure of how theobserved data is scattered about the regression line. To compare this information between differentequations, a relative measure is needed. Hence, the coefficient of variation is defined as the standarderror of the estimate divided by the average man-hours. This indicates how large the standard devia-tion is with relation to the mean.  AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 200381This yields a measure that has no dimension and can be used to set up criteria for the levels of accept-able variability in an equation. 2.5.8.  Coefficient of Determination (R²). When the coefficients in the equation are estimated with the"least squares" method, an additional relationship exists between these sum of squares. By dividingboth sides of the equation by the total sum of the squares (TSS), two proportions result that sum toone.  ,  or R² is defined as the proportion of the total variation that is explained by the regression line. R2 values range from zero to one. R² = EXPLAINED/TOTAL = SSR/TSS When the regression explains most of the variation, R² approaches the value of one. When there is a large amount of unexplained variation, R² approach zero. The square root of the coefficient of determination (R) is defined as the coefficient of correlation. Correlation ranges from a minus one to a plus one. 2.6.  Significance Tests.  2.6.1.  The F-test. 2.6.1.1.  To be useful in prediction, an equation must explain or account for more of the variabilityin the man-hours than is left unexplained. The F-test is used for this determination. To do theF-test, two values are needed; the test statistic (F) and the critical value (F*). 2.6.1.2.  The test statistic (F) is the ratio of the variance explained by regression to the unexplainedvariance. Variances are obtained by dividing sum of squares with their respective degrees of free-dom.    F = SSR/(m-1)            SSE/(n-m)  82AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003F, expressed as a function of R2 is:  2.6.1.3.  The critical value for the F-test, [F* = F(1-a, m-1, n-m)], comes from the f-Table atAttachment 2. The degrees of freedom for the numerator (m-1) are arrayed across the top of theTable and the degrees of freedom for the denominator (n-m) are listed down the left side. 2.6.1.4.  If the test statistic is larger or equal to the critical value (F> F*), the equation explains asignificant amount of variation of man-hours. 2.6.2.  The t-test. 2.6.2.1.  The t-test determines if the individual coefficients of an equation are significantly differ-ent from zero. A value whose coefficient is not significantly different from zero contributes noth-ing to the prediction equation and should not be retained. As with the F-test, a test statistic and acritical value are needed to do this test. 2.6.2.2.  The test statistic for multivariate coefficients (tb) is usually calculated by automated sta-tistical routines; however, in the case of only two independent variables (X1 and X2 ), it may becalculated manually. In other multivariate situations (more than two independent variables), use ofa reliable automated statistical package to calculate and print out these t-values (confidence levels)will be acceptable. 2.6.2.3.  The critical value, [t* = t(1-a/2, n-1)], comes from the t-Table at Attachment 2. The con-fidence level (1-a) is set at 80%, ( = 0.20). This is based on the decision that to drop a variable outof the equation when it may be valuable is more damaging than to leave a variable in the equationwhen it may be of little value. Because the t-test is two tailed (concerned with values positivelyand negatively different from zero (see Figure 2.4.)), the alpha-level is split and the critical valuebecomes [t*=t(.90, n-1)]. AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 200383Figure 2.4.  Decision Rule for the t-test. 2.6.2.4.  If the test statistic (t) calculated from the data (considering its absolute value) is greaterthan or equal to the critical value (Table value), the coefficient in question is significantly differentfrom zero and should be used in the equation. 2.7.  Evaluation of the Results and Model Selection.  2.7.1.  The most common use of regression analysis in the MEP is to develop equations that expressthe required man-hours for a work center in terms of one or more workload factors (WLFs). For onework center, several equations may be developed. The selection of one of these equations to be themanpower model for that work center needs a balance between several different factors. The majorconsiderations are highlighted here. 2.7.2.  Make sure the selected equation is built with logical workload factors. 2.7.3.  Select one equation from a group of equations based on both the overall statistics of the equa-tions and the simplicity of the equation form itself. 2.7.3.1.  The equation with the best overall statistics (largest R² and smallest V) is the equation thatmost closely fits the data. Such an equation is favored in the selection process. 2.7.3.2.  When the overall statistics for equations are close in value, select the simplest equation. 2.7.4.  Before selecting a regression model, it must pass the F-test (that is, it must explain a significantportion of the variability). 2.7.5.  The coefficients for the parabola and multivariate equations should pass the t-test (be signifi-cantly different from zero) to be kept in the equation. However, there may be situations that favorkeeping a variable in the equation that does not pass the t-test. The worst consequence of such a deci-sion is the retention of a variable that contributes very little statistically to the equation, yet manpoweris expended to collect WLF data. 84AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 20032.7.6.  An equation must also meet both the realistic and the economic criteria to be acceptable as amanpower model. An equation is realistic when it has a positive slope, with no net loss of man-hoursfor an increase in workload within the extrapolation range of the model. Negative Y-intercepts in themodel are allowed. However, exclude negative values of Y from the extrapolation range. 2.7.7.  An equation is economical if, at any point in the model, a unit increase in workload causes anincrease in manpower when compared to all previous per unit changes in manpower. 2.7.8.  Man-hour equation coefficients meet both the realistic and economic criteria when: 2.7.8.1.  The linear model (Y = a + bX) b-coefficient is positive. Increases in workload result in aconstant positive increase in manpower. 2.7.8.2.  The parabolic model (Y = a + bX + cX²) b-coefficient is positive, and the c-coefficient isnegative, and workload values do not exceed the point where X = -b/2c (apex). If the b and c con-ditions are met and workload is greater than -b/2c, increasing workload after the apex results indecreasing manpower and the model is not realistic. 2.7.8.3.  The power model (Y = aXb) a-coefficient is positive and b-coefficient is between zero andone. This restricts the model to an increasing function where Y increases more slowly as Xincreases. 2.7.8.4.  The ratio model [Y = X/(a + bX)] a-coefficient and b-coefficient are greater than zero. 2.7.9.  Figure 2.5. , Realistic and Economic Criteria, summarizes the preceding discussion. Figure 2.5.

Using Scattergrams. The most useful tool to analyze C&R computations is the scattergram. Thescattergram is merely an X-Y graph of the plotted input points. Develop a scattergram before or in con-junction with regression computations. Use this chart to graphically identify outliers that influence otherinput points. Figure 2.6. gives example data and associated scattergram for the calculations in the nextAFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 200385paragraph. Note that base "F" (sixth input point) represents an outlier and was not used in these computa-tions. Figure 2.6.  Example Data and Associated Scattergram.

General Calculations. Use of an automated statistical package (see note below) for computingregression equations will be acceptable. Manual computation procedures may also be used and are shownto illustrate the process and to aid interpretation of the results. Table 2.1. illustrates the computation pro-cess for regression coefficients with one dependent variable. Table 2.2. illustrates the computation pro-cess for the multivariate model with two independent variables and the parabolic model with oneindependent variable. These two models are combined in Table 2.2. because of their similarity of compu-tations. When doing manual computations, carry as many decimal places as possible and round only forthe final answer. When using one answer in further computations, for example, using "b" to compute "a,"use the unrounded value. NOTE: AFMIA does not advocate any particular automated statistical application.

Both the linear and parabolic equations explain a significant portion of the variance becauseeach equation passes the F-test. 2.10.3.  The squared term in the parabolic equation has a coefficient that is significantly different fromzero. It passes the t-test. 2.10.4.  The equations are also evaluated by the realistic and economic criteria. 2.10.4.1.  The linear equation passes both of these tests because it has a slope that is positive andconstant. 2.10.4.2.  The parabolic equation passes the first part of the realistic test because the "b" is greaterthan zero and "c" is negative. However, it fails the second part because the apex is within the datarange. 2.10.4.2.1.  The highest X-value for the input data points is 7.5. 2.10.4.2.2.  Apex =      2.10.4.2.3.  Since 6.348 is less than 7.5, the parabolic equation should not be used. A specialequation form such as the ratio or power curve may fit better in this case. 2.11.  Calculations for the Special Equation Forms.  2.11.1.  Power Curve. When the general equation Y = aXb is transformed using logarithms, it becomeslog Y = log a + b(log X). These transformed values can then be used in the general formulas for linearregression to find a and b. This procedure only gives an approximation of the true a and b values.Using these transformed values in the general equation for R² can yield negative values for R², that aretheoretically impossible since R² must range between zero and one. A better estimate of these coeffi-cients (a and b) is obtained by computing these coefficients through an iterative process using Taylor'sseries approximations. Once these new coefficients have been found, they can be used in the generalformula for R². This procedure gives an unbiased estimate of a and b and reduces the occurrence ofnegative R² values. Further discussion of the iteration process for transformed linear models can befound in Neter, Applied Linear and Statistical Models. 2.11.2.  Ratio Curve. When the general equation Y = X/(a + bX) is transformed, it becomes X/Y = a +bX. The transformed values (X/Y ratios) can be used in the general formula for linear regression inlieu of Y-values as was done with the power curve. 2.12.  Calculations for Multivariate Models. Calculations for multivariate models having more thantwo independent variables are generally done with computers and are beyond the scope of this publica-tion. 2.13.  Rounding Procedures.  2.13.1.  As a general rule, do all computations using the capability of your computing device. Forexample, if that device is a calculator with seven-decimal capability, then use seven decimals. Roundonly the final result to the number of decimal places shown in Table 2.3.. AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 200395Table 2.3.  Rounding Rules. A R U L E  If the number to be rounded is 1 reported man-hour values 2  average workload values 3 4 leveling factor statistical measure such as: accuracy, mean and standard deviation, standard error of the estimate, coefficient of determination, coefficient of variation, or test statistics (F&t) functional estimating equation,percentage factors fractional manpower values 5 6 7  coefficients for manpower models (including regression equations, single location equations, simulation equations, etc.) B then round it to 2 decimal places 2 decimal places 2 decimal places 3 decimal places 3 decimal places 3 decimal places at least 4 significant digits. For example, 1.352 or 0.53322 2.13.2.  Once the number of decimal places is decided, discard all of the digits to the right of thatpoint. Do not change any digits to the left of that point. Round the last digit to be kept up only if thedigit to the right of it is greater than or equal to 5. Examples of rounding numbers to three decimalplaces are: 2.13.2.1.  27.16346...becomes 27.163 because 4 is less than 5. 2.13.2.2.  31.39461...becomes 31.395 because 6 is greater than 5. 2.13.2.3.  16.48450...becomes 16.485 because 5 is equal to 5. Section 2B—Analysis and Adjustments 2.14.  General Concepts. Variations in data can be expected even in the most carefully designed study.However, some variation may be due to levels of service or poor measurement. Regardless of the reasons,the data must be analyzed to make sure required work is done at an acceptable level. This sectiondescribes procedures for doing data analysis and adjustments. 2.15.  Data Correction and Data Adjustment Differences. Although data corrections and data adjust-ments are similar, there is a distinct difference. 2.15.1.  Data Corrections. Make mathematical corrections before doing C&R. Corrections consist ofadministrative errors such as incorrectly transcribing the data, using improper frequencies, or not fol-lowing measurement instructions in the measurement plan. Corrections also consist of computationalerrors. Most corrections have relatively minor impact on measured man-hours and do not need coor-dination with the functional OPR. Audit trails of all corrections, including computational errors androunding differences, are kept in the study team's backup files but are not documented in the finalreport. 96AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 20032.15.2.  Data Adjustments. Make data adjustments only after investigation has identified the reasonfor extreme data and the need for adjustment. The lead study craftsman makes adjustments to normal-ize the level of service only when the senior functional manager concurs with the adjustment. Docu-ment adjustments in the final report and keep an audit trail for adjustments in the final report backupdata file. Do not make adjustments solely to improve statistics. 2.16.  Study Team Responsibilities.  2.16.1.  Do a 100% math check of all input computations. For computerized products, make sure thatnumerical data have been transferred into your statistical package correctly. 2.16.2.  Check each input for consistency. 2.16.3.  Investigate the representativeness of reported work counts. 2.16.4.  Check work center comments. 2.16.5.  Keep a record of all significant information and rationale used to analyze the input data. 2.16.6.  Document all mathematical corrections on the forms. 2.16.7.  Make sure that adjustments are based on sound logic and expert opinions. 2.17.  Statistical Analysis. (See Statistical Tables at Attachment 2 for R2 and V criteria.) 2.17.1.  Use your statistical package (see Note below) and this section to begin data analysis. 2.17.2.  Set up your initial C&R data using man-hours for the Y-variable. For the X-variable, use onlylogical and acceptable potential WLF values. For example, "hospital beds" may be logical, but if allinput locations don't have hospital beds, then the WLF is not acceptable. 2.17.3.  Run initial multivariate C&R and detail based on one standard error. Many inferences can bemade from this first run. For example, does the work center display standardization? Is the data statis-tically acceptable with minor adjustments? Which bases are exerting the most influence on the data?Follow this chronological sequence. 2.17.3.1.  Assume the first C&R run with five potential WLFs yields the statistics and detailshown in Figure 2.8.. NOTE: The more substantive statistical packages produce the Table of R Values and Order of EntryStatistics. The new MSDS C&R module incorporates these statistics and will operate in Windows as anExcel add-on. AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 200397Figure 2.8.  Initial Multivariate C&R Analysis.

The objective of initial analysis is to find an acceptable equation using minimum vari-ables. Does an acceptable equation exist with one or a combination of the five independent vari-ables in Figure 2.8.? The answer is, "probably yes." Inspection of the Table of r-values shows that. only one WLF (X) passes the criteria for a bivariate relationship. This criteria is .7071 or 98AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 20032.17.3.3.  Run a bivariate C&R analysis using the WLF that had the highest r-value greater than.7071. If no r-values are higher than .7071, do not waste time running bivariate analysis - theimprovement between bivariate models is insignificant at this point. In Figure 2.8., the WLF forX5 against Y has an r-value of .7135; however, the bivariate relationship for this WLF does notyield a desired v-value. 2.17.3.4.  Pay particular attention to the order of entry (see Figure 2.8.). The multivariate programis based on stepwise regression analysis. This means that the first X entered into the equation (X5)is the one with the highest R. The second X entered into the equation (X3) is the one that, in com-bination with the one already entered, improves the equation the most, and so on. The next run totry would be multivariate with Y versus X5 and X3 (see Figure 2.9.). Although this run is signif-icantly better than the bivariate run (not shown), the v-value is still greater than the desired maxi-mum .250. AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 200399Figure 2.9.

As a result of the analysis this far, we know: 2.17.3.8.1.  With only minor adjustments, satisfactory statistics can be achieved. 102AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 20032.17.3.8.2.  The most suspect point for questioning of input data is base number 4, that is out-side one Syx by 23.312 man-hours. 2.17.3.9.  The next step is to do C&R at the next lower level; that is, use direct rather than totalman-hours against workload. The purpose of this analysis is to identify outliers only. 2.17.3.10.  After this step, continue with ratio analysis. First, use the ratio of direct-to-indirect timeat each location. This analysis may be done with the work unit time standard routine or ahand-held calculator. Second, use ratio analysis for process times and work units. 2.17.4.  At this stage in data analysis, you should know what data needs questioning and investigatingand the process that needs further analysis. 2.17.4.1.  When process level analysis shows problems with the data, do a more detailed step anal-ysis. Step analysis of operational audit data can help with identifying extreme values that affectprocess results. Even if initial C&R is acceptable, you should still do analysis at the process levelfor OA studies. Do this to verify that there is no erroneous data hidden by the wash effect of over-all C&R. 2.17.4.2.  Consider data outside two standard errors (two standard deviations if using work unittimes) as candidates for investigation and possible adjustment. This assumes all administrativeand logic data corrections have already been made to the data base. 2.17.4.3.  Making proper data adjustments can be quite difficult and controversial. Therefore, youneed a high degree of coordination and documentation. Although statistical procedures are used toidentify adjustment candidates, failing statistical accuracy is not an acceptable reason for adjustingdata. When there is a logical cause for the dispersion, the data point will be considered either rep-resentative or not representative. If representative, include the data point in the final equationdevelopment. If not representative, consider it for variance development. Normalize extremeswhen they are abnormal and illogical, but do not adjust the data when extreme values occur for avalid reason. Do logic analysis as follows: 2.17.4.3.1.  Compare per accomplishment times (PATs) and activity frequencies (FREQs) tobenchmark times or frequency reports. 2.17.4.3.2.  Question the reasons for the high or low PATs and FREQs (for example, lowskilled personnel or recent transfers). 2.17.4.3.3.  Check for any patterns in the data (for example, high data for an entire input base). 2.17.4.3.4.  Evaluate the effect of the Statement of Conditions (SOC) on the PATs and FREQs. 2.17.4.3.5.  Solicit the input craftsman's opinion of the data and particular problems encoun-tered during measurement. Request clarification or re-measurement, if needed. 2.17.4.3.6.  Solicit the functional OPR’s opinion of the measured data. Request help in clarify-ing controversial issues. For example: Identifying a step being done in a variety of ways in thefield, thereby causing extreme values in the collected data, is a difficult problem. Staff thisproblem with the functional OPR to make sure the correct level of service is included in thestandard. 2.17.4.3.7.  Coordinate all adjustments. 2.17.4.3.8.  Record all data adjustments in Part Three of the final report. AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 20031032.17.4.4.  Adjust data as follows: 2.17.4.4.1.  Develop an acceptable data range for PATs or work unit times based on study teamevaluation of measurement data. Once developed, this data range should be explained andcoordinated with the OPR. Adjust unexplainable data points above this range to the upper limitof the range and adjust unexplainable data points below the range to the lower limit of therange. 2.17.4.4.2.  As a benchmark, make sure the sum of all data adjustments (excluding administra-tive corrections) does not exceed five percent of the measured man-hours for the study total. Ifadjustments exceed the five percent threshold, informally coordinate recommended dataadjustments. 2.17.4.4.3.  The study team saves the data used to develop the final equation. This data can besaved on computer disks or a copy of the measurement report can be placed in the data files. 2.18.  Initiative or Option Measurement Data. All initiatives or options not included in the studyshould be documented and included as an attachment to the final report. Pay careful attention to make surethat each item is documented so that it may be incorporated into the standard at a later date. Make surethat enough data is available to change the standard once senior management approves the inclusion of theinitiative or option. Section 2C—Extrapolation Limits 2.19.  General Concepts. Extrapolation is defined as extending the regression line beyond the range ofthe input data. Any extrapolation involves an element of statistical risk. However, to increase standards'utility, expand standards' applicability, and prevent rapid obsolescence due to workload changes, the MEPuses 25% above and below the largest and smallest Yc value. These limits represent the maximum amountan equation can be extended. They do not preclude the use of more limited extrapolation when the totalamount would be unrealistic. 2.20.  Factors Affecting Extrapolation.  2.20.1.  Several factors increase confidence in the extrapolation limits built into the standard. Thesefactors are low standard error, high number of input locations, even distribution of WLF volumes, andabsence of extreme values. 2.20.2.  An equation that represents a sharp curve near the low or high end of the input data range oran equation that has rapidly leveling slopes may not allow the full 25% extrapolation. 2.20.3.  Statistical procedures, however complex and exacting, are not a substitute for analysis of datapoints falling in the extended range of applicability. Regardless of the method used in computing thisrange, logical considerations must also be looked at when the standard is extended. 2.21.  Computation of Extrapolation Limits. Use the steps in Table 2.4., Table 2.5., and Table 2.6. tocompute the selected equations extrapolation limits. See Figure 2.12., Figure 2.13., and Figure 2.14. forthe data base and graph for these models. Carry four or more decimal places during computations, thenround the final answer to two decimal places. Insert the statistical printout in the final report to showextrapolation limits. 104AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003Table 2.4.  Computation of Extrapolation Limits for Linear Equations.

Special Consideration in Extrapolation.  2.22.1.  Lower Extrapolation Limit. For bivariate linear equations, parabolic equations, and multivari-ate equations with positive coefficients, the lower extrapolation limit must be greater than or equal tothe a-value in the equation. 2.22.2.  Multivariate Equations. The extrapolation limits for multivariate equations are based on pre-dicted man-hours only (Yu and Yl from steps 2 and 3 of Table 2.4.). AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 20031112.22.3.  Single Location Standards. Extrapolation for a single location standard is based on ±25% ofthe calculated man-hours. Hence, the limits are Yl = .75Yc and Yu = 1.25Yc. Note that in single loca-tion standards, the measures Y, Yc, and Y-bar should be approximately equal. 2.22.4.  Modular Equations. To find the extrapolation limits for modular equations, compute the limitsfor each module as outlined in paragraph 2.21. and Table 2.4., Table 2.5., orTable 2.6.. 2.22.5.  Power Model. Follow the procedures for a linear equation. No special considerations areneeded. 2.22.6.  Special Calculation Procedures for Computing Workload Data Range. The two models thatneed an upper workload value to be stated are: 2.22.6.1.  Parabolic model. Because the equation for this model starts to decrease after the apexvalue, there will be some large workload values that yield man-hours within the acceptable extrap-olation range that are unusable. To illustrate, refer to the parabolic equation in 2.14.. A workloadfactor value of 350, when substituted in the parabolic equation yields 1271.11 man-hours -1271.11 man-hours is in the acceptable extrapolation range, but it is on the decreasing segment ofthe curve. The formula for computing the upper workload data range for a parabolic model is inTable 2.6.. 2.22.6.2.  Hyperbolic (ratio) model. Because the equation for this model approaches, but nevercrosses, an asymptote, workload can increase endlessly (after a certain point) and never yield anyadditional man-hours. The formula for computing the upper workload data range for a hyperbolicmodel is in Table 2.5.. 2.23.  Use of Extrapolation Limits. After the extrapolation limits are computed, report them as the"Standard Applicability Man-Hour Range" on AF Form 1113, Standard Manpower Table. For thosestandards with more than one man-hour equation, record the standard applicability man-hour range foreach equation in Application Instructions of the AFMS. Always state this range in man-hours. Section 2D—Skill and Grade Determination 2.24.  General Concepts. The process of skill and grade determination converts total manpower standardrequirements into units of manpower with the skills and grades necessary to do the defined work centermission. Skill and grade determination must not be affected by external constraints or funding limitations.The minimum essential work center requirements must be engineered and documented independently ofresource availability. Other methods may be used, but the specific procedure and data source must be doc-umented in the manpower standard final report. 2.25.  Skill and Grade Determination without C&R.  2.25.1.  Step 1. Derive Total Man-Hours for Each Location. Total man-hours are derived by summingthe direct and indirect man-hours. 2.25.2.  Step 2. Compute Recommended Manpower Requirements for Each Location. Divide theman-hours in step 1 by the correct man-hour availability factor (MAF) and overload factor (militaryMAF, if work center is mixed). For example, 663.60 / (151.5 x 1.077) = 4.067. Round the resultingfractional manpower requirement to the correct whole manpower requirement IAW AFI 38-201. 112   AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 20032.25.3.  Step 3. Estimate Required Grades and Skills for Each Location. The input craftsman consultswith the work center supervisor and local OPR to get a proposed distribution. Record the recom-mended distribution as directed by the study team. For example,      AFSC(1)              AFSC(2)       AFSC(3) 9    7    5    3           9   7   5   3           CG 1MSG    1SSG       1TSG 1SSG        1CPT 2.25.4.  Step 4. Determine Grades and Skills for AF Form 1113. The study team checks input recom-mendations and rationale, averages the input team recommendations for each level on the manpowertable, and completes the table. The study team reconciles any grade inversion on the manpower table.For example, the number for a particular grade and skill should not decrease when compared to theprevious column on the manpower table. 2.25.5.  Step 5. Coordinate Proposed Grade and Skill Distribution. The study team coordinates themanpower table with the OPR as part of the final report. 2.26.  Skill and Grade Determination with C&R.  2.26.1.  Study Planning. During this phase of standards development, the study team and the func-tional OPR predetermine the Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs) based on steps shown in the processoriented description (POD). Skill distribution is also decided and shown as a percentage of each step.Study teams: 2.26.1.1.  Investigate manpower currently used in the work center including current authorizedand assigned military and DoD civilian strengths along with their respective grades and skills byMAJCOM, by base. The Manpower Data System (MDS) is a source for military and civilianauthorizations while local base products will give assigned strength data. 2.26.1.2.  Check corresponding Air Force Specialty (AFS) descriptions in AFMANs 36-2105,Officer Classification, and 36-2108, Airman Classification, and specialty training standards(STSs). 2.26.1.3.  Identify steps that, by directive, need to be done by a specific AFS, skill level, or grade. 2.26.1.4.  Analyze the POD and, based on research and interviews with the functional OPR, iden-tify the AFSC needed to do the step. 2.26.1.4.1.  The concept that workers spend most of their work time performing at their high-est skill level governs what skills are needed. Identifying and distributing skills catalogs thetotal manpower requirement into the proper types and qualifications of workers. 2.26.1.4.2.  Give particular attention to picking the proper category of manpower require-ments. Make sure that rated specialties are needed only when the duties involved clearly jus-tify such action. It is Air Force policy to use senior noncommissioned officers in lieu of lowerAFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003113grade commissioned officers when practical and feasible. Officer requirements must be justi-fied by responsibilities or duties specifically needing an officer. 2.26.1.5.  Document the skill percentage requirement in matrix format for each step as displayedin Figure 2.15.. Note that some steps can be done entirely by a given AFSC while the varyingcomplexity of others may need more experience. Show officer requirements in the company gradeor field grade category. Show colonel (0-6) requirements separately. Figure 2.15.  AFSC Percent Distribution. 9 40 10 10 AFS AAAXX 7 5 80 60 60 30 40 Process/ Step 1.1. 1.2. 1.3. 2. 3.1. 3.2. 3.3.

During this activity of standards development, the studyteam analyzes recommended AFSCs sent by the input teams and, along with the OPR, decides thegrade requirements. Use these analysis procedures. 2.26.3.1.  Record the recommended fractional manpower for each base on a separate chart for eachAFS. For example, the recommended fractional manpower for AFS BBBXX from Base A (Figure2.16.) is recorded as the first line of Figure 2.17.

A scattergram aids in spotting any obviousAFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003117inconsistencies in recommended skills. If there are inconsistencies, they may be explained in theinput team's comments. If not, talk to the input team to determine the rationale for their recom-mendations. Adjust specialty and skill distribution percentage data, as needed. Document the rea-son for adjustment. Figure 2.19.  Fractional Manpower & Skill Level Scattergram. 2.26.3.3.  Fit a regression line to the data for each AFSC (see Figure 2.18.). This aids both in sta-tistically identifying the best skill level model and in picking the phase points for increasing themanpower for each AFSC. 2.26.3.4.  Study the data array and the scattergram to find the man-hour values when there are sig-nificant changes (any amount of additional manpower) in either specialty or skill requirements.The incremental changes can be found by working each equation for the desired manpower value.Some examples of these are: the point that an officer requirement first takes place; the point that astaff-officer AFSC is first needed; similar points for 3, 5, 7, or 9-skill level requirements; and thepoint that multiple requirements for any of the foregoing first occur. 2.27.  Procedures for Grade Requirements.  2.27.1.  The study team, jointly with the OPR, analyzes the resulting manpower skill level distributionto set grade requirements. These considerations are addressed by the study team before setting graderequirements. 2.27.1.1.  Read AFI 36-2618, Enlisted Force Structure, and AFI 36-2611, Officer ProfessionalDevelopment Guide, to get an understanding of the particular AFSs and their relationships withinthe functional area under study. Also read AFD 36-14, Position Management and Classification,for treatment of civilian positions. 2.27.1.2.  Check the need to keep career field experience. The effect of promotion opportunitieswithin each skill level should be checked to reduce the experience loss caused by retraining fromone career field to another. In an ideal situation, these grade percentages exists for each skill level. 118AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003 9-level: 33% CMSgt and 67% SMSgt  7-level: 40% MSgt and 60% TSgt  5-level: 50% SSgt and 50% SrA Also, look at the latest profile for the entire career progression group. Base a decision to signifi-cantly deviate from the profile on specific needs of the work center as projected to the total popu-lation of the Air Force specialty. NOTE: Both CMSgt and SMSgt grades are identified with the 9-skill level for purposes of grade distri-bution percentage. However, the CMSgt grade is reported with a chief enlisted manager (CEM) AFSCXXX00. 2.27.1.3.  Analyze the current usage of personnel within the career field, and purge it of any math-ematical errors. This is a separate and distinct process from analysis and adjustment covered inSection 2B. The end result of C&R is only as good as the data it's based on. 2.27.2.  Identify the steps within an AFSC in a relative order as to experience and ability needed, interms of grades. 2.27.3.  Find those points in each step list where the transition is made from one grade to another.Assume the lowest grade specified for each AFSC is needed to do the lowest ranking step identifiedon that AFSC's step list. 2.27.4.  Using the lowest ranking step for each AFSC as a point of departure, estimate the amount oftime needed in the functional area to get the necessary experience to satisfactorily do the succeedinghigher-ranking steps. Base these estimates on the anticipated experience of an average individual pro-gressing through a typical technical education, on-the-job training, and career progression pattern. 2.27.5.  Check each list with the measurement data to find the man-hours spent at the different levelsof step difficulty. 2.27.6.  Check the working relationship between the work center and other agencies. The scope andsensitivity of these interfaces may need some degree of grade comparability between working coun-terparts. Evaluate input team grade comments that may influence the grade requirement. 2.28.  AFSC and Grade Documentation.  2.28.1.  Compute and document the AFSC and grade distributions needed for varying manpowertotals on an AF Form 1113. 2.28.2.  Use each AFS equation resulting from regression analysis to compute the total personnelneeded for each skill level. 2.28.2.1.  The independent variable in each equation (X value) is the incremental manpowerrequirement (4, 5,...9, etc.). AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 20031192.28.2.2.  Thus, to compute the manpower distribution for a total of nine spaces, using the skilllevel equations in Figure 2.18..    Y9 = -1.244 + 0.4297(9) - 0.01(9)²    Y9 = 1.813 or 2 9-levels    Y7 = 0.2709 + 0.1873(9)    Y7 = 1.957 or 2 7-levels    Y5 = 0.4074 + 0.3251(9)    Y5 = 3.333 or 3 5-levels    Y3 = -0.1639 + 0.2838(9)    Y3 = 2.390 or 2 3-levels 2.28.3.  Due to rounding, strict use of the fractional manpower breakpoints may yield more or lessthan the total work center requirement (X-value). Together, the study team and functional OPR findthe correct rounding point that maintains the total requirement. 120AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003Chapter 3 CORE MODELING 3.1.  General Concepts.  3.1.1.  Core modeling is a study technique designed to capture common core workload and relatedmanpower requirements for a particular function. The process still allows for differences (variances)caused by mission, technological, or environmental factors. In the past, it was difficult to obtain ourcustomer's or functional OPR's concurrence because of the uncertainty of whether or not credit wasgiven for all work (including unique or peculiar situations) done by the function. Core modeling maybe used with almost any measurement method, except work sampling. It is particularly suited to work-shop measurement when using flow procedures charting, operational audit, and staffing pattern meth-ods to determine requirements. For our purposes, core workload is the most important part of a workcenter's or function's workload that must be completed to accomplish the mission. 3.1.2.  A depiction of core modeling would be: 3.1.2.1.  Functional core man-hours with variance man-hours for individual differences. The totalman-hours are then used to determine total work center man-hours. 3.1.2.2.  Then, total work center man-hours are divided by the man-hour availability factor (MAF)to find the total work center requirements. 3.2.  Specific Procedures. The procedures for developing a core modeling manpower standard are basi-cally the same steps as any other standard, but the sequence of the operations are different. The steps areas follows: 3.2.1.  Develop the core POD identifying only minimum requirements necessary to perform the workcenter's mission. This should be a coordinated effort between the functional and manpower communi-ties, and all customers should give full participation. 3.2.2.  Verify the POD and obtain approval of the core POD with all customers. Also request that theystart identifying their differences (variances) and unique situations that are not included in the corePOD, but essential to mission completion. Keep in mind, that variances are only for environmental,technological, or mission differences, not for nice-to-have programs, indirect work, additional duties,etc. 3.2.3.  The study team develops and measures the core model. Use whatever measurement method ismost conducive for the function. 3.2.4.  The study team prepares a final report with only the core model equations identified, andrequests that the customers identify and quantify their variance requirements. The manpower commu-nity normally quantifies the variances, as well as prices out the core model. Core man-hours and vari-ance man-hours are used to find total work center requirements. The total package, includingcomments is sent to the study team. 3.2.5.  The study team and the Senior Functional Manager review and analyze each variance to deter-mine its validity. See AFMAN 38-208, Volume 1, paragraph 3.27 for processing variances. AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 20031213.2.6.  The study team determines the overall impact of the manpower standard, provides feedback toall customers relative to their variance disposition, revises the final report if necessary, and briefs thetotal estimated impact. 3.2.7.  The MAJCOM Manpower and Organization Directorate submits the core model and variancesto AFMIA to be published as the manpower standard. 3.3.  Benefits of Core Modeling.  3.3.1.  One benefit of using the core modeling technique is that our functional OPRs or customersview this type of technique as "fair and equitable" because their unique workloads have beenaddressed as part of the formal study process. 3.3.2.  Another benefit of using this technique is that the study isn't "bogged down" during data anal-ysis, trying to address outlying data points and individual base concerns. This normally reduces theoverall study time. 3.3.3.  Core Modeling gives our functional managers or customers a tool to decide what level of ser-vice they can afford. 3.3.4.  This study technique is particularly useful in nonstandardized functions where mode of opera-tions differ, in functions with undefined levels of service, or in work centers where previous tries todevelop manpower standards proved unsuccessful. Examples would be Budget, Cost Analysis, andOperational Contracting. 3.4.  Disadvantages of Core Modeling. The major disadvantage of core modeling is the additionalworkload taskings on the manpower community to collect and quantify the variance workload in thebeginning. This can be alleviated if the manpower and functional communities are involved in the studyprocess from the beginning, are briefed on what has been captured as core workload, and are briefed onwhat needs to be identified as variance workload. This allows them to get a head start on the process, andeliminates potential misunderstandings and confusion. 122AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003Chapter 4 FLOW PROCEDURES (FP) CHARTING 4.1.  General Concepts.  4.1.1.  In the past, obtaining concurrence on measurement data was difficult due to functional OPRuncertainty that the level of detail of the measurement included all work being accomplished in thework center. FP charting displays a level of detail so specific that our customer or functional managercan determine what work is being performed, who's doing the work, how much time a process takes toperform, and where the delays in the process take place. This chapter provides an overview of the FPcharting process and its use within the manpower or functional community. 4.1.2.  FP charting may be used in practically any work center, but is particularly suited to process-ori-ented work centers. A process is a series of actions that bring about an end or result. For our purposes,a process is a procedure with a definitive input and output product. Examples would be: TDY travelvouchers, supply requisitions, contract orders, etc. 4.1.3.  FP charting is especially helpful in areas where extremely long work cycles would precludework sampling. 4.1.4.  If the study team is unable to get acceptable statistics from the measurement data, FP chartingprovides an alternate course of action. Since the data is already aligned procedurally, "b" coefficientsare easily developed. 4.2.  Benefits of FP Charting.  4.2.1.  The FP charting method is a good starting point for a most effective organization study. It pro-vides a tool allowing both the functional customer and manpower community to depict and analyze awork center under the current mode of operation, identify problems and improve the current opera-tion, and adopt an MEO. It also provides a performance measures tool that the function can use tomonitor internal performance. 4.2.2.  FP charting segregates technical, administrative, and supervisory duties within the measure-ment data. This is particularly helpful in the development of the skills and grades matrix. 4.2.3.  Standard maintenance is greatly simplified. Because of the measurement detail provided in FPcharts, changes to existing procedures are easily identified and quantified. 4.2.4.  FP charts can be used as forecasting tools to price out or determine the manpower impact ofpolicy changes levied on a work center in advance. 4.3.  Specific Characteristics. As with the OA method of measurement, FP charting uses activity timevalues at the process, step, or even beyond to obtain measured man-hours. The primary differencebetween OA measurement and FP charting is in the arraying of the measurement data. Some of the simi-larities and differences are outlined as follows: 4.3.1.  Measurement Data. FP charting arrays data both vertically and horizontally. Each procedureidentified has its own set of charts. A procedure may begin at whatever level of detail the studyrequires. Break each step down to the level the study team has determined will provide the best mea-surement data. AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 20031234.3.2.  Per Accomplishment Time (PAT) Data. Obtain PAT data using the same procedures outlined inthe chapter for operational audit (Chapter 9). 4.3.3.  Frequency data. Although frequency data may be obtained using the same methods as OA mea-surement, that is where the similarity ends. By aligning the work center steps procedurally, only a sin-gle frequency count (excluding conditional factors) needs to be collected for each procedure charted. 4.3.4.  Conditional Factors. Conditional factors relate to frequencies of a step and are those parts of aprocedure that do not always occur with each repetition of a given work cycle or occur more than onceper repetition. In order to account for these factors within a procedure's total time, the percentage ofoccurrence of that factor must be computed. The percentage of occurrence is obtained by dividing thenumber of times a given factor occurred within a procedure by the number of times it could haveoccurred. For example, if the work center frequency is service contracts processed for the service con-tract procedure, and if the second step in the procedure only occurs with 1 out of every 10 contracts, apercentage of occurrence would be determined as follows: 1 divided by 10 = 10%. This percentage orfactor is then multiplied by the step time to obtain a constructed PAT. Thus, instead of giving full timefor this step for only the cycles in which it would occur (something that might be difficult to measure),partial time is provided for the step in every cycle. This allows for a constructed time to be developedfor even the most difficult or lengthy procedures. Also, as most conditional factors will be associatedwith rework, they clearly identify to functional management the areas on which to focus qualityimprovement efforts. 4.3.5.  Format. AF Form 3576, Flow/Procedures Chart, are designed based on the needs of eachstudy. Charts will have a basic format for processes that are one page or chart and an extension formatfor processes that are over one page or chart. All processes should begin with the basic format chart.The following are specific chart characteristics: 4.3.5.1.  The page number of the chart should be identified in the top right hand corner. 4.3.5.2.  The upper left corner is general information about the procedure and should be completedby the study team or study manager. 4.3.5.3.  In the upper right corner are the chart symbols. See Figure 1.3. for symbol definitions. 4.3.5.4.  Next, determine how the positions or people involved in the procedure should be depictedon the chart. 4.3.5.5.  Use the extension sheet for a procedure over one page. 4.4.  Precharting Activities.  4.4.1.  The guidelines for developing an FP chart are relatively simple as the technique provides max-imum flexibility in allowing the study team to express its measurement needs concisely to the inputlocations in the field. 4.4.2.  The first step in chart development is to become very familiar with the work center and to drafta step-by-step word description for those steps in the POD that are being considered for FP measure-ment. The study team must make sure that they fully understand the real procedures of the work cen-ter, as well as the respective input and output documents. 4.4.3.  The word description should depict the actions of work center personnel as they interact withthe product or process being charted. 124AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 20034.4.4.  As with other measurement methods, each step should have easily recognizable beginning andending points for ease of measurement. 4.4.5.  Flow process chart items can be broken up into three types. 4.4.5.1.  Measurable Items. These are the steps in the procedure that will require measurement.Identify the type of method to be used in quantifying this step by using an alpha character belowthe step number. When choosing alpha characters to designate the measurement method, use theletter code shown in Table 9.1., Box 5H. 4.4.5.2.  Nonmeasurable Items. Nonmeasurable items are steps that do not expend work centerman-hours but are charted in order to maintain process continuity. Some examples of nonmeasur-able items are origination and gap symbols. Another example would be when a measurable step isreferenced elsewhere in another set of charts. This occurs when certain steps cross proceduralboundaries. If this is the case and a separate work count for each procedure cannot be obtained,then develop another set of charts for each of the affected procedures. Since the man-hours for thatstep are accounted for elsewhere, this step becomes nonmeasurable in that procedure. 4.4.5.3.  Informational Items. The only items on an FP chart that do not have step numbers or sym-bols are informational items. These items are placed on the charts to clarify certain procedures orsupply specific information designed to aid the input craftsman during measurement. Besides thenormal step descriptions, informational items supply an additional avenue for the study team todescribe occurrences in the process that may not otherwise be evident. This provides the inputcraftsman with a greater understanding of the procedure and what the measurement needs are. 4.4.6.  Once the word description has been finalized, the work must then be broken out by position.Although the manner in which work center positions are broken out depends on the study team, themost common type of breakout is by craftsman, administration, and supervisor. Dividing the workloadalong these lines allows the study team to determine the impact of administrative and supervisory per-sonnel on direct workload. Further breaking out the craftsman process by skill level provides for anal-ysis of craftsman grade structures as well. 4.4.7.  Once the position breakout has been done, procedures steps within those positions have beencategorized, and process symbols have been assigned, the draft charts are then prepared. 4.5.  FP Chart Preparation.  4.5.1.  The following steps are required to prepare a FP chart: 4.5.1.1.  Determine the procedure to be charted and its input and output documents. 4.5.1.2.  Determine how many people are involved in the process, the type of work they do, andinteractions among personnel. 4.5.1.3.  Select the appropriate chart format in terms of the number of people needed in the pro-cess. 4.5.1.4.  Complete the top left portion of the chart and fill in column headings for required person-nel. 4.5.1.5.  Start the process with an origination symbol under the appropriate column where the doc-ument will be received. AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 20031254.5.1.6.  Select a symbol to depict the next step or action taken in the procedure. Each symbolshould be accompanied with a brief narrative statement. 4.5.1.7.  Continue to identify and depict each step with a symbol and narrative. For all measurablesteps, the narrative statement should match the narrative on the POD. Only measurable steps willbe identified on the POD; however, all measurable and nonmeasurable steps should have a stepnumber. 4.5.1.8.  Make sure that all steps in the process are captured from start to finish. 4.5.1.9.  After all procedures in the work center have been captured, get together with the func-tional manager or other team members and review and analyze the current procedures. Your majorobjective is to determine where inefficiencies exist in the current mode of operation. The func-tional manager can be of tremendous help while doing this analysis. You should look at ways ofchanging the procedure by reducing variation and step complexity. Things to consider are: multi-ple review levels, rework, scrap, avoidable delays, and nonvalue added steps. 4.5.1.10.  After the procedure charts have been improved and streamlined, make the necessarychanges and redo the charts. After the charts have been updated, go back and update the POD toreflect the new improved mode of operation. 4.5.1.11.  Begin measurement. Measure only the steps with an alpha character below the step num-ber. The study team should decide the best type of measurement for each step. The alpha charac-ters should show the type of OA measurement used. Place the measured time in the standard time(ST) block of the form. If a delay is involved in the task, include the time in the delay time (DT)column of the form. NOTE: Delay time does not always add measurable man-hours to a process,but is important to consider for process improvement. 4.5.1.12.  Identify steps that have conditional factors. These are measurable steps that do not occurin every cycle. Compute as follows: OriginalPATxPercent of OccurrenceAdjustment  = Adjusted PAT Example:     100 minutes      x        .10            =   10 minutes 4.5.1.13.  After measurement has been completed, always re-check your frequency source ofcount and accuracy. 4.5.1.14.  Add the total step times for the process and transfer this total to the upper left corner ofthe first page of the FP charts. 4.5.2.  You do not have to follow these steps exactly to successfully complete a FP chart. The type ofwork center under study will determine if you can consolidate or eliminate certain steps. 4.6.  MEO Development Using FP Charting.  126AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 20034.6.1.  Work center MEOs can be developed very easily using FP charting because the work is brokendown into small steps by person. This is done by first completing FP charts for each procedure or pro-cess within a work center under its current mode of operation. The main objective is to have a visualdisplay of all work being performed by work center personnel. Remember that before you canimprove or manage a process, you have to understand the process. Array the data for easy analysis.Now, the functional manager and study team should start reviewing and analyzing the data from anorganizational standpoint. Examples of this type of analysis include the following: 4.6.1.1.  Why do separate branches perform the same type of work? 4.6.1.2.  Is there duplication of effort among branches? 4.6.1.3.  What are individual branch missions? Does the work performed support their mission? 4.6.1.4.  Who are external and internal customers? 4.6.1.5.  Are there excessive branch-level reviews on products or services with no realvalue-added? 4.6.1.6.  What is the cost of operating each branch versus the real benefits received? 4.6.1.7.  Have volume of work, equipment, and physical layout been considered? 4.6.2.  After this analysis is completed, any organizational inefficiencies should be apparent. With thehelp of the functional manager, determine the best way to modify the structure to be more responsiveto the customer. After changes to the organizational structure have been recommended and approved,implement the new organizational structure. This will be the organizational structure used for measur-ing the function. Any changes should be made to the POD as well as the individual FP charts. 4.6.3.  Next, go through each process or procedure from a step standpoint and look at ways of chang-ing the process by reducing variation and step complexity. For each step in the process, consider thefollowing: 4.6.3.1.  Why is it being performed? 4.6.3.2.  What value does it add to the overall product? 4.6.3.3.  Why is this person doing it? 4.6.3.4.  Who should be doing it? 4.6.3.5.  Are conditional factors built for rework or errors and does management know what theerror rate is? 4.6.3.6.  Why are errors taking place? 4.6.3.7.  At what stage in the process do most of the errors occur? 4.6.3.8.  Are too many people looking at the same document? 4.6.3.9.  Can certain steps be automated? 4.6.3.10.  Can certain steps be eliminated? 4.6.3.11.  What are the governing publications for each step? 4.6.3.12.  Can any steps be simplified? AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 20031274.6.4.  After analyzing each step, determine what the real problems are within the procedures and cor-rect them. Then redo the FP charts under the new or proposed mode of operation. This is in essenceyour MEO and should be documented as such. 4.7.  Manpower Standard Development Using FP Charting. You can develop a manpower standardusing FP charting in a manner very similar to the OA method of measurement. Two ways to do this are asfollows: 4.7.1.  Statistical manpower standards using correlation and regression (C&R) analysis are developedby transferring FP chart procedure times to an AF Form 1040, Operational Audit Data. The follow-ing steps should take place: 4.7.1.1.  Determine the total time that one complete procedure takes. This total time should belocated on the first page of the FP charts for each procedure. For example, the total time for Pro-cedure 2 (Processes Service Contract) is 300 man-hours. 4.7.1.2.  Normally, each separate procedure is a separate process of work, or separate step on thePOD. For example, Process 2 on the Operational Contracting POD is: Processes Service Contract.This is the same as Procedure 2. 4.7.1.3.  Then determine how many service contracts were processed or awarded per month for thelast 12 months. Let's assume we have an average of 10 service contracts awarded per month. 4.7.1.4.  Now, you would prepare an AF Form 1040 for each location, by completing the frequen-cies (10 per month), and PAT (300 man-hours), then computing total Process 2 man-hours (3000man-hours). Do this for each process to determine the total work center man-hours. 4.7.1.5.  At this point, regular C&R can be performed at the process level, step level, or for thetotal work center. 4.7.1.6.  Determine standard indirect allowed man-hours (SIAM) by using the SIAM data sheetspublished with AFMS 00AA. These man-hours can then be added to the man-hour equation fortotal work center requirements. 4.7.2.  Develop the "b" Coefficient. Functional modeling, as well as functional estimating equations,may also be used. If satisfactory statistics cannot be achieved with C&R analysis, simply use the aver-age total FP chart time (or total procedure time) as the "b" coefficient. An example is provided below. BASE     1        2       3         4       5         6        7    AVERAGE Pros 2  PATs    315    320    280     275     290    305    300    297.86 Equation format:  Y = 297.86X2 (add SIAM man-hours) 4.7.3.  The other phases of the Manpower Standard Process remain the same. 128AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 20034.8.  Skill and Grade Matrix Development Using FP Charting. By identifying workload by positionon the FP chart, you can determine the percentage of work performed by each position and specialty, thendevelop a skill and grade matrix. This is done by adding the total time per position from the FP chart fora procedure, and then determining the procedure's total impact on the work center. For example, the Oper-ational Contracting work center process 2 or procedure 2 would be presented as follows: 4.8.1.  Step 1. Time to process one Service Contract is 300 man-hours broken down by the followingpositions: POSITIONS              MAN-HOURS               PERCENT OF                                     PER PROCEDURE           PROCEDURE Craft/6C0S1                  200                                   67% Supervisor/64PQ             70                                   23% Admin/3A1S1                 30                                   10%                                          300                                 100% 4.8.2.  Step 2. Determine the overall man-hour impact that Procedure 2 has on the work center. Let'sassume that the work center measured a total of 5,000 monthly man-hours and Procedure 2 takes atotal of 3,000 monthly man-hours (10 service contracts awarded per month x 300 man-hours per con-tract). In this case, Procedure 2 impact on the overall work center man-hours would be: 3,000 dividedby 5,000 = 60%. 4.8.3.  Step 3. Now multiply Procedure 2 position percentages by its overall impact on the work centerpercentage to determine the overall percentage that should be allocated to each position. POSITIONS  PERCENT OFPROCEDUREPOD PERCENTIMPACTPERCENTALLOCATED6C0S1 64PQ 3A1S1 67% 23% 10% 60% 60%  60% 40% 14%  6% 4.8.4.  Step 4. Repeat this for each procedure in the work center that has been measured, making surethat the percents allocated account for 100% of the work center requirements. 4.8.5.  Step 5. There will be situations in which a position is comprised of 3, 5, and 7 level work. If thisoccurs, determine what percent is 3 level, 5 level, and 7 level prior to doing the calculations, andextrapolate this percent to the position percentages. 4.8.6.  Step 6. Consider officer grade ceilings and career progression factors when preparing the skilland grade matrix. AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 20031294.9.  Functional Measures Tracking. Work center performance can be measured using the FP charts asthe standard procedure and time to perform work center processes. Effectiveness and efficiency indicescan be developed to track and measure performance. For example, the standard time to process a servicecontract is 300 man-hours. Suppose the work center is taking 330 man-hours to process a service contract,exceeding the standard allowed time by 10% (30 divided by 300 = 10%). Management should investigatethis variance to determine the causes for exceeding the standard time. Reference the chapter on perfor-mance measures for specific details of how to develop performance indices. 130AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003Chapter 5 FUNCTIONAL ESTIMATING EQUATIONS (FEE) Section 5A—Forecasting Manpower Requirements 5.1.  General Concepts. The purpose of this chapter is to show how work center manpower standardsform the basis for FEEs and how they are built. These equations are quantitative tools designed to be usedat all organizational levels to forecast manpower requirements. FEEs are optional and are used to supple-ment other forecasting methods. 5.2.  Air Force Program Element Structure.  5.2.1.  Manpower management personnel build the quantitative tools (models) needed to develop themanpower programming part of the planning, programming, and budgeting system. To be effective,these models must parallel the DoD programming system embodied in the Air Force part of the FutureYears Defense Program (FYDP). 5.2.1.1.  The broadest and most basic structural element of the FYDP is the major force program.Major force programs (see Figure 5.1.) represent broad aggregations of smaller or specific mis-sions that are closely related. AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003131Figure 5.1.  Major Force Programs in the FYDP. MAJOR FORCE PROGRAMS (MFP) PROGRAM 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 TITLE Strategic Forces  General Purpose Forces  C3I and Space Airlift/Sealift  Guard and Reserve Forces  Research and Development  Central Supply and Maintenance  Training, Medical, and Other General Personnel Activities Administration and Associated Activities Support of Other Nations Special Operations Forces 5.2.1.2.  Each major force program is subdivided into more specific mission breakdowns calledprogram elements. 5.2.1.2.1.  Program elements represent a combination of manpower, equipment, and facilitiesthat constitute a military capability or support activity. They give full descriptions of the mis-sion and are the smallest program cost-collection unit that OSD requires DoD components tofurnish information on a regular basis. Program elements are used throughout DoD and theyidentify every type of organization. 5.2.1.2.2.  Each program element is identified by a program element code (PEC) consisting ofsix characters. The first character represents the Major Force Program. The first five charac-ters are always numeric (for example, 41896) except "a" used for MFP 10 and "b" used forMFP 11. The sixth is always alphabetic. At the DoD level, this sixth character identifies theDoD component (F means Air Force) (see Figure 5.2.). When used within the Air Force, thissixth character is replaced by other alphabetic characters (for example, 41896A, 41896B)132AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003other than F that is reserved for DoD use. This is done when it is necessary to shred-out theDoD PEC to account for resources at a lower level. Program element code shreds are estab-lished by HQ USAF/XPM. Figure 5.2.

Within a program element, there can be one or more functional groups. A functionalgroup is defined by the first two digits of a functional account code (FAC). For example, PEC27236A includes work centers in 11XX Administration, 15XX Comptroller, 16XX Personnel,2XXX Maintenance, and 46XX Services (see Figure 5.3.). AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003133Figure 5.3.  Relationship Between Major Force Program, Program Elements, and Functional Groups. 5.2.2.  To meet the objective of building manpower forecasting tools, a FEE is built for each func-tional group within each MAJCOM. Section 5B—Functional Estimating Equation Development 5.3.  Building a FEE.  5.3.1.  Each FEE is made up of two major parts. 5.3.1.1.  A mathematical equation showing the relationship between the function's total manpowerrequirement and a selected program estimating factor (PEF). All of the PEFs are variables that arespecifically programmed in the FYDP. The PEFs used to build FEEs are: 5.3.1.1.1.  Flying hours. 5.3.1.1.2.  Number of aircraft. 5.3.1.1.3.  Number of missiles. 5.3.1.1.4.  Students. 5.3.1.1.5.  Base population. 5.3.1.1.6.  Number of vehicles. 5.3.1.2.  Percentage factors that break a function's total manpower requirements into various PECsand manpower categories at MAJCOM, base, and work center levels. These percentage factorsidentify what part of a function's total manpower requirements, as shown by application of the134AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003mathematical equation, are in various PECs. There are also factors that further identify what partof a PEC's manpower requirements are in various manpower categories. These categories includeofficers, airmen, United States direct-hire civilians, foreign national direct-hire civilians, foreignnational indirect-hire civilians, nonchargeable civilians on UAF but not in FYDP, and contractmanpower equivalents (CME). 5.3.2.  Build at least one FEE for each functional area. Functional areas are defined by the first or firstand second digit of Air Force FACs (for example, 5XXX defines the medical functional area while41XX defines the supply functional area). However, if manpower resources need to be programmed ata lower functional level (for example, 44EX), then build FEEs at these levels. 5.3.3.  Normally use regression analysis to build the mathematical equation of a FEE. This analysisuses the function's total required manpower and actual historical values for selected program estimat-ing factors from each relevant location in the MAJCOM. 5.3.3.1.  Make sure all mathematical equations are linear (bivariate or multivariate). 5.3.3.2.  Get the function's required manpower total at each location by applying all manpowerstandards that cover work centers in the function (use whole numbers for the manpower values). 5.3.3.2.1.  The monthly WLF values used in these applications are the result of analysis doneon the 12 most current months of historical data. If 12 months of data is not available, use 6months of data at the minimum. 5.3.3.2.2.  Include in the function's total manpower requirements any CMEs that are relevant.Track these numbers separately on the Unit Manpower Document (UMD). They will eventu-ally be identified as a CME percentage factor. 5.3.3.3.  Use PEFs in FEEs like WLFs are used in work center manpower standards. PEF valuesare average monthly values obtained from analysis of historical data for each location in the MAJ-COM. Take this historical data from the same time period as the workload data used to apply thestandards. 5.3.3.4.  See Table 5.1. for specific instructions for building the mathematical equation of a FEEby using regression analysis. An example of data used to build a FEE is shown in Figure 5.4.. AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003135Table 5.1.  Construction of the Mathematical Equation for a FEE. A B S T E P 1 2 3 Action Example Identify all work centers within a functional area. Identify all locations in the MAJCOM which have work centers from this functional area. Identify which of the locations identified in step 2 can be grouped together to build a FEE. However, if circumstances dictate more than one grouping of bases (e.g., locations where the MAJCOM is host versus locations where the MAJCOM is a tenant) build a FEE for each grouping. Each location can be in only one grouping. Within functional area 81XX there are four work centers: 81A1, 81B1, 81C1, and 81D1. There are twenty locations in command ABC that have this functional area. Assume all twenty locations in command ABC can be treated as one group. This will result in the building of only one FEE. 4  Select the PEFs to be tested for each of the groupings of locations identified in step 3. 5  At each MAJCOM location, obtain the manpower requirements for each work center in the function by applying its manpower standard. 6  At each location, sum the results of step 5 to get the total functional requirements. 7  At each location, determine a monthly PEF value from analysis of actual values experienced during the same time period as the workload data used to apply the standards. Base population will be tested for this function. At base 1, the following requirements were obtained.

For base 1, the monthly base population value is 2528. 8  Fit the regression line to the data. See Figure 5.4. 136AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003Figure 5.4.  Example of Data Used to Build a FEE.

There are no classification categories for a FEE. However, a FEE built using regressionanalysis must satisfy the statistical criteria of the measurement method selected. (See Attachment2, Table 2.3., Data Source and Statistical Analysis for criteria.) If it does not, then use an equationin the form of Y = bX, where:         Y = Manpower Requirements for a Functional Area          b = Standard Application Requirements    Historical Monthly PEF Value          X = Programmed PEF Value 5.3.3.6.  When a FEE applies to four or less locations in a MAJCOM, build the mathematicalequation for the FEE using instructions for the single location and small population standard inChapter 11. 5.3.4.  Build the adjustment and percentage factors of a FEE using information from application of thework center standards, data found in the UMD, and values resulting from the development of theFEE’s mathematical equation. 5.3.4.1.  Compute the adjustment factor for each location in the MAJCOM (see Figure 5.5.). Thisvalue identifies how much each location's manpower requirement total, obtained from applicationof the function's manpower standards, is different from the manpower requirement total obtainedfrom application of the FEE. Apply both the FEE and the standard to get this factor. Round theadjustment factor to three decimal places. 138AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003Figure 5.5.

The remaining FEE factors are percentages that show what percent of the total functionalarea requirements is in each PEC and what percent is in other various manpower categories. Com-pute different factors for the work center, base, and MAJCOM levels. There are three kinds of per-centage factors needed for each base in a MAJCOM. +9.788 -5.897 +1.306 -2.504 -8.640  +.451 +1.785 +9.488 -1.624 -1.817 -5.297 -1.220 -10.105 +10.500    -4.154 +19.564   -3.950 +11.872   -9.804 -9.742 5.3.4.2.1.

From this analysis and other guidance that may be appropriate, split the manpower category totals found in step 2 into the appropriate PECs. 6  Determine the manpower category percentages for each PEC within each work center. Divide each manpower category requirement within a PEC by that PEC's total work center requirement. Combine the officer and airmen requirements to compute a military percentage instead of a percentage for each.

Functional Model Uses.  6.1.1.  The functional model is a mathematical equation that relates the current distribution of man-power to a specific workload. The relationship may not provide accurate manpower requirementssince the current distribution of manpower may not be correct. 6.1.2.  The functional model is a method used to develop manpower equations, estimate wartimerequirements, and analyze potential workload factors. 6.2.  Standards Development.  6.2.1.  Before model construction, analyze and adjust authorized and assigned data to reflect approvedinitiatives. An example of constructing a model and incorporating initiatives is shown in Figure 6.1.. Figure 6.1.  Functional Model Standard Development. Functional model example: Step 1.  Develop model equation using assigned or authorized man-hours as the dependent variable (Y).  The decision to use  authorized or assigned is made in consultation with the OPR.  Regress this variable against six to twelve months of average workload.

Equation Selection. Because the difference between authorized and assigned strength represents less than ten percent of the total authorized, (77 - 76)/ 77 = 1.3%, and because the OPR did not state a preference, the authorized man-hour equation was selected as the functional model because of the better statistics. Step 3. Establish Baseline. Use selected equation to determine calculated man-hours. These calculated man-hours will be used as the baseline for the functional model.

In this instance, data from the different months would be adjusted rather than the different bases. 6.2.2.  The dependent variable (Y) used in the functional model may be either assigned or authorizedman-hours. Convert assigned or authorized strength to man-hours by multiplying by the pertinentMAF and overload factor. 6.2.3.  Consult with the OPR and decide whether to use authorized or assigned man-hours. When thereis a large difference between the two, discuss this disparity with the OPR, and select the proper depen-dent variable. Correlate the dependent variable with the independent workload variables. 6.2.4.  In situations where authorized and assigned man-hours are closely compatible, use the analysisof variation and correlation criteria to select the best dependent variable (Y). When these statisticalcriteria are used, assigned strengths should not differ from authorized strengths by more than 10 per-cent when input points are totaled. 6.2.5.  Make sure the minimum number of input locations is satisfied when developing the functionalmodel. 6.2.6.  Use the selected equation to calculate required man-hours. Make sure a representative period ofworkload data is used to apply the equation. This sets up the man-hour data base for the first equation.After setting up the data base, subtract the man-hours saved due to initiatives. Regress adjustedman-hours against workload (same x-values) to develop the final man-hour equation. 6.3.  Wartime Requirements Modeling.  6.3.1.  Periodically, wartime manpower requirements are estimated for each Air Force support activ-ity. MAJCOMs identify and document deployment requirements, in-place requirements, shortfalls,and untasked resources. Deployment requirements are based on force requirements identified in aforce sizing exercise (such as Total Force Assessment) Time Phased Force Deployment Document.In-place manpower requirements are based on programmed wartime workload and wartime man-houravailability factors. The requirement data is grouped by specialty, skill, and manpower resource cate-gory. 6.3.2.  Construct a functional model for wartime based on the above manpower requirements andworkload available from each MAJCOM. Follow the same procedures and sequence used for analyz-ing peacetime requirements. 6.3.3.  Use stated wartime manpower requirements as the dependent variable. 6.3.4.  Use wartime-related workload values as the independent variable. 6.3.5.  Analyze separate models for the two wartime populations. 6.3.5.1.  In-place units not deploying to a combat theater. 6.3.5.2.  Combat theater units and units deploying to a combat theater under a force sizing sce-nario. AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 20031496.3.6.  When using a functional model for wartime requirements pending standards development, fur-nish this additional information. 6.3.6.1.  Specialty and skill requirements. 6.3.6.2.  Functional statement of wartime responsibilities. Get responsibilities from the functionalguidance included in the United States Air Force War and Mobilization Plan, Volume 1; Base Sup-port Plan, Volumes 1 and 2; and Total Force Assessment guidance. 6.4.  Using a Functional Model to Analyze Potential Workload Factors.  6.4.1.  During study familiarization, use the functional model to analyze potential WLFs. The size ofthe standard error and the number of extreme deviations from the line often show the degree of relat-ability. Other means of evaluation such as activity analysis charts, discussions with the functionalOPR, and logical analysis help refine the list of potential workload factors. 6.4.2.  The following steps identify the procedures which should be followed when using a functionalmodel to analyze potential workload factors: 6.4.2.1.  Step 1. Pick the work center or functional area to be analyzed. 6.4.2.2.  Step 2. Pick candidate workload and program variables that logically relate to manpowerauthorizations in the UMD and for data available from programming documents or formal reports. 6.4.2.3.  Step 3. Get the manpower data from the UMD for each location and time period underconsideration. Use the volume of the selected variables for the same time periods. 6.4.2.4.  Step 4. Analyze data. 6.4.2.4.1.  Check manpower and workload data with the functional OPR and revise any datathat both parties agree is incorrect. 6.4.2.4.2.  Plot the data pairs on a scattergram and analyze the relative position of each plotwith respect to a trend or pattern of the overall display. Prepare the plot manually or by com-puter. 6.4.2.4.3.  Do regression analysis to find the relationship between manpower authorizationsand the candidate workload variables. Regression analysis procedures and interpretation of theresults are in Chapter 2. 6.4.2.4.4.  Investigate any extreme deviation in the data points. The purpose of this investiga-tion is to find whether a high standard error (deviation) is due to management design orwell-documented reasons. If so, include those reasons as part of the functional model backupdata. Typical reasons are: mixed data from different organizational levels, incorrectly definedFACs, and organizational structure codes, geographic population differences, use of contractservices at some locations, differences in management philosophy and personnel utilization,organizational structure differences, and lack of a quantitative relationship between manpowerand the tested workload variables. The investigation should give some clues to the expectedbenefit of alternative study approaches. A full study of the functions at selected locations maybe needed to identify the reasons for large deviations. Separate standards may be needed toshow multiple populations that are shown by the scattergram. 150AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 20036.4.2.5.  Step 5. Repeat steps 2 through 4 to evaluate alternative workload variables. Additionalmodels using assigned strength or wartime manpower distributions instead of authorizations maygive more insight into manpower requirements, variations by location or condition, and potentialWLFs. For example, analysis of assigned strength and the historical workload relate to a produc-tivity index and show the work done by expended manpower. Given consistent workload and effi-cient operations, expended resources should relate to future requirements. Models are alsovaluable for analyzing the potential differences that may need different populations for standardcoverage. 6.5.  Example of a Functional Model.  Figure 6.2. is an example of a functional model. Note that theequation and all data points are plotted for ease of analysis. The functional model shown doesn't show agood relationship between manpower and the tested workload variable. Although this relationship doesn'trequire discarding the potential WLF, it does show the absence of a strong relationship. AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003151Figure 6.2.

General Concepts.  7.1.1.  Importance of Minimum Manpower and Standby. Management decisions often produce mini-mum manpower levels that drive standby time. Since all standby time included in a manpower stan-dard is nonproductive and costly, it must be justified. Mission-essential standby time is allowed inmanpower studies; however, to merely show the computations used to derive standby time is notenough. Validate management decisions leading to minimum manpower requirements and associatedstandby time. 7.1.2.  Standby Levels. 7.1.2.1.  Standby, delay, and on-call time are defined in Attachment 1, Terms. Standby time canoccur at any workload volume, and minimum manpower requirements may change from locationto location. 7.1.2.2.  Figure 7.1. is a Venn Diagram that depicts minimum manpower requirements at low(case 1) and high (case 2) workload volumes. In both cases, the minimum manpower requirementsare considered constant and are represented by circles of the same size. In case 1, the minimummanpower requirement is equal to the total man-hours available to do work, that is, the universe isequal to man-hours required by minimum manpower requirements. Standby is the differencebetween man-hours required by minimum manpower and man-hours required by productivework. AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003153Figure 7.1.  Depiction of Input Measurement Data. 7.1.2.3.  In case 2, Figure 7.1., the minimum manpower requirement is less than total man-hoursavailable for productive work. That is, the universe is equal to total hours available to do produc-tive work. Derivation of standby in this case is more difficult. 7.1.2.4.  Figure 7.2. shows another situation similar to Figure 7.1.. In situation I, bases A and Bwhose workload volume is less than Xi, represent a case 1 situation. Bases C, D, and E whoseworkload volume is greater than Xi, represent case 2. For case 1 (bases A and B), derive standbytime as shown in the previous paragraph. At bases C, D, and E, however, this procedure cannot beapplied. In situation II, bases A and C represent a case 1 situation. 154AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003Figure 7.2.  Minimum Manpower Relationships. 7.1.2.5.  Minimum manpower requirements may be constant for each shift (Figure 7.1. and Fig-ure 7.2., A, show this condition), or they may vary with workload volume. Figure 7.2., B, showsminimum manpower at two levels: one for workload volumes less than Xi, and one for workloadvolumes greater than Xi. This situation is possible, for example, in an aircraft loading operationwhere a second load crew is needed to meet specified turnaround or ground time. Note in Figure7.2., B, that bases A and C on the chart show varying amounts of standby time. The standby timeis derived and computed as part of the allowed man-hours. It is not dependent on the regressionline. 7.1.2.6.  When the regression equation excludes standby time, a particular location may not haveenough man-hours to cover the directed standby requirement. This location would receive creditfor either the computed man-hours or measured man-hours (work center man-hours plus standby),whichever is greater. This standby time is referred to as derived standby. Document the minimummanpower condition in the application instructions in the manpower standard. 7.1.3.  Observations Regarding Standby Time. 7.1.3.1.  Minimum manpower requirements may be the same at all locations or may change withworkload volume. 7.1.3.2.  Identify minimum manpower requirements by MEP work measurement methods if levelsof service are properly defined before measurement. 7.1.3.3.  Allow only standby necessary for mission accomplishment. AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 20031557.1.3.4.  Reduce standby time by transferring productive work to replace measured standbyman-hours. 7.1.3.5.  Classify standby work inherent in one's assigned duty (for example, a craftsman continu-ously observing instruments) as productive work. 7.2.  Rationale for Minimum Manpower.  7.2.1.  Contributing Factors. Numerous factors contribute to establishing minimum manpowerrequirements. Some of these factors, often a result of management decisions, are: 7.2.1.1.  Mission needs. 7.2.1.2.  Performance standards. 7.2.1.3.  Machine design. 7.2.1.4.  Facility limitations. 7.2.1.5.  Hours of operation. 7.2.1.6.  Shift size and necessity. 7.2.1.7.  Crew size. 7.2.1.8.  Post-manpower requirements. 7.2.1.9.  Safety. 7.2.1.10.  Security. 7.2.2.  Evaluating Minimum Manpower Requirements. Carefully check the need for minimum man-power. Question the basic need. Offer alternatives and clearly define the cost of such service. Studydocumentation must contain rationale to justify minimum manpower requirements. After the func-tional OPR confirms minimum manpower requirements, quantifying standby time is generallystraightforward. Reduce or minimize standby time through improved shift scheduling, reorganization,planning, and workload control techniques. MEP personnel must be ready to show the manager howto meet the needed performance standards with minimum standby time. When standby time is mini-mized, the total manpower requirement is also minimized. 7.2.3.  Minimum Manpower Computations. 7.2.3.1.  In those situations that meet the criteria, you can use the minimum manpower factor(MMF) method to develop a standard. This method uses predetermined manpower factors to com-pute manpower requirements for an OPR-approved position. Compute the factor by dividing theman-hours for position coverage by the pertinent man-hour availability factor (MAF) times theoverload factor (for military). Adjust the MAF to allow for additional man-hours associated withposition coverage. These additional man-hours fall into two categories. 7.2.3.1.1.  The first category consists of man-hours needed for processes that must be doneeither before or after the position coverage starts. In the case of security police guard posts, forexample, the security police officer must get a weapon and ammunition from the armory andattend guard mount before assuming the post. Likewise, at the end of the shift, the officer mustturn in the weapon and ammunition to the armory. The time associated with this work is inaddition to the time needed for post duty and should be measured as such. 156AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 20037.2.3.1.2.  The second category of additional man-hours consists of recurring training timeneeded to keep an individual qualified to fill the position. This is training that cannot bereceived while the individual is actually on position duty. An example of this type of trainingis proficiency or refresher training needed by all security police officers such as weapons train-ing. Before developing a special allowance, make sure such training has not already been cred-ited in the MAF. 7.2.3.1.3.  When additional allowances are given for these two types of position-relatedman-hours, derive the man-hours used in computing the allowances from work measurement. 7.2.3.2.  To compute required manpower, divide the position coverage in man-hours by the MAFtimes the overload factor. For example, a position requiring coverage 7 days a week (includingholidays), 24 hours a day, by one individual generates a requirement for 730.464 monthlyman-hours. If the work force is military, on a 40-hour workweek, the manpower requirement is4.476 (730.464/(151.5 x 1.077)). However, if the work force is military on a 6-day, 60-hour work-week, the manpower factor is 2.971 (730.464/(245.9 x 1.012)). These numbers, 4.476 and 2.971,are minimum manpower factors. Standby time is normally an inherent part of positions based onminimum manpower factor application, such as security police assigned to a base access gate andfirefighters. 7.2.3.3.  Use this equation to compute minimum manpower factors. Use continuous calculations,i.e., don't round until all calculations are done. MMF =  (Days/Wk)(Hrs/Day)(4.348 Wks/Mo*)(DRF**) (Crew Size)                                              Man-hour Available Factor x Overload Factor *Use the pertinent weekly conversion factor based on the number of days per week and whether ornot federal holidays are worked. (See Table 9.2.) **The directed requirement factor (DRF) is a constant man-hour requirement directed by higherheadquarters policy in addition to duties for a minimum manpower situation. The DRF is equal to1.000 unless the work is not part of the duties for a minimum manpower situation. For example, ifeach person must receive 2.50 hours per month of proficiency or refresher training, and trainingcannot be received while the person is on the job, then compute the DRF as follows:   DRF = 1+ [(T/(MAF-T)]   where T = required training hours   If T = 2.5 and MAF = 151.5, then   DRF = 1 + [2.5/(151.5 - 2.5)] = 1.017 When the DRF and crew size are both equal to 1, the minimum manpower factor values are thesame as the post manning factor values identified in AFI 38-201. 7.2.3.4.  Furnish the minimum manpower factor computations per paragraph 7.2.3.3. as backup. 7.2.3.5.  Certain functions such as security police need adjustments to these procedures. In thiscase, compute a minimum manpower requirement for each position; sum the minimum manpowerrequirements; and, round up to whole manpower requirements. For example, a small Air Forcebase in Texas has three gates. Main gate duties are assumed by two security police officers, 24hours a day, 7 days a week. East gate duties are assumed by one security police officer, 8 hours aAFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003157day, 5 days a week. West gate duties are assumed by one security police officer, 4 hours a day (allin one shift), 5 days a week. The east and west gates are closed for holidays (10 days a year). Thesecurity police work center that has the mission of providing manpower for these gates is on a40-hour workweek. Position-coverage associated work requires 0.669 hours per shift as deter-mined by work measurement (see para 7.2.3.1.1. for explanation) and recurring training that can-not be done while at the positions requires 5.40 hours per month per person. The total manpowerrequirement for these three gates is as follows: 7.2.3.5.1.  Calculate the DRF for training.          DRF = 1 + [T/(MAF - T)] = 1 + [5.40/(MAF - 5.40)]       Since the MAF for a military 40-hour workweek is 151.5, DRF = 1 + [5.40/(151.5 - 5.40)] = 1.037. Apply this factor to the total man-hours required to fill the post, that is, to both the basic posi-tion coverage and the position-coverage associated work. Since the main gate has three shifts, the total daily man-hours for position-coverage associated work is 3(0.669) = 2.007. Adding this result to the 24 man-hours of position coverage per day equals 26.007. This result (26.007) is the entry for the "hours/day" item in the MMF formula for the main gate.  MMF  =   (Days/Wk)(Hrs/Day)(4.348 Wks/Mo)(DRF)(Crew Size)                          Man-hour Available Factor x Overload Factor  MMF  = (7)(26.007)(4.348)(1.037) (2) = 10.061                             151.5 x 1.077 7.2.3.5.2.  East gate duties are assumed by one security police officer, 8 hours a day, 5 days aweek. This position coverage only needs one shift so the total entry for the "hours/day" item inthe minimum manpower factor formula is 8 + 0.669 = 8.669. But there is another problem.This position is not filled during holidays (10 days a year), and the conversion factor (4.348weeks/month) will add unneeded man-hours to the position coverage because it includes holi-days. Derive this conversion factor as follows: 365.25 days/Yr - weekend days not worked - federal holidays not worked = duty  days/year  duty days/year / 12 months = duty days/month 158AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003 duty days/month / normal duty days/week = weekly conversion factor Since position coverage does not include holidays, do not add a false cost. Therefore, replace this conversion factor with a new one that does not include the 10 holidays as follows:  365.25 days/year - 104.36 (weekend days not worked) - 10 (federal holidays) = 250.89 duty days/year  250.89 / 12 = 20.9075  20.9075 / 5 (normal duty days/week) = 4.182 weeks/Mo Now the minimum manpower factor formula for the east gate is:  MMF = (Days/Wk)(Hrs/Day)(4.182 Wks/Mo)(DRF) (Crew Size)                      Man-hour Available Factor x Overload Factor  MMF = (5)(8.669)(4.182)(1.037) (1) = 1.152                        151.5 x 1.077 7.2.3.5.3.  West gate duties are assumed by one security police officer, 4 hours a day, 5 daysper week. The gate is closed on holidays. Although 4 hours is not a complete shift, 0.669 hoursare still associated with the shift because the same work would apply to a partial shift as to awhole shift. The entry for the hours per day item in the minimum manpower factor formula is4.669, and the MMF is calculated as follows:  MMF = (Days/Wk)(Hrs/Day)(4.182 Wks/Mo)(DRF)(Crew Size)                        Man-hour Available Factor x Overload Factor  MMF = (5)(4.669)(4.182)(1.037) (1) = 0.620                          151.5 x 1.077 AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 20031597.2.3.5.4.  To find total manpower requirement for assuming the duties for the three gates, addthe three MMFs: 10.061 + l.152 + 0.620 = 11.833. Round 11.833 up to 12 manpower require-ments. 7.2.3.6.  When determining minimum manpower factors for multiple posts of the same make-up inhours of operation, crew size, DRF, etc., compute the minimum manpower equation for a singlepost and multiply the result by the number of posts authorized for the function under study. 7.2.3.7.  Document minimum manpower as follows: 7.2.3.7.1.  When the minimum manpower computation is not the sole measurement method forthe work center, compute the man-hours by multiplying the rounded minimum manpowerrequirement by the pertinent MAF multiplied by the overload factor. 7.2.3.7.2.  When the minimum manpower computation is the sole measurement method for thework center, furnish only the minimum manpower factor computation. There is no need toconvert the rounded minimum manpower into man-hours. (NOTE: A chart documenting minimum manpower for various work weeks and MAFs islocated at the AFMIA home page, https://www.afmia.randolph.af.mil. Go to MOLibrary>Manpower Standards>Tech Guidance & Forms>Spreadsheets> Minimum Man-power Example.) Section 7B—Standby Determination with Man-Hour Collection Method 7.3.  Study Design.  7.3.1.  A well-designed study accurately shows minimum manpower requirements and true standbytime. The measurement plan tells how to measure minimum manpower requirements and how to iden-tify standby time. Necessary standby man-hours cannot be identified during standards development,when it is grouped in with other nonproductive categories of time and when the minimum manpowerrequirements have not been accurately documented. 7.3.2.  Clearly define the method for measuring standby when the possibility of standby time exists.Use MEP standard data collection and work measurement procedures to identify standby; however,some innovation is needed with these methods. Do not simply state queuing or shift profile analysiswill be used to quantify standby time; tell how inputs use these techniques. Standby time is discussedin conjunction with various data collection and analysis procedures in the paragraphs that follow. 7.3.3.  Include standby time computed according to procedures of this section as input to regressionanalysis when developing the standard man-hour equation. Build a variance for applicable locations ifstandby time does not exist at all locations. 7.4.  Data Collection and Analysis Procedures. Use a man-hour shift profile chart to aid in analyzingstandby time when work sampling or queuing is used and standby time exists (see Section 7C). 7.4.1.  Queuing Analysis. Queuing data does not directly identify allowed standby time. The percent-age of server time in productive direct work may be determined with the queuing utilization factorafter an acceptable level of service has been determined (for example, the number of taxi driversneeded to give a 4 minute response time). Queuing also shows when servers are not busy, including160AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003standby time. Design the study to collect queuing data on standby time if queuing is used. Detailsdescribing queuing techniques are in Chapter 16. 7.4.2.  Work Sampling. 7.4.2.1.  Identify standby time during Work Sampling observation rounds when minimum man-power requirements are previously defined. For example, suppose a finance office requires thatcustomers with pay inquiries be waited on within 30 minutes of customer arrival. It has been pre-determined that two finance clerks are necessary to give this level of service at the finance counterbetween 0900 and 1500. 7.4.2.2.  Make provisions to isolate and identify the required standby time when the work samplerknows this information before the study begins. On each observation round, the work samplerrecords each worker in the respective process. The observer may enter a maximum of two standbytallies during each observation round but this would occur only if both service clerks were await-ing customers. 7.4.2.3.  Use standby time derived in this manner to show management the manpower cost of pro-viding this level of service. Analysis of WS observation sheets and waiting time data (for example,the time finance customers actually wait for service) may reveal that the specified level of servicehas been exceeded or that the second server is needed only during peak periods, such as pay days. 7.4.2.4.  Standby time collected in this manner represents adjusted or derived standby timerequired to support a predetermined level of service. Record it on an AF Form 308, StandardInput Data Computation, per Table 7.1.. However, if the level of service is not clearly defined,it is impossible to identify whether the worker should be sampled as idle or standby. Build aman-hour shift profile chart to find required standby when this is the case. AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003161Table 7.1.  How to Prepare AF Form 308, Standard Input Data Computation.

Include enough rationale in the final report to support the minimum manpower require-ment when using OA as the primary work measurement method. It is not necessary to measurestandby time if the minimum manpower requirement represents the total man-hour universe as incase 1, Figure 7.1.. 7.4.3.2.  Minimize and fully explain all standby allowed in the study when the total man-hour uni-verse is greater than the minimum manpower requirement (case 2, Figure 7.1.). Developing aman-hour shift profile chart from OA measurement may be difficult because process times are notassociated with each hour of the duty day. Therefore, consider using short-cycle WS to collectman-hours for a man-hour shift profile chart. Use the WS as back-up for the OA man-hours. Sec-tion 7C describes procedures for the man-hour shift profile chart. Section 7C—Man-Hour Shift Profile Analysis7.5.  Introduction to the Man-Hour Shift Profile Chart. Man-hour shift profile charts are an effectiveway to identify and minimize standby time. They aid the analyst in defining the minimum essential man-power levels by: 7.5.1.  Leveling workloads to economize on nonproductive standby periods. 7.5.2.  Identifying minimum standby time based on the accepted level of service. 7.6.  Use of the Man-Hour Shift Profile Chart.  7.6.1.  The man-hour shift profile chart helps functional managers realize economies of operation andhelps MEP personnel build accurate manpower standards. Use this process as a data analysis tech-nique during management consultant studies or with other data collection methods during a man-power standards study. 7.6.2.  The man-hour shift profile is used by manpower management personnel to justify standbyrequirements. Input teams use the chart to find the proper amounts of standby time to include in mea-surement reports when: 7.6.2.1.  Queuing analysis is the primary standard development technique, or 7.6.2.2.  WS is the primary work measurement method and standby time cannot be distinguishedfrom other nonproductive categories during the sampling period. 7.7.  How to Develop the Present Man-Hour Shift Profile Chart.  7.7.1.  Only construct the profile chart from data obtained during work measurement if certain provi-sions are taken during data collection. That is, collect data so it can be summarized by process on astratified time basis (normally, hour-by-hour). 7.7.2.  Identify work in the POD as transferable and nontransferable when a man-hour shift profilechart is needed. This helps in making the shift profile chart that shows productive work for the strati-fied time increments. 7.7.3.  The basic steps in developing man-hour shift profile charts are collecting necessary data, doingend-of-study computations, and constructing the chart. Derive the average man-hours for each hour ofthe day that are used in the profile chart from queuing analysis or from WS data. When using the shiftprofile chart to minimize standby time, make sure the sample size is large enough to support recom-AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003163mendations based on the profile chart. The procedures for developing a shift profile chart using WSdata follow: 7.7.3.1.  Accumulate the transferable and nontransferable time on a daily basis for each hour orhalf-hour of each shift. Average this time for the study period. Extract this time from the AF Form1157, Work Sampling Recapitulation. On some occasions, a separate WS study may be neededto develop the profile chart. When this is so, take enough samples to reach desired accuracy andcollect only the productive time. Classify the productive work into transferable or nontransferablework. Consult work center personnel to make this classification if the POD has not been marked. 7.7.3.2.  Construct the present man-hour shift profile chart on graph paper (see Figure 7.3.) as fol-lows: 164AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003Figure 7.3.  Man-Hour Shift Profile, Present. AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 20031657.7.3.2.1.  Identify average man-hours per hour on the vertical axis. 7.7.3.2.2.  Identify each stratified period for each shift (hour or half hour) on the horizontalaxis. 7.7.3.2.3.  Extend a vertical line downward from the duty hour corresponding to each shiftchange, and state the minimum manpower requirement for that shift. 7.7.3.2.4.  Plot, from bottom to top, the average nontransferable and transferable man-hourscomputed for each stratified period. 7.7.3.2.5.  Identify the nontransferable and transferable time within each stratified period. Col-ored pencils are helpful in this identification when the charts do not have to be reproduced. 7.7.3.2.6.  Group the various periods that make up each existing shift. Find the largest require-ment within each shift and extend a dark horizontal line over the entire shift. 7.7.3.2.7.  Extend vertical lines from each stratified period up to the next whole hour above theplots for transferable time. When there is only nontransferable time within the strata, extendthe vertical line from that plot to the next whole hour. The extended portion of the column ispotential standby time. In most cases, the total man-hours per shift period include both poten-tial standby time and other nonproductive time. 7.7.3.2.8.  Prepare a legend for the chart that identifies nontransferable, transferable, standbytime, and other nonproductive time. 7.8.  How to Analyze the Man-Hour Shift Profile Chart.  7.8.1.  Shift profile analysis can point out deficiencies in scheduling practices, or it can point outexcessive minimum manpower levels. Further study of the actual shift profile chart may lead to addi-tional benefits such as more efficient choices for shift hours. 7.8.2.  Input teams analyze the actual shift profile chart to find the proper adjustments to make tostandby time before constructing the proposed shift profile chart. An analysis of the chart may showthe need for overlapping or split shifts. Although split shifts are sometimes necessary, they should bekept to a minimum. During analysis, remember: 7.8.2.1.  An evenly spread workload often reduces manpower needs. 7.8.2.2.  A related work center with standby man-hours may be able to accept some transferablework. This can take place only if the work can be done by the individuals receiving the work. 7.8.2.3.  Adjustments to existing standby time should be coordinated with local OPRs. Adjust-ments must not add man-hours to exceed the stated level of service. 7.8.3.  Study teams analyze the charts sent by measurement teams. A large amount of standby time atone location may mean a variance is needed at that location. On the other hand, it may mean the inputteam did not properly adjust the standby time. The study team must not adjust standby time withoutcoordinating with the input team. This prevents dual adjustments of the same time. The study teamdoes not average or prorate standby time during data analysis. 7.8.4.  Figure 7.4. shows a properly constructed man-hour shift profile chart that identifies recom-mended time movements. 166AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003Figure 7.4.  Man-Hour Shift Profile, Time Movements. 7.9.  How to Develop the Proposed Man-Hour Shift Profile Chart. Construct a proposed shift profilechart when an improvement can be made to the actual shift profile. Construct this chart the same way asthe present profile chart, but do it in conjunction with the analysis step. The proposed chart often uncoversfaults with analysis of the present profile chart. These steps tell how to develop a proposed profile chart(see Figure 7.5.). AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003167Figure 7.5.  Man-Hour Shift Profile, Proposed. 7.9.1.  Step 1. For purposes of this example, assume that the prestated minimum manpower requiredfor the A and B shift is two and the minimum manpower required for the C shift is one. The proposed168AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003chart must accommodate this minimum manpower requirement. 7.9.2.  Step 2. Examine the present man-hour shift profile. In Figure 7.3., examination shows largestandby and nonproductive time within shifts A and B. This is a logical place to look for improve-ments. 7.9.3.  Step 3. Experiment with different arrangements by moving transferable man-hours into periodswith large amounts of standby. Move the transferable time to nearby hours within the same shift ifpossible. The objective is to reduce the nonproductive time that results when each column on the chartis extended up to the total man-hours required per shift line. 7.9.4.  Step 4. Experiment with different shift hours or with overlapping shifts to reduce nonproduc-tive time. Consider this possibility when a large man-hour required per shift column exists near a pro-posed shift change period. Figure 7.5., Man-Hour Shift Profile, Proposed, shows where transferableman-hours were moved within the same shift. Figure 7.6., Proposed Shift Schedule, shows how over-lapping shifts were used to reduce man-hours required per shift. 7.9.5.  Step 5. Compute the derived standby time from the proposed chart. AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003169Figure 7.6.  Proposed Shift Schedule.

Quantify standbyman-hours and use them to accomplish associated work of another work center or processes of workdriven by other than minimum manpower factor manning requirements. Consider using standby timebetween work centers when minimum manpower factor manning is used. Section 7D—Deriving Standby Using Minimum Manpower and Measured Man-Hours7.12.  General Concepts. Use an AF Form 308 to account for man-hour data obtained from work sam-pling, operational audit, time study, and other specialized measurement methods. Use the form to addsampled standby time with measured data. 7.12.1.  Follow the full instructions in Table 7.1. when completing the AF Form 308. 7.12.2.  The derivation of standby is shown in Figure 7.7.. In this figure, the difference between thetotal allowed time and the minimum man-hour requirement is standby time. Derive standby time forwork sampling studies with the man-hour shift profile chart. Attach the standby computation to theAF Form 308 when this form is used to consolidate work measurement methods. Include the standbycomputation in Part Four of the final report when AF Form 308 is not used. AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003171Figure 7.7.

The following minimum manpower computation (based on the minimum manpower factor equation) supports the derived standby time: Shift A   0800-1600 5 days/week excluding holidays                                         [(5 days/wk)(8 hrs/day)(4.182 wks/mo)(1.00 DRF*)] 4(persons rqd) = 669.12Shift B   0800-1600 7 days/week including holidays [(7 days/wk)(8 hrs/day)(4.348 wks/mo)(1.00 DRF)]  2(persons rqd)  = 486.98Shift C   1600-2400 7 days/week including holidays [(7 days/wk)(8 hrs/day)(4.348 wks/mo)(1.00 DRF)]  2(persons rqd)  = 486.98Shift D   2400-0800 7 days/week including holidays  [(7 days/wk)(8 hrs/day)(4.348 wks/mo)(1.00 DRF)]  2(persons rqd)  = 486.98Total Minimum Man-hours Per Month = 2130.06Total Allowed Man-hours = 2032.73Minimum Man-hours/Month =            2130.06 Less Total Allowed Man-hours =         2032.73 Derived Standby Time =                        97.33 *Directed requirement factor (DRF) is a constant man-hour requirement directed by higher headquarters policy in addition to duties for a minimum manpower situation.  (The DRF is equal to 1.00 unless otherwise required.) 172AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003Chapter 8 MODULAR EQUATIONS 8.1.  General Concepts. Modular equations are a series of separate equations rather than one single equa-tion. These individual equations represent independent processes that comprise the required man-hoursfor the work center. While this type of representation is not right, nor needed for every work center, it doesgive visibility to the required man-hours for a work center by process. Attributes of the modular equationto consider are: 8.1.1.  Develop modular equations for individual processes that represent different levels of servicefurnished to the customer. Based on these level of service modules, the OPR has the flexibility tochoose the pertinent module for a given location or situation. 8.1.2.  As work center requirements change (processes added, deleted, or modified), change the indi-vidual modules (insert or remove) to show the new work center requirements. This makes it relativelyeasy and cost-effective to maintain the standard. 8.1.3.  By virtue of design, calculate a "man-hour cost" associated with each process when using mod-ular equations. 8.1.4.  Modular equations make it easy to analyze a work center for "what-ifs." 8.1.5.  Represent individual processes not performed at all locations with a standard at the processlevel. Development of variances is therefore eliminated. 8.2.  Specific Design Considerations.  8.2.1.  The first and perhaps the most critical step in using a modular equation in standards develop-ment is the initial research. Carefully research the nature and function of the work center to determinethe suitability and feasibility of describing the work center as a composite of independent processes.Use the modular equations procedure only when the man-hours needed for a work center can be sub-divided into independent modules of work that account for all man-hours. These modules may repre-sent one or more processes as defined in a POD. Limit the number of modules to a minimum to reducethe complexity involved in using such a standard. 8.2.1.1.  A module of work is independent if it can be added to or removed from the work centerwithout imposing an increase or decrease in man-hours in another module. Thus, it can be consid-ered a module in a modular equation. To rephrase this idea of independence, a work center thatneeds a given number of hours to do the work within module A is not expected to experience achange in these hours due to increases or decreases in the work in module B. 8.2.1.2.  See Figure 8.1. for a simplistic example indicating a potential use for POD processes ina modular equation. AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003173Figure 8.1.  Simplistic Example Relationship Between POD and Modular Equation Processes. 8.2.1.2.1.  In Figure 8.1., POD processes 3 and 5 are not independent because the amount oftime needed to keep bench stock is related to the number of engines to be repaired. Therefore,if the workload is increased in process 3 (that is, more engines to be repaired), the work in bothprocesses would increase. In a modular equation, consider these two processes (and possiblyothers) in one general process - engine repair. 8.2.1.2.2.  POD process 4 is independent of processes 3 and 5 since periodic inspections aredone on all engines. The addition (or deletion) of the work would not change the hours neededto do engine repair or keep bench stock supplies. Represent this process with a different mod-ule in the modular equation. 8.2.2.  Each module must have at least one workload factor that is logically and statistically related tothe work described. 8.2.3.  Each module must meet the minimum number of input locations. 8.2.3.1.  Include as modules of work only those that are present in at least five of the work centerlocations. Any fewer is considered a variance or a small population. 8.2.3.2.  Each module must meet the minimum number of locations for measurement according toAFMAN 38-208, Volume 1, Table 3.4. 8.2.3.3.  Measure some locations with all modules present. This produces a more accurate state-ment of the required work. This procedure tends to reduce the number of variances needed for thestandard. 8.3.  Indirect Man-Hours.  8.3.1.  When Operational Audit is the primary measurement method, use SIAMs to credit indirectman-hours. Use SIAMs to form a separate indirect module. Represent this with an equation thatexpresses the indirect man-hours as a function of the direct man-hours. This can either be a linear orparabolic equation. The indirect equation remains separate from the equations for direct work and isapplied only after the direct work is computed. This procedure sets a relationship between indirect and174AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003direct work. Indirect man-hours (Y) are regressed against direct man-hours (X) for each of the inputbases. You can develop your SIAM factor as follows: Y = (a+bx)(SIAM Factor) SIAM Factor =  1 + Measured Indirect Man - Hours                                 Measured Direct Man - Hours         8.3.2.  When work sampling is the primary measurement method in multi-location modular studies,use measured indirect man-hours to form a separate indirect module. Represent this with an equationthat expresses the indirect man-hours as a function of the direct man-hours. Equation developmentand procedures outlined for operational audit also apply to work sampling. 8.3.3.  The b-value in the linear case represents the proportion of indirect time to direct time. Figure8.2. shows relationships between direct and indirect percentages. Use this information as a guide. InFigure 8.3., a typical indirect equation was computed to be: Yind = -15.9354 + .1829 (Ydir). Thisallows an additional 18% (approximately) of the direct time for indirect work. Figure 8.2.  Relationship of Indirect to Direct Man-Hours. If total time is % Direct % Indirect Then the relationship of indirect to direct is: Indirect/Direct 95 90 85 80 75 70 5 10 15 20 25 30 .0526  .1111  .1765  .2500  .3333  .4286  AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003175Figure 8.3.  Graph of the Example Indirect Man-Hour Equation. 8.3.4.  The a-value determines the line with this slope (the b-value) to use. A negative a-value (as inthe example above) does not mean that there is an automatic loss of man-hours. As in any equation,consider the a-value only in combination with the rest of the equation. For a given amount of directwork (for instance 950 hours), compute the hours added for indirect work from the indirect equation.        Yc = -15.9354 +  (.1829)(950.0) = 157.82 8.4.  Developing Modular Equations.  8.4.1.  After a work center has met specific design considerations, develop a modular equation as fol-lows: 8.4.1.1.  Step 1. Identify all work center outputs (customer needed products or services). For eachoutput, develop a task list of the process or processes needed to produce the unit of work (output).For each output, identify a work unit (end item). Using the output task lists, develop a POD so thateach independent process becomes a module and each module has its own work unit. Structure themodules to account for all of the work described in the POD. Be certain each process is includedin one and only one module. Identify the relationship between the modules and the associatedworkload factors. To avoid confusion during equation computation, clearly specify all relation-ships from the beginning. 8.4.1.2.  Step 2. Proceed with the measurement in the usual manner to collect all of the neededman-hours and workload counts. Use normal procedures for data collection and examination. 8.4.1.3.  Step 3. Aggregate the data to the levels necessary for the separate modules. 8.4.1.4.  Step 4. Do regression analysis for each module using procedures in Chapter 2. Keep thestatistics (R², Syx, V) with each equation. 8.4.2.  Present the work center standard as a set of individual equations (Figure 8.4.) that apply toeach module of work. During application, compute only the modules that apply to a specific workcenter. 176AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003177Figure 8.4.

An alternative to developing modular equations as described above is to use ratio unit times.The a-values (fixed man-hours) are developed by computing the mean fixed man-hours of all of themeasurement locations. The b-values (variable man-hours) are developed by computing the meanratio unit times of all of the measurement locations. 178AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003Chapter 9 OPERATIONAL AUDIT (OA) 9.1.  General Concepts.  9.1.1.  The OA measurement method uses activity time values at the process step level. Find these val-ues by the mathematical model T = fiti, where T is the man-hours for activity; fi is the activity fre-quency, and ti is the per accomplishment time (PAT). 9.1.2.  Use the OA method to set standards in practically any type of work center (production, admin-istration, supervision, etc.). 9.1.3.  Also use the OA method to supplement work sampling or time study methods to: 9.1.3.1.  Find time values for work not perfomed during the sampling period. 9.1.3.2.  Document requirements for specific processes not suitable for time study due to low fre-quency or long duration when time study is the primary method. 9.1.4.  OA uses four primary data sources: historical records, directed requirement, good operator tim-ing, and technical estimate. Each of these OA techniques is defined as follows: 9.1.4.1.  Historical Records Technique. The determination of step frequency or PAT by checkingdocumented past work performances of the work center. 9.1.4.2.  Directed Requirement Technique. This technique recognizes and allows some full-timepositions established by regulation such as commander or first sergeant. Directed requirementsmay also apply to directed frequencies, such as monthly inspections, or to directed time values,such as the periodic run-up of a standby electrical power generator. 9.1.4.3.  Good Operator Timing Technique. A technique that establishes time values by measuringthe time a qualified individual expends on a given activity. 9.1.4.4.  Technical Estimate Technique. The determination of the standard hours needed for agiven process step, based on an estimate made by individuals technically and professionally com-petent to judge the needed time. 9.1.5.  OA facilitates standards maintenance. 9.2.  Preparing for OA Measurement.  9.2.1.  The measuring craftsman must prepare in advance for OA to ensure the accuracy and validityof the data. 9.2.2.  Check the POD and SOC with work center personnel. Make sure the craftsman and work centersupervisor both understand the work to be measured, standards of operation, and variations existing atthe specific measurement site. 9.2.3.  Get all workload values for the period specified in the measurement plan. Usually 12 months ofdata is needed; however, the study team makes sure that complete work cycles are covered. 9.2.4.  Identify all frequencies and PATs that can be obtained by using techniques other than technicalestimates. AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 20031799.2.5.  Identify activities that directly relate to other activities. For example, if activity b is alwaysdone as a follow-on to activity a, their frequencies should relate. 9.2.6.  Identify activities that indirectly relate to other activities. For example, in a maintenance workcenter, “part replaced” might relate to “part transaction” processed in a supply work center. 9.2.7.  Find the number and skill of people assigned to the work center in the past 12 months. If 12months of data is not available, the study team sets minimum data needs. 9.2.8.  Find out whether man-hours were borrowed, loaned, or spent in overtime. 9.2.9.  Make sure measured man-hours show required work. Historical workload data and associatedman-hours may not show the real work center needs. Overmanning or undermanning affects the levelof effort and the historical workload production level. Contracted work, backlog, labor negotiations,or future production schedules might also be a factor. Identify and document the impact of these con-ditions during measurement. 9.3.  Frequency (fi) Determination.  9.3.1.  Establish Frequencies. Establish activity frequencies using historical records, directed require-ment, or technical estimate. Each technique is discussed below. 9.3.2.  Historical Record. 9.3.2.1.  Research historical records such as reports, letters, messages, rosters, etc. Verify data withwork center people. 9.3.2.2.  In some cases, it is possible to relate unknown frequencies to reliable recorded data tofind more objective estimates. For example, if there is no record in a work center to show the fre-quency that a particular part is replaced, a check of supply issue records may verify the frequency. 9.3.2.3.  Counts of potential WLFs often equate to activity frequencies that can be used to supportor verify frequencies through an indirect relationship. Evaluate work counts and workload cyclesassociated with specific processes to determine the natural frequency period (for example, daily,weekly, monthly, quarterly or yearly), as well as frequency counts. 9.3.3.  Directed Requirement. 9.3.3.1.  Use frequencies that are predetermined by directive or policy (for example, inspections). 9.3.3.2.  The study team documents directed frequencies in the measurement plan. If frequenciesare not documented, the input team immediately identifies the source of the requirement to thestudy team for potential use at other input measurement sites. 9.3.4.  Technical Estimate. 9.3.4.1.  Use technical estimates for activity frequency only when no alternative data source isavailable. 9.3.4.2.  Exclude extreme estimates when determining average frequency if they are not represen-tative (for example, based on lack of experience or isolated situations). Before discarding a fre-quency as an extreme value, verify its occurrence by cross-referencing it with other relatable stepfrequencies. Do not arbitrarily exclude extreme frequencies without justification. 180AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 20039.3.4.3.  Base estimates on judgment and experience. Get a more confident estimate by samplingthe judgment and experience of several people in the work center. Where two similar work centersexist at the same base in separate organizations, get estimates from both of them. 9.3.4.4.  Use benchmark or expected frequency values included in the measurement plan as aguide for evaluating work center estimates. Expect reasonable variations; however, large varia-tions produced by differences in conditions or levels of service need investigating. 9.4.  Per Accomplishment Time (ti) Determination.  9.4.1.  Determine Activity Man-hours. Determine required activity man-hours using directed require-ments, good operator, historical records, or technical estimates as follows: 9.4.2.  Directed Requirement. 9.4.2.1.  Use per accomplishment times that are predetermined by directive, policy, or other per-formance standards (for example, contract statement of work). 9.4.2.2.  The study team documents directed times in the measurement plan. If this has not beendone, the input team immediately notifies the study team and identifies the source for potential useat other measurement sites. 9.4.3.  Good Operator Timing. 9.4.3.1.  Consult with work center supervisor to jointly select a qualified person who does the pro-cess at an average pace. (If possible, select more than one good operator.) Selecting an averageindividual negates the need for pace rating. 9.4.3.2.  The study team decides on the number of observations needed. 9.4.3.3.  Observe good operator and record time. 9.4.3.4.  Apply the personal, rest, and delay (PR&D) allowance factor. 9.4.4.  Historical Record. 9.4.4.1.  Use recorded historical per accomplishment times only if the method of recording andreporting has been thoroughly checked and validated. 9.4.4.2.  Validate a reporting system by examining several recorded times for the same activity andsampling the accuracy of reported data compared to measured times. 9.4.4.3.  Make sure that the time recorded for work corresponds exactly to the associated activityin the POD. 9.4.4.4.  Use the average historical time based on all representative values. 9.4.4.5.  It is not necessary to apply the PR&D allowance factor to PATs determined by this tech-nique. These PATs are averages derived from estimates; not based on timing of the event. Due tothe lack of precision associated with estimating, it is assumed the estimated average PAT includesenough time for these allowances. 9.4.5.  Technical Estimate. AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 20031819.4.5.1.  Base time estimates on the judgment and experience of a representative number of workcenter personnel. Sample three or four people where possible. The more samples used to deter-mine average time, the more credence given to the estimate. 9.4.5.2.  When the PAT is affected by varying levels of complexity, derive a weighted average PAT(per estimator) based on percent of occurrence. For example:                        Percent of Occurrence Complexity          (must total 100%)             PAT Difficult                       20%                           .75 Normal                       70%                           .50 Easy                           10%                           .20 Weighted PAT = (.20)(.75) + (.70)(.50) + (.10)(.20)              = .15 + .35 + .02              = .52 Give estimates in regard to: 9.4.5.2.1.  The first estimate, the difficult time, is an estimate of the longest time the stepwould take under the most adverse conditions (if things go wrong). 9.4.5.2.2.  The second estimate, the normal time, is the most realistic estimate of the time itwill take to do the step. In most cases, this percentage of occurrence will be higher than eitherof the other two estimates (difficult & easy) as it represents what normally happens. 9.4.5.2.3.  The third estimate, the easy time, is the shortest time that the step can be performedif everything goes well. 9.4.5.2.4.  After establishing the average unit time per step (per estimator), sum these averages(see Figure 9.1.) to attain the PAT per step for each process of the work center. 182AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003Figure 9.1.

Data Examination.  9.5.1.  When measurement has been completed, check frequencies and times with work center person-nel. 9.5.1.1.  Begin by checking measured activities and historical workload. 9.5.1.1.1.  Compare process frequencies with WLF counts. 9.5.1.1.2.  Compare frequencies of related steps. For example, the number of unit productionreports completed for each unit produced should relate to the number of units produced. 9.5.1.1.3.  When frequencies are generated by input from another work center or by productssent to another work center, check with the other work center. Frequency counts from thereceiving work center should match records of the sending work center. 9.5.1.1.4.  Compare PATs for similar steps. For example, time differences between preparing atype A report and a type B report should be justified by the characteristics of the reports. If not,question the measured times. 9.5.1.2.  Check all measurement data. Each process consists of a certain number of steps. Figure9.1. shows four estimates of the time needed to do each step. Estimates will vary for one reason oranother. Therefore, use the average or mean estimate as an expression of the time it takes to do astep. The average will likely be a more accurate estimate than any one of the four individual esti-mates. When an estimate for a particular step is unlike the other three estimates (Figure 9.1., step1, estimator 4), the measuring craftsman consults with the estimator and revises or discards it. Thecraftsman then calculates a new monthly average time for the step and records it on the AF Form1040. Once all of the steps in a process are analyzed in the above manner, add their averagestogether to get the average productive time for each process. 9.5.2.  Make sure that man-hours show all true requirements, not what was performed or what person-nel would like to do in excess of valid requirements. Historical data includes any mistakes or ineffi-AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003183ciencies of past operations. Past performance does not mean that the manpower was used to the bestadvantage or future work should be done under the same condition. 9.5.3.  Remember that each input will be analyzed by the study team and compared with all other inputmeasurements. Furnish supplemental forms and comments to aid the study team. If measurement dataappears inconsistent but has been verified based on specific characteristics of the work, relay thisinformation to the study team. If derived weighted averages were used, send the calculations to thestudy team. The overall quality of the study depends on the input team's measurement. 9.5.4.  Get the work center supervisor's concurrence or a specific, documented reason for nonconcur-rence. 9.5.5.  When SIAMs are used, brief the work center supervisor on the use of SIAMs to credit indirectman-hours. Chapter 13 gives details. 9.6.  Data Reporting.  9.6.1.  Automated spreadsheets that document the same basic information as required for completionof AF Forms 1040 are acceptable. Neat and legible handscribed forms are also acceptable. Preparationinstructions for the AF Form 1040 are in Table 9.1.. Use continuous calculations and round the lastanswer to the needed number of decimal places.

Use the same numeric identifiers and avoid unclear abbreviations. 5B  Whole number occurrence per time period that expresses the actual task frequency (e.g., 1/D1 for one per day for a five workday week). Activities that occur less than one time per year may be reflected as fractional frequencies (e.g., an activity occurring once every two years is shown as .5/YR). Reflect the expected natural rate of occurrence. For example, a quarterly report is shown as 1/QT, but an activity that occurs at four random times throughout the year is shown as 4/YR. Use frequency symbol from Table 9.2. Fractional frequencies may be used, if derived from historical records. 5C  Frequency code number from box 4 that corresponds with each activity. For example: For an activity frequency based on a 5-day workweek, enter "1." 5D  Applicable conversion factor from Table 9.2. 5E  Allowed time required to complete one occurrence of the activity. Express time in clock minutes. If time does not include allowances (good operator time), multiply by the appropriate allowance factor and enter the result.

Introduction to Functional Measures Development. All need to know how well they are doingtheir job. An improvement system that helps assess information important for the user is the best answer. 10.1.1.  AFI 90-1102, Performance Management, specifically outlines the Air Force’s construct for acontinual performance improvement process that focuses on the accomplishment of mission essentialtasks. Components of the Air Force Performance Management process covered in AFI 90-1102 aregoals, mission essential tasks (METs), performance measures, standards and targets, and task assur-ance. Although this chapter will not cover any aspect of the system outlined in AFI 90-1102, the Per-formance Management construct of “Plan, Do, Assess” applies to functional measures as well as anyother improvement system. 10.1.2.  This chapter covers the information any user needs to know to track functional measures. Thefunctional measures development process provides a useful feedback system for all people, especiallyat the lowest work center level. Work center personnel develop the assessment process themselves andgenerally use it to continually improve functional measures. The following critical elements arerequired when developing functional measures: 10.1.2.1.  Top level management supports the assessment process. 10.1.2.2.  Management identifies an individual who becomes familiar with the functional mea-sures development procedures, outlined in this chapter. This individual will lead work center per-sonnel through the functional measures development. 10.2.  Elements of the Functional Measures Tracking System (FMTS). These indicators are needed totrack performance in FMTS: 10.2.1.  Input - available monthly man-hours. 10.2.2.  Output - total output production or services completed each month. 10.2.3.  Efficiency - output divided by input. 10.2.4.  Unit man-hour cost - input divided by output. 10.2.5.  Effectiveness indicators furnish feedback information on the quality and timeliness of a workcenter's performance. Personnel should identify at least one effectiveness indicator for their work cen-ter. 10.3.  Systems Analysis.  10.3.1.  Factors influencing a work center are easy to understand if the work center is viewed as a sys-tem and analyzed as such. Figure 10.1. shows a system view of any work center or functional activity. 188AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003Figure 10.1.  Generalized Systems Diagram. 10.3.2.  The box in the center of the page represents the work center. This area includes the inputs andprocesses that produce the products or services that become outputs. The value-adding activities arethe processes the work center personnel use to transform the inputs into outputs. 10.3.3.  Each work center has customers for the products or services that become outputs. 10.3.3.1.  These customers may be internal to the organization that includes the work center. Inter-nal customers receive data or use the work center's output as an input for their value-adding activ-ities. 10.3.3.2.  The customers may be external to the work center's organization. 10.3.4.  Suppliers supply products or services to the work center. In this case, the work center is a cus-tomer of those suppliers. 10.3.5.  Customers have needs and expectations for the outputs of their suppliers. Customers decideon the quality of the output of their suppliers by how well the product or service satisfies their needsand expectations. The work center in this system acts both as a customer and supplier. This work cen-ter must satisfy its customers’ expectations and needs, just as it expects its suppliers to do the same. 10.3.6.  Customer needs will determine management's policy on the quality and timeliness for thework center's output. 10.3.7.  The work center personnel must have a means of determining how well they are meeting theneeds and expectations of their customers. They must also know how effectively their suppliers areAFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003189meeting their expectations. This can be done by identifying pertinent effectiveness indicators. Indica-tors can also be identified to monitor the work center's inputs, processes or value-adding activities,and outputs. 10.4.  Components of the Feedback System.  10.4.1.  Key Result Areas (KRA). These are the most critical selected areas of a function's responsi-bilities that, when monitored, state how well the work center is performing its mission requirements. 10.4.1.1.  A work center's mission statement identifies its responsibilities in the organization. Italso identifies what the work center has to do to support the organization's mission. Work centerpersonnel break their mission statement down into measurable components or KRAs. 10.4.1.2.  Select only the number of KRAs that give an adequate overview of the work center'sperformance. It's not necessary to monitor every process in a work center to know how well itsmission is being done. 10.4.2.  Functional Measures Indicators. These indicators show a work center's performance in termsof both efficiency and effectiveness. They serve to compare and evaluate effectiveness against estab-lished performance levels or goals. A good measurement system: 10.4.2.1.  Monitors KRAs of the work center's mission. Choose indicators that monitor the mostimportant needs of the work center's mission. Just one indicator may not give a true picture of awork center's overall performance. Therefore, select the minimum number of indicators that satis-factorily furnish a useful reflection of the work center's efforts. 10.4.2.2.  Is easily understood by all function personnel. All indicators should be logical andmeaningful to work center personnel. 10.4.2.3.  Can be controlled by the work center's actions. That is, actions taken by work center per-sonnel should be shown by a change in input, output, efficiency, effectiveness, or unit man-hourcost indicators. This does not mean that work center personnel should be able to make the indica-tors say what they want them to say. But the indicators should show when a measurable changehas taken place in a work center. Significant changes (positive or negative) should cause the super-visor to ask "why." Corrective action may be necessary depending on the causes identified as aresult of a review. These readings are primarily a feedback tool so the supervisor and his peoplecan assess the work center's performance for a given period of time. Work center personnel canthen evaluate policies and procedures, job assignments, and worker performance. 10.4.2.4.  Includes indicators that show efficiency and effectiveness. Functional measures indica-tors should track how efficiently a work center is operating and how effectively it is meeting itsmission requirements. 10.4.2.5.  Can evaluate change. Effectiveness indicators should help management evaluate goalsor standards. If an indicator does not show any noticeable change, it may no longer be useful.Also, if an indicator that has been monitored (over a period of time) levels off at an acceptablelevel to management and appears to have stabilized, work center personnel can select anothermore critical indicator in its place. 10.4.2.6.  Includes indicators that are useful and cost efficient. Indicators should track the major ormost representative needs of the work center. However, do not choose an indicator whose cost, intime and effort to get data, is greater than its value for showing the work center's performance.190AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003When possible, use existing reporting systems to extract needed data. If reporting systems are notavailable, work center personnel should develop interim procedures to aid future collection of theneeded data. 10.4.3.  Mission Effectiveness Charts. Mission effectiveness charts offer a means of developing apotentially nonlinear association between levels of performance shown by an effectiveness indicatorwith effectiveness points. Work center personnel first identify effectiveness indicators and then asso-ciate point values for different levels of performance shown by the indicators. One mission effective-ness chart is developed for each effectiveness indicator. 10.5.  The Workshop Facilitation Process. The work center should be viewed as part of a system toshow the interactions of the work center with its customers and suppliers. The systems view of the workcenter assures that all needed elements for performance feedback are covered. The information necessaryfor the performance feedback system should be developed in a workshop environment. All necessaryinformation can be obtained in the workshop used for an Air Force Process Oriented Review. If functionalmeasures are not developed as part of a Process Oriented Review, two different workshops should beheld. 10.5.1.  The first workshop consists of upper-level management and immediate subordinates. Forexample, in a Base Supply organization the workshop members would be composed of the com-mander, his branch chiefs, and the workshop facilitator. This group identifies customers and checkscurrent mission statements to identify KRAs for the subordinate work centers. 10.5.2.  The second workshop consists of the branch chiefs from the first workshop, his or her workcenter supervisors, and key workers. This group reviews the product of the first workshop and modi-fies it, if necessary. This group then develops functional measures indicators and associated missioneffectiveness charts for their work centers. 10.6.  The Nominal Group Technique. The facilitator works with the work center representatives andmanagement, in a workshop environment, to identify work center customers, KRAs, efficiency and effec-tiveness indicators, and mission effectiveness charts. These elements can be identified using a provenapproach called the Nominal Group Technique. This technique is a useful problem-solving and idea-gen-erating strategy. The process begins with the workshop facilitator discussing each step of the process tothe workshop participants. The nominal group technique is controlled by the facilitator and includes thesesteps: silent generation, round robin listing, clarification, and voting and ranking. These steps aredescribed below for identifying the KRAs. These same steps may be used to identify work center custom-ers and functional measures indicators. 10.6.1.  Silent Generation. 10.6.1.1.  The silent generation step typically takes about 10 minutes. During this step, the facili-tator writes a carefully worded task statement: WHAT IS THE PRIMARY SERVICE OR PRODUCT OF THIS WORK CENTER? Each participant responds to this task statement during the structured group session. It is perhapsthe most critical element of the nominal group technique. The task statement is simple, direct, andaddresses the subject being pursued. Tell workshop participants to write their responses to the taskstatement on a sheet of paper. Good opening task statements when developing effectiveness indi-cators are: Our task is to develop an indicator that will allow us to decide if the work center isAFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003191achieving the performance level desired, to determine what quantitative indicators the work centerpersonnel should track on a monthly basis, and to tell if the work center's mission is being effec-tively accomplished. 10.6.1.2.  If the facilitator is asked what is meant by the task statement, it is best to avoid introduc-ing bias by giving examples. Instead, the facilitator might ask several of the participants to givetheir interpretation of the task statement. If the responses appear to meet the objective and theremainder of the participants grasp the task, it is all right to proceed. 10.6.1.3.  Even if most participants appear to stop writing before 10 minutes are up, do not shortenthe period. If some talking occurs, the facilitator should tactfully ask for cooperation in letting oth-ers think through and record their ideas. 10.6.1.4.  Like each of the steps in the nominal group technique, silence is an important element.Research has shown that for generating ideas, individuals are more effective than groups. Silentgeneration focuses attention on a specific task, frees participants from distractions, and gives theman opportunity to think through their ideas rather than to simply react, thus yielding inputs ofgreater quality and variety. Participants are motivated by the tension of seeing those around themworking hard at the group task. They are forced to pay attention to the task longer, rather than con-sidering the first input suggested to the group. They are freed from all of the inhibiting effects ofthe usual face-to-face interaction of unstructured groups. 10.6.1.5.  When the 10 minutes are up, the facilitator interrupts the silent generation process.(NOTE: Additional ideas may also be produced for use following silent generation.) 10.6.2.  Round Robin Listing. 10.6.2.1.  The facilitator calls on participants, in turn, to read one of their written responses. Par-ticipants may pass at any time and may also join in on any later round. A participant may proposeonly one item at a time, and either the facilitator or an assistant records each item as it is offered.The only discussion allowed is between the facilitator and the participant who proposed the item.The discussion is limited to seeking a concise rephrasing for recording. As each participantresponds, the facilitator repeats exactly what has been said, and the assistant records the concisephrase on a sheet. The facilitator may help rephrasing to maintain consistency and achieve sessiongoals as long as the basic idea or concept is not altered. This phase goes on until all the ideas pro-duced by the group are listed and displayed. Judgment of ideas should not take place during thisearly and crucial portion of the group process. 10.6.2.2.  This round robin listing step allows the leader to establish an atmosphere of acceptanceand trust. He or she does not unduly rephrase or evaluate the contributions. All responses areequally and prominently displayed before the group. Leader openness and nonevaluative behaviorare essential here. Make sure each idea and each participant receives equal attention and accep-tance. The process separates ideas from their authors and lets conflicting and incompatible ideasbe considered. This step furnishes a written record of the group’s efforts and makes later docu-mentation easier. 10.6.3.  Clarification of Responses. 10.6.3.1.  Once all the items have been recorded, the facilitator calls on the author of each item tooffer clarification if needed. This is done so that the other participants understand the item as it hasbeen recorded. During this step, the logic behind items is brought out. Differences of opinion may192AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003be expressed, but only the author of an item can decide if it can be eliminated or joined withanother item because it duplicates others. 10.6.3.2.  The facilitator keeps the group moving rapidly through the list of items. While the groupmembers are clarifying their ideas with the facilitator, he should control lengthy discussions, argu-ments, and speech making. Again, the effort is to separate ideas from their authors, to clarifyrather than to evaluate, and to ensure full opportunities for participation. 10.6.3.3.  The clarification aspect of the nominal group technique has the most impact on the qual-ity of the resulting list of items. If there is a great deal of overlap from item to item and if the groupmembers don't understand what each item means, the next step, voting and ranking, will beinvalid. Experience has shown that a certain amount of idea combination is necessary. Carefulcombining or subtle clarifying during the round robin step helps alleviate clarification difficulties. 10.6.4.  Voting and Ranking. 10.6.4.1.  This final step gives participants an opportunity to select the most important items andrank them. The items should be visible to all workshop members, either on a chalkboard or largepad of paper. Give the participants blank "3 x 5" cards. The number can vary. If five cards areused, ask each participant to select the five most important items from the list in front of them. Atypical list may have 15 to 20 items. To avoid any confusion, ask participants to write the items outin the center of the blank card. Also ask them to write the item numbers in the upper left-hand cor-ner. After this is done, have them spread the five cards out in front of them and follow the nextsteps that are designed to rank and weigh the items. 10.6.4.1.1.  Tell the participants to choose the most important item from the five cards, writethe number 5 with a circle around it in the lower right-hand corner of the card, and set the cardaside. Another way of phrasing this is “Which of the five items would you select if you couldonly use one?” 10.6.4.1.2.  Then say, "From the remaining four cards, choose the least important item, writethe number 1 with a circle around it in the lower right-hand corner of the card, and set the cardaside." Another way of phrasing this is "If you could only use three of the four items in frontof you, which one item would you throw away?" 10.6.4.1.3.  Then state, "From the remaining three cards, choose the most important item, writethe number 4 with a circle around it in the lower right-hand corner to the card, and set the cardaside." 10.6.4.1.4.  Finally, have the participants choose the least important of the remaining two cardsand have them write the number 2 with a circle around it in the lower right-hand corner of thecard. The remaining card will be numbered with a circled 3. 10.6.4.2.  Tabulate the Results. Sort the cards by item number from the original list and record theweights given to each. Display individual weights to show the number of weights given and theirvariation. This step allows the functional representatives to present their evaluations free of peerpressure. For an example of results, see Figure 10.2.. Select no more than the top five KRAs iden-tified by the tabulation results. These KRAs are then checked for possible effectiveness indicators.Remember, if this is a process-oriented review workshop, the participants will identify anddevelop the effectiveness indicators. If the feedback system is being developed separately, the sec-AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003193ond group identified in paragraph 10.5.2. will identify and develop the effectiveness indicators fortheir work centers.

Developing a Functional Measures Indicator.  10.7.1.  After the workshop participants agree on the KRAs that should be monitored, they decide thebest functional measures indicators for each area. 10.7.2.  Use care when developing indicators to distinguish between those that address efficiency(output or input) and those that show effectiveness (quality, timeliness, etc.). 194AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 200310.7.2.1.  Efficiency is defined as the ratio of outputs produced to inputs consumed. Input can beunit man-hours, capital, or material. We'll limit our input to available man-hours. For example:Base Supply Parts Issue Section issued 21,000 items during January, using 840 man-hours. Output =  21,000 Items   = 25 Items Issued Per Man-hour  Input        840  Man-hours The result (25) represents the efficiency factor for January.  Taken by itself, the number is of little use.  But, by comparing it to another time period like the previous month (December) for a base-line yield of 16,000 items in 800 hours or 20 items per hour, January's man-hour efficiency was 25 percent higher (25/20) than the previous month. 10.7.2.2.  Another way of treating the output-input relationship is to divide the man-hours used bythe output produced to derive unit cost.   Dec  Input =   800   = .050 Man-hours/item issued              Output    16,000   Jan  Input =   840   = .040 Man-hours/item issued             Output   21,000 10.7.2.3.  Effectiveness indicators measure goal attainment, timeliness, quality, etc., and theirimpact on customers of other functions and organizations. Effectiveness is defined as the ratio ofsuccessful events or accomplishments to total accomplishments, a predetermined goal, standard,or baseline. Some examples are: 10.7.2.3.1.  Quality. A functional OPR's goal is to maintain a first-time, right-part issue rate ofno less than 99.5%. During January, 75 items were returned due to Issue Section errors. Theresulting 99.6% rate, therefore, was still acceptable.        Quality = (21,000 - 75)/21,000(100) = 99.6% 10.7.2.3.2.  Timeliness. Another possible goal of work center personnel is to reduce walk-incustomer waiting time from its FY 99 average of 15 minutes to 10 minutes or less. By puttingsome of the high-use items closer to the counter, leasing computerized optical scan equipment,and asking the customers to complete certain portions of the request document before reachingthe counter, the average waiting time dropped to just 5 minutes per customer in this example. 10.7.2.4.  Other indicators include, but are not limited to: readiness, reliability, accuracy, safety,security, maintainability, survivability, mobility, sustainability, and flexibility. AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 200319510.8.  Mission Effectiveness Charts. Mission effectiveness charts allow work center personnel to trans-form the values earned by effectiveness indicators into effectiveness points. This transformation sets thework center's policy on how important different values earned by an effectiveness indicator is to the workcenter personnel. The transformation also weighs the importance of different effectiveness indicators. 10.8.1.  Developing Mission Effectiveness Charts. 10.8.1.1.  Developing mission effectiveness charts, like developing KRAs and indicators, needsconsensus among members of the workshop. These charts are developed in the Process OrientedReview workshop. If the feedback system is not developed as part of a process-oriented review,these charts are developed in the second workshop discussed in paragraph 10.5.. See Figure 10.3.for a blank Mission Effectiveness Chart. To facilitate developing the mission effectiveness chart,certain information for each effectiveness indicator is needed when it is first identified anddefined. This adds a refinement step to the indicator development process discussed previously. Itis better to refine indicators at this first stage of developing indicators rather than later, becauseworkshop members have recently completed identifying and defining indicators and will have aclear understanding of their meaning. If this refinement is deferred, some members of the work-shop may forget important details about the indicators. Figure 10.3.  General Form of the Mission Effectiveness Chart. 10.8.1.2.  The facilitator should lead the workshop members to a consensus on the answers to threequestions for each indicator. The first two questions to be used to refine each indicator are as fol-lows: IF EVERYTHING GOES RIGHT FOR YOUR ORGANIZATION OR WORK CENTER, WHATIS THE "FEASIBLE BEST" YOU COULD DO ON THIS INDICATOR? 196AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003IF EVERYTHING GOES WRONG FOR YOUR ORGANIZATION OR WORK CENTER,WHAT IS THE "FEASIBLE WORST" YOU COULD DO ON THIS INDICATOR? This pair of values constitutes the best and worst performance possible, considering real-worldorganizational constraints and environmental peculiarities (see Figure 10.4.). Figure 10.4.  Feasible Best and Worst Locations on the Mission Effectiveness Chart. 10.8.1.3.  The facilitator should make sure that workshop members understand that "feasible" bestand worst are not the same as "absolute" best and worst. For instance, consider this indicator forcustomer satisfaction: number of customer inquiries satisfied/number of customer inquiriesreceived (monthly) x 100. The absolute or arithmetic best would be 100%, meaning that all inquir-ies received are satisfied. This may, however, not be the feasible best if workshop membersbelieve that they regularly receive a few inquiries that can't be satisfied regardless of how hardthey try. The feasible best may, thus, be only 95% or even 90%.       The third question to ask is: BETWEEN THE FEASIBLE BEST AND FEASIBLE WORST, WHAT IS THE LEVEL, POINT,OR ZONE OF PERFORMANCE ON THIS INDICATOR THAT IS NOT GOOD OR NOT BAD,THAT IS THE "BREAK-EVEN" OR "DON'T ROCK THE BOAT" POINT? The facilitator should tell the workshop members that this is also the safety, expected, or normalperformance point. That is, this is the point where the work center supervisor will neither becomeconcerned that performance is too low and commit more resources, nor feel that performance is sogood that the work center should be recognized for outstanding effort. 10.8.1.4.  For instance, in terms of the customer satisfaction indicator example above, membersmay feel that satisfying 8 of 10 customer inquiries (80%) would be neither bad nor good. That is,the group may believe that the supervisor will become concerned if performance falls below 80%,but that if performance rises above 80%, the supervisor will begin to recognize that the work cen-AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003197ter is doing a good job. On the other hand, the group may believe that there is no single normalperformance point, but instead, there is a range of expected performance represented by a zone of,say, from 75% to 85%. In other words, they believe that the supervisor is not concerned in a zoneof 75% to 85% but will become concerned if the percentage falls below 75% or be impressed if thepercentage rises above 85%. 10.8.2.  Weighting Indicators. 10.8.2.1.  The next step is for the facilitator to point out to workshop members the likelihood thattheir indicators are not of equal importance. The facilitator should use several simple examples tobring out this point. For instance, in assessing the overall performance of a baseball team, whichof these indicators would be of greater interest to the team manager: number of home runs hit ornumber of bats broken? In a military communications/navigation equipment repair shop, wouldthe supervisor be more interested in "radios and radars returned from the flight line for failure towork properly (bounce rate)" or "number of dental checkup appointments missed by personnel?"In answering this second question, remember that although missing dental appointments is seri-ous, the bounce rate directly affects flying capability and is, therefore, of critical interest to thewing commander, whose success depends in large part on getting aircraft into the air. (NOTE: Theanswers are, of course, that the baseball manager is more interested in home runs and the supervi-sor is more concerned about the bounce rate.) Getting workshop members to achieve consensus onthe relative importance of their indicators is the next step in developing mission effectivenesscharts. Use an Indicator Weighting Table to identify the relative importance of indicators. (SeeFigure 10.5.). 198AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003Figure 10.5.  Format for an Indicator Weighting Table.

On the left-hand side of the Indicator Weighting Table, the facilitator writes the KRAand indicators that were developed for the work center under study. The KRAs and the indicatorsthat measure KRA accomplishment form the rows of the table. At the top of the table, the facilita-tor enters the column headings shown in Figure 10.5.. For the first and fourth columns, the facili-tator writes, for each indicator, the feasible best and feasible worst values derived earlier in theprocess of refining indicators. The facilitator should remind workshop members that these feasiblebest and worst values are their own judgments and are different from the absolute (arithmetic) bestand worst. 10.8.2.3.  In the example shown in Figure 10.5., there are three KRAs and five indicators. Foreach indicator there is a corresponding set of feasible best and worst values shown in columns (1)and (4). For Indicator #1, workshop members said in the indicator refinement stage that the feasi-ble best the work center could do in satisfying inquiries was 95%; they believed that some pecu-liarity would always prevent their achieving 100%. They said the feasible worst was 50%. OnIndicator #2, the feasible best and worst in terms of number of complaints received were zero andfive, respectively; and so on for the feasible best and worst for the other three indicators. 10.8.2.4.  Once the facilitator has entered all feasible best and worst values in columns (1) and (4),the next step is to complete column (2) of the Indicator Weighting Table. Column 2 is used torecord the consensus judgment of the workshop members as to the relative importance or rank ofeach feasible best value of the indicators. To identify ranks of the feasible best values for column(2), the facilitator says: SUPPOSE EVERYTHING IMAGINABLE GOES RIGHT FOR THE WORK CENTER FOR AGIVEN MEASUREMENT PERIOD. YOU ARE STAFFED AT 100 PERCENT. LITTLE SICKAFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003199OR ANNUAL LEAVE IS TAKEN. THERE ARE NO READINESS EXERCISES. OTHERORGANIZATIONS YOU WORK WITH ARE COOPERATIVE. BECAUSE OF THESE ANDOTHER POSITIVE INFLUENCES, THE WORK CENTER PERFORMS AT ITS FEASIBLEBEST ON ALL INDICATORS. THE WORK CENTER PERFORMS AT 95% ON CUSTOMERINQUIRIES SATISFIED, 0 ON CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS, AND SO ON. IF THIS WERETRUE, WHICH OF THE FIVE FEASIBLE BESTS WOULD HAVE THE GREATEST POSI-TIVE EFFECT ON THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE (MISSION) OF THE WORK CENTER? Workshop members then discuss alternative answers to this question until the members reach con-sensus on which indicator is the most important when all show the feasible best value. This indi-cator is ranked one and a "1" is entered in column (2) for that indicator. (In the Figure 10.5.example, the most important feasible best was that for Indicator #4.) In case of ties between two ormore indicators, each of the tied indicators will be assigned the same rank. For instance, if twoindicators will equally result in the greatest positive impact, both should receive the rank of one.The facilitator continues: NOW THAT YOU HAVE IDENTIFIED THE INDICATOR WHOSE FEASIBLE BEST VALUEHAS THE GREATEST POSITIVE IMPACT, WHICH OF THE REMAINING INDICATORS’FEASIBLE BEST HAS THE SECOND GREATEST POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE OVERALLPERFORMANCE OF THE WORK CENTER? This indicator is ranked two and a "2" is marked in the proper row of column (2). (In Figure10.5.Indicator #5 is ranked 2). The process continues with workshop members ranking the impor-tance of the feasible best on the remaining indicators. 10.8.2.5.  After the feasible bests have been ranked in column (2), the facilitator asks workshopmembers to change these ranks to effectiveness points for column (3), and says: IF WE AUTOMATICALLY ASSIGN 100 EFFECTIVENESS POINTS TO THE FEASIBLEBEST FOR THE INDICATOR YOU RANKED FIRST, AS HAVING THE GREATEST POSI-TIVE MISSION IMPACT, HOW MUCH LESS IS THE IMPACT ON THE OVERALL MIS-SION OF THE INDICATOR WHOSE FEASIBLE BEST YOU RANKED SECOND? The facilitator then explains that if the indicator ranked second were only about half as importantto the mission as the indicator ranked first, it would be assigned 50 effectiveness points. If it wereconsidered three-fourths as important, it would receive 75 points. If its impact was almost asimportant as that of the indicator ranked first, an effectiveness rating of 95 or 98 points might beassigned. This process continues until all indicator ranks in column (2) have been transformed toeffectiveness points and recorded in column (3). 10.8.2.6.  For the indicators shown in Figure 10.5., Indicator #4 (with the rank of one) automati-cally received 100 effectiveness points. Indicator #5 (with the rank of two) was judged to have90% as positive an impact on the work center's effectiveness as Indicator #4 and was thus assigned90 effectiveness points. Finally, Indicators #1, #2, and #3 were tied in column (2) at the rank ofthree, and workshop members agree that these indicators should receive 75 effectiveness pointseach. 10.8.2.7.  A similar process is then performed to find the ranks (column 5) and effectiveness points(column 6) of the feasible worst values of the indicators. The facilitator begins this process ofranking with workshop members as follows: 200AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003SUPPOSE EVERYTHING GOES WRONG FOR THE WORK CENTER FOR A GIVEN MEA-SUREMENT PERIOD. YOUR MANNING LEVEL IS VERY LOW. THERE IS A BIG SNOW-STORM. THERE IS AN UNEXPECTED READINESS EXERCISE. THE MOON IS FULL.MORALE IS LOW AND THE WORK CENTER WORKS AT ITS FEASIBLE WORST ONALL 5 INDICATORS. IF THIS WERE TRUE, WHICH OF THE INDICATORS WOULD HAVETHE GREATEST NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE (MISSION) OFTHE WORK CENTER? WHICH LOW SCORE WOULD HURT YOU THE MOST? The feasible worst values are ranked in column (5) with "1" for the indicator with the greatest neg-ative impact; again, ties are possible. As shown in column (5) of Figure 10.5., the workshop mem-bers judged that Indicator #4 would have the greatest negative impact; Indicator #5, the secondgreatest negative impact; Indicator #3, the third; Indicator #2, the fourth; and Indicator #1, thefifth. 10.8.2.8.  The next step is to transform the ranks in column (5) to negative effectiveness points incolumn (6). Though the feasible worst will usually receive -100 effectiveness points, the auto-matic assignment of -100 is not absolutely necessary. For instance, in the case of Indicator #4 inFigure 10.5. (which was ranked one for having the greatest negative impact on the work center),workshop members believe that this indicator was simply not as bad as -100. They saw a differ-ence in the impact on the work center's effectiveness (mission) between the feasible best and worston this indicator. They believed that -90 was the impact of the feasible worst; therefore, -90 wasrecorded in column (6) for Indicator #4. 10.8.2.9.  Once the negative effectiveness point rating is decided for the indicator ranked numberone, the process continues, with members coming to consensus regarding the ratings for theremaining indicators. In the Figure 10.5. example, workshop members decide that the next feasi-ble worst indicator (#5) should receive -80 effectiveness points and that the other three indicators(#3, #2, and #1) should be assigned effectiveness points of -75, -70, and -50, respectively. 10.8.2.10.  Note that the effectiveness points for the feasible best values are always positive (e.g.,100, 90, and 75), and the effectiveness points for the feasible worst values are always negative(e.g., -90, -80, -75, -70, and -50). If a work center has only one indicator, its feasible best isassigned 100 effectiveness points and its feasible worst is assigned -100 effectiveness points. 10.8.3.  Plotting Known Values for Mission Effectiveness Charts. 10.8.3.1.  After refining the indicators and assigning relative weights to each, as suggested previ-ously, the facilitator proceeds to the last step in developing a mission effectiveness chart for eachindicator. He helps workshop members identify the slopes of the curves for each chart. The facili-tator begins by showing members how to plot the previously determined values on the chart. 10.8.3.2.  The general form of a mission effectiveness chart is shown in Figure 10.3.. The verticalaxis of a mission effectiveness chart shows an indicator's overall effectiveness or mission impactand is scaled from -100 through 0 to +100 in increments of ten. The vertical axis is the same for allmission effectiveness charts. The horizontal axis is used to record those values specific to a givenindicator; these values will range from the feasible worst to the feasible best for that particularindicator. It is recommended that the facilitator prepare a transparency of the chart for use on anoverhead projector to help in plotting these values. 10.8.3.3.  Using a transparency of the chart from Figure 10.3., as an example, the facilitator tellsworkshop members that they are at last ready to construct a mission effectiveness chart for theirAFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003201Indicator #1, "Customer Satisfaction." The facilitator further explains that this chart will serve asa vehicle for providing feedback to them on their performance for this indicator. He also showshow their level of performance impacts the overall performance (mission) of the work centeraccording to the values earned on the vertical axis. 10.8.3.4.  Workshop members are then shown that they made some important decisions about thechart when they defined the feasible best and worst for the indicator, in that these values representthe "end-points" of its horizontal axis. The facilitator labels the horizontal axis with the name ofthe indicator in question. He then marks the feasible best as the point (to the right) on the horizon-tal axis, and the feasible worst as the point (to the left) on the horizontal axis. 10.8.3.5.  Next, the facilitator fills in the intervals along the horizontal axis between the feasibleworst and the feasible best. When under pressure to keep the process going, the facilitator mayfind it difficult to precisely scale between the two extremes, but workshop members will be under-standing and satisfied with a series of approximations. Later, when the mission effectivenesscharts are automated or typed, an exact horizontal scale can be developed and the entire missioneffectiveness chart can be presented for workshop review. Figure 10.6. shows such a scaling ofthe horizontal axis of Indicator #1 from Figure 10.5.. Figure 10.6.  Customer Satisfaction Mission Effectiveness Chart with Horizontal Axis Scaled. 10.8.3.6.  Next, the facilitator tells workshop members that they have already developed threepoints for the mission effectiveness chart that represent three levels of performance on the indica-tor. These points are the normal performance point (or range) and effectiveness values for the fea-sible worst and best discussed previously. 10.8.3.7.  Figure 10.7. shows these three parts of the curve for the Figure 10.5. example. For thisparticular example, workshop members decided earlier that the range from 75 to 85 would repre-sent the expected performance, (i.e., 0 effectiveness 5, 80, and 85). This example is plotted in Fig-ure 10.7.. 202AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003Figure 10.7.  Normal Performance Range, Feasible Worst and Feasible Best Data Points Plotted for Customer Satisfaction. 10.8.3.8.  Before asking workshop members to plot the intermediate points for its first chart, thefacilitator should furnish and interpret several alternative mission effectiveness chart curves toillustrate the concept. Figure 10.8. shows two such alternatives (a dashed-line curve and asolid-line curve), as applied to the three plotted values presented in Figure 10.7.. AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003203Figure 10.8.  Alternative Slopes of Mission Effectiveness Charts for Customer Satisfaction. 10.8.3.9.  The dashed-line curve suggests that a very broad range of performance on the indicator(from 55% to 94% inquiries satisfied) has no positive or negative impact on mission, in that theeffectiveness points vary only from -10 to 10. Performance above or below this range, however,has a substantial impact on the mission (75 and -50 effectiveness points, respectively). 10.8.3.10.  The solid-line curve in Figure 10.8. exhibits a very different pattern. According to thiscurve, immediately below the normal performance range (less than 75% inquiries satisfied) themission impact becomes severe, falling from 0 to almost -50 effectiveness points for a mere differ-ence of 5% in indicator performance. Below the 70% level, however, the impact is already so badthat it can get only slightly worse. On the positive side, when performance exceeds the normal per-formance range (greater than 85%), the positive impact on the mission is dramatic; that is, anincrease from 85% to 90% inquiries satisfied produces an increase in effectiveness points from 0to almost 75. Above the 90% level, the increase in mission impact is positive, but small by com-parison. As part of the instruction about these alternatives, the facilitator should stress to work-shop members that the slope of the curve is a graphic expression of their policy about therelationship between performance on the indicator and the impact on mission of various levels ofperformance expressed in effectiveness points. 10.8.3.11.  Workshop members learn to come to consensus quickly about the shape of curves formission effectiveness charts, but the facilitator may wish to begin developing the first chart byasking questions such as these: IF THE IMPACT ON OVERALL EFFECTIVENESS OF 75% TO 85% INQUIRIES SATISFIEDIS ZERO EFFECTIVENESS POINTS, HOW MUCH BETTER IS IT TO HAVE 90% OFINQUIRIES SATISFIED? HOW MUCH WORSE IS IT TO HAVE ONLY 70% SATISFIED,65% SATISFIED, 60% SATISFIED, ETC.? 204AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003Answers to each question form data points that, when connected, result in the mission effective-ness curve. Not every point on the X-axis needs to be addressed. Only those points that show achange in slope. 10.8.3.12.  After the mission effectiveness chart for the first indicator is completed, the facilitatorguides workshop members in a similar manner, completing the mission effectiveness charts for theremaining indicators. 10.8.4.  Checking Mission Effectiveness Charts. 10.8.4.1.  Before the facilitator submits the feedback system to management for review, membersof the workshop should conduct two "sanity checks" of their mission effectiveness charts to makesure that the charts are both accurate and logical. The first check should come immediately afterthe charts are put into the form that they will be used for providing feedback to workers and man-agement. (This form can range from a fully automated procedure on a computer to simple typedcopies that are photocopied for each measurement period.) At this time, workshop membersshould check their charts to make sure that all elements have been recorded and reproduced asoriginally specified. 10.8.4.2.  Another meeting to correct and change charts should take place when actual perfor-mance results on indicators are available from the first measurement period. At this stage, work-shop members should feel free to change their mission effectiveness charts in any way necessary. 10.8.4.3.  Besides improving the quality of charts, these meetings offer the added benefit of get-ting organization members into the habit of meeting to discuss their charts. Once the feedback sys-tem is in full operation, monthly meetings to check performance on mission effectiveness chartsare essential and are the most powerful feature of this process. Feedback is widely believed to bethe most important motivation to the improvement of performance. Monthly feedback meetingsare also used to identify constraints to performance and to discuss "how to work smarter." 10.8.5.  Using Mission Effectiveness Charts. 10.8.5.1.  A mission effectiveness chart is developed for each effectiveness indicator. Two chartsshowing a work center policy on "Return Rate of Equipment" and "Inspections Passed" are shownin Figure 10.9.. The most important of the two indicators is the one for return rate. The slope ofthe curve on this chart is much steeper and has a greater range than the one for inspections passed.Its point value at feasible best is 100 while at feasible worst is -80. For inspections passed, thepoints earned for feasible best is 20 and for feasible worst is -80. Therefore, there is a greaterimpact, in point value, for a change in performance in return rate than for inspections passed. AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003205Figure 10.9.  Examples of Mission Effectiveness Charts. 10.8.5.2.  A reading is taken for each indicator in a particular month, and its value is read on theX-axis. A vertical line from that reading will intersect the curve and give a point value along theY-axis. Readings from all the effectiveness charts can be added together to get an overall effective-ness score for the month as shown in Figure 10.10.. This score can be compared in time with thescore obtained in the baseline period to decide if there has been an improvement. 206AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003Figure 10.10.  Example of Summing Effectiveness Scores. INDICATOR    EFFECTIVENESS DATA               SCORE            90                   +9             8                   +30                                  +39 10.8.6.  Options for Using the Range of Normal Performance. Work center personnel may identify arange of indicator values that they consider representative of normal or expected performance. If thisis the case, there are three approaches that can be used to furnish feedback to personnel as shown inFigure 10.11.. AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003207Figure 10.11.  Options for the Range of Normal Performance. 10.8.6.1.  In option #1, performance is represented horizontally showing a range of normal perfor-mance. In this case there is no warning to work center personnel when a negative trend begins. Weare not concerned about a change in performance within this range and none is shown. 10.8.6.2.  In option #2, a slight turn is made at the ends of this range to show a change in perfor-mance in both positive and negative directions. We now gain an early warning of a change in per-208AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003formance within the expected performance range and are able to correct a problem within theoperation and stop a significant negative turn before it becomes a major problem. 10.8.6.3.  In option #3, the work center rates along the entire range of normal performance. Theslope of this range should be slight, 5 or 10 points in either direction. Just enough to give an indi-cation of a trend. In effect, we wind up with a point of expected performance at the center of thisrange and an early indication of a potential problem. 10.9.  Presentation of Functional Measurement Indicator Feedback.  10.9.1.  Local managers should be able to use this information to investigate the impact of manage-ment decisions they or higher-level managers make on a monthly basis. This allows faster feedback, amore rapid implementation of new ideas, and modification of procedures in work centers where per-formance is below established, acceptable levels. 10.9.2.  Indicators in a work center can be rolled-up for branch-level and top management-levelreview. Assure that the efficiency indicators are rolled up together and that effectiveness indicators arerolled up together. Each higher-management level would receive one efficiency indicator and oneeffectiveness indicator that show the performance of the subordinate work centers. One approach forrolling up data is to sum the changes of the individual indicator values for the work centers. Thechanges are obtained by comparing the value earned by an indicator for a particular month to the valueearned in the baseline month or year. Assuming that 100% is a baseline level, each work center is ofequal importance, and three separate work centers have these performance percentages:              Work Center  Percentage     Change                           A          110%         +10                           B            80%          -20                           C          140%         +40                                Change Total =  +30 Add the changes for a total of +30. This total is then added to 100% for a composite result. This resultcan then be monitored by work center personnel to compare the level of achievement in relation toestablished goals or past results. If the three work centers above were not of equal importance, suitablefactors would be developed to scale the work centers to their level of importance before adding thechanges together. If the same type of activity is present in several installations, subordinate work cen-ter performance can be rolled up to the organization level at each installation. This information couldthen be rolled up to the relevant command for review. The values for each command can be summedand used by the Air Staff OPR to evaluate changes in policy, procedures, and effectiveness of guid-AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003209ance in relation to established goals or past performance. Also, this data can be used to develop por-tions of the annual Federal Productivity Report for the function. 10.9.3.  An example is shown here of how the minimum feedback data could be presented for the BaseSupply Parts Issue Section at a base, a command, and Air Staff. The only limits on the approaches topresent the data are your creativity and the available computer hardware and software. 10.9.3.1.  Base Level. Furnish a monthly count of the work center's available man-hours and out-put to find the efficiency and unit man-hour cost indicators. Supply data for effectiveness indica-tors to identify how well the work center is meeting established standards or goals or performingin comparison to a baseline period. Figure 10.12. shows six months of data for a branch. Twoeffectiveness counts are included, one for the number of rejects and the other for delivery time.The first four report entries (that is, input, output, efficiency, and unit man-hour cost), use themonth of June as the baseline month. The last two entries; issue rate quality and delivery time areeffectiveness entries and are compared to an established goal or a baseline month. Figure 10.13.shows a graphic presentation of these indicators. Several indicators may be displayed together(input, output, efficiency, and unit man-hour cost indicators) as shown in the top graph of Figure10.13., or each indicator can be displayed by itself (time of delivery) as shown in the lower graphof Figure 10.13.. Use the method that gets the information across to management most effectively.NOTE: All lines in Figure 10.13. begin at the baseline level of 100 in the baseline month of June.The value of each indicator in June establishes the baseline and later month indicator values arecompared to the baseline month and percentage changes noted on the graph. If mission effective-ness charts are used, the effectiveness points earned each month are compared to the baselinemonth point values and the changes plotted. Remember that while graphically portrayed increasesare usually associated with improvement, an increase for indicators such as cost or time might sig-nal that action is needed.

Graphic Presentation of Performance Data. 10.9.3.2.  Major Command Level. Every quarter the command OPR can view the functional mea-sures indicators for functions at each base in the command. One approach of rolling up the data tothe mid-level OPR is to sum the data for each indicator every month and take an average for thequarter. The first quarter of data becomes the baseline quarter. Each later quarter is shown as a per-centage deviation from the baseline quarter. As in the base-level presentations, one efficiency andAFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003211one effectiveness indicator is used to show the overall performance of each command organizationin graphic form. 10.9.3.3.  Air Staff Level. The same process can be used semiannually (or annually) to roll up theperformance of the MAJCOMs to develop a composite count and presentation for the Air StaffOPR. If semiannual reporting is desired, the data (using the two most current quarters) for eachindicator is summed, averaged, and presented. The Air Staff OPR views the baseline deviationsfor the 6-month period for each indicator. 10.10.  Implementing and Using the Feedback System for Continuous Improvement.  10.10.1.  The complete system of KRAs, indicators, and charts is briefed to higher management.Because this process maintains and supports the prerogatives of traditional management, the facilita-tor should make sure that some cautions are observed in this approval process. 10.10.2.  The facilitator should prebrief the manager to reaffirm the basic philosophy of the process. Akey point of implementation is that the greatest gain in organizational performance comes fromincreasing worker motivation and restoring or increasing workers' pride in their work and sense ofcraftsmanship. These factors are especially important in a resource-constrained environment. In anycase, management should be reminded that workers must feel a sense of ownership of their functionalmeasures feedback system if its feedback component is to be motivational. Workers "buy into thefeedback system" by creating the system themselves. Thus, management must appreciate that the cen-tral issue is not whether the system measures with great precision, but that it furnishes a platform orvehicle for continual improvement. Although overall accuracy is important, management should resistfine-tuning. 10.10.3.  The essence of good management is continual improvement. So, it really does not matter ifa feasible best is 65 or 70 or that a normal performance point is 25 or 30. What is important, however,is that workers accept feedback from the mission effectiveness charts and are willing to use them toidentify better ways of doing business. It's reasonable for management to disagree with and ask ques-tions about the system so long as workers maintain a feeling of ownership. In fact, management inter-est is stimulating to workers. 10.10.4.  Certainly, management must be assured that the system is measuring the important compo-nents of the mission. If the system does not capture the important components of the mission, thentime and resources could be improperly diverted by the system into less important areas of work.However, if management changes the system unnecessarily—perhaps merely to show who is"boss"—workers will lose their sense of ownership and become resigned to "business as usual."They'll do only what they are told and without much enthusiasm. They will once again be unwilling tomake suggestions about improvement. This, of course, would mean that the main purpose of the feed-back system has been defeated. Another way for the feedback system to be defeated is for manage-ment to be unresponsive to worker suggestions about how to improve the processes. Rather than beingrule-bound and rigid, managers must play a supportive role and be willing to endorse improvement. 10.10.5.  A second concern of the facilitator should be to convince the higher-level managers not toexpect to routinely monitor work center mission effectiveness charts. Mission effectiveness charts arenot part of any reporting requirement to higher management. Instead, management will receive aggre-gated or "rolled-up" results of work center performance, as discussed in the previous section. Manag-212AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003ers need to appreciate that the mission effectiveness charts are intended for use only by the workcenter supervisor and workers as tools to improve work center performance. 10.10.6.  The facilitator should also make it clear to personnel involved in implementation that theyneed not fear management disapproval of the feedback system sent for review. In fact, such disap-proval, if handled correctly, can prove to be one of the most valuable facets of implementing the feed-back system. Initial disapproval requires that managers and workers engage in a dialogue to seekagreement on the details of the system. After reflection, most workers welcome this dialogue becausemanagement is expressing an interest in their work. The workers now have an opportunity to presenttheir viewpoint to management. Managers also welcome such dialogue because its underlying pur-pose is improving organizational performance that is of vital importance to them. In such discussions,both sides usually make concessions to some degree and consensus is soon reached on the final sys-tem to use. 10.10.7.  As mentioned earlier, higher-level management has the right to approve or change the feed-back system. Therefore, the facilitator should present the feedback system to workers realistically andin this light. The facilitator should stress that the feedback system represents an opportunity for work-ers to make suggestions to management about the best way to measure and improve organizationalperformance. The facilitator should create a positive outlook, with the expectation that most sugges-tions will likely be accepted by management. This is especially so since management took part indeveloping the feedback system. Workers are encouraged to develop a sense of ownership of the feed-back system. However, the facilitator must also make sure they are fully aware of management pre-rogatives. They shouldn't naively believe that management will automatically accept everything theysuggest. If the facilitator allows workers to believe that acceptance of their suggestions will be auto-matic, changes that result from management review are likely to surprise and disillusion workers.Then, instead of having workers who are interested and motivated, the opposite may occur. 10.11.

Ratio unit times for development of manpower standards have been expandedto include large populations, as well as single location and small population standards. The decision to useratio unit times for large populations should be based on analysis of workload count variations. If theworkload counts do not vary widely from one location to another, ratio unit times are appropriate. If thereis a wide variation, consider breaking the large population into smaller ones (e.g., small workload count,medium workload count, large workload count). If this is not feasible or desirable, then use regressionanalysis as outlined in Chapter 2. This chapter addresses development procedures to be followed whenusing ratio unit times. 11.2.  Population Definition.  11.2.1.  Single location is applicable when the function under study is peculiar to one location or theservice furnished (mode of operation) is very different from other locations. 11.2.2.  Small population is defined as a population consisting of two, three, or four locations. 11.2.3.  Large population is defined as a population of five or more locations. (NOTE: it is possiblethat large populations can be broken down to smaller populations based on analysis of workload data) 11.3.  Input Data.  11.3.1.  The quality of the input data is important in any study. However, it becomes increasinglyimportant for small populations and single location studies because of the limited amount of dataavailable. Accuracy is of great importance when limited measurement is possible. Since it is the onlyinformation available, it is essential to get the best estimate(s) possible. 11.3.2.  When using Operational Audit (OA) as the primary measurement method, get multiple timeestimates to find the best representation of the per accomplishment times. Procedures for handlingmultiple readings are in Chapter 9. Evaluate these measurements carefully, using available statisticalanalysis techniques. 11.3.3.  Accuracy is also critical when work sampling (WS) is selected as the prime measurementmethod. Do WS as prescribed in Chapter 15. 11.4.  Ratio Unit Times.  11.4.1.  The ratio (b-value) is the result of measured direct man-hours divided by the associated work-load. It represents the direct man-hours needed to produce one unit of work. The ratio developmentprocess is similar for both OA and WS except for one distinct difference: SIAMs are not used in WS;therefore, the final equation developed using WS doesn’t need adjustment. 11.4.2.  Equations developed by ratio unit times takes one of two forms, depending on whether or notthe fixed man-hours are separated from the variable man-hours (see Table 11.1.). 11.4.2.1.  The first equation form is: Y = a + b1X1 + b2X2 + … + bnXn where the a-value representsthe sum of the fixed man-hours and the b-values represent the ratios of the variable man-hours totheir respective WLFs. 216AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 200311.4.2.2.  The second equation form is Y = b1X1 + b2X2 + … +bnXn and is the same as the firstequation except there is no a-value. Use of the second equation is optional. 11.4.2.3.  Associate variable man-hours with processes or steps that are expected to show a rela-tionship with the selected WLF. 11.4.3.

Certain work centers do not require work measurement to develop all or part ofa standard.  In these work centers, the objective of determining the manpower requirement can be met atless cost with acceptable validity by using functional models (Chapter 6), minimum manpower situation(Chapter 7), staffing pattern (including directed organizational positions), and SIAMs (Chapter 13).Use these methods in combination with measured data. 12.2.  Staffing Pattern.  12.2.1.  A staffing pattern recognizes long-standing use of manpower and standard operating proce-dures in a work center responsible for subordinate organizational elements. A directed organizationposition (for example, a commander) and the associated direct support position (for example, vicecommander and secretary) are examples of a staffing pattern. The study team decides if a workloadfactor is relevant when using a staffing pattern. The size of the organization, in terms of manpowerrequirements or the number of subordinate elements, may drive the size of the work center. Explainpattern variations between locations in terms of workload or conditional factors. A staffing pattern,used as the basis for a standard, may result in a quantitative expression that is variable in terms ofworkload or may result in a constant manpower requirement for all applicable locations. The staffingpattern is normally used in work centers that command or manage two or more subordinate elements.Use the staffing pattern when these apply. 12.2.1.1.  The work center is a specified element of a formal organizational structure approved byHQ USAF/XPM 12.2.1.2.  The work center is reasonably stable as shown by consistent use of manpower in termsof the number, AFSCs, and grades of personnel over at least a 2-year period. 12.2.2.  Directed organization position specifies a fixed manpower requirement to fill a particularnamed assignment (that is, wing commander, installation commander, etc.). This requirement isessential to the existence of a work center and will not change regardless of increases or decreases inworkload or changes in the MAF. The directed organization position is usually the result of a staffingpattern or operational audit study. The directed organization position requirement is dictated by theneed for one to be on duty in a given office of responsibility even though the individual may not becontinuously productive. The man-hours that the given office must be manned are requiredman-hours. If a policy calls for several assistant personnel in a given office at a particular time, mea-sure the assistants to validate the need. Do not conduct a measurement in the case of a stated two-manpolicy that is driven by security or safety reasons. 220AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003Chapter 13 STANDARD INDIRECT ALLOWED MAN-HOURS (SIAM) 13.1.  General Concepts. To meet the needs for flexibility and accuracy, each functional OPR needs aStandard Indirect Description (SID) that fits their function. There are eleven categories of indirect work:Administers Civilian Employee, Administers Officer, Administers Enlisted Personnel, Directs Work Cen-ter Activity, Provides Administrative Support, Prepares for and Conducts/Attends Meeting, AdministersTraining, Manages Supplies, Maintains Equipment (Non Aircraft Maintenance Function), MaintainsEquipment (Aircraft Maintenance Function), and Performs Cleanup. A "shopping list" method allows thefunctional and manpower communities to decide which SID tasks apply. Each SID task has an associatedpredetermined man-hour value. These predetermined man-hours are referred to as Standard IndirectAllowed Man-hours (SIAM) values. They were developed as a nonmeasurement method for determininga work center's indirect man-hour requirements. This concept uses standardized (core) indirect tasks thatare common to most Air Force work centers. Indirect tasks are published in AFMS 00AA, Standard Indi-rect Allowed Man-hours. (NOTE: AFMIA is currently conducting an in-depth review of the SIAM. Oncethis review has been completed, updated guidance will be forthcoming. Until this review is complete, theinstructions in this chapter should be followed.) 13.2.  Classifying Work as Direct or Indirect.  13.2.1.  When developing a Process Oriented Description (POD), all of the allowed productive workdone by the work center is documented. This process describes the work in enough detail to allow foraccurate measurement of the work center manpower requirements. All work needed to produce an enditem (work unit) is grouped together as a process. Each process is represented by a work unit. Set upprocesses for all productive work, then classify the processes of work as either direct or indirect. Thisis often where problems begin. 13.2.2.  Direct work defines productive work that directly relates to the work center producing an endproduct. It also defines work that is in direct support of the mission. Indirect work defines productivework that must be done, but does not directly relate to the work center producing an end product.Unlike direct work, it does not directly support the mission, e.g., preparing an enlisted performancereport. 13.2.3.  The SID defines all allowed core indirect work. This work is classified as indirect only whenit's in support of the work center where it's done. Classify work done in support of subordinate workcenters as direct work. In the latter case, these work centers are called "overhead" functions. Thesefunctions have direct management responsibility for one or more subordinate work centers. 13.2.4.  Classify most tasks in the categories of Administers Civilian, Administers Officer, Adminis-ters Enlisted Personnel, Directs Work Center Activity, and Provides Administrative Support as indi-rect or direct. Classify tasks performed for subordinate work centers as direct work. This means that itis possible to have the same activities in both direct processes and indirect categories of work.AFMAN 38-208, Volume 1, Table 3.2, is a decision logic table for identifying tasks in the SID aseither direct or indirect. AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 200322113.3.  SIAM Task Data Sheets. SIAM Task Data Sheets have been developed for each task in the SID.These task data sheets were designed for determining which SID tasks apply to the function to be mea-sured, and how the task is classified. Task data sheets are located in AFMS 00AA. 13.3.1.  Task Title. Shows the task number and title as documented in AFMS 00AA. Task numberswill always remain unchanged. 13.3.2.  Definition. Shows the task definition as documented in AFMS 00AA. Exercise caution tomake sure the complete definition applies. If any portion does not apply, do not use the SIAMman-hour equation. Measure the task using the measurement instructions shown on the task sheets. 13.3.3.  Applicability. The applicability statement defines those circumstances that could preclude theuse of the SIAM man-hour equation. Some examples are: 13.3.3.1.  The activity frequency used to develop the SIAM man-hour equation may differ fromthe natural rate of occurrence in the work center being measured. 13.3.3.2.  When the work being performed is done by an overhead or another work center. TheSIAMs may be applicable as a direct task rather than indirect, e.g., processing mail. Processingmail is normally credited in the indirect tasks, Processes Unclassified Incoming Distribution andProcesses Unclassified Outgoing Distribution. A work center with a large volume of mail to pro-cess might have a full-time mail clerk. In this case, the work is classified as direct. No additionalcredit should be given for this workload through SIAMs. 13.3.4.  Task Classification. The "shopping list" approach credits the work center with indirectman-hours. Man-hours associated with these tasks are identified as either fixed, variable, or person-nel-generated. 13.3.4.1.  Fixed Task Man-Hours. Fixed task man-hours do not vary with selected workload factorand are independent of the work center size. 13.3.4.2.  Variable Task Man-Hours. Variable task man-hours have a direct relationship to theselected work units produced or selected workload factor. There are only a few indirect tasks thathave been identified as variable, all in categories 9 and 10, Maintains Equipment. 13.3.4.3.  Personnel-Generated Task Man-Hours. Personnel-generated task man-hours vary withthe number of personnel assigned to the work center. They are not expected to show a direct rela-tionship to the selected workload factor or remain constant. They are expected to relate to the total(direct and indirect) fixed and variable man-hours expended by the personnel in the work center.Personnel-generated task man-hours will be credited to the work center based on the averageassigned strength of the work center. However, there are exceptions. For example, a work centerhas two officers assigned, and one officer is the work center supervisor or officer in charge (OIC).Only credit indirect man-hours for preparing Officer Performance Reports (OPRs) for one officer.Credit the preparation of the OIC's OPR as direct work to the overhead work center. PAT remeas-urement for this task as direct work is not needed. Use the standard indirect task time (b value) anddetermine the activity frequency from the measurement instructions of the pertinent SIAMs TaskData Sheet. The same logic and rationale applies to every personnel-generated task in the SID. 13.3.5.  Man-hour Equation. For some tasks, the allowed monthly man-hours have been converted toa per accomplishment time to help the craftsman and OPR in analyzing the task time for applicability.For example, task I3.3. Types Enlisted Evaluation, has a monthly man-hour value of 0.06193 perenlisted person assigned (less one if the work center supervisor is enlisted). In most instances, this222AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003block also gives a per-unit accomplishment time. For example, task I3.3 allows 0.93 man-hours perenlisted evaluation typed. This information can be helpful when telling how much time is being cred-ited to a work center for a certain task. 13.3.6.  Measurement Instructions. This section shows the full instructions for determining the activ-ity frequency and per accomplishment time when measurement is used in lieu of SIAMs. Follow theseinstructions explicitly, since they were used to develop the SIAMs. AF Form 1040 is completed IAWthe chapter on operational audit. 13.4.  Using SIAMs.  13.4.1.  Selecting the SIAM Task. There is more to selecting a SIAM task than merely looking at thetask title. There are four important steps that MUST be followed when selecting a SIAM task. 13.4.1.1.  Step 1. Using the task title as a point of departure, find out whether or not the task isdone in the work center being measured. 13.4.1.2.  Step 2. Read the task definition. If ALL of the task definition elements apply to the workcenter being measured, then proceed to the next step. If ANY of the task definition elements arenot done, or additional elements are done, the SIAM task man-hours CANNOT be used. You mustmeasure this task using the task measurement instructions. 13.4.1.3.  Step 3. Read the applicability statement. If the work center being measured satisfies allof the applicability criteria, proceed to the next step. If ANY of the applicability criteria ARENOT satisfied, the SIAM task man-hours CANNOT be used. You must measure this task using thetask measurement instructions. 13.4.1.4.  Step 4. The last check is for logic. Is the SIAM allowed time representative of what nor-mally occurs in this work center? If it's too high or too low, you must measure this task using thetask measurement instructions. 13.4.2.  SIAM Measurement. With these modifications, AF Forms 1040 will be completed IAW thechapter on operational audit (see Chapter 9). 13.4.2.1.  Fixed Tasks. The fixed task allowed monthly man-hours (a value) will be entered in col-umn 5F, Per Month, of the AF Form 1040. An activity frequency code of "S" and a per accom-plishment code of "F" will be entered in column 5H, Type Data, of the AF Form 1040. 13.4.2.2.  Variable Tasks. The variable task activity frequency will be entered in column 5B,Activity Frequency, and a frequency conversion code of "7" will be entered in column 5C, Freq.Code, of the AF Form 1040. An activity frequency code of "S" will be entered in column 5H, TypeData, of the AF Form 1040. The per accomplishment time, Column 5E, will be the "b value" fromthe SIAMs equation. A per accomplishment code of "V" will be entered in column 5H, Type Data,of the AF Form 1040. 13.4.2.3.  Personnel-Generated Tasks. Enter the personnel-generated task activity frequency(number of the assigned personnel for the pertinent task) in column 5B, Activity Frequency, and afrequency conversion code of "7" in column 5C, Freq. Code, of the AF Form 1040. Enter an activ-ity frequency code of "S" in column 5H, Type Data, of the AF Form 1040. Enter the per accom-plishment time, the "b value" from the SIAM equation, in column 5E. Enter a per accomplishmentcode of "P" in column 5H, Type Data, of the AF Form 1040. AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 200322313.5.  Alternate Indirect Man-Hour Measurement Methods: 13.5.1.  In addition to the SIAM, several other standard indirect measurement methods are available toprovide flexibility in responding to the dynamic expeditionary nature of our aerospace forces. Thesetools include the Standard Indirect Allowed Man-Hour Equation (SIAME), Direct and Indirect Man-power Equation (DIME) and the Capabilities Based Manpower Determinant (CBMD) Standard Indi-rect Allowance Factor (SIAF). 13.5.1.1.  The Air Force is transforming to a capabilities-focused Expeditionary Air and SpaceForce. In doing so, our goal is to make warfighting effects, and the capabilities we need to achievethem, the drivers for everything we do. In addressing this Air Force goal, we define manpowerrequirements in an environment of global engagement with expeditionary forces performing capa-bilities. We call this manpower quantification the CBMD. 13.5.1.2.  The CBMD SIAF is designed to address indirect man-hours or indirect fractional man-ning when computing a CBMD manpower requirement. The DIME is designed to address indirectman-hours or fractional manning when combining all CBMDs for a determination of manpowerrequirements at the organizational level or function. 13.5.2.  Each tool is discussed in detail in the following paragraphs. Table 13.1., Standard IndirectMeasurement Tools Decision Logic Table, describes the advantages and disadvantages of each tooland when they are recommended for use. 224AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003Table 13.1.  Standard Indirect Measurement Tools Decision Logic Table Method SIAM Recommended Employment To measure indirect man-hours for traditional peacetime manpower standards. Advantage Most Accurate for non-CBMD manpower studies. Disadvantage Slightly time consuming. Not designed for CBMD studies. Quicker than SIAM.  Not designed for CBMD studies. Quick method to determine total CBMD FTEs for a function. Not as accurate as SIAM. Not intended for application until completion of all associated CBMD studies. SIAME Same as SIAM. DIME To quantify total CBMD manpower for a function. Since DIME was developed as a relationship of indirect requirement to direct requirement (while the SIAM and SIAME based on current assigned personnel), a recommended tool for computing indirect requirements for Most Efficient Organization (MEO). Also recommended for “to be” organizational models especially when significantly different from the “as is” POD. CBMD SIAF  To quantify CBMD indirect man-hours or indirect fractional manpower. Also, a recommended tool for computing indirect requirements once direct requirements have been determined for relatively small mission changes or efficiencies. Quick method to determine incremental indirect man-hours for a single CBMD. Not as accurate as total measurement or SIAM. 13.6.  Standard Indirect Allowed Man-Hour Equation (SIAME)  13.6.1.  The SIAME is an alternate method of crediting indirect man-hours for Operational Audit andTime Study standards. Direct and SIAME man-hours are added to determine total monthly man-hoursfor work centers of five or more assigned personnel. 13.6.2.  The SIAME was developed using the FAC family approach. Functional areas were analyzedby reviewing the primary mission, types of specialties used, and organizational levels within the func-tion. Associated FACs were then grouped into SIAME families using the following definitions: 13.6.2.1.  Management and Administration Work Centers. These work centers have the primaryfunction of managing subordinate organizational elements and providing unit administrative sup-port. Examples include the medical support squadron’s personnel and administration flight, thecivil engineer unit administration and the operations squadron’s operations officer and the mainte-nance officer. AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 200322513.6.2.2.  Production and Staff Support Work Centers. These work centers have the primary func-tion of supporting the production area of an organization and researching, evaluating, reporting,coordinating, and advising. Examples include the wing manpower and organization office, thecomptroller squadron financial analysis flight, the civil engineering or services squadron’sresource management flights and the medical support squadron’s medical information servicesflight. 13.6.2.3.  Customer Service Work Centers. These work centers have the primary function of pro-viding specific services to customers. Examples include the military and civilian personnel flights,base billeting, military pay and travel. 13.6.2.4.  Medical Work Centers. These work centers include medical facilities and dental ser-vices. 13.6.2.5.  Warehouse, Storage, and Issue. These work centers have the primary function of receiv-ing, storing, or issuing material. Examples include the supply squadron material storage and distri-bution flight and fuels management flight. 13.6.2.6.  Industrial Shop. These work centers have the primary function of testing, overhauling,repairing, or manufacturing specific products. Examples include aerospace ground equipment andvehicle maintenance. 13.6.2.7.  Table 13.2., Air Force Peacetime SIAME Families reflects the SIAME for each of theFAC family. Table 13.2.

Table 13.3. complements Table 13.2., Table 13.4. and Table 13.5.. It reflects theSIAME, DIME and SIAF Family for each specific FAC. Table 13.2., Table 13.4. and Table 13.5.are summaries of SIAME, DIME and SIAF models by general FAC family. The study team iden-tifies the family on Table 13.3. and uses the indicated equation or factor specified on Table 13.2.,Table 13.3. or Table 13.5.. For example, Table 13.3. reflects Production and Staff Support for the226AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003Manpower function. Table 13.2. states the SIAME model to use is Y(SIAME) = 176.90 +10.4032X, Table 13.4. states the DIME model to use is Y(DIME) = 1.88 + 1.0785X, and Table13.5. states the SIAF factor to use is 1.0785.

Ensure the standard indirect description reflected in AFMS 00AAAFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003237applies. If ANY of the indirect task definition elements are not done, or additional elements aredone, a variance must be developed to supplement the DIME. In this case, you must measure thistask using the SIAM Task Measurement Instructions reflected on the SIAM Task Data Sheet.These measured man-hours are then added or subtracted, as appropriate, from the results of theDIME application. 13.6.3.2.  Y (SIAME)  = Indirect man-hours from application of the applicable SIAME. 13.6.3.3.  Y(Tot) = Total direct and indirect man-hours. Y(Tot) = Y(Dir) + Y (SIAME)  13.6.3.4.  Application. The standards development team develops a direct manpower equation,Y(Dir), using measured direct time and an indirect equation, Y (SIAME), using the selected SIAMEand the average number of assigned work center personnel as the workload factor. The directequation results are added to the SIAME results to derive the total monthly man-hours. 13.6.3.4.1.  Application Example: Using a notional Y(Dir) = 300 + 5.6555X equation, Y(Dir) = 300 + 5.6555X (Where X(Dir)  = Workload Factor = 250 Vehicles Assigned).  Y(Dir) = 300 + 5.6555(250) =  1713.88. Y (SIAME)  = 270.13 + 9.3033X (X(SIAME)   = 12 Average Assigned Personnel).   Y (SIAME)  = 270.13 + 9.3033 (12) = 381.77 Indirect Man-Hours Y(Tot) = Y (DIR)  + Y (SIAME)  = Y (Tot)  Y(Tot) = 1713.88 + 381.77 = 2095.65 Total Man-Hours 13.6.4.  Using SIAME: 13.6.4.1.  The study team must use caution when selecting the SIAME. Review the FAC familydefinitions in paragraphs 13.6.2.1. through 13.6.2.6. and select the SIAME that best fits the workcenter or function being studied. Ensure the standard indirect description reflected in AFMS00AAapplies. If ANY of the indirect task definition elements are not done, or additional elements aredone, a variance must be developed to supplement the SIAME. In this case, you must measure thistask using the SIAM task measurement instructions reflected on the SIAM task data sheet. Thesemeasured man-hours are then added or subtracted, as appropriate, from the results of the SIAMEapplication. 13.6.4.2.  Use logic. If the SIAME allowed time is not representative of what normally occurs inthe work center the study team should measure the task using the SIAM task data sheet measure-ment instructions. 13.7.

Y(Dir) = Direct manpower from application of a manpower equation and subsequent con-version to a manpower requirement by applying the applicable MAF. 13.7.2.2.  Y(DIME) = Total manpower requirement by applying the direct manpower (Y(Dir)) in theapplicable DIME. 13.7.2.3.  Application. Prior to using the DIME model it is necessary to quantify the total func-tional direct manpower (Y(DIR)). This is accomplished by determining the total direct requiredmonthly man-hours for the function and dividing by the appropriate MAF. The study team selectsthe appropriate DIME (Y(DIME)) model (See Table 13.3. ) and applies direct manpower as theindependent variable. The DIME produces the total direct and indirect manpower. 13.7.2.4.  Application Example: Using a notional Y(Dir) = 300 + 5.6555X equation, Y(Dir) = 300 + 5.6555X (Where X(Dir)  = Workload Factor = 250 Vehicles Assigned).  Y(Dir) = 300 + 5.6555(250) =  1713.88 Direct Man-Hours. 1713.88/149.6 = 11.46 Direct Manpower Y (DIME)  = 1.81 + 1.0681X (Where X   = Direct Manpower).

Ensure the standard indirect description reflected in AFMS00AA applies. If ANY of the indirect task definition elements are not done, or additional elementsare done, the SIAF CANNOT be used. You must measure the indirect workload using the SIAMtask measurement instructions reflected on the SIAM task data sheet. AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 200324113.8.5.2.  Use logic.

General Concepts.  14.1.1.  Time study is a work measurement method that records the time a worker takes to do each ele-ment of an operation in a specified way. A pace rating factor is applied to the recorded times to adjustthem according to the pace of an average worker. The total of the elemental allowed times then givesthe standard for the operation. 14.1.2.  Time study is used primarily to measure operations that are repetitive, of short duration, anddone at one work station. 14.1.3.  The purposes of time study are: 14.1.3.1.  To analyze the operations and job conditions to improve existing methods. 14.1.3.2.  To increase the effectiveness of effort by using only necessary motions. 14.1.3.3.  To establish standard conditions for an efficient operation. 14.1.3.4.  To set up consistent and fair standards of performance. 14.1.3.5.  To furnish reliable data for use in constructing equations and charts. 14.1.4.  In addition, use time study to develop elemental standards to synthesize time standards foroperations that have the same elements in different combinations. This eliminates the need for remea-surement. 14.1.5.  Although few situations meet the time study prerequisites of being both highly standardizedand repetitive, the broad use and acceptance of the method, coupled with its accuracy advantages,warrants its consideration. However, if the prerequisites are not met, do not use the method. 14.2.  Verification of the Process Oriented Description (POD). The time study method is generallyused for some portions of the POD. To do this: 14.2.1.  Verify that the portion of the POD to be time-studied is properly designed. Make sure eachstep describes the operations in the proper sequence with definite beginning and ending points. 14.2.2.  Ensure the POD agrees with governing directives and local performance procedures. Signifi-cant differences from location to location may cause variances in timing and result in inaccurate val-ues. Resolve any differences before timing operations. 14.3.  Wartime Operation Measurement. Time study is not applicable for functions where wartime andpeacetime operations differ. Since this technique needs step repetition, the OPR must apply a greatamount of effort and expense to duplicate the wartime situation for measurement. Thus, the amount ofeffort involved may not justify the practicality of this measurement method. 14.4.  How to do Time Study.  AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 200324314.4.1.  Set up a system to record daily work counts. If the work center activities do not allow this tobe done, record the work unit count as the work is finished. Use production reports, but get enoughdata to verify them, make valid comparisons, and set an average workload level. 14.4.2.  Find the time study method that best fits the work situation to accurately measure the varioussteps. Two basic ways of reading a watch when doing a time study are the snapback method and con-tinuous method. 14.4.2.1.  In the snapback (repetitive) method, record a reading after timing each element, and thenreset the watch back to zero. 14.4.2.1.1.  Advantages of this method are that it eliminates the need for making subtractionsto find element time and that it also facilitates rapid analysis of variations in readings for eachelement per cycle. 14.4.2.1.2.  Disadvantages of this method are that it does not present a clear picture of thesequence in which the elements were done and that the extent and nature of foreign elementsas they occur are not always recorded. In addition, unavoidable errors occur due to the timeneeded to snap the watch back to zero. 14.4.2.2.  In the continuous method, the watch runs continuously from the beginning to the end ofthe study. Record the time at the end of each element. 14.4.2.2.1.  An advantage of this method is that every event that occurs is recorded and istraceable back to the actual sequence of occurrence. This makes it easy to handle elements thatoccur out of normal sequence. 14.4.2.2.2.  The disadvantage of this method is that additional time is needed to develop theelemental time. 14.4.2.3.  The use of either the snapback or continuous method is at the discretion of the crafts-man. However, Figure 14.1. displays the various characteristics that contribute to the use of eachmethod and should be taken into account when selecting a particular timing method. For example,when checking a job situation to be timed, use Figure 14.1. to select a timing method. If at leastsix job situation attributes are identified in a timing method, then that method should be favorablyconsidered for use. 244AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003Figure 14.1.  Timing Methods Attributes. The suggested timing method to be used is Snapback (Repetitive) Method When the available time study equipment is - Easy to use - Decimal minute watch Continuous Method - difficult or cumbersome - decimal hour watch and the elements to be timed are - few in number - long in duration - easy to time - relatively constant  occurrence - many in number - short in duration - hard to time - somewhat variable with  only minor  interruptions and the study environment - is semi-quiet - has good lighting - elements are performed  in usually one location - is climate controlled - allows for normal  wearing apparel - is crowded or noisy - has uneven lighting or  dark areas - elements are performed  in several locations in  sequence - has a climate variable  in nature - requires the wearing  of safety equipment 14.4.3.  When conducting the study: 14.4.3.1.  Identify elements to be timed to make sure that they are recognizable and have obviousbeginning and ending points before starting the study. Audible beginning and ending points makesthe process easier. 14.4.3.2.  Make a sketch showing the equipment used, flow of work, significant distances traveledby the operator, and unusual working conditions. 14.4.3.3.  Record stopwatch readings on DD Forms 2042, Work Measurement Time StudyWorksheet (snapback); DD Form 2042-1, Work Measurement Time Study Worksheet (Con-tinuous Method); or DD Form 2043, Work Measurement Project Non-Repetitive Time Study.The Industrial Engineering Handbook and the commercial texts on motion and time study discussthe various timing techniques that may be used. 14.4.3.4.  Take readings for 5 to 20 cycles to find the number of good readings needed. 14.4.3.5.  Circle and do not use those readings that are obviously inaccurate because of fumbles,distractions, or changes in methods. 14.4.3.6.  Pace rate each timed element. The technician compares the observed pace (speed) ofwork done to a predetermined normal pace (see paragraph 15.17.2.). 14.5.  Determining Sample Size.  AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 200324514.5.1.  Find the number of readings needed after measuring a relatively small number of cycles.Include the first cycle readings as part of the total needed. Observe complete cycles of an operationand take readings on all elements of the cycle. The number of cycle readings needed is the highestnumber needed for any one element. 14.5.2.  Table 14.1. gives instructions to compute the number of samples needed. 246AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003Table 14.1.  Validating Time Study Samples.

If not, additional samples are needed. Go to step 9. 9  Calculate new sample size using values just calculated (z*, sx, & d). Obtain additional samples to meet this new size.

WS is a measurement method based on the principle that random samples taken from a largegroup tend to keep the same distribution characteristics as the group. Conclusions are drawn about thepopulation based on the sample. The WS method relies heavily on input technicians to collect accu-rate samples and workload information. 15.1.2.  The method defines processes, makes observations, computes percentage of occurrence foreach process, and applies these percentages to man-hours sampled. 15.2.  Wartime Operation Measurement. The WS method has limited application for a wartime envi-ronment because of the time needed to successfully do a measurement of this type. Another drawback isthat if peacetime data, measured by WS, is converted to wartime values, consistency between peacetimeand wartime policy and procedures must be assumed. Conversion in this instance is limited to workloadand the MAF only. The most likely arena for WS in a wartime operation is a realistic and representativeexercise or operational readiness inspection. 15.3.  Applying WS.  15.3.1.  WS is commonly used to determine equipment utilization; analyze work distribution; conductmethods improvement studies; and compute and verify personal, rest, and delay (PR&D) allowances.WS is most effective when work centers have: 15.3.1.1.  Nonrepetitive or irregular work. 15.3.1.2.  Many different processes of work. 15.3.1.3.  Many workers in a relatively small area. 15.3.2.  Take care when identifying work centers to be sampled. Historically, work centers requiringproduct analysis, closed-session counseling, or creative thinking have been difficult to sample. Forthese work centers, consider using productive and nonproductive sampling (see paragraph 15.21.1.).Some office work is difficult to quantify by WS because the work is not cyclical or is completed overa long period of time. Also, work cycles may be variable because of the many different products. 15.4.  Economic Desirability of WS.  15.4.1.  The economic desirability of WS increases with the number of people being sampled. Eachmeasurement technician should measure a minimum of five workers where possible; however, thosebeing sampled may be assigned to more than one work center, for example, family of standards. Gen-erally, measure a work center with two or less people by OA unless it is necessary to observe standbytime or the need for an assistant. When several input points have four or less people to be measured, itis not economical to conduct a WS study. 15.4.2.  The measurement work force should consist of personnel who spend most of their availabletime in a place that allows for observation of work. Account for work done away from the immediatework center for extended periods of time as follows: AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 200325515.4.2.1.  Arrange for a measurement technician to observe the worker at the out-of-area location. 15.4.2.2.  Sample this time as out-of-area and OA this time if it is not feasible to observe theworker. Account for out-of-area samples by applicable process on the daily observation sheet.However, do not transfer these samples to the AF Form 1111, Work Sampling Record. Mergeout-of-area time later with WS time on the AF Form 308. For multipoint standards, study teamsfurnish guidance in the measurement plan for treatment of these samples. 15.4.2.3.  Do not plan for more observations than a technician can do in a reasonable period. Giv-ing the measuring technician too many personnel or too many work centers may not allow timelyobservations and may bias the sampling data. Conversely, giving the measuring technician too fewpersonnel is not economically feasible. 15.5.  Briefings for WS.  15.5.1.  Study Inbriefing. Make sure the work center supervisor and workers fully understand the prin-ciple of WS during the inbriefing. Because its statistical basis makes WS difficult to understand, useillustrations without technical terms. Use simple explanations to eliminate confusion and allow workcenter personnel to understand the WS principle. Some examples of situations similar in principle toWS are: testing antifreeze in a car radiator, taking blood samples, or trying one package of cigarettesbefore buying a carton. Since all of these actions represent the source from which they come, the opin-ions formed from the samples are valid for the whole product. Explain during inbriefing that WS dailyobservation sheets are to be treated confidentially and not shown to supervisors or managers. Sam-pling data must never be used by superiors to evaluate individuals. 15.5.2.  Study Outbriefing. Summarize process percentages of occurrence for presentation during out-briefings. A pie chart is a convenient way to graphically present this information. Brief local OPRs onmeasured man-hours and workload factor values. Cover the treatment of assumed and inferred work.Tell local OPRs measurement results do not represent the final standard. The study team does C&Ranalysis and computes the final standard using data from measurement points. 15.6.  WS Process Development.  15.6.1.  Write the Process Oriented Description (POD) for WS at the same level as for OA, or write itat the broader process level. Study teams may derive step times by using the percentage estimatesdescribed in paragraph 15.21.. In either case, write the POD to facilitate observation during sampling.Make sure processes in the POD cover all required work, and are clearly distinctive, yet mutuallyexclusive. 15.6.2.  Select processes for both direct and indirect work. Further define the process by using steps.Each step must be discrete and understandable to the observer. Failure to clearly define processes dis-torts process percentages and later makes analysis and standard maintenance difficult. 15.6.3.  WS studies identify time spent in available and nonavailable activities. Available time isbroadly classified as productive (direct and indirect) and nonproductive. Examples of nonavailableactivities are: leave, medical absences, TDY for training, and additional duties. Additional processesfor management information such as additional duties may be described and measured during WS. 15.6.4.  Nonproductive categories, for sampling purposes, are personal and rest, idle (extended lunch)and unavoidable delay. Other nonproductive categories may be added when needed, for example,assumed and inferred. Do not use other and miscellaneous for nonproductive category titles as they256AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003become catchalls during WS studies. Usually, productive indirect and nonproductive activities aresampled at the category level. Data collected for these categories is useful when outbriefing WSresults. Treatment of lunch and unscheduled time is described in these paragraphs. 15.6.4.1.  Sample lunch to account for productive time expended during the lunch period and toaccount for nonproductive time taken for an extended lunch. Sampling of lunch eases the account-ing of samples at the end of each sampling day. Be cautious when selecting random times andmaking observations during the lunch period. Incorrect accounting of lunch samples affects otherprocess percentages. Study teams give specific guidance on treatment of lunch observations in themeasurement plan. This example illustrates the need for caution: Assume three observations perhour are being taken and the lunch period for half the work center is 1100 to 1200. Assume theother half takes lunch from 1200 to 1300. Select random times so that three observations occurbetween 1100 and 1200 and three occur between 1200 and 1300. The sampling technician nor-mally records three samples for lunch for each worker. However, if worker A (from the firstgroup) was working at 1145 (observation time) and did not take his or her full lunch hour, then oneproductive sample and two lunch samples would be recorded. On the other hand, if worker B(from the second group) left for lunch at his or her regular time and was still on lunch break at1310 (observation time), then three lunch samples and one idle or extended lunch sample wouldbe recorded for worker B. If lunch periods are staggered or workers do not take scheduled lunchbreaks, this example is inappropriate. In this case, sample lunch cautiously and check the percent-age of lunch samples daily and at the end of the study to verify representativeness. 15.6.4.2.  An unscheduled (U) category is useful for keeping accountability of samples. Use thiscategory when: 15.6.4.2.1.  Shift changes are staggered during a multi-shift operation. 15.6.4.2.2.  Workers are doing required work before the beginning or after the end of a sched-uled shift. 15.7.  POD Verification. As part of the verification process, accomplish the following: 15.7.1.  Investigate the operation of the work center thoroughly before beginning the study. Checkorganizational structure, mission requirements, directives, and other pertinent factors such as back-logs, work cycles, and historical production. 15.7.2.  Review the POD. Contact the study team for guidance if steps are found that are not in theapproved POD. Measure such steps separately. The study team, in cooperation with the OPR duringdata analysis, makes the final decision to include or disallow these steps in the manpower standard. Ifthe study team determines the added steps apply to all work centers, the POD is changed. 15.8.  Work Counts (Work Units and Potential WLFs). Man-hours collected during WS studies repre-sent only one part of the data needed to compute an equation. The other part is work counts. Set up a workcount system to record workload on a daily basis. If work counts are not completed daily, then recordthem as frequently as the work is completed. Use a production report if it is available, but make periodicchecks to make sure of its accuracy. Make sure the period of the production report corresponds with thestudy period. Pay particular attention to recording correct values for work started before the study andwork continuing after the study. Do not include work unit counts for days sampled but dropped from com-putations for nonrepresentativeness. Adjust the average daily work counts to an average monthly figure.AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003257Use this figure as the independent variable for the standard man-hour equation. Use totalmonthly-allowed man-hours as the dependent variable. An exception to this procedure is allowed whenthe potential WLF is nonproduction oriented. For example, population serviced may be relatively con-stant on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. In this case, use population serviced as reported for the timeframe closest to the WS period for the dependent variable. 15.9.  Determining Sampling Period.  15.9.1.  Sample at least one complete cycle during the measurement period. The normal samplingperiod is 21 days (minimum of 15 usable days). When necessary, extend the sampling period to makesure it covers a complete cycle. 15.9.2.  Conduct WS over a representative period or work cycle. Ideally, use WS when a normalperiod of productivity is to be measured and when relatable work units are available. When a workcycle is longer than a month, the study team decides the feasibility of using WS. Also, if several indi-viduals in a small work center are on leave during the sampling period, this may affect representative-ness. In a 7-day work center, be sure to keep a representative proportion between weekend days andweekdays during the sampling period. For example, when 21 usable days are needed, six of those daysshould be weekend days. 15.9.3.  Use the experience of work center personnel to set up an average work cycle to pinpoint recur-ring periods of heavy productivity. Plotting these cycles against a time scale may reveal a pattern andits composite effect on the work center. 15.10.  Supplementing WS with OA.  15.10.1.  During a WS study, take samples for a process previously identified for measurement byOA. When this occurs, keep sample accountability on the AF Form 1152, Daily Work SamplingObservation, but do not record samples on the AF Form 1111. Measure the process by OA on AFForm 1040 and transfer this time to the AF Form 308 along with the monthly-allowed man-hours fromWS. 15.10.2.  The study team evaluates the supplemental OA for nonroutine work based on total review ofOA work. No adjustment is needed for nonroutine work if the sampling period is considered represen-tative. Study teams give special instructions to identify and report cyclical work that occurs less fre-quently than monthly (for example, quarterly or annually). A representative sample period reduces theneed for OA. 15.10.3.  Input team members must be cautious and realize that there is a difference between work notoccurring during the sampling period and work not observed. If a particular step was done but was notobserved due to the randomness of the observation schedule, do not add OA time for the step. OAonly those nonroutine required steps that occur less frequently than monthly. Be particularly carefulwhen supplementing WS data for indirect tasks. For example, preparing annual reports may be a washitem since daily or monthly reports normally feed into annual reports and the samples may have cap-tured a normal amount of time for report preparations. Study teams identify reports and meetingsalong with sampling instructions in the measurement plan. When level I sampling is being used (pro-ductive and nonproductive), a supplemental OA for indirect tasks is not needed. 258AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 200315.11.  Man-Hour Population. The man-hour population (sampled man-hours) for accounting purposesconsists of man-hours for available, nonavailable, borrowed, lunch, and overtime. It excludes loanedman-hours. For computational purposes, the man-hour population excludes nonavailable time. Thisallows for the complete accounting of time with no degradation of accuracy and percentage of occur-rences. 15.12.  Observation Schedule Development.  15.12.1.  The purpose of sampling is to supply information about the population. Characteristics dis-covered in the sample are expected to exist in the population from which the sample is taken. The keyto unbiased sampling is randomness of the sample. Several methods are available to ensure random-ness. Two are discussed here. 15.12.1.1.  Random numbers tables. Randomly pick a starting point in a random numbers table.Proceed horizontally, diagonally, or vertically and record the one-digit, two-digit, or three-digitnumbers as they appear. Disregard numbers outside the needed range. For example, if you needtwo-digit random numbers ranging from 00 through 59, then disregard the two-digit numbersgreater than 59. If a number appears again after it has previously been recorded for use within aparticular strata (hour or day), ignore its later appearance. This ensures consistency with samplingwithout replacement. If it takes five minutes to make an observation round, disregard numberswithin five-minute increments of each other. Continue selecting numbers until you reach thedesired sample size. 15.12.1.2.  Random numbers from computers. When a computer is available, get a series of num-bers with the needed number of digits. Treat this series the same as with the random numberstable. 15.12.2.  Sampling period, work center operating hours and locations, desired accuracy, and numberof people assigned determine the number of observation rounds needed for each work center during aWS study. A sample is a single recorded status of one person during an observation of a work center.An observation yields a number of samples equal to the number of people observed. For example, anobservation made at 1015 in a seven-man work center yields seven samples. Set up the observationschedule to get no fewer than 1111 available samples (excluding lunch) in each work center. Thisnumber ensures accuracy in all available processes and eliminates the need to estimate the number ofsamples needed when conducting a mini-study. Before sampling, consult the work center supervisorregarding scheduled nonavailable activities such as leave, medical absences, or TDY. 15.12.3.  Input teams determine the observation schedule. Study teams determine the cycle, the daysto sample, and the strata to use (for example, stratified hourly or stratified daily random sampling).Take care when setting up the observation schedule. Taking less than 1111 samples might cause thestudy to fail statistical accuracy. If this happens, extend the measurement period through the nextcycle. Taking too many samples may cause an excessive number of technicians to be used for mea-surement, thereby increasing the cost of the study. 15.12.4.  Input teams select observation times so that the number of samples taken per individual perday remains constant. An exception to this rule may occur when an individual is borrowed or loaned,works overtime, is newly assigned, or departs the work center for PCS during the duty day. 15.12.5.  When an observation schedule cannot be met because locations are widely dispersed, set upa randomized location schedule. A randomized location schedule is similar to a randomized timeAFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003259schedule, however, instead of listing observation times on tickets or cards, write the title of each loca-tion on tickets or cards. Draw cards randomly from a hat or box, record locations in the order drawn,replace the cards in the box, and then repeat the draw a second, third time, etc. Next, visit each loca-tion in the order recorded. Begin sampling at the start of the normal duty day and continue until theend of the normal duty day. Move from one location to another in the order previously recorded, buton no prescribed schedule. Sample the location on arrival. Follow the recorded order until you haveenough samples to achieve accuracy, a complete cycle is sampled, and the minimum sampling periodis covered. Operationally audit overtime when this method is used. 15.12.6.  Often it is desirable to make sure each hour of the day has equal representation in the sample.In work centers where activity fluctuates hourly, use stratified sampling. In this procedure, determinethe number of observations needed per hour and randomly select observations within the hour. Oncesampling begins, input technicians must consistently follow the predetermined schedule per hour untilcompletion of the sampling period. Make sure that the number of observation times for lunch are rep-resentative before sampling. This example illustrates how to determine the number of observationsneeded per hour. 15.12.6.1.  Assume a work center size of seven people and a sampling period of 21 work days. 15.12.6.2.  One observation of seven people per hour, assigned for an 8-hour day over a 21-dayperiod, yields 1176 samples (1 x 7 x 8 x 21 = 1176). This meets the minimum requirement of 1111available samples. However, if normal nonavailability (13.5%) occurs during the study, then only86.5% of 1176 (or 1017 available samples) would be obtained. Therefore, increase the minimumnumber of observations per hour to two. Increasing the number of observations per hour above theminimum improves study accuracy and reduces the technicians' slack time. Make allowances forloaned time when setting up observation schedules. 15.13.  Man-Hour Shift Profile Sampling.  15.13.1.  The purpose of the man-hour shift profile chart is to reduce standby. When minimum man-power is not clearly defined and it is not possible to accurately sample standby, construct a present andproposed man-hour shift profile chart. Use the proposed chart to support the standby time allowed inthe standard. Also, use the chart to graphically support reduced standby to the OPR. 15.13.2.  When collecting WS data to build the man-hour shift profile chart: 15.13.2.1.  Use stratified hourly sampling. 15.13.2.2.  Designate each productive process as transferable or nontransferable. 15.13.2.3.  Construct the present man-hour shift profile chart directly from information on thedaily observation and recapitulation sheets. 15.13.2.4.  Construct the proposed chart by analyzing and improving the present chart (Chapter 7tells how to construct man-hour shift profile charts). 15.14.  WS Procedures.  15.14.1.  Make observations at scheduled times without distracting workers. Enter the work center asinconspicuously as possible. Sometimes it is best to remain in the work center between closely spacedobservations because distractions caused by entering could bias samples. 260AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 200315.14.2.  Classify the sample instantaneously so that each sample is the result of an immediate obser-vation. When it is not possible to identify the proper process, classify the sample as productive or non-productive and reconcile it later. The workers' activity immediately before or after the scheduledobservation may give a clue to proper classification. 15.14.3.  Conduct familiarization or trial sampling to reduce the number of questions during observa-tion rounds. When possible, wear apparel similar to that of personnel in the work center being sam-pled. Likeness in clothing causes the sampling technician to blend with work center personnel andhelps reduce apprehension due to the study. Avoid unnecessary conversation, but be friendly andanswer questions regarding the study. 15.14.4.  Properly classify personal, rest, unavoidable delay, standby, and idle time. Accurate identifi-cation gives rationale for using the fixed allowance factor or for proving a larger factor that includesadditional rest or delay. The technician should also be alert to assumed work (make work) or inferredwork during sampling. Although the measurement plan should identify potential areas for assumedand inferred work, the key to proper identification is the technician's familiarity with the work center.Identify inferred and assumed work separately on the AF Form 1152. Later, credit inferred work to theproper work center or remove it from allowed man-hours. Always remove assumed work fromallowed man-hours. 15.14.5.  Sample pre-duty and post-duty periods. The measurement technician should be in the workcenter when the first worker arrives and stay until the last worker departs. When a worker is presentduring pre-duty or post-duty periods, but is not productive, sample the worker as unscheduled (U) andexclude from sample man-hour computation. A productive sample during this period increases thenumber of samples per person per day and is equivalent to sampled overtime. 15.14.6.  Follow the same measurement technique for all standard input locations. For example, whenWS is the primary measurement method, all inputs use WS. An exception is allowed when the workcenter has two or less people (see paragraph 15.4.1.). When OA is specified for one process, all inputsOA that process. Also, when stratified sampling is specified, all inputs stratify. When work center per-sonnel stagger lunch periods, use stratified, hourly sampling to make sure lunch samples are represen-tative. 15.14.7.  Avoid sampling at the lower task levels unless these tasks are easily identifiable by observa-tion. Sampling a large number of steps increases the time needed to make an observation round andresults in a need for more sampling technicians. Sampling at the step level disrupts work center per-sonnel because questions need to be asked to properly classify samples. 15.14.8.  Between samples, study technicians accomplish daily accumulations, compute control chartlimits, collect work units or potential WLFs, conduct OAs, observe personnel who might be workingout-of-area, and investigate process improvement opportunities. 15.14.9.  Treat standby time during sampling according to Chapter 7. 15.14.10.  Study technicians should be able to recognize all the workers, their duty schedule and lunchperiod, and the work they do. Study technicians should also be familiar with the layout and boundariesof the work center. 15.14.11.  Record irregularities during WS in the remarks block or on the reverse side of the AF Form1152. These comments may explain variations that occur during measurement. List irregularities asAFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003261soon as practical after their occurrence. Devise coding systems to expedite sampling and facilitaterecall. Use mutually agreed-on codes when more than one technician is involved in the study. 15.15.  Daily Work Sampling Observation Form and Recapitulation Form Development.  15.15.1.  Use AF Form 1152 to record samples during observation rounds. Prepare enough forms inadvance to accommodate the entire sampling period. Completed AF Forms 1152 and AF Forms 1157will be furnished to the study team if requested in the measurement plan. 15.15.2.  Procedures for preparing and completing the AF Form 1152 are standardized. The formatallows flexibility for tailoring observations to specific work centers. For example, columns are fur-nished to record observation times and rows are furnished to record names or codes, ratings, and dailyprocess totals. When additional columns or rows are needed, input teams may use a general-purposeform for recording observations. Table 15.1. tells how to prepare and complete the AF Form 1152. 262AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003Table 15.1.  How to Prepare AF Form 1152, Daily Work Sampling Observation (See Notes).

Daily WS observation data is considered sensitive information andis not releasable by name. These practices may be followed to maintain confidentiality. 15.16.1.  Cut out personnel names and identification on the AF Form 1152 after the samples have beentotaled. As an alternative, black out names and make a copy. 15.16.2.  Use codes for identification in lieu of names. 15.16.3.  Devise a code for idle and sensitive processes. Use codes familiar to other technicians. Mem-orize codes for productive indirect and nonproductive categories and omit the legend on the form. 15.16.4.  Place a sheet of bond paper over the form while sampling. 15.17.  WS Data Leveling.  15.17.1.  Pace rating is used to determine a leveling factor. The leveling factor is used to adjust pro-ductive time to a norm. Many processes do not lend themselves to rating, for example, supervisionand mental work. Also, the technician must be proficient with rating and familiar with the job to rateeffectively. The nature of selecting inputs from a cross section of installations, coupled with the stan-dard development process of using least squares regression, helps ensure the norm. Pace rating for WSstudies is a study team option. If pace rating is used, the study team specifies the pace rating range inthe measurement plan. Rate at least 25 percent of the process observations for ratable processes. Ifpace rating is not used, the leveling factor is 1.00. Procedures described in these paragraphs may beamplified in the measurement plan. 15.17.2.  In pace rating, the technician compares the observed pace (speed) of work done to a prede-termined normal pace. He or she then considers the difficulty of each step and mentally adjusts toallow for inherent job difficulties. Use unity (1.00) as the numerical value for the normal pace, andgive all ratings a value in relation to 1. For example, the technician may give a rating of .95 to a certainobservation. This rating shows that, at the time the worker was observed, he or she was doing at aspeed five percent SLOWER than normal for the observed activity. Conversely, a rating of 1.05 showsthe worker was doing at a speed five percent FASTER than normal. 15.17.3.  The terms pace rating and performance rating are used interchangeably in the MEP. Averag-ing these ratings for individual workers results in a leveling factor that is applied to productive time.Leveling is limited to the observed activity. In the MEP, it is used only in WS and time study. 15.17.4.  To be pace rated, the job must be repetitive and production oriented (producing an end prod-uct). The concept of normal pace can then be compared to a greater or lesser pace. 266AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 200315.17.5.  Pace rating results in a number of separate ratings. At the end of the study, find the averageof these ratings (leveling factor) and use this average to figure leveled time. This example shows thecomputation of a leveling factor from six separate pace rating values.

Allowance Factor Computation.  15.18.1.  Allowances are computed to recognize personal, rest, and unavoidable delay (PR&D). Use afixed allowance factor when PR&D do not vary considerably between processes of work. A standardfixed allowance factor for personal and rest based on two 15-minute breaks per day is considered real-istic and liberal for most work centers. The standard fixed allowance factor is 1.067 when computedper paragraph 15.18.3. Additional allowance is authorized for work centers that justify additional restor unavoidable delay. Furnish full justification and computation in the final report when the allowancefactor exceeds the standard fixed allowance. 15.18.2.  Allowances are applied at the process level for WS studies. When the fixed allowance factoris used for the work center, apply it to all productive, leveled processes. When a larger allowance fac-tor is computed, apply it only to the affected process. Use the fixed allowance factor for the remainingproductive processes. Following are two ways for determining allowance factors (in priority order): 15.18.2.1.  The study team determines whether the fixed factor is pertinent. If it isn't, the studyteam computes the allowance factor according to paragraph 15.18.3.. The allowance factor, fixedor computed, is evaluated during test measurement and then coordinated with the OPR. The coor-dinated allowance factor is then put in the measurement plan for all input locations to use. Inputlocations that do not use the allowance factor supplied by the study team must furnish full justifi-cation and computation for the factor used in their measurement reports. 15.18.2.2.  Input locations determine their own allowance factor and furnish rationale and compu-tation in their measurement reports. AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 200326715.18.3.  Compute the allowance factor for PR&D with the equation:  AF =     100%     , where percentages are expressed in terms of       100% - PR&D%     the total workday. Example 1.  Compute the fixed allowance factor for 30 minutes personal and rest (P&R) as follows:  P&R = 30 min = 6.25%, where 480 equals the number of minutes             480 min                  in an 8-hour duty day, and the  Allowance Factor =    100          = 1.067.                                 100 - 6.25 Example 2.  Compute an allowance factor when 20 additional minutes of delay per day is justified for one process.  PR&D = 30 + 20 = 10.42%,                          480  Allowance Factor   =          100        = 1.116.                                         100 - 10.42 15.19.  How to Complete AF Form 1111. Transfer WS results from the AF Form 1157 to the AF Form1111. Table 15.3. has instructions on how to fill out an AF Form 1111. AF Forms 1111 sent with measure-ment reports can be computerized, typed, or handwritten. Use continuous calculations when manuallycompleting the AF Form 1111. Make sure handwritten forms are neat and legible when sent in with mea-surement reports.

The two types of control charts used with WS data are productivitycharts and workload factor control charts. 15.20.2.  Productivity Charting. 15.20.2.1.  AF Form 1111, block 4F, shows the lower and upper control limits for the study. Visualinspection of this form will show days outside these limits. However, it is difficult to furnish ratio-nale later for a day out of control when charts are not kept on a daily basis. Recompute controlcharts after each five days and at the end of the measurement period. Plot control charts daily toidentify days needing explanation at the end of the measurement. 15.20.2.2.  Exercise caution in discarding data. Do not declare data unusable simply because apoint falls beyond established limits. Clearly state a reason for not using each day's data. Investi-gate and explain all points circled on the AF Form 1111, column 3F. 15.20.2.3.  Frequently, in the first few days (possibly a week) of sampling, a greater percentage ofproductivity is observed than in the remaining days of the study. This situation is usually causedby the craftsman's presence in the work center. After personnel in the work center become accus-tomed to the craftsman, the data is usually more representative of the normal situation. When thissituation causes high productivity followed by low productivity, include both in the study. 15.20.2.4.  Consider alternating craftsmen daily and compare odd and even days. This will iden-tify any observer bias. 15.20.2.5.  Productivity charts are effective for determining representativeness of daily productiv-ity. By comparing productivity control charts with the workload factor control chart more infor-mation is apparent to the craftsman. 15.20.2.6.  A productivity chart is a graph that has a center line, upper and lower control limits(LCL), and the daily productivity to be analyzed. 15.20.2.6.1.  Center line. The center line is the average productivity for the period the chartrepresents. 15.20.2.6.2.  Control limits. Set upper and lower control limits by adding and subtracting threestandard errors of proportion from the center line. 15.20.2.7.  The same general procedures for preparing control charts (Table 15.4.) apply to alltypes of control charts. However, the computations of the needed values differ for variable data(measurements of time, length, etc.) and attribute data (percents or proportions). WS uses attributedata. AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003271Table 15.4.  Preparation Of A Control Chart. Step  Action 1 2 3 4 5 6  7 8 Clearly label both vertical and horizontal axes to indicate what is being charted. Scale the vertical axis to include the range of values to be charted. Indicate with a broken line when an axis does not go all the way to zero.  Extend the horizontal axis to allow all of the data to be charted (both current data and data to be obtained in the future). Draw a solid line to indicate the center line. Identify the value. Place dotted lines for the upper (UCL) and lower (LCL) control limits. Indicate the value of each. Plot the points to be evaluated on the control chart. Connect all of the points to aid the visual analysis by using a solid line between each of the points or by using a vertical line between each point on the X-axis. 15.20.2.8.  Attribute data is suitable for a P-chart that evaluates changes in the percent or propor-tion. The P-chart is based on the binomial distribution. This distribution uses the average quantityin computing its variation. The instructions for the needed values are in Table 15.5.. 272AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003A Table 15.5.

Label all values and each axis clearly. 15.20.3.  Workload Factor Control Charting. AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 200327315.20.3.1.  The workload factor control chart is used in combination with productivity charts.Make a workload factor control chart when the workload factor count is available on a daily basis. 15.20.3.2.  A workload factor control chart often helps determine the representativeness of thestudy period, verify the accuracy of the work count, and identify normal workloads. Developmentof a work center standard during other than normal workload periods might result in a distortion ofthe standard. Prepare the chart as follows: 15.20.3.2.1.  Get the historical workload (6 to 12 months). Then compute the average dailyhistorical workload by dividing the total workload for the period by the number of monthsincluded and then dividing the quotient by the average number of days the work center workseach month. 15.20.3.2.2.  Draw the chart on standard graph paper with days as the horizontal axis andworkload as the vertical axis. The range of days will be determined by the number of days youwish to analyze (usually the entire study period). The range of workload will be from zero tothe maximum total workload expected (add 10% for error). 15.20.3.2.3.  Multiply the average daily historical workload by the number of study daysintended, then plot the product on the vertical axis. The corresponding horizontal coordinate isthe last date to be studied. Connect this point and the origin with a solid straight line. This lineis the historical average workload line. 15.20.3.2.4.  As the study develops, plot each day's workload factor count cumulatively. 15.20.3.2.5.  The shape of the daily plot shows the work pattern. When cycles end near the his-torical average workload line, the work center is working at the average workload volume. 15.20.3.2.6.  Valuable questions in analyzing points that deviate from the historical lineinclude: Are the daily and historical counts based on the same workload factor? Check the def-inition of the workload factor. Is a regular cycle appearing? Plan to stop sampling as close aspossible to the completion of a cycle. Is productivity commensurate with high or low currentworkload compared to historical workload? Check rating factors for indications of high or lowratings. Is the unit experiencing an activity (exercise or operational test) that affects the work-load count? Is it affecting productivity? Check the P-chart to determine whether days shouldbe excluded from the study. 15.20.3.2.7.  Figure 15.1. shows an example of a workload factor control chart and the dataused to prepare it. 274AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003Figure 15.1.

Control charts are used in the MEP to determine whether or not a single population isrepresented. 15.20.4.2.  If a control chart is stable, the measurements are considered to be from the same popu-lation. Then use the average value to describe this population. A control chart is considered stableif these conditions exist: 15.20.4.2.1.  All points are scattered evenly on both sides of the center line and no points areoutside the three standard deviation control limits. 15.20.4.2.2.  Most points tend to cluster around the center line. 15.20.4.2.3.  Relatively few points are near the control limits. 15.20.4.2.4.  There are no runs of seven or more consecutive points on the same side of thecenter line. 15.20.4.3.  When any of the rules for stability are violated, further investigation is needed. Suitableresponses are needed for the instability. The value can be used, omitted, or corrected. Documentall decisions of this type. Some possible reasons for instability are: 15.20.4.3.1.  An error in the data. 15.20.4.3.2.  A different situation or population was measured. 15.20.4.3.3.  Additional work was included or excluded in the data. 15.20.4.3.4.  High or low productivity. 15.21.  Types of WS Studies.  15.21.1.  Level of Studies. Design WS studies to measure work as productive and nonproductive(level I) or at the process level (level II). 15.21.2.  Level I Studies. 15.21.2.1.  In Level I studies, samples are broadly classified as productive, nonproductive, non-available, and lunch. Sample nonproductive categories such as personal, rest, delay, and idle at thecategory level since they are easily discernible. This supplies information to support the allowancefactor and to brief the OPR. 15.21.2.2.  Use percentage estimates to distribute productive time (direct and indirect) into pro-cesses. Derive these percentage estimates through consultation with key personnel and the workcenter supervisor. Get estimates from several work center personnel to improve the reliability ofprocess distribution. Percentage estimates must equal 100%. Figure 15.2. shows an example ofestimated process distribution percentages. It assumes that estimates were obtained from the workcenter supervisor (estimate A) and the foreman (estimate B). The "percent of total" column (col-umn five) is used to distribute the productive direct time into processes. 276AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003Figure 15.2.

Level II Studies. 15.21.3.1.  Level II studies are measured at the process level. In most WS studies, it is easy to dis-tinguish between productive and nonproductive samples. The distinction between productivedirect and productive indirect is more difficult. For example, the productive direct process of man-agement is similar to the productive indirect processes of supervision and administration whenobserved at the task level of accomplishment. If a sample is misclassified as direct when it is reallyindirect, there is no change to total productive time. 15.21.3.2.  Because measured indirect time is based on observations, do not use SIAMs with WSstudies. Do not compromise standard studies based on observation by comparing their economicswith the economics for standard studies based on nonmeasurement methods. 15.21.3.2.1.  Productive direct time is sampled at Level I and prorated by percentages to getdirect process and indirect category time, and 15.21.3.2.2.  Productive indirect time is sampled at Level II (category level). AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003277Chapter 16 QUEUEING 16.1.  General Concepts.  16.1.1.  A queue is defined as a waiting line. Queue analysis involves a mathematical study of waitinglines. 16.1.2.  A queueing system refers to the entire process of a customer arriving, being served, and leav-ing. Figure 16.1. illustrates the basic steps of a queueing system. Figure 16.1.  General Flow of a Queueing System. 16.1.3.  A specific definition is needed to understand the term customer. It is used in a general senseand does not necessarily refer to a human customer. A customer could be: 16.1.3.1.  An airplane waiting to be refueled. 16.1.3.2.  A computer program waiting to be run. 16.1.3.3.  A ball bearing waiting to be inspected. 16.1.4.  Traditional work measurement techniques apply to a situation where the next item to be pro-cessed is available when the worker is ready to start. In situations where workload develops randomly,queueing theory applies. Examples of such areas are: 16.1.4.1.  Checkout cashiers in the commissary. 16.1.4.2.  Forklift truck operators. 16.1.4.3.  Personnel who check out records such as in a hospital or Military Personnel Flight(MPF) 16.1.4.4.  Tool crib attendants. 16.1.4.5.  Clerks who set up telephone appointments. 16.1.4.6.  Drivers for the base taxi service. 16.1.4.7.  Inventory items in a warehouse. 278AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 200316.1.5.  A queueing model does not make decisions. It provides information to base decisions on. Itcan tell you the probability of waiting or not waiting. It can also determine the average number ofunits to be served and the average time spent in the queue. Given any of these as the selection criteria,you can decide what level of performance is acceptable. For example, you can determine the numberof cashiers needed to make sure a desired average waiting time. On the other hand, you can measurean arrival rate to setup an appointment system. 16.1.6.  The primary intent of this chapter is to relate queueing analysis to the MEP. General proce-dures are presented to give direction to the analysis and a feel for queueing situations. Due to the com-plexity of the subject matter, the specific details are omitted and textbooks are referenced at the end ofthis chapter. A team desiring to use this method should either have a person on the team who knowsqueueing theory or seek advice from such a person. 16.2.  Information Needed.  16.2.1.  Queueing Analysis. Before doing any queueing analysis carefully study the entire queueingsystem. Figure 16.2. presents the type of information needed to do a queueing study. Figure 16.2.  Types of Information Needed in Queueing. 16.2.2.  Customer Population. The size of the customer population (either finite or infinite) is basicallya count of the actual population. A customer population that is fixed in size is finite. However, whena finite population is large enough not to be affected by the service capacity of the system, then thepopulation is essentially infinite. Most queueing systems have finite customer populations and areAFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003279correctly assumed to be infinite. Unless the population is infinite (or can be assumed to be infinite),the probability of a customer arriving for service changes is based on the number of customers alreadyin the system. For example: 16.2.2.1.  Consider repairing lathes. The machine shop has five lathes (customer population equalsfive). These machines break down occasionally (arrive for service). Two repairmen (servers) areassigned to that shop. The down machine will be repaired and put back in service. This is consid-ered a finite source. While one machine is down, the customer population is not the same (onlyfour remain in service). 16.2.2.2.  A Similar Machine. Now assume a similar machine shop has included a sufficient num-ber of spare machines. When one machine is down, a spare is immediately substituted. Hence, thecustomer population is constant at five, even if one is down. 16.2.2.3.  Next, consider a commissary. The customer population is finite because only peoplewith commissary privileges are customers. However, this population is large when compared tothe service capacity of the commissary. In effect, it is inexhaustible (infinitely large). 16.2.3.  Number of Service Channels. 16.2.3.1.  Service channels are concerned not only with the number of service facilities but alsowith the associated queues. A queue is characterized by the maximum number of customers it canhold. When a given number of customers are waiting in a queue, future customers are denied entryinto the queue until others are served. This is a finite queue. An infinite queue does not have suchrestrictions. 16.2.3.2.  A single service channel usually has only one queue or waiting line. 16.2.3.3.  Multiple service channels can have one queue, such as a barbershop with multiple bar-bers and a general waiting area where customers are served on a first-come, first-served basis. 16.2.3.4.  Multiple service channels can also each be served by a different queue, such as a super-market with several checkers. 16.2.4.  Queue Discipline. 16.2.4.1.  This refers to the method that customers are selected from the queue to be served. Someof the common disciplines are: 16.2.4.1.1.  First-come, first-served. The next available server services the first customer in thequeue line. 16.2.4.1.2.  Priority. A customer is given some sort of priority on entering the queue. Thosewith higher priorities are served before those with lower priorities. Two types of priority arepreemptive and head-of-line. Preemptive priority is when a customer with high priority isallowed to enter the service channel immediately even if a customer with a lower priority isbeing serviced. Head-of-line priority puts a higher priority customer at the head of the line, butdoes not preempt any ongoing service. 16.2.4.1.3.  Random selection. Selection is independent of arrival time. 16.2.4.1.4.  Bulk selection. A group of customers are selected at one time. 280AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 200316.2.4.2.  Queue disciplines alter when customers do not behave as expected. Two examples arewhen a customer jumps from one channel to another and when a customer balks (turns around andleaves instead of waiting in line for service). 16.2.5.  Arrival and Service Patterns. 16.2.5.1.  The arrival pattern of customers to a queueing system can be described by one of these. 16.2.5.1.1.  The average number of arrivals to the system per some unit of time (mean arrivalrate). 16.2.5.1.2.  The average time between successive arrivals (mean interarrival time). 16.2.5.2.  The service pattern of customers within a nonempty queueing system can be describedby: 16.2.5.2.1.  The average number of customers served per some unit of time (mean servicerate). 16.2.5.2.2.  The average time to service a customer (mean service time). 16.2.5.3.  Similarities and relationships exist between these two types of distinct patterns. Studyboth patterns in depth to adequately describe a queueing system. 16.2.5.4.  The random occurrences within each of these patterns will follow a particular statisticaldistribution. The identification of the distribution may or may not be straightforward. In favorablesituations, when the arrival rates follow a Poisson distribution and the service time follows anexponential distribution, straightforward queueing formulas can be used. Knowing, recognizing,and using these distributions involve mathematical sophistication that is beyond the scope of thischapter. A general example is provided in the remainder of this chapter to illustrate the flow of onequeueing analysis without detailing all of the mathematical steps. 16.3.  Collecting Information.  16.3.1.  In queueing analysis, the information collected can be categorized in two broad categories -general information and numerical information. 16.3.2.  General information comes from an in-depth look at the queueing system that includes evalu-ating the customer population limit, the queue discipline used, and the number of parallel servicechannels. This type of information appears easy to obtain, but a careful study of the situation mayuncover some subtle differences embedded in the system. For example, recall the comments in theprevious paragraph about infinite versus finite customer populations. 16.3.3.  Numerical information is a general grouping that includes collecting and analyzing the distri-bution of service times, arrivals, and times between arrivals. Needed numerical data are the exacttimes that customers arrive at a system for service and the actual service times. The method of collect-ing this data (either through measurement or from historical files) depends on the availability of dataand the type of standard to be built. 16.3.3.1.  Historical data, such as dispatch logs and job-supervisors records, may provide theneeded information. Verify the data for accuracy and representativeness. For example, does theservice time include standby time? AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 200328116.3.3.2.  Measurement is the most common source of data. Design a procedure for gathering thisdata for both the service time and the arrival rate (or interarrival time) for the particular work cen-ter being studied. One of several methods or a combination of methods may be used. 16.3.3.2.1.  Use a stopwatch to measure the amount of time needed to give service. Time onlythe actual time spent giving service, from the second it starts to the second it finishes. 16.3.3.2.2.  Use a log to show the exact time a customer arrives for service. Compute thearrival rates from such a log by counting how many customers arrived in a given block of time(e.g., per each 10 minutes). 16.3.3.2.3.  Use a log to record when service begins and ends. An example could be a dispatch-ing log used at a base taxi service. 16.3.3.2.4.  There are many other methods that may be more suitable for the situation beingstudied. Remember, the quality of this input data is extremely important because it will formthe basis for analysis. 16.3.4.  Consider a tool crib as the setting of a queueing analysis. It is decided to obtain informationabout the arrivals of mechanics at the tool crib by using a log to account for the number of arrivals pereach 10 minutes. Information about the time it takes an attendant to wait on a mechanic is obtainedwith actual timings. 16.4.  Evaluating Data.  16.4.1.  Analyze information about arrival and service data separately, but the procedures are the samein both cases. 16.4.2.  Arrange and organize the data in a frequency table. This will prepare the data for the chisquare goodness-of-fit test. Make sure the number of categories in the frequency table reflect the situ-ation (for example, when talking about the number of arrivals per block of time, begin with 0 arrivals,l arrival, etc.). Usually between 8 and 20 categories are sufficient. 16.4.3.  Construct a histogram of the data to provide a visual method for estimating how well this datais exhibiting the properties of the desired distribution. 16.4.4.  Do the chi square goodness-of-fit test to determine whether the data can be considered fromthe desired probability distribution. Group some of the categories together to make sure the expectedfrequency in each cell is at least 5. Find the details of this test in the references listed at the end of thischapter. 16.4.4.1.  If the data passes the goodness-of-fit test, use the mean time from this data in furtheranalysis. 16.4.4.2.  If the data does not pass this test, do one of the following steps: 16.4.4.2.1.  Reevaluate the data (collection method, accuracy, and representativeness of thedata) to discover possible errors. 16.4.4.2.2.  Resort to more complex modeling of this queueing system. This may require bothmore theoretical knowledge and extensive computer support for simulation of the problem. 16.4.5.  The arrival rates for our tool crib example have been gathered by counting the number ofarrivals per ten minutes. One hundred observations were made. The data is tested to see if these arrival282AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003rates follow a Poisson distribution (Figure 16.3.). The data passes the test and we conclude that thearrival distribution is Poisson. The average value for the arrival rate (l ) can then be used in furtheranalysis:         l  = 16.04 arrivals per ten minutes or         l  = 96.24 arrivals per hour AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003283Figure 16.3.

Therefore, it passes the CHI SQUARE test.  This data can be represented by a Poisson distribution with a mean of 16.04. -  5.948   0.6380  16.4.6.  Figure 16.4. presents a histogram of this example data and the data represented by theexpected frequency. 284AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003Figure 16.4.  Histogram of Example Data. 16.4.7.  The service times for this example are tested to determine if they follow an exponential distri-bution. The details of this analysis are not presented in this chapter. For this example, assume it passesthe test for an exponential distribution. Since the average service time is determined to be .7496 min-utes per customer, the average service rate is the reciprocal of .7496 or:         m = 1.334 customers per minute        m = 80.04 customers per hour 16.4.8.  The utilization factor (r) for a queueing system is defined as the mean arrival rate (l) dividedby the service capacity of the system. The service capacity of the system is the mean service rate (m)times the number of service channels (c) in the system. Hence, r= l/cm The utilization factor repre-sents the proportion of the total service capacity needed to service the customers. If r> 1 , then thecustomers are arriving at a faster rate than they can be served, and queues will build indefinitely. Insuch a situation, either l, c, or m must be changed to get r< 1. For example, more servers (increase c)can be added to meet the needs of the system, or labor-efficient equipment can be incorporated toserve more per unit time (increase m). 16.4.9.  The utilization factor for the tool crib when it is operated with only one attendant (c = l) isgreater than one: AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003285  l 96.24     (r=      cm =    80.04  = l.2024).  Therefore, the mechanics will always have to wait since one attendant is not able to wait on them fast enough. Hence, more than one attendant is needed. 16.5.  Combining Information.  16.5.1.  After the service times and arrival rates have been identified as coming from a relevant distri-bution, this numerical information can be joined with the general information already obtained. 16.5.2.  See Figure 16.5. for a simplistic picture that relates common queueing terms to the generalqueueing system. 286AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003Figure 16.5.  Simplified Relationship Between Queueing System and Definitions. 16.5.3.  When the most favorable situations exist (identified under Major Assumptions in Figure16.6.), the formulas in that figure apply. AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003287Figure 16.6.  Queueing Formulas. MAJOR ASSUMPTIONS: 1.      The arrival rate follows a Poisson distribution.   2.    The service time follows an exponential distribution.   3.    The system is considered to be a "steady state" system.  This is an ongoing system instead of one that is just starting up (in transition).   4.    The queue discipline used is "first-come-first-served."  DEFINITIONS: l m  (Lamda) Average rate per unit of time at which customers arrive at the queueing system (e.g., 6 per hour).* (Mu) Average rate per unit of time at which each service channel provided service (e.g., 1 per minute or 60 per hour).* c  Number of service channels in the queueing system. r (Rho) Utilization factor defined as:            r =   l                                                                               cm W  Mean time in system; average amount of time one customer spends in the queueing system (waiting and being served). Wq  Mean time in queue; average amount of time one customer spends in the queue (waiting only). L  Mean line length; average number of customers in the queueing system (waiting and being served).   Lq  Mean queue length; average number of customers in the queue (waiting only). Po  Probability of no one being in the queueing system at a given point in time (to be used in computations).   *  Remember:  Units of time must be the same for all computations.   FORMULA  (for use when the above assumptions are met):                        W = Wq + 1/m            Lq  = Wql         L = Wl    288AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 200316.5.4.  When different queueing systems are identified, obtain the needed formulas from a queueingtextbook. 16.6.  Average Costs of Various Systems.  16.6.1.  A queue will form any time a customer arrives for service and all of the servers are busy. Moreservers can be added to eliminate the queueing problem. Since customers arrive at random times, eachadditional server will also result in an increase in idle time. This will increase the operational costs. 16.6.2.  The total cost of a system can be viewed as the cost of service and the cost of waiting. Figure16.7. shows that as the level of service is increased (for example, adding more service channels), thecost of providing the service also increases. However, as the level of service is increased, customersdo not have to wait as long for service and the cost of waiting decreases. The curve of the total coststarts out decreasing. This shows that adding more servers cuts waiting time enough to lower the totalcost. However, the total cost curve reaches its minimum and then increases. This shows additionalservers after that point are a waste of money. Note that the minimum total cost does not have to occurat the intersection of waiting and service costs. Figure 16.7.  Cost Model. 16.6.2.1.  The cost of service is normally found by multiplying the number of servers by their sal-ary rate. For example, if three servers are needed and each is paid $3.50 per hour, the cost of ser-vice is 3 times $3.50 or $10.50 per hour. 16.6.2.2.  The cost of waiting may often be difficult to compute. We must recognize that there aredifferent types of costs involved in waiting. AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 200328916.6.2.2.1.  For example, what is the cost of an aircraft waiting to be loaded during an emer-gency? While we may not be able to quantify this type of cost, other costs of waiting can bequantified. 16.6.2.2.2.  There is the obvious cost of the salary paid to the person standing in line, waitingfor service. This person is idle (not being productive), thus creating a waiting cost. 16.6.2.2.3.  Similarly, an aircraft in a holding pattern is using extra fuel while waiting to land.Also, if several people work with a machine that breaks down, they are idle until the machineis repaired. 16.6.2.2.4.  Finally, there are intangible costs such as decreased morale because a person hadto wait too long for service at the Military Personnel Flight (MPF) or gymnasium. A customermay refuse to wait and leave the system. 16.6.3.  When arrival and service rates can be held constant, the number of service channels can bevaried to see their effect on the number of customers waiting for service and on the average waitingtime. In this situation, the total cost of alternate systems can be compared. 16.6.4.  Because the major assumptions have been met for our tool crib example, use the straightfor-ward formulas in Figure 16.6.. It has already been determined that one attendant at the tool crib can-not meet the needs of the mechanics. Would two attendants be enough? Three? Four? 16.6.4.1.  In our example, to compute the cost of waiting, we need two additional values: the aver-age number of mechanics waiting and the average amount of time each waits. ("In the system"refers to both waiting in the queue and being served.) Calculate these two values separately for sit-uations where there are two, three, and four servers. Figure 16.8. shows step-by-step calculationsfor three servers. It also shows the average times for two, three, and four servers. 290AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003Figure 16.8.  Computation of Average Waiting Time and Average Number of Customers. 16.6.4.2.  When this information is combined, make an economical decision about the number ofattendants (or servers) to use, given that the service rate and arrival rate do not change.

Uses of Queueing Analysis.  16.7.1.  Manpower Standards. Use queueing analysis to determine the number of requirementsallowed by a manpower standard when the acceptable level of service is known. 16.7.2.  Management Consultant Studies. In management consultant studies, the main thrust of aqueueing study is directed more toward improving the productivity rather than determining manpowerrequirements. Queueing analysis can provide the potential improvement results of changing the aver-age service times or the number of servers. 16.8.  Queueing Analysis References.

Variance—A condition that exists that either adds to or subtracts from the core workload, or impacts theAFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003305way the work is performed. A variance can be the result of environmental, mission or technologicaldifferences, and can be either negative or positive. 1. Environmental  Variance.  Accounts  for  different  operating  conditions  from  those  used  todevelop  the  core  manpower  standard  (e.g.,  snow,  geographical  separation,  etc.).  It  can  eitherincrease (positive) or decrease (negative) requirements. 2. Mission Variance. Accounts for different  operating  processes from  those used  to develop  thecore  manpower  requirements.  It  can  either  increase  (positive)  or  decrease  (negative)  require-ments. 3. Technological Variance. Accounts for different operating equipment from those used to developthe core manpower requirements. It can either increase (positive) or decrease (negative) require-ments. Variation—A measure of the dispersion or scattering of values about the mean of a distribution. Work Center—A group of personnel that use similar machines, processes, methods, and operations to dohomogeneous work usually located in a centralized area. The term is used to identify a relatively smallactivity within a broad functional segment. Personnel within a work center do work that basicallycontributes to the same end product or result (duties are similar or closely related). Work Count—The number of work units done during a specified time period. Work Cycle—1. A  pattern  or  sequence  of  tasks,  operations,  or  processes  with  a  distinct  beginning  and  endingpoint. 2. A pattern of manual motions, elements, activities, or operations that are repeated without signifi-cant variation each time a unit of work is completed. Work Distribution Analysis—A technique to improve production that helps find out what work is beingdone, how much time is spent on it, and who is doing it. Work Flow—The flow or movement of things being processed from one operation to another. Work Measurement—Process to obtain data necessary to compute accurate manpower requirements.Techniques include work sampling, time study, and good operator timing and technical estimate. Usuallyresults in a manpower standard or guide. Work Sampling—The application of statistical sampling theory and techniques to the study of worksystems. The characteristics of the sampled (observed) work done are used to produce estimates of theamounts of work and types of activity done. Work sampling data can be used in conjunction withassociated work counts to compute standards. Work Unit—The basic identification of work accomplished or services performed. Work units should beeasy to identify; convenient for obtaining productive count; and usable for scheduling, planning, andcosting. Syn: Workload Factor. Workload—An expression of the amount of work, identified by the number of work units or volume of aworkload factor, that a work center has on hand at any given time or is responsible for doing during aspecified period of time. 306AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003Workload Factor (WLF)—1. An  index  or  unit  of  measure  that  is  consistently  expressive  of,  or  relatable  to,  the  manpowerrequired to accomplish the quantitatively and qualitatively defined responsibilities of a work cen-ter. 2. An end product (or a combination of products) that represents the work done in the work center. Itmay be either something physically produced in the work center (referred to as a production-typeWLF) or something that is external to, but served by, the work center (referred to as a work gener-ator-type WLF). AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003307Attachment 2 STATISTICAL TABLES Critical Values (F*) for the F-test - Two Tables are contained here. One is for 90% confidence (Table A2.1.) and the other for 95% confi-dence (Table A2.2.). - This test is primarily used for the MEP to decide if a regression equation explains a significant amountof the variation. Critical Values (t*) for the t-test. - This test is used in regression analysis to determine if an individual variable contributes significantly tothe overall equation. - When the sample size (n) gets very large (¥), the values on the t-Table become the same as the valuesfound on a normal Z-Table. Therefore, values in this t-Table corresponding with df = ¥ can be used for theZ values when n > 30. Table A2.1.  Critical Values For The F-Test. Definitions:    1.  df1  =  degrees of freedom for the numerator (m - 1 )*    2.  df2  =  degrees of freedom for the denominator (n - m)*    3.  (1 - a)% = per cent of confidence in the results of this test    * From regression analysis, m is the number of regression coefficients estimated and n is the number of data sets.

Paragraphs 13.5 through 13.8.5.2 are all new paragraphs to Chapter 13, STAN-DARD INDIRECT ALLOWED MAN-HOURS (SIAM). 13.5. Alternate Indirect Man-Hour Measurement Methods: 13.5.1. In addition to the SIAM, several other standard indirect measurement methods are available to provide flexibility in responding to the dynamic expeditionary nature of our aerospace forces. These tools include the Standard Indirect Allowed Man-Hour Equation (SIAME), Direct and Indirect Manpower Equation (DIME) and the Capabilities Based Manpower Determinant (CBMD) Standard Indirect Allow-ance Factor (SIAF). 13.5.1.1. The Air Force is transforming to a capabilities-focused Expeditionary Air and Space Force. In doing so, our goal is to make warfighting effects, and the capabilities we need to achieve them, the drivers for everything we do. In addressing this Air Force goal, we define manpower requirements in an environ-ment of global engagement with expeditionary forces performing capabilities. We call this manpower quantification the CBMD. 13.5.1.2. The CBMD SIAF is designed to address indirect man-hours or indirect fractional manning when computing a CBMD manpower requirement. The DIME is designed to address indirect man-hours or fractional manning when combining all CBMDs for a determination of manpower requirements at the organizational level or function. 13.5.2. Each tool is discussed in detail in the following paragraphs. Table 13.1, Standard Indirect Mea-surement Tools Decision Logic Table, describes the advantages and disadvantages of each tool and when they are recommended for use. 314AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003TABLE 13.1. Standard Indirect Measurement Tools Decision Logic Table Method SIAM Recommended Employment To measure indirect man-hours for traditional peacetime manpower standards. SIAME Same as SIAM. DIME To quantify total CBMD manpower for a function.  Since DIME was developed as a relationship of indirect requirement to direct requirement (while the SIAM and SIAME based on current assigned personnel), a recommended tool for computing indirect requirements for Most Efficient Organization (MEO).  Also recommended for “to be” organizational models especially when significantly different from the “as is” POD. Advantage Most Accurate for non-CBMD manpower studies. Disadvantage Slightly time consuming. Not designed for CBMD studies. Quicker than SIAM.    Not designed for CBMD studies. Quick method to determine total CBMD FTEs for a function. Not as accurate as SIAM. Not intended for application until completion of all associated CBMD studies. CBMD SIAF  To quantify CBMD indirect man-hours or indirect fractional manpower.  Also, a recommended tool for computing indirect requirements once direct requirements have been determined for relatively small mission changes or efficiencies. Quick method to determine incremental indirect man-hours for a single CBMD. Not as accurate as total measurement or SIAM. 13.6. Standard Indirect Allowed Man-Hour Equation (SIAME) 13.6.1. The SIAME is an alternate method of crediting indirect man-hours for Operational Audit and Time Study standards. Direct and SIAME man-hours are added to determine total monthly man-hours for work centers of five or more assigned personnel. 13.6.2. The SIAME was developed using the FAC family approach. Functional areas were analyzed by reviewing the primary mission, types of specialties used, and organizational levels within the function. Associated FACs were then grouped into SIAME families using the following definitions: AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 200331513.6.2.1. Management and Administration Work Centers. These work centers have the primary function of managing subordinate organizational elements and providing unit administrative support. Examples include the medical support squadron’s personnel and administration flight, the civil engineer unit admin-istration and the operations squadron’s operations officer and the maintenance officer. 13.6.2.2. Production and Staff Support Work Centers. These work centers have the primary function of supporting the production area of an organization and researching, evaluating, reporting, coordinating, and advising. Examples include the wing manpower and organization office, the comptroller squadron financial analysis flight, the civil engineering or services squadron’s resource management flights and the medical support squadron’s medical information services flight. 13.6.2.3. Customer Service Work Centers. These work centers have the primary function of providing specific services to customers. Examples include the military and civilian personnel flights, base billeting, military pay and travel. 13.6.2.4. Medical Work Centers. These work centers include medical facilities and dental services. 13.6.2.5. Warehouse, Storage, and Issue. These work centers have the primary function of receiving, stor-ing, or issuing material. Examples include the supply squadron material storage and distribution flight and fuels management flight. 13.6.2.6. Industrial Shop.

The standards development team develops a direct manpower equation, Y(Dir), using measured direct time and an indirect equation, Y (SIAME), using the selected SIAME and the average number of assigned work center personnel as the workload factor. The direct equation results are added to the SIAME results to derive the total monthly man-hours. 13.6.3.4.1. Application Example: Using a notional Y(Dir) = 300 + 5.6555X equation, Y(Dir) = 300 + 5.6555X (Where X(Dir) = Workload Factor = 250 Vehicles Assigned). Y(Dir) = 300 + 5.6555(250) = 1713.88. Y (SIAME)  = 270.13 + 9.3033X (X(SIAME)  = 12 Average Assigned Personnel). Y (SIAME)  = 270.13 + 9.3033 (12) = 381.77 Indirect Man-Hours Y(Tot) = Y (DIR)  + Y (SIAME)  = Y (Tot) Y(Tot) = 1713.88 + 381.77 = 2095.65 Total Man-Hours 13.6.4. Using SIAME: 13.6.4.1. The study team must use caution when selecting the SIAME. Review the FAC family definitions in paragraphs 13.6.2.1 through 13.6.2.6 and select the SIAME that best fits the work center or function being studied. Ensure the standard indirect description reflected in AFMS00AA applies. If ANY of the indirect task definition elements are not done, or additional elements are done, a variance must be devel-oped to supplement the SIAME. In this case, you must measure this task using the SIAM task measure-ment instructions reflected on the SIAM task data sheet. These measured man-hours are then added or subtracted, as appropriate, from the results of the SIAME application. 13.6.4.2. Use logic. If the SIAME allowed time is not representative of what normally occurs in the work center the study team should measure the task using the SIAM task data sheet measurement instructions. 13.7. Direct & Indirect Manpower Equation (DIME) 13.7.1. The DIME is an alternate method of crediting indirect manpower for functions of five or more assigned personnel that has quantified total direct manpower requirements. 13.7.2.

Table 13.3, SIAME, DIME, & SIAF Listing by FAC, reflects the DIME for each individual FAC. 13.7.2. Terms and Symbols 13.7.2.1. Y(Dir) = Direct manpower from application of a manpower equation and subsequent conversion to a manpower requirement by applying the applicable MAF. 13.7.2.2. Y(DIME) = Total manpower requirement by applying the direct manpower (Y(Dir)) in the applica-ble DIME. 13.7.2.3. Application. Prior to using the DIME model it is necessary to quantify the total functional direct manpower (Y(DIR)). This is accomplished by determining the total direct required monthly man-hours for the function and dividing by the appropriate MAF. The study team selects the appropriate DIME (Y(DIME)) model (See Table 13.3 ) and applies direct manpower as the independent variable. The DIME produces the total direct and indirect manpower. 13.7.2.4. Application Example: Using a notional Y(Dir) = 300 + 5.6555X equation, Y(Dir) = 300 + 5.6555X (Where X(Dir) = Workload Factor = 250 Vehicles Assigned). Y(Dir) = 300 + 5.6555(250) = 1713.88 Direct Man-Hours. 1713.88/149.6 = 11.46 Direct Manpower Y (DIME)  = 1.81 + 1.0681X (Where X  = Direct Manpower). Y (DIME)  = 1.81 + 1.0681 (11.46) = 14.05 Total Functional Manpower Requirement. 330AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 200313.7.3. Using DIME: 13.6.3.1.

Capability Based Manpower Determinant (CBMD) Standard Indirect Allowance Factor (SIAF). 13.8.1. The CBMD SIAF is a simple tool that quantifies the incremental indirect man-hours required for each CBMD resource (i.e., Security Forces, Personnel, Medical, etc.). 13.8.2. Table 13.5, Air Force CBMD SIAF Families, reflects the SIAF for each FAC family. AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003331TABLE 13.5.

Multiply the SIAF by the CBMD Direct Man-hours and divide by the applicableMAF to compute the CBMD FTEs. OR 2. Multiply the CBMD Direct FTE by the SIAF to compute the total CBMD FTE. OR 3. Multiply the SIAF by the regression coefficients of the CBMD Y(CBMD DIR) equa-tion (if available).  For example: Y(CBMD DIR) = a + bX, Y(CBMD Total) = a (SIAF) +b(SIAF)X.  X = CBMD specific workload factor. 13.8.3. Table 13.3, SIAME, DIME, & SIAF Listing by FAC, reflects the SIAF for each individual FAC. 13.8.4. Terms and Symbols 13.8.4.1. CBMD Direct Man-hours = Direct man-hours for each CBMD. 13.8.4.2. SIAF = Standard Indirect Allowance Factor. 13.8.4.3. Application. Application of the SIAF results in the total monthly man-hour requirement which may be converted to a full time equivalent (FTE) by dividing the man-hours by the applicable man-hour availability factor (MAF). The study team selects the appropriate SIAF and applies it to the respective direct man-hours. 13.8.4.4. Application Example: The study team selects the appropriate CBMD SIAF (i.e. Security Forces = SIAF 1.0785, Military Personnel Flight = 1.0610, Emergency Room = SIAF 1.0699) and multiplies it times the CBMD Direct Man-hours, if available. This value is divided by the appropriate MAF to deter-mine the FTE. Sum all FTEs to determine the CBMD total FTE requirement. If the CBMD Direct FTE has been defined, the study team multiplies this value by the respective SIAF to determine the total CBMD FTE. If a CBMD Direct man-hour equation has been developed, apply the SIAF as reflected in Table 13.6, CBMD SIAF Application. 332AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 2003Table 13. 6. CBMD SIAF Application Example. A.  Multiply the SIAF by the CBMD Direct Man-hours and divide by the applicable MAF to compute the CBMD FTEs.

Multiply the SIAF by the regression coefficients of the CBMD Y(CBMD DIR) equation (if available).  For example: Y(CBMD DIR) = a + bX, Y(Total) = a (SIAF) + b(SIAF).  Y(CBMD DIR) = 309.12 + 5.6555X, Y(Total) = 309.12 (1.0785) + 5.6555(1.0785)X, Y(Total) = 333.39 + 6.099X, Where X = 210 widgets, Y(Total) = 333.39 + 6.099(210), Y(Total) = 1614.18, CBMD FTE = 1614.18/Applicable MAF = 1614.18/149.6 = 10.79 FTE 10.79 4.27 4.27 1.08 3.57 23.98       13.8.5. Using the CBMD SIAF: 13.8.5.1. The study team must use caution when selecting the CBMD SIAF. Review the FAC family def-initions in paragraphs 13.6.2.1 through 13.6.2.6 and select the SIAF that best fits the work center or func-tion being studied. Ensure the standard indirect description reflected in AFMS 00AA applies. If ANY of the indirect task definition elements are not done, or additional elements are done, the SIAF CANNOT be used. You must measure the indirect workload using the SIAM task measurement instructions reflected on the SIAM task data sheet. AFMAN38-208V2   19 NOVEMBER 200333313.8.5.2. Use logic. If the SIAF allowed time is not representative of what normally occurs in the CBMD defined environment the study team should measure the task using the SIAM task data sheet measurement instructions.
