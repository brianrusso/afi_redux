Air  Force  leadership  is  committed  to  providing  outstanding  support  services  to GOs  while  they  reside  in  government-owned/leased  and  privatized  housing  at  Air  Force installations. As the executor of the Air Force GOQ Program, the Housing Management Teams should provide a level of customer service that enhances support for GO residents. 2.2.  Policy.  See AFI 32-6001 for general housing policy and additional information. 2.2.1.  Joint  Basing.  At joint base operations, organizations providing housing support will ensure  GOQs  are  managed  IAW  management  and  operations  policies,  and  provision  of services and resources, as defined in a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) and installation implementation plans, and as agreed to by the supporting and supported Components. (T-0) 2.2.2.  Accessibility.  Ensure new or renovated GOQs are adaptable to accessibility standards of  the  Architectural  Barriers  Act  (ABA)  and  Americans  with  Disability  Act  (ADA)  for privatized properties.   2.2.3.  Key  and  Essential  (K&E),  Command  and  Special  Command  Positions (SCP).  The  Commander  establishes  a  K&E  position  only  when  there  is  a  compelling  need for  a  member  to  live  on  base.  For  example,  incumbent  is  required  to  respond  to  continual operational requirements or emergencies and off-base residency would adversely impact the installation readiness, safety  and security or health and welfare of the base population.  The Commander will identify K&E positions in a supplement to AFI 32-6001. (T-0)  Additional guidance on designating housing for K&E, SCP and Command positions is provided in AFI 32-6001, Paragraph. 2.20.  2.2.4.  GOQ  Retention.  Under  certain  circumstances,  described  below,  residents  of  GOQs may request retention of family housing. 2.2.4.1.  Government  Owned  or  Leased  GOQ.  When  a  member  occupying  a  GOQ departs  the  installation  on  an  Unaccompanied  Dependent  Restricted  (UDR)  tour,  make every effort to adequately house the incoming family while ensuring as little disruption as possible to family of the departing member. The Commander may allow family members to  retain  the  GOQ,  with  current  furnishings  and  amenities,  unless  compelling circumstances require immediate occupancy by incoming GOs.  If a move to another unit is  necessary  to  support  the  family  of  the  departing  member,  furnishings  may  not  be provided  as  the  GO  no  longer  requires  furnishings  to  support  official  entertainment responsibilities. 2.2.4.2.  Privatized  GOQ.  When  a  member  occupying  a  privatized  GOQ  departs  the installation on a UDR tour, the privatized housing property manager, in coordination with the  Commander,  determines  if  the  family  members  may  retain  housing.  In  these  cases, the  member  is  no  longer  considered  a  “target  tenant”  and  quarters  may  be  required  to support incoming personnel. If a move to another unit is necessary to support the family of the departing member, furnishings may not be provided, as the GO no longer requires furnishings to support official entertainment responsibilities.     AFI32-6003  14 APRIL 2016 13 2.3.  Housing Management Office (HMO). 2.3.1.  Installation  GOQ  management  is  the  responsibility  of  the  HMO,  aligned  under  the Installation  Management  Flight  within  the  CE  Squadron.  It  is  important  that  GOQ management  duties  are  performed  by  highly  motivated  and  trained  personnel  dedicated  to ensuring residents receive quality service. 2.3.2.  At bases with government-owned/leased GOQs, HMOs earn manpower based on Air Force  Manpower  Standard  (AFMS)  44EH.  This  manpower  standard  identifies  duties  that include, but are not limited to managing the HMO, budgeting for requirements, planning for facilities and furnishings projects, and providing education and training. 2.3.3.  At  bases  with  privatized  GOQs,  HMOs  earn  manpower  based  on  Capabilities-Based Manpower Standard (CMS) 44EHOP. This manpower standard identifies required manpower for HMOs at installations with privatized housing. Duties include, but are not limited to, HP project  oversight,  GOQ  oversight,  budget  and  financial  management,  housing  requirements identification,  housing  referral  and  relocation  services,  and  other  related  housing  services, such as GOQ cost reporting. 2.3.3.1.  Manpower  authorizations  specifically  earned  to  support  oversight  of  the  HP projects, including those identified for GOQs, are inherently governmental. 2.3.3.2.  Identify these positions on the Unit Manning Document (UMD), REASON Code (RSC) E. 2.4.  Privatized Housing Property Management Offices (Privatized Housing PMO). 2.4.1.  Provide day-to-day management of privatized GOQs. 2.4.2.  Serve as the first point of contact for privatized GOQ maintenance service calls. 2.4.3.  Coordinate government-owned furnishings allowances and delivery with HMO. 2.4.4.  Report Extraordinary Costs and Expenditures (EC&E) and other expenditure data for each GOQ for inclusion on AF Form 3826. 2.5.  General Officer Quarters (GOQ) Management Team. 2.5.1.  Structure. 2.5.1.1.  The  GOQ  Management  Team,  established  by  the  Commander  via  a  Partnering Agreement,  is  comprised  of  POCs  from  the  HMO  (includes  FMS),  Privatized  Housing PMO, and other installation agencies determined necessary to provide required services.   2.5.1.2.  The Team is the installation focal point for all GOQ matters and interfaces with other installation agencies and GOQ residents. 2.5.2.  Governance. 2.5.2.1.  Housing  Managers,  in  concert  with  team  members,  establish  and  formalize processes and procedures that: 2.5.2.1.1.  Promote excellent service and encourage positive relationships among the HMO staff, GOs and their support staffs, and Privatized Housing PMO personnel. 2.5.2.1.2.  Within  existing  policies  and  TDs,  strive  to  satisfy  resident  expectations using all available resources. 14 AFI32-6003  14 APRIL 2016 2.5.2.1.3.  Require  the  Team  to  engage  the  Commander  and  HP  ownership,  as necessary, to provide resolution for GO requirements that cannot otherwise be met. 2.5.2.1.4.  Increase Team awareness of: 2.5.2.1.4.1.  Appropriate use of military rank. 2.5.2.1.4.2.  Compliance  with  time-honored  military  traditions,  customs,  and courtesies.  2.5.2.1.4.3.  Necessity  for  complete,  accurate  and  reliable  information,  and verification of understanding through feedback from surveys and discussions with resident. 2.5.2.1.4.4.  Obligation  for  professionalism,  integrity,  courtesy,  cooperation,  and respect. 2.5.2.1.4.5.  Importance  of  appropriate  empathy  and  compassion  based  on customer needs. 2.5.2.1.4.6.  Urgency of promptly responding to and following up on all requests. 2.5.2.1.4.7.  Significance  of  documenting  housing  records  with  comprehensive customer service actions. 2.5.2.1.4.8.  Value of leaving customers with  a positive impression of the HMO, Privatized Housing PMO and the GOQ Management Team. 2.5.3.  Education and Training. 2.5.3.1.  The Commander ensures GOQ Team members receive sufficient AF-sponsored and  -funded  formal  training  to  be  proficient  in  all  aspects  of  GOQ  management. Refresher  training  is  recommended  every  2-3  years,  or  as  policy  and  processes significantly change.  2.5.3.2.  Installation leadership should enable Team members to take advantage of other opportunities that revitalize their customer service skills. (T-3) 2.6.  Daily Operations and Customer Support.  Under the leadership of the Housing Manager, the  GOQ  Management  Team  support  functions,  which  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  the following four interconnected phases: (T-1) 2.6.1.  Before  Arrival.  Contact  incoming  resident  or  designated  representative.  Send  a welcome package, including housing application, and comprehensive information about  the projected GOQ, installation, and the local community. If requested, arrange a pre-Permanent Change of Station (PCS) visit in the home with arriving and departing residents. 2.6.2.  Arrival.  Schedule  a  walkthrough  of  the  assigned  GOQ  to  conduct  the  initial inspection.  Provide  a  GOQ  Resident  Guide  to  GOQ  residents  upon  assignment.  Brief residents on Privatized Housing PMO, HMO and resident responsibilities, identify POCs and contact  information  for  maintenance,  furnishings,  and  other  housing  and  installation requirements. Explain appliance and equipment operation, as needed, and ensure furnishings requirements  are  in  place  or  on  order.  Provide  other  information  unique  to  the  installation and community. AFI32-6003  14 APRIL 2016 15 2.6.3.  Residency.  Meet  with  GOQ  residents  as needed to  ensure  a coordinated annual  and long-range  housing  plan,  service  requirements  are  being  met,  and  to  provide  information about  scheduled  or  unscheduled  work  and  services.  At  the  appropriate  time,  inquire  about pending  PCS  orders.  Contact  the  gaining  HMO  and  coordinate  assistance  with  housing application and information about the gaining installation and community. 2.6.4.  Departure.  Conduct  pre-termination  inspection  to  explain  cleaning  standards  and request  feedback  to  identify  scope  of  maintenance  and  repair  (M&R).  Follow  up  to  make sure  resident  has  information  about  the  gaining  HMO  and  installation.  Conduct  final inspections  to  ensure  cleaning  meets  standards  and  that  requirements  for  change  of occupancy  are  complete.  FMS  accompanies  inspector  on  final  inspection  to  inspect furnishings for damages, and to remove or replace furnishings, as needed. 2.7.  Measuring Customer Service: 2.7.1.  The HMO will establish a customer feedback tool to assess GOQ Management Team service and determine need  for process changes.  (T-2) The HMO is responsible to  develop the feedback tool with: 2.7.1.1.  Clearly defined objectives. 2.7.1.2.  Most important question asked first. 2.7.1.3.  Short, clear questions 2.7.1.4.  Stand-alone questions. 2.7.2.  As  a  minimum  ensure  the  survey  tool  includes  the  elements  in  Table  2.1,  Template for GOQ Management Team Survey. The HMO may expand or customize the survey to meet installation requirements and scope of GOQ service. Provide survey form to  customer with each service request. Table 2.1.

The Air Force maintains GOQs in a state of excellence commensurate with their purpose and historical significance and the need to protect the significant Air Force investment. Quality GOQs are critical to enabling senior Air Force leadership to perform their missions and provide adequate and appropriate settings for official entertainment. GOQs receive close scrutiny from  both  the  private  and  public  sector.  As  a  result,  GOQs  are  frequently  a  matter  of  special congressional interest. 3.1.1.  The key to maintaining GOQs is appropriately identifying facility work requirements, and participation by residents in this process is vital. The BCE must develop a plan for each GOQ  that  includes  day-to-day  requirements  while  considering  future  capital  investments necessary  to  sustain  the  quality  of  the  dwelling.  (T-1)  Specific  details  for  long-range requirements are in the GOQ IFP. For major maintenance, repair, and investment decisions, use the Air Force GOQ Master Plan and the Air Force Family Housing Master Plan (FHMP). The  BCE  is  required  to  ensure  all  work  is  consistent  with  Air  Force  GOQ  Standards  for Programming,  Design  and  Construction  (Paragraph   3.2.1.2)  as  supplemented  by MAJCOM - approved installation standards. (T-0) 3.1.2.  By statute, military family housing (MFH) funds are the exclusive source of funds for all  operations  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  government-owned/leased  units,  including  those temporarily diverted as unaccompanied housing. 3.1.3.  Unaccompanied members residing in government-owned/leased GOQs are authorized furnishings support IAW AFI 32-6004. 3.2.  Planning.  The BCE must ensure a long range plan is prepared for each government-owned GOQ,  using  the  GOQ  IFP  along  with  the  base  FHMP.  (T-0)  Comprehensive  planning  can prevent  un-programmed—often  costly—services  and  maintenance.  GOQ  long-range  plans should reflect the total scope of work and improvements to renovate the GOQ to standards. Do not  suppress  costs,  but  make  sure  budget  estimates  accurately  reflect  anticipated  expenditures. GOQ work may cost more than other FH units because of age, historic designation, design, size of typical units, and the complexity of the work. The BCE ensures all work is consistent with the GOQ Master Plan and IFP.  3.2.1.  General Officer Quarters Guide.  In addition to the GOQ Master Plan, the Air Force has developed a GOQ Guide. The GOQ Guide is contained in a boxed set of three volumes: 3.2.1.1.  Volume  I,  GOQ  Resident  Handbook.  The  handbook  provides  GOs,  their spouses,  and  executive  staffs  with  the  rules,  standards,  and  expectations  concerning GOQs. The handbook also incorporates guidelines and limitations associated with overall GOQ  program  management,  work  requirements,  furnishings  authorizations,  cost reporting, and standards.   AFI32-6003  14 APRIL 2016 17 3.2.1.2.  Volume II, GOQ Standards for Programming, Design, and Construction: 3.2.1.2.1.  Volume II, supplements housing facility standards in the Air Force Family Housing  Guide  for  Planning,  Programming,  Design  and  Construction,  and  is available  from  AFCEC  (http://www.wbdg.org/ccb/AF/AFDG/familyhousing.pdf).  Volume  II  also  provides  standardized  residential  criteria  for  all  GOQs,  balances quality  of  life  with  cost,  establishes  architectural  elements  and  building  features comparable  with  regional  and  local  housing  standards,  and  minimizes  recurring maintenance. 3.2.1.2.2.  Installations with GOQs may supplement Volume II with local installation standards  compatible  with  Air  Force  parameters,  considering  climatic  conditions, architectural styles, local construction practices, MAJCOM policies, applicable laws, and regulations.   3.2.1.3.  Volume  III,  GOQ  Individual  Facility  Profile  (IFP).  The  IFP  for  each government-owned  GOQ  includes  facility  data,  such  as  the  age  and  condition  of  the GOQ, improvements, major and minor M&R requirements, and cost  estimates for work accomplished  using  the  O&M  program  or  as  a  one-time,  more  cost-efficient,  whole-house improvement project. Each IFP identifies an interim O&M plan, and a long-range whole-house investment plan. 3.2.1.3.1.  IFP  cost  estimates  are  categorized  based  on  M&R  codes,  indicating  the relative urgency of repair. Codes 1-3 prioritize work items  by distinguishing  among repairs required immediately to  address  life-safety  issues, components that  fail prior to the whole-house project and those which should wait until the whole-house project is executed. 3.2.1.3.2.  Whole-house  estimates  combine  all  required  maintenance,  repairs,  and investments into one project to completely revitalize a GOQ to last another 25 years. Whole-house  projects  represent  the  most  cost-effective  housing  revitalization approach  for  the  Air  Force  to  meet  current  standards.    These  projects  are congressionally  approved  and  are  typically  accomplished  using  Military  Family Housing Post Acquisition (Improvement) funds (P-713). 3.2.2.  Air  Force  General  Officer  Quarters  (GOQ)  Master  Plan.  To  ensure  MAJCOMs and  bases  appropriately  plan,  program,  and  budget  for  GOQ  requirements,  the  Air  Force developed  a  GOQ  Master  Plan.  The  plan  captures  facility  data,  identifies  improvements, major and minor M&R requirements, and provides recommendations and cost estimates for each GOQ based on a whole- house perspective. The GOQ Master Plan contains an IFP for each GOQ. The IFP is updated and incorporated into the Housing Community Profile (HCP) every 4 years, as the HCP is updated. The HCP, including the IFP, identifies requirements for all  FH  and  is  incorporated  into  the  FHMP  for  funding  priority  and  allocation.  Schedule whole-house  projects  for  all  FH  IAW  overall  Air  Force  priorities  for  investment  funding based on condition as determined by the Air Force FHMP.    3.2.2.1.  GOQ Long-Range Plan. 3.2.2.1.1.  Using eMH’s  General  Flag  Officer Module (GFOM), HMO must  prepare an  annual  long-range  plan  to  budget  GOQ  costs,  including  operations,  M&R,  and improvement  work  requirements.  (T-0)  M&R  and  improvement  requirements  are 18 AFI32-6003  14 APRIL 2016 identified  in  the  IFP.  The  plan  covers  a  5-year  period  (the  current  year  plus  the following  4  years).  The  plan  provides  detailed  costs  of  management,  services, furnishings,  change  of  occupancy,  minor/routine  M&R,  major  M&R,  ground maintenance,  minor  alteration,  and  improvement costs  for  each  year.    The  plan  also identifies the need to request additional authority when the total OMR/M&R costs for a fiscal year (FY) exceeds $35,000 (Table 3.1).  3.2.2.1.2.  When  planning  a  whole-house  renovation  project,  limit  M&R  work  to correct a life, health, or safety issue, or to repair a failed component that cannot wait for a whole-house project. 3.2.2.2.  Spend Plan. the  HMO, in  collaboration  with 3.2.2.2.1.  Using  eMH’s  GFOM, the  GO Management  Team  and  the  BCE,  must  prepare  a  spend  plan  that  identifies programmed and recurring work and services required during the coming FY.  (T-0) Inputs  should  include  requirements  provided  by  residents,  current  inspections,  HCP and approved project work (O&M or improvement) from the GOQ IFP. Use priorities identified in  the  IFP to  determine O&M work  requirements. Adjust the  plan as new requirements  develop,  and  include  change  of  occupancy  maintenance  (COM)  work when a change of resident is anticipated.  Use the spend plan for each unit to schedule work throughout the year and closely monitor cost limits. (Table 3.1)  3.2.2.2.2.  BCE  must  document  justification  for  accomplishing  work  requirements that  cannot  wait  for  a  whole-house  project.    If  there  are  compelling  or  unforeseen reasons  that  cause  GOQ  IFP  component  rated  good  or  excellent  to  fail  or  be  in  a worsened  condition,  BCEs  must  document  the  circumstances  with  a  life-cycle analysis  and  photos  or  other  evidence  supporting  early  replacement  or  repair decisions. (T-1) The intent is not to preclude M&R of GOQs but to make sure fully functional components or systems are not replaced until they are near the end of their economic  life,  or  it  makes  good  economic  sense  when  included  as  part  of  a  larger revitalization project.  3.3.  Programming.  The  Installation  Civil  Engineering  uses  the  installation  FHMP  and  GOQ IFPs to  identify requirements for FH investment  or major M&R projects.  Follow programming instructions  in  AFI  32-6002.  Consider  all  statutory  limits  and  Air  Force  GOQ  policies,  and  do not exceed these limits under any circumstances without prior congressional approval through the  budget  submission  process  or  an  out-of-cycle  exceed-threshold  request.  Bases  may  not perform  major  M&R,  minor  alteration,  replacement,  improvement,  or  minor  improvement  to  a new (P-711) or improved (P-713; whole-house) unit within 3 years after the first resident moves in (beneficial occupancy) following project completion without prior approval (exception noted in Paragraph  3.3.1.7). The BCE must ensure the following:  (T-0)  3.3.1.  Improvements (P-713).  Program improvement (investment) projects to whole-house and  whole-neighborhood  criteria  as  defined  in  AFI  32-6002  and  GOQ  standards.  The programmed  scope  in  DD  Form  1391,  Military  Construction  Project  Data,  complies  with approved  scope  and  functional  changes  in  the  GOQ  IFP.  Major  improvement  projects  are accomplished with improvement funds (P-713) and should revitalize the unit to last another 25 years. This is the Air Force preferred method to upgrade the housing inventory.   AFI32-6003  14 APRIL 2016 19 3.3.1.1.  Congress  sets  the  statutory  unit  cost  limit  for  housing  improvements  and concurrent  major  M&R  and  minor  alteration  work.  The  current  statutory  limit  for improvement  projects  is  $50,000  times  the  area  cost  factor  (ACF)  or  $60,000  times  the ACF to make the unit habitable by a handicapped person. ACF is not applied in foreign locations. SAF/IEE may waive the limits  if it is  determined that,  considering the useful life of the unit to be improved and the useful life of a newly constructed unit and the cost of construction and of operation and maintenance of each kind of unit over its useful life, the  improvement  will  be  cost-effective.  The  limit  excludes  costs  for  installation  and maintenance  or  repair  of  communications,  security,  and  antiterrorism/force  protection (AT/FP) equipment required by the resident in the performance of assigned duties. If the cost of a proposed improvement project is expected to exceed the statutory limit, the Air Force  must  include  the  project  in  the  annual  President’s  Budget  for  congressional approval.  3.3.1.2.  The project may be executed at the higher cost only if prior authority is obtained in  the  military  construction  authorization  bill.  The  new  limit  resulting  from  this  bill becomes  the  new  statutory  limit  for  the  specific  GOQ  for  the  specific  FY  of  project execution. 3.3.1.3.  DD  Form  1391  provides  additional  justification  needed  for  congressional approval of all projects exceeding $50,000. Ensure this data provides strong justification and is consistent with the GOQ IFP. The MAJCOM/CE validates the work is consistent with the GOQ IFP by signing the DD Form 1391. The BCE provides information to the base Financial Services Office, for preparation of the Economic Analysis (EA) (AFI 65-501, Economic Analysis). 3.3.1.4.  An  EA  is  mandatory  for  all  projects.  If  the  EA  determines  the  estimated improvement costs exceed 70 percent of the replacement cost, a replacement construction project is programmed unless the GOQ is eligible for or listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  Note:    The  Commander  may  request  removal  of  historic  properties  from  the  National  Register following procedures in 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 60.15(a)(1)-(4). 3.3.1.5.  The most expensive unit (costs include contingency and supervision, inspection and  overhead)  in  an  improvement  project  becomes  the  high-cost  unit.  When  there  is  a requirement  to  exceed  the  most  expensive  unit  cost  for  a  GOQ,  AF/A4C  approval  is required.    SAF/IEE  approval  is  required  to  exceed  the  cost  by  more  than  25  percent. MAJCOM/CE signs and submits the request to exceed the limit to AF/A4C. 3.3.1.6.  The  DD  Form  1391  for  a  GOQ  improvement  project  (P-713)  also  includes projected  major  M&R  and  minor  alteration  requirements.  In  the  FY  the  improvement project’s funds are obligated, the major M&R and minor alteration work is limited only to  what  is  identified  in  the  DD  Form  1391.The  only  additional  O&M  funded  (P-722) work  authorized  in  the  year  funds  are  obligated  is  minor  M&R  and  COM.    In  the following  years,  the  $35,000  limit  applies  to  all  OMR/M&R  costs.  Only  minor maintenance  and  COM  work  is  allowed  for  3  years  following  occupancy  except  for extremely urgent and compelling repairs, typically relating to health or life-safety.  20 AFI32-6003  14 APRIL 2016 3.3.1.7.  Do  not  undertake  a  replacement,  improvement,  minor  improvement,  major M&R, or minor alteration project on a new unit or on a unit that has been improved for 3 years  following  beneficial  occupancy.  The  3-year  limit  does  not  apply  when  a  project addresses  health,  safety,  or  life-  threatening  conditions,  if  the  project  falls  under  the auspices of a larger program, such as a general energy efficiency upgrade program, or if work must be accomplished to prevent further damage to the dwelling following a natural disaster  or  other  emergency.  In  all  cases,  MAJCOMs  must  request  approval  from AF/A4CF prior to accomplishing the work by submitting a copy of DD Form 1391 with full  justification  for  not  meeting  the  3-year  limit.  See  Paragraph    3.3.4  for  self-help project approval.  3.3.2.  Operations  and Maintenance  (O&M)  (P-72X).  There are two statutory limitations (10  U.S.C.  §  2831  and  annually  recurring  provisions  in  the  Military  Construction Appropriation Acts) that limit the annual expenditure of certain types of FH O&M funds on a GOQ. These limits are discussed in Table 3.1  Table 3.1.  Maintenance and Repair (M&R) and Operations, Maintenance and Repair (OMR) Annual Statutory Expenditure Limits for Government-Owned/Leased GOQs. MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR (M&R) THRESHOLD Military  Construction  Appropriation  Acts  annually  place  a  ceiling  of  $35,000  on  all  M&R expenditures per GOQ per FY. GOQ  expenditures  that  count  against  the  M&R  annual  limit  include  change  of  occupancy, minor/routine M&R, major M&R, grounds maintenance and minor alteration. Recurring  provision  in  the  appropriations  act  allows  for  after-the-fact  notification  based  on unforeseen environmental remediation. OPERATIONS, MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR (OMR) THRESHOLD 10 U.S.C. § 2831 placed a ceiling of $35,000 on all OMR expenditures per GOQ per FY. GOQ  expenditures  counted  against  the  OMR  annual  limit  include  management  (721.1),  services (721.2), furnishings (721.4) and M&R (722). M&R  expenditures  include  change  of  occupancy,  minor/routine  M&R,  major  M&R,  grounds maintenance, and minor alterations. 10  U.S.C.  §  2831  allows  for  after-the-fact  notification  based  on  unforeseen  environmental remediation, or safety and security as defined below. 10  U.S.C.  §  2831  also  allows  restoration  costs  for  a  GOQ  historical  features  to  be  exempted  from counting  against  the  annual  OMR  limit.    However,  these  costs  may  not  be  waived  from  counting against the annual M&R limit. 3.3.2.1.  Funding  is  based  on  the  validated  requirements  contained  in  the  installation FHMP  and  GOQ  IFPs.  The  Air  Force  does  not  budget  for,  nor  expect  each  resident  to spend  $35,000  per  year.  Address  significant  needs  in  all  categories  of  FH,  including GOQs, keeping in mind limited housing O&M budgets. 3.3.2.2.  Do  not  exceed  the  M&R  or  OMR  thresholds  without  prior  notification  to Congress or approval to notify Congress after-the-fact. An after-the-fact notification may only  be  accomplished  when  the  requirement  arose  after  the  President’s  Budget  was submitted.  Approval  to  notify  the  Congress  after-the-fact  must  be  based  on  unforeseen AFI32-6003  14 APRIL 2016 21 environmental  remediation  (M&R  or  OMR  threshold)  or  resident  safety  and  security (OMR threshold only), as defined below.   3.3.2.2.1.  Exception  for  Environmental  Remediation.  The  Military  Construction Appropriation Acts and 10 U.S.C. § 2831 allow after-the-fact notification to Congress if  the  GOQ  annual  M&R  or  OMR  threshold  ($35,000  or  as-notified)  is  exceeded solely  due  to  the  cost  of  unforeseen  environmental  remediation  costs  resulting  from an  on-going  M&R  action.    Limit  work  executed  under  this  exemption  to  that  work required to ensure resident safety and health from environmental conditions.    3.3.2.2.1.1.  The  MAJCOM/CE  is  the  approval  authority  to  exceed  the  annual M&R or OMR limit ($35,000 or as notified). 3.3.2.2.1.2.  MAJCOMs  notify  AF/A4CF  within  15  days  of  approval  to  exceed the  annual  M&R  or  OMR  limit  due  to  unforeseen  environmental  hazard remediation. The notification package includes a copy of the approval memo plus a  DD  Form  1391  (with  backup  detailed  cost  estimates)  documenting  revised project  costs  including  the  planned  remediation  plan,  start  date  of  the  original M&R  project  (prior  to  discovery  of  the  remediation  work),  and  a  summary  of current  and  projected  end-of-the-year  OMR  costs  for  the  GOQ.  If  approved, MAJCOM/CE provides a copy of the approval memo to the installation. 3.3.2.2.1.3.  File  a  copy  of  the  after-the-fact  notification  approval  memo  in  the GOQ project folder and the GOQ cost report files. 3.3.2.2.1.4.  Submit  a  copy  of  the  after-the-fact  notification  approval  memo  to AF/A4CF with the annual cost report for the GOQ. 3.3.2.2.1.5.  SAF/IEE notifies Congress after the fact, as required. 3.3.2.2.2.  Exception for Safety and Security.  Provided the GOQ M&R threshold is not also exceeded, 10 U.S.C. § 2831 allows after-the-fact notification to Congress if the annual GOQ OMR  limit ($35,000 or  as notified) is  exceeded to  protect  resident safety  and  security  or  because  of  a  combination  of  environmental  remediation  and safety and security costs. Since the recurring Military Construction Appropriation Act does not  allow for this exception, this authority  may not  be used to  notify Congress after-the-fact of exceeding the M&R limit ($35,000 or as notified). This exception is provided  to  allow  the  Services  to  respond  in  a  timely  manner  to  correct  imminent, documented threats to GOQ resident safety or security. Appropriate documentation of the  requirement  and  its  urgency  should  include  Antiterrorism/Force  Protection (AT/FP)  or  threat  assessments,  Joint  Service  Integrated  Vulnerability  Assessment (JSIVA) reports, Risk Assessment Codes (RAC), and/or safety evaluation reports.  3.3.2.2.2.1.  The  MAJCOM/CE  is  the  approval  authority  to  exceed  the  $35,000 OMR  limit  due  to  resident  safety  and  security  issues.  Notice  that  this  authority cannot be used to exceed the $35K M&R limit. Obtain approval prior to starting any work that causes the GOQ annual OMR costs to exceed the annual limit. The MAJCOM provides a copy of the approval memo to the installation.   3.3.2.2.2.2.  The  MAJCOM  notifies  AF/A4C  within  15  days  of  MAJCOM/CE approval  to  exceed  the  $35,000  OMR  limit  for  resident  safety  or  security.  A 22 AFI32-6003  14 APRIL 2016 complete  notification  package  includes  a  copy  of  the  exception  approval  memo, detailed  documentation  of  the  safety  or  security  issue  (e.g.  safety  reports,  threat evaluations,  JSIVA  report),  a  DD  Form  1391  (with  backup  detailed  cost estimates),  and  a  summary  of  current  and  projected  end-of-the-year  OMR  costs for the GOQ. 3.3.2.2.2.3.  File  a  copy  of  the  after-the-fact  notification  approval  memo  in  the GOQ project folder and the OMR cost files.   3.3.2.2.2.4.  Submit  a copy of the after-the-fact  notification approval  memo  with the annual GOQ cost report. 3.3.2.2.2.5.  SAF/IEE notifies Congress after the fact as required. 3.3.2.3.  GOQ  5-Foot  Rule.  M&R  (P-722)  costs  to  service  GOQs  for  utility  systems such  as  water,  electricity,  gas,  wastewater,  communications  and  alarm  systems,  and associated  M&R  may  extend  only  to  the  5-foot  line  of  the  GOQ  footprint.  This  charge does  not  apply  to  the  alarm  system  itself,  but  only  to  the  communications  connections going to the central system. 3.3.2.4.  Communications,  Security  and  AT/FP  Requirements/Funding.  M&R  costs for  security,  AT/FP  and  communications  (excluding  removable  communication equipment) required by the GOQ resident to  perform his  or her mission, are charged to the annual $35,000 limit, except when funded by authorized improvement project (P-713 funds). 3.3.2.4.1.  MFH  funds  pay  for  permanently  installed  communications  requirements, such as fiber optic cables. Communications equipment that is readily removable and mission-  required  is  funded  with  non-MFH  funds.  See  Attachment  1  for  the definition of readily removable communications equipment. 3.3.2.4.2.  MFH  funds  pay  for  permanently  installed  security  and  AT/FP  system components  such  as  wiring/fiber  optics.  Readily  removable  security  and  AT/FP equipment is funded with non-MFH funds. 3.3.3.  Minor Alterations (P-722). 3.3.3.1.  Minor alteration is construction or improvement (new) work typically performed in  support  of  an  M&R  project  and  funded  with  MFH  M&R  funds  (P-722).  However, some circumstances may warrant use of minor alteration without repair. Minor alteration work  installs  or  constructs  systems,  or  features  that  do  not  currently  exist  or  changes systems,  features or spaces that already  exist. This authority should be used for interior and  exterior  work  consistent  with  the  Air  Force  GOQ  IFP  and  GOQ  standards.  Do  not use this authority to increase the size of any unit or increase the number of rooms in any unit.  3.3.3.2.  Replacement  of  functioning  or  serviceable  material,  system,  or  component systems prior to the end of their useful life is classified as minor alteration. Replacement of failed or unserviceable materials, systems, or components with contemporary standard components or materials, consistent with local GOQ standards, is not minor alteration if justified by a life-cycle analysis. Replacement of failed or unserviceable material, system, or  component,  with  an  upgraded  material,  component  or  system  that  exceeds AFI32-6003  14 APRIL 2016 23 contemporary standards or local GOQ standards is always classified as minor alteration. Examples include, but are not limited to: 3.3.3.2.1.  Installing new planting areas or borders (not currently installed). 3.3.3.2.2.  Replacing  carpet  with  wood  flooring  or  tile  (even  if  the  carpet  is  due  for replacement). 3.3.3.2.3.  Replacing laminate countertop with an upgraded surface. 3.3.3.2.4.  Installing new outlets and/or lighting (not currently installed). 3.3.3.2.5.  Replacing window air conditioning unit with ducted system. 3.3.3.2.6.  Installing gravel/rocks in place of grass. 3.3.3.2.7.  Installing water-softener to the plumbing system. 3.3.3.3.  MAJCOMs may delegate authority for minor alterations costing up to $3,000 per GOQ unit per year to the BCE. Minor alteration work exceeding $3,000 and up to but not exceeding  $7,500  annually  require  approval  by  the  MAJCOM/CV.  Cumulative  annual costs exceeding $7,500 require approval by SAF/IEE. Do not use this authority to: 3.3.3.3.1.  Increase the size (living area or net square footage) of the unit. 3.3.3.3.2.  Increase the number of rooms in the unit. 3.3.3.3.3.  Perform  improvement  or  alteration  to  uninhabitable  space  in  attics  or basements. 3.3.3.4.  No  GO  may  approve  a  waiver  to  the  minor  alteration  limit  for  work  on  their GOQ,  nor  for  the  GOQ  of  an  officer  senior  in  rank.  For  MAJCOM  CCs,  the  USAFA Superintendent, single- installation MAJCOMs or other O-10s, the approval authority is AF/CV. Forward requests through the MAJCOM to AF/A4CF for processing to AF/CV for approval.  3.3.3.5.  Charge  costs  for  GOQ  minor  alterations  work  to  the  annual  GOQ  M&R  and OMR limits. 3.3.3.6.  Installation  of  AT/FP  requirements  is  excluded  from  minor  alteration  limits. Identify requirements subject to this exclusion through a JSIVA or MAJCOM, Service, or installation  vulnerability  assessment.  The  work  requires  Commander  approval  before beginning installation.  Keep documentation of the assessment and approval on file with the  project  approval  documentation.  Although  the  AT/FP  requirement  is  not  charged against the minor alteration limit, the HMO must include this cost on the AF Form 3826 cost report as minor alteration and as a result, charged against the annual M&R and OMR limits. (T-1) 3.3.4.  Self-Help  Work.  The  Air  Force  strongly  supports  self-help  projects  that  are consistent  with  codes,  standards,  safety,  and  functionality.  Residents  request  BCE  approval before beginning self- help projects. If the BCE approves a project with the condition that the GOQ is returned to the original configuration, the resident is responsible to restore the GOQ to its original condition before clearing the GOQ. Charge government-provided materials for self-help work against the $35,000 OMR and M&R limits. 24 AFI32-6003  14 APRIL 2016 3.3.4.1.  For self-help projects, AF/A4CF considers waivers to the 3-year rule explained in  Paragraph  3.3.1.7,  if  the  waiver  does  not  exceed  $2,500  and  meets  the  following criteria: 3.3.4.1.1.  Simple,  minor  projects  (e.g.,  installing  ceiling  fans,  fences,  and  flower beds). 3.3.4.1.2.  Does not involve large complicated projects, such as renovating kitchens or bathrooms. 3.3.4.1.3.  Does  not  violate  approval  levels,  Air  Force  size  standards,  improvement cost limits, or GOQ limits. 3.3.5.  Exceeding OMR and M&R Limits. 3.3.5.1.  In-Budget Cycle.  GOQ limits may be exceeded only after appropriate approval and, if needed, notification to Congress. Typically, notification is accomplished through submission  of  the  Air  Force  budget.  MAJCOMs  accomplish  this  in  their  response  to AF/A4CF call letter issued as part of the Budget Estimate Submission (BES) preparation. 3.3.5.1.1.  Submit DD Form 1391 validated by the MAJCOM/CE, as justification for all GOQ exceed-threshold projects. 3.3.5.1.2.  Ensure projects are consistent with the GOQ IFP. 3.3.5.1.3.  When requesting an exceed-threshold, the MAJCOM must ensure the total amount  requested  is  equal  to  the  sum  of  annual  projected  costs  for  management, services,  furnishings,  and  M&R  (major  and  minor  M&R,  minor  alteration,  grounds maintenance,  and  COM).  When  approved  by  Congress,  the  total  becomes  the  OMR limit  for  the  GOQ  for  that  Budget  Year  (BY)  and  the  M&R  request  becomes  the M&R limit for that BY. 3.3.5.1.4.  Make  every  effort  to  award  major  M&R  projects  (P-722)  in  the  exceed threshold  request  in  the  BY.  MAJCOMs  are  responsible  to  work  with  the  base  to ensure timely awards.  Only as a last resort may these projects be executed in the year following the BY under the limits reported to Congress.  Only use current year (year of award) funds to award the projects. 3.3.5.1.4.1.  MAJCOM/CEs must notify AF/A4C prior to 1 September of the BY of GOQ exceed threshold projects not awarded in the BY. 3.3.5.1.4.2.  If an exceed threshold GOQ project is deferred to the year following the  BY  (BY+1),  the  M&R  and  OMR  limit  for  the  BY  are  reduced  to  the  GOQ statutory  OMR  limit  ($35,000).    The  M&R  and  OMR  limit  for  the  BY+1  is  the approved exceed threshold amount (includes the cost of the project work and all M&R). 3.3.5.1.4.3.  Retain  a  memo  for  record  in  the  project  file  to  document  the carryover of the budget authority.  Annotate AF Form 3826 to reflect carryover of this authority.   AFI32-6003  14 APRIL 2016 25 3.3.5.2.  Out-of-Budget Cycle. 3.3.5.2.1.  An  out-of-cycle  budget  submission  may  be  made  only  when  there  is  an extremely  urgent  situation,  typically  relating  to  risks  to  health,  life  or  safety. Installation  Commander  must  submit  out-of-cycle  requests  for  proposed  work  so urgent and compelling it cannot wait for the next annual budget submission; it could not reasonably have been foreseen at the time of budget submission; cost of the work causes the GOQ to exceed the $35,000 OMR limit and possibly the M&R limit; and work does not constitute an alteration, addition, or improvement. (T-0) 3.3.5.2.2.  Out-of-cycle requests to exceed the $35,000 limit (or other limits) receive scrutiny  by  numerous  Air  Staff  and  Air  Force  Secretariat  officials.  After-the-fact notifications  are  not  allowed  except  as  described  in  Paragraph  3.3.2.2.    SAF/IEE reviews  and  approves  all  out-of-cycle  notifications.  Approved  requests  are  then submitted  to  Congress  for  notification.    Congress  has  30  days  to  act  on  the notification  to  exceed  the  M&R  limit.  Time  periods  for  notification  to  exceed  the OMR limit, only, may be shorter. Submissions should include: 3.3.5.2.2.1.  Strong  justification  for  why  work  needs  to  be  done  out  of  cycle, including  reasons  the  requirement  was  not  included  in  the  budget  submission, urgency, and impact of the delay. 3.3.5.2.2.2.  Comprehensive narrative for each GOQ project, including validation the  work  is  identified in  the  GOQ  IFP.    If  the  work  is  not  included  in  the  GOQ IFP, provide a detailed explanation for the work. 3.3.5.2.2.3.  A  completed  DD  Form  1391  to  show  specific  project  work  to  be accomplished on the unit and to identify costs additional to the threshold. 3.3.5.2.2.4.  Detailed cost breakout (including line item details). 3.3.5.2.2.5.  Photographs depicting repair requirements. 3.3.5.2.2.6.  A statement signed by the GOQ resident acknowledging the work. 3.3.5.2.2.7.  A project certification statement signed by the MAJCOM/CE. 3.3.5.2.2.8.  Detailed breakout of other anticipated costs for the FY, including, but not limited to, specific projects approved by SAF/IEE and all OMR costs. 3.3.5.2.2.9.  Detailed  breakout  of  major  M&R  or  investment  work  completed  in the previous 5 years or planned for the next 5 years IAW the GOQ IFP. 3.3.6.  Daily  Operations.  HMOs  manage  and  provide  on-going  support  for  GOQs.  The following guidance applies: 3.3.6.1.  Change of Occupancy Maintenance (COM).  COM is M&R work on housing units  when  occupancy  changes,  including  interior  painting;  repairing  floors,  walls,  and ceiling finishes; repairing electrical and plumbing fixtures; and cleaning over and above resident responsibilities. The intent of Air Force policy is to make sure necessary COM tasks are accomplished, depending on the local conditions and installation requirements.   26 AFI32-6003  14 APRIL 2016 3.3.6.1.1.  COM  may  include,  but  is  not  limited  to,  the  following  tasks  and  is performed as required: 3.3.6.1.1.1.  Restore  interior  walls.  Depending  on  condition,  patch  and  repaint walls  and  ceilings  as  required,  typically  every  3  years.  Paint  walls  and  ceilings, using  a  neutral  color.  BCE  ensures  paint  meets  Air  Force  and  base  GOQ standards. Neutral color is defined in Attachment 1, Terms. 3.3.6.1.1.2.  Clean carpets, window coverings, and light fixtures.  3.3.6.1.1.3.  Service heating, ventilation,  and  air  conditioning systems; and clean air ducts. 3.3.6.1.1.4.  Perform  minor  M&R  work  throughout,  including  electrical  and plumbing fixtures. 3.3.6.1.1.5.  Restore and paint exterior surfaces. 3.3.6.1.1.6.  Inspect and repair structure and infrastructure (roof, attic, crawlspace, and pavement). 3.3.6.1.1.7.  Service and repair doors and windows. 3.3.6.1.1.8.  Apply/renew barrier pesticide treatment. 3.3.6.1.1.9.  Perform  grounds  maintenance  (mow,  edge,  and  trim  trees  and bushes). 3.3.6.1.1.10.  Repair or replace caulking and weather seals (interior and exterior). 3.3.6.1.2.  Charge  all  minor  M&R  and  cleaning  done  during  the  COM  to  722.62  on AF Form 3826, Section I-3, Line 1 (Paragraph  A4.3.1.1). Minor M&R includes, but is not limited to, minor repairs to floor, wall, and ceiling finishes, and electrical and plumbing fixtures with a cost of $2,500 or less per task.  Charge interior painting and floor  repair  (or  replacement),  to  major  repair  when  the  cost  per  task  (single  item  of work) exceeds $2,500. Do not split M&R requirements to keep costs under $2,500. 3.3.6.1.3.  If  time  permits  and  conditions  warrant,  other  M&R  work  may  be performed during the COM that is consistent with requirements identified in the GOQ IFP  and  IAW  Air  Force  and  local  GOQ  standards.  Note:  IAW  AFI  32-6002,  some work  may  not  be  authorized  if  determined  to  be  major  M&R,  minor  alteration,  or improvement  type  work  for  a  new  or  improved  unit  within  3  years  of  initial occupancy (Paragraph  3.3.1.7). 3.3.6.2.  Maintaining  Grounds.  GOQ  residents  are  responsible  for  maintaining  the grounds within the exclusive use area of their homes. The exclusive use area includes the grounds  around the facility considered to  be reserved for the use of the  residents  of the GOQ (or authorized guest) only. Normally, this includes an area 50 feet  from the home (calculated  from  the  further  most  elevation  on  all  four  sides  of  the  homes);  however,  it may be larger as a result of natural or constructed barriers which limit free access to the area  by  members  of  the  installation  housing  community  or  as  designated  by  the Installation  Commander.  Grounds  maintenance  includes  routine  lawn/landscaping maintenance,  such  as  mowing,  edging,  raking,  planting  annuals,  tree  trimming, AFI32-6003  14 APRIL 2016 27 maintaining  shrubbery,  herbicide  treatments,  fertilizing,  pruning,  mulching,  including self-help store materials. 3.3.6.2.1.  SCP  GOQ  residents  are  authorized  government-provided  grounds maintenance  for  the  entire  GOQ  exclusive  use  area.    Charge  costs  for  the government-provided  grounds  maintenance  to  the  GOQ  OMR/M&R  threshold  and report on the AF Form 3826. 3.3.6.2.2.  Non-SCP  GOQ  residents  are  personally  responsible  for  grounds maintenance of the entire exclusive use area; however, in situations described below, government-provided  grounds  maintenance  is  allowed  only  after  a  MAJCOM/CC waiver  is  approved.    Waiver  approval  authority  may  not  be  further  delegated.  In  no case  may  the  individual  exercising  this  authority  make  a  decision  about  their  own GOQ  or  a  GOQ  of  a  person  senior  in  rank.  When  government-provided  grounds maintenance is approved, all associated costs are charged to that GOQ annual OMR and M&R limits. When enlisted aides perform grounds maintenance, their work is not charged to the OMR limit. MAJCOM/CCs may approve waivers to: 3.3.6.2.2.1.  Allow  government-provided  grounds  maintenance  of  the  entire exclusive  use  area  if  the  GOQ  is  prominently  located  and  makes  a  unique contribution  to  the  appearance  of  the  installation.    Charge  costs  for  the government-provided  grounds  maintenance  to  the  GOQ  OMR/M&R  threshold and report on the AF Form 3826. 3.3.6.2.2.2.  Allow government-provided grounds maintenance on that portion of the exclusive use  area beyond 50 feet if the exclusive use area is extremely large (one-half  acre  or  more).  Charge  costs  for  government-provided  grounds maintenance to the GOQ OMR/M&R threshold, and report on AF Form 3826. 3.3.6.2.2.3.  Areas with unique landscaping, extra-large trees or shrubbery or trees requiring  professional  service  or  specialized  equipment.  Charge  costs  for government-provided  grounds  maintenance  to  the  GOQ  OMR/M&R  threshold, and report on AF Form 3826. 3.3.6.2.2.4.  AF/A4 may authorize government-provided grounds maintenance for the  entire  exclusive  use  area  of  a  GOQ  occupied  by  a  senior  civilian  as  a condition  of  his  or  her  employment  and  assignment  to  a  position  which,  if occupied  by  a  military  officer,  could  be  maintained  by  enlisted  aides  to  that officer. Charge costs to the annual $35,000 limit. 3.3.6.2.3.  When  the  government  provides  grounds  maintenance  to  areas  shared  by more than one GOQ, costs are prorated and charged to each benefiting GOQ; OMR and M&R limits apply. 3.3.6.3.  Carpet.  Installed carpet, including pad, is considered an alternative floor finish and  therefore  an  integral  part  of  the  GOQ.  Carpet  should  be  professionally  cleaned  as needed IAW the Air Force Corporate Facilities Standards (http://wbdg.org/index.html), the  most  current  Engineering  Technical  Letter  (ETL),  and  manufacturer  instructions  to preserve carpet (http://www.wbdg.org/ccb/browse_cat.php?o=33&c=125) quality and the life of the 28 AFI32-6003  14 APRIL 2016 3.3.6.3.1.  Charge  installation  and  cleaning  of  installed  carpet  against  the  annual limits. 3.3.6.3.2.  Carpet  may  be  installed  in  all  living  areas  except  the  kitchen,  bathroom, powder  room,  patio,  porch,  and  other  areas  exposed  to  weather.  When  possible,  do not  install  carpet  at  entrances  and  heavy  traffic  areas  of  the  GOQ.  To  minimize damage to flooring and subflooring, do not use glue-down installation. 3.3.6.3.3.  The  BCE  maintains  the  following  historical  information  for  each  carpet installation: 3.3.6.3.3.1.  Location (address, building number, and room). 3.3.6.3.3.2.  Name of carpet manufacturer, pattern, and color. 3.3.6.3.3.3.  Manufacturer certification the carpet conforms to the most recent Air Force carpet standards available from the Air Force Corporate Facilities Standards and AFCEC. 3.3.6.3.3.4.  Date of installation. 3.3.6.3.3.5.  Method of installation and type of pad used. 3.3.6.3.3.6.  Disposal certification. 3.3.6.3.4.  For all GOQ carpet replacement, the Commander must certify the carpet is no longer serviceable and requires replacement. (T-1) 3.3.6.3.5.  Purchase quality carpet with a minimum 7-year life expectancy that meets Air  Force  standards  in  the  Air  Force  Family  Housing  Guide  for  Planning, Programming, Construction (http://www.wbdg.org/ccb/AF/AFDG/familyhousing.pdf) 07-04 (Paragraph    3.3.6.3.3.3).  Prior  to  purchase,  the  BCE  must  certify  the  carpet  meets Air Force carpet standards. (T-1) Design, and and ETL 3.3.6.3.6.  Purchase neutral color carpet, such as beige, taupe, or off-white in a light to medium shade that provides a flexible background that can integrate with the decor of  successive  residents.  Do  not  use  pure  whites  or  dark  shades.  Use  solid  colors  or muted tone-on-tone tweeds. 3.3.6.3.7.  Do  not  replace  carpet  in  less  than  7  years.  Only  MAJCOM/CCs  may approve  exceptions  to  the  7-year  minimum  life  carpet  replacement  policy.  This authority may not be further delegated. In no case may the individual exercising this authority make a decision about carpet in his or her own unit or the unit of a person senior in rank. 3.3.6.3.8.  Installation must submit waiver requests which include (T-1): 3.3.6.3.8.1.  A statement signed by the Commander validating the requirement for replacement carpet. 3.3.6.3.8.2.  Statement  signed  by  the  BCE  validating  replacement  carpet  meets Air Force standards.   AFI32-6003  14 APRIL 2016 29 3.3.6.3.8.3.  Month  and  year  the  carpet  requiring  replacement  was  originally installed.  State  if  the  carpet  is  still  under  manufacturer  warranty  and  include available warranty information. 3.3.6.3.8.4.  Clearly labeled photographs documenting the requirement. 3.3.6.4.  Window Coverings.  See Attachment 1 for the definition of window coverings. Window coverings (not to be confused with window treatments in Paragraph  5.3.1) and associated  hardware  are  an  integral  part  of  the  dwelling  and  should  be  provided  on  all windows  throughout  the  GOQ,  and  on  porch  and  patio  windows.  Window  coverings, unlike window treatments, are not considered furnishings but instead are considered part of the facility. 3.3.6.4.1.  Window coverings include shades, shutters, blinds (vertical and horizontal wood, aluminum, and vinyl), and  associated hardware. The BCE ensures  blind slats meet AF standards and are made of hard material, such as aluminum, vinyl, or wood, and a neutral color. 3.3.6.4.2.  Charge  window  coverings  and  associated  hardware  against  the  annual limits. 3.3.6.5.  Appliances  and  Equipment.  Freestanding or permanently installed appliances are provided to GOQs IAW Attachment 3, Table A3.1, part C. To determine the proper cost category, use the principle that installed is an M&R cost (P-722), and freestanding is  an  operations  cost  (P-721).  Charge  subsequent  costs  incurred  for  the  item (maintenance,  repair  or  replacement)  to  the  same  cost  category  initially  assigned  to  the appliance. 3.3.6.5.1.  Authorized appliances and equipment for GOQs include range or cook top with wall oven, two refrigerators or a refrigerator and freezer (Attachment 3,  Table A3.1,  Note  4),  installed  or  portable  dishwasher,  trash  compactors  and  icemaker. Washers and dryers are  provided in  all GOQs in  overseas areas and  for  SCP homes only in the continental United States (CONUS). 3.3.6.5.2.  Costs  to  buy,  install,  maintain  and  repair  built-in  appliances,  such  as dishwasher, built-in oven or cook top, are charged to the appropriate M&R category, Section I-3, AF Form 3826. 3.3.6.5.3.  Cost  to  buy,  install,  maintain,  and  repair  freestanding  appliances  (not installed) such as a portable dishwasher, refrigerator, range, microwave,  and washer and dryer are charged as furnishings not against the limit (AF Form 3826, Section I-1, Line 3B). 3.3.6.6.  Wall  Coverings.  Wall  coverings  are  authorized  in  specific  areas  of  GOQs. Select  wall  coverings  and  decorative  borders  in  neutral  colors  and  of  a  quality  and durability  to  last  through  successive  residents.  Do  not  use  pure  white  or  dark  colors. Charge authorized wall coverings and decorative borders against the annual limits.  3.3.6.6.1.  Neutral-color wall coverings and decorative borders are authorized for use in the kitchen, powder room and bathrooms. Neutral-color wall coverings may also be installed  below  any  chair  railing  in  the  designated  entertainment  areas,  such  as  the living room, dining room, family room, den, study and foyer. Wall coverings may not 30 AFI32-6003  14 APRIL 2016 be used on ceilings or paneling. Neutral colors are beige, taupe, or off-white in a light to medium shade that provides a flexible background that can integrate with the decor of successive residents. Do not use pure white or dark shades.  3.3.6.6.2.  GOQ  residents  may  install  borders  and  accents  over  painted  surfaces  at their own expense, but are responsible for removing items and restoring walls to the original condition prior to vacating the GOQ. 3.3.6.6.3.  Because  wallpaper  can  be  a  costly  item,  installations  are  encouraged  to obtain the services of a certified interior design professional to assist in determining best  value,  quality,  and  neutral  colors.  If  an  interior  design  service  is  not  available locally, contact the MAJCOM/CE or AFCEC Design Group for assistance. 3.3.6.7.  Irrigation Systems.  All lawn irrigation systems proposed for GOQs, regardless of method of accomplishment, require approval by SAF/IEE (AFI 32-6001). 3.3.6.8.  Flags.  For  government-owned/leased  GOQs,  United  States  (US),  combatant command, Service, and host nation flags, and appropriate apparatus (pole, stanchion) for flying,  may  be  purchased  and  installed  using  M&R  (P-722)  funds.  Only  two  flags  per GOQ may be purchased. Purchase of GO flags, state, and other organizational flags is not authorized.  Charge  authorized  flags  to  the  annual  $35,000  limits.  Examples  of  unified combatant  commands  are  Central  Command  (CENTCOM),  Southern  Command (SOUTHCOM),  Transportation  Command  (TRANSCOM),  and  Special  Operations Command (SOCOM). 3.3.6.9.  Exterior  Name  Sign.  Provide an exterior name sign as required using FH 722 funding. 3.3.6.10.  Historical  Name  Plaque.  Provide  a  name  plaque  to  serve  as  an  historical interior record of each resident using FH furnishings funds. 3.4.  Leased General Officer Quarters (GOQ). 3.4.1.  Air  Force  domestic  and  foreign  leased  GOQs  are  operated  and  assigned  as government- controlled housing. 3.4.2.  HMO  must  ensure  Leased  GOQs  comply  with  all  congressional  cost  limitations, including operations, maintenance and repair, and make ready cost (DoD Manual 4165.63). (T-0) 3.4.3.  See AFI 32-6001, Chapter 10 for leasing guidance, including the requirement for a 21-day congressional notification for foreign high-cost leases. 3.5.  Enterprise Military Housing (eMH).  eMH is the DoD enterprise information technology system for the operations and inventory management of DoD housing and has been designated as the authoritative data source for housing assets in DoD Real Property Databases. All other forms of  software  used  in  performing  property  management  and  inventory  control  of  government-provided furnishings are prohibited. 3.5.1.  Business  rules  outlining  the  mandatory  use  of  all  fields  and  modules  with  eMH  are located on the AF/A4C Portal, Housing Program Group Website.   AFI32-6003  14 APRIL 2016 31 3.5.2.  Business rules for Long Range Plans, Spend Plans and cost reporting will be provided annually by AF/A4C. 3.5.3.  Instructions  on  how  to  use  eMH  GFOM  to  develop  plans  and  record  costs  are provided on the eMH home page under housing training tools. 32 AFI32-6003  14 APRIL 2016 Chapter 4 PRIVATIZED GENERAL OFFICER QUARTERS (GOQ) 4.1.  Concept.  Air  Force  privatized  GOQs  are  managed  and  maintained  to  meet  the  unique functional  requirements  that  set  them  apart  from  other  privatized  FH.  The  laws,  rules, privatization TDs, and congressional GOQ language are all complex. Those responsible for GOQ Management  Teams  at  MAJCOMs,  HMO,  and  the  Privatized  Housing  PMO  must  understand and  convey  GOQ  policies,  standards,  and  processes  concisely  to  GOQ  residents  and  base leadership, and  consistently apply these fundamentals to  managing GOQs. GOQs receive close scrutiny  from  both  the  private  and  public  sector.  As  a  result,  GOQs  are  frequently  a  matter  of special congressional interest. 4.1.1.  Requirements set forth regarding privatized GOQs are only binding on the PO to the extent such requirements are mandated by law or incorporated into project TDs.  The PO is encouraged to comply with the privatized housing GOQ guidance but is not legally bound to do so unless stated in  project  TDs.   The Commander is  strongly  encouraged to  understand the differences between GOQ guidance and the TDs. 4.1.2.  The GOQ Management Team is the partnership between the Privatized Housing PMO and the government  HMO GOQ liaisons. The Team  manages day-to-day  operations for the privatized  GOQs  and  closely  interacts  with  residents.    The  Team  advises  installation leadership  on  all  GOQ  matters  and  provides  residents  timely  and  accurate  information  on plans, programs, and management actions related to their home. 4.1.3.  The government provides oversight of the privatization project activities of the GOQ Management  Team.  The  HMO  is  the  focal  point  for  furnishings,  force  protection,  official communications  equipment,  SCP  requirements,  cost  reporting,  and  informal  dispute resolution  between  the  resident  and  the  PO.  The  PO  owns  the  housing  facilities,  funds maintenance,  repair  and  capital  improvement  expenses,  and  directs  and  manages  the  work accomplished in and around GOQs. 4.1.4.  Congressional  interest  in  GOQs  remains  unchanged  with  the  advent  of  privatization.  As a result, there is legislatively mandated reporting of government and PO expenditures for privatized GOQs (Paragraph 4.4.1,  4.4.3 and Chapter 6). 4.1.5.  The key to maintaining GOQs is appropriately identifying facility work requirements. GOQ  resident  participation  in  this  process  is  vital.    The  PO  creates  an  annual  operating budget  for  all  homes,  including  GOQs,  in  agreement  with  the  project  closing  TDs.  The project  operating  budget  outlines  anticipated  income  and  expenses  (e.g.,  administrative, M&R,  utilities,  services,  taxes,  and  insurance)  and  anticipated  capital  improvements.    All work identified for GOQs should be consistent with appropriate Air Force facility standards. 4.2.  Planning and Programming. 4.2.1.  Annual Plan.  The PO is required to submit an annual budget to the government and senior  lender  for  approval.  It  generally  includes  an  operating  budget,  Capital  Repair  & Replacement (CR&R) Budget, and CR&R plan. A Five-Year Capital Improvement Plan for GOQ homes is submitted with the annual budget, if required in TDs.  AFI32-6003  14 APRIL 2016 33 4.2.1.1.  Operating  Budget.  The  operating  budget includes  anticipated  revenue, occupancy  projections,  M&R,  utilities,  taxes,  insurance,  and  management  fees  for  the project FY. Note: The project FY may not necessarily coincide with the government FY and  is  specified  in  closing  TDs.  Expenses  related  to  GOQ  units  may  or  may  not  be specifically identified in the operating budget. 4.2.1.2.  Capital  Repair  &  Replacement  (CR&R)  Budget.  The  CR&R  Budget identifies  planned  capital  improvements,  such  as  replacing  roofs,  appliances,  and playground equipment for the coming year. The CR&R Budget may or may not specify work for GOQ units, depending on the requirements specified in the closing TDs. 4.2.1.3.  Capital  Repair  and  Replacement  (CR&R)  Plan.  The  CR&R  Plan  identifies the  projected  CR&R  needs  of  the  project,  with  anticipated  funding  sources  for  the  50-year  term  of  the  lease.  The  CR&R  Plan  captures  facility  data,  identifies  improvements and  major  and  minor  M&R  requirements.    CR&R  projects  are  funded  by  the  CR&R account. 4.2.1.4.  Reinvestment  Account.  This  account  is  used  primarily  for  protecting  and enhancing the privatization project through reinvesting in community improvements such as whole house improvements or unit replacements. 4.3.  Funding  Sources.  Privatized  GOQ  operational  requirements  are  funded  using  either appropriated funds (APF) (government funds) or PO funds. 4.4.  Statutory Limits:  Congress and Air Force policy establish expenditure limits for GOQs. 4.4.1.  Operations,  Maintenance  and  Repair  (OMR):  10  U.S.C.  §  2831  limits  MFH funding for OMR expenditures to $35,000 annually per GOQ (Table 4.1). 4.4.1.1.  Do  not  exceed  the  OMR  threshold  without  prior  notification  to  Congress  or approval  to  notify  Congress  after-the  fact.  Requests  to  exceed  this  statutory  limit  are normally included in the annual President’s Budget. For unforeseen, urgent life, safety, or health  concerns  during  the  year  of  execution,  an  out-of-cycle  notification  to  exceed  the $35,000  statutory  limit  may  be  submitted.  SAF/IE  approves  all  out-of-cycle  requests, before  notification  is  sent  to  Congress  (similar  to  Paragraph  3.3.2  and    3.3.5  for government-owned/leased GOQs). 4.4.1.2.  Non-MFH  O&M  funds  used  to  support  GOQ  requirements  are  excluded  from OMR limits.  The HMO must be report  the costs on AF Form 3826.  (T-0) Table 4.1.  Operations, Maintenance and Repair (OMR) Annual Statutory Expenditure Limits for Privatized GOQs. 10 U.S.C. § 2831 placed a ceiling of $35,000 on all OMR expenditures per GOQ per FY. GOQ expenditures counted against the OMR annual limit include management (721.1), OPERATIONS, MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR (OMR) THRESHOLD 1. 2. services (721.2), furnishings (721.4) and M&R (722). Note: 722 funds may not be used in privatized housing. 4.4.2.  Extraordinary  Costs  and  Expenditures  (EC&E).  The  GOQ  Management  Team must track and report PO EC&E for all housing units, including GOQs. (T-1) 34 AFI32-6003  14 APRIL 2016 4.4.2.1.  The  GOQ  Management  Team  is  required  to  report  on  the  quarterly  AF  Form 3826 any unit with EC&E. (T-1) Costs exceeding $35,000 are reported to SAF/IEI. 4.4.2.2.  EC&E are typically costs resulting from changes, alterations or expansions to the physical layout of a dwelling. EC&Es are incurred when work exceeds normal M&R or replaces an item within its expected service life. It includes work that primarily benefits a resident  and is  not  necessary for the safe utilization, functionality, or habitability of the housing unit. 4.4.3.  10  USC  §  2884.  10  USC  §  2884  requires  the  Services  to  report  to  Congress  any privatized  GOQ  unit  where  the  total  PO  OMR  expenditures  exceed  $50,000  annually.  Unlike the 10 U.S.C. § 2831 statutory limits on MFH expenditures, this $50,000 threshold is a reporting “trigger” not a funding limit. As a result, no congressional or Air Force approval is  required  before  this  reporting  trigger  may  be  exceeded.  Even  though  congressional notification is not required before the $50,000 threshold is exceeded, it is important that the GOQ resident be aware of PO expenditures on their GOQ. See Chapter 6 for details on cost accounting and reporting.  4.5.  Daily  Operations.  Privatized  Housing  PMOs  provide,  maintain  and  manage  on-going support for GOQs, IAW project TDs. GOQ management teams should refer to these documents in  support of the daily operations, noting that in all cases, TDs prevail. Day-to-day items  to  be considered include: 4.5.1.  Change of Occupancy (COM).  COM work as specified in Paragraph 3.3.6.1. Since M&R tasks vary from installation to installation, TDs always prevail. 4.5.2.  Routine Maintenance and Repair (M&R).  M&R at the level of service specified in TDs. 4.5.3.  Maintaining Grounds.  Grounds care for GOQs IAW project TDs. 4.5.4.  Carpeting.  Carpeting  is  an  acceptable  floor  covering  in  GOQs.    The  installation should be done in a way to minimize stains and wear from traffic. 4.5.5.  Window Coverings.  Window coverings on all windows throughout the GOQ are an integral part of the GOQ. 4.5.6.  Appliances  and  Equipment.  Appliances and equipment (built-in and free-standing) in  GOQs  are  identified  in  the  project  TDs.  The  HMO  is  responsible  for  appliances  and equipment  authorized  under  supplemental  or  SCP  furnishings  that  were  not  originally conveyed to the PO (Paragraph  5.3.3). 4.6.  Self-Help.  Self-help guidance is in the tenant lease and Housing Resident Handbook. GOQ residents may not use the installation self-help facility (government-funded) to support privatized GOQ.  4.7.  Flags.  Project  TDs  may  include  a  requirement  that  the  Privatized  Housing  PMO  provide GOQs  an  American  flag,  a  Service  flag  and  an  appropriate  apparatus  (pole,  stanchion)  for display.  If project TDs do not include this requirement, the Air Force may negotiate with the PO to attempt to include this requirement. Appropriated funds may not be used to purchase any flags for privatized housing.  AFI32-6003  14 APRIL 2016 35 4.8.  Exterior Name Signs.  Project TDs may include a requirement that the Privatized Housing PMO provide GOQs with exterior names signs. If project TDs do not include this requirement, the  Air  Force  may  negotiate  with  the  PO  to  attempt  to  include  this  requirement.  Appropriated funds may not be used to purchase any exterior name signs for privatized housing.  4.9.  Historical  Name  Plaque.  HMO  coordinates  with  the  Privatized  Housing  PMO  for  the installation  of  a  name  plaque  to  serve  as  an  historical  interior  record  of  each  resident.    Name plaque is purchased using FH furnishings funds. 4.10.  Irrigation  Systems.  Project  TDs  may  include  a  requirement  that  the  PO  provide  and maintain  irrigation  systems  in  arid  and  semiarid  climates  IAW  guidance  in  AFI  32-6001.    If project TDs do not include this requirement, the Air Force may negotiate with the PO to attempt to include this requirement. 4.11.  Resident-Requested  Changes.  The  GOQ  Management  Team  refers  unresolved  GOQ resident  requests  that  are  outside  the  scope  of  the  project  TDs  to  the  Housing  Manager  for resolution. 4.12.  Enterprise  Military  Housing  (eMH).  Use  eMH  to  capture  annual  cost  associated  with privatized housing. PMO provides  expenditures to  the HMO  who updates eMH  with  data. The information as captured in the database is reported as part of AF Form 3826, GOQ Cost Report. 4.13.  Use of Appropriated Funds in Privatized Housing. 4.13.1.  Communications equipment that is readily removable and mission-required is funded with  non-MFH funds.  Installations do not  require additional authority to  install  this type of equipment.  Refer to Attachment 1 for the definition of readily removable communications equipment. 4.13.2.  AF organizations may fund permanent improvements to satisfy mission requirements in  privatized  housing,  under  the  limited  conditions  using  organizational  operations  and maintenance (non-MFH) funds.  The proposed improvements can only be required to support a non-housing mission related to communications equipment, secure information systems, or anti-terrorism/force protection. Design, solicitation, or construction cannot begin until written approval is obtained from SAF/IEI per the process outlined below:  4.13.2.1.  Installation Commander must submit the request to include justification for the proposed  work,  description  and  cost  of  the  proposed  work  and  required  equipment, certification of funds availability for construction and enduring sustainment, and a copy of  the  project  owner’s  concurrence  with  completing  the  proposed  work.  (T-0)  Funding for completing any approved improvements is the responsibility of the installation. 4.13.2.2.  Installation Commander forwards request to Director, Air Force Civil Engineer Center (AFCEC/CL) for coordination and determination that the proposed work is not the responsibility  of  the  privatized  project  owner.  Once  this  is  completed  AFCEC/CL forwards the package to the appropriate MAJCOM/CE. 4.13.2.3.  MAJCOM  staffs  (Civil  Engineer,  Communication,  Judge  Advocate,  and Finance) jointly determine that the requirement is mission essential; the required criteria are all met; and MAJCOM/CC approves this determination.  Note:    In  no  case  will  the individual exercising this authority make a decision about his or her dwelling or the dwelling  of  a  person  senior  in  rank.  Next  higher  authority  (AF/CV)  approval  is 36 AFI32-6003  14 APRIL 2016 required  for  requests  that  the  MAJCOM/CC  cannot  approve  to  include  CMSAF requirements.  Installation Commander will ensure: (T-1) 4.13.2.3.1.  The  proposed  alterations  are  incidental  to  and  essential  for  the accomplishment of the purpose of the appropriation. 4.13.2.3.2.  The cost of the alterations is reasonable. 4.13.2.3.3.  The improvement is used for the principal benefit of the government. 4.13.2.3.4.  The government interest in the improvements is protected. 4.13.2.4.  MAJCOM/CE for coordination and SAF/IEI approval prior to starting work. This request includes a copy of the MAJCOM/CC approval or a request for AF/CV approval if appropriate. the  approved  determination forwards to  AF/A4C 4.13.2.5.  For  purposes  of  this  policy,  permanent  improvements  are  defined  as maintenance,  repair,  alteration,  renovation,  or  construction  of  real  property,  which includes  the  housing  structure,  site  work,  infrastructure,  and  landscaping.  Permanent improvements  do  not  include  the  purchase,  maintenance,  and  repair  of  supplemental furnishings required for mission-related entertainment. 4.13.2.6.  This  policy  does  not  apply  to  funding  of  permanent  improvements  to  leased housing or housing owned by a foreign government. AFI32-6003  14 APRIL 2016 37 Chapter 5 GENERAL OFFICER QUARTERS (GOQ) FURNISHINGS ALLOWANCES 5.1.  Concept.  The  Air  Force  may  provide  furnishings  to  support  official  entertainment responsibilities of GOs, Brigadier General selectees, O-6 Installation Commanders, the CMSAF and  GO  civilian  equivalents  (Senior  Executive  Service)  residing  in  government-owned/leased and privatized housing.  Furnishings allowances vary between incumbents of Special Command Positions (SCP) and those in non-SCP positions. 5.1.1.  The  Air  Force  has  standardized  SCP  and  supplemental  furnishings  authorizations  to ensure items are prudent, reasonable, and consistent with OSD directives. 5.1.2.  Furnishings are provided only  for entertainment areas, defined as the entrance foyer, living room, dining room, den, library, family room, kitchen area, porches, patios, stairways and hallways and sidewalks connecting these areas, and, for SCPs only, a guest bedroom for official  guests  requiring  overnight  accommodations.  Note:  Not  all  areas  covered  under “entertainment  areas”  are  authorized  items.  Please  see  Attachment  3,  Table  A3.1  to determine what is authorized for non-SCPs and SCPs within each of the areas. 5.1.3.  Supplemental  furnishings  are  authorized  to  complement,  not  replace,  personally owned  furnishings  typically  expected  of  an  individual  of  this  grade  and  position,  and  are based on his or her grade and family size and composition. 5.1.4.  All  consumable  items  to  support  official  entertainment  via  Air  Force-provided furnishings  and  equipment  are  the  responsibility  of  the  resident  (i.e.  propane  gas,  cleaning supplies, etc.) 5.2.  Designation  for  Furnishings  Support.  GOs  may  receive  furnishings  support  for  official entertainment responsibilities based on their position designation. 5.2.1.  Special  Command  Position  (SCP).  OSD  (DA&M)  designates  certain  positions  as SCPs  which  establishes  an  authorization  for  additional  furnishings  and  amenities  in government-provided  and  privatized  housing.  An  SCP  is  a  position  occupied  by  a  GO  or civilian  GO-equivalent  that  carries  extensive  hosting  responsibilities  at  the  individual’s quarters  in  order  to  represent  the  interest  of  the  Nation.    See  Attachment  2  for  OSD designated AF-sponsored SCPs. incumbents  have  significantly  more 5.2.1.1.  SCP for  official entertainment  activities  and  are  often  housed  in  larger  GOQs.  Therefore,  SCPs  are authorized  additional  furnishings  in  entertainment  areas  and  furnishings  for  a  guest bedroom for official guests requiring overnight accommodations. responsibilities 5.2.1.2.  See  Paragraph    5.3  for  furnishings  allowances,  Paragraph    5.5  for  SCP additional allowances and amenities and Attachment 3, Table A3.1 for a detailed listing of  all  authorized  items.  FMS  will  not  purchase,  maintain,  repair,  or  replace  furnishings items not included in Attachment 3, Table A3.1 at government expense. (T-1) 5.2.2.  Non-Special  Command  Positions  (Non-SCP).  A  non-SCP  position  is  a  position occupied  by  a  GO,  Brigadier  General  selectee,  Colonel  (O-6)  serving  as  the  Installation Commander, CMSAF and a civilian GO-equivalent not designated as an SCP. 38 AFI32-6003  14 APRIL 2016 5.2.2.1.  Furnishings.  An  incumbent  of  a  non-SCP  position  as  defined  in  Paragraph  5.2.2  living  in  a  government-owned/leased  or  privatized  GOQ  (Target  Tenants  only) regardless of Service may be authorized supplemental furnishings support to meet official entertainment responsibilities. 5.2.2.1.1.  Commanders  approve  the  purchase  of  supplemental  furnishings  to complement not replace personally owned furnishings (Paragraph  5.1.3). 5.2.2.1.2.

Unaccompanied  members  and voluntarily  unaccompanied  members  residing  in  GOQs  receive  the  same  authorizations  to furnishings as accompanied members of equal grade. 5.3.  Furnishings  Allowances.  Air Force-authorized furnishings allowances for SCP and Non-SCPs  are  identified  in  Attachment  3,  Table  A3.1    MAJCOMs  may  submit  requests  for consideration of new furnishings authorizations to AF/A4C (Paragraph  5.3.4).  5.3.1.  Window  Treatments.  See  Attachment  1,  Terms,  for  the  definition  of  window treatments. Window treatments  (not to  be confused with  window coverings)  are considered furnishings and include draperies, curtains, sheers, rods, valances, cornices, fabric blinds and associated hardware. Ensure window treatments are neutral in color (may include white) and constructed  of  quality  materials  with  at  least  a  7-year  life  expectancy.    See  Paragraph  3.3.6.4 to note the difference between window treatments and window coverings. 5.3.1.1.  GOQs window treatments are only authorized in entertainment areas as shown in Attachment 3, Table A3.1 5.3.1.2.  Charge  all  GOQ  window  treatment  costs  against  the  OMR  threshold.  For  SCP homes, charge the cost of replacement window treatments against the annual furnishings limit of $10,000 and 5-year limit of $40,000.  For all other GOQs, charge the replacement cost  against  the  1-year  furnishings  limit  of  $6,000  and  5-year  limit  of  $20,000.    For initial-issue  window  treatments  required  due  to  new  construction  or  re-designation  of  a unit for GOQ/SCP, do not charge cost against the 1- year and 5-year limits. 5.3.1.3.  Cleaning  costs  for  window  treatments  are  reported  on  AF  Form  3826  under Section  I-1,  Line 3B, Furnishings  - Not Charged Against the  Limit. These costs are not subject to the 1-year or 5-year furnishings limits, but are charged against the annual OMR limit. 5.3.1.4.  Exceptions: 5.3.1.4.1.  The MAJCOM/CC may approve exceptions to the 7-year minimum life for window treatments. This authority may not be further delegated. In no case may the individual exercising this authority make a decision about his or her own GOQ or the GOQ of a person senior in rank.  5.3.1.4.2.  The Commander must justify requests to replace window treatments before the  7-year  period  has  expired.  (T-1)  Waivers  are  forwarded  to  the  MAJCOM/CE, which is the final approval authority. Waiver requests include:  AFI32-6003  14 APRIL 2016 39 5.3.1.4.2.1.  A  statement  that  the  BCE  has  validated  the  requirement  for replacement. 5.3.1.4.2.2.  Total cost of the replacement items. 5.3.1.4.2.3.  Clearly requirement. labeled  floor  plan  and  photographs  documenting the 5.3.1.4.2.4.  The month and year the items requiring replacement were originally installed  or  placed  in  the  GOQ.  State  whether  the  items  are  still  under manufacturer warranty, and include available warranty information. 5.3.1.4.2.5.  Explain why early replacement is necessary. Include a description of all  furnishings  actions  and  costs  completed  and  proposed  for  the  FY;  and  the annual  and  long-range  plans,  including  furnishings  and  how  the  furnishings  will be maintained with future expenditure limits. 5.3.2.  Government  Appliances.  The  BCE  provides  freestanding  or  permanently  installed appliances  for  government-owned/leased  GOQs  IAW  Attachment  3,  Table  A3.1,  Part  C. To  determine  the  proper  cost  category,  use  the  principle  that  installed  is  an  M&R  cost  (P-722), and  freestanding is  an operations cost  (P-721). Charge subsequent  costs incurred for the item (maintenance, repair or replacement) to the same cost category initially assigned to the appliance. 5.3.2.1.  Authorized  appliances  and  equipment  for  GOQs  are  listed  in  Attachment  3, Table A3.1, Part C. 5.3.2.2.  Charge  cost  to  buy,  install,  maintain  and  repair  built-in  appliances,  such  as dishwasher or built-in  oven or cook top,  to  the  appropriate M&R category, Section  I-3, AF Form 3826. 5.3.2.3.

Additional  appliances  authorized  under  supplemental  furnishings  (Attachment 3,  Table  A3.1)  that  are  not  built  in,  are  provided,  maintained,  and  replaced  by  the government (Paragraph  4.5.6). 5.3.3.  Privatized Housing Appliances.  IAW project TDs, the PO should provide, maintain, and  replace  ranges,  refrigerators,  and  built-in  appliances  in  privatized  GOQs,  both  PO-provided and government-conveyed (Paragraph  4.5.6). 5.3.4.  Requesting New  Items.  When new furnishings, appliances, or equipment items, not included  in  this  AFI,  are  needed,  the  MAJCOM  submits  a  request  with  supporting documentation  to  AF/A4C.  State  the  cost;  describe  the  item  and  proposed  location  in  the entertainment area of the GOQ; and include other available information (brochures, sketches, and  photographs).    If  AF/A4C  determines  the  item  is  appropriate  for  Air  Force-wide application, after SAF/IEE approval, the new SCP or supplemental furnishings item will be added to this AFI and MAJCOM/CEs notified.   40 AFI32-6003  14 APRIL 2016 5.4.  Furnishings Cost Limits. 5.4.1.  All furnishings costs count against the OMR annual limit.  The annual and five-year cost limits are not a budget for GOQs. 5.4.1.1.  Special Command Position (SCP).  Limit expenditures for furnishings charged against the limit (Attachment 3,  Table A3.1,  Part  A) to $10,000 per SCP per FY, and $40,000 per SCP over a 5-year consecutive period. 5.4.1.2.  Non-Special  Command  Position  (Non-SCP).  For  non-SCP  GOQs,  limit expenditures  for  furnishings  charged  against  the  limit  to  $6,000  per  GOQ  per  FY  and $20,000 over a 5-year period. 5.4.2.  The 1-year and 5-year limits apply to new items taken from existing FMS warehouse stock  that  have  never  been  charged  to  a  GOQ.

In no case  may  the  individual  exercising  this  authority  make  a  decision  about  his  or  her  own dwelling  or  the  dwelling  of  a  person  senior  in  rank.  If  necessary,  use  date  of  rank  to determine authority. 5.4.3.3.  All furnishings costs count against the OMR annual limit.  If waiving the 1-year and/or 5- year limit also causes the project OMR costs to exceed $35,000 (government) for  that  FY,  obtain  appropriate  additional  approvals  prior  to  incurring  additional furnishing costs. 5.4.3.4.  The justification for all waiver requests includes: 5.4.3.4.1.  A statement validating the requirement to exceed the cost limits, including an explanation for exceeding costs. 5.4.3.4.2.  List of items requested, including costs. 5.4.3.4.3.  Description of furnishings actions completed (with costs), and furnishings actions proposed for the FY. AFI32-6003  14 APRIL 2016 41 5.4.3.4.4.  Spend and long-range plans for GOQs. The plans should show an ability to maintain quality furnishings within the expenditure limits in future FYs. 5.5.  Special  Command  Position  (SCP)  Additional  Allowances.  SCP  incumbents  residing  in government-owned/leased  and  privatized  GOQs  (Paragraph    5.2.1)  may  be  provided  special allowances  and  amenities.  For  non-Air  Force  SCPs  supported  at  AF  installations,  ensure  items provided by their primary Service are considered before issuing additional items. 5.5.1.  Tableware  and  Linen  Allowance.  The  Air  Force  has  standardized  tableware authorizations.  IAW  Attachment  3,  Table  A3.1,  Part  B,  china,  glassware,  flatware,  and silver  service  (serving  pieces)  and  table  linen  are  subject  to  a  $1,000  annual  replacement allowance.  Housing Managers are responsible for tracking and reporting these expenditures on cost reports.  These items are not charged against the 1-year and 5-year furnishing limits, but  are  charged  against  the  annual  OMR  limit.    Quantities  are  limited  per  Part  B.  FMS,  in coordination  with  the  HMO,  must  submit  all  waivers  via  AF/A4C  for  approval  by  AF/CV. (T-1) 5.5.1.1.  Tableware (China, Glassware, Flatware, Silver Service).  The initial issue of SCP tableware is not subject to the $1,000 annual replacement allowance but included in the  annual  OMR  limit.  Replacement  items  are  charged  against  the  $1,000  limit  and  the annual OMR limit. 5.5.1.1.1.  Authorized  tableware  items  are  accountable  and  must  be  itemized  and accounted for on an AF Form 228 by the FMS in coordination with the HMO. (T-0) 5.5.1.1.2.  At  the  request  of  the  resident  or  designated  representative,  the  Housing Manager  initiates  a  request  for  replacement  items  (via  e-mail)  to  the  Air  Force Tableware  Program  and  Amenities  Representative,  11  Wing,  Logistic  Readiness Squadron (WG/LRS). 5.5.1.1.2.1.  The  11  WG/LRS  representative  reviews  the  request  based  on authorized  quantities  and  current  issue,  and,  in  turn,  provides  the  Housing Manager a written cost for replacement. 5.5.1.1.2.2.  The  Housing  Manager  verifies  that  sufficient  funds  remain  on  the annual limits.  5.5.1.1.2.3.  As appropriate, the Housing Manager notifies 11 WG/LRS to finalize request for item and the FMS forwards the item to be replaced via certified mail to  the  Air  Force  Tableware  Program  and  Amenities  Representative,  11  LRS, Tableware  Program  and  Amenities  Representative,  3066  E.  Perimeter  Rd,  JB Andrews MD 20762. The 11 LRS arranges for precious metals in these items to be reclaimed. 5.5.1.1.3.  Upon  receiving  request  for  items  to  be  replaced,  the  11  LRS  sends  the replacement  item  to  the  Installation  FMS  and  notifies  the  Housing  Manager  of shipment. 5.5.1.1.4.  After receiving the replacement item, FMS notifies the Housing Manager, updates the AF Form 228 and issues the replacement item to the resident. 5.5.1.1.5.  The 11 WG/LRS notifies the HMO upon receiving items directly from the resident or Aide (Paragraph 1.2.18,  1.1.19) and initiates actions for reconciliation. 42 AFI32-6003  14 APRIL 2016 5.5.1.1.6.  Annually, by 1 March, the 11 LRS provides AF/A4CFH a total inventory and reconciliation of tableware on hand and issued.  5.5.1.1.7.  Quarterly,  by  the  10th  day  following  the  end  of  the  quarter,  11  WG/LRS provides AF/A4CFH a transaction summary by base and address. 5.5.1.1.8.  11 LRS will use eMH to track inventory and accountability. (T-0) 5.5.1.2.  Table Linen.  As a minimum, each SCP may maintain a set of 48 placemats, 48 napkins, and up to 12 tablecloths (white or neutral), depending on size and shape of the primary dining table. 5.5.1.2.1.  Table  linens  are  accountable  and  are  itemized  on  AF  Form  228. Unserviceable linen is turned in to FMS for disposal and adjustment to the AF Form 228. 5.5.1.2.1.1.  Housing  Managers  may  purchase  replacement  linens  (P-721.41-42) locally, using the Government Purchase Card (GPC). 5.5.1.2.1.2.  SCPs  may  purchase  replacement  linens  using  personal  funds.  The Housing Manager processes Standard Form (SF) 1164, Claim for Reimbursement for  Expenditures  on  Official  Business,  to  the  Financial  Services  Office  for reimbursement. 5.5.1.2.2.  Table  linen  may  be  cleaned  at  government  expense  with  P-721.41-.42 funds. Report cost on AF Form 3826, Section I-1, Line 3B, Furnishings, not charged against the limit; these expenses are charged against the annual OMR limit. 5.5.2.  Miscellaneous  Supplemental  Allowance.  The  Air  Force  provides  SCPs  an additional  $1,000  allowance  for  items  required  for  official  entertainment,  such  as  small cookware,  hollowware  (serving  pieces),  and  other  items  required  for  entertainment  but  not listed in Attachment 3, Table A3.1  The items are not charged against the 1-year and 5-year furnishings limits but are charged against the annual OMR limit. 5.5.2.1.  Purchase authorized items with P-721 funds, and report the items under the SCP miscellaneous  supplemental  allowance  cost  category  (AF  Form  3826,  Section  I-1,  Line 3D). These expenses are charged against the annual OMR limit. 5.5.2.2.  The  Housing  Manager  or  designated  representative  may  purchase  items  locally using the GPC. When SCPs purchase authorized items using personal funds, the Housing Manager processes an SF 1164 claim to the Financial Services Office for reimbursement. 5.5.2.3.  Authorized items are accountable and must be itemized on AF Form 228 by the FMS.  (T-1)  Items  remain  the  property  of  the  GOQ  until  determined  unserviceable,  at which time the items are turned in to FMS for disposal and adjustment of Form 228.  5.6.  Furnishings  Accountability.  GOs  are  accountable  for  government-issued  furnishings placed in their GOQ and liable for damages. Furnishings items are recorded on AF Form 228 and signed  for  by  the  GO,  spouse  or  designated  representative  (including  Enlisted  Aides).  FMS maintains the AF Form 228, receives unserviceable items for disposal, and adjusts the AF Form 228.  The FMS and the resident should conduct an annual inventory and perform reconciliation actions, as needed. AFI32-6003  14 APRIL 2016 43 Chapter 6 COST ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING 6.1.  Concept.  By congressional and OSD direction, the Air Force is required to report all GOQ expenditures (government and privatized). This requirement applies to all expenditures on all Air Force  GOQs  (government-owned/leased  and  privatized).    Government  costs  for  government-owned  GOQs  temporarily  diverted  as  unaccompanied  GOQs  are  paid  exclusively  from  MFH funds and all limits apply.  See AFI 32-6001 for guidance on leased GOQs that are being used to house unaccompanied GOs.  It is imperative to track and accurately account for all GOQ costs to ensure limits (law or policy) are not exceeded and to accomplish reporting requirements. 6.1.1.  The  BCE  appoints  a  single  POC  whose  responsibility  is  to  ensure  proper  collection, recording, and certification of GOQ costs. This POC monitors and validates costs frequently to  make  sure  sufficient  authorizations  exist  before  approving  additional  expenditures  in  the GOQ. The POC initiates quarterly and annual GOQ cost reports. (T-1) 6.1.2.  The BCE must ensure GOQ residents are aware of all work required and performed in their  homes,  including  cost  estimates  prior  to  work,  if  desired.  (T-0)  Residents  should  also review expenditures included on their cost reports. Residents (if available at the duty station) sign quarterly cost  reports acknowledging expenditures, and return the original signed copy to the BCE or the HMO.  6.2.  Tracking  and  Reporting  General  Officer  Quarters  (GOQ)  Costs.  The eMH GFOM is used  to  track  and  report  both  government  (APF)  and  PO  expenditures  on  government- owned/leased  and  privatized  GOQs  (units  occupied  by  GOs  as  either  Target  Tenants  or  Other Eligible  Tenants).    The  HMO  is  responsible  to  collect  and  record  GOQ  expenditures (government  and  PO)  using  the  current  Air  Force  GOQ  Cost  collection  processes.  The  HMO collects  government  expenditures  from  the  Air  Force  CE  Resource  Advisor  and  other offices/agencies,  as  required.  The  Privatized  Housing  PMO  provides  PO  expenditures  to  the HMO  using  the  PO  Cost  Workbook  (Sample  located  A4C  Housing  Portal  Page),  quarterly  not later than the end of the first month following the end of the quarter.  Installations must develop and maintain a separate GFOM Quarterly Cost Report (QCR) for each GOQ to track and report costs of government and PO operations, maintenance, repair and improvement actions. (T-0) For government-owned/leased  GOQs,  there  are  no  PO  costs  reported,  since  this  source  of  funds  is not applicable for these GOQs.  6.3.  When  to  Charge  and  Report  Costs.  In  general,  charge  and  report  annual  costs  the  date funds  are  obligated.  However,  for  multiunit  service  contracts,  where  funds  are  obligated  when the contract is awarded, charge costs to individual GOQs as expenses are incurred. Examples of these contracts are housing maintenance, grounds maintenance and refuse collection. 6.3.1.  Contract Costs.  For contracted project work, charge and report the entire cost of the work (labor plus materials) at the time the contract is awarded. Report changes to costs prior to  end-of-year  (fourth  quarter  reports)  when  the  contract  change  is  approved.  Once  annual reports  have  been  submitted  through  the  MAJCOM  to  AF/A4CF,  submit  updated  reports only  if  a  cost  change  would  affect  statutory  or  regulatory  compliance.    However,  the installation retains updated AF Forms 3826 incorporating the changes, at the installation. 44 AFI32-6003  14 APRIL 2016 6.3.2.  In-house  Costs.  For  in-house  work,  charge  and  report  the  cost  of  materials  as  they are received.  Charge and report labor for in-house work at the time the hours are expended.  For  government-owned/leased  GOQs,  when  military  or  civilian  labor,  other  than  enlisted aides, performs housing work, the cost for the reported labor hours is based on the total shop rate, less the military factor. 6.4.  Cost  Categories.  All  costs  (government  and  PO)  for  operations,  utilities,  M&R,  leasing, and  improvement  of  a  GOQ  and  associated  real  property  must  be  tracked  and  reported  by  the HMO. (T-0)  Attachment 4 provides detailed instructions for costing and reporting government and  PO  expenditures  in  all  categories.    For  quick  reference  see  tables  regarding  government funds, PO funds and furnishings limits on the A4C CE Housing Portal page.  6.4.1.  Government Funds. 6.4.1.1.  Operations  Costs.

Charge each piece of furniture to a GOQ only once. Examples: 6.4.1.1.1.1.  For  an  item  purchased  for  a  specific  GOQ,  charge  it  to  that  GOQ when  the  item  is  ordered.    When  no  longer  required  by  a  successive  resident, return the item to FMS inventory for use by other authorized residents. 6.4.1.1.1.2.  For  an  item  taken  new  from  FMS  stock  as  a  first-time  issue  to  a GOQ, charge it to that GOQ when it is issued. 6.4.1.1.1.3.  For an item issued from FMS stock but previously issued and used in another GOQ, charge only for transportation and handling. 6.4.1.1.2.  Window treatments, including initial issue, replacement, and cleaning. 6.4.1.1.3.  Area rugs, including initial issue, replacement, and cleaning.

Determine O&M costs for GOQs in one of two ways, and charge accordingly: 6.5.1.  If the costs are solely attributable to a GOQ, such as a maintenance project or contract cleaning for an individual unit, charge the entire cost to the GOQ. 6.5.2.  If two or more units benefit from services (e.g., refuse collection, maintenance, shared garage),  prorate  the  costs  among  all  benefiting  units.    For  utilities  where  units  are  not metered,  determine  a  cost  per  square  foot  and  establish  the  charge  based  on  the  unit  size (Paragraph  A4.2). 6.5.3.  Charge  costs  to  maintain  and  repair  irrigation  systems  within  50 feet  of  the  GOQ  to that GOQ. If two or more units share an irrigation system, prorate the costs among all GOQs sharing  the  system,  but  in  all  cases  charge  only  the  cost  within  50  feet  of  each  GOQ.  This policy  is  specific  to  irrigation  systems,  and  the  "exclusive  use"  provision  in  Paragraph  3.3.6.2 does not apply. 6.6.  How to Charge Project Owner Costs.  The Privatized Housing PMO provides costs to the HMO  at  the  end  of  each  quarter  using  the  PO  Cost  Workbook.  The  HMO  is  responsible  to transfer  the  costs  from  the  PO  Cost  Workbook  to  the  appropriate  line  in  the  GOQ’s  QCR. Attachment 4, Paragraph  A4.9-12 discusses each category of PO costs. 6.7.  Reporting  Requirements.  Record  expenditures  for  each  GOQ  quarterly  as  prescribed  in Attachment 4.  Include government and PO costs for the entire year even if a GO only occupies the unit for a portion of the FY. 6.7.1.  At the end of each quarter, installations submit their quarterly cost reports (QCRs) for MAJCOM approval through GFOM.  MAJCOMs review the QCRs and either coordinate on the report or return it for further action. For the first and second quarters of each FY, once the MAJCOM coordinates on the QCR, it is returned to the installation for further reporting. For the  third  and  fourth  quarter  of  the  FY,  once  the  MAJCOM  coordinates  on  the  QCR  it  is forwarded  to  the  HAF  GOQ  POC.    HAF  reviews  each  QCR  and  either  coordinates  on  the report  or  returns  it  for  further  action.    Once  HAF  completes  3rd  quarter  coordination,  the report is returned through the MAJCOM to the installation for further reporting. Once HAF completes  4th  quarter  coordination  the  QCR  is  locked  for  editing  by  the  MAJCOM  and/or the installation.  If further changes to the QCR  are necessary at this point, they can only  be done by the HAF GOQ POC. 6.7.2.  AF Form 3826. At the end of quarter the installation will print an AF Form 3826 and detailed transaction for each GOQ using the report function of GFOM.  (T-1) 6.7.2.1.  The  Housing  Manager  and  BCE  must  sign  the  government  and  privatized section of the AF Form 3826;  the Privatized Housing PMO representative signs the PO section. (T-0) 6.7.2.2.  GOQ  residents  (if  available  at  the  duty  station)  must  review  and  sign  the  AF Form  3826  to  acknowledge  expenditures.  (T-1)  The  HMO  representative  furnishes  the GOQ resident a copy of signed AF Form 3826.  6.7.2.3.  Once  the  AF  Form  3826  is  signed  the  installation  will  upload  the  signed  AF Forms 3826 plus detailed transaction sheets to the GFOM database. (T-0) In addition, the installation will upload the following documentation as needed: (T-1) AFI32-6003  14 APRIL 2016 47 6.7.2.3.1.  Copy of all grounds maintenance waivers for non-SCPs. 6.7.2.3.2.  Approved waivers to the $3,000 annual limit for minor alteration costs (or status of waiver request). 6.7.2.3.3.  DD  Form  1391  and  cost  data  for  any  GOQ  minor  improvement  project completed during the reporting FY. 6.7.2.3.4.  Waivers  to  GOQ  furnishings  limits  and  waivers  for  early  replacement  of drapery and carpeting. 6.7.2.3.5.  Receipt  for  tableware  and  linens,  with  description,  itemization,  cost, recipient, location, and date of issuance. 6.7.2.4.  Retain  AF  Forms  3826  and  detailed  worksheets  for  5  years  to  support  5-year furnishings limitations. 6.7.3.  Using the approved QCRs for each FY, AF/A4CF consolidates and formats the GOQ expenditure data and sends it to SAF/IE, through SAF/IEE and SAF/IEI for approval. Once approved,  the  AF  report  is  forwarded  through  the  Assistant  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  for Financial  Management  and  Comptroller  (SAF/FM)  to  OSD  Comptroller  (OSD(C))  who submits it to Congress. 6.7.4.  After annual reports have been submitted, submit a revised AF Form 3826 when cost changes  to  a  contract  would  affect  statutory  or  regulatory  compliance.    However,  the installation retains updated AF Forms 3826 incorporating the changes, at the installation. 6.8.  Occupancy Period for Cost Reporting: 6.8.1.  Report all government and PO costs for the entire FY if the GO (including a “frocked” GO) occupies the GOQ for any part of the FY. Do not report OMR costs for a housing unit designated  for  GO  use  but  not  occupied  by  a  GO  at  any  time  during  the  FY.    A  brigadier general  select  is  not  considered  a  GO  for  purposes  of  reporting  costs;  however,  when  the brigadier general select is promoted to O-7, initiate OMR cost reporting for the entire FY. 6.8.2.  When a GO occupies a unit not previously occupied by a GO during the same FY, the FH  O&M  $35,000  OMR  limit,  10  USC  §  2884  $50,000  reporting  trigger,  and  annual  cost reporting requirement applies.  To avoid an ADA (Title 31 U.S.C. §1341) violation, analyze all FH O&M OMR expenditures to date and expenditures anticipated for the remainder of the FY.    If  it  appears  statutory  limits  may  be  exceeded  for  the  FY,  determine  if  anticipated expenditures  can  be  adjusted  to  remain  within  the  FH  O&M  OMR  limit.  If  not,  submit  an out-of-cycle budget request to exceed the OMR limit. Do not allow the resident to move into the unit until it is certain that sufficient authority is available to adequately support the GO resident within the OMR limit for the balance of the FY. 6.8.3.  If a GO occupies a unit for a portion of the FY and upon departure the unit is occupied by a non-GO during the same FY, the HMO must report the unit as a GOQ for that FY. (T-0) The  $35,000  OMR  limit  for  total  FY  expenditures  continues  to  apply.    All  OMR expenditures for the balance of the FY are reported against $35,000 annual limit. If it appears statutory limits may be exceeded for the FY, determine if anticipated FH O&M expenditures can  be  adjusted  to  remain  within  the  OMR  limit.  If  not,  submit  an  out-of-cycle  budget request to exceed the limit. Do not allow the resident to move into the unit until it is certain AFI32-6003  14 APRIL 2016 that  sufficient  authority  is  available  to  adequately  support  the  non-GO  resident  for  the balance of the FY.  6.8.4.  For  unique  situations,  consult  with  the  MAJCOM  to  avoid  exceeding  these  limits without prior authority. 48  JOHN B.
