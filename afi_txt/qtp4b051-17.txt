Open the WBGT kit. 5.  Lift the thermometer assembly up and out using the “lift here” tab. 6.  Wet the wet bulb wick thoroughly with distilled water. 7.  Position the kit with the thermometers toward the sun2. 8.  Allow the black globe to be exposed to the sun at least 25 minutes before recording readings. 9.  Record the temperatures wet bulb (WB), dry bulb (DB), and black globe (GT) temperatures. 10.  Calculate the WBGT index3. 11.  Determine the correct metabolic rate class (see AFPAM 48-151, Table A2.1). 12.  Determine the correct reference value (see AFPAM 48-151, Table A2.1). 13.  Determine correct stage (see AFPAM 48-151, Table A2.2)4.   Cold Stress: 14.  Determine the wind chill temperature (see AFPAM 48-151, Table A4.1). 15.  Determine proper wind chill condition (see AFPAM 48-151, Table A4.2).   LOCAL REQUIREMENTS: None  NOTES: 1.  Readings should be taken at a location representative of the conditions to which workers are exposed.  2.  Ensure the dry bulb is shielded from direct sunlight. Expose the black globe to direct sunlight.  3.  To calculate the outdoor WBGT with direct sunlight, all three temperatures (WB, DB, and GT) are needed. To calculate an indoor or outdoor WBGT without direct sunlight, only the wet bulb temperature and black globe temperature are needed.  Equation is available below.

Hot environment, heat generating sources such as welding, increased levels of PPE that elevate heat stress levels. 2.  Engineering Controls for Heat Stress are directed toward reducing physical work demands, reducing external heat gain from the air and hot surfaces, and enhancing external heat loss by increasing sweat evaporation and decreasing air temperature. Examples include: dilution ventilation, active cooling, shielding and etc. 3.  Administrative Controls for Heat Stress change the way work is performed in order to limit exposures or risks. For heat stress, they are directed toward limiting exposures so that increases in heart rate and core temperature do not exceed accepted limits. Administrative controls include: acclimatization, work/rest cycles, pace of work, sharing work, fluid intake, scheduling of work and etc.  4.  PPE Controls for Heat Stress provides protection for individual workers. For heat stress, PPE is primarily in the form of personal cooling, but can include reflective clothing for high-radiant heat conditions. Keep in mind that PPE is used as a last resort, when other control measures are not feasible or available. Examples include: ice garments/vests, reflective clothing, personal air cooling systems and etc. 5.  Engineering Controls for Cold Stress reduce heat loss from the person as a whole or from exposed skin. They include the following: general/spot heating such as heaters, temporary shelters, shielding and etc. 6.  Administrative Controls for Cold Stress that help reduce the exposure time, allow individual control over the work, and provide for mutual observation include the following: Example:  work/warm cycles, work scheduling practices, moving work to warmer areas, buddy system and etc. 7.  PPE Controls for Cold Stress are fundamental in managing cold stress. Personal protective equipment includes the following: properly selected insulating clothing, layer clothing, active warming systems such as hand/foot warmers and etc. 10              AFQTP 4B051-17                                               TRAINEE REVIEW QUESTIONS                           Journeyman Training Guide:  Thermal Stress       STS Line Item 4.12.4:  Recommend thermal stress controls  How long does it take for someone to become adapted (acclimated) to a new climate? 1.   2.
