Purpose of the AFI. This instruction assigns responsibilities and prescribes policies and proceduresfor standardizing and modernizing Air Force (AF) physical training (PT) in concert with AFI 10-248, Fit-ness Program and sister-service directives. The AF will use PT Courses (PTC) and Conditioning ObstacleCourses (COC) to train Airmen re alistically, consistent with current and future doctrine, threat analysis,and force structure. The AF will realize economy in developing these training ranges while ensuring theseranges support the training required  by the fielding of new and improve d ground warrior tactics, tech-niques, and procedures as well as  published environmental, safety, and health guidance. Furthermore, itprovides broad administrative, management and operational guidance for the AF Obstacle Course Pro-gram Manager (OCPM) and subordinate command level obstacle course programs. Deviations from thisinstruction are not authorized  unless approved by AF OCPM. Sub mit proposed changes through yourchain of command to AF/A3O-AS  (AF OCPM), 1480 AF Pentagon , Washington DC 20330-1480 andAF/A3O-AS Workflow (scats.xoos@pentagon.af.mil) on AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change ofPublication. 1.2.  AF Obstacle Courses. The AF has developed two categories  of courses defined as the Obst acleCourse Program (OCP) to provide al ternate PT, enhance confidence in  physical abilities, build dynamicleadership problem solving under physical stress and to enhance understanding of teamwork while devel-oping fundamental warrior ethos. The MAJCOM/A3 maintains  overall responsibility and approvalauthority for Airmen utilizing obstacle courses within their Command. 1.2.1.  Category I: PTC. This course is designed for every Airman in  the AF with low obstacles thatmust be negotiated quickly. Running the course can be a test of th e Airman’s basic motor skills andphysical conditioning. These courses  should be run as an alternat e form of physical conditioning.They provide an opportunity for an entire body workout within the normal AF PT program and shouldnot be used as  a pass/fail training  tool unless specifically requir ed by Air Force Specialty Code(AFSC) or unit. CAT I obstacles are designed for crawling,  jumping, dodging, traversing, climbing,vaulting and balancing. These obstacles will not have an ORM seve rity assessment above negligiblewith a residual risk of Lo w after implementation of c ounter-measures IAW AFPAM 90-902, Opera-tional Risk Management (ORM) Guidance and Tools.  1.2.2.  Category II: COC. This course is designed with higher and more di fficult obstacles than thePTC. The COC can be run for time or used to enhance the confidence, mental and physical abilities ofthe Airmen while cultivating the warrior ethos. If not used as a timed event; Airmen are encouraged,but not forced to complete each obstacle. CAT II obstacles will not have a potential fall distance above14 feet without a direct connection to safety lines attended by a qualified, trained safety observer or afull-body-harness with lanyard a ttached to a supporting structur e IAW Association of ChallengeCourse Technology or like standa rds. These obstacles will not ha ve an ORM severity assessmentabove moderate with a residual  risk of Low after implementation of counter-measures IAW AFPAM90-902. CAT II obstacles not listed in  Attachment 3 must get AF OCPM approval prior to use IAWparagraph 5.3.3. CAT I obstacles are approved for use on a CAT II course. NOTE: MAJCOM/A3s may authorize the use of individual kit (load bearing equipment, rucksack, etc.)on all AF obstacle courses. AFI36-2202   7 AUGUST 200751.3.  Alternate Insertion and Extraction (AIE) and mountaineering training walls. The AF has addi-tional AIE and m ountaineering operational requirements which are cove red by other service and jointdirectives. These training aids (Fast Rope / Rappel Towers and Climbing Walls) will not be covered underthis instruction and will remain under the operational directives and specific AFSC training and Standard-ization and Evaluation (Stan/Eval) guidance. These training aids, regardless of location, will remain avail-able for those Airmen with documented training requirements. 1.4.  Fire Training Facilities. The AF has additional fi re training facilities wh ich are covered by AFI32-2001, The Fire Protection Operations and Fire Prevention Program. These fire training facilities areused for training specific to the Civil Engineering career field and will not be covered under this instruc-tion. 1.5.  Medical Readiness Training. AF medical personnel are required to train on stretcher carrying tech-niques in a variety of simulated  terrain conditions IAW AFI 41-106,  Medical Readiness Planning andTraining. The Medical Readiness Training Site at Sheppard AFB TX maintains these training courses andthey will not be covered under this instruction. 1.6.  Academic Leadership and Development Courses. Academic Leadership and Developmentcourses are designed to promote teamwork and camaraderie in the Professional Military Education envi-ronment. By definition these co urses will not include any obstacles  with a residual ORM assessmentabove negligible. Examples of this course are Project X, Lead ership Reaction Courses, and AssaultCourses currently being utilized by Air University  and the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA).These academic leadership and development courses will adhere to the following: 1.6.1.  The course owner completes an inspection, identifies off-limits areas, and completes an ORMbrief to mitigate training risk. Base safety assists as requested. 1.6.2.  Base/installation commander (o r equivalent) authorizes the use  of the course after re viewingthe conditions and risks associated with the training events. 1.6.3.  Base/installation commander (or equivalent) en sures all instructors and safety observers areexperienced with the training events, understand the ORM techniques, risk mitigation implementationprocedures, and that they provide a safety and ORM brief to all participants prior to use. 1.6.4.  Courses in question will be referred to  the MAJCOM Obstacle Course Program Manager(OCPM) for clarification. If the MAJCOM OCPM is unable to provide the required guidance/clarifi-cation, the issue will be addressed to the AF OCPM. 1.7.  Ropes Course. These are commercial “Challe nge Courses” installed,  operated and inspected inaccordance with Association of Challenge Course Technology (ACCT) standards. These courses are spe-cifically designed to bui ld leadership, trust, team-building and prob lem resolution skills. Examples ofthese courses are the USAFA ropes course and the rope s course at select ANG  installations and trainingsites. Ropes courses meeting these criteria are approved for use with the following oversight: 1.7.1.  The course owner completes an inspection, identifies off-limits areas, and completes an ORMbrief to mitigate training risk (any obstacles with a residual ORM assessment above negligible will notbe used). Base safety assists as requested. 6AFI36-2202   7 AUGUST 20071.7.2.  Base/installation commander (or equivalent) en sures all instructors and safety observers areexperienced with the training events, understand the ORM techniques, risk mitigation implementationprocedures, and that they provide a safety and ORM brief to all participants prior to use. 1.7.3.  Use of of f-base commercial Challenge Courses by the ANG requires  approval through heMAJCOM OCPM (NGB). 1.7.4.  Courses in question will be referred to the MAJCOM OCPM for clarification. If the MAJCOMOCPM is unable to provide the required guidance/clarification, the issue will be forwarded to the AFOCPM. 1.8.  Sister-Services, Coalition Forces or Other Outside Agencies Requesting Use of AF ObstacleCourse(s). Sister-service or coalition units may utilize existing AF obstacle courses using their applicableguidance and directives or this AFI.  Outside agencies may utilize existing courses with base/installationcommander (or equivalent) approv al. These agencies will conduct operations in accordance with thisinstruction when lacking their own published guidance or directives. 1.9.  AF Use of Sister-Service or Coalition Unit Obstacle Course(s). AF units may us e Sister-serviceor coalition unit obstacle course(s) with MAJCOM/A3 approval. MAJCOM OCPMs will establish proce-dures for request/approval of Sister -service or coalition unit courses fo r unilateral AF use. Airmen whoare attached to a sister -service, joint unit, or coal ition unit, may utilize the co urse with, and under thedirect control of that unit. 1.10.  References.

This chapter outlines safety requirements and areas for considerationprior to any obstacle course use by AF personnel. 3.2.  Operational Risk Management. The installation commander will ap point an installation OCPMfor all issues pertaining to the course. The installation commander will ensure an ORM analysis is initiallyaccomplished and documented upon appointment and updated whenever procedures, obstacles, or condi-tions of the course change. 3.2.1.  Application of ORM is an important element for protecting our Airmen. The ORM process pro-vides leaders and individuals a systematic approach to make risk decisions. 3.2.2.  An effective ORM assessment is critical to obstacle course management. OCPMs and courseofficials must analyze and attempt to anticipate as ma ny hazards and associat ed risks as possiblebefore allowing personnel to attempt to negotiate th e obstacle course. Risk is the potential for injuryor loss, and is present at every obstacle course. It is measured by several factors including the potentialseverity and the probability of occurrence. Hazards are conditions that have the potential to negativelyimpact course negotiation by partic ipants. To manage risk, identify  potential hazards, then, take thesteps necessary to prioritize and mitigate the potential hazards. Risk management is based on an accu-rate perception and i ncludes all probable options. Risk decisions must reflect controls guaranteeingthe minimum risk necessary for safe  obstacle course ma nagement and desired training accomplish-ment. Attachment 6 provides the ORM matrix/considerations for the OCP. Further guidance on howto conduct an ORM can be  found in AFPAM 90-902, Operational Risk Management (ORM) Guid-ance and Tools. 3.3.  Medical Considerations. Airmen have a cardiovascular scre ening annually during their physicalhealth assessment and have an additional screen prior to their AF fitness test. Assuming they pass all com-ponents of their AF fitness test  and have no profile  limiting physical performance, they are cleared tonegotiate the course. The OCPI and OCSO have the authority to pull anyone from the course they feel arenot fit to participate, e.g. physically disabled/injured, unfit, exhausted, or acutely ill and taking medicationthat may interfere with performance etc. NOTE: Standard line of duty dete rmination will apply to ANG  personnel IAW AFI 36-2910, Line ofDuty (Misconduct) Determination. 3.4.  Climate Considerations. Refer to AFPAM 48-151, Thermal Injury (http://www.e-publish-ing.af.mil/pubfiles/af/48/afpam48-151/afpam48-151.pdf) for detailed considerations. 3.4.1.  Hot Temperature. Individuals in hot climates should be given time to become acclimated to thelocal climate prior to attempting to negotiate any category cour se. The level of humidity should alsobe taken into consideration. Th e wet bulb globe temperature inde x (WBGTI) may be used to deter-mine when the course may be used and what precautions are to be taken during training. When usingthe course during hot weather, course officials should be aware of personnel displaying the followingsymptoms: 3.4.1.1.  HEAT CRAMPS – muscle cramps of the abdomen, legs, or arms. 14AFI36-2202   7 AUGUST 20073.4.1.2.  HEAT EXHAUSTION – head ache; excessive sweating; we akness; dizziness; nausea;muscle cramps; and pale, clammy skin. 3.4.1.3.  HEATSTROKE – profuse sw eating; collapse or unconsciou sness that is sudden or pre-ceded by headache, dizziness, fast pulse, nausea, vomiting, and mental confusion. Heat stroke isa medical emergency, call for medical support immediately. 3.4.2.  Cold Temperature. When training on the obstacle course during cold weather, course officialswill ensure the obstacles  are not wet, or icy , and the landing  areas are not frozen. Participants mustwear appropriate hand protection to  prevent cold related injuries  and allow for positive grip. Duringperiods of extreme temperatures, the training period will be kept to the minimum necessary to reducepersonnel exposure to the elements. 3.4.3.  High Altitude. Several factors mu st be considered when training in high altitudes. As the alti-tude increases, blood oxygen leve ls decrease. The resulting lowe red blood oxygen levels can inducecertain problems. Increased heart rate and breathlessness are common. In extreme cases, unconscious-ness can result when the brain is denied oxygen. Additional time should be added to a preconditioningprogram when preparing to complete a course in higher altitude areas. 3.4.4.  Rain. When conducting OCP training in the ra in, check Airmen for hypothermia. Ensure par-ticipants wear proper clothing for the elements  while allowing safe nego tiation of the obstacles.Ensure Airmen wear proper footwear. Conduct a pre-inspection of the course to check for washouts orchanges in the course that would cause potential problems. Conduct ORM to mitigate any newly iden-tified hazards prior to negotiating the course. If id entified hazards cannot be mitigated to an accept-able level, the obstacle will be placed off-limits. 3.5.  General Safety Precautions. OCPMs, OCPIs, OCPSOs, and participants will ensure safety precau-tions are taken to prevent injury  on obstacle courses. Th e following minimum safety requirements mustbe met prior to using the obstacle course: 3.5.1.  Annual and pre-use inspections will be accomplished. At a minimum, inspections will address:each obstacle being used, paths between obstacles, construction, protruding nails, sharp edges, rottenlogs/poles, condition of fall protection and pads, la nding pits and areas, overgrown weeds/vegetationand other hazards. 3.5.2.  Obstacles with safety, design, or construction deficiencies that cannot be corrected prior to startof training will be placed off limits until corrected. These obstacles will be clearly marked as off-lim-its utilizing orange cones and signs on both entry and exit to/from the obstacle. All participants will beadvised which obstacles are of f-limits prior to course negotiation an d pointed out during the coursedemonstration IAW paragraph 2.4.13.4. After major repairs are made to any obstacles a safety inspec-tion must be conducted by  the personnel listed in  Attachment 5 and paragraph 2.4.9.2. above (baseOCPM, base safety office, CES representative) using the checklist found in Attachment 5. 3.5.3.  Rake and refill landing/fall areas under obstacles, as needed, before each use. 3.5.4.  Personnel will conduct warm-up ex ercises as outlined in paragraph  A4.11. before they areallowed on the course. 3.5.5.  Ensure all obstacles have the correct number of properly trained safety personnel present IAWAttachment 5. AFI36-2202   7 AUGUST 2007153.5.6.  Consider postponing  training on the course  when weather conditions may affect footing orhandhold surfaces unless it is mission essential or directed by the commander. 3.5.7.  Ensure medical personnel and equipment are readily available within acceptable response timeto CAT II courses. Medical coverage consists of  trained personnel equipped with emergency lifesav-ing and stabilization equipment and the means to tr ansport injured personnel to appropriate medicalfacilities. 3.5.8.  Ensure a primary and backup means of communication are available and operational. At a min-imum the OCPI must have the ability to summon immediate help by landline, radio or cellular phone. 3.5.9.  Participants should not be allowed to nego tiate obstacle courses if they have donated bloodwithin the previous 72 hours. 3.6.  Negotiating Obstacles. Participants must be instructed in the proper technique for negotiating eachobstacle. The technique to be used must be explained and demonstrated in detail, with emphasis on avoid-ing injury. Alternate methods of obstacle negotiation to those listed in  Attachment 3 may be authorizedas long as they do not increase the safety risk or significantly alter the procedure described. The decisionto negotiate any obstacle is left to the discretion of the participant. 3.7.  Safety Requirements. The following minimum safety require ments must be in place and usedwhenever the obstacle course is in use. OCPI and OCPSO (when required) will be qualified IAW Chap-ter 4 and perform the duties outlined in Chapter 2 of this instruction: 3.7.1.  The OCPIs and OCPSOs must ensure spectators are kept a safe distance away from each obsta-cle and ensure they do not interfere with participant’s progress. 3.7.2.  The OCPI must  have the ability  to summon immediate help by la ndline, radio, or cellularphone for both CAT II courses. 3.7.3.  The obstacle course should not be used during limited visibility unless adequate lighting is pro-vided and an ORM assessment is conducted covering the conditions. Unit commanders should makethis determination balancing the risk to Airmen against realistic training to meet unit mission require-ments. 3.7.4.  No rings, jewelry, watches, or breakable  items will be allowed on the obstacle course. Ringswhich cannot be removed must be  completely taped over to ensure no edges are exposed which maycause a snag hazard. 3.7.5.  All participants will wear appropriate battledress (utility) uniform with the sleeves down. 3.7.6.  Open toed footwear is prohibited. 3.8.  Equipment Requirements. The following are the minimum safe ty equipment requirements for thesafe operation of an obstacle course. Units may need to add to this list to meet unique local requirements. 3.8.1.  OCPI must have a copy of this instruction and OCPM approved safety briefing. 3.8.2.  Radio or telephone communication must be present to summon immediate help. 3.8.3.  First aid kit to treat minor injuries. 3.8.4.  Drinking water must be available. 16AFI36-2202   7 AUGUST 2007Chapter 4  TRAINING AND CURRENCY REQUIREMENTS 4.1.  Readiness. Fitness has a direct impact  on operational readiness. Total readiness includes technical,mental, and physical readiness. Without technical readiness, individuals lack the knowledge and skills toaccomplish their assigned duties. Without mental and physical readiness, there is no confidence or stam-ina to accomplish the mission. NOTE: All recruits entering BMT will meet requirements of AFI 10-248, Para 6.1., and will notattempt the obstacle course prior to the 4th week of training at BMT. This will ensure three fullweeks of supervised PT before negotiating the obstacle course. 4.2.  Instructor and Safety Observer Training. All instructors and safety obser vers will maintain thefollowing minimum training requirements: NOTE: These currency requirements only apply to the minimum number of safety observersrequired by Attachment 3. 4.2.1.

As a minimum this must be maintained in the base/installation ancillarytraining data base and kept on file by the OCPM or designated representative. 18AFI36-2202   7 AUGUST 2007Chapter 5  COURSE LAYOUT, DESIGN AND MAINTENANCE 5.1.  Standardized Course Design. This chapter prescribes the requi rements for the layout, design andmaintenance for AF obstacle courses. 5.2.  Course Layout. Obstacle courses will be laid-out with safety as the primary focus. 5.2.1.  CAT I course layout should take advantage of existing natural obstacles and terrain where pos-sible. Consideration should be given to presence of existing structures, erosion potential, accessibilityand possible hazards such as overhead utilities. 5.2.2.  Possible CAT II course layout is contained in  Attachment 2. At a minimum, consider ationshould be given to fatigue as Airmen negotiate the course with positioning of the most difficult obsta-cles at or near the start. 5.3.  Design. Obstacles should be designed for safe ne gotiation while challenging various physicalaspects of the individual negotiating the course. 5.3.1.  CAT I obstacles are designed for crawling, jumping,  dodging, traversing, climbing, vaultingand balancing. CAT I obstacles will not exceed four  feet in height ( above ground) and will have anORM assessment of negligible IAW AFPAM 90-902. 5.3.2.  CAT II obstacles will not have a potential fall distance above 14 feet without a direct connec-tion to safety lines attended by a qualified, trained safety observer or a full-body-harness with lanyardattached to a supporting structure IA W Association of Challenge Course T echnology or like stan-dards. These obstacles will not  have an ORM assessment above “m oderate” with a residual risk of“negligible” after implementation of counter-measures IAW AFPAM 90-902. 5.3.3.  Attachment 3 contains the list of CA T II obst acles approved for AF obstacle courses.Non-CAT I qualifying obstacles that do not exceed CAT II design criteria, but are not listed in Attach-ment 3, must be approved for use by th e AF OCPM prior to being li sted in a MAJCOM supplementto this instruction. AF  OCPM approved additions  will be added into future  revisions of this AFI.MAJCOM suggested obstacles not included in Attachment 3 will be forwarded to the AF OCPM andinclude the following minimum information: NOTE: Obstacles exceeding CAT II criteria listed in paragraph 1.2.2. are not authorized on AF ObstacleCourses. These obstacles will be place off-limits until removed permanently. 5.3.3.1.  Instructions for negotiating the obstacle. 5.3.3.2.  Number of personnel allowed on the obstacle at one time. 5.3.3.3.  Number of safety personnel required. 5.3.3.4.  ORM assessment with mitigation factors identified. 5.3.3.5.  Special safety considerations or equipment. 5.3.3.6.  Specify type of fall zone protection equipment, if required. 5.3.3.7.  Digital photo (file) of the obstacle. AFI36-2202   7 AUGUST 2007195.3.4.  Obstacle design specifications are contained in the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers’ web page athttp://www.hnd.usace.army.mil/stddgn/StdIndex.aspx?id=13 The following link provides additional information on inspections and fall zone criteria. http://www.tradoc.army.mil/tpubs/pams/p385-1.pdf (Appendix C). 5.4.  OCP Course Inspections. Consider frequency of use and ef fects of the local climate on the  obsta-cles to determine the frequency of inspections  by the OCPM. The OCPM performs course inspectionsusing the Attachment 5 checklist. After repairs to the obstacle  course have been performed, request ajoint safety inspection of the obstacle course with their unit safety monitor, installation safety office, andCES (preferably a Structural Engineer). The results  of this inspection will be filed by the OC PM for thelife of the obstacle. 5.5.  Maintenance. OCP Course(s) maintenance will only be performed by qualified personnel trained toperform structural maintenance. This maintenance may be performed by base civil engineer or by a con-tractor qualified to perform such a task. Self-help maintenance of obstacles is authorized but, the obstaclewill remain off limits until certified by a qualified structural engineer. 5.5.1.  Obstacle Course Records. 5.5.1.1.  Maintenance and inspection  logs. The OCPM will maintain maintenance and inspectionlogs for individual obst acles and for the overall course un der the Records Informat ion Manage-ment System (AFRIMS). As a minimum, the logs will include: 5.5.1.1.1.  A detailed checklist for course and obstacle inspection, see Attachment 5. 5.5.1.1.2.  A record of all insp ections, hazards, deficiencies, and maintenance conducted onthe course. 5.5.1.1.3.  A record of all deficiencies/safety hazards and any actions taken to lessen the unsafecondition. This must be tracked until the problem is completely fixed. Any countermeasures tomitigate risks to personnel must also be listed. 5.6.  Security. The installation commander will work in concert with  the OCPM to develop a securitystrategy protecting the structural integrity of the OCP course(s) and prevent unauthorized use. As a mini-mum, the OCP course will: 5.6.1.  Develop a single point of entry into OCP compound secured with a lockable chain link or solidconstruction fence. Courses that are located within a secure training complex (i.e. USAFA Jacks Val-ley) are exempt from the requirement for individual fences around each course. 5.6.2.  Post “Authorized use only” signs with the OCPM contact information. 5.7.  Funding. OCP funding is a MAJCOM responsibility. 20AFI36-2202   7 AUGUST 20075.8.

Obstacle courses are not playgrounds. The obstacles are difficult and require your full attention.Personnel have been seriously, and in a few instances, fatally injured while attempting an obstacle. To pre-vent occurrences of this nature we must make safety "our primary concern." A4.2.  Remain alert. Personnel on the course are to be constan tly alert for any unsafe acts or conditions(loose bolts, protruding nails, exce ssive splinters, loose or frayed rope s, rotten or split lumber). I f anyunsafe conditions are noted, you must notify an instructor immediately. A4.3.  Participation. Participants are encouraged to attempt al l obstacles, but have the right to declineany obstacle that may be too difficult. A4.4.  Instructor intervention. Instructors will intervene and stop you from completing an obstacle, orthe entire course, if they determine  you are overly fatigued, appear to have  a fear of an obstacle, or a renegotiating an obstacle in an unsafe manner. Do not argue with the instructors if they stop you, they aredoing so in your best interest. A4.5.  Non-interference with obstacle negotiation. No one may attempt to make an obstacle more diffi-cult by shaking ropes, rolling logs, etc., or attempt to humiliate participants into attempting an obstacle. A4.6.  No horseplay on the course. Horseplay or deliberate unsafe act s will not be  tolerated on thecourse. Anyone involved in such activities will immediately be removed from the course and reported totheir commander. A4.7.  Uniform. All personnel should wear BDU/ABU shirts, trousers (with belt), socks, and properlylaced ankle-supporting boots. Additionally, a good pair of gloves is re commended to prevent rope burnswhile running the course. Tight clothing and rubberized or plastic suits are not to be worn. Extra items arenot to be carried or strapped to the body unless approved by the installation commander. A4.8.  Weather assessment. Prior to conducting trai ning, the senior  leader will access Air Forceapproved weather sources for current and forecasted conditions to include wind speed. If it is raining thesenior ranking instructor will make an operational risk management decision on the determination to con-tinue or stop training. A4.9.  Work / rest cycle.
