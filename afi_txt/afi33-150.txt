This  instruction  implements  new  communications  systems/equipment  activity guidelines  and  changes  or  eliminates  the  requirement  to  complete  redundant  procedures  and practices.  Guidance  in  this  publication  is  intended  to  assist  Air  Force  personnel  in  identifying activities  required  to  support  Air  Force  communications.  This  instruction  is  an  initiative  to reduce  the  number  of  SAF/CIO  A6  departmental-  level  publications  by  changing  their publications  from  "stove-piped"  system/program-based  to  audience/role-based  focus.  Specific procedural information is located in the more detailed Methods and Procedures Technical Orders (MPTO)  or  specialized  publications.  Common  core  communication  services  for  standard  user information  (e.g.,  e-mail,  phone,  messaging,  etc.)  are  located  in  AFMAN  33-152,  Users Responsibilities  and  Guidance  for  Information  Systems.  Guidance  for  acquisition  and sustainment planning is located in AFI 63-101, Integrated Life Cycle Management. AFI33-150  30 NOVEMBER 2011   3  1.1.  Objectives.  The  primary  objectives  of  cyberspace  support  activities  are  to  ensure continuous  security,  operational  availability,  and  reliability  of  systems  and  equipment supporting the Air Force mission. This  instruction outlines unit  roles and responsibilities to ensure communications systems/equipment  are serviceable and properly configured to meet mission requirements. 1.2.  Intent.  This instruction mandates the use of MPTO 00-33A-1001, General Cyberspace Support  Activities  Management  Procedures  and  Practice  Requirements,  which  establishes implementation  guidance  and  procedures;  MPTO  00-33D-3003,  Managing  the  Cyberspace Infrastructure  with  the  Cyberspace  Infrastructure  Planning  System,  which  explains  how  to use  the  Cyberspace  Infrastructure  Planning  System  (CIPS)  to  document,  fund,  distribute, implement,  and  manage  the  cyberspace  infrastructure;  and  MPTO  33D-2002,  Engineering, Implementation,  and  Cyberspace  Readiness  Activities  Management,  which  defines  the processes  and  procedures  for  the  management  of  Engineering  Installation  (EI)  and Cyberspace  Readiness  activities  to  include  providing  Major  Commands  (MAJCOMs)  and bases  with  the  necessary  information  to  process  EI  requirements  for  funding  via  the  Air Force (AF) EI Work Plan in CIPS. These elements support the objectives in paragraph 1.1.

All  organizations  owning,  managing,  or  operating  servers  in  any form (data centers as defined by OMB), except for those expressly exempted by paragraph 3.2.1 or paragraph 3.3.1 will work with the SAF/CIO A6 DCC Team (see paragraph 3.4) to ensure these facilities are documented in DCIMS and all obligations are approved IAW the process in paragraph 3. (T-0) 3.  Data Servers And Data Centers Approval Process. 3.1.  AF  Data  Center  Infrastructure  Management.  Under  the  FDCCI,  OMB  defines  a data  center  as  a  closet,  room,  floor  or  building  for  the  storage,  management,  and dissemination of data and information. This definition has been further defined by the DOD CIO  to  include  single  and  multiple  server  instantiations  regardless  of  adherence  to  Uptime Institute  or  TIA-942  standards.    While  it  is  generally  recognized  that  weapon  systems  may not be data centers, most weapon systems have an IT component that may constitute a data center or reside in a data center. Thus, a weapon system designation  , in  and of itself, does not justify an exemption from FDCCI, related data center legislation, DOD guidance, or the guidance contained in this AFI. The SAF/CIO A6 will oversee management and disposition of  all  AF  data  centers  under  the  purview  of  aforementioned  guidance,  to  include  the  data center components of weapons systems. 3.2.  AF Data Center Consolidation.  The DOD CIO, working under the purview of FDCCI guidance, requires all data centers (exceptions are noted below) to be documented in DCIMS.  Records  will  be  created  and  maintained  by  data  center  owners  IAW  guidance  and  training provided by the AF Data Center Consolidation  team  within SAF/CIO A6.  Data center end states (discussed below)  submitted by data center owners will be  adjudicated and  approved by SAF/CIO A6. 3.2.1.  DCIMS  Exemptions.  The  following  items  are  exempt  from  FDCCI  and  do  not require entry into DCIMS: 3.2.1.1.  IT components constituting a data center that are onboard airborne platforms. 3.2.1.2.  IT components constituting a tactical data center such as those contained in shelters. 3.2.1.3.  IT  components  constituting  a  data  center  where  the  metadata  (location, configuration, owner, etc.) is classified. Those systems are inventoried separately by the Director of National Intelligence. AFI33-150  30 NOVEMBER 2011   15  3.2.2.  Data Center End  States.  The following data center  end states  are  defined by the DOD CIO and approved for use in DCIMS: 3.2.2.1.  Core Data Center (CDC) – These locations are selected by the DOD CIO and operated by DISA. 3.2.2.2.  Installation  Processing  Node  (IPN)  –  Data  centers  required  to  host applications  required  for  base  operations  where  access  does  not  transit  the  base boundary.  IPNs will not  allow connections from  one base to  another and there shall be no more than one (1) IPN per base or installation. 3.2.2.3.  Special  Purpose  Processing  Node  (SPPN)  –  Servers  connected  to  special purpose IT or non-IT equipment that cannot be moved due to technical requirements (such as flight simulators) or servers hosting applications critical to Air Force, DOD, or combatant command missions. 3.2.2.4.  Closed  –  Data  centers  not  identified  as  one  of  the  three  categories  above must be projected to close no later than 2018.  Applications hosted within these data centers must be migrated to a data center approved by SAF/CIO A6 as noted below. 3.2.3.  Application  Designations.    Applications  and/or  systems  that  do  not  require  base boundary  transit  for  use  are  designated  local  and  may  reside  in  an  IPN  approved  by SAF/CIO A6.  All other applications and/or systems are designated enterprise and must be  hosted  in  an  enterprise  data  center  approved  by  SAF/CIO  A6  NLT  4th  quarter  of Fiscal  Year  2018  (QTR4FY18).    Exceptions  may  be  granted  by  SAF/CIO  A6  for  those instances where migration to an enterprise location would introduce risk to mission or an approved  business  case  analysis  shows  migration  to  be  cost  prohibited.    Application owners must coordinate with appropriate organizations as directed in Air Force Guidance Memorandum 33-04, Common Computing Environment. 3.2.3.1.  DISA Core Data Center/MilCloud (any app, system, or service). 3.2.3.2.  Commercial  Cloud  (any  app,  system,  or  service)  with  a  DoD  Provisional Authorization for the corresponding data level. 3.2.3.3.  IPNs approved by SAF/CIO A6 (base local apps only). 3.2.3.4.  SPPNs approved by SAF/CIO A6 (SPPN specific apps only). 3.3.  Obligation  of  Funds  Related  to  Data  Centers  (10  USC  §2223a,  Data  Servers  and Centers).

Exemptions  are outlined  below;  however,  data  centers  exempted  under  10  USC  §2223a,  Data  Servers  and Centers must still be documented within the DCIMS, including  IT  components of weapons systems. 3.3.1.  Exemptions to 10 USC §2223a, Data Servers and Centers: 3.3.1.1.  Items acquired using National Intelligence Program (NIP) funds.  This does not include Military Intelligence Program fund. 3.3.1.2.  Items acquired using High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) funds.   16  AFI33-150  30 NOVEMBER 2011 3.3.1.3.  Items within data centers exempted from FDDCI as described in paragraph 3.2.1. 3.3.2.  Items Covered Under 10 USC §2223a, Data Servers and Centers.  This guidance applies  to  obligations  of  any  and  all  funds  to:  construct  or  modify  existing  data  center buildings, facilities, or rooms;  or acquire items  in  the categories listed below regardless of appropriation, requirement, and/or originator. 3.3.2.1.

Data  Servers  and  Centers  Submission  Preparation.  Requests  for  obligation  authority under  10  USC  §2223a,  Data  Servers  and  Centers,  must  support  a  data  center  having  an approved  record  in  the  DCIMS  with  a  valid  DOD  identification  number.  All  data  centers must  also  have  a  corresponding  and  populated  record  in  the  Enterprise  Information Technology  Data  Repository  (EITDR).  All  requests  for  obligation  authority  and  queries,  to include requests for templates or support, must be submitted to the SAF/CIO A6 DCC team via the MAJCOM or FOA A6 to the AF Data Center Consolidation organizational mailbox:  usaf.pentagon.saf-cio-a6.mbx.a3c-a6c-afdcc-workflow@mail.mil. 3.5.  Data Servers and Centers Submission Process. Organizations must submit a spend plan for each data center maintained in DCIMS NLT 31 July of each year. Data centers in DCIMS without an approved spend plan on file with SAF/CIO A6 will be considered noncompliant.  Spend plans must detail individual acquisitions for items listed in  paragraph  3.3.2 planned for the upcoming  year and provide the information  listed below in  paragraphs  3.5.1-3.5.7. Organizations  requiring  acquisition  of  items  not  detailed  on  approved  spend  plans  must submit an out of cycle request for approval to include the items listed below in paragraphs 3.5.1-3.5.7. Spend plans will be approved annually by SAF/CIO A6 to satisfy requirements under the purview of 10 USC §2223a: AFI33-150  30 NOVEMBER 2011   17  3.5.1.

All  spend  plans  against  a  data  center  with  an  end  state  of  “Closed”  must  be accompanied by an approved POAM, which clearly depicts closure before end of FY18. Moreover,  the  acquisitions  for  these  data  centers  must  clearly  depict  actions  to  realize closure. 3.5.7.  A  description  of  efficiencies  realized  including  current  and  project  savings  in dollars or personnel, reduction in required floors space, or reduction in energy usage. 3.6.  Approval  Process  and  Timeline.  The  SAF/CIO  A6  goal  for  completing  review  and granting  approval  or  disapproval  is  10  working  days;  however,  this  can  be  affected  due  to unforeseen  circumstances.  The  “10  day  clock”  starts  when  all  required  inputs  have  been received  and  validated  from  the  requestor.  An  approval  code  assigned  by  SAF/CIOA6  is required  prior  to  execution  of  contracts  or  obligation  of  any  and  all  funds  for  each  item relating to those described in paragraph 3.3.2. Approval codes and associated items will be listed on the Obligation Detail Matrix attached to the SAF/CIO A6 approved spend plan and sent to the requestor. AF DCC at Team 3.6.1.  Out of cycle approval codes may be obtained by sending an electronic message to the usaf.pentagon.saf-cio-a6.mbx.a3c-a6c-afdcc-workflow@mail.mil.  Requests  received  prior  to  1600  EST  will  generally  be  approved the same day with approval codes returned to the requestor.  Requestors must present the validation e-mail provided by SAF/CIO A6 personnel via the “USAF Pentagon SAF-CIO A6  Mailbox  A3C-A6C  AFDCC  Workflow”  electronic  mailbox  along  with  the  out  of cycle  approval  code  for  funds  to  be  obligated  by  a  contracting  officer.  A  SAF/CIO  A6 approval  memorandum  and  attached  Obligation  Detail  Matrix  must  be  provided  for  all obligations relating to items in paragraph 3.3.2, regardless of approval code disposition.   18  AFI33-150  30 NOVEMBER 2011 3.7.

Executive  Agent—Indicates  a  delegation  of  authority  by  a  superior  to  a  subordinate  to  act  on behalf  of  the  superior.  An  agreement  between  equals  does  not  create  an  executive  agent. Designation as executive agent, in and of itself, confers no authority. The exact nature and scope of  the  authority  delegated  must  be  stated  in  the  document  designating  the  executive  agent.  An executive  agent  may  be  limited  to  providing  only  administration  and  support  or  coordinating common  functions  or  it  may  be  delegated  authority,  direction,  and  control  over  specified resources for specified purposes. Flight Commander and Flight Chief—Any officer, enlisted or civilian member fulfilling those duties serving over the flight of personnel.

The  GIG  supports  all DoD,  National  Security,  and  related  Intelligence  Community  missions  and  functions  (strategic, operational, tactical, and business), in war and in peace. The GIG provides capabilities from all operating  locations  (bases,  posts,  camps,  stations,  facilities,  mobile  platforms,  and  deployed sites).  The  GIG  provides  interfaces  to  coalition,  allied,  and  non-DoD  users  and  systems.  It includes  any  system,  equipment,  software,  or  service  that  meets  one  or  more  of  the  following criteria:  transmits  information  to,  receives  information  from,  routes  information  among,  or interchanges  information  among  other  equipment,  software,  and  services;  provides  retention, organization,  visualization,  information  assurance,  or  disposition  of  data,  information,  and/or knowledge  received  from  or  transmitted  to  other  equipment,  software,  and  services;  processes data or information for use by other equipment, software, or services. (10 U.S.C. 2513). Government  Off-The-Shelf  (GOTS)—Equipment,  systems,  and/or  products  that  are  typically developed by the technical staff of the government agency for which it is created. It is sometimes developed  by  an  external  entity,  but  with  funding  and  specification  from  the  agency.  Because agencies  can  directly  control  all  aspects  of  GOTS  products,  these  are  generally  preferred  for government purposes. Hands-on—Any activity involving active participation to include actual performing the task at hand. Joint  Tactical  Radio  System  (JTRS)—A  Defense  Department-wide  initiative  to  develop  a family  of  revolutionary  software-programmable  tactical  radios  that  will  provide  the  warfighter with  voice,  data  and  video  communications,  as  well  as  interoperability  across  the  joint  battle space.  The  JTRS  radios  envisioned  by  DoD,  expected  to  begin  coming  on  line  in  the  2011  or 2012  timeframe,  are  based  on  software  development  that  enables  one  radio  to  handle  various waveforms. IT Lean Process—The Information Technology Lean (IT Lean) process is a tailored version of the  DOD  5000  series  acquisition  process  specifically  designed  for  small  IT  programs,  and applies to systems in acquisition or sustainment including upgrades or modernizations. See AFI 63-101  for  use  of  IT  Lean  in  conjunction  with  the  Security,  Interoperability,  Supportability, Sustainability  and  Usability  (SISSU)  process  using  EITDR  to  manage  the  acquisition  process.
