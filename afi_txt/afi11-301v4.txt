Introduction. Protecting aircrews from harmful lasers is a complex problem involving science,intelligence and medicine in the context of an operational scenario. There are numerous factors that mustbe considered as part of developmental requirements such as: compatibility with different aircraft cockpitdisplays, type mission, head gear, night vision devices, vision correction, device weight, field of view andother human system integration issues. An effective program requires a general understanding of laserthreats, inherent system hazards, and a coordinated interaction between medical, laser safety experts(bioenvironmental engineers or health physicists), intelligence, aircrew and Aircrew Flight Equipmentpersonnel. 1.1.1.  Laser Threat. Aggressive foreign laser development, availability of low cost hazardous com-mercial devices, growing number of our own laser designators, range finders and hand held pointerscontinues to increase the chance of exposure. In 1995, Vienna Protocol IV to the 1980 Conference ofthe States Parties to the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conven-tional Weapons (CCW) was drafted, banning use and transfer of laser weapons whose primary pur-pose is to permanently blind. Although Protocol IV may be viewed as successful in prohibiting useand transfer of a specific category of anti-personnel weapon, we must prepare for inadvertent expo-sure and enemies who may not abide by such protocols. For these reasons, the Air Force approvedAircrew Laser Eye Protection (ALEP) Operational Requirements Document in 1996 to begin formaldevelopment and acquisition programs.  1.1.2.  Laser Hazard. LASER is an acronym for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radi-ation. Lasers produce a coherent intense beam of light and under certain circumstances exposure canresult in damage to the human eye or skin. The human eye is the most vulnerable to injury from lasersin the visible region (400-700nm wavelengths) but are also vulnerable to longer wavelengths of invis-ible lasers in the near infrared region (700-1100nm) and shorter wavelengths in the ultra-violet region.Lasers can cause eye injuries at ranges up to several miles and incur a "dazzling" effect at even greaterdistances, particularly at night. Reflection within the cockpit when using a hand held laser pointer alsopresents a hazard to aircrew.  1.1.2.1.  Lasers damage human eyes at ranges up to several miles and cause a "dazzling" effect ateven greater distances (particularly at night). Dazzling occurs when Lasers interact with cockpitillumination and scatter light resulting in the inability of aircrew to perform their mission.  1.1.2.2.  Reflective energy released from a hand held Laser pointer in an aircraft cockpit presentsa potential hazard to aircrew not wearing appropriate Laser eye protection. 1.2.  Acquisition Strategy. Headquarters Air Combat Command (ACC) is the lead command for acquisi-tion of aircrew laser eye protection. ACC/A8SR tasked MAJCOM Aircrew Flight Equipment functionalmanagers to report command requirements for ALEP devices. Aggregate requirements are establishedand requisitions are programmed to fill unit demands. The acquisition strategy for ALEP is the evolution-ary acquisition approach. In this process, a desired capability is identified and threshold objectives arerefined through controlled technological demonstrations and risk management with continuous user feed-back. Each increment of development provides the user an improved capability. Requirements for futureAFI11-301V4   21 FEBRUARY 20083increments depend on user feedback, threat assessments and technological maturity. The approvingauthority for use of all aircrew laser eye protective devices is referenced in AFOSH STD 48-139. 1.3.  Information/Asset Security. Information disclosing specific characteristics of laser protectivedevices is classified IAW provisions of the Aircrew Laser Eye Protection Security Classification Guide(77AESG/YACL, 7909 Lindbergh Dr., Brooks AFB, TX 78235-5352, telephone COM (210) 536-5464 orDSN 240-5464). Request for information defining specific characteristics of laser protective devicesshould be directed to Headquarters Air Combat Command, Flight Operations and Training Branch (ACC/A3TO), Langley AFB Virginia. 1.4.  Disposition of Protective Devices. Laser eye protective devices should be secured to prevent pilfer-age. Units having condemned or otherwise unserviceable spectacles will maintain positive control storingassets until they are physically destroyed or returned to Standard Base Supply System (SBSS).  1.4.1.  Destruction of ALEP. The preferred method of disposal for all ALEP is to incinerate the lenses.AFE personnel should crush lenses and hand carry debris to Intel, (or follow specific installation burnprocedures as applicable) for burn. Intel has the capability of burning spectacles in a burn bag.  1.5.  Responsibilities:  1.5.1.  MAJCOM.  1.5.1.1.  Will develop a Laser Eye Protection Training course that educates aircrew on the properwear and protection capabilities of each available device.  1.5.2.  Laser Safety Officer (LSO). ANSI Z136.1 specifies any facility using Class 3b or Class 4 lasersor laser systems to designate a Laser Safety Officer to oversee safety for all operational, maintenanceand servicing units.  1.5.2.1.  Is responsible for establishing a squadron Laser safety training program and ensuring allpersonnel using hand held Lasers or have a requirement to wear ALEP receive Laser AwarenessTraining. 1.5.2.2.  Will train unit personnel on hazards surrounding an active Laser and appropriate safetyequipment available for use when working around or handling an active Laser. 1.5.2.3.  In an environment where exposure is possible, LSO duties and responsibilities may beassumed by the Aircrew Flight Equipment Officer (FEO).  1.5.2.4.  Consult AFOSH STD 48-139 for further information on LSO duties and responsibilities. 1.5.3.  Aircrew Flight Equipment. Aircrew flight Equipment will fit, inspect, maintain and train air-crew on proper use of laser protective devices defined in this instruction. 1.5.4.  Aerospace Medicine. 1.5.4.1.  Local flight surgeons, in concert with Optometrists, Ophthalmologists, Physiologists and/or Bioenvironmental Engineers will ensure aircrew members are familiar with different effectslasers have on the eye.  1.5.4.2.  Flight surgeons will perform laser eye examinations for aircrew as outlined in AFOSHSTD 48-139.  4AFI11-301V4   21 FEBRUARY 20081.5.4.3.  Optometrists will ensure refractive ALEP devices, when available, meet individual cor-rective vision specifications and are properly fitted. 1.5.5.  Intelligence. Unit intelligence agencies will ensure aircrew is briefed on potential laser threattypes and locations. Additionally, intelligence personnel will ensure aircrew receive current threatassessment data during mission profile briefings. 1.5.5.1.  Will ensure adequate procedures are in place to capture and promptly disseminatereported incidents of Laser exposure involving aircrew.  1.5.6.  Air Force Safety Center (AFSC). AFSC, as chairs of the AF Laser System Safety ReviewBoard (LSSRB), reviews CONOPS, TTPs for operational laser devices and associated use of ALEP,providing guidance as necessary. ALEP use is part of the LSSRB review process ultimately leading toAF Safety certification for lasers, as required by AFOSH-STD 48-139.  AFI11-301V4   21 FEBRUARY 20085Chapter 2  OPERATIONS 2.1.  Operational Use of ALEP. ALEP should be worn when there is any risk of a laser exposure. AFI14-105 ACC Sup1 gives A2 the responsibility to brief aircrew on relevant laser incidents so aircrew canplan accordingly. Based on the threat environment, local commanders have discretionary control overALEP wear policy for their subordinates. When ALEP is worn together with NVGs, aircrews are advisedto perform a preflight and sight adjustment wearing both. This preflight/adjustment will ensure anychanges to visual acuity are identified before flight.  2.2.  Medical Examination. A medical eye examination is required for personnel who routinely work ina laser hazardous environment. Aircrew who operate in an environment where they could be exposed toany laser are required to get a prescreening eye examination. This examination will document the condi-tion of the eye before working in the Laser hazardous environment. A comparative examination will beconducted upon termination of duties. 2.3.  Selecting Appropriate Laser Eye Protection. Laser eye protection is designed to protect aircrewfrom specific laser irradiation transmitted at visible and invisible wavelengths. Incorrect usage or subject-ing laser protective devices to conditions outside specific design capabilities will result in a degradationof performance and potential risk of exposure to harmful laser energy. When selecting an ALEP deviceconsider the following criteria: 2.3.1.  Laser Threat. Unit intelligence personnel should provide aircrew information on known laserthreats in the current theater of operation. Aircrew should then pass that information to AFE whoin-turn will select a Laser protective device capable of countering the threat. 2.3.2.  Types of ALEP. Aircrew Flight Equipment personnel should provide aircrew information onthe protective characteristics of ALEP available for use. Specific wavelength protection offered byeach device is classified and available upon request from ACC/A3TO, DSN 574-3063. Information isalso at A3TO and A3TV web pages at: https://a3.acc.af.mil/dot/index.asp. Further informationabout ALEP is available at the Eye Protection Task Force SIPRNET site at http://www.a3a5.hq.af.smil.mil/a5r/a5re/docs/eyeprotection.htm.  2.3.3.  Side Protection. Some Laser protective devices are available with and without side protection.ALEP with side protection is required when employing hand held laser pointers in the aircraft to pre-vent exposure to reflective energy. Side protection should also be employed when wearing NVGs.Although NVGs provide a level of laser eye protection from exposures along the axis of the eye, with-out the proper side protection given by the approved ALEP, there is a chance of incurring an off-axisexposure.  2.4.  Suspected Laser Exposure. If exposed to a laser, the aircraft commander will ensure appropriatecommand and control, intelligence, safety and medical agencies are notified as soon as possible. Aircrewwho suspect exposure to laser radiation from either friendly or hostile sources should report to the FlightSurgeon’s Office (FSO) or nearest emergency room where individual can be examined by an ophthalmol-ogist immediately upon landing. The FSO will manage and coordinate the event with MAJCOM, USAF-SAM/AFC, 77th AESG/YA and AFRL as directed by AFOSH STD 48-139. More information about6AFI11-301V4   21 FEBRUARY 2008historical incidents and exposure reporting procedures is available on the SIPRNET at:http:\www.naic.wrightpatterson.af.smil.mil/DEW/LE/index.html.  2.4.1.  If exposure comes from a friendly source, the mishap should also be reported through appropri-ate safety channels, and if required, documented in the Air Force Safety Automation System. ConsultAFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports, for further guidance. 2.5.  Initial Response. When encountering laser illumination, aircrew should not stare at the laser source,but transition to aircraft instruments and turn away from the threat. Aircrews should recognize the lasermay be associated with a weapon posing a greater threat and initiate appropriate evasive action. If a laserthreat exists in vicinity of an airfield of intended arrival or departure, ALEP devices should be donnedprior to descent from cruise altitude, or prior to takeoff, as applicable. Doffing of ALEP devices afterdeparting a defined laser threat area or after landing is left to discretion of the aircraft commander. Thefollowing procedures should be implemented immediately following suspected laser exposure. 2.5.1.  Look away from laser source; do not remove night vision goggles. 2.5.2.  Transition to aircraft instruments. 2.5.3.  In a multi-seat aircraft, if exposed pilot is flying the aircraft, transfer control to unaffected pilot. 2.5.4.  Assess visual functionality. If visual disturbance persists for more than 60 seconds, declarein-flight emergency and return to base as soon as practical.  2.5.5.  Notify command and control agency of suspected laser incident. 2.5.6.  Avoid rubbing eyes. 2.5.7.  If vision returns to normal and there is no pain within 3-5 minutes, the Aircraft Commander(AC) will consider the value of continuing the mission against potential loss of a aircrew member whomay have sustained eye damage. The AC will determine whether or not to return to base.  2.5.8.  Upon return to base, accomplish intelligence debrief and report suspected laser exposure inci-dents IAW procedures at: http:\www.naic.wrightpatterson.af.smil.mil/DEW/LE/index.html. 2.5.9.  Aircrew who suspect exposure to laser radiation from either friendly or hostile sources shouldreport to Flight Surgeon’s Office (FSO) or nearest emergency room where they can be examined by anophthalmologist immediately upon landing.

General Laser Awareness Training is required for all aircrewas part of Initial Physiological Training. Specific training is required for aircrew using hand held Lasers oroperating in an environment where ALEP will worn. Aircrew Flight Equipment personnel maintainingLaser pointers or assigned to an AFE shop maintaining Laser pointers are required to receive GeneralLaser Awareness Training and specific training on relevant equipment within their control.  3.2.  Training Curriculum. The LSO will conduct General Laser Awareness Training. Aircrew FlightEquipment will train aircrew on the different types of ALEP available for use against a Laser hazard orthreat and limitations of ALEP maintained. ALEP training is the collective responsibility of the LaserSafety Officer, Aircrew Flight Equipment, Intelligence and Aerospace Medical personnel. Trainingshould be conducted upon assignment to laser duties with refresher training accomplished annually usingMAJCOM approved academics (AFOSH STD 48-139). 3.3.  Initial Training. Initial training will be completed by each aircrew member prior to use of anyALEP device. Specific training requirements are defined in attachment 2, Training Syllabus and Instruc-tor Guide. Units should expand this guide to include unit specific safety training requirements. Trainingshould also cover specific AFE equipment integration issues interfering with proper wear of laser eye pro-tection. Initial training is conducted before an individual is allowed to handle a Laser pointer.  3.4.  Refresher Training. ALEP refresher training is accomplished annually and may be combined withAFE equipment event training (LL06). Refresher training may be abbreviated where necessary to focusattention on equipment configuration changes and/or implementation procedures changed during the year. 3.5.  Training Documentation. Documentation of training should be consistent with good records keep-ing, and training events should be recorded in Automated Records Management System (ARMS) or othercurrency tracking systems. 3.6.  Instructor Training Certification. Wing/Unit designated personnel will conduct initial and annualrefresher training. A qualified wing or squadron level AFE instructor as defined in AFI 11-301V1, withassistance of representatives from appropriate support agencies listed in Chapter 1 of this instruction willprovide training on the functions, characteristics, capabilities and limitations of unit assigned ALEP. TheMaster Lesson Plan is maintained on the 361 TRS/TRR CoP at https://wwwd.my.af.mil/afknprod/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?Filter=AE-OP-00-01. Wings are expected to supplement the Master LessonPlan as necessary to incorporate known threat related data. The ALEP Instructor Guide will be reviewedand approved annually by ACC/A3TOA Aircrew Flight Equipment . Air National Guard units shouldroute changes through ANG/A3OS. Be aware Instructor Guides containing sensitive information willrequire a comparable security level control. 8AFI11-301V4   21 FEBRUARY 2008Chapter 4  DESCRIPTION, FITTING, INSPECTION AND MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES FOR ALEP DEVICES 4.1.

Aircrew Flight Equipmentpersonnel are responsible for fitting, periodic inspection and routine maintenance of aircrew laser eye pro-tective devices. When not in use, Laser protective devices will be securely stored to prevent theft, damageor unwarranted misuse. 4.2.  Glendale FV-9 Santa Cruz Spectacle.  4.2.1.  Item Description. The Glendale FV-9 Santa Cruz spectacle consist of a monolithic polycar-bonate lens formed through an injection molding process and incorporates an absorptive dye that isdesigned to absorb laser emissions in near infrared energy spectral region. The FV-9 will protect thewearer from Laser energy emitted from Air Commander’s Pointer. For more specific information onwavelength specifications contact ACC/A3TOA Command Aircrew Flight Equipment section.  4.2.2.  Capability. The FV-9 transmits 50% of visible light and will protect wearer from Laser energyemitted from militarily significant infrared designators and pointers operating in infrared spectralregion. The FV-9 is compatible with NVGs and Heads-Up-Displays. The FV-9 spectacles provide sideprotection in a wraparound frame design and are authorized for use with handheld lasers. 4.2.3.  Warnings and Limitations. FV-9 ALEP devices are designed to protect against specific laserenergy wavelength in the non-visible region. Incorrect usage or subjecting spectacles to conditionsoutside certified specifications may result in a degradation of performance and potential risk of expos-ing the user to a laser hazard/threat. Never use ALEP to intentionally view a laser. 4.2.4.  Fitting. FV-9 spectacles are designed with adjustable temple pieces to allow spectacles to fitclose to the face. Expand or contract temple pieces to obtain a close comfortable fit. 4.2.5.  Pre-Use Inspection and Maintenance. Inspect ALEP spectacles for visible lens scratches orframe damage. Always store the spectacles in the provided protective case when not in use.  4.2.6.  Periodic Inspection and Maintenance. The following inspection requirements are providedto extend serviceability of FV-9 spectacles and will be accomplished by AFE personnel every 180days. Document inspection in Aircrew Life Support Management System (ALSMS) or otherapproved electronic tracking system.  4.2.6.1.  Visually inspect lenses for scratches and remove from service spectacles displayingscratches in the primary focal region. Surface scratches remove absorptive dyes and reduce opticaldensity. Replacement assets are available through base supply under Federal Stock Number4240-01-458-5567. 4.2.6.2.  Visually inspect to ensure lenses are secure in the frame. Any sign of frame damage isreason to remove spectacles from service. 4.2.6.3.  Clean lenses using cloth and plastic lens cleaner supplied with the spectacles. AFI11-301V4   21 FEBRUARY 20084.3.  Block Zero (CLEPIR ) Spectacle.  94.3.1.  Item Description. Block 0 spectacles are designed to fit in the Air Force Frame and were pro-cured as a COTS item. The spectacle is composed of a thin film containing the laser protective prop-erties bonded between two polycarbonate elements laminated together to form a lens. The lenses arethen glazed into the Air Force Frame and temple arm is etched with a serial number. Each spectaclelens is custom fitted to the frame and is not interchangeable. 4.3.2.  Capability. Block 0 spectacles provide laser protection by reflecting a percentage of incidentradiation. The spectacle can minimize temporary effects of dazzle or glare and prevent permanent eyedamage from low power lasers in selected visible and invisible spectral regions. Block 0 spectaclesare optimized for night operations and may be prone to exhibit signs of reflection or glare when wornduring daylight hours. Attachable side shield protection is available for use with Block 0 spectaclesfrom Glendale Technologies. Specific wavelength characteristics of this device are available uponrequest from ACC/A3TOA, Langley AFB VA.  4.3.3.  Warnings and Limitations. ALEP devices are designed to protect against specific laserenergy wavelengths. Therefore, incorrect usage or subjecting the spectacles to conditions outside cer-tified specifications may result in a degradation of performance and potential risk of exposing the userto a laser hazard/threat. The Aerospace Systems Group, 77 AESG/YA has certified Block 0 spectaclessafe for flight during day and night operations. Subsequently, any pair of spectacles viewed as exces-sively reflective should be annotated and removed from service. 4.3.4.  Fitting. Spectacles should be properly fitted prior to use in a laser hazard/threat area. Theyshould fit as close to the face as possible maximizing the area of protection. There should be minimalgaps between the frame and side of the nose. Temple’s arms should press lightly against side of thehead, and earpieces should curve downward following the back of ear to prevent spectacle from slid-ing out of position. 4.3.5.  Pre-Use Inspection and Maintenance.  4.3.5.1.  Check spectacle frame for signs of damage. 4.3.5.2.  Check to ensure lenses are secure in the frame. 4.3.5.3.  Store spectacles in micro fiber cloth bag and hard carrying case when not in use. Basicinformation on use, storage and cleaning is included in the hard carrying case.  4.3.5.4.  Remove dust on optical lens surface with the cleaning bag provided. Ensure cleaning bagis itself clean prior to use. The cloth bag can be cleaned as necessary by hand or machine-washedin water temperatures up to 140°F.  4.3.5.5.  Remove mud or grit from lens surface with clean water. Dirt and grime should beremoved using a water moistened lens tissue taking care not to trap abrasive matter between thetissue and polycarbonate surfaces. Soap or a mild detergent similar to Ivory Liquid should be usedto remove greasy stains or smears. Do not use petroleum spirit or other solvents to clean specta-cles. Dry the optical surfaces using a clean dry lens tissue. 4.3.6.  Periodic Inspection and Maintenance.  4.3.6.1.  Aircrew Flight Equipment personnel will inspect Block 0 spectacles for serviceabilityupon receipt and every 180 days thereafter. Document inspection in ALSMS or other approvedelectronic tracking system.  10AFI11-301V4   21 FEBRUARY 20084.3.6.2.  Inspect lenses for signs of delamination. Delamination can be verified by carefully look-ing through the spectacle lenses from a distance of approximately 12 inches. Delamination willlook like growth rings on a tree cross-section, a series of partial rings or slight color differencesfrom rest of the lens. Delamination usually starts in the corners of the lens. Except in extremecases, delamination does not diminish laser protection properties. Do not use if either lens showssigns of delamination between front and rear polycarbonate that affects aircrew vision or exceeds4mm in any direction. 4.3.6.3.  Visually inspect and ensure individual lenses are secure in frame. If the frame is damaged,lenses cannot be recovered for further use because lenses are custom matched to each frame. 4.3.6.4.  Remove from service spectacles displaying scratches in primary focal region. Lenses arecoated with an anti-reflective coating that does not impact performance of the laser protectiveproperties when scratched. However, scratches may be distracting when appearing in the primaryfocal region and should be removed from service.  4.4.  Block Zero Plus Spectacle (Model B) and Clip-on (Model D)  4.4.1.  Item Description. Block 0+ laser protective devices were procured as COTS items in FY02and were available in two configurations; an Air Force Frame spectacle and a clip-on device. Thespectacle and clip-on have two lenses constructed of a polycarbonate optical element. There is a poly-carbonate element on the outer surface and a polycarbonate optical element on the inner surface. Athin film containing laser protective properties is bonded between polycarbonate elements and lami-nated together to form the lenses. Lenses are glazed into frame and etched with a serial number. Eachspectacle lens is custom fitted to the frame and is not interchangeable. 4.4.2.  Capability. Block 0+ ALEP devices provide laser protection by reflecting and absorbing a per-centage of incident radiation. This device can minimize temporary effects of dazzle or glare and pre-vent permanent eye damage from lasers in selected visible and invisible spectral regions. Housed inAir Force Frame, Block 0+ ALEP extends capability of Block 0 by adding additional bands of protec-tion. Also, Block 0+ ALEP is provided as a clip-on for aviators who wear prescription spectacles.Clip-on spectacles are attachable to standard medium size 55mm Air Force Frame. For additionalinformation on protective characteristics of this device, contact HQ ACC/A3TOA, Langley AFB VA. 4.4.3.  Warnings and Limitations. Block 0+ ALEP added protection beyond Block 0 and are certi-fied safe for flight. Wearing Block 0+ may result in a slight change in appearance of some colors.However, any pair of spectacles observed to promote excessive reflection or color shifts should beannotated and removed from service. Spectacles should not be exposed to temperatures below - 4°F orabove 131°F.  4.4.4.  Fitting. Block 0+ spectacles should be fitted using the following procedures.  4.4.4.1.  Fit spectacles as close to face as possible with minimal gaps between the frame and sideof the nose. The nose pads can be adjusted with needle nose pliers to minimize gaps, reduceentrance of stray radiation and improve comfort. The temple arms should press lightly against sideof the head and earpieces should curve downward following back of the ear to prevent spectaclesfrom sliding out of position. 4.4.4.2.  Block 0+ Clip-On (Model D) is designed to attach to outer surface of the new AFF (a.k.a.IAS) aircrew spectacle 55mm frame. Clip-on attachment hooks should tightly "grasp" spectacleAFI11-301V4   21 FEBRUARY 200811frame. Do not attempt to attach the clip-on to older style aircrew frame. Doing so will damageclip-on and create a FOD hazard. 4.4.4.3.  Users requiring prescription capability have two options available. 4.4.4.3.1.  Option 1: A combination of contact lens and the Model B spectacle. 4.4.4.3.2.  Option 2: A combination of aircrew prescription spectacles and Model D clip-on.While this option provides the required capability, it adds additional weight to spectacle, cre-ates additional reflections and some loss of visual acuity. 4.4.5.  Pre-Use Inspection and Maintenance.  4.4.5.1.  Check spectacle frame for signs of damage. 4.4.5.2.  Check to ensure lenses are secure in the frame. 4.4.5.3.  Store spectacles in micro fiber cloth bag and hard carrying case when not in use. Basicinformation on use, storage and cleaning is included in hard carrying case.  4.4.5.4.  Remove dust on the optical lens surface with cleaning bag provided. Ensure cleaning bagis itself clean prior to use. The cloth bag can be cleaned as necessary by hand or machine-washedin water temperatures up to 140°F.  4.4.5.5.  Remove mud or grit from lens surface with clean water. Dirt and grime should beremoved using a water moistened lens tissue taking care not to trap abrasive matter between thetissue and polycarbonate surfaces. Soap or a mild detergent similar to Ivory Liquid should be usedto remove greasy stains or smears. Do not use petroleum spirit or other solvents to clean specta-cles. Dry the optical surfaces using a clean dry lens tissue. 4.4.6.  Periodic Inspection and Maintenance.  4.4.6.1.  Aircrew Flight Equipment personnel will inspect Block 0+ spectacle/Clip-on for service-ability upon receipt and every 180 days thereafter. Document inspection in ALSMS or otherapproved electronic tracking system.  4.4.6.2.  Inspect lenses for signs of delamination. Delamination can be verified by carefully look-ing through spectacle lenses from a distance of approximately 12 inches. Delamination will looklike growth rings on a tree cross-section, a series of partial rings or slight color differences fromrest of the lens. Delamination usually starts in the corners of the lens. Except in extreme cases,delamination does not diminish laser protection properties. Do not use if either lens show signs ofdelamination between front and rear polycarbonate that affects aircrew vision or exceeds 4mm inany direction. 4.4.6.3.  Visually inspect and ensure individual lenses are secure in the frame. If the frame is dam-aged, lenses cannot be recovered for further use because lenses are custom matched to each frame. 4.4.6.4.  Lenses are coated with an anti-reflective coating that does not impact performance oflaser protective properties when scratched. However, scratches may be distracting when appearingin the primary focal region and may require removed from service. 4.5.  Block One Spectacle.  4.5.1.  Item Description. The spectacles consist of a TR-90 nylon front frame, TR-90 nylon templepieces, a metal nosepad assembly with cushioned nosepads and polycarbonate laser protective lenses.12AFI11-301V4   21 FEBRUARY 2008Eight stainless steel screws secure all parts. In addition, the lenses are secured with a silicone adhe-sive. Three frame sizes are available to allow correct fitting for different users. The three sizes vary intheir interpupilary distance (IPD). IPD is the distance between the centers of the user’s pupils, and ismeasured in millimeters. The three frame sizes available are 57 mm (small), 63 mm (medium) and 69mm (large). These three sizes allow a +/- 4 mm IPD variation.  4.5.2.  Capability. Block 1 spectacles will minimize temporary effects (e.g., dazzle or glare) and per-manent eye damage from lasers in selected wavelengths in the visible, Ultraviolet (UV) and NearInfrared (NIR) regions. Spectacle design provides wide-angle protection against off-axis laser threatsand accommodates aviators with and without prescription spectacles. Block 1 spectacles are compati-ble with all AFE equipment with exception of the Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System and NVGs.  4.5.3.  Warnings and Limitations. Wearing Block 1 ALEP may cause some difficulty in determiningthe actual color of runway/tower lighting. Green runway threshold/tower lights may appear yellowwhile white lights may pink. Aircrew should receive specific training unique to Block 1 to ensure theycan identify runway/tower lighting patterns while wearing the device. Block 1 spectacles are notapproved for use with NVGs. 4.5.4.  Fitting. Block 1 spectacles must be precisely fitted to user. The technology used to providewavelength protection is highly “eye centered”. If device is not properly fitted when worn, the usermay lose some wavelength protection, may not be able to view some instrument displays or mayexperience some loss of visual acuity. Issuing this device to persons other than the fitted user is highlydiscouraged. Specific fitting instructions are contained in Block 1 technical manual 14P3-9-51. 4.5.5.  Pre-Use Inspection and Maintenance. Consult specific Block 1 technical manual for pre-useinspection and maintenance procedures. 4.5.6.  Periodic Inspection and Maintenance.  4.5.6.1.  Aircrew Flight Equipment personnel will inspect Block 1 for serviceability upon receiptand every 180 days thereafter. Document inspection in ALSMS or other approved electronictracking system.  4.5.6.2.  Inspect lenses for signs of delamination. Delamination can be verified by carefully look-ing through spectacle lenses from a distance of approximately 12 inches. Delamination will looklike growth rings on a tree cross-section, a series of partial rings or slight color differences fromrest of the lens. Delamination usually starts in the corners of the lens. Except in extreme cases,delamination does not diminish laser protection properties. Do not use if either lens show signs ofdelamination between front and rear polycarbonate that affects aircrew vision or exceeds 4mm inany direction. 4.5.6.3.  Refer to 14P4-5-91 for additional inspection criteria. 4.6.  JCAS (JHMCS Compatible ALEP Spectacles)  4.6.1.  Item Description. The JCAS design is a rapid response effort to provide laser protection forJHMCS users. The required laser protection is contained within a laminated polycarbonate lens struc-ture. The JCAS lenses are housed in the Low Pro Wrap frame providing a one-size-fits-all configura-tion. Each spectacle is marked with a serial number and identification code on the frame. JCAS isvisually compatible with JHMCS (Joint Helmeted Mounted Cueing System) display and designed towork with the 40% JHMCS visor. Required design trades eliminated prescription capability andAFI11-301V4   21 FEBRUARY 200813reduced field of regard coverage (compared to Block 1) to accommodate fit in limited space behindthe JHMCS visor. 4.6.2.  Capability. JCAS spectacles implement technologies that reflect or absorb specific laserwavelengths. JCAS will minimize temporary effects (e.g., dazzle or glare) and permanent eye damagefrom lasers of selected wavelengths in UV, visible, and NIR. JCAS does not provide vision correctionfor prescription wearers and is not designed for night use. JCAS spectacles are optimized for day usewith 40% JHMCS visor and are fit compatible with JHMCS helmet/visor/mask system. 4.6.3.  Warnings and Limitations. Wearing JCAS may cause some difficulty in determining actualcolor of lighting and may cause some color shifts. Aircrew should receive specific training unique toJCAS to ensure they can identify lighting patterns and color shifts while wearing the device. JCASspectacles are day-only devices optimized for performance and protection with 40% JHMCS visor.JCAS is not intended for night use. Always store JCAS in the protective case to prevent unnecessarysolarization of the lenses. 4.6.4.  Fitting. JCAS is provided in one size to fit all users. AFE Technicians fit JCAS to pilots byadjusting temple arms and nose pads to accommodate oxygen mask and JHMCS visor while provid-ing optimal lens coverage over each eye. Spectacles must be properly fitted prior to use in a laser haz-ard/threat area. Specific fitting instructions are contained in the JCAS Technical Manual. 4.6.5.  Pre-Use Inspection and Maintenance. Inspect JCAS spectacles for visible lens scratches orframe damage. Use only the cleaning cloth/bag provided or high quality lens tissue for wiping thelens. Always store spectacles in protective case when not in use. Consult JCAS Technical Manual forspecific pre-use inspection and maintenance procedures. 4.6.6.  Periodic Inspection and Maintenance.  4.6.6.1.  Aircrew Flight Equipment personnel will inspect JCAS spectacles for serviceability uponreceipt and every 180 days thereafter. Document inspection in ALSMS or other approved elec-tronic tracking system. The JCAS frame and lenses will be inspected for damage or defects.  4.6.6.2.  Inspect lenses for signs of delamination. Delamination can be verified by carefully look-ing through spectacle lenses from a distance of approximately 12 inches. Delamination will looklike growth rings on a tree cross-section, a series of partial rings or slight color differences fromrest of the lens. Delamination usually starts in the corners of the lens. Except in extreme cases,delamination does not diminish laser protection properties. Do not use if either lens show signs ofdelamination between front and rear polycarbonate that affects aircrew vision or exceeds 4mm inany direction. 4.6.6.3.  Refer to JCAS technical manual for additional inspection criteria. 4.7.  Forms Adopted.
