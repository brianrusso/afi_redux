General. Those who use this instruction should bear in mind that an infinite number of variations areavailable and that the cargo compartment configurations listed here are the most typical encounteredday-to-day. If deviations are required during contingency operations, use sound judgement and opera-tional risk management to meet mission demands. In order to meet HQ AF guidance towards conservingfuel, additional equipment not normally used in day-to-day operations should be removed. 1.2.  Responsibilities. Personnel engaged in planning operations must consider the most appropriate con-figuration that will satisfy mission requirements and permit minimum variations and man-hours tochange. Units performing services on the HC/MC-130 aircraft (e.g., maintenance, life support) areresponsible for configuring the aircraft in accordance with (IAW) this instruction and as outlined in mis-sion directives to include the stowage/installation of equipment IAW the configuration and equipmenttables outlined herein.  1.3.  Configuration Codes. Use the following codes when referring to HC/MC-130 cargo compartmentconfigurations. The number identifying the configuration capability will follow the letter code. 1.3.1.  AE - Aeromedical Evacuation 1.3.2.  C - Cargo 1.3.3.  CP - Cargo and Passengers 1.3.4.  LP - PSYOPS 1.3.5.  P - Passenger 1.3.6.  RAPID – Term synonymous with infiltration/exfiltration (Infil/Exfil) 1.3.7.  TAC - Tactical Airdrop Cargo 1.3.8.  TAP - Tactical Airdrop Personnel 1.4.  Modifications. The configuration codes of this instruction may require modification for a specificmission. Each modification must be carefully evaluated prior to mission operation to ensure maximumflight safety and compatibility with aircraft equipment. Each mission directive will identify the basic con-figuration by code and the modification, if necessary, to satisfy the mission requirement. For example, acargo mission may require additional seats or equipment such as a bulldog winch not in the C-X cargoconfiguration. Indicate the mission directive configuration C-X (number as applicable) and modification,e.g., two additional seats and bulldog winch required. 1.5.  Weight and Balance.  1.5.1.  Configuration and necessary equipment changes to conduct rescue missions affect the weightand balance of the aircraft. To standardize equipment and the location of the equipment, items shownin Table 2.1. will be included in the basic weight of the aircraft and remain on the aircraft except formaintenance, inspection and when removal is directed by this AFI. Equipment listed in Table 2.2. willbe added as necessary and entered on DD Form 365-4, Weight and Balance Clearance Form F, at ref-6AFI11-2HC-130V3_ADDENDA-A   15 APRIL 2008erence 6, 7, or 8. Adjustments will be made when the actual on board weight of these items vary fromthe data shown. Add aircraft armor into the DD Form 365-4 (Form F) if armor is installed on the air-craft. Paratroop door armor, and panels covering components requiring access in flight (if required),needs to be re-calculated when armor is repositioned. DD Form 365-4 will be completed IAW instruc-tions in Chapter 5. 1.5.2.  When a configuration change that removes items listed in Table 2.1. is accomplished at a For-ward Operating Location (FOL) and no Quality Assurance Branch (QA) weight and balance authorityis deployed to the location, maintenance personnel will put an info note in the AFTO Form 781A,Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document indicating the weight, fuselage station and moment ofany equipment added or removed. The loadmaster will add or subtract the listed weight and momentfrom the last entry in the DD Form 365-3, Chart C, Basic Weight and Balance Record. Annotate thenew weight and moment in Block 1 of DD 365-4. Configuration changes accomplished at home sta-tion require a QA update to the DD Form 365-3, Chart C. EXCEPTION: Minor equipment changesafter crew reporting may be annotated on the DD 365-4, by the loadmaster. NOTE: Operations Group Stan/Eval assisted by Quality Assurance will develop a list of the itemsremoved when configuring the aircraft for RAPID 1, 2, and 3. Stan/Eval will provide what items will beremoved and Quality Assurance will provide the weight, fuselage station, and moment for each item. Filethe list behind the DD Form 365-3 Chart C.

This chapter contains basic cargo compartment configurations for the HC/MC-130PAircraft. Although modifications to the basic configuration are authorized to meet special requirements,the following factors should be considered: WARNING: Jettison of pallets from the aircraft rollers without dual rails has not been tested and shouldbe attempted only as a last resort.  NOTES:For aircraft with personnel equipment storage bins installed, useable cargo space is limited to 69 inchesoff the cargo floor from FS 417 to FS 617, extending 35 inches inboard from the wheel well that the binsare attached to. All cargo compartment configurations depict the rescue bin installed. Installation and use of the rescuebin is at the discretion of the flying unit CC or DO. Standard configuration for contingency deployments is with at least one fuselage tank installed.  3.1.1.  Sidewall and wheel-well seats should be installed/stowed on all missions unless otherwisedepicted by this instruction. One-man sidewall seats will not be used unless connected to a two-manseat. Normal spacing for paratroopers is 24 inches. Aircraft without accommodations for 24-inchspacing will be configured for 20-inch spacing 3.1.2.  Pallet position six is limited to 4,759 pounds when rollers and ramp air deflectors are installed.With roller conveyors removed and ramp air deflectors installed, 4,919 pounds may be carried.

General. This chapter contains reference data to assist personnel in load planning. 4.2.  Emergency Exits and Safety Aisles. Load aircraft in such a manner that the following emergencyexits and safety aisles are available: 4.2.1.  At least one cabin emergency exit is unobstructed. 4.2.2.  At least one unobstructed emergency exit is available for each 20 passengers/troops. This doesnot restrict over water flights if the three overhead escape hatches are available for egress. Litters andseats erected across an emergency exit are not considered as an obstruction. 4.2.3.  When passengers are being airlifted, an unobstructed aisleway will be maintained in the wheelwell (pallet positions 3 & 4) and ramp area (pallet position 6) to provide access to emergency exits. Inthe wheel well area the aisleway will be a minimum of 14 inches wide. Access to aft latrine facilitiesrequires an 18-inch clear area on the forward left or right side of cargo loaded on the ramp. 4.2.4.  If the aisleway requirement in paragraph 4.2.3. cannot be achieved on missions carrying crewonly or mission-essential personnel authorized by operations order/plan or CFAC, then a safety aislewill be maintained in the wheel well area to provide the following minimum clearance. (Figure 4.1.) 4.2.4.1.  At least 14 inches between the outer edge of the cargo and aircraft beginning no higherthan 36 inches above the floor/pallet/platform. 4.2.4.2.  Or a minimum of 30 inches between the outer edge of cargo and the aircraft beginning nohigher than 60 inches above the floor/pallet/platform. 4.2.5.  During airdrop missions; loadmasters shall have access to the rear of the aircraft to accomplishtactical checklists. 4.2.6.  On all missions, cargo will be loaded in such a way that the crew will have access to the rear ofthe aircraft. The aircraft commander will be the final authority for determining if safety aisles/accessaft of cargo is adequate. Cargo loads in Section VI of T.O. 1C-130A-9, Cargo Loading Manual, arespecific and do not require a waiver. AFI11-2HC-130V3_ADDENDA-A   15 APRIL 200845Figure 4.1.  Wheel Well Safety Aisle  46AFI11-2HC-130V3_ADDENDA-A   15 APRIL 20084.3.  V-Blade Knife Sheath. 4.3.1.  Install V-blade knife with sheath assembly on the aircraft and enter it as special equipment onAF Form 4076, Aircraft Dash 21 Equipment Inventory. This knife can be used in an emergency torelease personnel and recovery lines such as parachute harnesses, shroud lines, survival vest webbing,etc. V-blade knife may also be used to cut release straps on container delivery system and ramp bun-dles. 4.3.2.  Units will order sufficient V-blades and keys, crash rescue type, MA-l knives: part number5367126 is listed in the 5110 stock catalog as 5110-524-6924 (local purchase). Upon receipt, unitswill: 4.3.2.1.  Disassemble and spray each part of the knife separately with clear, acrylic plastic or othersuitable preservative to prevent rusting and corrosion. Do not use Peralkatone. Reassemble knife,omitting the delta-shaped blade key. 4.3.2.2.  Locally manufacture sheath and plates per Figure 4.2. Construct the entire sheath assem-bly with canvas and cover with Duracote. 4.3.2.3.  Drill a 3/16- hole in the center of the handle, directly above the centerline of the shank. 4.3.2.4.  Tie a 10 ft. length of Type III Nylon (550 cord) to the knife through the drilled-hole andsecure the other end to the strap sewn into the stowage pocket of the sheath assembly. Fold theline. Do not coil it. Bind the line with a rubber band for neat stowage and to prevent tangling. 4.3.3.  Care of the V-blade knife. 4.3.3.1.  Inspect the knife for rust or corrosion during each preflight inspection. Remove rust andcorrosion and spray all parts with plastic or other preservative as often as necessary. 4.3.3.2.  After each use of the knife, remove the blade and sharpen, then recoat with preservative. AFI11-2HC-130V3_ADDENDA-A   15 APRIL 200847Figure 4.2.  V-Blade Knife and Sheath Assembly 48AFI11-2HC-130V3_ADDENDA-A   15 APRIL 20084.4.  Roller Conveyer Installation. 4.4.1.  Install roller conveyors on the cargo ramp end, and on the cargo floor. Four ten-foot sectionsare installed on the cargo ramp and eight eight-foot sections are on the cargo floor in J and K compart-ments. Center rollers over tiedown rings at buttline 20 left and right.  NOTE: If up to three 48’x 48” CRLs (RAMZ) are to be loaded, two ten-foot sections are installed on thecargo ramp and two eight-foot sections are on the cargo floor in J and K compartments (when required).  4.4.1.1.  A/A32H-4A Rollers. Due to past modification to the HC-130 cargo floor and ramp, the -4 rollers may not attach to the floor as they were designed. Locally manufactured braces and boltsare needed to secure the roller conveyors. Place two braces laterally across the top edge of eachroller conveyor frame, while the bolts are attached vertically through predrilled holes in the bracesto tiedown ring bolt receptacles. (See diagrams, this attachment) 4.4.2.  Until the HC-130 floors are modified by TCTO 1C-130(H)H-595C, D, E to accept rollers, thepreferred method of attaching - 4 rollers is with braces and bolts. If braces and bolts/keepers areunavailable, steel safety wire (0.032 or greater, not less than four turns) may be installed at three (min-imum) points to secure each roller conveyor section. This is a less desirable method of attachment. AFI11-2HC-130V3_ADDENDA-A   15 APRIL 200849Figure 4.3.  A/A32H-4 Roller Conveyor and Braces 50AFI11-2HC-130V3_ADDENDA-A   15 APRIL 2008Figure 4.4.

Introduction. This chapter provides instructions for computation and completion of DD Form 365-4.The Form F will be computed using simplified moments. All entries and signatures must be legible. 5.2.  Load Planning. The cargo load must be planned so that the center of gravity of the loaded aircraftwill be within the specified forward and aft limits for any given operating condition.
