Role  in  the  mission  (Unit/Base/Community  (during  natural  disasters)/Air Force). 5.1.3.  HMMWV design.  The design of HMMWV varies depending on the vehicle type.  Refer to the manufacturer’s operator’s manual for additional information on the specific HMMWV being operated, and to the data plate for safe load capacity guidance.  The HMMWV normally can be identified by the following characteristics:  5.1.3.1.  Four wheel drive (4WD) vehicle.  A four-wheeled vehicle with a drive train that allows all four wheels to receive torque from the engine simultaneously.  5.1.3.2.  All utilize a 6.2 or 6.5 liter V-8 diesel engine. 5.1.3.3.  Additional common components:  5.1.3.3.1.   Air brakes.          5.1.3.3.2.   Three speed automatic transmission. 5.1.3.3.3.   Power steering. 5.1.3.3.4.   Utilize a 24 volt electrical system. 5.1.3.3.5.   Fold down gate. Tailgate capacity is limited to 250 lb. when folded down. 5.1.4.  Specifications.    The  operator  should  refer  to  the  applicable  TO  or  data  plate  for information regarding the following:  5.1.4.1.  Specifications:    Dimensions/weight,  engine  drive  train  information,  turning radius, fluid types.  5.1.4.2.  Parts:  Counterweights and heavy weapon turret (if applicable).  5.1.4.3.  Steering:  Front wheel steering.  5.1.5.  Capabilities.  5.1.5.1.  Cruising  range  is  350  miles  when  traveling  at  30-40  miles  on  hard  surfaces  or rolling terrain.   5.1.5.2.  HMMWVs are  capable  of crossing 30 inches of still water at  5 miles per hour (mph)—or crossing 50 inches of water with a fording kit attached.  5.1.5.3.  Able to travel main roads, secondary roads, to include trails, stream beds, 18-22 inch steps, 60 degrees on vertical slopes (uphill or down) and 40 degrees on side slopes when traversing a hill sideways.  Note:  The degrees of being able to safely traverse an incline/decline or slope are affected by load weight and distribution as well as speed.  5.1.5.4.  The HMMWV has a 3,400 lb. towing capacity.  5.1.5.5.  Vehicle can climb grades of up to 60 degrees. .  5.1.5.6.  Vehicle can ford water up to 30 inches at 5mph (50 inches with fording kit).   5.1.6.  Tires.  5.1.6.1.  Tires  are  capable  of  driving  flat  by  utilizing  a  specially  designed  run-flat  tire manufactured by the Goodyear.    5.1.6.2.  These tires will appear 75% flat when punctured, but will provide for emergency driving at 30 mph for a distance of 30 miles.  5.1.6.3.  If both rear tires become flattened at the same time, the maximum speed is then 20 mph.  5.1.6.4.  A  lubricant  contained  inside  the  tires  provides  a  smoke  signal  to  the  operator indicating a flat has occurred.  5.1.6.5.  For off-road operations, place the vehicle neutral and then select the appropriate transfer case position.  I.E. low lock, when climbing or descending steep hills, operating in deep mud, snow, sand or other slippery conditions.  5.1.7.  The 4WD system.  A vehicle equipped with 4WD has the ability to use all four wheels to  power itself.  This  increases traction which may  enable  the operator  to safely drive over terrain and road conditions that a conventional two-wheel drive vehicle cannot.  Figure 5.1.  The 4WD System.   5.1.7.1.  Power is supplied to all four wheels through a transfer case or power transfer unit.  4WD vehicles allow the operator to select different drive modes as necessary.  5.1.7.2.  Refer  to  the  manufacturer’s  operator’s  manual  for  information  on  shifting procedures and maintenance.  5.1.7.3.  On some 4WD models, the initial shift from two-wheel drive to 4WD while the vehicle is moving can cause a momentary clunk and ratcheting sound.  These sounds are normal as the front drivetrain comes up to speed and is not cause for concern.  5.1.8.  Gauges, switches, instruments, lights and controls:  5.1.8.1.

When parking vehicle, be sure the light switch is in the OFF position and that all radio accessories are in the off position.  Failure to do so leaves the electrical system on and could result in discharged batteries.  5.4.20.  When  raising  and  securing  hood,  make  sure  the  hood  prop  rod  is  secured  to  hood support bracket.  Caution – If hood support bracket is not properly secured in raised position, this may cause damage to equipment or injury to personnel.  5.4.21.  When  releasing  hood  prop  rod,  do  not  pull  rod  at  hook  end.    Injury  to  fingers  will occur.  5.4.22.  Rollover risk warning.  The potential for a vehicle to rollover increases for vehicles with a high gross weight (20,000 lbs. or more) or a high center of gravity.  Check the vehicle’s data plate to determine if the vehicle is at higher risk for rollover.  5.4.22.1.   Rollover risk procedures.  The senior occupant will ensure that all personnel are checked for injuries and that injured personnel are given the appropriate medical attention.  Report the accident immediately, along with the injury report.  5.4.22.1.1.  Driver.    Release  the  accelerator.    Keep  hands  on  steering  wheel  with extended, but not locked, arms.  Tuck head into chest and brace for impact and yell, “ROLLOVER.”  5.4.22.1.2.  Passenger(s).  Tuck head into chest and brace for impact.  Plant feet firmly on the floor while holding onto a stationary object.  Yell, “ROLLOVER.”   5.4.22.1.3.  Gunner.  Drop down.  Tuck head into chest and brace for impact.  Plant feet firmly on the floor while holding onto a stationary object.  Yell, “ROLLOVER.” Note:  Gunners when operating the turret, limit body protrusion not to exceed name tag.  5.4.23.  Tire Changing Safety.  In the event that the vehicle should have a flat or damaged tire, the trainee must know how to safely and properly change the tire.  The following is the correct procedure for safely changing the tire:  5.4.23.1.   Tools/equipment.  5.4.23.1.1.  Vehicle jack w/jack handle.  5.4.23.1.2.  Lug wrench. 5.4.23.1.3.  Jack stand.       5.4.23.1.4.  Wheel chocks. 5.4.23.1.5.  Hand/eye/hearing protection (if pneumatic tools are going to be used). 5.4.23.1.6.  Gloves should be worn when lifting and positioning tires in order to protect hands.  5.4.23.2.   Ensure vehicle is seated on a level surface.  5.4.23.3.   Chock the adjacent drive wheel.  5.4.23.4.   Locate solid part of vehicle’s frame.  5.4.23.5.   Place the vehicle jack under the vehicle’s frame as close as possible that will not impede tire removal and/or replacement.  5.4.23.6.   Raise the vehicle with the jack until the vehicle’s weight is supported on the jack but the tire is still in contact with the ground.  5.4.23.7.   Loosen, do NOT remove, lug nuts.  5.4.23.8.   Jack the vehicle up until the tire clears the ground with no more than an extra inch to allow replacement of tire.  5.4.23.9.   Place jack stand under  frame of the vehicle to  support  the vehicle in  case the jack’s hydraulic should leak and/or fail.  5.4.23.10.  Remove the vehicle’s lug nuts.  5.4.23.11.  Remove the vehicle’s flat/damaged tire.  5.4.23.12.  Place replacement tire onto the vehicle’s axle.  5.4.23.13.  Replace vehicle’s lug nuts (to hand tight).  5.4.23.14.  Jack vehicle up and remove jack stand.  5.4.23.15.  Lower vehicle until it makes contact with the ground.  5.4.23.16.  Tighten vehicle’s lug nuts in a star pattern.  Note:  As soon as possible, take the vehicle to Vehicle Maintenance to have the vehicle’s wheel torqued to manufacturer’s specifications.  5.4.24.  Off-road driving.  For more information on off-road driving and safe vehicle operation guidance, refer to AFMAN 24-306.  5.4.24.1.   Rocky terrain.  Do not try to straddle large boulders.  They will damage axles and other low parts of the vehicle.  Move slowly over rocky terrain.  5.4.24.2.   Mud and swamps.  5.4.24.2.1.  Try  to  pull  out  of  the  mud/swamp  slowly  in  low  gear  if  the  vehicle  is equipped with automatic transmission.  Place boards, brush or similar material under the vehicle’s wheels to increase traction.   5.4.24.2.2.  Roll onto the soft area at a medium speed for the selected gear.  Carefully maintain a steady throttle until the vehicle reaches solid ground. 5.4.24.2.3.  If the vehicle is automatic, try to pull out slowly by using the low gear.  If using a lower gear, using boards or using brush does not work, try to use another vehicle to pull the vehicle out.  5.4.24.3.   Sand.  Estimate to make sure a sandy area is drivable.  Adjust tire pressure if needed to meet the conditions.  Exercise sound driving techniques.  5.4.24.3.1.  Reduce  tire  pressure  when  driving  in  soft  sand  and  over  dunes.    When operating  with  reduced  tire  pressure,  drive  at  a  low  speed.    Inflate  tires  to  normal pressure as soon as the situation permits.  5.4.24.3.2.  To start driving on sand be sure tires have the proper pressure.  Select  a gear or range that will start the vehicle with a minimum of or no clutch slippage and wheel spinning.  Accelerate gradually.    5.4.24.3.3.  To maintain driving on sand, remain at a steady rate of movement.  Avoid unnecessary  shifting  of  gears;  with  automatics  keep  it  in  low  range.    Stop  before entering areas with soft sand and reduce tire pressure, as necessary.  As soon as the need for low tire pressure ceases, re-inflate the tires to normal pressure. 5.4.24.3.4.  Approach  the  dune  from  the  windward  slope  at  a  90°  angle.    Select  the proper gear or range to avoid shifting while on the slope.  Maintain as much momentum as possible while going up the slope; be prepared to  change direction as  the vehicle reaches the crest. 5.4.24.3.5.  In order to stop in the sand, let the vehicle roll to a halt.  Otherwise brake gradually.  Try to stop on a downhill slope.  It will give the operator the advantage if he/she needs to restart the vehicle.        5.5. Operation.  5.5.1.  Starting procedures.  Note:  The HMMWV is a turbo diesel unit and requires that the glow plugs be given time to warm-up prior to starting.   If this procedure is overlooked, the engine will crank but will not start.  5.5.1.1.  Apply parking brake.  5.5.1.2.  Place transmission shift lever in N (Neutral).  5.5.1.3.  Do not leave rotary switch in RUN once WAIT-TO-START lamp assembly goes out.  Damage to glow plugs will result.  5.5.1.4.  Do not use starting fluid or any other fluid for the purpose of assisting in starting procedures.  This will result in damage to the glow plugs and the engine.  Note:  Do not overtax the starter or battery.  Do not crank the starter for more than 20 seconds at a time.  Wait at least 10-15 seconds between attempts.  5.5.1.5.  Once the “wait” light has extinguished, place ignition rotary switch to START.  Release lever after engine starts.  Lever will return automatically to RUN.  5.5.1.6.  To turn on lights, lift the “unlock” lever and hold in position.  5.5.1.7.  Turn the selector switch lever to any ON position except B.O. marker.  5.5.1.8.  Turn auxiliary lever to DIM or PANEL BRT.  For normal daylight driving, turn selector lever to STOPLIGHT.  5.5.1.9.  For blackout operations push selector to B.O. DRIVE.  5.5.1.10.   When vehicle is parked, place the lever in B.O. MARKER.  5.5.1.11.   Check the instruments while allowing engine to warm up for approximately one minute.  5.5.1.12.   Immediately stop engine if any of the following conditions occur:  5.5.1.12.1.  Excessive engine vibration.  5.5.1.12.2.  Oil  pressure  does  not  register  or  suddenly  drops  to  or  less  than approximately 6 psi with engine at idle. 5.5.1.12.3.  Sudden  increase  in  coolant  temperature  beyond  normal  operating temperature of approximately 190° to 230°F as indicated by engine coolant temperature gauge.     Note:  Do not attempt to tow or push start the HMMWV.  If the operator has the start/run switch in the RUN position, but does not start the engine, he or she could cause damage to the glow plugs or drain the battery.  5.5.2.  Slave starting operations.  5.5.2.1.  A slave cable is one large cable that connects from one running North Atlantic Treaty  Organization  (NATO)  vehicle  (i.e.  deuce,  etc.)  to  the  dead  vehicle.    There  is  no positive and negative like normal vehicles.  5.5.2.2.  The operator hooks up one end of the slave cable to the running vehicle and the other end to the dead vehicle and jump as they would normal vehicles.  The slave cables should have 24 prongs attached.  5.5.2.3.  The slave cables are used for NATO vehicles only.  5.5.2.4.  Position slaving vehicle and disabled vehicle close enough for cable hookup.  5.5.2.5.  Stop slaving vehicle engine.  5.5.2.6.  Remove cover from slave receptacle of disabled vehicle and slaving vehicle.  5.5.2.7.  Warning  – Ensure all battery cables in  disabled vehicle are properly  connected before connecting slave cable.  Damage to batteries, cables or serious injury to personnel may result from improperly connected batteries.  5.5.2.8.  Caution  –  Use  a  twisting  motion  when  installing  slave  cable  to  the  receptacle.  Forcefully  pushing  the  cable  onto  the  receptacle  may  cause  damage  to  the  receptacle mount.  Note:  Ensure all electrical switches in both vehicles are turned-off.  5.5.2.9.  Connect slave cable to the slave receptacle of both vehicles.  5.5.2.10.   Start slaving vehicle engine.  5.5.2.11.   Start disabled vehicle engine.  5.5.2.12.   After engine starts, disconnect slave cable from both vehicles.  Note:  For easy removal, apply hand cleaner on the inside of the cover before installing receptacle covers.  5.5.2.13.   Install receptacle covers on both vehicles.  5.5.3.  Basic operation.    5.5.3.1.  Once  the  engine  is  at  operating  temperature  and  all  other  gauges  are  reading normal, depress the foot brake, release the hand brake and place the vehicle in the desired driving position.  5.5.3.2.  Reverse.    The  vehicle  needs  to  be  at  a  complete  stopping  prior  to  shifting  to reverse to  avoid damage to the transmission.  Always use a spotter when backing.  The operator must always maintain visual contact with the spotter.  If the operator loses visual contact, he or she should immediately stop the vehicle.  See AFMAN 24-306 for additional information on spotter safety and standard spotter hand signals.  5.5.4.  4WD operation.  Table 5.1.  4WD Operation Transmission Controls.  Control Overdrive  (D)  w/circle around it Drive (no circle) Park (P) Reverse (R) 2nd Gear 1st Gear Low Lock (L) Neutral (N) High (H) High Lock (HL) Description For highway driving. Normal driving, trailer and fording. Used to park the vehicle. Used to drive the vehicle in reverse. For hill climbing and engine braking. For  steep  hill  climbing  or  driving  through mud, sand or snow. Used  for  climbing  or  descending  steep  hills and operating in deep mud, sand or snow. Disengages both driving axles.  This position can  be  used  if  the  vehicle  stalls  in  order  to restart the vehicle.  Always ensure the vehicle has the hand brake set when using neutral. Used for normal highway driving and fording. Used for driving through mud, snow, off-road and slippery road conditions.  Note:  Warning – Damage to transfer case will result if the transfer case is operated in “L” (low lock) or “H/L” (high lock) on dry paved surfaces for sustained periods.  5.5.4.1.  Vehicle  must  be  stopped  and  transmission  shift  lever  in  “N”  (neutral)  before transfer case can be shifted.  Failure to do this will result in damage to the transfer case.  5.5.4.2.  When  parking  the  vehicle,  ensure  the  transfer  case  is  left  in  High.    If  not,  the vehicle  may  roll  since  both  axles  are  disengaged  when  the  transfer  case  is  in  “N”.  Regardless of the position of the transmission shift lever, setting the parking brake is also required.  5.5.5.  Electrical winch operation.   5.5.5.1.  The vehicle electrical system is used to power the winch.  Have the engine running while operating the winch so the alternator recharges the battery.  5.5.5.2.  Preparation for use:  5.5.5.2.1.   Park vehicle directly facing object to be winched. Place transmission shift lever in N (neutral).  5.5.5.2.2.   Apply parking brake.   5.5.5.2.3.   Start engine. 5.5.5.2.4. Chock wheels.  5.5.5.3.  Unwinding winch cable.     5.5.5.3.1.   Wear leather gloves when handling winch cable.  Do not handle cable with bare hands.  Broken wires cause injury. 5.5.5.3.2.   Do not power out winch cable for more than 10 ft.  Use FREE SPOOL for paying out long lengths of winch cable.  Failure to FREE SPOOL long lengths of winch cable may cause damage to winch. 5.5.5.3.3.   Forward looking aft, turn clutch lever counterclockwise to FREE SPOOL. 5.5.5.3.4.   Pull off cable by hand to desired length and connect to load. 5.5.5.3.5.   When fully extending the winch cable, ensure that four wraps of winch cable remain on drum at all times.  Failure to do so may cause injury or death to personnel or damage  to  the  winch.    Note:    Refer  to  the  manufacturer’s  operator’s  manual  for guidance on required slack for the winch cable prior to starting of winching operations.  This allows time for the winch motor to start-up for maximum pulling power.  5.5.5.4.  Pulling load.  5.5.5.4.1.   Install remote control switch by connecting plug to connector.  If clutch does not disengage easily, rotate the drum to align gears.  5.5.5.4.2.   Turn clutch lever clockwise to ENGAGED. 5.5.5.4.3.   Remove remote control switch from stowage box. 5.5.5.4.4.   Warning – Direct all personnel to stand clear of winch cable during winch operation. A snapped winch cable will cause injury or death.        Note:    The  electric  winch  is  equipped  with  a  thermal  cut  off  switch  to  prevent  winch  from overheating or exceeding pull  capacity.   If winch stops during operation, wait approximately  2 minutes to let winch cool off.  If after 5 minutes winch is still inoperative, notify organizational maintenance.      5.5.5.4.5.   Operate remote control switch to IN or OUT until load has been retrieved.  5.5.5.4.6.   Do  not  fully  apply  handle  throttle  during  engine  NO  LOAD  condition.  Damage to engine may result. 5.5.5.4.7.   The electric winch is equipped with a thermal cutoff switch to prevent winch from  overheating.    If  winch  stops  during  operation  and  does  not  restart  within  5 seconds, wait approximately 2 minutes to let the winch cool off and to allow the thermal switch  to  reset.    If  after  5  minutes,  the  winch  is  still  inoperative,  notify  Vehicle Management. 5.5.5.4.8.   Engine speed is maintained for battery charging only and will not change winch operating speed. 5.5.5.4.9.  Pull handle throttle out until desired engine speed is obtained (inside vehicle, right of steering wheel). 5.5.5.4.10.  Operate  remote  control  switch  to  IN  or  OUT  until  the  load  has  been retrieved.  5.5.5.5.  Securing winch after operation.   5.5.5.5.1.   Winch cable must be wound on to the drum under a load of at least 500 lbs. or outer wraps will draw in to the inner wraps and damage winch cable.  5.5.5.5.2.   Wind winch cable until hook is 4 ft. from cable guide. 5.5.5.5.3.   Turn  clutch  lever  counterclockwise  to  FREE  SPOOL  and  rotate  drum  by hand to retrieve the remaining cable. 5.5.5.5.4.   Remove remote control switch by disconnecting plug from connector. 5.5.5.5.5.   Turn clutch lever clockwise to ENGAGED. 5.5.5.5.6.   Release hand throttle (inside vehicle, right of steering wheel).  Place remote control switch in stowage box.          5.5.6.  Runflat operations.  5.5.6.1.  The vehicles are equipped with run flat devices, allowing the vehicle to be driven with one or more tires flat.  For more on vehicle-specific run flat operations, refer to the manufacturer’s operator’s manual.  5.5.6.2.  Do  not  exceed  30  mph  (48  kilometers  per  hour  (kph)  during  any  run  flat operations.  Do not exceed 20 mph (32 kph) with both rear tires flat.  Loss of vehicle control may occur, causing damage to equipment and injury or death to personnel.  5.5.6.3.  Speeds indicated in the manufacturer’s operator’s manual are the maximum and must be reduced when traveling on secondary roads, cross- country, or in traffic.  Failure to reduce speeds could cause loss of control of vehicle causing damage to equipment and injury or death to personnel.  5.5.6.4.  When  driving  vehicle  road  and  weather  conditions  are  constantly  changing.  Never drive at a speed greater than is reasonable and prudent for these conditions.  Loss of vehicle control may occur, causing damage to equipment and injury or death to personnel.  5.5.6.5.  A wheel that has been run flat must be replaced and inspected by unit maintenance as soon as possible before reuse, or damage to equipment may result.  5.5.6.6.  Run flat operation may cause the bead to separate from the tire and/or wheel.  If abnormal handling is experienced or noise such as flapping or pounding around the wheel well occurs, the tread needs to be cut away from the wheel before continuing operation.  Failure to do so could result in damage to the vehicle.   Note:  Run flat travel distance will improve with rubber run flat.  If additional travel is required tire tread may be cut away from tire.  5.5.7.  Operations under blackout conditions.  5.5.7.1.  Blackout procedures.     5.5.7.1.1.   When  operating  under  blackout  conditions,  be  sure  the  blackout  marker lights are functioning correctly.  5.5.7.1.2.   Lower the windshield to improve visibility.  5.5.7.1.3.   Drive at reduced speeds.  5.5.7.1.4.   If in a column, watch the rear blackout marker lights of the vehicle ahead to follow at the correct distance.  Remember the white blackout stoplight of the vehicle ahead is on the right and left side.  5.5.7.2.  Blackout marker lights.      5.5.7.2.1.   To  show  the  location  of  vehicles  during  blackouts,  military  vehicles  are equipped with four blackout marker lights.  Two of these lights are on the rear corners of the vehicles and the other two are on the front.  They do not illuminate the road, but indicate  the  position  of  a  vehicle  as  much  as  250  yards  ahead,  depending  on  the weather. They cannot be seen from an airplane flying higher than 400 feet.  5.5.7.2.2.   When  operating  a  vehicle  in  a  convoy  under  blackout  conditions,  if practicable, post a person equipped with a screened flashlight or a large white piece of material  in  the rear of the  vehicle to  warn the following driver if he approaches too closely.  5.5.7.2.2.1.  An  alert  rear  guard  can  usually  detect  a  vehicle  at  a  reasonable distance, even with no lamps.   5.5.7.2.2.2.  In blackout operations, vehicles will maintain a speed of 5 to 10 mph (8 to 16 kph). 5.5.7.2.2.3.  When a vehicle is disabled on the side of the road, the driver is posted at  the  rear  with  a  screened  flashlight  or  large  white  piece  of  material  to  warn approaching vehicles of the danger. 5.5.7.2.3.   Taillights:  Each rear lamp has two pairs of “cat’s eyes” that show red when on.  Each  pear  appears  as  one  red  light  when  the  vehicle  is  60  to  180  feet  (20  to  60 yards) away and as two pairs of cat’s eyes in each light at less than 60 feet.  5.5.7.2.3.1.  One point of light tells the operator that he or she is too far behind the vehicle ahead. Two lights assure the operator that he or she is following at a proper distance.  Four lights warn that the operator is getting too close.   5.5.7.2.3.2.  Normally, the blackout stoplight is a separate unit mounted on the right and left taillights.  It flashes a white light when the brakes are applied.       Figure. 5.2.  Rear Blackout Lights.    5.5.7.2.4.   Front lights:  Each front light has one pair of cat’s eyes.  They show white when on.  Each pair appears as one light when more than 60 feet away.  When 60 feet away, one pair of cat’s eyes in each light can be seen.  This warns that the vehicle is near.   5.5.7.2.5.   Blackout driving light:  The blackout driving light is mounted to the left of the  left  headlight.    It  furnishes  a  different  light  beam  for  limited  illumination  when driving under blackout conditions.  Figure.  5.3.  Front Blackout Marker Lights and Blackout Driving Lights.   5.5.8.  Shutdown procedures.   5.5.8.1.  Place transmission shift level to N (neutral).  5.5.8.2.  If vehicle must be backed into a parking position, have another person act as a spotter to direct reverse operation.  5.5.8.3.  Apply parking brake.    5.5.8.4.  When  parking  the  vehicle,  be  sure  that  the  light  switch  is  in  the  OFF  position.  Failure to do so leaves the electrical system on and could result in a discharged battery.  5.5.8.5.  Chock wheels if necessary.  5.5.8.6.  Allow the HMMWV to idle for approximately 3 to 5 minutes prior to shutting the engine off.  This step is imperative on the turbo diesel to give it time to let the oil  drain away from the iron cylinder block and avoid damaging the seals and gaskets.  5.5.8.7.  Turn ignition rotary switch to ENG STOP.  Section 6—EXPLANATION AND DEMONSTRATION.  6.1. Instructor’s Preparation.  6.1.1.  Establish a training location.  6.1.2.
