Recognition Program Introduction.  The goal of the AF Recognition Program is to foster mission accomplishment by recognizing excellence of both military and civilian members of the force and motivating them to high levels of performance and service.  Monetary awards are also authorized  to  recognize  the  scientific  achievements  and  inventions  of  military  personnel.  Specific  information  on  awards  for military  personnel is  found  in  AFI  36-2803,  The  Air  Force Military Awards and Decorations Program.  Whenever possible, the service, accomplishments, and  performance  of  military  and  civilian  members  will  be  recognized  at  combined  awards ceremonies. 1.2.  Civilian Recognition  Program Objective.  The AF Civilian Recognition Program will be administered by Headquarters Air Force (HAF), commanders, managers, and supervisors on the basis of merit without regard to age, sex, race, color, religion, national origin, marital status, or physical or mental handicap.  Commanders, managers, and supervisors will make special efforts to ensure that minorities, women, and other under-represented groups are included among those given fair consideration for monetary or honorary awards.  The program is intended to provide special awards for superior accomplishments. 1.3.  Purpose:  This  AFI  prescribes  guidance  and  procedures  governing  the  AF  Incentive Awards Program and delegates authority, assigns responsibility, and establishes requirements for awards and awards programs for civilian employees within the AF.  It also establishes AF-level awards for private citizens, groups or organizations. 1.4.  Program Administration: 1.4.1.  The goal of the AF Civilian Awards Program is to foster mission accomplishment by recognizing  excellence  in  its  civilian  employees  and  motivating  them  to  high  levels  of performance and service.  The AF Civilian Incentive Awards program will be administered by HAF, commanders, directors, managers, and supervisors at all levels.  They will: 1.4.1.1.  Ensure that awards are granted consistent with Equal Opportunity (EO) program and affirmative employment program policies and are free from discrimination regardless of  age,  sex,  race,  color,  religion,  national  origin,  marital  status,  or  physical  or  mental disability.  Discrimination  based  on  sexual  orientation  is  prohibited  as  prescribed  by DoDD 1020.02E, Diversity Management and Equal Opportunity in the DoD. 1.4.1.2.  Ensure  that  special  efforts  are  made  to  ensure  under-represented  groups  are included among those given fair consideration for all incentive awards. 1.4.1.3.  Ensure  that  monetary,  time-off,  and  honorary  awards  are  used  as  individual  or group  awards.      These  awards  can  be  granted  while  on  detail  or  temporary  assignment. Nominations should be submitted through proper channels within 60 days of act or event. 1.5.  Monetary  and  Honorary  Awards.  Monetary  and  honorary  awards  should  be  granted when  merited  regardless  of  the  employee’s  grade,  level  of  responsibility,  or  type  of responsibility.    It  is  important  that  awards  be  granted  for  job-related  contributions  only  if  the AFI36-1004  29 AUGUST 2016   7  contribution is clearly beyond performance requirements.  Awards under this chapter should not be used to replace or supplemental performance awards. 1.5.1.  Monetary  and  honorary  incentive  awards  granted  in  the  previous  performance evaluation  cycle  cannot  be  used  to  support  an  annual  performance  award  in  the  upcoming performance evaluation cycle. 1.5.2.  Honorary  awards  normally  require  a  minimum  of  a  year  of  effort.    See  specific guidance for each honorary award. 1.5.3.  Honorary  awards  may  be  given  to  civilian  employees  at  any  time  in  their  careers, including  occasions  such  as  retirement,  reassignment,  transfer,  or  separation,  provided  the individual’s accomplishments fully meet the criteria for the particular award. 1.5.4.  Monetary awards may be subject to budgetary guidelines determined by the Office of Management  Budget.    Guidance  on  budget  limitations  can  be  obtained  from  the  local  or MAJCOM level civilian Personnel and/or finance office. 1.6.  Special  Command  Trophies  and  Awards.  The  AF  encourages  installations  to  establish unique honorary awards to recognize superior accomplishments.  Likewise, the establishment of local quarterly or annual awards programs is encouraged.  In such events, these programs should conform to guidance cited in paragraph 2.1.10 of this publication. (T-3) 1.6.1.  Installations  will notify  AFPC/DPSIDR  before  presenting a  special  command  trophy or  award  to  a  nationally  prominent  person  serving  as  an  unpaid  expert  or  consultant.    The notification  will  include  the  name  of  the  person,  a  copy  of  the  awards  committee  minutes, and other supporting  data.  Nominations should be submitted to  AFPC/DPSIDR at  least 60 calendar days before the presentation ceremony. 1.6.2.  Installations  may  present  non-monetary  awards  and  define  such  items  as  a  medal, certificate,  plaque,  citation,  badge,  or  other  similar  items  that  have  an  award  or  honor connotation.  Installations  may  give  items  with  the  command  or  organization  logo,  such  as belt buckles and jackets, but such items must be valued at less than $60. 1.7.  Federal  and  Non-Federal  Awards.  Refer to AFI 36-2805, Special Trophies and Awards for  a  complete  listing  of  federal  and  non-federal  awards,  and  the  criteria  and  nomination procedures for these awards. 1.8.  Incentive Awards from Other Federal Departments. 1.8.1.  AF  employees  may  receive  monetary  and  honorary  incentive  awards  from  other Federal departments and agencies for contributions only when the accomplishments are very significant and beyond those covered during annual performance evaluation cycles.  The AF may  grant  monetary  and  honorary  incentive  awards  to  employees  of  other  Federal departments and agencies when their contributions benefit the AF. 1.8.2.  Occasionally,  a  manager  outside  an  employee’s  chain  of  command  may  wish  to nominate an employee for an award.  Examples are as follows: 1.8.2.1.  When  an  employee  has  been  assigned  to  a  long-term  detail  outside  his  or  her organization. 1.8.2.2.  When  an  employee  has  completed  a  special  project  or  has  given  extraordinary service benefiting a serviced organization.   8  AFI36-1004  29 AUGUST 2016 1.8.3.  On  these  occasions,  the  nomination  must  be  coordinated  with  the  employee’s permanent, assigned organization and/or chain of command before it is submitted. 1.9.  Monetary  Incentive  Awards  to  Employees  of  Other  Federal  Agencies.  The  AF  unit sponsoring  monetary  incentive  awards  to  employees  of  other  Federal  departments  or  agencies must  provide  funding  from  their  own  civilian  pay  resources  to  cover  the  costs.    Consider  an honorary award if the cost of transferring funds for a monetary award exceeds the value of the award. 1.10.  Foreign  Decorations.  Not  all  items  tendered  by,  or  received  from  foreign  governments, are  considered  by  the  US  government  to  be  foreign  decorations.    To  comply  with  DoDD 1005.13,  Gifts  and  Decorations  from  Foreign  Governments,  and  DoDI  1400.25,  Volume  451, AF employees may be required to request acceptance of a foreign award or decoration.  The key factor  to  determine  a  foreign  decoration  is  whether  the  item  is  similar  in  nature  to  individual decorations awarded by the US government. 1.10.1.  AF employees may accept foreign decorations tendered in recognition of service in connection  with  combat  operations  or  awarded  for  outstanding  or  unusually  meritorious performance only upon receiving official approval to accept the award or decoration. 1.10.2.  The  ERB  approves  and  disapproves  acceptance  for  career  CSEs.    Requests  are submitted via  Usaf.pentagon.saf-aa-mbx.saf-aarc-workflow@mail.mil. to  SAF/AAR electronically 1.10.3.  MAJCOM,  FOA,  DRU  Directors  of  Personnel  approve/disapprove  acceptance  for AF employees (except career CSE) under their purview. 1.10.3.1.  AF members who have been told a foreign nation has made formal offer of an award  or  decoration  to  them  may  participate  in  a  formal  presentation  ceremony  and receive the decoration when accepting the award is not prejudicial to military or national interest.    The  recipient  of  the  foreign  award  or  decoration  in  this  manner  does  not constitute official acceptance, unless an official determination of acceptance was made by a  representative  of  the  US  government  (DoS,  US  Embassy,  USDAO,  or  Military Command).   To gain official acceptance,  the recipient  must  forward a request to  accept and  retain  the  award  or  decoration  to  the  appropriate  approval  authority.    The  request must be made through the Civilian Personnel Section (CPS) in memorandum format and contain the following information: 1.10.3.2.  Full name of the recipient, the title of the decoration, the country offering it, the date and place of presentation, the name and title of the person making the presentation, the  location  and  organization  awarding  the  decoration;  a  brief  description  of  the  act  or service performed; and a citation – an English translation of the citation is required. 1.10.3.3.  AFI  51-901,  Gifts  from  Foreign  Governments,  provides  for  employees  of  the US  Government,  including  members  of  the  US  Armed  Forces,  to  accept  gifts  or decorations  from  a  foreign  government  under  certain  conditions.    No  DoD  employee, however,  may  request  or  otherwise  encourage  the  offer  of  a  decoration  from  a  foreign government.  Refer to DoDD 1005.13, for the policies and procedures applicable to the acceptance of gifts from foreign governments. AFI36-1004  29 AUGUST 2016   9  1.11.  Posthumous  Awards.  All  monetary  and  honorary  incentive  awards  can  be  presented posthumously.    Justification  should  be  written  in  past  tense.    Refer  to  Attachment  3  of  this publication for citation wording. 1.12.  Presenting  and  Publicizing  Awards.  The  installation  commander,  civilian  leader, director,  management  official,  or  supervisor  recognizes  employees  and  presents  awards  at  a suitable  ceremony.    When  an  AF  employee  receives  recognition  outside  the  AF,  (e.g.,  the Department  of  Defense  (DoD)  Distinguished  Civilian  Service  Award),  the  employee’s  owning AF organization will make all the presentation arrangements with the awarding party, to include protocol requirements, set-up, etc.  In addition, all levels of command will ensure all significant civilian  achievements  and/or  contributions  are  recognized  and  publicized  in  the  installation media as well as the local community. (T-3) 1.13.  Eligibility  for  Multiple  Federal  Awards.  Refer to paragraph 4.1 of this publication for prohibitions. 1.13.1.  Multiple federal award eligibility for employees is generally restricted and only one award may be granted for a single act, achievement, or period of service. 1.13.1.1.  Only  one  AF  honorary  award  may  be  given  for  a  single  act,  achievement,  or period of service. 1.13.1.2.  Dual  recognition  may  not  be  given  to  recognize  a  civilian  employee  for  the same  act  or  achievement  previously  given  with  an  incentive  award  or  performance appraisal award. 1.13.1.3.  An  honorary  award  may  not  be  given  to  recognize  an  act  or  achievement  for which military recognition was previously given. 1.13.2.  In limited situations an employee may be eligible for multiple federal awards for the same period of service or the same act or achievement. 1.13.2.1.  Retirement  awards  recognize  long-term  service  that  may  include  multiple honorary awards. 1.13.2.2.  Time-off  awards  are  authorized  in  conjunction  with  rating-based  performance awards.  Refer to AFI 36-1001, Managing the Civilian Performance Program. 1.14.  Who  Can  Nominate.  Nominations  for  awards  may  be  sponsored  or  endorsed  only  by  a current DoD civilian employee or Service member. 1.15.  Certificates  in  Braille.  All  AF  award  certificates  for  blind  or  visually  impaired  award  recipients    must    have    Braille    overlaid    lettering    as    well    as    standard    print.    Use  local purchase authority to obtain these certificates. 1.16.  Ordering  Medals.  Requisition  medals  for  honorary  awards,  campaign  and  service awards,  public  service  awards,  ribbons,  lapel  pins,  and  devices  through  appropriate  supply channels.  Do not locally procure the items, unless so specified in this AFI.  The DoD does not issue  items  by  foreign  governments;  they  may  be  available  commercially  at  the  individual’s expense. 1.17.  Replacing  Medals.  A  person,  or  the  representative  of  a  person,  may  receive  a  one-time replacement medal, without charge, if the previously issued medal or other device issued is lost, destroyed, or rendered unfit for use, without fault or neglect on the part of the recipient or their   10  AFI36-1004  29 AUGUST 2016 representative.    Requester  should  submit  to  the  servicing  CPS,  MAJCOM,  DRU  or  FOA  to validate records prior  to replacement  of  medal or  device. All other replacement  medals will  be provided at cost. 1.18.  Replacing Certificates.  A person, or the representative of a person, may have their lost or destroyed certificates replaced by the approval authority only if the requestor certifies, in writing, that  the  certificate  was  lost  or  destroyed.    When  replacing  a  certificate,  enter  the  words “replacement  certificate”  in  the  bottom  right  corner  of  the  certificate.    This  annotation  will indicate that the certificate is a replacement. 1.19.  Engraving  Medals.  Do  not  engrave  honorary  awards  for  living  recipients.    For posthumous  awards  engrave  honorary  awards  and  the  Secretary  of  Defense  Medal  for  the Defense of Freedom only.  Engrave, in capital letters the awardee's first name, middle initial, last name.  The name may be split if necessary (refer to Figure 1.1). Figure 1.1.  Example Name Engraving. 1.19.1.  If first name,  middle initial, and last  name can't  fit on the medal, use  initial of first name, middle initial, and last name only (example: F. J. HORST). 1.19.2.  Use standard font block letters; do not use fancy fonts.  AFI36-1004  29 AUGUST 2016   11  SPECIFIC AND GENERAL RESPONSIBILITIES AND ELIGIBILITIES Chapter 2 2.1.  Responsibilities: 2.1.1.

General  Information.  The  AF  considers  approved  monetary  awards  to  be  valid obligations of the government that must be paid, subject only to availability of funds and meeting legal regulatory requirements. 3.1.1.  Each activity should budget a percentage of its annual civilian pay budget for funding awards. 3.1.2.  When an employee has transferred to another organization or agency the nominating organization  pays  the  costs  and  provides  the  funding  information  to  the  employee’s organization.  If the administrative cost of transferring funds would exceed the amount of the award, the employing agency will absorb the award cost and pay the award. 3.1.3.  Monetary  incentive  awards  do  not  substitute  for  personnel  actions,  pay,  or performance awards. 3.1.4.  Unit  resource  advisors/managers  must  validate  funds  are  available  for  awards  paid outside of the annual performance evaluation cycle. 3.2.  Special  Act  or  Service  Award  (SASA).

SASA  recognizes  contributions  for  a  non-recurring  special  achievement  that  is  not otherwise recognized with a rating-based performance award. 3.2.3.  Career Civilian Senior Executive (CSE) employees are not eligible for SASA awards. 3.2.4.  The  act  or  service  to  be  recognized  must  not  have  served  in  whole  or  in  part  as  the basis for a previous cash award or TOA. 3.2.5.  The amount awarded for a SASA may range from $501 to $25,000 depending on the achievement being recognized.  The amount awarded for a SASA should be based upon the tangible and intangible benefits to the government.  Cash award criteria is outlined in tables 3.1 and 3.2. 3.2.6.  Process.

Granting Time-Off Awards.  The Time-Off Award (TOA) is only authorized to recognize superior accomplishments of an employee that contributed to the quality, efficiency, or economy of government operations.  The TOA grants time off from duty without loss of pay or charge to leave. These awards provide an alternative to monetary or non-monetary recognition for superior accomplishments.  A TOA can be granted for performance as reflected in the employee’s most recent  rating  of  record  and  can  be  granted  in  lieu  of,  or  in  conjunction  with,  a  rating-based performance  award.    Decisions  to  grant  TOAs  shall  be  based  upon  the  same  criteria  or circumstances as for other incentive awards (i.e., SASA), and should be made within 30 calendar days of the act, service or achievement.  The period of time-off granted is based upon the value of the individual’s contribution, not upon the individual’s grade or salary. 4.1.1.  Immediate  supervisors  may  approve  a  TOA  up  to  one  workday  without  review  and approval  of  a  higher  official.    An  award  in  excess  of  one  day  must  be  approved  by  the employee’s second-level supervisor. 4.1.2.  Civilian employees forfeiting a TOA due to activation for Guard or Reserve duty, or for combat service, are entitled to reinstatement of their award.  A reinstated TOA must be used  within  6  months  of  deactivation  from  active  service  or  redeployment  from  combat service. 4.1.3.  A  TOA  will  not  be  granted  broadly  across  organizational  (flight,  squadron,  group, etc.) lines or on an installation-wide basis.  They shall not be granted in conjunction with a military “down,” “goal,” “family,” “training” day, or the like which would grant the entire or majority  of  the  civilian  employee  population  a  TOA  to  be  used  on  a  specified  day.  Furthermore,  a  TOA  shall  not  be  granted  in  order  to  provide  a  reconstitution  period  to returning  deployed  civilians  or  to  create  the  effect  of  a  holiday  or  treated  as  administrative excusals or leave. 4.2.  Eligibility.  Employees, including career CSE and direct-hire FNEs, meeting the definition of 5 USC 2105 are eligible to receive a TOA.  Indirect-hire FNEs are eligible for these awards only  if  an  incentive  awards  program  established  by  agreement  with  the  host  country  includes such a provision. the team to  a team  effort  caused 4.2.1.  Civilian Team Incentive Award.  A TOA may be granted to those employees whose individual  contributions to  achieve  superior accomplishments.    It  should  be  recognized  that  some  members  of  a  team  might  not  have contributed substantially to the team’s overall success.  As such, a TOA may only be offered to  employees  who  contributed  to  the  overall  team  accomplishment.  Where  recognition  is based  on  the  achievement  of  pre-established  goals,  measures,  or  other  award  formula,  the goal,  measure  or  formula  justifying  recognition  must  itself  clearly  represent  superior accomplishments.    To  grant  time-off  in  this  manner,  the  performance  outcomes  must  be  so significant that this type of award is clearly warranted and a benefit to the AF.  See paragraph 4.1 for the  basic requirements for  granting  the TOA and paragraphs  4.3.1, 4.3.7, and 4.3.8, for additional restrictions relevant to the use of team incentive awards.   22  AFI36-1004  29 AUGUST 2016 4.3.  Time-Off Award Restrictions. 4.3.1.  The maximum amount of time-off that may be approved for any single contribution is 40 hours. Employees working a typical 80-hour pay period may be awarded a total time-off of 80 hours during any leave year. 4.3.2.  For  part-time  employees  or  those  with  an  uncommon  tour  of  duty,  the  total  time  off granted  during  any  calendar  year  must  be  based  on  the  average  number  of  hours  generally worked during a two-week period.  The maximum award for any single contribution is one- half the maximum amount of time that can be granted during the year. 4.3.3.  The supporting documentation for an approved TOA cannot be used to justify another award,  i.e.  honorary,  NAA,  or  SASA.    Exception:    A  TOA  granted  in  conjunction  with  a rating-based  performance  award  will  use  the  same  supporting  documentation.    (See paragraph 4.1 of this publication.) 4.3.4.  TOAs cannot be issued in conjunction with a Quality Step Increase (QSI). 4.3.5.  Awarded time-off should be scheduled within 90 calendar days after the effective date of  the  award.      Employees  forfeit  any  time-off  not  used  within  one  year  from  the  effective date. 4.3.6.  TOAs must be carefully scheduled to avoid adversely affecting an employee who has an annual leave "use or lose" situation. 4.3.7.  Awarded time-off cannot be used to justify restoring forfeited annual leave. 4.3.8.  Employees may never convert a TOA to a cash payment. 4.3.9.  Employees  may  not  transfer  approved,  unused  time-off  when  they  transfer  from  the AF to another DoD component or to another Federal agency.  In addition, employees coming from another department or Federal agency may not transfer a TOA to the AF. 4.3.10.  Once awarded, an employee cannot be required to use their TOA on a date specified by a supervisor or higher official. 4.4.  Documenting  Time-Off.  A  TOA  must  be  fully  supported  with  appropriate  written justification.  Refer to paragraph 2.6 of this publication to complete the nomination process. 4.4.1.  On an AF Form 1768 or eSSS include the following certification statement from the supervisor  or  recommending  official:  "I  have  considered  fully  the  wage  costs  and productivity  loss  in  granting  this  time-off  award.    The  amount  of  time-off  granted  is commensurate  with  the  individual’s  contribution  or  accomplishment.    I  also  considered  the unit's  workload  and  unit  employees’  leave  projections  and  certify  that  the  employee  can schedule the time-off in addition to other scheduled leave.  I also considered other available forms of recognition in determining the amount of this time-off award." 4.4.2.  Include the approving official's name, position title, signature and date signed, as well as those of the recommending official, as appropriate. 4.4.3.

The reverse of the medal is inscribed with "On Behalf of a Grateful Nation" with a space for the recipient's name to be inscribed.  The laurel wreath represents honor and high achievement.  The ribbon is red, white and blue.  The red stripes  commemorate  valor  and  sacrifice.    The  wide  blue  stripe  represents  strength.

Eligibility.  The medal shall be awarded to DoD civilian employees who on or after September 11, 2001 to a date to be determined, participate abroad in direct support of a US military  GWOT  operation  in  a  designated  geographic  location  approved  for  award  of  the military Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal (GWOT-E), to include service in the countries of Iraq and Afghanistan.   40  AFI36-1004  29 AUGUST 2016 Figure 6.2.  GWOT-C.  6.3.2.1.  Civilian employees must be engaged in direct support of a military operation in a combat  zone  in  an  area  of  eligibility  under  one  of  the  following  conditions:    1)  For  30 consecutive days; 2) For the full period, if the operation is  less than 30 days; 3) For 60 non-consecutive  days  in  a  combat  zone  provided  this  support  involves  the  employee entering the area(s) of eligibility; 4) Regardless of time, if the civilian employee is killed or medically evacuated from the area of eligibility while providing direct support in the designated operation. 6.3.2.2.  Under  no  circumstances  are  personnel  physically located in  the  US  eligible  for the GWOT-C medal even if they are engaged in direct support.  Direct support is defined as services provided to participating military activities of the Armed Forces in a military operation awarded the GWOT-E, but only if the employee actually enters the designated area of eligibility combat zone. 6.3.2.3.  The  area(s)  of  eligibility  are  the  same  as  designated  for  approved  GWOT-E military operations, and includes service in the countries of Afghanistan and Iraq; foreign territory  on  which  military  troops  have  actually  landed  or  are  present  and  specifically deployed for operations; adjacent water areas in which ships are operating, patrolling, or providing direct support of the operation; and the air space above and adjacent to the area in  which  operations  are  being  conducted.    The  Chairman,  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff,  will determine  the  US  military  operations  that  qualify  for  the  GWOT-E.    The  current list  of military  operations  authorized  the  GWOT-E  can  be  found  on  AFPC’s  website (http://www.afpc.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=7812)  or  obtained  from the Military Personnel Flights. 6.3.3.  Limitations  on  Awarding  the  Medal.    The  medal  may  be  awarded  only  to  DoD civilian  employees  and  only  for  operations  awarded  the  GWOT-E,  Afghanistan  Campaign Medal or Iraq Campaign Medal for military personnel. 6.3.3.1.  A DoD civilian employee is an individual meeting the definition of “employee” (refer to  para  2.4)  and who  would  be  eligible  for  awards  under  DoDI  1400.25,  Volume 451, Awards, including employees of nonappropriated activities. 6.3.3.2.  The GWOT-C may not be awarded to contract personnel. 6.3.3.3.  The GWOT-C may be awarded only once to a civilian employee for service to a GWOT military operation.  An employee may not be awarded both the GWOT-C and the AFI36-1004  29 AUGUST 2016   41  Armed  Forces  Civilian  Service  Medal  for  the  same  operation.  A  contribution  to  or support  of  a  GWOT  military  operation  by  employees  assigned  to  remotely  located activities,  (e.g.,  outside  the  areas  of  eligibility),  is  not  justification  for  award  of  the GWOT-C.  Such performance or contribution, if merited, may be acknowledged by other appropriate recognition. 6.3.3.3.1.  Example: If an employee was awarded a GWOT-C for Operation Enduring Freedom  (OEF),  a  civilian  employee  may  not  receive  an  additional  GWOT-C  for service  in  subsequent  GWOT  military  operations.  Only  one  GWOT-C  medal  is authorized per contingency operations as defined by DoD. 6.3.4.  Posthumous  Award.    The  GWOT-C  may  be  awarded  and  may  be  presented  to  a representative of the deceased employee’s family. 6.3.5.  Approval.  The  servicing  CPS  will  verify  entitlement  to  the  GWOT-C  using Contingency/Exercise/Deployment  orders  with  paid travel  vouchers,  decoration citations/orders, or other documentation acceptable by the CPS.  Upon verification, the CPS will update employee’s personnel record. 6.3.6.  Monetary Amount. None. 6.3.7.  Award Description.  The statue of freedom represents the ultimate goal of operations in support of the GWOT.  The laurel branches symbolize honor and achievement.  The five stars allude to the military service, and the triangle, which is the traditional symbol of civilian service, denotes support.  The spears enclose and defend “Freedom” and allude to support for military  service.    The  ribbon,  medium  blue  is  the  color  associated  with  the  DoD.    Gold represents  excellence  and  achievement.    Black  and  red  symbolize  the  threat  and  danger  of terrorism.    Red,  White  and  Blue,  our  National  colors,  are  for  patriotism  and  the  love  of freedom.    The  medal  set  includes  a  medal  and  lapel  pin  which  is  available  through  the Defense  Supply  System  (NSN  8455-01-545-7149).    There  is  no  official  DoD  certificate  to accompany the medal.  An illustration of the medal is provided at Figure 6.2. 6.4.  Armed Forces Civilian Service Medal (AFCSM). 6.4.1.  Purpose.  To  recognize  the  contributions  and  accomplishments  of  the  DoD  civilian work force directly supporting the Armed Forces, whose members are engaged in designated military  operations  of  a  peacekeeping  or  prolonged  humanitarian  nature.

The Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, will determine the US military operations that qualify for the AFSM.  Military Personnel Flights can provide a current list of military operations for which the AFSM is authorized. 6.4.3.  Limitations  on  Awarding  the  Medal.  The  medal  may  be  awarded  only  to  DoD civilian employees and only for operations authorized the AFSM for military personnel.

A contribution to or support of an AFSM military operation by employees assigned  to  remotely  located  activities,  (e.g.,  outside  the  areas  of  eligibility),  is  not justification for award of the AFCSM.  Such performance or contribution, if merited, may be acknowledged  by  other  appropriate  recognition.  Award  of  the  AFCSM  does  not  preclude granting  other  awards  if  the  employee’s  contribution  to  the  designated  operation  is  as significant or extraordinary as to merit additional recognition. 6.4.4.
