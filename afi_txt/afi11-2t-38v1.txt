(T-2) 1.2.  Phases  of  Training:  (Note:  All  references  to  “days”  in  this  publication  are  to  “calendar days” unless specifically noted otherwise.): 1.2.1.  Initial  Qualification  Training  (IQT).  This  training  is  necessary  to  qualify  aircrew for duties in the T-38 aircraft. See Chapter 2 for IQT program requirements. 1.2.2.  Mission  Qualification  Training  (MQT).  This  training  is  necessary  to  qualify aircrew for specific unit mission or local area requirements. Training may be incorporated in MAJCOM-approved IQT syllabi. See Chapter 3 for MQT requirements. 1.2.3.  Continuation  Training  (CT).  This  training  is  necessary  for  qualified  aircrew  to maintain their assigned level of proficiency and/or increase flight qualifications. It provides minimum  ground  and  flight  training  event  requirements.  This  training  is  also  necessary  to develop the IP force and certify pilots in specific unit or local area requirements. Individual aircrew CT requirements are based on unit assignment as inexperienced or experienced. See Chapter 4 for CT program requirements. Using MAJCOMs will detail their CT program in their MAJCOM supplement. 4 AFI11-2T-38V1  1 SEPTEMBER 2017 1.2.3.1.  Experienced  or  Inexperienced  Designation.  Squadron  commanders  will designate all pilots as experienced or inexperienced, as follows: (T-2) 1.2.3.1.1.  Experienced  Aircrew.  For  the  purposes  of  this  instruction,  the  wing commander,  vice  wing  commander,  OG  commander,  deputy  OG  commander, squadron commander, and squadron operations officer are designated as experienced aircrew. Using MAJCOMs will include a definition of “experienced” aircrew in their MAJCOM  supplement.  (T-2)  Document  experienced  designation  on  the  AF  Form 4348 or unit certification document IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 2. (T-2) 1.2.3.1.2.  Inexperienced  Aircrew.  Aircrew  who  do  not  qualify  as  experienced  or who  are  not  certified  as  such  by  the  squadron  commander  are  considered inexperienced. Aircrew designated as inexperienced will progress through a program managed  by  the  flight  commander  to  develop  sound  flying  and  instructional  skills. (T-2) Flight commanders will tailor each program based on the aircrew’s past flying experience and performance during IQT and MQT. (T-2) No time limit is established to transition from inexperienced to experienced. 1.2.4.  Specialized/Certification Training.  This training is necessary to carry out the unit’s assigned  missions,  but  is  not  required  of  every  crewmember.  Examples  of  specialized training  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  stall  pilot,  and  functional  check  flight  (FCF)  pilot. Individuals selected for training will accomplish appropriate formal course training to certify in these specialized areas, or comply with locally developed syllabi and squadron-developed training programs IAW Chapter 5. 1.2.5.  Night Vision Goggles (NVG) Training.  NVG training is not authorized. (T-2). 1.3.  Training Concepts and Procedures: 1.3.1.  Squadron  commanders  will  ensure  training  programs  are  designed  to  achieve  the highest  degree  of  qualification  and  proficiency  consistent  with  flight  safety  and  resource availability.   (T-2) 1.3.2.  Unless  specifically  directed,  the  squadron  commander  will  determine  the  level  of supervision required to accomplish in-flight training. (T-2) 1.3.3.  IPs and flight lead-qualified squadron supervisors may allow any pilot to lead limited portions of a mission if the pilot has been appropriately briefed. This provision will only be used  to  allow  a  pilot  to  practice  events  in  which  he  or  she  is  already  qualified  or  to  help determine if a pilot is ready for an upgrade program. (T-2). In either case, the IP or squadron supervisor is responsible for the flight. (T-2). 1.3.4.  Units will complete training requirements during the appropriate training cycle except where  specifically  excepted.  (T-2).  Using  MAJCOMs  will  detail  the  training  cycle  in  their MAJCOM supplement. 1.4.  Training Records and Reports.  Units will: 1.4.1.  Maintain an aircrew training folder for each assigned or attached aircrew member. 1.4.1.1.  Once training that requires a certification is complete, the signed Form 4348 or unit  certification  document  becomes  the  source  document  for  the  completion  of  that training.  Once the signed AF  Form 4348 or unit certification document is  placed in  the AFI11-2T-38V1  1 SEPTEMBER 2017 5 training  folder,  corresponding  training  records  may  be  removed  at  the  unit’s  discretion. (T-2). 1.4.2.  Document aircrew training in Aviation Resource Management System (ARMS), using the forms specified in AFI 11-202, Volume 1. (T-2) Track the following information for all aircrew, as applicable: 1.4.2.1.  Ground training dates accomplished and expiration dates. (T-2) 1.4.2.2.  Flying hours by 7, 30, and 90 days, and cumulative totals IAW AFI 11-202 Vol 3. (T-2) 1.4.2.3.  Events  required,  by  total  accomplished  and  amount  remaining  for  the  training cycle. (T-2) 1.4.2.4.  Flying maneuver currency dates accomplished and expiration dates. (T-2) 1.4.3.  Units may specify additional training folder requirements. 1.5.  Sortie  Allocation  Guidance.  Units  will  use  the  following  guidance  to  determine  priority for unit training sortie allocation: 1.5.1.  Higher headquarters-directed missions and aerial events. (T-2) 1.5.2.  Deployment support. (T-2) 1.5.3.  Evaluations. (T-2) 1.5.4.  FCFs. (T-2) 1.5.5.  API-1 CT, including upgrade-directed support. (T-2) 1.5.6.  API-2 CT, if applicable. (T-2) 1.5.7.  API-6 CT. (T-2) 1.5.8.  API-8 CT. (T-2) 1.5.9.  Supervisory flights. (T-2) 1.5.10.  Flight Surgeon (FS) flying requirements. (T-2) 1.5.11.  Indoctrination flights. (T-2) 1.5.12.  Orientation flights. (T-2) 1.6.  Aircrew Graduate Evaluation Program.  Refer to the appropriate formal course syllabus or command directive for aircrew graduate evaluation procedures.

Refer to  the appropriate formal  course syllabus and AFI 11-202 Volume 1, as supplemented or command directive for PR procedures. 1.8.  Fuel Optimization.  It is the responsibility of all aircrew to optimize fuel to the maximum extent  possible.  (T-2).  Individual  crew  members  and  supervisors  at  all  levels  will  manage aviation  fuel  as  a  limited  commodity  and  precious  resource.  (T-2).  Fuel  optimization  will  be considered  throughout  all  phases  of  mission  planning  and  execution.  (T-2).  If  no  additional training can be completed, and/or negative training results from continued flying, the sortie will be terminated to conserve fuel. Desired training, not fuel conservation nor adherence to average 6 AFI11-2T-38V1  1 SEPTEMBER 2017 sortie duration will be the driving factor of whether to land the aircraft or continue the mission. (T-2). AFI11-2T-38V1  1 SEPTEMBER 2017 7 Chapter 2 INITIAL QUALIFICATION TRAINING (IQT) in education 2.1.  General  Information.  This  chapter  outlines  the  IQT  program  for  the  T-38.

When attendance is not practical or quotas are not available, units will request waivers from the MAJCOM/A3 to conduct in-unit qualification training, using formal school courseware. (T-1). announcement and training course (ETCA), available 2.1.1.  Upon  completion  of  the  IQT  program,  aircrew  will  be  qualified  IAW  AFI  11-202, Volume 2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation  Program;  and AFI 11-2T-38, Volume 2,  T-38 Aircrew Evaluation Criteria. (T-2). 2.1.2.  Except for unusual circumstances, aircrew members undergoing qualification training will receive  ground  and  flight  instruction with  minimum  interruption and complete training within the time specified by the syllabus. (T-2) Individuals are dedicated to training and are not utilized in unit jobs or other duties until the completion of training. (Exception: Students enrolled in Pilot Instructor Training (PIT) or PIT TI may serve as RSU observers after their instrument/qualification (I/Q)  check.)  Failure to  complete training within the specified time limit requires notifying the gaining wing commander of the aircrew’s name, grade, reason for delay, planned actions, and estimated completion date. (T-2). 2.1.3.  Completion of IQT qualifies pilots to act as pilot-in-command of the model (T-38A/B or  T-38C)  the  I/Q  evaluation  was  accomplished  in.  (T-2).  See  paragraph  2.6  of  this instruction for difference training guidance. 2.2.  Prerequisites.  For  listings  of  formal  training  courses  and  administrative  and  reporting requirements  see  the  ETCA.  The  formal  course  syllabi  list  waiver  authorities  for  course  entry prerequisites. Before entering IQT, each aircrew member must comply with prerequisites of the appropriate  formal  course  training  syllabus  and  AFI  11-202,  Volume  1.  (T-2)    In  addition,  all personnel  maintaining  flying  status  will  meet  the  physical  examination;  physiological  training; survival, evasion, resistance, and escape (SERE) training requirements in AFI 11-202, Volume 1; and centrifuge training IAW AFI 11-404, Centrifuge Training for High-G Aircrew, before flying. (T-2). 2.3.  Ground  Training.  Ground  training  will  follow  the  formal  course  syllabus  flow,  but  may be tailored to the individual’s background and experience as well as local conditions. For in-unit qualification  training,  commanders  will  obtain  and  use  current  formal  school  courseware,  if available. (T-2). 2.4.  Flying Training. 2.4.1.  Aircrew  in  IQT  will  fly  under  direct  IP  supervision  until  they  complete  the qualification evaluation. (T-2) 2.4.2.  Formal  course  syllabus  mission  objectives  and  tasks  are  minimum  requirements  for IQT.  (T-2)  Additional  training  is  available  within  the  constraints  of  the  formal  course 8 AFI11-2T-38V1  1 SEPTEMBER 2017 syllabus.  Pilots  may  satisfy  MQT  and  upgrade  training  requirements  during  IQT  if  the appropriate IP is available and the formal course training allows it. 2.5.  Basic Aircraft Requalification Training.  Follow the requalification guidance in AFI 11-202, Volume 1, and paragraphs 4.5.2 through  4.5.2.1.4 of this instruction. (T-2) 2.6.  Conversion  and/or  Difference  Qualification.  Conversion  qualification  follows  the guidance  in  this  chapter  and  the  formal  course  conversion  syllabus.  Difference  training  is authorized for pilots converting from the T-38C to the T-38A/B or vice-versa. MAJCOMs will provide difference training guidance. 2.7.  Multiple  Qualifications.  Qualification  in  more  than  one  mission  design  series  (MDS)  is authorized according to AFI 11-202, Volume 1. (Note: Multiple qualifications are not authorized for  general  officers.)  Multiple  qualifications  require  completion  of  IQT  as  specified  in  this chapter. (T-2) 2.8.  Senior  Officers.  Comply  with  guidance  provided  in  AFI  11-401,  Aviation  Management, and AFI 11-202, Volume 1, for senior officers (colonel selects and above). (T-2) Senior officer training will follow the appropriate formal course syllabus. (T-2). AFI11-2T-38V1  1 SEPTEMBER 2017 9 Chapter 3 MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING (MQT) 3.1.  General.  Using MAJCOMs will determine MQT requirements. 10 AFI11-2T-38V1  1 SEPTEMBER 2017 Chapter 4 CONTINUATION TRAINING (CT) 4.1.  General Information. 4.1.1.  This  chapter  outlines  minimum  ground  and  flying  training  requirements  for  T-38 aircrew CT. There are two aspects of CT. The first consists of aircrew training in the basic flying  skills,  which  ensures  safe  operation  of  the  aircraft.  The  second  consists  of  specific mission-related  training  required  to  accomplish  the  unit's  assigned  missions  or  taskings. Taskings  may  be  locally  generated  or  higher  headquarters  directed.  All  CT  will  be maintained in the ARMS database IAW AFI 11-202 Volume 1 and AFI 11-421. Completion and  tracking  of  continuation  training  is  ultimately  the  responsibility  of  the  individual crewmember.  Using  MAJCOMs  will  define  additional  currencies  and  requirements  in  their MAJCOM supplement. 4.1.2.  Instructor  Development  (ID)  sorties  are  flown  to  develop  IP  instructional  skills, enhance basic flying proficiency, and help meet  currency requirements.  These sorties allow inexperienced IPs to learn and refine techniques while flying with experienced IPs. 4.2.  Training  Cycle.  Using  MAJCOMs  will  define  the  training  cycles  in  their  MAJCOM supplement. 4.3.  CT Administration: 4.3.1.  Quarterly CT Meetings: 4.3.1.1.  Squadron  commanders  will  direct  and  supervise  quarterly  CT  meetings  for aircrew  members.  (T-2)  The  purpose  of  these  meetings  is  to  discuss  standardization, safety, mission-related topics, instructional techniques, grading practices, and to increase general  knowledge.  A  CRM  topic  or  scenario  should  be  discussed  in  each  CT  meeting referring  to  core  concepts  from  AFI  11-290,  Cockpit/Crew  Resource  Management Training Program. 4.3.1.2.  Attendance  at  CT  meetings  is  mandatory.  The  unit  will  determine  a  method  to track attendance as part of the go/no-go process for flight. (T-2) Individuals not available for CT meetings will read the meeting minutes or be briefed by an operations supervisor before their first flight of the next quarter. (T-2) 4.3.2.  Requirements.  MAJCOMs  may  add  to  the  minimum  annual  or  semi-annual requirements  listed  in  this  chapter.    Sorties  and  events  accomplished  during  MQT  may  be credited toward CT requirements (ground and flying events) for the training cycle in which they  were  accomplished.  Before  an  aircrew  member  who  fails  to  meet  minimum  CT requirements  may  fly  in  the  new  training  cycle,  the  OG/CC  will  determine  if  additional training is required. (T-2). (Note: Additional training may be required, depending on the type and magnitude of the deficiency.) 4.3.2.1.  CT  Profiles.  Squadron  commanders  will  approve  profiles  for  all  required  CT sorties.  (T-2).  Profiles  will  detail  the  minimum  events  and  currency  items  to  be accomplished  on  the  sortie  (T-2)  (for  example,  aircraft  handling  characteristics  [AHC] maneuvers, approaches, or emergency patterns and landings). AFI11-2T-38V1  1 SEPTEMBER 2017 11 4.3.3.  Prorating  End-of-Cycle  Requirements.  At  the  end  of  the  training  cycle,  the squadron commander may prorate training requirements for aircrew members who were not available for flying duties according to AFI 11-202, Volume 1. 4.3.3.1.  Prorate only to adjust for genuine circumstances of training non-availability, not to mask training or planning deficiencies. (T-2) 4.3.3.2.  Base prorating on consecutive days of nonflying in the training cycle and apply it  separately  for  each  period  of  nonflying.  Use  the  prorating  allowance  in  AFI  11-202, Volume  1  to  determine  the  number  of  months  to  be  prorated  based  on  each  period  of consecutive calendar days of nonflying. (T-2) 4.3.3.3.  If  IQT  is  re-accomplished,  restart  the  individual’s  training  cycle  at  a  prorated share following IQT completion. (T-2) 4.3.3.4.  Round  off  prorated  numbers  resulting  in  fractions  of  less  than  1/2  to  the  next lower whole number, but prorate no requirement below 1. (T-2) 4.3.3.5.  For  prorating  purposes,  newly  assigned  or  converted  aircrew  and  aircrew achieving qualification after the 15th of the month are considered to be in CT on the first day  of  the  following  month.  Events  and  sorties  for  the  remainder  of  the  training  cycle may be prorated. (T-2) 4.3.4.  Failure to Complete Annual and Semiannual CT Requirements: 4.3.4.1.  Aircrew members who fail to maintain training requirements according to Table 4.1,  Table  4.2,  additional  MAJCOM  flying  or  ground  requirements  and  minimum mission ready (MR), basic mission capable (BMC) or basic aircraft qualification (BAQ) CT requirements according to AFI 11-202 Volume 1, will be placed in non-mission ready (NMR) or non-basic aircraft qualified (N-BAQ) status as applicable. (T-2) They will not fly in the new training cycle until a review is completed by the OG/CC to determine the cause  of  the  deficiency  and  whether  additional  training  is  required  before  regaining training status. (T-2) 4.3.5.  Multiple  Qualifications.  MAJCOMs  will specify  which sorties and events  flown in other  aircraft  may  be  used  to  satisfy  T-38  sortie,  event,  and  currency  requirements  in  their MAJCOM supplement. 4.4.  Minimum  Training  Requirements.  Training  accomplished  during  IQT,  MQT,  TI,  and BIP  training  may  be  credited  toward  CT  requirements  for  the  training  cycle  in  which  it  was accomplished.  AFI  11-202,  Volume  1,  and  Table  4.1  establish  aircrew  minimum  training requirements.  Using  MAJCOMs  may  specify  additional  ground  training  requirements  in  their MAJCOM supplement.

For example, if last accomplished 10 Jan 16, expires on 31 Jan 17, overdue on 1 Feb 17.  3. See paragraph 4.3.4.1. 4. For multiple-qualified T-38 pilots, accomplishment of annual CRM CT in their primary aircraft AFI11-2T-38V1  1 SEPTEMBER 2017 13 fulfills the T-38 annual CRM CT requirement in this table. For Flight Surgeons, CRM is a one-time requirement in the primary assigned aircraft. 5. This is a one-time requirement for MAJCOM examiners who visit field units TDY.  Once accomplished on the initial TDY at each location, this training is current for the duration of the MAJCOM examiner’s headquarters tour. 6. Units required to conduct routine over-water flights will maintain water survival training (WST) currency. An over-water flight is defined as a flight in which the aircraft is flown outside the safe glide ratio to land at any time during the flight. Aircrew non-current in WST must accomplish WST prior to conducting over-water flight.  Reference AFI 16-1301. 7. Personnel arriving from permanent change of station (PCS) or temporary duty (TDY) during a period when water survival training is not available (i.e., winter months, pool unavailable) are automatically granted an exception to this requirement until 60 days following the first available training date. However, individuals will attend the academic portions of training at the earliest opportunity.  Reference AFI 16-1301. 8. All pilots on active flying status must complete the IRC every fourth quarter after completion IAW this instruction, AFI 11-202 Vol 1, and MAJCOM guidance. For example, if this training is completed in the first quarter of the year (Jan, Feb or Mar), it must be completed no later than the first quarter of the following year.
