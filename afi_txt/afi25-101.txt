Overview.  Air Force WRM consists of an enterprise managed global strategy, dynamically positioned, equipment, vehicles and consumables, to support operations across the full Range of Military  Operations  (ROMO).    It  enables  the  Air  Force  Forces  (AFFOR)  to  reduce  the  time required to achieve an operational capability and/or produce an operational effect. 1.2.  Definitions. 1.2.1.  DoDI 3110.06, War Reserve Materiel Policy, defines WRM as war materiel to reduce reaction  time  and  to  sustain  forces;  WRM  stocks  shall  be  sized,  acquired,  managed,  and positioned  to  maximize  flexibility  in  support  of  Guidance  for  Development  of  the  Force, while minimizing the Department of Defense (DoD) investment in inventories. 1.2.1.1.  Starter Stock.  Starter stocks are WRM stocks pre-positioned in or near a theater of operations, and are designed to last until resupply at wartime rates is established. 1.2.1.2.  Swing  Stock.    Swing  stocks  are  WRM  stocks  positioned  ashore  or  afloat  for meeting war reserve requirements of more than one contingency in more than one theatre of  operation.  Swing  stocks  will  be  used  to  complement  starter  stocks  as  a  follow-on source of supply in a regional contingency. 1.2.2.  CJCSI  4310.01C,  Logistics  Planning  Guidance  for  Global  Pre-Positioned  Materiel Capability,  establishes  logistics  planning  guidance  for  Global  Pre-positioned  materiel capabilities for utilization during a full spectrum of contingency operations during peacetime and/or wartime periods. 1.2.3.  WRM is packaged capability Unit Type Codes (UTC).  These capability packages are composed of equipment, vehicles, consumables, munitions, and medical resources.  Medical and munitions WRM are managed by their separate functional areas, as are their applicable policies  and  directives.  WRM  consumables  include  tanks,  racks,  adapters  and  pylons (TRAP), bulk Petroleum, Oils and Lubricants (POL), rations, and engines. 1.2.3.1.  Air  Force  WRM  Program,  combines  capability  into  three  critical  operational support  areas.    They  are:  Flightline  Support  (FS),  Personnel  Support  (PS),  and Infrastructure Support (IS).  Within these support areas, there are three sets of capability.  The three sets of capability are: 1.2.3.1.1.  Basic  Expeditionary  Airfield  Resources  (BEAR)  capability  aligns  to provide  FS,  IS,  and  PS.    BEAR  capability  has  no  peacetime  or  mobility  equipment equivalent within the USAF. 1.2.3.1.2.  Fuels  Support  Equipment  (FSE)  aligns  to  provide  FS.    Note:  Fuels Operational Readiness Capability Equipment (FORCE) is the WRM portion of FSE. FORCE  capability  has  no  peacetime  or  mobility  equipment  equivalent  within  the USAF. 1.2.3.1.3.  WRM  equipment  and  consumable  capabilities  aligned  to  provide  FS  and IS. 1.3.  Capabilities Based Requirements Determination.   6  AFI25-101  14 JANUARY 2015 1.3.1.  AFPD  10-6,  Capability  Requirements  Development,  and  Air  Force  Instruction  (AFI) 10-601,  Operational  Capability  Requirements  Development,  establishes  the  guidelines, policies,  and  procedures  for  defining,  developing,  documenting,  validating,  approving  and managing AF operational  capability  requirements.  These publications will  be used to  form the basis of the WRM program’s capability-based requirements.  The resulting requirements will be used to develop the inputs to the Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution (PPBE) process. 1.3.2.  AFPD  90-11,  Strategic  Planning  System,  defines  the  Air  Force  Strategic  Planning System as a strategic analysis process. This policy and guidance will be applied to the WRM program to develop a global capability directly supporting the ROMO. 1.3.3.  The  WRM  requirements  determination  process,  will  result  in  updates  to  the  global strategy, updates to the distribution of capability and gap analysis to determine the adequacy. The  process  will  define  shortages  and  determine  excess  capability,  as  well  as  the prioritization of requirements. The process results will drive acquisition, modernization, and Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) priorities. 1.4.  Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution (PPBE). 1.4.1.  The  PPBE  process  consists  of  four  distinct  but  overlapping  processes.    The  first process (Planning) requires the Capability Based Requirements Determination Process.  The results are submitted as part of the development of the Combat Support (CS) Core Function Master Plan.  The second process  is  programming for specific capability  and is  done at  the Headquarters  Air  Force  and  MAJCOM  levels.  The  third  and  fourth  parts  (Budgeting  and Execution)  are  determined  by  specific  roles  and  responsibilities  at  all  levels  to  ensure accountability and consistency with the requirements determination processes. AFI25-101  14 JANUARY 2015   7  Chapter 2 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES  2.1.
