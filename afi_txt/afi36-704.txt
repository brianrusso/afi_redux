The CPF:••Serves as the primary local source of authoritative information and interprets policy and pro-cedures concerning civilian discipline and adverse actions.Shares  responsibility  with  managers  to  ensure  that  such  actions  comply  with  governingrequirements.• Coordinates written notices of proposed actions and final decisions before delivery to employ-ees.NOTE: Although not required, the Air Force recommends that supervisors seek advice from a CPF rep-resentative before administering an oral admonishment.6.2.  The office of the staff judge advocate reviews notices of proposed adverse actions and notices offinal decisions for legal sufficiency.Section B—Administering Constructive Disciplinary and Adverse Actions7.  General Information. This section gives general guidance to supervisors and managers for the con-structive administering of disciplinary and adverse actions. It doesn't establish mandatory procedures.7.1.  Constructive Discipline. Maintaining discipline usually is not a problem within a work environ-ment where supervisors:• Establish, clearly communicate, and consistently enforce reasonable rules and standards ofconduct and performance.Set a good example.Identify  conduct  and  performance  that  needs  improvement  in  a  way  that  respects  theemployee's dignity.••• Treat employees fairly and encourage them to improve.• Recognize good performers.7.2.  Principles of Constructive Discipline. Constructive discipline is preventive in nature.  Theobjectives are to:• Develop, correct and rehabilitate employees.• Encourage employees to accept responsibility.•Prevent situations where no alternative to taking discipline exists.8AFI36-704   22 JULY 19947.3.  Carrying Out Constructive Discipline. When considering and taking disciplinary action,supervisors:7.3.1.  Investigate the alleged offense and consider all available relevant information.7.3.2.  Ensure that any action taken is fair, timely, and for good cause and that it complies withapplicable law, regulation and policy.7.3.3.  Ensure that disciplinary action contributes to the objective of constructive discipline inparagraph 7.2.7.3.4.  Conduct interviews and inquiries and discipline employees in private to minimize embar-rassment.7.3.5.  Involve the minimum number of people necessary when gathering facts and coordinatingactions.7.3.6.  Don't make information about disciplinary and adverse actions available to those outside ofmanagement circles or those that aren't affected by the action without the employee's consent.7.3.7.  Observe the employee's right to representation.  See paragraph 27. for guidance concerningthe employee's right to representation including, where applicable, the employee's right to unionrepresentation.7.3.8.  May not ask the employee to resign or retire to avoid discipline (see paragraph 9.).8.  Distinguishing Disciplinary From Nondisciplinary Situations. Improper identification of whethera cause of action is a disciplinary or nondisciplinary situation may lead to a failure to meet all require-ments.8.1.  A cause of action due to delinquency or misconduct personally attributable to the employee is adisciplinary situation.  Examples include on or off-duty misconduct, absence without approved leave,violation of leave procedures, etc.8.2.  A cause of action not due to an employee's delinquency or misconduct, but which is personal tothe employee, is a nondisciplinary situation. Examples include inefficiency, physical or mental inabil-ity to perform the duties of the position, or lack of work or funds necessitating a furlough, etc.9.  Voluntary Separation and Reductions.9.1.  Determine whether a separation or reduction in grade or pay is voluntary or involuntary based oneach set of circumstances.9.1.1.  Under most circumstances, voluntary actions include those that employees:• Are free to choose.• Clearly understand.• Are permitted a reasonable time period in which to choose a course of action.• Are permitted to set the effective date.9.1.1.1.  Supervisors may suggest another effective date for a voluntary action, but may notarbitrarily set an earlier or later date.AFI36-704   22 JULY 199499.1.2.  An employee confronted by supervisors with a potential disciplinary or adverse action maychoose to voluntarily:• Accept a reduction in grade or pay.• Resign.• Retire.9.1.2.1.  Supervisors may discuss these alternatives with employees but may not advise or askemployees to resign or retire.Section C—Disciplinary and Adverse Actions and Their Requirements10.  Governing Requirements. Supervisors and managers must respect employees' rights established bylaw, regulation, policy, or collective bargaining agreements.  Take disciplinary and adverse actions by:• Notifying employees of the proposed action.• Giving employees an opportunity to respond to proposed actions.• Notifying employees of the final decision.•Informing employees of their access to appellate or grievance procedures.Supervisors must accomplish disciplinary and adverse actions through written documents that meet spec-ified criteria.  EXCEPTIONS:  Supervisors need not document oral admonishments discussed in para-graph 11. or, where applicable, oral notices of proposed reprimands discussed in paragraph 12.4.4.10.1.  Standard for Taking Disciplinary and Adverse Actions: Managers and supervisors:10.1.1.  May take a disciplinary or adverse action only for such cause as will promote the effi-ciency of the service.10.1.2.  May not take a disciplinary or adverse action against an employee on the basis of any ofthe reasons prohibited by 5 U.S.C. 2302.10.2.  Burden of Proof:10.2.1.  In order to meet the standard for taking an action, managers and supervisors must:• Clearly specify the charges or reasons upon which the action is based.• Be able to prove the specific charges or reasons which form the basis for the action by apreponderance of the evidence.• Be able to show the connection or “nexus” between the charges and the impact on the effi-ciency of the Air Force.• Be able to show that the penalty imposed was appropriate under the circumstances (seeparagraph 32.).10.2.2.  Harmful Error. If harmful error is alleged in an appeal or grievance, the burden is uponthe appellant or grievant to show that -- based upon the record as a whole -- the error was harmful(i.e., the outcome would probably have been different absent the error).10AFI36-704   22 JULY 199410.3.  Applying Requirements. Managers ensure that disciplinary and adverse actions comply withall legal and regulatory requirements.10.3.1.  Third party review may find actions that don't comply with governing requirements defec-tive, either procedurally or on merit or both. The third party may reverse the action or reduce theseverity of the action.10.3.2.  An action that is not sustained by a third party because of a harmful error in proceduresmay be initiated again if the Air Force corrects the deficiency.  An action may not be initiatedagain if the third party's modification or reversal is based on the merits of the case.11.  Oral Admonishment.11.1.  Supervisors:11.1.1.  Issue oral admonishments to correct minor misconduct or delinquency or to motivateemployees to improve their work habits, work methods, or behavior.11.1.2.  Note the date they issue an oral admonishment on the employee's AF Form 971, Supervi-sor's Employee Brief.11.1.2.1.  Delete the reference to the admonishment 2 years after the effective date.11.2.  The Relationship of Oral Admonishment to Other Disciplinary Actions. An oral admon-ishment is informal and the least severe penalty enforced in the Air Force discipline program.  Oraladmonishments are disciplinary actions but not adverse actions.  See paragraph 37.3. for an explana-tion of the use of oral admonishments in relation to Attachment 3.11.3.  Difference From Performance Discussions or Counseling Sessions. Performance discus-sions and counseling sessions are nondisciplinary.  Use them to guide, encourage, or instruct employ-ees (see AFI 36-1001).11.4.  Steps In Considering and Taking an Oral Admonishment. This paragraph sets out recom-mended steps for supervisors to follow when imposing an oral admonishment for an employee's mis-conduct or delinquency.  These steps are not mandatory unless stated as such.  EXCEPTION:  Followa collective bargaining agreement if it gives other instructions.  Supervisors:11.4.1.  Observe employee representation entitlements according to paragraph 27.11.4.2.  Gather available facts.11.4.3.  Interview employees privately.  Tell them the purpose of the interview.  State the problemand the facts so they can clearly understand.11.4.4.  Give employees an opportunity to answer and express their views on the matter.  Ifemployees request reasonable time for thought before responding, honor the request, if possible.11.4.5.  Consider employees' answers and any explanations offered.11.4.6.  Resolve any outstanding questions before making a decision. Advise employees that youwill issue a decision as soon as possible and that you will tell them when you do.11.4.7.  Determine appropriate action:11.4.7.1.  If the discussion satisfactorily resolves the matter, tell the employees.  Take no fur-ther action.AFI36-704   22 JULY 19941111.4.7.2.  If the discussion doesn't satisfactorily resolve the matter and you decide to issue anoral admonishment, tell the employees and explain why. Tell the employees that they are beingdisciplined by receipt of an oral admonishment.  Identify areas where employees needimprovement, suggest how they may do so, and offer to help.11.4.8.  Document the admonishment on AF Form 971.  Include:• The words "oral admonishment" to distinguish the action from nondisciplinary counsel-ing.• A brief description of the reason for the admonishment.• The effective date.• A note that you advised the employee of the admonishment.11.4.9.  Ask the employee to initial AF Form 971.  See the requirements for recording and deletingreferences to oral admonishments in paragraphs 11.1.2. and 11.1.3.NOTE: Employees' initials on AF Form 971 show their awareness of the oral admonishment, not theiragreement.11.4.10.  Follow up on oral admonishments by offering help, making suggestions, and encourag-ing the employee to improve.  Note these follow-up actions and any improvement in employees'conduct on AF Form 971.12.  Reprimand.12.1.  Purpose and Use. Supervisors and managers use reprimands to correct significant misconductor delinquency and repeated lesser offenses.  It is a severe disciplinary action that should be adequatefor many disciplinary situations requiring an action more severe than an oral admonishment.12.1.1.  Supervisors make sure written reprimands are clearly identified with the subject:  "Noticeof Reprimand."12.1.2.  Supervisors send a copy of the "Notice of Reprimand" to the CPF for temporary filing inthe employee's Standard Form 66, Official Personnel Folder (OPF), for 2 years from the date ofthe reprimand.  The CPF destroys it when the 2 years expire.12.1.3.  Supervisors note the date they issue a reprimand on the employee's AF Form 971.  Deletethe note when the reprimand expires.12.1.4.  In the establishment of a progression of penalties (see paragraph  34.), supervisors maymake a reprimand more "severe" by:• Referencing previous offenses;•Indicating the seriousness of their concern with the continued misconduct or delinquency;or• Warning that a further offense could result in a more severe penalty.  Note: Be sure to usethe phrase, "could result" rather than "will result. "12.1.5.  Supervisors may issue a reprimand as the last step in a progression of penalties if the writ-ten notice clearly warns that a further offense could lead to removal.12AFI36-704   22 JULY 199412.2.  The Relationship of Reprimands To Other Disciplinary Actions:12.2.1.  A reprimand is the least severe formal penalty.  It is a disciplinary action but not anadverse action.  It carries the same weight as a suspension when it is used as a prior offense pen-alty to support the penalty imposed for a later offense.12.2.2.  Reprimands may constitute a more severe penalty when:• Air Force policy precludes the use of suspension.• A suspension might be managerially unsound even though the offense is serious enough towarrant suspension.• The offense doesn't warrant suspension but meets the criteria in paragraph 12.1.4.12.3.  Difference From Letters Stating Standards or Requirements.12.3.1.  Don't use letters documenting standards of conduct as disciplinary actions or reprimands.12.3.2.  Don't use letters that establish special requirements, such as letters outlining leaveapproval procedures or warning employees of the potential consequences of certain delinquencies,as reprimands.12.3.3.  Use reprimands to discipline employees who have been advised of management's expec-tations but fail to meet them for reasons within their control.  Supervisors may restate theserequirements in letters of reprimand.12.4.  Steps In Considering and Taking a Reprimand. This paragraph sets out recommended stepsfor supervisors to follow when imposing a reprimand for an employee's misconduct or delinquency.The steps are not mandatory unless stated as such.  EXCEPTION:  Follow a collective bargainingagreement if it gives other instructions.  Supervisors:12.4.1.  Complete the steps in this paragraph as soon and efficiently as possible but not necessarilyduring one session.12.4.2.  Observe employees' right to representation according to paragraph 27.12.4.3.  Gather available facts.12.4.4.  Interview employees privately.  Tell them the purpose of the interview.  State the problemand the facts so they can clearly understand.  If applicable, tell employees the interview serves asan oral notice of proposed reprimand.NOTE: Unless a governing collective bargaining agreement provides otherwise, supervisors must giveemployees a notice of proposed reprimand. The notice may be given orally or in writing.12.4.5.  Give employees an opportunity to answer and express their views on the matter.  Ifemployees request reasonable time for thought before answering, honor the request, if possible.Follow the guidelines in paragraph 28.12.4.6.  Consider employees' answers and any explanations they offer according to paragraph 29.12.4.7.  Resolve any outstanding questions before making a decision. Advise employees that youwill issue a decision as soon as possible and that you will tell them when you do.12.4.8.  Determine appropriate action:AFI36-704   22 JULY 19941312.4.8.1.  If the discussion satisfactorily resolves the matter, tell the employees.  Take no fur-ther action.12.4.8.2.  If the discussion doesn't satisfactorily resolve the matter and you decide an oraladmonishment is adequate penalty under the circumstances, take the steps outlined in para-graphs 11.4.7. through 11.4.10.12.4.8.3.  If the discussion does not satisfactorily resolve the matter and you decide a repri-mand might be warranted, tell employees that you have not made a decision but will tell themwhen you do so.12.4.8.4.  If, after discussing the case with the CPF, you decide to reprimand the employee,prepare a "Notice of Reprimand" and coordinate it with the CPF before delivering it to theemployee.  Note: This notice is required. See paragraphs 17.5. and 17.6. concerning thenotice contents.12.4.8.5.  Send documentation of the action to the CPF according to paragraphs 12.1.2. and 20.12.4.8.6.  Note the reprimand on the AF Form 971 according to paragraph 12.1.3.13.  Suspensions:13.1.  Purpose and Use:13.1.1.  Consider a suspension, regardless of its duration, as an adverse action.  Use it as a severedisciplinary action.  Ordinarily, it is the final step in the disciplinary process before removal actionand is accompanied by a warning to employees that a further violation of rules could result inremoval.  Note: Be sure to state the warning in terms of "could" rather than "will" result inremoval. 13.1.2.  A suspension prevents an employee from performing work and denies salary for the sus-pension period.  Therefore, supervisors may not impose a suspension for indebtedness or for per-formance-related factors in nondisciplinary situations.13.1.3.  Normally, you shouldn't suspend employees for more than 30 days.13.2.  Suspensions for 14 Days or Less. When proposing a suspension for 14 days or less, supervi-sors must provide employees:• Advance  written  notice  stating  the specific reasons for the proposed  action  (see  paragraph16.).• A reasonable time, but not less than 24 hours, to answer charges orally and in writing and tofurnish affidavits and other documentary evidence in support of their answer.• The right to representation by an attorney or other representative (see paragraph 27.).• A written decision and the specific reasons for the decision at the earliest practicable date (seeparagraph 17.).13.2.1.  Normally, supervisors give employees 7 days to answer a proposed suspension for 14 daysor less.13.3.  Suspensions for More Than 14 days. See paragraph 14.4. for requirements for suspensionsfor more than 14 days.14AFI36-704   22 JULY 199414.  Removal, Suspension for More Than 14 Days, Reduction in Grade or Pay, or Furlough for 30Days or Less.14.1.  These actions include:• Actions based solely on factors unrelated to performance.• Actions based on factors both related and unrelated to performance.• Actions based solely on factors related to performance that aren't covered by AFI 36-1001.NOTE: See paragraph 15. for special procedures when a reduction in grade is based on reclassification orjob-grading determinations.14.2.  Removal. A disciplinary removal is the most severe disciplinary action. Consider it rehabilita-tive since it could help employees improve their performance in future positions.14.2.1.  Before initiating a removal, carefully review the facts and circumstances in each case.Make sure they support the conclusion that the employee has demonstrated unwillingness orrefusal to conform to the rules of conduct or has so breached the employee-employer relationshipthat other rehabilitation is not appropriate and removal is warranted for the offense.14.2.2.  Supervisors and managers may remove an employee:••For misconduct on or off the job.  (See paragraph 10.2.1.).For actions before appointment which reflect upon the employee's suitability for federalemployment.14.2.3.  Normally, supervisors take a progression of disciplinary measures before deciding toremove employees.  EXCEPTION:  If employees commit egregious misconduct or flagrantly vio-late rules and regulations, supervisors may remove them for a first or second offense.14.3.  Furlough for 30 Days or Less. For a furlough of any duration, managers must apply for priorapproval from HQ USAF/DPC.  Don't announce a proposed furlough before getting it approved.14.3.1.  Submit requests through command channels and include:• The reasons you consider a furlough necessary.• The efforts you made to avoid the furlough.• The number of employees involved, their skills, and the proposed length of the furlough.14.4.

Supervi-sors may deliver notices either personally or by mail.19.1.  Normally, supervisors, or their designees, hand notices to employees and ask them to sign onecopy, acknowledging receipt.  Should an employee refuse to sign the acknowledgement copy, the per-son making the delivery can sign and date a statement of delivery to include the place, date, and timeof delivery, and note the employee's refusal to sign.  Note: The employee's written acknowledgementdoesn't indicate agreement with the notice. 19.2.  If personal delivery is impossible for some reason, supervisors must chose a method of maildelivery.

Don't proposethe most severe action with the expectation that it may later be reduced.22.2.  When an adverse action results in pay reduction, state the employee's new salary in the notice.For a change to a lower grade, state the employee's exact pay plan, series, position title, and grade.  Ifan employee doesn't qualify for grade retention, state whether the employee is entitled to pay reten-tion.23.  Specific Reasons (Includes Causes of Action). In the notice of proposed action, state all the spe-cific reasons relied on to support the proposed action.  (For reprimands, include this information in thenotice of reprimand unless a written notice of proposed reprimand was issued.)  Supervisors need notinclude every reason that might have been used to support their proposed action.23.1.  Normally, cover the current cause of action in the introductory paragraph of the notice of pro-posed action.  Include supporting reasons (such as prior offenses) in separate paragraphs.23.2.  The supervisor who initiates the action must identify and state the cause of action.  Causes foradverse action may be reasons personal to the employee such as on or off-the-job misconduct, delin-quency, or physical or mental inability to perform the duties of the position.  Causes also may beimpersonal reasons such as the application of new or revised classification standards or the need tocorrect a merit promotion error.24.  Adding Reasons. If supervisors amend a notice to add further reasons for action, they must giveemployees sufficient time to answer the added reasons and take no action until the required notice periodexpires.  Note: The advance notice period starts again from the date the added reasons are received bythe employee. 25.  Material Relied on To Support the Action. Supervisors assemble the material they relied on tosupport the reasons for the proposed action and make the file available to the employee. This material mayinclude:•• Documents.•• Relevant material concerning any previous record or action that serves as the basis for the currentInvestigative reports or extracts from the reports.Statements of witnesses.action.AFI36-704   22 JULY 19942125.1.

Supervisors must allow employees, the employee's representative, or the employee's designatedphysician under 5 CFR 297.205 to review all supporting material.  Don't use material to support yourreasons for the action that can't be shown to these individuals.26.  The Official to Whom Employees Answer. Normally, the person who signs the notice of final deci-sion receives employees' oral or written answers.  Managers may designate another person to receive theanswer as long as that person has the authority to recommend a final decision and serves in a positionsuperior to the employee (not necessarily in a supervisory position or in a higher grade), or a designatedCPF official (see paragraph 5.2.2.).27.  Employee Representation.27.1.  Supervisors and managers must give a union representative of an appropriate bargaining unitthe opportunity to be represented at any examination of an employee in the unit by a representative ofthe agency in connection with an investigation if:• The employee reasonably believes the examination may result in disciplinary action againstthe employee and;• The employee requests representation.27.2.

Designated officials to receive employees'answers to notices of proposed actions consider an employee's attempt to obtain appellate or grievancereconsideration of a proposed action to be an answer to the notice of proposed action.30.1.  Employees may contest final decisions that have gone into effect by filing a timely appeal orgrievance.31.  Appeal and Grievance Rights. Disciplinary actions and adverse actions are subject to review underthe procedures of the MSPB, the Department of Defense (DoD), the Air Force, or negotiated grievanceprocedures between the Air Force and exclusive collective bargaining units, as applicable.  Writtennotices of final decision contain specific information about those rights; and, if alternatives exist, theemployee is required to select the procedure to be used.  Some general rules are included below; butbecause not all employees have the same appellate or grievance rights, an employee who has received anotice of final decision should carefully review the appellate or grievance information in it and may askCPF assistance on specific questions.31.1.  Oral Admonishments, Reprimands, and Suspension for 14 Days or Less. Bargaining unitemployees with access to a negotiated grievance procedure may grieve those actions through that pro-cedure only.31.1.1.  Bargaining unit employees without access to a negotiated grievance procedure and non-bargaining unit employees may grieve such actions through the DoD grievance procedure in DoD-CPM 1400.25-M, Chapter 7, Subchapter 13, Administrative Grievance System.31.2.

An employee not included in paragraphs 31.2.1.1. through 31.2.1.6., but who has receivedan action covered by 31.2., may grieve such action through the DoD grievance procedure in DoD-CPM 1400.25-M, Chapter 7, Subchapter 13, Administrative Grievance System, unless that proce-dure excludes either the employee or the action being grieved from its coverage.Section F—Selection of Appropriate Disciplinary Actions.32.  Penalty Selection. Supervisors determine which penalty to impose in a particular situation by apply-ing responsible judgement to Air Force disciplinary policy. Take the disciplinary action on the basis ofconclusions that sufficient evidence is available to support the reasons for action and that the action iswarranted and reasonable in terms of the circumstances which prompted it.32.1.  Governing Criteria. Supervisors observe the principle of "like penalties for like offenses inlike circumstances."  Apply penalties as consistently as possible considering the particular circum-stances of the cause for disciplinary action.32.1.1.  Don't apply penalties with "...mathematical rigidity or perfect consistency regardless ofvariations in circumstances or changes in prevailing regulations, standards, or mores," (Douglas v.Veterans Administration, et al., MSPB Decision No. AT075299006, 10 April 1981).32.1.2.  Supervisors consider all relevant penalty selection factors. Select penalties that aren't dis-proportionate to the offense and contribute to the solution of the problem and to the attainment ofan effective management environment.32.2.  Factors in Penalty Selection. Some of the factors that may be relevant in selecting the appro-priate penalty are listed at paragraphs 32.2.1. through 32.2.12.  Not all of the factors will be relevantin every case and others may be relevant in particular cases.  Selection of an appropriate penalty(including a reprimand) involves a responsible balancing of the relevant factors based on the individ-ual case.  Some of the relevant factors may weigh in the employee's favor while others may not or mayeven cause management to view the situation as more serious and deserving of a more severe penaltythan originally thought.  When selecting a penalty, supervisors and managers consider the followingfactors:32.2.1.  The nature and seriousness of the offense, and its relation to the employee's duties, posi-tion, and responsibilities, including whether the offense was intentional or technical or inadvert-ent, or was committed maliciously or for gain, or was frequently repeated.26AFI36-704   22 JULY 199432.2.2.  The employee's job level and type of employment, including supervisory or fiduciary role,contacts with the public, and prominence of the position.32.2.3.  The employee's past disciplinary record.32.2.4.  The employee's past work record, including length of service, performance on the job,ability to get along with fellow workers, and dependability.32.2.5.  The effect of the offense upon the employee's ability to perform at a satisfactory level andits effect upon supervisors' confidence in the employee's ability to perform assigned duties.32.2.6.  The consistency of the penalty with those imposed upon other employees for the same orsimilar offenses in like or similar circumstances.32.2.7.  The consistency of the penalty with the Guide to Disciplinary Actions (Attachment 3).32.2.8.  The notoriety of the offense or its impact upon the reputation of the Air Force.32.2.9.  The clarity with which the employee was on notice of any rules that were violated in com-mitting the offense, or had been warned about the conduct in question.32.2.10.  The potential for the employee's rehabilitation.32.2.11.  The mitigating circumstances surrounding the offense such as unusual job tensions, per-sonality problems, mental impairment, harassment, or bad faith, malice or provocation on the partof others involved in the matter.32.2.12.  The adequacy and effectiveness of alternative sanctions to deter such conduct in thefuture by the employee or others.32.3.  Penalty Support. If an employee grieves or appeals an action, supervisors and managers mustprepare to support the appropriateness of the penalty (see paragraph 10.2.1.).32.3.1.  Supervisors and managers must include a statement of their reasoning as to the appropri-ateness of the penalty imposed in the record described in paragraph 20.33.  The Guide To Disciplinary Actions (Attachment 3). The guide helps supervisors and managersselect appropriate penalties by providing a framework for interrelating all the relevant facts to possiblecourses of action and to available penalties.  Use it to evaluate causes of action (offenses), whether or notspecifically described, so that a sound, supportable penalty may be selected.  Avoid mechanical use of theguide.  The guide is an expression of typical causes and typical penalties only; therefore, causes of actionand penalties in the guide may not meet the demands of all situations.  Use it as guidance along withsupervisory judgment in considering the particular circumstances of the matter and the appropriateness ofthe particular action contemplated.33.1.  Cause of Action. The "Cause of Action" column in the guide explains many of the commonoffenses, but it does not include every possible one.  In using that column to apply general Air Forcepolicy, supervisors compare each cause of action in the particular case at hand to all of those describedand use those that relate to the situation.  If there is a corresponding cause of action shown in theguide, use it to guide further consideration.  If the cause of action in the particular case at hand is notshown, supervisors fit that offense into the general framework by relating its nature and seriousness tothe fundamental characters of those listed.  Supervisors need not use the precise language in the guideto describe an offense.AFI36-704   22 JULY 199433.2.  Typical Penalty.2733.2.1.  Unless specifically stated otherwise, the "Typical Penalty" column in the guide establishesa range of penalties for a particular or comparable offense, not a required one.  The guide pre-scribes no minimum penalty for any cause of action, except where required by law or executiveorder.  Supervisors may not establish a minimum penalty by policy statement or by implementinginstruction.  Unless restricted by law or executive order, supervisors and managers may impose nopenalty at all or may choose from penalties ranging from oral admonishment to removal.33.2.2.  When considering which offense column of the guide to use, supervisors and managersneed not establish that an employee's prior offenses were of the same character as the currentoffense.  The severity of the penalty depends on the relationship of the current offense to relevantfactors including those discussed in paragraph 32.2.  See Attachment 3 for further guidance onhow to determine the penalty.34.  Progression of Penalties. Supervisors and managers apply increasingly more severe penalties as theemployee continues to breach the employee-employer relationship. Such a progression establishes a con-structive disciplinary process (see paragraph 7.).34.1.  Supervisors usually begin a progression of penalties with oral admonishments and proceedthrough reprimand to suspension.  If employees continue not to meet their responsibilities, the super-visor may end the progression of penalties in removal.34.2.  For example:  if the supervisor imposed a 3-day suspension for a first offense, a second offensewould call for at least a 3-day suspension, even though the applicable items in the guide might show arange of reprimand to removal.  Similarly, if a supervisor imposed a 5-day suspension for a secondoffense, consideration of the penalty to be imposed for a third offense would begin with a 5-day sus-pension.34.3.  Supervisors impose a removal for misconduct or delinquency only after a progression of penal-ties unless discharge for a first or second offense is clearly warranted.34.4.  Supervisors need not include suspensions in a progression if the preceding reprimands clearlyshow that removal could result from repetitive improper behavior (see paragraph 12.1.4. and para-graph 12.1.5.).35.  Combination of Offenses. A particular situation may involve only one offense, may appear toinvolve more than one offense when there is actually only one, may involve more than one significantoffense, or may involve more than one offense only one of which is significant.  Avoid multiplying a sin-gle offense into several by including petty instances in your notice of proposed action when the significantoffense provides ample basis for taking necessary action.35.1.  When different, significant offenses occur in combination, supervisors may include eachoffense as a cause of action.  In this case, supervisors may impose a more severe penalty than wouldbe appropriate for a single offense; but the penalty normally will not exceed that typically imposed forthe most serious offense as determined by applying the appropriate offense column of the guide forthe number of offenses in combination, including any prior offenses.36.  Series of Offenses. A series of offenses occurs when more than one offense is committed by anemployee at different times and appropriate action could not be completed on each of these offenses indi-28AFI36-704   22 JULY 1994vidually before another was committed, even though management has proceeded at a reasonable pace.Supervisors may assess a more serious penalty for a series of offenses than would be appropriate for a sin-gle offense.  However, the penalty imposed normally will not exceed the most severe shown in the appro-priate offense column of the guide (considering the number of offenses in the series and any prioroffenses) for the most serious cause of action in the series.37.  Prior Offenses. See Attachment 1.  Supervisors may use an employee's prior offenses in determin-ing the severity of the penalty for a current offense even though the prior offenses may have involved dif-ferent infractions.  When used in this manner, supervisors show the prior offenses and the resultingpenalties imposed in the notice of proposed action (if any) and in the notice of final decision.37.1.  Supervisors may consider a suspension as a prior offense only if its effective date fell within the3 years preceding the date of the current notice of proposed action.37.2.  Supervisors may consider an oral admonishment or a reprimand as a prior offense only if itseffective date fell within the 2 years preceding the date of the current notice of proposed action.37.3.  Supervisors may not consider a breach of the employee-employer relationship for which an oraladmonishment was imposed as an "offense" for the purpose of applying Attachment 3.37.3.1.  Supervisors may use an oral admonishment to support their decision that a reprimandwould be an appropriate penalty.  Don't use an oral admonishment to support selection of anadverse action penalty.37.3.2.  Supervisors may use an oral admonishment in any disciplinary action to document that anemployee has been apprised of a rule, regulation, other directive, or of his or her past misconductor delinquency.BILLY J.

Cause of Action Column:A3.1.1.  IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO STATE A CAUSE OF ACTION EXACTLY AS SHOWNIN THIS COLUMN. What is important is to state exactly what the employee did wrong, preferablywithout using legal terms suggesting crime.  If such legal terms were used, it might be necessary toprove all the elements necessary to establish that the crime has been committed, including feloniousintent.A3.1.2.  Cause is best identified by a specific charge or label for the offense IF that charge or label isrelevant.  BE CAREFUL TO SELECT A LABEL WHICH FITS THE FACTS AND NOT TODISTORT THE FACTS TO FIT A SPECIFIED OFFENSE IN THE GUIDE.A3.2.  Typical Penalty Column. This column does not dictate the penalty to be imposed for a particular(or comparable) offense; rather, it establishes the range of penalties within which the penalty imposedusually falls.  Unless otherwise restricted, management may impose no penalty at all or has available achoice of severity of action ranging from oral admonishment to removal.NOTE: See paragraph 3.  of this instruction for information concerning employees in probationary ortrial period, or in first year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions.A3.2.1.  Oral Admonishment. An oral admonishment is a disciplinary action that is often adequateto effect the required correction or improvement, particularly when the employee has no previous his-tory of violations.  See paragraph 37.3. for the use of the oral admonishment in relation to this attach-ment.A3.2.2.  Reprimand. A reprimand is a severe disciplinary action that should be adequate for manydisciplinary situations which require an action more severe than an oral admonishment.  It may bemade more "severe" according to paragraph 12.1.4.A3.2.3.  Suspension. A suspension is a severe disciplinary action.  Ordinarily, it is the final step in thedisciplinary process before removal and is accompanied by a warning to the employee that a furtherviolation of rules COULD result in removal (see paragraph 13.1.1.)A3.2.3.1.  A suspension may NOT be imposed for indebtedness nor performance-related factorswhen the situation is nondisciplinary.A3.2.3.2.  Suspensions seldom should exceed 30 days unless an indefinite suspension is used.A3.2.4.  Removal. Removal is the most severe disciplinary action.  Before it is initiated, the facts andcircumstances in the case must be carefully reviewed to ensure they support the conclusion that theemployee has demonstrated unwillingness or refusal to conform to the rules of conduct or has sobreached the employee-employer relationship that other rehabilitation is not appropriate and removalis warranted for the offense.AFI36-704   22 JULY 199435Cause of Action (Offense)Typical Penaltya.

Failure to honor valid debts or legalobligationsNOTE: There is no offense unless (a) the validity of the debt is established; (b) there has been a failure toeither arrange for or comply with a repayment schedule; and (c) there is a current complaint from the creditor.  Suspension as a penalty is not authorized.  Maximum penalty for third offense is reprimand and for fourth offense, reprimand with the added warning that a "continuation of offenses could result in removal."2. Tardiness of less than one-half hour.NOTE: Counseling or an oral admonishment is normally used for a first occurrence of tardiness.  A fourth offense would typically result in a suspension of 5 days or less with the added warning that a "continuation of offenses could result in removal."3. Tardiness of one-half hour or more,leaving the job without permission, delayedreturn from lunch, unauthorized absence of8 hours or less.4. Unauthorized absence of more than 8hours.NOTE: A removal using adverse action procedures in this regulation, may be initiated for a first or later offense after passage of a reasonable time (a minimum of 10 calendar days) when the employee fails to report for duty and fails to notify management of his or her intentions concerning return to duty, and when management has been unable to ascertain the employee's intentions concerning return.
