General.  This  instruction  establishes  basic  configurations,  standard  equipment,  and equipment  location  aboard  the  C-5.  Included  are  weight  and  balance,  standard  weight  and moment  data  for  use  in  completing  DD  Form  365-4,  Weight  and  Balance  Clearance  Form  F-Transport/Tactical. 1.2.  Airplane  Coding.  This  instruction  provides  coverage  for  C-5A,  C-5B,  C-5M,  and  C-5A Space Canister Modified (SCM) airplanes. C-5A airplanes are designated by the letter {A} C-5B by  the  letter  {B},  C-5M  by  the  letter  {M},  and  C-5A  SCM  by  the  letter  {S}.  Portions  of  this instruction are designated by the use of these symbols to indicate applicability to C-5A, C-5B, C-5M, C-5A SCM, or C-5M SCM airplanes. Items not designated as applicable to either {A}, {B}, {M}, or {S} airplanes are applicable to all four series. 1.3.  Responsibility.  Air  Force  units  performing  services  on  the  C-5  airplane,  e.g.  terminal services,  support  equipment  branch,  and  Aircrew  Flight  Equipment  are  responsible  for configuring  the  aircraft  with  the  equipment  listed  in  this  instruction  or  as  outlined  in  mission directives. This includes stowage or installation of the equipment according to the configurations in this instruction and applicable installation directives (i.e. Technical Orders (T.O.) 1C-5A-2-2, 1C-5M-2-2, 1C-5A-21, 1C-5M-21, 1C-5A- 9 and 1C-5M-9). During preflight, aircrew personnel will ensure that required mission equipment has been provided and properly serviced, installed, or stowed. 1.4.  Standard  Configuration  Codes.  Use  the  letter  codes  in  Table  1.1  when  referring  to  C-5 configurations. The number that identifies the configuration capability will follow the letter code.  Each configuration code will be indicated in the mission directive. 1.5.  Deviations  and  Waivers.  Configurations  in  this  instruction  may  require  deviations  for specific  mission  requirements.  Each  mission  directive  will  identify  the  basic  configuration  and any  deviations.  For  example,  a  Phoenix  Banner  mission  carrying  presidential  helicopters  may require an additional winch. Deviations may require changes to weight and balance calculations. 1.6.  Weight  and  Balance.  To  standardize  equipment  quantities  and  locations,  items  shown  in Table 2.1. will be included in the basic weight of the aircraft and remain on the aircraft except for  maintenance  and  inspection.

Part number (P/N) 358-1506 series oxygen mask with goggles attached is the preferred smoke and fume protection for aircrew personnel. Firefighters smoke masks may be used until 358-series oxygen masks and goggles are available. 2. EPOS is the preferred system for passenger smoke and fume protection. As a minimum, each aircraft will have one EPOS per passenger. Preposition additional EPOS for increased scheduled PAX loads. 3. Add parachutes as required by other configuration publications. 4. The A/C is the preferred LPU for passengers. As a minimum, each aircraft will have one LPU for each passenger. 5. The LPU-10/P LPU is required to integrate with ALSE and is designed for use by aircrew personnel. A/C LPUs are not compatible for use with parachutes and survival vests and must not be used as a substitute for this LPU. 6. Survival Vests are required when parachutes are prepositioned aboard aircraft, or any time aircrew is flying a combat mission and they are required by theater SPINS.  Survival vests provide crewmembers the necessary survival items while waiting for rescue or return to duty. Quantities will match number of parachutes aboard aircraft. 7. Aircraft flying over water to Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM) will load one 25-person life raft and five LPU-10/Ps to support crewmembers as required. 8. For all aircraft transfers, position ALSE on each aircraft IAW permanent transfer configuration. Units gaining transferred aircraft, to include PDM aircraft, will contact the losing organization’s AFE section and initiate transfer of required aircraft-installed ALSE and inspection records. Gaining AFE organization will conduct an aircraft acceptance inspection and forward a copy of discrepancies, to include any equipment shortages, to their respective MAJCOM IAW T.O. 00-20-1. Do not transfer aircraft with less than the required equipment. The losing organization will make up any necessary shortages from on-hand assets to ensure transferring aircraft has required equipment installed. AFI11-2C-5V3_ADDENDA-A  1 NOVEMBER 2011   11  9.

Scope.  This chapter contains information to assist personnel in load planning. 4.2.  General.  Table  4.1  contains  standard  weight  information.  The  following  factors  must  be considered during load planning: 4.2.1.  The  cargo  load  must  be  planned  so  that  the  center  of  gravity  of  the  loaded  airplane shall be within specified forward and aft limits. Consideration must also be given to offload sequence, airplane limitations, and emergency jettisoning. For fuel efficiency, plan for a zero fuel center of gravity of approximately 38 percent of MAC. NOTE: Any possible addition of passengers and baggage must be accounted for during planning to prevent the possibility of exceeding aircraft limitations. For example, if a full load of passengers and baggage could be added, initially loadplanning for a zero  fuel  center of  gravity of 36 percent  of MAC  would prevent exceeding aircraft center of gravity limitations. 4.2.2.  Pallets loaded in pallet positions 1, 2, 35, and 36 (forward and aft ramps) shall have a 14-inch  access,  which  shall  extend  from  the  outboard  edge  of  the  pallet  to  the  vertical stacking line of the cargo (T.O. 1C-5A-9, and T.O. 1C-5M-9). 4.2.3.  No  lateral  overhang  permitted  for  pallets  loaded  into  the  aircraft  rail  system.  Ensure the maximum width of 104 inches of usable area of the pallet is not exceeded (T.O. 1C-5A-9 and T.O. 1C-5M-9). 4.2.4.  The  maximum  height  of  cargo  for  pallet  positions  35  and  36  (aft  ramp)  shall  not exceed 70 inches measured on the aft side of the pallet (T.O. 1C-5A-9, and T.O. 1C-5M-9) 4.2.5.  The weight limit on the forward or aft ramp is 7,500 pounds-per-pallet position (T.O. 1C-5A-9, and T.O. 1C-5M-9) 4.2.6.  {S}  AFT  cargo  door  configuration  prohibits  left  or  right  straight  in  loading  of palletized cargo into the logistics rail system (T.O. 1C-5A-9-1, and T.O. 1C-5M-9-1). 4.2.7.  When 20 or more passengers or troops are planned, a pallet position shall be left open to accommodate the palletized baggage. 4.2.8.  Do not  place cargo in  a position that shall restrict the  use of the flight  deck or troop compartment ladders. 4.3.  Planning for the Loading and Placement of Hazardous Cargo.  All classes of hazardous materials  listed  as  acceptable  for  air  transportation  may  be  transported  on  the  C-5  airplane.  Hazardous  cargo  that  is  considered  jettisonable  shall  not  be  positioned  forward  of  non-jettisonable cargo, i.e. vehicles, helicopters, pallet trains,  etc., except when weight  and location will  permit  jettisoning  by  hand.  Hazardous  jettisonable  cargo  must  be  readily  accessible  and positioned for emergency jettison. 4.4.  Miscellaneous Data. 4.5.  {A}{B} Personnel Limitation with One Lavatory Inoperative.  The Personnel Limitation Chart  (Figure  4.1.)  reflects  the  number  of  passengers  or  troops  that  one  troop  compartment   16  AFI11-2C-5V3_ADDENDA-A  1 NOVEMBER 2011 lavatory can  accommodate and must be considered when determining the number of personnel that can be airlifted with one inoperative lavatory.
