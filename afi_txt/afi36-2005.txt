SUMMARY OF CHANGES This  document  has  been  substantially  revised  and  should  be  completely  reviewed.    Wing  level requirements  have  been  tiered  and  assigned  an  appropriate  tier  waiver  level.    Major  changes include consolidation  of  all officer accession policies into one AFI, integration of Air National Guard  accession  policy,  and  alignment  of  accession  policies  across  the  Total  Force  where possible.  Eligibility standards and waiver authorities are provided in greater detail utilizing the recruiter  tool  of  “CCMAPPEDDS”  (Conscientious  Objector,  Citizenship, Moral  Conduct,  Age, Prior  Service,  Physical  Condition,  Education,  Dependent  Status,  Drugs,  Social  Security Number).    Provisions  were  added  to  allow  the  use  of  adjusted  age  for  prior  service  applicants.  Maximum  age  for  lieutenants  was  increased  from  35  years  to  prior  to  the  applicant’s  40th birthday  for  all  air  components  to  allow  greater  flexibility  in  accessing  the  most  qualified applicants.    Security  investigation  requirements  were  updated  to  reflect  changes  in  the Department  of  Defense  (DoD)  policy.    Reference  to  the  Military  Selective  Service  Act  was AFI36-2005  2 AUGUST 2017 3 updated to reflect reclassification as Title 50, Chapter 49.  Education qualifications for specific professional  categories  were  removed,  as  they  are  contained  in  the  Air  Force  Officer Classification Directory (AFOCD).

Appointment is not assured merely by  meeting  the  established  minimum  requirements.    Forward  waiver  requests  through appropriate command channels only if recommending approval.  The overriding consideration is the  best  interest  of  the  Air  Force.    Waiver  authority  may  not  be  further  delegated  unless specifically stated. 2.1.1.  It  is  the  applicant's  responsibility  to  furnish  documents  (original  or  a  copy  certified true by the issuing agency), which prove he/she meets all eligibility requirements. 2.1.2.  If  an  applicant  previously  applied  for  appointment  but  was  not  selected,  or  was selected  for  appointment  but  declined,  the  individual  is  ineligible  to  reapply  with  the  same component for 12 months from  the date notified  of non-selection or the date the individual declined  the  appointment.  (T-3)  Send  requests  to  waive  this  restriction  through  command channels  to  the  nomination  authority.    Note:    This  restriction  does  not  apply  to  individuals applying for appointment  or reappointment for judge  advocate or health professional  duties or designation as a judge advocate or health professional. 2.1.3.  When the appointment depends on immediate entry on active duty, the applicant must be available for active duty 30 calendar days from the date of acceptance of appointment. (T-2)   Note:  Commissioning sources may waive this requirement, not to exceed 60 days from the date of acceptance of appointment. 2.1.4.

(T-1) 2.1.5.  Military  Service  Obligation  (MSO).    Prior  to  appointment,  applicants  are  advised  of the  MSO  which  they  will  incur  under  DoDI  1304.25,  Fulfilling  the  Military  Service Obligation. 2.1.5.1.

As such, a religious accommodation may be granted at  one  assignment  but  denied  at  another  assignment.    Every  request  is  fully  considered  by  the appropriate  authority;  however,  if  the  request  is  denied  the  Airman  is  required  to  comply  with Air  Force  standards.    Following  the  briefing,  the  applicant's  acknowledgment  of  the  Air  Force policy  regarding  religious  accommodation  requests  is  recorded  and  maintained  as  part  of  the accession application. 2.4.1.  Immediate  commanders  may  approve  or  disapprove  requests  for  accommodation  of religious  practices  that  do  not  require  a  waiver  of  Air  Force  policies  regarding  the  wear  of military uniforms or religious apparel, or grooming, appearance, or body art standards. 2.4.2.  Waiver  authority  for  requests  for  accommodation  of  religious  practice  regarding  the wear  of  military  uniforms  or  religious  apparel,  or  grooming,  appearance,  or  body  art standards is AF/A1. 2.5.

AFPC Military Retirement and  Separation Section (AFPC/DP2STM)  projects  an  officer  with  a  remaining  MSO  for  transfer  to  the  Individual Ready  Reserve  (IRR)  with  assignment  to  the  Obligated  Reserve  Section  (ORS),  unless  the officer applied for a SelRes or PIRR assignment. 6.1.1.1.  Separation  from  the  RegAF  and  acceptance  of  the  Reserve  commission  takes place on sequential dates.  The separation from RegAF occurs at 2400 hours on the date specified  in  the  separation  orders,  the  individual  becomes  a  AFR  officer  immediately following.  The special order (AF Form 100, Request and Authorization for Separation) announces the separation from RegAF, while the AFR appointment order documents the accession into the AFR. 6.1.2.  A RegAF officer, who does not have a MSO or unfulfilled contractual agreement (i.e. ADSC,  etc)  and  who  is  honorably  discharged  by  reason  of  unqualified  resignation,  may request appointment as an AFR officer at the time of resignation. 6.1.2.1.  Since  accepting  a  Reserve  commission  constitutes  voluntary  assignment  to  the Ready  Reserve  (i.e.  IRR  or  SelRes),  AFPC/DP2STM  projects  an  officer  requesting appointment under paragraph 6.1.2. for transfer to the Ready Reserve and assignment to the  Nonobligated  Nonparticipating  Ready  Personnel  Section  (NNRPS),  unless  they applied for a Ready Reserve participating assignment. 6.1.2.2.

CSC  is  to  provide  grade  and  DOR  comparability  for  an individual who begins commissioned service after obtaining the additional education, training, or experience required for appointment, designation, or assignment as a commissioned officer in a professional field relative to a contemporary who began commissioned service immediately after obtaining  a  baccalaureate  degree.    CSC  is  determined  in  accordance  with  the  following guidelines. 10.3.1.  A period of time, or qualification, is counted only once when computing CSC. 10.3.2.  Periods of time spent in an active status as a commissioned officer or on active duty may  not  be  counted  when  CSC  credit,  except  as  noted  in  Table  10.4.,  Table  10.5.,  and Table 10.6. 10.3.2.1.  An  officer  who  completes  an  advanced  education  or  receives  an  advanced degree that qualifies for CSC while in an active status may be credited with CSC if the officer  completes  the  advanced  education  or  receives  the  advanced  degree  in  less  time than normally required to do so. 10.3.2.2.  The  amount  of  CSC  awarded  is  the  difference  between  the  number  of  years normally required to complete the education program and the number of years in which the program is completed by the officer. 10.3.2.3.  The  time  normally  required  to  complete  an  advanced  education  or  receive  an advanced  degree  is  the  number  of  years  (to  the  nearest  year)  normally  required  by  the majority  of  institutions  that  award  degrees  in  that  professional  field  to  complete  the advanced education or receive the advanced degree. 10.3.3.  Proportionately award credit to the nearest day qualifying periods of less than 1 year except where otherwise noted in Table 10.4., Table 10.5., and Table 10.6. 10.3.4.  Count  CSC  listed  in  Table  10.4.,  Table  10.5.,  and  Table  10.6.  for  education  or professional training.  When education or training overlaps other creditable service, count the CSC  first,  then  reduce  the  other  creditable  service  for  any  overlapping  period.    Award  full CSC through the date the officer completed professional requirements. 10.3.5.  CSC  credited  an  officer  under  paragraph  10.4  through    10.8.  is  used  only  for determining the officer’s: 10.3.5.1.  Initial grade as an officer; 52 AFI36-2005  2 AUGUST 2017 10.3.5.2.

Use Table 11.1. to determine entry grade. 11.1.1.  An individual granted service credit under this instruction and placed on the ADL or RASL  may  have  an  entry  grade  determined  by  comparing  entry  grade  credit  with  the appropriate  promotion  phase  points  of  the  AF  as  defined  by  AFI  36-2501,  Officer Promotions and Selective Continuation, AFI 36-2504, Officer Promotion, Continuation and Selective  Early  Removal  in  the  Reserve  of  the  Air  Force,  and  ANGI  36-2505,  Federal Recognition  Examining  Boards  for  Appointment  or  Promotion  in  the  Air  National  Guard Below General Officer.  Except as limited by paragraph 7.5., credit granted that exceeds the amount used to establish the entry grade is used to adjust the DOR.  ARC officers are ordered to Extended Active Duty (EAD) in their Reserve grades. 11.1.2.  An individual who is a former commissioned officer may, if otherwise qualified, be appointed as a Reserve officer.  The member: 11.1.2.1.  Is placed on the RASL in the grade equivalent to the permanent grade, and in the same competitive category, in which the person previously served satisfactorily, and 11.1.2.2.  May  be  credited  for  determining  DOR  with  service  in  grade  equal  to  that  the member held when discharged or separated. 11.1.3.  When  an  ARC  commissioned  officer  is  transferred  from  an  inactive  status  to  an active status and placed on the ADL or the RASL, the SecAF may, effective on the date the officer  is  placed  on  either  list,  change  the  officer’s  DOR  to  a  later  date  to  reflect  such officer’s qualifications and experience.  Note:  This authority does not apply in the case of an officer  who has served  continuously in  the SelRes of the Ready Reserve  since the officer’s last promotion or is placed on the ADL while on a promotion list.

For appointment in this grade, see paragraph 11.2. 11.2.  Maximum Entry Grade Credit.  The total entry grade credit granted may not exceed that required for the person to receive an entry grade of major. 11.2.1.  The  SAF  may  waive  the  entry  grade  limit  of  major  to  permit  appointment  in  the grades of lieutenant colonel or colonel to relieve manning shortfalls in a specialty, or prevent a serious inequity in the appointment action.  In these cases, credit is limited to the minimum amount required for appointment in these grades. 11.2.1.1.  AFPC/DP2N,  NGB/A1PO,  or  AF/RE-D  may  waive  the  limit  for  appointment of  medical  and  dental  officers  in  the  grade  of  lieutenant  colonel  in  shortage  specialties designated  by  AF/SG  in  coordination  with  NGB/SG  and  AFRC/SG.

Compute the TYSD by back dating the date of appointment by the total amount of service credit awarded according to AFI 36-2604 and this instruction.  The DOR is the same as the officer's RegAF DOR (see note 3).  The TFCSD is the same as that held on the date of discharge. determine the grade, TYSD, and DOR based on service credit provisions in effect for the Air Force at the time of appointment.  When the determination results in a grade higher than the previously held grade, appoint in the grade determined based on service credit.  When the grade determination results in a grade equal to or lower than the previously held grade, appoint the officer in the previously held grade.  Compute the TYSD by backdating the date of the latest appointment by the total amount of service credit awarded according to AFI 36-2604 and this instruction.  Add the break in service to the previously held TFCSD and DOR.  Add periods of inactive status in the previously held grade to the previously held DOR. 5 is a former officer of another uniformed service who, after discharge, accepts appointment in the ARC after a break in service (when appointing as an MC officer, see note 4) determine the grade according to Table 11.1 (see note 1).

Compute the TYSD by backdating the date of appointment by the total amount of service credit awarded according to AFI 36-2604 and this instruction.  The DOR is the DOR held in the parent service adjusted for any periods of inactive status.  The TFCSD is the same as that held in the parent service.  The TYSD and DOR cannot place the officer beyond mandatory phase points for promotion to the next higher Reserve grade. 66 R U L E 6 7 8  Note: 1.  Limit total service credit awarded to that required for the person to receive an entry grade of major unless granted a waiver according to paragraph 11.2.  Also, the awarded DOR may not result in the officer being eligible for promotion consideration within the next 12 months.  Example:  For officers appointed as first lieutenant, the maximum DOR credit is 3 years; as captain, 6 years; as major, 6 years. 2.  On reappointment an officer may qualify for the same grade, a higher grade, or a lower grade.  Compute the TYSD and DOR in these cases based on service credit provisions in effect at the time of reappointment.  Refer to paragraph 11.2. of this instruction for further guidance. 3.  If the officer had prior Reserve commissioned service in the same grade not reflected in the DOR, the DOR is adjusted to include prior promotion service in the same grade, excluding inactive service. 4.  If the former officer was a physician in another uniformed service, SAF/MR may approve a request for appointing the officer under rule 4 versus rule 5 as an ETP, if justified.  Forward fully justified requests for ETP to AFPC/DP2N (for RegAF appointments), NGB/A1PO (for ANG appointments), or AF/REP (for AFR appointments), for disapproval or recommended approval.  If AFPC/DP2N, NGB/A1PO, or AF/REP recommends approval, they forward the request to AF/A1PT for processing to SAF/MR for a final decision. 5.  This rule applies whether or not there is a break in service. AFI36-2005  2 AUGUST 2017 67 Chapter 12 APPOINTMENT NOMINATION AND SCROLLING 12.1.  Appointment  as  Regular  Officer.

Brief applicants, prior to the commissioning oath, as follows: A8.1.1.  As  military  members,  you  occupy  a  unique  position  in  society.    You  represent  the military  establishment.    This  special  status  brings  with  it  the  responsibility  to  uphold  and maintain the dignity and high standards of the US Armed Forces at all times and in all places.  The  Armed  Forces  must  also  be  ready  at  all  times  for  worldwide  deployment.    This  fact carries with it the requirement for military units and their members to possess high standards of morale, good order and discipline, and cohesion.  As a result, military laws, rules, customs and  traditions  include  restrictions  on  your  personal  behavior  that  may  be  different  from civilian life.  Members of the Armed Forces may be involuntarily separated before their term of  service  ends  for  various  reasons  established  by  law  and  military  regulations.    Some unacceptable conduct may be grounds for involuntary separation, such as: A8.1.1.1.  You  establish  a  pattern  of  disciplinary  infractions,  discreditable  involvement with civil or military authorities or you cause dissent, or disrupt or degrade the mission of your unit.  This may also include conduct of any nature that would bring discredit on the Armed Forces in the view of the civilian community. A8.1.1.2.  Because  of  parental  responsibilities,  you  are  unable  to  perform  your  duties satisfactorily or you are unavailable for worldwide assignment or deployment. A8.1.1.3.  You fail to meet the fitness standards. A8.1.2.  Provide a typed copy of the following to each applicant prior to the commissioning oath: *RESTRICTIONS ON PERSONAL CONDUCT IN THE ARMED FORCES Military life is fundamentally different from civilian life.  The military has its own laws, rules, customs, and traditions, including numerous restrictions on personal behavior that may be acceptable in civilian society.  These are necessary because military units and personnel maintain the high standards of morale, good order and discipline, and unit cohesion essential for combat effectiveness. The Armed Forces must be ready at all times for worldwide deployment.  Military laws and regulations, including the Uniform Code of Military Justice, apply to service members at all times, both on base and off base, from the time the member enters the service until the member is discharged or otherwise separated from the Armed Forces. *Members of the Armed Forces may be involuntarily separated before their term of service ends for various reasons established by law and military regulations, such as: (a) member may be separated for a pattern of disciplinary infractions, a pattern of misconduct, commission of a serious offense, or civilian conviction, (b) a member who has been referred to a rehabilitation program for personal drug and alcohol abuse may be separated for failure through inability or refusal to participate in, cooperate in, or successfully complete such a program, (c) a member may be discharged by reason of parenthood, if it is determined the member because of parental responsibilities, is unable to perform his or her duties satisfactorily or is unavailable for worldwide assignment or deployment, or (d) a member may be separated for failure to meet service fitness standards.
