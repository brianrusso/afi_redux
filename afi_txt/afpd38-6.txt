SUMMARY OF CHANGES The  Directorate  of  Manpower,  Organization  and  Resources  (AF/A1M)  is  now  responsible  for this publication.  The guidance on a MAJCOM’s ability to delegate the authority to issue mission   2  AFPD38-6  23 DECEMBER 2014 directives  was  clarified.    Clarification  was  provided  on  which  units  require  mission  directives and the ability to issue one mission directive for several units with like missions. 1.  Overview. 1.1.  This  AFPD  establishes  policies comprehensive, and current mission directives. to  ensure  organizations issue  clear, timely, 1.2.  It is essential to clearly communicate a unit's mission to its commander and people. 1.3.  HAF, MAJCOMs, DRUs and FOAs issue mission directives for their subordinate units. 2.  Policy. 2.1.  MAJCOMs, DRUs, and FOAs issue mission directives for each directly assigned unit.  MAJCOMs may delegate the authority to issue mission directives. 2.2.  The  OPR,  certifying  authority,  and  approving  authority  for  an  organization’s  mission directive must be in a higher level organization within its chain of command. 2.3.  Every  unit  in  the  Air  Force  will  have  a  mission  directive;  (reference  AFI  38-101,  Air Force Organization, for the definition of a unit.) 2.4.  Detachments  and  other  activities  below  squadron  level  do  not  require  a  mission directive unless directed by the MAJCOM, DRU or FOA commander. 2.5.  When  two  or  more  subordinate  units  have  the  same  mission,  the  MAJCOM,  DRU,  or FOA may issue a single mission directive.  For example, when several wings have the same mission, only one mission directive is necessary for those wings.  Similarly, for example, a wing  with  three  flying  squadrons  with  the  same  mission  need  issue  only  one  mission directive for all three squadrons. 2.6.  At  their  discretion,  MAJCOMs  may  waive  the  requirement  for  a  mission  directive  for units  below  the  Numbered  Air  Force  level  which  have  a  current  designed  operational capability  statement  in  accordance  with  AFI  10-201,  Status  of  Resources  and  Training System. 3.
