AF Form 847 is prescribed in AFI 11-215, USAF Flight Manuals Program [FMP].  Refer to that publication for guidance on filling out the form.) 1.2.2.  AF/A3 is approval authority for changes or revisions to this instruction.  (T-1). 1.2.3.  Except as specified elsewhere in this instruction, MAJCOM/A3 is the waiver authority for this instruction.  (T-2).  Waiver  requests will be submitted on AF  Form 697,  Air Force Publication  Compliance  Item  Waiver  Request/Approval,  and  will  be  sent  through  the stan/eval chain of command.  (T-2). 1.3.  Procedures: 1.3.1.  Flight examiners (FE) will use the evaluation criteria contained in this instruction for conducting  flight  and  emergency  procedure  evaluations  (EPE).    (T-2).    To  ensure  standard and  objective  evaluations,  FEs  must  become  thoroughly  familiar  with  the  prescribed evaluation criteria. 1.3.2.  The  examinee  will  fly  in  the  seat  that  best  enables  the  FE  to  conduct  a  thorough evaluation. 1.3.3.  Prior to the flight, the FE will brief the examinee on the purpose of the evaluation and how  it  should  be  conducted.    (T-2).    The  examinee  accomplishes  required  flight  planning during  the  evaluation  and  furnishes  the  FE  a  copy  of  necessary  mission  data,  mission materials, and charts (as required). 1.3.4.  The FE will thoroughly debrief all aspects of the  flight.  (T-2).  Debriefs include the examinee’s overall rating, specific deviations, area grades assigned (if other than qualified), and  any  required  additional  training.    A  squadron  supervisor  must  be  debriefed  on  all evaluations.  (T-2).  Additionally, a squadron supervisor must attend the debrief if the overall grade is Qualification Level 3 (Q-3).  (T-2). 1.3.5.  To  initially  qualify  as  an  instructor,  a  pilot  must  successfully  complete  a  dedicated initial  instructor  evaluation.    (T-2).    Subsequently,  crewmembers  designated  as  instructors will be evaluated on their ability to instruct during all periodic evaluations.  (T-2).  FEs will act as a student for the purpose of evaluating the examinee’s instructional ability.  (T-2). 1.4.  Grading Instructions: 1.4.1.  Tolerances  in  performance  parameters  are  based  on  conditions  of  smooth  air  and  a stable  aircraft.    FEs  will  not  consider  momentary  deviations  from  tolerances  in  grading, provided  the  examinee  applies  prompt  corrective  action  and  such  deviations  do  not AFI11-2T-41-51-53V2  9 JUNE 2017 5 jeopardize  flying  safety.    (T-2).    Consider  cumulative  deviations  when  determining  the overall grade. 1.4.2.  FEs  will  use  the  grading  criteria  in  Table  1.1  and  Table  3.1  to  determine  individual area  grades.    (T-2).    When  individual  areas  are  performed  well  above  the  grading  criteria standards,  then  make  an  appropriate  comment  stating  performance  and/or  instruction  was commendable  in  the  Examiner’s  Remarks  in  the  Comments  block  of  the  AF  Form  8, Certificate  of  Aircrew  Qualification,  or  AF  Form  8a,  Certificate  of  Aircrew  Qualification (Multiple    Aircraft).    FE  judgment  should  be  exercised  when  the  evaluation  criterion  is subjective or the specific situation is not covered. 1.4.3.  Derive  the  overall  flight  evaluation  grade  (Q-1,  Q-2,  or  Q-3)  from  the  area  grades, based on a composite for the observed events and tasks, according to AFI 11-202, Volume 2, Aircrew Standardization and Evaluation Program, this instruction and FE judgment. 1.4.4.  If  the  examinee  receives  an  unqualified  grade  (U)  in  any  critical  area,  the  FE  will mark  the  overall  grade  for  the  evaluation  as  unqualified  (Q-3).    (T-2).    Critical  areas  are identified by "Critical" in the area title in Chapter 3.  FEs will grade critical areas as "Q" or "U." 1.4.5.  The general evaluation criteria in  Table 1.1 apply during all phases of flight (except for specific events noted in Table 3.1). Table 1.1.  General Evaluation Criteria. General I T E Area M 1  Altitude 2  Airspeed 3 A Heading B Q C Q- D U ±100 feet ±5 knots Maintains/rolls out ±5 ° of desired heading ±200 feet ±10 knots Maintains/rolls out ±10 ° of desired heading Exceeds Q- limits 1.5.  Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE).  FEs will administer oral EPEs on the ground.  (T-2). 1.5.1.  The FE will include an evaluation of the following items on the EPE: 1.5.1.1.

Units will not permit examinees receiving an overall unqualified grade (Q-3) because of  an  unsatisfactory  EPE  to  fly  in  any  aircrew  position  until  the  examinee  completes  a successful reevaluation.  (T-2). 1.5.3.  For each EPE graded “qualified” with additional training required, the FE will indicate whether the additional training should be accomplished before the next flight.  (T-2). 6 AFI11-2T-41-51-53V2  9 JUNE 2017 1.6.  Completion of AF Form 8 or AF Form 8A.  Record aircrew member qualifications on the AF Form 8 or AF Form 8A, in accordance with AFI 11-202, Volume 2.  (Exception: Units will record  nonrated  pilot  qualifications  on  a  temporary  certificate  of  evaluation  kept  in  the  pilot’s training folder.)  (T-2). 1.6.1.  When  an  evaluation  in  one  aircraft  satisfies  the  evaluations  requirements  in  another aircraft,  include  a  comment  stating  so  in  the  examiner’s  remarks  on  an  AF  Form  8  or  AF Form 8A. 1.6.2.  With  the  exception  of  restrictions  and  exceptionally  qualified  designation  (if  used), place all comments on the reverse side of the AF Form 8 or AF Form 8A. AFI11-2T-41-51-53V2  9 JUNE 2017 7 Chapter 2 EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS 2.1.  General.  There  are  four  types  of  evaluations:  qualification  (QUAL),  mission  (MSN), instructor  (INSTR),  and  SPOT.    Evaluations  include  requisites  and  required  areas.    Table  2.1 indicates when a requisite is required for an evaluation.  Table 2.2 prescribes required areas that are  included  in  the  flight  evaluation  profile.    Evaluation  areas  are  aligned  under  the  type  of evaluation. 2.1.1.  Alternative  Evaluation  Methods.  Alternate  evaluation  methods  are  not  authorized.  If the FE determines one or more of the required items cannot be adequately evaluated, the examinee must complete an additional flight to complete the evaluation.  (T-2). 2.1.2.  Publications Check.  The FE will check these publications during the evaluation:   Technical  Order  (TO)  1T-41D-1CL-1,  Pilot’s 2.1.2.1.  For  T-41  evaluations: Abbreviated Flight Crew Checklist,  USAF Series T-41D Aircraft;  and the local  in-flight guide (IFG).  (T-2). 2.1.2.2.  For  T-51  evaluations:  TO  1T-51A-1CL-1,  Pilots’  Abbreviated  Flight  Manual Checklist, USAF, T-51A Series Aircraft, and the local IFG.  (T-2). 2.1.2.3.  For    T-53    evaluations:    TO    1T-53A-1CL-1,  Pilot’s  Abbreviated  Flight  Crew Checklist, USAF Series T-53 Aircraft, and the local IFG.  (T-2). 2.1.2.4.  For pilots qualified in multiple aircraft, check each set of publications.  (T-2). 2.2.  Requisites.  Table 2.1  indicates the minimum requisites for each type of evaluation.  When periodic evaluations are combined, the FE will accomplish all requisites for each evaluation and document in the ground phase section of AF Form 8 or AF Form 8A.  (T-2).  For each required exam, units may combine questions covering multiple aircraft into a single test. Table 2.1.  Evaluation Requisites (R = Required). A I T E M Requisite 1  Open book exam 2  Closed book 3  Boldface exam 4  EPE B C E QUAL MSN/INSTR SPOT R R R R   R R      2.3.  Pilot Evaluations.  The FE will include all required (R) areas from Table 2.2 in the flight evaluation profile.  (T-2).  A QUAL evaluation in the T-41, T-51, or T-53 satisfies the periodic QUAL evaluation requirements for the other aircraft so that only one periodic QUAL evaluation is required. 2.4.  Instructor  Pilot Evaluations.  Normally, following the initial MSN/INSTR evaluation, all periodic  IP  evaluations  are  combined  QUAL/MSN/INSTR  evaluations  to  evaluate  both proficiency  and instructor ability. The FE will include all required  areas  from  Table  2.2 in  the 8 AFI11-2T-41-51-53V2  9 JUNE 2017 flight evaluation profile.  (T-2).  The examiner will attempt at least two area maneuvers and one landing for the examinee to instruct and evaluate.  (T-2).  A MSN/INSTR evaluation in the T-41, T-51, or T-53 satisfies the periodic MSN/INSTR evaluation requirements for the other aircraft so that only one periodic MSN/INSTR evaluation is required.
