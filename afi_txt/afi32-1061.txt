(T-3) AFI32-1061  27 JANUARY 2016   15  Chapter 2 PURCHASING UTILITIES 2.1.  Utility  Acquisition  Authority.  The  Federal  Property  and  Administrative  Services  Act (FPASA)  [40  USC  501(a)]  authorizes  the  General  Services  Administration  (GSA)  to  manage, procure, and supply public utility services to the Government.  The FPASA also authorizes DoD to procure utility service, accomplished IAW a DoD-GSA agreement. 2.2.  Utility Service Requirements.  Refer to AFPAM 32-10144 to determine Air Force utility service requirements. 2.3.  Utility  Bills  and  Payment.  The  Financial  Management  section  of  the  Installations Management  Flight  shall  coordinate  to  ensure  utility  bills  are  validated  and  processed  for payment to avoid late fees.  (T-2)  For details on the utility bill payment process, see AFPAM 32-10144. 2.3.1.  The Funds Manager, or RA, in the Financial Management section validates utility bills for payment if the Energy Manager or representative confirms the bill is correct.  An e-mail from the Energy Manager or his representative is adequate for this confirmation.  Validate utility bills with the statement, “The services covered by this invoice have been received and the amount of $<insert amount> is proper for payment.  Errors in the invoice have/have not been identified and the utility company has been notified of these errors.” 2.3.2.  Do not delay a utility payment due to billing errors.  Ensure billing elements and rates comply with the most current contract rate.  If any elements of the bill are incorrect, pay the amount that would be owed if the elements were correct.  Notify the utility company of the discrepancy immediately and follow up with the utility company until the issues are resolved. 2.3.3.  Ensure the invoice contains applicable discounts. 2.3.4.  Ensure  demand  charges  for  periods  immediately  following  power  failures  do  not unfairly penalize the Air Force. 2.3.5.  Query  the  Commander’s  Resource  Integration  System  periodically  for  unpaid invoices. 2.3.6.  Where  appropriate,  follow  up  with  Air  Force  and  Defense  Finance  and  Accounting Service (DFAS) personnel prior to bill due dates to help eliminate late fees. 2.3.7.  There are several methods of metering and billing from a utility provider.  The most advantageous to the Air Force is one master meter and one monthly bill per utility provider.  This  is  not  always  possible  when  Air  Force  facilities  are  geographically  separated.    The preferred order of metering and billing for any utility services is as follows: 2.3.7.1.  One master meter and one monthly bill. 2.3.7.2.  Multiple meters with conjunctive (combined) billing. 2.3.7.3.  Multiple meters with separate billing for each meter. 2.4.  Utility  Purchase  Contract  Reviews.  Perform utility purchase contract reviews annually, or whenever a contract is to be modified, to ensure the Air Force is acquiring utilities at the most favorable  rate  available  and  costs  are  minimized.    Document  these  reviews  (consistent  with   16  AFI32-1061  27 JANUARY 2016 utility type) using AF Form 3550, Annual Utility Contract Review for Electric Service; AF Form 3551,  Annual  Utility  Contract  Review  for  Gas  Service;  and  AF  Form  3552,  Annual  Utility Contract Review for Water and Sewage Service.  For details, see AFPAM 32-10144. 2.5.  Utility  Service  Folders.  Installations shall  keep a utility service  folder for each supplier providing utilities to the installation.  (T-3)  The folder is a tool for managing purchased utilities.  For a list of folder contents, see AFPAM 32-10144.  This folder is not required at installations where another agency purchases the utilities for the Air Force. AFI32-1061  27 JANUARY 2016   17  Chapter 3 PRODUCING AND MANAGING UTILITIES 3.1.  Ownership  of  On-Base  Utility  Systems.  On-base  utility  distribution  and  production systems are owned, operated, and maintained either by the Government, a local municipality, a public or private utility provider, a SO, or a HP Project Owner (PO). 3.2.  Government Owned.  Government owned utility systems normally indicate the Air Force is responsible for construction, operations, maintenance, and repair for the utility (commodity) production and distribution system from the base fence or real estate boundary to the point of utility delivery to the customer.  If the Government does not produce the utility (commodity), the Government purchases the utility from an off-base provider.  Costs to provide utilities to the end user include the purchased utility and the operations, maintenance, repair, and construction of the distribution system. 3.2.1.  Limit  the  off-base  utility  supplier’s  ownership  to  that  part  of  the  system  needed  to connect the utility supplier's service delivery to the base.  This delivery point is normally at or near the base real estate boundary. 3.2.2.  ANG  and  AFRC  will  follow  the  policy  on  ownership  and  operation  of  ANG  and AFRC on-base utility distribution systems as set forth in Assistant Secretary of the Air Force and Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force memoranda. 3.3.  Public or Private Utility Provider-Owned.  These utility systems are wholly owned and operated by the provider that also supplies the utility (commodity) in the local area.  The point of utility  delivery  is  directly  to  the  facility  consuming  the  utility.    The  Government  is  not responsible for the maintenance or operations of any part of the distribution system including metering the consumption. 3.4.  Utility System is Owned by the SO.  If the on-base utility system has been privatized, it is wholly owned, operated, and maintained by  a SO.  The privatized utility  system may include production, distribution, collection, generation and treatment facilities.  The SO may be a private company or a local public utility company.  UP contracts are utility service contracts (FAR Part 41) with a maximum term of 50 years (10 USC §2688, Utility Systems, Conveyance Authority). 3.4.1.  If  the  SO  is  not  the  local  or  current  utility  provider,  the  SO  charges  are  a  separate charge in addition to the commodity or utility company billing. 3.4.2.  If the SO is also the local utility provider, then the UP costs may be included in the utility bill, depending on the structure of the utility contract. 3.5.  HP Owned.  If HP results in the utility system associated with the housing area transferred to the PO and Air Force facilities are located within the housing area, utility service for these facilities are acquired according to the following options: 3.5.1.  HP Distribution System Owned by Local Utility.  If the local utility company becomes the provider of utility service to the privatized housing area, then the installation procures utility service from the local utility company for the Air Force facilities within the HP owned area IAW this instruction or the USA, as applicable.   18  AFI32-1061  27 JANUARY 2016 3.5.2.  HP  Distribution  System  Owned  by  PO.    If  the  PO  owns  and  operates  the  utility distribution system in the privatized housing area, the Government (installation) may provide utility service on a reimbursable basis to the PO.  The Government (installation) provides the commodity  to  the  PO;  the  PO  provides  wheeling  service  without  charge  to  any  Air  Force facilities receiving service from the housing area utility distribution system.  The government installs  meters  to  measure  the  quantity  delivered  exclusively  to  the  Air  Force  facilities.  These  meters  are  read  monthly,  and  this  usage  deducted  from  the  metered  quantities delivered  by  the  Government  (installation)  to  the  PO.    These  instructions  prevail  unless otherwise stated in the applicable USA. 3.6.  Operations, Maintenance, and Repair Costs for Utility Systems.  The operation, repair, and  maintenance  costs  associated  with  commodity  production  and  utility  distribution  systems comes  from  work  orders,  maintenance  service  contracts  and  projects.    Coordinate  with  the Operations Flight for work order and maintenance service contract data and Engineering Flight for  project  data.    For  details  on  Government-Owned  Utility  Systems  and  Privatized  Utility Systems, see AFPAM 32-10144. 3.7.  Project  and  Capital  Investment  Costs.  Major  repair,  large  maintenance  work,  minor construction  and  new  construction  costs  associated  with  Government  owned  production  and distribution  utility  systems  normally  comes  from  projects.    Coordinate  with  the  Engineering Flight for project data. AFI32-1061  27 JANUARY 2016   19  Chapter 4 PROVIDING UTILITY COMMODITIES 4.1.  Utility Service Agreements.  10 USC §2686 authorizes the Secretary of the Air Force or his or her designee to sell utilities and related services to purchasers within or in the immediate vicinity of an Air Force installation. 10 USC §2872a authorizes the Secretary of the Air Force to furnish  certain  utilities  and  services  on  a  reimbursable  basis  in  connection  with  a  HP  project located on a military installation.  Proceeds collected for utility service sales are credited to the appropriated account used for the utility or related service. Ensure all USAs are in writing and signed  by  the  purchaser,  the  BCE  (or  MAJCOM  Civil  Engineer  as  listed  below),  and  the installation  commander  (or  his  or  her  designee)  and  attached  to  a  valid  support  agreement  or lease (see Table 4.1, Reimbursable Customer Service Agreement Form Matrix, for appropriate forms  and  corresponding  customer  classifications).    Keep  the  original  agreements  and  send copies  to  the  purchaser,  base  accounting  and  finance  office,  and  the  BCE  RA.    To  determine reimbursable  status  for  HP,  apply  the  Sole  Benefit  Test  IAW  applicable  AF  housing  policy, including AFI 32-6007 and AFPAM 32-10144. Table 4.1.  Reimbursable Customer Service Agreement Form Matrix.

Use AF Form 3553, Utility Sales Agreement for Non-Federal Organizations, for non-federal organizations.  In addition to the BCE approval, the MAJCOM Civil Engineer must also approve the AF Form 3553 for any sales occurring off the installation property. 4.1.2.  Use AF Form 3554, Utility Sales Agreement for DoD Agencies and Non-DoD Federal Agencies,  for  DoD  and  non-DoD  Federal  agencies.    A  purchaser  with  activities  in several facilities, such as MWR has only one AF Form 3554.  When additional space is needed, add in paragraph 5 of the form, “See attached memorandum which list each activity, facility, and address to be served.” 4.1.3.  Use  AF  Form  3555,  Utility  Sales  Rates Exhibit,  attached  as  Exhibit  A  in  AF  Form 3554 service agreements and Exhibit B in AF Form 3553 sales agreements for documenting resale or reimbursable utility rates.  This form may be updated as often as necessary to reflect rate changes.  This form is signed and approved by the BCE.  The purchaser does not sign   20  AFI32-1061  27 JANUARY 2016 this  form.    Annual  updates  of  AF  Form  3555  are  mandatory  and  include  the  previous  12 months of actual costs to compute sales rates.  Annual updates are effective 1 January of each year.    Use  AF  Form  3556,  Utility  Sales  Rates  Computation  Worksheet,  to  compute  utility rates.    Until  this  form  is  updated  on  the  Air  Force  e-Publishing  website,  contact  AFCEC directly  for  the  current  version.    For  more  information  on  how  to  calculate  utility reimbursement rates, see AFPAM 32-10144. 4.1.4.  Use  AF  Form  4386,  Utility  Service  Agreement  for  Privatized  Military  Family Housing,  to  provide  service  to  privatized  housing  owners.    The  MAJCOM  Civil  Engineer approves  the  AF  Form  4386  to  provide  service  to  military  HP  projects.    Installations receiving Federal power electricity must coordinate with AFCEC to ensure that privatization does not result in the loss of the federal power allocation.  (T-2) 4.1.5.  Ensure the purchaser complies with facility energy conservation procedures.  Inspect modifications  and  additions  the  purchaser  makes  to  their  facilities  for  facility  energy efficiency and conservation. 4.1.6.  Keep the rewriting of utility sales agreements to a minimum.  Utility sales agreements are in effect until terminated by either party by providing thirty (30) days advance written notification to the other party.  When adding, deleting or changing addresses for activities listed in AF Form 3553 and AF Form 3554, attach a memorandum signed by the BCE to the existing  AF  Form  rather  than  creating  a  new  sales  agreement.    It  is  not  necessary  to supersede,  rewrite,  or  issue  a  new  AF  Form  3553  or  AF  Form  3554  when  making  minor changes or additions. 4.2.  Reimbursement.  AFI  65-601,  Budget  Guidance  and  Procedures,  requires  utility reimbursement to ensure correct cost accounting.  All applicable utility usages are examined to include  applicable  equipment  (e.g.,  vending  machines,  batting  cages,  etc.)  as  well  as  facility usages.    Installations  should  show  full  diligence  to  correctly  account  for  all  applicable reimbursements.  Where noted in reimbursement schedules, use of appropriated funds does not only directly equate to Civil Engineer funding, but also any available appropriated funding. 4.3.  Restrictions.  If  the  installation  commander  sells  utilities  and  related  services  to  a  non-Federal  organization  on  or  in  the  immediate  vicinity  of  an  Air  Force  installation,  all  of  the following must apply:  (T-1) 4.3.1.  The sale serves the interest of national defense or the public interest. 4.3.2.  The  service  is  not  available  from  local  private  or  public  suppliers  (the  person responsible  for  utilities  management  makes  this  determination  annually;  if  there  is  a  local source, the BCE discontinues service as soon as possible).  An exception to this requirement is  that  service  to  privatized  Military  Family  Housing  (MFH)  can  be  provided  even  if available locally.  (10 USC §2872[a]). 4.3.3.  The sale does not disrupt present or planned service to the Air Force. 4.3.4.  Any minor expansion or extension of Air Force utility distribution systems or facilities needed  to  make  the  sale  does  not  hinder  the  construction  of  similar  public  or  private facilities. 4.3.5.  The service is sold to the purchaser for their consumption, not for resale.  AFI32-1061  27 JANUARY 2016   21  4.4.  Utilities Without Reimbursement.

Air  Force  Museums  and  Air  Force  Heritage  Centers  are  provided  utilities  without charge (AFI 84-103, US Air Force Heritage Program). 4.5.  Provided  With  Reimbursement.  Provide  utilities  with  reimbursement  to  organizations required by any  DoD or Air  Force policy, directives, regulations, or instructions to reimburse appropriated funds for utilities.  The Air Force pays for the utility service from its own funds and is later reimbursed by the customer.  A written USA is mandatory (except for medical, housing, and  other  organizations  that  are  members  of  the  same  wing  as  the  BCE  where  a  fund  cite  is adequate  for  reimbursement).    The  customer  reimburses  the  Air  Force  within  thirty  (30)  days after the Air Force bills the customer, or as otherwise provided in the USA entered into with the customer.        Review  documents  such  as  the  base  telephone  directory,  real  property  records, leases,  and  support  agreements  can  be  used  to  identify  new  customers.    Possible  customers purchasing utility services from the Air Force include: 4.5.1.  DoD  Agencies.    The  customer  may  pay  in  advance  for  an  estimated  utility consumption or may reimburse the Air Force within thirty (30) days after the invoice date.  Specify payment terms in the support agreement.  The following are common DoD federal agencies reimbursing the Air Force for utilities: 4.5.1.1.  Category C MWR and AAFES occupying CONUS bases pay in advance for an estimated  utility  consumption,  when  appropriated  funding  is  not  available.    DoD Financial Management Regulation (FMR) treats these customers as “public/non-federal” for purposes of payment to APF due to lack of budgetary authority.  This “public/non-federal” status does not apply to other parts of this AFI.  Remote and isolated CONUS locations listed in AFI 65-106 are exempt from paying utilities.  Note:  Category C MWR activities do not reimburse for sewage, refuse collection, and disposal service.  AAFES activities  are  exempt  from  sewage  but  reimburse  for  refuse  collection  and  disposal service. 4.5.1.2.  Medical Units and Organizations. 4.5.1.3.  Government-Owned MFH. 4.5.1.4.

The  customer  may  pay  in  advance  for  an  estimated utility consumption or may reimburse the Air Force within thirty (30) days after the invoice date.  Specify payment terms in the support agreement.  The following are common non-DoD federal agencies reimbursing the Air Force for utilities: 4.5.2.1.  United States Post Office. 4.5.2.2.  Federal Emergency Management Agency. 4.5.2.3.  Homeland Security. 4.5.2.4.  Drug Enforcement Agency. 4.5.2.5.  Department of Energy. 4.5.3.  Non-Federal/Commercial Organizations.  Non-federal and commercial organizations not exempted by separate instructions and using facility space on other than an occasional basis  must  reimburse  the  Air  Force  for  utilities  IAW  AFI  34-223.    Many  private organizations  are  exempted  from  reimbursing  utilities  under  separate  instructions  that  are specific  to  the  organization,  therefore,  before  charging  for  utilities,  research  the  Air  Force Instructions  applicable  to  the  organization.    The  following  are  common  non-federal customers reimbursing the Air Force for utilities: 4.5.3.1.  Public elementary and secondary schools. 4.5.3.2.  Private schools. 4.5.3.3.  Privatized housing owners (AFI 32-6007). 4.5.3.4.  Occupants of privately owned mobile homes (AFI 32-6001). 4.5.3.5.  Government civilian employees renting Government quarters (AFI 32-9003). 4.5.3.6.  Occupants  of  military  housing  projects  insured  by  the  Government  under  12 USC §1701, National Housing Act, and Section 810, Projects (Wherry Housing). 4.5.3.7.  Credit unions and banks (AFI 32-9003) unless exempted in separate instructions. 4.5.3.8.  Civil  Air  Patrol  (AFI  10-2701,  Organization  and  Function  of  the  Civil  Air Patrol). 4.5.3.9.  Any  person  or  organization  that  connects  equipment,  devices,  or  appliances operated for private gain to the installation's utility system. 4.5.3.10.  Contractors  working  on  an  installation  and  their  contract  does  not  provide Government furnished utilities. 4.6.  Selling  Water  to  Non-Federal  Customers.  The regulatory status  under the  Federal  and state Safe Drinking Water Act may be negatively impacted when water is sold to non-Federal customers. Coordinate with the base bioenvironmental engineer and the environmental manager to determine regulatory controls of selling safe drinking water. 4.7.  Base  Closure  Locations.  AFCEC  determines  the  utility  rates  for  local  redevelopment authorities at bases undergoing closure.   24  AFI32-1061  27 JANUARY 2016 4.7.1.  AFCEC establishes a sales utility rate that maximizes reimbursement to the Air Force yet  is  economical  for  local  redevelopment.    AFCEC  updates  the  sales  rate  if  there  is  a significant change in conditions (such as increase in reuse). 4.7.2.  The utility sales rate may be no less than the local prevailing rate for similar services. 4.8.  Utility  Reimbursement  Rates.  Use  AF  Form  3556,  Utility  Sales  Rates  Computation Worksheet, to compute utility rates.  Until this form is updated on the Air Force e-Publishing website, contact AFCEC directly for the current version.  For information on how to calculate utility reimbursement rates, see AFPAM 32-10144. 4.9.  Wheeling Charge.  A wheeling charge is applicable when an on-base tenant or privatized contractor  purchases  utility  service  directly  from  the  local  utility  service  provider.    The Government  may  allow  utility  suppliers  to  use  Government-owned,  distribution  systems  to transport utilities to on-base organizations with extremely large utility consumption if adequate capacity  is  available.    The  contracting  officer  adds  a  wheeling  charge  provision  to  the  utility contract.    Most  utility  suppliers  may  not  agree  to  wheel  due  to  the  expense  of  installing  and reading  meters,  obtaining  security  to  get  on  base,  and  processing  monthly  utility  bills.    It  is usually more advantageous to the Government for suppliers to wheel to non-Federal customers with  extremely  large  utility  consumption  such  as  a  privately  owned  industrial  plant  or  large privately owned hotel.  It is not advantageous to wheel to small users such as banks and credit unions.    The  base  Energy  Manager  will  verify  proper  wheeling  amounts  are  deducted  on  the monthly invoice, and annually recalculate the wheeling charge.  (T-2)  The contracting officer will modify the utility service contract no later than 1 January each year to update the wheeling charge.  (T-2)  For more details, see AFPAM 32-10144. 4.10.  Utility Invoices and Payment.  The Installation Management Flight will process invoices for  reimbursement.    (T-3)    The  Energy  Manager  must  provide  the  funds  manager  a  monthly spreadsheet showing the customer, consumption, and reimbursement rate no later than ten (10) days  after  the  utility  provider  billing  date.    (T-3)    The  funds  manager  prepares  the  invoices.  Depending on the base billing process, the Installation Management Flight or DFAS mails the invoices to the reimbursable customer.  The Installation Management Flight ensures customers are reimbursing for utilities and paying late fees if applicable. 4.11.  Billing  Waivers.  The  Energy  Manager  may  waive  billings  for  Air  Force,  DoD  and Federal customers when the accumulated charges for a reimbursable customer are less than $125 for  any  calendar  quarter.    EXCEPTION:  This  waiver  does  not  apply  and  billing  may  not  be waived for DWCF or non-Federal customers.  (AFI 65-601) 4.12.  Utility  Reimbursable  Rate  Review.  The Installation Management Flight will complete AF Form 3557, Utility Service Annual Review, no later than 1 January of each year, to record the annual  review  and  changes  in  utility  agreements  and  rates.    (T-3)    Keep  a  copy  of  the  latest annual  review  and  a  record  of  the  action  taken  to  resolve  any  problems  or  recommendations resulting from the annual review. AFI32-1061  27 JANUARY 2016   25  Chapter 5 MEASURING UTILITY COMMODITY CONSUMPTION 5.1.  Meters.  A vital component of the Air Force’s Facility Energy program is measuring utility usage  by  installing  meters  (electric,  natural  gas,  steam,  and  water)  where  appropriate,  thus allowing for informed decisions and improved facility energy efficiency. Meters are mandatory at all existing facilities when feasibility criteria are met.  See AFPAM 32-10144 for details. 5.1.1.  DoDI 4170.11, Enclosure 3, requires the services to develop a MDMP specific to their installations.    Specific  metering  requirements  are  frequently  updated  by  EO,  legislation, directives,  instructions,  and  other  policy  documents.    Refer  to  AFPAM  32-10144  for guidance  on  implementing  the  AF  MDMP,  including  milestones  for  installing  advanced meters  and  Advanced  Meter  Reading  System  (AMRS)  as  a  cyber-secure  tool  to  manage utility consumption data, change behavior, and achieve greater facility energy efficiencies at Air Force installations. 5.1.2.  Utility  purchase  contracts  have  provisions  specifying  meter  calibration  and  refunds due the  Government when meters are not  calibrated correctly.  The base Energy Manager will keep a copy of the latest meter calibration test for each meter in the utility service folder.  (T-3)  Calibration for meters owned by the utility provider is the responsibility of the utility provider. 5.2.  Meter Installation.  Meters with interval and remote reading capabilities are mandatory on all  new  construction  and  utility  system  renovation  projects  exceeding  $200K  IAW  DoDI 4170.11, Enclosure 3, paragraph 3d(2)(b). 5.2.1.  DoDI 4170.11, Enclosure 3, paragraph 3d(2) requires meters at all existing facilities when cost effective. 5.2.2.  Electricity, natural gas, and water are metered on appropriate facilities and steam is metered at steam plants IAW DoDI 4170.11, Enclosure 3, paragraph 3d(2)(a).  For details on metering potable water, see AFPAM 32-10144 and for details on metering steam plants, see AFI 32-1068, Heating Systems and Unfired Pressure Vessels. 5.2.3.  Installations will  meter Government-owned family housing using  a master metering system according to Military Handbook 1190, Facility Planning and Design Guide, Chapter 13, paragraph 12.  (T-1) 5.2.3.1.  Meter  privately  owned  (privatized)  MFH  areas.    As  a  minimum,  the  PO  shall install a master meter at the point of demarcation located between the base utility system and the housing area utility system.  (T-1)  These instructions prevail unless otherwise stated in the applicable USA. 5.2.3.2.  The privatized housing area meters are purchased and installed using the PO’s funds, but ensure meters meet Unified Facility Guide Specifications requirements and the BCE approves installation of the meter.  The PO will ensure meters are installed within thirty (30) days after contract award for the privatized housing or as otherwise provided in the USA entered into with the customer.  (T-3)   26  AFI32-1061  27 JANUARY 2016 5.2.3.3.  The  government  shall  purchase  and  install  meters  on  government-owned facilities located within privatized military housing areas. 5.3.  Meter Consumption Data and Reading.  Until advanced meters are fully operational and provide  daily  consumption  data,  installations  will  ensure  meter  consumption  data  is  collected monthly and, if possible, on the same day the local utility provider reads the base master delivery point meter.  (T-3)  The Energy Manager uses the facility meter data to determine reimbursable customer consumption for utility resale billing. 5.3.1.  The  Energy  Manager  also  uses  Advanced  Meter  Reading  (AMR)  consumption  data for  facility  energy  conservation  monitoring,  analyses,  benchmarking,  trending,  and  other management  concepts  required  to  execute  facility  energy-based  decisions  as  part  of  asset management. 5.3.2.  Ensure  meter  readings  include  type  meter,  meter  identification  number,  meter location;  multiplier  and  unit  of  measurement;  prior  and  present  month's  reading  and  date; number  of  days  between  readings;  consumption;  and  signature  and  phone  number  of  the meter reader.  Use the daily average consumption of any representative period in the event a meter fails. 5.3.3.  Keep  meter  data  and  billing  information  for  the  last  24  months  easily  accessible.  Store all meter information electronically for 7  years.  The Energy Manager will annually check the information to determine if consumption is nearing the utility system capacity.  (T-2) 5.3.4.  If actual consumption is nearing capacity, coordinate with the Engineering Flight to analyze the infrastructure for possible capital improvements.  Coordinate with the community planning function and the programming flight to determine future requirements. 5.4.  Utility  Meters  and  Industrial  Control  Systems.  AMR  utility  meters  connected  to  any Government-owned local area network (LAN) may not be owned by or conveyed to the SO.  If an  AMRS  is  not  available  and  the  installation  is  not  programmed  to  receive  AMRS,  the installation may request a waiver from AFCEC to transfer the AMR meters to the SO.  Ensure the waiver request includes a plan for the  required meter data to be transferred to the Energy Manager.  If the waiver is approved, and the UP contract requires the SO to send meter data to the COR, AMR meters may be conveyed to the SO only after being disconnected or disabled from the AF LAN.  Ensure Industrial Control Systems (ICS) including Supervisory Control and Data  Acquisition  are  also  evaluated  to  determine  if  they  will  be  conveyed  to  a  SO.    All government-owned  electric  and  gas  meters  connected  to  the  AF  LAN  must  meet  Unified Facilities Guide Specifications, are compatible with the AF AMRS, and as required by current DoD  Directives  and  EOs  or  by  Air  Force  policy,  directives,  regulations,  or  instructions.    The installation Energy Manager must confirm which meters are mandatory.  (T-0) 5.4.1.  Existing  Utility  Services  Contracts.    Modify  and  re-negotiate  an  existing  utility services contract that has conveyed required meters to a SO to delete the meters from the SO inventory and return them to Government ownership, if cost effective. 5.4.2.  Existing Utility Services solicitations.  When a utility system with required meters in the inventory is to be conveyed, AFCEC must provide the contracting officer with a revised Section JA so the solicitation can be amended to delete conveyance of the meters.  (T-1) AFI32-1061  27 JANUARY 2016   27  5.4.3.  Utility Service Contract in Transition.  When a utility services contract is currently in the  transition  phase,  remove  the  required  meters  from  the  final  inventory  as  soon  as practicable.  This guidance is covered in greater detail in the UP Playbook. 5.4.4.  ICS.  ICSs that are conveyed to a SO can only be connected to a government LAN if it complies  with  cybersecurity  protocols  and  certificate  of  net  worthiness.    (Any  ICS  that  is conveyed to a SO cannot be connected to the base or any government-owned LAN.  Evaluate the ICS for network security issues before conveyance to a SO.) 5.5.  Utility Consumption Estimating.  Estimate present and future requirements (consumption) as  realistically  as  possible.    Consider  temporary  meters  for  estimating  facilities  that  consume large quantities of facility energy and water. 5.5.1.  Overestimation of requirements (consumption) results in excessive connection charges and unreasonable minimum charges.  When actual demand is below the contract minimum demand, the installation pays for more service than it actually uses. 5.5.2.  Underestimation of requirements (consumption) results in inadequate plant and system capacity,  additional  connection  charges,  and  a  higher  unit  cost  for  service  based  on  a  low consumption rate schedule. 5.5.3.  Prepare  a  detailed  engineering  estimate  for  utility  consumption  for  each  facility  (or customer)  without  a  functioning  meter.  Consumption  estimates  include  the  parking  lot lighting that belongs to the facility but does not include street lighting.  Use temporary meters to  estimate  utility  consumption  when  feasible.    Consumption  estimates  are  effective  1 January of each year. 5.6.  Electricity and Natural Gas Estimating.  Use the Energy Use Intensity (EUI) information if  available.    If  not  available,  consider  using  similar  EUIs  on  similar  facilities.    Account  for weather, occupancy, and scheduling effects.  See AFPAM 32-10144 for details. 5.7.  Water and Wastewater Estimating.  If possible, use temporary meters to estimate water consumption;  otherwise,  use  the  best  estimate  possible  based  on  the  guidelines  in  the  Federal Water Use Indices.  See The Air Force Water Conservation Guidebook for details.   28  AFI32-1061  27 JANUARY 2016 Chapter 6 UTILITIES PRIVATIZATION (UP) 6.1.  UP  Authority  and  Directive.  10  USC  §2688  grants  the  Secretary  of  each  Military Department the authority to convey a utility system and to enter into a utility services contract.  DoDI  4170.11,  Enclosure  3,  paragraph  3e,  requires  each  DoD  Component  to  “complete privatization decisions on all electric, water, wastewater, and natural gas systems” and attempt to privatize each system. 6.1.1.  Exemption  from  Privatization.    The  Air  Force  may  declare  a  utility  system  exempt from  privatization  for  unique  mission  or  security  reasons  or  when  the  privatization  is determined  to  be  uneconomical.    Refer  to  OSD  policy  letters  and  the  UP  Playbook  for details. 6.1.2.  Water Rights.  Air Force installations should only privatize their water systems when they  can  do  so  without  relinquishing  or  transferring  water  rights  as  a  condition  of privatization.    In  no  case  may  the  Air  Force  abandon,  relinquish,  forfeit  or  otherwise prejudice its water rights in conjunction with a utilities privatization contract or conveyance.  If privatization causes any such impact on Air Force water rights, then exempt the system from UP for national security reasons. 6.1.3.  Depot-Level  Industrial  Wastewater  Treatment  Plants  (IWTPs).    Depot-level  IWTPs are not to be included in the privatization of a wastewater system. 6.1.4.  Utility Meters.  Any AMR utility meters required to be installed by Air Force policy on electric, gas or water systems, whether currently connected to the government’s LAN or not, may not be conveyed as part of a privatized system. 6.2.  UP Goal and Purpose.  The goal of the Air Force UP program is to permanently convey utility systems on active, AFRC, and ANG installations to private or public utility companies in conjunction with award of a long-term utility services contract for the operation and maintenance of those systems.  The purpose of privatizing a utility system is to restore utility infrastructure to industry  standards  for  operations,  maintenance,  recapitalization,  health,  and  safety  while achieving a monetary savings over the cost of continued Air Force ownership. 6.3.  UP Procedures. 6.3.1.  Conveyance and Contracting. Utility systems authorized for privatization are defined in 10 USC §2688.  OSD and the Air Force focus primarily on electric, natural gas, water, and wastewater systems; however, other utility systems are authorized for privatization, including steam,  hot  and  chilled  water,  and  telecommunications  systems.    UP  for  any  utility  system privatized under 10 USC §2688 is the result of two decisions:  (1) the decision to convey the utility  infrastructure  and  (2)  the  decision  to  contract  for  utility  services  on  the  conveyed system. 6.3.1.1.  Solicitation  for  Privatization.  Conduct  solicitations  and  contracting  activities IAW the FAR and its supplements. AFI32-1061  27 JANUARY 2016   29  6.3.1.1.1.  Solicitations  for  privatization  of  utility  systems  include  whole  systems.  Systems  may  not  be  “partially  privatized.”    Integral  system  components,  such  as grease traps, transformers, lift stations, etc., should be included in the inventory to be conveyed and privatized. 6.3.1.1.2.  DLA Energy is the Air Force contracting agent for UP. 6.3.1.2.  Conveyance  Decision.  A decision to  convey  a utility system  requires support using a comparison of the cost of continued Air Force ownership of the utility system over the term of a projected utility services contract (the GSCE) to the Life Cycle Cost (LCC) of privatization.  If the LCC for privatization is higher than the GSCE, then the utility system should not be conveyed unless compelling justification exists for the Air Force  to  pay  more  than  the  GSCE.    Conveyance  decision  process  and  guidance  is outlined in the UP Playbook. 6.3.1.3.  Utility  Services  Contract.    After  the  conveyance  decision  is  made  and documented,  and  as  a  final  result  of  the  solicitation  effort,  a  contract  is  executed  for utility  services  from  the  privatization  entity  to  who  the  infrastructure  was  conveyed.  Utility  services  contracts  for  privatized  utility  systems  normally  consist  of  operation, maintenance, repair, upgrade, and recapitalization. 6.3.2.  Transition  to  Conveyance.    The  transition  period  is  the  period  between  the  utility services contract award date and the date that the privatization entity begins to service the utility  system.    During  this  period,  a  comprehensive  inventory  of  the  utility  system  is compiled by the Air Force and the privatization entity.  The transition period ends with (1) the  conveyance  of  the  utility  system  infrastructure  from  the  Air  Force  via  a  BoS  to  the privatization entity, which then becomes the SO and (2) the start of contract execution.  The BoS  lists  the  completed  inventory.    Each  installation  will  ensure  the  BoS  with  original signatures  by  the  Air  Force  and  SO  representatives  is  forwarded  to,  and  retained  by, SAF/GCN.  (T-1) 6.3.3.  Post-Conveyance. 6.3.3.1.  Real Property Record Updates.  Installations will update real property records no later than sixty (60) days after the effective date of the applicable BoS.  (T-1) 6.3.3.2.  Post  Conveyance  Reviews.    Conduct  post  conveyance  reviews  IAW  DoDI 4170.11, Enclosure 3, paragraph 3e(2) and supplemental procedures outlined in the UP Playbook.  Additionally, installations will ensure post conveyance reviews ascertain the following:  (T-1) 6.3.3.2.1.  If  post-conveyance  (actual)  expenditures,  costs,  and  financial  execution data for the conveyed utility system are consistent with pre-conveyance data in the SO’s proposal and GSCE. 6.3.3.2.2.  If  utility  system  reliability  has  been  restored  to  equal  to,  or  better  than, industry standard. 6.3.3.3.  BoS Amendments.  Conveyancing of additional utility infrastructure completed by the Air Force or by a third party contractor to the Air Force after the effective date of the BoS is done as an amendment to the BoS.  The amendment includes a comprehensive inventory of the additional system components conveyed to the SO.   30  AFI32-1061  27 JANUARY 2016 6.3.4.  Environmental Studies to Support UP. 6.3.4.1.  An Environmental Baseline Survey (EBS) is not required for those areas that are subject to non-exclusive use under a right of access.  An EBS is mandatory for areas that the privatization entity will use exclusively, such as plants or substations. 6.3.4.2.  When a privatization action qualifies for application of a categorical exclusion (CATEX),  the  CATEX  should  be  applied.   An  Environmental  Assessment  or Environmental  Impact  Statement  should  only  be  prepared  when  the  action  does  not qualify for application of a CATEX. 6.4.  UP Funding and Programming. 6.4.1.  Once  a  system  is  privatized,  all  operation,  maintenance,  utility  services,  and recapitalization requirements are provided by the SO and are programmed and funded as a utility  services  contract  (normally  FAR  Part  41)  through  the  Facility  Operations  (FO) program element fund source.  See UP Playbook for details. 6.4.2.  UP  funding  in  support  of  MILCON,  Minor  Construction,  or  Repair  Projects.  Connection  fees  and/or  installation  of  new  inventory  are  programmed  and  funded  by  the respective  project.    Subsequent  O&M  and  recapitalization  of  the  new  inventory  is programmed  and  funded  annually  by  UP  funds. is  mandatory  for adding/deleting system inventory and connections to privatized systems as outlined in AFI 32-1021, Planning and Programming Military Construction (MILCON) Projects and/or the UP Playbook.   Compliance 6.5.  UP  in  HP.  AFI  32-6007  should  be  followed  in  conjunction  with  this  publication  in  all privatized  housing  areas  because  ownership  situations  and  operational  criteria  vary  from installation to installation.  Refer to the UP Playbook for details. 6.5.1.  HP  Waiver  Authority.    The  authority  to  waive  wing/unit  level  requirements  in  this publication,  as  identified  with  Tier  numbers,  does  not  apply  to  any  term,  condition  or requirement in existing HP leases or agreements.  The approval authority for waivers to HP documents are outlined in Air Force delegation of statutory authority letters applicable to HP.  A waiver or modification to any term, condition or requirement in a USA or other binding HP agreement may only be accomplished by mutual agreement of the Air Force and the PO.  JOHN B.

Code UP—Utilities Privatization   35  Terms Bill of Sale—The document/instrument used to convey or transfer all of the Government's right, title  and  interest  in  all  or  part  of  a  utility  system  at  an  installation.    After  it  is  signed  by  the Conveyance Authority and the System Owner, the effective date of the Bill of Sale is the date of the conveyance.  (See Conveyance) Capital Investment, Capital Cost—Capital costs can include costs for land, taxes, surveying, construction, inspection, materials, and labor.  The total capital costs are the original costs to the government  to  construct/install  the  plant,  distribution  system,  or  collection  system;  any additional upgrade, alteration or addition costs; and repair by replacement costs.  The net repair by replacement costs are reduced by the original construction costs of the portion replaced. Certified Economic Analysis—The life cycle cost economic analysis that the Air Force uses to evaluate cost of continued Government ownership verses the privatization alternative.  Certified means approved by the Utilities Privatization Program Management Office. Connection  Charge—A  fee  paid  by  a  utility  customer  to  cover  the  costs  of  connecting household or commercial service to utility service lines. Conveyance—The legal transfer of all of the Government's right, title and interest in all or part of a utility system to the System Owner.  (See Bill of Sale) Conveyance Analysis—The process and analytical tools used by the Conveyance Authority to determine if it is in the best interest of the Air Force to transfer the utility system to the offeror selected by the Source Selection Authority. Conveyance Authority—The Secretary of the Air Force or designee granted authority under 10 USC §2688 to convey utility systems under the jurisdiction of the Secretary. Conveyance  Decision—The  Conveyance  Authority  makes  the  decision  to  convey  or  not  to convey  a  utility  system  and,  if  the  decision  is  to  convey,  signs  the  Conveyance  Decision Document. Conveyance Decision Document—Written instrument signed by the Conveyance Authority that documents the conveyance decision.  (See Conveyance Analysis) Cost Of Service—Means the cost of providing a service.  Cost-of-service pricing is the setting of a price for a service based on the costs incurred in providing it.  Cost of service pricing can be applied  to  an  individual  customer  based  on  the  costs  of  serving  that  customer  (usually  this  is done only with large-scale customers or customers who are costly to serve), or as an average cost of service for a group of similar customers (also called a customer class or category).   36  AFI32-1061  27 JANUARY 2016 Distribution  System—Refers to the combination of the physical hardware required to deliver the commodity to end-use customers and the procedures and processes used to perform the actual delivery. Facility  Energy  Security—Air  Force  installation  facility  energy  security  is  an  assured, sustainable,  resilient,  and  sufficient  energy  supply.    The  defining  characteristics  are  surety, sustainability, sufficiency, and supply.  Surety is reliable, available, and secure energy delivery.  Sustainability  is  a  survivable,  safe,  operable,  and  maintainable  infrastructure.    Sufficiency provides the right level of energy surety for the mission.  Supply is an efficient, affordable, and diverse source of energy. Fixed Cost—A fixed cost is a production- or transmission-related expense which must be paid regardless of whether the energy is produced or sold.  Fixed costs can include capital costs, labor and maintenance charges, taxes and demand charges among others. Government  Should  Cost  Estimate—The  cost  of  Government  ownership  at  the  level  of  the Government “should” be spending for the proper sustainment and restoration of a utility system based on industry standards rather than what is actually being spent. Housing Privatization—Conversion of Government housing to privatized housing through the authorities in 10 USC §2871 and §2885, as amended. Initial System Deficiency Corrections—Those projects and associated costs necessary to bring a utility system up to the standards typically maintained by industry or to ensure compliance with applicable law, so that subsequent renewals and replacements will permit the long-term safe and reliable operation of the utility system. Master  Metering—A  method  of  metering  the  use  of  a  utility  in  which  multiple  buildings  or customers  are  all  metered  cumulatively  on  the  same  meter.    For  example,  a  condominium  on master metering would receive one facility energy bill for all condo owners measured through that meter. Operations  and  Maintenance—(Department  of  Defense)  Maintenance  and  repair  of  real property,  operation  of  utilities,  and  provision  of  other  services  such  as  refuse  collection  and disposal, entomology, snow removal, and ice alleviation.

Reimbursable Utilities—Transaction by which the Air Force receives funds from tenants or on-base organizations for a utility service. Renewals  and  Replacements—The  investments  in  a  utility  system  to  refurbish,  overhaul  or replace system components that fail or reach the end of their useful life. 43—Attachments to requests for proposal containing installation-specific information. Sole Benefit Test—The test used to determine whether the Air Force will charge a PO/customer for any operations, maintenance or repair costs associated with system infrastructure owned by the Air Force.  Under the Sole Benefit Test, if system infrastructure owned by the Air Force is solely  benefiting  a  PO/customer,  the  Air  Force  charges  the  PO/customer  for  the  operations, maintenance  and  repair  costs  for  that  portion  of  the  system  infrastructure.    For  further information on this process, please see AFPAM 32-10144. AFI32-1061  27 JANUARY 2016   37  Source  Selection  Authority—The  individual  designated  to  make  the  best-value  decision  to privatize an Air Force utility system.  The Source Selection Authority is commensurate with the complexity and dollar value of the acquisition.  For acquisitions with a total estimated value of $100M  or  more,  the  Source  Selection  Authority  shall  be  an  individual  other  than  the Procurement Contracting Officer. Source  Selection  Advisory  Council—The  Source  Selection  Authority  establishes  the  Source Selection  Advisory  Council  to  gain  access  to  functional  area  expertise  to  provide  support throughout the source selection process, and is established for acquisitions with a total estimated value of $100M or more. Source Selection Decision Document—The document that memorializes the Source Selection Authority’s  independent  determination  whether  to  award  or  not  to  award  a  utility  services contract to a privatization entity. Source  Selection  Plan—Provides  a  written  guide  for  the  source  selection  team,  emphasizing source selection procedure and setting forth the standards by which the team evaluates proposals.  It reflects the timetable for contract execution and how the Government solicits proposals from industry, evaluates and rate proposals, conducts discussions/negotiations, selects the successful offeror for award, and protects source selection records. System Owner—An entity that (1) receives a conveyance of a utility system from the Air Force and  (2)  is  awarded  a  utility  services  contract  to  operate,  maintain,  and  recapitalize  that  same utility system. Utilities  Privatization—Conveyance of Government-owned utility systems (primarily electric, gas, water, or wastewater) to a non-Federal entity through the definitions and authorities of 10 USC  §2688,  as  amended,  along  with  a  long-term  contract  to  own,  operate,  maintain,  and recapitalize that utility system. Wheeling—When a utility or facility energy distribution company delivers, or wheels, energy from the transmission system to an end-use customer, it is referred to as retail wheeling. When a customer who also generates energy produces energy at one site, transports it across someone else's facilities and consumes it at another site, it is referred to as self-service wheeling.
