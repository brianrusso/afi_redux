In this evolutionary process, we need tocontinually learn better ways of instruction.MissionobjectiveOne objective of the Air Force is training personnel to meet missionrequirements.  Therefore, to help fulfill that objective, we must:Source-  Apply the best methods in all phases of education and training.-  Continuously evaluate those methods to ensure quality is totallyintegrated.Education and training efficiency and effectiveness result when quality isintegrated.In 1988, the Department of the Navy, in an attempt to improve theirEducation and Background Training Program, ventured out to see whateducational techniques and automated tools were being used in thecivilian classroom.The result of their effort was the publishing of  "What Works - ASummary of Research Findings with Implications for Navy Instructionand Learning" (Montague, 1988).  The Navy allowed us to borrow theirpublication findings in order for us to create our own volume.PurposeMany of you will find what is suggested in this volume to be commonsense.  However, common sense is not necessarily common practice.  Theinformation contained in this volume has four purposes:- - It serves as a reminder and guide to implement improvements withinthe constraints of current education and training situations.It provides information to assist with the long-term planning foreducation and training improvement.Continued on next page4Purpose(Continued)LimitationsGoalAFH 36-2235, Volume 2   2 SEPTEMBER 2002- - It provides the Education and Training Manager, Instructor andSpecialist with a myriad of techniques proven effective to improve thequality of instructional programs.It provides several automated tools currently in the Air ForceInventory that could enhance the classroom learning experience.We know these techniques and automated tools are not inclusive.  Youmay not be able to apply some of these techniques and tools in all of theAir Force Education and Training centers of learning.Our goal is to provide a forum to exchange classroom-proven practices,which will increase knowledge and skill retention, yielding greater jobproficiency as well as mission readiness.RevisionsPlease send us your proven techniques and tools so we may incorporatethem in future revisions.AFH 36-2235, Volume  2  2 SEPTEMBER 20025EDUCATION and TRAINING TECHNIQUESChapter 2OverviewIntroductionEducation and Training involves a diversity of personnel working invarious capacities, as the previous matrix points out.  This section will lookat the instructional techniques that relate to all education and trainingpersonnel; however, for ease in reference, three major categories are used:instructional managers, instructors, and specialists.Where to readabout itThis chapter contains three sections.SectionTitleABCTechniques for Instructional ManagersTechniques for InstructorsTechniques for Instructional  SpecialistsPage636606AFH 36-2235, Volume 2   2 SEPTEMBER 2002Section ATechniques for Instructional ManagersWhere to readabout itThe following topical index is provided as a quick reference to thissection.TopicEffective SchoolsManaging InstructorsEvaluating and Supervising InstructorsManaging StudentsMonitoring and TailoringEvaluation and RevisionImitating the Job EnvironmentMaintaining Skills and KnowledgeStudent and Instructor RatiosManaging Informal LearningPlanning for ChangeCost EffectivenessStructuring and Sequencing InstructionSelf Paced InstructionInteractive CoursewareVideo TechnologiesSimulatorsDevelopment and Use of SimulatorsDistributed Learning and Tele-trainingAdopting ChangeManaging ChangeConclusionPage78910111314161819202224252628293031333435AFH 36-2235, Volume  2  2 SEPTEMBER 20027Effective SchoolsImportant findingEffective schools focus sharply on students and learning.Effective instructionInstructional managers and instructors can increase instructional qualityby implementing policies that encourage effective instruction as:-  They emphasize frequent testing, testing of job-like performance,critical job skills, and safety practices.-  They encourage effective time management to reduce or eliminatetime spent on activities irrelevant to training objectives.-  They maximize interaction between students and instructors, learningmaterials and learning tasks.Students must be psychologically and physically comfortable.  Longlectures requiring prolonged periods of sitting without opportunities forpractice inhibit effective learning.Managers must work with instructors, students, and the operationalcommunity to develop and establish a positive learning environment thatwill become a lasting part of the school’s tradition.Instructors must collaborate in developing goals, sharing advice aboutteaching, and emphasizing student achievement, instruction as well asstudents’ performance improves.StudentsManagersInstructors8AFH 36-2235, Volume 2   2 SEPTEMBER 2002Managing InstructorsImportant findingEffective instructional management policies improve instructors’ training,student performance, and time management.Effective managers With instructional improvement as a constant theme, effective managersshould:-  Scrutinize existing practices to ensure instructor training contributesto the quality of instructional programs.-  Provide instructors with the opportunity to improve theirinstructional and classroom management techniques.-  Develop policies to support instructor requirements by encouragingnew ideas.-  Ensure the availability of instructional materials and assistanceinstructors need.-  Work to raise instructor morale and create a climate of achievement.-  Allow instructors to participate in policy formation processes.AFH 36-2235, Volume  2  2 SEPTEMBER 20029Evaluating and Supervising InstructorsManagersManagers enhance instructors’ teaching skills by:-  Making frequent and systematic classroom observations.-  Providing relevant, timely feedback that includes suggestions forcorrecting weaknesses and praise strengths.-  Ensuring instructors know the subject matter and can teach it well.-  Providing new instructors opportunities to practice under supervisedconditions.SupervisionSupervision that strengthens instruction has the following elements:-  The supervisor and instructor agree with specific skills and practicesthat characterize effective teaching.-  The supervisor observes the instructor frequently to verify use ofthese skills and practices.-  The supervisor and instructor discuss supervisory observations.-  The supervisor and instructor agree on areas for improvement.-  The supervisor and instructor jointly develop specific improvementplans.Student ratingsManagers can use student ratings of instructors to improve the overallinstructional processes as:-  Ratings may provide useful, constructive feedback.-  Ratings during a course, rather than only at the end, provide theopportunity to modify teaching with the same groups of students.-  Fellow instructors or education/training specialists can help individualinstructors plan how to improve their teaching based on studentfeedback.10AFH 36-2235, Volume 2   2 SEPTEMBER 2002Managing StudentsImportant findingPerformance-oriented leadership improves formal (intentional) andinformal (incidental) learning.Manage learningTo manage learning effectively both inside and outside of the classroom,managers should:-  Ensure that formal learning is developed with systematic procedures.-  Stress the importance of each student’s learning.-  Specify the roles of all personnel in managing learning.-  Personally evaluate the learning environment i.e., who is doing what,when, where, why, and how?  How does the physical learningenvironment affect learning?  What is happening in the school thatshould not be happening?Outside learningStudents learn a lot outside of formal education and training.  Forexample, some students adopt behaviors from instructors duringinstruction; others acquire skills from peers.AFH 36-2235, Volume  2  2 SEPTEMBER 200211Monitoring and TailoringImportant findingInstruction improves when managers monitor achievement indicators,detect when the value of any indicator moves into an unacceptable range,and then take focused, corrective action (tailoring).ControllinginstructionMonitoring and tailoring instructional systems are similar to controllingphysical systems such as heating or cooling systems.  However,education and training system indicators are not as apparent as physicalsystem indicators.System indicatorsEducation and training system indicators are determined by:-  Examining the goals and management practices of the school.-  Obtaining objective information about students and instructors.MonitoringMonitoring focuses on improvement in instructional quality. Trainingmanagers can monitor direct and indirect student performances toestablish priorities for improving the system:-  Monitoring requires access to effective record keeping andconsiderable information processing.-  Monitoring with a computer-based information system, managers canidentify student indicators with values that are in an unacceptablerange.-  Monitoring will reveal whether the quality of instruction is beingimproved.MonitoringindicatorsTraining managers can monitor direct and indirect student performancesto establish priorities for improving the system.  The following indicatorsare helpful in the monitoring process:-  Direct indicators include student attrition, and comprehensive and- performance test scores.Indirect indicators include student-instructor ratios and backgroundvariables.Continued on next page12TailoringConclusionAFH 36-2235, Volume 2   2 SEPTEMBER 2002Focused corrective action or tailoring requires a deployable resource torespond to the indicators.  For example, an instructional supervisor orcurriculum standards office representative might visit a classroom orschool to confirm (or refute) that a problem exists, diagnose thesituation, and propose corrective action.The monitoring and tailoring approach assumes that fine tuning theinstructional system can improve the system significantly.  The systemmay require fundamental changes due to changes in technology,resources, or society.AFH 36-2235, Volume  2  2 SEPTEMBER 200213Evaluation and RevisionImportant findingTryouts during instructional development help identify and correctinadequacies.Student tryoutsEvaluating and revising instruction are important processes.  Thedeveloper accomplishes this by taking segments of material to a sampleof students for tryout.  This developer goes through the material witheach student.  During tryouts, students might be asked about:-  The quantity and quality of examples in the instruction.-  The adequacy of practice opportunities.-  The suitability of media selected for a given education and trainingdomain.-  The compatibility of the reading grade level of the materials and thestudent audience.-  The time required for the student to complete the instructioncompared to the allotted training time.RevisionSummaryThe developer then revises the materials to address problems uncoveredin tryout and conducts another tryout with different students.Instructional development rarely includes this evaluation-revision cycle.Tryout of the materials in nearly final form is more common.  At this latestage, it is difficult to diagnose instructional problems unless a grossfailure makes them apparent.ConclusionThe lack of evaluation during development makes revision of instructiona major undertaking.  Looking at the ISD process as continuousevaluation will help resolve this dilemma.Lesson learnedThe lesson learned is that managers who plan and allocate adequateresources for early evaluation make the revision process and instructionmore effective.14AFH 36-2235, Volume 2   2 SEPTEMBER 2002Imitating the Job EnvironmentImportant findingStudents learn and retain knowledge and skills best when the learningenvironment incorporates the critical, functional features of the workingenvironment.Job transferFor maximum transfer from the education and training environment to awork environment:New built on oldJob performance-  The learning environment should include the context, tasks,procedures, and materials of the job.-  Education and training should relate to the specific job environment,as well as the knowledge the student already has.-  Training should involve the same operations, tools, and machines (ortheir functional equivalents) as the actual job.New knowledge is built on the foundation of old knowledge.  Facilitatinglearning requires that the training relates to the students’ existingknowledge.  Students can use existing knowledge to facilitate learningand correct any misunderstandings of how and why things work the waythey do.  This will help bridge the gap on what new knowledge needs tobe taught.Another important aspect of imitating the job environment is trainingstudents to the level of the job performance requirements.  If the jobrequires much supervision, then students should not be trained to a highlevel--one that does not require supervision.  Effective education andtraining managers should solicit graduate feedback to detectinconsistencies between training levels and job performancerequirements.Tailor to assignment Minimal on-the-job supervision requires higher levels of training. Iftraining and working environments differ in their skill expectations andcloseness of supervision, instruction should be tailored for the expectedassignment.Continued on next pageAFH 36-2235, Volume  2  2 SEPTEMBER 200215Solicit feedbackEffective education and training managers should solicit feedback aboutgraduates to detect problems in mismatches between levels of trainingand expectancies.16AFH 36-2235, Volume 2   2 SEPTEMBER 2002Maintaining Skills and KnowledgeImportant findingMaintaining critical skills requires planned and monitored on-the-jobtraining and testing.Skill lossPoints about skill loss:-  Performance of some procedural skills declines rapidly withoutsystematic refresher training.-  The rate of skill loss differs for different tasks.  The decline suggeststhe need for systematic practice to maintain skills.Example of skill lossFigure 1, taken from Hagman and Rose (1983), shows the decline in thenumber of soldiers able to perform basic soldiering tasks after training.Rate of skill loss differs for different tasks.  The decline suggests theneed for systematic practice to maintain skills.Figure 1.   Rate of Skill Loss.Continued on next pageAFH 36-2235, Volume  2  2 SEPTEMBER 200217Preventing skill lossNormally, schools provide sufficient training for initial job competency.Proficiency is normally developed on-the-job.  The following applies tomaintaining proficiency:-  On-the-job practice of rarely used skills is often lacking.-  Long lapses in training promote losses not improvement of skills and- knowledge.Initial training must include the maximum amount of practicepossible.-  Retraining must be provided at intervals.Estimating skill lossThere is no way to make accurate, quantitative predictions about the rateof skill loss, how fast relearning occurs, or how often retraining shouldoccur.Refresher trainingThe bottom line is that planning and scheduling refresher training isessential.-  Base the spacing of refresher practice sessions for novices on howoften trainees perform the skill or task.-  More than minimal learning should be provided during the originalcourse when refresher training is difficult or too costly to arrange.18AFH 36-2235, Volume 2   2 SEPTEMBER 2002Student and Instructor RatiosImportant findingEnlarging class size in most large basic courses has little effect on studentlearning.  It frees instructors for lab training, tutoring, or counseling.Class sizeClass size has the following relationships to learning:-  Small student-instructor ratios tend to promote frequent interactionsbetween students, instructors, and materials.-  Students in small classes achieve more; they also have more interestin learning.-  When class size exceeds 12 students, fewer opportunities for class- participation exist.In lecture presentations, class size does not make any differencebecause interactions are minimal, even in the informal lecture arena.-  Class size in basic courses, unless it’s below 10 students, does notaffect student learning.  If the class gets so large the student canneither see nor hear the instruction, this will become detrimental tolearning.Ratio managementManagers should occasionally change instructor and student ratios tomaximize instructors and improve student learning.  Merging classes torelieve some instructors can provide additional time for them to performother instructional functions.AFH 36-2235, Volume  2  2 SEPTEMBER 200219Managing Informal LearningImportant findingAggressive management of learning can improve the incidence andquality of informal learning.Informal learningStudents obtain much of their knowledge and skills outside of formaltraining:-  Managers can positively influence informal learning by placing- - instructional information in areas where students frequent(dormitories, cafeterias, etc.).Instructional information should be designed not only to fosterlearning, but also to create awareness and motivation.Instructional requirements can be promoted by placing instructionalmaterials at job sites, requiring reading of job, and education andtraining materials during slack time.-  Students should be encouraged to set aside "read and think" timeduring duty hours.  This will help them to think about what they do,and how to do it better.20AFH 36-2235, Volume 2   2 SEPTEMBER 2002Planning for ChangeImportant findingExploiting communications and computer technologies can serve policygoals and meet education and training needs within resource constraints.CapturingtechnologyMany recent advances in communications and computer technologies canbe used for instructional purposes.  New technology may enable thedelivery of conventional forms of instruction in new ways.Effective use oftechnologyVarious technologies can be used to develop and deliver instruction thatcan be as effective, or more effective than current methods.  To capturetechnological benefits, you must:-  Conduct good planning and analysis.-  Compare cost effectiveness benefits with needs and the current costs- of training.Identify funding for evaluation of new systems designed to makeinstruction more effective.Cost versus impactThe rapid development of new technologies points to the inevitability ofsignificant changes in the way education and training is developed anddelivered.-  Potential costs of these changes require caution and a practicaloutlook.-  Claims of large benefits in effectiveness must be substantiated byconcrete, conclusive empirical evidence.-  Decades of research reveal that improvements in instructionalachievement are usually not due to the communications andcomputer technology but to redesign of the content.-  Permitting each student to learn at his/her own pace, with or withouttechnology, is an important source of the gain.Planning for changePlanners should research the suitability of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf(COTS) products for courseware development and computer-baseddelivery of instruction.  Determine whether software and systems havealready been developed, by industry or internally, that can meet yourtraining needs.Continued on next pageAFH 36-2235, Volume  2  2 SEPTEMBER 200221Caution on bigapplicationsLarge-scale implementation of education and training technologies thatsubstantially change the organization and presentation of instructionshould be undertaken only after formal study of its cost effectiveness.Other referencesThe following paragraphs will present some of the technologies thetraining manager can use to select appropriate media, and to developcourseware.  Chapter 3 will review some of the latest tools, such asDesigner’s Edge.22AFH 36-2235, Volume 2   2 SEPTEMBER 2002Cost EffectivenessImportant findingConsistent and credible evaluations of cost-effectiveness must justify anyplans to substitute alternative education and training programs for thosenow in use.Low costDeclining costs of computer-based and communications technologiesmakes their use in the delivery of instruction a smart move.Must make adifferenceIntroducing new technology must make a difference and not add toincreases in the already high cost of education and training.Must show benefitsTo offset or justify the cost of technology, these benefits should bedemonstrable:- Instructor productivity or the number of students graduated in a timeperiod should increase.-  Student performance should improve substantially.-  Administrative burdens over the life of the system should be reduced.Good planningChanges require good management planning as well as changes in theinstructional program.Cost of alternativesThe decision to implement a particular instructional program, course ordevice, or to change to an existing one, rests upon identifying the costsof all the alternatives, such as:-  The cost of research and development.-  All personnel costs in development.-  Development and delivery costs of all versions of equipment.-  The cost of running the implementation for the life of the systemincluding operation and maintenance.SummaryWhen the conventional instructional system and a technology-enhancedsystem demonstrate the same effectiveness, the one that costs the lessmight be preferred.Continued on next pageAFH 36-2235, Volume  2  2 SEPTEMBER 200223ConclusionSubstantial demonstrated differences in instructional effectiveness mustbe considered before applying alternative programs, courses, or devices.24AFH 36-2235, Volume 2   2 SEPTEMBER 2002Structuring and Sequencing InstructionImportant findingStudents learn as well from structured materials and self-study as fromconventional classroom procedures.  It works as well as conventionalmethods for teaching knowledge.How to structureStructuring materials require you to do as follows:-  Divide instructional materials into learnable segments.-  Determine their presentation order.-  Require students to pass tests to demonstrate comprehension beforeallowing them to progress to new instruction.StructuringadvantagesStructured instructional materials provide:-  Students an opportunity for self-paced study.-  Considerable saving of training time.-  Distribution to remote locations as alternatives to lectures.SequencingInstructional sequencing is designed to require an active response fromstudents before new information is presented.SequencingadvantagesSome of the advantages of sequencing to consider:-  Students get immediate feedback.-  Students may omit material they already know.-  Students may identify segments where errors require further study.-  Students may receive instruction on various media such ascomputers, workbooks, or lectures.Structuring examples Many Computer-Aided Instruction (CAI) programs are examples ofstructuring instruction; others use simulation or gaming techniques.AFH 36-2235, Volume  2  2 SEPTEMBER 200225Self Paced InstructionImportant findingStudents who progress through the materials at their own rate completethe materials in about one-third less time than do students who attendconventional courses.Student attitudesStudent preferences and attitudes in comparing self-paced withconventional instruction:-  Students prefer having an instructor present the instruction.-  Students prefer sitting in a classroom with a human being who canlisten and respond rather than sitting in a media carrel.-  Students have similar attitudes toward the content in group or self-paced.26AFH 36-2235, Volume 2   2 SEPTEMBER 2002Interactive CoursewareImportant findingStudents learn the same content as well or better from InteractiveCourseware (ICW) as in the regular classroom.ICW advantagesAdvantages of computer-based instruction are:-  Students complete lessons faster.-  Course materials can be widely distributed and given at any time.Research on ICWeffectivenessFigure 2, taken from Orlansky and String (1979), provides a graphicsummary of a review of 40 research studies comparing the effectivenessof interactive courseware and standard training in the Air Force, Army,and Navy.Figure 2.

The evidence from the 40 researchstudies verifies the suitability of interactive courseware in the military.ICW comparedA review of nearly 200 studies comparing ICW with conventionalelementary, secondary, and college instruction found:- - - - ICW raised student achievement significantly.ICW students gained a better appreciation of technology.ICW led to improvement in student attitudes toward schools andteaching.ICW helped teachers manage instructional time.Reasons for ICWeffectivenessEffectiveness and efficiency gains do not result simply from usinginteractive courseware in the instruction.  They result from applying asystems approach to the course design and allowing students to progressat their own learning rates.  Military courses normally requireinstructional systems development for all courses and so the gains fromICW would be primarily from timesavings and not improved studentperformance.Careful planningrequiredCareful planning is necessary before deciding to use ICW.  In eachsituation, cost-effectiveness is a critical issue.  True ICW is an excellentmethod of instruction but in some cases time and resources are notavailable to develop a course using these media.28AFH 36-2235, Volume 2   2 SEPTEMBER 2002Video TechnologiesImportant findingVideo technologies can simulate world events, equipment, or tasks anddeliver interactive instruction in formal schools and remote worksites,referred to as Interactive Video Disk Instruction (IVD).TelecommunicationsadvantagesTelecommunications technologies have the potential for deliveringinstruction to learners at formal schools and remote sites. Advantagesare:-  Blends of technologies can provide learning experiences, whichemphasize interaction and individualized learning.-  Linked video and computer technologies can provide interactivetraining incorporating such important variables as immediatefeedback, individualized pacing, and almost unlimited combinationsof text, audio, graphics, and full- motion video.-  Multiple branching, immediate feedback, and individualizedinteraction are other inherent features.IVD advantagesIVD can enhance the effectiveness of computer-based instruction.  IVDadvantages are:-  Full motion video better supports learning objectives requiringobservation of people or machines in motion.-  Students completing IVD score considerably higher than students intraditional courses.-  Students in self-paced IVD learn the same or more in less time thanin lecture-based presentations.Needs assessmentIVD requires needs assessment and cost-effectiveness analyses beperformed before implementation.AFH 36-2235, Volume  2  2 SEPTEMBER 200229SimulatorsImportant findingSimulators enable learners to acquire the knowledge they need to operateand repair devices.  Learners can practice at speeds not constrained byreal time at a fraction of training cost over using actual equipment.Simulators also decrease the risk of personal harm or damage to actualequipment.Simulator definitionSimulators may be devices that physically resemble actual equipment (amock-up or part-task trainer) or a type of computer-based training(CBT) in which computer images or video are used to represent theequipment.SimulatoradvantagesSimulators offer many training advantages:-  They are cheaper to practice on than actual equipment.-  They are often easier to understand than the actual equipmentbecause they can depict normally invisible functions and events suchas electron flows.-  They can determine how much practice the student needs and canisolate and repeat the difficult segments of a task.-  They can present events at speeds that are much faster than real time.-  They present the effect of manipulations so they can be seen quickly.-  They provide the opportunity to accomplish additional practicequickly.-  They can incorporate important training variables such as detailedperformance evaluation and feedback.30AFH 36-2235, Volume 2   2 SEPTEMBER 2002Development and Use of SimulatorsImportant findingDesign, development, and use of simulators require careful planning andspecial skills.Design developmentfactorsThe following factors are important to the design and development ofsimulation devices:-  Design decisions must be related to the cognitive processes requiredto learn the task rather than focusing on particular hardware or themedium.-  An effective simulator should isolate relevant cues while studentslearn to ignore irrelevant information.-  A simulator’s effectiveness is more a function of the instructionalmethods used to support learning.-  A simulator’s physical similarity to the device it represents does notdetermine its effectiveness.-  Tryouts with typical students are important to validate the design.Analysis requiredRemember that needs assessment and cost-effectiveness analyses must beaccomplished before acquiring this medium!AFH 36-2235, Volume  2  2 SEPTEMBER 200231Distributed Learning and Tele-trainingImportant findingStudents away from formal schools can interact with instructors throughmodern communications technology such as networked computers withor without television.Electronic networkadvantagesThrough instructional electronics networks, students alone or in smallgroups, can learn skills and knowledge where they will use them:-  Telephone computer networks control audio or electronic exchangesbetween students and instructors.  Satellite links, cable television, orcassettes deliver video if needed.-  Participants work on problems particular to their own situation whentheir work schedule allows.-  Variations are possible.  Participants can delay the interactions bysaving questions, answers and comments until time is available toaddress them.Tele-TrainingadvantagesTeletraining involving one-way video with two-way audio links isperhaps the best compromise between cost and information quality.  Theadvantages are:-  This provides full presentation of visual information and allowsstudents to ask questions or make comments at any time.-  Compressed two-way video is also becoming more economicallyfeasible.-  The advent of large-scale digital networks and satellite links has madevideo teleconferencing more commonplace.Tele-TrainingdeterrentsDeterrents to the use of teletraining are the significant preparation time,equipment costs, and relatively complex logistics required.Continued on next page32Benefits ofteletrainingAFH 36-2235, Volume 2   2 SEPTEMBER 2002The following are benefits of teletraining:-  Enables new students to observe experienced specialists.-  Reaches learners where and when the training is needed.-  Shifts more responsibility for acquiring the skill from the trainer tothe student.-  Saves travel cost by not requiring time away from job.Micro-ComputeradvantageMicrocomputers can also serve as terminals to remote data banks andnetwork members.  Through telephone connections and a centralizedmessage workspace, learners can ask questions or propose solutions toother members sharing the network.  This provides an inexpensive sourcefor high quality ICW lessons, desktop simulators or simulations.AFH 36-2235, Volume  2  2 SEPTEMBER 200233Adopting ChangeImportant findingEducation and training managers and developers can affect the rate atwhich the schools and instructors adopt newly developed instructionalmaterials and programs.Adopting strategiesPoints on adopting strategies:-  Training commands and schools should consider the strategies usedto encourage the potential users to adopt the new materials.-  One way of overcoming the "not invented here" attitude is to involveall potential users in the analysis and design phases of innovativecourses.34AFH 36-2235, Volume 2   2 SEPTEMBER 2002Managing ChangeImportant findingUsing an effective person as an agent to manage change is a criticalfactor in its spread.Role of change agent The agent studies the potential adopting organization and systematicallyshows that the innovation:-  Has obvious advantages over the existing process, materials, orequipment.Is compatible with the existing system.Is supported by significant research and/or evaluations.Is a rational sequence for its adoption and application.- - - -  Addresses an identified need of the potential user.-  Will be used for a long time.-  Can be adopted by the staff with minimum training.Managing changeTo properly manage change, the manager must concentrate on thefollowing related to:-  The potential users and their needs rather than the material or theinnovation.-  The situation as well as the potential user.-  The need to tailor the innovation to the user’s needs.-  The need to explain the innovation to the potential users.AFH 36-2235, Volume  2  2 SEPTEMBER 200235Conclusion to Techniques for Instructional ManagersManager shouldaccomplishAfter reviewing this Section, regarding important techniques for theinstructional manager, you should now be able to accomplish thefollowing:-  Become an assertive instructional leader by putting instructionalexcellence first.-  Focus programs on instructional goals and protect them fromirrelevant demands.-  Demand high quality training from staff, instructors, and students.-  Develop and monitor in-service staff training.-  Encourage consensus on values and goals.-  Establish a system for evaluation and monitor it systematically.-  Bring instructional technology and good practices to bear oninstruction.-  Promote a positive climate and overall atmosphere.-  Plan and coordinate long-range changes in education/training toincrease effectiveness and efficiency.-  Analyze and plan for use of technology to increase productivity.-  Consult with education and training specialists about respectivepolicy and practices.Instructor roleIn the next section we will turn our attention to the most influentialperson in the eyes of the student, the instructor.36AFH 36-2235, Volume 2   2 SEPTEMBER 2002Section BTechniques for InstructorsWhere to read aboutitThe following topical index is provided as a quick reference to thissection.TopicStudent FeedbackStudent ActivitiesClassroom LeadershipLearning StrategiesTesting Student ProgressProviding Students FeedbackManaging Active Learning TimeCooperative LearningPeer TeachingEffective Instructor PresentationsPracticing ApplicationsMental ModelsMotivating StudentsStudent Controlled LearningOut-of-Class AssignmentsConclusion to Techniques for InstructorsPage37383940434546474850525354565758AFH 36-2235, Volume  2  2 SEPTEMBER 200237Student FeedbackImportant findingInstructors can improve their performance through careful analysis ofstudent feedback.Benefits of studentratingsWhen schools require students to rate instructors, they expect instructorsto use the ratings for improving instructional techniques.  Evaluationstudies show that feedback from student ratings improves instructorperformance:-  Research on college teaching revealed that instructors who receivedfeedback from mid-semester ratings received substantially higher end-of-course ratings than instructors who were rated at the end of thesemester did.-  Ratings improve more when instructors discuss the mid- semester- with consultants or received help in reacting to them.Instructors and managers can use ratings during a course to modifyand improve teaching with the same groups.Feedback timingAs with all feedback, it is timing and content which influence itseffectiveness.  Other instructors or education and training specialists canhelp individual instructors improve their teaching through studentfeedback.38AFH 36-2235, Volume 2   2 SEPTEMBER 2002Student ActivitiesImportant findingStudent activities during learning are more important in determining whatis learned than the instructor’s presentation.Planning activelearningInstructors aid student achievement by getting students to engage inactivities that are likely to result in learning:-  Effective instructors not only present facts, ideas, or information butalso get students actively involved in appropriate learning activities toattain desired outcomes.-  Learning is an active process, and instructors should develop as manylearning strategies as possible to help students achieve the objectives.Prior knowledgeDuring the learning processes, instructors should consider students’ priorknowledge.  Students’ understanding of new information depends on howwell they relate it to their prior knowledge:-  Students often begin learning with substantial misconceptions aboutthe material they are studying and its intended use.-  Even students who get high grades have these misconceptions.-  Students make systematic errors based on misconceptions anderroneous procedures from prior knowledge.Instructional intentStudents should never begin instruction without understanding its intent:- - Instructors need to fully explain the instructional intent (courseobjectives) and its relationship to the knowledge, skills, and attitudesthe students already possess.Instructor must understand how current and prior knowledgedetermines what the students will learn from new material thatconflicts with their existing beliefs.-  Students should be asked to reveal their misconceptions so that theinstructor can address them.AFH 36-2235, Volume  2  2 SEPTEMBER 200239Classroom LeadershipImportant findingEffective instructor classroom leadership promotes effective studentlearning.Instructor leadershipInstructors lead students to learn by focusing on the following:-  Presenting well-conceived learning objectives.-  Conducting regular and comprehensive evaluations of studentlearning.-  Having high expectations of all students.-  Providing a purposeful learning environment.-  Concerning themselves with student performance.Diversity of opinionInstructors should encourage diversity of opinion by:-  Pointing out relationships between various opinions and ideas.-  Stressing the variety of potential solutions to a problem.-  Protecting minority opinions.-  Keeping disagreement under control.Peer feedbackPeer-feedback improves instructional effectiveness.  Instructors canobserve each others’ classroom procedures and provide constructivefeedback.Objective gradesStudents' grades should be based on objective attainment.  Grades shouldnot be used to correct disciplinary problems.  Disciplinary problems arereduced when students actively participate in learning.Instructor's roleInstructors must  accomplish the following:-  Help students perceive education and training as relevant andinteresting.-  Use techniques to reinforce good behavior.-  Seek friendly relationships.-  Encourage students to cooperate with other students and staff.40AFH 36-2235, Volume 2   2 SEPTEMBER 2002Learning StrategiesImportant findingStudy skills and strategies can influence what and how students learn.Students can learn effective study strategies.Learning strategiesStudy or learning strategies may affect learner motivation or the way theyselect, acquire, organize, or integrate new knowledge.  An example ofthese strategies would be:-  Learners may coach themselves to reduce anxiety.-  Learners may use imaging to relate vocabulary words and meanings.-  Learners may summarize and take notes to memorize writtenmaterial.Better students uselearning strategiesAbove average students use learning strategies to acquire, organize, orintegrate new knowledge.  Students may use imaging to relatevocabulary words and meanings, or summarize and take notes tomemorize written material.Average studentsinfrequently useAverage and below average students use effective study strategiesinfrequently.  They need to be taught how to use these strategies. Oncethey have learned the strategies, all students can study and learn moreefficiently.  They must be encouraged to do so.Factors in studentstudyStudents can monitor and adjust the way they study based on:-  Whether they understand difficult material.-  How much time they have for studying.-  How much they know about the material.-  The standards they must meet.Continued on next pageAFH 36-2235, Volume  2  2 SEPTEMBER 200241Instructor role forimproving studyskillsInstructors’ can help improve study skills by:-  Adjusting students’ study methods according to content difficulty,time allowed for studying, familiarity with content, and standardsrequired.-  Spreading study sessions on a topic over available time so studentsdo not work continuously on a single topic.-  Using study strategies appropriate for learning a task.-  Use rehearsal and self-testing to memorize ordered lists, take notesthat paraphrase a lecture, organize information in text by identifyingmain ideas and relating to current knowledge.-  Allowing students to assess their progress and modify the strategiesas needed.Effect of trainingTraining of techniques for learning from text materials has a substantialeffect on test performance covering the content studied.An example oftraining students tolearn textIn the following example, students were taught:-  How to make a network map of the information in a text.-  How to make a spatial representation of the information.-  How to paraphrase.-  How to draw pictorial representations of ideas and concepts.Four different measures were used to examine the effect of the training.Figure 3, taken from Montague and Knirk, shows that trained studentssubstantially outperformed untrained ones on essay and short-answertests.  The histogram bars show how much the scores of the trainedstudents exceeded those of untrained students.On a “cloze” test every nth word in the material is deleted, and thestudent tries to fill in the correct word from memory.  Trained studentsalso showed superior performance on that type of test.  On a multiple-choice test trained students’ superiority was slight.  This type of test isnot as useful a test for examining student learning and understanding.42AFH 36-2235, Volume 2   2 SEPTEMBER 2002Figure 3.

Instructors and managers learn aboutstrengths and weaknesses in student learning and the instruction.Types of testsStudents are tested to determine what they know and what they need tolearn. Various types of tests can be used including observing laboratoryexercise performance, giving oral quizzes and test, assigning homework,asking questions in the classroom, and giving comprehensiveperformance tests.Advantages ofstudent assessmentThe following are advantages of student assessment:-  Student errors on tests and in class alert instructors to learningproblems that need to be corrected.-  Student motivation and achievement improve when instructorsprovide prompt feedback on their performance and assignments.-  Frequently tested students outperform less tested ones in theclassroom.Knowledge testsStudents generally take either knowledge or performance tests.Knowledge tests help instructors find out if the students have learnedinformation important for safety and knowledge important forperformance.Performance testsPerformance tests enable instructors to determine student competenceand identify student and instructor problems.  The instructors’ biggestconcern with testing is to identify what the students do not know.Continued on next page44AFH 36-2235, Volume 2   2 SEPTEMBER 2002Job-like testsIn technical training, assessment should be as job-like as possible.  Thefollowing should be applied:-  Emphasizing hands on performance tests.-  Limiting pencil and paper tests to safety and knowledge, critical forjob performance.-  Testing with open-book where students use manuals and otherreferences normally available on the job.PerformancedifficultiesPerformance difficulties often indicate gaps in student knowledge.Student explanations of their actions or answers to questions can helpinstructors identify knowledge gaps.AFH 36-2235, Volume  2  2 SEPTEMBER 200245Providing Students FeedbackImportant findingStudents who receive constructive feedback about the accuracy andadequacy of their performance become more interested in the class andlearn more.Immediate feedback Giving immediate, constructive student feedback is an effective way forinstructors to aid student learning.Student feedbackcharacteristicsNo one method is best for providing student feedback.  Feedback shouldhave the following characteristics:-  The feedback should be prompt and provide useful information.-  Feedback emphasizing the method used to get the correct answerreinforces the solution.Features ofinstructor feedbackInstructor feedback should have the following features:- - - - Instructors should give nonspecific praise and criticism infrequently.It should be based on the quality of student performance.Instructors should explain correct or incorrect performance.  This isbetter than to give only the correct answer or to judge the studentperformance.Instructors’ feedback should routinely tell students when they areincorrect.  They should focus on the content and explain how toreach the correct answer.Instructors’ critical feedback, written or spoken, should be given inprivate and not in front of the class.Benefits of timelyfeedbackConstructive, timely feedback, helps students develop self-esteem as wellas improve performance:-  Students who believe they can succeed are usually more successfulthan those who are less sure of their ability.-  Students who believe they can succeed are more active learners,work independently, cooperate with other students, and achievemore.46AFH 36-2235, Volume 2   2 SEPTEMBER 2002Managing Active Learning TimeImportant findingStudents who are actively engaged in learning learn more than thosepassively involved.Active involvementThe time allocated for learning differs from the time students are“actually engaged” in learning. This difference becomes important inhands-on training, whereby the lack of available equipment sometimescauses students to spend time observing others.Passive exposurePassive exposure to laboratory does not mean students are activelyengaged in learning.  Instructors should use techniques to engage allstudents in learning.Effective instructorsEffective instructors determine learning time accurately and usetechniques that increase the time students spend on learning activities.The following techniques are helpful:- - - Instructors minimize time for breaks and interruption of individualstudents.  Students can help instructors analyze their classroom byidentifying distracting events and procedures that could be changed.Instructors can increase students' attention to learning and increaselearning time and achievement.  Questions can focus on material orproblems in texts or manuals.Instructors who summarize important information prepare studentsfor studying.-  Students who are easily distracted may profit from out-of-classassignments that focus on overcoming the distractions and processingrelevant content.-  Students who receive explicit feedback about their performance learnwhat is required of them and how to correct their actions.ConclusionInstructors who supplement a well-planned training program with theselearning activities can achieve three major goals:-  They can capture the students' attention.-  They can make the best use of available learning time.-  They can encourage academic achievement.AFH 36-2235, Volume  2  2 SEPTEMBER 200247Cooperative LearningImportant findingCooperating with other students during learning often improves learning.Cooperative learningadvantagesSome advantages of cooperative learning are:-  Organizing students into small study groups improves performanceon achievement tests.-  Arranging students into small groups promotes positive attitudestoward each other and learning.-  Organizing students into groups of two or three assist "team" activityand crew training for the Air Force.Single studentdominationeliminatedIt is important that one student does not limit opportunities for learningby dominating others.  This can be achieved by testing them separately orby instituting other procedures that ensure that each student spends anappropriate amount of time actively learning.Cooperation versuscompetitionStudents tend to avoid activities that they believe will result in failure.  Acompetitive situation arouses the need to either achieve success or avoidfailure.  Encouraging cooperation, rather than competition, amongstudents promotes effective achievement and productivity.Identifying poorperformanceInstructors should demonstrate a cooperative spirit by not singling outpoor performers.  Self-esteem and ego are "on the line" when studentsare asked to perform in front of classmates. Bad experiences intraditional education, feelings about authority, and the preoccupationwith events outside the classroom all affect experiences in class.  Singlingout poor performers leads to negative attitudes toward the instructor andthe students.ConclusionInstructors can increase student learning by promoting cooperation ratherthan competition among the students. Students competing for grades orother extrinsic goals focus on beating other students rather than onunderstanding the course material and learning how to work as a teammember.48AFH 36-2235, Volume 2   2 SEPTEMBER 2002Peer TeachingImportant findingStudents who receive instruction from peer teachers receive highergrades and develop positive attitudes toward training.Advantages of peerinstructionPeer instruction provides the following advantages:-  Peer interaction improves students’ academic performances and- attitudes.Instructors can supplement regular classroom teaching with peerteaching.-  Peer instruction helps slower students succeed.-  Peer teachers benefit from preparing and giving lessons they prepareand present.Peer teachingPeer teaching can take a variety of forms as:- Instructor assistants leading discussion groups, seminars, or tutorialgroups.-  Senior students assisting new students (see the proctor model atFigure 4).-  Student-led learning groups which have no instructors.Raises test scoresStudent coaching usually raises test scores (see Figure 4).  The effectsare greatest in long, cognitive and extensive drill-and-practice courses.Short test-taking oriented courses show the least improvement as a resultof coaching methods.Effectiveness of peerinstructionThe graph at Figure 4, taken from Montague and Knirk (1993), is basedon actual student performance.  It demonstrates the relationship betweenpeer teaching (student coaching) and reduction in student attrition.AFH 36-2235, Volume  2  2 SEPTEMBER 200249Effectiveness of peerinstruction(Continued)Figure 3.  Effectiveness of Peer Teaching.ConclusionStudents bring a lot of invaluable life experiences into the classroom,which should be acknowledged and used.  Students can learn muchthrough interacting with respected peers.50AFH 36-2235, Volume 2   2 SEPTEMBER 2002Effective Instructor PresentationsImportant findingStudents learn best when their instructors inspire them to take an activerole in their learning.Good instructorsGood instructors are not only subject matter experts in what they teachbut know how to teach.  They are prepared to answer student questionsand stimulate student interaction.Factors for effectivepresentationsFor effective presentations, instructors should keep the followingconcepts in mind:-  Present the material in a logical structure which can help studentslearn and remember.  Students can remember only a small amount ofmaterial presented orally or visually.-  Present no more than two or three main ideas in a 15-minutesegment.-  Use techniques to stimulate students to assume an active role inunderstanding what is taught.-  Present summaries to reemphasize main ideas, illustrations, tables,and charts.-  Use lesson enhancements that foster retention. Students are likely toremember the illustration used to teach a concept or practice.QuestioningatmosphereInstructors who maintain a questioning atmosphere force students tothink and solve problems.Ways to stimulatelearningInstructors can use the following techniques to stimulate learning:-  Ask students to summarize lessons.-  Challenge students by providing incorrect information to determine ifthey can provide the correct information.-  Divide students into small groups for discussions.-  Ask questions randomly during lectures.-  Relate directly to relevant "war stories" or anecdotes and explaintheir relevance clearly.Continued on next pageAFH 36-2235, Volume  2  2 SEPTEMBER 200251Demonstrate taskstepsStudents learn best when instructors demonstrate steps to accomplish atask.  Instructors should systematically demonstrate tasks, explaining thepurpose and result of each activity.  This is particularly effective inteaching basic skills, and in helping experienced students master complexmaterials.52AFH 36-2235, Volume 2   2 SEPTEMBER 2002Practicing ApplicationsImportant findingPractice promotes learning of new skills.Lack of practiceMost education and training programs involve too much in the way oftalking, presenting, and demonstrating on the part of the instructor.Procedural tasksWith procedural tasks, listening and watching are not good enough if youhave the option of doing.  Remember that doing requires some initiallevel of learning.Key pointsThe following key points contribute to successful practice:-  Students learn best by doing and should have opportunities topractice.-  Students should practice a variety of tasks representative of the job.- -  Explicit feedback helps students identify and correct performanceInstructors should emphasize key points to increase retention.difficulties.Amount of practiceThe amount of practice required to correctly perform a task usuallyincreases with task complexity.  In very complex tasks, small segments ofa task should be practiced before the entire task.  Removing a jet engineis a complex task, which might require practice on individual enginecomponents (task activities) before the engine is actually removed.AppropriatetechniquesUsing the wrong learning strategy inhibits learning during practice.Instructors should always use practice techniques appropriate for eachtask.  In seemingly simple tasks such as memorizing strings of digits,students can practice for hours without improving their performanceunless a proper learning strategy is used.  Grouping or coding schemesmay be the best way to learn strings of digits.AFH 36-2235, Volume  2  2 SEPTEMBER 200253Mental ModelsImportant findingMental models promote understanding of concepts.Mental modeldefinitionLearning involves the development of qualitative conceptual structuresthat are called "mental models.”  A person uses mental models tounderstand, explain, and predict things about the world.  Mental modelsallow people to describe a system's structure, explain its present state,and make predictions about future states.Mental modelsevolveMental models evolve naturally through the interaction of the learner andparticular environments.  Methods can be devised to promote theirdevelopment as follows:-  One way is representing the functionality of the work environmentand the devices and equipment in it. Providing external guidance ordirections allows the buildup of experience.  This coupled withcognitive information will guide performance.-  An accurate mental model develops from the way events flow on-the-job, and how devices function and can malfunction.  This serves asthe scheme to guide personal action when new problems areencountered.-  Students should describe in detail the steps they are using inperforming a task.  This will help identify errors. Student competencedevelops faster and transfers readily to the work environment withthis procedure.ExampleAs an example, take the task of training the students to solve problems inelectric circuits, thermodynamics, or mechanics.  By guiding studentsthrough the steps, explaining why they are taken, and then havingstudents describe the factors and their interactions as they solvesubsequent problems, they learn rapidly and accurately.  Instructors cancheck the accuracy of a student's initial representation of all facets of theproblem and provide basic correct solutions.ConclusionBy concentrating on accurate initial description of the problem, studentslearn to internalize the procedures as part of their mental model, whichthey use habitually in approaching problems later on.54AFH 36-2235, Volume 2   2 SEPTEMBER 2002Motivating StudentsImportant findingLearning improves when students set their own goals and determine howto achieve them.Student controlledlearningStudents who believe they control their own learning experience, believethey can handle most training challenges.  However, not all students cantake charge of their own learning without encouragement and help.Student set goalsStudents can learn to set daily goals, monitor progress toward thesegoals, and chart progress to provide reinforcement. Instructors shouldalways check students’ progress and provide positive verbalencouragement and reinforcement.Focus oncompetenceExtrinsic rewards (grades, etc.) may not motivate students as much asgoals and rewards based on direct involvement with the ongoingeducation and training.  Instructors should focus attention on the longterm competence rather than extrinsic rewards.  The followingtechniques are useful in promoting this focus:-  Provide feedback that informs.-  Encourage persistence in learning.-  Point out instructional relevance.Rewarding learningeffortInstructors frequently reward learner effort so that the learners mayconcentrate on working hard and fast rather than on the quality of theirwork.Continued on next pageAFH 36-2235, Volume  2  2 SEPTEMBER 200255Instructors shouldemphasizeInstructors should examine their reward system and place more emphasison the following to encourage effort and performance:- Instructors should explain, when effort is rewarded, the extent towhich the reward is for their effort, so that students do not confusean effort award for quality performance.-  Students generally consider the quality of their work more when- - performance is emphasized.Instructors should never tell students who are failing that the failureis only because of lack of ability.  Students who feel they do not havethe ability to learn may develop a pattern of hopelessness and stoptrying.Instructors should help students overcome training obstacles anddevote effort to learning if there is any chance the individuals cansucceed.ConclusionInstructors should focus on motivating their students, and on relevantlearning tasks.  Less capable students should be rewarded for progress;high achievers should always be challenged according to their abilities.56AFH 36-2235, Volume 2   2 SEPTEMBER 2002Student Controlled LearningImportant findingStudents’ perceptions of who controls key events in learning significantlyaffects their academic achievement.Student perceptionsStudents generally attribute learning success to a combination of ability,effort, and luck.  Students believe if they significantly control learning,they can also organize their environment for maximum success; that isthey can "make their own luck."Student perceptionsof successThe following points represent student perceptions about success andfailure:-  Civilian schools have repeatedly demonstrated that in teaching slowerstudents, the students think that other individuals cause theirsuccesses and failures.-  Successful students are more likely to recognize their responsibilityfor achievement.-  Students’ perceptions about who caused their successes and failuresdepend on situational factors.  Certainly instructors can change theseperceptions.-  Feedback on performance quality and how to improve it can teachslower students to recognize that they are responsible for theirlearning and performance.AFH 36-2235, Volume  2  2 SEPTEMBER 200257Out-of-Class AssignmentsImportant findingStudents’ performances improve significantly when instructors regularlygive out-of-class assignments, ensure they are completed, and provideexplicit feedback.Students learn moreStudents in courses requiring out-of-class assignments learn more thanstudents in courses without such assignments.Relevant out-of-classassignmentsThe time students spend on relevant out-of-class assignments benefitsthem as much as in-class learning time.  Instructors should always gradeassignments to inform students of their performance.Benefits from out-of-class assignmentsThe following are benefits from out-of-class assignments:- Instructors can use out-of-class assignments to increase practice, atechnique especially helpful for low achievers.-  Low achievers doing out-of-class assignments often obtain grades ashigh as students do with greater ability that do not do extraassignments.-  Out-of-class assignments boost student achievement throughincreasing total study time.-  Out-of-class assignments can be helpful for all students, butespecially for slower students.SummaryStudents are more willing to do assignments they consider useful.Instructors should give the same care in preparing out-of-classassignments as classroom instruction.ConclusionOut-of-class assignments must be an integral part of instruction.Evaluate them, and count them as part of the course requirements.58AFH 36-2235, Volume 2   2 SEPTEMBER 2002Conclusion to Techniques for InstructorsExcellent techniquesare agelessAfter looking at what civilian and military research found in the role ofthe instructor, one can see that some excellent techniques are ageless.We have to remind ourselves that what worked in the past can still worktoday.What motivatedinstructors doWe learned in this section that a motivated instructor would help thestudent in the following ways:Theoretical-  Bring good practices to bear on education and training.-  Focus classroom activities on learning.-  Emphasize student learning and achievement.-  Provide well-structured presentations and classroom activities.-  Arrange many and varied learning activities.-  Test and question students to evaluate their learning progress andmaintain motivation to learn.Hands On-  Monitor students studying and adjust their activities to maximizetheir effort and progress.-  Give corrective feedback regularly.-  Promote effective use of instructional time.  Learn and use teachingtechniques that enhance student learning.-  Create a job-like instructional situation.-  Emphasize hands-on, job-like performance tests.-  Provide students with opportunities for individualized work.-  Design out-of-class assignments to increase student achievement.Caring aboutstudentsMost of all, right up front, you must care about your students and letthem know you are excited about teaching them.  If the students aren’tconvinced you care, all areas of discussion so far will not matter!Manager, instructor,specialist arerequiredThe manager and instructor are clearly important elements to ensure thestudent learns what is important, and the student feels good about whatis learned.  The specialist is the third element needed for the successfuldelivery of education and training.Continued on next pageAFH 36-2235, Volume  2  2 SEPTEMBER 200259Specialist roleSpecialists provide advice and assistance to managers and instructors.They assist with evaluation, course materials design and development.The instructor and specialist may be the same person.  Economic realitiesmake this an increasing probability.  The next section will focus on whatresearch contributes to the performance of the specialist.60AFH 36-2235, Volume 2   2 SEPTEMBER 2002Section CTechniques for Instructional SpecialistsWhere to read aboutitThe following topical index is provided as a quick reference to thissection.TopicSystematic Instructional DesignInstructional ObjectivesText EnhancementReading Grade LevelsBuilding on Existing KnowledgeUsing ExamplesMotivating StudentsDesigning Effective IllustrationsFormative and Summative EvaluationEffective SimulationEffective TestingInstructional Objectives and TestsInstructional Time DistributionPromoting Student CooperationMemory AidsConclusionPage61636466676870727475767879808285AFH 36-2235, Volume  2  2 SEPTEMBER 200261Systematic Instructional DesignImportant findingSystematic training design models provide methodologies for planning,analyzing, designing, developing, implementing, and managinginstruction and are important for limiting content to what is clearlyneeded.System approachsimilaritiesSystem approaches to instructional design all require the same generalsteps or phases necessary to produce instruction to support the intendedlearning by students.Positivecharacteristics ofsystem approachesSystem approaches share these positive characteristics:-  These system models (refer to AFMAN 36-2234) make sure thatevery piece of instruction has recognizable elements and is tied to ananalysis of needs and tasks to be learned.-  They assist the management of training development by: makingeducation and training congruent with job-tasks without irrelevantcontent, evaluating effectiveness and revising inadequate materials,making media development more efficient, promoting efficient use oftime, and allowing for structured resource management and planning.Limited training insystems approachQuality of training programs applying systems approach models usuallydepends on the knowledge and skills of the personnel using theprocedures.  Most Air Force instructors receive only brief training in theuse of these procedures.InsufficientunderstandingInsufficient understanding of how learning occurs prevents thedevelopment of simple, yet general and useful, theories of how to make itoccur.  Until this process is better understood, clear and simpleprescriptions for devising instruction will not be available for them tofollow.Continued on next pageAir Force solutionThe Air Force is currently attempting to fix this problem of insufficientunderstanding of how learning occurs by creating “How To” volumes onapplying Instructional Systems Development (ISD) to Acquisition,Aircrew Training, Technical Training, Education, and Application toUnit Training (AFH 36-2235, Vols. 3, and 8 through 11).62AFH 36-2235, Volume 2   2 SEPTEMBER 2002Instructionalmaterials must betestedBecause of the different levels of expertise involved in developinginstruction, empirical tryouts of the instructional materials and systemwith students is very important.Findings in thisVolume Are TestedMany of the research findings in this volume provide useful informationfor designing instruction.  Developers need to become aware of thesetried-out results and learn how to incorporate them into the instructionthey design and develop.Navy InstructionalQuality InventoryThe Navy, as the Air Force, has developed a tool for reviewingobjectives and checking their congruency with associated training andtest items called the Instructional Quality Inventory (IQI).  When appliedto existing programs, or during the development of new courses, this IQItool focuses instructional developers on the objectives and courserequirements during the development of instructional materials and testitems.AFH 36-2235, Volume  2  2 SEPTEMBER 200263Instructional ObjectivesImportant findingObjectives that directly reflect education/training requirements are easiestto test.  Measurable, observable education/training objectives ensureconsistency among job tasks, course content, and test items.  Wheneducation/training include objectives, student confidence improves andanxiety decreases.Objectives useful forall contentObjectives may be easier to write for concrete procedures rather than formore academic content areas such as history.  There is no evidence tosuggest that objectives are more useful for one content area than another.Objectives havethree elementsExpanding the task statements into objectives requires the following:-  Clarifying the behaviors.- Identifying the relevant conditions under which the behaviors are tobe displayed.-  Specifying standards used to determine adequate performance.Test development is facilitated when objectives contain the above threeelements.64AFH 36-2235, Volume 2   2 SEPTEMBER 2002Text EnhancementImportant findingText enhancement through effective introduction, summaries, examples,and diagrams aids student comprehension.Importance of textMuch education and training is accomplished through writtendescriptions.  Texts are prepared to serve as a basis for student learningby providing facts, examples, and explanations.StudentunderstandingTo learn, students must understand the materials and how they can applythe information.Reasons for lack ofunderstandingDescriptions, instructions, and explanations are often difficult tounderstand because of terminology, inadequate connections to studentknowledge, or a “topic-orientation” that tells all about a subject, but not“what a person does” or “how to do it.”Performanceoriented writingWriting should be performance oriented rather than topic oriented.Topic oriented writing looks like reference material aimed at a general,unspecified audience, telling all about a subject and not how to apply theinformation.Benefits ofperformanceoriented writingPerformance oriented writing focuses on specific users; describes theirroles, tasks, and responsibilities; and gives them the information theyneed about how to perform.  The advantage of performance oriented textis that readers do not have to infer and conceptualize what to do; it isstated explicitly.AFH 36-2235, Volume  2  2 SEPTEMBER 200265Writing techniquesto improve studentcomprehensionTechniques for improving text comprehension include:-  Providing pre-presentation summaries outlining learning- requirements.Inserting pictures showing spatial relationships, object form, orinternal structures.-  Using concrete examples clarifying abstract ideas or depicting howprinciples work.-  Using methods that put demands on the student in reading and“processing” the text.-  Asking questions inserted before or after text segments to identifyimportant information, or make desired inferences.-  Asking students to construct a diagram or “map” depicting therelationship of ideas in text to aid comprehension and rememberingthe information.66AFH 36-2235, Volume 2   2 SEPTEMBER 2002Reading Grade LevelsImportant findingReading grade level scores help in determining how well studentsunderstand instructional materials.Readability predictsrecallReadability formulas predict how well personnel of varying readingability can recall text they have read or heard.Limitations ofreadabilityReadability is of limited usefulness for predicting comprehension ofinstruction.  It is limited because it does not:-  Provide precise estimates of difficulty.-  Estimate the difficulty of non-text materials such as tables and figuresthat make up much of the instruction in technical training courses.-  Take into account how the materials will be used-- whether they arestudied and learned or read while performing.-  Take into account students’ background knowledge in the area andrelated areas.  Students with a lot of background knowledge canattain high comprehension while having reading ability several gradelevels lower.Issues other thanreadabilityIssues other than readability should be considered in developinginstruction.  Performance oriented text is recommended in manuals overtopic orientation.  Topic oriented text tells the reader everything onewants to know about the topic, but it does not tell what actions are to beperformed.  A reader must infer what to do.  Surprisingly, technicalmanuals and texts are often topic oriented.  Performance-oriented textexplicitly tells the reader what actions are expected.AFH 36-2235, Volume  2  2 SEPTEMBER 200267Building On Existing KnowledgeImportant findingStudents learn best when instruction is adapted to existing knowledge,skills, and background.Instruction shouldreflect studentexperienceStudents can learn much from the invaluable life experiences they bringinto the classroom.  Education and training materials should considerstudents’ existing knowledge and experiences.Not critical to covereverything equallyIt is not critical for educators and students to cover all topics andsubjects equally well.  Human energy and time are finite.  Trying tomaster a little of everything may sacrifice efforts to focus on crucialinformation and issues.Design instructionon entry behaviorsAs instruction is being developed, education and training specialistsshould reference target population data to determine students’ entryknowledge, skills, attitudes, and proficiencies so that instruction can bedesigned based on entry behaviors.68AFH 36-2235, Volume 2   2 SEPTEMBER 2002Using ExamplesImportant findingProviding students with good representative examples and contrastingthem with bad ones are effective instructional strategies.Collect a variety ofexamplesIt is necessary to collect a variety of examples that are not ambiguous orconfusing.Illustrate the taskIllustrate the task so that the student will understand the problem beingstudied and not acquire misconceptions.Elements of a goodexampleEach example must be complete and self-contained.  Each exampleshould contain the necessary critical features or attributes so that thestudent can observe their presence or absence.  The student should beable to construct adequate generalizations or representations of the tasksfrom a good example.Good examplecharacteristicsGood examples must possess the following characteristics:-  The form and fidelity of each example must adequately represent thecritical features of the task.-  Examples should be as divergent as possible while belonging to thetask being taught.  This will prevent the formation of misconceptions.-  Examples using extreme variations are avoided. They make examplesdifficult to understand or demand skills the students may not have.-  Easier examples should be provided early in the lesson with a gradualincrease in difficulty.Attention focusingUse attention-focusing devices to direct student attention to criticalfeatures, to confusing features, and to the absence of critical features.Students tend to respond to similar sets of stimuli in similar ways evenwhen the response may be incorrect in one situation.Continued on next pageFocus on criticaldifferencesExposing students to good examples paired with appropriate badexamples facilitates student discrimination.  Focusing on the criticaldifferences between good and bad examples, so they may be easilyidentified, will assist the student in better discrimination.AFH 36-2235, Volume  2  2 SEPTEMBER 200269ConclusionJust as students learn from their mistakes, they learn from good examplesand bad examples.70AFH 36-2235, Volume 2   2 SEPTEMBER 2002Motivating StudentsImportant findingWhen instruction gets the students’ attention, students work hard,achieve more, and enjoy learning.Four classes offactors influencingmotivationFour classes of factors influence student motivation to learn anddetermine their achievement.  Including these factors in the design anddevelopment of instruction can have beneficial effects on studentachievement.Class 1: Excitinginstruction- Instruction that is attractive and exciting is especially useful to gainstudents’ attention or interest. Instruction should include materialthat stimulates their curiosity and makes them eager to learn thematerial.Class 2: Relevantinstruction-  Students understand the relevance of instruction when objectives areexplained to them and new learning is related to their past experienceand knowledge.-  Presentations need to explain the goals of the instruction, how theknowledge is to be used, and the role students will play in the workassignment when training is finished.Class 3: Progressivesequencing-  Providing instruction that allows students to proceed through asequence of graded steps maximizes the likelihood of learning anddevelops confidence in their ability to succeed.-  Assisting students to solve learning problems early, students tend toreduce effort expended in learning when failure is repeatedlyexperienced.-  Presenting simpler materials and problems first, arranging objectivesin a progressive and logical sequence, and applying other techniquesthat facilitate making correct actions or explain adequate behavior--these all motivate behavior.Continued on next pageAFH 36-2235, Volume  2  2 SEPTEMBER 200271Class 4: Adequatefeedback-  Praise for accurate performance and informative feedback workbetter than threats or negative comments.-  Feedback given soon after performance should emphasize what are- the acceptable aspects of performance.Information correcting errors or guiding performance may be mostuseful given just before another opportunity to perform.72AFH 36-2235, Volume 2   2 SEPTEMBER 2002Designing Effective IllustrationsImportant findingDiagrams, graphs, photographs, and illustrations improve studentlearning.Benefits of utilizingillustrationsThe following benefits from utilizing illustrations are:- Illustrations enhance instructional text and help students remembercontent.-  Color illustrations encourage students to closely examine materials;color should be used especially to cue what is being learned.Good illustrationsGood illustrations should have the following characteristics:- - - - Illustrations should be as simple as possible to reduce confusion.Illustrations should be directly related to the lessons.  Those whichare not are often more distracting than helpful.Illustrations with highlighted or labeled information aids learning bymaking critical items more apparent.Illustrations to show various switches on a complex system are a wayof avoiding clutter.AnimationAnimation, which is the use of several visuals in rapid succession tosimulate motion, may increase student attention.  This technique is usefulwhen the content is not appealing.Continued on next pageAFH 36-2235, Volume  2  2 SEPTEMBER 200273Example ofcontrastedillustrationsTwo illustrations, taken from Montague and Knirk, are contrasted inFigure 5.

Contrasted Illustrations.74AFH 36-2235, Volume 2   2 SEPTEMBER 2002Formative and Summative EvaluationImportant findingTrying out instruction determines its overall effectiveness and efficiency.Formative evaluationdefinedFormative evaluation is performed while an instructional program isbeing developed.  It identifies and removes the most obvious errors in theinstruction, obtains initial reactions to the content from the students, andprevents compounding errors.  The evidence collected is used to “form”the instructional program.Questions answeredin formativeevaluationQuestions that should be asked during this type of evaluation shouldidentify the students’ perceptions of strengths and weaknesses of theinstructional materials:Is the instruction interesting?- -  Do the students understand what they are supposed to learn?-  Are the materials directly related to the stated objectives?-  How long do the students take to complete the material provided?Does this confirm planning?This type of student feedback can be extremely useful for the developer.Summativeevaluation definedSummative evaluation, on the other hand, is usually undertaken wheninstructional development is complete using a larger sample of students.Its purpose is to provide “summed” evidence about how well aninstructional program works.AFH 36-2235, Volume  2  2 SEPTEMBER 200275Effective SimulationImportant findingEffective simulation provides systematic practice and feedback abouterrors, depicts how a device or system works but may violate physicaland temporal fidelity.Expensive simulatorsnot always bestExpensive simulators, which are physically faithful to actual equipment,may not provide as effective training as simple, part-task trainers thatsimulate only a few features.Complex simulatorsnot for new studentsComplex simulators may inhibit new students from keeping track oftasks, causing them not to see the results of their interactions with thesystem.Simulators for newstudentsSimulators intended to train new students may need to be designeddifferently from those intended to train advanced students.  New studentsneed extensive, simplified guidance and precise corrective feedback whileadvanced students may only need to broaden their knowledge and skills.SimulatoradvantagesSimulators offer many advantages in training:-  They are often cheaper than actual equipment.-  Dangerous critical tasks are best practiced using simulators.-  The effectiveness of a simulation results from the instructionalmethods incorporated into the device that support student learningrather than from the simple physical or functional similarity to anactual device.Design decisionsThe design decisions are based on ways to isolate, or discriminate cues,and ways to provide time compressed practice for skill developmentrather than on particular hardware or media.Analysis requiredNeeds and cost-effectiveness analyses must be performed beforeincorporating simulators into instructional programs.76AFH 36-2235, Volume 2   2 SEPTEMBER 2002Effective TestingImportant findingTesting needs to be geared closely to the goals of an education andtraining program.Purpose of testingTesting during and after instruction is used to indicate student progress,determine what students find difficult, and tailor individual assignmentsto overcome the difficulties.Testing focused onperformanceThe testing should be focused on performance requirements which arederived from analysis of the work trained individuals are expected to do.Means of testingVarious means of testing are used, including laboratory exerciseperformance, oral and written quizzes and tests, out of class assignments,classroom questions, and comprehensive performance tests.Job relatedassessmentAssessment needs to be as job-like as possible.  Performance tests shouldbe hands-on.  Pencil and paper tests of knowledge should be restricted tosafety and knowledge critical for job performance.  If workers usemanuals and books to find the information needed to carry out a task on-the-job, open-book testing should be used.Frequently testedstudentsWell-designed, performance oriented tests inform students about jobrequirements and guide their learning.  Frequently tested studentsoutperform less frequently tested ones.Knowledge andperformance testsStudents generally take two kinds of tests, knowledge and performancetests.-  Knowledge tests help instructors find out if the students have learnedinformation important for safety and knowledge important forperformance.-  Performance tests indicate student competence and provideinformation about both student and instruction inadequacies.Continued on next pageAFH 36-2235, Volume  2  2 SEPTEMBER 200277Prompt testing andfeedbackErrors that students make on tests and in class identify learning problemsthat need to be corrected.  Instructors need this information to provideprompt feedback to students on their performance and assignments andto help correct any difficulties they may have.78AFH 36-2235, Volume 2   2 SEPTEMBER 2002Instructional Objectives and TestsImportant findingObjectives and tests must correlate with each other.Derivation ofobjectivesObjectives are derived from the job performance and instructionalrequirements.Composition of tests Tests should be composed of the behaviors, conditions, and standardsreferenced in the objectives.Performance andknowledgePerformance objectives and tests emphasize hands-on requirements whileknowledge objectives and tests focus on information critical to jobperformance.AFH 36-2235, Volume  2  2 SEPTEMBER 200279Instructional Time DistributionImportant findingSpacing training over several sessions separated by other activities makestraining more effective than masses of concentrated practice.Students absorbStudents can absorb only a limited amount of information at one time.Designing shorterdistributive segmentsTraining can be made more effective by designing shorter, distributedlesson segments with periods of varied interspersed activities.  Drill forcertain skill enhancements can be made effective by using short sessionsof one particular drill separated by other drill activities.Distributive betterthan successiveTwo distributed sessions are twice as effective as two successivesessions.  Students’ achievements following mass practices are not ashigh as achievements in shorter, distributed sessions.80AFH 36-2235, Volume 2   2 SEPTEMBER 2002Promoting Student CooperationImportant findingPromoting cooperation among students in training facilitates academicachievement.Advantages ofpromoting studentcooperationSome advantages of promoting student cooperation are:- - - It is more effective than promoting interpersonal competition andindividual effort to outshine others in class.It may also assist subsequent team activities as students learn to worktogether.It promotes positive feelings of personal worth and positive attitudestoward the course content.Peer instructionArranging peer interaction in small groups to supplement regularclassroom and laboratory teaching helps slower and underachievingstudents to learn and succeed in school.Forms of peercooperationPeer cooperation can take a variety of forms:Benefits of studentcoaching-  Discussion groups, seminars, or tutorial groups led by teachingassistants.-  The proctor model, where senior students may assist individualstudents.-  Student learning groups that do not have an instructor or are self-directed, or senior students teaching entering students.Student coaching is useful in raising achievement in the following ways:-  The coaches benefit because they learn more about the material bypreparing and giving lessons to others.-  The effort of coaching usually raises achievement test scores.-  The effects are greatest in long cognitive courses and extensive drill-in-practice courses.-  Short courses that stress test-taking show the least improvementfrom coaching methods.-  Classes that use tests at the start of the course report strongercoaching effects than classes giving tests only at the end.Continued on next pageAFH 36-2235, Volume  2  2 SEPTEMBER 200281Utilizing lifeexperiencesStudents bring many life experiences into the classroom, which should beacknowledged, tapped and used.  They can learn well and much throughcooperative study with respected peers.82AFH 36-2235, Volume 2   2 SEPTEMBER 2002Memory AidsImportant findingMnemonic devices or coding systems help students recall importantinformation.Minimize memoryrequirementsThe most important point to remember in memory learning, especially inthe military, is that we need to minimize requirements to memorize. Weneed to do more to help students test application of knowledge early on.Rote memoryinefficientWhen faced with memory activities, learning by rote seems an inefficientway of remembering.Mnemonic deviceshelpWhen students are faced with a task requiring memory, they often try todevise a scheme to learn the task easier.  Teaching students mnemonicprocedures aids learning.Recall can beimprovedIndividuals can recall short-term a string of seven unrelated items likedigits or letters presented to them one at a time.  Recall performance canbe improved to many times beyond this seventh level by using a learningstrategy like coding items into more meaningful chunks, and bypracticing a lot.The Figure 6 shows data obtained from two persons who learned a wayto increase memory-span to exceptional performance levels (Ericsson &Chase, 1982).  The lighter line represents a person who was read stringsof digits and was asked to recall them.  He was a runner.  Some digitgroups reminded him of running times.  He coded 3- and 4-digit groupsas running times (e.g., 3492 was coded as 3 minutes 49.2 seconds).  Heconstructed other mnemonic associations such as ages and dates.  Thedarker line represents a person who was taught the memorizationscheme.  He was also a runner.AFH 36-2235, Volume  2  2 SEPTEMBER 200283Recall can beimproved(Continued)Figure 5.  Effectiveness of Cuing.Conclusion to figure6Both runners in figure 6 performed exceptionally.  The important point isthat coding schemes based on a person’s existing knowledge can serve aslearning strategies.  Good ones can be useful to all learners.Self-generatedschemesSelf-generated schemes are powerful tools in learning.Extensive practiceExtensive practice is necessary to develop skill.Many memory aidsThere are many kinds of memory aids.  Some formal devices composedof visual images or rhymes provide students mental cuing structures.Students learn the cuing structures first and associate each item of newinformation with one or more of the memorized cuing structures.Continued on next pageCuing structureUsually, the cuing structure is not conceptually related to the informationit cues.  Consider the rhyming peg-word mnemonic system, “One is abun, two is a shoe, three is a tree, etc.”  Students first memorize theordered rhymes.  Then, when they must learn an arbitrary set of items inorder, they relate the first with “bun”, the second with “shoe,” and so on.Instructions often suggest using visualization to help relate the items.84AFH 36-2235, Volume 2   2 SEPTEMBER 2002ConclusionMnemonic devices are effective in helping students recall unorganizednames and procedural data.AFH 36-2235, Volume  2  2 SEPTEMBER 200285Conclusion to Techniques for Education/Training SpecialistsSimilarities betweeninstructor andspecialistAfter looking at the instructional specialist we can see that some areasseem the same as the instructor’s concerns which proves that in someenvironments the instructor is also the specialist.We should look at the specialist both as a separate and interrelatedinstructional function depending on the environment.Expectations forspecialistsBy looking at the section as a separate function the instructionalspecialist now can:Theoretical-  Become assertive instructional leaders by emphasizing factors thatbring about excellence.-  Learn and understand scientific bases from education and trainingexcellence.-  Expect high quality and productivity from staff, instructors, andstudents.-  Promote interaction among instructors.-  Protect instruction from irrelevant demands.-  Adjust training to goals and to students through detailed evaluationof performance.-  Monitor development and empirical evaluation of trainingtechnologies.Hands On- Implement and monitor in-service staff training.-  Monitor and evaluate instructors and instruction.-  Develop well-structured, work-like education and trainingenvironment to support student learning.-  Assist instructors in providing feedback to students.-  Analyze and propose improvements in education and trainingeffectiveness and efficiency.-  Provide input to higher management regarding education and trainingpolicy.86AFH 36-2235, Volume 2   2 SEPTEMBER 2002Section DPhysical Classroom EnvironmentImportant findingClassroom lighting, color, temperature, humidity, and noise levels affectstudent perception, attention, and achievement.Properly designedA greater level of learning occurs in a well-designed learningenvironment than in a poorly designed one.Winter room climate A temperature range of 68-74 degrees F at 30 inches from the floor inthe winter is healthful and comfortable.  The humidity should be keptbetween 30-60%.Sedentary and activetasksThe maximum temperature for adult learners for sedentary tasks is 85degrees F and 65 degrees F for active tasks.NoiseBackground noise apparently interferes with learning or concentration insome learners more than others.Highest acceptablenoise levelThe highest level of background noise in a learning environment shouldnot exceed 45 dB.Optimum noise level Optimum noise level is 30 dB for a learning environment.Noise limitsNoise levels above 96db seriously impact student error rates.  Noiseeffects of continuous and intermittent pure tone, and noise at fairly lowlevels of 70dbA, results in a significant decrease of learner performancewhere high cognitive loading tasks are required.Continued on next pageAFH 36-2235, Volume  2  2 SEPTEMBER 200287Graphic example ofnoise effectsMany experiments were conducted studying the effects of noise onsustained attention.  The Figure 7 below illustrates the effects of noise onthe incidence or errors over time in a serial reaction task lasting 40 min.Precautions to eliminate the effects of acoustic cues were taken, whichincluded the use of a silent keyboard and ear defender headphones.  Inboth loud (90dbC and soft 60dbC) conditions the noise is switched off atthe end of the third quarter.Figure 6.   Effects of Noise on Student Error.Lighting ImportanceLight levels should be directly related to the viewing difficulty of thelearning tasks.  Insufficient illumination, glare, reflectance, shadows, lowbrightness contrast, and flickering affect human performance.  Goodlighting and color decisions increase human performance.Continued on next page88AFH 36-2235, Volume 2   2 SEPTEMBER 2002Lighting levelsLighting for reading tasks should be at the lighting level of 540-755 lux.Lighting for bench work should be at the lighting level of 540-1000 lux.Lighting for learning rooms should be at the lighting level of 500-750lux.Avoid lightingextremesExtreme light level contrast must be avoided.  Constant adaptation ofmoving from a brightly lit to a darker area can cause eyestrain andheadaches.Biological effect oflightingLighting has a profound biological effect on humans.  The quantity andquality of light are important.  Natural, full spectrum tubes (as opposedto traditional fluorescent tubes), reduces individual stress and aggression,and yet is more intellectually stimulating.Student preferencesfor lightingWhile light level preferences differ among individuals, bright lightingincreases achievement for most students.  Students preferring lowlighting did better under lower light conditions.  A learning environmentshould not be uniformly bright and students should be allowed to sitwhere their light preferences direct them.Windows?Data neither consistently support claims that windowless classrooms willallow increased concentration and higher achievement, nor the fear thatthe absence of windows will have harmful psychological or physicaleffects.Color importanceColor influences student learning, attitudes, and behavior. The impact ofcolor on an individual changes with age and with cultural background.Color directly influences physiology as measured by blood pressure,respiratory rate and reaction time.Color and timeColor has a direct relationship on an individual’s sense of time.  Redcauses more people to overestimate time, while greens and blues in theenvironment cause an underestimation of time.Bright colorsBright colors (such as red) tend to increase an individuals activity level.AFH 36-2235, Volume  2  2 SEPTEMBER 200289Choosing colorsTypes of objectives to be taught in an area should be considered inchoosing classroom or study area colors.  Some general guidelines forchoosing colors:-  Classrooms or laboratories: greens, blue-greens, gray, beige.-  Gyms: neutral tones or cool colors.-  Auditoriums: green, aqua, peach.-  Entry areas: pink (also useful in prison holding tanks to quietprisoners), or neutral tones.Changing colorsChanges in classroom colors can affect learners.  Painting the classrooma light neutral color and using floodlights to change the setting can affectindividual attitudes and change the focus area.90AFH 36-2235, Volume 2   2 SEPTEMBER 2002Chapter 3AUTOMATED TOOLSOverviewIntroductionOne of the most frequent suggestions for improving instructional systems isautomation.  Management information systems that track coursewaredevelopment have become necessary.  This is especially true for producingtraining for large weapon systems.Decision supporttoolsDecision support tools that assist with such tasks as designing instruction,selecting instructional strategies and media, are vital to expeditiousdevelopment of training.Automated toolsfor instructionaldevelopmentThis section identifies selected automated tools that facilitate Air Forceinstructional planning, design, development and delivery.
