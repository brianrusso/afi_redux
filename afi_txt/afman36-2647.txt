Scope.1.1.  The  vision  for  Institutional  Competency  (IC)  development  is  to  create  the  appropriatestrategies,  policies,  and  processes  required  to  prepare  all  Airmen  with  the  appropriateleadership expertise to accomplish assigned airpower missions.1.2.  AF  ICs  apply  to  all  Airmen  across  all  functional  communities  and  is  the  commontaxonomy used to implement the Continuum of Learning (CoL).2. Roles and Responsibilities.2.1.  Deputy Chief of Staff for Manpower, Personnel and Services (AF/A1) is the Office ofPrimary Responsibility for the ICs and establishes guidance as reflected in this AF Manual.2.2.  Director  of  Force  Development  (AF/A1D)  has  responsibility  for  ensuring  the  IC  Listand its components continue to meet AF professional and leadership requirements.2.3.  DELETED2.4.  DELETED2.5.  DELETED2.6.  DELETED3. Background.3.1.  As part of the CoL framework, the AF develops ICs by providing synergistic education,training,  and  experiential  opportunities  that  equip  Airmen  to  meet  the  challenges  of  adynamic  operational  environment.    The  ICs  have  replaced  the  Enduring  Competencies  andthe Total Force Competency List.3.2.  The  Institutional  Competency  Development  Programs  (ICDPs)  provide  leadershipknowledge and other attributes that allow Airmen to understand and possibly demonstrate thedesired  IC  proficiencies.  Actual  attainment  of  ICs  may  be  realized  later  or  in  conjunctionwith other education, training, or experiential opportunities.3.3.  The  ICDPs  are  officer  and  enlisted  Professional  Military  Education  (PME),  thecommissioning sources, Basic Military Training, and supervisory training (reference AFI 36-2301, Developmental Education).3.4.  The ICs are the foundation for developing PME programs as stated in AFI 36-2301.3.5.  Assessing the potential of human capital measurement is a critical element of the ForceDevelopment (FD) process.  Therefore, assessment data is instrumental in understanding howwell  the  competencies  are  understood  by  Airmen  and  how  they  help  leaders  achieve  FDgoals.3.6.  Competency assessment leads to more effective management of FD performance.  Theassessment effort consists of three phases:  (1) identification of IC proficiency gaps from themilitary  education  schools,  (2)  identification  for  IC  proficiency  gaps  from  the  militarytraining venues, and (3) a holistic effort to examine how training, education, and experiencecontribute  to  enhancing  competency  for  the  Total  Force  (TF).    The  assessment  process  isdiscussed in more detail in Paragraph 6.  4 4. Purpose.AFMAN36-2647  25 MARCH 2014 4.1.  Purposes of the ICs are to enhance leadership performance, set behavioral standards ofleadership  for  all  levels  of  the  TF,  and  translate  requirements  and  values  into  behavioralindicators.4.2.  As Airmen progress in their careers, they should focus on increasing their proficiency ineach of the required ICs via education and training opportunities, as well as deployments andassignments for themselves and development of those they lead or supervise.4.3.

Competencies  areobservable,  measurable  patterns  of  knowledge,  skills,  abilities,  behaviors,  and  othercharacteristics  needed  to  perform  institutional  or  occupational  functions  successfully.    Likethe  AF  Core  Values,  the  ICs  are  enduring  and  encompass  the  leadership  attributes  the  AFbelieves are critical to mission success.5.1.1.  DELETED 5.1.2.  DELETED AFMAN36-2647  25 MARCH 2014   5 5.2.  Competencies are delivered through the CoL that represents a combination of education, training,  and  experience  for  preparing  Airmen  for  progressively  higher  levels  of responsibility. 5.3.  The competencies are divided into three categories and these categories are linked to the AF leadership levels as explained in Doctrine Volume II, Leadership. 5.3.1.  Organizational  category  of  the  ICs  (Employing  Military  Capabilities,  Enterprise Perspective, Managing Organizations and Resources, and Strategic Thinking (is linked to the Strategic Vision Leadership Level and establishes policy and structure and articulates the vision for the organization. 5.3.2.  People/Team  category  of  the  ICs  (Leading  People  and  Fostering  Collaborative Relationships)  is  linked  to  the  Operational  Competence  Leadership  Level  and  set  the organizational climate. 5.3.3.  Personal  category  of  the  ICs  (Embodies  Airman  Culture  and  Communicating)  is linked  to  the  Tactical  Expertise  Leadership  Level  and  consists  of  those  competencies needed  in  face-to-face  and  interpersonal  relationships  that  directly  influence  human behavior and values. 5.4.  Airmen  require  varying  degrees  of  proficiency  in  each  of  the  sub-competencies.    The proficiency levels are measurable with action-type behavioral statements. 5.4.1.  The  proficiency  levels  describe  the  full  range  of  work  performed  within  a competency—from gaining understanding through expert application. 5.4.2.  Proficiency level definitions and descriptive behaviors for the ICs are contained in Attachment 2. 5.5.  Developmental efforts are synchronized across the CoL providing the appropriate IC at the  right  time  to  maximize  each  member’s  capabilities  and  their  collective  contributions  to the mission. 5.5.1.  These competencies are universal requirements with an enterprise perspective and are used to drive total force development. 5.5.2.  Members  acquire  desired  ICs  via  education,  training,  and  experience  as  stated  in the CoL. 5.6.  Developmental  venues  throughout  the  AF  utilize  the  ICs  in  designing,  executing,  and evaluating developmental programs. 5.6.1.  Individual Airman developmental planning should be addressed in terms of these competencies. 5.6.2.  Assessments  enable  the  identification  of  leadership  gaps  between  actual  and desired mastery of the ICs.  Methodologically sound assessment instruments are used to gather IC proficiency data for isolating strengths and areas for enhancement. 5.6.3.  The ICs and their use are addressed in Doctrine Volume II, Doctrine Annex 1-1, Force  Development,  AFPD  36-26,  Total  Force  Development;  AFI  36-2014, Commissioning  Education  Program;  AFI  36-2301;  and  AFI  36-2640,  Executing  Total Force Development.   6 AFMAN36-2647  25 MARCH 2014 5.7.  If a Functional Authority identifies a skill or ability not addressed by the IC List that is needed  by  all  Airmen,  recommendations  for  change  should  be  submitted  to  AF/A1DI  for review. 5.7.1.  Recommendations are vetted through F/A1 for consideration. 6. Assessment Strategy Scope.6.1.  Assessments are used to identify and close gaps in Airmen’s capabilities.6.1.1.  Individual leadership strengths are identified with recommendations for improving areas that need further refinement.  The TF has an opportunity to complete the individual assessments and use online resources to close gaps (reference Para 6.2). 6.1.2.  The organizational assessments are administered by the ICDPs. 6.2.  Some  of  the  benefits  of  the  assessment  process  include:    (1)  serving  as  a  catalyst  for creating  a  high  performance  workforce  to  increase  productivity;  (2)  identifying  gaps  that could exist in the execution of the competencies, allowing opportunity to improvement; (3) ensuring  competencies  are  delivered  as  designed  by  the  descriptive  behaviors  at  the appropriate  levels;  (4)  providing  a  foundation  for  the  creation  of  targeted  developmental plans;  (5)  improving  outcome  results  of  the  process;  and  (6)  maximizing  return  on investment. 6.2.1.

Individual  and  organizational  assessment  of  the  ICs  is  a  necessary  component  ofcompetency-based management because it identifies an Airman’s proficiency level based onspecific criteria and is demonstrated and sustained over time.7.2.  Individual  IC  assessment  instruments  for  the  TF  help  to  identify  leadership  strengthsand areas for improvement.  They are 180-degree feedback assessments.7.2.1.  The  180-degree  feedback  assessments  are  web-based  surveys  that  gather observational  information  about  performance  using  self  and  supervisor  evaluations.  AFMAN36-2647  25 MARCH 2014   7 These  assessments  will  assist  Airmen  and  their  supervisors  in  identifying  ICs  for development and serve as an aid in designing a focused development plan. 7.2.2.  Descriptive  behavior  proficiencies  are  used  to  construct  the  tactical,  operational, and  strategic  survey  instruments.    Airmen  select  the  appropriate  assessment  based  on where they are in their careers. 7.2.3.  These  180-degree  feedback  assessments  are  offered  at  the  Tactical  Leadership Level  for  E1-E4,  O1-O2,  and  GS1-8;  at  the  Operational  Competence  Leadership  Level for E5-E7, O3-O4, and GS9-13; and at the Strategic Vision Leadership Level at E8-E9, O5-General, and GS14-SES.  They are located on the AF Portal. 7.2.4.  The  web-based  generated  reports  provide  individual  Airmen  references  to education and training resources for closing competency gaps. 7.2.5.  The  virtual  Force  Development  Center,  located  on  the  AF  Portal  site,  is  a clearinghouse  of  leadership  development  resources.    The  center  features  learning programs and courses based on the ICs.  Resources are available for all Airmen. 7.3.  The  organizational  assessments  are  developed  and  administered  by  the  ICDPs  and  an Executive Summary is provided to AF/A1D depicting IC proficiency gaps. 7.3.1.  AFI  36-2301  provides  additional  information  about  the  review  and  validation process for PME curricula. 7.3.2.  The  curricula  at  the  ICDPs  are  mapped  to  the  ICs  at  the  prescribed  proficiency levels (reference Table A2.3). 7.4.  Components  in  the  IC  assessment  process  consist  of  identification  of  a  sound assessment  methodology;  development  of  assessment  survey  instruments;  assessment validation;  web-based  tool  implementation;  data  collection,  storage,  and  processing; reporting;  analysis;  and  improvement.    These  components  are  needed  to  streamline  the administrative elements of competency assessment. 7.5.  180-degree feedback assessment surveys are administered using a web-based system to administer,  collect,  process,  and  store  the  data  and  generate  reports  to  Airmen  and  their supervisors.  Reports direct Airmen to online resources for improving their IC performance. 7.6.  Feedback is a critical component of the assessment strategy.  It provides information to Airmen  on  their  competencies  and  helps  them  to  define  career  developmental  goals  and  a path to achieving those goals. GORDON O.
